00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:01,451
Previously on "This Is Us"...

2
00:00:01,461 --> 00:00:02,912
- Toby.
- Kate.

3
00:00:02,922 --> 00:00:04,731
I can't fall for a fat person right now.

4
00:00:04,741 --> 00:00:07,208
It's always gonna be about
the weight for me, Toby.

5
00:00:07,218 --> 00:00:09,493
I'm done dieting, okay?

6
00:00:14,366 --> 00:00:15,683
Wait.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,870
William: I wonder if I could
check on him from time to time.

8
00:00:19,872 --> 00:00:20,908
No.

9
00:00:20,918 --> 00:00:23,234
Hey, Mom! Hey, Miguel.

10
00:00:23,244 --> 00:00:24,926
I'm Rebecca. I'm Randall's mother.

11
00:00:24,928 --> 00:00:26,327
Very nice to meet you.

12
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:28,212
Uh, nice to meet you as well.

13
00:00:28,214 --> 00:00:32,183
Beth: It's in the book of poems that
Randall's had since he was a baby.

14
00:00:32,185 --> 00:00:34,535
The one I gave Rebecca back in the day.

15
00:00:34,537 --> 00:00:37,254
Beth: Rebecca, this is Beth.
Yeah, um, so William just told me

16
00:00:37,256 --> 00:00:39,156
something really interesting.

17
00:00:39,158 --> 00:00:41,063

- Get away, Shredder.
- Boys.

28
00:01:19,744 --> 00:01:21,798
I just ironed those shirts.

29
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,352
No roughhousing until we get
to Grandma and Grandpa's.

30
00:01:25,362 --> 00:01:27,528
And no roughhousing when we get
to Grandma and Grandpa's, either.

31
00:01:27,538 --> 00:01:30,624
I want you to just sit there
quietly, okay? Maybe mention

32
00:01:30,626 --> 00:01:33,093
what a good mom I am if it comes
up naturally in conversation.

33
00:01:33,095 --> 00:01:36,680
Kate: I hate this stupid
sweater. It's so itchy.

34
00:01:36,682 --> 00:01:39,750
I know, baby doll,
but Grandma knit it just for you.

35
00:01:39,752 --> 00:01:41,743
She didn't do a really good job.

36
00:01:41,753 --> 00:01:43,804
Randall: I hate going
to Grandma and Grandpa's.

37
00:01:43,806 --> 00:01:46,071
Whenever we take pictures,
they always say,

38
00:01:46,081 --> 00:01:48,972
"Okay, okay, now one
with just the twins."

39
00:01:48,982 --> 00:01:52,000
I will talk to them about that. Again.

40
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:55,966
Jack: Okay, get excited, people.
Annual Thanksgiving road trip.

41
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:57,900
I've got snacks.

42
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,653
I got Cool Ranch.

43
00:01:59,655 --> 00:02:01,638
I've got Paul Simon.

44
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,139
- Now everyone, go pee.
- We already peed.

45
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:06,310
Go pee again,
six-hour road trip, come on.

46
00:02:06,312 --> 00:02:08,745
- Go, go, go. Go, go, go.
- But... but we already went.

47
00:02:08,747 --> 00:02:11,665
Don't get anything
on your chinos, please.

48
00:02:11,667 --> 00:02:14,715
Do you hear me?
They inherited your aim, Jack.

49
00:02:15,508 --> 00:02:17,601
(laughs) Hey, cranberry looks great.

50
00:02:17,611 --> 00:02:20,123
I know. Great is not good enough,
it has to be perfect.

51
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:22,571
Because my sister's sweet
potato pie is gonna be perfect,

52
00:02:22,581 --> 00:02:25,495
and I can't stand to hear my
mother's passive-aggressive BS

53
00:02:25,497 --> 00:02:27,364
if my sauce is not absolutely perfect.

54
00:02:27,366 --> 00:02:30,103
Perfect. Babe, it is perfect.

55
00:02:30,113 --> 00:02:32,252
It is, it's perfect.
Or, as your mother would say,

56
00:02:32,254 --> 00:02:33,670
"Becky, it's to die for." (gasps)

57
00:02:33,672 --> 00:02:35,800
- Can I have the nutmeg, please?
- Oh. Yeah.

58
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:38,482
I'm sorry. I know this is not a fun way

59
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,327
- to spend the holiday.
- Not fun? Are you kidding me?

60
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:41,930
Listening to your sister's husband brag

61
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,931
about his expensive CD
player for three hours

62
00:02:43,933 --> 00:02:46,547
is the definition of fun.

63
00:02:46,557 --> 00:02:48,080
So, always thought that,

64
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:51,204
when my folks die, we get to
do our own thing, you know?

65
00:02:51,729 --> 00:02:55,125
Make up our own stupid
traditions with the kids.

66
00:02:55,691 --> 00:02:59,442
That's because you're a very,
very naive man.

67
00:02:59,452 --> 00:03:01,131
Yeah? Thank you.

68
00:03:01,133 --> 00:03:03,784
(boys yelling, Rebecca screams)

69
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:06,203
- Jack: Oh!
- Oops.

70
00:03:06,205 --> 00:03:07,626
Okay, okay.

71
00:03:07,636 --> 00:03:09,171
- Boys, change, change, change.
- Sorry.

72
00:03:09,181 --> 00:03:11,008
- Step over this and change.
- Randall: Sorry.

73
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,893
Woman: For me it's cranberry sauce.

74
00:03:12,895 --> 00:03:15,227
Sweet potatoes with marshmallow crust.

75
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:16,705
Bacon wrapped dates.

76
00:03:16,715 --> 00:03:20,083
Jell-O with the little pieces
of fruit floating on the inside

77
00:03:20,085 --> 00:03:21,852
- and then whipped cream on top.
- Oh!

78
00:03:21,854 --> 00:03:23,694
My weakness is stuffing.

79
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,789
- Mm.
- I could eat a whole bowl of it,

80
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:29,159
but this is my first Thanksgiving
since my gastric bypass surgery,

81
00:03:29,169 --> 00:03:30,911
so my stomach's now
the size of a walnut.

82
00:03:30,913 --> 00:03:34,014
Which means if I overdo it,
I'll be holed up in the bathroom

83
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:37,679
vomiting my guts out, while everybody
else is watching football. (laughs)

84
00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:39,519
But, hey, I've lost

85
00:03:39,521 --> 00:03:41,216
30 pounds now so far.

86
00:03:41,226 --> 00:03:43,190
So, worth it.

87
00:03:43,192 --> 00:03:45,108
- Right?
- Group Leader: Yes,

88
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,443
yes it is.

89
00:03:46,445 --> 00:03:48,128
Now, for everybody else,

90
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:50,714
Thanksgiving is full of triggers.

91
00:03:50,716 --> 00:03:52,466
So we have to stay vigilant.

92
00:03:52,468 --> 00:03:54,098
But I know you guys can do it.

93
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:55,986
(clapping)

94
00:04:01,285 --> 00:04:03,196
(mouth full): This is great.

95
00:04:03,206 --> 00:04:04,545
Mm.

96
00:04:04,555 --> 00:04:06,663
So, Thanksgiving in New York.

97
00:04:07,132 --> 00:04:08,964
It's gonna be great. The Big Apple.

98
00:04:08,974 --> 00:04:10,657
I hope your mom likes me.

99
00:04:10,943 --> 00:04:12,906
- Toby...
- You know, what am I worried about?

100
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:14,393
Parents love me,
I'll tell them the story

101
00:04:14,403 --> 00:04:18,127
about the time I met Streisand.
Parents love Streisand.

102
00:04:19,378 --> 00:04:22,245
(inhales deeply)

103
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:25,065
I don't think that you should
come with me to New York.

104
00:04:25,067 --> 00:04:26,565
(laughs)

105
00:04:26,575 --> 00:04:28,486
What? Why? Why not?

106
00:04:30,357 --> 00:04:32,850
Because I think we should take a break.

107
00:04:33,836 --> 00:04:35,208
A... a break?

108
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:36,693
Mm-hmm.

109
00:04:37,122 --> 00:04:38,378
Why?

110
00:04:39,783 --> 00:04:42,130
Because I've been dreading this date.

111
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:46,053
Because I knew that you would
eat that and I would eat this.

112
00:04:46,634 --> 00:04:49,891
And because ever since you stopped
dieting, I have felt weak.

113
00:04:49,901 --> 00:04:51,874
Oh, no, I was weak.

114
00:04:51,884 --> 00:04:54,885
The other night I stuffed my
face full of powdered donuts,

115
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:57,095
and then I cried myself to sleep.

116
00:05:00,393 --> 00:05:02,919
Yup.

117
00:05:03,316 --> 00:05:06,117
And, listen, if you don't want
to lose weight, that's fine

118
00:05:06,127 --> 00:05:09,604
because that's your choice.

119
00:05:09,606 --> 00:05:10,805
(voice breaking): But I told...

120
00:05:10,807 --> 00:05:12,207
(clears throat)

121
00:05:12,209 --> 00:05:14,192
I told you that when I met you,

122
00:05:14,194 --> 00:05:17,428
that I couldn't fall for a fat person.

123
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:20,114
But you did.

124
00:05:20,116 --> 00:05:22,183
You fell-you fell for me.

125
00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:25,737
So now what?

126
00:05:25,739 --> 00:05:28,439
You're just gonna throw me away?

127
00:05:37,124 --> 00:05:39,184
I used to watch romantic comedies

128
00:05:39,186 --> 00:05:43,288
where... the perfect,
charming, Hugh-Grant-guy

129
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:48,359
would bend over backwards
for the woman that he loves.

130
00:05:48,361 --> 00:05:52,831
And I... would think,
"If I could have that,

131
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:54,732
that I would be happy."

132
00:05:54,734 --> 00:05:56,718
And then I met you.

133
00:05:58,371 --> 00:06:00,772
(inhales deeply)

134
00:06:00,774 --> 00:06:02,257
And you were better than them.

135
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:05,309
You were better than my
wildest dreams. (chuckles)

136
00:06:06,313 --> 00:06:07,779
Um...

137
00:06:07,781 --> 00:06:10,041
(clears throat, then sniffs)

138
00:06:10,517 --> 00:06:13,098
But I'm still not happy, Toby.

139
00:06:15,672 --> 00:06:19,190
Um, and it's not just about my weight.

140
00:06:19,192 --> 00:06:20,692
It's...

141
00:06:20,694 --> 00:06:22,794
it's just...

142
00:06:22,796 --> 00:06:24,479
I've got to get a handle on myself,

143
00:06:24,481 --> 00:06:27,048
on the weight and on all of it.

144
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,484
And I, um...

145
00:06:29,486 --> 00:06:33,805
God, I-I need that more than
anything right now, and I want it.

146
00:06:33,807 --> 00:06:35,823
I want it more than anything right now.

147
00:06:35,825 --> 00:06:38,676
(inhales deeply)

148
00:06:38,678 --> 00:06:39,844
(clears throat)

149
00:06:39,846 --> 00:06:42,113
Even more than me?

150
00:06:42,115 --> 00:06:44,115
♪ ♪

151
00:06:47,003 --> 00:06:48,920
(sniffs)

152
00:06:48,922 --> 00:06:52,056
(exhales slowly)

153
00:06:55,262 --> 00:06:58,412
Well, it sounds like you've
made up your mind, so...

154
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:07,889
(crying and sniffling)

155
00:07:13,658 --> 00:07:17,825
Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.
We're back Monday at 10:00.

156
00:07:21,426 --> 00:07:24,639
Uh, Olivia, I'm guessing you probably
don't celebrate Thanksgiving, right?

157
00:07:25,316 --> 00:07:27,880
My mum's American.

158
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:30,545
I am definitely not getting
together with relatives I hate

159
00:07:30,547 --> 00:07:32,931
so we can gorge ourselves on dry bird,

160
00:07:32,933 --> 00:07:34,565
while pretending that we'd
ever have anything to do

161
00:07:34,567 --> 00:07:37,248
with each other if we
weren't related by blood.

162
00:07:37,258 --> 00:07:39,854
Wow. So what are you gonna do then?

163
00:07:39,856 --> 00:07:42,290
I shall be going to my favorite
dive bar in Sunset Park

164
00:07:42,292 --> 00:07:43,858
where they'll be playing Rocky II.

165
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,310
Because they're always playing Rocky II,

166
00:07:45,312 --> 00:07:47,462
and I shall watch Rocky II
with my favorite

167
00:07:47,464 --> 00:07:49,080
borderline senile bartender, Benny,

168
00:07:49,082 --> 00:07:51,416
whilst drinking three to five bourbons.

169
00:07:51,418 --> 00:07:53,260
Have a good break, Kevin.

170
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,355
You should celebrate
Thanksgiving with me

171
00:07:55,365 --> 00:07:57,996
and my family, if you,
you know, if you want.

172
00:07:58,128 --> 00:07:59,173
Kevin.

173
00:07:59,175 --> 00:08:01,809
I'm not spending
Thanksgiving in New Jersey

174
00:08:01,811 --> 00:08:04,629
meeting the walking
slices of Wonder Bread

175
00:08:04,631 --> 00:08:07,243
responsible for... this.

176
00:08:08,414 --> 00:08:13,387
Okay, Wonder Bread. Wow, all

My family is, uh, we're like
whatever the most interesting

00:08:15,659 --> 00:08:18,552
kind of bread would be... You
know, we're like multigrain bread.

179
00:08:18,562 --> 00:08:20,935
Except we're not that healthy.
We're like, uh...

180
00:08:20,945 --> 00:08:22,130
we would be ciabatta bread.

181
00:08:22,132 --> 00:08:24,803
That's what we are. Check this out.

182
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:28,470
My mother is, uh, married to
my dead dad's best friend.

183
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,521
I have a twin sister who
is seriously overweight.

184
00:08:30,523 --> 00:08:32,473
And I have an adopted black brother

185
00:08:32,475 --> 00:08:35,743
who just recently reconnected with
his biological father who is dying.

186
00:08:35,745 --> 00:08:39,580
Now, don't you want to
see that up close, huh?

are on relaxation duty.

in the kitchen for us?

302
00:12:39,463 --> 00:12:41,878
- Absolutely. On my way.
- Good.

303

304

- You have had enough time.

00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:28,091
I need you to find the time to do it
before you leave this house tonight...

320

00:14:30,589 --> 00:14:32,238
Look at that. Ooh.

348
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,724
51 degrees in New York City.

349
00:14:34,726 --> 00:14:37,277
Rebecca: So, how are things with
the new assistant working out?

350
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,645
Uh, Kelsey?

351
00:14:38,647 --> 00:14:39,679
- Yeah.
- Right?

352
00:14:39,681 --> 00:14:40,811
Uh, not great.

353
00:14:40,821 --> 00:14:44,083
She's been adding little one-liners
to her e-mail signature.

354
00:14:44,085 --> 00:14:48,054
Monday's was, "If the glass
is half-empty, add tequila."

355
00:14:48,056 --> 00:14:49,255
She sounds fun.

356
00:14:49,257 --> 00:14:52,357
Yeah, she sent that to the
president of Chase Bank.

357
00:14:52,844 --> 00:14:54,844
- Hey, sweetheart, um...
- Hmm?

358
00:14:54,846 --> 00:14:58,675
We should find some time
to try and talk today.

359
00:14:58,685 --> 00:15:00,767
- Kevin: Hello, hello.
- That's Kevin and his date.

360
00:15:00,777 --> 00:15:02,502
- Kevin: Girls?
- Let's go say hi. To be continued.

361
00:15:02,504 --> 00:15:04,737
- Annie: Hey, Uncle Kevin.
- Kevin: How are you?

362
00:15:04,739 --> 00:15:06,189
- Good.
- Good to see you, all right.

363
00:15:06,191 --> 00:15:07,340
- Got my keys?
- Yup.

364
00:15:07,342 --> 00:15:08,892
Thank you. Hey, how you doing?

365
00:15:08,894 --> 00:15:10,059
- Mom.
- Hello, sweetheart.

366
00:15:10,061 --> 00:15:12,378
- How are you?
- Happy Thanksgiving.

367
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,063
Kevin: Happy Thanksgiving,
good to see you.

368
00:15:14,065 --> 00:15:15,665
- It's good to see you.
- Miguel: Hey.

369
00:15:15,902 --> 00:15:17,083
- Miguel.
- Kevin.

370
00:15:17,085 --> 00:15:19,085
- Yep.
- How's, uh, the play going?

371
00:15:19,087 --> 00:15:20,720
Having fun at rehearsals?

372
00:15:20,722 --> 00:15:22,622
Fun? (chuckles)

373
00:15:23,072 --> 00:15:25,708
No, Miguel, I'm not having any fun.
It's emotionally brutal work.

374
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,304
- But thank you for asking.
- Kevin.

375
00:15:27,314 --> 00:15:29,596
Okay. Look, uh, this is, oh, Olivia.

376
00:15:29,598 --> 00:15:31,498
- Hi... Hello.
- Kevin: Yeah.

377
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,665
- You're pretty.
- Thank you.

378
00:15:34,502 --> 00:15:36,499
You look like Katy Perry.

379
00:15:36,509 --> 00:15:39,433
Uh, this is Tess and Annie and
you've met my brother, Randall.

380
00:15:39,443 --> 00:15:40,680
The adopted one.

381
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,492
- Yeah.
- (Kevin clears throat)

382
00:15:43,406 --> 00:15:46,029
- Hi, Olivia. I'm Rebecca.
- Hi.

383
00:15:46,031 --> 00:15:47,972
Randall and Kevin's mother.
Really glad you could

384
00:15:47,982 --> 00:15:49,299
join us for Thanksgiving.

385
00:15:49,301 --> 00:15:50,783
Well, thank you so much for having me.

386
00:15:50,785 --> 00:15:53,878
I mean, I hate Thanksgiving, but still.

387
00:15:53,888 --> 00:15:56,439
- You're very welcome.
- Randall: Everyone, uh,

388
00:15:56,441 --> 00:15:57,540
- get our shoes on.
- Good idea.

389
00:15:57,542 --> 00:16:01,137
Time to get our hike on.
Hey, uh, Beth, William, let's go.

390
00:16:01,147 --> 00:16:02,946
Well, we don't do the hike, do we?

391
00:16:02,948 --> 00:16:05,331
Oh, absolutely.
Pearson Family tradition.

392
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,734
You're gonna love it. (laughs)

393
00:16:07,736 --> 00:16:09,752
You're gonna love it.

394
00:16:09,754 --> 00:16:13,729
You're not. You're not gon... You're
gonna, you're gonna tolerate it.

395
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:15,934
What's exciting, The guy
doing the sets won a Tony.

396
00:16:15,944 --> 00:16:17,558
- Rebecca: Really?
- Kevin: Yeah.

397
00:16:17,568 --> 00:16:19,762
- Rebecca: That is so great.
- Right?

398
00:16:19,764 --> 00:16:22,999
What is the, uh,
the name of the play again?

399
00:16:23,001 --> 00:16:24,701
(scoffs)

400
00:16:24,703 --> 00:16:26,135
What? Are you serious?

401
00:16:26,137 --> 00:16:27,470
- The Back of an Egg.
- Back of an Egg.

402
00:16:27,472 --> 00:16:28,844
Yeah, Mom, I told you like eight times.

403
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:30,915
I know, I know, I'm sorry. I just, uh...

404
00:16:30,925 --> 00:16:33,226
Grandma and Grandpa,
Tess found a dead bird.

405
00:16:33,228 --> 00:16:34,921
Oh, don't touch it. Here, show me where.

406
00:16:34,931 --> 00:16:36,658
- Come see!
- Okay, come show it to me.

407
00:16:36,668 --> 00:16:40,217
So, your parents, they don't
mind you skipping Thanksgiving?

408
00:16:40,543 --> 00:16:42,752
- No.
- Really?

409
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,325
My mom used to make very
elaborate Thanksgivings.

410
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,725
She'd even make three kinds of pie.

411
00:16:48,727 --> 00:16:52,662
The right kind of pie could save
us from our miserable selves.

412
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:55,477
Then, inevitably,
Dad's beeper would go off,

413
00:16:55,487 --> 00:16:58,395
and he'd pretend it was the hospital,

414
00:16:58,405 --> 00:17:01,888
even though we all knew he
was banging some nurse.

415
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,990
And Mom would get sad...

416
00:17:03,992 --> 00:17:06,984
and drunk and angry.

417
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,830
You know, the funny thing is,
we had all those pies

418
00:17:10,832 --> 00:17:14,854
and I don't think we ever
once made it to dessert.

419
00:17:15,233 --> 00:17:18,588
It pissed me off 'cause
I really like pie.

420
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:20,707
No, no. Relax, relax.

421
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:22,842
- Have a seat.
- All right.

422
00:17:22,844 --> 00:17:24,827
(groans)

423
00:17:29,551 --> 00:17:31,111
You know, I can go get the car.

424
00:17:31,121 --> 00:17:34,252
No, no, no, no, no.
Just give me a minute.

425
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:35,635
Okay.

426
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:40,855
Hey, what'd you used to
do for Thanksgiving?

427
00:17:40,865 --> 00:17:43,122
Oh, I'd spend it with my sober friends.

428
00:17:43,132 --> 00:17:45,093
- Cats I met in the meetings.
- Mmm.

429
00:17:45,103 --> 00:17:47,058
A lot of 'em are musicians.

430
00:17:47,278 --> 00:17:48,667
Most of us didn't have family.

431
00:17:48,677 --> 00:17:51,460
None we were on speaking
terms with, anyway.

432
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,735
So we'd have a big potluck.

433
00:17:53,745 --> 00:17:56,463
Everyone would bring their
instruments, and we'd jam all night.

434
00:17:56,473 --> 00:17:58,013
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

435
00:17:58,023 --> 00:18:00,976
Otis Redding, Muddy Waters, you name it.

436
00:18:00,986 --> 00:18:02,617
One of the guys had an old tape player.

437
00:18:02,627 --> 00:18:05,468
He would record us for posterity.

438
00:18:06,545 --> 00:18:09,939
Hmm. I was too sick to
attend last year's, so...

439
00:18:09,941 --> 00:18:12,627
I started a whole new
Thanksgiving tradition.

440
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:15,273
I'd listen to those tapes,

441
00:18:15,283 --> 00:18:18,114
and eat an entire Marie
Callender's "pee-can" pie.

442
00:18:18,116 --> 00:18:19,315
(both laughing)

443
00:18:19,317 --> 00:18:21,417
Or "puh-kahn" pie.

444
00:18:23,406 --> 00:18:26,863
Oh, man, I wish I would
have packed those tapes.

445
00:18:27,462 --> 00:18:28,975
Oh, well.

446
00:18:29,321 --> 00:18:31,728
(sighs)

447
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:34,364
How long did you say this hike was?

448
00:18:34,366 --> 00:18:37,817
Exactly 3.4 miles.

449
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:42,305
Rebecca: Jack, it's gonna get dark soon.

450
00:18:43,139 --> 00:18:44,957
What do we do now?

451
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:48,177
(exhales)

452
00:18:49,626 --> 00:18:50,983
Now we walk.

453
00:18:52,053 --> 00:18:53,783
- Kate: What?
- Guys.

454
00:18:53,785 --> 00:18:56,006
Come on. It'll be like
a fun little hike.

455
00:18:56,016 --> 00:18:57,343
Mom.

456
00:18:57,651 --> 00:18:59,140
(groaning)

457
00:19:05,673 --> 00:19:06,837
Hey, Randall.

458
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:08,797
They're finally letting us on the plane,

459
00:19:08,807 --> 00:19:10,308
four hours later.

460
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:12,777
Um, so I'm gonna miss the movie.

461
00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:15,329
But I should make it in time for dinner.

462
00:19:15,872 --> 00:19:17,448
It's just gonna be me.

463
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:19,217
I'll explain later.

464
00:19:19,219 --> 00:19:20,841
Okay, bye.

465
00:19:34,634 --> 00:19:37,184
Don't worry, I bought both these seats.

466
00:19:38,037 --> 00:19:40,021
(slight laugh)

467
00:19:41,641 --> 00:19:43,207
Here's your seat belt extender.

468
00:19:43,209 --> 00:19:45,293
- Let's get you strapped in.
- Oh, I-I got it.

469
00:19:45,295 --> 00:19:47,195
- Thank you.
- You welcome.

470
00:19:53,528 --> 00:19:56,127
Pilot: Hi, folks,
this your captain speaking.

471
00:19:56,137 --> 00:19:57,798
We've got a bit of a wait ahead of us,

472
00:19:57,808 --> 00:20:00,426
as we are 12th in line for takeoff.

473
00:20:01,316 --> 00:20:02,927
Rebecca: How are we not there yet?

474
00:20:02,929 --> 00:20:05,568
I feel like we've been walking for days.

475
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:08,238
Kevin: What was that sound?

476
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:10,234
Oh, that's probably just
an animal in the woods.

477
00:20:10,236 --> 00:20:11,802
- What?
- Seriously?

478
00:20:11,804 --> 00:20:13,204
There are animals in the woods?

479
00:20:13,206 --> 00:20:15,189
Rebecca: Okay, okay,
guys, I have an idea.

480
00:20:15,191 --> 00:20:18,586
Why don't we play a game?

481
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,128
- Called The Thanksgiving Game?
- Jack: Great idea.

482
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:24,765
Everyone is going to tell us

483
00:20:24,767 --> 00:20:27,551
what their Thanksgiving is gonna
be like when they grow up.

484
00:20:27,553 --> 00:20:29,048
- Kev, you start.
- Easy.

485
00:20:29,058 --> 00:20:30,755
I'm gonna be a quarterback
for the Steelers.

486
00:20:30,757 --> 00:20:32,523
I'll play a big game on Thanksgiving,

487
00:20:32,525 --> 00:20:34,265
then go home and eat an entire turkey.

488
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:35,826
All right, you've given
that some real thought.

489
00:20:35,828 --> 00:20:37,561
Rebecca: Randall, what about you,
bud, what are you gonna do?

490
00:20:37,563 --> 00:20:39,613
I'm not gonna celebrate Thanksgiving.

491
00:20:39,615 --> 00:20:40,781
Why not?

492
00:20:40,783 --> 00:20:42,295
When you're a grown up,

493
00:20:42,524 --> 00:20:44,427
you don't have to do stuff you hate.

494
00:20:44,437 --> 00:20:46,454
Kevin: I didn't know no
Thanksgiving was an option.

495
00:20:46,456 --> 00:20:48,819
- I'm not doing it either.
- Me, neither.

496
00:20:48,829 --> 00:20:51,759
- I hate Thanksgiving.
- You guys, come on.

497
00:20:51,761 --> 00:20:54,745
Grandma and Grandpa aren't that bad.

498
00:20:55,493 --> 00:20:57,801
- What?
- It's not just them.

499
00:20:57,933 --> 00:20:59,350
It's you.

500
00:21:01,675 --> 00:21:04,188
You're always mean when
we're at their house and...

501
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:06,123
you always have this weird...

502
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:07,608
- and high voice.
- Jack: Okay.

503
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:09,727
Okay. Don't listen to 'em.

504
00:21:09,729 --> 00:21:11,228
Kids are delusional from the cold.

505
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,446
- Keep walking.
- Randall: The cold?

506
00:21:12,448 --> 00:21:14,355
Zip it, you.

507
00:21:15,084 --> 00:21:18,019
Come on, don't listen to 'em.

508
00:21:18,021 --> 00:21:19,737
Come on.

509
00:21:20,525 --> 00:21:21,969
(door opens)

510
00:21:21,979 --> 00:21:24,884
Okay, everybody get cider,
movie starts in ten.

511
00:21:24,894 --> 00:21:27,395
Okay. Jackets off, girls.

512
00:21:31,884 --> 00:21:34,610
Hey, um, I'm gonna run to
William's apartment real quick.

513
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:35,455
What

514
00:21:35,465 --> 00:21:37,389
No, I know, I know. But I'll
be back before the movie's over.

515
00:21:37,399 --> 00:21:39,724
- You got to keep an eye on the turkey.
- No. I mean, why are you...?

516
00:21:39,726 --> 00:21:42,295
Look, he's... he's got these
tapes of him and his friends

517
00:21:42,305 --> 00:21:43,877
playing music, and listening to them

518
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:45,933
is kind of his Thanksgiving thing.

519
00:21:45,943 --> 00:21:47,735
You're gonna drive two hours

520
00:21:47,745 --> 00:21:49,183
- to go pick up some tapes?
- I think...

521
00:21:49,185 --> 00:21:53,070
That's a little extreme. this may
be his last Thanksgiving, Beth.

522
00:21:54,587 --> 00:21:56,939
Yeah, so that's why you need
to get your ass on the road.

523
00:21:56,949 --> 00:21:59,353
- Hurry up.
- Thank you.

524
00:21:59,908 --> 00:22:02,763
- Daddy, is it time to start the movie?
- Yep. You guys

525
00:22:02,765 --> 00:22:05,066
watch it without me. Uh,
Daddy's got to run a quick errand.

526
00:22:05,068 --> 00:22:07,695
Oh, but you, uh,
you love Police Academy III.

527
00:22:07,705 --> 00:22:10,497
I know. That Steve Guttenberg
gets me every time.

528
00:22:10,507 --> 00:22:13,039
Why don't I come with you
and keep you company?

529
00:22:13,049 --> 00:22:15,543
And miss the movie? That's your
favorite Thanksgiving tradition.

530
00:22:15,545 --> 00:22:18,546
No, ma'am. I'll be fine.
Oh, um, Kate got a new flight.

531
00:22:18,548 --> 00:22:20,364
She'll be here just in time for dinner.

532
00:22:20,366 --> 00:22:23,401
She's not bringing the boyfriend.
Sounds like drama.

533
00:22:23,403 --> 00:22:25,647
Don't know what happened.
All right. Bye. See you.

534
00:22:25,657 --> 00:22:27,238
I'll see you soon, William.

535
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,590
(door opens)

536
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,541
- Rebecca: I will go get you some cider.
- (door closes)

537
00:22:30,543 --> 00:22:31,976
Miguel: Thank you, honey.

538
00:22:34,343 --> 00:22:35,545
Hey.

539
00:22:36,338 --> 00:22:37,612
Hey.

540
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,650
So, I, uh...

541
00:22:40,417 --> 00:22:41,552
I know that you and Thanksgiving

542
00:22:41,554 --> 00:22:43,370
have a... somewhat of a spotty past,

543
00:22:43,372 --> 00:22:46,090
but, um... I wanted you to know

544
00:22:46,092 --> 00:22:49,059
that no matter what happens this year,

545
00:22:49,061 --> 00:22:51,462
you're gonna make it to the pie.

546
00:22:51,464 --> 00:22:53,564
(Police Academy music playing)

547
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,537
- Miguel: Hey, Kevin.
- Yeah...

548
00:22:59,539 --> 00:23:01,005
Hey.

549
00:23:01,007 --> 00:23:02,406
Uh...

550
00:23:02,734 --> 00:23:04,859
I was just kind of wondering if...

551
00:23:04,861 --> 00:23:07,765
maybe this year, I could wear the hat?

552
00:23:09,148 --> 00:23:11,733
- Oh, you want to wear the hat?
- Yeah, I do.

553
00:23:11,743 --> 00:23:13,551
Every year we do your
family's traditions,

554
00:23:13,553 --> 00:23:15,432
which is fine. I-I enjoy them.

555
00:23:15,442 --> 00:23:18,005
But I think it would
be nice if just once

556
00:23:18,007 --> 00:23:21,252
I got to wear the hat
for Tess and Annie.

557
00:23:21,649 --> 00:23:23,343
Well, uh, gee.

558
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,713
(grunts) Miguel,
that's not gonna happen.

559
00:23:25,715 --> 00:23:28,364
See, my... my dad wore the hat.

560
00:23:28,779 --> 00:23:31,337
And now Randall and I wear
the hat. We take turns

561
00:23:31,347 --> 00:23:32,736
wearing the hat. This year it's my turn

562
00:23:32,738 --> 00:23:34,751
to wear the hat. So... you know,

563
00:23:34,761 --> 00:23:35,927
no dice.

564
00:23:35,937 --> 00:23:37,158
Okay.

565
00:23:41,188 --> 00:23:43,464
Can you believe that guy? Wants
to wear the hat. I wear the hat

566
00:23:43,466 --> 00:23:46,395
and Randall wears the hat.
That's how we do it.

567
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:48,802
I'm sorry. I can't do this.

568
00:23:51,212 --> 00:23:52,701
Can't do what?

569
00:23:55,261 --> 00:23:57,673
I can't be who you want me to be.

570
00:23:57,683 --> 00:23:59,712
- I should... I should go.
- (door closes)

571
00:23:59,722 --> 00:24:03,633
- What? Hold on. Wait a minute.
- Please, don't try to stop me.

572
00:24:03,643 --> 00:24:07,343
And please stop trying to see
something in me that isn't there.

573
00:24:08,909 --> 00:24:10,478
Olivia...

574
00:24:15,301 --> 00:24:17,565
- Hey, I see something.
- What?

575
00:24:17,567 --> 00:24:18,883
Jack: There it is.

576
00:24:18,885 --> 00:24:19,917
- Randall: Oh, yes!
- Kevin: Oh, yeah!

577
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,185
- Come on.
- Thank you!

578
00:24:21,187 --> 00:24:22,553
Are they gonna get us
a tow truck in there?

579
00:24:22,555 --> 00:24:25,072
Yes, baby, because it's
a Thanksgiving miracle!

580
00:24:25,074 --> 00:24:26,549
- Rebecca: Come on.
- Kate: Yay!

581
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:27,941
Jack: Come on.

582
00:24:27,943 --> 00:24:31,061
Yeah. I can't get you
a tow truck tonight.

583
00:24:32,214 --> 00:24:33,621
Why not?

584
00:24:35,356 --> 00:24:38,362
Because it's Thanksgiving.
Everything's closed.

585
00:24:38,372 --> 00:24:40,003
If I were you, I'd just
call someone to pick you up

586
00:24:40,005 --> 00:24:42,055
and deal with the car in the morning.

587
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:44,842
Okay. Why don't you get
the kids some snacks

588
00:24:44,852 --> 00:24:47,628
to tide them over,
and I will go call my parents.

589
00:24:48,764 --> 00:24:51,812
Jack: Go sit in the booth.
Come on. Sit down.

590
00:24:53,235 --> 00:24:55,385
(exhales)

591
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,300
- Could we get... those hot dogs to go?
- (phone rings)

592
00:25:02,394 --> 00:25:04,781
Hi, Mom. It's me.

593
00:25:05,213 --> 00:25:09,566
Yeah, I know what time it is.
I'm sorry. We had a tire blow out.

594
00:25:10,555 --> 00:25:14,555
Yeah. Everybody's okay.
We're fine. We're okay.

595
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:17,676
I didn't call you sooner because
I couldn't call you sooner.

596
00:25:17,686 --> 00:25:19,632
That's why I'm calling you now.

597
00:25:19,642 --> 00:25:21,862
I know how hard you work
to prepare dinner, Mom.

598
00:25:21,864 --> 00:25:24,448
Do you really think that we
wanted to drive through a fence?

599
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:27,217
Can you just have Dad come and...

600
00:25:27,219 --> 00:25:28,535
(sighs)

601
00:25:31,724 --> 00:25:32,856
No.

602
00:25:32,858 --> 00:25:34,908
No, no, no, no, no. I am not gonna

603
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:36,977
subject my kids to that this year.

604
00:25:36,979 --> 00:25:38,378
So...

605
00:25:39,231 --> 00:25:40,981
we're not coming.

606
00:25:41,568 --> 00:25:43,643
We're not coming anymore.

607
00:25:44,295 --> 00:25:45,852
Sorry.

608
00:25:47,117 --> 00:25:48,949
- Hmm.
- Okay.

609
00:25:50,059 --> 00:25:51,875
So, what's the new plan?

610
00:25:51,877 --> 00:25:53,110
(sighs)

611
00:25:56,828 --> 00:25:59,305
Uh, I guess we're having Thanksgiving

612
00:25:59,315 --> 00:26:01,034
at the Pinewood Lodge. Pinewood Lodge.

613
00:26:01,036 --> 00:26:03,170
I love it. I love it.

614
00:26:03,742 --> 00:26:05,756
I love it.

615
00:26:06,046 --> 00:26:08,609
I can't believe I just did that.

616
00:26:09,409 --> 00:26:11,112
- I really did that.
- We'll worry about it later. You did.

617
00:26:11,122 --> 00:26:13,146
Jack: Let's get the kids.

618
00:26:17,646 --> 00:26:19,892
I just came out for some air.

619
00:26:20,112 --> 00:26:22,007
I'm waiting for my Uber.

620
00:26:23,484 --> 00:26:25,309
I don't know what that is.

621
00:26:34,938 --> 00:26:36,991
How does it feel to be dying?

622
00:26:46,779 --> 00:26:49,082
It feels...

623
00:26:49,863 --> 00:26:54,780
like all these beautiful pieces of
life are flying around me and...

624
00:26:54,992 --> 00:26:57,307
I'm trying to catch them.

625
00:26:59,648 --> 00:27:01,812
When my granddaughter
falls asleep in my lap,

626
00:27:02,534 --> 00:27:06,458
I try to catch the feeling
of her breathing against me.

627
00:27:06,608 --> 00:27:09,134
And when I make my son laugh,

628
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:12,723
I try to catch the
sound of him laughing.

629
00:27:12,725 --> 00:27:15,158
How it rolls up from his chest.

630
00:27:18,894 --> 00:27:23,433
But the pieces are moving faster now,
and I can't catch them all.

631
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:26,834
I can feel them slipping
through my fingertips.

632
00:27:28,036 --> 00:27:30,814
And soon where there used to
be my granddaughter breathing

633
00:27:30,824 --> 00:27:34,313
and my son laughing, there will be...

634
00:27:34,718 --> 00:27:35,929
nothing.

635
00:27:39,788 --> 00:27:41,136
(quietly): Oh.

636
00:27:42,044 --> 00:27:45,430
I know it feels like you have
all the time in the world.

637
00:27:45,677 --> 00:27:47,841
But you don't.

638
00:27:48,217 --> 00:27:50,552
So, stop playing it so cool.

639
00:27:50,825 --> 00:27:53,159
Catch the moments of your life.

640
00:27:53,161 --> 00:27:56,579
Catch them while you're young and quick.

641
00:27:56,581 --> 00:27:59,415
Because sooner than you
know it, you'll be old.

642
00:28:00,124 --> 00:28:01,817
And slow.

643
00:28:02,259 --> 00:28:04,920
And there'll be no
more of them to catch.

644
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:11,527
And when a nice boy who
adores you offers you pie,

645
00:28:11,529 --> 00:28:13,125
say thank you.

646
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,900

By far the best Police Academy.

Hi.

657
00:29:15,576 --> 00:29:17,126
The name's Pilgrim Rick.

658
00:29:17,128 --> 00:29:20,095
I take it you come in search of lodging.

659
00:29:21,447 --> 00:29:23,866
You're doing a bit.
You're doing a bit...

660
00:29:23,868 --> 00:29:25,484
Uh, yeah.

661
00:29:25,486 --> 00:29:27,720
We're... we're in search of lodging.

662
00:29:28,371 --> 00:29:29,672
I needed a warm bed, too,

663
00:29:29,674 --> 00:29:32,875
when I finally made my
way off the Mayflower.

664
00:29:33,127 --> 00:29:35,528
Do you know about the
Mayflower, little kiddies?

665
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:38,330
Rebecca: Uh, yep. They do know all about

666
00:29:38,332 --> 00:29:40,090
- the Mayflower.
- Uh, we'll just... we'll take

667
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,684
your finest room, Rick.

668

00:29:51,811 --> 00:29:53,445
Be careful.

671
00:29:55,768 --> 00:29:56,925
Oh.

672
00:29:56,935 --> 00:29:58,908
(children groaning)

673
00:29:58,918 --> 00:30:01,403
Yeah, I got it, I got it.

674
00:30:02,101 --> 00:30:03,255
Is that real?

675
00:30:03,257 --> 00:30:05,241
No, of course not.

676
00:30:05,243 --> 00:30:07,243
Why is it so hot in here?

677
00:30:08,092 --> 00:30:11,247
Because the furnace is on high.

678
00:30:13,273 --> 00:30:16,029
The furnace is stuck on high, Jack.

679
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:18,237
Mom, can we take off our
dress clothes, please?

680
00:30:18,239 --> 00:30:20,750
Yes, yes, everybody can strip down.

681
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,108
- Yes.
- Hey, who, uh...

682
00:30:23,516 --> 00:30:26,478
who wants one of the most delicious

683
00:30:27,302 --> 00:30:29,798
gas station hot dogs

684
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:32,779
in the whole wide
Connecticut woods, huh?

685
00:30:35,383 --> 00:30:37,122
That's cold. Can't eat those.

686
00:30:37,124 --> 00:30:40,861
Or how 'bout instead some, uh,
Kraft Singles? Saltines? Yeah?

687
00:30:40,871 --> 00:30:44,471
Is this really what we're gonna
have for Thanksgiving dinner?

688
00:30:45,529 --> 00:30:47,270
This TV has zero channels.

689
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,830
I should have had my dad come to get us.

690
00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:53,806
Hey, you know what?
Um, get the kids settled.

691
00:30:53,808 --> 00:30:57,014
I'm gonna talk to Pilgrim Rick,
uh, about, uh...

692
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,166
about the furnace.
I'll... I'll be right back.

693
00:31:00,474 --> 00:31:03,123
Guys, really, I can't interest
you in cheese and crackers?

694
00:31:03,133 --> 00:31:05,017
Children: No.

695
00:31:13,844 --> 00:31:15,411
(chuckling)

696
00:31:17,214 --> 00:31:18,897
(humming softly)

697
00:31:23,833 --> 00:31:25,054
Hey.

698
00:31:25,056 --> 00:31:26,531
There we go.

699
00:31:27,091 --> 00:31:29,758
(humming)

700
00:31:52,023 --> 00:31:54,578
(screaming)

701
00:31:56,303 --> 00:31:58,937
(screaming continues)

702
00:32:02,876 --> 00:32:04,409
(screaming)

703
00:32:07,364 --> 00:32:10,705
(anxious chatter)

704
00:32:13,295 --> 00:32:14,808
(intercom dings) Pilot:
Sorry about that folks.

705
00:32:14,818 --> 00:32:17,272
Just some very fast moving cold front.

706
00:32:17,274 --> 00:32:19,307
Nothing to worry about. But please,

707
00:32:19,309 --> 00:32:22,727
remain in your seats with
your seatbelts fastened.

708
00:32:22,729 --> 00:32:24,410
(chuckles) Sorry,

709
00:32:24,524 --> 00:32:27,048
I thought I was gonna die.

710
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:29,868
(exhales) Me, too.

711
00:32:34,777 --> 00:32:38,009
I almost died married to a man
who's obviously cheating on me.

712
00:32:38,011 --> 00:32:40,328
My kids are out of the house now.

713
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:43,231
I have no reason to
stay with him anymore.

714
00:32:45,995 --> 00:32:48,036
I'm gonna get a divorce.

715
00:32:49,527 --> 00:32:51,351
Life's too short.

716
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:00,615
(knocking)

717
00:33:01,236 --> 00:33:02,522
Oh, that must be your dad.

718
00:33:02,532 --> 00:33:04,669
Kate: Dad has a key.

719
00:33:04,795 --> 00:33:06,284
Uh,

720
00:33:06,471 --> 00:33:08,669
- who is it?
- It's Pilgrim Rick!

721
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:09,973
Um,

722
00:33:09,983 --> 00:33:11,474
Pilgrim Rick, we're...

723
00:33:11,476 --> 00:33:13,482
- We're okay, actually.
- I'm here to fix the furnace!

724
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:15,015
Yeah, we're fine, Pilgrim Rick.

725
00:33:15,025 --> 00:33:16,863
- I'm coming in!
- (doorknob rattling)

726
00:33:16,865 --> 00:33:18,364
(gasping)

727
00:33:18,366 --> 00:33:19,482
Jack!

728
00:33:19,492 --> 00:33:22,251
(laughing)

729
00:33:22,253 --> 00:33:24,673
There's no Jack here, it's Pilgrim Rick.

730
00:33:24,683 --> 00:33:25,617
(Kate laughing)

731
00:33:25,627 --> 00:33:27,256
Do you kiddies know about the Mayflower?

732
00:33:27,258 --> 00:33:29,692
- (laughing)
- Huh? Huh?

733
00:33:29,702 --> 00:33:32,565
What if I told you a
little Thanksgiving story?

734
00:33:33,164 --> 00:33:34,497
How about a kiss for an old Pilgrim?

735
00:33:34,499 --> 00:33:35,748
- No... (shrieking)
- No, no,

736
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,100
no, no, no, mmm...

737
00:33:37,102 --> 00:33:38,735
Mwah!

738
00:33:38,737 --> 00:33:40,273
(all laughing)

739
00:33:40,283 --> 00:33:42,925
Tonight, on the itinerary...

740
00:33:42,935 --> 00:33:45,208
of the Pinewood Lodge,

741
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:47,276
a movie...

742
00:33:48,643 --> 00:33:50,501
and an indoor picnic.

743
00:33:50,511 --> 00:33:52,215
Kate: Yes!

744
00:33:52,858 --> 00:33:54,684
- Ooh.
- (laughing)

745
00:33:54,686 --> 00:33:56,069
Get the pillows!

746
00:33:56,071 --> 00:33:57,848
I found it in the office.

747
00:33:57,858 --> 00:33:59,190
- Police Academy III?
- Yeah.

748
00:33:59,192 --> 00:34:00,609
You sure that's appropriate?

749
00:34:00,611 --> 00:34:01,893
Ah, it was either that or 9 1/2 Weeks.

750
00:34:01,895 --> 00:34:02,911
- (gasps)
- So...

751
00:34:02,913 --> 00:34:05,897
- Police Academy III, guys! Yeah.
- So,

752
00:34:05,899 --> 00:34:08,095
we are going to...

753
00:34:08,105 --> 00:34:11,557
skewer our hotdogs

754
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:13,922
and then...

755
00:34:13,924 --> 00:34:15,740
we're gonna roast 'em...

756
00:34:19,677 --> 00:34:21,329
on an open furnace flame.

757
00:34:21,331 --> 00:34:23,815
And then once they get
all toasty and warm,

758
00:34:23,817 --> 00:34:25,650
we're gonna wrap it in cheese

759
00:34:25,652 --> 00:34:28,553
and then roll it in crushed up crackers.

760
00:34:28,555 --> 00:34:30,755
Thanksgiving cheese dogs.

761
00:34:30,757 --> 00:34:32,691
- Cool.
- Get a stick, come on.

762
00:34:32,693 --> 00:34:34,526
- All right, go.
- Yes!

763
00:34:34,528 --> 00:34:36,895
- I want a stick.
- Here you go, Pilgrim Rick.

764
00:34:36,897 --> 00:34:38,647
(chuckling) Thanks, buddy.

765
00:34:44,717 --> 00:34:46,388
Okay, who's up first?

766
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:47,704
Me.

767
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,911
And that's the kind
of dog you guys want?

768
00:34:52,913 --> 00:34:55,347
Oh, come on, guys.

769
00:34:55,349 --> 00:34:57,165
Somebody call for Pilgrim Rick?

770
00:34:57,167 --> 00:34:59,267
I'm sorry I'm late but,
uh, I had to make

771
00:34:59,269 --> 00:35:01,224
a little pit stop at the Mayflower.
Turns out Pilgrim Rick is

772
00:35:01,234 --> 00:35:03,304
lactose intolerant. Well, anyway,

773
00:35:03,306 --> 00:35:04,606
I'm here now and I'm looking for

774
00:35:04,608 --> 00:35:07,507
a couple of young little pilgrims...

775
00:35:07,612 --> 00:35:10,705
to... help me out with the, uh...

776
00:35:14,763 --> 00:35:17,682
uh, well the truth is, I am...
I'm actually not Pilgrim Rick.

777
00:35:17,692 --> 00:35:20,321
I'm Pilgrim Kevin. Uncle Kevin, really.

778
00:35:20,323 --> 00:35:21,973
Um...

779
00:35:21,975 --> 00:35:23,291
probably hard for you to tell, though.

780
00:35:23,293 --> 00:35:27,278
My acting has become so stellar,
all this stage acting.

781
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,892
Um, don't be sad though,
the-the real Pilgrim Rick is...

782
00:35:31,307 --> 00:35:33,324
Is right behind you.

783
00:35:36,036 --> 00:35:37,132
Come on.

784
00:35:37,142 --> 00:35:38,640
Uh, are you sure?

785
00:35:41,194 --> 00:35:42,177
Have fun.

786
00:35:42,179 --> 00:35:44,112
- Pilgrim Rick!
- Yay!

787
00:35:44,114 --> 00:35:46,197
It's me, Pilgrim Rick!

788
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:49,478
- (door opens)
- You kiddies know about the Mayflower?

789
00:35:49,488 --> 00:35:52,582
Let Pilgrim Rick tell you
a Thanksgiving story.

790
00:35:52,592 --> 00:35:54,197
In 1620...

791
00:35:54,207 --> 00:35:55,373
Find what you needed?

792
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:57,192
- Yeah.
- All right.

793
00:35:57,194 --> 00:35:59,160
Good. Uh, where's Kate?

794
00:36:01,091 --> 00:36:03,081
She, uh...

795
00:36:03,083 --> 00:36:05,850
texted, she'll... She'll be here soon.

796
00:36:05,852 --> 00:36:07,352
Okay.

797
00:36:07,354 --> 00:36:09,003
Everybody's starving,
you want to get started?

798
00:36:09,005 --> 00:36:10,398
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

799
00:36:10,408 --> 00:36:12,323
Hey, Pilgrim Rick. Can you
lead us into the dining room?

800
00:36:12,325 --> 00:36:14,876
- It's time for dinner.
- Miguel: Absolutely.

801
00:36:14,878 --> 00:36:16,611
Everybody, let's go put on a feast.

802
00:36:16,621 --> 00:36:18,329
(Beth laughing)

803
00:36:25,013 --> 00:36:27,163
What else can I help with?

804
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:29,285
(speaks quietly) Okay.

805
00:36:31,411 --> 00:36:32,750

Here, you do the honors.

817
00:36:58,483 --> 00:36:59,599
Thank you.

818
00:37:01,536 --> 00:37:03,511
(theme music playing)

819
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:05,723
This is probably the
greatest movie ever made.

820
00:37:05,733 --> 00:37:08,899
- Yeah?
- This sweater's so itchy.

821
00:37:08,909 --> 00:37:11,411
Here, let me have it.

822
00:37:14,849 --> 00:37:16,516
I have, uh...

823
00:37:16,518 --> 00:37:18,983
I have an idea for one more
Thanksgiving tradition

824
00:37:18,993 --> 00:37:21,404
before we go to bed. Come here.

825
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:22,772
What is it?

826
00:37:22,774 --> 00:37:24,540
So we're all gonna go around

827
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:26,078
and say what we're thankful for.

828
00:37:26,088 --> 00:37:28,361
And then whoever's turn it is,

829
00:37:28,363 --> 00:37:30,313
is going to pull on this yarn

830
00:37:30,315 --> 00:37:32,715
and then throw it to the next person.

831
00:37:32,725 --> 00:37:35,101
(laughing)

832
00:37:35,103 --> 00:37:36,719
Okay.

833
00:37:36,977 --> 00:37:39,374
I am thankful...

834
00:37:39,384 --> 00:37:40,977
for my family.

835
00:37:42,077 --> 00:37:46,062
I'm thankful that we're all safe.

836
00:37:46,064 --> 00:37:47,789
And...

837
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:50,266
there's no one in the world

838
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,632
I'd rather be too hot

839
00:37:52,642 --> 00:37:54,153
or too cold with.

840
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,861
I am thankful for my family.

841
00:38:02,663 --> 00:38:05,331
I am thankful that everyone's safe.

842
00:38:06,171 --> 00:38:09,827
And there is no one in the whole world

843
00:38:09,837 --> 00:38:11,904
I'd rather be too hot

844
00:38:11,906 --> 00:38:13,856
or too cold with.

845
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,648
Grandma always says the same thing.

846
00:38:16,736 --> 00:38:17,854
(chuckling)

847
00:38:17,864 --> 00:38:20,012
Yeah, she does, doesn't she?

848
00:38:30,053 --> 00:38:31,982
Is everything all right, baby?

849
00:38:35,162 --> 00:38:37,262
Um... you girls should
go upstairs and play

850
00:38:37,272 --> 00:38:38,648
in Tess's room for a little while.

851
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,416
- But...
- Come on.

852
00:38:56,052 --> 00:38:58,070
Why is there a photo of me

853
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:01,037
and a letter that you sent
to William's apartment?

854
00:39:12,417 --> 00:39:14,400
(exhales slowly)

855
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:17,003
- Randall...
- No, you know what?

856
00:39:17,005 --> 00:39:20,490
Don't... don't speak.
Please, don't just... um...

857
00:39:20,492 --> 00:39:21,891
I went to William's apartment

858
00:39:21,893 --> 00:39:24,260
to get his old Thanksgiving tapes.

859
00:39:24,722 --> 00:39:28,211
I was about to go and
I saw this envelope.

860
00:39:28,634 --> 00:39:29,894
I said,

861
00:39:31,238 --> 00:39:32,902
I know that handwriting.

862
00:39:32,904 --> 00:39:35,338
That's my mother's handwriting,
but how-how could that be?

863
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:37,123
That... it doesn't make sense, right?

864
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:39,624
- (paper rustling)
- So...

865
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:42,345
I, uh...

866
00:39:43,244 --> 00:39:44,881
"Dear William,

867
00:39:45,367 --> 00:39:47,683
I'm sorry I had to
leave in such a hurry.

868
00:39:48,263 --> 00:39:51,275
But it was wonderful to
see you looking so well

869
00:39:51,285 --> 00:39:54,557
after all these years."

870
00:39:57,495 --> 00:40:00,769
- After all these years.
- (sighs)

871
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:06,252
Randall, you have to understand...

872
00:40:06,262 --> 00:40:09,759
Understand what?
That you knew my father?

873
00:40:13,448 --> 00:40:17,230
That you kept him from
me my entire life?

874
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,787
- Everything that I...
- Just stop... Just stop!

875
00:40:21,797 --> 00:40:24,136
Please, stop.

876
00:40:26,691 --> 00:40:29,352
I can't... I can't even look at you.

877
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:32,495
(sniffles)

878
00:40:32,891 --> 00:40:37,079
And all the times I asked
you about my family.

879
00:40:37,089 --> 00:40:39,839
And if I hadn't found
him on my own, I'd....

880
00:40:43,584 --> 00:40:45,441
- I got to go.
- Beth: Wait.

881
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:46,928
(sniffles)

882
00:40:48,514 --> 00:40:49,912
Just wait a second, honey.

883
00:40:49,914 --> 00:40:51,517
- Please, babe.
- I just gotta get some time alone.

884
00:40:51,527 --> 00:40:53,432
- Excuse me.
- Hey...

885
00:40:53,434 --> 00:40:56,235
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm so late.

886
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:58,437
I have an announcement.

887
00:40:58,672 --> 00:41:01,694
I've decided to have
gastric bypass surgery.

888
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:09,165
Your family is amazing.

889
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:15,755
Randall: Mom?

890
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:18,174
Yeah, baby.

891
00:41:18,176 --> 00:41:20,543
I changed my mind.

892
00:41:20,545 --> 00:41:23,646
I want to have Thanksgiving
when I grow up.

893
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:24,730
You do?

894
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,100
Yeah.

895
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:29,502
I know how I want it to be.

896
00:41:29,871 --> 00:41:31,034
How?

897
00:41:31,756 --> 00:41:33,356
Like tonight.

898
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:35,491
I want every Thanksgiving

899
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:38,867
to be like this for the rest of my life.

900
00:41:42,438 --> 00:41:43,666
Mm.

901
