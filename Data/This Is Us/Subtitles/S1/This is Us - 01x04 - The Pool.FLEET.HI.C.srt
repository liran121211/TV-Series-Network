1
00:00:00,342 --> 00:00:01,387
Previously on This is us.

2
00:00:01,412 --> 00:00:03,482
I wanted to be the man
that made you happy.

3
00:00:03,507 --> 00:00:06,138
From here on out, I'm
gonna be a 12 for you.

4
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:08,240
You are getting in the car right now,

5
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:11,076
and we are going to
this doctors appointment.

6
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:12,911
Hi, white people.

7
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:15,080
I don't know what you were
looking for with all this,

8
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:17,282
but I do know you don't
have a whole lot of time.

9
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:19,451
I'd like to tell the girls who you are.

10
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:20,730
I was not a very good
brother to you, was I?

11
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:21,720
RANDALL: No, you weren't.

12
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:23,105
But you still got time.

13
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,659
- Toby.
- Kate. How's your breakfast?

14
00:00:24,684 --> 00:00:25,901
You mean this, uh,

15
00:00:25,925 --> 00:00:27,926
steel-cut oatmeal and egg-white pancake

16
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:29,595
you're making me eat? It's amazing.

17
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:31,897
I'm gonna do theater.

18
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:34,433
<i>I did it... I-I-I booked
a redeye to New York.</i>

19
00:00:36,392 --> 00:00:38,403
ANNOUNCER [on radio]: It's
a scorcher out there, folks.

20
00:00:38,427 --> 00:00:39,845
- Stay cool, Pittsburgh.
- RANDALL: Shut up.

21
00:00:39,853 --> 00:00:41,320
KEVIN: Don't tell me to shut up.

22
00:00:41,354 --> 00:00:42,398
- You're doing it wrong.
- No, I'm not.

23
00:00:42,422 --> 00:00:44,657
- Yes, you are.
- Mom, I'm hot.

24
00:00:44,691 --> 00:00:47,526
I know, kiddo. Dad is trying
to fix the air conditioning.

25
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,062
Babe, how's it going?
We're dying in here.

26
00:00:50,096 --> 00:00:52,097
- JACK: I'm working on it.
- Give it back!

27
00:00:52,132 --> 00:00:53,899
- Just hold on.
- Enough!

28
00:00:53,933 --> 00:00:55,434
Mom, Randall took my Rubik's Cube.

29
00:00:55,468 --> 00:00:57,569
- You weren't doing it right.
- Enough. Come here.

30
00:00:58,033 --> 00:01:00,033
Wow. You did this?

31
00:01:00,058 --> 00:01:02,041
You're supposed to be yelling at him!

32
00:01:02,075 --> 00:01:03,542
Randall, stop scratching.

33
00:01:03,576 --> 00:01:05,221
That's a rash, babe.
You're gonna make it worse.

34
00:01:05,245 --> 00:01:08,572
- JACK: Okay, I think I have a solution.
- Is it fixed?

35
00:01:08,597 --> 00:01:11,757
Jack, what... what are you doing wearing
that shirt? You know I hate that shirt.

36
00:01:11,809 --> 00:01:15,378
I'm wearing this shirt because
it makes me think of fun.

37
00:01:15,412 --> 00:01:17,046
It makes me think of sun.

38
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:21,817
And because we are
going to the pool! Huh?

39
00:01:21,851 --> 00:01:23,852
Kate Pearson, you get in here

40
00:01:23,887 --> 00:01:25,688
and you strut your stuff, young lady.

41
00:01:25,722 --> 00:01:27,495
That's right. Uh-huh. uh-huh.

42
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:30,238
- Care Bears.
- You know it, you know it.

43
00:01:30,263 --> 00:01:35,031
Today, people, we are gonna debut
the brand-new Care Bear bikini!

44
00:01:35,065 --> 00:01:36,866
Can we go to the Greenview pool?

45
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,235
The one with the diving board? <i>Please.</i>

46
00:01:39,269 --> 00:01:40,375
No, that place sucks.

47
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,312
- You barely get in anyway.
- [blows raspberry]

48
00:01:42,337 --> 00:01:45,712
The Big Three. Your brother needs you.

49
00:01:45,737 --> 00:01:47,120
- Come on, you big mope.
- [others repeating "please"]

50
00:01:47,144 --> 00:01:48,211
Don't hold out on us.

51
00:01:48,245 --> 00:01:49,712
Please. Please.

52
00:01:49,747 --> 00:01:51,759
Okay, okay, yes.

53
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:52,968
Go get your swimsuits
on. Go get your suits.

54
00:01:52,992 --> 00:01:54,736
Come on, towels, towels.

55
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,477
AC is zonked, babe, we're
gonna have to call someone.

56
00:01:56,501 --> 00:01:58,836
Pool, huh? Not a movie?

57
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,938
Are you sure you're
okay with the pool today.

58
00:02:00,972 --> 00:02:04,108
We're gonna have a
day-long pool vacation.

59
00:02:04,142 --> 00:02:05,676
I'm gonna snag us

60
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,811
not one, not two,

61
00:02:07,846 --> 00:02:10,536
- but five pool chairs.
- [gasps] Five?

62
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,127
I'm gonna snag us five pool chairs.

63
00:02:12,162 --> 00:02:14,663
- You bad man.
- Yes, I am.

64
00:02:14,697 --> 00:02:16,131
The kids are gonna run off,

65
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:19,100
you're gonna finish that book you've
been trying to read for two years.

66
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:21,055
- It's <i>Misery.</i>
- Oh, it's gonna be fun.

67
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,572
No, no, no, the book is
<i>Misery,</i> by Stephen King.

68
00:02:23,606 --> 00:02:25,074
Oh, yeah, right.

69
00:02:25,108 --> 00:02:26,809
Hey, I already packed the cooler.

70
00:02:26,843 --> 00:02:29,011
All soft drinks, no beer.

71
00:02:29,045 --> 00:02:31,480
A whole day at the pool
with those kids and no beer?

72
00:02:31,514 --> 00:02:32,815
I told you, I stopped drinking.

73
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:34,283
It's not you I'm worried about.

74
00:02:34,317 --> 00:02:36,618
[chuckles] See? That's
what we need, then.

75
00:02:36,653 --> 00:02:38,987
We just need a day to relax.

76
00:02:39,022 --> 00:02:40,656
[laughing]

77
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,791
[children screaming happily]

78
00:02:42,826 --> 00:02:44,993
WOMAN [over P.A.]: A
reminder, there is no running,

79
00:02:45,028 --> 00:02:48,664
no diving, and absolutely no
glass containers in the pool area.

80
00:02:48,698 --> 00:02:51,300
Feeling relaxed yet?

81
00:02:51,334 --> 00:02:53,669
[shouts, laughter]

82
00:02:55,614 --> 00:02:57,573
There's a chair!

83
00:02:59,008 --> 00:02:59,975
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

84
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:01,710
Go get it! Get it, yes!

85
00:03:01,744 --> 00:03:03,512
- Get it, get it, get it.
- Yeah!

86
00:03:03,555 --> 00:03:05,220
Ow.

87
00:03:05,228 --> 00:03:07,029
Oh, stop it. That doesn't hurt.

88
00:03:07,063 --> 00:03:08,541
- Ow!
- RANDALL: Oh, that one might've hurt.

89
00:03:08,565 --> 00:03:10,366
Sorry. Gotcha.

90
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,444
ANNIE: I want Grandpa to do mine.

91
00:03:11,468 --> 00:03:13,369
WILLIAM: No problem, Miss Annie.

92
00:03:13,403 --> 00:03:16,105
Oh, really? You want Grandpa
to try to tame this mess?

93
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:18,374
- Have at it.
- Let's see here.

94
00:03:18,408 --> 00:03:20,676
Oh, that's gotta go. Beth,
where's your scissors?

95
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,311
- No!
- [William laughing]

96
00:03:22,345 --> 00:03:25,314
Then you better sit still
and not give me a hard time.

97
00:03:25,348 --> 00:03:27,316
How'd you get that scar?

98
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:29,876
Oh, that? Rock, bottle...

99
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:31,482
Eh, there were plenty
in the air that day.

100
00:03:31,506 --> 00:03:34,700
- Maybe we don't tell that story.
- Oh, no, it's not a bad one.

101
00:03:34,763 --> 00:03:36,691
Some people in Pittsburgh
were fighting against bussing,

102
00:03:36,715 --> 00:03:38,499
and I was helping out with that.

103
00:03:38,533 --> 00:03:40,000
'86, '87?

104
00:03:40,034 --> 00:03:41,301
ANNIE: What's bussing?

105
00:03:41,336 --> 00:03:44,271
Getting poor children into the
schools in better neighborhoods.

106
00:03:44,305 --> 00:03:45,272
You were working with the Urban League?

107
00:03:45,306 --> 00:03:47,207
Yeah, a little bit, yeah.

108
00:03:49,144 --> 00:03:50,644
Look, I gotta get on my walk.

109
00:03:50,678 --> 00:03:52,112
You wanna take over here?

110
00:03:52,147 --> 00:03:53,553
- Mm-hmm.
- Mwah!

111
00:03:54,648 --> 00:03:56,817
Okay, you two, let's get moving.

112
00:03:56,851 --> 00:03:58,285
Mom and I gotta get to work

113
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,987
so we can pay for all this hair product.

114
00:04:00,021 --> 00:04:01,321
- [Annie laughs]
- [FaceTime rings]

115
00:04:05,015 --> 00:04:06,493
Hey, hey!

116
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,128
- <i>The Eagle has landed.</i>
- RANDALL: What's up?

117
00:04:08,163 --> 00:04:11,265
I'm officially a New
Yorker now... East Coast!

118
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:13,000
Hey, somebody wants to say hi.

119
00:04:13,034 --> 00:04:14,953
Uncle Kevin, come see my play.

120
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,067
I'm Snow White.

121
00:04:16,101 --> 00:04:17,568
You're kidding me!

122
00:04:17,603 --> 00:04:19,247
Snow White's my favorite
character of all time!

123
00:04:19,271 --> 00:04:21,072
I'm actually auditioning
for a play, too.

124
00:04:21,106 --> 00:04:23,174
Yeah, it's very dark,
very, very truthful...

125
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:25,373
- Do the Manny voice.
- What's that?

126
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:26,855
They love it when you
do the catchphrase.

127
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:28,913
I don't want to do the Manny voice.

128
00:04:28,947 --> 00:04:30,348
- Please.
- Please.

129
00:04:30,382 --> 00:04:33,084
- Baby say what?
- Like, for real.

130
00:04:33,118 --> 00:04:34,252
[grumbles, sighs]

131
00:04:34,571 --> 00:04:35,671
Baby say what?

132
00:04:35,705 --> 00:04:37,239
No, like in the show.

133
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,343
[in character]: Baby say <i>what?</i>

134
00:04:41,377 --> 00:04:44,539
[girls laughing]

135
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,484
Your biggest fans.

136
00:04:46,509 --> 00:04:50,309
Any... anyway, this play is a
total departure for me, you know?

137
00:04:50,334 --> 00:04:54,652
None of that, like, Manny stuff. It's
a character-driven departure for me.

138
00:04:55,108 --> 00:04:56,988
Where'd you go? What are you looking at?

139
00:04:57,022 --> 00:04:59,037
Uh, hey, man, uh, I gotta go.

140
00:05:00,631 --> 00:05:02,266
You're just gonna hang up on him?

141
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:05,096
No, no, no, I will not show you my I.D.

142
00:05:05,131 --> 00:05:07,432
Not until you tell me why
you need a reason to see it.

143
00:05:07,466 --> 00:05:09,934
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Tony,
what's going on here?

144
00:05:09,969 --> 00:05:11,958
Hey, Mr. Pearson. We had a
report of someone loitering.

145
00:05:11,982 --> 00:05:13,638
I wasn't loitering.

146
00:05:13,672 --> 00:05:16,908
I was taking my walk, and literally
on my way to smell the roses,

147
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:18,943
- as I have been for the past week.
- I know.

148
00:05:18,978 --> 00:05:20,812
Is there some local
rose smelling ordinance

149
00:05:20,846 --> 00:05:22,157
- I'm not aware of?
- William, enough.

150
00:05:22,181 --> 00:05:23,314
Enough...

151
00:05:23,349 --> 00:05:24,616
He's with you, sir?

152
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,284
Yeah, he's staying with us.

153
00:05:26,318 --> 00:05:28,849
- Sorry.
- Sorry? [scoffs]

154
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,123
WOMAN: We're so sorry.

155
00:05:32,158 --> 00:05:33,776
We didn't know, Randall.

156
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:35,460
Understood. Thanks.

157
00:05:35,494 --> 00:05:36,828
Thank you, Tony.

158
00:05:41,144 --> 00:05:43,290
We're gonna get you some new clothes.

159
00:05:47,728 --> 00:05:48,728
I hate kale.

160
00:05:48,762 --> 00:05:50,396
Me, too.

161
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,782
Ick.

162
00:05:52,766 --> 00:05:56,068
Baby arugula is just as
bad as grown-up arugula.

163
00:05:57,111 --> 00:05:58,545
All right, you know what?

164
00:05:59,881 --> 00:06:01,181
Here we go.

165
00:06:01,216 --> 00:06:03,120
Oh, no, no, no. Let me get...

166
00:06:03,145 --> 00:06:05,185
Remember, you are unemployed.

167
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,020
And I am not convinced
that you would do well

168
00:06:07,055 --> 00:06:09,189
- begging for money.
- Are you kidding?

169
00:06:09,224 --> 00:06:10,701
You don't think the drivers
will be sympathetic to me

170
00:06:10,725 --> 00:06:12,203
holding up a sign that says "hungry?"

171
00:06:12,227 --> 00:06:13,927
That's good.

172
00:06:13,962 --> 00:06:16,497
I'm gonna use the restroom,
and then we'll go, okay?

00:06:29,369 --> 00:06:32,163
- Uh, good. How are you?
- Good.

177
00:06:37,886 --> 00:06:40,854
Okay, uh... you wanna get out of here?

178
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:43,524
- Who was that?
- Who was... uh...

179
00:06:43,558 --> 00:06:46,426
You saw that. Uh, that was my ex-wife.

180
00:06:46,461 --> 00:06:49,229
[laughing]

181
00:06:52,634 --> 00:06:53,822
Wait, are you serious?

182
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:56,270
Uh, yeah. I told you
I was married before.

183
00:06:59,396 --> 00:07:00,674
Not to that.

Hey, Kate, stop being silly.
Come over here, please.

Oh, Samantha and Vicki are here!

00:07:27,804 --> 00:07:30,105
- Care Bears!
- JACK: Okay, that's two.

00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,751
Babe, I had to sleep with
someone to get this one.

191
00:07:31,775 --> 00:07:33,419
- I hope that's okay.
- Yeah, I'm fine with it.

00:07:33,443 --> 00:07:34,977
As long as his wife is okay with it.

Kevin, you're up, please. Shirt off.

194
00:07:37,013 --> 00:07:38,314
Why? I don't even like swimming.

195
00:07:38,348 --> 00:07:40,249
You don't have to put your face in.

196
00:07:40,283 --> 00:07:42,428
You can sit in the shallow end
and Randall will stay with you.

197
00:07:42,452 --> 00:07:43,619
I don't like Randall either.

- REBECCA: Enough.

199
00:07:44,688 --> 00:07:45,955
Turn around.

200
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:48,884
Randall, you're up, please.

201
00:07:50,293 --> 00:07:52,461
Come here.

202
00:07:52,496 --> 00:07:54,630
Turn around, please.

203
00:07:54,664 --> 00:07:56,799
Are you sure I really need sunscreen?

204
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,312
- Yes, absolutely.
- Yeah, absolutely.

205
00:07:59,336 --> 00:08:01,626
- Of course you do. Sure.

Okay, look, Big Three, come here.

207

Come here. You are surrounded by adults

208
00:08:05,227 --> 00:08:07,265
and lifeguards that resemble adults.

209
00:08:07,313 --> 00:08:08,958
There's very little trouble
you can actually get into...

210
00:08:08,982 --> 00:08:10,716
Wait, wait. Kate, baby,

211
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,751
are you sure you don't
want to put a shirt on?

212
00:08:12,785 --> 00:08:14,886
- Right.
- Here.

213
00:08:14,921 --> 00:08:16,755
Enjoy your <i>Misery.</i>

00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:18,801
People are staring at her
in that bathing suit, Jack.

215
00:08:18,825 --> 00:08:21,059
Some jerky little kid
is gonna say something.

216
00:08:21,094 --> 00:08:22,961
It's baby fat.

217
00:08:22,996 --> 00:08:25,731
She's only eight years old.
Kids haven't turned mean yet.

218
00:08:25,765 --> 00:08:28,567
And what is up with Kevin
lately, and that attitude?

219
00:08:28,601 --> 00:08:30,569
- He's so jealous of Randall.
- He's fine.

220
00:08:30,603 --> 00:08:32,104
Babe, he's fine.

221
00:08:32,138 --> 00:08:34,061
They are all fine.

222
00:08:34,085 --> 00:08:35,752
And does Randall need sunscreen?

223
00:08:35,786 --> 00:08:38,388
I mean, have we just been wasting
sunscreen all of these years?

224
00:08:38,422 --> 00:08:40,090
That I have no answer for.

225
00:08:40,827 --> 00:08:42,459
Chair. Chair!

226
00:08:42,493 --> 00:08:43,889
Careful!

227
00:08:45,941 --> 00:08:47,931
KEVIN: <i>She's his ex-wife, Kate.</i>

228
00:08:47,965 --> 00:08:49,733
All right? The operative
word being "ex."

229
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:51,426
They're not together
anymore. He's with you now.

230
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:53,903
"Why?" is the question.
You should see her.

231
00:08:53,938 --> 00:08:55,605
Maybe that's what Toby wants.

232
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:57,741
Maybe he's fulfilling a
fat-girl fetish with me.

233
00:08:57,775 --> 00:08:58,742
Well, that's actually a thing.

234
00:08:58,776 --> 00:09:01,254
Of course, for me it was more of
a phase than a thing, but anyway...

235
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:02,912
I did a deep dive with this woman.

236
00:09:02,947 --> 00:09:04,414
Everything reeks fabulous.

237
00:09:04,448 --> 00:09:06,983
She has fabulous taste,
she has fabulous friends.

238
00:09:07,017 --> 00:09:09,148
She's been to Argentina, Kevin!

239
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:12,789
Listen to me, I did not leave you in Los
Angeles so you could selfsabotage, okay?

240
00:09:12,823 --> 00:09:14,924
So get off the Internet...
do that right now...

241
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,393
and tell me how hard I'm
gonna crush this audition.

242
00:09:17,428 --> 00:09:19,952
The edges are gone...

243
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:21,851
and then the thing.

DIRECTOR: Thank you, Sean Patrick.

245
00:09:26,796 --> 00:09:30,306
- Some good choices, I thought.
- It's Daniel. Everyone else sucks.

246
00:09:30,341 --> 00:09:32,809
- WOMAN: You know, I kind of liked...
- It's Daniel.

247
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,685
Hold on, hold on.

248
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:38,057
We have one more. Kevin Pearson.

249
00:09:38,097 --> 00:09:40,510
Sorry. I know, I know. I'm
sorry. I'm sorry I'm late.

250
00:09:40,535 --> 00:09:42,614
It's just, you know, I tried
to take the subway, right,

251
00:09:42,638 --> 00:09:43,949
and then walk, like a New Yorker.

252
00:09:43,973 --> 00:09:46,140
Uh, Ron Shiller.

253
00:09:46,175 --> 00:09:48,076
This is Sloane Sandberg.

254
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:50,778
- You're the, uh, screenwriter.
- Playwright.

255
00:09:50,813 --> 00:09:53,432
Well, you know, I mean,
you gotta start somewhere.

256
00:09:53,457 --> 00:09:57,239
Um, you'll be reading with Miss
Maine today, if that's okay.

257
00:09:57,271 --> 00:09:59,639
Yeah, no, whatever you got,
you know. Miss Maine, Miss Iowa.

258
00:09:59,674 --> 00:10:01,575
I judged, uh, Miss USA for Trump once,

259
00:10:01,609 --> 00:10:03,410
so we may have actually met before.

260
00:10:03,444 --> 00:10:05,979
Miss Maine is Olivia Maine.

261
00:10:06,466 --> 00:10:08,201

SHILLER: She plays Jessica.

263
00:10:10,785 --> 00:10:13,878
Of course. Hi. Good to meet you.

264
00:10:16,591 --> 00:10:18,558
Uh, well, before we
start, I just wanted to...

265
00:10:18,593 --> 00:10:20,550
I want to get something off my chest.

266
00:10:20,575 --> 00:10:22,106
I do understand the
perception, you know.

267
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:23,607
These L.A. actors, they
come out here, right?

268
00:10:23,631 --> 00:10:26,066
They do their little
quick stint in theater

269
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,244
just to feel better about themselves.

270
00:10:27,268 --> 00:10:30,103
That's not why I'm here, okay?
I'm here for the right reasons.

271
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,775
Let's get this over with, shall we?

272
00:10:35,539 --> 00:10:37,974
[sniffles, clears throat]

273
00:10:46,527 --> 00:10:47,821
Did you want me to start?

274
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,689
Yes, I thought it
would be good, if, uh...

275
00:10:49,724 --> 00:10:52,581
you speak, then I speak, then
you speak, and we all go home.

276
00:10:52,606 --> 00:10:54,795
Does that work for you?

277
00:10:54,829 --> 00:10:56,329
Yeah. That's great...

278
00:10:58,353 --> 00:11:00,187
[clears throat]

279
00:11:03,905 --> 00:11:06,305
My recollection's hazy,
actually, it was a long day.

280
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:09,810
Not for me. Mine was over
before 9:00 in the morning.

281
00:11:09,844 --> 00:11:11,912
[whispering]: That's
really good... accent.

282
00:11:11,953 --> 00:11:13,754
- What?
- The American accent.

283
00:11:13,781 --> 00:11:15,081
What?

284
00:11:15,979 --> 00:11:18,351
I just... diving...
diving right back in. Uh...

285
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,387
[flipping pages]

286
00:11:21,989 --> 00:11:24,157
It say, uh... it says
"I lay," uh, I don't...

287
00:11:24,192 --> 00:11:25,893
Let me just say... I don't
need to say it. It says...

288
00:11:25,917 --> 00:11:27,217
I'll just say it.

289
00:11:27,283 --> 00:11:28,962
I lay...

290
00:11:29,184 --> 00:11:31,085
Just keep going.

291
00:11:31,121 --> 00:11:33,088
[chuckles softly] This is...

292
00:11:33,123 --> 00:11:34,957
I'll get it. [sniffles]

293
00:11:34,991 --> 00:11:37,306
I lay on the dock all night,

294
00:11:37,331 --> 00:11:39,260
and part of the next morning.

295
00:11:39,296 --> 00:11:40,876
And I don't feel a thing.

296
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:44,595
Let me take that again.

297
00:11:44,923 --> 00:11:46,935
KEVIN: Oh, my gosh... oh, my gosh.

298
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:49,605
Okay. Baby say what... [chuckles]

299
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:53,375
Okay. I-I lay... Let me get into it.

300
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:56,420
I lay on the dock all night
and part of the next morning.

301
00:11:56,445 --> 00:11:58,404
And I don't feel a thing.

302
00:11:58,429 --> 00:12:02,017
The bug bites, the sunburn. Nothin'.

303
00:12:02,052 --> 00:12:04,420
It's like when we used to
go fishing. You remember?

304
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,248
- I never fished...
- Do you have the next...

305
00:12:12,272 --> 00:12:13,638
- What the hell?
- Sorry.

306
00:12:14,286 --> 00:12:15,726
You weren't talking, so I thought...

307
00:12:16,404 --> 00:12:18,177
- It's called a pause.
- Right.

308
00:12:21,316 --> 00:12:22,895
Sorry. It doesn't say
pause on my script...

309
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:25,805
Well, it doesn't say suck,
either, yet here we are.

310
00:12:28,599 --> 00:12:30,299
RANDALL: You know your size?

311
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:31,934
Always tended toward the slim.

312
00:12:31,969 --> 00:12:34,317
I don't see that changing
much at this point.

313
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:40,392
Try these.

314
00:12:40,417 --> 00:12:42,078
Afterwards, we'll swing by the pharmacy,

315
00:12:42,112 --> 00:12:44,914
get those medications that
the doctor wrote for you.

316
00:12:44,948 --> 00:12:46,749
Sounds like a plan.

317
00:12:46,783 --> 00:12:49,085
Ugh! $100?

318
00:12:49,119 --> 00:12:51,120
It's what they cost.

319
00:12:51,154 --> 00:12:54,357
I'm paying, just take the pants.

320
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,833
So are we gonna talk about it or not?

321
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:05,167
Talk about what?

322
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:07,709
Ha. About what. Uh, this morning.

323
00:13:07,734 --> 00:13:11,574
Or are you content to stand in
silent judgment with that face?

324
00:13:11,608 --> 00:13:12,686
It's just my face.

325
00:13:12,711 --> 00:13:15,745
No, you didn't like
me apologizing for you.

326
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:17,139
I get it.

327
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:19,154
Would you have been happier
if I made a big scene?

328
00:13:19,186 --> 00:13:20,720
You know, got up in Tony's face,

329
00:13:20,745 --> 00:13:23,319
had the cops roll up
and turn the hoses on us?

330
00:13:23,353 --> 00:13:24,752
It's the Cosgroves.

331
00:13:24,777 --> 00:13:27,944
He runs an insurance
agency, she collects owls.

332
00:13:27,968 --> 00:13:30,437
History would not have
memorialized our stand.

333
00:13:30,468 --> 00:13:31,779
You ever had a hose turned on you?

334
00:13:31,803 --> 00:13:33,280
Can't say that I have, I'm very sorry.

335
00:13:33,304 --> 00:13:35,439
Don't be. It hurts.

336
00:13:35,473 --> 00:13:37,107
And there's that face.

337
00:13:37,141 --> 00:13:39,142
Only face I got. Look,
I could use some socks...

338
00:13:39,177 --> 00:13:41,411
No, the face. The one
that says I have a scar

339
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:43,480
on my arm from integrating schools.

340
00:13:43,514 --> 00:13:46,596
And probably blisters on your
feet from marching for freedom,

341
00:13:46,631 --> 00:13:49,159
but me, because I grew
up in a white house,

342
00:13:49,184 --> 00:13:51,520
you think I don't live
in a black man's world.

343
00:13:51,614 --> 00:13:52,923

00:30:18,611 --> 00:30:22,681
and... I came across this man...

689
00:30:22,715 --> 00:30:23,915
a traveler.

690
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:27,793
He was wearing ragged clothes and
he had a strange way of talking.

691
00:30:27,818 --> 00:30:31,722
And these three young
jerks were bothering him.

692
00:30:32,677 --> 00:30:35,646
They were trying to take
away his bag of groceries.

693
00:30:35,671 --> 00:30:37,505
And so... I chased the jerks off.

694
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:40,690
- By yourself?
- Yeah, by myself.

695
00:30:40,715 --> 00:30:42,503
And I had a few...

696
00:30:43,136 --> 00:30:46,464
vitamin drinks and... I chased them off.

697
00:30:46,489 --> 00:30:49,710
It happened. And the
traveler was so grateful,

698
00:30:49,735 --> 00:30:51,093
he wanted to repay me.

699
00:30:51,101 --> 00:30:53,002
You know, he-he didn't have much,

700
00:30:53,037 --> 00:30:55,071
so he reaches into his little satchel

701
00:30:55,105 --> 00:30:58,041
and he pulls out this shirt.

702
00:30:58,075 --> 00:31:02,045
He says to me that it's a magic T-shirt.

703
00:31:02,528 --> 00:31:06,049
He said, that when you wear it,

704
00:31:06,083 --> 00:31:10,053
your enemies will see you
exactly as you want to be seen,

705
00:31:10,087 --> 00:31:11,721
and only that way.

706
00:31:11,755 --> 00:31:14,557
Whether it's a... a warrior,

707
00:31:14,592 --> 00:31:17,300
or a princess. Whatever you want.

708
00:31:17,325 --> 00:31:19,128
- Does it work?
- You tell me.

709
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:22,862
I was wearing this shirt
the night I met your mom.

710
00:31:22,887 --> 00:31:26,102
And she thought I was the
handsomest man in the world.

711
00:31:26,136 --> 00:31:27,511
- You?
- Yeah, I know.

712
00:31:27,536 --> 00:31:28,959
Me.

713
00:31:30,503 --> 00:31:31,703
Magic.

714
00:31:40,914 --> 00:31:43,248
I'm gonna go with princess.

715
00:31:50,327 --> 00:31:52,562
I want you to know...

716
00:31:52,596 --> 00:31:55,140
that your daddy already sees you
that way without the shirt, okay?

717
00:31:55,164 --> 00:31:56,599
You don't need it.

718
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:00,608
Thanks, Daddy, but I'm
gonna wear it anyway.

719
00:32:05,262 --> 00:32:06,692
Okay.

720
00:32:08,194 --> 00:32:09,494
Your Highness.

721
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:12,324
Need to find you a crown.

722
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,174
Oh, my God, this is not happening.

723
00:32:21,225 --> 00:32:23,998
This is... are you... oh. [laughs]

724
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:27,619
- Toby.
- Oh...

725
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:32,638
So you're telling me that
you work for my ex-wife?

726
00:32:32,663 --> 00:32:34,793
I didn't mean to,
okay? It just happened.

727
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:36,662
Like, I-I wanted to see her up close.

728
00:32:36,696 --> 00:32:39,926
So you... just stalked
her like a serial killer.

729
00:32:39,951 --> 00:32:41,949
Josie and I prefer
to call it "research."

730
00:32:41,974 --> 00:32:44,324
"Josie and I." "Josie and I"?

731
00:32:44,349 --> 00:32:46,606
Wha... how in the hell
is there a Josie and I?

732
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:49,242
- I don't know. I just had to know.
- Know what?

733
00:32:49,276 --> 00:32:52,445
Toby, one of these things
is not like the other, okay?

734
00:32:52,478 --> 00:32:55,747
So I wondered, like was she
fat and then she got skinny?

735
00:32:55,782 --> 00:32:57,549
Was she a terrible person? But no.

736
00:32:57,584 --> 00:32:59,384
She's actually beautiful,
and she's great,

737
00:32:59,419 --> 00:33:01,053
and she thinks that I'm great,

738
00:33:01,087 --> 00:33:02,598
and she has amazing
taste in imported goods.

739
00:33:02,622 --> 00:33:04,456
Like, feel this.

740
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:06,258
[stammering]: I don't
even know what that is!

741
00:33:06,292 --> 00:33:07,559
It's a portfolio.

742
00:33:07,594 --> 00:33:09,227
- Oh.
- And I liked it.

743
00:33:09,262 --> 00:33:11,009
Is that what you want?

744
00:33:11,034 --> 00:33:13,008
Is that what you want? Do
you want a skinny person?

745
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:16,034
No, but I would like to be
with a sane person, Kate.

746
00:33:18,021 --> 00:33:19,304
That is not nice.

747
00:33:19,339 --> 00:33:21,506
Yeah, well, maybe I'm a
little tired of being nice.

748
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:23,008
Some stranger

749
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:24,787
tells you that you're
great and you believe her.

750
00:33:24,811 --> 00:33:26,522
I tell you you're great
and you think I'm lying.

751
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:27,617
Why is that?

752
00:33:27,642 --> 00:33:29,687
I don't... I don't
know. I have a problem.

753
00:33:29,712 --> 00:33:31,316
We all have problems, Kate.

754
00:33:31,351 --> 00:33:34,953
- Toby, all of my life...
- You've been fat.

755
00:33:34,988 --> 00:33:36,688
Yeah, I get it.

756
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:39,191
I empathize, clearly.

757
00:33:39,216 --> 00:33:43,738
I empathize, then I say something cute,
then you feel better, rinse and repeat.

758
00:33:45,261 --> 00:33:47,265
She was terrible to me, Kate.

759
00:33:48,058 --> 00:33:49,465
Josie,

760
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:52,938
this skinny, successful woman

761
00:33:52,972 --> 00:33:55,121
that-that you admire so much?

762
00:33:55,146 --> 00:33:57,509
She cheated on me, she lied to me,

763
00:33:57,543 --> 00:33:59,761
and then she took half my life savings.

764
00:33:59,786 --> 00:34:04,722
I gained 95 pounds in one
year after she left me.

765
00:34:06,019 --> 00:34:08,074
At my lowest point, I told my brother

766
00:34:08,122 --> 00:34:10,628
that I was committing suicide
even though that wasn't true

767
00:34:10,653 --> 00:34:13,738
because I wanted him to be
as scared and lonely as I was.

768
00:34:13,763 --> 00:34:15,761
You know what? You know what? That's...

769
00:34:16,892 --> 00:34:19,260
that's a lie, I, uh...

770
00:34:21,764 --> 00:34:23,565
I did consider suicide.

771
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,147
A lot.

772
00:34:26,178 --> 00:34:28,334
When I would get drunk.

773
00:34:29,006 --> 00:34:33,219
Alone. And disgust myself.

774
00:34:35,789 --> 00:34:39,047
So, you haven't cornered
the market on problems, Kate.

775
00:34:43,232 --> 00:34:45,220
God, I'm really sorry.

776
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:52,890
My issues are not gonna
go away overnight, Toby.

777
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:55,006
Well...

778
00:34:56,724 --> 00:34:58,028
neither am I.

779
00:34:58,953 --> 00:35:01,321
But Jesus, Kate...

780
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:09,072
Josie and I

781
00:35:09,532 --> 00:35:11,548
weren't good together.

782
00:35:13,058 --> 00:35:14,726
So we're not.

783
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:19,665
It's not like I was
gonna keep the job anyway.

784
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:21,752
But you know who are good together?

785
00:35:23,993 --> 00:35:26,064
Matt Lauer and Savannah Guthrie?

786
00:35:26,089 --> 00:35:27,806
[quietly]: Yeah, duh.

787
00:35:27,861 --> 00:35:29,061
I love them.

788
00:35:29,096 --> 00:35:30,578
And I want them to be my family.

789
00:35:30,603 --> 00:35:32,231
And also us.

We're pretty good together.

about Matt and Savannah.

- Oh, my God, you're killing me.

Because I'm in no position
to judge you whatsoever.

But you need to know, if I
was in a position to judge you,

Because you know what this
little black kid was doing?

821

Which is pretty much the

824
00:37:30,264 --> 00:37:32,639
I had this little notebook...

825
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:36,239
and every time I met a new black person,

826
00:37:36,264 --> 00:37:39,522
I would put a mark in this notebook.

827
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:44,535
And every time I met a black
man, I wondered if, somehow,

828
00:37:45,416 --> 00:37:47,715
if that man could possibly be my father.

829
00:37:47,751 --> 00:37:49,786
But I couldn't say that.

830
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,891
You know, I couldn't say it out loud

831

to how we raise our girls, believe that.

837

- Yes.
- The fact that my daughter

838
00:38:16,309 --> 00:38:19,041
doesn't find anything unusual
about her playing Snow White?

839
00:38:20,315 --> 00:38:22,612
