00:00:00,106 --> 00:00:01,551
Previously on "This Is Us"...

2
00:00:01,561 --> 00:00:03,012
- Toby.
- Kate.

3
00:00:03,022 --> 00:00:04,831
I can't fall for a fat person right now.

4
00:00:04,841 --> 00:00:07,308
It's always gonna be about
the weight for me, Toby.

5
00:00:07,318 --> 00:00:09,593
I'm done dieting, okay?

6
00:00:14,466 --> 00:00:15,783
Wait.

7
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,970
William: I wonder if I could
check on him from time to time.

8
00:00:19,972 --> 00:00:21,008
No.

9
00:00:21,018 --> 00:00:23,334
Hey, Mom! Hey, Miguel.

10
00:00:23,344 --> 00:00:25,026
I'm Rebecca. I'm Randall's mother.

11
00:00:25,028 --> 00:00:26,427
Very nice to meet you.

12
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:28,312
Uh, nice to meet you as well.

13
00:00:28,314 --> 00:00:32,283
Beth: It's in the book of poems that
Randall's had since he was a baby.

14
00:00:32,285 --> 00:00:34,635
The one I gave Rebecca back in the day.

15
00:00:34,637 --> 00:00:37,354
Beth: Rebecca, this is Beth.
Yeah, um, so William just told me

16
00:00:37,356 --> 00:00:39,256
something really interesting.

17
00:00:39,258 --> 00:00:41,163

- Get away, Shredder.
- Boys.

28
00:01:19,844 --> 00:01:21,898
I just ironed those shirts.

29
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,452
No roughhousing until we get
to Grandma and Grandpa's.

30
00:01:25,462 --> 00:01:27,628
And no roughhousing when we get
to Grandma and Grandpa's, either.

31
00:01:27,638 --> 00:01:30,724
I want you to just sit there
quietly, okay? Maybe mention

32
00:01:30,726 --> 00:01:33,193
what a good mom I am if it comes
up naturally in conversation.

33
00:01:33,195 --> 00:01:36,780
Kate: I hate this stupid
sweater. It's so itchy.

34
00:01:36,782 --> 00:01:39,850
I know, baby doll,
but Grandma knit it just for you.

35
00:01:39,852 --> 00:01:41,843
She didn't do a really good job.

36
00:01:41,853 --> 00:01:43,904
Randall: I hate going
to Grandma and Grandpa's.

37
00:01:43,906 --> 00:01:46,171
Whenever we take pictures,
they always say,

38
00:01:46,181 --> 00:01:49,072
"Okay, okay, now one
with just the twins."

39
00:01:49,082 --> 00:01:52,100
I will talk to them about that. Again.

40
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:56,066
Jack: Okay, get excited, people.
Annual Thanksgiving road trip.

41
00:01:56,068 --> 00:01:58,000
I've got snacks.

42
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:59,753
I got Cool Ranch.

43
00:01:59,755 --> 00:02:01,738
I've got Paul Simon.

44
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,239
- Now everyone, go pee.
- We already peed.

45
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:06,410
Go pee again,
six-hour road trip, come on.

46
00:02:06,412 --> 00:02:08,845
- Go, go, go. Go, go, go.
- But... but we already went.

47
00:02:08,847 --> 00:02:11,765
Don't get anything
on your chinos, please.

48
00:02:11,767 --> 00:02:14,815
Do you hear me?
They inherited your aim, Jack.

49
00:02:15,608 --> 00:02:17,701
(laughs) Hey, cranberry looks great.

50
00:02:17,711 --> 00:02:20,223
I know. Great is not good enough,
it has to be perfect.

51
00:02:20,225 --> 00:02:22,671
Because my sister's sweet
potato pie is gonna be perfect,

52
00:02:22,681 --> 00:02:25,595
and I can't stand to hear my
mother's passive-aggressive BS

53
00:02:25,597 --> 00:02:27,464
if my sauce is not absolutely perfect.

54
00:02:27,466 --> 00:02:30,203
Perfect. Babe, it is perfect.

55
00:02:30,213 --> 00:02:32,352
It is, it's perfect.
Or, as your mother would say,

56
00:02:32,354 --> 00:02:33,770
"Becky, it's to die for." (gasps)

57
00:02:33,772 --> 00:02:35,900
- Can I have the nutmeg, please?
- Oh. Yeah.

58
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:38,582
I'm sorry. I know this is not a fun way

59
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:40,427
- to spend the holiday.
- Not fun? Are you kidding me?

60
00:02:40,429 --> 00:02:42,030
Listening to your sister's husband brag

61
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,031
about his expensive CD
player for three hours

62
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:46,647
is the definition of fun.

63
00:02:46,657 --> 00:02:48,180
So, always thought that,

64
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:51,304
when my folks die, we get to
do our own thing, you know?

65
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:55,225
Make up our own stupid
traditions with the kids.

66
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:59,542
That's because you're a very,
very naive man.

67
00:02:59,552 --> 00:03:01,231
Yeah? Thank you.

68
00:03:01,233 --> 00:03:03,884
(boys yelling, Rebecca screams)

69
00:03:04,671 --> 00:03:06,303
- Jack: Oh!
- Oops.

70
00:03:06,305 --> 00:03:07,726
Okay, okay.

71
00:03:07,736 --> 00:03:09,271
- Boys, change, change, change.
- Sorry.

72
00:03:09,281 --> 00:03:11,108
- Step over this and change.
- Randall: Sorry.

73
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,993
Woman: For me it's cranberry sauce.

74
00:03:12,995 --> 00:03:15,327
Sweet potatoes with marshmallow crust.

75
00:03:15,337 --> 00:03:16,805
Bacon wrapped dates.

76
00:03:16,815 --> 00:03:20,183
Jell-O with the little pieces
of fruit floating on the inside

77
00:03:20,185 --> 00:03:21,952
- and then whipped cream on top.
- Oh!

78
00:03:21,954 --> 00:03:23,794
My weakness is stuffing.

79
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:25,889
- Mm.
- I could eat a whole bowl of it,

80
00:03:25,891 --> 00:03:29,259
but this is my first Thanksgiving
since my gastric bypass surgery,

81
00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:31,011
so my stomach's now
the size of a walnut.

82
00:03:31,013 --> 00:03:34,114
Which means if I overdo it,
I'll be holed up in the bathroom

83
00:03:34,116 --> 00:03:37,779
vomiting my guts out, while everybody
else is watching football. (laughs)

84
00:03:37,789 --> 00:03:39,619
But, hey, I've lost

85
00:03:39,621 --> 00:03:41,316
30 pounds now so far.

86
00:03:41,326 --> 00:03:43,290
So, worth it.

87
00:03:43,292 --> 00:03:45,208
- Right?
- Group Leader: Yes,

88
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:46,543
yes it is.

89
00:03:46,545 --> 00:03:48,228
Now, for everybody else,

90
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,814
Thanksgiving is full of triggers.

91
00:03:50,816 --> 00:03:52,566
So we have to stay vigilant.

92
00:03:52,568 --> 00:03:54,198
But I know you guys can do it.

93
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,086
(clapping)

94
00:04:01,385 --> 00:04:03,296
(mouth full): This is great.

95
00:04:03,306 --> 00:04:04,645
Mm.

96
00:04:04,655 --> 00:04:06,763
So, Thanksgiving in New York.

97
00:04:07,232 --> 00:04:09,064
It's gonna be great. The Big Apple.

98
00:04:09,074 --> 00:04:10,757
I hope your mom likes me.

99
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:13,006
- Toby...
- You know, what am I worried about?

100
00:04:13,016 --> 00:04:14,493
Parents love me,
I'll tell them the story

101
00:04:14,503 --> 00:04:18,227
about the time I met Streisand.
Parents love Streisand.

102
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:22,345
(inhales deeply)

103
00:04:22,725 --> 00:04:25,165
I don't think that you should
come with me to New York.

104
00:04:25,167 --> 00:04:26,665
(laughs)

105
00:04:26,675 --> 00:04:28,586
What? Why? Why not?

106
00:04:30,457 --> 00:04:32,950
Because I think we should take a break.

107
00:04:33,936 --> 00:04:35,308
A... a break?

108
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,793
Mm-hmm.

109
00:04:37,222 --> 00:04:38,478
Why?

110
00:04:39,883 --> 00:04:42,230
Because I've been dreading this date.

111
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,153
Because I knew that you would
eat that and I would eat this.

112
00:04:46,734 --> 00:04:49,991
And because ever since you stopped
dieting, I have felt weak.

113
00:04:50,001 --> 00:04:51,974
Oh, no, I was weak.

114
00:04:51,984 --> 00:04:54,985
The other night I stuffed my
face full of powdered donuts,

115
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:57,195
and then I cried myself to sleep.

116
00:05:00,493 --> 00:05:03,019
Yup.

117
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:06,217
And, listen, if you don't want
to lose weight, that's fine

118
00:05:06,227 --> 00:05:09,704
because that's your choice.

119
00:05:09,706 --> 00:05:10,905
(voice breaking): But I told...

120
00:05:10,907 --> 00:05:12,307
(clears throat)

121
00:05:12,309 --> 00:05:14,292
I told you that when I met you,

122
00:05:14,294 --> 00:05:17,528
that I couldn't fall for a fat person.

123
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,214
But you did.

124
00:05:20,216 --> 00:05:22,283
You fell-you fell for me.

125
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:25,837
So now what?

126
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:28,539
You're just gonna throw me away?

127
00:05:37,224 --> 00:05:39,284
I used to watch romantic comedies

128
00:05:39,286 --> 00:05:43,388
where... the perfect,
charming, Hugh-Grant-guy

129
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:48,459
would bend over backwards
for the woman that he loves.

130
00:05:48,461 --> 00:05:52,931
And I... would think,
"If I could have that,

131
00:05:52,933 --> 00:05:54,832
that I would be happy."

132
00:05:54,834 --> 00:05:56,818
And then I met you.

133
00:05:58,471 --> 00:06:00,872
(inhales deeply)

134
00:06:00,874 --> 00:06:02,357
And you were better than them.

135
00:06:02,359 --> 00:06:05,409
You were better than my
wildest dreams. (chuckles)

136
00:06:06,413 --> 00:06:07,879
Um...

137
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:10,141
(clears throat, then sniffs)

138
00:06:10,617 --> 00:06:13,198
But I'm still not happy, Toby.

139
00:06:15,772 --> 00:06:19,290
Um, and it's not just about my weight.

140
00:06:19,292 --> 00:06:20,792
It's...

141
00:06:20,794 --> 00:06:22,894
it's just...

142
00:06:22,896 --> 00:06:24,579
I've got to get a handle on myself,

143
00:06:24,581 --> 00:06:27,148
on the weight and on all of it.

144
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:29,584
And I, um...

145
00:06:29,586 --> 00:06:33,905
God, I-I need that more than
anything right now, and I want it.

146
00:06:33,907 --> 00:06:35,923
I want it more than anything right now.

147
00:06:35,925 --> 00:06:38,776
(inhales deeply)

148
00:06:38,778 --> 00:06:39,944
(clears throat)

149
00:06:39,946 --> 00:06:42,213
Even more than me?

150
00:06:42,215 --> 00:06:44,215
♪ ♪

151
00:06:47,103 --> 00:06:49,020
(sniffs)

152
00:06:49,022 --> 00:06:52,156
(exhales slowly)

153
00:06:55,362 --> 00:06:58,512
Well, it sounds like you've
made up your mind, so...

154
00:07:05,989 --> 00:07:07,989
(crying and sniffling)

155
00:07:13,758 --> 00:07:17,925
Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.
We're back Monday at 10:00.

156
00:07:21,526 --> 00:07:24,739
Uh, Olivia, I'm guessing you probably
don't celebrate Thanksgiving, right?

157
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:27,980
My mum's American.

158
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,645
I am definitely not getting
together with relatives I hate

159
00:07:30,647 --> 00:07:33,031
so we can gorge ourselves on dry bird,

160
00:07:33,033 --> 00:07:34,665
while pretending that we'd
ever have anything to do

161
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:37,348
with each other if we
weren't related by blood.

162
00:07:37,358 --> 00:07:39,954
Wow. So what are you gonna do then?

163
00:07:39,956 --> 00:07:42,390
I shall be going to my favorite
dive bar in Sunset Park

164
00:07:42,392 --> 00:07:43,958
where they'll be playing Rocky II.

165
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,410
Because they're always playing Rocky II,

166
00:07:45,412 --> 00:07:47,562
and I shall watch Rocky II
with my favorite

167
00:07:47,564 --> 00:07:49,180
borderline senile bartender, Benny,

168
00:07:49,182 --> 00:07:51,516
whilst drinking three to five bourbons.

169
00:07:51,518 --> 00:07:53,360
Have a good break, Kevin.

170
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:55,455
You should celebrate
Thanksgiving with me

171
00:07:55,465 --> 00:07:58,096
and my family, if you,
you know, if you want.

172
00:07:58,228 --> 00:07:59,273
Kevin.

173
00:07:59,275 --> 00:08:01,909
I'm not spending
Thanksgiving in New Jersey

174
00:08:01,911 --> 00:08:04,729
meeting the walking
slices of Wonder Bread

175
00:08:04,731 --> 00:08:07,343
responsible for... this.

176
00:08:08,514 --> 00:08:13,487
Okay, Wonder Bread. Wow, all
right, you are way off, sister.

177

My family is, uh, we're like
whatever the most interesting

178
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,652
kind of bread would be... You
know, we're like multigrain bread.

179
00:08:18,662 --> 00:08:21,035
Except we're not that healthy.
We're like, uh...

180
00:08:21,045 --> 00:08:22,230
we would be ciabatta bread.

181
00:08:22,232 --> 00:08:24,903
That's what we are. Check this out.

182
00:08:25,397 --> 00:08:28,570
My mother is, uh, married to
my dead dad's best friend.

183
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,621
I have a twin sister who
is seriously overweight.

184
00:08:30,623 --> 00:08:32,573
And I have an adopted black brother

185
00:08:32,575 --> 00:08:35,843
who just recently reconnected with
his biological father who is dying.

186
00:08:35,845 --> 00:08:39,680
Now, don't you want to
see that up close, huh?

are on relaxation duty.

295
00:12:26,268 --> 00:12:28,098

- Huh.

- Hey.

297
00:12:30,001 --> 00:12:32,556

301
00:12:37,855 --> 00:12:39,553
You want to put these
in the kitchen for us?

302
00:12:39,563 --> 00:12:41,978
- Absolutely. On my way.
- Good.

303
00:12:46,505 --> 00:12:48,384

304

313
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,625

- You have had enough time.

319
00:13:24,869 --> 00:13:28,191
I need you to find the time to do it
before you leave this house tonight...

320
00:13:28,193 --> 00:13:30,376
- or I will.

00:14:30,689 --> 00:14:32,338
Look at that. Ooh.

348
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,824
51 degrees in New York City.

349
00:14:34,826 --> 00:14:37,377
Rebecca: So, how are things with
the new assistant working out?

350
00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:38,745
Uh, Kelsey?

351
00:14:38,747 --> 00:14:39,779
- Yeah.
- Right?

352
00:14:39,781 --> 00:14:40,911
Uh, not great.

353
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:44,183
She's been adding little one-liners
to her e-mail signature.

354
00:14:44,185 --> 00:14:48,154
Monday's was, "If the glass
is half-empty, add tequila."

355
00:14:48,156 --> 00:14:49,355
She sounds fun.

356
00:14:49,357 --> 00:14:52,457
Yeah, she sent that to the
president of Chase Bank.

357
00:14:52,944 --> 00:14:54,944
- Hey, sweetheart, um...
- Hmm?

358
00:14:54,946 --> 00:14:58,775
We should find some time
to try and talk today.

359
00:14:58,785 --> 00:15:00,867
- Kevin: Hello, hello.
- That's Kevin and his date.

360
00:15:00,877 --> 00:15:02,602
- Kevin: Girls?
- Let's go say hi. To be continued.

361
00:15:02,604 --> 00:15:04,837
- Annie: Hey, Uncle Kevin.
- Kevin: How are you?

362
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:06,289
- Good.
- Good to see you, all right.

363
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:07,440
- Got my keys?
- Yup.

364
00:15:07,442 --> 00:15:08,992
Thank you. Hey, how you doing?

365
00:15:08,994 --> 00:15:10,159
- Mom.
- Hello, sweetheart.

366
00:15:10,161 --> 00:15:12,478
- How are you?
- Happy Thanksgiving.

367
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,163
Kevin: Happy Thanksgiving,
good to see you.

368
00:15:14,165 --> 00:15:15,765
- It's good to see you.
- Miguel: Hey.

369
00:15:16,002 --> 00:15:17,183
- Miguel.
- Kevin.

370
00:15:17,185 --> 00:15:19,185
- Yep.
- How's, uh, the play going?

371
00:15:19,187 --> 00:15:20,820
Having fun at rehearsals?

372
00:15:20,822 --> 00:15:22,722
Fun? (chuckles)

373
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,808
No, Miguel, I'm not having any fun.
It's emotionally brutal work.

374
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:27,404
- But thank you for asking.
- Kevin.

375
00:15:27,414 --> 00:15:29,696
Okay. Look, uh, this is, oh, Olivia.

376
00:15:29,698 --> 00:15:31,598
- Hi... Hello.
- Kevin: Yeah.

377
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,765
- You're pretty.
- Thank you.

378
00:15:34,602 --> 00:15:36,599
You look like Katy Perry.

379
00:15:36,609 --> 00:15:39,533
Uh, this is Tess and Annie and
you've met my brother, Randall.

380
00:15:39,543 --> 00:15:40,780
The adopted one.

381
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,592
- Yeah.
- (Kevin clears throat)

382
00:15:43,506 --> 00:15:46,129
- Hi, Olivia. I'm Rebecca.
- Hi.

383
00:15:46,131 --> 00:15:48,072
Randall and Kevin's mother.
Really glad you could

384
00:15:48,082 --> 00:15:49,399
join us for Thanksgiving.

385
00:15:49,401 --> 00:15:50,883
Well, thank you so much for having me.

386
00:15:50,885 --> 00:15:53,978
I mean, I hate Thanksgiving, but still.

387
00:15:53,988 --> 00:15:56,539
- You're very welcome.
- Randall: Everyone, uh,

388
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:57,640
- get our shoes on.
- Good idea.

389
00:15:57,642 --> 00:16:01,237
Time to get our hike on.
Hey, uh, Beth, William, let's go.

390
00:16:01,247 --> 00:16:03,046
Well, we don't do the hike, do we?

391
00:16:03,048 --> 00:16:05,431
Oh, absolutely.
Pearson Family tradition.

392
00:16:05,433 --> 00:16:07,834
You're gonna love it. (laughs)

393
00:16:07,836 --> 00:16:09,852
You're gonna love it.

394
00:16:09,854 --> 00:16:13,829
You're not. You're not gon... You're
gonna, you're gonna tolerate it.

395
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,034
What's exciting, The guy
doing the sets won a Tony.

396
00:16:16,044 --> 00:16:17,658
- Rebecca: Really?
- Kevin: Yeah.

397
00:16:17,668 --> 00:16:19,862
- Rebecca: That is so great.
- Right?

398
00:16:19,864 --> 00:16:23,099
What is the, uh,
the name of the play again?

399
00:16:23,101 --> 00:16:24,801
(scoffs)

400
00:16:24,803 --> 00:16:26,235
What? Are you serious?

401
00:16:26,237 --> 00:16:27,570
- The Back of an Egg.
- Back of an Egg.

402
00:16:27,572 --> 00:16:28,944
Yeah, Mom, I told you like eight times.

403
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:31,015
I know, I know, I'm sorry. I just, uh...

404
00:16:31,025 --> 00:16:33,326
Grandma and Grandpa,
Tess found a dead bird.

405
00:16:33,328 --> 00:16:35,021
Oh, don't touch it. Here, show me where.

406
00:16:35,031 --> 00:16:36,758
- Come see!
- Okay, come show it to me.

407
00:16:36,768 --> 00:16:40,317
So, your parents, they don't
mind you skipping Thanksgiving?

408
00:16:40,643 --> 00:16:42,852
- No.
- Really?

409
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,425
My mom used to make very
elaborate Thanksgivings.

410
00:16:46,435 --> 00:16:48,825
She'd even make three kinds of pie.

411
00:16:48,827 --> 00:16:52,762
The right kind of pie could save
us from our miserable selves.

412
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:55,577
Then, inevitably,
Dad's beeper would go off,

413
00:16:55,587 --> 00:16:58,495
and he'd pretend it was the hospital,

414
00:16:58,505 --> 00:17:01,988
even though we all knew he
was banging some nurse.

415
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:04,090
And Mom would get sad...

416
00:17:04,092 --> 00:17:07,084
and drunk and angry.

417
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:10,930
You know, the funny thing is,
we had all those pies

418
00:17:10,932 --> 00:17:14,954
and I don't think we ever
once made it to dessert.

419
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:18,688
It pissed me off 'cause
I really like pie.

420
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:20,807
No, no. Relax, relax.

421
00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:22,942
- Have a seat.
- All right.

422
00:17:22,944 --> 00:17:24,927
(groans)

423
00:17:29,651 --> 00:17:31,211
You know, I can go get the car.

424
00:17:31,221 --> 00:17:34,352
No, no, no, no, no.
Just give me a minute.

425
00:17:34,362 --> 00:17:35,735
Okay.

426
00:17:38,616 --> 00:17:40,955
Hey, what'd you used to
do for Thanksgiving?

427
00:17:40,965 --> 00:17:43,222
Oh, I'd spend it with my sober friends.

428
00:17:43,232 --> 00:17:45,193
- Cats I met in the meetings.
- Mmm.

429
00:17:45,203 --> 00:17:47,158
A lot of 'em are musicians.

430
00:17:47,378 --> 00:17:48,767
Most of us didn't have family.

431
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:51,560
None we were on speaking
terms with, anyway.

432
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,835
So we'd have a big potluck.

433
00:17:53,845 --> 00:17:56,563
Everyone would bring their
instruments, and we'd jam all night.

434
00:17:56,573 --> 00:17:58,113
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

435
00:17:58,123 --> 00:18:01,076
Otis Redding, Muddy Waters, you name it.

436
00:18:01,086 --> 00:18:02,717
One of the guys had an old tape player.

437
00:18:02,727 --> 00:18:05,568
He would record us for posterity.

438
00:18:06,645 --> 00:18:10,039
Hmm. I was too sick to
attend last year's, so...

439
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:12,727
I started a whole new
Thanksgiving tradition.

440
00:18:13,484 --> 00:18:15,373
I'd listen to those tapes,

441
00:18:15,383 --> 00:18:18,214
and eat an entire Marie
Callender's "pee-can" pie.

442
00:18:18,216 --> 00:18:19,415
(both laughing)

443
00:18:19,417 --> 00:18:21,517
Or "puh-kahn" pie.

444
00:18:23,506 --> 00:18:26,963
Oh, man, I wish I would
have packed those tapes.

445
00:18:27,562 --> 00:18:29,075
Oh, well.

446
00:18:29,421 --> 00:18:31,828
(sighs)

447
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:34,464
How long did you say this hike was?

448
00:18:34,466 --> 00:18:37,917
Exactly 3.4 miles.

449
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,405
Rebecca: Jack, it's gonna get dark soon.

450
00:18:43,239 --> 00:18:45,057
What do we do now?

451
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:48,277
(exhales)

452
00:18:49,726 --> 00:18:51,083
Now we walk.

453
00:18:52,153 --> 00:18:53,883
- Kate: What?
- Guys.

454
00:18:53,885 --> 00:18:56,106
Come on. It'll be like
a fun little hike.

455
00:18:56,116 --> 00:18:57,443
Mom.

456
00:18:57,751 --> 00:18:59,240
(groaning)

457
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,387
Hey, Randall.

458
00:19:06,389 --> 00:19:08,347
They're finally letting us on the plane,

459
00:19:08,357 --> 00:19:09,858
four hours later.

460
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:12,327
Um, so I'm gonna miss the movie.

461
00:19:12,329 --> 00:19:14,879
But I should make it in time for dinner.

462
00:19:15,422 --> 00:19:16,998
It's just gonna be me.

463
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,767
I'll explain later.

464
00:19:18,769 --> 00:19:20,391
Okay, bye.

465
00:19:34,184 --> 00:19:36,734
Don't worry, I bought both these seats.

466
00:19:37,587 --> 00:19:39,571
(slight laugh)

467
00:19:41,191 --> 00:19:42,757
Here's your seat belt extender.

468
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:44,843
- Let's get you strapped in.
- Oh, I-I got it.

469
00:19:44,845 --> 00:19:46,745
- Thank you.
- You welcome.

470
00:19:53,078 --> 00:19:55,677
Pilot: Hi, folks,
this your captain speaking.

471
00:19:55,687 --> 00:19:57,348
We've got a bit of a wait ahead of us,

472
00:19:57,358 --> 00:19:59,976
as we are 12th in line for takeoff.

473
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,477
Rebecca: How are we not there yet?

474
00:20:02,479 --> 00:20:05,118
I feel like we've been walking for days.

475
00:20:06,466 --> 00:20:07,788
Kevin: What was that sound?

476
00:20:07,798 --> 00:20:09,784
Oh, that's probably just
an animal in the woods.

477
00:20:09,786 --> 00:20:11,352
- What?
- Seriously?

478
00:20:11,354 --> 00:20:12,754
There are animals in the woods?

479
00:20:12,756 --> 00:20:14,739
Rebecca: Okay, okay,
guys, I have an idea.

480
00:20:14,741 --> 00:20:18,136
Why don't we play a game?

481
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,678
- Called The Thanksgiving Game?
- Jack: Great idea.

482
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,315
Everyone is going to tell us

483
00:20:24,317 --> 00:20:27,101
what their Thanksgiving is gonna
be like when they grow up.

484
00:20:27,103 --> 00:20:28,598
- Kev, you start.
- Easy.

485
00:20:28,608 --> 00:20:30,305
I'm gonna be a quarterback
for the Steelers.

486
00:20:30,307 --> 00:20:32,073
I'll play a big game on Thanksgiving,

487
00:20:32,075 --> 00:20:33,815
then go home and eat an entire turkey.

488
00:20:33,825 --> 00:20:35,376
All right, you've given
that some real thought.

489
00:20:35,378 --> 00:20:37,111
Rebecca: Randall, what about you,
bud, what are you gonna do?

490
00:20:37,113 --> 00:20:39,163
I'm not gonna celebrate Thanksgiving.

491
00:20:39,165 --> 00:20:40,331
Why not?

492
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:41,845
When you're a grown up,

493
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,977
you don't have to do stuff you hate.

494
00:20:43,987 --> 00:20:46,004
Kevin: I didn't know no
Thanksgiving was an option.

495
00:20:46,006 --> 00:20:48,369
- I'm not doing it either.
- Me, neither.

496
00:20:48,379 --> 00:20:51,309
- I hate Thanksgiving.
- You guys, come on.

497
00:20:51,311 --> 00:20:54,295
Grandma and Grandpa aren't that bad.

498
00:20:55,043 --> 00:20:57,351
- What?
- It's not just them.

499
00:20:57,483 --> 00:20:58,900
It's you.

500
00:21:01,225 --> 00:21:03,738
You're always mean when
we're at their house and...

501
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,673
you always have this weird...

502
00:21:05,675 --> 00:21:07,158
- and high voice.
- Jack: Okay.

503
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,277
Okay. Don't listen to 'em.

504
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:10,778
Kids are delusional from the cold.

505
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,996
- Keep walking.
- Randall: The cold?

506
00:21:11,998 --> 00:21:13,905
Zip it, you.

507
00:21:14,634 --> 00:21:17,569
Come on, don't listen to 'em.

508
00:21:17,571 --> 00:21:19,287
Come on.

509
00:21:20,075 --> 00:21:21,519
(door opens)

510
00:21:21,529 --> 00:21:24,434
Okay, everybody get cider,
movie starts in ten.

511
00:21:24,444 --> 00:21:26,945
Okay. Jackets off, girls.

512
00:21:31,434 --> 00:21:34,160
Hey, um, I'm gonna run to
William's apartment real quick.

513
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:35,005
What

514
00:21:35,015 --> 00:21:36,939
No, I know, I know. But I'll
be back before the movie's over.

515
00:21:36,949 --> 00:21:39,274
- You got to keep an eye on the turkey.
- No. I mean, why are you...?

516
00:21:39,276 --> 00:21:41,845
Look, he's... he's got these
tapes of him and his friends

517
00:21:41,855 --> 00:21:43,427
playing music, and listening to them

518
00:21:43,437 --> 00:21:45,483
is kind of his Thanksgiving thing.

519
00:21:45,493 --> 00:21:47,285
You're gonna drive two hours

520
00:21:47,295 --> 00:21:48,733
- to go pick up some tapes?
- I think...

521
00:21:48,735 --> 00:21:52,620
That's a little extreme. this may
be his last Thanksgiving, Beth.

522
00:21:54,137 --> 00:21:56,489
Yeah, so that's why you need
to get your ass on the road.

523
00:21:56,499 --> 00:21:58,903
- Hurry up.
- Thank you.

524
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:02,313
- Daddy, is it time to start the movie?
- Yep. You guys

525
00:22:02,315 --> 00:22:04,616
watch it without me. Uh,
Daddy's got to run a quick errand.

526
00:22:04,618 --> 00:22:07,245
Oh, but you, uh,
you love Police Academy III.

527
00:22:07,255 --> 00:22:10,047
I know. That Steve Guttenberg
gets me every time.

528
00:22:10,057 --> 00:22:12,589
Why don't I come with you
and keep you company?

529
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:15,093
And miss the movie? That's your
favorite Thanksgiving tradition.

530
00:22:15,095 --> 00:22:18,096
No, ma'am. I'll be fine.
Oh, um, Kate got a new flight.

531
00:22:18,098 --> 00:22:19,914
She'll be here just in time for dinner.

532
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:22,951
She's not bringing the boyfriend.
Sounds like drama.

533
00:22:22,953 --> 00:22:25,197
Don't know what happened.
All right. Bye. See you.

534
00:22:25,207 --> 00:22:26,788
I'll see you soon, William.

535
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:28,140
(door opens)

536
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:30,091
- Rebecca: I will go get you some cider.
- (door closes)

537
00:22:30,093 --> 00:22:31,526
Miguel: Thank you, honey.

538
00:22:33,893 --> 00:22:35,095
Hey.

539
00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:37,162
Hey.

540
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:39,200
So, I, uh...

541
00:22:39,967 --> 00:22:41,102
I know that you and Thanksgiving

542
00:22:41,104 --> 00:22:42,920
have a... somewhat of a spotty past,

543
00:22:42,922 --> 00:22:45,640
but, um... I wanted you to know

544
00:22:45,642 --> 00:22:48,609
that no matter what happens this year,

545
00:22:48,611 --> 00:22:51,012
you're gonna make it to the pie.

546
00:22:51,014 --> 00:22:53,114
(Police Academy music playing)

547
00:22:57,259 --> 00:22:59,087
- Miguel: Hey, Kevin.
- Yeah...

548
00:22:59,089 --> 00:23:00,555
Hey.

549
00:23:00,557 --> 00:23:01,956
Uh...

550
00:23:02,284 --> 00:23:04,409
I was just kind of wondering if...

551
00:23:04,411 --> 00:23:07,315
maybe this year, I could wear the hat?

552
00:23:08,698 --> 00:23:11,283
- Oh, you want to wear the hat?
- Yeah, I do.

553
00:23:11,293 --> 00:23:13,101
Every year we do your
family's traditions,

554
00:23:13,103 --> 00:23:14,982
which is fine. I-I enjoy them.

555
00:23:14,992 --> 00:23:17,555
But I think it would
be nice if just once

556
00:23:17,557 --> 00:23:20,802
I got to wear the hat
for Tess and Annie.

557
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:22,893
Well, uh, gee.

558
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,263
(grunts) Miguel,
that's not gonna happen.

559
00:23:25,265 --> 00:23:27,914
See, my... my dad wore the hat.

560
00:23:28,329 --> 00:23:30,887
And now Randall and I wear
the hat. We take turns

561
00:23:30,897 --> 00:23:32,286
wearing the hat. This year it's my turn

562
00:23:32,288 --> 00:23:34,301
to wear the hat. So... you know,

563
00:23:34,311 --> 00:23:35,477
no dice.

564
00:23:35,487 --> 00:23:36,708
Okay.

565
00:23:40,738 --> 00:23:43,014
Can you believe that guy? Wants
to wear the hat. I wear the hat

566
00:23:43,016 --> 00:23:45,945
and Randall wears the hat.
That's how we do it.

567
00:23:46,209 --> 00:23:48,352
I'm sorry. I can't do this.

568
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,251
Can't do what?

569
00:23:54,811 --> 00:23:57,223
I can't be who you want me to be.

570
00:23:57,233 --> 00:23:59,262
- I should... I should go.
- (door closes)

571
00:23:59,272 --> 00:24:03,183
- What? Hold on. Wait a minute.
- Please, don't try to stop me.

572
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:06,893
And please stop trying to see
something in me that isn't there.

573
00:24:08,459 --> 00:24:10,028
Olivia...

574
00:24:14,526 --> 00:24:16,792
- Hey, I see something.
- What?

575
00:24:16,794 --> 00:24:18,110
Jack: There it is.

576
00:24:18,112 --> 00:24:19,144
- Randall: Oh, yes!
- Kevin: Oh, yeah!

577
00:24:19,146 --> 00:24:20,412
- Come on.
- Thank you!

578
00:24:20,414 --> 00:24:21,780
Are they gonna get us
a tow truck in there?

579
00:24:21,782 --> 00:24:24,299
Yes, baby, because it's
a Thanksgiving miracle!

580
00:24:24,301 --> 00:24:25,776
- Rebecca: Come on.
- Kate: Yay!

581
00:24:25,786 --> 00:24:27,168
Jack: Come on.

582
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:30,288
Yeah. I can't get you
a tow truck tonight.

583
00:24:31,441 --> 00:24:32,848
Why not?

584
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:37,589
Because it's Thanksgiving.
Everything's closed.

585
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:39,230
If I were you, I'd just
call someone to pick you up

586
00:24:39,232 --> 00:24:41,282
and deal with the car in the morning.

587
00:24:41,777 --> 00:24:44,069
Okay. Why don't you get
the kids some snacks

588
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:46,855
to tide them over,
and I will go call my parents.

589
00:24:47,991 --> 00:24:51,039
Jack: Go sit in the booth.
Come on. Sit down.

590
00:24:52,462 --> 00:24:54,612
(exhales)

591
00:24:58,227 --> 00:25:01,527
- Could we get... those hot dogs to go?
- (phone rings)

592
00:25:01,621 --> 00:25:04,008
Hi, Mom. It's me.

593
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:08,793
Yeah, I know what time it is.
I'm sorry. We had a tire blow out.

594
00:25:09,782 --> 00:25:13,782
Yeah. Everybody's okay.
We're fine. We're okay.

595
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,903
I didn't call you sooner because
I couldn't call you sooner.

596
00:25:16,913 --> 00:25:18,859
That's why I'm calling you now.

597
00:25:18,869 --> 00:25:21,089
I know how hard you work
to prepare dinner, Mom.

598
00:25:21,091 --> 00:25:23,675
Do you really think that we
wanted to drive through a fence?

599
00:25:23,677 --> 00:25:26,444
Can you just have Dad come and...

600
00:25:26,446 --> 00:25:27,762
(sighs)

601
00:25:30,951 --> 00:25:32,083
No.

602
00:25:32,085 --> 00:25:34,135
No, no, no, no, no. I am not gonna

603
00:25:34,137 --> 00:25:36,204
subject my kids to that this year.

604
00:25:36,206 --> 00:25:37,605
So...

605
00:25:38,458 --> 00:25:40,208
we're not coming.

606
00:25:40,795 --> 00:25:42,870
We're not coming anymore.

607
00:25:43,522 --> 00:25:45,079
Sorry.

608
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:48,176
- Hmm.
- Okay.

609
00:25:49,286 --> 00:25:51,102
So, what's the new plan?

610
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,337
(sighs)

611
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:58,532
Uh, I guess we're having Thanksgiving

612
00:25:58,542 --> 00:26:00,261
at the Pinewood Lodge. Pinewood Lodge.

613
00:26:00,263 --> 00:26:02,397
I love it. I love it.

614
00:26:02,969 --> 00:26:04,983
I love it.

615
00:26:05,273 --> 00:26:07,836
I can't believe I just did that.

616
00:26:08,636 --> 00:26:10,339
- I really did that.
- We'll worry about it later. You did.

617
00:26:10,349 --> 00:26:12,373
Jack: Let's get the kids.

618
00:26:16,873 --> 00:26:19,119
I just came out for some air.

619
00:26:19,339 --> 00:26:21,234
I'm waiting for my Uber.

620
00:26:22,711 --> 00:26:24,536
I don't know what that is.

621
00:26:34,165 --> 00:26:36,218
How does it feel to be dying?

622
00:26:46,006 --> 00:26:48,309
It feels...

623
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:54,007
like all these beautiful pieces of
life are flying around me and...

624
00:26:54,219 --> 00:26:56,534
I'm trying to catch them.

625
00:26:58,875 --> 00:27:01,039
When my granddaughter
falls asleep in my lap,

626
00:27:01,761 --> 00:27:05,685
I try to catch the feeling
of her breathing against me.

627
00:27:05,835 --> 00:27:08,361
And when I make my son laugh,

628
00:27:08,537 --> 00:27:11,950
I try to catch the
sound of him laughing.

629
00:27:11,952 --> 00:27:14,385
How it rolls up from his chest.

630
00:27:18,121 --> 00:27:22,660
But the pieces are moving faster now,
and I can't catch them all.

631
00:27:23,161 --> 00:27:26,061
I can feel them slipping
through my fingertips.

632
00:27:27,263 --> 00:27:30,041
And soon where there used to
be my granddaughter breathing

633
00:27:30,051 --> 00:27:33,540
and my son laughing, there will be...

634
00:27:33,945 --> 00:27:35,156
nothing.

635
00:27:39,015 --> 00:27:40,363
(quietly): Oh.

636
00:27:41,271 --> 00:27:44,657
I know it feels like you have
all the time in the world.

637
00:27:44,904 --> 00:27:47,068
But you don't.

638
00:27:47,444 --> 00:27:49,779
So, stop playing it so cool.

639
00:27:50,052 --> 00:27:52,386
Catch the moments of your life.

640
00:27:52,388 --> 00:27:55,806
Catch them while you're young and quick.

641
00:27:55,808 --> 00:27:58,642
Because sooner than you
know it, you'll be old.

642
00:27:59,351 --> 00:28:01,044
And slow.

643
00:28:01,486 --> 00:28:04,147
And there'll be no
more of them to catch.

644
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:10,754
And when a nice boy who
adores you offers you pie,

645
00:28:10,756 --> 00:28:12,352
say thank you.

646
00:28:15,127 --> 00:28:17,127

Such a good movie.

By far the best Police Academy.

Hi.

657
00:29:14,803 --> 00:29:16,353
The name's Pilgrim Rick.

658
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:19,322
I take it you come in search of lodging.

659
00:29:20,674 --> 00:29:23,093
You're doing a bit.
You're doing a bit...

660
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:24,711
Uh, yeah.

661
00:29:24,713 --> 00:29:26,947
We're... we're in search of lodging.

662
00:29:27,598 --> 00:29:28,899
I needed a warm bed, too,

663
00:29:28,901 --> 00:29:32,102
when I finally made my
way off the Mayflower.

664
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:34,755
Do you know about the
Mayflower, little kiddies?

665
00:29:34,757 --> 00:29:37,557
Rebecca: Uh, yep. They do know all about

666
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:39,317
- the Mayflower.
- Uh, we'll just... we'll take

667
00:29:39,327 --> 00:29:40,911
your finest room, Rick.

668

00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:52,672
Be careful.

671
00:29:54,995 --> 00:29:56,152
Oh.

672
00:29:56,162 --> 00:29:58,135
(children groaning)

673
00:29:58,145 --> 00:30:00,630
Yeah, I got it, I got it.

674
00:30:01,328 --> 00:30:02,482
Is that real?

675
00:30:02,484 --> 00:30:04,468
No, of course not.

676
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:06,470
Why is it so hot in here?

677
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:10,474
Because the furnace is on high.

678
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:15,256
The furnace is stuck on high, Jack.

679
00:30:15,266 --> 00:30:17,464
Mom, can we take off our
dress clothes, please?

680
00:30:17,466 --> 00:30:19,977
Yes, yes, everybody can strip down.

681
00:30:19,987 --> 00:30:22,335
- Yes.
- Hey, who, uh...

682
00:30:22,743 --> 00:30:25,705
who wants one of the most delicious

683
00:30:26,529 --> 00:30:29,025
gas station hot dogs

684
00:30:29,406 --> 00:30:32,006
in the whole wide
Connecticut woods, huh?

685
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:36,349
That's cold. Can't eat those.

686
00:30:36,351 --> 00:30:40,088
Or how 'bout instead some, uh,
Kraft Singles? Saltines? Yeah?

687
00:30:40,098 --> 00:30:43,698
Is this really what we're gonna
have for Thanksgiving dinner?

688
00:30:44,756 --> 00:30:46,497
This TV has zero channels.

689
00:30:46,507 --> 00:30:49,057
I should have had my dad come to get us.

690
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:53,033
Hey, you know what?
Um, get the kids settled.

691
00:30:53,035 --> 00:30:56,241
I'm gonna talk to Pilgrim Rick,
uh, about, uh...

692
00:30:56,347 --> 00:30:59,393
about the furnace.
I'll... I'll be right back.

693
00:30:59,701 --> 00:31:02,350
Guys, really, I can't interest
you in cheese and crackers?

694
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,244
Children: No.

695
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:14,638
(chuckling)

696
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:18,124
(humming softly)

697
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,281
Hey.

698
00:31:24,283 --> 00:31:25,758
There we go.

699
00:31:26,318 --> 00:31:28,985
(humming)

700
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:53,805
(screaming)

701
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:58,164
(screaming continues)

702
00:32:02,103 --> 00:32:03,636
(screaming)

703
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,932
(anxious chatter)

704
00:32:12,522 --> 00:32:14,035
(intercom dings) Pilot:
Sorry about that folks.

705
00:32:14,045 --> 00:32:16,499
Just some very fast moving cold front.

706
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:18,534
Nothing to worry about. But please,

707
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:21,954
remain in your seats with
your seatbelts fastened.

708
00:32:21,956 --> 00:32:23,637
(chuckles) Sorry,

709
00:32:23,751 --> 00:32:26,275
I thought I was gonna die.

710
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:29,095
(exhales) Me, too.

711
00:32:34,004 --> 00:32:37,236
I almost died married to a man
who's obviously cheating on me.

712
00:32:37,238 --> 00:32:39,555
My kids are out of the house now.

713
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:42,458
I have no reason to
stay with him anymore.

714
00:32:45,222 --> 00:32:47,263
I'm gonna get a divorce.

715
00:32:48,754 --> 00:32:50,578
Life's too short.

716
00:32:57,953 --> 00:32:59,842
(knocking)

717
00:33:00,463 --> 00:33:01,749
Oh, that must be your dad.

718
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:03,896
Kate: Dad has a key.

719
00:33:04,022 --> 00:33:05,511
Uh,

720
00:33:05,698 --> 00:33:07,896
- who is it?
- It's Pilgrim Rick!

721
00:33:08,117 --> 00:33:09,200
Um,

722
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:10,701
Pilgrim Rick, we're...

723
00:33:10,703 --> 00:33:12,709
- We're okay, actually.
- I'm here to fix the furnace!

724
00:33:12,719 --> 00:33:14,242
Yeah, we're fine, Pilgrim Rick.

725
00:33:14,252 --> 00:33:16,090
- I'm coming in!
- (doorknob rattling)

726
00:33:16,092 --> 00:33:17,591
(gasping)

727
00:33:17,593 --> 00:33:18,709
Jack!

728
00:33:18,719 --> 00:33:21,478
(laughing)

729
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,900
There's no Jack here, it's Pilgrim Rick.

730
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:24,844
(Kate laughing)

731
00:33:24,854 --> 00:33:26,483
Do you kiddies know about the Mayflower?

732
00:33:26,485 --> 00:33:28,919
- (laughing)
- Huh? Huh?

733
00:33:28,929 --> 00:33:31,792
What if I told you a
little Thanksgiving story?

734
00:33:32,391 --> 00:33:33,724
How about a kiss for an old Pilgrim?

735
00:33:33,726 --> 00:33:34,975
- No... (shrieking)
- No, no,

736
00:33:34,977 --> 00:33:36,327
no, no, no, mmm...

737
00:33:36,329 --> 00:33:37,962
Mwah!

738
00:33:37,964 --> 00:33:39,500
(all laughing)

739
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:42,152
Tonight, on the itinerary...

740
00:33:42,162 --> 00:33:44,435
of the Pinewood Lodge,

741
00:33:44,437 --> 00:33:46,503
a movie...

742
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:49,728
and an indoor picnic.

743
00:33:49,738 --> 00:33:51,442
Kate: Yes!

744
00:33:52,085 --> 00:33:53,911
- Ooh.
- (laughing)

745
00:33:53,913 --> 00:33:55,296
Get the pillows!

746
00:33:55,298 --> 00:33:57,075
I found it in the office.

747
00:33:57,085 --> 00:33:58,417
- Police Academy III?
- Yeah.

748
00:33:58,419 --> 00:33:59,836
You sure that's appropriate?

749
00:33:59,838 --> 00:34:01,120
Ah, it was either that or 9 1/2 Weeks.

750
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:02,138
- (gasps)
- So...

751
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:05,124
- Police Academy III, guys! Yeah.
- So,

752
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:07,322
we are going to...

753
00:34:07,332 --> 00:34:10,784
skewer our hotdogs

754
00:34:11,625 --> 00:34:13,149
and then...

755
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:14,967
we're gonna roast 'em...

756
00:34:18,904 --> 00:34:20,556
on an open furnace flame.

757
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:23,042
And then once they get
all toasty and warm,

758
00:34:23,044 --> 00:34:24,877
we're gonna wrap it in cheese

759
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:27,780
and then roll it in crushed up crackers.

760
00:34:27,782 --> 00:34:29,982
Thanksgiving cheese dogs.

761
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:31,918
- Cool.
- Get a stick, come on.

762
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,753
- All right, go.
- Yes!

763
00:34:33,755 --> 00:34:36,122
- I want a stick.
- Here you go, Pilgrim Rick.

764
00:34:36,124 --> 00:34:37,874
(chuckling) Thanks, buddy.

765
00:34:43,944 --> 00:34:45,615
Okay, who's up first?

766
00:34:45,617 --> 00:34:46,931
Me.

767
00:34:49,787 --> 00:34:52,138
And that's the kind
of dog you guys want?

768
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:54,574
Oh, come on, guys.

769
00:34:54,576 --> 00:34:56,392
Somebody call for Pilgrim Rick?

770
00:34:56,394 --> 00:34:58,494
I'm sorry I'm late but,
uh, I had to make

771
00:34:58,496 --> 00:35:00,451
a little pit stop at the Mayflower.
Turns out Pilgrim Rick is

772
00:35:00,461 --> 00:35:02,531
lactose intolerant. Well, anyway,

773
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:03,833
I'm here now and I'm looking for

774
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:06,734
a couple of young little pilgrims...

775
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:09,932
to... help me out with the, uh...

776
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:16,909
uh, well the truth is, I am...
I'm actually not Pilgrim Rick.

777
00:35:16,919 --> 00:35:19,548
I'm Pilgrim Kevin. Uncle Kevin, really.

778
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,200
Um...

779
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,518
probably hard for you to tell, though.

780
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:26,505
My acting has become so stellar,
all this stage acting.

781
00:35:26,507 --> 00:35:30,119
Um, don't be sad though,
the-the real Pilgrim Rick is...

782
00:35:30,534 --> 00:35:32,551
Is right behind you.

783
00:35:35,263 --> 00:35:36,359
Come on.

784
00:35:36,369 --> 00:35:37,867
Uh, are you sure?

785
00:35:40,421 --> 00:35:41,404
Have fun.

786
00:35:41,406 --> 00:35:43,339
- Pilgrim Rick!
- Yay!

787
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:45,424
It's me, Pilgrim Rick!

788
00:35:45,426 --> 00:35:48,705
- (door opens)
- You kiddies know about the Mayflower?

789
00:35:48,715 --> 00:35:51,809
Let Pilgrim Rick tell you
a Thanksgiving story.

790
00:35:51,819 --> 00:35:53,424
In 1620...

791
00:35:53,434 --> 00:35:54,600
Find what you needed?

792
00:35:54,602 --> 00:35:56,419
- Yeah.
- All right.

793
00:35:56,421 --> 00:35:58,387
Good. Uh, where's Kate?

794
00:36:00,318 --> 00:36:02,308
She, uh...

795
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:05,077
texted, she'll... She'll be here soon.

796
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:06,579
Okay.

797
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:08,230
Everybody's starving,
you want to get started?

798
00:36:08,232 --> 00:36:09,625
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

799
00:36:09,635 --> 00:36:11,550
Hey, Pilgrim Rick. Can you
lead us into the dining room?

800
00:36:11,552 --> 00:36:14,103
- It's time for dinner.
- Miguel: Absolutely.

801
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:15,838
Everybody, let's go put on a feast.

802
00:36:15,848 --> 00:36:17,556
(Beth laughing)

803
00:36:24,811 --> 00:36:26,961
What else can I help with?

804
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:29,083
(speaks quietly) Okay.

805
00:36:31,209 --> 00:36:32,548

Here, you do the honors.

817
00:36:58,281 --> 00:36:59,397
Thank you.

818
00:37:01,334 --> 00:37:03,317
(theme music playing)

819
00:37:03,319 --> 00:37:05,521
This is probably the
greatest movie ever made.

820
00:37:05,531 --> 00:37:08,697
- Yeah?
- This sweater's so itchy.

821
00:37:08,707 --> 00:37:11,209
Here, let me have it.

822
00:37:14,647 --> 00:37:16,314
I have, uh...

823
00:37:16,316 --> 00:37:18,781
I have an idea for one more
Thanksgiving tradition

824
00:37:18,791 --> 00:37:21,202
before we go to bed. Come here.

825
00:37:21,204 --> 00:37:22,570
What is it?

826
00:37:22,572 --> 00:37:24,338
So we're all gonna go around

827
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,876
and say what we're thankful for.

828
00:37:25,886 --> 00:37:28,159
And then whoever's turn it is,

829
00:37:28,161 --> 00:37:30,111
is going to pull on this yarn

830
00:37:30,113 --> 00:37:32,513
and then throw it to the next person.

831
00:37:32,523 --> 00:37:34,899
(laughing)

832
00:37:34,901 --> 00:37:36,517
Okay.

833
00:37:36,775 --> 00:37:39,172
I am thankful...

834
00:37:39,182 --> 00:37:40,775
for my family.

835
00:37:41,875 --> 00:37:45,860
I'm thankful that we're all safe.

836
00:37:45,862 --> 00:37:47,587
And...

837
00:37:47,597 --> 00:37:50,064
there's no one in the world

838
00:37:50,066 --> 00:37:52,430
I'd rather be too hot

839
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,951
or too cold with.

840
00:37:59,108 --> 00:38:01,659
I am thankful for my family.

841
00:38:02,461 --> 00:38:05,129
I am thankful that everyone's safe.

842
00:38:05,969 --> 00:38:09,625
And there is no one in the whole world

843
00:38:09,635 --> 00:38:11,702
I'd rather be too hot

844
00:38:11,704 --> 00:38:13,654
or too cold with.

845
00:38:14,398 --> 00:38:16,446
Grandma always says the same thing.

846
00:38:16,534 --> 00:38:17,652
(chuckling)

847
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:19,810
Yeah, she does, doesn't she?

848
00:38:29,851 --> 00:38:31,780
Is everything all right, baby?

849
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,060
Um... you girls should
go upstairs and play

850
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:38,446
in Tess's room for a little while.

851
00:38:38,448 --> 00:38:40,214
- But...
- Come on.

852
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:57,868
Why is there a photo of me

853
00:38:57,878 --> 00:39:00,835
and a letter that you sent
to William's apartment?

854
00:39:12,215 --> 00:39:14,198
(exhales slowly)

855
00:39:15,668 --> 00:39:16,801
- Randall...
- No, you know what?

856
00:39:16,803 --> 00:39:20,288
Don't... don't speak.
Please, don't just... um...

857
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:21,689
I went to William's apartment

858
00:39:21,691 --> 00:39:24,058
to get his old Thanksgiving tapes.

859
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:28,009
I was about to go and
I saw this envelope.

860
00:39:28,432 --> 00:39:29,692
I said,

861
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:32,700
I know that handwriting.

862
00:39:32,702 --> 00:39:35,136
That's my mother's handwriting,
but how-how could that be?

863
00:39:35,138 --> 00:39:36,921
That... it doesn't make sense, right?

864
00:39:36,923 --> 00:39:39,422
- (paper rustling)
- So...

865
00:39:40,743 --> 00:39:42,143
I, uh...

866
00:39:43,042 --> 00:39:44,679
"Dear William,

867
00:39:45,165 --> 00:39:47,481
I'm sorry I had to
leave in such a hurry.

868
00:39:48,061 --> 00:39:51,073
But it was wonderful to
see you looking so well

869
00:39:51,083 --> 00:39:54,355
after all these years."

870
00:39:57,293 --> 00:40:00,567
- After all these years.
- (sighs)

871
00:40:04,491 --> 00:40:06,050
Randall, you have to understand...

872
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:09,557
Understand what?
That you knew my father?

873
00:40:13,246 --> 00:40:17,028
That you kept him from
me my entire life?

874
00:40:19,098 --> 00:40:21,585
- Everything that I...
- Just stop... Just stop!

875
00:40:21,595 --> 00:40:23,934
Please, stop.

876
00:40:26,489 --> 00:40:29,150
I can't... I can't even look at you.

877
00:40:30,326 --> 00:40:32,293
(sniffles)

878
00:40:32,689 --> 00:40:36,877
And all the times I asked
you about my family.

879
00:40:36,887 --> 00:40:39,637
And if I hadn't found
him on my own, I'd....

880
00:40:43,382 --> 00:40:45,239
- I got to go.
- Beth: Wait.

881
00:40:45,241 --> 00:40:46,726
(sniffles)

882
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:49,710
Just wait a second, honey.

883
00:40:49,712 --> 00:40:51,315
- Please, babe.
- I just gotta get some time alone.

884
00:40:51,325 --> 00:40:53,230
- Excuse me.
- Hey...

885
00:40:53,232 --> 00:40:56,033
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm so late.

886
00:40:56,448 --> 00:40:58,235
I have an announcement.

887
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:01,492
I've decided to have
gastric bypass surgery.

888
00:41:07,028 --> 00:41:08,963
Your family is amazing.

889
00:41:14,508 --> 00:41:15,553
Randall: Mom?

890
00:41:15,988 --> 00:41:17,972
Yeah, baby.

891
00:41:17,974 --> 00:41:20,341
I changed my mind.

892
00:41:20,343 --> 00:41:23,444
I want to have Thanksgiving
when I grow up.

893
00:41:23,446 --> 00:41:24,528
You do?

894
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:25,898
Yeah.

895
00:41:27,216 --> 00:41:29,300
I know how I want it to be.

896
00:41:29,669 --> 00:41:30,832
How?

897
00:41:31,554 --> 00:41:33,154
Like tonight.

898
00:41:33,156 --> 00:41:35,289
I want every Thanksgiving

899
00:41:35,291 --> 00:41:38,665
to be like this for the rest of my life.

900
00:41:42,236 --> 00:41:43,464
Mm.
