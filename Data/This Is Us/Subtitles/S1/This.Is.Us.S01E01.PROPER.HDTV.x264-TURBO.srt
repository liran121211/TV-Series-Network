00:08:21,747 --> 00:08:24,216
which is what most people choose to do

181
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,418
- because it's folksy.
- Oh,

182
00:08:26,452 --> 00:08:27,786
so you work with Dr. Schneider?

183
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,622
Take a breath for me, dear.

184
00:08:30,656 --> 00:08:32,090
- (EXHALES)
- Deep breath, now.

185
00:08:33,426 --> 00:08:34,926
There you go.

186
00:08:34,961 --> 00:08:37,796
All right. You relaxed?
Good, good, good.

187
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:40,332
Dr. Schneider's appendix burst

188
00:08:40,366 --> 00:08:43,401
an hour ago. He just went
into surgery. No, no,

189
00:08:43,436 --> 00:08:44,803
- no, no, no. Now, stay with me.
- Oh, God. No, I need Dr. Schneider

190
00:08:44,837 --> 00:08:46,404
- 'cause he knows about...
- Stay with me now.

191
00:08:46,439 --> 00:08:49,174
Between his screams of agony, Schneider

192
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:52,444
brought me up to speed on
everything concerning your case.

193
00:08:52,478 --> 00:08:55,547
I know all about these
triplets, and I know that this

194
00:08:55,581 --> 00:08:57,582
- is a high-risk pregnancy.
- Yeah.

195
00:08:57,617 --> 00:08:59,017
But everything's gonna be all right.

196
00:08:59,051 --> 00:09:00,919
This is some kind of bad joke, right?

197
00:09:00,953 --> 00:09:02,921
It is not, unfortunately.

198
00:09:02,955 --> 00:09:06,725
Now, sweetheart, I'm gonna get
straight to your first concern.

199
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:08,627
- Look at me now. Look at me.
- (PANTING)

200
00:09:08,661 --> 00:09:12,063
- Do you see me? I am 73 years old.
- Yeah.

201
00:09:12,098 --> 00:09:14,599
- You know what that means, don't you?
- No.

202
00:09:14,634 --> 00:09:18,870
That means I don't run wind
sprints as fast as I used to,

203
00:09:18,905 --> 00:09:22,774
but my faculties are
otherwise completely intact.

204
00:09:22,808 --> 00:09:25,377
There are days that I wish they weren't,

205
00:09:25,411 --> 00:09:28,580
because then I would retire
and spend my remaining days

206
00:09:28,614 --> 00:09:31,082
doing something more glamorous
than pulling eight-pound objects

207
00:09:31,117 --> 00:09:32,651
out of women's vaginas.

208
00:09:32,685 --> 00:09:34,319
But until that time,

209
00:09:34,353 --> 00:09:36,555
I keep showing up here every day.

210
00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:38,623
All right?

211
00:09:38,658 --> 00:09:41,960
I'm also aware that I'm a
complete stranger to you,

212
00:09:41,994 --> 00:09:44,596
and this is the biggest moment

213
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,598
- of your life.
- Yeah.

214
00:09:46,632 --> 00:09:50,101
- All right? Honey, listen to me,
- Yeah.

215
00:09:50,136 --> 00:09:52,604
I am the best of the best.

216
00:09:52,638 --> 00:09:56,007
And I swear to you, on
the lives of my children

217
00:09:56,042 --> 00:09:59,010
and my grandchildren,
that I am up to the task.

218
00:09:59,045 --> 00:10:01,947
- All right? All right.
- Okay.

219
00:10:01,981 --> 00:10:04,182
- Thank you.
- All right.

220
00:10:04,216 --> 00:10:05,850
Good.

221
00:10:05,885 --> 00:10:08,019
Now, which one of you's pregnant?

222
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:12,376
Now, that was a bad joke, but

223
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:13,792
you just continue to take
those deep breaths...

224
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,500
Let's see... let me see if
any of my people are here.

225
00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:18,931
Let me take a little test.

What can I do to make
you feel better, huh?

234
00:10:35,915 --> 00:10:37,483
You want me to breastfeed you?
Would that make you feel better,

00:10:37,517 --> 00:10:38,484
if I breastfed ya?

- Hey, man.
- What's up?

243
00:10:59,105 --> 00:11:01,573
I'm sorry. You know, I'm trying
to understand, for my character,

244
00:11:01,608 --> 00:11:04,576
you know, um, are-are we
suggesting, you know,

245
00:11:04,611 --> 00:11:07,746
that the Man-ny thinks a grown
man can breastfeed a baby?

246
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:10,849
Are we saying the Man-ny's got brain
damage? 'Cause I could do a voice.

247
00:11:10,884 --> 00:11:13,160
Kevin, I know you care. I know
you care about the character.

248
00:11:13,185 --> 00:11:14,518
I do care about the character.
Thank you.

249
00:11:14,543 --> 00:11:16,755
I also know that you're a
30-something-year-old actor

250
00:11:16,789 --> 00:11:19,591
whose biggest previous role was a
three-episode arc on <i>Nashville.</i>

251
00:11:19,626 --> 00:11:22,294
So say the line or find another job.

252
00:11:22,328 --> 00:11:24,930
Because trust me when I say
that I'll have you replaced

253
00:11:24,964 --> 00:11:26,932
by Ryan Gosling, Ryan
Phillippe, or Ryan Reynolds

254
00:11:26,966 --> 00:11:29,601
or any other handsome Ryan by
the time you get to your car.

255
00:11:29,636 --> 00:11:32,738
And believe me, my ratings will go up.

256
00:11:34,407 --> 00:11:36,175
Ryan Gosling would never do this crap.

257
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:37,543
You are right, Kevin.

258
00:11:37,577 --> 00:11:40,712
Ryan Gosling would never do this crap.

259
00:11:40,747 --> 00:11:42,681
Remember that.

Hi, sweetheart! There's the ball!

You want to play soccer?

265
00:11:56,596 --> 00:11:59,398
- It...
- How's she doing?

266
00:11:59,432 --> 00:12:02,401
Uh, I think she's saving
it for the second half.

- Hi, Mommy!
- All right, well, she made a friend.

274
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,657
I found him.

275
00:12:25,692 --> 00:12:27,292
My father.

276
00:12:27,327 --> 00:12:29,261
What? When?

277
00:12:29,295 --> 00:12:31,663
I, uh... I hired a guy.

278
00:12:31,698 --> 00:12:33,699
It cost about 1,500 bucks.

279
00:12:33,733 --> 00:12:36,335
Now, I paid for it on the Amex.
You're gonna see it.

280
00:12:36,369 --> 00:12:37,912
It's the personal Amex,
not the business Amex.

281
00:12:37,936 --> 00:12:39,139
- I don't care about the Amex.
- I know, I know.

282
00:12:40,673 --> 00:12:41,840
So you're gonna...

283
00:12:41,874 --> 00:12:44,276
- No.
- Why not?

284
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:46,612
Because she was a crack addict
who died during childbirth,

285
00:12:46,646 --> 00:12:48,814
and he was the guy who
left me at a fire station,

286
00:12:48,848 --> 00:12:51,650
probably because he couldn't
think of anything more cliché.

287
00:12:51,684 --> 00:12:53,452
So why'd you find him?

288
00:12:54,787 --> 00:12:57,389
I don't know, Beth.

289
00:12:57,423 --> 00:12:59,758
I really don't know.

(GAGS)

297
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:42,858
...and so, I said to myself, "Tanya,

298
00:13:42,901 --> 00:13:45,169
"you have done what you
have set out to do.

299
00:13:45,203 --> 00:13:47,004
"You have lost the weight.

be skinny like you."

00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,281

Every time I'm going on a diet,

304
00:13:59,818 --> 00:14:01,585
he sabotages me.

305
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,021
Well, my husband found me
eating out of the fridge

306
00:14:04,056 --> 00:14:06,691
in the middle of the night
again the other night.

307

308
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,094
I'm trying.

309
00:14:10,128 --> 00:14:12,930
I'm not sabotaging you, Marsha.

310
00:14:12,964 --> 00:14:15,866
I know I don't have the same
issues as everyone here.

311
00:14:15,901 --> 00:14:19,303
But you guys don't know what
it's like looking like me

312
00:14:19,337 --> 00:14:21,672
and carrying around that extra
seven pounds in your midsection.

313
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,980
WOMAN: For me,

314
00:14:30,015 --> 00:14:32,083
it was my mom.

315
00:14:32,117 --> 00:14:33,718
She never let us eat pizza.

316
00:14:33,752 --> 00:14:37,655
And so now, every time I see a pizza,

317
00:14:37,689 --> 00:14:40,491
(CRYING): I mean, I have
to eat the entire thing.

318
00:14:40,525 --> 00:14:42,660
If this doesn't work, I might just

319
00:14:42,694 --> 00:14:44,745
have my stomach stapled
and just be done with...

326
00:14:57,709 --> 00:15:00,010
which is totally inappropriate.

327
00:15:00,045 --> 00:15:02,947
I apologize.

328
00:15:02,981 --> 00:15:04,415
I'm way fatter than you if it...

329
00:15:04,449 --> 00:15:05,683
- means anything.

Mmm, coffee.

332
00:15:17,129 --> 00:15:18,996
Hi.

333
00:15:20,432 --> 00:15:23,601
Boy, these people hate me.

334
00:15:23,635 --> 00:15:25,369
You kind of crossed the line.

335
00:15:25,403 --> 00:15:27,772
Yeah, you laughed.

336
00:15:27,806 --> 00:15:29,807
- That's because I live across the line.
- Oh!

337
00:15:29,841 --> 00:15:32,143
(LAUGHING): Okay.

338

00:15:33,445 --> 00:15:34,779
Kate.

340
00:15:34,813 --> 00:15:36,046
Yeah.

341
00:15:36,081 --> 00:15:37,481
Nice to meet you.

342
00:15:37,516 --> 00:15:39,717
So, you want to be fat friends?

343
00:15:39,751 --> 00:15:42,119

344
00:15:42,154 --> 00:15:43,921
Sure.

345
00:15:43,955 --> 00:15:46,023
- But I'm gonna lose the weight.
- You know,

346
00:15:46,057 --> 00:15:48,692
I'm probably not.

347
00:15:48,727 --> 00:15:50,628
Okay.

348
00:15:55,901 --> 00:15:57,635
I can't fall for a fat person right now.

349
00:15:59,304 --> 00:16:01,172
Well...

350
00:16:01,206 --> 00:16:02,573
I guess I'll lose the weight then.

351
00:16:08,914 --> 00:16:10,748
Breathe, Bec. Breathe, breathe,
breathe, breathe, breathe. (GROANING)

- Breathe. Breathe.
- (BLOWS OUT)

353
00:16:12,717 --> 00:16:14,118
Deep breath, Bec.

354
00:16:14,152 --> 00:16:15,452
Deep breath, deep breath.

355
00:16:15,487 --> 00:16:17,922
Deep breathe, look at me, deep breathe.

356
00:16:17,956 --> 00:16:19,290
- There you go.
- (BREATHING HEAVILY)

357
00:16:19,324 --> 00:16:20,791
There you go, almost done, almost done.

358
00:16:20,826 --> 00:16:22,626
(BOTH BREATHE HEAVILY)

359
00:16:22,661 --> 00:16:25,796
There you go. Hey, there you go.

360
00:16:25,831 --> 00:16:28,799
Baby, I'm sorry for anything I'm
gonna say in the next two hours.

361
00:16:28,834 --> 00:16:30,401
I mean none of it.

362
00:16:30,435 --> 00:16:32,803
- You're gonna mean some of it.
- Very little of it.

363
00:16:32,838 --> 00:16:33,538
Fair enough.

364
00:16:33,563 --> 00:16:35,639
I'm almost glad Schneider's
appendix burst.

365
00:16:35,674 --> 00:16:36,907
I like you two.

366
00:16:36,942 --> 00:16:41,278
Now since I'm new here, I thought
we might have a conversation now

367
00:16:41,313 --> 00:16:43,380
before things get more intense.

368
00:16:43,415 --> 00:16:45,516
Yeah, that sounds nice.

369
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,084
So, you said you have grandchildren?

370
00:16:47,118 --> 00:16:48,752
Not that kind of conversation.

371
00:16:48,787 --> 00:16:52,356
Now. I know that Dr. Schneider talked to
you about the positioning of the babies,

372
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,692
and how complicated this
delivery could get.

373
00:16:54,726 --> 00:16:55,451
I thought we should...

374
00:16:55,476 --> 00:16:57,428
I'm sorry, no, we're not gonna
have this conversation.

375
00:16:57,462 --> 00:16:59,830
- Jack, we need to have this...
- We're not having this conversation

376
00:16:59,865 --> 00:17:02,099
- because it's not gonna happen.
- Well, we need to talk about...

377
00:17:02,133 --> 00:17:03,567
We are walking out of this hospital with

378
00:17:03,602 --> 00:17:05,536
three healthy babies
and one healthy wife.

379
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:07,104
- Absolutely, but we still...
- I have three cribs

380
00:17:07,138 --> 00:17:10,541
at our new home that
we bought specifically

381
00:17:10,575 --> 00:17:13,043
- for our three children to grow up in.
- I understand.

382
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:15,330
My-my mother, my mother has
already knitted three onesies.

383
00:17:15,355 --> 00:17:16,080
I know.

384
00:17:16,114 --> 00:17:19,183
And she's a slow, no-talent knitter.

385
00:17:19,217 --> 00:17:22,953
It's also happens to be my
birthday today, which tends to be

386
00:17:22,988 --> 00:17:25,422
a pretty great day in our house,
a day when I get pretty lucky.

387
00:17:25,457 --> 00:17:27,124
(CHUCKLES)

388
00:17:27,158 --> 00:17:29,293
So I'm gonna need everyone
in this room to believe me

389
00:17:29,327 --> 00:17:33,397
when I say that only good things
are gonna happen here today.

390
00:17:33,431 --> 00:17:34,932
Actually...

391
00:17:34,966 --> 00:17:38,035
I-I don't just want you to believe it.

392
00:17:38,069 --> 00:17:40,804
I want you to know it.

393
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:42,373
Do you know it, baby?

394
00:17:43,775 --> 00:17:45,910
I love you.

395
00:17:45,944 --> 00:17:47,645
Yeah, I know it.

396
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:48,779
I know it.

397
00:17:50,115 --> 00:17:51,849
Do you know it, Doc?

398
00:17:54,953 --> 00:17:57,254
I know I like you.

399
00:17:59,391 --> 00:18:02,393
Let's just start there,
get you what you want.

400
00:18:03,695 --> 00:18:04,895
(EXHALES)

401
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:06,096
Okay.

402
00:18:11,136 --> 00:18:12,903
Hey, clear my afternoon?

403
00:18:12,938 --> 00:18:15,265
WOMAN (OVER INTERCOM):
But sir, what about...?

404
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:16,064
Thanks.

405
00:18:27,752 --> 00:18:30,087
<i>(BUZZER SOUNDS)</i>

406
00:18:30,121 --> 00:18:32,089
<i>(POUNDING ON DOOR)</i>

407
00:18:32,123 --> 00:18:34,625
MAN: Yeah, yeah.

408
00:18:34,659 --> 00:18:36,393
Stop all that banging, I
heard you the first time,

409
00:18:36,428 --> 00:18:37,628
banging on the door.

410
00:18:37,662 --> 00:18:39,229
Who the hell is...

411
00:18:39,264 --> 00:18:42,066
My name is Randall Peasing.
I'm your biological son.

412
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,735
36 years ago you left
me at the front door...

413
00:18:44,769 --> 00:18:46,971
No, hold on, just let me say this.

414
00:18:47,005 --> 00:18:50,674
36 years ago you left me at the
front door of a fire station.

415
00:18:50,709 --> 00:18:51,909
Now, don't worry, I'm not here

416
00:18:51,943 --> 00:18:53,077
because I want anything from you.

417
00:18:53,111 --> 00:18:55,713
I was raised by two incredible parents,

418
00:18:55,747 --> 00:18:58,716
I have a lights out
family of my own, and...

419
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,218
that car you see parked out
in front of your house?

420
00:19:01,252 --> 00:19:04,888
Cost $143,000 and I bought it for cash.

421
00:19:04,923 --> 00:19:07,891
I bought it for cash
because I felt like it,

422
00:19:07,926 --> 00:19:09,994
and because I can do stuff like that.

423
00:19:10,028 --> 00:19:13,364
Yeah, you see, I turned
out pretty all right.

424
00:19:13,398 --> 00:19:15,065
Which might surprise a lot of folks

425
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,101
considering the fact that 36 years ago

426
00:19:17,135 --> 00:19:20,404
my life started with you leaving
me on a fire station doorstep

427
00:19:20,438 --> 00:19:22,506
with nothing more than a ratty blanket

428
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,842
and a crap-filled diaper.

429
00:19:24,876 --> 00:19:29,279
I came here today so I
could look you in the eye,

430
00:19:29,314 --> 00:19:32,683
say that to you, and then get
back in my fancy-ass car

431
00:19:32,717 --> 00:19:35,552
and finally prove to myself, and to you,

432
00:19:35,587 --> 00:19:36,887
and to my family who loves me,

433
00:19:36,921 --> 00:19:39,390
that I didn't need a thing from you,

434
00:19:39,424 --> 00:19:41,625
even after I knew who you were.

435
00:19:42,961 --> 00:19:46,296
- You want to come in?
- Okay.

436
00:19:56,834 --> 00:19:58,834
So is there something
you want to say to me?

437
00:19:58,858 --> 00:20:00,826
'Cause otherwise, I
really need to get going.

438
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,494
You want <i>me to say something?</i>

439
00:20:02,529 --> 00:20:04,296
No, I told you, I don't
want anything from you.

440
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:06,398
- But you're here.
- Just to tell you that.

441
00:20:06,433 --> 00:20:08,300
Well...

442
00:20:08,334 --> 00:20:10,569
I've been told.

443
00:20:10,603 --> 00:20:13,639
You know what? If you're just
gonna sit here making excuses...

444
00:20:13,673 --> 00:20:16,108
- Didn't make any excuses.
- Because there's nothing you can say.

445
00:20:16,142 --> 00:20:18,477
Didn't say anything
for just that reason.

446
00:20:22,715 --> 00:20:26,785
Seems to me you want <i>me</i> to try
to make amends so you can say,

447
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,288
- "Screw you," and storm out of here.
- That's ridiculous.

448
00:20:29,322 --> 00:20:31,657
Okay.

449
00:20:36,154 --> 00:20:39,757
I'd like to say I
remember that day, but...

450
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:41,158
I barely do.

451
00:20:42,794 --> 00:20:44,762
I'm clean now, finally, but...

452
00:20:44,796 --> 00:20:47,097
I was on the streets then.

453
00:20:48,433 --> 00:20:51,168
I remember her dying,

454
00:20:51,202 --> 00:20:54,104
your mom, remember the baby.

455
00:20:56,775 --> 00:21:00,444
I'd like to say I remember
leaving you at a fire station,

456
00:21:00,478 --> 00:21:01,912
but I don't.

457
00:21:01,946 --> 00:21:03,514
Not an excuse.

458
00:21:03,548 --> 00:21:05,916
In fact, it probably tells
you something about me

459
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:08,652
that I don't remember.

460
00:21:11,623 --> 00:21:13,624
I do like fire stations, though,

461
00:21:13,658 --> 00:21:15,626
so that sounds like something I'd do

462
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,961
if I had to do something, you know?

463
00:21:21,199 --> 00:21:23,600
Anyway, I don't know if that's
what you're looking for,

464
00:21:23,635 --> 00:21:25,402
but either way, you can be sure

465
00:21:25,437 --> 00:21:27,071
this life of mine is punishment enough

466
00:21:27,105 --> 00:21:28,672
for the things I've done.

467
00:21:28,707 --> 00:21:31,275
- If you think I'm gonna forgive you...
- I don't.

468
00:21:31,309 --> 00:21:32,910
No, you were right. I did just want

469
00:21:32,944 --> 00:21:34,344
to say, "Screw you,"
and storm out of here.

470
00:21:34,379 --> 00:21:37,381
- Well, go ahead.
- Screw you.

471
00:21:37,415 --> 00:21:38,782
Yup.

472
00:21:41,252 --> 00:21:43,587

474
00:21:50,628 --> 00:21:52,830
I'll get my coat.

Hey. Alan.

477
00:21:58,002 --> 00:21:59,470
All right. Hey, thanks
for doing this, man.

478
00:21:59,504 --> 00:22:00,871
- Oh.
- I really appreciate it.

479
00:22:00,905 --> 00:22:03,540
Oh, please. No thanks necessary.

480
00:22:03,575 --> 00:22:07,244
Trust me: they're paying
me an absolute fortune.

- (CHUCKLES)
- I'm sure.

482
00:22:08,613 --> 00:22:10,147
Great scene for you, by the way.

- You know?
- Yeah.

Tell ya what, when the prick
wants to, he can actually write.

485
00:22:13,351 --> 00:22:15,119
Yeah. Well,

486
00:22:15,153 --> 00:22:16,620
I'll see you out there
on the playing field.

487
00:22:16,654 --> 00:22:18,222
- All right.
- Break a leg, kid.

488
00:22:18,256 --> 00:22:19,556
Thank you, sir.

- Son...
- Don't call me "son."

Just go. Just do your
thing, get out of here.

I would do anything for her.

You understand? Y-You show me a train,

501
00:22:47,819 --> 00:22:50,854
I'll jump in front of it
for her, no question.

502

the past 30 years like
the way you have, I...

505
00:22:57,762 --> 00:22:59,797
I don't understand that and
I'll never understand you,

506
00:22:59,831 --> 00:23:01,265
so just get the hell out of here.

507
00:23:03,001 --> 00:23:04,334
Just get out.

508
00:23:08,139 --> 00:23:09,740
I want you to get out and this time,

509

I want you to stay the
hell out of my life, okay?

510

- Son...
- Leave!

511
00:23:22,287 --> 00:23:23,520

00:38:54,552 --> 00:38:56,887
Listen, okay, Kevin...

876
00:39:05,697 --> 00:39:08,098
Do you remember what Dad used to say?

877
00:39:08,132 --> 00:39:11,301
When something crappy
would happen to us?

878
00:39:13,689 --> 00:39:19,727
<i>Whenever we'd get down, whenever we
felt like life wasn't going our way?</i>

879
00:39:20,545 --> 00:39:21,878
Which one's yours?

880
00:39:21,913 --> 00:39:24,217
Um... those two.

881
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:26,059

Wow.

How about you? Which one's yours?

884
00:39:30,388 --> 00:39:32,055
None of 'em, actually.

885
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:34,358
Strangest damn thing.

886
00:39:34,392 --> 00:39:36,126
Someone left a newborn
at my fire station.

887
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,262
I didn't know what to do,
so I brought him here.
