a fat person right now.

00:06:26,843 --> 00:06:28,393
You got to keep going, though.

175
00:06:28,395 --> 00:06:30,178
This is the tough
part, but you got this.

176
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,828
Yeah.

177
00:06:32,682 --> 00:06:34,179
Good job.

178
00:06:34,642 --> 00:06:37,015
Down. Down is great.

179
00:06:37,654 --> 00:06:39,771
Thanks. Nice work, nice work.

180
00:06:39,773 --> 00:06:41,773
- All right.
- All right, Toby, you ready?

181
00:06:41,775 --> 00:06:43,658
- Yup.
- All right.

182
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:46,160
- (scale beeping)
- Okay. Oh, wow.

183
00:06:46,162 --> 00:06:48,146
- You lost eight more pounds, mister.
- Yeah.

184
00:06:48,171 --> 00:06:49,617
- All right.
- You know what that means?

185
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:52,834
Hey, guys, guess who
just met their month goal?

186
00:06:52,836 --> 00:06:54,168
This guy!

187
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,870
(laughs)

188
00:06:55,872 --> 00:06:58,256
Nice. Hey, yeah, Toby, do you
mind if we take a victory pic?

189
00:06:58,258 --> 00:07:00,758
- Oh, no, no, that's not necessary.
- No, of course it is.

190
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,627
- No, it's no biggie.
- You hit your goal.

191
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:05,875
- It's no biggie.
- No. You are no biggie... anymore.

192
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:06,992
- Yeah.
- I'm proud of you, Toby.

193
00:07:07,016 --> 00:07:08,350
Go, give 'em what they want.

194
00:07:08,351 --> 00:07:09,398
Okay, all right.

195
00:07:09,423 --> 00:07:11,646
Uh, I'll do the... I'll
do the victory photo.

196
00:07:11,671 --> 00:07:12,997
WOMAN: Yes, let's do it.
All right, we're doing it.

197
00:07:13,022 --> 00:07:14,605
WOMAN: All right,
guys, let's get in here.

198
00:07:14,607 --> 00:07:16,224
- TOBY: Victory photo.
- WOMAN: Come on, circle it up.

199
00:07:16,226 --> 00:07:18,726
- All right, one, two, three.
- TOBY: Ah!

200
00:07:18,728 --> 00:07:20,228
- ALL: Cheese!
- TOBY: Cheese!

201
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:22,980
WOMAN: Super cute. Another one. Smile!

202
00:07:22,982 --> 00:07:25,257
Yes! Beautiful!

RANDALL: I want to make a big
push on rising temp futures.

205
00:07:36,352 --> 00:07:38,983
Some of our clients don't
currently believe in science,

206
00:07:39,008 --> 00:07:40,508
but we'll have 'em watch

207
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,804
an Al Gore documentary once
the cash starts rolling in.

208
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:43,882
Am I right, people?

209
00:07:45,713 --> 00:07:48,180
Come on, guys, nothing? That was...

210
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:50,882
Is that the Manny?

211
00:07:51,986 --> 00:07:54,202
Yup. That's the Manny.

212
00:07:54,743 --> 00:07:56,468
- I'm early!
- Right.

213
00:07:56,618 --> 00:07:58,318
I'll be right there. (clears his throat)

214
00:07:58,343 --> 00:07:59,592
You guys look sharp.

215
00:08:00,017 --> 00:08:00,983
(woman laughs)

216
00:08:01,008 --> 00:08:03,509
I'll meet you in the...
meet you in the office.

217
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:05,505
Okay. Cool. Just chill
out in your office?

218
00:08:05,507 --> 00:08:06,507
Yeah.

219
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:10,187
That is the Manny. It is. (laughing)

- Really?
- Yeah.

226
00:08:24,859 --> 00:08:26,703
I don't remember the last
time I was this nervous.

227
00:08:26,728 --> 00:08:28,912
Oh, it's just rehearsal, right?

228
00:08:28,937 --> 00:08:31,648
Yeah, but it's my first
rehearsal in ten years.

229
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,316
You're gonna do great, babe.

230
00:08:35,296 --> 00:08:37,237
- (clears throat)
- Hey, uh,

231
00:08:37,239 --> 00:08:39,739
what are you planning on wearing
to the boy's game tonight?

232
00:08:39,741 --> 00:08:41,792
Because I know we usually
wear Kevin's colors, but now

233
00:08:41,794 --> 00:08:43,210
that Randall's playing
for another school...

234
00:08:43,212 --> 00:08:44,544
The game. Crap.

235
00:08:44,546 --> 00:08:46,580
Um, I'm meeting Bob Parrish tonight

236
00:08:46,582 --> 00:08:48,648
to close the Doylestown deal.

237
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:51,168
- Doylestown?
- Yeah.

238
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,336
Really? So you got it?

239
00:08:53,757 --> 00:08:55,531
I-I told you last week.

240
00:08:55,882 --> 00:08:58,425
Well, I'm sure I would have
remembered if you said that.

241
00:08:58,427 --> 00:09:02,012
- Oh, I know that I did.
- Okay, well,

242
00:09:02,014 --> 00:09:04,431
is there any way that
you can move the meeting

243
00:09:04,433 --> 00:09:06,233
because that coach is
coming to scout Kevin?

244
00:09:06,235 --> 00:09:07,968
It's a really big game for him.

245
00:09:08,187 --> 00:09:11,605
It's a big day for me,
too, and a big day for you.

246
00:09:11,835 --> 00:09:13,490
And a big day for Kevin, so...

247
00:09:13,492 --> 00:09:14,608
(sighs)

248
00:09:14,992 --> 00:09:16,693
I'll see what I can do.

249
00:09:16,695 --> 00:09:18,161
- Okay.
- Okay.

250
00:09:18,647 --> 00:09:21,054
- Jack?
- Yeah.

251
00:09:24,453 --> 00:09:26,753
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

252
00:09:28,453 --> 00:09:31,258
I'm all over the place.

253
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,709
- Have a good day.
- Have fun.

254
00:09:32,711 --> 00:09:34,031
Thanks.

255
00:09:53,007 --> 00:09:54,506
Yeah.

256
00:09:55,608 --> 00:09:57,341
- RANDALL: No, of course.
- Hey.

257
00:09:57,366 --> 00:09:59,677
I totally understand. We
can do dinner another time.

258
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:02,093
That was Mom? She's not
coming? What'd she say?

259
00:10:02,118 --> 00:10:03,921
Yeah. Well, tell Miguel
I hope he feels better soon.

260
00:10:03,946 --> 00:10:04,968
Let me talk to her. Is Miguel sick?

261
00:10:04,993 --> 00:10:06,522
- Let me just talk to her real quick.
- Yeah, I'll tell Kevin.

262
00:10:06,547 --> 00:10:07,327
Just give me the phone.

263
00:10:07,352 --> 00:10:08,725
- Just put her on speaker.
- We can reschedule.

264
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,014
Just let me talk to her before you go.

265
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:11,069
Love you, too. Bye.

266
00:10:11,094 --> 00:10:12,536
Before she... Let
me talk to her for...

267
00:10:12,561 --> 00:10:13,796
Oh. It's Miguel's gout.

268
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,991
Really? I didn't know they
made gout anymore.

269
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:17,469
Yeah.

270
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:19,475
- So she's not coming then?
- No.

271
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:21,655
Not coming. Oh, okay.

272
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,218
(exhales)

273
00:10:23,243 --> 00:10:24,909
- It's the two of us.
- Yes.

274
00:10:24,934 --> 00:10:25,546
Yeah.

275
00:10:25,571 --> 00:10:27,124
I mean, if you got
work to do though, I...

276
00:10:27,149 --> 00:10:28,405
- we don't have to go.
- No!

277
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,263
- I'm, I'm okay.
- You're all right?

278
00:10:30,288 --> 00:10:33,077
- Yeah.
- Uh, if you've got lines to learn

279
00:10:33,102 --> 00:10:35,903
- or something, then we can...
- I'm good. I'm up to speed, so...

280
00:10:37,594 --> 00:10:39,124
You and me.

281
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:40,639
You and I.

282
00:10:40,664 --> 00:10:43,965
BETH: Hey, girls, wash up and come down.

283
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:49,078
So, Kevin and Randall are out tonight.

284
00:10:50,087 --> 00:10:52,694
It'll just be you and us ladies.

285
00:10:53,058 --> 00:10:55,725
Nothing for me, thanks.

286
00:10:57,337 --> 00:10:59,671
(coughs)

287
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:05,563
You know, my dad had cancer.

288
00:11:07,132 --> 00:11:08,358
Lung.

289
00:11:10,104 --> 00:11:11,944
I didn't want to say
anything 'cause, you know,

290
00:11:11,969 --> 00:11:14,538
it wasn't exactly a
happy ending for him.

291
00:11:16,043 --> 00:11:17,991
Endings rarely are.

292
00:11:23,135 --> 00:11:24,561
Weed helped.

293
00:11:26,193 --> 00:11:29,027
With the appetite, you know? But...

294
00:11:29,492 --> 00:11:31,242
I just figured with your history,

295
00:11:31,244 --> 00:11:32,702
I didn't want to bring
that up because of...

296
00:11:32,727 --> 00:11:35,728
No... Marijuana doesn't have
the same kind of trigger.

297
00:11:36,449 --> 00:11:37,874
Even my doctor said.

298
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:39,315
Hmm.

299
00:11:39,968 --> 00:11:41,502
Can't have you going out in the night

300
00:11:41,504 --> 00:11:43,137
scoring drugs on my account.

301
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:45,132
What... what if I was to
tell you I had a little stash?

302
00:11:45,921 --> 00:11:48,259
Then I'd say, woman, you surprise me.

303
00:11:48,261 --> 00:11:50,061
And I'm not easily surprised.

304
00:11:50,063 --> 00:11:51,944
How about I feed the girls, right?

305
00:11:51,969 --> 00:11:53,719
Get their asses in bed,

306
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,093
and bake us up some special brownies.

307
00:11:56,952 --> 00:11:58,686
- I like that plan.
- You like that?

308
00:11:58,688 --> 00:11:59,936
- (chuckles)
- Yeah.

309
00:11:59,961 --> 00:12:01,627
Right.

310
00:12:01,858 --> 00:12:04,659
Hey! How are you?

311
00:12:04,661 --> 00:12:06,554
(shouting): What do you think?
This place is great, right?

312
00:12:06,579 --> 00:12:07,132
Yeah.

313
00:12:07,157 --> 00:12:09,974
Yeah. The last time I was here,
I bro'ed out with Mario Lopez.

314
00:12:09,999 --> 00:12:11,225
I don't know who that is.

315
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,741
Oh, okay. (laughs)

316
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:14,632
Oh, my God. We love you.

317
00:12:14,657 --> 00:12:17,816
Yeah? All right, well, cool.
Let's, uh... do a selfie.

318
00:12:17,841 --> 00:12:20,258
- Give it to me, I'll take it.
- No, no, it's a selfie.

319
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,510
- It's a thing.
- Right. Got it.

320
00:12:22,512 --> 00:12:25,179
(indistinct chatter)

321
00:12:25,181 --> 00:12:26,631
KEVIN: That's gonna turn out great.

322
00:12:26,633 --> 00:12:28,015
- Thank you. (giggles)
- I'm suddenly getting

323
00:12:28,017 --> 00:12:29,717
- why we came here.
- What'd you say?

324
00:12:29,719 --> 00:12:31,552
I said I'm su...

325
00:12:31,554 --> 00:12:33,020
- It's a great place!
- Yeah!

326
00:12:33,022 --> 00:12:35,646
You're... Oh, you got to walk around.

327
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:37,024
Yeah, yeah!

328
00:12:37,026 --> 00:12:38,827
Big table.

329
00:12:39,113 --> 00:12:40,863
He's never been here.

330
00:12:41,948 --> 00:12:43,577
- There he is!
- Hey!

331
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:45,396
Hey, everybody.

332
00:12:45,421 --> 00:12:47,388
Hey, guys.

333
00:12:47,771 --> 00:12:49,444
All right.

334
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:51,923
So, he's got a piece
of egg salad sandwich

335
00:12:51,925 --> 00:12:53,405
dangling from his mustache,

336
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:54,986
riding me about how

337
00:12:55,011 --> 00:12:57,109
- I don't take my job seriously.
- Yeah.

338
00:12:57,134 --> 00:13:00,304
Eventually, I just had to
walk out while he was talking.

339
00:13:02,267 --> 00:13:03,349
Jack.

340
00:13:07,499 --> 00:13:09,724
I forgot to kiss Rebecca
good-bye this morning.

341
00:13:09,726 --> 00:13:11,788
- (chuckling): Oh...
- First time in 15 years.

342
00:13:11,813 --> 00:13:14,111
- Knock, knock.
- Hey, Heather.

343
00:13:14,429 --> 00:13:15,813
Sabatino's?

344
00:13:15,815 --> 00:13:17,064
(sighs) Best in the city.

345
00:13:17,066 --> 00:13:18,816

00:20:34,336 --> 00:20:37,220
(laughter)

522
00:20:37,245 --> 00:20:40,410
Oh, I feel bad they have to
crowd themselves on my account.

523
00:20:40,709 --> 00:20:42,769
I know Annie must be
wanting her room back.

524
00:20:42,794 --> 00:20:45,055
You're not the one who's
cramping anybody's style

525
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,162
in this house.

526
00:20:46,164 --> 00:20:48,636
Okay. My office used to be my haven.

527
00:20:49,293 --> 00:20:51,543
Now, it's Kevin's hamper.

528
00:20:51,568 --> 00:20:52,886
(laughs)

529
00:20:52,911 --> 00:20:53,910
(both laughing)

530
00:20:53,935 --> 00:20:54,968
Yes.

531
00:20:54,993 --> 00:20:56,375
I wish he would leave.

532
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,100
(both laughing)

533
00:21:00,716 --> 00:21:02,515
Compliments of the owner.

534
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,285
Thank you very much, appreciate that.

535
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,238
See? Don't I get the hookup or what?

536
00:21:06,263 --> 00:21:08,062
I haven't done so bad for myself, right?

537
00:21:08,087 --> 00:21:09,129
You're the mayor of free shrimp.

538
00:21:09,154 --> 00:21:10,574
(chuckles)

539
00:21:11,904 --> 00:21:13,465
(sighs)

540
00:21:15,892 --> 00:21:17,574
- All right, so, how's the play going?
- Hmm?

541
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:19,132
- The play.
- Mm.

542
00:21:19,513 --> 00:21:21,012
- It's good. Ha!
- See you still

543
00:21:21,037 --> 00:21:22,027
- working it, Pearson.
- Hey!

544
00:21:22,052 --> 00:21:23,707
Donny frickin' Watson.

545
00:21:23,732 --> 00:21:24,777
What's up, man, how you doing?

546
00:21:24,802 --> 00:21:26,090
- I'm good, I'm good.
- Yeah?

547
00:21:26,115 --> 00:21:27,331
Oh, man, I can't stay.

548
00:21:27,356 --> 00:21:28,683
I got to take my girl to see Cats.

549
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:30,152
She even played
Grizabella in high school.

550
00:21:30,177 --> 00:21:31,605
It's a whole thing but... (chuckles)

551
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:32,465
let's connect soon, yeah?

552
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:33,489
All right, yeah, yeah, yeah,

553
00:21:33,514 --> 00:21:34,652
I'd like that very much.

554
00:21:34,683 --> 00:21:36,285
I'd like that very much.
You're looking good.

555
00:21:36,757 --> 00:21:38,015
Donny Watson.

556
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,206
How you guys know each other?

557
00:21:40,052 --> 00:21:41,558
Funny.

558
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:43,144
(chuckles)

559
00:21:45,255 --> 00:21:46,871
What, are you serious?

560
00:21:48,354 --> 00:21:49,613
- Yeah.
- He...

561
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,210
played my best friend on The Manny.

562
00:21:53,136 --> 00:21:54,652
- Oh!
- Yeah.

563
00:21:54,677 --> 00:21:55,621
Out of context...

564
00:21:55,646 --> 00:21:56,519
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

565
00:21:56,544 --> 00:21:57,824
I must have missed that episode.

566
00:22:03,385 --> 00:22:06,386
He was a series regular,
actually, on the show.

567
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:11,620
For four years, he was a series regular.

568
00:22:18,865 --> 00:22:20,832
Have you ever seen... my show?

569
00:22:20,857 --> 00:22:22,543
- Of course I have. Yeah.
- Yeah?

570
00:22:22,834 --> 00:22:23,916
What was my, uh,

571
00:22:23,941 --> 00:22:25,246
what was my character's name?

572
00:22:25,271 --> 00:22:27,696
Don't tell him. What was my
character's name on the show?

573
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:35,050
(whispering): Wow.

574
00:22:35,075 --> 00:22:36,074
(sighs)

575
00:22:36,099 --> 00:22:37,207
(laughs) Okay.

576
00:22:37,232 --> 00:22:39,316
- Kevin.
- No, no, man, it's all right.

577
00:22:39,341 --> 00:22:41,090
- Just finish the dinner, man.
- It's all right, it's all right,

578
00:22:41,115 --> 00:22:42,147
it's all right.

579
00:22:45,505 --> 00:22:46,894
Good talk.

580
00:22:49,215 --> 00:22:50,348
(Toby laughs)

581
00:22:50,803 --> 00:22:53,300
And so this, uh, dog

582
00:22:53,325 --> 00:22:54,991
just keeps getting reincarnated.

583
00:22:55,016 --> 00:22:57,715
(laughs) And so,

584
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:00,491
and so, it's like he...
I think he's a schna...

585
00:23:00,516 --> 00:23:02,043
like a schnauzer, like,

586
00:23:02,068 --> 00:23:04,818
poodle mix and he's running around town

587
00:23:04,843 --> 00:23:07,832
trying to solve crimes, but
he keeps getting hit by cars.

588
00:23:08,306 --> 00:23:10,121
Yeah, yeah, thank you.

589
00:23:10,146 --> 00:23:10,902
Thank you.

590
00:23:11,026 --> 00:23:12,158
And did you see what happened here?

591
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:13,216
You had chicken.

592
00:23:13,241 --> 00:23:14,340
I had the chicken.

593
00:23:14,365 --> 00:23:15,447
We are in this together.

594
00:23:15,472 --> 00:23:16,721
- Right?
- Thank you.

595
00:23:16,746 --> 00:23:18,136
Would you two like to
see our dessert tray?

596
00:23:18,161 --> 00:23:19,644
Uh, no, thank you.

597
00:23:19,669 --> 00:23:22,003
Walk away, fine sir.

598
00:23:22,766 --> 00:23:24,265
Hey, wait.

599
00:23:24,689 --> 00:23:26,199
He'll have a look.

600
00:23:26,224 --> 00:23:27,363
I will?

601
00:23:27,388 --> 00:23:28,804
Dude, I know you want it,

602
00:23:28,829 --> 00:23:30,829
and if you don't have it
here, you're gonna go home,

603
00:23:30,854 --> 00:23:32,437
you're gonna stuff your face and
you're gonna lie to me about it.

604
00:23:32,462 --> 00:23:33,511
(sighs)

605
00:23:33,536 --> 00:23:34,558
You'll have a full-on

606
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:35,715
food mistress and I...

607
00:23:37,053 --> 00:23:38,887
But I will never love her

608
00:23:38,912 --> 00:23:40,168
(whispering): the way that I love you.

609
00:23:40,193 --> 00:23:41,742
This is not a joke.

610
00:23:41,767 --> 00:23:43,736
- I'm being serious.
- Okay, all right, okay, okay.

611
00:23:43,761 --> 00:23:45,352
How are we gonna make
this relationship work

612
00:23:45,377 --> 00:23:47,816
if we're gonna keep things
from each other? Hmmm?

613
00:23:55,274 --> 00:23:56,774
I'll just have to handle it.

614
00:23:58,047 --> 00:24:00,465
- All right.
- Okay.

615
00:24:16,418 --> 00:24:18,219
(announcer speaks
indistinctly over speakers)

616
00:24:20,808 --> 00:24:23,715
- Hold both at the same time.
- You made it.

617
00:24:24,201 --> 00:24:25,667
- Hi.
- Hi.

618
00:24:26,497 --> 00:24:28,496
(sighs)

619
00:24:28,521 --> 00:24:30,066
What's with, uh, all the beige?

620
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:31,242
(chuckles)

621
00:24:31,267 --> 00:24:32,097
I'm trying to remain neutral.

622
00:24:32,122 --> 00:24:33,668
- Yeah?
- Okay. Yeah.

623
00:24:33,693 --> 00:24:34,942
(chuckles)

624
00:24:36,547 --> 00:24:38,247
Wait, where's Kevin?

625
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:39,402
Uh...

626
00:24:39,427 --> 00:24:40,277
Oh, there he is.

627
00:24:40,302 --> 00:24:41,121
- Twelve.
- Twelve.

628
00:24:41,226 --> 00:24:42,943
Down, set, hut.

629
00:24:47,193 --> 00:24:48,785
Down, set, hut.

630
00:24:53,235 --> 00:24:55,035
Thank you.

ANNOUNCER: We'd like to welcome
tonight's visiting team, Hanes Academy.

632

Now, let's go, McKinley Wildcats.

633
00:24:57,809 --> 00:24:58,840
Rehearsal?

634
00:24:58,865 --> 00:24:59,847
Rehearsal was good?

635
00:24:59,872 --> 00:25:04,066
- Oh, Jack, honestly, it was amazing.
- Yeah?

636
00:25:04,091 --> 00:25:07,125
Yeah, just being on stage again,

637
00:25:07,366 --> 00:25:09,816
and singing and I missed it.

638
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:10,518
Yeah.

639
00:25:10,543 --> 00:25:11,793
The smell of the
microphone alone was...

640
00:25:11,818 --> 00:25:13,067
- The microphone has a smell?
- Hey, Jack!

641
00:25:13,099 --> 00:25:13,808
Hey.

642
00:25:13,833 --> 00:25:15,324
Big game for Kevin, huh?

643
00:25:15,349 --> 00:25:16,504
Yeah, and with your Bobby

644
00:25:16,529 --> 00:25:17,894

thousand dollars right now if you

Street guy, right?

Yeah. Yeah. Okay, but

Uh, you know, you do the-the...
the... like,

The Big Short. You do
the Ponzu schemes.

Oh, dude, it's ponzu
sauce, Ponzi schemes.

689
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,160
Whatever.

690
00:27:10,185 --> 00:27:12,879

693
00:27:18,341 --> 00:27:22,130
Not at first. At first, I was
proud of that show, Randall.

694
00:27:22,155 --> 00:27:23,472
And I invited every single

695
00:27:23,497 --> 00:27:25,144
one of you to tapings.
Kate's the only one that came.

696
00:27:25,169 --> 00:27:26,910
Well, she had to. You were paying her.

697
00:27:28,883 --> 00:27:30,883
Come on, dude. That was funny.

698
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,331
What are you... ?

699
00:27:34,511 --> 00:27:36,667
(Randall laughs)

700
00:27:36,669 --> 00:27:39,704
Now that... that is funny.

701
00:27:39,706 --> 00:27:41,574
That's great.

702
00:27:41,791 --> 00:27:44,144
Replaced by another black man.

703
00:27:44,169 --> 00:27:45,910
What the hell did you just say?

704
00:27:45,952 --> 00:27:47,819
No. "Replaced by another black man."

705
00:27:47,844 --> 00:27:49,379
- Hey, you tell me what that means.
- Don't worry about it, Randall.

706
00:27:49,573 --> 00:27:51,308
No. Please, Kevin. Let's hear it, right?

707
00:27:51,333 --> 00:27:52,730
What are you harboring? 'Cause God knows

708
00:27:52,755 --> 00:27:54,088
I would really love to hear this.

709
00:27:54,113 --> 00:27:55,519
You always got special treatment.

710
00:27:55,544 --> 00:27:56,730
Because I'm black?

711
00:27:56,755 --> 00:27:58,136
No, because you're
black and you're adopted.

712
00:27:58,161 --> 00:28:00,199
Oh, yeah, hit the jackpot
with that combination.

713
00:28:00,224 --> 00:28:02,550
- Couldn't have had it any easier.
- In our house, you did.

714
00:28:02,575 --> 00:28:04,175
- With our mother, you did.
- Oh, right.

715
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,144
- Okay, here we go.
- Why can't you just admit it, man?

716
00:28:06,169 --> 00:28:06,885
Admit what?

717
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:08,737
Just admit that you were more
important to her, and that

718
00:28:08,762 --> 00:28:10,699
she wanted to make sure that you
felt special every single minute

719
00:28:10,724 --> 00:28:12,308
- of every single day so that
- Yeah.

720
00:28:12,333 --> 00:28:14,048
You wouldn't feel like the odd man out.

721
00:28:14,073 --> 00:28:15,323
Well, gee, Kevin, I wonder why

722
00:28:15,325 --> 00:28:16,316
she was worried about
me feeling that way?

723
00:28:16,341 --> 00:28:17,207
What the hell does that mean?

724
00:28:17,232 --> 00:28:19,269
- Just go back to your hotel.
- No. No, hold on.

725
00:28:19,294 --> 00:28:20,911
Randall, hold... No.
What does that mean?

726
00:28:20,936 --> 00:28:23,019
It means you treated me like a dog.

727
00:28:23,236 --> 00:28:26,074
And just like a dog, I kept
coming back again and again,

728
00:28:26,099 --> 00:28:28,511
just hoping for a scrap from you,

729
00:28:28,543 --> 00:28:32,590
like a crumb of affection
or kindness or respect.

730
00:28:32,615 --> 00:28:34,527
- Respect? You wanted my respect?
- Yeah.

731
00:28:34,552 --> 00:28:36,972
Yeah, okay. No, you wanted
to show me up, Randall.

732
00:28:36,997 --> 00:28:39,157
Which is what you did
every single chance you got.

733
00:28:39,182 --> 00:28:40,855
- No, I did not.
- You showed me up!

734
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,130
I'm done with this conversation.

735
00:28:42,155 --> 00:28:43,571
- Done with this conversation?
- In any other family,

736
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:45,396
- I would have been the star!
- Yeah, you know what, bro?

737
00:28:45,421 --> 00:28:48,035
You're no star. That is a star.

738
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,392
Get your hands off me.
Get your hands off me.

739
00:28:49,957 --> 00:28:51,325
You don't push my body.

740
00:28:51,327 --> 00:28:52,693
Don't touch me, okay? Don't touch me.

741
00:28:52,695 --> 00:28:54,074
What is wrong with you?
What is wrong with you?

742
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:55,982
Oh, my God. Don't put
your hands on my body.

743
00:28:56,007 --> 00:28:58,041
(indistinct grunting and mumbling)

744
00:28:58,066 --> 00:29:00,058
(groaning)

745
00:29:00,083 --> 00:29:02,083
Is that... is that the Manny?

746
00:29:02,108 --> 00:29:04,160
Ow! My face...

747
00:29:04,185 --> 00:29:06,485
Kevin? Hey, Kevin?

748
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:08,476
- You're all right, man?
- Hey, Seth.

749
00:29:08,501 --> 00:29:11,465
Do you... want me to call someone?

750
00:29:13,573 --> 00:29:15,972
- Oh. Oh, it's, uh...
- (camera shutter clicks)

751
00:29:16,044 --> 00:29:17,605
No.

752
00:29:19,722 --> 00:29:21,035
This is my brother.

753
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:23,110
Oh. Hey, man.

754
00:29:23,438 --> 00:29:25,020
Hey, Seth Meyers.

755
00:29:25,045 --> 00:29:26,662
- Okay.
- Yeah.

756
00:29:26,687 --> 00:29:29,379
(distant siren wailing)

757
00:29:29,404 --> 00:29:31,788
- No. You know what? Let's go.
- Yeah.

758
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:33,429
I'm still black. Come
on, let's go. Yup, yup.

759
00:29:33,454 --> 00:29:36,019
(grunts) Let's get the hell out of here.

760
00:29:38,348 --> 00:29:41,550
I'm sorry I couldn't help more
with moving the heavy stuff.

761
00:29:41,575 --> 00:29:43,347
That's okay.

762
00:29:45,071 --> 00:29:47,879
Did you know I grew up in a
house with 14 people in it?

763
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:49,160
Hmm.

764
00:29:49,843 --> 00:29:55,425
My parents, four
siblings, aunts, cousins,

765
00:29:56,166 --> 00:29:57,058
three bedrooms.

766
00:29:57,083 --> 00:30:00,254
- How many bathrooms?
- One.

767
00:30:00,602 --> 00:30:02,685
Oh, my gosh,

768
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:05,386
when I was young, all I did
was dream of living alone.

769
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:10,168
- Like some hippie life, you know?
- (chuckles)

770
00:30:10,193 --> 00:30:12,743
Like in some artist loft downtown.

771
00:30:14,059 --> 00:30:15,683
No husband.

772
00:30:16,403 --> 00:30:18,403
Definitely no kids.

773
00:30:19,273 --> 00:30:20,636
So what happened?

774
00:30:20,661 --> 00:30:22,230
I met your damn son.

775
00:30:22,255 --> 00:30:24,847
(laughs) One look in his eyes,

776
00:30:24,872 --> 00:30:27,316
he ruined everything. (laughs)

777
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:33,487
Me, I pretty much always lived alone.

778
00:30:33,512 --> 00:30:35,175
Hmm.

779
00:30:35,961 --> 00:30:37,294
Now I have Randall.

780
00:30:38,472 --> 00:30:39,941
And you.

781
00:30:40,832 --> 00:30:42,244
And the girls

782
00:30:42,246 --> 00:30:45,566
to fall asleep to, wake up to every day.

783
00:30:47,021 --> 00:30:48,894
I hope that's a good thing.

784
00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:50,293
Mostly.

785
00:30:53,288 --> 00:30:55,822
Makes me feel sad to die.

786
00:31:07,617 --> 00:31:10,316
I love it when there's
a new moon like this.

787
00:31:13,457 --> 00:31:16,742
"Splendid against the
night, the searchlights...

788
00:31:17,002 --> 00:31:20,574
BOTH: ... the tracers' arcs,
and the red flare of bombs."

789
00:31:22,441 --> 00:31:23,974
How do you know that?

790
00:31:24,613 --> 00:31:26,621
It's in this book of poems

791
00:31:26,623 --> 00:31:28,925
that Randall's had since he was a baby.

792
00:31:29,277 --> 00:31:32,311
(chuckling): Oh, yeah, that's right.

793
00:31:32,336 --> 00:31:35,284
The one I gave Rebecca back in the day.

794
00:31:39,269 --> 00:31:40,441
Oh.

795
00:31:41,139 --> 00:31:42,566
What?

796
00:31:42,973 --> 00:31:44,769
What'd you say? I'm
feeling a little tired,

797
00:31:44,794 --> 00:31:45,816
Beth, I think I'll...

798
00:31:45,841 --> 00:31:47,374
Oh, hell no, you ain't
cancering your way

799
00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:48,565
out of this one, old man.

800
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:50,030
- (William stammering)
- You better talk.

801
00:31:55,579 --> 00:31:56,912
(warning beeps)

802
00:32:10,601 --> 00:32:12,384
(door chimes)

803
00:32:13,504 --> 00:32:14,703
(alarm chirps)

804
00:32:28,284 --> 00:32:29,583
(plastic bag rustling)

805
00:32:35,875 --> 00:32:38,091
(rustling continues)

806
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:48,464
(sighs)

807
00:33:15,675 --> 00:33:18,256
Get your asses in the car.

808
00:33:18,312 --> 00:33:20,613
We're gonna talk big-time at home.

809
00:33:27,332 --> 00:33:29,382
(engine starts)

810
00:33:59,835 --> 00:34:01,669
You're right.

811
00:34:02,389 --> 00:34:04,005
Mom did favor me.

812
00:34:06,283 --> 00:34:07,918
She did.

813
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,433
Showered me with attention.

814
00:34:10,458 --> 00:34:12,386
Took my side more often than not.

815
00:34:13,992 --> 00:34:15,992
And I ate every bit of her love up.

816
00:34:17,628 --> 00:34:19,324
Ate it up like Pac-Man.

817
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:20,957
(laughs softly)

818
00:34:21,805 --> 00:34:23,082
You know why?

819
00:34:25,643 --> 00:34:28,199
Because the one person
I wanted it from the mo...

820
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:37,987
You know, back there with those people,

821
00:34:38,615 --> 00:34:40,418
it's the first time in 36 years

822
00:34:40,443 --> 00:34:42,910
you've said the words,
"He's my brother."

823
00:34:45,622 --> 00:34:48,373
- Come on, Randall, that can't be...
- Claiming me.

824
00:34:51,086 --> 00:34:52,419
My brother.

825
00:35:05,379 --> 00:35:07,045
Well, then, that really sucks.

826
00:35:15,247 --> 00:35:18,870
Rebecca has known who you
were for Randall's entire life?

827
00:35:18,895 --> 00:35:19,944
Yes, that's right.

828
00:35:19,946 --> 00:35:21,779
And she never told him?

829
00:35:21,781 --> 00:35:23,397
- I don't know, Beth.
- Lied to him,

830
00:35:23,399 --> 00:35:25,184
when he asked. Huh.

831
00:35:25,485 --> 00:35:26,484
I got to tell him.

832
00:35:26,486 --> 00:35:27,485
No. No, no, no, no.

833
00:35:27,487 --> 00:35:28,869
Beth, you can't do that.

834
00:35:28,871 --> 00:35:29,987
Oh, "Beth you can't do that"?

835
00:35:29,989 --> 00:35:31,442
This is my husband.

836
00:35:31,791 --> 00:35:32,873
This is my marriage.

837
00:35:32,875 --> 00:35:35,626
I know, but the closeness
he has with his mom,

838
00:35:35,628 --> 00:35:38,045
you tell him this, it'll destroy it.

839
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,686
(door closes)

840
00:35:45,847 --> 00:35:47,546
Whoa, someone's high.

841
00:35:51,144 --> 00:35:52,512
Good night.

842
00:35:54,117 --> 00:35:56,284
- Night.
- Good night.

843
00:35:58,684 --> 00:36:01,152
Uh...

844
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:03,875
You and my wife got high together?

845
00:36:06,993 --> 00:36:08,801
That's pretty cool.

846
00:36:12,949 --> 00:36:14,949
(chuckles) Good for you.

847
00:36:14,951 --> 00:36:16,784
All right, I'm gonna head up to bed.

848
00:36:16,786 --> 00:36:19,370
Not that way; she moved you.

849
00:36:19,372 --> 00:36:21,422
What do you mean, she moved
me? She moved me where?

850
00:36:31,968 --> 00:36:33,903
(sighs) (laughs)

851
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:36,437
Oh, back in the basement.

852
00:36:36,754 --> 00:36:38,909
- No, we'll move you back upstairs.
- No, come... hey, listen.

853
00:36:38,934 --> 00:36:40,775
I should be getting out
of your hair soon anyway.

854
00:36:40,777 --> 00:36:42,893
You know, until then, this is
actually a pretty sweet set-up.

855
00:36:42,895 --> 00:36:44,145
There's no bathroom down here.

856
00:36:44,147 --> 00:36:45,980
I can walk a flight of stairs.

857
00:36:49,622 --> 00:36:52,214
(sighs) Well, uh... (clicks tongue)

858
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:54,582
- It's been a day.
- Yeah.

859
00:36:55,572 --> 00:36:56,905
Night.

860
00:36:58,044 --> 00:36:59,293
Night.

861
00:37:02,715 --> 00:37:05,216
- Hey, uh, Randall.
- Hmm?

862
00:37:08,471 --> 00:37:10,950
Uh, do you want to...

863
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:13,641
Do you want to hang out down
here for little bit with me?

864
00:37:13,643 --> 00:37:16,590
We could, uh, turn
the TV on or something.

865
00:37:18,645 --> 00:37:20,825
Uh-huh. For a little while.

866
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:22,683
- Yeah?
- Why not?

867
00:37:23,068 --> 00:37:25,202
- Cool.
- Yeah.

868
00:37:33,247 --> 00:37:35,446
Uh, Rebecca, this is Beth.

869
00:37:35,622 --> 00:37:38,870
Yeah, um, so William just told
me something really interesting

870
00:37:38,895 --> 00:37:40,751
about the two of you.

871
00:37:40,753 --> 00:37:44,104
So, yeah, I'm gonna need
you to call me back, okay?

872
00:37:44,129 --> 00:37:45,539
Right away.

873
