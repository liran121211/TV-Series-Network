1
00:00:00,016 --> 00:00:01,366
Previously on This Is Us...

2
00:00:01,368 --> 00:00:03,194
I told you that when I met you,

3
00:00:03,219 --> 00:00:05,304
that I couldn't fall for a fat person.

4
00:00:05,375 --> 00:00:06,858
But you did.

5
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:08,734
So now what?

6
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:10,742
You're just gonna throw me away?

7
00:00:11,242 --> 00:00:12,891
I'm sorry, I can't do this.

8
00:00:14,322 --> 00:00:15,471
Can't do what?

9
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:17,311
When a nice boy who adores you

10
00:00:17,336 --> 00:00:18,836
offers you pie,

11
00:00:18,838 --> 00:00:20,687
say thank you.

12
00:00:20,689 --> 00:00:22,706
RANDALL: Why is there a photo of me

13
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:26,076
in a letter that you sent
to William's apartment?

14
00:00:26,078 --> 00:00:27,945
Randall, you have to understand...

15
00:00:27,947 --> 00:00:30,747
Understand what, that
you knew my father?

16
00:00:30,749 --> 00:00:34,635
That you kept him from
me my entire life?

17
00:00:41,877 --> 00:00:44,995
(voices whispering)

18
00:00:47,283 --> 00:00:50,284
I'm upset, I'm not deaf.

19
00:00:52,939 --> 00:00:55,005
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

20
00:00:55,007 --> 00:00:56,891
I was worried about you.

21
00:00:56,893 --> 00:00:58,209
I'm fine.

22
00:00:58,211 --> 00:01:01,795
- The carpet would beg to differ.
- Mm.

23
00:01:01,797 --> 00:01:03,981
You've been pacing for a few hours now.

24
00:01:03,983 --> 00:01:07,084
You ready to talk?

25
00:01:07,086 --> 00:01:08,702
To William.

26
00:01:08,704 --> 00:01:10,154
You can come in, too, William.

27
00:01:13,868 --> 00:01:16,892
- I know how angry you must be.
- When did you meet my mother?

28
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:20,235
When she took you home
from the hospital.

29
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,585
I wanted to make sure you
weree going to a good home.

30
00:01:24,587 --> 00:01:26,921
RANDALL: Hmm.

31
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:30,524
Did my father know about you?

32
00:01:31,928 --> 00:01:33,544
I never got that impression.

33
00:01:36,999 --> 00:01:38,515
What are you writing, babe?

34
00:01:38,517 --> 00:01:40,467
A list of reasons I'm mad at my mother.

35
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:42,486
I got 22 so far.

36
00:01:42,488 --> 00:01:44,038
And don't think I'm ignoring

37
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,573
the fact that you lied to me, too.

38
00:01:45,575 --> 00:01:47,508
When I showed up at your
door two months ago,

39
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,910
you acted like you didn't
remember abandoning me.

40
00:01:49,912 --> 00:01:51,762
I was respecting your mother's wishes.

41
00:01:51,764 --> 00:01:55,249
Which is why I'm second maddest at you.

42
00:01:55,251 --> 00:01:56,684
You're in third place.

43
00:01:56,686 --> 00:01:58,636
But... I've been trying
to get your mother

44
00:01:58,638 --> 00:02:00,621
to tell you the truth since I found out.

45
00:02:00,623 --> 00:02:03,757
Which is why there isn't
a Beth or William list.

46
00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:05,976
My mother's the one who betrayed me.

47
00:02:05,978 --> 00:02:08,695
And as soon as I'm
finished with this list,

48
00:02:08,697 --> 00:02:10,347
I'm gonna read it to her,

49
00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:13,383
and make sure she hears every damn word.

50
00:02:15,387 --> 00:02:17,271
(music playing over P.A. system)

51
00:02:17,273 --> 00:02:18,755
I'm gonna beat you!

52
00:02:18,757 --> 00:02:21,675
Whoa! Slow do... Slow down.

53
00:02:21,677 --> 00:02:23,277
The deli guy can't believe
we've already gone through

54
00:02:23,279 --> 00:02:24,444
the two pounds of ham and
cheese from last week.

55
00:02:24,446 --> 00:02:25,812
Triplets.

56
00:02:25,814 --> 00:02:27,814
Speaking of, you know
where our third is?

57
00:02:27,816 --> 00:02:29,149
RANDALL: Let me show you again.

58
00:02:29,151 --> 00:02:31,201
Like that. Can you do that?

59
00:02:34,256 --> 00:02:35,372
Sorry. He's with us.

60
00:02:35,374 --> 00:02:36,940
Sorry.

61
00:02:36,942 --> 00:02:38,375
Sorry about that.

62
00:02:38,377 --> 00:02:40,060
What are you doing? What was that, huh?

63
00:02:40,062 --> 00:02:41,929
I asked 'em if they could
roll their tongues.

64
00:02:41,931 --> 00:02:43,230
But, sweetheart, that's not really

65
00:02:43,232 --> 00:02:44,565
something you ask strangers.

66
00:02:44,567 --> 00:02:47,568
We learned about inherited
traits in science,

67
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:49,169
and rolling your tongue is one.

68
00:02:49,171 --> 00:02:51,972
If I can find people
who roll their tongue,

69
00:02:51,974 --> 00:02:54,007
they could be my birth parents.

70
00:02:56,857 --> 00:02:59,474
RANDALL: Excuse me...

71
00:02:59,476 --> 00:03:00,976
Oh...

72
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:04,496
Look, I... I don't
know what to tell him.

73
00:03:04,498 --> 00:03:06,081
I mean, he knows everything that we do.

74
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:08,784
Then there's nothing else to say.

75
00:03:10,804 --> 00:03:12,003
I just... I don't want him

76
00:03:12,005 --> 00:03:13,822
sticking his tongue out at strangers,

77
00:03:13,824 --> 00:03:17,359
you know, when he's 80.

78
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:20,543
It kills me that he'll
always have this hole,

79
00:03:20,545 --> 00:03:22,028
not knowing who his parents are.

80
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,880
We're his parents.

81
00:03:23,882 --> 00:03:25,982
You know what I mean.

82
00:03:27,552 --> 00:03:29,936
(dishes clattering)

83
00:03:31,556 --> 00:03:34,390
Hey, Bec. Hey, sponge down, sponge down.

84
00:03:34,392 --> 00:03:37,026
Look at me a sec.

85
00:03:37,028 --> 00:03:38,928
Look... (sighs)

86
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:41,397
I know this is hard to think about.

87
00:03:41,399 --> 00:03:43,383
It's hard for me, too.

88
00:03:43,385 --> 00:03:44,951
Okay? But he has questions that...

89
00:03:44,953 --> 00:03:46,652
they're not gonna go away.

90
00:03:46,654 --> 00:03:48,287
I just, I don't want him resenting us...

91
00:03:48,289 --> 00:03:49,739
For what, Jack?

92
00:03:49,741 --> 00:03:52,692
We love him, we give him
absolutely everything

93
00:03:52,694 --> 00:03:54,560
he could ever want, what...

94
00:03:54,562 --> 00:03:57,196
would he be missing from us?

95
00:03:57,198 --> 00:03:59,782
We can't roll our tongues.

96
00:04:04,572 --> 00:04:06,072
I can.

97
00:04:07,442 --> 00:04:08,770
- You can roll your tongue?
- I can roll my tongue.

98
00:04:08,795 --> 00:04:11,045
Roll your tongue. Just...

99
00:04:16,518 --> 00:04:18,000
(laughing): Babe...

100
00:04:18,002 --> 00:04:19,819
- Am I doing it?
- It's so sad.

101
00:04:19,821 --> 00:04:21,304
- I'm not doing it?
- You're not rolling your tongue.

102
00:04:21,306 --> 00:04:24,323
- But I can show you. Yeah.
- You can show me?

103
00:04:27,929 --> 00:04:31,147
Mom never told him that she
knew his biological dad?

104
00:04:31,149 --> 00:04:32,398
I know.

105
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,983
That's cuckoo's nest-level insane.

106
00:04:33,985 --> 00:04:35,785
Well, what about you?

107
00:04:35,787 --> 00:04:37,370
Showing up all of a
sudden, deciding to get

108
00:04:37,372 --> 00:04:38,938
your stomach cut open... what is that?

109
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,741
Uh, I almost died in a
plane crash, Kevin.

110
00:04:41,743 --> 00:04:44,544
Okay? My life flashed before my eyes.

111
00:04:44,546 --> 00:04:45,995
Kate, you experienced mild turbulence.

112
00:04:45,997 --> 00:04:47,230
All right? You spilled your peanuts.

113
00:04:47,232 --> 00:04:49,866
It was scary. Shut up.

114
00:04:49,868 --> 00:04:54,654
It was a real "seize the day"
kind of awakening for me.

115
00:04:54,656 --> 00:04:56,989
Yeah? Okay, well, what
happened to dieting?

116
00:04:56,991 --> 00:05:00,660
I don't know, I ran the numbers, and...
(scoffs)

117
00:05:00,662 --> 00:05:02,562
at this rate, I would be 106 years old

118
00:05:02,564 --> 00:05:04,964
by the time I reach my goal weight.

119
00:05:04,966 --> 00:05:07,617
- So I, you know, I want to live now.
- Yeah?

120
00:05:07,619 --> 00:05:09,285
- Yeah.
- Does this have anything to do

121
00:05:09,287 --> 00:05:10,536
with your breakup with Toby?

122
00:05:10,538 --> 00:05:12,321
No. I'm fine.

123
00:05:12,323 --> 00:05:13,890
You know, millions of people

124
00:05:13,892 --> 00:05:15,675
have surgery every day...
it's not a big deal.

125
00:05:15,677 --> 00:05:17,577
It's not a big deal?
No, it's one of about

126
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:19,712
a billion big deals swirling
around in my head right now.

127
00:05:19,714 --> 00:05:21,197
Kate, I've got you, I've got Randall,

128
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,431
Mom's selling the cabin,

129
00:05:22,433 --> 00:05:23,382
I just had the single greatest kiss

130
00:05:23,384 --> 00:05:25,351
- of my entire life...
- Whoa.

131
00:05:25,353 --> 00:05:27,720
Mom's selling the cabin?

132
00:05:27,722 --> 00:05:29,121
Yeah, I found out yesterday.

133
00:05:29,123 --> 00:05:31,257
It sucks, right? She can't do...

134
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:34,560
I love the cabin. The
cabin is our childhood.

135
00:05:34,562 --> 00:05:36,896
I know, but we haven't been
there in years, right?

136
00:05:36,898 --> 00:05:39,532
Well, let's go. We should.

137
00:05:39,534 --> 00:05:41,350
Like, let's seize the day.

138
00:05:41,352 --> 00:05:42,852
Hey, have you guys seen...
Oh, there it is.

139
00:05:42,854 --> 00:05:43,903
Ran out of paper.

140
00:05:45,507 --> 00:05:48,374
You know where I bet
there is a ton of paper?

141
00:05:48,376 --> 00:05:50,309
Where?

142
00:05:53,932 --> 00:05:56,265
(Randall sighs)

143
00:05:56,267 --> 00:05:59,652
Can't believe Mom is selling this place.

144
00:05:59,654 --> 00:06:01,888
I got a lot of "can't
believes" with Mom.

145
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,189
You know what I can't believe?

146
00:06:03,191 --> 00:06:04,590
That we are in the middle of nowhere,

147
00:06:04,592 --> 00:06:05,591
and all my messages are going through.

148
00:06:05,593 --> 00:06:07,076
Do I have wifi in my car?

149
00:06:07,078 --> 00:06:09,045
No.

150
00:06:09,047 --> 00:06:10,530
No wifi. I'm living in the past.

151
00:06:10,532 --> 00:06:12,148
I'm not. Not anymore.

152
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,966
Listen, man, I know you're hurting,

153
00:06:13,968 --> 00:06:15,968
but you and Mom are gonna have
to make up eventually, okay?

154
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:18,170
Hopefully before Christmas,
so that holiday isn't ruined.

155
00:06:18,172 --> 00:06:20,389
Nope. I'm gonna clear out my stuff,

156
00:06:20,391 --> 00:06:23,409
hand over my keys, then I
am out of the whole thing.

157
00:06:23,411 --> 00:06:25,995
- Ha! That's funny.
- (cell phone chimes)

158
00:06:25,997 --> 00:06:27,964
With the language barrier,
sometimes Olivia's funnier

159
00:06:27,966 --> 00:06:30,616
than she means to be.

160
00:06:30,618 --> 00:06:33,302
- She's British. She speaks English.
- Yes.

161
00:06:40,678 --> 00:06:42,562
RANDALL: Never understood
why Mom felt like we needed

162
00:06:42,564 --> 00:06:44,497
three locks on this door.

163
00:06:44,499 --> 00:06:46,365
It's because Kev was afraid of bears.

164
00:06:46,367 --> 00:06:50,202
Hey, Zoobooks said they're smart.

165
00:06:50,204 --> 00:06:52,171
RANDALL: Not this smart.

166
00:06:52,173 --> 00:06:53,573
Forgive me for not
learning in high school.

167
00:06:53,575 --> 00:06:55,174
I was having sex, Randall.

168
00:07:11,092 --> 00:07:12,775
Uh...

169
00:07:14,896 --> 00:07:18,047
Ah, so much denim on denim. Look.

170
00:07:18,049 --> 00:07:20,933
I can't look now, I'm busy.

171
00:07:20,935 --> 00:07:23,235
Oh, you still can't see the Magic Eye?

172
00:07:23,237 --> 00:07:25,304
- Uh... yeah.
- Look, you just gotta relax your eyes.

173
00:07:25,306 --> 00:07:27,740
- Yeah.
- Look through it, and it's right...

174
00:07:27,742 --> 00:07:28,975
Right there in front of you, I know.

175
00:07:28,977 --> 00:07:30,626
That's what Dad always used to say,

176
00:07:30,628 --> 00:07:31,978
but I can't see it...
it's a pirate ship!

177
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,129
It's always been a bear, dude.

178
00:07:33,131 --> 00:07:34,280
But you know what?

179
00:07:34,282 --> 00:07:36,682
Maybe it was never real, anyway.

180
00:07:36,684 --> 00:07:38,769
Just like the rest of my childhood.

181
00:07:39,203 --> 00:07:41,787
Randall... What Mom did was insane,

182
00:07:41,789 --> 00:07:43,689
but that doesn't erase your childhood.

183
00:07:43,691 --> 00:07:45,992
- Me and Kev are real.
- (Kevin chuckles)

184
00:07:45,994 --> 00:07:48,461
Okay? Our family... we're real.

185
00:07:48,463 --> 00:07:50,429
Yeah. Come here.

186
00:07:50,431 --> 00:07:51,597
- No, come look at this.
- All right.

187
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,834
Come on, indulge us. Sit down.

188
00:07:54,836 --> 00:07:56,919
Look at this. Look.

189
00:07:56,921 --> 00:07:59,271
We're all here. You're here.

190
00:07:59,273 --> 00:08:01,240
Grinning ear to ear in
our elastic waistband,

191
00:08:01,242 --> 00:08:02,558
acid-washed jeans.

192
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,577
Those jeans were real!

193
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:06,445
All right, here. Let me see.

194
00:08:06,447 --> 00:08:08,748
- Look at this. Right there?
- KATE: Mm-hmm.

195
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,716
That's Mom lying to me
about not being able

196
00:08:10,718 --> 00:08:12,618
to find my birth father.

197
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,671
- Okay.
- That's awesome.

198
00:08:15,673 --> 00:08:18,474
You're right. I-I'm sorry.

199
00:08:18,476 --> 00:08:20,376
But this is probably
gonna be the last time

200
00:08:20,378 --> 00:08:22,978
that the three of us are
ever gonna be here.

201
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,953
So can we just enjoy today?

202
00:08:24,955 --> 00:08:27,673
Please?

203
00:08:27,675 --> 00:08:29,441
(car pulling up)

204
00:08:29,443 --> 00:08:32,227
What's that? I'll get it.

205
00:08:34,148 --> 00:08:35,664
Hey.

206
00:08:37,735 --> 00:08:39,635
KEVIN: Hey...

207
00:08:39,637 --> 00:08:41,070
you made it!

208
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:46,425
You all made it. Oh. Huh.

209
00:08:46,427 --> 00:08:48,410
Are you kidding me?

210
00:08:48,412 --> 00:08:50,462
- What do you think?
- Yeah.

211
00:08:54,018 --> 00:08:55,501
It's not a bear.

212
00:08:55,503 --> 00:08:58,053
Oh. Good to know.

213
00:08:58,055 --> 00:09:00,973
This place is so quaint.

214
00:09:00,975 --> 00:09:02,441
KEVIN: Yeah, right?

215
00:09:02,443 --> 00:09:05,210
Oh, my God. (chuckles)

216
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:07,346
This looks absurd.

217
00:09:13,938 --> 00:09:15,771
Hey, what's up?

218
00:09:15,773 --> 00:09:17,573
This was supposed to be our day.

219
00:09:17,575 --> 00:09:20,025
What? No, I mean, you know, I
told her that we were here.

220
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:21,276
I told her she could come. I
didn't know she was gonna

221
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:23,162
bring our playwright and some dude.

222
00:09:23,164 --> 00:09:24,897
This guy is wearing
suspenders over a thermal.

223
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:26,131
Like, what... what is that?

224
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:27,733
These are my people now, Kate.

225
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:30,619
He's an artist. He's authentic.

226
00:09:30,621 --> 00:09:32,471
(scoffs) I'm sorry, I love you,

227
00:09:32,473 --> 00:09:33,639
but I want to punch you.

228
00:09:33,641 --> 00:09:34,823
Okay, can you do me a favor?

229
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:36,625
Can you please just give them a chance?

230
00:09:36,627 --> 00:09:38,444
- I really want you to like Olivia.
- ASHER: Hey, hey.

231
00:09:38,446 --> 00:09:39,611
We brought some nosh and some liquid.

232
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:41,413
Cool if I just put it
here in the fridge?

233
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:42,648
KEVIN: Yeah, just, you
know, throw it in there.

234
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:43,799
Right on. It's for everyone.

235
00:09:43,801 --> 00:09:44,967
(whispering): That is weird.

236
00:09:44,969 --> 00:09:46,485
(whispering): It's nice.

237
00:09:46,487 --> 00:09:48,470
Man. Rad cabin, by the way.

238
00:09:48,472 --> 00:09:50,973
Whew, Norman Rockwell?

239
00:09:50,975 --> 00:09:52,925
He would have really lost
his mind in this place.

240
00:09:52,927 --> 00:09:54,927
Thanks.

241
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:57,546
Yeah, that's nice of you.

242
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:01,767
I can't tear 'em away from that Atari.

243
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:03,385
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

244
00:10:03,387 --> 00:10:05,204
I'll give my boys another five.

245
00:10:05,206 --> 00:10:09,441
- I'm feeling generous today.
- (chuckles) Okay.

246
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:11,760
Hey, so has Randall asked you

247
00:10:11,762 --> 00:10:14,546
if you can roll your tongue?

248
00:10:14,548 --> 00:10:16,615
No. He supposed to?

249
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:18,584
(Jack sighs) He's been asking people,

250
00:10:18,586 --> 00:10:21,153
hoping to trace that trait
across the whole city

251
00:10:21,155 --> 00:10:22,701
to see if he can find his birth parents.

252
00:10:22,726 --> 00:10:25,908
And we told him we can't
find his biological parents,

253
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,075
and he understands that, so...

254
00:10:27,077 --> 00:10:29,061
YVETTE: Oh, okay.

255
00:10:29,063 --> 00:10:32,080
At least, now, I get it.

256
00:10:32,082 --> 00:10:34,416
He's been telling my
boys different stories

257
00:10:34,418 --> 00:10:36,485
about who his father might be.

258
00:10:36,487 --> 00:10:38,704
He has? Hmm. Like what?

259
00:10:38,706 --> 00:10:40,706
Oh, he makes up different things.

260
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,875
Sometimes a cook. Basketball player.

261
00:10:42,877 --> 00:10:44,309
Once he was the mailman.

262
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,044
And it's...

263
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:48,280
- just stories about his father?
- YVETTE: Oh,

264
00:10:48,282 --> 00:10:50,215
just stop it, Jack. Okay?
Think about it.

265
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:52,201
Cook. Basketball player.

266
00:10:52,203 --> 00:10:54,036
Your mailman. Is he white?

267
00:10:54,038 --> 00:10:56,455
No.

268
00:10:56,457 --> 00:10:57,906
No. He's black.

269
00:10:57,908 --> 00:11:00,976
It sounds like he may be picking jobs

270
00:11:00,978 --> 00:11:02,828
that he's seen black men do.

271
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,897
Like he's looking for someone

272
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:07,449
he sees himself in.

273
00:11:07,451 --> 00:11:09,701
(inhales)

274
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:11,687
I think he may need

275
00:11:11,689 --> 00:11:13,705
black male role models.

276
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:15,908
Men who can show him

277
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:18,443
who he might grow into.

278
00:11:21,165 --> 00:11:22,464

If only Gertrude Stein had one of these

282
00:11:28,606 --> 00:11:32,090
- in her Paris salon.
- Yeah. I know, totally.

283
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:34,093
Cliché, right? I always
hated playing this game.

284
00:11:34,118 --> 00:11:34,760
KATE: Uh...

285
00:11:34,762 --> 00:11:37,196
- What? You liked it more than I did.
- I did not like it more than you.

286
00:11:37,198 --> 00:11:38,964
- Don't say that. I didn't.
- You sh...

287
00:11:38,966 --> 00:11:40,582
- Randall, come take a break. Come spin.
- Hmm?

288
00:11:40,584 --> 00:11:41,700
Wait. Shh.

289
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:43,669
You hear that?

290
00:11:43,671 --> 00:11:45,404
It sounds like...

291
00:11:45,406 --> 00:11:47,172
clicking. What is that?

292
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:49,908
(panting)

293
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,577
KEVIN: I don't hear anything.

294
00:11:51,579 --> 00:11:53,779
(door opens) Randall?

295
00:11:53,781 --> 00:11:55,464
Okay. Uh...

296
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:57,683
He was never any fun to
play with anyway., so...

297
00:11:57,685 --> 00:11:59,368
- Anybody need anything from the kitchen?
- KEVIN: I'm good.

298
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:00,986
- I think it's your turn.
- Spin for me,

299
00:12:00,988 --> 00:12:03,038

S... So, is that Liv, like Olivia?

303
00:12:13,801 --> 00:12:16,535
I leave an impression on people I date.

304
00:12:16,537 --> 00:12:18,503
Oh.

305
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:19,771
Wow.

306
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:22,441
- O-Okay.
- Okay. Okay.

307
00:12:22,443 --> 00:12:24,476
Okay. All right. It's your turn.

308
00:12:24,478 --> 00:12:26,712

309

You brought your ex to our family cabin?

00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,650
Look, Kate, it's fine. I mean,

311
00:12:31,652 --> 00:12:33,835
everyone's got exes, right?
It's... It's okay.

312
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:36,355

happened to my smoothie?

It was supposed to last all day.

315
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:41,410

mushrooms in it,

00:21:49,121 --> 00:21:51,138
That if I let up for a moment,

532
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:54,091
I will remember that I am unwanted.

533
00:21:54,093 --> 00:21:55,926
And then what'll happen to me?

534
00:21:57,597 --> 00:21:58,913
Stop.

535
00:21:58,915 --> 00:22:00,364
Randall. Hey, you come here.

536
00:22:00,366 --> 00:22:01,549
Hmm? Stop.

537
00:22:01,551 --> 00:22:04,435
The moment I saw you,

538
00:22:04,437 --> 00:22:07,371
I knew you were my boy.

539
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:13,160
You weren't a choice,
Randall, you were a fact.

540
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,213
You were never a replacement, son.

541
00:22:16,215 --> 00:22:17,464
Do you understand?

542
00:22:21,153 --> 00:22:22,553
If I had known

543
00:22:22,555 --> 00:22:25,439
that the man who abandoned
me regretted it...

544
00:22:25,441 --> 00:22:29,109
that he wanted me back...

545
00:22:29,111 --> 00:22:32,463
that would've made all the
difference in the world.

546
00:22:34,216 --> 00:22:37,334
(three distinct clicks)

547
00:22:37,336 --> 00:22:40,504
- I'm sorry that she lied to you.
- (inhales)

548
00:22:40,506 --> 00:22:44,291
But we can't change that, so
what do you want to do now?

549
00:22:45,745 --> 00:22:47,745
(three distinct clicks)

550
00:22:49,248 --> 00:22:51,282
(three distinct clicks)

551
00:22:53,202 --> 00:22:55,686
(indistinct shouting, laughter)

552
00:23:00,176 --> 00:23:02,643
JACK: You gotta go for it, go for it.

553
00:23:02,645 --> 00:23:05,062
Oh! Whoa! Big roll!

554
00:23:05,064 --> 00:23:06,480
Big roll.

555
00:23:06,482 --> 00:23:09,450
I want her to hurt as much as I do.

556
00:23:09,452 --> 00:23:12,369
(indistinct chatter)

557
00:23:12,371 --> 00:23:16,940
Been working at a little music
shop, in the back room,

558
00:23:16,942 --> 00:23:20,027
you know, cleaning and, uh,
repairing instruments.

559
00:23:20,029 --> 00:23:22,062
It keeps me busy.

560
00:23:22,064 --> 00:23:24,632
Although it keeps my hands cracked, too.

561
00:23:24,634 --> 00:23:26,634
(chuckles)

562
00:23:26,636 --> 00:23:29,620
A friend from N.A. got me the job.

563
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,706
N.A.?

564
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:34,725
Narcotics Anonymous.

565
00:23:34,727 --> 00:23:37,478
Been clean for over five years.

566
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,712
Wow.

567
00:23:38,714 --> 00:23:40,114
That's great.

568
00:23:40,116 --> 00:23:42,516
That's really good for you.

569
00:23:44,704 --> 00:23:46,620
How is he? Kyle?

570
00:23:46,622 --> 00:23:49,590
Oh, um...

571
00:23:49,592 --> 00:23:53,844
we... we changed his name, actually.

572
00:23:53,846 --> 00:23:56,830
To Randall.

573
00:23:56,832 --> 00:23:58,832
After Dudley Randall.

574
00:24:01,504 --> 00:24:04,788
Dudley Randall.

575
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:06,306
How's Randall, then?

576
00:24:06,308 --> 00:24:08,275
He's good.

577
00:24:08,277 --> 00:24:09,843
He is, um...

578
00:24:09,845 --> 00:24:12,312
(clears throat)

579
00:24:12,314 --> 00:24:14,782
He's really smart, very smart.

580
00:24:14,784 --> 00:24:16,650
He loves math and science,

581
00:24:16,652 --> 00:24:19,720
- he loves G.I. Joe, he...
- (chuckles)

582
00:24:19,722 --> 00:24:24,591
My... my husband went out
of town for work last month

583
00:24:24,593 --> 00:24:26,360
and it was for the first time

584
00:24:26,362 --> 00:24:29,079
he's ever been away from
home for the night.

585
00:24:29,081 --> 00:24:32,566
And Randall slept in my bed with me.

586
00:24:32,568 --> 00:24:34,435
Not because he was scared,

587
00:24:34,437 --> 00:24:36,987
but because he didn't
want me to be scared.

588
00:24:36,989 --> 00:24:38,956
He's a sweet boy.

589
00:24:38,958 --> 00:24:42,176
He is a very, very sweet boy.

590
00:24:42,178 --> 00:24:43,394
(chuckles)

591
00:24:46,782 --> 00:24:48,148
(car horn honks in distance)

592
00:24:52,388 --> 00:24:54,204
Spent the last nine years wondering

593
00:24:54,206 --> 00:24:56,390
if I did the right thing.

594
00:24:56,392 --> 00:24:58,409
But I didn't even know

595
00:24:58,411 --> 00:25:01,395
your last name to look you
up in the phone book.

596
00:25:04,934 --> 00:25:07,234
Seems like it was right, though.

597
00:25:09,338 --> 00:25:12,072
For him.

598
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:20,180
He's, um...

599
00:25:20,182 --> 00:25:22,883
he's been asking about you.

600
00:25:24,954 --> 00:25:29,556
He really... wants to meet his father.

601
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,244
And so that's why I'm here.

602
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:39,032
My boy wants to meet me?

603
00:25:41,787 --> 00:25:45,088
Uh, maybe you can bring him
by the store sometime.

604
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:46,440
Maybe.

605
00:25:46,442 --> 00:25:48,625
But I... Is he musical at all?

606
00:25:48,627 --> 00:25:50,294
No.

607
00:25:50,296 --> 00:25:52,279
Maybe I can, uh, teach him some things.

608
00:25:52,281 --> 00:25:53,480
Hold on, I want to show you something.

609
00:25:53,482 --> 00:25:54,715
Well...

610
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,187
I know this isn't no Ritz-Carlton,

611
00:26:00,189 --> 00:26:01,672
but he'd be welcome,

612
00:26:01,674 --> 00:26:04,508
you know, to come over any time and...

613
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:07,261
JACK: Hey, why are you
against even trying?

614
00:26:07,263 --> 00:26:08,495
Huh?

615
00:26:16,071 --> 00:26:19,339
Because what if they're great?

616
00:26:19,341 --> 00:26:21,642
What if they regret abandoning him

617
00:26:21,644 --> 00:26:23,243
and they want him back?

618
00:26:23,245 --> 00:26:26,196
Look, no one can take
him away from us, okay?

619
00:26:26,198 --> 00:26:27,781
He is legally our son.

620
00:26:27,783 --> 00:26:30,400
No. No one legally gave him up.

621
00:26:30,402 --> 00:26:31,802
There's not some sort of

622
00:26:31,804 --> 00:26:34,004
fire station paper
trail out there, Jack.

623
00:26:34,006 --> 00:26:36,139
His birth parents could have rights

624
00:26:36,141 --> 00:26:37,691
and I cannot,

625
00:26:37,693 --> 00:26:40,127
I cannot lose my son.

626
00:26:40,129 --> 00:26:42,062
I can't.

627
00:26:44,333 --> 00:26:46,767
WILLIAM: could get a cot

628
00:26:46,769 --> 00:26:48,235
if he wanted to stay over.

629
00:26:48,237 --> 00:26:49,803
Keep me from bein' scared at night, too.

630
00:26:49,805 --> 00:26:51,205
Here it is.

631
00:26:51,207 --> 00:26:53,457
Seen better days, but...

632
00:26:53,459 --> 00:26:54,691
Rebecca?

633
00:27:05,795 --> 00:27:07,946
- Oh.
- Sorry. Hi. I'm not, uh, hiding

634
00:27:07,948 --> 00:27:09,865
or looking through
stuff, I'm just trying

635
00:27:09,867 --> 00:27:11,061
to get a signal. That's all right.

636
00:27:11,086 --> 00:27:13,485
I'm just here to get a sweater;
Olivia said she's cold, so...

637
00:27:15,623 --> 00:27:18,240
Hey, let me ask you, uh...

638
00:27:18,335 --> 00:27:20,285
speaking of Olivia, what's
the deal with her and Asher?

639
00:27:20,287 --> 00:27:21,486
Oh.

640
00:27:21,488 --> 00:27:23,321
I hate her.

641
00:27:23,323 --> 00:27:25,223
I truly hate her.

642
00:27:25,225 --> 00:27:27,508
- You hate Olivia?
- Mm-hmm.

643
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:29,210
I rented a car to drive to Albany

644
00:27:29,212 --> 00:27:32,063
because my sister Elise
went into labor last night

645
00:27:32,065 --> 00:27:35,016
and she knew I had it and
asked me to take her here.

646
00:27:35,018 --> 00:27:37,302
And I said yes, because
she's the star of my play

647
00:27:37,304 --> 00:27:39,921
and I need her to like me.

648
00:27:39,923 --> 00:27:42,557
She wanted an "authentic
cabin experience."

649
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,193
You know where I have always dreamed

650
00:27:45,195 --> 00:27:47,378
about taking my soon-to-be-born
niece someday?

651
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:49,030
Epcot.

652
00:27:49,032 --> 00:27:50,732
It's my favorite place in the world

653
00:27:50,734 --> 00:27:52,717
and there's nothing more inauthentic

654
00:27:52,719 --> 00:27:56,170
than their perfectly clean,
crime-free versions of

655
00:27:56,172 --> 00:27:58,356
international cities.

656
00:27:58,358 --> 00:28:01,092
I love inauthentic!

657
00:28:01,094 --> 00:28:03,111
(sighs heavily)

658
00:28:03,113 --> 00:28:04,829
I'm sorry.

659
00:28:04,831 --> 00:28:06,047
I shouldn't be talking
to you about this.

660
00:28:06,049 --> 00:28:07,732
No. Um...

661
00:28:07,734 --> 00:28:10,184
Your cabin is really nice.

662
00:28:10,186 --> 00:28:11,436
Thank you.

663
00:28:11,438 --> 00:28:12,870
I like this thing.

664
00:28:12,872 --> 00:28:16,608
I made something like it at camp once.

665
00:28:18,011 --> 00:28:20,929
Is, uh... congratulations on your niece.

666
00:28:20,931 --> 00:28:22,630
That's... awesome.

667
00:28:22,632 --> 00:28:24,866
So... Thank you.

668
00:28:28,104 --> 00:28:29,871
(line ringing)

669
00:28:29,873 --> 00:28:32,257
TOBY: Hello?

670
00:28:32,259 --> 00:28:33,858
Hi.

671
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:36,728
I... I didn't think you
were gonna pick up.

672
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:39,964
Yeah. Uh... me neither.

673
00:28:39,966 --> 00:28:41,733
(chuckles)

674
00:28:41,735 --> 00:28:44,452
I know I shouldn't be calling
you, but... (exhales)

675
00:28:44,454 --> 00:28:47,505
my God, Randall is seeing things,

676
00:28:47,507 --> 00:28:49,924
Kevin has his head up his
ass and his girlfriend...

677
00:28:49,926 --> 00:28:51,526
oh, my God, she is,
like, this she-demon.

678
00:28:51,528 --> 00:28:53,127
I don't even know where she's from.

679
00:28:53,129 --> 00:28:54,512
See? And you thought the cabin

680
00:28:54,514 --> 00:28:55,830
wouldn't be like a horror movie.

681
00:28:55,832 --> 00:28:58,416
(chuckling): Yeah.

682
00:29:01,705 --> 00:29:04,889
Well, I'm, uh, sorry
you're having a hard day.

683
00:29:04,891 --> 00:29:07,458
But are we still broken up?

684
00:29:09,029 --> 00:29:10,928
Well, yeah.

685
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:15,350
Well, then I can't be this
person for you anymore, Kate.

686
00:29:15,352 --> 00:29:16,851
I'm sorry.

687
00:29:16,853 --> 00:29:18,903
Good-bye.

688
00:29:18,905 --> 00:29:20,305
(phone beeps)

689
00:29:24,511 --> 00:29:26,861
For our next talent show act,

690
00:29:26,863 --> 00:29:29,681
- I will be performing "Time After Time."
- OLIVIA: Bless her. Aw.

691
00:29:29,683 --> 00:29:31,349
- (laughs)
- (Olivia giggles)

692
00:29:31,351 --> 00:29:32,550
Oh, my God, look at her.

693
00:29:32,552 --> 00:29:33,634
REBECCA: I love that song, sweetie.

694
00:29:33,636 --> 00:29:35,737
Hey!

695
00:29:35,739 --> 00:29:37,605
- ♪ Everybody Wang Chung tonight! ♪
- OLIVIA: Oh, my God.

696
00:29:37,607 --> 00:29:40,925
Ash, you've got to try this squash.
So good.

697
00:29:40,927 --> 00:29:42,293
KEVIN: You were taking too long
and I don't like your song!

698
00:29:42,295 --> 00:29:43,628
- ASHER: Mm. So good.
- OLIVIA: Right?

699
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:44,829
- KATE: Cyndi Lauper rules!
- Mmm. Mmm.

700
00:29:44,831 --> 00:29:46,681
I mean, this? Her?

701
00:29:46,683 --> 00:29:48,499
- Don't tell your brother to shut up.
- This is...

702
00:29:48,501 --> 00:29:50,501
- Why don't you sing a song together?
- this is everything.

703
00:29:50,503 --> 00:29:52,186
OLIVIA: Super cute.

704
00:29:52,188 --> 00:29:53,371
- KEVIN: No, you don't!
- Okay, I...

705
00:29:53,373 --> 00:29:54,522
KATE: Yes, I do!

706
00:29:54,524 --> 00:29:56,808
(video shuts off)

707
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:58,543
What the hell's going on over there?

708
00:29:58,545 --> 00:29:59,711
Huh?

709
00:29:59,713 --> 00:30:01,612
First of all, Ash,
