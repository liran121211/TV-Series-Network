00:00:08,602 --> 00:00:10,477
- Baby?
- Something's not right.

3
00:00:10,547 --> 00:00:12,006
We lost the third baby, Jack.

4
00:00:12,031 --> 00:00:13,237
I'm very sorry.

5
00:00:13,273 --> 00:00:17,577
I like to think that you took the
sourest lemon that life has to offer

6
00:00:17,602 --> 00:00:20,023
and turned it into something
resembling lemonade.

7
00:00:20,109 --> 00:00:24,672
36 years ago, my life started with you
leaving me on a fire station doorstep.

8
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:26,791
Beth, The man has stage
IV stomach cancer.

9
00:00:26,826 --> 00:00:28,280
Why you watching this stuff?

10
00:00:28,305 --> 00:00:29,455
Told them to go screw themselves.

11
00:00:29,507 --> 00:00:30,990
I'm moving to New York.

00:00:31,025 --> 00:00:32,424

This is the scariest part.

37
00:02:16,659 --> 00:02:20,644
Some people think the scariest part is
coming to the hospital to have the baby.

38
00:02:20,679 --> 00:02:25,649
Nah. The scariest part
is leaving the hospital with the baby.

39
00:02:25,701 --> 00:02:28,719
Babies. Babies, of course.

40
00:02:28,754 --> 00:02:31,705
Doc, these two, they only fall asleep
if they're next to each other.

41
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,540
Is that unusual?

42
00:02:33,576 --> 00:02:35,542
Well, they've been
sharing the same hot tub

43
00:02:35,544 --> 00:02:37,194
the last nine months; you can't
bust them up right away.

44
00:02:37,246 --> 00:02:38,729
No, I'm not concerned.

45
00:02:38,764 --> 00:02:41,448
Did she tell you what we named them?

46
00:02:41,483 --> 00:02:43,500
No, actually, she didn't.

47
00:02:43,535 --> 00:02:45,152
You can go ahead and tell him, babe.

48
00:02:45,187 --> 00:02:49,089
Kevin, Kate and Kyle.
All Ks.

49
00:02:49,124 --> 00:02:50,340
It's a good letter.

50
00:02:50,376 --> 00:02:53,977
We had a good doctor.
Right, Bec?

51
00:02:54,013 --> 00:02:57,798
I'm sorry.
I'm just, um, a little overwhelmed.

52
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,700
Thank you very much for everything.

53
00:03:02,838 --> 00:03:06,907
TESS: Grandma and Grandpa are here!

54
00:03:06,942 --> 00:03:07,908
- Hi, Grandpa.
- RANDALL: Hey.

55
00:03:07,943 --> 00:03:09,126
Hi, baby.

56
00:03:09,161 --> 00:03:11,295
RANDALL: What are you guys doing here?

57
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,097
We were on our way into the city
and thought we'd stop by and say hi.

58
00:03:14,133 --> 00:03:15,949
A friend at work gave us
his Hamilton tickets.

59
00:03:15,985 --> 00:03:17,718
Feel like I'm gonna be the one person

60
00:03:17,753 --> 00:03:20,187
on the planet who doesn't
like this damn thing.

61
00:03:20,222 --> 00:03:22,255
There's a man living with us. What?

62
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:23,857
Daddy's friend from work.

63
00:03:23,859 --> 00:03:25,792
Come play Legos!

64
00:03:25,828 --> 00:03:28,028
Yeah, come play Legos with us.

65
00:03:28,063 --> 00:03:29,429
REBECCA: We're coming, we're coming.

66
00:03:29,465 --> 00:03:31,231
GIRLS: Yay!

67
00:03:31,266 --> 00:03:32,349
REBECCA (kissing): I missed you.

68
00:03:33,585 --> 00:03:35,552
This was not the plan.

69
00:03:35,587 --> 00:03:37,070
What plan?

70
00:03:37,106 --> 00:03:39,022
The plan for how I was gonna
tell her that I found him.

71
00:03:39,074 --> 00:03:40,340
I wasn't aware there was
a plan for that, babe.

72
00:03:40,342 --> 00:03:41,525
Well, there was.

73
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,010
I mean, there was gonna be.

74
00:03:43,045 --> 00:03:45,679
The plan was forming, but now it's off.

75
00:03:45,714 --> 00:03:47,597
Okay, so what are you gonna do now?

76
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,416
- Uh, right now?
- Mm-hmm.

77
00:03:49,468 --> 00:03:52,552
I'm gonna put on a fake-ass smile.

78
00:03:52,554 --> 00:03:55,355
I'm gonna ask to speak
to my mother privately.

79
00:03:55,357 --> 00:03:57,290
And then I'm gonna tell her something

80
00:03:57,326 --> 00:03:59,860
that's gonna completely and
utterly devastate her.

81
00:04:01,363 --> 00:04:03,146
Mommy?

82
00:04:03,182 --> 00:04:04,715
Can I talk to you privately?

83
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,733
- One second.
- Sure.

84
00:04:12,925 --> 00:04:14,474
(groaning)

85
00:04:14,476 --> 00:04:16,760
Uh, everybody...

86
00:04:16,795 --> 00:04:19,262
(mumbling)

87
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:23,700
Oh, holy hangover, Fatman.

88
00:04:23,736 --> 00:04:26,586

90
00:04:34,663 --> 00:04:36,546
Oh, God.

Oh!

98
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,383
- Ugh.
- How's your face?

99
00:04:56,418 --> 00:04:58,802
(with mouth full): Well, it's fine.

100
00:04:58,837 --> 00:05:01,426
Luckily, I have all this
fat to soften the blow.

101
00:05:01,451 --> 00:05:02,289
Stop that.

102
00:05:02,324 --> 00:05:03,990
How's your breakfast?

103
00:05:04,026 --> 00:05:07,411
You mean this, uh, steel-cut oatmeal

104
00:05:07,446 --> 00:05:09,529
and egg white pancake
with no salt, no sugar,

105
00:05:09,581 --> 00:05:11,198
and no oil that you're making me eat?

106
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,516
Yes.

107
00:05:12,551 --> 00:05:14,117
It's amazing.

108
00:05:14,153 --> 00:05:15,902
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.

109
00:05:15,954 --> 00:05:18,371
It's the best thing I've ever tasted.

110
00:05:18,373 --> 00:05:19,606
(laughs)

111
00:05:19,608 --> 00:05:20,941
Quick question.

112
00:05:20,976 --> 00:05:24,027
Um, last night, after the party...

113
00:05:24,063 --> 00:05:25,595
I kind of blacked out.

114
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,913
We didn't, uh...

115
00:05:26,949 --> 00:05:28,515
Oh, no.

116
00:05:28,517 --> 00:05:30,050
A lot of vomiting

117
00:05:30,085 --> 00:05:32,853
but not a lot of anything else.

118
00:05:32,888 --> 00:05:34,171
Oh. Sexy.

119
00:05:34,206 --> 00:05:36,890
You have an amazing voice, by the way.

120
00:05:36,925 --> 00:05:39,025
I did not know that you sang.

121
00:05:39,061 --> 00:05:41,294
Well, I did not know
that you spy on people

122
00:05:41,346 --> 00:05:42,529
in the bathroom.

123
00:05:42,581 --> 00:05:43,764
(chuckles)

124
00:05:43,766 --> 00:05:45,382
Will you sing for me?

125
00:05:45,417 --> 00:05:47,234
No.

126
00:05:47,286 --> 00:05:48,802
- Come on, Kate, come on.
- No.

127
00:05:48,804 --> 00:05:50,203
Come on, come on. You're good.

128
00:05:50,255 --> 00:05:51,938
And I'm not talking about karaoke-good.

129
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,740
I'm talking good-good.

130
00:05:53,776 --> 00:05:54,958
(laughs)

131
00:05:54,993 --> 00:05:56,343
Have... did... you... did... (sighs)

132
00:05:56,378 --> 00:05:57,944
Did you ever perform?

133
00:05:57,946 --> 00:05:59,963
When I was really young.

134
00:05:59,998 --> 00:06:02,199
Cyndi Lauper was kind of my jam.

135
00:06:02,234 --> 00:06:03,433
Mm-hmm.

136
00:06:03,469 --> 00:06:06,119
"Time after Time" cover was...

137
00:06:06,155 --> 00:06:08,088
I rocked it. I was, you know...

138
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,206
I rocked it like it was my job.

139
00:06:09,241 --> 00:06:11,525
- Mm-hmm.
- But then I grew up.

140
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,126
And then I grew...

141
00:06:13,178 --> 00:06:15,862
and, um, you know,

142
00:06:15,898 --> 00:06:17,781
I try to avoid the spotlight.

143
00:06:17,816 --> 00:06:19,132
Are you done? Yes.

144
00:06:19,184 --> 00:06:20,417
Are you?

145
00:06:20,452 --> 00:06:23,069
(whispering): One more song.

146
00:06:23,105 --> 00:06:24,905
One more song.

147
00:06:24,957 --> 00:06:27,207
One more song. KEVIN: Okay, Kate,

148
00:06:27,242 --> 00:06:29,976
I am super pumped about
this move to New York City.

149
00:06:30,012 --> 00:06:31,311
I mean, we've got a ton to figure out,

150
00:06:31,346 --> 00:06:33,313
of course, but I'm super pumped.

151
00:06:33,315 --> 00:06:35,549
Wait... that was real?

152
00:06:35,601 --> 00:06:38,318
Yeah. Stage acting, it's my new jam.
Oh...

153
00:06:38,353 --> 00:06:40,403
Do you think you could get
that really cute, uh,

154
00:06:40,455 --> 00:06:42,389
that theater casting director,
the one who liked me. What's...

155
00:06:42,441 --> 00:06:44,090
- Cara.
- Cara, yes.

156
00:06:44,126 --> 00:06:45,358
I love Cara... Yeah.

157
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:46,560
Oh, and when you get her on the phone,

158
00:06:46,595 --> 00:06:49,146
tell her I'm only interested
in doing heavy drama.

159
00:06:49,181 --> 00:06:50,630
We're not moving all the
way to New York City

160
00:06:50,632 --> 00:06:52,983
so I can do some lame
off-Broadway comedy.

161
00:06:53,018 --> 00:06:54,551
You want me to go with you?

162
00:06:54,586 --> 00:06:56,286
(laughs) Of course. Yeah.

163
00:06:56,321 --> 00:06:57,721
There's no way I could
do this without you.

164
00:06:57,773 --> 00:07:00,023
Oh, and maybe you should specify

165
00:07:00,058 --> 00:07:01,725
that I don't want to do anything
where I have to show my penis.

166
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,160
Wow. Wow.

167
00:07:03,212 --> 00:07:04,694
Toby.

168
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,763
- I didn't see you there, man. What's up?
- Hi.

169
00:07:06,798 --> 00:07:08,298
How's this? You know what we should do?

170
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:09,633
We should look into the
meat-packing district.

171
00:07:09,668 --> 00:07:10,951
It's like an up and coming

172
00:07:10,986 --> 00:07:12,319
(mumbles with mouth full)

173
00:07:12,371 --> 00:07:14,538
Pancakes are good.

174
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:15,906
(whispering): Is she
making you eat this?

175
00:07:15,941 --> 00:07:18,241
(quietly): I'm trying to have some sex.

176
00:07:20,345 --> 00:07:23,914
So now he's been here for about a week.

177
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:26,399
I guess I just wanted to get
used to the idea of him myself,

178
00:07:26,435 --> 00:07:30,370
you know, before I told you,
and this has nothing to do

179
00:07:30,422 --> 00:07:31,955
with you or Dad... I
hope you know that.

180
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:34,241
- I do know that, yes, of course.
- Okay, okay.

181
00:07:34,243 --> 00:07:35,775
I mean, obviously, I've
been curious about him

182
00:07:35,811 --> 00:07:38,094
since I was a kid.

183
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:40,947
And I know you guys would have
found him if you could have.

184
00:07:44,386 --> 00:07:45,952
So who is he?

185
00:07:45,954 --> 00:07:47,520
What did he tell you about himself?

186
00:07:47,522 --> 00:07:48,838
(chuckling): Uh...

187
00:07:48,891 --> 00:07:50,507
His name is William.

188
00:07:51,526 --> 00:07:53,093
That's it?

189
00:07:53,128 --> 00:07:54,527
- He didn't tell you anything else?
- (laughing)

190
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:57,297
Uh, he has a cat.

191
00:07:57,332 --> 00:07:58,732
Stomach cancer.

192
00:08:00,702 --> 00:08:02,625
It's the basic gist of
what I know so far.

193
00:08:02,651 --> 00:08:03,544
(quietly): Wow.

194
00:08:05,657 --> 00:08:07,357
(sighs)

195
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,177
(inhales) Well, where is he?

196
00:08:11,179 --> 00:08:12,796
I'd like to, uh, meet him.

197
00:08:12,831 --> 00:08:14,581
- He's in Annie's room, but...
- Okay.

198
00:08:14,616 --> 00:08:16,917
I don't know if he's
ready for company, Ma.

199
00:08:16,952 --> 00:08:18,768
Hold on one second.

200
00:08:30,249 --> 00:08:32,415
- (traffic and street sounds)
- JACK: Okay.

201
00:08:32,451 --> 00:08:34,467
Okay.

202
00:08:34,503 --> 00:08:35,552
Car seats are installed.

203
00:08:35,587 --> 00:08:37,037
Policeman approved.

204
00:08:37,072 --> 00:08:38,688
I'll pull up, we'll load up.

205
00:08:38,724 --> 00:08:40,073
And then the adventure begins, yeah?

206
00:08:40,108 --> 00:08:41,608
Okay.

207
00:08:41,643 --> 00:08:44,444
If I were you, I would
head right to Mexico.

208
00:08:44,479 --> 00:08:46,279
If I don't come back, at least
you'll know where to find me.

209
00:08:46,315 --> 00:08:47,597
(laughs) Oh...

210
00:08:50,202 --> 00:08:52,736
(sighs)

211
00:09:00,095 --> 00:09:01,761
Hey!

212
00:09:08,203 --> 00:09:09,719
Wait.

213
00:09:12,107 --> 00:09:13,556
Okay, let's lock and load.

214
00:09:13,592 --> 00:09:15,542
- Here, I got him.
- Yeah.

215
00:09:15,577 --> 00:09:16,893
(groaning): Oh. Come on, big boy.

216
00:09:16,928 --> 00:09:18,428
Okay.

217
00:09:21,016 --> 00:09:23,483
(knocks on door)

218
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,835
- Hey.
- Hey.

219
00:09:25,871 --> 00:09:27,904
- I wanted to introdu...
- Hi.

220
00:09:27,939 --> 00:09:29,823
I'm Rebecca, I'm Randall's mother.

221
00:09:29,858 --> 00:09:32,192
Very nice to meet you.

222
00:09:32,227 --> 00:09:34,995
Uh, nice to meet you, as well.

223
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:37,630
(chuckles)

224
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:42,602
Sweetheart, could you give
us just a moment to chat?

225
00:09:42,637 --> 00:09:44,888
Uh... yeah.

226
00:09:44,923 --> 00:09:46,406
Thank you.

227
00:09:53,415 --> 00:09:55,815
You look well.

228
00:10:02,075 --> 00:10:04,876

00:10:15,055 --> 00:10:16,605

He's being really fussy.

234
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,140
Shh.

235
00:10:18,167 --> 00:10:19,902
We have burping cloths.
Look in their bedroom.

236
00:10:19,926 --> 00:10:22,710
It's not... there's not... in here.

237
00:10:22,712 --> 00:10:24,237
Please, just come back in here.
I need you to help me, please.

238
00:10:24,262 --> 00:10:24,745
Okay.

239
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,363
- Are you laying down, Jack?
- (sighs)

240
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,033

They'll be in college soon.

244
00:10:35,858 --> 00:10:38,608
- Ha.
- (baby crying)

245
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41,995
(sighs) Which one?

246
00:10:41,997 --> 00:10:44,197
Probably the one that hates me.

247
00:10:44,233 --> 00:10:46,133
He doesn't hate you. Jack, I think

248
00:10:46,185 --> 00:10:47,968
we're gonna have to
start him on formula.

249
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,803
No. He's fine.

250
00:10:49,805 --> 00:10:51,338
He won't take to my breast.

251
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,540
We have to treat them the same.

252
00:10:53,575 --> 00:10:54,808
He's not the same.

253
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,626
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

254
00:10:56,678 --> 00:10:58,445
He's just... He's not.
I grew the other two

255
00:10:58,447 --> 00:11:01,548
inside of me, and he
feels like a stranger.

256
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:04,117
And I feel really terrible
for saying that out loud,

257
00:11:04,153 --> 00:11:06,336
but he just... he does.

258
00:11:06,372 --> 00:11:08,071
(sighs)

259
00:11:08,107 --> 00:11:10,257
(crying stops)

260
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,994
(sighs)

261
00:11:13,996 --> 00:11:16,129
Jack,

262
00:11:16,131 --> 00:11:17,998
when we were leaving the hospital...

263
00:11:18,033 --> 00:11:19,733
I know. You were having

264
00:11:19,768 --> 00:11:22,269
second thoughts about bringing him home.
It's fine.

265
00:11:22,304 --> 00:11:25,238
- No. No, it's not that. I...
- It's natural.

266
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:29,559
He's fine, Bec.

267
00:11:29,595 --> 00:11:31,261
He's fine.

268
00:11:33,015 --> 00:11:34,364
Look at us.

269
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,049
(sighs)

270
00:11:36,051 --> 00:11:38,602
I mean, I was a complete stranger.

271
00:11:38,637 --> 00:11:40,720
Look how quickly I took to your breast.

272
00:11:40,756 --> 00:11:42,406
- You're an idiot.
- Yeah.

273
00:11:42,441 --> 00:11:43,874
I'm your idiot.

274
00:11:43,909 --> 00:11:45,792
Okay?

275
00:11:45,828 --> 00:11:48,745
And they are our babies.

276
00:11:48,781 --> 00:11:51,715
He's our baby.

277
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,201
Okay?

278
00:11:54,236 --> 00:11:57,204
(baby crying)

279
00:11:57,206 --> 00:11:59,322
They'll be in college soon?

280
00:11:59,358 --> 00:12:02,626
Any day now.

281
00:12:02,661 --> 00:12:05,595
And then she just asked
to speak to him alone.

282
00:12:05,631 --> 00:12:08,098
- About what?
- I don't know.

283
00:12:08,133 --> 00:12:11,251
Whatever biological fathers and
adopted mothers talk about.

284
00:12:11,253 --> 00:12:11,991
What is that?

285
00:12:12,016 --> 00:12:14,204
The Knicks, Beth. How the
hell am I supposed to know?

286
00:12:14,239 --> 00:12:16,223
I...

287
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:22,162
You love me so much that you're
just gonna give me that one?

288
00:12:22,197 --> 00:12:26,817
Mm-hmm. You know me so well, my friend.

289
00:12:26,852 --> 00:12:28,835
I got to take him to that
doctor's appointment

290
00:12:28,871 --> 00:12:30,637
in two hours.

291
00:12:30,672 --> 00:12:32,806
God. What the hell do you think

292
00:12:32,841 --> 00:12:34,774
- they're talking about, anyway?
- I don't know, honey.

293
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,626
(sighs)

294
00:12:36,678 --> 00:12:37,994
He found me.

295
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,896
- He brought me here.
- But you stayed.

296
00:12:39,932 --> 00:12:41,798
- Yes, I stayed.
- Hmm.

297
00:12:41,834 --> 00:12:44,050
We had a deal.

298
00:12:44,086 --> 00:12:46,436
I won't tell him, if that's
what you're thinking.

299
00:12:46,472 --> 00:12:48,472
(sobs)

300
00:12:48,507 --> 00:12:52,375
Oh, God. All those... (sighs)

301
00:12:53,412 --> 00:12:55,779
It will break him.

302
00:12:55,814 --> 00:12:59,082
It will. Knowing that
he could've known you

303
00:12:59,117 --> 00:13:01,234
and that I kept him from that.

304
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:03,787
Rebecca, the deal we
made was the right one.

305
00:13:03,822 --> 00:13:05,388
For everyone.

306
00:13:06,479 --> 00:13:09,581
- If you hurt him...
- I won't.

307
00:13:13,165 --> 00:13:15,765
Fine, then.

308
00:13:15,801 --> 00:13:19,252
But know this:

309
00:13:19,288 --> 00:13:22,038
my son,

310
00:13:22,074 --> 00:13:24,858
who I raised,

311
00:13:24,893 --> 00:13:29,196
is gonna put everything he
has into trying to save you,

312
00:13:29,248 --> 00:13:31,448
because that's who he is.

313
00:13:31,483 --> 00:13:33,783
It's gonna come in front of his job,

314
00:13:33,819 --> 00:13:35,769
in front of his marriage,

315
00:13:35,804 --> 00:13:39,272
and in front of his time with his kids.

316
00:13:41,326 --> 00:13:44,945
So you better damn well be worth that.

317
00:13:47,749 --> 00:13:50,100
(sniffling)

318
00:13:53,238 --> 00:13:55,055
(sighs)

319
00:13:55,057 --> 00:13:57,040
Damn it.

320
00:13:58,043 --> 00:14:00,427
Damn it.

321
00:14:00,429 --> 00:14:03,096
Yes, um, it would be for
an open-ended reservation,

322
00:14:03,148 --> 00:14:05,899
until we can find him a rental.

323
00:14:05,934 --> 00:14:09,436
And your pillows are
hypoallergenic, yeah?

324
00:14:09,438 --> 00:14:12,739
And can I just confirm that the
hotel gym's not just, like,

325
00:14:12,774 --> 00:14:14,941
three crappy elliptical machines?

326
00:14:14,977 --> 00:14:17,377
'Cause he needs space for
floor work and exercise

327
00:14:17,429 --> 00:14:19,112
and free weight... Great.

328
00:14:19,164 --> 00:14:21,431
You know, actually, can I just
have pictures sent to me?

329
00:14:21,466 --> 00:14:23,450
Hey, babe.

330
00:14:23,485 --> 00:14:25,335
Have you seen my keys?

331
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:28,004
I think you left 'em in
the plan you never made.

332
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,492
(chuckles) So she's funny, too.
That's good. My keys.

333
00:14:32,544 --> 00:14:33,727
So?

334
00:14:33,762 --> 00:14:36,129
He seems very nice.

335
00:14:36,181 --> 00:14:38,281
MIKE: Honey,

336
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:39,382
we should get going if
we're gonna get dinner

337
00:14:39,418 --> 00:14:40,900
- in the city first.
- Oh.

338
00:14:40,936 --> 00:14:42,469
- I bet the tunnel's gonna be jammed.
- Okay.

339
00:14:42,504 --> 00:14:43,787
No, stay!

340
00:14:43,822 --> 00:14:45,605
- Oh...
- Dad's work friend doesn't eat a lot.

341
00:14:45,641 --> 00:14:47,424
- You can have some of his dinner.
- (chuckling): What?

342
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:50,810
Uh, Grandma and Grandpa
can't stay, girls.

343
00:14:50,846 --> 00:14:52,162
- Aw...
- And, anyway, I've got

344
00:14:52,214 --> 00:14:55,682
an appointment with my
work friend, so, um...

345
00:14:55,717 --> 00:14:56,916
I promise to catch up

346
00:14:56,952 --> 00:14:58,568
- with you about all this.
- Mm-hmm.

347
00:14:58,604 --> 00:15:00,303
- Promise? Mm-hmm.
- Miguel,

348
00:15:00,339 --> 00:15:03,490
thanks for dropping by unexpectedly.
Ha-ha-ha.

349
00:15:03,542 --> 00:15:06,543
(mimics VCR) Rewind.
Thanks for dropping by.

350
00:15:06,595 --> 00:15:09,863
Always love it. Always love you guys.
Peace.

351
00:15:12,551 --> 00:15:14,651
He's hiding something.

352
00:15:16,488 --> 00:15:19,155
Hey. We got to get goin'.

353
00:15:21,977 --> 00:15:24,644
William?

354
00:15:25,764 --> 00:15:28,415
Hey.

355
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:30,984
William. Where you goin'?

356
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:33,119
Home. Why? What happened?

357
00:15:33,155 --> 00:15:34,954
- We got the doctor's appointment.
- You should cancel.

358
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:37,791
Why would I cancel... W-Will
you get in the damn car?

359
00:15:37,826 --> 00:15:39,492
I knew if I told you I was
leaving, you'd try and stop me

360
00:15:39,528 --> 00:15:42,245
like you are right now.

361
00:15:42,297 --> 00:15:45,231
You'd try and stop me 'cause you
were raised to be a good man.

362
00:15:45,267 --> 00:15:47,917
But I wasn't the one who
raised you that way, Randall.

363
00:15:47,953 --> 00:15:49,686
I was reminded of that today.

364
00:15:49,738 --> 00:15:51,554
That you have parents.

365
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,790
That I just can't step
in 40 years later

366
00:15:53,825 --> 00:15:55,709
and enjoy the fruits of
someone else's labor.

367
00:15:55,744 --> 00:15:57,510
So, just like that, you go?

368
00:15:57,546 --> 00:15:59,279
- No good-bye to the girls?
- The girls

369
00:15:59,331 --> 00:16:00,480
- will be fine.
- No, they'll be devastated.

370
00:16:00,515 --> 00:16:01,531
They don't even know

371
00:16:01,566 --> 00:16:02,816
who I am.

372
00:16:02,851 --> 00:16:04,751
- Look, this doctor...
- He isn't gonna

373
00:16:04,786 --> 00:16:06,219
tell me anything I don't already know.

374
00:16:06,271 --> 00:16:07,537
- But he might.
- He won't.

375
00:16:07,589 --> 00:16:09,189
But he might.

376
00:16:11,993 --> 00:16:14,361
And something tells me he might
be a little more thorough

377
00:16:14,396 --> 00:16:16,296
than the doctor at whatever
free homeless clinic

378
00:16:16,348 --> 00:16:18,498
you've been going to to get
your free medical counsel at.

379
00:16:18,533 --> 00:16:20,650
To say nothing of the fact
that I had to kiss up

380
00:16:20,686 --> 00:16:22,402
to the biggest D-bag at my firm

381
00:16:22,437 --> 00:16:23,703
just to get you this appointment.

382
00:16:23,739 --> 00:16:25,021
So, yes, William,

383
00:16:25,057 --> 00:16:27,657
you are getting in the car right now,

384
00:16:27,693 --> 00:16:29,976
and we are going to this
doctor's appointment.

385
00:16:30,011 --> 00:16:32,829
And then and only then
will I give you permission

386
00:16:32,881 --> 00:16:35,048
to hobble off like Hobo
Joe without saying

387
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,667
so much as a good-bye.

388
00:16:40,655 --> 00:16:42,539
Startin' to not feel so bad

389
00:16:42,574 --> 00:16:45,358
about leaving you at that fire station.

390
00:16:45,394 --> 00:16:46,960
Yeah, whatever.

391
00:16:49,264 --> 00:16:50,997
Hi, white people.

392
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,960
Friendly neighborhood black man.

393
00:16:56,504 --> 00:16:58,305
TOBY: Uh, Kate, can I
get one right here?

394
00:16:58,357 --> 00:17:00,925
Kate? Right here? Can I
just get one right here?

395
00:17:00,965 --> 00:17:03,081
- Kate? Who are you wearing? Kate? Kate?
- What are you doing?

396
00:17:03,117 --> 00:17:06,618
Is it true that you're dating Taylor
Swift? Is it true that you just broke up

397
00:17:06,654 --> 00:17:07,853
with Taylor Swift just now?

398
00:17:07,888 --> 00:17:10,038
(laughs)

399
00:17:10,074 --> 00:17:12,274
What are you doing?

400
00:17:12,326 --> 00:17:14,259
- Give me just one day.
- (shutter clicks)

401
00:17:14,311 --> 00:17:18,280
One day where you're the star.

402
00:17:27,358 --> 00:17:30,475
(groans, sighs)

403
00:17:30,511 --> 00:17:32,761
♪ ♪

404
00:17:48,979 --> 00:17:50,746
(clatters)

405
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,751
(sputters)

406
00:17:55,786 --> 00:17:57,686
Hey, where are you? I've
called you, like, ten times.

407
00:17:57,738 --> 00:17:59,688
Listen, um... Can we just
hire one of those services

408
00:17:59,723 --> 00:18:02,541
that comes in and, you know,
packs everything for you?

409
00:18:02,576 --> 00:18:04,293
I think Jason Momoa told me
about a guy who does that.

410
00:18:04,328 --> 00:18:05,794
Let's get that number
from Momoa's office.

411
00:18:05,829 --> 00:18:07,246
His assistant. That, uh...

412
00:18:07,281 --> 00:18:09,264
Dahala Mapuana, I think her name was.

413
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,782
Or was it Patty?

414
00:18:10,818 --> 00:18:12,284
You remember Jason Momoa.
He's the, uh...

415
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:14,086
he's the original Dothraki guy.

416
00:18:14,121 --> 00:18:16,338
We met him at Seth Green's house.
Where are you, all right?

417
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,223
I'm getting overwhelmed.
Pick up the phone.

418
00:18:20,127 --> 00:18:22,444
- Where are we going?
- Well,

419
00:18:22,446 --> 00:18:23,979
no more background singing for you.

420
00:18:24,014 --> 00:18:25,464
Your voice is way too beautiful

421
00:18:25,499 --> 00:18:27,199
to only be heard in a bathroom.

422
00:18:27,234 --> 00:18:29,735
Today is your day, babe.

423
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:32,754
We are on our way to
your first big gig.

424
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:35,540
- What?
- Yep, I, uh... I downloaded

425
00:18:35,576 --> 00:18:37,976
an instrumental copy
of "Time after Time,"

426
00:18:38,012 --> 00:18:39,594
found an old boom box.

427
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:42,965
- It's showtime, baby!
- Toby,

428
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,038
there is no way in hell that I'm
gonna sing in front of people.

429
00:18:46,147 --> 00:18:49,237
Well, then you'll be
depriving the world.

430
00:18:49,273 --> 00:18:52,240
- Well, the world will live.
- Yes, but your audience

431
00:18:52,276 --> 00:18:54,476
may not. (grunts)

432
00:18:54,478 --> 00:18:56,261
All right.

433
00:18:56,297 --> 00:18:58,864
(grunts) What the hell?

434
00:19:00,117 --> 00:19:02,451
Okay, so,

435
00:19:02,486 --> 00:19:04,753
my Aunt Dolly actually lives here.

436
00:19:04,788 --> 00:19:06,855
All right, I booked you in
their prime slot, 3:00 p.m.

437
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:09,491
It's right after Jell-O
but before their nap.

438
00:19:09,526 --> 00:19:11,543
Perfect place to break
your seal, right?

439
00:19:11,578 --> 00:19:13,845
Now, remember, most of 'em
will probably be asleep.

440
00:19:13,881 --> 00:19:15,864
The rest won't remember this tomorrow.
And most of them

441
00:19:15,899 --> 00:19:18,667
lived through World War II,
so no matter how bad you are,

442
00:19:18,669 --> 00:19:20,369
they've seen worse. (chuckles)

443
00:19:20,404 --> 00:19:21,970
Come on.

444
00:19:21,972 --> 00:19:23,205
I'm sorry, do you need the red carpet?

445
00:19:23,207 --> 00:19:25,440
- No.
- Okay, come on.

446
00:19:25,476 --> 00:19:28,243
- (babies crying)
- DR. K: Well, now,

447
00:19:28,245 --> 00:19:32,614
all three of these babies are
looking very good, Jack.

448
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:35,267
Very strong, very healthy.

449
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:37,469
Okay, good. That's good.

450
00:19:37,504 --> 00:19:39,054
'Cause some-sometimes one does

451
00:19:39,056 --> 00:19:40,505
something different than the other two.

452
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:42,657
You just... you start spinnin'

453
00:19:42,693 --> 00:19:45,494
- a little...
- They're all doing very well.

454
00:19:45,546 --> 00:19:47,362
Okay.

455
00:19:47,398 --> 00:19:49,031
How are you guys doing?

456
00:19:49,066 --> 00:19:51,133
Oh, we're great.

457
00:19:51,168 --> 00:19:52,968
We're good. We're, um...

458
00:19:53,003 --> 00:19:55,120
tired

459
00:19:55,155 --> 00:19:58,273
- but, uh, good.
- Uh-huh. And Rebecca?

460
00:19:58,308 --> 00:20:01,510
I mean, I only ask because
it's a little unusual

461
00:20:01,512 --> 00:20:03,979
for the father to be here alone.

462
00:20:04,014 --> 00:20:07,132
She just needed a little break,

463
00:20:07,184 --> 00:20:08,333
you know?

464
00:20:08,369 --> 00:20:10,452
She's... she's...

465
00:20:10,487 --> 00:20:13,321
she's not totally herself.

466
00:20:13,323 --> 00:20:16,708
I mean, she's a...

467
00:20:16,744 --> 00:20:18,076
little dazed,

468
00:20:18,112 --> 00:20:21,329
I guess? She's not
bonding with the babies.

469
00:20:21,382 --> 00:20:23,115
And not with Kyle, mainly.

470
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:25,667
You know? Not with Kyle.

471
00:20:25,702 --> 00:20:29,304
I think she might be a little broken.

472
00:20:29,338 --> 00:20:33,274
You know, I-I think the babies
might have broken my wife.

473
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:35,410
You can fix her, right?

474
00:20:35,446 --> 00:20:37,312
Or you can tell me how to fix her?

475
00:20:37,347 --> 00:20:38,914
I was... I was hoping you could tell me

476
00:20:38,949 --> 00:20:40,348
- how to fix her.
- Sit down, Jack.

477
00:20:55,632 --> 00:20:58,366
She lost a baby, Jack.

478
00:20:58,402 --> 00:21:00,869
You can't just dismiss that.

479
00:21:00,871 --> 00:21:03,672
- So did I.
- Yeah.

480
00:21:03,674 --> 00:21:08,226
And you took your grief, and you...
channeled it into action.

481
00:21:08,278 --> 00:21:11,446
You willed yourself
forward with positivity,

482
00:21:11,448 --> 00:21:14,332
but Rebecca has just...

483
00:21:14,384 --> 00:21:16,468
She's gonna have to do
this in her own way,

484
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,171
and you're just gonna have to
give her the space to do it.

485
00:21:19,206 --> 00:21:21,923
Yeah. What if she doesn't find her way?

486
00:21:21,925 --> 00:21:23,458
She will. How do you know?

487
00:21:23,494 --> 00:21:25,193
For the same reason that I know

488
00:21:25,229 --> 00:21:27,446
you're gonna give her
the space to find it.

489
00:21:27,481 --> 00:21:30,599
'Cause I believe in good people.

490
00:21:31,835 --> 00:21:33,969
Of course, I voted for Nixon,

491
00:21:34,021 --> 00:21:37,105
so you got to take everything
I say with a grain of salt.

492
00:21:37,157 --> 00:21:38,673
(laughs)

493
00:21:38,675 --> 00:21:41,076
Now, look, there's a couch
in there in my office.

494
00:21:41,128 --> 00:21:43,278
Why don't you go lie down, take a nap?

495
00:21:43,313 --> 00:21:45,280
I'm-I'm totally free
the rest of the day.

496
00:21:45,282 --> 00:21:47,315
I can use the time with my namesakes.

497
00:21:47,351 --> 00:21:49,851
(laughs) No, there's three.
You don't... you don't...

498
00:21:49,887 --> 00:21:51,636
I brought them into the world, Jack.

499
00:21:51,688 --> 00:21:54,589
I am perfectly qualified to
sit here and watch 'em sleep

500
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:56,591
and crap themselves for
a couple of hours.

501
00:21:56,643 --> 00:21:58,493
Now go. Now.

502
00:22:13,443 --> 00:22:17,646
(bus brakes squeak, doors whoosh open)

503
00:22:17,648 --> 00:22:19,514
Hi. Sorry to bother you.

504
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:21,333
I'm looking for someone. Um,

505
00:22:21,368 --> 00:22:24,920
he's Afro-American, very, very thin.

506
00:22:24,955 --> 00:22:26,938
Possibly on drugs.

507
00:22:26,974 --> 00:22:28,540
(scoffs)

508
00:22:28,592 --> 00:22:30,275
You know what? I sound ridiculous.

509
00:22:30,327 --> 00:22:31,760
Sorry. I sound so stupid.

510
00:22:31,812 --> 00:22:35,564
You mean Shakespeare?
You looking for him?

511
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:37,332
Come on, get in.

512
00:22:46,067 --> 00:22:48,569
- (feedback squeals)
- TOBY: All right. Uh, good afternoon,

513
00:22:48,604 --> 00:22:51,755
ladies and germs. Uh, my name is Toby.

514
00:22:52,089 --> 00:22:53,972
I'm actually, uh,

515
00:22:53,974 --> 00:22:55,340
Dolly's nephew.

516
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:56,875
Everybody knows Aunt Dolly, right?

517
00:22:56,910 --> 00:23:00,128
Wave for everybody, Dolly.
Hello, Dolly!

518
00:23:00,163 --> 00:23:02,097
Be careful, gentlemen.
She's a real man-eater.

519
00:23:02,132 --> 00:23:03,715
Aren't you, Dolly?

520
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:06,367
(laughs) Okay. Okay,
well, we have a very

521
00:23:06,403 --> 00:23:08,186
special treat for you this afternoon.

522
00:23:08,188 --> 00:23:10,672
The lady that I am about to introduce

523
00:23:10,724 --> 00:23:13,141
has been called the next Bette Midler.

524
00:23:13,193 --> 00:23:17,112
Adele admires her, Streisand
considers her a friend,

525
00:23:17,147 --> 00:23:20,465
J.Lo wishes she had that ass.

526
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,235
Ladies and gentlemen,
performing for one song only,

527
00:23:24,271 --> 00:23:26,654
I give you... Kate! Oh!

528
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:28,957
(applause)

529
00:23:28,992 --> 00:23:30,325
Oh, yeah.

530
00:23:30,377 --> 00:23:31,810
All right, here we go.

531
00:23:31,812 --> 00:23:33,261
That's for you.

532
00:23:33,296 --> 00:23:34,646
- Really? You want me to...?
- Yup.

533
00:23:34,681 --> 00:23:37,182
(sighs) Okay.

534
00:23:37,184 --> 00:23:40,485

intro to "Time after Time")

535
00:23:40,487 --> 00:23:42,937

Yeah!

567
00:25:50,459 --> 00:25:52,893
Yeah! Come on!

568
00:25:52,895 --> 00:25:54,795

00:25:58,484 --> 00:26:01,168
(moaning)

570
00:26:01,203 --> 00:26:03,603
Oh. Oh, if I had known.

571
00:26:03,639 --> 00:26:06,223
(moaning): I would have... I would have

572
00:26:06,258 --> 00:26:07,824
taken you to the nursing
home for every date.

573
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,209
Shut up. Okay.

574
00:26:09,244 --> 00:26:11,211
- (moans, phone plays tune)
- Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

575
00:26:11,246 --> 00:26:13,046
Uh-uh. No. No, no, just shut it off.

576
00:26:13,048 --> 00:26:14,781
- Crap.
- Just shut it off!

577
00:26:14,783 --> 00:26:15,916
What?

578
00:26:15,951 --> 00:26:17,317
ELAINE: Oh, my sister was

579
00:26:17,353 --> 00:26:18,719
so right about... Elaine's here.

580
00:26:18,754 --> 00:26:20,203
She's trashing the joint, I'm locked

581
00:26:20,239 --> 00:26:22,556
- in the closet.
- Insane Elaine? Why is she there?

582
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:24,057
- (indistinct yelling, clattering)
- I called her.

583
00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:25,442
How?

584
00:26:25,494 --> 00:26:27,260
I deleted her number
from your contacts.

585
00:26:27,262 --> 00:26:29,730
I found it in the Cloud.

586
00:26:29,765 --> 00:26:31,882
- You called Insane Elaine?
- (glass breaking through phone)

587
00:26:31,934 --> 00:26:33,433
And I had sex with her.

588
00:26:33,469 --> 00:26:35,669
And I told her I was
moving to New York,

589
00:26:35,704 --> 00:26:36,608
and then she went crazy.

590
00:26:36,633 --> 00:26:38,905
I am not crazy! Why does
everyone call me crazy?! Why?!

591
00:26:38,907 --> 00:26:39,361
(clattering)

592
00:26:39,386 --> 00:26:40,748
You know what? Um, I got
a little overwhelmed

593
00:26:40,776 --> 00:26:43,160
with the move, you know, I tried
calling you, but you're not

594
00:26:43,195 --> 00:26:45,395
- picking up. Oh, God.
- (glass breaking)

595
00:26:45,431 --> 00:26:47,798
You know what? She's breaking
things again. Get over here.

596
00:26:47,833 --> 00:26:50,183
I will be right over.

597
00:26:50,219 --> 00:26:52,052
(phone beeps off)

598
00:26:52,087 --> 00:26:53,570
I am...

599
00:26:53,605 --> 00:26:54,893
I'm sorry. I have to go.

600
00:26:54,956 --> 00:26:56,672
Oh, but really, you don't,

601
00:26:56,708 --> 00:26:58,391
and it's kind of crazy that
you think that you do.

602
00:26:59,105 --> 00:27:00,705
Toby, you don't get it.

603
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:01,677
We're-we're twins. We're
not like regular people.

604
00:27:01,702 --> 00:27:04,209
When I was a kid, broke my arm

605
00:27:04,234 --> 00:27:06,545
and he cried out in pain
ten miles away, right?

606
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:07,467
We're that connected.

607
00:27:07,491 --> 00:27:09,607
I thought we were, too, is the thing.

608
00:27:09,643 --> 00:27:13,361
Kate, I'm not some nut job
who performs grand gestures

609
00:27:13,363 --> 00:27:17,282
for every girl that I
go on a few dates with.

610
00:27:17,574 --> 00:27:21,709
I like you, Kate. I like you a lot.

611
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:25,057
But I can't... I can't play
second banana to your brother.

612
00:27:25,592 --> 00:27:28,309
You have to.

613
00:27:28,311 --> 00:27:30,945
Everyone has to.

614
00:27:32,199 --> 00:27:34,015
(door opens)

615
00:27:34,017 --> 00:27:35,383
(door closes)

616
00:27:35,832 --> 00:27:37,249
Great.

617
00:27:37,809 --> 00:27:40,159
Have a good time in New York!

618
00:27:41,275 --> 00:27:43,293
DOCTOR: William, will
you join me out here?

619
00:27:44,947 --> 00:27:46,735
William.

620
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:50,134
Randall. I wish I had better news.

621
00:27:50,192 --> 00:27:52,993
The cancer has metastasized

622
00:27:53,028 --> 00:27:55,863
to a point where there's
really not much we can do.

623
00:27:56,681 --> 00:27:59,115
There are some experimental treatments.
Frankly,

624
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:01,067
they haven't been very promising.

625
00:28:01,102 --> 00:28:04,587
I'm very, very sorry.

626
00:28:04,639 --> 00:28:07,056
(knocking)

627
00:28:10,528 --> 00:28:12,094
Um...

628
00:28:16,751 --> 00:28:20,236
WILLIAM: I'm not very well,
as you can probably tell.

629
00:28:22,572 --> 00:28:24,922
The baby didn't come from this.

630
00:28:24,957 --> 00:28:26,740
It came from love.

631
00:28:26,776 --> 00:28:28,659
His mother?

632
00:28:28,661 --> 00:28:34,014
You know, we-we... we met
on that bus, actually.

633
00:28:34,066 --> 00:28:38,335
My world spun on every axis that day.

634
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:43,868
I read poetry to her the
first time we talked.

635
00:28:43,903 --> 00:28:45,887
Uh, not any of mine.

636
00:28:45,939 --> 00:28:47,605
I was too shy for that.

637
00:28:47,607 --> 00:28:50,007
One of my

638
00:28:50,009 --> 00:28:52,443
favorite poets, and...

639
00:28:55,215 --> 00:28:57,899
She used to love it when I read to her.

640
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:03,771
So what'd you name the baby?

641
00:29:03,823 --> 00:29:06,124
Kyle.

642
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:09,010
I was having triplets, and, um,

643
00:29:09,045 --> 00:29:11,929
on a whim, actually, we
just decided to name them.

644
00:29:11,965 --> 00:29:14,732
Kevin, Kate and Kyle.

645
00:29:18,488 --> 00:29:23,274
I... I lost one of the
babies during delivery,

646
00:29:23,309 --> 00:29:25,576
but your baby showed up

647
00:29:25,612 --> 00:29:27,545
at the hospital the very same morning.

648
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,897
It felt like destiny.

649
00:29:37,357 --> 00:29:40,608
Um... I just...

650
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,727
I appreciate this. I-I, um...

651
00:29:42,762 --> 00:29:45,146
I wanted to know his story.

652
00:29:46,766 --> 00:29:49,350
And that there was good here, so...

653
00:29:49,402 --> 00:29:53,221
I wonder if I could check on him

654
00:29:53,273 --> 00:29:55,439
from time to time.

655
00:29:55,492 --> 00:29:58,576
No. No.

656
00:30:00,814 --> 00:30:03,447
I-I also need to know...

657
00:30:03,449 --> 00:30:06,284
I need to know that you're
not gonna come back for him.

658
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:10,204
I need to know that I can move forward.

659
00:30:10,256 --> 00:30:13,875
Because he will have your blood

660
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:16,794
and the blanket you wrapped
him up in, but that's it.

661
00:30:16,796 --> 00:30:18,196
That's the deal. Otherwise, I...

662
00:30:18,198 --> 00:30:19,964
I understand.

663
00:30:19,999 --> 00:30:22,316
Okay.

664
00:30:32,846 --> 00:30:34,595
I'm not...

665
00:30:34,647 --> 00:30:36,414
(sighs)

666
00:30:36,416 --> 00:30:38,149
I'm not bonding with the baby.

667
00:30:38,184 --> 00:30:42,186
(crying): I want to love
him like he's my own,

668
00:30:42,222 --> 00:30:46,357
but every time I look at his face...

669
00:30:46,392 --> 00:30:47,875
(sighs heavily)

670
00:30:47,911 --> 00:30:50,311
(cries)

671
00:30:51,497 --> 00:30:54,465
Give him his own name.

672
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:04,876
What was the name of the, uh,
poet you used to read to her?

673
00:31:04,911 --> 00:31:06,911
Your favorite poet.

674
00:31:18,825 --> 00:31:21,792
Maybe you'll see fit to
give it to him someday.

675
00:31:29,619 --> 00:31:32,536
Thank you.

676
00:31:36,092 --> 00:31:37,808
(door closes)

677
00:31:48,705 --> 00:31:51,305
BETH: Hey.

678
00:31:51,341 --> 00:31:52,873
Hey.

679
00:31:52,909 --> 00:31:54,375
How'd it go?

680
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:55,843
It's bad.

681
00:31:55,878 --> 00:31:59,497
Nothing to be done, really.

682
00:31:59,499 --> 00:32:01,215
Some experimental treatments

683
00:32:01,251 --> 00:32:03,985
that'll give him a few more months.

684
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,554
He's upstairs resting.

685
00:32:06,589 --> 00:32:10,207
Peacefully with his arms crossed
over his chest, no doubt.

686
00:32:10,209 --> 00:32:11,859
I have no idea how I
came from that man.

687
00:32:11,911 --> 00:32:13,728
I'm so sorry, babe.

688
00:32:13,763 --> 00:32:15,630
Yeah, I don't know what I expected.

689
00:32:15,665 --> 00:32:17,465
Yes, I do.

690
00:32:17,517 --> 00:32:20,055
I expected to find a father
who wasn't so damn sick.

691
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:20,901
Randall...

692
00:32:20,937 --> 00:32:23,621
I should have looked for
him years ago, Beth.

693
00:32:23,656 --> 00:32:26,340
I mean, the girls could have had
a grandfather all this time.

694
00:32:26,376 --> 00:32:28,676
Instead, I brought him
here so they could what?

695
00:32:28,728 --> 00:32:30,895
Fall in love with a dying man.

696
00:32:30,947 --> 00:32:33,864
So, this is about the girls, then?

697
00:32:33,866 --> 00:32:35,599
Hmm?

698
00:32:35,601 --> 00:32:38,919
You don't want them to
fall in love with him?

699
00:32:41,824 --> 00:32:44,008
He's been here a week, baby.

700
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,893
And you don't know any more about him

701
00:32:45,928 --> 00:32:48,646
then you did the first time
he walked through that door.

702
00:32:50,366 --> 00:32:53,234
I don't know what you were
looking for with all this,

703
00:32:53,286 --> 00:32:57,688
or even if you do, but I do know

704
00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:00,624
you don't have a whole lot of time.

705
00:33:33,593 --> 00:33:36,427
Is she gone? Yeah.

706
00:33:36,479 --> 00:33:37,812
Oh.

707
00:33:37,847 --> 00:33:39,914
God, I hope the booty
call was worth it.

708
00:33:39,949 --> 00:33:41,215
It was.

709
00:33:42,785 --> 00:33:45,369
I just started to get
overwhelmed, you know?

710
00:33:45,405 --> 00:33:47,671
Started reading one of
those plays you gave me.

711
00:33:47,707 --> 00:33:49,457
You actually read one?

712
00:33:49,509 --> 00:33:51,175
I read them all, actually.

713
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:53,511
But, uh, this one, though,
it's really good, you know?

714
00:33:53,546 --> 00:33:55,096
Like, really good.

715
00:33:55,131 --> 00:33:57,615
And I just started to get
a little overwhelmed

716
00:33:57,617 --> 00:33:59,433
'cause I felt like, um,

717
00:33:59,469 --> 00:34:01,736
I felt like maybe it
was too good for me.

718
00:34:01,788 --> 00:34:03,020
It's not, Kevin.

719
00:34:03,056 --> 00:34:04,922
It's not... they would be lucky.

720
00:34:06,592 --> 00:34:08,325
Well...

721
00:34:12,198 --> 00:34:16,083
So my guy turned out to be
more insane than Elaine.

722
00:34:16,135 --> 00:34:18,202
Toby? Get this.

723
00:34:18,237 --> 00:34:20,771
So he takes me to a nursing home...

724
00:34:20,823 --> 00:34:22,556
to sing in front of old people.

725
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:24,091
Mm-hmm.

726
00:34:24,127 --> 00:34:26,377
So I'd be a star but in a
comfortable environment,

727
00:34:26,379 --> 00:34:28,279
'cause otherwise I would freak out.

728
00:34:28,281 --> 00:34:29,780
It was the whole works.

729
00:34:29,782 --> 00:34:31,837
He had the red carpet,
he had the car, suit.

730
00:34:31,862 --> 00:34:34,668
- It was like...
- Oh, that's good.

731
00:34:34,704 --> 00:34:37,004
Yeah. And then afterwards,

732
00:34:37,056 --> 00:34:39,240
like, I was on a high, like,

733
00:34:39,292 --> 00:34:43,244
I know it sounds stupid,
but I, I felt so free.

734
00:34:43,279 --> 00:34:44,845
Then what happened?

735
00:34:44,897 --> 00:34:46,897
Well, you called.

736
00:34:46,899 --> 00:34:49,300
Told him I had to go and
he got pouty and mean.

737
00:34:49,302 --> 00:34:50,801
Wait a minute, I called
at that very moment

738
00:34:50,803 --> 00:34:51,936
and you actually answered the phone?

739
00:34:51,971 --> 00:34:54,004
Of course I answered.

740
00:34:56,626 --> 00:34:59,326
Anyway, I need to focus
on losing weight

741
00:34:59,362 --> 00:35:00,928
and our big move to New York,

742
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:03,514
and I don't even need to
be in a relationship.

743
00:35:06,185 --> 00:35:07,718
You're fired.

744
00:35:08,871 --> 00:35:10,421
What?

745
00:35:10,456 --> 00:35:13,190
Yeah, Kate, you're fired.

746
00:35:13,242 --> 00:35:14,842
Why?

747
00:35:16,779 --> 00:35:20,581
You're the personal assistant
to your brother, all right?

748
00:35:20,616 --> 00:35:24,001
A brother who locks himself
in his master bedroom closet.

749
00:35:24,003 --> 00:35:25,886
A master bedroom closet

750
00:35:25,938 --> 00:35:27,571
that happens to have a mini-bar in it.

751
00:35:27,607 --> 00:35:31,575
Maybe it's time we go at it
alone for a while, you know?

752
00:35:31,577 --> 00:35:34,011
Just for a little while
to see what happens.

753
00:35:34,046 --> 00:35:36,897
You know, maybe we
need to grow up a bit.

754
00:35:44,824 --> 00:35:49,260
I don't really know who I
am if I'm not your sister.

755
00:35:52,348 --> 00:35:54,698
I do.

756
00:35:56,302 --> 00:35:58,219
You're gonna love her.

757
00:35:58,254 --> 00:36:01,555
(laughs)

758
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,383
I don't like it when you're sweet.

759
00:36:17,684 --> 00:36:19,385
Okay, I'm here. What?

760
00:36:20,922 --> 00:36:22,238
I'm sorry.

761
00:36:22,379 --> 00:36:24,395
Yeah, well, sorry doesn't
change the fact...

762
00:36:24,431 --> 00:36:26,331
What you did for me today
was the nicest thing

763
00:36:26,366 --> 00:36:28,867
- that anyone has ever done for me.
- Okay, but that still doesn't...

764
00:36:28,902 --> 00:36:31,069
And I'm not moving to New York.

765
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:32,670
- Okay, but that still doesn't change...
- I got you something.

766
00:36:32,722 --> 00:36:34,873
I accept your apology.

767
00:36:34,908 --> 00:36:37,459
Yeah? Yes.

768
00:36:37,511 --> 00:36:38,726
(phone rings)

769
00:36:38,762 --> 00:36:39,994
Don't you dare answer that.

770
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:41,229
I'm not.

771
00:36:41,264 --> 00:36:42,897
- Do not.
- I won't.

772
00:36:42,933 --> 00:36:44,074
KATE: Leave a message for Kate.

773
00:36:44,176 --> 00:36:45,552
KEVIN: Oh, Kate, good.
You didn't answer.

774
00:36:45,587 --> 00:36:48,155
Hopefully, that means
you're having sex.

775
00:36:48,207 --> 00:36:49,856
Anyway, I did it.

776
00:36:49,892 --> 00:36:51,591
I-I booked a red-eye to New York.

777
00:36:51,627 --> 00:36:53,777
I'm just gonna do it,
'cause, you know...

778
00:36:53,829 --> 00:36:54,961
Kate, if we keep talking about it,

779
00:36:54,997 --> 00:36:56,062
we'll talk ourselves out of it.

780
00:36:56,098 --> 00:36:57,280
I'll never go.

781
00:36:57,316 --> 00:36:58,899
You'll never stay, so...

782
00:36:58,934 --> 00:37:03,537
And I'm not gonna say good-bye
or anything sappy like that.

783
00:37:06,024 --> 00:37:07,724
You know how I feel.

784
00:37:09,077 --> 00:37:11,495
Okay.

785
00:37:20,472 --> 00:37:24,074
(babies cooing)

786
00:37:24,109 --> 00:37:27,527
You know, I didn't know where
you were the last four hours.

787
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:30,597
I know.

788
00:37:30,649 --> 00:37:33,166
I'm sorry.

789
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:37,687
I thought you ran off to
Mexico and abandoned the kids.

790
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:45,662
I would never run off to Mexico
and abandon the kids without you.

791
00:37:45,714 --> 00:37:48,715
Promise?

792
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:51,918
I promise.

793
00:37:56,491 --> 00:38:01,127
I can't stop thinking about
the one we lost, Jack.

794
00:38:01,129 --> 00:38:03,830
I can't. I know...

795
00:38:05,434 --> 00:38:08,134
I know we have these new
babies, and I should be happy,

796
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:11,788
but I just can't stop
thinking about him.

797
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:20,497
Me, too.

798
00:38:20,549 --> 00:38:22,782
Yeah? Yeah.

799
00:38:22,818 --> 00:38:25,518
That's all I think about.

800
00:38:25,554 --> 00:38:27,120
I feel... (sighs)

801
00:38:27,155 --> 00:38:29,556
I feel guilty when I think about him,

802
00:38:29,591 --> 00:38:32,375
and then, you know, I-I feel guilty

803
00:38:32,411 --> 00:38:34,694
when I stop thinking about him.

804
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:37,697
Me, too.

805
00:38:39,201 --> 00:38:41,051
I thought it was just me.

806
00:38:41,086 --> 00:38:43,403
No. It's me, too.

807
00:38:48,543 --> 00:38:51,444
