00:07:23,214 --> 00:07:24,682
I know they're too young
to talk about cocaine.

180
00:07:24,716 --> 00:07:26,150
I just...

181
00:07:26,184 --> 00:07:27,918
I feel like six is a hair
young for cocaine...

182
00:07:27,952 --> 00:07:29,853
Yeah, but seven... We let
them try it at seven.

183
00:07:29,888 --> 00:07:31,789
(chuckles) BETH: Um, so...

184
00:07:31,823 --> 00:07:33,357
what are you up to today, William?

185
00:07:33,391 --> 00:07:36,360
Oh, nothing much. The usual.

186
00:07:36,394 --> 00:07:40,164
I've really enjoyed being here.

187
00:07:40,198 --> 00:07:43,033
Being around those girls...
it fills me in a way...

188
00:07:43,068 --> 00:07:45,736
In a way I surely don't deserve, so...

189
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:48,338
I hope you'll let me know when
I've overstayed my welcome.

190
00:07:48,373 --> 00:07:49,740
You know, don't be silly.

191
00:07:49,774 --> 00:07:52,142
We're happy to have you.

192
00:07:52,177 --> 00:07:54,545
Uh...

193
00:07:54,579 --> 00:07:56,714
I was wondering if I could be so forward

194
00:07:56,748 --> 00:07:59,550
as to ask you for a few
dollars for the bus.

195
00:07:59,584 --> 00:08:01,952
Oh, sure. Sure.

196
00:08:04,956 --> 00:08:07,324
Where you going?

197
00:08:07,358 --> 00:08:09,760
Oh, you know, just around.

198
00:08:12,397 --> 00:08:14,164

Victor. My man.

204
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,250
How you been?

205
00:08:33,284 --> 00:08:35,419
- I've been Hector.
- Right on. Yeah.

206
00:08:35,453 --> 00:08:37,187
Yeah, and I'm sorry. I
got a lot on my mind.

207
00:08:37,222 --> 00:08:39,356
I don't know if you heard the news.
I left the show.

208
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,225
Yeah. I'm gonna meet
with the team today.

209
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:43,427
You know, we're gonna
strategize, talk next steps.

210
00:08:43,461 --> 00:08:45,262
Lots to figure out, lots to talk about.

211
00:08:45,296 --> 00:08:47,865
It's exciting. Exciting times
for everyone involved.

212
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:50,000
(phone ringing in the distance)

213
00:08:51,936 --> 00:08:54,271
LANIE: Kevin,

214
00:08:54,305 --> 00:08:56,373
do you remember where you
were when I found you?

215
00:08:56,407 --> 00:08:58,909
Yeah, sure. I was, uh, in
an improv comedy troupe.

216
00:08:58,943 --> 00:09:00,277
That's right.

217
00:09:00,311 --> 00:09:02,513
And when I saw your first show,

218
00:09:02,547 --> 00:09:04,815
do you know what I thought
to myself, Kevin?

219
00:09:04,849 --> 00:09:07,351
- No, I-I...
- I thought

220
00:09:07,385 --> 00:09:10,254
to myself... I've done it.

221
00:09:10,288 --> 00:09:12,022
I have found

222
00:09:12,056 --> 00:09:15,793
the least funny person
on the entire planet.

223
00:09:15,827 --> 00:09:17,227
Okay.

224
00:09:17,262 --> 00:09:19,463
But I saw something there,

225
00:09:19,497 --> 00:09:21,431
so I took you on.

226
00:09:21,466 --> 00:09:23,433
And I got you the commercials,

227
00:09:23,468 --> 00:09:24,735
got you the soaps,

228
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:26,904
eventually got you a job paying you

229
00:09:26,938 --> 00:09:29,373
almost three million dollars a year,

230
00:09:29,407 --> 00:09:33,310
making you so famous that
you could wear a ski cap

231
00:09:33,344 --> 00:09:35,445
when it is 80 degrees outside,

232
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,781
and no one would say a damn thing.

233
00:09:37,816 --> 00:09:39,216
Okay, Lanie...

234
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,751
Take off that hat.

235
00:09:41,986 --> 00:09:44,788
Okay.

236
00:09:44,823 --> 00:09:47,090
What's done is done, right?

237
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,593
I mean, you know, can't we just...

238
00:09:49,627 --> 00:09:51,762
move on?

239
00:09:51,796 --> 00:09:54,164
Brian... speak.

240
00:09:56,134 --> 00:09:58,869
You're contractually bound to
the show for another two years.

241
00:09:58,903 --> 00:10:00,671
Okay.

242
00:10:00,705 --> 00:10:03,006
All right, and if I refuse?

243
00:10:07,078 --> 00:10:09,179
Listen to me very carefully, Kevin.

244
00:10:09,214 --> 00:10:11,181
The network owns you.

245
00:10:11,216 --> 00:10:13,116
They can sue you for damages.

246
00:10:13,151 --> 00:10:14,618
They could bankrupt you.

247
00:10:14,652 --> 00:10:16,687
And even if someone slipped a chill pill

248
00:10:16,721 --> 00:10:18,222
into their collective drink,

249
00:10:18,256 --> 00:10:20,457
you would still be
legally unable to work

250
00:10:20,491 --> 00:10:23,160
for the next two years.

251
00:10:23,194 --> 00:10:26,196
That's for any studio, any network.

252
00:10:26,231 --> 00:10:28,165
Television or film.

253
00:10:28,199 --> 00:10:30,567
So...

254
00:10:30,602 --> 00:10:33,503
that's the good news.

255
00:10:33,538 --> 00:10:35,939
Now here's the part
you're not gonna like.

256
00:10:37,609 --> 00:10:40,010
KEVIN: <i>She's throwing this big...</i>

257
00:10:40,044 --> 00:10:41,545
Hollywood party at her
house tonight, right?

258
00:10:41,579 --> 00:10:43,413
The network president's
gonna be there, everyone.

259
00:10:43,448 --> 00:10:45,782
I'm supposed to show up, get
down on my hands and knees

260
00:10:45,817 --> 00:10:47,217
and beg to be the Manny again.

261
00:10:47,252 --> 00:10:49,186
Yeah.

262
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,755
They own me, Sis.

263
00:10:51,789 --> 00:10:53,090
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

264
00:10:53,124 --> 00:10:56,126
Well, I do, and you did it already.

265
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,295
Do you need me to show you
the video on YouTube?

266
00:10:58,329 --> 00:11:00,130
No.

267
00:11:00,164 --> 00:11:04,501
Kevin, I've known you your whole life.

268
00:11:04,535 --> 00:11:08,372
Well, except for those two
minutes at the beginning.

269
00:11:08,406 --> 00:11:11,441
You've succeed at everything
you've ever tried.

270
00:11:11,476 --> 00:11:13,577
So here's what's gonna happen.

271
00:11:13,611 --> 00:11:16,280
Okay? You're gonna go to that party,

272
00:11:16,314 --> 00:11:18,215
and you're gonna march
up to that network guy,

273
00:11:18,249 --> 00:11:20,717
and you're gonna tell him, "Manny out!"

274
00:11:20,752 --> 00:11:22,386
- Mm-hmm.
- Manny out?

275
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,021
Manny out. Manny out!

276
00:11:24,055 --> 00:11:26,556
Well, you're not supposed
to say the... Okay.

277
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:29,059
Manny out! That's good.

278
00:11:30,762 --> 00:11:32,262
(both laughing)

279
00:11:32,297 --> 00:11:34,231
- Let me ask you a question.
- Mm.

280
00:11:34,265 --> 00:11:37,601
What did I ever do those first
two minutes without you?

281
00:11:37,635 --> 00:11:40,504
Oh, you cried, and you crapped a lot.

282
00:11:40,538 --> 00:11:44,341
- (muffled laugh)
- Sounds about right. Yeah.

283
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,476
So you're coming to the party,
though, tonight with me, right?

284
00:11:46,511 --> 00:11:48,412
- The fancy Hollywood party?
- Yeah. Yeah.

285
00:11:48,446 --> 00:11:49,813
- No, I'm not.
- Yeah.

286
00:11:49,847 --> 00:11:51,515
Kevin, I... Okay, f...

287
00:11:51,549 --> 00:11:53,483
- I don't even have anything to wear.
- Kate.

288
00:11:53,518 --> 00:11:58,255
I need you there, okay?

289
00:11:58,289 --> 00:12:00,257
It's gonna be fun.

290
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:01,858
- Is it? Is-is...?
- It's gonna be a blast.

291
00:12:01,893 --> 00:12:03,393
Yes, it's gonna be a blast. Manny out.

292
00:12:03,428 --> 00:12:05,095
- Kevin, here... here's the...
- Manny out.

293
00:12:05,129 --> 00:12:06,496
Or maybe Manny <i>out!</i>

294
00:12:06,531 --> 00:12:08,231
Whatever... whatever works.

328
00:13:31,691 --> 00:13:34,560
Well, I had a crap day at work,
so I stopped at Wendy's.

329
00:13:34,594 --> 00:13:36,896
And I was about to eat in the car,

330
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,864
which is... all you know is my thing.

331
00:13:38,899 --> 00:13:42,535
The second I left the
drive-through, I threw

332
00:13:42,569 --> 00:13:46,072
ten dollars' worth of Wendy's
out of my moving car,

333
00:13:46,106 --> 00:13:48,207
and I went home, and I had a salad.

334
00:13:48,241 --> 00:13:50,009

know I'm a joke to you guys.

I know I have body distortion
issues or whatever it's called,

but it's real.

338
00:14:01,488 --> 00:14:02,855
It's brutal.

339
00:14:02,889 --> 00:14:06,559
I wish I could show you guys what I
see when I look in the mirror...

340
00:14:06,593 --> 00:14:08,227
Oh, for God's sake.

341
00:14:08,261 --> 00:14:11,363
Madison, you weigh 105 pounds.

342
00:14:11,398 --> 00:14:13,165
If you feel like a fat girl
when you look in the mirror,

343
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,134
why don't you step a damn scale?

344
00:14:15,168 --> 00:14:17,870
And when the scale reads
"One, zero, five,"

345
00:14:17,904 --> 00:14:19,171
you know that you're not fat.

346
00:14:19,206 --> 00:14:20,239
And Laurie,

347
00:14:20,273 --> 00:14:22,775
that Wendy's story, okay.

348
00:14:22,809 --> 00:14:24,243
I'm sorry, but you're just a litterer.

349
00:14:24,277 --> 00:14:26,579
You're just a littering damn litterer.

350
00:14:28,949 --> 00:14:31,283
Uh...

351
00:14:31,318 --> 00:14:34,019
well, that feels like a
good place for a break.

352
00:14:34,054 --> 00:14:36,455
(indistinct chatter)

353
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:46,132
You hulked out on a bunch of fatties.

354
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:49,034
You're not going to make me laugh, Toby.

355
00:14:49,069 --> 00:14:51,637
What's up, kid?

356
00:14:54,274 --> 00:14:58,177
My brother is making me go to
this nightmare Hollywood party

357
00:14:58,211 --> 00:15:00,746
at his agent's house tonight.
Yeah, I went to buy a dress,

358
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,748
and nothing fit, literally nothing.

359
00:15:02,782 --> 00:15:04,550
Everything looks terrible.

360
00:15:04,584 --> 00:15:05,784
I'm not losing weight.

361
00:15:05,819 --> 00:15:07,553
I'm starving.

362
00:15:07,587 --> 00:15:09,421
I don't know.

363
00:15:09,456 --> 00:15:12,791
That's what's up, I guess.

364
00:15:12,826 --> 00:15:14,760
Okay.

365
00:15:14,794 --> 00:15:18,063
Hey, your brother's agent
is Lanie Shultz, right?

366
00:15:18,098 --> 00:15:19,698
Yeah.

367
00:15:19,733 --> 00:15:22,468
Kate, Lanie Shultz

368
00:15:22,502 --> 00:15:24,770
is one of the most powerful agents

369
00:15:24,804 --> 00:15:27,606
in what I like to call... show business.

370
00:15:27,641 --> 00:15:29,141
I heard

371
00:15:29,176 --> 00:15:31,644
that <i>Deadpool</i> was her idea.

372
00:15:31,678 --> 00:15:33,112
Or maybe it was <i>Hamilton.</i>

373
00:15:33,146 --> 00:15:34,813
I get those two confused. Anyway,

374
00:15:34,848 --> 00:15:39,018
Kate, you are so taking
me to that party.

375
00:15:39,052 --> 00:15:40,452
- Uh-uh.
- Mm-hmm.

376
00:15:40,487 --> 00:15:42,254
No. I don't want you to see me there.

377
00:15:42,289 --> 00:15:44,123
Like, I am at my worst at those things.

378
00:15:44,157 --> 00:15:46,825
Kate, you are at your worst

379
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,595
when you are eviscerating
the anorexic lady,

380
00:15:49,629 --> 00:15:52,031
and I am still standing here.

381
00:15:52,065 --> 00:15:53,832
- (sighs)
- Look,

382
00:15:53,867 --> 00:15:57,303
we have had three lunches
and four dinner dates.

383
00:15:57,337 --> 00:16:01,106
We have made out seven times
and heavy-petted twice.

384
00:16:01,141 --> 00:16:03,475
Our plane is rapidly approaching

385
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,010
the boyfriend-girlfriend zone,

386
00:16:05,045 --> 00:16:07,446
and, I, for one, am preparing
myself for landing.

387
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,948
But I need to know that everything

388
00:16:08,982 --> 00:16:11,016
isn't gonna always be about our weight.

389
00:16:11,051 --> 00:16:13,319
All right? We need to be able
to cut loose at parties.

390
00:16:13,353 --> 00:16:15,921
We need to get really dressed
up, we need to have sex.

391
00:16:15,956 --> 00:16:17,923
I just slipped that in
there very casually

392
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,325
because I think that's something

393
00:16:19,359 --> 00:16:20,960
that we should start doing very soon.

394
00:16:20,994 --> 00:16:24,430
So, Kate, I am asking you,
please, for the love of God,

395
00:16:24,464 --> 00:16:27,099
can we spend one fat-free night

396
00:16:27,133 --> 00:16:29,468
at the house of the lady
who came up with the idea

397
00:16:29,502 --> 00:16:31,136
for <i>Deadpool</i> and/or <i>Hamilton?</i>

398
00:16:32,372 --> 00:16:35,140
Is that a... is that a smile?

399
00:16:35,175 --> 00:16:35,859
(laughs)

400
00:16:35,884 --> 00:16:37,910
Is that...? Yes, that's
a yes and a smile.

401
00:16:37,944 --> 00:16:41,080
All right, hey, guys,
Bruce Banner's back.

402
00:16:41,114 --> 00:16:43,148
Everything's fine. The Hulk is gone.

403
00:16:43,183 --> 00:16:45,820
Let the healing continue.
Sorry about that.

404
00:16:50,697 --> 00:16:52,056
Are you comfy?

405
00:16:52,431 --> 00:16:54,232
Okay, sweetness.

406
00:16:54,257 --> 00:16:55,824
Good night. I love you so much.

407
00:16:55,993 --> 00:16:58,528
I love you, too.

408
00:16:58,562 --> 00:17:00,030
Mom?

409
00:17:00,064 --> 00:17:02,432
Yeah, babe?

410
00:17:02,466 --> 00:17:05,101
I only ate fruit today.

411
00:17:05,136 --> 00:17:07,537
(sighs)

412
00:17:11,151 --> 00:17:14,053
You know I just want you
to be healthy, right?

413
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:16,513
And I want you to be happy.

414
00:17:16,547 --> 00:17:18,882
Are you happy?

415
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:20,684
For the most part.

416
00:17:22,889 --> 00:17:25,291
Well, then, I'm happy, too.

417
00:17:26,424 --> 00:17:27,824
Tell you what. How about

418
00:17:27,858 --> 00:17:29,893
you and I find a healthy
balance together?

419
00:17:29,927 --> 00:17:31,661
How does that sound?

420
00:17:31,696 --> 00:17:33,463
- All right.
- RANDALL: Shut up!

421
00:17:33,497 --> 00:17:34,998
- KEVIN: You shut up, Webster.
- RANDALL: Stop calling me names!

422
00:17:35,032 --> 00:17:37,500
Goodnight. Boys?

423
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,335
Uh-uh. Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

424
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:40,570
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

425
00:17:40,604 --> 00:17:42,706
No, stop. To your beds right now.

426
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,108
- (boys groan)
- Now.

427
00:17:45,142 --> 00:17:46,876
Okay, who am I yelling at first?

428
00:17:48,312 --> 00:17:51,281
(sighs)

429
00:17:51,315 --> 00:17:54,417
Kev, bud, what is the deal? Why
are you always so hard on him?

430
00:17:54,452 --> 00:17:57,287
Everybody thinks it's weird
that we're brothers.

431
00:17:59,056 --> 00:18:01,958
You know it doesn't
matter what people think.

432
00:18:01,992 --> 00:18:03,393
He is your little brother, Kevin.

433
00:18:03,427 --> 00:18:05,028
You have to be there for one another.

434
00:18:05,062 --> 00:18:06,296
Do you hear me?

435
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:08,031
(sighs)

436
00:18:08,065 --> 00:18:09,499
Yes.

437
00:18:11,936 --> 00:18:13,203
I love you.

438
00:18:19,744 --> 00:18:21,344
(sighs)

439
00:18:21,378 --> 00:18:24,080
Can you force him be nice?

440
00:18:24,115 --> 00:18:26,883
I'll see what I can do.

441
00:18:26,917 --> 00:18:28,752
Hey.

442
00:18:28,786 --> 00:18:31,054
Promise me you'll always be good.

443
00:18:32,656 --> 00:18:34,457
I'll see what I can do.

444
00:18:34,492 --> 00:18:35,925
(soft chuckle)

445
00:18:37,261 --> 00:18:39,763
I love you.

446
00:18:39,797 --> 00:18:41,564
Now get some sleep, please.

447
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:43,066
No more fighting.

448
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,635
Don't make me come back in here.

449
00:18:45,669 --> 00:18:47,437
Good night, I love you.

450
00:18:47,471 --> 00:18:50,039
(sighs)

451
00:19:03,821 --> 00:19:06,708
- Hi, baby.
- Hi, baby.

452
00:19:10,094 --> 00:19:11,594
Did I miss putting them down?

453
00:19:12,683 --> 00:19:15,017
Just by an hour.

454
00:19:15,993 --> 00:19:18,394
Well, I was...

455
00:19:18,529 --> 00:19:20,831
I was... oh, shopping.

456
00:19:21,358 --> 00:19:22,959
I was shopping.

457
00:19:25,146 --> 00:19:28,082
I know...

458
00:19:28,296 --> 00:19:29,753
(clears throat)

459
00:19:29,778 --> 00:19:33,881
I know we haven't been
on the same page lately.

460
00:19:34,118 --> 00:19:37,754
That we just got to get
back on track, baby.

461
00:19:37,788 --> 00:19:40,256
So...

462
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:43,827
consider this a... way-too-expensive

463
00:19:43,861 --> 00:19:45,328
peace offering.

464
00:19:45,362 --> 00:19:47,997
I think we've been more than off track.

465
00:19:53,838 --> 00:19:57,473
Hey, how do you think
we're doing so far?

466
00:19:57,508 --> 00:19:59,175
At parenting?

467
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:02,345
- I...
- 'Cause I think we're at a six.

468
00:20:02,379 --> 00:20:05,248
On a sliding scale, one through ten,

469
00:20:05,282 --> 00:20:08,818
I think we're at a six and I
think I'm being generous.

470
00:20:08,853 --> 00:20:11,688
- Bec...
- Seven, fine,

471
00:20:11,722 --> 00:20:14,090
but only because there
are three of them.

472
00:20:14,124 --> 00:20:15,892
- Baby, I...
- And the thing is,

473
00:20:15,926 --> 00:20:19,429
I'm trying really hard
to get us to a nine.

474
00:20:19,463 --> 00:20:22,365
Because they are cute kids, and
they deserve nine-parents.

475
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:27,237
And, the thing is, I feel
like I'm there, Jack.

476
00:20:28,806 --> 00:20:32,542
I feel like I'm operating at a nine.

477
00:20:32,576 --> 00:20:36,913
Because I do individualized lunches

478
00:20:36,947 --> 00:20:39,249
and I do individualized
tuck-ins for each kid

479
00:20:39,283 --> 00:20:40,984
so nobody feels gypped.

480
00:20:41,018 --> 00:20:42,552
And...

481
00:20:42,586 --> 00:20:43,820
(scoffs)

482
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:51,227
When you're home, and you're you,

483
00:20:51,262 --> 00:20:54,264
you're way better than I am.

484
00:20:54,298 --> 00:20:58,801
You're a ten when you're you, Jack.

485
00:20:58,836 --> 00:21:01,771
But you're getting home later and later

486
00:21:01,805 --> 00:21:03,606
- and when you do come home, you're...
- Bec, what are you saying?

487
00:21:03,641 --> 00:21:05,475
The drinking has to stop.

488
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:13,275
You have to reign it in, baby,
because I won't have it in my house.

489
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:17,036
You won't have it in your house.
- I won't.

490
00:21:17,288 --> 00:21:22,458
So if it's a problem, fix it.
Be a man, and fix it.

491
00:21:22,493 --> 00:21:25,962
Because I'm done letting
you lower our score.

492
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,264
Damn.

493
00:21:40,298 --> 00:21:42,266
- Yeah?
- (chuckling): Yeah.

494
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,767
Hell to the yeah.

495
00:21:43,801 --> 00:21:45,535
- Thanks.
- (chuckling)

496
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46,803
You look dapper.

497
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:48,372
Ah, show business.

498
00:21:48,406 --> 00:21:49,940
Oh, great, you're, uh...

499
00:21:49,974 --> 00:21:51,341
We got to go, you know?

500
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:53,110
- 'Cause we're gonna be late.
- Okay.

501
00:21:53,144 --> 00:21:54,311
You're wearing that?

502
00:21:54,345 --> 00:21:55,345
Yeah.

503
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,481
That's great.

504
00:21:57,515 --> 00:21:59,483
- You look awesome.
- Oh, is the hat too much?

505
00:21:59,517 --> 00:22:01,084
The hat is everything.

506
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:03,320
Yeah, that's a real peacock feather.

507
00:22:03,354 --> 00:22:05,756

00:23:14,959 --> 00:23:19,196
- (phone rings, then machine beeps)
- Jack, It's Miguel.

531
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,897
It's late, so I'm leaving
you a message at the office

532
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:22,733
in case I miss you in the morning.

533
00:23:22,767 --> 00:23:27,237
Feel like I overstepped before.

534
00:23:27,271 --> 00:23:30,107
Um, you know I love you,
you know I love you guys.

535
00:23:30,141 --> 00:23:31,908
Hell... (chuckles)

536
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:34,544
<i>I'm jealous of your
relationship, if anything.</i>

537
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:37,280
Uh, I shouldn't have said
anything at the bar.

538
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:38,615
Now I'm just overdoing it.

539
00:23:38,649 --> 00:23:40,217
Uh...

540
00:23:40,251 --> 00:23:42,619
Okay. Bye.

541
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:49,993
BETH: Hey.

542
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:51,962
You need to get some sleep, it's late.

543
00:23:51,996 --> 00:23:53,563
You've been up since,
like, 4:00 this morning.

544
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:57,367
No, I know. Just five more minutes.

545
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,003
(machine beeps)

546
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:02,606
- (treadmill slows to a stop)
- Hey.

547
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,208
Shower. Sleep.

548
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:07,544
Now.

549
00:24:07,578 --> 00:24:11,448
You shower quick, you can work off that
last five minutes a different way.

550
00:24:11,482 --> 00:24:13,316
(panting)

551
00:24:18,489 --> 00:24:21,558
I am so happy that we
could all get together.

552
00:24:21,592 --> 00:24:23,660
You know, work through, and...

553
00:24:23,694 --> 00:24:25,595
(stammers): and... Kevin
just feels awful...

554
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:29,066
I'm so sorry, this is whole
thing, Lanie, is ridiculous.

555
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,568
I mean...

556
00:24:31,602 --> 00:24:34,137
Mr. Manning.

557
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:35,772
I'm truly grateful for everything

558
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,341
that your network has done for me, I am.

559
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:41,144
But please let me go with God, sir.

560
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:43,413
The way I handled myself,

561
00:24:43,448 --> 00:24:45,849
I mean, that was wrong, I'll be
the first one to admit that.

562
00:24:45,883 --> 00:24:48,819
That-that was wrong.

563
00:24:48,853 --> 00:24:52,689
But can't we all, at this point,
just, sort of, you know...

564
00:24:52,723 --> 00:24:54,925
sort of move on, right?

565
00:24:57,261 --> 00:24:59,596
You're a good kid, Kevin.

566
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:01,786
- I appreciate your honesty.
- Thank you.

567
00:25:01,811 --> 00:25:06,881
The show, it's a solid performer, but
it's not the biggest thing on my network.

568
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:09,272
Without Lanie telling me,

569
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:12,275
would I have known you
from one of these waiters

570
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:14,978
passing around the chicken skewers?

571
00:25:15,012 --> 00:25:17,814
- Probably not.
- Really?

572
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,916
I really don't care what
happens behind the scenes

573
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:22,953
on my third-rated sitcom.

574
00:25:22,987 --> 00:25:24,688
You know what I do care about?

575
00:25:24,722 --> 00:25:26,323
KEVIN: Mm-mm.

576
00:25:26,357 --> 00:25:27,791
St. Maarten, Kevin.

577
00:25:27,825 --> 00:25:31,194
I'm building a home in St. Maarten

578
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:34,197
and in two years I'm going to retire,

579
00:25:34,232 --> 00:25:37,467
and my favorite wife and I
are going to move there.

580
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:39,703
Until then,

581
00:25:39,737 --> 00:25:42,472
I plan on just drifting
through these two years

582
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:46,543
as painlessly and
drama-free as possible.

583
00:25:46,577 --> 00:25:48,845
Like I'm on morphine, Kevin,

584
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,849
that's how I'll be drifting
through those years.

585
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:58,522
Okay.

586
00:25:58,556 --> 00:26:02,225
That's... great, you know?

587
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,693
Go with God.

588
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:08,884
You know, the thing is...
excuse me darling.

589
00:26:08,909 --> 00:26:09,890
(Lanie chuckles)

590
00:26:09,915 --> 00:26:13,918
Recasting the lead on a hit sitcom,

591
00:26:13,943 --> 00:26:18,179
isn't exactly drifting on
morphine, now is it, Kevin?

592
00:26:19,219 --> 00:26:23,354
So unfortunately, my boy, you're
not gonna be leaving the show.

593
00:26:24,186 --> 00:26:29,123
If you do, I'll be forced to
Nagasaki your life and career.

594
00:26:29,353 --> 00:26:33,557
Hey, have you ever heard of the
actor, uh, Taylor Jennings?

595
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:35,025
I'm not familiar with the name.

596
00:26:35,059 --> 00:26:36,560
I Nagasaki'd him.

597
00:26:38,462 --> 00:26:41,031
So take the money, kid.

598
00:26:41,065 --> 00:26:44,267
Ride out the next couple
years, all right?

599
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:46,469
Otherwise, I'll make you
a bigger laughingstock

600
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:48,438
than you already are.

601
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:53,310
Deal?

602
00:26:53,344 --> 00:26:56,213
I'm sorry, I'm j... I'm gonna go, uh...

603
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:58,748
my sister's here, I'm
gonna go check on her.

604
00:27:01,789 --> 00:27:03,312
It's his twin sister.

605
00:27:05,356 --> 00:27:06,957
Big girl.

606
00:27:06,991 --> 00:27:08,625

607
00:27:08,659 --> 00:27:09,926

608
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,194
(Toby laughs, glass splashes in pool)

609
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:12,596
(giggles)

610
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,232
- You love drunk Kate.
- I love drunk Kate.

611
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:16,766
Wait, what?

612
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,034
- Woo!
- Hey.

613
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:19,269
Hey!

614
00:27:19,303 --> 00:27:21,304
How'd it go? I'm wasted.

615
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:22,639
Not good.

616
00:27:22,673 --> 00:27:24,374
Good? Oh, my God, that's great.

617
00:27:24,408 --> 00:27:26,076
No, no, no, no, <i>not</i> good.

618
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,544
It did not... I don't
know what I'm gonna do.

619
00:27:27,578 --> 00:27:29,546
- (imitates fishing reel)
- Uh-oh!

620
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,414
- Gone fishing.
- You caught a whopper!

621
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:33,984
Uh-oh. (grunting)

622
00:27:34,018 --> 00:27:36,219
Come reel me in, got to reel me in.

623
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:38,622
(grunts) It's my first time fishing.

624
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:40,957
- Won't be his last.
- Well...

00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,159

- Kev!

627
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:53,670
Which little monster's
standing at my door?

628
00:27:53,704 --> 00:27:57,340
It's okay, I'm way too old
to be scared of monsters.

629
00:28:01,445 --> 00:28:04,281
I think it's time you and I had a talk.

630
00:28:10,521 --> 00:28:12,522
(indistinct conversations)

631
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:32,509
(bus door opens,
children chatter, laugh)

632
00:28:37,181 --> 00:28:39,282
I can't wait until the
next day of school starts.

633
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:41,551
Hey, everyone, it's Webster!

634
00:28:41,585 --> 00:28:43,019
(children laughing and taunting)

635
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:48,725
BULLY: Kev,

636
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:50,026
come on, Kevin, ditch Webster.

637
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,494
Let's go.

638
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:54,064
Come on.

639
00:28:55,766 --> 00:28:57,767
(phone vibrating)

640
00:29:00,871 --> 00:29:04,441
(phone beeps)

641
00:29:04,475 --> 00:29:05,675
Hey.

642
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:07,010
Hey.

643
00:29:07,044 --> 00:29:08,778
Hey, uh... is it too late out there?

644
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:10,213
I know you're usually up late, right?

645
00:29:10,247 --> 00:29:12,382
- No, I was just, uh...
- (clears throat)

646
00:29:12,416 --> 00:29:14,017
catching up on some paperwork.

647
00:29:14,051 --> 00:29:15,685
Sweet, uh...

648
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,520
Hey, listen, I-I know I've
owed you a phone call

649
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:19,122
since everything went down,

650
00:29:19,156 --> 00:29:20,657
it's been crazy out here, just...
you know.

651
00:29:20,691 --> 00:29:22,058
No, it's all good.

652
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,929
Kate's kept me up to speed.

653
00:29:23,954 --> 00:29:25,955
Good.

654
00:29:31,869 --> 00:29:34,337
They said they're not gonna
let me out of the show, man.

655
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:36,172
And I...

656
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:38,174
I don't know what I'm gonna do, like...

657
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:40,744
they locked me in for two
more years, maybe more.

658
00:29:40,778 --> 00:29:42,679
Damn.

659
00:29:42,713 --> 00:29:44,080
Well, what are you gonna do?

660
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:46,616
I was kind of hoping you'd tell me.

661
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:50,120
Oh, because you care what I think?

662
00:29:50,154 --> 00:29:52,922
Because I care what
everyone thinks, man.

663
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:54,491
You know that.

664
00:29:56,694 --> 00:30:00,730
I was not a very good
brother to you, was I?

665
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:02,098
No, you weren't.

666
00:30:03,897 --> 00:30:05,931
But you've still got time.

667
00:30:06,036 --> 00:30:08,304
KATE (giggling): Hey!

668
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:10,140
Yeah, uh...

669
00:30:10,174 --> 00:30:12,342
Anyway, look, it's getting
late, man, I, you know...

670
00:30:12,376 --> 00:30:13,610
I probably should go.

671
00:30:13,644 --> 00:30:16,846
It's, uh... Kate's here, it's Randall.

672
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:18,948
- Oh, hey, Randall!
- Hey.

673
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:21,451
Anyway, yeah, I-I should probably, uh...

674
00:30:21,485 --> 00:30:23,086
I got to go back inside and
sell my soul to the network,

675
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,131
like the whore that I am.

676
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:25,456
Hey, Kev.

677
00:30:29,069 --> 00:30:30,336
Deep breath, okay?

678
00:30:32,862 --> 00:30:35,197
Come on, man. First came...

679
00:30:37,244 --> 00:30:38,478
Me.

680
00:30:38,512 --> 00:30:39,979
And Dad said...

681
00:30:40,014 --> 00:30:41,414
"Gee."

682
00:30:44,785 --> 00:30:46,152
- And then came...
- Me!

683
00:30:46,186 --> 00:30:47,387
And Mom said...

684
00:30:47,421 --> 00:30:49,022
- "Whee!"
- And then came...

685
00:30:49,056 --> 00:30:50,356
- Me.
- And they said...

686
00:30:50,391 --> 00:30:51,391
"That's three."

687
00:30:51,425 --> 00:30:53,993
- Big Three!
- ALL: Big Three!

688
00:30:54,028 --> 00:30:56,229
KATE (laughing): Yeah.

689
00:31:02,336 --> 00:31:04,003
You good?

690
00:31:04,038 --> 00:31:06,506
Uh... yeah.

691
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:09,575
Yeah, I'm good, I'm good.

692
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:11,878
- Kevin?
- Yeah?

693
00:31:11,912 --> 00:31:15,181
Mom and Dad didn't raise no whores.

694
00:31:15,215 --> 00:31:18,384
Except briefly, during
Kate's eyeliner phase.

695
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:20,586
(chuckles)

696
00:31:20,621 --> 00:31:23,256
(sniffs) Yeah.

697
00:31:25,943 --> 00:31:28,695
Night, little brother.

698
00:31:28,729 --> 00:31:31,364
Night, big brother.

699
00:31:34,335 --> 00:31:35,601
(phone beeps)

700
00:31:39,907 --> 00:31:41,774
Hon?

701
00:31:41,809 --> 00:31:43,209
- There you go.
- Thank you.

702
00:31:43,243 --> 00:31:45,044
Mm-hmm.

703
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:48,581
Can I cut to the chase?

704
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:50,083
It's your meeting.

705
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:52,118
(chuckles)

706
00:31:53,854 --> 00:31:57,657
Eight years ago, I was, um,
pregnant for the first time.

707
00:31:57,691 --> 00:32:01,227
And Randall was vying for
partner at his firm.

708
00:32:01,261 --> 00:32:04,330
We'd just bought this house on faith,

709
00:32:04,365 --> 00:32:06,766
even though it needed a lot of work,

710
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:10,903
even though we couldn't
afford it whatsoever.

711
00:32:10,938 --> 00:32:13,072
Then Randall made partner.

712
00:32:13,107 --> 00:32:15,541
He did all the work
on the house himself,

713
00:32:15,576 --> 00:32:17,443
so we didn't have to spend a penny.

714
00:32:17,478 --> 00:32:21,614
And he made sure I didn't lift
a finger during my pregnancy.

715
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:22,882
He's a good man.

716
00:32:22,916 --> 00:32:25,084
No, he's not good.

717
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:27,754
He's perfect.

718
00:32:27,788 --> 00:32:30,390
Problem is, he stopped sleeping.

719
00:32:30,424 --> 00:32:33,726
And then one morning, I
was in the bathroom,

720
00:32:33,761 --> 00:32:37,096
and he called out to me.

721
00:32:37,131 --> 00:32:38,765
And he was confused, you know?

722
00:32:40,768 --> 00:32:42,535
He was confused because he...

723
00:32:43,637 --> 00:32:45,638
couldn't see anything.

724
00:32:47,641 --> 00:32:52,512
My husband... my mountain of a man...

725
00:32:52,546 --> 00:32:57,517
could literally no longer see
things through his eyes.

726
00:32:57,551 --> 00:32:59,919
It was as if 28 years
of being that perfect

727
00:32:59,953 --> 00:33:02,255
had all caught up to him that morning.

728
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:06,626
And he, um...

729
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:09,595
he pulled himself out of it.

730
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:13,132
He self-corrected,

731
00:33:13,167 --> 00:33:15,168
'cause that's what my man does.

732
00:33:18,005 --> 00:33:22,775
Randall is not free of vice, William.

733
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:25,978
His vice is his goodness.

734
00:33:26,013 --> 00:33:28,481
It's his compulsive drive

735
00:33:28,515 --> 00:33:31,484
to be perfect.

736
00:33:31,518 --> 00:33:35,555
It's why I love him...

737
00:33:35,589 --> 00:33:39,959
but it's also why I have to
protect him sometimes, you know?

738
00:33:39,993 --> 00:33:43,629
So now, I'm gonna have to
ask you a couple questions,

739
00:33:43,664 --> 00:33:48,768
questions he would probably
be too polite to ask himself.

740
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:52,205
Ask away.

741
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:54,841
(inhales sharply) The money you borrow.

742
00:33:54,875 --> 00:33:57,510
You use it for the bus?

743
00:33:57,544 --> 00:33:59,445
Yes.

744
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,281
Where do you go?

745
00:34:02,316 --> 00:34:05,818
You're gone all day, every day.

746
00:34:05,853 --> 00:34:09,822
My place in Philadelphia,
it's a long ride.

747
00:34:09,857 --> 00:34:11,691
Why?

748
00:34:11,725 --> 00:34:13,292
Are you using drugs?

749
00:34:13,327 --> 00:34:15,161
- Are you getting drugs?
- Mm-mm. No.

750
00:34:16,196 --> 00:34:17,864
Are you really sick?

751
00:34:18,899 --> 00:34:21,367
Yes, I am.

752
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:26,939
Beth, I said it before,
and I really meant it:

753
00:34:26,974 --> 00:34:28,875
if I'm overstaying my welcome,

754
00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:30,443
I wish you would just say it.

755
00:34:31,478 --> 00:34:34,714
William, you are overstaying...

756
00:34:34,748 --> 00:34:36,449
RANDALL: Beth.

757
00:34:36,483 --> 00:34:38,084
What are you doing?

758
00:34:38,118 --> 00:34:40,052
Somebody has to ask the
questions here, baby...

759
00:34:40,087 --> 00:34:42,088
It's a cat.

760
00:34:43,259 --> 00:34:45,493
I have a cat.

761
00:34:45,826 --> 00:34:48,961
It's all I really have.

762
00:34:49,863 --> 00:34:51,697
His name's Clooney.

763
00:34:51,732 --> 00:34:56,102
One of those ironic names,
'cause he's a pretty ugly cat.

764
00:34:56,136 --> 00:34:58,671
I go back and forth to feed him.

765
00:34:58,705 --> 00:35:01,207
Three hours on the bus each day.

766
00:35:01,241 --> 00:35:03,943
Why wouldn't you just
tell us you had a cat?

767
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:05,244
Nah.

768
00:35:05,279 --> 00:35:06,779
The little one has asthma

769
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:08,214
and I knew if I brought up the cat,

770
00:35:08,248 --> 00:35:10,716
you'd tell me to bring it,
that would cause problems.

771
00:35:10,751 --> 00:35:12,418
And I don't want to cause any problems,

772
00:35:12,452 --> 00:35:13,953
'cause if I cause problems,
I'd have to leave.

773
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:16,830
And... and I don't want to leave.

774
00:35:18,058 --> 00:35:21,561
Six months ago, some doctor
told me I had three to live.

775
00:35:21,595 --> 00:35:24,730
But for some reason, I
don't feel so bad lately.

776
00:35:24,765 --> 00:35:27,233
Maybe to do with this house.

777
00:35:27,267 --> 00:35:29,902
I don't know.

778
00:35:29,937 --> 00:35:32,939
Truth is, I'd never thought I'd
have anything to care about again

779
00:35:32,973 --> 00:35:35,174
besides an ugly cat, so...

780
00:35:39,862 --> 00:35:42,163
Well, now I feel like a bitch.

781
00:35:42,316 --> 00:35:43,616
(Randall laughs)

782
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:44,817
(William chuckles)

783
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:47,086
It's not funny. It's not.

784
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,821
(chuckling) It's not funny.

785
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:50,356
(laughing continues)

786
00:35:52,923 --> 00:35:54,142
I'm about...

787
00:35:54,603 --> 00:35:57,314
****

788
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,021
Mm.

789
00:35:59,055 --> 00:36:00,822
Are you gonna hold my hair for me, Toby?

790
00:36:00,857 --> 00:36:02,991
No. I-I'm still gonna be at this party,

791
00:36:03,026 --> 00:36:04,626
trying to bang a Gilmore Girl.

792
00:36:04,661 --> 00:36:06,395
(laughs)

793
00:36:06,429 --> 00:36:08,397
Well, go for both.

794
00:36:08,431 --> 00:36:10,766
Gil-more the Gil-merrier.

795
00:36:16,506 --> 00:36:20,776
It's always gonna be about
the weight for me, Toby.

796
00:36:21,744 --> 00:36:23,412
(sniffs)

797
00:36:23,446 --> 00:36:25,847
It's been my story ever
since I was a little girl.

798
00:36:28,685 --> 00:36:31,019
And every moment that I'm
not thinking about it,

799
00:36:31,054 --> 00:36:32,921
I'm thinking about it.

800
00:36:32,955 --> 00:36:34,723
Like...

801
00:36:34,757 --> 00:36:36,591
will this chair hold me?

802
00:36:36,626 --> 00:36:39,561
Will this dress fit me?

803
00:36:39,595 --> 00:36:42,731
And if I ever get pregnant, would...

804
00:36:42,765 --> 00:36:44,966
will anyone ever notice?

805
00:36:49,972 --> 00:36:52,474
It's just at the core of who
I am, it's just deep inside,

806
00:36:52,508 --> 00:36:55,310
and eight tequila shots can only
mask that for a couple hours.

807
00:36:55,345 --> 00:36:57,179
- So...
- I know.

808
00:36:59,749 --> 00:37:01,663
And it was ten tequila shots,

809
00:37:01,688 --> 00:37:05,357
but I... I get it. I know.

810
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,514
And just for the record,

811
00:37:08,791 --> 00:37:13,795
um, this dress is fitting you
in all the right places.

812
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:14,796
(purring)

813
00:37:14,831 --> 00:37:17,232
- This old thing?
- Uh-huh.

814
00:37:17,266 --> 00:37:18,467
I mean, I-I just threw it on.

815
00:37:18,501 --> 00:37:19,768
Oh, you just threw it on? Mm-hmm.

816
00:37:19,802 --> 00:37:21,036
I didn't even think about it.

817
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:23,805
(chuckles)

818
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,273
(sighs)

819
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:28,643
There he is.

820
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,248
I told 'em to go screw themselves.

821
00:37:33,282 --> 00:37:35,584
And what'd they say?

822
00:37:36,619 --> 00:37:38,920
A lot of mean, scary things.

823
00:37:43,659 --> 00:37:46,361
I'm gonna do theater.

824
00:37:46,396 --> 00:37:48,029
You know?

825
00:37:49,031 --> 00:37:51,366
I'm moving to New York.

826
00:37:55,805 --> 00:37:58,173
(whispering): Show business.

827
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:10,419
(sighs) What are you doing out here?

828
00:38:13,623 --> 00:38:16,491
I don't like sleeping far away from you.

829
00:38:19,328 --> 00:38:21,096
No more drinking.

830
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:23,598
- You can't just stop...
- I can.

831
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:25,891
For you, I can.

832
00:38:27,069 --> 00:38:28,770
I will.

833
00:38:28,805 --> 00:38:31,072
(sighs)

834
00:38:33,242 --> 00:38:34,943
You know, when I was a little boy,

835
00:38:34,977 --> 00:38:38,680
I didn't know what I wanted
to be when I grew up.

836
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:42,651
(inhales, exhales deeply)

837
00:38:42,685 --> 00:38:46,488
Adults always ask little kids that.

838
00:38:48,791 --> 00:38:50,525
You know?

839
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,094
I never had a good answer.

840
00:38:53,129 --> 00:38:55,897
Not until... not until I was 28.

841
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:59,295
Till the day that I met you.

842
00:39:01,276 --> 00:39:05,412
That's when I knew exactly what
I wanted to be when I grew up:

843
00:39:07,677 --> 00:39:10,078
I wanted to be the man
that made you happy.

844
00:39:12,148 --> 00:39:14,483
(sighs)

845
00:39:14,517 --> 00:39:16,184
You make me happy.

846
00:39:16,219 --> 00:39:18,119
Not always.

847
00:39:18,154 --> 00:39:20,922
(scoffs) Not lately.

848
00:39:25,224 --> 00:39:29,065
From here on out, I'm gonna
be an 11 for you, baby.

849
00:39:31,601 --> 00:39:34,035
No...

850
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:36,705
Screw that.

851
00:39:36,739 --> 00:39:41,209
I'm gonna be a 12 for
you, from here out.

852
00:39:41,244 --> 00:39:44,546
I'll be an 11 for the kids,

853
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:46,047
but you get a 12.

854
00:39:51,988 --> 00:39:53,955
Do you forgive me?

855
00:39:56,025 --> 00:39:59,661
You slept outside our bedroom
door like a Labrador.

856
00:40:01,998 --> 00:40:04,132
Of course I forgive you.

857
00:40:10,506 --> 00:40:12,274
Can I still give you my gift?

858
00:40:13,309 --> 00:40:15,310
