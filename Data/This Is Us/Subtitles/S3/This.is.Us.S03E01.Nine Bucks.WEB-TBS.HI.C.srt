00:09:36,914 --> 00:09:39,016
Your brother and my cousin
are knockin' boots.

182
00:09:39,859 --> 00:09:40,908
What you talking about, Beth?

183
00:09:40,933 --> 00:09:42,400
It's an expression from the '90s.

184
00:09:42,425 --> 00:09:43,597
It means that they are having sex.

185
00:09:43,622 --> 00:09:45,218
I'm familiar with the expression, woman.

186
00:09:45,243 --> 00:09:47,101
I'm just asking why are you so positive?

187
00:09:47,126 --> 00:09:48,593
- Because I know.
- But you don't.

188
00:09:48,627 --> 00:09:50,261
- You need to talk to him.
- And say what?

189
00:09:50,304 --> 00:09:51,695
Tell him to "get the hell
off of Beth's cousin

190
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,983
before I kill you in the face."

191
00:09:53,008 --> 00:09:54,465
I will say no such thing,

192
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,701
especially when we have
no evidence to prove it.

193
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:59,140
And I need you to swear that
you won't say anything tonight.

194
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:01,328
- (CHUCKLES)
- Hey-hey-hey, it is my birthday.

195
00:10:01,549 --> 00:10:04,125
And I need you to swear to it on Oprah.

196
00:10:05,758 --> 00:10:07,695
- I'm not doing that.
- Beth.

197
00:10:09,581 --> 00:10:12,820
Fine. I will swear on Oprah.

198
00:10:14,476 --> 00:10:15,726
Thank you.

199
00:10:16,099 --> 00:10:18,859
Hey, Deja, come on, let's take a ride.

200
00:10:27,647 --> 00:10:29,711
Even Gayle let Oprah down sometimes.

201
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,936
Heard it was your birthday.
What are you turning?

202
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,890
Oh, yeah, I'm turning
30-none-of-your-business.

203
00:10:33,915 --> 00:10:35,593
That's how old I'm turning. Thank you.

204
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,265
Few of my colleagues screened
the movie last night.

205
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:38,576
They were raving about it.

206
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:39,734
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

207
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:41,712
Oh, man, I hope so.
I haven't seen it yet.

208
00:10:41,747 --> 00:10:44,154
You know, truth be told,
I'm, uh, scared to see it.

209
00:10:44,179 --> 00:10:45,623
I'm just gonna wait
till the premiere next week.

210
00:10:45,648 --> 00:10:47,985
I'm gonna watch it then
and just rip the Band-Aid off.

211

(PHONE VIBRATING)

212
00:10:49,321 --> 00:10:50,898
- Do you mind if I...?
- Sure. Go ahead.

213
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:52,554
- Is that okay? I'll be right back. Okay.
- Yeah.

214
00:10:54,016 --> 00:10:57,126
Hey. So, what am I, just an
afternoon booty call to you?

215
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,195
Because that would be amazing.

216
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,854
You can't come
to your birthday party tonight.

217
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:01,203
- Oh, um...
- (SCOFFS)

218
00:11:01,387 --> 00:11:03,992
If she sees us together,
Beth is gonna figure it out.

219
00:11:04,017 --> 00:11:05,751
She's already been sniffing things out.

220
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:08,034
She is like a secret bloodhound.

221
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:09,802
Meaning she sniffs out secrets
like a bloodhound,

222
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:11,445
or she's actually secretly a bloodhound?

223
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,872
- You have to cancel.
- I'm not canceling.

224
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:14,273
This is my birthday party, okay?

225
00:11:14,308 --> 00:11:15,734
I'm not canceling... you cancel.

226
00:11:16,547 --> 00:11:19,579
Okay. No touching,

227
00:11:19,613 --> 00:11:22,133
no flirting, and, um,
don't do that thing

228
00:11:22,158 --> 00:11:23,649
where you half smile,
'cause automatically,

229
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:25,195
it makes me full smile, and she'll see.

230
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,383
Fine. But you know what?
You can't dress all crazy, okay?

231
00:11:27,408 --> 00:11:29,956
Because for some reason, the
more you dress like Mia Farrow,

232
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,224
the hotter I get.

233
00:11:31,437 --> 00:11:33,398
- Fine.
- Fine.

234
00:11:34,328 --> 00:11:35,365
Oh, and you know what?

235
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,662
Don't talk about your weird documentary.

236
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:38,609
Okay? Because it makes
you sound really smart,

237
00:11:38,663 --> 00:11:40,931
and when you sound really smart,
I half smile,

238
00:11:40,956 --> 00:11:43,218
and when I half smile,
it makes you full smile.

239
00:11:43,243 --> 00:11:45,570
You hung up on "fine," didn't you?

240
00:11:46,844 --> 00:11:49,445
Yeah, you did. Hung up on "fine."

241
00:11:50,571 --> 00:11:51,758
Fine.

I am writing down key words
so I can remember stuff.

245
00:12:06,523 --> 00:12:09,529
As you can see, I have
polycystic ovary syndrome.

246
00:12:09,726 --> 00:12:10,963
- And Toby...
- Yeah.

247
00:12:10,998 --> 00:12:13,966
I-I <i>have</i> sperm, just not a lot of them.

248
00:12:14,001 --> 00:12:16,969
You know, and none of them are
breaking 40-yard dash records

249
00:12:17,004 --> 00:12:19,171
at the NFL Combine,
if you know what I'm saying.

250
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:20,806
You've been on the
antidepressant how long?

251
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:22,008
Uh, six years.

252
00:12:22,929 --> 00:12:23,943
Well, it's possible

253
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:25,547
they're causing
the decreased sperm count.

254
00:12:25,572 --> 00:12:28,014
Uh, it's also possible
that they're preventing me

255
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:29,649
from crying all the time, so...

Look, Doc, this is why we're
here, okay? To start IVF.

You are the best and Kate is the best

260
00:12:40,172 --> 00:12:41,656
and I am the best.

261

- (GIGGLES)
- So...

262
00:12:45,195 --> 00:12:47,914
Um, it's my 38th birthday,

263
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:51,820
and sometimes, I swear, I can
hear the clock just ticking.

264
00:12:52,695 --> 00:12:55,041
Uh, but when we got
this appointment with you,

265
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:57,376
on my birthday no less,

266
00:12:57,411 --> 00:13:00,746
I feel like the universe
just intervened.

267
00:13:02,734 --> 00:13:04,584
I know this isn't what you want to hear,

268
00:13:05,054 --> 00:13:09,140
but I'm not going to be able
to take you on as a patient.

269
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:12,959
Wh-What? Why?

270
00:13:13,468 --> 00:13:17,196
At your weight, the chances of a
successful pregnancy are very slim,

271
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,065
even if you go through in vitro.

272
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:23,047
Yeah, we know. And we don't
care, and we, we want to try.

273
00:13:23,781 --> 00:13:25,204
And I admire that.

274
00:13:25,695 --> 00:13:28,841
But egg retrieval is invasive.

275
00:13:29,148 --> 00:13:31,944
At your BMI, going under anesthesia

276
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:34,553
for an elective procedure
is not advisable.

277
00:13:34,578 --> 00:13:36,015
Yeah, we know all the risks.

278
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:38,584
We've talked about it for hours on end.

279
00:13:39,437 --> 00:13:43,148
All right? But we, we want
to take our chances.

280
00:13:43,968 --> 00:13:46,025
It's not just up to me, unfortunately.

281
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:49,729
I have partners at my practice,
there are liability issues.

282
00:13:50,343 --> 00:13:52,648
I'm not gonna be able
to help you here, Kate.

283
00:13:53,531 --> 00:13:55,401
And I fear you'll be hard-pressed

284
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:57,039
to find anyone who will.

285

a birthday brunch, so...

really nice to meet you.

for a carnival type of guy.

- I lost a baby tooth in a candy apple...
- Uh-huh?

underneath my pillow

My mother was furious,

312

I ruined a set of pillowcases.

00:17:00,049 --> 00:17:02,330
It's not the first time
I caught a bad break.

353
00:17:06,685 --> 00:17:08,486
- (LOW CHATTER)
- Hey. Hi.

354
00:17:08,721 --> 00:17:10,143
ALL: Hi!

355
00:17:10,233 --> 00:17:11,588
♪

356
00:17:26,522 --> 00:17:29,127
RANDALL: <i>Okay. We're here.</i>

357
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:42,679
So...

358
00:17:42,704 --> 00:17:45,273
this is the apartment building
Beth and I bought last year.

359
00:17:46,406 --> 00:17:48,843
It's where I found my biological father.

360
00:17:50,789 --> 00:17:53,156
Knocked on the door
of that building two years ago.

361
00:17:54,054 --> 00:17:55,570
Two years ago to the day.

362
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,414
Came in hot, too.

363
00:17:57,656 --> 00:17:59,815
Banging on that mug
like a Real Housewife,

364
00:17:59,849 --> 00:18:02,054
ready to throw down,
you know what I'm saying?

365
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:05,672
You see, my father...
my biological father...

366
00:18:06,691 --> 00:18:08,890
was standing on the other side
of that door.

367
00:18:11,181 --> 00:18:13,172
Wound up getting
less than a year with him.

368
00:18:14,703 --> 00:18:17,687
I found him, then I lost him
all over again.

369
00:18:19,156 --> 00:18:20,402
Then I bought his building.

370
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:23,538
Guess you don't have to drop
a hundo an hour on a therapist

371
00:18:23,573 --> 00:18:25,140
to crack that case, huh?

372
00:18:25,174 --> 00:18:26,375
(LAUGHS SOFTLY)

373
00:18:31,758 --> 00:18:34,750
It has defined my life, being adopted.

374
00:18:35,937 --> 00:18:38,153
It's defined my life,
even when I didn't realize

375
00:18:38,187 --> 00:18:39,351
it was defining it.

376
00:18:39,822 --> 00:18:43,445
And I think the part of that,
at least for me,

377
00:18:44,594 --> 00:18:47,396
is that this big giant thing
happened to me,

378
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:49,148
and I didn't have any say in it.

379
00:18:50,773 --> 00:18:52,734
And I don't want that
to be the case for you.

380
00:18:58,945 --> 00:19:01,031
Deja, we'd like to formally adopt you.

381
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:05,847
They're saying we can't
foster you forever,

382
00:19:05,882 --> 00:19:08,289
that we got to sign some papers
and start a process.

383
00:19:09,289 --> 00:19:11,679
And as much as we would love that,

384
00:19:12,407 --> 00:19:14,808
we don't want it to happen
unless it's your choice.

385
00:19:17,711 --> 00:19:19,414
You want me to say something, I know.

386
00:19:19,439 --> 00:19:21,351
No, I'm okay with whatever you decide,

387
00:19:21,515 --> 00:19:23,332
just as long as it's your choice.

388
00:19:23,366 --> 00:19:24,734
(LAUGHS SOFTLY) My choice.

389
00:19:27,346 --> 00:19:31,101
Look, you're a very nice person

390
00:19:31,674 --> 00:19:34,476
and you have a very nice family,

391
00:19:34,533 --> 00:19:39,070
and I'm real grateful for...
what you've done for me,

392
00:19:40,428 --> 00:19:43,819
but when you try and pretend
like we're the same...

393
00:19:43,853 --> 00:19:45,586
- I'm not trying to pretend...
- You're not?

394
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,390
'Cause I feel like we just drove an hour

395
00:19:48,424 --> 00:19:50,961
just so you could show me
how the same we are.

396
00:19:53,429 --> 00:19:56,445
You had one family your whole life.

397
00:19:57,593 --> 00:19:59,992
Two dads who loved you.

398
00:20:01,109 --> 00:20:03,734
I had one dad who never wanted me.

399
00:20:04,883 --> 00:20:06,961
One mom who left me.

400
00:20:07,877 --> 00:20:10,562
So don't tell me
we're the same, Randall.

401
00:20:12,101 --> 00:20:15,156
Don't tell me that I have
a choice in anything.

402
00:20:20,029 --> 00:20:22,000
I'd like to leave now if that's okay.

403
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,195
I'm sorry to keep rambling.

404
00:20:33,297 --> 00:20:35,218
Will you please tell me
something about you?

405
00:20:35,328 --> 00:20:37,920
Like, I don't even know what do you do.

406
00:20:38,469 --> 00:20:40,926
I'm kind of in between jobs right now.

407
00:20:40,951 --> 00:20:42,098
- Mm-hmm.
- I just...

408
00:20:42,123 --> 00:20:44,160
I just... I got, I got back from Vietnam

409
00:20:44,185 --> 00:20:45,361
- not too long ago.
- Really?

410
00:20:45,386 --> 00:20:46,929
- Yeah.
- Wow.

411
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,021
Yeah.

412
00:20:48,488 --> 00:20:50,590
Oh, God, was it just awful?

413
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:53,666
I mean, of course it was.

414
00:20:53,691 --> 00:20:54,930
I'm so sorry that I asked.

415
00:20:54,955 --> 00:20:56,558
No, no. No, no, no.

416
00:21:02,675 --> 00:21:04,270
I was just a mechanic.

417
00:21:06,027 --> 00:21:07,277
- Huh.
- Yeah.

418
00:21:08,209 --> 00:21:10,871
Do you have any siblings?

419
00:21:12,715 --> 00:21:14,144
I had a brother.

420
00:21:15,488 --> 00:21:17,417
He died in the war.

421
00:21:17,451 --> 00:21:19,419
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

422
00:21:19,507 --> 00:21:21,377
God, I'm so sorry.

423
00:21:21,402 --> 00:21:22,856
I had no idea.

424
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,410
Of course you didn't.

425
00:21:29,845 --> 00:21:31,886
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's...

Let's answer at the same time.

429
00:21:39,972 --> 00:21:41,241
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay.

430

431
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:44,629
- Dogs.
- Cats.

432
00:21:46,019 --> 00:21:48,254
- Okay. How about one more time?
- Sure.

433
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:51,121
- Um, pizza toppings.
- Okay.

434
00:21:51,146 --> 00:21:53,247
Mushrooms or pepperoni?

435
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:54,699
- Pepperoni.
- Mushrooms.

436
00:21:58,457 --> 00:21:59,826
Is that rain?

437
00:22:01,035 --> 00:22:02,041
I think it's raining.

438
00:22:02,066 --> 00:22:03,394
Yeah, I think it is raining.

439
00:22:03,769 --> 00:22:04,964
Oh, wow, look.

440
00:22:04,999 --> 00:22:06,838
That guy's already selling umbrellas.

441
00:22:06,863 --> 00:22:08,269
Should we go get one?

442
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:11,761
I-I don't think it's raining
that bad, right?

443
00:22:14,355 --> 00:22:18,033
Uh... uh, I guess not.

444
00:22:18,058 --> 00:22:19,913
I mean, if you want,
I can buy you an umbrella,

445
00:22:19,947 --> 00:22:23,636
but... I don't think
it's raining that hard is all.

446
00:22:24,925 --> 00:22:26,379
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

447
00:22:27,321 --> 00:22:28,769
- Okay.
- Yeah.

00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:32,965
BETH: Zoe, you could be
with any other guy.

- You're gonna be with Kevin?
- ZOE: Yes, I'm gonna be with Kevin.

- What in the holy hell are you thinking?
- What?

451
00:22:35,996 --> 00:22:37,263
- What am I thinking?
- Yes.

452
00:22:37,298 --> 00:22:38,729
I'm thinking he looks like Batman

453
00:22:38,754 --> 00:22:40,135
and he is built like a truck.

454
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,261
- Will you stop with the honesty?
- That's why.

455
00:22:42,613 --> 00:22:44,246
- Uncle Kevin?
- Yeah.

456
00:22:45,129 --> 00:22:46,673
Are you dating Zoe?

457
00:22:46,707 --> 00:22:49,108
ZOE: I think I can make
my own decisions on who I date.

458
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,394
- BETH: Okay, but Kevin?! Kevin?!
- ZOE: Yes, Kevin!

459
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:52,660
You know, we've been hanging out.

460
00:22:52,685 --> 00:22:54,129
We've been hanging out a lot, actually.

461
00:22:54,154 --> 00:22:55,715
You know, we don't, uh...

462
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:00,394
we don't talk about
anything real or intense.

463
00:23:00,824 --> 00:23:02,155
And for me, you know,
that's-that's sort of

464
00:23:02,189 --> 00:23:03,838
the barometer of dating, right?

465
00:23:03,863 --> 00:23:05,191
Then again, I did date
Jennifer Love Hewitt

466
00:23:05,226 --> 00:23:06,559
for the better part of a year,

467
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:08,494
and we talked about nothing intense.

468
00:23:08,529 --> 00:23:10,512
Do you know that he dated
the woman from <i>Party of Five?</i>

469
00:23:10,537 --> 00:23:11,804
Well, I love Neve Campbell.

Just between us gals?

Huh? Huh.

472
00:23:17,238 --> 00:23:21,674
I, uh... I was gonna invite her
to my premiere.

I was asking her to prom.

00:23:23,746 --> 00:23:26,246
You know what I mean? I thought
it'd be kind of, kind of cute.

475
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,680
What do you think? Do you
think she'd like that?

476
00:23:27,705 --> 00:23:28,716
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,394

sit where you eat, Zoe?!

478
00:23:30,636 --> 00:23:33,686
Well, I'm gonna go check that out. Okay?

00:23:33,894 --> 00:23:35,300
I'm gonna brave that one.

- I am not.

00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,925
But it's only because I really
want all of this to work out.

525
00:26:45,045 --> 00:26:47,980
I think you're
an exceptional person, Deja.

526
00:26:51,101 --> 00:26:52,840
I miss talking to you.

527
00:26:58,668 --> 00:27:00,960
I'm sorry I screwed up
your birthday, Randall.

528
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:03,043
No, it...

529
00:27:04,753 --> 00:27:06,105
You didn't... (SIGHS)

530
00:27:08,135 --> 00:27:10,336
You didn't screw up my birthday.

531
00:27:14,097 --> 00:27:15,675
It didn't go so great.

532
00:27:15,871 --> 00:27:17,082
Yeah?

533
00:27:17,871 --> 00:27:20,410
I was really hoping for a win today.

534
00:27:21,602 --> 00:27:22,925
I know.

535
00:27:26,653 --> 00:27:28,354
Zoe and Kevin are doing it.

536
00:27:28,824 --> 00:27:30,066
Yeah?

537
00:27:31,027 --> 00:27:32,707
I had to say something.

538
00:27:33,567 --> 00:27:34,769
I know.

539
00:27:36,199 --> 00:27:37,930
I don't know how you're gonna
make this right with Oprah,

540
00:27:37,965 --> 00:27:39,465
but I know.

541
00:27:40,136 --> 00:27:41,934
I made a donation to her foundation.

542
00:27:41,969 --> 00:27:43,308

You don't have to pretend like you do.
I really don't care.

546
00:28:35,821 --> 00:28:37,617
I just came here to say

547
00:28:38,906 --> 00:28:41,366
I'm gonna do something
really great with my life

548
00:28:41,391 --> 00:28:42,797
and you're gonna miss it.

549

And my mom's gonna miss it, too,
but that's okay

550
00:28:47,047 --> 00:28:48,609
'cause I met these people.

551
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,074
They think I'm exceptional.

552
00:28:53,062 --> 00:28:55,297
That's the word they use about me.

553
00:28:56,242 --> 00:28:58,219
And they actually want me.

554
00:28:58,539 --> 00:29:00,022
Like, they want me so bad

555
00:29:00,047 --> 00:29:03,695
that they plan out
weird conversations to tell me.

556
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:09,344
So... I came here to tell you that.

557
00:29:12,281 --> 00:29:15,750
Actually, I came here
to ask you for something.

558
00:29:16,015 --> 00:29:19,742
One thing and then you'll never
have to hear from me again.

559
00:29:35,719 --> 00:29:37,936
You sure you don't want
to play one of the games?

560
00:29:37,961 --> 00:29:39,154
Nah, I'm okay.

561
00:29:39,594 --> 00:29:40,922
Thank you.

562
00:29:42,367 --> 00:29:44,607
- I should probably get home.
- I mean, we could take a walk.

to meet you, Jack.

565
00:30:09,283 --> 00:30:12,094
Thank you for a nice night.

566
00:30:12,783 --> 00:30:14,492
I couldn't pay for the umbrella.

567
00:30:15,434 --> 00:30:16,820
I... (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

568
00:30:17,568 --> 00:30:19,648
I started the night with nine bucks.

569
00:30:20,734 --> 00:30:23,906
Five bucks to get in,
two bucks for a candy apple

570
00:30:23,931 --> 00:30:27,516
and a hot chocolate, which is
kind of a rip-off in my opinion,

571
00:30:27,541 --> 00:30:29,250
but that's neither here nor there.

572
00:30:29,275 --> 00:30:32,044
That left me with two dollars.

573
00:30:32,422 --> 00:30:34,290
And if I bought the umbrella,

574
00:30:34,315 --> 00:30:37,469
then I wouldn't have enough
for any of the games.

575
00:30:38,906 --> 00:30:41,828
I didn't know if you wanted
to play any games,

576
00:30:41,853 --> 00:30:43,101
but I couldn't take that chance

577
00:30:43,126 --> 00:30:45,266
because, well,
I-I-I brought you to a carnival,

578
00:30:45,291 --> 00:30:46,922
and you don't bring a girl to a carnival

579
00:30:46,947 --> 00:30:49,094
and-and not let her play any games.

580
00:30:58,054 --> 00:30:59,383
I've been having...

581
00:31:00,642 --> 00:31:03,266
a hard time since I got back.

582
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:09,461
Making money... finding my place.

583
00:31:15,107 --> 00:31:16,844
I don't like talking about the war.

584
00:31:18,869 --> 00:31:20,195
Or my brother.

585
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:23,070
It makes me sad.

586
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:27,406
It makes me... angry.

587
00:31:30,512 --> 00:31:31,937
But I like talking to you.

00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:34,734

00:31:41,244 --> 00:31:45,172
And I, and I never really
felt like that before.

a lousy first date.

00:38:45,674 --> 00:38:47,987
I've spoken to colleagues
who have had success

702
00:38:48,012 --> 00:38:49,745
with IVF at your weight.

703
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:54,331
Realistically, there's about
a 90% chance of failure here,

704
00:38:55,893 --> 00:38:58,729
but I'm choosing to look

705
00:38:58,754 --> 00:39:00,221
at the ten percent side today.

706
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,940
So, if you want to move forward,

707
00:39:03,965 --> 00:39:05,190
knowing that,

708
00:39:06,337 --> 00:39:08,206
I will take you on as a patient.

709
00:39:11,936 --> 00:39:14,404
- Really?
- Really.

710
00:39:16,034 --> 00:39:17,674
Really, really?

711
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:30,878
SPORTSCASTER (ON TV):
With just seconds left to play,

712
00:39:30,903 --> 00:39:32,995
Terry Bradshaw's pass was deflected.

713
00:39:33,276 --> 00:39:35,128
All seemed lost for Pittsburgh

714
00:39:35,153 --> 00:39:37,362
until, in a miraculous turn of events,

715
00:39:37,387 --> 00:39:39,155
the ball fell right into the hands

716
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:41,415
of star running back Franco Harris,

717
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,737
who ran it in for
the game-winning touchdown

718
00:39:43,762 --> 00:39:45,396
as time expired.

719
00:39:45,421 --> 00:39:47,222
CURT GOWDY (ON TV):
Franco Harris has it!

720
00:39:47,247 --> 00:39:49,548
And it's over! He grabbed it

721
00:39:49,573 --> 00:39:51,956
with five seconds to go and scored!

722
00:40:15,556 --> 00:40:17,156
Deja, are these expensive?

723
00:40:17,401 --> 00:40:19,503
- Like, how did you even...?
- I had a connection.

724
00:40:20,034 --> 00:40:21,479
It's no big deal.

725
00:40:22,798 --> 00:40:26,174
Oh, and you could sign
those papers if you want.

726
00:40:30,018 --> 00:40:31,963
GOWDY: <i>You talk
about Christmas miracles,</i>

727
00:40:32,049 --> 00:40:34,574
<i>here's the miracle of all miracles.</i>

728
00:40:34,608 --> 00:40:36,924
Franco, you remember now
the ball coming to you?

729
00:40:36,949 --> 00:40:39,120
I don't know, like, I seen it bounce off

730
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:41,924
and I just, you know, looked up

731
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,682
and I just put my hands out and...

732
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:47,862
Apparently, you're gonna have to

733
00:40:47,887 --> 00:40:49,755
shoot me up with hormones every day.

734
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,362
It's gonna be like
Requiem for a Dream up in here!

735
00:40:53,362 --> 00:40:54,776
That sounds good, hon.

736
00:41:00,107 --> 00:41:02,302
SPORTSCASTER: <i>It's just one
of those plays that'll go down</i>

737
00:41:02,327 --> 00:41:04,287
<i>in history, a single moment</i>

738
00:41:04,435 --> 00:41:07,273
<i>- that changed destiny forever.
- (TOILET FLUSHING)</i>

739
00:41:07,677 --> 00:41:09,341
It's time to go see her, Tess.

740
00:41:10,799 --> 00:41:12,365
I'm not ready.

741
00:41:15,146 --> 00:41:17,857
I'm just gonna run to the
restroom before we head over.

742
00:41:18,099 --> 00:41:19,385
I'll be right here.

743
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:25,497
(PHONE DIALING)

744
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,861
(PHONE RINGING)

745
00:41:31,832 --> 00:41:33,787
- Hey, Randall.
- RANDALL (ON PHONE): Hey.

746
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:35,404
You coming down?

747
00:41:38,091 --> 00:41:40,239
(SIGHS) Yeah, I don't know if I should.

748
00:41:40,274 --> 00:41:42,083
She wants you to be there, too.

749
00:41:43,146 --> 00:41:44,740
All right, I'll see you soon.

750
00:41:44,765 --> 00:41:46,638
RANDALL: All right, bye.

751
00:41:47,904 --> 00:41:50,826
SPORTSCASTER: <i>And while
there may be heartbreak</i>

752
00:41:50,851 --> 00:41:53,586
<i>tonight in Oakland, here in Pittsburgh,</i>

753
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:56,580
<i>they're calling it
the Immaculate Reception.</i>

754
00:41:56,605 --> 00:41:58,540
(LAUGHTER)

755
00:42:10,771 --> 00:42:12,605
(DOORBELL RINGS)

756
00:42:26,537 --> 00:42:28,216
SPORTSCASTER: <i>A reminder
for all of us, I think,</i>

757
00:42:28,306 --> 00:42:31,275
<i>that sometimes a ball
has to bounce off one person</i>

758
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:34,622
<i>a few times to wind up
in the hands of the right guy</i>

759
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:38,140
<i>and make a story truly immortal.</i>
