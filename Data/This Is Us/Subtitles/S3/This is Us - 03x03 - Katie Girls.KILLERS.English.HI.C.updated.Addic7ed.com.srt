to move to London with you

165
00:08:51,014 --> 00:08:52,593

00:09:21,965 --> 00:09:23,138
I-I, um...

181
00:09:23,566 --> 00:09:24,833
Don't go to L.A.

182
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,380
New York has a great music scene.

183
00:09:27,911 --> 00:09:29,598
And it's got soul, and...

184
00:09:29,841 --> 00:09:31,341
I would go with you.

185
00:09:31,692 --> 00:09:33,042
Listen, I-I've got this friend

186
00:09:33,044 --> 00:09:34,809
who's got an in at the Village Voice.

187
00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:38,700
I could write during the day
and see you sing at night.

188
00:09:40,091 --> 00:09:41,817
We could both follow our dreams.

189
00:09:41,819 --> 00:09:43,059
(REBECCA LAUGHS)

190
00:09:46,684 --> 00:09:48,257
- After you.
- Thank you.

191
00:09:48,259 --> 00:09:49,856
You're welcome. See?

192
00:09:50,261 --> 00:09:53,128
I'd say being picked up
from the airport isn't so bad.

193
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,197
You get some guy
to carry your bags for you,

194
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,649
buy you baller flowers.

195
00:09:56,927 --> 00:09:58,200
"Baller"?

196
00:09:58,202 --> 00:09:59,730
I regretted it
the moment that I said it.

197
00:09:59,755 --> 00:10:01,363
Ooh, a shopping spree.

198
00:10:01,388 --> 00:10:02,872
Uh, ye... No. That's, you know...

199
00:10:02,874 --> 00:10:04,457
Those are talk show outfits, actually.

200
00:10:04,482 --> 00:10:05,833
Yeah, it's been a pretty intense week

201
00:10:05,858 --> 00:10:07,826
ever since the premiere, so I had to...

202
00:10:07,851 --> 00:10:09,084
- Right.
- Actually, you know what, um,

203
00:10:09,086 --> 00:10:10,317
I have my last interview

204
00:10:10,342 --> 00:10:12,747
tomorrow morning; if you want to tag
along, you're more than welcome.

205
00:10:12,772 --> 00:10:14,098
- It could be fun.
- Uh...

206
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:17,348
I don't know that vapid movie
press is really my thing.

207
00:10:18,067 --> 00:10:20,434
Right. No, it's fine.

208
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:21,778
I mean, I'm sure it'll be boring anyway.

209
00:10:21,803 --> 00:10:23,872
It's with some NPR guy
named Terry Gross.

210
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:28,364
Terry Gross is not a man, Kevin.

211
00:10:28,591 --> 00:10:30,138
She is a goddess.

212
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,895
Really? You know him? Her?

213
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,391
- Yeah.
- Okay, well,

214
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:34,883
invitation's open. I mean,

215
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:36,286
you could tag along if you wanted to.

216
00:10:36,311 --> 00:10:37,963
I know how much you hate
vapid movie press and all...

217
00:10:37,988 --> 00:10:39,654
- I'm coming.
- You're coming.

218
00:10:39,937 --> 00:10:41,263
- Mm.
- Yeah.

219
00:10:42,186 --> 00:10:43,559
(LINE RINGING)

220
00:10:43,584 --> 00:10:44,778
BROWN: Hello?

221
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:48,697
Councilman Brown.
Uh, it's Randall Pearson.

222
00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:50,332
You're a difficult man to get ahold of.

223
00:10:50,334 --> 00:10:52,130
Comes with the job, I'm afraid.

224
00:10:52,158 --> 00:10:53,622
I'm never at my desk.

225
00:10:54,162 --> 00:10:56,302
Guess it's a little different
than weather trading.

226
00:10:56,817 --> 00:10:58,113
Oh, you looked me up.

227
00:10:58,138 --> 00:10:59,557
I always take an interest in people

228
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:01,042
who take an interest in me.

229
00:11:01,153 --> 00:11:02,977
I'd rather you take an interest

230
00:11:02,979 --> 00:11:04,684
in the rec center on 5th Street.

231
00:11:04,934 --> 00:11:07,115
You promised to send a
maintenance crew seven days ago.

232
00:11:07,325 --> 00:11:09,419
And to fix all the busted street lights.

233
00:11:09,505 --> 00:11:11,519
There are a whole lot of people
who are depending on you, sir.

234
00:11:11,848 --> 00:11:13,621
BROWN: I hear that, and I promise you,

235
00:11:13,646 --> 00:11:14,856
I will get to your street lights,

236
00:11:14,881 --> 00:11:16,848
but there's an order
to the way I do things.

237
00:11:17,016 --> 00:11:19,598
Now, I'm sorry. I've got another call.

238
00:11:19,755 --> 00:11:21,177
- Council...
- (PHONE BEEPS)

239
00:11:23,234 --> 00:11:24,246
(SIGHS)

240
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,325
Looks like we're both
in a holding pattern.

241
00:11:26,366 --> 00:11:27,401
(CHUCKLES)

242
00:11:27,426 --> 00:11:29,276
I am hoping tomorrow is the day

243
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:31,578
that Bill finally signs off
on my proposal.

244
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,552
He will. Hey.

245
00:11:34,888 --> 00:11:36,442
Who wouldn't sign off on you?

246
00:11:37,294 --> 00:11:39,152
I'll sign off on you right now.

247
00:11:39,154 --> 00:11:40,034
(LAUGHS)

248
00:11:40,059 --> 00:11:41,288
That don't even make sense.

249
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:43,106
It will if you let me demonstrate.

250
00:11:43,876 --> 00:11:46,910
- Mm. Ah.
- You talk to your sister yet?

251
00:11:47,544 --> 00:11:48,968
I texted her this afternoon.

252
00:11:48,993 --> 00:11:50,442
She has yet to respond.

253
00:11:50,568 --> 00:11:52,122
Was your text an apology?

254
00:11:52,271 --> 00:11:53,356
Sort of.

255
00:11:53,381 --> 00:11:54,583
- Randall.
- Hmm?

256
00:11:54,608 --> 00:11:57,392
She is having surgery tomorrow, okay?

257
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,583
I love you, boo, but you overstepped.

258
00:11:59,911 --> 00:12:02,614
And you kind of have trouble
apologizing to your siblings.

259
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,989
What? No, I don't.

260
00:12:04,065 --> 00:12:05,169
Mm-hmm.

261
00:12:05,341 --> 00:12:06,763
Miguel says it's because you feel

262
00:12:06,788 --> 00:12:08,177
like you need to be the rock for them,

263
00:12:08,202 --> 00:12:10,200
and apologizing shows vulnerability.

264
00:12:10,225 --> 00:12:12,348
I'm sorry, uh, Miguel's
weighing in on this now?

265
00:12:12,373 --> 00:12:13,911
Me, him and Toby have a text chain.

266
00:12:13,936 --> 00:12:15,622
It's mostly gifs, but, you know,

267
00:12:15,647 --> 00:12:17,446
sometimes we talk about how
messed up y'all are.

268

(SQUAWKS)

269
00:12:18,755 --> 00:12:20,466
- What are you doing?
- Hi, Kate.

270
00:12:21,346 --> 00:12:22,778
Yeah. I have Randall for you.

271
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:23,989
- Hold on.
- (EXHALES)

272
00:12:27,763 --> 00:12:28,950
RANDALL (ON PHONE): Hi, Kate.

273
00:12:29,114 --> 00:12:31,181
Um, it's Randall.

274
00:12:32,731 --> 00:12:34,395
Look, I just wanted to, uh,

275
00:12:35,009 --> 00:12:37,286
wish you luck
with your surgery tomorrow.

276
00:12:38,705 --> 00:12:39,778
That's it?

277
00:12:40,013 --> 00:12:41,528
No, it's not. I...

278
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,645
I also wanted to talk about
our conversation last week.

279
00:12:44,684 --> 00:12:46,167
- Oh, hold on a sec.
- (KNOCKING AT DOOR)

280
00:12:46,192 --> 00:12:47,395
- TOBY: I got it.
- (AUDIO BARKS)

281
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,114
- Oh, okay.
- I got it. I got it.

282
00:12:52,849 --> 00:12:54,872
- From Kevin.
- Are you kidding me?

283
00:12:55,044 --> 00:12:57,263
RANDALL: Hey, look, Kate,
I feel like last week, I...

284
00:12:57,864 --> 00:12:58,956
At Kevin's premiere,

285
00:12:58,981 --> 00:13:03,058
some regrettable utterances
were... uttered.

286
00:13:03,552 --> 00:13:04,786
- Look, what I'm...
- You know what, uh, Randall,

287
00:13:04,811 --> 00:13:05,988
I can't have a thing with you right now.

288
00:13:06,013 --> 00:13:08,394
Mom is acting like I'm having
a triple bypass.

289
00:13:08,419 --> 00:13:10,331
And then Kevin just sent me
flowers that you send to someone

290
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:12,300
when you're worried that they're
never gonna see a flower again.

291
00:13:12,622 --> 00:13:15,097
Everyone in this family
is making me feel like

292
00:13:15,122 --> 00:13:16,661
I'm gonna die tomorrow.

293
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,348
It's really starting to freak me out.

294
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,909
So, um, thank you for the call,

295
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:23,630
- but I'm gonna go.
- No, just wait, Kate, hey.

296
00:13:23,655 --> 00:13:25,075
- I...
- (PHONE BEEPS)

297
00:13:28,528 --> 00:13:29,638
Oh, wow.

298
00:13:30,262 --> 00:13:32,317
- She sounds really scared.
- I know.

299
00:13:33,576 --> 00:13:35,162
But one of the other things
that Miguel says

300
00:13:35,164 --> 00:13:36,663
that you do with your brother and sister

301
00:13:36,665 --> 00:13:38,298
is overreact when... What are you doing?

302
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,599
I'm gonna get my suitcase.

303
00:13:39,601 --> 00:13:41,334
I'm gonna fly to L.A. for the surgery.

304
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:44,046
Oh, my God, Miguel is so on point.

305
00:13:54,544 --> 00:13:56,614
I promised myself I wouldn't ask you

306
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,809
to move to New York for at least a week.

307
00:13:58,881 --> 00:14:01,364
Mm. You really blew it, huh?

308
00:14:01,409 --> 00:14:02,692
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

309
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:06,091
I do want to get out of Pittsburgh.

310
00:14:08,066 --> 00:14:10,669
And, like you said,
New York does have soul.

311
00:14:11,586 --> 00:14:14,497
So... is that a yes?

312
00:14:15,533 --> 00:14:16,716
(LAUGHS)

313
00:14:19,042 --> 00:14:20,161
REBECCA: Mm.

314
00:14:20,677 --> 00:14:21,646
(LAUGHS)

315
00:14:21,671 --> 00:14:22,973
- We should celebrate.
- Yes.

316
00:14:22,998 --> 00:14:24,270
- Let's make a toast...
- Yes.

317
00:14:25,192 --> 00:14:26,903
...with... grapefruit juice.

318
00:14:26,928 --> 00:14:28,255
I'll go get us something.

319
00:14:28,348 --> 00:14:30,794
- I'll come.
- No, no. I-I could use the walk.

320
00:14:30,942 --> 00:14:32,380
And you should stay with your family.

321
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:33,786
I will surprise you, okay?

322
00:14:33,811 --> 00:14:35,013
I'll be right back.

323
00:14:38,572 --> 00:14:39,755
Hi, Kate.

324
00:14:39,817 --> 00:14:41,770
- How are you feeling today?
- Little nervous.

325
00:14:41,795 --> 00:14:44,760
Just try and relax.
Your vitals looks great.

326
00:14:44,762 --> 00:14:46,888
The nurse will bring you in
in just a couple of minutes.

327
00:14:46,913 --> 00:14:48,606
While you're in surgery,
Toby will give us

328
00:14:48,631 --> 00:14:50,376
a sperm sample, and then we'll put

329
00:14:50,401 --> 00:14:52,433
your eggs and your sperm together,

330
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,161
and, hopefully, make some embryos.

331
00:14:54,266 --> 00:14:55,708
- Okay?
- Okay.

332
00:14:56,106 --> 00:14:57,306
Thank you, Dr. Jasper.

333
00:14:57,481 --> 00:14:58,747
I'll see you in there.

334
00:15:00,497 --> 00:15:03,011
- Tobe, I'm freaking out.
- What?

335
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:04,746
God, what if I die in there?

336
00:15:04,748 --> 00:15:06,667
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you're not gonna die.

337
00:15:06,692 --> 00:15:10,591
Okay, well, if I do,
I want you to find someone.

338
00:15:10,763 --> 00:15:13,333
But not that bitch from your
accounting department, Sharyn.

339
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,239
She always gives me the stink eye.

340
00:15:15,294 --> 00:15:18,630
- And not Madison.
- Okay. Promise I won't marry Madison.

341
00:15:18,655 --> 00:15:20,208
I'm not gonna marry stink-eye Sharyn.

342
00:15:20,233 --> 00:15:21,666
I will just find myself a committed,

343
00:15:21,691 --> 00:15:22,872
semi-happy relationship

344
00:15:22,897 --> 00:15:24,434
with someone less cool than you, okay?

345
00:15:24,459 --> 00:15:25,770
- Okay.
- Deal.

346
00:15:26,276 --> 00:15:27,592
We're gonna bring you in now.

347
00:15:27,617 --> 00:15:29,614
- Okay. Oh, okay.
- Okay. Okay.

348
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:31,184
- I love you.
- I love you.

349
00:15:31,978 --> 00:15:33,575
- Okay. Bye.
- Off you go.

350
00:15:34,331 --> 00:15:36,059
Okay, you're gonna do great.

351
00:15:41,677 --> 00:15:42,895
KEVIN: Toby says that, uh,

352
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,286
Kate's going into pre-op right now.

00:35:43,734 --> 00:35:46,818
and I held on to him
because that was rare...

706
00:35:47,989 --> 00:35:49,771
and it still is rare.

707
00:35:53,865 --> 00:35:55,886
I mean, I've known since I was 16

708
00:35:55,888 --> 00:35:59,160
that I didn't want to be
somebody whose entire day

709
00:35:59,185 --> 00:36:01,158
revolved around waiting
for their husband

710
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,520
to get home from work.

711
00:36:02,545 --> 00:36:05,062
And I know that Alan would
never make me be that person.

712
00:36:05,087 --> 00:36:06,334
No, he wouldn't.

713
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,920
But there's someone else.

714
00:36:15,091 --> 00:36:17,608
And I know next to nothing about him.

715
00:36:18,255 --> 00:36:19,510
He was in Vietnam.

716
00:36:20,412 --> 00:36:24,074
Uh, his home life
seems really messy and sad.

717
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:26,630
His dreams are nothing like mine.

718
00:36:27,388 --> 00:36:30,293
I think that he would be good
to me and support me,

719
00:36:30,318 --> 00:36:32,076
but I have no way of knowing for sure

720
00:36:32,101 --> 00:36:33,550
because I don't even really know him.

721
00:36:33,575 --> 00:36:35,974
We've spent all of four hours together.

722
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:38,748
But...

723
00:36:40,505 --> 00:36:41,677
You have a feeling.

724
00:36:41,702 --> 00:36:43,404
I have a feeling.

725
00:36:47,295 --> 00:36:49,228
- (MONITORS BEEP)
- (MAN SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY OVER P.A.)

726
00:36:58,927 --> 00:37:00,089
How is she?

727
00:37:00,662 --> 00:37:02,504
She's bruised up real bad.

728
00:37:02,529 --> 00:37:05,380
They broke her arm, but she'll be okay.

729
00:37:06,646 --> 00:37:07,821
I knew this would happen.

730
00:37:08,154 --> 00:37:10,266
I told that girl time and time again,

731
00:37:10,291 --> 00:37:12,310
"I don't want you walking
these streets alone.

732
00:37:12,335 --> 00:37:14,926
"And if anyone ever tries
to take your bag or your money

733
00:37:14,928 --> 00:37:16,490
or whatever, just give it to them."

734
00:37:17,298 --> 00:37:19,130
But she loves that damn phone.

735
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:23,452
I'm gonna do something about this.

736
00:37:24,255 --> 00:37:25,320
(SUCKS TEETH)

737
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:27,068
Everybody talks,

738
00:37:27,388 --> 00:37:29,076
but they don't actually do anything.

739
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,896
I'm not like everyone else.

740
00:37:32,287 --> 00:37:33,474
Good.

741
00:37:34,007 --> 00:37:35,341
Then do something.

742
00:37:48,357 --> 00:37:49,560
How is she?

743
00:37:50,045 --> 00:37:53,686
- Uh, broken arm.
- Mm.

744
00:37:53,711 --> 00:37:55,111
She's bruised up.

745
00:37:57,154 --> 00:37:58,505
What a day.

746
00:37:59,773 --> 00:38:00,974
Yeah.

747
00:38:10,771 --> 00:38:13,177
- Randall...
- These people need someone, Beth.

748
00:38:15,553 --> 00:38:17,412
My dad was a superhero.

749
00:38:18,472 --> 00:38:20,982
Man literally saved my life
the day I was born.

750
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,677
And he always took action.

751
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:25,740
He never sat still.

752
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:32,576
He was a superhero and then he died

753
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:35,831
and we've all been
scrambling ever since...

754
00:38:37,556 --> 00:38:39,889
...scrambling to keep him alive
however we can...

755
00:38:43,576 --> 00:38:46,693
...scrambling for new ways
to feel close to him.

756
00:39:03,927 --> 00:39:06,318
I pride myself on having
a piece of my dad in me,

757
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,220
always have.

758
00:39:08,451 --> 00:39:10,355
But my dad wouldn't have sat still.

759
00:39:11,357 --> 00:39:13,976
And my dad wouldn't have
just made phone calls.

760
00:39:14,357 --> 00:39:17,013
If this councilman won't do
his job, then maybe I can.

(SIGHS)

762
00:39:20,978 --> 00:39:23,255
I think I'm gonna run against him, Beth.

763
00:39:28,946 --> 00:39:30,795
