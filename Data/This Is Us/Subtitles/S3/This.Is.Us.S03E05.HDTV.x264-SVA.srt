For the last decade,

383
00:16:17,422 --> 00:16:20,531
I've been living in Alpine,
New Jersey, raising a family.

384
00:16:21,157 --> 00:16:24,890
But my father William lived six
blocks from here for 20 years.

385
00:16:25,607 --> 00:16:27,593
And he cared for the people
in his building.

386
00:16:27,671 --> 00:16:29,351
He fought for their quality of life

387
00:16:29,376 --> 00:16:31,601
by speaking up to management, often.

my wife Beth and I... hey, wife...

we decided to take up his mantle,

395
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:49,250
and we bought the building
and I became a landlord.

396
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:51,820
And I fixed what was
broken as fast as I could.

397
00:16:52,312 --> 00:16:55,589
And then I saw the neighborhood:
the broken streetlights,

398
00:16:55,591 --> 00:16:58,842
the rising crime, and I decided
I wanted to fix that, too.

517
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,859
And he's the first pure alabaster one

518
00:23:28,884 --> 00:23:30,434
I've dated seriously,

519
00:23:30,459 --> 00:23:32,664
- so... Yeah.
- Ah.

520
00:23:33,984 --> 00:23:35,593
Today at the gas station,

521
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:38,414
the cashier didn't realize
we were together,

522
00:23:39,215 --> 00:23:41,851
and, um, she was rude to me.

523
00:23:42,906 --> 00:23:44,898
Not in the obvious way, just, uh...

524
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:47,414
- I got it.
- Mm, and, Kevin, he was...

525
00:23:48,632 --> 00:23:50,953
- He didn't get it?
- He didn't even see it.

526
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:54,867
And it's the little things,
you know, like, this morning,

527
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:56,218
I forgot my pillowcase

528
00:23:56,984 --> 00:24:00,046
and I realized he thinks I sleep
with a special pillowcase

529
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:01,304
because I'm fancy.

530
00:24:01,682 --> 00:24:03,298
(LAUGHING): Oh, Lord.

531
00:24:03,808 --> 00:24:05,691
- Did you explain it to him?
- No.

532
00:24:05,716 --> 00:24:07,984
When I start explaining
that I need a silk pillowcase

533
00:24:08,009 --> 00:24:09,945
for my hair, then where does it end?

534
00:24:10,719 --> 00:24:12,445
There's always gonna
be something, right?

535
00:24:13,179 --> 00:24:14,625
And do I really want to spend my time

536
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:16,398
trying to explain
what it's like to be black

537
00:24:16,423 --> 00:24:18,906
to a white movie star?

538
00:24:19,199 --> 00:24:20,698
Sounds exhausting.

539
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,125
Little bit.

540
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,859
Well, it seems to me,

541
00:24:27,377 --> 00:24:29,750
you need to decide what you can handle.

542
00:24:30,463 --> 00:24:32,273
And if he's worth it to you.

543
00:24:34,132 --> 00:24:35,320
Hm.

544
00:24:36,209 --> 00:24:38,257
Let's get to this key lime pie.

545
00:24:38,438 --> 00:24:39,718
(BOTH LAUGH)

546
00:24:44,356 --> 00:24:47,434
Well, that was an unmitigated disaster.

547
00:24:47,628 --> 00:24:49,724
Five people stayed behind
to talk to you.

548
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:52,020
They work here, Beth.

549
00:24:52,552 --> 00:24:54,341
- Oh.
- I don't get it, babe.

550
00:24:54,442 --> 00:24:56,450
Every day I hear a new complaint

551
00:24:56,475 --> 00:24:58,508
about quality of life in this district,

552
00:24:58,533 --> 00:25:01,451
and in the next breath they say,
"I'm voting for Sol Brown."

553
00:25:01,713 --> 00:25:03,045
What's that supposed to tell me?

554
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,450
ALBERT: Go back where you belong.

555
00:25:04,552 --> 00:25:05,747
What's that, now?

556
00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:08,802
- I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.
- BETH: Hey, babe.

557
00:25:08,997 --> 00:25:10,520
I said go back where you belong.

558
00:25:11,044 --> 00:25:13,286
Hmm. Where I belong, huh?

559
00:25:16,335 --> 00:25:18,161
And where exactly is that, Mr. Jones?

560
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:20,606
Oh, please, you tell me

561
00:25:21,066 --> 00:25:23,731
because you would be answering
the great mystery of my life,

562
00:25:23,756 --> 00:25:24,880
I tell you that.

563
00:25:27,208 --> 00:25:28,661
Look, all due respect, sir,

564
00:25:28,677 --> 00:25:30,344
this is a community of good people

565
00:25:30,346 --> 00:25:31,934
who have been totally abandoned,

566
00:25:31,959 --> 00:25:33,992
and I can't fathom why
they're not furious about it.

567
00:25:34,179 --> 00:25:36,847
Because they know the man
who's failing them?

568
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:39,903
When did complacency
become the best option here?

569
00:25:40,208 --> 00:25:42,138
Blind loyalty the better way?

570
00:25:42,739 --> 00:25:44,372
Man, get the hell on
out of my restaurant.

571
00:25:44,397 --> 00:25:45,731
DORIS: Albert, come on, now.

572
00:25:45,756 --> 00:25:47,255
Who do you think you are,
coming down here

573
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,216
and wagging your finger in our faces?

574
00:25:50,411 --> 00:25:51,638
In 2003,

575
00:25:51,755 --> 00:25:54,535
after owning this place for 21 years,

576
00:25:54,537 --> 00:25:56,153
working our fingers to the bone,

577
00:25:56,705 --> 00:25:59,957
new landlord comes strolling up
in here with his white collar

578
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:03,099
and his white agenda
to move black folks out.

579
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:07,196
He raises the rent by a half,
and just like that we were done.

580
00:26:08,137 --> 00:26:10,528
Doris sat down on the floor right there

581
00:26:10,553 --> 00:26:12,802
where you're standing, and she sobbed.

582
00:26:13,628 --> 00:26:15,481
New councilman heard our story,

583
00:26:15,506 --> 00:26:18,513
a skinny young cat named Sol Brown.

584
00:26:19,162 --> 00:26:21,911
He took the landlord to a Phillies game.

585
00:26:22,815 --> 00:26:25,114
Something was decided, I don't
know what, and I don't...

586
00:26:25,618 --> 00:26:28,652
I don't much care, 'cause the next day

587
00:26:28,654 --> 00:26:30,536
the landlord came back up in here,

588
00:26:30,716 --> 00:26:32,630
raised the rent a reasonable rate,

589
00:26:32,825 --> 00:26:35,659
sat down, we broke bread together,

590
00:26:35,661 --> 00:26:37,528
and 15 years later, we still here.

591
00:26:38,928 --> 00:26:40,153
(WHISPERING): So, no.

592
00:26:40,731 --> 00:26:43,208
We don't owe Sol Brown our loyalty.

593
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,575
We owe him our lives.

594
00:26:53,163 --> 00:26:54,317
Am I clear?

595
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:58,145
Yes, sir.

596
00:26:59,974 --> 00:27:00,981
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

597
00:27:01,095 --> 00:27:02,153
MARY: Toby?

598
00:27:06,528 --> 00:27:11,434
Sweetie, uh, your brother
is-is really worried about you.

599
00:27:13,067 --> 00:27:15,308
He-he said that you talked on the phone

600
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:17,583
and that you said
some pretty scary things.

601
00:27:17,857 --> 00:27:19,458
Have you been outside at all?

602
00:27:24,669 --> 00:27:26,676
Toby, Josie's been gone for months.

603
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:30,513
- Y-You really need to get up.
- I can't.

604
00:27:31,403 --> 00:27:34,075
Yes, you can. I did.

605
00:27:34,794 --> 00:27:38,153
With the help of a ten-year-old
boy who did impressions.

606
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,958
Listen to me, the joy in you

607
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:48,081
is as much a part of you
as this sadness.

608
00:27:48,817 --> 00:27:50,122
Do you hear me?

609
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:53,036
I do think the medication

610
00:27:53,061 --> 00:27:55,075
and our sessions
are having an effect, Toby.

611
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,044
I concur, Doc Feelgood.

612
00:27:57,552 --> 00:27:59,625
Now, if we could only find
somebody who wanted to date

613
00:27:59,627 --> 00:28:01,895
a guy who looks like
he swallowed the Unabomber.

614
00:28:02,895 --> 00:28:05,153
Is that something
that you'd like to attack?

615
00:28:08,903 --> 00:28:10,436
WOMAN: And so I said to myself,

616
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:12,083
"Tanya, you have lost the weight,

617
00:28:12,108 --> 00:28:14,536
"and now you can help others

618
00:28:14,714 --> 00:28:16,528
be skinny like you."

619
00:28:17,239 --> 00:28:19,372
Oh, thank you, guys. Thank you.

620
00:28:20,482 --> 00:28:22,380
So, who would like to share first?

621
00:28:23,708 --> 00:28:24,984
Come on. Come on, come on, come on.

622
00:28:25,395 --> 00:28:27,653
WOMAN: Seriously, man? You've been
hogging this for an hour.

623
00:28:27,655 --> 00:28:30,156
What are you even talking about?
What time is it?

624
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:31,559
3:45.

625
00:28:33,216 --> 00:28:35,763
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

626
00:28:37,575 --> 00:28:38,974
KEVIN: So, you're saying
my old man was in charge

627
00:28:38,999 --> 00:28:40,114
- of all these guys?
- ROBINSON: Yep.

628
00:28:40,139 --> 00:28:42,013
- And they all loved him.
- All right.

629
00:28:42,038 --> 00:28:43,958
- That sounds about right.
- (CHUCKLES)

630
00:28:44,388 --> 00:28:45,755
Man. You know, I always knew

631
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:47,423
there was more to his story
than he let on.

632
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:50,092
You know? Even as a kid,
like, I would ask him questions

633
00:28:50,094 --> 00:28:53,739
or a war movie would come on,
you know, and, um...

634
00:28:54,302 --> 00:28:57,138
I don't know,
something would come over him,

635
00:28:57,163 --> 00:28:58,591
you know, l-like, uh...

636
00:28:59,653 --> 00:29:01,187
like, as if he was haunted.

637
00:29:02,466 --> 00:29:05,309
Well, he wasn't haunted
when I got pulled out.

638
00:29:06,888 --> 00:29:08,864
I, uh, tried writing him.

639
00:29:09,113 --> 00:29:10,794
- Never heard back.
- Hmm.

640
00:29:11,391 --> 00:29:14,859
And then, you know, time.

641
00:29:16,099 --> 00:29:17,684
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

642
00:29:19,231 --> 00:29:20,790
And, uh, these guys here,

643
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:22,505
you know, might they know something?

644
00:29:23,833 --> 00:29:26,153
Uh, him there, that's-that's Townie.

645
00:29:26,513 --> 00:29:29,682
I heard he passed from cancer
about, uh, ten years ago.

646
00:29:29,856 --> 00:29:32,700
And that's Murphy. Died in-country.

647
00:29:32,725 --> 00:29:35,466
And, uh, that man, I don't know him.

648
00:29:35,652 --> 00:29:36,864
- No?
- No.

649
00:29:38,169 --> 00:29:39,972
It says "Pearson" on this guy's shirt.

650
00:29:39,997 --> 00:29:42,333
I'm pretty sure that's my uncle
that died in the war.

651
00:29:42,358 --> 00:29:44,642
- Hmm.
- My dad never talked about him much,

652
00:29:44,667 --> 00:29:47,474
uh, so... You ever cross paths with him?

653
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:49,036
No, no.

654
00:29:51,481 --> 00:29:55,138
Look, son, I-I know you come a long way,

655
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:58,302
and I'm sorry I don't have
the answers you're looking for.

656
00:29:59,458 --> 00:30:03,216
But in my experience
with this particular war,

657
00:30:03,903 --> 00:30:06,192
sometimes the answers are so dark

658
00:30:07,407 --> 00:30:09,138
you're better off not having them.

659
00:30:20,942 --> 00:30:23,519
- What are you doing here?
- Fixing your fridge.

660
00:30:23,661 --> 00:30:26,083
I'm almost done. Hey, Randall.

661
00:30:26,778 --> 00:30:29,575
Why are you home so early?
Prom that boring?

662
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:31,091
Never made it there.

663
00:30:31,958 --> 00:30:33,684
Her dad freaked out when he saw me.

664
00:30:34,118 --> 00:30:35,591
- So...
- (SIGHS)

665
00:30:39,552 --> 00:30:40,950
You know I was born in Puerto Rico?

666
00:30:42,434 --> 00:30:44,872
I, uh, came here to Pittsburgh
when I was eight years old.

667
00:30:46,325 --> 00:30:48,731
And I was determined

668
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,145
to not have an accent

669
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:53,341
'cause I was gonna be starting
at a new school.

670
00:30:53,786 --> 00:30:57,303
So I studied every American TV show.

671
00:30:57,305 --> 00:31:00,556
I repeated every line from every
commercial all summer long.

672
00:31:01,145 --> 00:31:03,442
And the second...

673
00:31:04,184 --> 00:31:05,561
I walked into class on the first day,

674
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:07,730
before I could even say a word,

675
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:10,724
those kids, they gave me a nickname:

676
00:31:11,731 --> 00:31:14,474
Ricky Ricardo. Who's Cuban.

677
00:31:16,403 --> 00:31:18,325
- You know what I did?
- What?

678
00:31:19,841 --> 00:31:21,494
I started entering every room

679
00:31:21,496 --> 00:31:24,246
saying, "Lucy, I'm home."

680
00:31:27,099 --> 00:31:29,752
But you are stronger than I was.

681
00:31:29,864 --> 00:31:32,091
- Even at that age, Randall.
- Thanks.

682
00:31:32,886 --> 00:31:35,153
But I'm-I'm tired,
so I'm gonna go to bed.

683
00:31:41,356 --> 00:31:43,425
I-I feel like my brain's
gonna explode, you know?

684
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:44,850
I feel like I learned a lot today,

685
00:31:44,852 --> 00:31:46,852
but at the same time, I feel
like I didn't learn anything.

686
00:31:46,854 --> 00:31:47,937
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

687
00:31:48,349 --> 00:31:50,278
You order room service?

688
00:31:51,239 --> 00:31:53,326
Uh, delivery for Kevin Pearson?

689
00:31:53,895 --> 00:31:55,099
Oh, that's for you.

690
00:31:56,075 --> 00:31:57,913
- Oh.
- I got the best one I could find.

691
00:32:00,692 --> 00:32:03,452
You got me a pillowcase?

692
00:32:03,477 --> 00:32:05,644
Yeah. It seemed really important
to you, so...

695
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,450
Yeah.

696
00:32:13,396 --> 00:32:16,628
The reason I need the silk pillowcase

697
00:32:16,653 --> 00:32:18,801
is because it keeps my hair from drying.

698
00:32:20,169 --> 00:32:22,849
And today, at the gas station,

699
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:24,872
the clerk was racist.

700
00:32:26,536 --> 00:32:27,995
You're kidding me.
What'd she say to you?

701
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:31,864
She didn't say anything, but she
assumed we weren't together.

702
00:32:32,263 --> 00:32:34,734
And she was sharp with me
because she was bothered

703
00:32:34,736 --> 00:32:37,403
by a black person invading
a white person's space.

704
00:32:39,948 --> 00:32:41,552
Why are you just now telling me this?

705
00:32:44,872 --> 00:32:48,722
Because I think, God help me,

706
00:32:48,747 --> 00:32:51,005
I think you just might be worth it.

REBECCA: You know,
when I was three years old,

709
00:33:06,708 --> 00:33:10,569
my mom sang me this lullaby, and
once was all I needed to hear it

710
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:12,122
before I could sing it back.

711
00:33:13,601 --> 00:33:15,935
Music was always in me.

712
00:33:18,286 --> 00:33:22,044
And I put it aside lots of times.

713
00:33:23,489 --> 00:33:27,075
Out of fear and sadness,

714
00:33:28,274 --> 00:33:29,981
and lots of reasons.

715
00:33:33,792 --> 00:33:37,377
It's funny. When Miguel
brought the piano here today,

716
00:33:37,402 --> 00:33:39,652
you said it made the room
look a lot smaller.

717
00:33:39,677 --> 00:33:43,429
And to me, it felt so much bigger.

718
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:45,971
'Cause music has always represented

719
00:33:45,973 --> 00:33:50,392
this huge, empty room
that I could just walk right in

720
00:33:50,394 --> 00:33:52,763
