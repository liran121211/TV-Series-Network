I got you this. I can't read
the label, but, um,

532
00:34:20,074 --> 00:34:22,357
it's either coconut water
or suntan lotion.

533
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:24,049
I'd give it a little sniff

534
00:34:24,074 --> 00:34:25,675
before I drank it, if I were you.

535
00:34:28,935 --> 00:34:30,792
- Want me to help you with that?
- No, I-I can do it.

536
00:34:31,063 --> 00:34:32,411
No, you can't.

537
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,034
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

538
00:34:43,736 --> 00:34:44,883
(SIGHS)

539
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:46,855
Coconut water?

540
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,405
- Suntan lotion.
- Ah.

541
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,603
You know, my dad, um...

542
00:34:54,829 --> 00:34:58,094
he kept the first 28 years of
his life a secret from my mom,

543
00:34:58,119 --> 00:35:00,890
which worked for them, you know.

544
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,975
I mean, it more than worked
for them, actually, but...

545
00:35:07,223 --> 00:35:09,085
I don't want that for us.

546
00:35:10,871 --> 00:35:12,845
Okay? I don't.

547
00:35:12,879 --> 00:35:15,756
I-I want to be able to tell you
everything and I want to know...

548
00:35:17,188 --> 00:35:18,693
I want to know everything
about you. (CHUCKLES)

549
00:35:23,437 --> 00:35:25,136
But if I can't,

550
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,117
um,

551
00:35:30,049 --> 00:35:31,168
it's okay.

552
00:35:33,147 --> 00:35:34,170
That's okay

553
00:35:34,195 --> 00:35:37,603
because you smell like peaches,

554
00:35:38,088 --> 00:35:39,643
and, well, right now you-you don't.

555
00:35:39,668 --> 00:35:41,701
You smell like garbage
right now, actually,

556
00:35:41,726 --> 00:35:43,729
but, typically, you smell like peaches.

557
00:35:43,754 --> 00:35:46,289
And you keep snacks in that
big purse that you have and...

558
00:35:52,389 --> 00:35:55,208
Well, I'm falling in love with you.

559
00:36:00,277 --> 00:36:02,049
Whether you open up to me or not,

560
00:36:02,759 --> 00:36:04,463
I'm falling in love with you.

561
00:36:16,198 --> 00:36:19,932
My father sexually abused me.

562
00:36:29,442 --> 00:36:30,698
He, uh...

563
00:36:32,701 --> 00:36:34,932
he tries to contact me every so often,

564
00:36:35,616 --> 00:36:37,054
try and make amends,

565
00:36:38,121 --> 00:36:40,540
but I have no interest.

566
00:36:42,815 --> 00:36:44,107
I've moved on.

567
00:36:48,525 --> 00:36:50,814
Um, I'm not telling you this
because you asked me to,

568
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:54,492
or because you told me

569
00:36:54,517 --> 00:36:56,662
you-you're falling in love with me,

570
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:01,286
or even because I'm falling
in love with you, too.

571
00:37:02,643 --> 00:37:04,304
I'm telling you this because my father

572
00:37:04,329 --> 00:37:06,824
has already ruined so much for me,

573
00:37:08,866 --> 00:37:10,994
and I'm not gonna let him
ruin this, too.

574
00:37:17,636 --> 00:37:19,305
I d... I didn't, um...

575
00:37:22,197 --> 00:37:24,516
It's just you-you always seem
so strong, you know.

576
00:37:24,541 --> 00:37:26,064
I-I didn't, uh...

577
00:37:28,751 --> 00:37:30,197
I am strong.

578
00:37:53,697 --> 00:37:54,841
Thank you.

579
00:37:57,586 --> 00:37:58,753
How'd it go?

580
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:01,476
Uh, it went okay.

581
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:04,944
How did it go, your visit?

582
00:38:05,384 --> 00:38:09,488
Yeah, it went, uh,
as good as it could go.

583
00:38:17,917 --> 00:38:19,733
It's kind of nuts here, right?

584
00:38:20,296 --> 00:38:24,274
I mean, every day you wake up,
it's 73 and sunny.

585
00:38:24,534 --> 00:38:27,913
What is that? I like the rain.

586
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,369
They said that I was "Pittsburgh good,"

587
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:37,104
which I've decided to take
as a compliment.

588
00:38:43,886 --> 00:38:45,259
Can I hear the song?

589
00:38:48,741 --> 00:38:52,083
I think that I'm done singing for today.

590
00:38:53,762 --> 00:38:56,248
Bec, please.

591
00:38:57,855 --> 00:38:59,158
Bec?

592
00:39:00,331 --> 00:39:02,166
No one has ever called me that.

593
00:39:05,348 --> 00:39:06,624
I like it.
