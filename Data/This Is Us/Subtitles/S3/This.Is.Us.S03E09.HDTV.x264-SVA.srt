00:00:02,154 --> 00:00:04,484
The IV has worked. I'm pregnant.

3
00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:05,756
You know, Randall is the one

4
00:00:05,791 --> 00:00:07,525
running against me for city council.

5
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:09,293
So, uh, how many voters you register?

6
00:00:09,328 --> 00:00:10,695
- About 200.
- Ah.

7
00:00:10,729 --> 00:00:13,234
You only need around, uh, 20,000 more.

8
00:00:13,296 --> 00:00:16,234
I mean, pretty soon you're gonna
have your first boyfriend.

9
00:00:16,351 --> 00:00:18,820
Or... girlfriend.

10
00:00:19,031 --> 00:00:20,538
Or girlfriend.

11
00:00:20,572 --> 00:00:23,101
He gave me her necklace, right?
That means something.

12
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:24,289
<i>I'm gonna go to Vietnam</i>

13
00:00:24,314 --> 00:00:25,921
<i>and I'm gonna figure out my dad's story.</i>

14
00:00:25,946 --> 00:00:27,617
Jack, that really you?

15
00:00:27,642 --> 00:00:29,013
I'm gonna get you out of here.

16
00:00:30,182 --> 00:00:31,482
You got two weeks.

17
00:00:31,517 --> 00:00:33,281
You should have left me to rot.

18
00:00:36,101 --> 00:00:37,351
Everybody in?

19
00:00:45,492 --> 00:00:47,382
Nicky. Come on.

20
00:00:55,207 --> 00:00:56,312
Come on.

21
00:01:09,234 --> 00:01:10,421
<i>Roger that, sir.</i>

22
00:01:10,446 --> 00:01:11,859
I'm-I'm aware you said two weeks.

23
00:01:11,884 --> 00:01:14,156
I was hoping you'd be
a little flexible with...

24
00:01:14,984 --> 00:01:16,562
Oh, no, no. No, it's...

25
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:19,914
Sir, if I just had
a few extra days, I...

26
00:01:21,335 --> 00:01:22,671
Affirmative.

27
00:01:22,861 --> 00:01:23,921
Out.

28
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:32,416
Hey. I've been looking
everywhere for you.

29
00:01:33,076 --> 00:01:35,562
Yeah, I didn't really feel
like being found.

30
00:01:37,484 --> 00:01:39,695
Okay, well, come on.
I want to take you someplace.

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,234
No, thanks.

32
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:43,359
Hey, Nicky, I...

33
00:01:43,488 --> 00:01:47,758
I know it must be a lot
for you right now

34
00:01:47,793 --> 00:01:52,062
without any drugs in your system
to push it all down. I...

35
00:01:52,734 --> 00:01:55,242
That's an astute observation,
Dr. Pearson.

36
00:01:55,434 --> 00:01:57,062
It really is, but unless you got

37
00:01:57,087 --> 00:01:59,870
any military business with me,
I'm gonna be on my way.

38
00:01:59,905 --> 00:02:01,203
Hey, hey, hey.

39
00:02:01,228 --> 00:02:02,367
Stop.

40
00:02:03,273 --> 00:02:05,101
Stop. Just stop.

41
00:02:17,688 --> 00:02:19,148
That feel good, huh?

42
00:02:29,335 --> 00:02:32,867
I got 48 hours left with you, kid.

43
00:02:34,335 --> 00:02:35,585
That's all.

44
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:39,171
48 hours, then you are back
on your own base.

45
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,976
And I don't know what after that.

46
00:02:53,296 --> 00:02:55,071
Where did you want to take me, again?

48
00:03:08,679 --> 00:03:10,545
Okay, the rain finally stopped.

49
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:13,132
This is good. We should be able
to get to the village by tomorrow.

50
00:03:13,157 --> 00:03:14,703
- Maybe.
- Yeah.

51
00:03:14,806 --> 00:03:16,562
Or maybe the roads will still be blocked

52
00:03:16,587 --> 00:03:19,015
and we'll have to go
the next day or the next.

53
00:03:19,488 --> 00:03:21,343
Just try and go with the flow.

54
00:03:24,015 --> 00:03:27,925
Right. Yeah. Just, you know...
go with the flow.

55
00:03:27,966 --> 00:03:29,623
Just... except that's impossible.

56
00:03:29,648 --> 00:03:30,961
This is excruciating, you know.

57
00:03:30,996 --> 00:03:32,997
Like, we're 50 miles away
from where my dad served,

58
00:03:33,031 --> 00:03:34,390
and we're trapped here.

59
00:03:34,566 --> 00:03:36,460
You know, it's like we're stuck
in one of those

60
00:03:36,635 --> 00:03:39,170
Netflix documentaries, like the
pizza bomber one, you know?

61
00:03:39,204 --> 00:03:40,912
Where they just unraveling
all the clues.

62
00:03:40,937 --> 00:03:42,006
And then you have to watch, right?

63
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,234
'Cause you're at the last episode.

64
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:45,102
The one where you finally find out

65
00:03:45,243 --> 00:03:47,712
who the woman wearing my dad's
necklace in the photo was,

66
00:03:47,746 --> 00:03:50,448
and how he met her and just,

67
00:03:50,482 --> 00:03:52,445
you know, all of it.

68
00:03:53,476 --> 00:03:56,007
The thing about documentaries
is, you can't force them

69
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,851
to end the way you want them to.

70
00:04:00,025 --> 00:04:01,359
I-I know.

71
00:04:08,578 --> 00:04:09,951
Hello, Mr. Pearson.

72
00:04:09,976 --> 00:04:11,375
- Hey.
- I wanted to bring

73
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,734
a complimentary breakfast
to my favorite guest.

74
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:15,373
- That's very nice. Thank you so much.
- Oh, wow. Thank you.

75
00:04:15,398 --> 00:04:16,968
And-and I don't want you
to think that I forgot

76
00:04:16,993 --> 00:04:18,762
about that shirtless selfie
that you wanted for your sister.

77
00:04:18,787 --> 00:04:20,140
I'm gonna do that for you tomorrow.

78
00:04:20,562 --> 00:04:21,607
I have good news for you.

79
00:04:21,632 --> 00:04:23,343
The roads are finally clear
from the rains.

80
00:04:23,368 --> 00:04:25,289
I can take you on the tour
of Sông Trà tomorrow.

81
00:04:25,314 --> 00:04:27,385
- Great. That'd be wonderful, thank you.
- Great.

82
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:28,853
Okay. I'll have the car ready

83
00:04:28,887 --> 00:04:31,021
at 8:00 a.m., which means...

84
00:04:31,056 --> 00:04:32,820
Shirtless selfie at 7:45. Yeah. Got it.

85
00:04:32,845 --> 00:04:34,345
No problem. Thank you.

86
00:04:34,593 --> 00:04:36,318
Manny <i>nói gi!</i>

87
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:38,597
- Ah.
- Manny <i>nói gi!</i>

88
00:04:38,622 --> 00:04:40,031
<i>I'm not gonna do it.</i>

89
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:45,169
Okay, so your
ultrasound just now looks great.

90
00:04:45,203 --> 00:04:46,375
Second one in a row.

91
00:04:46,948 --> 00:04:50,017
Also, your NIPT results
came back normal.

92
00:04:50,062 --> 00:04:52,226
No chromosomal abnormalities.

93
00:04:52,523 --> 00:04:55,246
The test also reveals
the sex of the baby.

94
00:04:55,334 --> 00:04:56,768
Do you want to know what it is?

95
00:04:57,337 --> 00:05:00,554
Uh... I say let's wait.

96
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:03,695
- We can be surprised.
- Yeah.

97
00:05:03,726 --> 00:05:04,945
Surprise it is.

98
00:05:05,863 --> 00:05:07,797
Now the less fun news.

99
00:05:08,187 --> 00:05:11,281
This job you mentioned,
the singing telegrams.

100
00:05:11,306 --> 00:05:15,070
Adele-o-grams.
I sing Adele as a telegram.

101
00:05:15,656 --> 00:05:17,046
- Right.
- Adele-o-gram.

102
00:05:17,071 --> 00:05:19,875
You mentioned that has you
driving a lot,

103
00:05:20,046 --> 00:05:22,173
sometimes to places a couple hours away.

104
00:05:22,276 --> 00:05:23,740
Yeah. Is that a problem, or...?

105
00:05:23,765 --> 00:05:25,632
I don't love you sitting that much.

106
00:05:26,234 --> 00:05:28,656
Your blood pressure is still
higher than I'd like.

107
00:05:28,991 --> 00:05:31,687
But of course, I can't tell you
to quit your job.

108
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,289
<i>Copacetic.</i>

109
00:05:35,314 --> 00:05:36,562
Copacetic.

110
00:05:36,673 --> 00:05:42,414
C-O-P-A-C-E-T-I-C.

111
00:05:42,507 --> 00:05:43,882
Oh, dang, girl.

112
00:05:43,907 --> 00:05:47,000
You are gonna demolish
this spelling bee. Way to go.

113
00:05:47,025 --> 00:05:49,515
Hey, Randall, can I talk to you
for a minute?

114
00:05:51,903 --> 00:05:53,070
Busted.

115
00:05:53,752 --> 00:05:54,918
Night, baby.

116
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:56,468
- Night, Dad.
- I love you.

117
00:05:56,493 --> 00:05:57,585
Love you, too.

118
00:06:02,447 --> 00:06:05,149
You have a debate
with Sol Brown tomorrow

119
00:06:05,183 --> 00:06:07,781
and you haven't gone over any
of your talking points all day.

120
00:06:07,806 --> 00:06:09,987
I'm off the campaign one week
and you're slipping?

121
00:06:10,021 --> 00:06:11,187
You know you didn't have to leave.

122
00:06:11,212 --> 00:06:12,281
Yes, I did.

123
00:06:12,306 --> 00:06:14,210
And it was best for the both of us.

124
00:06:14,553 --> 00:06:17,906
And you apologized profusely
with chocolate.

125
00:06:18,053 --> 00:06:20,688
- Hmm.
- Now you need to practice.

126
00:06:20,832 --> 00:06:21,953
I'll quiz you.

127
00:06:21,978 --> 00:06:23,632
You sure you don't mind helping me?

128
00:06:23,881 --> 00:06:27,113
I'm happy to help... in an unofficial,

129
00:06:27,138 --> 00:06:29,340
like, best-wife-in-the-world capacity.

130
00:06:29,374 --> 00:06:30,664
Oh, I love that capacity.

131
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:32,500
That's my favorite capacity.

132
00:06:33,945 --> 00:06:34,967
Night, Tess.

133
00:06:34,992 --> 00:06:36,304
- Night.
- Hey, Tess.

134
00:06:36,448 --> 00:06:39,226
Remember, Grandma's picking you
up tomorrow after gymnastics

135
00:06:39,251 --> 00:06:40,618
to take you to meet us at the debate.

136
00:06:41,092 --> 00:06:43,585
- Fine.
- Good night, sweet pea.

137
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,875
That pea has not been as sweet as usual.

138
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,702
Yeah. Something's up with her.

139
00:06:50,727 --> 00:06:52,195
Okay, I got to go.

140
00:06:52,263 --> 00:06:54,867
Yeah, they make us go to bed mad early.

141
00:06:55,617 --> 00:06:56,997
All right, love you, too, Mom.

142
00:06:57,414 --> 00:06:58,562
Bye.

143
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:05,593
Deja calls her mom?

144
00:07:05,618 --> 00:07:07,945
I had no idea. That's news to me.

145
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:09,280
I didn't know they were back in touch.

146
00:07:09,314 --> 00:07:10,992
Ooh, we should talk to her.

147
00:07:11,179 --> 00:07:13,117
I mean, let her know it's okay
if they're communicating,

148
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,718
but we should be kept
in the loop, right?

149
00:07:14,753 --> 00:07:16,781
- Yeah, but... Wait, hold on, hold on.
- What?

150
00:07:17,188 --> 00:07:19,101
We have to think about how to do this.

151
00:07:19,126 --> 00:07:21,367
And you need to focus on this debate.

152
00:07:21,392 --> 00:07:23,527
This family is not gonna be
the thing that keeps you

153
00:07:23,562 --> 00:07:24,976
from succeeding tomorrow.

154
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:26,867
This family lifts each other up.

155
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,218
You hear me?

156
00:07:28,243 --> 00:07:29,359
Do I hear you?

157
00:07:29,601 --> 00:07:31,164
You're my favorite sound in the world.

158
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:34,007
- Of course I hear you.
- Don't be soft, man. Come on.

159
00:07:34,484 --> 00:07:37,242
- City taxes and statistics.
- Yes, ma'am.

160
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:46,343
This is the spot.

161
00:07:51,582 --> 00:07:54,210
Out here war feels far away.

162
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:58,296
Still there, though.

163
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:00,913
Yeah, but look,

164
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:03,215
look how tiny the ville looks from here,

165
00:08:03,421 --> 00:08:05,889
you know, when you get a little
bit of distance from it.

166
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,828
That's what this war's gonna be for you.

167
00:08:10,976 --> 00:08:11,990
For us.

168
00:08:12,142 --> 00:08:15,046
Just a... distant memory.

169
00:08:18,343 --> 00:08:19,859
So we do our tour,

170
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,007
we stay alive,

171
00:08:22,781 --> 00:08:24,562
and then we get the hell outta here.

172
00:08:25,507 --> 00:08:26,742
But we can't do that

173
00:08:26,767 --> 00:08:29,769
if you don't stay focused
on the mission.

174
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:33,132
Mission is to kill.

175
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,562
No, Nicky.

176
00:08:37,447 --> 00:08:39,093
Mission is to get home.

177
00:08:53,671 --> 00:08:55,053
No vehicles can pass through.

178
00:08:55,078 --> 00:08:56,445
We have to walk the rest of the way.

179
00:08:57,234 --> 00:09:00,085
Wow, it's beautiful here.

180
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:02,523
Your father's camp's a little
beyond this ridge here.

181
00:09:02,548 --> 00:09:03,554
Yeah?

182
00:09:03,579 --> 00:09:04,955
My Uncle Nick served here as well.

183
00:09:05,247 --> 00:09:06,881
- 46th Infantry.
- Mm-hmm.

184
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:10,132
- Died over here, actually.
- Oh. I'm so sorry.

185
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,197
Listen, there's, uh, this woman
in all these old photographs.

186
00:09:15,231 --> 00:09:16,531
- Mm-hmm.
- That's my dad here.

187
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:18,415
You think there's a chance
she might still be there?

188
00:09:18,441 --> 00:09:20,175
There's one man who was there
during the war

189
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:21,257
when he was a young boy.

190
00:09:21,282 --> 00:09:23,218
He's a local historian of sorts.

191
00:09:23,288 --> 00:09:24,555
He's agreed to speak with you today.

192
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,847
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

193
00:09:27,718 --> 00:09:31,250
Next episode begins
in five, four, three...

194
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:34,064
- 'Cause it's Netflix.
- Got it.

195
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,687
Maybe you could walk
to your Adele-o-grams,

196
00:09:37,874 --> 00:09:39,851
and only say yes
to the really close gigs.

197
00:09:40,085 --> 00:09:41,859
I can't be that picky, Madison.

198
00:09:42,054 --> 00:09:44,570
I mean, there aren't many people
looking to pay a random woman

199
00:09:44,595 --> 00:09:46,390
to dress up as Adele and sing for them.

200
00:09:46,714 --> 00:09:49,816
And I know that stopping is
the right thing to do.

201
00:09:50,076 --> 00:09:51,914
But my job was the one thing that I had

202
00:09:51,939 --> 00:09:53,492
to relieve stress during the pregnancy.

203
00:09:54,062 --> 00:09:55,351
So let's fix this.

204
00:09:55,793 --> 00:09:57,794
We just have to find you
another job you love

205
00:09:57,819 --> 00:09:59,765
that doesn't have you stuck
in a car for hours.

206
00:10:00,062 --> 00:10:02,828
Oh, my God, I just had one of those
things that happens to drunks.

207
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:04,421
- What's it called?
- A hangover?

208
00:10:04,446 --> 00:10:05,695
A moment of clarity.

209
00:10:05,945 --> 00:10:07,265
Martin Van Buren.

210
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:09,604
Listen, these are tumultuous times,

211
00:10:09,629 --> 00:10:10,862
- but I'm not running for president.
- No.

212
00:10:10,887 --> 00:10:13,320
I volunteer at Van Buren High downtown.

213
00:10:13,601 --> 00:10:15,984
They need a chorus teacher, like, ASAP.

214
00:10:16,009 --> 00:10:17,453
Mr. Fitch got hit by a bus.

215
00:10:17,478 --> 00:10:18,890
- Oh, no.
- No, he's fine.

216
00:10:18,934 --> 00:10:22,265
He was in another bus.
Two buses ran into each other.

217
00:10:23,093 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm e-mailing Principal Griffith
right now.

218
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:26,812
We are super tight,
and they are gonna love you.

219
00:10:31,007 --> 00:10:32,726
Okay, remember, we want to stay focused

220
00:10:32,751 --> 00:10:34,257
on personal stories out there, okay?

221
00:10:34,414 --> 00:10:36,242
Keep the facts and figures
bite-size, Randall.

222
00:10:36,267 --> 00:10:37,646
- Yeah.
- C-O...

223
00:10:37,806 --> 00:10:38,812
- Hey.
- Hmm?

224
00:10:38,837 --> 00:10:40,273
Facts and figures bite-size. Say it.

225
00:10:40,298 --> 00:10:41,945
Hey, what's going on
with you over there?

226
00:10:41,973 --> 00:10:43,859
Your Insta story
blowing up or something?

227
00:10:43,884 --> 00:10:45,062
Hey, Jae-won, would you mind

228
00:10:45,087 --> 00:10:46,468
taking the girls to their seats for me?

229
00:10:46,882 --> 00:10:48,460
Of course. Come on, ladies.

230
00:10:48,695 --> 00:10:49,830
10 minutes, folks.

231
00:10:49,831 --> 00:10:52,953
Annie, can you spell
"career defining moment"?

232
00:10:55,398 --> 00:10:56,398
Close your eyes.

233
00:10:56,423 --> 00:10:58,257
- Beth, I'm trying to...
- Close your eyes.

234
00:11:01,621 --> 00:11:05,359
I want you to see yourself
going out there and killing it.

235
00:11:05,385 --> 00:11:06,664
You are prepared,

236
00:11:07,121 --> 00:11:08,945
you're wearing the hell out of that suit

237
00:11:09,277 --> 00:11:11,960
and you were born to do this.

238
00:11:12,782 --> 00:11:15,601
Whatever they throw at you,
I want you to return it.

239
00:11:15,732 --> 00:11:16,899
Like Serena.

240
00:11:17,351 --> 00:11:21,140
You are fierce, dignified

241
00:11:21,165 --> 00:11:23,054
and in top form.

242
00:11:23,612 --> 00:11:24,781
Can you see it?

243
00:11:26,257 --> 00:11:28,656
I'm mostly just seeing Serena
Williams in that catsuit,

244
00:11:28,681 --> 00:11:30,782
but yes... no, thank you.

245
00:11:31,453 --> 00:11:32,703
I can see it.

246
00:11:33,303 --> 00:11:34,445
Good.

247
00:11:36,164 --> 00:11:37,412
<i>I'm very excited</i>

248
00:11:37,437 --> 00:11:39,796
about seeing your dad
on that debate stage.

249
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm actually kind of nervous.

250
00:11:43,945 --> 00:11:45,195
Even though I don't have to do anything

251
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,562
but sit there and watch.

252
00:11:47,294 --> 00:11:48,453
Oh...

253
00:11:49,891 --> 00:11:51,593
How's the school year treating you?

254
00:11:52,364 --> 00:11:53,671
- It's fine.
- Yeah?

255
00:11:55,531 --> 00:11:56,640
Middle school.

256
00:11:58,062 --> 00:11:59,828
I remember middle school.

257
00:12:01,195 --> 00:12:03,929
My God, the time I spent
worried about pimples.

258
00:12:06,102 --> 00:12:07,640
But you're doing okay?

259
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:10,242
You don't have any issues?

260
00:12:12,994 --> 00:12:14,304
Aunt Kate told you.

261
00:12:15,678 --> 00:12:16,960
Told me what?

262
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:23,867
She did.

263
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,132
Did she tell my parents?

264
00:12:31,205 --> 00:12:34,040
No, of course she didn't, sweetheart.

265
00:12:34,065 --> 00:12:36,562
No... and I promise
she only told me because

266
00:12:36,587 --> 00:12:39,377
she's across the country
and she just wanted someone

267
00:12:39,402 --> 00:12:41,375
to look out for you that was close by.

268
00:12:41,604 --> 00:12:42,812
That's it.

269
00:12:45,256 --> 00:12:49,421
You know, things today are very
different than they used to be.

270
00:12:50,656 --> 00:12:53,398
I mean, even ten years ago,
my good friends Jim and Paul

271
00:12:53,423 --> 00:12:55,523
- were trying to get...
- Grandma, I don't want to talk about it.

272
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,304
If I wanted to talk about it
with you, I would've told you.

273
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:03,195
Okay.

274
00:13:03,727 --> 00:13:06,125
I'm sorry. I understand...

275
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:05,714
So the first solo,

276
00:14:05,739 --> 00:14:08,034
the entire school is staring at me.

277
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:11,464
And I think it was "Fly Away
Home" or "I Believe I Can Fly."

278
00:14:11,636 --> 00:14:13,237
I don't remember. Somebody was flying.

279
00:14:13,262 --> 00:14:14,796
Anyhow, so I step forward,

280
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:17,737
open my mouth and I completely blanked.

281
00:14:17,762 --> 00:14:18,807
- No.
- Yes.

282
00:14:18,832 --> 00:14:20,042
And so, of course, I just
sing the first thing

283
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:22,128
that comes to mind:
"Wind Beneath My Wings."

284
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:24,922
- Also flying.
- Also flying. Right.

285
00:14:26,261 --> 00:14:29,354
Look, um, high school
was pretty tough for me.

286
00:14:29,464 --> 00:14:32,073
But chorus was the one thing that I had

287
00:14:32,098 --> 00:14:33,690
to look forward to every day.

288
00:14:34,736 --> 00:14:37,404
So I would just love to be
that person for these kids.

289
00:14:37,429 --> 00:14:38,901
You know, I could give them
a place where they...

290
00:14:38,926 --> 00:14:41,550
Look, Kate, I think you'd be great.

291
00:14:42,127 --> 00:14:45,384
- You do?
- So let's talk about your background.

292
00:14:45,409 --> 00:14:47,659
- Okay.
- Where'd you go to college?

293
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:51,143
Uh, the School of Hard Knocks,
class of '98?

294
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:54,151
You don't have a college degree?

295
00:14:54,553 --> 00:14:56,440
No. I mean, I...

296
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:58,854
I went, but I just never finished.

297
00:14:59,008 --> 00:15:00,339
I'm so sorry.

298
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:04,292
I just can't bring on anybody
without a college degree.

299
00:15:04,317 --> 00:15:05,831
State regulation...

300
00:15:06,521 --> 00:15:09,511
So even just changing
that number by three percent

301
00:15:09,536 --> 00:15:11,722
gets us to solvent in two years.

302
00:15:11,925 --> 00:15:13,518
So to answer your question, Alicia,

303
00:15:13,543 --> 00:15:16,645
efficiency in how we deal
with revenue is a huge issue.

304
00:15:16,932 --> 00:15:19,511
Our moderator's name is Elisa.

305
00:15:19,893 --> 00:15:23,182
WTUV's illustrious 6:00 anchor.

306
00:15:23,207 --> 00:15:25,354
Uh, excuse me.
I-I knew that. I misspoke.

307
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:27,980
Uh, maybe you have to live here
to get the pronunciation.

308
00:15:30,573 --> 00:15:35,103
Okay, I-I listen to your show
every night, Elisa.

309
00:15:35,128 --> 00:15:37,948
On his way home to Alpine, New Jersey.

310
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,172
Now, I don't have to tell you,

311
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,698
but Professor Pearson's math lecture

312
00:15:43,723 --> 00:15:46,909
was a long-winded way of saying
he'll raise your taxes.

313
00:15:46,934 --> 00:15:48,948
No, that's not...
that's not what I said.

314
00:15:48,973 --> 00:15:50,472
So no tax hike? You can guarantee that?

315
00:15:50,497 --> 00:15:51,698
I'm saying if we invest

316
00:15:51,723 --> 00:15:53,237
- in our community...
- Thank you.

317
00:15:53,374 --> 00:15:56,810
I'm glad you brought up
investing in our community,

318
00:15:57,047 --> 00:15:59,182
because it's something
that's very important to me.

319
00:16:07,963 --> 00:16:09,573
Oh, how's it going? Yeah.

320
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,581
What are you doing?

321
00:17:35,129 --> 00:17:36,300
Are you high?

322
00:17:45,246 --> 00:17:46,682
Where'd you get it from?

323
00:17:50,706 --> 00:17:52,143
You know, it doesn't matter.

324
00:17:53,788 --> 00:17:55,448
I'm gonna get you cleaned up again.

325
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:59,347
Get that out of your system.
Come on. Stand up.

326
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,268
Stand up. Come on. Get up.

327
00:18:01,528 --> 00:18:03,464
- No, no.
- Come on.

328
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:08,026
No. I don't want to get clean, Jack.

329
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:11,487
I see it all again when I'm clean.

330
00:18:15,484 --> 00:18:17,979
I'm not gonna complete the mission.

331
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:23,706
Don't follow me.

332
00:18:37,613 --> 00:18:39,425
I was actually really
excited about the idea

333
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:40,886
of being a chorus teacher.

334
00:18:42,066 --> 00:18:44,034
All because of eight freaking credits.

335
00:18:44,886 --> 00:18:47,073
Maybe you're just not supposed
to be working right now...

336
00:18:47,972 --> 00:18:50,212
he said in the most
supportive way possible,

337
00:18:50,247 --> 00:18:52,729
not meaning it all
and regretting it instantly.

338
00:18:53,245 --> 00:18:54,557
So you're glad that I didn't get it.

339
00:18:54,582 --> 00:18:57,292
No, of course not. I just think

340
00:18:57,317 --> 00:19:00,972
that maybe you should just take
this time to relax.

341
00:19:01,604 --> 00:19:03,440
Toby, I can't relax.

342
00:19:03,784 --> 00:19:05,862
I need to have other things
going on in my life.

343
00:19:06,057 --> 00:19:08,393
I can't just sit around
waiting for this baby to come

344
00:19:08,418 --> 00:19:11,784
because I just I don't believe
it's actually ever coming.

345
00:19:13,339 --> 00:19:16,237
Come on. The ultrasounds have
been good, you're doing great.

346
00:19:16,262 --> 00:19:17,831
Everything is gonna be fine.

347
00:19:18,425 --> 00:19:20,393
So why don't we want to know
the sex of the baby?

348
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,839
Because we like surprises.

349
00:19:24,047 --> 00:19:25,948
Tobe, we hate surprises.

350
00:19:26,573 --> 00:19:28,038
Do you remember Madison's
birthday, when that guy

351
00:19:28,063 --> 00:19:29,386
jumped out of the cake
and you peed a little?

352
00:19:29,411 --> 00:19:32,513
Okay, human beings are not
supposed to be in baked goods.

353
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:35,073
Admit it. We don't want to know

354
00:19:35,098 --> 00:19:36,979
if it's a boy or girl
because we're terrified.

355
00:19:37,781 --> 00:19:40,175
And we don't want to talk about
it because we're terrified.

356
00:19:43,045 --> 00:19:44,145
Kate...

357
00:19:44,374 --> 00:19:46,542
You know, let's forget it.

358
00:19:46,734 --> 00:19:47,893
Let's eat.

359
00:19:51,034 --> 00:19:53,222
And then there were
the bus stops that used to run

360
00:19:53,247 --> 00:19:55,081
through our district
that just disappeared.

361
00:19:55,226 --> 00:19:56,706
And Sol Brown did nothing about it.

362
00:19:56,831 --> 00:19:59,982
Once again, Randall Pearson
has his facts about me wrong.

363
00:20:00,016 --> 00:20:02,511
No, all due respect,
I've seen my tenants return home

364
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:05,214
bone tired after walking
miles from work.

365
00:20:05,257 --> 00:20:06,362
And that's a fact.

366
00:20:06,387 --> 00:20:09,878
They wanted to eliminate
the entire 112 route.

367
00:20:10,096 --> 00:20:13,526
I convinced SEPTA to consolidate
a few stops instead

368
00:20:13,551 --> 00:20:16,182
so the people would have
something instead of nothing.

369
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:19,136
Did you know that?

370
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:21,089
No, I did not.

371
00:20:21,114 --> 00:20:23,749
Well, I'm sure it's hard to keep
abreast all the way from Alpine.

372
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:26,643
It's again with the Alpine, man, you...

373
00:20:35,036 --> 00:20:38,146
Look, you all...
you all have seen my flyer.

374
00:20:40,157 --> 00:20:43,255
You know that I was adopted
by a white family in Pittsburgh.

375
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,669
With all due respect, I'm not
sure what your upbringing

376
00:20:45,694 --> 00:20:48,294
has to do with balancing
city budgets or taxes.

377
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:50,263
Actually, it has everything
to do with it.

378
00:20:50,288 --> 00:20:52,490
- Actually, it doesn't.
- No, but actually it does.

379
00:20:52,515 --> 00:20:54,646
Now, you got to say your
piece, brother Brown.

380
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:56,740
Give me a chance to say
mine, if you would.

381
00:21:01,988 --> 00:21:07,036
As I was saying, I was adopted
by a white family in Pittsburgh.

382
00:21:08,263 --> 00:21:10,872
I know what it's like
to have people look at you

383
00:21:10,897 --> 00:21:12,302
like you don't belong,

384
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:16,130
to overlook you,
to underestimate you. To...

385
00:21:19,607 --> 00:21:22,064
Is this all just to tell us
you're the best candidate

386
00:21:22,098 --> 00:21:23,693
'cause you were overlooked as a kid?

387
00:21:23,718 --> 00:21:25,534
I'm not the best candidate
because <i>I'm</i> overlooked,

388
00:21:25,569 --> 00:21:26,902
Mr. Brown, I'm the best candidate

389
00:21:26,937 --> 00:21:28,505
because the 12th district is.

390
00:21:34,315 --> 00:21:37,990
Now, you've all been overlooked,
taken for granted,

391
00:21:38,015 --> 00:21:40,150
underestimated by this councilman,

392
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:43,333
who thinks he can ignore you
until it's election time,

393
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,951
and then announce some initiative

394
00:21:44,976 --> 00:21:46,710
from up on this stage, like he's some...

395
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:54,638
You know what?

396
00:22:11,323 --> 00:22:13,036
I've been reading the minutes
from the last four

397
00:22:13,061 --> 00:22:15,966
city council public meetings, okay?

398
00:22:17,199 --> 00:22:22,396
Last November, Elaine Wallace complained

399
00:22:22,421 --> 00:22:24,522
about the water in her son's school.

400
00:22:24,884 --> 00:22:26,622
- Right? Yes.
- Yes. Yeah.

401
00:22:27,284 --> 00:22:28,974
And Sol said he'd look into it.

402
00:22:29,231 --> 00:22:30,841
That was over a year ago.

403
00:22:32,052 --> 00:22:34,622
James Wallace told him that
his snow wasn't getting plowed.

404
00:22:34,704 --> 00:22:36,185
He couldn't even make it to work.

405
00:22:36,426 --> 00:22:39,544
He came back to complain
three more times.

406
00:22:39,569 --> 00:22:41,470
- Damn right, I said it.
- Thank you, sir.

407
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:46,294
Helen Farmer couldn't get
a ten-month-old pothole fixed.

408
00:22:46,529 --> 00:22:50,161
Grace Wright couldn't get
an access ramp at her building.

409
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,661
The list is endless.

410
00:22:53,474 --> 00:22:56,607
The "I'll look into its" are endless.

411
00:22:59,143 --> 00:23:00,411
I, uh...

412
00:23:01,744 --> 00:23:03,646
This is a complicated job,

413
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:06,013
and I will have a lot to learn.

414
00:23:06,447 --> 00:23:07,951
But I can promise you this.

415
00:23:09,139 --> 00:23:11,271
I will never let them take
eight of your bus stops

416
00:23:11,296 --> 00:23:13,185
just because they leave you with three.

417
00:23:16,594 --> 00:23:20,847
I will fight side by side
with you for better schools,

418
00:23:20,872 --> 00:23:23,349
fair housing and for more jobs.

419
00:23:25,574 --> 00:23:29,210
I will fight to make sure
that your snow gets plowed

420
00:23:29,235 --> 00:23:30,869
in the winter, and if it doesn't,

421
00:23:30,894 --> 00:23:32,958
I will do more than just "look into it."

422
00:23:32,983 --> 00:23:34,646
I swear to God that I will show up,

423
00:23:34,671 --> 00:23:36,038
and I will shovel it with you.

424
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:42,326
Take a chance on me.

425
00:23:42,996 --> 00:23:45,398
Take a chance on the man
with the shovel.

426
00:23:45,877 --> 00:23:48,505
Take a chance! Take a chance!

427
00:23:49,396 --> 00:23:52,981
Take a chance. Take a chance.

428
00:24:00,435 --> 00:24:03,740
Ah. That was wonderful food. Right, Kev?

429
00:24:03,748 --> 00:24:05,536
Ex... Wonderful. Excellent.

430
00:24:07,357 --> 00:24:12,022
Um, I'd really like to show you
something, if that's okay.

431
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:21,871
- Is that man your father?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

432
00:24:21,896 --> 00:24:25,035
That's my dad. Um, he spent
some time here in this village

433
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:27,013
- when he was in Vietnam.
- Hmm.

434
00:24:32,786 --> 00:24:35,112
His father used to sneak
in the fence every week

435
00:24:35,146 --> 00:24:36,647
to visit him and his mother.

436
00:24:37,966 --> 00:24:39,450
Your father was VC?

437
00:24:40,115 --> 00:24:41,351
VC.

438
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,161
Our fathers fought each other.

439
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:54,646
You recognize him?

440
00:24:57,794 --> 00:24:59,708
No. No.

441
00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:03,340
Well, uh, what about her, huh?

442
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,316
My father never spoke of her,

443
00:25:05,341 --> 00:25:06,864
but he's got all these
photographs of her.

444
00:25:06,889 --> 00:25:08,161
Do you recognize her?

445
00:25:16,906 --> 00:25:19,365
He does not know her.
She does not live here.

446
00:25:24,194 --> 00:25:25,216
Yeah.

447
00:25:33,838 --> 00:25:35,472
What's-what's this?

448
00:25:35,685 --> 00:25:37,310
You make American television.

449
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,888
- Make people laugh.
- Mm.

450
00:25:41,099 --> 00:25:42,707
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

451
00:25:42,732 --> 00:25:43,966
Something like that. I do...

452
00:25:43,991 --> 00:25:46,071
Do-do you... Are you sure?
One more look, you don't...

453
00:25:55,708 --> 00:25:57,519
My father was an actor of sorts.

454
00:25:57,544 --> 00:25:59,830
That is, he was very good at pretend.

455
00:26:00,052 --> 00:26:01,661
When he would sneak back to visit,

456
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,367
he never told us he was a soldier,

457
00:26:03,401 --> 00:26:05,005
off fighting a deadly war.

458
00:26:12,685 --> 00:26:15,078
He would say he was off
exploring distant lands.

459
00:26:15,271 --> 00:26:16,547
Fantasy lands.

460
00:26:16,752 --> 00:26:17,990
Other worlds.

461
00:26:27,935 --> 00:26:30,394
He would describe
magical places he had been.

462
00:26:30,786 --> 00:26:33,943
Places where the sky was
green and animals spoke.

463
00:26:39,185 --> 00:26:41,958
He was a good actor. Maybe like you.

464
00:27:02,326 --> 00:27:05,568
Our fathers were enemies,
but they were not so different.

465
00:27:06,122 --> 00:27:07,911
They both hid their war stories.

466
00:27:08,132 --> 00:27:10,669
They both pretended to be okay
for their children.

467
00:27:11,342 --> 00:27:12,396
Mm.

468
00:27:20,545 --> 00:27:21,935
And now, here we sit,

469
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:26,159
happy, healthy, sharing a meal

470
00:27:26,184 --> 00:27:28,005
in a place where
our fathers once fought.

471
00:27:42,146 --> 00:27:44,201
It may not be the answer
you're looking for,

472
00:27:45,115 --> 00:27:47,865
but maybe it's the answer
to something bigger.

473
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:56,701
Yeah. Maybe.

474
00:28:00,615 --> 00:28:01,849
Thank you.

475
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:05,677
There you go.
Sorry, this is my last one.

476
00:28:07,755 --> 00:28:11,279
Wow. I can't believe we
handed out all those fliers.

477
00:28:11,598 --> 00:28:12,755
Yeah.

478
00:28:22,406 --> 00:28:23,551
Ooh...

479
00:28:25,439 --> 00:28:26,607
Ooh.

480
00:28:30,243 --> 00:28:32,192
I have this pain in my wrist.

481
00:28:33,154 --> 00:28:34,513
And my neck.

482
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,974
And my back.

483
00:28:36,716 --> 00:28:39,161
Ugh, I've had it since I was in my 20s.

484
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:42,519
I have this theory

485
00:28:42,544 --> 00:28:46,939
that I used to keep all of my emotions

486
00:28:46,964 --> 00:28:51,669
so bottled up that...
it started to affect my body.

487
00:28:55,201 --> 00:28:56,693
I lost a child.

488
00:28:58,497 --> 00:29:00,169
I buried that real deep.

489
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:03,404
I never talked about it, ever.

490
00:29:06,583 --> 00:29:09,052
And I kept some secrets
from my husband, too.

491
00:29:09,087 --> 00:29:10,771
And from your father.

492
00:29:12,818 --> 00:29:14,201
But you know that.

493
00:29:14,859 --> 00:29:16,259
I'm not proud of that.

494
00:29:18,896 --> 00:29:23,133
At first, it started out with...

495
00:29:23,927 --> 00:29:26,482
a headache, or an upset stomach.

496
00:29:27,163 --> 00:29:31,875
But eventually, oh, I started to ache

497
00:29:31,909 --> 00:29:33,812
all the way into my bones.

498
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:37,632
And I don't want that
for you, sweetheart.

499
00:29:39,093 --> 00:29:40,584
I'm not saying that you have to go

500
00:29:40,618 --> 00:29:42,943
and have a conversation
you're not ready to have.

501
00:29:42,968 --> 00:29:46,857
You talk to your parents when
you decide the time is right.

502
00:29:49,515 --> 00:29:53,096
You're my first grandbaby,
and I love you so much.

503
00:29:53,406 --> 00:29:55,899
I just don't want you to become
an old woman, like me,

504
00:29:55,933 --> 00:30:00,937
carrying around ibuprofen
in your purse like candy.

505
00:30:04,742 --> 00:30:06,038
Welcome to Harvard.

506
00:30:06,351 --> 00:30:08,378
Or the Harvard
of the San Fernando Valley,

507
00:30:08,412 --> 00:30:10,614
aka Encino Community College.

508
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:12,413
What are we doing here?

509
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:13,820
Well...

510
00:30:14,008 --> 00:30:15,842
...you've always said that
you wanted to finish school.

511
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:18,656
I think the time is now.

512
00:30:19,464 --> 00:30:23,468
Look, I-I know that we're terrified,

513
00:30:24,335 --> 00:30:25,920
but not buying into this pregnancy

514
00:30:25,945 --> 00:30:27,798
isn't gonna make it any less scary,

515
00:30:27,832 --> 00:30:30,133
and it's not gonna make it hurt any less

516
00:30:30,168 --> 00:30:31,802
if something goes wrong.

517
00:30:33,038 --> 00:30:35,038
You're right, it won't.

518
00:30:35,453 --> 00:30:37,908
Kate, we're gonna be parents.

519
00:30:38,156 --> 00:30:40,396
We have six months
to jump a bunch of hurdles

520
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:43,446
before our life becomes
consumed by poop and naps.

521
00:30:43,481 --> 00:30:44,915
And do not say that my life
is already consumed

522
00:30:44,949 --> 00:30:46,416
by poop and naps, even though it is.

523
00:30:47,587 --> 00:30:48,887
Look, you get this degree,

524
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:50,453
and I think it closes a loop for you

525
00:30:50,488 --> 00:30:51,617
that's been open for far too long.

526
00:30:51,642 --> 00:30:53,476
Better yet, I think it makes you smile.

527
00:30:53,953 --> 00:30:57,294
And when you smile, the world is
a better place. See?

528
00:30:57,328 --> 00:30:58,829
The world just got a little better.

529
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,298
And that is the smile I want us to have

530
00:31:01,332 --> 00:31:03,413
when we talk about our kid from now on.

531
00:31:03,438 --> 00:31:06,507
That's the smile our kid
is going to inherit from you.

532
00:31:06,953 --> 00:31:08,328
<i>Our</i> kid...

533
00:31:10,796 --> 00:31:13,937
...who is coming,
safely and in good health.

534
00:31:15,421 --> 00:31:16,680
Okay?

535
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,367
So, what do you say?

536
00:31:19,569 --> 00:31:20,703
Hmm.

537
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:23,420
Where's the bursar's office?

538
00:31:23,859 --> 00:31:25,222
What's a bursar?

539
00:31:25,538 --> 00:31:27,234
The person that you pay to enroll.

540
00:31:27,499 --> 00:31:30,126
Mm... I don't think that's a word.

541
00:31:30,161 --> 00:31:31,328
Yes, it's a word.

542
00:31:31,353 --> 00:31:33,054
I don't have a college degree,
and I know that.

543
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:37,498
You Serena'd the crap
out of that debate.

544
00:31:38,586 --> 00:31:39,590
Mwah.

545
00:31:39,812 --> 00:31:40,971
- I kind of did, didn't I?
- Mm-hmm.

546
00:31:41,005 --> 00:31:42,101
Yeah, you really did.

547
00:31:42,126 --> 00:31:43,727
I'm hearing lots of positive feedback.

548
00:31:44,148 --> 00:31:45,492
- Great.
- Mm-hmm.

549
00:31:47,163 --> 00:31:49,846
All right, so why are you guys
staring at me like my breath stinks?

550
00:31:52,632 --> 00:31:54,482
While you were up there,
I got the results, uh...

551
00:31:54,507 --> 00:31:56,286
from the most recent poll.

552
00:31:57,499 --> 00:31:59,456
Um, I'm sorry, Randall,

553
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:01,191
unfortunately, Brown is too far ahead.

554
00:32:01,343 --> 00:32:03,835
More than we expected, by a lot.

555
00:32:04,054 --> 00:32:05,781
But you saw the people in here.

556
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:07,726
And the election's not for weeks.

557
00:32:08,249 --> 00:32:09,695
We don't have the time.

558
00:32:10,648 --> 00:32:12,187
You're not gonna win this one, Randall.

559
00:32:12,676 --> 00:32:14,046
The numbers aren't there.

560
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:15,781
I'm sorry.

561
00:32:18,815 --> 00:32:19,815
Huh.

562
00:32:23,666 --> 00:32:26,191
Any time's starting to
**** the flashcards

563
00:32:26,684 --> 00:32:28,685
Just said good night to Tess,

564
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,941
still can't get more than
two words out of her.

565
00:32:31,122 --> 00:32:34,152
- Deja?
- Sulking in her room.

566
00:32:34,283 --> 00:32:36,832
- No. Deja.
- Oh, hey.

567
00:32:39,984 --> 00:32:41,652
I want to go see my mom.

568
00:32:42,472 --> 00:32:44,535
She lives in Delaware and she has a job

569
00:32:44,569 --> 00:32:46,097
and I would like to go visit her.

570
00:32:46,246 --> 00:32:47,871
If that's okay.

571
00:32:52,246 --> 00:32:53,433
Okay.

572
00:32:55,879 --> 00:32:57,082
We'll figure it out.

573
00:32:57,863 --> 00:32:59,049
We'll look at our calendars

574
00:32:59,083 --> 00:33:01,730
and find a time
when one of us can take you.

575
00:33:03,433 --> 00:33:05,496
Okay. Thanks.

576
00:33:06,746 --> 00:33:08,910
- Good night.
- Night, Dej.

577
00:33:13,012 --> 00:33:14,972
- That is gonna be...
- Complicated.

578
00:33:15,147 --> 00:33:16,848
Mom? Dad?

579
00:33:17,324 --> 00:33:19,512
It's like an adolescent girl
conveyor belt in here.

580
00:33:19,591 --> 00:33:22,519
You okay, honey? What's up, honey?

581
00:33:23,957 --> 00:33:25,879
Nothing. Um...

582
00:33:27,944 --> 00:33:29,238
It's just...

583
00:33:30,321 --> 00:33:33,480
I'm sorry I've been so weird lately.

584
00:33:36,052 --> 00:33:37,190
I just...

585
00:33:38,363 --> 00:33:41,492
I feel uncomfortable around you guys

586
00:33:41,689 --> 00:33:42,987
all of a sudden.

587
00:33:43,693 --> 00:33:46,738
I have a stomachache all the time.

588
00:33:48,449 --> 00:33:51,268
- I don't want to keep secrets.
- Oh, hey.

589
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:54,230
It's okay. You can tell us.

590
00:33:56,082 --> 00:33:57,387
Um...

591
00:33:58,032 --> 00:34:00,160
People, um, at school

592
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:02,199
have been having crushes and stuff.

593
00:34:03,733 --> 00:34:06,581
And lots of girls

594
00:34:07,051 --> 00:34:08,418
have boyfriends,

595
00:34:10,346 --> 00:34:12,137
but I don't want one.

596
00:34:13,437 --> 00:34:16,401
That's perfectly okay.
You know, in fact,

597
00:34:16,426 --> 00:34:18,395
it's long been a dream of mine
that you never, ever...

598
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:20,644
It's because I think I might like girls,

599
00:34:21,533 --> 00:34:22,754
not boys.

600
00:34:29,621 --> 00:34:31,677
But I don't know.

601
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:33,051
Maybe I don't.

602
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:37,207
It's just... I didn't want
to tell you guys

603
00:34:38,027 --> 00:34:39,949
because I didn't want it
to become a thing.

604
00:34:42,465 --> 00:34:44,738
Hey, Tess. Tess.

605
00:34:45,965 --> 00:34:47,152
Listen.

606
00:34:48,066 --> 00:34:50,730
We're your parents.
We're here to help you.

607
00:34:52,551 --> 00:34:54,665
- I know...
- In a very cool,

608
00:34:54,863 --> 00:34:58,051
laid-back kind of way,
without it becoming a thing.

609
00:35:01,157 --> 00:35:02,354
We love you

610
00:35:03,896 --> 00:35:05,565
no matter what, okay?

611
00:35:08,027 --> 00:35:09,238
Look at me.

612
00:35:10,348 --> 00:35:11,519
You see me?

613
00:35:12,637 --> 00:35:13,980
Look at your dad.

614
00:35:15,282 --> 00:35:16,629
You see him?

615
00:35:19,415 --> 00:35:21,783
Do you see anything
other than two people

616
00:35:21,808 --> 00:35:25,699
who love you more than any two
people could ever love anyone

617
00:35:26,884 --> 00:35:28,551
in the entire world?

618
00:35:37,754 --> 00:35:38,801
Okay.

619
00:35:39,029 --> 00:35:40,316
Thanks.

620
00:35:43,317 --> 00:35:44,457
Um...

621
00:35:45,105 --> 00:35:47,535
I don't really want
to talk about it anymore.

622
00:35:48,073 --> 00:35:51,449
- Not right now, anyway.
- Okay. Cool.

623
00:35:53,036 --> 00:35:55,222
But if you change your mind, we're here.

624
00:35:58,129 --> 00:35:59,379
Night, Tess.

625
00:36:12,028 --> 00:36:14,485
And I thought I wasn't
gonna have wine tonight.

626
00:36:18,692 --> 00:36:19,909
Thanks.

627
00:36:24,722 --> 00:36:28,504
I don't know if I saw
that one coming. Did you?

628
00:36:29,371 --> 00:36:30,527
Nope.

629
00:36:36,934 --> 00:36:39,285
You know, I'm sorry
about the campaign, baby.

630
00:36:41,207 --> 00:36:44,307
But maybe this is a blessing, you know,

631
00:36:44,332 --> 00:36:46,410
- that-that it's over.
- Hey.

632
00:36:46,444 --> 00:36:49,652
You know what they say,
it's not over till it's over.

633
00:36:50,574 --> 00:36:53,316
Sorry, babe,
but it-it feels like it's over.

634
00:36:53,351 --> 00:36:55,074
But he didn't say I should drop out.

635
00:36:55,597 --> 00:36:57,535
Not in those words, but...

636
00:36:59,034 --> 00:37:02,229
Tess is going through
some major stuff right now.

637
00:37:02,254 --> 00:37:04,980
And Deja wants
to reconnect with her mom.

638
00:37:06,363 --> 00:37:08,131
I wanted this for you, babe.

639
00:37:08,308 --> 00:37:09,504
You know I did.

640
00:37:09,991 --> 00:37:12,703
I agreed to stretch our finances
to pay for the campaign,

641
00:37:12,737 --> 00:37:14,604
I-I took on more around the house

642
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:16,676
in the thick of my job search.

643
00:37:16,847 --> 00:37:19,843
But things are getting
really complicated

644
00:37:19,877 --> 00:37:21,511
and I-I can't afford to have you

645
00:37:21,546 --> 00:37:24,014
off chasing some impossible dream.

646
00:37:24,048 --> 00:37:26,293
I made promises to a community, Beth.

647
00:37:31,074 --> 00:37:33,690
You told me that, if at any point

648
00:37:33,769 --> 00:37:37,012
I wasn't on board with
you running, you would stop.

649
00:37:38,308 --> 00:37:40,816
I am no longer on board
with you running.

650
00:37:49,415 --> 00:37:50,715
I understand.

651
00:37:52,939 --> 00:37:54,238
And I love you.

652
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:58,548
And this family will always
be my priority.

653
00:37:58,583 --> 00:38:00,379
But I need to see this through, Beth.

654
00:38:05,636 --> 00:38:07,019
Damn, Randall.

655
00:38:09,238 --> 00:38:11,347
Maybe you can't win
this campaign, but...

656
00:38:12,402 --> 00:38:14,894
you sure did learn
how to talk like a politician.

657
00:38:34,777 --> 00:38:37,005
Listen, I'm sorry I dragged you
all the way out here

658
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:39,754
for... well, for nothing.

659
00:38:39,981 --> 00:38:41,535
- For nothing?
- Yeah.

660
00:38:42,143 --> 00:38:43,754
Kevin, w...

661
00:38:44,368 --> 00:38:47,394
we went to the same place
your father fought a war.

662
00:38:47,863 --> 00:38:50,715
We-we walked the same land he walked.

663
00:38:51,215 --> 00:38:53,036
That has to count for something,
doesn't it?

664
00:38:53,246 --> 00:38:55,004
I could've handled
an unpredictable ending.

665
00:38:55,029 --> 00:38:56,441
You know? But I...

666
00:38:57,722 --> 00:38:59,449
I didn't think I'd go home with nothing.

667
00:39:00,113 --> 00:39:02,644
Well, maybe it's not the ending.

668
00:39:03,583 --> 00:39:05,644
Maybe we're just in the middle.

669
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:14,791
- Hey, Doc.
- You seen my brother?

670
00:39:14,864 --> 00:39:16,035
Negative, Sarge.

671
00:39:21,271 --> 00:39:22,357
Hey.

672
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,802
- You guys seen Nicky?
- No, Sarge.

673
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:26,302
- No?
- Sorry, Sarge.

674
00:40:18,154 --> 00:40:19,161
Ready?

675
00:40:19,186 --> 00:40:20,685
You let your mom know we're on the way?

676
00:40:21,065 --> 00:40:22,396
I'll call her from the car.

677
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,325
Okay.

678
00:40:24,677 --> 00:40:27,546
Two, three, four, five, six.
One, two, one, two.

679
00:40:27,698 --> 00:40:29,633
Three, four, five, six...

680
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:31,902
Hey, boss. Tess called.

681
00:40:31,936 --> 00:40:34,404
- Says they're on the way.
- Okay, yeah.

682
00:40:35,622 --> 00:40:37,482
We're all going to see Randall's mother.

683
00:40:39,443 --> 00:40:41,091
Oh, did you bring the
Pin The Tail On The Donkey

684
00:40:41,116 --> 00:40:43,013
from my office? Thank you.

685
00:40:44,348 --> 00:40:45,700
I promised I'd bring it.

686
00:40:46,083 --> 00:40:49,452
- And up.
- Yes. Nice adjustment, dancers.

687
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:52,535
How do the people at the bakery

688
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,622
know what we're gonna have?

689
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:56,333
Dr. Jasper's office calls
and tells them the gender.

690
00:40:56,646 --> 00:40:58,029
It's, like, a thing people do.

691
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:00,599
Huh. What a world.

692
00:41:02,771 --> 00:41:03,943
Okay.

693
00:41:04,225 --> 00:41:05,763
- Okay.
- Ready?

694
00:41:17,865 --> 00:41:19,182
Oh, my God, it's a boy.

695
00:41:19,466 --> 00:41:21,851
- Blue means boy?
- Blue means boy.

696
00:41:22,479 --> 00:41:23,865
We're having a boy.

697
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:31,724
Murillo, what happened?!

698
00:41:31,874 --> 00:41:34,161
A boat exploded. I think one of
our guys was on it!

699
00:41:48,896 --> 00:41:51,466
I was going to suggest something
you could bring home from here,

700
00:41:51,716 --> 00:41:54,513
perhaps to lay on your war
memorial for your uncle one day.

701
00:41:54,852 --> 00:41:56,193
But I must've misheard

702
00:41:56,453 --> 00:41:58,988
because none of your family
died in the war.

703
00:42:00,154 --> 00:42:01,240
My Uncle Nick did.

704
00:42:01,265 --> 00:42:02,825
He died over here in the war.

705
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:04,693
Hmm.

706
00:42:06,411 --> 00:42:08,550
Whoa, hold on, so what-what is "hmm"?

707
00:42:08,575 --> 00:42:09,966
What's "hmm" mean?

708
00:42:10,529 --> 00:42:12,736
I went to a database
for the war memorial.

709
00:42:12,966 --> 00:42:15,411
Nicholas Pearson. 46th Infantry.

710
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:17,273
His name's not there.

711
00:42:17,536 --> 00:42:20,543
He might be dead, but he didn't
die here in Vietnam.

712
00:42:20,944 --> 00:42:22,599
Not in the war, anyway.
