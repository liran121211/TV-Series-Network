00:00:01,102 --> 00:00:02,636
Previously on This Is Us...

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:05,663
I'm Randall Pearson,
and I'm running for councilman

3
00:00:05,688 --> 00:00:06,789
for the 12th District.

4
00:00:06,814 --> 00:00:09,343
- You are not from here, honey.
- Go home.

5
00:00:09,473 --> 00:00:11,656
Beth, there is no easy way to say this.

6
00:00:11,681 --> 00:00:13,257
We have to let you go.

7
00:00:13,674 --> 00:00:14,875
It worked, baby.

8
00:00:15,789 --> 00:00:17,265
I'm pregnant.

9
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:22,237
The Jack I knew wanted everything

10
00:00:22,271 --> 00:00:24,109
from that war behind him.

11
00:00:24,305 --> 00:00:26,484
But who's to say
he wouldn't have wanted you

12
00:00:26,509 --> 00:00:28,242
to know his story?

13
00:00:35,312 --> 00:00:36,570
Hmm.

14
00:00:38,255 --> 00:00:40,623
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hey, Mom.

15
00:00:40,823 --> 00:00:42,500
The IVF worked.

16
00:00:43,425 --> 00:00:44,893
I'm pregnant.

17
00:00:44,927 --> 00:00:46,328
What?

18
00:00:48,773 --> 00:00:51,328
I can't believe it!

19
00:00:51,353 --> 00:00:53,718
My sister's having a baby. Beth!

20
00:00:53,743 --> 00:00:55,144
Get in here. It's Kate!

21
00:00:55,169 --> 00:00:57,637
We're getting another Pearson...

22
00:00:57,662 --> 00:00:59,164
Hell yeah.

23
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:01,042
- You guys deserve this.
- Yo!

24
00:01:01,067 --> 00:01:02,868
- Oh, my...
- Wait, put my man Tobias on the phone.

25
00:01:02,912 --> 00:01:04,279
I want to congratulate him, too.

26
00:01:05,734 --> 00:01:07,382
Toby is actually...

27
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:09,593
Depressed? About the baby?

28
00:01:09,618 --> 00:01:12,328
No, not about the baby.
He's thrilled about the baby.

29
00:01:12,867 --> 00:01:15,089
Apparently, he went off
his antidepressants

30
00:01:15,124 --> 00:01:18,179
in case the IVF didn't work and
they had to conceive naturally.

31
00:01:18,204 --> 00:01:19,771
Why doesn't he just get back on them?

32
00:01:19,796 --> 00:01:22,648
He did. He's been back on them
for two weeks now.

33
00:01:22,673 --> 00:01:24,937
It's just taking time
for them to kick back in.

34
00:01:24,962 --> 00:01:26,851
So how's Kate doing through it all?

35
00:01:26,876 --> 00:01:28,243
She's hanging in there.

36
00:01:28,898 --> 00:01:31,031
I just wish she wasn't so far away.

37
00:01:32,496 --> 00:01:33,963
Do you want me to come out there?

38
00:01:34,664 --> 00:01:37,000
Oh, that's really sweet, Kev, but...

39
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,770
there's not really anything you can do.

40
00:01:40,336 --> 00:01:42,109
Is Toby feeling any better?

41
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,242
Hi, honey.

42
00:01:53,816 --> 00:01:55,150
How are you feeling?

43
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:56,648
Oh, just tired.

44
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:00,868
I was, uh, gonna take Audio on a walk.

45
00:02:01,397 --> 00:02:03,778
Dr. Jasper said I should keep up
with the light exercise,

46
00:02:03,806 --> 00:02:05,460
so maybe we could all go together.

47
00:02:05,623 --> 00:02:07,023
If you're feeling up for it?

48
00:02:07,048 --> 00:02:09,046
Know what? You guys go ahead.

49
00:02:09,415 --> 00:02:10,812
There you go, buddy.

54
00:02:33,837 --> 00:02:35,117
Touchdown!

55
00:02:35,142 --> 00:02:37,505
That's five in a row for me,
you suckable sucker.

56
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:38,906
- What are you doing?
- How does it feel

57
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:40,609
- to be not very good at this?
- Mom!

58
00:02:40,634 --> 00:02:42,367
- Mom!
- How does it feel to lose?

59
00:02:42,392 --> 00:02:44,101
- Kevin, get off of me!
- No!

60
00:02:44,126 --> 00:02:47,061
Kevin, MVP of the world!

61
00:02:47,146 --> 00:02:48,796
Kevin, get off your brother. Come on.

62
00:02:48,906 --> 00:02:50,785
Come on, Mom. We're just messing around.

63
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:52,086
Oh, you're so annoying.

64
00:02:52,121 --> 00:02:54,187
- Hey.
- Hey. Hey, Pearsons.

65
00:02:54,212 --> 00:02:56,304
- Hey, babe.
- Hey, Dad.

66
00:02:56,329 --> 00:02:58,414
What's with the, uh, baseball hat?

67
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:01,359
Oh, you know, just, uh,
little hometown pride.

68
00:03:01,774 --> 00:03:03,484
- Um, Jack?
- Huh?

69
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:05,585
- You have a black eye.
- Yeah.

70
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:06,935
- What?
- I was...

71
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,709
boxing one of the guys at the gym

72
00:03:08,734 --> 00:03:10,881
and just caught a nasty punch. I'm fine.

73
00:03:10,906 --> 00:03:12,406
- You're a boxer?
- Um...

74
00:03:12,431 --> 00:03:13,781
Go set the table, please?

75
00:03:13,806 --> 00:03:15,774
- Go. Go, go, go, go, go. Come on.
- Come on.

76
00:03:17,813 --> 00:03:20,976
Jack, I knew you were using
the punching bag at the gym,

77
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:23,640
but since when did you start
boxing actual human beings?

78
00:03:23,665 --> 00:03:26,265
I don't do it that often,
just every once in a while,

79
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,320
me and some guys at the gym, we...

80
00:03:28,587 --> 00:03:31,296
spar a little bit. It's no big deal.

81
00:03:31,321 --> 00:03:33,617
Yeah, says my husband
with the black eye.

82
00:03:33,642 --> 00:03:35,570
You know, boxers can get brain damage.

83
00:03:35,595 --> 00:03:38,328
The guy that gave me this, that
tagged me, his name's Stuart.

84
00:03:38,575 --> 00:03:41,125
Okay? Guys named Stuart
don't give you brain damage.

85
00:03:41,174 --> 00:03:42,804
It's dangerous, babe.

86
00:03:43,202 --> 00:03:45,750
Promise me, punching bag only.

87
00:03:50,273 --> 00:03:51,515
I promise.

88
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:55,234
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

89
00:03:56,312 --> 00:03:59,593
Hi. This is Beth Pearson,
calling for Kellie.

90
00:03:59,992 --> 00:04:05,210
I was checking to see
if you got the résumé I sent in.

91
00:04:05,235 --> 00:04:07,905
You had asked me to send it last week,

92
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:11,984
but I hadn't heard anything,
so I thought I'd call.

93
00:04:12,334 --> 00:04:14,135
Uh, which is obvious,

94
00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:16,601
because you're getting
a voice-mail message from me.

95
00:04:16,637 --> 00:04:21,820
So if you could, uh, call me
back, that would be super-duper.

96
00:04:22,898 --> 00:04:24,242
God...

97
00:04:25,312 --> 00:04:27,617
Babe? I need help picking a shirt.

98
00:04:27,945 --> 00:04:29,242
Is it blue or white?

99
00:04:29,267 --> 00:04:30,562
- White.
- Blue.

100
00:04:30,835 --> 00:04:33,087
All right, so it's a draw
between Paul and John.

101
00:04:33,187 --> 00:04:34,695
- Ringo.
- Who's Paul and John?

102
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,954
The hell I'm Ringo.

103
00:04:36,165 --> 00:04:37,609
What happened to the teal?

104
00:04:37,634 --> 00:04:40,304
I thought teal... I don't know,
I was a little concerned

105
00:04:40,329 --> 00:04:42,039
it might make too much
of a statement for church.

106
00:04:42,064 --> 00:04:43,364
It's never too much of a statement

107
00:04:43,398 --> 00:04:45,281
- for black church, Randall.
- Black church.

108
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,632
Why are you going to church
in Philadelphia?

109
00:04:47,657 --> 00:04:49,421
Well, 'cause I'm running
for office in Philly,

110
00:04:49,446 --> 00:04:50,980
so I got to get my Philly on.

111
00:04:51,005 --> 00:04:53,016
Really connect with the people
in the community

112
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:54,408
that I want to represent.

113
00:04:54,443 --> 00:04:55,765
Maybe after church, I will

114
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:58,325
treat myself to an authentic
Philly cheesesteak.

115
00:04:58,436 --> 00:05:00,657
Load it up with Cheez Whiz
and everything.

116
00:05:00,682 --> 00:05:02,617
Cheez Whiz is gross.

117
00:05:02,651 --> 00:05:05,453
My beautiful darling gem of a daughter,

118
00:05:05,487 --> 00:05:07,789
if you ever say that within
Philadelphia city limits,

119
00:05:07,823 --> 00:05:09,320
I will be forced to disown you.

120
00:05:09,345 --> 00:05:12,046
Guys, can we talk about us now?

121
00:05:12,148 --> 00:05:13,761
- Okay.
- Sure, yeah.

122
00:05:14,218 --> 00:05:16,437
We're way behind
on Girl Scout cookie sales.

123
00:05:16,462 --> 00:05:20,432
Usually, we go to Mom's office
and sell at least 150 there,

124
00:05:20,882 --> 00:05:22,195
but, uh...

125
00:05:24,006 --> 00:05:26,073
Hey, um, how about tomorrow,

126
00:05:26,108 --> 00:05:27,679
when I have a little bit
more free time...

127
00:05:27,704 --> 00:05:29,828
No. It's fine.

128
00:05:29,947 --> 00:05:31,937
You have stuff to do. I don't.

129
00:05:32,306 --> 00:05:35,175
Uh, you know, we can set up
a table today to sell them.

130
00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:37,859
Right? We-we could make some posters.

131
00:05:37,884 --> 00:05:40,093
Why don't you guys go ask Deja
if she wants to join us?

132
00:05:44,682 --> 00:05:46,023
It's gonna be great.

133
00:05:47,529 --> 00:05:48,953
Great.

134
00:05:50,585 --> 00:05:52,700
Oh, Toby's still not feeling any better?

135
00:05:52,734 --> 00:05:54,898
No. Not really.

136
00:05:54,923 --> 00:05:58,706
But I don't know if I should be
pushing him to get out of bed,

137
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,054
or if I should just...
let him take his time.

138
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,593
I mean, what would you do?

139
00:06:03,618 --> 00:06:08,515
Uh, I think all you can do is
just be patient and supportive.

140
00:06:08,717 --> 00:06:11,285
But you need to be taking care
of yourself, too, Bug.

141
00:06:11,359 --> 00:06:12,843
Yeah, I know.

142
00:06:12,945 --> 00:06:15,437
I mean, I'm really
trying hard to stay chill.

143
00:06:15,937 --> 00:06:18,572
Audio! Mom, I got to go. I got to go.

144
00:06:18,684 --> 00:06:22,515
Audio. My God. Hey.
Hey, hey, let me see.

145
00:06:22,687 --> 00:06:24,699
What did you eat? What's in
your mouth? What did you...

146
00:06:24,733 --> 00:06:26,046
That doesn't look like food.

147
00:06:29,994 --> 00:06:31,703
I really wish I knew
what her name was, you know?

148
00:06:31,728 --> 00:06:33,953
Or anything about her, really.

149
00:06:33,978 --> 00:06:35,984
I mean, she's wearing my dad's necklace.

150
00:06:37,133 --> 00:06:38,507
You listening to me?

151
00:06:39,681 --> 00:06:41,328
Finito, completo.

152
00:06:41,353 --> 00:06:44,222
- What?
- My documentary is done.

153
00:06:44,247 --> 00:06:46,730
All that's left now is to not
obsessively check my e-mail

154
00:06:46,755 --> 00:06:48,171
while I wait to hear back
from the festivals.

155
00:06:48,196 --> 00:06:49,742
Are you kidding me?
Everyone's gonna want it.

156
00:06:49,767 --> 00:06:51,773
You got indie
darling written all over you.

157
00:06:51,867 --> 00:06:52,935
This is great news.

158
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,966
- Ooh, you know what we got to do?
- Hmm?

159
00:06:53,991 --> 00:06:56,234
We got to celebrate.
I've got an in at Le Bernardin.

160
00:06:56,259 --> 00:06:59,194
Just got to text Kimmel
real quick... as in Jimmy Kimmel.

161
00:06:59,656 --> 00:07:02,928
- Jimmy Kimmel, he's my in.
- Um, well, that's really sweet,

162
00:07:02,953 --> 00:07:04,405
but actually, I have this tradition,

163
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:06,908
that every time I finish
a project, I check into a hotel

164
00:07:06,942 --> 00:07:08,242
for a night of pampering.

165
00:07:08,267 --> 00:07:10,811
Get room service,
spend so long in a hot tub

166
00:07:10,846 --> 00:07:12,539
I turn into a full-on human raisin.

167
00:07:12,564 --> 00:07:13,764
- Human raisin?
- Yeah.

168
00:07:13,789 --> 00:07:14,960
I'm in. Let's do it.

169
00:07:14,985 --> 00:07:16,765
- Uh...
- Oh, gosh.

170
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:19,625
Um, how do I explain?

171
00:07:20,078 --> 00:07:21,281
I'm going alone.

172
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,390
You're going alone?

173
00:07:22,415 --> 00:07:23,554
- Yes.
- Why?

174
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:25,687
This tradition is about decompressing.

175
00:07:25,789 --> 00:07:28,218
I can't have your obsession
with that photo raining all over

176
00:07:28,243 --> 00:07:29,931
my 800-thread-count sheet parade.

177
00:07:29,965 --> 00:07:32,266
And, uh, seriously,

178
00:07:32,301 --> 00:07:34,296
stop thinking about the photo.

179
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:41,373
H-hey, Dad.

180
00:07:42,312 --> 00:07:44,304
I need you to teach me to box.

181
00:07:45,234 --> 00:07:47,109
Randall, you heard your mother.

182
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:48,898
There's no boxing in this house.

183
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,476
Dad, there's this kid at school.

184
00:07:51,501 --> 00:07:53,421
- Uh-huh.
- His name's Dylan.

185
00:07:53,446 --> 00:07:56,081
He just moved here from New
York, and he's picking on me.

186
00:07:56,504 --> 00:07:57,609
What?

187
00:07:57,634 --> 00:08:00,069
He pushes me into lockers
every time he gets a chance.

188
00:08:00,225 --> 00:08:01,559
Look, we got to tell your mother,

189
00:08:01,584 --> 00:08:02,885
and then we're gonna call your school.

190
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:04,632
We'll-we'll get it taken care of.

191
00:08:04,997 --> 00:08:07,832
Dad, everybody's gonna make fun
of me for being a snitch.

192
00:08:09,607 --> 00:08:12,320
I won't defend myself
unless I really have to.

193
00:08:13,355 --> 00:08:15,617
It'll just make me feel better
to know I can.

194
00:08:18,067 --> 00:08:19,737
♪ He's got, he's got the whole ♪

195
00:08:19,762 --> 00:08:21,838
♪ He's got the whole world
in his hands ♪

196
00:08:21,863 --> 00:08:24,213
- ♪ He's got the whole ♪
- ♪ He's got the whole world ♪

197
00:08:24,238 --> 00:08:26,432
- ♪ In his hands ♪
- ♪ Oh, he's got the whole ♪

198
00:08:26,475 --> 00:08:29,580
♪ He's got the whole world
in his hands ♪

199
00:08:29,605 --> 00:08:32,385
♪ Whole world in his hands. ♪

200
00:08:33,156 --> 00:08:35,567
- Somebody say amen.
- Amen.

201
00:08:35,683 --> 00:08:38,166
Welcome, friends, on this beautiful day

202
00:08:38,191 --> 00:08:39,884
- that God has given us.
- Yes.

203
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:41,518
- Yes.
- You may be seated.

204
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,323
Our brother Solomon is going
to read from scripture.

205
00:08:46,921 --> 00:08:49,112
Brother Solomon.

206
00:08:50,133 --> 00:08:51,471
Thank you, Rev.

207
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:55,134
Blessed day, my brothers and sisters.

208
00:08:56,351 --> 00:08:58,885
Before I share this good word,

209
00:08:59,642 --> 00:09:02,948
I want to make sure we give
a warm welcome to my friend

210
00:09:03,312 --> 00:09:04,679
and first-time visitor...

211
00:09:04,714 --> 00:09:06,768
- Oh, God, please don't.
- Randall Pearson.

212
00:09:07,902 --> 00:09:09,659
Stand up so we can greet you, brother.

213
00:09:12,493 --> 00:09:14,760
Randall is visiting us

214
00:09:14,785 --> 00:09:17,034
all the way from Alpine, New Jersey.

215
00:09:18,329 --> 00:09:19,510
Uh...

216
00:09:19,965 --> 00:09:21,284
Praise the Lord, everyone.

217
00:09:21,309 --> 00:09:22,971
Praise the Lord.

218
00:09:23,342 --> 00:09:28,346
Um, my family and I own
a building on Olney and Third.

219
00:09:28,591 --> 00:09:29,909
It's just a couple blocks away.

220
00:09:29,934 --> 00:09:32,041
So actually, we're very local.

221
00:09:32,455 --> 00:09:34,495
Well, why don't you have
that beautiful family of yours

222
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,666
stand up, too?

223
00:09:36,426 --> 00:09:38,424
Well, unfortunately, they
weren't able to be here today.

224
00:09:38,677 --> 00:09:41,560
- Oh. Maybe next time.
- Yeah.

225
00:09:41,585 --> 00:09:42,893
You know, Randall is the one

226
00:09:42,918 --> 00:09:44,698
running against me for city council.

227
00:09:45,222 --> 00:09:47,870
Now, you might think I wouldn't
welcome him here as a friend,

228
00:09:48,317 --> 00:09:51,463
but, well, he's trying
to do something good.

229
00:09:51,976 --> 00:09:53,768
He cares about people.

230
00:09:54,056 --> 00:09:56,229
And there's nothing wrong with that.

231
00:09:57,475 --> 00:09:58,791
So, Randall,

232
00:09:59,115 --> 00:10:01,854
we welcome you
to our humble neighborhood.

233
00:10:04,543 --> 00:10:05,885
Thank you, my friend.

234
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:08,166
And thank you all for having me.

235
00:10:09,232 --> 00:10:11,495
And now, I'll be
reading from the Book of Job,

236
00:10:12,101 --> 00:10:13,893
chapter 42.

237
00:10:15,411 --> 00:10:17,428
You're dragging my poster, Mom.

238
00:10:17,453 --> 00:10:20,096
- I'm sorry.
- Why did we park so far away?

239
00:10:20,165 --> 00:10:21,815
Well, because the parking lot was full.

240
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,651
Which is great news for
you guys, because busy store

241
00:10:24,676 --> 00:10:26,343
means lots of customers.

242
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:28,674
Oh, man.

243
00:10:29,178 --> 00:10:31,260
I-I told you we should've come earlier.

244
00:10:33,954 --> 00:10:37,284
Uh, you know what? It's okay.

245
00:10:37,551 --> 00:10:41,002
We'll just go somewhere else.
Right? Okay?

246
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:43,518
Okay, come on. Oh...

247
00:10:52,329 --> 00:10:53,432
Hey, Kev.

248
00:10:53,457 --> 00:10:55,877
Hey, uh, listen, you got some time?

249
00:10:55,902 --> 00:10:57,174
I need to talk to you about something.

250
00:10:57,199 --> 00:11:00,424
Actually, I'm in Philly
doing campaign stuff all day.

251
00:11:00,449 --> 00:11:02,916
- I can come to Philly.
- Please, do not come to Philly.

252
00:11:03,056 --> 00:11:05,174
Last thing I need is my white,
movie star brother

253
00:11:05,199 --> 00:11:06,833
coming and destroying what's left of my

254
00:11:06,858 --> 00:11:08,792
already precious-little street cred.

255
00:11:09,058 --> 00:11:10,713
Okay, listen, man, here's the thing.

256
00:11:10,738 --> 00:11:12,151
I know where your office is, okay,

257
00:11:12,176 --> 00:11:14,844
and you know that I don't
respect boundaries, so...

258
00:11:14,869 --> 00:11:17,518
I will... I'll text you
the address of a place

259
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:18,784
where we can meet.

260
00:11:18,809 --> 00:11:20,448
Cool. It's a date.

261
00:11:21,621 --> 00:11:23,799
Okay, bud, look.

262
00:11:24,492 --> 00:11:27,838
I made bacon, all rubbery,
just like you like it.

263
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:32,260
Oh, hi. What's up? How are you?

264
00:11:32,954 --> 00:11:35,729
I'm fine. What's wrong with Audio?

265
00:11:35,754 --> 00:11:37,151
- Audio?
- Audio...

266
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:40,479
Wait, is he...
is he not eating his bacon?

267
00:11:40,504 --> 00:11:42,049
Okay, please don't freak out.

268
00:11:42,426 --> 00:11:44,901
He may have swallowed
something bad at the dog park.

269
00:11:44,951 --> 00:11:47,479
- Why weren't you watching him?
- I was on the phone.

270
00:11:47,764 --> 00:11:49,159
I shouldn't have been on the phone.

271
00:11:49,678 --> 00:11:51,120
I will call the vet right now.

272
00:11:51,145 --> 00:11:53,112
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

273
00:11:55,789 --> 00:11:57,534
I didn't mean to make you feel bad.

274
00:11:59,747 --> 00:12:01,567
One... one-two.

275
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,018
Allright.

276
00:12:04,982 --> 00:12:07,083
You know, you got a lot of power
coming out of that left.

277
00:12:07,108 --> 00:12:09,856
You know what, try... sw-switch
up your feet so your...

278
00:12:09,881 --> 00:12:12,106
so your right foot is forward.
Okay? There you go.

279
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:13,622
Just like that. Same thing, okay?

280
00:12:13,769 --> 00:12:15,762
One-two. Jab, cross.

281
00:12:16,794 --> 00:12:18,215
One more. Jab, cross.

282
00:12:19,421 --> 00:12:21,262
- That feels good.
- Feels really good, right?

283
00:12:21,287 --> 00:12:24,153
Ladies and gents, we've got
a southpaw fighter on our hands.

284
00:12:24,178 --> 00:12:25,208
I'm a southpaw.

285
00:12:25,233 --> 00:12:26,661
- You're a southpaw.
- I'm a southpaw.

286
00:12:26,686 --> 00:12:28,231
All right, let's get
that southpaw in fighting shape.

287
00:12:28,256 --> 00:12:30,184
- Ready. One-two.
- Guys, I'm home.

288
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,083
Hi.

289
00:12:41,745 --> 00:12:43,114
How are you? It's me.

290
00:12:43,436 --> 00:12:44,942
How you doing? Enjoy yourself.

291
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,106
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

292
00:12:47,317 --> 00:12:48,650
- What is this place, huh?
- Ah.

293
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:49,985
This is where I bring my famous siblings

294
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,120
I can't be seen with.

295
00:12:51,154 --> 00:12:52,200
Ah.

296
00:12:54,426 --> 00:12:55,622
Wow.

297
00:12:55,992 --> 00:12:57,395
This is all...

298
00:12:58,551 --> 00:12:59,895
- a lot.
- Yeah.

299
00:13:00,934 --> 00:13:01,964
I mean, look at that.

300
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:03,973
Dad's obviously in love
with that woman, right?

301
00:13:03,998 --> 00:13:05,332
I don't know.

302
00:13:05,413 --> 00:13:08,067
I can't read her face. Is it love,

303
00:13:08,505 --> 00:13:10,439
or is it years of poverty

304
00:13:10,473 --> 00:13:12,307
and occupation by foreign governments?

305
00:13:12,661 --> 00:13:14,387
He gave me her necklace, right?

306
00:13:14,778 --> 00:13:16,011
That means something.

307
00:13:21,762 --> 00:13:22,973
Why now?

308
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,459
All of this.

309
00:13:27,836 --> 00:13:30,192
I don't... Do you remember, um...

310
00:13:31,461 --> 00:13:33,762
I don't know, we were,
like, maybe five years old.

311
00:13:33,797 --> 00:13:36,298
There was that-that guest room
that had the wallpaper

312
00:13:36,332 --> 00:13:38,267
with the little blue ships
on it; you remember that?

313
00:13:38,301 --> 00:13:39,435
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, okay.

314
00:13:39,469 --> 00:13:41,136
So, you and I were playing
in there one day,

315
00:13:41,171 --> 00:13:44,106
and we discovered this
little spot on the wallpaper

316
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,275
behind the sofa that was peeling, right?

317
00:13:46,309 --> 00:13:49,178
And-and so you and I, we sort of
peeled it a little more.

318
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:51,880
And then we kept peeling
just because we could.

319
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:53,315
And the next thing you know,
we had, like,

320
00:13:53,349 --> 00:13:55,997
half of the wallpaper was off the wall.
Do you remember that?

321
00:13:56,114 --> 00:13:58,120
I remember getting a particularly stern

322
00:13:58,154 --> 00:14:00,088
- talking-to from Mom about that.
- Yes.

323
00:14:00,123 --> 00:14:02,291
It-it just blew our little minds

324
00:14:02,325 --> 00:14:05,348
that there was wood paneling
behind the wallpaper.

325
00:14:05,373 --> 00:14:07,197
Like, it had never occurred to us

326
00:14:07,374 --> 00:14:10,009
that there was anything
beneath those ships.

327
00:14:15,371 --> 00:14:16,598
I started peeling.

328
00:14:20,288 --> 00:14:21,997
I'm curious about Dad, too.

329
00:14:24,825 --> 00:14:26,223
But Vietnam...

330
00:14:27,431 --> 00:14:29,966
that was a chapter in his life
he didn't want us to know about.

331
00:14:30,856 --> 00:14:32,794
He made that very clear
while he was still alive.

332
00:14:32,819 --> 00:14:33,950
I know.

333
00:14:37,894 --> 00:14:39,528
Yeah, you know, maybe you're right.

334
00:14:39,562 --> 00:14:41,296
You know, between the V.A. and Robinson,

335
00:14:41,331 --> 00:14:43,145
no one has any answers anyway, so...

336
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:46,768
Uh, sorry, man, we haven't ordered yet.

337
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:49,104
Oh. It's on the house.

338
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,340
- Kamsahamnida.
- Oh.

339
00:14:55,801 --> 00:14:57,079
You know what that is?

340
00:14:57,113 --> 00:14:58,778
- No idea.
- The Manny.

341
00:14:59,676 --> 00:15:01,504
Number-one show in South Korea.

342
00:15:02,012 --> 00:15:03,104
I kid you not.

343
00:15:03,129 --> 00:15:04,993
I think I got a K-pop song
named after me.

344
00:15:05,567 --> 00:15:07,395
I'm telling you, that's how
you know you've made it.

345
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,653
Big deal.

346
00:15:10,231 --> 00:15:12,661
Hey, you're free
for the rest of the day, right?

347
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,020
Wow, look at this, man.

348
00:15:15,045 --> 00:15:17,172
You got color-coded maps
and everything up in here,

349
00:15:17,206 --> 00:15:18,926
just like CNN. This is legit.

350
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,317
In the last municipal election

351
00:15:20,342 --> 00:15:22,333
held in this district, only 25%

352
00:15:22,358 --> 00:15:23,925
of registered voters voted.

353
00:15:24,231 --> 00:15:27,708
- 95% of those voted for Brown.
- Okay. So?

354
00:15:29,067 --> 00:15:31,528
About 50% of the Korean
population in this district

355
00:15:31,553 --> 00:15:33,294
aren't registered to vote at all.

356
00:15:33,387 --> 00:15:34,676
I repeat. Okay, so?

357
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:36,356
Okay, so...

358
00:15:36,716 --> 00:15:38,784
if I can't win over people
in this neighborhood,

359
00:15:38,818 --> 00:15:40,385
where Brown is already so ingrained,

360
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,722
then maybe we can appeal
to people in a neighborhood

361
00:15:42,747 --> 00:15:44,128
where he doesn't set foot at all.

362
00:15:44,153 --> 00:15:46,661
- We? As in the royal "we"?
- Yeah.

363
00:15:47,528 --> 00:15:49,112
You know, sometimes my heart is so big

364
00:15:49,137 --> 00:15:50,458
I can't even stand it.

365
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:53,106
- What's the game plan?
- I love you.

366
00:15:53,131 --> 00:15:54,528
- I know you do.
- I don't say it enough.

367
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:55,629
You don't say it enough.

368
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:57,655
- Hey, Mom.
- Hi, Bug.

369
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,794
How are you?

370
00:15:59,357 --> 00:16:00,465
Terrible.

371
00:16:01,397 --> 00:16:02,872
Audio ate a rock.

372
00:16:02,897 --> 00:16:04,192
What?

373
00:16:04,256 --> 00:16:05,645
The vet said that I have to decide

374
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:06,970
if we're gonna have surgery
to remove it,

375
00:16:06,995 --> 00:16:08,262
or if I should just take him home

376
00:16:08,287 --> 00:16:10,090
and see if he just... he poops it out.

377
00:16:10,146 --> 00:16:11,669
And if he doesn't poop it out,

378
00:16:11,694 --> 00:16:13,403
it could rupture his intestine.

379
00:16:13,428 --> 00:16:15,696
So it seems like both options
could kill him.

380
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:17,950
Tell me what to do, Mom.

381
00:16:19,419 --> 00:16:20,965
I...

382
00:16:21,434 --> 00:16:23,122
I think that you should take him home.

383
00:16:23,286 --> 00:16:25,497
You know, you'll feel more
in control that way.

384
00:16:25,522 --> 00:16:28,223
And then, if there's any
sign of distress,

385
00:16:28,248 --> 00:16:30,294
you can just take him
back in immediately.

386
00:16:31,911 --> 00:16:34,069
You know, if my maybe-baby
is a real baby,

387
00:16:34,103 --> 00:16:36,671
I'm gonna have to have you
move into our building.

388
00:16:38,036 --> 00:16:39,141
Mm.

389
00:16:39,175 --> 00:16:41,743
Bug, I love that you are
calling me for advice,

390
00:16:41,778 --> 00:16:45,286
and believe me,
I'm-I'm always happy to give it,

391
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:49,020
but can I let you in on a little secret?

392
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:54,379
Toby and Audio and your maybe-baby

393
00:16:54,404 --> 00:16:56,965
that I think is going to
turn into a real baby...

394
00:16:57,528 --> 00:17:00,950
There's gonna be a million
things, a million decisions

395
00:17:00,975 --> 00:17:03,122
you're gonna have to make
for them, and you will.

396
00:17:03,192 --> 00:17:05,536
You'll do exactly what I did.
You're gonna...

397
00:17:05,989 --> 00:17:09,559
take a deep breath...
and make a choice...

398
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:14,809
and just hope you didn't
screw things up too badly.

399
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:20,042
- Rebecca, let me explain.
- Okay. Help me out here, Jack.

400
00:17:20,067 --> 00:17:22,404
Help me out.
So, when I said "no boxing,"

401
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:25,333
what about that says, "I should
teach Randall how to box"?

402
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:27,770
You know, he's getting
bullied at school.

403
00:17:28,317 --> 00:17:29,478
- What?
- Yeah.

404
00:17:29,512 --> 00:17:31,013
Some new kid is picking on him,

405
00:17:31,047 --> 00:17:32,848
and he's worried that things
are gonna get physical.

406
00:17:32,882 --> 00:17:34,817
But he doesn't want us
to make a big deal about it

407
00:17:34,851 --> 00:17:37,119
because he thinks, and I agree,

408
00:17:37,153 --> 00:17:38,854
that's just gonna make things worse.

409
00:17:38,888 --> 00:17:41,290
He's 12. You can't
blindly follow the wishes

410
00:17:41,324 --> 00:17:42,591
of a 12-year-old.

411
00:17:42,626 --> 00:17:44,326
Especially when it comes to his safety.

412
00:17:44,361 --> 00:17:46,462
Jack, if you feel the need
to go secretly

413
00:17:46,496 --> 00:17:48,263
punch some guys as a stress reliever

414
00:17:48,298 --> 00:17:51,033
for all the things you don't
talk about, that's one thing.

415
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:53,002
But you cannot keep things from me

416
00:17:53,036 --> 00:17:54,450
when they're about our sons.

417
00:17:57,277 --> 00:17:58,477
You're right. I'm sorry.

418
00:17:58,753 --> 00:18:00,840
We need to call his principal.

419
00:18:04,614 --> 00:18:05,989
No one's here.

420
00:18:06,316 --> 00:18:07,497
Of course not.

421
00:18:07,522 --> 00:18:09,585
Almost all these stores are
out of business.

422
00:18:09,801 --> 00:18:11,320
Oh, there's someone.

423
00:18:11,354 --> 00:18:12,488
- Hi.
- Hi.

424
00:18:12,522 --> 00:18:14,490
Would you like to buy
some Girl Scout cookies?

425
00:18:14,524 --> 00:18:17,192
My daughters used to sell these
a million years ago.

426
00:18:17,227 --> 00:18:18,961
Let me see, um...

427
00:18:18,995 --> 00:18:20,739
I'll take four boxes of the shortbread.

428
00:18:20,764 --> 00:18:22,481
That'll be $16, please.

429
00:18:23,092 --> 00:18:24,747
Oh, I'm sorry. Cash only.

430
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:26,137
No, we're not.

431
00:18:26,162 --> 00:18:27,703
We just need to use the swiper.

432
00:18:27,737 --> 00:18:28,771
The what, now?

433
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,934
You didn't bring the swiper?

434
00:18:31,356 --> 00:18:33,542
What is the swiper?

435
00:18:33,576 --> 00:18:34,810
The little thing that you put

436
00:18:34,844 --> 00:18:36,401
on your phone and swipe credit cards?

437
00:18:36,426 --> 00:18:37,846
Everyone knows you need a swiper.

438
00:18:37,881 --> 00:18:40,067
I'm sorry, I don't have any cash on me.

439
00:18:40,317 --> 00:18:41,622
Uh, we can...

440
00:18:41,786 --> 00:18:44,086
You know what, you can
give us your credit card number,

441
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,155
and we'll just write it down
on a piece of paper

442
00:18:46,189 --> 00:18:47,723
and tear it up right after we run it.

443
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,333
Um, I don't think so.

444
00:18:50,627 --> 00:18:51,817
Good luck.

445
00:18:52,429 --> 00:18:54,029
Thanks a lot, Mom.

446
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:55,770
I wish we went with Riley.

447
00:18:55,879 --> 00:18:58,526
She texted that they've already
sold 40 boxes today.

448
00:18:58,551 --> 00:19:00,335
All right, I'm doing my best here, okay?

449
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:02,425
I'm sorry I'm not as good
as Riley's mom.

450
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:03,772
Yeah. Me, too.

451
00:19:04,387 --> 00:19:06,512
Riley's mom would have
never forgotten the swiper,

452
00:19:06,754 --> 00:19:08,272
because she doesn't totally suck.

453
00:19:08,297 --> 00:19:09,911
Shut up, shut up, shut up!

454
00:19:15,949 --> 00:19:17,383
Come on, let's go.

455
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:20,848
Come on!

456
00:19:22,544 --> 00:19:25,379
Okay, thank you so much,
Principal Sammartino.

457
00:19:26,169 --> 00:19:27,958
Okay, bye-bye.

458
00:19:28,075 --> 00:19:30,317
- What? What'd he say?
- Um...

459
00:19:30,614 --> 00:19:32,975
there is no one named Dylan
in his class,

460
00:19:33,009 --> 00:19:35,520
and there are no new students
from New York at all.

461
00:19:35,545 --> 00:19:37,364
Wait, that doesn't make any sense.

462
00:19:37,389 --> 00:19:39,156
Why would he make up a bully?

463
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:41,059
I have no idea.

464
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:44,848
- But we have to go talk to him.
- You know what, Bec?

465
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,156
Let me talk to him.
No, let me talk to him.

466
00:19:48,191 --> 00:19:50,684
My-my son lied to me.
I need to find out why.

467
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:53,379
Okay.

468
00:19:53,743 --> 00:19:55,578
- Hey, Bec?
- Huh?

469
00:19:57,772 --> 00:19:59,434
The reason I...

470
00:20:02,318 --> 00:20:04,106
Boxing helps me.

471
00:20:05,395 --> 00:20:06,637
Okay? It...

472
00:20:08,442 --> 00:20:10,489
...helps me with stuff.

473
00:20:11,532 --> 00:20:13,778
Stuff I can't think about.

474
00:20:15,051 --> 00:20:18,551
It... quiets things.

475
00:20:20,423 --> 00:20:21,926
I wish I could explain it.

476
00:20:22,113 --> 00:20:23,864
I don't know any other...

477
00:20:49,254 --> 00:20:50,903
Okay. Okay.

478
00:21:12,895 --> 00:21:16,450
My mom lost a lot of jobs
through the years.

479
00:21:17,046 --> 00:21:18,934
It was always really hard for her.

480
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:22,075
You know, I was just about
to come talk to you guys.

481
00:21:22,518 --> 00:21:24,696
I am sorry about earlier,

482
00:21:25,308 --> 00:21:27,481
but you really don't
have to worry about me.

483
00:21:30,026 --> 00:21:32,176
You know what Randall told me one time?

484
00:21:33,685 --> 00:21:35,419
He called me exceptional.

485
00:21:36,075 --> 00:21:39,551
And he said it so easy,
like it wasn't a big deal.

486
00:21:39,805 --> 00:21:41,254
I remember thinking,

487
00:21:41,803 --> 00:21:44,338
he must think people have
told me this before.

488
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:51,114
I bet he's told you before
that you're exceptional,

489
00:21:51,464 --> 00:21:53,114
because you are.

490
00:21:54,801 --> 00:21:56,018
Thanks, Dej.

491
00:21:56,169 --> 00:21:57,762
You know, but I don't know that...

492
00:21:57,787 --> 00:21:59,426
Randall thinks so.

493
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:04,402
I mean, he loves you like he's
in a Disney movie or something,

494
00:22:04,427 --> 00:22:08,163
like he hears tiny
forest animals singing

495
00:22:08,197 --> 00:22:11,465
or playing kazoos or something
whenever you walk into a room.

496
00:22:13,052 --> 00:22:14,715
But if you're sad,

497
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,708
then you should talk to him.

498
00:22:19,342 --> 00:22:21,473
He'll tell you you're exceptional,

499
00:22:22,155 --> 00:22:25,153
and he'll say it so easy

500
00:22:25,414 --> 00:22:26,864
that you'll believe it.

501
00:22:29,731 --> 00:22:30,958
Wow.

502
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:34,451
You are really good at these talks.

503
00:22:34,817 --> 00:22:36,497
You live in this house for a while,

504
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:38,348
you learn your way around a talk.

505
00:22:44,099 --> 00:22:46,239
Oh, come on in, little mamas.

506
00:22:46,283 --> 00:22:48,218
Come on. Everything's okay.

507
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:53,346
I'm so sorry that I exploded.

508
00:22:54,223 --> 00:22:55,231
Okay?

509
00:22:55,256 --> 00:22:57,294
It was not about you.

510
00:22:57,583 --> 00:23:00,782
- No. I was being a brat.
- Okay.

511
00:23:00,817 --> 00:23:03,085
It was ten percent about you.

512
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:04,747
90% not.

513
00:23:08,162 --> 00:23:09,536
You got it?

514
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:12,691
There you go. That's a good one.

515
00:23:12,716 --> 00:23:14,262
Register to vote, it'll last longer.

516
00:23:14,287 --> 00:23:17,122
Okay, you're all set, Mrs. Park.

517
00:23:17,449 --> 00:23:19,528
Hope to see you at the polls. Thank you.

518
00:23:20,754 --> 00:23:22,450
Hey, how you doing, sir?
Randall Pearson.

519
00:23:22,475 --> 00:23:24,786
Hey. Let me see if I have this.

520
00:23:24,967 --> 00:23:28,470
Um, you can't make any inroads
with Sol Brown's base,

521
00:23:28,598 --> 00:23:30,588
so you're getting Koreans to register,

522
00:23:30,613 --> 00:23:32,214
hoping that they'll vote for you

523
00:23:32,248 --> 00:23:34,270
'cause you're related to The Baby-Man.

524
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:36,047
I'm sorry, The Baby-Man?

525
00:23:36,575 --> 00:23:38,997
Yeah, it's what they call
The Manny in South Korea.

526
00:23:39,022 --> 00:23:40,997
Dude, you are so transparent.

527
00:23:41,122 --> 00:23:42,887
I bet you've never
stepped foot here before,

528
00:23:42,912 --> 00:23:44,379
and if you get elected... if...

529
00:23:44,688 --> 00:23:46,169
you'll never step foot here again.

530
00:23:54,078 --> 00:23:55,215
Hey.

531
00:23:56,278 --> 00:23:57,403
You're right.

532
00:23:57,942 --> 00:23:59,333
You're right, man, I-I've never been

533
00:23:59,358 --> 00:24:02,629
in this neighborhood before,
but I'm here now.

534
00:24:07,286 --> 00:24:10,372
But just on the way in here,
I saw empty storefronts.

535
00:24:13,365 --> 00:24:15,512
I saw badly patched potholes.

536
00:24:17,294 --> 00:24:20,075
I saw a guy carrying his
bicycle tire underneath his arms

537
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,419
because he knew that was the only way

538
00:24:21,444 --> 00:24:22,811
to keep from getting it stolen.

539
00:24:27,434 --> 00:24:30,247
But I don't know what
this community truly wants...

540
00:24:33,648 --> 00:24:35,015
...or truly needs.

541
00:24:37,021 --> 00:24:40,598
But if you'll talk to me, I'll listen.

542
00:24:43,801 --> 00:24:45,320
As long as your kick-ass sister

543
00:24:45,354 --> 00:24:46,855
keeps interpreting for me, that is.

544
00:24:50,326 --> 00:24:54,169
I, uh, I only know one word
in Korean so far.

545
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:57,770
My brother taught it to me.

546
00:25:01,997 --> 00:25:03,379
Kamsahamnida.

547
00:25:06,833 --> 00:25:08,109
Did I say that right?

548
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:20,278
- Hey, how's he doing?
- Hey, oh, he's okay.

549
00:25:20,737 --> 00:25:22,731
Just swallowed a little rock.

550
00:25:24,544 --> 00:25:26,311
Just gonna monitor him, and, uh,

551
00:25:26,611 --> 00:25:28,622
he'll be fine as long as he poops.

552
00:25:32,059 --> 00:25:33,434
You got dressed.

553
00:25:34,239 --> 00:25:36,395
You felt good enough to get dressed.
That's huge.

554
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,887
Uh, except that I don't.

555
00:25:39,356 --> 00:25:41,848
- What?
- I-I don't.

556
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:45,847
I want to, and I-I-I thought
if I went through the motions

557
00:25:45,881 --> 00:25:47,911
that I would, but I don't.

558
00:25:48,364 --> 00:25:50,218
- I'm starting to get worried.
- About what?

559
00:25:50,252 --> 00:25:51,786
That you're gonna leave me.

560
00:25:52,536 --> 00:25:54,582
Not now, but eventually.

561
00:25:54,607 --> 00:25:56,308
Toby, what are you talking about?

562
00:25:56,342 --> 00:25:57,709
You didn't sign up for this.

563
00:25:57,743 --> 00:25:59,044
And you're pregnant.

564
00:25:59,078 --> 00:26:01,129
I'm the one who's supposed
to be taking care of you,

565
00:26:01,154 --> 00:26:03,425
and instead I'm this pathetic burden.

566
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:04,750
You must be freaking out

567
00:26:04,785 --> 00:26:06,442
that this is what you're stuck with.

568
00:26:07,006 --> 00:26:09,965
Look, I tried
my very hardest today, and...

569
00:26:13,556 --> 00:26:14,778
I'm sorry.

570
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:19,419
Tobe!

571
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:21,012
Toby, I think he wants to go out.

572
00:26:21,235 --> 00:26:23,184
I'm gonna take him out. Come with us?

573
00:26:25,873 --> 00:26:27,040
No.

574
00:26:31,459 --> 00:26:32,544
Toby.

575
00:26:35,002 --> 00:26:36,965
I think you should go on a walk with us.

576
00:26:43,198 --> 00:26:44,411
Okay.

577
00:26:49,412 --> 00:26:50,590
Oh, yeah.

578
00:26:52,786 --> 00:26:54,726
Thanks, Kev. Appreciate it, man.

579
00:26:54,751 --> 00:26:57,269
Yeah, man, these muscles
aren't just for show.

580
00:26:57,304 --> 00:26:58,653
Actually, that's not true at all.

581
00:26:58,678 --> 00:27:00,059
They're mostly just for show.

582
00:27:02,708 --> 00:27:04,606
You know, Randall, you wanted
to find your birth dad,

583
00:27:04,631 --> 00:27:07,300
and you found him,
which led you to his building,

584
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:11,309
which you bought, which led you
to run for city council.

585
00:27:12,754 --> 00:27:14,419
You want to do something,
you just do it.

586
00:27:14,444 --> 00:27:15,700
Right, you don't... you don't care if it

587
00:27:15,725 --> 00:27:17,465
makes sense to any of us or not. It's...

588
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:20,395
It's remarkable.

589
00:27:21,926 --> 00:27:24,497
When you have one of those things
inside you, you just go for it.

590
00:27:26,877 --> 00:27:29,379
- Yeah, I guess I do.
- I guess you do.

591
00:27:33,741 --> 00:27:35,770
Randall, I've got one
of those things inside me.

592
00:27:36,882 --> 00:27:38,965
About Dad. I can't let it go.

593
00:27:41,575 --> 00:27:42,794
You need to peel the wallpaper.

594
00:27:42,819 --> 00:27:44,386
I need to peel the wallpaper.

595
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,684
I hope you find what
you're looking for, brother.

596
00:27:59,012 --> 00:28:01,020
Is Mom really mad about the boxing?

597
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:02,403
No.

598
00:28:02,699 --> 00:28:07,098
She's not so mad,
but we are both confused.

599
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:11,911
We spoke to your principal, Randall.

600
00:28:11,945 --> 00:28:13,546
We know there is no Dylan.

601
00:28:15,156 --> 00:28:16,890
Yeah. So you...

602
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:18,715
you lied to me.

603
00:28:23,056 --> 00:28:24,669
I wanted you to teach me how to box,

604
00:28:24,694 --> 00:28:26,801
but I knew you wouldn't
if I didn't have a good reason.

605
00:28:26,826 --> 00:28:29,309
Okay, so you made up a fake bully?

606
00:28:31,765 --> 00:28:33,559
Why did you want to learn so bad?

607
00:28:34,745 --> 00:28:36,301
So I could be more like you.

608
00:28:37,346 --> 00:28:38,706
Randall,

609
00:28:38,829 --> 00:28:42,583
boxing is just one part of me.

610
00:28:43,365 --> 00:28:45,176
Yeah, that Kevin has.

611
00:28:46,669 --> 00:28:47,848
What do you mean by that?

612
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:50,504
Kevin's good at fighting, Dad,
and he wins everything.

613
00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:52,919
Wait, hold on a second, so you
wanted to learn how to box

614
00:28:52,944 --> 00:28:55,059
- so that you could fight your brother?
- No.

615
00:28:57,007 --> 00:28:59,176
Kevin's tough, and he got that from you,

616
00:28:59,246 --> 00:29:00,481
and I didn't.

617
00:29:00,616 --> 00:29:02,145
Dad, the thing is

618
00:29:03,514 --> 00:29:07,575
that I know I'm your son,
but Kevin is your...

619
00:29:08,083 --> 00:29:09,364
son-son,

620
00:29:11,805 --> 00:29:14,028
and he got DNA stuff
from you that I didn't.

621
00:29:14,864 --> 00:29:16,325
You need to teach me.

622
00:29:16,465 --> 00:29:18,403
I need to learn how
to become a fighter, Dad,

623
00:29:18,428 --> 00:29:19,794
if I'm gonna get anywhere in life.

624
00:29:19,819 --> 00:29:21,254
- No, you don't.
- No, Dad, I just...

625
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,122
No, Randall, no, you don't.

626
00:29:26,426 --> 00:29:28,872
Look, first of all,

627
00:29:29,689 --> 00:29:31,919
you are my son-son.

628
00:29:32,705 --> 00:29:34,840
Okay? And second...

629
00:29:36,897 --> 00:29:38,653
...you've got something even greater

630
00:29:38,678 --> 00:29:40,458
than knowing how to throw a punch.

631
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,473
You-you've got a brain

632
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:47,341
so smart that you tricked your old man

633
00:29:47,366 --> 00:29:50,309
into thinking that I
had to teach you how to fight.

634
00:29:50,811 --> 00:29:51,911
And that...

635
00:29:53,568 --> 00:29:56,450
is gonna be your
secret weapon, Southpaw.

636
00:30:06,474 --> 00:30:08,520
So, uh, how many voters you register?

637
00:30:09,019 --> 00:30:10,231
About 200.

638
00:30:10,306 --> 00:30:14,109
Ah, well, you only need
around, uh, 20,000 more.

639
00:30:14,308 --> 00:30:15,926
Well, you got to start somewhere.

640
00:30:19,153 --> 00:30:21,090
You know, my grandmother
has spent the last few hours

641
00:30:21,115 --> 00:30:23,325
talking about the black man
with nice hands.

642
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:26,137
She's got a thing about hands.

643
00:30:26,504 --> 00:30:29,840
Well, tell her thanks.
I, uh... I moisturize.

644
00:30:32,801 --> 00:30:35,458
My grandmother has never voted
once in her life.

645
00:30:36,465 --> 00:30:38,395
In Korea, she didn't
really have the access,

646
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,755
and when she became a citizen over here,

647
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,915
it was always clear to her
that no politician cares

648
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:46,075
what an old woman from a little
village north of Seoul wants.

649
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:50,411
But today, she registered to vote,

650
00:30:51,614 --> 00:30:55,161
for the first time in 75 years,

651
00:30:56,393 --> 00:30:58,637
because you made her believe
that you care.

652
00:31:00,061 --> 00:31:01,778
And, plus, the nice hands.

653
00:31:03,177 --> 00:31:04,419
I do care.

654
00:31:07,551 --> 00:31:09,200
I have a master's in poli-sci,

655
00:31:09,225 --> 00:31:11,192
and I was an aide
in a congressional campaign

656
00:31:11,217 --> 00:31:13,278
in Ohio's 13th in 2016.

657
00:31:14,111 --> 00:31:15,989
I know you don't have
a campaign manager.

658
00:31:17,506 --> 00:31:18,950
I want the gig.

659
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:24,214
I'm sorry, I didn't get
your name earlier.

660
00:31:24,404 --> 00:31:27,661
Jae-won, but most non-Koreans
call me John.

661
00:31:31,208 --> 00:31:33,919
Me and my nice hands are happy
to have you on board, Jae-won.

662
00:31:38,045 --> 00:31:39,137
Okay. All right.

663
00:31:39,162 --> 00:31:40,144
Oh, is that how you do it?

664
00:31:40,169 --> 00:31:41,886
- Kamsahamnida.
- That's good.

665
00:31:41,911 --> 00:31:44,495
- Kamsahamnida. Kamsahamnida.
- That's how you pronounce it. Yeah.

666
00:31:45,417 --> 00:31:47,182
You know, I'm still thinking about it.

667
00:31:48,027 --> 00:31:52,415
You know, I go in there wanting
to ground him for lying to me,

668
00:31:52,972 --> 00:31:53,973
and then when I left,

669
00:31:54,008 --> 00:31:56,151
I wanted to hug him tighter
than humanly possible.

670
00:31:56,292 --> 00:31:57,792
I just...

671
00:31:58,597 --> 00:32:00,713
I can't get my head
around that kid sometimes.

672
00:32:00,748 --> 00:32:01,862
Yeah.

673
00:32:03,378 --> 00:32:04,753
Speaking of heads.

674
00:32:05,034 --> 00:32:06,378
What's that?

675
00:32:07,167 --> 00:32:09,987
I got you this today.

676
00:32:10,866 --> 00:32:13,214
Just a little something, not a big deal.

677
00:32:18,253 --> 00:32:19,499
Is this a test?

678
00:32:19,533 --> 00:32:21,017
It's headgear.

679
00:32:21,042 --> 00:32:22,761
Yeah, I know it's headgear.

680
00:32:22,786 --> 00:32:24,804
If boxing is important to you,

681
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:28,128
I just want you to be safe, okay?

682
00:32:37,775 --> 00:32:39,876
You know, my brother and I,
we used to box?

683
00:32:42,682 --> 00:32:43,886
Yeah.

684
00:32:44,111 --> 00:32:48,300
There was this local, ancient
boxer in our neighborhood.

685
00:32:48,325 --> 00:32:51,627
Steve Bihuniak, "The Squid."

686
00:32:52,854 --> 00:32:55,106
He had this old pair
of boxing mitts that...

687
00:32:55,131 --> 00:32:58,034
we used to go over there and
we'd each put one of them on.

688
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:03,805
And-and then we'd roll toilet paper up

689
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:06,374
and-and stuff it in our teeth
like they were mouth guards,

690
00:33:06,573 --> 00:33:09,370
and, you know, we'd have
these one-handed boxing matches.

691
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:14,112
Wow.

692
00:33:16,172 --> 00:33:17,354
These are great.

693
00:33:19,156 --> 00:33:21,722
All right, you win.

694
00:33:22,388 --> 00:33:23,636
Win what?

695
00:33:24,101 --> 00:33:25,393
Teach me how to box.

696
00:33:25,861 --> 00:33:28,386
- You want to learn how to box?
- If everybody else knows how.

697
00:33:29,952 --> 00:33:32,175
- Here. Put that on.
- I'm not...

698
00:33:32,508 --> 00:33:34,917
- not wearing this.
- You got to protect your head.

699
00:33:35,161 --> 00:33:36,753
Just put on the gloves.

700
00:33:37,638 --> 00:33:39,112
Here. There's one...

701
00:33:39,137 --> 00:33:40,526
- Uh-huh.
- In there tight. Okay.

702
00:33:40,551 --> 00:33:42,418
- Yeah. Okay.
- Hold on a sec.

703
00:33:43,745 --> 00:33:45,823
Put this second one on...
just, like, push it down.

704
00:33:45,848 --> 00:33:47,534
- There you go. Okay.
- Okay.

705
00:33:48,058 --> 00:33:49,198
Now get them up.

706
00:33:49,747 --> 00:33:51,245
- Is this what I do?
- Oh, wow.

707
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:53,964
I mean, you in a nightgown
with boxing gloves on,

708
00:33:53,989 --> 00:33:55,128
I mean, that was a fantasy

709
00:33:55,153 --> 00:33:56,307
I didn't even know that I was missing.

710
00:33:56,332 --> 00:33:58,925
Shut up, Jack. How do I do this?

711
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:00,520
All right, send us one past here.

712
00:34:00,545 --> 00:34:01,948
- Yeah.
- Oof. Throw the other one.

713
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:04,206
Oh. Yeah.

714
00:34:04,724 --> 00:34:06,628
- Hi.
- That's not so bad.

715
00:34:09,305 --> 00:34:10,581
Thank you.

716
00:34:10,773 --> 00:34:12,143
Yeah. Of course.

717
00:34:12,843 --> 00:34:15,237
Yes, I have the budget proposal
right here.

718
00:34:17,716 --> 00:34:19,495
Mary, let me call you back.

719
00:34:22,084 --> 00:34:23,307
Randall.

720
00:34:23,705 --> 00:34:24,925
Pleasant surprise.

721
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:27,026
You're good.

722
00:34:28,636 --> 00:34:30,603
At church today, you were gracious,

723
00:34:30,628 --> 00:34:33,261
but you made it very clear
you don't think I belong.

724
00:34:34,146 --> 00:34:35,206
Well played.

725
00:34:35,452 --> 00:34:37,086
Come on, slip, slip, slip.

726
00:34:37,294 --> 00:34:39,432
- Ooh!
- Did you see that?

727
00:34:39,457 --> 00:34:42,167
He gets hit square in the jaw,
spits out blood,

728
00:34:42,192 --> 00:34:43,979
and what does he do? He smiles.

729
00:34:44,004 --> 00:34:45,378
Why would he do that?

730
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:49,909
Well, uh, I've been at this a while.

731
00:34:51,046 --> 00:34:54,167
Yeah, well, I'm still learning.

732
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:56,628
He doesn't want his
opponent to know that he's hurt.

733
00:34:56,949 --> 00:34:59,117
There's this thing
that some fighters do.

734
00:34:59,268 --> 00:35:01,870
Okay? If their opponent
hits them really hard,

735
00:35:02,045 --> 00:35:04,513
they just plaster on a big old smile.

736
00:35:06,945 --> 00:35:09,089
Go. Stay on him, stay on him. Go.

737
00:35:09,114 --> 00:35:11,065
I did get a campaign manager.

738
00:35:12,429 --> 00:35:14,253
His name is Jae-won Yoo.

739
00:35:17,167 --> 00:35:18,878
I'm going to win Koreatown.

740
00:35:27,813 --> 00:35:29,292
- Tobe?
- Yeah?

741
00:35:29,841 --> 00:35:31,354
I'm not gonna leave you.

742
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:33,182
What?

743
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:34,706
I signed up for better or worse.

744
00:35:34,731 --> 00:35:36,566
Yeah, no, I know. It-it...

745
00:35:36,871 --> 00:35:38,534
It's just that you don't...
you don't how long...

746
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:42,589
Like, this is gonna be a part
of me for my entire life,

747
00:35:42,614 --> 00:35:43,831
so it's...

748
00:35:44,558 --> 00:35:45,698
Go on.

749
00:35:45,723 --> 00:35:49,326
Babe, better or worse.

750
00:35:52,495 --> 00:35:53,768
Ever since I was a little girl,

751
00:35:53,793 --> 00:35:56,161
I have needed to be taken care of.

752
00:35:57,026 --> 00:35:58,526
First, when I was a little chubby kid,

753
00:35:58,551 --> 00:35:59,800
I needed to be coddled.

754
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:02,706
And then as a teenager whose dad died,

755
00:36:02,731 --> 00:36:04,518
I needed to be comforted all the time.

756
00:36:05,186 --> 00:36:07,612
I'm 38 years old, and I still
call my mom for advice

757
00:36:07,857 --> 00:36:10,870
when I'm going through
a rough spot, and-and you...

758
00:36:11,571 --> 00:36:14,784
wow, you have talked me off
of more emotional ledges

759
00:36:14,809 --> 00:36:16,243
than I can count.

760
00:36:18,268 --> 00:36:19,886
But the truth is I'm strong.

761
00:36:20,274 --> 00:36:22,175
And the things that I've been through

762
00:36:22,667 --> 00:36:24,729
have made me tough as hell.

763
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:28,511
So if you think this
is gonna scare me away,

764
00:36:28,536 --> 00:36:29,964
you've got another thing coming.

765
00:36:31,083 --> 00:36:32,964
I'm gonna get you through this, Tobe.

766
00:36:35,478 --> 00:36:40,753
And if you fall again, I will be
right here to pick you back up.

767
00:36:43,235 --> 00:36:45,803
In sickness and health,
for better, for worse.

768
00:36:46,095 --> 00:36:47,651
I'm talking forever.

00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,023
Hi.

777
00:37:19,884 --> 00:37:21,425
- One night, Kevin.
- I know.

778
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:23,570
- I asked for one night.
- I know, I know, I know, I know.

779
00:37:23,595 --> 00:37:25,698
I know you did, and I'm sorry
to interrupt your raisining,

00:37:25,723 --> 00:37:27,224
really, I am, and as penance,

781
00:37:27,249 --> 00:37:29,217
I promise I'm finally
gonna sit down with you

782
00:37:29,328 --> 00:37:31,003
and I'm gonna watch
that documentary Planet Earth,

783
00:37:31,028 --> 00:37:33,129
the one that you can't stop
talking about.

784
00:37:33,765 --> 00:37:35,370
But I really need to talk to you.

00:37:36,708 --> 00:37:37,925
Go on.

786
00:37:40,149 --> 00:37:41,346
Okay, uh...

787
00:37:42,826 --> 00:37:44,089
I-I never...

788
00:37:44,158 --> 00:37:47,807
I never really knew
how to ask my dad... things.

789
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:50,479
Or-or what to ask him, even.

790
00:37:51,794 --> 00:37:54,964
And, um, well, here.

What is this?

792
00:37:57,598 --> 00:37:59,733
Why do people always ask that?
If you open it up,

793
00:37:59,758 --> 00:38:01,175
then you'll know what it is.

794
00:38:13,882 --> 00:38:18,018
That is a visa application
for a trip to Vietnam.

795
00:38:20,654 --> 00:38:22,417
I need to go there, Zoe.

796
00:38:23,198 --> 00:38:25,003
I'm gonna go to the place
where my dad last served,

797
00:38:25,028 --> 00:38:26,151
I'm gonna track down that woman,

798
00:38:26,176 --> 00:38:27,682
and I'm gonna figure out my dad's story.

799
00:38:27,707 --> 00:38:30,376
And I-I know it sounds absolutely crazy,

800
00:38:30,401 --> 00:38:32,643
and it's probably even crazier
that I'm asking you to come with me

801
00:38:32,668 --> 00:38:33,925
because our relationship is brand-new,

802
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:36,206
and it's fresh and it's fun
and 14 hours on a plane

803
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:39,112
and sharing a hotel room and a
bathroom with no air freshener,

804
00:38:39,137 --> 00:38:40,437
just gross.

805
00:38:41,176 --> 00:38:42,612

806
00:38:42,637 --> 00:38:44,456
the documentarian in you
would dig it, you know?

00:38:44,481 --> 00:38:46,284
Or maybe the part of you
that digs me would dig it.

808
00:38:46,309 --> 00:38:48,464

like I'm talking way too much,
