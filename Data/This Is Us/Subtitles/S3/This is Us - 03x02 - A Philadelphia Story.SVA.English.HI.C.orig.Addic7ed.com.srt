00:09:01,304 --> 00:09:04,985
Listen, all of this is big news,
and it's still early.

175
00:09:05,085 --> 00:09:07,170
And I-I don't want to talk about risks

176
00:09:07,195 --> 00:09:08,555
or hormone shots with my mom,

177
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,568
so let's not say anything to my family.

178
00:09:10,593 --> 00:09:11,718
Yeah, I guess you're right.

179
00:09:11,743 --> 00:09:15,046
Some things are best kept
between a husband and his wife

180
00:09:15,804 --> 00:09:17,250
and his Lyft driver.

181
00:09:17,546 --> 00:09:19,343
Really hope the IVF works for you guys.

182
00:09:19,368 --> 00:09:21,269
- Okay, thanks.
- Thanks.

184
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:43,550
Looks like you could use a hand.

185
00:09:44,038 --> 00:09:45,585
Thank you. I can manage.

186
00:09:46,059 --> 00:09:47,304
Fair enough.

187
00:09:49,051 --> 00:09:51,343
Please, do not touch my things.
I said I can manage.

190
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:01,182
Hey, Randall. Is everything okay?

191
00:10:01,216 --> 00:10:03,624
- You got my rent check, right?
- I did. Everything's good.

192
00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:06,718
I just, uh, I wanted
to introduce Deja to Sky.

193
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,356
CHICHI: Sky, over here.

194
00:10:09,796 --> 00:10:11,897
RANDALL: Hey, Sky. This is Deja.

195
00:10:11,929 --> 00:10:13,233
Deja, Sky.

- Hey.
- Hi.

Uh, were ya'll just stepping?

198
00:10:17,155 --> 00:10:18,232
Yeah, you step?

199
00:10:18,257 --> 00:10:19,838
No, but I was on a drill team.

200
00:10:19,863 --> 00:10:22,366
Oh, cool. Come on,
I'll show you what we're doing.

201
00:10:32,694 --> 00:10:34,976
Why is that mattress
up against the wall?

202
00:10:35,046 --> 00:10:37,952
- Because of the hole.
- Well, why is there a hole?

203
00:10:38,439 --> 00:10:40,069
Because of the busted pipe.

204
00:10:42,929 --> 00:10:44,396
Why is there a busted pipe?

205
00:10:44,421 --> 00:10:45,993
Because of the water heater.

206
00:10:46,027 --> 00:10:47,779
Randall, are we going
to play this game all day?

207
00:10:47,804 --> 00:10:49,248
Because I'd like to get back to my book.

208
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:50,366
Nah.

209
00:10:56,249 --> 00:10:58,670
Why doesn't somebody call
the city or Parks and Rec,

210
00:10:58,695 --> 00:10:59,999
fix this place up?

211
00:11:00,249 --> 00:11:01,942
We call all the time.

212
00:11:01,977 --> 00:11:03,310
It doesn't work.

213
00:11:03,345 --> 00:11:05,929
We don't even have
proper street lighting.

214
00:11:07,108 --> 00:11:09,283
But if you think you can do better

215
00:11:09,317 --> 00:11:12,686
after sitting around
for all of five minutes,

216
00:11:12,721 --> 00:11:14,382
feel free to go to city hall.

217
00:11:15,046 --> 00:11:16,423
Talk to Councilman Brown.

218
00:11:17,491 --> 00:11:18,718
Maybe I will.

219
00:11:19,077 --> 00:11:20,257
Okay.

220
00:11:20,384 --> 00:11:21,818
Maybe I will right now.

221
00:11:22,468 --> 00:11:23,765
(LAUGHS) Okay.

222
00:11:24,347 --> 00:11:25,522
Okay.

223
00:11:30,203 --> 00:11:32,093
I had to tell you guys first,
Ms. Yvette.

Yeah, and I'm-a make sure
you pledge, too.

there for an education.

tonight to celebrate.

I'll make my fried okra.

to meet the realtor.

I got to go, but tonight sounds good.

237

I just have to ask my mom first.

238
00:12:02,757 --> 00:12:04,657
Okay and that's the living room.

239
00:12:04,817 --> 00:12:06,788
Let's take a look at the kitchen.

JACK: <i>You got to admit,</i>

241
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:10,632
<i>this place gets more light than ours.</i>

242
00:12:11,054 --> 00:12:13,004
Yeah, well, light is overrated.

243
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:14,436
REALTOR: This way.

244
00:12:17,218 --> 00:12:19,639
Now, this house does
only have three bedrooms,

245
00:12:19,673 --> 00:12:21,888
- so if that's an issue...
- No, no, it's fine.

246
00:12:21,913 --> 00:12:24,151
I mean, the boys
can share a room, right?

247
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:25,554
I mean, Randall,
you're gonna be heading off

248
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:26,913
to college in the fall

249
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:29,093
and Kate, fingers crossed,

250
00:12:29,118 --> 00:12:30,952
you'll hear from Berklee any day now.

251
00:12:31,632 --> 00:12:33,452
As for me, I'll be right here.

252
00:12:35,744 --> 00:12:36,952

253
00:12:38,995 --> 00:12:40,397
What do you mean?

254
00:12:46,206 --> 00:12:48,210
I never sent in the tape they asked for

255
00:12:48,466 --> 00:12:50,200
for my callback audition.

256
00:12:54,085 --> 00:12:55,505
- I-I bet you can still
- Nope.

257
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:56,975
- apply for springtime.
- I'm done.

258
00:12:57,538 --> 00:12:58,904
RANDALL: But if you just explain...

259
00:12:58,929 --> 00:13:00,780
Randall, she said she's done, all right?

260
00:13:10,061 --> 00:13:12,380
Um, have you seen the backyard?

261
00:13:12,405 --> 00:13:14,294
It's like a vacation out there.

262
00:13:14,554 --> 00:13:16,229
That sounds nice.

263
00:13:16,263 --> 00:13:18,331

- I like the tiny hat.

I might've made too much is all

293

It's not bad.

297

That's fine. Don't worry about it.

So, uh, I took Deja to this rec

about buying it?

350
00:18:38,776 --> 00:18:39,940
My man.

351
00:18:39,965 --> 00:18:41,674
Hey, babe, I got to finish up here.

352
00:18:41,699 --> 00:18:42,729
I'm buried in work.

353
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:44,287
All right. I'll see you tonight.

354
00:18:52,486 --> 00:18:54,447
JACK: You could grow basil for pesto.

355
00:18:57,714 --> 00:18:59,557
When have you ever eaten pesto?

356
00:19:09,158 --> 00:19:10,453
Where are you right now?

357
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:12,383
What?

358
00:19:13,703 --> 00:19:14,906
Sorry, hon.

359
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:16,937
I'm right here.

360
00:19:19,504 --> 00:19:21,171
So what do you think of this place?

361
00:19:21,867 --> 00:19:23,289
Have you noticed Kate's eating?

362
00:19:24,265 --> 00:19:25,272
Randall...

363
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:26,953
You know, and Kevin's
drunk half the time.

364
00:19:28,305 --> 00:19:29,648
But-but you don't seem to care.

365
00:19:30,883 --> 00:19:32,148
I do care.

366
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:35,594
I'm doing the very best that I can.

367
00:19:35,906 --> 00:19:37,039
They're both grieving.

368
00:19:37,064 --> 00:19:38,758
- What would you like me to do?
- I don't know.

369
00:19:40,515 --> 00:19:43,016
But anything. I mean, you lied.

370
00:19:43,133 --> 00:19:45,420
You said that you'd take care
of everything.

371
00:19:45,445 --> 00:19:46,648
You said we'd be okay,

372
00:19:46,673 --> 00:19:48,203
that you'd step up and make sure of it,

373
00:19:48,339 --> 00:19:49,633
but you lied.

374
00:19:51,635 --> 00:19:52,812
Mm-hmm.

375
00:19:56,719 --> 00:19:57,914
Yeah.

376
00:19:57,939 --> 00:19:59,940
It's getting late.
I think we need to go.

378
00:20:19,228 --> 00:20:21,508
she has a daughter who did the in vitro.

379
00:20:21,533 --> 00:20:22,851
- REBECCA: Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- Remember?

380
00:20:22,876 --> 00:20:25,601
The cute, little twins
with the weird names.

381
00:20:25,626 --> 00:20:27,594
- What were they?
- Eloise and Plaza.

382
00:20:27,619 --> 00:20:28,875
- Yeah.
- REBECCA: Mm-hmm.

383
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,867
Terrible names. Yeah.

384
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,258
- Mom.
- Hmm?

385
00:20:35,283 --> 00:20:37,742
- What's up?
- What? Nothing.

386
00:20:38,172 --> 00:20:39,625
Nothing at all, Bug.

387
00:20:40,563 --> 00:20:42,609
This is exactly what
I was trying to avoid.

Just say it.

389
00:20:49,976 --> 00:20:54,648
Kate, have you guys really
considered all of the risks?

390
00:20:54,673 --> 00:20:56,101
Oh, can we not do this?

391
00:20:56,126 --> 00:20:57,601
I'm sure that they've done
the research...

392
00:20:57,626 --> 00:21:00,826
Because I-I did learn a lot
from helping my friend Carol

393
00:21:00,851 --> 00:21:03,156
and I know that
the egg retrieval surgery

394

My father lived in the building

411

When he passed away,
my wife and I took it as

412

a personal mission

Good for you. Come on, sit.

(SIGHS)

417
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,484
I'm actually here about

418
00:22:11,509 --> 00:22:13,351
the rec center on Fifth Street.

419
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,375
The place is falling apart.

420
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:18,133
I'm talking holes in the wall,
water damage.

421
00:22:18,158 --> 00:22:20,780
The streetlights out front are
either broken or missing.

422
00:22:20,805 --> 00:22:23,265
Yeah, that place isn't what it was.

423
00:22:24,657 --> 00:22:25,844
Kills me.

424
00:22:26,924 --> 00:22:28,424
What part of town do you live in?

425
00:22:28,531 --> 00:22:30,000
Oh, I actually live in New Jersey.

426
00:22:30,062 --> 00:22:32,864
- In the suburbs.
- Oh, good for you.

427
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,765
I grew up in South Philly.

428
00:22:37,199 --> 00:22:39,834
Spent a lot of time at
a rec center myself back then.

429
00:22:40,094 --> 00:22:41,390
Ree's Recreation Center.

430
00:22:41,415 --> 00:22:43,375
- Ever hear of it?
- No, I can't say that I have.

431
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,202
My pops owned the grocery store
right across the street from it.

432
00:22:46,734 --> 00:22:49,101
I think I was in high school

433
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:50,898
when there was a shooting at Ree's.

434
00:22:51,305 --> 00:22:52,711
The mayor tried to shut it down,

435
00:22:52,736 --> 00:22:54,140
but my pops wasn't having it.

436
00:22:54,386 --> 00:22:57,625
He always said, "Boy,
ain't nothin' worth having

437
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:59,070
if you ain't willing to fight for it."

438
00:22:59,746 --> 00:23:02,008
He got everybody in the neighborhood

439
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:04,590
to rally to keep Ree's open.

440
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:07,945
Your father sounds like
he was the real deal.

441
00:23:08,898 --> 00:23:12,242
He was. He really was.

442
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,078
Last year, I cast the deciding vote

443
00:23:18,103 --> 00:23:19,844
to shut Ree's down.

444
00:23:20,937 --> 00:23:25,474
Eh, it wasn't structurally
sound, became dangerous.

445
00:23:26,337 --> 00:23:28,219
In my position, Mr. Pearson,

446
00:23:29,066 --> 00:23:31,434
I have to make decisions
I don't always love.

447
00:23:32,101 --> 00:23:33,695
Ironic, isn't it?

448
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:35,820
I got into politics to honor a man

449
00:23:35,845 --> 00:23:38,180
who I'd now be constantly disappointing.

00:23:39,028 --> 00:23:40,406

451
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,703
I'm adopted.

452
00:23:44,211 --> 00:23:46,773
My adoptive father passed away as well.

453
00:23:48,055 --> 00:23:50,125
So I have two dead fathers

you have swallowed every single
comment about my weight,

505
00:26:33,296 --> 00:26:35,435
but now, you want to
bring it up now because

506

- it's something that I want?
- Kate!

507
00:26:37,444 --> 00:26:38,811
Where do I draw the line?

508
00:26:39,365 --> 00:26:41,325
How do I toe the line, Kate, because...

509
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,396
Shut up! Everyone just shut up!

510
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:51,138
This is... it's not about you, Rebecca.

It's not about any of you.

512

513
00:26:56,832 --> 00:26:58,083
All right? We lost a child,

514
00:26:58,108 --> 00:26:59,482
and now we want to start a family.

515
00:26:59,507 --> 00:27:01,810
And we needed a little help
because we have bad eggs,

516
00:27:01,835 --> 00:27:04,208
and apparently I have really bad sperm.

517
00:27:04,525 --> 00:27:06,760

work out for us.

00:27:24,618 --> 00:27:26,325
I'll see you guys at the premiere.

526
00:27:40,728 --> 00:27:42,929
Five, six, seven, eight.

527
00:27:47,853 --> 00:27:49,929
WILLIAM: <i>Hi, my name is William,
and I'm an addict.</i>

528

GROUP: <i>Hi, William.</i>

529
00:27:51,997 --> 00:27:56,236
I've been clean for five years
and... one minute.

530

(CHUCKLES)

531
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,197
Strange thing to celebrate, huh?

532
00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:03,798
Somehow it feels more special
than my own birthday.

533
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:09,115
I started using 30 years ago,
when I lost my mother.

534
00:28:09,642 --> 00:28:11,814
The only family I ever really had.

535
00:28:18,642 --> 00:28:21,294
Then I moved a couple of blocks away,

536
00:28:21,328 --> 00:28:22,689
and all that changed.

537
00:28:23,634 --> 00:28:26,414
I met Sam, who drove for Septa

538
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:28,902
and didn't begrudge me
when I couldn't pay my fare.

539
00:28:29,431 --> 00:28:32,805
And Bernadette, who bested
this old junkie

540
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,650
to a game of chess, and for her prize

541
00:28:34,675 --> 00:28:36,743
asked that I accompany her
to an NA meeting.

542
00:28:38,963 --> 00:28:40,542
And last night I met

543
00:28:40,567 --> 00:28:42,884
this young Nigerian woman named ChiChi.

544
00:28:46,713 --> 00:28:48,799
<i>And she let me hold her beautiful baby.</i>

545
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:51,033
<i>And she told me I was a natural.</i>

546
00:28:51,137 --> 00:28:53,805
<i>And it might as well have been
my birthday when she said that.</i>

547
00:28:55,301 --> 00:28:57,056
When she gave me that gift.

548
00:29:06,929 --> 00:29:08,563
WILLIAM: <i>Community.</i>

549
00:29:09,822 --> 00:29:11,713
<i>That's a strange word on its own.</i>

550
00:29:12,408 --> 00:29:14,280
The word's not as warm as "family,"

551
00:29:14,315 --> 00:29:17,244
but some people, people like myself,

552
00:29:17,269 --> 00:29:18,705
<i>we don't have family.</i>

553
00:29:19,892 --> 00:29:24,134
<i>But that's okay
because we have each other.</i>

554
00:29:24,902 --> 00:29:26,486
<i>We have this place...</i>

555
00:29:27,528 --> 00:29:29,062
<i>and that's not nothin'.</i>

556
00:29:31,709 --> 00:29:33,970
<i>That's not nothin' at all.</i>

557
00:29:41,111 --> 00:29:42,447
I'm going to Ms. Yvette's.

558
00:29:43,311 --> 00:29:44,745
Okay, sweetheart.

- No, no.

Randall, it's a struggle for me

566
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,303
to get out of bed every morning.

567
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:16,242
It takes every single ounce
of energy that I have,

568
00:30:16,277 --> 00:30:18,416
and then I have nothing left
for the rest of the day.

569
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:19,627
Nothing.

570
00:30:26,244 --> 00:30:28,388
And I know that isn't fair to you guys,

571

Huh.

574
00:30:40,666 --> 00:30:42,822
Did you know that your father took me

575
00:30:42,847 --> 00:30:46,725
to look at a new house
a few months before the fire?

576
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,556
Come on, Bec.
What's the harm in looking?

577
00:30:52,581 --> 00:30:54,759
Yeah, I've heard that one before.

578
00:30:56,417 --> 00:30:59,452
Sometimes I think about where
we would all be right now

579
00:30:59,486 --> 00:31:00,799
if we had bought it.

580
00:31:01,088 --> 00:31:03,122
This house does get a lot more light

581
00:31:03,157 --> 00:31:04,494
than our place, right?

582
00:31:05,305 --> 00:31:07,228
Yeah, well, light is overrated.

You could grow anything you want.

584

maybe some basil for pesto.

586

- I loved your father.

his family. He was one of us.
