Uh... (LAUGHS)

349
00:13:16,692 --> 00:13:19,293
I'm a little nervous.

350
00:13:19,294 --> 00:13:20,962
I know I told you this morning

351
00:13:20,963 --> 00:13:23,898
what brought me here, and I just...

352
00:13:23,899 --> 00:13:25,466
This is important to me.

353

- I want to do this right.

- All right, I'm all yours.

00:14:05,474 --> 00:14:07,275
Yeah, you've probably never
heard of the director before.

369
00:14:07,276 --> 00:14:09,377
His name is Jordan Martin Foster.

370
00:14:09,378 --> 00:14:11,812
He won the Jury Prize at Cannes.

371
00:14:15,484 --> 00:14:16,851
Are you okay?

372
00:14:16,852 --> 00:14:18,586
Yeah, fine.

373
00:14:21,757 --> 00:14:24,358
Just so you know: sex scenes
couldn't be less sexy.

00:14:24,359 --> 00:14:26,093
Okay? And I'm not even kidding.

375
00:14:26,094 --> 00:14:27,528
I mean, you got crew members

00:14:27,529 --> 00:14:28,963
standing around all over the place.

377
00:14:28,964 --> 00:14:30,398
Plus, with COVID now, I don't even know

378
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,933
if we'll be in the same studio.

379
00:14:31,934 --> 00:14:33,401
For all I know,
I'll be in Burbank somewhere,

she'll be in Culver City,
and they'll just

381
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:36,270
throw us together in post.

382
00:14:36,271 --> 00:14:37,571
You got nothing to worry about.

383
00:14:37,573 --> 00:14:39,073
I'm not worried about it. Let's go back.

- My feet hurt.
- I'm sorry. Excuse me.

385
00:14:41,276 --> 00:14:44,779
I'm so sorry. I just wanted
to say I am a big fan.

00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,547
- Oh, thank you.
- Um, Julia.

Okay.

Oh. Wow. Congratulations.

How many weeks do you have to go?

391
00:14:54,056 --> 00:14:56,557
- Um, just a few months.
- Oh, lucky girl.

to the filming of the love
scene if that's really

403
00:15:20,725 --> 00:15:22,459
- what's bothering you.
- I am not upset about the love scene.

404
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,793
It seems like you're upset
about the love scene.

405

I'm not upset about the love scene!

I'm upset about the pancakes.

00:15:26,998 --> 00:15:28,965
I'm upset that she
can tell I'm pregnant.

Okay, I'm-I'm upset
about a whole bunch of stuff

I'm not comfortable sharing with you

You were supposed to check the
diaper supply before we left.

No, I checked the
diaper supply yesterday

494

and saw that we were low

495
00:19:08,683 --> 00:19:10,583
and wrote "diapers"
on the shopping list.

496
00:19:10,584 --> 00:19:12,652
Right, and then I bought
the diapers that were

497
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:14,320
on the shopping list, and
you were supposed to take them

498

- out of the trunk.
- We wouldn't run out of diapers so fast

499

I'm not gonna hoard diapers, Tobe.

00:19:20,461 --> 00:19:22,362
Like, other people need diapers, too.

502
00:19:22,363 --> 00:19:24,998
I'm not talking about buying
all of the diapers in the world,

503
00:19:24,999 --> 00:19:26,533
but this kid is a human outhouse.

504
00:19:26,534 --> 00:19:28,435
Maybe if we just get, like,
an extra box or two.

505
00:19:28,436 --> 00:19:31,104
Okay, so it's my fault? It would
be really great, just, like,

506
00:19:31,105 --> 00:19:33,206
one time if you could be like,
"My fault,"

507
00:19:33,207 --> 00:19:34,908
like you took the blame
just for something.

508
00:19:34,909 --> 00:19:36,109
Just like, "Hey, it was me."

509
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,278
I take the blame for everything.

rolling off the tongue.

I'm sorry I left the diapers
in the trunk.

- I'm an idiot.
- Babe, you're not an idiot.

517
00:19:53,994 --> 00:19:55,895
And we both know that,
uh, we've had our son

I did tell the teacher.

553
00:21:22,149 --> 00:21:24,684
I said, "Please don't touch my hair."

Silence in the face of injustice

559

or a bathroom mirror?

669
00:27:09,233 --> 00:27:11,634
I keep that there

670
00:27:11,635 --> 00:27:15,738

674
00:27:26,917 --> 00:27:29,085

675
00:27:29,086 --> 00:27:31,854
And they announce the number out loud,

676
00:27:31,855 --> 00:27:34,357
and I have to remind myself

677
00:27:34,358 --> 00:27:37,450

No, Kev, come on.

The bar is-is plenty heavy.
All right? But first,

708

what I want you to do is,
you got to warm up.

709
00:29:12,461 --> 00:29:13,928
Right? We got to loosen things up.

710
00:29:13,929 --> 00:29:16,464
Pull your arm through.
Warm your shoulders up.

Go the other arm. All right.

- text her as much, please?
- She texted me.

- Not really.

change her mind about us.

751
00:31:08,877 --> 00:31:10,878
So instead of asking me
to be more excited,

752
00:31:10,879 --> 00:31:14,048
could maybe you... you try
to be a little more terrified?

753
00:31:14,049 --> 00:31:16,851
(SIGHS) Okay.

754
00:31:17,786 --> 00:31:21,422
You know what, she does smile
a lot when she rubs her belly.

the opposite, obviously,

was Babu Frik.

That's a fresh take. Respect.

765
00:31:46,314 --> 00:31:49,250
And did you see the look
on her face when she noticed

766
00:31:49,251 --> 00:31:51,318
that we had forgotten
the diapers in the car?

767
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:55,322
That was the look of a woman
who is falling hard for us.

- Yeah. Those are good things.
