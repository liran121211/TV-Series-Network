00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,422
<i>near our house
that has this zip line</i>

341
00:13:34,596 --> 00:13:36,728
<i>that I think Willow
would really like.</i>

342
00:13:36,903 --> 00:13:38,078
<i>Of course,
we're coming down there</i>

343
00:13:38,252 --> 00:13:39,644
<i>for her birthday next month.</i>

344
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:42,082
<i>Oh, does she...
does Willow still like unicorns?</i>

345
00:13:42,256 --> 00:13:44,084
<i>Or are unicorns,
like, so last week...</i>

346
00:13:44,258 --> 00:13:45,737
<i>Yeah, she's into unicorns.</i>

347
00:13:45,912 --> 00:13:47,783
<i>[Hailey fussing]</i>

348
00:13:47,957 --> 00:13:50,394
<i>I will never not like unicorns.</i>

<i>[Kate chuckles]</i>

350
00:14:00,143 --> 00:14:02,624
<i>It's just a couple of blocks
down on the right.
Okay.</i>

351
00:14:02,798 --> 00:14:04,756
<i>Okay, so, uh,
we'll call you, you know,</i>

352
00:14:04,931 --> 00:14:06,976
<i>once we're all settled in
and everything. And listen,</i>

353
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,804
<i>if you want to go
to that park that I mentioned...</i>

354
00:14:08,978 --> 00:14:10,719
<i>Hey, I'm sorry,
but I can't, I can't do this.</i>

355
00:14:12,112 --> 00:14:13,983
<i>What do you mean?</i>

356
00:14:14,157 --> 00:14:18,118
<i>Um, I know that we said yes
to open adoption, and we said...</i>

357
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:19,902
<i>yes to visits and photos
and phone calls,</i>

358
00:14:20,076 --> 00:14:20,990
<i>but I-I can't do it.</i>

359
00:14:21,164 --> 00:14:22,949
<i>I can't have her in my life.</i>

360
00:14:23,123 --> 00:14:24,298
<i>I don't know, maybe...
maybe someday</i>

361
00:14:24,472 --> 00:14:26,213
<i>I'll be able to,
but I can't right now.</i>

362
00:14:29,042 --> 00:14:31,348
<i>Well, maybe it's something
that we can talk about.</i>

363
00:14:31,522 --> 00:14:32,741
<i>I mean,
how can we make it work...
Kate. Kate, Kate...</i>

364
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:34,351
<i>Kate, I don't want to talk
about it.</i>

365
00:14:34,525 --> 00:14:36,005
<i>I really just want
to say goodbye to Hailey,</i>

00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:37,137
<i>and I want to go home.</i>

<i>Okay, well, what if, uh,
a friend or a member</i>

<i>I will call you,

<i>Shirtless?
Excuse me?</i>

437
00:17:58,207 --> 00:18:00,035
<i>The picture's worth more
if he's not wearing a shirt.</i>

438
00:18:00,209 --> 00:18:02,472
<i>Fine. I will make sure
he's not wearing a shirt.</i>

439
00:18:02,646 --> 00:18:04,170
<i>Tight shorts

<i>Ugh. That's disgusting.</i>

441
00:18:05,954 --> 00:18:07,347
<i>Thank you.</i>

442
00:18:16,573 --> 00:18:18,184
<i>What did you say to that guy?</i>

443
00:18:18,358 --> 00:18:20,882
<i>Okay, Kevin, you're exhausted.</i>

444
00:18:21,056 --> 00:18:24,799
<i>Okay? I'm gonna need you
at your best.</i>

445
00:18:24,973 --> 00:18:29,151
<i>And aggro Liam Neeson movie
Kevin is not you at your best.</i>

446
00:18:30,457 --> 00:18:33,199
<i>We have 20 minutes
until we get home.</i>

447
00:18:33,373 --> 00:18:35,201
<i>I'm driving. Get some rest.</i>

448
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,072
<i>I've got this.</i>

449
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,562
<i>Here we go.</i>

<i>Okay. [sniffles]</i>

452
00:18:51,565 --> 00:18:53,262
<i>I'll go in and get it for you.</i>

<i>One Snickers Blizzard

<i>What size?
Is that even a question?</i>

455
00:18:58,224 --> 00:18:59,747
<i>The biggest Snickers Blizzard.</i>

456
00:18:59,921 --> 00:19:01,749
<i>A Snickers avalanche
if they have it.</i>

457
00:19:01,923 --> 00:19:04,273
<i>No school for days
after I eat this Blizzard.</i>

00:19:04,447 --> 00:19:05,796
<i>[chuckles]
I'm talking power outages</i>

<i>and white-out conditions.</i>

460
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:14,588
<i>What?</i>

461
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,287
<i>Can I just say one more thing</i>

462
00:19:18,461 --> 00:19:20,289
<i>about not closing the door
to having a third kid?</i>

463
00:19:20,463 --> 00:19:22,509
<i>Are you out of your mind? Do I
have to throw something at you?</i>

464
00:19:22,683 --> 00:19:25,033
<i>I guess I always thought
that if we had two girls,</i>

465
00:19:25,207 --> 00:19:26,643
<i>that we would go for a boy.</i>

466
00:19:26,817 --> 00:19:29,342
<i>You did not just say
"go for a boy."</i>

467
00:19:29,516 --> 00:19:31,648
<i>I always imagined myself
throwing the ball around</i>

468
00:19:31,822 --> 00:19:33,824
<i>with the boy, you know, having
that special relationship?</i>

469
00:19:33,998 --> 00:19:35,826
<i>Special relationship? You used
to go over to your mom's house</i>

470
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,785
<i>every Sunday
to watch Felicitytogether.
I...</i>

471
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:39,569
<i>You think that wasn't
a special relationship?</i>

472
00:19:39,743 --> 00:19:40,962
<i>It doesn't have to be a boy.</i>

473
00:19:41,136 --> 00:19:42,398
<i>I would love a third girl.</i>

474
00:19:42,572 --> 00:19:44,922
<i>I'm just saying,
we make great kids.</i>

475
00:19:45,096 --> 00:19:46,315
<i>And I don't want
to close the door.</i>

476
00:19:46,489 --> 00:19:48,404
<i>Then, Randall,
you carry the next one.</i>

477
00:19:49,971 --> 00:19:51,451
<i>I'm gonna get my own Blizzard.</i>

478
00:20:01,461 --> 00:20:03,637

<i>You want to be on time,

<i>[both laugh]</i>

483
00:20:30,011 --> 00:20:32,100
<i>Just wrong.</i>

<i>Oh.
Mm.</i>

485
00:20:37,975 --> 00:20:40,151
<i>What's this?</i>

486
00:20:40,326 --> 00:20:43,067
<i>I know it's early, and I know
you're not telling anyone,</i>

487
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,331
<i>but I had
to get you something.</i>

488
00:20:45,505 --> 00:20:47,028
<i>It's this old-school toy
from France.</i>

489
00:20:47,202 --> 00:20:49,204
<i>They're like magic
for babies.</i>

490
00:20:53,556 --> 00:20:55,384
<i>It's not gonna stay
a secret long</i>

491
00:20:55,558 --> 00:20:57,038
<i>if you keep touching
your belly like that.</i>

492
00:20:57,212 --> 00:20:59,693
<i>What? I didn't touch my belly.
Mm-hmm.</i>

493
00:21:01,042 --> 00:21:03,044
<i>It is cute, right?</i>

494
00:21:03,218 --> 00:21:05,307
<i>You're gonna love it.
It is like magic.</i>

495
00:21:05,481 --> 00:21:07,309
<i>[both laugh]
You ready?</i>

496
00:21:07,483 --> 00:21:09,572

00:21:48,742 --> 00:21:50,221
<i>Uh...</i>

505
00:21:50,396 --> 00:21:51,919
<i>Yeah. Why don't...</i>

506
00:21:52,093 --> 00:21:55,270
<i>I get one of those,
uh, little whiskeys?</i>

507
00:21:55,444 --> 00:21:57,185
<i>And these mints?</i>

<i>[sniffles]</i>

509
00:22:01,102 --> 00:22:03,626
<i>New dad. Celebrating.</i>

510
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,715
<i>All right. Congrats.</i>

511
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:27,998
<i>Thought you might be hungry.</i>

512
00:22:28,172 --> 00:22:31,611
<i>Um... hey, baby, how bout...</i>

513
00:22:31,785 --> 00:22:34,788
<i>how about you drive?
You okay to drive?</i>

514
00:22:34,962 --> 00:22:38,444
<i>That way, I can turn around
and make sure the kids are okay.</i>

515
00:22:40,794 --> 00:22:42,752
<i>Yeah, okay.
Okay.</i>

516
00:22:48,671 --> 00:22:50,934
<i>She took the bottle,</i>

517
00:22:51,108 --> 00:22:53,154
<i>and she's out.</i>

518
00:22:53,328 --> 00:22:54,895
<i>You can just call me
"Dr. Sleep."</i>

519
00:22:55,069 --> 00:22:56,636
<i>Wait.</i>

520
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:58,289
<i>No, don't do that.</i>

521
00:22:58,464 --> 00:23:00,466
<i>It sounds... [sighs]</i>

522
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,250
<i>...murdery.</i>

523
00:23:02,424 --> 00:23:04,600
<i>Well, great. Thank you.</i>

524
00:23:04,774 --> 00:23:06,559
<i>I just spoke
to the babysitter,</i>

525
00:23:06,733 --> 00:23:08,996
<i>and she's gonna bring Jack home
in half an hour, so...</i>

526
00:23:11,694 --> 00:23:13,522
<i>Kate, there's something
I need to talk to you...</i>

527
00:23:13,696 --> 00:23:15,306
<i>Toby, how are you not more upset
about this?</i>

528
00:23:15,481 --> 00:23:17,004
<i>Honestly.</i>

529
00:23:17,178 --> 00:23:18,788
<i>We signed up
for an open adoption,</i>

530
00:23:18,962 --> 00:23:21,008
<i>and that just all changed</i>

531
00:23:21,182 --> 00:23:23,053
<i>in a really sad blink of an eye.</i>

532
00:23:23,227 --> 00:23:26,317
<i>Kate, I am sorry
that Ellie is hurting.</i>

533
00:23:26,492 --> 00:23:28,363
<i>I feel bad.</i>

534
00:23:28,537 --> 00:23:30,234
<i>But when we got into
all of this,</i>

535
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,019
<i>we knew that it was all
just a plan.</i>

536
00:23:32,193 --> 00:23:34,500
<i>We also knew that plans change.</i>

537
00:23:34,674 --> 00:23:36,589
<i>Toby, I grew up with a brother</i>

538
00:23:36,763 --> 00:23:40,331
<i>who, like, didn't know
his birth parents.</i>

539
00:23:40,506 --> 00:23:43,073
<i>That was... is... is still</i>

540
00:23:43,247 --> 00:23:44,814
<i>really, really difficult
for him.</i>

541
00:23:44,988 --> 00:23:48,035
<i>I know.
Okay, well, I promised myself</i>

542
00:23:48,209 --> 00:23:49,993
<i>that it would not be like that
for Hailey.</i>

543
00:23:50,167 --> 00:23:51,908
<i>And it won't.</i>

544
00:23:52,082 --> 00:23:56,522
<i>Kate, adoption is a journey.</i>

545
00:23:56,696 --> 00:23:59,046
<i>You know, and-and we don't know
when or if</i>

546
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:02,092
<i>Ellie is gonna change her mind,
but we will always make sure</i>

547
00:24:02,266 --> 00:24:03,877
<i>that Hailey knows
who her birth mother is.</i>

548
00:24:04,051 --> 00:24:05,531
<i>[Hailey crying]</i>

549
00:24:05,705 --> 00:24:07,054
<i>I'll get her.
I'll get her.</i>

550
00:24:07,228 --> 00:24:09,317
<i>All right. [sighs]</i>

551
00:24:09,491 --> 00:24:10,710
<i>[Toby sniffles]</i>

552
00:24:10,884 --> 00:24:12,886
<i>[Hailey cries loudly]</i>

553
00:24:14,235 --> 00:24:16,542
<i>I apologize
that you had to listen</i>

554
00:24:16,716 --> 00:24:19,588
<i>to that little dispute
between me and your mother.</i>

555
00:24:19,762 --> 00:24:23,244
<i>And I apologize for my
antiquated gender assumptions.</i>

556
00:24:23,418 --> 00:24:25,376
<i>I will throw a ball with you
any day of the week.</i>

557
00:24:25,551 --> 00:24:28,423
<i>Or watch Felicity,
whatever you like.</i>

558
00:24:30,033 --> 00:24:32,427
<i>So you and I have the same eyes.</i>

559
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:37,867
<i>When the nurse said that,
it made me very happy.</i>

560
00:24:39,782 --> 00:24:44,091
<i>Because I grew up not looking
like either of my parents,</i>

561
00:24:44,265 --> 00:24:46,702
<i>not knowing exactly
where I came from.</i>

562
00:24:47,921 --> 00:24:50,184
<i>So to know
that you have my eyes,</i>

563
00:24:50,358 --> 00:24:53,230
<i>that you came from me--</i>

564
00:24:53,404 --> 00:24:55,363
<i>that's special.</i>

565
00:24:55,537 --> 00:24:57,583
<i>Thank you.</i>

566
00:24:57,757 --> 00:24:59,933
<i>When I was a kid,</i>

567
00:25:00,107 --> 00:25:03,676
<i>I had to do
a family tree for school.</i>

568
00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:10,117
<i>And, um, I remember
making my branches,</i>

569
00:25:10,291 --> 00:25:13,337
<i>along with my brother
and sister.</i>

570
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,775
<i>But I knew
it wasn't quite right.</i>

571
00:25:15,949 --> 00:25:17,733
<i>They were my family,</i>

572
00:25:17,907 --> 00:25:20,649
<i>but they weren't
where I came from.</i>

573
00:25:20,823 --> 00:25:23,130
<i>You see, that's where you</i>

574
00:25:23,304 --> 00:25:25,698
<i>and your sister Tess
and your mom come in.</i>

575
00:25:25,872 --> 00:25:29,223
<i>You've provided me
with something very special.</i>

576
00:25:32,095 --> 00:25:33,793
<i>Because you are my branches.</i>

577
00:25:35,969 --> 00:25:37,971
<i>You are the start
of my family tree.</i>

578
00:25:40,843 --> 00:25:44,151
<i>And I just wanted that tree
to be as big as possible.</i>

579
00:25:48,372 --> 00:25:51,637
<i>But, hey, I guess I'm gonna have
to count on you and your sister</i>

580
00:25:51,811 --> 00:25:55,379
<i>to have a whole lot
of grandchildren.</i>

581
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,556
<i>And then maybe one day,
I will look into the eyes</i>

582
00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:00,950
<i>of my grandchild
or my great-grandchild,</i>

583
00:26:01,124 --> 00:26:03,213
<i>and I will say,</i>

584
00:26:03,387 --> 00:26:07,827
<i>"Hey, I know
where those eyes come from."</i>

585
00:26:09,219 --> 00:26:12,179
<i>"Those eyes come
from Annie Pearson."</i>

586

<i>[sniffles loudly]</i>

587
00:26:15,008 --> 00:26:16,444
<i>That's a peace offering?</i>

588
00:26:16,618 --> 00:26:18,054
<i>No, they're both for me.</i>

589
00:26:18,228 --> 00:26:20,970
<i>[Randall smacks lips, hisses]</i>

590
00:26:39,032 --> 00:26:40,773
<i>All right.</i>

591
00:26:40,947 --> 00:26:43,210
<i>Do not interrupt me
for the next ten minutes.</i>

592
00:26:43,384 --> 00:26:45,212
<i>All right. I don't know
if you're ready.</i>

593
00:26:45,386 --> 00:26:47,344
<i>I'm ready. Oh, I'm ready.
Yeah?</i>

<i>Oh. Uh...</i>

597
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:22,510
<i>Are they actually...?</i>

598
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:24,425
<i>Let me... let me check.</i>

599
00:27:45,054 --> 00:27:47,187
<i>All three knocked out.</i>

600
00:27:47,361 --> 00:27:50,930
<i>[whispering]
They must have
exhausted themselves crying.</i>

601
00:27:51,104 --> 00:27:52,714
<i>Do we bring 'em inside?</i>

602
00:27:52,888 --> 00:27:55,108
<i>Oh, no, no, no. They say
never wake a sleeping baby.</i>

603
00:27:55,282 --> 00:27:57,763
<i>Well, what do they say
about three sleeping babies?</i>

604
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,593
<i>I think we just wait.</i>

605
00:28:02,768 --> 00:28:05,466
<i>Okay.</i>

606
00:28:09,818 --> 00:28:11,864

<i>She's only happy

610
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:47,508
<i>So...
Like daughter, like father.</i>

611
00:28:52,339 --> 00:28:54,341
<i>Kate, do you know why
Ellie chose us?</i>

612
00:28:54,515 --> 00:28:56,691
<i>'Cause I like the Steelers?</i>

613
00:28:56,865 --> 00:28:59,389
<i>Maybe. [laughs]</i>

614
00:28:59,563 --> 00:29:01,914
<i>I'm sure
my quirky-meets-classy style</i>

615
00:29:02,088 --> 00:29:03,829
<i>didn't hurt anything.
[chuckles]</i>

616
00:29:05,874 --> 00:29:10,052
<i>But more than that,
she chose us, she chose you,</i>

617
00:29:10,226 --> 00:29:14,535
<i>because she saw a funny,
beautiful,</i>

618
00:29:14,709 --> 00:29:17,320
<i>huge-hearted mother
who has taken every challenge</i>

619

<i>that parenting has to offer
in total stride.</i>

620
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,065
<i>Kate, you're unflappable.</i>

621
00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:25,111
<i>Really. You cannot be flapped.</i>

622
00:29:25,285 --> 00:29:27,330
<i>All right, and-and all of this
may not be going</i>

623

<i>the way that we planned,</i>

<i>and Ellie may or may not be
in the picture,</i>

<i>but we will figure this out.</i>

<i>And it's a good thing
that you are...</i>

628

<i>so unflappable,

<i>when I was on the phone
with work...</i>

630

<i>Wow.</i>
