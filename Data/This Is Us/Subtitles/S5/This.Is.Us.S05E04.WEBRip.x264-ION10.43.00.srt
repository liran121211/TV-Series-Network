1
00:00:01,784 --> 00:00:03,438
-Previously onThis Is Us...
-How was football?

2
00:00:03,612 --> 00:00:06,049
Coach said we've got another
Terry Bradshaw right here.

3
00:00:06,223 --> 00:00:07,703
Minus the hair loss.

4
00:00:07,877 --> 00:00:09,139
Ten...

5
00:00:09,313 --> 00:00:10,619
You really think
it's okay for Kev

6
00:00:10,793 --> 00:00:12,316
to be pumping iron?

7
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:13,926
-Hey, I got this.
-I think I just got the part.

8
00:00:14,101 --> 00:00:16,146
I mean, pending a-a good meeting
with the director,

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,756
:
I-I got the part.

10
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,368
I have a strong feeling
about you guys.

11
00:00:29,159 --> 00:00:31,944
I'’m never leaving this bed.

12
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:33,772
You cannot make me.

13
00:00:33,946 --> 00:00:36,297
I think I got...

14
00:00:36,471 --> 00:00:39,343
maybe two hours of sleep?

15
00:00:39,517 --> 00:00:42,955
What? You got two whole hours?

16
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:44,827
-Who are you?

17
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:49,658
I'’m so tired, I can't even
remember the name of the guy

18
00:00:49,832 --> 00:00:53,662
from the fairy tale,
the one who sleeps for too long.

19
00:00:53,836 --> 00:00:55,838
Something...

20
00:00:56,012 --> 00:00:58,058
Something Von Something?

21
00:00:58,232 --> 00:01:00,321
Hey, we-we can'’t
keep doing this.

22
00:01:00,495 --> 00:01:04,107
Miguel and Shelly said
we just got to let Kevin

23
00:01:04,281 --> 00:01:05,804
cry himself to sleep.

24
00:01:05,978 --> 00:01:08,416
I know, I know, I know.

25
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,811
Maybe we just, maybe we just
give it one more night?

26
00:01:12,985 --> 00:01:16,467
Babe, we'’ve been saying that
for months.

27
00:01:16,641 --> 00:01:19,818
Look, how is Kevin gonna
teach himself to sleep

28
00:01:19,992 --> 00:01:22,038
if every time he cries, we're
just, we're rushing in there

29
00:01:22,212 --> 00:01:24,736
-to pick him up?
-Rip Van Winkle.

30
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:28,566
Rip Van Winkle, that's the name
of the guy from the fairy tale

31
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,568
-I couldn't remember.
-Babe?

32
00:01:30,742 --> 00:01:32,570
-What?
-Tonight'’s the night.

33
00:01:33,484 --> 00:01:35,617
Tonight we let him cry it out.

34
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:38,185
Okay?

35
00:01:41,362 --> 00:01:45,192
Okay. Tonight'’s the night.

36
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:48,673
Hmm.

37
00:01:54,331 --> 00:01:56,681
I got it. I got it.

38
00:01:56,855 --> 00:01:58,553
You stay and take a nap.

39
00:02:13,742 --> 00:02:15,961
Kevin is going
to literally explode.

40
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,269
Coach says to bulk up,
I have to eat 50 eggs a week.

41
00:02:19,443 --> 00:02:22,142
"Nobody can eat 50 eggs."

42
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:24,840
Cool Hand Luke?

43
00:02:26,058 --> 00:02:29,192
Only one of the greatest movies
of all-- Tough room.

44
00:02:29,366 --> 00:02:30,672
Tough room.

45
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,067
-You okay, Kev?
Yeah, I...

46
00:02:35,242 --> 00:02:36,547
woke up early
to work out with Dad,

47
00:02:36,721 --> 00:02:38,593
and I was up late
memorizing the playbook.

48
00:02:38,767 --> 00:02:41,639
Okay, well,
just don'’t push it, bud.

49
00:02:41,813 --> 00:02:43,424
When I have to memorize stuff
for a test,

50
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:45,252
I use rainbow flash cards.

51
00:02:45,426 --> 00:02:47,558
The different colors help your
brain retrieve the information.

52
00:02:47,732 --> 00:02:49,125
Ah, that'’s really cool.

53
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:50,909
-It is?
-No, you dork.

54
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:52,607
It'’s totally lame,
like everything else you do.

55
00:02:52,781 --> 00:02:54,609
Kev, don'’t knock it, all right?

56
00:02:54,783 --> 00:02:57,307
That is a straight-A system
that Randall'’s got right there.

57
00:02:57,481 --> 00:02:59,004
All right, school time.
Let's go, guys.

58
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,484
Finish up.
Get your book bags, okay?

59
00:03:00,658 --> 00:03:01,920
-Let's go.
Can you grab him...?

60
00:03:02,094 --> 00:03:03,574
Yeah, no, I got it. Kev,

61
00:03:03,748 --> 00:03:04,923
I'm gonna pick you up
after football today.

62
00:03:05,097 --> 00:03:06,621
Wait. Lunches, Kev.

63
00:03:06,795 --> 00:03:08,579
Randall, Bug.

64
00:03:08,753 --> 00:03:10,842
Thanks.

65
00:03:11,016 --> 00:03:12,844
-Jack.
-Yeah.

66
00:03:13,018 --> 00:03:15,282
Kevin is totally exhausted.

67
00:03:15,456 --> 00:03:16,457
Of course he'’s exhausted.
He'’s working hard

68
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:18,067
at something that he loves.

69
00:03:18,241 --> 00:03:20,461
Babe, it's-it's the best kind
of exhausted.

70
00:03:22,767 --> 00:03:24,552
See you in a bit.

71
00:03:28,033 --> 00:03:29,426
-Kevin.
Ava.

72
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,254
-Oh, my God, hi.
-Hi.

73
00:03:31,428 --> 00:03:33,778
It's so good to finally meet you
in person. This is great.

74
00:03:33,952 --> 00:03:35,389
I got to tell you,
I'’m beyond thrilled to finally

75
00:03:35,563 --> 00:03:37,695
-get to work with you.
-Thank you. Me, too.

76
00:03:37,869 --> 00:03:40,045
You know what? I'm a little
nervous to meet Foster.

77
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,786
I-- his last film, right?

78
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,005
I-I thought it was the greatest
thing I'd seen all year.

79
00:03:43,179 --> 00:03:44,746
Me, too. I'’m obsessed.

80
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,226
-I'’ve seen it
at least ten times.
-Right?

81
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,228
I have to ask,
are we supposed to call him

82
00:03:48,402 --> 00:03:50,273
Jordan Martin Foster
or just Foster?

83
00:03:50,447 --> 00:03:51,666
I have no-- I-I'’ve heard both.

84
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,754
-Yeah.
-I don't know what he likes.

85
00:03:52,928 --> 00:03:54,321
We'll just feel it out, I guess.

86
00:03:54,495 --> 00:03:57,149
-We'll find out.
Hey, guys.

87
00:03:57,324 --> 00:03:59,151
-Hey.
-Thank you for doing
all the quarantining

88
00:03:59,326 --> 00:04:01,284
and testing.

89
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,243
-Oh, I'll text you
when we're done.
Okay, thanks.

90
00:04:03,417 --> 00:04:05,767
-See you later.
Thank you.

91
00:04:05,941 --> 00:04:07,116
Ava.

92
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,684
-Hi.
-Oh, my God.

93
00:04:09,858 --> 00:04:12,382
I am so glad that you agreed
to do this film.

94
00:04:12,556 --> 00:04:15,864
I told the producer,
I said, "If Ava says no,

95
00:04:16,038 --> 00:04:18,040
"I'’m not doing it either,
'cause there would literally

96
00:04:18,214 --> 00:04:19,781
be no point."

97
00:04:19,955 --> 00:04:22,262
Oh, my God,
ten pages into the script,

98
00:04:22,436 --> 00:04:24,873
I called my agent and I was
like, "I have to do this film.

99
00:04:25,047 --> 00:04:26,178
I have to."

100
00:04:26,353 --> 00:04:29,486
-So, thank you.

101
00:04:31,096 --> 00:04:33,011
Yeah, I just...
I feel the same way.

102
00:04:33,185 --> 00:04:34,883
You know? After your first film,

103
00:04:35,057 --> 00:04:37,538
I thought, you know, any role
this guy wants me to play,

104
00:04:37,712 --> 00:04:39,583
I will do it, let alone
a character like this.

105
00:04:39,757 --> 00:04:41,846
You know, so complex, right?

106
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,371
-Unpredictable in a movie...
-Film.

107
00:04:45,372 --> 00:04:47,852
Uh, it'’s a film.

108
00:04:48,026 --> 00:04:49,593
Anyway,

109
00:04:49,767 --> 00:04:51,552
let'’s dig into the script,
shall we?

110
00:04:51,726 --> 00:04:53,205
Uh, I would like to start

111
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,033
with the two-hander scene
between you guys,

112
00:04:55,207 --> 00:04:58,733
starting on page eight.

113
00:05:00,691 --> 00:05:03,433
-Are you sure?
-I'’m sure.

114
00:05:03,607 --> 00:05:05,305
'Cause once we sign
these papers...

115
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:07,916
Babe, it'’s a birth plan,
it's not a deal with the devil.

116
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,484
Okay? Either party
can change their mind

117
00:05:10,658 --> 00:05:12,486
-at any time.
-Yeah, don'’t remind me.

118
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,445
We are totally
at Ellie'’s mercy here,

119
00:05:15,619 --> 00:05:17,142
until the baby is born.

120
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:20,320
Even after the baby is born,
we are at Ellie's mercy.

121
00:05:20,494 --> 00:05:22,365
Until she signs
the relinquishment papers,

122
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:23,888
we are completely at Ellie'’s...

123
00:05:24,062 --> 00:05:25,977
-mercy.
-Mercy. I know. I know, Tobe.

124
00:05:26,151 --> 00:05:29,241
Well, Ellie is going
to her ob-gyn appointment today

125
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:32,244
and only one person can go,
and she asked me to come,

126
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:36,031
so, I don't know, that'’s got
to be a-a good sign, right?

127
00:05:36,205 --> 00:05:39,643
Yes. Yes.

128
00:05:39,817 --> 00:05:41,732
Why do we call it an ob-gyn?

129
00:05:41,906 --> 00:05:44,126
We don'’t call
a cardiologist a C-A-R-D

130
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,085
or a dermatologist a D-E-R-M.

131
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:50,611
Okay, uh, will Serious Toby

132
00:05:50,785 --> 00:05:52,700
be watching the ultrasound
on FaceTime?

133
00:05:52,874 --> 00:05:58,836
Or will Funny Toby miss seeing
Baby Chloe for the first time?

134
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:01,143
Baby Chloe?

135
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,364
So, have we decided
to go with that name?

136
00:06:05,147 --> 00:06:07,149
I think we have.

137
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,979
Serious Toby is very excited.

138
00:06:11,153 --> 00:06:13,547
It'’s just hard to tell
because he'’s so serious.

139
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:15,679
Okay.

140
00:06:17,159 --> 00:06:19,640
Mother, can we please go
to the salon today?

141
00:06:19,814 --> 00:06:21,598
-My hair is a fright.
A fright?

142
00:06:21,772 --> 00:06:24,209
Mom, I told you not to let her
watch Little Womenagain.

143
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,996
Okay. Politician'’s dilemma:
solid versus striped.

144
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,738
Solid says I stand
by my convictions.

145
00:06:30,912 --> 00:06:33,871
Hmm. Striped says I represent
my entire community.

146
00:06:34,045 --> 00:06:36,004
It'’s very cute, you want
to look nice for your protégé.

147
00:06:36,178 --> 00:06:39,486
Honey, I prefer to think of him
as my apprentice.

148
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,009
Thank you.

149
00:06:43,011 --> 00:06:44,404
Hey, Dej.

150
00:06:45,317 --> 00:06:47,015
Big day today.

151
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:49,060
Of all the people that Malik
could have asked to shadow

152
00:06:49,234 --> 00:06:52,673
at work for his school project,
who did he choose?

153
00:06:52,847 --> 00:06:56,459
Hint: his name rhymes
with Gandall Gearson,

154
00:06:56,633 --> 00:06:58,156
and he'’s your gather...

155
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,984
It'’s a civics assignment,

156
00:07:00,158 --> 00:07:03,161
and you'’re the only city
councilman in his COVID pod.

157
00:07:03,335 --> 00:07:05,381
-Who else is he gonna ask?
-Your father and your boyfriend

158
00:07:05,555 --> 00:07:07,688
spending
the entire day together.

159
00:07:07,862 --> 00:07:09,864
-What could go wrong?

160
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:12,257
You'’re enjoying this
way too much.

161
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,390
Something is wrong with you.

162
00:07:16,348 --> 00:07:18,176
Hey, Malik.
Hey, Mrs. Pearson.

163
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,482
-Nice suit.
-Thank you.

164
00:07:19,656 --> 00:07:21,005
Ooh.

165
00:07:21,179 --> 00:07:23,486
8:06.
Thought we said 8:00 sharp.

166
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,663
-Oh. I-I'’m sorry,
Mr. Pearson. I'm...
-I'’m just messing with you, man.

167
00:07:26,837 --> 00:07:28,752
Striped. It's a good call.

168
00:07:28,926 --> 00:07:31,538
And, look, thank you again
for letting me do this.

169
00:07:31,712 --> 00:07:33,017
You know, I'’ve lived
in Philly my whole life,

170
00:07:33,191 --> 00:07:34,671
so I am excited to see
how the city runs.

171
00:07:34,845 --> 00:07:36,717
Malik, it'’s my pleasure.

172
00:07:37,544 --> 00:07:40,068
It's my pleasure.

173
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,071
Okay, a couple things.
-Mm-hmm?

174
00:07:43,245 --> 00:07:46,422
Don'’t talk about us, okay?
Don'’t talk about me.

175
00:07:46,596 --> 00:07:48,468
Don'’t talk about you.

176
00:07:48,642 --> 00:07:51,209
Actually,
just don'’t talk at all.

177
00:07:51,383 --> 00:07:54,212
And good luck or whatever.

178
00:07:54,386 --> 00:07:56,127
You look good in that suit.

179
00:07:56,301 --> 00:07:59,217
Okay, we are now officially
seven minutes behind schedule.

180
00:07:59,391 --> 00:08:01,437
That is seven minutes of
problems that don'’t get solved

181
00:08:01,611 --> 00:08:03,265
because you were late, Malik.
Let'’s not make it eight.

182
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:05,354
Hey, yo, yo, yo.

183
00:08:05,528 --> 00:08:08,270
Gandall Gearson gout.

184
00:08:18,976 --> 00:08:21,805
:
Kate and Randall are down.

185
00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:23,894
Yeah. Kevin, too, finally.

186
00:08:24,068 --> 00:08:26,767
He fell asleep in my arms
and then I managed

187
00:08:26,941 --> 00:08:29,770
to slide him into his crib
without waking him up.

188
00:08:29,944 --> 00:08:31,902
-It was a real pro move.
-Such a pro move.

189
00:08:32,076 --> 00:08:33,817
-Yeah.
-Such a pro move.

190
00:08:37,342 --> 00:08:39,867
-Oof.

191
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,738
Yeah, I should make sure
that he's in an okay position.

192
00:08:41,912 --> 00:08:43,697
No, babe, babe, babe, come on.

193
00:08:43,871 --> 00:08:47,135
W-We agreed we got to give him
a chance to calm himself down.

194
00:08:48,005 --> 00:08:50,268
-He'’ll stop.

195
00:08:51,313 --> 00:08:53,533
-He'll stop.

196
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,321
How was practice?

197
00:08:59,495 --> 00:09:00,888
Fine.

198
00:09:05,675 --> 00:09:06,676
Hey, hey.

199
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,635
-Oh, hey, Coach.
-Hey.

200
00:09:08,809 --> 00:09:10,419
-How you doing?
It's good to see you.
-Good to see you.

201
00:09:10,593 --> 00:09:11,855
-Yeah.
-Good to see you.
Hey, I, wanted to, uh,

202
00:09:12,029 --> 00:09:13,901
I wanted to clear something up.

203
00:09:14,075 --> 00:09:16,773
I didn'’t expect the
boys to actually eat 50 eggs.

204
00:09:16,947 --> 00:09:18,906
It'’s a line from a movie.

205
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,516
Well, it sounds like
what we'’ve got here

206
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,474
is a failure to communicate.

207
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:24,215
Ah. Clearly a man
who knows his movies.

208
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:25,782
Yeah.

209
00:09:25,956 --> 00:09:28,698
We did have some bumps
on the field today.

210
00:09:28,872 --> 00:09:31,919
-Kevin hasn'’t got
the playbook down.
-Really?

211
00:09:32,093 --> 00:09:36,053
Well, he-he'’s been
studying real hard.

212
00:09:36,227 --> 00:09:38,142
Well, to be honest,
Kev'’s probably not

213
00:09:38,316 --> 00:09:39,840
my biggest fan
right now, eh, Kevin?

214
00:09:40,014 --> 00:09:42,320
I was riding him
pretty hard out there today.

215
00:09:42,494 --> 00:09:44,322
He'’s got something special,
no doubt,

216
00:09:44,496 --> 00:09:46,020
but he'’s got to be willing
to put in the work.

217
00:09:46,194 --> 00:09:48,152
I have kids with half his talent
running drills

218
00:09:48,326 --> 00:09:50,285
seven days a week.

219
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:52,461
My son is up for it.

220
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:53,984
Glad to hear it.

221
00:09:54,158 --> 00:09:55,769
Allegheny College
has a weekend QB camp

222
00:09:55,943 --> 00:09:58,162
for seventh and eighth graders
right up in Meadville.

223
00:09:58,336 --> 00:10:00,251
Kev would be a great fit.

224
00:10:00,425 --> 00:10:02,210
But if I'’m gonna recommend him
for a spot...

225
00:10:02,384 --> 00:10:05,474
-He's got to put the work in.
-He needs to earn it. Yes, sir.

226
00:10:05,648 --> 00:10:07,302
He will. Right, Kevin?

227
00:10:08,172 --> 00:10:09,913
-Right.
Thanks, Jack.

228
00:10:10,087 --> 00:10:12,873
Yeah.
-I'll see you later, sport.

229
00:10:18,922 --> 00:10:20,750
You got yourself
into some trouble.

230
00:10:20,924 --> 00:10:23,187
I didn'’t get myself
into anything.

231
00:10:23,361 --> 00:10:26,408
Okay. Why'd they call me?

232
00:10:26,582 --> 00:10:28,279
To be honest, I have no idea.

233
00:10:28,453 --> 00:10:30,804
-"To be honest"?
-Yeah.

234
00:10:32,414 --> 00:10:34,895
Here's the thing,
when somebody says

235
00:10:35,069 --> 00:10:38,202
"To be honest" or
"If I'’m being honest with you"

236
00:10:38,376 --> 00:10:40,161
or "Honestly,"

237
00:10:40,335 --> 00:10:42,206
it usually means they'’re
about ready to lie to you.

238
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,208
Okay, let's, let'’s hold there,

239
00:10:44,382 --> 00:10:46,602
for a second.

240
00:10:46,776 --> 00:10:49,126
Ava, excellent.

241
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,476
You are giving him
as little as possible,

242
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:55,742
but you'’re giving me
everything that I need.

243
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:58,832
And... okay.

244
00:10:59,006 --> 00:11:01,356
Let'’s just take it back
to the top of the scene.

245
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:04,359
Okay.

246
00:11:04,533 --> 00:11:07,884
Yeah. Sure, okay.

247
00:11:10,104 --> 00:11:12,889
Got yourself into some trouble.

248
00:11:13,063 --> 00:11:14,630
I didn'’t get myself
into anything.

249
00:11:14,804 --> 00:11:16,110
So why'd they call me?

250
00:11:16,284 --> 00:11:19,809
To be honest, I have no idea.

251
00:11:19,983 --> 00:11:21,724
-"To be honest."
-Yeah.

252
00:11:21,898 --> 00:11:23,291
Hang-hang, hang on.

253
00:11:23,465 --> 00:11:26,250
-Kevin.
-Uh-huh?

254
00:11:26,424 --> 00:11:28,383
Just, just take it back
a couple lines.

255
00:11:28,557 --> 00:11:31,386
Sure. Sure.

256
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,873
So why'd they call me?

257
00:11:40,047 --> 00:11:42,527
-To be honest, I have no idea.
-"To be honest."

258
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:43,877
Yeah.
-One more time?

259
00:11:48,533 --> 00:11:50,231
Then why'd they call me?

260
00:11:50,405 --> 00:11:52,842
To be honest,
I have no idea.
-"To be honest"?

261
00:11:53,016 --> 00:11:54,975
-Can I get that last line again?
-You know, I just-- if you want
to give me a specific detail...

262
00:11:55,149 --> 00:11:56,106
No, no. Stay in the scene,
please stay...

263
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,194
I'’m trying to stay in the scene,

264
00:11:57,368 --> 00:11:59,327
but you keep... interrupting me.

265
00:11:59,501 --> 00:12:03,940
Believe me, Kevin, I wish
I didn'’t have to interrupt.

266
00:12:05,812 --> 00:12:07,335
:
Good to... All right.

267
00:12:09,337 --> 00:12:11,905
All right.

268
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,604
Um, just from the same...
s... pickup.

269
00:12:15,778 --> 00:12:17,867
Um...

270
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:20,522
We'’re hearing from a lot
of renters about evictions,

271
00:12:20,696 --> 00:12:23,003
but we'’re also getting a lot
of complaints from landlords

272
00:12:23,177 --> 00:12:24,569
-about delinquent rents.
Yeah.

273
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,397
Let'’s finalize the language

274
00:12:26,571 --> 00:12:29,705
on our motion
and get it to the council.

275
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:31,751
All right.

276
00:12:34,797 --> 00:12:35,798
We keeping you up, Malik?

277
00:12:35,972 --> 00:12:37,539
No. Sorry.

278
00:12:37,713 --> 00:12:38,801
Oh, unfortunately,
I won't be able to shoot

279
00:12:38,975 --> 00:12:40,498
your livestream today.

280
00:12:40,672 --> 00:12:42,631
I'’ve got a budget meeting
at the same time.

281
00:12:42,805 --> 00:12:46,113
All right. We livestream
a daily community bulletin.

282
00:12:46,287 --> 00:12:49,290
I cover local news and answer
questions from constituents.

283
00:12:49,464 --> 00:12:51,596
Oh, yeah, I know. That's
the one Deja watches every day.

284
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,860
She watches every day?

285
00:12:54,686 --> 00:12:55,949
I am a dead man

286
00:12:56,123 --> 00:12:57,864
-for telling you that.
-Oh, definitely.

287
00:12:58,038 --> 00:13:01,171
Better call your lawyer
and draw up a will.

288
00:13:01,345 --> 00:13:03,086
Hey, Malik.

289
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,567
How would you like to cover
the bulletin today?

290
00:13:05,741 --> 00:13:07,569
Me?
-Yeah.

291
00:13:07,743 --> 00:13:10,137
You'’re one of the more capable
young humans I'’ve met.

292
00:13:10,311 --> 00:13:11,791
We'’ll set you up at a desk
outside and you just have

293
00:13:11,965 --> 00:13:13,967
to make sure the livestream
starts and ends on cue.

294
00:13:14,141 --> 00:13:16,099
-Sound good?
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

295
00:13:16,273 --> 00:13:18,058
-For sure. I'’m on it.
Thank you, Malik.

296
00:13:18,232 --> 00:13:19,886
Uh, let'’s just make sure
to get a camera angle

297
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,975
that doesn't go
right up his nose.

298
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:23,367
I don'’t need to be reminded,
Jae-won.

299
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:24,542
I read all the comments.

300
00:13:24,716 --> 00:13:26,240
Never read the comments!

301
00:13:29,112 --> 00:13:31,114
This probably sounds insane,
but did you ever wonder

302
00:13:31,288 --> 00:13:33,203
what the ultrasound jelly
tastes like?

303
00:13:33,377 --> 00:13:34,683
Yes.

304
00:13:34,857 --> 00:13:35,684
Every time that we'’re here.

305
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:37,077
I know.

306
00:13:37,251 --> 00:13:38,730
Oh, uh, speaking of eating,

307
00:13:38,905 --> 00:13:40,167
Ellie, do you think you maybe

308
00:13:40,341 --> 00:13:41,821
want to have lunch with me
after this?

309
00:13:41,995 --> 00:13:43,953
Yeah, I'’d love to.

310
00:13:44,127 --> 00:13:45,563
Okay.

311
00:13:45,737 --> 00:13:46,521
Here she is.

312
00:13:46,695 --> 00:13:47,870
Looking great.

313
00:13:48,044 --> 00:13:50,046
Heartbeat is strong.

314
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,005
There she is.

315
00:13:53,702 --> 00:13:55,399
There'’s Chloe.

316
00:14:08,238 --> 00:14:10,153
-Well, it's a good thing

317
00:14:10,327 --> 00:14:12,112
-Randall and Kate
are such heavy sleepers, huh?

318
00:14:12,286 --> 00:14:14,027
This-this-this isn'’t
normal crying, Jack.

319
00:14:14,201 --> 00:14:15,593
He'’s never cried
like this before.

320
00:14:15,767 --> 00:14:17,639
Maybe something'’s wrong.
Maybe he'’s hurt.

321
00:14:17,813 --> 00:14:19,597
Miguel and Shelly said he's...

322
00:14:19,771 --> 00:14:21,512
Enough with Miguel and Shelly.

323
00:14:21,686 --> 00:14:23,732
Who made them experts, anyway?
Their kids are train wrecks!

324
00:14:25,647 --> 00:14:27,170
What's so funny?

325
00:14:27,344 --> 00:14:29,303
That'’s, that's the sound
of our son

326
00:14:29,477 --> 00:14:31,218
being emotionally traumatized
for life.

327
00:14:31,392 --> 00:14:32,872
Rebecca, do you remember
this morning when we said,

328
00:14:33,046 --> 00:14:35,178
"Tonight'’s the night"?
We held hands and...

329
00:14:35,352 --> 00:14:37,006
Yeah, I-I don'’t care
what I said this morning,

330
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,921
because I didn'’t know then
that he'’d be crying

331
00:14:39,095 --> 00:14:41,054
like a maniac for a half hour.

332
00:14:42,011 --> 00:14:43,578
It'’s been six minutes.

333
00:14:43,752 --> 00:14:45,275
-No way.
-Mm-hmm.

334
00:14:45,449 --> 00:14:47,016
-What?
-Look, I know this hurts.

335
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:49,932
I know it hurts, babe,
but, but don'’t you want him

336
00:14:50,106 --> 00:14:52,935
to show that crib who'’s boss?

337
00:14:53,109 --> 00:14:55,111
No. I don'’t care.

338
00:14:55,285 --> 00:14:57,461
I'm sorry,
I have to go in there.

339
00:15:01,161 --> 00:15:04,468
-Hi.
Hey.

340
00:15:06,862 --> 00:15:08,037
Is everything all right?

341
00:15:08,211 --> 00:15:09,430
Yeah, just a few bumps

342
00:15:09,604 --> 00:15:11,084
at practice.

343
00:15:11,258 --> 00:15:12,215
But we'’ll run some drills
after dinner,

344
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:13,564
I'll find the problems.

345
00:15:13,738 --> 00:15:15,697
I just got home
from practice, Dad.

346
00:15:15,871 --> 00:15:17,525
It'’s fine, Kev,
you can take the night off.

347
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:20,397
No, he can'’t, okay?
The coach said the other kids...

348
00:15:20,571 --> 00:15:21,964
I don'’t care what Coach says.

349
00:15:27,187 --> 00:15:28,666
I'’m gonna quit.

350
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,841
-No.

351
00:15:30,016 --> 00:15:31,191
Kev, you'’re not gonna quit.

352
00:15:31,365 --> 00:15:33,193
All right?
You'’re the quarterback.

353
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:35,412
You made a commitment
to that team.

354
00:15:35,586 --> 00:15:38,807
You don't just quit the second
something starts to feel tough.

355
00:15:38,981 --> 00:15:41,288
Okay?

356
00:15:46,684 --> 00:15:49,035
I'm tired.

357
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,518
-You should have talked to me

358
00:15:54,692 --> 00:15:56,216
before making a decision
like that.

359
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:59,262
Wh-- You seriously want
to let him quit?

360
00:15:59,436 --> 00:16:00,960
After h-having one rough day?

361
00:16:01,134 --> 00:16:03,875
He'’s clearly miserable, okay?

362
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:06,269
I'm-I'’m gonna go up there
and tell him if he doesn't want

363
00:16:06,443 --> 00:16:07,444
to play anymore,
he doesn'’t have to.

364
00:16:07,618 --> 00:16:08,837
Rebecca, I'’m strongly asking you

365
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:10,360
not to do that.

366
00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:14,538
You about ready?

367
00:16:14,712 --> 00:16:16,584
I want to squeeze in
a quick jog after this.

368
00:16:16,758 --> 00:16:18,716
-Yeah, it's looking like
we're good to go.
-Great.

369
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:21,328
I will count you down
to start the livestream.

370
00:16:21,502 --> 00:16:23,591
And you just let the bulletin
play until you hear me say...

371
00:16:23,765 --> 00:16:25,723
: "Thank you
for your time, Philadelphia.

372
00:16:25,897 --> 00:16:27,160
We'’ll talk again tomorrow."

373
00:16:27,334 --> 00:16:29,249
Just get the hell
out of here, man.

374
00:16:29,423 --> 00:16:31,381
These are trucks
that can drive right in

375
00:16:31,555 --> 00:16:33,775
and set up safe,
clean testing sites...

376
00:16:33,949 --> 00:16:35,559
Dad's doing his bulletin.

377
00:16:35,733 --> 00:16:37,213
Uh, we're trying
different spots around town,

378
00:16:37,387 --> 00:16:39,520
so check my website
for an updated list.

379
00:16:40,477 --> 00:16:42,392
Food banks are starting
to see...

380
00:16:42,566 --> 00:16:44,568
-...bumps in need
as the weather changes.

381
00:16:44,742 --> 00:16:47,354
Donations are always
appreciated.

382
00:16:47,528 --> 00:16:49,530
But please know
that everyone in this office

383
00:16:49,704 --> 00:16:51,575
is working to make sure  that nobody in our community...

384
00:16:51,749 --> 00:16:53,490
Hey, Mom,
I'’m still at city hall.

385
00:16:53,664 --> 00:16:55,579
-I read every message...

386
00:16:55,753 --> 00:16:58,756
Uh, no, no, she-she was fine
this morning.

387
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,671
I know that folks
are struggling right now.

388
00:17:00,845 --> 00:17:05,850
Look, I-I left a teething ring
in the freezer.

389
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:11,160
At a time when my birth father
didn'’t have a family,

390
00:17:11,334 --> 00:17:13,597
this community was his family.

391
00:17:15,469 --> 00:17:17,688
When I'm having
a hard day at work

392
00:17:17,862 --> 00:17:20,865
or get frustrated that things
aren'’t moving fast enough,

393
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:25,044
I remind myself
that I am doing this for him.

394
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:29,831
I'’m doing this for William Hill.

395
00:17:30,005 --> 00:17:32,138
Because you all were his family.

396
00:17:32,312 --> 00:17:35,445
Which means
that you'’re my family, too.

397
00:17:37,273 --> 00:17:38,883
I'm not gonna cry today.

398
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,843
I know a lot of you like
to take bets on that, so...

399
00:17:43,236 --> 00:17:44,889
Thanks for your time,
Philadelphia.

400
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,761
We'’ll talk again tomorrow.

401
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,768
All right.

402
00:17:53,942 --> 00:17:55,813
-Yeah, no, okay. Listen, um...
Malik,
I'm gonna change

403
00:17:55,987 --> 00:17:57,380
-and go for that run.
-If she starts crying again,

404
00:17:57,554 --> 00:17:59,165
just give her some baby Tylenol.

405
00:17:59,339 --> 00:18:01,558
But remember to check
the dosage, please.

406
00:18:01,732 --> 00:18:03,865
I know you know.

407
00:18:06,215 --> 00:18:07,825
Uh, Beth?

408
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,393
Hold on, hon, I'’m just
in the middle of something.

409
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:13,179
Uh, o-okay, but Randall'’s
taking his clothes off

410
00:18:13,353 --> 00:18:15,659
in front of the whole city
of Philadelphia.

411
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:17,618
Mom? Dad's getting naked!

412
00:18:17,792 --> 00:18:19,272
What?

413
00:18:20,882 --> 00:18:24,538
Oh, my G--
Tess, call your father.

414
00:18:42,251 --> 00:18:43,557
He'’s not answering.

415
00:18:43,731 --> 00:18:45,080
Of course he can'’t see
his phone,

416
00:18:45,254 --> 00:18:47,038
he's too busy... dancing.

417
00:18:47,213 --> 00:18:48,736
Mm-mm, girl, that'’s not dancing.

418
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,390
I don'’t know what that is,
but that is not dancing.

419
00:18:50,564 --> 00:18:51,782
Mom, I want to watch.

420
00:18:51,956 --> 00:18:53,480
Hey, hey, hey.
Annie, you know what?

421
00:18:53,654 --> 00:18:55,134
There's some things
you can'’t unsee, baby,

422
00:18:55,308 --> 00:18:56,178
and this is one of them,
all right?

423
00:18:56,352 --> 00:18:57,832
All right, all right, bye.

424
00:18:58,006 --> 00:19:00,008
Love you.

425
00:19:03,098 --> 00:19:05,187
Hey, Dej, what's up?

426
00:19:08,712 --> 00:19:10,366
Sh...

427
00:19:16,633 --> 00:19:17,504
I know.

428
00:19:17,678 --> 00:19:19,332
I know. I just, I-I think

429
00:19:19,506 --> 00:19:21,290
he needed to know
that he wasn't alone.

430
00:19:21,464 --> 00:19:23,031
-That's all.

431
00:19:29,255 --> 00:19:30,560
He is a child.

432
00:19:30,734 --> 00:19:32,432
He is a child playing a game.

433
00:19:32,606 --> 00:19:34,608
It'’s supposed to be fun.

434
00:19:34,782 --> 00:19:36,914
-Here we go.
-Here we go what?

435
00:19:37,088 --> 00:19:39,090
You'’ve been doing this to him
his entire life.

436
00:19:39,265 --> 00:19:42,442
The second he starts to complain
about something being too hard,

437
00:19:42,616 --> 00:19:44,052
you let him off the hook.

438
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:46,663
Excuse me?

439
00:19:46,837 --> 00:19:49,579
Guitar lessons, uh, Boy Scouts.

440
00:19:49,753 --> 00:19:51,929
Oh, I'm sorry,
our-our six-year-old got tired

441
00:19:52,103 --> 00:19:55,106
of tying knots all day,
so I let him bail on Boy Scouts.

442
00:19:55,281 --> 00:19:56,630
Put me in mom jail.

443
00:19:56,804 --> 00:19:59,633
You just, you can be
really easy on him.

444
00:19:59,807 --> 00:20:03,376
And it'’s made him a little...

445
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:06,466
What? It's made him what?

446
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,423
Soft.

447
00:20:07,597 --> 00:20:10,426
It's made him soft.

448
00:20:22,699 --> 00:20:25,354
Hey, nerd, tell me how your
stupid rainbow system works.

449
00:20:25,528 --> 00:20:28,183
Very funny.
But whatever the trick is,

450
00:20:28,357 --> 00:20:29,837
I'’m not falling for it.

451
00:20:30,881 --> 00:20:32,666
For real.

452
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:42,284
I need your help.
I keep messing up the plays.

453
00:20:43,111 --> 00:20:44,504
Please?

454
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:54,731
Hey, Foster.

455
00:20:54,905 --> 00:20:58,996
Or, uh, Jordan Martin Foster
or JMF?

456
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:00,563
I don't know what-- I don't know
what you...

457
00:21:00,737 --> 00:21:02,478
I don't know
what you want to be called.

458
00:21:03,436 --> 00:21:05,525
Is that what
you waited around to ask me?

459
00:21:06,917 --> 00:21:09,833
No. No. I-I, um...

460
00:21:10,007 --> 00:21:11,748
: Uh, you were
pretty rough on me in there.

461
00:21:11,922 --> 00:21:13,620
You know? And I was, I was
just wondering if you had

462
00:21:13,794 --> 00:21:17,406
any specific feedback for me
so that I could, you know...

463
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:20,409
I want to give you
what you want, in the scene.

464
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:22,846
I didn't realize
you were the kind of guy

465
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,674
that needs an attaboy.

466
00:21:24,848 --> 00:21:28,287
-No, no, it's...
-Look, look, today

467
00:21:28,461 --> 00:21:30,941
I learned that
you are a good actor.

468
00:21:31,115 --> 00:21:34,423
And there's nothing wrong
with being a good actor.

469
00:21:34,597 --> 00:21:36,773
And when you die,
people will say,

470
00:21:36,947 --> 00:21:40,603
"Oh, yeah, I remember him.
He was good."

471
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:43,214
Or you could be
one of the greats.

472
00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:46,870
Now, here's the good news,
Kevin: you get to decide.

473
00:21:47,044 --> 00:21:51,135
Is today as close as you get
to greatness...

474
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,660
or do you come back tomorrow?

475
00:21:58,099 --> 00:21:59,883
See you tomorrow.

476
00:22:06,237 --> 00:22:07,761
Hey.

477
00:22:08,762 --> 00:22:10,329
Hey.

478
00:22:14,985 --> 00:22:18,293
Okay, I'm really, really scared
that I tanked it in there

479
00:22:18,467 --> 00:22:20,208
when I called the baby Chloe.

480
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:22,558
It was totally insensitive.

481
00:22:22,732 --> 00:22:24,473
You know, I can't even imagine

482
00:22:24,647 --> 00:22:26,432
the thousands of emotions
that you're feeling,

483
00:22:26,606 --> 00:22:29,391
and then I go naming her and...

484
00:22:29,565 --> 00:22:31,828
But, Ellie, are you...

485
00:22:32,002 --> 00:22:34,614
are you having second thoughts?

486
00:22:36,485 --> 00:22:39,053
Look, it...
caught me by surprise.

487
00:22:39,227 --> 00:22:41,577
The name.

488
00:22:41,751 --> 00:22:44,101
This is all a lot for me.

489
00:22:44,275 --> 00:22:46,887
Yeah, of course it is.

490
00:22:50,804 --> 00:22:53,894
Kate, I told you
that my husband died.

491
00:22:55,112 --> 00:22:57,027
We met in tenth grade.

492
00:22:57,201 --> 00:22:59,769
But it took him a long time
to ask me out.

493
00:22:59,943 --> 00:23:03,817
And even when he did,
it was going... slow.

494
00:23:03,991 --> 00:23:05,122
We barely kissed.

495
00:23:05,296 --> 00:23:06,994
So, one day we go to the beach,

496
00:23:07,168 --> 00:23:10,301
and I decide, you know what,
I'm just gonna take charge.

497
00:23:10,476 --> 00:23:13,827
And I pull my T-shirt off,
and I'm standing there

498
00:23:14,001 --> 00:23:17,787
in my cute bikini top, and he
is just staring at my chest,

499
00:23:17,961 --> 00:23:20,703
like, confused, and he's like,

500
00:23:20,877 --> 00:23:24,272
"Wait, you don't have a big
hairy birthmark on your chest

501
00:23:24,446 --> 00:23:26,187
in the shape of South America?"

502
00:23:26,361 --> 00:23:27,971
What?

503
00:23:28,145 --> 00:23:30,365
All year, his bio lab partner
had been telling him

504
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:32,498
these crazy stories about me.

505
00:23:32,672 --> 00:23:34,543
And the lab partner...

506
00:23:34,717 --> 00:23:37,198
her name was Chloe Penner.

507
00:23:37,372 --> 00:23:39,374
:
No.

508
00:23:39,548 --> 00:23:41,115
Yeah.

509
00:23:42,551 --> 00:23:43,944
Yeah.

510
00:23:44,118 --> 00:23:47,295
So look, you...
you deserve to name this baby

511
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:49,602
whatever you want.

512
00:23:49,776 --> 00:23:53,693
-But does it have to be Chloe?

513
00:24:02,049 --> 00:24:03,877
One time.

514
00:24:05,008 --> 00:24:07,533
I went out just one time...

515
00:24:07,707 --> 00:24:11,058
two years after Doug died.

516
00:24:15,236 --> 00:24:16,890
A few months ago, I...

517
00:24:17,064 --> 00:24:20,546
decided that
I couldn't have this baby,

518
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,766
and I made an appointment
to have an abortion.

519
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:27,988
And I got as far as
the parking lot at the clinic.

520
00:24:28,815 --> 00:24:31,034
And I know that some people
have very strong feelings

521
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:34,081
-about...
-I'm not judging you at all.

522
00:24:36,387 --> 00:24:38,128
For me...

523
00:24:38,302 --> 00:24:40,130
that wasn't the right choice.

524
00:24:40,304 --> 00:24:41,349
:
Yeah.

525
00:24:41,523 --> 00:24:44,700
So, am I having second thoughts?

526
00:24:45,527 --> 00:24:47,311
Yeah.

527
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:50,184
About pretty much
my entire life.

528
00:24:52,186 --> 00:24:54,754
Except this.

529
00:24:54,928 --> 00:24:57,452
Except you and Toby.

530
00:24:57,626 --> 00:24:59,802
About that I am sure.

531
00:24:59,976 --> 00:25:03,023
Hundred percent sure, Kate.

532
00:25:08,245 --> 00:25:11,292
Mr. Pearson, I am so...

533
00:25:11,466 --> 00:25:13,816
I am so sorry.

534
00:25:22,564 --> 00:25:24,827
I'm sure at your age...

535
00:25:25,001 --> 00:25:27,090
city hall's a bit boring.

536
00:25:27,264 --> 00:25:29,963
But you asked
to shadow me, Malik.

537
00:25:31,442 --> 00:25:34,097
The work we do here is serious.

538
00:25:34,271 --> 00:25:36,926
I expected you
to take it seriously.

539
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,755
Not show up late,
yawn your way through it,

540
00:25:39,929 --> 00:25:42,366
and forget to do
the most important part

541
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,108
of the one thing
I asked you to do.

542
00:25:45,282 --> 00:25:47,981
I know. I-I messed up.

543
00:25:48,155 --> 00:25:49,896
I did.

544
00:25:51,114 --> 00:25:52,899
But...

545
00:25:53,073 --> 00:25:56,642
Mr. Pearson, do you know what
time I had to be up this morning

546
00:25:56,816 --> 00:25:59,645
to get to your place
only six minutes late?

547
00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:04,301
4:30.

548
00:26:04,475 --> 00:26:07,478
I usually get up at 5:00,
so that I can make sure

549
00:26:07,653 --> 00:26:10,177
that I prepare all
of Janelle's meals for the day,

550
00:26:10,351 --> 00:26:13,006
do her laundry,
wash all her bottles,

551
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,530
all before she gets up at 6:00.

552
00:26:15,704 --> 00:26:17,793
Today I had to pack a lunch

553
00:26:17,967 --> 00:26:20,927
and iron my shirt, so 4:30.

554
00:26:22,058 --> 00:26:25,322
This stuff is not boring at all.

555
00:26:25,496 --> 00:26:28,587
But I have a daughter.

556
00:26:29,805 --> 00:26:32,503
What she needs...

557
00:26:32,678 --> 00:26:35,202
it always comes first.

558
00:26:36,246 --> 00:26:39,554
Even if that means making the
things that I want for myself

559
00:26:39,728 --> 00:26:41,861
that much harder.

560
00:26:48,563 --> 00:26:53,002
I was 17 when I lost my father.

561
00:26:53,176 --> 00:26:55,701
And I felt like I owed it
to my family

562
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:59,705
to make my dreams smaller.

563
00:27:00,531 --> 00:27:02,708
More practical.

564
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:05,580
But I was wrong.

565
00:27:05,754 --> 00:27:08,714
Listen to me when I say this.

566
00:27:08,888 --> 00:27:11,064
Do not make your dreams smaller.

567
00:27:11,238 --> 00:27:12,587
Make 'em bigger.

568
00:27:12,761 --> 00:27:15,372
Not in spite of your daughter.

569
00:27:15,546 --> 00:27:17,418
Forher.

570
00:27:22,118 --> 00:27:23,293
Uh...

571
00:27:23,467 --> 00:27:26,122
I-I appreciate that,
Mr. Pearson.

572
00:27:26,296 --> 00:27:28,124
I don't think
the size of my dreams

573
00:27:28,298 --> 00:27:30,344
need to be worried about,
though.

574
00:27:30,518 --> 00:27:31,867
I get straight A's.

575
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:33,869
I'm going to go
to an Ivy League college

576
00:27:34,043 --> 00:27:35,349
and major in business.

577
00:27:35,523 --> 00:27:37,046
Then I'm gonna go
to culinary school,

578
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,135
so that I can open up
the first restaurant

579
00:27:39,309 --> 00:27:42,225
in Philadelphia history
to get three Michelin stars.

580
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,488
Well, damn. Okay.

581
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:48,928
Seems like your dreams are of
the perfectly appropriate size.

582
00:27:50,756 --> 00:27:53,715
Wh-What I do need, though,

583
00:27:53,889 --> 00:27:57,545
is a killer internship

584
00:27:57,719 --> 00:27:59,808
for these college applications.

585
00:27:59,982 --> 00:28:03,812
I was thinking maybe city hall?

586
00:28:04,639 --> 00:28:06,380
I think that can be arranged.

587
00:28:06,554 --> 00:28:08,121
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

588
00:28:08,295 --> 00:28:10,427
You-you know Deja's gonna lose
her mind, right?

589
00:28:10,601 --> 00:28:13,430
-Oh, I'm counting on it, bruh.

590
00:28:24,354 --> 00:28:26,748
-No, no, no.
Out of my way, Jack.

591
00:28:26,922 --> 00:28:28,489
-Can't do that.

592
00:28:28,663 --> 00:28:30,230
What we're doing isn't working.

593
00:28:30,404 --> 00:28:33,450
I can't move from this door,
as much as I want to.

594
00:28:33,624 --> 00:28:35,104
Just...

595
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:36,758
a little longer.

596
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,556
All right, you ready?
Yeah.

597
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,733
-Uh, same ones?
-Same ones.

598
00:28:54,907 --> 00:28:57,387
Um, pro-right split,

599
00:28:57,561 --> 00:29:00,564
897 F motion right...

600
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:03,045
-option zone?
-You got it!

601
00:29:03,219 --> 00:29:05,004
-That's ten in a row.
-Yes.

602
00:29:05,178 --> 00:29:08,094
-Okay, let's do ten more.
-Okay.

603
00:29:14,143 --> 00:29:15,841
-Hey, Kev.

604
00:29:16,015 --> 00:29:17,973
Well, I had the worst first day with this new director.

605
00:29:18,147 --> 00:29:19,845
I feel like he put me in a bag

606
00:29:20,019 --> 00:29:21,542
and just beat me
with a baseball bat.

607
00:29:21,716 --> 00:29:23,239
Why would he put you in a bag?

608
00:29:23,413 --> 00:29:25,111
Why wouldn't he beat you up
outside of the bag?

609
00:29:25,285 --> 00:29:26,547
No, because when
you're in the bag,

610
00:29:26,721 --> 00:29:28,201
you don't know where
he's hitting you.

611
00:29:28,375 --> 00:29:29,855
You know, just random spots
all over the body.

612
00:29:30,029 --> 00:29:31,682
So you don't know where
the next blow's gonna land.

613
00:29:31,857 --> 00:29:33,510
Oof.

614
00:29:33,684 --> 00:29:35,991
I mean, are you sure working
with him is even worth it?

615
00:29:36,862 --> 00:29:39,342
Um, I don't know, maybe,
uh, I...

616
00:29:42,693 --> 00:29:45,087
I've been thinking a lot
about Mom, you know?

617
00:29:45,261 --> 00:29:47,307
She's-she's stuck out there
at that cabin.

618
00:29:47,481 --> 00:29:49,831
She's using her phone
to stay connected to the family,

619
00:29:50,005 --> 00:29:51,615
and I just thought...

620
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:56,011
how nice it would be
to do something really great.

621
00:29:56,185 --> 00:29:58,622
Like take her to the Oscars.

622
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,060
Or, like, to win an Oscar,
and then I could stand up

623
00:30:01,234 --> 00:30:02,670
in front of everyone
and just thank her

624
00:30:02,844 --> 00:30:04,150
for everything she did for me.

625
00:30:05,064 --> 00:30:08,589
I'd like to do that while she
can still remember, you know?

626
00:30:11,287 --> 00:30:15,161
First I got to give a
performance that's not so tired.

627
00:30:15,944 --> 00:30:17,076
Kev.

628
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,338
Hmm?

629
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,952
Kate, come on, I'm too tired
for subtext. Just tell me.

630
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,607
Your big fight with Randall--

631
00:30:26,781 --> 00:30:29,088
I mean, didn't he say
that your acting was tired?

632
00:30:29,262 --> 00:30:31,525
This has nothing to do
with Randall, Kate, all right?

633
00:30:31,699 --> 00:30:32,700
This has...

634
00:30:32,874 --> 00:30:34,963
nothing to do with him.

635
00:30:35,137 --> 00:30:37,705
You know, I had a...
conversation with him

636
00:30:37,879 --> 00:30:40,055
on, um, our birthday.

637
00:30:40,926 --> 00:30:43,406
And he said some things

638
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:46,148
that I just can't stop
thinking about.

639
00:30:46,322 --> 00:30:49,325
You know, ab-about
what it was like...

640
00:30:49,499 --> 00:30:53,590
as a black kid
growing up in our family

641
00:30:53,764 --> 00:30:55,331
with white parents,

642
00:30:55,505 --> 00:30:57,420
you know,
and-and white siblings and...

643
00:30:57,594 --> 00:31:00,510
how it must have felt for him,
and how unseen...

644
00:31:00,684 --> 00:31:02,164
-he felt.
-Unseen?

645
00:31:02,338 --> 00:31:04,340
Kate, Mom and Dad
were obsessed with Randall.

646
00:31:04,514 --> 00:31:06,429
All right? All we tried to do is
get five minutes a day with them

647
00:31:06,603 --> 00:31:08,605
when they weren't paying
attention to Randall.

648
00:31:08,779 --> 00:31:10,433
Kev...

649
00:31:10,607 --> 00:31:12,392
we don't even talk to him
about this stuff, though.

650
00:31:12,566 --> 00:31:14,960
You know? And we don'’t talk
to him about what it was like

651
00:31:15,134 --> 00:31:16,483
or-or what it's still like

652
00:31:16,657 --> 00:31:18,398
for him.

653
00:31:19,355 --> 00:31:20,487
Okay.

654
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,796
Look, I'm not an idiot, okay?

655
00:31:25,971 --> 00:31:27,450
I...

656
00:31:27,624 --> 00:31:29,583
I understand it probably wasn't
a walk in the park

657
00:31:29,757 --> 00:31:31,150
to be the only black kid

658
00:31:31,324 --> 00:31:32,891
in that fancy private school
he went to.

659
00:31:33,065 --> 00:31:34,544
But let's not sit here
and pretend

660
00:31:34,718 --> 00:31:36,895
that Mom and Dad
did anything wrong, okay?

661
00:31:38,157 --> 00:31:40,202
I'm just saying,
we all have stuff

662
00:31:40,376 --> 00:31:42,204
from our past that we're
still dealing with, okay?

663
00:31:42,378 --> 00:31:44,511
And that's Randall, you andme.

664
00:31:44,685 --> 00:31:47,166
What does that mean?

665
00:31:49,429 --> 00:31:51,126
Nothing.

666
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,215
Honestly, I'm just tired.

667
00:31:53,389 --> 00:31:55,652
It's been a really long day.

668
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:58,481
Honestly?

669
00:31:58,655 --> 00:32:01,267
Yeah. I'm fine.

670
00:32:10,189 --> 00:32:11,712
Hey, baby.

671
00:32:11,886 --> 00:32:14,280
Hey.

672
00:32:15,803 --> 00:32:17,239
Yeah. I'm not...

673
00:32:17,413 --> 00:32:19,111
I'm not ready
to laugh about it yet.

674
00:32:19,285 --> 00:32:20,590
Oh, no, not yet?
No.

675
00:32:20,764 --> 00:32:22,027
Okay, will you let me know
when you are?

676
00:32:22,201 --> 00:32:23,985
Because, um,
I have so much laughter

677
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:25,160
on the inside of me, I just...

678
00:32:25,334 --> 00:32:26,596
would like to get that out.

679
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:28,859
Appreciate it.

680
00:32:29,686 --> 00:32:33,647
Malik told me
about the internship.

681
00:32:33,821 --> 00:32:35,692
You're ruining my life.

682
00:32:35,866 --> 00:32:36,911
You know that, right?

683
00:32:37,085 --> 00:32:39,000
I do.

684
00:32:41,176 --> 00:32:43,396
Thank you.

685
00:32:49,793 --> 00:32:51,839
You gonna give that boy
an internship

686
00:32:52,013 --> 00:32:53,101
after what he did today?

687
00:32:53,275 --> 00:32:54,276
Look, after what happened today,

688
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:56,061
that kid will not allow himself

689
00:32:56,235 --> 00:32:57,279
to screw up again.

690
00:32:57,453 --> 00:32:59,499
Trust me. I was that kid.

691
00:33:01,544 --> 00:33:03,372
All right. As long as
his parents don't have

692
00:33:03,546 --> 00:33:04,939
-to come over for dinner.

693
00:33:05,113 --> 00:33:07,637
Excuse me.

694
00:33:07,811 --> 00:33:09,248
What up, Jae-won?

695
00:33:09,422 --> 00:33:11,598
Someone posted it.

696
00:33:11,772 --> 00:33:13,426
Today's, uh, bulletin.

697
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,429
And it's kind of going viral.

698
00:33:16,603 --> 00:33:18,561
Well, viral how?

699
00:33:18,735 --> 00:33:21,129
Your bulletins
usually get 5,000 views.

700
00:33:21,303 --> 00:33:24,437
This one
is already over 100,000.

701
00:33:24,611 --> 00:33:26,308
It might make the news tonight.

702
00:33:26,482 --> 00:33:29,877
And not just the local stations, either.

703
00:33:30,051 --> 00:33:31,270
Well, on the plus side,

704
00:33:31,444 --> 00:33:34,273
the camera angle's
very flattering.

705
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,322
You know, these ultrasounds,

706
00:33:40,496 --> 00:33:42,846
they look like somebody
made a baby out of wax

707
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:46,111
and then left it out
in the sun too long.

708
00:33:46,285 --> 00:33:49,114
But I think...

709
00:33:50,332 --> 00:33:52,595
I think I love
this melted wax baby.

710
00:33:52,769 --> 00:33:55,555
Whatever her name will be.

711
00:33:58,949 --> 00:34:00,864
What's up?

712
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,649
I thought you'd be excited

713
00:34:02,823 --> 00:34:06,218
knowing that Ellie
is fully on board.

714
00:34:07,262 --> 00:34:09,047
I'm fine.

715
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:17,533
Actually, I'm not fine at all.

716
00:34:19,231 --> 00:34:23,583
Um, my talk with Ellie today
brought up some stuff for me.

717
00:34:25,585 --> 00:34:29,676
Some stuff that I never wanted
to tell anyone.

718
00:34:30,851 --> 00:34:32,809
I mean, not my mom.

719
00:34:32,983 --> 00:34:35,464
Not my brothers.

720
00:34:35,638 --> 00:34:37,510
And not you.

721
00:34:43,646 --> 00:34:46,562
When I was 18,

722
00:34:46,736 --> 00:34:51,176
I was in a really,
really bad relationship.

723
00:34:59,314 --> 00:35:01,534
And when it ended...

724
00:35:06,234 --> 00:35:08,410
Come in.

725
00:35:09,846 --> 00:35:11,892
Are you sure
you don't want to come with us

726
00:35:12,066 --> 00:35:14,286
-to New York?
-Yep.

727
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,723
Molly's gonna come over,
and we're gonna hang out

728
00:35:16,897 --> 00:35:19,378
and make fun of Dawson's Creek.

729
00:35:19,552 --> 00:35:21,293
Have fun.

730
00:35:21,467 --> 00:35:24,644
-And tell Kevin I said congrats.
-All right.

731
00:35:25,514 --> 00:35:26,950
-Love you.
-Love you.

732
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,127
-Bye, sweetheart.
-Bye.

733
00:36:24,007 --> 00:36:27,185
Okay. Maybe you were right.

734
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:31,885
Maybe I am a little easy
on Kevin.

735
00:36:32,929 --> 00:36:34,496
Really? What changed?

736
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:37,456
Well, I just went upstairs
to talk to him,

737
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,284
and he was with Randall,

738
00:36:39,458 --> 00:36:42,200
who is helping him
memorize his playbook.

739
00:36:44,114 --> 00:36:45,246
Jack, they high-fived.

740
00:36:49,642 --> 00:36:52,079
It's just...
it's so hard for me to push them

741
00:36:52,253 --> 00:36:54,299
when they seem unhappy.

742
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,436
You know, my-my dad
had a nickname for me

743
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:03,133
-when I was a kid?
-Uh-uh.

744
00:37:03,308 --> 00:37:05,005
Jack of All Trades.

745
00:37:05,179 --> 00:37:07,703
-Hmm.
-I mean, I-I thought
that sounded so cool.

746
00:37:07,877 --> 00:37:10,184
You know, I-I thought that
that meant my dad thought

747
00:37:10,358 --> 00:37:12,926
I was great at everything.

748
00:37:14,971 --> 00:37:16,495
So, one day,

749
00:37:16,669 --> 00:37:19,541
I decide to try and fix
the leaky kitchen faucet,

750
00:37:19,715 --> 00:37:22,631
and I just couldn't do it.

751
00:37:22,805 --> 00:37:25,808
I couldn't figure it out.
And Stanley...

752
00:37:25,982 --> 00:37:28,071
He sneers at me,

753
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:30,857
and he says,
"Jack of All Trades,

754
00:37:31,031 --> 00:37:33,163
Master of None."

755
00:37:33,338 --> 00:37:35,557
And that's when I got it.

756
00:37:35,731 --> 00:37:37,516
The whole time, he'd been saying

757
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:39,735
I was great
at absolutely nothing.

758
00:37:39,909 --> 00:37:42,825
-Oh, Jack.
-No, it-it's fine.

759
00:37:42,999 --> 00:37:44,740
I'm an ordinary man.

760
00:37:44,914 --> 00:37:48,222
And for me,
the way my dad treated me,

761
00:37:48,396 --> 00:37:50,659
to get out of that house
an ordinary man,

762
00:37:50,833 --> 00:37:53,358
that is an accomplishment
in my book.

763
00:37:54,184 --> 00:37:56,186
But...

764
00:37:56,361 --> 00:37:58,232
Our kids,

765
00:37:58,406 --> 00:38:00,930
I want them

766
00:38:01,104 --> 00:38:05,065
to know their dad
sees greatness in them.

767
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:09,722
I will kill myself
to make them feel that way.

768
00:38:09,896 --> 00:38:11,854
Even when...

769
00:38:12,942 --> 00:38:16,555
Even when deep down,
I just want to hold my kid

770
00:38:16,729 --> 00:38:19,645
and-and tell him
to go take a nap.

771
00:38:21,516 --> 00:38:24,127
-Hey.

772
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,260
I feel sorry for your dad.

773
00:38:26,434 --> 00:38:28,436
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

774
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:30,960
To have had a son like you

775
00:38:31,134 --> 00:38:34,094
and to have not seen
what was right in front of him.

776
00:38:34,268 --> 00:38:37,315
Yeah.

777
00:38:39,404 --> 00:38:41,188
You really saw them high-five?

778
00:38:41,362 --> 00:38:42,581
Oh, yeah.

779
00:38:42,755 --> 00:38:44,060
You sure they weren't just,
like,

780
00:38:44,234 --> 00:38:45,540
trying to smack each other
in the face?

781
00:38:45,714 --> 00:38:48,935
-Like, at the same time?
-: No.

782
00:38:58,161 --> 00:39:00,468
You really do this
every time you take a test?

783
00:39:00,642 --> 00:39:03,471
That must take forever.

784
00:39:03,645 --> 00:39:06,387
It does. But being me

785
00:39:06,561 --> 00:39:08,955
at my school,

786
00:39:09,129 --> 00:39:11,087
I have to be the best.

787
00:40:16,283 --> 00:40:19,286
-When I'm having
a hard day at work

788
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,157
or, uh, get frustrated

789
00:40:21,331 --> 00:40:23,072
that things
aren't moving fast enough,

790
00:40:23,246 --> 00:40:26,336
I remind myself
that I'm doing this for him.

791
00:40:27,903 --> 00:40:30,428
I'm doing this for William Hill.

792
00:40:30,602 --> 00:40:32,691
-...I'm doing this for him.

793
00:40:34,475 --> 00:40:35,824
I'm doing this for William Hill.

794
00:40:38,914 --> 00:40:42,004
I'm doing this for William Hill.

795
00:40:43,484 --> 00:40:45,660
Because you all were his family.

796
00:40:47,314 --> 00:40:49,185
Which means
you're my family, too.

797
