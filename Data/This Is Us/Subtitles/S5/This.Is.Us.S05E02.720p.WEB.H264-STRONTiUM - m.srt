Wait, someone's at the door.

00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:46,477
No, it's just Kevin and Madison.

15
00:00:46,562 --> 00:00:48,252
Oh, well, hello to you, too.

16
00:00:48,426 --> 00:00:50,341
Um, will you just keep looking?

17
00:00:50,515 --> 00:00:52,125
Just... I'll call you
if I hear anything.

18
00:00:52,299 --> 00:00:53,562
Okay.

19
00:00:53,736 --> 00:00:55,781
- What's up?
- Oh, God.

20
00:00:56,328 --> 00:00:58,609
Mom went to get a birthday cake,
and she hasn't come back.

21
00:00:58,741 --> 00:01:00,757
I tried calling her.
She's not answering.

22
00:01:00,937 --> 00:01:02,494
So, Toby went to the bakery,

23
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:04,450
and apparently,
she didn't even make it there.

24
00:01:04,615 --> 00:01:06,578
- Oh, my God.
- Okay. I-I'm-I'm gonna go...

25
00:01:06,662 --> 00:01:08,144
I'm gonna go look for her.
I'm gonna go help.

26
00:01:08,228 --> 00:01:09,839
- Uh, are you okay?
- Yeah.

27
00:01:10,013 --> 00:01:11,057
- No, yeah, go.
- You sure?

28
00:01:11,231 --> 00:01:12,581
- Yeah.
- Wait, what's going on?

29
00:01:12,755 --> 00:01:14,629
Uh, no, nothing.
I had a little morning sickness,

30
00:01:14,713 --> 00:01:16,802
- but...
- Oh, thank God. Um...

31
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:17,796
Yes.

32
00:01:17,881 --> 00:01:20,257
Yes. Of course.

33
00:01:20,342 --> 00:01:22,321
Um, thank you very much.

34
00:01:22,406 --> 00:01:23,505
Yeah, we're here.

35
00:01:23,679 --> 00:01:25,507
Okay.

36
00:01:28,063 --> 00:01:29,680
S-So, the cops have her.

37
00:01:30,282 --> 00:01:33,188
She, uh... She had an episode.

38
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,284
They're bringing her back here.

39
00:01:36,822 --> 00:01:38,476
Let's all just, um...

40
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:39,961
Let's just stay calm.

41
00:01:40,179 --> 00:01:41,998
We don't know what kind of state
she's gonna be in,

42
00:01:42,082 --> 00:01:43,605
and-and I don't want
to panic her.

43
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,454
All right, ma'am, you're home.

44
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:52,193
Everything's gonna be okay.

45
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,798
Mom, come on in.

46
00:01:55,972 --> 00:01:57,452
- Hi.
- Hi.

47
00:01:57,626 --> 00:01:59,454
Thank you very much
for bringing her home.

48
00:02:05,982 --> 00:02:08,639
Okay, thanks.
Oh, how's she doing back there?

49
00:02:08,724 --> 00:02:10,118
Uh, she's laying down.

50
00:02:10,203 --> 00:02:11,901
She's a little nauseous.

51
00:02:11,986 --> 00:02:13,576
My fiancée's
got morning sickness

52
00:02:13,661 --> 00:02:14,738
at all hours of the day.

53
00:02:14,823 --> 00:02:16,999
Oh. Try ginger tea.

54
00:02:23,469 --> 00:02:25,428
- Hey.
- Madison okay?

55
00:02:25,513 --> 00:02:27,131
Yeah. Yeah, she's okay.

56
00:02:27,216 --> 00:02:29,218
- Did you hear anything from Mom's doctor?
- No.

57
00:02:29,303 --> 00:02:31,305
Miguel left her a message.

58
00:02:33,661 --> 00:02:34,924
Kev, she was...

59
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:37,294
she was gone.

60
00:02:37,387 --> 00:02:40,764
Like, like,
her face was not her face.

61
00:02:41,747 --> 00:02:42,779
I know.

62
00:02:42,864 --> 00:02:45,282
It's too soon.
I'm not ready for this.

63
00:02:46,283 --> 00:02:47,937
Yeah, me neither.

64
00:02:50,374 --> 00:02:52,279
Obviously, at some point,

65
00:02:52,364 --> 00:02:55,670
you're gonna need to explain
your use of the word "fiancée."

66
00:02:55,755 --> 00:02:57,041
Yeah, it's a long story.

67
00:02:57,137 --> 00:02:58,404
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

68
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:00,169
Well, it's a long car ride home.

69
00:03:00,457 --> 00:03:02,633
True that. Yeah.

70
00:03:05,747 --> 00:03:08,438
Okay, so, Kev,
I tried calling you

71
00:03:08,523 --> 00:03:10,612
for, like, two hours,
and you weren't answering.

72
00:03:10,786 --> 00:03:13,136
I'm sorry.

73
00:03:26,488 --> 00:03:29,302
<font color=#FF00FF>"THIS IS US"</font>

75
00:03:33,896 --> 00:03:35,490
I didn't...
I didn't know you were, uh...

76
00:03:35,574 --> 00:03:36,967
Yeah.

77
00:03:37,682 --> 00:03:39,336
- Hey.
- Hey.

78
00:03:44,422 --> 00:03:45,472
Hi.

79
00:03:45,647 --> 00:03:47,170
Hey.

80
00:03:47,344 --> 00:03:49,999
I was just gonna call you
about Mom.

81
00:03:50,173 --> 00:03:51,743
The cops found her.
They brought her home,

82
00:03:51,827 --> 00:03:53,132
so she's-she's here.

83
00:03:53,217 --> 00:03:56,090
She's safe.
She's-she's resting, so...

84
00:04:01,053 --> 00:04:03,055
Well, I wish I could give you
a massive hug,

85
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:05,165
- but I don't know when you were...
- I'm-I'm good.

86
00:04:05,249 --> 00:04:07,994
I get COVID tested
three times a week at city hall.

87
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:10,734
Plus Beth's turned into Fauci
at home, so...

88
00:04:14,177 --> 00:04:15,396
You guys?

89
00:04:15,492 --> 00:04:17,236
Yeah, we're g...
We, um, we quarantined

90
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:20,290
for 20 days before we got here,
so we're all good. -

91
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:21,726
Okay.

92
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:23,884
I want to see her.

93
00:04:23,969 --> 00:04:25,946
- She upstairs? - Yeah.
- Yeah.

94
00:04:26,559 --> 00:04:28,605
Randall.

95
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:33,000
There's no way we could've known
this was gonna happen.

96
00:04:33,085 --> 00:04:35,655
She was great before this.
You can ask Kate.

97
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,477
I'm not questioning you, Kev.
I believe you.

98
00:04:38,735 --> 00:04:41,117
She's home,
and that's what matters.

99
00:04:41,222 --> 00:04:42,602
It's cool.

100
00:04:44,053 --> 00:04:45,438
Cool.

101
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:47,781
Oh, hey...

102
00:04:49,119 --> 00:04:50,947
Thank you for coming.

103
00:04:51,277 --> 00:04:53,281
I know the last thing
that you need right now is

104
00:04:53,366 --> 00:04:55,412
a terrified, panicked text
from your sister.

105
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:45,897
Randall.

106
00:05:46,071 --> 00:05:47,725
- What...
- Hey.

107
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:49,118
Sweetheart, I thought...

108
00:05:49,292 --> 00:05:51,120
I thought you weren't
gonna make it.

109
00:05:51,294 --> 00:05:53,296
What, you think I'd miss
our birthday?

110
00:05:53,381 --> 00:05:55,775
Oh...

111
00:05:58,431 --> 00:05:59,924
You know.

112
00:06:00,462 --> 00:06:02,822
- Kate called me.
- Mm.

113
00:06:04,742 --> 00:06:07,136
Are Beth and the girls
with you?

114
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,051
No, they're back home.

115
00:06:09,225 --> 00:06:11,009
Next time.

116
00:06:12,049 --> 00:06:14,099
I'm clear. Kev said
you are, too.

117
00:06:14,265 --> 00:06:15,614
I just want to be vigilant.

118
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:17,603
- Sit.
- Oh.

119
00:06:24,716 --> 00:06:26,849
You want to tell me
what happened?

120
00:06:28,635 --> 00:06:29,947
Mm...

121
00:06:31,736 --> 00:06:33,425
I, uh...

122
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:36,992
I don't even know what to say.

123
00:06:37,806 --> 00:06:40,865
Um, I went into town...

124
00:06:42,824 --> 00:06:45,400
...and then the next thing
I knew...

125
00:06:46,431 --> 00:06:49,736
William was there.

126
00:06:50,404 --> 00:06:53,314
I mean, obviously not William,
but I...

127
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:56,185
Oh, God, I could have sworn
it was him.

128
00:07:01,277 --> 00:07:04,584
I've been thinking about him
a lot lately.

129
00:07:07,065 --> 00:07:09,983
Ever since we had our
conversation about the trial,

130
00:07:10,068 --> 00:07:14,167
and about me, um...
keeping him from you.

131
00:07:14,252 --> 00:07:16,858
We don't have to talk about that
right now, Mom. That's...

132
00:07:19,382 --> 00:07:22,037
Well, then, when?

133
00:07:24,213 --> 00:07:25,736
Hmm?

134
00:07:28,391 --> 00:07:30,872
Wh-What's going on there?

135
00:07:31,046 --> 00:07:34,049
Oh, that's just some poison ivy.

136
00:07:34,223 --> 00:07:35,503
Miguel and I have been
gardening.

137
00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:37,226
I already took something
for it.

138
00:07:40,925 --> 00:07:43,536
Do you think this would have
happened in St. Louis?

139
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:46,409
I don't know.

140
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:51,718
- I'm sorry I pushed that on you.
- No.

141
00:07:51,893 --> 00:07:53,198
No, no, no, sweetheart.

142
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:56,245
You have nothing
to apologize for.

143
00:08:01,293 --> 00:08:03,905
Are Beth and the girls with you?

144
00:08:07,475 --> 00:08:09,564
No, Mom.

145
00:08:09,649 --> 00:08:11,651
- Uh, next time.
- Okay.

146
00:08:25,274 --> 00:08:28,712
Hey, excuse me, excuse me, um...

147
00:08:28,886 --> 00:08:30,279
My wife is Rebecca Pearson.

148
00:08:30,453 --> 00:08:32,672
I don't have an update yet, sir.

149
00:08:32,847 --> 00:08:35,458
Okay, wait, I-I don't...
I don't know what to do.

150
00:08:35,632 --> 00:08:39,114
Um, what can I do?

151
00:08:39,288 --> 00:08:41,507
You could pray.

152
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,909
Heh!

153
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:54,956
- What are you doing?
- Kevin, you need to talk to Randall.

154
00:08:57,349 --> 00:09:00,178
Kev, I have tried my best
to stay out of this,

155
00:09:00,352 --> 00:09:02,964
but now Randall's acting
all weird with me, too.

156
00:09:03,138 --> 00:09:05,009
We haven't even done
our birthday chant,

157
00:09:05,183 --> 00:09:06,315
and that's like canon.

158
00:09:06,489 --> 00:09:08,143
- Oh, Kate, Kate...
- No, Kevin.

159
00:09:08,317 --> 00:09:10,797
The world is on fire.

160
00:09:10,972 --> 00:09:14,497
This is enough. Fix it.

161
00:09:46,746 --> 00:09:48,226
Hey.

162
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,881
You know, after seeing
all those Internet videos

163
00:09:51,055 --> 00:09:53,449
of random objects
that are actually cakes,

164
00:09:53,631 --> 00:09:56,373
it's kind of a letdown
to have a cake that just...

165
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,353
looks like a cake.

166
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,940
You know...

167
00:10:06,114 --> 00:10:07,554
...when Rebecca and I
first got here,

168
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,609
we thought we were gonna
be here for a week.

169
00:10:09,977 --> 00:10:13,633
Two, max. Then that
turned into a month.

170
00:10:14,328 --> 00:10:15,819
Then two months.

171
00:10:16,563 --> 00:10:18,606
But...

172
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,737
she just kept feeling better.

173
00:10:22,565 --> 00:10:24,800
And I... I'm not an idiot
or anything like that.

174
00:10:24,885 --> 00:10:27,104
I know that
there's-there's no secret magic

175
00:10:27,284 --> 00:10:29,530
in the air
that's gonna cure this,

176
00:10:29,615 --> 00:10:31,878
but... she just seemed
like Rebecca again.

177
00:10:31,963 --> 00:10:33,312
You know?

178
00:10:35,099 --> 00:10:37,101
And now, with this...

179
00:10:37,275 --> 00:10:39,717
Oh, man. It's just
gonna take the legs

180
00:10:39,802 --> 00:10:41,978
right out from underneath her.

181
00:10:47,372 --> 00:10:50,158
Okay, I'm gonna try
to say something meaningful

182
00:10:50,332 --> 00:10:52,464
right now, Migs,
and I got to warn you,

183
00:10:52,638 --> 00:10:56,381
it is gonna be a reach.
So, you just bear with me, okay?

184
00:10:56,466 --> 00:10:58,207
Okay.

185
00:11:03,167 --> 00:11:07,610
So every morning, I take 20
milligrams of an antidepressant.

186
00:11:08,128 --> 00:11:10,917
Uh, I'm not sure who else
knows that besides Kate,

187
00:11:11,002 --> 00:11:13,482
but it's-it's not a big deal.

188
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:18,710
So, about a month after
I started taking, uh, the meds,

189
00:11:18,795 --> 00:11:21,798
I called my doctor
to renew my prescription.

190
00:11:22,011 --> 00:11:23,582
And he said,
"Oh, no, don't worry about it.

191
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,537
You have automatic refills."

192
00:11:27,683 --> 00:11:30,676
That hit me... really hard.

193
00:11:31,464 --> 00:11:34,073
You know, it just made it feel
so indefinite,

194
00:11:34,158 --> 00:11:36,247
so... so permanent.

195
00:11:37,144 --> 00:11:39,731
I said,
"Is there ever gonna be a time

196
00:11:39,816 --> 00:11:41,907
"when I am noton these meds?

197
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:44,481
I mean, is-is this ever
gonna end?"

198
00:11:45,011 --> 00:11:46,736
And... and then he...

199
00:11:46,821 --> 00:11:49,215
He says, "One day at time."

200
00:11:50,191 --> 00:11:52,238
- Hmm.
- One day at a time.

201
00:11:52,323 --> 00:11:56,464
An excellent TV show, and a
terrible answer to my question.

202
00:11:57,471 --> 00:12:00,262
Now, I don't know how it feels

203
00:12:00,347 --> 00:12:02,578
to stare down Alzheimer's.

204
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,974
But I do know how it feels

205
00:12:08,149 --> 00:12:10,325
to look at your life

206
00:12:10,499 --> 00:12:12,805
and to see all the things
that you want from it,

207
00:12:12,979 --> 00:12:16,853
and to have them all seem
so unattainable.

208
00:12:18,898 --> 00:12:20,857
Rebecca had a bad day.

209
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:22,989
She's gonna have more.

210
00:12:23,164 --> 00:12:25,688
You know.

211
00:12:25,862 --> 00:12:29,909
My long-winded advice is for you

212
00:12:30,084 --> 00:12:33,043
to remind her that to you,

213
00:12:33,217 --> 00:12:36,090
her happy future is very real.

214
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,702
One day at a time.

215
00:12:43,894 --> 00:12:45,011
It's a great show.

216
00:12:45,186 --> 00:12:47,057
The reboot is better.

217
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:48,650
I know.

218
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:50,977
I'm the one who started
the hashtag to get it revived

219
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:52,788
- after it got canceled.
- Is that right?

220
00:12:52,873 --> 00:12:54,406
You don't cancel Rita Moreno.

221
00:12:54,491 --> 00:12:55,631
Amen.

222
00:12:55,805 --> 00:12:57,200
Yeah.

223
00:12:57,285 --> 00:12:58,637
Oh, this is Rebecca's doctor
from L.A.

224
00:12:58,721 --> 00:13:00,764
- Yeah, go ahead.
- I got to take this.

225
00:13:00,873 --> 00:13:03,188
Hello. Hi, uh, Dr. Whitaker.

226
00:13:03,273 --> 00:13:05,110
Is that her doctor?
I need to speak with her.

227
00:13:05,195 --> 00:13:07,274
Yeah, yeah. This, uh...
It was this afternoon.

228
00:13:07,359 --> 00:13:09,119
- Give me the...
- It was a very severe episode.

229
00:13:09,203 --> 00:13:10,423
Miguel, I'd like to talk to her.

230
00:13:10,507 --> 00:13:12,033
Randall, just hold on
one second, please. Uh...

231
00:13:12,117 --> 00:13:13,520
Ask her if anything could have

232
00:13:13,605 --> 00:13:15,596
- negatively interacted with her meds.
- Just...

233
00:13:15,681 --> 00:13:17,471
Ask her
about the allergy medicine,

234
00:13:17,556 --> 00:13:19,993
the one she took
for poison ivy. Here.

235
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:24,276
Are you sure she took this?

236
00:13:24,361 --> 00:13:25,713
Yeah, she told me.

237
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:28,395
Hey, Dr. Whitaker, uh, yeah.

238
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,700
It looks like Rebecca took
an antihistamine with...

239
00:13:32,392 --> 00:13:34,541
Yes, diphenhydramine.

240
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,064
I do remember it from the list.

241
00:13:39,103 --> 00:13:40,261
Okay. Right.

242
00:13:40,346 --> 00:13:42,417
So it could have been
a reaction to the...

243
00:13:43,461 --> 00:13:45,855
Thank God. Okay.

244
00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:48,553
Yes, she's resting right now.

245
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:50,773
Yes.

246
00:13:50,947 --> 00:13:52,775
Absolutely. Yes, I will.

247
00:14:28,027 --> 00:14:29,507
Please forgive me.

248
00:14:29,681 --> 00:14:32,684
I'm so sorry.

249
00:14:32,858 --> 00:14:38,124
She was in... so much pain.

250
00:14:38,299 --> 00:14:40,301
Shh.

251
00:14:40,475 --> 00:14:42,694
It's okay. Shh.

252
00:14:42,868 --> 00:14:45,828
It's okay.
You've been crying all night.

253
00:14:46,002 --> 00:14:48,047
Aren't you tired? Huh?

254
00:14:50,093 --> 00:14:52,661
Still bad?

255
00:14:53,966 --> 00:14:55,533
We should go to the clinic,

256
00:14:55,707 --> 00:14:57,579
- try to get you looked at.
- No.

257
00:14:57,753 --> 00:15:00,712
If I tell that doctor
I'm on methadone to get clean,

258
00:15:00,886 --> 00:15:02,758
he'll look at me like I'm dirt.
Less than.

259
00:15:02,932 --> 00:15:04,542
- Laurel, please.
- No!

260
00:15:12,071 --> 00:15:16,206
I need you to get me
some stuff for the pain.

261
00:15:19,731 --> 00:15:23,213
Please. I've been good.

262
00:15:23,387 --> 00:15:25,041
I have.

263
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,391
It just... It hurts so bad.

264
00:15:27,565 --> 00:15:31,134
I just need a little help.
Just need a little help.

265
00:15:31,308 --> 00:15:32,701
Okay? Just one more time.

266
00:15:35,356 --> 00:15:38,881
So I can be there for the baby.

267
00:15:53,939 --> 00:15:56,551
I-I can't do it by myself.

268
00:16:00,424 --> 00:16:03,079
I can't take care of him.

269
00:16:06,212 --> 00:16:08,476
I'm so sorry.

270
00:16:11,827 --> 00:16:13,916
Please be with him.

271
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,746
Please take care of him.

272
00:16:27,016 --> 00:16:28,583
Excuse me.

273
00:16:53,956 --> 00:16:55,479
He used to pray so hard

274
00:16:55,653 --> 00:16:57,307
you could see the veins
in his neck.

275
00:17:00,832 --> 00:17:01,877
Yeah, I remember that.

276
00:17:02,051 --> 00:17:04,619
The veins in his neck.

277
00:17:07,143 --> 00:17:09,406
Never knew what he was
asking for.

278
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:15,020
I used to tell myself
he was asking to be better.

279
00:17:15,194 --> 00:17:17,849
Better to us.

280
00:17:18,107 --> 00:17:19,756
A better man.

281
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:23,724
And then I would pray.

282
00:17:24,682 --> 00:17:28,164
Pray that it would work.
That he would change.

283
00:17:34,834 --> 00:17:36,717
Then, when he never did...

284
00:17:38,696 --> 00:17:41,003
that's when I gave up
on all of this.

285
00:17:47,879 --> 00:17:50,708
Every hand you've dealt me
has been crap.

286
00:17:50,882 --> 00:17:53,529
But still, I kept trying.

287
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,701
All these years...

288
00:17:58,514 --> 00:18:02,633
trying to always do
what's right.

289
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:06,071
Trying to be the better man;
the man that he never was.

290
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:15,211
Has that made you laugh...
seeing me try?

291
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:20,564
Knowing that,
somewhere deep down...

292
00:18:20,865 --> 00:18:24,220
in spite of everything,
that I probably still believed.

293
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:35,948
The only good thing that has
ever happened to me is her,

294
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:37,730
and if you...

295
00:19:00,037 --> 00:19:03,259
Please do not take her
away from me.

296
00:19:06,175 --> 00:19:07,481
I am begging you.

297
00:19:07,655 --> 00:19:10,919
I'm on my knees
begging for her.

298
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:16,185
Begging for my children.

299
00:19:19,362 --> 00:19:21,670
Take me if you want,
just don't...

300
00:19:37,616 --> 00:19:39,185
Just don't.

301
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,498
Don't you dare.

302
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:54,599
I had no idea that
medications could interact that way.

303
00:19:55,099 --> 00:19:57,229
- And they're sure it's temporary?
- That's what the doctor said.

304
00:19:57,313 --> 00:19:59,315
Said a reaction like that
can cause an episode

305
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:01,342
and then it can just wear off.

306
00:20:01,795 --> 00:20:03,342
It was a hell of a catch,
Randall.

307
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:04,842
Back at you.

308
00:20:06,842 --> 00:20:08,296
We're lucky you came, Randall.

309
00:20:08,381 --> 00:20:10,490
- Honestly.
- Yeah.

310
00:20:11,615 --> 00:20:13,439
I'm just happy she's okay.

311
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:19,358
So, um... I'm gonna take off.

312
00:20:19,443 --> 00:20:20,732
Wait, what? Now?

313
00:20:20,817 --> 00:20:23,080
- But cake.
- I, uh...

314
00:20:23,506 --> 00:20:25,769
I promised Beth and the girls
that I'd get home tonight.

315
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:28,576
They got a whole thing planned,
so...

316
00:20:30,451 --> 00:20:32,319
- Miguel.
- Drive safe.

317
00:20:32,404 --> 00:20:33,623
Tobias.

318
00:20:34,268 --> 00:20:36,227
Sis.

319
00:20:36,613 --> 00:20:38,136
Kev.

320
00:20:38,623 --> 00:20:40,073
Bye again.

321
00:20:47,842 --> 00:20:49,732
Hey, Randall.

322
00:20:50,789 --> 00:20:53,514
So, I was, uh... I was hoping

323
00:20:53,717 --> 00:20:56,024
that you and Kev would talk,
you know?

324
00:20:56,592 --> 00:20:58,123
- Clear the air.
- Kate...

325
00:21:00,248 --> 00:21:01,889
I'm not taking any sides.

326
00:21:01,974 --> 00:21:03,201
I know I live in L.A. with him,

327
00:21:03,285 --> 00:21:05,766
but I am totally Switzerland
on this one.

328
00:21:07,334 --> 00:21:08,950
Okay.

329
00:21:09,124 --> 00:21:10,568
Randall.

330
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,869
Are we good?

331
00:21:13,781 --> 00:21:16,307
I mean, I've been texting
and reaching out,

332
00:21:16,392 --> 00:21:18,506
and I haven't heard
anything back, really, and...

333
00:21:18,591 --> 00:21:20,462
I'm just so worried about...

334
00:21:21,185 --> 00:21:23,268
about you and Beth
and the girls.

335
00:21:23,521 --> 00:21:26,315
You know, with everything that's
going on in the news.

336
00:21:26,489 --> 00:21:29,257
I'm so overwhelmed by it,
I can't even imagine

337
00:21:29,342 --> 00:21:32,529
what you guys are all
going through, so..

338
00:21:33,113 --> 00:21:34,636
I'm so sorry.

339
00:21:39,415 --> 00:21:40,895
Sorry about what?

340
00:21:42,654 --> 00:21:46,740
Specifically,
what are you apologizing for?

341
00:21:48,568 --> 00:21:52,655
I'm just... I'm... sorry about
what's going on in the country

342
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,172
- and the protests and...
- Okay.

343
00:21:55,257 --> 00:21:57,651
But you've never
apologized before.

344
00:21:57,825 --> 00:21:59,829
And this isn't the first
Black person

345
00:21:59,914 --> 00:22:01,916
to be killed on camera.

346
00:22:03,831 --> 00:22:07,443
No, it's... it's not.

347
00:22:11,795 --> 00:22:13,104
I don't know,
this feels different.

348
00:22:13,188 --> 00:22:15,799
Not for me, Kate.

349
00:22:15,973 --> 00:22:18,846
It-It's never been different
for me.

350
00:22:20,935 --> 00:22:22,632
We grew up in the same house.

351
00:22:22,806 --> 00:22:24,768
Things like this have been
happening to Black people

352
00:22:24,852 --> 00:22:27,768
for years, and we've never
talked about it.

353
00:22:28,459 --> 00:22:29,595
Not once.

354
00:22:30,113 --> 00:22:32,607
Not once in 40 years.

355
00:22:37,778 --> 00:22:39,954
I don't know what to say.
I don't want to say...

356
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:42,287
- I don't want to say the wrong thing.
- Okay.

357
00:22:42,404 --> 00:22:45,801
So, growing up,
I, uh, I just had to keep

358
00:22:45,886 --> 00:22:48,693
so many things to myself
because...

359
00:22:49,964 --> 00:22:52,670
I didn't want to make
you guys feel bad.

360
00:22:52,755 --> 00:22:55,014
I didn't want you to have
to worry about

361
00:22:55,099 --> 00:22:57,188
saying the wrong thing.

362
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:00,035
Oh, God...

363
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:05,585
Well, you're right. I mean,
we never talked about it

364
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:08,319
as kids, and I think Mom and Dad
did the best they could,

365
00:23:08,404 --> 00:23:10,373
I guess, but...

366
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:12,804
but I didn't get involved,
I-I didn't even...

367
00:23:12,889 --> 00:23:14,849
See, I hate this, Kate.

368
00:23:16,207 --> 00:23:18,383
I hate seeing you upset.

369
00:23:19,685 --> 00:23:21,569
And normally I would hug you,

370
00:23:21,654 --> 00:23:24,952
and I would tell you that
you did all the right things.

371
00:23:25,037 --> 00:23:27,438
I would try to make it all
okay for you.

372
00:23:27,523 --> 00:23:29,045
But if I did that, Kate...

373
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:33,131
If I made things better for you,
then where does that leave me?

374
00:23:35,838 --> 00:23:37,840
I'm sorry, but I can't do that.

375
00:23:39,423 --> 00:23:42,453
That has been my pattern
all my life.

376
00:23:42,538 --> 00:23:45,541
And honestly, Kate,
it is exhausting.

377
00:23:48,975 --> 00:23:50,887
I'm exhausted.

378
00:23:52,548 --> 00:23:55,749
And all I want to do right now
is go home and be with my wife

379
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:57,256
and my girls.

380
00:24:01,361 --> 00:24:02,795
Okay.

381
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:05,208
Okay, um...

382
00:24:07,868 --> 00:24:09,469
I love you.

383
00:24:09,626 --> 00:24:11,541
I love you, too.

384
00:24:14,222 --> 00:24:15,876
Happy birthday, Sis.

385
00:24:16,472 --> 00:24:18,226
Happy birthday.

386
00:24:57,265 --> 00:24:59,397
Yeah?

387
00:24:59,571 --> 00:25:01,922
It's Jack.

388
00:25:06,752 --> 00:25:08,667
Been a while.

389
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:12,802
Yeah.

390
00:25:15,326 --> 00:25:16,327
You okay?

391
00:25:16,501 --> 00:25:18,503
Yeah. I...

392
00:25:21,637 --> 00:25:23,378
No, I...

393
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:25,859
I don't know.

394
00:25:28,644 --> 00:25:31,168
Can I ask you something?

395
00:25:35,477 --> 00:25:38,523
What were you praying for?
I mean, you know,

396
00:25:38,697 --> 00:25:40,656
back when we used
to go to church.

397
00:25:43,964 --> 00:25:45,530
You need money again
or something?

398
00:25:45,704 --> 00:25:47,968
Wh-What's going on?

399
00:25:48,142 --> 00:25:49,491
No, I'm good.

400
00:25:51,885 --> 00:25:54,757
I don't know why I called.
I was just... having a day.

401
00:25:54,931 --> 00:25:57,151
Uh... I'll let you go.

402
00:25:57,325 --> 00:25:59,022
- I hope you're okay.
- Jack.

403
00:26:01,111 --> 00:26:02,330
Yeah?

404
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:08,727
Uh, I prayed my kids would
turn out better than I did.

405
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:16,518
I'm trying, Pop.

406
00:26:18,172 --> 00:26:19,434
I'm really trying.

407
00:26:19,608 --> 00:26:21,697
Yeah, I-I know.

408
00:26:24,221 --> 00:26:27,181
- I gotta go.
- Hey, Jackie?

409
00:26:29,183 --> 00:26:30,532
Yeah?

410
00:26:32,099 --> 00:26:34,275
Happy birthday, kid.

Hey, Randall.

431
00:27:37,294 --> 00:27:39,122
Hey, listen,
I just wanted to, uh...

432
00:27:39,296 --> 00:27:41,767
Just wanted to say thanks
for, uh...

433
00:27:41,986 --> 00:27:43,517
thanks for coming out, you know,

434
00:27:43,602 --> 00:27:45,011
I really appreciate it.
If you hadn't, we, uh...

435
00:27:45,095 --> 00:27:47,140
No. Yeah, of course.

436
00:27:51,395 --> 00:27:52,875
Yeah.

437
00:27:53,049 --> 00:27:55,573
- I should go to beat the traffic.
- Yeah.

438
00:27:56,744 --> 00:27:57,967
Hey, Randall, uh...

439
00:27:59,564 --> 00:28:01,492
I'm having a-a girl.

440
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:05,228
A girl and a boy.
We just found out.

441
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,557
Congratulations, Kev.
That's great news.

442
00:28:12,642 --> 00:28:14,033
Thanks.

443
00:28:14,636 --> 00:28:17,291
Yeah, you're the first person
I've told.

444
00:28:20,463 --> 00:28:22,440
And I feel like, I don't know,
I feel like the boy,

445
00:28:22,524 --> 00:28:24,558
you know, I was a boy once,
I can handle a boy, right?

446
00:28:24,642 --> 00:28:26,314
But the girl, I...

447
00:28:27,475 --> 00:28:29,931
Ooh! So...

448
00:28:32,096 --> 00:28:34,664
Anyway, you got any
advice for me?

449
00:28:38,181 --> 00:28:40,575
You'll let her get away
with anything.

450
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:45,667
But her mom will be there
to fix your mistakes.

451
00:28:45,841 --> 00:28:48,583
Mom will probably be better
at everything, honestly.

452
00:28:48,757 --> 00:28:51,847
Yeah.

453
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:54,893
Yeah, she probably will be.

454
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,900
You know, in the strangest
of ways...

455
00:29:02,075 --> 00:29:04,425
I feel like I might have...

456
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:08,168
really found someone
really special, you know?

457
00:29:17,829 --> 00:29:19,440
I gotta go.

458
00:29:21,703 --> 00:29:24,097
Happy birthday.

459
00:29:25,707 --> 00:29:27,361
Happy birthday, Randall.

460
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,220
You gonna keep staring at me,

461
00:30:00,394 --> 00:30:02,091
or you gonna tell me
your name?

462
00:30:02,265 --> 00:30:03,875
I don't know.

463
00:30:04,049 --> 00:30:06,748
You gonna tell me your name?

464
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,926
- I'm Laurel.
- William.

465
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,928
But around here they call me...

466
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:14,930
Shakespeare!

467
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:17,062
Shakespeare, it's your stop.
You're home, kid.

468
00:30:17,237 --> 00:30:18,890
You getting off or what?

469
00:30:19,064 --> 00:30:23,634
No, I'm not getting off.
So just... keep going.

470
00:30:52,402 --> 00:30:54,012
Hi, Randall.

471
00:30:54,187 --> 00:30:57,494
Hi, Dr. Leigh.
Uh, sorry to bother you.

472
00:30:57,668 --> 00:31:00,149
I hope it's an okay time to...

473
00:31:01,672 --> 00:31:04,153
No, of course.
I-I saw your name,

474
00:31:04,327 --> 00:31:06,808
and I wanted to make sure
everything was all right.

475
00:31:08,375 --> 00:31:11,900
Yeah, no,
everything's all right.

476
00:31:12,074 --> 00:31:14,032
But...

477
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:18,123
When we first met, Dr. Leigh,

478
00:31:18,298 --> 00:31:20,996
you made a point of pointing out

479
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:24,086
just how few Black men
seek you out for therapy.

480
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:28,090
It's a "very small number,"
were your words.

481
00:31:28,264 --> 00:31:30,353
I remember.

482
00:31:30,527 --> 00:31:33,008
I made a conscious choice
to start seeing

483
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:35,184
a white female therapist.

484
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:38,143
I know that.

485
00:31:38,318 --> 00:31:39,754
It's complicated for me,

486
00:31:39,928 --> 00:31:41,495
and I can't claim
to understand it,

487
00:31:41,669 --> 00:31:43,584
but I... but I do know it.

488
00:31:43,758 --> 00:31:46,195
If that makes sense.

489
00:31:50,373 --> 00:31:54,290
There are things, Dr. Leigh,
that I don't feel comfortable

490
00:31:54,464 --> 00:31:56,510
talking to you about.

491
00:31:57,902 --> 00:32:02,864
There's stuff I-I put away
when I enter your office, and...

492
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:06,212
that doesn't help me get better.

493
00:32:06,305 --> 00:32:08,861
And there's nothing you can do
to make me more comfortable.

494
00:32:08,946 --> 00:32:11,699
I just...

495
00:32:11,873 --> 00:32:14,092
I need something different.

496
00:32:18,575 --> 00:32:23,363
I'm gonna make a change
and find a Black therapist.

497
00:32:23,537 --> 00:32:27,367
And I just wanted
to tell you that directly.

498
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:35,679
Randall, obviously your mental
health is what's important her,

499
00:32:35,853 --> 00:32:38,726
and if that's something that
you're feeling strongly about..

500
00:32:43,034 --> 00:32:44,688
Hey.

501
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:50,085
I knew that the meal
was important to you, so...

502
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:51,913
I'm doing the best
that I can.

503
00:32:52,087 --> 00:32:55,917
So be gentle in your critique.

504
00:33:03,707 --> 00:33:07,798
Is that what
it's gonna feel like...

505
00:33:07,972 --> 00:33:09,713
when I eventually...

506
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:11,585
We don't have to worry
about that.

507
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:14,152
Not-not today.

508
00:33:19,636 --> 00:33:23,118
- You know what's so strange?
- Hmm?

509
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:26,600
I'm not worried about
forgetting about the big stuff.

510
00:33:30,343 --> 00:33:32,475
It's the little things.

511
00:33:32,649 --> 00:33:35,435
It's the...

512
00:33:35,609 --> 00:33:38,612
It's the regular...

513
00:33:38,786 --> 00:33:41,615
Saturday when the kids
were little.

514
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:49,144
A day when nothing big
really happens. J...

515
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:51,668
We were just there,
a normal family,

516
00:33:51,842 --> 00:33:53,627
like any other normal family.

517
00:33:53,801 --> 00:33:57,935
Laughing and talking and...

518
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:03,027
...playing pin the tail
on the donkey.

519
00:34:09,164 --> 00:34:12,341
That's the stuff I'm not ready
to let go of yet.

520
00:34:14,952 --> 00:34:16,998
I want to show you something.

521
00:34:18,782 --> 00:34:19,653
Come on.

522
00:34:19,827 --> 00:34:21,829
- Come on.
- What...

523
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,362
- I chopped down the dead tree.
- Hmm.

524
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:36,432
And I know that you said
you wanted to plant a sapling...

525
00:34:36,583 --> 00:34:39,717
- Mm-hmm.
- ...so that we could get fruit sooner, but,

526
00:34:39,802 --> 00:34:43,032
I don't know, it just seemed,
um... too easy.

527
00:34:43,198 --> 00:34:46,984
So, instead, I got these.

528
00:34:47,158 --> 00:34:49,073
Oh...

529
00:34:50,248 --> 00:34:53,774
Now, these should bear fruit

530
00:34:53,948 --> 00:34:57,386
in about... six to ten years.

531
00:34:59,562 --> 00:35:01,346
Six to ten years?
I don't...

532
00:35:01,521 --> 00:35:03,087
I am not in a rush.

533
00:35:03,261 --> 00:35:05,742
One day at a time.

534
00:35:05,916 --> 00:35:08,702
And then another...

535
00:35:08,876 --> 00:35:11,661
And then another.

536
00:35:11,835 --> 00:35:13,707
I love you.

537
00:35:13,881 --> 00:35:16,579
- I love you.
- Thank you.

538
00:35:20,322 --> 00:35:22,280
Hey.

539
00:35:23,673 --> 00:35:25,414
Guess what.

540
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:30,463
What's going on?

541
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:36,120
I can't stop thinking about
what Randall said.

542
00:35:38,775 --> 00:35:40,734
I've been so oblivious.

543
00:35:44,172 --> 00:35:46,740
- What can I do?
- Noth-Nothing.

544
00:35:46,914 --> 00:35:49,307
That's sweet,
but I'm gonna have to

545
00:35:49,482 --> 00:35:51,440
sit with these feelings
a while.

546
00:35:54,051 --> 00:35:58,447
Well, we'll just have to get it
all right raising our children.

547
00:35:58,621 --> 00:36:00,449
Yeah. Yes.

548
00:36:00,623 --> 00:36:03,452
Raising our children,

549
00:36:03,626 --> 00:36:06,977
- which is the plural of "child."
- Mm-hmm.

550
00:36:07,151 --> 00:36:09,240
Children.

551
00:36:09,414 --> 00:36:11,286
Are you doing something
confusing?

552
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,638
'Cause I don't...
I don't get it.

553
00:36:12,722 --> 00:36:14,289
Apparently. Listen.

554
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:17,161
I just got six messages
from the adoption agency.

555
00:36:17,335 --> 00:36:20,817
Kate, we have a match.

556
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:23,132
Wh...

557
00:36:23,298 --> 00:36:25,256
What?

558
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:26,954
They found us a match.

559
00:36:27,128 --> 00:36:29,652
- For real?
- Yes.

560
00:36:29,826 --> 00:36:33,438
- We're getting a baby?
- We gettin' a ba...

I'm healthier
than I've been in years.

581
00:38:00,656 --> 00:38:03,790
But what I'm dealing
with at work,

582
00:38:03,964 --> 00:38:06,183
and what we're dealing with
as a people,

583
00:38:06,357 --> 00:38:08,751
day after day...

584
00:38:11,449 --> 00:38:15,845
- It's just so tragic, Beth.
- Mm-hmm.

585
00:38:16,019 --> 00:38:18,892
So much loss.

586
00:38:22,547 --> 00:38:25,246
It's just so sad.

587
00:38:28,336 --> 00:38:32,122
I-I'm not falling apart.
I'm not having a breakdown.

588
00:38:34,647 --> 00:38:38,259
I'm just really,
really sad, baby.

589
00:38:44,091 --> 00:38:47,703
When my dad was dying, I...

590
00:38:47,877 --> 00:38:50,314
remember he said
that it's the tragedies

591
00:38:50,488 --> 00:38:52,752
that define our lives.

592
00:38:54,797 --> 00:38:56,190
"They are the fence posts
on which

593
00:38:56,364 --> 00:38:59,497
the rest of our lives
hang, baby girl."

594
00:39:01,499 --> 00:39:03,937
I always think about that.

595
00:39:04,111 --> 00:39:06,156
Like...

596
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:10,117
our lives just hanging there,

597
00:39:10,291 --> 00:39:13,468
between these really sad
fence posts.

598
00:39:19,561 --> 00:39:21,781
Baby.

599
00:39:21,955 --> 00:39:23,521

605
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:42,976
And look at what you've hung on
your fence posts.

606
00:39:44,586 --> 00:39:46,414
Look right in front of you.

607
00:39:46,588 --> 00:39:49,852
Right here in this room, and...

608
00:39:50,026 --> 00:39:52,072
I mean, look what you did
with all of that.

609
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:59,470
Do you see it?

610
00:39:59,644 --> 00:40:01,472
I see it.

611
00:40:02,517 --> 00:40:07,043
You are a beautiful,
resilient man.

612
00:40:07,217 --> 00:40:11,526
The world is a brilliant,
resilient place.

613
00:40:13,484 --> 00:40:16,009
We fight on.

614
00:40:17,924 --> 00:40:20,013

life has to offer.

616
00:40:22,276 --> 00:40:23,802
Okay, that's your thing,
you know what I mean?

617
00:40:23,886 --> 00:40:24,977
- I was doing my thing.
- Mm-hmm.

618
00:40:25,061 --> 00:40:26,149
Can we stay with my thing?

619
00:40:26,323 --> 00:40:28,717
- Yeah.
- Okay.

620
00:40:28,891 --> 00:40:31,415
This pain is not forever.

621
00:40:33,417 --> 00:40:35,811
This moment in time
is not forever.

622
00:40:36,899 --> 00:40:41,556
Nothing is forever, except us.

623
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:48,563

- We fight on.

You're not, like,
secretly expecting

631
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:11,586
- some big surprise party or anything?
- Mm-mm, no.

632
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,068
All I need
is in this room right now.

633
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:20,377
I think we could all use
a year with no surprises.

634
00:41:20,551 --> 00:41:22,771
Mm. Yes.

635
00:41:22,945 --> 00:41:24,599
- Yeah.
- Mm.

636
00:41:26,296 --> 00:41:27,736
Let's
mark the time and call it in.

637
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,650
We need to call the cops
and Child Services, too.

638
00:41:29,734 --> 00:41:31,127
This is a mess.

639
00:41:31,301 --> 00:41:33,129
Sir, we're gonna need you
to wait here.

640
00:41:36,089 --> 00:41:37,786
Where'd he go?

641
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,267
I'll let the cops figure out
what to do about that.

642
00:41:49,929 --> 00:41:50,930
Wait.

643
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:54,107
Wait. I think I've got a pulse.
