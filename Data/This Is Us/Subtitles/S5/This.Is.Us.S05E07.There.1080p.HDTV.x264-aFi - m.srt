00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:08,106
<i>Allegheny College has
a weekend QB camp</i>

3
00:00:08,191 --> 00:00:10,245
<i>for seventh and eighth graders
right up in Meadville.</i>

4
00:00:10,329 --> 00:00:11,574
<i>Kev would be a great fit.</i>

5
00:00:11,659 --> 00:00:13,433
I don't care what Coach says.

6
00:00:13,556 --> 00:00:15,597
- I'm gonna quit.
- You're the quarterback.

7
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,379
You made a commitment
to that team.

8
00:00:17,464 --> 00:00:19,035
You don't just quit

9
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,832
the second something
starts to feel tough.

10
00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:22,950
He's a child playing a game.

11
00:00:23,099 --> 00:00:24,595
It's supposed to be fun.

12
00:00:24,734 --> 00:00:27,128
You can be really easy
on him,

13
00:00:27,213 --> 00:00:28,884
and it's made him soft.

14
00:00:29,111 --> 00:00:30,495
And why'd they call me?

15
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:32,362
To be honest, I have no idea.

16
00:00:32,447 --> 00:00:33,776
- "To be honest"?
- Can I get that last line?

17
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:34,837
You know, I just,
if you want to

18
00:00:34,922 --> 00:00:36,488
- give me a specific detail...
- NMo, no no. Stay in the scene.

19
00:00:36,572 --> 00:00:38,316
I'm trying to stay in the scene,
but you keep...

20
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,359
- interrupting me.
- Believe me, Kevin,

21
00:00:40,533 --> 00:00:42,963
- I wish I didn't have to interrupt.
- They're moving

22
00:00:43,048 --> 00:00:44,658
the filming of the movie
to Vancouver.

23
00:00:44,758 --> 00:00:48,205
Okay, four weeks away
puts you back here...

24
00:00:49,392 --> 00:00:51,633
a solid five weeks
before the babies are due.

25
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:54,900
You have worked so hard
on this movie.

26
00:00:55,165 --> 00:00:56,759
This can't all be for nothing.

27
00:00:57,095 --> 00:00:59,104
I think you should use
this time away

28
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:01,142
to figure out
how these babies and I

29
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,050
are actually gonna fit
in your life.

00:02:00,032 --> 00:02:01,332
Come on, let's go.

35
00:02:01,417 --> 00:02:03,728
You don't want to be late
for your championship game.

36
00:02:04,252 --> 00:02:06,887
Whole team's counting on
that arm of yours.

37
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,345
Please, please, please.

38
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:29,673

00:02:56,446 --> 00:02:57,861
Hey, kiddo.

42
00:02:58,369 --> 00:02:59,814
You all set for this weekend?

43
00:02:59,993 --> 00:03:02,565
Yeah. Just finished packing.

44
00:03:02,658 --> 00:03:05,384
Okay. I'm gonna change,
and then we'll hit the road.

45
00:03:05,603 --> 00:03:08,370
We should get to the hotel
about 7:00.

46
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:09,508
Make sure you get...

47
00:03:09,682 --> 00:03:12,249
plenty of rest
before quarterback camp.

48
00:03:12,922 --> 00:03:14,689
Cool. I'm ready whenever.

49
00:03:15,092 --> 00:03:17,268
All right.
Hey, you know, they're...

50
00:03:17,353 --> 00:03:19,409
they're saying
that there's gonna be two QBs

51
00:03:19,494 --> 00:03:21,290
from Penn State there.

52
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:22,908
You do good this weekend,

53
00:03:22,993 --> 00:03:25,828
word is gonna spread quick that
you're the next Terry Bradshaw.

54
00:03:26,337 --> 00:03:27,469
Mm-hmm.

55
00:03:27,712 --> 00:03:28,744
Can't wait.

56
00:03:29,446 --> 00:03:30,790
Yeah.

57
00:03:41,556 --> 00:03:43,535
Objection!
All due respect, Your Honor,

58
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,884
this is a man here who knowingly
misrepresented the evidence.

59
00:03:47,531 --> 00:03:48,720
That's good.

60
00:03:48,805 --> 00:03:52,161
All due respect, Your Honor,
we're dealing with a man...

61
00:03:52,246 --> 00:03:53,290
Your Honor... No.

62
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,908
- Judge...
- Judge...

63
00:03:55,075 --> 00:03:56,861
Judge, Your Honor,
all due respect,

64
00:03:56,946 --> 00:03:58,925
this is a man who knowingly
misrepresented the evidence.

65
00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:00,343
I object. And furthermore...

66
00:04:00,428 --> 00:04:01,560
...furthermore...

67
00:04:01,734 --> 00:04:03,387
Yeah.

68
00:04:03,562 --> 00:04:05,085
Uh...

69
00:04:06,042 --> 00:04:07,042
Oh, hey.

70
00:04:07,174 --> 00:04:08,654
Hey. Thank you

71
00:04:08,741 --> 00:04:09,746
for the edible arrangement.

72
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,269
It is... elaborate, Kev.

73
00:04:12,354 --> 00:04:14,747
- And kind of romantic.
- Was it?

74
00:04:14,858 --> 00:04:16,338
Oh, see?
I told them to take it easy

75
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:17,741
on the chocolate-covered
strawberries.

76
00:04:17,825 --> 00:04:20,961
I just, I wasn't sure what the
appropriate gift would for...

77
00:04:21,144 --> 00:04:23,277
<i>when the birth mother
of your twin sister's baby</i>

78
00:04:23,451 --> 00:04:24,626
<i>is being induced.</i>

79
00:04:24,807 --> 00:04:26,548
Uh, it's actually a Tesla.

80
00:04:26,715 --> 00:04:29,400
Well, okay, they were all out
of chocolate-covered Teslas.

81
00:04:29,485 --> 00:04:31,593
All right? So... so how are,
uh, how are you two doing?

82
00:04:31,677 --> 00:04:33,687
What's going on?
Are you guys excited?

83
00:04:33,772 --> 00:04:34,828
Yeah.

84
00:04:34,913 --> 00:04:36,527
Yeah. We're just waiting
for Jack's sitter to get here,

85
00:04:36,611 --> 00:04:38,787
and then, um, we're
gonna head down to San Pedro

86
00:04:38,895 --> 00:04:41,054
and meet Ellie
at the hospital, so...

87
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:42,820
How's Vancouver?
How's the movie?

88
00:04:42,905 --> 00:04:44,257
Movie is going great.
Actually, tonight is

89
00:04:44,341 --> 00:04:46,054
my big courtroom scene...
You know, the one

90
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:47,796
where I cross-examine De Niro?

91
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:49,374
That sounds terrifying.

92
00:04:49,477 --> 00:04:52,069
Yeah, yeah, it's my big "did
you order the Code Red" moment.

93
00:04:52,155 --> 00:04:54,287
Every time I think about it,
I pee a little.

94
00:04:54,438 --> 00:04:55,614
Ew, that's gross.

95
00:04:55,788 --> 00:04:57,889
Okay, so you are back
next week?

96
00:04:57,991 --> 00:05:00,015
Mm-hmm, yep.
Thank God, back next week,

97
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,343
and I swear I'm not leaving
the house for, like, a month.

98
00:05:02,499 --> 00:05:04,452
All I'm gonna do is stare
at Madison's belly

99
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:06,931
<i>and just wait for the twins
to make their big debut.</i>

100
00:05:07,016 --> 00:05:08,583
Oh...

101
00:05:08,757 --> 00:05:11,589
Oh, hey, um, Jack's, uh,
sitter is here, so I gotta go.

102
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:13,994
<i>Okay. Well, uh, listen,
keep me posted and, uh</i>

103
00:05:14,154 --> 00:05:17,053
tell the birth mother
I said "happy pushing."

104
00:05:17,176 --> 00:05:18,544
Uh, not gonna do that.

105
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:19,869
But, hey, will you tell De Niro

106
00:05:19,981 --> 00:05:21,897
that I loved him
in Meet the Fockers.

107
00:05:21,982 --> 00:05:23,080
Not gonna do that.

108
00:05:23,165 --> 00:05:24,732
Okay, fine. I love you.

109
00:05:24,855 --> 00:05:27,074
I love you, too. Bye.

110
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,257
Whew.

111
00:05:31,052 --> 00:05:32,475
- What's up, man?
- Hey.

112
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,780
De Niro's still
in hair and makeup,

113
00:05:33,864 --> 00:05:35,567
but I figured you'd want to be
on set when he got there.

114
00:05:35,651 --> 00:05:37,789
Yeah, good call. Not a man
you want to keep waiting, right?

115
00:05:37,873 --> 00:05:39,238
No.

116
00:05:39,754 --> 00:05:41,499
Hey, honey.
Listen, uh, I'm about ready

117
00:05:41,584 --> 00:05:43,719
to start shooting with De Niro.
Is there a way I can call you...

118
00:05:43,803 --> 00:05:46,490
Kevin, I think
I'm having contractions.

119
00:05:46,701 --> 00:05:49,142
What? No, no, no, we're supposed
to have another couple weeks.

120
00:05:49,276 --> 00:05:51,632
It might just be Braxton-Hicks,
but, um,

121
00:05:51,717 --> 00:05:53,733
I've had those before,
and they don't feel like this.

122
00:05:53,817 --> 00:05:56,014
Um, I called Dr. Alexander,

123
00:05:56,099 --> 00:05:57,763
and she said I should
come in right away.

124
00:05:57,848 --> 00:05:59,327
It's good
that she's being cautious.

125
00:05:59,412 --> 00:06:01,027
Maybe-maybe it's a false alarm.

126
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:04,969
Maybe, but, um,
I don't think so.

127
00:06:05,928 --> 00:06:09,420
Okay, um, I gotta go.
I'll...

128
00:06:09,505 --> 00:06:10,764
I'll call you when
I get to the hospital.

129
00:06:10,848 --> 00:06:13,256
Just... pick up if you can.

130
00:06:13,739 --> 00:06:15,181
Yeah, I...

131
00:06:22,488 --> 00:06:23,803
Hey.

132
00:06:24,324 --> 00:06:26,501
Hey, Kevin, uh,

133
00:06:26,863 --> 00:06:29,201
De Niro should be here
in, like, five,

134
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,522
and then we'll do
a rehearsal, all right?

135
00:06:30,606 --> 00:06:32,409
Sounds... sounds good.
Listen, I think my fiancÃ©e's

136
00:06:32,493 --> 00:06:33,709
in-in labor.

137
00:06:33,799 --> 00:06:36,670
Oh, wow.

138
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:38,800
That's awesome.
Congratulations.

139
00:06:39,022 --> 00:06:40,459
Thank you.

140
00:06:41,202 --> 00:06:42,769
Six weeks early.

141
00:06:43,248 --> 00:06:45,585
And I know with twins
it's normal to be early,

142
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:46,960
but that's, like, three weeks.

143
00:06:47,045 --> 00:06:49,537
This is... six weeks.

144
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:52,632
Well, look, I'm-I'm sure
it'll be fine.

145
00:06:52,717 --> 00:06:56,168
You know, my brother, uh,
he had his son super early,

146
00:06:56,254 --> 00:06:58,419
and the kid just graduated
valedictorian,

147
00:06:58,504 --> 00:07:00,201
so...

148
00:07:00,536 --> 00:07:01,793
Cool.

149
00:07:04,111 --> 00:07:06,809
She, you know, she's, uh...
She seemed pretty scared.

150
00:07:07,746 --> 00:07:10,231
And she's alone.

151
00:07:11,972 --> 00:07:13,879
I think I should go to her.

152
00:07:16,598 --> 00:07:19,644
Okay. Okay, look, uh,

153
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:22,371
I'll try and move
quickly here.

154
00:07:22,456 --> 00:07:24,520
We could probably get this
in six or seven hours,

155
00:07:24,605 --> 00:07:26,449
and then, uh,
I'll talk to Steve.

156
00:07:26,534 --> 00:07:28,576
Uh, and we can push
all the pick-up days

157
00:07:28,661 --> 00:07:30,075
so we can get you out of here
first thing tomorrow. Okay?

158
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:33,353
- How does that sound?
- I don't think that's gonna work.

159
00:07:35,643 --> 00:07:37,809
What are you saying, Kevin?

160
00:07:37,895 --> 00:07:40,934
- De Niro is walking. Here in two.
- Thank you.

161
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:48,988
I'm sorry.

162
00:07:49,824 --> 00:07:50,983
I'm sorry, Foster.

163
00:07:51,093 --> 00:07:53,801
Tell him I said I am very sorry,
but I gotta go.

164
00:07:54,053 --> 00:07:55,968
W...

165
00:08:06,738 --> 00:08:09,660
How you feeling?
Ready to pitch a no-hitter?

166
00:08:10,402 --> 00:08:12,252
Yeah, Dad. Feeling good.

167
00:08:12,496 --> 00:08:14,237
Come on, get in.

168
00:08:28,565 --> 00:08:30,793
Gonna be some adventure.

169
00:08:30,961 --> 00:08:32,504
Ready?

170
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,017
- Hey.
- Hey, how we doing?

171
00:08:41,101 --> 00:08:42,754
On my way to the hospital.

172
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:45,645
I really don't think
these are fake contractions.

173
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:50,459
Okay, listen. Uh, I'm coming.

174
00:08:50,544 --> 00:08:52,104
Okay? I'm coming,
I'm leaving right now.

175
00:08:52,239 --> 00:08:54,116
- You are?
- Yeah. Just hang in there, all right?

176
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,767
I promise, I will...

177
00:08:56,073 --> 00:08:59,163
I will get to you, all right?

178
00:09:16,582 --> 00:09:18,823
Always exciting seeing
a game end

179
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:20,863
in a walk-off home run.

180
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,574
Just not when your kid's
the pitcher.

181
00:09:24,947 --> 00:09:26,645
I only gave up one run.

182
00:09:26,957 --> 00:09:28,647
It's not my fault
the guys weren't hitting.

183
00:09:28,821 --> 00:09:32,129
Yeah, that sounds like
an excuse to me.

184
00:09:40,572 --> 00:09:43,199
Hey, Dad, maybe we should,
uh...

185
00:09:43,727 --> 00:09:45,380
wait around a bit

186
00:09:45,579 --> 00:09:48,582
- before going home.
- Why?

187
00:09:49,972 --> 00:09:51,848
I just, um...

188
00:09:52,652 --> 00:09:54,855
What... you-you think
I can't drive?

189
00:09:54,965 --> 00:09:58,147
No. I just...

190
00:10:01,906 --> 00:10:03,125
Fine.

191
00:10:04,627 --> 00:10:06,977
You drive, hotshot.

192
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:11,740
First time for everything.

193
00:10:15,838 --> 00:10:19,363
<i>âª Far away âª</i>

194
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:23,887
<i>âª All you got to do
right now is say... âª</i>

195
00:10:23,972 --> 00:10:26,670
Did I ever tell you
I played Little League

196
00:10:26,887 --> 00:10:28,561
when I was a kid?

197
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:31,756
Yeah.
I was a pretty good pitcher.

198
00:10:32,197 --> 00:10:34,685
Had all these dreams about
being the next Bob Friend.

199
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:36,257
Who?

200
00:10:36,342 --> 00:10:38,749
You don't know who Bob Fr...?

201
00:10:40,837 --> 00:10:43,153
I guess it was
a little ahead of your time.

202
00:10:44,016 --> 00:10:47,392
So, Bob Friend
was a four-time all-star.

203
00:10:47,774 --> 00:10:50,813
Helped the Pirates
win the 1960 World Series.

204
00:10:51,482 --> 00:10:54,284
1960?
How old are you?

205
00:10:54,369 --> 00:10:57,048
Ha, ha, ha.

206
00:11:06,672 --> 00:11:08,500
- Whoa.
- Hmm?

207
00:11:08,831 --> 00:11:10,830
Football camp
is really expensive.

208
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,651
Nah. Kev, don't...

209
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,185
don't worry about that.

210
00:11:15,861 --> 00:11:18,408
Now, when you get a football
scholarship to Penn State,

211
00:11:18,493 --> 00:11:21,104
this weekend is gonna be
the best investment I ever made.

212
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:29,091
I don't care

213
00:11:29,165 --> 00:11:31,454
where my seat is. I do not care
what airline it is.

214
00:11:31,539 --> 00:11:33,095
I just need to get
on the next flight to L.A.

215
00:11:33,158 --> 00:11:35,713
I'm on my way to Vancouver
Airport right now, and I will

216
00:11:35,798 --> 00:11:37,970
literally get on whatever flight
you can book for me.

217
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:42,202
Hmm. I'm not seeing
anything direct from Vancouver

218
00:11:42,287 --> 00:11:43,893
to Los Angeles
until tomorrow morning.

219
00:11:44,266 --> 00:11:47,001
I can't do tomorrow morning.
I... What about indirect?

220
00:11:47,431 --> 00:11:49,946
Well, how do you
feel about flying economy?

221
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:52,381
I know you're big on
legroom.-

222
00:11:53,321 --> 00:11:55,427
Well, at this point,
I'll cut my legs off.

223
00:11:55,512 --> 00:11:57,596
Just get me
on the next flight to L.A.

224
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:02,379
- Anything, honey?
- Yes.

225
00:12:02,463 --> 00:12:03,904
- Oh, your mom has one.
- What? Yes!

226
00:12:03,988 --> 00:12:05,417
Great! Thank God.
What time?

227
00:12:05,502 --> 00:12:07,026
Oh, wait. No, sorry. I...

228
00:12:07,289 --> 00:12:10,362
I-I put in the code
for Victorville, not Vancouver.

229
00:12:10,447 --> 00:12:12,279
There are a lot of flights
from Victorville, though.

230
00:12:12,363 --> 00:12:14,590
Yeah, but I said...
I'm not in Victorville, Mom.

231
00:12:14,675 --> 00:12:16,862
Why didn't the movie
give you an assistant

232
00:12:17,014 --> 00:12:18,581
to do these kind of things?

233
00:12:18,755 --> 00:12:20,191
You know,
it's-it's an indie film.

234
00:12:20,276 --> 00:12:21,836
It's a smaller budget,
and I-I told them

235
00:12:21,921 --> 00:12:24,532
I'd take one for the team and...
and go without,

236
00:12:24,624 --> 00:12:26,287
which I am deeply regretting
at the moment. -

237
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:28,286
Geez!

238
00:12:28,797 --> 00:12:31,202
S-Sorry,
some maniac just cut me off.

239
00:12:31,287 --> 00:12:32,723
Kev, be careful.

240
00:12:32,913 --> 00:12:35,206
Me? I'm... I am be...
I'm being careful.

241
00:12:35,301 --> 00:12:37,481
Wait, wait, wait. Hold
on, hold on. Good news, good news.

242
00:12:37,565 --> 00:12:38,827
Uh, it looks like there are

243
00:12:38,912 --> 00:12:40,452
a few domestic flights
left tonight.

244
00:12:40,537 --> 00:12:42,061
- Oh.
- Kevin,

245
00:12:42,146 --> 00:12:43,858
just keep driving
towards the border.

246
00:12:43,943 --> 00:12:45,617
We're gonna try to book you
something out of Seattle,

247
00:12:45,701 --> 00:12:47,503
- and we'll call you back.
Okay? -

248
00:12:47,587 --> 00:12:50,223
Okay, great.
Thank you very much. Thank you.

249
00:12:50,308 --> 00:12:51,486
I j... I...
Sorry, I got to take this.

250
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,050
My agent won't stop
hounding me.

251
00:12:53,475 --> 00:12:55,400
- Hello?
<i>- Please tell me</i>

252
00:12:55,485 --> 00:12:57,374
you didn't really walk out
on De Niro.

253
00:12:58,923 --> 00:13:01,764
Madison's in labor,
and she's six weeks early.

254
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:02,991
<i>Oh, God.</i>

255
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,983
Okay, how close is she
to giving birth?

256
00:13:05,068 --> 00:13:06,303
'Cause maybe we

257
00:13:06,388 --> 00:13:08,569
get you back to L.A.,
you meet the babies,

258
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:10,061
and we have you back
in Vancouver

259
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:12,468
- by tomorrow morning.
- You got...

260
00:13:12,553 --> 00:13:14,793
I-I'm not doing this, man. Look, I...

261
00:13:14,953 --> 00:13:16,476
I got to go.

262
00:13:18,488 --> 00:13:20,403
Hey. How's it going?

263
00:13:20,687 --> 00:13:21,993
Okay.

264
00:13:22,174 --> 00:13:25,811
I'm here.
I'm, uh, I'm waiting for a room.

265
00:13:26,046 --> 00:13:27,475
I'm not in active labor,

266
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,780
so nobody seems to be
in a rush to see me.

267
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:31,566
But what about
your private room?

268
00:13:31,653 --> 00:13:33,007
You're supposed to have
a private room.

269
00:13:33,091 --> 00:13:34,396
They're trying to find one.

270
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,295
I'm six weeks
before my due date.

271
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,670
- Nobody was expecting me.
- No, no, no.

272
00:13:38,755 --> 00:13:40,835
No, no, no. Th-They said
that the room would be ready

273
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,115
when-when you're in labor.

274
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,608
And you're in labor,
so the room should be ready,

275
00:13:43,692 --> 00:13:45,772
right? I'll handle this.

276
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,357
- Kevin, it's okay.
<i>- No. No, it's not okay.</i>

277
00:13:48,442 --> 00:13:49,592
You should have a private room.
I got a card

278
00:13:49,676 --> 00:13:50,894
right here from the hospital

279
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:52,446
with a direct line
I'm supposed to call

280
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:53,898
if something like this happens.
I'm gonna call right now,

281
00:13:53,982 --> 00:13:55,508
and I'm gonna go
full Terms of Endearment

282
00:13:55,592 --> 00:13:58,068
on their ass.

283
00:14:00,355 --> 00:14:01,965
Where are you?

284
00:14:04,217 --> 00:14:05,741
I'm, uh...

285
00:14:06,156 --> 00:14:07,520
I'm on my way to the airport.

286
00:14:07,605 --> 00:14:09,395
Miguel and my mom
are trying to book me a flight.

287
00:14:09,479 --> 00:14:12,003
So, hopefully, I'll be there
in the next couple hours.

288
00:14:12,203 --> 00:14:13,297
Okay.

289
00:14:14,077 --> 00:14:17,645
I'm coming. I promise.

290
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,475
Madison, I'll be there.

291
00:14:22,227 --> 00:14:23,688
Okay.

292
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,728
- Randall, hey.
- Hey, Kev.

293
00:14:40,815 --> 00:14:42,766
We're driving home
from New Orleans.

294
00:14:42,873 --> 00:14:44,235
A long story.

295
00:14:44,546 --> 00:14:46,417
I was wondering
if we could talk.

296
00:14:46,734 --> 00:14:47,938
Randall, I'm sorry.

297
00:14:48,023 --> 00:14:49,782
I can't right now, okay?
My whole life

298
00:14:49,867 --> 00:14:51,587
has... been turned upside down.

299
00:14:51,672 --> 00:14:53,696
Madison's in labor,
and I'm stuck

300
00:14:53,781 --> 00:14:55,297
here in Vancouver.

301
00:14:55,905 --> 00:14:57,319
I'm trying to get home
in time for the births,

302
00:14:57,403 --> 00:14:59,405
but she's already
at the hospital, and...

303
00:14:59,984 --> 00:15:01,662
She's all alone.

304
00:15:01,747 --> 00:15:02,792
I never...

305
00:15:03,643 --> 00:15:04,951
Never should have come here.

306
00:15:05,045 --> 00:15:05,811
Hey, Kev...

307
00:15:05,896 --> 00:15:08,037
Randall, I'm sorry.
I'll-I'll call you soon, okay?

308
00:15:08,122 --> 00:15:09,688
I'm sorry.

309
00:15:16,342 --> 00:15:17,342
Hello?

310
00:15:17,436 --> 00:15:20,053
Hey. Kevin, this is Foster.

311
00:15:20,138 --> 00:15:21,514
I know, um...

312
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,260
I know you're really emotional
right now, but I...

313
00:15:23,344 --> 00:15:24,873
I do need you to turn around

314
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,062
and come back to set
immediately.

315
00:15:26,146 --> 00:15:28,397
Now, shut up. Just shut...
You know what? Shut up.

316
00:15:28,591 --> 00:15:29,810
Just shut your mouth.

317
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:31,157
Stop talking. No one cares

318
00:15:31,439 --> 00:15:32,908
about your stupid movie!

319
00:15:32,993 --> 00:15:34,256
I quit.

320
00:15:47,211 --> 00:15:48,889
Any day now.

321
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:01,526
Come on, come on, come on.

322
00:16:15,565 --> 00:16:17,398
They can really help.
Some of 'em got a good arm.

323
00:16:17,482 --> 00:16:20,240
- Look who it is.
- Jack.

324
00:16:20,325 --> 00:16:21,772
- Coach.
- Kevin.

325
00:16:21,857 --> 00:16:23,967
- I'm so glad you made it.
- Us, too.

326
00:16:24,052 --> 00:16:26,615
Hey, this is Jason and Richard.

327
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,342
They both play for Penn State.

328
00:16:28,427 --> 00:16:29,471
They sure do.

329
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:30,498
They're gonna be, uh,

330
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:32,037
running drills
with us tomorrow.

331
00:16:32,145 --> 00:16:33,470
Yeah, I'm excited to see
what you can do

332
00:16:33,554 --> 00:16:35,121
- on the field, little man.
- Yeah.

333
00:16:35,206 --> 00:16:36,868
It's time to see if anything
I've said in practice

334
00:16:36,952 --> 00:16:38,306
has actually gotten through
to you.

335
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,087
Oh, it has.

336
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:41,455
Yeah, we're ready.

337
00:16:51,005 --> 00:16:52,600
Hey.
You okay?

338
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:02,641
- Did you get a flight yet?
- No.

339
00:17:02,726 --> 00:17:04,945
Not yet. I'm still waiting
for Miguel to call me back.

340
00:17:05,805 --> 00:17:07,451
How's everything going
over there?

341
00:17:07,536 --> 00:17:09,146
The doctor just left.

342
00:17:09,387 --> 00:17:13,040
She said everything
looked totally good and normal.

343
00:17:13,517 --> 00:17:15,780
They're already at a
healthy weight to be born.

344
00:17:15,865 --> 00:17:17,295
Fully cooked.

345
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:20,025
Not even medium rare?

346
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,463
No, perfectly medium.

347
00:17:23,548 --> 00:17:24,941
Just like I like 'em.

348
00:17:25,088 --> 00:17:27,367
- This is getting away from us.
- Yes, it is.

349
00:17:28,669 --> 00:17:31,406
But it's not Braxton-Hicks.

350
00:17:32,042 --> 00:17:34,477
I'm in labor.

351
00:17:34,938 --> 00:17:36,696
The contractions
have slowed down a little bit,

352
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,125
which they said is normal, but, um...

353
00:17:39,346 --> 00:17:42,656
But I am definitely in labor.

354
00:17:43,259 --> 00:17:45,217
They're coming.

355
00:17:48,169 --> 00:17:51,389
Well, you keep
those contractions slow, okay?

356
00:17:51,474 --> 00:17:52,866
Because I'm coming, too.

357
00:17:53,216 --> 00:17:54,827
I'll do my best.

358
00:17:54,912 --> 00:17:56,744
I think it's
time to shift those babies,

359
00:17:56,828 --> 00:17:58,367
like we talked about.

360
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:01,258
Is there anything I can do

361
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:03,345
to help? Um, anyone

362
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:05,281
you want me to talk to?
I mean, I-I know

363
00:18:05,366 --> 00:18:06,650
your entire birth plan,
so if you want

364
00:18:06,734 --> 00:18:08,388
to put a-a nurse or a doctor
on the phone,

365
00:18:08,473 --> 00:18:09,696
- I can walk them through the whole thing.
- Hey, Kevin,

366
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,391
I got to go.
Um, they're gonna put

367
00:18:11,476 --> 00:18:12,568
a bunch of pillows
underneath m to try to change

368
00:18:12,652 --> 00:18:13,852
the babies' position a little.

369
00:18:13,937 --> 00:18:16,461
Labor is crazy.

370
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:19,244
Um, I'll call you later.

371
00:18:19,329 --> 00:18:21,272
Yeah, okay. Um, you know,
I'm here if you need anything.

372
00:18:21,356 --> 00:18:23,742
I can...

373
00:18:36,945 --> 00:18:38,328
Hey. I was just about

374
00:18:38,413 --> 00:18:39,735
to call you.
We got you a flight.

375
00:18:39,893 --> 00:18:42,243
Yes! G-Great. What airport?

376
00:18:42,328 --> 00:18:44,026
Seattle. It boards in two hours

377
00:18:44,126 --> 00:18:45,409
Can you make it?

378
00:18:49,536 --> 00:18:52,191
Yes, I can. Yes, I can make it.
How long's the flight?

379
00:18:52,276 --> 00:18:54,064
- It's two and a half hours.
- Two and a half hours.

380
00:18:54,148 --> 00:18:55,956
Okay, that puts me there
in about...

381
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:57,129
five hours.

382
00:18:57,214 --> 00:18:58,126
First births usually take

383
00:18:58,211 --> 00:18:59,339
a little longer, right?

384
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:01,978
Which means
I am probably gonna make it.

385
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:03,772
Miguel. Miguel, I swear to God,

386
00:19:03,857 --> 00:19:06,381
if you were here right now,
I'd kiss you right on the mouth.

387
00:19:06,466 --> 00:19:07,772
- Thank you.
- I mean,

388
00:19:07,857 --> 00:19:09,384
I would regret it
immediately afterwards,

389
00:19:09,468 --> 00:19:11,074
but in the heat of the moment,
I would kiss you

390
00:19:11,158 --> 00:19:12,566
- right on those beautiful lips.
- Yeah, okay.

391
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:14,348
I'll text you
the boarding pass, okay?

392
00:19:14,522 --> 00:19:16,595
Thank you.
Oh, hey, Miguel,

393
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:18,801
- can I talk to my mom?
- Oh, yeah, of course.

394
00:19:18,886 --> 00:19:20,956
- Wants to talk to you.
- Oh.

395
00:19:22,627 --> 00:19:24,182
Hi, sweetheart.

396
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:27,821
You're having a little bit
of an unexpected adventure, huh?

397
00:19:28,065 --> 00:19:30,061
Yeah.
Not really how I imagined it.

398
00:19:30,146 --> 00:19:33,128
Yeah. It never is.

399
00:19:34,117 --> 00:19:37,363
I just... I wanted
delivery day to be perfect.

400
00:19:37,448 --> 00:19:39,472
You know,
I wanted to be there for her,

401
00:19:39,557 --> 00:19:41,651
waiting on her hand and foot.

402
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,291
I wanted to be like...

403
00:19:45,186 --> 00:19:46,623
Your father.

404
00:19:47,837 --> 00:19:49,104
Kev,

405
00:19:49,697 --> 00:19:51,581
I know you put him
on a pedestal.

406
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:52,978
And-and I don't blame you.

407
00:19:53,143 --> 00:19:55,693
He was a wonderful father.

408
00:19:55,956 --> 00:19:57,480
I pro...

409
00:19:57,932 --> 00:19:59,349
Not on...

410
00:19:59,523 --> 00:20:00,916
My... Bir...

411
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:04,093
- Yeah.
- Are you kidding? Mom?

412
00:20:05,094 --> 00:20:06,794
Mom, you're breaking up
pretty bad. Are you...

413
00:20:06,878 --> 00:20:08,361
I don't even know
if you can hear this, but I...

414
00:20:08,445 --> 00:20:10,432
I'm gonna have to call you...

415
00:20:11,013 --> 00:20:13,315
Oh. Perfect.

416
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,491
Oh, no.

417
00:20:55,116 --> 00:20:56,994
Damn it.

418
00:21:01,452 --> 00:21:03,846
All right.

419
00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:10,987
You know what's always
been the trouble with you?

420
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:15,182
You spend too much time stuck
in that damn head of yours.

421
00:21:15,267 --> 00:21:17,071
Come on!

422
00:21:17,156 --> 00:21:20,028
Go faster. At this rate, we
ain't gonna be home till winter.

423
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:23,128
You know, I told your mother

424
00:21:23,212 --> 00:21:24,674
when you signed up,

425
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,960
we were just throwing our money
down the drain.

426
00:21:27,045 --> 00:21:30,570
But she don't care. She's always
been totally crappy with money.

427
00:21:30,661 --> 00:21:32,181
Shut up!

428
00:21:43,044 --> 00:21:46,003
My lips are sealed there,
hot shot.

429
00:21:54,909 --> 00:21:56,432
Feel a little better?

430
00:21:56,517 --> 00:21:57,750
Yeah.

431
00:22:02,402 --> 00:22:04,883
Must've been Mom's Sloppy Joes.

432
00:22:08,245 --> 00:22:09,834
Kev, what's going on?

433
00:22:12,681 --> 00:22:14,335
What if I suck tomorrow?

434
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,552
You're not gonna suck tomorrow.

435
00:22:17,443 --> 00:22:18,833
But what if I do?

436
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:21,889
What if I'm not actually
that good at football?

437
00:22:24,155 --> 00:22:26,531
That means I have nothing.

438
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:28,799
Nothing?

439
00:22:30,091 --> 00:22:32,255
Kev, what are you talking about?

440
00:22:34,764 --> 00:22:36,959
You and Mom talk about it
all the time.

441
00:22:37,124 --> 00:22:39,574
Randall's a genius,
and all I have is football.

442
00:22:39,748 --> 00:22:41,523
That is not all you have.

443
00:22:41,608 --> 00:22:43,926
I heard you and Mom talking
the other day.

444
00:22:44,874 --> 00:22:46,806
You told her I was soft.

445
00:22:53,669 --> 00:22:57,666
Look, I don't know exactly
what you overheard,

446
00:22:57,921 --> 00:23:00,193
but that's not what I meant.

447
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:02,367
Yes, it is,
or you wouldn't be here.

448
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,420
What is that supposed to mean?

449
00:23:07,723 --> 00:23:09,865
We never do anything
alone together.

450
00:23:10,045 --> 00:23:14,006
But you took the time
to bring me here, because...

451
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:17,623
you think that football's
my only shot at being special.

452
00:23:19,037 --> 00:23:20,865
That's what you think I think?

453
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:22,944
I know that's what you think.

454
00:23:23,139 --> 00:23:26,404
And Coach doesn't think
I have what it takes.

455
00:23:26,779 --> 00:23:28,536
He just yells at me
all the time.

456
00:23:28,881 --> 00:23:31,757
He... That's just his style,
Kev, okay?

457
00:23:31,842 --> 00:23:33,191
Coach is old-school.

458
00:23:33,321 --> 00:23:34,670
He wouldn't have
brought you here

459
00:23:34,755 --> 00:23:36,172
if he didn't think
you were good enough.

460
00:23:36,256 --> 00:23:38,084
He calls me names, and...

461
00:23:38,728 --> 00:23:40,556
he says I'm stupid.

462
00:23:42,185 --> 00:23:43,920
He calls you "stupid"?

463
00:23:44,211 --> 00:23:46,387
Kevin?

464
00:23:47,272 --> 00:23:50,645
He tells me I'm stupid pretty
much every day of my life.

465
00:23:59,727 --> 00:24:01,166
You know what? Let's, um...

466
00:24:03,115 --> 00:24:04,846
Let's go get you some food,
okay?

467
00:24:04,931 --> 00:24:06,759
Let's settle that stomach
of yours.

468
00:24:06,858 --> 00:24:08,783
- Dad, I'm not hungry.
- Come on.

469
00:24:09,626 --> 00:24:11,132
I have a super early morning.

470
00:24:11,217 --> 00:24:12,312
I think I should just go to bed.

471
00:24:12,396 --> 00:24:13,874
Get your sweater. Let's go.

472
00:24:23,069 --> 00:24:24,462
Thank God.

473
00:24:25,699 --> 00:24:27,168
We got to get you out of here.

474
00:24:27,253 --> 00:24:29,101
- Call an ambulance!
- No, I can't get a signal.

475
00:24:29,185 --> 00:24:31,105
You're gonna be all right,
though, okay?

476
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:32,747
I'll get you to a hospital.

477
00:24:32,831 --> 00:24:34,398
Gonna get you out of here.
Come on.

478
00:24:36,996 --> 00:24:38,878
All right. Come on.

479
00:24:39,155 --> 00:24:41,157
- Come on, come on!
- My leg is stuck.

480
00:24:41,242 --> 00:24:42,730
It hurts really bad.

481
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:46,317
Okay, listen. Listen to me.
Listen to me.

482
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:48,895
On the count of three, I'm gonna
pull up on the steering wheel,

483
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,287
- and you're gonna pry your leg out, okay?
- Oh, God. Okay.

484
00:24:50,371 --> 00:24:53,230
Breathe. Just breathe.
Listen to me. One, two, three.

485
00:24:53,315 --> 00:24:55,099
Go, go. Come on. Come on.

486
00:24:55,362 --> 00:24:57,002
There you go.

487
00:24:57,087 --> 00:24:59,263
All right. Come on. I got you.

488
00:24:59,356 --> 00:25:01,358
Come on. Here we go.

489
00:25:04,257 --> 00:25:07,541
Hey. Hey!

490
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,552
Oh, damn it. Okay.

491
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:22,261
Hey. Listen to me.
You're all right.

492
00:25:22,418 --> 00:25:24,121
I'm gonna get you out
of here, okay?

493
00:25:24,807 --> 00:25:26,330
Hey, come on.

494
00:25:26,416 --> 00:25:28,076
Come with me. Got to get you
to a hospital. Come on.

495
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,727
Hey, let's go.

496
00:25:29,812 --> 00:25:31,596
We got this. Let's go.

497
00:25:48,909 --> 00:25:52,448
Hi. Um, want to eat
at the bar with your old man?

498
00:25:52,533 --> 00:25:54,674
- Yeah.
- We're... Thanks.

499
00:25:54,783 --> 00:25:56,416
Go on, pick a seat.

500
00:26:00,409 --> 00:26:05,439
Hi. We're gonna get two New York
strips, uh, medium... rare?

501
00:26:05,642 --> 00:26:07,807
- A side of onion rings?
- Yeah.

502
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:09,229
And two Cokes.

503
00:26:09,328 --> 00:26:11,150
- Sure thing.
- Thanks.

504
00:26:15,892 --> 00:26:17,665
This place is pretty cool.

505
00:26:18,073 --> 00:26:19,634
Yeah.

506
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:25,243
<i>âª Every time... âª</i>

507
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,047
Listen to me.

508
00:26:27,416 --> 00:26:31,267
Yes, when you made starting
quarterback, I was psyched,

509
00:26:31,361 --> 00:26:33,301
because it was exciting
to watch you shine.

510
00:26:33,386 --> 00:26:38,130
But Kevin, football is not
the only thing that you have.

511
00:26:38,565 --> 00:26:40,351
Do you understand?

512
00:26:40,525 --> 00:26:41,807
Yeah.

513
00:26:43,087 --> 00:26:44,314
Two Cokes.

514
00:26:44,572 --> 00:26:48,774
<i>âª Won't you stay? âª</i>

515
00:27:02,852 --> 00:27:07,244
You know, my dad used to come
to my Little League games.

516
00:27:08,268 --> 00:27:09,700
Never missed them.

517
00:27:11,104 --> 00:27:13,384
It was the one thing
he always showed up for.

518
00:27:14,395 --> 00:27:18,530
And he made them
a living hell for me.

519
00:27:19,877 --> 00:27:22,643
He'd get drunker and drunker,

520
00:27:22,728 --> 00:27:24,604
inning by inning.

521
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,799
If my team won,
at least he was a happy drunk,

522
00:27:28,704 --> 00:27:30,635
slapping me on the arm

523
00:27:31,041 --> 00:27:33,955
and calling me "Jackie Boy"
the whole ride home.

524
00:27:35,276 --> 00:27:37,887
But if we lost...

525
00:27:41,455 --> 00:27:46,018
I started praying
before every game.

526
00:27:46,417 --> 00:27:49,768
'Cause a good game meant
a good car ride home.

527
00:27:53,227 --> 00:27:58,275
Baseball, this thing
that I loved...

528
00:27:58,958 --> 00:28:00,744
it became all about him.

529
00:28:01,862 --> 00:28:03,932
I mean, ev-every pitch I threw,

530
00:28:04,032 --> 00:28:06,549
I could... I could hear
his voice in my ear.

531
00:28:06,675 --> 00:28:07,763
You know?

532
00:28:07,945 --> 00:28:09,580
"Don't screw this up, Jack."

533
00:28:11,049 --> 00:28:12,861
"Get out of your head, Jack."

534
00:28:14,028 --> 00:28:16,815
"What a waste
of a Sunday, Jack."

535
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:22,372
I didn't know he was like that.

536
00:28:22,457 --> 00:28:24,677
Mm. Yeah.

537
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:29,057
You never really
talk about him.

538
00:28:30,366 --> 00:28:33,249
Yeah, well,
being out on the road

539
00:28:33,334 --> 00:28:36,221
and sitting at a bar with my son

540
00:28:36,463 --> 00:28:38,165
makes a guy want to open up.

541
00:28:43,291 --> 00:28:47,121
Yeah, he-he wasn't all bad,
my dad.

542
00:28:49,181 --> 00:28:53,138
Uh, that's what makes
our parents loom so large

543
00:28:53,223 --> 00:28:55,138
in our heads, I think.

544
00:28:55,312 --> 00:28:56,721
They're...

545
00:28:57,618 --> 00:29:00,018
a million things to us
all at once.

546
00:29:10,543 --> 00:29:12,110
Not bad.

547
00:29:13,596 --> 00:29:15,637
Didn't know you had it in you.

548
00:29:17,685 --> 00:29:19,862
Indy 500, watch out.

549
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:22,924
Keys.

550
00:29:33,785 --> 00:29:35,854
And even
after they're long gone,

551
00:29:36,978 --> 00:29:38,830
we're stuck with them.

552
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:44,143
Can't help it.
They're inside of us.

553
00:29:50,959 --> 00:29:53,440
You know, my whole life,
I promised myself

554
00:29:53,544 --> 00:29:55,354
I'd be nothing like him, but...

555
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:00,736
...here I am, putting all
this pressure on you,

556
00:30:00,845 --> 00:30:04,229
making you so nervous,
you're sick.

557
00:30:06,407 --> 00:30:08,268
I ended up just like him.

558
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:13,087
No, Dad.

559
00:30:13,889 --> 00:30:15,690
You're way better than him.

560
00:30:19,415 --> 00:30:20,946
Thank you, my son.

561
00:30:24,205 --> 00:30:26,236
And you're gonna be
way better than me.

562
00:30:27,796 --> 00:30:29,244
Maybe.

563
00:30:55,143 --> 00:30:56,999
Well, I'm gonna go
to the bathroom, bud.

564
00:30:57,173 --> 00:31:00,437
Uh, don't pick up any girls
while I'm gone.

565
00:31:07,871 --> 00:31:09,197
Coach?

566
00:31:09,976 --> 00:31:11,502
Oh, hey, Jack.

567
00:31:11,712 --> 00:31:13,322
Hey, Kevin excited?

568
00:31:13,407 --> 00:31:15,148
Oh, it's a big day tomorrow.

569
00:31:15,326 --> 00:31:18,837
I want you to know, I'm not
gonna miss a game this season.

570
00:31:19,151 --> 00:31:20,492
Well, of course not.

571
00:31:20,689 --> 00:31:22,430
I mean, got to watch your boy,
right?

572
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:25,027
I'm not just gonna be
watching him.

573
00:31:29,607 --> 00:31:31,435
Don't ever call my kid stupid.

574
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:33,377
Ever.

575
00:31:35,176 --> 00:31:38,614
- Jack...
- Tell me you understand.

576
00:32:09,729 --> 00:32:10,729
Hey, Coach.

577
00:32:10,899 --> 00:32:12,204
Hey, Kevin.

578
00:32:12,433 --> 00:32:14,522
See you tomorrow.

579
00:32:20,776 --> 00:32:22,302
Hey.

580
00:32:22,476 --> 00:32:23,979
Coach was here.

581
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,572
Yeah.

582
00:32:26,523 --> 00:32:28,395
Did you see him?

583
00:32:28,483 --> 00:32:31,312
- In the bathroom?
- Yeah, for a minute.

584
00:32:32,616 --> 00:32:34,879
- Mmm.
- Did you say something to him?

585
00:32:35,201 --> 00:32:36,697
Nope.

586
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,869
Mmm. Now, that's good.

587
00:32:46,016 --> 00:32:48,221
Yeah. I like it a little bloody.

588
00:33:09,392 --> 00:33:11,873
Hey, it's
Madison. Leave a message.

589
00:33:13,417 --> 00:33:15,869
Hey, I'm checking in. Uh...

590
00:33:18,326 --> 00:33:20,110
Boy, do I have a story for you.

591
00:33:21,934 --> 00:33:25,024
Anyway, uh, Miguel got me
on a flight out of Seattle.

592
00:33:25,188 --> 00:33:27,979
I think I can make it. Um...

593
00:33:28,977 --> 00:33:30,457
Hey, I'm really trying here.

594
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:32,021
You know? Um...

595
00:33:33,479 --> 00:33:36,197
Just call me when you get this,
if you can.

596
00:33:38,479 --> 00:33:40,638
Wait a second.

597
00:33:40,968 --> 00:33:42,492
Aren't you...

598
00:33:43,818 --> 00:33:45,760
Kevin Pearson, yeah.

599
00:33:46,644 --> 00:33:48,776
Life is so weird.

600
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:50,799
Yeah.

601
00:33:52,945 --> 00:33:55,179
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey.
Let's keep talking.

602
00:33:55,264 --> 00:33:57,138
Look at... five minutes.
We got five minutes, okay?

603
00:33:57,222 --> 00:33:58,956
We're at the hospital
in five minutes.

604
00:33:59,041 --> 00:34:01,711
Just keep talk... um...

605
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,116
That was my fiancÃ©e,
on the phone there.

606
00:34:04,201 --> 00:34:07,877
She's-she's pregnant. She's
in labor, actually, with twins.

607
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,558
And I'm probably gonna
miss my flight.

608
00:34:11,643 --> 00:34:15,347
Which means I'm gonna miss
my children being born.

609
00:34:15,432 --> 00:34:17,199
Which means I'm gonna miss
the most important moment

610
00:34:17,283 --> 00:34:18,571
of their lives.

611
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:22,392
I have three teenagers.

612
00:34:22,547 --> 00:34:25,352
They don't remember anything
before kindergarten.

613
00:34:26,321 --> 00:34:28,758
This is not the most
important day of their lives.

614
00:34:28,906 --> 00:34:32,111
They're not
even gonna remember it.

615
00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:36,063
You're rich, you're famous.

616
00:34:36,993 --> 00:34:39,344
You're gonna be
their freakin' idol.

617
00:34:42,529 --> 00:34:44,574
None of that stuff matters, man.

618
00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:46,499
You know, my dad wasn't
either of those things.

619
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:48,194
He was just there.

620
00:34:48,948 --> 00:34:50,423
Always.

621
00:34:53,844 --> 00:34:58,111
My dad was the most there person
that ever lived.

622
00:34:59,768 --> 00:35:02,430
Everything that I do,
I do with his voice in my head.

623
00:35:06,151 --> 00:35:07,635
He would have
rescued you tonight,

624
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,861
he would've saved you.

625
00:35:10,797 --> 00:35:13,071
And he would have made it
to the births, he would've...

626
00:35:15,133 --> 00:35:17,164
figured out a way to do it all.

627
00:35:21,051 --> 00:35:23,704
He believed I could be
that kind of person, too.

628
00:35:32,811 --> 00:35:34,856
Hey! Little help?

629
00:35:34,941 --> 00:35:37,055
We need a wheelchair.

630
00:36:01,594 --> 00:36:03,697
Hey, listen, my phone
is about ready to die

631
00:36:03,782 --> 00:36:05,041
but I made it to the airport.

632
00:36:05,126 --> 00:36:06,549
I think I'm gonna make it there
in time, Madison.

633
00:36:06,633 --> 00:36:09,422
I can feel it, okay?
Hang tight, bye.

634
00:36:09,574 --> 00:36:11,571
Hey. I'm TSA PreCheck.

635
00:36:11,751 --> 00:36:13,930
- Great. Just need your ID.
- Yeah.

636
00:36:17,225 --> 00:36:18,547
Oh, you got to be kidding.

637
00:36:19,304 --> 00:36:21,654
No, no, no, no... oh, um...

638
00:36:24,413 --> 00:36:26,284
Oh, no. Okay... uh...

639
00:36:26,731 --> 00:36:27,955
There was an accident.

640
00:36:28,317 --> 00:36:29,735
There-there was an accident.

641
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,375
You're not gonna believe this,
but there was an accident.

642
00:36:31,415 --> 00:36:33,008
I had to pull a guy
out of his car

643
00:36:33,125 --> 00:36:34,485
and drive him to the hospital.

644
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,035
Wow, that's amazing.

645
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,905
Thank you.
Yeah, it's just that my, um,

646
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:39,986
my-my ID, it was in my jacket,

647
00:36:40,071 --> 00:36:43,533
and the jacket... I gave...
I gave that man my jacket.

648
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:45,598
Or-or it fell out or something...
Anyway, I...

649
00:36:46,383 --> 00:36:47,813
I don't have my ID on me.

650
00:36:48,524 --> 00:36:50,575
I'm so sorry, sir.
I can't let you on the plane

651
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:52,400
without your ID.

652
00:36:53,681 --> 00:36:56,031
Right, yeah, it's just, um...

653
00:36:57,101 --> 00:36:58,606
Look, uh...

654
00:36:59,971 --> 00:37:02,981
I'm Kevin Pearson,
I'm-I'm a public figure.

655
00:37:03,218 --> 00:37:05,863
I'm not trying to say that
to get special treatment,

656
00:37:05,948 --> 00:37:07,733
I'm-I'm saying that
because it's just, you know,

657
00:37:07,817 --> 00:37:09,911
it's... you can look me up,
it's very easy to figure out

658
00:37:09,995 --> 00:37:11,518
who I am,
you can look me up online.

659
00:37:11,603 --> 00:37:13,562
My whole damn life is online.

660
00:37:14,392 --> 00:37:16,532
That's not really how it works.

661
00:37:16,731 --> 00:37:19,610
There's an office where
you can request an emergency ID.

662
00:37:19,801 --> 00:37:21,717
- Usually takes about a day.
- I don't have a day.

663
00:37:21,801 --> 00:37:24,369
Okay? My fiancÃ©e right now is in
Los Angeles and she's in labor.

664
00:37:24,454 --> 00:37:25,847
I need to get to her, please.

665
00:37:25,941 --> 00:37:27,943
You got to let me
on that flight.

666
00:37:29,419 --> 00:37:31,552
I'm really sorry.
I wish I could help,

667
00:37:31,637 --> 00:37:33,575
but it's really not up to me.

668
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:41,864
Listen, I can't start off
by not being there for them.

669
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:44,482
You need to understand that.

670
00:37:58,763 --> 00:38:01,026
I can't. I don't...

671
00:38:02,414 --> 00:38:04,244
I don't know how else
to explain it to you, okay?

672
00:38:04,328 --> 00:38:06,330
It will break me.

673
00:38:11,286 --> 00:38:12,516
I'm begging you, please,

674
00:38:12,601 --> 00:38:14,951
figure out a way
to get me on that flight.

675
00:38:22,053 --> 00:38:23,727
Only three centimeters.

676
00:38:23,812 --> 00:38:25,466
We have a ways to go.

677
00:38:25,551 --> 00:38:28,946
But these things can speed up
quickly sometimes.

678
00:38:29,162 --> 00:38:30,844
There's really no telling.

679
00:38:31,012 --> 00:38:33,039
Hang in there.

680
00:38:36,854 --> 00:38:38,407
Everything okay?

681
00:38:40,627 --> 00:38:42,263
I just, um,

682
00:38:43,795 --> 00:38:47,102
I can't believe
I'm maybe gonna do this alone.

683
00:38:47,277 --> 00:38:48,930
Why don't you call someone?

684
00:38:49,104 --> 00:38:51,381
Mom, friend?

685
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,567
It might help pass the time.

686
00:38:54,955 --> 00:38:56,559
I'm not close to my mom.

687
00:38:57,417 --> 00:39:00,072
Or anyone in my family, really.

688
00:39:01,857 --> 00:39:03,994
To be honest, there's really
only two people in the world

689
00:39:04,078 --> 00:39:07,241
I am truly close to, and, um...

690
00:39:08,131 --> 00:39:10,496
well, one of them is having
a baby of her own

691
00:39:11,513 --> 00:39:15,263
and the other
is hopefully on a plane.

692
00:39:15,609 --> 00:39:17,611
But who knows?
I can't reach him.

693
00:39:18,451 --> 00:39:20,919
I have to check
on my other mamas,

694
00:39:21,004 --> 00:39:23,706
but I'll come back
as soon as I can, okay?

695
00:39:44,529 --> 00:39:45,591
Hello?

696
00:39:45,731 --> 00:39:48,516
Hi, Madison. It's Randall.

697
00:39:48,661 --> 00:39:50,912
- And Beth.
- And Beth.

698
00:39:51,032 --> 00:39:54,388
Um, I spoke to Kevin.

699
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:56,391
I know he's trying
to get to you,

700
00:39:56,476 --> 00:39:59,439
but we just wanted to say
if you need anything

701
00:39:59,524 --> 00:40:02,836
in the meantime,
don't hesitate to call.

702
00:40:03,268 --> 00:40:05,824
Uh, we're still driving back
from New Orleans,

703
00:40:05,909 --> 00:40:09,739
so if you want us to have
some food sent over there

704
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,837
or anything,

705
00:40:12,875 --> 00:40:16,688
we-we just want you to know
that we're here.

706
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,879
Okay.

707
00:40:21,004 --> 00:40:24,181
Uh, thank you.

708
00:40:27,846 --> 00:40:30,391
Um, or if you want,

709
00:40:30,618 --> 00:40:33,330
we can stay on the phone
with you for a while.

710
00:40:33,773 --> 00:40:34,817
No.

711
00:40:34,903 --> 00:40:37,557
No, no, um, I'm-I'm fine.

712
00:40:38,547 --> 00:40:40,029
You sure?

713
00:40:42,164 --> 00:40:45,055
Madison, we really can
stay on with you.

714
00:40:46,021 --> 00:40:47,521
You're family.

715
00:41:01,188 --> 00:41:02,375
Okay.

716
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,853
Um...

717
00:41:04,411 --> 00:41:07,270
Yeah, that'd be
really nice, actually.

718
00:41:07,586 --> 00:41:09,211
<i>Of course.</i>

719
00:41:09,505 --> 00:41:11,286
<i>As long as you need.</i>
