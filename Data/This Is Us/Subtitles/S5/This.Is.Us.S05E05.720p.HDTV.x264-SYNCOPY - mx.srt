3
00:00:03,761 --> 00:00:04,936
it's kind of going viral.

00:00:05,021 --> 00:00:06,417
<i>Well, viral how?</i>

5
00:00:07,993 --> 00:00:09,656
<i>I'm doing this
for William Hill.</i>

6
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,651
<i>Because you all
were his family,</i>

7
00:00:13,025 --> 00:00:14,846
<i>which means
you're my family, too.</i>

8
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:16,901
It's twins, Kevin.

9
00:00:17,481 --> 00:00:19,299
I'm all in, Madison.

10
00:00:19,777 --> 00:00:21,779
Whatever you need,
I am all in.

11
00:00:21,893 --> 00:00:23,174
I think
I just got the part.

12
00:00:23,259 --> 00:00:25,393
I mean, pending a-a good meeting
with the director.

13
00:00:25,478 --> 00:00:27,409
I-I got the part.

14
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:29,188
Um, my talk with Ellie today

15
00:00:29,273 --> 00:00:30,885
brought up some stuff for me.

16
00:00:31,737 --> 00:00:34,190
When I was 18,
I was in

17
00:00:34,275 --> 00:00:37,010
a really,
really bad relationship.

18
00:00:37,597 --> 00:00:39,299
And when it ended...

19
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,721
So you're telling me,
that this boyfriend of yours...

20
00:00:57,218 --> 00:00:58,924
Got me pregnant,
yeah.

21
00:01:00,813 --> 00:01:03,946
And I was nowhere near ready
to be a mom.

22
00:01:05,534 --> 00:01:06,737
And I could not...

23
00:01:06,995 --> 00:01:10,003
Ooh, I could not be tied to that
guy for the rest of my life.

24
00:01:11,346 --> 00:01:12,776
You know, so...

25
00:01:14,065 --> 00:01:15,596
I had an abortion.

26
00:01:18,177 --> 00:01:20,479
And it was,
I mean, the toughest decision

27
00:01:20,593 --> 00:01:22,299
I've ever made
in my life.

28
00:01:22,885 --> 00:01:24,237
But I don't regret it.

29
00:01:25,737 --> 00:01:28,057
But I made it alone, and

30
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:30,190
you know,
I've lived with it alone.

31
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:35,284
Wait. What are your eyes doing?
Are you judging me?

32
00:01:36,415 --> 00:01:37,667
No.

33
00:01:38,455 --> 00:01:40,096
No, of course not.

34
00:01:42,151 --> 00:01:45,689
I'm just trying
to wrap my head around the...

35
00:01:46,842 --> 00:01:49,758
Uh, why did it take you so long
to tell me this?

36
00:01:51,088 --> 00:01:52,841
Well, it's not exactly something

37
00:01:52,929 --> 00:01:55,565
that comes up
naturally in a conversation.

38
00:01:56,112 --> 00:01:57,901
Actually, it is.

39
00:01:59,662 --> 00:02:02,143
It took us two years
to have Jack.

40
00:02:02,651 --> 00:02:06,768
That's two years of talking
about pregnancy all the time.

41
00:02:07,635 --> 00:02:09,503
Toby, you don't understand.

42
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,432
I was 18 years old,

43
00:02:11,557 --> 00:02:15,628
and that decision was wrapped up
in the darkest,

44
00:02:15,792 --> 00:02:20,729
lowest, most painful...
time of my life.

45
00:02:20,814 --> 00:02:23,729
It was, like, the most painful
relationship of my life.

46
00:02:23,814 --> 00:02:26,370
And all I wanted to do,
I wanted to lock it up,

47
00:02:26,643 --> 00:02:28,105
you know, and I didn't want
to think about it.

48
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,159
I didn't want
to think about him.

49
00:02:31,782 --> 00:02:34,987
He was so cruel...
to me.

50
00:02:37,305 --> 00:02:39,409
I would like you
to tell me his name,

51
00:02:40,463 --> 00:02:42,884
and then, I would like
to find him,

52
00:02:43,393 --> 00:02:45,057
and I would like to kill him.

53
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,750
- Babe.
- I want to kill him.

54
00:02:46,835 --> 00:02:48,053
You're...

55
00:02:48,138 --> 00:02:50,385
Thank you.
That's very sweet.

56
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:51,540
You know what?

57
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:53,409
He's in the past,
it's all in the past.

58
00:02:53,494 --> 00:02:56,207
- It's...
- Is it, though? If it was

59
00:02:56,292 --> 00:02:59,464
truly in the past, then why
would it take you four years

60
00:02:59,549 --> 00:03:00,807
to tell me about it?

I'm telling you.

66
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,378
Natasha is going to plotz
when she sees our nursery.

67
00:03:43,463 --> 00:03:45,813
You are obsessed
with impressing this nanny.

68
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:48,285
I thought we were interviewing
her, not the other way around.

69
00:03:48,369 --> 00:03:49,597
Yeah, no, babe,
you don't understand.

70
00:03:49,681 --> 00:03:52,699
Natasha is, like, um...
She's, like, nanny royalty.

71
00:03:52,784 --> 00:03:55,383
Okay? Timberlake said
that he and Jess...

72
00:03:55,488 --> 00:03:57,708
They wept when she left
to go to another family.

73
00:03:57,793 --> 00:03:59,815
Now that's what
my family deserves, does it not?

74
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,721
A nanny that makes
Timberlake weep?

75
00:04:01,806 --> 00:04:03,714
Like a little baby.

76
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,351
Yeah, what's up?

77
00:04:08,788 --> 00:04:09,971
Yeah, okay.

78
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:13,291
No. Hold on, hold on.
No, no, no, no, no.

79
00:04:13,376 --> 00:04:14,995
That is not
what I committed to.

80
00:04:15,471 --> 00:04:16,589
Then I'm out.

81
00:04:16,831 --> 00:04:18,182
Yeah, you know why.

82
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:20,245
I'm not having
this conversation.

83
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:22,089
Goodbye.

84
00:04:27,753 --> 00:04:30,496
Read about these, uh...
What were they?

85
00:04:30,581 --> 00:04:32,839
These, uh... these, uh...
these baby monitor socks

86
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,678
- that they have. They...
- Kevin.

87
00:04:35,195 --> 00:04:36,956
What the hell just happened
on the phone?

88
00:04:37,526 --> 00:04:40,870
Uh, th-that was, uh,
just my agent.

89
00:04:42,221 --> 00:04:43,277
They, uh, they're moving

90
00:04:43,362 --> 00:04:45,697
the filming of the movie
to Vancouver, 'cause it's safer.

91
00:04:45,782 --> 00:04:47,566
I guess
there's less COVID, so...

92
00:04:48,151 --> 00:04:50,183
And that's bad because...?

93
00:04:50,268 --> 00:04:52,223
Because it's two weeks
of filming, right?

94
00:04:52,308 --> 00:04:54,448
Plus, two weeks quarantine,

95
00:04:54,814 --> 00:04:56,753
which means
I'd have to leave L.A. tomorrow.

96
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,273
Oh.

97
00:04:59,604 --> 00:05:02,362
Yeah, so, I-I, you know,
I can't do it.

98
00:05:07,049 --> 00:05:08,421
Wait. Put that down.

99
00:05:08,506 --> 00:05:10,156
Let's do the math for a second.

100
00:05:10,241 --> 00:05:12,765
Four weeks away
puts you back here...

101
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:16,339
a solid five weeks
before the babies are due.

102
00:05:19,761 --> 00:05:22,869
You have worked
so hard on this movie.

103
00:05:23,018 --> 00:05:25,721
You have put up with so much
crap from that director.

104
00:05:26,786 --> 00:05:28,776
This can't all be for nothing.

105
00:05:31,573 --> 00:05:33,565
I don't know.
I don't know.

106
00:05:39,924 --> 00:05:41,714
Go on and pack.

107
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:45,604
Yeah.

108
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:58,604
No, Mom, I didn't realize
the camera was still on.

109
00:05:58,957 --> 00:06:01,471
I can give Miguel my abs routine.

110
00:06:01,555 --> 00:06:03,557

All right, Jae-won.

00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,743
You can put your tinypecs
back on now.

116
00:06:21,025 --> 00:06:22,983
Uh, there's something
I need to show you.

117
00:06:23,188 --> 00:06:25,632
I don't know if I would have
said that while closing a door,

118
00:06:25,717 --> 00:06:27,240
wearing a naked-man shirt.

119
00:06:27,325 --> 00:06:29,714
Yeah. Uh, you know the,
um...

120
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:32,105
the form we set up
on our website for cons...

121
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:34,499
for, uh, constituents
to reach out?

122
00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:37,792
Aah. Uh, watch the hair.

123
00:06:38,245 --> 00:06:39,606
Yeah.

124
00:06:40,174 --> 00:06:41,332
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

125
00:06:41,417 --> 00:06:43,933
The, um...
the form on our website

126
00:06:44,018 --> 00:06:45,339
for constituents to reach out.

127
00:06:47,644 --> 00:06:49,124
This came in.

128
00:06:54,484 --> 00:06:56,182
You want privacy?

129
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,034
I'll give you privacy.

130
00:07:12,998 --> 00:07:14,131
Kate Pearson?

131
00:07:15,326 --> 00:07:16,263
- I'm Dr. Wolfe.

132
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:17,771
I'm one of the
clinicians here.

133
00:07:17,945 --> 00:07:19,451
- Hi.
- Hi.

134
00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:22,370
So, let me tell you
how this is gonna go.

135
00:07:22,455 --> 00:07:23,935
Uh, by Pennsylvania law,

136
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,173
I'm required to ask you
this list of questions

137
00:07:26,258 --> 00:07:28,101
before we can proceed
any further.

138
00:07:28,186 --> 00:07:29,709
- Okay.
- Okay.

139
00:07:30,811 --> 00:07:32,481
Are you absolutely sure

140
00:07:32,566 --> 00:07:34,917
of your decision
to terminate this pregnancy?

141
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:37,178
Yes.

142
00:07:37,803 --> 00:07:40,154
Can you tell me
what led to your decision?

143
00:07:41,534 --> 00:07:43,381
Um... I'm 18,

144
00:07:43,466 --> 00:07:45,816
and I'm not
with the guy anymore, so...

145
00:07:46,836 --> 00:07:49,858
Are you taking any medications
or other drugs?

146
00:07:52,022 --> 00:07:53,178
Kate?

147
00:07:55,218 --> 00:07:58,304
Um, so where do they actually
do it?

148
00:07:58,389 --> 00:07:59,428
Will it be in here?

149
00:07:59,595 --> 00:08:02,827
No. The procedure would happen
in the room next door.

150
00:08:02,912 --> 00:08:05,209
And that happens
today, right?

151
00:08:05,294 --> 00:08:07,929
- Mm.
<i>- No, honey. We're legally required</i>

152
00:08:08,014 --> 00:08:10,765
<i>to wait 24 hours
after meeting the patient</i>

153
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:13,296
<i>and giving the questions
and information.</i>

154
00:08:13,381 --> 00:08:16,397
<i>If after 24 hours, you
feel you want the procedure...</i>

155
00:08:19,109 --> 00:08:20,943
- Babe?
- Hi.

156
00:08:22,623 --> 00:08:23,701
Where's Jackie?

157
00:08:23,786 --> 00:08:26,102
Ugh. Conked out
in his sleep chair.

158
00:08:26,187 --> 00:08:27,459
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

159
00:08:27,544 --> 00:08:29,372
You look pretty tired
yourself.

160
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,741
Well, that's because
I spent the entire night

161
00:08:34,826 --> 00:08:37,938
cyber-stalking
my awful ex-boyfriend Marc.

162
00:08:39,303 --> 00:08:41,022
I don't know.
I just...

163
00:08:41,397 --> 00:08:43,209
I just felt like...

164
00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:44,725
I don't know...
you were right.

165
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:47,209
Right, like, I was clearly
not past the past.

166
00:08:47,365 --> 00:08:50,615
And that's why I took out
my laptop, I went for a dive,

167
00:08:50,975 --> 00:08:53,606
and I found out
that he's in San Diego.

168
00:08:53,811 --> 00:08:55,347
So I was thinking.

169
00:08:55,521 --> 00:08:57,610
I don't know what I'm gonna say
or what I'm gonna do,

170
00:08:57,695 --> 00:08:59,392
but I-I feel like
I have to see him.

171
00:09:01,076 --> 00:09:03,137
I was hoping
you would come with.

172
00:09:03,686 --> 00:09:07,098
I know it's a lot to ask, but
I could really use your support.

173
00:09:08,865 --> 00:09:10,951
Are you sure
you can handle seeing him again?

174
00:09:12,412 --> 00:09:13,748
Yeah.

175
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:16,475
Okay. I'm in.

176
00:09:17,186 --> 00:09:19,318
- Okay.
- Okay.

177
00:09:31,513 --> 00:09:33,438
<i>Hi. You've reached the Pearsons.</i>

178
00:09:33,522 --> 00:09:35,178
<i>Leave us a message.</i>

179
00:09:35,263 --> 00:09:36,530
Hey, sweetheart.
It's me.

180
00:09:36,614 --> 00:09:38,443
Just calling
to check in.

181
00:09:38,528 --> 00:09:42,998
Um... Kevin did really great
at his showcase last night.

182
00:09:43,272 --> 00:09:46,006
And then he tried to set me
up with his acting teacher.

183
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,358
Is everything okay?

184
00:09:50,704 --> 00:09:53,131
I thought you said
you'd be home.

185
00:09:53,535 --> 00:09:56,312
Well, I'm at Kevin's
if you need me, all right?

186
00:09:56,397 --> 00:09:58,265
I love you. Bye, Bug.

187
00:10:12,013 --> 00:10:13,939
This is so lovely.

188
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,123
Are we celebrating
something?

189
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,023
- Kevin's got great news.
- Mm-hmm.

190
00:10:18,107 --> 00:10:20,521
- Oh.
- I got a call from a talent manager.

191
00:10:20,606 --> 00:10:22,437
She was at
my showcase last night.

192
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:25,567
And she said that I have
the right look for TV.

193
00:10:25,652 --> 00:10:27,397
Oh, so,
she's more of a looks manager.

194
00:10:27,513 --> 00:10:30,973
- Okay, let him talk.
- That's great, sweetheart.

195
00:10:31,058 --> 00:10:33,171
And she says it's pilot season,

196
00:10:33,256 --> 00:10:34,561
and she wants me
to go to L.A.

197
00:10:34,646 --> 00:10:37,023
for a few months
so she can send me on auditions.

198
00:10:37,108 --> 00:10:38,537
- L.A.?
- Uh-huh.

199
00:10:38,622 --> 00:10:41,553
But you just got to New York.

200
00:10:42,006 --> 00:10:43,108
Yeah.

201
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:46,181
Well, what about you?
Will you be going with him?

202
00:10:46,337 --> 00:10:48,334
Oh, um, I have school, so...

203
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:49,436
Yeah, and I'll be back

204
00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:51,329
- before she can even miss me.
- Yeah.

205
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,600
Mm.

206
00:10:56,053 --> 00:10:57,185
To Kevin.

207
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:59,529
To your career.

208
00:10:59,732 --> 00:11:01,603
- Thanks, Mom.
- To your career.

209
00:11:01,688 --> 00:11:02,998
- To your career.
- To my career.

210
00:11:04,256 --> 00:11:05,459
And because of my profession,

211
00:11:05,544 --> 00:11:07,089
I get tested
multiple times a week.

212
00:11:07,174 --> 00:11:08,764
I quarantine strictly.

213
00:11:08,849 --> 00:11:12,312
I'm basically the loneliest,
safest person on the planet.

214
00:11:12,397 --> 00:11:13,625
You're funny.

215
00:11:13,709 --> 00:11:15,123
That's funny.
She is funny,

216
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,154
- right?
- She is.

217
00:11:17,623 --> 00:11:19,186
Um, and do you know CPR?

218
00:11:19,271 --> 00:11:20,772
And pediatric first aid.

219
00:11:20,857 --> 00:11:22,493
- Recertified every year.
- That is

220
00:11:22,577 --> 00:11:24,622
- so reassuring, I can't tell you.
- Unbelievable.

221
00:11:24,707 --> 00:11:25,944
And you're good
with extended travel,

222
00:11:26,028 --> 00:11:27,318
right?
Because nowadays,

223
00:11:27,403 --> 00:11:28,671
you never know where
these movies are gonna shoot.

224
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:30,561
- So...
- My passport's always up-to-date.

225
00:11:30,646 --> 00:11:32,392
Oh, that's great. That's great,
because we want someone

226
00:11:32,476 --> 00:11:34,843
who travels with us to keep
things consistent for the twins.

227
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:36,289
- Mm-hmm.
- I mean,

228
00:11:36,373 --> 00:11:38,148
sure,
there'll be occasional travel,

229
00:11:38,233 --> 00:11:40,773
but most of the time,
we'll be here in L.A.

230
00:11:40,858 --> 00:11:41,989
Mm.

231
00:11:42,074 --> 00:11:43,523
Yeah. I mean, that's the hope.

232
00:11:43,608 --> 00:11:45,525
Yeah, you hope for that,
but, you know,

233
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,344
as we just found out,
these movies,

234
00:11:47,429 --> 00:11:49,431
they'll shoot 'em anywhere,
so...

235
00:11:50,803 --> 00:11:52,905
I've gone all over
the world with my families.

236
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,944
- Mm.
- I know how to help them adjust

237
00:11:55,029 --> 00:11:56,780
to constantly changing
locations.

238
00:11:56,865 --> 00:11:59,787
Starting new schools,
you know, making new friends.

239
00:12:01,924 --> 00:12:03,229
Hey.

240
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:04,975
You're home early.

241
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:09,498
What's wrong?

242
00:12:13,763 --> 00:12:15,574
So, a man named Hai Lang

243
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:19,074
- submitted a city complaint
form on the website. - Mm-hmm.

244
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:22,336
He used it as a way to get
in touch with me personally.

245
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:25,435
"My name's Hai Lang,
and I live in New Orleans.

246
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,388
"I recognized the name
William Hill from a video

247
00:12:28,473 --> 00:12:30,725
"I saw of you on the Internet.

248
00:12:31,432 --> 00:12:35,467
Not 100% certain, but I believe
I knew your mother, Laurel."

249
00:12:35,608 --> 00:12:38,225
- What?
- "We were close friends.

250
00:12:38,857 --> 00:12:42,615
I was by her side when she died
in May of 2015."

251
00:12:44,336 --> 00:12:46,595
Doesn't exactly jive
with the whole "she died

252
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,889
after I was born" story,
huh?

253
00:12:47,974 --> 00:12:49,452
- Randall, what the hell?
- I don't know.

254
00:12:49,536 --> 00:12:51,277
- I'm gonna go, um...
- Wait.

255
00:12:52,453 --> 00:12:53,779
Oh, my God.

256
00:12:54,506 --> 00:12:56,084
He sent a picture.

257
00:12:58,092 --> 00:12:59,873
Randall, is this her?

258
00:13:00,998 --> 00:13:02,709
How would I know, Beth?

259
00:13:02,794 --> 00:13:05,232
I've never seen
the woman before.

260
00:13:37,254 --> 00:13:39,675
- Hey.
- Hey.

261
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:42,425
I was thinking about bringing in
Monk's for dinner.

262
00:13:42,651 --> 00:13:44,980
Been craving
those crab legs.

263
00:13:45,438 --> 00:13:47,527
I will see you
in a bit.

264
00:13:48,206 --> 00:13:49,925
Did you really
just peck and go?

265
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,228
Uh, Randall,

266
00:13:51,313 --> 00:13:53,098
this is not
a peck and go situation.

267
00:13:53,183 --> 00:13:55,055
Okay?
We need to talk about this.

268
00:13:55,753 --> 00:13:58,145
I was wondering for 36 years.

269
00:13:58,558 --> 00:14:00,175
I got my answers.

270
00:14:00,346 --> 00:14:02,435
I'm not going down
this road.

271
00:14:03,411 --> 00:14:05,722
I understand that.
But why?

272
00:14:05,807 --> 00:14:07,245
- Beth, come on.
- Okay, Randall...

273
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:08,948
'Cause it would mean
he lied to me.

274
00:14:13,993 --> 00:14:15,738
How did you meet
my mother?

275
00:14:16,362 --> 00:14:18,761
On a bus, of all places.

276
00:14:20,167 --> 00:14:21,878
My God,
she was so beautiful.

277
00:14:22,342 --> 00:14:25,230
I got to tell you something.
One look at that face,

278
00:14:25,956 --> 00:14:28,870
and my world spun
on every axis.

279
00:14:29,682 --> 00:14:31,745
Fallen as we were
back then,

280
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:35,181
when she found out about you,
she was so excited.

281
00:14:35,823 --> 00:14:38,751
I'd never seen a woman
so determined to get clean,

282
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,185
to stay clean,

283
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:42,551
to do right by this baby.

284
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:45,780
To do right by you.

285
00:14:47,504 --> 00:14:48,766
And she did.

286
00:14:49,206 --> 00:14:50,731
For nine months.

287
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,575
But then, after the birth,

288
00:14:57,207 --> 00:15:00,051
the pain took hold of her
like a demon.

289
00:15:01,141 --> 00:15:03,270
I lost her the next day.

290
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:09,715
If, um...

291
00:15:11,223 --> 00:15:13,481
If she really did die
just a few years ago,

292
00:15:13,573 --> 00:15:15,660
it would mean
that William lied to me, Beth.

293
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,676
Think you should, um...

294
00:15:22,348 --> 00:15:24,035
call your therapist
on this one?

295
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,361
I don't need
to call my therapist.

296
00:15:25,445 --> 00:15:27,447
I need...
I need to go for a run.

297
00:15:32,805 --> 00:15:35,059
He needs to call
his therapist.

298
00:15:40,838 --> 00:15:42,840
You hated her, right?

299
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,653
Well, you know what?
Screw her

300
00:15:45,738 --> 00:15:48,437
and that glorious Range Rover
that she rode in on.

301
00:15:49,191 --> 00:15:52,629
Jet-setting all over the world
with our kids and their nannies?

302
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:56,840
That's not exactly the life
I pictured for our family.

303
00:15:57,809 --> 00:15:59,012
Well, uh, you know,

304
00:15:59,097 --> 00:16:01,990
what about private jet-setting
all over the world

305
00:16:02,075 --> 00:16:04,442
with... our kids
and their nannies?

306
00:16:07,168 --> 00:16:09,972
Okay. Look, Madison,
I am lost here.

307
00:16:10,146 --> 00:16:12,043
Uh, you know,
just a bit ago,

308
00:16:12,128 --> 00:16:14,567
you were pushing me out the door
to go to Vancouver, right?

309
00:16:14,652 --> 00:16:18,075
And now you're upset that we're
traveling for my work?

310
00:16:18,556 --> 00:16:20,582
I pushed you
to go to Vancouver

311
00:16:20,667 --> 00:16:22,520
because the babies
aren't here yet

312
00:16:22,887 --> 00:16:25,901
and because I know how much
this movie means to you.

313
00:16:25,993 --> 00:16:30,590
And you made a commitment
to a lot of people, but...

314
00:16:31,668 --> 00:16:34,347
you also made a commitment
to me and these kids.

315
00:16:36,456 --> 00:16:38,101
I didn't realize
that where we lived

316
00:16:38,186 --> 00:16:39,738
was as important
as being a family.

317
00:16:39,823 --> 00:16:42,089
And how did you think
this would work?

318
00:16:42,613 --> 00:16:45,754
Did you just
assume that me and the kids

319
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,886
would become
your international roadies?

320
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:51,535
No, I didn't...
I wouldn't say that phrase.

321
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:54,222
What... You know, I thought
we would stick together.

322
00:16:54,449 --> 00:16:55,624
Me, too.

323
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,285
In our home.

324
00:17:01,339 --> 00:17:02,863
What do you want me to do?

325
00:17:05,032 --> 00:17:07,295
What do you want me to do?
Do you want me to quit acting,

326
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:10,250
Madison?
It took me 20 years to get here.

327
00:17:12,145 --> 00:17:14,226
But I'm not exactly
in a position where I can dictate

328
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,820
where they shoot things,
okay?

329
00:17:15,905 --> 00:17:17,769
And quite frankly, I'm...

330
00:17:19,566 --> 00:17:22,019
I'm struggling
to figure out

331
00:17:22,112 --> 00:17:24,074
how this is
all of a sudden news to you.

332
00:17:27,064 --> 00:17:28,550
It's not.

333
00:17:29,702 --> 00:17:32,121
Look, I have been growing

334
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:35,036
two humans inside my body,
living with you

335
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:36,723
in this bubble.
I mean, I'm sorry

336
00:17:36,808 --> 00:17:38,088
if the realities of your career

337
00:17:38,181 --> 00:17:39,966
haven't exactly been
top of mind.

338
00:17:41,886 --> 00:17:44,441
I'm not trying
to give you a hard time, but...

339
00:17:45,683 --> 00:17:47,766
I was willing
to do this on my own.

340
00:17:48,386 --> 00:17:49,629
Remember?

341
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:52,816
I was never gonna ask you
for anything,

342
00:17:53,199 --> 00:17:54,629
but you insisted on being

343
00:17:54,714 --> 00:17:56,511
a part of our lives,
and now I have gone

344
00:17:56,596 --> 00:17:59,097
and fallen in love
with this idea of our family.

345
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:13,095
Well, I have gone
and fallen in love

346
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:15,308
with the idea
of our family, too.

347
00:18:23,691 --> 00:18:26,004
Here we are.
This is where Marc works

348
00:18:26,089 --> 00:18:27,839
according to
his Myspace page.

349
00:18:28,096 --> 00:18:30,058
This guy has a Myspace page?

350
00:18:30,879 --> 00:18:34,050
Of all the things that
you have told me about this guy,

351
00:18:34,143 --> 00:18:37,146
him having a Myspace page
is the creepiest.

352
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:44,964
Hey. You all right?

353
00:18:45,049 --> 00:18:46,722
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

354
00:18:47,249 --> 00:18:49,589
Maybe I should go in with you.

355
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:52,980
No, you don't need to go in
with me.

356
00:19:12,502 --> 00:19:13,980
Kate Pearson.

357
00:19:14,785 --> 00:19:16,488
I knew you couldn't
stay away.

358
00:19:28,344 --> 00:19:31,386
Um, Marc?

359
00:19:36,207 --> 00:19:38,981
Well, it, uh, takes
a little while to make a lady

360
00:19:39,066 --> 00:19:41,172
all of her favorite
breakfast foods for lunch.

361
00:19:41,257 --> 00:19:42,958
We got one bagel,

362
00:19:43,043 --> 00:19:45,325
which is scooped,
lightly toasted,

363
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:46,455
butter on the side.

364
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,004
And then we have

365
00:19:48,089 --> 00:19:50,035
an egg, very, very runny.

366
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,769
Which is still, to me,

367
00:19:51,854 --> 00:19:54,059
like eating an oyster
from the ass of a chicken.

368
00:19:54,144 --> 00:19:55,583
But it's the way you like it.

369
00:19:55,667 --> 00:19:56,871
I don't judge.
And then we got

370
00:19:56,956 --> 00:19:58,479
one coffee, nonfat milk.

371
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:00,285
No Sweet'N Low, though,
because I didn't have any,

372
00:20:00,369 --> 00:20:02,806
and for that,
I am very sorry.

373
00:20:03,254 --> 00:20:04,644
You remembered everything.

374
00:20:04,729 --> 00:20:06,687
Course I did.

375
00:20:09,725 --> 00:20:11,160
I really did miss you.

376
00:20:17,188 --> 00:20:19,136
You're still upset
about the cabin.

377
00:20:20,978 --> 00:20:22,598
I am so sorry, Kate.

378
00:20:22,683 --> 00:20:24,250
I was such a dick.

379
00:20:24,513 --> 00:20:27,690
I-I don't know. I-I don't know
what happens to me.

380
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,812
It's, um...

381
00:20:30,621 --> 00:20:32,370
It's like a switch
flips inside me,

382
00:20:32,544 --> 00:20:34,496
um, which...
That's so not an excuse.

383
00:20:34,581 --> 00:20:36,472
- Marc.
- And I should've apologized to you

384
00:20:36,557 --> 00:20:38,820
the second I saw you today,
but I just...

385
00:20:39,433 --> 00:20:40,857
I thought
that you showing up here

386
00:20:40,942 --> 00:20:42,552
was you saying
you forgive me.

387
00:20:42,894 --> 00:20:44,769
Well,
that's not what I'm saying.

388
00:20:44,854 --> 00:20:46,203
I mean...

389
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:48,550
I mean, that's not what
I came here to say.

390
00:20:50,951 --> 00:20:52,644
Well, what'd you come here
to say?

391
00:20:57,102 --> 00:20:58,581
Okay.

392
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:01,082
Uh-oh. This sounds heavy.

393
00:21:01,643 --> 00:21:03,043
Well, it is.

394
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,160
You're annoyed now?

395
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,847
Um...

396
00:21:17,895 --> 00:21:19,168
I'm just a little whiplashed,

397
00:21:19,253 --> 00:21:22,814
'cause I was, like,
really, really happy to see you.

398
00:21:22,899 --> 00:21:24,949
And then now
it's just like...

399
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:26,470
ugh.

400
00:21:31,293 --> 00:21:32,714
You know what,

401
00:21:33,269 --> 00:21:35,530
let's just chill and
let's just watch some TV, huh?

402
00:21:35,673 --> 00:21:37,501
Let's just, like, be here
with each other.

403
00:21:37,885 --> 00:21:39,058
Huh?

404
00:21:39,972 --> 00:21:41,316
Come on.

405
00:21:48,121 --> 00:21:49,433
Oh, wait,
that's Airplane!

406
00:21:49,629 --> 00:21:51,824
Could you
actually not change it?

407
00:21:52,026 --> 00:21:53,652
<i>We regret any inconvenience...</i>

408
00:21:53,797 --> 00:21:55,753
Um, okay.

409
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:58,129
<i>This is due to periodic</i>

410
00:21:58,214 --> 00:22:00,126
<i>air pockets we encounter.</i>

411
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,346
<i>There's no reason
to become alarmed,</i>

412
00:22:02,512 --> 00:22:05,645
<i>and we hope you enjoy
the rest of your flight.</i>

413
00:22:05,811 --> 00:22:07,813
<i>By the way,
is there anyone on board</i>

414
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,594
<i>who knows how to fly a plane?</i>

415
00:22:14,176 --> 00:22:15,395
I need a drink.

416
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:48,347
Hey, yo, I got, uh,
the DVD

417
00:22:48,432 --> 00:22:50,031
of Michel Gondry's music videos.

418
00:22:50,116 --> 00:22:51,620
Uh...

419
00:22:56,655 --> 00:22:58,073
Can I help you?

420
00:23:00,976 --> 00:23:02,495
It's Kate.

421
00:23:03,855 --> 00:23:05,509
Pearson.

422
00:23:06,698 --> 00:23:08,401
Wow.

423
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,081
Kate Pearson.

424
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:11,698
What are the odds?

425
00:23:12,098 --> 00:23:13,635
Do you live in SD?

426
00:23:15,054 --> 00:23:16,510
Vacationing?

427
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:19,183
No.

428
00:23:19,428 --> 00:23:20,846
We share a friend
on Facebook.

429
00:23:20,931 --> 00:23:22,823
I actually figured out
where you

430
00:23:23,074 --> 00:23:25,581
work because
I wanted to, uh...

431
00:23:27,502 --> 00:23:28,720
come and see you.

432
00:23:29,362 --> 00:23:30,823
Oh, okay.

433
00:23:33,576 --> 00:23:35,056
So...

434
00:23:35,332 --> 00:23:37,769
S... Um, I was
just wondering if I could...

435
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:40,393
I-I wanted to talk to you
about some things.

436
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,612
Marc!

437
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:44,354
Now.

438
00:23:45,849 --> 00:23:47,948
Hang tight. Be right back.

439
00:23:48,784 --> 00:23:50,525
Three smoke breaks in one hour?

440
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:52,176
- Really?
- I'm sorry, man.

441
00:23:52,346 --> 00:23:53,600
We've talked about this.

442
00:23:53,684 --> 00:23:55,768
If you're gonna work here,
you got to work here.

443
00:23:55,853 --> 00:23:58,116
- Yeah.
- You have five minutes.

444
00:23:59,376 --> 00:24:01,440
It's not a long-term job.

445
00:24:01,589 --> 00:24:03,417
I got this band
I've been managing

446
00:24:03,502 --> 00:24:05,808
and we're getting a residency
at this club,

447
00:24:05,893 --> 00:24:07,518
so...

448
00:24:09,783 --> 00:24:11,877
Okay, can I ask you a question?

449
00:24:13,521 --> 00:24:15,307
Okay. Sure.

450
00:24:19,511 --> 00:24:21,231
What do you remember
about our relationship?

451
00:24:21,316 --> 00:24:22,836
Like, when you look back on it,
I mean.

452
00:24:23,654 --> 00:24:25,482
Really?

453
00:24:25,734 --> 00:24:27,104
That's why you're here?

454
00:24:27,189 --> 00:24:29,931
To rehash our six-month
relationship from...

455
00:24:30,695 --> 00:24:32,471
20 years ago?

456
00:24:33,997 --> 00:24:35,390
You know what, forget it.

457
00:24:35,689 --> 00:24:37,760
Forget about it.
Goodbye, Marc.

458
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:39,877
Sorry. Uh, hold on.

459
00:24:39,969 --> 00:24:41,274
Sorry. I'm sorry.

460
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:46,534
When I look back on it,
I think...

461
00:24:48,229 --> 00:24:49,745
we were in love?

462
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,127
Um...

463
00:24:51,212 --> 00:24:53,088
I mean,
you had great taste in music.

464
00:24:53,447 --> 00:24:54,709
And...

465
00:24:55,946 --> 00:24:57,736
you were broken,
you know,

466
00:24:57,821 --> 00:24:59,432
in all the right places.

467
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:04,237
And, yeah, things got intense
at times, but, like,

468
00:25:04,486 --> 00:25:05,924
we were kids.

469
00:25:07,629 --> 00:25:09,239
No.

470
00:25:09,734 --> 00:25:10,916
I was a kid.

471
00:25:11,106 --> 00:25:13,127
You were a 24-year-old man.

472
00:25:13,622 --> 00:25:15,924
And I wasn't broken.
I was grieving.

473
00:25:16,977 --> 00:25:18,805
My dad just died.

474
00:25:19,003 --> 00:25:20,526
And I was destroyed

475
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,076
and so vulnerable
and you knew it.

476
00:25:23,946 --> 00:25:25,229
You liked it.

477
00:25:25,451 --> 00:25:26,586
- Okay...
- W... No, no, no.

478
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:27,963
I'm not finished.

479
00:25:31,516 --> 00:25:33,120
What you did to me...

480
00:25:34,853 --> 00:25:38,424
how you held my self-esteem
in your hand

481
00:25:38,721 --> 00:25:40,776
and then you decided
to crush it,

482
00:25:41,352 --> 00:25:43,659
God, that damaged me, Marc.

483
00:25:43,747 --> 00:25:45,159
For years,

484
00:25:45,684 --> 00:25:47,381
I swallowed my dreams,

485
00:25:47,466 --> 00:25:48,940
my feelings...

486
00:25:49,488 --> 00:25:51,018
and a lot of food.

487
00:25:51,502 --> 00:25:53,343
No, no, look at me.

488
00:25:53,948 --> 00:25:55,214
Look at me.

489
00:25:55,388 --> 00:25:56,760
You need to get this.

490
00:25:57,695 --> 00:26:00,959
The time that it took for me
to heal from you

491
00:26:01,044 --> 00:26:03,394
stole years of my life.

492
00:26:03,525 --> 00:26:04,956
And I can't get them
back.

493
00:26:06,661 --> 00:26:08,401
Took me a while,

494
00:26:08,645 --> 00:26:10,168
yeah, but I, um...

495
00:26:10,333 --> 00:26:12,510
I found someone who...

496
00:26:12,732 --> 00:26:15,534
loves me the way
that I deserve to be loved.

497
00:26:16,018 --> 00:26:17,815
I have a beautiful son

498
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,238
and an incredible husband,

499
00:26:20,323 --> 00:26:21,385
who's actually
in that car

500
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:23,557
and who was just, like,
seconds away

501
00:26:23,642 --> 00:26:27,752
from wanting to just pulverize
you with his bare hands.

502
00:26:29,393 --> 00:26:32,570
I'm not broken. You're the one
that's broken, Marc.

503
00:26:34,286 --> 00:26:36,135
You're the disease.

504
00:26:37,707 --> 00:26:40,815
And I'm not carrying it
a moment longer.

505
00:26:42,785 --> 00:26:44,174
So...

506
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:46,073
I give it back to you.

507
00:26:46,375 --> 00:26:47,916
Good luck with it, Marc.

508
00:26:57,619 --> 00:26:59,916
<i>Sally,
I took this man home with me,</i>

509
00:27:00,104 --> 00:27:03,082
<i>and my parents asked me,
"What cave did you pull this out of?"</i>

510
00:27:05,629 --> 00:27:06,791
Kate.

511
00:27:14,151 --> 00:27:16,143
It's gonna be fine.

512
00:27:17,121 --> 00:27:18,966
I'm gonna put this sheet
over your knees.

513
00:27:51,534 --> 00:27:55,419
Ah! God, I feel
good.

514
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,460
You know, he looked
so small to me.

515
00:27:59,736 --> 00:28:03,506
In his stupid-ass T-shirt
and just all...

516
00:28:03,634 --> 00:28:06,350
talking about his empty dreams.
It's like a joke.

517
00:28:07,928 --> 00:28:09,218
I just cannot believe
I let him

518
00:28:09,303 --> 00:28:10,397
have that much
power

519
00:28:10,481 --> 00:28:11,789
- over me.
- Hmm.

520
00:28:11,874 --> 00:28:12,965
I'm proud of you, babe.

521
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:14,741
- You did good.
- Thank you.

522
00:28:22,454 --> 00:28:25,404
I wanted to tell you
about it.

523
00:28:25,983 --> 00:28:29,585
About all of it, about Marc,
so many times,

524
00:28:29,717 --> 00:28:30,952
but...

525
00:28:32,889 --> 00:28:35,492
I didn't want you to-to
look at me like a victim.

526
00:28:35,577 --> 00:28:38,460
- Oh, Kate, come on.
- No. And today,

527
00:28:38,803 --> 00:28:41,765
you... you just
sat patiently in the car

528
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:43,999
when I know that you wanted to
rip out his jugular,

529
00:28:44,404 --> 00:28:47,581
and you let me be
my own white knight.

530
00:28:47,842 --> 00:28:51,898
And... you never looked at me

531
00:28:51,983 --> 00:28:55,046
like I was a victim...
Ever.

532
00:28:55,131 --> 00:28:57,437
And I could have just told you
everything from day one.

533
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,866
Day one
would have been a lot,

534
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,577
- but...
- Okay.

535
00:29:03,662 --> 00:29:06,070
I know.

536
00:29:06,206 --> 00:29:08,226
<i>So,
what would this mean to you</i>

537
00:29:08,311 --> 00:29:11,140
if this Hai person was
actually telling the truth?

538
00:29:11,254 --> 00:29:15,038
Beyond William's betrayal,
I mean.

539
00:29:15,522 --> 00:29:17,372
Beyond William's?

540
00:29:21,923 --> 00:29:25,387
You know, I put a...
an ad in the paper

541
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:27,910
looking for my mom
when I was 16?

542
00:29:28,077 --> 00:29:30,390
Some scam artist showed up
at the park.

543
00:29:30,564 --> 00:29:31,968
She wanted money.

544
00:29:32,827 --> 00:29:34,438
That must have hurt.

545
00:29:34,974 --> 00:29:37,538
So much so that
I stopped looking

546
00:29:37,963 --> 00:29:40,648
for another 20 years.

547
00:29:44,007 --> 00:29:48,890
She had 35 years to find me, and
she never even looked for me.

548
00:29:49,335 --> 00:29:51,022
You don't know if that's
what happened.

549
00:29:51,107 --> 00:29:52,749
I...

550
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,773
Let's look at it
this way.

551
00:29:56,199 --> 00:29:58,351
At nine years old,
you were curling your tongue

552
00:29:58,436 --> 00:30:00,743
at Black folks
in supermarkets.

553
00:30:00,857 --> 00:30:03,207
At 16, you put ads
in the paper.

554
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:06,802
And at 35,
you hired a P.I.

555
00:30:07,297 --> 00:30:08,906
Your whole life,

556
00:30:08,991 --> 00:30:11,343
your instincts have been
telling you

557
00:30:11,678 --> 00:30:13,820
you need to know
your history.

558
00:30:14,695 --> 00:30:16,702
Why do you think
you needed that?

559
00:30:18,351 --> 00:30:19,871
To know where I came from.

560
00:30:19,956 --> 00:30:22,804
To... to know who I was.

561
00:30:22,889 --> 00:30:25,116
I don't know, to...

562
00:30:26,585 --> 00:30:29,671
to feel connected or rooted

563
00:30:29,756 --> 00:30:32,077
to something
bigger than myself.

564
00:30:33,437 --> 00:30:35,398
Did knowing William
help you do that?

565
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:39,614
In a lot of ways
it did.

566
00:30:40,653 --> 00:30:44,529
Is there a chance that
knowing Laurel's story

567
00:30:44,614 --> 00:30:46,283
could help you, too?

568
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,616
You're already in
the journey, Randall.

569
00:30:48,701 --> 00:30:52,028
Why not be inin it?

570
00:30:58,802 --> 00:31:01,497
Um, I made you a little
to-go breakfast.

571
00:31:01,856 --> 00:31:03,269
This is so nice.
You didn't have to do that.

572
00:31:03,353 --> 00:31:04,528
This-this...

573
00:31:05,626 --> 00:31:07,708
Thank you. Thank you.

574
00:31:08,911 --> 00:31:12,122
You know, the car's gonna
be here... any second.

575
00:31:13,075 --> 00:31:14,538
Yeah, I just... I'm...

576
00:31:17,225 --> 00:31:19,872
I know I'm leaving
at the worst possible time.

577
00:31:21,023 --> 00:31:22,630
But when I come back,

578
00:31:23,343 --> 00:31:26,537
it will be with a heart
that is committed...

579
00:31:26,637 --> 00:31:29,856
Kevin...
I am... deeply aware

580
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:32,849
that you come from a family
of great speech-givers.

581
00:31:34,716 --> 00:31:38,185
I think you should use this time
away to be real with yourself.

582
00:31:39,209 --> 00:31:43,146
To... figure out how
this relationship and family

583
00:31:43,231 --> 00:31:46,646
is actually gonna work,
and how these babies and I

584
00:31:46,731 --> 00:31:49,528
are actually gonna fit
in your life.

585
00:31:52,708 --> 00:31:55,630
You said you were all in,
and I bought that.

586
00:31:57,925 --> 00:32:00,536
Take this moment to decide
if you really are.

587
00:32:04,382 --> 00:32:05,557
I am.

588
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:08,008
Take the moment.

589
00:32:11,609 --> 00:32:13,263
Kiss the bubbalas goodbye.

590
00:32:14,584 --> 00:32:16,060
Oh, yeah.

591
00:32:18,591 --> 00:32:20,489
Oh, man. Okay.

592
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,935
Mwah. Mwah.

593
00:32:23,281 --> 00:32:26,419
You listen to your mom,
okay, babies?

594
00:32:26,649 --> 00:32:28,513
Oh, okay.
This is hard.

595
00:32:31,944 --> 00:32:33,403
And, uh...

596
00:32:35,395 --> 00:32:36,570
Okay.

597
00:32:38,535 --> 00:32:39,810
Okay.

598
00:32:45,787 --> 00:32:47,591
Nothing went wrong.
People change.

599
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:50,989
- People change?
- Yeah. People change.

600
00:32:51,291 --> 00:32:52,575
Can they change back?

601
00:32:54,513 --> 00:32:55,521
I don't know.

602
00:32:55,637 --> 00:32:57,372
I think it's harder.

603
00:32:58,708 --> 00:33:00,544
Hey, Bug.

604
00:33:01,091 --> 00:33:03,365
- How was yourweekend?
- It was fine.

605
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:05,654
Yeah? You had a good time
with Molly?

606
00:33:05,739 --> 00:33:06,965
Mm-hmm.

607
00:33:07,139 --> 00:33:08,950
Is everything all right?

608
00:33:09,067 --> 00:33:11,170
You know, I did call
a couple times to check in.

609
00:33:11,263 --> 00:33:12,700
I didn't hear back.

610
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:17,489
Oh, sweetheart.

611
00:33:17,669 --> 00:33:19,474
Is everything okay?
What's wrong?

612
00:33:20,091 --> 00:33:21,856
I was watching
a sappy movie.

613
00:33:22,052 --> 00:33:23,466
It made me cry.

614
00:33:23,942 --> 00:33:25,521
Oh.

615
00:33:25,894 --> 00:33:27,824
I'm sorry.

616
00:33:29,848 --> 00:33:31,435
Do you want some dinner?

617
00:33:33,028 --> 00:33:34,356
I'll take some ice cream.

618
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:36,093

You really answer
the phone like that, dude?

635
00:34:25,036 --> 00:34:26,342
Randall, what's up?

636
00:34:26,427 --> 00:34:31,122
So I've been thinking
about you going to L.A.

637
00:34:31,825 --> 00:34:33,552
I don't think
you should do it.

638
00:34:33,849 --> 00:34:35,661
Right, 'cause you don't think
I'm talented.

639
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:37,300
No, no, it's not that.

640
00:34:37,764 --> 00:34:39,317
You just got married.

641
00:34:39,688 --> 00:34:41,678
Sophie's one of the best things

642
00:34:41,763 --> 00:34:43,169
that's ever happened to you,

643
00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:45,466
and this could really stress
your relationship.

644
00:34:45,872 --> 00:34:48,264
Sophie and I have been together
since we were ten, Randall.

645
00:34:48,481 --> 00:34:50,115
We can hack a few months apart.

646
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,646
Are you sure?

647
00:34:51,748 --> 00:34:53,617
You know, because
when I think of anything

648
00:34:53,702 --> 00:34:55,356
getting in between me
and Beth...

649
00:34:55,765 --> 00:34:57,747
it makes my stomach hurt.

650
00:34:59,091 --> 00:35:00,783
That's 'cause you're whipped.

651
00:35:03,895 --> 00:35:05,435
Sorry I called.

652
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,177
No, look, I, uh...

653
00:35:09,333 --> 00:35:10,935
I appreciate the concern.

654
00:35:11,058 --> 00:35:13,302
But Sophie and I are solid.

655
00:35:13,598 --> 00:35:15,208
We're gonna be okay.

656
00:35:15,352 --> 00:35:16,571
And look,
when I'm a big star,

657
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:17,924
and we're living
in some mansion,

658
00:35:18,008 --> 00:35:19,695
it'll all be worth it.

659
00:35:20,642 --> 00:35:21,957
Okay, Kev.

660
00:35:22,901 --> 00:35:24,247

Hey. Everything all right
with Mom?

666
00:36:13,327 --> 00:36:14,883
Uh, with the babies?

667
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,524
Yeah.

668
00:36:16,609 --> 00:36:19,438
Mom's good, um,
and Madison's...

669
00:36:19,725 --> 00:36:21,773
She's fine.
Yeah.

670
00:36:25,234 --> 00:36:28,514
I-I saw your, uh,
your-your strip clip

671
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:30,079
on Hoda's Twitter feed.

672
00:36:30,164 --> 00:36:32,078
- Ah...
- It's hilarious, man.

673
00:36:32,163 --> 00:36:34,274
It's good... And not, like,
in an embarrassing way at all.

674
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:35,774
I mean, it comes off
really charming.

675
00:36:35,858 --> 00:36:39,031
- It's great.
- Yeah. It's been a trip.

676
00:36:41,441 --> 00:36:44,227
Uh, h-how is everybody there?
How are the girls?

677
00:36:44,914 --> 00:36:46,227
Good. They're good.

678
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:50,914
Uh, Zoom schooling
is a unique version of hell,

679
00:36:52,023 --> 00:36:53,488
- but, um...
- I bet.

680
00:36:53,648 --> 00:36:55,476
Yeah.

681
00:37:00,739 --> 00:37:02,773
- So...
- Anyway, uh...

682
00:37:03,131 --> 00:37:05,655
Oh, no, I-I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, no, g-go ahead.

683
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:08,297
No, I wasn't, uh, n...
Go ahead.

684
00:37:08,627 --> 00:37:12,367
Well, l-look, the reason
I was calling is I'm-I'm, um...

685
00:37:13,324 --> 00:37:15,500
S... Um...

686
00:37:15,665 --> 00:37:18,414
I'm finding myself
in a really, um...

687
00:37:20,456 --> 00:37:24,648
complicated
place with Madison,

688
00:37:24,733 --> 00:37:27,445
<i>and I'm a little bit lost
on how to deal with it,</i>

689
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:30,837
<i>and I-I, uh... the first
thought that I had...</i>

690
00:37:31,992 --> 00:37:33,538
was, uh,

691
00:37:34,383 --> 00:37:38,078
well, it was
"What would Randall do?"

692
00:37:42,182 --> 00:37:44,977
<i>I, uh, I have that thought
a lot, actually.</i>

693
00:37:45,455 --> 00:37:47,070
That's a nice thing to say.

694
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:50,320
It's a...

695
00:37:51,131 --> 00:37:52,844
nice thing to know.

696
00:37:54,849 --> 00:37:56,719
I know it seems ironic, too,

697
00:37:56,804 --> 00:37:58,789
uh, because of all of the...

698
00:37:59,956 --> 00:38:02,187
horrible things
that I said to you

699
00:38:02,272 --> 00:38:03,491
that day
<i>when we were, uh...</i>

700
00:38:03,584 --> 00:38:05,774
Ah, we said a lot
of things, Kev.

701
00:38:07,133 --> 00:38:08,594
Yeah, but, uh...

702
00:38:09,289 --> 00:38:10,547
S...

703
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:19,555
Randall, Kate was telling me
about some of the things, uh,

704
00:38:20,003 --> 00:38:21,396
that you felt

705
00:38:21,481 --> 00:38:23,516

706
00:38:26,425 --> 00:38:28,078
<i>Is that really how you felt?</i>

707
00:38:33,833 --> 00:38:36,484
Yeah, Kev, it is.

708
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,937
Well, that is horrible.

709
00:38:45,172 --> 00:38:46,219
Uh...

710
00:38:47,009 --> 00:38:49,812
<i>I can't imagine having
to keep all that to yourself.</i>

711
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:01,633
Hey, Kev, I'm sorry
to cut you off,

712
00:39:01,718 --> 00:39:04,721
but, um,
now's not a great time.

713
00:39:04,834 --> 00:39:06,781

that Laurel died in May of 2015.

738
00:40:19,923 --> 00:40:21,481

Laurel?

00:41:04,932 --> 00:41:09,159
We met in our early 20s,
here in Orleans Parish.

I could see your face.
