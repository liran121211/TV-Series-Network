-True. True.

97

I should be with them.

98
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:35,100
I'm supposed to be with them.

99

Mm...

100
00:04:45,981 --> 00:04:47,722
Looks like they forgot
the special sauce.

-Oh, man!
-I know.

102
00:04:49,593 --> 00:04:51,378

Alabama,

104
00:04:53,249 --> 00:04:55,599
-and they didn't give me
the special sauce.
-Mm-hmm.

108
00:05:01,562 --> 00:05:02,780

you need to find a motel

-for the night. <i>
Oh, uh-uh.</i>

110
00:05:04,608 --> 00:05:06,958
<i>I have not done my own hair

112
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,050

If anything,
you're doing us a favor, right?

117
00:05:20,668 --> 00:05:22,626
You're giving us
a little roadside entertainment

118
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,760

and shotgunning Red Bulls

119

<i>for the next 14 hours.</i>

120
00:05:29,285 --> 00:05:31,505

122
00:05:33,463 --> 00:05:35,683

Everything is fine, I promise.

154
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:52,847

They always do.

176
00:07:38,675 --> 00:07:40,808
I am so sorry.
I should've checked your file

177
00:07:40,982 --> 00:07:42,940
-before I came in. I meant no...
-It's okay. It's okay.

178
00:07:43,114 --> 00:07:45,943
But please do remind everyone
that when the baby is here,

179
00:07:46,117 --> 00:07:48,032
she should go directly to Kate.

180
00:07:48,206 --> 00:07:49,730
Not to me.

181
00:07:49,904 --> 00:07:52,863
Will do.
Page me if you need anything.

182
00:07:53,037 --> 00:07:55,866
-Okay.
Thank you.
-Thanks.

183
00:07:56,911 --> 00:07:59,391
I mean,
it's as if she's never had

184
00:07:59,566 --> 00:08:01,350
a woman giving birth
to her one-night-stand baby

185
00:08:01,524 --> 00:08:03,134
with the adoptive mother
as the birth partner

186
00:08:03,308 --> 00:08:05,006
in the middle
of a global pandemic.

187
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,965
I know.
It's, like, old-fashioned.

188
00:08:09,706 --> 00:08:11,621
Hey.

189
00:08:11,795 --> 00:08:14,581
I'm really grateful that
you're here with me for this.

190
00:08:16,147 --> 00:08:18,585
Well, I'm really grateful
that you asked me.

191
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:20,412
Really.

192
00:08:20,587 --> 00:08:22,458
So, let's have this baby.

193
00:08:30,335 --> 00:08:32,033
I cannot wait to start a fire

194
00:08:32,207 --> 00:08:34,992
and just sit around
in my cozy socks all weekend.

195
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:36,994
Is that all
you're gonna be wearing?

196
00:08:37,168 --> 00:08:40,302
-Because I can
get on board with that.
-Ha-ha.

197
00:08:40,476 --> 00:08:42,565
You know what the best part is?

198
00:08:42,739 --> 00:08:44,741
-What's that?
-Not having to hear

199
00:08:44,915 --> 00:08:47,527
Kate recite the plot
of this week's <i>90210.</i>

200
00:08:47,701 --> 00:08:49,529
Oh, yeah. She's, uh,
kind of obsessed, huh?

201
00:08:49,703 --> 00:08:52,227
Honestly, I can't even tell
if it's a terrible show

202
00:08:52,401 --> 00:08:54,621
or if she's just terrible
at recapping it.

203
00:08:54,795 --> 00:08:56,753
And you know what else

204
00:08:56,927 --> 00:08:58,799
-I'm psyched
to not have to listen to?
-Okay.

205
00:08:58,973 --> 00:09:01,976
Kevin and Randall bickering
about everything.

206
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:05,240
I mean,
here is to an entire weekend

207
00:09:05,414 --> 00:09:08,112
-without having to hear
the word "buttmunch."
-Mm-hmm.

208
00:09:08,286 --> 00:09:11,333
Oh, babe.

209
00:09:11,507 --> 00:09:13,422
Do you feel
that bliss settling in?

210
00:09:13,596 --> 00:09:16,033
That is the bliss
of an entire weekend

211
00:09:16,207 --> 00:09:19,167
-with no surly teenage
interruptions.
-Yeah.

212
00:09:22,692 --> 00:09:24,520
Oh, no.

213
00:09:24,694 --> 00:09:27,001
-Jack, come here.
-What?

214
00:09:27,175 --> 00:09:29,481
Oh, what the hell?

215
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,837
All right,
I found 30 years' worth

216
00:09:37,011 --> 00:09:39,579
of dusty old board games
to keep us busy.

217
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:44,148
Did you put yourself
into a time-out?

218
00:09:44,322 --> 00:09:46,107
No, there's better Wi-Fi
over here.

219
00:09:46,281 --> 00:09:48,849
I-I didn't know if the kids
were trying to call or text me

220
00:09:49,023 --> 00:09:50,894
and maybe
I just didn't have service.

221
00:09:51,068 --> 00:09:53,070
Do you want to go upstairs
and watch TV instead?

222
00:09:53,244 --> 00:09:55,551
No, I don't want to watch TV.
I want my kids to call me

223
00:09:55,725 --> 00:09:57,379
with more information.
I want to teleport

224
00:09:57,553 --> 00:09:59,686
my body to Los Angeles.
I want...

225
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:02,689
I want a cocktail.

226
00:10:04,342 --> 00:10:06,562
No, I'm-I'm not kidding.
I want a cocktail.

227
00:10:06,736 --> 00:10:09,739
Are you sure? The doctor said
with the meds, you could...

228
00:10:09,913 --> 00:10:12,220
One drink every once in a while
would not kill me.

229
00:10:12,394 --> 00:10:13,917
And in this case,

230
00:10:14,091 --> 00:10:15,963
I feel like
it might actually save my life.

231
00:10:16,137 --> 00:10:18,400
Well, I mean, how would
a cocktail really compare

232
00:10:18,574 --> 00:10:20,054
A Game of Truth or Dare?

233
00:10:20,228 --> 00:10:21,621
Or your life.

234
00:10:21,795 --> 00:10:24,536
Me having a cocktail
might save your life.

235
00:10:24,711 --> 00:10:27,061
One cocktail coming right up.

236
00:10:27,235 --> 00:10:29,237
Thank you.

237
00:10:32,153 --> 00:10:34,285
Oh, come on.

238
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:36,200
<i>So, yeah. Apparently,</i>

239
00:10:36,374 --> 00:10:38,681
<i>we own a farmhouse
in New Orleans now.</i>

240
00:10:38,855 --> 00:10:40,509
Randall, that-that story

241
00:10:40,683 --> 00:10:41,902
<i>is insane.</i>

242
00:10:42,076 --> 00:10:43,555
You're not wrong.

243
00:10:45,732 --> 00:10:47,385
Okay.

244
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:51,085
Those last few have been
pretty intense.

245
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:53,087
Maybe we should call the nurse.

246
00:10:53,261 --> 00:10:55,089
You okay to keep driving
for a while?

247
00:10:55,263 --> 00:10:58,135
Mm, yeah.
It's your time to shine, baby.

248
00:10:58,309 --> 00:11:00,224
<i>Okay.</i>

249
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,587
Hey.

250
00:11:15,762 --> 00:11:17,285
You're in my spot.

251
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,638
I can see, like, ten empty spots
just in my line of vision.

252
00:11:22,812 --> 00:11:24,640
-I'm not even looking
over there.
-Great.

253
00:11:24,814 --> 00:11:26,468
Just move
into one of those, then.

254
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,514
Um... I...

255
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,081
I'm sorry, sir.

256
00:11:31,255 --> 00:11:33,736
Do you not see
my elaborate setup?

257
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:36,434
I'm loving it.
This-this elaborate setup

258
00:11:36,608 --> 00:11:38,045
kind of makes me wish

259
00:11:38,219 --> 00:11:39,350
I had gone to a football school
where I could've

260
00:11:39,524 --> 00:11:41,178
tailgated every weekend
for four years.

261
00:11:41,352 --> 00:11:43,180
-And I hate football.
-You know, I don't give

262
00:11:43,354 --> 00:11:44,442
a rat's ass. Just move it.

263
00:11:44,616 --> 00:11:46,444
Buddy, I'm just waiting

264
00:11:46,618 --> 00:11:48,316
for my daughter
to be born, okay?

265
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:52,450
And I'm waiting to find out
if my wife is gonna live or die.

266
00:11:54,017 --> 00:11:55,279
Oh.

267
00:11:57,151 --> 00:12:00,458
55 years attached at the hip.

268
00:12:00,632 --> 00:12:02,896
Now I'm down here,

269
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:05,202
and she's up there,
attached to a ventilator.

270
00:12:07,204 --> 00:12:09,685
This freakin' virus.

271
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:14,821
And I've been coming here
every night,

272
00:12:14,995 --> 00:12:18,302
and I always park in that spot.

273
00:12:18,476 --> 00:12:20,348
Number 157.

274
00:12:20,522 --> 00:12:22,698
It's her favorite number.

275
00:12:22,872 --> 00:12:24,526
It's the first house
we ever lived in.

276
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,397
157 Overhill Road.

277
00:12:26,571 --> 00:12:28,704
She's always been superstitious

278
00:12:28,878 --> 00:12:30,706
about that kind of stuff.

279
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,014
Like a special number
had some sort of a...

280
00:12:34,188 --> 00:12:36,843
a magical power.

281
00:12:37,887 --> 00:12:40,324
Am I really gonna have to ask
you to move your car again?

282
00:12:40,498 --> 00:12:43,501
No, sir, you are not.
I'm moving right now.

283
00:12:43,675 --> 00:12:45,721
I'm moving.

284
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,339
He's perfect.

285
00:12:55,513 --> 00:12:57,298
He looks just like me.

286
00:12:59,213 --> 00:13:02,042
This baby
is a mathematical anomaly.

287
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,609
He's a product
greater than the constants

288
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,786
multiplied to make him.

289
00:13:07,874 --> 00:13:09,745
I hate to break it to you,
my son,

290
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:13,880
but your father is a giant geek.

291
00:13:19,407 --> 00:13:23,063
All right,
these should be drinkable.

292
00:13:23,237 --> 00:13:24,542
-There you go.

293
00:13:24,716 --> 00:13:26,066
Thank you.

294
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,068
<i>-Salud.
-Cheers.</i>

295
00:13:30,897 --> 00:13:33,290
-Whew!
-Ah.

296
00:13:33,464 --> 00:13:34,814
I didn't have much to work with.

297
00:13:34,988 --> 00:13:36,293
That liquor cabinet
hasn't been updated

298
00:13:36,467 --> 00:13:37,773
-in 20-plus years, so I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

299
00:13:37,947 --> 00:13:38,774
I know you love anisette,
but this...

300
00:13:38,948 --> 00:13:40,950
this tastes like car fuel.

301
00:13:41,124 --> 00:13:43,083
-Car fuel? Wow.
Yeah, it does.

302
00:13:43,257 --> 00:13:45,433
Now, I seem to remember
you had more than one shot

303
00:13:45,607 --> 00:13:47,957
of chichaítos in Puerto Rico
after our wedding.

304
00:13:48,131 --> 00:13:49,437
Excuse me.
I was in Puerto Rico.

305
00:13:49,611 --> 00:13:51,395
I was married. I was happy.

306
00:13:51,569 --> 00:13:53,223
Will you please give
an old lady a break.

307
00:13:53,397 --> 00:13:56,052
-Just this once. Just this once.

308
00:14:06,976 --> 00:14:09,109
Pipe in the upstairs
bathroom burst.

309
00:14:09,283 --> 00:14:11,024
Yeah, the whole room is just...
it's flooded.

310
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:12,721
-Oh.
-I'm gonna go
to the hardware store,

311
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:14,723
get some stuff to stop all that.

312
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:16,290
What was in the boxes?

313
00:14:16,464 --> 00:14:18,292
Um, well, that's some of

314
00:14:18,466 --> 00:14:20,076
the kids' old art
we brought from home.

315
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,644
We were gonna frame it
and put it up,

316
00:14:22,818 --> 00:14:24,559
but we just never
got around to it.

317
00:14:24,733 --> 00:14:26,126
Oh, man.

318
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,215
Everything's ruined.

319
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:31,348
Come on. It's not like
our kids' crappy art

320
00:14:31,522 --> 00:14:34,569
was gonna make it
in The Met or anything.

321
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,616
Right.
That was a good one, Bec.

322
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,967
-What?
-Nothing.

323
00:14:41,141 --> 00:14:42,838
It's just, you've...

324
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,450
You've been ripping
on the kids all day.

325
00:14:46,624 --> 00:14:48,626
No, I haven't.

326
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,454
Look, forget it.
Doesn't matter.

327
00:14:50,628 --> 00:14:51,891
You're right, the box is ruined.

328
00:14:52,065 --> 00:14:53,544
-Let's just toss it and move on.
-Jack.

329
00:14:53,718 --> 00:14:54,981
I'm gonna go
to the hardware store,

330
00:14:55,155 --> 00:14:57,026
get something to fix that.

331
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,072
I'll be back soon.

332
00:15:15,044 --> 00:15:16,524
What's with you?

333
00:15:16,698 --> 00:15:18,569
Baby's on the way.

334
00:15:18,743 --> 00:15:21,746
Uh, I'd be pacing back and forth
in the waiting room if I could,

335
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,532
but don't worry, I'll-I'll stay
over here in my-my zone.

336
00:15:24,706 --> 00:15:26,490
I won't get too close.

337
00:15:28,014 --> 00:15:30,668
Uh, are those...
are those pigs on your...

338
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:36,370
Pigs are a thing with Rose,
my wife.

339
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,940
We went to Austria
on our honeymoon

340
00:15:41,114 --> 00:15:44,595
because <i>The Sound of Music
came out that year and...</i>

341
00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:46,858
she wanted to see Salzburg.

342
00:15:47,033 --> 00:15:48,860
I get it.

343
00:15:49,035 --> 00:15:50,645
I made Kate move to Pasadena

344
00:15:50,819 --> 00:15:53,213
just for the <i>
Back to the Future</i> house.

345
00:15:55,258 --> 00:15:58,087
We were there over New Year's.

346
00:15:58,261 --> 00:16:00,437
Turns out the Austrians
go all out for pigs

347
00:16:00,611 --> 00:16:01,873
over New Year's.

348
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:07,357
Pigs on platters
and marzipan pigs,

349
00:16:07,531 --> 00:16:09,969
little pig tchotchkes
in all the markets.

350
00:16:11,361 --> 00:16:13,798
They say they bring good luck.

351
00:16:14,756 --> 00:16:17,063
So...

352
00:16:17,237 --> 00:16:19,979
to start our marriage off right,

353
00:16:20,153 --> 00:16:22,459
we bought this little sucker.

354
00:16:25,462 --> 00:16:28,813
And over the years, whenever
we needed a little luck...

355
00:16:29,945 --> 00:16:31,555
You found yourself a pig.

356
00:16:34,906 --> 00:16:39,433
Figured I'd bring the whole
bacon army out for this one.

357
00:16:41,609 --> 00:16:43,132
They say they might be able

358
00:16:43,306 --> 00:16:45,265
to take her off
the ventilator soon, but...

359
00:16:45,439 --> 00:16:47,310
Hey, that's...

360
00:16:47,484 --> 00:16:50,139
you know, that's not...
that's not nothing, right?

361
00:16:50,313 --> 00:16:52,054
So you, uh...

362
00:16:52,228 --> 00:16:54,752
you haven't been able
to go inside at all, huh?

363
00:16:54,926 --> 00:16:56,189
No.

364
00:16:56,363 --> 00:16:58,713
She made me promise
not to visit.

365
00:16:58,887 --> 00:17:00,976
She didn't want me
getting sick, too.

366
00:17:02,282 --> 00:17:05,067
If you think I'm stubborn,

367
00:17:05,241 --> 00:17:06,808
you ought to meet my Rose.

368
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:11,334
Yeah.

369
00:17:11,508 --> 00:17:14,163
Kate can be
kind of stubborn, too.

370
00:17:14,337 --> 00:17:15,643
Is that why you're out here?

371
00:17:15,817 --> 00:17:16,818
She kick you out
of the delivery room?

372
00:17:16,992 --> 00:17:19,951
Oh, uh, no.

373
00:17:20,126 --> 00:17:22,693
We're actually adopting.

374
00:17:22,867 --> 00:17:25,044
Yeah, she's in there
with the birth mom,

375
00:17:25,218 --> 00:17:28,177
and there's only one
visitor allowed.

376
00:17:28,351 --> 00:17:31,485
But we made a deal--
since she gets to be in there,

377
00:17:31,659 --> 00:17:33,835
I get to pick the middle name.

378
00:17:34,009 --> 00:17:35,184
Anything I want.

379
00:17:35,358 --> 00:17:37,926
She has no veto rights.

380
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,450
-That's a lot of pressure.
-Yeah.

381
00:17:40,624 --> 00:17:43,018
Yeah, I have
quite the list going on.

382
00:17:43,192 --> 00:17:45,499
I'm having a hard time
whittling it down.

383
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,980
I don't want to pick it out
just yet.

384
00:17:49,155 --> 00:17:51,635
You know?

385
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:55,074
I want to wait till she's here,
until she's officially ours.

386
00:17:58,251 --> 00:18:00,340
Just don't want to jinx it.

387
00:18:20,751 --> 00:18:22,536
Here.

388
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:27,584
One of Rose's favorites.

389
00:18:32,241 --> 00:18:33,764
Once the anesthetic is in,

390
00:18:33,938 --> 00:18:38,029
you'll start to feel relief
in about 15 minutes.

391
00:18:38,204 --> 00:18:40,075
So, can you lean forward

392
00:18:40,249 --> 00:18:42,077
and round your shoulders,
please?

393
00:18:46,386 --> 00:18:48,562
Oh, no, no. No way.
Hell no. I am...

394
00:18:48,736 --> 00:18:50,564
-I am all the way out. No. <i>
Hey, Madison,
Madison, Madison.</i>

395
00:18:50,738 --> 00:18:52,348
<i>Don't look at the needle.
Look at me.</i>

396
00:18:52,522 --> 00:18:55,960
<i>Okay? Just focus
on these calming baby browns.</i>

397
00:18:58,876 --> 00:19:00,356
Oh, God.

398
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,228
Oh, God, I just looked
at it again, Randall.

399
00:19:02,402 --> 00:19:03,577
Distract me.

400
00:19:03,751 --> 00:19:05,100
<i>Please tell me a story that has</i>

401
00:19:05,274 --> 00:19:07,102
<i>-nothing to do with this.
-Yeah.</i>

402
00:19:07,276 --> 00:19:08,625
Okay, uh, when I decided

403
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,584
to become a city councilman,
I had to...

404
00:19:10,758 --> 00:19:12,673
-Come on, give her
something interesting.

405
00:19:14,065 --> 00:19:15,110
Okay.

406
00:19:17,112 --> 00:19:20,942
His junior prom,
Kev comes home wasted.

407
00:19:21,116 --> 00:19:22,770
Uh, reminder that I'm having

408
00:19:22,944 --> 00:19:25,642
this recovering alcoholic's
babies right now.

409
00:19:25,816 --> 00:19:27,340
<i>Yeah, but this was
back when he was just</i>

410
00:19:27,514 --> 00:19:28,950
<i>a charming rascal teen
having one too many,</i>

411
00:19:29,124 --> 00:19:30,778
<i>so just go with me here, okay?</i>

412
00:19:30,952 --> 00:19:33,128
Uh, I intercept him before
our parents know he's home.

413
00:19:33,302 --> 00:19:34,869
I take him down to his room,

414
00:19:35,043 --> 00:19:37,306
tell him to take off his shoes
so he can get into bed.

415
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,700
Go to get him a glass of water,
I come back,

416
00:19:39,874 --> 00:19:42,137
and he is completely naked,

417
00:19:42,311 --> 00:19:45,793
-belting "MMMBop"
at the top of his lungs.

418
00:19:45,967 --> 00:19:47,360
<i>I mean, my man is going for it.</i>

419
00:19:47,534 --> 00:19:49,666
<i>He's shaking
his little pasty ass,</i>

420
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,148
<i>literally jumping up and down
on his bed doing air drums.</i>

421
00:19:53,322 --> 00:19:56,020
God, Kevin. <i>
-I keep telling him</i>

422
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,328
to shut the hell up
before he wakes up our parents.

423
00:19:59,502 --> 00:20:02,331
Then, suddenly,
he stops-- right?--

424
00:20:02,505 --> 00:20:05,029
and he stares at me,
just dead serious.

425
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,641
<i>I think he's about
to hurl everywhere,</i>

426
00:20:07,815 --> 00:20:10,557
<i>and then he just says,</i>

427
00:20:10,731 --> 00:20:14,213
<i>"Dude, how come we never
started a brother band?</i>

428
00:20:14,387 --> 00:20:16,389
<i>-"Like Hanson.</i>

429
00:20:16,563 --> 00:20:18,826
<i>"We could be Pearson.</i>

430
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,481
<i>We could be rock stars, man."</i>

431
00:20:21,655 --> 00:20:23,831
A little pinch.

432
00:20:24,005 --> 00:20:25,963
<i>Hey, Madison, look at me.
Can you imagine it?</i>

433
00:20:26,137 --> 00:20:28,662

you actually made it.

Yeah, no, it's...

466
00:22:01,885 --> 00:22:03,278
You wouldn't believe
the insane night that I had.

467
00:22:03,452 --> 00:22:05,541
The head of TSA
at the Seattle airport is

468
00:22:05,715 --> 00:22:07,326
definitely going
on our Christmas card list.

469
00:22:10,807 --> 00:22:12,505
Doesn't matter.

470
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:14,202
None of that matters.

471
00:22:14,376 --> 00:22:16,596
The only thing that matters
is that I made it.

472
00:22:18,467 --> 00:22:20,164
Before I left, you asked me

473
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,079
how this family was
gonna fit into my life.

474
00:22:22,253 --> 00:22:23,994

477
00:22:29,652 --> 00:22:31,088
Yeah, no,
I don't want to take jobs

478
00:22:31,262 --> 00:22:33,482

520
00:25:14,817 --> 00:25:16,515
Hi.

521
00:25:19,474 --> 00:25:21,824
So that's what you look like.

522
00:25:27,351 --> 00:25:30,354
Kate, do you...
do you mind if...

523
00:25:32,008 --> 00:25:34,358
I would just like
to be alone with her.

524
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,796
Oh, um...

525
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:38,798
yeah.

526
00:25:38,972 --> 00:25:40,016
Of course.

527
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:42,062
♪ <i>I feel it, too</i>♪

528
00:25:42,236 --> 00:25:45,282
♪ <i>Take me with you,
take me with you.♪</i>

529
00:25:54,814 --> 00:25:56,642
G-7?

530
00:25:56,816 --> 00:25:59,035
The twins are good.

531
00:25:59,209 --> 00:26:02,169
Still just the one picture,
and no new update from Kate.

532
00:26:02,343 --> 00:26:04,040
Well, I'm sure
we'll hear something

533
00:26:04,214 --> 00:26:06,216
-when there's something to hear.
-Yeah.

534
00:26:09,742 --> 00:26:11,221
What is that?

535
00:26:11,395 --> 00:26:13,397
-Hmm?
-The blobs.

536
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,356
The-the painting. You've been
staring at that all night.

537
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:17,793
What is that?

538
00:26:21,275 --> 00:26:23,103
What's all this?

539
00:26:23,277 --> 00:26:25,279
This is the best
possible solution

540
00:26:25,453 --> 00:26:27,455
I could find
to try and save them.

541
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:29,544
I'm gonna go get my hair dryer.

542
00:26:29,718 --> 00:26:31,372
No, Bec.

543
00:26:31,546 --> 00:26:33,330
It's fine. They-they're ruined.

544
00:26:33,504 --> 00:26:35,550
Really, I'm-I'm over it.

545
00:26:37,683 --> 00:26:39,554
Jack...

546
00:26:39,728 --> 00:26:42,644
making fun of our kids together
is our thing.

547
00:26:42,818 --> 00:26:45,038
It's our one coping mechanism

548
00:26:45,212 --> 00:26:46,909
against three sets
of teenage hormones.

549
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:48,345
Yeah, I know. You're right.

550
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:50,913
So, what is the deal?

551
00:26:54,787 --> 00:26:57,398
They don't want to hang out
with us anymore.

552
00:26:58,573 --> 00:27:03,099
It's-it's...
it's moving really fast.

553
00:27:03,273 --> 00:27:05,754
You know, they-they like us
one moment, and then the next...

554
00:27:05,928 --> 00:27:08,061
They're teenagers.

555
00:27:08,235 --> 00:27:09,758
It's perfectly normal
that they want to

556
00:27:09,932 --> 00:27:11,717
hang out with
other teenagers over us.

557
00:27:11,891 --> 00:27:14,197
I know, but we only have

558
00:27:14,371 --> 00:27:17,070
a few more years together
under the same roof.

559
00:27:17,244 --> 00:27:20,116
Okay, a few more years
where we get to be a part

560
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:23,032
of their daily lives.

561
00:27:23,206 --> 00:27:25,078
And then what?

562
00:27:25,252 --> 00:27:26,514
They're gonna move out.

563
00:27:26,688 --> 00:27:27,994
And forget vacations
to the cabin.

564
00:27:28,168 --> 00:27:31,519
Babe, w-we're gonna
be lucky if they call us

565
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:34,783
once a week just to let us know
what's going on in their lives.

566
00:27:34,957 --> 00:27:37,656
Babe, it is not
gonna be like that.

567
00:27:38,918 --> 00:27:40,441
It was like that for us.

568
00:27:40,615 --> 00:27:42,312
We moved out
of our parents' houses,

569
00:27:42,486 --> 00:27:44,271
and we never looked back.

570
00:27:44,445 --> 00:27:46,229
Okay.

571
00:27:46,403 --> 00:27:49,755
You being moody I can handle,
but comparing us to our parents,

572
00:27:49,929 --> 00:27:51,713
that is a bridge too far,
mister.

573
00:27:53,628 --> 00:27:58,198
Jack, our family is not
ending anytime soon.

574
00:27:58,372 --> 00:28:00,591
Come here. Come here.

575
00:28:03,246 --> 00:28:04,334
Look at this picture.

576
00:28:04,508 --> 00:28:06,293
Do you see how the colors

577
00:28:06,467 --> 00:28:08,469
from their little handprints
have... have soaked

578
00:28:08,643 --> 00:28:10,297
all the way down to ours?

579
00:28:11,646 --> 00:28:14,475
We're all still there together.

580
00:28:14,649 --> 00:28:18,784
We are, even if it doesn't look
the way that it used to.

581
00:28:20,263 --> 00:28:22,831
And even when we are old fogeys

582
00:28:23,005 --> 00:28:24,615
living out here
in the woods one day

583
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:28,881
like witches from
some children's fairy tale,

584
00:28:29,055 --> 00:28:32,406
we're still gonna
be close to them.

585
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,321
Didn't realize we were
gonna be witches.

586
00:28:34,495 --> 00:28:36,932
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm gonna
let myself really go.

587
00:28:37,106 --> 00:28:38,586
Oh, okay.

588
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,457
We will never miss a thing.

589
00:28:40,631 --> 00:28:42,764
Not the little stuff,

590
00:28:42,938 --> 00:28:45,158
and especially not
the big stuff.

591
00:28:47,508 --> 00:28:48,814
Mm.

592
00:28:52,861 --> 00:28:55,037
So we framed it,

593
00:28:55,211 --> 00:28:59,346
as a... reminder

594
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,435
to always be close,

595
00:29:01,609 --> 00:29:03,916
never miss a thing.

596
00:29:05,134 --> 00:29:09,356
I know it's silly,
but I feel like...

597
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:11,314
like I'm letting down Jack

598
00:29:11,488 --> 00:29:14,361
by not being there
for them today.

599
00:29:14,535 --> 00:29:17,146
Like I'm-I'm not holding up
my end of the promise.

600
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,018
-Rebecca, you...
-No, it-it's okay.

601
00:29:19,192 --> 00:29:21,498
You don't have to
make me feel better.

602
00:29:23,892 --> 00:29:26,242
We never talk about this.

603
00:29:28,201 --> 00:29:30,377
How you...

604
00:29:30,551 --> 00:29:33,641
have to bear
Jack's death differently.

605
00:29:33,815 --> 00:29:35,774
For yourself...

606
00:29:35,948 --> 00:29:38,341
and for me.

607
00:29:38,515 --> 00:29:40,126
And our marriage.

608
00:29:44,652 --> 00:29:46,306
Thank you.

609
00:29:48,612 --> 00:29:50,876
I know it's a lot.

610
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:52,529
I know I'm a lot.

611
00:29:52,703 --> 00:29:54,836
Hey.

612
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,102
You're just the right amount.

613
00:30:12,027 --> 00:30:13,812
Hi, little one.

614
00:30:18,294 --> 00:30:20,079
So you're the reason
I've been skipping cold cuts

615
00:30:20,253 --> 00:30:22,255
for the last nine months, huh?

616
00:30:24,561 --> 00:30:26,912
You should know
that I live and die

617
00:30:27,086 --> 00:30:30,393
by pastrami on rye, so...

618
00:30:30,567 --> 00:30:32,787
this hasn't been easy for me.

619
00:30:35,964 --> 00:30:38,314
But...

620
00:30:38,488 --> 00:30:43,102
from the minute that I knew
that you were real

621
00:30:43,276 --> 00:30:45,452
and I was really having you...

622
00:30:47,454 --> 00:30:50,239
...I knew that I needed
to take care of you.

623
00:30:55,418 --> 00:30:58,769
Even if you were never
meant to be mine.

624
00:30:58,944 --> 00:31:00,641
Giving you to Toby and Kate is

625
00:31:00,815 --> 00:31:02,512
the hardest thing
I have ever done.

626
00:31:05,124 --> 00:31:07,822
But it might just be
the best thing I'll ever do.

627
00:31:10,303 --> 00:31:14,046
So I have to say goodbye
to you now,

628
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,526
because there is
someone really special

629
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,877
waiting to say hello.

630
00:31:27,624 --> 00:31:29,452
Hi.

631
00:31:29,626 --> 00:31:30,976
Thank you.

632
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:33,369
Hi, sweet girl.

633
00:31:33,543 --> 00:31:36,372
Hi. It's so nice to meet you.

634
00:31:36,546 --> 00:31:38,287
Oh, my goodness.

635
00:31:38,461 --> 00:31:39,941
Hi.

636
00:31:42,204 --> 00:31:44,206
I'm your mom.

637
00:31:54,695 --> 00:31:57,698
I feel like I have waited
my whole life to meet you.

638
00:32:00,701 --> 00:32:02,877
I can't wait
to watch you grow up.

639
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,534
To French-braid your hair.

640
00:32:07,708 --> 00:32:10,319
And to make
Play-Doh castles together.

641
00:32:12,321 --> 00:32:14,367
And I got to be honest with you.

642
00:32:16,195 --> 00:32:17,979
The world is...
it's a little nutty out there

643
00:32:18,153 --> 00:32:21,026
right now, but...

644
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,638
no matter what, no matter what,

645
00:32:27,597 --> 00:32:30,687
You will never, ever...

646
00:32:30,861 --> 00:32:32,907
doubt your place in it.

647
00:32:35,301 --> 00:32:38,869
And I'm really excited for you
to meet your dad.

648
00:32:39,044 --> 00:32:41,046
Do you want to meet your dad?

649
00:32:48,531 --> 00:32:50,403
Hey.

650
00:32:50,577 --> 00:32:52,100
Do we have a baby?

651
00:32:52,274 --> 00:32:53,580
<i>We do.</i>

652
00:32:53,754 --> 00:32:55,582
<i>Meet your daughter Hailey.</i>

653
00:33:00,891 --> 00:33:03,416
Hi there, Hailey Rose.

654
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,506
Hailey Rose Damon.
I love it.

655
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,290
Aw.

656
00:33:08,464 --> 00:33:11,076
<i>Wait, after Rose Tico
fromStar Wars, right?</i>

657
00:33:12,251 --> 00:33:14,079
Uh...

658
00:33:14,253 --> 00:33:15,906
yeah, something like that.

659
00:33:17,473 --> 00:33:20,389
Oh, my goodness,
look at all that hair.

660
00:33:20,563 --> 00:33:22,261
What I wouldn't give.

661
00:33:22,435 --> 00:33:24,524
She's like Fabio in his prime.

662
00:33:24,698 --> 00:33:26,830
I know.

663
00:33:34,838 --> 00:33:36,492
Oh, it's Kev.

664
00:33:37,972 --> 00:33:39,713
Well,

665
00:33:39,887 --> 00:33:42,933
<i>how does it feel to be the Pearson family's newest dad?</i>

666
00:33:44,631 --> 00:33:46,633
Yeah. Man, I can't believe
I'm a dad, dude.

667
00:33:47,895 --> 00:33:49,288
Congrats, Papa Bear.

668
00:33:49,462 --> 00:33:50,941
-Beth says... <i>
-I heard.</i>

669
00:33:51,116 --> 00:33:53,292
Yeah, no, I heard.
Thank you. Thank you very much.

670
00:33:53,466 --> 00:33:54,945
Uh, you got names?

671
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,599
<i>Names? Yes.</i>

672
00:33:56,773 --> 00:33:59,515
Uh, Nicholas and Frances.

673
00:33:59,689 --> 00:34:01,735
Nicholas.

674
00:34:01,909 --> 00:34:05,304
Oh, man, Uncle Nicky
will be through the roof.

675
00:34:05,478 --> 00:34:07,480
And, uh, Frances?

676
00:34:07,654 --> 00:34:09,656
-Frances?
-That's... unique.

677
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:11,527
<i>I know, I know.</i>

678
00:34:11,701 --> 00:34:13,834
Um, named after
Madison's grandmother.

679
00:34:14,008 --> 00:34:16,663
Um, she gave me Nicky,
so we'll-we'll call her Franny.

680
00:34:16,837 --> 00:34:18,143
Right on. Franny's cute.

681
00:34:18,317 --> 00:34:19,666
<i>Franny is definitely cute.</i>

682
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,495
<i>-Yeah, yeah.</i>

683
00:34:26,412 --> 00:34:28,196
Man, eight hours ago,
I was dragging some guy

684
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:32,418
out of his totaled SUV,
and now here I am a dad.

685
00:34:32,592 --> 00:34:33,636
To twins.

686
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:35,029
<i>Damn.</i>

687
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:38,946
Yesterday, I was in New Orleans

688
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:42,341
communing with the spirit
of my birth mom.

689
00:34:42,515 --> 00:34:44,647
Now I own her house.

690
00:34:44,821 --> 00:34:46,475
Damn.

691
00:34:46,649 --> 00:34:48,303
Yeah.

692
00:34:52,829 --> 00:34:54,831
We got a lot to catch up on.

693
00:34:56,572 --> 00:34:58,400
Yeah.

694
00:35:01,969 --> 00:35:04,580
Randall, I was terrified
when I was on that plane.

695
00:35:06,147 --> 00:35:08,541
I was terrified that
I wouldn't make it in time,

696
00:35:08,715 --> 00:35:10,456
and I was terrified that
she would be alone,

697
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:13,285
and when I walked in that room,
man, I heard your voice,

698
00:35:13,459 --> 00:35:15,939
<i>and I, um...</i>

699
00:35:18,681 --> 00:35:20,553
Thank you. Thank you.

700
00:35:22,642 --> 00:35:24,426
<i>After everything that
we've been through recently,</i>

701
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,862
<i>you're still...</i>

702
00:35:26,036 --> 00:35:27,908
You're my brother.

703
00:35:30,606 --> 00:35:32,217
Yeah.

704
00:35:34,436 --> 00:35:37,222
I did say some... some pretty
horrible things to you, Randall,

705
00:35:37,396 --> 00:35:39,441
and the truth is you are...

706
00:35:43,489 --> 00:35:45,926
You're the best person I know.

707
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,102
<i>And on my finest day,</i>

708
00:35:48,276 --> 00:35:52,280
<i>I am simply doing a poor man's imitation of you.</i>

709
00:35:52,454 --> 00:35:54,239
Hey, man.

710
00:35:54,413 --> 00:35:56,415
We both said things.

711
00:35:56,589 --> 00:35:58,721
Tensions were high.

712
00:36:02,769 --> 00:36:05,598
We got a lot of ground to cover.

713
00:36:05,772 --> 00:36:08,078
Lot of things I didn't...

714
00:36:08,253 --> 00:36:09,776
see growing up.

715
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:11,604
<i>Hey, man.</i>

716
00:36:11,778 --> 00:36:14,302
If you really want to have
that conversation with me,

717
00:36:14,476 --> 00:36:17,349
then I cannot wait
to have it with you.

718
00:36:17,523 --> 00:36:19,873
And one day, when you don't have

719
00:36:20,047 --> 00:36:23,311
two brand-spanking-new babies
and just went through a whole

720
00:36:23,485 --> 00:36:26,662
Planes, Trains and Automobiles <i>
adventure to get to,</i>

721
00:36:26,836 --> 00:36:28,882
we will have it.

722
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:30,666
I promise you that.

723
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,668
But now is not the time.

724
00:36:32,842 --> 00:36:36,585
<i>Now is the time to celebrate
your new family.</i>

725
00:36:36,759 --> 00:36:38,326
Yes.

726
00:36:39,675 --> 00:36:42,374
I can't believe you told her the "MMMBop" story.

727
00:36:57,606 --> 00:36:59,217
Hi.

728
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,828
Hi.

729
00:37:02,916 --> 00:37:04,570
What time does your watch say?

730
00:37:04,744 --> 00:37:06,311
Um...

731
00:37:06,485 --> 00:37:08,182
-9:53.
-Mm.

732
00:37:08,356 --> 00:37:11,359
9:53. That's good.

733
00:37:11,533 --> 00:37:14,493
I was worried maybe all the
clocks in the house were fast.

734
00:37:14,667 --> 00:37:16,408
I didn't want to accuse you
of being

735
00:37:16,582 --> 00:37:21,195
three hours and 53 minutes late
for no reason.

736
00:37:21,369 --> 00:37:23,545
-Look, Es, I...
-One night.

737
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:26,505
I asked you for one night
to come home at 6:00

738
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:29,377
to have dinner with your son.

739
00:37:29,551 --> 00:37:32,162
He was so excited for you
to eat the pizza he made you.

740
00:37:32,337 --> 00:37:33,729
I wanted to make it home.

741
00:37:33,903 --> 00:37:35,514
What could you be doing
in that office

742
00:37:35,688 --> 00:37:37,646
that is so much
more important than us?

743
00:37:39,735 --> 00:37:42,303
I'm so close
to something huge, Es.

744
00:37:42,477 --> 00:37:44,566
No one has created
an efficient algorithm

745
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:47,047
to compute
the Karhunen-Loève transform.

746
00:37:47,221 --> 00:37:48,875
So I had the idea
to approach the problem

747
00:37:49,049 --> 00:37:50,572
by studying a cosine transform,

748
00:37:50,746 --> 00:37:52,226
-and then...
-No, stop.

749
00:37:56,535 --> 00:37:59,320
If I am going to forgive you,

750
00:37:59,494 --> 00:38:01,453
then I need to understand why

751
00:38:01,627 --> 00:38:04,238
what you are doing matters
so much to you.

752
00:38:05,761 --> 00:38:09,199
So explain it to me
so I will understand.

753
00:38:09,374 --> 00:38:11,898
Explain it to me like I'm...

754
00:38:12,072 --> 00:38:15,075
like I'm our four-year-old son.

755
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,818
All right, well,

756
00:38:18,992 --> 00:38:22,256
you want to move on
to something else?

757
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:25,215
No, it's-it's late.
I think I'm all gamed out.

758
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:27,000
-Okay.

759
00:38:31,918 --> 00:38:34,616
Oh, God, it's Kate.

760
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:37,663
When your mother wants a picture
of Mike, what do we do?

761
00:38:37,837 --> 00:38:39,578
We mail it to her.

762
00:38:39,752 --> 00:38:41,319
Right. We mail it to Argentina.

763
00:38:41,493 --> 00:38:43,364
She gets it a few weeks later.

764
00:38:43,538 --> 00:38:46,106
What if, instead of waiting
for the mail,

765
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:50,937
she could see the photo
on a computer almost instantly?

766
00:38:51,111 --> 00:38:53,461
What do you mean?

767
00:38:53,635 --> 00:38:55,507
The military has created
a network of computers

768
00:38:55,681 --> 00:38:57,770
around the world
that are all connected.

769
00:38:57,944 --> 00:39:01,034
Soon, common people
will have them,

770
00:39:01,208 --> 00:39:05,821
and if my team can optimize
a form of data compression,

771
00:39:05,995 --> 00:39:08,041
they'll be able to share images.

772
00:39:09,259 --> 00:39:12,132
So, you put a picture
on a computer,

773
00:39:12,306 --> 00:39:15,570
and my mother across the world
sees the same picture?

774
00:39:15,744 --> 00:39:19,095
Yes, and imagine if one day
it wasn't just a picture.

775
00:39:19,269 --> 00:39:20,967
Imagine it was a movie.

776
00:39:21,141 --> 00:39:24,884
Imagine you could talk
to someone on a screen,

777
00:39:25,058 --> 00:39:29,454
like a phone call
but with video.

778
00:39:32,065 --> 00:39:33,327
-Hi. Hi, sweetheart.
-Hi, Kate.

779
00:39:33,501 --> 00:39:35,111

-Hi.</i>

780
00:39:35,285 --> 00:39:36,983

00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,770
