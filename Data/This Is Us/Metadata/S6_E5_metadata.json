He decides to invite Cassidy in wanting some company, which brings into light the nature of Kevin's life with women and the balance between friendship and what at the time is often monogamous sex in his want for a committed relationship. Malik will be in Philadelphia for twenty-four hours, he wanting to make dinner for Randall, Beth and the family. Randall and Beth know that the dinner is meant for an announcement of some sort, they going through their usual game of guessing the options of the worse in the hope that nothing can be as bad as they can think of. They will soon find out how \"bad\" it is as the dinner nears its conclusion. And Rebecca is spending the day with Kate and the children as Kate invites her mother to class with her. Kate knows that it's been a rocky forty year road for the two of them to a point of a now truly loving relationship - one of the low points being when Rebecca started dating again after Jack's passing - which makes the pronouncement she has to make to her mother all the more difficult.\u2014Huggo"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "16296824", "rating": 8.2, "votes": 1195, "number_of_episodes": 106}
