The first is D\u00e9j\u00e0's, who is taking the bus to visit Malik in Boston for the first time since he went away to Harvard, but she told Randall and Beth that she is spending the weekend studying with a girlfriend in town. While she has a sense of anticipation for seeing Malik again, she gets a dose of reality when she sees Malik's student/co-parenting life without her, especially when she meets Jennifer for the first time. The second is Nicky's, who, accompanied by Rebecca and Miguel, is driving two hours to reconnect with Sally Brooks without invitation, with whom he had a fleeting relationship in his youth as she was on her way to Woodstock and whom he's pined after for fifty years. Something Nicky admits en route colors the meeting, which ends up being one of the most awkward encounters any of them ever experience while at the same time illuminating for their current stage in life.\u2014Huggo"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "16433208", "rating": 8.2, "votes": 1327, "number_of_episodes": 106}
