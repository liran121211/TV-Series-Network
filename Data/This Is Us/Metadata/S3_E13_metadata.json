In addition to providing her care during her recuperation, they want to speak to her about either working on a part-time basis or preferably retiring altogether from her longtime job as a high school principal. Zoe knows that she has to be the stronger one in the situation as Beth has never been able to stand up to her strong-willed mother. The issue of Carol's retirement ends up taking a back seat to something that Zoe learned on the drive to DC and which Beth finally admits to her mother: that she was laid off and has been unemployed now for several months. This issue brings Beth back to her growing up and having her dreams of being a prima ballerina dashed, partly out of the family's circumstance and partly out of being good but not quite good enough - or so Carol thought - despite she putting every ounce of effort she could muster into pursuing this dream.\u2014Huggo"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "6439910", "rating": 8.6, "votes": 1810, "number_of_episodes": 106}
