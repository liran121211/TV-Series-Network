Meanwhile, Jack and Rebecca deal with the fallout of their big fight.", "In the mid 1990s, Rebecca has asked Jack to move out temporarily to live with Miguel as she believes he is part of the problem of not feeling fulfilled, his fight with Ben and his resulting words which show that he does not fully support her career. Beyond dealing with the issues between the two of them, Jack and Rebecca have to deal with telling the kids, who, in turn, have their own feelings about the situation, Kevin's which has more to do about Randall. In current day, the Big 3 are celebrating their thirty-seventh birthdays. Randall, following William's death, wants to honor both his fathers by adopting a child. What he thought was Beth's support in the matter is not quite what he initially believed, Beth who turns to old comforts to look for answers to Randall's needs in the matter with which they can both live. Kevin, Sophie, Kate and Toby are planning a double date birthday celebration in Los Angeles, where Kate now lives, where Kevin is filming a movie directed by Ron Howard and to where Sophie is planning on flying specifically for the birthday. That birthday celebration isn't quite as each of the four anticipates based on what happens this day, including Kate's plan to go on her first singing audition on Toby's urging, and incidents between Kate, Toby and Kevin coming out of that audition.\u2014Huggo"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "6439846", "rating": 8.7, "votes": 2979, "number_of_episodes": 106}
