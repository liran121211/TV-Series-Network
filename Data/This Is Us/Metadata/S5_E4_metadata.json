The source of that insecurity is shown in two previous time periods, when he was an infant as he would not stop crying when Rebecca could not, against Jack's wishes stemming from advice from Miguel and Shelley, let him cry himself to sleep instead of running to his crib side, and when he was named quarterback for the school's football team at age 13, he wanting to give up when the going got even a little tough.
