On top of it all, Rebecca has been doing all the heavy lifting keeping peace in the family, while Jack has been the best dad whenever he has been around, which is not very often, and becoming less and less so on his own initiative in not wanting to deal with the problems while he drowns his sorrows at a bar with Miguel. The question becomes if their family can withstand all these stresses on it. Meanwhile, Kevin discovers that leaving \"Man-ny\" is not as easy as just saying that he is quitting the show, as he has a binding two year contract. He is forced to attend a Hollywood party to ask the network bigwigs for forgiveness, something, because of his utter contempt for the show, he isn't sure he can do despite the consequences on his lucrative career. He wants Kate to go to the party with him for support, something she is resisting if only because of feeling self-conscious at a function where all the gorgeous people will be in attendance, while Toby wants her to go and take him with her so as not to make their relationship all about the common issue that brought them together, namely their weight problems. And Randall has welcomed William to his home so that he can help William get some proper health care for his advanced stomach cancer.
