Almost immediately upon their arrival, Hai drops some big news on them before he settles into Laurel's story, which is to the best of his knowledge because much of it is second hand from what Laurel told him. While Hai tells them the unabridged version about her growing up, the strain she had with her banker father, how the two of them met and fell in love, and how she made it to Pittsburgh where she met William, Randall wants to skip to an explanation the difference between William's reality of believing her to have died right after Randall's birth and Hai's story of Laurel having only recently passed. After getting the basic outline of his mother's entire life story, Randall feels the need both to connect with her and by association release the lifelong pain he has been carrying with him.\u2014Huggo"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "13440628", "rating": 8.9, "votes": 2240, "number_of_episodes": 106}
