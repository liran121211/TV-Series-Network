Most of that focus is on Rebecca, whose Alzheimer's is progressively worse, more noticeable for someone like Randall who has not seen her of late in his new senate life. Rebecca is scheduled to perform a song important to both her and Kate at the reception, but no one is sure if Rebecca will be able to do it despite Kate and Philip and by association everyone in the family doing whatever they can to ensure that Rebecca's day is as routinized as possible, something she bucked when the Big Three were six to what she at the time considered disastrous results. As the day goes on, someone else in the family notices someone else whose overall health may also become an issue for the family as a whole. The other focus, at least for Beth and Madison, is Kevin, as they stumble across some evidence that Kevin was not alone in bed last night. Their sleuthing leads to three possible candidates: Arielle, the wedding singer, who they saw being friendly with Kevin the day before; Cassidy, Kevin's plus one at the wedding, their relationship which they have previously stated has long been purely platonic; and Sophie, despite the fact that she is remarried to someone else.\u2014Huggo"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "19064708", "rating": 8.8, "votes": 1566, "number_of_episodes": 106}
