Being at the cabin also allows him to see the progress of the house construction being overseen by Cassidy and Nicky, with Matty and Edie also there. While he is in the process of learning how to play the guitar, another of those grand goals he is doing very badly, he can't help but reflect on other past goals and their failure, such as when he was six and wanted to dive off the diving board at the deep end of the pool and touch the drain at the bottom like the bigger kids even before he knew how to swim. But the events of others at the cabin gives him a broader perspective of how he believes he should fit into the lives of others for whom he truly cares.\u2014Huggo"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "18267002", "rating": 7.8, "votes": 1222, "number_of_episodes": 106}
