On Madison's suggestion, she, Kevin, Kate, Toby, and Jack rent a trailer and drive to the cabin where Rebecca and Miguel have been living since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic for the milestone. With the trial in St. Louis placed on hold due to the pandemic, Rebecca has thrived at the cabin with a system that she and Miguel have to deal with any of her possible memory lapses if/when they occur if she is without him. The one person not joining this celebration is Randall who has not talked meaningfully to Kevin since their fallout earlier in the year. As such Randall plans on celebrating his fortieth birthday quietly at home with his family. The day also marks D\u00e9j\u00e0 and Malik's first date first anniversary. With the birthday milestone, flashbacks are shown of the immediate lead ups to the Big Three's own births, including of Randall's biological mother, Laurel, who is only a footnote in his life. Also presented are the discussions of future Pearsons, including Kevin and Madison deciding to raise their twins together and Kate and Toby anxiously awaiting any news about their adoption application.\u2014Huggo", "The Big Three's 40th birthday is fast approaching and everyone heads to the cabin for the milestone, except Randall who hasn't talked to Kevin since their fallout; Flashbacks show the immediate lead ups to the Big Three's births and Randall's biological mother."], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "10322342", "rating": 7.5, "votes": 2139, "number_of_episodes": 106}
