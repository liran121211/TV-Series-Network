Jack is estranged from his widowed father, who knows nothing about Jack's current life. By the end of Rebecca's first trimester by which time they've prepared somewhat for their new life as parents including renting a two bedroom sixth floor walk-up apartment they can ill afford, they learn that Rebecca is carrying triplets. Knowing that the apartment is impractical for three babies and not having the financial means for three children at this time, each of Jack and Rebecca make decisions about their life as parents for which they may not be emotionally prepared, but which they know they have to do to make it under the circumstances.

After Kevin decides what to do about the dilemma, one statement that he makes to Olivia may define what ultimately happens.
