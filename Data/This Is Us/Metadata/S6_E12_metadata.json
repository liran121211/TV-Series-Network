Within those bookends, the specifics that define the path are what Kate considers the final straw in their relationship's disintegration while they still love each other, what Toby truly does see as being the problem of their marriage or what he wants to think it is, and how Kate and Philip are brought together, especially in light of Kate's assertion that Philip is a womanizer who only dated pencil-thin women before her. What may truly define Kate and Toby's relationship, however, is something that she says to him after their divorce papers are signed, something that he in turn does not believe nor ever would, or so he thinks.\u2014Huggo"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "19064704", "rating": 8.6, "votes": 1531, "number_of_episodes": 106}
