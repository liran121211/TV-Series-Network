Kate and Toby face unexpected issues. A run-in with someone from his past gives Kevin pause.", "The current state of Beth, Kevin, Kate, and Toby's professional lives are presented as they go through or settle into a transition. With the pandemic and doing things via Zoom not working, Beth is forced to close the doors to the dance studio, the second major blow in her dance career while reflecting the end of her life as an aspiring ballerina. She has to decide what her next move will be, whether that be going back to her old life in urban planning or something else. After going to a private screening solely with Foster of the now completed movie, Kevin is reminded that walking out on him is only the latest in a series of his high profile \"walk outs,\" which may negatively affect his career unless this film is a commercial and critical success. He unexpectedly runs into someone from his past as he and his team plot his next move. For the first time in her life, Kate by teaching music seems to have found her professional footing. In what has been their less than smooth lifelong mother/daughter relationship, Rebecca can provide some insight into Kate's current career. Kate's professional happiness is something that she feels she can't share with Toby while he is unhappy being househusband/father after losing his job. Wanting to feel useful and cognizant of their cash flow, Toby is determined to fix a leaking water pipe in the house despite not having the inherent skills to do so. Needing to call in some reinforcements, Toby gets another point of view of unemployment from someone who was also the proverbial breadwinner in his household. Meanwhile, Madison is nervous about having Rebecca along on her and Kate's wedding dress shopping outing because she gets along with her best friend's mother but is unsure how she is received by her fianc\u00e9's mother.\u2014Huggo"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "14451164", "rating": 8.1, "votes": 1198, "number_of_episodes": 106}
