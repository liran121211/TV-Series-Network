In the lead up to Thanksgiving, Randall feels he has finally made some sort of connection with D\u00e9j\u00e0, he helping her with a science project for school, about which she seems excited. That life with D\u00e9j\u00e0 may quickly come to an end when Randall and Beth learn, in somewhat of a hard way, that D\u00e9j\u00e0's mother, Shauna, has been released from prison. Due to the means through which they find out about Shauna, Randall and Beth believe that Shauna is not fit to regain custody of her daughter, they who vow to fight for what they think is best for D\u00e9j\u00e0, which is to stay with them. What ends up factoring into Randall's thoughts about D\u00e9j\u00e0 is the approaching one-year anniversary of he finding about about his mother knowing William's whereabouts his entire life, his subsequent discussion with William about the nature of the relationship between him and Rebecca over those years, and Randall's own life with his Caucasian parents, especially when he was contemplating an alternative to the outward decision to attend Harvard or another Ivy League school in the approach to graduating from high school.\u2014Huggo"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "6439864", "rating": 8.8, "votes": 2698, "number_of_episodes": 106}
