Departing the cabin for home, Kate realizes that she and Toby need some time together alone for them to rediscover what has obviously been missing from their marriage of late, which has only been exacerbated by the physical distance, hence Kate's suggestion that she spend a weekend in San Francisco with him and without the kids. As Kate spends the weekend with Toby in its ebbs and flows of emotions, they are, without Toby's knowledge, in the presence of a third which makes the weekend more difficult, namely the spirit of the \"old\" Toby who can't help but comment on the proceedings.\u2014Huggo"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "18547072", "rating": 8.0, "votes": 1242, "number_of_episodes": 106}
