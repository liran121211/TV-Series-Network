She has planned a weekend getaway for herself, Toby, and Jack to a resort for families with children with blindness, something that she not only believes would be fun for the three of them but beneficial for their lives holistically. But Toby's admission about being a father to Jack not only threatens him going on this getaway but whether he will voluntarily be there as husband and father in the long run. This situation hearkens back to Kate's first love, Marc, and the way he treated her despite their admission of love for each other. Through it all, no one may be able to measure up to her father as her biggest support as shown through a story with him of her first night in her first big girl bed at age four. As she thinks about it more, Kate realizes that someone with whom she has always had a relationship with a strained undertone, at least from her side, is truly someone who was and will always be there for her.\u2014Huggo"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "10322332", "rating": 8.3, "votes": 1425, "number_of_episodes": 106}
