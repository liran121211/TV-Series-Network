On this specific day, Rebecca goes into labor, six weeks premature, meaning that the children will have the same birthday as Jack. The stress from what is already considered a difficult pregnancy is ratcheted up a notch when Rebecca's regular doctor becomes incapacitated, leaving her in the care of a doctor she's never met, Dr. Katowski - \"Dr. K\" - he a septuagenarian at that. Regardless, Jack lets Dr. K know in no uncertain terms that losing either Rebecca or any of the three children is not an option. Through the work of a private detective, Randall discovers the name and whereabouts of his biological father, William. Randall had not thought through the implications of this discovery, including the impact on his and his family's life IF he decides to take the next step in meeting/confronting his father. Kevin and Kate have generally taken the path of least resistance to get to where they are. Each may end up taking a chance divergent from that normal path, Kevin's with regard to his career, and Kate's with regard to romance in the form of a wisecracking fellow support group member named Toby.\u2014Huggo", "This day is a very special day for Jack, Kate, Kevin and Randall... it's their birthday!
