Three parallel stories are told. In story one, Rebecca is thirty-three weeks pregnant, and the small pleasures which both she and Jack found in her early pregnancy have changed at least for Rebecca to what seems to be the constant verge of a total emotional breakdown. Regardless, Jack is still trying to keep her spirits up in any way he can. On this day, all Rebecca wants is to be alone, she banishing Jack from the house. In doing so, she doesn't realize that it is his thirty-sixth birthday, he who was looking forward to her annual birthday gift of a sexy Marilyn Monroe styled dance to him wearing only his birthday suit. In his banishment, Jack turns to Miguel for support and advice, Miguel, a father already, who may be able to provide some wisdom out of experience. In story two, Dr. K is both looking forward and not looking forward to a visit from one of his sons, Peter, and his family. Dr. K knows that Peter and his wife Alli will once again try to get him to move on with his life, his wife of fifty-three years, Caroline, who passed away fourteen months ago from cancer. Still talking to Caroline at the breakfast table every morning and having not thrown out any of her prescription medications, Dr. K is closer to wanting to end his life than he is to moving on without Caroline, despite an old friend, Anne, offering him her friendship. In story three, Joe, a fireman, looks to God to repair his long broken marriage to his wife, Samantha. He still loves her, or at least loves the memory of how he felt the first day he met her. That sign from God he believes is something he finds that is left outside the fire hall that day. These three stories will intersect by the end of the day, which will vastly change what looked to be the trajectory of each of the individual stories at the beginning of the day.\u2014Huggo", "A very pregnant Rebecca forgets Jacks birthday & feels absolutely horrible about it.
