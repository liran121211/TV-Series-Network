The well-attended event turns on a dime. Randall's emotions end up much like they were during his high school prom night. In feeling like she needs to support Randall, Beth is less than forthright with him about how her first job interview went. Kevin and Zoe visit Mr. Robinson, Jack's Vietnam War colleague. In wanting to discover the truth about his father's time in the war, Kevin discover more information than expected. In the process, Zoe comes to some conclusions about her relationship with Kevin. Kate and Toby are awaiting the news about how many if any of the eight embryos have resulted in her becoming pregnant. Kate has always shut music out of her life in bad times - like following her father's death. Toby, who went off his anti-depression medication, is slowly feeling the effects. In feeling the need to be the support for Kate, Toby does not want to show the depressive side of himself to her, something that he has dealt with for the better part of his life and that was exacerbated in his teen years with the break-up of his parents' marriage. And in the late 1990s following Jack's death, Miguel is there to support Rebecca and the kids. His reasons for doing so come to light.\u2014Huggo"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "6439894", "rating": 8.1, "votes": 1598, "number_of_episodes": 106}
