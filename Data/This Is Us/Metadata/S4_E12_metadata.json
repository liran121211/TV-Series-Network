He is back in Pittsburgh upon the news from Sophie that her mother Claire has passed away, Claire who was Kevin's biggest fan and booster throughout the entire course of his career. Conversely, Sophie and bigger-than-life-Claire had a love/hate relationship, the strain from Sophie's side largely in their differences. As Kevin reunites with Sophie, he laments that she was the one he let get away who he shouldn't have, those previous times arguably because he wasn't ready, which Claire probably could see, she demonstrating those feelings in her own way. But as Kevin now feels he is ready and has let every woman that has entered his life get away, he may make an impulsive decision which is just as a bad in his current mindset of need of what his parents' had.\u2014Huggo"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "10322328", "rating": 8.7, "votes": 1542, "number_of_episodes": 106}
