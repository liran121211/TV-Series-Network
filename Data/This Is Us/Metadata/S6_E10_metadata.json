Top of mind for Randall is why Rebecca chose Kate as her number two after Miguel and not him because the two of them, with the exception of when he discovered what Rebecca knew about William, have always had a special bond. Randall has also always felt that he was the family's protector after Jack died and that he tried to excel and more often than not did excel at everything he attempted, which is demonstrated in the incidents at the pool when the Big Three were six on the first day of summer and when they got locked in the permanently shut-down facility at age nineteen when Kevin wanted one last blow-out where they had spent much time over the course of their lives. While Randall has already told Jae-Won to hold off the senator who wants to have an important discussion with him, Randall is thrown off track by a move by D\u00e9j\u00e0. While Randall has to deal with the D\u00e9j\u00e0 issue, Rebecca, knowing her son, beats him to the punch by addressing both the issue of not naming him her number two and how to deal with D\u00e9j\u00e0 in his angry state.\u2014Huggo"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "18815408", "rating": 8.6, "votes": 1285, "number_of_episodes": 106}
