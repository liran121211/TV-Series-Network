Key moments in their lives are juxtaposed against similar or comparable situations within the extended Pearson family or those associated with the Pearsons, such as Randall's own short-lived childhood with William. Being pregnant at age 16, Shauna had difficulties in letting go of her childhood to be a responsible single mother to D\u00e9j\u00e0, relying on her own parental figures to do that parenting for her. And even when Shauna tried to do the right thing for her and D\u00e9j\u00e0, something would always go wrong, whether it be a matter of circumstance or a subsequent bad decision by Shauna herself. It was in one of those latter situations that D\u00e9j\u00e0 first met Linda with Child Services, which started her long string of foster care. It was during one of those early foster home situations that D\u00e9j\u00e0 learned the \"wisdom\" of a fellow foster child Raven about what is considered tolerable versus the alternative. In dealing with the Pearsons, Shauna and D\u00e9j\u00e0 may come to some conclusions about if they are able to get themselves to a place of both love and survival as mother and daughter.\u2014Huggo"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "6439880", "rating": 7.8, "votes": 2548, "number_of_episodes": 106}
