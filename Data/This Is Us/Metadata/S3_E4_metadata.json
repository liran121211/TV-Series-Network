Each successive time period shown provides some explanation as to what happens in the later years, from his unhappy and bitter home life with his abusive father to his decision to enlist in the Vietnam War in spite of the fact that he had a medical exemption. But everything done in Jack's life up to this point in time is largely in service to one specific task: to be his younger brother Nicky's protector, with the reason behind him taking on this role with all fiber of his being explained.\u2014Huggo"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "6439900", "rating": 8.0, "votes": 1904, "number_of_episodes": 106}
