In the future, Lucy has just gone into labor a week late. Someone important to both Lucy and Jack rushes to their side after having her latest \"movie star\" date. And in the present, the entire Pearson family is descending on Los Angeles for Jack's first birthday, which coincides with Kevin's one-year sobriety. While Kate, Toby, and Jack welcome the family, they have a special Damon threesome-only secret task, out of which Kate and Toby discuss a not-yet-broached topic regarding their family. An announcement by Rebecca has the potential to overtake the day, while a series of events threaten Kevin making it to one year.\u2014Huggo"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "10322338", "rating": 9.3, "votes": 2021, "number_of_episodes": 106}
