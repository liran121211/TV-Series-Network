00:00:03,069 --> 00:00:06,906
{\an8}<i>In August of 2018,
in the record-breaking heat,</i>

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:12,979
{\an8}<i>over 50,000 fans came
to Ajinomoto Stadium in Tokyo.</i>

3
00:00:14,981 --> 00:00:17,250
<i>The fans that filled the stadium</i>

4
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:22,555
<i>knew the special meaning
behind the concert being held this day.</i>

5
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:29,262
<i>It was a concert celebrating
NEWS's 15th anniversary.</i>

6
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:34,434
{\an8}<i>Walking towards the stage
as the show is about to start</i>

7
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:36,136
{\an8}<i>is Shigeaki Kato.</i>

{\an8}<i>Yuya Tegoshi.</i>

{\an8}YUYA TEGOSHI (AGE 31)

13
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,896
<i>And the member for which this concert
holds a particularly deep meaning,</i>

14
00:01:03,763 --> 00:01:05,031
{\an8}<i>Keiichiro Koyama.</i>

15
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:06,433
{\an8}KEIICHIRO KOYAMA (AGE 34)

16
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:08,001
{\an8}<i>This would be his first appearance</i>

17
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:10,737
{\an8}<i>since resuming activity with the band.</i>

18
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,663
Ride on time<i>, a documentary series.</i>

19
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:42,068
<i>When they debuted, NEWS had nine members.</i>

20
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:45,305
{\an8}<i>But one by one, the members left.</i>

21
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:46,372
{\an8}FIVE MEMBERS DEPART

22
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:50,176
{\an8}<i>After Tomohisa Yamashita
and Ryo Nishikido left,</i>

23
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:54,347
<i>they were called a strawberry shortcake
without the strawberry.</i>

24
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:57,217
<i>Everyone doubted the group could survive.</i>

25
00:01:57,884 --> 00:02:00,120
-Let's have fun and make everyone happy!
-Right!

26
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:01,054
Let's do this!

27
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:05,959
<i>But the four members somehow
made it to their 15th anniversary concert.</i>

28
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:12,298
<i>Playing off the combined meaning of
"one" and "five", its name is</i> Strawberry.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,703
<i>They've overcome many rumors
about their disbandment.</i>

30
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:21,508
<i>This is for their fans who've supported
and waited for them.</i>

31
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:22,775
All right!

32
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:03,416
{\an8}<i>They poured 15 years
of gratitude into their songs.</i>

33
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:53,233
Even if we have to do it
thousands of times,

34
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:55,001
we'll rise, fight

35
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:58,338
and show you all our appreciation.

36
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:02,442
And so, this last song is for all of you.

37
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:11,651
<i>They finish the concert with their song</i>

38
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:13,286
<i>"Ikiro".</i>

39
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:17,624
<i>This single was released after
Koyama's activities were suspended.</i>

40
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:33,533
You're the best!

41
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:34,734
Thank you!

42
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,036
-Thanks so much!
-Thanks!

43
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,072
We're so happy!

44
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:42,108
Let's meet again!

45
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:48,147
<i>The curtain closed
on their 15th anniversary concert.</i>

46
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:52,185
<i>The ending credits rolled on the monitor</i>

47
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,687
<i>to the music of "Ikiro".</i>

48
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:02,328
<i>At that moment, Koyama heard something.</i>

49
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:11,604
<i>The fans started singing their song,</i>

50
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:13,239
<i>"Ikiro".</i>

51
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:04,323
{\an8}Nice to meet you.

52
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,358
{\an8}OCTOBER 2018

53
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:07,794
{\an8}<i>They'll be doing a dome tour</i>

54
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:11,330
{\an8}<i>that starts at the end of 2018
and extends into 2019.</i>

55
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:14,934
<i>Their first concert is on New Year's Eve.</i>

56
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:18,905
{\an8}<i>This dome tour is an encore concert</i>

57
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:23,643
{\an8}<i>to the</i> Epcotia <i>tour that started in March
and was held in eight cities.</i>

58
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:32,151
{\an8}Epcotia <i>is NEWS's ninth album and features
the concept of journeying through space.</i>

59
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,628
<i>The concerts transported the audience
into space.</i>

60
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,364
Are you all ready?

61
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:49,168
<i>The</i> Epcotia <i>tour ended with a big bang.</i>

62
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:51,270
Let's go! And we are...?

63
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:53,039
All together!

64
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:54,674
NEWS!

65
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:03,883
<i>This time, they need to recreate
the arena tour into a dome tour, but...</i>

66
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:09,555
I think we have to change some things
and give the fans

67
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:12,592
something to be surprised about.

68
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:15,461
We can float up...

69
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:18,698
<i>They don't want to repeat
the same concert.</i>

70
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:26,772
<i>How can they entertain the fans
inside the large dome venue?</i>

71
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:31,277
Tegoshi, what's that thing you have?

72
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:33,713
-The Segway?
-Is that fun?

73
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,015
It's fun to ride on.

74
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:38,050
It's super-fast, right?

75
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:39,452
-The speed?
-Yeah, it's fast.

76
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,789
I don't know, I think it would be cool
to go around the venue

77
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,726
riding on something futuristic looking.

78
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:49,295
We can come out on that
to our original music.

79
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:54,467
<i>The one offering detailed suggestions</i>

80
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:58,437
<i>concerning the stage production
is Masuda.</i>

81
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:03,809
<i>After finishing one meeting,</i>

82
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:07,680
<i>Masuda goes into another meeting
by himself.</i>

83
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:11,350
But this part here is...

84
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,654
-How is it?
-Turn around.

85
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:22,728
<i>The one who oversees most of
NEWS's costumes is actually Masuda.</i>

86
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:29,201
{\an8}<i>Yoneyama has been working
with him for eight years.</i>

87
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:31,037
COSTUME MANAGER
YUYA YONEYAMA

88
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:32,305
He has the knowledge.

89
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:36,776
He checks out lots of different
brand names as well as vintage shops.

90
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:40,012
He has so many styles of clothing.

91
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,414
Whatever ideas he has,

92
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,549
I never have to second guess his choices.

93
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:47,286
We have a mutual understanding
in that sense.

94
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:50,523
{\an8}<i>He's a big fashion lover.</i>

95
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:55,461
{\an8}<i>He even has a regular spot in a fashion
magazine featuring his everyday wear.</i>

96
00:09:57,129 --> 00:10:01,734
{\an8}<i>NEWS's costumes have also
been featured in</i> Soen<i>,</i>

97
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:05,004
{\an8}<i>a fashion magazine
with over 80 years of history.</i>

98
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:07,840
{\an8}<i>Masuda's fashion is very highly regarded.</i>

99
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:09,241
{\an8}MASUDA'S SERIAL CORNER "MFFB"

100
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:11,010
{\an8}<i>For example,</i>

101
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:15,181
{\an8}<i>the costumes they wore for
the opening act during their last concert</i>

102
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:19,385
{\an8}<i>were made to look like
they were pilots or conductors</i>

103
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:22,254
{\an8}<i>guiding people on
a journey through space.</i>

104
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,859
{\an8}<i>For the "Chankapana" costumes,</i>

105
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:30,997
{\an8}<i>he gathered pictures of places
that were memorable for each member</i>

106
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,966
{\an8}<i>and printed them onto the fabric.</i>

107
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,543
{\an8}<i>We want to know the thought process
behind his work.</i>

108
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:47,647
{\an8}<i>That's what the documentary staff
were thinking,</i>

109
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:51,851
{\an8}<i>but they were having difficulty
getting close to him.</i>

110
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,388
<i>The other members of the group...</i>

111
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:57,256
-Good morning.
-Hi.

112
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,324
Hello.

113
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:05,464
<i>...had quickly accepted
the cameras for this documentary show.</i>

114
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:10,636
<i>But as for Masuda...</i>

115
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,438
Good morning.

116
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:18,778
<i>We can't seem to get close with him.</i>

117
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:21,914
<i>We had to do something.</i>

118
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:25,951
<i>We tried to talk with him
during a private interview.</i>

119
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:29,689
For some reason,

120
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:34,026
we feel that you have your guard up
and that you're keeping us at a distance.

121
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:35,928
Of course, our being here...

122
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:40,933
might be inconveniencing
the members and the other staff.

123
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,834
Not at all.

124
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:46,472
But the only thing we can do is to
make a great documentary.

125
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,410
But if things continue like this,

126
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,246
we won't be able to relate anything.

127
00:11:55,014 --> 00:12:01,587
Well... we sensed that you probably
don't like documentaries.

128
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:03,089
Yes.

129
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:05,725
Why's that?

130
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:07,760
Documentaries...

131
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:14,400
Well, I'm glad you guys can film a part
of our lives and air it on TV.

132
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:18,204
But... well... as a professional,

133
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:22,842
if I have something I'm working on,

134
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,978
something which will take shape

135
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:30,516
and be sent out to the public,
I put my whole life into it.

136
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,886
Even if I experience
hardships or difficulties,

137
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:41,927
the only thing I want people to see
is the finished product at the end.

138
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:46,565
I don't feel the need
to tell them everything.

139
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:49,969
There's a side of me
that thinks I shouldn't tell them.

140
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:56,208
Personally, I like it when concert DVDs
have behind-the-scene footage.

141
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,543
It's like...

142
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,146
you get a glimpse into

143
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:03,415
how that person is living.

144
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:06,986
I like watching those.

145
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:11,624
So I am looking forward to when this airs.

146
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:15,261
How should I say this...
I don't want anything to be made up.

147
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:18,864
-Was that okay?
-Yes.

148
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,435
<i>He wants us to show his real self.</i>

149
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:27,239
<i>That is Masuda's wish.</i>

150
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,911
<i>For us to better understand Masuda,</i>

151
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:36,816
<i>we ask his fellow band mates
who have been with him for 15 years.</i>

152
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:41,854
Yeah... he's very creative.

153
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:47,459
His creativity is something
I really respect.

154
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:51,030
The pride he has in being a pop idol

155
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:52,832
is just impressive.

156
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:54,633
I've never seen anyone like him.

157
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:56,602
Even among non-idols.

158
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:58,804
I still remember...

159
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:02,575
during high school,
I was busy with schoolwork.

160
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:05,544
But he'd be so particular
about every little thing.

161
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:08,547
I told him, "Who cares?"
and he got so angry.

162
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,583
I was offhandedly saying

163
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:12,551
"Who cares?" or "It doesn't matter."

164
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,220
After I said it several times,

165
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:17,122
he looked at me
with an angry expression and said,

166
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,624
"What did you say?"

167
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,527
Until then, I didn't think he could get
so emotional.

168
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:26,932
I realized that small details were
important to him.

169
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:29,768
Back then, I couldn't understand that.

170
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:32,037
So I saw a new side of him.

171
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:36,208
There's a saying that goes
"God is in the details."

172
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:41,947
There are moments when the small details
end up making a big difference.

173
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:44,850
{\an8}DOME TOUR
BAND REHEARSAL

174
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:48,254
{\an8}<i>Masuda doesn't compromise
when it comes to work.</i>

175
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:51,323
{\an8}<i>During the dome tour,</i>

176
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:54,326
{\an8}<i>there is a number which
they synchronize with the band.</i>

177
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:03,135
<i>This time, there are
four new costumes being made.</i>

178
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:06,672
<i>They've begun discussing the costume
for the number with the band.</i>

179
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,807
For the sweatshirt,

180
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:12,912
the main color will be yellow.
More like mustard actually.

181
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:18,617
{\an8}<i>First, he relays his vision
to the costume designer, Yoneyama,</i>

182
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:21,020
{\an8}<i>regarding the color and shape.</i>

183
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:27,293
<i>Then Yoneyama shapes that vision
into a design.</i>

184
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:41,540
{\an8}<i>They're going to use the sweatshirt
being sold at the concert</i>

185
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:44,076
{\an8}<i>and recreate it with patchwork.</i>

186
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,812
It's changed drastically.

187
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:47,980
Yes, it has.

188
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:52,718
The hood and the cloth material
are the only features left

189
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,854
from the original piece.

190
00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:01,593
<i>They start the meeting
based on the drawing of the design.</i>

191
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:06,165
I want a white T-shirt with red writing

192
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:08,033
and red sweat pants.

193
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,602
How about if it's inside out?

194
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:12,972
And you can see the stitching.

195
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:15,774
Or you can see the pattern inside.

196
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:22,047
<i>From among the various fabric samples,</i>

197
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:24,583
<i>they select which ones
to patch on to the sweatshirt.</i>

198
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:29,888
Is this a little weird? Wait, hold on.

199
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:31,924
Maybe green?

200
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:35,160
If it's green...

201
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:38,697
-Is it too much?
-The color's too similar.

202
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:42,634
How about navy blue or stripes?

203
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:46,572
I know. How about this shade of purple

204
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:48,974
and adding this blue? Is that cute?

205
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,378
Let's do that.

206
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:56,782
<i>He spends time behind the scenes
to design and create costumes.</i>

207
00:16:57,249 --> 00:17:02,254
<i>That is usually done after he leaves
the limelight of being an idol.</i>

208
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:04,289
<i>His time is limited.</i>

209
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:07,226
What time is it?

210
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:09,895
I thought it was afternoon,
but it's night.

211
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,465
<i>He has a strong attention to detail.</i>

212
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:17,669
<i>What he's after is a look that will make
the four members of NEWS stand out.</i>

213
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:22,174
I never think about
how I'll look in the costumes.

214
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:24,376
It's about how NEWS will look.

215
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,880
When the members wear the costumes

216
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:32,017
and think they look great
and like the way they look in them,

217
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:35,120
they become items
that give them confidence.

218
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:38,357
My goal is to have each member
love what he wears.

219
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,329
<i>It's for the members. It's for NEWS.</i>

220
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:49,835
<i>How will Masuda's work turn out?</i>

221
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:55,941
{\an8}<i>Preparations for the concert continues.</i>

222
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:03,816
{\an8}<i>Today, they're taking pictures
for the concert merchandise</i>

223
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,552
<i>such as</i> uchiwa <i>fans.</i>

224
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:18,730
<i>In between the shoot, each member
checks the design of their</i> uchiwa.

225
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,169
This one is... interesting.

226
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:27,172
What about this one?

227
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:28,540
<i>Aside from the</i> uchiwa<i>,</i>

228
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:31,977
<i>they look through every piece
of merchandise that will be sold.</i>

229
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:35,481
I think this will come apart easily.

230
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:39,451
<i>This is a new tote bag.</i>

231
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:41,920
<i>At the members' request,</i>

232
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:44,590
<i>two samples have been prepared.</i>

233
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:47,126
<i>One has a pocket, and one does not.</i>

234
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:53,899
Can you try placing the logo
on the corner to the right?

235
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:58,604
<i>First, they try placing the concert logo
on the one without a pocket.</i>

236
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:00,639
How about in the middle?

237
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:02,941
Not bad?

238
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,378
What's the back like?

239
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:08,814
There's nothing on the back.
Just two lines.

240
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:10,782
So both sides can be used.

241
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:12,584
-Then, let's do that.
-There are no pockets.

242
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,653
Should we go with this?

243
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,489
Then, we'll put the logo
on the back pocket.

244
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,626
Whoever wants to remove it
can turn it around.

245
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:22,427
I like the pocket one.

246
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:23,996
That's already set.

247
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,732
-Yeah.
-We're going with the pockets.

248
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:28,033
If you say something now,

249
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:32,204
it'll sound like you had the final say
on the pockets.

250
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:34,606
We've already decided.

251
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:38,410
We're talking about logo placement.
The pockets have been confirmed.

252
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:39,778
It's nothing new.

253
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,713
You didn't make the final decision.

254
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:45,651
Girls like to carry around small items,
like tablets.

255
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,655
We three already decided to go
with the pockets.

256
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:50,556
Me too.

257
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:52,357
So you agree.

258
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:55,594
And the inner pocket is deeper now.

259
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:58,030
-For the phone.
-The phone fits?

260
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,865
-Perfectly.
-Nice.

261
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:01,600
A mirror can fit in too.

262
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:06,271
It would be cool
if a glasses case was attached to it.

263
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:07,506
Glasses?

264
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:08,707
Once you take them off,

265
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:11,777
-there's no place to put them.
-True.

266
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:13,178
This one.

267
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,682
<i>They were very particular</i>

268
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:20,652
<i>about the fabrics
for the towels and sweatshirts.</i>

269
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:27,559
We choose what we personally like

270
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:29,795
and what we want them to have.

271
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:32,264
We also try to think
from a girl's point of view

272
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:33,865
and of what they would want.

273
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:36,802
We get together and consider everyone's...

274
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,204
ideas.

275
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:42,374
After having all these meetings,
we get attached to it.

276
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:45,210
-That's important.
-That's the main thing.

277
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:47,546
Tegoshi wears it every day.

278
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:49,881
-Yeah. He wears it the most.
-All the time.

279
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:53,952
I always take my NEWS towel
when I play soccer or futsal.

280
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:56,021
-It's the right size?
-Yup.

281
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,222
How does it feel?

282
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:58,257
It feels soft.

283
00:20:59,057 --> 00:20:59,992
It feels good.

284
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:02,227
DECEMBER 2018
11:00 P.M.

285
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:03,595
<i>Late at night one day,</i>

286
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:07,733
<i>we saw Kato working on
something on his laptop.</i>

287
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,238
<i>As an author,</i>

288
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:17,276
<i>he is writing the script
for a certain segment in the concert.</i>

289
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:23,448
{\an8}<i>The theme of the last arena concert</i>

290
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:26,118
{\an8}<i>was journeying through space</i>

291
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:28,287
{\an8}<i>in a space shuttle name
the Epcotia Liner.</i>

292
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,188
{\an8}<i>During their journey, they met...</i>

293
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:33,725
Oh no, they found us.

294
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:36,261
<i>...three aliens.</i>

295
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:37,429
{\an8}What?

296
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:38,363
{\an8}<i>Bonsen.</i>

297
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,798
{\an8}You don't know?

298
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:40,699
{\an8}<i>Kota.</i>

299
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:43,201
{\an8}<i>Kai.</i>

300
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:46,705
Let's try holding hands again.

301
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:51,576
<i>Kato did more than create the story.</i>

302
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,412
Everyone hold hands!

303
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:54,946
Hold hands!

304
00:21:57,516 --> 00:22:00,018
<i>The voice behind the characters...</i>

305
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:02,487
<i>is Kato himself.</i>

306
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:05,957
If everyone will raise their voices,

307
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:07,893
I think I can get up.

308
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:09,995
Maybe a little more...

309
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:12,597
If everyone will raise their voices,

310
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,199
I think I can get up.

311
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:15,500
Is that funnier?

312
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:16,568
I think its fine.

313
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:17,669
I'll try that.

314
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:20,706
<i>It takes a while before he's satisfied.</i>

315
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:24,276
If everyone will raise their voices,

316
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:26,178
I think I can get up.

317
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:31,350
I think I can get up.

318
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:40,926
<i>Why does Kato do this alone
without asking the other members?</i>

319
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,729
It's partly because it's faster this way.

320
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:46,798
There's no time to really explain
what tone I want them to use.

321
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:50,102
The members have no idea
how much work this is.

322
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,671
They'd be surprised to see me doing this.

323
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:56,541
They aren't aware of all I do.
I'd say 70% of the work I do

324
00:22:57,609 --> 00:23:00,078
goes unnoticed.

325
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:01,613
This is a good chance then.

326
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,582
Please air this part.

327
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:08,920
But I do it because I enjoy it. Thank you.

328
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:12,924
{\an8}<i>Next time,</i>

329
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:16,094
{\an8}<i>we follow each member
in his various activities.</i>

330
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:17,596
{\an8}Pardon me.

331
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:21,433
{\an8}Someone once said,
"The Kindaichi you portray is too pretty."

332
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,202
{\an8}I was frustrated by that comment.

333
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:26,638
{\an8}No! Mother!

334
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:32,611
{\an8}<i>He aims to show an expressive and personal
portrayal of Kosuke Kindaichi.</i>

335
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:34,679
{\an8}Call the doctor!

336
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:37,983
{\an8}Hello.

337
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:41,253
{\an8}<i>Koyama meets someone
whom he greatly admires.</i>

338
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:47,392
{\an8}Whenever I'm struggling with something,
you're who I imagine talking with.

339
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:49,127
{\an8}Really? Glad to hear that.

340
