00:00:01,568 --> 00:00:06,573
AFTER TWO YEARS, THEY'VE COME BACK

2
00:00:07,974 --> 00:00:09,342
{\an8}MARCH 22ND, 2018

3
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:10,243
{\an8}<i>On this day,</i>

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:14,080
{\an8}<i>after a two-year long voyage,</i>

5
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:16,750
{\an8}<i>they have returned to where they belong.</i>

6
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:20,120
<i>Their name is</i>

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:21,821
<i>KAT-TUN.</i>

8
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:28,828
There haven't been any issues
with the audience, so we are on time.

9
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:33,900
{\an8}<i>Kazuya Kamenashi, 32 years old.</i>

10
00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:42,108
{\an8}<i>Yuichi Nakamaru, 35 years old.</i>

11
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:49,682
{\an8}<i>Tatsuya Ueda, 35 years old.</i>

12
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,520
Ten minutes left.

13
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:59,959
<i>After a long time,
they are dancing side by side again.</i>

14
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:07,934
<i>Originally they started as a group of six,</i>

15
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:09,536
<i>but they are now three.</i>

16
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:17,710
<i>In a way, they are the opposite
of the flashy image</i>

17
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:19,412
<i>that may be associated with idols.</i>

18
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:23,049
<i>They are men who have
confronted their cruel fate.</i>

19
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:25,952
It's been a while.

20
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:28,121
Should we huddle up?

21
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:33,359
-It's time.
-Let's do it!

22
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:34,327
Hey!

23
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,031
<i>Why did the three of them</i>

24
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:41,634
<i>decide to continue as KAT-TUN?</i>

25
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:45,138
<i>We followed them</i>

26
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:48,007
<i>for 300 turbulent days
after their comeback.</i>

27
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:14,567
<i>This is documentary series</i> Ride On Time.

28
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:21,841
{\an8}2006 KAT-TUN DEBUT LIVE
TOKYO DOME

29
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:27,547
{\an8}<i>Their big debut came in 2006
when they performed to a full audience</i>

30
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:29,415
{\an8}<i>at Tokyo Dome.</i>

31
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:35,355
{\an8}<i>They broke one record after another,
gaining their place in music history.</i>

32
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:38,958
{\an8}<i>Their rise shocked the world.</i>

33
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:45,431
{\an8}<i>A word to describe their charm
would be "wild."</i>

34
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:50,637
<i>They were far from
the typical idol image.</i>

35
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,172
Hey, Dome!

36
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,409
Scream until you can't anymore!

37
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:58,945
Make some noise, you bastards!

38
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,449
<i>However, they had
very different personalities,</i>

39
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,186
<i>so the group faced many challenges.</i>

40
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:10,523
{\an8}<i>For various reasons,</i>

41
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,592
{\an8}<i>one member left after another.</i>

42
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:17,830
{\an8}<i>At times, they'd keep performing together
even after members had decided to quit.</i>

43
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:22,101
{\an8}That created a difficult atmosphere.

44
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:24,637
{\an8}We had to spend several months together

45
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,973
{\an8}after they decided to quit.

46
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:29,209
I can't describe the feelings I had.

47
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:30,777
{\an8}Each of them...

48
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,245
{\an8}TATSUYA UEDA (AGE 35)

49
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:34,981
{\an8}They each have their own life,

50
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,550
{\an8}and decide what kind of life
they want to live.

51
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:42,989
That's something that I
just have to accept.

52
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:48,027
{\an8}<i>Nevertheless,
they decided to stay together</i>

53
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:50,797
{\an8}<i>and took time to recharge.</i>

54
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:54,667
{\an8}<i>They promised the fans they would return.</i>

55
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:57,804
We will prove to you that having this time

56
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,305
is needed to protect KAT-TUN.

57
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:02,508
We're counting on you until then!
Thank you very much.

58
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:07,747
How should KAT-TUN continue?

59
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:10,350
How should we make KAT-TUN grow?

60
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,851
It's a way to show my resolve

61
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,686
to the members who left.

62
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:19,525
And I guess we also have our pride.

63
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:23,162
And the fans.

64
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:29,702
That's why I don't want to be the one

65
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:33,206
to break up the group.

66
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:38,611
Maybe it's the beauty of it...

67
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:43,349
to be able to make KAT-TUN continue.

68
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,153
Or maybe because we feel
we have a responsibility.

69
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:52,725
{\an8}<i>Now it is time to fulfill
that responsibility.</i>

70
00:04:58,197 --> 00:05:00,533
<i>The place they have chosen
for their return</i>

71
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,304
<i>is a sacred place for KAT-TUN,
Tokyo Dome.</i>

72
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:07,573
<i>They will perform there
for three consecutive days.</i>

73
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,613
<i>Preparations began
at the beginning of the year.</i>

74
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,819
{\an8}<i>On this day at a Tokyo studio,</i>

75
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:23,890
{\an8}<i>they're doing a photo shoot for the</i> uchiwa
<i>that will be sold at the concerts.</i>

76
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:28,361
We want cool instead of playful.

77
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:29,595
Okay!

78
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,331
We are going all out already.

79
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:33,433
Let's do our best!

80
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,767
{\an8}KAZUYA KAMENASHI (AGE 32)

81
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:35,835
{\an8}<i>Kamenashi</i>

82
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:38,471
{\an8}<i>joined the show business at age 12.</i>

83
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:39,839
{\an8}<i>It's already been 20 years.</i>

84
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,675
{\an8}<i>He is a disciplined professional</i>

85
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:45,478
{\an8}<i>with a caring attitude.</i>

86
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:48,581
Two years' worth of emotions.

87
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:52,652
<i>He can also make this face, if asked.</i>

88
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:58,291
<i>On the other hand, Ueda...</i>

89
00:05:59,058 --> 00:05:59,992
I took it.

90
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,694
Wasn't it too fast?

91
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:05,098
-I took it because he looked cool.
-Okay.

92
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:08,735
<i>He doesn't react even once
to the compliment.</i>

93
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:13,773
{\an8}<i>He is a man
with an unwavering heart.</i>

94
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:22,515
{\an8}<i>And Nakamaru is a man of ideas,
who likes funny things.</i>

95
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:23,649
{\an8}YUICHI NAKAMARU (AGE 35)

96
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:27,820
<i>Every year, he makes
the same face for his uchiwa.</i>

97
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:32,959
<i>He has little interest
in showing his cool side.</i>

98
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,129
-Let's go with this angle for both sides.
-Okay.

99
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:40,032
Soon people won't have any reason
to buy it anymore.

100
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:46,839
<i>Their appearances and personalities
are so different.</i>

101
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:50,710
<i>When these three people reunite,
they become KAT-TUN.</i>

102
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:58,317
<i>On this day, while discussing
the components of the concerts,</i>

103
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,553
<i>something else happens.</i>

104
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:08,961
{\an8}KAZUYA KAMENASHI'S 32ND BIRTHDAY

105
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:14,934
Congratulations!

106
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:19,405
Tell us your aspirations as a 32-year-old.

107
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:23,643
As a 32-year-old,
I want to move forward

108
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,047
with the group again.

109
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,950
I want to work well together.

110
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:33,986
-I hope you have a good year.
-Yes.

111
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:38,424
{\an8}<i>These concerts are</i>

112
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:42,228
{\an8}<i>centered around the group's hit songs.</i>

113
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:46,899
<i>The most important issue
is how they will present</i>

114
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,201
<i>the renewed KAT-TUN.</i>

115
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:49,969
I remember the swing...

116
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:52,238
Yes, remember that first.

117
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,706
Just the parts you need.

118
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:57,443
{\an8}<i>This video is from</i>

119
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:00,012
{\an8}<i>ten years ago,
when there were six members.</i>

120
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:06,486
So young...

121
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:10,356
<i>This time, they want to be even better.</i>

122
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:18,564
<i>Kamenashi has insisted on redoing
all of the songs from scratch,</i>

123
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:21,334
<i>including each of their singing parts.</i>

124
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,739
In the end, it's the best to
change everything, right?

125
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:28,941
-Yeah.
-Must we go out of our way to do so?

126
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:30,877
If we don't have to...

127
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:33,412
I want to check the balance
and do a brush-up.

128
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,047
Now that it's the three of us.

129
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:35,948
If it's fine...

130
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:36,916
<i>Up until now,</i>

131
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:41,320
<i>one of them would just fill in
for the members who left.</i>

132
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:46,225
<i>However, Kamenashi thinks that
the reborn KAT-TUN</i>

133
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:47,960
<i>needs to make a strong impression.</i>

134
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:52,064
Of course, some parts need to change,
and some parts don't.

135
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:53,366
What doesn't change...

136
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:57,803
Right now, all we're doing
is filling in the empty parts.

137
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,742
I want to brush-up on the balance

138
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:05,278
of those parts again.

139
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:09,415
I think that it's better to not
change them if it's unnecessary.

140
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,418
I'm sure some fans
have become familiar with them.

141
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,721
We want to consider our fans' feelings.

142
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:19,992
Of course, I understand that some parts
match the image of certain members.

143
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,529
That's true for all the songs

144
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:25,064
we are singing this time.

145
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:27,500
We want people to want to listen.

146
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,803
No matter what, it's a fact that
there are only three of us.

147
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:35,041
It's not about someone wanting
to sing a certain part.

148
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:37,410
It's been two years since the 10Ks!

149
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,279
If they see that we
haven't changed anything,

150
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:42,081
it'll seem like we lack variety.

151
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:45,918
I think it would be better
to properly show

152
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:49,855
that we're now a group of three people.

153
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,091
That's why I want to change them.

154
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:56,495
<i>He wants people to think</i>

155
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:58,898
<i>that the current KAT-TUN is better.</i>

156
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:08,341
Okay, please start from the beginning.

157
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:12,678
<i>Kamenashi has been acting</i>

158
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:14,347
<i>since before he debuted.</i>

159
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,516
<i>He also has a job as a newscaster</i>

160
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,318
<i>for a sports program.</i>

161
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:22,655
<i>But even so,</i>

162
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:24,757
<i>he still cherishes the experience</i>

163
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,892
<i>of standing on the stage.</i>

164
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:31,030
It's horrifying to think of
not being able to do it.

165
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:32,832
Being in an environment

166
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:35,167
where I can't sing, dance,
or hold concerts...

167
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:36,936
The other day, on the radio,

168
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,707
and I was able to call my fans.

169
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:44,610
They told me, "I can't wait!"
and I was like, "Oh yeah, that's it!"

170
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:46,646
"That's what this is all about."

171
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:49,248
It should've been obvious,
but it was like...

172
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:51,684
I really got it.

173
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:55,321
We'll have concerts
and people will come...

174
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:57,690
People want to come and there's a raffle.

175
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:01,927
That's why we have to face the concerts

176
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:05,031
with all our might.

177
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:08,601
It's important for me to remind myself
of this foundation.

178
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:13,472
Our foundation is singing, dancing,
and getting cheers in response.

179
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:22,915
{\an8}<i>Kamenashi was born in 1986
in downtown Tokyo,</i>

180
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:25,785
{\an8}<i>as the third son of four children.</i>

181
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:33,125
<i>The name "Kazuya"
came from a character in Touch,</i>

182
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:36,629
<i>which was a popular
baseball manga at the time.</i>

183
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:40,066
<i>He aimed to be a professional
baseball player.</i>

184
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:45,838
<i>He joined the agency</i>

185
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:47,540
<i>when he was 12.</i>

186
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:51,477
<i>An older relative of his
sent in an application on her own</i>

187
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:53,746
<i>and he was selected by chance.</i>

188
00:11:56,515 --> 00:12:01,253
<i>But, worried he would never
make his debut,</i>

189
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,122
<i>he decided to quit the agency</i>

190
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,258
<i>when he took his
high school entrance exams.</i>

191
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:12,565
How many months were there
when I didn't have work or lessons?

192
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:17,670
I studied for the entrance test
and managed to pass the exam

193
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:19,772
for a public school.

194
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:24,243
Then I told Johnny that I was quitting,

195
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:27,980
and he said things like,
"What are you thinking?"

196
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:33,085
"You know, I'm thinking of
making a group."

197
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:34,253
"Ah, is that so?"

198
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:37,089
Like, "Eh? Seriously?"

199
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:42,428
{\an8}<i>And the group was formed was...</i>

200
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:43,662
{\an8}<i>KAT-TUN.</i>

201
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:48,100
{\an8}<i>However, they had strong personalities
and different goals.</i>

202
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:49,969
{\an8}<i>They were always butting heads.</i>

203
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:55,508
{\an8}<i>Before their debut,</i>

204
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:56,909
{\an8}<i>they acted out this scene on the stage.</i>

205
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:58,144
{\an8}What are you doing?

206
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,146
What do you mean?

207
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:01,747
-What's your problem?
-Hey!

208
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:04,850
-What are you doing?
-Come here.

209
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:07,253
<i>In this scene,</i>

210
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:09,889
<i>they are actually reenacting a big fight</i>

211
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,524
<i>they had backstage.</i>

212
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:14,994
<i>At that time,</i>

213
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:18,931
<i>Kamenashi was also
just a selfish young boy.</i>

214
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:24,436
{\an8}<i>Then, in 2005,</i>

215
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:28,207
{\an8}<i>Kamenashi starred in
the hit-drama,</i> Gokusen<i>,</i>

216
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,009
{\an8}<i>and he immediately became a star.</i>

217
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:34,313
<i>What's more, the song he recorded
with Tomohisa Yamashita</i>

218
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:36,615
<i>sold over a million copies.</i>

219
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:38,884
1,628,000 COPIES SOLD

220
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:41,687
{\an8}<i>Eventually,</i>

221
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:44,423
{\an8}<i>despite being the youngest in the group,</i>

222
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:48,060
{\an8}<i>Kamenashi started
to be treated as the leader.</i>

223
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:53,232
<i>That was also something that troubled him.</i>

224
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,102
During performances,

225
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,771
KAT-TUN had a dressing room,

226
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:02,508
and another dressing room
was arranged just for me.

227
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,244
Since I was pretty much the leader.

228
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:07,913
Honestly, it was uncomfortable.

229
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:12,051
But I had to do it.

230
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:15,054
I slowed down the pace of my solo work.

231
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,658
I thought it might be better

232
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:22,228
for us all to stay on the same level
and focus on the group.

233
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:25,097
That's what I told the agency.

234
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:27,867
But at that time, Johnny told me,

235
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:31,103
"If you don't sell,

236
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,472
KAT-TUN will fail."

237
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:36,375
I thought, "So, that's how it is."

238
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:38,878
I felt a lot of pressure.

239
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:41,914
And thought that I needed to work hard.

240
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:48,787
<i>And then, on the same day
as their debut,</i>

241
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:50,623
<i>they had a big concert in Tokyo Dome.</i>

242
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:55,995
<i>When he saw the fans in front of him,</i>

243
00:14:56,328 --> 00:15:01,267
<i>he felt a sense of responsibility
that still remains within him today.</i>

244
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:06,272
<i>Even now as a group of three,</i>

245
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:08,507
<i>there are fans who continue
to support them.</i>

246
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:12,344
<i>Quitting KAT-TUN wasn't an option.</i>

247
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:17,883
Anyway, what I felt was
that there were fans who

248
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,486
supported KAT-TUN as a group.

249
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:24,857
There were people cheering us on,
so I wanted to have confidence in myself.

250
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,358
I also had this feeling...

251
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:32,698
of not wanting to hurt KAT-TUN
any more than it already had been.

252
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,367
I didn't want that.

253
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:37,803
We probably could have just gone on
and gotten past this,

254
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:38,938
But...

255
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:46,512
I don't want us to exist as
that kind of a group.

256
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:47,880
That's why...

257
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:51,116
I'm really thankful to all the fans

258
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:56,388
who have been genuinely supporting us
since the beginning.

259
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:01,193
{\an8}<i>Tomorrow,
they will perform at Tokyo Dome</i>

260
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,861
{\an8}<i>for the first time in two years.</i>

261
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:06,231
{\an8}APRIL 19TH DAY BEFORE CONCERT
TOKYO DOME

262
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:12,905
<i>In one day, the three members
must make their feelings</i>

263
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:16,475
<i>reach the 55,000 people
who will fill this huge venue.</i>

264
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,484
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

265
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:31,156
<i>Kamenashi has arrived at the venue
four hours before the final rehearsal.</i>

266
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:46,105
<i>He reviews
the dance and lyrics of each song.</i>

267
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,859
<i>He's giving his all.</i>

268
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,629
<i>That's his responsibility
towards the fans.</i>

269
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,272
It's good like this.

270
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:31,216
<i>He's checked all 36 songs
that they will sing in the concert.</i>

271
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,551
<i>Every one of them.</i>

272
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,657
{\an8}Good morning.

273
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:41,960
{\an8}Good morning.

274
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:45,364
{\an8}<i>When all the members arrive,</i>

275
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:47,499
{\an8}<i>the final rehearsal starts.</i>

276
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:52,104
<i>Testing...</i>

277
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:53,372
How long...

278
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,009
<i>Especially now with only three,</i>

279
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:59,912
<i>they're feeling the stage's massiveness
all over again.</i>

280
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:06,151
<i>How can they make their performance
reach every corner?</i>

281
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:13,592
Hurry here.

282
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,496
<i>Walking speed...</i>

283
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:20,232
<i>How they will be seen by the audience...</i>

284
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,102
<i>They check every detail.</i>

285
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:26,338
Here...

286
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:32,077
Is it weird if I prolong
the spin at the end?

287
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,246
It's not extended.

288
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:36,148
It's not extended.

289
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:37,716
If it were extended,

290
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,384
I wouldn't have to rush, right?

291
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:41,320
If I don't pay attention,

292
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:43,322
and do whatever I feel like,

293
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:45,324
I won't be facing the audience.

294
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,969
It's not impossible.

295
00:18:58,237 --> 00:18:59,571
<i>First and foremost,</i>

296
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:03,609
<i>the three of them rehearse this song.</i>

297
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:36,008
{\an8}<i>Their opening song,
"Real Face", 2018 version.</i>

298
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:53,091
{\an8}THE RAP HAS ALSO BEEN RE-WRITTEN

299
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:03,368
<i>How will fans react
to the new "Real Face"?</i>

300
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:22,955
<i>And now, the rehearsal
of Kamenashi's cherished solo part begins.</i>

301
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,326
It can be lifted now.

302
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:33,131
-I wait until the very end?
-Yes, wait until the end and then spin.

303
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:39,471
<i>It's a performance in the air.</i>

304
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,356
<i>Furthermore, this time...</i>

305
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:02,928
-Is this done without a lifeline?
-Yes, that's right.

306
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:04,997
There's no lifeline.

307
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:08,433
<i>He's not using a lifeline.</i>

308
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:11,169
I hold my tension like this?

309
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:13,071
Yes, yes, yes.

310
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:14,640
<i>The highlight is this.</i>

311
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:25,050
<i>He holds his fallen body
with just one arm.</i>

312
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:33,225
<i>Holding all of his weight with his hand
is quite burdensome.</i>

313
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:39,231
Damn, it's scary.

314
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:41,566
It's scary.

315
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:44,236
I won't let my right hand go
no matter what.

316
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,208
<i>Instead of relying on
the latest technology,</i>

317
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:52,744
<i>he wants to show his passion.</i>

318
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:59,017
If you rely on equipment or videos,

319
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:00,619
it ends up being about money.

320
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:02,287
It's like...

321
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:05,357
what it means to be an idol...

322
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:11,363
I want to value myself as an artist
and the things that I experience.

323
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,498
If I had to choose,

324
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:16,868
I'm the type of person
who prefers talking face-to-face

325
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:20,439
rather than discussing
things over e-mail.

326
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:25,577
Like when we meet up or have concerts.

327
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:33,318
That's something I really want to value.

328
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,090
<i>The day has finally come.</i>

329
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:41,126
APRIL 20TH
FIRST CONCERT SINCE THEIR RETURN

330
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:45,263
<i>However,
something has happened to Kamenashi.</i>

331
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,134
My right arm is not good.

332
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:54,673
Flying is really tiring.

333
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,443
It takes a lot of energy.

334
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:03,014
<i>It's a passionate performance.</i>

335
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:06,385
<i>The price of that is not small.</i>

336
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:14,326
<i>Will the concerts be a success?</i>

337
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:18,797
{\an8}<i>Next time,</i>

338
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:21,533
{\an8}<i>their first Dome concerts
in two years will begin.</i>

339
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:26,972
{\an8}<i>We'll hear the thoughts
of Ueda and Nakamaru,</i>

340
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:30,409
{\an8}<i>who support the band alongside Kamenashi.</i>
