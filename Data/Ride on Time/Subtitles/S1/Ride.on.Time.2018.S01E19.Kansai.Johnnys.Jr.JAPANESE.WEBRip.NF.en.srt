00:00:01,768 --> 00:00:03,003
Thank you.

2
00:00:03,069 --> 00:00:05,038
Thank you.

3
00:00:05,105 --> 00:00:06,406
Thank you.

4
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:11,878
{\an8}<i>On this day, a group of idols
based in Osaka</i>

5
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:14,381
{\an8}<i>faces a new beginning.</i>

6
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:16,449
{\an8}KANSAI JOHNNY'S JR.

7
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,218
{\an8}<i>It is Kansai Johnny's Jr.</i>

8
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:20,253
{\an8}<i>and the unit that was born from them,</i>

9
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:24,224
{\an8}<i>Naniwa Danshi.</i>

10
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:27,794
{\an8}<i>At the Christmas performance
that is coming up,</i>

11
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,529
{\an8}<i>they will have to show their worth.</i>

12
00:00:31,264 --> 00:00:33,533
{\an8}We are motivated to work harder

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,037
{\an8}to become known to more people,
and to make them say

14
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:40,140
{\an8}the next unit to debut
will come from Kansai.

15
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:41,808
You'll be even more nervous.

16
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,710
-Hey!
-Wait a second.

17
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:45,178
Don't say that.

18
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:48,348
Ready... Viva!

19
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:49,416
What in the world?

20
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,786
How many times must we do this?

21
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:18,211
<i>This is documentary series</i> Ride On Time.

22
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:24,717
{\an8}<i>They are all the rage
in the Kansai region,</i>

23
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:26,853
{\an8}<i>Kansai Johnny's Jr.</i>

24
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:35,595
<i>Last autumn, Naniwa Danshi
had the privilege of performing</i>

25
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:38,665
<i>on their dream stage
at the Kanjani∞ dome concert.</i>

26
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:47,807
It was so fun.

27
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:52,245
<i>And they made a promise.</i>

28
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:56,683
{\an8}We can't always be relying on others.

29
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,486
{\an8}We'll come back here
with our own strength.

30
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:07,794
{\an8}<i>Their first step is to
successfully complete 35 performances</i>

31
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:11,698
{\an8}<i>during their month-long residency
at Osaka Shochikuza Theatre.</i>

32
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:12,665
{\an8}OSAKA SHOCHIKUZA THEATRE

33
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,601
{\an8}NOVEMBER 29TH, 2018

34
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:16,903
{\an8}<i>It's the day before the opening day.</i>

35
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:21,608
After the second song,
when "Awatenbou" begins,

36
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:22,642
we circle around.

37
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:25,311
Will we make it in time?

38
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:27,180
<i>All the Kansai Johnny's Jr. members</i>

39
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:29,215
<i>will work together to tackle this event.</i>

40
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:32,285
-Everyone, gather at the center.
-Yes.

41
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,123
<i>Each of the members have
their own unique talents.</i>

42
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,696
<i>Those with high-level guitar technique</i>

43
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,902
<i>and those with a good sense of humor.</i>

44
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:59,479
If you do it ten times, you get 100 yen.

45
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:00,380
One hundred?

46
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:01,781
<i>Their ages range from</i>

47
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,918
<i>elementary school kids
to youths in their 20's.</i>

48
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:11,658
<i>That is the charm of Kansai Johnny's Jr.</i>

49
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:15,461
{\an8}I think what makes
Kansai Johnny's Jr. special

50
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:19,132
{\an8}is the fact that each member
has a unique personality.

51
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:30,076
<i>What kind of performance will they put on?</i>

52
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:37,617
{\an8}How long have you been there?

53
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:41,154
{\an8}From when you were butchering the piano.

54
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:49,829
{\an8}NOV. 29, 2018
OSAKA SHOCHIKUZA THEATRE

55
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,364
{\an8}<i>The day before opening day,</i>

56
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:53,633
{\an8}<i>Naniwa Danshi's leader, Kazuya Ohashi,</i>

57
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,370
{\an8}<i>was more nervous than anyone else.</i>

58
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:58,738
{\an8}KAZUYA OHASHI (AGE 21)

59
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:01,241
<i>This concert will start off</i>

60
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:05,878
<i>with his solo performance
of Mariah Carey's iconic song,</i>

61
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,314
<i>"All I Want for Christmas is You."</i>

62
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:15,989
<i>During practice, it was decided
that he will sing</i>

63
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:17,957
<i>this vocally demanding song.</i>

64
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,233
{\an8}<i>It happened five days ago.</i>

65
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:30,536
{\an8}<i>Ohkura from Kanjani∞,
who is in charge of the composition</i>

66
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:34,140
{\an8}<i>and stage direction of the show,
focused on Ohashi's</i>

67
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:36,743
{\an8}<i>trademark countertenor voice.</i>

68
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:42,181
<i>What they're worried about
is the last high note.</i>

69
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:46,619
It's fine. It'll be okay.

70
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:48,054
Okay, I'll sing it.

71
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,189
<i>To help them mature,</i>

72
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:52,458
<i>Ohkura wants them to try out something</i>

73
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:54,260
<i>a little more challenging.</i>

74
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:58,531
I'm sure everything

75
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:02,135
they do will be
a learning experience for them.

76
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:06,773
I am very excited to see what kind of
people they will become.

77
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:08,341
Yes.

78
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,877
{\an8}<i>It's the opening day.</i>

79
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,912
{\an8}<i>They practice until the very end.</i>

80
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:33,299
Okay.

81
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:36,469
-That's how we'll do it.
-Thank you.

82
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,307
<i>Ohkura and Ohashi</i>

83
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:44,711
<i>were checking the high notes
that come out in the chorus,</i>

84
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:46,913
<i>over and over again.</i>

85
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:54,987
{\an8}<i>The show's variety corner was composed</i>

86
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:57,190
{\an8}<i>and directed by KANJANI∞'s Yokoyama.</i>

87
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:59,592
{\an8}YOU YOKOYAMA

88
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,494
{\an8}SHOTA YASUDA

89
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:03,663
{\an8}<i>KANJANI∞'s Yasuda provided the music.</i>

90
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:08,768
-You're so cute. Do your best.
-Yes!

91
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:09,769
{\an8}SHINGO MURAKAMI

92
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:12,538
{\an8}<i>And KANJANI∞'s Murakami
also came to visit.</i>

93
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:18,277
Yokoyama and Ohkura's
presence really increased

94
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:21,547
their chances a lot, I think.

95
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:25,718
In that sense,
how they will seize this opportunity

96
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:29,255
depends on their judgment.

97
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:32,091
In a way, I do feel envious.

98
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,931
<i>The show will soon begin.</i>

99
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:45,405
I'm nervous.

100
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:48,808
What outfit is this?

101
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,012
-You have eight minutes.
-Okay.

102
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,248
What are you holding?

103
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:00,052
<i>It's finally showtime.</i>

104
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,891
<i>Worried, Ohkura is also by the stage wing.</i>

105
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:12,598
<i>Will Ohashi pull off Mariah Carey's
"All I Want for Christmas is You"?</i>

106
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,601
<i>Everyone held their breath
as they listened.</i>

107
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:25,111
<i>In the end,</i>

108
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:27,780
<i>he wasn't able to keep the high notes</i>

109
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,417
<i>during the most important chorus.</i>

110
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:36,589
<i>But there are no second chances.</i>

111
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,724
<i>That's show business.</i>

112
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,352
<i>And the variety corner...</i>

113
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,287
Santa Danshi!

114
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:10,723
Nailed it.

115
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:15,027
We're Kyara Jutai Santa!

116
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:18,231
Is that supposed to be cool?

117
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:23,002
Thank you so much for today!

118
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:24,270
See you again.

119
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,908
<i>On the opening day,</i>

120
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:31,811
<i>no one looked satisfied with the outcome.</i>

121
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:34,547
Good work.

122
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:37,850
<i>Of course, that includes Ohashi.</i>

123
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:40,620
-Hey.
-Good work.

124
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,024
It's my fault.

125
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:48,461
-It's my fault. Because I messed up.
-About what?

126
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:51,898
-I started off on the wrong foot.
-I didn't notice.

127
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:54,700
-No, I messed up.
-But that was...

128
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:03,342
Ohkura had put all that together for me,

129
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:06,412
but I wasn't able to make
the most out of it.

130
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,014
That is frustrating.

131
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:11,817
I'm sure a lot of things will happen
from now on,

132
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:14,787
but I'll take this as a personal trial.

133
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:18,190
I have to become stronger mentally.

134
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:20,760
The one before this.

135
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:23,563
<i>An evaluation meeting
in the hallway backstage.</i>

136
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:31,804
It's such a waste when you look down, Toa.

137
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:36,242
They're really working hard,

138
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:39,412
so I feel like for their sake,

139
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:41,814
I need to think of something

140
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,783
to get the audience laughing.

141
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,821
<i>In order to live up to those expectations,</i>

142
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,891
<i>each one of them must improve themselves</i>

143
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:54,694
<i>during the span of this month.</i>

144
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:59,865
<i>Meanwhile, they have other jobs lined up.</i>

145
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,569
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

146
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:05,771
Good morning.

147
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:07,940
Good morning.

148
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:10,710
{\an8}Kansai Johnny's Jr. no Bari Bari Sound.

149
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,812
{\an8}<i>On this day, they had their radio show.</i>

150
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,216
{\an8}<i>The members are Naniwa Danshi's Fujiwara,</i>

151
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,019
{\an8}<i>Ohashi, Takahashi,</i>

152
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:26,726
{\an8}<i>and the one who supports the show
with his guitar skills,</i>

153
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:27,893
{\an8}<i>Yoshinori Masakado.</i>

154
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,630
{\an8}This is a request from a listener.

155
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:31,797
<i>He's a sincere man.</i>

156
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:33,866
"I Gotta Feeling" by The Black Eyed Peas.

157
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:40,606
<i>After he dyed his hair black
for a certain job,</i>

158
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:44,377
<i>we met up with Masakado to film him
practicing his guitar.</i>

159
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:46,112
Good morning.

160
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:48,481
When were we supposed to meet?

161
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:49,649
Half past one.

162
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:56,756
You can tell how nervous I am
by how early I got here.

163
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:05,665
<i>At first, he started learning
the guitar on his own.</i>

164
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,567
<i>But he took up lessons,
so he could use it</i>

165
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:10,269
<i>in his activities as a Jr. member.</i>

166
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:20,079
I'm sure people would say,
he's good for being an idol.

167
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:22,348
They'll always have preconceptions.

168
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:23,716
And so,

169
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,885
if I can excel at something

170
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,853
and reach the same level

171
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:31,891
as a so-called professional,
people will be surprised to see

172
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:34,860
a Johnny's member like that, I'm sure.

173
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:37,863
I want to overwhelmingly
exceed their expectations.

174
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,899
Not just a little bit.

175
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:49,141
<i>This day, Ohkura came to check on
Masakado and the band.</i>

176
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,043
The outro...

177
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:07,860
<i>How will their senior
evaluate their skills?</i>

178
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:21,140
-Amazing.
-Isn't it?

179
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:22,675
-Amazing.
-Right?

180
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:27,980
<i>The amount of time
he's dedicated to it has paid off.</i>

181
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,086
<i>Meanwhile, tonight is...</i>

182
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:43,262
{\an8}<i>the day of Ohashi's weekly vocal lesson.</i>

183
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:45,831
{\an8}KAZUYA OHASHI (AGE 21)

184
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,876
<i>He feels a strong sense
of responsibility as someone</i>

185
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:59,011
<i>who leads Naniwa Danshi with his vocals.</i>

186
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:05,551
I don't know what it sounds like outside.

187
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:06,619
Outside?

188
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:09,021
-I mean, to the audience.
-On our end?

189
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:11,090
Is it good or bad?

190
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:14,260
When I hear myself in the recording,

191
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:16,729
it sounds really bad.

192
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,566
<i>Ohashi joined the agency nine years ago.</i>

193
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:23,002
<i>His goal has always been to debut.</i>

194
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:24,937
<i>Naniwa Danshi</i>

195
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:27,373
<i>is the agency's first unit in four years.</i>

196
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:30,810
<i>He doesn't want it to end as a failure.</i>

197
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:35,981
I only have one chance,
considering my age.

198
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:40,052
So I want to seize this opportunity.

199
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:41,787
I believe each of us

200
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:45,891
has to work hard individually in order
to succeed in that.

201
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:49,028
I've always been conscious of
working hard as individuals.

202
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:51,997
All we can do is work hard.

203
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:54,266
Really.

204
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:57,469
<i>On this day,</i>

205
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:00,272
{\an8}RYUTA MURO

206
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,842
{\an8}<i>The oldest member of Kansai Johnny's Jr.,</i>

207
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:06,779
{\an8}<i>Ryuta Muro, was also trying
to pave a new road for himself.</i>

208
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:10,182
Today, I am solo.

209
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:14,086
Thinking I can't afford
to make any mistakes

210
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:16,722
makes me nervous, and I end up messing up.

211
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,960
Look at the center, please.

212
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:23,696
<i>Muro will be playing the role</i>

213
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:26,966
<i>of a</i> rakugoka <i>in a stage play
starting in February.</i>

214
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:32,271
<i>He is especially nervous.</i>

215
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,009
Do you and your character
share any similarities?

216
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:39,211
We're taking on challenges.

217
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:42,214
His desire to make it big

218
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:47,219
is similar to how I feel,

219
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,488
in my opinion.

220
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,056
-At first...
-Yes?

221
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:52,024
<i>At this point,</i>

222
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:55,661
<i>nobody knew that Kansai Johnny's Jr.</i>

223
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:58,530
<i>was about to change.</i>

224
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:01,667
It's easier to remember that way.

225
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:05,304
{\an8}DECEMBER 2018
OSAKA SHOCHIKUZA THEATRE

226
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:06,939
{\an8}<i>Mid-December,</i>

227
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:10,476
{\an8}<i>their month-long residency
has reached its midpoint.</i>

228
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:16,849
<i>They were already preparing
for their next big performance.</i>

229
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:21,186
<i>Two consecutive days
at Osaka-Jo Hall in the New Year.</i>

230
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,857
Good work. We don't have much time left,

231
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,159
so we have to get on it

232
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,228
or we won't make it in time.

233
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:30,896
It's not just one thing.

234
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:34,900
We're doing multiple things at once,
and that makes me so happy.

235
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,769
-Now...
-It feels like we're working.

236
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:39,705
-It's like we're superstars.
-I know!

237
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:42,041
<i>The sense of fulfillment
wins over fatigue.</i>

238
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,376
...we're multitasking, and I'm so happy.

239
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:49,815
<i>But on the other hand,</i>

240
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:53,619
<i>as they perform one day after the next,</i>

241
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:57,323
<i>some members may have become stagnant.</i>

242
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,627
<i>Fujiwara was concerned about that.</i>

243
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:10,069
<i>Is Naniwa Danshi
really moving forward every day?</i>

244
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:15,207
<i>That was when...</i>

245
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:18,610
Can I ask you a question?

246
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:20,980
Sure, no problem.

247
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:22,414
<i>A member came up</i>

248
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:26,118
<i>to Fujiwara to pitch an idea
for the variety corner.</i>

249
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:28,821
...a lot of questions like this.

250
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,091
{\an8}<i>Sota Okumura.</i>

251
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,192
{\an8}By the pillar...

252
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:34,593
{\an8}<i>He joined six years ago.</i>

253
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,061
Diagonally, like this.

254
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:38,030
<i>He's been diligently working hard.</i>

255
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:42,067
Such a nice voice.

256
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:44,370
<i>He has a silky voice</i>

257
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:46,772
<i>and a good sense of humor.</i>

258
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:50,509
What's your favorite food?

259
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,478
<i>Shirataki.</i>

260
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:56,348
-How cool!
-Very nice.

261
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:59,852
I thought of questions and answers

262
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:01,253
that might be funny.

263
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,488
{\an8}WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE ANIMAL? GIRAFFE

264
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:04,056
<i>Okumura</i>

265
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:06,492
<i>has come up with multiple ideas.</i>

266
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:09,661
I like the one about the animal.

267
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:11,430
We can use that giraffe thing.

268
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:13,899
Last night,

269
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,202
I asked Okumura
if he could think of something,

270
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:18,537
and he said yes.

271
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:21,974
And the next day,
he already has six ideas.

272
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:26,011
I can see that everyone wants

273
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:30,616
the variety corner to succeed,
and that makes me want to work harder.

274
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,987
<i>Without delay, they used it that day.</i>

275
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,490
What's your favorite animal?

276
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:40,826
The giraffe.

277
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,666
<i>With his hard work,
he got the crowd laughing.</i>

278
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:53,072
<i>He wanted to let the members
of Naniwa Danshi know.</i>

279
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:55,541
<i>After the show,</i>

280
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,713
<i>Fujiwara called all the members
into one room.</i>

281
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:08,921
<i>The voices we overheard
were filled with anger.</i>

282
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:12,791
What are you thinking?

283
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:16,995
Do you want to continue
as a member of Naniwa? If you're thinking,

284
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:19,231
"I don't care," you should just quit.

285
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:21,500
People like Okumura and Sano

286
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:24,336
put so much thought
into the variety corner.

287
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:25,838
I asked them yesterday,

288
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:28,440
for one idea
and they gave me three or four.

289
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,110
I ask for one
and they give back three or four.

290
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:33,679
I ask you guys for one,
and what have you given me?

291
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:34,780
Nothing.

292
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:39,017
I don't even know
if there's a point to this.

293
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,620
There's no reason in doing this.

294
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,289
Actually...

295
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,000
Excuse me.

296
00:18:57,936 --> 00:18:59,738
{\an8}DAIGO NISHIHATA (AGE 22)

297
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:05,177
{\an8}I do feel like this group is in
a grave situation right now.

298
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:08,180
Did you say things you didn't want to say?

299
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:09,715
Yes.

300
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:12,484
But, we're a team.

301
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,389
It hurts me to say these things...

302
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:22,961
but I do hope they get the message.

303
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:24,463
Yes.

304
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:30,402
It'll depend on how those kids change,
and us as well.

305
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:32,471
We'll see.

306
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:40,579
<i>The next day...</i>

307
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:45,150
-Are you free?
-Yeah.

308
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:46,785
Are you free?

309
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:50,856
Try it with music.

310
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:52,124
Yes, thank you.

311
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:15,347
What they said was true.

312
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,250
We won't become any better

313
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:21,587
if we're just sleeping
in our dressing rooms.

314
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,556
It'd be better if I practiced here.

315
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,225
That's why I'm here.

316
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:27,593
I was grateful.

317
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,096
That they would scold us like that
for our sake.

318
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:42,841
<i>What's important is to always remember</i>

319
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:44,776
<i>what your goal is.</i>

320
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,948
After that talk we had,

321
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:51,516
we've become more motivated,

322
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,986
and we're moving toward a good direction.

323
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:56,655
In team sports, whether or not you have

324
00:20:56,989 --> 00:21:00,125
good teamwork changes
your odds of winning.

325
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:02,427
To us, this is a team sport.

326
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:04,429
Everything about it is.

327
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:07,733
Whether it's a small game or big game,

328
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:12,471
we will win
and defeat Tokyo, and together,

329
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:14,806
we want to become known nationwide.

330
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:15,807
Yes.

331
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:17,809
KANSAI JOHNNY'S JR.
X'MAS PARTY!! 2018

332
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:20,979
<i>The shows are coming close to their end,</i>

333
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:22,247
<i>and it is Christmas Eve.</i>

334
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:27,319
<i>Every day, at the beginning of each show,</i>

335
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:29,254
<i>Ohashi has been singing</i>

336
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:32,891
<i>"All I Want for Christmas is You"
without a break.</i>

337
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:37,296
<i>And today...</i>

338
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:39,431
<i>Ohashi succeeded in singing</i>

339
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:42,901
<i>that chorus while retaining the high note.</i>

<i>On the next</i> Ride On Time<i>...</i>

341
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:58,450
{\an8}<i>Kansai Johnny's Jr. members move on
to the next stage.</i>

342
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:04,456
{\an8}<i>They will face a concert at an arena</i>

343
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:06,525
{\an8}<i>that seats around 60,000.</i>

344
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,461
{\an8}<i>It's like we have 400 meters to go.</i>

345
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:11,496
{\an8}<i>It's the hardest leg.</i>

346
