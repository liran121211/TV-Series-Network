Going down.

3
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:11,111
<i>How brutal will the show be?</i>

4
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:13,313
<i>This device provides the answer.</i>

5
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:20,053
<i>While letting themselves be rotated
at high speed, they keep drumming.</i>

6
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:25,191
Three more spins and I'll probably puke.

7
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:51,117
<i>This is documentary series</i> Ride On Time.

8
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:59,092
{\an8}<i>A six-man unit whose athleticism is superb
even by Johnny's Jr. standards,</i>

9
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,660
{\an8}<i>Snow Man.</i>

10
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:06,933
{\an8}<i>A grand show to further their careers has
been made for them to perform in spring.</i>

11
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:14,407
{\an8}I hope to take the audience into the world
of ultimate Japanese entertainment.

13

{\an8}<i>The first stage on which they'll perform
in this endeavor</i>

14
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:21,748
{\an8}<i>will be in the birthplace
of Kabuki, Kyoto.</i>

15
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:27,387
{\an8}<i>The name of the show is</i>
Takizawa Kabuki ZERO.

16
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:33,426
{\an8}<i>In the short time they've had to prepare,
they've had to overcome many high hurdles.</i>

17
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:36,696
Nice smiles, please!

18
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:41,868
{\an8}<i>More than anything, this has called for
an even deeper sense of unity.</i>

{\an8}<i>POTATO</i> MAGAZINE SHOOT

20
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,639

21
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:49,142
{\an8}<i>an additional three members
have been added,</i>

22
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:51,444
{\an8}<i>making them a unit of nine.</i>

23
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:53,213
{\an8}3 NEW MEMBERS TURN 6 TO 9

24
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:56,816
{\an8}I think what we have to do now is
actually try out all kinds of things.

25
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,854
{\an8}Surely we need to explore, right?
Now that there's nine of us.

26
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:07,994
<i>However, unused to this style of training,
one member went through a hard time.</i>

27
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:11,965
They're so fast!

28
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:16,002

Kansai Johnny's Jr. before now.</i>

{\an8}KOJI MUKAI (AGE 24)

30
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:19,472
It's not so much strenuous
as it is unfamiliar.

31
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,242
I guess I'm used to having it easier.

32
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:30,316
<i>A new wind is blowing
in Snow Man's direction.</i>

33
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:36,156
{\an8}I've always wanted to protect this group.

34
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:40,593
We wanted to be that one step
ahead of other groups.

35
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,963
And now we've grown by three members,
and we're a new Snow Man.

36
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,568
<i>However, as the inheritors
of the</i> Takizawa Kabuki <i>name,</i>

37
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:51,638
<i>the level demanded of them is sky-high.</i>

38
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:55,074
<i>As the first show draws near,</i>

39
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:57,911
<i>it's been a relentless process
of trial and error.</i>

40
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:03,550
After the "soiya",
the drummers here go "hah".

41
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,618
Over there, too.

42
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:11,424
{\an8}There isn't a single scene
that we've perfected yet.

43
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:13,560
It's getting really scary.

44
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:15,295
It's bad.

45
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:20,233
{\an8}<i>However, as they head for
the opening night,</i>

46
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,403

{\an8}JANUARY 2019 TOKYO

48
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,809
Good morning.

49
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:35,048
<i>The boys will be undergoing
a new experience today</i>

50
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:37,317
<i>and seem a little nervous about it.</i>

51
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:42,689
Doesn't that look good on you?

52
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,390
-Seriously?
-It does.

53
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:48,828
<i>They're checking the wigs
and practicing the makeup</i>

54
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,496
<i>for the Kabuki part of the show.</i>

55
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:56,569
<i>Iwamoto will be playing
the famous Ishikawa Goemon.</i>

56
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,605
The kumadori, please.

57
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,443
<i>Kumadori is a unique style of makeup
used in Kabuki.</i>

58
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:07,080
<i>Even the rough outline of the process
lists 15 stages of application.</i>

59
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:10,617
Start at the top and really daub it on.

60
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:13,019
-I can just go for it?
-Yes, absolutely.

61
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,354
Yes, that bit, too.

62
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,123
<i>Actors' white face paint
is also new to him, naturally.</i>

63
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,826
That's it, that's it. Go down now.

64
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:21,894
Now pat it down. Pat, pat, pat.

65
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,564
Let's do it.

66
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,867
<i>Finally, it's on to the real deal.</i>

67
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,772
<i>This is the only time he'll have it
done for him.</i>

68
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:37,644
<i>When it's the show, he'll have to draw
every single stroke himself.</i>

69
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:40,913
You have a slender face, don't you?

70
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:45,885
You have to look at the whole face.
The angles aren't what you think they are!

71
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:48,621
That's it! Very good.

72
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:53,259
<i>What's more, if he doesn't complete
every step within eight minutes,</i>

73
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:55,228
<i>he won't make it to the stage in time.</i>

74
00:04:56,896 --> 00:05:00,400
Go right up. Just like that. Go up.

75
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:05,171
The show will end
while I'm still doing my makeup.

76
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,075
You'll get faster than you are now.

77
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:13,179
<i>Once the wig is on, the work is complete.</i>

78
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,416
-How cool do you look?
-Wow!

79
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:18,051
You look great.

80
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:22,822
<i>This is in fact
an extremely difficult challenge</i>

81
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:25,358
<i>in comparison with
past</i> Takizawa Kabuki <i>shows.</i>

82
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,696
-Didn't Tackey wear a mask?
-He did.

83
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:31,764
Yes, even he didn't do the makeup.

84
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:34,200
-Huh?
-That's right!

85
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,869
-I think this is a first.
-Nobody else has done it.

86
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:40,039
Nobody has done their own makeup.
Give it your all!

87
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,808
-Yeah.
-Yeah? I'll give it my all!

88
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:45,945
-That's the spirit.
-You can do it!

89
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:51,984
<i>Learning it's a new challenge,
the other members are spurred on. But...</i>

90
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:56,222
I'm really crap at this.

91
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,463
If you mess up once...

92
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,531
-It's ruined.
-You'll run out of time.

93
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:06,432
You will.

94
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,601
I got it in my eye and now it's watering.

95
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:15,174
<i>Taking on a similarly difficult task</i>

96
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:21,013
{\an8}<i>are Mukai, Sakuma and Meguro, who've been
trusted to be the central drummers.</i>

97
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,316
{\an8}REN MEGURO (AGE 22)

98
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:25,752
The bits where you shout are confusing me.

99
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:29,255
When you shout,
you lose track of where you are.

100
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:36,496
<i>After this, their eyes are met
with an unbelievable sight.</i>

101
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:40,900
{\an8}JANUARY 2019

102
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:43,770
{\an8}<i>It's waiting for them in a warehouse.</i>

103
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:50,009
<i>Placed in the center of the ring
of taiko drummers,</i>

104
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,545
<i>this device has been dubbed
the Mecha Taiko.</i>

105
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:55,281
<i>The trio will ride it as they drum.</i>

106
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:58,184
This makes for a shocking image.

107
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,119
It's like we're being crucified!

108
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:07,260
<i>They climb up,
and try using it while shut inside.</i>

109
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,263
I'm scared!

110
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:16,369
<i>In the real thing, they'll have to keep
drumming even as they're being lowered.</i>

111
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,375
Are we supposed to hold ourselves up
with our feet?

112
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:24,410
-That's right.
-Oh, man.

113
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,780
I'm going to lower you now.

114
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:32,018
<i>The Mecha Taiko takes them
from a 90-degree angle</i>

115
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:34,253
<i>and moves them even lower.</i>

116
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:41,093
<i>Great abdominal strength is required.</i>

117
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:43,830
<i>Furthermore, their entire body weight</i>

118
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:46,432
<i>must be held by
their feet alone using hooks.</i>

119
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:49,802
This is crazy!

120
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,908
-Does the blood run to your head?
-Yeah, really badly.

121
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:57,944
-Mind your head.
-Oh, yeah.

122
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:00,313
Spin it a little harder.

123
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:02,615
Getting faster.

124
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,352
This is still doable.

125
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:07,620
Whoa, this is fast!

126
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,058
-We'll lower you now.
-Okay.

127
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:13,159
Take it away.

128
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,701
Takizawa-kun!

129
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:23,336
How was it, Sakuma?

130
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:25,104
Is that the speed we'll do it at?

131
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:26,572
More or less.

132
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:29,809
-Maybe a little faster if it looks better.
-Really?

133
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,852
<i>Their physical and mental strength
will be tested</i>

134
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,421
<i>in what could be considered
the zenith of the show.</i>

135
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,663
<i>They're already exhausted.</i>

136
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:53,766
Is it tough?

137
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:56,369
Is it tough on the body?

138
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,638
On the body?

139
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:04,310
The blood rushes to your head
and your brain stops working.

140
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:06,879
If I didn't constantly tense my stomach,

141
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:11,417
I'd probably slip down in some bits. So if
I tense, I should be able to drum fine.

142
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:14,020
-All three of you?
-Yes.

143
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:17,156
I think I'll puke after three more spins.

144
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:21,727
It's that bit where you have
to sit up and drum.

145
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:24,163
Could we maybe come back to here?

146
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,199
Got it, let's do that.
Can you move like this after that?

147
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:30,403
I think we should be able to do it
moving back.

148
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:37,143
{\an8}<i>On that same day, Miyadate takes on
another part of the show</i>

149
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:39,612
{\an8}<i>without any of his band mates.</i>

150
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:40,746
{\an8}Are you okay?

151
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:44,317
{\an8}RYOTA MIYADATE (AGE 25)

152
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:49,188
<i>It's the flying scene,
something previously done by Takizawa.</i>

153
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,957
That might be the safest way.

154
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:52,458
-Right.
-Okay.

155
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,460
That's good.

156
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,963
You're going to spin. Ready?

157
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:58,664
One, two.

158
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:02,301
<i>Snow Man are taking over
the lead roles from Takizawa.</i>

159
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:06,939
<i>It seems that this responsibility
is beginning to dawn on them.</i>

160
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:14,013
I've always been someone who
manages something and leaves it at that.

161
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,450
But I've been made to think again

162
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:24,256
about adding my own flavor
or style to something

163
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:26,292
after I've learned just how to do it.

164
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:29,128
I want to take things five steps forward.

165
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:32,965
Not just one step,
but five steps ahead of where I am.

166
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:37,737
What I want to surpass is
my previous self, I suppose.

167
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,242
<i>As the opening performance nears,</i>

168
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:46,379
<i>the tension in the training room
has started to bubble over.</i>

169
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,752
<i>This scene features a sword fight.</i>

170
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,322
{\an8}<i>A platform is supported by just
two boards on each side.</i>

171
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:58,958
{\an8}<i>No nails are used.</i>

172
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:01,427
The bottom, Masakado! It's out of place.

173
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,563
Make it as level as you can.

174
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,268
{\an8}<i>If everyone isn't completely focused,</i>

175
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,671
{\an8}<i>there's a risk of someone being injured.</i>

176
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:19,278
Right. I see.

177
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:22,481
You float up. You have to resist it.

178
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,651
So, you have to make sure
your weight's on it properly.

179
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:32,091
<i>Until now, it was Snow Man
who lifted Takizawa up.</i>

180
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:35,928
<i>It was their utmost concern
to support him so he wouldn't get hurt.</i>

181
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:38,330
<i>Which is exactly why this happens.</i>

182
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,699
Say if it slips.

183
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,368
-Higher.
-Line the corners up.

184
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:44,136
That looks a little off.

185
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:48,140
You fix it. Quickly!

186
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:51,477
If you mess up, it will be
the person on top who gets hurt.

187
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,445
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

188
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,815
Think about what's at stake, everyone.

189
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,416
It's really irresponsible.

190
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:59,585
-You raised your voice there.
-Really?

191
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:04,123
It's only because I understand the danger.
You have to do things properly.

192
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:07,059
One slip in concentration
means a real injury.

193
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,329
I believe you should
let people know if something

194
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,865
is good or bad
whether they're your junior or senior.

195
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:15,601
You have to
if you want to make things better.

196
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:19,071
You don't know these things
unless you're told.

197
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,109
"Oh, so that's how you do it."
I want people to think that.

198
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:27,413
Shut your damn mouths!
I've got nothing to say to...

199
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,183
<i>And then something happens
that same day as they rehearse a scene.</i>

200
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:35,588
<i>One of the performers
is called out for not focusing.</i>

201
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:41,460
It's the perfect time
to see Kanda River. This way!

202
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:44,363
{\an8}SEIJI TANAKA

203
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,866
{\an8}<i>It's Seiji Tanaka from Johnny's Jr..</i>

204
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,502
{\an8}<i>He was chosen to be part of the main cast.</i>

205
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:55,708
You're a little switched off
all the time, Seiji.

206
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:58,878
Always be aware of the fact you're acting.

207
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:03,549
Even when you don't have lines, listen
to those who do and come up with your own.

208
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:11,624
<i>Break time. The first person to go
and talk to Tanaka is Sakuma.</i>

209
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:17,363
Evil must not be allowed
to go on spreading unchecked.

210
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:20,699
Your voice is still far too weak.

211
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:23,335
There are members
of the audience all the way back.

212
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:27,807
They need to hear you clearly.
They paid for their tickets, too.

213
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:32,144
I want to make this world a just one.

214
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:33,946
Louder.

215
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,416
I want to make this world a just one.

216
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:40,419
Say it so I can hear you.

217
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:45,457
I want to make this world a just one.

218
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:46,659
No, I can't hear you.

219
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:50,162
Evil must not...

220
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:53,699
Evil must not be allowed
to go on spreading unchecked.

221
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:57,703
Evil must not be allowed
to go on spreading unchecked.

222
00:13:58,437 --> 00:13:59,471
From here more.

223
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:03,909
They can only hear you over here.

224
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:05,711
They can't hear you back there.

225
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,347
Always be conscious
of the people at the back.

226
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:21,393
You're on the main cast.

227
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:24,697
The Kansai Johnny's Jr.
are outperforming you right now.

228
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,969
<i>I'm sure Seiji has an ideal
that he aspires to,</i>

229
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:35,040
<i>but there was something
he just couldn't express at all,</i>

230
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:37,977
<i>and he still didn't get it
when it was said to him gently.</i>

231
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,913
<i>So, I had to take
a slightly stronger tone with him.</i>

232
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:43,849
<i>"If you keep trying harder, you can do it.</i>

233
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,252
<i>I did it, so you can too."</i>

234
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:49,755
<i>You should always think like that
when dealing with your juniors.</i>

235
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,459
Be more aware of the danger yourself.

236
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:55,861
Because it's not
good enough at all right now.

237
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:58,464
You can't give an audience that.

238
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:02,735
It's your own responsibility to come up
with something you can give the audience.

239
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:05,671
Bang, in one.

240
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:09,241
<i>They've been down this path themselves.</i>

241
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:12,378
Louder.

242
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:18,217
<i>That's why these sentiments
are passed down to the next generation.</i>

243
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:25,624
MAY 3, 2012
SNOW MAN FORM

244
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:30,095
<i>Snow Man officially became a unit
seven years ago.</i>

245
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:35,401
<i>Since then, they've performed
in every</i> Takizawa Kabuki.

246
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:39,838
<i>It's also been
a learning opportunity for them.</i>

247
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:45,744
<i>The biggest lesson Sakuma received
from Takizawa</i>

248
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:48,781
<i>was about letting the audience
feel your passion.</i>

249
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:52,618
There's lots of new ones out!

250
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:57,156
<i>The value of an artist's passion</i>

251
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:02,061
<i>is something Sakuma notices
especially in manga and anime.</i>

252
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:05,764
This is good. It's cute.

253
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,733
Here it is!

254
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:15,307
{\an8}It's a manga called
<i>Koi Wo Shiranai Bokutachi Wa</i>.

255
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:17,476
{\an8}I really like this.

256
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:19,411
I read <i>shoujo</i> manga.

257
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:24,583
I don't think I have part four!
I'll get it.

258
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:26,919
I could talk about this forever.

259
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:32,858
<i>Anime and manga make a complete
and thorough effort to entertain the fans.</i>

260
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,829
<i>Sakuma feels a link between this
and his own work.</i>

261
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:45,704
The artists don't cut any corners, and put
their hearts and souls into their work.

262
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:49,575
That quality
really makes you feel something.

263
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:56,048
They're pieces of art that are made
by lots of people working together.

264
00:16:56,849 --> 00:17:01,987
That really resonates with me
as I think about the Johnny's shows.

265
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:06,125
If someone isn't picking up the slack,

266
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,360
it really doesn't sit well with me.

267
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:14,400
If you're not constantly giving more
than 100 percent onstage,

268
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,504
I don't think you can stir
people's emotions.

269
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:24,109
<i>So, in the end,</i>

270
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:28,714
<i>will they be able to create a show
that will stir emotions?</i>

271
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:37,923
<i>Their three weeks of training in Tokyo
are now drawing to a close.</i>

272
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:47,900
<i>January 31st.</i>

273
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,135
{\an8}<i>They arrive at a rainy Kyoto.</i>

274
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:52,004
{\an8}KYOTO SHIJO MINAMIZA THEATRE

275
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:55,507
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

276
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:56,942
Good morning!

277
00:17:58,177 --> 00:17:59,211
Here we go.

278
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,848
The drums are all set up.

279
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:07,319
<i>There are three days until the show.</i>

280
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:10,189
<i>They need to hurry to finish
the final touches.</i>

281
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:12,157
Good work! See you, then!

282
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:19,765
I've left the box here, Sakuma.

283
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:27,206
<i>The first thing Snow Man do after arriving
in Kyoto is set up their dressing rooms.</i>

284
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:36,115
<i>For the next month, this is home.</i>

285
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:40,219
Time to start making my dressing room.

286
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:44,590
{\an8}<i>The most fastidious band member</i>

287
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:48,227
{\an8}<i>when it comes to dressing rooms
is Watanabe.</i>

288
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:53,966
This is... What do you call this again?
Do you know?

289
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:58,237
I hate it being here or facing this way.

290
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:04,243
I want the logo to be facing out
nice and neatly.

291
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:07,246
<i>It seems he's the very organized type.</i>

292
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:13,185
This is the new member of the crew.
Dermatologists use it.

293
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:18,056
I sometimes bring things
they use in hospitals, too.

294
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:22,161
<i>It's to make sure his skin
isn't dried out by the makeup.</i>

295
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:26,265
I can't help but enjoy finding a place
for everything to go.

296
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:35,040
<i>He has so many cosmetics because of
something he feels strongly as an idol.</i>

297
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:44,783
Everyone has beautiful faces,
beautiful skin.

298
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:48,654
Beautiful hair.
A cool haircut and stylish clothes.

299
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:52,057
That's what people dream of.

300
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:56,762
They expect that when they come to see us.

301
00:19:56,995 --> 00:20:00,666
So, before worrying about my personality,

302
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:05,304
my top priority is to look immaculate.

303
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:09,541
As if I'm glittering.
I like to take that seriously.

304
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:12,110
Looking to the future,

305
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:17,583
I'd like people to see me
as the strong vocalist of Snow Man.

306
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,852
That's an accolade I aspire to.

307
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:24,957
I'm aiming to be in that spot.

308
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:32,864
<i>So that each of the boys' unique
characteristics can shine in the show,</i>

309
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:35,434
<i>the different parts have been
carefully mapped out.</i>

310
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:40,539
{\an8}TAIKO

311
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:43,842
{\an8}<i>A display of remarkable strength,
the taiko.</i>

312
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,581
{\an8}<i>TAKIZAWA KABUKI</i> SAKURA NO MAI DANCE

313
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:51,583
{\an8}<i>A bewitching dance, portraying women.</i>

314
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,754
{\an8}Thank you ever so much!

315
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:58,690
{\an8}<i>There are comedic parts, too.</i>

316
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:04,329
<i>Watanabe, who hopes to be
the unit's main vocalist,</i>

317
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,398
<i>has one solo performance.</i>

318
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:14,273
{\an8}BALLAD "MY FRIEND"

319
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:24,616
{\an8}SWORD FIGHT (MONOCHROME)

320
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:28,720
{\an8}<i>And doing battle in this fight scene
is Miyadate.</i>

321
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:33,191
<i>His search to find something
only he can do brought him here.</i>

322
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:37,195
{\an8}SHOCHIKU FILM SET, KYOTO

323
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:39,264
{\an8}<i>They have a moment's rest in Kyoto.</i>

324
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:42,934
{\an8}<i>Time to soak in the atmosphere
on the set of a period piece.</i>

325
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:48,540
<i>If they don't fall completely
in love with this world,</i>

326
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:51,543
<i>the passion they need to move people
just won't be there.</i>

327
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:57,015
QUESTION: HOW DO YOU PREPARE
TO ENTERTAIN PEOPLE?

328
00:21:57,082 --> 00:22:02,921
I think it comes down to the question
of if you can influence people or not.

329
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:08,460
They might like your face,
the way you dance or your voice.

330
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:11,163
That's all well and good.

331
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:15,667
But can you, this person they like,
influence people or can't you?

332
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:19,905
Will they work hard so they can see you?

333
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,909
Will they spend their hard-earned cash
to come to your concert?

334
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:25,677
To see your show?

335
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:30,048
I want to be an idol

336
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,785
who gets people to do that.

337
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:39,424
I chose to follow this path in life,

338
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,694
so I absolutely don't want
to cut any corners.

339
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:46,331
I want to see it all the way through.

340
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:50,969
Being a part of Johnny's,
and the idol Ryota Miyadate.

341
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:57,275
And I want people to see Ryota Miyadate
growing as an actor in a historical drama.

342
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:02,080
{\an8}FEBRUARY 3
THE DAY OF THE OPENING PERFORMANCE

343
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:09,755
<i>At long last,
the time has come for Snow Man.</i>

344
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:19,030
{\an8}<i>On the</i> Ride On Time <i>finale...</i>

345
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:20,599
{\an8}Why am I doing a fake smile?

346
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:23,702
{\an8}<i>With the show imminent,</i>

347
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:27,005
{\an8}<i>the process of trial and error
goes right up the last minute.</i>

348
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,174
{\an8}The collar won't stay up on this side.

349
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:32,978
{\an8}<i>It's a race against time to rehearse.</i>

350
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:36,748
{\an8}<i>Offstage, it is like a war zone.</i>

351
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:38,784
{\an8}My wig!

352
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:40,152
{\an8}My wig!

353
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,788
{\an8}We're wasting time.

354
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:46,792
{\an8}<i>And an accident befalls Iwamoto.</i>

355
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:49,294
{\an8}Now I've gone and done it.

356
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:53,665
{\an8}<i>The first performance is finally here.</i>

357
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:59,237
<i>What will they obtain from this
incredible opportunity of a show?</i>

358
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:01,907
