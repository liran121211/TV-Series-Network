<i>August 31st.</i>

00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:14,247
<i>The first day of Hey! Say! JUMP's
concert tour is about to begin.</i>

4
00:00:14,647 --> 00:00:16,316
-Did everyone stretch?
-First day!

5
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:18,151
Yes, we did.

6
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:21,388
Channel your nerves into energy.

7
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:23,089
Be careful not to injure yourself.

8
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:24,057
That's right.

9
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:25,759
-Okay.
-Keep control.

10
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:26,659
Right!

11
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:27,827
Let's go.

12
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:28,995
All right!

13
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:35,802
<i>Four youths are nervously
watching over the members.</i>

14
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:38,071
<i>They've faced many challenges</i>

15
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:40,040
<i>while working toward this day.</i>

16
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:43,343
-Hey.
-Yes.

17
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,512
-Come here.
-Yes, sir.

18
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:49,015
I feel like I could've done more.

19
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,384
But it's difficult.

20
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,953
I'm constantly exhausted.

21
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:58,792
I'm anxious and not sure what to do.
I'm very worried.

22
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:00,960
It's spilling.

23
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:03,797
There's been some trouble,

24
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,198
which has set us back.

25
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:09,502
I've never been this nervous before.

26
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:14,974
<i>This is a story of youths
working on the sidelines</i>

27
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,943
<i>to support the center stage.</i>

28
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:43,870
<i>This is documentary series</i> Ride On Time.

29
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:49,409
<i>It happened one evening,</i>

30
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:52,045
<i>as they were preparing for
the tour's opening day.</i>

31
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:58,885
{\an8}<i>The staff members were faced with trouble.</i>

32
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:06,025
<i>A piece of equipment that's used for
attaching lights and special effects,</i>

33
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:09,295
<i>called a rounded truss,
could not be raised up.</i>

34
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:10,830
ROUNDED TRUSS

35
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:12,732
{\an8}It might be the weight.

36
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,801
{\an8}STAGE FACILITATOR
MASAHIRO UEDA (AGE 27)

37
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:17,804
{\an8}The calculation should be correct, but...

38
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:19,939
{\an8}it's overweight and won't go up.

39
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:26,913
<i>Ueda, the rookie stage facilitator,
stands still in shock.</i>

{\an8}SPECIAL EFFECTS
MICHIRU YABE (AGE 21)

41
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:32,919
{\an8}<i>But feeling even more overwhelmed,</i>

42
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:36,055
{\an8}<i>was Yabe from the special effects team.</i>

43
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,058
-Take down two units.
-Two units?

44
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,026
Yes.

45
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:45,832
<i>The piece of equipment that had to be
taken down is called the scroller.</i>

46
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:47,634
SCROLLER

47
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:54,307
It's a device that hangs up above
and scatters gold and silver confetti.

48
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,480
<i>This scroller is what helped Yabe
to overcome setbacks</i>

49
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,017
<i>and choose this line of work.</i>

50
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:10,256
<i>Will they be able to use the scroller?</i>

51
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,899
<i>What is causing this trouble?</i>

52
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:26,673
{\an8}<i>The stage manager takes command,</i>

53
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:31,878
{\an8}<i>and they decide to take down
two of the four scrollers.</i>

54
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:36,115
<i>But...</i>

55
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:38,184
It's not working.

56
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:39,619
It stopped.

57
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,088
We took down 100 kilos.

58
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:47,560
{\an8}<i>Yabe's boss, Nikami, looks worried.</i>

{\an8}SPECIAL EFFECTS CHIEF OPERATOR
ASAKI NIKAMI

60
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:51,831
Remove them all.

61
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:52,865
<i>And then...</i>

62
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:55,868
-Special effects!
-We're taking them all down?

63
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:57,837
We'll try taking them down once.

64
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,939
<i>They will take all the scrollers down.</i>

65
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:07,480
<i>Without the scrollers,
they can't rain confetti onto the stage.</i>

66
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:11,985
<i>For Yabe, there is nothing
more disappointing than that.</i>

67
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:16,823
MICHIRU YABE

68
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:19,993
<i>Yabe learned to play the piano
at a young age,</i>

69
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:23,997
<i>and from junior high she played
the saxophone in the school band club.</i>

70
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:28,768
<i>She dreamed of a career in music.</i>

71
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:32,805
<i>But it was a competitive world...</i>

72
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:37,010
I aspired to be a musician,

73
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,712
but everyone around me was so much better

74
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,581
that I felt overwhelmed.

75
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:44,684
Becoming a professional

76
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:49,088
requires a lot of determination,

77
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:52,125
and even as a professional,

78
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:56,429
you're on your own as a solo artist.

79
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:01,134
My will alone

80
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:03,770
was not enough.

81
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:08,574
I was faced with the harsh reality
of the music business.

82
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:14,781
<i>That's when she came across a new dream.</i>

83
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:18,384
{\an8}Everybody jump.

84
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:19,385
{\an8}NATIONWIDE TOUR 2013

85
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:22,655
{\an8}<i>It was at the Hey! Say! JUMP dome concert.</i>

86
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,158
<i>The extensive stage production</i>

87
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:27,827
<i>captured her heart.</i>

88
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:37,970
It was my first year of high school,
and I tagged along with my friend

89
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:40,206
who had front row seats.

90
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:42,241
That was my very first concert.

91
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:47,113
It was unreal. I saw fire and other
special effects right in front of me.

92
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:49,982
I have to say...

93
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:52,585
the most memorable part

94
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:54,721
was when the silver streamers

95
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:57,423
came down, and everyone...

96
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,259
reached out to grab them.

97
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,031
That left a big impression on me,

98
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:10,903
and it made me want to take part in
creating something like that.

99
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:14,474
It was all I could think about
at that moment.

100
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:22,882
<i>Yabe went to vocational school,
studied stage production,</i>

101
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,017
<i>and began working at
a special effects company.</i>

102
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:34,927
<i>Will she be able to fulfill her dream
and rain confetti onto the stage?</i>

103
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:40,133
<i>Day two of setting up.</i>

104
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:43,369
SPECIAL EFFECTS

105
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:46,906
<i>When Yabe and her special effects team
arrived at the venue...</i>

106
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:54,180
<i>The structure had been raised up</i>

107
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,582
<i>with four scrollers attached to it.</i>

108
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:02,989
<i>Apparently, the motor that lifts the truss
was set at the incorrect voltage.</i>

109
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,962
{\an8}This morning they re-wired everything,
and it went up.

110
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:12,832
{\an8}I've done it three or four times now.

111
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:14,967
{\an8}SPECIAL EFFECTS CHIEF OPERATOR
ASAKI NIKAMI

112
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:19,572
<i>They feel relieved,</i>

113
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,207
<i>but there's no time to rest.</i>

114
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:24,310
Where's the Viper?

115
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:26,679
<i>To gain more responsibility,</i>

116
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:31,217
<i>she must learn to master many more
techniques and types of equipment.</i>

117
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:37,957
<i>This is a piece of equipment
called the Viper.</i>

118
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:39,258
VIPER

119
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:41,227
A Viper...

120
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:45,665
creates smoke.

121
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:49,068
What kind of smoke does it produce?

122
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,370
It's a water-based smoke.

123
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:54,807
Usually, when the artists are dancing,
this smoke covers

124
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:57,844
the surface of the stage
to create a nice atmosphere.

125
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:03,783
You can also emit a large amount of smoke
all at once to momentarily hide someone.

126
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,551
There are many ways to use it.

127
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:07,820
VIPER

128
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:09,889
<i>Various special effects</i>

129
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:14,927
<i>can either surprise an audience
or engulf them in a mystical atmosphere.</i>

130
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:23,169
<i>To create this special effect,</i>

131
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:25,872
<i>Yabe tirelessly connects
the cables together.</i>

132
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:34,146
There are pieces of equipment
that I'm using

133
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:35,448
for the very first time.

134
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:40,453
Learning about new equipment while
on the road for a long period of time,

135
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,290
can be emotionally
and physically draining.

136
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:48,794
But when I complete this tour,

137
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:53,733
I hope I'll have become more experienced.

138
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,436
{\an8}<i>Regarding the rookie,
her senior Nikami says...</i>

139
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:01,774
{\an8}Although she's a new recruit,

140
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:04,744
{\an8}she takes initiative,

141
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:07,613
{\an8}and she's very proactive.

142
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:12,118
{\an8}So as a second-year recruit,
she's doing very well.

143
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,454
{\an8}Sometimes she's absent-minded,

144
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:19,692
{\an8}but that can be resolved with
time and experience.

145
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:25,665
<i>She once dreamed of being center stage.</i>

146
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:29,135
<i>But now she faces the future
with a helmet on.</i>

147
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,838
<i>The bright world of entertainment</i>

148
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:35,575
<i>is supported by people like her.</i>

149
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:41,514
<i>There's 24 hours until rehearsal begins.</i>

150
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:45,985
{\an8}<i>Masahiro Ueda, the stage facilitator.</i>

151
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:49,689
{\an8}<i>During the tour, he's in charge of
looking after the members</i>

152
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:52,358
{\an8}<i>and managing their safety,</i>

153
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,527
{\an8}<i>but he's still a rookie
with only three months of experience.</i>

154
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,763
{\an8}<i>He studied computers in vocational school</i>

155
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:00,600
{\an8}<i>but started working here as a part-timer.</i>

156
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:05,705
<i>Eleven in the morning.</i>

157
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:07,640
<i>Ueda is below the stage,</i>

158
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:11,143
<i>setting up a quick-change room
for the Hey! Say! JUMP members.</i>

159
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:13,212
Okay.

160
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,048
If some areas are difficult to maneuver,

161
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,251
you can fold it over.

162
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:22,822
This is where the members come

163
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:25,057
for a quick costume change.

164
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:27,460
We're laying down the cover.

165
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:29,729
Can you spread it out a little more?

166
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:35,768
<i>Helping the artists, so they can perform
on stage without anxiety,</i>

167
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:39,405
<i>directly affects the quality
of the concert.</i>

{\an8}STAGE FACILITATOR
KEIKO OKABAYASHI

169
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,042
{\an8}<i>What they need is the power</i>

170
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:47,046
{\an8}<i>to discern what is required of them
in the moment.</i>

171
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:53,185
There are eight members,

172
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:55,121
but each one

173
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,789
is different in height

174
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:58,791
and body shape.

175
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:04,664
Since I'm not tall myself,
I never gave it much thought,

176
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:08,134
but there may be obstacles overhead

177
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:12,004
that could harm certain members.

178
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:16,175
So I put myself in every member's shoes
as I walk below the stage,

179
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:19,178
searching for any possible hazards.

180
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:22,314
I feel like I gave it a lot of thought

181
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:23,849
and did my best

182
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,252
in that area.

183
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:33,659
<i>Ueda and his co-worker
are having difficulty making a decision.</i>

184
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:38,497
{\an8}How high should it be? Two <i>hakoba</i>?

185
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:40,166
{\an8}HAKOBA: WOODEN BOXES USED TO
ALTER STAGE HEIGHT

186
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:42,334
{\an8}They will have to bend down
like this, right?

187
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:43,803
It's so low.

188
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:51,544
That's too obvious.

189
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:54,914
<i>They constantly think of the members.</i>

190
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:59,285
We were planning to place a basket here

191
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:02,021
where the performers can return
their glow sticks.

192
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:05,357
We're deciding on the height
of the basket.

193
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,763
<i>Why do they put so much thought
into the smallest details?</i>

194
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:12,932
<i>They're thinking of the members</i>

195
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:16,202
<i>and the compatibility
with the stage production.</i>

196
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:22,775
{\an8}<i>For example, here,</i>

197
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,344
{\an8}<i>they're singing with glow sticks,</i>

198
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:27,012
{\an8}<i>but during the interlude,</i>

199
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:29,882
<i>they place them back in the basket.</i>

200
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:31,450
Please turn off your glow sticks.

201
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:37,189
Then, when I give the signal,
turn them on starting from the front row.

202
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:40,626
{\an8}<i>If the basket is too low,
the members must bend down.</i>

203
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:42,394
{\an8}<i>But if it's too high,</i>

204
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:46,999
{\an8}<i>it becomes visible to the audience,
and will pull them back to reality.</i>

205
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:52,938
Having it higher makes it
easier to access,

206
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:55,674
yet it can't be too visible.

207
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:58,010
But it also can't burden the members.

208
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:04,083
<i>They continue experimenting.</i>

209
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:10,055
Should we get the wooden planks
and use that to adjust the height?

210
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:11,490
Okay.

211
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:14,827
Let's try adjusting the height.

212
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:16,028
Okay.

213
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:21,667
{\an8}<i>There's a saying that goes,
"God is in the details."</i>

214
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:28,874
{\an8}<i>The experienced members know that
attention to detail makes miracles happen.</i>

215
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:31,944
We need to be flexible,

216
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:36,315
since we have to make decisions
in varying circumstances.

217
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,019
That's something I need to work on,

218
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:42,388
as well as quick thinking skills,

219
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:45,357
since I can't understand things sometimes.

220
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:48,761
We need to secure the runway tracks.

221
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,564
Can you do that when you're
marking the stage?

222
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:54,200
-With the arrows?
-Yes, that's right.

223
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:55,768
Okay. I understand.

224
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:56,936
Perfect.

225
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:58,103
Let's go.

226
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,344
<i>There are many staff members</i>

227
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:09,949
<i>inside the arena who channel their passion
into this detailed work.</i>

228
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:16,088
<i>It's hard work, but they take pride in it.</i>

229
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:23,863
<i>As the time for rehearsal with
Hey! Say! JUMP nears,</i>

230
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:27,233
{\an8}SPECIAL MECHANICS
SHOICHIRO FUKUDA (AGE 24)

231
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:30,402
{\an8}<i>Shoichiro Fukuda from
the special mechanics team</i>

232
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:31,837
<i>is finalizing his work.</i>

233
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:38,477
<i>They must construct a complex stage</i>

234
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:42,081
<i>that moves up, down, and rotates around.</i>

235
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:50,589
<i>All the team members</i>

236
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:55,527
<i>begin to construct the center stage
in the middle of the arena.</i>

237
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:02,034
Right now, we're setting up

238
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:05,437
the base of the stage
called the turntable.

239
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:07,406
This causes the whole stage
to spin around.

240
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:14,713
<i>This stage is essential for this concert.</i>

241
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:16,715
<i>It spins 360 degrees,</i>

242
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:20,552
<i>allowing the audience to view
the members from all angles.</i>

243
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:25,691
We're checking to see if it spins.

244
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,260
Heavy equipment will be placed on top,

245
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:31,563
so we need to make sure the turntable
works beforehand.

246
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:33,899
Stop.

247
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:36,335
Can you spin it the other way now?

248
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:38,304
Does it look okay?

249
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,205
Yes.

250
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:45,377
To complete the turntable,
we first cover it with veneer,

251
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:48,914
and then we will start
attaching more parts to it.

252
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:58,190
<i>Eleven lifting apparatus called lifters
will be installed on the center stage.</i>

253
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:00,826
LIFTER

254
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:04,096
<i>Combining the movements of
all eleven lifters</i>

255
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:09,034
<i>creates a dynamic stage production,</i>

256
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:11,603
<i>which is a highlight
of the concert this time.</i>

257
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:16,075
It's over a ton.

258
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:19,979
Is there any way we can connect
these boards together?

259
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:28,287
<i>Each lifter weighs over a ton.</i>

260
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:32,358
<i>Fukuda was placed in charge
of the lifters.</i>

261
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:37,496
Ready, set, go.

262
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:41,233
Is it okay?

263
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:43,469
Okay, stop.

264
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:48,640
<i>Moving heavy equipment by hand
is potentially dangerous,</i>

265
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:50,476
<i>so tension is running high.</i>

266
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:53,212
Insert the bolt with the ratchet.

267
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:54,213
Okay.

268
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:57,116
We'll start with Fukuda's side.

269
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,752
Don't smash your finger.

270
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:03,055
It's your finger, not mine.

271
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:05,891
-Ready?
-Yes.

272
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:10,429
A little more.

273
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:14,833
A little more.

274
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:16,902
Okay.

275
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:20,472
<i>In college, Fukuda was studying economics.</i>

276
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:24,209
<i>But he wanted a job
where he could create something</i>

277
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,945
<i>to gain a sense of accomplishment.</i>

278
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:28,447
<i>So, he chose this career.</i>

279
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,851
I was interested in work

280
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:35,354
that's done behind the scenes.

281
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:37,956
I used to play music...

282
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:40,726
So I started searching for something

283
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:45,030
that was related to concerts
or live music performances.

284
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:46,965
That's how I started this job.

285
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:51,236
In high school I played wind instruments,
and during college I was into jazz.

286
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:57,342
Right now, I'm so busy that I have
no time to play music.

287
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:03,916
{\an8}<i>What does Fukuda's superior
think about his job performance?</i>

288
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:05,250
{\an8}SUB CHIEF OPERATOR
MASAKI YAMANAKA

289
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:06,819
{\an8}As his senior?

290
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,557
{\an8}He's a hard worker. But inexperienced.

291
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:13,692
{\an8}I want him to gain experience.

292
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:15,394
Difficulties?

293
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:18,197
What's exhausting?

294
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,532
Well, I feel like
everything is exhausting.

295
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,202
I'm constantly exhausted.

296
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:27,206
But I've never wanted to quit.
Maybe that's why I'm still here.

297
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:30,576
SOUND

298
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:34,713
<i>The sound team is finalizing
their work as well.</i>

299
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:42,521
{\an8}<i>One of the young workers is Kuramochi.</i>

300
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:44,523
Sequence is okay.

301
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:50,362
<i>This is the first time
he has been appointed as the stage chief.</i>

302
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:55,934
<i>He sets up the instruments
the members will be using</i>

303
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:58,937
<i>and passes the microphones during
the concert.</i>

304
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:00,973
<i>This job doesn't allow room for error.</i>

305
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:05,310
I used to play instruments

306
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:09,081
and was also in a band club
a long time ago.

307
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:13,685
I liked playing instruments,

308
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:17,156
but I was more fascinated with
the sound itself.

309
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:18,423
It amazed me

310
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:22,494
how sound has the ability
to stir up emotions.

311
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:25,898
I was wondering if there
was a job that would

312
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:28,534
allow me to do what I like,
and work with sound.

313
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,570
That's when I came across this job

314
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:34,006
as a sound technician for concerts.

315
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:36,975
That's why I chose this job.

316
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:43,582
<i>Under the stage, Kuramochi started</i>

317
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:46,084
<i>a meeting with the stage facilitator team.</i>

318
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,288
This is the quick changing area?

319
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:50,189
Yes.

320
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:51,990
The areas with fluorescent lights.

321
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:53,792
Is that okay?

322
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,227
Absolutely.

323
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:57,396
Over here...

324
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:01,333
<i>He's searching for a place to hold
the sound equipment</i>

325
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,035
<i>that'll be used during the concert.</i>

326
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:07,906
<i>With quick-change rooms set up,
space under the stage is limited,</i>

327
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,777
<i>so he must plan out his course
with the stage facilitation team.</i>

328
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:15,080
She's from the stage facilitation team,

329
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:17,783
so she knows the entire set up,

330
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:20,419
and makes sure everything runs smoothly.

331
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:23,722
We would ask her
where things can be set up,

332
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:27,259
or when we need an extra hand,

333
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:29,728
we'd ask her to send us a helper.
That's the process.

334
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:33,065
We can't do anything without that team.

335
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,037
<i>Teamwork is what makes a concert happen.</i>

336
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:40,038
TEAMWORK

337
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:43,675
<i>That's why each team strives
for perfection.</i>

338
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:48,413
<i>That is how the venue is constructed.</i>

339
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:54,820
<i>They conduct final adjustments
right up until the very last minute.</i>

340
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:02,828
<i>Even though these four youths
are inexperienced,</i>

341
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:06,198
<i>they're still expected
to work like professionals.</i>

342
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:13,372
I'm nervous. I have to do what I can.

343
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:16,875
<i>Starting tomorrow,</i>

344
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:20,812

00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:31,156
{\an8}<i>The members of Hey! Say! JUMP
are going to arrive for rehearsal.</i>

348
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:33,425
{\an8}<i>During this one practice,</i>

349
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:36,662
{\an8}<i>they must verify the entire flow
of the concert.</i>

350
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:41,767
Once the members arrive,

351
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:45,504
and they grasp
the general flow of the concert,

352
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:48,140
we will do a dress rehearsal

353
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:50,942
and run through the entire program
like it's the actual show.

354
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:55,914
So today is the day when
a lot of things will be set in stone,

355
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,950
and a lot of things that were
already set will change too.

356
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:04,189
So it will actually be a lot busier
than the day of the actual concert.

357
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:06,491
That's how it is.

358
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:11,563
I don't have a clear picture
of the end result,

359
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:16,234
so we'll make adjustments
once it's all set in place.

360
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:18,337
Yesterday,

361
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,440
the lifter had some technical issues,

362
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:25,243
but we were able to fix that today
and now it's working well,

363
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,411
so everything is okay.

364
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,714
Everything is last minute.

365
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:32,117
We don't have a lot of time left.

366
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,655
We're in a rush.

367
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:47,566
<i>Although these four youths have
different job descriptions and positions,</i>

368
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,267
<i>they have the same goal.</i>

369
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:53,138
<i>They want to provide a great concert
for the audience.</i>

370
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:55,507
<i>That's their one wish.</i>

371
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:04,750
<i>It's 1:30 p.m.</i>

372
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:08,520
<i>The members of
Hey! Say! JUMP have arrived.</i>

373
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:15,160
Good morning, Hey! Say! JUMP.

374
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,228
Good morning.

375
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:17,429
Nice to meet you.

376
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:19,264
This is the rehearsal for

377
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:22,167
the first day of the 2018 tour
in Musashino Arena.

378
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,269
Let's all work hard.

379
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,941
{\an8}<i>The countdown to
the main event won't stop.</i>

380
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:33,512
{\an8}<i>There's one more day
until the first day of the concert.</i>

381
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:38,750
{\an8}I create situations that I know
people will want to take pictures of.

382
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:39,985
{\an8}It's kindness.

383
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:41,753
{\an8}It's rather difficult.

384
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,155
{\an8}Today?

385
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:45,590
{\an8}I'm just simply tired.

386
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:48,427
{\an8}<i>On the next</i> Ride On Time<i>,</i>

387
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:50,362
{\an8}<i>the rehearsal officially begins.</i>

388
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:55,133
{\an8}<i>The four young concert staff members
face an emergency situation.</i>

389
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:59,738
<i>Will they be able to welcome
the opening day with a smile?</i>

390
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:01,807
