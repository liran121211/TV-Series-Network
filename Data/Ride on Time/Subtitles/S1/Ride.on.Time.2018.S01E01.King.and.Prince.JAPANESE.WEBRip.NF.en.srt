00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:06,606
But we really aren't.

176
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:09,842
I'm serious.

177
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:15,514
<i>Hirano as a young boy.</i>

178
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,418
<i>In second grade, he took up dancing,</i>

179
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,787
<i>which paved the way for his career.</i>

180
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:25,024
I've been shy ever since I was young.

181
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:29,061
I would cry every time
we had singing recitals at school.

182
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:32,198
Going out in front of everyone
wasn't my thing.

183
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:34,233
I'm still like that now.

184
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:40,539
<i>How did such a boy find his way here?</i>

185
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:47,146
I wonder.

186
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:52,918
I think the main reason why
I was working hard

187
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,621
was for my mother.

188
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:59,125
I was raised by a single mother.

189
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,827
My mother almost died once.

190
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:04,130
Frankly speaking,

191
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:08,901
being an idol is a job.

192
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:12,838
I would see my friends getting married,

193
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:16,676
working at their jobs,
supporting their families,

194
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:18,778
and being very "human" in a way.

195
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:25,484
I felt like that was what you had to do
as a human being.

196
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:31,991
I didn't want to make my mother sad,

197
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:36,162
so I felt like I had to
work hard at my job.

<i>He doesn't put up a facade

204
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:55,247
Look at how I walk.
I look like an old man.

205
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:01,887
An idol shouldn't be
walking like this, actually.

206
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,557
I should be walking like this.

207
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:06,792
But this is how I walk.

208
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,663
When I was filming the drama,
a staff member told me that

209
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,366
because I didn't act like a typical idol,

210
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:16,435
they felt an affinity with me.

211
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:19,805
I was told often
that they felt closer to me

212
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:23,709
because I would show them my real self.

213
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:26,712
If I were to put up a facade,

214
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:32,218
the fans I would gain
would only like me through a filter.

215
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:33,519
So...

216
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:38,023
I don't want to lie to them.

217
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:43,696
I want people to like me
for who I am naturally,

218
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,965
which is why I act this way.

219
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,034
Excuse me.

220
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:55,508

Hirano say something unexpected...</i>

221
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,576

226

00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:16,896
Thank you!

228
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:22,201
<i>Compared to other groups,
they may not have debuted very quickly,</i>

229
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:24,837
<i>but they've been through it all together</i>

230
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:27,139
<i>and have a strong bond.</i>

231
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:38,217
<i>The members wish to see the group grow
and share a common idea.</i>

232
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:45,891
<i>Each of them wants to find something
that only they can do.</i>

233
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:46,792
It's too much.

234
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:50,029
Now that we're a group,

235
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,964
I think about what I can do

236
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:54,667
and what kind of effect
it will have on the group.

237
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:59,572
I want to be able to contribute
positive things to the group.

238
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,274
In doing so,

239
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:06,545
I want to become one of the many
who support this group.

242
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:14,053

00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:35,641
<i>Takahashi has liked to draw
since childhood</i>

248
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,811

252
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,588
A lot of it is unfinished.

253
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:54,126
<i>This day, he was working to complete
what they call a "name,"</i>

254
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:57,263
<i>which is somewhat like a script for manga.</i>

255
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:03,035
<i>He's writing a romantic comedy

256
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:06,272
I don't know if I'll make it.

<i>He uses the time in between

<i>so inevitably time is limited.</i>

259
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:18,450
<i>And of course, he must get it
checked by the editor.</i>

260
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:22,154
At first, you can't tell if this person is
in junior high or high school.

261
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:23,155
I see.

262
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:26,492
I don't think you know
how to go about drawing this.

263
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:30,162
-Yes.
-So, we'll talk about how to do that.

264
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:34,099
My brain isn't functioning.

265
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,069
My brain isn't functioning.

266
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:41,607
Seriously,
my brain is using up all my sugar.

267
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:43,208
This one.

268
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:46,111
<i>Another issue is how he will draw</i>

269
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:48,213
<i>the most important</i> "kabe-don" <i>scene.</i>

270
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:54,453
There was a reference book
with a collection of <i>kabe-don</i> poses.

271
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:56,889
Instead of drawing it
without any reference,

272
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,657
if you are unsure about the poses,

273
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:02,328
it may be better to use these as a guide.

274
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:04,930
<i>Even for just one</i> kabe-don <i>scene,</i>

275
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:06,899
<i>there are endless possibilities.</i>

276
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:12,104
<i>By this point, he is already worn out.</i>

277
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,776
-Did you have the day off yesterday?
-Yesterday? Yes.

278
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:20,145
What did you do?

279
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:23,248
I literally slept until the evening.

280
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:29,688
But you know how we have
a set schedule like this every day?

281
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:32,858
So, even when I get a day off,

282
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:35,060
I don't know if I should rest all day

283
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:37,663
or make the most of it.

284
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:42,401
I want my manager to tell me
what to do on my days off too.

285
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:51,076
<i>As a child,
Takahashi lacked self-confidence</i>

286
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,545
<i>and always cared about others' opinions.</i>

287
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:55,848
<i>He was not good at sports either.</i>

288
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,685
<i>The one thing he was confident in
was dancing.</i>

289
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:06,091
<i>He joined the agency
under the encouragement of his mother.</i>

290
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:08,861
<i>But even during his time as a Johnny's Jr.</i>

291
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,363
<i>he was unsure of what he could contribute</i>

292
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,298
<i>and was filled with anxiety.</i>

293
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:18,470
<i>Even when they debuted...</i>

294
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:23,208
Generally, I just don't have
a lot of self-confidence.

295
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:27,413
It was decided in January,
and we actually debuted in May.

296
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:32,484
I went back home and thought about it

297
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,921
but thinking about my future
made me so scared.

298
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:39,925
I had my head on my pillow the whole time,

299
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,094
and I was thinking.

300
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:46,498
I don't know what triggered it,
but tears just began to stream down.

301
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:50,002
And in the end,

302
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,405
I fell asleep not knowing
what exactly was making me anxious.

303
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:56,241
That continued every day
for about three or four months.

304
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:59,645
I think I used up
a lifetime's worth of tears.

305
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:04,216
Maybe I felt pressured
from having to go out into the world.

306
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:08,987
The fact that I debuted
was a cause for joy,

307
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:10,489
but I was worried about

308
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:14,660
whether I could handle all the pressure
that would come as a result.

309
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:17,963
I was worried the whole time.

310
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:23,769
<i>Those days would not go to waste.</i>

311
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:27,539
There's nothing here.

312
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:31,243
<i>After this, a member

313
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:34,046
Nagoya!

314
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:39,751
<i>He unveils all of his hidden thoughts.</i>

315
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,921
I wanted to quit.

316
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:45,824
I wanted to just quit and go away.

317
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:51,597
{\an8}<i>This day, Hirano,
the face of King & Prince,</i>

318
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:52,731

319
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:53,632
{\an8}NAGOYA, AICHI

320
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:55,501
There's really nothing.

321
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:00,873
It's very calming, though.

322
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,175
I love Nagoya, after all.

323
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:07,513
I used to like to lay out tarp
around these type of places

324
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,548
and eat rice balls.

325
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:11,350
In elementary school?

326
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,485
No, I was totally a third-year
junior high student.

327
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:19,358
There was nothing around my hometown.

328
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:21,426
Nowhere to play.

329
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,529
I spent my youth doing random―

330
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:24,997
That's a huge grasshopper!

331
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,167
-That scared me.
-You don't like bugs?

332
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:30,035
Now, I don't like bugs.

333
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:35,307
I used to live in this kind of place,
so bugs used to be so normal to me.

334
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:38,110
But after I moved to Tokyo,
I lost touch with bugs.

335
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:42,447
Now there's a wall between bugs and me.

336
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:47,719
<i>His peaceful hometown.</i>

337
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:51,757
There's nothing here.

338
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:56,695
<i>He moved to Tokyo
when he was 18 years old.</i>

339
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:01,733
I was so desperate at the time.
I was like, "Tokyo?!"

340
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:04,636
I wasn't sure, but I decided to go.

341
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:09,708
Honestly, I only knew of it
as a world on TV.

342
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:13,745
I never thought I'd go
from this riverside to Tokyo.

343
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:18,750
A boy who was picking
four-leaf clovers over there

344
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:21,220
is on stage in Tokyo now.

345
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:25,290
Even now, when I'm on stage

346
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,392
it feels strange.

347
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,598
<i>And he opens up to us.</i>

348
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:35,267
By the way,

349
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:38,337
was there anything else you wanted to be
other than an idol?

350
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,671
So many things.

351
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:43,008
First, a dance instructor,

352
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:45,811
then a preschool teacher,

353
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,512
and an animal keeper.

354
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,649
-You like animals?
-I love animals too.

355
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:54,786
There are lots of jobs I'd like to try.

356
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:57,356
Last year I wanted to quit.

357
00:20:57,623 --> 00:20:59,424
I wanted to just quit and go away.

358
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:05,230
I told people in the agency
that I was thinking of quitting that year.

359
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:07,499
I was in a commercial,

360
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:11,003
so I was thinking of quitting

361
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:15,641
when the contract
for the commercial ended.

362
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:21,146
But the people at the agency said
something really nice that stopped me.

363
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:23,282
They told me that people

364
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:27,753
who see us on TV, or in magazines,
or at concerts

365
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:32,491
can be emotionally uplifted
and motivated to live another day.

366
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:36,094
And there really have been fans like that.

367
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:38,864
A lot of people have told me

368
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:41,767
that I lifted their spirits

369
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:44,436
or moved them to do their best in school.

370
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:49,274
But recently,
I've lost a lot of people I know,

371
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:53,178
like among my relatives
and a friend of mine last year.

372
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,882
So many have died.

373
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:03,822
That's why, at the end of concerts,
I often say, "Don't die."

374
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:07,426
Even if we couldn't make eye contact
at the concert,

375
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:10,862
I want everyone who is watching me
and who is connected with me

376
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:12,798
to stay alive.

377
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:14,366
I really do.

378
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:18,503
The reason I'm continuing this job
is because I want to

379
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:23,308
lift everyone's spirits.

380
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:28,914
<i>And that's why King & Prince exists now.</i>

381
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:34,453
{\an8}<i>On the next</i> Ride On Time<i>...</i>

382
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,290
{\an8}<i>The bitter experience
all six members went through.</i>

383
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,659
{\an8}What is adolescence, anyway?

384
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:43,128
{\an8}This feels really strange.

385
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:49,067
{\an8}<i>Unforgettable pasts.</i>

386
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:52,270
{\an8}That really shocked me.

387
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,006
{\an8}<i>A reunion with friends.</i>

388
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:56,775
{\an8}Okay, I'll be waiting.

389
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:01,146
{\an8}<i>Working toward their big performance.</i>

390
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,549
{\an8}The third day at Yokohama Arena
was amazing.

391
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:08,620
All I'm thinking about these days
is how to surpass that

392
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,389
as a group.

393
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:11,857
