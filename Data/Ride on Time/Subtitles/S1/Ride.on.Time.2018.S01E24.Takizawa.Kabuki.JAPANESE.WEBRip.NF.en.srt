1
00:00:01,534 --> 00:00:04,938
STAND UP ON YOUR OWN TWO FEET

2
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:09,075
<i>Here they are again,</i>

3
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:11,845
<i>working as hard as they can
to achieve their dreams.</i>

4
00:00:15,615 --> 00:00:18,618
{\an8}<i>The new stars of the idol world, Snow Man.</i>

5
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:21,688
{\an8}JOHNNY'S JR. UNIT
SNOW MAN

6
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:26,192
{\an8}<i>And the dream show they're taking on
is called</i> Takizawa Kabuki ZERO.

7
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:29,696
{\an8}<i>Their first performance is
within touching distance.</i>

8
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:55,155
<i>This is documentary series</i> Ride On Time.

9
00:00:57,757 --> 00:01:03,663
{\an8}<i>Snow Man, a unit whose athleticism
stands out even among Johnny's Jr. groups.</i>

10
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,234
{\an8}<i>They've been together seven years.</i>

11
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:11,204
{\an8}<i>At long last an enormous chance
is within their grasp</i>

12
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:14,240
{\an8}<i>in the form of taking the lead roles
in</i> Takizawa Kabuki ZERO.

13
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:20,513
{\an8}I hope to take the audience into the world
of ultimate Japanese entertainment.

14
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:24,117
{\an8}<i>As part of a plan to give the unit
a power-up,</i>

15
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:27,687
<i>Snow Man's members grew in number
from six to nine.</i>

16
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,089
THREE NEW MEMBERS JOIN

17
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:32,692
Takizawa-kun!

18
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:37,530
<i>However,</i> Takizawa Kabuki <i>has been
a high mountain to scale.</i>

19
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:42,702
<i>There are countless things
they must learn.</i>

20
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,072
The lower your shoulders,
the prettier you look.

21
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:49,876
<i>It involves some danger, too.</i>

22
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:53,546
If you mess up, it will be
the person on top who gets hurt.

23
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:54,747
Louder.

24
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:58,218
I want to make this world a just one.

25
00:01:58,518 --> 00:01:59,552
No, I can't hear you.

26
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:02,255
There are members
of the audience all the way back.

27
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,792
<i>They want it to be a success
no matter what.</i>

28
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:08,862
<i>Snow Man has just one wish.</i>

29
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,699
{\an8}I want to overcome being unknown.

30
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:14,701
{\an8}I want people to know who we are.

31
00:02:15,768 --> 00:02:19,839
{\an8}<i>The curtain on the first show will open
in the birthplace of Kabuki, Kyoto,</i>

32
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:22,075
{\an8}<i>at the legendary Minamiza Theatre.</i>

33
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:28,481
{\an8}<i>Finally, the time for battle is upon them.</i>

34
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:34,921
The collar won't stay up on this side.

35
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,991
I want to get rid of the one-piece look.

36
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:45,732
{\an8}<i>First, it's costume fitting. Miyadate
is now in charge of all the costumes.</i>

37
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:48,001
{\an8}RYOTA MIYADATE (AGE 26)

38
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:50,537
Reduce the fringe for now.

39
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:57,810
<i>In order to become more independent,
Snow Man have taken over for Takizawa,</i>

40
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:00,413
<i>and have to make their own decisions.</i>

41
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:05,718
The dances are very intricate,
so how should they look?

42
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:11,191
I want it to be fresh,
with a bit of a poppy feeling to it.

43
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:13,293
I can't wait.

44
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:19,532
<i>Next, it's a hurdle they'll have to
manage to overcome somehow.</i>

45
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:21,267
<i>The Kabuki makeup.</i>

46
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,272
<i>It's done in between
two parts of the show,</i>

47
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:29,042
<i>meaning they only have
eight minutes to apply it.</i>

48
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:34,414
<i>The kumadori makeup that takes
the longest to apply</i>

49
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,849
<i>requires some highly complicated work.</i>

50
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:41,421
I have numbers to tell me the order
to draw the lines in.

51
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:44,057
There are 16 strokes just for red.

52
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,460
And there are five for black.

53
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,830
It's a little under 30 steps in total.

54
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:56,069
<i>Will everyone be able to finish
within the eight minutes on the night?</i>

55
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,905
No way can I do this.

56
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:01,441
My eye's stinging!

57
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:03,743
I got it in my eye!

58
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:08,114
<i>Mistakes can't be redone.</i>

59
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:10,116
<i>It must be right first time.</i>

60
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,152
Okay, all done.

61
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,587
<i>How have they done?</i>

62
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:16,589
Let's call that 12 minutes.

63
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,892
<i>12 minutes just isn't quick enough.</i>

64
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:26,132
<i>They remove their makeup
and try to beat the clock again.</i>

65
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,771
Your current time isn't practical.

66
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:34,440
-More urgency, please.
-Yes, sir.

67
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,909
Three times quicker than last time, maybe?

68
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,611
-Yes, sir.
-Got it.

69
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:40,113
You can definitely do it.

70
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:45,218
<i>The band members
have all tensed up at once.</i>

71
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:48,388
Okay, start.

72
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:57,897
You've had five minutes now.

73
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,400
-Done, Iwamoto?
-Yes.

74
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:05,138
<i>It's a big reduction in time.</i>

75
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:08,808
Fukazawa done.

76
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,643
Do you want to hear your times?

77
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:16,215
Iwamoto, for example, has gone from
six minutes to a time of 2:37.

78
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,918
-You've cut it down.
-Thank you.

79
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,186
Thank you.

80
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,688
You, too, Fukka.

81
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:24,524
You've gone from 6:52 to 2:37.

82
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:27,927
-I hope that's good enough.
-You can do it. That's how it is.

83
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,295
Try and you will succeed.

84
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:32,999
If you don't practice this,
it's all pointless.

85
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,200
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

86
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:40,073
<i>They'll have to do it with even more
pressure on them when it's the show.</i>

87
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,576
This is really difficult.

88
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:50,950
<i>Trouble strikes when they begin
onstage rehearsals.</i>

89
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:57,590
<i>In the second scene of the show,
Iwamoto plays an Edo-period detective.</i>

90
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:01,094
When I do the pose
after I go up, I face this way.

91
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:06,699
<i>The highlight of the scene comes
when he poses at the top of a ladder.</i>

92
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,203
-Dropping you down now.
-Okay.

93
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:18,711
-That was close!
-Are you okay?

94
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:20,012
I'm fine.

95
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:26,252
<i>Everyone thought it was just a slip.</i>

96
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,723
<i>But he's hurt his shin badly.</i>

97
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:33,760
You've scraped the skin off.

98
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,497
We'll disinfect it.

99
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,833
I don't want to be injured!

100
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:44,170
You've taken quite a chunk out.

101
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,642
-Here it comes.
-Right.

102
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,079
<i>With the opening night imminent,</i>

103
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:57,784
<i>he seems to be angry at himself
for getting hurt.</i>

104
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:01,888
Now I've gone and done it.

105
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:03,689
Come on, man.

106
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:08,961
I've been getting injured too much lately.

107
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:12,498
The pain doesn't bother me.

108
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,335
I just wonder what the hell I'm doing.

109
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,309
<i>It's at this moment</i>

110
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:29,048
<i>that one of the new members,
Meguro, turns up.</i>

111
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:34,053
Don't you think that guys like us

112
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,056
-look cuter if we have a wound?
-Well...

113
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:40,026
isn't this more of a hindrance?

114
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:45,832
-Will you be all right?
-Of course.

115
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:47,667
I'm just letting it dry.

116
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:49,936
Sure.

117
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:55,575
<i>This is Snow Man's
long-awaited big chance.</i>

118
00:07:56,242 --> 00:08:00,213
<i>No matter what happens, if they don't
stand on the stage with their own strength</i>

119
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:02,415
<i>they'll have lost their tomorrow.</i>

120
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:07,820
<i>It looks like Iwamoto's determination
is as steely as ever.</i>

121
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:12,725
FEBRUARY 2, 2019

122
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,460
<i>It's the day before the show.</i>

123
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:20,600
<i>A press conference is being held
on the stage.</i>

124
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:28,841
<i>This is what they had to say
to the crowd of reporters.</i>

125
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:32,512
I hope to seize all opportunities

126
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:36,849
and show lots of people and all the fans
how Snow Man is charging

127
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:40,620
full steam ahead into our new era.

128
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:45,157
I believe there's a reason why
we were trusted to be at the forefront

129
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:49,161
of <i>Takizawa Kabuki ZERO</i>,
and we'll prove it.

130
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,732
Oh, man.
It's our first full dress rehearsal.

131
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,167
I'm getting nervous now.

132
00:08:56,969 --> 00:09:00,740
<i>They'll be going through the whole show
in one go, wearing their costumes.</i>

133
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:04,677
Curtain up.

134
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:08,781
<i>They've been through each part thoroughly,</i>

135
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:12,184
<i>and now the challenge is
to fit them together without a hitch.</i>

136
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,656
THE DRESS REHEARSAL BEGINS

137
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:26,299
<i>The franticness backstage
makes it seem like a war's going on.</i>

138
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,070
<i>They're constantly changing costume</i>

139
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:33,339
<i>and moving around,
fighting for every second.</i>

140
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:40,713
<i>They're sweating this much
a little under 30 minutes in.</i>

141
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:44,150
You still have two minutes.

142
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:49,589
<i>The crew's help is essential
for the costume changes. However...</i>

143
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:52,925
Where's my wig?

144
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,462
<i>Iwamoto's wig is nowhere to be seen.</i>

145
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,397
My wig!

146
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:00,099
My wig!

147
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,370
We're wasting time.

148
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:10,576
<i>Can they iron out all these kinks
before the real thing tomorrow?</i>

149
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:16,449
<i>They also need to give attention
to their junior performers.</i>

150
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:20,086
Don't look down like this.
Be bold and open.

151
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:23,456
I know you're uneasy because
you don't know what will happen.

152
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:26,192
But the audience doesn't know that,
so make it big.

153
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,760
Just don't cause an accident.

154
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:35,468
<i>Will they meet the hopes of Takizawa,
the man who entrusted them with this?</i>

155
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:41,240
I think your job in entertainment
is to work as one unified body

156
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:44,010
to convey a message
through your performance.

157
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,980
I really want <i>Takizawa Kabuki</i>
to be something for the performers

158
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,817
to really put their hearts and souls into
and show their passion.

159
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:56,489
What we're doing is real Kabuki,
real taiko drumming.

160
00:10:56,956 --> 00:11:01,861
We're not professionals at those things,
but it's our task

161
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:07,767
to show the audience
our passion for taking those things on.

162
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:13,239
<i>At long last, the day is here.</i>

163
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:14,674
FEBRUARY 3, 2019

164
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:17,376
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

165
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:20,513
Good morning! It's the day of the show!

166
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:21,647
Yeah!

167
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:24,016
This is awesome!

168
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:27,520
<i>Used during a production's run,</i>

169
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:31,223
<i>this is a</i> chakutoban<i>, used by the cast
to sign in as they arrive.</i>

170
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,059
<i>This gets them fired up.</i>

171
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:39,932
<i>This band member
hasn't had a single day off</i>

172
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:42,835
<i>for the three weeks
leading up to the opening night.</i>

173
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:46,305
{\an8}We still haven't really started.
Tonight's the first show.

174
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,507
{\an8}But I'm exhausted.

175
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:51,243
I had a quick bite to eat yesterday

176
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:55,581
then came back and watched
the recording of the dress rehearsal.

177
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:59,852
I made notes of all the things
we need to improve on.

178
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:02,822
I want to do my best.

179
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:06,726
-I look forward to it.
-Thanks.

180
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:14,266
<i>Meanwhile, how's Iwamoto doing
after there was concern about his injury?</i>

181
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:17,670
Did you manage to sleep at all?

182
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:18,804
Like a log.

183
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:27,613
<i>A wall down the corridor
has been decorated.</i>

184
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:30,349
Cool, right?

185
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:33,853
To think they'd give us
this much coverage.

186
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:39,692
<i>Scenes from yesterday's dress rehearsal
are being used in big newspaper spreads</i>

187
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,128
<i>to coincide with the opening night.</i>

188
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:48,367
There you go. The opening night
of <i>Takizawa Kabuki ZERO</i>.

189
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,171
Time to go bean-throwing.

190
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,574
{\an8}<i>It's February 3rd, the Setsubun festival.</i>

191
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,144
-Come on.
-Let's go.

192
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:03,048
<i>In the bean-throwing ceremony,
they'll pray for a safe three weeks</i>

193
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,050
<i>as they perform at Minamiza,
and for no bad luck.</i>

194
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:07,386
-Demons!
-There are demons!

195
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:10,589
They're working.

196
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,627
<i>They were about to throw the beans, but...</i>

197
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,164
You stay down low for this bit.

198
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:20,933
Then lift it up.

199
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:23,903
It's Setsubun!

200
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:26,605
-Not yet, Koji.
-Oh, sorry!

201
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:28,974
Which bit is it?

202
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,243
The bit at the start the goes...

203
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,678
{\an8}-This bit?
-Yeah.

204
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,113
{\an8}One, two, three, four.

205
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:39,418
<i>Before they knew it, they're absorbed
in checking their choreography.</i>

206
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:47,793
It's all about the first beat in this one.
Just remember that.

207
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,165
<i>Will the show be a success?</i>

208
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:56,936
<i>They're definitely dedicating a lot
of energy to this question.</i>

209
00:13:58,103 --> 00:14:01,941
{\an8}I don't want people just to be going on
about the technology.

210
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:04,543
{\an8}I want this show to be the first step

211
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:09,215
{\an8}towards people recognizing
that we really know what we're doing.

212
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,183
{\an8}It's about meeting the demands

213
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,819
{\an8}of all the parts of the show,
which come thick and fast.

214
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:19,992
It's like I have an iron rod down my back
the whole time. I have to get it perfect.

215
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:25,064
{\an8}There's a sense of not wanting to waste
everything we've done so far.

216
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:28,234
You need to think about
what you're here for.

217
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:31,036
{\an8}30 MINUTES TO THE SHOW

218
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:33,272
{\an8}<i>It's 30 minutes until the curtains go up.</i>

219
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:36,475
<i>A line snakes outside the theater.</i>

220
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:43,215
<i>The band members head for Takizawa's room.</i>

221
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:46,085
<i>It's a tradition observed each year.</i>

222
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:47,720
Hurry up.

223
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:50,723
-Five minutes.
-Hello!

224
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:52,491
-We've come to see you.
-Huh?

225
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,960
-We came to pay you a visit.
-You didn't have to.

226
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:57,029
-Whoa!
-Don't say sad things like that.

227
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:58,464
We do this every year.

228
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:00,499
You're in charge now.

229
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,002
Right, I'll see you
in my dressing room, then.

230
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:06,972
Let's head back!

231
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,073
We're not going.

232
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:14,246
<i>The torch has already been passed.</i>

233
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:18,017
<i>Nobody is in charge but themselves.</i>

234
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:25,991
15 MINUTES TO THE SHOW

235
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:30,529
Are you nervous?

236
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,499
Yeah, but it's different
from normal nerves.

237
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,001
It's more excitement.

238
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:39,271
-This is going to be a blast.
-Yeah!

239
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,274
<i>But even so...</i>

240
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:45,044
I think I'll go down.

241
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:51,550
It's no use, I can't calm down.

242
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:53,752
{\an8}SHOTA WATANABE (AGE 26)

243
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:55,888
{\an8}I'm feel restless too, so I'll join him.

244
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,658
Okay.

245
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:03,729
Everyone will be fine.

246
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:08,100
The cast. The crew.

247
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,836
And if the audience are ready for it,

248
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:17,643
I'll take them into that world.

249
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:27,252
<i>Iwamoto has led Snow Man
since they were first formed.</i>

250
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:33,092
<i>Perhaps to reassure himself, he says
how ready he is over and over again.</i>

251
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:40,332
I'm planning on going to a world
not even Takizawa has imagined.

252
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:43,602
In the snap of a finger.

253
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:48,807
<i>The show will begin any minute now.</i>

254
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,384
<i>The theater is filled with spectators
waiting for that very moment.</i>

255
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:07,459
ONE MINUTE TO THE SHOW

256
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,862
<i>Snow Man's future hangs on this endeavor.</i>

257
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:20,873
<i>They welcome this moment
with the greatest smiles.</i>

258
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:34,319
FEBRUARY 3
THE OPENING NIGHT OF <i>TAKIZAWA KABUKI ZERO</i>

259
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:37,556
<i>The curtain lifts
on a new</i> Takizawa Kabuki.

260
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:24,503
MUSICAL SUITE

261
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:27,072
{\an8}<i>Japanese music with Western dance.</i>

262
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:40,786
{\an8}SWORD FIGHT (MONOCHROME)

263
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:52,598
{\an8}BALLAD "MY FRIEND"

264
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:01,039
TAIKO DRUMS

265
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:05,244
<i>What the band members spent more time
than anything else on in training...</i>

266
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:07,012
<i>The taiko.</i>

267
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:35,774
{\an8}<i>TAKIZAWA KABUKI GOEMON ZERO</i>

268
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,277
{\an8}<i>And now even deeper into old Japan.</i>

269
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:52,157
{\an8}<i>TAKIZAWA KABUKI</i> SAKURA NO MAI DANCE

270
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:04,536
{\an8}<i>The climax of the play is the ladder,
for which Iwamoto has overcome his injury.</i>

271
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:09,675
<i>Watching the show, it's clear to see</i>

272
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:14,346
<i>that this form of entertainment that fuses
all these Japanese elements has blossomed.</i>

273
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:37,169
Takizawa Kabuki ZERO.

274
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:41,840
<i>Tonight, they've used up
every last one of their abilities.</i>

275
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:44,876
Thank you.

276
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:46,878
-Great show.
-Thanks, everyone.

277
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:50,582
I love <i>ZERO</i>!

278
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,687
<i>The dressing rooms, after the show.</i>

279
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:58,991
<i>Everyone's beaming from ear to ear.</i>

280
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:02,094
That was seriously the best.

281
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:03,862
Great, wasn't it?

282
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:10,335
I feel our energy and enthusiasm
came across to the audience.

283
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:17,376
<i>Still excited, Iwamoto and Fukazawa
are heading somewhere.</i>

284
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:24,483
<i>It's a show debriefing
with the main crew members.</i>

285
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:29,821
<i>What they want to hear above all</i>

286
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:32,324
<i>is the appraisal of Takizawa himself.</i>

287
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:37,929
On the whole,
there were no problems at all.

288
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:43,168
As the initial excitement goes down a bit,

289
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:44,903
you might find it feels routine.

290
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:48,640
So ideally, I'd like you to retain
this level of enthusiasm throughout,

291
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:50,142
if I had to say anything.

292
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:55,180
<i>The important thing
is that they don't lose their passion.</i>

293
00:21:56,548 --> 00:22:00,986
I feel grateful and happy
that we've done the first show,

294
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,888
but this isn't the finish line.

295
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:06,692
There is no finish line
with <i>Takizawa Kabuki</i>.

296
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:14,433
That's it.
Thank you for being with us for so long.

297
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:27,112
<i>From the first day of training
to the final night at Minamiza,</i>

298
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:30,148
<i>Snow Man have charged ahead
without stopping.</i>

299
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:39,257
This is crazy.

300
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,203
Takizawa-kun!

301
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:52,838
-Here it comes.
-Right.

302
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:56,775
It's all about the first beat.

303
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:08,854
{\an8}APRIL-MAY 2019

304
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,723
{\an8}Takizawa Kabuki <i>has no finish line.</i>

305
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:15,560
Wouldn't it actually be better
to come forward here?

306
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:20,999
{\an8}<i>Just like how they're back in action
as they're joined by Raul.</i>

307
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:23,335
{\an8}<i>for the next leg of the show.</i>

308
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:38,517
{\an8}<i>Their new journey that began with</i> ZERO

309
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:42,020
{\an8}<i>moves to the next step.</i>

310
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:49,461
{\an8}<i>Snow Man, a unit with an overwhelming
amount of passion.</i>

311
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:57,335
<i>And they're going to keep on dancing.</i>
