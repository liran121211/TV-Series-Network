00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:07,801
{\an8}<i>and follow them as they work
to prepare the concert stage.</i>

19
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:10,703
{\an8}<i>Unexpected trouble.</i>

20
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:13,173
{\an8}<i>Time ticking away.</i>

28
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:03,723
All right!

29
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,992
Channel your nerves into energy.

Are you crying?

31
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:08,695
Be careful not to injure yourself.

32
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:09,662
That's right.

33
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,231
-Okay.
-Keep control.

34
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,232

00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:27,013
{\an8}STAGE FACILITATOR
MASAHIRO UEDA (AGE 27)

<i>They each have different job descriptions
and positions, but what they share</i>

51
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:09,989
{\an8}<i>is the desire to give the fans
the time of their life.</i>

52
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:16,162
{\an8}<i>The duration of the Hey! Say! JUMP tour
is about five months.</i>

53
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:21,034
<i>Even rookies are expected to

54
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:23,503
-Hey.
-Yes.

55
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,205
-Come here right now.
-Yes.

56
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:28,641
I feel like I could've done more.

57
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:31,077
But it's difficult.

58
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,646
I'm constantly exhausted.

59
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,916
I don't have a clear picture
of the end result,

60
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,484
so I'm very worried.

61
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,787
It's spilling.

62
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:45,158
There's been some trouble,
so that has set us back.

63
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:49,195
I've never been this nervous before.

64
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:54,534
<i>The flashy world of entertainment
sells dreams to its consumers.</i>

65
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:58,638
<i>But it's a harsh world behind the scenes.</i>

66
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:02,342
<i>We will follow four individuals</i>

67
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:04,811

00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:16,155
<i>Three days before the tour's opening day.</i>

00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:20,493
SETTING UP
DAY 1

71
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,365
<i>As the stage is being set
by over 150 staff members,</i>

72
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:29,869
<i>these four individuals take position
with their own goals in mind.</i>

73
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:34,507
I was hired three months ago.
It's the first time I'm joining a tour.

74
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:36,409
This is my first day.

75
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,812
{\an8}There's a stage director
and a choreographer,

76
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:44,183
{\an8}and each has their own image and ideas

77
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,086
{\an8}of how they want the stage
to look for each performance.

78
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:50,556
Our job is to bring that into fruition.

79
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:55,295
My job is to care for the needs
of the group members.

80
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:59,732
I also mark the stage so it's easier for
them to take their positions when dancing.

81
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:04,103
That way, when it comes time
for the concert,

82
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:07,473
they can perform exactly the same
as they did during rehearsal.

83
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:12,178
Each circumstance, location,
and arena has its own characteristics.

84
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:15,348
So we make sure we adapt
to those differences.

85

STAGE FACILITATOR

86
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:19,352
<i>The stage facilitator team,
to which Ueda belongs,</i>

87
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:22,755
<i>is in charge of everything from
preparation to dismantling.</i>

88
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:26,492
<i>Their main role is to make sure
the concert goes on without a hitch.</i>

89
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,595
{\an8}<i>With the stage manager in the lead,</i>

90
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,165
{\an8}<i>the team is made up of ten members.</i>

91
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:35,902
{\an8}<i>Ueda is the newest member,
so he must listen to his seniors</i>

92
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:39,939
{\an8}<i>and do everything from running errands
to assisting stage production.</i>

93
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:45,311
<i>What is the difficult part of being
a stage facilitator?</i>

94
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,581
Can you come here for a second?

95
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:54,220
From building the stage to overseeing
the concert and then dismantling,

96
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:58,024
the most important thing
is safety management.

97
00:05:58,558 --> 00:05:59,826
That includes the way we work,

98
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:04,097
and also making sure
there are no problems with the equipment.

99
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:07,734
We're also responsible
for time management.

100
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:10,570
As for the actual day of the concert,

101
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:14,207
we're in charge of the moving props
and the placement of each member.

102
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,276
We also help to connect
the various sections.

103
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:20,313
As stage crew,
we take the stage director's image

104
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:24,817
and try to figure out which sections
can take on certain responsibilities,

105
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:29,989
and together we discuss
how we can bring that image to life.

106
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,759
That's our main role.

107
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,361
{\an8}Have the lighting crew do
that part all at once.

108
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:38,064
{\an8}All the cables here will be the same,

109
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:39,766
{\an8}so gather it to that side.

110
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,168
{\an8}Gather it together once it's done,

111
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,137
{\an8}and that will connect the lighting.

112
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:47,807
{\an8}Once you finish checking it,
lift it up and do this area.

113
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:52,078
-Can you do it?
-Yes.

114
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:53,946
They're all placed over there.

115
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:59,519
<i>Even though Ueda is new to this field,
he must remember all the technical terms.</i>

116
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:05,925
More than the terminology,
it's difficult to keep up with the pace.

117
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:08,094
It's very fast-paced,

118
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,264
so I have a hard time catching up
and understanding.

119
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,967
I just have to get used to it.

120
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:19,138
I have to do my best.
I can't slow down the team.

121
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:25,645
<i>Why did Ueda choose to become
a stage facilitator?</i>

122
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,214
The main reason is,

123
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:34,887
when I would hear the audience cheering
and having a good time during a concert,

124
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:40,927
I thought it would be nice to create
something like that as part of my job.

125
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:42,361
It looked cool.

126
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:45,498
This is my first tour.

127
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:50,002
I'm so anxious.

128
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:54,707
<i>"Full of anxiety."</i>

129
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,776
<i>True to those words,</i>

130
00:07:56,843 --> 00:08:00,079
<i>stage facilitators receive requests
from various departments,</i>

131
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,315
<i>so they must deal with trouble every day.</i>

132
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:06,152
<i>Each time, they must assess
the situation accurately.</i>

133
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:09,489
<i>In other words,
it requires resourcefulness.</i>

134
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:18,965
<i>At two in the afternoon,
a team of women arrive on site.</i>

135
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:23,135
<i>It's the special effects team,
and this woman is one of its members.</i>

136
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:26,539
{\an8}My name is Michiru Yabe. I'm 21 years old.

137
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:30,009
{\an8}This is my second year on the job.

138
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:32,778
{\an8}I belong to the section

139
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:36,182
{\an8}called special effects.

140
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:40,019
{\an8}<i>Their role is to brightly
light up the stage.</i>

141
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:44,290
What we're using this time
is called a scroller.

142
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:51,030
It's a device that hangs up above
and scatters gold and silver confetti.

143
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:55,334
{\an8}We also use theatrical smoke,

144
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:59,405
{\an8}and sparklers
which shoot sparks into the air.

145
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:01,874
There's also a piece of equipment
called a color flame

146
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:06,279
that shoots out green, blue
and red flames.

147
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:08,447
We also use silver streamers.

148
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:11,517
Our job includes all of those
stage productions.

149
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:17,557
<i>This job involves stage production,
so at first glance it may seem flashy,</i>

150
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,226
<i>but it's a series of
slow and steady tasks.</i>

151
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,564
We draw up the cables,

152
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,833
{\an8}and we also set up the address codes
that are necessary

153
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,037
{\an8}to operate these pieces of equipment.

154
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:34,874
<i>One misprinted number</i>

155
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:36,709
<i>can ruin the entire production.</i>

156
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:42,315
{\an8}<i>Nikami, her senior, is also on the team,</i>

157
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:44,216
{\an8}<i>but everyone else is support staff.</i>

158
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:47,887
<i>She doesn't have much strength,</i>

159
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,457
<i>but she must carry heavy equipment
by herself.</i>

160
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:53,159
SPECIAL EFFECTS
ASAKI NIKAMI

161
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:55,361
At first, you're like Yabe
and don't have much strength.

162
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,798
But you build muscle over time.

163
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,302
We have to be as strong as the boys.

164
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,243
<i>"We have to be as strong as the boys."
That's what Nikami says.</i>

165
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:15,414
<i>Why did Yabe choose a job
that requires hard labor?</i>

166
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:20,386
I've always played the piano
and wind instruments,

167
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:25,658
so ever since I was young
my dream was to work with music.

168
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:31,831
The first time I went to a concert,
the atmosphere left a big impact on me,

169
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:36,869
and it made me want to be
part of this field of work.

170
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:40,139
Special effects like the flames and
silver streamers at the end of the show

171
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:42,875
made a strong impression on me.

172
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:45,645
That's what made me want to be part of

173
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,546
the special effects team.

174
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,050
<i>This is the world she's always admired.</i>

175
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:52,585
<i>But...</i>

176
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,621
<i>these women are about to face a setback</i>

177
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:57,990
<i>that will crush their high spirits.</i>

178
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:02,428
<i>At four in the afternoon,</i>

179
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:06,298
<i>we can see a man helping
the sound team carry in their equipment.</i>

180
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:13,139
{\an8}My name is Takuma Kuramochi.
I turn 23 this year.

181
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:16,208
{\an8}I believe this is my third year.

182
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:18,844
{\an8}During the concert, the PA is in charge of

183
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:22,715
{\an8}the sound that comes from the speakers.

184
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:25,317
{\an8}The sound that comes through the speakers

185
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:28,988
{\an8}is picked up by microphones
or made on the computer.

186
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:31,791
{\an8}There are various methods,
but the main role

187
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:33,926
{\an8}of a PA is to create sound.

188
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,629
<i>For the first time ever,</i>

189
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:40,499
<i>Kuramochi has been assigned
the position as stage chief.</i>

190
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:42,601
<i>It's a heavy responsibility.</i>

191
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:46,772
During the concert,
we have to give and receive the mics.

192
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:51,377
There are also ear monitors
that we have to put on and take off.

193
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:55,281
So, during the rehearsal
and the actual performance,

194
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:58,617
our main job is to personally attach
the equipment on the members

195
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:00,786
and collect them when they're done.

196
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:05,357
<i>Passing the audio equipment to each artist</i>

197
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,027
<i>may sound easy,</i>

198
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:11,597
<i>but unless they are aware
of the artist's every move,</i>

199
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,799
<i>it could end up causing a delay.</i>

200
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:20,639
Today, we did something new
and put lights on the speakers.

201
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:24,310
So, it took a little longer than usual.
We had to wait a bit,

202
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:27,346
then add the lights,
then connect the speaker.

203
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:30,583
It wasn't our usual day,
but it went smoothly.

204
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:33,652
I'm still a newbie, but...

205
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,890
as I watch the concerts,
I notice that there are times

206
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:40,960
when the audience is excited,
and times when they're moved.

207
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:45,064
These concerts provide
many emotional moments,

208
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:47,066
so I don't want to get in the way of that.

209
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:50,436
When they're supposed to feel moved,
the sound should convey those feelings,

210
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:54,540
and when it's a more exciting part,
the sound should give them energy.

211
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:56,909
In other words,

212
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:00,513
I think this job requires us to make sure

213
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:02,381
that nothing feels out of place.

214
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,716
5 P.M.

215
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,417
<i>One hour later,</i>

216
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:09,488
<i>the special mechanics team begin
to carry in their equipment.</i>

217
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:12,391
{\an8}My name is Shoichiro Fukuda.
I'm 24 years old.

218
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:15,094
{\an8}This is my second year.

219
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:19,799
<i>Not many people have heard
of "special mechanics."</i>

220
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:22,268
<i>This team is responsible for creating</i>

221
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:25,805
<i>a stage that goes up and down,
and rotates around.</i>

222
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:29,842
<i>This shifting stage is a big attraction</i>

223
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:31,644
<i>for the concert this time.</i>

224
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:38,350
<i>As a second-year employee,
Fukuda's role is...</i>

225
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:43,122
Within my team right now,

226
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,291
I hold the lowest position.

227
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:48,260
So, I mainly do wiring and connect cables

228
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:51,463
so that everything works properly.

229
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:55,534
<i>This time, he has been placed
in charge of operating</i>

230
00:13:55,601 --> 00:14:00,105
<i>one of the apparatuses called a lifter
that's attached to the main stage.</i>

231
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:05,511
I feel like I'm part of a big project.

232
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:08,247
It feels as though

233
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:11,217
I'm dealing with a large amount of money.

234
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:14,086
Even from a financial point of view,

235
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:18,023
I feel like we're placed in charge of
something very big.

236
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,960
I'm saying this in a very broad sense.

237
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:26,465
<i>Eight in the evening. All the teams have
brought in their equipment.</i>

238
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:28,667
<i>It's finally time to begin preparation.</i>

239
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:30,803
SPECIAL EFFECTS

240
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,206
<i>Yabe is connecting equipment for
special effects</i>

241
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:37,443
<i>onto the large structure that will
hang over the center of the arena.</i>

242
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:41,413
Ms. Nikami, can I tape up
all the connectors?

243
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:44,917
No, not yet. I'll attach it

244
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:46,118
over here first.

245
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:49,088
{\an8}<i>It's my very first arena tour.</i>

246
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:52,791
{\an8}<i>I've always wanted to be part of
a tour group,</i>

247
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:55,160
{\an8}so I'm filled with nerves and anxiety.

248
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:59,865
I want to do all that I can
and give my very best.

249
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,770
<i>It's only the first day, but there
is no end to the workload.</i>

250
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:07,706
<i>Until the tour ends,</i>

251
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:10,976
<i>they can neither get much sleep
nor take any time off.</i>

252
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:17,249
<i>But they are happy to be
involved in this work.</i>

253
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,522
This is baby powder.

254
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,725
Static electricity makes
the confetti stick together.

255
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,894
This is to prevent that from happening.

256
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:33,999
<i>This is the secret to prevent the shiny
confetti from sticking together.</i>

257
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,703
This opening is too small.

258
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:40,239
My arms won't fit.

259
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,076
<i>Drawn to the world that creates
these techniques,</i>

260
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:46,178
<i>she chose this career for herself.</i>

261
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:49,014
These are scrollers.

262
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:55,754
They're devices that hang up above
and scatter gold and silver confetti.

263
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:01,860
<i>But soon after,</i>

264
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:07,866
<i>unexpected trouble befalls
Yabe and the special effects team.</i>

265
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:14,840
Don't block this side right here.

266
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:16,241
It will block people out.

267
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,744
<i>The special mechanics team
operates the moving stage,</i>

268
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:23,649
<i>which is necessary to create
a dynamic stage performance.</i>

269
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:26,585
{\an8}<i>Fukuda, the youngest team member,</i>

270
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:31,023
{\an8}<i>is busy carrying and assembling
heavy steel frames.</i>

271
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,791
{\an8}SPECIAL MECHANICS
FUKUDA SHOICHIRO (AGE 24)

272
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:34,994
{\an8}Let's place this over there.

273
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:37,663
My rank within this team is low,

274
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,166
but since I'm working with
all sorts of people,

275
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:43,736
I want to make sure to inform them

276
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:49,475
about things I have to do,
or things I know how to do,

277
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,777
and make sure I don't slow down the team.

278
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:55,314
That's my goal this time around.

279
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:57,216
{\an8}<i>At the same time,</i>

280
00:16:57,282 --> 00:17:01,487
{\an8}<i>Kuramochi is conducting
a meeting with the sound team.</i>

281
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:05,457
{\an8}<i>They are discussing how to pass
the microphones during the concert.</i>

282
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:09,895
When the performance ends,
go to the GL stairs

283
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:13,999
and these four members will come

284
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:16,135
to retrieve the handheld microphones.

285
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,704
As for who will retrieve them...

286
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:22,040
<i>He explains the microphone schedule
for the entire two-hour concert</i>

287
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:24,109
<i>one performance at a time.</i>

288
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:28,213
<i>It's hard to do everything perfectly.</i>

289
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,216
<i>But because they strive for perfection,</i>

290
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:34,420
<i>even the smallest of details
do not go unnoticed.</i>

291
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,321
<i>But even then...</i>

292
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:40,993
During the encore,
we'll take the microphones

293
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,395
and go toward the main stage.

294
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:46,465
-And also remove the headsets?
-Yes, that's right.

295
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,536
<i>He receives a reminder
from an experienced member.</i>

296
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,006
<i>This is his first experience
as a stage chief.</i>

297
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:56,675
<i>It's a heavy responsibility.</i>

298
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:04,683
Ever since I started this job,
I've been preparing myself for this,

299
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:08,187
so instead of panicking,

300
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:11,123
I feel like this is
a great challenging opportunity.

301
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,495
<i>And then, at 9:30 p.m...</i>

302
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,031
<i>trouble arises.</i>

303
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:21,934
<i>An apparatus called the rounded truss,</i>

304
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,204
<i>used for attaching lights
and special effects,</i>

305
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,072
<i>will not go up.</i>

306
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,641
{\an8}It might be the weight.

{\an8}STAGE FACILITATOR
MASAHIRO UEDA (AGE 27)

308
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:34,713
{\an8}The calculation should be correct, but...

309
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,748
{\an8}it's overweight and won't go up.

310
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,285
-We're taking two units down.
-Two units?

SPECIAL EFFECTS

312
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,423
<i>Are some pieces of equipment
over the weight limit?</i>

313
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,059
<i>They decide to test it out</i>

314
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:52,331
<i>by dismantling the heaviest equipment
which happens to be the scroller.</i>

315
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:54,333
<i>Yabe and her team are called.</i>

316
00:18:57,836 --> 00:18:58,871
-Hey.
-Yes.

317
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:01,173
-Come here.
-Yes, sir.

318
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:06,512
<i>The stage manager takes command,</i>

319
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:11,550
{\an8}<i>and they decide to take down
two of the four scrollers.</i>

320
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:15,754
<i>Will this resolve the issue?</i>

321
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:18,624
-Let's test it once.
-Okay.

322
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,226
Sorry, we're going to raise
it one more time.

323
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:23,295
Okay.

324
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:26,532
We're going to raise the inner section.

325
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,438
It's not working.

326
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,574
We took down 100 kilos.

327
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:38,911
{\an8}That truss is hanging on four lines.

328
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:40,846
{\an8}Those four lines

329
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:44,049
{\an8}have a maximum weight capacity
of 800 kilos.

330
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:46,218
{\an8}That was our calculation.

331
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:48,754
{\an8}We placed 770 kilos of equipment on it.

332
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:52,724
{\an8}When we tried to pull it up,
it could not raise 770 kilos.

333
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:54,826
{\an8}MAXIMUM WEIGHT = 800 KILOS
PREPARED EQUIPMENT = 770 KILOS

00:19:56,028 --> 00:20:00,165
<i>The scrollers should be within
the specified weight limit,</i>

335
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:01,833
<i>but it still won't rise.</i>

336
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:04,970
<i>They will have to make some changes.</i>

337
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:08,640
{\an8}<i>One by one, they remove the scrollers</i>

338
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:10,943
{\an8}<i>to find out what the problem is.</i>

339
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:15,180
{\an8}We'll test it again
and call you if we need you.

340
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:18,050
-What?
-Special effects team!

341
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:19,985
We're taking them all down?

342
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:21,920
I'll lift it up.

343
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:23,455
Okay.

344
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:30,829
{\an8}<i>They ended up taking down
all four scrollers,</i>

345
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:33,065
{\an8}<i>but it still won't go up.</i>

346
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,803
<i>All Yabe can do is stand back and wait.</i>

347
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:41,673
<i>As the investigation continues,</i>

348
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,943
<i>the special effects team comes to a halt.</i>

349
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:47,012
We're sorry!

350
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:50,582
It feels like I just set up
four concert arenas.

351
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:55,654
<i>Ueda, the rookie stage facilitator
is frozen in place.</i>

352
00:20:58,123 --> 00:20:59,558
This is life.

353
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:05,030
<i>It's 10:40 p.m.</i>

354
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:09,534
<i>Ueda and the stage facilitator team</i>

355
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,870
<i>receive a message from the stage manager.</i>

356
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:14,873
<i>Attention everyone.</i>

357
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,144
<i>As for the center circle,</i>

358
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:23,348
<i>we got in contact with the truss engineer,</i>

359
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:25,617
<i>and he will be here around 11:10.</i>

360
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:28,887
<i>After he gets here,</i>

361
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:32,324
<i>we can decide what to do.
Personally, I'd like to</i>

362
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:36,295
<i>revert back to the original plan.</i>

363
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:38,163
<i>So, whether that's possible</i>

364
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:41,166
<i>or if it would require extra procedures,</i>

365
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:45,003
<i>is something we'll have to wait until
after 11 to find out.</i>

366
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:48,106
<i>Then we'll decide if
we'll do it today or tomorrow.</i>

367
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:50,942
<i>Okay.</i>

368
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:58,950
<i>The special effects team has to wait for
further notice from the stage manager.</i>

369
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:04,823
That's the most important thing.

370
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:09,094
When they have creases,
the air resistance makes them

371
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,395
drop slowly.

372
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:14,299
The dimensions will sparkle
against the lights too.

373
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:16,735
That's why it's better to crease them.

374
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,705
To think that this blows away
in an instant.

375
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:22,441
Welcome back.

376
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:27,012
-Tomorrow?
-Tomorrow.

377
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:33,151
<i>In the end, each team must carry
their work over to the next day.</i>

378
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,388
It's the first time experiencing
weight issues.

379
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:39,257
So, these six parts are not done yet.

380
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:46,264
<i>Will the special effects team have to
give up on using the scrollers?</i>

381
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,534
<i>It's been a long day.</i>

382
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:54,439
<i>Signs of fatigue are showing on
the faces of these young workers.</i>

383
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:57,943
You need to be sharp. You're not sharp.

384
00:22:58,009 --> 00:22:58,844
Okay.

385
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:02,714
Let's clean up, and we'll go home.

386
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:06,718
<i>In order to create a special stage,</i>

387
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:10,822
<i>they must overcome big obstacles.</i>

388
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,925
There were lots of issues.

389
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,428
But I think

390
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:19,598
tomorrow will be even more difficult.

391
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,503
<i>Time is ticking away.</i>

392
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:27,806
<i>The countdown to showtime won't stop.</i>

393
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:32,677
<i>The time left until the first day
of the concert is</i>

394
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:35,046
<i>two days.</i>

395
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,955
{\an8}<i>On the next</i> Ride On Time<i>...</i>

396
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:49,261
{\an8}As we get to the end,
we're shorter on time,

397
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:50,662
{\an8}so it's very tiring.

398
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:54,232
{\an8}<i>Four youths are striving to create
a special concert.</i>

399
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:58,770
{\an8}<i>What awaits them
on the road ahead?</i>
