69
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:19,926
<i>The members and staff

<i>that requires a safety check.</i>

71
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,699
<i>It is one of the concert's

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,770

{\an8}<i>Controlling it

75

{\an8}The lifters are attached
to the main platform,

76
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:44,684
and some lifters are raised
above the surface of the stage,

77
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:47,987
while some go below the stage
to spin around,

78
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:49,856
with various height settings.

79
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:52,358
So those are the various types of lifters.

80
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:55,561
I'll be near the lifters,
to operate the machine.

81

<i>This mobile stage helps
to deliver a dynamic stage.</i>

82
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:05,872
<i>But because of that, it comes with risks.</i>

83
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:10,476
<i>The rehearsal for
this stage alone takes three hours.</i>

84
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:15,048
{\an8}There are things we use
for the actual performance

85
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:18,818
{\an8}like the equipment, machines, and props.

86
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:23,156
When we use them during
the rehearsal, we find that it doesn't go

87
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:25,224
the way we had planned on paper.

88
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:28,261
That's why spending three hours
with the staff to discuss

89
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,530
all the issues that need attention

90
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:34,200
is a very important process.

91
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:37,704
And once we all agree
that it's completely safe,

92
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:41,207
we can have the JUMP members use it.

93

00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:11,611
It'll either fall or stay up there.

174
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:14,780
Whatever is there after the ring drops,

175
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:18,751
I can pick up. So make sure
to have the ring set up.

176
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:19,785
Okay.

177
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:25,925
<i>It's only been three months
since Ueda started this job.</i>

178
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:29,829
<i>But he can't slow everybody down.</i>

179
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:34,100
I want to take the responsibility
I've been given

180
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:41,240
and complete it with a high level
of quality, without making any mistakes.

181
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:46,545
Eventually, I want to reach the top
and become a stage director.

182
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:51,017
{\an8}The one that sends out
cues and things like that.

183
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:56,355
{\an8}I hope I can gain more skills
to reach that level.

184
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,259
<i>It's almost time for the dress rehearsal.</i>

185
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:06,499
<i>The members changed
into their costumes and started to check</i>

186
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:08,968
<i>the special effects equipment
called sparklers.</i>

187
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:13,272
{\an8}Please turn on the sparklers.

188
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,042
{\an8}Get ready.

189
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:18,210
{\an8}SPARKLER: SPECIAL EFFECT FIREWORKS
THAT ARE SAFE TO TOUCH

190
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,318
Wow it's not hot at all.

191
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:29,388
This will be shooting out the whole time.

192
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:31,090
{\an8}<i>Watching over the rehearsal</i>

193
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:33,726
{\an8}<i>is Michiru Yabe from
the special effects team.</i>

194
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:39,598
<i>She has a strong determination
towards this job.</i>

195
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,635
MICHIRU YABE

196
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,570
<i>During junior high school and high school,</i>

197
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:48,240
<i>she dreamed of working
in the music industry,</i>

198
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:50,910
<i>but she realized her limitation,</i>

199
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,912
<i>and gave up that dream.</i>

200
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:54,480
<i>But...</i>

201
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,550
{\an8}HEY! SAY! JUMP JUMP NATIONWIDE TOUR 2013

202
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,754
{\an8}<i>She found her new dream</i>

203
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:03,889
{\an8}<i>when her friend invited her</i>

204
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:05,624
{\an8}<i>to a Hey! Say! JUMP concert.</i>

205
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,662
<i>She was instantly mesmerized
by the special effects.</i>

206
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:16,602
<i>But even after she started this job,</i>

207
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:19,205
<i>she experienced many setbacks.</i>

208
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,676
In the beginning,

209
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,412
I didn't know anything.

210
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:30,316
I was constantly getting yelled at

211
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:33,018
and being scolded.

212
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:37,623
I was the type that gets depressed
when someone gets mad at me.

213
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:41,694
So I would hide in the bathroom
and cry by myself.

214
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:44,430
I felt like quitting.

215
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:47,700
Even now, I sometimes get the feeling

216
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,603
that this isn't the right job for me.

217
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:53,739
I can't help but feel like that sometimes.

218
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,410
<i>The reason why she didn't give up</i>

219
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,880
<i>is that she wants to create</i>

220
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,649
<i>the same kind of stage
that gave her a new dream.</i>

221
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:10,055
It's the reaction of the audience
when the special effects take place.

222
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:14,860
Special effects tend to get
all the attention.

223
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:17,496
When I help set it up

224
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:21,333
and see it take effect during
the actual performance,

225
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,737
I'm still really moved by

226
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,540
how amazing it is.

227
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:32,344
<i>Individuals like her</i>

228
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:34,647
<i>help to create the concert.</i>

229
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:39,552
Let's get ready to start.

230
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:42,454
<i>The dress rehearsal.</i>

231
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:46,525
<i>Will these youths
be able to get through it?</i>

232
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,264
<i>It's 8 p.m.</i>

233
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,232
Okay.

234
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:57,603
Center stage and below. Everyone except
the members must be on standby.

235
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,738
Thank you!

236
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:04,009
<i>It's finally the dress rehearsal,
where they will conduct the final check.</i>

237
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:08,414
Everyone on standby.

238
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:14,620
<i>Underneath the stage, the members
and staff get into position.</i>

239
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,091
Let's be safe and work hard.

240
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:20,492
Let's work hard.

241
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,228
Sound on.

242
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:26,632
{\an8}DRESS REHEARSAL STARTS

243
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:43,349
Standby!

244
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:53,726
Go!

245
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:02,768
It's going to spin.

246
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,006
<i>It's off to a good start.</i>

247
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,276
<i>The four youths are of one mind.</i>

248
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:14,013
<i>They want to provide a great concert
for the audience.</i>

249
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:19,151
<i>Whether things go well or not,</i>

250
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:22,688
<i>will all depend on the cooperation
between the teams.</i>

251
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:28,260
<i>The first challenge is the quick change.</i>

252
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:37,703
<i>Ueda from the facilitator team
gets ready with the props.</i>

253
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,172
<i>Kuramochi from the sound team</i>

254
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:43,108
<i>gets ready to receive
the members' microphones.</i>

255
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,783
<i>Kuramochi received the microphones
from the members.</i>

256
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:53,619
<i>Now, it's Ueda's turn.</i>

257
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:56,455
Let's start changing!

258
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:04,263
<i>The members' costumes and props</i>

259
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,765
<i>are thrown down one by one</i>

260
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:08,334
<i>into this small area.</i>

261
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:11,704
<i>As a safety precaution,</i>

262
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:14,840
<i>they must be retrieved right away.</i>

263
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:17,209
Don't reach for it.

264
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:29,822
That's good.

265
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,259
Take it.

266
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:39,298
We're off the lifter.

267
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:42,534
Let's transfer this.

268
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,271
<i>However...</i>

269
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:51,210
Okay.

270
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:55,514
Time's up, so this is where we'll end.

271
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,950
Let's discuss the rest later on.

272
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:00,085
9 P.M. DRESS REHEARSAL ENDS

273
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:04,857
<i>They run out of time,
so the dress rehearsal ends</i>

274
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:07,126
<i>without getting halfway through the show.</i>

275
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:12,264
<i>They suddenly decide to finish the rest</i>

276
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:13,732
<i>on the day of the concert.</i>

277
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:20,773
SOUND

278
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:25,044
<i>Kuramochi from the sound team
faces another challenge.</i>

279
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:31,016
{\an8}SOUND
TAKUMA KURAMOCHI (AGE 22)

280
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:35,387
{\an8}I'm not sure, but he may have
stepped on the cable.

281
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:38,357
{\an8}There was a problem,
and the cable disconnected.

282
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,693
{\an8}I'll think of something else.

283
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,000
{\an8}<i>The cables on the tap shoes
were disconnected.</i>

284
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,769
{\an8}<i>It's what he was afraid might happen.</i>

285
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:57,976
<i>He must think of a countermeasure
by tomorrow morning.</i>

286
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:03,816
Let's start.

287
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,753
<i>The managers of each team gather
in the meeting room</i>

288
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,888
<i>to discuss all the details.</i>

289
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:13,559
{\an8}For "Bubble Gum"?

290
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,662
{\an8}I felt like the first part
was a little too cute.

291
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:19,198
This sound, right?

292
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,800
{\an8}Yes, that sound.

293
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:23,435
{\an8}And after that?

294
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:24,703
{\an8}That won't change.

295
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,238
{\an8}Just the first part.

296
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:29,808
This won't change.

297
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:33,045
{\an8}If you can just use the part that goes,

298
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:36,682
{\an8}"dan dara dara ra ran."
That's the part I want.

299
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:45,891
This part can stay the same.

300
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:52,998
-And the next part?
-Yes.

301
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,569
<i>These small adjustments</i>

302
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,239
<i>have a big effect on the final outcome.</i>

303
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:03,842
<i>Tomorrow is the big day.</i>

304
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:09,548
I feel like I could've done more.

305
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:12,551
But it's difficult.

306
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:16,188
MUSASHINO FOREST SPORTS PLAZA MAIN ARENA

307
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:17,222
<i>The next day.</i>

308
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,528
<i>It's finally the day of the concert.</i>

309
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:27,132
<i>But they still have to finish
the dress rehearsal from the day before.</i>

310
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:33,772
{\an8}<i>There are seven hours left
before the concert begins.</i>

311
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,575
SOUND

312
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:40,479
<i>Feeling more anxious than anybody else
was Kuramochi from the sound team.</i>

313
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,949
{\an8}The cable had disconnected...

314
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:44,950
{\an8}SOUND
TAKUMA KURAMOCHI (AGE 22)

315
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,687
{\an8}So I changed the way it attaches
onto the shoe.

316
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:56,061
<i>Trouble occurred
when the small microphone</i>

317
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:58,163
<i>attached to the tap shoes
became disconnected.</i>

318
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:05,604
<i>He hopes to resolve the issue
by improving the way</i>

319
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:07,005
<i>it's taped to the sole.</i>

320
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,979
<i>As the camera was following Kuramochi,</i>

321
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:16,081
<i>Nakajima took notice.</i>

322
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:19,351
We're used to having
cameras follow us around.

323
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:22,688
But I'm so glad to see this.

324
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:25,090
Because we're usually in the limelight.

325
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:31,563
I'm really glad that this provides
an opportunity for the viewers to see

326
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:34,933
all the people working hard
behind the scenes.

327
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:37,236
Thank you.

328
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:41,607
We have a great team here.

329
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,277
LATTER HALF OF THE DRESS REHEARSAL BEGINS

330
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:48,380
<i>The latter half
of the dress rehearsal begins.</i>

331
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:51,316
<i>But below the stage...</i>

332
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:55,687
<i>There was an unexpected accident.</i>

333
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:58,190
<i>They can't find Chinen's microphone.</i>

334
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:02,227
No microphone?

335
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,032
<i>It was not where it should've been.</i>

336
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:12,738
<i>Inexperienced Ueda failed
to catch that mistake.</i>

337
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:15,007
Bring it for him.

338
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,908
It's usually over there.

339
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:21,280
Sometimes the PA can't be here
to help with all that.

340
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:22,214
Okay.

341
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:23,582
I understand.

342
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:25,050
Be ready for the unexpected.

343
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:29,588
<i>Not everything goes as planned.</i>

344
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:33,659
<i>What's important is having the strength</i>

345
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:35,327
<i>to cope with any situation.</i>

346
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:48,774
{\an8}<i>Their last challenge is the mobile stage.</i>

347
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:58,383
<i>They make sure to synchronize the stage</i>

348
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,719
<i>with the members' movements.</i>

349
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:15,801
Okay, now we're ready
for the actual performance.

350
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:17,969
{\an8}END OF DRESS REHEARSAL

351
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:21,573
{\an8}<i>But there's much to do
before the concert begins.</i>

352
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:29,181
{\an8}The dress rehearsal brought out
some points for improvement,

353
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:31,316
{\an8}so we will work on that.

354
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:32,484
{\an8}SPECIAL EFFECTS
MICHIRU YABE (AGE 21)

355
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:37,456
{\an8}I hope to do my very best
during the performance tonight.

356
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:41,560
{\an8}After the doors open, we'll do
another wireless mic check,

357
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,995
{\an8}and check with the musicians.

358
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:46,365
{\an8}SOUND
TAKUMA KURAMOCHI (AGE 22)

359
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:47,532
{\an8}We have a lot to do.

360
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:51,636
How much rice?

361
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,305
Not too much.

362
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,840
Less? Okay.

363
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:59,811
{\an8}<i>The staff members are enjoying
a meal before the concert begins,</i>

364
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:02,347
{\an8}<i>and a nervous-looking Ueda
is one of them.</i>

365
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:03,815
{\an8}STAGE FACILITATOR
MASAHIRO UEDA (AGE 27)

366
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,953
-He's so nervous he's about to throw up.
-Really?

367
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:08,987
You're nervous?

368
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:09,888
Yes.

369
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:11,556
You're that nervous?

370
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:14,960
Are you okay?

371
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:18,096
-I'm okay. I'll do my best.
-Do your best.

372
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:23,034
Sometimes I forget how to do something,

373
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,604
even though I know how to do it.

374
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:28,507
Yes...

375
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:34,146
<i>The venue is already surrounded by fans.</i>

376
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:40,152
<i>There's only one hour left
until the concert begins.</i>

377
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:44,122
{\an8}Thank you.

378
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:45,824
{\an8}-Let's work hard.
-Hello.

379
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:48,260
{\an8}<i>The curtain is about to rise</i>

380
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,629
{\an8}<i>for the first day of the concert.</i>

381
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:53,932
{\an8}<i>Will these four youths be able to</i>

382
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:56,401
{\an8}<i>make it through the entire concert?</i>

383
