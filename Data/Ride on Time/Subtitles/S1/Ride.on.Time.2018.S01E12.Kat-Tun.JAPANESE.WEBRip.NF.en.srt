00:00:01,901 --> 00:00:03,636
{\an8}JULY 27TH ONE WEEK UNTIL
NATIONAL TOUR STARTS

2
00:00:03,703 --> 00:00:08,241
{\an8}<i>Today, the three KAT-TUN members,
who have reunited after two years,</i>

3
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:11,011
{\an8}<i>find themselves in an awkward position.</i>

4
00:00:12,979 --> 00:00:16,649
It's hard. Yeah, it's...

5
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:20,053
I don't know what we should do.

6
00:00:23,656 --> 00:00:24,891
<i>The throes of creation.</i>

7
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:28,661
<i>In order to create something new,</i>

8
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:30,830
<i>this time is necessary.</i>

9
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:56,890
<i>This is documentary series</i> Ride On Time.

10
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,860
{\an8}2016 10TH ANNIVERSARY LIVE
TOKYO DOME

11
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:03,363
{\an8}<i>KAT-TUN debuted in 2006.</i>

12
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:07,467
{\an8}<i>But members left one after another.</i>

13
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:11,771
<i>Two years ago,
after promising they would return,</i>

14
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:13,740
<i>they entered a recharging period.</i>

15
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:19,846
We will prove to you that having this time
is needed to protect KAT-TUN.

16
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:22,982
We're counting on you until then.
Thank you very much.

17
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:28,088
<i>The moment to fulfill
that promise they made</i>

18
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:31,458
<i>to fans all over the country
was approaching.</i>

19
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:38,264
Even before we did the recharging,

20
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:42,702
I thought we could become
something fresh after a restart.

21
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,138
I had confidence.

22
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:49,609
Of course, I had worries,
but I also had confidence.

23
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:52,912
If we didn't do at least that,

24
00:01:55,815 --> 00:02:00,086
I thought we wouldn't be able to
move this ship called KAT-TUN.

25
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,389
I want KAT-TUN
to be a ship that can fight.

26
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:08,628
<i>And then the national tour started.</i>

27
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:15,335
<i>We documented the journey
of their return to the stage.</i>

28
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:23,843
MAY 29TH

29
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:27,413
<i>One month after their
return in Tokyo Dome...</i>

30
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,717
Good work on your Tokyo Dome concerts.

31
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,254
<i>The meetings for the new album,</i> CAST<i>,</i>

32
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,357
<i>and their first album tour
in four years started.</i>

33
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:42,862
<i>First, they need to decide
what the stage will look like.</i>

34
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:49,636
I like the LEDs we've been using,
but they have been so widely used.

35
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:53,139
If we keep it like that,
it will become predictable.

36
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:57,243
I think it would be more interesting
if we added something more than LED.

37
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,246
Like, playing a clip of water falling down

38
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:02,782
on the LED screen,

39
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:05,552
and having real water running
from where the screen ends.

40
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:08,054
If we don't go that far,

41
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:11,224
and just use the latest technology,

42
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,760
I'll feel a little sad.

43
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:18,298
I'm really thankful.
And it's because of that...

44
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:20,600
But to be honest,

45
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,536
anybody could do it, if they had money.

46
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:27,574
So, I want to go with that idea.

47
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:31,678
So, for now the platforms...

48
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:35,181
Instead of platforms,
we'll use a moving stage and...

49
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:39,819
<i>What they suggested was using rails</i>

50
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,988
<i>that move the members while they dance,</i>

51
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:45,124
<i>instead of platforms for the stage.</i>

52
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,095
What are the benefits of the rails?

53
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:51,598
It's easier to use the platforms.

54
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:54,267
With the rails, we can be
moved while we dance.

55
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:57,103
We don't have to walk.

56
00:03:58,004 --> 00:03:59,339
<i>And then, Ueda...</i>

57
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:02,375
There are times when we want to

58
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:04,477
walk on our own feet,

59
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:06,212
and move on our own...

60
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:12,252
without having to ride on something.

61
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:14,854
Because they are arenas,

62
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:18,958
I want to feel a sense of closeness

63
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:20,593
and make use of the space.

64
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:24,264
If they are on this or that side...

65
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,999
<i>In their first meeting,</i>

66
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:31,037
<i>it was agreed that they will
be as close to the fans as possible.</i>

67
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,009
<i>Next, what should they sing?</i>

68
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:41,014
{\an8}<i>It's been four years since KAT-TUN
has done a national tour.</i>

69
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:45,785
{\an8}<i>Should they sing familiar songs
for the fans who've been waiting,</i>

70
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:47,987
{\an8}<i>or perform new songs?</i>

71
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:52,525
<i>What do the members think
regarding that balance?</i>

72
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:54,060
JUNE 13TH

73
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:57,797
I think we don't need to sing
every song from the album.

74
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:02,935
We always have to sing
all the songs on the album, right?

75
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:05,638
I think it's better to use more of

76
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:07,907
our singles and hit songs.

77
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:11,144
So, if you had ten
songs you would leave three out?

78
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,078
Well...

79
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,579
I'd leave half of them out.

80
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,782
Half?

81
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:19,652
But it is a tour for the album, after all.

82
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:21,020
That's right.

83
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:23,089
We need to do this properly

84
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:26,759
and show our fans new performances.

85
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,296
If we don't use at least half
of the new album,

86
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:31,931
those who bought it would be confused.

87
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,099
Half sounds good.

88
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:36,302
{\an8}JULY 2ND 33 DAYS UNTIL NATIONAL TOUR

89
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:38,738
{\an8}<i>There's one month until the national tour.</i>

90
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:48,748
<i>This time, Kamenashi was thinking of doing
an experimental performance.</i>

91
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:52,485
3RD BLOCK

92
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:55,355
<i>That was his solo song, "One way love."</i>

93
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:58,691
{\an8}RECORDING OF KAMENASHI'S
SOLO SONG, "ONE WAY LOVE"

94
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:01,294
{\an8}<i>It's his first time singing
a song entirely in English.</i>

95
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:18,711
<i>It's about the delusional love</i>

96
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:20,913
<i>a man feels toward a woman.</i>

97
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:25,752
<i>One month before the recording,</i>

98
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:29,455
<i>he told the director what he
wanted to include in the song.</i>

99
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:32,825
Sort of erotic?

100
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:33,860
Like when you're...

101
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:37,630
thinking of someone.

102
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,732
-They aren't dating?
-They aren't.

103
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:42,268
It's all in his imagination.

104
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:45,805
Like, "I want to do
this or that with you."

105
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:50,676
<i>How is he going to express
those feelings on stage?</i>

106
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,446
JULY 13TH

107
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:56,883
<i>On this day, a dancer
was called to the studio.</i>

108
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,684
Which way is it?

109
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:01,354
{\an8}<i>He is known worldwide
for his creative dancing,</i>

110
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:03,222
{\an8}<i>Tomohiko Tsujimoto.</i>

111
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:09,762
<i>Kamenashi performed a unique
dance in a commercial.</i>

112
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:11,764
Po!

113
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:14,901
<i>The one who choreographed it
was Tsujimoto.</i>

114
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:22,375
<i>He also helped with
the production of his solo song.</i>

115
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,045
Basically, it'll just be me.

116
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:30,383
I want to be alone
with just my imagination.

117
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:32,585
Without using props.

118
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:35,488
I think it would be good
to use the floor a lot.

119
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:36,789
Do something like that.

120
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:42,061
I think it would be good
to use your body to that extent.

121
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:44,330
It'll be a bit tough.

122
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:47,467
It'll be tough.

123
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:49,168
I will add some tough movements.

124
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:51,337
JULY 18TH

125
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:54,507
<i>It's been five days, and
choreography rehearsal is starting.</i>

126
00:07:58,177 --> 00:07:59,178
You're so pale.

127
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,447
It shows how I can't fully enjoy summer.

128
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:04,183
-So pale.
-I can't enjoy the summer.

129
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,554
Express those feelings
that no one else understands.

130
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:10,690
Like, "What is he doing?"

131
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:16,195
Be vague, be vague.

132
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,765
Be more spontaneous.

133
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:25,104
<i>He is going to perform this dance alone</i>

134
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:27,974
<i>on top of the wide stages of the arenas.</i>

135
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:31,677
It hurts.

136
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:40,019
<i>Meanwhile, Ueda's solo song...</i>

137
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:45,458
<i>He holds a sword
for this fighting performance.</i>

138
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:49,996
<i>And the back-up dancers...</i>

139
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,137
We will go with this style.

140
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:01,207
<i>They're dressed like revolutionaries.</i>

141
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:04,644
<i>The theme is about fighting hard.</i>

142
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,582
There are many unreasonable things,

143
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:10,883
all kinds of things,

144
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:14,253
that we are always fighting against.

145
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,154
Right?

146
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,290
It doesn't only happen to entertainers,

147
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:18,791
but to others as well.

148
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:22,128
Aren't we always
fighting against something big?

149
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:26,032
I want to make that reach
the fans and the people listening.

150
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:31,203
<i>And then, Nakamaru...</i>

151
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,471
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

152
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:35,608
NAKAMARU SOLO

153
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:40,279
<i>How will he perform
the solo song he wrote himself?</i>

154
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:45,017
<i>The ideas he came up with each day</i>

155
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:47,019
<i>jumped out in rapid succession.</i>

156
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,223
The camerawork on music shows
is complicated, right?

157
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,327
How about doing that at the concert?

158
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,296
I want to split the screen

159
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:01,734
and show it in an interesting way.

160
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:04,904
<i>And the back-up dancers?</i>

161
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:08,741
They will wear masks
and dance with them on.

162
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:10,977
Did we use a stroboscope somewhere before?

163
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:13,546
A see-through screen...

164
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,214
-Yes.
-Have we used that before?

165
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:19,752
<i>How can he use something
new and interesting?</i>

166
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:28,227
{\an8}JULY 21ST 14 DAYS UNTIL THE NATIONAL TOUR

167
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:31,731
{\an8}<i>It's two weeks before the tour starts.</i>

168
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:39,639
<i>Almost all the elements
of the concerts are ready.</i>

169
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:43,576
<i>All that's left is to fine-tune
the details for the actual concerts.</i>

170
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:49,882
<i>Nakamaru makes a new
suggestion to the members.</i>

171
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:52,918
Piano?

172
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,887
I'd like to talk about the piano.

173
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:56,322
The piano...

174
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:57,690
<i>It is Ueda's strength,</i>

175
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:01,527
<i>and he has played it
at many concerts in the past.</i>

176
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:05,064
<i>Nakamaru wants him to play the piano
along with his beatboxing.</i>

177
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,668
I'll do it if I have to,

178
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:12,338
but there's not much time left.
Really, I could only play the chorus.

179
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:18,611
Honestly, doing it perfectly
in only two weeks would be really hard.

180
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,847
That's why you don't need
to do the full song,

181
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:25,084
but you could mix in
some parts you are good at.

182
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:27,887
<i>At this point Kamenashi says...</i>

183
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:30,322
It's the same as before.

184
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:31,590
What if it wasn't...

185
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:33,626
We're always doing the same thing.

186
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,127
We have no new tricks.

187
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:38,831
<i>How can they do something new?</i>

188
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:40,433
it would be easy to do...

189
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:44,837
I have to think quickly
about what I can do.

190
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:47,973
{\an8}JULY 28TH, 7 DAYS LEFT

191
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,208
{\an8}<i>One week later.</i>

192
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:55,247
{\an8}<i>They decide that the song for the session
would be a ballad called "vivid LOVE".</i>

193
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:58,317
<i>Ueda starts practicing the piano.</i>

194
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,791
<i>Can he learn it in time?</i>

195
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:17,336
<i>And then Nakamaru
brought in a certain machine.</i>

196
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:21,707
<i>A loop machine.</i>

197
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:27,179
<i>With it, a recorded sound
can be played over and over again.</i>

198
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,986
<i>How will they use this
for their piano session?</i>

199
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:40,559
We can play with the sound
and make it vanish...

200
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:45,164
and then go on.

201
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,968
We can play with it in a fluid way.

202
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,639
We will go, "pin pin"
and the piano will go, "jan jan."

203
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:56,308
<i>But to Ueda, this idea...</i>

204
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:58,644
Really?

205
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:02,715
We could go to "vivid LOVE" without
playing the piano part first.

206
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:06,519
The essence of the piano is lost.

207
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:12,691
If I play the piano
for five or ten seconds...

208
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:15,594
<i>Ueda thinks that
the piano and loop machine</i>

209
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:19,231
<i>will drown each other out
if played at the same time.</i>

210
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:22,234
But the piano part
doesn't need to be live.

211
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:25,304
<i>The rehearsal has stopped.</i>

212
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:34,847
It's hard. Yeah, it's...

213
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,983
I don't know

214
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,152
how we should use the piano.

215
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:45,958
Getting the piano out
just to play an easy phrase...

216
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:51,297
Showing the piano will
get the audience hyped for nothing.

217
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:53,899
Since I've played
difficult things in the past.

218
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:56,869
Ueda feels that at this time,

219
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,972
he can't do it and doesn't want to.

220
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,475
But I think it's

221
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:07,213
not about doing this or that.

222
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,281
So in that sense, this time...

223
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:14,820
First, we show that Ueda can play
the piano, so people think it's amazing,

224
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:18,824
then I sing, Nakamaru beatboxes,

225
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:21,227
and then the three of us do it together.

226
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:25,130
That image, if we can show it,

227
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:28,601
and make it the main subject,

228
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:31,070
I think we should do it as
many times as we need.

229
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:33,339
Shall we try it?

230
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,209
Will the composition change?

231
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:38,177
Definitely.

232
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:39,745
The contents...

233
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:41,347
<i>Will it turn out okay?</i>

234
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:50,422
<i>The three started to move
to make the session happen.</i>

235
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:53,025
-Did you get it?
-Yes.

236
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:59,298
<i>They are testing what
the piano and loop machine</i>

237
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:00,699
<i>can do together.</i>

238
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:06,805
Try adding beatboxing, for example.

239
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:14,813
<i>How will it be if they add
someone's voice?</i>

240
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,818
Meow.

241
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:22,621
<i>They're exploring different methods.</i>

242
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,325
Once we're done with this,
we can move here.

243
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:30,763
It's not necessary
to get the piano out for "vivid LOVE."

244
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:33,032
<i>And then...</i>

245
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:57,856
It flows better like that.

246
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:22,414
{\an8}AUGUST 4TH MARINE MESSE FUKUOKA

247
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:25,050
{\an8}<i>Finally, it was the first day of the tour.</i>

248
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:30,823
<i>Fans arrive early
since it's the first show in four years.</i>

249
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,761
{\an8}<i>Twenty minutes before showtime.</i>

250
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:47,806
<i>Backstage, we find Ueda
playing the piano until the last moment.</i>

251
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:54,246
<i>The concert will start soon.</i>

252
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,350
It's the first day, so let's have fun.

253
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:00,652
It's KAT-TUN's first tour in four years.

254
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:03,455
We'll be at 23 more venues.

255
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,723
Let's do our best.

256
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:06,825
Let's go!

257
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:09,895
-Yes!
-Let's do it!

258
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:16,535
<i>A new journey is starting for KAT-TUN.</i>

259
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:21,240
<i>The members</i>

260
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:23,876
<i>come down from the ceiling.</i>

261
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:51,270
<i>The solo songs.</i>

262
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:17,863
{\an8}<i>And finally, the session
with the three together.</i>

263
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,833
{\an8}We've got a piano and some instruments

264
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:22,868
{\an8}to use with the loop machine.

265
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,216
{\an8}<i>For a few months since their restart,</i>

266
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,952
{\an8}<i>we have been following the three members.</i>

267
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:17,523
{\an8}<i>They haven't spoken much.</i>

268
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:22,828
{\an8}<i>Instead, they have expressed
themselves in front of the cameras.</i>

269
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:37,342
<i>Through filming, we learned that</i>

270
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:41,747
<i>being an entertainer
may seem glamorous at first,</i>

271
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:46,018
<i>but it is a harsh world</i>

272
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:48,854
<i>where professionals
must trust their feelings</i>

273
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:51,089
<i>and work hard.</i>

274
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:06,572
{\an8}AUGUST 29TH, NAGOYA

275
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:11,076
{\an8}<i>KAT-TUN's national tour
has arrived in the third city, Nagoya.</i>

276
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:20,152
<i>Kamenashi's routine is
to make a smoothie before a concert.</i>

277
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:23,388
With a good tempo...

278
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:24,690
Would you like some?

279
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:26,291
Would you like some?

280
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:27,259
Is that okay?

281
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:30,762
Thank you very much.

282
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,632
Did you experiment with this?

283
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:35,434
Not exactly.

284
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,135
It's very simple.

285
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,972
<i>"Would you like some?"</i>

286
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:43,709
<i>Since this documentary started filming,</i>

287
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:47,379
<i>this was the first time
Kamenashi spoke to the director.</i>

288
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,185
Let me film you drinking it.

289
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:58,590
<i>Suddenly, a relaxed smile.</i>

290
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:05,330
<i>How has he been feeling
all this time during filming?</i>

291
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:14,339
<i>The national tour ended in November.</i>

292
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:20,212
<i>In the last interview, we asked about it.</i>

293
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:23,148
Well, first of all,

294
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:31,990
because I am in the position
of being an idol,

295
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:35,560
I'm very much against
any project that shows everything.

296
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:39,931
Before going on the stage
or before going to work,

297
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,767
we need to prepare.

298
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:45,203
Those are not moments for people to see.

299
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:50,575
But we decided to do this project, so...

300
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:55,514
It would've been
different if I was smarter

301
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:59,918
and better at this kind of thing.
But for me, just because

302
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:03,322
there are cameras,
I don't think about being more fashionable

303
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,391
or making sure I'm shaved or anything.

304
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:10,462
It's not about that.

305
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:12,798
That wouldn't be a documentary.

306
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:15,467
I don't think...

307
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:19,671
it's good to expose everything,

308
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:21,006
but certainly

309
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:24,910
if my way of life was going
to be shown somehow,

310
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:28,046
well...

311
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,618
Situations that need to be exposed,

312
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,520
situations that should be exposed,

313
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:37,322
need to be shown openly.

314
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,792
-Thank you for this year.
-My pleasure.

315
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,296
Be kind when you edit this.

316
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:48,300
I haven't behaved TV-like at all.
Was it okay?

317
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:49,301
Yes.

318
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,470

00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:42,154
I was really worried then.

334
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,789
I thought I had to quit.
