1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,937
-We only have four minutes.
-Okay.

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,271
Within that time, we must

3
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:06,840
-promote Naniwa Danshi.
-Claws.

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,241
All right.

5
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:09,376
Let's go!

{\an8}JOHNNY'S COUNTDOWN 2018-2019
TOKYO DOME

7
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:16,483
{\an8}<i>This New Year's holiday,</i>

8
00:00:16,549 --> 00:00:19,919
{\an8}<i>they will be facing a moment of truth.</i>

9
00:00:22,655 --> 00:00:24,791
{\an8}We are Naniwa Danshi.

10
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:28,428
{\an8}<i>Last year, a new unit was formed</i>

11
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:31,097
{\an8}<i>out of Kansai Johnny's Jr. members</i>

12
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:32,565
{\an8}<i>called Naniwa Danshi.</i>

13
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,971
<i>Tonight, for the first time,</i>

14
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,773
<i>they fulfilled their dreams</i>

15
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:41,741
<i>of performing with their seniors.</i>

16
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:50,750
<i>Meanwhile,</i>

17
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,986
{\an8}<i>the members who stayed behind in Kansai</i>

18
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:55,588
{\an8}<i>were making new resolutions.</i>

19

{\an8}KOJI MUKAI

20
00:00:58,258 --> 00:00:59,692
When I see Naniwa on TV,

21
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:01,461
I do feel envious...

22
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,432
and motivated to work hard from tomorrow.

23
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:07,500
You have to work hard,

24
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:13,173
or you get left behind in this business.

25
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:40,400
Ride on Time<i>, a documentary series.</i>

26
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:46,005
<i>Kansai Johnny's Jr.</i>

{\an8}KANSAI JOHNNY'S JR.

30
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:00,220
<i>They have more than 50 members,</i>

31
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,155
<i>including elementary school kids.</i>

32
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:05,125
<i>Song, dance...</i>

33
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:06,192
What?

34
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:07,460
<i>...and comedy.</i>

35
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,497
<i>Anything to entertain their audience.</i>

36
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:16,536
<i>They are still young,</i>

37
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:19,572
<i>so sometimes they don't see eye to eye.</i>

38
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:23,610
Do you want to continue
as a member of Naniwa?

39
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:25,578
What are you thinking?

40
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:28,481
I don't even know
if there's a point to this.

41
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:32,085
{\an8}<i>Their seniors watched over them</i>

42
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,454
{\an8}<i>and continued to encourage them.</i>

43
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,257
{\an8}This is a team sport.

44
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:39,559
{\an8}Everything about it is.

45
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:41,694
We want to become known nationwide.

46
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:46,799
{\an8}<i>And now, it's time for their
big New Year's performances</i>

47
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,902
{\an8}<i>at Osaka-Jo Hall.</i>

48
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:52,071
<i>What will be the outcome?</i>

49
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:06,219
{\an8}<i>December...</i>

{\an8}DECEMBER 2018
OSAKA

51
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,660
<i>Their journey to Osaka-Jo Hall
has already begun,</i>

52
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:16,696
<i>and every experience
is something special to them.</i>

53
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:21,067
{\an8}Wow. We've never experienced this before.

54
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,338
<i>Believe it or not,</i>

55
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:28,675
<i>this is their very first time filming
an opening video</i>

56
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,977
<i>for a concert.</i>

57
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:39,319
<i>The one who is most grateful
for this experience</i>

58
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,387
<i>is Koji Mukai, who has been working hard</i>

59
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:45,391
{\an8}<i>as a Johnny's Jr. member ever since
he joined 12 years ago.</i>

60
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,694
{\an8}KOJI MUKAI

61
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:51,064
It's really a luxury to be able to film
an opening video.

62
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:55,068
That's a huge step
for a Johnny's Jr. member.

63
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:58,304
A huge step for Johnny's Jr.

64
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:00,673
Okay.

65
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,708
<i>This time,</i>

66
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:05,144
<i>the costumes that were prepared
for Naniwa Danshi's new song</i>

67
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:07,280
<i>are the most elaborate they've ever seen.</i>

68
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:13,286
{\an8}<i>Thinking about where Kansai Johnny's Jr.
was just the other day,</i>

69
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:15,054
{\an8}<i>it's an enormous improvement.</i>

70
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:17,590
It feels good.

71
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:22,061
{\an8}When Johnny's WEST broke off from us,

72
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:24,964
{\an8}the fans called us "burned ruins."

73
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,499
{\an8}DAIGO NISHIHATA (AGE 22)

74
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:29,769
Then Hirano and Nagase went to Tokyo.

75
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:30,803
Yeah.

76
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,573
We were called "burned ruins" back then.

77
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,708
It was a rough time.

78
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:38,845
Honestly, I don't want to lose to them.

79
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:42,882
{\an8}<i>On New Year's Day...</i>

80
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,318
{\an8}JANUARY 1ST, 2019
TWO DAYS BEFORE THE CONCERT

81
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,487
{\an8}<i>These are the final stages of practice.</i>

82
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,027
<i>Naniwa Danshi,</i>

83
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,796
<i>who just performed
in Tokyo the night before</i>

84
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:59,999
<i>at the New Year countdown concert,
came straight back.</i>

85
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:05,938
{\an8}-The one you did last year?
-Including that one.

86
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:06,973
{\an8}TADAYOSHI OHKURA

87
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,410
{\an8}<i>Ohkura and Yokoyama from Kanjani∞
also came for moral support.</i>

88
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,879
{\an8}-...it could be random.
-Okay.

89
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:15,315
{\an8}-I'll add to it later.
-Got it.

90
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:17,750
{\an8}YOU YOKOYAMA

91
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:21,954
<i>There was something that
Ohkura was concerned about.</i>

92
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:25,224
<i>That something was</i>

93
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:28,928
<i>the group of children referred to
as trainees within Johnny's Jr.</i>

94
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:31,664
<i>They lacked professionalism</i>

95
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:34,067
<i>and didn't have the choreography
memorized.</i>

96
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:37,670
-We'll stop here for a moment.
-Trainees.

97
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:40,173
-Trainees.
-Yes.

98
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:42,408
Come here.

99
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:43,843
Come here.

100
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:47,413
<i>Ohkura has gathered the trainees.</i>

101
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:50,683
You don't have to perform

102
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:52,285
if you're unmotivated.

103
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:56,622
If we're having an important conversation,
you have to listen.

104
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:57,890
Yes.

105
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,128
You're not here to make friends.

106
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,597
It's a good thing that you get along,

107
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:08,634
but I need you to take this seriously,

108
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,670
or you'll never get to hold a mic.

109
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:11,971
Yes.

110
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:14,073
Age doesn't matter here.

111
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,441
Yes.

112
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:20,413
<i>How serious are they</i>

113
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,349
<i>about working toward their goal?</i>

114
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,352
<i>He wanted them to think about it.</i>

115
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,055
{\an8}JANUARY 2ND, 2019
DAY BEFORE THE CONCERT

116
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:30,890
{\an8}<i>That's why the next day...</i>

117
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,493
I was so worked up about them,
I broke my foot.

118
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:36,662
-Yeah, right.
-Don't say that!

119
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:42,268
<i>It apparently happened the night before,</i>

120
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:45,471
<i>but he still came all the way
to the practice.</i>

121
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,412
<i>How will they respond</i>

122
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,714
<i>to the consideration he shows them?</i>

123
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:57,150
KANSAI JOHNNY'S JR.

124
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:59,886
<i>There's only one more day
until showtime.</i>

125
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:05,291
<i>Rehearsals at the actual arena have begun.</i>

126
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:10,530
<i>They are used to performing</i>

127
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:13,099
<i>in venues that seat about 1,000 people,</i>

128
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:17,336
<i>so an arena
that fits 15,000 people feels huge.</i>

129
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:22,375
Everyone please move to your positions

130
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,243
on the center stage.

131
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,516
<i>So they can entertain their fans
sitting in every corner,</i>

132
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:34,887
<i>they thoroughly check where and how
they should move.</i>

133
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:40,059
{\an8}We're going to dance here?

134
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,327
{\an8}TAKUYA NISHIMURA

135
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:42,462
{\an8}I might fall.

136
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:44,630
{\an8}-You're stupid.
-Okay, everyone.

137
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:46,999
The little kids are done for now.

138
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:50,670
KANSAI JOHNNY'S JR.

139
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:52,939
<i>They're trying out new methods.</i>

140
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:55,942
<i>A trolly, to get closer to the fans.</i>

141
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,614
-Naniwa, are you okay?
-Yes.

142
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:03,950
<i>And even their entrance...</i>

143
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:07,019
The stairs team
will go straight to the staircase.

144
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,623
<i>They all look nervous.</i>

145
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:12,358
Go.

146
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:16,662
{\an8}KAZUYA OHASHI (AGE 21)

147
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:18,231
{\an8}<i>It's hard to get the timing</i>

148
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,700
{\an8}<i>while keeping your balance.</i>

149
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:23,669
It's not funny,

150
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:26,072
-you can get hurt.
-I'm sorry.

151
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:28,074
{\an8}KENTO NAGAO (AGE 16)

152
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,576
{\an8}<i>The youngest member, Nagao,</i>

153
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,311
{\an8}<i>is looking like this.</i>

154
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,580
Go.

155
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:37,817
That was close.

156
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:41,721
-That was too early.
-Okay.

157
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,491
When coming up, you should push down.

158
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:47,226
As it rises, go like this.

159
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,794
Then you'll come up.

160
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,396
At the right timing,

161
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:51,831
jump like this.

162
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:52,899
Use the momentum.

163
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:58,638
<i>Next is the variety corner.</i>

164
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:02,942
Sorry, can you clearly state

165
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,678
that it's a tournament,
so people understand?

166
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,514
The speaking part and explanation is...

167
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:10,082
<i>Their seniors give them</i>

168
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:12,685
<i>tips on even the smallest details.</i>

169
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:16,155
When you finish that part
and move on to the next...

170
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,723
<i>However,</i>

171
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,825
<i>they can't rely on them for everything.</i>

172
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,494
Yes, let's do that.

173
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:24,897
<i>It happened when</i>

174
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:29,268
<i>they were checking the song which
the trainees will also participate in.</i>

175
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:33,873
Trainees, come on out.

176
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,474
Answer if you can hear.

177
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,810
<i>Their dancing is still unpolished.</i>

178
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:40,046
-Are you ready, trainees?
-Yes.

179
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:42,915
<i>The one who took action was Nishihata.</i>

180
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,117
You guys...

181
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:46,586
Some of the trainees

182
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:48,854
haven't memorized the dance, am I right?

183
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,257
Some of them don't have it down.

184
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,527
-You should get on it.
-Yes.

185
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,329
You'll only embarrass yourselves.

186
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:58,297
Yes.

187
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,301
<i>This was the first time</i>

188
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:05,338
<i>we've seen Nishihata speak sternly
toward the children</i>

189
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:07,974
<i>since we started filming them.</i>

190
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:14,080
<i>The atmosphere between</i>

191
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:17,116
<i>the Kansai Johnny's Jr. members
is changing.</i>

192
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:21,687
<i>Watching this situation</i>

193
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:25,391
{\an8}<i>from a different perspective was Mukai.</i>

194
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:26,626
{\an8}KOJI MUKAI

195
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:36,502
<i>He spoke about it himself, suddenly during
his New Year's visit to a shrine.</i>

196
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:40,640
I'll be working in Tokyo for the most part

197
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:43,743
from next year, so it'll be a bit sad.

198
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:47,613
How far I can make it on my own...

199
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,383
<i>This day, Mukai had already</i>

200
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:54,387
<i>decided to move to Tokyo to join a unit.</i>

201
00:10:56,889 --> 00:11:00,860
But I'm sure that my fans will support me

202
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,629
no matter where I am.

203
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,966
So I'll rely on that fact. Well, I want to

204
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:09,035
live up to their expectations.

205
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:12,805
I want to work out there too,

206
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:15,474
and hopefully have a good effect

207
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,176
on Kansai Johnny's Jr.

208
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:20,179
Takizawa Kabuki ZERO

209
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:24,083
is where I will start again.

210
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:26,585
I should tell them.

211
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,322
<i>However, Mukai still had not</i>

212
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:32,825
<i>told the other members about his decision.</i>

213
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:36,829
Happy New Year.

214
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,567
{\an8}<i>And the eldest member, Muro,</i>

215
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:44,503
{\an8}<i>also had something
he hadn't told the others.</i>

216
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:53,779
<i>Muro had decided</i>

217
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:56,949
<i>to focus on acting from now on.</i>

218
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:59,585
We'll go with that.

219
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:04,290
I will go down my own path.

220
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:08,928
As a Kansai Johnny's Jr. member,

221
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:11,163
it's likely my last time performing
at Osaka-Jo Hall.

222
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:17,470
I am a bit sad, but...

223
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:22,341
I decided that I won't cry.

224
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:26,112
I really want to make
this concert successful.

225
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:27,213
Not...

226
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,749
Not just for myself,

227
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:32,118
but for Kansai Johnny's Jr. as a whole.

228
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:35,020
Kojima's line during "Biribiri DANCE"...

229
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:37,523
<i>This is the last time</i>

230
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,425
<i>they will all perform together.</i>

231
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,029
{\an8}JANUARY 3RD, 2019
OSAKA-JO HALL

232
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,431
{\an8}<i>The day has finally come.</i>

233
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:51,737
{\an8}<i>An overwhelming number of fans
encircle the arena.</i>

234
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:54,807
Joichiro and I will...

235
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:56,575
<i>They do their final checks.</i>

236
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:57,810
I'll get off.

237
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:00,279
Stage left, stage right, center.

238
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:03,516
From stage left,
you'll go to the outer aisle.

239
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:05,151
You, from stage right.

240
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:07,486
Listen to the music
and dance like you mean it.

241
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,522
You better practice.

242
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:12,925
-There are mirrors here for that.
-Yes.

243
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:17,930
<i>The looks on the trainees' faces
have changed.</i>

244
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:23,502
<i>On the other hand, one member,</i>

245
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:27,773
{\an8}<i>Nagao, had injured his foot
during the latest rehearsal.</i>

246
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,342
{\an8}KENTO NAGAO (AGE 16)

247
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:33,412
-Can you manage to smile as you dance?
-Yes.

248
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,548
Actually, I'll be laughing more.

249
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:38,150
At how clumsy I am.

250
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:42,755
<i>Their journey, which started last autumn,</i>

251
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:44,924
<i>has made them tough.</i>

252
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,897
<i>It is almost showtime.</i>

253
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,369
All right. Are you ready?

254
00:13:57,736 --> 00:13:58,637
Daigo?

255
00:13:58,704 --> 00:13:59,605
-No, Ryuta.
-Ryuta.

256
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:00,506
-Ryuta!
-Me?

257
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:01,407
Please.

258
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:03,142
-Please.
-Okay.

259
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:05,344
It is 2019.

260
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,250
Let's show them
what Kansai Johnny's Jr.'s got!

261
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,554
Okay, let's get this started!

262
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:17,289
Yes!

263
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,325
Let's go!

264
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:22,494
All right!

265
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:25,531
<i>Finally,</i>

266
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,633
<i>the two fateful days</i>

267
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:30,302
<i>and four concerts will begin.</i>

268
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:05,204
Happy New Year!

269
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:29,028
<i>And their trademark variety corner.</i>

270
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,064
It lit up and broke in two.

271
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:33,699
What came out

272
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,568
from inside was... Ken!

273
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:39,471
Nailed it!

274
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:49,415
{\an8}<i>Kansai Johnny's Jr. aimed for</i>

275
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:53,018
<i>a performance that all the fans can enjoy,</i>

276
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:56,555
<i>in which all the members
can share the spotlight.</i>

277
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:03,028
<i>They believe that it would open up
a new path for them.</i>

278
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:06,332
It's Naniwa Danshi's new song.

279
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:08,267
We present to you,

280
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:09,835
"Diamond Smile."

281
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,235
<i>And now,</i>

282
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,871
<i>all that is left is the final show.</i>

283
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:48,941
JANUARY 4TH, FINAL SHOW

284
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,811
<i>That day...</i>

285
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:57,182
{\an8}<i>The members were told</i>

286
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:58,984
{\an8}<i>that Mukai will be moving to Tokyo.</i>

287
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:06,425
<i>This is
the last performance they will do</i>

288
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:08,594
<i>together as Kansai Johnny's Jr.</i>

289
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:10,963
The stage is yours.

290
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,865
Okay. It's our last time, after all.

291
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:14,266
{\an8}That's right.

292
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,968
{\an8}<i>Two departing members take stage.</i>

293
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:16,935
{\an8}RYUTA MURO

294
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:20,139
{\an8}Thank you for coming today, everyone.

295
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:26,745
In life, there are fun times
and tough times.

296
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:28,380
Many things happen.

297
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,783
During the tough times,

298
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:34,286
the concert we did here...

299
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:40,826
Did you have fun today?

300
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:46,465
Do you love Kansai Johnny's Jr.?

301
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:54,006
<i>Listening to their voices,</i>

302
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:56,275
<i>Nishihata was crying.</i>

303
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:04,450
<i>Friends whom he has worked with</i>

304
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:07,686
<i>to build up Kansai Johnny's Jr. together,</i>

305
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,489
<i>are starting new journeys.</i>

306
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:14,226
Well then, it's time for the last song.

307
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:16,628
Here is, "My Dreams."

308
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:25,804
{\an8}<i>"My Dreams"...</i>

309
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:29,174
{\an8}<i>A song that represents
all of the members' feelings.</i>

310
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:54,433
Okay.

311
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:56,668
Thank you.

312
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,373
Don't forget your mics, everyone.

313
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,578
<i>Doing their best to hold in
their emotions,</i>

314
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:23,181
<i>each member heads to the stage
for the encore.</i>

315
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:36,261
<i>It's time to say goodbye.</i>

316
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:38,930
Thank you so much.

317
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:42,634
<i>Muro, who'll move on
to the world of acting.</i>

318
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:44,403
How will I take this home?

319
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:47,205
<i>And Mukai,
who will start working in Tokyo.</i>

320
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:49,341
Really...

321
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:51,276
Do your best. I will do my best too.

322
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:55,480
I really love all of you. Do your best.

323
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:00,485
Cheers.

324
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:02,487
<i>Because there are goodbyes,</i>

325
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:05,090
<i>it paves way for the new era.</i>

326
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,026
{\an8}Thank you very much.

327
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:09,961
{\an8}Next time

328
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:12,364
{\an8}will be when we debut.

329
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:17,436
Until then. When we debut,
let's do a documentary.

330
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:20,005
Thank you.

331
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:28,947
{\an8}<i>And now they can enjoy
some well-earned time off.</i>

332
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:32,250
{\an8}No... I can...

333
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:35,220
{\an8}<i>Fujiwara had something he wanted to do
no matter what.</i>

334
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:39,057
<i>It's baseball.</i>

335
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:40,525
A curveball?

336
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:44,696
That's crazy!

337
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,532
Seriously? Wow...

338
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,302
{\an8}<i>One more ball.</i>

339
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,641
{\an8}<i>No matter what happens,</i>

340
00:22:56,908 --> 00:22:58,910
{\an8}<i>if you keep on running,</i>

341
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:00,746
{\an8}<i>then one day...</i>

342
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:05,384
{\an8}We are...

343
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:07,285
{\an8}Kansai Johnny's Jr.

344
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:18,363
<i>Next time on</i> Ride on Time<i>...</i>

345

{\an8}<i>Takizawa Kabuki</i>

{\an8}<i>Hideaki Takizawa's

349
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:32,444
{\an8}JOHNNY'S JR. UNIT
SNOW MAN

350
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:33,945
<i>They're burdened</i>

00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:35,680
<i>with responsibility and pressure.</i>

352
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:36,882
{\an8}It's not enough.

353
00:23:36,948 --> 00:23:38,383
{\an8}I can't show this to people.

354
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:40,752
This is definitely crazy.

355
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:42,888

356
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:47,058
{\an8}<i>Their resolve to stand on stage
will be tested.</i>

357
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:50,929

that even Takizawa didn't imagine.

358
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:55,066
<i>In the world of entertainment,</i>

359
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:58,103
<i>will they be able
to dance and spread their wings?</i>

360
00:23:58,904 --> 00:23:59,838
{\an8}PREPARE FOR A NEW BEGINNING
