THE POWER OF ADVERSITY

2
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:10,176
<i>Do you know of these idols?</i>

3
00:00:12,912 --> 00:00:14,981
Hello, we're Kansai Johnny's Jr.

4
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:17,617
Let's have some fun!

5
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:23,757
{\an8}KANSAI JOHNNY'S JR.

6
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:26,860
{\an8}<i>They are all the rage
in the Kansai region,</i>

7
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:28,828
{\an8}<i>Kansai Johnny's Jr.</i>

8
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:34,434
<i>They may not be well-known
on a national level yet,</i>

9
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:37,937
<i>but to become the new stars
of the idol world,</i>

10
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:41,374
<i>on New Year's they are about to take up
a make-it-or-break-it challenge.</i>

11
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:47,047
Are you having fun?

12
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:49,716
Make some noise!

13
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:50,850
{\an8}JOICHIRO FUJIWARA (AGE 23)

14
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,485
{\an8}It may be my last chance.

15
00:00:52,952 --> 00:00:54,954
{\an8}I felt that I've renewed my determination

16
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:58,691
{\an8}to keep walking down this road
that I've chosen.

17
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:23,550
<i>This is documentary series</i> Ride On Time.

18
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,588
OSAKA

19
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:33,860
<i>It's not an easy feat to become
a national idol group from Osaka.</i>

20
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,133
{\an8}<i>In 2004, Kanjani∞ debuted,</i>

21
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:46,739
{\an8}<i>and then ten years later in 2014,
Johnny's WEST debuted.</i>

22
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,074
{\an8}<i>It's been five years.</i>

23
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,278
{\an8}Okay, get a little closer together.

24
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:56,282
{\an8}<i>Despite that, last year
a new star was born in Osaka.</i>

25
00:01:57,484 --> 00:02:00,787
<i>Seven were chosen out of
Kansai Johnny's Jr.</i>

26
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:03,456
<i>to create a unit called Naniwa Danshi.</i>

27
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:07,594
<i>They were quietly reaffirming
their determination to debut.</i>

28
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:14,834
{\an8}The creation of Naniwa Danshi
was a breath of fresh air.

of Kansai Johnny's Jr.

31
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,476
{\an8}<i>At the end of the year
they'll be performing...</i>

32
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:27,480
{\an8}<i>at the legendary Osaka Shochikuza Theatre.</i>

1 MONTH, 35 PERFORMANCES

34
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:32,785
{\an8}<i>Then at the start of the new year,</i>

35
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:35,255
{\an8}<i>they'll be at Osaka-Jo Hall
for two consecutive days.</i>

36
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:38,925
{\an8}<i>They will entertain approximately
100,000 people in total.</i>

{\an8}OSAKA-JO HALL
2 DAYS, 4 PERFORMANCES

38
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:47,433
{\an8}<i>A total of about 50 members
from Kansai Johnny's Jr.</i>

39
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,069
{\an8}<i>will perform with them this time.</i>

40
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:59,012
<i>Singing and dancing
are not all they have going for them.</i>

41
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,953
<i>Some dedicate themselves
to playing instruments...</i>

42
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,526
<i>and others to comedy.</i>

43
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:16,296
A large knife!

44
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:19,032
Not a large knife.

45
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:23,870
<i>Among them are innocent
elementary school kids.</i>

46
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:25,705
Hyokkori-han.

47
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:27,640
I'm ten years old.

48
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:29,075
I'm nine years old.

49
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:30,510
It died.

50
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:33,479
<i>As a team,
they stand on stage as professionals.</i>

51
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,983
<i>And that is why they go through
strict training.</i>

52
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:40,220
-You have to practice.
-Yes.

53
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:42,422
This is bad. If you can't memorize it,

54
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:44,424
you can't be a Johnny's Jr. member.

55
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:45,325
Yes.

56
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,359
Let's work hard.

57
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:51,297
<i>This time, they have
some reliable helpers.</i>

58
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:57,270
{\an8}<i>Their seniors from Kansai Johnny's Jr.,
Kanjani∞'s Tadayoshi Ohkura</i>

59
00:03:57,337 --> 00:04:01,708
{\an8}<i>and You Yokoyama, have volunteered
to direct the composition and production.</i>

60
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:05,478
Naniwa Danshi may have been created,

61
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:10,216
but there are so many more
amazing talents here.

62
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:13,319
Thinking about what we can do

63
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,856
to make those talents shine

64
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,459
is our job right now, I think.

65
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:25,465
<i>Will they succeed at
having the performance of their dreams?</i>

66
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,671
Nice to meet you!
We are Kansai Johnny's Jr.!

67
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:33,072
Viva!

{\an8}NOVEMBER 2018
OSAKA

69
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:44,984
{\an8}<i>It's early November,
and their first day of rehearsals.</i>

70
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:48,354
-Morning.
-Morning.

71
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:51,958
<i>As we film the members walking in...</i>

72
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:54,594
<i>all of a sudden...</i>

73
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:56,696
{\an8}I'll do a party stunt!

74
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:59,499
{\an8}I'll make a kanji character with my body.

75
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:00,566
{\an8}The word for "dirt."

76
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:02,669
Dirt!

77
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,138
Thank you.

78
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,939
Don't do it out of the blue!

79
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:08,141
Who made you do it?

80
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:09,475
Who made him do it?

81
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:12,445
<i>It's an expression
of their love to entertain.</i>

82
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:15,348
Good morning.

83
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:22,522
<i>On this day, Naniwa Danshi
and other central members</i>

84
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:26,092
<i>have come together to talk about
the end-of-year performances.</i>

85
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:35,735
<i>There is a reason why
the members are nervously waiting.</i>

86
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,107
Good morning.

87
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:47,280
{\an8}<i>Ohkura from Kanjani∞
is joining in on the meeting too.</i>

88
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:52,185
{\an8}TADAYOSHI OHKURA

89
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,121
For the Christmas medley,

90
00:05:55,188 --> 00:06:00,326
I was thinking of doing it like a show.

91
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:01,994
Whatever song you're doing,

92
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,764
I don't know how much
the fans will understand,

93
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:07,500
but you should start raising your game.

94
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,971
<i>That was when the frontman,</i>

95
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,606
<i>Daigo Nishihata, spoke up.</i>

96
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,509
I want to give the spotlight
to the little kids.

97
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:18,144
Rather than me.

98
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:20,713
Like in ANOTHER?

99
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:24,217
<i>What members will they choose,
and what songs will they sing?</i>

100
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:26,352
<i>Amid everyone's ideas,</i>

101
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:31,090
<i>Nishihata has been put in charge of doing
a collaboration with the children.</i>

102
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:33,993
{\an8}Interacting with them...

103
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,229
{\an8}It's fine if it's part of
the choreography,

104
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:38,631
{\an8}but going up to them while singing

105
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:41,534
{\an8}and doing things like this
becomes really tiring.

106
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:45,271
Just being with the kids is tiring.

107
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:47,640
Yeah.

108
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:50,042
You should treat it like it's your solo.

109
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:51,477
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

110
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:56,215
<i>As someone who knows the difficulties,
Ohkura gives him advice,</i>

111
00:06:56,549 --> 00:07:00,386
<i>but Nishihata still wants to
focus on the children.</i>

112
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:06,459
Rather than a solo, I was thinking about

113
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:09,529
prioritizing the kids during the song.

114
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,898
More than making it my solo.

115
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,633
So Daigo,

116
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,169
you want to support the younger kids

117
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:18,271
who just joined?

118
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:19,071
Yes.

119
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,708
You want to nurture them?

120
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,213
<i>Creating a performance
where everyone can shine.</i>

121
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,316
<i>That is Nishihata's wish.</i>

122
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:37,423
<i>Now, let's introduce the remaining members
of Naniwa Danshi.</i>

123
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,397
{\an8}<i>The leader, with his countertenor voice,</i>

124
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:45,865
{\an8}<i>is Kazuya Ohashi.</i>

125
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:47,500
{\an8}KAZUYA OHASHI (AGE 21)

126
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,208
-This.
-Yes, I can.

127
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:56,542
I can sing that.

128
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:01,714
{\an8}<i>The oldest member, Joichiro Fujiwara,</i>

129
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:04,617
{\an8}<i>is the gray eminence of Naniwa Danshi.</i>

130
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:08,621
{\an8}JOICHIRO FUJIWARA (AGE 23)

131
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:09,789
{\an8}KYOHEI TAKAHASHI (AGE 18)

132
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:14,327
{\an8}<i>The tall and handsome Kyohei Takahashi
and Shunsuke Michieda.</i>

133
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:15,194
{\an8}SHUNSUKE MICHIEDA (AGE 16)

134
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:18,030
{\an8}<i>These two joined Kansai Johnny's Jr.
four years ago,</i>

135
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:20,967
{\an8}<i>and were chosen to join Naniwa Danshi.</i>

136
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,672
Is your voice still changing?

137
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:29,375
I don't know.

138
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:30,810
Is it done?

139
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:31,711
Maybe.

140
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:38,050
{\an8}<i>And the mild-mannered classic idol types,</i>

141
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:41,587
{\an8}<i>Kento Nagao and Ryusei Onishi.</i>

142
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:44,056
{\an8}<i>They didn't expect to be chosen.</i>

143
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:45,491
{\an8}RYUSEI ONISHI (AGE 17)

144
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:46,492
I got a message

145
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,094
from our manager saying

146
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,597
they made Naniwa Danshi, a Kansai unit.

147
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:55,501
It had all the members written down,
but I thought it was a prank at first.

148
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:57,503
I asked them what it was about,

149
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,039
and they said, "the message explains it."

150
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:01,908
It wasn't a prank.

151
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:03,843
Now that we've become a unit,

152
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,913
the seven of us can work hard together,
so it's reassuring.

153
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,615
More people will come to know us.

154
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,051
It's a huge chance.

155
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,321
<i>For these members,</i>

156
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:19,191
<i>Ohkura spends all the time he can
giving them advice.</i>

157
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:21,894
<i>What is on his mind?</i>

158
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:25,431
During the interlude, for example.

159
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:31,771
There are so many kids here
with such potential and talent.

160
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:33,539
But...

161
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,009
I feel like they're being overshadowed.

162
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,379
I'm sure they've felt isolated.

163
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:43,382
Each of them must have felt anxious

164
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,751
and probably still do right now.

165
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,554
But they don't know what to do.

166
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:50,990
When I was a Johnny's Jr. member,

167
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:52,625
before I was in Kanjani∞,

168
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:55,061
I wasn't in any unit.

169
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:59,966
And I didn't have anyone
I could get advice from.

170
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,970
When I think about how they've been
in that situation this whole time,

171
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:09,141
it makes me want to help them
in any way I can.

172
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:12,345
Who have I not met?

173
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:13,980
-Me.
-Me.

174
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:17,817
<i>Not wanting their fellow teammates
to feel isolated.</i>

175
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:21,053
<i>Nishihata feels the same way as Ohkura.</i>

176
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:24,824
-What's your name?
-Ryusei Ida.

177
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,158
-Ida?
-Ryusei.

178
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:27,193
-Ryusei?
-Yes.

179
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:29,895
Like a dragon?

180
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:32,798
<i>Holding on to big dreams,</i>

181
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:34,734
<i>these children gather here.</i>

182
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:42,208
<i>Many of the idols
who are in the limelight now,</i>

183
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,845
<i>including himself,
have all gone down this road.</i>

184
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:53,586
<i>If possible, he wants them to feel
like they have a chance.</i>

185
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:58,991
Work hard on the dance routine.

186
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:03,829
{\an8}<i>Nishihata joined the agency
when he was 14 years old.</i>

187
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:14,140
{\an8}<i>He was in a unit with Ren Nagase,
who is currently in King & Prince,</i>

188
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:15,941
{\an8}<i>and they worked hard together.</i>

189
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:20,012
{\an8}REN NAGASE

190
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:22,982
<i>He kept his nose to the grindstone</i>

191
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:26,986
<i>and seized opportunities,
like appearing in dramas by himself.</i>

192
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:32,358
Good morning.

193
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,660
<i>To meet for our interview,</i>

194
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,430
<i>Nishihata has come by subway.</i>

195
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:38,664
Let's go.

196
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,234
Let's go.

197
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:43,803
How do you usually travel?

198
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:45,938
I use the train.

199
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,708
Pretty much all Johnny's Jr. members
commute by train.

200
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:56,315
<i>Nishihata has one wish.</i>

201
00:11:57,016 --> 00:12:00,252
<i>That is for all
the Kansai Johnny's Jr. members</i>

202
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:02,321
<i>to become famous.</i>

203
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:07,059
<i>That's what he believes his own role
within Naniwa Danshi to be.</i>

204
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:11,664
One day, I'd like to be

205
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:17,570
like ARASHI and Kanjani∞,

206
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:20,740
where no matter who becomes the frontman,
the group still shines.

207
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:24,510
That's the kind of group that I want
Naniwa Danshi to become.

208
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:28,414
I don't mean that I'm not cut out
to be the frontman,

209
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:32,752
it's just that would make us stronger.

210
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:34,854
It's not easy to make a group

211
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:40,893
that can shine
no matter who the frontman is.

212
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:43,562
All of us need to become famous

213
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:47,066
and be qualified as frontmen.

214
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,403
Not that I'm famous or anything.

215
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,605
I'm not at all.

216
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:57,877
<i>Mid-November.</i>

217
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:07,153
<i>As the performance nears,
the rehearsals become more rigorous.</i>

218
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:10,122
<i>Each member is honing their own skills.</i>

219
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,963
<i>Some of those are unique.</i>

220
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,904
<i>During free time in between rehearsals,
this member is studying.</i>

221
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:28,874
<i>While studying economics
at a national university,</i>

222
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:31,210
<i>he's also active as a Johnny's Jr. member.</i>

223
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:36,048
There are idols who do news shows, right?

224
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:39,218
I want to focus on that area.

225
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:42,121
We don't have anyone like that right now.

226
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:44,790
So I wanted to assume that position.

227
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:46,458
TAISEI FUKUMOTO

228
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:50,563
<i>And demonstrating
precise dance moves here</i>

229
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:55,334
<i>is the group of older members
who are the pillars of Kansai Johnny's Jr.</i>

230
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,172
<i>On top of their own performances,</i>

231
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:02,374
<i>their job is to rev up the crowd</i>

232
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,910
<i>as backup dancers for the younger ones.</i>

233
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:11,050
No, that's no good. It's too fast.

234
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:14,253
We danced behind
the younger generations too.

235
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:15,721
-Really?
-Yes.

236
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,523
Right?

237
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:20,392
I was a backup dancer for WEST.

238
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:21,694
For Johnny's WEST?

239
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,195
They're younger?

240
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:24,129
A few of them.

241
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:25,598
That's how it is here.

242
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:27,533
Understood.

243
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,667
It doesn't matter.

244
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:29,802
That's right.

245
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,070
<i>It's a tough world.</i>

246
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:35,441
<i>But despite that fact,
helping each other out</i>

247
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:36,842
<i>is part of their tradition.</i>

248
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:39,712
{\an8}<i>MAIDO! JOHNNY</i> FILMING

249
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:43,816
{\an8}<i>That was clearly eminent during
this day's TV show filming.</i>

250
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:50,322
{\an8}<i>The two who support the members
who are less experienced</i>

251
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:53,459
{\an8}<i>with their excellent conversation skills</i>

252
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:57,363
{\an8}<i>are Koji Mukai and
the eldest member, Ryuta Muro.</i>

253
00:14:57,429 --> 00:15:00,266
{\an8}RYUTA MURO, KOJI MUKAI

254
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:03,535
{\an8}If someone tries to do
something funny and fails...

255
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:05,304
{\an8}RYUTO MURO

256
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:07,606
{\an8}I want to be able to save the situation.

257
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:10,476
I want to help everyone, you know?

258
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:16,015
I want to,
because people did the same for me

259
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:19,451
when I was small.

260
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:21,820
You're making fun of me.

261
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:22,988
I can feel it.

262
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:24,990
Your monologue almost made me cry.

263
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:25,858
You liar.

264
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:27,559
{\an8}Good luck.

265
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:28,494
{\an8}KOJI MUKAI

266
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,397
{\an8}<i>On the other hand,
Mukai is the caring type.</i>

267
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,367
Kyohei is always
fixing his hair like this.

268
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,302
{\an8}KYOHEI TAKAHASHI (AGE 18)

269
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:37,403
{\an8}-Right?
-Yes.

270
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:40,506
{\an8}-You do it the most out of everyone.
-Yeah.

271
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:42,308
{\an8}Good luck.

272
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,276
When are you going?

273
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:47,613
When are you going to go?

274
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,049
<i>They almost seem like brothers.</i>

275
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:57,122
Johnny's members get costumes
with their names placed on top, like this.

276
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:58,757
Right now, it's Mukai's, but...

277
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:00,125
We've all done this.

278
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:02,494
Inohara!

279
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:08,167
Like that, new names are placed on top.

280
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,770
So everyone goes,
"Whose costume was it?!"

281
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:14,039
"It was Yamashita's!"

282
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:16,275
That happens a lot.

283
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:18,610
-Big bro!
-You work at a nightclub?

284
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:19,845
Looks like it, right?

285
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:21,914
<i>There may be a big age gap,</i>

286
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:23,849
<i>but they're a team.</i>

287
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,218
Big bro.

288
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:29,455
-Big bro!
-Big bro! So cute.

289
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:31,256
You're so cute, Big Bro.

290
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:36,795
<i>In this tough business
where there's no promise of success,</i>

291
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:38,897
<i>they support each other.</i>

292
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:47,306
<i>The feeling that they all share
is expressed</i>

293
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,308
<i>in a song written by their senior.</i>

294
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:20,092
{\an8}<i>Numazu City, Shizuoka Prefecture.</i>

295
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:25,597
{\an8}<i>Nishihata is on the film set
for a drama series</i>

296
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:28,000
{\an8}<i>in which he is appearing on his own.</i>

297
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,703
{\an8}<i>He uses any opportunity he can get</i>

298
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:36,875
<i>to make Kansai Johnny's Jr. and
Naniwa Danshi nationwide household names.</i>

299
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:45,017
<i>He is playing the role of a Tokyo student
who studies animal behavior, but...</i>

300
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,219
When did you start liking ants?

301
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:52,758
Relaying interesting facts
is fun, isn't it?

302
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,827
Fix your intonation.

303
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:58,330
"Relaying interesting facts."

304
00:19:58,397 --> 00:19:59,598
"Interesting facts"...

305
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,868
"Relaying interesting facts."

306
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,536
"Interesting facts."

307
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:06,104
"Interesting facts."

308
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:10,309
<i>He can't help but say things
with a Kansai intonation.</i>

309
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:15,714
Another time, when I was in a movie,

310
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:17,683
I had to say, "culture festival".

311
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:20,586
My intonation for that was different too.

312
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:24,690
In standard Japanese,
it goes down after the first syllable,

313
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:27,826
but in the Kansai dialect, it goes up.

314
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,661
But then...

315
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:34,333
When I'm on set for a long time,
I get used to standard Japanese.

316
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:38,303
So, when I go back home to Osaka,

317
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:41,974
standard Japanese comes out sometimes
unintentionally,

318
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:47,179
and they call me gross
and tainted and whatnot.

319
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,847
It's tough.

320
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,016
So tough.

321
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:57,656
<i>Even in between scenes,
he practices his dance routine.</i>

322
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:06,331
If people come to know me,

323
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:08,600
then Kansai Johnny's Jr.,

324
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:12,971
and now the unit Naniwa Danshi,
will also become known.

325
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:18,110
So, I need to be the vanguard
and promote them.

326
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:21,513
I hope that I can get people
at least a little bit interested

327
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,884
in Kansai Johnny's Jr. and Naniwa Danshi.

328
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:32,391
<i>With preparations for the end-of-year
performances underway,</i>

329
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:35,560
<i>today, they are practicing
their variety corner.</i>

330
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:43,669
{\an8}<i>It will be directed by
You Yokoyama from Kanjani∞.</i>

331
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:44,936
{\an8}YOU YOKOYAMA

332
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:48,106
Do you want to run through it once?

333
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,643
Do whatever part you can.

334
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:53,078
Okay.

335
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:54,780
You can go off script.

336
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:55,681
Okay.

337
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:57,416
What about...

338
00:21:57,683 --> 00:21:58,717
It's here.

339
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:01,320
<i>Naniwa Danshi's opponent...</i>

340
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:04,890
Hey, wait a second!

341
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:09,828
<i>...is a group of unique individuals
led by Mukai.</i>

342
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:12,197
-It has to be us.
