<i>This is what they had to say on the size
of this chance that's come their way.</i>

18
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:36,229
A few years ago, I would really never
have believed a day like this would come.

19
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:38,231
Wow, I'm nervous.

20
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:41,201
-You've gone white.
-I'm so nervous.

21
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:45,371
<i>Feelings like this were unavoidable.</i>

22
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:50,009
I want Snow Man
to be everywhere this year.

<i>To make sure the show is a success,</i>

34
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:34,487
<i>they are going to have to
break out of their shells.</i>

35
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:39,559
<i>I guarantee you, this is insane.</i>

36
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,230
<i>I might have them coughing up blood
by the end.</i>

37
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,538
<i>Every day leading up to New Year's

-The weather predictor.
-Forecaster.

59
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,913
-It's "forecaster"?
-I'm a forecaster.

{\an8}DAISUKE SAKUMA (AGE 26)

73
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,891
So, we're not using the full-body shot?

74
00:04:54,327 --> 00:05:00,500
<i>Takizawa has already described his vision
for Snow Man to the staff.</i>

75
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,337
Succession is one of the themes,

76
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:07,974
with Snow Man taking up the mantle
from Takizawa.

77
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:13,012
The show is a form of traditional
Japanese entertainment.

78
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:17,417
So the six of you will be modeled
in the likeness of cherry blossoms,

79
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:23,323
as this is a story in which Snow Man
will become cherry blossom petals.

80
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:28,261
<i>Now Sakuma changes into
his blossom-inspired costume.</i>

81
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:31,130
The legs aren't too long?

82
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:32,699
No, they should be fine.

83
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,703
<i>Even by the standards
of the acrobatic Snow Man,</i>

84
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:39,238
<i>he possesses exceptional athletic ability.</i>

85
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:44,744
Incredible!

86
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:49,182
Form a bridge with your body in the air.

87
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,122
-This is amazing!
-It is.

88
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,991
It's beautiful.

89
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:00,960
Brilliant!

90
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:05,732
<i>Embodying cherry blossoms,
Snow Man flutters in the air.</i>

91
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:13,172
<i>Takizawa has this to say
on the sentiment behind it all.</i>

92
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:17,410
With Snow Man as cherry blossoms,

93
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:20,680
though cherry blossoms are thought of
as falling and scattering,

94
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:24,083
we want to go for a floating look
rather than a falling one.

95
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:28,688
To be honest,
Snow Man isn't quite there yet.

96
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:34,627
But I think that they have
a certain charm about them

97
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:37,230
that makes you want to give it
everything you've got.

98
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:42,101
That's why I, the fans,
and all of the staff behind the scenes

99
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,670
want to do what we can
to make them bigger.

100
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:49,509
I believe they have something
that engenders that feeling.

101
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:54,113
<i>Can they live up to this expectation?</i>

102
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:02,255
{\an8}<i>Today, Takizawa is at
Osaka Shochikuza Theatre.</i>

103

{\an8}DECEMBER 2018
OSAKA SHOCHIKUZA THEATRE

104
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:10,062
<i>There's a reason
he's made the long trip to Osaka.</i>

105
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:15,101
-Good morning!
-Good morning.

106
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:16,936
{\an8}-Hello.
-Hello, sir.

107
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:20,573
{\an8}<i>He's visiting the Kansai Johnny's Jr.
training room.</i>

108
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:29,816
<i>He's decided that they will also
be performing in the upcoming show.</i>

109
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:36,456
<i>However, traditional performing arts
are entirely new to most of them.</i>

110
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,466
<i>Nevertheless,</i>

111
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:50,403
<i>Takizawa has decided to devote this year
to the development of the next generation,</i>

112
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:54,874
<i>and he hopes they will grasp the basics
of traditional performance.</i>

113
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:08,488
<i>To achieve that, he intends to have
members of Kansai Johnny's Jr.</i>

114
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:12,592
<i>perform in a single scene
of the Kabuki show.</i>

115
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,763
-Hamamatsuya would be possible.
-Yes.

116
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:22,568
If we went that route, I would feel uneasy
about the Kansai boys

117
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,303
doing Hamamatsuya alone.

118
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,772
-You feel that way? Right.
-I'm afraid so.

119
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,242
-I'm not sure―
-Okura recommended it.

120
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:34,080
Did he? What about the acting aspect
of the show?

121
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:37,383
-We've hardly done it.
-Right.

122
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,553
-Right, let's get them to do it.
-"Let's get them to do it"?

123
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,522
-It'll be fine.
-Let's do it, then.

124
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:45,324
-We'll give it our best shot.
-Let's get them to do it then.

125
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:48,794
-They'll have to do it sooner or later.
-That's true.

126
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:53,900
{\an8}-Good morning.
-Good morning.

127
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,401
{\an8}<i>January.</i>

128
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:59,672
{\an8}<i>The full training for</i> Takizawa Kabuki ZERO

129
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:06,546
<i>There's around three weeks until
their first day at Minamiza in Kyoto.</i>

130
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,581
<i>Snow Man is naturally here,</i>

131
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:11,984
<i>along with Kansai and Kanto Johnny's Jr.,
dancers and more.</i>

132
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:15,154
<i>They're all working together as one
to master the performance.</i>

133
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:23,829
Takizawa Kabuki
<i>calls for singing and dancing,</i>

134
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:26,265
<i>as well as sword fighting and drumming.</i>

135
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:30,670
<i>There's even acting with Kabuki elements,
making for a variety-filled program.</i>

136
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:36,342
<i>The choreography is completely new, too.</i>

137
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,878
<i>Even Snow Man,
who's trained for past shows,</i>

138
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:41,180
<i>have to learn everything from scratch.</i>

139
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:44,684
First, your hip goes up. Your bottom.

140
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,219
Your shoulder's on the floor
right now, yes?

141
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:50,690
Follow your belly button.
That's it, that's it.

142
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,225
<i>And there's more.</i>

143
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,427
Let's do it.

144
00:09:54,493 --> 00:09:56,228
Do what?

145
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:57,830
Do...?

146
00:09:57,964 --> 00:10:01,267
<i>This pose involves supporting
your body weight with the neck.</i>

147
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:04,837
This position is
the most beautiful of all.

148
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,711
<i>They try performing in time to the music.</i>

149
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:29,195
<i>They may have confidence
in their endurance,</i>

150
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:32,064
<i>but they're exhausted
right from the start.</i>

151
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:39,972
-Let's take a 45-minute break.
-Okay.

152
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,609
All right! Come on!

153
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:47,380
She's making us jump a bit too much.

154
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:49,315
-It's our first day of training.
-Yes.

155
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:50,750
It's unprecedented.

156
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:55,988
We'd normally have a month
at the very least to learn.

157
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:58,924
But we only have about three weeks
for this.

158
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,727
And what's more,
it's basically a new version.

159
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:04,397
The whole program is different.

160
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,534
<i>The crew are also short on time.</i>

161
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:13,239
{\an8}<i>In the next room, they're holding
a meeting regarding the costumes.</i>

162
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:21,514
{\an8}<i>Present along with Takizawa is Miyadate,
who is contributing to the costume design.</i>

163
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:24,283
{\an8}<i>The goal is to gain experience.</i>

164
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:29,689
<i>For the closing performance
of the first act,</i>

165
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:35,194
<i>an idea for a flash change from
white to color costumes has been proposed.</i>

166
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:39,632
It's not about making them colorful,

167
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:44,804
but rather that these colorless kids
have attained color.

168
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:49,909
Expressing the individuality they attain
through dance and costume

169
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:52,545
has been the concept from the very start.

170
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,281
-Is what I'm trying to say.
-Right!

171
00:11:57,016 --> 00:12:00,586
I'll have to leave it with you,
or it will never get done.

172
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,588
Really?

173
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:08,961
<i>If he doesn't take an active role,
the crew won't take him seriously.</i>

174
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:12,531
So, you're joining in with the costumes?

175
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:14,934
Yes. At the designing stage.

176
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,470
-For costume planning we were about to...
-Right.

177
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:19,939
So the things we talked to
Takizawa about before,

178
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:21,640
we should talk with you about now?

179
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:23,442
Yes, from now on.

180
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:26,612
-Suddenly trying to take this on...
-It takes years of experience.

181
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,481
There's Johnny's Jr., too.

182
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:30,816
-So that's what you want?
-We can do that.

183
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:35,688
I'll get into that now.

184
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:37,857
-Good luck!
-Thank you.

185
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,860
I wanted to learn,

186
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:43,863
and I really like costumes and clothes.

187
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:50,202
Takizawa used to direct, produce,
decide the costumes and perform onstage.

188
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:56,242
He's trusted me with part of that,
so I have to give it my all.

189
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:00,045
We have time. Let's do it.

190
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:05,184
<i>They'll be playing the leading roles.</i>

191
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:08,888
{\an8}RYOTA MIYADATE

192
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:12,057
{\an8}When we were told we had to begin
from the perspective

193
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,660
{\an8}of being the stars of the show,

194
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:16,962
I thought,
we haven't learned anything yet.

195
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:20,933
We've only ever been hiding at the back.

196
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:26,906
We don't have nearly enough pulling power
to be standing at the front yet.

197
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,374
That's how I felt.

198
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:33,779
<i>It's only due to this development
that the road ahead of them has opened up.</i>

199
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:36,682
{\an8}I want to overcome being unknown.

200
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:38,050
{\an8}I want people to know us.

201
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:41,153
{\an8}I want them to know this show,
and to know Snow Man.

202
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,222
{\an8}DAISUKE SAKUMA

203
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,492
-Good work, everyone!
-Good work!

204
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,994
<i>Behind these words</i>

205
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,797
<i>is hidden a bitter experience
from last year.</i>

206
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:58,170
{\an8}<i>Just before rehearsals began,
they performed</i>

207
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,239
{\an8}<i>in a traditional Johnny's show.</i>

208
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:05,010
Johnnys' Island.

209
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:08,714
{\an8}Welcome to <i>Johnnys' King & Prince Island</i>.

210
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:11,450
{\an8}Relax and enjoy the show!

211
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:17,790
<i>The stars of the show were a group
who made their debut last year</i>

212
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:22,094
<i>and shot to stardom overnight,
King & Prince.</i>

213
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:28,400
<i>Dancing behind them</i>

214
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,536
<i>were their seniors, Snow Man.</i>

215
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:39,144
{\an8}While part of me was just happy for them,
as I should be,

216
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:44,350
{\an8}I also felt a great deal of frustration.

217
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:48,487
It made me question what I was doing.

218
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:53,592
I was 25, which is the age people start
wondering why you're still a Junior.

219
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:59,164
They made their debut,
then went another step higher than that.

220
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:03,936
I'm always thinking about
wanting to debut.

221
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:10,509
<i>Iwamoto threw himself into dance
from childhood,</i>

222
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,978
<i>and signed up with the agency at 13</i>

223
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,981
<i>with the goal of making a name for himself
in the future.</i>

224
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:22,688
<i>While his contemporary Juniors
debuted one after another,</i>

225
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:26,792
<i>he eagerly searched for something
only he could do.</i>

226
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:31,797
<i>One of the answers he found was this.</i>

227
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,667
My elbows will never extend like this.

228
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:36,835
Because I'm pushing my shoulder blades in.

229
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:41,573
Then I lower it and push it up.
Like I'm squeezing my chest.

230
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:46,111
<i>He started sculpting his body in earnest
three years ago.</i>

231
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:54,453
<i>So he can give his best performance
no matter what the job calls for,</i>

232
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,355
<i>he's trained to be in top form.</i>

233
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,962
CHEST TRAINING METHODS

234
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:06,966
<i>He's come as far as to have his own
regular article in a magazine.</i>

235
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:16,976
<i>The heavy responsibility
previously shouldered by Takizawa alone</i>

236
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:20,579
<i>is being picked up by Snow Man,
who has watched how he does it.</i>

237
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,817
<i>They consider teamwork
to be more important than anything.</i>

238
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:31,824
This is true for every performance
and every scene.

239
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,792
Even with the scenes you're not in,

240
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,364
you have to think about how you can
join them together in an interesting way.

241
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:42,267
You need to have invisible teamwork.

242
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:45,304
Invisible words.

243
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,873
And mental fortitude.

244
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:51,777
If there was a word like "hunger,"

245
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:57,082
but two or three levels above it,
I'd use that to describe the feeling.

246
00:16:57,449 --> 00:17:00,219
-So "hunger" doesn't do it justice?
-No, it doesn't.

247
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:06,058
<i>On that same day,</i>

248
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:09,194
<i>one of Iwamoto's seniors
reached out to him.</i>

249
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:13,432
I tell people there's this great guy
called Iwamoto.

250
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:18,137
{\an8}<i>From TOKIO, Taichi Kokubun.</i>

251
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:24,376
<i>Iwamoto is appearing as a guest
on his radio show today.</i>

252
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:28,180
Wait a minute, are you kneeling?

253
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,716
Stop it, you can't film that!

254
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,452
People will think I made you do that!

255
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:36,655
No, it's nothing like that.
I didn't want to talk from up here,

256
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,625
-so I came down to your level.
-Sit down!

257
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:45,431
<i>With Snow Man now responsible
for the major</i> Takizawa Kabuki<i>,</i>

258
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:47,499
<i>Kokubun has this advice for them.</i>

259
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,304
The <i>Takizawa Kabuki</i> name
may still be there,

260
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:55,007
but since Snow Man
is the top-billed star,

261
00:17:55,307 --> 00:18:01,013
I think you should consider the implied
name of the show to be <i>Snow Man Kabuki</i>.

262
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:06,385
Things like wanting to surpass Tackey
or wanting to look after Tackey's baby...

263
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:09,421
I don't believe you need
to think like that.

264
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:13,892
It's more important to not forget
to be what makes you who you are.

265
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:17,262
-As if I know it all!
-No, thank you.

266
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:20,499
-I'm thrilled to be on Taichi's show.
-Not at all.

267
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:25,404
{\an8}<i>From Hideaki Takizawa to Snow Man.</i>

268
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:29,808
{\an8}<i>They're keenly aware of the weight
of this responsibility.</i>

269
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,545
-That's a game you can't lose.
-It is.

270
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:37,182
-Good morning!
-Good morning!

271
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:39,852
<i>Taiko-drumming practice begins today.</i>

272
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:43,155
FIRST DAY OF TAIKO PRACTICE

273
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:54,766
<i>As with the dance choreography, the taiko
rhythms have been completely revamped.</i>

274
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:59,938
Don, don, don, don, dodon,
daka-daka-dan.

275
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:03,075
<i>Furthermore,
the rhythm is only taught to them orally.</i>

276
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:05,911
<i>There's no choice
but to pound it into muscle memory.</i>

277
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:21,426
I'm lost now.

278
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,829
Only Hikaru can remember it.

279
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:25,531
I'm the only one who's drumming!

280
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:37,042
<i>This part of the show has come so far
as to be a</i> Takizawa Kabuki <i>highlight.</i>

281
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:41,280
Oh no!

282
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:43,749
This is bad.

283
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:49,388
<i>They drum continuously in a position
that strains their abdominal muscles.</i>

284
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,491
<i>Its nickname? Taiko sit-ups.</i>

285
00:19:57,162 --> 00:19:59,331
<i>Iwamoto looks cool and composed.</i>

286
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:09,675
<i>But as for the other group members?</i>

287
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,279
<i>They're already reaching their limits.</i>

288
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:22,087
My stomach's on fire. It feels good.

289
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:29,928
<i>Shota Watanabe is really beginning
to feel it in his arms.</i>

290
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:34,333
{\an8}-I don't normally use my abs like that.
-The sequence got longer?

291
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:38,837
{\an8}The drumming phrases always stayed
the same year to year,

292
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:42,674
but they've come up with
all-new ones this year.

293
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:45,644
I have to sit up at the right times.

294
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:47,446
To shout at the right time.

295
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:52,351
There are all these things to consider
while getting the drumming right.

296
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:57,923
So, I need to make sure I memorize all
the phrases each day or I'll fall behind.

297
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:00,859
There's not much
breathing space this time!

298
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:08,834
<i>And it was at this moment
that a big change came along for Snow Man.</i>

299
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:12,838
I think we can do it.

300
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,373
It looks like we can.

301
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:20,145
<i>Three new band members
have joined Snow Man.</i>

302
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,783
{\an8}<i>Still in junior high and 15 years old,</i>

303
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,885
{\an8}<i>is Raul.</i>

304
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,420
{\an8}RAUL (AGE 15)

305
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:30,255
{\an8}REN MEGURO (AGE 22)

306
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:32,324
{\an8}<i>A member of another unit,</i>

307
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:35,994
{\an8}<i>who'll simultaneously be part of Snow Man,
is Ren Meguro.</i>

308
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:38,563
I don't know!

309
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,799
<i>And there's one more.</i>

310
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,401
I don't know, Abe.

311
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,469
-Let's do it, then.
-Thank you.

312
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:50,008
{\an8}<i>Having officially made the move from
Kansai Johnny's Jr. to Snow Man,</i>

313
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:51,977
{\an8}<i>is Koji Mukai.</i>

314
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:00,485
<i>He can sing and dance, of course,</i>

315
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:02,554
<i>but is also a great talker.</i>

316
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:04,923
<i>He even hosts TV shows regularly.</i>

317
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:09,461
<i>To the rest of Kansai Johnny's Jr.,
he was a big brother of sorts.</i>

318
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:14,266
<i>Before the taiko sit-ups,</i>

319
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:16,101
<i>Mukai had these big words to say.</i>

320
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:20,105
I can drum for one, two, even three hours.

321
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:23,208
Taiko was the most fun last time.

322
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,344
-Really?
-Yes. It's brutal.

323
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:27,546
I look good when I'm suffering.

324
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:29,314
That's what I thought as I did it.

325
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:32,184
<i>Perhaps this cheerfulness is required.</i>

326
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,021
<i>But despite all of that,</i>

<i>he's in an unfamiliar environment
as the performance date looms,</i>

328
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,461
<i>and he needs to learn
the choreographed moves.</i>

329
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:48,934
<i>The pressure slowly mounts.</i>

330
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:56,441
-Are you okay?
-More or less.

331
00:22:57,008 --> 00:22:58,710
Everyone's so fast.

332
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:06,785
<i>With the new members joining their ranks,
they're a reborn Snow Man.</i>

333
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:09,955
<i>As the start
of</i> Takizawa Kabuki ZERO <i>approaches,</i>

334
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:13,725
<i>how will they climb over the high wall
standing before them?</i>

335
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:18,630
{\an8}<i>On the next</i> Ride On Time<i>,</i>

336
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:22,768
{\an8}<i>some struggle as the training
gets more and more intense.</i>

337
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:26,104
{\an8}There's no time to rest now.

338
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:27,239
{\an8}It's tough.

339
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:28,974
{\an8}Big smiles!

340
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:33,512
{\an8}<i>Meanwhile, the new additions
to the group are publicly announced.</i>

341
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:37,048
{\an8}If we don't keep taking the next
one or two steps up

342
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:41,353
{\an8}to the next level from where are now,

{\an8}We're a new Snow Man.

345
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:53,565

<i>As the first show approaches,
can Snow Man solidify their unity?</i>
