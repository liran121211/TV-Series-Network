{\an8}DECEMBER 31, 2018
OSAKA KYOCERA DOME

2
00:00:03,336 --> 00:00:06,006
{\an8}<i>On New Year's Eve in 2018,</i>

3
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:08,975
{\an8}<i>over 50,000 NEWS fans</i>

4
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:11,277
{\an8}<i>came from all over Japan.</i>

5
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:17,684
{\an8}<i>They filled the Kyocera Dome.</i>

6
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:20,687
{\an8}Hello!

7
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:23,990
{\an8}<i>For NEWS, which is celebrating
its 15th anniversary,</i>

8
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:25,658
{\an8}<i>this is their first...</i>

9
00:00:25,725 --> 00:00:26,626
{\an8}TAKAHISA MASUDA (AGE 32)

10
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,361
{\an8}<i>...solo countdown concert.</i>

11
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:32,198
{\an8}KEIICHIRO KOYAMA (AGE 34)

12
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:34,634
Let's get this started!

13
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,002
All right!

14
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:42,409
{\an8}We're so glad to be spending
the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019

15
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:45,211
with all you lovely people,
who have always been there for us.

16
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:48,181
-All right! Here we go!
-Yeah!

17
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:49,149
Let's work hard.

18
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:55,288
<i>They've reached the end of the year.</i>

19
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:20,213
<i>This is documentary series</i> Ride On Time.

20
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:43,303
<i>The countdown concert
approaches with every second.</i>

21
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:50,210
{\an8}<i>NEWS will be singing over 40 songs
during this concert.</i>

22
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:59,052
<i>On this day, Tegoshi was rehearsing
the entire song list by himself</i>

23
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,821
<i>without the other members.</i>

24
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:05,758
<i>Pretending it's a real concert,</i>

25
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:08,862
<i>he sings and dances
without taking any breaks.</i>

26
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:28,515
It's what we do at the actual concert.

27
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:31,985
So I have to do a real
run through beforehand,

28
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:33,520
to see what it's like.

29
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,556
Because if we're up on the stage,
and we're wheezing,

30
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:39,626
it'll look so lame.
Since it's our job to be pop idols.

31
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:42,095
If the song list that we have now

32
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:43,796
is too hard to complete,

33
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,499
I'll go out and run. Outside, at night.

34
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:50,069
<i>That day,</i>

35
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,506
<i>he rehearsed and checked everything
until he was satisfied.</i>

36
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:55,275
<i>His solo rehearsal</i>

37
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:57,477
<i>lasted for four hours.</i>

38
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:05,218
<i>Meanwhile, there were still
things to discuss about the concert.</i>

39
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:08,788
<i>At this meeting, the topic of discussion</i>

40
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:12,225
<i>was the video footage
which would appear during the song.</i>

41
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:15,762
It's the font, right? As usual?

42
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:17,897
It does make a difference.

43
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:19,365
Depending on the color

44
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:21,034
and the design.

45
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:25,905
{\an8}<i>There are various types of fonts.</i>

46
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:28,908
{\an8}<i>Why is this important to Kato?</i>

47
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:31,544
{\an8}Words are one way

48
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:33,346
{\an8}to express an atmosphere.

49
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:37,016
{\an8}The cool visuals help to create
that world and deliver the lyrics.

50
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:40,186
{\an8}That way, the fans can enjoy
both the sound and visual.

51
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:43,256
<i>He checks some text samples</i>

52
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:45,658
<i>of the lyrics that the staff made.</i>

53
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:50,396
{\an8}<i>This is a gothic style font.</i>

54
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,174
{\an8}<i>The next one is Mincho style.</i>

55
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,712
{\an8}Mincho style is cooler,

56
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:07,480
{\an8}for this song at least.

57
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:13,119
<i>It's an important way
to convey what the song means.</i>

58
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,822
<i>He can't cut corners.</i>

59
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:20,560
{\an8}<i>Three more days until New Year's Eve.</i>

60
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,862
{\an8}<i>The costumes are coming along.</i>

61
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:31,104
<i>Four new costumes
were made for this concert.</i>

62
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:33,473
<i>The costume fitting begins.</i>

63
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:40,146
<i>This purple coat is for the opening song.</i>

64
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:44,517
<i>The important thing
is how it looks when all four members</i>

65
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:46,085
<i>go up on stage.</i>

66
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:50,223
Maybe I'll add some stripes to the collar.

67
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:52,892
The neckline is looking a little...

68
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,294
This here?

69
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:58,064
<i>To make changes to their costumes,</i>

70
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:01,668
<i>decorations are added
to Kato and Tegoshi's sleeves.</i>

71
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:03,636
<i>And...</i>

72
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:07,240
<i>Masuda feels Koyama's neckline
is also looking bare.</i>

73
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,375
Will you have a necklace on?

74
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:11,311
Well... not really.

75
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,314
<i>Then...</i>

76
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,983
I was thinking about this chain.

77
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,686
-Can you try this on as a necklace?
-Sure.

78
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,691
How is it?

79
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:26,826
It does look better.

80
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:30,229
If you don't like that,
we can add something else to your costume.

81
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:32,131
Yeah. I probably won't wear this.

82
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,770
<i>How do the members feel about
the costumes that Masuda makes?</i>

83
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:42,008
He's always thinking about

84
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:45,345
how the costumes
can make each member look his best.

85
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:48,981
If a highly experienced stylist
or designer were to make them,

86
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:52,051
they might be
of higher quality and look nice,

87
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:54,520
but the costumes
wouldn't be made with love.

88
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:56,956
That's something only he can do.

89
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:02,195
{\an8}<i>December 30th, 2018 at Kyocera Dome.</i>

90
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:03,262
{\an8}Good morning.

91
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:05,231
{\an8}<i>It's the day before the countdown concert.</i>

92
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:09,836
<i>The members arrive at Kyocera Dome.</i>

93
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,173
Good morning.

94
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:19,312
<i>This is the first rehearsal
using the actual stage</i>

95
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,847
<i>that they will be performing on.</i>

96
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:26,652
<i>Each member corrects
whatever he feels needs to be fixed.</i>

97
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:34,560
Can the Johnny's Jr. members
come in from a different place?

98
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:40,566
<i>Meanwhile,
in the dressing room backstage...</i>

99
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:52,612
<i>Three sewing machines
were brought in to modify the costumes.</i>

100
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:02,555
<i>It's 11:00 p.m. at night.</i>

101
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:07,226
<i>After eight hours of rehearsing,
Masuda comes in.</i>

102
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,629
<i>Then...</i>

103
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,033
What type of buttons do you have for this?

104
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:15,902
-A button?
-Yeah.

105
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:22,241
<i>He suggests adding gold buttons
to the purple coat.</i>

106
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:24,744
Doesn't that look nice?

107
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,089
It looks weird if there aren't any here.

108
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:39,992
-So should we put it on both sides?
-That would be good.

109
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:41,461
So...

110
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:43,429
<i>They decided to put gold buttons</i>

111
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:46,065
<i>on both sides of the zipper.</i>

112
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,438
{\an8}<i>This is the costume
for their new song, Spirit.</i>

113
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:55,975
If we write something on this,
it'll look better.

114
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:57,276
How about "Spirit?"

115
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:01,380
<i>After saying that,
he heads out of the room.</i>

116
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:04,984
-Can I borrow this?
-Sure.

117
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:09,188
<i>He borrowed a permanent marker.</i>

118
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:10,490
See you tomorrow.

119
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:12,692
-I found it.
-Wow.

120
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:20,967
<i>He starts to write something,
on the leather patch.</i>

121
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:30,409
<i>On Kato's costume,
he even wrote Kato's birth date.</i>

122
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,382
<i>He works diligently on small details</i>

123
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:39,151
<i>that the audience may not notice.</i>

124
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:44,223
<i>He believes
that there is a meaning behind all of it.</i>

125
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:49,595
It's so cute.

126
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:58,371
<i>It's finally
the day of the countdown concert.</i>

127
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:01,474
DECEMBER 31, 2018
DAY OF THE COUNTDOWN CONCERT

128
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:05,378
{\an8}<i>It's 12 hours until the concert starts,</i>

129
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:08,514
{\an8}<i>but the costumes
were still being modified.</i>

130
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:09,415
{\an8}TEN A.M.

131
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:11,617
<i>There are 15 costume staff,</i>

132
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:15,187
<i>including those
who help with the fitting.</i>

133
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,290
<i>Will they be finished on time?</i>

134
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:19,792
{\an8}We're cutting it close.

135
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:20,760
{\an8}YUYA YONEYAMA

136
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:24,030
-Will Masuda be coming by to check again?
-I think so.

137
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,566
-He's coming in now.
-Good morning.

138
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,402
Oh, thank you.

139
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:30,736
I got some extras too.

140
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:32,972
There are 15 in total here.

141
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:35,107
There are 15 people here, right?

142
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,544
-Thank you.
-Please share cups if there aren't enough.

143
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,280
Thank you so much.

144
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:43,849
He's always so considerate.

145
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:47,086
He doesn't need to do this.
We're just doing our jobs.

146
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:51,490
<i>The modifications on the coats</i>

147
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:56,195
<i>for their opening song
were finishing up quickly.</i>

148
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:00,466
<i>This is the completed costume.</i>

149
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:04,971
<i>There are gold buttons from the waist up,</i>

150
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:07,807
<i>and decorations were added to the collar.</i>

151
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:14,013
{\an8}<i>The collar has two different designs,
used to create contrast</i>

152
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:15,982
{\an8}<i>when all four members stand
next to each other.</i>

{\an8}<i>it's their first countdown concert

00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:37,236
<i>The venue is filled
with over 50,000 fans.</i>

159
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,743
Let's get this started!

160
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,244
All right!

161
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:49,181
We're so glad to be spending
the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019

162
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:54,286
with all you lovely people,
who have always been there for us.

163
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:57,223
-All right! Here we go!
-Yeah!

164
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:58,924
Let's work hard.

165
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,430
<i>The moment has finally arrived.</i>

166
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:15,301
We want to hear all of your voices!

167
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:17,703
Let's be one!

168
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:28,147
{\an8}<i>It's the third song into the concert.</i>

169
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,717
{\an8}<i>At that moment Masuda...</i>

170
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:19,565
{\an8}<i>These costumes</i>

171
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:23,769
{\an8}<i>are the concert sweatshirts
that they had redesigned.</i>

172
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:36,682
{\an8}<i>This is the costume
that Masuda put his whole soul into.</i>

173
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:06,812
{\an8}<i>And as for Kato, who searched for
the perfect font</i>

174
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,515
{\an8}<i>and design for the lyrics...</i>

175
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:35,941
<i>It's finally the countdown.</i>

176
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:38,544
Three! Two! One!

177
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:39,845
Happy New Year!

178
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:44,783
Happy New Year!

179
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,722
Happy New Year!

180
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:51,156
Happy New Year!

181
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:57,129
But you know, isn't it amazing that NEWS
got to perform a countdown concert?

182
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:59,398
It's amazing. We're so blessed.

183
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:01,800
Thank you so much everyone.

184
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:03,135
We're so blessed.

185
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:05,571
I get why Masuda got overwhelmed
with emotions.

186
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:07,439
That was fast.

187
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,575
What are you talking about?

188
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:11,744
Don't tell me you forgot.

189
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:22,254
{\an8}<i>They've spent 15 years together.</i>

190
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:27,159
<i>Each member carries
his own memories in his heart.</i>

191
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:33,032
<i>Then, they sing this song.</i>

192
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,168
{\an8}<i>"Ikiro".</i>

193
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:35,314
Happy New Year!

194
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,324
-Thank you, everyone.
-Good work!

195
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:49,394
Let's do a review.

196
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:51,563
Thanks so much.

197
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:55,367
-Did your tears say it all?
-I didn't cry.

198
00:18:58,003 --> 00:18:58,971
Was it emotional?

199
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:01,740
Yeah, it made me happy.

200
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,677
Takahisa Masuda is a crybaby.

201
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:07,079
He said he wasn't crying.

202
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,182
No, no. He cries like this...

203
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:13,652
That's how it looks to us.

204
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:17,589
We gave the best performance
that we could give at this moment.

205
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,491
Our songs weren't perfect,

206
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:22,661
and our performance
or our dancing wasn't perfect either.

207
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:24,530
Nothing was perfect.

208
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:28,433
But in terms of what NEWS
and the NEWS fans can do,

209
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,203
to put on a great concert,

210
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:33,972
I feel like we gave the best one so far.

211
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:37,509
After seeing you guys
under the spotlight, I realized that

212
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:39,611
you guys really are pop idols.

213
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:41,480
-Did you?
-I'm glad.

214
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:42,648
Glad to hear that.

215
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:46,985
I hate to say it
but being a pop idol is amazing.

216
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,655
That's why we have to work harder.

217
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:51,623
Is it fun being a pop idol?

218
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,392
-Well yeah, we love it.
-Yeah.

219
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:54,626
Or you won't last.

220
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,529
I think people who choose
to be idols are crazy.

221
00:19:58,497 --> 00:19:59,865
I am, and you are, too.

222
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,467
You can blow a kiss on a whim, right?

223
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:05,437
That's not a normal thing to do
for a guy over 30.

224
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:08,240
But you'll continue doing it?

225
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:10,108
-Of course.
-Of course.

226
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:12,211
It was a good way to end the year,

227
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:15,314
and it gave us a new resolve
to start fresh,

228
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:17,049
as pop idols once again.

239
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:10,035
...a year where everything changed.

240
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:14,640
{\an8}<i>Their thoughts and emotions
of what happened in that one year.</i>

{\an8}JANUARY 17, 2017

242
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:18,777
Since I debuted,
I have wanted to give it my all.

243
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:21,446
Because we hit rock bottom,
there's nothing to fear.

244
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,615
I think I used up
a lifetime's worth of tears.

245
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,451
I want to follow the path
that I believe in.

246
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:29,354
That's how determined I am.

performance on Kohaku.</i>

248

We're excited, but nervous
at the same time.

249
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,096
I'll do my best in the Kid's Corner.

250

{\an8}<i>And we will feature
the Kansai Johnny's Jr. member</i>
