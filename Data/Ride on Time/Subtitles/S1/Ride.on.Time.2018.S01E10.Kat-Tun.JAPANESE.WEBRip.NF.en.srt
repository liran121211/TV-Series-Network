1
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:05,271
<i>After two years, they've come back.</i>

2
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:10,710
{\an8}<i>The return of KAT-TUN.</i>

3
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:14,014
{\an8}<i>They carry one feeling in their hearts.</i>

4
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:18,885
{\an8}It's a way to show my resolve
to the members who left.

5
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:21,421
And I guess we also have our pride.

6
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:25,258
And the fans.

7
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:50,750
<i>This is documentary series</i> Ride On Time.

00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:58,224
{\an8}2006 KAT-TUN DEBUT LIVE
TOKYO DOME

9
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:01,428
{\an8}<i>Their big debut came in 2006
when they performed</i>

10
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:04,264
{\an8}<i>to a full audience at Tokyo Dome.</i>

11
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,266
{\an8}DEBUT SINGLE SOLD 1,046,000 COPIES

12
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:09,402
{\an8}<i>Their steady rise shocked the world.</i>

13
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:18,311
{\an8}<i>Their charm was in their wildness
which was far from the typical idol image.</i>

14
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,181
Hey, Dome!

15
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:25,318
Scream until you can't anymore!

16
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:28,154
Make some noise, you bastards!

17
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:33,560
<i>However, they had very
different personalities,</i>

18
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:35,995
<i>so the group faced many challenges.</i>

19
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,199
{\an8}<i>For various reasons,</i>

20
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,900
{\an8}<i>one member left after another.</i>

21
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:45,105
{\an8}<i>They had doubts about
continuing with the group.</i>

22
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:50,210
{\an8}<i>But as a result...</i>

23
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,345
{\an8}2016 10TH ANNIVERSARY LIVE
TOKYO DOME

24
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:54,614
{\an8}<i>...their bond became stronger.</i>

25
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:02,122
{\an8}All three members are necessary,

26
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:04,991
{\an8}and I think the moment that changes,
we won't be KAT-TUN.

27
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:07,660
{\an8}After all the difficult things
we went through,

28
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:11,698
{\an8}I want the three of us
to find happiness together.

29
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,869
<i>And they confronted Tokyo Dome</i>

30
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:18,004
<i>for the first time in two years.</i>

31
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:20,140
{\an8}<i>Each of them</i>

32
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:22,942
{\an8}<i>has their own feelings within them.</i>

33
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:30,917
{\an8}<i>February.</i>

34
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,719
{\an8}FEBRUARY 23RD, 2018

35
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:34,487
Thank you.

36
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:38,758
<i>On this day, the meetings about
the Tokyo Dome concerts have started.</i>

37
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:46,766
<i>We catch a glimpse of what they each
wish to value the most moving forward.</i>

38
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:52,539
I'd like to push this sort of 1-1-1 image

39
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:55,975
for this year's concerts.

40
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:59,779
I think we should look back at the work

41
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:03,550
each of us did during
the recharging period.

42
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:05,251
-I remember talking about that.
-Yes.

43
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:08,121
Wouldn't it be nice to show
each of our personalities?

44
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:10,890
<i>Even as a group,</i>

45
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:13,326
<i>they still care about their individuality.</i>

46
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,600
<i>They even keep to themselves
during the breaks.</i>

47
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,204
<i>Nakamaru is writing something.</i>

48
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,675
<i>Ueda is checking the stage.</i>

49
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:33,613
<i>Kamenashi is reading about pro baseball.</i>

50
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,120
<i>They also learn
the choreography separately.</i>

51
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,660
<i>They don't exchange words.</i>

52
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:54,567
<i>We ask the staff around them</i>

53
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:59,005
<i>and they tell us how KAT-TUN
is different from other groups.</i>

54
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:06,746
In the past, KAT-TUN used to
practice dancing in sync.

55
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:09,882
But they were told, "Don't dance in sync!"

56
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:12,352
"Don't destroy what makes you good."

57
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:14,554
The messy look is their charm.

58
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:18,024
They are cool because each of them
is completely different.

59
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,760
It's 100 times harder
to make a cool dance like that.

60
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,630
They feel the responsibility of
having to look cool

61
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:26,933
even though they're not in sync.
So, their individuality grew.

62
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,535
And that is their distinct color.

63
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:33,973
Every group has individuality. Probably.

64
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:39,679
But, well, we were taught that way,

65
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:41,748
and were told we had something good.

66
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,617
That "something" is big.

67
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:48,688
{\an8}<i>On this day,</i>

68
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:51,591
{\an8}<i>Nakamaru shot a video
by himself for the concerts.</i>

69
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,763
Good morning.

70
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:58,131
Good morning.

71
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:01,467
-You're a mess.
-Yes, indeed.

72
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,202
<i>Looking like this,</i>

73
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:06,973
<i>he is going to shoot a video
to showcase the concert's merchandise.</i>

74
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,176
Can I check it out?

75
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,546
<i>He is not only going to introduce it,</i>

76
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:17,317
<i>he also wants the fans to have
fun with the video.</i>

77
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:22,455
Okay.

78
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:25,725
<i>The top items this time</i>

79
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:29,062
<i>are bath salts that Nakamaru
produced himself.</i>

80
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:33,966
<i>They come in each of the member's colors.</i>

81
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,336
<i>He also drew the illustrations himself.</i>

82
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,173
I want to review it.

83
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:44,911
Knock, knock, knock.
Let me out! Let me out!

84
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:47,880
I'm trapped.

85
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:49,782
I've been trapped for two years!

86
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:51,484
Damn it!

87
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:54,220
<i>Inspired by home shopping
channel infomercials,</i>

88
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:56,622
<i>he wrote the script from scratch himself.</i>

89
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:57,657
Who's in there?

90
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,392
Start the camera.

91
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:02,295
<i>The filming starts.</i>

92
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,830
It's ready, go.

93
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:06,065
Hey! Let me out!

94
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,434
I'm serious, let me out!

95
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:09,869
It's been too long!

96
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:13,139
I've been trapped.

97
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:16,909
I've been trapped here for two years!

98
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:21,781
That three-person pirate group,
KAT-TUN, is terrible!

99
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:23,549
Especially Kamenashi and Ueda!

100
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:27,653
Because... they grabbed me by the arms.

101
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:30,423
And now it's torn.

102
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:35,027
<i>How will this showcase the bath salts?</i>

103
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:37,463
<i>Let's take a look at the finished result.</i>

104
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:42,034
{\an8}I'm tired! I want to take a bath.

105
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:45,438
{\an8}Ah!

106
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:46,773
{\an8}This is what you need!

107
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:49,542
{\an8}KAT-TUN's hot bath for a rapid recharging!

108
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:50,910
These bath salts are amazing!

109
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:54,614
Even those with fatigue
can be quickly recharged.

110
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:57,383
{\an8}Ah, my fatigue has melted away!

111
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,520
For this special occasion,

112
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:03,890
{\an8}it comes in the three colors of
the members and the price is only

113
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,291
{\an8}600 yen.

114
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,427
Please consider it!

115
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,462
<i>You want to kill me?</i>

116
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:13,032
<i>For an intense KAT-TUN concert,</i>

117
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,201
<i>this can be a good highlight.</i>

118
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:18,671
<i>I'm tired! I want to take a bath!</i>

119
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,440
You're having fun?

120
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:25,445
Having fun is the most important thing.

121
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,184
I thought that it would be better
to have this kind of angle.

122
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:33,219
Yeah.

123
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,956
Because I think it's good
to have diversity in concerts.

124
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:40,626
So, I think it's good to
have a funny part like this.

125
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:46,332
{\an8}<i>Nakamaru was born in 1983</i>

126
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:50,136
{\an8}<i>as the eldest of three</i>

127
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:53,439
{\an8}<i>to a father who was
a strict civil servant.</i>

128
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:57,910
<i>When he was little, he was naughty.</i>

129
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,880
<i>He was often scolded
because he couldn't keep quiet.</i>

130
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:06,619
<i>He joined the agency when he was 14.</i>

131
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:10,189
<i>Since he was one of hundreds
of aspiring idols,</i>

132
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:15,528
<i>he thought of a plan to get his big break.</i>

133
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:21,667
Since there were 100 or 200
members in Johnny's Jr.,

134
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:23,703
I thought of how to stand out.

135
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:28,007
I looked at the others who were chosen

136
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:30,343
to be part of Johnny's & Associates, Inc.

137
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:32,278
I looked...

138
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,514
I looked into the periods
when they debuted.

139
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:39,151
I looked into why
they were chosen and so on.

140
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:42,889
"The next member will be chosen soon."

141
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:46,092
"We will be called
for this or that reason."

142
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:48,261
Those are things that I kept in mind

143
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:51,197
as I tried to follow the trends,
so I would also be chosen.

144
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:52,765
Also, my parents told me

145
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:57,336
that if I wanted to be an entertainer,
I'd have to have at least one skill.

146
00:08:57,637 --> 00:09:00,873
So, I had thought for a long time

147
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,209
that I needed to learn something.

148
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:06,245
Because being a member of Johnny's Jr.

149
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:09,081
has its risks.

150
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:12,285
It's a world where you don't know
whether they'll choose you or not.

151
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:18,391
I was stressed about it every day.
I was that competitive.

152
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:23,963
{\an8}<i>And this is what he found.</i>

153
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:29,168
{\an8}BEATBOXING:

154
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,404
{\an8}REPRODUCING THE SOUND OF
PERCUSSION INSTRUMENTS

155
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,639
{\an8}WITH ONLY THE MOUTH AND TONGUE

156
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:49,422
<i>He practiced with the metronome
every day until his tongue hurt.</i>

157
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,595
{\an8}<i>And there's one more thing.</i>

158
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:58,497
{\an8}<i>To survive in show business,</i>

159
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:02,568
{\an8}<i>he has one rule for himself
on the film sets.</i>

160
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:09,108
<i>And that rule is this.</i>

161
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:12,445
That's okay.

162
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:14,113
I don't need it.

163
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,482
It's not necessary.

164
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,485
-You don't sit down?
-I don't.

165
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,754
Only if it's an emergency.

166
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,358
I have to be careful.

167
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:28,027
They offer chairs out of kindness,

168
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:33,466
but if people see me sitting without any
context, they'll think I'm arrogant.

169
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:36,035
I can't carelessly sit.

170
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:39,639
It's a trap.

171
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:45,244
But the person who gave you
the chair will feel bad...

172
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:49,148
I'm thankful for it,
but there are people who don't know.

173
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:52,785
"He feels important sitting there..."

174
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:57,556
But they know that staff and artists are
different, so they wouldn't think that.

175
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:01,927
-I would think that.
-How petty.

176
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:08,901
Isn't sitting back while being fanned
and having your sweat wiped off terrible?

177
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:11,070
-That would be bad.
-Right?

178
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,775
{\an8}Ready... start!

179
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:19,311
{\an8}<i>On the other hand,
Ueda has his own way of living.</i>

180
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:24,583
<i>His role in today's filming</i>

181
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,652
<i>is a cook at a ramen shop.</i>

182
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,557
You are doing great. Let me see.

183
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,094
This is perfect.

184
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:40,833
<i>Even when praised,
he doesn't stop until he is satisfied.</i>

185
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:42,935
Ready...

186
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:45,471
<i>He is the type who dives into things.</i>

187
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:51,944
-I did it.
-Well done.

188
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:58,818
{\an8}<i>Ueda was born in 1983 in Yokohama.</i>

189
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:04,290
{\an8}<i>Due to his father's work,
he moved a lot when he was little.</i>

190
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:10,529
<i>He joined the agency on his own at 14.</i>

191
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:13,232
<i>But he had a hard time fitting in,</i>

192
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:18,204
<i>and dreamed of making it as a soloist,
instead of being part of a group.</i>

193
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,006
I hate being around people.

194
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:24,410
It's not that I hate it...

195
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,047
How should I say it?

196
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:30,349
I hate noisy crowds.

197
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,952
Like when there are lots of people.

198
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:38,090
I also don't like it when we have
to go everywhere together.

199
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:44,263
<i>But the agency made him join KAT-TUN.</i>

200
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:49,568
<i>Since Ueda liked to be alone, the friction
with his surroundings didn't go away.</i>

201
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:53,205
TATSUYA UEDA

202
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:59,211
<i>But as one member left after another,</i>

203
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:03,783
<i>he unexpectedly started to deepen
his bond with the others.</i>

204
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,824
{\an8}<i>During their recharging period,
he used his sports program</i>

205
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:16,195
{\an8}<i>to help support boys
who have yet to debut.</i>

206
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:21,834
{\an8}<i>On this day, Ueda's
Johnny's Track and Field Club</i>

207
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:25,070
{\an8}<i>have a relay race against
the para-athlete team.</i>

208
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,405
{\an8}Do your best.

209
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:31,143
Since the athletes this time
are amazing...

210
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,045
I want you to enjoy it.

211
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,447
-Don't be nervous.
-Okay!

212
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,819
Come on!

213
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:42,721
I've made a 180-degree change

214
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:46,058
from when I was put in KAT-TUN
before we got our big break

215
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,593
to my current self.

216
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,263
We have reduced the number
of members by half now.

217
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:55,768
After overcoming those things with
the members at those times,

218
00:13:56,869 --> 00:14:00,739
it's like our unity is stronger now.

219
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:04,510
I really do think that
sharing difficult experiences...

220
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:07,813
makes our bond stronger.

221
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,915
It's the same love as family.

222
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:13,118
We've spent more time with each other
than our families.

223
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:16,989
It's not only love,

224
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:19,925
we also irritate each other.

225
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:21,026
But...

226
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:23,796
How do I say it?

227
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:29,001
After all we've overcome together,
I think it's good being just us three.

228
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:32,538
That kind of love.
Like, no matter what happens,

229
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:34,440
in the end you love them.

230
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,842
No matter what happens...

231
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:39,678
After all the difficult things
we went through,

232
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:43,515
I want the three of us to find
happiness together.

233
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:50,890
{\an8}<i>They're headed to Tokyo Dome
for the first time in two years.</i>

234
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:53,893
{\an8}APRIL 19TH, DAY BEFORE CONCERT
TOKYO DOME

235
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:58,130
<i>In this huge venue,</i>

236
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:00,599
<i>how will these three members</i>

237
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:03,302
<i>be able to entertain the fans?</i>

238
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:11,477
<i>The highlight of Kamenashi's part
is this aerial performance.</i>

239
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:15,748
Be careful.

240
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:21,854
<i>He holds his entire weight
with his right arm,</i>

241
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,289
<i>so it's a big burden.</i>

242
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:32,164
{\an8}<i>Ueda will take a drive on a motorcycle
between the audience seats.</i>

243
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:38,337
<i>He wants to be as close
as possible to the fans.</i>

244
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:48,547
<i>As expected, Nakamaru has a unique idea.</i>

245
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:55,220
<i>He has a miniature set of the stage
and shows it on the screen.</i>

246
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:59,258
<i>He is acting out what will happen
in the second half of the concert.</i>

247
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:06,865
...the amount of feathers. Also,

248
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:12,271
it would probably be better
if the front of the <i>uchiwa</i> is visible.

249
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,741
Like that.

250
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,344
Like that.

251
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:23,282
<i>Without relying on the latest technology,</i>

252
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:27,720
<i>he is thinking about how to make it
have a realistic feeling for the audience.</i>

253
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:36,428
<i>Kamenashi quietly watches the screen</i>

254
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:39,164
<i>where that rehearsal is being shown.</i>

255
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:45,204
<i>They want to make their
passion reach the audience.</i>

256
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:48,907
<i>That is the determination
of all the members.</i>

257
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:51,110
It's like...

258
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:54,113
what it means to be an idol...

259
00:16:55,881 --> 00:17:00,352
I want to value myself as an artist
and the things that I experience.

260
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:05,557
I'm the type of person
who prefers talking face-to-face

261
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,028
rather than discussing
things over e-mail.

262
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:14,366
Like when we meet up or have concerts.

263
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:21,774
That's something I really want to value.

264
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:26,145
{\an8}<i>April 20th.</i>

265
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:28,280
{\an8}APRIL 20TH
FIRST CONCERT SINCE THEIR RETURN

266
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:33,385
<i>Since morning, the outside
has been packed with fans</i>

267
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:35,487
<i>who have been waiting for their return.</i>

268
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:41,093
<i>There are even fans from overseas.</i>

269
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:43,829
HONG KONG

270
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:50,235
My right arm is not good.

271
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:54,640
It takes a lot of energy.

272
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:57,543
<i>It's a passionate performance.</i>

273
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,712
<i>The price of that is not small.</i>

274
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:10,122
<i>Finally, the three days of concerts
is about to start.</i>

275
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,093
<i>Will they be able</i>

276
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,297
<i>to deliver a satisfying performance
to the fans who've been waiting so long?</i>

277
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:22,701
Can I get some eye drops?

278
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,770
<i>The moment has finally come.</i>

279
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,872
2 MINUTES TO SHOWTIME

280
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:33,378
<i>They have been on
the Tokyo-Dome stage many times.</i>

281
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,950
<i>Even so, they are nervous.</i>

282
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:47,426
It's been two years, and these are
going to be three important days.

283
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:52,197
Let's give it our all today.
I'm counting on you.

284
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:54,833
Let's go!

285
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:01,073
{\an8}SHOWTIME

286
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,274
{\an8}<i>It begins.</i>

287
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,793
<i>Tokyo Dome is filled with 55,000 fans</i>

288
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:26,098
<i>who have been waiting for
the three of them to appear</i>

289
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,400
<i>since the last song they sang
two years ago.</i>

290
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:54,620
<i>The members' solo parts.</i>

291
00:21:56,415 --> 00:22:00,585
<i>The concerts lasted for three hours
with a total of 36 songs.</i>

292
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:04,423
<i>For three days,
they will continue with all their might.</i>

293
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:14,132
<i>Their fans wave their hands
at the three of them until the end.</i>

294
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:19,071
Because they exist,
we can continue moving.

295
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:22,441
I can't just move forward
based on what I want,

296
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,910
like "I want to sell"
or "I want to do this more."

297
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:26,912
It's because people
are expecting it from us,

298
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:29,414
that we are able to move forward.

299
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:31,283
I'm thankful for that.

300
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:38,023
-We are...
-KAT-TUN!

301
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:45,697
<i>They've returned.</i>

302
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:55,240
Good job.

303
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:57,209
I'm at my limit.

304
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:03,348
<i>KAT-TUN's new story has just begun.</i>

305
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:11,289
<i>They have now started moving ahead
to the next tour.</i>

306
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:19,598
<i>On the next</i> Ride On Time<i>,</i>

307
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,971
{\an8}<i>we'll look at how they continue
to face their daily lives</i>

308
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:27,739
{\an8}<i>for the sake of the new KAT-TUN.</i>

309
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:29,641
{\an8}Fifty times.

310
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:33,311
{\an8}If I hadn't started boxing, I probably
would have become a bad adult.

311
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:38,049
{\an8}<i>And they start production on
their first album in four years.</i>

312
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,486
{\an8}Properly making songs
for a group of three.

313
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:44,689
{\an8}I think it would be good to
have something surprising.

314
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:48,960
{\an8}The feeling of needing to go
to the next level.

315
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:49,961
{\an8}Action!

316
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:51,897
{\an8}-What are you doing here?
-Ueda?

317
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,198
{\an8}Huh?

318
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:58,837
<i>What do they want their future to hold?</i>

319
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:00,839
