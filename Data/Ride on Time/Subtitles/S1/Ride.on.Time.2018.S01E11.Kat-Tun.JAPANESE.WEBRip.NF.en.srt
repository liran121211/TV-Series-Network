00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,373
{\an8}<i>April 20th. Tokyo Dome.</i>

2
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:09,843
Let's set sail!

3
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:13,213
<i>After two years, they've come back.</i>

4
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:20,253
Today, we are completely finished
with the recharging period!

5
00:00:22,922 --> 00:00:25,258
{\an8}<i>The return of KAT-TUN.</i>

6
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:35,335
<i>Originally,
they started as a group of six,</i>

7
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:37,771
<i>but went through difficult times,</i>

8
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:39,172
<i>and are now three.</i>

9
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:44,544
<i>They stand onstage carrying</i>

10
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,746
<i>many feelings in their hearts.</i>

11
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:49,616
{\an8}YUICHI NAKAMARU (AGE 35)

12
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:51,818
{\an8}All three members are necessary,

13
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:54,754
{\an8}and I think the moment that changes,
we won't be KAT-TUN.

14
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,690
{\an8}After all the difficult things
we went through,

15
00:00:57,757 --> 00:01:01,494
{\an8}I want the three of us to
find happiness together.

16
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:05,231
{\an8}It's a way to show my resolve
to the members who left.

17
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:09,636
And I guess we also have our pride.
And the fans.

18
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:36,062
<i>This is documentary series</i> Ride On Time.

19
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:43,203
<i>The concerts for KAT-TUN's return
lasted for three days at Tokyo Dome.</i>

20
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:50,677
<i>The title represents
the unity of the three of them.</i>

21
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,179
<i>It's called UNION.</i>

22
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:55,849
{\an8}-Good morning.
-Good morning.

23
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:57,050
{\an8}APRIL 22ND BEFORE THE CONCERT

24
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:00,420
{\an8}<i>A meeting is held backstage.</i>

25
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:06,526
<i>While discussing what concept
they should use for the new album,</i>

26
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,863
<i>the topic changes to
the new direction KAT-TUN should take.</i>

27
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:19,205
I feel like we can finally put an end
to the kinds of messages

28
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,708
we used for these concerts.

29
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:23,643
Like the logo we are using.

30
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:28,448
In the past years,
we have been losing members,

31
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:31,551
so a lot of the themes have been linked

32
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:33,653
to how we felt at the time.

33
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:36,723
I want to leap ahead

34
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:38,658
and have a more creative start

35
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:40,627
to go to the next level.

36
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:43,396
Rather, if we don't
go to the next level,

37
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:45,965
it'll be a problem.
Especially after this concert.

38
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:48,968
Aren't these concerts like that?
We are always saying,

39
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:51,638
"Let's laugh and move on."
Since it's like that,

40
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:54,407
I think it'd be cool to
take a step forward.

41
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:59,279
So we will be properly
connected to the audience.

42
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,649
{\an8}<i>We follow their daily lives.</i>

43
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,989
{\an8}APRIL 5TH CHOFU, TOKYO

44
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,091
{\an8}Good morning.

45
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:16,262
{\an8}<i>On the same day as the rehearsal
for the concerts,</i>

46
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:19,132
{\an8}<i>Kamenashi goes to film a commercial.</i>

47
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,834
{\an8}FILMING OF COMMERCIAL
"HOKEN MINAOSHI HONPO"

48
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:23,870
<i>He will take on something</i>

49
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:26,806
<i>he has little experience with,
contemporary dance.</i>

50
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:33,413
Good morning.

51
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,481
Thirty seconds...

52
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:39,586
<i>The one in charge of the choreography
is world-famous dancer,</i>

53
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:41,387
<i>Tomohiko Tsujimoto.</i>

54
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:44,757
<i>He is the first Japanese male dancer</i>

55
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:47,727
<i>to have worked in Cirque du Soleil.</i>

56
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:50,997
After I learn this today,

57
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:54,734
I'm going to forget all the concert
choreography from up until yesterday.

58
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:58,638
Let's do our best.

59
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:02,842
<i>They only have an hour
and a half to practice.</i>

60
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:06,546
One, two, three,

61
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,281
four, foot.

62
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:09,182
Elbow.

63
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:11,918
Front. One, two,

64
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:12,986
three, po.

65
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,754
One, two, three, po.

66
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:16,556
This requires different muscles.

67
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,327
<i>These movements are completely different</i>

68
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:24,063
<i>from how he normally dances.</i>

69
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:28,735
Turn and left foot.

70
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:30,036
The left one.

71
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:32,105
-I can't.
-Your left leg.

72
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,375
How can you all stand still?

73
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:42,015
We'll get on our shoulder.

74
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:43,850
-On the shoulder?
-Yes.

75
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:46,052
Yes, like that.

76
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,956
Like that, turn your right leg

77
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,226
and put your left hand
on the floor and use it

78
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,895
to lift your body up.

79
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,064
Like this...

80
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,700
-<i>Each step is becoming harder and harder.</i>
-And po.

81
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,169
I'm lost.

82
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:12,111
<i>It's important for Kamenashi
to express himself using only his body.</i>

83
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,516
Now salsa. One, two,

84
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:18,418
Salsa. One, two, three.

85
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:34,500
<i>The real take. Will he be able
to meet their expectations?</i>

86
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:39,472
Ready... start.

87
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:49,382
Po!

88
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,461
Po!

89
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:05,264
Okay, cut!

90
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:07,900
When I saw my hand, it was too late.

91
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:10,303
Okay, let me try again.

92
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,605
If I could do it again...

93
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,107
Ready...

94
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:15,975
Start!

95
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:17,977
Po!

96
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,923
It's like my leg wouldn't lift up.

97
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:32,658
And then...

98
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:34,560
-Like this, right?
-Yes.

99
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:36,729
I can't lift it from here.

100
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:44,971
{\an8}1 HOUR AND 30 MINUTES
SINCE START OF THE TAKE

101
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:47,006
{\an8}I can't stand firm.

102
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:49,742
{\an8}-Your legs are tired?
-My legs are tired.

103
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:50,710
I can't hold it.

104
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:52,879
Now, I want to work harder

105
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:54,380
to increase the quality.

106
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:56,082
I want to stay perfectly still.

107
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,224
Po!

108
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,761
Wait! My leg...

109
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,196
It's not responding.

110
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:11,964
It's swollen.

111
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,370
<i>He joined the agency at the age of 12.
It's been 20 years.</i>

112
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,775
<i>He is going to meet
everyone's expectations.</i>

113
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:25,711
<i>That is the path he has chosen.</i>

114
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,083
Contemporary dance is amazing.

115
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:32,418
Let's go.

116
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:34,954
I'm a contemporary dancer.

117
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:44,263
Po!

118
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:53,039
Po!

119
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,842
Cut!

120
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:58,911
<i>He's danced for three hours.</i>

121
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:02,114
<i>He's met their expectations.</i>

122
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:06,986
KAT-TUN members are troublemakers.

123
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:08,020
No way.

124
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:09,121
Troublemakers.

125
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:10,857
Is that why we lost three members?

126
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:12,391
But I think it's good.

127
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:14,927
-That's true.
-It was your destiny.

128
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:18,564
I really think so.
Once you turn 30,

129
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:20,600
you realize everybody is different.

130
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:23,069
That's how it is.

131
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:26,439
It's amazing that you're doing

132
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,074
the Dome with three people.

133
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,041
It must be tough.

134
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:30,776
I'm thankful.

135
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:32,745
It's amazing.

136
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:35,147
The three of us can perform at the Dome

137
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:36,616
thanks to the fans.

138
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:37,683
Of course.

139
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:43,189
<i>That's why they have to do
something only the three of them can do.</i>

140
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:46,659
{\an8}TATSUYA UEDA (AGE 35)
APRIL 17TH FILMING OF <i>VS ARASHI</i>

141
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:48,327
{\an8}<i>On the other hand, Ueda</i>

142
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:52,231
{\an8}<i>appeared on a popular program
that makes you use your body.</i>

143
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,503
Start!

144
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:02,775
<i>Ueda is known for being an idol</i>

145
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,978
<i>with a lot of athletic ability.</i>

146
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:08,281
Ten seconds have passed!

147
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:14,654
<i>He is also able to run
400 meters in 50 seconds.</i>

148
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:17,890
<i>Even athlete Sou Takei,
was also surprised.</i>

149
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,860
{\an8}Your physical ability is pretty good.

150
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:23,329
{\an8}There aren't many ordinary people

151
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:25,064
{\an8}who can do that.

152
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:27,066
<i>It's because he hates losing,</i>

153
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:29,335
<i>that he developed these abilities.</i>

154
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:34,373
I don't know, but with Johnny's idols,

155
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:37,710
they are very popular from
the beginning, right?

156
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:41,314
While their own abilities
are still insufficient,

157
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,915
they have a huge fan base.

158
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:45,751
During the process of growing up,

159
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:48,955
they try to live up to
the expectations of those fans.

160
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:52,358
They acquire different abilities

161
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,727
and expand into different fields.

162
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:57,930
For Ueda, it's his physique.

163
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:02,702
He moves more than anybody else.

164
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:04,537
To find his very own weapon

165
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,906
he is working hard, training every day.

166
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:10,910
He also texts me sometimes
asking me to go running with him.

167
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:11,811
-Really?
-Yeah.

168
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:14,447
He is a very greedy man.

169
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,485
<i>There is something that Ueda
has been devoting himself to</i>

170
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:21,420
<i>ever since his debut.</i>

171
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,060
<i>That thing is boxing.</i>

172
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,799
<i>He once aimed to be a professional.</i>

173
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,769
<i>He didn't, due to everyone's objection,</i>

174
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:38,771
<i>but that's how obsessed he was.</i>

175
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:47,380
The sound of the sandbag
when you punch it, is something

176
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:48,714
that I really love.

177
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:52,084
It's like the accomplished feeling you get

178
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:55,187
after you give your all for something.

179
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:56,555
I think I like that.

180
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:58,157
It's similar to concerts.

181
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:00,493
I'm very sensitive to the voices

182
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,128
of the fans in the audience.

183
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:04,130
I can sense their mood for that day,

184
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:06,065
like if they're a calm crowd.

185
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:07,700
So, when we raise the curtain

186
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:08,901
and I hear them scream,

187
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,504
I'm happy and think, "Today feels good."

188
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:22,515
<i>He started boxing right after his debut.</i>

189
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,185
<i>With all the disputes they had,</i>

190
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:28,521
<i>Ueda was always fighting.</i>

191
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:34,427
<i>The outlet for his irritation was boxing.</i>

192
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:38,097
Okay.

193
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:40,900
This is very hard.

194
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,203
<i>Today's sparring partner is a boy</i>

195
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,539
<i>who is aiming to be a professional.</i>

196
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:57,116
<i>He devotes himself to it</i>

197
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,086
<i>to feel a sense of accomplishment.</i>

198
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:11,230
<i>That has become his support
to stand onstage</i>

199
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,032
<i>as an idol.</i>

200
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:19,872
That's enough!

201
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:21,307
Good job!

202
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:24,710
Yes, when I feel like that...

203
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:29,248
In the past,
when I was a member of Johnny's Jr.,

204
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:31,083
I was short-tempered,

205
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:32,785
and I was always fighting.

206
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:38,691
If I didn't have this, the stress
of work and everything else...

207
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,762
It's because I have boxing

208
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:46,065
that I can find that compromise.

209
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:51,337
I've been boxing for more than ten years.

210
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:55,007
Without this, I probably
would've become a bad adult.

211
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,244
Fifty is enough. Fifty times.

212
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,079
...eight, nine, ten...

213
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:04,083
One, two, three, four, five...

214
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:07,720
Thirty. One, two, three...

215
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:13,926
<i>On this day, Nakamaru goes to
a company in the metropolitan area.</i>

216
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:17,396
{\an8}How long has it been?

217
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,265
{\an8}About half a year.

218
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:20,232
{\an8}YUICHI NAKAMURA (AGE 35)

219
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:25,504
<i>Someone he wants to see is here.</i>

220
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,842
-Good morning.
-Morning.

221
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:32,211
-It's been a while.
-Nice to see you.

222
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:35,815
{\an8}<i>He is game designer Hideo Kojima.</i>

223
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:36,849
{\an8}HIDEO KOJIMA GAME DESIGNER

224
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,084
{\an8}<i>He's created games like
the Metal Gear series.</i>

225
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:43,823
{\an8}<i>Now, he is a man who is respected
by creators from all over the world.</i>

226
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:46,125
{\an8}THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION
OF PRODUCERS CHOSE HIM

227
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:48,327
{\an8}AS ONE OF THE MOST INNOVATIVE CREATORS
AND PRODUCERS IN THE WORLD (2006)

228
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:55,067
{\an8}<i>This is the trailer of his latest
project that hasn't been released yet.</i>

229
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:14,753
<i>They met eight years ago
and connected immediately.</i>

230
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,958
<i>Nakamaru is inspired by</i>

231
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:21,961
<i>Kojima's attitude towards creating things.</i>

232
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,536
-On the PlayStation engine...
-Wow.

233
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:33,772
<i>On that day, they were checking</i>

234
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:36,242
<i>the CGI effects used on humans.</i>

235
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,944
This is the motion capture.

236
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:42,882
We draw dots and...

237
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:45,150
<i>While using the latest technology</i>

238
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:47,786
<i>there are some things
they can only get</i>

239
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,290
<i>from real human beings
to get a sense of reality.</i>

240
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:53,225
{\an8}CG CHARACTER MODELED AFTER AN ACTOR

241
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:56,462
{\an8}<i>And that way of thinking</i>

242
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:58,931
{\an8}<i>has had a big influence on Nakamaru.</i>

243
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,102
<i>While he's here...</i>

244
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:04,770
How interesting...

245
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:06,639
Amazing.

246
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:10,776
It's amazing. I can feel the combination
of technology and human beings.

247
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:13,779
Thank you for this experience.

248
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:16,482
You can be a cameo.

249
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:18,150
Feel free to use it.

250
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:19,485
I can be an extra.

251
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,921
We don't have data
of your facial expressions...

252
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:27,526
<i>They decided to have dinner together.</i>

253
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:35,367
<i>Places like these are the best</i>

254
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:37,803
<i>to study Kojima's way of thinking.</i>

255
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:43,275
Kojima's attitude
towards creating things

256
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,345
and his way of thinking is something...

257
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,950
I'm always trying to imitate...

258
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:52,618
Always.

259
00:15:57,489 --> 00:15:59,625
-I thought I'd put it out there.
-Thank you.

260
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:01,193
When was it?

261
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:06,198
I think it was because I saw
the making of a video game.

262
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,435
That really influenced me a lot.

263
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:11,503
They finished it,

264
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:13,605
or so I thought.

265
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:17,710
But after that, you continued
to work on it for several weeks.

266
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:20,212
You said it was very
important for the quality.

267
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:23,315
-That's amazing.
-How much time was left?

268
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:24,316
Yes.

269
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:28,520
How that time could determine if it is
a bad or good game.

270
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:31,957
I don't mean to compare it literally,
but for concerts,

271
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:35,828
until the end of the production,
depending on how much

272
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:37,596
energy you put into it,

273
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:39,798
it could be a good or bad concert.

274
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:44,103
Kojima's words always
come to mind, and I think,

275
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:46,105
"Ah, I have to work hard."

276
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:51,543
To create something good,
don't you use your instinct?

277
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:53,779
Even if it worked before,

278
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,315
if you feel hesitant,
you should trust that feeling

279
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:58,083
even if it's just you.

280
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:02,087
Of course, you might be wrong,

281
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:05,224
but whether you think that or not,

282
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:07,860
will change everything.

283
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,531
Entertainment isn't a necessity, you know?

284
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:16,068
If you don't have great dedication,

285
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:17,336
it's impossible.

286
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:21,306
"Why is he so passionate?"
"Why is he saying that?"

287
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:24,743
Even if they don't understand
at that time, when you work together,

288
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:26,478
they will know it eventually.

289
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,680
That's how one creates things.

290
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:34,286
<i>What's important is to keep thinking
until the very end.</i>

291
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,493
Ready... start.

292
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:43,228
<i>June.</i>

293
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:45,097
TOKYO, JUNE

294
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:46,331
{\an8}FILMING OF THE MUSIC VIDEO FOR "KUN"

295
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:49,401
{\an8}<i>While making KAT-TUN's new album,</i>

296
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:51,570
{\an8}<i>the three of them were in a hurry</i>

297
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,706
{\an8}<i>to film the music video.</i>

298
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:04,616
<i>On top of that,
Nakamaru had a deadline coming soon.</i>

299
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:08,153
Okay. Cut.

300
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,121
-Okay.
-Cut.

301
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:11,757
Have you finished your lyrics?

302
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:13,192
No. As expected, I haven't.

303
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,560
As expected...

304
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:15,861
I have them with me.

305
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:17,629
They're due today.

306
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,498
-Is that so?
-Yes.

307
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:21,433
-Really?
-Yes.

308
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,068
I've only completed like 6,5%.

309
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:23,969
Oh, man.

310
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:27,306
<i>He still hasn't written the lyrics
for his solo song.</i>

311
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:28,307
Where do you work?

312
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:29,475
In the car.

313
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,744
Can we film it for a bit?

314
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:35,314
Yes, but it's not finished at all.

315
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,281
{\an8}LYRICS

316
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:38,217
{\an8}What is the theme?

317
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,318
{\an8}About love.

318
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:42,121
{\an8}A boy and a girl love each other

319
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:45,858
{\an8}but for some reason,
they can't get together.

320
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:47,559
I'm not progressing at all.

321
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:53,098
It's like, I wonder
if something is good...

322
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,168
I go forward two lines and then back two,

323
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:58,036
so I make no progress.

324
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:01,440
I thought it would be
better to write it myself.

325
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:08,147
I think the fans will
pay more attention to it

326
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,483
if I do it.

327
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:13,886
That's why I'm writing it.

328
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:16,255
-Good work.
-Thanks.

329
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:21,059
<i>What's important is to think

<i>He plays an earnest young man named Naoki,</i>

<i>For the album,</i>

00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:42,608
Hanshin will be in Koshien tomorrow.

348
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:44,776
What song is included?

349
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:45,911
"Unstoppable"

350
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:48,113
is an option.

-The PV filming is on the second, right?
-Yes.

00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:56,021
If we have to film it,
learn the dance, and record it,

353
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,723
why don't I have the song yet?

354
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:05,163
<i>He is doing various jobs at the same time</i>

355
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:08,900
<i>and he is in a position where
he has to meet expectations.</i>

356
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,773
<i>We tried to ask him about that.</i>

357
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:19,111
Kamenashi, a lot of genres―

358
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:20,345
Not right now.

359
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:21,480
Ah, sorry.

360
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,949
I need to focus on the lines.

361
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:26,585
<i>He is focused</i>

362
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:30,088
<i>on the work before him.</i>

363
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,392
{\an8}MAY 31ST

364
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,962
<i>It's the final day
of filming for Kamenashi.</i>

365
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:42,934
<i>It's the scene where he faces
his older brother, who is a murderer.</i>

366
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,704
<i>He's very focused.</i>

367
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:49,941
-Okay, we are starting.
-Okay.

368
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:52,377
Ready... action.

369
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:56,815
You can go.

370
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:12,497
Why did you do it?

371
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:16,268
I'm sorry.

372
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:21,540
Don't just say sorry!

373
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:22,841
Answer me!

374
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:24,910
Why did you do something so stupid?

375
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:25,811
Stop!

376
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:26,712
Stop!

377
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:44,296
<i>The filming has finished.</i>

378
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:48,533
The last lines were difficult.

379
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:59,010
<i>He is still immersed in his character.</i>

380
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:12,424
<i>Tomorrow, he will start recording.</i>

381
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:19,297
{\an8}<i>On the next</i> Ride On Time<i>,</i>

382
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:23,034
{\an8}<i>KAT-TUN will prepare for
their first national tour in four years.</i>

383
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:27,706
{\an8}We need to properly tackle something new.

384
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:32,210
{\an8}<i>How will the three of them
face the new stage?</i>

385
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:41,420
{\an8}<i>We'll also see the difficulty
they faced before the first concert.</i>

386
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:47,526
{\an8}It's hard. I don't know what we should do.

387
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,662
{\an8}<i>What happened?</i>

388
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:57,402
<i>We'll finish watching
their 300 hectic days.</i>

389
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,839
