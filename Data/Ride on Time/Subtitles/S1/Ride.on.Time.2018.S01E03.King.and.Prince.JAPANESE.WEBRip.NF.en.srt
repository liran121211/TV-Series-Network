<i>"This is a record of youths</i>

2
00:00:04,938 --> 00:00:08,141
<i>who devoted their adolescence
to entertainment."</i>

3
00:00:10,243 --> 00:00:15,281
<i>Since their debut in May, King & Prince
have been basking in the spotlight.</i>

4
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:20,920
<i>However, each of them has experienced</i>

5
00:00:20,987 --> 00:00:23,656
<i>various trials on their road to success.</i>

6
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:29,229
<i>The days when they were
desperate for work.</i>

7
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:33,933
{\an8}That was really shocking for me.
I was 18 at the time.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,769
{\an8}We hit rock bottom.

9
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:41,207
<i>The disappointment of
being overtaken by a younger generation.</i>

10
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:46,813
{\an8}He surpassed me and others.
I was speechless.

11
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:48,581
{\an8}I was a complete mess.

12
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:53,353
{\an8}<i>And even now, after their debut,</i>

13
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,089
{\an8}<i>there are members
who are facing inner struggles.</i>

14
00:00:56,923 --> 00:01:00,794
When I think about what would've happened
if I didn't join Johnny's

15
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,730
and gave up on
becoming a pro, it scares me.

16
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:08,134
Only people who've gone through it
would understand.

17
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:13,006
<i>Iwahashi was doing his best</i>

18
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,741
<i>to suppress his deepest emotions.</i>

19
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:40,667

20

21

<i>for their first concert tour.</i>

22
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:53,113
-I can do that.
-We can try keeping a distance.

23
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:54,247
Want to try it once?

24
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:59,486
<i>They rehearse
during the little time that they have.</i>

25
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:05,525
<i>But as they do, disagreements
begin to rise among the members.</i>

26
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:07,894
Listen.

27
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:10,797
You've got to listen.

28
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,569
<i>It was Iwahashi who lost his temper.</i>

29
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,238
Take it seriously.

30
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,644
If you can't take it seriously, just quit.

31
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,482
<i>What happened to Iwahashi and Jinguji?</i>

32
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:34,454
<i>With their first concert tour coming up,</i>

33
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:37,924
<i>can the six of them restore their bond?</i>

34
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:47,467
SHINKIBA, TOKYO

35
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,002
Ready.

36
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:53,106
<i>In late June, they were doing
a photoshoot for the merchandise</i>

37
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:55,575
<i>for their first concert tour.</i>

38
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:59,445
Okay.

39
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,316
-Now, let's do a serious look.
-Okay.

40
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:06,619
{\an8}It's hot today. I'm sweating.

41
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:11,257
{\an8}<i>He had just finished
filming a drama series.</i>

42
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:13,493
Are you getting rest?

43
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:19,899
Somewhat, I guess.

44
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:23,603
I don't have any free time, though.
I haven't been able to

45
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:27,707
go out to eat or anything like that.
I guess the schedule was...

46
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:32,645
pushed back. Everyone was pretty busy.

47
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,481
Next, we'll take photos
for the tour pamphlet.

48
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,717
<i>His busy schedule as an idol</i>

49
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:40,119
<i>has made him resilient.</i>

50
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:49,929
<i>Here is Genki Iwahashi, a man who is
strongly committed to being an idol.</i>

51
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:57,070
<i>He has a remarkably strong
sense of responsibility</i>

52
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:59,939
<i>as a member of King & Prince.</i>

53
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:07,780
<i>During the photoshoot, Iwahashi opened up</i>

54
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:10,083
<i>about his feelings toward the group.</i>

55
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:14,187
If the six of us...

56
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:18,791
appear on music shows
or perform at concerts,

57
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:24,731
and all of us are shining,

58
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:27,934
the audience will begin to lose interest.

59
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:32,605
When the six of us
are together, I think about

60
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:39,412
how everyone else will shine
and how I can help them shine.

61
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,449
<i>Iwahashi's resolve is so strong</i>

62
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:46,919
<i>at just 21 years of age.</i>

63
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,761
<i>Iwahashi joined the agency
in his 2nd year of junior high.</i>

64
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:58,464
<i>His sweet, androgynous appearance</i>

65
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:00,300
<i>instantly caught people's attention.</i>

66
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:06,339
{\an8}<i>By the time he was in the unit Prince
with Kishi and Jinguji,</i>

67
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:09,108
{\an8}<i>his popularity had brought him to
first place on the list of</i>

68
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:13,846
{\an8}<i>"Johnny's Jr. members you'd want
as a boyfriend" for five years straight.</i>

69
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,650
As a Johnny's Jr. member,

70
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:21,321
that was my biggest claim to fame,

71
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:23,956
but it's nothing more than
a past achievement.

72
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:26,025
But at the same time,

73
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:30,029
I am very honored that I was ranked

74
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:33,733
first place in those boyfriend rankings.

75
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:35,935
I couldn't be more honored.

76
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:39,305
And so, now that we're a group,

77
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:47,513
I want to make the five of them shine
and make our group even bigger,

78
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:52,752
so that we can provide all sorts of
entertainment to the people

79
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,587
who have been supporting us.

80
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:57,657
That is how I want to repay them.

81
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,397
You'll get a tan.

82
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,367
-I don't mind.
-You don't?

83
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:08,334
It's okay.

84
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:10,636
<i>Iwahashi's feelings toward the group</i>

85
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:14,974
<i>will end up manifesting
in an unexpected way.</i>

86
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:19,479
TOKYO

87
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:20,380
<i>July.</i>

88
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:24,117
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

89
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:28,020
<i>It is finally time
for the concert tour rehearsal.</i>

90
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:30,022
Good morning.

91
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:35,495
<i>On this day, something that the members
were waiting for was revealed.</i>

92
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:39,932
-Oh, wow!
-Amazing.

93
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:42,902
-It's so cool.
-The inside will have a damaged look.

94
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:46,406
<i>The stage costumes were
designed according to each member.</i>

95
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:49,275
These pants are really cute.

96
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:54,847
<i>Even the stage design is massive,
something unheard of for a new group.</i>

97
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:58,818
You're here. Can you see your color?

98
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:02,422
<i>More than ten thousand fans
will fill this arena.</i>

99
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:05,191
For "Ho! Summer"...

100
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:08,227
<i>All six of them must memorize</i>

101
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:10,730
<i>their own movements.</i>

102
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:12,732
During the chorus, you will move here.

103
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:18,438
<i>They only explain it once.
No one asks for him to repeat it.</i>

104
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:21,574
Hirano, you'll come down here briefly...

105
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:23,476
-and then return.
-Understood.

106
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:28,748
{\an8}It's like this each time. Even if you
don't know, you say "Understood"

107
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:30,316
{\an8}and memorize it as you go.

108
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:34,253
At Johnny's, things move along
at a very fast pace.

109
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:36,222
We've gotten used to that.

110
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,225
This is the result of that.

111
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:41,461
<i>Speed is everything.</i>

112
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:47,066
{\an8}<i>That goes for dancing as well.</i>

113
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:53,539
<i>Their brand-new song
that they just received</i>

114
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:55,308
<i>still had no dance routine.</i>

115
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:05,051
<i>However, in just a few days
they've come this far.</i>

116
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:25,404
Stay in the line!

117
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:28,307
The centrifugal force
is really strong for me.

118
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:29,675
From the last chorus.

119
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:33,045
In the worst-case scenario,
we memorize it the day of.

120
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:36,015
We get the routine that day
and go up on stage.

121
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:38,584
{\an8}They teach you the routine once,

122
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:42,321
{\an8}and you have to be able to dance it
by the next time they play the song.

123
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:47,426
We've been trained like that
since we were in Johnny's Jr.

124
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:51,531
We memorize like our lives depend on it,
and that's why it's possible.

125
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,800
If you can't memorize the routine quickly,

126
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:56,569
you can't survive here.

127
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:00,339
You have to respond instantly.

128
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:04,644
Good morning.

129
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,914
<i>However, a few days later,</i>

130
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,616
<i>a problem will arise during the rehearsal.</i>

131
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:15,021
It doesn't hurt!

132
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:19,125
<i>On this day, they had finished
rehearsing most of their songs,</i>

133
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,561
<i>and the atmosphere was relaxed.</i>

134
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:25,598
During the first chorus...

135
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:28,601
<i>Even when deciding
who will be singing what line...</i>

136
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,138
Exit the stage during the chorus.

137
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:35,141
Hey, let's focus, guys.
Okay, I'll assign the parts.

138
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:40,079
<i>Someone was concerned
about this atmosphere.</i>

139
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,384
<i>That someone was Iwahashi,</i>

140
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:49,255
<i>who was here despite having a sore throat
and feeling under the weather.</i>

141
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,261
<i>Just then, the three members of Prince,</i>

142
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:59,131
<i>Kishi, Jinguji, and Iwahashi,
were told to correct their routine.</i>

143
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:06,439
During the verse of "Summer Station"
when Prince turns around,

144
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:08,774
Kishi and Jinguji have the numbers wrong.

145
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:10,676
In "Summer Station"?

146
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:12,612
<i>Prince's three members were called.</i>

147
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:15,615
This is number one.

148
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:17,516
<i>They must correct it quickly.</i>

149
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,151
You were off to the side.

150
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:20,453
I made it!

151
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:24,423
<i>There's a somewhat laid-back atmosphere.</i>

152
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:27,460
Wait, what part are we doing?

153
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,229
The part where you wait
with your backs turned.

154
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,267
No, I'm zero.

155
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:38,004
Really? Oh, it goes like that?

156
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,339
<i>As Iwahashi shows him the moves,</i>

157
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:42,041
<i>he seems a bit irritated.</i>

158
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:44,577
Listen.

159
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,613
You've got to listen.

160
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:50,583
Cut it out.

161
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:55,655
During the introduction dance...

162
00:10:57,923 --> 00:10:59,291
<i>And in time...</i>

163
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:02,862
What's your problem?

164
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:13,472
<i>Something about Jinguji
was irritating Iwahashi.</i>

165
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,913
<i>The other members can only watch.</i>

166
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:27,086
<i>What was he angry about?</i>

167
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:30,656
You're off doing your own thing.

168
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:34,326
I'm telling you,
but you won't even listen.

169
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:38,431
That's why you still don't get it,
and you're laughing it off.

170
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:41,634
It's been happening a lot lately,
and I've been holding it in.

171
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:47,306
I lost my temper, and that wasn't right.

172
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:51,110
But if you're a member of this group,

173
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,478
you have to get it together.

174
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:59,652
<i>Jinguji was doing his best
to take in Iwahashi's words.</i>

175
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:07,259
{\an8}<i>They joined the agency
on exactly the same day</i>

176
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,529
{\an8}<i>and are called Jiguiwa by their fans.</i>

177
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:12,798
{\an8}<i>They are like brothers.</i>

178
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:18,604
{\an8}<i>In Johnny's Jr.,
they were both part of Prince.</i>

179
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:23,843
{\an8}<i>As Mr. King kept rising in popularity,</i>

180
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:27,947
{\an8}<i>both of them shared the same
frustration and trials</i>

181
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:29,749
{\an8}<i>as they pursued the same goal.</i>

182
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:36,422
<i>Iwahashi may have</i>

183
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:39,058
<i>chosen to speak up about</i>

184
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:42,728
<i>the laid-back atmosphere to Jinguji,
because he trusts him.</i>

185
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:48,734
<i>And the one who knows that the most</i>

186
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,503
<i>is Jinguji himself.</i>

187
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:56,142
Genki's the only person
who can say that kind of thing to me.

188
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,209
Oh, really?

189
00:12:57,676 --> 00:13:00,646
Have you seen him talk
that way to anyone else?

190
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:02,848
-I guess not.
-Right?

191
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:05,651
He can only speak up about it to me.

192
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:10,089
Genki is the type of person
who overthinks things.

193
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:11,290
Unlike me.

194
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:15,795
He has a lot of pent-up stress
from all those thoughts in his mind,

195
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:17,997
I think.

196
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,100
<i>Jinguji knows</i>

197
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:24,436
<i>about Iwahashi's suffering.</i>

198
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:29,875
<i>Iwahashi opened up about it</i>

199
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:33,579
<i>while strolling around Tokyo Dome,
a place where he has</i>

200
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,015
<i>always longed to perform.</i>

201
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:39,185
It's so hot.

202
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:45,524
<i>It started with the bitter experience
he went through in third grade.</i>

203
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:50,229
They'd ask,
"Why doesn't he come to school?"

204
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:53,599
or "Why does he get special treatment?"

205
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,234
and I would get bullied.

206
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,538
That kept me
from going to school even more,

207
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:01,507
so I stopped going altogether.

208
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:08,047
<i>Iwahashi was actually diagnosed
with a sickness</i>

209
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:10,216
<i>when he was a child.</i>

210
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,485
<i>As a result, he would miss school</i>

211
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:15,287
<i>and was even bullied.</i>

212
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:20,259
<i>Iwahashi finally felt like he belonged</i>

213
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,862
<i>when standing on the stage as an idol.</i>

214
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:28,500
<i>It was because he was able to
become a different version of himself.</i>

215
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:31,871
To tell you the truth,

216
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,174
I have always suffered from

217
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:37,943
something called panic disorder.

218
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:41,380
When I'm put in a situation

219
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:45,284
where I can't escape
or I don't know what to do,

220
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:47,519
I lose control of my emotions.

221
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,423
The only one
who knows about it is Jinguji.

222
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:56,762
I've been saved by him before.

223
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:01,467
I don't know when this will go away,

224
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:05,504
so I think of it as something
I will carry with me forever.

225
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,974
Finding how I can express myself

226
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:12,845
while living with this disorder

227
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:16,015
is a personal struggle of mine right now.

228
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:17,082
That's why,

229
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:21,053
I could never go up on stage

230
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:24,356
as the Genki Iwahashi that I am right now,

231
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,492
the way I am on my days off.

232
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:30,663
I can only show
the idol version of myself.

233
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,365
Or else, I'll have a panic attack.

234
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,835
But in a way, instead of hiding it,

235
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,004
talking about it like this

236
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,341
makes me feel better.

237
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:50,082
I want to perform here one day.

238
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:59,291
<i>Another member talks about his struggles</i>

239
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:00,526
<i>at a place memorable to him.</i>

240
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:07,433
<i>As the concert date approaches,
they continue to rehearse.</i>

241
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:09,368
Dance in front of me.

242
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,640
<i>Even after they run through it as a group,</i>

243
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,242
<i>one member stays to rehearse by himself.</i>

244
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:19,545
Spin.

245
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:21,246
<i>It's Ren Nagase.</i>

246
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:24,616
I'll be wearing a lot of fur.

247
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:26,285
It's really bulky.

248
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,554
Then just graze the fur.

249
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,055
On top of it, like this.

250
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:33,592
<i>Nagase is determined
to fulfill his duty as an idol,</i>

251
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:37,229
<i>since it is the job that he chose himself.</i>

252
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:42,801
<i>During the concert merchandise photoshoot,</i>

253
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:48,073
<i>he would check each photo.</i>

254
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:49,675
Thank you.

255
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:51,910
It affects the sales.

256
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:57,349
Are you making sure, as an idol,

257
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,451
that you look good in the photo?

258
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:02,654
Wouldn't you want to look good?

259
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:04,757
I get a sense

260
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:08,460
of what angle looks best
when I look at it.

261
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:09,795
That's what I check for.

262
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,230
I'm a professional.

263
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:14,433
Let's leave it at that.

264
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,137
<i>Nagase also had to overcome
his own struggles</i>

265
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,772
<i>in order to stand here today.</i>

266
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:27,579
<i>He grew up in a family
that had to move constantly.</i>

267
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,849
<i>Since childhood,
he would transfer schools often.</i>

268
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:34,119
<i>The pain that came from
parting with his friends</i>

269
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:37,156
<i>led him to put up emotional walls.</i>

270
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:43,328
<i>Johnny's was where Nagase</i>

271
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:46,165
<i>was able to build precious friendships.</i>

272
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:51,203
<i>However, during junior high,
he was contemplating</i>

273
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:54,606
<i>whether to stay an idol
or return to being a normal student.</i>

274
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:57,443
OSAKA

275
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,646
<i>At the time, he was living in Osaka.</i>

276
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,349
This is also where I joined Johnny's,

277
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:07,753
so I see this city as my birthplace

278
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,089
as a Johnny's member.

279
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:14,726
My personality
was shaped here in Osaka as well.

280
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,296
Of course, being able to
spend all three years

281
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:20,699
of junior high
in the same school until graduation

282
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:22,468
had a big effect on me.

283
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:27,439
<i>He wanted to meet the people
who supported him during those times.</i>

284
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,381
-Yes?
-There he is.

285
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:37,883
-Long time no see.
-There he is.

286
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,585
-There he is.
-How have you been?

287
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:41,453
-I'm great.
-So I hear.

288
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,288
-Thank you.
-Come in.

289
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:44,656
What a nice house.

290
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:48,594
<i>For all three years of junior high,
his teacher was Mr. Ukon.</i>

291
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:53,732
{\an8}<i>When Nagase was contemplating
about his future,</i>

292
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:55,834
{\an8}<i>he was always by his side.</i>

293
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:59,605
He was worrying about it
more than anyone else.

294
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:02,307
He wanted to choose the right high school.

295
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:03,775
He didn't want any regrets.

296
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:06,945
He thought about that
more than anyone else.

297
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,482
I looked up schools
that were understanding of his work,

298
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:13,051
but I remember him saying no.

299
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:16,688
You wanted to either study
or work in the entertainment industry.

300
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:18,857
Because my grades were pretty good.

301
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:20,225
That's right.

302
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:22,828
-You weren't sure.
-I thought it would be a waste.

303
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:26,198
Well, I ended up going
to a school that was

304
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:27,799
understanding of my work.

305
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:29,334
You did.

306
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:31,236
I thought that if I chose

307
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:34,239
while I was young,
I'd still have time to start over again.

308
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:36,275
I had that mentality already.

309
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:41,113
At the time,
I probably wanted to choose, early on,

310
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,081
whether to lead a normal life

311
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:46,585
or continue working
in the entertainment industry.

312
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:50,189
-Out of everyone, he had the hardest time.
-Oh, yeah?

313
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:53,959
-He would do his own research and such.
-I did!

314
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:57,596
He searched for places where
he could balance both work and school.

315
00:19:57,663 --> 00:20:01,433
You also felt like you were
causing your parents trouble.

316
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:04,836
So, you wanted to carefully decide

317
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:08,173
between working in entertainment
and focusing on studying.

318
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,241
That's right.

319
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:11,977
You've grown up so much.

320
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,780
But it's just begun.
I have to work hard from here.

321
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:22,254
<i>And there's one more thing
that supported Nagase.</i>

322
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:24,456
WE'RE OPEN, WELCOME!

323
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:26,692
<i>His best friends from Osaka.</i>

324
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:30,495
"Handsome men eat for free,"
so I always ate for free.

325
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:35,267
Long time no see!

326
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:38,103
-Welcome back.
-Long time no see.

327
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,072
Good to see you. Welcome back.

328
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:43,809
<i>This is Nishiyama, his classmate,
and his family-owned</i>

329
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,043
okonomiyaki <i>restaurant.</i>

330
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:50,449
<i>When he was in junior high school,
he ate here almost every day.</i>

331
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,252
I want <i>oden</i> too, later.

332
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:54,886
Have you found someone?

333
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:56,822
-No.
-Come on!

334
00:20:57,723 --> 00:20:59,491
-Find someone!
-I'm glad I didn't.

335
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:01,393
I would've had to say their name.

336
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:03,395
I would've asked for a photo.

337
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:04,997
Or else I wouldn't go home.

338
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:08,066
College is like that, isn't it?

339
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:10,836
I know, it's like that for me too.

340
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:14,539
<i>Spending time with friends
just like those days.</i>

341
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:16,808
<i>What a luxurious time.</i>

342
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:24,116
Delicious.

343
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,052
They would come after school

344
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:30,289
and eat here
before going home all the time.

345
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:33,959
Tell me if you want anything.

346
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,428
I remember your birthday.

347
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:38,597
-What?
-It's early in the year, right?

348
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:40,599
-You're February, right?
-Yeah.

349
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:42,868
-That's all I know.
-The 15th.

350
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:45,270
Right, it's near Valentine's.
What about me?

351
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:47,005
-January 23rd.
-Wow.

352
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,441
You remembered it was near Valentine's.

353
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:56,348
What a random conversation.

354
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:58,784
It's a rare sight.

355
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:00,986
-Hey!
-Where's Kazuya?

356
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:03,055
<i>More friends have come over.</i>

357
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:06,758
-You're late! Where's Kazuya?
-Sorry. Kazuya's over there.

358
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:09,061
Kazuya, run! Hurry up.

359
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:12,931
Long time no see.

360
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:15,467
How nostalgic.

361
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:16,702
ODEN
50 YEN

362
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,172
-You should come to Tokyo.
-He does go.

363
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:22,507
I went the day before yesterday.

364
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:25,544
-Yeah, he did go.
-Seriously?

365
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:29,014
-By train, it's 15 hours one way.
-What do you mean?

366
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:31,750
-It's torture.
-You took the regular train?

367
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:34,319
-Not the bullet train?
-I'm poor.

368
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:35,387
That's why?

369
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:37,456
But still...

370
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:40,992
He buys the Seishun 18 ticket.

371
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,463
-You're not 18.
-Yeah, but you can still buy it.

372
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,031
You can?

373
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:49,434
-Our youth is over.
-It never came.

374
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:56,241
<i>They're still 19.
He engraved into his heart</i>

375
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:59,411
<i>the emotions that are
easily forgotten in the limelight.</i>

376
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:03,849
All three of you should come to Tokyo.

377
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:09,287
-I want to go.
-You don't have school right now, right?

378
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:11,189
-Just for a day.
-It's torture.

379
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:12,924
-Let's go!
-Eight hours one way.

380
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:15,927
I'll be all alone!

381
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:18,997
{\an8}<i>On the next</i> Ride On Time<i>...</i>

382
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:22,434
{\an8}<i>Their concert tour has finally begun.</i>

383
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,203
{\an8}-What is this?
-This will hurt.

384
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:31,276
{\an8}<i>They are completely worn out,
but they keep performing.</i>

385
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:35,213
{\an8}When my eyes turn like this,
it's very bad.

386
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,681
{\an8}Excuse me.

387
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:39,551
{\an8}<i>A brief moment with his mentor.</i>

388
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:42,287
{\an8}That's what an idol is to me.

389
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:45,123
{\an8}Thank you for your work.

390
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,425
{\an8}Here we go!

391
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:49,594
{\an8}<i>It's time for their last stop on the tour.</i>

392
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:51,062
{\an8}Bye.

393
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:58,170
<i>What is it that awaits them?</i>

394
00:23:58,236 --> 00:23:59,805
-Thank you!
-Thank you!
