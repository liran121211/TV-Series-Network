<i>This has also been arranged

101

107
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:11,330
Yes.

I am very excited to see what kind of

116
00:07:56,175 --> 00:08:01,147
That's why I want people to witness this.

{\an8}It's so spacious, I was overwhelmed.
It's made me want to work harder.

Since we've been given this opportunity,
we must seize it.

120

This is a chance for us to mature,

{\an8}I am constantly surprised.

142
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:32,738
{\an8}We've never been on a talk show before.

143
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,412
Ohkura taught us three lessons of sorts.

144
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:41,614
First, have fun.

145
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:46,419
This is a chance for Naniwa Danshi
to perform a song,

146
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:48,487
so we have to have fun.

147
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,790
Second,

148
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:55,127
don't forget the view.

149
00:09:55,795 --> 00:10:00,232
We must not forget how the audience

150
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:04,570
reacts to us when we perform
in this Kyocera Dome.

151
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:11,143
And lastly,
come back here with our own strength.

152
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:16,449
We can't always be relying on others.

153
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:20,419
I want to show everyone
that there are still

154
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,323
fresh faces in Kansai.

155
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:27,994
That's my goal.

Unless you sit here, you don't know
what the audience is seeing.

161
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:58,057
If you just look forward while dancing,
the people on the third floor

162
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,725
can only see your head.

163
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:02,528
Just by lifting your head,
they can see your face.

164
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:07,400
Things like this, I learned from Kanjani∞.

165
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:11,370
When we're in these domes,
instead of just waving at the top floors,

166
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:15,675
we should look at each of their faces,
or else our feelings won't reach them.

167
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:16,876
They taught me that.

170
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:32,692
{\an8}<i>and thought about
quitting his idol career.</i>

171
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:39,932
The first, second,
and third years of college, I thought

172
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,501
about getting a job.

173
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:46,305
I even attended the job fairs,

174
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:49,041
but then the people

175
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:51,711
from the companies asked me
what I wanted to do.

176
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,113
I said I wanted to talk.

177
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,848
They said, "How about sales?"

178
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:58,617
but that wasn't really
what I wanted to do.

179
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,219
You know,

180
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:05,224
I feel the most alive when
I'm talking in front of a large audience.

181
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:07,626
So...

182
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:11,363
in the end, this is the job for me.

183
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:14,333
It is my vocation,

184
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:17,403
but it's scary.

185
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:20,873
It's so scary.

186
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,443
Because, my whole life is at stake.

187
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:27,780
It's the gamble of all gambles.

188
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,350
When the members who were in college
would go out to eat,

189
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,952
that's all we would talk about.

190
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:40,893
<i>From now on,
every day will be a challenge.</i>

191
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,166
<i>The concert is about to begin.</i>

192
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:51,804
Good morning.

193
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:53,472
Good morning.

194
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,042
Here's a gift.

195
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,780
<i>The other Kansai Johnny's Jr. members</i>

196
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:03,449
<i>and little children
have come for moral support.</i>

197
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:06,852
-Oh, wow.
-Amazing.

198
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:10,055
Wow.

199
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:11,557
It's pink.

200
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:13,826
<i>It's finally showtime.</i>

201
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:15,861
We're ready.

202
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:20,633
<i>Without hesitation...</i>

203
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:23,369
<i>Just being themselves...</i>

204
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:28,741
We'll be in your care.

205
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:30,376
Here we go.

206
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:35,681
<i>They are urged by their seniors
to move backstage.</i>

207
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:42,454
-Please have fun.
-Yes!

208
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:45,524
Treasure each moment.

209
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:47,526
Thank you!

210
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:54,266
Here we go!

211
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,571
<i>Their seniors have taken the stage.</i>

212
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:01,574
Amazing.

213
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:03,442
The voices are so loud.

214
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,443
How cool.

215
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:30,002
I'm nervous. I can't stay still.

216
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:35,474
It's our seniors' stage,

217
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:38,210
so we can't mess up.

218
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,145
I'm scared right now.

219
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,218
<i>It's almost their turn.</i>

220
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,993
It's Kanjani∞ after all,

221
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,228
so the crowd is revved up.

222
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:58,330
And we're going to jump in there.

223
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:00,633
Let's not stop this wave,

224
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,935
let's ride this wave.

225
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:04,837
Let's promote Naniwa!

226
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,705
Let's become popular!

227
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:08,674
-Let's go!
-Yeah!

228
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:15,281
And now, for the first time in four years,
a new unit has been born in Kansai.

229
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:17,583
Please give them a warm welcome.

230
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,852
Let's go, Naniwa Danshi.

231
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,409
The seven of us are Naniwa Danshi.

232
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:51,777
To all of you Eighters...

233
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:56,615
thank you for your precious time!

234
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:00,886
We did it!

235
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:02,488
We were fresh.

236
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:04,123
It was so fun.

237
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:08,027
{\an8}There was so much more to see than usual.

238
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:09,094
{\an8}The cheering too...

239
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:13,565
{\an8}The moment they said Naniwa Danshi,
the crowd cheered for us,

240
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:16,602
so it was easy to do and fun.

241
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:18,504
I was so nervous.

242
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:25,444
<i>What was the stage of their dreams like?</i>

243
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,813
{\an8}I was so nervous.

244
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,781
{\an8}DAIGO NISHIHATA (AGE 22)

245
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:32,317
{\an8}We only sang and danced to one song,

246
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,253
but I was so nervous,

247
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:39,425
my heart was beating so fast that
I think it'll be sore tomorrow.

248
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:45,030
{\an8}I never imagined the crowd would
cheer for us like that.

249
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:47,099
{\an8}I couldn't hide my surprise.

250
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:50,536
Before I knew it, I was laughing out loud.

251
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:54,239
{\an8}I purposely had my in-ear monitors off.

252
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:55,607
{\an8}I had it off my ear.

253
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:57,476
{\an8}When they said, "Naniwa Danshi"

254
00:17:57,543 --> 00:18:00,245
{\an8}and the crowd screamed,
I felt reassured and put it on

255
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:01,680
and sang, "Hey guys!"

256
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:06,718
I got a little teary-eyed at that moment,

257
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:10,355
and I felt more determined to work harder.

258
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,997
<i>Next time, they will come back here
with their own strength.</i>

259
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:24,837
<i>That is what they promised their seniors,
who gave them the best gift.</i>

260
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,742
<i>Late-November.</i>

261
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,916
<i>Since witnessing the excitement
of a dome concert,</i>

262
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:41,320
<i>the Kansai Johnny's Jr. members have been
exerting themselves even more</i>

263
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:44,823
<i>in their rehearsals for
the end-of-year performances.</i>

264
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:54,900
<i>Among them, a group of five junior high
boys aiming to be the next unit</i>

265
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,735
<i>have especially become self-aware.</i>

266
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:59,872
<i>For now, their goal is to become
like Naniwa Danshi.</i>

267
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,343
{\an8}Those members are such

268
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:07,913
{\an8}a big influence. They're our rivals.

269
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,047
I want to catch up.

270
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:17,222
{\an8}They're much older than us,
but they're shining.

271
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:20,125
They're the classic idol types.

272
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,030
{\an8}<i>Today, they're participating in this.</i>

273
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:28,567
{\an8}<i>It's their first time filming
a TV show together.</i>

274
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:34,139
<i>It's a special end-of-year show
where comedians and athletes</i>

275
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:36,275
<i>run in a long-distance</i> ekiden <i>relay race.</i>

276
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,312
They are from Kansai Johnny's Jr.

277
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:42,581
It's a pleasure to be here.

278
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:46,785
{\an8}What's your goal for
your first Kansai Ekiden?

279
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:50,989
{\an8}Since we're representing Johnny's,
we're here to win.

280
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:52,958
We'll try to leave claw marks.

281
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,193
Claw marks, you say?

282
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:59,565
<i>Whether it's breaking a record
or making a funny comment,</i>

283
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:03,702
<i>they want to produce some kind of result,
so that they are invited back again.</i>

284
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:08,540
If we use our youth
to beat those old guys,

285
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:11,076
it will make for
an interesting show, right?

286
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:14,179
-We'll overthrow them.
-That's right.

287
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,015
{\an8}We'll start in one minute!

288
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:19,885
{\an8}<i>The first runner is Takuya Nishimura.</i>

289
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:24,590
<i>Will these five
be able to produce results?</i>

290
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:26,825
-Ready...
-All right!

291
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,327
-Let's go.
-Set...

292
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:29,228
All right.

293
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,831
<i>He is off to a good start.</i>

294
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:38,670
<i>However, his opponents are adults,</i>

295
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:40,205
<i>and some are even athletes.</i>

296
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:42,407
<i>He is trailing behind.</i>

297
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,411
{\an8}-Seriously?
-This is bad.

298
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:47,479
{\an8}So, um...

299
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:53,452
{\an8}<i>Nishimura is the seventh
out of eight teams to pass the cord.</i>

300
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:55,988
{\an8}1ST LEG, TAKUYA NISHIMURA
2ND LEG, KOTARO OKAZAKI

301
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,064
Kotaro!

302
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:07,132
You can do it!

303
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:09,334
Do your best, Kotaro!

304
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:12,404
{\an8}<i>Although they're being cheered on,</i>

305
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:14,773
{\an8}<i>the other members can't
close the distance.</i>

306
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,041
{\an8}3RD LEG, FUGA ONISHI

307
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:18,243
{\an8}I'm exhausted.

308
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,078
{\an8}4TH LEG, TOA SHIMASAKI
LAST LEG, RUKU TOMA

309
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:24,249
{\an8}<i>By the time the last runner starts,
they are one lap behind.</i>

310
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:26,985
{\an8}7TH of 8 TO THE GOAL

311
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:28,654
{\an8}<i>They were utterly defeated.</i>

312
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,492
It was harder than I thought.

313
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:35,761
How frustrating.

314
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:40,966
So frustrating.

315
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:43,335
Happy New Year, everyone!

316
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:49,841
<i>In the end, they couldn't even
make a memorable comment.</i>

317
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:55,314
Did you leave claw marks?

318
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:58,583
-Not at all.
-I have regrets.

319
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,519
-Not even a scratch.
-We didn't.

320
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:02,421
They left a scar on us.

321
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:08,360
The person from Shochiku Geino
was so amazing.

322
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:11,430
The way he helped facilitate
the conversation was amazing.

323
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:15,167
Everyone got a chance in the spotlight.

324
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:17,002
I learned a lot from him.

325
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:19,037
You all did well!

326
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:20,739
{\an8}You Johnny's members did well.

327
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:22,040
{\an8}Thank you.

328
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:23,809
{\an8}Everyone started like this.

329
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,578
-See you next year.
-Next year.

330
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:31,083
<i>These five junior high boys
are always giving it their all.</i>

331
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:33,518
<i>After this,</i>

332
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:37,389
<i>they were given
an official unit name, "Lil Kansai".</i>

333
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:41,793
{\an8}JOICHIRO FUJIWARA (AGE 23)

334
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:46,398
{\an8}The younger ones, like Toa and Ruku

335
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:50,702
{\an8}and Nishimura... The five of them
are really charging forward with force,

336
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:54,106
so we have to work hard
to not fall behind.

337
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:00,479
<i>And on November 30th...</i>

338
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:08,186
<i>The special end-of-year performance
that will serve as a new stepping stone</i>

339
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:11,123
<i>for the Kansai Johnny's Jr. members
is about to begin.</i>

340
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,364
{\an8}<i>On the next</i> Ride On Time<i>...</i>

341
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:31,910
{\an8}<i>The Kansai Johnny's Jr. members
are finally getting ready</i>

342
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:34,012
