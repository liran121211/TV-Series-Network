<i>But inside the venue, they were still...</i>

00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:25,592
Okay, let's start the dress rehearsal.

7
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:27,394
Let's work hard.

8
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,030

<i>It's the first day,</i>

12
00:00:43,676 --> 00:00:46,012

<i>They are the staff behind the scenes.</i>

-He's so nervous he's about to throw up.
-Really?

18
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,695
-You're nervous?
-Yes.

19

20
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:07,200
Do your best.

<i>But an unexpected mechanical problem</i>

71
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:45,618
<i>prevented the equipment from going up.</i>

72
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:49,922
We didn't panic,
we just didn't know what to do.

73
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:52,625
I was worried
and nervous the whole time.

74
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:56,362
I'm sure no one expected
that kind of trouble.

75
00:04:56,929 --> 00:05:00,333
I was worried, thinking that
we may not be able to use it.

76
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,971
<i>She once dreamed of a career
in the music industry,</i>

77
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:06,539
<i>but she gave up.</i>

78

<i>Her new dream was to excite

79
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:23,623
{\an8}<i>Will they be able to rain</i>

80
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,926
{\an8}<i>gold confetti from the scrollers?</i>

81
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:35,435
<i>Then it happened...</i>

82
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:55,088
<i>The confetti and feathers
that rained from the ceiling</i>

83
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:57,390
<i>created a sensual performance.</i>

84
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:04,464
I've always wanted to
take part in a concert,

85
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:09,268
and I'm finally able to join
the arena tour.

86
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:13,473
I don't want to forget that feeling

87
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:17,210
I had when I was
in the audience at a concert.

88
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:21,581
I want to do more so that more people

89
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:24,984

90
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:27,387

{\an8}<i>the staff's determination
more than anyone else.</i>

94
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:42,535
Having the special effects
makes a very big difference.

95
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,771
It gets us excited,

96
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:47,540
and that relays to the audience.

97
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:52,512
It makes me realize that this stage
is created with teamwork.

98
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,013
Without the special effects,

99
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,282
I'm just rolling around

100
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,252
on the couch during my solo performance.

101
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:03,689
Of course, I put my all into it,

102
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,925
but that creates the atmosphere.

103
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,497
<i>On stage, they are about to begin</i>

Yeah.

{\an8}<i>Standing by under the stage was Ueda,

109
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:31,451
{\an8}<i>He joined this tour with only
three months of experience.</i>

110
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:40,760
<i>Gripped in his hand
was the concert progress chart.</i>

111
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:43,830
-Hey.
-Yes.

112
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:45,865
-Come here!
-Yes!

113
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,535
<i>He has been anxious</i>

114
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:51,504
<i>since the first day of preparation.</i>

115
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:54,607
It's very fast-paced,

116
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:57,810
so I have a hard time catching up
and understanding.

117
00:07:58,244 --> 00:07:59,779
I'm so anxious.

118
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:05,151
<i>But he always showed consideration
towards the members,</i>

119
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:07,620
<i>and paid attention to the small details.</i>

120
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:12,058
We were planning to place a basket here

121
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:14,894
where the performers
can return their glow sticks.

122
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:18,364
We're deciding on the height
of the basket.

123
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:25,304
<i>It's time for the quick change.</i>

124
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:31,310
<i>Ueda prepares the ring for
the members' quick change.</i>

125
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:34,814
<i>Since each team must work together,</i>

126
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:36,682
<i>he is feeling nervous.</i>

127
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,219
So, you're going to change?

128
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:44,390
<i>The ring made it safely to the stage.</i>

129
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,427
Let's change.

130
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:50,963
Start changing!

131
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,569
This is the quick-changing time!

132
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:59,438
I'm going to take a little peek.

133
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,409
He was wearing this the whole time?

134
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,480
<i>But this is where
the real challenge begins.</i>

135
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:10,216
<i>They must gather the props</i>

136
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:12,485
<i>that are thrown down to them.</i>

137
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:18,624
<i>Even if the props hit them on the head,</i>

138
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:20,426
<i>they don't have time to stop.</i>

139
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:27,433
<i>Because they must start preparing</i>

140
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,335
<i>for Chinen's solo performance.</i>

141
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:35,274
<i>There's something
he has been taught repeatedly.</i>

142
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:41,614
Personally, what I try to keep in mind
as a person behind the scenes,

143
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:44,784
is that we're not supposed to stand out.

144
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:48,020
We're not supposed to be seen.

145
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:52,792
If people see us,
or we if show up on the screen,

146
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,695
it lowers the quality of the concert.

147
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,197
So I'm very careful about that.

148
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:03,302
{\an8}Ueda has been with us ever since our...

149
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:04,203
{\an8}YURI CHINEN

150
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,671
{\an8}...dance rehearsal.

151
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:09,475
He does so much for us,
from organizing the props we use

152
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:12,044
to taking care of all the small details.

153
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:15,014
It's really dark behind the stage.

154
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:18,284
It's darker than you expect,
so when we leave

155
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:21,120
the bright stage
and step into the dark area,

156
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:22,588
we can't see a thing.

157
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:25,257
So, when he lights the way for us

158
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:28,160
and directs us to our next location,

159
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:29,328
it's a big help.

160
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:33,466
When the concert begins,
I'm not aware of my surroundings,

161
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,570
so when he's there to help me,

162
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,840
I can rely on him,

163
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:44,310
and that allows me
to concentrate on what I have to do.

164
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:47,446
I've been performing

165
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,916
in concerts ever since I entered Johnny's,

166
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:55,955
so sometimes I take this life for granted.

167
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:58,524
But if I was starting from scratch,

168
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:00,826
performing on the streets
instead of a concert,

169
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:05,431
I'd probably be just another boy.

170
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:09,635
So, by working with
these professionals, it's actually

171
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,039
shaping me to become professional as well.

172
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:16,809
The fans probably think
that's who I really am.

173
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:21,447
I don't think they would like me,
if they saw who I really was.

174
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,251
We're made to look glamorous, thanks to

175
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,421
the lighting, stage production,
and costumes.

176
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:31,390
I really believe
that we are able to continue

177
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:34,827
as idols because of
those people behind the scenes.

178
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:36,862
{\an8}SOUND
TAKUMA KURAMOCHI (AGE 22)

179
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:38,097
{\an8}<i>Like Ueda,</i>

180
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:42,301
{\an8}<i>Kuramochi works below stage
with the sound team.</i>

181
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:45,838
<i>He has overcome</i>

182
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:49,709
<i>many obstacles to get here today.</i>

183
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:55,147
<i>Nakajima has a tap dance routine
for his solo performance.</i>

184
00:11:56,949 --> 00:12:00,086
<i>In order for that sound to reach
every corner of the arena,</i>

185
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:02,555
<i>he attached
a small microphone to his shoes.</i>

186
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:06,225
<i>But the day before...</i>

187
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:12,965
I'm not sure, but he may have
stepped on the cable.

188
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:16,068
There was a problem,
and the cable disconnected.

189
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:22,441
{\an8}<i>The cable disconnected
during the rehearsal.</i>

190
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:30,249
<i>Through trial and error,
he was able to make improvements.</i>

191
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:40,426
<i>Will the sound of his shoes
be heard throughout the arena?</i>

192
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:42,962
{\an8}SPECIAL EFFECTS
MICHIRU YABE (AGE 21)

193
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:46,065
{\an8}<i>Yabe from special effects
was also behind the stage.</i>

194
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:54,140
<i>She is fanning smoke in preparation
for Nakajima's entrance.</i>

195
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:01,580
<i>It has begun...</i>

196
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,276
<i>The tapping of his shoes</i>

197
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:33,179
<i>could be heard throughout
the entire arena.</i>

198
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,123
Perfect.

199
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,297
<i>Nakajima says that
without Kuramochi's idea,</i>

200
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:55,000
<i>his performance
could not have been executed.</i>

201
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:59,939
{\an8}When I performed this tap dance
routine in the past,

202
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:03,876
{\an8}the cords were attached
to the inside of my pants,

203
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,178
and the mics were attached here.

204
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:07,746
Here on the arch of the foot.

205
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,815
But this time,

206
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,351
I had to move over here,

207
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:14,186
right after my solo,

208
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:17,356
to the center stage
and get on the lifter to perform

209
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:20,259
a song called "To the Galaxy."

210
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:22,328
And I had to change in between that.

211
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:24,563
So, this time he attached

212
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:28,500
a thin cord on the outside
of my pants using Velcro.

213
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:32,838
If the cord is too loose,

214
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:35,808
it can get stuck

215
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,777
or catch on something when I spin around.

216
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:41,847
So he secured the cord with several
pieces of Velcro down the pant leg,

217
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,717
so that it wouldn't stand out.

218
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:46,886
That was a great idea.

219
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:50,489
A performance like this
doesn't simply happen just because

220
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,959
I want to perform a tap dance routine.

221
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:57,529
There are a lot of things to consider
in order to make it happen.

222
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:01,867
I have so much respect for the staff
who make everything possible for us.

223
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,336
We work together

224
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:07,940
to overcome obstacles.

225
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:10,776
They always have a backup plan for us.

226
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:16,282
We get to see the excitement
behind creating and building a stage.

227
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:18,651
So it's very reassuring

228
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:20,619
to be on the same team as them.

229
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:25,291
<i>Now the concert is about to</i>

230
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:28,594
<i>display its main attraction,
the mobile stage.</i>

231
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:32,898
<i>A young man was working</i>

232
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:35,467
<i>to create that important moment.</i>

233
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:42,775
{\an8}<i>The concert is nearing its end.</i>

234
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:46,111
{\an8}<i>All the members dance on the mobile stage.</i>

235
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,714
{\an8}<i>This is the main attraction.</i>

236
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:58,223
{\an8}<i>First, the center stage tilts to
one side as they perform</i>

237
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:59,725
{\an8}<i>"To the Galaxy."</i>

238
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:15,674
<i>Waiting for his cue
in the shadows under the stage,</i>

239
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,010
<i>was the rookie special mechanic,</i>

240
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:19,478
{\an8}<i>Shoichiro Fukuda.</i>

241
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:22,982
{\an8}<i>He helped construct this stage.</i>

242
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:25,384
{\an8}SPECIAL MECHANICS
SHOICHIRO FUKUDA (AGE 24)

243
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,755
<i>Since all the members
will dance on top of it,</i>

244
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,057
<i>they had to make sure it was safe.</i>

245
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:35,894
<i>What troubled the staff was its weight.</i>

246
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:38,364
<i>Some parts weighed over one ton.</i>

247
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:41,333
Insert the bolt with the ratchet.

248
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,267
Okay.

249
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:45,270
We'll start with Fukuda's side.

250
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,040
Don't smash your finger.

251
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,343
It's your finger, not mine.

252
00:16:57,983 --> 00:16:59,918
{\an8}<i>During "Dance The Night Away",</i>

253
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:02,421
{\an8}<i>the main stage moves around.</i>

254
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:11,563
<i>Fukuda was placed in charge
of a lifting apparatus called the lifter.</i>

255
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:13,999
<i>Not only does it carry the members,</i>

256
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:16,702
<i>it also lifts props onto the stage.</i>

257
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:26,445
<i>With perfect timing, these stairs
were lifted onto the stage.</i>

258
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:34,053
When I see the equipment
that we set up actually move,

259
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:35,954
and I hear the crowd cheering,

260
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:40,292
it makes everything worthwhile
and it motivates me to continue this work.

261
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,762
{\an8}I trust the staff members.

262
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:48,667
{\an8}During the initial meeting,
we made some impossible requests.

263
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,970
But what's important is...

264
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:56,809
how close they can
turn that image into a reality.

265
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,645
This time...

266
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:04,583
That center stage
goes up and tilts to one side.

267
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,553
And it spins while it's tilted.

268
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,555
It's easy to

269
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:14,193
come up with those ideas,
but it's difficult to carry them out.

270
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:16,428
But they think about

271
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:20,299
how they can materialize our ideas.

272
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:21,567
The fans...

273
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:25,003
are here to see us,

274
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:29,374
so they may not give much thought
to those behind the scenes.

275
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:33,445
But we're creating this together
with the professional staff members.

276
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:36,014
They bring all of our ideas to fruition.

277
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,549
They're working with us

278
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:41,820
to turn our dream into a reality.

279
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:48,727
<i>They continued to tour
around the entire country.</i>

280
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:53,432

<i>The final day of the tour
was held in Nagano.</i>

282
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:02,674
<i>As the concert was nearing its end,</i>

283
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:08,113
{\an8}<i>Yabe from the special effects team
was in the back making preparations.</i>

285
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:14,620
<i>Yabe was once in the audience</i>

286
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:17,556
<i>feeling moved by
the impressive special effects.</i>

287
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,559
<i>Now she's on the side of
providing that experience.</i>

288
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,796
We are...

289
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:25,898
Come on!

290
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:29,701
Hey! Say! JUMP.

291
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,841
Thank you.

292
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:38,043
-Good job, good job.
-Thank you.

293
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,045
Thank you, everyone.

294
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:42,281
-Thank you.
-Bye.

295
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:45,083
-Good job.
-Thank you.

296
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,987
<i>Two months passed since the tour started.</i>

297
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:51,523
<i>With training under her belt,</i>

298
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,660
<i>Yabe silently completes her task.</i>

299
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,839
{\an8}<i>During the double encore,
when they were performing</i>

300
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:10,642
{\an8}<i>their hit song "Come On A My House,"</i>

301
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:23,922
<i>the concert staff members</i>

302
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:26,391
<i>came onto the stage.</i>

303
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:33,131
<i>They were all standing there
with big smiles on their faces.</i>

304
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:38,870
They got up on the stage with us.

305
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:41,306
During the song "Come On A My House,"

306
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,475
all the staff went up

307
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,379
onto the stage
and started dancing with curry.

308
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:48,947
All of us were like,

309
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:51,149
"What? You're supposed to be working."

310
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:55,587
But the Hey! Say! JUMP concerts
allow people to do things like that,

311
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:58,991
and the fans really appreciate

312
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:00,459
that warm atmosphere too.

313
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:02,794
So, we're like family.

314
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:07,699
I consider them
part of the Hey! Say! JUMP family.

315
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,837
Thank you.

316
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:15,407
-They left.
-That was awesome.

<i>The concert has ended.
Ueda was just seen on stage,</i>

319
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,519
<i>but now he's back to lighting

320
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:31,156
It's the end. Good work!

321
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,058
Good work.

{\an8}<i>Resisting the cruelty of fate,</i>

350
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:26,972
{\an8}<i>they have come back.</i>

<i>KAT-TUN.</i>

352
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:35,647
I knew that we would
get together again someday.

353
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:38,383
We shared so many heartaches together.

354
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:41,887
So, I want the three of us
to have a chance at happiness.

00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,224
Or maybe it's my pride.

00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,395
<i>Their tumultuous 300 days</i>
