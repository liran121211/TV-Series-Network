00:00:02,535 --> 00:00:06,439
{\an8}<i>Shigeaki Kato has something
that he will never forget.</i>

2
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:09,743
During elementary school...

3
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:13,380
there was a story about a goose named Gan,

4
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:15,181
who gets shot by a hunter.

5
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:17,917
{\an8}It was in the textbook.
What was it called...

6
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,887
{\an8}Anyway, it's a story.

7
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:24,057
{\an8}Our teacher read that to us
in elementary school,

8
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:27,527
{\an8}and we had to share our thoughts
about it by drawing a picture.

9
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:30,897
And so, even though
it's not in the story at all,

10
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:33,933
I drew a picture of a present.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,703
I drew a present
with a bow on it and everything.

12
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:40,640
I turned that in,
and when all the drawings were posted up,

13
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:43,009
almost everyone had drawn a bird.

14
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:45,245
They drew a scene from the book.

15
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:47,714
I remember thinking,
"Those aren't thoughts."

16
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:49,182
And that stuck in my mind.

17
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:51,117
You drew a boxed present?

18
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:53,319
-Yes.
-What was the meaning behind that?

19
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:56,656
To me, it felt like
I had received a present.

20
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,725
-I see what you mean.
-Yeah.

21
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:02,562
I felt that I received a present,
so that's what I drew.

22
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:06,900
But when I saw that everyone
had drawn a bird,

23
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:13,339
it made me feel sad,
but at the same time I was...

24
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,508
determined to never to draw a bird.

25
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:19,979
I never want to be
the type of person that draws a bird.

26
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:23,016
I still remember that
from elementary school.

27
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:26,252
That always comes to mind
when I write a novel.

28
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:27,454
Really?

29
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:32,092
{\an8}<i>His debut novel was released
when he was 25.</i>

30
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:33,793
{\an8}<i>About 450,000 copies</i>

31
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,862
{\an8}<i>were printed.</i>

32
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:40,733
<i>But what made him think of
writing a novel to begin with?</i>

33
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:42,902
I had this vague idea

34
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:47,207
to write a novel by the time I was 25.

35
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,475
That's one reason.

36
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:51,311
But I think

37
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:55,982
the real reason is
that I did it for NEWS.

38
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,951
You know, back then...

39
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:02,555
Back then we had more members
than we do now.

40
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:06,893
We didn't know what would happen next.

41
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:11,498
I felt like I wasn't contributing
anything to the group,

42
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:14,167
even though I was part of it.

43
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,138
So I went to the office
to ask for more work.

44
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:20,507
Then,

45
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:24,043
they asked me what it was that I could do.

46
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:26,412
I was part of the group,

47
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,915
but I had to do something to be there.

48
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,551
I thought that writing a novel

49
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:33,553
would be something...

50
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:40,527
that I could take responsibility for.

51
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:46,799
I knew some people may criticize it,
but then some might enjoy it too.

52
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:50,803
I figured some people would admire me
for trying something new.

53
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:54,207
I thought that it would be
wrong to give up

54
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:56,676
before trying it out first.

55
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:20,900

Cigarettes!

104
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,929
Would cigarettes be better?

105
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:39,298
What should I do...

00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:47,874

in the beginning of the story.

110
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:53,379
I messed up.

111
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:57,450
She could've gotten it back,
but she's already using it...

112
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:02,588
<i>It will be inconsistent
if he chooses the phone.</i>

113
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:05,958
<i>But, since Kato doesn't smoke,</i>

114
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:08,728
<i>he can't find a reason
for it to be cigarettes.</i>

115
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:13,966
Do people turn to e-cigarettes

116
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:16,235
after they quit smoking?

117
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:17,904
It's possible.

118
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,339
<i>He starts asking many questions.</i>

119
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:23,876
A lot of single mothers smoke, right?

120
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:24,777
Oh yeah, lots.

121
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:28,848
I bet you'll see a lot of people using
e-cigarettes at a school reunion.

122
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:29,582
Yeah.

123
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:31,651
If it's a regular cigarette,

124
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:33,586
even if someone left it behind,

125
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,922
you wouldn't return it
to the owner, right?

126
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:38,458
-The person would just buy another one.
-They would.

127
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:40,526
But if it's an e-cigarette...

128
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,062
Someone may return it.

129
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,466
{\an8}<i>After that discussion,</i>

130

00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:05,151
It must be hard to write about something

134
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:08,120
you haven't personally
experienced yourself.

135
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:11,757
I'm thankful I can work
while asking these questions.

136
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:14,660
It's like an informal interview.

137
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:16,662
There are always people around,

138
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:18,898
so I'm always asking questions.

139
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:22,635
But in the end,
I'm the one who has to write it.

140
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:24,837
But really, what should I do?

141
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:26,506

142
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:29,208

near the platform where we're standing?

-The middle's fine, I think.
-Then how about...

161

Should we put something here?

162
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:33,806
Nobody can see it there. It's too small.

163

closes in on us it will show the railing.

00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:06,906
We'd like all of you
to clap with us to the beat.

173
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:08,474
Everyone, please get ready.

174
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:10,343
Let's put everything down.

175
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,512
-I'm putting down my mic.
-No, keep that.

176
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:15,214
-Oh, okay.
-Please.

177
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:17,183
Everyone, both hands up.

178
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,552
And now,
Tego-chan will tell you what to do.

179
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:22,421
Thank you for the introduction.

180
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:23,923
I am Tego-nyan. Thank you.

181
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:26,926
Why do I feel like
this will take a while?

182
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:29,095
You can just do it right away.

183
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:32,098
-And I will put my mic―
-Never mind that.

184
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:35,334
<i>But in the past...</i>

185
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:40,806
I had this great fear towards being...

186
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:42,174
the MC.

187
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:43,709
Every time,

188
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:47,380
I'd be shaking from nervousness.

189
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:51,384
<i>Koyama is still searching for a solution,</i>

190
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,219
<i>so he meets up with someone.</i>

191
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,521
-I'm Koyama.
-Long time no see.

192
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:57,023
-Sorry.
-I'll be in your care.

193
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,493
{\an8}<i>That someone
is Yoshihiko Inohara from V6.</i>

194
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:05,631
Whenever I'm struggling with something,
you're who I imagine talking with.

195
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:07,700
Really? Glad to hear that.

196
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:10,636
I debuted 15 years ago.

197
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:12,038
We had nine members,

198
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:14,674
and there was a talking segment
during the concert.

199
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,875
Yes.

200
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:16,776
But...

201
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,412
we didn't know who would do the talking

202
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:21,047
or who would take the lead.

203
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:22,982
It was a big disaster

204
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:25,451
during that first concert.

205
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,320
Just as I was thinking about what to do,

206
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:29,922
I was looking at a magazine

207
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:31,857
and read your interview.

208
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:33,292
You had said

209
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:36,962
that you take notes
of things your group members do.

210
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,466
You said that you try to observe them.

211
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,534
I read that excerpt

212
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,170
from the magazine.

213
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:46,839
I knew I had found my answer.

214
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:53,145
{\an8}<i>By observing his group members
and making them part of his skit,</i>

215
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,681
{\an8}<i>the talking segment greatly improved.</i>

216
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:56,949
He's trying so hard.

217
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:58,317
I wanted to bring something up.

218
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:01,387
Tegoshi, the shower
isn't just yours to use.

219
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:03,956
-I usually go after you.
-Yeah.

220
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:06,125
I'm always cleaning up after you.

221
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:07,860
-No way.
-You trash it.

222
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:08,761
Is it dirty?

223
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:11,030
There's body wash all over the walls.

224
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:13,232
-But I rinse the walls off―
-Sorry, hold on.

225
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:14,400
Are you listening, Shige?

226
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,135
I am, I am.

227
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:20,206
I was quiet because I might be
the one who's guilty of that.

228
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,540
It's you?

229
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,144
We all learned to banter with each other.

230
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:26,178
Yeah, yeah.

231
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:29,749
Before, I was just glad
if they'd even respond to my questions.

232
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:31,450
I told them to keep their mic up.

233
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:32,718
-I get that.
-Do you?

234
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:33,686
If not,

235
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:35,454
they can't maintain the tempo,

236
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:38,624
or keep up with the conversation.

237
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:41,694
If their mic is down
when you ask them a question...

238
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:45,297
-"Why yes..." It stops the flow.
-Yes.

239
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,967
-Isn't that right?
-Yeah.

240
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:55,040
But actually, I came to realize
that the pause is part of the fun.

241
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:59,411
Because this rhythm
is just my own personal rhythm.

242
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:00,212
Right.

243
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:02,414
Everyone is different.

244
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:05,584
When it all comes together,

245
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:07,720
it will break the rhythm,

246
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:11,590
but that's what makes it funny,
and you have to enjoy that.

247
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:13,893
-That's what I try to keep in mind.
-I see.

248
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:18,898
<i>For Koyama,
Inohara is eight years his senior.</i>

249
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:21,734
Everyone has this image of you

250
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,170
as someone outgoing and nice.

251
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:25,838
I'm sure you get that often.

252
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:28,507
-Yeah.
-And we all think that too.

253
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:31,811
But I'm sure you also
worry about things or feel down.

254
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:34,213
-Right.
-Do you get like that too?

255
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,415
-I used to. But not anymore.
-Oh, is that right?

256
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,150
Well, not completely.

257
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:42,588
I learned to have fun and to be happy.

258
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:44,890
I hate to say this,

259
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,092
but I realized that I'm really a good guy.

260
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:48,928
Just yesterday.

261
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:50,930
That's recent.

262
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:53,799
-No, you see―
-You're lucky.

263
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,836
I was responding to a text.

264
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:00,239
There are people who text
with a serious face.

265
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:01,140
Yeah.

266
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:05,244
They're typing "hello" using cute emojis.

267
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,212
Yeah.

268
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:08,480
But they still have a serious face.

269
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:09,782
But...

270
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,685
I was smiling
while typing a smiling emoji.

271
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,922
I was expressing my honest feelings
in that text.

272
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:20,159
Did someone tell you
that you were smiling?

273
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:22,061
No, I realized it myself.

274
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:26,131
That felt great.

275
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:30,135
I hope when I get to your age,
I'll be smiling while texting too.

276
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:33,305
Please do.

277
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:35,641
Please continue to support us.

278
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,277
-Thank you.
-No, no, thank you for your time.

279
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:39,578
-Work hard.
-Thank you.

280
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:40,613
Thank you.

{\an8}NOV. 21, 2018 EARLY MORNING
<i>THE INUGAMI FAMILY</i> FILMING

282
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,484
{\an8}-Good morning.
-Good morning.

283
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:49,889
{\an8}<i>Shigeaki Kato has been chosen to play
the Heisei Era's last Kosuke Kindaichi.</i>

284
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:52,057
-It's Shigeaki.
-Thank you!

285
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:54,526
<i>He begins filming as the lead role.</i>

286
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:59,164
-And here we go.
-Let's go... Action!

287
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:04,603
<i>The filming starts with the last scene.</i>

288
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:11,076
<i>After solving a case,</i>

289
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,545
<i>Kindaichi leaves town.</i>

290
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:19,084
It suddenly starts from the last scene.

291
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:22,721
I'm glad I can build this character

292
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:28,727
by filming a walking scene first
instead of a scene with lines.

293
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:30,796
This is a gravel road.

294
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:34,266
-It's so hard to walk on it.
-With the geta?

295
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:36,468
You don't usually...

296
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:39,271
But not being used to walking like this
might be true to his character.

297
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:41,507
He's not the type who can
smoothly walk on gravel.

298
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:42,308
I see.

299
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:44,109
-He's a bit clumsy.
-Oh, I see.

300
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,613
No matter what it is he's doing,

301
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:51,483
he can't do it very gracefully.

302
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:54,687
-That's what I'm trying to portray.
-Ah, I see.

303
00:15:55,854 --> 00:16:00,926
<i>How to act out his interpretation
of Kosuke Kindaichi...</i>

304
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:03,028
<i>That's what he's been thinking of</i>

305
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:05,064
<i>since long before filming began.</i>

306
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:06,498
Is the room upstairs?

307
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,133
Yes.

308
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:11,737
Someone once said,
"The Kindaichi you portray is too pretty."

309
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:14,640
I was frustrated by that comment.

310
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:18,377
It was never my intention
to create a pretty character.

311
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:22,414
Acting while trying
to make myself look cool

312
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:24,350
is just lame.

313
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:26,685
I've always thought that.

314
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:30,923
This Kindaichi is endearing
because he doesn't try to act cool.

315
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,425
I think that's the appeal.

316
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:35,127
And start!

317
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:38,330
<i>He wants to portray this character
as someone people can relate to.</i>

318
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:42,601
<i>It shows his passion for his work.</i>

319
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:45,838
Every job that I do,

320
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:48,640
I do it thinking it's my last.

321
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:50,476
You never know what will happen.

322
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:51,643
Every day.

323
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:55,814
I don't want to have any regrets,
even if this is my last piece of work.

324
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:57,783
So I give it my all.

325
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,388

{\an8}PRODUCER, KENSAKU SAWADA

328
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:10,963
If you do nothing,

329
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:15,100
the person you tried to protect
will be made the culprit.

330
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,205
Aren't you...

331
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:22,808
the real culprit?

332
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,179
Instead of bluntly pointing out
the culprit,

333
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:28,714
he's more kind.

334
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:32,151
He asks, "Aren't you the culprit?"

335
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:34,253
He's kind-mannered.

336
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:37,823
He doesn't talk in a demanding way.

337
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:38,957
He...

338
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:41,393
sits down each time.

339
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:45,497
He sits down near them.
Being at eye level is important.

will be made the culprit.

347
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:14,226
Aren't you...

348
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,662
the real culprit?

349
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:22,134
No! Mother!

350
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:23,469
What happened?

351
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,271
There was poison in this cigarette.

352
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,740
It's the same one Mr. Wakabayashi smokes.

353
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:31,844
Call the doctor!

354
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:38,250
<i>Meanwhile, Tegoshi pays a visit to
what could be called his starting point.</i>

355
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:39,952
Hold on.

356
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,255
This isn't the Mei-naka that I know.

357
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:45,691
This is your alma mater, right?

358
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:47,059
Yes, it is.

359
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:48,927
See, it's written here.

360
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:52,164
Meiji University Nakano Junior High
and High School.

361
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:55,167
I attended from first year junior high
to my first year of high school.

362
00:18:56,735 --> 00:19:01,907
{\an8}<i>His alma mater has transformed,
after it was renovated six years ago.</i>

363
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:06,812
Wow, seriously?

364
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:08,614
It looks like a university.

365
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:10,048
It's so different.

366
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:13,051
<i>The soccer field he used to play on
has changed too.</i>

367
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:15,921
Wait, hold on.

368
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:18,090
It's turf?

369
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:21,527
No way.

370
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,462
Hold on, it's turf now?

371
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,199
<i>It has transformed into a splendid field</i>

372
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:28,867
<i>with artificial turf grass.</i>

373
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:31,436
<i>Back then,</i>

374
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,106
<i>Tegoshi was devoted to soccer.</i>

375
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:38,544
The work and the result are all on me.
You don't do it for anyone else.

376
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:41,446
I wanted to be on the team, have fun,

377
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,048
and win as a team.

378
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:45,684
I was playing soccer
to share in that joy.

379
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:48,654
The time I spent here
and the memories I made

380
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,023
with everyone
like my team and the teachers,

381
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:54,293
had a great influence on me.

382
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,562
<i>At that moment...</i>

383
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:59,164
-Hey, can you aim better?
-Sorry.

384
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:01,133
-I'll come closer.
-What?

385
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:03,235
Want to join?

386
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,571
Who? Who are they?

387
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:08,774
-Kadoya?
-That's me.

388
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:10,475
What are you doing?

389
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,977
And that's Michiki!

390
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,912
-Good to see you.
-Why're you here?

391
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:15,981
-Practicing.
-What are you doing?

392
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,816
-I'm here filming something.
-Oh.

393
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,284
Congrats on your wedding.

394
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:23,889
{\an8}I heard about that.

395
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:26,391
{\an8}<i>They are former teammates</i>

396
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,760
{\an8}<i>that he played with in junior high,</i>

397
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:30,963
{\an8}<i>Michiki and Kadoya.</i>

398
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:33,065
I'd go to your house a lot.

399
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:34,933
-And I would spend the night.
-We would both go there.

400
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,901
-That's right.
-Yeah, yeah.

401
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:38,003
{\an8}-Since they owned a bathhouse.
-Yeah, we'd both use it.

402
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,905
{\an8}I thought you'd come by to use it again.

403
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:40,973
{\an8}That's right, I did say that.

404
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:42,908
We were on the regular team...

405
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,209
for a long time.

406
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:47,512
Tegoshi would pass
the ball to Kadoya, and I'd block it,

407
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:48,747
so that you could score a goal.

408
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:50,048
That's right.

409
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:54,353
Only the good players made the team,
no matter what grade you were in.

410
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:56,421
When Chami was the coach,

411
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:00,859
-he'd choose those who practiced hard.
-Yeah, he did.

412
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,795
We were lucky in that sense.

413
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:07,799
-Should we go for a run?
-Seriously? There's no way I'm running.

414
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:11,203
-Let's run.
-That scared me!

415
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,838
It's been forever!

416
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,707
-Good to see you.
-It's good to see you again.

417
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,676
This is Coach Usami.

418
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:20,846
Wow, I was not expecting him to come out.

419
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:25,617
-Seriously?
-Do you remember him too?

420
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,719
-About Tegoshi?
-Of course.

421
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,688
-Really?
-What kind of student was he?

422
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,658
He hated to lose.

423
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:36,361
I'd tell him to juggle,
and he would go on forever.

424
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:39,631
-Maybe about 500 times.
-I did.

425
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,167
<i>It has been 16 years</i>

426
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:44,736
<i>since they kicked a ball around
in this nostalgic place.</i>

427
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:47,973
Whoa, it's hard!

428
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:52,944
<i>He learned something by spending time</i>

429
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:54,880
<i>with his team here.</i>

430
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,319
It was like living under the same roof.

431
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:05,023
The time we spent outside of soccer,
like at lunch time or on the way home,

432
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:09,961
all contributed to teamwork
and led the team to victory.

433
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:11,596
Now ten years later,

434
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:14,499
I get to see my former coach
and my teammates,

435
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:17,169
whom I played with on this field.

436
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:21,073
It's brought me back to my roots.

437
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:23,342
This was a nice experience.

438
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:25,711
-All right!
-Okay!

439
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:28,747
{\an8}<i>On the next</i> Ride On Time<i>...</i>

440
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:31,416
{\an8}<i>It's the concert they've been
preparing for.</i>

441
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:36,088
{\an8}<i>On the night of New Year's Eve,</i>

442
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:38,924
{\an8}<i>over 50,000 people come
to attend the concert.</i>

443
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:02,414
{\an8}<i>Hear the emotion NEWS
puts into their song, "Ikiro".</i>

444
