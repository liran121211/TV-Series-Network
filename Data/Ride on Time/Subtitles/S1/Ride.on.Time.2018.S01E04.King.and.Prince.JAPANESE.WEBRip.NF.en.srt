00:00:01,735 --> 00:00:04,838
<i>"This is a record of youths</i>

2
00:00:04,904 --> 00:00:08,508
<i>who devoted their adolescence
to entertainment."</i>

3
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:11,111
Cut it out.

4
00:00:11,644 --> 00:00:13,346
Stop playing around.

5
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:18,852
<i>Because they take it seriously,
because they trust each other,</i>

6
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:20,387
<i>sometimes they clash.</i>

7
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:25,392
When I think about what would've happened
if I didn't join Johnny's

8
00:00:25,925 --> 00:00:28,428
and gave up on
becoming a pro, it scares me.

9
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:33,700
<i>What is it that awaits them?</i>

10
00:00:57,157 --> 00:01:00,860
<i>This is documentary series</i> Ride On Time.

11
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:06,199
<i>The debut of King & Prince
was announced in January.</i>

12
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:11,604
<i>The six of them, who were just
regular youths up to now,</i>

13
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:15,508
<i>will embark on the craziest
adventure of their lives.</i>

14
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:19,779
{\an8}So many died.

15
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,883
{\an8}I want everyone who is connected
with me to stay alive.

16
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:28,288
<i>The bitter memories
that became their driving force.</i>

17
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:31,424
{\an8}He surpassed me and others.

18
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:33,927
{\an8}I was speechless.

19
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:37,363
{\an8}Dancing before a crowd
only brought me stress.

20
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,834
{\an8}We realized that nothing could
bring us down any further.

21
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,436
{\an8}I think I used up
a lifetime's worth of tears.

22
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,308
<i>Together they've overcome
trials and uncertainty</i>

23
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:51,711
<i>and made their way
to their big performance.</i>

24
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:56,216
I feel like it's finally showtime.

<i>August 9th.</i>

27
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:24,944
<i>The day before the opening day
of their concert tour,</i>

28
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:27,013
<i>they held a rehearsal.</i>

29
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:30,683
-Good morning.
-Morning.

30
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:32,452
Good morning.

31
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:37,290
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

32
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:39,959
<i>Twenty-one shows in five cities</i>

33
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:42,328
<i>is out of the ordinary for a new group.</i>

34
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,199
-Is that honey?
-Yes, it is.

35
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,936
My throat isn't that strong.

36
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,771
Actually, it's really weak.

37
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:56,309
Which one? I accidentally
poured coffee last time.

38
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:59,479
This is coffee. Thank goodness
I checked. This is the one.

39
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,550
Kaito, Jinguji, Genki.

40
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:06,920
<i>More than ten thousand fans
will fill this arena.</i>

41
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:10,156
<i>It's the biggest show
they've done by themselves.</i>

42
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:11,791
Can you go to the center?

43
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:15,028
-This is really long.
-It really is.

44
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:20,567
<i>They've set up trolleys
on the second floor.</i>

45
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:27,106
We said we wanted to be
as close to the fans,

46
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:29,976
and see each one of them,
as much as possible.

47
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:32,979
Spread out more.

48
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,113
Is 2,5 better?

49
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,748
<i>They want their feelings</i>

50
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,184
<i>to reach every corner of the arena.</i>

51
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:48,528
<i>Another thing they will experience
for the first time</i>

52
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,965
<i>is the sound reverberation
unique to large arenas.</i>

53
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:59,439
What should I do to stay
on the original beat of the song?

54
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:01,241
-Do you need a click track?
-Yes.

55
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:04,043
It's so new to me. The echo is so loud.

59
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:15,722
<i>He is especially overjoyed.</i>

60
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:18,124
Did you make amends?

61
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:21,494
In the pamphlet for this concert,

62
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:27,433
there is a part that asks us
who we were most influenced by.

63
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:30,570
In my interview,

64
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,006
I answered Jinguji.

65
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:37,577
I wrote that he has supported me the most

66
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:40,647
since we were Johnny's Jr. members
and has always been by my side.

67
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,448
I don't remember saying that.

68
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:45,218
It's kind of embarrassing.

69
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:49,722
-See you.
-Okay, thank you.

{\an8}<i>It's opening day.</i>

72
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:04,037
<i>The arena was buzzing with excitement.</i>

73
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:10,810
<i>We asked Hirano how he's feeling,</i>

74
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,179
<i>and he gave us a unique answer.</i>

75
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:17,383
I don't see them as complete strangers.

76
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:18,851
The fans, I mean.

77
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:20,953
They're closer...

78
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:24,023
I know I shouldn't,
but I see them as relatives.

79
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,159
But I want to look good in front of them.

80
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:27,560
It's like Sports Day!

81
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,263
Like doing your best in the relay race

82
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:32,231
because your family is there.

83
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,266
No?

00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:36,436
<i>Fifteen minutes until showtime.</i>

85
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:39,005
<i>They can't hide their excitement.</i>

86
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:41,174
All right!

87
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:45,511
To the right.

88
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,882
One, two, one, two!

89
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:54,887
-Let's go!
-No, no!

90
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,359
<i>Right before showtime...</i>

91
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,829
Genki, Ren insists that we form a huddle.

92
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:05,064
-Here he is.
-Sorry.

93
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:07,700
Please catch this on camera. This is rare.

94
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:11,738
At last, it's King & Prince's
first concert.

95
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:14,340
-Must we do this?
-Yes.

96
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:16,743
-Let's do it.
-Bear with me.

97
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:19,145
It's a special beginning for us.

98
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,913
Without making mistakes, let's―

99
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,081
I might mess up.

100
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:24,417
-Kishi, don't stop him!
-We'll try not to!

101
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:27,920
-Let's go!
-Yeah!

102
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:30,423
-Let's go, everyone.
-Let's do this.

103
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,059
I want a rice ball.

104
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,562
You found one? Yeah!

105
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:39,565
TEN MINUTES UNTIL SHOWTIME

106
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:41,234
<i>He eats right before showtime.</i>

107
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,604
You're eating a rice ball?

108
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:47,607
What's inside?

109
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,176
I suddenly became so hungry.

110
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:53,579
Here I go.

111
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:55,581
I'll hype up the crowd.

112
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:58,050
-Break a leg.
-Bye.

Yokohama Arena!

00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:12,992
This is our first concert!

119
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,161
Make some noise!

120
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:17,864
Are you ready?

121
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:20,299
Here we go.

{\an8}KATSUNDA WIN!

123
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,498
{\an8}Hey, Yokohama Arena!

124
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:55,535
{\an8}Relieve yourself from your stress!
Let's go!

125
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:59,105
{\an8}<i>In just three months since their debut,</i>

126
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:00,940
{\an8}<i>they've made a big achievement.</i>

127
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:03,442
<i>But their journey here</i>

128
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:06,145
<i>was anything but smooth.</i>

129
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:15,154
{\an8}SUMMER STATION

130
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:19,358
{\an8}<i>Three years ago, they formed a unit</i>

131
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:22,495
{\an8}<i>under the name Mr. King vs Mr. Prince.</i>

132
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:28,701
{\an8}<i>They hoped to debut once</i>

133
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:31,804
{\an8}<i>but were divided into two units
the following year.</i>

134
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,108
{\an8}Here we go!

135
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:42,014
{\an8}<i>The reason why they were able to</i>

136
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,683
{\an8}<i>debut despite that fact</i>

137
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:47,019
{\an8}<i>was because they shared a strong bond.</i>

138
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:51,991
{\an8}HELLO!!! HARUIRO

139
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,927
People have called it
a direct negotiation,

140
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:57,830
but what actually happened was

141
00:09:57,897 --> 00:10:00,333
we went to the president for advice.

142
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,535
He asked, "What do you want to do?"

143
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:07,173
For us to have a stable job,
we thought that

144
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:09,175
we would need to debut.

145
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:12,912
From there,
Mr. Johnny did everything for us.

146
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:16,349
And next thing we knew,
we were called to the press conference.

147
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:19,652
Every single member

148
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:23,322
has a strong sense of self
and his own beliefs.

149
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:25,157
Each one of us

150
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:27,126
can help each other grow

151
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:29,729
and become a unified team.

152
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:32,164
We're a balanced group like that.

153
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:33,966
That's how I feel.

154
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:38,671
All six of us are very unique
and have our own strengths.

155
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:41,474
The six of us would talk about it often.

156
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:45,211
Debuting is one of the goals
of any Johnny's Jr. member,

157
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:46,479
so I was really happy.

158
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:48,147
And now that we have,

159
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,783
I have a sense of awareness
that this is going to be

160
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:52,551
my life from now on.

161
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:56,789
The members are so important to me.

162
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:59,925
Out of the six of us,
it's as if the five of them

163
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,028
are in front of me

164
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:05,831
and pulling me forward.

165
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:07,600
As long as I'm with them,

166
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,403
I have nothing to fear.

167
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:12,638
We started working

168
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:15,141
together with Mr. King,

169
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:17,510
and it was...

170
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,780
our first time working together,

171
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:23,516
but it didn't feel like it at all.

172
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:27,787
I took away a lot from that experience.

173
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,856
I could feel a different kind of power

174
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:34,093
awakening in me,
and I was ready to use it.

175
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:39,098
You never know if you will
pass the auditions,

176
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:41,033
and you aren't even told if you do.

177
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,636
And we don't know who or when

178
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,504
someone will debut.

179
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:48,441
We were struggling in a situation...

180
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,177
where we had no answers.

181
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:54,513
{\an8}AUGUST 12TH, 2018
YOKOHAMA, KANAGAWA

182
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,616
{\an8}<i>Their last day at Yokohama Arena.</i>

183
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:02,555
Good morning.

184
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,225
<i>Each member</i>

185
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:09,228
<i>is experiencing fatigue like never before.</i>

186
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:19,004
<i>They've already sung
more than 100 songs within two days.</i>

187
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,376
<i>For the members,</i>

188
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:26,445
<i>this room has become an oasis.</i>

189
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,247
-My back doesn't hurt that much.
-Not your back?

190
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:31,717
As I expected,

191
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:33,719
I completely lost my voice.

192
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,690
<i>They treat them using acupuncture.</i>

193
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:41,393
<i>He is having trouble using his voice
because of fatigue.</i>

194
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:43,963
Do you have back pain often?

195
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:45,664
Not really.

196
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,568
<i>Jinguji, on the other hand...</i>

197
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:51,670
What is up with my calf?

198
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:54,173
It's so swollen.

199
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,152
{\an8}AUGUST 17TH, 2018
OSAKA

200
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:10,556
<i>On this day, they needed to change
a part of the performance.</i>

201
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:17,496
{\an8}<i>The song where each member is introduced</i>

202
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:19,098
{\an8}<i>has a part that needs fixing.</i>

203
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,209
<i>It is the call and response part where</i>

204
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:31,777
<i>Kishi introduces Nagase.</i>

205
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:38,584
Say Nagase...

206
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,586
<i>The fans can't get the timing right.</i>

207
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,791
<i>After the show, they held a meeting.</i>

208
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:51,263
I think this part...

209
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,665
...is difficult.

210
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:56,402
You're saying, "He's so sexy, say!" right?

211
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:59,872
I think that part confuses the fans.

212
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:02,474
They don't know where to say Ren's name.

213
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,710
Everybody say Ren.

214
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:07,446
Ren, Ren, Ren.

215
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:10,349
Something something, Nagase Ren.

216
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,586
-Everybody, everybody, Ren.
-You don't get it!

217
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:16,188
Everybody say Ren.

218
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:18,958
You have to say Ren first, so they know.

219
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,794
Everybody say Ren.

220
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,395
Ren.

221
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:25,097
Try it once.

222
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:26,732
Here we go.

223
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:29,335
-Everybody, ready...
-No.

224
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,737
No, no, no. You have to say Ren.

225
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:34,273
-Everybody say Ren.
-Everybody say Ren-kun.

226
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:37,042
-Ren-kun.
-Why do you add a "kun" at the end?

227
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:38,944
Just say Ren.

228
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:42,147
Everybody say Ren.

229
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:44,650
Everybody say...

230
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,819
Everybody say Ren.

231
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:47,620
Ren.

232
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:49,188
-Ren.
-Ren.

233
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:50,756
Looking good, Nagase Ren.

234
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:52,258
-I've got it.
-Why do I...

235
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:53,425
have to be after him?

236
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:55,494
{\an8}<i>Everyone's favorite, Kishi Yuta</i>

237
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,763
{\an8}<i>The following day...</i>

238
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:05,104
<i>Everybody say Ren!</i>

239
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:07,139
<i>Ren!</i>

240
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:11,443
<i>Nagase Ren!</i>

241
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:19,418
If I do it so that
I don't have any regrets,

242
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:22,321
and I'm satisfied with how much I did,

243
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:25,257
then even if my hard work doesn't pay off,

244
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:28,227
I can still accept that.

245
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:30,663
I have a feeling I can still

246
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:33,132
reach my goal eventually.

247
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,703
-We'll do our best.
-Break a leg.

248
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:38,737
Fist bump.

249
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:44,176
{\an8}SEPTEMBER 22ND, 2018
SENDAI

250
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:48,280
{\an8}<i>And at last, it's the final day
of their tour.</i>

251
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:54,753
<i>It may be because it's the final day,</i>

252
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:57,990
<i>but the youngest member,
Takahashi, looks thoughtful.</i>

253
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,827
When I saw it for the first time,
I was so surprised.

254
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:05,331
I couldn't believe they would
make something like this for us.

255
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:07,566
It's so elaborate.

256
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:11,904
Performing on this set
is so much fun for us too.

257
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,211
<i>But the one who has been dealing
with uncertainty more than anyone</i>

258
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,546
<i>is Takahashi.</i>

259
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:22,581
I can't believe it's our last day.

260
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:26,251
I just don't have a lot of
self-confidence.

261
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,954
That's how I am. Every day,

262
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:32,358
I would go home and cry.
And after the concerts,

263
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:33,792
I would cry.

264
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:35,794
{\an8}NAKANO, TOKYO

265
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:38,030
{\an8}<i>After Takahashi joined Johnny's,</i>

266
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:40,432
<i>he led a busy life
as a Johnny's Jr. member</i>

267
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,700
<i>during high school.</i>

268
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:46,638
<i>Back then, there was someone
who helped him.</i>

269
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:50,342
Long time no see.

270
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,211
Wow.

271
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:54,947
Please have a seat.

272
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,682
<i>When he was feeling unsure</i>

273
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:58,717
{\an8}<i>while juggling work and school,</i>

274
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:01,653
{\an8}<i>the one to always offer a listening ear</i>

275
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,455
{\an8}<i>was his teacher, Tadashi Nakao.</i>

276
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:07,393
I remember Mr. Nakao was
one of the only people

277
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:10,829
who always looked out for me.

278
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:14,466
He always knew when I was tired.

279
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:17,136
He could tell if I was up late at night.

280
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:20,806
Every day, I would talk to him
about my work,

281
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,809
as if I was reporting to him.

282
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,944
That's right. You did that a lot.

283
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:29,615
-You would tell me your plans for the day.
-And what I did that day.

284
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:32,518
I haven't looked at it since I graduated.

285
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:33,619
You haven't?

286
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:37,923
<i>A yearbook full of memories.</i>

287
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,092
There I am.

288
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:42,561
The very last row?

289
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:45,497
The very back. The very back
of the entertainment course.

290
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:48,567
<i>Many days he would be tardy
or have to leave early,</i>

291
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:50,636
<i>but he had one rule.</i>

292
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:52,438
This brings back memories.

293
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:54,506
But you rarely missed school.

294
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,642
I didn't miss school.

295
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:00,646
I felt like I had to do well
at school too.

296
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:03,215
If I didn't get good marks on tests

297
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:06,452
or get good grades,
I would feel really frustrated.

298
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:11,657
One time on a test, I came in
first place in my entire grade,

299
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:13,659
and I bragged about it to everyone.

300
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,795
I told everyone I'm a Johnny's member.

301
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:19,498
Really? You didn't seem like the type.

302
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:23,969
<i>Mr. Nakao</i>

303
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:26,772

304
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:28,874
<i>now that he has debuted.</i>

305
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:32,744
-This.
-Wow.

306
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:35,547
{\an8}I'm so happy.

307
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:36,982
{\an8}LAUGHTER, APPRECIATION

308
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:38,450
{\an8}Oh, wow.

309
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:43,222
These are things
that I like to keep in mind

310
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,390
as an idol.

311
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:47,860
{\an8}LAUGHTER, APPRECIATION,
AND HARD WORK PAY OFF

312
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:52,297
{\an8}One second. When I went
to your place,

313
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:54,533
you gave me one.

314
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:57,269
I brought it.

315
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:59,638
Now I have a complete set.

316
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:03,876
They have a magical power.
It makes me realize that

317
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:07,012
it's important for me
to always be smiling.

318
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,515
-That's right.
-Yes.

319
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:11,216
That's what an idol is to me.

320
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:15,053
All right, say cheese!

321
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,757

00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:37,476
<i>A photo with the people who've

326
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:41,813
I've always wanted to do this.

00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:45,584
Thank you so much

328
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:47,319
for all your hard work.

329
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:51,089
Thanks to the support of
each and every one of you,

330
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:52,758
we are able to stand here.

331
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:56,728
I hope we can work together
from now on too.

332
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,298
-Go ahead, Kishi.
-Okay.

333
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:03,502
All right, say cheese!

Here we go.

336
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:18,684
See you later.

337
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:25,624
<i>What is it that awaits them?</i>

338
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:29,761
When the time comes that any of us

339
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:34,166
could be the face of the group,
we'll be invincible.

340
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:38,570
I want to find
our strength quickly and fortify it,

341
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:42,608
to make it so no one can beat us.

342
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:45,177
That's my goal.

343
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:47,913
I hope we can all stay friends.

344
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:53,619
That will always show in our performances.

345
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:57,723
I want to become an adult
who can proudly say

346
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:01,560
I am in King & Prince,
even when I'm an old man.

347
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:04,830
I hope I can stay
charming enough to say that.

348
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:08,734
I want to stay like this forever.

349
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,371
The six of us. A little shy

350
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,972
and close-knit.

351
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:17,876
I want to be able to support each other
while also being able to

352
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:23,015
stand on our own two feet.
That would be ideal.

353
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:27,686
Instead of walking down
someone else's road,

354
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:30,622
I want to create our very own road

355
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:33,058
and become a group like no other.

356
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,295
We are...

357
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:39,731
King & Prince!

358
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:43,402
Thank you.

359
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:50,909
RIGHT AFTER THE SHOW

360
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,977
Encore!

361
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:53,478
What if we left?

362
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:54,746
If we just left...

363
00:21:58,216 --> 00:22:00,452
Well, of course we have to go out.

364
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:02,454
Let's go.

365
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:37,255
<i>King & Prince, the six of them</i>

366
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:39,157
<i>have just begun their journey.</i>

367
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,297
<i>On the next</i> Ride On Time<i>,</i>

368
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:21,700
<i>we follow four young staff members</i>

369
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:23,268
<i>who work at the concert events.</i>

370
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:28,106
I thought I could do better,

371
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:29,741
but it's not that easy.

372
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:32,911
When I heard the crowd screaming,
it made it all worth it.

373
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,814
<i>They share the same desire</i>

374
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:38,917
<i>to entertain the fans
just like the artists.</i>

375
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:42,554
I don't know how it will work
on the day of, so I'm worried.

376
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:44,623
I don't think I've ever been

377
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:45,991
this nervous before.

378
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:48,360
<i>We see their pride in their work</i>

379
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:51,596
<i>and dedication to the concert.</i>

380
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:59,337
{\an8}<i>Behind the scenes of the concert.
The challenges of new recruits.</i>
