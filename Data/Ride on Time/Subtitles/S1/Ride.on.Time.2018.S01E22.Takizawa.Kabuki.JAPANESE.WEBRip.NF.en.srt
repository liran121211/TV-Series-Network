00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:22,889
This is insane.

{\an8}<i>With a clearly high level
of physical ability,</i>

<i>with a show as graceful
as cherry blossoms.</i>

18
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:35,628
{\an8}<i>It's the ultimate
in traditional Japanese entertainment.</i>

19
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,701
-This is amazing!
-It is.

20
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:43,703

{\an8}A few years ago, I would really never
have believed a day like this would come.

25
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:08,695
I hope to take the audience into the world
of ultimate Japanese entertainment.

{\an8}<i>Snow Man was formed in 2012

I want Snow Man

28
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,272
I hope we can be in an anime.

<i>The boys have closely bonded

<i>Even when a junior group beat them
to make their debut,</i>

<i>they weren't discouraged
and kept aiming for greater heights.</i>

32
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:34,220
{\an8}I want to overcome being unknown.

33
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:36,489
{\an8}I want people to know who we are.

<i>The days before the show's completion</i>

-Good morning!
-Good morning.

45
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:29,943
It's been a while
since we've been in <i>Wink Up!</i>

46
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:34,314
{\an8}<i>Three new members have joined Snow Man,</i>

47
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:36,883
{\an8}<i>meaning they've been reborn
as a nine-man unit.</i>

48
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:39,586
{\an8}3 NEW MEMBERS TURN 6 TO 9

49
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:42,121
You've shaken your nerves loose
quickly, Raul.

50
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:44,123
That's for the best, definitely!

51
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,592
I'm just pretending.

52
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:50,697
<i>The first is a 15-year-old
still in junior high school...</i>

53
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:52,332
{\an8}RAUL (AGE 15)

54
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,000
{\an8}<i>...Raul.</i>

55
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:58,571
{\an8}<i>He will be joining</i> Takizawa Kabuki ZERO
<i>from their Tokyo performance on.</i>

56
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:03,509
<i>This is the second new member.</i>

57
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,981
I think I'll get some food.
Something proper. I'm starving.

58
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:14,587
{\an8}<i>Ren Meguro will be performing
with his other unit, Uchu Six,</i>

59
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:16,356
{\an8}<i>while being part of Snow Man.</i>

60
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:17,490
{\an8}REN MEGURO (AGE 22)

61
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:24,030
{\an8}<i>And the third addition,
a member of Kansai Johnny's Jr. until now,</i>

62
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:25,832
{\an8}<i>Koji Mukai.</i>

63
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:27,467
{\an8}KOJI MUKAI (AGE 24)

64
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:32,372
<i>It goes without saying
that Mukai can sing and dance,</i>

65
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:34,507
<i>but he's also a great talker</i>

66
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:37,977
<i>who will be a valuable asset
as an idol who can make people laugh.</i>

67
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:42,548
Nice smiles, please!

68
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:48,288
<i>Three new members,
and the original lineup of six.</i>

69
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:52,892
{\an8}<i>With a limited amount of time
until the first performance,</i>

70
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:55,328
{\an8}<i>how will these nine solidify their unity?</i>

71
00:04:57,997 --> 00:05:01,901
I think what we have to do now is actually
try out all kinds of things.

72
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:08,941
Surely we need to explore, right?
Now that there's nine of us.

73
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:12,545
We have to find the best way
that will work.

74
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:16,082
<i>Meanwhile,
new member Mukai has this to say.</i>

75
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:21,254
When I first heard,
I was surprised, really.

76
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,790
-I'm sure you were.
-I couldn't believe it.

77
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:30,196
And so as to not drag down
Snow-san as we try to level up,

78
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,132
I want to work really hard.
I felt that strongly.

79
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:36,936
It's not like you to say something
so serious, Koji.

80
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:41,441
{\an8}<i>The one who ties everyone together
and makes sure they all get along</i>

81
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:43,242
{\an8}<i>is Tatsuya Fukazawa.</i>

82
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:44,410
{\an8}TATSUYA FUKAZAWA (AGE 26)

83
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:47,246
Squeaking like this? No way!

84
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:52,618
<i>After this, Mukai will face an ordeal.</i>

85
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:59,959
<i>Today is intensive training
for the all-important opening segment.</i>

86
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:03,963
Thank you.

87
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:07,300
<i>With Meguro unable to join them
due to other work,</i>

88
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,335
<i>they check their formation.</i>

89
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:12,238
<i>It's different from the six-man setup
they're used to.</i>

90
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:16,142
Go! And, jump! That's it.

91
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:19,212
-Let's do it.
-Okay!

92
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:23,082
<i>A new song has been created
for the opening scene,</i>

93
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:26,018
<i>and they must also master
a whole new routine for this.</i>

94
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:33,960
{\an8}<i>The choreography is handled
by Koichi Goseki of A.B.C-Z.</i>

95
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:38,464
{\an8}<i>His superior dancing ability
is acknowledged even within the agency.</i>

96
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,507
<i>The routine is, naturally,
inspired by the cherry blossom.</i>

97
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:52,211
<i>It calls for delicate expressiveness,
right down to subtle hand movements.</i>

98
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,520
-Okay.
-Sorry, can we do it one more time?

99
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:03,689
-It's the hook now.
-The hook, right.

100
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,425
-Okay.
-Let's go.

101
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:08,528
-Sorry, can we do it again?
-Just once?

102
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,263
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

103
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:13,766
<i>The choreography is quite fast.</i>

104
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:22,608
<i>If they lose focus once,
they'll immediately fall behind.</i>

105
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:31,384
{\an8}<i>The next day's practice
is for a new Snow Man song.</i>

106
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:34,787
{\an8}<i>It has a dance number with a high tempo
to keep in time with.</i>

107
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:42,562
<i>Soon unable to keep up with the speed
and starting to suffer</i>

108
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:44,363
<i>is Mukai.</i>

109
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:49,135
It's so fast.

110
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:56,409
<i>Mukai is normally cheerful,</i>

111
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,711
<i>but his smile has vanished.</i>

112
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:04,584
<i>He uses the break to practice alone.</i>

113
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:08,354
One, two, three, four.

114
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:15,294
<i>Unable to stand by watching,
Fukazawa and Sakuma join him.</i>

115
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:18,197
How does the start of the intro go again?

116
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:28,608
As soon as you get it once,
you'll remember it.

117
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,610
It's the start.

118
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:34,013
I'll go over it in my head
at the hotel again today.

119
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:37,850
I'll leave it to sink in overnight.

120
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:41,854
How's it going?

121
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:45,124
There's no time to rest now.

122
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:48,628
Everyone's so fast.

123
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:51,297
Don't you think they move really quickly?

124
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,567
We did it bit by bit in Kansai.

125
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:57,136
One. Two. Three. Like that.

126
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,473
I guess I'm used to having it easier.

127
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:05,645
And there's no time to ask questions
either, is there?

128
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:08,648
It's not so much strenuous
as it is unfamiliar.

129
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:13,853
So, it's tough.

130
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:19,659
<i>Perhaps nervous
or conscious of his inability to keep up,</i>

131
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:22,495
<i>Mukai is spending a lot more time alone.</i>

132
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:29,702
<i>Then this happens.</i>

133
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:31,737
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

134
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:33,472
-You playing, Koji?
-Playing what?

135
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,574
Rock-paper-scissors.

136
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:40,246
<i>It's their traditional lunch game
of rock-paper-scissors to win a burger.</i>

137
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:47,086
<i>It's only a silly game, but over time,
little things like this</i>

138
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,422
<i>strengthen the group's bonds.</i>

139
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:51,190
You're kidding me!

140
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:54,360
<i>Hoping for this closeness more than anyone</i>

141
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,929
<i>is the oldest of the nine,</i>

142
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,665
{\an8}<i>the worldly-wise Tatsuya Fukazawa.</i>

143
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:01,701
{\an8}TATSUYA FUKAZAWA

144
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:04,337
All of my previous groups
broke up in the end,

145
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:07,440
so I've always wanted
to protect this group.

146
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:12,244
And now we've grown by three members,

147
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:13,913
and we're a new Snow Man.

148
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:18,384
If we wanted to be that one step
ahead of other groups,

149
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,454
I figured this would be the only way.

150
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:26,726
{\an8}<i>Fukazawa was formerly a part
of other units,</i>

151
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:31,564
{\an8}<i>but his old band mates debuted
with other groups one after another.</i>

152
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:35,167
{\an8}<i>He felt the bitter sting
of being left behind.</i>

153
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:41,741
<i>They're in Hey! Say! JUMP,
and then there's Hasshy who's in A.B.C-Z.</i>

154
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:45,177
I've thought about giving up
on many occasions.

155
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:47,713
I've thought about giving up a lot,

156
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,650
but I didn't
because of the people I'm with now.

157
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,019
My fellow members of Snow Man.

158
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:59,125
<i>In Fukazawa's eyes,
he's staked his life on Snow Man.</i>

159
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:03,963
<i>And that's precisely why he will make sure</i>
Takizawa Kabuki ZERO<i>...</i>

160
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:06,866
<i>is an absolute success.</i>

161
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:11,504
<i>Fukazawa has come here tonight.</i>

162
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,773
-Awesome!
-They do hot pots.

163
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:15,641
The fried chicken looks great!

164
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,244
Here's to making it a great show.

165
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:21,113
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

166
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:23,783
<i>Joining them at the restaurant</i>

167
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:28,354
<i>are Juniors from Tokyo and Kansai
who are backup dancers for Snow Man.</i>

168
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,528
Most of these guys are from Kansai.

169
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:36,929
It's our first time.

170
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:38,564
Is it "Sawata" or "Sawada"?

171
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:39,799
{\an8}"Ta".

172
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,033
{\an8}MASAYA SAWATA

173
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:42,835
{\an8}-That's tricky.
-Either's fine.

174
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:47,339
<i>To steer</i> Takizawa Kabuki ZERO
<i>towards success,</i>

175
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,477
<i>it's not just the solidarity
of in the band itself that's crucial,</i>

176
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,146
<i>but that of everyone
who will be appearing onstage.</i>

177
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:02,254
Since we're picking up the torch
of <i>Takizawa Kabuki</i>,

178
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:09,595
that means we'll be passing that torch on
to the next generation one day.

179
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,564
So for us in Snow Man,

180
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:16,836
not succeeding would mean
we can't pass it on to them.

181
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:21,107
When it comes down to it,
no matter how badly hurt you are,

182
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:23,275
you have to keep standing up.

183
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:26,512
You have to stand up
and give your best performance.

184
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,382
<i>Everyone, acting as one.</i>

185
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:34,120
<i>They approach the day of the show
with this pure-white thought.</i>

186
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:37,923
<i>Mukai, who had
been struggling for a moment,</i>

187
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,092
<i>has now found his place, too.</i>

188
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:46,031
-Not me, I like being clean.
-No way.

189
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,867
<i>He's with Fukazawa.</i>

190
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,536
Seriously, no!

191
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:54,306
<i>His cheery nature has been fully revived!</i>

192
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,509
Stop it!

193
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:00,780
I'm not sure about this guy, you know.

194
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,049
Come on! Why not?

195
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,552
There's no going back now!

196
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,388
You can't go back now!

197
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:16,395
I want to find the personalities
I click with out of the nine,

198
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:18,931
and just want to be loved by all of them.

199
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:22,101
So, there's nothing for it
but to do my best.

200
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:23,402
Just do my best.

201
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:26,539
I'd like to use a word other than "best".

202
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:31,544
I guess I'm saying
I want to give more than my best.

203
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:35,648
<i>Meanwhile, another new member...</i>

204
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,586
{\an8}That's it. Okay! Good.

205
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:42,421
{\an8}<i>...is in a Tokyo studio.</i>

206
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:46,792
{\an8}JOHNNY'S JR. UNIT
UCHU SIX

207
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:48,327
{\an8}Listen to that breath!

208
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:54,934
{\an8}<i>As Meguro is splitting his time
with another unit, Uchu Six,</i>

209
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:59,538
{\an8}<i>he's hardly been able to attend any</i>
Takizawa Kabuki ZERO <i>training sessions.</i>

210
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,978
{\an8}<i>As all this is going on,
what preys on Meguro's mind</i>

211
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,148
{\an8}<i>is how the fans
of each of his groups feel.</i>

212
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:14,687
It's the same situation for our fans

213
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:17,690
and for the fans of the original
six Snow Man members.

214
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:23,495
Putting their minds at ease
is a sort of goal for me.

215
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:26,966
I hope I can give them a show

216
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,136
that will get that feeling across
to all of the fans.

217
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,038
I want to overcome that.

218
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,241
If I'm open and bold about it,

219
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:41,480
maybe the fans will also be open
to naturally accepting the situation.

220
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:45,017
So I'm looking forward to
the first performance.

221
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:46,552
I'll give it my all.

222
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:50,556
<i>It's a firm resolution.</i>

223
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,960
-Good morning.
-Good morning!

224
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:57,997
<i>Back to training for the first time
in four days,</i>

225
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,032
<i>Meguro shows he means what he says.</i>

226
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:02,468
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

227
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:06,405
We'll go over the moves
as we do our usual practice.

228
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:07,773
Right, thank you.

229
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:14,013
<i>This is the opening routine,
which he's never practiced before.</i>

230
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:27,226
<i>Meguro doesn't fall a step behind
his band mates.</i>

231
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:36,001
<i>He's memorized the moves just by studying
a video that was sent to him.</i>

232
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,912
I went on tour with ARASHI to Osaka.

233
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:53,319
I got back at around 11:30 last night,

234
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,622
and I heard we were doing this today,

235
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,659
so I asked for a video of the routine.

236
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:05,831
I practiced it right until morning
before I came in today.

237
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,968
What time was it?

238
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:11,570
Maybe about 5:00 in the morning.

239
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:18,077
It was only a video,
but I wanted to test myself

240
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,980
to see how much I could learn.
Or something like that.

241
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,382
It's fun, though.

242
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:25,584
-Really?
-Yes, I think so.

243
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:28,687
Thank you.

244
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:34,560
<i>And this gutsy, determined man
has been assigned an important part.</i>

245
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:41,800
<i>This job involves the taiko drums.</i>

246
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,673
It starts at Taiko A, with Watanabe.

247
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,376
<i>The arrangement of the drummers reveals</i>

248
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:54,346
<i>that in the middle of the circle</i>

249
00:16:54,446 --> 00:17:00,285
<i>Meguro, Mukai and original member Sakuma
will be drumming.</i>

250
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,157
<i>This team truly symbolizes
the new Snow Man.</i>

251
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:12,598
<i>If these three can't work well together,</i>

252
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:14,433
<i>it will all have been for nothing.</i>

253
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:16,568
<i>It's a serious responsibility.</i>

254
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,206
So it's "bang, bang-bang" twice?

255
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,575
It's three times.

256
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:35,020
<i>Can the trio accomplish this huge task?</i>

257
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:39,825
This is tearing my abs up.

258
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:44,163
This is going to be rough.

259
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,599
I'm going to burst a blood vessel
in my face.

260
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:52,671
{\an8}<i>It was December last year.</i>

261
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:58,143
{\an8}Sensei. I do not knoweth
how to tie my belt.

262
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,778
{\an8}DAISUKE SAKUMA (AGE 26)

263
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:02,881
{\an8}<i>Sakuma, who's been given
the important taiko job, is here...</i>

264
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:08,020
{\an8}<i>along with qualified meteorologist Abe,</i>

265
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:11,523
{\an8}<i>as they work on another vital part
of the show.</i>

266
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,196
You get better at playing women
the more you do it.

267
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:22,434
<i>Yes, played by Takizawa
as the focal point of the production,</i>

268
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:24,203
<i>it's the female role.</i>

269
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,639
What was your first impression
about playing a woman?

270
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:29,708
-"Huh?" or something?
-Yes, "Huh?"

271
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:32,344
-Someone has to do it, though.
-Yes.

272
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:34,646
When I heard we were doing
<i>Takizawa Kabuki</i>,

273
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:41,987
I wondered who would be taking
which parts from Takizawa.

274
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:47,359
But I never thought I'd end up doing this!

275
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:52,331
<i>They're learning from the beginning.</i>

276
00:18:56,201 --> 00:19:00,005
One. Two. Three.

277
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:01,740
Yes, that's it.

278
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:04,276
The lower your shoulders,
the prettier you look.

279
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:10,749
<i>Sakuma is athletic, the kind to master
whatever he sets his mind to quickly.</i>

280
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:15,420
<i>But Abe has no confidence at all
when it comes to these things,</i>

281
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:17,890
<i>meaning he achieves things
through hard work.</i>

282
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:22,294
I'm so tense!

283
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:25,697
Yes, you need to relax more.
Relax your muscles as much as possible.

284
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:27,766
It makes your muscles ache, doesn't it?

285
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:33,772
<i>Abe found the worth of living life
as an idol</i>

286
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:35,541
<i>nine years ago.</i>

287
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,843
<i>He was in his second year of high school.</i>

288
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:48,320
<i>It was when he had his first line
in</i> Takizawa Kabuki.

289
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:54,626
EVEN YOU WERE ONCE A POOR FARMER

290
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:58,530
<i>It may have only been
this short line, but...</i>

291
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:03,068
My role was Farmer 8.

292
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:06,605
But I put so much effort

293
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:08,907
into delivering that one line.

294
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:12,411
I took it and ran with it,

295
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:15,514
and the next year I was the village head.

296
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:20,018
<i>Nobody can beat hard work.</i>

297
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:23,822
<i>This job taught him that lesson.</i>

298
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:30,596
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you very much.

299
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:38,637
{\an8}<i>A student up until spring last year,
Abe studied at the postgraduate level,</i>

300
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:40,839
{\an8}<i>and it was also for the sake
of this career</i>

301
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,208
{\an8}<i>that he got
his meteorologist qualification.</i>

302
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:50,382
{\an8}<i>He needed to take time off being an idol
to take his university entrance exams,</i>

303
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:53,819
{\an8}<i>and though his band mates were against it,
Abe pushed ahead</i>

304
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:56,855
<i>and joined a science faculty
to study difficult subjects.</i>

305
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:03,862
One of the reasons I went on

306
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:10,602
to study information science
at graduate school

307
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:17,676
was because I was thinking about
a performance that uses programming.

308
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:25,050
So, if Snow Man were to do
something futuristic in the years to come,

309
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:27,919
with even a little bit
of knowledge about that

310
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:32,157
I could offer some suggestions.
That was my thinking.

311
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:36,762
Because I had been in that field.

312
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:43,402
I'm sure that what I learned will be
useful at some point in the future.

313
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:47,205
It's the Johnny's way of thinking.

314
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:51,243
Not wanting to do
what everyone else is doing.

315
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:55,614
I wanted to acquire a specialized skill.

316
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:59,051
It was that desire that spurred me on.

317
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:06,391
<i>That desire remains unchanged.</i>

318
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:14,933
<i>And now that vital part of the program,
the taiko.</i>

319
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:20,105
<i>Nobody can get the hang of the rhythms,
and all are concerned.</i>

320
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:28,780
<i>The members start to learn it
in an unusual way.</i>

321
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:34,386
Pork ribs, pork ribs, pork ribs,
pork ribs, pork ribs.

322
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:36,555
Bang, bang, peanuts. Bang, bang, peanuts.

323
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,457
Sherbet, sherbet, bang.

324
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:42,294
<i>What on earth are they doing?</i>

325
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:46,965
Bang, bang, peanuts.
Bang, bang, croquette.

326
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:50,969
What are the peanuts and croquette?

327
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,238
It's our way of remembering it.

328
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:55,440
It makes it stick.

329
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:58,577
Abe-chan put some lyrics to the music.

330
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:02,147
And then it really sinks in.

331
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:06,351
But you sometimes say it out loud
during the real thing. Peanuts.

332
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:07,586
You can't do that.

333
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:13,825
<i>So, Abe really is an indispensable
part of Snow Man.</i>

334
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:20,732
{\an8}<i>On the next</i> Ride On Time<i>,</i>

335
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,804
{\an8}<i>training reaches its final stages
and a mega apparatus shows up.</i>

336
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,040
{\an8}Takizawa-kun!

337
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,244
{\an8}<i>The band members' tempers flare.</i>

338
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:35,447
{\an8}You fix it. Quickly!

339
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:37,916
{\an8}It's your fault
if the person on the top gets hurt.

340
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,888
{\an8}If you're not constantly giving more
than 100 percent onstage,

341
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:46,091
{\an8}I don't think you can stir
people's emotions.

342
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:49,594
{\an8}<i>Questions will be asked
of their resolve and attitude.</i>

343
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:55,066
{\an8}Isn't it there to get to the next number?
You start at zero, then get higher.

344
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:59,838
{\an8}<i>And they head for Kyoto,
the scene of battle.</i>
