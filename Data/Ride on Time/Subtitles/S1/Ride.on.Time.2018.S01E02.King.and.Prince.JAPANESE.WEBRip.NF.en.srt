61
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,000
Doing a funny face means nothing to me.

62
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:57,503
When distorting your face,
you go from one to one hundred.

63
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:01,374
Once you go to a hundred,
you can always subtract from there.

64
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:03,576
I feel like you don't know very much

65
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:06,879

I didn't go to a regular school.
It was a correspondence school.

75

So I didn't really have
a typical experience as a youth.

76

83
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:17,116
I thought I'd take a chance
instead of getting a regular job.

84
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,785
I took a gamble.

<i>That was when he was thirteen,

-Yes.

88
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,869
It still makes me nervous
when I come here.

89
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,673
Right here in this room,

90
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,176
there were so many people.

91
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:45,144
Where was I, again?

92
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:50,350
I think I was somewhere around here.

93
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:54,520
McDonald's... We were served McDonald's.

94
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:58,858
I think Mr. Johnny orders it each time,

95
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,895
but to me, McDonald's
never tasted so special.

96

<i>Sato joined one year later than Kishi,</i>

101
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:31,090

<i>Being a backup dancer

00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:44,404
I was a complete mess.

105
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:46,439
I really was.

106
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:50,009
I lost my motivation to work.

107
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:54,080
I couldn't understand why
I had to do certain things.

108
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:58,251
Personally, I thought that
I slowly made my way up to the point

109
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:00,186

110
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,590
But the moment he joined,
he rose up so quickly

111
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:07,059
and surpassed me and others.

112
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,429
I was speechless.

113
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:15,301
Debuting seemed
unrealistic to me at times.

114
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,538
I used to think that way back then.

I don't want others to feel excluded,

127
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,261
so I was planning to keep
my distance from him.

128
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,531
I guess people in Johnny's

When different Johnny's

<i>He mentioned it

You said you don't cry, right?

00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:42,522
I never really cry.

137
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:44,857
It takes a lot to make me cry.

138
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:47,493
I only cry when I yawn.

139
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,596
I was watching a movie with my friends

140
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:53,933
and I asked them if they cried afterward.

141
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,903
They said yes and asked me if I did,
and I said no.

142
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:58,471
They told me, "you're not human."

143
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:00,406
I'm told that pretty often.

144
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:05,745
<i>His inability to cry</i>

145
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:09,615

moving because of work.</i>

<i>Every time he made new friends,

148
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:26,332
<i>After a while,
he began to build up emotional walls.</i>

149
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:28,801
I'm naturally very shy.

150
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,872
Because of my family's work situation,

151
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:34,907
I've moved to so many places.

152
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:40,279
About five or six cities.

153
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:43,316
Because I transferred schools
so many times

154
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,920
and had to make new friends each time,
I became very shy.

155
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:51,390
As a kid, I didn't talk at all.

156
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:53,159
I was naturally a gloomy kid.

157
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,498
But Johnny's helped in changing
my personality.

158
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:04,070
<i>He joined Johnny & Associates, Inc. when
he was in his first year of junior high.</i>

159

<i>There, he found peers

160
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:11,911
<i>Along with his peers,
he immersed himself in the lessons</i>

161
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:14,947
<i>and in time,
his trials turned into his strengths.</i>

162
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:19,919
Saying that I was reborn
may be an exaggeration,

163
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:22,655
but that's how much I've changed.

164
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:25,891
I enjoy hanging out with people,

165
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,794
eating out with people,
and talking to people.

166
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:33,699
That is how
I improved my communication skills.

167
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:37,737
I changed a lot.

168
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:41,273
<i>More than anything else,</i>

169
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:45,845
<i>he is grateful that he has friends
he can walk shoulder to shoulder with.</i>

170
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:51,917
<i>One of those friends is Jinguji.</i>

171
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,421
<i>He was on his way
to shoot a difficult scene.</i>

172
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:03,529
<i>He says it's a critical scene
at the climax of the film.</i>

173
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,166

174
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:10,469
Okay. Let's take that again.

175

<i>It's a long take that lasts
for ten minutes.</i>

176

but it was fun at the same time.

194
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,409
It's fun. I'll go enjoy myself.

<i>The reason why Jinguji can persevere</i>

196
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,983
<i>is because his bitter experiences
make him stronger.</i>

197
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:41,026
<i>Jinguji has always admired idols

209

{\an8}<i>leaving them feeling
frustrated and jealous.</i>

210
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:29,375
That was really shocking for me.
I was 18 at the time.

211
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:33,445
That was the toughest time of my life.

212
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,581
When we didn't get offers.

213
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:38,117
I was in my third year of high school,

214
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,520
and I had to think about college.

215
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:44,390
If I'm not going to get any work...

216
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:48,360
If there's no work coming in
even though I'm willing,

217
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,964
I thought for a second,
that maybe I should quit.

218
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:56,268
I feel like I became...

219
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:00,940
one step closer to being an adult

220
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:05,244
from going through all those emotions
during that time.

221
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:08,714
But because we went through all of that,

222
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:13,352
because we hit rock bottom,

223
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:17,223
we realized that nothing could
bring us down any further.

224
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:18,657
There's nothing to fear,

225
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:22,361
so we decided to do all that we can
from now on.

-Lower is better.

I'd be portrayed as the guy
who gave up at 119.

344
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:20,879
That's unacceptable.

345
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,814
I don't want to settle.

346
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:26,518
Once you settle, that's the end.

347
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:30,422
That goes for King & Prince too.

348
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:36,295
<i>His motivation to work hard
also comes from an inner struggle.</i>

349
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:39,931
<i>Suddenly, he begins to talk about
his complicated feelings</i>

350
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:42,334
<i>toward the other members.</i>

351
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:46,638
Because there are
six of us in King & Prince,

352
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:49,574
I feel like it's important
to keep a good balance.

353
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:56,715
So many of the members are working hard
in different fields.

354
00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:59,451
Right now, it's not my time to shine,

355
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:03,088
but I think that supporting those members

356
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:07,125
and helping them shine even brighter

357
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:12,364
is my duty as a fellow member
and my personal role.

358
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,667
No matter what people might say,

359
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,704
even if they call me a loser,

360
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:22,140
I want to follow the path
that I believe in.

361
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:25,510
And as I'm saying this,
we're still inside the shop.

362
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:33,418
<i>"Right now, it's not my time to shine.</i>

363
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:36,188
<i>It's time to make
the other members shine."</i>

364
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:40,659
<i>As someone who gained tremendous
popularity as a Johnny's Jr. member,</i>

365
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,894
<i>Iwahashi seems to be suppressing something</i>

366
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:45,197
<i>deep inside of him.</i>

367
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:52,270
<i>Next time,
that something begins to surface.</i>

368
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:02,681
Listen to what I'm saying.

369
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,451
<i>What happened to Iwahashi?</i>

370
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:07,853
Can't you see?

371
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:11,323
{\an8}<i>On the next</i> Ride On Time<i>...</i>

372
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:14,092
Cut it out.

373
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:18,797
<i>We see the members clash
for the first time.</i>

374
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:24,870
{\an8}If you can't take it seriously, just quit.

375
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:28,240
{\an8}It may be destiny.

376
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:31,376
{\an8}<i>A brief moment of relaxation.</i>

377
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:41,219
{\an8}<i>Their big performance
is now just around the corner.</i>

378
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:46,024
{\an8}<i>Can the six of them restore their bond?</i>

379
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:49,461
{\an8}There are so many noises reverberating.

380
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:51,263
{\an8}I'm completely fine.

381
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:53,665
I suddenly became so hungry.

382
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:56,735
Bye.

383
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:00,806
