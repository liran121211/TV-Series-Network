3
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:13,013
I'm tired.

4
00:00:13,646 --> 00:00:14,647
I'm tired.

5
00:00:15,915 --> 00:00:18,852
We saw you.

6
00:00:19,652 --> 00:00:21,688
{\an8}This year was really...

{\an8}SHO HIRANO (AGE 22)

8
00:00:22,922 --> 00:00:25,959
{\an8}...a year where everything changed.

9

<i>This is documentary series</i> Ride On Time.

10
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:54,154
{\an8}Wow!

{\an8}JANUARY 17TH, 2018 CD DEBUT ANNOUNCEMENT

12
00:00:56,122 --> 00:01:00,660
{\an8}<i>King & Prince's debut was announced
in January of 2018.</i>

13
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:04,431
"You guys are debuting."

14
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:07,801
I thought it was a myth,
but it actually happened.

15
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:12,238
<i>That marked the beginning
of a year of activity.</i>

16
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:16,910
We'll take Sho and Genki.

17
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:17,811
Go!

18
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:22,215
<i>They keep aiming for the top,
while searching for their originality.</i>

19
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:26,252
I can't do such a typical idol pose.

20
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,889
I'm really not cut out to be an idol.

21
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:32,392
You have to say things
that'll make their hearts throb.

22
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:33,693
I really can't do that.

23
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,497
{\an8}<i>But they were determined...</i>

{\an8}YUTA KISHI (AGE 23)

00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,766
{\an8}<i>...to do anything.</i>

26
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,370
{\an8}If it's for this role, I will do anything.

27
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:45,472
{\an8}That's how determined I am.

28
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:48,074
Doing a funny face means nothing to me.

29
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:50,510
{\an8}Cut. One more time.

30
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:51,911
{\an8}YUTA JINGUJI (AGE 21)

{\an8}GENKI IWAHASHI (AGE 22)

33
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:09,295
{\an8}<i>Each of them searched for what
they could bring to the table.</i>

34

{\an8}KAITO TAKAHASHI (AGE 19)

35
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:16,136
My brain isn't functioning.

36
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:22,408
{\an8}<i>However, they were encouraged by
the people who support them.</i>

39
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,814
{\an8}Delicious.

40
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:35,288
<i>In what ways did they mature
during this year?</i>

41
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:38,358
<i>At the end and beginning of a year,</i>

42
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:43,696

45
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:03,917
<i>Outside of the theater,
fans were creating a long line.</i>

46
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:14,360
<i>The show called Johnnys' Island,
which has been held every year,</i>

47

<i>A total of more than
70 Johnny's Jr. members perform</i>

<i>in this approximately
two-month-long show.</i>

51
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:39,786
<i>There is singing.</i>

52
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:45,525
<i>There is dancing.</i>

53
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:51,197
<i>The youths mature into entertainers.</i>

54
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,966
<i>This is a stepping stone</i>

55
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:56,469
<i>that their countless
predecessors have treasured.</i>

56
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:04,711
<i>This time, the group to take
center stage is King & Prince.</i>

57
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:10,617
<i>We filmed them just two months ago.</i>

58
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:13,386
<i>The members have become so dependable.</i>

59
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:21,294
<i>One of them in particular has gained
a lot of experience,</i>

60
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:25,265
<i>through starring in several
drama series and movies. Sho Hirano.</i>

61
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:34,540
<i>Throughout this year,
Hirano has been moving at top speed.</i>

62
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:37,610
<i>It's no surprise he looks tired.</i>

63
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,814
I am pretty busy. It's hectic.

64
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:44,284
This year was really

65
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:49,555
a productive year. That's the only word
that can describe it.

66
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:52,592
{\an8}Ready...

00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:53,860
{\an8}JULY 2018 COMMERCIAL FILMING

68
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:55,628
{\an8}<i>Even when his schedule is packed,</i>

69
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:59,332
{\an8}<i>Hirano's genuine personality shows
through his innocent smile.</i>

70
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:03,369
<i>He would also say things
you wouldn't expect from an idol.</i>

71
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,675
Look at how I walk.
I look like an old man.

72
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:14,347
An idol shouldn't be
walking like this, actually.

73
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:18,017
I should be walking like this.

74
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:23,289
<i>Hirano decided to become an idol
in elementary school.</i>

75
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,327
<i>He was able to work hard
because he wanted to help his mother.</i>

76
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:30,997
I was raised by a single mother.

77
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:32,832
My mother almost died once.

78
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:38,204
I didn't want to make my mother sad,

79
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:42,375
so I felt like I had to
work hard at my job.

80
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:46,245
{\an8}There's nothing here.

81
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:50,683
{\an8}<i>What left an impression was
what he said in his hometown of Nagoya.</i>

82
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,385
{\an8}SEPTEMBER 2018 NAGOYA

83
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,355
Was there anything you wanted to be
other than an idol?

84
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:57,357
So many things.

85
00:05:57,657 --> 00:06:01,694
I like protecting people.

86
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:07,500
I wanted to go to
disaster areas and help out,

87
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:12,271
but I was told that...

88
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,943
even if I can't physically help them

89
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:18,911
by removing debris and whatnot,

90
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:25,318
people who see us on TV,
or in magazines, or at concerts

91
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:30,056
can be emotionally uplifted
and motivated to live another day.

92
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:35,261
That's why, at the end of concerts,
I often say, "Don't die."

93
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:38,798
Even if we couldn't make eye contact
at the concert,

94
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:42,168
I want everyone who is watching me
and who is connected with me

95
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,805
to stay alive. I really do.

96
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:49,809
The reason I'm continuing this job,
is because I want to

97
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:54,714
lift everyone's spirits.

98
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:58,518
All right.

99
00:06:58,584 --> 00:06:59,952
<i>How did Hirano deal with</i>

100
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,556
<i>the massive pressure that weighed down</i>

101
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,324
<i>on him this past year?</i>

102
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:07,994
One, two, one, two.

103
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,896
<i>His answer was unique.</i>

104
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:11,631
Let's go!

105
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:17,937
Pressure... I didn't really feel it.

106
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,740
I guess I should have felt the pressure.

107
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:22,341
The agency would want me to.

108
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,179
Before a big performance,
they would tell me,

109
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:28,714
"We're counting on you!" pretty often.

110
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:31,951
Even during the shows,
they're constantly telling me,

111
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,786
"Please make it work"

112
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:36,589
and "We're counting on you to do this."

113
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:38,724
I get that a lot.

114
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:42,829
But I don't want to let those words

115
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:45,565
get me nervous.

116
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:50,503
I brush it off. I dodge their words.

117
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:53,806
I make sure that I'm putting in

118
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:57,977
one hundred percent, though.

119
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:09,422
<i>In the show,
the one who played a fighting soldier</i>

120
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:14,660
{\an8}<i>was Yuta Jinguji.</i>

121
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:20,800
{\an8}<i>For him, this year was
a crucial turning point in his life.</i>

{\an8}<i>Jinguji opened up about
his deepest thoughts</i>

124
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,248
{\an8}<i>when we visited a certain temple.</i>

125
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:41,487
That was really shocking for me.
I was 18 at the time.

126
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:46,025
That was the toughest time of my life.

127
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:47,960
When we didn't get offers.

128
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:52,598
If there's no work coming in
even though I'm willing,

129
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:56,202
I thought for a second,
that maybe I should quit.

{\an8}<i>but from the following year,</i>

133
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:10,049
{\an8}<i>they broke up into two units of three.</i>

134

{\an8}<i>However, the unit Jinguji was in</i>

136

140
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:34,240
{\an8}<i>That is why, when it was decided that
the six of them were going to debut,</i>

141
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,476
<i>he swore to do anything it took.</i>

142
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:41,314
Cut.

143
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:47,053
<i>When he was filming a movie,</i>

144
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:51,290
<i>he was repeatedly told to retake
one scene for over two hours.</i>

145
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:58,130
<i>What has supported Jinguji
during this past year?</i>

146
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:01,567
Since we were the ones who told

147
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:06,072
Mr. Johnny that we wanted to debut,

148
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,774
of course I felt
the responsibility and pressure.

149
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:10,309
What if...

150
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:13,579
What if our CDs don't sell?

151
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:17,116
What if we don't live up
to their expectations?

152
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:19,619
I did worry about that.

153
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,188
Mr. Johnny created us,

154
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:27,693
so I felt the pressure
of not wanting to put him to shame.

155
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:31,197
But now, those thoughts don't even

156
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:34,767
cross my mind anymore, because our fans

157
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:37,937
are so supportive of us.

158
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:41,607
Now, all I can think about
is how I can give back.

159
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:43,609
I want to give back to them.

160
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:51,817
<i>Supporting the group

161
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:57,857
{\an8}<i>were the two youngest members,

162
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,127
{\an8}<i>and Kaito Takahashi.</i>

163

<i>where he spent

167
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,314
{\an8}This is also where I joined Johnny's,

168
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:27,319

00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:32,591
My personality
was shaped here in Osaka as well.

170
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:37,496
There he is.

171
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:39,098
{\an8}Long time no see.

172
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,366
{\an8}There he is.

173
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:44,970
{\an8}<i>He met up with his homeroom teacher
from middle school, Mr. Ukon.</i>

174
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:50,076
<i>When Nagase was unsure about his future,</i>

175
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:52,511
<i>he was there to give encouragement.</i>

176
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,549
He was worrying about it
more than anyone else.

177
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:59,351
You wanted to either study
or work in the entertainment industry.

178
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:02,154
Because my grades were pretty good.

179
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:04,223
That's right. You weren't sure.

180
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,558
I thought it would be a waste.

181
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,093
I thought that if I chose

182
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:11,964
while I was young,
I'd still have time to start over again.

183
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:13,933
You've grown up so much.

184
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:14,867
It's the fans.

185
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:17,970
Seriously, it's all thanks to them.

186
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:19,138
I mean...

187
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:24,143
When the fans cheer for us
during our concerts,

188
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,812
-it honestly feels really great.
-I see.

189
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,781
It feels better than you'd imagine.

190
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:31,350
You came so close, remember?

191
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,687
And during your performance,
you waved at me.

192
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,690
When I called out your name,
you waved at me.

193
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,626
Then the fans around me
started screaming,

194
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,863
but inside, I was thinking,
"No, he's waving at me!"

195
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:52,438
<i>There are people who are
watching over him from afar.</i>

196
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:57,877
{\an8}<i>Meanwhile, in a previous interview,</i>

197
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,812
{\an8}<i>Takahashi had said this...</i>

198
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:03,182
I just don't have a lot of
self-confidence.

199
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:04,283
That's how I am.

200
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,519
It was decided in January.

201
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:09,889
I was worried if I could
handle all the pressure.

202
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,191
Tears just began to stream down.

203
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,094
{\an8}Long time no see.

204
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:18,364
{\an8}<i>One person who gave Takahashi courage</i>

205
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:22,401
{\an8}<i>was his high school teacher, Mr. Nakao.</i>

206
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,569
{\an8}TEACHER TADASHI NAKAO

207
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:26,138
He always knew when I was tired.

208
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:28,974
He could tell if I was up late at night.

209
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:32,845
Every day, I would talk to him
about my work,

210
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:35,481
as if I was reporting to him.

211
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:39,552
That's right. You did that a lot.
You would tell me your plans for the day.

212
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:41,187
And what I did that day.

213
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:47,960
<i>What made Takahashi the happiest
was a gift from his teacher.</i>

214
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:51,230
Wow!

215
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:52,531
{\an8}LAUGHTER, APPRECIATION

216
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:54,266
{\an8}I'm so happy.

217
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,734
Oh, wow!

218
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:57,937
One second.

219
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:03,075
When I went to your place,
you gave me one.

220
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:07,713
I brought it. Now I have a complete set.

221
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,014
{\an8}HARD WORK PAYS OFF
KAITO TAKAHASHI

222
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:12,451
{\an8}They have a magical power.
It makes me realize that

223
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,053
{\an8}it's important for me
to always be smiling.

224
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:15,321
That's what an idol is to me.

225
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:22,161
<i>With those words ingrained in his heart,
how did he survive this past year?</i>

226
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:27,700
Days off? Ever since I started
performing at the theater

227
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:32,037
I haven't had a single day off.
Yeah, not a single day.

228
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:37,209
But I feel like I can be myself
when I'm working

229
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,645
more than when I'm not.

230
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:43,315
I want to spend more time
with the other members.

231
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:48,053
I want to talk more with the staff too.

232
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:52,858
<i>Time has turned the young boy
who was constantly crying</i>

233
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:54,827
<i>into someone so dependable.</i>

234
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:00,499
<i>Nagase, on the other hand...</i>

235
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:05,271
It went by so fast.

236
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:08,374
It felt like seconds.

237
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:13,145
I made so many memories, of course.

238
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:18,317
I made so many memories,
I can't choose the best one.

239
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,551
So, it was productive.

240
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:22,221
But time flies when
you're having fun, you know?

241
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:24,723
That's why this year felt so short.

242
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,459
I wanted the year
to pass by quickly, though.

243
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:28,827
-Really?
-Yes.

244
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:31,230
Why?

245
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:33,032
Because I'm 19.

246
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:36,936
I'll be able to do a lot more
when I turn 20.

247
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:39,872
That's my only reason.
It's super personal.

248
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:45,911
{\an8}DECEMBER 31ST, 2018 TOKYO DOME
JOHNNY'S COUNTDOWN REHEARSAL

249
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:49,348
{\an8}<i>December 31st is finally here.</i>

250
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:53,552
We'll be in your care.

251
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:54,987
<i>This day's schedule</i>

252
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:57,856
<i>begins with the rehearsal
for the countdown concert</i>

253
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:00,426
<i>which they'll perform with their seniors.</i>

254
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:06,732
<i>After that, they will perform
at NHK's Kohaku Uta Gassen.</i>

255
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:10,035
<i>They will then return to Tokyo Dome</i>

256
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:12,905
<i>for the New Year's live broadcast.</i>

257
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:21,513
<i>On this celebratory day,
there was a man with a serious face.</i>

258
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:24,216
{\an8}<i>Yuta Kishi.</i>

259
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:29,321
{\an8}<i>As they keep rising in popularity,</i>

260
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:33,993
{\an8}<i>he was calmly reflecting on the past year
and their future with him as the leader.</i>

261
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:40,366
We experienced so many things
for the first time.

262
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:41,900
We had new experiences

263
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:44,937
and worked with people
who we never worked with before.

264
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,173
Everything was new to us.

265
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,109
Of course, trying new things

266
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,678
sometimes led to discouragement.

267
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:56,715
And... I would learn new things

268
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:59,718
and become downhearted.

269
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:01,420
Everyone feels...

270
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:04,990
downhearted at times, you know?

271
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:07,726
Like when I'm invited on a show,

272
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:10,996
but I fail to make everyone laugh.
That happens very often.

273
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:15,968
I feel under pressure
for any job, honestly.

274
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:19,605
But I feel like this is
to be expected now that

275
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:21,874
we've debuted.

276
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,376
Having a busy schedule

277
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:27,579
is something we are grateful for.
It's an honor

278
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:29,782
to be able to work as a group.

279
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:32,017
But you know...

280
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,121
we can't expect it
to be like this forever.

281
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:40,626
What we need to do at the moment
is to give everything our best.

282
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:43,462
We just have to try our best

283
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:46,365
to deliver what is expected of us.

284
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:48,033
Yeah...

285
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:55,507
As a group, I hope we can become
the type of people

286
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:59,678
who can go above and beyond
people's expectations.

287
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:02,381
{\an8}DECEMBER 31ST, 2018
BEFORE THE PERFORMANCE

288
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:08,220
{\an8}<i>It was finally time to perform
on the stage of their dreams, Kohaku.</i>

289
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:12,124
We're excited, but nervous
at the same time.

290
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:14,626
-Let's go.
-Here we go.

291
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:16,495
I'll do my best in the Kid's Corner.

292
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:19,498
Focus on "Cinderella Girl."

297
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:38,884
{\an8}<i>Another stage King & Prince has dreamed
of performing on,</i>

298
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:42,054
{\an8}<i>the Countdown Concert was about to begin.</i>

299
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,356
{\an8}We have five seconds.

300
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:45,691
{\an8}Here they are!

301
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:47,893
{\an8}-Hello.
-They're here.

302
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,429
{\an8}Are you King or Prince?

303
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:54,867
<i>Here are some behind-the-scenes footage
from before the live broadcast.</i>

304
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:56,768
You're not Tetsu and Tomo?

305
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:58,537
No, we're not.

306
00:18:58,604 --> 00:18:59,638
You got the "and" part.

307
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:00,606
Oh, really?

308
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:01,740
Do your best!

309
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,842
-Yes!
-Remember, you're the opening act.

310
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:04,943
Yes!

311
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:06,545
Form a huddle.

312
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:08,480
-Yes!
-You should.

313
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:12,317
King & Prince!

314
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:15,053
When's our cue?

315
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,655
-Sorry.
-Give us a cue.

316
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:19,725
King & Prince!

{\an8}LIVE BROADCAST BEGINS

318
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,862
{\an8}<i>The live New Year's broadcast
has finally begun.</i>

319
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:50,055
<i>Until last year,
performing here was just a dream.</i>

320
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:54,326
<i>This year, they're singing
as the opening act.</i>

321
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:05,137
<i>At this moment, the five of them</i>

322
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,607
<i>were determined to perform for their fans
on behalf of one member</i>

323
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:10,275
<i>who couldn't be there.</i>

324
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:23,922
{\an8}<i>That determination was apparent</i>

325
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:27,292
{\an8}<i>when we asked Takahashi
about the group's future.</i>

326
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:32,364
We are who we are,
when the six of us are together.

327
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,802
<i>Six people make up King & Prince.</i>

328
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:44,409
{\an8}<i>The member who was the most committed
to being an idol.</i>

329
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:48,947
{\an8}<i>At the moment,
he is getting treatment for his illness.</i>

330
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:56,054
There's no more beef tongue chili paste.

331
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,025
<i>Despite his illness, he has been</i>

332
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,128
<i>supporting the group
with a smile on his face</i>

333
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:06,098
<i>from before their debut
to their first concert tour.</i>

334
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:09,301
You can have the oil.

335
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:10,702
I'll do it.

336
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:12,070
Not the chili.

337
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:13,939
-Why not?
-Not the chili.

338
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:14,873
All right.

339
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:19,645
<i>Iwahashi had one wish...</i>

340
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:23,315
I hope we can all stay friends.

341
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:28,920
That will always show in our performances.

342
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:32,858
I hope we always stay aware of the fact

343
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,828
that we represent King & Prince,

344
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:39,698
and never forget to show
appreciation and respect.

345
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,501
I hope that we can

346
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:47,839
keep on living like that from now on too.

347
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:49,941
If we do that,

348
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:53,845
we will always know what we need.

350
00:21:57,382 --> 00:22:00,752
{\an8}<i>Thinking of Iwahashi,
on the stage of Kohaku,</i>

351
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:04,356
{\an8}<i>they had a spotlight shine
where he would've stood</i>

352

{\an8}<i>and sang as the sixth man.</i>

353
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,428

-Really?
-Yeah.

He said, "Thank you for including me."

356
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:14,032
About the spotlight.

357
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:18,236
He sent a photo and said
he was on stage with us.

358
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:21,473
-So he was watching it live?
-Yes.

370
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:05,217
{\an8}It died.

371
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:08,787
