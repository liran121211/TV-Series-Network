1
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:07,040
{\an8}<i>The pop idol group SixTONES.</i>

2
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:15,015
{\an8}<i>They started a concert tour this January
to push their second album.</i>

3
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:18,685
I remember this.

4
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:20,120
ONE MONTH EARLIER

5
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:24,557
<i>The group has different
personalities and preferences,</i>

6
00:00:24,624 --> 00:00:28,428
<i>but they come together when
they put on a concert.</i>

7
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:32,032
I see.

8
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:32,932
Seems doable.

9
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:34,834
Let's give it a try.

10
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:39,906
A cheering crowd
used to be a given, so I hate...

11
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:44,210
not being able to hear them.

12
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:51,084
I want things back to normal so we can
do simple interactions with the crowd.

13
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:54,687
{\an8}<i>They spent over 10 years in Johnny's Jr.</i>

14
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:59,526
{\an8}<i>before they were able to achieve
their CD debut.</i>

15
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:03,063
<i>They nearly lost heart many times.</i>

16
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:08,301
<i>The one thing that kept them going
was their audience's cheers.</i>

17
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:20,113
Back during that time,

18
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:26,319
there was this invisible persuasiveness
that was our main drive.

19
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:28,688
And passion.

20
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:33,359
There was an emphasis on
that which can't be quantified.

21
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:37,030
<i>The heart they put into the shows.</i>

22
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:44,003
<i>It was one of the fundamental blocks
of their formation as a group.</i>

23
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:08,595
<i>This is documentary series</i> RIDE ON TIME.

24
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:15,902
{\an8}<i>Where is your origin?</i>

25
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:20,673
This is me.

26
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,977
It was definitely here.

27
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:25,578
The atmosphere is similar.

28
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:28,681
It's like what Frieza rode
in his first form.

29
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:36,322
{\an8}<i>Taiga Kyomoto visited an area
where he lived during childhood.</i>

30
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:40,793
I played with Yamada from Hey! Say! JUMP

31
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:43,763
in this sandbox as a kid.

32
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,432
-Yeah.
-Are you kidding me?

33
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:49,502
I have a lot of surprising stories.

34
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:53,640
{\an8}<i>His first encounter with his mentor
in the agency</i>

35
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:55,708
{\an8}<i>was too long ago to remember.</i>

36
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:59,646
{\an8}<i>He's had a strange connection to Johnny's
since then.</i>

37
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:03,249
I was an only child

38
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:07,253
and I probably didn't come here
with my kindergarten friends.

39
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,122
I'd come here alone

40
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:14,427
and kind, calm kids
like Yamada would approach me.

41
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:16,296
And we'd become friends.

42
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:19,966
I wouldn't join in with kids
playing rowdily with balls.

43
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:25,672
<i>Kyomoto may be starring in musicals now,</i>

44
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:30,009
<i>but he wasn't interested in singing
before he joined the agency.</i>

45
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:37,150
Do you sometimes imagine a different
version of yourself?

46
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:40,987
Well, you know,

47
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:46,259
I don't have a sense of adventure at all.

48
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:50,230
If I fall in love with something,
I stick with it forever.

49
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:53,933
I love singing right now.

50
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:58,071
But that's probably only because
I joined Johnny's.

51
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:02,208
Above everything else, Mr. Johnny was...

52
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:10,016
He's the one that led me
to singing and everything else.

53
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,219
Mr. Johnny told me to sing on my own.

54
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:17,257
Mr. Johnny pushed me
to be in musicals too.

55
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:21,427
I'm so grateful to have

56
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:28,468
been taught about this world.

57
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,676
{\an8}<i>Each member's origin.</i>

58
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:39,045
{\an8}SHIMADA, SHIZUOKA

59
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:45,551
{\an8}<i>Hokuto Matsumura visits his hometown,
where he lived up through junior high.</i>

60
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,823
I'm a little nervous.

61
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:54,994
Aki!

62
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:57,897
-Long time no see.
-Yeah.

63
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,602
-It's been three years.
-Has it?

64
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:03,703
Before you left.

65
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:07,974
Long time no see.

66
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,142
-How've you been?
-Good.

67
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,177
That's good. Are you off today?

68
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:14,447
I just went in this morning. Then I left.

69
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:16,316
What should we do?

70
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:20,219
First, I'd love to see
the junior high school.

71
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:25,525
We never were in the same class, were we?

72
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:27,393
-You're right.
-Right?

73
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,063
Weren't you scared of me?
How'd we get close?

74
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:32,932
Right? But I never said
I was scared of you.

75
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:36,536
I just thought you were a noisy guy.

76
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:39,772
Like, there's this noisy guy
making a ruckus.

77
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:44,510
{\an8}<i>He entered Johnny's at age 13.</i>

78
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:50,683
<i>In the beginning, he commuted
to Tokyo from his hometown.</i>

79
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,754
-Hello.
-Thanks for having us.

80
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:59,425
-This was the student entrance.
-Yes, I'd come through here on my bike.

81
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:02,161
-That's right.
-I'd come on my bike.

82
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:05,098
-This brings back memories.
-It does.

83
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:07,633
It looks cleaner.

84
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:15,375
My classroom was over here,
and yours was over there.

85
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:16,843
Right.

86
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:18,144
Our classrooms.

87
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,213
I was over here.

88
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:26,085
We hated being apart, so sometimes
one of us would sit in the other's class.

89
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:29,622
-Then we'd get sent back.
-We'd sit in until we got caught.

90
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:32,258
For some reason on this floor

91
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:37,230
it was popular to sing
and dance to KinKi Kids and KAT-TUN.

92
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:41,701
-You know what I mean?
-Like this.

93
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:44,937
On and on like this.

94
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,906
And we'd check each other out.

95
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,777
-That brings back memories.
-You still remember.

96
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:55,681
One time we got so into it
that we broke the ceiling.

97
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:01,521
-I didn't think I'd make it this far.
-Totally.

98
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,256
Don't agree!

99
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:07,226
You know, from my point of view,

100
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:12,331
I wanted you to work hard and make it.

101
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:16,235
But I couldn't tell you to
work hard and do your best.

102
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:17,370
Yeah?

103
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,540
Because I knew how tough it was for you.

104
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,074
Yeah.

105
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:29,449
<i>Matsumura was selected
to join a promising unit.</i>

106
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:33,886
<i>He took the plunge and moved to Tokyo
after junior high school.</i>

107
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:40,693
<i>However, not long after,
the unit disbanded.</i>

108
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:46,132
{\an8}<i>This forced him and Yugo Kochi,
who would go on to join SixTONES,</i>

109
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:50,069
{\an8}<i>to search for a different path to follow.</i>

110
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,405
-I remember graduation.
-Right?

111
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:59,312
After graduation, we made plans
for me to spend the night at your house.

112
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:00,346
-Right.
-Yeah.

113
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:04,517
So I asked when I should spend the night.

114
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:08,321
When I should go over.

115
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:11,657
Then you said, "Sorry."

116
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:16,596
"We're all leaving for Tokyo today."

117
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:19,198
I wasn't prepared for that emotionally.

118
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:21,767
So I was like, "I see."

119
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:27,073
Yeah, I didn't tell anyone
I was moving to Tokyo.

120
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:32,011
I said I'd work hard at baseball,
so you work hard at being an idol.

121
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:35,615
We said we'd hang out together.

122
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:36,816
And I cried.

123
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:38,317
-Right.
-Yeah.

124
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:39,752
You know...

125
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:46,259
I remember we talked about the Tokyo Dome

126
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:49,462
because they play baseball there too.

127
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:53,933
So we were like,
let's both reach the Tokyo Dome

128
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:56,636
following our own paths.

129
00:08:57,403 --> 00:09:00,439
We talked about working that hard.

130
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,981
<i>Setbacks and a promise with a friend.</i>

131
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:13,319
<i>Both have made Matsumura
into what he is today.</i>

132
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:19,692
Let's go then.

133
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,661
This brings back memories.

134
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:29,335
{\an8}<i>When Juri Tanaka wants to reflect
on himself, he comes to this place alone.</i>

135
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:39,679
{\an8}<i>He also experienced a slow period
after joining the agency.</i>

136
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:45,952
-Do you sometimes come here alone?
-Yes, I do come here alone.

137
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:51,357
I don't often open up to other people.

138
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:58,164
Like, about my problems
or about my dreams for the future.

139
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:00,833
It's like...

140
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:04,170
I wonder why I don't.

141
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:07,840
But when I was 18,
I did open up just once to my mom.

142
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:12,812
When I was about 17 or 18, I told her
I wanted to quit.

143
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:14,614
I've only said that once.

144
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,948
Quit Johnny's?

145
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:17,350
Just that once.

146
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:22,154
My mom didn't say anything at the time,
but three days later

147
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:24,991
she told me I could quit
whenever I wanted.

148
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:31,564
So I thought I'd try harder,
and became even more closed off.

149
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:40,640
{\an8}<i>His turning point was when he was
selected to be in a school drama.</i>

150
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:47,079
{\an8}<i>There he would find five friends with
similar apprehensions about the future.</i>

00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:57,390
{\an8}<i>They hit it off and went into direct talks
about creating their own group.</i>

153
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,027
The name is...

154
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:02,695
Yes, the name...

155
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:03,596
Six people...

156
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,868
Six Tones.

157
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:10,903
{\an8}Tones.

158
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:16,542
{\an8}<i>Their group would later be born
under the new name of "SixTONES."</i>

159
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:18,678
{\an8}We each bring our own uniqueness.

160
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:33,025
All six of us were thinking of quitting.
We placed a final bet on SixTONES.

161
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:37,196
So we're continuing to bet on SixTONES.

162
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:42,368
We'll keep going until we lose the bet.

163
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:45,471
And when we feel like we've lost...

164
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:47,973
we'll walk away.

important for gauging fan reactions.</i>

167
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:05,925
{\an8}<i>SixTONES created its style

00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:21,307
{\an8}Congratulations.

172
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:33,519
{\an8}DECEMBER 2021
FEEL DA CITY ARENA TOUR REHEARSAL

173
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:38,657
{\an8}<i>Rehearsals for their New Year's concert
have entered the final stage.</i>

174
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:52,738
That's a wrap.

175
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:55,074
Thank you very much.

176
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,943
How was it?

177
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,678
Well...

178
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:02,481
-It's a bit loose.
-Well, it's tepid.

179
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:09,955
To be honest, during the rehearsal
I only had fun with "Louder."

180
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,925
I just wasn't feeling it.

181
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:16,395
I just never overall felt

182
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:20,533
that we'd captured
the feeling of a SixTONES concert.

183
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,737
<i>They lacked that SixTONES fervor.</i>

184
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,940
<i>They needed major revisions.</i>

185
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,676
We want something strong.

186
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:33,546
-Yeah, totally.
-There aren't many strong songs.

187
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:37,116
Wanna "Special Order" into "Rosy"?

188
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:57,403
I like it.

189
00:13:57,469 --> 00:14:00,472
That felt pretty good to me.

190
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:01,473
Totally fine.

191
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,376
Do you guys think you have the stamina?

192
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:09,014
I think our first lineup was made
considering our physical stamina.

193
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:11,584
-We can do it if we try.
-Okay.

194
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:24,430
<i>They will take up the challenge of a more
rigorous show that pushes their limits.</i>

195
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:34,406
JANUARY 2022
YOKOHAMA ARENA

196
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:40,846
-Let's do our best.
-Yes.

197
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:46,051
-Let's do our best.
-Yes.

198
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:49,355
Off we go then.

199
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:27,613
<i>This was the day
their second album was released.</i>

200
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:32,985
<i>How will the fans react</i>

201
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:38,157
<i>to the six months of work
they put into the album?</i>

202
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:50,769
All right.

203
00:17:56,508 --> 00:18:00,846
<i>And to close the first half of the concert</i>

204
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:05,250
<i>they will play their new song
designed for audience participation.</i>

205
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:20,159
We do love concerts.

206
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:26,064
We didn't care if we couldn't debut
as long as we still got to do concerts.

207
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:29,568
We're most at ease with concerts.

208
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:34,773
Whatever we do, the fans
will come see us because they want to.

209
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:36,675
This is their home.

210
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:44,883
We have the name SixTONES.
SixTONES is our house.

211
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,020
The way we think, the way we feel...,

212
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:52,057
The way we act, the thoughts we have...

213
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:54,226
SixTONES is all over the place.

214
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:58,263
But somewhere we're connected.

215
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:03,302
The group called SixTONES is
connected by music.

216
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:07,339
Some want to do well on variety shows,
and some on TV and movies.

217
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:10,275
We all see where we want to be the best.

218
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:17,082
However, when it comes to music, we feel
that it's definitely the six of us.

219
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:22,020
There's one thing I'm certain about,
and it's not quitting the group.

220
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:26,625
But if someone left,
I wonder if we'd go on.

221
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:29,061
If someone said they're leaving...

222
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:38,470
If SixTONES disbands,
I'll have no reason to try hard.

223
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:43,842
The only thing I'll have left
in my life is eating.

224
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:56,221
If SixTONES disbands, that'll
be the end of my idol career.

225
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:05,264
{\an8}That's how set I am
on working hard with everyone.

226
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:15,073
{\an8}<i>Nobody can be added or subtracted.</i>

227
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:18,977
{\an8}<i>This number is everything to them.</i>

228
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:24,449
{\an8}<i>And most likely, this sentiment
will continue from here on out.</i>

229
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:37,696
{\an8}<i>On the next</i> RIDE ON TIME<i>, it's Kis-My-Ft2,
ushering in their tenth anniversary.</i>

230
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:42,401
{\an8}<i>They speak candidly about their conflicts
and dreams over the decade.</i>

231
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:45,904
{\an8}"I'll burn you up!"

232
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:51,543
{\an8}<i>One day we'd think we could see the light,
and the next day it would be pitch black.</i>

233
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,378
{\an8}We need to make it big.

234
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,248
{\an8}Or there's no point.

235
00:21:56,848 --> 00:22:00,485
{\an8}What is being an idol?
It's nothing I've experienced before.

236
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:03,789
{\an8}<i>A thirty-year reunion.</i>

237
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:06,091
{\an8}Ms. Ishida?

238
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,759
{\an8}Taichan?

239
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:08,960
{\an8}<i>And...</i>

240
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:11,063
{\an8}-Let's go!
-Yeah!

241
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:15,934
{\an8}<i>They walk down a new path
to hone each member's individuality.</i>

242
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:16,902
