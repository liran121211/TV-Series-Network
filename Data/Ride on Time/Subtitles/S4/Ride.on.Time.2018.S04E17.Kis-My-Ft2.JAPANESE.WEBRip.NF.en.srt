00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:05,872
{\an8}<i>August 10th, 2021.</i>

00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:07,841
{\an8}<i>Tokyo Sky Tree.</i>

3
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:10,443
Say cheese.

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:14,881
{\an8}<i>Kis-My-Ft2 was there.</i>

5
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:17,417
{\an8}<i>Kis-My for short.</i>

6
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:23,490
<i>Ten years ago this day,
they made their CD debut.</i>

7
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:27,394
I'll take a pic of the Earth.

8
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,197
<i>Ever since, the seven members
have continued running.</i>

9
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:34,534
You can't dance here.

10
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:38,171
I tried to be the most excited person
in Japan at 9 a.m.

11
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:43,877
Look, you're a little funny.

12
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:45,779
Ready?

13
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:50,050
<i>How do they feel about
these last ten years?</i>

14
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:56,923
It's a miracle we've been together
these last ten years.

15
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:00,894
There was a chance that
the seven of us wouldn't have made it.

16
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,229
There were highs and lows.

17
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:11,104
One day we think we could see the light,
and the next day it would be pitch black.

18
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:15,542
With everything happening
with the anniversary,

19
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:18,445
it makes me wonder what being and idol is.

20
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:22,182
These 10 years didn't go as planned.

21
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:26,052
That's why...

22
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:28,855
things won't go as planned
in the future either.

23
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:36,062
<i>Ten years of struggling
and miraculous dreams.</i>

24
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:44,938
"As long as evil exists in this world,
so shall the flame of justice."

25
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:50,577
<i>And they will have their first
concert with an audience in three years.</i>

26
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:51,878
Let's do it.

27
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:22,408
<i>This is documentary series</i> RIDE ON TIME.

28
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:33,987
<i>Kis-My debuted in 2011
using roller skates as their weapons.</i>

29
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:41,961
{\an8}<i>They conducted a tour
of the five big domes in 2019</i>

30
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:44,564
{\an8}<i>attracting nearly 600,000 people.</i>

31
00:02:55,275 --> 00:03:00,246

their first overseas show in Taiwan.</i>

{\an8}TAIPEI

33
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:06,152
Let's all get fired up!

34

{\an8}<i>Summer of 2021,</i>

35
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:23,703

{\an8}"KIS-MY-FT2 KIS-MY RADIO"

37
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:27,407
{\an8}<i>They all appeared on radio.</i>

38
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:29,776
{\an8}It's true.

39
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:33,680
Did you know that Miyata
loves cucumbers an abnormal amount?

40
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:36,683
I didn't know that.

41
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:42,121
<i>They also filmed videos for fans
they weren't able to meet.</i>

42
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,557
Wow!

43
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:47,160
{\an8}<i>As this was happening,</i>

44
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:52,298
{\an8}<i>the youngest member of the group
Kento Senga expressed his frustrations.</i>

45

{\an8}KENTO SENGA

46
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:58,438
We don't know when Covid is going to end.

47
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:05,511
It takes a lot of stamina and
it's hard to care about someone for years.

48
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,779
Yeah.

49
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,683
So having lost concerts...

50
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:14,687
It was one of the types of entertainments

51
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:18,558
that could move you emotionally.

52
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:23,930
Losing something like that worries me.

53
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:27,033
Will things be okay?

54
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,341
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

55
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:39,379
<i>They started putting together
an arena tour,</i>

56
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:42,348
<i>their first concert in three years

57
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,818
Good morning.

58
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,520
'Morning.

59
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:50,456
It's RIDE ON TIME.

60
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:52,725
Don't mind me.

61
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,663
I know it's early, but let's get started.

62
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:57,797
Great.

63
00:04:57,864 --> 00:05:02,435
The arena tour will start
January 15th of next year.

64
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:04,370
{\an8}As of now, November is...

65
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:08,441
{\an8}<i>Takashi Nikaido is in charge

{\an8}<i>The fountain piece featured
during their 2021 livestream concert</i>

69
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:19,686
{\an8}<i>was a big hit with fans.</i>

70
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:25,725
I never imagined a situation
where we couldn't do a concert

71
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:27,994
in front of an audience.

72
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:33,533
Even if we let in an audience now,
fans aren't able make any noise.

73
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:36,269
Cheers are part of the show.

74
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,638
And that's one thing gone.

75
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:43,543
Which is why our level of
enthusiasm and performance

76
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:45,345
including our songs

77
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:49,482
need to be enough
to entertain our audience.

78
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,355
<i>The show's theme</i>

79
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:58,591
<i>is ten years of gratitude</i>

80
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:04,397
<i>expressed by decorating the stage
with various flowers.</i>

81
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,601
<i>Yokoo makes a suggestion.</i>

82
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:11,504
Can you add another flower?

83
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:17,577
There's a flower called
the dogtooth violet

84
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:20,747
that takes six or seven years to bloom.

85
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:24,517
That seemed just like Kis-My-Ft2.

86
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:26,386
DOGTOOTH VIOLET

87
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:31,824
<i>The dogtooth violet takes
six or seven years to bloom.</i>

88
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:36,729
<i>He explains that they're similar</i>

89
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:40,366
<i>as they took six years
from their formation to debut.</i>

90
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:45,304
I think that's really nice.

91
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:46,572
That's really nice.

92
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:49,642
-That's really nice.
-That's really nice.

93
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:53,413
You know how gratitude is our theme?

94
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:57,683
I thought singing "Re:"
as our first song could be touching.

95
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,886
-I see.
-Just an idea.

96
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,193
<i>Their song "Re:"</i>

97
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:11,431
<i>is a song whose lyrics reflect
their feelings for their fans.</i>

98
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:19,839
{\an8}WHEN WE GOT LOST
YOU KEPT ON LOVING US

99
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,544
{\an8}THANK YOU

100
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:30,483
{\an8}I WANT TO SEND TO YOU

101
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:36,222
{\an8}A LOVE THAT CANNOT BE EXPRESSED IN WORDS

102
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:40,927
I know it's not the kind of song
we start with usually,

103
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:44,430
but that could make it perfect.

104
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,935
Like the face will pop up
with a super close-up.

105
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:52,805
Maybe the eyes would be different.

106
00:07:53,439 --> 00:08:00,413
There won't be a big dance number
around the medium block.

107
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:07,186
<i>First day of rehearsals,</i>

108
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:11,858
<i>Nikaido who is in charge of production
arrives earlier than anyone.</i>

109
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:16,963
-You more excited?
-I'm more excited.

110
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:23,002
<i>Before the members gather,
he checks the things that worry him.</i>

111
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:25,771
Just count at the start.

112
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,507
One, two, three, four.

113
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:30,142
Not there, the top of the song.

114
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:33,679
Right, right, there.

115
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:37,683
<i>The set list is written
on the white board.</i>

116
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:43,890
<i>"Re:" is set to be the opening number
as Tamamori suggested.</i>

117
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:48,427
Since the seven of us are building this,

118
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:53,900
I wouldn't have imagined
starting the show off with "Re:."

119
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:56,969
It's a song with a lot
of emotion behind it,

120
00:08:57,637 --> 00:09:00,840
so I think it's perfect
in regards to gratitude.

121
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:06,045
<i>Rehearsals began.</i>

122
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:16,756
<i>They start with a song
with newly changed choreography.</i>

123
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:29,869
<i>On the first day of rehearsals,
their dancing was rusty.</i>

124
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,376
My body feels so heavy.

125
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:39,045
Over here too.

126
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:46,419
<i>They danced for nearly three hours.</i>

127
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:03,336
{\an8}<i>On this day, they were filming
the music video for a new song.</i>

128
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:04,537
{\an8}From the top.

129
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:10,977
<i>The first on set
is the oldest, Hiromitsu Kitayama.</i>

130
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:12,812
Let's do good work.

131
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,116
{\an8}Seems like the sound will work.

132
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:21,520
{\an8}<i>Their new song "Fear" was the theme song
for a TV drama starring Kitayama.</i>

133
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:25,491
<i>He proposes ideas for
the music video as well.</i>

134
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:28,728
Thank you.

135
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:39,205
<i>They film each member one by one
and composite the footage.</i>

136
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:42,908
Slowly turn this way.

137
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:47,546
<i>There is no dancing or big movements.</i>

138
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:50,916
<i>They only use facial expressions
to depict the song's world.</i>

139
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,152
<i>A performance they've never done before.</i>

140
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:58,324
Just at the threshold
before it gets uncool.

141
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,092
That's true.

142
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,961
You could look a bit higher.

143
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:02,862
Right, a bit.

144
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:05,097
If you looked further back.

145
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:16,776
Wasn't something supposed to come out
at that last part?

146
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:32,191
<i>Kitayama had a strong conviction.</i>

147
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,696
It gets interesting

148
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:40,566
when you've never done it before.

149
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:43,769
Whatever we can imagine

150
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:47,239
doesn't surpass the limits
of our imaginations,

151
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:50,543
which is why we want to try things.

152
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:53,145
That's just more interesting.

153
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,948
I mean, doing interesting stuff,

154
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:59,418
we need to betray expectations
in a good way.

155
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:02,354
You know?

156
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:05,958
It requires courage though.

157
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:09,495
We don't want the people watching
to get bored.

158
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,064
That's always on our mind.

159
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:16,502
<i>Since their debut,</i>

160
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:20,372
<i>Kis-My has released
around 300 songs in ten years.</i>

161
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:25,244
<i>What they've strived for
was a new form of idol.</i>

162
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:53,739
<i>When you think of Kis-My-Ft2...</i>

163
00:12:57,877 --> 00:13:01,547
<i>...you think of the roller skates
they've worn since their debut.</i>

164
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:12,391
<i>Even their first concert
in three years with an audience</i>

165
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,661
<i>cannot do without
a roller-skate performance.</i>

166
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:26,839
It's a weapon I really cherish.

167
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:32,178
It all began when Mr. Johnny asked us
if we could wear roller skates.

168
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:38,784
Just a different way to present
ourselves or something.

169
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:45,758
It's like the type of excitement
when the theme park mascot comes out.

170
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:49,161
Personally, I want to wear them.

171
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:51,230
Even when I'm an old man.

172
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,146
Good work.

173
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:09,348
<i>9 p.m.</i>

174
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:13,085
<i>One member stayed late after rehearsals.</i>

175
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,322
That's a good transition.

176
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:18,257
<i>It's Nikaido.</i>

177
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:21,093
-Like Chrome Hearts.
-Yes!

178
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,864
<i>The meeting for the concert video began.</i>

179
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,168
You know...

180
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:30,603
Actually,

181
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:36,075
what if the choreography
and video were connected?

182
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:41,413
-You know how the song goes like...
-Right.

183
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,818
And then a video that relates to
"SHE! HER! HER!" pops up.

184
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,686
If the sound can...

185
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:52,191
<i>He had a commitment to the production.</i>

186
00:14:53,192 --> 00:15:00,032
I feel that there's nothing better for
an audience than to see us live.

187
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:07,840
So we should never make a video
that draws the attention away from us.

188
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,709
If the video distracts from the group,

189
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:16,081
then I would question
what we are trying to show.

190
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:20,920
Whatever way we can showcase the group

191
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:24,790
the most is the best in my opinion.

192
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:32,531
<i>This is a radio program
Nikaido is a part of.</i>

193
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,732
This is <i>RIDE ON TIME</i>.

194
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:36,902
I'm so nervous having a camera here!

195
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:40,072
-They won't use this.
-Why not?

196
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:43,175
-It's not that type of show.
-It's not?

197
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:45,377
-That was a nice one.
-Sorry.

198
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,947
That one had some snap.

199
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,415
{\an8}RADIO RECORDING

200
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:53,052
{\an8}<i>Nikaido calls himself Kis-My's
variety specialist.</i>

201
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:58,757
<i>He polishes his talking and
comedy skills with jobs such as these.</i>

202
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,196
I love Atsuko Maeda,

203
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:07,299
so I put a neck pillow she used
in a Ziplock bag.

204
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:08,934
That makes you a pervert.

205
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:11,270
I'm not a pervert. This was 15 years ago.

206
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:13,839
It's not that old.

207
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:14,907
What the heck?

208
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:18,210
We don't need a boy scout, Takashi.

209
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:20,679
You seem off your game today.

210
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:21,580
I'm not.

211
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:28,287
So they let me have fun like this.

212
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:30,322
Having Mr. Kuro-chan...

213
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,925
Don't say it like Ms. Agnes Chan.

214
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:37,629
It's like he has disease that makes you
constantly interrupt people with a joke.

215
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,566
The leader will get mad.

216
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:41,834
Enough, Shiro-chan.

217
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,302
That's the wrong color!

218
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:45,437
Good grief.

219
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:52,011
<i>There was a shoot going on this day.</i>

220
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:54,246
So the Tokyo version...

221
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:58,083
<i>It was the opening video
they would use for the arena tour.</i>

222
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:01,420
Ready, action.

223
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:05,758
<i>The theme this time
would be to thank their fans</i>

224
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:09,328
<i>for all their support
these past ten years since their debut.</i>

225
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:15,401
<i>Each member would compose
a letter to the fans.</i>

226
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:18,337
That's nice.

227
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:32,284
<i>There was a special sentiment behind it.</i>

228
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:34,787
Looking good.

229
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:40,259
The concerts we're privileged enough
to do every year

230
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:46,432
are our way to show
our appreciation to the fans.

231
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:49,535
We each do it in our own style,

232
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:52,604
but that sentiment
is even bigger this year

233
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:54,273
from not being able to see them.

234
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:56,742
We're celebrating
our ten year anniversary,

235
00:17:56,809 --> 00:18:03,782
because of our fans and their support.

236
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,386
They give us energy.

237
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:13,826
Often fans would tell us,
"Your concerts lifted our spirits."

238
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:16,061
And other comments,

239
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:20,265
but I feel like we're given even more.

240
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:23,602
We get a burst of adrenaline, too.

241
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:32,678
I feel like we're the ones
getting saved a lot instead.

242
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:36,515
So this tour really is...

243
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:42,488
something that will become very special.

244
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:45,424
Ready, go.

245
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:51,096
{\an8}<i>Kis-My's center, Yuta Tamamori.</i>

{\an8}YUTA TAMAMORI

247
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:55,434
{\an8}<i>He was undertaking a certain challenge.</i>

248
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:03,108
<i>He's been learning Chinese
the last three years.</i>

249
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:05,043
Ready?

250
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,045
I'm really happy.

251
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:10,115
Yes, there was another grammar point here.

252
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:14,720
<i>It all started in 2019.</i>

253
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:21,960
{\an8}<i>Their first overseas performance

Please introduce yourselves.

256
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:31,370
We are Kis-My-Ft2.

257
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:37,276
<i>Ever since, he's been continuing
Chinese lessons with Miyata.</i>

TOSHIYA MIYATA

259
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,811
I'm really happy.

260
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:40,812
I'm really happy.

261
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:42,481
Well done.

262
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,185
Have you been busy?

263
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:48,620
A bit busy lately.

264
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,589
What are you doing?

265
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:58,530
I play games all day.

266
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:00,098
That's good.

267
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:07,439
{\an8}<i>He also began a YouTube channel
in December of 2021.</i>

268

{\an8}<i>He plays games with friends like</i>

269
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:13,645
{\an8}<i>Daiki Arioka from Hey! Say! JUMP
and Miyata who also like games.</i>

270
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,914
Okay, let's go.

271
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:18,116
That's fast.

272
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:19,585
-Whoops.
-Hey!

273
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:20,786
-Sorry.
-Tamamori?

274
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,256
Yes!

275
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:25,390
Yes!

276
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:31,096
<i>It's a new challenge for Tamamori.</i>

277
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:34,433
Being Kis-My's center,

278
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:40,072
I've always been the one to
do something new.

279
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:43,842
A lot of things I've never done before.

280
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:48,580
I was told to just challenge myself.

281
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:50,782
You know...

282
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:57,623
that's something I want to continue doing.

283
00:20:57,689 --> 00:21:02,694
There's a feeling that pushes me through,

284
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:07,432
but I'm not the type to say it out loud.

285
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:12,604
<i>He pushes himself his own way.</i>

286
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:18,910
{\an8}<i>Next time, Kitayama takes up
a new challenge as well.</i>

287
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:26,551
{\an8}We're always evolving.

288
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:30,322
{\an8}When that stops, we stop.

289

{\an8}<i>Th ever-evolving Kis-My-Ft2.</i>

290
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:38,196
{\an8}A world we've never build before.

291
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:39,965
{\an8}A view we've never seen.

292
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:44,369
{\an8}I'd love to be able to grow
by focusing on things like that.

293
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:52,311
{\an8}<i>But Taisuke Fujigaya had certain
apprehensions as he grew as a performer.</i>

294
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:57,049
{\an8}It makes me wonder what being and idol is.

295
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:01,753
{\an8}I wonder what it is.
