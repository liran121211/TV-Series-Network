00:00:02,435 --> 00:00:06,573
<i>Kis-My-Ft2 is celebrating the
tenth anniversary of its CD debut.</i>

2
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:12,145
{\an8}<i>Their first show in three years
with a crowd was approaching.</i>

3
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:21,554
-Does it seem okay?
-Seems okay.

4
00:00:22,055 --> 00:00:25,992
When they think we disappeared,
we just kind of slink in.

5
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:29,596
So once the video is off,
we shouldn't stand?

6
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:35,435
<i>Small adjustments are made past midnight.</i>

7
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:42,509
You should go home.
None of this is going to be interesting.

8
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:47,013
We raised the bottom by a meter.

9
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,748
I want to make it 800.

10
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:50,050
-A bit lower?
-Yeah.

11
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:54,421
Can you drop
the smaller chandelier by 200?

12
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:20,013
<i>This is documentary series</i> Ride on Time.

13
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:32,692
<i>Ten days before the concert, the costumes
arrived at the rehearsal room.</i>

14
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:43,169
Wow, this is super cool.

15
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:44,704
Really awesome.

16
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,240
This is exciting.

17
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:50,343
Stuff like this makes me happy.

18
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:53,813
Good morning.

19
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:57,784
<i>Yuta Tamamori was in charge of costumes.</i>

20
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,387
{\an8}These look great!

21
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:05,425
{\an8}These look great!

22
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:07,760
{\an8}<i>However...</i>

23
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:13,900
You know, I want more black.

24
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,935
-It's not finished, right?
-No.

25
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:20,707
I wonder if it will get darker.
It's a bit faded, don't you think?

26
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:24,878
Um, we just put the fringe in to test it.

27
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:27,780
We might not need it.

28
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:30,950
This one looks a bit white.

29
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:33,753
Maybe it depends on the person.

30
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:38,258
Without this, it'll end up too simple,

31
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:43,530
so I'm thinking of adding enough
to achieve about this sort of balance.

32
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:48,735
<i>There was a certain message
instilled in these costumes.</i>

33
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:50,603
It's an F.

34
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,272
Oh look at that. It's an F.

35
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:54,774
-Look.
-Wow.

36
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:57,110
Where's my Y?

37
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,878
It's here, right?

38
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:00,346
Amazing.

39
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:05,418
<i>Each of their initials
were embroidered on.</i>

40
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:12,458
<i>And on their back was an X to commemorate
their tenth anniversary.</i>

41
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:17,096
<i>The next costume...</i>

42
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:19,732
-I put one on?
-Yes.

43
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:24,003
-What should I do with this here?
-Isn't it cuter open?

44
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:27,040
Like this? Yeah, I think
I might like it open too.

45
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:30,176
Then we'll take this part in a bit more.

46
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:31,744
How many times now?

47
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:35,682
I think this is about my fifth
or sixth time doing costumes.

48
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:40,987
But I'm still making new discoveries
of what looks good on everyone.

49
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,022
I like clothes,

50
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:49,729
so I want everyone to wear
something cool that motivates them.

51
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,132
That's how I'm operating.

52
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,935
Please turn around.

53
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,006
Thank you.

54
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:05,912
Your jackets will also have
the little chandelier thing on Senga's.

55
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:11,317
<i>What did the members think
of their three newly made costumes?</i>

56
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:16,122
Up until now we were in track suits.

57
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:18,992
So I think the mood will change.

58
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:20,660
True.

59
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:23,896
You get that feeling of a live show.

60
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:27,200
We'll be doing a dress rehearsal later.

61
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:32,605
Do you find yourself trying not to dirty
the costume at rehearsal?

62
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:33,806
I totally get that.

63
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:37,510
If we get it dirty here,
it'll be dirty for our first show.

64
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:40,113
It's over if you trip.

65
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:42,849
The costume team will lose it.

66
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:45,485
"It's rehearsal so don't dance so much."

67
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:48,488
But if we don't, Nika will yell at us.

68
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:49,756
We're in a pickle.

69
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:52,392
That's where we always are.

70
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,926
Yeah.

71
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:56,229
Boom. You were slow.

72
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,432
No, it's this posture.

73
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:05,104
<i>They were set to have
a dress rehearsal on this day.</i>

74
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,941
<i>But then...</i>

75
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:10,943
Can I put my arm through?

76
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,913
Yeah, sure. It's up to you.

77
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,949
I'm the only one
like this during "A10TION."

78
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:19,118
I don't put my arms through...

79
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:23,489
<i>Tamamori was also concerned about
this overcoat worn over the shoulders.</i>

80
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,560
If I ever have to put it over my shoulders

81
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:29,529
or need to take it off...

82
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:31,798
What would be the best for you?

83
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:34,600
Having it on your shoulders
is going to be hard.

84
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,669
When I have to dance.

85
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:39,439
-It's hard to dance in, huh?
-Yeah.

86
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,673
Which means...

87
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,875
<i>Do they prioritize the design</i>

88
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:44,877
<i>or the dancing?</i>

89
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:46,546
Yeah, that's cool.

90
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:29,756
The seven of us are at our best
and our coolest when we're on stage.

91
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:34,093
It'd make me happy if people saw us

92
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,629
and thought we were cool.

93
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:41,868
It would really make my day
if people felt that way.

94
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,270
All decorations go up...

95
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:49,275
{\an8}<i>Taisuke Fujigaya posed a question
to himself ten years after their debut.</i>

96
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:53,713
I don't even know myself.

97
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:58,518
I wondered what I'd think
after ten years had passed.

98
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:02,355
Like, I've learned how to do this or that.

99
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,591
But I haven't learned
to do anything at all.

100
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:10,563
What's going to happen?

101
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:19,672
<i>There was someone Fujigaya
couldn't wait to see.</i>

102
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:21,007
Third floor?

103
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:27,814
<i>It's his kindergarten teacher,
who he loved as a child.</i>

104
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:31,918
It was 30 years ago.

105
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:38,324
I wonder if she remembers me.

106
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:39,859
Excuse me.

107
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,463
They're dancing.

108
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,998
Excuse me.

109
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:49,569
Excuse me.

110
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,640
What?

111
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:57,043
Ms. Ishida?

112
00:07:57,109 --> 00:07:59,812
-Oh, long time no see.
-Taichan?

113
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,748
What? Taichan?

114
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,218
It's Taisuke Fujigaya. Is that really you?

115
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:06,219
Yes.

116
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:07,887
It's been a long time.

117
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:10,089
Such a long time.

118
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,023
Hold on.

119
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,425
{\an8}How are you?

120
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,326
{\an8}I'm doing well.

121
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:15,328
{\an8}Really? Thank you for meeting me.

122
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:16,229
{\an8}Of course.

123
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:20,600
<i>Ms. Ishida left kindergarten teaching</i>

124
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:25,238
<i>and now provides mobility assistance
to people with disabilities.</i>

125
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:27,139
Oh, right, sorry.

126
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:31,978
-Here you go.
-It's me!

127
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:33,279
Yes.

128
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,047
Oh no.

129
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:37,817
My drawing ability
hasn't improved since then.

130
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:43,322
I haven't improved at all.
My drawings still look like this today.

131
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:48,160
Looking at this makes me feel
so many emotions.

132
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:50,196
It makes me laugh.

133
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,866
-A field trip?
-Digging up potatoes.

134
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:57,737
Stone-faced.

135
00:08:57,803 --> 00:08:59,739
I haven't changed.

136
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:04,610
Everyone's smiling,
yet I'm standing there stone-faced.

137
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:09,916
You would do this with your hands.

138
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:11,384
I loved the hero shows.

139
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,586
So many hero poses of you.

140
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,388
Is that so?

141
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:22,828
I was looking forward to what I would
be thinking after ten years.

142
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:26,666
After ten years, like...

143
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:31,804
Would I think that I've learned
some skill, or I've gained confidence?

144
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:36,475
I was looking forward to that
going into the tenth year.

145
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:37,977
You never know.

146
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:40,413
-No?
-Not at all.

147
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:46,118
It goes for work, too.
The ten-year mark is just the beginning.

148
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:52,558
When I got to my tenth year,
I was just starting to enjoy it.

149
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:56,228
Things were just getting fun.

150
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:57,663
Is that so?

151
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:03,302
I mean, over the last ten years
you've been learning to sing and dance.

152
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:06,973
It was a long process, wasn't it?

153
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:10,576
So you've reached a certain level by now.

154
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:14,814
Now you just entered a different stage,
figuring out what to do next.

155
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,915
I see.

156
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:21,420
These last ten years
have been mainly input for me.

157
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:23,723
So from this point,

158
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:26,525
I'll be thinking and acting on my own.

159
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:31,297
If you earnestly live true to yourself,

160
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,666
it will all work out one day.

161
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:36,035
You need to believe in yourself.

162
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:38,537
Yes.

163
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:42,341
Even now, I often think of you.

164
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:44,610
-Really?
-Really.

165
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:48,347
<i>Fujigaya had this to say
after meeting his teacher.</i>

166
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:50,616
That takes me back.

167
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:52,652
It's not impatience,

168
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:56,922
but I figured I should be able
to do something after ten years.

169
00:10:57,456 --> 00:11:00,059
I probably need to be proud of myself.

170
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:03,496
I asked myself what I've learned to do.

171
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:07,066
And I haven't learned
to do anything at all.

172
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:12,805
I'm just blessed with my fans
and the people around me.

173
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:15,875
And I have a means
to take on these challenges.

174
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:22,114
And I realized that
this is a new start for me.

175
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:26,585
I want to be something to someone.

176
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:28,220
Something like that.

177
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:30,790
Though it's conceited to say so.

178
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:36,295
If people can find a moment of happiness
after discovering Kisumai, then great.

179
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:42,635
I guess I want to focus on
the fans and staff

180
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:48,507
and make them feel glad
they supported Kisumai all this time.

181
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,947
<i>The middle of January.</i>

182
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:57,850
{\an8}ECOPA ARENA

183
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:04,657
{\an8}<i>The seven members arrived in Shizuoka
for the first day of the arena tour.</i>

184
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:10,229
Good morning.

185
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:18,771
<i>It's the day before the arena tour.</i>

186
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:26,378
<i>On set,</i>

187
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:30,616
<i>there's a flower
that Yokoo has likened to Kisumai.</i>

188
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:34,553
<i>Called the dogtooth violet,
it takes six years to bloom.</i>

189
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:42,695
<i>Nikaido, in charge of direction, had this
to say after looking at the stage.</i>

190
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:45,931
{\an8}I mean, the set is...

191
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:46,966
{\an8}TAKASHI NIKAIDO

192
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:49,668
{\an8}...incredibly beautiful.

193
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:54,473
It's been three years since we were
in front of an audience.

194
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,374
I'm uh...

195
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:01,247
I'm excited.

196
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,150
Good morning, everyone.

197
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:05,851
Good morning.

198
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:08,621
Let's smash this Shizuoka rehearsal.

199
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:10,923
We'll do our best!

200
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,860
<i>The rehearsal began.</i>

201
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:18,764
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

202
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,700
That's going back, right?

203
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:25,437
No, somewhere the camera can get it.

204
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:27,773
Maybe further back.

205
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:54,967
Please give it a check.

206
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:57,570
It's okay.

207
00:13:57,636 --> 00:14:00,406
Please raise the A-dash click a bit more.

208
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:04,743
<i>The final full rehearsal.</i>

209
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:11,584
<i>Nikaido separated from the group
and headed into the audience seats.</i>

210
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:15,187
-It's hard to see over there.
-Okay.

211
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:17,389
You can hear Nika's voice.

212
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:25,097
<i>He checks the show
from the fan's perspective.</i>

213
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:42,982
Key is the fifth step.

214
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:47,586
So it's five, six, seven.

215
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:51,957
At the point they'll think we disappeared,
we just kind of glided in.

216
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:53,659
If we crouch down too much,

217
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:57,329
it seemed as though
they'd just be able to see us.

218
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:00,866
So when the video turns off,
we shouldn't stand yet?

219
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:04,937
Does "One Kiss" need to be that early?

220
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:06,972
Not a lot goes on in the middle.

221
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,575
I guess that's for the best.

222
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:19,785
<i>Nikaido has his final meeting
with the staff.</i>

223
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:23,756
The square light up above.

224
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,557
The white one?

225
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:27,626
Sync that up with the clapping.

226
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:36,702
I want the lighting timed to the clapping
instead of keeping that tempo.

227
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:41,974
We have it set to red at the end of
"NAKED", and there's something after.

228
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:46,011
-You want it to end on red.
-Yes, on just red.

229
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:47,613
Okay.

230
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:58,824
You should go home.
None of this is going to be interesting.

231
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:06,799
-That's its original position?
-Yes.

232
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:08,634
So...

233
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:11,770
Either way, you want to raise
the lowest one a bit?

234
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:19,478
<i>He wasn't happy with
the chandelier on the main stage.</i>

235
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:21,981
Okay.

236
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,817
We raised the bottom by a meter.

237
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:26,585
I want to make it 800.

238
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,853
-A bit lower?
-Yeah.

239
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,024
Can you drop
the smaller chandelier by 200?

240
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:37,830
<i>Twenty centimeters. They continue
making small adjustments.</i>

241
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:47,873
I like this.

242
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,875
The light hits the truss, too.

243
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:51,643
Yeah.

244
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,114
Like this?

245
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,815
It's beautiful.

246
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,085
How's the V motion?

247
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:02,354
It's lowered at that slow speed.

248
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:05,591
<i>Spot checks continued past midnight.</i>

{\an8}<i>It's the first day of the arena tour.</i>

251
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:14,900
Good morning.

252
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:19,538
<i>The seven members get ready
for the concert upon arrival at the venue.</i>

253
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:21,607
Good morning.

254
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:43,462
Attention to all those whose
venue entry time has arrived.

255
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:48,133
<i>Their last show with a crowd
was three years ago.</i>

256
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,070
<i>...please notify the nearest staff member.</i>

257
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:56,775
Off we go!

258
00:17:57,609 --> 00:18:01,313
It's been three years
since our last show with fans.

259
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,815
Let's make it a good one.

260
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:05,050
-Let's go!
-Yeah!

261
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:06,985
Let's do it.
