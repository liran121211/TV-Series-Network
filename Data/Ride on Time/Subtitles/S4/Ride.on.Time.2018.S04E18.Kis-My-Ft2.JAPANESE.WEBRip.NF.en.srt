1
00:00:01,735 --> 00:00:04,170
Now open your eyes wide.

2
00:00:04,237 --> 00:00:06,439
Ready?

3
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:08,908
Okay, look straight into the camera.

4
00:00:08,975 --> 00:00:12,112
<i>They are filming footage
for a concert show.</i>

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,215
Now dart your eyes around.

6
00:00:15,882 --> 00:00:18,585
Miyacchi, you can move your mouth,

7
00:00:18,651 --> 00:00:21,955
but keep your neck still
as much as possible.

8
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:22,856
Okay.

9
00:00:22,922 --> 00:00:26,393
We're going to composite the footage
using different parts.

10
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:28,294
-Okay.
-Thanks.

11
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:33,967
{\an8}<i>Kis-My-Ft2, Kis-My for short.</i>

12
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:37,837
{\an8}<i>What are they striving for
as they enter their 10th anniversary?</i>

13
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,109
What is something people aren't doing?

14
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:48,048
There's this mainstream line at Johnny's.

15
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:49,649
That's totally great.

16
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:52,185
But something outside that,

17
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:56,489
something that nobody has really done.

18
00:00:56,556 --> 00:01:00,994
That might be something
we're looking into.

19
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,519
<i>This is documentary series</i> RIDE ON TIME.

20
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:33,059
{\an8}<i>Kis-My members have
rich solo careers as well.</i>

21
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:38,631
Give them a nice pose there and...

22
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:39,532
{\an8}TAISUKE FUJIGAYA

23
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:44,904
{\an8}<i>Taisuke Fujigaya is reprising
his role in the musical</i> Don Juan

24
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:47,207
{\an8}<i>after a two year break.</i>

25
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:49,742
{\an8}REHEARSAL FOR <i>DON JUAN</i>

26
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:53,246
{\an8}-Don Juan! Don Juan!
-Hey!

27
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:57,750
{\an8}I'm not your friend.

28
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:02,255
Who do you think I am?

29
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:08,761
<i>They were running through the final
dress rehearsal before their opening day.</i>

30
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:15,301
<i>Fujigaya was playing Don Juan,
the legendary playboy.</i>

31
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,909
<i>What were his thoughts on this play?</i>

32
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:25,311
It's hard work.

33
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:28,648
I get pushed to the limit daily.

34
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:32,318
The way you project your voice
is totally different.

35
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:34,754
It's hard, I still can't do it.

36
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:39,792
I'm super popular
when it becomes break time.

37
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:43,630
The producers would come

38
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:46,799
and give me notes
on my singing and dancing.

39
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:50,703
They all just surround me.
And I'm just like, "Oh no..."

40
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:51,771
Really?

41
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,843
You know where you charge Rafael?

42
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,779
Your shoulder drops in this motion.

43
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,148
You want to keep the shoulder parallel.

44
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:03,516
Keep it...

45
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,685
<i>He receives sword fighting direction.</i>

46
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:08,855
{\an8}<i>The producer too.</i>

47
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:12,358
{\an8}PRODUCER
HIROKAZU IKUTA

48
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:16,296
{\an8}<i>This is the popularity Fujigaya
was referring to.</i>

49
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:22,235
<i>Rehearsal ran for 12 hours.</i>

50
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:29,309
Excuse me.

51
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:36,049
My body's exhausted before opening day.

52
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:41,688
Feels more like mid-production exhaustion.

53
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:45,024
<i>Fujigaya mostly keeps to himself.</i>

54
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:48,861
<i>When asked about their 10th anniversary,</i>

55
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,698
<i>he gave an unexpected answer.</i>

56
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:56,202
With everything happening
with the anniversary,

57
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:58,972
it makes me wonder what being and idol is.

58
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:08,381
What kind of idol can I be?

59
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:13,920
You know, I'm searching for it.

60
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:19,325
I wonder what it is.

61
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:22,228
I've never had this before.

62
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:27,000
There's this new feeling
I've never had before.

63
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:28,534
What is it?

64
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:33,706
<i>What is an idol?</i>

65
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:43,016
<i>Fujigaya took this musical as a challenge.</i>

66
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:46,386
Let's go!

67
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,454
Yeah!

68
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:54,360
<i>The curtains open.</i>

69
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:03,136
{\an8}You've gone too far this time.

70
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:07,373
{\an8}Did you call me here just to tell me that?

71
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,374
{\an8}MUSICAL <i>DON JUAN</i>

72
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:10,343
{\an8}<i>Including Tokyo and Osaka,</i>

73
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:15,181
{\an8}<i>there were 32 performances
over a period of a month.</i>

74
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:18,351
What did it feel like when you killed him?

75
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:19,986
Nothing.

76
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:26,225
FINAL SHOW

77
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:28,728
<i>He had this to say at the end.</i>

78
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:33,533
Some of you may be seeing me
for the first time.

79
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:37,737
I'm normally being an idol in Kis-My-Ft2.

80
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:43,676
So please come see us
if there's a show nearby.

81
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:47,146
We are a group of six charismatic guys.

82
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:51,851
If Don Juan leads to other
exciting experiences, then great.

83
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:58,091
I hope that as entertainment progresses,
it's able to bring you more happiness.

84
00:05:58,157 --> 00:06:00,226
Sorry for the rambling.

85
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:01,694
It's what I believe.

86
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:04,163
I'm blessed. Thank you.

87
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:11,137
Yay!

88
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,306
Thanks!

89
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,208
Yay!

90
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:20,279
<i>Fujiyama continued forward
as he kept up his search.</i>

91
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:27,153
<i>Another member searching for something...</i>

92
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:32,291
{\an8}<i>is Kento Senga, the member
in charge of choreography.</i>

93
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:39,732
<i>He's one of the highly skilled
dancers in Kis-My.</i>

94
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,710
One and two and...

95
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:53,379
<i>He is coming up with new choreography</i>

96
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:56,416
<i>for the song "Girl is mine"
for the upcoming arena tour.</i>

97
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:04,056
I think the count is off.

98
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:06,893
Five, six, seven, eight.

99
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,162
One, two, and three.

100
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:13,266
Four and five and six, seven, eight.

101
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:16,302
One, two, three, four.

102
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:18,070
Thank you.

103
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,675
<i>Senga doesn't compromise his dancing.</i>

104
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:26,145
<i>There is a reason behind his commitment.</i>

105
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:34,454
We're all middle-aged,
with the youngest being 30.

106
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:39,192
We're gradually drifting away
from dancing.

107
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:44,630
You know,
people think it's because of our age

108
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:46,899
and that's kind of annoying.

109
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:51,904
So we want to show the fans
our continued evolution

110
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:58,010
and make them realize
that Kis-My is still cool.

111
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:00,813
So I tried to come up
with a new dance number

112
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:06,285
that is going to get them excited.

113
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,132
<i>He's having trouble with the choreography.</i>

114
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:31,210
I tried incorporating steps

115
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:36,349
which we haven't used very much,
into this new choreography.

116
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:43,155
It's pretty simple right now,
so it'll need more revisions.

117
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:50,696
<i>Senga had another talent
the group acknowledged.</i>

118
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,267
<i>That talent is...</i>

119
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:07,179
<i>He started focusing on his artwork
a few years ago,</i>

120
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:09,615
<i>and continues to this day.</i>

121
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:10,950
ARTIST: KENTO SENGA

122
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:16,756
<i>He tells us how he started his artwork.</i>

123
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:23,129
It was a way to relieve stress. You know?

124
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:26,933
It was basically my toilet.

125
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:29,135
It feels good to go to the bathroom.

126
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:32,972
When I create my art,

127
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:37,443
I empty my mind, and just draw freely.

128
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:42,715
I take my accumulated stress
and put it in my art.

129
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:46,052
So all my works are negative.

130
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:55,428
{\an8}<i>During their debut period,
Tamamori, Fujigaya, and Kitayama</i>

131
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:57,630
{\an8}<i>were the main members of the group.</i>

132
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:04,804
<i>However, Yokoo, Senga, Miyata, and Nikaido</i>

133
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:08,874
<i>weren't in the same spotlight
as the three of them.</i>

134
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:13,613
There was a distinct difference

135
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:18,417
within the group in terms of
the amount and type of work we got.

136
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:20,720
It was completely different.

137
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:25,257
And it wasn't divided equally.

138
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,596
"Why don't they give me
more parts to sing?"

139
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:34,900
"Why am I dancing in the corner,
when I'm good at it?"

140
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:39,438
I thought it was important
to find a place to vent.

141
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,208
That, for me, was art.

142
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,279
This isn't dark at all.

143
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,250
But to me...

144
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:54,553
<i>After earning recognition
within the group,</i>

145
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:59,392
<i>he was put in charge
of Kis-My's concert logos,</i>

146
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,994
<i>giving him a strong, new weapon.</i>

147
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:09,135
In these last ten years,
we spent so much time together,

148
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:14,173
and the more we spend together,

149
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,410
the group will only get more interesting,

150
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:22,148
and we'll become
even more complete as a unit.

151
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:26,986
The future of Kis-My

152
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:32,491
is something that looks very bright to me.

153
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:39,565
<i>He finally found choreography
he's happy with.</i>

154
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:47,239
So the hand and shoulder
should be the same direction.

155
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:49,542
And the opposite shoulder too.

156
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:54,346
Front, then step to the side.

157
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:55,514
Then...

158
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:57,717
-Back here?
-Yes.

159
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,411
<i>Between rehearsals,</i>

160
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:30,349
{\an8}<i>Hiromitsu Kitayama begins a meeting
with the staff.</i>

161
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:36,856
<i>Kitayama is directing the concert video
for their new song "Fear."</i>

162
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:42,328
<i>In the music video,</i>

163
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:47,733
<i>they did something new,
only using their facial expressions.</i>

164
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:54,940
<i>These are the storyboards of his idea.</i>

165
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:59,678
<i>However, Kitayama...</i>

166
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,352
<i>A meeting for the concert video.</i>

167
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:10,456
<i>When Kitayama looked at the storyboard...</i>

168
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,093
Let's start here.

169
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,998
So my thoughts are,

170
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:23,002
instead of fading in from these trees,

171
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:27,506
it'd be more impactful
to just cut to the eyeballs.

172
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:28,974
-Impactful?
-Yes.

173
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:32,111
And maybe the trees
are reflected in the eyes,

174
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:36,048
or a butterfly, letting you know
that's the scene.

175
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:40,653
<i>During the meeting,
Kitayama repeated himself.</i>

176
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:46,325
So what I'm going for here
is something creepy.

177
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:49,061
I think it's creepier to be facing it.

178
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:51,430
I thought the mix would be creepy.

179
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,798
You mean...?

180
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:55,868
The actual measurements are a bit larger,

181
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:59,438
but having a big one mixed in
could be creepier.

182
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:02,007
<i>"Creepy."</i>

183
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:06,712
<i>An image not often associated with idols.</i>

184
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:12,885
The worst is if you don't leave
any impression either way.

185
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:19,191
But you know,
if there aren't any artistic qualities,

186
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:23,329
you just have to be cool
inside this neat and tight package.

187
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:29,335
So, it's about how artistic and cool

188
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:30,936
you can do it.

189
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:35,908
<i>It's the day of the shoot.</i>

190
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:38,777
Ready?

191
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:40,980
Okay, look straight into the camera.

192
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,215
Now open your eyes wide.

193
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,251
Nice and big.

194
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:51,056
<i>They are cutting sections
from the member's faces,</i>

195
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:55,027
<i>to create a visual
they've never seen before.</i>

196
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:58,397
Now dart your eyes around.

197
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:01,333
That won't move.

198
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,771
<i>How does Kitayama feel about
their 10 year anniversary?</i>

199
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:11,744
Personally, it's only been 10 years.

200
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:18,984
Although, it makes me think about
what we need to do

201
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:25,090
in order for us to continue
another 15 or 20 years.

202
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:32,398
I'd want to have the courage
to be able to change with the times,

203
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:36,001
to stay interesting.

204
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:39,505
But also we're originally...

205
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:45,110
a group created by Mr. Johnny.

206
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:49,381
So we need that passion
to never forget our roots.

207
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:56,689
<i>Kis-My-Ft2 was formed in 2005.</i>

208
00:15:57,222 --> 00:16:01,427
<i>It took six years
until they were able to debut.</i>

209
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:07,199
<i>Kitayama looks back at that time.</i>

210
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:13,005
I never got an explanation
of why Mr. Johnny created this group,

211
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:16,742
or what he wanted us to be.

212
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:21,714
He never gave us a real explanation.

213
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,485
I was never told,
"You're here because of this!"

214
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:31,190
It all started with being told
to come over.

215
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:34,259
But there has to be some reason.

216
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:41,567
That's where we'll find some clues of
how we can reach the next level

217
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:43,936
as a group.

218
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:54,246
<i>Kitayama had something he wanted to do.</i>

219
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:56,248
It's open.

220
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:58,917
Excuse me.

221
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:01,587
Yes?

222
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:05,491
Excuse me. Hello.
I'm Kitayama. Nice to meet you.

223
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:06,825
Please come in.

224
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:12,064
<i>He experiences a tea ceremony
for the first time.</i>

225
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:17,403
First to prepare, go to the <i>tokonoma</i>.

226
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:22,207
<i>He reads the hanging scroll
as he learns the proper etiquette.</i>

227
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:30,482
{\an8}TEA MASTER
MUNEKAZU AKIYAMA

228
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,184
{\an8}Excuse us.

229
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:46,598
<i>The first thing served wasn't tea,
but a traditional</i> kaiseki <i>meal.</i>

230
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:52,538
Yes, then return the top one after.

231
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:54,807
-Like this?
-Then hand it to her.

232
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:58,777
So I do this first.

233
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:00,179
-Here you go.
-Wow.

234
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,715
<i>Then rice wine.</i>

235
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:09,955
<i>This is called</i> chaji<i>,
the proper way to treat guests.</i>

236
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:20,599
So you put it on top of the bigger bowl.

237
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,335
Put it on top.

238
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:24,269
Exactly.

239
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:30,642
Kaiseki <i>meals
are meals served to complement the tea.</i>

240
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:46,391
The sauce is very good.

241
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,826
Yes, delicious.

242
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:49,862
The mustard stings.

243
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:51,697
You have to mix it in!

244
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:53,132
I'm supposed to mix it?

245
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:56,168
Did you see the yellow stuff?

246
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:57,870
You have to mix that in.

247
00:18:57,936 --> 00:18:59,771
I didn't know that.

248
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,074
Mix it in with the miso.

249
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,211
I thought I was supposed to eat it as is.

250
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:14,119
<i>It's been two hours.</i>

251
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:19,525
<i>It's time for tea.</i>

252
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:13,912
How is it?

253
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:16,648
You don't have to finish it all.

254
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,784
Wow.

255
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:27,926
<i>He went into the tea ceremony searching
for something missing from himself.</i>

256
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:32,130
<i>What did he feel?</i>

257
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:37,603
I thought that
this could be entertainment.

258
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:42,674
It wasn't like "Drink the tea!"

259
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:47,946
There are different varieties to enjoy,

260
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:52,884
and different preparations,
and different pots and cups.

261
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:58,090
I'm sure a lot goes into thinking
about making it entertaining.

262
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:05,631
My legs were dying, but they told me
I could sit comfortably.

263
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:09,001
I'm sure that's not actually okay.

264
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:16,908
{\an8}<i>Next time, Toshiya Miyata
works on his passion.</i>

265
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:18,777
{\an8}I love you.

266
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:22,481
{\an8}I can't stop this feeling.

267
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:24,916
{\an8}That's such a waste.

268
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:26,184
{\an8}_I messed it up.

269
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:27,286
{\an8}You forced it.

270
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:28,186
{\an8}Yeah.

271
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:30,055
{\an8}-I know you did.
-You got me.

272
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:34,393
{\an8}<i>Tamamori creates
the costumes for the tour.</i>

273
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:35,294
{\an8}<i>However...</i>

274
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:41,500
{\an8}There's a chance we need to
rethink the shape for Gaya's.

275
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:44,336
{\an8}We may need to do something.

276
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:48,407
{\an8}<i>Tamamori shares his true feelings.</i>

277
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:50,876
{\an8}We need to make it big.

278
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:53,779
{\an8}Or there's no point.

279
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:56,748
{\an8}<i>What is his motivation?</i>
