{\an8}<i>2021.</i>

2
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:14,247
{\an8}<i>JOHNNY'S WEST has completed
a three-month tour.</i>

3
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:18,651
What's that, Haru? Let's check it out.

4
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:20,053
What? Where?

5
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:25,325
<i>This fall, the seven members
are busy with personal projects.</i>

6
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:31,197
<i>They're walking toward their future.</i>

7
00:00:31,264 --> 00:00:33,633
Everything's good experience.

8
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:36,136
{\an8}Let's sing.

9
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:04,597
<i>This is documentary series</i> RIDE ON TIME.

{\an8}2022 CONCERTS MEETING

11
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:08,635
{\an8}<i>September.</i>

12
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:12,338
{\an8}<i>The group is having a meeting about
their important concerts.</i>

13
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,810
This might be the case
and I'm not sure about it yet,

14
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:20,380
{\an8}but the new sets they're making

15
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:24,551
{\an8}may be built so that
we can get closer to the audience.

16
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:27,454
{\an8}No one has used sets like these before.

17
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:33,760
{\an8}Being close to us while we're performing
is one of the audience's real thrills.

18
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:40,233
{\an8}If we can develop our own style for this,
it would be a big draw for us.

19
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,269
{\an8}If all seven of us could do that on stage.

20
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:46,606
{\an8}That's something I'd like to do.

21
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:48,241
{\an8}Something like that.

22
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:51,411
There's still a lot to look forward to.

23
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:56,649
The end of this year is full of
things to think about for 2022.

24
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:58,184
Gotta push a bit further.

25
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:02,222
So viewers, now's the time
to invest in us.

26
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:03,957
Now is the time. Right now.

27
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:05,358
We're heading on up.

28
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:11,364
They'll be like, "We should have
cheered for JOHNNY'S WEST more back then."

29
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:13,466
Don't say that.

30
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:17,871
<i>So says the center of the group, Shigeoka.</i>

31
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:25,011
<i>It was a year filled with big challenges.</i>

32
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:28,281
{\an8}During the performance Shigeoka...

33
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:30,183
{\an8}<i>March of this year.</i>

34
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:33,486
I'll do my best.

35
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,488
I'll really try.

36
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:39,292
{\an8}<i>This rehearsal is for a concert
starting in April</i>

37
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:42,028
{\an8}<i>which celebrates
their seventh anniversary.</i>

38
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:43,663
{\an8}Let's do it again.

39
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:49,435
<i>At this concert, all seven members
will perform solo songs.</i>

40
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:52,772
It went down as I sang.

41
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:58,444
<i>Shigeoka wrote a song
in gratitude of his now-retired father.</i>

42
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,013
"SARARIIMAN NO TOUSAN"

43
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:04,717
He was transferred to Tokyo this April
and was working there alone.

44
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:07,020
Since he's coming back to Hyogo,

45
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:10,023
I thought the timing was right.

46
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:16,663
{\an8}<i>Shigeoka joined the agency in 2006.</i>

47
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:20,967
{\an8}<i>At the time everyone was happy
for him, except his father.</i>

48
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:25,838
My father wasn't really interested
in the entertainment business.

49
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:28,308
He's only been to one of my concerts.

50
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:32,145
My father's the silent type.

51
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,514
He basically lives to work.

52
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:40,954
When it came to family, my mother
was the one who tried hard.

53
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:46,092
Yeah, but my father really did work hard
at his job for us.

54
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:49,128
I'm afraid to get into a fight with him.

55
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:50,029
I see.

56
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:54,167
How should I put this?
I can't disobey him.

57
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:58,137
I wanted to invite him
to a concert in Osaka.

58
00:03:58,204 --> 00:04:01,074
I don't think he knows
what I'm planning for him.

59
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,977
I'm already 28 years old and

60
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:08,081
being a good son seems easy
but it's actually quite hard.

61
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:10,483
That's why I wanted to try this.

62
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:12,885
-Shall we try it?
-What?

63
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:14,621
-Shall we try it?
-Let's do it.

64
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:36,109
{\an8}CONCERT REHEARSAL

65
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:39,512
Shigeoka's a passionate man.

66
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:43,449
{\an8}For a dummy like him
to have created that song,

67
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:45,318
{\an8}I couldn't believe it.

68
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:48,488
{\an8}I told him he'd need a ghostwriter.

69
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:55,461
{\an8}HE'S NOT NUMBER ONE IN THE WORLD
NOR IS HE RICH

70
00:04:55,528 --> 00:05:02,268
{\an8}SUPERMAN CAN'T BEAT HIM
MY SALARYMAN FATHER

71
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:07,607
{\an8}HE HELD ME IN HIS ARMS WHEN I WAS A BABY

72
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:12,612
{\an8}I THINK OF YOU FROM THEN

73
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:16,215
He's the only one who can be
the center of the group.

74
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,687
I think he's a center that rocks.

75
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:25,925
Shigeoka often plays around
with me, Junta or Akito.

76
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:30,330
He only treats Kamiyama differently.
It seems he's still afraid of him.

77
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:33,666
Maybe he still has memories
of Kamiyama's scary side.

78
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:36,402
{\an8}TOMOHIRO KAMIYAMA

79
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:40,573
{\an8}Right now, Shigeoka and I are creating
a lot of songs.

80
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,943
{\an8}The way we create songs
is completely different.

81
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:48,214
I do enjoy the music
that Shigeoka creates.

82
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:51,351
Yeah, I think they're great songs...

83
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:07,467
{\an8}"MACHIGACCHAINAI"
LYRICS AND COMPOSITION: DAIKI SHIGEOKA

84

<i>The concert Shigeoka invited his father to
was to be held in Osaka,</i>

86
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,926
<i>the fourth venue of the tour.</i>

87
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:40,833
{\an8}<i>However, the Osaka performance
had to be canceled.</i>

88
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,001
{\an8}MAY 2-5 PERFORMANCE

89
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:45,004
{\an8}I'm feeling a little bit gloomy about it.

90
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,539
{\an8}I mean...

91
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,174
{\an8}I can't just say,

92
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:51,544
{\an8}"Watch me from the living room.
I'm going to sing now."

93
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:53,646
It has to be done on stage.

94
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:59,252
He's never been interested in my work.
He's only cared about his own.

95
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,421
And then he retires.

96
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:04,824
I think he feels things
differently than me.

97
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:09,328
"Oh, my son's doing this kind of work."

98
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:18,404
Every opportunity is important.

99
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,807
Today's gonna be fun too.

100
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:24,911
<i>He wants to show his father
that he's grown.</i>

101
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:32,385
<i>And this summer, while facing
his feelings about his father,</i>

102
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,487
<i>things take a mysterious turn.</i>

103
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:37,089
{\an8}Good morning.

104
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:39,258
{\an8}Morning. Good morning.

105
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:40,927
{\an8}Good morning.

106
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:47,600
<i>Shigeoka is selected to play the lead role
in a drama on Friday nights at 10 p.m.</i>

107
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:52,638
Congrats.
You're a fully-fledged illustrator now.

108
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:53,773
Not yet.

109
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,609
The fact that it's here
means it's not selling.

110
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:59,245
I'll sell them for you. Leave it to me.

111
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:05,585
<i>It so happens that Shigeoka plays
a father raising his son.</i>

112
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:11,123
Too bad there aren't any grasshoppers.

113
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,492
Do you like them?

114
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:14,694
No?

115
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,929
-I've never seen one.
-You haven't?

116
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:17,830
No way.

117
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:20,032
-I'm not lying.
-Yes you are.

118
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:21,367
You lie!

119
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:23,536
You're lying.

120
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:25,805
<i>This is his first role as a father.</i>

121
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:27,306
Touch it.

122
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:29,909
Don't worry. Pill bugs are harmless.

123
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:38,918
<i>In both his drama and concerts,
he faces the idea of fatherhood.</i>

124
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:44,390
I try to talk with him
even when the cameras aren't rolling.

125
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:48,060
I'm not doing it for the role though.

126
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,996
Haru is just so cute.

127
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:53,399
-You're really like a father.
-Yay! Alright!

128
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:58,304
Haru is really cute.

129
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,773
We catch grasshoppers and take pictures.

130
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:06,145
Your aura's different when you're alone
versus when you're with the group.

131
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:09,615
I'm doing well, right?

132
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:12,184
This is probably how I usually act.

133
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:15,054
{\an8}He's definitely lying.
Why's he lying like that?

134
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:16,322
{\an8}That's scary.

135
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:18,457
{\an8}He says of himself,

136
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:21,761
{\an8}"I'm a lion at home and a mouse abroad."

137
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:25,264
No one reacts to him
so he usually doesn't play stupid.

138
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:27,199
He says he's afraid to.

139
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:30,803
So he behaves wildly in dramas,
especially toward the group.

140
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:35,808
He'll pretend he's stupid
and then fall asleep.

141
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:38,578
I'm sure he's very tired.

142
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:41,581
We just watch over him.

Why don't you just tell
your father you're grateful?

170
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:20,780
I'll be back, you rascal.

171
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:23,783
All right.

172
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:49,975
Here I go.

174
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:01,454
"Dear father,

175
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:04,957
thank you for
your long, hard work as a salaryman."

176
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:10,296
"You are the backbone of the family
and have kept us all happy."

177
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:17,203
"You worked hard as a salaryman,
right up to the very end."

178
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:20,506
"I'm so proud of you for that."

179
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:24,677
"Back in the day, you didn't like singing

180
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:27,279
but I practiced at home anyways."

181
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:29,849
"It must have been noisy."

182
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:33,486
"Thank you for not complaining
and letting me sing."

183
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:38,691
"Thanks to you, singing has become
my purpose in life."

Yeah!

206
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,488
I did it.

207
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,794
I somehow did it without crying.

208
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:57,663
-Fifteen seconds left.
-Huh?

209
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,131
Fifteen seconds.

210
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:00,332
All right.

211
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:07,339
Thank you mom and dad. Thank you!

212
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:10,743
-Thank you everyone!
-See you later!

<i>The curtains have closed on the tour.</i>

214
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,151
I think my family
won't forget about today either.

215
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:22,121
I think he'll always be able to say,

216
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:26,225
"That was a great performance you gave
on Father's Day of 2021."

217
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:30,062
Yeah, I think I was a good son today.

221
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:55,754
This is Hyodo.

222
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:56,655
Don't call me Hyodo.

223
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:58,223
He's my friend.

224
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,926

{\an8}<i>In 2013, when Shigeoka was still a junior,</i>

227
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:11,470
<i>he took over a program
from KanJani8's Murakami as a regular.</i>

228
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:18,143
Right at the time I was set to take over
I was feeling very discouraged.

229
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:22,047
This job saved me
and so I feel truly grateful for it.

230
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:24,216
And I've always felt that way.

00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:35,995
{\an8}Yay!

{\an8}SEPTEMBER
RIATOTSU WEST

235
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:42,301
<i>Their namesake program went
from local to national television.</i>

236
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:45,170
That's too much explaining!

237
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:48,741
I never thought this show
we put so much effort into

238
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:50,409
would go national so quickly...

239
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:51,510
Yeah, I know...

240
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:54,013
It appears on the schedule.

241
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,949
Things like, "You'll get dirty,"
or, "You'll get wet."

242
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:00,052
Isn't this the worst?
"Please bring spare underwear."

243
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:01,420
-Ah.
-Yeah.

244
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:03,188
That was always the case.

245
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:07,993
So one time on the schedule it said,
"You won't get dirty or wet."

246
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,428
Then don't write it.

247
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:11,463
Do other TV programs do that?

248
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:18,203
"Eejanaika!"

249
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:21,273
Yokohama, you're the last show!

250
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:23,909
Let's hit it out of the ballpark!

251
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:25,277
Let's go! Yeah!

252
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:30,916
<i>2014.</i>

253
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:34,219
<i>These seven debuted from Kansai.</i>

254
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:37,956
{\an8}All right!

255

{\an8}ALL SEVEN MEMBERS HAVE FULFILLING

256
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:56,875
{\an8}<i>The winds that have started blowing,
will get stronger over time.</i>

257
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,912
I do wonder what it is that we can do?

258
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:02,881
It is a work of art
that allows us to raise this question.

259
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:05,751
The important lines
and the stimulating lines too.

260
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:11,023
I hope that my acting will be easy
to digest for the audience.

261
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,025
That would be great.

FIRST-TIME STAGE READING

263
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,064
Without actually reading the script,

264
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:22,034
I was acting in some scenes.

265
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,702
That's why it was difficult.

266
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:29,575
I think I'll be able to grow one step
at a time. Like self-expression.

267
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:34,313
{\an8}Thank you, thank you!

00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:48,894
We'll meet again. I'll do my best.

preparing for the 2022 concerts.</i>

273
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:58,437
{\an8}<i>Hitting the ground running.</i>

274
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:04,209
My favorite part is when we're having
concerts together as JOHNNY'S WEST.

275
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:07,880
It's our reason for living.

276
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:12,184
It's where we started.

277
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:15,187
It's what we should be doing.

278
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:19,558
Without our audience,
it's like we don't exist.

279
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:22,928
We want to hit the ground running,
once there's a green light.

280
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:27,199
It's a lively place.

281
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:30,469
It's lively but for us,
it's also somewhere we live.

282
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:33,872
That liveliness lets us
express our talents.

283
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:36,575
It's a place that gives us life
and lets us survive.

284
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:41,813
It's not usually the case that something
would fit so well like these concerts.

285
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,815
I look at everyone during them.

286
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:45,984
It's because of us

287
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:50,155
and this place that we're able to show
our talents and charms.

288
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:52,257
I strongly feel this way.

289
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:57,663
At first, I didn't understand
what Shigeoka would say sometimes.

290
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:59,731
He'd say, "Whaa!"

291
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:02,868
Then I would just laugh
because he was hilarious.

292
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:05,504
Then everybody in the group
would start laughing,

293
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:08,207
and the fans would laugh with us too.

294
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:11,577
We're doing all this
in such a happy atmosphere.

295
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:19,117
I think I know the things that only
JOHNNY'S WEST can do or show.

296
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:23,655
It's just a matter of doing more of it.

297
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,658
I'd love to show that to our audience.

298
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:32,531
I hope they can see it.

299
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:36,468
"JOHNNY'S WEST is awesome."

300
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:37,736
I want them to say that.

301
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:50,148
Hey! Let's have some fun
starting from noon!

302
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:28,453
<i>On the next</i> RIDE ON TIME<i>...</i>

303
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,723
It's better to do it and regret
than regret not doing it.

304
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,926

We do or we don't.

We've made it this far
with all these failures.

311
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:55,947
In the end, I hope people enjoy it though.

312
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:58,684
