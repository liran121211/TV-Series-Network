00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:15,215
{\an8}<i>Shintaro Morimoto, age 24.</i>

2
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:25,658
<i>He's one of the six members
of Johnny's SixTONES.</i>

3
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:31,765
<i>Music was at the center of their career.</i>

4
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:38,071
<i>Each musically talented member
pumps up the crowd with their free spirit.</i>

5
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:40,974
<i>It's one of their charms.</i>

6
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,657
<i>And even amongst the members,</i>

7
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:02,462
<i>the youngest member, Shintaro Morimoto,
is the most free-spirited.</i>

8
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,000
Ouch! You hit me!

9
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,368
I'm singing!

10
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:17,143
Yeah!

11
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,079
{\an8}Okay, we're rolling.

12
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:22,982
{\an8}<i>Even during a TV drama shoot,
he doesn't forget to have fun.</i>

13
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:24,417
{\an8}Action!

14
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:27,620
I'm great at putting the chair in.

15
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:28,855
Do it.

16
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:31,191
-Who?
-Me.

17
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,358
-Do it.
-Okay.

18
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:34,227
-Without looking.
-You're good.

19
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:37,831
-See?
-Wow!

20
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:38,965
Impressive, yeah?

21
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:40,366
Ready, action!

22
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:46,473
Aisaka's <i>shunga</i> still exists
in the present day.

23
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:48,341
But the museum said...

24
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:49,242
Yeah.

25
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:59,319
<i>He's doing some dubbing
for scenes that were already shot.</i>

26
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:01,855
Ready, action!

27
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:06,192
So heavy.

28
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:14,934
I live my life trying to be
the happiest I can be.

29
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:16,870
So...

30
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:21,074
I don't want to hide.

31
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:25,545
I mean, usually when you do interviews,
you don't sit like this on a chair.

32
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,848
I know it's wrong.

33
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:29,883
You do?

34
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:32,819
Of course, I know I shouldn't.

35
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:36,456
But I do it because I want to.

36
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:39,225
It's huge.

37
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,794
This is Toriike!

38
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:45,098
-Yay!
-We're here!

39
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,200
<i>He doesn't lie to himself.</i>

40
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:51,671
<i>His straightforward personality
draws in like-minded friends.</i>

41
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:52,906
Wow.

42
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:55,508
This is probably another world.

43
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:58,178
Somewhere I've never been before.

44
00:02:58,244 --> 00:02:59,312
Let's take a look.

45
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:20,233
<i>He's taken to an underwater cave.</i>

46
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:33,446
<i>His natural self</i>

47
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:38,351
<i>was hungry for a moment of excitement
from the bottom of his heart.</i>

48
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,127
Wow.

49
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:49,062
Amazing.

50
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:54,901
So amazing!

51
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:21,361
<i>This is documentary series</i> Ride on Time.

52
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:27,800
{\an8}<i>Preparation began for their
New Year's concert tour.</i>

53
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:30,236
{\an8}Let's start.

54
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:33,006
{\an8}Okay, let's start our first meeting.

55
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:36,542
{\an8}Let's do it.

56
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,211
You have some ideas?

57
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,446
Something cool.

58
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:42,215
Something flashy.

59
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,719
We used lots of lights for our last one.

60
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:50,256
So let's do something else.

61
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:53,359
{\an8}<i>All of their concerts</i>

62
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:56,362
{\an8}<i>began with their idea proposals.</i>

63
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:01,901
{\an8}<i>What they seek is unpredictability,
to surprise the audience.</i>

64
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:07,640
{\an8}2021 COUNTRYWIDE ARENA TOUR

65
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:12,245
You know like how
we had the slide for <i>on eST.</i>

66
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:16,149
Something to put
the center stage in new light.

67
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:19,419
Could we get cars to
transport us from each stage?

68
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,753
Something surprising.

69
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,922
Like the monitor becoming a stage.

70
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,157
And then it moves.

71
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:27,293
The main stage splits in two.

72
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,862
Wouldn't they see backstage?

73
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:31,631
They'd see backstage.

74
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:33,266
What will our crew do?

75
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:38,404
What if it splits
and another stage appears?

76
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:42,108
We'll make it a medium-sized
main stage to start,

77
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,811
then it splits, and another appears.

78
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:48,381
-Making it big.
-A big main stage!

79
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:50,850
They might question the main stage.

80
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:56,022
Until the main stage.

81
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:58,458
I haven't written any of this down.

82
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,661
I thought about it, but haven't.

83
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,799
{\an8}<i>Jesse, age 25.</i>

84
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,801
{\an8}This is cool too.

85
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:11,170
Beautiful.

86
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:16,142
{\an8}Fans would send us letters every month.

87
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,212
{\an8}Mentioning which pictures they liked.

88
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:24,417
That was me.

89
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:32,091
<i>He has a unique presence,
even amongst the other Johnny's members.</i>

90
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:34,627
{\an8}JOHNNY'S COUNTDOWN 2021 TO 2022

91
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:38,798
{\an8}<i>The countdown concert where
Johnny's idols all perform at once.</i>

92
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:40,433
SixTONES!

93
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:53,646
We're going to give this year our all.

94
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:55,314
Cross, cross, circle, circle.

95
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:58,117
Maru, Maru, Maru.

96
00:06:58,184 --> 00:06:59,519
-Jesse!
-Maru!

97
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:00,586
That's enough.

98
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:02,054
Okay, cut it out.

99
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:05,425
<i>He's not timid around his seniors.</i>

100
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:10,129
<i>However, he is particular
about the way he presents himself.</i>

101
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:17,103
I like that <i>Safari</i> doesn't
list who they feature on the cover,

102
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:20,173
unlike the other magazines.

103
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:23,743
They're not promoting the models.

104
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,311
Like so and so.

105
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:28,815
When readers thumb through it,
they realize that I'm in it.

106
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:29,949
That's what I like.

107
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,152
I'm doing this in secret.

108
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,723
This is like my secret spot
nobody knows about.

109
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:41,594
What about secretly doing radio?

110
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:44,363
Yeah, without using my name.

111
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,134
"Welcome to another Friday."

112
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:50,903
"Another day of fun radio."

113
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,605
"That sounds like Jesse."

114
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,740
But I never say my name.

115
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,375
I want to do that.

116
00:07:57,109 --> 00:07:58,511
Without being found out.

117
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,251
<i>What's important is that
they see him for who he is.</i>

118
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:13,493
The most important thing
is to have as many people

119
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:17,296
think that I'm cool.

120
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:20,333
People I know
always tell me how cool I am,

121
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:22,134
and that makes me happy.

122
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:26,038
It makes me want to show more of myself.

123
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:28,574
-Really?
-Yeah.

124
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:32,211
We want people to come.
That's our real job.

125
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:38,017
I need people to know that
that's the real me.

126
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:41,954
Make them realize what I do.

127
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,256
Yeah.

128
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:16,389
<i>Passion for concert shows.</i>

129
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:21,360
<i>And another new song has been completed.</i>

130
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:28,668
{\an8}<i>Choreography for Jesse
and Shintaro Morimoto's song</i>

131
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:32,138
{\an8}<i>is being handled
by world champion dancers.</i>

132
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:34,540
So the steps for the chorus...

133
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:37,510
<i>They must have the steps
perfectly memorized</i>

134
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,979
<i>for the music video shoot in a week.</i>

135
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:46,786
Then.

136
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:53,459
It's a bit fast.

137
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,827
Then.

138
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:03,302
-And this...
-Wow, Jesse.

139
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:05,304
Don't put pressure on me.

140
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:06,973
I'm just doing it now.

141
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:09,508
I forget as fast as I learn.

142
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:16,315
<i>They cherish their unity
with the crowd above all else.</i>

143
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,586
<i>More than precise choreography,</i>

144
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:23,789
<i>they each push
to showcase their individualism.</i>

145
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:30,429
<i>The dance that incorporates
the new jack swing from the '80s</i>

146
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:34,433
<i>is intense and also has a rhythm
that is difficult to grasp.</i>

147
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,868
Let's go from the top.

148
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:38,170
I haven't moved this much in a while.

149
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,240
It's intense.

150
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:46,078
Then up we go.

151
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,748
Switch!

152
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:55,054
Then to the back.

153
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,891
I can't do that.

154
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,527
My body can't keep up.

155
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,329
Put the music on.

156
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:04,563
Yeah.

157
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:38,964
This is so hard.

158
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:48,674
I'm impressed by how they
learn the steps and express themselves.

159
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:52,678
They're really professional
when it comes to looking cool.

160
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:54,013
They've got the feel.

161
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,649
It's not just their movements.

162
00:11:56,716 --> 00:12:01,053
I feel that from SixTONES as a group.

163
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,324
If they're able to
turn it into entertainment,

164
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,527
things will become very interesting.

165
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:10,963

So we'd like to give them
a nice send-off with this big hit.

179
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,834
V6's "Take me Higher."

180
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:28,040
{\an8}<i>They played a popular hit by their seniors
who finished their final show.</i>

181
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:29,575
{\an8}V6 LAST CONCERT 2021

182
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,943
Did you go to their show?

183
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,845
What? V? Yeah.

184
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,113
Want to talk about it?

185
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:38,017
Honestly, I cried looking at the stage.

186
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:42,121
You just figure they'd be around forever.

187
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:43,055
I get it.

188
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:44,757
You know...

189
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:48,761
you can't imagine this group being gone.

190
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,296
I totally get it.

191
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:53,833
The people above are disappearing.

192
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:59,071
There were tons of people
who admired them.

193
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,945
How long will SixTONES be around?

194
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:11,183
Hm... Maybe until we reach the age
that government workers retire.

195
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,018
That's hilarious.

196
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:14,820
Until retirement.

197
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:16,555
I'll probably retire first.

198
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:19,258
-Since I'm the oldest.
-I see.

199
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:28,200
<i>As time passes, what view awaits them
in the future they arrive at?</i>

200
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,035
Man.

201
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,239
It feels good.

202
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:46,352
<i>He spends his days off away from
the competitive entertainment business.</i>

203
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:49,321
Thanks so much.

204
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,223
Oof.

205
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,960
{\an8}YUGO KOCHI

206
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,698
Looking good.

207
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:04,403
<i>Before SixTONES was formed,</i>

208
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:07,439
<i>Kochi was planning
to leave the idol world.</i>

209
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:18,017
So hot.

210
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:31,497
How should I put this?
As I've said before,

211
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:37,202
I wasn't a someone who was
aggressive about being in entertainment.

212
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:41,407
I just had seniors doing it.

213
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:44,777
People like V6.

214
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:47,313
People who I thought
would always be there.

215
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:49,548
Then they suddenly left.

216
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,684
It makes me sad,

217
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,620
but when I saw their last show,

218
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:59,692
I thought it was
a really cool way to disband.

219
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:02,494
How much they cared about the fans.

220
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:07,266
They took a stand and made it through.

221
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:11,337
I understood that
they lived their idol life to the end.

222
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:15,474
They're great role-models
on how I want to be.

223
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,609
So,

224
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:24,717
I'm sure that there's still room
to grow at that age,

225
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:28,954
so I felt that I have to work harder.

226
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,593
-You're reading off that?
-Yeah.

227
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,796
<i>He chose to go on with SixTONES.</i>

228
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:43,535
<i>He's working hard
to polish his skills for the group.</i>

229
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:46,538
That's so hi-tech.

230
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:49,608
Really? You can't delete
what you've written?

231
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,243
-No, you can.
-Really?

232
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:08,227
{\an8}"MAKKA NA USO"

233
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:18,504
Yeah, that's much better.

234
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:25,177
-So...
-Too much emphasis?

235
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:28,313
So, it sounds like you're going lower.

236
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,548
Oh.

237
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:35,954
"Why" should be... How do I put this?

238
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:38,257
Try not to throw too hard.

239
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:43,629
Yeah, don't do that.

240
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:47,666
Try that melody.

241
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:54,473
Like this.

242
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:57,609
That's low.

243
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:58,677
-Something like that.
-That's low.

244
00:17:58,744 --> 00:17:59,578
Yeah.

245
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:04,850
Yeah, good.

246
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:07,886
Yeah.

247
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:11,924
Yeah.

248
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:17,196
Let me do that again.

249
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:43,555
-You did it.
-Good, good.

250
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:44,490
Let's hear it.

251
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:46,925
Do you go for lessons?

252
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:50,062
Yeah, although I'm not sure
I'd call it lessons.

253
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,430
We get worked.

254
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:54,299
My body feels worked.

255
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:55,767
-With a whip?
-Yeah.

256
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:56,969
I see.

257
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:59,471
I have to do it.
They follow me around.

258
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:03,275
But it really helps me.

259
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,321
It's fine.

260
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:20,058
<i>The six members
live and think differently.</i>

261
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,796
<i>They've pit their individuality
against one another,</i>

262
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:27,799
<i>to create their own style.</i>

263
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:29,535
-I'll do the neck.
-That'd hurt.

264
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:35,274
<i>That's a compromise they're
not willing to make creatively.</i>

265
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:43,882
Let's go again.

266
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:51,256
<i>He had an issue with
a part the staff gave him.</i>

267
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:54,493
Shouldn't you give this all
to Juri instead?

268
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,863
-It'd be better if Juri did this himself.
-I see.

269
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:01,567
That will really cut your part down.

270
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:03,635
That's fine with me.

271
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:07,873
It's not about who gets more.
It's better to do what's better.

272
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,575
Juri is the better rapper.

273
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:10,876
You think?

274
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:12,744
What about going back and forth?

275
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:15,480
Like having two MCs to hype each other.

276
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:18,317
It's exciting to hear as a listener.

277
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,986
So it could be really effective.

278
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,522
Let's record it for now.

279
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:26,725
-We'll do some combinations.
-Yeah, that works.

280
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:28,293
-That's the gist.
-Got it.

281
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,895
-Bye.
-Thanks.

282
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:31,663
Good work, everyone. Thanks.

283
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,931
Good work.

284
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:48,447
I can't hide my emotions.

285
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:52,484
If I don't think it's fun,
it shows on my face.

286
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:55,187
If I don't like it,
it shows on my face.

287
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:59,057
I'm really bad when that happens.

288
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:03,528
I don't care as long as I'm having fun.

289
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:08,367
What I tend to think is fun...

290
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:11,003
the other five are good at utilizing.

291
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:13,405
That's why I think

292
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:16,508
I have so much fun being
a member of SixTONES.

293
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:20,245
Because I have a place to return to,
I'm able to live so freely.

294
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:25,117
That's why I can do so much.

295
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:29,087
That's something I don't want to forget.

296
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:34,159
I think that's why it's fun,
and why we really trust each other.

297
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:44,036
{\an8}<i>Next time, recording
for the album ramps up.</i>

298
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:55,180
{\an8}I'm envious of Taiga.

299
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:57,316
{\an8}I can't hit high notes.

300
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:58,750
{\an8}But from my perspective,

301
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:03,889
{\an8}Jesse can do things I can't
like sing in English and hit low notes.

302
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:11,296
{\an8}<i>What are the emotions
behind their singing?</i>
