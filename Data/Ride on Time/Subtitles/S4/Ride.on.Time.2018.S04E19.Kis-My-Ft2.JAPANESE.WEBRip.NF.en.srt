{\an8}<i>Johnny's countdown concert.</i>

00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:23,656
{\an8}<i>Kis-My-Ft2, or Kis-My for short.</i>

{\an8}<i>What does 2022 mean to him?</i>

10
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,140
The 10th anniversary of our debut,

11
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:43,176
be it our fans,

12
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:49,049
or the people who helped support Kis-My.

13
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:54,721
Of course I feel grateful
and want to give back to all of them,

14
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:59,025
but I also want us
to be even more popular.

15
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:02,195
I've always felt that.

16
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:04,964
We need to make it big.

17
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,634
Or there's no point.

18
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,105
<i>What is his motivation?</i>

00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,631

{\an8}<i>Their first concert in three years

22
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:51,744
<i>Yuta Tamamori is in charge
of Kis-My's costumes.</i>

23
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:56,483
<i>On this day, the costume design sketches
were brought out.</i>

SENGA

25
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:00,720
This patchwork makes it more elegant.

26
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:04,657
This may be a little more pop,
but I want something more elegant.

27
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:10,296
There's a chance we need to
rethink the shape for Gaya's.

28
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:12,966
We may need to do something.

{\an8}<i>Tamamori has been in charge of costumes
for many of their concerts.</i>

<i>He's currently thinking
about Fujigaya's costume.</i>

32
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:41,494
<i>Only one of them would be wearing
a long coat over their jacket.</i>

33
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:43,897
FUJIGAYA

34
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:45,598
With this kind of style,

35
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:52,639
you really need to... make the line right.

36
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:55,475
I don't want it looking too baggy.

37
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:02,448
<i>What are Tamamori's feelings
towards the costumes?</i>

38
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:10,990
I try to make them look cool.

39
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:17,864
I want the seven of us
to be a fashion statement.

40
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:21,301
Johnny's costumes leave
a strong impression.

41
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,836
They have a distinct brand.

42
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,873
Being sparkly or frilly.

43
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,043
That's of course mainstream and wonderful,

44
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:34,113
but I want to go in
a more fashionable direction.

45
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,684
Something that makes
Kis-My look more sophisticated.

46
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:42,021
Something that looks cool
and motivates us.

47
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:45,658
I strive to make costumes
that will make people think,

48
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,295
"Wow, that costume is so cool."

49
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:52,999
That's the kind of costumes I try to make.

50
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:58,304
Everyone gets in position at the intro.

51
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:01,274
<i>Rehearsals that go into
the tiniest details.</i>

52

I'm forgetting what I memorized.

56
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:32,772
What's wrong with me?

57
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,909
-I'll get it done by the 8th.
-By the 8th?

58
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:41,180
Like doing your homework
the last day of vacation?

59
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:42,882
Is that bad?

60
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,618
<i>He always lightens the mood like so.</i>

61
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:48,788
Because I'm a detective.

62
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,825
<i>He cut his hair short
for his role in a TV drama.</i>

63
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:55,895
That's right. It starts in January.

64
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:02,602
They said my bangs shouldn't
reach my eyebrows so I cut it.

65
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:08,207
I guess it'll be short
for the concert too.

66
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:10,243
-Really?
-Is it weird?

67
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,144
It suits you.

68
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,712
That's nice to hear.

69
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:16,449
I've got a pretty face
so it's only natural.

70
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:21,254
<i>Miyata is making headway
into new territory in his solo career.</i>

71
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,755
I'm so pretty.

72

Take this!

77
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:49,649
Wait, you're...

78
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:51,984
Abby's a friend.

79
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:55,288
I feel like I've desperately...

80
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:59,592
held on these last ten years.

81
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:04,564
I had no confidence, and was so timid.

82
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:06,899
Of course I'd get messed with.

83
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,370
I've totally changed.

84
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:16,008

87
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,850

<i>looking up to him as a teacher.</i>

92
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,433
I'm going to have you read

93
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:46,272
as a hero, a main character
in a romance, and a mascot character.

94
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:48,474
-Which one first?
-Let me think.

95
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:53,246
I'd like to do the romantic lead.

96
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:56,349
You really love those parts.

97
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,384
I do.

98
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:02,088
There's pattern A and B.
Which do you want?

99
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:03,823
I like B.

100
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:04,924
I see.

101
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:06,159
Okay.

102
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:09,462
-We'll do pattern B.
-Okay.

103
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:11,030
So punctuation marks.

104
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,932
Like periods, and commas.

105
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:19,205
I always wonder about
how much I should be adhering to them.

106
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,441
As you're talking to me now,

107
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:23,943
are you thinking about punctuation?

108
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,144
No.

109
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:28,881
-You aren't imagining punctuation, right?
-That's true.

110
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,818
So don't think about punctuation marks.

111
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:36,522
You can just forget about them
as a concept altogether.

112
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:39,158
Why don't you go ahead.
Picture it in your mind.

113
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:40,693
Okay.

114
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:42,862
"I love you.

115
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:45,798
I can't stop this feeling.

116
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,569
No matter what view lies ahead of us,

117
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:54,874
as long as I'm with you,
I'll be able to admire it with a smile.

118
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,678
Now, take my hand.

119
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:00,813
Let's go take in this view together."

120
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,848
Okay, thank you.

121
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:06,519
First off, what kind of character is he?

122
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:10,890
What I imagined was someone 21 years old,

123
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:15,127
who I'm sure wanted to
take her to a bridge

124
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:20,233
to admire the night skyline
together or something.

125
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:25,771
First, I want to say
that you're not in that scene.

126
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,273
From that performance.

127
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,842
You have to become this character,

128
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:35,581
so you can't be looking
into the scene from the outside.

129
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:38,284
-Right.
-I think you're not sure.

130
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:43,823
About whether you're looking at
the mountain, river, or the heroine.

131
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,859
You haven't settled on
what you're viewing.

132
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:51,797
It's about a guy who is
not able to stop his own feelings.

133
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:52,965
Right.

134
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:56,102
"I love you.

135
00:08:57,169 --> 00:09:01,541
I can't stop this feeling."

136
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:02,909
"I love you."

137
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,444
"I love you."

138
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,480
"I love you."

139
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,115
"I love you."

140
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:11,751
You say "I love you" to her.

141
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:14,587
<i>He repeated this line for 40 minutes.</i>

142
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:17,523

No matter what view lies ahead of us,

145
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:29,769

148
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:40,112
Yes, nice!

149
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:42,615
I can picture the scene.

150
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:44,884
-I'm happy.
-That's great.

151
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:47,253

<i>As a fan of anime,</i>

153
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:52,224

00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:55,094
<i>But when he first debuted...</i>

155
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:57,597
"I'll burn you all!"

156
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:04,337
Society just associated anime culture
with being gross and creepy.

157
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:07,139
But I thought it was worse

158
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:13,312
to say I didn't like it because of that.

159
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:23,656
<i>Miyata was struggling having to
hide himself, until...</i>

160
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:29,328
When we were doing a Kis-My concert,

161
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:31,931
I said I wanted to do <i>otagei</i>.

162
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:36,869
<i>Otagei</i> is that cheer dance
done by geeky fans.

163
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:41,073
I think everyone knows what it is now
but back then people were like,

164
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:47,413
"Is that cool? Is that even fun?"
Some people didn't view it positively.

165
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,816
But the other members were on board.

166
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:55,821
Their attitude was,
"Sounds cool, let's do it."

I feel that working hard

00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:36,629
is something that will eventually
connect back to the group.

173
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:41,767
Like an anime created by
Kis-My's Toshiya Miyata.

174
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:44,837
Doesn't that sound good?

175
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:47,907
And the title song would be by Kis-My-Ft2.

176
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:50,643
That'd be great.

177
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:58,918
Welcome.

178
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:03,355
{\an8}<i>Nikaido is in charge
of the tour's production.</i>

179
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:05,391
{\an8}<i>He shares his thoughts on Kis-My.</i>

180
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:06,659
{\an8}TAKASHI NIKAIDO

181
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:10,696
Well, I love... I love it, I guess.

182
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:14,400
I love it very much, but...

183
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:19,038
It might not look like
we get along from the outside.

184
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:22,708
It's not that we don't get along.

185
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:27,747
I think we just don't want to
act like we get along for appearances.

186
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:35,287
<i>When Nikaido works on production,
there's something he keeps in mind.</i>

187
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:39,492
When I'm coming up with ideas,

188
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,763
I'm not in Kis-My anymore.

189
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,065
I become a fan.

190
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:51,504
I think about what fans want to see
and what would make them happy.

191
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:54,707
Something that will make them feel great.

192
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:01,680
I become a different person.

193
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:06,385
That's why I probably lose my spotlight.

194
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:12,124
{\an8}<i>With such thoughts
going into the concerts...</i>

195
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:17,229
{\an8}MAY 2021 METLIFE DOME
LIVE TOUR 2021 HOME (LIVESTREAM)

196
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:23,536
{\an8}<i>The waterworks they showed off
during their 2021 live stream</i>

197
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:25,871
{\an8}<i>became a big talking point among fans.</i>

198
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:33,579
<i>Also, there is always someone on his mind.</i>

199
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:37,716
Every year when we do a show,

200
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:42,721
I always wonder what Mr. Johnny would do.

201
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,726
I wonder if we're
meeting his expectations.

202
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:53,332
"Are you guys giving
the audience a good time?"

203
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,569
That's what I imagine him asking us.

204
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:09,081
This could be the time
when I think about him the most.

205
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:22,061
<i>The Kis-My-Ft2 member
with a unique character.</i>

206
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:25,965
{\an8}<i>Wataru Yokoo.</i>

207
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:33,372
{\an8}<i>He's a first-class tuna butcher
while also an idol.</i>

208
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:34,273
{\an8}TUNA BUTCHER

209
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:39,812
{\an8}<i>He has many other qualifications,
such as that of a pet carer.</i>

210
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:40,946
{\an8}PET CARER

211
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:45,117
<i>One day during rehearsal...</i>

212
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:46,318
The timing.

213
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,487
Yeah, we can do that.

214
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:51,423
-Can we change it, Nika?
-What?

215
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:55,494
Kitayama will hang back talking,

216
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:59,198
but if he wants more time
between songs, I can stay back.

217
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:00,666
-Sure, that's fine.
-Okay?

218
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,001
-Totally.
-Thanks.

219
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,803
<i>Even during a break...</i>

220
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,440
Nika, for "FIRE BEAT"...

221
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:12,811
Right now, Mr. Kitayama is in the center.

222
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:18,751
What if we move him over there,
and everyone else gathers around him?

223
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:21,687
-No problem.
-That might be better.

224
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,222
Shall we do that?

225
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,026
<i>He is always looking
at the bigger picture.</i>

226
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,865
<i>The root of this trait
can be found at the book store.</i>

227
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,268
If this were for business,

228
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:42,107
I would try to imagine how
Kis-My should position itself,

229
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:45,210
or how we should conduct ourselves.

230
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:48,914
Tamamori handles our costumes.

231
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:54,653
Miyata is on merchandising,
and Nika's handling production.

232
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,889
And Mr. Senga works on choreography.

233
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,525
There are four divisions.

234
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:02,561
What can we do to keep that flow going?

235
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:07,433
That's something great businesses
have figured out already.

236
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,136
You can learn a lot from their examples.

237
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:17,476
<i>Their 10-year anniversary
is giving Yokoo certain misgivings.</i>

238
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:20,779
Until how old are you an idol?

239
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:22,815
How long can you do it?

240
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:25,751
We're all in our 30s now.

241
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:29,788
Can we carry on until our 50s
like some of our predecessors?

242
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:31,857
So 20 more years.

243
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:34,293
Or...

244
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:39,398
it could be 10 if we stumble.

245
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:46,105
<i>Every member of Kis-My-Ft2
is in their 30s now.</i>

246
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:53,612
<i>What's something Yokoo keeps in mind
for them to continue their idol careers?</i>

247
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:57,916
It's important to think
and act for yourself.

248
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,587
You can't just be told
what to do, being a puppet.

249
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:08,627
When that person disappears,
you won't be able to do anything anymore.

250
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,829
We need to...

251
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:15,601
be able move on our own
to a certain degree.

252
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:19,505
<i>Yokoo recently started</i>

253
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:20,639
MORE VEGETABLES IN PASTA AND SOUP

254
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,841
<i>writing for a cooking magazine.</i>

255
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:29,281
<i>The food-loving Yokoo
found a new path for himself.</i>

256
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:34,153
<i>Think and act for yourself.</i>

257
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:36,088
<i>That's Kis-My.</i>

258
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:38,924
KIS-MY-FT2 WATARU YOKOO'S
WATARU MEAL FOR YOU

259
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:40,626
{\an8}DECEMBER 31, 2021

260
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:44,463
{\an8}<i>The tumultuous year
that was 2021 was ending.</i>

261
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:48,667
{\an8}DECEMBER 31, 2021

262
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,937
{\an8}Three, two, one.

263
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:54,673
{\an8}Happy New Year!

264
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,876
{\an8}-It's 2022!
-Happy New Year!

265
00:17:57,943 --> 00:18:00,579
{\an8}<i>The Johnny's Countdown Concert.</i>

266
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,849
{\an8}<i>It returned to Tokyo Dome
after a two year hiatus.</i>

267
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,618
Three, two, one, go! Come on!

268
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:08,720
<i>Of course, Kis-My was there too.</i>

269
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:28,607
<i>After the Countdown concert ended,</i>

270
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,944
<i>Tamamori shared his current feelings.</i>

271
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:35,180
Having fans who've...

272
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:40,152
been supporting us continuously
without changing for ten years

273
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:43,956
is really significant.

274
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:48,527
After all, normally...

275
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:54,299
concerts are the only opportunities
we have to meet our fans.

276
00:18:54,366 --> 00:19:00,005
We haven't had that in about two years.

277
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:04,776
So we've been wanting to
show them our cheerful selves,

278
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:06,879
that's what we've been thinking.

279
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:12,417
What time is it? Almost 2:00 a.m.?

280
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:16,021
There's only 12 months left.

281
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:23,295
Only 12 months left, it's too soon.

282
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:24,930
It'll be over in a flash.

283
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:29,835
I don't know what it is,
but I'm in a rush to live.

284
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,471
I'm always in a hurry.

285
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:33,672
Really?

286
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:38,076
Of course, I feel pressured since
so many talented kids are coming up.

287
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:39,945
Right?

288
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:44,449
If you take it easy, they'll pass you by.

289
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,824
<i>And...</i>

290
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,363
We need to make it big.

291
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:01,099
Or there's no point.

292
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:06,171
What do you mean?

293
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:09,041
I'm not sure if I should be saying this,

294
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:11,210
but I mean, what's the point then?

295
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:13,145
We're doing this to be popular.

296
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,980
And for the fans.

297
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:20,052
I mean, it's for ourselves and Kis-My too.

298
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:24,289
But since we're doing it,
we should be make it big.

299
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:27,526
I feel strongly about that.

300
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:30,295
As long as we're in this game,

301
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:34,800
we need to be striving for the top.

302
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:45,510
we need to be an even stronger group.

303
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:48,981
That's how I see it.

304
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:56,154
<i>And so began 2022,</i>

305
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:59,558
<i>the year of resolutions.</i>

306
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:05,797
<i>Next time, the arena tour is closing in.</i>

307
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,103
<i>Fujigaya continues to struggle.</i>

308
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:17,075
I wondered what I'd think
after ten years had passed.

309
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:19,578
Like, I've learned how to do this or that.

310
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:22,748
But I haven't learned
to do anything at all.

311
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:25,817
{\an8}<i>And he visits a special someone.</i>

312
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:27,586
{\an8}What?

313
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:29,221
{\an8}Ms. Ishida?

314
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,622
{\an8}Taichan?

315
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:36,495
{\an8}<i>The final rehearsal for the arena tour.</i>

316
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:38,096
{\an8}Three, four.

317
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:40,198
{\an8}Five, six, seven, eight.

318
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:43,635
{\an8}When they think we disappeared,
we just kind of slink in.

319
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:47,239
{\an8}So when the video turns off,
we shouldn't stand?

320
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:53,011
{\an8}Off we go!

321
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,214
{\an8}-Let's go!
-Yeah!

322
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:57,115
{\an8}Let's do it.

323
