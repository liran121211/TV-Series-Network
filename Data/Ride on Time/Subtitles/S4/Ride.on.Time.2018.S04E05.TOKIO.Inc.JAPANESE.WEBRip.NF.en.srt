1
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:03,636
-Here we go.
-We're rolling.

2
00:00:05,238 --> 00:00:08,375
<i>Spring 2021.</i>

3
00:00:08,908 --> 00:00:12,612
<i>The group's walking a new path.</i>

4
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:21,688
{\an8}<i>For the past 27 years, they've existed
as the idol group TOKIO.</i>

5
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:23,990
{\an8}<i>And today, all three are in suits.</i>

6
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:29,462
Let him take one picture
sitting like a president.

7
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:30,964
-Okay.
-On the chair?

8
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:35,668
-That's unexpected...
-Yeah.

9
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:38,438
This is unexpectedly fitting.

10
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,108
-Yeah...
-I agree.

11
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:47,180
<i>This trio is walking a new path.</i>

12
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:52,152
{\an8}<i>And it is TOKIO Inc.</i>

13
00:00:55,455 --> 00:01:02,429
{\an8}<i>TOKIO originally consisted
of three members when formed in 1990.</i>

14
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:07,300
{\an8}<i>They debuted their first CD
four years later.</i>

15
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:10,470
{\an8}<i>They had an unusual rock band style.</i>

16
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:17,777
<i>The wild idol group
would sometimes remove clothing on stage.</i>

17
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,517
{\an8}<i>Having gotten older,
they've chosen another wild path</i>

18
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:28,755
{\an8}<i>of creating their own company this year.</i>

19
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:31,291
{\an8}2021
TOKIO INC. STARTED

20
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:36,062
There was some change. That's why
we decided to establish our own company.

21
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:41,601
If we don't enjoy those changes,
time will pass us by

22
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:45,405
and things will end on a vague note.

23
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:49,342
Landscapes I haven't seen.

24
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:54,047
Yeah, that's something I want to see.

25
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:57,317
I had my title sewed on.

26
00:01:57,383 --> 00:01:58,451
It's a secret.

27
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:00,086
PRESIDENT

28
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:04,624
I went to a local tailor myself
and got it done.

29
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:06,793
I made the reservation,
and the shopkeeper said,

30
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,596
"he's actually here!"
and was all surprised.

31
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:10,597
{\an8}APRIL 1, 2021

32
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:17,103
{\an8}<i>The three members started their company,
announcing it in the Nikkei.</i>

33
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:21,307
<i>Sweat.</i>

34
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:23,176
<i>Work.</i>

35
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:25,178
<i>Experience.</i>

36
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:27,747
<i>This is the company's motto.</i>

37
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:31,384
I'm TOKIO Inc.'s president, Joshima.

38
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:32,952
Thank you for your card.

39
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:34,454
My name is Matsuoka.

40
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:36,256
Pleased to meet you.

41
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,725
If you get cold, you can burn my card.

42
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:41,661
It's not a piece of firewood...

43
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:45,131
<i>What kind of company will this be?</i>

44
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:11,991
<i>This is documentary series</i> RIDE ON TIME.

45
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:14,761
TOKIO INC. BEGINS NOW.

46

{\an8}<i>The three are in talks at the moment.</i>

49
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:25,071
{\an8}TAICHI, SHIGERU, MASAHIRO

50
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:30,610
The main agenda for today is
to see if Matsuoka can use Zoom.

51
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:32,879
Yes, I heard.

52
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:35,715
Yeah, I don't know
so I'll leave it up to you.

53
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:38,918
But you can't just ask a manager.
Do it yourself.

54
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:41,154
I don't know how to approach this.

55
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,589
-Including that.
-Exactly.

56
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:44,657
The Zoom application.

57
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:46,192
Zoom app?

58
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:49,729
Is that app on this thing?
I just gotta search for it, right?

59
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:51,531
-Yeah.
-Okay.

60
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:52,432
Zoom.

61
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,368
-Wow.
-Here it is.

62
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:56,402
You okay?

63
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:57,937
The password...

64
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,607
What's the password?

65
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:02,442
Just a moment.

66
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:03,443
Open.

67
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:05,645
I'll take a picture now.

68
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:07,180
Here we go.

69
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:11,951
This is my first time doing a video call.

70
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:13,953
You're so Showa.

71
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,223
-It's amazing that you can do this.
-It is amazing.

72
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,460
-Sorry, please look here.
-Yeah, go ahead.

73
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:21,527

74
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,596
{\an8}<i>Pictures for the homepage.</i>

75
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:25,898
{\an8}<i>The members take pictures themselves.</i>

76
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:28,835
{\an8}-We can relax doing it.
-Yeah.

77
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:34,507
-I think these are really good.
-That's too close.

78
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:35,408
Oh, it is good...

79
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,543
-See? I told you so.
-Yeah, yeah...

80
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,012
It's good. I like it.

81
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:40,246
-Right?
-Yeah.

82
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:41,581
It's good.

83
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:46,986
{\an8}<i>The president is the leader of the group,
Shigeru Joshima.</i>

84
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:52,759
{\an8}<i>He's quiet and receptive to others,
with a gentle personality.</i>

85
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:57,964
{\an8}<i>Taichi Kokubun.</i>

{\an8}<i>Full of ideas,
he proposes various projects.</i>

88
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:07,240
{\an8}Hold on. Move back a bit.

89
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,777
{\an8}<i>And the youngest, Masahiro Matsuoka.</i>

90
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:13,379
{\an8}<i>Vice president in charge of PR.</i>

91
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:17,650
{\an8}<i>Known for his mischievousness,
he's actually sensitive.</i>

92
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:22,155
<i>He's an indispensable member that
aligns the group on the same wavelength.</i>

93
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:28,695
For this shoot, I wanted to take pictures
without exerting ourselves.

94
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:32,398
The promotional photos
we've taken before were too perfect.

95
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:33,900
I'm tired of those.

96
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:36,536
We don't need to overedit these.

97
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:38,304
This is just fine.

98
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,674
-Is it blinking?
-It is.

99
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:43,109
Is it? I can't see it.

100
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:48,781
<i>They all remain particular with their work
all the way through to completion.</i>

101
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:51,784
-Did it take?
-There it goes.

102
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,087

{\an8}MARCH

107
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,733
{\an8}<i>They've set out to create business cards</i>

108
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:11,871
{\an8}<i>in Fukushima, a place they've grown close
to through years of television filming.</i>

109
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:22,248
<i>The group cuts down the trees themselves.</i>

110
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,019
That's great.

111
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:28,755
-Come on!
-Hey!

112
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:30,022
How was that?

113
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:31,958
Hey!

114
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:33,126
It's not falling.

115
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:34,961
-Fall over!
-It's not.

116
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:40,166
Trees are alive too, you know?
It's like, "It'll take more than that."

117
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,802
Guys, running a company is the same thing.

118
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:46,272
It's not that easy.

119
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:50,877
Come on down!

120
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:52,211
Go!

121
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:02,688
-It fell over!
-You did it!

122
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,525
It's amazing. Trees are amazing.

123
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:08,528
-It was very resilient.
-What an amazing tree.

124
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,129
It's a good tree.

125
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:16,469
<i>The back of the business card
has an engraving of TOKIO Inc.'s logo.</i>

126
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,939
<i>Kokubun designed it himself.</i>

127
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:26,612
By doing things with our own hands,

128
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:29,882
I believe it has given us confidence.

129
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:33,953
A sense of completion and pride.

130
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:38,124
By having more of these feelings,

131
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:42,128
I strongly believe
we've given ourselves more confidence.

132
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:47,567
I hope that people out there
appreciate and acknowledge

133
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:51,704
our originality,
the things that are unique to us.

134
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:54,273
It's a kind of warmth.

135
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:58,344
It's a kind of memory.

136
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,546
A sign that the tree was alive.

137
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:03,549
I wonder what we'll leave behind,
what we'll make.

138
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:05,485
There's a level of anticipation.

139
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:10,890
In the end, I'm not satisfied
unless I do it by myself.

140
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:14,827
If you do or make something yourself,

141
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:16,929
you can complain.

142
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,665
But if you have someone
do it for you, you can't.

143
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:22,835
I think a sense of responsibility
arises there.

144
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:26,772
It's better if we make ourselves do it.

145
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:31,277

149
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:51,531
{\an8}We are looking for partners
who will help us realize our vision.

00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:15,721
Good morning.

156
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:18,190
{\an8}I'm Joshima, the president.

Thank you.

This isn't just a company project.

168
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:46,052
This isn't simply
a request to do something.

169
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:50,656
We'd love to have discussions
about ideas that

170
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:53,125
we can't come up with ourselves...

171
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:58,598
<i>For the longest time, they've danced
and entertained on television.</i>

172
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:00,633
<i>Now they must come up with ideas.</i>

173
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:06,005
Please send us a video
that shows the texture of the udon.

174
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:09,875
The texture of
Marugame Seimen udon versus...

175
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:12,612
the texture of a baseball.

176
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:15,615
This isn't a meeting for a TV program.

177
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:20,353
-It was just an idea.
-Yeah, I know.

178
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:24,323
So you want the Marugame Seimen food truck

179
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:26,993
to go all around the country?

180
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:28,294
-That's great.
-Yeah.

181
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:31,364
People will come take a look
at the food truck.

182
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:36,469
Being able to actually visit
the food trucks

183
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:39,505
will energize people.

184
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:44,610
<i>In addition, they'll come up with
new menu ideas.</i>

185
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:47,780
This is our first meeting and here we are...

186
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,417
Focusing on what will make mothers happy

187
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,452
might be the most interesting.

188
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,690
It's very difficult though,
to create a balanced lunch meal.

189
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,726
A kid's meal may be good.

190
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:03,429
Yeah, something like that...

191
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,664
That's interesting.

192
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:09,502
Japanese people often eat udon when
they aren't feeling well or have a cold.

193
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:10,870
-Yeah.
-Right.

194
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:14,140
When my kids have fevers,
they'll eat udon.

195
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:16,108
Happily.

196
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:21,847
<i>The ideas they come up with
also require results.</i>

197
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:31,090
<i>Kokubun went back to the office that night</i>

198
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:33,626
<i>to brainstorm more ideas.</i>

199
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:40,399
You've been writing ideas
in there all day.

200
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:42,501
-Ah, yeah...
-Your notebook.

201
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:43,669
It's like,

202
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:48,074
I have to take notes when the client
becomes enthusiastic about something.

203
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:51,711
I've gotten a lot of use
out of this notebook.

204
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:53,679
-I've taken a lot of notes.
-Wow.

205
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:55,481
Yeah.

206
00:11:55,548 --> 00:12:00,453
It would be nice if we could create
some merchandise like this.

207
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:04,290
Here's some ideas for stickers.

208
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,827
This design is
on the back of the notebook.

209
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:10,629
You already have it created.

210
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:15,101
This is pretty interesting.

211
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:19,138
There's fun in seeing an idea
become a tangible item.

212
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:23,342
What changes
when something becomes a tangible item?

213
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:27,747
As a company,
we have to do everything ourselves, right?

214
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:28,981
Yeah.

215
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:34,186
In many cases we won't get any work
if we're not proactive.

216
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:38,591
Artists and entertainers
are often a part of a large company.

217
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:43,429
For TOKIO Inc., I'm the point of contact.

218
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:47,533
This means I have to work myself.

219
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,469
I'm not young anymore.
I can't just rely on others.

220
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:52,838
The president's in his fifties now.

221
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:56,342
He's fifty-one years old.

222
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:02,047
{\an8}MAY

223
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:04,316
{\an8}Good morning.

224
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:09,355
{\an8}<i>Today Kokubun's visiting a test kitchen
to try out some new menu items.</i>

225
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:12,391
{\an8}-Thank you for coming.
-Oh no, it's my pleasure.

226
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:16,796
<i>He'll be testing an idea
he thought of during the meeting,</i>

227
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:19,498
<i>the udon lunch meal for children.</i>

228
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:24,303
<i>He'll be selecting
each ingredient himself.</i>

229
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:31,143
It has to be something nutritious
for the parents to consider,

230
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,813
while making the children happy.

231
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:38,617
From a food education perspective,
if the meal's contents are well-balanced,

232
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:40,419
there's your answer.

233
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:44,490
In the future, it could also be part
of the household menu.

234
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:45,391
You're right.

235
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:49,161
We'll need a meal
that could be used as a sample.

236
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:55,968
<i>Kokubun himself is a father
taking care of his children.</i>

237
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:58,971
You could say they're moody...

238
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:05,477
-Let's try a piece of fried chicken.
-That's the top recommendation.

239
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:06,412
-This is?
-Yes.

240
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:07,847
-Is it?
-Yes.

241
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:10,683
I can't imagine udon with fried chicken.

242
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:11,584
Right?

243
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:15,621
I'm sure a fried wiener
will make them happy.

244
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:17,423
A little bit of this...

245
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:21,727
As a parent, I'd want to put something
with more color in their meal.

246
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:25,197
A long time ago,
we used to put corn with the udon.

247
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:28,334
Children loved it with the corn.

248
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,635
Even just with corn.

249
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:35,708
This is good.

250
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:42,548
This is good. It fits perfectly.

251
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:45,117
The fried shumai works really well.

252
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:49,922
Let me take this piece of broccoli
and put it in here.

253
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:53,926
-How about mayonnaise on the broccoli?
-Do we have any mayonnaise?

254
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:56,462
Maybe it's because I'm an old man...

255
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:02,768
I feel relieved when there's boiled food
to go along with the fried stuff.

256
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:04,770
Is it because I'm an old man?

257
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:10,342
Experiencing the meal directly
leads to even more ideas.

258
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:19,351
Parents will usually open up
the packet of broth for their children.

259
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:22,621
If the children
could do this by themselves,

260
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:25,557
that would save time and effort
for the parents.

261
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:28,294
Opening the broth packet
isn't easy for kids

262
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,029
and will cause a huge mess.

263
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:31,931
Yeah.

264
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:39,104
Would it be possible, um...

265
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:45,344
before we present something,

266
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:49,715
to have a group of mothers
try out the meal ahead of time?

267
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,484
I want to be loved by everyone.

268
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:57,156
So if somebody said that
this is completely awful,

269
00:15:57,222 --> 00:15:58,524
it'd be a bit...

270
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,726
I've become pretty scared of that.

271
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:05,397
<i>What kind of meal will he create?</i>

272
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:11,103
{\an8}-Hello. Good morning.
-Good morning.

273
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,072
{\an8}Thank you for having me today.

274
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,073
{\an8}Your arm.

275
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:18,444
{\an8}<i>The children's udon lunch meal that
TOKIO Inc. created</i>

276
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:21,780
{\an8}<i>will be tasted
by their client company's president.</i>

277
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:23,315
{\an8}TORIDOLL HOLDINGS

278
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:28,988
<i>They paid most the attention to
the ingredients' nutritional balance.</i>

279
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:36,095
<i>They improved the broth container,
making it easy to open for children.</i>

280
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:42,134
Excuse me. This is the kid's udon meal,
in regular and large sizes.

281
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:43,635
I'm really nervous.

282
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:45,270
It looks nice.

283
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,172
-It's colorful.
-Yes, very.

284
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:49,141
Thank you for the meal.

285
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:52,077
Yeah, yeah.

286
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:57,116
Yes, yeah.

287
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:00,786
Yes, this is delicious.

288
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:04,390
I feel like I'm a child.

289
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,593
-Pretty good.
-Is it okay?

290
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:08,794
Yes.

291
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:12,931
Mr. Joshima also had some.

292
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:15,300
He said the corn is sweet and delicious.

293
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,269
He complimented the colors too.

294
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:19,938
Really? That makes me happy.

295
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,643
-The president approved?
-Yes, he did.

296
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,845
That makes me happy.

297
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:30,482
<i>There's one more idea.</i>

298
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:35,487

<i>Matsuoka is in charge of this.</i>

301
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:50,035
Making these meals is a hobby for me.

302
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:52,671
I really do enjoy making them.

303
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,143
<i>Matsuoka is known for his love of cooking.</i>

304
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:01,313

00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,899
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

310
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:22,668
Oh, it looks good.

311
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:25,704
I like the tomato.

312
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:28,707
-It's the tomato.
-Yeah.

313
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,043
The tomatoes are wonderful, yeah.

314
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,845
It's nice and spicy.

315
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:34,713
Yeah, it's nice and spicy.

316
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,448
This is the menu for summer this year.

317
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:39,051
I'm so happy to hear that.

318

<i>In the end, both items were discontinued

319
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:48,460
Thank you very much.

00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:51,797
-Thank you for today.
-Thank you for coming.

321
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,439
TOKIO INC.

322
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:05,911
<i>As pop idols get older,
they are faced with decisions to make.</i>

323
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,583
<i>Why did these three choose
to establish a company?</i>

324
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,056
We were fixated

325
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:22,494
on using the TOKIO name for our company.

326
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:24,930
With all the experiences we've had,

327
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:29,568
we didn't want to lose
the core essence of the name TOKIO.

328
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:36,375
That's why it felt right to create
another set of experiences.

329
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:38,677
It felt appropriate.

330
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:44,750
As for the three of us working together,
people were opposed to it.

331
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:47,286
It was not like...

332
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,323
we were encouraging ourselves.

333
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,425
When you get to this age,

334
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:56,695
you've experienced
a lot of different things.

335
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:58,931
And using your own filter,

336
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:02,100
you think about new ways
to express yourself.

337
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:06,605
What's a road
that can only be paved by TOKIO?

338
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:10,375
We have to create a new path.

339
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:14,479
At my age and being part of this company...

340
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:22,554
it fills me with excitement to be able to
try approaching new things.

341
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,156
"That's intriguing."

342
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,092
"I've never established a company before."

343
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:28,860
Somehow...

344
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:32,497
Those kinds of things motivate me.

345
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:37,002
{\an8}AUGUST

346
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,972
{\an8}-Thank you for having me.
-Thank you for coming.

347
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:47,079
<i>Today, another campaign idea
from the meeting has come to fruition.</i>

348
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:51,383
<i>Creating a food truck.</i>

349
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:58,924
<i>The truck has been decorated
with wooden panels, as per TOKIO's style.</i>

350
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:10,269
<i>Each little idea is brought to fruition
one at a time.</i>

351
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:14,473
<i>It all starts there.</i>

352
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:20,979
That's good.

353
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:22,381
-Is it good?
-I did it.

354
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,582
-Okay.
-Thank you.

355
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:25,517
-Thank you.
-I did it.

356
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:34,760
This is really good.
You've done a great job.

357
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:39,831
<i>On the next</i> RIDE ON TIME<i>...</i>

358
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:42,167
I just want to clean it up.

359
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:47,472
{\an8}<i>TOKIO Inc. has hit the ground running.</i>

360
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:52,444
{\an8}<i>They sweat and work every day.</i>

361
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:56,281
{\an8}Now that there's only three of us,
so I have no choice.

362
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:02,054
{\an8}<i>And Kokubun's back on the music stage.</i>

363
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:06,058
{\an8}I do like to create things.

364
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:09,394
{\an8}I'm showing proof
I'm participating in something.

365
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:13,999
{\an8}<i>Realizing those passions.</i>
