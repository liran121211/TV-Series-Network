00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:04,998
{\an8}All right, yeah!

25
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:07,600
I thought about a lot of things.

26
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:10,737
"If things continue like this...

27
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:14,941
I honestly might think of
doing other work."

28
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,944
If Mr. Johnny said "No," I'd have quit.

29
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:20,180
Junta told me he would too.

30
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,247
We both said the same thing.

31
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:25,018
"If Junta's not here,
then I don't need to do this."

32
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:30,857

{\an8}<i>are challenging themselves
with personal projects.</i>

38
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:12,432
I did it! I won.

39
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:17,437
I was wiped out in the first round.

40
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:20,140
{\an8}<i>Junta Nakama.</i>

41
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,510
{\an8}-Junta Nakama!
-Oh yeah! Yay!

42
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:25,712
{\an8}<i>He's the oldest member in the group.</i>

43
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:27,380
{\an8}<i>And since April this year,</i>

44
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:30,650
{\an8}<i>Nakama's received many offers
to be on quiz shows.</i>

45
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:36,122
The results depend on
how much I study every day.

46
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:39,926
When I first participated on <i>Toudaiou</i>,
I didn't know anything.

47
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:41,961
After I started joining these shows,

48
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:45,632
I've started watching the news.

49
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:47,934
Then I thought,
"Oh, I might be able to do this."

50
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,402
I am able to see different view points.

51
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:51,504
That sometimes happens
when I'm on the shows.

52
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:56,776
<i>We had Nakama show us his study notes.</i>

53
00:02:57,277 --> 00:03:01,381
<i>The miscellaneous trivia he looked up...</i>

54
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:05,218
These famous historical figures
have interesting stories.

55
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:07,287
It's quite fun to look them up.

56
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,290
I'm studying more now
than when I was a student.

57
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:13,526
I made a promise about university
with my mom.

58
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:16,729
"If you're entering Johnny's,
go to university first."

59
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:19,098
She made me promise I'd graduate first.

60
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:22,635
I didn't like studying back then.

61
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:24,604
All right!

62
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:30,777
<i>For Nakama to join quiz shows,
he had to think a little differently.</i>

63
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:36,115
I think quiz shows are
what makes me unique in the group.

64
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:40,787
The other members,
they're all interested in acting.

65
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:44,624
If we all did that,
it would be pretty crowded.

66
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:49,195
So I decided that I would challenge myself
and do something unique to me.

67
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:51,898
I've set myself apart completely.

68
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:53,633
{\an8}NOZOMU KOTAKI (25)

69
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:58,004
{\an8}He's got a lot to compute in his mind
since he's the leader too.

70
00:03:58,838 --> 00:03:59,939
{\an8}And...

71
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:02,809
He's usually in control too.

72
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:07,046
It's not like he can do
whatever he wants though.

73
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:12,185
I think that's why
he's in these quiz shows.

74
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,121
When he does well on them,
he looks very satisfied.

75
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,624
I'm sure he has a lot of fun then.

76
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,294
{\an8}JUNTA NAKAMA (12 YEARS OLD)

77
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:26,165
{\an8}<i>Nakama was first interested in Johnny's
when he was 12 years old.</i>

78
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:32,171
When I was in fourth grade,
I went to Taiwan because of my dad's job.

79
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:34,941
It was around the time
I was in sixth grade,

80
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:39,512
that KinKi Kids had
their first concert in Taiwan.

81
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:42,348
Johnny's was having auditions
for Taiwan Jr.

82
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:45,718
Back then the only thing I did was play.

83
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:49,889
I wasn't good at school or sports
and I had no hobbies.

84
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,091
My parents were really worried.

85
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:54,661
They wanted to do something for me.

86
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:57,864
That's when my mom
found the audition notice.

87
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,465
So I went.

88
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:04,537
{\an8}I got into Taiwan Jr.
and stood up on stage for the first time.

89
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:07,040
{\an8}It was so fun and that was the start.

90
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:12,345
{\an8}When I first met Junta
I thought to myself,

91
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:14,714
{\an8}"Who is this dude? He's so cool."

92
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:17,784
{\an8}He was a bit clumsy though.

93
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:22,188
{\an8}He's smart but
since he was raised overseas,

94
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:25,425
{\an8}it seemed like he wasn't used to Japan.

95
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,527
It was very curious.

96
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:32,165
His intuition's foreign
but he's speaking Japanese.

97
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:36,102
Junta's got a creative power

98
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:40,973
that I think none of us,
including me, have.

99
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,809
It's amazing.

100
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,811
{\an8}SEPTEMBER

101
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:47,714
{\an8}<i>The beginning of September, Osaka.</i>

{\an8}<i>Using his individual charm,
Nakama was working on something.</i>

103
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,686
Good morning.

104
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:54,987
Good morning.

105
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,056
You surprised me.

106
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:58,391
I'll go in now.

107
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:06,432
{\an8}<i>Mainly broadcasted in Kansai, this is
a live morning news information program.</i>

108
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:09,602
Five seconds before start, four, three...

109
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:11,070
Okay Nakama...

110
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:15,475
<i>Nakama acts as a commentator
on various news topics.</i>

111
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,311
<i>He talks about his own opinions here.</i>

112
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:22,615
I've been wondering why
America withdrew its troops so suddenly.

113
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:25,051
How should I put this?

114
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:30,390
Being allowed to do a job where I can
express myself makes me really happy.

115
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:33,192
It includes this program
and the quiz shows.

116
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,863
I think it's mainly because
I was raised overseas.

117
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,031
I'm pretty straightfoward.

118
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:44,170
Being polite is important but at times
it makes it hard to see the truth.

119
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:47,273
I'm the type of person
who's pretty straightforward.

120
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,308
That's why I prepare,

121
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:53,880
research, and then comment.

122
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:58,484
If I say something unnecessary,
it'll cause problems for the group.

123
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:06,926
<i>But it's only recently that Nakama has
been feeling positive about the group.</i>

124
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:14,700
For the first five years after I debuted

125
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:18,070
It felt like we were calm at sea.

126
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:20,139
No tailwinds or headwinds.

127
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:24,310
The public didn't really know
about JOHNNY'S WEST.

128
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:26,946
I thought about a lot of things.

129
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:30,016
"If things continue like this...

130
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:34,320
I honestly might think of
doing other work."

131
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:35,455
Yeah.

132
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:39,892
Like retiring from the entertainment
industry, and do what I love.

133
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,128
I like fashion,
so something related to fashion.

134
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:46,999
A friend of mine has a shop.
I'd love to help out at that shop.

135
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,470
That's why I'm glad
that the group gets along.

136
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:54,807
Because we do it's always
fun to see them and I can carry on.

137
00:07:57,043 --> 00:08:01,914
{\an8}<i>In September, one member of the group

There's no Japanese translation for that.
Don't you know that?

141
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:09,989

<i>He's also the chairman of the play.</i>

150
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:33,713
The audience followed the infection
prevention rules while enjoying the play.

151
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,848
This allowed us to perform the play.

152
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:39,218
Their applause really hit me hard.

153
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:41,621
Especially this time,

154
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:47,960
I'm the chairman for this play,
so I have more responsibilities.

155
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:52,999
This time in particular,
Sexy Zone's So Matsushima's here too.

156
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:56,936
{\an8}It was his first time doing theater.

157
00:08:57,003 --> 00:09:00,573
{\an8}So I want him to enjoy his time here
and find theater fun.

158
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,777
You made Madonna your wife
and now you want to make her a concubine?

159
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:06,512
That's just like you.

160
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:09,549
You're just like our dead father!

00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,493
I was already dancing in my hometown.

165
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,728
There was a guy two years older.

166
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:27,099
He went for an audition

00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:33,205
{\an8}I wanted to dance and do similar things.

169
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:36,142
I wanted to work
in the entertainment industry.

170
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,744
That's what I wrote in the resume I sent.

171
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:43,816
But I was in my first year
of middle school at the time.

172
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:49,255
I had a mohawk and shaved my eyebrows.

173
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:50,623
I was a silly kid.

174
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,793
I guess that's exactly
what left an impression on Mr. Johnny.

175
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:56,329
He was touching my mohawk constantly.

176
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:58,230
It was spiky too.

177
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,167
"What's this hair of yours?"

178
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,136
"Nobody has a hairstyle
like this nowadays."

179
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:08,040
I don't know if he liked it or not.

180
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,009
{\an8}I can never forget.

181
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:12,545
{\an8}I thought it was scary. It was a mohawk.

182
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,813
{\an8}TAKAHIRO HAMADA (32)

183
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,848
{\an8}He didn't talk to me though.

184
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:21,387
But when I tried to talk to him,
he was surprisingly humble.

185
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,222
He said, "Nice to meet you!"

186
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,958
He's now that cheerful character
we all know.

187
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:28,094
"Nice to meet you! I'm Kiriyama! Yes!"

188
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,863
"Call me what you like! Please!"

189
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:35,067
{\an8}He's like an older brother.
That's how I felt.

190
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,503
{\an8}How should I put this?

191
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:40,339
{\an8}He treated me like a younger brother.

192
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:44,777
{\an8}Having older members like him around

193
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:48,547
{\an8}made it easier for younger me
to go to the training hall alone.

194
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,283
{\an8}I'm grateful for that.

195
00:10:53,386 --> 00:11:00,059
{\an8}<i>For Kiriyama, the one who's been with him
the longest is Junta Nakama.</i>

196
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:03,863
I think a year passed by then.

197
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:09,669
Junta joined Kansai Jr. and at a concert,

198
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:13,506
we were part of KanJani8's concerts.

199
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:16,475
We were in the elevator,
getting off the stage.

200
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:18,544
"You guys are B.A.D."

201
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:22,114
That means we're not good, right?

202
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,517
I had a mohawk then too...

203
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,252
I just let it go saying, "Oh yeah..."

204
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:28,788
"I guess you're right."

205
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,823
"Why are you telling me this in English?"

206
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:36,662
After that, Murakami the host
told us something.

207
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:38,431
"Will B.A.D. come over?"

208
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:40,433
"B.A.D. come over?"

209
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:43,536
"Oh didn't somebody
call us that in the elevator?"

210
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:45,705
Then's when I first knew.

211
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:49,241
"I guess we're a group now."

212
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:53,846
{\an8}<i>Just like this, in 2004</i>

213
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:58,584
{\an8}<i>Kiriyama and Nakama formed the unit B.A.D.</i>

214
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:00,386
{\an8}<i>Journeying together.</i>

215
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:09,128
{\an8}"AMEFURI → RAINBOW"

216
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:35,621
<i>Since then for 17 years,</i>

217
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:41,761
<i>the two have been chasing
the same dream in JOHNNY'S WEST.</i>

218
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:46,699
This is rare. Things usually change.

219
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:50,469
Junta's been with me this whole time.

220
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,639
When I was going to debut at Johnny's,

221
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:56,642
I went for direct talks.

222
00:12:56,709 --> 00:13:00,246
I was talking to Junta
and said, "Let's go talk to Mr. Johnny."

223
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:05,451
If Mr. Johnny said "No," I'd have quit.

224
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:08,487
Junta told me he would too.
We said the same thing.

225
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:11,590
"If Junta's not here,
then I don't need to do this."

226
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:15,294
And Junta said, "If Akito's not here,
then I don't need to do this."

227
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,062
It would be nice to debut,

228
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:21,233
but if we couldn't,
we decided we would walk a different path.

229
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,635
That's what we told Mr. Johnny.

230
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:25,137
That's how close I am with Junta.

231
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:28,407
There's not many friends
who would do that for you.

232
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,698
We were so scared
when we told Mr. Johnny that.

233
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:54,266
Honestly speaking.

234
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,269
We had our reasons as to
why we wanted to debut.

235
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,905
So we explained everything
to Mr. Johnny from the start.

236
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:05,211
He told us no then.
But it wasn't really no.

237
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:09,014
He said, "You don't need to.
It's like you've already debuted."

238
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:12,017
"Two of you will fill up
Nissay Theatre for a month."

239
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:16,055
"You'll fill up Shochiku
for a month with an audience."

240
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:18,490
"You're already starring in dramas."

241
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:21,060
We realized then we were already working.

242
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:24,129
"Mr. Johnny's right..." We couldn't respond.

243
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:28,534
We told him we're grateful
and thankful for our situation.

244
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:32,738
And then the talks just ended
on that note.

245
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:35,241
The next day at 6 a.m.,
Mr. Johnny woke us up.

246
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:37,243
He said, "Wake up, wake up!"

247
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:38,510
"What's going on?"

248
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:40,813
"We got the recording company."

249
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,483
"Isn't it too early?
You told us we'd know at noon."

250
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:50,122
We got so many calls since morning.
The phone wouldn't stop ringing.

251
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:57,830
I guess it's because we
went to have direct talks with Mr. Johnny.

252
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,065
That's why we couldn't afford to fail.

253
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:07,273
{\an8}<i>This is why Kiriyama
continues to hold conviction.</i>

254
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:09,742
{\an8}<i>This applies even for non-Johnny's work.</i>

255
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:11,076
{\an8}CONVICTION

256
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:14,413
Everything I do is for the group.

257
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,116
I'm seeing many people for the first time.

258
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:21,353
By seeing my performance,
I want them to think well of me.

259
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:25,224
If they do, they might look me up
and see that I'm from JOHNNY'S WEST.

260
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:30,362
Then they can try listening to our songs
or try going to our concerts.

261
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,631
This is my hope when I'm working solo.

262
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:37,469
<i>Nakama feels the same way.</i>

263
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:42,741
Seeing us in different places
will give us exposure to new audiences.

264
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:46,912
People will recognize us more.

265
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:49,615
People will get excited
when we're all together.

266
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:53,218
There are two members
playing the lead part in dramas.

267
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,620
In the same season too.

268
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:58,357
Three to four people
starring in theater plays.

269
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:00,826
And me, starring in quiz shows.

270
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:04,063
When we're on music shows,
people will realize we're a group.

271
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,899
"This guy and this guy
are in the same group."

272
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,801
That's the ideal.

273
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:11,070
It's like we're all Avengers.

274
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,505
That's the group we strive to be.

275
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:21,947
<i>In all this, there's one member
who's been observing them all...</i>

276
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,151
Is that what it is?

277
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:32,691
<i>JOHNNY'S WEST members
have their own personal projects.</i>

278
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:37,329
<i>But this man misunderstood something.</i>

279
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:42,735
No, I haven't gone to see it yet.
But of course I will go to watch it.

280
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:43,936
{\an8}RYUSEI FUJII (28)

281
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,138
{\an8}<i>The group's most airheaded character.</i>

282
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:47,706
{\an8}<i>Ryusei Fujii.</i>

283
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:49,108
{\an8}<i>VS TAMASHI</i> FILMING

284
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:53,746
{\an8}<i>We discovered something during a shoot
for a program Fujii's a regular in.</i>

285
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:58,417
{\an8}<i>Kiriyama's play</i> Aka Shirt.

286
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:02,454
{\an8}<i>Before Fujii goes to watch it,
there's something he's curious about.</i>

287
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:05,524
I thought it looks interesting.

288
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:10,729
Kiriyama plays the Aka Shirt, right?

289
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:13,565
I see.

290
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:16,402
It's like the Aka Shirt has come to life.

291
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:22,641
<i>It seems like Fujii thinks
Kiriyama is not playing a human,</i>

292
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,677
<i>but rather a red shirt.</i>

293
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,180
Wait a moment!

294
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,149
<i>When we tell him the truth...</i>

295
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:33,719
Is that what it is?

296
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,323
The explanation was
"The Aka Shirt's point of view."

297
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,626
I was wondering what that was about.

298
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:44,596
I don't know anything about <i>Botchan</i>.

299
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:47,766
"The Aka Shirt's point of view."

300
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,102
Wouldn't you think it's a shirt?

301
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:55,274
<i>How did the members
react to Fujii's misunderstanding?</i>

302
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,710
I'm what? I'm playing a shirt?

303
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:00,946
I mean Akito you...

304
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,650
<i>Botchan</i> from the eyes of a shirt.

305
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:06,585
That's a new way to think about it.

306
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:08,620
I'm what? I'm playing a shirt?

307
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:12,191
I mean Akito you could be
hanging like this from a clothes hanger.

308
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:17,229
To be honest,
I'm not familiar with <i>Botchan</i>.

309
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:19,231
That's why I thought you were a shirt.

310
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:20,165
Simply genius.

311
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:23,735
A fight breaks out while you're talking.

312
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:26,105
Then the spotlight comes on.

313
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:28,107
This is a comedy skit.

314
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:33,312
"Oh, I should have done this back then."

315
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:36,181
What kind of play is this?

316
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:37,516
Hey...

317
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:38,417
ONE WEEK LATER

318
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:40,819
Fujii's really hilarious.

319
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:42,888
He's a genius.

320
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,757
He'll definitely stay
in the entertainment industry.

321
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:47,693
Seriously.

322
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:54,099
{\an8}<i>Today's Kiriyama is the host
for the recording of a variety show.</i>

323
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,334
{\an8}Thank you.

324
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:58,704
<i>Laugh! Turn Table.</i>
It's a two-hour special!

325
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:03,275
<i>The show is mainly about
comedians performing songs.</i>

326
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:06,245
Comedian Shinichi usually ends the show,

327
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:09,681
but this is a special collaboration
with JOHNNY'S WEST's Tomohiro Kamiyama.

328
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:12,151
{\an8}<i>I went to India for only a week</i>

329
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:13,519
{\an8}<i>But my values have changed</i>

330
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:15,821
{\an8}<i>A fellow group member Kamiyama
joins the show.</i>

331
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:17,856
<i>In addition...</i>

332
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:23,729
Tonight we have Kogaken and JOHNNY'S
WEST's Junta Nakama for a special version!

333
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:25,597
<i>Nakama joins too.</i>

334
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:29,268
{\an8}<i>Glued to the television during work</i>

335
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,603
{\an8}<i>The security officer</i>

336
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,305
{\an8}<i>Doesn't notice the intruder</i>

337
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:35,274
It was very fun.

338
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:39,411
There were quite a few
important guests there.

339
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:41,647
It's reassuring to know one of our members

340
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:45,517
can handle and do a good job
at entertaining them.

341
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:48,453
If people laugh,
that makes me the happiest.

342
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,724
Seeing Akito laugh makes me really happy.

343
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,294
Akito is in charge
of this show as a presenter.

344
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,797
I know he wants
the whole program to be lively.

345
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,600
Showing that JOHNNY'S WEST is
doing stuff like this too.

346
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:04,303
You can feel the love.

347
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:06,471
It feels reassuring.

348
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:10,242
I don't feel like I'm by myself.

349
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:12,744
{\an8}This group is special.

350
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:16,582
{\an8}They're like family, like brothers.

351
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:18,483
{\an8}Like friends.

352
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:20,319
Like rivals.

353
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:25,290
These kinds of connections
just all seem to come up everywhere.

354
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:30,429
It's because they're
a part of JOHNNY'S WEST.

355
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:32,331
No matter where...

356
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:39,204
I think we'll be fine
as long as all seven of us are together.

357
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:46,445
{\an8}"SILHOUETTE"

358
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:59,324
It finally feels like
the winds are blowing in our favor.

359
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:03,862
If we keep this up,
it looks like it'll be a fun life.

360
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:10,435
But we still have a long way to go.
It's still a long way.

361
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:35,294
<i>On the next</i> RIDE ON TIME<i>,</i>

362
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:36,695
You haven't?

363
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:40,866
<i>This is the first time
Shigeoka's playing a father in a drama.</i>

364
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:45,737
{\an8}<i>What does he think about his own father?</i>

365
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:48,607
{\an8}I wanted to invite him
to a concert in Osaka.

366
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:51,710
{\an8}Being a good son seems easy
but it's actually quite hard.

367
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:54,279
{\an8}Why don't you just
tell your father you're grateful?

368
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:56,548
{\an8}I'll be back, you rascal.

369
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:04,256
{\an8}<i>And aiming for 2022,</i>

370
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,358
{\an8}<i>JOHNNY'S WEST is not slowing down.</i>

371
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,929
{\an8}Welcome to JOHNNY'S WEST's show!

372
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:11,830
{\an8}Yay!

373
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:15,067
{\an8}<i>Their futures...</i>

374
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:16,368
{\an8}Hey Kumamoto!

375
