I'm the vice president of TOKIO Inc.

00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:17,484
I'm Taichi Kokubun of TOKIO.

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,519

We truly appreciate your application.
Thank you.

<i>To choose their partner,</i>

12

<i>they have been interviewing
a wide variety of candidates.</i>

13
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:45,245
<i>The influence we received was huge...</i>

14
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:47,080
I have a question.

15
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:53,420
So am I correct in assuming that your firm
can support all farmers nationwide?

16
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:57,257
As for imperfect produce...

17
00:00:57,323 --> 00:01:01,928
Do you have any plans
to put these on the market?

18
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:06,466
Our president will be 70 years old
in 20 years, is that okay?

19
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,235
<i>It's okay.</i>

20
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:10,603
-That's good.
-It's all good...

21
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:16,042
<i>Is there anything you decided you won't do
as a company at the present time?</i>

22
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:17,844
You won't do...

23
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:21,314
Let's see... I don't think so.

00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:47,240
<i>This is documentary series</i> RIDE ON TIME.

{\an8}KOKUBUN, JOSHIMA, MATSUOKA

36
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:35,788
The main agenda for today is
to see if Matsuoka can use Zoom.

37
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:38,124
Yes, I heard.

38
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:40,894
Yeah, I don't know
so I'll leave it up to you.

39
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,130
But you can't just ask a manager.
Do it yourself.

40
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:46,299
I don't know how to approach this.

41
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:47,767
-Including that.
-Exactly.

42
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,502
I'll take a picture now.

43
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,104
Here we go.

44
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,875
This is my first time doing a video call.

45
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:57,911
You're so Showa.

46
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:03,616
<i>They've started to create something.</i>

47
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:10,490
What's a road
that can only be paved by TOKIO?

48
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:14,127
We have to create a new path.

49
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,728
"That's intriguing."

50
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:18,498
"I've never established a company before."

51
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:21,334
Those kinds of things motivate me.

52
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:25,738
{\an8}<i>Into an unseen world.</i>

53
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,410
Action!

54
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,279
Energize Japan with udon!

55
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:36,516
-Say it.
-Okay.

56
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:37,984
-Okay.
-It was our president.

{\an8}<i>Joshima challenges himself

Eat the <i>katsudon</i>.

61
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:57,570
You watch too many cheap detective dramas.

62
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:02,442
Two <i>chukadon</i> and two <i>gyoza</i>.

63
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:08,648
<i>Now 50 years old, this is his first time
as the main character in a drama series.</i>

64
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:11,217
Show me.

65
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:12,252
Stop it.

66
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:15,288
<i>He plays a mother raising
an adolescent son.</i>

67
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:18,358
Papa, he's hiding something.
I just know it!

68
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,860
-Oh, oh, oh!
-What? What are you doing?

69
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,962
-Ohhh!
-Ouch...

70
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:24,664
Let me go already.

71
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:27,000
Have you been properly resting?

72
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:30,903
Of course, I want to.
But I need time to read the lines.

73
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,505
I have to remember them.

74
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:36,643
Our group is in charge of composing
the main theme song for this drama.

75
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:41,781
My kid is asleep at night so I needed to
figure out where I could play instruments.

76
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:45,018
But I found some time
and composed up to the chorus for now.

77
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:48,388
But since then, I haven't had
much time to play any instruments.

78
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,624
What time do we start again?

79
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,194
<i>There's one thing
that supports him during these busy days.</i>

80
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:59,465
<i>Those are the memories of his mother
raising him with all her heart.</i>

81
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:07,540
<i>During a drama promotion interview...</i>

82
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:18,217
My mother is very old-fashioned,
very Showa period.

83
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:20,586
She's the stereotypical mother from Osaka.

84
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:25,425
My mother would always say,
"That's such a waste."

85
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,894
There's a river called Yamato River.

86
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:32,965
I caught two carp one time
when I was in elementary school.

87
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:36,502
I told her, "I got two of them!"
"That's wonderful," she would reply.

88
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:39,672
I put them in the water tank
in the back somewhere.

89
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:43,042
That night, we had grilled fish.

90
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:47,213
When I said, "My fish!"
She replied, "I grilled them."

91
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,781
"Just eat them," she said.

92
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:52,085
The next day, I came home
and I said, "I'm hungry."

93
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:55,188
I look over and she says,
"I boiled them in soy sauce today."

94
00:05:56,556 --> 00:06:01,127
Can you please place your legs
in the pink area? Thank you.

95
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,261
Here I go.

96
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:06,566
<i>Joshima did not have
an easy time as a young boy,</i>

97
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:09,302
<i>but he decided to become a pop idol.</i>

98
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,536
Okay.

99
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:12,905
FULL OF LOVE

100
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:20,246
{\an8}<i>In 1990, when the three formed TOKIO,</i>

101
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:22,749
{\an8}<i>Joshima was already 19 years old.</i>

102
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:28,221
<i>He was oldest and the leader of the group.</i>

103
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:29,822
UNDERSTAND THE EFFORT WE MAKE!

104
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:34,260
<i>Joshima wanted to change his life.</i>

105
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:38,865
I saw Shonentai on TV,

106
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:43,736
they were in the spotlight,
singing and dancing.

107
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:46,072
"I can't believe
there's a world like this."

108
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:50,209
If I jump into that spotlight,
my life will change.

109
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:56,215
I wanted to free myself
from everyday life.

110
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:58,117
I wanted to change.

111
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:02,021
I didn't belong anywhere,
so I wanted to jump into that spotlight.

112
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:07,326
I have memories
of feeling like that back then.

113
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:15,268
<i>However, 19 years old
is a slow start for a pop idol.</i>

114
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:19,772
<i>He had one weapon though.</i>

115
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,645
<i>That was the guitar.</i>

116
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:44,263
Makes me want to drink tea from a teacup.

117
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:48,267
Back home in high school,

118
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:51,337
I was already playing the guitar
and forming bands.

119
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:53,406
I thought I'd go for what I'm good at.

120
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,475
I used to play at the dorms.

121
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,543
Mr. Johnny saw me and said,

122
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:01,314
"If you like instruments so much,
why don't you form a band?"

123
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:05,685
And that's how TOKIO started.

124
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:10,957
<i>They were a rare type of an idol group.</i>

125
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:13,926
<i>TOKIO was born as a rock band.</i>

126
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:20,166
<i>Sometimes they would wear
T-shirts or nothing at all.</i>

127
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:22,935
<i>They've always done things their own way.</i>

128

130
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:32,512
Like it's for Nagase.

131
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:33,579
No, no.

132

Testing, testing.

138
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:01,040
-Something surprised me now.
-Yeah?

139
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:06,546
I was looking at my headphones
and couldn't see the "L" or "R" on it.

140
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:11,083
I know what you mean.
I know exactly what you mean.

141
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,251
It made me scared.

142

-The beginning...
-Yes?

153
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,331
It doesn't really sound like KanJani8.

154
00:09:58,397 --> 00:09:59,231
I see.

155
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:02,401
How should I put this? They're more...

156
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:04,971
-A little unrefined.
-Yeah.

Thank you for coming today.

171
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,574
You're the best. Thank you.

172
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:17,143
One picture.

173
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:19,478
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Mr. Sugi.

174
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:21,347
Just one more picture.

175
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:25,317
-Aren't you hot in this?
-How is this?

176
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:27,920
Your outfit looks a lot hotter, Mr. Sugi.

177
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,023
<i>On this day,</i>

178
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:35,861
<i>they had actually invited someone
who's a big fan of Mr. Sugi to the set.</i>

179
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:40,900
Thank you so much. Excuse me.

180
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:43,135
Thank you.

181
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:45,237
We're done.

182
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:47,873
I got here early so I was waiting here.

183
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,342
-I didn't want to be in the picture.
-Come with me.

184
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,279
<i>Joshima's mother.</i>

185
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,115
You look so young.

186
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:57,283
Not at all.

187
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:59,351
-No, you do.
-You're too kind.

188
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:01,454
I'm 77 years old.

189
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,156
I know.

190
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,792
I watched you in <i>Toyama no Kin-san</i>,
among others.

191
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:10,496
That was a long time ago.

192
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,164
-Thank you.
-Thank you for your time.

193
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,733
Thank you again so much.

194
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,103
-I'm so happy.
-I'm happy for you.

195
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:18,104
Thank you.

196
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,305
I'll call you later.

197
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:21,207
I have no regrets now.

198
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:22,942
I can die anytime now.

199
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:25,177
Thank you. Good luck!

200
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:35,755
{\an8}Thank you.

201
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:37,523
{\an8}<i>They're about to start recording.</i>

202
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,693
{\an8}KANJANI8 RECORDING FOR "KOKORO NI HANA"

203
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,595
Give it your best!

204
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:43,496
Huh?

205
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:47,166
Good to see you.

206
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:48,634
Good morning.

207
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,836
KANJANI8
YOU YOKOYAMA

208
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:56,108
You can do things at your own pace.

209
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:57,643
I'm always like this.

210
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:58,711
-Always?
-Yes.

211
00:12:58,778 --> 00:12:59,945
-That's amazing.
-What is?

212
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:00,980
Energetic from the get-go?

213
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:03,315
It's not really that,
I think of this as a job to do.

214
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:06,085
-Well, thank you for coming.
-Thank you for having me.

215
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,054
-That's amazing.
-No, not really...

216
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:21,333
<i>Joshima silently looks on.</i>

217
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,803
Excuse me, can I hear
the first part one more time?

218
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:32,912
<i>There, Joshima had his own thoughts
after being TOKIO's leader for many years.</i>

219
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:39,385
Everyone has their own way
of singing, acting, and living.

220
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:42,488
Their habits show
in their personality too.

221
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:44,156
Even if something feels missing,

222
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:46,525
there are times
when that's completely okay.

223
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:49,528
And there are times
when something's missing a tiny piece

224
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:52,198
and if we had it,
we would complete the puzzle.

225
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:54,466
But it's just that
one piece that's missing.

226
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:58,504
Like if it were a building,
even without that piece,

227
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,306
it won't fall down when it shakes.

228
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:02,441
I don't like things to be too perfect.

229
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:07,379
And I don't think any of us
in TOKIO are perfect.

230
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:09,481
But because of
the imperfections, the gaps,

231
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:12,985
we've been able to do well
and succeed in our endeavors.

232
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:16,455
And this would make me question
if there is a right way to do things.

233
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:20,426
<i>They don't try to fit
into a certain shape.</i>

234
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:26,866
{\an8}I think the Johnny's Shop
was established in 1988.

235
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:27,766
{\an8}JOHNNY'S SHOP HARAJUKU

236
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:31,904
{\an8}<i>This is his first visit to Johnny's Shop
in 20 some years.</i>

237
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,340
This brings back memories.

238
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:37,943
Ah...

239
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,482
There's TOKIO.

240
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:45,651
Wow.

241
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:48,587
Matsuoka was so cute.

242
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:53,392
When I think of Matsuoka,
this is the image I think of.

243
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:55,828
His cheeks were a little chubby.

244
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:59,164
We were all rascals back then.

245
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,402
Look at how unruly we were.

246
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:05,504
Here too.

247
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:07,640
And here too.

248
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:11,777
Johnny's groups usually wear
colorful clothing on stage.

249
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:14,780
People got mad and scolded us back then.

250
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:16,048
Yeah.

251
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:18,617
We relied on our seniors a lot too.

252
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:23,255
They paid for our meals
and doted on us as junior members.

253
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,457
The music that we played...

254
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:30,829
had a lot of that mixed into it.

255
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:33,632
It gave us the power to create something.

256
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,701
Only the three of us could do that...

257
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:38,804
It was our way of expression.

258
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:42,841
How should I put this?

259
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:48,981
It would be nice if we could find
a new way to express ourselves.

260
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:52,117
Sorry for making you stay so late.

261
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:53,652
Don't worry about it.

262
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:55,587
I'd like a Matsuoka set, please.

263
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:58,157
-Matsuoka's set?
-Yeah, the old one.

264
00:15:58,223 --> 00:16:00,826
-Would you like just his picture?
-Yes, of course.

265
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:03,963
I'll hang it up somewhere in the company.

266
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:05,731
This is nice.

267
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:11,270
I'll be going now.

268
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:12,571
Thank you so much.

269
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:16,875
-See you later.
-Okay.

270
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:19,645
-See you next time.
-Okay, goodnight.

271
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:27,920
<i>Half a year has passed
since the company's activies began.</i>

272
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:35,294
<i>They've been having many discussions
about the next project.</i>

273
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:49,541
The first year of a company
is all about creating a foundation.

274
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:51,877
What can we challenge ourselves to?

275
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:53,645
All sorts of foundations.

276
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:56,015
Foundations as a company.

277
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:58,083
Foundations as an entertainer.

278
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,685
Foundations as an individual.

279
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:03,922
I'd love it if we could
expand each one of them.

280
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:10,829
<i>The member have been clearing out
the different fields unique to them.</i>

281
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:14,299
Mr. Kokubun, thank you for your time.

282
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,902
Thank you for your call. This is Kokubun.

283
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:22,941
<i>Kokubun is joining in
a TV station's broadcast program council.</i>

284
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:28,280
<i>He has been asked his opinions
as an authority on creating TV programs.</i>

285
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:34,987
<i>The issue for discussion today
is about a certain variety program.</i>

286
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:38,390
...I believe I was able to
see a lot of that.

287
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:41,660
If I'm to speak from
a presenter's point of view,

288
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:45,030
I wouldn't want to be given
a specific format.

289
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:50,869
I believe all the presenters
will want to create something on the spot.

290
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:55,974
So I really liked how it was edited
to emphasize that this was happening.

291
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:59,244
Here's the host, Mr. Shigeru Joshima.

292
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:04,550
<i>Joshima will appear on a business program</i>

293
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:07,086
<i>as TOKIO Inc.'s president.</i>

294
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:10,456
Even if that's the case,
will we be able to reach that point?

295
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:11,857
<i>In addition...</i>

296
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:16,929

00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:33,645
Thank you.

299
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:34,713
Thank you.

300
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:41,353
Now you have to sing it in front of
the fans, share it, and then it's done.

301
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,856
Or maybe songs don't end just like that.

302
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:45,924
Maybe songs don't have an ending.

303
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:49,061
Since songs are passed down
to the people that listen to it.

304
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:55,667
{\an8}<i>Matsugoka goes onto

{\an8}DRAMA PRESS RELEASE

306
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:01,473
It was an acting experience
that I have never had before.

307
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,109
I have acted
in all sorts of things before,

308
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:07,179
but I believe this one
has left an impression on my heart.

312
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:22,094
-I'll see you later.
-Thank you. See you later.

313
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:24,163
Okay.

314
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:25,497
-Thank you.
-Good work.

315
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:32,971
Launching TOKIO Inc.
was the first step in our journey.

316
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:37,776
And we're all middle aged men now.

317
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:42,748
The president will be 60 in nine years.

318
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:45,817
We don't want anyone
to be responsible for us

319
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:47,786
and we don't want to be a big burden.

320
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,256
How can I put this?

321
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:55,394
If Shigeru Joshima can wear a red vest
and we can all laugh, it'll be okay.

322
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,828
If we keep that atmosphere,

323
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:01,533
I think we'll be able to do
something interesting.

324
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,868
I faintly feel that way.

325
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:08,507
Our group has made it this far
after experiencing so many failures.

326
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:13,011
"This time wasn't perfect,
so let's make the next one a success."

327
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:17,049
TOKIO is just that kind of group
that repeats that cycle all the time.

328
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:22,721
Having the quality to see people
for who and what they are

329
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:27,392
is probably the biggest factor
to enjoy us as a group.

330
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:31,797
I just love TOKIO as a group.

331
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:37,302
It's difficult to continually
work hard on something...

332
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:39,871
but it's important.

333
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:42,774
No matter how much we change,

334
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:45,410
I don't want to lose my home,
the place I belong.

335
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:48,447
I love TOKIO.

336
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:50,882
I'm objectively a fan.

{\an8}<i>Taichi Kokubun, age 47.</i>

341
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,238
{\an8}No way, no thanks!

342
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:14,706
{\an8}I don't want to do that.

343
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,775
{\an8}I don't want to put our backs together.

344
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:19,678
{\an8}We're too old to be
doing something like that.

345
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:20,912
{\an8}Ninety-seven years old.

346
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:29,221
<i>Their story has just gotten started.</i>

347
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,091
<i>Next time...</i>

348
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:38,297
{\an8}<i>In 2021, there's a group of seven
that was able to debut.</i>

349
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:39,665
{\an8}<i>Naniwa Danshi.</i>

350
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:43,669
{\an8}<i>One month before their debut announcement...</i>

351
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:45,237
BEFORE THEIR DEBUT

352
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:48,073
I don't know how we'll be,
but how do you want to be?

353
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,042
Naniwa Danshi in the future.

354
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:54,246
<i>They talk about
what they should aim for as idols.</i>

355
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:59,584
Like the pioneer of boy idols groups.

356
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,653
I want to be a hero to everyone.

357
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,622
To be acknowledged as an idol group.

358
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:06,224
I think everything ends
once we realize our possibilities.

359
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:07,726
We're here because of our fans.

360
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:10,329
I want to do things
nobody has done before.

361

<i>Backstage of Naniwa Danshi's debut.</i>
