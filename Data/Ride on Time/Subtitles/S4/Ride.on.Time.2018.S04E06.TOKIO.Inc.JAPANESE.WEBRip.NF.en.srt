00:00:02,268 --> 00:00:04,704
{\an8}Hello. This is President Joshima.

2
00:00:05,638 --> 00:00:08,575
{\an8}TOKIO Inc. will partner up with businesses

3
00:00:08,641 --> 00:00:13,446
{\an8}to spread the concept of creating things
to all the people of Japan.

4
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:19,753
{\an8}We are looking for partners
who will help us realize our vision.

5
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:24,557
<i>They were serious

FEBRUARY

7
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:28,328
As a promotion,

8
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:32,999
we're planning on releasing
this advertisement on April 1st.

9
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:38,538
I'm thinking that having an ad
in the Nikkei would be fun.

10
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:41,641
I think we should enjoy
the fun that the Nikkei has to offer.

11
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,978
We should have a one-page ad
because we're a company.

12
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:48,481
People will know us by releasing that ad.

13
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:53,720
We'll establish our company by
putting out a business card in the Nikkei.

14
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:56,790
<i>Sweat.</i>

15
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:58,825
<i>Work.</i>

16
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,827
<i>Experience.</i>

17
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:05,565
{\an8}<i>Days of realizing those passions
has now begun.</i>

18
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:32,092
<i>This is documentary series</i> RIDE ON TIME.

19
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:39,265
<i>TOKIO Inc.'s first project
began to turn its gears in April.</i>

Good morning.

21
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:46,706
I'm Joshima, the president.
Nice to meet you.

22
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:47,807
Wow...

23
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:51,144
<i>Creating things is
one of the company's philosophies.</i>

24
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:53,713
<i>Their first job is</i>

25
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:58,685
<i>teaming up with a national udon chain
to create new menu items.</i>

26
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:01,654
You can put some sashimi on it too.

27
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:02,989
Thank you.

28
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,760
<i>TOKIO Inc. developed ideas such as this.</i>

29
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:13,867
As a parent, I'd want to put something
with more color in their meal.

30
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:17,537
<i>It's an udon meal for children.</i>

31
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:25,612
<i>After much trial and error at home,
Matsuoka makes a new menu item,</i>

32
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:31,885
<i>curry udon that has tomatoes and eggs.</i>

33
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:37,657
This is the menu for summer this year.

34
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,193
I'm so happy to hear that.

35
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:45,798
<i>They're part of the whole process,
from beginning to end.</i>

36
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:46,699
Yeah.

39
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,446
Thank you for the meal!

40
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:03,316
<i>They're filming a commercial
for the children's udon meal.</i>

41
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,351
That looks good.

42
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:07,921
How is it? Do you like it?

43
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:08,955
Tamagoyaki.

44
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,057
Yay! Cool...

45
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:14,027
You look cool, awesome.

46
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:15,061
One, two...

47
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:20,667
<i>The wooden table in the commercial
was also built by the group.</i>

48
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:22,902
So, how is it?

49
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:26,272
<i>One week earlier.</i>

50
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:28,508
Good morning. Nice to meet you.

52
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,778
Good morning. I look forward to today.

53
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:33,780
Good morning. Let's do some work today.

54
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:37,183
Was building this table
your idea, Mr. Kokubun?

55
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,751
Yes, it was.

56
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:42,288
For some reason, I just said...

57
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:46,359
"Let's try building a table."

58
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,395
When I said that,

59
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:53,366
the others were like,
"That's a good idea!"

60
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:59,872
After all, our company motto is
"Sweat, work, and experience."

61
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,642
That's why I decided to sweat and work.

62
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:07,714
<i>Kokubun will build the tabletop.</i>

63
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:15,888
It feels like I'm actually working.

64
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:17,724
I'm actually working.

65
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:24,831
The tree has curves here too.

66
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:35,642
Have there ever been any entertainers
that have built their own sets?

67
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:38,678
I feel a sense of attachment to it though.

68
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:42,715
I might get mad if the filming crew
accidentally bumped into this.

69
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,150
Like, "Cut that out!"

70
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:48,288
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

71
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:49,389
Morning.

72
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:51,991
Any without cracks?

73
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:54,327
All of them have cracks...

74
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:57,196
<i>Joshima works on the legs of the table.</i>

75
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:13,313
I just want to clean it up.

76
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,448
This really shows your personality.

77
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:18,651
This is something you do quietly

78
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:21,688
but since we're on TV,
I have to say something.

79
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,324
That looks good. Thank you.

80
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,392
How about this part...

81
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:27,293
Very meticulous.

82
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:34,534
<i>Matsuoka works on putting it together.</i>

83
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:38,137
-All right.
-Okay.

84
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:42,475
I'm the one
that shouldn't be able to do this.

85
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,143
Yeah.

86
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:47,980
When it was the five of us,
I was the worst at this.

87
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:50,516
Now that there's only three of us,
so I have no choice.

88
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:52,218
Okay.

89
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,191
Okay. All right.

90
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,293
Okay.

91
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:07,300
This is cute.

92
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,068
Wow. If you had more time...

93
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:11,537
It looks handmade. It looks good.

94
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,307
Yeah, this is cute.

95
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:19,879
<i>Matsuoka sands the table,
so the children won't hurt themselves.</i>

96
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:23,716
This is nice.

97
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:26,252
It's nice and round.

98
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,722
Where should we stamp the table?

99
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:32,759
<i>The members
put their finishing touches on it.</i>

100
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:33,893
Oh I see.

101
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:37,497
-Here I go.
-Right in the middle?

102
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:38,531
Good.

103
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:39,832
It's a bit diagonal.

104
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:42,268
That could look good.

105
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:48,174
I want to take a picture.

106
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:50,510
-Done.
-It worked!

107
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,278
-Cool.
-I did it. It worked.

112
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:10,563
Take a picture of me.

113
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:14,867
What are you taking pictures of?

114
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,669
You should be taking pictures of me.

115
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:19,405
I think it's ready.

116
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:20,306
Really?

117
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:22,008
Here!

118
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:25,445
It's barely on there!

119
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,781
Hey!

120
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:31,184
This is really bad.

121
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:34,921
Everything was going well
until now. Sorry.

122
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:38,424
Well, it actually has
its own flavor, so it's okay.

123
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:39,859
You can try another spot.

124
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:41,093
Yeah, I'll do it again.

125
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,330
I have no problem showing my mistakes.

126
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:45,832
This is a mistake.

127
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:50,236
This one has a lot more smoke coming out.

128
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,706
-I think it's ready.
-No, no, no...

129
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:55,608
Here!

130
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:57,076
See? It's perfect.

131
00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:00,012
There it is!

132
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,181
I'm relieved.

133
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:04,016
This looks very cool.

134
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:06,953
Good.

When I feel the creative juices flowing,
I'll bring a MIDI keyboard with me.

141
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,938
I'll do this when I have some time.

142
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,543
I do like to create things.

143
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:06,012
No matter how I look at it.

144
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:08,648
No matter how I look at it,
I love creating things.

145
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,350
It just pops in my mind.

146
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:14,654
Those sorts of ideas
that make things interesting.

147
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:21,193
That's why I do things
I'm not even asked to do.

148
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:22,895
It's like...

149
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,933

I'm participating in something.

No, I'm completely free.

-Really?
-Yeah, it's really bad.

It can't be that bad...

What about concert tours?

168
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:20,453
-Those dried up.
-Really? That's too bad.

169
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:24,190
That's why I focus on
composing music right now.

170
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:26,559
I compose just a few songs as a hobby.

171

Sometimes I'm able to complete them.

172

00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:50,716
Hello, may I introduce myself?

181
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:55,354
I'm Taichi Kokubun. We established
TOKIO Inc. in April of this year.

182
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:56,288
Nice to meet you.

183
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:05,097
I've been thinking about the band name.

184
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,771
It's a bit long,

185
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,907
but it means
"make use of an opportunity immediately."

186
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:17,009
That's what it means if you rephrase it.

187
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:18,878
My interpretation of it is

188
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:22,815
"create something out of your passions."

189
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:25,351
And that's why I created this band.

190
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:26,352
Thank you.

191
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:30,256
That's nice.

192
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,158
So cool.

193
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:07,693
Awesome.

194
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:12,698
Could the people in the brass section...

195
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:15,334
dance or anything like that?

196
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,972
Can the guitars do like...

197
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:25,678
"I thought the guitars would be rock-like,
but it unexpectedly sounds like..."

198
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,748
That's the way I'd like it to be.

199
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:30,549
Just really that kind of mood.

200
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,219
That looks cool.

201
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:35,988
It's really cool.

202
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:39,458
<i>He also designed the logo for the band.</i>

203
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,828
I won't fit a medium...

204
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:50,302
That looks good on you.

205
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:52,004
Thank you.

206
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,108
That looks cool. You look like a DJ.

207
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:57,009
Totally a DJ.

208
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:03,415
{\an8}Six minutes left!

209
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:06,886
{\an8}Are there any staff members
without anything to do?

210
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:08,721
Please raise the roof.

211
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,222
Yay!

212
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,725
If you do, it'll energize the people here.

213
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,193
Okay!

214
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,795
Thank you.

215
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:29,775
{\an8}<i>TOKIO was formed back in 1990.</i>

216
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:36,549
{\an8}<i>At the time, the group consisted of
Kokubun, Joshima and Matsuoka only.</i>

217
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:39,084
{\an8}<i>Strangely enough,
the exact same members now.</i>

218
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:41,086
{\an8}HELLO, THIS IS TOKIO!

219
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:45,958
{\an8}<i>Living together at a boardinghouse,
they focused on their CD debut.</i>

220
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:52,531
<i>Their dream came true four years later.</i>

221
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:57,937
<i>But it wasn't smooth sailing
from the beginning.</i>

222
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:05,611
We wanted to get first place
right after we debuted.

223
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:11,083
When you debut in Johnny's,
you usually get first place.

224
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,485
Most artists will usually get first place.

225
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:16,121
That's how I thought it would be for us.

226
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:20,926
There were younger artists that
debuted after us, like Kinki Kids and V6.

227
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:23,295
And they all got first place
like it was nothing.

228
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:28,934
<i>The group decided to stick to
their own way of doing things.</i>

229
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:32,771
<i>They didn't wear
colorful clothing meant for pop idols,</i>

230
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:35,541
<i>but wore T-shirts
or nothing at all at times.</i>

231
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:40,946
<i>They've always shown
their true selves this whole time.</i>

232
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,619
We were almost naked.

233
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:49,955
I always thought
we should cover up a little more.

234
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:53,993
When we were younger...

235
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:57,730
We wore the colorful clothing
young idols wear now.

236
00:14:57,796 --> 00:15:01,467
But along the way,
we stopped wearing that kind of clothing.

237
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:04,370
{\an8}The opening starts
with something like this...

238
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:06,171
{\an8}<i>LEVECHI NA HITO, MITSUKETA</i> FILMING

239
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:10,910
{\an8}<i>After his idol days,
he worked as a presenter on TV.</i>

240
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:14,446
{\an8}<i>No matter what genre.
He carved out his own career path.</i>

241
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:16,181
{\an8}<i>DANSHI GOHAN</i> FILMING

242
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,549
{\an8}That's good.

243
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,819
{\an8}<i>KOKUBUN TAICHI NO OKIRAKU SANPO
~HAPPY GO LUCK~</i> FILMING

244
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:24,757
{\an8}<i>Kokubun has a record
number of TV appearances,</i>

245
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:27,693
{\an8}<i>topping first place six years in a row.</i>

246
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,229
{\an8}<i>TOKIO TERRACE</i> FILMING

247
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:32,564
{\an8}Nothing comes to mind using this.

248
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:37,336
I can't imagine coming up
with ideas while using this.

249
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:40,806
<i>August.</i>

250
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:44,643
Can I get in the car?

251
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:45,844
Yes, please.

252
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:48,247
Am I riding in this one?

253
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:49,682
Excuse me.

254
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:57,189
<i>Kokubun was put in charge of
a cheerleading team for the Tokyo Olympics</i>

255
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,692
<i>by a certain television station.</i>

256
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,469
{\an8}<i>While gathering information
on the athletes,</i>

257
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:13,872
{\an8}<i>he also learned a few things
he could apply to his own work.</i>

258
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:25,584
The beauty of sports
isn't just about the medals.

259
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,987
It's the process.

260
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:30,589
The beauty of the process
of getting to this point.

261
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,225
That's what moves me.

262
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:36,528
I believe the process
is extremely important.

263
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:41,734
That's what makes it easy for me
to give it my best at whatever I do.

264
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:47,306
I believe it's important
to be inspired by other people.

265
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,274
Good work.

266
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,409
I look forward to it.

267
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:51,910
Yes, thank you.

268
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:58,884
JUNE WANGAN STUDIO

269
00:16:58,951 --> 00:16:59,885
<i>On this day,</i>

270
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:04,256
<i>a meeting that would predict
the future of TOKIO Inc. took place.</i>

271
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,493
We'll do everything here.

272
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:08,627
Here?

273
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,295
Yes. We'll take it here first.

274
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,196
Thank you.

275
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:16,602
<i>TOKIO Inc. is starting a project to create
things by partnering with organizations.</i>

276
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:18,804
<i>There were many applications.</i>

277
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:25,010
Wow. Look at all these applications.

278
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:28,247
There's so many of them, I'm so grateful.

279
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:31,784
<i>They had more applications
than anticipated.</i>

280
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,752
Start with number one.

281
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:34,720
Oh, from the bottom.

282
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:37,623
We'd like you to narrow it down
to 10 to 15 companies.

283
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:40,459
Please start choosing ones
that interest you.

284
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:42,261
I'll take a close look on my own.

285
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:43,462
Yeah, I agree.

286
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:45,531
I'd like to take my time to look at these.

287
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:47,900
If you see something...

288
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:48,934
Something we like...

289
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:50,803
And you need more information,

290
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:54,873
please tell me what number
and I'll send you their information.

291
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,508
So please let me know.

292
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,245
<i>Even while working on other projects,</i>

293
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:03,048
<i>they take their time
looking at each proposal.</i>

294
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,458
With all these people joining us

295
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:16,295
and working together to create something...

296
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:20,232
I feel like there's a vision.

297
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,801
I feel closer to them.

298
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:27,306
It's the idea of pursuing one thing

299
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:30,342
and creating something from scratch.

300
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:33,212
It feels like
there's a deep meaning to it all.

301
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:38,217
<i>There's a memory
that Joshima will never forget.</i>

302
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:44,156
<i>It happened 29 years ago.</i>

303
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:48,160
<i>It was before TOKIO debuted
with their first CD.</i>

304
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:51,029
AUGUST 28
HARAJUKU

305
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:55,834
When was the last time
I walked down this road?

306
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:57,636
It's the same.

307
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,539
<i>It was their first handshake event</i>

308
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:02,941
<i>which took place in this
Johnny's Shop in Harajuku.</i>

309
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:04,910
It's exactly the same as before.

310
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:07,112
Wow.

311
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:13,385
Before we debuted as TOKIO,
we had a handshaking event here.

312
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:17,990
We wanted to raise our recognition
and see if there were any fans.

313
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:22,361
"How many people could we attract?"
All of us were so excited.

314
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:25,864
Our boardinghouse wasn't too far
from here.

315
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:27,566
We were curious.

316
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:29,768
"It would be amazing
if there was a line here."

317
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:35,807
We peeked outside the window
and saw there was a little bit of a line.

318
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:38,043
"What is that?"

319
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:41,813
"What do we do if it's for us?"

320
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,683
When we came, it was for us.

321
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:48,387
The fans were lining up.

322
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:51,690
They saw us and were like, "Wow!"

323
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:56,261
It's one memory I have
seeing them through the window.

324
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:59,031
It was very touching.

325
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,567
That brings back memories.

326
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:03,769
Wow...

327
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:06,805
In that way...

328
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:09,508
They're emotions I can't let go of

329
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,779
in the history of TOKIO...

330
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:16,381
This place is a holy ground for us.

331
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:18,417
Yeah.

332
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:21,053
I'm so grateful to all the fans.

333
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:23,255
Yeah.

334
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:27,159
That made me really happy.

335
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:36,702
<i>The joy of creating something
with someone left a mark in his heart.</i>

336
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:47,746
<i>They're now working on a photoshoot
to promote the udon chain restaurant.</i>

337
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,683
Don't pan the camera.

338
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:55,420
Yes, thank you.

339
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:56,855
I don't...

340
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,391
I don't usually get embarassed.

341
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,093
But these make me so embarassed.

342
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:03,295
-Sorry.
-Seriously...

343
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:05,464
Yeah, that looks good.

344
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:09,901
<i>During this photoshoot,</i>

345
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:13,505
<i>there was one member
who did exactly what the cameraman said.</i>

346
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:15,240
<i>It was Matsuoka.</i>

347
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,577
After that...

348
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:21,313
Okay, I got it.

349
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:25,550
Smile like you're sending
a message to the children.

350
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,886
That's great. Perfect.

351
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:31,490
"Let's do our best!" "Be healthy!"

352
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,859
That's wonderful.

00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,829
<i>What memories
have left an impression on Matsuoka?</i>

354
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:38,830
Nice.

355
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,869
{\an8}-It's okay, you can sit there.
-Thank you.

356
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:47,306
{\an8}<i>Next time, the one side of Matsuoka
that we don't know.</i>

357
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:52,577
{\an8}"If I can hold my breath
until I get out of this tunnel,

358
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:55,213
{\an8}I'll make it into Johnny's."
I did that a lot.

359
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,983
{\an8}Of course. Very much a coward.
I'm like a Pomeranian.

360
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,085
{\an8}Well... If left alone, I would die.

361
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:04,289
{\an8}<i>He's strict yet nice.</i>

362
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:09,428
{\an8}If I brought your family here,
your dad points would go up.

363
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:12,864
{\an8}What am I saying on this program?
