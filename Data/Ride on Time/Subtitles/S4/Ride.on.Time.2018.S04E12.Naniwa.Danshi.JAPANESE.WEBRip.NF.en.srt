{\an8}DAIGO NISHIHATA (25)

00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:54,954
I seriously didn't think
that my efforts would ever pay off.

14
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:56,122
Yeah.

15
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:01,728
{\an8}But what I've been doing wasn't
a mistake all this time.

16
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:04,297
{\an8}That's what I strongly think now.

-Oh, it's chicken!
-Wow, it's chicken!

24
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:54,280
How many Christmases
have you spent with us?

25
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:56,049
Three out of four years.

26
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,717
Nice job!

31
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:33,820
{\an8}Ever since Naniwa Danshi
was formed, it's been like this.

32
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:35,922
{\an8}That's honestly scaring me.

33
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,023
{\an8}You know...

34
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:42,195
If you go up,
there's gonna be a time you go down.

35
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:46,132
When we fall, we'll need to work together.

36
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:50,236
Right? And overcome it.

37
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:53,973
If we can get a nice wave going,
that'd be great.

{\an8}NANIWA DANSHI INTRODUCTION
"UBU LOVE"

42
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,364
So big!

43
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:20,400
Wow!

44
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,536
Oh, so that means there's three stages.

45
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:26,806
A band stage, dance stage, and main stage.

46
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:29,075
There's a moving stage too.

47
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:32,712
<i>Jun Matsumoto of Arashi directed it,</i>

48
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:35,548
<i>and 13 debuting groups all attended.</i>

49
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:39,652
<i>Naniwa Danshi was scheduled
to perform their debut song</i>

50
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,088
<i>before the audience for their first time.</i>

51
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:47,527
Wow, it's super pink.

52
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:51,998
<i>The costumes were renewed
by Matsumoto's orders.</i>

53
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,434
Wow, this will stand out.

54
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:57,370
{\an8}Looks like we'll stand out, huh?

55
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:59,038
{\an8}The costumes most of all.

56
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:00,273
{\an8}RYUSEI ONISHI (20)

57
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:06,479
{\an8}<i>Matsumoto only notified the reason
behind the costume change</i>

58
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:10,650
{\an8}<i>to Kento Nagao, the one in charge
of Naniwa Danshi's costumes.</i>

59
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:11,584
{\an8}Oh, thank you.

60
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:12,652
{\an8}KENTO NAGAO (19)

61
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,823
You know how the current costumes
for "Ubu LOVE" are a little weak?

62
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:19,425
When we're on stage
and it doesn't stand out...

63
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:22,095
You know, since it's big...

64
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:26,699
I think our image gets thinned out.

65
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:30,837
That's why if we use bright pink,
people's eyes will focus on us.

66
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:34,674
There aren't many occasions
we can have Jun make our costumes.

67
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:37,343
So we're really thankful
and happy about it.

68
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,380
I told Jun we'll leave it to him.

69
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:47,487
<i>The choreography was also rearranged
for the dome concert.</i>

70
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:50,189
So, um...

71
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:51,958
I'm the choreographer, Take.

72
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:54,560
We're Naniwa Danshi! Nice to meet you!

73
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,796
Thank you. Nice meeting you.

74
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:59,432
<i>The choreographer
who directs Arashi's dances.</i>

75
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:02,435
You'll be memorizing
"Ubu LOVE" a bit today.

76
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:07,340
So, you boys don't know the moves
of "Maemuki Scream!"

77
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:09,075
For this Johnny's Festival,

78
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:12,578
Jun wants you to focus on the performance,

79
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,581
so he wants you to memorize
the numbers yourselves.

80
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:18,818
And in that case,
you'll have to decide yourselves.

81
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:22,021
It's a number hell,
but try hard to memorize them.

82
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:23,589
-Yes.
-Okay.

83
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:29,962
<i>The formation changes according
to the stage.</i>

84
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:39,472
And don't come forward too much
because they'll come in front of you.

85
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:40,840
The first one...

86
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:43,142
If I'm around one, is that okay?

87
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:44,444
I can't go in too much.

88
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,878
That's right, yeah.

89
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:48,481
Michieda, you aim for where Jo was at.

90
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:50,416
Okay.

91
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:52,618
I was in front quite a bit.

92
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,954
-Oh, everyone, there...
-Here, yes.

93
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:59,692
For the song's position, stay at the same
place from Ohashi's last chorus.

94
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:01,294
{\an8}Did it change?

95
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:04,764
{\an8}It changed a lot. The moves are
programmed into our bodies.

96
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:05,832
{\an8}JOICHIRO FUJIWARA

97
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:08,134
{\an8}So even if it's our usual dance,

98
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:11,604
{\an8}we'll panic if we have
to shift our dance timings midway.

99
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:13,005
I see.

100
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:16,476
Yeah, so our brains are mixed up there.

101
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:24,183
{\an8}<i>Even the normally skillful
Kyohei Takahashi, seemed confused.</i>

102
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:28,187
{\an8}KYOHEI TAKAHASHI (21)

103
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:29,655
-And you walk.
-I walk.

104
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,324
Then go to the lower step.

105
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,258
Lower step?

106
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:36,462
The stairs here. This is the lower step.

107
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:37,997
Wait, next? What?

108
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:41,234
Um, that's gonna spread more?

109
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,502
That's right.

110
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:47,573
<i>The directions were
the most detailed ever.</i>

111
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:52,178
<i>They learn the reason behind that
at theTokyo Dome rehearsal.</i>

112
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:57,917
It hasn't felt this tight in a while.

113
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,989
Well, time. It's been a while
since we had no time like this.

114
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:09,962
{\an8}<i>And Michieda and Ohashi
had another big role waiting for them.</i>

<i>They were assigned as backup dancers
for their seniors, KinKi Kids.</i>

118
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:41,627
All right, looks good.

119
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:42,895
No, no, it's bad!

120
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,397
-It's bad? Really?
-A bit.

121
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,331
Should we recheck?

122
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:46,466
The music once more...

123
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:48,067
Let's do it again with sound.

124
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,769
Once more please.

125
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:56,175
{\an8}<i>With only a day of practice,

127
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:02,582
{\an8}<i>There were monitors
at every corner of the stage.</i>

128
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:06,285
{\an8}<i>A performance mixed
with video was key to the concert.</i>

MIC BASE

130
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:27,039
What are they gonna start with?

131
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:28,741
Scary.

132
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:36,983
<i>Good morning, everyone. Let's do our best.</i>

133
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:38,217
<i>The rehearsal.</i>

134

<i>Let's do our best!</i>

138
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,928
<i>Come down slowly there.</i>

139
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:52,431
<i>Um, when your body sways,
we can't capture you.</i>

140
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:54,100
<i>Yes, okay.</i>

141
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:56,335
<i>-Michieda.
-Yes.</i>

142
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:57,904
<i>This is what we're doing.</i>

143
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,106
<i>When you move sideways...</i>

144
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,508
<i>Oh, face forward. Forward.</i>

145
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:03,910
<i>Forward, B side.</i>

146
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:05,378
<i>Yes, okay.</i>

147
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:09,649
<i>This is what we're doing,
so you'll get cut off if you sway.</i>

148
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:10,816
<i>So try not to sway.</i>

149
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,018
<i>Okay.</i>

150
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,454
<i>Why their positions
were directed in detail</i>

151
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:17,890
<i>were due to these features.</i>

152
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,159
<i>Clean positions please.</i>

153
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,227
<i>Yes.</i>

154
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:22,128
NANIWA DANSHI

155
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:38,778
<i>Uh, two points.</i>

156
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:41,681
<i>Um, what Onishi said earlier
about passing in front...</i>

157
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,015
<i>Yes.</i>

158
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:46,452
<i>For that, the leader's better in front.
Is behind him okay?</i>

159
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:47,787
<i>I'll pass behind him.</i>

160
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:48,688
<i>-Okay.
-Yes.</i>

161
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:52,191
<i>And was it Takahashi
when Onishi was singing on top?</i>

162
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,793
<i>-Yes.
-In the lower front?</i>

163
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:59,699
<i>For there, can you slightly shift half
your body weight over to the left please?</i>

164
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,067
<i>Uh, okay.</i>

165
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:03,869
<i>Um, because when we're taking
Onishi's shot,</i>

166
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,272
<i>you overlap him slightly.</i>

167
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:07,840
<i>-Yes, okay.
-Yeah.</i>

168
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:09,942
<i>-Just those two points.
-Yes.</i>

169
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:14,814
<i>No matter how detailed the moves are,
they are never half-hearted.</i>

170
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:18,517
We should at least
confirm the traffic line.

171
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:23,255
That's true, but even if you suggest
this and that, I'm on the very outside.

172
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:25,858
-Yeah.
-Right? The most.

173
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:27,760
I can't get in.

174
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:31,063
-Um, Kento...
-If I go in at 0,5, I won't reach in 0,5.

175
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,798
And I'll be shown.

176
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:41,941
<i>For the oldest member, Fujiwara,
there was a phrase he cherished.</i>

177
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:49,548
I saw Mr. Nakai on TV saying,

178
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:56,389
"The time to bloom depends
on that person," to Snow Man.

179
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:58,658
I thought, "That's amazing. Wow."

180
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:02,762
He said that the time to bloom
is different for each person,

181
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,664
so don't rush and keep working.

182
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,166
That really touched my heart.

183
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:08,668
I see.

184
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:15,007
<i>And now, Ohashi and Michieda's turn came.</i>

185
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:41,767
<i>"Just like our seniors,
continuing to stand on this stage."</i>

186
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:46,505
<i>That is Michieda's dream.</i>

187
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:58,684
I was tense the whole time.

188
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:04,690
I want to do my best at tomorrow's
concert, so that I have no regrets.

189
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:10,563
<i>Meanwhile, Nishihata was
notified of some news.</i>

190
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:13,666
I was just told earlier.

191
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:17,970
Yeah, just earlier, Matsumoto told me.

192
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:19,071
Really.

193
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:21,741
He's like, "I'm gonna
have you say it last."

194
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:22,975
What?!

195
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:26,078
So, I still have time to mentally prepare.

196
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:27,113
It's here.

197
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:28,347
<i>He was assigned</i>

198
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:32,451
<i>the role to introduce the last song
of the concert, "smile."</i>

199
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:37,022
No pressure. Though it's a vital part.

200
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,960
Hey, hey, what are you saying?
You trying to put pressure on me?

201
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:43,662
Dai, if you mess up, "smile" won't begin.

202
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:46,031
Gosh, this is a big responsibility.

203
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,767
Suddenly. It came suddenly.

204
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:48,701
It's a vital...

205
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,470
I'm super happy though.
I'm ultra happy though.

206
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:54,540
{\an8}DECEMBER 30, 2021

207
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,776
{\an8}<i>And the day of the concert came.</i>

208
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:58,878
{\an8}<i>An audience of 40,000 people.</i>

209
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:06,719
{\an8}<i>The collaboration
with their seniors began.</i>

210
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:27,039
{\an8}"KOIFURU TSUKIYONI KIMIOMOU"

211
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:30,276
{\an8}REN NAGASE
KANSAI JOHNNY'S JR. UNTIL 2015

212
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:33,379
{\an8}SHO HIRANO
KANSAI JOHNNY'S JR. UNTIL 2015

213
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:36,649
They're amazing.

214
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:43,789
<i>They'll finally stand
on the same stage as their friends</i>

215
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:46,292
<i>who once worked together toward debuting.</i>

216
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:49,962
It must be a view we've never seen.

217
00:13:56,669 --> 00:14:01,574
<i>Onishi was watching the seniors
who inspired him to become an idol.</i>

218
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:25,631
{\an8}"MUSEKININ HERO"
KANJANI8

219
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,577
<i>Naniwa Danshi's turn was approaching.</i>

220
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:47,753
<i>Finally, it was Naniwa Danshi's turn.</i>

221
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,622
Good, good...

222
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:50,656
Let's have fun!

223
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,258
Now, everyone, gather.

224
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:54,793
We're last, there's lots of our seniors,

225
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,830
but let's send
Naniwa Danshi's "Ubu LOVE" out.

226
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,198
-Yes!
-Here we go!

227
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:00,833
All right!

228
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:07,673
<i>A special feature had been
prepared just for them.</i>

229
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:14,046
<i>Now, continuing on, I'd like to introduce
our juniors who've newly joined in 2021.</i>

230
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:15,948
<i>Please take a look.</i>

231
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:30,996
<i>Each of the seven members' names and faces
were unveiled at Tokyo Dome's grand stage.</i>

232
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:41,707
NANIWA DANSHI

233
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:47,513
{\an8}"UBU LOVE"

234
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:13,806
{\an8}NANIWA DANSHI FORMED IN 2018

235
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:17,476
{\an8}WHILE WORKING TOWARDS THEIR DEBUT,
THEY CLASHED AT TIMES

236
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,982
We're a group.

237
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:25,351
So I hope the message gets across.

238
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:31,757
{\an8}2020, THE PANDEMIC
THE GROUP FACED DANGER...

239
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,860
I get frustrated
when I think it's the pandemic's fault.

240
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:43,635
{\an8}THEY POLISH THEMSELVES,
BELIEVING THERE'S A PATH BEYOND IT

241
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:45,337
I'll always travel.

242
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:47,206
{\an8}Ready, get set...

243
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:50,209
{\an8}2021, THE DAY HAD FINALLY ARRIVED

244
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:52,411
{\an8}JULY 28

245
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:33,085
{\an8}"DIAMOND SMILE"

246
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:59,378
<i>Now, this is the last song.</i>

247
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:04,683
<i>I pray that everyone's lives
will continue to be filled with smiles.</i>

248
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:23,268
<i>Five...</i>

249
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:25,838
<i>And the following day, New Year's Eve.</i>

250
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:28,407
<i>Two, one...</i>

251
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:33,979
{\an8}<i>Happy New Year! 2022!</i>

252
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:35,881
{\an8}JANUARY 1, 2022

253
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,217
{\an8}<i>The year 2022,</i>

254
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:43,555
<i>as they head toward a future path
that no one has walked before,</i>

255
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,824
<i>the seven of them set out.</i>

256
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:49,595
It was brilliant.

257
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:54,066
I was able to feel that we moved
onto the next stage.

258
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:57,569
{\an8}<i>Joichiro Fujiwara.</i>

259
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:01,306
{\an8}<i>He aims to be both an idol and comedian.</i>

260
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,444
{\an8}<i>The leader, Kazuya Ohashi.</i>

261
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:09,948
{\an8}<i>He leads the group higher
with his singing and dancing.</i>

262
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:14,720
Um, for our next goal
we probably want to do it here.

263
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:17,489
We want to do it at Kyocera too.
The Dome Tour...

264
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:20,759
{\an8}<i>Kento Nagao.</i>

265
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:24,496
{\an8}<i>He'll absorb everything he can
to open up a new world.</i>

266
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:27,466
{\an8}Oh, they let us use half.

267
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:29,301
Possibilities?

268
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,604
Well, aren't they limitless?
I mean, you know...

269
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:36,074
People have the power to think.

270
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:39,278
I'd like us to create things
others haven't yet.

271
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:44,449
We were able to dance "Ubu LOVE"
in front of our fans for the first time,

272
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,285
so I was glad for that.

273
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:50,689
It was very fun, and it
became great experience too.

274
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,792
{\an8}<i>Kyohei Takahashi.</i>

275
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:58,063
{\an8}<i>He wishes for their song
to reach everyone.</i>

276
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:03,101
{\an8}<i>Ryusei Onishi.</i>

277
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:07,372
{\an8}<i>He shifted from an admirer to the admired.</i>

278
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:13,078
Having this excitement
of what we'll do next

279
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,647
as we work is a real joy.

280
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:20,385
I hope that this excitement
always continues,

281
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:22,654
imagining what kind of work we'll do.

282
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:26,058
{\an8}<i>Shunsuke Michieda.</i>

283
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:29,595
{\an8}<i>An idol and actor,
he walks down both paths.</i>

284
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:35,067
{\an8}I was able to walk the ideal path
that I imagined.

285
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:37,769
So I'd like to continue that
without wavering.

286
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:41,540
Every person who is precious to me.

287
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:45,777
Like my friends and family.

288
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:50,382
People I'm indebted to.
They're all watching me.

289
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:53,785
So I can show them the good,
cool parts of me,

290
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:55,454
I would like to work hard.

291
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:59,825
{\an8}<i>Continuing on to an unseen world,</i>

292
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:02,294
{\an8}<i>Daigo Nishihata.</i>

293
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:03,695
Do you enjoy life?

294
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,864
I do enjoy my life.

295
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:11,637
Whatever people may say,
my life is my own life.

296
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:17,809
{\an8}They say you only live once.

297
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:21,480
{\an8}Tokyo Dome, good job!

298
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:23,181
{\an8}Good job!

299
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:24,249
{\an8}Good job, everyone!

300
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:26,118
{\an8}Thank you very much!

301
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:27,085
{\an8}See you again!

302
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:28,120
{\an8}Excuse us!

303
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:29,721
{\an8}Please excuse us!

304
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:32,924
And camera.

305

<i>The next episode is on SixTONES.</i>

306
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:42,934
<i>Nearly two years since their debut,
the six of them each spill their thoughts.</i>

307
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:46,038
After a year passes,
just spirit doesn't cut it.

308
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:48,373
Like, is there a need to lie to you guys?

309
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,641
Then why do you lie?

310
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,810
No, I'm not lying.

311
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:54,446
Baby! Baby!

312
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:03,255
We have to take good care of our fans.

313
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:10,128
We think it's just a bluff
that those people created.
