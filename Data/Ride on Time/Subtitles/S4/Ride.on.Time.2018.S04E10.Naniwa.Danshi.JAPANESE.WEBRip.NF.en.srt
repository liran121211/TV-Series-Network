LYRICS

00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:11,444
<i>"How long have I dreamed for."</i>

{\an8}<i>"Time View ~Hatenaku Tsuzuku Michi~."</i>

5
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:24,157
{\an8}<i>The days when they dreamed
about making their debut as idols.</i>

6
00:00:26,726 --> 00:00:31,564

Like, "Days that were hard to swallow."

9
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:40,306
I'm sure there were many days
the seven of us weren't satisfied.

10
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:44,878
I wondered, "Do we have no choice
but to continue in show business?"

11
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:46,646
I'm a not a great talker...

12
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:50,550
but this is how we show
what we're thinking.

13
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:52,886
How do I put this? Something like that.

14
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:57,357
I did think,
"Oh, I'm glad I wrote something."

15
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:01,895
<i>When I felt worried,</i>

16
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:04,964
<i>there were always my members beside me.</i>

17
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:08,735
<i>"Even if I'm about to break,
when I look over, you're with me."</i>

THREE YEARS OF WORKING TOWARD THEIR DEBUT

26
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:10,463
Well, I'm not that young either,

27
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,601
so if I lose this, to be honest,
I have nothing...

28
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:18,204
Yeah, nothing left.

29
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,916
<i>That moment had arrived</i>

30
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:32,886

Let's go!

34
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:46,466
-Wow.
-Let's go!

35
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:47,767
-Wow.
-Good morning!

36
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:50,503
Good morning!

37
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,605
Wow, it's big!

38
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,477
Cool, it's a diamond!

39
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,215
<i>At this moment,</i>

40
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:05,852
<i>the seven of them had not been notified
of their debut yet.</i>

41
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:10,323
<i>Now, the members will scatter
to their spots.</i>

42
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:14,894
<i>The big stage where Naniwa Danshi's
abilities will be put to the test.</i>

was the group's center role,</i>

44
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:20,066
{\an8}<i>Daigo Nishihata.</i>

45
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:21,267
{\an8}It's very big.

46
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:22,202
{\an8}Huh?

47
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:24,871
{\an8}This place is big, yes.

48
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:27,307
{\an8}It's different when you come to the site.

49
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:28,908
{\an8}It's spacious too.

50
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:34,714
And you get really amped up too.

51
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:37,951
How many will fit in here?

52
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:43,856
{\an8}<i>One of the youngest members with
an innocent character is Kento Nagao.</i>

53
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:45,425
{\an8}You haven't heard?

54
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:48,061
{\an8}Oh, Jo, how many fit in here?

55
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:50,196
-Fit what?
-People.

56
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:51,598
Four can fit the bath.

57
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:52,498
Four?

58
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:53,933
Oh, that's tight.

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,835
They say four can fit the bath.

I know I can't eat all of this.

64

I'm an athlete.

65
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:17,056

{\an8}To the outer path and "Seven Stars."

Let's get the audience excited
all the way up to the top.

73
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,411
It's a big slope, so try to look upward.

74
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:39,312
Okay.

75
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:40,546
And the arena too.

76
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:45,118
<i>From eight years old, he has been working
toward his debut for 17 years.</i>

Is your throat okay?

84
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:10,710
Yeah.

85
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:13,079
It's completely fine.

86
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:17,550
Practice like you perform,
perform like you practice.

87
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:21,721
I think we'll do the best we can
and have fun.

88
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,258
<i>And so, their tour began.</i>

89
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,882
Hey, come with us!

90
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:43,169
Now please listen to
"Time View, ~Hatenaku Tsuzuku Michi~."

91
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:51,711
{\an8}<i>The song that Michieda wrote
on Naniwa Danshi's journey up to now.</i>

92
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:26,646
{\an8}<i>The hearts of all the members
were intertwined within this song.</i>

93
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:37,390
{\an8}<i>The moment they discussed that
was that one day.</i>

94
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,958
{\an8}JUNE 27, 2021
DISCUSSION

95
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:41,894
So, probably everything...

96
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:46,833
The lyrics of "Time View"
is speaking for us.

97
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:47,767
Yeah.

98
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:49,836
-Yeah!
-Everything.

99
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:53,606
When you listen to that alone,
doesn't it make you tear up?

100
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:54,874
Yeah, definitely!

101
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:57,009
I do get tears slightly.

102
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:01,414
Well, it's our own song
and it's a song written by our member.

103
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,649
Right, it's a special song.

104
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:06,652
So, you know, it speaks for us.

105
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:09,755
That's our feelings.
Even though Michieda wrote it.

106
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:10,990
Yeah.

107
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:14,427
Wait a second.

108
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,530
His smug face is kind of really...

109
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:19,332
I'm just glad to hear that.

110
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:20,900
Well, it is a good song.

111
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:25,271
I wrote it and did think that maybe
it was a little too direct and all...

112
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,772
No, it's okay. That's good.

113
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,307
That's what's good.

114
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:31,811
I wasn't really confident
about it actually,

115
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:37,450
but if everyone says that's
how you guys feel, I'm glad I wrote it.

116
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:43,289
<i>Because they had a mutual goal
of making their debut,</i>

117
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:46,025
<i>the seven were able to unite their hearts.</i>

118
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:50,396
<i>When a certain phrase is sung,</i>

119
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:53,499
<i>there was something Ohashi
always kept in mind to do.</i>

120
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:58,871
{\an8}EVEN IF I'M ABOUT TO BREAK

121
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:04,477
{\an8}WHEN I LOOK OVER, YOU'RE WITH ME

122
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:06,779
<i>In "Time View,"</i>

123
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:10,516
<i>that line that says,
"When I look over, you're with me."</i>

124
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,785
I do look over, yes.

125
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:14,487
I'm singing, "When I look over,"

126
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:18,157
so when I look, I'm like,
"Who's there? Oh, it's my members."

127
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:22,328
They won't look at me.
No one looks at me though.

128
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,596
You noticed that?

129
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,567
I know they definitely notice!

130
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:30,269
They notice, but they won't look this way.

131
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,072
I don't want them to glare at me,

132
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:35,207
but I want them to glance this way.

133
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:38,411
If they do, I'll probably get goosebumps.

134
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,881
I'm gonna state it here,
everyone's review.

135
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,151
I want them to tell me how they feel, so...

136
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:55,561
{\an8}JULY 27-28, 2021
YOKOHAMA ARENA

137
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:58,097
{\an8}<i>The moment finally arrived.</i>

138
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,202
Good morning!

139
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,371
Good morning!

140
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,040
<i>The Yokohama Arena,
including their seniors,</i>

141
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:12,244
<i>is a stage where many
famous artists have performed.</i>

142
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:13,779
Anyone interesting there?

143
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:16,182
Well, everyone is amazing.

144
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:17,583
Incredible.

145
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:23,489
<i>Nishihata was moved in a different way.</i>

146
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,126
Exactly two years ago,

147
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:30,162
we've always, um...

148
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:34,266
We've been talking about how we wanted
to do a concert on the day of 728.

149
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:38,371
It's already the day of 728
before we even knew it!

150
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:40,339
Oh, it is the day of 728.

151
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:41,574
It is!

152
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:46,345
<i>Even at this point,
they had not been notified of anything.</i>

153
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:49,315
<i>The waiting room was just like normal.</i>

154
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,384
Mr. Ohashi, what's that? Your feet.

155
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,452
These are one-tooth <i>geta</i> sandals.

156
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,623
When I was dancing before,
I felt that I wobbled a bit.

157
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:01,260
I thought I needed more strength,
so I felt I should wear these.

158
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:06,132
It gave me a ton of muscle here!

159
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:11,971
There were problems
with the reception and connectivity,

160
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:16,842
so this time, we had them modify
the ones we've been using.

161
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:19,211
The difference between this and that

162
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:23,716
is that it's rubber here,
so it acts as slip resistance...

163
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:27,953
<i>The modified headset.</i>

164
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:29,922
It's a little arched.

165
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:31,390
Oh, this is really nice!

166
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:33,693
It's perfect. Look!

167
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,429
-Was there a dance like that?
-Yes, there is.

168
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:38,864
-But we'll do this.
-Definitely like this.

169
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:41,701
The distance here
will be quite spaced out.

170
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:43,335
It fits perfect!

171
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:46,806
The Yokohama Arena is large,
so its outer path is stretched out.

172
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:47,707
Yes.

173
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:54,513
The length of the path from the main stage
to center stage is twice that of Sendai.

174
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,550
-Yes.
-So the travel time will be longer.

175
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:01,253
Um, so please run on your own
at those moments.

176
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,190
Jeez, that's tough.
Our legs will be in pain.

177
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:05,091
Let's try it.

178
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:06,459
Okay, let's do it.

179
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:11,197
Because the C Stage side's
outer path is very wide.

180
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:13,666
Oh, I'm sorry,
the main stage side is wide.

181
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:17,670
<i>To the audience filled
to the corners of this large hall,</i>

182
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:21,207
<i>the seven of them must deliver
their hearts to everybody.</i>

183
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,945
<i>The second day of Yokohama,</i>

184
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:02,348
<i>that moment finally arrived.</i>

185
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:07,620
Kansai Johnny's Jr., KanJani8, WEST were
with us before, but we're solo this time.

186
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:10,422
The day of 728,
let's keep this day in our hearts.

187
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:13,626
Today, Naniwa Danshi,
let's make lots of our fans happy!

188
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:15,427
-Let's go!
-Hey!

189
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:23,369
<i>They've worked frantically</i>

190
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:28,507
<i>and reached July 28th at last.</i>

191
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:38,984
My body's very flexible,
so I'd like to show you right now!

192
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:40,319
The kanji for "ground"!

193
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:41,887
And now, "stop"!

194
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:43,956
-Yay!
-For real!

195
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:48,694
<i>It happened midway through the concert
during the talking segment.</i>

196
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,600
-That scared me.
-Huh? What?

197
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,634
An EKG.

198
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:56,802
An EKG.

199
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:01,340
DEBUT CD SET FOR RELEASE!

200
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:21,594
<i>A CD debut from Kansai Johnny's Jr.
hasn't been decided</i>

201
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,330
<i>since JOHNNY'S WEST's seven years ago.</i>

202
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:27,233
All right!

203
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:38,177
I'm glad. Seriously, I'm so glad!
Seriously!

204
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:40,112
Honestly, thank you so much!

205
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:44,183
Thank you so much!

206
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:47,753
Did you imagine this at all?

207
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,189
I did have a slight expectation,
of course.

208
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:52,691
But that's every performance.

209
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:56,028
I'm at my limit.

210
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:58,697
My eyes will be puffy by next performance.

211
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,902
It's okay.

212
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:12,444
<i>The seven who knew nothing about
each other when they were first grouped</i>

213
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:14,513
<i>shed tears together.</i>

214
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,049
All right.

215
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:19,585
Thank you.

216
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:21,987
All right.

217
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,793
It was so long,
seventeen and a half years.

218
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:34,066
"Time View" is gonna be hard.

219
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:41,674
Plus, the lyrics are,
"How long have I dreamed for."

220
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:45,110
"Those days when I thought
it would never come true."

221
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:50,015
"I'd remember
and pretend not to think about it."

222
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:54,053
But now, that's a reality.

223
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,755
I have to thank Micchi.

224
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:14,773
{\an8}"TIME VIEW ~HATENAKU TSUZUKU MICHI~"

225
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:32,738
Thank you, it was good.

226
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:34,206
I'm so glad.

227
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:35,107
Oh, don't cry.

228
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,275
I'm so happy.

229
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,709
I'm really happy myself.

230
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,645
Thank you.

231
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:42,281
But it'll be even harder from here.

232
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,482
That's true.

233
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:45,784
Well, we'll work hard.

234
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:47,920
Good work!

235
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:50,522
<i>To celebrate the members,</i>

236
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:52,591
<i>a good friend had rushed over.</i>

237
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:53,926
Good work.

238
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,896
Yeah!

239
00:19:57,963 --> 00:19:59,064
{\an8}Good work.

240
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:01,767
{\an8}<i>A member of Snow Man,</i>

241
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,101
{\an8}<i>Koji Mukai.</i>

242
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:04,369
{\an8}Can you wait here?

243
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:07,839
<i>They spent their days together
at Kansai Johnny's Jr.,</i>

244
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:10,075
<i>a friend who aimed for the same goal.</i>

245
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:10,976
Hey!

246
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:11,877
Yeah!

247
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:13,912
-Muka-chan!
-Good work!

248
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:15,214
I came for the encore.

249
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,181
Oh, seriously?

250
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:20,485
Good work!

251
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:23,956
Anyhow, I'm just happy for them.

252
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:26,425
I teared up during Daigo's speech too.

253
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:30,028
To me right now, like...

254
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:33,899
How do you say this?
They're a presence that inspires me.

255
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:36,535
How do I put this?

256
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:42,107
What I kind of imagined
or what was built up here inside me

257
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,010
feels like it all disappeared.

258
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:48,213
So I'm now really empty in a good way.

259
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:52,784
I think I'll restart from scratch
and work hard.

260
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:54,219
Thank you.

261
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:55,187
Thank you.

262
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,422
To be honest,

263
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,592
when I wrote "Time View"...

264
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:07,833
Of course it holds the feelings
of us seven too.

265
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:11,370
But I wrote this
so we can cry while singing it.

266
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,238
Really.

267
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:15,407
"Time View" was very nice.

268
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:21,146
I'm glad we were able to sing it
as we cried.

269
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:26,551
The lyrics didn't sink
into the crowd though.

270
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,954
They probably couldn't make out the words.

271
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,658
Since we were all bawling while singing.

272
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:35,260
But even still,

273
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:40,866
the fans were intently watching us
while they cried.

274
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:43,969
So I thought,
"I'm glad I joined Johnny's."

275
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:47,973
{\an8}<i>Next time,</i>

276
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,877
{\an8}<i>the surprising feelings flooding
the debuting Naniwa Danshi.</i>

277
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:55,180
{\an8}I'm more worried now.

278
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:56,348
{\an8}It's contradictory.

279
00:21:56,415 --> 00:22:00,952
{\an8}I wanted to debut, so I worked
for it, but I get scared once it's final.

280
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:06,358
{\an8}<i>What is demanded
of them grows bigger by the day.</i>

281
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:11,096
{\an8}The picture seen after debuting
will become different, definitely.

282
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:14,132
{\an8}<i>How does the picture look from their eyes?</i>

283
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:16,935
