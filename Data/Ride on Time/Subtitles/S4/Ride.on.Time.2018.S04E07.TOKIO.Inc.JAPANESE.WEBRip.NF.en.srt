Make up is everything.

57
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:22,669
It's everything for acting,
be it a period piece or cross-dressing.

58
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:24,904
Yeah, that surprised me.

59
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:26,439
-Oh really?
-Yes.

60
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:27,807
I do it all by myself.

61
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,842
-Seems like it.
-Yeah.

62
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,946
Period dramas have their own style.

63
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:35,615
Women have their own unique style too.

64
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:36,749
I see.

65
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:41,588
I learned that it's very tough
if you have somebody else do it for you.

66
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:42,822
Yeah.

67
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:49,128
The Kyoto staff as well as
the older actors taught me that.

68
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:53,199
When you're performing concerts as TOKIO,
do you do your own make up?

69
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:55,301
We're bare-faced for our concerts.

70
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:57,270
Yeah.

71
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:59,205
No one wears make up?

72
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:01,841
That's right, no one in TOKIO wears any.

73
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:03,776
At a concert?

74
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:06,012
-I didn't know that.
-Nope, not at all.

75
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:07,513
Nope.

76
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,784
-We don't have make up artists around.
-I've always wondered about that.

77
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:16,322
For programs on location
like <i>THE TETSUWAN DASH</i>

78
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:20,627
there may be some around
but they're for the other groups.

79
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:23,162
-I see.
-TOKIO doesn't have any.

80
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:26,966
I've always thought
idol groups would have them.

81
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:29,702
That's one thing that makes us different.

82
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,672
It's off because I was talking.

83
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:34,507
-Sorry.
-Don't worry about it.

84
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:36,242
I was the one talking.

85
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:46,452
-It's okay, you can sit there.
-Thank you.

00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:51,658

00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,364
North is this way.

89
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:12,245
It's 15 to 20 minutes before the start.

90

91
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:17,417
Mr. Kon.

92
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,786
Yes, Director Kon Satoshi.

93
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:23,723
He was originally from Hokkaido, like me.

94
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:27,927
I was originally a big fan of this work.

95
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:32,131
He was like a god to me.

96
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:36,602
That's why I prayed to him today.

97
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:37,804
I do it every time,

98
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:39,939
facing north.

99
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:45,445
Do you remember
the first time you made a prayer?

100
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:48,781
-A Prayer?
-Yes.

101
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:56,222
It was before I entered the industry.

102
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:57,824
Yeah.

103
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:02,929
Have you ever held your breath
while driving through a tunnel?

104
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:06,632
Maybe not anymore.
In the past we used to hold our breath.

105
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:12,572
"If I can hold my breath
until I get out of this tunnel,

106
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:15,241
I'll make it into Johnny's."
I did that a lot.

107
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:18,344
I did that for a good two years.

108
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:22,248
-Okay, I'll get going.
-Okay.

<i>Now they must find a partner

Take a look at this one again.

120
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:13,266
It's important to first read
everything thoroughly.

121
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:14,200
Yes.

122
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:17,270
The platform will be
chosen after this, correct?

123
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:19,472

Yeah.

148
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:51,664
What should I do so that
people remember me as TOKIO's Matsuoka?

149
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,366
I tried and did many things.

150
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:55,735
This is what happened.

151
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:58,304
Even though it was Johnny&Associates,Inc.

152
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,007
I wore sunglasses and spiked my hair.

153
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:05,912
People were thinking,
"Who the hell is that?"

154
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:09,181
But when that happened,
they actually remembered me.

155
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,485
It's a win for us if they remember us.

156
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:16,389
Have you ever been scared
you would be pressured to conform?

157
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:20,126
I'm the type to think,
"If you don't act, nothing will happen."

158
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,930
So I'll just have to be stronger then.

159
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:28,167
This is really embarrassing to say

160
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:34,507
but I'm a coward, so it hurts my feelings
when people look down on me.

161
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:38,444
That's the only reason.

162
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:42,481
I don't look down on anybody.

163
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:46,986
But I'm stupid and a coward.

164
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:49,655
It's just bad if somebody
looks down on me.

165
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:52,725
That's how I've dealt with it
this whole time.

166
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:54,527
Yeah.

167
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,429
Do you think yourself a coward?

168
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:58,297
Of course. Very much a coward.

169
00:09:58,364 --> 00:09:59,865
I'm like a Pomeranian.

170
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,368

171
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,838

172
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:07,974

00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:22,855
<i>Matsuoka paved his own way
as an actor after that.</i>

176
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:32,898
<i>He has rules he set himself
when comes to acting on stage.</i>

177
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:40,973
This is very brazen of me,

178
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:45,244
but I told myself I wouldn't do theater
until I became famous.

179
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:51,117
If they don't know who I am,
I don't want people coming.

180
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,252
I wouldn't like that.

181
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,122
Coming to see the play knowing who I am,

182
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:59,058
versus coming to see the play
without knowing me.

183
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:04,497
I won't go on stage
if I haven't made a name for myself.

184
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:09,301
I didn't want to become
an actor or a pop idol.

185
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:14,840
I wasn't the type of person
who wanted to succeed in music.

186
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:19,445
I wanted to become famous.

187
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,713
That's who I am.

188
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,117
Thank you so much. Sorry to bother you.

189
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,086
Thank you very much. Goodbye.

190
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:29,455
-I watched your drama.
-Thank you.

191
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,923
The one with the maid.

192
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,592
Ah, <i>Mitazono</i>. Thank you for watching.

193
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:35,327
You haven't changed at all.

194
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:38,364
Please wait a moment.

195
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:43,002
I have one <i>Mitazono</i> T-shirt left.
So here you go.

196
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:45,271
-We'll pay for it.
-No please don't.

197
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:49,041
Here you go.
I just ask that you don't sell it.

198
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:51,177
Please take it.

199
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:52,878
Thank you so much.

200
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:54,246
-Thank you again.
-Thank you for coming.

201
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:56,348
Goodbye.

202
00:11:57,349 --> 00:12:00,086
{\an8}JULY
SAITAMA

203
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:02,621
{\an8}-Good morning.
-Hello.

204
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:03,589
Good morning.

205
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:05,091
-Good morning.
-Hello.

206
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:08,327
<i>They're filming a commercial today.</i>

207
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,528
Good morning.

208
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,465
{\an8}COMMERCIAL FILMING FOR
<i>TOMATO EGG CURRY UDON</i>

209
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:15,000
{\an8}<i>The commercial is filmed on location.</i>

210
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:19,138
{\an8}<i>The close-up camera doesn't capture
Matsuoka's expression well.</i>

211
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:20,306
{\an8}Action!

212
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:26,011
<i>The director wants to talk to Matsuoka.</i>

213
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,286
Take a look at this motorhome
since you're here.

214
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:38,390
Impressive ones like these are rare.

215
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,761
I only get to use this
because I'm filming.

216
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:43,262
-Excuse me.
-Come on in.

217
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:46,999
You can see the television over there.

218
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:50,336
There are lunch boxes here.

219
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:51,737
And in the back...

220
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:55,908
I believe this is
supposed to be the bedroom.

221
00:12:55,975 --> 00:13:00,980
I think it was remodeled
and now it's a dressing room.

222
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:04,350
It'd be nice if you could
open these and see the sea.

223
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:07,086
I mean now it's just a highway in Saitama.

224
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:12,158
<i>Matsuoka was kind to let the crew
film for the documentary.</i>

225
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:15,961
I bet this motor home
uses up a lot of gas.

226
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:17,897
Would it be good to rent one?

227
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:20,800
There's a shower and also a toilet.

228
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:22,701
If you include this,

229
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:25,304
they'll think I'm always
looking in the mirror.

230
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,339
Yeah...

231
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:30,976
I mean this is the only place
where you can film me.

232
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:33,145
-Yes.
-Right.

233
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:39,552
Where would you choose to debut? Arashi?

234
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:42,087
I mean age-wise.

235
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,290
KanJani8 is definitely younger.

236
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:45,825
But close in age I think.

237
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:47,693
Yeah, Yoko is...

238
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,028
{\an8}-A year younger.
-A year.

239
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:50,462
{\an8}-Murakami too.
-I see.

240
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:53,065
{\an8}<i>Kohara was once
on the same path as Matsuoka</i>

241
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:56,502
<i>but is now working
at an advertising agency.</i>

242
00:13:57,002 --> 00:14:00,472
C<i>oincidentally, he was
in charge of this commercial.</i>

243
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:05,044
Why did you decide
to work for an advertising firm?

244
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,213
-Why an advertising firm?
-Wow...

245
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,381
This is like an interview.

246
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:11,650
It's good to see it from the outside.

247
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:12,618
Ah.

248
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,854
People who quit the industry

249
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,323
Be it actors or musicians

250
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:20,659
they're able to understand
how it feels to step away.

251
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:23,429
They can objectively see
what's not enough.

252
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:25,364
It's great if they come back.

253
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:29,935
If I tried to re-examine myself
there wouldn't be a place for me anymore.

254
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:32,271
I'll come running back.

255
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,073
Just a little.

256
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:37,977
For three days I'll be immersed in myself,

257
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:41,080
and by the fourth day
I'll contact the staff.

258
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:43,048
"So about the next drama..."

259
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:44,950
You'll say, "Can I come back?"

260
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:46,318
It's just a holiday.

261
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,353
Yeah.

262
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:49,555
What am I saying on this program?

263
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:56,362
Yeah, it's very important.
Don't take this for granted.

264
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,731
Who is this for?

265
00:14:58,797 --> 00:14:59,999
Myself.

266
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:03,135
Are you ready?

267
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:05,037
-Yes.
-Okay, let's start.

268
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:09,675
<i>Walking straight ahead
on the path he chose.</i>

269
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:17,116
{\an8}Taichi Kokubun's <i>Radio Box</i>.

270
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:23,722
"When I hit the accelerator,
my mouth goes, 'vroooom.'"

271
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:28,460
I haven't done this in a long time.

272
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:34,767
<i>The vice president of TOKIO Inc.,
Kokubun, keeps getting busier by the day.</i>

273
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,435
I might just do it now too.

274
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:41,907
Your bag looks heavy today too.

275
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:45,945
Yeah, this is today's load.
I have a lot of stuff in here.

276
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:48,981
There's documents for
the company and the Olympics.

277
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:50,215
Yeah.

278
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:53,018
-Good work.
-Good work.

279
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:54,486
Good work everyone.

280
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,691
-Hello.
-Hi.

281
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:02,127
<i>Kokubun arrives at an event
held by an IT company.</i>

282
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:04,964
-Wow.
-Yeah.

283
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,666
I'll take you to the waiting room.

284
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:12,338
<i>Ever since they started the company,
there's two things Kokubun always carries.</i>

285
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:16,675
Hello, excuse me.

286
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:21,380
-Thank you for the other day.
-Thank you. We met on the remote call.

287
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:25,851
<i>The first thing is his business card.</i>

288
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:29,621
<i>The other is...</i>

289
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:30,990
May I have this?

290
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:32,257
Which size would you like?

291
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,193
-This please.
-That one? Sure.

292
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:36,061
{\an8}-I'll put it on my PC.
-Please do.

293
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:37,463
{\an8}-Can I have one?
-Sure.

294
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:39,131
{\an8}-May I have one?
-Of course.

295
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:42,634
{\an8}-Can I have one more?
-Pardon me for being faddist.

296
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:44,403
{\an8}Please excuse me.

297
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:51,944
<i>What's important is that
people remember the TOKIO Inc. name.</i>

298
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:55,314
I just made these stickers on my own.

299
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:04,723
<i>Kokubun has plans with a friend tonight.</i>

300
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,795
-Pardon the intrusion.
-Hi.

301
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:11,930
-Hey.
-Hey there.

302
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:12,865
Sorry about this.

303
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:15,467
{\an8}<i>His best friend since his younger years,</i>

304
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,202
{\an8}<i>Yoshihiko Inohara.</i>

305
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:23,575
{\an8}<i>Inohara was the first person Kokubun told
about his idea of starting a company.</i>

306
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:26,245
{\an8}Yeah, my line of vision was like this.

307
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:28,147
Right? I knew you would remember.

308
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:30,849
Cheers.

309
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,152
-Long time no see.
-Same here.

310
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:37,189
<i>They reminisce about their earlier years.</i>

311
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:38,390
That tastes good.

312
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:41,293
Remember the baseball tournament?

313
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,863
All the main players
were trying to take a group photo.

314
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,833
The PR people were like,
"Please stand here."

315
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,102
"The center's so and so."

316
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:55,441
And every single time,
we were in the back just hanging out.

317
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:58,510
They took the picture
and I was laughing with this guy.

318
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:01,747
"We're the goldfish poop
of Johnny&Associates,Inc.

319
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:04,917
Always just clinging on."
We always laughed about it.

320
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:07,386
-That was the beginning.
-Yeah.

321
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:09,955
Taichi once told me something.

322
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:15,094
He said he found a way
to stay in the industry for a long time.

323
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,229
I asked him, "What? What's that?"

324
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:19,398
"Just cling on to somebody."

325
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,734
I said, "Oh, I see!"

326
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:24,503
That's what he said.

327
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:28,340
<i>Thirty years have passed since then.</i>

328
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:30,943
-From rehearsal...
-Yeah.

329
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:35,614
<i>Inohara was worried about
the new first steps Kokubun took.</i>

330
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,451
What did the other members say?

331
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:42,521
Not a lot of opportunities
come at the right time.

332
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:45,591
Let's go back and stand at the start line.

333
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:51,396
Show people our sweat,
blood and tears at our age.

334
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,731
It might...

335
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:56,768
be something that adds to our lives.

336
00:18:56,835 --> 00:19:01,707
When I told them that,
they said, "That sounds interesting."

337
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:03,809
They understood what I was saying.

338
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:05,010
Yeah, I see...

339
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:08,046
You're always happy for me
when I'm on specials.

340
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:13,619
<i>The three members realized something big
when they were in talks with each other.</i>

341
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:20,192
I always thought I knew
what they wanted to say instinctively.

342
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:24,463
But if they hadn't told me,
I wouldn't have known.

343
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:27,499
I realized I didn't know
what they don't like,

344
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:29,134
or what they're thinking.

345
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:32,004
I won't know if they don't say it.

346
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,039
There's lots we don't know.

347
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:35,007
Yeah, exactly.

348
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:38,544
Even though you've
been with the group for 20 years...

349
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:42,314
Exactly. You'd think you knew.
That's why I thought I knew.

350
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:43,382
Right, right.

351
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:46,285
I realized we should vocalize some things.

352
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,186
I see.

353
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:50,622
Matsuoka said something very wise to me.

354
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:54,993
"Staying in the company
and trying to do something new.

355
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,663
That's what we should work on."

356
00:19:57,729 --> 00:20:01,567
It's because of what he said
that I started to think deeper.

357
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:06,838
Staying in your comfort zone
while trying something new.

358
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:11,410
I think that's a valid way of life too.

359
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:17,316
I think it's a catalyst
to start thinking about things.

360
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,084
-Yeah, you're right.
-Yeah.

361
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:24,256
I don't think Mr. Johnny
would have ever imagined

362
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:28,327
you would actually
start a company named TOKIO Inc.

363
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:29,228
Yeah...

364
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:32,664
I believe he would have
left it in your hands,

365
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:38,670
and happily cheer you on as you
did something that he didn't envision.

366
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:42,808
I think he would say, "TOKIO is amazing."

367
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:44,910
-I hope so.
-I'm sure of it.

368
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:47,512
He would say, "I didn't think of that."

369
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:51,350
We're moving ahead but
we don't know if what we're doing is right

370
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,986
-It's fine if the outcome's good.
-Yeah.

371
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:55,921
Can I go pee? May I?

372
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:56,955
Shall I go too?

373
00:20:57,022 --> 00:21:00,092
Let's go together.
Don't pee at the same time as me.

374
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:05,464
{\an8}TWO MONTHS SINCE THE START OF THE COMPANY

375
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:08,433
{\an8}<i>During this time, President Joshima...</i>

376
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:12,638
{\an8}Two <i>gyoza</i>, please.

377
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:16,475
{\an8}And can you replace
the white rice with red rice?

378
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:22,447
<i>Now 50 years old, this is his first time
playing the protagonist in a drama.</i>

379
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:28,687
<i>He plays a mother
raising her adolescent son.</i>

380
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:32,224
I brought your side dishes!

381
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,759
Don't come here for that.

382
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:37,095
Side dishes are an important part
of a lunch box.

383
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:43,068
<i>To make the character come alive,
he recalls someone important to him.</i>

384
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:49,708
{\an8}<i>On the next</i> RIDE ON TIME<i>,</i>

385
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:52,377
{\an8}<i>the company president, Shigeru Joshima.</i>

386
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:59,351
{\an8}<i>A 30 year journey that was supported
by memories not known to many.</i>

387
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:04,656
{\an8}I wanted to free myself
from everyday life.

388
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:06,625
If I jump into that spotlight,

389
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:08,994
my life will change.

390
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:15,934
