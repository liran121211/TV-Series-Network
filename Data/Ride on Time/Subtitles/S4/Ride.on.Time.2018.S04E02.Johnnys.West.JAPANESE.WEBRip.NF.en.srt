{\an8}<i>Riatotsu WEST</i> for national television.
This is the first recording.

2
00:00:04,938 --> 00:00:06,106
{\an8}Let's do this guys!

00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:08,141
{\an8}SEPTEMBER
<i>RIATOTSU WEST</i> FILMING LAUNCH

4
00:00:09,976 --> 00:00:12,278
<i>It's been seven years since their debut.</i>

5
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:16,349
<i>Their namesake program will launch
nationwide in October.</i>

6
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:20,420
Haru, what's that over there?

7
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:25,325
<i>Whether in dramas or plays,
the members are continually performing.</i>

8
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:28,862
<i>That energy for performing is unstoppable
for JOHNNY'S WEST.</i>

9
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,096
Ouch!

10
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,969
{\an8}<i>We stayed with the seven of them
for seven months.</i>

11
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:42,175
-What are you doing?
-You made me do it.

12
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:47,747
{\an8}I've always thought that
this group got along the best in Johnny's.

13
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:52,819
I think the other groups find it
a bit weird how well we get along.

14
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:56,589
{\an8}But seeing them
after a long time was fun.

15
00:00:56,656 --> 00:01:03,163
{\an8}That's when I'll realize for
the first time, "This is what I wanted."

16
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:07,700
{\an8}<i>The spotlight has begun
shining on all of them.</i>

17
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:09,736
{\an8}<i>What are they thinking?</i>

18
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:11,971
{\an8}<i>What are their goals?</i>

19
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:14,307
Stop fooling around!

20
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:15,542
Stop...

21
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:18,678
Don't fight during class.

22
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,714
Guys, let's do this right, okay?

23
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:22,982
-Let's do it.
-Yeah.

24
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:23,950
Did you get that?

25
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:50,443
<i>This is documentary series</i> RIDE ON TIME.

26
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:02,088
{\an8}<i>In April 2014,
JOHNNY'S WEST made their debut.</i>

27
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:08,661
{\an8}<i>Their debut song "Eejanaika"
reached first place on the Oricon Chart.</i>

28
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:15,869
{\an8}Today's the first zodiac reunion
in 100 years.

29
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:17,203
I can't watch this!

30
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,440
<i>They've been searching for their own path.</i>

31
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:21,641
No, I can't hold this.

32
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,743
Hey, you're holding it in your hand!

33
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:28,081
{\an8}It's not like we reached
a million sales right away.

34
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,750
{\an8}We've taken it one step at a time.

35
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,987
{\an8}In fact, we've had times
where we stopped progressing.

36
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:39,225
{\an8}<i>But they finally got their chance
to hold two large dome tours last year.</i>

37
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:44,664
{\an8}<i>But with the pandemic,
that dream did not come true.</i>

38
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:46,032
{\an8}OSAKA CONCERT CANCELED

39
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:49,702
{\an8}<i>In addition, there was a seven-city tour
they were supposed to have.</i>

40
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:52,739
{\an8}<i>But the concert in their hometown
Osaka was canceled.</i>

42
00:02:55,975 --> 00:03:01,915
{\an8}<i>Nevertheless, they're looking forward
to a six-city tour with a live audience.</i>

43
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:16,496
We can only do this because of
how well-mannered the audience is.

44
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:17,630
Thank you!

45
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,132
Everyone is helping us.

46
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,534
It feels like everyone
is helping create this.

47
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:26,072
<i>They've safely finished
performing in five cities.</i>

48
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,808
<i>The last one is in Kumamoto.</i>

49
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,810
-Good work.
-Thanks.

50
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,212
Good work, guys.

51
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:38,985

{\an8}Playing the role of Sojiro Aisaka,
this is Takahiro Hamada.

57
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,131
{\an8}Thank you.

TAKAHIRO HAMADA (32)

59
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:57,971
{\an8}This is the opening for
<i>BUSHI-STANT AISAKAKUN!</i>

60
00:03:58,037 --> 00:03:59,939
{\an8}We're starting to film now. Thank you.

61
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:01,274
{\an8}Thank you.

62
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,279
<i>This is Hamada's first main role drama
without his group.</i>

63
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,718
{\an8}<i>The original story is
a popular manga series.</i>

64
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:15,822
{\an8}<i>He plays a</i> shunga <i>painter who has
time warped into present day Japan.</i>

65
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:19,459
{\an8}All right, let's start filming.

66
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:20,526
{\an8}Okay.

67
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:21,427
Okay.

68
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:22,962
Here's the octopus.

69
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:26,833
When somebody's doing well,

70
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,203
it has that good effect on the group.

71
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,272
-Synergistic effect?
-Yeah, that's it!

72
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:34,774
When somebody improves themselves,

73
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:37,810
there's a strong feeling
we have to do better too.

74
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:42,382
I believe everyone in the group
thinks this way.

75
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:45,218
Everyone gets fired up.

76
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:49,422
That was... my first octopus.

77
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:51,658
I got scared during the filming.

78
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:57,997
{\an8}<i>In 2002, when he was
in his second year of middle school.</i>

79
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:00,933
{\an8}<i>Hamada came knocking
on Johnny&Associates,Inc.</i>

80
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:04,804
{\an8}<i>The adorable character he has
all started from this point.</i>

81
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:09,742
<i>The younger members remember
what he was like back then.</i>

82
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:15,581
{\an8}I also happened to be
in the same Junior unit

83
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,784
{\an8}with Hamada when he was young.

84
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:22,689
Hamada said something to me...

85
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:28,094
Even though he's older,
he told me, "Just call me Hama-chan."

86
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,463
That's how it happened.

87
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:34,033
Since I've joined,
I've only called him, "Hama-chan."

88
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,270
{\an8}I've never used polite language
since we've debuted.

89
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,505
{\an8}We always used "kun"
with Akito and Junta.

90
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:41,774
But Hama-chan has always been "Hama-chan."

91
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,944
That's what makes him amazing.

92
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,045
He's got talent.

93
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:50,450
If I needed to talk to someone,
it would probably be Hama-chan.

94
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:54,087
He's easy to talk to
and easy to get advice from.

95
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:55,455
He's a great listener.

96
00:05:57,457 --> 00:06:00,827
<i>An adorable character
and the life of the party.</i>

97
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:05,398
<i>This was taken during their break.</i>

98
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:27,420
Let's start already.

99
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:31,391
<i>This is right before
their concert started.</i>

100
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,167
Running away
from the behind-the-scenes people.

101
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:47,507
<i>Even during the concert...</i>

102
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,314
Ferrari.

103
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:00,620
<i>There was also this side of him.</i>

104
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:02,989
Our live tour <i>rainboW</i> starts now!

105
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:06,526
Let me introduce one of our buddies!

106
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:20,039

{\an8}<i>However, performing in both
concerts and a drama</i>

112
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:44,564
{\an8}<i>took a toll on Hamada's body.</i>

113
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:47,433
-Is it bad?
-Yeah.

114
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,669
You should tell them
you strained your back.

115
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:52,238
If you're going to say it, say so now.

116
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:55,775
"I'm sorry for worrying you. I'm okay."
You should tell them yourself.

117
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:58,044
They must have realized,
so you should tell them.

118
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,413
-Go out there and tell them.
-Yeah, I agree.

119
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:05,751
<i>Hamada strained his back
in the middle of the concert.</i>

120
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,457
He's not here, is he?

121
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:15,695
<i>He somehow managed
to pull his part off.</i>

122
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,032
I'm so embarassed.

123
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,936
{\an8}<i>But the next day,
he was back to his drama.</i>

00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:39,485
Okay.

127
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:41,220
-That's good.

00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:57,770
I strained my back yesterday.

135
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:00,806
Yeah, it was fun.

136
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,410
But I'm like, "Why now?"

137
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:06,479
It was a witch's shot.

I'm sorry, I strained my back...

141
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:23,095
Oh really?

142
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:25,798
So just lift it up slowly...

143
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:27,433
-I didn't know that.
-Yep.

144
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,869
Okay, everyone,
please stop what you're doing.

145
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:32,672
Staff members, please come here.

146
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:37,810
I strained my back,

147
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:41,147
so I think they're discussing
whether or not to film tomorrow.

148
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:43,649
I can't believe this is happening now.

149
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:45,885
Seriously.

150
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:52,858

{\an8}JOHNNY'S WEST
DAIKI SHIGEOKA (29)

152
00:09:54,493 --> 00:09:57,563
I was on the same plane
going back with Hama-chan.

153
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,699
I remember it vividly.

154
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:02,201
He got in the manager's car.

155
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,638
I told him,
"Good luck with the drama."

156
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:10,810
Then the window of the car rolled down

157
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:15,181
and he said to me,
"I shall be back!" and left.

158
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:17,416
Things like that.

159
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:22,288
I couldn't say something like that.

160
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:27,126
I'd probably be a little sad.

161
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:32,331
Filming a drama with a bad back
on a very tough schedule.

162
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:34,200
I'd probably sulk a little

163
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:37,737
and be moody because I'd feel restricted.

164
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,939
I'd definitely feel nervous.

165
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:43,843
Despite all that, Hama-chan said,

166
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:47,747
"I shall be back!"
as if nothing was wrong.

167
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:51,951
I've gotten to know
such an awesome guy.

168
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:56,756
That's what I seriously thought to myself.

169
00:10:56,822 --> 00:11:02,928
I have no problems
introducing Hama-chan to other people.

170
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:06,499
Of course,
I could introduce the others too.

171
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:11,003
But Hamada is special.

172
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:16,442
It's like reading through sayings
and famous quotes.

173
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:19,345
What's the one I like?

174
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:23,482
"People who laugh during tough times
are the strongest."

175
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:24,850
It's this quote.

176
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,819
It's like...

177
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:30,423
People who laugh
even though they're mad

178
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:33,059
are stronger
than those who just get mad.

179
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:37,997
It's okay to cry when you're sad,

180
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:45,504
but I read that people who laugh when
they're sad are so much stronger.

181
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:49,642
I think that's how
I developed my own habits.

182
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:55,147
<i>And there's also this man who
takes care of and fights for the group.</i>

190
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:24,677

an exclusive model for five years.</i>

191
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,219
Yes, thank you.

192
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:44,363
To make it onto the green
in one shot in Kawagoe,

193
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:46,866
I'll need an eight or a nine...

194
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,068
Let's go with eight. An 8-iron, please!

195
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,271
Should I uncross my legs?

196
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:53,472
The other way...

197
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,474
Like this?

198
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,376
You want to see the sneakers, huh?

199
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,478
-It's not in frame.
-It's not?!

200
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:07,586
I really don't like doing things in a rush
or workplaces that are tense.

201
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:11,457
Everyone's having fun
chatting and working.

202
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:13,392
Having fun is what matters the most.

203
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:19,598
<i>What matters most to Kotaki are
good relations with the staff.</i>

204
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,535
<i>This applies to other workplaces too.</i>

205
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:26,205
Is that a tour T-shirt?

206
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,507
Yeah. A staff T-shirt?

207
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:31,644
We're working hard
together as a team.

208
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,346
And that includes the staff.

209
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:37,883
That's why...

210
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:43,189
I want to wear the same T-shirt
as everybody else during rehearsals.

211
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:47,426
I want to have fun during rehearsals too.

212
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:52,097

216

{\an8}<i>He was the youngest member in the group,

217
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:19,525
I'm always grateful
to the staff that supports us

218
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:22,928
and the all the fans
who cheer us on.

219
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:26,765
I'd like to repay everyone back.
Please continue to support us.

220
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:29,435
{\an8}The way he thinks
is like a 35-year-old.

221
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:30,669
{\an8}His thought process.

222
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:31,737
{\an8}It's amazing.

225
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,278
{\an8}Very sincere.

226
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:43,949
That level of sincerity
is pretty rare to see.

227
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,652
And he continues to grow.

228
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,754
Kotaki absorbs everything.

229
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:54,860
{\an8}<i>This power to absorb everything
has made him very successful as an actor.</i>

230

{\an8}I'm grateful to have had

235
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:13,812
{\an8}And I'm thankful that
I was a part of this play.

236
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,148
Hello there.

237
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:18,083
Wow...

238
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:22,121
"Should I be here?"
That's what I'm wondering.

239
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:24,857
These people are
the cream of the crop.

240
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:31,797
They're really the people at the top
of the theater community.

241
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:34,533
And here I am. It felt quite strange.

242
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:39,305
{\an8}<i>And this year, Kotaki will be part of
Agatha Christie's original play,</i>

245
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,113
Then...

246
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:53,018
I'm going to do my best to perform
so people compliment me

247
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:55,821
and can say that I was the best.

248
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,358
That's how I feel.

249
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:04,630
<i>What does JOHNNY'S WEST mean to him?</i>

250
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:13,205
I didn't feel helpless then
nor did I feel lonely.

251
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:15,741
But seeing them
after a long time was fun.

252
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:22,114
That's when I'll realize for
the first time, "This is what I wanted."

253
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:27,953
<i>And the group begins
to move in a new direction.</i>

254
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:29,855

This was my first drama by myself.

271

We wouldn't have been able to film

272

such a good drama
without everyone's help.

273
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:24,076
I truly believe this.

It doesn't usually happen.

278
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:48,834
In the past, I would often ask,
"Can we have a tie-in with a song?"

279
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,870
They'd be like, "no, no tie-ins."

280
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:53,305
That's how it would be.

281
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:56,975
I'd always ask just in case.

282
00:17:57,543 --> 00:17:58,877
I'm grateful.

This is the setting, right?

-Right?

Can we talk here?
Or is that not allowed?

303
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:25,330
Specifically speaking, it'd be interesting
if there was this kind of conversation.

304

Just sweep normally like this.

-Yes.

-Sorry, I thought it was practice.
-Wow.

310

-Can we do it again?
-Wow.

311
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:42,281

312
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,415
No, it was our fault!

313

Shigeoka and I were looking
somewhere else.

317
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:53,292
Shigeoka stands out.

318
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,060
I wasn't looking at the right place.

319
