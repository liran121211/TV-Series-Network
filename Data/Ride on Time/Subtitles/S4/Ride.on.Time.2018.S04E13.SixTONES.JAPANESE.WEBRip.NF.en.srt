1
00:00:06,573 --> 00:00:08,274
<i>On this day,</i>

2
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:12,212
<i>they witnessed the love</i>

3
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:15,749
<i>of an audience who had to remain silent.</i>

4
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:29,162
<i>Their name is SixTONES.</i>

5
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:46,746
It used to be a given.

6
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:49,649
Hearing the cheers from an audience.

7
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:55,555
I guess it was trying to get
as many people to think it was cool.

8
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:57,490
Five, six, seven, eight.

9
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:02,562
<i>Music was at the center of their career.</i>

10
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:06,900
<i>They were busy creating
a new album for a concert tour.</i>

11
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:18,144
There are a total of
19 tracks we need to record.

12
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:19,979
I might die.

13
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:26,119
<i>They broke the typical idol mold
to search for a way to express themselves.</i>

14
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,425
This is really hard.

15
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:34,861
I hate my voice.

16
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,529
I love my voice.

17
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,164
I can't change my voice.

18
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:40,600
Maybe I've embraced it.

19
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,676
There are idols who love music

20
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:53,513
and want to express that
from the bottom of their hearts.

21
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,682
When the six of us sing,

22
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:59,085
I'd feel lucky if we have an audience.

23
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:04,891
<i>There are nine months before the concert.</i>

24
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:07,794
I want to be acknowledged even more.

25
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:12,999
<i>We followed them
as they threw themselves into the music.</i>

26
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:40,093
<i>This is documentary series</i> Ride on Time.

27
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:47,600
{\an8}-Where should I be?
-You're over there.

28
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,169
{\an8}-And me?
-Here.

29
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:50,737
{\an8}-Then I'm center.
-Yeah.

30
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:52,038
{\an8}Is here okay?

31
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:54,941
{\an8}Which way? Here? Here?

32
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:59,946
<i>The six members get along so well
they give the staff a hard time.</i>

33
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:02,849
This is the reason you're pushing.

34
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:07,554
{\an8}I'm like your kid brother.

35
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:15,161
{\an8}<i>The humorous Jesse,
and the beloved oldest member Yugo Kochi.</i>

36
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:22,101
{\an8}<i>And the laidback Taiga Kyomoto</i>

37
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:25,772
{\an8}<i>as well as Hokuto Matsumura,
the brainy one in the group.</i>

38
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:31,110
{\an8}<i>The youngest, Shintaro Morimoto,
is the life of the party.</i>

39
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:34,781
{\an8}<i>and Juri Tanaka's role is
to bring the group together.</i>

40
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:36,382
{\an8}SHINTARO MORIMOTO (24)
JURI TANAKA (26)

41
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:38,384
{\an8}JANUARY 2020 DEBUT

42
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:42,855
{\an8}<i>The thing they have put
the most work into is their music.</i>

43
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:48,161
{\an8}<i>In just two years since their debut,
they've released 50 songs.</i>

44
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:54,200
It's like a dream.

45
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:58,871
Being able to do so much music
in this environment

46
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:02,508
is an ideal situation.

47
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,444
And it's exceeded it.

48
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:08,381
<i>Their strength is singing.</i>

49
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:13,620
{\an8}<i>This January, they received
a lot of attention for their performance</i>

50
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:16,823
{\an8}<i>on the one shot recording series,</i>
THE FIRST TAKE.

51
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:18,224
{\an8}"IMITATION RAIN" FROM "THE FIRST TAKE"

52
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:03,703
{\an8}<i>Meetings for production of
the second album have begun.</i>

53
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:08,608
{\an8}<i>They ask the members
what they want from the tracks.</i>

54
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:12,078
I liked this song, so I want to do it.

55
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:17,417
It might go faster if we fit them into
morning, noon, or night first.

56
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:25,491
<i>They repeatedly listen to the songs
to pick each one carefully.</i>

57
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:29,162
<i>On this day, they were
discussing a particular song.</i>

58
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:34,334
If we choose a song like "RAM-PAM-PAM"
people might find it lame.

59
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,672
So we need to break away from
something like "RAM-PAM-PAM",

60
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:42,241
and hook them with a melody or chorus.

61
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:44,777
Yeah, something more like a song.

62
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,079
And one more...

63
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:50,717
If we're factoring a concert,
rather than relying on dance for intensity

64
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:54,921
the intensity is individual so
having a more aggressive song is better.

65
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:58,224
I agree with Hokuto, in terms of approach.

66
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,392
A sense of unity?

67
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:03,830
There wasn't anything better than
"RAM-PAM-PAM" or "Special Order" for me.

68
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:04,797
Yeah.

69
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:13,740
{\an8}<i>"RAM-PAM-PAM" is a killer track that
never fails to pump up the crowd.</i>

70
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:19,011
<i>The song symbolizes SixTONES' brand,
which is not your typical idol fare.</i>

71
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,917
<i>How will they evolve
from their existing discography?</i>

72
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:28,020
<i>It's something they are
always thinking about.</i>

73
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:30,423
What's a deciding factor?

74
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,592
If it's a song I want to do or not.

75
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:37,063
{\an8}Since we want to do music properly,
we do the songs we want.

76
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,731
{\an8}Cool songs.

77
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:39,899
{\an8}That's the best.

78
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:41,768
Or else it's not fun.

79
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:48,007
I want to enjoy my work
such that it doesn't feel like work.

80
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,610
{\an8}HOKUTO MATSUMURA (26)

81
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:54,380
{\an8}<i>Their solo careers have also
taken off since their debut.</i>

82
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:59,419
{\an8}<i>Hokuto Matsumura has
a regular spot on an art magazine.</i>

83
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:02,855
{\an8}<i>Recently, he's known
for his excellent acting career.</i>

84
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,292
Not that direction.

85
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,264
{\an8}TV DRAMA <i>COME, COME, EVERYBODY</i>

86
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:17,170
{\an8}<i>In 2021, he gained attention
for his role in an NHK morning drama,</i>

87
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:23,476
{\an8}<i>as Minoru Kijima, a character who had
a big impact on the protagonist's life.</i>

88
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:30,950
{\an8}DRAMA <i>WHO NEEDS TRUE LOVE?</i>

89
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:35,388
{\an8}<i>And from April, he had
a new TV drama in the works.</i>

90
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:42,495
<i>He played a chef-in-training who
captured the hearts of the female patrons.</i>

91
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:46,332
<i>He had many names of dishes
to remember for his lines.</i>

92
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,700
Copy that.

93
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:50,002
-Rolling.
-We're rolling.

94
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:52,371
Ready! Action!

95
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:56,742
Excuse me.

96
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,979
Every lunch comes with
salad, bread, and coffee.

97
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:02,315
Today's fish is flounder from Miyagi.

98
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:07,386
The meat is... a pork roast.

99
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:09,155
I'll come back for your order.

100
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:12,024
Cut! Let's try that again.

101
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:13,259
So close.

102
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,827
You tried.

103
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:16,963
That's rare.

104
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:24,237
It happens all the time.

105
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:26,272
I drew a blank.

106
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:32,745
I stumbled on the flounder
from Miyagi for a split second.

107
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:36,215
And as I was thinking,

108
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:39,485
the meat didn't come to me.
I only had the flounder.

109
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:44,023
Here's what I want.

110
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:48,394
Lightly graze her body,
so you're pretty close to her.

111
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:53,432
<i>How will he manifest
the director's orders?</i>

112
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:55,601
I'll be touching you a little bit.

113
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:56,736
Okay.

114
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:01,274
Roll rehearsal. Action!

115
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:06,812
Sorry to keep you waiting.

116
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,015
-Here's your salad.
-Thank you.

117
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:10,516
Can I take a picture?

118
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,486
-No problem, just one moment.
-Okay.

119
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,390
Here is your chicken ratatouille.

120
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:18,958
Are eggplants okay?

121
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:20,660
-Yes.
-Good.

122
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:23,596
-Sorry for the wait.
-Can I?

123
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:26,799
I'm sorry, we're cooking the meat now.

124
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:29,435
Could you wait a little longer? I'm sorry.

125
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:30,970
We'll make it extra good.

126
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:32,371
Thank you very much.

127
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:33,806
You touched them a lot.

128
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:35,641
You went like this then this.

129
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,310
I did touch them a lot.

130
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:38,344
That was funny.

131
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,514
You were really handsy.

132
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,481
We'll use it.

133
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:44,050
Thank you.

134
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:45,484
I think it was great.

135
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:46,852
Thank you.

136
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,192
Do you have a vision for yourself?

137
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:55,628
A vision?

138
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:58,064
If I had to choose,

139
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:02,268
I want to be...

140
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:08,407
someone who is like a threat.

141
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:12,511
There are a lot of our seniors like that.

142
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:17,416
Ninomiya is definitely
a clear example of this.

143
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:22,321
People his age who play similar roles,

144
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:25,891
they must see him as a threat.

145
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:30,096
Ninomiya has something
that nobody else does.

146
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:35,101
He has this presence in his roles

147
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:38,137
that is really enchanting.

148
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:43,576
<i>Hectic days acting and singing.</i>

149
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:49,115
<i>However, it's something he's wished for.</i>

150
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,791
{\an8}<i>Production for SixTONES'
second album began.</i>

151
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,926
{\an8}Was it over there?

152
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,895
{\an8}You're pretty busy all day, right?

153
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:05,931
{\an8}-Yeah, with this and that.
-This and that.

154
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:06,866
{\an8}Good luck.

155
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:08,434
{\an8}-Thank you.
-Okay.

156
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:17,209
{\an8}"<i>With the Flow" is a duo track for
Taiga Kyomoto and Juri Tanaka.</i>

157
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:21,313
<i>A special song
Tanaka wrote the rap lyrics for.</i>

158
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,987
{\an8}<i>Kyomoto is also a star in musicals.</i>

159
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:31,490
{\an8}<i>In the top Japanese musical</i> Elisabeth<i>,</i>

160
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:35,561
{\an8}<i>he worked with iconic stars
and worked on his expressiveness.</i>

161
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:41,834
{\an8}<i>And in 2021, Shuichiro Koike,
the master behind Elisabeth</i>

162
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:46,072
{\an8}<i>cast Kyomoto as the main role
in his next production.</i>

163
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:56,148
Okay, got it.

164
00:11:56,916 --> 00:12:01,087
<i>He has strong feelings
when it comes to music.</i>

165
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:29,715
I think I messed up the second one.

166
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:31,250
I think I goofed it up.

167
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:35,387
Sorry.

168
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:08,988
For the line that goes "trivial worries,"
I think at the end I'll...

169
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:11,457
bring my voice down to a natural tone.

170
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:15,494
Like that.

171
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,230
Can we record a take like that?

172
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,099
Mixing it my natural voice

173
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,402
might make it easier to follow the rhythm.

174
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,970
Thank you.

175
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,648
Here we go.

176
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:38,184
-Good work today.
-Thank you.

177
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,285
Thank you.

178
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:40,719
Can you give us a sec?

179
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:41,854
No problem.

180
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:44,356
The chorus is coming along.

181
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:46,125
-Yeah?
-It sounded nice.

182
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:47,960
I'm getting the hang of it.

183
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:51,030
I Might be able to
figure out the right melody.

184
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:53,232
I'm still working on it.

185
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,468
It feels like...

186
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:59,071
You're firing us up too.

187
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:00,840
That's really helpful.

188
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:02,875
It's nice to hear.

189
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:07,246
<i>For this track,</i>

190
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:11,517
<i>he will be recording
his guitar playing for the first time.</i>

191
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:22,661
This being our second album,
I want to up my game to the next level.

192
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:24,163
We all do.

193
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:28,200
Like how Juri wrote
some of the rap lyrics himself this time.

194
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:31,637
A lot of us are trying things
for the first time for this.

195
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:37,209
I'm sure the other four are
taking up their own challenges too.

196
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:39,578
Okay.

197
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:08,173
Sounds good. Just one thing.

198
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,109
When you're strumming up.

199
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:11,944
Yeah, put an accent there.

200
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:13,412
Got it.

201
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:16,015
Let's give it a listen.

202
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:19,685
Wow.

203
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,270
Sounds good!

204
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:39,939
Was that me playing?

205
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:41,106
It was.

206
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:43,142
-That was me, right?
-Yeah.

207
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,010
-What?
-Nice job.

208
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:47,079
I've debuted. Man.

209
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,649
I guess you can debut multiple times.

210
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,084
That's amazing.

211
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:56,255
Honestly, I thought I was done for
when I got the sheet music.

212
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:58,123
It looked so hard.

213
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,895
But you said you wanted to play it.

214
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,663
-Yeah.
-That's what I heard.

215
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,598
You know.

216
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:09,601
I was in performance mode.

217
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:12,304
Like right before a show.

218
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:14,239
-You know.
-So honest.

219
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,109
Like, "Are you ready for my guitar?!"

220
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:22,081
I was overconfident enough
to say that without thinking.

221
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:24,683
-When the sheet music came...
-Yeah.

222
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,318
Okay, let's do it.

223
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:28,187
-Let's do it.
-Yeah.

224
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:34,159
<i>Juri Tanaka is the group's rapper.</i>

225
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,663
{\an8}<i>He's performed his own lyrics before.</i>

226
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,299
{\an8}I woke up 40 minutes ago.

227
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:44,103
Really?

228
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,637
Yeah.

229
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:47,339
Ready for your verse?

230
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:48,374
Yeah.

231
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,610
So right now, it ends with

232
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:54,046
<i>T-shirts and jeans, in our style</i>

233
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:55,681
That's the flow right now.

234
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:57,950
-Yeah.
-According to the guide.

235
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,552
The one I first came up with was

236
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,525
<i>T-shirts and jeans, in our style</i>

237
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:08,861
<i>T-shirts and jeans, in our style</i>

238
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:10,429
Which feels better?

239
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:11,964
I mean...

240
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:15,234
You're fine either way?

241
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,170
I'll give it a few tries.

242
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:43,929
That's one version.

243
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:49,268
Well, with that version you went

244
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:51,603
<i>T-shirts and jeans, in our style</i>

245
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,840
Oh, "T-shirts and jeans, in our..."

246
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,341
-We'll do a few.
-Okay.

247
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:27,306
I'll go with this.

248
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:29,274
-Thank you.
-Yeah!

249
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:31,643
Okay, I'm ready.

250
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:32,744
Can I go?

251
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:35,814
Nobody's stopping you.

252
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:37,382
People seem hesitant.

253
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:38,750
Oh, yeah?

254
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:41,987
{\an8}<i>July.</i>

255
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:44,623
{\an8}<i>Tanaka received an exciting job.</i>

256
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,592
{\an8}JULY 2021
FNS SUMMER SONG FESTIVAL

257
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,428
I don't have time to talk today.

258
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:50,329
No free time?

259
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:52,498
I've got better things to do.

260
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,034
Look at this set.

261
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,871
Look at this wonderful set.

262
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:01,640
This isn't the time to be filming.

263
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:03,942
Do you admire them?

264
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:04,977
Yeah.

265
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:06,845
You must be happy.

266
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:10,315
I am, but I'm more nervous.

267
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:12,784
I'm nervous.

268
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:18,524
<i>A collaboration he dreamed about.</i>

269
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,096
{\an8}<i>He's working with one of
Japan's greatest rappers,</i>

270
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,832
{\an8}<i>and a world champion DJ.</i>

271
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:28,967
{\an8}R-SHITEI, DJ MATSUNAGA

272
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:34,773
What you have for the chorus works fine.

273
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:38,744
Even just hitting certain words is fine.

274
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,746
You can sing up until then.

275
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:42,347
Okay.

276
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,856
-Okay, got it.
-Something like that.

277
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:55,861
Checking in with everyone!

278
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:13,912

281
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:23,382
<i>are happening one by one.</i>

282
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:28,754
<i>They are only beginning to grow.</i>

283
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,290
Could we swap numbers?

284
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:34,126
Sure.

285
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,461
I was wondering when you'd ask.

286
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:41,767
That was nerve-racking.

287
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:49,908
{\an8}<i>Next time, they start work
on the concert tour.</i>

288
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:52,110
{\an8}We want people to come.

289
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:54,179
{\an8}That's our real job.

290
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:55,180
{\an8}Something cool.

291
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:56,515
{\an8}Something flashy.

292
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:00,719
{\an8}Let me do that again.

293
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:02,054
{\an8}We get worked.

294
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,423
{\an8}My body feels worked.

295
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:07,092
{\an8}It'd be better if Juri did this himself.

296
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,827
{\an8}A duet didn't make sense to me.

297
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:11,330
{\an8}Better to do the better one.
