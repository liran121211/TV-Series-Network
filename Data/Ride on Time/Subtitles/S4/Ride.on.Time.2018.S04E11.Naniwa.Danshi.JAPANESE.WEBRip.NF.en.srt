{\an8}DEBUT CD SET FOR RELEASE!

3
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:11,344
{\an8}<i>Last summer, it was decided that
Naniwa Danshi would release a debut CD.</i>

4
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:15,315
{\an8}<i>A new chapter of their journey just began.</i>

5
00:00:16,549 --> 00:00:17,951
Yes!

6
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,320
Hooray!

7
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:22,822

<i>The excitement lingers
in the seven members.</i>

10
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,466
We just worked all day!

11
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,068
We took a bath.

12
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:37,103
We had nothing until 11 p.m.

13
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,306
Isn't it busier after announcing a debut?
I don't know.

14
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,342
But we've got this here.

15
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:44,444
-But...
-Good morning!

16
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:46,212
-Morning.
-I took a bath.

17
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:47,280
Same here.

18
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:51,317
Whoa, cool! Awesome!

19
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,420
-There's flowers.
-And plushies.

20
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:55,021
Wow!

21
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:56,156
How are they?

22
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,557
-Awesome.
-Thank you.

23
00:00:57,624 --> 00:01:02,695
<i>Each one of them received
flowers matching his member's color.</i>

24
00:01:02,762 --> 00:01:06,132
When I see these kind of things,
the reality sets in.

25
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:07,801
-That you're debuting.
-Yeah!

26
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:12,439
When I see these things, it does set in.

27
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:19,012
{\an8}<i>However, a different feeling
was setting in at the same time.</i>

28
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:45,772

-Okay.

32
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:03,623
<i>Long before this group was even formed,</i>

33
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:07,093

their dreams of debuting as idols.</i>

34
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:15,635

I've said <i>motsunabe</i> and gizzard up to now

43
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:45,498
and edamame recently, but...

44
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:47,901
Those are all old men's favorites!

Bye-bye!

65
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:51,831
Isn't this crazy? We're working at 3 a.m.

66
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,400
-Crazy!
-We're popular idols!

67
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:56,469
That's crazy. It's after 12 a.m.

68
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:58,171
But I'm not sleepy at all.

69
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,372
-Right?
-What?

70
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,711
<i>Today, everything looked different

<i>Everyone was indulging themselves
in happiness.</i>

72
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:18,858
<i>Meanwhile, along with happiness,
another feeling had surfaced in Nishihata.</i>

73
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:27,634
I've seen everybody go through
their debuts all this time,

74
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,569
so I understand that feeling too.

75
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:35,041
That's why,
I can't exactly say this aloud.

76
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:37,243
About this.

77
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:41,414
<i>What was on Nishihata's mind
at this moment</i>

78
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:47,220
<i>was his friends from Kansai Johnny's Jr.
that worked together toward debuting.</i>

79
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:53,293
<i>Because they were friends who supported
one another when times were tough,</i>

80
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:57,463
<i>he was hesitant to indulge
in happiness by himself.</i>

81
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:05,038
We won't be returning
as a Johnny's Jr. group.

82
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:10,009
That's why in these
three and a half months

83
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:15,515
I'd like to do whatever we can
to repay Kansai Johnny's Jr.

84
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:26,125
I personally wish to do one more concert...

85
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:32,799
as a Kansai Johnny's Jr. group.

86
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:34,000
Yeah...

87
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:35,134
Yeah.

88
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:39,138
And we talked about
how we'll concentrate on future work.

89
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:43,576
Thank you very much.

90
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:45,311
I hope we work together again.

91
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:48,881
<i>As the arena tour
and debut preparations continued...</i>

92
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:50,083
We'll practice it.

93
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:52,919
<i>That desire never came true.</i>

94
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:55,021
Alright, see you.

95
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:00,159
{\an8}<i>And this day too,</i>

96
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:04,430
{\an8}<i>there was a member who spoke of
a surprising thought before his debut.</i>

97

{\an8}AUGUST 21, 2021
83 DAYS UNTIL DEBUT

98

{\an8}AICHI PERFORMANCE

99
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,103
These are the lyrics.

100
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:11,104
Oh. Are the parts...

101
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,572
No. There's two songs.

102
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:16,642
<i>The moment arrived to listen
to their long-awaited debut song's demo.</i>

103
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,010
It's called "Ubu LOVE."

104
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:20,380
"Ubu LOVE"? Nice!

105
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:22,281
Oh, I'm super nervous!

106
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:30,056
I see.

107
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:41,968
<i>Oh my god, oh my god</i>

108
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:44,303
<i>OMG, OMG</i>

109
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,906
"OMG, OMG" means "oh my god, oh my god."

110
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:57,383
Oh, awesome!

111
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:03,689
Thank you.

112
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:04,657
We can't wait.

113
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:08,961
<i>The one who gave a surprising comment
was Fujiwara.</i>

114
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:16,803
Umm, I'm more worried now.

115
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:18,871
Like cloudy.

116
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,440
Hmm.

117
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,510
Of course it's important to move on
to the next step, but...

118
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:29,615
Hmm. Right? It's contradictory.

119
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:34,687
I wanted to debut, so I worked for it,
but I get scared once it's final.

120
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:41,894
That's why, in order to distract myself
from that pressure,

121
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:46,732
I play catch, with a baseball.

122
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:50,369
The more that's expected of you,

123
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:54,307
the more pressure's that on you.

124
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,109
Daigo probably feels the same.

125
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,712
And I'm the oldest,

126
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,382
so there's more weight on me.

127
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:05,051
Hmm.

128
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:10,656
I'm sure there are a ton of things
that might crush us from the pressure.

129
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:18,564
{\an8}<i>While holding onto those feelings,
they took on this recording.</i>

130
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:19,932
{\an8}"UBU LOVE" RECORDING

131
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:29,509
Good, it's getting better.

132
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:30,743
Let's go once more.

133
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:38,718
{\an8}<i>Fujiwara decided to do several retakes of
his vital part leading up to the chorus.</i>

134
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:50,963
One last try?

135
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,098
I'm sorry, can we?

136
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:53,633
-Just once more.
-I'm sorry.

137
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,334
-Dinner's on me.
-Last one!

138
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:05,912
Let's hear it!

139
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:07,513
How was that?

140
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,981
Yeah, good! Let's listen!

141
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,083
I suddenly did this while singing.

142
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,658
A hard-won victory.

143
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,560
Okay, we're finished!

144
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:22,828
-Thank you so much.
-Okay, good work!

145
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:23,963
Yes!

146
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:27,433
Probably before,
I would've said okay sooner.

147
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,603
But something inside me was saying that

148
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:33,306
I gotta do much better.

149
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:37,176
Right now, if I decided my own limit,

150
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,312
the perfect score so to speak,

151
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:43,249
I feel like I wouldn't grow any further.

152
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:47,687
Like I mentioned briefly before,
I'm afraid of debuting.

153
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,522
You know, confidence...

154
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:55,261
How much effort you put into it leads
to your confidence.

155
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:58,397
I did a bit of that today.

156
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:03,869
It really was a luxury
to be able to do so.

157
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:08,107
But I did feel that I needed
to aim much higher.

158
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:16,382
<i>Overcoming fear
and fulfilling expectations.</i>

159
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,651
<i>Going forward, that will continue.</i>

{\an8}It's a Ford Thunderbird.

163
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,162

<i>took place on a large set.</i>

166

All takes toward the camera.

<i>To convey puppy love.</i>

00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:21,013
Kyohei, you're a bit stiff. Be more...

173
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,948
I don't have to sing or anything?

174
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,550
-No, you're good.
-So...

175
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:27,720
Well, if you'll make some expressions,
we'll use it.

176
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:29,822
-But mainly...
-Just during the singing.

177
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:34,860
<i>They must produce results
within the limited time they have.</i>

178
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:40,866
<i>For example, even in situations like this.</i>

179
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:43,602
When did that happen?

180
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:44,770
At the start.

181
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:45,771
Crap!

182
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:50,209
I noticed the sole was flopping around,
and thought, "Ah, it peeled off."

183
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,946
-It's done.
-I'm sorry.

184
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:56,282
-Were you okay?
-I was totally fine.

185
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:01,387
<i>There was one problem
while filming the dance part.</i>

186
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,190
Is it okay that I'm at one?

187
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:05,157
Zero.

188
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,425
Then I'd be here.

189
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:07,827
Huh?

190
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,528
Next to the rail and...

191
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:14,166
<i>Their positions weren't working
due to a problem with the markers.</i>

192
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,035
Can you place a tape marker?

193
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:16,936
To mark zero.

194
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:20,506
The rail... Yeah, because it's off.

195
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,275
Is something sticking out?
From the center?

196
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:27,246
<i>The one who came up with an alternate plan
was the leader, Ohashi.</i>

197
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:30,916
Isn't this the center? This white one?

198
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:32,551
This center tag is off.

199
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:33,452
So the center...

200
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,221
Match the center to the rail.

201
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:38,758
This line, if we just put this
over here more...

202
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:41,427
And this side line...

203
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:44,697
Like, if we just have the center line,
we'll be fine.

204
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:47,133
Oh, okay.

205
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:52,171
So, these kind of things
are going to continue going forward.

206
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:56,642
It's a joyful experience to be able
to interact with different people.

207
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:02,948
To be able to create one work together
with different people.

208
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:04,183
I'm thrilled.

209
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:09,755
It's really nice weather today.

210
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:16,796
<i>Ohashi in particular has a strong
determination to survive in this world.</i>

211
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:24,870
<i>He learned the basics of singing
and dancing as a child,</i>

212
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:28,974
<i>and joined the agency
when the time was right at 11 years old.</i>

213
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:33,746
<i>However, he was never chosen for any units</i>

214
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,549
<i>and was a presence
who never got the spotlight.</i>

215
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,618
-One, two.
-One...

216
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:43,923
<i>In the meantime, he earnestly continued
refining his singing and dancing.</i>

217
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:48,727
-One...
-Six, seven, eight!

218
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:50,462
-One...
-Two.

219
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,299
-From there probably...
-Thanks.

220
00:13:57,636 --> 00:14:00,105
<i>He is respected by the other members.</i>

221
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:10,449
Kyohei.

222
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:26,398
<i>He's still continuing his vocal training
while staying updated on new dance styles.</i>

223
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:36,408
"Just sing and dance
in the Johnny's style."

224
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:38,644
"No need to take dance lessons."

225
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:43,415
"We just have to dance
whenever there's a concert."

226
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:45,684
I really hate that kind of mindset.

227
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:47,853
If that's the case,

228
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:51,824
I want to excel at dance within Johnny's.

229
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:56,262
After we make our debut,
we'll probably get more work, right?

230
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:01,400
If we're a group that never changes,
the audience will definitely...

231
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:04,770
They won't be pleased.

232
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:10,676
Plus, as a group we should challenge
ourselves at everything.

233
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:15,915
Or we won't be able to tell
what's good from bad.

234
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:19,585
Well, debuting isn't the goal,
it's the start.

235
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:21,086
Plus, thinking further...

236
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:23,155
Just making our debut

237
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:26,992
probably won't make
me feel like saying, "Yay!"

238
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,163
So pretty!

239
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:34,900
This completely different look
from daytime, it's kind of nice.

240
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:40,873
Once you debut, what do you think
will happen with Naniwa Danshi?

241
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,042
-I wonder.
-Yeah.

242
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,577
Well, I seriously don't know.

243
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:50,015
I have completely no idea...

244
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:57,690
I think Michieda, Takahashi, and Nagao
are probably more prepared for it.

245
00:15:57,756 --> 00:16:00,492
I suddenly joined out of nowhere.

246
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:05,064
So I feel a bit like, "Oh, this is scary."

247
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:09,802
I wonder how things will turn out.
I can't tell until we actually do it.

248
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:12,738
I really do wonder.

249
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:17,042
Well, I'm sure there will be
ups and downs, of course.

250
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:22,181
We probably can't stay as a group
by just being friendly.

251
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:25,351
All of us having respect for each other

252
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:31,890
and consideration for one another is going
to continue for years from here on.

253
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,929
I hope we can strengthen
this aspect of our group.

254
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:40,165
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

255
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:43,168
Vroom... Ka-vroom!

256
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:45,704
Oh, I might be good at motorcycles.

257
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:48,173
A motorcycle waiting at a light.

258
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,309
Oh, that's good.

259
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:51,276
This is our group.

260
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,312
My bike at a light's good, eh?

261
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:07,226
<i>That lingering feeling Nishihata
felt before their debut.</i>

262
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:13,198
<i>It wasn't until the last day of the tour
that it took shape.</i>

263
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:20,005
{\an8}NIIGATA PERFORMANCE

264
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:25,611
{\an8}<i>It happened on the last day
of the National Arena Tour in Niigata.</i>

265
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:31,717
Good morning!

266
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:39,425
<i>The seven members were trying to decide
what they'd been discussing for a week.</i>

267
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:45,464
The last song we sing
as a Kansai Johnny's Jr. group,

268
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:49,234
we don't know
what we want it to be right now.

269
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:52,137
We have the most memories
with "My Dreams."

270
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:59,278
<i>What song will they end their last concert
as a Johnny's Jr. group with?</i>

271
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:02,147
But shouldn't it be a song
we want to sing?

272
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:03,682
Since it's the end.

273
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,453
The fans have their own ideas, but...

274
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:12,124
Keeping that in mind of course,

275
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:14,993
what do we want to sing last?

276
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:22,234
How many minutes is
the full version of "Kansai Island"?

277
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:27,339
-Including the second verse.
-From "<i>arienkuraini</i>," right?

278
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:28,941
Think of it this way...

279
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:34,179
<i>"Kansai Island" is a song solely
for Kansai Johnny's Jr.</i>

280
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:39,418
<i>It is a song embedded with the memories
of hard work with friends.</i>

281
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:41,420
We'll have everyone come out.

282
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:45,090
Let's do it with everyone,
not just the seven of us.

283
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:46,758
This. Since it's the end.

284
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:48,794
You really mean the full version?

285
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:51,630
Seriously... Then how's this?
How about this too?

286
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:54,633
We can't sing this. We'll cry.

287
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:06,845
<i>They appear for their second encore.</i>

288
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,449
Yeah! Okay!

289
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:12,751
We're gonna blast this!

290
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,854
This is our last song
as a Kansai Johnny's Jr. group.

291
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:17,923
Here we go. Please listen.

I'm a fan of Kansai Johnny's Jr.
I love Kansai Johnny's Jr.

308
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:48,113
We gotta work harder and harder
to pass onto the next Kansai kids,

309
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:52,317
to the people of Kansai, a new baton.
