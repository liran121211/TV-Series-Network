00:00:01,735 --> 00:00:04,037
THE FUTURE OF NANIWA DANSHI

2
00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:07,707
<i>Today, they discussed their future.</i>

3
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:11,011
Once the concert tour ends...

4
00:00:11,077 --> 00:00:13,880
I don't know how we'll be,
but how do you wanna be?

5
00:00:13,947 --> 00:00:16,549
Naniwa Danshi in the future.

6
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:21,121
I would like to create
a Johnny's boom again.

7
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:22,789
Ah...

8
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:27,027
I feel that
I want to be a hero to everyone.

9
00:00:27,093 --> 00:00:29,462
A group to make people smile is nice.

10
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,631
Even after we make our debut,

11
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:34,667
I want to do things
nobody has done before.

12
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:36,436
Do things that surprise people.

13
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:37,670
Yeah.

14
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:39,672
Let's keep them surprised.

15
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:43,643
<i>And so, their true feelings
began to flow out.</i>

16
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,180
That's just it. Same with
Arashi's last live concert...

17
00:01:09,602 --> 00:01:12,705
<i>This is documentary series</i> Ride On Time.

18
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:19,612
{\an8}<i>The group finally made their takeoff.</i>

19
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:21,114
{\an8}NOVEMBER 12, 2021
DEBUT

20
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:27,654
Let's try to line up closely on stage.

21
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,255
Yes, thank you.

22
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:32,859
You're going on. Now, please!

23
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:35,128
Wow, awesome!

24
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:39,165
<i>The sea of media had been waiting for</i>

25
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:43,870
{\an8}<i>the idols born from Kansai, Naniwa Danshi.</i>

26
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:51,344
{\an8}"UBU LOVE"

27
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:08,795
{\an8}<i>The group was formed in October, 2018.</i>

28
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:13,099
<i>Their debut.</i>

29
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:17,904
<i>The seven of them continued to chase
that dream beyond dreams.</i>

30
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,540
THREE YEARS OF WORKING TOWARD THEIR DEBUT

31
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:26,246
How we grasp the chance,
how we win that over,

32
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,083
will be up to us.

33
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,521
But we've been doing this
believing that this day would come.

34
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:36,489
DEBUT CD SET FOR RELEASE!

35
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:45,632
<i>There was even a member who had been
waiting 17 years for this moment.</i>

36
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,002
Yes!

37
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:50,837
Hooray!

38
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:16,129
{\an8}<i>This is the path to their debut,
the time until they get on their feet.</i>

39
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,571
{\an8}<i>March of last year,
the group was notified of some news.</i>

40
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:26,272
{\an8}MARCH 2021

41
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:28,541
Hi!

42
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:31,344
We're Naniwa Danshi!

43
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:32,412
Let's go!

44
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:35,448
Unbelievably, our nationwide tour
has been decided!

45
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:37,550
-Let's go!
-Thank you so much!

46
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:38,851
Thank you so much!

47
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:44,190
We'll visit Hokkaido up north
all the way to Fukuoka down south.

48
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:47,527
<i>When they hadn't even heard
of any news on debuting yet,</i>

49
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:50,129
<i>their nationwide arena tour was decided.</i>

50
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:54,500
<i>Behind the scenes, one of their senior's
presence was always there.</i>

51
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:01,874
<i>He has been watching over them
since the group was formed.</i>

52
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:05,979
{\an8}<i>Tadayoshi Ohkura of KanJani8.</i>

53
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:12,852
<i>He knew that this was an important time</i>

54
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,888
<i>for Naniwa Danshi
who was working toward their debut.</i>

55
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:17,290
Oh, it's okay.

56
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:20,093
To be honest,

57
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:24,497
I already knew their debut was underway
when they decided on the concert.

58
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:31,838
I want them to be a Johnny's group
that will represent their generation.

59
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:35,942
It's not like they'll have
a producer forever.

60
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:40,647
So I wanted to give them a big test

61
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:43,383
and see how they do with it.

62
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,818
To shape up their qualities more

63
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:50,390
and to train them internally.

64
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,558
That was probably the test.

65
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:54,093
Yeah.

66
00:04:56,496 --> 00:05:01,067
<i>The stage direction was assigned for
the first time to the group's center role,</i>

67
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:03,670
{\an8}<i>Daigo Nishihata.</i>

68
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:05,605
{\an8}NANIWA DANSHI
DAIGO NISHIHATA (24)

69
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:11,044
{\an8}From that segment, the flow from the intro
will all be Naniwa's songs.

70
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:11,944
{\an8}Okay.

71
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:15,081
And "Yobaiboshi"
will be the dance version this time.

72
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,115
Okay.

73
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:18,518
The dance just goes with it,
but the sound...

74
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:20,086
The sound doesn't change.

75
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:24,490
I'm super worried about this... layout.

76
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:28,861
If this layout with this set list was okay
is tormenting me now.

77
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:31,497
I'm like, "What do I do?"

78
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:38,638
<i>Nishihata used to belong to
a different unit with Ren Nagase,</i>

79
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:42,508
<i>who is currently in King & Prince,
but that slowly came to an end.</i>

80
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:43,443
DAIGO NISHIHATA

81
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:50,149
<i>He was betting everything
on Naniwa Danshi as his last chance.</i>

82
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:54,187
{\an8}<i>And there was another member</i>

83
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:57,857
{\an8}<i>who held the same feelings
in his heart as Nishihata.</i>

84
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:02,395
{\an8}<i>Ryusei Onishi, who was working
to become an idol since he was ten.</i>

85
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,265
{\an8}RYUSEI ONISHI (20)

86
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:11,037
{\an8}<i>For this tour, he is in charge
of the concert merchandise.</i>

87
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:13,740
{\an8}No, I just happened to be here.

88
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:15,475
This is a face mask charm.

89
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,276
Not many people wear charms,

90
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:21,547
so we can have everyone use them
for concerts or special occasions.

91
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:23,383
And days when they're not used,

92
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:27,620
I thought it might be cute
to put them on these small plushies.

93
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:29,555
So I'm testing them now.

94
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:31,557
I don't want to mess up.

95
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:34,894
Which one's cute?

96
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:40,900
{\an8}<i>The one who has performed
in many films and dramas,</i>

97
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:42,702
{\an8}<i>Shunsuke Michieda.</i>

98
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:46,139
{\an8}NANIWA DANSHI
SHUNSUKE MICHIEDA (19)

99
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:48,708
Mr. Michieda,
that was so good to the point

100
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:52,211
where a snake and a mongoose
could probably become friends.

101
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:57,350
Your analogy. Your analogy is...

102
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:03,322
<i>Despite his dreamy looks,
he has a very earnest character.</i>

103
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:15,935
<i>He always arrives first at the studio
for rehearsals, sweating away.</i>

104
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:21,374
Thank you very much!

105
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:30,683
{\an8}<i>The one who supports the group
with his singing is Kyohei Takahashi.</i>

106
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,553
{\an8}NANIWA DANSHI
KYOHEI TAKAHASHI (21)

107
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:34,887
Let's stretch the end.

108
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:39,892
-Right, right. Let's go!
-Yes.

109
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:49,502
Right, right! That pitch!

110
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:51,637
After that pitch, continue naturally.

111
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:55,174
Was your voice that strong before?
Hasn't it become louder?

112
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:58,010
My volume?
Well, I do voice training after all.

113
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:02,048
Yes, so I was better
at those lower keys before,

114
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:04,350
but higher keys are easier now.

115
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:05,585
Really.

116
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:09,789
<i>The costumes essential
to excite the concerts.</i>

117
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:16,729
{\an8}<i>The one who was racking his brain
over those designs was Kento Nagao.</i>

118
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:20,032
{\an8}NANIWA DANSHI
KENTO NAGAO (19)

119
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:24,670
I thought we could wear a baseball shirt
with a baseball jacket over it.

120
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:26,239
When I told this to Jo.

121
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:28,641
He said,
"Anyone over No. 100 is a trainee."

122
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:32,879
"We're working towards our debut,
so we're the same,"

123
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:35,081
he says with his back toward me.

124
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:36,082
-How funny.
-Right?

125
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,820
<i>He has an innocent and lovable character.</i>

126
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:48,427
{\an8}<i>A big fan of baseball
and always wearing a baseball uniform</i>

127
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:51,364
{\an8}<i>is the oldest member, Joichiro Fujiwara.</i>

128
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:52,899
{\an8}JOICHIRO FUJIWARA (25)

129
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:59,038
<i>He joined the agency at eight years old,
but his peers outpassed him repeatedly.</i>

130
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:02,642
<i>He worked on making his debut
without giving up for 17 years.</i>

131
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:06,445
If we do this at Miyagi
and at Yokohama Arena again...

132
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:09,749
<i>During that time,
he has been polishing his comedy skills.</i>

133
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,986
<i>He writes the script
of the concert host's part too.</i>

134
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:15,321
Do scissors...

135
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,923
Rock-paper-scissors!

136
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:19,025
If you win, bang. If you lose, no.

137
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:21,260
-Rock-paper-scissors!
-Bang!

138
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:22,795
Rock-paper-scissors!

139
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:23,696
<i>Chuki</i>.

140
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:25,631
-Wait, wait...
-What is that?

141
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:32,872
{\an8}<i>And the leader who loves to eat,
Kazuya Ohashi.</i>

142
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:34,507
{\an8}Yum!

143
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,542
{\an8}Yum!

144
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:38,077
{\an8}Yum-yum!

145
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:39,412
{\an8}Thank you!

146
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:47,820
<i>He looks like a clown at first glance,</i>

147
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:53,659
<i>but in fact, he is the pillar that upholds
the Naniwa Danshi's music and dances.</i>

148
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:04,070
That was great. Here we go. Um...

149
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:08,307
<i>The firm determination
to survive in this world</i>

150
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:11,077
<i>has always encouraged the members.</i>

151
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:15,081
Feels like I haven't been here in a while.

152
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:20,186
You can't try to have
a taste of normal life.

153
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:21,821
Not in this occupation.

154
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:24,790
So, I want to be a person who thinks,

155
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:29,028
"I hope everyone works hard,"
or "Let's work hard today."

156
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:31,397
It's not tough at all.

157
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:34,467
{\an8}JUNE 27, 2021

158
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,869
{\an8}<i>The final rehearsal of the tour.</i>

159
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:44,043
<i>It is the day that determines
if their efforts pay off</i>

160
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:47,246
<i>for what they've built up
from March up to this day.</i>

161
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,715
Eh, this is that thing!

162
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:53,619
Oh, that's awesome! So cool!

163
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:55,554
-Wow!
-I want this!

164
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:56,956
I want this! Just this!

165
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:59,325
-Everyone will get one.
-"Naniwa Danshi."

166
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:00,393
Uh, how's it look?

167
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:01,293
Oh, I'm sorry.

168
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,497
We win.

169
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:06,966
The sound of the drumsticks
will enter a bit...

170
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:10,269
<i>The concert's main staff
have all gathered.</i>

171
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:14,240
The timings of the actions
will be told through the mic.

172
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:15,875
Let's give it our best.

173
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:17,476
Let's give it our best!

174
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:41,133
All members exit the stage.

175
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:48,574
<i>For this tour, including the encores,
they will sing over thirty songs.</i>

176
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:55,181
<i>The key to doing this is dressing quickly.</i>

177
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:58,050
<i>Ten sets of costumes were prepared.</i>

178
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:36,922
This is where it comes out.

179
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:46,365
Okay, good work!

180
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,833
Good work everyone!

181
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:55,541
Timing-wise, it's perfectly two hours.

182
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,879
<i>The problem seems to be the dressing time.</i>

183
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:05,985
<i>They will have to layer two costumes.</i>

184
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:10,589
<i>Their limit to dress here is two minutes.</i>

185
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:15,327
You did it, a minute and fifty seconds.

186
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:16,796
No, I didn't.

187
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:19,665
Two minutes, two minutes passed.

188
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:20,866
I messed up the order.

189
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:23,068
Yeah, the shoes first was better.

190
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,170
-Right.
-Yeah.

191
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:26,238
And I spread the <i>hakama</i> too much.

192
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:31,644
We need to start thinking
that we may not make it in time.

193
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:34,780
Since we probably won't have time
to practice on site.

194
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:39,285
Most of these costumes weren't seen live,
so I want to show these new costumes...

195
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:40,853
As much as possible.

196
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,422
I do want to show them
as much as possible.

197
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:48,861
But there's no point if we can't make it.
That would be the worst-case scenario...

198
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:50,162
True.

199
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:56,735
<i>What's important is trial and error while
compromising between ideals and reality.</i>

200
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:58,771
We won't have time if we return here...

201
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,072
-At all?
-Not at all!

202
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:03,209
Near here, there's a stairway
to go under stage...

203
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:08,714
<i>In the end, it was solved by shifting
the dressing area closer to the stage.</i>

204
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:11,317
Except, these types of routes are showing.

205
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:12,218
And here...

206
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:15,855
<i>It's the result of all seven's discussion.</i>

207
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:20,459
Just when we were formed,

208
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,731
I don't think we were able
to freely speak our minds.

209
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:30,836
We blindly listened to the grown-ups
or to whatever the elders told us maybe.

210
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:35,774
But lately, even the younger members
give lots of feedback too.

211
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:40,045
It's very you know...
I can sense that they're talking honestly.

212
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,249
But I'm worried about that there.

213
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:46,185
Like how we're going to turn out.

214
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:47,152
Yeah.

215
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,988
What kind of...

216
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:55,995
group Naniwa Danshi wants to be.

217
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:04,536
<i>They began to speak their minds.</i>

218
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:09,942
I don't know how we'll be,
but how do you wanna be?

219
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:12,378
What kind of figure do you want to be?

220
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:16,315
What kind... of idol do you want to be?

221
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:17,850
It could be personally too.

222
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:24,156
If there's a personal future image
of Naniwa Danshi, I'd like to hear it.

223
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:30,362
<i>The future of Naniwa Danshi.</i>

224
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:35,968
<i>Nishihata was the one to begin speaking
about his admirable seniors.</i>

225
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:40,806
I grew up watching Arashi, so...

226
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:48,647
The image Arashi painted in my head
was really intense.

227
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:50,649
-Yeah.
-Like the image I had of them.

228
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:53,852
So that's why I want us
to become like that.

229
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:56,855
To become someone's help
and someone's support.

230
00:15:56,922 --> 00:16:00,192
To become a figure
that could cheer people up like that.

231
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:01,560
So...

232
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,295
By Naniwa Danshi existing,

233
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:06,498
if more people could feel that way,
that would be nice.

234
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:09,034
A dome concert doesn't equal
a national idol.

235
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:10,235
-That's true.
-Right?

236
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,905
Not just because we reached a milestone...

237
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:13,806
Well...

238
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,609
In the entire Japanese audience,
I want us to be...

239
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:20,212
To be acknowledged as an idol group.

240
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,447
That's difficult.

241
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:24,450
-So our seniors are incredible.
-I don't understand!

242
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:26,952
What's the standard of a national idol?

243
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:28,921
I don't know what the standard is...

244
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,190
A group to make people smile is nice.

245
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:34,860
When Arashi goes to the country,
even grandmas would say,

246
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:37,930
"Oh, you're Arashi, aren't you?"
and comes up to them.

247
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,566
Like, they're smiling
just from meeting them.

248
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:43,268
A figure that everybody
recognizes in person,

249
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:47,439
who can make everyone smile,
is probably what a national idol is.

250
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:52,211
In my opinion, being able
to give everyone hope for tomorrow

251
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:54,947
or give energy to survive,
to motivate people,

252
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,716
to make people positive, are also factors.

253
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:00,652
To make people feel happy too.

254
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:03,555
If we can make each
and every person happy,

255
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:07,126
that's what a national idol
would be in my opinion.

256
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:09,762
Plus, in Naniwa Danshi's future,

257
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:14,033
I feel that
I want to be a hero to everyone.

258
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,535
So, although the place may be different,

259
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:19,104
or even if the occupation
may be different,

260
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:21,507
we want to become the hero of idols.

261
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:22,808
Mm.

262
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,276
In the future.

263
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:28,113
I would like to create
a Johnny's boom again.

264
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,782
Ah...

265
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:34,486
Currently, there's all kinds of idols
besides Johnny's,

266
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,488
so I wanna prove Johnny's great.

267
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:40,793
Because Johnny's is like
the pioneer of boy idol groups.

268
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:42,327
Johnny's is...

269
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:45,330
So we wanna become a group
that will live up to that.

270
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,799
Right.

271
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:48,100
And you, Takahashi?

272
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:50,302
I just wanna make people happy.

273
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,205
Well, that's vague, but important.

274
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:54,440
That's most important!

275
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:56,942
I want to be part of people's lives.

276
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:58,110
Oh!

277
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:00,946
Having people just see
our good side is you know...

278
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:04,116
Well, I understand. I get it.

279
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:05,284
That's what I value.

280
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:08,020
You grow thanks to
these people who scold you.

281
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,721
They help you notice things.

282
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:12,424
Some say, "Naniwa Danshi again?"

283
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:16,695
These words may hurt a bit, but...

284
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:17,863
That just depends.

285
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,632
If you think
that's how much they watch us...

286
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,001
That's a compliment.

287
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:25,404
You know, since our Johnny's Jr. days,

288
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:28,006
we've been doing a lot
of unexplored things.

289
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:31,210
The Koshien tournament
and commercials too.

290
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,445
Even after we make our debut,

291
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:35,214
I want to do things
nobody has done before.

292
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,115
From here on too.

293
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:37,983
Do things that surprise people.

294
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,351
Yeah.

295
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:43,655
Arashi and SMAP probably
went through a stormy path.

296
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:48,727
We shouldn't just trace that path,
we need to make a Naniwa Danshi path.

297
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,497
And like, live every moment
of our own lives.

298
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:53,132
Well, this...

299
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:56,301
Not knowing the future yet

300
00:18:56,368 --> 00:19:00,005
means that we really don't know
our potential, right?

301
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:03,842
So if we can enhance
our potential further...

302
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:06,512
I think everything ends
once we realize our possibilities.

303
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:11,550
I want to continue being in a state
of not knowing our potential.

304
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:14,153
It's scary, but it's more fun that way.

305
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:16,555
I don't know how we'll be...

306
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:25,130
But I really want Naniwa Danshi
to become an idol

307
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:29,835
that could represent Japan.

308
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:33,805
We've never had any time
for these kinds of chats before.

309
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:37,309
When these talks begin,
everything's nearly done cleaning up.

310
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:40,546
If we can have these kinds of discussions

311
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:46,451
going forward too,
without being embarrassed.

312
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,321
Well, we'll be more embarrassed as we age.

313
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:51,623
But I hope we can stay like that.

314
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,861
Like, this suddenly came to me,
but I want to take a group photo now.

315
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:57,729
Seriously?

316
00:19:57,796 --> 00:19:59,598
-I don't know!
-Like this? Now?

317
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:03,335
Yeah! We could look back on
how we did this with the seven of us.

318
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:05,504
I want to take a photo of this.

319
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:08,440
I want to make this one photo precious.

320
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:10,742
-Then let's take it.
-Yeah.

321
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:12,544
Me too, I'm a little...

322
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:14,479
Oh no, I think I'm tearing up!

323
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:19,151
Wait a minute,
my eyes are seriously watery right now!

324
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,854
Of course we'll have footage,
but I want to save a photo.

325
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:27,759
A photo after rehearsal feels like,
"Oh..." but I don't know.

326
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:29,828
We've never taken one before!

327
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:30,729
I don't know.

328
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:32,130
Here it goes.

329
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:39,605
<i>The summer of 2021,
they discussed their future.</i>

330
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:43,775
{\an8}JULY 3, 2021
MIYAGI

331
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:46,278
{\an8}<i>The group's arena tour began.</i>

332
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:48,914
Let's go!

333
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:50,882
-Wow.
-Let's go!

334
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:52,217
-Wow.
-Good morning!

335
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:53,118
Good morning!

336
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:54,519
Awesome!

337
00:20:56,822 --> 00:21:00,292
<i>The stadium was their biggest ever.</i>

338
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:02,761
How cool!

339
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:03,729
Wow!

340
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:04,663
This is awesome.
