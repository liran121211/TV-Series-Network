2021 SPRING
7 COLORS OF LIGHT EMITTED BY A GROUP OF 7

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,244
I don't know how many tours we have left,
but let's go out there and have fun!

3
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:12,412
Can we do that?!

4
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:13,580
We can do it!

5
00:00:13,646 --> 00:00:14,547
Okay, let's go.

6
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:16,449
Yeah!

7
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:17,684
Yay!

8
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,388
{\an8}<i>It's been seven years since their debut.</i>

9
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:22,989
{\an8}<i>JOHNNY'S WEST.</i>

10
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,097
{\an8}<i>This year's tour will be the first to
feature a live audience in two years.</i>

11
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:32,399
{\an8}<i>However...</i>

12
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:37,604
{\an8}As of right now, Osaka's been canceled.

TOMOHIRO KAMIYAMA (28)

14
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:43,109
{\an8}<i>Due to the spread of
the novel coronavirus,</i>

15
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:47,580
{\an8}<i>the concert that was planned to be held
in their hometown, Osaka, was canceled.</i>

16
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:55,121
{\an8}<i>And the rock festival they were hoping
to perform in, has also been canceled.</i>

17
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:59,926
{\an8}<i>The group steadily loses
venues to perform.</i>

18
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:02,028
{\an8}<i>The group of seven
on their seventh anniversary.</i>

19
00:01:08,768 --> 00:01:12,372
{\an8}<i>What will they be able to do
in this tough situation?</i>

20
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,442
{\an8}Definitely this year.

21
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:19,612
It's <i>RIDE ON TIME</i>!

22
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:25,752

23
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:27,153

Yokohama, you're the last show!

27
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,355
Let's hit it out of the ballpark!

28
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:03,723
Let's go! Yeah!

29
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:19,038
{\an8}<i>In April 2014,
JOHNNY'S WEST made their debut.</i>

30
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:32,285

{\an8}<i>The oldest, Junta Nakama, shows

00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:56,576
{\an8}<i>Everyone can rely on him.</i>

{\an8}Can you keep up with us?

58
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:41,020
Today's the first zodiac reunion
in 100 years.

59
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:42,355
I can't watch this!

60
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:45,592
<i>They've been searching for their own path.</i>

61
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:46,793
No, I can't hold this.

62
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:48,861
Hey, you're holding it in your hand!

63
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:54,033
{\an8}The first five years after we debuted...

64
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,135
{\an8}It felt like we were calm at sea.

65
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:58,204
{\an8}No tailwinds or headwinds.

66
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:02,408
{\an8}The public didn't really know
about JOHNNY'S WEST.

67
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:03,943
{\an8}TOKYO AND KYOCERA DOME TOURS 2020

68
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:08,314
{\an8}<i>But they finally got their chance
to hold two large dome tours last year.</i>

69
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:13,786
{\an8}<i>But with the pandemic,
that dream did not come true.</i>

70
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:19,392
{\an8}We haven't really gone ahead of ourselves.

71
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:22,061
{\an8}We've taken it one step at a time.

72
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:25,231
{\an8}In fact, we've had times
where we stopped progressing.

73
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:26,833
{\an8}That's why...

74
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,736
We want to perform at the Dome.

75
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:35,074
<i>The winds started blowing
in their favor this year.</i>

76
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:41,681
{\an8}<i>Both Shigeoka and Hamada are starring
as main characters in their own dramas.</i>

77
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:46,252
{\an8}<i>And this fall, the group's namesake
program will air on national television.</i>

78
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,688
{\an8}NAMESAKE PROGRAM
TO AIR ON NATIONAL TELEVISION

79
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:52,058
{\an8}So viewers, now's the time
to invest in us.

80
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:58,264
{\an8}They'll be like, "We should have
cheered for JOHNNY'S WEST more back then."

81
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,736
<i>Everything started in February.</i>

82
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:10,443
{\an8}<i>Starting in April, the group will have
a seven-stop tour around the country</i>

83
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,511
{\an8}<i>called</i> rainboW.

{\an8}CONCERT MEETING

85
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:18,418
{\an8}<i>The meeting to finalize the first concert
with a live audience in two years.</i>

86
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:24,857
{\an8}"Big Dipper" hasn't changed.
Let's go with the full.

87
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:27,527
{\an8}And this is from the headset.

88
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:29,662
-Headset.
-Headset?

89
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:33,766
With a mic, I thought that
it might look like a different dance.

90
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:38,171
<i>It's been three years
since Fujii started directing.</i>

91
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:40,406
<i>There have been some big changes.</i>

92
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,710
{\an8}<i>Kotaki, the youngest says...</i>

93
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:45,144
{\an8}NOZOMU KOTAKI (25)

94
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:48,548
We had less meetings before.

95
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:50,550
We only went over the important parts

96
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:53,286
and found that
we often weren't ready in time.

97
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,355
With Ryusei at the center,

98
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:59,625
We're not sure what to do
about the live performances over the year.

99
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,961
Fujii's been thinking
about it all this time.

100
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,197
{\an8}Good morning.

101
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:05,832
{\an8}MARCH
CONCERT FOOTAGE FILMING

102
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:09,635
{\an8}<i>Today they're filming footage
to open their concerts.</i>

103
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,105
You can see my face at the last moment.

104
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:14,707
It's like, bam...

105
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:18,578
<i>Fujii pays great attention
to detail here as well.</i>

106
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:21,647
Ready, action!

107
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:27,053
JOHNNY'S WEST's live performances
are generally like "Bam! Ryusei Fujii!"

108
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,554
Then it's like, "Wow!"

109
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:32,792
{\an8}The way I see it is
all about the timing of the "Wow."

110
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,661
But this time we can't say anything.

111
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:39,932
So I'd like the footage
to be a bit more natural.

112
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:43,069
We won't put anything like "Bam!"
or any names this time.

113
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:44,036
Okay, cut.

114
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:45,204
Cut.

115
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:46,105
Cut!

116
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:48,441
Okay, thank you!

117
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:49,642
Okay!

118
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:51,177
Thank you!

119
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:54,414
<i>They're doing what they can
during the pandemic.</i>

120
00:06:58,117 --> 00:07:01,287
{\an8}<i>Fujii joined Johnny&Associates,Inc.
in 2006.</i>

121
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:03,589
{\an8}<i>He was 13 years old at the time.</i>

122
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:06,159
{\an8}<i>He was a tough boy that played soccer.</i>

123
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,330
<i>It was his mother
who suggested Johnny&Associates, Inc.</i>

124
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:17,670
<i>But he turned 18 before he could debut.</i>

125
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:22,475
I was just constantly in a daze.

126
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:24,710
I thought it'd be better if I quit.

127
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,479
But there were two choices.

128
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,317
Quit or join the Nissay Theatre.

129
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:36,556
{\an8}I called Mr. Johnny and said I want to
join Nissay Theatre's <i>Shonentachi</i>.

130
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,892
{\an8}And he said, "But I officially
announced the members already."

131
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,461
{\an8}"You can't join now."

132
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:45,198
I thought about giving up,
but two days later...

133
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:46,732
"Nissay Rehearsal."

134
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,770
The sign said, "People going to Nissay."

135
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:55,041
And I saw my name and Nozomu's.

136
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,743
I was like, "Whoa!"

137
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:01,147
I thought to myself, "I'm going!"

138
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:04,083
This sort of helped
continue my life at Johnny's.

139
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,885
I laid this town to waste.

140
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:09,789
They called me Johnny at the time.

141
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:10,690
18 YEARS OLD

142
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:16,195
It's better to do something and regret it,
than regret not doing something.

143
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:22,401
{\an8}<i>Kamiyama, who spent his junior days
with Fujii says...</i>

144
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:24,303
{\an8}RYUSEI FUJII
TOMOHIRO KAMIYAMA

145
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:29,942
These days, Ryusei's been studying
how to direct concerts a lot lately.

146
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:33,579
He goes to see other artists perform.

147
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:36,983
He even went to Las Vegas to study.

148
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:40,119
He's proactive and always on the move.

149
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:43,823
He's taking it all in
and using it to help the group.

150
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:44,891
TOMOHIRO KAMIYAMA (28)

151
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:47,159
So I really trust him with this stuff.

152
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:48,728
I need a "zun!" here.

153
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,231
Can we do it again?

154
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:54,333
-Can we do it again?
-One more time?

155
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:03,876
<i>With Fujii at the center, the group
will try something new in their concerts.</i>

156
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:09,315
This time, all seven members
will have their own solos.

157
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,551
This is the first time
we'll be doing this.

158
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:15,655
It's an average of five minutes
for each member.

159
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,657
That's a total of 35 minutes.

160
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:18,591
Right.

161
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:21,561
Thirty-five minutes of solos
in a two hour concert?

162
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:23,462
I think that's pretty amazing.

163
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:26,532
And this will be a challenge for us.

164
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:30,903
But if every member can really shine
for their five minutes,

165
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:34,206
it'll be an amazing feat
as a seven-member group.

166
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:37,276
Our seventh anniversary
with seven individual solos.

167
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:43,316
<i>There's a member in the group</i>

168
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:46,252
<i>that pays great attention
to their solo performance.</i>

169
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:47,286
MARCH

170
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:48,654
Good morning.

171
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,357
Good morning, morning!

172
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:56,462
I've brought the equipment I usually use
and the guitar I'll need today.

173
00:09:57,863 --> 00:10:00,333
<i>Kamiyama who works
on the composition and lyrics</i>

174
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,969
<i>is filled with passion for the music.</i>

175
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:08,407
{\an8}KAMIYAMA IS SERIALIZED
IN MUSIC MAGAZINE, MG.

176
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:12,578
{\an8}<i>On this day, a scoop for a music magazine
where his works have been serialized.</i>

177
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:13,946
{\an8}Good morning.

178
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:15,314
{\an8}Good morning. Let's get started.

179
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:16,916
{\an8}-Let's get started.
-Thank you.

180
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:20,620
{\an8}<i>It's a session with the band he admires
that has arranged his solo song.</i>

181
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:22,822
{\an8}I'm really nervous!

182
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:25,925
{\an8}No, no. We're the ones nervous here.

183
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:27,526
That's some insane equipment.

184
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:28,494
Yeah, it's amazing.

185
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:29,929
It's hardcore.

186
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:31,497
Isn't that crazy?

187
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:34,700
<i>Kamiyama started the guitar
when he was in middle school.</i>

188
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:37,970
<i>These are all Kamiyama's own equipment.</i>

189
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:42,642
I often play with these at home.

190
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:50,683
{\an8}<i>The reason why he's focused on
the guitar now is because of this song.</i>

191
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,492
<i>He's always wanted
to create a song like this.</i>

192
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:04,196
<i>As for Hamada...</i>

193
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:06,032
JOHNNY'S WEST
TAKAHIRO HAMADA (32)

194
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:09,235
I was actually better at the guitar
than Kamiyama at first.

195
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:11,003
I started learning before him.

196
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:14,106
But he started learning
and before I realized it,

197
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,908
he was teaching me how to play.

198
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:17,009
Seriously.

199
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:18,878
Seeing him get better made me realize

200
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:23,049
just how important it is to keep doing
your best even when no one is watching.

201
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:35,961
<i>Kamiyama's thinking of doing
a creative solo arrangement this time.</i>

202
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:42,068
{\an8}MARCH 13TH
SOLO PRACTICE

203
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:47,173
I want to film all instruments.

204
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:50,776
The guitar, bass, and drums.

205
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:54,880
I want to create a video where
it looks like I'm a five-man band.

206
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:57,016
That's why I'm practicing.

207
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:02,021
If I do something simple,
it won't be interesting.

208
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,292
I want to show the audience what I can do.

209
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:12,364
<i>He's playing all the instruments himself.</i>

210
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:17,903
<i>What kind of solo will he show us?</i>

211
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:25,911
{\an8}<i>Kamiyama joined the agency in 2004.</i>

212
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:30,015
{\an8}<i>He admired V6,
being only 10 years old at the time.</i>

213
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:36,288
<i>His personality took a 180-degree turn
from when he was younger.</i>

214
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:39,325
<i>According to Kotaki...</i>

215
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:42,862
He's calmed down a lot.

216
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:48,100
He used to be so edgy
like a <i>kadokeshi</i> eraser.

217
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,236
He'd say, "Hey, Umeda group!"

218
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:53,339
When we went home,
we had the Umeda and Nanba groups.

219
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:56,142
Like, "Umeda group! Let's go already!"

220
00:12:56,208 --> 00:13:00,179
I tried to stay away back then
because I don't like scary people.

221
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,550
Yeah, I was really uptight back then.

222
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:06,819
It was because I was young.

223
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:12,224
When I first debuted, I still had
a little bit of that personality.

224
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:16,929
I thought, "I gotta do something
about this. I'm his senior."

225
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:19,565
Finding people I can depend on and trust.

226
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,334
Learning how to depend on
and trust someone.

227
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:26,405
That's how I calmed down.

228
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:29,675
Rather than doing everything myself,

229
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:34,346
I would leave some parts for the others.

230
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:37,883
Then I take charge of my own part.

231
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:45,825
<i>Everything starts in Sapporo.</i>

232
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:48,427
<i>The tour of this
seven-member group started here.</i>

233
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:55,701
-Ah!
-Good morning.

234
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,036
Good morning.

235
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:01,140
Good morning.

236
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:02,474
{\an8}APRIL 28

237
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,376
{\an8}<i>This is the third stop in the tour.</i>

238
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:06,445
{\an8}<i>Backstage in Nagoya...</i>

239
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,080
{\an8}JOHNNY'S WEST

240
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:09,682
Hey! Shigeoka!

241
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:11,116
It's <i>RIDE ON TIME</i>!

242
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:14,386
Hey!

243
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:17,056
FILMING: TAKAHIRO HAMADA

244
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:18,524
Ow.

245
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:24,029
You're just here to bother me.
Go over there.

246
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:26,799
This is how Kiriyama dries his hair.

247
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,601
Doing it like this...

248
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:30,169
gets me some nice curls!

249
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:32,972
They're beautiful curls!

250
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:36,775
Sexy, sexy, whoa! Sexy, Ryusei, sexy.

251
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:38,677
We don't really show
the behind-the-scenes.

252
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:39,612
Ah, yeah.

253
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:40,913
"Ah, yeah."

254
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:41,847
Lady bug make up.

255
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:44,049
Yeah, it's spring.

256
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:45,718
-Spring.
-Because it's spring.

257
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:46,986
-Spring style.
-Yep.

258
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,721
Pat, pat, pat, pat.

259
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:50,890
Kamiyama's putting on make up in the air.

260
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:52,992
Look at that powder fall down.

261
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,660
It's <i>RIDE ON TIME</i>!

262
00:14:54,727 --> 00:15:00,799
<i>A blue horizon</i>

263
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:04,803
<i>Run through...</i>

264
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:05,871
<i>Ah...</i>

265
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:07,773
<i>What will this concert be like?</i>

266
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,910
<i>Horizon...</i>

267
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:12,611
Whoa.

268
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:16,115
There's so many people. Let's do this.

269
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:17,750
Thank you, let's go.

270
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:21,520
Are you excited about our show tonight?

271
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:22,588
Piece of cake.

272
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:26,759
Are they really there?

273
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,595
There's a live audience, right?

274
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,231
Wow, it's so quiet.

275
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:34,967
It really is. Are they not there?

276
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:36,869
No audience today?

277
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:42,541
<i>Unlike before, live audiences in concerts...</i>

278
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:50,082
<i>are not allowed to cheer,
shout or make any noise.</i>

279
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:55,154
We got a live audience today too.

280
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,923
Every single time is important for us.

281
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:03,228
Let's have some fun, get everyone excited,
and make it good!

282
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,563
Yay!

283
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:08,634
I don't know how many tours we have left,
but let's go out there and have fun!

284
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:09,735
Can we do that?!

285
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:10,936
We can do it!

286
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:11,837
Okay, let's go.

287
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:13,739
Yeah!

288
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,808
Yay!

289
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:19,745
<i>They're finally going to be
in front of their fans.</i>

290
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:52,845
<i>For the opening song,
they purposely chose a quiet one.</i>

291
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:06,759
It's a narrow hallway,
so please be careful.

292
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:09,695
It's a narrow, so please be careful.

293
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:14,466
We can only do this because of
how well-mannered the audience is.

294
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:19,972
I can feel
the audience's blessings for us.

295
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:24,343
{\an8}<i>Then they had their solos.</i>

There's a lot going on right now.

If you're ever feeling down,
just remember this.

310
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:11,383
You're also part of JOHNNY'S WEST.
Everything will be all right!

00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:15,654
{\an8}<i>The members' emotions got through

{\an8}LET'S CHASE THE DREAM!

00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:19,491
Good work everyone.

315
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:21,126
Yay!

316
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:22,261
Hey there.

317
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,695
We did it!

318
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:31,270
<i>But here in Nagoya,
they were told some bad news.</i>

319
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:36,942
As of right now, Osaka's been canceled.

320
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:42,948
As of right now, Osaka's been canceled.

321
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:48,387
{\an8}<i>Due to the spread
of the novel coronavirus,</i>

322
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:51,323
{\an8}<i>the concert that was planned
to be held a week later</i>

323
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,458
{\an8}<i>in their hometown, Osaka, was canceled.</i>

324
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:55,527
{\an8}<i>Furthermore...</i>

325
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:57,629
This really sucks.

326
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:02,067
I was looking forward
to Osaka and the METROCK.

327
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,737
{\an8}<i>The festival they wanted to perform in,</i>

328

331
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:23,989
<i>JOHNNY'S WEST
was scheduled to perform too.</i>

332
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:31,797
I think guys would like the songs too.

333
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:35,867
It would be nice if people
acknowledged our music at this festival.

334
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:38,737
"JOHNNY'S WEST's got a cool sound."

335
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:43,208
"They got some good songs.
Let's listen to them some more."

336
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:46,511
{\an8}"MACHIGACCHANAI"

337
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:49,114
{\an8}<i>There was one song they wanted to perform.</i>

338
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:53,185
{\an8}WHO KNOWS WHAT WILL HAPPEN TOMORROW

339
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,854
{\an8}NOBODY KNOWS

340
00:20:55,921 --> 00:21:01,560
{\an8}MEETING YOU, BELIEVING IN OUR DREAMS

341
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:05,030
{\an8}BARING OUR FANGS AT THE ANSWER

342
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,399
{\an8}IT'S NOT WRONG

343
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,203
<i>This song represents them.</i>

344
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,039
<i>"A song that would cheer anybody up."</i>

345
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:20,379
We're making more and more preparations.

346
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:23,015
We're adding more things
we can do to our list

347
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:26,985
so we can cram everything
into our performances.

348
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:30,889
It's like having a new dream or purpose.

349
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:34,960
<i>On the next</i> RIDE ON TIME<i>...</i>

350
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:41,266
<i>This group of seven are in high spirits
and have reached a new stage.</i>

351
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:47,039
We're confident
we can show ourselves to anybody.

352
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:51,443
{\an8}<i>There was some unforeseen trouble too.</i>

353
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,544
{\an8}Thank you.

354
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:58,750
{\an8}But people who laugh when they're sad
are so much stronger.

355
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:01,119
{\an8}Wow...

356
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:03,822
{\an8}<i>They're all testing themselves
in their own areas.</i>

357
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:07,626
{\an8}"Should I be here?"
That's what I'm wondering.

358
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:12,497
{\an8}I'm going to do my best to perform so
people can say that I was the best.

359
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:16,201
{\an8}<i>Where do they get this energy from?</i>
