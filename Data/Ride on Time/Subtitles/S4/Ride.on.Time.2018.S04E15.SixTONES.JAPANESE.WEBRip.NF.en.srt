{\an8}<i>Production for a new song was ramped up
for the release of their new album.</i>

5
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:33,566
I was thinking that you could all

6
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:36,970
give this dance a go
maybe five or six times.

7
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,304
Copy that.

8
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:42,675
Although, we'll see
if we have the stamina.

9
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:47,147
But if you guys want to
make some cuts, that's fine.

10
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,649
No, we're fine. Whichever is easiest.

11
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,351
Okay, copy that.

12
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:53,420
We'll do the opposite.

13
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:55,388
We do things the hard way.

00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:40,834
People said how great our first album was.
And I loved hearing that.

18
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,170
However, it raises the bar
for the second one.

19
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:48,541
We have to take inspiration
from all sorts of places

20
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:51,644
and put in the second album
to surpass our first.

21
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:54,314
That's what I think.

22
00:01:56,082 --> 00:01:59,853

{\an8}I can't get that low.

27
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:03,650

Yeah.

It wasn't quite it.

40
00:03:57,637 --> 00:03:59,405
Yeah, the feeling. It was low.

41
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:02,475
I want to get it right.

42
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:04,477

00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,031
Good work.

46
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,866
Good job today.

47
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:30,169
Do you think I can listen to a rough cut?

48
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:31,871
Yeah, sure.

49
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:52,492
Kochi has such a kind voice.

50
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:54,861
-You know?
-For sure.

51
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:58,064
He seems really sunny.

52
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,867
More kind than sunny, actually.

53
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:02,135
A good person.

54
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:03,970
He sounds like a good person.

55
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,874
My voice is a nag.

56
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,976
-You think so?
-No way.

57
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,311
A nag?

58
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:12,979
It seems sensitive.

59
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:13,880
Oh.

60
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,116
Any retakes needed?

61
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:19,652
I'm up for it if there are.

62
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:21,287

66
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:39,572
Okay.

00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:48,281

68
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,382
-Yeah.

69
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:51,117
-Something more wild.
-Okay.

70
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,725
Great. Let's listen to that.

71
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:07,900
Perfect!

72
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:12,338
It's like it was hammered into your body,
so it's going really fast.

73
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,641
I did do a lot yesterday.

74
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,744
You did? You did a lot?

75
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,412
I did so much yesterday.

76
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:22,582
-I guess you did choreography. Right.
-Yeah, choreography.

77
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:26,419
Since we debuted,

78
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:31,991
we've had the privilege of
showcasing our singles on music programs.

79
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:37,363
I guess the bar is set really high.

80
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:41,200
Like we're part of something big.

81
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,637
You know?

82
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:49,675
So sometimes I'd think
I didn't do enough to prepare.

83
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:52,145
I'm 27 now, and I wonder

84
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:57,250
how many skills I can learn by 30.

85
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:05,091
{\an8}What do you think
your strengths are with singing?

86
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,162
With singing?

87
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,803
Well, among the SixTONES members,

88
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:21,140
I feel like
I have the best sense of rhythm.

89
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:24,477
That goes for everything, like jump rope.

90
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,647
I just really hate my own voice.

91
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:29,849
I only listen to the guide track.

92
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,617
I keep my voice volume low.

93
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:38,691
There's a cue box that lets you
hear your own voice,

94
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:45,031
I just listen to
the guide voice track at full volume.

95
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:49,469
But I was told
when I started going to lessons,

96
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:51,971
that it's important to accept my voice.

97
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:53,206
That made sense.

98
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:54,907
So I started accepting it.

99
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:59,412
I can tolerate my speaking, but I'm still
not comfortable with my singing.

100
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:01,047
Not yet.

101
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,172
Shinataro has a killer voice.

102
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,608
Yes, it's really sexy.

103
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:29,509
Thank you.

104
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,210
But I hate it.

105
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:33,946
I see.

106
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,115
{\an8}Okay, here we go!

-October?
-Twenty-eight.

{\an8}<i>Taiga Kyomoto was also starring
in a musical at this time.</i>

114
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:24,130
<i>He kept talking to a minimum
in order to save his voice for the stage.</i>

115
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:32,371
<i>Being cautious, they did the recording
before the show opened.</i>

116
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:33,639
Hello.

117
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,577
You look tired.

118
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:39,278
You look well.

119
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:40,746
You seem really well.

120
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:43,249
Sorry, I meant the opposite.

121
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,384
So energetic!

122
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:50,523
So dumb.

123
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,893
How's your throat?

124
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,328
Or is it more your body?

125
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:58,331
My throat is...

126
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,167
I'm up for it.

127
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:02,501
Yeah.

128
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:07,373
But we'll be running full dress
rehearsals until the show,

129
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:11,143
so if I mess up my throat,
I won't have time to rest it.

130
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,245
I see.

131
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:15,448
It's just gonna be full on.

132
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:21,387
I'm not in great condition,
but I can still get on stage.

133
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:25,291
If I think about doing the play
for the next month,

134
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:28,060
I have to be conservative.

135
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:33,032
<i>Being able to hit high notes,</i>

136
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:36,102
<i>Kyomoto had an important part
to play in this song.</i>

137
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:47,880
Will I hit it?

138
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:50,249
The top note is B, as in A, B.

139
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,150
I can do that.

140
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:52,551
If you're on form.

141
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:55,254
-It's feeling super high.
-True.

142
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,288
It's magic.

143
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:58,557
Yeah, B shows up twice.

144
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:00,626
-I can do it.
-Yeah.

145
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:03,462
-Let's give it a shot.
-Okay.

146
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:17,376
Hm?

147
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:23,249
Should we do it?

148
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:25,117
Can you do the Buddha pose?

149
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,552
-Wanna do it?
-Oh, this pose?

150
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:32,024
I'll give this a go.

151
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:41,934
Nope.

152
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,004
-Let me go again.
-Okay.

153
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:46,672
I'll put it under my heels.

154
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:48,507
Go for it.

155
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:50,042
-I'm ready.
-Let's go.

156
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:05,057
-Cool.
-Felt good.

157
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:06,058
Listen to it.

158
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,293
Can I try that again?

159
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:09,562
-Sure, of course.
-Awesome.

160
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:28,180
So cool! Let's hear it.

161
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,549
This is bad, I end up going all out.

162
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:32,017
Right?

163
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:32,952
Please stop me.

164
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:34,320
Okay, we will.

165
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:40,860
You'll never be able to air this.

166
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:41,894
No?

167
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:45,498
You can't air me abusing
rolls of tape like this.

168
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:48,367
But it helped create a beautiful song.

169
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,703
That makes it an effective use.

170
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,139
It's not the right way.

171
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:55,808
-I'm sorry about the tape.
-Oh, right.

172
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,143
-Sorry.
-Look at that.

173
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:58,878
-Wow.
-Sorry.

174
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,380
It can still be used.

175
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:04,183
It's still adhesive.

176
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:12,691
Taiga-san, do you like your own voice?

177
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:20,399
I wonder.

178
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:29,241
I don't especially like my voice,

179
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:33,646
but there's a voice of mine that I like.

180
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:38,150
I don't really like my talking voice.

181
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,320
And my singing voice

182
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:47,226
there's some frustration that it sometimes
doesn't match the songs I like.

183
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:53,732
Jesse always tells me he's envious of
my voice because of how high I can go.

184
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:58,737
But from my perspective,

185
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:01,841
I think Jesse is so cool
because he can do things I can't

186
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:04,643
like sing in English and hit low notes.

187
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:08,214
We both have different strengths.

188
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:14,987
I guess the grass
is always greener with voices.

189
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:41,013
{\an8}JESSIE (25)

190
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:45,618
{\an8}Some people might think you're good
because you can hit low notes,

191
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:49,822
{\an8}while others think hitting high notes
make you good.

192
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:55,594
Or some may value
being able to convey a feeling.

193
00:14:56,395 --> 00:15:00,099
I'd be happy if any of those fit me.

194
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:05,070
Which would you like?

195
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,673
I can't hit high notes.

196
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,943
I'm envious of Taiga.

197
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,045
I wish I could do that.

198
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:16,348
-Because he can hit high notes?
-Yeah.

199
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:27,126
<i>For him, singing was something
that gave him joy.</i>

200
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:30,996
Hello.

201
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,467
Goodbye then.

202
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:38,637
Let us in.

203
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:44,276
<i>He chose a famous song
by someone he loves and respects.</i>

204
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:59,425
MELODY KOJI TAMAKI

205
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:52,978
Why do you know Koji Tamaki so well?

206
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,080
Because I love him.

207
00:16:56,248 --> 00:17:01,186
It started when I saw him on music
programs my grandpa and grandma watched.

208
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:03,489
I'd see clips when I was little.

209
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:08,327
I started looking him up myself,
and finally got to see him live last year.

210
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:11,296
I cried before he even got on stage.

211
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:15,901
I couldn't see him at all
through my tears.

212
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:17,302
You know? Like...

213
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:36,955
For the last hook,
just play around with it and adlib stuff.

214
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:37,856
Okay.

215
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:38,891
Just wing it.

216
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:39,792
Okay.

217
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:41,693
-I'll start two lines earlier.
-Okay.

218
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,298
That was great.

219
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:20,466
Perfect.

220
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:22,668
Thanks, we got it.

221
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:24,303
There's no right answer.

222
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:25,571
That was great.

223
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:29,007
Well, I wonder what Mr. Tamaki would do.

224
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:33,512
I want to see him.

225
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:37,816
I bet you could.

226
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:41,487
I wonder where he is.

227
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:46,658
Where could he be?

228
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:11,150
JURI TANAKA (26)

229
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:21,960
Jesse's so cool.

230
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:26,198
<i>Juri Tanaka is in charge of rapping.</i>

231
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:29,868
<i>He talked to us about their voices.</i>

232
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:08,173
I like my own voice.

233
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,910
That's why I listen to the song.

234
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:17,216
It's a voice that sounds unsettling
when you hear it as a sound.

235
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:21,386
Or rather, my voice is
really good at lingering.

236
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:27,025
I want to give meaning
for the six of us to sing.

237
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:34,700
If our voices were all uniform and
came together in one big, pretty voice,

238
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:39,004
then only the one
with the best voice needs to sing.

239
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:45,344
But since there's six of us,
there's meaning if we're all different.

240
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:07,532
JANUARY 2022
YOKOHAMA ARENA

241
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:19,511
So the other five members can
cover for me to make the sounds I can't.

242
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:22,114
Bring it in.

243
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,216
Alright, bring it in.

244
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,084
Yo.

245
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,455
Even Juri's rapping,

246
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:33,225
or Shintaro's sweet voice.

247
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:37,562
We all have our own
unique character in our voices.

248
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:43,568
I can't imagine not singing together.

249
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:55,380
{\an8}<i>Next time, it's the big concert.</i>

250
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:59,351
{\an8}If SixTONES disbands,
I'll have no reason to try hard.

251
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:03,455
{\an8}I'm so grateful to have been taught
about this world.

252
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:05,557
{\an8}We're most at ease during concerts.

253
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:09,661
{\an8}Whatever we do, the fans will come see us
because they want to.

254
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:14,733
{\an8}I'll give it a spin.

255
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:17,869
