{\an8}<i>Last year's summer.</i>

00:00:04,704 --> 00:00:08,675
{\an8}<i>SixTONES 2020 CD debut has been confirmed.</i>

3
00:00:09,642 --> 00:00:10,543
Congratulations!

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:11,978
Big smiles!

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,849
<i>They've made it here</i>

6
00:00:15,915 --> 00:00:19,119
{\an8}<i>with a variety of things on their minds.</i>

7
00:00:22,655 --> 00:00:23,623
{\an8}My grandma,

8
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,027
{\an8}she went to the shrine every morning.

{\an8}TAIGA KYOMOTO (25)

10
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:31,031
{\an8}Every morning for more than ten years.

11
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:35,235
Just to pray that we would make our debut.

12
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:37,637
She's so happy for us.

13
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:40,607
So, from that perspective,
making our debut

14
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:46,579
feels like I'm paying back the kindness
of lots of different people.

15
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,452
And I feel mentally prepared to take

16
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:53,887
that next step forward.

17
00:00:57,924 --> 00:00:59,526
<i>At the end of last year,</i>

18
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:03,329
<i>they released a music video
in advance of their CD.</i>

19
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:07,434
<i>Yoshiki from X Japan
wrote the music and lyrics for it.</i>

20
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:13,139
<i>Each one of the six</i>

21
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:17,610
<i>felt what it was like to be standing
on this new kind of stage.</i>

22
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:21,781
Yeah. I'm right in the middle!

JESSE (23)

24
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:26,052
We were late to debut,

25
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:28,421
but I think this is a good time to do it.

26
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:35,295
<i>These six rough diamonds
are shining brighter and brighter...</i>

27
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:41,634
<i>as they surge onward
into an unknown world.</i>

00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,097

{\an8}<i>October.</i>

31
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:14,501

{\an8}KOKUSAI HALL, KOBE INTERNATIONAL HOUSE

34
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:23,510
Why have you got so much, Kochi?

35
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:24,777
Aren't you on a diet?

36
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:25,812
You're the same.

37
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,480
I can't help it in the mornings.

38
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:29,315
Why are you picking on me?

39
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:30,517
When did you get up?

40
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,719
About 6:40 a.m.

41
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:34,420
{\an8}-That's so early!
-I couldn't sleep.

{\an8}YUGO KOCHI (25)

43
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:38,124
{\an8}I was like 9:00, 9:30.

44
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:39,459
{\an8}I got up at 9:30.

45
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:40,894
You're oversleeping.

46
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,028
I get up at 9:30...

47
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:44,197
<i>They arrived the day before.</i>

48
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:47,167

they always stay in pairs.</i>

{\an8}SHINTARO MORIMOTO (22)

50
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:51,437
Did I snore, Juri?

51
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:52,505
Really loudly.

52
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:55,308
By the way,
were you getting up every hour?

53
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,209
Yeah.

54
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:57,477
{\an8}JURI TANAKA (24)
HOKUTO MATSUMURA (24)

55
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:59,479
{\an8}You did it once every hour
of sleep you had.

56
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:01,347
{\an8}One snore per set.

57
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:02,582
{\an8}-One snore?
-For real?

58
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,319
Then you'd be quiet for ten minutes or so.

59
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:09,389
Then you'd get up, mumbling something.

60
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:11,357
-Did you keep waking me up?
-Yeah.

61
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:13,193
Why did you do that?

62
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:16,896
Well, I was kind of making your bed
into a coffin.

63
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,366
This guy!

64
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:23,803
If I am sleeping neatly in the middle,

65
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,805
you know those long, round cushions?

66
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,640
He puts them next to me

67
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:31,077
to turn my bed into a little coffin.

68
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:37,784
<i>It's their first gig
in front of their fans</i>

69
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,253
<i>since they announced
their debut in August.</i>

70
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:44,057
-Let's make it a good show!
-Thank you!

71
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:46,693
-Let's do this! Thanks!
-We're counting on you!

72
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:49,529
All right. Thank you.

73
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:02,075
{\an8}<i>Full of individual characters,</i>

74
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:04,043
{\an8}<i>SixTONES is aiming for great heights.</i>

75
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:06,646
{\an8}<i>The group's debut may be confirmed,</i>

76
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:09,682
{\an8}<i>but their provocative performances
remain unchanged.</i>

77
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,053
Make some noise!

78
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:20,960
{\an8}<i>All of them have been active
in Johnny's Jr. for over ten years.</i>

79
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:24,998
{\an8}<i>These shows, which they perform
throughout the year,</i>

80
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:27,433
{\an8}<i>will be the last they do as juniors.</i>

81
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,239
{\an8}-Morning.
-Good morning.

82
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,341
{\an8}<i>The preparations for their debut
have also begun.</i>

{\an8}OCTOBER
SONY MUSIC STUDIOS

84
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:37,910
{\an8}Awesome!

85
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:39,479
{\an8}<i>Today,</i>

86
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:42,115
{\an8}<i>it's the long-awaited recording
of their debut track.</i>

87
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:48,588
<i>They've all listened to the demo tape.</i>

88
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:50,990
Can we keep the demo playing?

89
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:52,025
Play it once.

90
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:53,493
Can we use the whole thing?

91
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:54,961
This? We won't use it.

92
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,933
<i>Seeing a record label studio
for the first time,</i>

93
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,568
<i>they're filled with curiosity.</i>

94
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:07,807
<i>Recording a song here
is another signifier of making a debut.</i>

95
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:14,514
We're all here.

96
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,053
<i>Ever since he heard the demo tape,</i>

97
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:23,656
<i>Kyomoto has been unable
to contain his eagerness to sing it.</i>

98
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:20,813
Wow! The goosebumps.

99
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,582
That gave me goosebumps.

100
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:24,884
-The vibrato timing was perfect.
-Thank you.

101
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:26,652
Okay, one more take like that.

102
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:27,553
Okay.

103
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,794
-Okay.
-Which do you prefer?

104
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:39,232
Vibrato at the end?

105
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:40,500
Yeah.

106
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:48,274
Yeah, on the long "wo,"

107
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:50,643
and the "mo," you're taking it down.

108
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:52,979
-Sorry, Jesse, this is the last one.
-Okay.

109
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:56,549
Depending on if we go with Kyomoto's
natural voice or falsetto,

110
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,818
-our approach here will change.
-Right.

111
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:00,820
-I want to prepare for all scenarios.
-Okay.

112
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:05,591
<i>The second half of the song,
when it builds up,</i>

113
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:07,293
<i>features a solo by Kyomoto.</i>

114
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:11,230
<i>The original key is high,
and the difficulty is rising.</i>

115
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,435
The song will be better this way for sure.

116
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:17,637
Yeah, it's cool.

117
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:22,275
But if I'm performing live on a bad day,
will I be able to do it?

118
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:23,342
Well...

119
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,213
We'll record it, but...

120
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,883
On the single track,

121
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:34,287
they'll probably realize
that something's different.

122
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:36,456
-They'll notice.
-Yeah.

123
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:38,891
I want to take it on, though!

124
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:43,095
-You want to take on the original key.
-What do we do?

125
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,067
That's it.

126
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:51,604
Yes. You're in excellent form, Kyomo.

127
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,172
-Who said that?
-Shin-chan.

128
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:55,341
-Shintaro?
-That's right.

129
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:56,809
-Splendid.
-I'm so scared!

130
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,846
This decision could ruin my life.

131
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,882
It really could.

132
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:05,251
I'll have to do it this way for life.

133
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:10,356
Challenging myself here could mean
I'll have nights that I cry.

134
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:12,058
We can always redo it.

135
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:16,929
Let's do the original key.

136
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,832
-Okay! Yeah!
-Yeah!

137
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,303
When I can't sing it anymore,
it's time to retire.

138
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,874
When that happens, take it down an octave.

139
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,076
Will it be tough for you today?

140
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:31,844
No, it's fine.

141
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:36,515
But when I do musicals or singing shows,
too, singing this will be scary.

142
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:37,583
Definitely.

143
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,418
It's fine if I'm in good condition.

144
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:41,654
Don't think so far ahead, Kyomo.

145
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:45,892
-Focus on the job at hand.
-Original key.

146
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:49,896
-Okay! Very cool.
-Very cool.

147
00:08:57,803 --> 00:09:01,173
<i>Even after the recording,
the members carry on singing.</i>

148
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,109
<i>Their debut is starting to feel real.</i>

149
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:11,651
Won't it be awesome if this is on karaoke?

150
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,587
-I just thought that, too!
-I just thought it!

151
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:17,857
What if I'm with friends,
maybe to celebrate the start of a show,

152
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:19,859
and they go, "Sing this, Taiga!"?

153
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:21,561
Will I be able to?

154
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:23,529
Just take it down a half-note.

155
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:28,901
But I think that's one of the hardest
songs for a young group like us.

156
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:31,470
-Definitely.
-If we have to do a debut song medley.

157
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:35,875
I don't remember many groups debuting
with a song like this.

158
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:37,476
Not in Johnny's.

159
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:39,612
That's why I really like it.

160
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:42,515
It works with how people see SixTONES.

161
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:45,184
-How so?
-It took us so long to debut

162
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,987
-that we ended up as adults.
-Right.

163
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:51,190
I think the song gives that meaning.
It's great.

164
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:52,692
It's like...

165
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,027
You associate debuts with youth.

166
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:59,665
It's something you can't separate
a childish association from.

167
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:01,801
So, I think it's great that, as adults,

168
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:04,770
we can release a debut song like this.

169
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:05,905
That's how I see it.

170
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:09,909
-Will it sell well?
-You bet.

171
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,245
-Thanks!
-Thanks!

172
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:16,716
-Is it one?
-No.

173
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:20,519
<i>The preparations for their debut
are getting ever more frantic.</i>

174
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:26,158
<i>The choreography for the music video
has been completed.</i>

175
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:29,095
I like that! It's easy to understand.

176
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:39,405
<i>They're shown footage of the dances
by the choreographer.</i>

177
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:00,192
-Whoa!
-Cool!

178
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,977
<i>They're totally absorbed in it.</i>

179
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:25,551
<i>Once the song and lyrics become one,
their expression is born.</i>

180
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,889
That looks tricky!

181
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:38,864
This piano here, and this piano here.

182
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:41,000
Then here.

183
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:42,234
Not too high.

184
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:50,910
Let's go!

185
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:55,681
Kochi!

186
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:58,184
That's it!

187
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,042
Left leg?

188
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,185
Not yet.

189
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:36,489
-Slowly, now.
-Crouch at the last second.

190
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:38,424
<i>Compared to his band mates,</i>

191
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,292
<i>Kochi is struggling.</i>

192
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:45,264
It's like we're moving too fast.

193
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:47,066
It is fast.

194
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:49,969
It's only been an hour,
but you've done over half of it.

195
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:51,470
Really fast.

196
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:56,108
Show me how to do it, Mr. One-Take.

197
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:58,778
Though I'm sure it's hard for you, too.

198
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,252
<i>He's practicing during his break.</i>

199
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:07,486
One more time.

200
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:08,754
Kochi, it's best

201
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:11,290
if you don't raise your upper body
too much.

202
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,392
I'm just memorizing it now. Later.

203
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,393
Okay, sure.

204
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,628
Next...

205
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,932
-Want to give it a go?
-Let's try with the music, please.

206
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,845
-One.
-Oh, that's one?

207
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,481
One, two, three, four,

208
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:37,650
and five, six, seven, eight.

209
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,066
{\an8}YUGO KOCHI
JOINS AGENCY IN MAY 2009

210
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:57,570
{\an8}<i>Kochi joined the agency at the age of 15.</i>

211
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:01,874
{\an8}<i>By Johnny's standards,
this may have been a late start.</i>

212
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:10,816
This town has really looked after me,
ever since I was at school.

213
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:14,420
If I went to see a movie
in elementary school,

214
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:16,856
I would always come here.

215
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:20,025
It's been ages since I walked down here!

216
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:24,697
Was it raining?

217
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:29,735
<i>With their debut lined up,
we've invited Kochi</i>

218
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:33,405
<i>to his familiar Yokohama
for a long, relaxed chat.</i>

219
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:38,377
<i>This is an old favorite spot of his.</i>

220
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:41,614
It's hot!

221
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:47,887
<i>Kochi has been told the same thing
repeatedly since joining Johnny's.</i>

222
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,624
Since SixTONES formed,

223
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:54,059
people have told me
just being present is enough.

224
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:57,029
"No, I want to work," I say.

225
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:59,398
"What can I be doing?"

226
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:02,835
What do you do
if you're told just to be there?

227
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,303
Was it a shock?

228
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,938
It's not so much a shock...

229
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:08,941
Is it more just wondering what you can do?

230
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:10,776
But...

231
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,746
But that's how it is, though.

232
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:19,685
Nevertheless, I still think
about all sorts of things to myself.

233
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:29,862
Yeah. About being in a boy band,
about working hard on my dancing.

234
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:34,466
I've done a great deal of soul-searching.

235
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,802
I'm conscious of the fact that I want

236
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:38,404
to be necessary somehow.

237
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,373
I want to do my best with that,

238
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,275
but did Mr. Johnny want me to say that?

239
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:45,945
I wonder about that as I'm doing all this.

240
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:48,781
{\an8}SIXTONES FORM IN 2015

241
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:51,650
{\an8}<i>When he was unsure
if he should carry on being an idol,</i>

242
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:55,754
{\an8}<i>as he'd started college
and was thinking about his future,</i>

243
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:57,756
{\an8}<i>SixTONES was formed.</i>

244
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:05,197
What is interesting is that
we all made the same resolution.

245
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:07,132
That if it failed, we would quit.

246
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,370
That was a unanimous group decision.

247
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:15,207
But we all liked being with the agency
and didn't want to quit.

248
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:19,678
It was significant that we shared
this do-or-die situation

249
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:20,980
with each other.

250
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:24,817
If the members of a group
don't trust each other,

251
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:28,620
you'll just fall apart
bit by bit, I think.

252
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:34,994
Our bonds won't let something
like that happen.

253
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:39,031
If SixTONES ceased to be,

254
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:43,335
it would be awful.
I don't want to think about it.

255
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:46,305
I can't think about it.

256
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:47,639
I won't let that happen.

257
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,275
I'll stop it happening somehow or other.

258
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,587
Rock, paper, scissors.

259
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:03,222
Again.

260
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:06,625
<i>Each of the members
has something precious to them.</i>

261
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,827
This is going in, just watch.

262
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:13,766
<i>Tanaka has also returned home
to spend some time with his friends.</i>

263
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,503
Johnny's people always score on TV.

264
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:20,272
I'm the kind of player who never scores.

265
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,373
But Johnny's...

266
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:26,178
{\an8}JURI TANAKA
JOINS AGENCY IN APRIL 2008

267
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:28,313
{\an8}<i>Tanaka was in middle school</i>

268
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,617
{\an8}<i>when he told his friends
he was signing with Johnny's.</i>

269
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:34,019
{\an8}<i>That was 11 years ago.</i>

270
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:39,491
We were really happy for you.

271
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,593
As if it was happening to us.

272
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,661
Weren't we?

273
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,430
Yeah.

274
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:46,165
I bet you didn't know.

275
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,000
You only knew half of it.

276
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,269
-Right.
-Me, too.

277
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:53,005
I don't know how the system works,
you see.

278
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,740
-Right.
-Not really.

279
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:58,177
I thought you were already
fully in that world.

280
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,446
-It was the same with your debut.
-Yeah.

281
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:03,682
Once you joined Johnny's, it was like
you were in show business.

282
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,818
It seemed like a far-off world.

283
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,655
You were close by, but it felt like
you were somewhere else.

284
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:10,989
Right...

285
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:13,358
-Do you know how it works?
-No.

286
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,828
See? He still doesn't understand
the system.

287
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:17,663
He's only interested in Sandaime.

288
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:21,100
Have you done Yakult?

289
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:25,871
-Yakult...
-That was crazy.

290
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:30,576
<i>Tanaka has also arranged
to see someone else dear to him.</i>

291
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:34,746
She still comes to our gigs and things.

292
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:38,517
And she always messages me when I'm on TV.

293
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:42,387
It really does encourage me.

294
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:50,796
<i>There's someone Tanaka wants to see.</i>

295
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,632
It must be about three or four years.

296
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:55,234
That's a long time.

297
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,102
She's come to gigs,

298
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:59,338
but we haven't met one-on-one.

299
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:05,677
-There you are!
-Oh!

300
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:07,946
Wow! Good evening!

301
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:11,383
-I'm surprised you could tell it was us.
-Well, it's a big car.

302
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,252
Wait a minute! Hang on!

303
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,053
This was my middle school teacher.

304
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,523
{\an8}-In second and third year.
-Second and third?

305
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:20,626
{\an8}I think he's where he is now
because of the choir contests

306
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:23,295
{\an8}he worked so hard for
in second and third year.

307
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:24,530
{\an8}HOMEROOM TEACHER
MRS. SATO

308
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:27,499
I'm always checking up on you.

309
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:29,501
I know, you always message me!

310
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:31,770
I "like" your posts.

311
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,740
And when your fans post things,

312
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:37,776
I "like" each one like this.

313
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,312
And she knows I threw pasta
at the blackboard.

314
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:43,382
-It was the ceiling, not the blackboard.
-Was it?

315
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,285
It stuck to the ceiling!

316
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:49,721
No, no, I'm so pleased for you.

317
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:53,825
She sent me a message congratulating us
on our debut, too.

318
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:58,063
I thought it was so brilliant.
I was so happy for you.

319
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,965
You've worked so hard for so long.

320
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,033
I didn't study,

321
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:03,835
-but I went to school.
-Yes.

322
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:07,072
You got along with everyone. You did well.

323
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:09,374
-I did.
-Yeah!

324
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:12,177
-You were a regular kid.
-I was.

325
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:13,745
Just a regular kid.

326
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:15,914
You seemed to value your friends, too.

327
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:17,549
Yes, I still see them now.

328
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:22,120
Are you the le... leader of the group?

329
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:24,256
No, not at all!

330
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:27,492
-But...
-Are you thinking of Kondo or Yudai?

331
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,493
-No.
-Who, then?

332
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,495
-SixTONES.
-SixTONES?

333
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,466
-I'm not the leader of SixTONES at all.
-What are you?

334
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:37,069
I have a role a bit like that.

335
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:38,003
I knew it!

336
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,038
But I'm not the leader.

337
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:43,175
The leader of Kondo and Yudai!

338
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,144
My head's just full of stuff
from back home right now.

339
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:50,582
I'm grateful you've done
all of this, though.

340
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:55,954
It's all due to everything
you've made so far.

341
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:58,557
So, have faith in yourself and keep it up!

342
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:01,260
I've always had faith in myself.

343
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:05,530
But really, though. Yeah.

344
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:08,900
Don't forget to be grateful
for everything as you go.

345
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:09,835
-Okay.
-Yeah.

346
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,272
-Bye.
-Bye.

347
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:15,040
-Thank you.
-See you.

348
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,108
-Bye.
-Bye.

349
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:18,176
I'll be cheering you on!

350
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,181
That brought back memories.

351
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,758
A lot of memories.

352
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:37,396
Nothing's changed in all this time.

353
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:39,364
Everyone's the same.

354
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:50,375
{\an8}<i>On the next</i> Ride On Time<i>...</i>

355
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:00,419
{\an8}<i>SixTONES sing a song of resolution.</i>

356
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:03,422
{\an8}SixTONES want to be like SixTONES.

357
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:04,756
{\an8}And being like SixTONES

358
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,992
{\an8}is something we won't compromise on.

359
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:10,162
{\an8}If it's for the other five's sake,
I'd fight all on my own.

360
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:15,500
It felt like the dots had been connected
for the final "Imitation Rain."

361
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:16,902
