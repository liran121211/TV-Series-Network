and in what order</i>

173
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:53,926
<i>all have to be made by them.</i>

174
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:58,064
But "Summer Station" is "Summer Station,"
you know.

175
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:01,567
Having "Kimi-iro Omoi" in part C
seems strange.

176
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:04,470
But I think it should be okay in A.

177
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:07,673
I think it's really important
that we do our old songs.

178
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:11,677
<i>It's at this moment...</i>

179
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:20,620
{\an8}<i>that their rival unit
starts practicing next to them.</i>

180
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:26,926
They're good.

181
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:34,333
<i>How can they produce something
that won't be outdone?</i>

182
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:41,307
<i>While he was still alive,
an important man gave them some direction.</i>

183
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:45,811
<i>And that was</i>

184
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:49,448
<i>to incorporate traditional
Japanese performance into their shows.</i>

185
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:57,623
{\an8}<i>If they had overseas ambitions,</i>

186
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,859
{\an8}<i>fusing Japanese and Western elements</i>

187
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:02,061
{\an8}<i>would be sure to come in handy,
he advised.</i>

188
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:14,674
<i>The show is almost upon them.</i>

189
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,876
<i>The rehearsals begin.</i>

JULY 17, EX THEATER

191
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:20,079
Today is a big day.

192
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,717
{\an8}<i>In the Japanese-infused performance,</i>

193
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:26,986
{\an8}<i>Sato has been assigned a big role.</i>

194
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:30,556
<i>Passed down the generations,</i>

195
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:32,491
<i>it's the mask routine.</i>

196
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:40,266
<i>He must be perfectly synchronized
with the other members.</i>

197
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:42,101
You two are in the wrong place.

198
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:47,073
<i>He also has to perform
rapid costume changes.</i>

199
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:52,144
<i>Will he be able to handle it?</i>

200
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:54,580
Thank you.

201
00:11:56,015 --> 00:12:00,086
<i>Around the same time, Iwasaki is deep
in concentration in the theater.</i>

202
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:06,525
{\an8}<i>He's thinking about
a key part of the show.</i>

{\an8}TAISHO IWASAKI

204
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:43,028
<i>Still in high school,
Iwasaki sings a Hibari Misora song.</i>

205
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:47,399
<i>It's become a staple
of every Bi Shonen concert.</i>

206
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:07,153
<i>Why this song?</i>

207
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:08,521
Thanks.

208
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:11,557
<i>It all started</i>

209
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:16,896
<i>when Iwasaki made the decision
to live his life this way.</i>

210
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:20,332
{\an8}<i>MYOJO</i> SEPTEMBER 2015 ISSUE

211
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,102
{\an8}<i>He signed with the agency
at the age of 13.</i>

212
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:26,872
{\an8}<i>He was an inexperienced dancer,
and not a good talker.</i>

213
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:30,543
{\an8}<i>He felt a sense of danger
at having nothing to him,</i>

214
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:34,613
{\an8}<i>and had a certain someone
listen to him sing the only song he liked.</i>

215
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:42,521
I told Mr. Johnny,
"I can sing, listen to this."

216
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:45,791
So I did, and the first time he listened,

217
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:47,626
"You're average," he said.

218
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,095
"Anyone can sing like that."

219
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:55,501
<i>Yet he didn't give up, and took lessons.</i>

220
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:58,437
<i>A year later, he had him listen again.</i>

221
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:00,239
<i>And then...</i>

222
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:04,143
"Why don't you try <i>enka</i>?" he asked,
and I did.

223
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,078
"That's awesome," he said.

224
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,448
I had never thought of doing <i>enka</i>.

225
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:11,217
It came as a surprise.

226
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:14,019
I couldn't believe it.

227
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,656
<i>But he didn't have any doubts.</i>

228
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,359
Something like that,

229
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:24,897
I just had to try it, right?

230
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:29,235
It was something I'd never done before,

231
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:31,370
so I just had to do it

232
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:34,073
and be told if it was any good or not.

233
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:36,942
So, when he said, "Let's try <i>enka</i>,"

234
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:41,313
I just said, "All right," and I sang it.

235
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:45,184
And Mr. Johnny seemed to like it.

236
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,789
<i>The man once said this,</i>

237
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:55,060
<i>"If they have the will,
and they're a wonderful human being,</i>

238
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:57,229
<i>anyone will do.</i>

239
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,232

<i>Iwasaki checks his singing.</i>

247
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:19,578
-A bit fast.
-Yeah.

248
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:28,187
It's subtle, isn't it?

249
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:35,894
<i>How can they convey their emotions?</i>

-Yes.

<i>There will be countless cameras

{\an8}I don't have time to worry about this.

267
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:21,707

-Yeah.
-But I'm excited.

<i>It's the man who brought him
onto the path of singing.</i>

291

<i>He'll be singing this man's treasured song</i>

<i>in front of everyone here today.</i>

293
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:15,454

<i>Who will Iwasaki think of

298
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:32,671
It's a great song.

299
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:35,774
There are lots of "you"s
it could be about.

300
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:41,847
But for me,
it's definitely about Mr. Johnny.

301
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:44,516
I think he will come to mind
as soon as I start.

302
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:47,886
A lot of memories.

303
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:53,559
<i>At this moment, perhaps,</i>

304
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:58,263

00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:01,727
-Huh?
-When you sang.

308
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:03,629
Which song do you mean?

309
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:05,897
What? Give me a break.

310
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:07,532
It was sweat.
