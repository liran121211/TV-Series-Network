Props are crucial to acting.

102

Whether it be a bag of food you bought,

103
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:22,508

I'm sure that other members
felt the same way, too.

117

But that became our springboard.

118
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:29,942
It taught us not to sulk.

119
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,544
It fueled us to work harder.

120

It really lit our determination on fire.

121

165
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,395
I think you're doing it wrong.

166
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,230
"The girl before"?

167
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,701
Both are grammatically correct.

168
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:45,738
The way you're saying it now,
it's the girl in front of you.

169
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:47,239
In front?

170
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:50,576
If you mean "from before,"
it's the latter intonation.

171
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,113
Just like the girl before.

172
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:58,117
You create one girl after the other.

173
00:11:58,184 --> 00:11:59,719
Just like the girl before.

174
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:02,722
Yes. That sounds clearer.

175
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:08,027
You and your family...

176
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:12,398
<i>There is a creed that Kitayama holds</i>

177
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:14,734
<i>when he is working alone
and away from the group.</i>

178
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:19,238
I'll have them take care of it.

179
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:25,611
I wouldn't get individual gigs
if it weren't for Kisumai.

180
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:31,617
So in the end, it's all for the group.

181
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:34,920
It's the same for all of us.

182
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,191
If we become selfish,

183
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:42,928
the group will fall apart.

184
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:53,506
I can be on TV and in movies
because I'm a part of Kisumai.

185
00:12:57,576 --> 00:13:02,014
We're a bunch of ordinary guys.

186
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:06,252
We tried to figure out
how we could become popular.

187
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,657
Then we had a CD debut.

188
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:13,959
Then, we did a show at Tokyo Dome.

189
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:22,234
We even have our own TV show.

190
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:28,741
How cool is that?

191
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:37,216
{\an8}<i>Fujigaya also has an acting gig
in December 2019.</i>

192
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:47,560
<i>He plays the part of a young man
who has dedicated his life to carpentry.</i>

193
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:52,565
<i>It requires great focus to use the plane.</i>

194
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:00,105
Action!

195
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,055
Cut! Let's check the scene.

196
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:17,289
Thank you.

197
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,926
-It's so difficult.
-Yeah.

198
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:23,062
But I think I'm getting the hang of it.

199
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:25,064
It felt good in the end, didn't it?

200
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:30,870
It feels good because you nail it
when the camera rolls.

201
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,038
I can tell you nailed it.

202
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:39,645
-That was awesome.
-Really?

203
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:42,848
I have a wonderful teacher.

204
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:45,517
I somehow managed.

205
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:49,255
I'm not good with my hands.

206
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:56,428
It's so difficult.
It takes a lot of practice.

207
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:03,669
In this profession,
you rarely get praised.

208
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:07,339
I was really flattered.

209
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:11,710
{\an8}TAISUKE FUJIGAYA

210
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:15,915
{\an8}<i>Fujigaya joined Johnny's
when he was 11 years old.</i>

211
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:18,784
{\an8}<i>He always sought the praise
of a certain man.</i>

212
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:22,888
{\an8}<i>He was Fujigaya's mentor
and father-figure.</i>

213
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:26,926
{\an8}<i>That man loved musicals.</i>

214
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:32,932
{\an8}REHEARSAL FOR MUSICAL <i>DON JUAN</i>

215
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:36,535
{\an8}<i>Then in 2019,
Fujigaya was able to star in a musical.</i>

216
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:51,283
<i>It is the story of a lady's man
who finds true love.</i>

217
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,919
<i>Fujigaya was playing the lead role.</i>

218
00:15:58,023 --> 00:15:59,692
We don't have a mark for you.

219
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:01,327
-Are you okay with that?
-Yes.

220
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:04,229
You can just rush in and rush out.

221
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,332
How does the choreography go after this?

222
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,737
<i>The story is set in Spain.</i>

223
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:14,940
<i>Fujigaya must learn to dance the flamenco.</i>

224
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,981
What's the most difficult part?

225
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:24,283
What? Everything.

226
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,085
This is all new to me.

227
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:27,853
It's tough.

228
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:34,893
<i>Food is his escape
between demanding rehearsals.</i>

229
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:38,030
I really want fried chicken.

230
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,473
<i>However, Fujigaya must
lose weight for the role,</i>

231
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:49,808
<i>so he can only eat salad.</i>

232
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:58,317
<i>Fujigaya has had difficulty singing
as a musical actor.</i>

233
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:00,986
Singing in English goes like this.

234
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:03,756
Light. "T."

235
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:06,058
It often ends with a consonant.

236
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:09,862
You want the energy of the word
to travel during this space.

237
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:14,366
It makes the music more sentimental.

238
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:19,571
-I see what you mean.
-You need to punctuate it.

239
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:20,839
This is tough.

240
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:23,409
This is what you're missing here.

241
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:25,978
You have gotten better at it today.

242
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:30,816
Enunciate the entire word.

243
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,318
Use the entire word to express yourself.

244
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:40,259
<i>This is Fujigaya's first musical.</i>

245
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:43,762
<i>How will he deliver the role?</i>

246
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:55,474
<i>Fujigaya from Kisumai is starring in
a musical for the first time...</i> Don Juan.

247
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:07,719
<i>It is moments before the curtain rises.</i>

248
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:15,761
You don't need to.

249
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:19,832
<i>Fujigaya asks us
to stop the camera for the first time.</i>

250
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:22,868
<i>Then...</i>

251
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:28,006
{\an8}Yes!

252
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:31,844
{\an8}<i>DON JUAN</i> MUSICAL

253
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:35,914
{\an8}<i>During the curtain call on the final show,
Fujigaya speaks to the audience</i>

254
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,250
<i>about his gratitude toward
that certain man.</i>

255
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:42,521
I'm from Johnny's.

256
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:46,625
Mr. Johnny really loved musicals.

257
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:49,394
He passed away
while I was still rehearsing.

258
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:54,766
I was at a loss when he was gone.

259
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:03,342
Mr. Johnny always told us,
"Show must go on."

260
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:09,081
Those words helped me complete
these 30 nights playing Don Juan.

261
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:22,761
<i>Fujigaya had been fighting great pressure.</i>

262
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:28,600
<i>It made him a man of few words,
even with our cameras rolling,</i>

263
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:31,770
<i>but Fujigaya finally opens up.</i>

264
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:37,509
I was scared.

265
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:42,681
But I had faith.

266
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:50,189
I knew Mr. Johnny was watching over me,
which is why I trudged through.

267
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:54,193
I'm glad I didn't run from this challenge.

268
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:56,495
I'm so glad I met this company of actors.

269
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,665
I couldn't be happier.

270
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,433
Thank you.

271
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,602
-Thank you.
-Bye.

272
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,040
{\an8}<i>On the next</i> Ride on Time<i>,
we follow Busaiku.</i>

273
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:15,547
We must prove what we can accomplish
when it's just us four.

274
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:17,649
We are being put to the test.

275
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:22,521
We need to be intelligent,
or soon we will have no gigs.

276
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,893
{\an8}<i>We follow them backstage
as they prepare for their show.</i>

277
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,464
{\an8}This is hard.

278
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:36,301
{\an8}<i>We hang out with junior members,</i>

279
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:41,573
{\an8}<i>and meet a mentor who has supported them

280
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:43,609
{\an8}I've...

281
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:48,146
