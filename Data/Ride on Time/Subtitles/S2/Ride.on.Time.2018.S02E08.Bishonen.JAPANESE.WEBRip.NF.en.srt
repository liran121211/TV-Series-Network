{\an8}LOS ANGELES, USA

2
00:00:02,902 --> 00:00:04,104
{\an8}<i>Summer, 2019.</i>

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:08,241
{\an8}<i>A group of boys have traveled
to Los Angeles, USA.</i>

4
00:00:12,645 --> 00:00:16,483
{\an8}<i>They are the idol unit, Bi Shonen.</i>

5
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,123
{\an8}<i>They are on a journey</i>

6
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:26,526
{\an8}<i>to rediscover the essence
of entertainment.</i>

7
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:30,330
Say cheese.

8
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:31,698
Yes. I got the shot.

9
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:55,922
<i>This is documentary series</i> Ride On Time.

10
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:03,963
{\an8}<i>It is a year of breakthrough
for Bi Shonen.</i>

11
00:01:06,699 --> 00:01:10,537
<i>Five of the six members
are high school students.</i>

12
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:16,042
{\an8}<i>They are recognized
for their performances,</i>

13
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:18,645
{\an8}<i>which are a mixture
of Japanese and Western culture.</i>

14
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:24,017
-Look at each other in the eyes.
-In his eyes?

15
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,151
<i>Let's meet the members.</i>

16
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:28,021
{\an8}<i>Ryuga Sato, tall and handsome.</i>

17
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,557
{\an8}<i>Issei Kanasashi, the youngest member.</i>

18
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:33,927
I've never been filmed
during a photo shoot.

19
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:35,361
I feel shy.

20
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:42,202
{\an8}<i>The most cheerful one of the group,
Hidaka Ukisho.</i>

21
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:44,237
{\an8}Really embarrassing!

22
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:47,640
{\an8}<i>While attending an elite high school,</i>

23
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:51,377
{\an8}<i>Yuto Nasu also lives his life as an idol.</i>

24
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:54,214
This is geography.

25
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,216
I really need to study.

26
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:59,152
<i>One member leads the team</i>

27
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,287
<i>with his abundant dance experience.</i>

28
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:02,489
Face forward.

29
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:05,625
It'll look better
if you bring in your shoulder.

30
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:06,826
{\an8}This is the main part.

31
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:09,929
{\an8}<i>Naoki Fujii,
the oldest member in the unit.</i>

32
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:15,168
{\an8}<i>A boy whose voice is a weapon
unique to Bi Shonen,</i>

33
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:17,070
{\an8}<i>Taisho Iwasaki.</i>

34
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:27,847
<i>On stage, he sings songs
of the great Hibari Misora.</i>

35
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,788
I just had to try it, right?

36
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:40,093
So I just had to do it
and be told if it was any good or not.

37
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:45,798
<i>Bi Shonen is eager for challenges
and has advanced over the years.</i>

38
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:48,768
<i>Now, there is something
the members must learn.</i>

39
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:53,506
<i>What is key
when it comes to conveying emotions?</i>

40
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:59,512
{\an8}<i>They fly to America to find out.</i>

41
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:03,583
{\an8}LITTLE TOKYO

42
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,418
{\an8}<i>A festival is held annually</i>

43
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:09,022
{\an8}<i>in August in LA,
where many Japanese Americans reside.</i>

44
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:18,731
{\an8}<i>It celebrates the culture of the Japanese
and people of Japanese descent.</i>

45
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:25,205
<i>Bi Shonen take part in the festival
as an idol group from Japan.</i>

46
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:29,209
<i>They are scheduled to perform
on two stages.</i>

47
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,582
Is this what it's like to be in a parade?

48
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:39,519
{\an8}We could never do this in Japan.

49
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,821
{\an8}It feels awesome.

50
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:43,957
{\an8}AUGUST 10

51
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:46,492
{\an8}<i>When the Bi Shonen members</i>

52
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:50,363
{\an8}<i>and Shonen Ninja's Nao Oriyama
arrive at their first stage,</i>

53
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,765
{\an8}<i>an unexpected guest surprises them.</i>

54
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,534
Morning!

55
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:56,369
Good morning.

56
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:58,438
-We're Bi Shonen.
-Yeah, I know.

57
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:00,206
How's it going?

58
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:04,844
{\an8}<i>It's Jun Matsumoto of ARASHI
who happened to be in the United States.</i>

59
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:08,982
Can you speak English?

60
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:15,688
<i>The reason why he asked</i>

61
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,558
<i>is because the member must MC
in English today.</i>

62
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:21,661
<i>That's not all.</i>

63
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:24,764
Yes, it's very...

64
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,702
<i>The stage is a simple platform
in the middle of a plaza.</i>

65
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:32,105
<i>A bare-bones stage
with no glitzy lighting.</i>

66
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:35,575
<i>It is the roots of entertainment.</i>

67
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:41,648
<i>Their abilities are being put to the test.</i>

68
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,854
Incredible.
We're doing a live performance in America.

69
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:49,789
You're right.

70
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:54,927
<i>Even the weather is making it difficult
for them to perform</i>

71
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:56,963
<i>their signature hand fan dance.</i>

72
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,303
One more time!

73
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:08,207
<i>The wind is blowing their fans
out of control.</i>

74
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:12,011
Throw it lightly. It's enough.

75
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:14,047
The wind will carry it.

76
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:16,516
One, two. Throw.

77
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:22,922
<i>A fence has been put up
between the audience and the stage,</i>

78
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:26,526
<i>making it difficult to connect
with the crowd.</i>

79
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:35,435
<i>How will they build unity
with the audience?</i>

80
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:42,575
<i>Matsumoto draws upon his experience
to give them advice.</i>

81
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:45,978
Some of you can go in,
then come back on stage.

82
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:47,513
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

83
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:51,451
Just enjoy yourself and have a blast.

84
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,520
When you're feeling it,
it will catch on with the audience, too.

85
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:56,789
-The stage will become friendlier.
-Yes, sir.

86
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:00,059
Thank you for the advice.

87
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:07,133
<i>He teaches them
that the most important thing is passion.</i>

88
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,175
<i>It is time for them to take the stage.</i>

89
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:23,015
<i>Some amateur musicians perform
and set the tone.</i>

90
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:35,261
<i>Bi Shonen must prove their worth
as professionals.</i>

91
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:40,933
<i>It's time.</i>

92
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:51,310
<i>The performance begins
as their senior watches over them.</i>

93
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:02,889
<i>First, they surprise the audience
with a quick costume change.</i>

94
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,862
{\an8}<i>Next, a performance with hand fans.</i>

95
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,202
<i>They manage to pull it off.</i>

96
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:24,377
<i>The opening goes perfectly.</i>

97
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,660
<i>They use Johnny's hit songs
to work up the audience.</i>

98
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:54,674
<i>Still, they do not feel a connection
with the audience.</i>

99
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:01,881
<i>The members take their senior's advice
and join the audience.</i>

100
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:11,257
<i>Much of the American crowd
have never heard of Bi Shonen before.</i>

101
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:19,465
<i>The finale is Bi Shonen's original song.</i>

102
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:21,667
<i>That's when...</i>

103
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,906
Come on!

104
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,757
{\an8}A BI SHONEN ORIGINAL SONG

105
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,951
<i>Even if you don't speak their language</i>

106
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:15,388
<i>if there is passion,
people will understand.</i>

107
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:17,757
Bi Shonen!

108
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,427
I had such a blast!

109
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:22,328
Whoa.

110
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,564
I love the audience here.

111
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,798
It's so different.

112
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:27,400
Incredible.

113
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,637
<i>Their next performance is tomorrow.</i>

114
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:35,207
Oh, this is scarier than I thought.

115
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:38,644
<i>The members go sightseeing
as part of an interview.</i>

116
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:41,881
Whoa!

{\an8}MAGAZINE PHOTO SHOOT

118
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:46,652
{\an8}One, two!

119
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:49,922
{\an8}<i>The members spend their days shuttling
between work and practice.</i>

120
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:54,427
<i>They fight immense pressure
before performances.</i>

121
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:59,966
<i>However, they are no different
from your average teenager.</i>

122
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:04,437
This is plain chocolate and strawberry.

123
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:05,605
They have strawberry.

124
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:06,672
Here.

125
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:09,008
It's so good!

126
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:10,710
Thank you.

127
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:15,514
{\an8}<i>Why was Bi Shonen chosen
to perform at Nisei Week?</i>

128
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:18,117
{\an8}<i>It all started with Iwasaki.</i>

129
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:25,992
I told Mr. Johnny that

130
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:30,730
I wanted to study showmanship
and eventually visit the United States.

131
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,565
Mr. Johnny thought it was hilarious.

132
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:35,735
He was like, "Are you kidding?"

133
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:40,006
He then told me to hold on
and started checking the schedule.

134
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,375
He said, "Okay.

135
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:44,944
If you guys want to go, let's go.

136
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:47,980
But you better give it
your very best shot."

137
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:51,517
<i>The schedule he checked back then</i>

138
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:54,720
<i>was for the Nisei Week Festival.</i>

139
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,961
{\an8}<i>Nisei Week began in 1934.</i>

140
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:05,197
{\an8}<i>He spent his late teens
to twenties in America.</i>

141
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:06,899
{\an8}<i>The festival was dear to him.</i>

{\an8}LITTLE TOKYO, 1930s

143

{\an8}<i>The Japanese who migrated
to the United States</i>

144
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,243
{\an8}<i>faced unimaginable hardships.</i>

145
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:19,612
{\an8}<i>Still, they took root in this land.</i>

146
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:25,151
{\an8}<i>Nisei Week became a point of foundation
for such Japanese immigrants.</i>

147
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:28,320
{\an8}<i>The festival was filled</i>

148
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:31,891
{\an8}<i>with the roots of entertainment
such as song and dance</i>

149
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:34,393

{\an8}<i>The stage Bi Shonen will perform on today</i>

152
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:46,205
{\an8}<i>is the same stage that the Nisei Week

Hello. We're Bi Shonen.

156
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:58,784
<i>This temple is the family home
that he grew up in.</i>

157
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:03,589
<i>When his father worked
as the temple monk here,</i>

158
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,958
<i>many immigrants gathered.</i>

159
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:11,831
<i>And a stage was built
for temple-goers for entertainment</i>

160
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,899
<i>and as a place
to reminisce about their homeland.</i>

161
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:21,540
<i>The members seem emotional,
standing on the stage where it all began.</i>

162
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,344
He lived here as a child?

163
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:26,312
Yep.

164
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,013
Incredible.

165
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,649
I feel that we mustn't taint

166
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:34,353
what Mr. Johnny
and his father have built from here.

167
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:39,492
I want to pay the utmost respect
to the things and people here.

168

<i>Nasu will be speaking in English on stage.
He seems nervous.</i>

to sing the Hibari Misora's songs</i>

171
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:05,384
<i>that were recommended to him.</i>

172
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:15,261
{\an8}<i>Hibari Misora had actally come to
the United States as a child</i>

173
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:18,297
{\an8}<i>and sang on this temple's stage
as part of a tour.</i>

174
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:22,768
{\an8}<i>The man that helped in the production
of that tour</i>

175
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:28,674
<i>was none other than
the man who helped them.</i>

176
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:37,716
<i>It's time for rehearsal.</i>

177
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,320
Are we ready?

178
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:42,788
Yep.

179
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:45,791
Sound check for Taisho.

180
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:47,193
Thank you.

181
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:48,861
-Go ahead.
-Okay.

182
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:05,244
Okay. Thank you.

183
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:10,182
<i>He doesn't seem happy.</i>

184
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:13,085
Can you make the music less loud?

185
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:15,287
Lower the music, please.

186
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,291
<i>One more time.</i>

187
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:34,206
<i>He sings a few times more,
but is still not happy.</i>

188
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:40,412
So sorry to bother you so many times.

189
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:44,617
Can we let Taisho Iwasaki sing
"Ai San San" once more?

190
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:46,385
Sorry. One more time.

191
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,662
<i>This is his seventh try.</i>

192
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:13,979
Sorry. Can we do a sound check
for "Ai San San" one more time?

193
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:18,717
Why did you sound check that song
so many times?

194
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:20,920
I guess...

195
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:24,556
This is a different environment
from usual.

196
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:28,427
I wanted to practice thoroughly
to perform my best.

197
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:32,998
That's why I couldn't give up
on practicing.

198
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:35,267
I want to make sure...

199
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:38,604
that Mr. Johnny can hear me.

200
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:42,141
That's what I hope for.

201
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,946
<i>That man taught them
to always give their best effort.</i>

202
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:50,015
<i>The show is about to start.</i>

203
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,485
{\an8}AUGUST 11
THANK YOU, KOYASAN

204
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:55,454
{\an8}<i>They are counting down the seconds.</i>

205
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:02,061
{\an8}<i>Iwasaki's song is the first act.</i>

206
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:06,131
Will I be able to sing?

207
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,068
You know you can sing.

208
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:12,705
No, I can't. I'm so scared.

209
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,990
<i>First, Nasu addresses the audience.</i>

210
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:49,742
-Come on!
-You can do this!

211
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:00,419
<i>The show begins.</i>

212
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:02,748
<i>Iwasaki has sung this song
for over a year now.</i>

213
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:07,086
<i>He says that recently he has come
to understand something important.</i>

214
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:20,232
In the beginning,
I only thought about singing well.

215
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:23,869
Now, I want my songs
to touch people's hearts.

216
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:29,374
I want to convey to them
what I'm feeling inside.

217
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:41,120
{\an8}<i>The members sing hit songs
created by that special someone</i>

218
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:44,523
<i>like they are carving them
into the stage where it all began.</i>

219
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:32,638
<i>A look of accomplishment
is on their faces.</i>

220
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:35,807
They know that they have done their best.

221
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:44,516
<i>What does Iwasaki think
of his performance?</i>

222
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,120
I'd give me a two.

223
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,454
Really?

224
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:54,526
It's not easy to score full marks.

225
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:55,994
You're right.

226
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:57,996
This is what counts.

227
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:02,100
I need to work on it. I don't have it yet.

228
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,705
Everyone loved the show.

229
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:09,007
The locals came to me
and congratulated me.

230
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:11,343
You did fine. They felt you.

231
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:17,416
<i>It is time to head
to their final destination.</i>

232
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:20,519
<i>The global center of entertainment.</i>

233
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:27,459
<i>The six members arrive
at their final destination of this trip.</i>

234
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:29,661
{\an8}AUGUST 12

235
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,129
{\an8}<i>Las Vegas.</i>

236
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,233
{\an8}<i>They watch some of the world's best shows.</i>

237
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,769
It was amazing.

238
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,105
-What a show.
-Incredible.

239
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:42,341
-Amazing.
-I'm speechless.

240
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:43,408
It was awesome.

241
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:47,713
Now I understand the scope of things
that Mr. Johnny was aiming for.

242
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:49,414
This is what it was.

243
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:52,651
{\an8}Even without words,
they do amazing performances.

244
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:56,221
{\an8}If there is passion,
you can feel it in the audience.

245
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:59,091
{\an8}It made me feel that we have much room
for improvement.

246
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:01,526
{\an8}-Our possibilities are infinite.
-Yep.

247
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,595
{\an8}-We can do it.
-That's the spirit.

248
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:05,631
{\an8}Yeah. I'm going to work harder.

249
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:07,466
{\an8}I'm really going to work harder.

250
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:13,939
{\an8}<i>Their journey has only just begun.</i>

251
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:20,012
<i>On the next</i> Ride On Time<i>...</i>

252
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:22,547
Stop it! You're hurting me!

253
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,616
This is how we roll.

254
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:27,119
We keep going like this
for about ten minutes.

255
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:38,130
{\an8}<i>Taking the world by storm
is a group of strong personalities.</i>

256
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:39,464
{\an8}<i>They are SixTONES.</i>

257
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:41,900
They keep saying it's our turn soon.

258
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,469
Well, it's been 13 years already.

259
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:49,474
The six of us are on a journey together
to make our dreams come true.

260
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:53,645
<i>Finally, it is their turn to shine.</i>

261
00:21:57,783 --> 00:22:01,153
<i>It's a new beginning
that could change their lives.</i>
