{\an8}JANUARY 6, 2020

2
00:00:03,703 --> 00:00:07,007
{\an8}<i>A group of five are together
for the first time in four months.</i>

3
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:10,010
Good morning!

4
00:00:10,076 --> 00:00:13,880
Thank you for allowing the five of us
to do our shoot today.

5
00:00:13,947 --> 00:00:15,015
Thank you!

6
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:16,349
Sorry to disturb you.

7
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:17,717
Please excuse us.

8
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:19,352
{\an8}Thank you.

9
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:20,553
{\an8}Thank you.

10
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,590
{\an8}It's the idol unit HiHi Jets.

11
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:28,895
<i>Today's the all-important
calendar photo shoot.</i>

12
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:35,301
<i>But there's a heavy mood,
and nobody wants to talk.</i>

13
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:47,213
<i>It's due to an incident
that two of the members caused.</i>

14
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:52,018
HIHI JETS' BLOG

15
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:55,522
{\an8}<i>It stopped the group in its tracks.</i>

16
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:57,223
{\an8}FOUR-MONTH WITHDRAWAL FROM ACTIVITY

17
00:00:57,924 --> 00:01:00,727
{\an8}It won't happen again.
Because if it does, it's the end.

18
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:04,064
{\an8}Our dreams are at stake,
as are three of our lives.

19
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:05,131
{\an8}RYUTO SAKUMA

20
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:08,535
{\an8}I didn't think I was too bothered...

21
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:09,502
{\an8}RYO HASHIMOTO

22
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:10,837
{\an8}...by how I was perceived,

23
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,372
but I was so afraid.

24
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,176
I can't sleep at night.

25
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:20,080
Smile!

26
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:25,285
<i>There's somewhere they can't hope to go</i>

27
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:27,320
<i>if there aren't all five of them.</i>

28
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:53,947
<i>This is documentary series</i> Ride On Time.

29
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:01,654
{\an8}<i>This year will be the fifth
since HiHi Jets formed.</i>

30
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:07,393
<i>Their weapon is the roller skate,
a Johnny's tradition.</i>

31
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:13,099
<i>Four of the members are in their teens,</i>

32
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,268
<i>with two of them being in high school.</i>

33
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:20,106
Us in HiHi Jets...

34
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:22,342
<i>They have a cheeky side, too.</i>

35
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:25,879
People who shout out to us, HiHi Jets,

36
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:29,282
will get top priority for fan service!

37
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:30,884
-HiHi!
-HiHi!

38
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,719
-HiHi!
-HiHi!

39
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:39,859
{\an8}We're always raising our ambitions
higher and higher.

40
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:42,762
{\an8}If we set a limit,
we wouldn't grow beyond it.

41
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:44,697
So, we don't set limits.

42
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:46,733
-One big cheer.
-Is "Yeah!" okay?

43
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:49,736
<i>They always have a team talk before gigs.</i>

44
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:51,971
Let's do this!

45
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,941
-All right.
-Okay.

46
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,544
<i>Quite anticlimactic.</i>

47
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,915
That's how we do team talks.

48
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:04,350
We are HiHi Jets.

49
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:06,452
<i>And their dream is...</i>

50
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:10,190
To become a legendary group.

51
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,426
{\an8}I think the five of us can do it.

52
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:22,302
{\an8}<i>We first join them in June.</i>

53
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:25,505
-Okay, shall we put the skates on?
-Yes.

54
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:31,644
<i>Rehearsals have begun
for their summer shows.</i>

55
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:33,213
Let's do it.

56
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:40,119
<i>Their roller-skating routine
demands a good sense of balance.</i>

57
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:45,225
<i>The members are tremendously athletic.</i>

58
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,898
{\an8}<i>Soya Igari is the youngest.</i>

59
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:52,966
{\an8}SOYA IGARI (17)

60
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:55,335
{\an8}<i>He choreographs the skating routines.</i>

61
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:58,771
{\an8}Four is one-and-a-half beats.

62
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:03,176
<i>He was scouted by the agency
eight years ago</i>

63
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,911
<i>when they spotted his talent.</i>

64
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:11,451
<i>A lot is demanded of him.</i>

65
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,255
Hey, don't mess around. Stop.

66
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,458
That was all wrong. Don't goof around.

67
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:19,959
I didn't make it in time.

68
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:25,698
{\an8}<i>The oldest and the group's center,
Yuto Takahashi, isn't spared.</i>

69
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:26,933
{\an8}YUTO TAKAHASHI (20)

70
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:28,534
Oh, it's this way!

71
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:33,873
<i>Takahashi was the latest of the five
to join the agency.</i>

72
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,708
<i>He's also an inexperienced skater.</i>

73
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,944
-You okay?
-Are you all right?

74
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:42,048
{\an8}<i>He was devoted to baseball
through middle school.</i>

75
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:45,285
{\an8}<i>After graduating,
he dived into this world.</i>

76
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:47,353
{\an8}SIGNS WITH JOHNNY'S AT AGE 15

77
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:48,621
I was a catcher.

78
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:50,423
-Were you?
-Yes.

79
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,924
<i>Which raises the question...</i>

80
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:54,427
If HiHi was a baseball team,

81
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:57,263
-what positions would everyone play?
-What positions?

82
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,665
Who would be the pitcher?

83
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:00,667
Oh, let me think.

84
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:02,769
I'm curious to hear this.

85
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:06,806
Igari would be the pitcher.

86
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:08,741
{\an8}RYUTO SAKUMA (17)

87
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:12,445
{\an8}<i>What about Ryuto Sakuma,
who is the joint-youngest with Igari?</i>

88
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:15,315
Maybe the shortstop.

89
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,718
-He's extremely observant.
-Oh?

90
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:20,987
See? He noticed that.

91
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:23,556
He can play the piano, he can skate...

92
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,391
{\an8}RYO HASHIMOTO (19)     MIZUKI INOUE (19)

93
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,427
{\an8}<i>And what of Ryo Hashimoto
and Mizuki Inoue,</i>

94
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:30,063
{\an8}<i>who have been with the agency
for ten years?</i>

95
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,032
Hashimoto would be...

96
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:35,902
on third base.

97
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:38,137
He could even do third base fourth.

98
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,039
He's talking about me.

99
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,441
He's a big, solid guy.

100
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,309
Ryo Hashimoto's a proper man.

101
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:46,879
Second base would be Mizuki.

102
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:49,849
The second baseman is very important.

103
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,285
-Yeah, yeah.
-The man on second...

104
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,054
<i>Once he gets onto baseball,
he doesn't stop.</i>

105
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:58,091
You should see Kikuchi play.

106
00:05:58,157 --> 00:06:00,860
Hey! I said we were doing it!

107
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:03,162
-I want to be like Ichiro.
-Come on!

108
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:04,364
-Never mind.
-Sorry!

109
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,165
-I'll do it.
-I'm sorry!

110
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:08,267
We're getting nowhere like this.

111
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:11,971
<i>Their ages may differ,
but there's no seniority in the group.</i>

112
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,611
<i>Tidying up the roller skates today</i>

113
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:20,813
<i>is one of the eldest, Hashimoto.</i>

114
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:23,883
Thank you.

115
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,656
As long as you're not rude
to the person you're talking to,

116
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:35,027
you can talk to any other member
like you're on the same level.

117
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:37,330
Yeah. You don't want to be taken lightly.

118
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,766
We tell each other how we really feel.

119
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:45,138
<i>In charge of tying everyone together</i>

120
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:48,107
<i>is the group's center, Takahashi.</i>

121
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:49,275
All right!

122
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:57,183
{\an8}<i>Today, Takahashi is appearing
alongside members from rival groups</i>

123
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,352
{\an8}<i>on a TV variety show.</i>

124
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,491
<i>They have to remake a table</i>

125
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:08,361
<i>owned by a member of the public
into a foldable one.</i>

126
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:13,499
All right, let's get straight to it!

127
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:14,634
Let's do it!

128
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,403
This and the outside...

129
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:21,941
<i>As a professional instructs them,
they take the table apart and rebuild it.</i>

130
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:29,215
<i>After six hours of work, it's ready.</i>

131
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,219
A screw's sticking out.

132
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,521
-On the top.
-Oh, man...

133
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:40,526
<i>They've damaged the precious table.</i>

134
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,262
<i>There's a problem with the legs, too.</i>

135
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:49,502
At the very end,
this just isn't satisfactory.

136
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:51,270
It's jutting out.

137
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:55,441
We've done something inexcusable.

138
00:07:55,508 --> 00:08:00,546
I'm very sorry, but we're going
to have to give this back.

139
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:03,182
-Okay, and move.
-Take it that way.

140
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:04,283
Right.

141
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:13,659
<i>After the recording,
Takahashi goes to apologize</i>

142
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:15,695
<i>to the table's owner of his own volition.</i>

143
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:20,299
<i>Here's what he said when asked why.</i>

144
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:28,508
That's how my parents brought...
No, how they are bringing me up.

145
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:31,143
You can't forget to be grateful.

146
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:34,247
They've always told me that.

147
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:36,582
You see us guys on the screen,

148
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:38,618
but there are people other than us,

149
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,621
lots of people,
who are working with us from the morning.

150
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,323
And it's thanks to them
we're able to do this,

151
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,226
but I've been a nuisance
to all of those people.

152
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:50,596
Maybe not a nuisance,

153
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:53,366
but I feel like
I've made a problem for them,

154
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:55,401
and that feels horrible.

155
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:58,804
No matter what it's about.

156
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:02,842
<i>It's this attitude which is why
he is in the group's center.</i>

157
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:04,744
Thank you so much.

158
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,679
Thank you. See you again soon.

159
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:14,053
<i>The summer performances are drawing near.</i>

160
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:20,159
<i>They need to decide
which songs they'll perform.</i>

161
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:25,731
-Shall we make it flashy?
-We'd better not.

162
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:28,668
Maybe rock-type songs,
and we can wear suits?

163
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:29,635
Not suits.

164
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:31,203
Maybe something stylish, then.

165
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:34,307
Something scary. Like gang-style outfits.

166
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:36,409
Something you don't see from Johnny's.

167
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:40,313
You don't see that,
which is why we have to do it now.

168
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:43,349
We need to decide.

169
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:48,487
<i>Clashing their ideas against each other's</i>

170
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:49,956
<i>is their method.</i>

171
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,225
{\an8}HIHI JETS EX THEATER

172
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:56,762
{\an8}<i>This is the resulting finished set list.</i>

173
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:04,003
<i>The 90-minute show features an astounding
26 songs, including the encore.</i>

174
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,606
It's seriously long.

175
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:10,476
We feel like, "I just want
to show you this," about everything.

176
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:13,045
It'd be a shame to drop any of it.

177
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,981
-They're all highlights.
-Yeah.

178
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:16,849
I like all of them.

179
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,018
<i>They decide to do them all in the end.</i>

180
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:24,156
We all speak our minds,
so it's hard to reach a decision.

181
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:26,792
We want to all be equal.

182
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,595
Being with people
who have differing opinions

183
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:32,832
means you hear new,
interesting perspectives.

184
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,535
"Great idea," you think.

185
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:39,305
{\an8}JULY 24, 2019

186
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:41,874
{\an8}<i>It's the rehearsal
ten days before the show.</i>

187
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,444
<i>The five will be taking this on.</i>

188
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:49,081
<i>It's a 1,7-meter-tall roller-skating ramp.</i>

189
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:55,721
<i>They'll be speeding down it
towards the audience.</i>

190
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:01,761
I am a bit scared. It's huge.

191
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:04,330
Here goes.

192
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:06,032
<i>Igari goes first.</i>

193
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:11,604
<i>It's a breeze for him.</i>

194
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:14,206
-Go ahead.
-Okay.

195
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,275
<i>The same for the agile Sakuma.</i>

196
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:18,611
With room to spare!

197
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,613
-You didn't use the brakes?
-No.

198
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:25,885
<i>After Inoue and Hashimoto also succeed,</i>

199
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:27,687
<i>it's Takahashi's turn last.</i>

200
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,792
-Here I go!
-Okay!

201
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:37,763
Ouch...

202
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,366
It's because you're scared.
Take a breather.

203
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:44,003
<i>If he can't do it,</i>

204
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,839
<i>they'll have to consider a change of plan.</i>

205
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:49,942
The protective gear does nothing!

206
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:53,979
If you have your right foot on it,
step out with your left.

207
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:56,549
You don't want to move this.

208
00:11:57,516 --> 00:11:58,584
And balance on it.

209
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:02,755
Balance on that, and as your left foot
steps out, shift your weight forward.

210
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:07,793
<i>This is the only day that's been assigned
to ramp practice.</i>

211
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:15,067
<i>He removes his helmet to finally do it
like he will for the real thing.</i>

212
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,069
This is scary.

213
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,405
You all went as you turned, right?

214
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,874
<i>Just in case,</i>

215
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:24,577
<i>the crew block him from falling
off the stage.</i>

216
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:27,913
-I really might crash into you.
-Which way will you go?

217
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:28,881
-This way.
-Okay.

218
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:33,452
Look out!

219
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:39,358
You smashed right into them!

220
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:42,628
Oh no!

221
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,065
Every mat...

222
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:47,633
You touched every single mat!

223
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:51,937
<i>Even at times like this,
no kind words are offered.</i>

224
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:54,507
You should choose one way.

225
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:56,742
I think you can do it, though.

226
00:12:56,809 --> 00:13:00,613
Start turning where you want to go
from the offset.

227
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,082
Remember to turn from the start.

228
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:04,850
-Here goes.
-Okay.

229
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,120
-Here goes.
-Okay.

230
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:17,263
-All right! Perfect. All done.
-Mission cleared!

231
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:18,998
We can do "One Kiss" now.

232
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,333
Oh, boy.

233
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:24,103
I'm glad I managed to do it.

234
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:27,139
It's seriously tall, though.

235
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:30,843
<i>Takahashi went through
a trying period in his life.</i>

PHOTO COURTESY OF <i>WINK UP</i>

237
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:35,514
<i>When the group first formed,</i>

238
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:38,384
<i>despite having no dancing
or skating experience,</i>

239
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,686
<i>he was entrusted with being
the group's center.</i>

240
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,422
<i>Unable to keep up in rehearsals,</i>

241
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,525
<i>it once seemed like
the pressure was too much.</i>

242
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:52,832
{\an8}Being part of the group
meant I was suffering.

243
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:54,667
There was so much.

244
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:56,502
Thinking about it now...

245
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:01,640
I wasn't putting in nearly enough effort.

246
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,809
Thinking about it now,

247
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:08,781
I wonder how tough it really was.

248
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,150
It really wasn't that bad.

249
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:16,355
<i>This was Inoue's response
when asked about that time.</i>

250
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:21,360
He was hopeless,
so I really disliked him back then.

251
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:24,163
Wow, he really sucked.

252
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,265
But he can do it all now.

253
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:29,201
That's why I think he's brilliant.

254
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:32,004
He's not a kid who whines
that he can't do something.

255
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,273
Not a kid, a guy.

256
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,742
He's a guy who keeps going
until he can do it.

257
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:43,082
<i>It's this approach
that's taken Takahashi all this way.</i>

258
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:47,620
If I was to give it all up today...

259
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:52,825
Well, maybe it did happen once.

260
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:56,862
To decide I wasn't capable of improving...

261
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:01,467
was something I refused to do, though,

262
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,436
because something in the back of my head
stopped me.

263
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,840
I couldn't leave it behind.

264
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,578
-It could be information overload.
-Overload?

265
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:16,482
<i>The five have always clashed
with each other honestly.</i>

266
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:20,619
<i>And that's precisely why
their bonds are so solid.</i>

267
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:24,690
That's so true!

268
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,226
We know ourselves better than anyone.

269
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:28,894
We'd never do that.

270
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:31,997
{\an8}AUGUST 3-23, 2019

271
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:35,367
{\an8}<i>And then the stage curtain lifts.</i>

272
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,436
{\an8}<i>PAPA MAMA ICHIBAN
HADAKA NO SHONEN NATSU MATSURI!</i>

273
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,574
Can you make some noise?

274
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:43,676
Yeah!

275
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:07,232
{\an8}<i>They use the ramp for more than
just the opening,</i>

276
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,435
{\an8}<i>racing through tight gaps.</i>

277
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:16,608
{\an8}<i>To expand the group's repertoire
even further, Hashimoto plays guitar.</i>

278
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:27,119
<i>And Igari raps his own lyrics
to music he wrote.</i>

279
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:32,658
Thank you very much!

280
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:34,593
The end!

281
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:35,728
Done!

282
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:39,598
<i>Next, it's the biggest Johnny's Jr. show,</i>

283
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,300
<i>the Tokyo Dome Concert.</i>

284
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:44,903
<i>However, something is weighing
on their minds.</i>

285
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:49,441
{\an8}JULY 24, 2019

286
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:53,345
{\an8}<i>It's something that happened
a few days ago in rehearsals.</i>

287
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:55,781
Ouch!

288
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,449
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

289
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,686
-Thanks.
-Got it.

290
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:03,756
<i>After a thumb injury,</i>

291
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:07,493

<i>Around 300 Johnny's Jr. idols

295
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:24,176
<i>for the Tokyo Dome Concert.</i>

296
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:29,982
It's so... It's so big.

297
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:36,588
<i>The focal point f HiHi Jets is,
of course, roller-skating.</i>

298
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:45,931
<i>It's a great opportunity for them to show
what they've got to 55,000 people.</i>

299
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:51,870
<i>However, Igari's done it again.</i>

300
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,508
It hurts. Damn.

301
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:59,211
I've really messed it up. I can't turn it.

302
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:01,113
-It's my wrist.
-Your wrist?

303
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:02,414
The left one again.

304
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:08,454
<i>It's an injury that will affect
every aspect of the performance.</i>

305
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,189
-How did you do it?
-On the ramp.

306
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:17,062
<i>That's because Igari was assigned the task
of using his roller skates</i>

307
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:19,031
<i>to jump over nine people.</i>

308
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,438
<i>They won't let him risk further injury.</i>

309
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:32,044
<i>Brought in as a last-minute replacement</i>

310
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,979
<i>is the nimble Sakuma.</i>

311
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,747
I'll do my best.

<i>It's the group's greatest chance

313
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:44,089
<i>Failure isn't an option.</i>

314
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:46,058
Here I come!

315
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:50,662
Is he here?

316
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,970
<i>He gets it on the first attempt.</i>

317
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:02,374
<i>It's down to the strength they've fostered
by always making each other tougher.</i>

318
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:06,245
Whoa! Awesome!

319
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:09,481
Saku-chan really is an amazing guy.

320
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,253
He can do anything.

321
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,589
Seriously, I mean...

322
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:21,093
<i>With a relieved look on his face,</i>

323
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,395
<i>Igari recalls a bitter experience.</i>

324
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:29,902
<i>Two years ago,
because of an injury he had suffered,</i>

325
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:32,137
<i>none of the members could appear</i>

326
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:36,108
<i>on a TV music show they aspired to be on
and their opportunities were reduced.</i>

327
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:40,946
If I were in their shoes,

328
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,148
I'd have wanted me

329
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:46,552
to take responsibility.
It was a really big deal.

330
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:51,456
For Johnny's Jr. artists, <i>Music Station</i>
is a major platform. It's big.

331
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:54,826
You really want to get your foot
in that door,

332
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:59,431
so being booked to be on it
was an incredible chance.

333
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:01,266
Us losing that opportunity...

334
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:04,369
was something
I couldn't apologize enough for.

335
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,372
But it was because of that

336
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:11,643
that I changed my outlook on things.

337
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,213
I wanted to be more grateful
for my band mates.

338
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:16,682
I realized how lucky I was.

339
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:18,817
My sense of gratitude
for being able to do this

340
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,453
while surrounded by such great people
became stronger.

00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:30,462
Hello! We're HiHi Jets!

344
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:32,698
Tokyo Dome!

345
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:51,617
<i>And they reach the peak
of their performance.</i>

346
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,051
Here we go!

347
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:54,519
Go!

348
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,088
-Here he comes!
-All right!

349
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:57,389
Cheer him on!

350
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:00,192
Oh no!

351
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:06,465
Very cool!

352
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:09,334
<i>This group that hopes to achieve
legendary status</i>

353
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:12,504
<i>has taken one step closer to that dream.</i>

354
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:18,377
All done.

355
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:19,911
That was fun.

356
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:23,115
It was fun. All new stuff.

357
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:27,419
<i>However, after this
they will be met with a big setback.</i>

358
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:28,654
A lot happened.

359
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:33,792
<i>Next, on</i> Ride On Time<i>...</i>

360
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:38,597
{\an8}<i>HiHi Jets face a crisis.</i>

361
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:40,332
What scares me most

362
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:42,734
is that the two of them
might not come back.

363
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:45,604
{\an8}<i>Two members are hit by a scandal.</i>

364
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:48,240
{\an8}WITHDRAWAL FROM ACTIVITY

365
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,076
{\an8}<i>The five are suddenly separated.</i>

366
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:55,247
{\an8}<i>What will become of their dream
of being a legendary group?</i>

367
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:58,383
{\an8}I had to consider what I'd do

368
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:01,586
{\an8}if the group couldn't go on anymore.
In case it went south.

369
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:04,456
{\an8}A relationship of trust.

370
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:06,058
{\an8}If we can't have that,

371
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:08,960
{\an8}I don't think us five can stay together.

372
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:12,564
<i>Where will fate lead them?</i>

373
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:14,700
We can only do what we can right now.

374
