00:00:20,987 --> 00:00:21,955
{\an8}TOMOYUKI YARA (36)

2
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,090
{\an8}<i>One of Johnny's top dancers,</i>

3
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:27,227
{\an8}<i>is a performerwho has continued to
blaze his own trail...</i>

4
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:28,561
{\an8}<i>Tomoyuki Yara.</i>

5
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:38,605
{\an8}<i>The show which he produces,</i>
THE YOUNG LOVE DISCOTHEQUE<i>,</i>

6
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:43,610
{\an8}<i>recreates dances from across the eras
such as break and rock dancing.</i>

7
00:00:43,676 --> 00:00:46,179
{\an8}<i>It's a new kind of live entertainment.</i>

8
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:53,153
{\an8}<i>Dancers active across the world
also feature in this love letter to dance,</i>

9
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,954
{\an8}<i>delighting audiences.</i>

10
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:02,729
<i>The source of this
finely-tuned performance</i>

11
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:07,233
<i>is his inquisitive spirit, operating
at full steam despite being past 35.</i>

12
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,469
-How do you do it?
-Ready? Go!

13
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,506
This is hilarious!

14
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:16,943
<i>At the same time, however,</i>

15
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:20,080
<i>he faces the start of the show
with many injuries.</i>

16
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:25,051
<i>Having backed himself into a corner,
Yara has some secret feelings.</i>

17
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:28,288
I feel like the second...

18
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:33,560
No, not the second. I don't know if it's
the second, third or fourth.

19
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:38,164
But I feel like a period of change
in my life is coming.

20
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:42,669
I feel that very strongly
now that I'm at this age.

21
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,772
"This guy's part of Johnny's?"

22
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:50,176
I wanted people to think of me that way.

23
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:15,568
<i>This is documentary series</i> Ride On Time.

24
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,472
{\an8}Everyone, please.

25
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:21,908
{\an8}<i>Having grown up in Johnny's,</i>

26
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:25,278
{\an8}<i>Tomoyuki has come together
with a variety of people through dance.</i>

27
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,817
{\an8}<i>He's known Go Ueki for over a decade.</i>

28
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:36,890
{\an8}<i>He has a great respect for Ueki,who's won
break dancing prizes in world contests.</i>

29
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:42,061
{\an8}<i>This is BREAK FREE, who Ueki produces.</i>

30
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:45,565
{\an8}<i>They're made up entirely of people
who perform across the globe.</i>

31
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:48,101
<i>Apparently,</i>

32
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:51,571
<i>they, too, are keeping an eye out
for what's happening with Yara's show.</i>

33
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,908
As I said earlier,

34
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:58,311
this is the first time I've seen
people from Johnny's giving it their all.

35
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:00,947
It's rare.

36
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:04,651
-It's probably rude to say but...
-I think it's true.

37
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:06,686
Are you including everyone in that?

38
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:10,156
-Huh? You mean not just Johnny's?
-Right.

39
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:11,524
Yesterday,

40
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:14,527
when I saw their shoot,
I thought they were crazy!

41
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,630
-How many versions were you doing?
-About ten.

42
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,132
About ten patterns.

43
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,435
They kept shooting the same routine,

44
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:25,471
but from different angles.

45
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:28,808
When they won the award in Edinburgh,

46
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,444
I thought, "I knew it."

47
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:35,248
I was quite envious seeing that.

48
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:40,353
-It was something I couldn't have done.
-Right.

49
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,022
Performing overseas like that

50
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:46,426
is a dream of mine
I'd like to accomplish one day.

51
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:50,830
<i>At Yara's enthusiastic request,</i>

52
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:54,067
<i>BREAK FREE will be performing
in</i> DISCOTHEQUE.

53
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:59,539
I thought that my beatboxing solo

54
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:04,344
could be something original that Toyo-chan
and I could come up with.

55
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:09,716
<i>Yara is directing all of the performances,</i>

56
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:13,553
<i>but for this collaboration,
he'll be attempting their choreography.</i>

57
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:16,322
-I can do it. No sweat.
-I wasn't sure.

58
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:22,929
Then this bit is stuck here. Pop it out.

59
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,564
-Here?
-Yeah, your elbow.

60
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:28,401
-Then...
-Yeah.

61
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:29,469
Wave, like this.

62
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:32,105
Once it cuts over here, let it go.

63
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:33,539
-Let it go.
-Right.

64
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,074
Then push out.

65
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:38,378
Once it comes down, aim to be right here.

66
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:41,014
-Then hold this.
-Hold it.

67
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,016
-And in here.
-In here.

68
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:45,018
-And again.
-And again.

69
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:49,022
The point is to always stop here.

70
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:51,658
Like this, bang. Always stopping here.

71
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:53,192
And stop.

72
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:55,128
And stop.

73
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:57,697
Then stab your right hand in.

74
00:04:58,231 --> 00:04:59,198
Keep this here,

75
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:02,402
and put your right hand in.
Still keeping this here.

76
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:04,337
And go!

77
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,208
Stab it in!

78
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:11,110
That's it! Wave.

79
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:13,446
Looking good.

80
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:14,947
Okay, pantomime.

81
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:16,449
-Yes!
-Now?

82
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:18,351
That's it! Yeah!

83
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:21,888
Yeah!

84
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:24,757
-You've got it.
-That's tricky!

85
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,192
Very good.

86
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:37,170
-Like that.
-I think you should do that first.

87
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:39,772
-That sound―
-Or maybe last.

88
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,108
-That would work.
-Nice.

89
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:45,745
What's this?

90
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:47,947
-He looked unhappy.
-No.

91
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,116
-He was being shy.
-No, now!

92
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,418
-I wasn't.
-He doesn't normally do that.

93
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:56,489
-Let's do that. It's cool.
-You might be right.

94
00:05:56,556 --> 00:06:00,326
<i>They bring together
all the ideas everybody has</i>

95
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:03,996
<i>to create a complex routine
and structure as they go along.</i>

96
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:11,738
Then if I suddenly do a move like this
and go straight into it,

97
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:13,639
-it might be cooler.
-Yeah.

98
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,641
Which do you prefer? For example,

99
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:19,812
opening up like this, then "bang, bang."

100
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,286
Okay!

101
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,290
<i>The presence of a dance team,
who share Yara's goal,</i>

102
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:33,326
<i>can sometimes be a little dazzling.</i>

103
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,966
I like it! I like both of them.

104
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:42,668
-It's becoming a story.
-It is.

105
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,138
I think whichever we choose,
it will look cool.

106
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:49,175
I like the one we just did.
It feels more street.

107
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:51,244
That's true.

108
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,913
-I can see Brooklyn.
-Brooklyn.

109
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:55,982
Brooklyn? Definitely.

110
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:57,817
It has a sort of basketball vibe.

111
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:01,320
I was very envious of them.

112
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:03,589
Those performers.

113
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:08,895
Of their sort of team mentality.

114
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,664
Every one of them is a specialist.

115
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:14,734
They each bring something unique
to the table.

116
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:19,038
As I wonder if there are people here...

117
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,241
who have the same ambition as me,

118
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:24,444
I realize there aren't.

119
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:28,815
Because I'm a fanatic.

120
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:33,085
I can't expect my juniors
to get to that point.

121
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,691
It would actually be a pain if they did,
and I'd ask them to stop.

122
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:40,326
Yeah.

123
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,063
I do isolate myself in that way.

124
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:46,966
But, you know,

125
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:50,436
once I start heading somewhere,
I can't turn around.

126
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:52,405
No.

127
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,641
AUGUST 1999

128
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,009
<i>When they were Jr.s,</i>

129
00:07:57,243 --> 00:08:00,413
<i>Sho Sakurai went through
the same ups and downs as Yara.</i>

130
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:06,319
<i>Back then, the two of them spent many days
researching by watching dance videos.</i>

131
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:12,024
We weren't the guys
who would be right at the front.

132
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:13,392
SHO SAKURAI

133
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:17,330
We weren't in the position to be somewhere
where we would stand out.

134
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:23,236
Not like how Nino or Matsumoto or Aiba
in ARASHI are.

135
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:25,037
We weren't showy like that.

136
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,643
So, when it came to what we would do,
dance was the only way to show ourselves.

137
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:35,915
He was the person who was always
by my side through all of that.

138
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,451
So, you tried to show yourself off

139
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,286
through dance, too, Sakurai?

140
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,787
Yes, I did back then.

141
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:44,590
Maybe not now, though.

142
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:50,530
{\an8}<i>Later,</i>

143
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:53,366
{\an8}<i>in a unit called Musical Academy,</i>

144
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:56,435
{\an8}<i>Yara was blessed with band mates
who liked street dance.</i>

145
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,510
{\an8}<i>Choosing their own set lists and routines,</i>

146
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:06,479
{\an8}<i>they were an unusual unit for the time.</i>

147
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:36,609
<i>However, Musical Academy,</i>

148
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:39,345
<i>never managed to release a CD.</i>

149
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:47,219
<i>Why exactly did Yara choose a path
that nobody else does?</i>

150
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,993
<i>He's invited the cameras here
so he can explain.</i>

151
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:02,702
Look at that! I'd like to have a go
on a boat like that.

152
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:05,037
I can pilot those.

153
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,106
-Really?
-Boats like that.

154
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:10,576
It looks like it's come from abroad.

155
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:14,080
Since you've come all this way,

156
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:19,619
I thought I would talk about whatever,
regardless of if you can use it or not.

157
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:23,789
Otherwise there wouldn't be any point.

158
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:25,224
Yeah.

159
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,564
I had a big think once,
before I turned 20.

160
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:35,167
About whether I should carry on
the way I was.

161
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:37,503
I think everyone does that.

162
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:42,174
Well, maybe not if you debut
when you're still a teenager.

163
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:46,212
Well, I thought about it 15 or 20 times.

164
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,615
It was a multiple-time thing.

165
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:51,550
About if you should carry on?

166
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:54,453
It was basically like, "I want to quit!"

167
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:57,289
Yes, I wanted to quit.

168
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:01,193
It didn't mean anything.

169
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,796
But dance was something

170
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:06,198
that I absolutely did not question.

171
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:11,270
That was true when I was in my teens.

172
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,273
I liked this kind of dancing
and this kind of music.

173
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,877
So, in that sense,

174
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:22,748
I had a strong feeling of wanting
to be involved with that as an artist.

175
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,351
So,

176
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:29,622
something my seniors often said to me was,

177
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:36,962
"Do things like that
after you make your debut."

178
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:40,399
I was always told that.

179
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:44,770
But if I could do it, I wanted to do it.

180
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:52,078
What happens to a person if they can't do
the thing they want to?

181
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:56,282
I would just have to go for it by myself.

182
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,318
That's why.

183
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:03,923
So, did you have the option
of leaving Johnny's

184
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:06,625
and pursuing life as a dancer?

185
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,531
I don't know...

186
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:17,103
It's not that I haven't had the option,

187
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:21,340
but I don't think I've ever thought,
"I want to be a dancer."

188
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:24,877
Probably not.

189
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:28,114
I wanted to master dancing,

190
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:35,121
but it was always something that
I wanted to do as a performing artist.

191
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:39,125
"This guy's part of Johnny's?"

192
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:43,395
I wanted people to think of me that way.

193
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,165
That's what it is.

194
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:48,934
And I feel the same way now.

195
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:53,572
That's why... Well, that's the reason why
<i>DISCOTHEQUE</i> has been possible.

196
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:56,275
Yeah.

197
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:11,757
<i>At the end of this road
he's put his faith in,</i>

198
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:14,360
<i>what kind of view awaits him?</i>

199
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:23,435
{\an8}<i>The first day is here of</i>
THE YOUNG LOVE DISCOTHEQUE.

200
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:29,508
I'm full already.

201
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:30,843
That's all I can manage.

202
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,681
This is why I lose weight.

203
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:39,351
I can hardly eat a thing.

204
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:41,987
It's not because I'm nervous.

205
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:46,525
Johnny's can't be taken lightly.
Not at all.

206
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:50,663
People will think, "It's just Johnny's
at the end of the day, right?"

207
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:51,831
That can't be helped.

208
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:55,401
But if I can show them
that there are people like us

209
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:57,636
in Johnny's, too,

210
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,939
I'll be happy.

211
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:04,376
<i>Sitting in the audience</i>

212
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:07,446
<i>will be dance-lovers who know their stuff.</i>

213
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,817
<i>Even if it's only one person,
he wants to absorb people into the dances.</i>

214
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,495
-We're starting in 15 minutes!
-All right!

215
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:29,435
<i>Yara has come up with an idea
for before the show starts.</i>

216
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:33,038
<i>A disco time for just the audience.</i>

217
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:38,177
<i>Open to anyone who wants to take part,</i>

218
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:41,247
<i>he doesn't know how many people
will come up to dance.</i>

219
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,349
Will I be on TV?

220
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:46,886
{\an8}Thank you very much! If everyone
makes their way to the circle...

221
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:49,788
{\an8}Wow! So many of you have come down!

222
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,057
-Thank you very much!
-Whoa!

223
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:53,359
Amazing!

224
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:55,861
Please spread out in the circle
as much as you can.

225
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,331
Great!

226
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,040
Very nice!

227
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:14,613
<i>The audience build up
the excitement for the show.</i>

228
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,283
Okay! Spin, spin! Side, side!

229
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:18,817
Very good! To the left!

230
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:20,486
Fever!

231
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,889
I like it!

232
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:28,727
I wasn't sure what to do...

233
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:32,932
<i>Now all that's left
is for Yara to enjoy it himself.</i>

234
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:38,404
I spent a lot of time thinking this over,
so thank you all very much.

235
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,145
-Okay.
-I'm counting on you.

236
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:47,947
-Huh?
-I'm counting on you.

237
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,915
Now, let's get started!

238
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:52,785
-Welcome to <i>DISCOTHEQUE 2019</i>!
-Here I go!

239
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:54,053
Take it away!

240
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,990
This <i>DISCOTHEQUE</i> is neither
a stage show nor a concert.

241
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:00,659
It's a new form of entertainment.

242
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:02,394
Allow me to introduce

243
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,296
Tomoyuki Yara!

244
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:01,814
{\an8}<i>The energy in the room is surging.</i>

245
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:05,951
{\an8}<i>But backstage, one member seems uneasy.</i>

246
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,491
{\an8}<i>It's the youngest Johnny's Jr.
in the show,</i>

247
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,426
{\an8}<i>Yukihiro Suetake.</i>

248
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,764
<i>Yara has asked Suetake</i>

249
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:22,668
<i>to find a new version of himself
and show it through dance.</i>

250
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:26,839
Look for what you find cool.

251
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:28,207
Like this...

252
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,976
I just want you to enjoy yourselves.

253
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:34,580
It feels like you're being made
to do it at the moment.

254
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:37,382
Didn't I say I wanted to see

255
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,651
how Yukihiro Suetake looked
as a lone artist?

256
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,921
I don't get it. I just don't.

257
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:45,591
-Not even after watching the video.
-No?

258
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:50,762
<i>And now the time
for Suetake's challenge is here.</i>

259
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:57,169
{\an8}<i>Yara came up with this dance battle scene.</i>

260
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:59,671
{\an8}<i>Naturally, there's no set choreography.</i>

261
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:01,940
<i>He can only lay himself bare and dance.</i>

262
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:21,093
<i>The professional overwhelms Suetake
with his dancing.</i>

263
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:34,907
<i>For Suetake, this performance</i>

264
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:37,576
<i>was the limit of his current ability.</i>

265
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:43,182
<i>Yara's opponent is Go Ueki.</i>

266
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:46,318
<i>It's a battle of mutual respect.</i>

267
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:25,157
{\an8}<i>The days spent searching for solutions...
The future expectations and anxieties...</i>

268
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,460
<i>The passion of the arena
they feel in this moment...</i>

269
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:32,564
<i>All are expressed through their bodies.</i>

270
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:39,238
<i>Yara is precisely where he aimed to be
in this performance.</i>

271
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:52,818
You have to do what can only be done
in that very moment.

272
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:57,589
I'll keep doing this kind of thing,

273
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:59,758
and eventually ten years will go by.

274
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,763
So, rather than just doing that,

275
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,966
if I throw out all the distractions

276
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:11,536
and just pursue this one thing
in particular,

277
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:14,539
I wonder what will happen to me.

278
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:17,209
I'll lose some things,

279
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:20,112
but what I gain because of it
could be great.

280
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:24,549
And if it doesn't work out,
I won't regret a thing.

281
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,018
That's also...

282
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:28,787
how I feel.

283
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:33,125
{\an8}<i>Next time,</i>

284
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:35,661
{\an8}<i>Travis Japan,
who aim for new heights in dance,</i>

285
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:38,530
{\an8}<i>are shown a new world by Tomoyuki Yara.</i>

286
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:40,332
{\an8}That's amazing!

287
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:44,603
{\an8}That's amazing!
I feel like my knee will slip.

288
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:50,542
{\an8}Watching Yara makes me feel bad
about myself.

289
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,978
{\an8}He looks so good.

290
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:57,015
{\an8}I can't dance how I want to anymore.

291
00:21:58,717 --> 00:21:59,985
{\an8}Just writhe around.

292
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:01,153
{\an8}Yeah.

293
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:08,727
{\an8}<i>They approach the apex
of Johnny's dancing.</i>

294
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:14,700
If I put the work in now,
maybe the future me will thank me.

295
