1
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:07,040
{\an8}-Let's do this.
-Okay.

2
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:10,110
Ready, go!

3
00:00:15,715 --> 00:00:16,750
-Awesome!
-Well?

4
00:00:16,816 --> 00:00:19,953
{\an8}<i>A performer in his 25th year
at Johnny's...</i>

5
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:21,988
{\an8}<i>Tomoyuki Yara.</i>

6
00:00:26,726 --> 00:00:28,161
<i>Right now,</i>

7
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:31,698
<i>he is taking onthe kind of entertainment
that he has dedicated his life to.</i>

8
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:33,666
All right!

9
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:37,137
-Yeah!
-That went well!

10
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:39,806
I'm so nervous.

11
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,948
{\an8}<i>Its name?</i> THE YOUNG LOVE DISCOTHEQUE.

12
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:55,855
<i>Starting with the 1970s disco scene,</i>

13
00:00:55,922 --> 00:00:59,192
<i>the music and dances from a variety
of periods are recreated,</i>

14
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:01,594
<i>inviting the audience into another world.</i>

15
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:12,272
<i>It's a time and space for everyone
to lose themselves in dance.</i>

16
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:16,409
<i>All of this is being upheld
by Yara's stoicism.</i>

17
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:21,381
I doubt I'll ever be satisfied
with my dancing.

18
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:25,585
As long as I'm doing this job,
I never will be.

19
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:28,421
That's why I crave to do things like this.

20
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:32,725
{\an8}ORIGINAL MUSICAL
<i>THE CIRCUS! EPISODE FINAL</i>

21
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:34,160
{\an8}<i>Yara's starred as an actor</i>

22
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:36,062
{\an8}<i>in over ten stage productions.</i>

23
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:46,940
{\an8}<i>He's also appeared in a show
notoriously hard to get tickets for,</i>

24
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,708
{\an8}Endless SHOCK.

25
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:53,179
<i>He's played the role of the rival,
Koichi Domoto, for many years.</i>

26
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:04,824
{\an8}<i>When it comes to choreography, as well,
he's worked on songs for countless groups</i>

27
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:08,528
{\an8}<i>and is trusted completely
by his Johnny's comrades.</i>

28
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:19,439
He's really skilled, really cool,
and has great taste, I think.

29
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:21,641
Someone who specializes in dance?

30
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:25,478
I'm sure there's nobody else like him.

31
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:27,981
<i>In the agency,</i>

32
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:31,151
<i>the number of people who look up to him
is considerable.</i>

33
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,356
{\an8}If you can choose who you're going
to work with,

34
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:39,159
{\an8}it's always, "Yara!"

35
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:41,127
{\an8}YUMA NAKAYAMA

36
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:45,298
He's detailed, works you hard,
and makes no compromises.

37
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:50,203
He spends the time necessary
to make something good,

38
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,906
and I admire him for that drive.

39
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:58,845
<i>Surprisingly, however,</i>

40
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:01,147
<i>Yara has long been torn</i>

41
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:05,985
<i>between forging his own path
and living the life of an idol.</i>

42
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,222
You get impatient.

43
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:12,525
I mean, at my age,
there's no chance, right?

44
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:15,562
Don't you think?

45
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:19,532
I'm signed with Johnny's,

46
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,702
I'm an idol...

47
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:26,472
And I'm still doing that at the age of 36.

48
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:31,711
It still makes me go, "Huh?"

49
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:38,418
<i>Despite having his doubts,
he continues to believe.</i>

50
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:44,490
<i>His goal</i>

51
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:49,395
<i>is a new realm of expression
using dance as its weapon.</i>

52
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:15,455
<i>This is documentary series</i> Ride On Time.

53
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:19,125
{\an8}CAST AND CREW MEETING

54
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:23,730
{\an8}<i>This will be</i> THE YOUNG LOVE DISCOTHEQUE<i>'s
third show since it first premiered.</i>

55
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:26,966
{\an8}<i>The members and crew have gathered today.</i>

56
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:34,507
I want to make it more stylish.

57
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:38,344
So, we need to think about
the sense of speed.

58
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:41,781
My goal this time

59
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:44,584
is an aggressive <i>DISCOTHEQUE</i>.

60
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,053
{\an8}KEITA RICHAED KUSAMA

61
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,590
{\an8}<i>As the show's general producer,
Yara has assembled members</i>

62
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:53,960
{\an8}<i>from among his trusted
junior Johnny's members.</i>

63
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,595
{\an8}BUNICHI HAMANAKA

64
00:04:57,196 --> 00:05:00,767
{\an8}<i>He's also recruited backup dancers
for famous singers,</i>

65
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:03,269
{\an8}<i>and professional dancers
who've worked as choreographers.</i>

66
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:09,876
{\an8}ITSUKA

67
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:12,779
{\an8}<i>And putting the music together
for the live show</i>

68
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:16,983
{\an8}<i>are rappers and DJs who've made
an impact on the Japanese scene.</i>

69
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:21,220
{\an8}<i>Assistant director MAEDA</i>

70
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:24,590
{\an8}<i>is one of the performers in whom
Yara has placed most of his trust.</i>

71
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:30,763
{\an8}<i>Meanwhile, someone who is perhaps
appearing to not be so reliable</i>

72
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:35,234
{\an8}<i>is Yukihiro Suetake,
only in his fourth year as a Johnny's Jr.</i>

73
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:39,906
{\an8}Then you stand your left leg up
and put this on it.

74
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,375
Then wrap it around your ankle.

75
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:46,612
Then one, two.

76
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:49,315
Then tense your stomach

77
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:54,520
and swing your left leg back.

78
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:56,723
That creates this motion.

79
00:05:57,156 --> 00:06:00,026
As that happens,
make your belly touch the floor.

80
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:02,495
Yes!

81
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:03,930
Spin your legs around.

82
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:07,333
As you did that,

83
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,268
your left leg didn't swing.

84
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:13,206
You stop halfway which makes you
have to use your strength to spin.

85
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:19,178
Swing! Then your legs move on their own.

86
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:21,881
Swing! That's it.

87
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,551
Show me your cartwheel.

88
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,690
You're joking!

89
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:32,959
Seriously?

90
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:38,030
<i>Suetake doesn't even have experience
as a backup dancer yet.</i>

91
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:42,402
I've only done basic dancing.

92
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:44,904
Just doing this the whole time.

93
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:48,374
-That can't be true!
-Really.

94
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,543
I don't do these crazy moves.

95
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:54,380
So, it's a bit new for me.

96
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:56,516
I mean, everything's new for me.

97
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:02,955
<i>Nevertheless, Yara has a reason
to bring in the young juniors especially.</i>

98
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,229
I'm asking you to do a variety of things,
Suetake.

99
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:13,766
The 1980s dances and the break dancing.

100
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:15,668
The 1970s,

101
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:20,473
like the soul dancing and so on.

102
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,577
You can see all kinds of videos
of them now, like on YouTube.

103
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:27,647
I want you to watch them
and get a feel for the atmosphere.

104
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:28,881
Yes.

105
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:32,685
What I most want is
for you to be conscious

106
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,254
of standing at the front of the stage

107
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:37,957
as a lone artist.

108
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:39,592
-That's the big thing.
-Yes.

109
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:44,096
That's more important than the technique.

110
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:50,236
<i>In addition to directing
and choreographing,</i>

111
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,238
<i>Yara also has work to do as a performer.</i>

112
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,509
I've received a video of a routine.

113
00:07:56,909 --> 00:08:00,346
So, I'll have to practice it
until it sinks in.

114
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,550
I'm watching a video by myself
to memorize it.

115
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:06,085
-It's dull work.
-No, it's amazing.

116
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,792
-Can you tell what's going on?
-Not really.

117
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:14,994
This is so difficult.

118
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:18,598
This job really is fun, though.

119
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:21,901
So, you know...

120
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:28,307
<i>It's a collaboration
with a top dance team.</i>

121
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:40,319
One, two. Oh, damn!

122
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:42,522
It's fast.

123
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:50,563
I can't decipher it.

124
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:06,178
-Hello.
-Hello.

125
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,149
-I should have it down.
-Really?

126
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:11,684
Amazing!

127
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:14,487
I only had the film,
so I don't have the little details.

128
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,454
Sure.

129
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:22,228
{\an8}<i>This is the dance team, 9stepper'z!!</i>

130
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,463
{\an8}<i>Yara will be dancing a routine</i>

131
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:28,167
{\an8}<i>that saw them place
in Japan's biggest contest.</i>

132
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,569
Way to go!

133
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:04,837
Brilliant!

134
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:06,305
You're kidding me.

135
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:07,340
Awesome!

136
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:10,009
-We could never do that!
-That was great.

137
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:13,546
It's amazing how fast he learns.

138
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,215
How long did it take?
When did we send it to him?

139
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,517
-Last week?
-It was last week.

140
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:22,455
-Not even two weeks ago?
-Thursday two weeks ago, maybe.

141
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:27,927
But it was more or less perfect
when we got here today.

142
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,796
We just had to do the little touches.

143
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:33,666
It's amazing, learning from a video.

144
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:37,136
We had to do the formation, too.
That was it.

145
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:38,638
He's the real deal.

146
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,607
He's a Johnny's idol.

147
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:44,176
So, how do top dancers like you feel

148
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:48,014
about taking part
in an event like this?

149
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,183
How do we feel?

150
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,353
We're absolutely thrilled.

151
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:57,123
I was struck by going
to the Johnny's offices.

152
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:00,359
"This is Johnny's agency!" I thought.

153
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:05,464
<i>Yara's attention went to street dance</i>

154
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:08,367
<i>due to one person's music.</i>

155
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:09,468
Good morning.

156
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:13,472
-Here we are.
-Wow!

157
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,308
This is how much music he listens to.

158
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,543
-Incredible.
-Yeah.

159
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,011
This is amazing.

160
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,214
I like this.

161
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:26,218
{\an8}<i>This is m.c.A.T, who'll be
working on the</i> DISCOTHEQUE <i>music.</i>

162
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:30,489
{\an8}<i>As they are going to be making
original dance music for each era,</i>

163
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:32,925
{\an8}<i>he is the only man for the job.</i>

164
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:37,129
In terms of my career,

165
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:40,700
I never thought
I'd get to team up with Yara

166
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:43,235
in any of my lines of work.

167
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:46,539
I was very keen and interested at first,

168
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:48,908
but I wasn't sure it was going to work.

169
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:51,110
But then,

170
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,679
Yara eased my concerns by saying

171
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:58,651
we could work in all sorts of places,
and that he wanted to work with me.

172
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:02,555
And then it got going.
That made a big impression.

173
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:06,959
The thing is, with <i>DISCOTHEQUE</i>...

174
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,497
Well, I've always liked street dance

175
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,033
since I was a teenager.

176
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,269
And if it wasn't for street dance,

177
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:21,107
I'm not sure I would have been able
to make what I've made.

178
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:24,610
And ever since I was around 20,

179
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,714
I've had this idea
of somehow doing something with it.

180
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:33,686
Have you been this into dancing
all through your time at Johnny's?

181
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:37,456
Well, you know...

182
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:40,159
I just did the routines I was given

183
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:42,228
and tried to look my best, I guess.

184
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:46,499
I wasn't seeking out new techniques
or anything.

185
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:49,401
If anything,
I was more concerned about my hair.

186
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:52,171
I had a phase like that.

187
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:55,307
I would try to make my hair
look the best I could.

188
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:59,378
But since I came across A.T's music,

189
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:04,116
I've been more interested
in furthering my dance technique.

190
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:06,118
That sent me this way.

191
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,921
But...

192
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:11,524
I lived a tiresome life

193
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,426
at Johnny's for a while, actually.

194
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:19,999
{\an8}<i>At the age of 12,
Yara walked through Johnny's doors.</i>

195
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:23,736
{\an8}<i>Among his contemporaries
were Hideaki Takizawa</i>

196
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,172
{\an8}<i>and people who would go on
to be in ARASHI.</i>

197
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:32,411
{\an8}<i>When they were Jr.s, he and Sho Sakurai
were in similar positions.</i>

198
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:37,183
Rock dancing was the main focus
of Johnny's back then.

199
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:41,821
He said he wanted to do something

200
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:45,991
a little different, like hip-hop or house.

201
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:50,529
I remember the two of us
often watching VHS tapes together.

202
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:55,634
<i>Becoming obsessed with dance,</i>

203
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:59,238
<i>Yara strayed from the idol route.</i>

204
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,075
But that hasn't faded at all to this day.

205
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:05,711
And it's likely because it hasn't faded

206
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:08,214
that I was able to make this show.

207
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:11,016
It's been a long road.

208
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:14,887
I've thought about giving up
dozens of times.

209
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:16,622
Yeah.

210
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:19,758
{\an8}<i>THE CIRCUS!</i> PHOTOSHOOT

211
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:22,161
{\an8}<i>Most of the work he's offered now</i>

212
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:23,262
{\an8}<i>is for musicals.</i>

213
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:27,533
<i>He's already been cast in the lead roles
for two shows this year.</i>

214
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,969
That's it! Okay!

215
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:35,774
<i>To expand his range, he's also
applied himself to singing and acting.</i>

216
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:39,712
Yeah! Okay! Yeah!

217
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:42,748
It has some sexiness to it.

218
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:44,250
It's a good one, isn't it?

219
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,354
{\an8}<i>Involved in this show's production</i>

220
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,824
{\an8}<i>is a dance teacher who's seen Yara grow.</i>

221
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:54,226
He's a rare kind of person.

222
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:57,429
Someone who likes dance but is an idol.

223
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:59,098
You don't ever see that.

224
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:00,633
You do.

225
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:02,401
I haven't introduced you yet.

226
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:05,938
Jeez, this guy...
I was saying all nice things about you.

227
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:07,072
Really?

228
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,742
Just when you think he's gone,
he always turns up.

229
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:13,646
He really likes dancing.

230
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:16,482
I got really into TETSUHARU's dances.

231
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:20,119
They're so cool,
but I couldn't come every time.

232
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:21,820
His manager would bring him to one,

233
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:23,989
but then he'd miss the next one.

234
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:28,294
I guess that's how it is with idols,
but he came of his own volition, too.

235
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:35,167
<i>After much hard work, he got</i> DISCOTHEQUE.

236
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:39,371
<i>They've reached the climax of the show
in their practice sessions.</i>

237
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:45,311
It's an open, exposed show.

238
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:49,515
I said we could do
whatever we wanted here, didn't I?

239
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:58,524
<i>Their practice has gotten
to the show's climax.</i>

240
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,330
I messed up!

241
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:07,666
Is it easier to spin that way?

242
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:08,801
One more time.

243
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:13,973
<i>He wants to convey to his juniors
that if you like dance,</i>

244
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:17,710
<i>anyone can perform like the star
of the show in this kind of entertainment.</i>

245
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:19,979
Again. Good morning!

246
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:21,280
-Sorry.
-Good morning.

247
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:24,550
Sorry.

248
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:30,255
<i>That's why the greater the gap
between their technique and a pro's,</i>

249
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:34,927
<i>the more he wants them to consider
how to express themselves through dance.</i>

250
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:38,497
Put more "oomph" into your kick there.

251
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:39,965
Yes.

252
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:45,604
<i>He'd hoped to have gotten this
through to them many times,</i>

253
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:49,108
<i>but he still doesn't see it
in their attitude.</i>

254
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:56,815
<i>Hoping to create an opportunity for this,
he's making everyone undress.</i>

255
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:01,653
It's about exposure.

256
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:05,524
All right! Let's go!

257
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,059
I'll count you in.

258
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:24,610
Look for what you find cool.

259
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:26,111
Like this.

260
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:28,480
-Everyone does this differently.
-Yeah.

261
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,883
It's fine if some of you
are just doing that,

262
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:33,752
but if that's all you ever do,
it's not interesting.

263
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,521
It's a bit stiff.

264
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,761
{\an8}NEW JACK SWING:
POPULAR LATE '80s, EARLY '90s

265
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:45,964
{\an8}<i>For the new jack swing dance
they're currently mastering,</i>

266
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:49,034
{\an8}<i>it's not so much the precision
of the routine that's key,</i>

267
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:51,670
{\an8}<i>but the groove that each dancer has.</i>

268
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:06,385
Okay. Thank you very much.

269
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:08,854
Can I record you one time?

270
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:12,357
-That was awful.
-Okay, sorry!

271
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,759
Absolutely awful.

272
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:17,896
<i>They're not getting anywhere.</i>

273
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:21,166
<i>Yara is fretting.</i>

274
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:22,334
Have you been ill?

275
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:23,435
Ill?

276
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:24,603
I'm fine.

277
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:30,709
<i>How can he explain it to his juniors?</i>

278
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:35,881
I wonder what we should do.

279
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:38,083
Are you aware of what you're doing?

280
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:43,589
Are you doing what you've been asked
and giving it your best shot?

281
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,925
Listen, everyone.

282
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,129
You don't need to be in perfect time
with each other.

283
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,098
Do you want to come out as a group,
like, "Boom!"?

284
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:59,838
With this level of excitement,
you're not living up to the song.

285
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:03,675
You could do with some research.

286
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:07,412
Watch how they danced in the '90s
to new jack swing.

287
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:12,484
Then I think this routine
will come together.

288
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:15,821
Your grooves need to be together.

289
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:20,659
It's not about the exact moves,
but having the same rhythm.

290
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:23,295
You need to do your own research.

291
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:26,565
I doubt you're looking into

292
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:30,235
how you can make yourselves
look good with this.

293
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,104
Watch.

294
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:34,139
Nothing's changing like this.

295
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:36,808
Not from what you've been doing.

296
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:41,780
So, I want you to show me that.

297
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,985
<i>Every time a new dance is taken on,</i>

298
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:50,989
<i>days are spent searching for footage
to the point of exhaustion.</i>

299
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:57,729
<i>That's what made Yara what he is.</i>

300
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:07,472
Mae-chan made this routine for this music,

301
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:11,710
so, I just want you to enjoy the dancing.

302
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:14,947
Didn't I say I wanted to see

303
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:17,282
how Yukihiro Suetake looked
as a lone artist?

304
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:19,585
The same goes for Richard and Bun-chan.

305
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:21,353
You don't have to match,

306
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:25,157
but you need to come together
to make this <i>DISCOTHEQUE</i>.

307
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:26,491
That's what I want.

308
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,294
It's you guys who have to bring
that something extra.

309
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:32,564
I really want you
to have a think about that.

310
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:39,638
I don't get it. I just don't.

311
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:42,407
-Not even after watching the video.
-No?

312
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:44,443
I'll just have to do it.

313
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,578
Because watching hasn't helped me.

314
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:50,382
Because I don't know how to dance to it,

315
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:53,252
it's more confusing than it is fun
at the moment.

316
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,154
I don't have the rhythm down.

317
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:00,959
So, this isn't good enough
to go on stage yet?

318
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:04,363
Not for me, no. Definitely not.

319
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,698
-Definitely not?
-Definitely not.

320
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,433
They should...

321
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:11,570
be having fun themselves.

322
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:15,907
But they're not convincing me
that they are.

323
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:19,411
That's all it is.

324
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:21,947
They have to work the rest out
for themselves.

325
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:23,582
-Really?
-Yeah.

326
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:29,821
Once they do,
it should make a world of difference.

327
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:37,396
<i>Will Yara's feelings...</i>

328
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,198
<i>get through to them?</i>

329
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,207
{\an8}<i>The day of the first show
finally comes around.</i>

330
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:51,043
{\an8}There's no time to change.

331
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,812
{\an8}Just come on like that!

332
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:55,947
{\an8}Do your best in the battle.

333
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:57,949
{\an8}Keep battling a little more.

334
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:02,020
{\an8}So long as you have an attitude of attack,
it's sure to be thrilling.

335
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:05,524
{\an8}Johnny's can't be taken lightly.
Not at all.

336
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:12,564

he's devoted his life to begins.</i>
