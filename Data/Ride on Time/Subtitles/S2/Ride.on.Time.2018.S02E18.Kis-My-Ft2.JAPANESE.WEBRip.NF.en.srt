people can see Kisumai
from anywhere in the world.

7
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:34,067
I want people outside of Japan
to know about us.

8
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:39,406
I would love to travel

63
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:57,797
That's how Mom died.

64
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:59,799

00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,293
-It is?
-Yeah.

74
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:29,996
You're apologetic to your brother.

75
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:32,432
When Hisashi says, "I'm doing it for you."

76
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,802
I'd answer back,
"What do you expect? I'm blind!"

77
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:37,303
-Yeah?
-That's how I acted him.

78
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,807
-Your Toshiyuki is gentle.
-I guess.

79
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:43,509
My Toshiyuki is mean.

80
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,880
-It reflects our personalities.
-Totally.

81

85

{\an8}is there anything you want
to go over or discuss?

91
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:35,528
I have one fundamental problem.

His character development
is different from mine.

93
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:45,338
I wanted to check with you
whether you want me

94
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,407
to make my version closer to his.

95
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,776
There's no need to make them the same.

96
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:51,611
We're supposed to have two versions.

97
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:55,648
You haven't misinterpreted anything.

98
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:58,351

99
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,685

00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:03,156

We had a chance to meet

104
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:23,276
not necessarily blind,
but visually impaired people.

105
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:28,548

-Hello.

136
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,367
Did you practice hard?

137
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:30,736
Yes!

Yes!

<i>The children have been

<i>Kento has been practicing, too.</i>

143
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,261
Was that tempo okay?

144
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,497
We went too fast at the start.

<i>The other members arrive.</i>

146
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:15,014
Now we will perform "Awatenbo no..."

147
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:17,049
Sorry. Can you all stand?

148
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,720
"Awatenbo no Senga." Hasty Senga.

149
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,623
More hasty than the Santa in the song.

150
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:27,159
-Hasty Senga.
-A hasty Senga Claus.

151
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:29,528
I appreciate the jokes, guys.

152
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:31,197

154
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,133
-Yes!
-Good.

155
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:39,639
Now, we'll perform
"Awatenbo no Santa Claus."

156
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:36,128
Our theme this year is,
"Making people smile."

157
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,401
I hope...

158
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:47,306
I hope we can build a society

159
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:53,446
where the visually impaired
can live in safety.

160
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:57,650
Thank you so much for your support.

161
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:05,858
Perhaps it difficult for those who can see

162
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:09,395
to truly understand what it's like
to be visually impaired.

163
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:12,665
But being a part of Musicthon
changed my mind.

164
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,768
We need to understand.

165
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:18,604
Why aren't we even trying?

166
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:23,542
That's what brought me to tears
during the ending speech.

167
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:27,379
How long has it been?

168
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:29,381

{\an8}<i>Miyata seems to be flustered.</i>

173
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:46,198
{\an8}What could be the matter?

174
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:55,407
My lines have changed
20 minutes before I go on stage.

175
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:58,544
I can't forget this.

176
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:01,280
Just two lines.

177
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:04,717
I'm so flustered.
That's when I screw up the most.

178
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:09,255
<i>He tells Takashi about the changes.</i>

179
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,458
-Okay. That's it?
-Yep.

180
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:14,827
-Got it.
-Let's go.

181
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:20,933
How will he portray a blind man?

DRESSING ROOM D
WATARU YOKOO, TOSHIYA MIYATA

183
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:33,712
I just do this as a hobby.

184
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:36,182
<i>Five minutes until the curtain rises.</i>

185
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,422
I'm ready. Let's do this!

186
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,024
<i>It's time.</i>

187
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:49,128
<i>Miyata and Nikaido take the stage.</i>

188
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:59,538
I'm exhausted. Are you always this busy?

189
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:14,386
{\an8}Guess what?

190
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:17,389
{\an8}Yesterday, they asked me
if I wanted to work full-time.

191
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:18,858
{\an8}-They did?
-Yeah.

192
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:20,459
{\an8}Good for you!

193
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,829
{\an8}Don't get excited.
Nothing's been decided on yet.

194
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:28,400
Oh, about that model you were looking for.

195
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:29,368
Yeah?

196
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:30,569
I received an e-mail.

197
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:31,837
You did?

198
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:33,839
Shall I arrange for us to meet her?

199
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:44,383
There are things I can feel and do for you

200
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:48,621
{\an8}because I am blind.

201
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,492
<i>The play is 130 minutes long.</i>

202
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:58,163
<i>Miyata portrays the conflict
of a blind man.</i>

203
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:08,674
You two will make a great couple.

204
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:12,444
Really? Do you really think so?

205
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:14,813
Yeah, I do.

206
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,484
<i>Nikaido is there as his younger brother</i>

207
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,986
<i>who encourages him
with honest, caring words.</i>

208
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:22,688
They're closed.

209
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,624
I know. I'll go somewhere else.

210
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:27,526
-Be careful.
-I will.

211
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:35,634
<i>I was worried
about using only sound to act.</i>

212
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:38,938
However, I have been listening
to Nikaido's voice for years now.

213
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:41,340
I knew I could count on him.

214
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:45,110
After acting by just relying on sound,
I was reminded

215
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:48,547
that Nikaido's voice is
a pleasure to listen to.

216
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:54,320
{\an8}<i>Today is the first day
for Yokoo and Senga.</i>

218
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:57,823
Yokoo is so nervous.

219
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,959
Are you sure? Let me check.

220
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:01,927
Your hands are so cold!

221
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:07,533
-One, two!
-Matsuro!

222
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:10,569
Let's go!

223
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:14,006
{\an8}<i>Senga has been struggling
with building his character.</i>

224
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:17,376
{\an8}<i>How will he deliver the line today?</i>

225
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:25,351
{\an8}Guess what? Yesterday, they asked me
if I wanted to work full-time.

226
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:26,618
{\an8}-They did?
-Yeah.

227
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:28,287
{\an8}Good for you.

228
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,757
Don't get excited.
Nothing's been decided on yet.

229
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:34,994
-Yes!
-Aira, can you say something for me?

230
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:36,996
I need to know where you are.

231
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:38,831
Okay, then.

232
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:40,065
Here I am!

233
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:48,173
-You need to relax a bit more.
-Eh?

234
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,610
I'm a better photographer than you!

235
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:54,980
-No way!
-I am!

236
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,250
Screw you!

237
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:01,754
Seriously?

238
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,423
<i>It's time for that line.</i>

239
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:12,464
He's had it rough, living alone
with his brother since he turned 17.

240
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:16,602
A person like me
doesn't deserve happiness.

241
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:19,772
-Don't be stupid.
-Come on!

242
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:24,410
I don't deserve to be happy, ever.

243
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:28,981
What's gotten into you?

244
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,316
Everyone deserves happiness.

245
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,085
She's right.

246
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:36,388
Not me. I can't.

247
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:43,228
<i>How would he act this short scene?</i>

248
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:46,298
<i>Senga grappled
with this problem for a month.</i>

249
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:53,005
Looking back,
I see that I was over-thinking the line.

250
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,140
Yokoo was developing his character, too.

251
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:59,111
If I make Hisashi too serious,
it doesn't match his Toshiyuki.

252
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:03,048
When I considered the social dynamics,

253
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:05,851
it balanced out my character very well.

254
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:08,053
-Really?
-I didn't notice.

255
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:12,357
<i>A process of creating
something together as a team.</i>

256

<i>The members had returned
to their roots without knowing it.</i>

257
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:19,164
Wonderful company.
Let's keep this up until the end.

258
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:21,667
-Let's do that.
-Thank you.

259
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:23,535
Let's get some rest tomorrow.

260
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,703
-Yes.
-We all need it.

261
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,904
We do.

262
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:36,949
<i>Kisumai took on a new challenge in 2019.</i>

263
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:47,392
<i>Kitayama was busy preparing for it,
even between magazine photo shoots.</i>

264
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,409
Is that Mandarin?

265
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:05,644
Yeah.

266
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:09,248
People around us are doing gigs overseas.

267
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,949
Times are changing.

268
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:16,755
We need to broaden our horizons, too.

269
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:20,058
It's also exciting.

270
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,762
What does the future hold for us?

271
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,564
How far will we go?

272
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:30,802
Even if we fail,
it will be a learning experience for us.

273
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:38,076
<i>It is Kisumai's
first international performance.</i>

274
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:41,380
<i>They are scheduled to perform in Taiwan.</i>

275
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:52,858
{\an8}<i>How will they be accepted
by the fans in Taiwan?</i>

276
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:57,596
Wait, which was it?

277
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:04,236
<i>The members take Mandarin lessons
to prepare for the occasion.</i>

278
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:08,207
-Eh? "Name?"
-Yes.

279
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:10,442
How do I say it again?

280
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,886
-"Call?" "Called?"
-That's right.

281
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:25,023
I came to Taiwan in search of my princess.

282
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,726
I found her! It's you!

283
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,628
Nice. I like it.

284
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:32,197
What do you think? Will they like it?

285
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:33,565
-They will.
-Great!

286
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:35,167
-Yeah.
-Please teach me this.

287
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:47,346
And?

288

<i>Other groups have performed
in Taiwan before them.</i>

289
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,033
<i>Kisumai must make a strong
and lasting impression, too.</i>

290
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,002
Do I pause after that?

291
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:13,972
Yes. You should add a pause.

292
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,209
I can't wait until the event.

293
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:21,847
The floor will be filled by the audience.

294
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:24,049
I wonder how it will turn out.

295
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:28,654
I hope we can communicate directly
with the people we meet.

with their roller skates?</i>

301
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:03,422
{\an8}It'll depend on
whether we can build up speed.
