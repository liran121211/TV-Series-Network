<i>for a year and a half now.</i>

4
00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:15,115
You were there the whole time?

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,219
You were there the whole time?

6
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:20,587
I'll do my best.

7
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:21,921

<i>They are making their name known.</i>

11
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:04,798
<i>They haven't confined themselves
to the classic idol mold.</i>

12

<i>To improve themselves even more,</i>

13

14
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:12,639
This is bad...

15
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:14,674
My heart is going to give out.

16
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,076
It seemed challenging.

17
00:01:16,142 --> 00:01:18,978
It was a challenge.
The English words all sound the same.

18
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:21,681
I can barely speak Japanese.
How can I speak English?

19
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:24,350
Thank you.

00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:33,793
-Sorry for making you do that.
-It's nice, though...

<i>...all in order to keep the promise

He's someone I love and hold dear

25
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:46,606

26
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,376

I haven't disappointed Mr. Johnny.

27

<i>This time,</i>

39
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:32,519
<i>they must provide their input regarding
their costumes and other small details.</i>

40
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:36,089
For example...

41
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:37,790
{\an8}Everyone has checkered prints,

42
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:41,661
{\an8}so wouldn't using silver
or white sequins here, be better?

43
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:42,562
Like...

44
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:44,998
If it's too simple,

45
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:48,735
it won't be much different
from when we were Johnny's Jr. members.

46
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:51,271
I'm thinking about the end product.

47
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:55,108
A glittery outfit with sequins
isn't what I'm going for.

48
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,678
-As long as it stands out on stage.
-I can definitely add it as an accent.

49
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:01,247
-Using a regular fabric will...
-Right.

Let's talk about "Letter" first.

53
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,128
I want to sit during "Letter."

54
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,030
That's what we had in mind.

55
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:17,931
Yes!

<i>Jinguji will play the acoustic guitar

59
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:35,181
You and Kishi will catch up later,

60
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:36,482
so you two can move.

61
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:38,952
<i>How will they convey the emotions</i>

<i>behind the lyrics

63
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:47,260
This is like a letter written
to our fans, right?

64
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:49,896
We're basically repaying them
for all the letters

65
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:51,164
they've sent to us.

66
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:54,100
Doing an animation
would be too hard, right?

67
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:56,236
-Like...
-Animation?

68
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:57,904
A story based on the lyrics.

69
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:01,140
-We can do that.
-You can?

70
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:02,842
I can imagine it.

71
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,077

-Completely.

Completely?

74

<i>Usually, he doesn't come out
to the forefront,</i>

75
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:14,320
<i>but at times like these,
Jinguji takes the lead.</i>

76
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:18,658

the new dance routine...</i>

80
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:32,705
Hey, Kishi. You should take a break.

81
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,140
-Your focus―
-I'm fine.

00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:35,675
-I'm good.
-Use the restroom.

83
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:37,277
-Let's go.
-Just once.

84
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:39,746

-Maybe about the tour?
-Okay, the tour.

-Tour...
-All right.

-Yay!
-Thank you.

101
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:26,693
It's been awhile, Jinguji.

102
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,294
-It really has.
-Right?

103
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:30,430
Jinguji has wonderful news.

104
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:33,333
Yes. Tomorrow, on Wednesday June 19th,

105
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:36,669
our first album entitled <i>King & Prince</i>

106
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:37,670

00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:39,906
-Yay! Congratulations!
-Thank you.

Johnny's classic idol group...

109
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:46,212
<i>There is a reason why he is advertising
so diligently.</i>

110
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,216
<i>It's because he can't forget
the words spoken by</i>

111
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:52,585
<i>the person who taught him everything.</i>

112
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:57,090
He gave me very honest advice.

113
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:59,192
He said, "Once you release a CD,

114
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:02,495
you will have to start fighting
with numbers."

115
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:04,397
"Once you guys debut,

116
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,299
as the youngest group,

117
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,967
you'll spend your life trying

118
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:11,437
to hit those numbers.
Are you okay with that?" is what he said.

119
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:14,874
Our Johnny's spirit...

120
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:20,113
As part of the one-and-only
Johnny & Associates,

121
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:25,218
I want to be able to proudly
show it off no matter where I am.

122
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:28,721
Can I get the music?

123
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,861
<i>In preparation for their tour,</i>

124
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:38,898
<i>they're practicing a particularly
rigorous dance routine today.</i>

125
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:42,935
I can't memorize it.

126
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:45,338
-It's so hard.
-Man...

127
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:47,607
It's pretty tiring.

128
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:51,177
<i>Hirano joined</i>

130
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:57,984
-One more time.
-I don't remember it at all.

131
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:04,290
<i>There was another reason why he was having
trouble memorizing the routine.</i>

132
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:07,059
My leg hurts.

133
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:11,564
In that moment,
if you can't make it, just...

134
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:12,532
That's true.

135
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:14,734
<i>Perhaps because of the pain,</i>

136
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:17,470
<i>he began to lose focus.</i>

137
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,939
Sho, Sho!

138
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:22,675
He's in his own world.

139
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,311
Oh, no.

140
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:27,447
Sho's spacing out.

141
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:32,151
<i>But he must go on.</i>

142
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:39,759
-Can we start from the beginning?
-Okay.

<i>Hirano's leg pain</i>

144

<i>when they were filming the videos
to use in the concert.</i>

148
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:59,712
When I was in fourth grade,
I danced too much...

149
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:01,747
I practiced so much that my bones

150
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:04,183
were getting worn out.

151
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,085
A torn meniscus, I think.

152
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:09,021
That's what professional athletes get.

153
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:10,289
Yeah.

154
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:12,725
My meniscus was worn out

155
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,494
and I couldn't stretch my leg.

156
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,496
I got surgery,

157
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:22,502
but that still sort of comes back
when I move too much.

158
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:24,403
I shouldn't be dancing, actually.

159
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:27,340
If I don't push myself past my limit,

160
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,043
it won't be a cool performance.

161
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:34,046
I have to push myself
to give a cool performance.

162
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:41,954
So, I'll do my best.

00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:38,010
<i>it's a good opportunity to brush up
on his speaking skills.</i>

178
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:39,378
Want to see it?

179
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:40,846
-May I?
-Sure.

180
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:43,983
After you read their names,
if you say thank you,

181
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,185
it'll leave a good impression.

182
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,955
"Radio handle Nacchan, thank you."

183
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:49,922
Like that?

184
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:51,090
I see.

185
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,592
{\an8}<i>REN NAGASE'S RADIO GARDEN</i>

186
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:55,761
{\an8}Good evening!
I'm Ren Nagase from King & Prince.

187
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:58,965
Well then, let's see.

188
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:04,937
<i>Nagase wanted to make this show a place
where he can honestly express his feelings</i>

189
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:08,107
<i>without putting up any facade as an idol.</i>

190
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:12,078
Our very first theme is,

191
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:15,848
"What is the most popular
girl's school club right now?"

192
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:17,283
Let's start with fifth.

193
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,651
Here it is.

194
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:21,287
I see!

195
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:23,189
Fifth place is the volleyball club.

196
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:25,157
I'll read the messages we got.

197
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:27,159
"They have both glamorous bodies

198
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:32,231
and energetic personalities,
as well as slightly larger breasts.

199
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,900
Even as a woman,
I think they're the best." Exactly.

200
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,502
"Exactly"?

201
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,739
Exactly. The volleyball club...

202
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:44,310
They all have big boobs for some reason.

203
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:49,015
I wonder why?
Do they have volleyballs in there?

204
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:50,750
Breasts...

205
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:53,486
I like butts better, though.

206
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:55,354
I prefer large butts.

207
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,823
-Let's move on.
-Fourth place?

208
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,759
I was told to stop, sorry.

209
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,127
"Sha-la-la Hajikeru Love."

210
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:02,061
<i>Then...</i>

211
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,130
<i>he made one request to the staff.</i>

212
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:07,500
Please keep the volleyball part.
I'm serious.

213
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:10,803
But... you said, "boobs."

214
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,406
Is that not allowed by my agency?

215
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:15,641
They're asking about it now.

216
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,377
-I don't know.
-He's talking about breasts already.

217
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:20,613
What else am I supposed to say?

218
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,647
"Breasts" is okay.

219
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:22,715
They're consulting.

220
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:25,451
I'll leave it up to you, then.
But personally...

221
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,352
Okay.

222
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,120
We got a mild "okay."

223
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:31,390
We'll mildly dig deeper then.

224
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:33,859
Please.

225
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:35,995
I was talking non-stop for an hour.

226
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:38,664
-This is really tiring.
-Right?

227
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:40,599
Radio is interesting, though.

228
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:42,868
Up we go.

229
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:45,204
<i>Each of them are polishing their acts</i>

230
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:49,475
<i>because they want to
strengthen King & Prince.</i>

231
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:54,947
<i>Hirano explained it in this way...</i>

232
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:57,650
We're like the Avengers.

233
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,919
One is active on variety shows,

234
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:03,022
one is an actor,
one is a speaker, and so on.

235
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:05,524
We have strong personalities

236
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,928
and are successful on our own,
but when we come together,

237
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:10,429
we're very powerful.

238
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:12,264
I hope we can be like that.

239
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:19,171
<i>There is one more member
whom they hold dear.</i>

240
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:25,911
<i>They expressed their feelings
in the video for the concert.</i>

241
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:30,783
<i>Watering pink flowers...</i>

242
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:33,385
<i>Pink is...</i>

243
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,688
GENKI IWAHASHI (22)

244
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:39,892
<i>...the color of Genki Iwahashi,
who is being treated for an illness.</i>

245
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,497
<i>The members have never forgotten
that King & Prince</i>

246
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:46,332
<i>is a six-person group.</i>

247
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:49,135
We thought it'd be nice

248
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:52,571
to show us all
making one flower bloom.

249
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:56,142
And we also wanted to show that

250
00:12:56,709 --> 00:13:00,713
Genki was participating in
the concert along with us.

251
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,015
That's why we wanted to start

252
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:07,987
the video with a scene of us
watering pink flowers.

253
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,493
JULY 18, 2019
YOKOHAMA ARENA

254
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,061
<i>And in July...</i>

255
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:20,132
<i>it's one day before the opening day
of their second-year concert tour.</i>

256
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:24,470
<i>They will once again</i>

257
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:29,542
<i>stand on the same stage they stood on
when they debuted one year ago.</i>

258
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,011
-What number?
-Eight!

259
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:34,346
Amazing.

260
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:37,149
Seeing this makes me so excited.

261
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,620
<i>The difference is,</i>

262
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:45,324
<i>they will be using many more
large-scale special effects.</i>

263
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:50,529
<i>Many of which were suggested
by the members themselves.</i>

264
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:53,232
It's rotating.

265
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:54,466
Rotating.

266
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:58,838
<i>The set on the main stage
is able to rotate</i>

267
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:01,040
<i>to show two different designs.</i>

268
00:14:02,741 --> 00:14:06,579
<i>The classic idol image
and the mature King & Prince...</i>

269
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:09,381
<i>Both of their characters
can be portrayed this way.</i>

270
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:12,651
Can we stop here for a moment

271
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:15,187
and perform this song here for a second?

272
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:17,122
Sure.

273
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:23,262
<i>Almost all of the members' requests</i>

274
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:26,065
<i>for stage production
have been fulfilled by the staff.</i>

275
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:31,837
<i>As they go through trial and error,</i>

276
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:34,073
<i>they feel the weight of responsibility.</i>

277
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:44,884
-The stage effects are pretty crazy.
-I know.

278
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,152
I mean, the set itself flips.

279
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:50,756
You only really see
a set flip like that in a theater.

280
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:52,224
That's why

281
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:56,962
I think we can surprise
the people who see it.

282
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,364
<i>However,</i>

283
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,799
<i>this time, there was more than that.</i>

284
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:02,468
-Here we go.
-Okay.

285
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:09,241
<i>The center stage will spin
above the audience like a giant propeller.</i>

286
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,948
<i>The members will stand on a glass floor.</i>

287
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:19,585
<i>It's been made so that the audience
can see them from below.</i>

288
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,590
King & Prince, it's time to move.

289
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:26,825
Will you keep to the right?

290
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,228
-Pick a side.
-Right.

291
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:32,998
<i>This is when tensions begin to rise.</i>

292
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,534
The members are in the front.

293
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,503
The members are facing us.

294
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,839
Just a moment. Okay.

295
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,210
{\an8}<i>ARASHI's Jun Matsumoto.</i>

296
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:50,115
{\an8}<i>The members of King & Prince asked him
to help with stage directing,</i>

297
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:53,419
{\an8}<i>so he is here to do a final check
for his assigned block.</i>

298
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:57,489
Be ready for it to spin.

299
00:15:58,157 --> 00:15:58,991
Go.

300
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:06,332
<i>Matsumoto's eyes have been trained
from directing years of ARASHI's concerts.</i>

301
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:08,701
<i>Where will he be looking?</i>

302
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:11,337
Is this the actual speed?

303
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:13,038
Yes, it is.

304
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:15,507
Go to your bridge positions.

305
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:17,643
Bridge positions? Okay.

306
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:22,348
The bridge starts around here.

307
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:23,482
Ready...

308
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,087
<i>How far each member is from each other</i>

309
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,855
<i>and when they begin moving...</i>

310
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:34,760
<i>He thoroughly checks how
they will be seen by the audience.</i>

311
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:39,932
Make sure the cameras
are directly underneath.

312
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,303
Right now, Sho is...

313
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,939
<i>He lives by the phrase,
"the devil's in the detail"</i>

314
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:48,907
<i>and makes slight changes.</i>

315
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:52,344
-I see.
-I want it to touch.

316
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:54,580
Oh, sorry.

317
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:57,049
I want that part to be a little tighter.

318
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:59,018
At the end. Right there.

319
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:01,687
Are there two lines?

320
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:03,489
-No.
-Three, two.

321
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:05,891
Three and two?

322
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,659
-Three and two.
-Okay.

323
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:10,896
Finish in that position.

324
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,031
Okay.

325
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:20,005
<i>The plethora of things they do to ensure
the audience enjoys every single second,</i>

326
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:23,175
<i>is what creates entertainment.</i>

327
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:29,615
You guys shouldn't
look down too much during this song.

328
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:32,351
-Because the light comes from above.
-Okay.

329
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:37,122
<i>From senior to junior,</i>

330
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:40,626

<i>That is why...</i>

<i>And then...</i>

348
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:26,725
<i>a song in memoriam.</i>

{\an8}SONG POPULARIZED
BY THE FIRST JOHNNY'S GROUP

350
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:53,452
It wasn't in the set list originally,

351
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:59,324
but I really wanted it to reach the person
who is the most dear to us right now.

352
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:00,759
So, I added it in.

353
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:07,733
<i>He sang with the determination</i>

354
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:11,203
<i>that they will stand on
their own two feet from now on.</i>

355
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:14,206
We are...

356
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,275
King &...

357
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:18,577
Prince!

358
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:20,045
Thank you!

359
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:23,415
<i>They will once again embark on
a new journey.</i>

360
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:25,951
Thank you so much!

361
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:29,054
<i>On the next</i> Ride On Time<i>,</i>

362
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:32,324
<i>They get a big opportunity
from a dear friend.</i>

363
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:35,460
{\an8}<i>They battle the pressure...</i>

364
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:38,730
{\an8}Nothing's easy.

365
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:39,931
{\an8}It's hard.

366
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:42,601
{\an8}<i>And on the big day,</i>

367
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:44,836
{\an8}<i>something happens to Kishi's body.</i>

368
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:48,140
{\an8}<i>Will they be able to overcome it all?</i>

369
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:51,109
{\an8}<i>Meanwhile, in the brutal heat,</i>

370
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:53,845
{\an8}<i>other members devote themselves to acting.</i>

371
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:56,415
{\an8}I'll survive with fighting spirit.

372
00:21:57,582 --> 00:22:00,986
{\an8}<i>The promise they made
to someone precious empowers them.</i>

373
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,490
I want to hurry up and make it overseas,
so we can show him.

374
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:07,826
He said, "You guys can do it."

375
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:10,062
I'll put my faith in those words.

376
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:11,563
