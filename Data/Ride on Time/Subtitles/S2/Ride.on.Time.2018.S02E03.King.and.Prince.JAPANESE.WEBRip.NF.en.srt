00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:07,874
<i>One youth is pushing himself
to his limit to become someone new.</i>

2
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:10,276
I can't get any help?

3
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:11,745
You have to do it yourself.

4
00:00:11,811 --> 00:00:13,413
You have to. No other way.

5
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:16,082
<i>Another youth is</i>

6
00:00:16,816 --> 00:00:19,652
<i>watching over his friends
as he fights for someone else.</i>

7
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:22,655
This balance is good.

8
00:00:22,722 --> 00:00:24,524
I agree.

9
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:29,863
<i>These two were about to begin
their challenge.</i>

10
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:56,122
<i>This is documentary series</i> Ride On Time.

11
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:05,765
{\an8}<i>King & Prince's second year
since debuting has begun.</i>

12
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,168
{\an8}<i>Their performances have scaled up.</i>

13
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:16,109
{\an8}<i>They're now showing a new mature</i>

14
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:17,677
{\an8}<i>and sexy side to them.</i>

15
00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:22,082
{\an8}<i>They're looking toward their future.</i>

16
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:26,953
I want to hurry up and make it overseas,
so we can show him.

17
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,722
{\an8}He said, "You guys can do it."

18
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,325
{\an8}I'll put my faith in those words.

19
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:33,927
2019...

20
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:36,696
<i>They were encouraged
by someone dear to them</i>

21
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,765
<i>and were given a big responsibility.</i>

22
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:43,069
{\an8}<i>Yuta Kishi</i>

23
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:46,673
{\an8}<i>and Yuta Jinguji.</i>

24
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,274
{\an8}<i>These two will...</i>

25
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:52,645
{\an8}<i>be a part of the stage play</i> Dream Boys.

26
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:56,382
{\an8}<i>It's a masterpiece that has been
performed by countless seniors.</i>

27
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,052
Will I be able to see

28
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:01,187
you two competing again?

29
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:03,756
<i>It is a story about boys</i>

30
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:05,492
<i>who are childhood friends,</i>

31
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:07,494
<i>and how they overcome many conflicts</i>

32
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,928
<i>and mature through boxing.</i>

33
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:10,897
What's the difference?!

34
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:14,033
From now on,
we'll create our future together.

35
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,507
<i>It features acrobatic performances</i>

36
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:21,574
<i>and is very taxing.</i>

37
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:26,646
{\an8}<i>DREAM BOYS</i> PRESS CONFERENCE

38
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:29,682
{\an8}<i>The number of reporters
who came to the press conference</i>

39
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:32,952
<i>reflects the expectations
put on Jinguji and Kishi.</i>

40
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,691
At first, we were terrified
when Mr. Johnny told us.

41
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,960
That's right. We were like, "Us!?"

42
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:42,095
It's crazy.

43
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:48,735
<i>Will these two succeed
in overcoming this large obstacle?</i>

44
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,644
<i>They begin their practice.</i>

45
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:01,814
This side is the audience,
so try not to turn your back to it.

46
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:02,949
The two of you...

47
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:06,686
<i>First, they begin with
the main focus of the story, boxing.</i>

48
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,857
<i>Of course, they have no experience.</i>

49
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:13,459
It's tiring, huh?

50
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:14,827
It sure is.

51
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:19,866
<i>What's most important,
is to make it look real.</i>

52
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:25,104
<i>Will they be able to pull the viewers
into the story?</i>

53
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:26,906
<i>That is the key.</i>

54
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:31,311
I don't want to look like a novice.

55
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:36,216
<i>Kishi has one more challenge
that he must take up</i>

56
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:37,984
<i>with that same mindset.</i>

57
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:43,189
The strings are really old.

58
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:46,859
<i>In this play, he must play the guitar,
which he has no experience with,</i>

59
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:49,028
<i>and sing a solo part.</i>

60
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,499
-Oh, just this one?
-Yeah.

61
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:57,837
<i>They only have one month
until opening day.</i>

62
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:04,444
<i>Kishi has begun pushing himself
to his limit again.</i>

64
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:10,316
{\an8}<i>Even during their tour,</i>

65
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:13,653
{\an8}<i>he had Jinguji, who can play the guitar,
teach him.</i>

66
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:16,489
I see. The strumming...

67
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:22,795
<i>His hands were constantly on the guitar.</i>

68
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:26,532
<i>Even on their way to the stage...</i>

69
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,069
-See you. I'm Guitar Samurai.
-You're taking that?

70
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:31,638
END OF SHOW

71
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:34,574
<i>At one point, we even saw him like this.</i>

72
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,377
Good work.

73
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,511
Thank you.

74
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:41,881
You're already holding a guitar?

75
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:45,518
They're looking good. A novice's...

76
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:47,420
A novice's blister.

77
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,423
<i>Will he be ready by opening day?</i>

78
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:54,661
Let's do a match.

79
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:55,595
<i>Meanwhile...</i>

80
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:58,798
-That's reckless!
-Shut up.

81
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:02,802
<i>Jinguji was feeling the pressure
during acting lessons.</i>

82
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:06,072
The script isn't ready.

83
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,975
Are you guys in a time crunch?

84
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:10,677
-It's tight.
-Yeah?

85
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:12,078
It's a tight schedule.

86
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:16,916
<i>This time, he will be playing</i>

87
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:22,455
<i>a champion who wants to fight
in the ring despite his head injury.</i>

88
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:25,191
<i>It is a difficult role.</i>

89
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,164
As someone who fought, I know.

90
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,068
Act like you're worried about him.

91
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:36,269
Sit down.

92
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:41,107
<i>Not only does he have to
portray serious emotions,</i>

93
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:43,676
<i>he must overcome one more hurdle.</i>

94
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:45,044
Look...

95
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,815
it's important to never give up.

96
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:54,454
<i>At the end of the stage play,
there is a Show Time slot.</i>

97
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:06,299
<i>Right after they act out a serious role,</i>

98
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:08,801
<i>they must entertain the audience even more</i>

99
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,604
<i>with a performance
including song and dance.</i>

100
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:19,579
IMPERIAL THEATRE

101
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:20,480
<i>On this day,</i>

102
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:24,717
<i>one of their seniors visited
the theater rehearsal room.</i>

103
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:28,755
A line that conveys what is in your hearts

104
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:30,623
to the audience.

105
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,592
{\an8}<i>Kinki Kids member,</i>

106
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:34,360
{\an8}<i>Koichi Domoto.</i>

107
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,931
<i>He is the chairman of Endless SHOCK,</i>

108
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,601
<i>a stage play that has had
over 1,700 showings.</i>

109
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:44,203
<i>This theater expert has volunteered</i>

110
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,339
<i>to help with the stage production.</i>

111
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:52,345
<i>As the two of them
nervously listen to his words,</i>

112
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:56,682
<i>Domoto suddenly brings up
the Show Time slot.</i>

113
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,119
I don't think so.

114
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:02,622
Do we really need the Show Time?

115
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:05,792
Doing that as a form of fan service

116
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:09,729
is kind of a must for Johnny's theater.

117
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:12,532
That's how I feel.

118
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:16,302
I don't think Mr. Johnny would say that.

119
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:19,672
He told me if the main act is good,
you don't need Show Time.

120
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,410
-What do they want to show?
-Right...

121
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:26,846
-It's about what you want to show.
-Okay.

122
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:33,386
<i>Will they be able to satisfy
the audience without Show Time?</i>

123
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:43,029
It's good that you're contemplating.

124
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:45,665
They care about their fans.

125
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:48,835
Nothing like Koichi back in the day.

126
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:53,105
<i>What Domoto wanted to relay to them
was the importance of</i>

127
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:56,175
<i>thinking on their own
and deciding on their own.</i>

128
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:01,814
<i>In order to stand on their own
as performers,</i>

129
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:04,183
<i>that is the most important thing.</i>

130
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:08,054
FOR DREAM BOYS

131
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,422
<i>Actually, this time,</i>

132
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:13,092
<i>there was a performance
that Kishi requested himself.</i>

133
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:15,928
That's good.

134
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:21,033
<i>It involved this cube.</i>

135
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:24,871
<i>Controlling the movements of this cube</i>

136
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:26,339
<i>is quite hard.</i>

137
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,875
It takes a lot of muscle.

138
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:30,676
-Just do a little at a time.
-Yes.

139
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,013
Bring your hand closer to your face.

140
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,916
<i>He loses track of time
and immerses himself in practice.</i>

141
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,486
<i>Sweat drips down his back.</i>

142
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:44,957
This is no good.

143
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,425
My hands aren't working.

144
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:48,294
You're probably very tired today.

145
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,562
That's true.

146
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:52,231
-You have to keep aiming higher.
-Right, higher.

147
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,066
That's the minimum requirement.

148
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:55,034
-The minimum.
-Yes.

149
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:56,936
-I'll work on that.
-That's good.

150
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:58,337
I want to go higher.

151
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:00,072
-Like this?
-Right.

152
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,209
<i>He doesn't just twirl the cube.</i>

153
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:07,380
<i>They also use it in the flying routine.</i>

154
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:11,284
-Oh, no!
-It's okay.

155
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:14,287
<i>He must support this cube
with just his neck.</i>

156
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:15,221
Okay.

157
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:18,758
<i>Just in case the cube falls,</i>

158
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,929
<i>they planned to have female performers
below him as insurance.</i>

159
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:24,530
<i>However...</i>

160
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:27,767
Can I give you my opinion?

161
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:30,803
I want him to get through it alone.

162
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:32,104
Without any help.

163
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:33,806
-Without help?
-Yes.

164
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:36,075
-You have to take the risk.
-I agree.

165
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:37,443
They're not your mothers.

166
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,279
-I can't get any help?
-You have to do it yourself.

167
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:41,847
You have to. No other way.

168
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:42,882
I see.

169
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:48,454
<i>Jinguji was watching over Kishi.</i>

170
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:52,925
Nishikiori once said that he thought

171
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:58,864
theater was a boat.
The entire cast is on the ship.

172
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:02,034
No one can just get off the boat.

173
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,202
We're all stuck there.

174
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,405
Once you leave port, you can't go back.

175
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:07,573
All of you

176
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,676
have to make it to the goal.
That is how theater is.

177
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:12,979
Go.

178
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:14,614
<i>Being on the same boat</i>

179
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,582
<i>and sharing the same fate...</i>

180
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:19,619
<i>That applies to King & Prince
as a group as well.</i>

181
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,455
<i>The two of them can work hard</i>

182
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:25,324
<i>because no matter
how difficult things are,</i>

183
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:28,327
<i>they have each other,
members who are determined</i>

184
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:30,730
<i>to survive the rough waters together.</i>

185
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:35,001
Ready...

186
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:36,369
{\an8}DRAMA SHOOTING

187
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:39,071
{\an8}<i>In the extreme heat,
exceeding 35 degrees Celsius,</i>

188
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:42,241
{\an8}<i>Nagase is starring in a drama.</i>

189
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,480
-It's so hot.
-I need tape over here.

190
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,384
<i>But he is determined
to keep a smile on his face.</i>

191
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,521
I'm with the other actors
and actresses the whole time,

192
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:59,759
so I want to create
a positive atmosphere on set.

193
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:03,329
That's what I'm aiming for.

194
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,164
{\an8}Ready...

195
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:06,666
{\an8}Go.

196
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,802
{\an8}<i>Another member
who faced a challenge on set</i>

197
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:11,437
{\an8}<i>was Kaito Takahashi.</i>

198
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:15,841
{\an8}<i>He is acting alongside his senior,
Shori Sato,</i>

199
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:18,511
{\an8}<i>and trying to live up to
everyone's expectations.</i>

200
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:19,779
Cut.

201
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:22,415
-Was that good?
-Okay.

202
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,186
<i>His role is that of
an energetic high-school boy.</i>

203
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,458
Chuya.

204
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,426
<i>However...</i>

205
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:35,828
-Chuya.
-Yes, I'm Chuya Tsukioka!

206
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:38,397
I made it in time. That was close.

207
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,902
Cut.

208
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:46,172
-The general flow was good.
-Okay.

209
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:49,742
That just looked like
a regular kid who's late.

210
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:52,778
I want you to almost
start a Chuya Tsukioka show.

211
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:59,719
Naturally,
I'm not a very energetic person.

212
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:01,921
-Five times more energetic.
-Five?

213
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:04,323
Be conscious of that
and it will be just right.

214
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:07,560
-Tsukioka.
-Yes, I'm Chuya Tsukioka!

215
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:09,862
I made it in time. That was close.

216
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:13,199
-Chuya Tsukioka.
-Yes!

217
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:15,868
I'm Chuya Tsukioka! I made it in time.

218
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:16,836
That was close.

219
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:19,772
Cut.

220
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:23,142
Okay.

221
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:24,643
<i>He somehow got it down.</i>

222
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:27,012
Hey!

223
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:29,014
Good morning.

224
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:31,150
Yesterday...

225
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:36,522
I was up late working on my manga.

226
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:40,025
I was supposed to work on it today too,
but I finished it yesterday.

227
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:42,561
I'll survive with fighting spirit.

228
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:49,935
<i>Each of the members are
fighting their own battles.</i>

229
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:52,605
Oh, no...

230
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:54,840
-Was I sleeping?
-Just for a bit.

231
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:59,812
{\an8}PORT MESSE NAGOYA

232
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,814
{\an8}<i>They were on tour at the same time.</i>

233
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,954
<i>What can they do
to make their fans even happier?</i>

234
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:11,023
<i>They keep trying new things.</i>

235
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:15,928
We were talking about it earlier,
but during "Betsubetsu no Sora,"

236
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:18,597
would it be too much
to dance in the aisle?

237
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:21,667
{\an8}MAKOMANAI SEKISUI HEIM ICE ARENA

238
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:26,405
{\an8}<i>On this day, Hirano and Kishi
visited the local staff in Hokkaido.</i>

239
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,608
-We want to learn the dialect.
-Dialect?

240
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:31,210
-<i>Namara</i>?
-<i>Namara</i>.

241
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:33,746
-Oh, like "<i>namara</i> good."
-Like, "seriously good."

242
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,148
-<i>Osasatta</i>.
-<i>Osasatta</i>?

243
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:39,351
-Like, "time has <i>osasatta</i>."
-Meaning, "time has flown"?

244
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:41,086
-Thank you.
-No problem.

245
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,788
-<i>Oshitatta</i>?
-<i>Osasatta</i>.

246
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:44,156
<i>Osasatta</i>.

247
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:47,193
-<i>Osasatta</i> and <i>namara</i>. Thank you.
-No problem.

248
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,829
<i>Namara</i>, <i>osatatta</i>.

249
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:51,430
Was it <i>oshitatta</i>?

250
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:53,933
<i>Kishi-kun</i>

251
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,267
<i>More, Kishi-kun</i>

252
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:58,003
<i>Namara</i> be mine.

253
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:01,173
I <i>namara</i> want to hold you.

254
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:06,245
<i>With their fans,</i>

255
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:09,415
<i>they continue on their voyage
on this boat called</i>

256
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:10,850
<i>King & Prince.</i>

257
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:21,794
<i>As they rehearse for</i> Dream Boys<i>,</i>

258
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:25,464
<i>Kishi looks especially happy.</i>

259
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:28,067
-I bought a guitar.
-Huh?

260
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:29,468
-I bought a guitar.
-Really?

261
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:31,036
Did you splurge?

262
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:33,806
I couldn't help it.

263
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:39,311
<i>A guitar made by a famous manufacturer.</i>

264
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:44,183
<i>He is known to be a frugal person,</i>

265
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,987
<i>but he splurged in order to
raise his own morale.</i>

266
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:52,558
-That's a really nice guitar.
-That's why I have to get better.

267
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,927
-Each player has a unique sound.
-I see.

268
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:04,303
-That's good.
-Okay.

269
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:08,274
<i>Their rehearsals are coming to an end,</i>

270
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,677
<i>and today is the scene
that talks about the importance of dreams.</i>

271
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:15,814
People can't live without dreams.

272
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:18,250
But dreams don't always come true.

273
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,586
What's important...

274
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:23,289
<i>Domoto, who's helping
with the production, is there.</i>

275
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:25,090
Some don't come true.

276
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:30,529
You became number one
in the harsh world of boxing.

277
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,865
When you say,
"in the harsh world of boxing",

278
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,633
right here,

279
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:38,137
it doesn't really reach the heart.

280
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:40,272
Saying "in the harsh world of boxing" here

281
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:44,310
-creates a world of boxing right there.
-Okay.

282
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:46,445
If you do that, the listeners empathize

283
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:48,213
-with the lines better.
-Okay.

284
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,785
That may be better.

285
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:55,354
<i>At that moment, Kishi...</i>

286
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:57,957
Then it clicks in my mind

287
00:15:58,023 --> 00:15:59,091
that I don't care.

288
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:00,759
At that moment,

289
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,662
-can I be like this?
-You can stand. Of course.

290
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:06,732
I don't care about winning.

291
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,734
<i>"I want to stand and deliver my line."</i>

292
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:11,303
<i>Kishi proposed his own idea.</i>

293
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,942
You became number one
in the harsh world of boxing.

294
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,081
I don't care about winning.

295
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:24,616
As long as we can...

296
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:28,687
use our gloves
to recover our bond that was broken.

297
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,191
That was much better.

298
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:34,693
-I'll go with that then.
-Perfect.

299
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:35,995
Let's do that.

300
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:41,333
<i>Thinking and deciding on his own.</i>

301
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:44,603
<i>He was able to take one step forward.</i>

302
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:46,905
Take the net away.

303
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,341
<i>Opening day is nearing.</i>

304
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:52,678
Don't let go.

305
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,683
IMPERIAL THEATRE

306
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,985
<i>It's opening day for the stage play,</i>

307
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:01,253
Dream Boys.

308
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,455
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

309
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,924
<i>Jinguji looks the same as usual.</i>

310
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:09,061
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

311
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:10,629
<i>On the other hand, Kishi...</i>

312
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,965
-Your throat?
-What?

313
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:14,500
My throat's sensitive.

314
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:16,035
I see.

315
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:20,072
<i>It's rare to see him with a sore throat.</i>

316
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:22,241
Good morning.

317
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:27,212
<i>He was holding an inhaler
to care for his throat.</i>

318
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:30,149
Stage rehearsal will begin in ten minutes.

319
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,084
This is seriously bad.

320
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:36,055
Good morning.

321
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:37,356
<i>Despite that,</i>

322
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:39,425
<i>he begins the final check.</i>

323
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:43,962
I had a fever the other day,

324
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:46,865
-and my throat never recovered.
-I see.

325
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,501
It's so raspy.

326
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:51,270
Sorry.

327
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:53,338
<i>That wasn't all.</i>

328
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:57,443
Can we make it colored?

329
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:01,380
<i>He suddenly started feeling pain
in his left arm.</i>

330
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:04,683
TEN MINUTES UNTIL SHOWTIME

331
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:05,617
<i>Still...</i>

332
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:06,752
YUTA JINGUJI, YUTA KISHI

333
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:12,624
<i>No matter what his condition is,
he will stand on stage.</i>

334
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,628
<i>Because that's what he was taught</i>

335
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:19,398
<i>by the person he holds dear
and his seniors.</i>

336
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:24,503
-Break a leg.
-Excuse me.

337
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,105
<i>The stage play,</i>

338
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:29,808

is about to raise the curtains.</i>

339
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:34,613
<i>The time has come.</i>

340
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:04,409
<i>They both went down to 55 kg
and built up their bodies.</i>

341
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:12,184
<i>As he promised,</i>

342
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:14,153
<i>he did the cube by himself.</i>

343
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:32,371
<i>The guitar which he never put down...</i>

344
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:48,387
<i>The characters they've each built up...</i>

345
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:54,393
You became number one
in the harsh world of boxing.

346
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:58,163
I don't care about winning.

347
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:01,133
As long as we can use our gloves

348
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:04,203
to recover our bond that was broken.

349
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:06,772
Look...

350
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,142
it's important to never give up.

351
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:12,077
No matter what happens,

352
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:13,979
you can never give up.

353
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,316
You want to become the champion, right?

354
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,788
<i>And the finale...</i>

355
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,724
<i>They both decided to do the Show Time.</i>

356
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:28,594
<i>They finished the show with a performance</i>

357
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,462
<i>that lured in the audience.</i>

358
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:36,034
-Thank you for coming today.
-Let's meet again.

359
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:37,102
Thank you.

360
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,272
Thank you.

361
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:43,575
{\an8}It was fun.

362
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:46,311
{\an8}Some scenes gave me goosebumps
as I was acting.

363
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:49,615
{\an8}It was an amazing experience.

364
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:52,651
{\an8}<i>And Kishi...</i>

365
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,319
{\an8}Thank you.

366
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:57,389
{\an8}I'm sure Mr. Johnny was watching.

367
00:20:57,456 --> 00:21:02,127
{\an8}I did everything I could to perform
in a way that would get his approval.

368
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:05,297
{\an8}I think I was able to perform
with my head held high.

369
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:07,399
I'll work even harder.

370
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:09,234
-There's still more.
-Yes.

371
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:11,003
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

372
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:12,371
Good work.

373
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,607
<i>That spirit...</i>

374
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:19,311
{\an8}<i>is passed on to them next.</i>

375
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:24,116
I do feel like
I don't want to lose to them.

376
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:28,220
<i>These three will guide the large boat</i>

377
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,255
<i>and depart.</i>

378
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:32,491
{\an8}TOMOYUKI YARA (36)

379
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:34,393
{\an8}<i>Next time, it's Tomoyuki Yara.</i>

380
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:39,898
<i>As one of Johnny's best dancers,</i>

381
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,601
<i>what is this lone performer
going up against?</i>

382
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:47,372
I don't want Johnny's members
to be looked down on.

383
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:50,208
{\an8}He is the one-and-only member

384
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:52,711
{\an8}who specializes in dancing, I believe.

385
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:56,615
<i>In his 25th year as a Johnny's member,</i>

386
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:58,116
<i>what is his resolve?</i>

387
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,886
{\an8}He spends all of his time

388
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:06,325
{\an8}trying to perfect whatever he does,
and I fell in love with his perseverance.

389
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:10,262
<i>He aims for the biggest stage
in the world.</i>

390
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:13,265
If you take away dance,
I will have nothing left.

391
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:15,934
