The tour went by in the blink of an eye.

3
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:13,113
Today is the last show.

4
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:15,415
-Right? How sad.
-I know.

5
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:19,119
-Did you put your nose on already?
-Yeah, I did.

6
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:20,186
I see.

7
00:00:20,253 --> 00:00:21,654
It's always on my face!

8
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:23,056
Ha!

9
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,132
We're already making fools of ourselves
on <i>Ride On Time</i>.

10
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:36,936
-Sorry.
-Sorry about that.

11
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:38,471
-We're dumb.
-Sorry.

12
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,840
This is our appeal.

13
00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:41,875
Where are we going?

have ranked number one on the hit charts.</i>

21
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:41,401
<i>What do the members think
their group's appeal is?</i>

22
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:48,141
{\an8}I think it's how we're not very idol-like.

23
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:52,212
{\an8}That's definitely our strength, I'm sure.

24
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:58,218
We even have an in-group unit
called "Busaiku."

00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:30,116
I'm not. I'm ugly.

32
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:31,684

64
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:20,426
We must prove what we can accomplish
when it's just us four.

65
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:22,895
We are being put to the test.

the younger brother who takes care of him.</i>

82

{\an8}They can do that using dictation software.

83

<i>Miyata has the most acting experience
of the Busaiku members.</i>

84

<i>However, he has never played
the role of a blind man.</i>

85
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:46,479
I don't want you
to try and help him as his eyes.

86
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,381
{\an8}Guess what?

87
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:52,485
{\an8}Yesterday, they asked me
if I wanted to work full-time.

88
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:54,854
{\an8}-They did?
-Yeah.

89
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:59,225
{\an8}But I don't know.

90
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:05,298
{\an8}<i>Miyata must convince the audience
that he is really blind.</i>

91
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,799
That's good news.

92
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:11,070
Maybe you look this way
when you're talking.

93
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:12,739
-Oh, I get it.
-Right?

94
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:18,277
When you're happy,
you might react with your body.

95
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:23,049
Then it seems like you're reacting
to what's going on here.

96

<i>How will he get into character?</i>

97
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,325
Don't let our eyes meet...

98
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:34,060
This is difficult.

99
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:36,229
-It is.
-So hard.

100
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,533
"Really?" I can't look at you like this.

101
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,935
You're totally looking this way.

102
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:45,138
But I know you're in this direction.

103
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:49,242
He can still tell which direction
the voice is coming from.

104
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:52,078
But if I turn towards your voice,

105
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:55,815
it looks like we are looking eye to eye
as we talk.

106
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:01,854
I can't stop myself
from relying on my eyes.

107
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:05,591
To not be able to see...

108
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:07,226
This is tough.

109
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,463
-Don't you think?
-Totally.

110
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:14,400
-It created a buzz, didn't it?
-It did.

111
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:24,544
It's a beautiful day out.

116
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,993
{\an8}That sounds about right.

117
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:46,632
{\an8}I've already been blind half my life.
How time flies.

118
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:49,168
What about the photos?

119
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:53,906
How will I take them?
From up here or down here?

120
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,175
There are many blind photographers.

121
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:58,978
Like I wrote in the script,
they rely on other senses

122
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:01,781
like smell and the feeling in the air.

123
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:06,686
Many blind photographers
exist around the world.

124
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,991
But would they take photos like this?
Or down here?

125
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:13,292
-It depends?
-I guess so.

126
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:15,328
It depends on the individual.

127
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:20,032
I'll do some research into that myself.

128
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:22,835
You're right.
There's no need to hold the camera up.

129
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:26,873
<i>Yokoo likes to research thoroughly
before getting started.</i>

130
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,878
<i>It is lunch break between rehearsals.</i>

131
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:44,123
He's watching our show.

132
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:46,659
He is?

133
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,962
He loves it.

134
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,032
He loves Kisumai.

135
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,336
We only have a 45-minute break.

136
00:08:57,403 --> 00:09:00,907
Yet, he doesn't eat or rest.

137
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:05,244
He uses it to watch us on a variety show.

138
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:06,712
Unbelievable.

139
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:09,849
He hasn't laughed once
since the show began.

140
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:13,286
He hasn't?

141
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:17,990
<i>Yokoo uses all his time
to think about Kisumai.</i>

142
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:24,630
What is an idol anyway?

143
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:26,933
I think about it these days.

144
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:32,738
Snow Man and SixTONES will have a CD debut
in January 2020.

145
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:35,441
There are many younger members
beneath them.

146
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:38,611
Kisumai are approaching their thirties.

147
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:43,015
That means we need to find our niche.

148
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:48,220
We need to think and figure that out,

149
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,289
or else we will no longer have gigs.

150
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:54,560
Right now, we're just riding along a path

151
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,662
that our seniors laid out for us.

152
00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:00,366
I want to create something and pass it on

153
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:04,537
to those who come after us,
as a group or as individuals.

154
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:07,206
{\an8}BUSAIKU

155
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:12,044
{\an8}<i>The four members have been able to form
Busaiku and rise to acclaim</i>

156
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:15,514
{\an8}<i>because of the support their seniors

{\an8}<i>A surprise guest appeared
on the first Busaiku live tour.</i>

159
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:35,368
{\an8}<i>It was Masahiro Nakai.</i>

160
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:48,014
<i>It was Nakai
who produced and named Busaiku.</i>

161
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:08,367
{\an8}How does this look?

162
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:11,170
{\an8}How is the gap between songs?

163
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:13,939
{\an8}There's a light here. Oh, it turned on.

164
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:17,810
What you see on stage is totally different
from the audience.

165
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:23,516
At least one member should observe
from off-stage before the real show.

166
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,886
Maybe you're one-seventh of a group
when performing as Kisumai,

167
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:29,822
but you're not each just one quarter
of Busaiku.

168
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:31,557
You are each one whole.

169
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:35,194
You need to each carry your load,
or this will flop.

170
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:36,362
-Remember that.
-Yes.

171
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:38,364
-Give it all you got.
-Yes, sir.

172
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:40,366
If you mess up, I'm going to bust you up.

173
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:42,234
-Yes, sir.
-We'll do you proud.

174
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:47,940
<i>These words from Nakai</i>

00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:51,777

{\an8}I'm mature now.

178
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:03,255
Before,
I thought I was just a member of a group.

179
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:08,494
Now I see myself as an individual.

180
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:12,064
Since then,
my attitude has changed completely.

181
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,668
I think it has.

182
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:20,539
So, wherever I go, I am me.

183
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:23,576
Hi.

184
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:31,250
<i>Nikaido follows Nakai's example

<i>Nikaido knows what that feels like.</i>

192
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:13,459
You messed up on the trampoline.

193
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:16,962
-He sucks.
-Yep. This guy sucks.

194
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:18,697
You cracked me up.

195
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:19,799
Oh, hey!

196
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:22,334
Only you messed up.

197
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:23,502
I was too nervous.

198
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:27,039
-What's up?
-He messed up the trampoline.

199
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:28,874
You were like this on the ground.

200
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:30,709
I fell and went down on my knees.

201
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:32,311
Oh, shoot.

202
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:34,647
You're always here when we mess up.

203
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:37,683
That was so uncool.

204
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,220
That's harsh. You're so harsh.

205
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:42,555
Unbelievable.

206
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:46,025

208
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,296
You were so wobbly.

209
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:54,200
So many criticisms. I can't handle it.

210
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:56,735
But you did well. It was amazing.

211
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:57,703
Thank you.

212
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:02,541
Nakai has had a big influence on me.

213
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,444
He took good care of Kisumai.

214
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:09,849
He's always been so caring
towards Busaiku, too.

215
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:17,256
I've felt so much love for us from him.

216
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:21,694
Nakai has been a huge influence on me.

217
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,799
I care about them a lot.

218
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:37,543
<i>The play's set is ready.</i>

219
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,511
<i>Their preparation is reaching its climax.</i>

220

<i>Miyata is playing a blind man.</i>

221
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:51,724
<i>How will he capture not only the movements
of the character but also his mind?</i>

222
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:03,235
Sorry! I took too long to get ready.

223
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:09,308
<i>In this scene,
Hisashi leaves the house first but stops.</i>

224
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:12,244
<i>Toshiyuki understands many things
just from this action.</i>

225
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:16,482
Hisashi? What's the matter?

226
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:21,787
So, he comes...

227
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:26,558
Though they are in a hurry,
he doesn't hear footsteps.

228
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,027
Hisashi?

229
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:30,029
What's the matter?

230
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:34,066
You're getting the hang of it.

231
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:35,834
Yeah, I get it.

232
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:37,903
-I get it.
-Now I see.

233
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:42,308
It's not a scene between the three
from the beginning. It just you two.

234
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:45,010
-See.
-I misunderstood.

235
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:52,017
<i>Everything is done by trial and error.</i>

236
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:04,897
<i>Miyata is usually cheerful.</i>

237
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:08,267
<i>However, recently,
he has become a man of few words.</i>

238
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:19,311
<i>There are only a few more days left
of rehearsals.</i>

239

<i>Busaiku is starring in a play

240
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:34,994
<i>Yokoo is playing a blind man,
and Senga is playing his younger brother.</i>

241
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,762
<i>Time is running out.</i>

242
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,100
-Hey there!
-Hi.

243
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,535
You sounded like a woman.

244
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:47,573
<i>Yokoo does not seem to be anxious.</i>

245
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,942
<i>He carries out the rehearsals diligently.</i>

246
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:53,579
They live upstairs...

247
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:59,651
<i>However, he is still trying to figure out
how to use the camera.</i>

248
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:08,560
I need to remember that later I will carry

249
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:10,429
both the camera and a white cane.

250
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:11,930
That's right.

251
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:14,066
Okay. I'll keep that in mind.

252
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:23,442
<i>Senga is having a difficult time
figuring out his role.</i>

253
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:27,012
Yes. You want to see him off.

254
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:31,717
You need a girlfriend!

255
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:34,820
<i>This is the scene he is stuck on.</i>

256
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,189
-I'm not popular with girls.
-What?

257
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:38,690
No way.

258
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:39,658
You lie!

259
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,960
You deserve a good girl.

260
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:43,996
-He does.
-Yeah.

261
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:48,267
He's had it rough, living alone
with his brother since he turned 17.

262
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:53,372
A person like me
doesn't deserve happiness.

263
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:56,508
Don't be stupid.

264
00:17:57,943 --> 00:18:02,281
I don't deserve to be happy, ever.

265
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:06,385
<i>"A person like me
doesn't deserve happiness."</i>

266
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:10,456
<i>Senga is unsure how to deliver this line.</i>

267
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:13,659
Yeah, totally.

268
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:15,260
I...

269
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:18,197
I don't deserve it.

270
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,403
<i>The brothers have a complicated past.</i>

271
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:27,206
<i>Senga has yet to figure out</i>

272
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,408
<i>how to express it in his acting.</i>

273
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,214
That's how Mom died.

274
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:39,318
I have quite a few things to work out.

275
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:41,320
You mean emotional matters?

276
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:43,889
Yes, I can't decide yet.

277
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:47,893
How should I portray the younger brother?

278
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,964
Is it better if I play Hisashi

279
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,700
as more innocently juvenile?

280
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:57,202
Or is it better...

281
00:18:57,736 --> 00:19:02,107
if I play him more neutrally?

282
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:03,108
In my opinion...

283
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:07,880
<i>Senga can't seem to get into character.</i>

284
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:11,316
<i>The key is that line.</i>

285
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:14,753
I still can't figure it out.

286
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:20,759
"A person like me
doesn't deserve happiness."

287
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:23,562
That's where I get lost.

288
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:28,233
From then on,
everything seems to fall apart.

289
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,802
Meaning?

290
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:34,907
What is the emotion behind this line?

291
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:37,142
Uh...

292
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,079
Is it like,

293
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:43,982
"A person like me
doesn't deserve happiness!"

294
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:48,687
I guess he could be upset.
That makes sense, too.

295
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:50,522
Should he be suppressing the emotion?

296
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:54,526
I don't know
if suppress is even the right word.

297
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:56,962
What is it?

298
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,399
Is it despair?

299
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:04,469
I don't know how to express it.

300
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:11,710
<i>Senga has been recognized for his dancing,</i>

301
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:15,681
<i>but he is taking on this play
with a new determination.</i>

302
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:27,993
I haven't had much experience as an actor.

303
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:32,965
What will I create out of this role?

304
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:36,635
How will I let the role take over me?

305
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:41,073
What new side of me will I discover?

306
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:47,679
I guess...
this is more of a mental challenge.

307
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,250
I'm looking forward to finding out.

308
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:59,391
<i>Senga is rehearsing hard
to get into character.</i>

309
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:03,495
Just you two brothers alone.
It must have been tough.

310
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:10,502
A person like me
doesn't deserve happiness.

311
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:11,870
Eh?

312
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:14,873
Don't be stupid.

Everyone deserves happiness.

316
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:29,755
That's right.
