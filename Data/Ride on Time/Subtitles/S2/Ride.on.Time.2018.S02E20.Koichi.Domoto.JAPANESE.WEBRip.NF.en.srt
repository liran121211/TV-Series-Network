00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:09,542
{\an8}<i>The curtain is about to rise on a musical.</i>

3
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,520
{\an8}<i>Koichi Domoto, 41 years old.</i>

4
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:25,992
<i>He has been the star of this musical
for two decades.</i>

5
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:27,193
-Get in!
-Hurry up!

6
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,963
-Yusuke, over here!
-Hurry!

7
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,032
One, two!

8
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:35,068
One more time. One, two. Okay, Got it.

9
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:40,273
<i>We witness the determination of a man</i>

10
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:44,878
<i>who has chosen to dedicate
his life to the stage.</i>

11
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:03,196
{\an8}<i>Koichi Domoto writes, directs,
and stars in the musical...</i>

12
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:05,031
{\an8}Endless SHOCK.

13
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,036
{\an8}<i>Its history dates back to 2000.</i>

14
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:13,606
{\an8}<i>when Johnny's first took
to the Imperial Theatre</i>

15
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:15,375
{\an8}<i>with</i> MILLENNIUM SHOCK.

16
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:18,178
{\an8}<i>Domoto was 21 years old.</i>

17
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:28,421
<i>The tickets have been selling out
for two decades.</i>

18
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:31,124
<i>Domoto is now in his forties.</i>

19
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:35,929
<i>He continues to perform
dramatic action scenes every year.</i>

20
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:46,139
Do you feel any resistance

21
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:48,475
towards getting older?

22
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:50,543
Not really.

23
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:54,881
I perform in front of an audience.

24
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:57,417
That is my occupation.

25
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:03,089
In each stage of my life,
there's something I can only express then.

26
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:10,697
I began this musical when I was 21.

27
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:14,501
I never imagined myself
still doing it in my forties.

28
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:16,970
Not at all.

29
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,075
But I am.

30
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:26,713
Why am I still doing this?
I puzzle even myself.

31
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:51,738
<i>This is documentary series</i> Ride On Time.

32
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,178
<i>The musical</i> Endless SHOCK

33
00:02:58,244 --> 00:03:02,815
<i>is a story about young men and women
dreaming of making it big on Broadway.</i>

34
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:08,888
People! That final stage was great!

35
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:12,859
<i>Domoto is playing the role</i>

36
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:16,896
<i>of the troupe leader
who dedicates himself to theater.</i>

37
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:20,266
<i>It is similar
to his position in real life.</i>

38
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:46,426
This was the last show after a long run.

39
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,695
You can go crazy in rejoicing.

40
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:56,502
<i>There are 47 people in the cast.</i>

41
00:03:57,203 --> 00:04:01,708
<i>Each small gesture comes together
to create the atmosphere on stage.</i>

42
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:08,881
I want you to open up
as you sing the chorus.

43
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:13,419
I want you to sing and project it forward.

44
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:16,022
Could you keep that in mind for me?

45
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,457
Got it.

46
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:30,870
Thanks, guys.

47
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:36,209
It's a small but important difference.
Please don't forget it.

48
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,478
Don't forget to look forward.

49
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:40,113
There's so much
blank space to fill.

51
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:44,517
Especially for
the Johnny's Jr. parts.

52
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:47,220
We don't have very many lines.

53
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,123
However, we are present on stage.

54
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:53,860
It's up to us to fill that silence.

55
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:57,830
It's a difficult task.

56
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:01,234
Is <i>SHOCK</i> different from other musicals?

57
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,870
Yes, I think so.

58
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,839
The troupe leader is our director.

59
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:10,109
That makes things unique.

PRESS CONFERENCE

63
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:21,788
{\an8}<i>Since Domoto is the director,</i>

64
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:25,792
<i>there's a question that he is always asked
before the run begins.</i>

65
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,764
I'm sure this question will come up later,

66
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,567
"Do you have anything new planned
for this show?"

67
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:36,736
Let me answer that now. No, I do not.

68
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:56,155
<i>Since 2019, they have increased the size
of the orchestra.</i>

69
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:59,959
<i>The music is now richer and more dramatic.</i>

70
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:18,878
{\an8}<i>The next production must be better
than the last.</i>

71

{\an8}MUSIC DIRECTOR
MASAHIRO HASEGAWA

73
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:25,518
{\an8}The high notes... What's my cue?

74
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:27,920
"When you lose sight
of your surroundings."

75
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:30,423
-Start right then?
-Yes.

76
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,725
{\an8}That scene where you start singing,
"Fearlessly..."

77
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:33,693
{\an8}ACTRESS
BIBARI MAEDA

78
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,727
{\an8}We have an idea.

79
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:37,730
{\an8}We want to add some music.

80
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:40,933
-We want unease.
-I see.

81
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:42,869
Shall we try?

82
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:47,940
When it comes to that line...

83
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:50,076
I get it. Understood.

84
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:54,781
After a note like this,
you will start singing your song.

85
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:57,049
-This sound?
-That's your cue.

86
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:59,218
-We're still working on it.
-I get the idea.

87
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:05,091
There will be sounds like this.
Then you will start your song.

88
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:06,793
You move away during these?

89
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:08,761
-Yes.
-I understand.

90
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:12,832
I like the first note,
but the rest is too much.

91
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:15,034
-It's too nervous?
-Yes.

92
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,969
-Too suspenseful?
-Yeah.

93
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:19,372
-The following notes.
-Gotcha.

94
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:22,041
That's a bit...

95
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,210
-Too much?
-Yes.

96
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:29,482
Not like this?

97
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:32,685
Suspenseful.

98
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:33,953
How about this?

99
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:38,391
Then start the song.

100
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,492
Let's keep it simple.

101
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:41,861
Let's try it.

102
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:46,699
If performing on a larger stage
will be to our benefit,

103
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,702
I am willing to give it a shot.

104
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:52,805
You will? Great!

105
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:57,043
If that's what you want,
I am here to support you all the way!

106
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:02,849
Koichi? Is something the matter?

107
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,652
No... I'm fine.

108
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:10,089
When you lose sight of things,

109
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:12,325
you're done for.

110
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,222
-Does that work for you?
-Absolutely.

111
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,158
-It works.
-They like it?

112
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:48,027
They who?

113
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:50,096
Who are you talking about?

114
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:52,598
From the actor's point of view,

115
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:55,601
I felt that the music
portrays my feelings well.

116
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:56,836
I'll take note.

117
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:59,605
Can you write it in here
so that the orchestra knows, too?

118
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:02,275
These are all tiny differences.

119
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:04,977
Uh...

120
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:12,852
The media often asks me these questions
in interviews.

121
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,857
"How will you evolve?"

122
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:20,293
"What changes will you make?"

123
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:27,166
I fully understand why they want
to ask me that.

124
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:31,837
But what is evolution?

125
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:37,109
Do I have to make changes?

126
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:43,115
Those are my honest reactions
to those questions.

127
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,520
It'll be obvious if we change the music.

128
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:52,224
But, I'm more interested in the details.

129
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:56,862
Sometimes the smallest adjustments
in timing

130
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:01,267
can be much more important.

131
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:06,839
Even if I tell the media that, though,
they won't find it interesting.

132
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:09,742
What will they say?

133
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:11,978
"That doesn't give me an article."

134
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:16,148
"We're turning on the light in this scene
half a second faster than before."

135
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:19,018
"So what?"

136
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:23,255
That's what happens
when you have a long run.

137
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:30,696
<i>What is evolution?</i>

138
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,867
<i>What does it mean to be "new"?</i>

139
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:52,718
You seem so happy, Bibari.

140
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:55,521
I love the stage.

141
00:10:57,023 --> 00:11:03,162
Each year, Koichi brings us something new.

142
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:07,667
Each year, I am excited to find out
what he will come up with.

143
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:14,240
One step at a time, he is trying
to form a musical style created in Japan.

144
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:17,243
I admire his hard work and attitude.

145
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:20,513
That's why I want to go along
for the ride with him.

146
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,716
Do you want a larger part?

147
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:25,184
I do!

148
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:29,822
I want to have more dance scenes.

149
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:41,567
<i>The enthusiasm of the cast
fills in the blank space in the script.</i>

150
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:47,540
<i>The motivation of the troupe lies
in the dedication to this show</i>

151
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:50,509
<i>as shown by their troupe leader.</i>

152
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:58,718
How are you going to take responsibility?

153
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:00,319
We still have a second act!

154
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,421
You think we can do a second act
like this?

155
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,490
Enough.

156
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,759
The stage has a life of its own.

157
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:09,762
It's up to us to tame it.

158
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:15,067
No. Professionals do exactly
as they're required to.

159
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:17,737
Stop it.
Have you ever heard Koichi complain?

160
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:20,639
<i>This scene,
where a crew member erupts with anger,</i>

161
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:23,576
<i>is crucial to the story development.</i>

162
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:26,078
{\an8}That's why I'm warning him now!

163
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:27,146
{\an8}Tatsuya.

164
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:32,585
{\an8}<i>Tatsuya Ueda was chosen
to play Domoto's rival for the first time.</i>

165
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:36,155
We've lost all respect!

166
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:37,556
Tatsuya!

167
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:39,492
Enough.

168
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:42,495
You're no longer welcome on this stage.

169
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:49,869
Isn't my character making a good point?

170
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:50,870
He is.

171
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,404
Right?

172
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:54,807
-A very good point.
-I thought so.

173
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:58,611
Tatsuya is actually being very reasonable.

174
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:01,747
In a way,
it's Koichi that's running out of control.

175
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:06,051
That's the intention of the script.

176
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:13,259
I wrote the script
so that they're both being reasonable.

177
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:19,031
Which way do you think
I should portray him?

178
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,501
Should Tatsuya be a little immature?

179
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:25,704
No, I don't think that's necessary.

180
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:28,474
-So, I'm totally reasonable.
-That's right.

181
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:35,314
<i>The actors discuss things
to add more depth to the story.</i>

182
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:40,085
In a way, Koichi is abusing his power.

183
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,188
Yes. I think you're right.

184
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:45,457
-Tatsuya is very reasonable.
-You are.

185
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:50,029
"I don't get it.

186
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:55,901
I don't get it,
but this is what the script says.

187
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:59,271
I'll just read it as it's written."

188
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:04,243
That's the most boring way to act.

189
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:09,248
To be honest, that's how I was
when I first started on <i>SHOCK</i>.

190
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:13,252
I hated that, so I took an active director
and screenplay role from 2005 onwards.

191
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:16,222
What's the best way to express this?

192
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:19,024
I'm not criticizing Mr. Johnny at all.

193
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:21,760
Mr. Johnny was a visionary.

194
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:26,465
He was leaps and bounds ahead
of what I could ever imagine.

195
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,701
Yeah.

196
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:32,304
{\an8}2002
<i>SHOW GEKI SHOCK</i>

197
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:38,344
{\an8}SHOCK <i>is a show that was originally
written and directed by Johnny Kitagawa.</i>

198
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:44,583
{\an8}<i>It focused on action and illusion shows
over the storyline.</i>

199
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:57,363
{\an8}<i>However, in 2005,
Domoto rewrote the story,</i>

200
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:59,765
{\an8}<i>and he decided to
direct the production, too.</i>

201
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:04,236
{\an8}<i>This was the beginning of
the</i> Endless SHOCK <i>that is performed today.</i>

202
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:11,410
{\an8}<i>It is a story of conflict and strife
for young people in showbiz.</i>

203
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:13,946
{\an8}Enough.

204
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:18,817
{\an8}You dance and sing for naught
if you lose sight of what's important.

205
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,453
"Show must go on."

206
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:26,025
No matter what happens, it must continue.

207
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:31,697
{\an8}<i>The flashy performances were replaced</i>

208
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:35,134
{\an8}<i>with ones that embodied the lives
of the characters.</i>

209
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:38,537
{\an8}<i>The show won wide acclaim.</i>

210
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,772
{\an8}2008: WON KAZUO KIKUTA THEATRE AWARD

211
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:41,307
{\an8}2019: JAPAN'S MOST PERFORMED
SOLO-STAR MUSICAL

212
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,847
<i>For 20 years,</i>

213
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:54,787
<i>Domoto has dedicated himself
as a stage performer</i>

214
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:57,222
<i>to this one production.</i>

215
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:12,805
You have many opportunities
aside from <i>SHOCK</i> to choose from.

216
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:17,676
Do you not wish to perform in other shows?

217
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:21,580
You're right. There are other shows.

218
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,483
{\an8}I was finally able to do <i>Knight's Tale</i>.

219
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:27,086
{\an8}MUSICAL <i>KNIGHT'S TALE (2018)</i>
STARRING KOICHI DOMOTO, YOSHIO INOUE

220
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:33,993
{\an8}I was able to do that,
but <i>SHOCK</i> became too famous.

221
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:38,197
So, since about ten years ago,

222
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:42,234
I've asked to do other gigs.

223
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:45,604
However, I was told that I represent <i>SHOCK</i>

224
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:50,642
and the Imperial Theatre.

225
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:56,382
Therefore, if I did something else,
I'd be tainting their names.

226
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,619
Was that a dilemma?

227
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:05,224
For a while, it was a dilemma for me.

228
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,660
Yes.

229
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:12,831
I tried to convince myself

230
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:16,335
that it was a privileged dilemma.

231
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:18,937
Yeah.

232
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:24,276
Most people don't get to perform
in the Imperial Theatre even if they want.

233
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:30,883
I was suddenly offered that chance.

234
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:32,418
Yet, I wanted to do more?

235
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:36,889
Sure, that was selfish of me.

236
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:41,160
At least, that was what I tried
to make myself think.

237
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:43,195
Yeah.

238
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:46,398
Do you acknowledge yourself?

239
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:48,734
Have you ever acknowledged yourself?

240
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,174
Acknowledge...

241
00:17:57,843 --> 00:18:00,045
I don't know about acknowledging.

242
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:06,618
However,
I've decided to be proud of myself.

243
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:11,356
For example, Mr. Johnny always told us

244
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:14,259
to do something
that only we can accomplish.

245
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:19,231
He always kept saying that to us.

246
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:24,837
In a way, I think <i>SHOCK</i> is something
that only we can do.

247
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:30,742
I am proud of that.

248
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:41,019
<i>Domoto is on a mission
to do something only they can accomplish.</i>

249
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:45,591
<i>The sword battle is one of the highlights
of the show.</i>

250
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:51,630
<i>Twenty-two cast members fight
for 15 minutes with all their might.</i>

251
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:05,911
<i>It is the result of pursuing a scene
that would be unique to</i> Endless SHOCK.

252
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:26,431
I want people to love the show.

253
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:32,171
I want everyone to be fans of <i>SHOCK</i>.

254
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,543
That's all.

255
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:40,045
I've never wanted the attention
for myself.

256
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:44,883
If there ever comes a time when I retire,

257
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:49,288
would the musical <i>SHOCK</i> also end with me?

258
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:51,456
Really?

259
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:55,694
Is that acceptable?

260
00:19:57,629 --> 00:20:01,366
If that were the end of this show,
I would start questioning myself.

261
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:06,104
If this show is going to end with me,

262
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:12,077
what have I been doing this for?

263
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:23,889
Koichi!

264
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,337
Thanks. Let's take a 30-minute break
like the real show.

265
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:42,174
We will resume and start Act Two
from 6:30 p.m.

266
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:51,717
I'm so sorry.

267
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:08,734
<i>Domoto is the troupe leader and director.</i>

268
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,874
Can I use your pen?

269
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,577
Sure, but that's not my pen.

270
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:19,845
It's not?

271
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:30,489
I can't write because my hand is shaking.

272
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:41,333
<i>He is about create yet another year
of</i> Endless SHOCK.

273
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:50,509
{\an8}<i>On the next episode,
we continue following Koichi Domoto.</i>

274
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:51,943
{\an8}You plunge in.

275
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,912
{\an8}But you have to halt your movement.

276
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:58,450
{\an8}<i>This year's</i> Endless SHOCK
<i>is about to begin.</i>

277
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:00,686
{\an8}Regarding this show,

278
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:05,524
{\an8}I know that the next few months
are going to be hell for me.

279
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:08,327
{\an8}Let's do our usual!

280
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:09,461
{\an8}One, two!

281
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:11,997
{\an8}Show must go on!
