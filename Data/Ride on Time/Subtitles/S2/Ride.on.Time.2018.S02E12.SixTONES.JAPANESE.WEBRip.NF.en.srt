{\an8}OKINAWA, DECEMBER 23, 2019

2
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:06,766
SixTONES!

3
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,105
<i>These cheers</i>

4
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:15,408
<i>carry SixTONES into the future.</i>

5
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:40,600
<i>This is documentary series</i> Ride On Time.

6
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:44,938
{\an8}It's just the shoes.
Tie your laces, please.

7
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:46,573
{\an8}They'll slip off.

8
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:51,411
{\an8}Shin-chan and Jesse
didn't have them done up.

9
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:54,247
<i>SixTONES is just about to debut.</i>

10
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:55,381
<i>December.</i>

11
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:59,652
<i>Preparations for the group's tour
of Japan in the new year are proceeding.</i>

12
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:06,626
Three times forward. Back first. Okay!

13
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:09,963
-Forward three times. Use your weight!
-Come on!

14
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:15,135
Weight forward!

15
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:18,471
One more time! Weight forward!

16
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:22,108
Stop!

17
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:26,346
You can't drink the day before this.

18
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:29,449
Rolling forward is tough.

19
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,552
Is this how high it will actually be?

20
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:33,920
-It will be higher.
-Huh?

21
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,155
<i>A new challenge.</i>

22
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:39,726
<i>Everything from now on
is an unknown world to SixTONES.</i>

23
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,766
Go!

24
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:52,172
One! Two!

25
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:54,040
Okay, three!

26
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:56,042
I can't sing like this!

27
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:06,085
<i>A once distant dream
is about to become reality.</i>

28
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:08,221
I guess they're from the school.

29
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:12,258
I was deciding what it was I wanted to do,

30
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:15,528
and it was here that I decided.

31
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:18,064
So, I guess it's also somewhere

32
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:22,468
that I made a big decision, really.

33
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:26,339
<i>Before the group make their debut,</i>

34
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:30,777
<i>Morimoto visits someone he's known
since childhood who run a surfing shop.</i>

35
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:33,780
Hello!

36
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:36,549
-Long time no see.
-Shintaro! It's been ages.

37
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:40,720
-You always came here.
-Yes.

38
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,789
I was here every weekday at lunch.

39
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:44,791
I think I've already told you,

40
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:46,759
but I'm in a group called SixTONES

41
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:49,162
and we're debuting on January 22.

42
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,064
Or is it the 23rd? No, it's January 22.

43
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,298
-Thank you.
-Congrats.

44
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:54,267
That's the main news.

45
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:55,835
At last!

46
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:56,903
SHOP OWNER
MR. FURUYA

47
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,839
You've been working your butt off.

48
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,174
I've watched you closely.

49
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,009
{\an8}<i>I always called you "Mini Tackey".</i>

50
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,544
{\an8}But when I called you that,

51
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:06,312
{\an8}if anything, you seemed to get mad.

52
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:07,814
{\an8}<i>MYOJO</i>, AUGUST 2008 ISSUE

53
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:09,282
I don't remember that.

54
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:12,986
I don't remember why I got mad. No.

55
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:16,889
-Shin-chan!
-Oh!

56
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:22,295
Congratulations! Wow, this takes me back!

57
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:24,197
-I went, you know!
-Where to?

58
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,199
<i>This is the surf shop family's mother.</i>

59
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:30,069
<i>When she heard Morimoto was here,
she dashed over.</i>

60
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,372
-With my mom? Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

61
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,207
Stop that!

62
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,710
-I bet this is nostalgic.
-Sure is!

63
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:40,480
I surfed on this.

64
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:46,819
<i>The surfboard he used
when he was in high school.</i>

65
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,024
It has "Shintaro" on it.

66
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:54,961
Look, it's got his autograph on it.

67
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:57,597
This brings back memories!

68
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:01,234
You'd come back complaining you wiped out,

69
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,902
then go back and try harder.

70
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:06,339
-Over and over again.
-That's right.

71
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:10,510
It was really, really frustrating.

72
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:12,745
Going in... Yeah.

73
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:24,057
Dust is flying everywhere.

74
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:27,593
Because I haven't worn it in ages.

75
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,000
I left it inside-out on purpose.

76
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,469
You can see how old it is.

77
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:37,704
Yeah!

78
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:41,841
I thought he could wear it again
if he stayed the same size.

79
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,677
Maybe I have.

80
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:46,679
-Maybe.
-Yeah.

81
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,949
I'll put it here
so you can come back any time.

82
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,384
Thank you.

83
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:54,921
Thank you so much, really.

84
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:56,689
Oh, my...

85
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:59,425
-It's getting serious.
-January, then?

86
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:00,326
January.

87
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:02,995
-You might be too good for us.
-Don't be silly.

88
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,632
-Once you've debuted.
-No.

89
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,535
Not as long as I have somewhere
to come back to.

90
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:11,337
It'll be fine.

91
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:14,774
I'd love it if you fancied some surfing

92
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:17,643
-and came to show your face.
-Yeah.

93
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,778
Someone will be here.

94
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:20,413
-Yes.
-Yeah.

95
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:28,554
<i>What kind of world awaits him after this?</i>

96
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,425
I always just floated.

97
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,060
Like those people.

98
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:41,768
I was just drifting on the waves,

99
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:43,903
deciding whether to carry on or not.

100
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:48,408
And wondering what the future
had in store, too.

101
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:58,084
If you have no work,
you find out about the world.

102
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:03,189
The harshness of show business.
The harshness of adult society.

103
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:07,493
It was only because
I got to experience all of that

104
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:12,198
that the time where I had nothing to do

105
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:15,334
was really scary to me.

106
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:19,505
It was through experiencing
things like that

107
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:26,546
that my job as part of SixTONES
became incredibly enjoyable.

108
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:30,349
We want SixTONES to be like SixTONES.

109
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:34,053
And being like SixTONES
is something we won't compromise on.

110
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:39,325
So, if they ever do try to change us,
I think I'll put up quite the fight.

111
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:46,232
I mean, after all I've gone through,
I'm confident I have the answers.

112
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,168
I have faith in everyone.

113
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:53,506
That's exactly why

114
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:56,576
if it's for the other five's sake,
I'd fight all on my own.

115
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:01,781
{\an8}<i>"Do you like SixTONES?"</i>

116
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:03,749
{\an8}I do. Yeah...

117
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:05,785
I guess so.

118
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:11,257
There'd be lots I couldn't do
if it weren't for SixTONES.

119
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:14,627
There are more things that SixTONES
helps me out with.

120
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:18,064
We're together because we like it.

121
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,302
I hesitated just now

122
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:26,973
because if I say that I like SixTONES,

123
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,809
I think the other guys
will all say I'm lame!

124
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:32,445
"I'm out," they might say.

125
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,347
So, I had to think about my answer.

126
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:38,518
But I do like them. Everyone.

127
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:42,088
I think that's why I want to fight.

128
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,031
It still looks the same.

129
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,005
She's playing the piano!

130
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:04,911
<i>An important encounter
opened up his destiny.</i>

131
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:09,682
<i>Before the debut,
Jesse also has someone he wants to see.</i>

132
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:11,851
MUSIC ROOM TWO

133
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:13,586
She's singing!

134
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,122
How nostalgic!

135
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:19,458
Hey!

136
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:22,762
-Hello.
-Hello.

137
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,232
-This brings back memories.
-Yes!

138
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:27,433
It's been a while.

139
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,068
-Do you remember me?
-Of course!

140
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:30,303
Are you sure?

141
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:32,271
{\an8}-I used to have long hair.
-You did?

142
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:33,806
{\an8}MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHER
MRS. SHIMIZU

143
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:35,608
{\an8}I'm the one who wanted to meet up!

144
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:36,909
{\an8}Yeah!

145
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:40,346
My, you're all grown up!

146
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,415
Do you remember that portrait?

147
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:47,053
<i>It's the music room he always
eagerly came to in middle school.</i>

148
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:50,623
<i>This is where it all started for Jesse.</i>

149
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:54,694
As I was reflecting,

150
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,330
and wondering where
my musical life began...

151
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:59,231
And I still have a long way to go.

152
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,969
I remember you

153
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:05,004
dealing with all the sopranos,

154
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:07,940
and I was on the edge
with my loud, deep voice.

155
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:10,076
I don't go by "Lewis" anymore,

156
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:12,845
but you said, "Lewis, you should
join the music club."

157
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:14,814
You encouraged me more and more.

158
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,117
And I didn't get good marks in my tests,

159
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:22,688
but my performing and singing
did get me praise.

160
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:23,723
That's right.

161
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,992
Was it on the other side? Over there?

162
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:30,062
I was having a guitar lesson over there.

163
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:34,934
"This isn't working out.
I can't play guitar," I said.

164
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:37,803
Then when you said I should play guitar,
it was like,

165
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:41,107
"I see, and that will open up
lots of other paths."

166
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:45,277
Here, you can play A minor, D minor
and E7 like back then.

167
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:47,813
I hate Fs.

168
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,781
Back then...

169
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,550
Minor. A minor.

170
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:52,752
A minor. This?

171
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,920
Two from the bottom, three from the top.

172
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,622
-Here?
-That's it.

173
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,895
D thirteen.

174
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:04,330
D thirteen.

175
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:05,264
Ready?

176
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,002
A minor. A minor of love.

177
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:11,904
I remember that, "A minor of love".

178
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:14,073
Go one more down.

179
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,374
Ready?

180
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,245
And back to where you were.

181
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:20,880
-Two, three, two.
-This one?

182
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:23,616
Three from the top. Ready?

183
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,389
-I remember doing this.
-You did this.

184
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:31,791
-Good times.
-Yes.

185
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:35,261
Why do you think music
is so important to you?

186
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:37,897
Huh, I wonder.

187
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:42,435
I couldn't live
without listening to music.

188
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:45,037
When I'm in bed or in the shower...

189
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:45,938
Traveling...

190
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:48,374
There's always music there in your world?

191
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:50,042
-There is.
-That's good.

192
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:52,645
I always want to feel a rhythm.

193
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,014
-A rhythm?
-Yes.

194
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:57,683
I do like a good ballad.

195
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,754
Something by Koji Tamaki, like "Melody."

196
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:04,223
So, you look up to Tamaki?

197
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,126
Well, Tamaki's the best in Japan,
isn't he?

198
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:12,364
Are you not writing music anymore?

199
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:17,636
When all of you were still here
in your last year,

200
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:21,173
I really put my heart and soul into it.

201
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,908
So, since then I haven't...

202
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:26,378
<i>There's a song by his teacher
that's full of memories.</i>

203
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,082
-Do you remember?
-Yes.

204
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:31,484
"GUIDEPOST"

205
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:33,519
Let's see...

206
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,894
I'm so happy you're singing it.

207
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:46,165
Do you want to do the first bit?

208
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,868
I'll do the second bit.

209
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:57,510
<i>You were always walking ahead of me</i>

210
00:12:57,576 --> 00:13:03,015
<i>I looked up to you from behind</i>

211
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:08,654
<i>I just tried to work as hard as I could</i>

212
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:14,126
<i>Hoping you would compliment me</i>

213
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:19,098
<i>Looking back now that time has passed</i>

214
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:24,837
<i>From the happiness of being relied upon</i>

215
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:30,075
<i>To showing off and feeling your kindness</i>

216
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:33,379
<i>It made me want to protect you</i>

217
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:34,513
Take it away.

218
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:40,286
<i>At some point, I realized</i>

219
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:45,424
<i>That there's a path both in front of
And behind me</i>

220
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:50,663
<i>Joined by the bonds of love</i>

221
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:55,267
<i>Is the warmth of people</i>

222
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:58,037
<i>Thank you, thank you</i>

223
00:13:58,103 --> 00:14:00,639
-<i>Thank you
-Thank you</i>

224
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:07,279
<i>I won't forget this path</i>

225
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:11,250
<i>I'll always keep it in my heart</i>

226
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:16,355
<i>As I walk on with pride</i>

227
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:20,559
<i>Down this path</i>

228
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:27,066
<i>Thank you</i>

229
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:34,406
I like that.

230
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:38,777
-What lines do you like?
-All of them, but the chorus is great.

231
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:40,813
Like an explosion of emotions.

232
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,282
"Thank you."

233
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:45,918
Simple words,
but surprisingly hard to say.

234
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:48,921
Thank you. I made it for graduations.

235
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:52,491
I've recreated the "Be Yourself" sign.

236
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:55,427
I've always told everyone that.

237
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:58,097
Everyone has their own unique voice.

238
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:00,366
Lots of kids come up
from elementary school

239
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:02,768
with no confidence
saying that they hate singing.

240
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:06,538
The point of singing is to unleash
all the things you're feeling inside.

241
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:08,807
So, you should do it in your own way.

242
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:12,044
I'm sure you'll face
lots of difficult things, Jesse,

243
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:15,748
but never embellish or disguise yourself.
Only you can be Jesse.

244
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:19,318
I want you to stay the wonderful way
you already are.

245
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:21,487
That's my wish.

246
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:25,891
"Path" in the song can also
mean "guidepost."

247
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:29,194
There's always an "ahead" and a "behind,"
and you can get lost.

248
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,664
So, when you're lost,
to keep making progress,

249
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:34,934
you use music to... How can I put it?

250
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,002
To give yourself something solid.

251
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:56,322
<i>At some point, I realized</i>

252
00:15:56,388 --> 00:16:01,060
<i>That there's a path both in front of
And behind me</i>

253
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:04,930
<i>Joined by the bonds of love...</i>

254
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:10,402
<i>Thank you, thank you</i>

255
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,770
<i>I won't forget...</i>

256
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:14,940
<i>That there's this path</i>

257
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:23,115
Music is something I really...

258
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:30,389
We all share it. It doesn't betray us.
Everyone has their own tastes, of course.

259
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,426
We're perfectly ordinary.

260
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,861
We want to show the fans

261
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:42,301
something different from all
the Johnny's groups who've come before us.

262
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:47,506
I'd like things to stay like this,

263
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:53,545
but be a really big star.

264
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:58,550
It's funny, though.

265
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:00,586
We got together when we had no fans,

266
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:05,457
and now we've done all sorts of work

267
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:09,161
and people come to see us when we go
on hall and arena tours.

268
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,802
It's interesting.

269
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:21,640
I always thought we'd get here.

270
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,456
<i>SixTONES' debut is imminent.</i>

271
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:42,728
<i>All of the time until now
is about to take one single form.</i>

272
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:43,796
All done!

273
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:48,734
Our fans are always supporting us.

274
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:53,605
Whether it's magazine articles,
or polls...

275
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:56,875
It's the same on social media, too.

276
00:17:56,942 --> 00:18:00,979
When we started our YouTube channel,
our fans helped us out so much.

277
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:04,917
And before we knew it,
that support had created real results.

278
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:06,218
Thanks to the fans.

279
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:08,954
I'm not just being nice.

280
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:12,558
I really... Well, I think
a lot of people feel this.

281
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:14,326
But I really feel it.

282
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,500
I'm really feeling it.

283
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:28,140
We've missed out on making our debut
so many times.

284
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:31,310
I thought we'd run out of chances.

285
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:33,212
It was really painful.

286
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:36,215
I couldn't think of anything positive.

287
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:40,319
There are so many with Johnny's Jr.
who have more talent than me.

288
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,421
What's special about me?

289
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:46,625
Does SixTONES need me?

290
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:50,062
To be honest, I'm still unsure now.

291
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,797
I feel uneasy every day.

292
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:56,835
Thank you for following
six idiots like us.

293
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:30,789
JANUARY 22, 2020
SIXTONES' DEBUT

294
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:33,258
I like the smiles.

295
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:35,427
{\an8}<i>Up next, it's King & Prince.</i>

296
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:40,265
<i>They take on a show compiling the work
of the man who brought them here.</i>

297
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:44,269
I think Mr. Johnny purposely didn't
explain what "show must go on" meant.

298
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:48,674
<i>They ask themselves the question
of what it means to stand on the stage.</i>

299
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,143
Doing the shows are a sign of peace.

300
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:53,545
And we can do the shows
because there is peace.

301
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:57,983
<i>Their feelings for the man
who taught them everything burst forth.</i>

302
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,319
Let's work hard from now on.

303
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:01,253
Let's work hard.

304
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,689
-How was it?
-I was so moved.

305
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:07,426
<i>Sights set on the next show,
they devote themselves to improving.</i>

306
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,395
If I don't do this,
I doubt I can go on living.

307
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:14,199
<i>They forge their path
into their third year.</i>

308
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:15,934
