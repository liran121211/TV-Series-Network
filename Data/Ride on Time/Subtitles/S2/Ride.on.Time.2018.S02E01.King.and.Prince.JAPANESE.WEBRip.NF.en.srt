00:00:01,935 --> 00:00:05,572
THIS SUMMER THEY LOST SOMEONE DEAR TO THEM

2
00:00:05,638 --> 00:00:09,909
AND STARTED A NEW JOURNEY

3
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:14,647
If we hadn't learned
what we did from Mr. Johnny...

4
00:00:14,714 --> 00:00:15,548
{\an8}YUTA KISHI (24)

5
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:18,852
I don't know what
we would've been doing now...

6
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:24,257
I hope we're powerful enough
that it reaches Mr. Johnny.

7
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:28,228
{\an8}He gave me constructive criticism
until the very end.

8
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:29,429
{\an8}YUTA JINGUJI (21)

9
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:33,066
He wouldn't say I was bad,
just suggest a better way.

10
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:35,335
He said he'd be watching me.

11
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:37,604
He really was watching.

12
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:39,339
But that made me happy.

13
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:40,907
He told me that

14
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:44,344
I would find out
my own strengths one day.

15
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:47,347
I want to always keep that in mind

16
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:52,585
and be able to tell Mr. Johnny
that I'm confident in myself.

17
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:55,722
I don't think Mr. Johnny
would want that.

18
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:56,689
REN NAGASE (20)

19
00:00:56,756 --> 00:00:59,059
He wouldn't want people
crying for him.

20
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:02,128
If I ever...

21
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:04,998
see him on the other side,

22
00:01:06,699 --> 00:01:09,669
I want to make sure
I haven't disappointed Mr. Johnny.

23
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,640
He said my first name
could be spelled "Show"

24
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:16,643
as in show business
and entertainment.

25
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:19,813
At first, I didn't understand
what he was talking about,

26
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:23,817
but now, I feel like it was my destiny.

27
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:24,717
Actually...

28
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:29,722
I almost feel like I was destined
to meet Mr. Johnny

29
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:32,959
ever since my parents named me Sho.

30
00:01:33,893 --> 00:01:35,361
It feels like fate.

31
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:01,688
<i>This is documentary series</i> Ride On Time.

32
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:09,362
<i>Last January,
the debut of a group was announced.</i>

33
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:10,897

34
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:15,969
It's my first time doing this,

marched forward,</i>

38
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:28,214

AUG. 10, 2018
YOKOHAMA ARENA

40
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:34,687

-Good work.
-I'm tired.

46
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,173
-Hello.
-We watched you guys.

47
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:57,844
I do feel pressure
doing any type of work, honestly.

48
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:01,848
Now that we've debuted,
it's to be expected.

49
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:04,684
For the bartender role...

50
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:07,854

-That's terrible!
-Sorry!

<i>The youngest member, Kaito Takahashi,

<i>Ren Nagase, the group's MC from Kansai,

59
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:35,315
They all have big boobs for some reason.

64
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,068
A story based on the lyrics.

00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:56,502
-We can do that.
-You can?

66
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,104
We can.

67
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,675
<i>They've raised their game</i>

68
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:05,211

<i>On this day, they were shooting

It smells like...

74
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,071
I'm at a concert.

75
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:34,073
<i>They appear in costumes</i>

76
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:36,676
<i>that differ in style

It's cold.

78
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:41,614
<i>They're wearing mostly black.</i>

MARCH 15, 2018
ROPPONGI, TOKYO

80
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,188
<i>In their first year,
their songs, dances, and costumes</i>

81
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:51,591
<i>had a prince-like style.</i>

82
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:59,432
<i>This time, they will take on
a song with a mature air.</i>

83
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,478
Wait, this is hard.

84
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:14,647
This is hard.

85
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,118
<i>Most of the lyrics are in English.</i>

86
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,322
I wasn't ready to use my brain
this morning.

87
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:24,457
Okay, should we try?

88
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:26,426
-All right!
-Show your stomachs!

89
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:27,894
Yes!

90
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:29,095
Music please.

91
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,099
<i>To show a new side of them,</i>

92
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,601
<i>they've changed
their style of dancing as well.</i>

93
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:43,976
<i>They dance a sexy, hip-hop style routine</i>

94
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:47,480
<i>for the entire song that is
three and a half minutes long.</i>

95
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:54,120
<i>Although they break it up
into several parts to film,</i>

96
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:56,322
<i>it is quite the workout.</i>

97
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,226
This is bad...

98
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:02,195
-Ten-minute break.
-Okay.

99
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:04,263
My heart is going to give out.

100
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:05,631
This is tiring.

101
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:07,600
This is...

102
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:09,369
just exhausting.

103
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,672
<i>They've just learned the routine.</i>

104
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,741
<i>Though filming part by part,</i>

105
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:17,443
<i>the members are spent
just trying not to mess up.</i>

106
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:21,013
<i>But the staff...</i>

107
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,883
We'll do one long take.

108
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,485
What did you say?

109
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:26,853
One long take.

110
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:28,221
All or nothing.

111
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:31,224
-Are you serious?
-I am.

112
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,393
-Will it be on the DVD?
-I'll add it in.

113
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:34,560
I'd like that.

114
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:35,461
If we can do it.

115
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:37,263
-I see.
-It's one shot?

116
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,365
-All or nothing.
-I know, right?

117
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:41,200
The last chorus...

118
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:44,904
<i>Can they dance for
three and a half minutes with no mistakes?</i>

119
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:47,573
We can definitely do it.

120
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,574
I believe in myself.

121
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:49,475
Okay.

122
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:52,445
Let's do our best and dance.

123
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:54,647
-Yeah.
-Kinpuri Fighters, let's go!

124
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:56,582

126
00:06:57,817 --> 00:06:59,685
What is Kinpuri Fighters?

127
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:02,121
-Music please.
-Okay.

128
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:15,735
ABOUT 1 MINUTE IN

129
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:21,541
ABOUT 2 MINUTES IN

130
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:29,048
ABOUT THREE MINUTES IN

131
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:35,321
AFTER ABOUT 3 MINUTES AND 30 SECONDS

132
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,726
Cut!

133
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:41,694

136
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:50,970
That was good.

137
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:52,872

138
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,207
So tired!

139
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:56,275
Our desire has become stronger.

140
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:58,978
-In a good way.
-Almost like a craving?

141
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,981
Everyone has their own focus.

142
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:06,385
Ren is doing the costumes,
Kaito does dance routines and production,

143
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:10,122
Jinguji looks at the overall picture,
and so do I.

144
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,459
Hey! Find something for me!

145
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:15,761
At least include me
in that group with you!

146
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,697
I almost didn't catch that.

147
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:20,700
-Just say all three of us do that.
-I ran out of ideas.

148
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:23,803
I don't blame you.
I was searching for a focus myself.

149

00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,085
-You're early today.
-You were here earlier than me.

178
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:47,453
Wow...

179
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:50,256
I haven't seen you act
this idol-like in so long.

180
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,091
-How rude.
-No, no.

181
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:53,759
-I am an idol.
-I know.

182
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:55,861
You haven't seen me be idol-like?

183
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,463
We always see you, so...

184
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,565
<i>Hirano seems to be in high spirits,</i>

185
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:03,669
<i>but in an interview after this,
he says something unexpected.</i>

186
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,304
That's true...

187
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:09,675
I was on a live music TV program yesterday

188
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:12,478
and I met a lot of my seniors.

189
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:17,617
Some were skilled at talking,
some were skilled actors, and so on.

190
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:20,553
I thought to myself, what is going to be

191
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:23,889
my skill as a Johnny's member?

192
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,759
All the members
do separate jobs, you know?

193
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:29,595
As I wondered
what field I should focus on,

194
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:32,131
I became anxious and fell asleep.

195
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:34,100
Yeah.

196
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,235
I know...

197
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,204
I haven't...

198
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,538
<i>His body was</i>

199
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,141
<i>reacting honestly to his emotions.</i>

200
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:46,479
I try to drink something warm
to take care of my throat.

201
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,714
By the way, Kishi said...

202
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:49,982
<i>It may be from fatigue,</i>

203
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:52,218
<i>but he was getting a rash.</i>

204
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:53,953
That's what they told me

205
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,421
at the hospital.

206
00:10:55,955 --> 00:11:00,860
I wonder if lack of sleep has something
to do with it too.

207
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:04,764
I easily get sick after a big job.

208
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:07,566
My body lets its guard down.

209
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:08,934
After I get off stage we do...

210
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,703
Was it called <i>san</i>-<i>san</i>-<i>nana</i>?

211
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:11,704
The <i>sanbonjime</i> cheer?

212
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:13,305
Yeah, <i>sanbonjime</i>.

213
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:17,276
I've gone straight to the hospital without
even doing our <i>sanbonjime</i> post-show cheer.

214
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,945
The other day,

215
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:22,982
I was throwing up backstage too.

216
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:27,787
I will be careful not to let
my immune system get weak.

217
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:32,324
<i>And still,</i>

218
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:34,694
<i>as long as there's a camera filming him...</i>

219
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,095
Good morning.

220
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:37,997
Thank you.

221
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,766
Why are you still filming?

222
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,469
In documentaries,
they film people walking away.

223
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,571
-Oh, I understand.
-No, no, no.

224
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,541
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

225
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,843
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

226
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:53,579
How embarrassing.

227
00:11:56,615 --> 00:12:00,619
<i>The other members are also
feeling the pressure just like him.</i>

228
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:08,327
{\an8}<i>Today, they are learning the dance
for their other new song, "Koi-Wazurai."</i>

229
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:13,499
<i>Because all of the members are busy</i>

230
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,135
<i>and they don't have much time to practice,</i>

231
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:18,771
<i>each one gets
their own professional dancer</i>

232
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:20,172
<i>to teach them.</i>

233
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:23,275
One more time.

234
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:25,611
One, two...

235
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:30,850
Okay, in thirty minutes,
we'll try running through it

236
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,284
-together as a group.
-Yes.

237
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:33,753
-We'll take a break...
-Oh, no.

238
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:35,855
-...and meet in 30.
-My brain is fried.

239
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,259
<i>Even during break time,</i>

00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:42,895

<i>is Kishi.</i>

242
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:47,299
<i>He continues to dance without resting.</i>

243
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,703
Hey, Kishi. You should take a break.

244
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,104
-Your focus―
-I'm fine.

245
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:53,005
I'm good.

246
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:54,940
-You should use the restroom.
-I went.

247
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:57,143
-You went? What about a drink?
-Yes.

248
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:58,344
-Are you okay?
-Wow.

249
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:01,080
-Let's go.
-Just once.

250
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:03,449
All right. For how many minutes?

251
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:04,717
Three minutes.

252
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:08,621
<i>Jinguji stops him,
and he finally takes a break.</i>

253
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,224
-He's amazing.
-He is.

254
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,998
<i>Kishi puts a lot of pressure on himself.</i>

255
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:23,102
<i>"If I cut corners, I won't make it."</i>

256
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:26,639
<i>He lives by those words.</i>

257
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,442
Let's redo it and fix what's difficult.

258
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:31,977
-Man...
-Okay.

259
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:40,219

<i>this year he is trying out
something new.</i>

-It's my first time, so...
-Right.

268
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:04,276
I'm nervous but I'll do my best.

-For this part...
-Yes?

Yes. You can laugh.

-That's no problem.
-Okay.

-It's okay.
-I'll try to make funny mistakes.

That's right.

-That's terrible!
-Sorry!

307
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:47,346
I know, I wasn't sure
when I should chime in.

308
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:48,247
It's so sudden.

309
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:50,783

How are you when you're in love?

312
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,088
It's not an interview!

313
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:58,657
I was just very curious.

314
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:00,893
I like his awkwardness.

315
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,794
Well,

316
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,429

317
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:06,265
<i>Right now, everything he does is training.</i>

318
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:09,268
"One hundred percent.

319
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:11,370
Yuta always gives one hundred percent."

320
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:16,175
I'm ending all of them with this phrase.

321
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:22,214
<i>The one who drew Kishi in his manga</i>

322
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:25,384
<i>was the youngest member,

00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:26,385
KAITO TAKAHASHI (20)

324
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,755
{\an8}<i>Last year, Takahashi</i>

325
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:34,026
{\an8}<i>participated in a project for aspiring
manga artists in a monthly magazine.</i>

326
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:37,830
{\an8}<i>This time,

00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:44,536
So dark.

330
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:46,405
He's so tanned now.

331
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,543
<i>The theme for his comic strip is...</i>

332
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:55,214
If an idol is going to draw it,

333
00:16:55,280 --> 00:17:01,153
I thought our fans would enjoy
reading about the daily life of an idol.

334
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:05,057
<i>An idol writing a manga series.</i>

335
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:07,026
<i>That made news</i>

336
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:10,195
<i>and attracted many interviewers
who came to the announcement.</i>

337
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:13,265
Can you hold up the print?

338
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:15,334

339
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:18,771
<i>For Takahashi,
this should be a happy event...</i>

340
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:21,940
The next story?

341
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:24,510
<i>But as they keep asking questions,</i>

342
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,079
<i>he is starting to look anxious.</i>

343
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,083
Already, from the first one,

344
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:34,520
they're talking about deadlines and stuff.

345
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:38,824
From here, because of our line of work,

346
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:41,293
we'll start getting
long-term jobs and such.

347
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,162
Whether that's theater

348
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,130
or tours...

349
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:49,835
When that happens, I'll probably have to

350
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:54,173
come home after a tiring day
of being on stage

351
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,475
and work on my manga without sleeping.

352
00:17:57,676 --> 00:18:01,580
When I think about that,
I'm so afraid of the future.

353
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:05,184
I didn't think I'd be doing a series.

354
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:09,054
But you know,
you are a professional manga artist.

355
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:14,526
Now, I have to work hard.

356
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,564
Today, I'm going to...

357
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,900
<i>Takahashi will end up facing a crisis</i>

358
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,636
<i>just a few days later.</i>

359
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:28,273
SHOGAKUKAN

360
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,709
<i>A few days after his new series
was announced...</i>

361
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:34,546
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

362
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,282
<i>Takahashi was again</i>

363
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:39,751
<i>at the publishing company
to work on his series.</i>

364
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:42,488
<i>He looks exhausted.</i>

365
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:43,922
Damn it...

366
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:47,226
-He hurt his back.
-What?

367
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,861
Yes...

368
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:50,762
He says it hurts in any position.

369
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:53,365
Is it a slipped disc?

370
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:55,667
-That's what they told me.
-Or fatigue?

371
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:02,875
<i>He said it just happened suddenly
while he was filming a show.</i>

372
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:10,916
A slipped disc at my age
is caused by tiredness and fatigue,

373
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:12,184
supposedly.

374
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:16,522
I was like, "Don't say I have
a slipped disc when I'm this young."

375
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:22,127
But my body has enough power
to heal in two to three days.

376
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:23,595
I'm a Johnny's member.

377
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:27,766
-Let's do this.
-Let's.

378
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:30,302
Five pages.

379
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:31,537
<i>By the end of today,</i>

380
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:36,341
<i>he must finish at least the rough drafts
of seven comic strips.</i>

381
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:38,810
<i>However...</i>

382
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,949
-On the right...
-Ouch.

383
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:47,319
Oh, no... I can't think at all.

384
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,690
What should I do...

385
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:57,162
<i>But the deadline will not wait for him.</i>

386
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:01,833
Damn, it really hurts.

387
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,036
I can't...

388
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,708
<i>There is both joy and pain</i>

389
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,743
<i>that comes from everyone's expectations.</i>

390
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,118
<i>While writhing in pain,</i>

391
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:21,720
<i>he keeps his pen moving.</i>

392
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,760
<i>And two hours later...</i>

393
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:33,865
I can't think of anything
for the last one.

394
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:36,301
The last one?

395
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,204
<i>Just a little more.</i>

396
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:45,577
<i>He is done.</i>

397
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:49,514
JULY 2019
TOKYO

398
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:50,582
<i>Then came July,</i>

399
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:54,152
<i>when they lost someone dear to them.</i>

400
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:03,428
<i>The five King & Prince members
are rehearsing with</i>

401
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:07,699
<i>their backup Johnny's Jr. dancers
for their new upcoming tour.</i>

402
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:17,042
Five, six, seven, eight...

403
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,444
<i>They're trying to
live up to the expectations</i>

404
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,281
<i>of the man who hated somber atmospheres.</i>

405
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:28,720
<i>On the next</i> Ride On Time<i>...</i>

406
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:30,722
{\an8}If we use white denim,

407
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:31,657
{\an8}the bottom can...

408
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:33,692
{\an8}<i>The members themselves build up</i>

409
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,560
{\an8}<i>the tour for their second year.</i>

410
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,630
{\an8}The audience here can't see very well.

411
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:41,066
{\an8}<i>During rehearsal,</i>

412
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,101
{\an8}<i>something happens to one member.</i>

413
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:45,070
{\an8}My foot hurts.

414
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,207
{\an8}<i>What's the reason why
they keep charging forward?</i>

415
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:53,445
{\an8}If we don't push ourselves past our limit,
it won't be a cool performance.

416
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:55,781
{\an8}<i>Right before showtime...</i>

417
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:57,816
{\an8}Is this the real speed?

418
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:03,288
{\an8}<i>The entertainment legacy gets passed down.</i>

419
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:08,627
<i>There, we'll see
a new side to King & Prince.</i>

420
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:10,862
