1
00:00:01,568 --> 00:00:03,236
Wait, I didn't have my mic on.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,972
-You have five minutes.
-Okay.

3
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:14,214
<i>It happened during the rehearsal.</i>

4
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:17,917
That day came suddenly.

5
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:32,065
<i>As he was singing a song,</i>

6
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,300
<i>Hirano suddenly began to cry.</i>

7
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:41,508
<i>What was the reason behind those tears?</i>

8
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:07,667
<i>This is documentary series</i> Ride On Time.

9
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:16,342
<i>Another stage play is
about to be born in this studio.</i>

10
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:20,580
<i>The ones to take center stage</i>

11
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:22,449
<i>are King & Prince.</i>

12
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:27,420
<i>The three members</i>

13
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:30,390
<i>who went by the name Mr. King
before they debuted.</i>

14
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:34,794
Can we try from the start?

15
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:37,997
{\an8}KAITO TAKAHASHI (20)

16
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:42,602
{\an8}<i>For these three, who are actively
appearing in movies, dramas, and TV shows,</i>

17
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:46,039
{\an8}<i>this stage play is an opportunity
to re-evaluate themselves.</i>

18
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:47,707
{\an8}SHO HIRANO (22)

19
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:49,042
Look at it.

20
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:50,844
There's so much to do.

21
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:52,545
We have to sing, dance,

22
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,147
and act.

23
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:59,252
<i>It is called JOHNNYS' IsLAND.</i>

24
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:05,191
<i>Their father-figure in this business</i>

25
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:08,094
<i>integrated all aspects
of entertainment into</i>

26
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:10,363
<i>this epic culmination of a stage play.</i>

27
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:14,934
<i>Not only that,</i>

28
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,737
<i>these three were left
with a massive assignment.</i>

29
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:23,810
<i>When he was alive,</i>

30
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:26,713
<i>he cherished these words
more than anything.</i>

31
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:32,152
{\an8}<i>To stand on stage</i>

32
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:34,087
{\an8}<i>no matter what happens.</i>

33
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,389
<i>"The real meaning behind these words..."</i>

34
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:39,058
<i>The theme of this stage play
is to reconsider</i>

35
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,027
<i>the meaning behind these words.</i>

36
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:44,964
-Mr. Johnny liked this spot?
-Yeah.

37
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:46,399
He'd watch rehearsals here.

38
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:51,037
Are you off-center? Are you okay?

39
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:52,605
This is better.

40
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:02,649
<i>What thoughts were imbued in those words?</i>

41
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,522
<i>November, 2019.</i>

42
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,594
<i>The opening day is just a month away</i>

43
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:16,729
<i>and rehearsals are in full swing.</i>

44
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,801
<i>Their first hurdle is the taiko drums.</i>

45
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:25,238
This will...

46
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:27,907
-delay one at a time.
-Okay.

47
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:34,914
<i>They must hit the drums
at slightly different times.</i>

48
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:38,451
<i>It requires a technique</i>

49
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:40,987
<i>completely different
from regular drumming.</i>

50
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,157
This is bad.

51
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:47,860
<i>Actually, these taiko drums</i>

52
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:51,197
<i>are a fusion of Japanese
and western styles,</i>

53
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:54,801
<i>and they must play along to
electronic music.</i>

54
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:01,908
-Can I listen to that again?
-I am completely lost.

55
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:05,078
It's the hardest thing I've done so far.

56
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:07,780
Because we're playing to digital sounds.

57
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:13,353
<i>They only have a few days
to practice the taiko.</i>

58
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,421
<i>They are all determined.</i>

59
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:17,890
Oh, no. My head is spinning.

60
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,026
Sorry!

61
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,395
One more time. From the start, please.

62
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:24,130
Can we try from the same place?

63
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:25,898
One, two, three, four.

64
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,336
<i>Repeating it over and over again.</i>

65
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:32,805
<i>That is Nagase's method.</i>

66
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:37,543
Everyone goes to sleep and wakes up
with the routine still memorized.

67
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,811
But I forget everything.

68
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:40,913
I have to repeat it, or I can't remember.

69
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,382
That's normal, though.

70
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:45,618
I'm just working on what I can't do.

71
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,553
Okay, let's do it.

72
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:54,594
<i>Today, Hirano is practicing the flying
routine, which he's done before.</i>

73
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:58,931
<i>He hangs inside a sphere</i>

74
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:00,533
<i>and completes the moves.</i>

75
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:05,872
<i>He is trying to grasp the feeling</i>

76
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:09,409
<i>of spinning in the air
as if he were swimming.</i>

77
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,979
That's rough first thing in the morning.

78
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:17,317
Your inner ears readjust.

79
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,319
Do they adjust in the first place?

80
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:20,687
They do.

81
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:22,021
They really do.

82
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:24,457
By the final performance,

83
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:26,426
you don't even get dizzy anymore.

84
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,995
If the audience sees this

85
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:31,931
and is impressed by it,

86
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,100
that will make me happy.

87
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,370
<i>Meanwhile, Takahashi...</i>

88
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,874
<i>is working on an important scene.</i>

89
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:47,647
What is the most important part?

90
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:50,283
Mr. Johnny spent a week
on these four lines.

91
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:53,219
-Seriously?
-Without changing it...

92
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:59,192
<i>He is earnestly contemplating
one word written in the script.</i>

93
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:02,462
<i>"War."</i>

94
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,733
-Big brother!
-It's an incendiary bomb!

95
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:13,039
<i>A fundamental part of this theater
is a scene that portrays war.</i>

96
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:17,510
I don't want them to experience
this tragedy!

97
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:24,517
<i>As someone who lived through the war,</i>

98
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:29,322
<i>he purposely had these youths,
who are aspiring to become idols,</i>

99
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,891
<i>face the tragic realities of life.</i>

100
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:37,697
Because that history is forgotten now,
he wants you to remember it and realize

101
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:41,534
your happiness is a product
of those hard times.

102
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:43,469
To not take it for granted.

103
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:47,073
Throw it whichever way you're facing.

104
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:52,545
As if you are throwing down
a bomb or grenade.

105
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:54,881
Boom, boom, boom.

106
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:59,285
<i>The scene leading up to that line
depicts the brutality of war.</i>

107
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:02,622
Use your hands in your own way,

108
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:04,557
to show that you're in pain

109
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:06,125
and writhing.

110
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:11,230
<i>He will portray that with dance.</i>

111
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:14,967
<i>Takahashi has given himself
a difficult task.</i>

112
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:17,970
It's not a school club.

113
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:22,608
This is my career and my livelihood,

114
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:25,978
so I feel a responsibility
to stand on stage.

115
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:28,548
It's our job to bring joy to people,

116
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:33,820
so I do think of it as my mission.

117
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,256
<i>For Takahashi,</i>

118
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:40,827
<i>that is what "show must go on"
means to him now.</i>

119
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:47,266
<i>Amidst practice,
the five of them come together.</i>

120
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:49,936
Very good.

121
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:51,537
Welcome!

122
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:56,542
<i>They're reliable teammates
who each have areas they excel in.</i>

123
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:02,081
<i>Hirano was still struggling with the taiko</i>

124
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:03,583
<i>and asked Kishi...</i>

125
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:07,253
The taiko is so fast this time.

126
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,254
Really?

127
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:09,989
Hey, Kishi.

128
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:13,459
Is there a word that fits in this rhythm?

129
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,394
Mammoth exhibition.

130
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,430
Mammoth exhibition?

131
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:22,201
Mammoth exhibition,
mammoth exhibition, okay, okay.

132
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:24,637
MAMMOTH EXHIBITION

133
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:25,705
It's hard to say.

134
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,209
{\an8}<i>Kishi and Jinguji,
who were asked for advice,</i>

135
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:33,513
{\an8}<i>also faced that theme
left by their dear friend</i>

136
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:34,914
{\an8}<i>through theater last year.</i>

137
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,388
{\an8}<i>A story about youths</i>

138
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:45,658
{\an8}<i>finding the meaning of life
through boxing.</i>

139
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:50,963
<i>There are things they know</i>

140
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,865
<i>now that they've done it.</i>

141
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:57,203
I was able to experience
the joy of theater all over again.

142
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:59,839
"Tomorrow is better than yesterday,"

143
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:01,007
is how I feel.

144
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:04,610
Our goal was to give a good performance,

145
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:07,113
so once it was done,

146
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,383
I felt glad that I worked hard,
and it was so much fun.

147
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:14,887
Everything comes back to you like that.

148
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:18,024
-Hello.
-Hello.

149
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:18,958
Nice to meet you.

150
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:20,893
<i>They have one week until opening day.</i>

151
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:25,164
<i>The three of them must learn
a difficult dance routine.</i>

152
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:30,336
Since it's the three of you,
we have three people as well.

153
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:36,342
<i>The song they'll be dancing to
is called "Chanbara."</i>

154
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:40,613
Boom. Then, repeat it. One, two, three...

155
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:46,953
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
Then spin around.

156
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:50,723
<i>Nagase is having some trouble.</i>

157
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,061
<i>Fifteen minutes into it...</i>

158
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:58,531
-Can we do one-on-one?
-Yeah.

159
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,367
-Not as a group. Can you teach me?
-Sure.

160
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,905
<i>Slowly but surely.</i>

161
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:08,274
<i>He makes sure each step is correct</i>

162
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,276
<i>and memorizes the moves.</i>

163
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,212
Five, six...

164
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:23,756
<i>And 30 minutes later.</i>

165
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:26,659
Let's slowly do it together.

166
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,094
The three of you.

167
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:39,505
Ren, if you turn a little more this way...

168
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:41,741
I see. I'm going straight.

169
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:45,277
I'm coming up from the back,
so I almost bump into you.

170
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:48,347
-Okay.
-Sorry.

171
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:49,882
When you move positions,

172
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:51,384
make your movements bigger.

173
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:54,820
Diagonally? Sorry about that.

174
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:57,323
Ready...

175
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,962
<i>No matter how hard it is,</i>

176
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,364
<i>they must find the answers on their own</i>

177
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:08,067
<i>and create something new.</i>

178
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,973
I think Mr. Johnny
purposely didn't explain

179
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,075
what "show must go on" meant.

180
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:19,178
He'd say, "show must go on,"
but he wouldn't go into detail.

181
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:23,249
We have to find the meaning ourselves
and make our own decisions.

182
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:26,752
As long as we have an audience,
we have to continue.

183
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,924
<i>Nagase continues to search
for the meaning of those words.</i>

184
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:35,394
IMPERIAL THEATRE

185
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:37,463
<i>It is opening day.</i>

186
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:40,666
<i>Rehearsals start in the afternoon</i>

187
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:42,034
<i>and showtime is at night.</i>

188
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:45,204
<i>Until then, they go through
and inspect each item</i>

189
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:47,440
<i>on their long checklist</i>

190
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:49,442
<i>and make their own decisions.</i>

191
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:55,081
The part that goes, "I can bet my life"
is the only time.

192
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:58,317
-That's one, right?
-That's one.

193
00:11:58,584 --> 00:11:59,919
It's one.

194
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:01,687
<i>Actually, this stage play</i>

195
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:05,257
<i>has a part that was kept a secret
even during rehearsals.</i>

196
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:13,365
<i>The starring members will speak
about their memories of him.</i>

197
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:14,300
KEEPSAKES ON STAGE

198
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:15,968
<i>There is no set script.</i>

199
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:19,038
<i>They will express their real feelings.</i>

200
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,476
OPEN REHEARSAL

201
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:26,946
<i>That scene was performed
during the open rehearsal.</i>

202
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:31,717
Look, you guys!

203
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:36,021
<i>A poster of the show
he attended until he passed.</i>

204
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:38,090
I was so nervous that day!

205
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,926
{\an8}When I see the scratches on it,
it reminds me...

206
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:43,529
{\an8}<i>Items they've practiced with
all this time...</i>

207
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:48,667
{\an8}<i>Those memorable items fill up the stage.</i>

208
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:51,270
{\an8}...he talked to me.

209
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,672
I gave him this vest for his birthday.

210
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:54,573
HIDAKA UKISHO

211
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,843
He wore it every day,
and that made me so happy.

212
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:00,579
The first time he heard me sing,

213
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,648
he said it was basic.

214
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:05,985
But he said I should try <i>enka</i>,

215
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:09,855
and when I did, he praised me so much.

216
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:10,890
TAISHO IWASAKI

217
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,658
I was so happy.

218
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,295
<i>Their feelings for him flow forth.</i>

219
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:19,064
<i>This was triggered by...</i>

220
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,203
<i>Hirano's performance of</i>

221
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:27,139
<i>the song expressing
a sense of emptiness</i>

222
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:28,474
<i>after losing someone dear.</i>

223
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,075
That day came suddenly.

224
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:38,951
{\an8}<i>When it slips out of my hands</i>

225
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:46,392
{\an8}<i>I realize for the first time</i>

226
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:53,599
{\an8}<i>The importance of what I lost</i>

227
00:13:54,133 --> 00:14:00,606
{\an8}<i>When it disappears from my heart</i>

228
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:08,547
<i>I realize I am lonely</i>

229
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:22,261
<i>The curtains will rise for opening day.</i>

230
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,437
Welcome to the dream stage,
JOHNNYS' IsLAND.

231
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:35,941
<i>It's the first time doing this show
since his death.</i>

232
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:45,784
<i>The Japanese taiko and electronic fusion
the three of them worked hard to create.</i>

233
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:56,061
<i>And "Chanbara,"
the dance Nagase had difficulties with.</i>

234
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:01,166
My favorite one out of
all of them is "Chanbara."

235
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,435
When I saw the dance for the first time,

236
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:05,471
I thought it was insanely difficult.

237
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:09,408
But once I tried it and memorized it,

238
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:11,911
it was so fun to do.

239
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:13,545
Like real dancing.

240
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:20,719
<i>The war scene, which Takahashi himself</i>

241
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:24,490
<i>choreographed and contemplated
to portray the script.</i>

242
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:34,233
Throughout history,
humans are always fighting.

243
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:38,404
This ordinary life is a blessing.

244
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:42,608
We need to...

245
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:45,811
count our blessings.

246
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:52,351
-Hello.
-Hello.

247
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,288
<i>These two have come to watch the show.</i>

248
00:15:56,555 --> 00:16:02,928
It feels strange to watch
JOHNNYS' IsLAND so objectively.

249
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:04,697
Oh, no.

250
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:06,265
I'm super excited.

251
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:08,267
Oh, no.

252
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:11,770
<i>Last year, Kishi and Jinguji
stood on the same stage.</i>

253
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:19,511
<i>How will it look to them?</i>

254
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,317
-That's amazing.
-It looks so real.

255
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,288
<i>What caught them by surprise</i>

256
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:33,525
<i>was the scene where they talk about
their fond memories of him.</i>

257
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:35,127
I don't really remember.

258
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,962
Back then...

259
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:39,965
<i>Takahashi knew the two of them
were watching.</i>

260
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:45,137
<i>He began to talk about
how their group formed their bond.</i>

261
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:51,410
He said, "You are going to be
Mr. King vs Mr. Prince from today."

262
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,246
It was our first group.

263
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,248
It gave us so much hope.

264
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:59,518
A lot happened,
and we separated for a bit,

265
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:02,588
but the next time we came together

266
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:04,857
was when we debuted.

267
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:10,863
To think that he believed in us
that whole time makes me happy.

268
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,465
Let's work hard from now on.

269
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:15,467
Yeah.

270
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:18,003
Let's work hard.

271
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:26,879
<i>They did not expect to witness
something like this.</i>

272
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:28,847
-...three of us.
-Everyone on Earth

273
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:30,549
was clapping right now.

274
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:33,385
<i>And the finale.</i>

275
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:37,990
<i>Overwhelmed with emotions,</i>

276
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,559
<i>the two of them run to the stage.</i>

277
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,698
Thank you! Have a safe trip home.

278
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:54,373
-How was it?
-I was so moved.

279
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:56,408
What moved you?

280
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:58,110
Your soul.

281
00:17:58,177 --> 00:17:59,912
Everyone's soul.

282
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:01,613
I got goosebumps so many times.

283
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,282
-You did? Really?
-I did.

284
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:08,454
<i>After seeing the stage play,</i>

285
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,789
<i>what is their take on "show must go on,"</i>

286
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,992
<i>a phrase taught
by the person so dear to them?</i>

287
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:18,464
Making people happy,

288
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:23,335
not creating negativity, and staying
positive no matter what happens

289
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:27,673
is what "show must go on" means.

290
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:31,043
In the future, for example...

291
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,313
there will always be
ups and downs in life,

292
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:37,282
but we have to charge forward
toward our dream,

293
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:39,785
and bring more happiness to people,

294
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:43,188
and ultimately just keep living life.

295
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:46,792
I think that phrase is a way of living.

296
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:52,331
{\an8}<i>And then it was New Year's Eve.</i>

297
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:53,999
{\an8}JOHNNY'S COUNTDOWN 2019-2020

298
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:58,904
{\an8}<i>They were faced with
a "show must go on" moment.</i>

299
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,008
{\an8}70TH NHK KOHAKU UTA GASSEN

300
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:07,079
{\an8}<i>It's the second New Year's Eve
since King & Prince was born.</i>

301
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:09,748
We talked about

302
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:13,919
changing it up for Kohaku. When Kaito
sings it, he sounds like Sukima Switch.

303
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,760
-He's going to mess up on stage.
-I know.

304
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,329
-We're ready.
-Thank you.

305
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:25,497
-Bye.
-Bye.

306
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:29,601
<i>They don't seem nervous
as they walk onto a prestigious stage.</i>

307
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:40,579
<i>King & Prince blasts through
their second year.</i>

308
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:50,522
<i>They continue to
push themselves to their limit.</i>

309
00:19:57,796 --> 00:20:00,499
<i>They know the importance of honest,
steady work.</i>

310
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:05,070
The audience here can't see very well.

311
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:10,008
<i>They look for new skills.</i>

312
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:14,046
I can't think at all.

313
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:15,781
Good evening! I'm...

314
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:18,984
<i>They work to widen their boundaries.</i>

315
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:21,720
Is that not allowed by my agency?

316
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:24,723
Radio is interesting, though.

317
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:30,862
<i>They make an earnest effort
to live as idols.</i>

318
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:42,808
{\an8}<i>They will continue on this journey.</i>

319
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,445
{\an8}Doing the shows are a sign

320
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:50,882
{\an8}of peace, and we can do the shows
because there is peace.

321
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,318
{\an8}That's what I think.

322
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:58,457
{\an8}And so, the "show must go on" in a sense
and we can't let that end.

323
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,027
Ready...

324
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,195
We have a mission!

325
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,162
CM SHOOTING

326
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,932
-Start.
-This is the best Puccho!

327
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:08,333
The one with gummies!

328
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:12,371
-Obviously, the balls are way better.
-Crunchy outside, soft inside!

329
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:14,740
Cut!

330
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:19,745
We're all heading toward the same goal

331
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:21,246
and working hard.

332
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:26,151
-We're trying to be serious.
-We're talking about our dreams.

333
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:27,986
How will they edit this?

334
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:30,889
-It'll get cut out, don't worry.
-I want them to use that.

335
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:34,159
<i>On the next</i> Ride on Time<i>...</i>

336
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,061
{\an8}STARTING FROM TOKYO DOME

337
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:39,531
{\an8}<i>A five-member unit
working toward their debut...</i>

338

{\an8}<i>HiHi Jets.</i>

339
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:44,469
<i>A documentary spanning eight months.</i>

<i>We follow them as they work hard</i>

341
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,676
<i>while experiencing setbacks and growth.</i>

342
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:51,643
You almost had it.

343
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:55,347
{\an8}<i>But they are faced with a huge trial.</i>

344
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:58,850
You have to come back. To the five of us.

345
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,085
I mean, three of us.

346
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:03,021
Each of us must become
someone who is needed,

347
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:06,325
so that we become needed
as a group as well.

348
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:08,560
That's the most important thing.

349
