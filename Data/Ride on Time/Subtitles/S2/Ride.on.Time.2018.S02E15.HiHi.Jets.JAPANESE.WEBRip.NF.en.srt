{\an8}<i>These boys have been confronted
by a predicament.</i>

3
00:00:10,643 --> 00:00:13,480
{\an8}<i>They're the idol unit, HiHi Jets.</i>

4
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:18,018
{\an8}<i>They're supposed to be a quintet,
but only three of them are here.</i>

5
00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:22,555
<i>What happened?</i>

6
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:28,161
I had to consider what I'd do

7
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:31,598
if the group couldn't go on anymore.
In case it went south.

8
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:32,866
What scares me most

9
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:35,168
is that the two of them
might not come back.

10
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:37,937
After us three have worked so hard.

11
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:40,340
A relationship of trust.

12
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:44,811
It's not a question of wanting to have it,
if we don't have it...

13

{\an8}<i>Ryuto Sakuma is a nimble skater who can
even perform repairs on the skates.</i>

27

{\an8}That's the color the new ones have.

28

35
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:42,262
I never know what to do with myself

65

<i>As you'd expect from such a big role,

Have you memorized it?

69

I've hardly got anywhere with it yet.

70

to give him some guidance today.</i>

71

{\an8}<i>It's Koichi Domoto, a reverential figure.</i>

72
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,138
Hello, Koichi.

73
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:13,379
"I don't know my parents. I was taken
to the home as soon as I was born.

But I wasn't lonely.

75
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:18,818
That's because I had Yuta,
who was like a big brother to me.

76
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,921
I call him 'Brother,'

77

As you were reading there,

79
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:30,563
-you kept rushing to get to the next line.
-Right.

80
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,933
You tend to say the first bit boldly,
but then trail off.

81
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,867
Right.

82
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:39,572
"I don't know my parents. I was taken
to the home as soon as I was born."

83
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:42,241
-You end up speaking like that.
-Right.

84
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:46,112
Try your best not to fade away at the end.

85
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:51,084

-You're too self-conscious now.
-Yes, sorry.

91
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:06,366
Nice and natural.

92
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:09,068
-"That's because I had Yuta."
-"That's because I had Yuta."

93
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:13,172
Let the audience absorb those words,
and then move on.

94
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:14,140
Yes.

95
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,409

97
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:33,326
Oh, man.

98
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:37,830
Koichi took the time
out of his busy schedule to be here,

99
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,968
and I hadn't even read the whole script...

100
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:45,705
I feel apologetic, I have to say.

101
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:50,076
Ultimately, we have to study.

102
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:54,714

00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,787
Please, stop it now!

170
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:34,493
<i>And then, the baton routine they kept
failing to get right in rehearsals.</i>

171
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:47,073
<i>They finish it
without dropping a single baton.</i>

172
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:50,676
Did you see us nail the batons?

173
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:55,414
It seems I'm a man
who's good on the night.

174
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:59,719
I'm just glad we made it
through the first night.

175
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:02,688
The Inoue Report... Shall I do that?

176
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:04,523
<i>They'd get through this, somehow.</i>

177
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:07,226
<i>Everyone was thinking that at this time.</i>

178
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:11,464
Can we talk to you, Sakuma?
Do you have a minute?

179
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:12,998
Sure.

180
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:15,468
<i>Crisis strikes.</i>

181
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:26,545
<i>Something Hashimoto and Sakuma have done
is seen as a problem.</i>

182
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:31,917
<i>Takahashi made this post on his blog.</i>

183
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:33,519
SEPTEMBER 11
HIHI JETS' BLOG

184
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,254
{\an8}WITHDRAWAL FROM ACTIVITY...

185
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:37,490
{\an8}<i>The pair will temporarily withdraw
from public life.</i>

186
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:41,927
<i>Since then,</i>

187
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:45,664
<i>HiHi Jets have been performing
as a trio on the show.</i>

188
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,708
Okay, let's do it here.

189
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:57,543
All right.

190
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:01,781
Has this pushed your debut further away?

191
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:05,584
Of course. I definitely think so.

192
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:11,123
I'm sure the audience paid their money
thinking they would see

193
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:14,059
all five HiHi Jets,
and made room in their calendars.

194
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,829
Then they traveled here to see us.

195
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,766
I feel so much regret about that.

196
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:26,005
If they decided to leave, I'd say that
they have to come back to the five of us,

197
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:27,439
or three, as we are now.

198
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:29,942
To be honest, if it wasn't for us five,

199
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:32,545
I don't think I'd be with this agency.

200
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:36,081
I've always thought that if HiHi
broke up, I'd quit.

201
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:37,950
So, if those two leave,

202
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:40,286
I'll go with them. I told them that.

203
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:45,057
Human beings may make mistakes,

204
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:48,561
but if you just leave it at that,

205
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:52,331
I don't think people can grow, either.

206
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:55,201
If you can't do your job with pride,

207
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:58,637
people won't accept you
in the first place.

208
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:00,906
They won't be able to like you.

209
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:05,477
Be someone people would want to see.

210
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,750
That's what you have to do.

211
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:15,154
It's not a question of wanting to have it.

212
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:16,722
If we don't have it...

213
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:22,628
I think it's over.

214
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:29,268
We can only do what we can right now.

215
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:36,976
{\an8}<i>November.</i>

216
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,811
{\an8}-Good morning.
-Good morning.

217
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:41,947
Cold, isn't it? I think I'm going to die.

218
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:47,086
<i>This is what the HiHi Jets trio are up to.</i>

219
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:49,221
I got up at 3:30 a.m.

220
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:50,890
When you fall forwards...

221
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:53,259
<i>Inoue is appearing in a movie.</i>

222
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:55,861
And, action!

223
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:59,064
It came off!

224
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:02,201
-No, it wasn't us!
-No, it wasn't us!

225
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:03,602
Cut!

226
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:05,604
No, it wasn't us!

227
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:09,575
<i>It's not a big part,
but he throws himself into it.</i>

228
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,082
{\an8}<i>Around the same time,
Takahashi is appearing in a TV drama.</i>

229
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:19,351
{\an8}DRAMA SERIAL W:
<i>KARERA WO MIREBA WAKARU KOTO</i>

230
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:21,120
I respected my father.

231
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:24,723
He was powerful.

232
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,960
A good communicator.

233
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:34,166
<i>Takahashi's plan is to make
acting his weapon.</i>

234
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,102
<i>He's developed his skill
a little more again.</i>

235
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,539
You don't need the script?

236
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,641
I don't have it on me much.

237
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,711
I memorize it before I start.

238
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:50,716
I master my lines at home.

239
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,652
That way, I'm not nervous here.

240
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,557
I make sure I practice enough

241
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:01,393
that I feel I can do it.

242
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:09,501
<i>There's still a way to go
until the other two members return.</i>

243
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:15,174
<i>Until then, all they can do
is better themselves and wait.</i>

244
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:24,650
<i>Having the fans there for him
keeps Igari going.</i>

245
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:28,787
All of the letters, more or less,

246
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:33,225
are kind words.
Sometimes people are harsh, too.

247
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:36,228
I suppose you remember
who your first fan was?

248
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:40,466
I do. Although it's more the first letter
that I remember, as opposed to the fan.

249
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:43,535
I remember that
it was in a light-blue envelope.

250
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,708
<i>It's been three months
since the two members left.</i>

251
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:54,580
<i>Takahashi and Inoue</i>

252
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:57,483
<i>have resumed their roller skate lessons.</i>

253
00:16:57,716 --> 00:16:59,084
And, go.

254
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:03,756
Ouch!

255
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:07,826
Careful!

256
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,530
Keep going!

257
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:19,538
All right!

258
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:20,539
Almost!

259
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:22,574
Dammit!

260
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:24,810
That hurt...

261
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:29,448
Damn! I like it, that's the spirit.

262
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:31,950
{\an8}DECEMBER 8, 2019
IMPERIAL THEATRE

263
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:33,819
{\an8}<i>Then December comes around.</i>

264
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,355
{\an8}<i>Another new show has begun.</i>

265
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:39,892
Okay, line up behind your number.

266
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:45,831
<i>While other groups are performing
with all their members,</i>

267
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,901
<i>HiHi Jets are a trio.</i>

268
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,180
<i>Two members have withdrawn
from public life.</i>

269
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:06,085
<i>What feelings has this time
stirred in them?</i>

270
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,526
As we keep evolving,

271
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:17,796
and we can all perform together again,

272
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:21,100
not only will those two level up,
but so will the whole group.

273
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:27,172
We'll be a higher-level group overall.
That's what I believe right now.

274
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,142
As I keep going.

275
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:31,910
Well, you know...

276
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:37,983
we'll be able to get along great.
I really feel that quite strongly.

277
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:42,488
In ten years' time,
even in several decades' time,

278
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:46,725
if the five of us can laugh
and have a good time together,

279
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:50,629
I think that will be enough for me.

280
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,535
<i>And then, January.</i>

281
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:59,104
<i>The withdrawal period is over,</i>

282
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:02,841
<i>and they're once again operating
as a five-man group.</i>

283
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:05,477
{\an8}JANUARY 6, 2020

284
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:08,447
{\an8}<i>It's the 118th day since withdrawal began.</i>

285
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:09,348
{\an8}Good morning!

286
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:13,118
Thank you for allowing the five of us
to do our shoot today.

287
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:14,253
Thank you!

288
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,654
Sorry to disturb you.

289
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:16,822
Please excuse us.

290
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:20,325
<i>For the first time in a long while,
the five are doing a photo shoot.</i>

291
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:26,265
<i>What they've lost won't come back easily.</i>

292
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:30,636
<i>They'll continue to be confronted
with the weight of the situation.</i>

293
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:36,375
<i>This is a path that they have chosen.</i>

294
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,912
That was hilarious!

295
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:44,850
Again!

296
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:45,784
Sit.

297
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:47,319
Whoa!

298
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:48,387
<i>That's because...</i>

299
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:52,524
<i>these five are HiHi Jets.</i>

300
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:59,698
How was everyone? Really good.
They got really mad!

301
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:01,066
But...

302
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:04,836
I'm grateful for them getting mad.

303
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:08,207
I'm grateful they didn't give up on me.

304
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:14,046
<i>As for Sakuma,</i>

305
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:18,750
<i>he took up the piano again in reclusion
after having given it up.</i>

306
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:26,858
<i>Apparently he was practicing
so he could be useful to the group.</i>

307
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:33,832
I decided to dedicate my life
to the group,

308
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,634
and I haven't forgotten that.

309
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:39,638
I've decided to fully make
the group's dreams

310
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:43,976
my own dreams.

311
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:47,613
<i>Over this period,</i>

312
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:51,016
<i>Takahashi was pursued continuously
by the same thought.</i>

313
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:57,389
How did we do this
when there were five of us?

314
00:20:57,456 --> 00:20:59,558
I started feeling that way
halfway through.

315
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:04,896
That scared me so much,
and there was nothing I could do.

316
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:08,767
{\an8}So, having this feeling after so long

317
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:11,503
{\an8}makes me happy.

318
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:17,376
{\an8}That was funny, wasn't it?

319
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:20,178
{\an8}<i>Their dream is to be a legendary group.</i>

320
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:23,248
{\an8}<i>The road to get there
is long and treacherous,</i>

321
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:26,952
{\an8}<i>but they've set out on it once more.</i>

322
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:34,192
{\an8}<i>On the next</i> Ride On Time<i>,</i>

323
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,395
{\an8}<i>Kis-My-Ft2.</i>

324
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:43,568
<i>Cameras follow them
through a turbulent 180 days.</i>

325
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,973
That was scary.

326
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:51,610
Everyone in Kis-My-Ft2
is getting to the 30 mark.

327
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:55,547
<i>Never seen on the stage,
we see what reality is</i>

328
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:56,848
<i>for the seven of them.</i>

329
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:02,020
If I thought about myself too much...

330
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:05,157
I'd fall apart.

331
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,958
{\an8}<i>And then...</i>

332
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:07,859
{\an8}TAIWAN

333
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:09,361
{\an8}<i>...they take to the world stage.</i>

334
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:12,431
<i>No matter where I am in the world,
I want to stand there</i>

335
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,199
and show people what Kis-My is all about.
