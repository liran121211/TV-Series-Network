1
00:00:01,768 --> 00:00:03,937
Ow!

2
00:00:05,305 --> 00:00:07,874
<i>These six band members
are fighting over choreography positions.</i>

3
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:10,477
<i>It's as if this is a club activity.</i>

4
00:00:10,543 --> 00:00:11,945
Can you scooch down more?

5
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,780
Knock it off! I'll do it myself!

6
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:16,116
Enough! It hurts!

7
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:18,218
This is how we roll.

8
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:20,720
We'll carry on like this
for about ten minutes.

9
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:23,990
<i>Who are these six
mischievous free-spirits?</i>

10
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,561
{\an8}<i>They are SixTONES.</i>

11
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:36,102
{\an8}<i>They are a Johnny's Jr. boy band</i>

12
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:40,106
{\an8}<i>and the first Japanese band to be
chosen for a YouTube artist promotion.</i>

13
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,016
{\an8}<i>The music video created for this campaign</i>

14
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:53,987
{\an8}<i>gained ten million views
in just ten months.</i>

15
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:57,557
{\an8}<i>They were called the new generation
who would unleash Johnny's stars</i>

16
00:00:57,624 --> 00:00:58,825
{\an8}<i>onto digital platforms.</i>

17
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:13,673
<i>Their performance is provocative
and unlike that of conventional idols.</i>

18
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,209
<i>They have stirred up a commotion.</i>

19
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,822
<i>With a rock-solid performance
and fan base,</i>

20
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:32,225
<i>SixTONES have been rumored to be
the next in line to make a CD debut.</i>

21
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:34,961
<i>How do they feel about this?</i>

22
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:41,401
People keep saying it's our turn soon,
but it's been 13 years already.

23
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:42,702
It's our 14th year now.

24
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,738
-Are they sure about this?
-Eh?

25
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:49,909
Will the audience be satisfied
just seeing us?

26
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,412
Don't they want to see
Sho Hirano standing here?

27
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:57,317
<i>This was their tone
before their debut was announced.</i>

28
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,888
<i>August 8.</i>

29
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:04,224
<i>The time has finally arrived.</i>

30
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:07,393
We have an announcement to make.

31
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:12,232
DOUBLE CD DEBUT!!

32
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:15,168
<i>They are going to make a CD debut in 2020</i>

33
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:18,738
<i>alongside their peer Johnny's Jr. unit,
Snow Man.</i>

34
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:25,011
This is the news
we wanted to share with you.

35
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:29,782
<i>It has been a long road for them.</i>

36
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:36,923
-Third sequence!
-Okay!

37
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:41,060
<i>From before their debut was decided
to when they announce it to their fans...</i>

38
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:47,267
{\an8}<i>We follow the members
for those eight months.</i>

39
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:50,103
{\an8}Is this an S?

40
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,894
<i>This is documentary series</i> Ride On Time.

41
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:21,234
{\an8}<i>May 1, 2020.
It is the beginning of the Reiwa era.</i>

42
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:25,805
{\an8}<i>Fifteen thousand fans have gathered
in the rain to see SixTONES.</i>

43
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:30,476
Good morning.

44
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:31,978
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

45
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:32,979
Hi.

46
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:39,052
<i>They have never had a solo show
in Osaka-jo Hall before.</i>

47
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:44,123
<i>On this date four years ago,
SixTONES was formed.</i>

48
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:52,165
Who'd have thought we'd come this far?

49
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,367
-I did.
-Liar.

50
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:57,704
I thought in four years,
we'd be performing in domes.

51
00:03:58,104 --> 00:03:59,872
You're so greedy.

52
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:01,541
We haven't gotten there yet.

53
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,309
I'm biracial.

54
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:06,679
We've always performed here
as backup dancers.

55
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,081
That's right.

56
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:11,851
All of Johnny's Jr. gathered here
to perform last year.

57
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,554
We've never performed here solo.

58
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:18,858
When I came in here today,
I got emotional.

59
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,728
-It's going to be just us.
-I know.

60
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:24,397
This is our first time as headliners.

61
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:29,769
<i>The members have been performing
as backup dancers all these years.</i>

62
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:34,173
<i>The fans' support has made it possible
for them to have a solo show.</i>

63
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:39,245
<i>Today is a special day.</i>

64
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:43,883
<i>SixTONES will be performing live
in Osaka-jo Hall today.</i>

65
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,451
<i>Today is our anniversary.</i>

66
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:47,754
See? I nailed it.

67
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,524
See how it's hard to tell
if it's a reflection or not?

68
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:55,662
<i>Each member has a unique personality.</i>

69
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:58,264
It's hilarious.

70
00:04:58,331 --> 00:04:59,666
Rassun Gorerai.

71
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:03,169
{\an8}<i>SixTONES' main vocalist
is always upbeat and cheerful.</i>

72
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:04,370
<i>Jesse.</i>

73
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:05,838
JESSE (22)

74
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:07,173
Beam!

75
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:09,909
{\an8}-How was today?
-It was fun.

76
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:13,479
{\an8}<i>Shintaro Morimoto is the youngest
and the mood-maker of the group.</i>

77
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:14,614
{\an8}SHINTARO MORIMOTO (21)

78
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:17,016
{\an8}Have you ever met anyone like us before?

79
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,185
{\an8}I want to see him.

80
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:22,255
{\an8}<i>Intelligent and calm,
Hokuto Matsumura is the brains.</i>

81
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,389
{\an8}HOKUTO MATSUMURA (23)

82
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:24,557
{\an8}It's not turning on.

83
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:26,993
{\an8}I think it's broken.

84
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,495
{\an8}I can't afford a new one.

85
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:32,832
{\an8}You're telling me now?

86
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:37,370
{\an8}<i>The eldest, but most made fun of
by others, Yugo Kochi.</i>

87
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:38,438
{\an8}YUGO KOCHI (25)

88
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:43,910
{\an8}<i>Taiga Kyomoto is the main vocal
alongside Jesse.</i>

89
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:47,714
{\an8}-Is that gratin?
-Avocado sausage gratin.

90
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:50,350
Isn't the name alone tempting?

91
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,185
-Totally.
-This is good.

92
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:54,354
Please watch.

93
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:59,425
{\an8}<i>And the central link
that binds the members together</i>

94
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:01,694
{\an8}<i>is the unit's MC, Juri Tanaka.</i>

95
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:03,363
{\an8}JURI TANAKA (23)

96
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:07,367
<i>All six members have been working hard</i>

97
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:09,869
<i>at Johnny's Jr. for over a decade.</i>

98
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:13,840
Do you do your own hair and makeup?

99
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:14,974
We do.

100
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:18,344
We can hire hair and makeup artists
if we want to.

101
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:20,413
Liar. We can't afford it.

102
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,614
Yeah, we can't.

103
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:25,718
Juniors always have to
do their own hair and makeup.

104
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:28,621
You need to get famous
to ask a professional.

105
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,960
Do you style it the way you like?

106
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:35,194
Yes.

107
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:39,499
Do you get nervous before going on stage?

108
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:40,633
No.

109
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,402
Wait, yes. I do.

110
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:47,240
Of course I'm nervous,
but not so much that I get anxious.

111
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:50,042
I was nervous on the first day
at Yokohama Arena.

112
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:52,412
But you see,

113
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:56,149
I understand how lucky we are
to perform in front of our fans.

114
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:57,984
It's such a blessing.

115
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:03,189
For SixTONES,
our fans are like our agents.

116
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:06,292
So many gigs were brought to us
by our fans.

117
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:10,196
We were chosen
for the YouTube artist promo campaign

118
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,465
because we got many views.

119
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:14,434
We're nothing without our fans.

120
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:19,238
We wouldn't have our gigs today
if it weren't for them.

121
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,974
Our first show in Osaka.

122
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,776
Can you stop making it special?

123
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:25,611
-Let's stop.
-I don't like it.

124
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:27,847
It's just another day for us.

125
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:30,450
Our next stage just happens
to be in Osaka.

126
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:31,350
True that.

127
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:34,854
<i>Whether it's the first day of Reiwa
or their anniversary,</i>

128
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:36,088
<i>it makes no difference.</i>

129
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:39,725
<i>They always want to deliver their best
for their fans at each show.</i>

130
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,356
Hello? Can I have a squid?

131
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:12,024
Yes, Zanmai TV!

132
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:16,062
<i>The crowd loves their MC.</i>

133
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:33,112
{\an8}<i>SixTONES have rock-solid skills
and popularity.</i>

134
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,549
{\an8}<i>The fans are looking forward to
their CD debut.</i>

135
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:39,452
<i>However, their feelings were wavering.</i>

136
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:49,228
<i>Today is SixTONES' anniversary.</i>

137
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:51,063
<i>The fans have been buzzing</i>

138
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,667
<i>about how their CD debut
could be announced on this stage.</i>

139
00:08:57,803 --> 00:09:03,042
<i>However, the members have mixed feelings
about this matter.</i>

140
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:07,680
Despite our image, we're not that young.

141
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:08,748
Nope.

142
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:11,217
HOKUTO MATSUMURA (23)

143
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:12,318
Yeah.

144
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:16,022
We hope we're late bloomers.

145
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:20,459
We're in the midst of our final chance.

146
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:26,766
Do you feel you've been kept waiting
for a long time?

147
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,502
It's not a big deal.

148
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,139
Let's see...

149
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,378
Perhaps it depends
on where you set your goal.

150
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:42,214
{\an8}Yes, it's important
that we have a CD debut.

151
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:43,449
{\an8}SHINTARO MORIMOTO (21)

152
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:47,253
{\an8}But that's not our goal.

153
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,089
It doesn't matter how long it takes.

154
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:54,460
You have to keep your eye on the prize.

155
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:55,828
It's like a marathon.

156
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:02,868
When I think about it,
it gets me down a bit.

157
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,674
Well, they...

158
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:14,614
they always ask us how we feel about it
in magazine interviews.

159
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,781
But...

160
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:21,253
I never know what to say.

161
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:27,960
Hokuto and Kochi almost had a CD debut.

162
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:32,598
We came close,
but we weren't quite good enough.

163
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:34,467
Not quite.

164
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:37,036
But you got to be in SixTONES.

165
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:38,337
Yeah.

166
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,539
Looking back, I can see why.

167
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:41,741
Now, you're free.

168
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:48,814
I can only imagine the stress
that we would have been put under.

169
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:50,216
Yeah.

170
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,986
Life can be funny that way.

171
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:56,122
You're right.

172
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:57,189
JESSE (22)

173
00:10:57,256 --> 00:11:01,761
We never thought
that things would turn out this way.

174
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:02,728
No.

175
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:07,199
This is the outcome
of taking each day at a time.

176
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,901
I couldn't be happier.

177
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:13,706
Pineapple, mango and strawberry.

178
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:15,207
Is matcha strawberry any good?

179
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:16,475
I―

180
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:17,910
-Yeah, Juri?
-I want pineapple.

181
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:18,978
Nice choice.

182
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:21,180
<i>The members do not get hung up
on the debut,</i>

183
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:24,550
<i>and instead focus on doing their best
at the task that is before them.</i>

184
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:28,654
Strawberry, grape, watermelon...

185
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:30,423
Muskmelon. Melon!

We'll have the narrator talk over that.

195

Do you want a shot like this?

196
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:57,616
Like, "We're gonna do this!"

197
00:11:57,683 --> 00:11:58,751
-Not really.
-No?

198
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:01,087

Ouch!

<i>They must challenge new genres

224
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:26,572
<i>They have learned from their seniors
how important it is to find a strength.</i>

225
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:32,077
Do you hope to increase the number
of gigs you do on your own?

226
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,814
Yes. I think it's important to do so.

227
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,750
With SixTONES,

228
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:42,288
we're not looking
to become champions in a team sport.

229
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:47,793
We want to be a group of individuals

230
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,263
who are each champions
of different genres.

231
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,099
So, I want to do my best doing gigs alone.

232
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:57,436
Then, I will take back what I achieve

233
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,905
to share with SixTONES.

234
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:06,011

<i>Kyomoto has a laid-back personality,</i>

240
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:46,552
<i>but he is uncompromising on himself
as a professional.</i>

241
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:49,922
-May I see?
-Of course.

242
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:54,326
I recently dyed my hair black.
I wanted to check how it's photographed.

243
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,196
This is my first shoot with it.

244
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:08,073
-I saw you checking the photos.
-Yeah.

245
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,643
Do you always check
how your photos turn out?

246
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:14,179
I usually don't,
but I'm not used to having hair this dark.

247
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:19,485
Your hair color really makes a difference
in photos.

248
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,021
When it's lighter,
I leave a cheerful impression.

249
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:25,424
When it's dark, I look cold.

250
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:27,726
I have to be honest.

251
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:32,197
As you can tell from the way I dress,

252
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:36,602
I have no interest in fashion or beauty.

253
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:39,738
Not at all.

254
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:44,276
I want to shave off my hair,
so I don't have to dry it.

255
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:51,283
But if I shaved off my hair,
I'd only have few fans left.

256
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:58,190
<i>Taiga was scouted in 2006
when he was 11 years old.</i>

257
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:01,393
<i>He was a shy boy,</i>

258
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,229
<i>but stayed in Johnny's
because he liked to sing.</i>

{\an8}SIXTONES FORMED IN 2015

260

{\an8}<i>He hopes to reach stardom
with his fellow members.</i>

262
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:20,012
When people think of Johnny's,

263
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:25,451
there'll be a group name
that pops into mind, like ARASHI.

264
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:30,622
I hope one day it will be SixTONES.

265
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:36,195
I want to make that happen.

266
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:39,064
We're never quite a unified team.

267
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:43,102
We dance differently.
We have different strengths.

268
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:45,237
Our appeals are different.

269
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:48,207
We need to use that to our advantage.

270
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:53,979
I want each of us
to develop our strengths.

271
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:57,082
I think we agree on one thing.

272
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:00,886
We are traveling together

273
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,557
to each make our dreams come true.

Yes.

288
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:06,218
Sure.

289
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:10,722
{\an8}I want more explosion in the first chorus.

290
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:11,657
Got it.

291

<i>The director grilled him

<i>That experience is now Taiga's strength.</i>

293
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:26,405
This is a career I want to pursue
in addition to SixTONES.

294
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:31,110
I've found my passion here.

<i>He is surprisingly calm

297

How far away do you think your debut is?

298
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:57,035
I―

299
00:18:57,102 --> 00:19:01,273
How far in the future does it feel to you?

300
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:05,777
I try not to think about how long
it will be until we make a CD debut.

301
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:08,814
It's my 14th year now.

302
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,952
There have been a few chances
for a debut in the past.

303
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:17,289
It was rumored we'd debut,
but when they announced the names,

304
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:19,491
ours were not included.

305
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:22,361
It's happened a few times already.

306
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,331
Here I still am today.

307
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:30,936
The moment you think
that it's your turn next,

308
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,504
your chance slips away.

309
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:36,808
The moment you think
you're ready to debut,

310
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:41,446
the god of fortune thinks you're cocky.

311
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,815
Then, Fortune looks the other way.

312
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:46,885
Let me be honest.

313
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,057
I don't want to debut.

314
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:53,892
I...

315
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,795
Um...

316
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:01,266
I'm scared of being asked
for something different.

317
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:06,672
I'm scared of us turning
into someone unfamiliar.

318
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:13,545
But, every time we've run into a wall,

319
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:17,015
the six of us have worked it out together.

320
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:22,521
If three, or four,
or five of us want to debut,

321
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:27,926
I'm in for the ride.

322
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:32,564
Yeah.

<i>What change awaits them beyond?</i>

325
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:53,118
<i>Perhaps if these six journey together
on this path...</i>

326
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:58,557
<i>they will reach newfound territory.</i>

327
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,929

329
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:09,968
{\an8}<i>Finally,

330
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:14,439
{\an8}Congratulations! Smile at the camera!

331
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:18,577
{\an8}<i>What is going through their minds
behind the hype?</i>

332
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:23,615
{\an8}I feel like SixTONES has gotten so big,

333
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:26,051
{\an8}and I am being left behind.

334
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:30,122
