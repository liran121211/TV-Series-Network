169
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:28,193
<i>Kisumai will perform on this show
for the first time.</i>

170
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:32,665
Whoa! You're sweating so much.

171
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:37,036
We did rehearsals for the song
and MC just a while ago.

172
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:40,105
We'll bring our best to the stage.

173
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:44,143
<i>What do the members think of themselves?</i>

174
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:51,884
We're not a typical Johnny's group

175
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:56,355
where every member
looks like Prince Charming.

176
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,525
We're all a little weird.

177
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:01,493
We're weirdos.

178
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,996
It's good that we're all different.

179
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:08,334
-I'm sweating like a pig.
-You are.

180
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:10,970
I was so nervous.

181
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:14,606
<i>They are neither typical nor princely.</i>

182
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:17,776
<i>They are just seven weirdos traveling
on this journey together.</i>

183
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:22,748
{\an8}Three, two, one!

184
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,917
{\an8}JOHNNY'S COUNTDOWN 2019-2020

185
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:28,988
{\an8}<i>It will be ten years
since their CD debut in 2020.</i>

186
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:44,069
{\an8}<i>The seven members lead on the front line</i>

187
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:47,706
{\an8}<i>while still searching
for a newer version of themselves.</i>

188
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:03,322
{\an8}-What? No way!
-You're kidding?

189
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:04,590
{\an8}Is this for real?

190
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:07,426
-Seriously?
-Yes!

191
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:09,361
{\an8}THE NETHER, STAGE PLAY

192
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,230
{\an8}<i>Hiromitsu Kitayama.</i>

193
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:19,304
I want to know
that I've at least given it a shot.

194
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:22,408
Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to stand it.

195
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:26,211
{\an8}Yes!

196
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:27,980
{\an8}<i>Taisuke Fujigaya.</i>

197
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,081
{\an8}DON JUAN, MUSICAL

198
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:31,250
{\an8}Thank you so much!

199
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:46,665
<i>At the end of the run,
there were tears in his eyes.</i>

200
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:51,136
I was scared.

201
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:54,540
But I had faith.

202
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:58,911
I'm glad I didn't run from this challenge.

203
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:01,180
{\an8}STAGE PLAY
<i>MARUMARU NA HITO NO MATSURO</i>

204
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:04,650
{\an8}<i>They each tackled difficult challenges.</i>

205
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,387
Yes.

206
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:11,957
<i>Toshiya Miyata.</i>

207
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,461
You two will make a great couple.

208
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:17,830
<i>Takashi Nikaido.</i>

209
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:19,498
Do you really think so?

210
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:21,867
Yeah, I do.

211
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:24,503
Here I am!

212
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:27,005
<i>Wataru Yokoo.</i>

213
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:30,008
Say it again.

214
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:31,009
Okay.

215
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:32,511
What? Really?

216
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:35,948
Yes. I had a busy day. I'm tired.

217
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:37,583
<i>Kento Senga.</i>

218
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:43,021
He's had it rough, living alone
with his brother since he turned 17.

219
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:47,759
A person like me
doesn't deserve happiness.

220
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:50,429
-Don't be stupid.
-Come on!

221
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:56,201
<i>Through this play,
these members pondered</i>

222
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:59,671
<i>what it means to tackle new challenges.</i>

223
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:10,849
I want something that I am the best at.

224
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:14,786
To be second to none in that genre.

225
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:17,723
If all seven members can accomplish that,

226
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:22,528
maybe we can become stars.

227
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:29,234
That's what I believe.

228
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:33,572
I get to do these gigs

229
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:36,241
thanks to the other six members.

230
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:39,511
I can't do anything alone.

231
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:44,550
Sometimes we may not all see eye to eye.

232
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:46,351
That happens.

233
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:50,222
But our strength lies
in us sticking together.

234
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:53,992
We are weak if we lose even one member.

235
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:59,331
Maybe someday, one of us will want to

236
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:02,134
try things on their own.

237
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:07,339
But I want us to stick together forever.

238
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:13,845
Even when we grow old and become old men,

239
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:16,448
I want us to stick together and be tight.

240
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,484
That's my dream.

241
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,787
{\an8}You're still cooking lame food?

242
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:27,192
{\an8}<i>Yuta Tamamori is the front man of Kisumai.</i>

243
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:34,399
Miyu is so disappointed in you.

244
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:37,035
I bet.

245
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:40,372
I don't want others to do what we do.

246
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:44,776
I don't want them to go crazy
on TV shows like we do.

247
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:50,315
I want people to be shocked
by what we are capable of.

248
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:57,022
That's my goal for us.

249
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:07,132
{\an8}<i>Idol group, Kis-My-Ft2.</i>

250
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:15,874
{\an8}<i>They aspire to be more crowd-shocking
than any other idol groups.</i>

251
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:26,051
{\an8}<i>Their journey has just begun.</i>

252
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:34,726
{\an8}<i>Next episode, we follow Koichi Domoto.</i>

253
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,261
{\an8}KOICHI DOMOTO

254
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:41,400
{\an8}Endless SHOCK <i>is reaching
its 20th anniversary.</i>

255
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:47,072
<i>He has fostered this musical
as the chairman and director.</i>

256
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:54,413
If there ever comes a time when I retire,

257
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:58,350
would the musical <i>SHOCK</i> also end with me?

258
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:01,420
If so, what have I been doing this for?

259
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:08,393
<i>What has he been thinking
behind the spotlight all these years?</i>

260
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,867
