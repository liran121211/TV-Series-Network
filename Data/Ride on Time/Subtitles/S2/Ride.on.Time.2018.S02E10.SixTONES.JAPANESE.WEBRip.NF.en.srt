00:00:01,434 --> 00:00:04,871
{\an8}Let me introduce us to the audience.

2
00:00:04,938 --> 00:00:05,872
{\an8}Yes, please.

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:10,477
{\an8}We are a unit within Johnny's Jr.
that is made up of Jr. members.

4
00:00:10,543 --> 00:00:14,147
{\an8}Our name is SixTONES,
and we have six members.

5
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:15,815
Our name is written "SixTONES."

6
00:00:15,882 --> 00:00:19,386
It means there are six different tones
in the group.

7
00:00:19,652 --> 00:00:22,922
Mr. Johnny gave us this name,

8
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:26,960
hoping that we would become a group where
each of our individualities would shine.

9
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,596
-Very nice.
-Well done.

10
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:32,065
"What is your dream for SixTONES?"

11
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:34,167
-What?
-Huh?

12
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:35,668
Wait, hang on.

13
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:39,672
<i>Even their answers are unique.</i>

14
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:41,674
Ready? One, two.

15
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:42,575
{\an8}-World best.
-National idol.

16
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:43,309
{\an8}-Big.
-Super famous.

17
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:44,077
{\an8}-Superstar.
-Popular.

18
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:08,401
<i>This is documentary series</i> Ride On Time.

19
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:11,638
SHIBUYA

20
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:15,308
<i>It is May and Johnny's Jr. is gaining
more momentum than ever.</i>

21
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:22,582
{\an8}<i>A store that sells only Johnny's Jr.
merchandise has opened in Shibuya, Tokyo.</i>

22
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:31,124
Whoa.

23
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:32,625
{\an8}Hi there.

24
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:33,560
{\an8}JURI TANAKA (23)

25
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,395
{\an8}This is incredible.

26
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:37,330
{\an8}I can't believe it.

27
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:40,366
This is a prime location.

28
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:44,137
Men and women of all ages

29
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:47,707
pass through this building.

30
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,477
{\an8}I've never seen us displayed

31
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:53,313
{\an8}in showcases like this before.

32
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:54,614
{\an8}JESSE (22)

33
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:56,216
This is my recommendation.

34
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:58,885
Please buy it. Please.

35
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,621
<i>Jesse is the main vocalist of SixTONES.</i>

36
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:04,524
SEPTEMBER 2006

37
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:07,560
<i>He joined Johnny's in 2006,
when he was nine years old.</i>

38
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:11,664
<i>He has an American father
and a Japanese mother.</i>

39
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:20,673
{\an8}<i>When SixTONES was formed in 2015,
Jesse was chosen as a member.</i>

40
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,378
I'm not good with communication.

41
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:27,881
I'm especially not good
at speaking Japanese.

42
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:31,184
That's why I want to put it into lyrics.

43
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:36,289
I want to make it into a song
and make it a piece of art.

44
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:38,024
It helps me feel less shy.

45
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:43,129
Music has given me a lot of freedom
as a medium to convey my feelings.

46
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:46,366
That's why I love music so much.

47
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:51,004
{\an8}Most people think of Johnny's Jr...

48
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:58,144
{\an8}as a bunch of backup dancers.

49
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:01,514
But being on YouTube changed things.

50
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:03,816
It lead to us being on <i>Kansai Collection</i>.

51
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:08,922
Being a Jr. has allowed us to do gigs

52
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:13,293
that our seniors couldn't do.

53
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:16,429
CD debut?

54
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:20,466
Without a CD debut,
I feel deprived of recognition.

55
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:22,035
Somehow.

56
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:26,306
-Your songs would be done at karaoke.
-I know, right?

57
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,408
I often go out to sing karaoke,

58
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:30,777
and friends ask me to sing my song there.

59
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:33,012
I'm like, "Sure... Wait, it's not here!"

60
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:35,081
"Sorry. Too bad."

61
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:39,419
People keep saying it's our turn soon,
but it's been 13 years already.

62
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:40,787
It's my 14th year.

63
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:44,757
Thanks to my cheerful personality,
we can joke about it.

64
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:48,628
I wonder what's going to happen to us.

65
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:56,970
<i>Though SixTONES has not made a CD debut,</i>

66
00:03:57,036 --> 00:04:00,373
<i>they perform songs at live shows
and on streaming channels.</i>

67
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:12,518
<i>They already have ten original songs.</i>

68
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:17,190
<i>Their activities are no different
from groups that have made their debut.</i>

69
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:22,395
<i>The only difference is that
they haven't released a CD yet.</i>

70
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:28,334
-This is perfect for karaoke.
-Totally.

71
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:30,003
I wish they'd add it.

72
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:33,506
I want to debut so we can release CDs.

73
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:34,540
You should just do it.

74
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:37,277
We should go ahead and do it
behind their backs.

75
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:38,478
Let's just do it.

76
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:40,480
One more take, please.

77
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,515
I love the live shows best.

78
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:43,916
Yeah.

79
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:47,020
I hope this doesn't come across wrong,

80
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:49,455
but I do other gigs
so that I can do live shows.

81
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:52,258
People find out about us from YouTube,

82
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:54,994
and we make them want to come
to our live shows.

83
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:57,297
When I do TV shows,
I learn skills from others

84
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:59,132
and use them to MC for SixTONES.

85
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:01,401
People see me on TV
and decide to come to a show.

86
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:05,538
We've always had it tough.

87
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:07,840
So, I'm not used to things going our way.

88
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:11,844
When things go well, I'm caught off guard.

89
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:15,281
I'm so used to running into obstacles.

90
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:20,586
It gets scary when things go so smoothly.

91
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:22,255
I guess it's a habit of mine.

92
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:25,792
We've been with Johnny's Jr. for so long.

93
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:27,060
The more gigs we do,

94
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:29,962
the more difficult it is
to believe in good fortune.

95
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,400
{\an8}<i>June 2019.</i>

96
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:36,469
{\an8}<i>SixTONES have been offered a big role.</i>

97
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:39,305
{\an8}<i>This could be a chance for SixTONES</i>

98
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:41,607

99

<i>People still get their group name wrong.</i>

100
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:49,015
We're SixTONES.

101
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:50,583
Is it a rising or falling intonation?

102
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,652
-SixTONES.
-What? Come again?

103
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,587
{\an8}-SixTONES.
-So falling?

104
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:56,389
{\an8}SixTONES. They're SixTONES.

105
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:59,192
{\an8}-Either way is okay.
-Yeah, it's fine.

106
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:01,127
We'll still respond either way.

107
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,529
SixTONES, please get on set.

108
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:07,500

148
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,026
When we reunited,

149
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:18,764
For me, it was like, "This is it.

150
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,801
If this doesn't work,
it's never going to work."

151
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:27,507
If we debut, we will no longer be able
to operate the way we do now.

152
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:32,912
I... don't think we can.

153
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,281
I want to stay the way we are.

154
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,682
But I also want to debut.

155
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,519
It's a dilemma.

156
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:43,456
As a rule of thumb right now,

157
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:47,293
I don't think about the future.

158
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:53,966
Whatever task is in front of me
on a given day,

159
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,335
I give it 100 percent.

160
00:08:56,402 --> 00:09:00,406
I worry about tomorrow later.
That's my creed.

161
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:07,547

what's going to happen to us.

00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:58,598
{\an8}JOINED FEBRUARY 2009

172
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:02,768
{\an8}<i>He gained attention
from the moment he joined,</i>

173
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:07,506
<i>but was unable to make a breakthrough.</i>

174
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,244
I was giving up hope because of my age.

175
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:14,947
I thought I had no choice but to quit.

176
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:17,717
That was when they formed SixTONES.

177
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:21,621
I knew this would be my final gamble.

178
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:23,956
You were about to quit?

179
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:25,658
That's right.

180
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:30,129
I didn't want to quit. I wanted to stay.

181
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:33,833
However, I knew I had little choice.

182
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:38,471
I was being given
fewer and fewer opportunities.

183
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:44,043
I needed to become irreplaceable.

184
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:47,079
I felt, "The other five will outshine me
in whatever we do.

185
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,547
There's no point in competing."

186
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:54,420
I decided to voice my requests,

187
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,856
no matter what people might think.

188
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:02,662
I was only able to learn to do that
thanks to Jesse.

189
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:06,999
I really owe that to him.

190
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:09,735
-Is that so?
-Absolutely.

191
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:14,006
I was always the shy, pessimistic type.

192
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,443
Then, Jesse came around.

193
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:22,481
He said I needed to speak up
about what I wanted to do.

194
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:26,552
I was still sulking then.
I didn't take his advice.

195
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:30,056
To be honest, people around me told me

196
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:33,092
that there was no point in trying.

197
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:37,530
But if you don't give it a try,
you'll never get better.

198
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:39,865
If you don't speak up,
you don't get the chance.

199
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:44,837
I love and enjoy acting,
so I said I wanted to do more.

200
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:52,011
<i>Matsumura is working
on his career as an actor</i>

201
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:54,046
<i>outside of SixTONES.</i>

202
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:58,050
<i>He is preparing for a role.</i>

203
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:02,288
<i>He will play the role of a man
who plays wheelchair basketball</i>

204
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:05,491
<i>in a TV drama series.</i>

205
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,027
<i>Today, he will practice
with an amateur basketball team.</i>

206
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,665
I couldn't get the shooting form right.

207
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:15,501
You've nailed it now.

208
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,337
I spent the night
at my best friend's house

209
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:21,741
and asked him to teach me.

210
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:25,644
As a thank you, I treated him to dinner,
though it wasn't much.

211
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:31,617
I was practicing like this,
using a round cushion in his house.

212
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:37,890
All night I was practicing
giving the ball a push like this.

213
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:45,664
<i>Next, he learns practical
wheelchair basketball techniques.</i>

214
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:47,833
<i>It's not easy,</i>

215
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:52,271
<i>but he is thankful for this environment
where he can work on getting in character.</i>

216
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:02,047
Oops.

217
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:10,990
<i>Mastering his passion.</i>

218
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:16,896
<i>That is what Matsumura has been doing,
just like the other members.</i>

219
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:23,569
Are we ready?

220
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:28,908
{\an8}<i>That's how he has earned
his current status as an actor.</i>

221
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,209
{\an8}<i>PERFECT WORLD</i> SET

222
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:32,211
Action!

223
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:46,258
This is a wrap for Mr. Hokuto Matsumura!

224
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:52,264
<i>Today is that last day Matsumura is on set
to film the TV drama series.</i>

225
00:13:55,501 --> 00:14:00,472
<i>The staff surprise him
with an early birthday celebration.</i>

226
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:03,976
-Thank you.
-Congratulations!

227
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:15,855
<i>He is starting to find a path of his own,
away from SixTONES.</i>

228
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:21,827
I don't know what to say.

229
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:24,897
Please become a superstar.

230
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:27,266
I will.

231
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:30,703
MID-JULY

232
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:36,008
<i>It's July, and the largest event
for Johnny's Jr. is looming closer.</i>

233
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:38,711
Just one thing.
You know how we do "SHAKE" here?

234
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:42,381
The kids auditioning this year
will come on stage during "Darling."

235
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:46,952
<i>Three hundred Johnny's Jr. idols
will gather</i>

236
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:49,088
<i>to put on a live show at Tokyo Dome.</i>

237
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:56,161
<i>SixTONES' members are all busy
with their individual gigs.</i>

238
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:58,898
I'm on a prime time TV drama.

239
00:14:58,964 --> 00:14:59,999
Oh!

240
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,469
Yep, Mondays at 9:00 p.m.

241
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:05,304
I'm performing at the Imperial Theater.

242
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,973
With Mr. Ikusaburo Yamazaki.

243
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,042
You're all very busy.

244
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:12,144
Jesse is overseas right now.

245
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:16,248
He's being filmed for a TV show.

246
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:19,084
Hokuto's finished filming
for a drama series.

247
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:20,920
Now I'm starting filming for a drama.

248
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,889
-He's playing futsal.
-Futsal?

249
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:25,791
{\an8}That's right.

250
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:26,759
{\an8}YUGO KOCHI (25)

251
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:28,861
{\an8}-For work?
-For fun.

252
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:31,297
{\an8}Simply as a pastime.

253
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:36,135
<i>Everything seems the same.</i>

254
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:37,436
Let's do it later.

255
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:44,076
<i>However, just a little while earlier,</i>

256
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:46,745
<i>they were told that their CD debut
had been decided.</i>

257
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:57,356
<i>The news will be officially announced
during the live show at Tokyo Dome.</i>

258
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:02,027
<i>Until then,
the news must be kept confidential.</i>

259
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:11,337
<i>It is time to brace themselves
for a CD debut.</i>

260
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:17,843
As you climb to the top, spread out.

261
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:20,546
AUGUST 8, 2019

262
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:25,117
<i>It is the day of the Johnny's Jr.
Tokyo Dome live performance.</i>

263
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:31,323
<i>Kochi was filming several shows
that he is a regular on,</i>

264
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,459
<i>and was on set until the very last moment.</i>

265
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:36,662
-Hello. Thanks for waiting.
-Let's go,

266
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:39,031
Please hop on. Climb in.

267
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:43,369
-Phew.
-You came running.

268
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:46,705
I feel so bad about today.

269
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:48,440
I...

270
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,744
Everyone worked hard
to let me leave on time.

271
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:56,548
Usually we finish early,
but today we ran overtime for some reason.

272
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,220
I can't thank the staff enough.

273
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:10,429
-We have the show at Tokyo Dome next.
-Yes.

274
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,533
SixTONES is on a roll right now.

275
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:18,037
I mean, you're really gaining momentum.

276
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:20,105
Many things are in store for you.

277
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:22,074
-I guess...
-Does it feel surreal?

278
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,543
Does it feel surreal?

279
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:27,813
I'm going to completely honest.

280
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:33,085
It feels like SixTONES has gotten so big,

281
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:35,754
and I am being left behind.

282
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:41,727
Every gig that the management brings to me
is so big.

283
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:47,433
I don't think I am fit
for the roles they assign to me.

284
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:55,874
Let's go.

285
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:58,043
<i>It has been 19 years</i>

286
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:01,346

287
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,116
<i>The curtain is about to rise.</i>

288
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,459

290
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:19,398
{\an8}<i>that Johnny's Jr. has had

<i>SixTONES' performance is about to begin.</i>

00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:56,835
Were you waiting to see us?

297
00:18:57,202 --> 00:19:00,038
Okay, let's get this rocking! Everybody!

298
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,963
<i>The time has arrived.</i>

299

DOUBLE CD DEBUT!!

301
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:46,285
<i>There was a moment of hesitation

302

This is the news
we wanted to share with you.

We'll talk later.

Sorry I couldn't tell you.

311
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:48,907
<i>The six seem to be lost in thought.</i>

312
