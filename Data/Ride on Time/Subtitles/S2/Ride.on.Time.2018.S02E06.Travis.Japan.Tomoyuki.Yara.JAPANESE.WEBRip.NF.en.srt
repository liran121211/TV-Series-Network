{\an8}FORGING A PATH WITH DANCE

2
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,980
{\an8}The issue goes on sale October 23rd,
and you'll be on the cover!

3
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:15,348
{\an8}Yes! Thank you!

4
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:16,750
{\an8}Very cute.

5
00:00:16,816 --> 00:00:18,218
{\an8}<i>Travis Japan.</i>

6
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:22,322
{\an8}<i>A Johnny's Jr. unit who has big things
expected of them in the future.</i>

7
00:00:27,093 --> 00:00:29,029
{\an8}<i>Dancing is their weapon.</i>

8
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:33,033
{\an8}<i>First formed seven years ago,
though they've yet to make their CD debut,</i>

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,102
{\an8}<i>they've won over their fans
through their performances.</i>

10
00:00:37,737 --> 00:00:38,972
{\an8}<i>And now,</i>

11
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,308
{\an8}<i>their first solo show
is getting a lot of attention.</i>

12
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:46,980
{\an8}<i>With expansion overseas on the horizon,</i>

13
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,149
{\an8}<i>they're trying their hand
at entertainment.</i>

14
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:51,351
{\an8}<i>Action and acrobatics</i>

15
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:53,486
{\an8}<i>unfold at a frenzied pace.</i>

16
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:59,159
{\an8}<i>Even their signature, dance,</i>

17
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:02,095
{\an8}<i>is entering a new realm of expression.</i>

18
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:06,766
{\an8}<i>The choreography for this has been handled</i>

19
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:10,270
{\an8}<i>by one of Johnny's leading performers,
Tomoyuki Yara.</i>

20
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,306
Make the world spin.

21
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:15,241
Make the world spin?

22
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:17,677
-Like this.
-Wow!

23
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:18,878
You made it spin!

24
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:20,814
You just made the world spin.

25
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:23,583
Ouch!

26
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,418
You're spinning a lot,

27
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:27,887
but it hurts because your legs aren't.

28
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:30,924
Watching Yara makes me feel bad
about myself.

29
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,358
Seeing him choreograph,

30
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:34,260
he looks so good.

31
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:35,228
SHIZUYA YOSHIZAWA (24)

32
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:39,666
I'm never satisfied.
And they're the same as me like that.

33
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:42,268
They have crazy energy.

34
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:43,937
-On the next one...
-It's wrong.

35
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:46,539
-Be quiet.
-That hurt!

36
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:50,777
<i>In the days leading up
to the start of their show...</i>

37
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:54,914
Hey! Coach!

38
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:59,219
<i>...a new way of crafting a performance
begins for them.</i>

39
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:26,146
<i>This is documentary series</i> Ride On Time.

40
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,487
<i>Ni hao</i>.

41
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,199
-Okay, everyone?
-Okay.

42
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:49,736
-Then you pack it in.
-Yes!

43
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,108
That's the speed.

44
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:07,353
Okay.

45
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:12,192
{\an8}It's a tricky genre.
Yara always picks difficult genres.

46
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:13,426
{\an8}KAITO MATSUKURA (22)

47
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:17,430
{\an8}I'm not good at house
or lots of little steps.

48
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:20,500
You don't want the dance to beat you?

49
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,737
It's more that
I don't want to fall behind.

50
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:27,540
Whoa!

51
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:30,410
-He's very flexible.
-He is.

52
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:32,645
Some dancers...

53
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:33,746
RYUYA SHIMEKAKE (24)

54
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:36,115
...kindly came here from overseas

55
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:37,850
to give some lessons.

56
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:41,421
The lessons were about three hours long,
and one hour was stretching.

57
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:44,591
It was really painful,
and I was suffering.

58
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:46,793
I hated that, so I did it every day.

59
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:49,062
-And now you can do that.
-Yes.

60
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:52,665
Was that in 2010?

61
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,068
That's right.

62
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:57,503
Nine years ago. That brings back memories.

63
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,173
{\an8}-I was in the same lessons.
-Were you?

64
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,542
{\an8}NOEL KAWASHIMA (25)

65
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:05,044
Loads of people took the lessons at first,

66
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:09,148
but the numbers gradually went
down and down.

67
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:12,986
Before we knew it,
there were only a few of us left.

68
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,289
And then we ended up doing a show.

69
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:17,590
Did you?

70
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:19,525
It was through that

71
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,427
that Travis Japan came to be.

72
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:24,430
That was the very start of Travis Japan.

73
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:26,399
-Yep.
-Wow!

74
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:27,567
The band of survivors.

75
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:30,403
We survived.
By the time we realized it, we'd survived.

76
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:34,407
I'm glad I worked so hard back then.

77
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:40,280
{\an8}<i>Travis Payne,
who did choreography for Michael Jackson,</i>

78
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:43,716
{\an8}<i>singled out Travis Japan
along with Johnny Kitagawa.</i>

79
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,687
<i>Their fate since forming
has been to refine their dancing.</i>

80
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:51,891
{\an8}<i>So, as you might expect,</i>

81
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:55,094
{\an8}<i>they've had a long time
to think about dance.</i>

82
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:56,462
{\an8}KAITO NAKAMURA (22)

83
00:04:57,597 --> 00:05:00,633
I can't dance how I want to anymore.

84
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,369
-Right.
-So now...

85
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:07,507
I don't know how my dancing looks

86
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:11,778
to the people who are watching me.

87
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:14,380
-You can't tell how you're moving?
-No.

88
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:18,184
Maybe you should try
dancing for yourself again?

89
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,055
Don't worry about your form.

90
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:24,157
Come to the studio by yourself,

91
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:26,826
play music you like,
and see how it makes you move.

92
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:28,461
What makes you feel great?

93
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:31,030
Don't worry about anyone else.

94
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:33,433
Whatever dance you have inside of you,

95
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:35,201
we can definitely use for this.

96
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:36,869
-Yes.
-Okay?

97
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,009
{\an8}<i>Kaito Miyachika is the leader.</i>

98
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:44,844
{\an8}<i>He respects Yara</i>

99
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:47,513
{\an8}<i>for his thorough approach to dance
and for forging his own path.</i>

100
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:49,682
For that dance,

101
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:52,785
if you're having fun doing it,
I'll be having fun watching.

102
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:57,490
It's about player-to-player communication.

103
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:01,227
So, as you do this step and this step,

104
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:05,264
just by looking at each other,
it will give it a whole different feel.

105
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:10,603
If I could attain Yara's level
of performing ability,

106
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,906
then, as a member of Travis Japan,

107
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:16,976
even if we take on bigger
and bigger challenges,

108
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,479
I'll have nothing to be afraid of.

109
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:22,248
That's why...

110
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:26,152
That's why, getting to feel that up close

111
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:28,621
in this studio is a treat.

112
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:34,026
<i>Spending time with a respected senior
is invaluable.</i>

113
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:41,000
<i>The first song that they'll be taking on</i>

114
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,169
<i>is the onethey most wanted
Yara to choreograph.</i>

115
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:49,142
-Okay.
-Please will you do it?

116
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,077
-Of course.
-Thank you.

117
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:53,279
-Can I make it flashy?
-Yes.

118
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:54,414
All right, then.

119
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,349
Thank you.

120
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,466
<i>When creating a dance routine,</i>

121
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:17,403
<i>Yara first listens to the song repeatedly
to build up a vision in his mind.</i>

122
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:28,514
This is tricky.

123
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:40,460
<i>Every time he's come across
a new kind of music,</i>

124
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:43,062
<i>he's expanded the range of moves
in his arsenal.</i>

125
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:54,307
What steps would be interesting for this?

126
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:58,211
You were telling them to dance
for themselves.

127
00:07:58,277 --> 00:07:59,212
Yes.

128
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:03,249
Do you have any worries
like they do, Yara?

129
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:05,485
-Yes, loads.
-Is that right?

130
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:12,291
I think many people want to show things to
others but lack an environment to do so.

131
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:16,028
People like that...

132
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:20,600
do things like go to dance lessons,

133
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:22,869
or dance in clubs.

134
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:26,873
They do that for themselves.

135
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,209
But I think it's great. It shows strength.

136
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:36,215
If you like dancing,

137
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:41,120
and you don't worry about other people
and just face yourself...

138
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:46,025
That moment when you
and the music become one...

139
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:56,802
When you do that,
you see something new come out.

140
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:04,243
<i>He's spent days facing himself,
searching for answers.</i>

141
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:08,714
<i>That's what's gone into the moves
he's created for his students.</i>

142
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:10,983
It's difficult.

143
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:15,821
Thanks!

144
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:18,357
<i>The day the whole routine
is put together is here.</i>

145
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:36,976
Oh, man! This bit!

146
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,011
It's the thing I'm worst at.

147
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,516
It's cool, but will I be able to do it?

148
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,685
Practice until you feel like dying.

149
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,457
-The shuffle.
-Yes.

150
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,626
Learn this shuffle dance.

151
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:57,663
<i>Yara has choreographed</i>

152
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:02,001
<i>something he's also newly learned,
a shuffle dance.</i>

153
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,251
Okay!

154
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:39,672
-Okay?
-Yes.

155
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:42,108
-I'm fine.
-Do it again later.

156
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:43,943
-I'll practice.
-Let's do it.

157
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:46,612
Next...

158
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:55,187
You spin around.

159
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:57,356
Yes.

160
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,293
Right, left, right.
Look at the lines on your forehead!

161
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,463
-I can't do it at all. This sucks.
-Is it hard?

162
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,399
It's fun, I like it.

163
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:08,434
I like Yara's choreography.

164
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,270
So, I'm having fun, but I can't do it

165
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,639
and everyone else is getting it
straight away.

166
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:14,540
They're skilled.

167
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:16,409
That really sucks.

168
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:21,113
It's like, "Damn. Move, feet!"

169
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,650
I'm sure there must be a better way

170
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:26,018
for me to teach this.

171
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:27,853
He's doing well, isn't he?

172
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,757
Don't get me wrong, he's great.
Most people couldn't do this.

173
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,395
Are your legs feeling okay?

174
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:06,726
<i>In addition to dance,
the show will feature</i>

175
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:11,630
<i>a vast array of performances
including acrobatics and action sequences.</i>

176
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,401
-No good.
-You were close!

177
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:16,836
All right.

178
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:21,907
<i>They must master a variety of skills
that are completely new to them.</i>

179
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:53,506
I don't get it.

180
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,610
{\an8}There are just too many things
that I've never experienced before.

181
00:12:57,676 --> 00:12:58,611
{\an8}GENTA MATSUDA (20)

182
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:03,916
And we're doing something new
again tomorrow.

183
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:21,567
<i>Everyone is working as hard as they can
to overcome their own challenges.</i>

184
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,508
FULL REHEARSAL

185
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:31,243
<i>Six days before the show.</i>

186
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:35,314
<i>They're rehearsing the whole show
from start to finish for the first time.</i>

187
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,285
<i>They've memorized routines
for all 12 songs,</i>

188
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:14,987
<i>and made it to the end.</i>

189
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:17,289
Please get yourselves some water.

190
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,858
-Yes.
-Yes.

191
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:24,430
<i>However, while Yara usually praises them
with a smile on his face,</i>

192
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:25,931
<i>today...</i>

193
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:32,204
-Thank you for that, everyone.
-Thank you.

194
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:34,573
Well...

195
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:39,378
You just ran through two acts,

196
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:45,851
but I thought you were really flat
throughout the whole thing.

197
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:47,987
Let's see.

198
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:52,091
Right now, it's not about each individual

199
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:55,861
working their hardest,
it's about the team.

200
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:00,766
You need to communicate better,
for instance.

201
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:08,007
Like the moment Chaka and Kaito
are dancing together like this.

202
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:11,410
I don't see anything there at the moment.

203
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:16,715
Right now, you're not showing me
how you feel the sound

204
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:19,218
in any way whatsoever.

205
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:22,321
"They're working really hard."

206
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,525
"They're going for it with the dancing."

207
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:28,460
It didn't get past that.

208
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:35,501
If you don't start looking at
how you can expand

209
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:38,504
and how you can express yourselves,

210
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:41,307
you'll all blur into one.

211
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:47,379
So, shall we dig a little deeper
to make this even better?

212
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:51,450
If we do,

213
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:54,053
you'll be better performers for it.

214
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:05,597
All done.

215
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:10,069
I was wondering what you made

216
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:12,538
of what Yara said to you earlier.

217
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:17,509
Yeah.

218
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:23,649
I guess...

219
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:28,854
The thing is...

220
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:34,093
How can I put it?

221
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,363
He's...

222
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:41,133
He's right, I guess.

223
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:47,606
That's...

224
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,177
Kind of...

225
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:55,914
Yes, it's really...

226
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:04,823
Give me a second.

227
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:09,161
I don't really like this kind of thing.

228
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:15,534
To be honest, it hurts.

229
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,708
He's right.

230
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,412
Yara's done so much.

231
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:32,751
He's always given us all kinds of advice
while we've been practicing.

232
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:37,856
And I think as we did it,

233
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:40,292
that came through today.

234
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:44,329
He's someone I respect, but...

235
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,166
I don't know how to explain it.

236
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:49,902
It's...

237
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:53,505
Just as we're about to start
the real thing...

238
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:57,109
It's...

239
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,679
We've come a long way.

240
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:05,050
I don't know.

241
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,161
You were quite harsh on them.

242
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:20,566
Yes. Those were my thoughts,
pure and simple.

243
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:25,571
But maybe I said that to them
because they are Travis.

244
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:30,676
It was a great performance.

245
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,579
But there are different angles
to look from.

246
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:38,951
Not just from here,
but from here and here.

247
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:42,488
I think they'll be brilliant
if they get that, don't you?

248
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:44,289
When they're such good dancers.

249
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:46,692
-Absolutely.
-Right.

250
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,294
They can do it. I'm sure of it.

{\an8}SUNSHINE THEATER, IKEBUKURO

252
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,734
{\an8}<i>The show is looming.</i>

253
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:59,972
<i>Will they be able
to live up to Yara's expectations?</i>

254
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:07,713
"I'll do my best" and all that...

255
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:11,250
<i>Yara is conveying his feelings
up until the last minute.</i>

256
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:14,887
I'm sure you'll put the effort in,

257
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:18,490
but have confidence in yourselves.
That's all it is, really.

258
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:20,459
Thank you.

259
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:28,000
This really is something I want to take on
with the maximum effort possible.

260
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:32,337
It's because I felt the passion
that Travis has.

261
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:35,407
-Let's do it.
-Okay.

262
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:37,976
I'll see you soon.

263
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:39,878
-Mind your hip.
-Yes.

264
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:41,346
See you soon.

265
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:42,781
All right!

266
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:45,984
-Thank you!
-Okay!

267
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:47,252
Thank you.

<i>The moment their eyes meet,</i>

270
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:33,131

271
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:15,107
{\an8}<i>The path cut open by dance is steep.</i>

{\an8}<i>Nevertheless,</i>

273
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:21,580

274
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:24,416
{\an8}<i>they'll aspire to greater

275

{\an8}<i>we meet an idol unit whose members

278

I'm constantly searching to find
what we're capable of doing.

Our debut?

283
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:03,822
This is crazy. I'll give it my all.

284

{\an8}<i>And they make their way

285
