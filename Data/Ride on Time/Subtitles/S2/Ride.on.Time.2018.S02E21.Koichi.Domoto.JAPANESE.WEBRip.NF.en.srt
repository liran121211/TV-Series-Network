00:00:01,568 --> 00:00:02,469
Good morning.

2
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,043
Should we shoot it at an angle?

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,444
-No.
-There'll be a reflection.

4
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:12,379
True.

5
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,448
-Opposite way round?
-Maybe.

00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:25,225
{\an8}KOICHI DOMOTO (41)

7
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:26,292
{\an8}Thanks.

8
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,129
How do you feel about the camera?

9
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:30,663
-Oh, I hate it.
-I thought so.

10
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:31,564
Yes.

11
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:33,099
Why?

12
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:36,970
When the camera points at me,
I think things like,

13
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:40,173
"I'd better be quiet,"
but I'd like to stop that.

14
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:43,243
I don't think my normal, unaffected self,

15
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:49,649
the me that hasn't gone through training,

16
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,951
is not worth being seen,

17
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:58,491
or rather, is not worth showing
through the camera.

18
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:02,495
Like, what's interesting about that?

19
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:04,831
I'm not interesting at all.

20
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:09,402
Even if I put on a concert,
I wouldn't do anything for the fans.

21
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:14,841
You know how fans often talk
about "fan service"?

22
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:19,112
I'm the type of person
who doesn't do anything like that.

23
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:28,088
Well, I say that,
but doing a documentary

24
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:33,760
and showing my unvarnished self
scares me a little.

25
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,086
<i>This is documentary series</i> Ride On Time.

26
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:06,192

00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:08,194
{\an8}Good morning, everyone.

28
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:09,629
Good morning, Koichi.

29
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:14,701
Now, the flight check for act one.

30

31
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:21,474

-OK.

34

39
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,771
Troupe leader, the tension?

40
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:55,542
-How is it?
-Well...

41
00:02:58,077 --> 00:02:59,579
A bit less over here.

42
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:00,914
A bit less.

43
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:04,317
-Okay, here we go.
-Ready.

44
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:08,488
All right, then. Ready, set, go!

45
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:11,891
Whoa!

46
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:16,296
I'm fine, but I heard weird cries.

47
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,905
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm fine.

00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,239

<i>It may be their first time,</i>

63

<i>but they're still members of the company

64
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:42,882
If you hold it this way, it'll smack you.

65
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:44,984
-Here, see?
-Huh?

66
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:54,127
Matsu, how about a demonstration?

67
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,362
You got it.

68
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:09,409
{\an8}YUSUKE MATSUZAKI

69
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,544
{\an8}Once more, Matsu. Show him one more time.

70
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:14,981
Over here this time.

71
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,988
That was great.

72
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,391
Now, let's practice.

73
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:30,530
{\an8}MINATO MATSUI

74
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:35,702
Here goes.

75
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,475
Yes.

76
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:43,710
-Okay?
-Yes.

77
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:45,078
You've got this.

78
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:50,183
{\an8}I also performed in <i>MILLENNIUM SHOCK</i>
20 years ago.

79
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:51,851
{\an8}YUSUKE MATSUZAKI

80
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:54,287
{\an8}But I didn't know anything.
I didn't appreciate it.

81
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,656
Like, "What's so great about
the Imperial Theatre?"

82
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,393
Yes. So, I joined 4U in 2006,

83
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:02,428
although it wasn't called 4U at the time.

84
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,831
Well, I got them to let me perform,

85
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:07,867
but back then, if I said hello to Koichi,

86
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:10,169
he wouldn't even meet my eyes.

87
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:13,373
He wouldn't even say "good morning" back.

88
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:14,907
That's how he was.

89
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:17,744
And look at him now. It's like...

90
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,645
he stands out more.

91
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:22,115
He's really changed, huh?

92
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:24,384
Koichi is changing alongside <i>SHOCK</i>.

93
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:29,021
So, we can change, too,
and we are. It's fun.

94
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:34,727
{\an8}SHOCK <i>began when Domoto was 21 years old.</i>

95
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:38,364
{\an8}<i>An idol taking the stage
in the Imperial Theatre,</i>

96
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:41,334
{\an8}<i>with its long tradition,
reportedly drew criticism.</i>

97
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:44,470
{\an8}Remember your place, they said.

98
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:48,174
{\an8}Yes, how could I forget?

99
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:51,577
{\an8}Well, I'd heard he was distant.

100
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:55,148
{\an8}It was tough in the beginning,
until he opened up.

101
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:59,719
He couldn't really communicate.

102
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:01,788
It makes you feel sorry for him,
doesn't it?

103
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:05,124
I think he must have been lonely.

104
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:10,029
{\an8}Now, with Minato, with newcomers
like Taiga and Minato

105
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:13,065
{\an8}he's just generally friendly
in his interactions.

106
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,235
He's able to
suddenly get closer to people.

107
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:19,405
I bet that Koichi did a lot
of soul-searching to get that way.

108
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,141
He gives you a feeling
like being inside a cocoon of warmth.

109
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,143
It's like, year by year,

110
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:27,313
as Koichi gets older,

111
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,349
something protective about him,

112
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:33,519
a kind of broad-mindedness, grows in him.

113
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,456
What changed him so much?

114
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,691
I'm not really sure.

115
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:41,194
I wonder what it was?

116
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:49,368
<i>While bearing the title of troupe leader
at the Imperial Theatre,</i>

117
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:52,338
<i>Domoto performed and rebuilt this show.</i>

118
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:58,478
<i>Only he understands those 20 years.</i>

119
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:15,394
Has anyone done
this strength training exercise before?

120
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:17,730
Like this, at a gym?

121
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:22,034
Do this part with your pectorals.

122
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:25,771
Don't do it like this.

123
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,208

00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:32,545

<i>Domoto is pressing

128

When you rise up,

129
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:08,581
think, "Whew, this is it!"

130
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:11,817
Whew!

131
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,223
I'll say that as I do it.

132
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,759
If you just get up quickly like this,

133
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:21,093
it will be totally boring.

134
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,473
{\an8}<i>The dance was choreographed</i>

135
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:37,410

00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:04,704

139
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:12,912
Okay.

140
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,816
-Last one?
-Two more times. Give it your all.

141

Remember L.A.

144
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,168

{\an8}<i>and Travis Payne instructed them

Whoa, that was close.

152
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:24,650
I got on my knees
and begged them to give me a break!

153
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:30,556
You've got to practice this hard.

154
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,625
It starts once you're exhausted.

155
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:43,269
When Travis came to Japan
to make his final check,

156
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,405
well, he gave us
a pretty hard time then, too.

157
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:50,710
I guess that's a funny way to put it.
It was out of affection.

158
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:52,411
He's a strict person, huh?

159
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:54,280
Travis is gentle,

160
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:56,682
but Stacy, who works with him, is strict.

161
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,452
Yes.

162
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:01,721
"Give it your all! Two more times!"

163
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,356
I was like, "Are you serious?"

164
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:07,626
It was something like that. So, well,

165
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:10,096
after we did that,

166
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,632
Travis and Stacy said...

167
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:17,903
Once everyone was really exhausted,

168
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:23,776
so exhausted we couldn't stand anymore,

169
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:25,544
the two of them said,

170
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:30,316
"After this, we're all family."

171
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:31,851
And we really were.

172
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:37,423
It was the moment
we all shared the same pain.

173
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,426
But there was a wonderful sense
of accomplishment in that.

174
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:44,430
Yeah. Of course,
it was work that we'd done

175
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:46,866
to make a single production better.

176
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,770
Domoto will join in.

177
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:52,304
Okay!

178
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:38,083
That's right.

179
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:48,694
Let's finish with,
"We should get together now!"

180
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:50,229
Be careful not to go too fast.

181
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:51,897
Yes.

182
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:53,799
We're anxious to get this over with.

183
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,701
We might rush.

184
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:05,578
{\an8}FEBRUARY 4, 2020 <i>ENDLESS SHOCK
20TH ANNIVERSARY</i>, OPENING DAY

185
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:09,148
{\an8}<i>Opening day arrives.</i>

186
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:13,953
Thank you for waiting.

187
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,121
We will now check tickets from row six.

188
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:19,058
Please have your tickets in hand
and do not spread out.

189
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:31,470
Thank you.

190
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,707
-It's a pleasure.
-It's a pleasure.

191
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:36,275
The pleasure is all ours.

192
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:37,209
Oh.

193
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:38,811
Yay!

194
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:52,358
-<i>It's starting
-It's starting</i>

195
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:54,760
-<i>Once it starts
-Once it starts</i>

196
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:57,429
-<i>It'll end soon
-It'll end soon</i>

197
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:59,798
-<i>We'll go home soon
-We'll go home soon</i>

198
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:03,469
Okay, it starts today! <i>Endless SHOCK 2020</i>!

199
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:07,239
Let's do our usual! One, two!

200
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:10,009
Show must go on!

201
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:16,782
<i>The 21st year of</i> Endless SHOCK

202
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:20,786
<i>is about to open.</i>

203
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:36,568
<i>It's Koichi Domoto's 21st year,</i>

204
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:42,474
<i>and his 1,732nd performance begins.</i>

205
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,810
None of us can keep up with you anymore!

206
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:52,845
Tatsuya!

207
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:55,881
Enough.

208
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,984
You're no longer welcome on this stage.

209
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:02,454
Come on, Koichi, calm down.

210
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:35,020
Well, I've got no desire
to do something special

211
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:38,223
just because it's the 1,700th
or 1,800th show.

212
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:43,128
So, it takes an amazing self
and amazing mean-spiritedness...

213
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:45,564
If I say something like this,
I'll be really hated.

214
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:48,867
I don't mind.
I'm fine with being disliked.

215
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:53,272
Well... I'll do it as normally
as closing day.

216
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,509
There's a phrase,
"Going home on opening day."

217
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,711
When you put on a show,

218
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:01,647
people expect something special

219
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:06,852
just because it's the last day, you know?

220
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,620
I don't like that feeling.

221
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,624
I'm awful, aren't I?

222
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:13,859
Maybe a little.

223
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:19,031
No, no, it's just kind of...
Still, it's true,

224
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:21,700
I don't really want to make
anything special.

225
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:25,070
You're really always neutral, huh?

226
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:28,674
Well, otherwise,

227
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,043
I can't do it.

228
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:35,247
You could call it neutral,
but when it comes to this work,

229
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,749
I'm always surpassing my limits.

230
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:40,686
Well...

231
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:43,956
"I'm tired
and it's the second performance,

232
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,191
so I guess I'll cut corners."

233
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:52,064
The minute you get like that,
it's already over.

234
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:57,336
It... stops being fun,

235
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,639
and you lose sight of what was wrong.

236
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:05,344
I'm scared of that.

237
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:08,847
Yeah, I'm scared.

238
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:11,416
If it came to that, I think...

239
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:14,987
the moment I became like that,
I'd never be able to stand on stage again.

240
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:09,374
You see, the stage...

241
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:15,981
Yeah...

242
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:19,384
I think the stage is amazing.

243
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:23,822
It's like...

244
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:27,859
Well, it's like that
for the people performing

245
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:30,262
and for the people watching.
It makes people...

246
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:32,931
Hmm...

247
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,034
It's like...

248
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:40,806
Words like "enchant" and "charm"
are such clichés,

249
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:42,541
but it's more than that.

250
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:46,845
It's a place where it feels like...

251
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:52,217
something possesses you.

252
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,087
Yeah.

253
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:02,494
Well, we have 70 shows to go.

254
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:06,365
I'm beat.

255
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:10,102
Still, it's one performance at a time.

256
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:14,306
I want to treasure each one.

257
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:18,277
{\an8}Ten years later...

258
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:20,279
{\an8}I doubt you think about it too much,

259
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:24,650
{\an8}but do you want to be doing this
in ten years?

260
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,352
{\an8}I doubt I could keep doing <i>SHOCK</i>.

261
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,187
{\an8}Ten years...

262
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:31,957
{\an8}I might have said the same thing
ten years ago.

263
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:35,894
{\an8}When it comes to <i>SHOCK</i>,

264
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,132
{\an8}I doubt I'll be able to keep it up.

265
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:41,733
{\an8}Probably.

266
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:46,605
{\an8}Actually, I'm not even sure
if I'll live to be 50.

267
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:51,843
{\an8}Yeah...

268
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:55,781
-Thank you.
-It was interesting.

269
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:57,115
Thank you very much.
