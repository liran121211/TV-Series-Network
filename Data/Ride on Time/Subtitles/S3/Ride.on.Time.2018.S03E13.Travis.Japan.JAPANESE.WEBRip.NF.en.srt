OCTOBER 10, 2020

2
00:00:22,088 --> 00:00:24,824
<i>There's one thing that's never happened.</i>

3
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:30,830
<i>Having the warmth of an audience</i>

4
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:33,066
<i>in front of you.</i>

5
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:40,407
<i>It's a feeling I've never had before.</i>

6
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:47,647
My back is killing me.

7
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:54,521
<i>"You're with Johnny's, right?"
"You can't dance, right?"</i>

8
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:59,092
<i>As members of Johnny's, we can't have
people like that underestimating us.</i>

9
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:05,065
We need to shine brighter,

10
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:07,367
and confidently stand on stage.

11
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,270
-Good!
-Yeah! Here I go!

12
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:11,738
Go for it.

13
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:17,177
It's not like we know
the names of each individual.

14
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:22,715
<i>Or how each one cheers us on.</i>

15
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:25,318
<i>None of us know.</i>

16
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:38,098
<i>However, the fact that we can
definitely meet each other...</i>

17
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,303
...is something that really touched me.

18
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:49,275
SHINBASHI ENBUJO THEATRE
FIRST PERFORMANCE IN 225 DAYS

19
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:19,038
<i>This is documentary series</i> RIDE ON TIME.

20
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:23,176
Good morning.

21
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:24,544
Thanks for being here.

22
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:25,612
JULY 2020

23
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:32,519
There's something going on.

24
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:34,187
It's <i>RIDE ON TIME</i>.

25
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:35,688
Oh! Starting today?

26
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:36,823
Yes.

27
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,025
-It's been a while.
-Yes, it has.

28
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:44,063
Hey, guys!

29
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,565
-Hi.
-We have friends.

30
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,567
Oh, nice to see you again.

31
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:49,135
-Good morning.
-Morning.

32
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:50,069
-From today?
-Yes.

33
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:51,604
Good to have you.

34
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:52,972
Nice to see you again.

35
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,209
-Looking forward to working with you.
-Long time no see.

36
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:59,045
Good to have you here!
It's been a long time.

37
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:02,549
<i>They are the Johnny's Jr. idol group</i>

38
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:04,284
<i>Travis Japan.</i>

39
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,518
Good morning.

40
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:06,986
I'm here too.

41
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:09,889
-Good morning.
-Hi.

42
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:17,130
<i>This group of seven
has skyrocketed in popularity.</i>

43
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:36,149
How many months will you be with us?

44
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,919
As of right now, we want to
film up to the <i>Torajya</i> show again.

45
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:41,087
Right.

46
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:44,490
{\an8}We don't even know what'll happen.
I hope we can do it.

47
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,392
{\an8}NOEL KAWASHIMA (26)

48
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:49,128
{\an8}-Creating the narrative must be hard.
-True.

49
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:50,997
{\an8}There's the trampoline too.

50
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:54,968
We've lost a lot of
rehearsal time because of COVID.

51
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,204
-Is he too hidden?
-Yes, maybe...

52
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,974
Kawashima, can you come forward a bit?

53
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,308
Like there?

54
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:06,479
Not right in front of me!

55
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:15,321
<i>Their greatest weapon
is their high-precision dancing.</i>

56
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:17,457
<i>Their coordinated dance videos</i>

57
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:20,793
<i>marked the arrival of
a new type of Johnny's group.</i>

58
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:28,635
<i>That's why they care
so much about their dancing.</i>

59
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,674
{\an8}<i>They made sweeping choreography changes
to other Johnny's songs</i>

60
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:37,677
{\an8}<i>and recreated them as their own.</i>

61
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:41,714
{\an8}<i>Many of the numbers were choreographed
by the members themselves.</i>

62
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:46,819
{\an8}<i>Seeing a need to make a performance
group fit for the world stage,</i>

63
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:49,789
{\an8}<i>Michael Jackson choreographer Travis Payne</i>

64
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:54,460
<i>handpicked the Travis Japan members
with Johnny Kitagawa.</i>

65
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,533
<i>In other words, perfecting their dancing</i>

66
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,703
<i>has been their mission
ever since their formation.</i>

67
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:10,043
It's crazy fun.

68
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:16,316
{\an8}I did the choreography and structuring
for the "Entertainment" number.

69
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:18,017
{\an8}RYUYA SHIMEKAKE (25)

70
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:19,952
What made you want to do that?

71
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,423
Well, you know...

72
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:31,597
I wondered what it would be like
to create something from my imagination.

73
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:34,367
I wanted to challenge myself.

74
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:41,307
{\an8}<i>The other members involved in choreography
are Shizuya Yoshizawa</i>

75
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:44,110
{\an8}<i>and the leader Kaito Miyachika.</i>

76
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:47,413
{\an8}KAITO MIYACHIKA (23)

77
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:53,986
Just go ahead and pick
another song or two.

78
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:55,688
-Okay.
-Then put them in.

79
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:59,258
We can do "VOLCANO" now,
and two new songs.

80
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:00,727
Okay.

81
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:03,396
-How about putting it in a formation?
-Okay.

82
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:13,906
<i>During rehearsal, they fine-tune
their choreography and positioning.</i>

83
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:18,311
<i>They all have strong convictions
towards dancing,</i>

84
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,848
<i>and strive to become a group
that specializes in performing.</i>

85
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:34,026
Five, six, seven.
One and two and three and four.

86
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:45,605
One, two, three.

87
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,911
I run across this a lot too.

88
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:57,483
{\an8}There are times when it's actually cooler
when you loosen up a bit.

89
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,152
Instead of this,

90
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:01,254
try something like this.

91
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,223
Just emphasize the key points.

92
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,259
The rest can be more loose.

93
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:09,796
It's about how relaxed you can be
with high tempo songs.

94
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:12,932
It's reassuring to dance in a group.
You're not alone.

95
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:15,668
So it's like you're enjoying that.

96
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:18,905
However, none of you
are who you were a year ago.

97
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:20,606
You're completely different.

98
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:23,109
-You've all really grown.
-Thank you.

99
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:24,544
It's so fun!

100
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,449
A performance that stands on its own.

101
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:33,486
You don't know who to look at,
but when they're all together,

102
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:35,755
it's really cool and in-sync.

103
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:38,925
You just wish you had more eyes!

104
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:41,561
I consider that the mark of
a good performance.

105
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:45,565
They're really great, like real dancers.

106
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:46,732
-Really?
-Yes.

107
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:53,306
{\an8}KAITO NAKAMURA (23)

108
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:11,390
You were really into it.

109
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:13,493
Not at all.

110
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:17,463
I still have a long way to go.

111
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,599
It's not ready to show people yet.

112
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:20,733
Really?

113
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,669
Have you learned the moves?

114
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:25,972
It's like that's all I've done.

115
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:30,610
I couldn't charge people to watch this.

116
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,979
You really love dancing.

117
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:36,549
Yeah well, that's all I've ever done.

118
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:45,791
{\an8}We're seriously not good at all.

119
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:49,161
{\an8}We might be a little confident,

120
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:52,665
but we don't think we're good.

121
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:59,372
I mean, in the end, we're artists.

122
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:03,042
We're Johnny's idols.

123
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:07,547
We have to be able to sing, dance,
and be expressive.

124
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:12,351
We have to be able to do it all.

125
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:17,323
I've recently realized that
we can't make it with just dancing alone.

126
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:22,995
{\an8}<i>Of the 200 members of Johnny's Jr.,</i>

127
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:26,699
{\an8}<i>Travis Japan currently has
the most senior status.</i>

128
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:28,568
{\an8}Hey, flex your muscles for me.

129
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:32,872
Thanks.

130
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,943
That was really awesome.

131
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:39,211
-Are you friends?
-No.

132
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:40,379
He's your senior.

133
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:42,148
Yeah, he is.

134
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:44,216
Do you think of him as your senior?

135
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:45,318
I mean, he is.

136
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:46,519
Really?

137
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,987
A really cool senior.

138
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:49,956
-Really?
-Seems pretty casual.

139
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:51,290
It does seem casual.

140
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:53,492
How could you say that?

141
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:55,294
{\an8}Are we having fun?

142
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,229
{\an8}AUGUST 26, 2020

143
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:59,298
{\an8}<i>Eight years since their formation,</i>

144
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:01,767
{\an8}<i>they've paid their dues.</i>

145
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:05,304
{\an8}<i>They're now waiting patiently
for their CD debut.</i>

146
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:09,442
{\an8}<i>What is it that they truly need as idols?</i>

147
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,711
{\an8}<i>They are still searching.</i>

148
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:17,917
Our performance is one of our weapons.

149
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:24,056
{\an8}Mr. Johnny told us that,
so I'd like to ensure that it always is.

150
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,858
{\an8}KAITO MIYACHIKA

151
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:29,528
{\an8}However, that's hard to do.

152
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:34,133
Has that conversely been something
that's tied you down?

153
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:38,104
That's not how it feels to us,

154
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,905
but it could be the case.

155
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:43,976
You can easily say you want to be good,

156
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,379
but it's difficult to achieve.

157
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:54,520
There is definitely a part of me
that gets distressed by dancing.

158
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:59,592
However, there are good dancers
who exist in the world.

159
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,027
Which means,

160
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:05,865
there's no reason we can't become
good dancers as well.

161
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:10,036
That's something that I think

162
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:12,972
we need to work on even more.

163
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,976
SEPTEMBER 2020

164
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:21,547
<i>It's September, and the seven members
were planning their livestream show.</i>

165
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:29,522
<i>It was meant to be performed five
months ago in front of a live audience.</i>

166
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:48,274
{\an8}<i>Shizuya Yoshizawa is one of the members
in charge of choreography.</i>

167
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,642
{\an8}SHIZUYA YOSHIZAWA

168
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:53,913
{\an8}<i>He had previously revealed his
complicated feelings toward dancing.</i>

169
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,751
You didn't join because you loved dancing?

170
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:04,657
Not at all, if anything I hated dancing,
I mean, it's tiring.

171
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,560
I don't really like working up a sweat.

172
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:10,696
I never thought idols
did that kind of stuff.

173
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:18,003
<i>However, he was selected to join a group
striving to be the best at dancing.</i>

174
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,715
I mean, seriously.

175
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,419
What can I do to actually enjoy dancing?

176
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:35,254
I don't know.

177
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:43,395
<i>Despite this, he continued to practice,
even getting involved in choreography.</i>

178
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:46,565
<i>Now he's an integral part
of the group's performance.</i>

179
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:51,737
You know.

180
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:56,876
Unlike everyone else,
I'm not really good at dancing.

181
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,778
I can think about it, though.

182
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:02,915
I can think about it and come up with
my own choreography,

183
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:06,719
but I never did
much dancing to begin with.

184
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:10,456
I never took lessons,
so doing it my way is all I know.

185
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:12,658
I see.

186
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:15,594
Five, six, seven, eight.

187
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:18,964
One, two, three, four,

188
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:22,568
five, six, seven, eight.

189
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:26,672
Then step back, step back. Bam, bam.

190
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:33,746
<i>Yoshizawa choreographed this number
to perform at their next show.</i>

191
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:48,627
You want to angle...

192
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:53,532
<i>In addition to choreography,
he has to convey to the other members</i>

193
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:56,902
<i>the vision he has
for moving around the large space.</i>

194
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:04,510
Then we come together...

195
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:07,746
and go to the front.

196
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:14,053
A little slower.
Like be at the front on six.

197
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:15,454
That startled me.

198
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:20,559
If we get to Stage B by the second measure
once the interlude starts,

199
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,795
we should be able to make it.

200
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:26,298
I want Shizuya to be here
for the rap break.

201
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:29,568
I think it could be
even more towards the front.

202
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:30,970
-Here?
-Around there.

203
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:31,871
That's far.

204
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:35,708
Maybe while one is rapping,
the others can move.

205
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:37,877
If it's here, the next part is far.

206
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:38,978
Oh is it?

207
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,579
I mean, this is number 11.

208
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:42,581
-What if I ran from here?
-Should work.

209
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:43,782
Then I'll do that.

210
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:46,585
If you run from "Get your hands up!"

211
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:48,053
You might make it.

212
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,827
I think that's just enough if you run.

213
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,629
So try to time it to that.

214
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:59,798
We'll have to wait a bit
if you do it from here.

215
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,703
This is crazy.

216
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:08,841
Everyone's so good,
it's harder to teach them.

217
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,482
It's hard work.

218
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:22,655
I mean, I could be more demanding,
but all seven us have our opinions.

219
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:24,857
There are a lot of ideas.

220
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:27,326
You know how it is.

221
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:34,066
Shizu weirdly lacks confidence.

222
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:35,601
I don't know why.

223
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:39,605
I mean, he has the support
of the fans and all of us too.

224
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,407
He should be confident.

225
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:45,678
Although, I get that's just who Shizu is.

226
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:49,014
<i>Shizu is the type of person</i>

227
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:52,418
<i>who loses confidence
if he tries and doesn't see results.</i>

228
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:54,920
<i>Even though he's had a lot of results.</i>

229
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:09,702
NOVEMBER 2020

230
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:13,038
Nice, it went in.

231
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:17,009
<i>Playing basketball
is one of his favorite hobbies.</i>

232
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:24,850
<i>This day, he's joined
by a junior he's close with.</i>

233
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:29,722
I keep missing.

234
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:35,227
You'll have a better chance of making it
if you know how far you can throw it.

235
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,364
Shoot, I hit it.

236
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:41,200
{\an8}-Do you admire Shizuya?
-Yes, he's the best.

237
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:42,267
{\an8}I respect him.

238
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:44,570
{\an8}He also loves <i>Torajya</i>.

239
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:47,272
There's a lot I can learn.

240
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:52,244
Basketball is about how cool
you can make it look.

241
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:53,479
I see.

242
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:55,748
I hate showing off.

243
00:16:57,449 --> 00:17:02,988
With basketball, you just naturally
look cool dribbling or making shots.

244
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,792
Maybe that's why I like it.

245
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:09,962
You don't have to worry
as long as you make it.

246
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,830
-As long as you make it.
-Yeah.

247
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:18,003
That would've been cool if I made it.

248
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,272
It happens.

249
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:22,408
I wish I had made it.

250
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:30,182
I talked with Miyachika, and he said that

251
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:34,953
you're the type of person who loses
confidence if he doesn't see results.

252
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,522
Yeah.

253
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:37,756
That's true.

254
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:43,429
It's like, if I don't get praised
for something I won't improve.

255
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:47,566
I don't know...

256
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,637
Also, for example,

257
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:56,542
if someone in the group is being
asked to do the choreography,

258
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:58,744
my name's not the first to come up.

259
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:00,712
Shime is the one usually picked.

260
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:02,047
-Really?
-Yeah.

261
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:05,217
That's another reason why
I don't have confidence.

262
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:08,987
It's like, it doesn't have to be me.
I'm just the last resort.

263
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:10,422
-I see.
-Yeah.

264
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:14,493
-You want the guys to acknowledge you.
-Yeah, I'd change if they did.

265
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,563
They don't acknowledge me. Those jerks!

266
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:20,966
Yeah.

267
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:25,471
Although, the guys and the fans
tell me that I'm needed.

268
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:26,572
Yeah.

269
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:30,242
So I think,
"Well, what is it they need then?"

270
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:33,645
I don't have anything.
I don't have any weapons.

271
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:38,250
So then I think, "What could I
possibly have that no one else does?"

272
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,789
SEPTEMBER 26, 2020
DAY OF THE LIVESTREAM SHOW

273
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:45,757
<i>Something only he has.</i>

274
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:48,293
<i>What could that be?</i>

275
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:58,504
<i>The show will go on whether
he's found the answer or not.</i>

276
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:21,126
{\an8}SEPTEMBER 26, 2020
LIVESTREAM SHOW

277
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,672
<i>It's our first show together in a while.</i>

278
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:37,342
Our audience
is watching over us from afar.

279
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:40,812
Let's make sure
we live up to their expectations.

280
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:41,780
Yeah!

281
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:45,350
Let's see which of us
can have the most fun!

282
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:47,486
You're on!

283
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,523
Let's get this started!

284
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:56,595
Yeah, come on.

285
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:36,068
<i>I hate being in the front.</i>

286
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:42,441
<i>However, I've finally gotten comfortable
being at the front of the stage.</i>

287
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:44,876
<i>I've finally reached that place.</i>

288
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:45,911
<i>That's good.</i>

289
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:50,616
Everyone's a good dancer
and a hard worker.

290
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:56,154
I don't think we would've made it
if we had someone who didn't try.

291
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:58,323
Everyone works hard.

292
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:03,095
I mean, if they didn't
I don't think I'd be able to.

293
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:09,434
I need to get better at dancing.

294
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:11,903
-You're not good enough?
-Not at all.

295
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:15,340
I'm probably still at the bottom
of the dance world.

296
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,043
I mean, I don't know.

297
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:22,881
I don't know if that's true,
but I think there's more I can do.

298
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:25,384
I'm not good enough.

299
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:28,553
I think I need to put in more work.

300
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,458
What do you think of him?

301
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:37,329
I think he's cool the way
he can talk about this.

302
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:39,831
Oh, man!

303
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:42,467
None of my juniors think of me that way.

304
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:45,537
I usually get disrespected by my juniors.

305
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:47,472
They tease me.

306
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:05,991
{\an8}<i>Next time, they begin rehearsing
for their stage play.</i>

307
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:09,061
{\an8}We didn't get along.

308
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:10,095
{\an8}I hated him.

309
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,397
{\an8}We didn't hit it off at all.

310
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:15,334
{\an8}<i>What are their thoughts on teamwork?</i>

311
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,902
