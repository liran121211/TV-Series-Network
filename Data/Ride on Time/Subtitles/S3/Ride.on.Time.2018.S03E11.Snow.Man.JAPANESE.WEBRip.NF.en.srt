<i>A moment during the 17 year old's
after-school time.</i>

00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:09,542
NOVEMBER 2020

3
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:15,548
I love to go on walks.

4
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:22,489
I love to walk around
places I don't know in the city.

5
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:24,724
Really, that's a surprise.

6
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:28,294
The aromas drifting
from regular households,

7
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:33,400
like the smell of baths
or the smell of curry is what I love.

8
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:43,009
{\an8}<i>The center position of idol group Snow Man
is filled by the high schooler, Raul.</i>

00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:44,377
{\an8}RAUL (17)

10
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:49,649
Right now, my...

11
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:57,090
The view that I think is amazing
in this moment

12
00:00:57,624 --> 00:01:02,328
was completely unimaginable a year ago.

13
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:09,035
It kind of makes me hope that next year
I can have an unimaginable view too.

14
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:12,939
Seriously, you only live life once.

15
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:39,365
<i>This is documentary series</i> RIDE ON TIME.

<i>Both Japanese and Western,</i>

00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:56,883
{\an8}<i>In January 2020,</i>

20
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:01,387
{\an8}<i>this nine-member group made
their long-awaited debut as Snow Man.</i>

{\an8}<i>With their remarkably high dance skills,</i>

23
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,834
{\an8}<i>they released another
best seller last year.</i>

24
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:22,675
Where is your end goal?

25
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:24,711
Someplace no one's ever been.

26
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:30,083
We could do this and even this,
but probably a position beyond that.

27
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:35,221
That's probably the place I'm aiming for.

28
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,493
{\an8}<i>That is Hikaru Iwamoto,</i>

29

{\an8}<i>the leader of Snow Man, which originally
formed nine years ago with six members.</i>

30

<i>While working their way up,</i>

31
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:50,637
<i>each of them polished their character
over the long years.</i>

32
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,507
HIKARU IWAMOTO (27)

33
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:58,878
<i>The one who leads Snow Man
with an iron body, Iwamoto.</i>

34
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,416
Who would fit the <i>yokai</i> role?

35
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:07,353
{\an8}<i>The excellent talker who livens the scene,
Tatsuya Fukazawa.</i>

36

{\an8}TATSUYA FUKAZAWA (28)

37
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:10,924
{\an8}Right. In other words, who's the monster?

38
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:15,395
<i>The key person in acrobatics,</i>

39
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:17,330
{\an8}<i>Daisuke Sakuma.</i>

40
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:20,033
{\an8}DAISUKE SAKUMA (28)

41
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:28,474
{\an8}<i>The one who illuminates the stage
with his serene voice, Shota Watanabe.</i>

{\an8}SHOTA WATANABE (28)

{\an8}RYOTA MIYADATE (27)

46
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:44,557
{\an8}I'm Ryohei Abe. This time's...

47
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:48,928
{\an8}<i>The one who is very popular

{\an8}RYOHEI ABE (27)

49
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:55,535
As a result the character
I created is the only one of its kind.

50
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:59,606
I want to keep arming myself
with lots of different skills.

51
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:05,979
{\an8}<i>And then there's the three new
personalities who added fresh color</i>

52
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,748
{\an8}<i>to that Snow Man group.</i>

53
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:15,755
<i>October.</i>

54
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:20,627
-You brought them all?
-Yes, as props.

55
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:21,995
Then I'll use them all.

56
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:27,467
<i>One member was facing a photo shoot.</i>

57
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:30,270
-Nice!
-Yes.

58
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,006
Three, two, one!

59
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:34,807
Nice sound!

60
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,243
Nice sound!

61
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:43,316
{\an8}<i>Koji Mukai first joined
Snow Man two years ago.</i>

62
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:44,317
{\an8}<i>On this day,</i>

63
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:47,987
{\an8}<i>he was not the one being photographed,
but the one taking photos.</i>

64
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:52,959
<i>Making use of
his long-time photography hobby,</i>

65
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:56,362
<i>he began a series last year
in a weekly magazine.</i>

66
00:04:56,863 --> 00:05:01,534
<i>In each volume he receives
guidance from popular photographers.</i>

67
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,571
{\an8}<i>The instructor this time</i>

68
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:10,276
{\an8}<i>is Mr. Masashi Asada,
who takes photos in humorous settings.</i>

69
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,478
{\an8}PHOTOGRAPHER
MASASHI ASADA

70
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:16,849
<i>The setting Mukai attempted was...</i>

71
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:19,519
Right, so...

72
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:24,324
the crime scene
is certainly expressed now.

73
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,859
So if this person's presence
was a bit more...

74
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:27,794
Ah, I see!

75
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,329
-More expressed...
-I see.

76
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:30,496
-Here.
-Here.

77
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:32,865
Three, two, one!

78
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,602
All right!

79
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:37,737
-It's good?
-Yeah.

80
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:40,506
Then let's have you look
at the depth of field.

81
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:43,009
I'm not really confident on the focusing.

82
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:51,451
<i>He entered Kansai Johnny's Jr.
at twelve years old</i>

83
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,620
<i>and always kept his work base in Kansai.</i>

84
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:00,693
<i>His specialty was comedy.</i>

85
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:04,197
<i>However, despite reaching
his mid-twenties,</i>

86
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:06,733
<i>his chance to debut never seemed to come.</i>

87
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:12,238
<i>Then in January 2019,
he moved to Tokyo and joined Snow Man.</i>

88
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:18,044
<i>At first, he was barely able to keep up
with the other members.</i>

89
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,145
JANUARY 2019

90
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:24,617
It's so fast.

91
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:26,919
...two, three, four!

92
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:32,425
Jet Pistol!

93
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:43,069
<i>Mukai had soon begun to point his camera
at his fellow members who supported him.</i>

94
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,942
Isn't this awesome? Cool, huh?

95
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:54,547
It's a 135 millimeter, a superzoom lens.

96
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:58,985
I always carry this with me
to capture our members' portraits.

97
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:01,621
I capture...

98
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:05,224
Well, their smiles,
but I guess their natural selves?

99
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:09,562
<i>When I publish their natural selves,</i>

100
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:14,000
<i>all the members are pleased,
so that's why I do it.</i>

101
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:17,136
<i>You know, I'm very shy.</i>

102
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:22,575
<i>It's like I can learn about everyone
through a picture and a camera,</i>

103
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:25,812
<i>so I'm always grateful that
they let me photograph them.</i>

104
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:27,914
That's how I feel.

105
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,950
And all our fans enjoy it as well,

106
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:37,690
so it encourages me
and it leads to my motivation, yeah.

107
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:39,358
You're good! I knew it.

108
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:40,460
A little this way...

109
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:42,528
There's a car coming.

110
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:45,331
One's coming from that way too. Careful.

111
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:50,303
<i>For Mukai right now,</i>

112
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:53,272
<i>Snow Man is a valuable place
where he belongs.</i>

113
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,341
Isn't this good?

114
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:56,909
Oh, nice! Looks really good!

115
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,244
It's good, huh?

116
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,488
Okay, roll the camera.

117
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:15,561
<i>There was one other personality
that was added to the group as well.</i>

118
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:25,104
<i>The one who joined
at the same time as Mukai...</i>

119
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,175
<i>Ren Meguro.</i>

120
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:33,779
REN MEGURO (23)

121
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,018
"Mr. Handsome's coming"? I'm here.

122
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:44,590
But, you know, the great part about him
is that he's a good guy.

123
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:47,593
He's found his special weapon
and is wielding it.

124
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,897
Like how he says he's working
on his comedy.

125
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:53,666
So he really knows how to manage himself.

126
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:55,334
He compliments a lot.

127
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:56,869
He's smooth, right?

128
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,604
A smooth talker.

129
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:00,873
But I wanna say what's good about people.

130
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:06,345
You know how it's harder to compliment
a person if you become too close to them?

131
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:08,981
Most people are like that,
but I wanna say it.

132
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:13,019
It makes for a better relationship.
If something's good, I say it.

133
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:16,422
If anyone else said that, it'd sound fake,

134
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:19,525
but when you say that,
it feels very natural.

135
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:21,227
Well, I could say that too.

136
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:23,963
Something like that...

137
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,165
Two, two, three, four,

138
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,867
five, six, seven!

139
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:32,939
<i>He also diligently worked
on acrobatic training.</i>

140
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:37,209
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight.

141
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:38,911
Two, two, three, four,

142
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:40,546
five, six, seven!

143
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,951
-It's all spirit.
-Backflips are about spirit. 98% spirit.

144
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:48,654
OCTOBER 2020
PHOTO SHOOT

145
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:52,458
<i>That attitude never changes
even in his personal work.</i>

146
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,530
And put one hand in the pants pocket.

147
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,464
Okay.

148
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:07,173
<i>He has been modeling for a men's
fashion magazine for three years.</i>

149
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:11,644
You make him change here?

150
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,915
-Can I have an <i>onigiri</i>?
-Go ahead.

151
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,154
You skipped breakfast?

152
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,424
I didn't eat.

153
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:34,367
<i>He is always dedicated
to any work he's given.</i>

154
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:43,709
<i>Behind his work ethic lies
his feelings toward the peers of his past.</i>

155
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:50,316
<i>Meguro entered the agency
at thirteen years old.</i>

156
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:52,852
<i>Once he had trained for about six years,</i>

157
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:57,657
<i>a unit called Uchu Six was formed
and they worked toward their debut.</i>

158
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:03,963
<i>However, in January 2019,</i>

159
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:09,935
<i>Meguro had joined Snow Man alongside
of the unit and a busy life ensued.</i>

160
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:15,408
I went on tour with ARASHI to Osaka.

161
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:21,947
I got back at around 11:30 last night,

162
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:25,418
and I heard we were doing this today,

163
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:29,355
so I asked for a video of the routine.

164
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:34,460
I practiced it right until morning
before I came in today.

165
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:37,096
What time was it?

166
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:40,032
Maybe about 5:00 in the morning.

167
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:41,667
Thank you.

168
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:44,603
<i>In the end,</i>

169
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:48,741
<i>Meguro decided to narrow down
his work to just Snow Man.</i>

170
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:55,581
<i>The time when he broke the news
to his Uchu Six members</i>

171
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:58,084
<i>is still carved into his heart.</i>

172
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:09,295
When I narrowed down to Snow Man only,
of course I had mixed feelings.

173
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:11,130
But how do I put this?

174
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:15,000
My Uchu Six members at the time
all understood me.

175
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:19,805
They really cheered me on saying,
"Do your best. You can do it."

176
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:23,976
Or, "You have talent,
so I always knew you could do it."

177
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:27,580
Like, they gave me some
unbelievably kind comments.

178
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,982
How do I say this?

179
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:35,187
You know how nothing is definite
with Johnny's Jr., right?

180
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:38,224
I mean, we each have our own life,

181
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,360
and we're each taking a gamble
with that life, you know?

182
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:44,196
So everyone understands that too.

183
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,932
The Uchu Six members all understood that.

184
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:52,571
That's why, maybe they thought,
"You have your own life too."

185
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:57,343
They may have thought
like that for my sake.

186
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:04,917
So for the people
who have encouraged me and my life,

187
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:08,521
I want to make it one I can truly enjoy.

188
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:09,889
-I see.
-Yes.

189
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,759
How embarrassing.

190
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:16,996
Thank you very much. Thanks.

191
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:24,036
{\an8}OCTOBER 2020

192
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:28,774
{\an8}<i>And in October,
a large opportunity approached Meguro.</i>

193
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:35,481
<i>This is the filming of the monumental show
that aired during New Year's,</i> Kyojo 2.

194
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:38,450
Okay!

195
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,390
<i>The setting is based in a police academy.</i>

196
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:47,493
PROPER HAND SALUTE

197
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,896
How do I put it?
He says, "Then I'll go," with concern.

198
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:52,464
It's written right there.

199
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:57,570
<i>Meguro plays the student who causes
the incident that is key to the story.</i>

200
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:08,881
<i>Playing the instructor role beside him
is one of his seniors who he looks up to.</i>

201
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:14,720
TAKUYA KIMURA

202
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:18,524
Ready, action!

203
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:21,260
REHEARSAL

204
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,598
Good work, sir.

205
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:41,580
It says, "I should quit the police,"
and, "I shouldn't quit," here.

206
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:45,284
Write each reason under them.

207
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,422
-And cut!
-Cut!

208
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:06,772
<i>Even after the cut,
he remains in character.</i>

209
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:14,013
DIRECTOR ISAMU NAKAE

210
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,948
REHEARSAL

211
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:18,217
Okay.

212
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:19,652
And cut!

213
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:36,735
Okay, quiet please!

214
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:38,938
FILMING

215
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:40,973
Ready, action!

216
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:46,879
<i>During the filming, Meguro sustained
that posture the entire time.</i>

217
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:55,888
END OF FILMING

218
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:03,796
<i>Once his senior speaks to him,
he finally eases up.</i>

219
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:15,341
To be able... to work with Mr. Kimura

220
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:20,145
I think is probably
a once-in-a-lifetime event.

221
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:24,350
So, when the camera's rolling
as well as when it's not,

222
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:27,553
I just want to keep watching him.

223
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:31,323
Like, the way he is on-site
or what do you call it...

224
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,658
how he carries himself?

225
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,460
Within that tense atmosphere,

226
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:40,966
I was challenging myself the entire time
to see how much I was capable of doing.

227
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:42,768
Even after the cut,

228
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,104
you kept your back straightened.

229
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,372
That's right.

230
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:53,379
Once I got on-site, I thought of staying
a police academy student the entire time.

231
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:57,483
That's why my back
is killing me right now.

232
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:03,255
<i>This was the last scene
filmed on this day.</i>

233
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:08,027
Each of your steps
are different lengths, so...

234
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:13,665
<i>They decided to practice
with all of the student roles.</i>

235
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,269
<i>Then...</i>

236
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:24,009
<i>Meguro's senior who wasn't being filmed...</i>

237
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:26,111
Forward!

238
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:38,290
<i>...stood by in character,
watching over his acting.</i>

239
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:45,197
One... One...

240
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:48,667
<i>"To be acknowledged as an actor
like his senior."</i>

241
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:54,740
One, one, one, two...

242
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:57,109
<i>He hopes to fulfill this dream one day.</i>

243
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:07,386
{\an8}<i>Last year, one of Japan's biggest
fashion shows was held without spectators,</i>

244
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:09,488
{\an8}<i>the Tokyo Girls Collection.</i>

245
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:18,030
<i>The other irreplaceable personality
from Snow Man appeared on that stage.</i>

246
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:24,236
<i>The 17-year-old center, Raul.</i>

247
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:33,078
<i>His dance is all freestyle.</i>

248
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:43,489
I feel super good!
There's nothing more to say.

249
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:51,063
<i>Currently, even brands overseas
are focusing on Raul for modeling.</i>

250
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,866
Another two or three shots
and we'll finish.

251
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:54,766
Okay.

252
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:59,071
{\an8}Ready, action!

253
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:04,977
{\an8}<i>Furthermore, he had been assigned the lead
in a movie due to release this summer.</i>

254
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,515
Cut!

255
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:21,560
NOVEMBER 2020

256
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:26,064
<i>How does Raul see
his current 17-year-old self?</i>

257
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,268
Now...

258
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:38,710
I've always said it up until now,
but I think I've been extremely lucky.

259
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:43,682
That's probably what I'll think
right before I die too,

260
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:46,051
"Wow, I was extremely lucky."

261
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:51,790
I'm not trying to be modest by saying,
"I was just lucky."

262
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,993
Well, I'm sure there are
many different opinions,

263
00:19:55,060 --> 00:20:01,066
but I was able to join Johnny's,
and I was able to join Snow Man.

264
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:05,437
There must have been a reason for it,

265
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:11,143
so I feel that I myself
shouldn't ever forget that.

266
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:15,314
I wished for something to happen twice
and something did happen twice.

267
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:18,183
There are better groups than us,

268
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,587
amazing singers or artists
who can dance more.

269
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:24,923
If you look around the globe,
there's plenty of them.

270
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:30,395
Well, so this is the interesting part
about entertainment.

271
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:35,300
I just wish for something to happen
with all my heart.

272
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:38,136
That's why I'm really spoiled.

273
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:43,976
And while I think that I'm spoiled...

274
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:47,646
If someone asked what I'll do
to compensate for being spoiled,

275
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:50,282
I'd just say,
"I'll work desperately hard."

276
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:55,087
We'll desperately work hard
in the environment given to us,

277
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,889
and I'll wish for something to happen.

278
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:03,061
Anyone who talks like that is obnoxious,
so I'm gonna work hard.

279
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:08,433
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

280
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:18,610
-Wow!
-Excellent!

281
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:24,283
<i>At last, Snow Man was approaching
the moment to fulfill one of their dreams.</i>

282
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:28,453
Oh, what's all this?

283
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,422
-I'm honestly excited!
-Awesome!

284
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:32,124
The display alone is insane!

285
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:37,496
<i>After being canceled due to COVID-19,
their long-awaited debut was here.</i>

286
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:45,871
It's made the fire
within me burn stronger.

287
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:49,941
{\an8}<i>The next episode is their debut concert,</i>

288
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:53,278
{\an8}<i>and Snow Man dashes through to a new year.</i>

289
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:56,248
{\an8}I want to do a concert
using just our own songs.

290
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,917
{\an8}<i>However, an unexpected situation occurs.</i>

291
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,585
{\an8}Ugh, damn it!

292
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:01,653
{\an8}Which leg?

293
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,055
{\an8}I sprained it.

294
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:04,289
{\an8}Happy...

295
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:06,792
{\an8}New Year!

296
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:07,693
{\an8}Hi.

297
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:10,829
{\an8}We're Snow Man!

298
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:15,434
{\an8}Snow Man is just awesome!
