1
00:00:01,568 --> 00:00:02,969
{\an8}Let's just have fun.

2
00:00:03,036 --> 00:00:04,537
{\an8}-Okay!
-Yeah! Let's go!

3
00:00:04,604 --> 00:00:06,306
{\an8}Yeah!

4
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:08,174
{\an8}-Woo!
-Thirty seconds.

5
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:14,381
{\an8}<i>Sexy Zone's concert had been
postponed since March due to the pandemic.</i>

6
00:00:14,981 --> 00:00:17,450
{\an8}I'm so happy.

7
00:00:18,618 --> 00:00:20,086
{\an8}We can finally do it.

8
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:23,023
{\an8}It's all love. Nothing but love.

9
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:26,593
{\an8}<i>After eight months, the answer they found</i>

10
00:00:26,659 --> 00:00:29,496
{\an8}<i>was an online concert
with no audience present.</i>

11
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:33,700
{\an8}Stand by!

12
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:37,137
{\an8}<i>Time to go where their fans await them.</i>

13
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:05,498
<i>This is documentary series</i> RIDE ON TIME.

14
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:08,802
{\an8}We talked together about this.

15
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:10,236
{\an8}<i>August.</i>

16
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:12,672
{\an8}<i>A meeting to discuss the online concert.</i>

17
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:17,444
{\an8}SEXY ZONE
SO MATSUSHIMA (23)

18
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:20,146
Actually, if it wasn't a livestream...

19
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:23,016
Between the four of us,

20
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:28,822
doing a live concert with Matsushima
wasn't even on the table.

21
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:33,259
Since it's a livestream,
it's something we can try.

22
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:36,463
MATSUSHIMA RETURNS

23
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:39,432
<i>He hasn't been onstage for a concert</i>

24
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:42,235
<i>for about two and a half years.</i>

25
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:44,003
Before the MC?

26
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,606
I could come out on the daily special.

27
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:47,507
Sounds good.

28
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:48,808
That could work.

29
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:51,144
You could appear in two spots.

30
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:53,913
Song-wise, it would be three songs.

31
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:57,417
You'd be appearing here and there.

32
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:02,555
That makes it special
and I think it works for a stream.

33
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:11,498
{\an8}<i>Matsushima will appear for two songs
in the middle and the final song.</i>

34
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:23,710
I haven't seen rehearsals
in such a long time.

35
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:27,347
It really feels like a concert is coming.

36
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:30,083
I'm thrilled. I'm excited.

37
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,453
To see the four perform is so cool.

38
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,455
It's a work in itself.

39
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:39,092
But performing as five
is another work.

40
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,162
I hope we can bring that to everyone.

41
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:51,137
<i>The final number of the concert is
"RUN" with all five members.</i>

42
00:02:54,607 --> 00:03:00,079
During the last hook,
all five run in five directions.

43
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,950
-Okay.
-And then... Three people here.

44
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,486
<i>Above all else,
they want their fans to see</i>

45
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:09,889
<i>a performance only Sexy Zone can give.</i>

46
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:13,993
Their homes will be the concert venue,

47
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,930
so I feel more motivated than ever.

48
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,466
If the dancing is half-hearted...

49
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:24,304
Since our faces won't be easy to see,

50
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,740
the things we convey will be different.

51
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:31,177
OCTOBER 18

52
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:34,080
<i>Compared to their previous concerts,</i>

53
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:36,950
<i>this will be done
in a different environment.</i>

54
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:45,191
We had a few things to remake and relearn.

55
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:48,228
People will watch us closely.

56
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:50,830
It's kind of like folding picture toys.

57
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:56,336
We're making it our focus
to show a lot of different things.

58
00:03:57,203 --> 00:04:00,206
If they're with us, we can see the fans,

59
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:04,377
so we can visually check
if they're having fun.

60
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:08,414
But with a screen,
we don't know if they're having fun.

61
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:10,250
So my confidence...

62
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:13,786
It makes me easily discouraged, I think.

63
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:18,558
<i>A stage without an audience.</i>

64
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:22,562
<i>How will the five face it?</i>

65
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:27,700
{\an8}OCTOBER 28
CONCERT REHEARSAL

66
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:31,137
{\an8}<i>It was time for the on-site rehearsals.</i>

67
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:45,184
<i>Kikuchi stood before 15,000 empty seats.</i>

68
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:52,692
The situation won't be much different
from a rehearsal.

69
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:58,865
If I let myself get too carried away
by my excitement while performing,

70
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:03,703
I might feel sad
when we see the empty seats.

71
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:07,106
So I have to keep my excitement in check

72
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:09,242
by not having too much fun.

73
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:15,581
<i>They prepared
something special for the show.</i>

74
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:22,755
So's on here.

75
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:28,761
We're the only ones with this.
Only five were made.

76
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,667
The merchandise is like this.

77
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:40,673
It was everyone's idea.

78
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:52,685
{\an8}<i>Finally, the three-day-long concert's
curtains are drawn.</i>

79
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:58,324
<i>October 29. It's showtime.</i>

80
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:00,159
Good morning.

81
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:04,197
Good morning. Let's do this!

82
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,399
Good morning.

83
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,002
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

84
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:13,072
Good morning. See you today.

85
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:14,340
Morning.

86
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:16,542
Good morning.

87
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:22,815
Where will you be watching from,
besides your three songs?

88
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:26,652
I'll be in the PA seats, with the staff.

89
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,955
Upstairs on the B stage side.

90
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:30,757
I'll be able to see from above.

91
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:32,992
I'll be there this time.

92
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,529
I won't be able to see them directly...

93
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:43,870
I wish we could meet the people
who love our music most.

94
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,340
We're going!

95
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:49,642
-Let's go!
-Shall we go?

96
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:51,077
We're going!

97
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:53,179
Here we go.

98
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:56,182
My hands are so sweaty.

99
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:01,154
<i>It's finally time.</i>

100
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:06,859
Let's just have fun.

101
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,461
-Okay.
-Yeah! Let's go!

102
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:10,163
Yeah!

103
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:12,098
-Woo!
-Thirty seconds!

104
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:19,005
Wow, I'm happy.

105
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:21,874
We can finally do it.

106
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:25,144
They can finally see us and see this.

107
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:28,080
It's all love. Nothing but love.

108
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,652
<i>Irrepressible elation.</i>

109
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:37,723
Stand by!

110
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:41,027
<i>Time to go where their fans await them.</i>

111
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:57,743
"KYOKUTO DANCE"

112
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:31,210
Hey, Sexy Lovers on
phones, tablets, and computers!

113
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:33,746
Is your Wi-Fi network pumped?

114
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:51,497
<i>Backstage, it's a battle against time
as they change quickly for a solo song.</i>

115
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,637
<i>The one who always
leads in performances.</i>

116
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,739
<i>The eldest, Nakajima.</i>

117
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:05,478
<i>The one who has grown
to take a more prominent role, Marius.</i>

118
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:12,785
<i>The always cool-headed Kikuchi. And...</i>

119
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:17,857
{\an8}<i>Shori Sato,</i>

120
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:20,726
{\an8}<i>who sings a solo about his mentor.</i>

121
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:27,066
The Johnny's classics are all in there.

122
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:29,969
What Mr. Johnny did...

123
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:31,470
What Mr. Johnny was trying...

124
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:34,340
His ideal image of Johnny's.

125
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:40,713
I've always strived to be that,
and that was expected of me.

126
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:49,322
<i>He wrote the lyrics to
"Show must go on" himself.</i>

127
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:05,972
<i>In order for Sexy Zone
to move on to the next stage,</i>

128
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:10,843
I have to put all of my past into this

129
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,645
and mark the end of this stage.

130
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:15,948
I think I need to do that.

131
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:18,384
Yeah.

132
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:23,122
Kind of like a fresh start.

133
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:30,262
{\an8}<i>The song that shows Sexy Zone's
readiness to go into the future.</i>

134
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,501
"GYUTTO"

135
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:38,237
"Gyutto!"

136
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:43,542
<i>Then, Matsushima joined them onstage.</i>

137
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:46,012
Matsushima's here!

138
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:48,047
Matsushima?

139
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:49,582
-I'm Matsushima.
-So!

140
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,584
-Is it really you?
-Matsushima.

141
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:56,455
<i>The five mark their
new start with "NOT FOUND."</i>

142
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:21,514
<i>The four continue,
and Matsushima wants to watch.</i>

143
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:25,651
This part is really good.

144
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:31,390
They're doing something they've never
done before on the center stage.

145
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:32,758
I think you should see.

146
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:40,733
"HOSHI NO AME"

147
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:56,248
<i>By the middle of the concert,</i>

148
00:11:56,315 --> 00:12:01,754
<i>#SZ_POPSTEP2020 was
the number one trending topic.</i>

149
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:09,028
<i>Then, at the end of
three days of online concerts.</i>

150
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:11,964
More than anything,

151
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:16,869
I'm glad he made this decision.

152
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:23,275
During his hiatus,
to make a single decision,

153
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:26,545
I'm sure we can't even imagine

154
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:29,281
the amount of pressure he was under.

155
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:36,255
His choice could have been
to leave Sexy Zone.

156
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:40,159
But among those many choices,

157
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:45,765
he chose to stand with us onstage,
together as five.

158
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:48,234
I'm very happy about that.

159
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:52,404
I want to use all my power

160
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:57,343
to continue protecting this group of five.

161
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:58,978
I feel that strongly.

162
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:05,251
I have these words for everyone.

163
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:07,820
We're enough.

164
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:15,928
"SORE DE IIYO"

165
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:42,321
I think it was really hard
for the four of them.

166
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:20,526
<i>And as the credits rolled...</i>

167
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:27,766
<i>the five of them stood by for "RUN,"</i>

168
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:31,971
<i>wearing those t-shirts.</i>

169
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:40,713
<i>Then...</i>

170
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:48,354
Are you okay?

171
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:52,625
You got overwhelmed?

172
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:55,794
Now you get overwhelmed?

173
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:05,771
<i>Finally, the final song
that has a special meaning to them.</i>

174
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:19,645
<i>In 2011,</i>

175
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:23,182
<i>they became the youngest group
to debut in Johnny's history.</i>

176
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:29,088
<i>They searched for their own place.</i>

177
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:32,191
-Oh!
-Whoa!

178
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:33,993
Did it take it?

179
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:34,927
Hold on!

180
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:38,864
{\an8}Hi, everyone! We're Sexy Zone!

181
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:42,201
That's good. It's really good.

182
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:46,071
Yay!

183
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:46,972
Woo!

184
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,974
-It's So!
-Yes.

185
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:54,079
We're SoMari!

186
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:10,396
-Okay!
-Yay!

187
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:11,697
Hey!

188
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:16,802
SEXY ZONE IN 10 YEARS...

189
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,037
Well...

190
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:23,275
To be a boys group whose music is played
not just in Japan, but the world...

191
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:27,079
I think I want to aim for that as a goal.

192
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:32,985
It will depend on how well
we can adapt to change.

193
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:37,589
An idol needs to have
the power of music and words

194
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:39,825
to deliver happiness to people.

195
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,761
It's like a mission, like our fate.

196
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:47,299
If that could naturally
come about in twenty years...

197
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:51,570
First, I hope we can become
nationally-renowned idols.

198
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:58,544
Well, of course, I think everyone has
dreams of their own for the group.

199
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,379
But ultimately,

200
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:05,217
I hope each one of us can be
happy and content.

201
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:09,655
That's all I need to be happy. Truly.

202
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,092
You can't force...

203
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:19,665
all five of us to stay together.

204
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:22,101
I don't think that's right.

205
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:24,970
All we can do is pray.

206
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,440
"Please."

207
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:35,047
"Please let everyone's dreams
be united until our 20th anniversary."

208
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:37,416
All I can do is pray.

209
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:48,026
Yes, please pray for us.

210
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:53,665
That Sexy Zone can reach its
20th anniversary as a five-man group.

211
00:18:56,335 --> 00:19:00,772
Picture that and pray hard.

212
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:09,047
I'd like to see it.

213
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,189
If I could be singing, I'd be happy.

214
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:20,659
I'd be really happy.

215
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:23,629
Yeah.

216
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,231
I like this group.

217
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,969
Looking at it objectively,

218
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:34,306
as long as the other bandmates...

219
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:40,145
are smiling and having fun, I'd be happy.

220
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:44,683
Rather than what I want for myself.

221
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,186
That's all I want, I guess.

222
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:49,755
More than our 20th anniversary.

223
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:52,858
If we can have fun,
or seem like we're having fun.

224
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,195
I like this group and everyone in it.

225
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,599
So that's it, I guess.

226
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:14,039
On December 2, Marius Yo went on
temporary hiatus due to ill health.

227
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:20,579
Shori Sato, Kento Nakajima, Fuma Kikuchi,
and So Matsushima continue with the group.

228
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:27,986
<i>Sexy Zone will continue
running into the future.</i>

229
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:34,760
{\an8}<i>On the next</i> RIDE ON TIME <i>is Snow Man.</i>

230
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,865
{\an8}<i>Using dance as their weapon.</i>

231
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:42,534
{\an8}<i>A look inside as they climb to success.</i>

232
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:44,202
I wonder how I look.

233
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:48,774
<i>After many years in Johnny's Jr,
they finally debuted.</i>

234
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:53,078
It's like we can finally start running.

235
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:56,415
<i>Dancing in the center at 17,
his true feelings.</i>

236
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:00,185
For the first time,

237
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:03,422
I felt like I wanted us to succeed.

238
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:04,323
CONCERT CANCELED

239
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:06,558
<i>It should have been their year to shine.</i>

240
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,796
It's unfortunate, or more of a shock.

241
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:14,866
{\an8}<i>The view they saw
after overcoming so many walls...</i>

242
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:15,934
