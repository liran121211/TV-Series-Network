Please accept my apology

00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:06,106
for my delayed introduction.

3
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:11,077
<i>It was July.</i>

4
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:14,581
<i>The idols from Kansai Johnny's
were putting on a skit show.</i>

5
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:18,418
{\an8}<i>KanJani8's You Yokoyama is directing.</i>

6

not put on the brakes.

9
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:30,997
{\an8}<i>The participating groups are Ae! group

13
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:44,711
It's good with cream and chocolate.

14
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:46,046
Hold on!

15
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:51,618
Many different generations have
come together, dreaming of stardom.

16
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,123
<i>That's the bond they share.</i>

17
00:00:57,924 --> 00:01:02,429
{\an8}What makes me most happy?
I'm happiest when Yokoyama laughs.

18
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:03,329
{\an8}MASAYA SANO (18)

19
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:06,933

23
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:43,603
{\an8}<i>over 70 idols born and raised

24

<i>The biggest reason
for their energy that night</i>

27
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:59,052
<i>was that they were starving
to get back on stage.</i>

28

{\an8}<i>And three of the Jr. units</i>

35
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:25,845
{\an8}<i>saw their hard-earned spots
in the limelight taken away.</i>

36
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:30,517
{\an8}Each day was like fumbling in the dark,
trying to make our way.

37
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:33,219
{\an8}We had no direction,
but took it day by day.

38
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:35,755
It was frustrating.

<i>To break out of that situation,</i>

41

<i>they would use their own
Osaka Shochikuza Theatre,</i>

42
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:49,002

<i>It's their first experience

56
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:26,606
<i>How can they reach fans
that they can't see?</i>

57
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,609
{\an8}You know,

58
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:32,779
{\an8}I already talked to Ae! group
and the Kansai Jr. kids.

59
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:36,015
{\an8}I told them this is going to be
a really tough fight.

60
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:37,884
Can we pump things up?!

61
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:39,586
{\an8}It's up to us!

62
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:40,720

{\an8}<i>at a studio on the outskirts of town.</i>

68
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:02,475
<i>At this time, many of the members
had other commitments,</i>

69
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:06,079
<i>so they only had two hours
with everyone together.</i>

70
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:10,250
<i>And yet...</i>

71
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:11,317
I'm sorry.

72
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:12,418
Where were you?

73
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:14,821
Sorry. I got lost.

74
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:17,257
{\an8}<i>One of the members is late.</i>

75
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,059
-This is unforgivable.
-I'm sorry.

76
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:21,928
He's done the unforgivable.

77
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:23,863
Make sure you film him, not us.

78
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,765
As a way of punishment.

79
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:28,001
There was a big road...

80
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:30,103
-Hurry up, Taisei!
-I'm sorry!

81
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,504
Sorry.

With this livestream,

86
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,156
we're discussing how we can work together

87
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,661
and get as many viewers

88
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:58,831

<i>In some ways,

100

Before the unit was formed,

101
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:40,273
Fukumoto failed to stand out

There are idols who do news shows, right?

105
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:58,191
I want to focus on that area.

106
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,796
Hello! I am Mr. Windshield Wipers.

107
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,632
I will wipe your heart.

108
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:12,305
<i>KanJani8's Yokoyama was the one
who noticed their personalities.</i>

109
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:21,414
<i>When their band angle was decided
and Ae! group was formed,</i>

110
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:24,784
<i>it was Fukumoto's
first time touching a bass.</i>

111
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:33,626
If your timing is off
during the hook, Taisei...

112
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:35,395
When you miss your note...

113
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,466
<i>Even now, he stays behind
for extra practice.</i>

114
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:45,872
When I heard Ae! group would be formed,

115
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:49,375
I was asked if I was ready to work
hard in entertainment.

116
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,878
I said yes and hung on for dear life.

117
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:56,716
I honestly don't remember much
from that time.

118
00:06:56,783 --> 00:07:00,019
I was just working desperately
the whole time.

119
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:05,057
You usually don't carry your instrument
around to interviews, but I did.

120
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:07,894
I kept playing while
I was being interviewed.

121
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,030
It was like I had to.

122
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:16,569
<i>The formation of the group</i>

123
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:19,806
<i>was a turning point for
the vocalist Suezawa as well.</i>

124
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:23,643
SEIYA SUEZAWA

125
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:28,548
<i>When we visited Shochikuza on this day,
Suezawa was in his own room.</i>

126
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:30,116
Excuse me.

127
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:31,684
Yes! You startled me.

128
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:34,253
You startled me!

129
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,621
You're alone.

130
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:37,423
It's my first time.

131
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:43,796
Shochiku has other green rooms
on the other side as well,

132
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:47,533
but this is my first time on this side
since joining Ae! group.

133
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,669
We all aspire to get over here.

134
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:53,306
The big room is for everyone
and these are for group members.

135
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:57,243
It's only for kids who are in a unit.

136
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,513
So it took about 10 years,
I guess 11 years.

137
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,882
It took 11 years to come to this side.

138
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:08,888
Making it here makes me realize
that I need to do an even better job.

139
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:10,890
Thank you.

140
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:13,793
<i>But right when they got their break,</i>

141
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:18,264
<i>their stage was taken away
by the COVID-19 pandemic.</i>

142
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:24,837
<i>Their desire to hurry back
to standing on stage grew stronger.</i>

After you get everything here,

146
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:37,116
you can synchronize it...

147
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,852
<i>Nervous energy fills the training room.</i>

148
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,721
Good morning.

149
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:43,189
Good morning, everyone.

150
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:44,490
Good morning.

151
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:49,462
<i>Yokoyama experienced performing
without an audience the day before.</i>

152
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:52,665
<i>He was keenly aware of the difficulty</i>

153
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:56,135
<i>of performing
without an audience's reaction.</i>

154
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,471
You have to go with a quick tempo,

155
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,873
or I think this is going to be tough.

156
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,742
A streamed skit

157
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:06,379
feels long if they don't think it's funny.

158
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:10,349
I think it's better to cut out
as much as possible.

159
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,318
It'll be easier to watch.

160
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,821
You don't really want to
make them think too hard.

161
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:18,424
Try to push things together.

162
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:20,426
Me and Masakado will...

163
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,295
<i>It is trial and error.</i>

164
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:26,966
Okay, so I'll do something,
and you're like, "That's pathetic."

165
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:29,569
Should Okumura's cue go
after Masakado's line?

166
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:30,803
-The cop bit?
-Yeah.

167
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:35,708
<i>Strange wigs are brought out
for Lil Kansai</i>

168
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:37,476
<i>who'll be sharing the stage.</i>

169
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:39,979

{\an8}KOTARO OKAZAKI (16)

171
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,082
{\an8}<i>They are idols,</i>

172
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:45,985
{\an8}<i>but their priority is
to entertain the audience.</i>

173
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:49,855
{\an8}<i>That is the tradition they pass down.</i>

174
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,361
You do skits to bring out
their personalities?

175
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,662
Yes, that's right.

176
00:09:56,729 --> 00:10:00,199
You know,
they can showcase their character.

177
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:03,102
Kansai Jr. kids will be there tomorrow.

178
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:07,440
I believe we need
to leverage their talents.

{\an8}AUGUST 11
FINAL REHEARSAL

180
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:11,877
{\an8}<i>It's the day of the show.</i>

181
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:18,684
<i>With Yokoyama away on work in Tokyo,
they run the final rehearsal without him.</i>

182
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:22,555
The members of Lil Kansai
are here today to audition.

183
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,156
Hello!

184
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:26,225
We're Lil Kansai!

185
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,760
It's nice to be here!

186
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,029
I'm the director, Okumura.

187
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:31,864
And I'm the director's...

188
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:33,065
Hey!

189
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:36,702
{\an8}<i>Something happened while
the smooth-talking Okumura</i>

190
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:39,739
{\an8}<i>and the inarticulate Oka</i>

191
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,708
<i>were doing their scene on stage.</i>

192
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:46,946
Okumura, Yoko's on the phone.

193
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,215
Hello? This is Okumura.

194
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:51,183
Good morning. Yes.

195
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,218
Yes.

196
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:57,390
<i>It was a phone call from Yokoyama
who was watching their rehearsal remotely.</i>

197
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:59,925
"That was wonderful, everyone."

198
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,228
Yes, thank you very much. Goodbye.

199
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:04,430
Thank you.

200
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,332
He said he wanted more energy.

201
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,635
My articulation is good,
so I can be more outgoing.

202
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:13,172
Yokoyama took the trouble to call.

203
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:15,975
<i>Meanwhile,</i>

204
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:19,912
<i>Ae! group received a message
from a different senior.</i>

205
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:24,517
<i>I'm thinking this is something
only Ae! group can do.</i>

206
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,853
{\an8}It was from KanJani8's Yasuda.

207
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:34,393
<i>It can be what makes people realize
how hard you're working.</i>

208
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:37,496
<i>What's best is to show them
you're having fun.</i>

209
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:39,265
<i>So have fun out there.</i>

210
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:40,266
Okay.

211
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:41,333
<i>Enjoy yourselves.</i>

212
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,234
-Yeah.
-Okay.

213
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:43,936
Thank you very much.

214
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:45,671
-That's great.
-Thank you.

215
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:46,906
Thank you very much.

216
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:52,078
<i>It's time for the big show.</i>

217
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:55,114
AE! GROUP IS ABOUT TO BRAKE?!

218
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:59,351
<i>They decide to show themselves
in good spirits.</i>

219
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:09,995
Is this supposed to be fun?

220
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:12,465
{\an8}Could you take off the sunglasses?

221
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:14,467
{\an8}<i>Ae! group is playing the part</i>

222
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:17,803
{\an8}<i>of idols who get big heads
after growing in popularity.</i>

223
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,606
Your outfits keep getting flashier.

224
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:23,309
I get recognized everywhere I go.

225
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,610
I'm this show's...

226
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:27,413
<i>Many different characters interact.</i>

227
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:31,283
{\an8}Please accept my apology
for my delayed introduction.

228
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,518
{\an8}It's fine.

229
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,488
That's so weak.

230
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:38,224
We'll take a strand of hair
for DNA analysis.

231
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,392
Just one? Please just take it all!

232
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:46,866
A dad can become a mom.

233
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:49,101
A mom can become a dad.

234
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:51,871
It's Mom! It's Dad!

235
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,439
-It's Mom!
-Hold on!

236
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,642

<i>The curtains finally close</i>

240
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:33,913
<i>on an emotional stage.</i>

241
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:37,149
I was reminded how much

242
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:39,919
I like being on stage.

243
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,987
I had the realization.

244
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:45,691
I'm glad I didn't give up.

245
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,261
I suddenly remembered my life a year ago.

246
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:54,300
Like the feeling of frantically searching
within myself for something.

247
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:57,436
Remembering that brought back something.

248
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:03,309
<i>Next is Lil Kansai.</i>

249
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:07,213

{\an8}<i>Ruku Toma may be the youngest,

Maybe in seven years.

00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:53,192

want to do it in five years.

Sorry, can you do it again?

274
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,077
I looked down.

275
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:14,280
Don't look at it!

276
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:15,547
Okay.

277
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:20,920
<i>Without an audience,
they don't know where to look,</i>

278
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:23,188
<i>and their eyes drift to the monitor.</i>

279
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:24,790
Okay.

280
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:30,162
<i>What's more, it was their first
time as the main act,</i>

281
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:32,698
<i>and it was their job to lead the kids.</i>

282

Guys, seriously don't be so lazy.

We'll pause at the dance.

286

{\an8}I'm scared to be the MC.

287
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:50,382
{\an8}Tens of thousands of people
will be watching. That's scary.

288
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,918
I've been underestimating the MC's role.

289
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,754

{\an8}What's this costume?

that only we can do and Naniwa can't.

302

-But they're so cool.
-It's really hard.

303
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:43,669
{\an8}I can clearly see that we're not as good.

00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,805
I'm learning how to play the piano now.

305
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:49,308
I want to play other instruments, too.

306
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:54,213
I want to be someone who can do anything.

307
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,683
They're doing it as a team.

{\an8}you know...

317
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:21,140
Even with the songs
to hype up the audience,

318
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,842
when we were just trainees in the back,

319
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:26,779
Jo would be like, "Get in front."

320
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:30,749
He'd come to the back
and tell us to go to the front.

321
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:36,655
I've always felt that
our seniors all want us to stand there.

<i>If everyone gets to shine,</i>

323

<i>Shimasaki and Nishimura

Remember how I told you
to bring the mic closer?

326
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:56,542
-Apparently it still sounds a bit fuzzy.
-Okay.

327
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:58,911
So just energetically yell, "Car!"

328
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:02,181
If it's a car, shout "Car!"
If it's a dog, shout "Dog!"

329
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,282
-For Charades?
-Yeah.

330
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:04,450
Just be loud.

331
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:06,018
As loud as you can.

332
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,553
If it's too quiet,

333
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:10,422
the audience might be like,
"What's he saying?"

334
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:13,292
You can be wrong,
or even yell, "I don't know!"

335
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:14,960
Just give a reaction.

336
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:17,663
Whatever happens, give it a lot of energy.

Want to change something?

340
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:38,517
Yeah, could I try hopping in to MC?

341
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:40,452
-Yeah, sure.
-You two go for it.

342
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:45,791
<i>There is meaning in consciously
challenging one's weaknesses.</i>

343
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:53,565
<i>These high school kids were starting
to face their role of being the main act.</i>

344
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:59,338
{\an8}AUG. 15
DAY OF THE KANSAI JOHNNY'S JR. SHOW

345
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:01,106
{\an8}<i>The big day arrives.</i>

346
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:09,781
<i>Lil Kansai was feeling
the enormous pressure.</i>

347
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:14,186
{\an8}We've never had
this level of responsibility before.

348
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:19,691
{\an8}But we're the oldest ones this time...

349
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:26,632
And we also need to make sure
the little ones stand out, too.

350
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:28,867
We're all one group.

351
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:31,236
We want to get through this together

352
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:36,241
and become an even better group.

353
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:41,747
{\an8}<i>The little idols</i>

354
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:43,549

What's next?

365
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:40,639
That's hard.

366
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:43,375
Try making a nice circle like this.

367
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:44,743
-<i>Takoyaki</i>!
-Correct!

368
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:51,383
"KANSAI ISLAND"

369
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:54,686
<i>This tradition has been passed down</i>

370
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:58,523
<i>so that anyone can shine on stage.</i>

371
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:03,295
Thank you!

372
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:06,665

375
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:12,537
It was awesome.

376
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,106
It was really great.

377
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:16,642
I was moved.

378
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:18,744
-I mean...
-Really?

379
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,012
I went all out.

380
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:23,048
-So I'm just exhausted.
-Yeah, true.

381
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:29,621
<i>This summer, they've successfully
overcome another obstacle.</i>

382
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,456
Good work!

383
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:35,360
{\an8}<i>On the next</i> RIDE ON TIME<i>,
it's Johnnys' WEST.</i>

384
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:36,495
{\an8}This is tough.

385
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:38,563
{\an8}<i>Their challenge</i>

386
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,699
{\an8}<i>is a midsummer livestream concert.</i>

387
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,069
{\an8}<i>They strive to go further.</i>

388
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:47,272
{\an8}Sometimes I just think to myself,
"Man, I'm alive."

389
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:50,042
{\an8}<i>What pushed them</i>

390
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:52,778
{\an8}<i>was the grief of losing a big opportunity.</i>

391
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,781
{\an8}It's the first time I cried over work.

392
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:58,717
{\an8}Ain't it great?!

393
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:01,320
{\an8}<i>They will get their revenge in Osaka.</i>
