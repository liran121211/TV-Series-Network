-Should we line up?
-Yes, please.

6

-Hurry. Just include them.
-It's kind of macho.

7
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:21,321
No, we don't need to include them.

8
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:22,822
I don't want that.

9
00:00:22,889 --> 00:00:26,793
Sorry, but you're in it a little bit.

The same age...

82
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:44,170
We're always tired.

83
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:47,507
We're old men.

00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:52,745
{\an8}AGE 14, PASSED AUDITION

85
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:55,748
{\an8}<i>When Okada was 14,</i>

86
00:06:55,815 --> 00:07:01,287
{\an8}<i>he participated in an audition held as
part of a TV show from his hometown Osaka.</i>

87
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:06,125
<i>After passing, he stayed in Tokyo.</i>

88
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:12,098
<i>The only thing he had
in his bag was a hair dryer.</i>

89
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:17,904
I debuted when I was 14.

90
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:20,673
I didn't have money.

91
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:23,810
Soba noodles were the cheapest...

92
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:28,014
They were the cheapest, so that was good.

93
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,250
I had to eat something,
so I just ate soba noodles.

94
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:34,454
I ate the same thing for three years.
Nothing else.

95
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:38,124
I didn't have extra clothes
and didn't buy them.

96
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:43,696
So I think everyone remembers
that I always wore overalls.

97
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:46,766
It was white,
but I wore it until it turned black.

98
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,768
Everyone talks about it.

99
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:54,807
But the truth is I didn't have money,
so I couldn't buy anything else.

100
00:07:56,943 --> 00:08:03,015
<i>That's why he looked for his own weapon
to work in the industry for a long time.</i>

101
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:08,888
<i>He chose to be an action star himself.</i>

102
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:13,426
{\an8}<i>He appeared in a number of movies
and historical dramas.</i>

103
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:19,999
In Japan, actors prefer
to be in subculture movies.

104
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:23,669
No one wants to be mainstream.
You're cooler in subculture stuff.

105
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:29,041
Movies that make you go,
"Bam! Now this is entertainment"...

106
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:32,745
There weren't that many of them back then.

107
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:36,649
But I'm part of Johnny's
which is all about entertainment.

108
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:39,352
So I went that route,

109
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,655
and I became a geeky actor
who only gets offers

110
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:44,891
to play military men and samurai.

111
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,960
That's what I wanted though.

112
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:50,496
{\an8}Let's go aggressive.

113
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:53,466
{\an8}Let's film something crazy.

114
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,067
{\an8}-Go aggressive.
-Yeah.

115
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:58,304
<i>In the film that was shot last year...</i>

116
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,013
<i>he put his body on the line.</i>

117
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:12,552
<i>That's why he has one thing
on his mind right now.</i>

118
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:19,392
Considering the impact of
the pandemic and also my age...

119
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:26,132
I'm trying my best to keep up with
the changes brought on by the pandemic.

120
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:32,772
But at age 39, I feel a gap
regular people wouldn't understand.

121
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:37,443
I feel like I could challenge myself
to do something more.

122
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,979
I feel like I've always been

123
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:42,982
struggling like that.

124
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:49,088
I don't know if I was crazy
or just sucked-in enough.

125
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:52,391
Could I have been alone?

126
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:56,429
When you want something great,
you really want to be lonely.

127
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:58,798
I mean, you'll become lonely.

128
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:05,004
That kind of conflict within me about
making things grows bigger and bigger.

129
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:08,908
I wonder if I push myself hard enough.

130
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:12,945
I have a lot of concerns like that.

131
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:17,350
What's the aspect ratio?

132
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,285
It's 16:9.

133
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:20,720
Oh, okay.

134
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:25,591
You can even shoot a music video with it.

00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:29,949
You can only be like that
for this period of time.

171
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:33,953
So when I see it and feel it,

172
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:37,490
I feel really glad that
I'm been doing this program.

173
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:38,791
It's nice.

174
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:42,762
Oh, Teacher. Thank you very much.

175
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:44,497
Thank you very much.

176
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:46,599
Say hi to everyone for me.

177
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:47,800
Okay. Thank you.

178
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,068
Thank you so much.

179
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:56,308
{\an8}<i>Morita joined the agency when he was 13.</i>

180
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:59,411
{\an8}<i>He was mischievous even after he debuted</i>

181
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:03,649
{\an8}<i>and often gave the older team a hard time.</i>

182
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:13,025
The way we thought was different
from the older three.

183
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,529
We didn't think about anything

184
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:19,431
and we just wanted to have fun.

185
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:21,667
So there was a huge gap there.

186
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,103
{\an8}STAGEPLAY "ARAJINN" REHEARSAL

187
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,572
{\an8}<i>But when he was in his late twenties,</i>

188
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,109
{\an8}<i>Morita realized the fun of acting onstage.</i>

189
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:34,613
<i>By building experience
in the rehearsal room,</i>

190
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,715
<i>he improved himself.</i>

191
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,827
<i>This day, he was choreographing
all by himself.</i>

192
00:13:56,502 --> 00:14:00,072
<i>A choreographer who knew him
before his debut said this.</i>

193
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:04,210
The first time I worked with V6,

194
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:07,713
he was the most accurate
with moves and positions.

195
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:09,915
It was Go.

196
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,886
He may not look it,
he does things the most properly.

197
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:15,855
-That's why he's interesting.
-True.

198
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:19,992
He always watches rehearsal videos.

199
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:22,228
-He does, right?
-Yes, always.

200
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:30,035
<i>This is the kind of work
that Morita is not good at.</i>

201
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:31,871
Enough!

202
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,908
That's too many!

203
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,646
-It's taking so long today.
-It's the same for everyone.

204
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,681
It's so long.

205
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:43,782
Just five more.

206
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,620
You're taking pictures endlessly.

207
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:50,990
I want a little more.

208
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:53,893
I can't.

209
00:14:56,228 --> 00:15:00,099
You seem to save your energy
during photo shoots.

210
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:02,134
That's rude.

211
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:07,106
You're saving your energy
the most in the group.

212
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:09,141
You don't understand at all.

213
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,042
Yeah?

214
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:12,845
That's not good for
the production of the show.

215
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:13,879
Really.

216
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:17,650
I look like I'm saving my energy, huh?
Yeah, no surprise there.

217
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:20,920
I don't actually know
how other members are,

218
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:23,455
but I guess we care about
different things.

219
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:26,692
I like acting onstage...

220
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:31,630
So I do it.

221
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:34,900
It's not like I save
my energy for everything.

222
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:36,502
It's about balance.

223
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:41,941
The balance of myself
and the overall balance.

224
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:45,311
Members like Nagano
wouldn't say anything, but I assume

225
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:48,113
he's got stuff on his mind.

226
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:53,218
But sometimes there's a lot of
meaning in things that aren't said.

227
00:15:55,254 --> 00:16:00,759
That's something that I think
other people should be aware of.

228
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:19,411
<i>During a rehearsal...</i>

229
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:28,287
A lot of people are here for hours
so we have to ventilate.

230
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:30,756
We're focused,
so we can't give you orders.

231
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:34,460
So you guys should take the lead
and watch the clock

232
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:37,496
and ventilate every 10 or 15 minutes.

233
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:41,000
Let's have a meeting
and open the doors every hour.

234
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:44,470
<i>Since the state of emergency last year,</i>

235
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:48,874
<i>Miyake has been writing this
at the end of his every blog post.</i>

236
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:53,679
{\an8}TO HEALTHCARE WORKERS...

237
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:58,650
{\an8}<i>For the people at the frontline
in this pandemic every day.</i>

238
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:05,224
{\an8}THANK YOU ALL, WHO TAKE RISKS
TO SUPPORT OUR DAILY LIVES.

239
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,026
Not just the healthcare workers...

240
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,095
It's not just healthcare workers.

241
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:13,932
There are so many people

242
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:17,403
who are supporting our daily lives.

243
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:21,040
There really are so many people.

244
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:24,243
Like those who are working
at grocery stores,

245
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:28,781
and nursing homes and banks.

246
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:33,652
I want everyone...

247
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:37,256
to think of them.

248
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:41,860
But I don't want to be pushy about it.

249
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:48,200
So I simply write it
to express my appreciation.

250
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:52,171
Readers can take it as they like.

251
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:55,407
That's all.

252
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:59,078
I forgot how "PINEAPPLE" went.

253
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:11,824
<i>This is how the oldest member,
Sakamoto, sees Miyake.</i>

254
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:18,130
Of the six of us, Ken is the one
who thinks about a lot of things. Really.

255
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:21,867
-About the group.
-Oh, yeah?

256
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:25,204
About each member... Surprisingly.

257
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,674
He'll be embarrassed
and won't admit it though.

258
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:34,413
{\an8}<i>He joined the agency when he was 13,</i>

259
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,684
{\an8}<i>And even before his debut,
his looks drew attention.</i>

260
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:45,324
{\an8}<i>GoKen Combi with Morita</i>

261
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:50,195
{\an8}<i>held their own concert, which was
unusual for Johnny's Jr. at the time</i>

262
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:51,830
{\an8}<i>and they became popular.</i>

263
00:18:55,534 --> 00:19:02,274
<i>10 years after his debut, Miyake began to
learn sign language on his own,</i>

264
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:05,410
<i>and became a navigator
in a show about sign language.</i>

265
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,912
SIGN LANGUAGE FOR EVERYONE

266
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,347
<i>It all started...</i>

267
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:12,885
{\an8}<i>when he met a certain fan
at a handshake event</i>

268
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:15,053
{\an8}<i>during their 10th anniversary tour.</i>

269
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:24,563
I shook hands with fans one at a time...

270
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:27,466
It was really like in a day or in an hour...

271
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,801
Like 8,000 fans a day.

272
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:32,804
And the security in the back
was like "Go, go."

273
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:36,041
So it was really like a flash
with each fan.

274
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:39,178
And that's when I saw...

275
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:42,214
this Deaf girl.

276
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:45,951
And she talked to me a lot
in sign language,

277
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:49,388
but I didn't know what to say back.

278
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:52,891
I couldn't even say anything.

279
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:56,094
And she was gone.

280
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:58,864
How should I say... The fact that

281
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:03,569
I couldn't say anything to the fan
at all is very regrettable for me,

282
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:06,738
and that had always stuck with me.

283
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:09,575
So I decided to learn it,

284
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:13,579
and I attended a workshop that
the ward was hosting for three years.

285
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:15,681
From that point,

286
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:20,552
everyone including Deaf people...

287
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:27,426
I began to want to make the things
we offer to be enjoyable for everyone.

288
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:30,829
Our DVDs basically have...

289
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:35,400
For all on-stage banter and everything,

290
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:39,671
we have subtitles that you can turn on.

291
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:44,376
I think that really made them...

292
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:47,579
enjoyable for everyone.

293
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:06,098
Oh, hi!

294
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:09,368
Cute! What is the dog's name?

295
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:10,502
-Vinnie.
-Vinnie?

296
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:11,403
Vinnie.

297
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,171
So cute!

298
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:14,506
Vinnie, sit.

299
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:16,241
Oh, good doggie!

300
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:18,877
Let me smell your paw pads.

301
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:22,714
Do they smell?

302
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:25,117
Well, when they get tired...

303
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:26,752
Oh, stinks! A burnt smell.

304
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:29,788
Yeah, as they get tired,
that smell gets stronger.

305
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:31,056
What are you doing?

306
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,090
It's true!

307
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:33,558
What are you two doing?

308
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,696
<i>For 25 years,</i>

309
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:42,234
<i>they have been together.</i>

310
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:52,844
{\an8}<i>In the next episode, they start preparing
for their 25th-anniversary online show.</i>

311
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:02,688
{\an8}<i>The older three who have been
supporting the group.</i>

312
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:08,260
{\an8}I'm able to work, in large part
because of V6.

313
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:12,097
{\an8}I can't wait to see
how it's going to change.

314
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:15,434
{\an8}"There are six of you
and you're that boring?"
