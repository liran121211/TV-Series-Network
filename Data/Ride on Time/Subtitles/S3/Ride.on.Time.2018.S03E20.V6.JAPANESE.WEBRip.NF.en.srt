1
00:00:02,102 --> 00:00:06,740
-The chair dance is for the concert?
-That's right. Yes.

2
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:11,044
They tend to play around like that.

3
00:00:12,245 --> 00:00:13,246
We're working.

4
00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:16,149
If you talk too seriously,
you'll waste your time.

5
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:17,951
Look at that.

6
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,587
This isn't the right atmosphere
for a meeting.

7
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:24,224
Oh, jeez.

8
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:27,961
Morita!

9
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:35,702
They were the most
mischievous in the group.

10
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:03,930
<i>This is documentary series</i> RIDE ON TIME.

11
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:08,301

00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,009
{\an8}<i>In 1995,</i>

14
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:19,546
{\an8}<i>this is where V6 debuted.</i>

15
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:29,589
{\an8}<i>Since then, they've always held
their milestone concerts here.</i>

{\an8}2005 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF DEBUT

{\an8}2015 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF DEBUT

{\an8}<i>And for the 25th-anniversary
livestream concert,</i>

20
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:04,991
{\an8}<i>V6 took the stage here again.</i>

21
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:06,359
{\an8}YOYOGI FIRST GYMNASIUM

22
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:09,229
{\an8}<i>In the first song,</i>

23
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:13,466
{\an8}<i>they intentionally appeared
on an empty stage in different styles.</i>

24
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:28,515
{\an8}<i>They used the strengths of streaming well.</i>

25
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:38,491
"HANE"

26
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:42,695
{\an8}<i>The six did their best to
bring their current selves to the fans.</i>

27
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:03,249
{\an8}-Good morning.
-Good morning.

28
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:05,084
{\an8}STAGE DIRECTION MEETING

29
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:08,821
{\an8}To be honest, I don't want
people to see the chairs...

30
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,326
{\an8}A lift will be here
and you'll come down on it.

31
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:17,730
<i>On this day, they first talked about</i>

32
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:23,036
<i>how to take advantage of a livestream
combined with prerecorded footage.</i>

33
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,776
I like the dance at the chorus.
How the six of you walk...

00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:33,613
{\an8}V6 KEN MIYAKE (41)

35
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,783
{\an8}What do you think?
I thought they'd hold microphones.

36
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:39,819
{\an8}-But I thought it was nice without them.
-Oh, yeah?

37
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,589
{\an8}It's better to show
that it's pre-recorded...

38
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:43,756
{\an8}Cooler without them.

39
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:46,993
{\an8}-Then, no mics for "Right Now."
-Okay, I got it.

40
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:50,630
{\an8}<i>And about which song they should perform</i>

41
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:53,533
{\an8}<i>in the exclusive ending
for their fan club members.</i>

42
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,601
{\an8}YOSHIHIKO INOHARA

43
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:56,703
Yes, after the last song...

44
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:59,439
-"Full Circle"?
-Right.

45
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,309
"Full Circle"? Well, I'm happy with that.

46
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:06,279
Ken said, "That'd be a good ending."

47
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:07,480
{\an8}In "Full Circle,"

48
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:11,584
{\an8}maybe we could walk to the center...

49
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:15,188
I want something we can only do online...

50
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:20,159
A slightly mature and sexy ending.

51
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:21,494
An ending, yeah.

52
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:29,168
<i>"Full Circle" contains
the ideas of the six members.</i>

53
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,838
OCTOBER

54
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:14,580
{\an8}REHEARSALS CONTINUE EVERY DAY
IN PARALLEL WITH MEETINGS

55
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:25,525
<i>This time, a special visual effect
was to be added to this song as well.</i>

56
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:39,238
<i>This was to show that the members
were taking the fans' thoughts to heart.</i>

57
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,310
<i>Getting the stars on my side now</i>

58
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:46,612
Maybe a single star can shine.

59
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:51,050
It'd be nice if the star doesn't just pass
but gets involved with people.

60
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:55,855
When the six of us put out our hands,
words will come down,

61
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:58,224
and they turn out to be fans' wishes.

62
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:02,562
Their wishes come down onto our hands

63
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:06,699
and it suggests that we'll make them true.

64
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,836
-I see. Yeah.
-That's the message.

65
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:14,240
{\an8}A SAMPLE OF THE EFFECTS WAS MADE

66
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:23,349
Also, the heart blasts like boom
and that's it, right?

67
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:26,285
It's sad to see the heart just fade away.

68
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:27,854
And the font.

69
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:30,189
The font isn't right.

70
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:32,792
This is too formal.

71
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,460
Something like handwriting...

72
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:37,997
Right. Handwriting is better.
Like in letters.

73
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:45,037
It's the same as the difference between
a typed letter and a handwritten letter.

74
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,709
Even if they both say the same thing.

75
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:51,377
That's right.

76
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,248
<i>It ended up like this.</i>

77
00:06:55,982 --> 00:07:02,955
"ARU HI NEGAI GA KANATTANDA"

78
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:43,029
{\an8}-Good morning.
-Good morning.

79
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:44,964
Can I hear the song?

80
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:46,065
Sure.

81
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,266
Play it.

82
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:55,408
{\an8}THE NEW SONG THAT THE MEMBERS
ASKED KREVA TO WRITE, "CLEAR"

83
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:02,248
{\an8}I CAN'T SEE MYSELF, BUT IN YOUR EYES

84
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:07,386
{\an8}REFLECTS BRILLIANCE AND THAT'S A MIRROR

85
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:12,525
{\an8}HOW THE UNEXPRESSED FEELINGS ARE GIVEN

86
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:17,597
{\an8}MY MIND BECOMES CLEAR NOW

87
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:22,735
{\an8}I SEE MY PAST SELF
UNMISTAKABLY MY OLD SELF

88
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:27,807
{\an8}SEEMS LIKE A STRANGER
FELT LIKE SPACETIME DISTORTED

89
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:32,178
{\an8}ARE THERE TWO ME'S?
I STAND STILL

90
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:36,315
{\an8}THE WORLD IS COLORFUL TODAY AS ALWAYS
I MUST START MOVING AGAIN SOON

91
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:39,552
{\an8}BUT I'M STILL A LITTLE BLUE

92
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:43,789
{\an8}I THOUGHT I WAS HOLDING THE WHEEL

93
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:50,062
{\an8}THAT EXPERIENCE IS NON-RETURNABLE
I CAN'T EVEN MOVE ON LIKE THIS

94
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:53,599
{\an8}SO I'LL START ALL OVER AGAIN

95
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:58,204
{\an8}I CAN CHANGE MYSELF
IF I CONNECT WITH YOU AND SEIZE THE DAY

96
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,542
The lyrics turned out so cool.

97
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:05,344
Oh, these, right? Aren't they awesome?

98
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:08,714
-What did you think?
-How can anyone think of these words?

99
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:10,416
I'm so impressed.

100
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:16,188
This part right here. We really like it.

101
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:20,359
{\an8}It's exactly like how we are now.

102
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:23,095
{\an8}I WON'T HAVE A DEFIANT ATTITUDE

103
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:25,831
{\an8}I'LL OPEN THE DOOR TO NEW POSSIBILITIES

104
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:29,268
{\an8}EVEN IF WE CHANGE OUR FORMS
OUR PRIDE WILL NEVER BE LOST

105
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:35,708
<i>And on the same day,
Morita checked stage settings.</i>

106
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:39,445
Starting halfway through...

107
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:47,520
If we make it like this...

108
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,057
If we do that, it's pointless.

109
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,393
-Can you sit closer again?
-One more time.

110
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:01,367
Take a seat.

111
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:10,643
I like this better.

112
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:12,745
Okay. I see.

113
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:22,722
{\an8}MORITA MADE THE MEMBERS CLOSER

114
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:25,391
{\an8}MIYAKE POSTS "I CONSTANTLY ASK MYSELF"

115
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,394
{\an8}<i>We asked Miyake what he meant.</i>

116
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:33,132
In this day and age, people say

117
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:38,371
it's never too late to start something
no matter how old you are.

118
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:39,639
But...

119
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:44,043
For men, their thirties and forties

120
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:49,849
are sort of a turning point, so if I...

121
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:54,587
If I want to move on to the next stage,

122
00:10:55,955 --> 00:11:00,326
I can't help but feel that
my forties is my last chance.

123
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:01,927
I think we all feel that.

124
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,996
What do we do from now?

125
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:07,400
Who are we living for?

126
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:10,569
Do we live for someone else?
Or for our own selves?

127
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:13,673
I've been thinking about it
since I was 30.

128
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:18,811
I think about it as
a separate thing from the six of us.

129
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:23,382
I bet the others
individually think about it, too

130
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:26,686
about how they want to
live their own lives.

131
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:32,058
That's what I meant when I wrote,
"I constantly ask myself."

132
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:33,459
What do I want to do?

133
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:37,630
{\an8}2020 SEPTEMBER 29
"VS ARASHI" DRESSING ROOM

134
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:38,998
{\an8}V6 MEMBERS

135
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:41,033
{\an8}Good morning.

136
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,334
{\an8}Let's do our best.

137
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:43,636
{\an8}Good morning.

138
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:46,906
Oh, jeez.

139
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:49,709
<i>In September,</i>

140
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:53,679
<i>Okada started to point
his own camera to the members.</i>

141
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:58,451
I thought,
"Let's capture things only I can."

142
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:01,520
I'm the only one who's allowed to do that.

143
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:07,093
I can only take terrible expressions.

144
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:09,729
-Only you can take them.
-It's hard.

145
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:16,635
<i>The six have spent 25 years together.</i>

146
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:22,575
What was that?

147
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:24,043
Is it blurry?

148
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,416
No, it's not blurry at all.

149
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:42,661
Okay, let's do it with the music.
Please play "TL."

150
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:53,172
<i>For this livestream show,
they dared to take on a great challenge.</i>

151
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:04,717
<i>Performing their song "TL"
without vocals, just by dancing.</i>

152
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:17,129
Okay...

153
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:19,165
In the structure,

154
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:25,971
I want to show V6's dance
as a work of art.

155
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:30,509
So maybe like a water burst
or the water goes back, I don't know.

156
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:35,114
I want something to make people feel
it's moved up another gear

157
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:38,751
just when they think
it peaked at the dance.

158
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:42,688
The water should be put in
at the right time or it'll be slippery.

159
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:45,391
{\an8}-That could ruin it.
-It'll be very slippery.

160
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:47,927
{\an8}When you know it'll be slippery,

161
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:51,363
{\an8}you can't dance as hard as you can.

162
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,666
Another thing that I'm wondering about

163
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:56,735
is whether you should wear shoes
or go barefoot.

164
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:58,070
Barefoot.

165
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:00,139
-Are you sure?
-I think it's better.

166
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,108
You mean we'll be barefoot before that?

167
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,710
No, that's why...

168
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:07,613
-We'll take them off.
-Remove and align them?

169
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,249
-We don't need that bit.
-No?

170
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:12,952
No, we don't need it.

171
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,820
That's what my father taught me.

172
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:15,788
Good manners.

173
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,656
Like full of energy...

174
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:22,494
<i>During the meeting, another thing that
the members were very particular about</i>

175
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:24,830
<i>was the structure of their visual book.</i>

176
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:28,334
<i>Whether or not to include
the members' interviews.</i>

177
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:35,107
Do you really want to include them?

178
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:39,578
Because it's not a pamphlet, right?

179
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:42,147
It's a visual book.

180
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:47,052
I thought people can feel "25 years"
more without words.

181
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:48,787
I'm sorry, but I think

182
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:54,627
what we have in mind for this one is not
an image of us that's been fabricated.

183
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:58,597
We want something more raw,
something that's more revealing.

184
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:02,301
I want to choose photos that show

185
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:05,938
how a group of real people made it happen.

186
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:08,574
Like pictures of us sweating.

187
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:13,779
In other words, we want to shoot photos
that prove what we've done.

188
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:18,918
What does it take
to be an idol for 25 years?

189
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:22,554
There must be something to it.

190
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:26,025
Okada started taking pictures,

191
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:30,095
but I think what we need are
photos taken from that kind of distance.

192
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:36,435
He's at a distance that no one else
can be at because he's a member.

193
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:38,270
So those photos are special.

194
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:39,805
Why not use those photos?

195
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,608
These photos when you're taken...

196
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:46,679
It's like, "Please make me look nice."

197
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:49,348
So the atmosphere's not the same.

198
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:51,850
Too close.

199
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,190
<i>Just the way they are now.</i>

200
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:03,929
{\an8}COSTUME MEETING
MUSIC STATION DRESSING ROOM

201
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:07,800
{\an8}<i>The members were also particular
about their costumes.</i>

202
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:10,903
It's dark and
because it'd look great with the lights,

203
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,039
metallic colors would be nice,
although it's flashy.

204
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:18,777
I want you to get rid of the notion
that stage costumes equals sequins.

205
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:23,482
What kind of image do you have
of idols in sparkly clothes?

206
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:26,318
-Yeah. What kind of image do you have?
-I see.

207
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:28,821
You're right. It's hard to answer that.

208
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:32,224
Nice! That's a nice point.

209
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:36,595
{\an8}I know you've worn so many costumes,

210
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:40,699
but I thought this kind of fabric
would look great.

211
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:43,002
I think you've never worn this kind.

212
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:45,471
This fabric has just been made.

213
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:50,242
<i>They found a fabric
that is both gorgeous and mature.</i>

214
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:55,848
For example, if we come out in that coat,

215
00:16:55,914 --> 00:17:01,487
and then take it off
to show those gold outfits,

216
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:02,821
it'll be very dynamic.

217
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:07,359
How long is it gonna be? Like 10 songs?

218
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:08,694
It's quite long.

219
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:10,529
That part is the longest.

220
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,266
It'll be better if we can have
three different styles...

221
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,835
How about putting on a jacket
at some point?

222
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:18,137
You can do that.

223
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,839
That'll be dynamic like Ken said,

224
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:25,277
and if we put it back on at some point,
we'll look different again.

225
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:26,311
That's true.

226
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,514
Or just do without it.

227
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,382
Without changing.

228
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:31,884
-No change?
-No change.

229
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,952
It'll work if the quality is high.

230
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:36,422
You're right. That's true.

231
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:38,223
I think it'll work, too.

232
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:41,060
But in case it doesn't,
let's make a jacket.

233
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:43,262
As emergency insurance.

234
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:46,365
If you think that'll work, let's do it.

235
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:49,234
Then, let's spend our budget on it.

236
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:50,602
Budget?

237
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:52,171
Talking about money?

238
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,809
But it's important.
If we can spend money on it...

239
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:00,379
-That's it from me. Thank you.
-Thank you.

240
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:04,083
{\an8}FITTING SESSION

241
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:06,685
{\an8}<i>Their stage costumes are being completed.</i>

242
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:11,924
I'm picky about my silhouette. Sorry.

243
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:17,796
<i>Then, they'll change into
pure white costumes.</i>

244
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:26,205
Getting wet... You'll definitely get wet.

245
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:32,344
<i>In contrast, "TL" which they'll perform
just by dancing is in all black.</i>

246
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:38,317
<i>Okada...</i>

247
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:50,496
<i>was struggling with the costume
on the empty stage at the beginning.</i>

248
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:54,299
<i>What they want to show people
is the way they are now.</i>

249
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,105
I kind of want...

250
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:04,009
something that is not fake.

251
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,112
If we're gonna stand there.

252
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:10,983
I want to make it look like
we're just our normal selves

253
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:15,120
gathering there to perform
and I want that feeling a little bit more,

254
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:18,991
which means it's not a matter of pattern
or anything like that.

255
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:20,025
Is it too much?

256
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:23,395
<i>With those thoughts...</i>

257
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:26,298
<i>they gathered here.</i>

258
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:53,559
Inocchi, could you stand in the center?

259
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,795
<i>25 years ago,</i>

260
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,398
<i>this is where they debuted.</i>

261
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:01,066
You're perfect now. Wait...

262
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:05,637
Ken.

263
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:07,940
Stand in the center.

264
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:10,108
Your hair's... We need the stylist.

265
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:13,912
Are you shooting now?

266
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:15,647
We don't need pictures of me.

267
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:17,649
Hiroshi!

268
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,652
In the middle.

269
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:26,124
<i>Okada kept taking pictures of the members,
just the way they were.</i>

270
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:33,599
Director Okada.
Could you do that later, Director?

271
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:35,133
Could you do this later?

272
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,070
Next time, I'll give you
as much time as you need.

273
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:38,971
Sorry.

274
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:41,940
{\an8}OCTOBER 19
FILMING THE LIVESTREAM SHOW

275
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:45,277
{\an8}<i>Finally, they were about to start filming.</i>

276
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:46,979
It looks cold!

277
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:48,981
It's a bit cold.

278
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:52,284
Okay, remove the steps on the side.

279
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,353
Okay, start rolling.

280
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:56,688
From the beginning.

281
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:07,532
I'm sorry.

282
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:09,401
Are you okay?

283
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:11,103
I'm okay.

284
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:18,176
-Cut!
-Okay, cut.

285
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:20,712
It was just me, sorry.

286
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,489
Oh, it's cold!

287
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:34,559
It's like a hangout for old men.

their 25th-anniversary show.</i>

290
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:57,549
{\an8}We can only do a show like this
this year because of the pandemic.

291
