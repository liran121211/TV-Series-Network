00:00:02,202 --> 00:00:03,937
Please begin!

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:07,841
<i>On this day, the choreography
for this group's new song was shown.</i>

3
00:00:07,907 --> 00:00:09,909
Sensei, I'm excited!

4
00:00:09,976 --> 00:00:12,078
Been a while since we did your dance.

5
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:14,280
-I want this exact.
-So it's this way?

6
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:15,515
{\an8}That part's fine.

7
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:18,118
{\an8}<i>The idol group, Snow Man.</i>

8
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:19,319
{\an8}This way.

9
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:21,654
{\an8}Do this four times.

10
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:25,992
Try to keep your left hand wide and loose.

11
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:28,061
And we want the head going this way.

12
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:31,064
We want the left hand around here.

13
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:32,265
-Okay!
-This way.

14
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:34,801
I think it's tilted. Like this.

15
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:37,103
This here shifts.

16
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,571
The style is like this.

17
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:42,709
<i>Then within a matter of minutes...</i>

18
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:06,833
<i>They've nearly mastered the choreography.</i>

19
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,735
It's cooler when we're in sync.

20
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:11,304
We are Snow Man!

21
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:12,372
-Yay!
-Yay!

22
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,930
<i>This is documentary series</i> RIDE ON TIME.

23
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:42,168
Let's get this started!

24
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:48,174
{\an8}<i>In January 2020,
Snow Man made their long-awaited debut.</i>

25
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:56,382
<i>Their greatest weapons
are their acrobatic moves</i>

26
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,918
<i>and outstandingly high dance skills.</i>

27
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:06,359
<i>Their debut single which
had been awaiting release, "D.D.,"</i>

28
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:08,428
<i>sold over a million copies.</i>

29
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:17,770
{\an8}<i>With those polished skills,</i>

30
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:22,142
{\an8}<i>they're now trying to make their way
to the forefront of their generation.</i>

31
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:28,548
{\an8}Good evening!

32
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:32,652
{\an8}<i>Although rare for a first year group,
their namesake show had begun.</i>

33
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:40,760
<i>The longest residing member has 15 years
of experience as a Johnny's Jr.</i>

34
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:45,031
<i>They had finally grasped their debut.</i>

35
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,736
{\an8}Things have changed a lot.

36
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,705
{\an8}There are times I find myself thinking,

37
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:55,942
{\an8}"Oh, I've made my debut."

38
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:57,510
Sometimes.

39
00:02:58,244 --> 00:03:02,815
From here on,
I think we have infinite possibilities.

40
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:07,253
The things people say are impossible
or a bit difficult...

41
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,156
I kind of want to challenge those.

42
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:12,926
What awesome cherry blossoms!

43
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:17,297
<i>Everyone had been imagining
a spectacular first year like that.</i>

44
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,339
{\an8}Good morning!

45
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:29,943
{\an8}<i>In March, their introductory debut concert
had been decided,</i>

46
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:31,911
{\an8}<i>and their rehearsals had begun.</i>

47
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:35,381
Oh, there's a camera!

48
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:37,183
Huh?

49
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,618
<i>However...</i>

50
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:41,020
Hey, sorry, everyone.

51
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:43,423
Fujii has been leading until today,

52
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:46,826
but for various reasons
there's been a personnel change...

53
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:47,794
...to HiHi Jets.

54
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:49,662
You're kidding!

55
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,265
-No way! Seriously?
-Stolen by our juniors!

56
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:58,171
<i>One of their choreography staff had
been reassigned to their juniors' group.</i>

57
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:01,140
<i>But this is their reaction.</i>

58
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:04,344
It's the one from YouTube.

59
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:16,456
{\an8}<i>Their debut concert</i>

60
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:19,859
{\an8}<i>was to consist of 14 performances
at three arenas.</i>

61
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:25,798
{\an8}<i>In addition, visits to Bangkok,
Singapore, Jakarta,</i>

62
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:29,435
{\an8}<i>and Taipei had been scheduled
for an Asian tour.</i>

64
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:40,580
{\an8}<i>Hikaru Iwamoto is the group's leader,
and also choreographs the dances at times.</i>

65
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,349
{\an8}TATSUYA FUKAZAWA (28)

66
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:47,553
{\an8}<i>Tatsuya Fukazawa is trusted by the others
as the group's organizer</i>

67
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,322
{\an8}<i>and has a comical personality.</i>

68
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:54,560
Oh, baby, baby!

69
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:57,497
{\an8}DAISUKE SAKUMA (28)

70
00:04:57,563 --> 00:05:00,733
{\an8}<i>Daisuke Sakuma is the group's mood maker.</i>

71
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:05,004
You go like this and if you do that...

72
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:08,074
<i>His acrobatic skills are guaranteed.</i>

73
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,643
Think of it as pulling in the legs.

74
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,045
{\an8}RYOHEI ABE (27)

75
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:15,948
{\an8}<i>Ryohei Abe holds
a meteorologist certification</i>

{\an8}<i>and is a regular on quiz shows.</i>

77
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:21,521
{\an8}Well... I was able to win.

78
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:25,892
But honestly, playing with
the legends of the quiz show world

79
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:30,997
and winning quizzes like that
makes me really happy.

80
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,633
{\an8}<i>Shota Watanabe.</i>

81
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:37,837
{\an8}<i>He is such a beauty enthusiast,
women's magazines with his cover...</i>

82
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,472
{\an8}<i>have sold out.</i>

83
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,474
{\an8}The highlight of this song

84
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:45,244
{\an8}is our lip choreography and leg movements!

85
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:46,145
{\an8}Time's up!

86
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,448
Was that 10 seconds?

87
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,583
{\an8}RYOTA MIYADATE (27)

88
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:54,854
{\an8}<i>Ryota Miyadate performs

{\an8}<i>He is irreplaceable in Japanese theatrics.</i>

90
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:05,665
<i>And then there's the three
who just joined last year.</i>

91
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:12,438
{\an8}<i>Ren Meguro, who also models
for fashion magazines,</i>

{\an8}REN MEGURO (23)

00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:17,977
Two, two, three, four,

95
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,645
five, six, seven!

96
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:23,983
-It's all spirit.
-Backflips are about spirit. 98% spirit.

97
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:27,620
<i>Then we have...</i>

98
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:28,921
What happened?!

99
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:34,861
<i>...the one who always spreads laughter
in the group, Koji Mukai.</i>

100

<i>Coming from Kansai Johnny's Jr.,</i>

101
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:42,101
<i>he moved to Tokyo alone.</i>

102
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:48,674
<i>I feel like there's a lot of meaning</i>

103
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:52,645
in being able to return to
Osaka as part of Snow Man.

104
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:55,548
I want to be told, "Koji you're amazing!"

105
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:58,851
{\an8}RAUL (AGE 17)

106

107
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:08,961
<i>He joined Snow Man at 15 and was
suddenly entrusted with the center role.</i>

108
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:12,999
<i>He never shies away from
his seniors or veteran staff either.</i>

109
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:20,940
Now, immediately change T-shirts
and disinfect with alcohol.

110
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:26,412
<i>When the idea was raised to create a film
that would show fans their appreciation...</i>

111
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:29,816
If we wanna show our appreciation,

112
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:33,152
I think we can express it
through our song.

113
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:36,889
Like as an approach.
As one way to convey it, yeah.

114
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:43,496
<i>The debut concert's stage had dynamically
scaled up from their Johnny's Jr. days.</i>

115
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:49,569
<i>The giant monitor was to be lit up
with the latest video technology.</i>

116
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:54,173
<i>However, during this time,</i>

117
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,743
<i>the effects of COVID-19
were already creeping up on them.</i>

118
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,650
Earlier this morning,
Mr. Abe said the state of emergency...

119
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:07,854
-He declared it?
-It could be declared on the 13th...

120
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,589
Oh, he's deciding on the 13th?

121
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:10,490
Right.

122
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,526
<i>Amid the situation,</i>

123
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:17,129
<i>was this day's filming of
the music video for their new song.</i>

124
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:21,300
-Thank you for being here.
-Likewise, thank you.

125
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:22,702
Okay, please begin.

126
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:23,669
Please begin!

127
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:32,745
{\an8}<i>This is their second single,
"KISSIN' MY LIPS."</i>

128
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:46,025
<i>They were supposed to introduce this song
at their debut concert.</i>

129
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,101
-Koji.
-Yes?

130
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:57,970
You may be early in the interlude, Koji.

131
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:00,039
-Ah, the rap?
-Yeah.

132
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:03,142
And one, two, three, four!

133
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,211
-Oh, it's this!
-It's probably this.

134
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,680
-It might be a bit stiff.
-Ah.

135
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:08,581
I see now.

136
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:14,754
<i>For Snow Man's stage,
dancing is their lifeline.</i>

137
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,056
-This?
-Yeah.

138
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:24,130
<i>At this moment, the members
had already been notified of the news.</i>

139

SNOW MAN'S 14 PERFORMANCES

142
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:42,648
OF THEIR FIRST ASIAN TOUR
AFTER THEIR CD DEBUT...

143
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:46,385
Well, it's unfortunate,
or more of a shock.

144
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:48,154
It was our debut concert...

145
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,990
Well, in that sense,
I really wanted to do it.

146
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:53,626
Well, I was seriously saddened by it.

147
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:56,195
My mom was even planning
to come watch too.

148
00:09:56,796 --> 00:10:00,499
Well, more than feeling sorry,
I feel sad about it.

149
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:03,769
<i>On the other hand, Miyadate...</i>

150
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,176
I feel like this is typical for Snow Man.

151
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:17,883
Because Snow Man has experienced a lot
and overcome many tough times,

152
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:25,024
and now we've sort of hit
yet another even bigger wall.

153
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:29,261
If we can't break through it,

154
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:32,231
even if we make our debut in many things,

155
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:40,906
I think... we'll be defeated.

156
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:44,410
-You see this as a test?
-That's right.

157
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:51,350
<i>And so, they entered their long,
stay-at-home life.</i>

158
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:56,589
<i>In their important debut year,
they had to come to a halt.</i>

how he felt at the time.</i>

169
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:43,402
{\an8}I've thought about giving up
on many occasions.

170
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:45,404
{\an8}I've thought about giving up a lot.

171
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:48,407
All of my previous groups
broke up in the end,

172
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:51,877
so I've always wanted
to protect this group.

173
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:54,113
JANUARY 2019

174
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:58,417
<i>However, the tide turned
in January last year.</i>

175
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:05,391
A few years ago, I would really never
have believed a day like this would come.

176
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:11,764
{\an8}Takizawa Kabuki ZERO.

177
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:17,269
"HIRARI TO SAKURA"

178
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:20,639
<i>On the stage known as the gates
to success for a Jr.,</i>

179
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:22,775
<i>Snow Man was chosen as the leads.</i>

180
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,381
"KUMIKYOKU"

181
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,192
TAKIZAWA KABUKI
"GOEMON ZERO"

182
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,427
Goemon!

183
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:44,463
Do not move!

184
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:48,834
Say what?!

185
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:55,374
"TAIKO"

186
00:12:56,275 --> 00:13:00,679
<i>The show blends various kinds
of Japanese culture.</i>

187
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,485
My wig!

188
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:08,220
We're wasting time.

189
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:13,092
<i>That stage polished them
both physically and mentally...</i>

190
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:21,200
{\an8}<i>and Snow Man made their debut
with nine members.</i>

191
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:25,070
{\an8}<i>They were looking forward
to that show this year as well.</i>

192
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:31,043
{\an8}JANUARY 2020 DEBUT

193
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:36,015
<i>The performance had been canceled,</i>

194
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:40,319
<i>but then it was relabeled
as</i> Takizawa Kabuki ZERO 2020 the Movie<i>,</i>

195
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,755
<i>and was decided to be released as a film.</i>

196
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,057
TAKIZAWA KABUKI ZERO 2020 THE MOVIE

197
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:49,428
BASED OFF THE SAME STAGE PERFORMANCE,
TO BE RELEASED WITHIN THE YEAR

198
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:51,497
-Morning!
-Good morning!

199
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:55,935
Good morning!

200
00:13:56,535 --> 00:14:02,408
<i>In July, the members finally gathered
after ending a long stay-at-home period.</i>

201
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,047
He's grown so much!

202
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:10,216
Just vertically, so I'm doing a bit of...

203
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:11,517
No, horizontally too!

204
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:13,219
You need to work out.

205
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:16,755
I was finally able to meet everyone
and see their faces.

206
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:19,592
That alone made me happy.

207
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:23,095
{\an8}I think that was probably our time

208
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:26,298
{\an8}to build up our own strengths.

209
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:33,539
<i>This day's lesson was for "Kumikyoku"
where they dance for nearly nine minutes.</i>

210
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:41,380
Opposite of where you're pulled back...

211
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:44,884
Um, your left shoulder blade
goes the other way.

212
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,986
There's a bit of a mutual pull and...

213
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:53,158
<i>Due to the stay-at-home break,
their bodies won't move as freely.</i>

214
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:56,795
Like this... Yeah, that's good!

215
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:01,901
<i>On top of that,
their face masks obstruct their breathing.</i>

216
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:05,604
It gets hard to breathe halfway through.

217
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:10,075
-Can we start?
-Please!

218
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:12,945
<i>They decide to have a run-through.</i>

219
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,216
-Let's do it for real then.
-Okay.

220
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:05,831
Okay.

221
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:09,268
That was dangerous!
I slipped on someone's sweat.

222
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:10,602
You okay?

223
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:14,206
Should we do it again?

224
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:16,442
Man, we have to bust our butt again.

225
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:24,683
Well, I'm surprised
at how much I can't move.

226
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,153
My body's screaming in pain.

227
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,824
I'm surprised how I was able
to move this much a year ago.

228
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:34,493
I feel like I have someone else's body.

229
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,330
That's how panicked I felt, yeah.

230
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,301
<i>It's about to be a tough battle.</i>

231
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:45,237
Don't forget that we decided
the numbers today.

232
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:46,939
Okay.

233
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,010
<i>Late July.</i>

234
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:53,045
SHINBASHI ENBUJO THEATRE

235
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:58,183
{\an8}<i>The filming had begun
for</i> Takizawa Kabuki ZERO 2020 the Movie.

236
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,160
Everyone good? On standby?

237
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,596
Ready, begin!

238
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:18,871
<i>This sword battle performed
by all nine of them is "Kyukenshi."</i>

239
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:24,676
<i>The members' expressions
and moves are captured more dynamically.</i>

240
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:31,350
Cut!

241
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:35,888
{\an8}-Isn't fatigue building?
-Well, lactic acid sure builds up.

242
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:38,123
-We're going on next.
-Yes.

243
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,158
See you.

244
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:42,861
<i>And this is the video that was filmed...</i>

245
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:51,470
"KYUKENSHI"

246
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:18,263
<i>And this jump...</i>

247
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:24,503
{\an8}<i>Ten days before filming,</i>

248
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:27,639
{\an8}<i>Sakuma was here rehearsing.</i>

249
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:33,312
DECEMBER 2018

250
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:35,247
This is amazing!

251
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,951
<i>Acrobatic moves
are his ultimate specialty.</i>

252
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:42,054
Try to feel how it goes once.

253
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:47,025
<i>For Sakuma, there was a contraption
he had to master this time.</i>

254
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,629
-Whoa!
-Like that just now.

255
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:53,332
Try not to kick it yourself.

256
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:57,903
If you try to kick it, the timing
will be off and you'll miss the lift.

257
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:04,309
<i>If the timing isn't correct,
it could lead to serious injuries.</i>

258
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,679
-I'll try it.
-Okay.

259
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:09,815
All right!

260
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:14,153
-Here I go!
-Okay.

261
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:19,858
You'll hurt your knees...

262
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:21,927
It completely got me.

263
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:25,631
You mean like this?

264
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:26,832
Yeah, like that.

265
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:32,271
Here I go.

266
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:35,741
I see!

267
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:39,411
Ugh, I don't understand! What is this?

268
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:40,812
Here I go.

269
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:51,823
Hm, I still don't understand.
I can't grasp it at all.

270
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:54,960
-Try it a few times to get the feel of it.
-True.

271
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:59,264
<i>As Miyadate watches over...</i>

272
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:03,468
Okay!

273
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:06,171
<i>He succeeds on his thirteenth try.</i>

274
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:07,973
That one was great!

275
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,541
That one was nice!

276
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:11,543
Yes.

277
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:12,878
<i>One more time.</i>

278
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:15,547
-Please, go ahead.
-Here I go.

279
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:21,153
-Yeah!
-Nice!

280
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,454
Yay.

281
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:24,223
Is it easier if we lift it?

282
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:25,257
I think so.

283
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:27,659
It depends on how it feels for you.

284
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:32,698
Like, whatever you do in acrobatics
is always scary at first, you know.

285
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:37,703
And as you get used to doing it,
your fear starts to fade.

286
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:41,940
To overcome your fear
is probably most important.

287
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:48,080
Well, in my case, I happen
to be able to dance and do acrobatics,

288
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:49,881
but I really suck at sports.

289
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:53,585
I'm a slow runner.
I can't swim freestyle either.

290
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,288
Tomorrow, I'll be walking like this.

291
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:05,564
<i>Each one of the members has
been polishing their own unique skills.</i>

292
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:15,173
<i>At last, the day to film
that one performance has come.</i>

293
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,375
JULY

294
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:20,479
<i>This is the highlight of Takizawa Kabuki,
"Fukkin-daiko."</i>

295
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:25,384
<i>With only their abs to hold them up,</i>

296
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,819
<i>they have to continuously
beat</i> taiko <i>drums.</i>

297
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,324
Roll camera.

298
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:33,225
Rolling.

299
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:34,860
Action!

300
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:44,736
<i>The torturous moment has begun.</i>

301
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:50,008
{\an8}<i>On the next episode,
the filming reaches its climax.</i>

302
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,912
{\an8}<i>Raul displays a chilling performance.</i>

303
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,581
{\an8}Can you do the same moves?

304
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:57,649
{\an8}No, I can't.

305
00:21:57,716 --> 00:22:00,952
{\an8}Age is kind of like a title...

306
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,122
{\an8}<i>And to the climax.</i>

307
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:05,724
{\an8}Izo!

308
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:08,860
{\an8}I'm climbing up.

309
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:10,862
{\an8}I wonder how I look.
