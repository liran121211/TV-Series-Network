NOVEMBER 2020
ENOSHIMA

2
00:00:15,615 --> 00:00:18,184
-We made it to Enoshima.
-We did.

3
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:23,089
Matsuku? Where are you?

4
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:26,693
At the train station?

5
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:33,566
I'm at the ticket gate.

6
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,736
No, I'm walking.

7
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:41,207
There you are.

8
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,477
He looks so shady.

9
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,148
Like he's up to no good.

10
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:55,188
-Good morning.
-Morning.

11
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:57,190
How was Shime's driving?

12
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:58,525
-It was fine.
-Really?

13
00:00:58,591 --> 00:00:59,793
Yes, it was smooth.

14
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:02,362
-I messed up the highway exit though.
-Yeah?

15
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:05,732
{\an8}-Was it around February?
-Yeah.

16
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:10,637
{\an8}<i>They are Travis Japan's
Ryuya Shimekake and Kaito Matsukura.</i>

17
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:13,573
{\an8}OCTOBER 2020

18
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:18,111
{\an8}<i>Until a few days ago, they were standing
on the Shinbashi Enbujo Theatre stage</i>

19
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:24,217
{\an8}<i>in a stage play starring
the seven members of Travis Japan.</i>

20
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:32,492
{\an8}I'll give you a signal
if it looks like you'll hit Noel.

21
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:35,728
Okay, thanks.

22
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,665
-Seriously, thanks.
-Don't mention it.

23
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:42,435
-It's about helping each other.
-So cool.

24
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,672
I didn't make my quick change.

25
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:49,209
The costume has a zipper,

26
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,510
and it got jammed.

27
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:53,613
<i>I had to go out without fixing it.</i>

28
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:59,619
FINAL REHEARSAL

29
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:02,722
Then Shime was like, "Just look forward!"

30
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:15,869
-He was <i>actually</i> cool.
-Screw you!

31
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:17,437
You jerk.

32
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:25,712
<i>This was their brief moment of respite
after finishing their run of 28 shows.</i>

33
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:28,748
It's cold.

34
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,217
It's seriously cold.

35
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:33,186
-What is <i>nishoku-don</i>?
-Let's see.

36
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:35,822
It's whitebait prepared
two ways over rice.

37
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:37,590
What is <i>sanshoku-don</i> then?

38
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,527
It's a <i>nishoku-don</i>
with minced tuna and green onion.

39
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:41,861
For real?

40
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:44,197
We'll take two <i>nishoku-don</i> and...

41
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:46,566
-And two boiled whitebait rice bowls?
-Yes.

42
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:47,567
Sorry, also...

43
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:49,702
Could I have the sashimi platter?

44
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:52,338
The platter? Thank you.

45
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:55,241
You're having fun at least.

46
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:59,212
-Thank you for this meal.
-Time to dig in.

47
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:07,020
It's really good.

48
00:03:07,086 --> 00:03:11,524
The whitebait is so springy and tender.

49
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:14,227
Inside my mouth it's like...

50
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:17,964
It's like <i>shu, shu, shu, shu</i>.

51
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,166
-Why are you stuttering?
-I'm cold.

52
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:21,768
<i>Shu, shu, shu, shu...</i>

53
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:23,469
Can whitebait be springy?

54
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,406
-Isn't that for soba noodles?
-Right.

55
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:27,774
Food reviews are hard.

56
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,342
Yes, they are.

57
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:54,000

SEPTEMBER 2020

59
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:03,176
<i>Rehearsals for Travis Japan's
stage play have begun.</i>

60
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,415
-That's so high.
-Be careful.

61
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:14,554
<i>The trampoline acrobatic stunts
can send them over four meters in the air.</i>

62
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:17,090
It's crazy scary.

63
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:17,991
For real?

64
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:20,126
Because that's so high.

65
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:23,496
It's scarier with high ceilings.

66
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:31,237
{\an8}<i>The stage play</i> Torajya Ninjapan
<i>is an entertainment show</i>

67

{\an8}<i>that was created for Travis Japan in 2019.</i>

68
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,743
{\an8}FIRST STARRING PERFORMANCE

69
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:42,782
<i>While they instantly sold out every show,</i>

70
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:48,521
<i>the trampoline, tap dancing, and action
led to a physically-demanding performance</i>

71
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:51,057
<i>that was more rigorous than anticipated.</i>

72
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:52,659
I tend to turn.

73
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:54,661
Okay, okay.

74
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:02,602
<i>They play the roles of ninja
with superhuman abilities.</i>

75
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:03,903
<i>In the climax,</i>

76
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,940
<i>they were asked to try out
some astounding moves.</i>

77
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:11,911
We want to get on the world stage.

78
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,448
While we're not the best in Japan,

79
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:20,386
we want our play to reach that status.

80
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:23,589
We don't just want the play to blow up.

81
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,893
We want to make sure that we grow as well,

82
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:30,496
so we can ultimately
perform overseas together.

83
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:37,403
<i>So they stand on this legendary stage

00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:50,683
<i>Naturally, they are asked to make it
an even better show than before.</i>

86
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:57,757
Five, six, seven, eight,

87
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:01,060
nine, ten.

88
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:04,130
-Shizuya, did you do one extra?
-Sorry.

89
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:06,632
One more time.

90
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:13,272
Yeah, that's tiring. You guys okay?

91
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:18,611
We're doing stuff that even the best
trampolinists in Japan can't do.

92
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:23,082
So try to focus.
It's going to take a lot of stamina.

93
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:25,251
Ready? Go.

94
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,855
Sorry!

95
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,493
We just have to practice.

96
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:36,162
Jump on two. One, two, three.

97
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:42,135
{\an8}<i>The leader Kaito Miyachika ardently

You two can go like one, two, three.

99
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:48,608
Okay, good.

100
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:51,177
You can do a flip from there.

101
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:53,846
Make the left twist sharper...

102
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:57,917
{\an8}<i>Then there is Noel Kawashima, the oldest.</i>

103
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:02,188
{\an8}<i>He pushes the group
with his detailed, constructive feedback.</i>

104
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:08,094
{\an8}One of Travis' best qualities is that
when they come up against a problem,

105
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:12,632
{\an8}they talk things over together
and give suggestions as a group.

106
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:16,903
{\an8}You get a wonderful sense of teamwork

107
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:20,907
{\an8}that you'd be hard-pressed to find,
even in team sports.

108
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:23,810
{\an8}That is a big help to me.

{\an8}<i>Five of the initial
nine members still remain.</i>

112
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:37,723
I've been with Noel since
before we became a group.

113
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:40,793
-We didn't get along at first.
-Really?

114
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,596
I didn't talk to him at all,
even backstage.

115
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:44,831
Really?

116
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:48,401
I don't think he was a fan of me either.

117
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:52,271
It didn't help that I realized
I had a problem with him.

118
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:55,541
I don't know, Shizuya and I
didn't get along,

119
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:59,145
and Shime and I didn't hit it off at all.

120
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:00,546
I hated him.

121
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:03,349
I didn't like Noel or Shime much either.

122
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:04,250
I see.

123
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,351
At the start.

124
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:07,954
Noel was really prickly, too.

125
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,957
He wasn't the nice
and friendly guy he is today.

126
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:13,092
I'd be like, "What's his problem?"

127
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:18,030
I was really touchy back then.

128
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:20,700
I was like, if I can do it,
everyone should.

129
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:25,805
It was really messed up
the way I judged everyone.

130
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:31,511
<i>Kawashima was working
while still attending school,</i>

131
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:37,316
<i>so there was a time when he was as hard
on others as he was on himself.</i>

132
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:40,653
-This is so nostalgic.
-Yeah?

133
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,522
It's super nostalgic.

134
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,791
This is it.

135
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:49,462
I started here in junior high,

136
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,230
and attended for ten years.

137
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:54,867
This right here.

138
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:58,704
That building over there with four floors...

139
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:05,611
That's my university's research facility
for the political science department.

140
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:12,151
<i>Back then, he frequented the office
of his professor who was mentoring him.</i>

141
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:15,955
I think this was it.

142
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:18,891
This brings back memories.

143
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:22,228
It's the only one with curtain rails.

144
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:27,300
It's something my professor left behind.

145
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:33,072
<i>While everyone searched for jobs,</i>

146
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:36,642
<i>he had doubts regarding
his future as an idol.</i>

147
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:41,047
It's okay to have
different values and personalities.

148
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:44,317
You can talk differently
and speak different languages.

149
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:51,691
University was bringing
all sorts of things into one place.

150
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:55,194
When you meet all kinds of people,

151
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:59,131
you start thinking about
how interesting other jobs can be.

152
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:04,270
I have friends who are pharmacists...
They have all sorts of professions.

153
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:09,942
I actually want to do it all.
I want to experience them all.

154
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:19,452
<i>From the piano to linguistics,
acrobatics to intensive studies,</i>

155
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:23,022
<i>he took on anything that interested him.</i>

156
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:28,394
Good morning,
good afternoon, good evening.

157
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:33,499
<i>Thinking about what he could do
during the quarantine,</i>

158
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:37,937
<i>he uploaded sign language
tutorial videos every day for 50 days.</i>

159
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:45,244
<i>He is relied upon to emcee
and handle the press.</i>

160
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:48,614
Its fun meter is just so, so, so high.

161
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:52,184
Last year, we went from zero to one.

162
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:57,123
This was a piece in which we worked hard
to turn that one into a ten or a hundred.

163
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:59,692
We're sure that you're going to love it.

164
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,327
Could you give me a smile?

165
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:06,866
<i>However, all the weapons he mastered</i>

166
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:11,103
<i>sometimes make it hard to see
Kawashima's human-side.</i>

167
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:14,173
Okay, please turn your gaze back this way.

168
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,374
Nice and soft.

169
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,577
I heard you can't force a smile.

170
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:20,312
Yeah, I'm so bad at it.

171
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:23,282
I'm terrible at it.

172
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,785
It's so hard for me to smile for pictures.

173
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:30,923
Sometimes we wonder
when we'll be able to see the real Noel.

174
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,459
Yeah.

175
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:40,332
I probably have all these weapons
because I'm scared to show the real me.

176
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,867
So, you're afraid.

177
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:44,036
It's because I'm weak.

178
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:48,541
Part of me feels that I can't be an idol
if I'm too natural.

179
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,809
What will happen?

180
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:50,910
Well...

181
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:59,485
Part of me feels that I can't be an idol
if I'm too natural.

182
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,753
What will happen?

183
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,854
Well...

184
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,694
-People will think I'm just crazy.
-Yeah?

185
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:14,266
-You mean like dangerous?
-No.

186
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:17,403
People don't understand me.

187
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:22,875
I feel like people like idols because

188
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,178
they feel a sense of closeness,

189
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:31,751
or there's a part of them
that grabs their interest.

190
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:36,489
And I probably don't have
a single thing like that.

191
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:40,793
I'm just not confident in myself.

192
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,927
Seriously.

193
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:47,166
I wasn't great at anything.

194
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:49,368
With work, with my studies.

195
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:54,073
I worked hard to try to be the best,
but I couldn't pick one thing.

196
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:57,843
I was too scared to face failure if I did.

197
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:04,950
That's why I want people to look
at the facade I've crafted,

198
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:06,719
but it gets peeled away.

199
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,921
-It gets peeled back?
-Yeah.

200
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:11,123
It's those guys who peeled it back.

201
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:13,692
So I'm incredibly grateful.

202
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:15,060
I see.

203
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:19,799
<i>There were nine initial members.</i>

204
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:26,038
<i>One by one they would quit,
until one day they were down to five.</i>

205
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:31,143
<i>Some believed the group would dissolve
before they even had a chance to debut.</i>

206
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:34,346
<i>Then what happened was...</i>

207
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:38,317
my dad stopped me.

208
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:39,351
-Really?
-Yeah.

209
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:40,753
-From quitting?
-Yeah.

210
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:45,191
When we got down to five of us,

211
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:49,662
my dad invited me to dinner, so I went.

212
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:55,367
I wasn't really giving off vibes that
I was going to quit or anything.

213
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:58,771
Anyway, my dad was like...

214
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:06,178
going down this path wasn't a mistake,

215
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:12,952
and that I should keep going because there
were definitely good things in my future.

216
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:16,021
Yeah.

217
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,859
{\an8}Part of it for me was...

218
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:20,926
{\an8}KAITO NAKAMURA

219
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:24,830
{\an8}...there weren't many fans.

220
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:26,332
-Really?
-Yeah.

221
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:32,538
But the ones we did have still
cheered me on so enthusiastically.

222
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:35,374
My first fan letter made me so happy.

223
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:36,842
-You remember it?
-Yeah.

224
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:41,046
It said, "You caught my interest
so I've started watching."

225
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:44,016
I still think I have it at home.

226
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:50,389
I think it was someone
from Fukui prefecture.

227
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:58,397
<i>During this time
of uncertainty for the five,</i>

228
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:00,366
<i>2017 offered a turning point.</i>

229
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:04,837
<i>It was the addition of Kaito Matsukura
and Genta Matsuda.</i>

230
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:08,707
<i>Much was expected of their dance skills.</i>

231
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:17,850
{\an8}<i>However, their dance skills weren't
the only thing they brought to the group.</i>

232
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,786
Okay, ready?

233
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:21,954
Let's see.

234
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:23,555
No! Why are you cheating?

235
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:25,024
You're so cheap.

236
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,492
He's a cheater.

237
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:27,726
Okay, ready?

238
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:29,228
<i>Chàng gē</i>.

239
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:30,896
I know that one...

240
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:32,598
"Sing a song"!

241
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:34,900
-That was awesome.
-Okay.

242
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:36,835
<i>Rèn shi</i>.

243
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:37,836
Got it!

244
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:41,307
<i>Bāng zhù</i>.

245
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:45,544
-Wow.
-Don't be so hesitant.

246
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,712
<i>Pǎo bù</i>!

247
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,147
Wait, I know this one.

248
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:50,716
<i>Pǎo bù</i>!

249
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,117
What's the definition?

250
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:54,787
Go at the same time.

251
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:55,821
Ready?

252
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:57,189
-"To run."
-"Running."

253
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,058
They're both correct.

254
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,392
We'll split it 50-50.

255
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,727
No!

256
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:07,132
After MatsuMatsu joined,

257
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,269
we all started
communicating with each other.

258
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:15,007
Also, the two of them take the initiative.

259
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:18,177
They goof off and set the tone.

260
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:23,415
It's like...

261
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:26,552
Like...

262
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:29,555
Light entered the group.

263
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:31,623
For real.

264
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:35,627
It was pretty dark
when it was the five of us.

265
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:37,363
Really?

266
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:42,001
Genta was the one.

267
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:47,373
He was the one who really
broke me out of my shell.

268
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:55,748
When I was trying
to look all cool and manly,

269
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:59,852
he'd share an embarrassing story about me.

270
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:02,554
At first I was like, "Stop it!"

271
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:05,024
"Stop it, I worked hard to craft this!"

272
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,825
Is what I thought...

273
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:10,029
but it was so freeing to take it off.

274
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:15,034
I was so grateful when I realized that.

275
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:16,935
It's all thanks to him.

276
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:19,705
Were you scared?

277
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:21,440
Not at all.

278
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:23,308
{\an8}GENTA MATSUDA (21)

279
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:27,679
{\an8}Even if he got mad,
I thought I'd just tease him more.

280
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:35,654
I think he wanted to loosen up,
but his position demanded maturity,

281
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:40,526
which is why Noel felt so liberated
after peeling that back.

282
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:44,863
Then everyone could ease up
and expand their horizons.

283
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,865
After I took Noel's shell

284
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,802
and broke him out,

285
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:52,538
I realized everyone would change.

286
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:04,249
Ow.

287
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:10,289
It hurts.

288
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:14,426
This doesn't ease the pain.

289
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:16,028
I mean, it does but...

290
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,729
-It slows inflammation.
-Yeah?

291
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:22,901
You still need to take care of it yourself
by stretching and soaking in a bath.

292
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:25,170
This will just help you heal faster.

293
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:26,939
Thanks, you're a lifesaver.

294
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:28,574
It won't hurt for a while,

295
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,111
but the injury hasn't healed,
so try not to move too much.

296
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:33,579
Be careful.

297
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:35,080
Thanks.

298
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:40,586
There was a chance it may not
have been this current lineup.

299
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:41,954
Yeah.

300
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:44,289
I probably would've quit.

301
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:45,824
-Really?
-Probably.

302
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:47,092
I wonder.

303
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:50,762
Before we became seven,
I thought about quitting.

304
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:54,533
I thought about quitting even after.

305
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:57,536
I don't know.

306
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,838
Although, when they joined,

307
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,575
I thought I'd really try
because this could be it.

308
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:08,547
I thought if this lineup didn't work out,
we'd be finished.

309
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:17,122
<i>They would be taking on
another new challenge this time.</i>

310
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:43,415
<i>They would try to run up both sides
of a rotating wall from a trampoline.</i>

311
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:48,420
<i>It would be a performance that would
require all their stamina and skill</i>

312
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:51,356
<i>to draw people into a fantasy world.</i>

313
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:58,363
Crap.

314
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:07,406
One, two, three. One, two, three.

315
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:10,242
You five are jumping.

316
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:13,579
-Go!
-Go!

317
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,581
Ready?

318
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:28,927
Get ready.

319
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:31,096
Okay, now!

320
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:35,634
Hold on. Crap!

321
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:37,202
This is insane!

322
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:38,637
It's so hard!

323
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:45,210
-Kaito.
-Oh my gosh.

324
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:47,079
You have to jump the longest.

325
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:48,347
I'm going to die.

326
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:56,488
<i>"If you're not going to try,
it doesn't matter which path you take."</i>

327
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:02,861
<i>Those are the words
my professor shared with me.</i>

328
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:06,832
Whatever path I choose to take,

329
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:12,271
if I don't find or try to find
something that excites me

330
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:15,674
or something that really drives me...

331
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:19,878
If I'm just doing it
for the sake of doing something...

332
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:27,085
then it doesn't matter if it's
in entertainment or another job.

333
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:33,759
Regardless of whatever I choose,
I won't be able to enjoy my life.

334
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:39,564
<i>So why not try and see what happens?</i>

335
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:52,144
{\an8}<i>Next time, they attempt a new dance.</i>

336
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:59,351
{\an8}<i>The man they all admire
handles the choreography.</i>

337
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:01,553
{\an8}TOMOYUKI YARA

338
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,456

339
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:06,591
{\an8}Learning and doing aren't the same.

340

341
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:14,066
