{\an8}<i>The day of their 25th-anniversary show.</i>

00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:21,421
<i>As the six held hands,
they welcomed the moment.</i>

5
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:24,084
<i>This is documentary series</i> RIDE ON TIME.

6
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:27,020
{\an8}Okay, this way.

{\an8}<i>A video shooting for the livestream show.</i>

00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:36,463
{\an8}<i>They arrived at the place
where they debuted 25 years ago.</i>

10
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:39,132
<i>The Yoyogi First Gymnasium.</i>

11

{\an8}YOYOGI NATIONAL STADIUM FIRST GYMNASIUM

12
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:49,075
When they see the venue,
I bet they'll get excited.

13
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:50,810
Yeah, they will.

14
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:56,716
<i>They initially planned
to tour the country,</i>

15
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,718
<i>but gave up due to the pandemic.</i>

16
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,855
<i>They decided to do
a no-audience, livestream concert.</i>

17
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:05,058
We've been rehearsing
and we've finally come this far.

18
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:10,096
We were feeling how everyone felt
as we walked all this way.

19
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:11,431
That's right.

20
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:13,933
Let's do our best until the end.

22
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:20,607
{\an8}<i>On this day, they filmed the most
demanding dance performance.</i>

23
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,811
All right, members. It's time to rehearse.

24
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:32,418
<i>They began to walk through it
one last time.</i>

25
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:38,224
Come out and stop.

26
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:41,060
Okay, that's it. We'll stop right there.

27
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:58,478
Okay. Stop right there. Yes.

28
00:02:58,545 --> 00:02:59,712
That's good. Yes.

29
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:03,850
Members, when you're ready,
please get into the water.

30
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:05,785
I see.

31
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,025
It looks cold.

32
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:14,394
It's kind of cold.

33
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,995
It's quite deep.

34
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:17,197
It's deep and cold.

35
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:19,566
It's deep and cold.

36
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:21,000
I have to get used to it.

37
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:24,671
All right, let's do it. Start rolling.

38
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:26,839
From the beginning.

39
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:58,538
-Okay. cut.
-Cut.

40
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:04,677
A towel. Give me a towel.

41
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:07,380
I slipped.

42
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:10,850
I couldn't go back after this.

43
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:31,804
I'm sorry.

44
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:33,640
Are you okay?

45
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:35,341
I'm okay.

46
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:45,118
-Cut!
-Okay, cut.

47
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,187
It was just me, sorry.

48
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,692
<i>The filming lasted three hours.</i>

49
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:57,030
<i>The six decided on the staging
and dared to challenge themselves.</i>

50
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:01,234
-Bring the steps, please.
-My teeth were chattering.

51
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,912
Oh, it's cold!

52
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:18,785
It's like a hangout for old men.

53
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:22,689
Oh, it's really tough, isn't it?

54
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:25,925
-Looks like a group of stuntmen.
-A group of stuntmen?

55
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:31,230
<i>Even on this day, Okada continued to
take pictures of the members.</i>

56
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:33,399
Start rolling.

57
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:38,137
-Play the song.
-Three, two, one!

58
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,742
Okay, perfect!

59
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:45,011
Oh, this is great!

60
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:47,880
Amazing.

61
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:51,718
Wow, this is so cool. Who is this?

62
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:53,186
This is Ken.

63
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:56,522
-Looks like a religious painting.
-It does.

64
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:58,191
I shot a religious painting.

65
00:05:58,691 --> 00:05:59,826
Let's do it.

66
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:02,929
<i>Miyake shoots Okada.</i>

67
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:05,231
Let's start.

68
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:07,233
Three, two, one!

69
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,773
-I like it.
-Here comes the water burst.

70
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,441
One, two, three, four,

71
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:18,277
five, six, seven, eight, one!

72
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,618
Here's the preview.

73
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,894
That's a wrap.

74
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:37,029
Thank you. Thank you very much.

75
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:40,933
Thank you very much.

76
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,503
Good work!

77
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:48,474
{\an8}So I don't want them to feel too much.

78
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,543
{\an8}-I see.
-That's what I feel.

79
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,979
{\an8}-After we did it?
-Yeah.

80
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:55,782
I think it's about time to decide.

81
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:57,250
-Decide now?
-Right.

82
00:06:57,316 --> 00:07:01,053
If we can sing "WALK" and "Hane"
wholeheartedly, that's good.

83
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:08,127
If we can really sing them properly,
those songs before them will be...

84
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:11,931
Or should we try not to make
that section over the top.

85
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:17,303
Well, the full version
of that is pretty long.

86
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:21,741
I don't want us to look like
we're trying too hard with it.

87
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:24,444
I'm starting to think
"SPARK" is just right.

88
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:28,114
I think "SPARK" would be about right.

89
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:33,019
Which do you want to prioritize,
the songs or the audience's excitement?

90
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:34,854
Which one?

91
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:41,461
If we can sing "WALK"
and "Hane" wholeheartedly...

92
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:43,596
All right. I tell you what.

93
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:46,666
-Let's postpone the decision.
-Okay, got it.

94
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:49,368
He postponed it.

95
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:52,104
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you very much.

96
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,942
Good work.

97
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,812
{\an8}2020 OCTOBER 30
2 DAYS BEFORE THE LIVESTREAM SHOW

98
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:06,419
<i>The stage that they put their
special thoughts into had been set up.</i>

99
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:17,129
It's amazing. Apparently, there are as
many crew here as a dome stadium concert.

100
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:21,701
Usually, we'd have an audience down there.

101
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:24,937
So I'd like to turn it into
something positive.

102
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:30,476
There's a lot of "We can't do it" and
"We have no choice" in this world.

103
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:35,481
But I'd rather not show it to my audience...

104
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,852
when we make things.

105
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:43,022
{\an8}THE DAY BEFORE THE SHOW

106
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:46,893
{\an8}<i>Even on this day, they filmed
videos for the show.</i>

107
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:53,266
<i>You'll be in the rain and
we'll film it with a high-speed camera.</i>

108
00:08:56,035 --> 00:09:00,106
<i>The last song for
the general audience is "Hane."</i>

109
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:04,210
<i>This staging is
related to a special memory.</i>

110
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:12,885
{\an8}<i>In a concert in 2003,</i>

111
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:16,756
{\an8}<i>at the same Yoyogi Gymnasium,
they let it rain.</i>

112
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:18,958
{\an8}"HANE"

113
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,909
<i>Playing the video in reverse.</i>

114
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:49,855
<i>Along with the rain,
time flowed in reverse.</i>

115
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:57,797
-The floor...
-Staff members, please step back a moment.

116
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,232
Is everyone in?

117
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:02,368
Okay, the stage...

118
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:06,372
Ready? I'm gonna take it. One, two.

119
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:10,276
{\an8}2020 NOVEMBER 1
THREE HOURS LEFT

120
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:12,011
{\an8}<i>The day had come.</i>

121
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:18,417
<i>Revisions continued
until the very last minute.</i>

122
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:24,090
I feel like it's hard to see
the bond between members.

123
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:24,991
I see.

124
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:27,927
-There aren't many scenes like that.
-Yeah.

125
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,997
It depends on the vibe in between songs.

126
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:33,933
Everything else is perfectly staged,

127
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,069
but that's an emotional aspect.

128
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:40,706
Just taking a glance at the others
when you move would be fine.

129
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:44,410
{\an8}AN HOUR BEFORE THE SHOW

130
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,444
Any thoughts, Go?

131
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:49,649
I think just the beginning is fine
if we're gonna do it.

132
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:51,917
There's still an hour,
they can prepare it.

133
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,253
They've got lots of other things to do.

134
00:10:55,521 --> 00:11:00,793
{\an8}30 MINUTES BEFORE THE SHOW

135
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:09,635
{\an8}15 MINUTES BEFORE THE SHOW

136
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:17,176
Two minutes to go
until the livestream starts.

137
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:28,888
Okay, less than 30 seconds to go.

138
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:41,000
<i>At that moment, the six held
each other's hands without being noticed.</i>

139
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:50,276
<i>The special time had begun.</i>

140
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:14,667
"THUNDERBIRD"

141
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:55,861
We'll sing two songs that represent
who we are now before we say goodbye.

142
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,014
THE FANS SENT THEM A MESSAGE

143
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:30,783
CONGRATS ON YOUR 25TH ANNIVERSARY!

144
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:33,085
{\an8}TO YOU, WHO HAVE STRIVED FOR 25 YEARS

145
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:35,087
{\an8}WE'RE MISSING YOU ESPECIALLY TODAY

146
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:37,956
{\an8}YOU'VE NEVER STOPPED FOR 25 YEARS

147
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:39,224
{\an8}WE WANTED TO SEE YOU

148
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:42,861
None of the members changed
and we didn't lose any either

149
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:45,130
and we've been running for 25 years.

150
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:48,233
The fact that we've always kept
this group alive

151
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:55,974
really means a lot in our lives, I think.

152
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:02,147
Being idols for 25 years means that

153
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:08,754
we had to continue to be loved
by many people for 25 years.

154
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:15,327
And I thought no one
could understand how that felt.

155
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:22,067
But now, I really feel like
people understand that.

156
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:26,805
I've always hoped that
by singing, dancing,

157
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:29,908
and providing entertainment,

158
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:36,115
even if it is just a little,
we would be able to help you

159
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:41,553
and cheer you up,
so we've continued to do that.

160
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:45,424
But I fully realized
that because our fans supported us,

161
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:49,995
we were able to keep providing something.

162
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:54,733
I once again felt that we are connected.

163
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:57,469
I'm really grateful.

164
00:18:57,536 --> 00:19:02,207
I realize that we've been able to
do this for 25 years because of our fans

165
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:05,144
every time we do a concert like this.

166
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:09,548
We've been doing this for 25 years
and of course, it wasn't all roses.

167
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:13,352
But we've been doing this
for a long time and today...

168
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:20,626
we get to celebrate this anniversary.

169
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:28,066
I really feel that our fans are giving us...

170
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,137
courage and energy.

171
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:35,307
