00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:06,206
SUMMER 2020

2
00:00:06,272 --> 00:00:08,641
<i>This year was a turning point.</i>

3
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:13,947
<i>What kind of summer did they have?</i>

4
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:18,118
It felt like my first summer.

5
00:00:18,651 --> 00:00:21,154
I was able to reaffirm...

6
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:22,322
RYUSEI ONISHI

7
00:00:23,556 --> 00:00:26,860
...how glad I am to be an idol.

8
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:32,832
<i>It all began here.</i>

9
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,808
<i>The idol unit</i>

10
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,243
<i>Naniwa Danshi.</i>

11
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:49,582
{\an8}<i>They lost their chance
to perform due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</i>

12
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:50,784
{\an8}<i>On this night,</i>

13
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:56,156
{\an8}<i>they were able to reaffirm that
the stage is where they feel alive.</i>

14
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:04,931
{\an8}That was fun. I felt like
I got to be an idol again.

15
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,756
<i>This is documentary series</i> RIDE ON TIME.

16
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:36,696
<i>As Naniwa Danshi
started to garner attention...</i>

17
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:44,637
<i>they were undergoing a new challenge
at Shochikuza, their second home.</i>

18
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,605
CLOSED

19
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:57,050
<i>Shochikuza had canceled many shows,</i>

20
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:02,155
{\an8}<i>so they were putting on a livestream show

21
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:03,857
{\an8}EMPTY-VENUE LIVESTREAM SHOW

Takahashi.

24
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:11,731
There's a camera.

25
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,067
{\an8}-Good morning.
-What is the camera for?

26
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:15,835
<i>RIDE ON TIME</i>.

27
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:16,736
Correct!

28
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,105
{\an8}-It's for our future selves.
-To remember.

29
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:20,106
Right.

30
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:22,108
I hope to be at the top.

31
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:26,579
<i>Though the effects of isolation linger,</i>

32
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:30,283
<i>they seem cheerful after
their first good workout in a while.</i>

33
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:33,987
This is intense.

34
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:37,090
{\an8}<i>There'll be no audience,</i>

35
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:41,895
{\an8}<i>but they want to use this stage
to present a new side of themselves.</i>

36
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:43,796
I'm scared.

37
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:48,168
{\an8}I want to show how much
we've improved since last time.

38
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:51,905
With the quarantine,
we have a lot we want to let out.

39
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:56,476
That's what I'd like
you to capture on camera.

40
00:02:57,877 --> 00:02:58,945
Hey.

41
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:01,614
Could you two not make all that noise?

42
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:03,049
They can edit it.

43
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:13,760
<i>Yes, their lives have changed
drastically these last two years.</i>

44
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:17,030
<i>They had a rich experience
beyond their imaginations.</i>

45
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:24,504
{\an8}<i>Naniwa Danshi was formed</i>

46
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:27,207
{\an8}<i>in October 2018.</i>

47
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:32,345
{\an8}<i>Since then, they have continued
to light up the scene.</i>

{\an8}<i>Two months after their formation,</i>

50
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:46,326
{\an8}<i>they played four shows to a sold-out crowd

<i>One year later...</i>

53
00:03:56,936 --> 00:03:59,572
{\an8}<i>they advanced to Kyocera Dome Osaka.</i>

54
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:03,776
<i>They attracted
130,000 people over three shows.</i>

55
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:13,720
<i>However, the looming COVID-19 pandemic
would cast a shadow on their momentum.</i>

56
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,158
<i>To draw interest from fans overseas,</i>

57
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:22,662
<i>they planned a show
that would embrace Japanese culture.</i>

58
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:25,932
<i>It was to be held at the sumo arena,
but was cancelled.</i>

59
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:28,534
MARCH 29, 30
RYOGOKU KOKUGIKAN SHOWS CANCELED

60
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:32,472
<i>Since then,</i>

61
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:36,409
<i>they haven't had
another chance to stand on stage.</i>

62
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:42,548
The other gigs we had scheduled

63
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,484
were postponed.

64
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,818
That includes TV work.

65
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:47,153
They'd be postponed.

66
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,188
We couldn't anticipate anything.

67
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:50,957
We can't even do that now.

68
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:56,396
It was worse, though. Each day was
like fumbling through the darkness,

69
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,965
trying to make our way forward.

70
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:02,902
We had nowhere to direct it.

71
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:05,838
This feeling, these emotions.

72
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:08,841
It was frustrating.

73
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,515
It's frustrating when you
think it was COVID's fault.

74
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:20,653
<i>And there was one more obstacle</i>

75
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,323
<i>that they had to overcome.</i>

<i>July.</i>

{\an8}SHUNSUKE MICHIEDA (18)

88
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:14,340
{\an8}<i>Michieda was busy with constant
offers for TV acting roles,</i>

89

{\an8}<i>and he joins them after wrapping.</i>

90
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,889
<i>Two years ago, he was constantly scolded</i>

91
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:32,859
<i>by the older members
for taking things too easy,</i>

92
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:35,361
<i>but that is not the case anymore.</i>

93
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:45,171
-Michi has something to say!
-"7stars."

94
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,939
-Okay.
-Let's rehearse that.

95
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:48,207
Okay.

96
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,180
What's this?

97
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,716
We attached a hoodie to a shirt.

98

{\an8}KENTO NAGAO (18)

100
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:05,525
I don't like it baggy.

101
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,660
A belt would be nice.

102
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:10,563
Like a belt that's attached on the inside.

103
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,632
Do you think you could make this?

104
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:13,733
Okay, understood.

105
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,301

Have a good night.

113

Have a good night.

114
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,395
Did you learn something
by being in charge?

115
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,396
Yes, of course.

116
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,165
You can be more objective.

117
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:49,068
I've always been one of the players,

118
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:52,638
but now I can step back and
see the audience's perspective.

119
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:54,140
And look.

120
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:57,877
"VS Skit produced by Joichiro Fujiwara."

121
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:59,412
They tease me about it.

122
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,548
I guess they do it out of love though.

123
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:04,684
<i>Only two years after forming,</i>

124
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:08,254
<i>each member has been expanding
their own field of expertise.</i>

125
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:16,429
<i>That is why the time they spent
this summer was so valuable.</i>

126
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,233
Ready and action!

127
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:25,738
<i>The seven members were filming
a teen drama series together</i>

128
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,907
<i>about a group of high school boys</i>

129
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:32,645
<i>with unique personalities
who attend a boarding school.</i>

130
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:39,652
<i>We ask Nagao what his role is.</i>

131
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:42,121
I'm really feminine.

132
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:44,991
Someone who likes cute things.

133
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:48,060
I've never worn something so frilly.

134
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:51,297
I'm doing my best.

135
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:53,299
When did you wake up?

136
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,269
Today? Some of the guys woke up at 3:30.

137
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:58,371
Right?

138
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:02,174
<i>They spent every day being together
from the early morning</i>

139
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:03,943
<i>for nearly a month and a half.</i>

140
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:14,954
Ready?

141
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:18,090
Ready?

142
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:22,161
<i>As each finds individual success,</i>

143
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:26,966
<i>they will gradually lose the time
they can spend together as a group.</i>

144
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:32,939
It's special that the seven
of us are starring in this.

145
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:35,541
We don't know what the future holds.

146
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:39,579
Is there a big difference between
shooting a show solo and as a group?

147
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:41,280
It's completely different.

148
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,883
It's reassuring.

149
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:47,753
When someone isn't quite
up to par that day,

150
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,488
we can support each other.

151
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:53,292
That's a really big deal.

152
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:07,840
{\an8}FOUR DAYS UNTIL THE SHOW

153
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:11,844
{\an8}<i>The day of their big livestream
in Shochikuza was drawing near.</i>

154
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:17,049
Hey.

155
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,417
The doll part.

156
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:25,257
<i>Unlike the times before,
they had to come up with their own ideas</i>

157
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:28,294
<i>for the presentation of each song.</i>

158
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:33,499
...and you follow it up.
I'll think of something later.

159
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:37,036
What if everyone comes out
from behind when we shout?

160
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,339
I want something with lots of energy.

161
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:46,379
<i>They were thinking of ways
to showcase their own unique style.</i>

162
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,851
It's not about who's better,

163
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:54,854
we need to show how we're different.

164
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,255
KAZUYA OHASHI

165
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,992
But that's pretty difficult.

166
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:02,728
-Let's set up for "Firebird."
-Okay.

167
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,309
You're not quite getting that part.

168
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:21,747
No.

169
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:23,916
-Let me explain it again.
-Okay.

170
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:25,685
Do you see the line?

171
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:28,454
So like this then this?

172
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,924
<i>They began rehearsing
one of the big numbers for the show.</i>

173
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:39,231
<i>The show's theme is "Zero Distance."</i>

174
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:43,469
<i>It's meant to give fans</i>

175
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,839
<i>a close and intimate watching experience.</i>

176
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:54,180
Something like this?

177
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:55,881
That's too far.

178
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:57,416
-Then this much?
-Yes.

179
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:58,918
I think the cord...

180
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:04,590
<i>This is the number that they
were going to perform in Ryogoku.</i>

181
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:11,931
Ryusei, can you line up next to Nagao
so you're shoulder to shoulder?

182
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:14,967
Can you give it another try
from there together?

183
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,636
Ohashi's part is the same.

184
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:20,206
<i>What will the final result look like?</i>

185
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,177
<i>Also on the same day...</i>

186
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:30,316
Charades!

187
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:34,286
<i>Lil Kansai was rehearsing</i>

188
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:37,323
<i>their variety segment
with the Jr. trainees.</i>

189
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:39,592
-Charades!
-You all know the rules.

190
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:41,327
After School Lil!

191
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:43,662
{\an8}<i>Fujiwara was in charge of direction.</i>

192
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:47,032
{\an8}NANIWA DANSHI
JOICHIRO FUJIWARA

193
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,934
The ceiling camera is awesome.

194
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:55,574
<i>They draw out the kids'
natural energy and cuteness.</i>

195
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:58,677
Here we go. Ready?

196
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:00,546
One!

197
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:06,418
Hey now, this teacher
has no patience for your pain.

198
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:08,454
Hurry, let's go!

199
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:11,924
<i>But something seems to be on his mind.</i>

200
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:14,527
Fuga!

201
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:19,265
<i>He heads to the member
in charge of the MC role.</i>

202
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,300
-Hey, Fuga.
-What's up?

203
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:23,602
Don't "What's up?" me.

204
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:24,503
What's up?

205
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,505
{\an8}When you introduce the next song,

206
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:30,109
{\an8}you use the same tone as
when you call out a song title.

207
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:32,244
Like, "Check out this next song."

208
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:35,815
Instead say, "Let's go to our next song!"
Then cue the song.

209
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:38,150
-And you're turning too much.
-Okay.

210
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:42,254
If you're in front and we're behind,
you end up facing the wrong way.

211
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,789
Instead, step backwards.

212
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:46,158
-Back to your spot.
-Okay.

213
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:47,526
Then start talking...

214
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:50,362
<i>He gives specific direction.</i>

215
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,665
Okay, jump. Ready?

216
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:55,334
-Ow!
-Ow!

217
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:56,235
Exactly.

218
00:13:56,302 --> 00:14:00,206
<i>And he makes the stage
a fun place for the kids.</i>

219
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:05,711
You're trying to convey
the pain to the camera.

220
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:07,112
Okay.

221
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:10,382
From KanJani8 to Johnnys' WEST,
from WEST to Kansai Jr.

222
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:12,685
You have to show the Jr. trainees

223
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:18,357
that there's this system,
even though they're young.

224
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:22,695
But seeing them in the green room,
I'm glad they're still the same.

225
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,800
{\an8}AUGUST 18
DAY OF THE LIVESTREAM SHOW

226
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:31,003
{\an8}<i>The big day finally arrives.</i>

227
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,108
<i>They rehearse right until showtime.</i>

228
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:45,150
<i>What can idols deliver
during the COVID-19 pandemic?</i>

229
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:49,121
We'll go with these members.

230
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:54,126
Okay.

231
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:58,731
<i>Then, 30 minutes before curtain...</i>

232
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:01,901
Now? Costume designer!

233
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:02,835
It's a crisis!

234
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:04,904
Michieda's pants are torn.

235
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,672
-Michi has a tear.
-I do.

236
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,641
I actually tore them.

237
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:10,843
-Okay.
-I tore them.

238
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,911
He needs them now.

239
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:13,679
Sorry, I forgot to mention it.

240
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:16,282
You have to tell us sooner, Michi!

241
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:17,182
Want to change?

242
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,217
I'm sorry.

243
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:19,818
We still have 30.

244
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:21,954
We can make it. Go!

245
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:25,124
This will be a summer memory.

246
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:29,028
I'm going to give it my all.

247
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:34,733
{\an8}NANIWA DANSHI
EMPTY-VENUE LIVESTREAM CONCERT

248
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,503
{\an8}<i>Naniwa Danshi's livestream began.</i>

249
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:46,946
"DIAMOND SMILE"

250
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:52,751
"AOHARU -WITH U WITH ME-"

251
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:53,912
(NEW SONG)

252
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:25,677
Good work today!

253
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:27,513
I think it went well.

254
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:29,148
I'm smiling like this guy.

255
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,219
I need to get better.

256
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,158
I'll keep working hard
to entertain everyone.

257
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:40,692
Yes!

258
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:42,828
Everything we had bottled inside,

259
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:46,465
we were able to release
today with this show.

260
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:49,068
Right now, I'm feeling really rejuvenated.

261
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,104
I'd like us to become big enough stars

262
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:55,107
to do a dome tour.

263
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:57,609
Hopefully within five years.

264
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:02,981
<i>At the end of August,</i>

265
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:05,484
<i>the members of Kansai Johnny's Jr.</i>

266
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:08,120
<i>were taking on a new challenge again.</i>

267
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,690
I'm freaking out.

268
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,425
LIL KANSAI

269
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,895
<i>Many shows were canceled
because of the pandemic.</i>

270
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:21,667
{\an8}<i>This would be Lil Kansai's
first show with an audience,</i>

271
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:24,603
{\an8}<i>as well as their first solo show.</i>

272
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,673
{\an8}CONGRATS ON YOUR FIRST SOLO SHOW!

273
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:30,876
Oh man, I'm about to cry here.

274
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,200
{\an8}Thank you.

275
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:57,669
{\an8}<i>Four days later, Ae! group...</i>

276
00:18:57,736 --> 00:18:58,937
{\an8}There's an audience.

277
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:00,873
I can't believe it.

278
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:04,076
I'm so moved.

279
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:35,307
<i>It was a special summer where
each member spent time thinking</i>

280
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:37,075
<i>about what being an idol means.</i>

281
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:39,745
What would you say your job is?

282
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:41,246
My job?

283
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:43,215
-If I'm trying to be cool...
-What?

284
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:44,816
My job is to sell dreams.

285
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:49,488
Do you think being an idol
is a necessary job?

286
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:52,324
If you're asking if everyone needs it,

287
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:54,259
then the answer is no.

288
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,396
But if there are people who need us,

289
00:19:57,896 --> 00:20:03,468
then I feel like we need to
work hard for their sake.

290
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:07,506
We're on this journey now
to discover that.

291
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,243
Yes, this will be a long journey.

292
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:18,317
<i>They have a song dedicated
to that journey.</i>

293
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:23,822
{\an8}<i>They sang it here, where
the World Expo will be held in five years.</i>

294
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:39,571
In five years?

295
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:44,209
I hope we'll have all made our debut.

296
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:47,546
<i>If we can bring in 2025 as one team,</i>

297
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:49,615
<i>that would make me happy.</i>

298
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:53,885
I hope to be at the top of Kansai Jr.

299
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:56,188
I bet I'll have blue hair by then.

300
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,756
I have no idea about mine.

301
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:06,598
{\an8}I hope the five of us are still together.

302
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:07,833
{\an8}Surprise!

303
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:10,302
{\an8}You ruined our joke!

304
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:13,205
{\an8}I want to look back
at how we wanted to be famous

305
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:16,208
{\an8}and say we've surpassed it.

306
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:19,211
{\an8}I hope we're even bigger by then.

307
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,880
{\an8}There will always be a challenge.

308
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:28,120
{\an8}<i>Their journey will continue.</i>

309
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:34,092
{\an8}<i>On the next</i> RIDE ON TIME<i>,</i>

310
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,827
{\an8}<i>it's Sexy Zone.</i>

311
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:40,198
<i>What are their true thoughts
entering their ninth year?</i>

312
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:44,269
I've always had anxiety with this group.

313
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:46,438
I felt like we fell short...

314
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:48,340
I was really frustrated.

315
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:52,311
<i>We take a closer look
at the youngest group to debut.</i>

316
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:59,017
The four of us and Matsushima
agreed to give each other some space.

317
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:01,353
He's really like the sun.

318
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:06,024
{\an8}<i>For the fans who waited for them.</i>

319
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:07,259
{\an8}It's So!

320
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,160
{\an8}I'm back.

321
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:12,831
Let's go!

322
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:14,733
Yeah!

323
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,867
