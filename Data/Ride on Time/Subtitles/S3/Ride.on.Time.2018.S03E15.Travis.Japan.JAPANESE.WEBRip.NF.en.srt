Hey, me too.

00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:15,382
-What card games do you play?
-Yu-Gi-Oh! and Pokemon.

00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:19,219
-Yes, I do.

Sorry.

-Good to see you.

00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:44,611
I think it's been about
a month since I cut it.

19
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:50,450
At New Year's, our group danced
behind ARASHI at their final concert.

20
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:51,851
I watched it.

21
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:56,689
When we found out I couldn't go on,

22
00:00:56,756 --> 00:01:01,094
everyone else had
to re-rehearse everything,

23
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:04,697
so I feel really bad about that.

24
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:08,201
You know...

25
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:10,236
After that happened,

26
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:15,175
I dwelled on it for about a week.

27
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,277
What do you most want to do now?

28
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:18,711
-Right now?
-Yes.

29
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:22,649

If you go one, two, three.

53

It changes the way it looks if you just
focus the movement within yourself.

54
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:51,664
You guys will synchronize
even if you don't want to.

55
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:56,669
So rather than focus on that, try to be
more conscious of the groove and rhythm.

68
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:36,736
I want them to be...

69
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:40,673

70
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,309

71

It's crazy difficult.

81
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,473
This might be
my favorite song in the world.

82
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,142
-This version?
-Yeah.

83
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,143

84
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:51,244

85
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,645

93
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:21,007
it'll slow you down.

94
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:24,544

I'm exhausted.

99
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:21,334
Everyone's good at learning,

100
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,836
but learning and doing aren't the same.

101
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:26,539
Like, "Wow, it's this different."

102
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:28,941
It feels like the real deal.

103
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:32,545
I don't feel like I'm doing well at all.

104
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,285
It's the first day.

105
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,253
It's fine.

106
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:42,288
I was kinda sleepy myself.

107
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:46,192
If anything...

108
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:50,329
I'd rather them not try too hard.

109
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:54,133
Yeah.

110
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,037
I've been telling them not to try so hard.

111
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:01,807
They don't have to give it their all.

112
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:07,747
<i>This was the homework Yara gave them
during the previous session.</i>

113
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:24,931
I thought you were really flat
throughout the whole thing.

114
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:28,401
"They're working really hard."

115
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,872
"They're going for it with the dancing."

116
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:34,307
It didn't get past that.

117
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:39,111
To be honest, it hurts.

118
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:47,153
He's right.

119
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:53,793
If it looks like they're trying hard,
then that's where it'll end.

120
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:59,265
As a viewer, you want to be able to see
another story or something.

121
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:03,569
Still, I think they've
really improved since last year.

122
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:05,004
-Really?
-Yeah.

123
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:07,607
{\an8}With everything
they've done over the year,

124
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,177
{\an8}I think they've gotten past that.

125
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:18,050
{\an8}<i>Until now, they've dedicated their time
to improving their precision,</i>

126
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,953
{\an8}<i>in order to perfect dancing in unison.</i>

127
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:29,495
<i>However,</i>

128
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:34,700
<i>that also meant stifling the expression
of each individual performer.</i>

129
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:40,673
<i>People say my expression is scary.</i>

130
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,777
I just get into the song.

131
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:51,617
I'm just giving over my entire soul.

132
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:55,421
But I guess it comes off as scary.

133
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,455
I see.

134
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,659
So in an effort to seem less scary...

135
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:04,930
I hold a part of me back.

136
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:10,770
Sometimes I think that
the way I did it last year felt better.

137
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,406
I don't know which is right,

138
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:17,476
but then sometimes I think
it looks better this year.

139
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:19,345
I'm still figuring it out.

140
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:20,846
I see.

141
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:27,219
I guess dancing in unison is something
we need to try harder to do,

142
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:32,425
but to us, that goes without saying.

143
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:37,096
{\an8}For example, we often do this song
"It's BAD,"

144
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:40,800
{\an8}and the choreography doesn't
really call for idiosyncrasy.

145
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:47,039
So when we started talking about what we
want to do for our next coordinated dance,

146
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:50,643
Yara told us
the same thing last year, but...

147
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:56,949
"If you synchronize the feel of a dance,

148
00:11:57,616 --> 00:12:01,921
it will look unified even if you have
slightly different interpretations."

149
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:03,589
That's what he told us.

150
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:06,559
So in regard to synchronizing our vision...

151
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:11,063
A song like the one we made this year,
"Happy Groovy,"

152
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:17,336
<i>with that jazz arrangement,
makes it seem we're synchronized</i>

153
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:20,239
<i>even when the choreography
looks a bit different.</i>

154
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:23,375
That's another strategy we're trying.

155
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,700
-It might work if we hit that part.
-Yes.

156
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,201
Shime's too far.

157
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:51,604
Maybe we let him through first.

158
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,905
Shime.

159
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:57,409
He goes, then it's Kaito, Shime, Kaito.

160
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:58,644
-Okay.
-Yeah.

161
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:00,913
Yeah, there.

162
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:05,718
Kaito goes through
the middle at the start.

163
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:07,953
You mean like this?

164
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:10,556
Like this and stop.

165
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:12,792
Then you can go this way.

166
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:14,326
So we don't hit each other.

167
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:15,294
Okay.

168
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:17,830
-So you're first.
-Okay.

169
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:19,365
Ready?

170
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:22,134
Good, like that.

171
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:24,670
Then I come in.

172
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:45,424
Awesome!

173
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:52,398
That was really cool.
You just barely slid by each other.

174
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:54,834
-That'll be our base.
-Okay.

175
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,136
-Thank you all.
-Thank you!

176
00:13:57,203 --> 00:14:00,072
<i>The choreographing finished in five hours.</i>

177
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:05,477
<i>However, the wonderful dance
gave the members mixed feelings.</i>

178
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:08,914
{\an8}I feel like if we try harder,

179
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:14,119
{\an8}we can seriously make something
that gives you goosebumps.

180
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,754
{\an8}Especially with this song.

181
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,527
But we don't have the time.

182
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:33,405
<i>The play's first act features a variety of
performances like action and tap numbers,</i>

183
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:36,842
<i>while the second act
focuses on dance numbers.</i>

184
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:48,554
<i>There was a lot to learn
in a limited amount of time.</i>

185
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:54,593
<i>Moreover, most of the program's difficulty
had been raised from the last show.</i>

186
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,546
{\an8}Are you okay?

187
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:16,715
{\an8}You're not pushing too hard?

188
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:18,517
{\an8}I don't know.

189
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:22,154
{\an8}-So it's not something you're measuring?
-Right.

190
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:27,092
About once every two or three days,

191
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:32,398
I wonder whether I'm improving at all.

192
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:34,900
-Really?
-Yes.

193
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:36,969
-Why?
-Well...

194
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,639
I'm turning 25.

195
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:48,514
I often get told that I'm pretty childish.

196
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:52,017
I wonder if it's okay to be such a kid.

197
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:58,324
This is more like a personal issue
than a work issue.

198
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:01,860
You're unsure if you're mature enough?

199
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:03,095
Yeah.

200
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:07,499
Like, am I even aware of my surroundings?

201
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:14,907
Sometimes that pops into my head
while I'm working.

202
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:28,087
<i>Not trying too hard is proving
to be harder than they imagined.</i>

203
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,323
MEETING ROOM (2)

204
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:36,462
{\an8}This is my usual green room.

205
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:38,464
{\an8}RYUYA SHIMEKAKE

206
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,199
-Every week?
-Yes.

207
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:41,467
Thank you.

208
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,004
-Your usual tuna mayo <i>onigiri</i>.
-Okay.

209
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:51,010
<i>Once a week, Shimekake appears on a local
program in Tochigi, his home prefecture.</i>

210
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:53,946
Four, three.

211
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:57,016
TOCHIGI TELEVISION
EVENING 6 PLUS

212
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:58,951
Message Theme Talk!

213
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,653
"Dochide SHOW"!

214
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:07,393
<i>He enjoys this part of his job,</i>

215
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:12,297
<i>sharing news about himself
and the group with his hometown.</i>

216
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,333
Really?

217
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,101
Let's take a closer look.

218
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:20,172
<i>Within the homey ambiance,</i>

219
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:24,043
<i>he learned about work
he's never experienced before.</i>

220
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:29,948
<i>I'm writing a letter on my computer.</i>

221
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:31,650
-It has a "t".
-Right.

222
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,420
-Do you remember this, Shime?
-Yes, I do.

223
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:36,488
-It was a bit muddy.
-Yes.

224
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:37,790
This one wasn't muddy.

225
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:39,158
It's British English.

226
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:42,327
American English gets a bit muddy.

227
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,763
It sounds more like a "d."

228
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,065
That's all.

229
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:50,269
<i>Shimekake left his hometown
when he was around 18.</i>

230
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:53,305
<i>He came to Tokyo filled with hope.</i>

231
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:57,309
I just kind of left without thinking.

232
00:17:57,376 --> 00:18:00,979
I just wanted to get
far away from the nest.

233
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:05,818
Then I suddenly lost work
at the same time.

234
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,455
I was like,
"It wasn't supposed to be like this."

235
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:13,325
So because I kept losing work,

236
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:15,627
I was losing money.

237
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:18,297
I started worrying about rent.

238
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:24,470
I was trying to make do,
barely scraping by.

239
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:30,576
I mean, I got through it and now
I'm making a living just fine,

240
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,245
but it was tough at the time.

241
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:43,622
Success isn't guaranteed.

242
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:48,360
Okay, let's end on a message from Shime!

243
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:49,461
Please go ahead.

244
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:51,797
Next month, Travis Japan has a play,

245
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:53,799
and we would love your support.

246
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,501
I'll do my best.

247
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:56,869
Good luck!

248
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:02,141
Thank you very much! Good work.

249
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:04,309
-Good work.
-Thank you.

250
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:06,512
-We finished on time.
-Yes.

251
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:07,713
We fit it all in.

252
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:12,017
I actually wanted to say,
"I'll be waiting for your <i>gyoza</i>, Daiji."

253
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:13,018
That's too bad.

254
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:15,220
Sorry, if I was two seconds faster...

255
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:18,991
I saw I only had three seconds left
when I started to say it.

256
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:22,561
You figured it wouldn't fit.
You've been mindful of time lately.

257
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:25,130
I should've given you a countdown.

258
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:27,332
I should've spoken two seconds faster.

259
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:29,968
Okay, let's say that next week.

260
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:38,944
<i>This has been the only job
I felt was worth doing.</i>

261
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:42,047
You had other options, didn't you?

262
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:44,283
No, not really.

263
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,485
I mean, not at all.

264
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:48,187
Really?

265
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:49,154
Yeah.

266
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:54,760
There are some difficult times,
but most of it is good.

267
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,097
Yeah.

268
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:05,971
<i>There's something I'm picky about.</i>

269
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:09,308
<i>Even if it's a minute detail.</i>

270
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,843
{\an8}That's just how much Travis...

271
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:12,945
{\an8}KAITO MATSUKURA

272
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:16,582
{\an8}...cares about our synchronized dance.

273
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:20,118
{\an8}So in that regard...

274
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:27,693
we should be showcasing our
personality as Travis Japan.

275
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:32,197
Not each of our individual personalities.

276
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:38,170
Sometimes my own personality
gets in the way of that.

277
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:44,309
However, I feel like...

278
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:50,849
I should hold onto my convictions,
because if that falters,

279
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:54,620
well, I won't be myself anymore.

280
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:59,258
I strongly believe that,
so I want to hold onto them forever.

281
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:06,999
<i>They don't want to
give up their expression.</i>

282
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:33,191
<i>They use their hard training, joy,
and even their personal struggles</i>

283
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:36,395
<i>to expand their sense of expression.</i>

284
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:49,808
<i>Then they will demonstrate to the world...</i>

285
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:54,279
<i>the power of entertainment.</i>

286
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:59,518
TORAJYA NINJAPAN 2020

287
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:02,921
{\an8}<i>Next time,</i>

288
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:07,659
{\an8}<i>what is their determination as they stand
before the audience on the main stage?</i>

289
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:11,897
{\an8}I like receiving the praise
and applause from the fans.

290
00:22:11,963 --> 00:22:15,434
{\an8}I'd say that it drives me
to aim higher even now.
