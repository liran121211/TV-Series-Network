1
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:04,504
There's an echo.

2
00:00:05,872 --> 00:00:07,707
-Wow.
-Right?

3
00:00:10,443 --> 00:00:13,179
{\an8}<i>These men are visiting
Osaka's Kyocera Dome</i>

4
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:15,648
{\an8}<i>after losing something important to them.</i>

5
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:17,751
Can you indulge me?

6
00:00:17,817 --> 00:00:18,651
I'm home!

7
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:24,090
I want to say that in front
of an audience.

8
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:26,626
Seeing it again, it's so huge.

9
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,962
-It is huge.
-Was it always this big?

10
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:32,465
{\an8}<i>This is idol group</i>

11
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,000
{\an8}<i>Johnnys' WEST.</i>

12
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:36,603
{\an8}<i>Their summer performances</i>

13
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:40,507
{\an8}<i>scheduled for the dome stadiums
in Tokyo and Osaka were canceled...</i>

14
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,047
<i>due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</i>

15
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:53,319
{\an8}I've been doing this for ten years,
and it's the first time I cried over work.

16
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,122
<i>I was pretty bummed out.</i>

17
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:57,857
<i>I'm 27 right now,</i>

18
00:00:57,924 --> 00:01:01,995
{\an8}so canceling those concerts made me
miss out on a one-time experience.

19
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:04,931
When I sit and think about everything,

20
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:07,100
it's a little painful.

21
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:12,439
<i>In order to vent such frustrations,</i>

22
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:16,242
<i>they took to the stage this summer.</i>

23
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:43,436

{\an8}JULY 28 - EXPO'70 COMMEMORATIVE PARK

25
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:50,410
{\an8}<i>In July,</i>

26
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:54,714
{\an8}<i>Johnnys' WEST shared the stage
with over 70 of their juniors and seniors</i>

27
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,684
{\an8}<i>who all hail from Kansai.</i>

28
00:01:58,184 --> 00:02:02,255
<i>It was a way to send a message of joy
to all of Japan from Kansai.</i>

29
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:14,767
<i>Johnnys' WEST's greatest weapon
is their enthusiasm.</i>

30
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:17,070
{\an8}<i>This man is the embodiment of that.</i>

31
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:21,241
{\an8}<i>Akito Kiriyama who is
also an actor and MC.</i>

32

{\an8}AKITO KIRIYAMA (31)

33
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:28,181

{\an8}TOMOHIRO KAMIYAMA (27)

35
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:32,986
{\an8}<i>Nozomu Kotaki is stylish like a model,</i>

36
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:37,056
{\an8}<i>and has a strong sense of responsibility
despite being the youngest.</i>

37
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:38,658
{\an8}NOZOMU KOTAKI (24)

38
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:45,265
{\an8}<i>Takahiro Hamada is
the funny mood maker of the group.</i>

39
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,300
{\an8}TAKAHIRO HAMADA (31)

40
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:52,805
{\an8}<i>Working with KanJani8
to direct the production of this concert,</i>

41
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:57,544
{\an8}<i>was the oldest and dependable
Junta Nakama and...</i>

42
00:02:58,311 --> 00:02:59,145
How was it?

43
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:00,513
It's not bad.

44
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,149
{\an8}They've allowed us to make it together.

45
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:04,684
{\an8}It feels like a festival.

46
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:08,388
{\an8}<i>...Ryusei Fujii, who is in charge
of the show's staging.</i>

47
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:10,623
{\an8}RYUSEI FUJII (27)

48
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:14,761
{\an8}<i>Finally, the group's center,</i>

49
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:16,396
{\an8}<i>Daiki Shigeoka.</i>

50
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:19,899
{\an8}<i>He's recently garnered acclaim
for his acting skills.</i>

51
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:21,401
{\an8}DAIKI SHIGEOKA (28)

52
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:25,638
<i>This summer,</i>

53
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:30,843
<i>another important stage
was waiting for them.</i>

54
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:44,057
{\an8}<i>This is Osaka Shochikuza Theatre
which has trained countless Kansai idols.</i>

55
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:45,592
{\an8}CLOSED

56
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:50,196
{\an8}<i>In order to give back to the theater
which was struggling due to the pandemic,</i>

57
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:56,703
{\an8}<i>five groups would hold a livestream show
to an empty audience in August.</i>

58
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:03,042
{\an8}<i>The first group up would be Johnnys' WEST.</i>

59
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:14,821
<i>Preparations began over a month earlier.</i>

60
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:18,925
It's really hard.

61
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,761
There's so much stopping and starting.

62
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,298
<i>Until now,</i>

63
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:29,535
<i>many of Johnnys' WEST's songs
and dance numbers have been fast-paced.</i>

64
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:34,641
<i>However for this show, they were trying
a more mature and sensual dance</i>

65
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:38,011
<i>with smaller movements
that were actually harder.</i>

66
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:46,819
I see.

67
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:52,191
<i>Furthermore, the masks would torment them.</i>

68
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,096
I spun around too much. I'm going to puke.

69
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:59,632
-I'm out of breath.
-How about we...

70
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:04,637
We want to show that
we're growing one step at a time.

71
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:08,341
It would be great
if our voices can reach people.

72
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:11,177
No idea if it'll work though.

73
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,084
<i>For this show in Shochikuza,</i>

74
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,286
<i>members who can play instruments</i>

75
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:23,923
<i>like the guitarist Hamada
were given solo parts.</i>

76
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:31,230
<i>That night,</i>

77
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:36,536
<i>Shigeoka practiced alone
into the early hours of the morning.</i>

78
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:41,741
-Here?
-Yes.

79
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:42,675
Right.

80
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:44,510
I need to make it sharp.

81
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:45,678
Sorry.

82
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,749
{\an8}IT'S NOT WRONG

83
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:55,188
{\an8}MEETING YOU, BELIEVING IN OUR DREAMS

{\an8}BARING OUR FANGS AT THE ANSWER

85
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,996
{\an8}GOODBYE TO INATTENTION

86
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:07,967
{\an8}I'M ME AND MYSELF

87
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:13,906
<i>There was a time when Shigeoka became
overly fixated on what he wanted to do.</i>

88
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:21,447
<i>Alone and isolated, these are the words
his bandmates shared with him...</i>

89
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:27,620
{\an8}IT'S NOT WRONG

90
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:36,129
We're idols,

91
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:42,034
but we don't really have much of
the sweet, picture-perfect idol image.

92
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:44,170
So even if we mess up...

93
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:47,140
I mean, we mess up a lot.

94
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,776
I might be getting stupider.

95
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:52,945
So does that mean
you're okay with showing flaws?

96
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:54,414
That's totally fine.

97
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,416
I think we're all okay

98
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:59,218
with being embarrassed.

99
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,687
We're all pretty strong mentally.

100
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,561
{\an8}<i>They paid their dues
back in their Jr. days.</i>

101
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:11,798
{\an8}<i>While each of them were in a unit,</i>

102
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:14,500
{\an8}<i>they had no seniors to teach them.</i>

103
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,135
{\an8}<i>So at every show,</i>

104
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:19,272
{\an8}<i>the seven boys would share ideas</i>

105
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,941
{\an8}<i>to make the best show they could.</i>

106
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:25,411
2014
CD DEBUT PRESS CONFERENCE

107
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:28,648
<i>They were finally able to debut</i>

108
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:31,184
<i>ten years after KanJani8</i>

109
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:33,953
<i>in 2014.</i>

110
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:39,725
<i>The seven of them asked
and somehow won the chance to debut.</i>

111
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:45,865
Ain't it great?!

112
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,402
<i>Coming back to Osaka for this show,</i>

113
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:54,307
<i>the first place they went was where
they held their debut press conference.</i>

114
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,177
It's really one step at a time.

115
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:01,280
That was also true before we debuted.

116
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:05,918
It's a big deal how we've made it this far
without losing anyone.

117
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,788
It's important to remember why we started.

118
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:11,791
I'm glad I got
this opportunity to do that.

119
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,730
<i>The dome concerts were meant to prove</i>

120
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:21,567
<i>that the path the seven
of them walked together</i>

121
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:23,970
<i>was not wrong.</i>

122
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:32,044
{\an8}DECEMBER 24, 2016
FIRST CONCERT IN KYOCERA DOME OSAKA

123
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:33,779
{\an8}<i>They first proved themselves</i>

124
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,815
{\an8}<i>two years after their debut.</i>

125
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:38,918
{\an8}<i>But they haven't had
another opportunity since.</i>

126
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:43,322
<i>They were meant to play the domes
again this year after a four-year hiatus,</i>

127
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,558
<i>but that was canceled.</i>

128
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:54,834
<i>The seven members were at Kyocera Dome
this day to shoot a video.</i>

129
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:58,871
<i>They sang their new song
that they were going to perform here.</i>

130
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:08,848
"SHOKO"

131
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:40,880
<i>It's really frustrating that
we couldn't do it this year.</i>

132
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:43,149
But we can leverage this feeling...

133
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:46,652
We'll make it back here one day.

<i>It's two weeks
until their Shochikuza show,</i>

<i>and one member was
taking on a new challenge.</i>

137
00:09:57,964 --> 00:09:59,665
A year-long gap is scary.

138
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:01,067
That's true.

139
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:03,803
-This is 1,500 millimeters?
-Give or take.

140
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:07,239
This will be our first time
doing it from this height.

141
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,145
<i>A backflip from this platform,</i>

142
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:14,880
<i>nicknamed a "platflip."</i>

143
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:19,986
{\an8}<i>They made it 30 centimeters taller
than the show they did a year ago.</i>

144
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:28,327
Yes, thank you.

145
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:32,164
<i>With his amazing athleticism
and experience at the move,</i>

146
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:34,300
<i>Kiriyama succeeded on his first try.</i>

147
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,839
<i>Meanwhile,
this was Kamiyama's first attempt ever.</i>

148
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,075
That was scary!

149
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:45,645
TOMOHIRO KAMIYAMA

150
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:47,913
<i>Jumping backwards is scary.</i>

151
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:50,416
Here I go.

152
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:54,987
Yes!

153
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:12,838
You can do anything you set your mind to.

154
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:16,442
I want to send that message to everyone

155
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,643
by doing this.

156
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:25,151
<i>Next is Kotaki.</i>

157
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:27,486
NOZOMU KOTAKI

158
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:34,060
You okay?

159
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,903
<i>How can he brace for the landing?</i>

160
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:47,540
How many more can I do?

161
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:50,042
Good luck.

00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,388
Okay.

165
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:04,390
All right.

166
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,460

00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,019
<i>with the video streamed live.</i>

171
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:46,432
<i>Any mishaps will be broadcast unedited.</i>

172
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:51,337
-Want to get close?
-Let's try it.

173
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:54,507
Maybe we should have just one back row.

174
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:56,375
-Want to try side-by-side?
-Okay.

175
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:02,548
<i>The hardest challenge they are
undertaking for this show is this...</i>

176
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:06,952
<i>A performance with mirrors.</i>

177
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:12,258
<i>With their backs to the seats,
they perform to their own reflections.</i>

178
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:20,633
<i>Additionally, the Jr. members
have to move the mirrors.</i>

179
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:30,609
<i>The seven members sing while
completely surrounded by the mirrors.</i>

180
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:43,389
Okay.

181
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:45,324
Singing inwards has more impact,

182
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:48,394
so for this song don't look back.

183
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,762
Understood.

184
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:53,866
<i>It doesn't have to be a costly production,</i>

185
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:57,136
<i>but they all come together
to create their stage.</i>

186
00:13:57,703 --> 00:14:00,406
<i>This is how they started out.</i>

187
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:09,815
Using mirrors or other common objects
in a creative fashion is something

188
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:11,884
we've done a lot in Shochikuza.

189
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:14,687
We've done a lot of creative productions.

190
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:17,456
So incorporating some new technology

191
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,859
isn't something we've really done.

192
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:25,831
I would like to put on a show
that can inspire others to persevere.

193
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:28,701
Nice.

194
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:32,238
<i>These handheld fans instilled with love</i>

195
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:35,774
<i>have given them strength
from their supporters.</i>

196
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:41,146
<i>It only took ten days for fans
to send nearly 10,000 of them.</i>

197
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,849
WEST + YOUR FANS = 1

198
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,751
They're cute.

199
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:47,486
I bet they were hard to make.

200
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,754
HAPPY BIRTHDAY

201
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:50,456
They're so impressive.

202
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:51,690
GIVE US YOUR LOVE!

203
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:53,492
I want people to see this.

204
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:56,262
{\an8}<i>How should they respond</i>

205
00:14:56,762 --> 00:15:00,933
{\an8}<i>to their fans' love and their crew's
hard work and dedication?</i>

206
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,868
HUMAN MIRACLE
TAKAHIRO HAMADA

207
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:07,606
I'm so grateful for our crew.
I need to let it show every chance I get.

208
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:10,209
"Hold on, I'm not doing enough."

209
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:13,646
That's how I feel.

210
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:16,048
I need to set a good example.

211
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:19,051
You know? For our juniors.

212
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:22,087
I need to be a good role model.

213
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:25,824
<i>Around this time,</i>

214
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:28,761
<i>they were rehearsing that special move.</i>

215
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:34,867
Nice!

216
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,101
That looked painful.

217
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,238
Want more pads?

218
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:42,007
<i>Kotaki was giving it his all.</i>

219
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:44,643
Absorb the landing.

220
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:49,181
Ow!

221
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:50,616
Absorb it.

222
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,285
Ow.

223
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:57,356
<i>All he needed was to absorb the impact.</i>

224
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,859
<i>That is what everyone thought...</i>

225
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,198
{\an8}AUGUST 1

226
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:09,034
{\an8}<i>Johnnys' WEST's final rehearsal.</i>

227
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:11,704
{\an8}<i>It was time for the platflip.</i>

228
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,775
<i>Kotaki is on the left.</i>

229
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:27,686
<i>Something was off after his landing.</i>

230
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:37,129
{\an8}ONE HOUR BEFORE GOING LIVE

231
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:38,230
{\an8}Excuse me.

232
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:40,065
That hurts there.

233
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:40,966
Here?

234
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:44,570
Something on the inside of my heel...

235
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:45,738
That hurts?

236
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:47,339
It might be bad.

237
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,377
It's probably just a bone contusion,

238
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:56,148
but there's a possibility that you
may have slightly fractured something.

239
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:59,351
<i>What will happen to the performance?</i>

240
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:03,989
I'm so frustrated.

241
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:07,292
They cut the platflip from the show.

242
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:11,397
I hate this.

243
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:14,967
Can you still dance?

244
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:18,404
I'm honestly not sure given this pain.

245
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:28,981
We're about one hour out.

246
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:33,652
I'm ashamed.

247
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:44,997
<i>Just then, Shigeoka plays
that song from the green room.</i>

248
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,439
<i>"It's not wrong."</i>

249
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:05,617
<i>For their younger selves who strived here
when nobody knew their names...</i>

250
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,056
This is where
the seven of us first played.

251
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:13,459
We were in different groups,

252
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,929
but this is where we spent our youth.

253
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,364
We grew up here.

254
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:22,634
This is our home.

255
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:24,937
{\an8}TEN MINUTES TO GO

256
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:26,772
{\an8}<i>It's because this is their home...</i>

257
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:30,075
That looks painful.

258
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:31,110
Are you okay?

259
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:32,778
I'm okay.

260
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:36,248
You've got a little limp.

261
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:39,084
<i>Kotaki</i>

262
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:42,721
<i>decided he would take the stage.</i>

263
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,091
Let's deliver happiness

264
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:48,827
to all of Japan from our home of Osaka!

265
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:50,395
Let's go!

266
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,698
Let's put on a good show with our crew!

267
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:54,166
Let's go!

268
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:56,902
Yeah!

269
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,245
<i>The curtains were drawn.</i>

270
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,980
JOHNNYS' WEST

00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:11,517
Shochikuza is the place of our youth!

272
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:16,121
It's been a while. Let's go!

276
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:46,111
Thank you very much.

277
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:49,281
Thank you very much.

278
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:51,683
Thank you very much.

279
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,185
Thank you, cameramen!

280
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,487
Thank you to the lighting technicians!

281
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:58,390
<i>And to Kotaki...</i>

282
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:00,158
This is Non's birthday cake.

283
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:02,861
I drew his face here.

284
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:06,231
I think it came out pretty nice.

285
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:10,002
The artistry was indeed good.

286
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,438
-It's almost a waste.
-Nice.

287
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:14,506
Is it good?

288
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:16,708
Maybe I'll have some too.

289
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:19,111
I'll have Non's leg.

290
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:20,946
My leg?

291
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:25,317
What do you think an idol's role is?

292
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:27,786
I guess it's to really do anything.

293
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:30,589
Entertain the audience while having fun.

294
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:34,126
They just need to continue
doing that one simple thing

295
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:37,729
for as long as they can.

296
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,902
<i>Simply go one step at a time.</i>

297
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:48,140
{\an8}Ready?

298
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:51,810
{\an8}<i>On the next</i> RIDE ON TIME<i>,
it's Naniwa Danshi.</i>

299
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:53,645
{\an8}<i>Their special summer...</i>

300
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:57,049
{\an8}It's frustrating when you
think it was COVID's fault.

301
00:21:57,616 --> 00:21:59,551
{\an8}<i>The stage suddenly taken from them...</i>

302
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:01,687
{\an8}Ow!

303
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:06,091
{\an8}<i>But they continued to search
for what they could do as idols.</i>

304
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:09,294
{\an8}I don't think that we're special.

305
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:12,030
{\an8}We have to do what we can.

306
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:15,334
