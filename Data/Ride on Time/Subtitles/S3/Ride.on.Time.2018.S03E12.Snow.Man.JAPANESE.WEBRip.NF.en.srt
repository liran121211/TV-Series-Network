{\an8}<i>They spent years training,</i>

The canceling of a debut tour...

25
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:45,105
is something I don't think
has ever happened.

26
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:49,442
All our fans were waiting for it.

27
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:51,945
We were ready to do it any time too.

28
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:56,883
<i>And after waiting for seven months...</i>

29
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,853
-Wow!
-Excellent!

<i>The time had finally come.</i>

31
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,825
The first day of our debut concert!

32
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:07,560
Yeah!

33
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:10,430
-Ready to get pumped up?!
-Yeah!

34
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:11,598
Here we go!

35
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:13,366
Alright!

36
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:15,068
Let's do this!

37
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:21,040

MARCH 2020

40
00:02:55,975 --> 00:03:00,847
<i>The debut concert's rehearsals started
in March of last year.</i>

41
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,919
Good morning!

42
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:09,055
-Give me a hand!
-You kind of changed.

43
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:14,827
<i>The very first order of business
was a briefing on the stage costumes.</i>

44
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,799
<i>The part they were most concerned
about was...</i>

45
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:26,539
I think there's a lot going on
in the waist area for many of us.

46
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:28,775
This is when we're moving a lot.

47
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:32,645
I think if we have less attached,
our dancing stands out more.

48
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:33,913
That's true, yes.

49
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,049
Making that the priority may be good.

50
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:39,852
Having the dancing, the moving...

51
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,821
-As the main focus?
-Yes.

52
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,691
More so that the moves can be seen...

53
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:45,825
Yes.

54
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:46,893
Okay.

55
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:54,901
<i>For Snow Man,
the dancing is their lifeline.</i>

56
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:16,055
<i>What's essential to their dance
is their acrobatic moves.</i>

57
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:26,899
You go like this and if you do that...

58
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:30,169
<i>One of the key people
in those performances is Sakuma.</i>

59
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:32,171
Think of it as pulling in the legs.

60
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:34,240
{\an8}My arms are stopping here, right?

61
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:35,875
{\an8}Yeah, so right now, this is...

62
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,210
{\an8}DAISUKE SAKUMA (28)

63
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:41,981
You're not jumping backwards,
so your body isn't moving back.

64
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:43,449
It's probably my arms.

65
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:44,917
HIKARU IWAMOTO (27)

66
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:47,754
<i>Iwamoto is also a key person.</i>

67
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,790
You go up to here by yourself,

68
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:54,093
but Koji will spin you
the rest of the way.

69
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,363
I understand the image
of what you're saying.

70
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:04,570
<i>The cancellation of their debut concert
was announced just moments later.</i>

71
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:09,876
{\an8}RYOTA MIYADATE (27)

72
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:14,080
{\an8}<i>Miyadate put into words the emotions
stirring within their hearts.</i>

73
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,086
I feel like this is typical for Snow Man.

74
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:27,994
Because Snow Man has experienced a lot
and overcome many tough times,

75
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:34,901
and now we've sort of hit
yet another even bigger wall.

76
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:39,105
If we can't break through it,

77
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,141
even if we make our debut in many things,

78
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:50,750
I think... we'll be defeated.

79
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:54,087
-You see this as a test?
-That's right.

80
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:55,722
SEPTEMBER 2020

81
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:56,889
<i>September.</i>

82
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:04,130
<i>Their debut concert was decided
to be held with no audience,</i>

83
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,199
<i>and their rehearsals resumed.</i>

84
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:11,237
Recalling it is easy, so let's do it.

85
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:13,272
No, I don't think we remember it.

86
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,676
One and two! Three and four!

87
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:19,545
And five and six, seven and eight!

88
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:20,513
Wasn't it this?

89
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,948
Oh, it's this!

90
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:27,987
-Go home!
-Once more!

91
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,789
Koji is center and...

92
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:31,124
I'm this way.

93
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:32,625
And...

94
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,900
It's the one where you start dancing
from the middle...

95
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:43,903
<i>The effects of a half-year break
are indeed great.</i>

96
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:52,578
<i>Even so, there was one mission
Fukazawa wanted to accomplish.</i>

97
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:03,790
<i>It was regarding a concert program
that included their senior groups' songs.</i>

98
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:06,726
And from here, there's that kind of...

99
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:10,997
I want to do a concert
using just our own songs.

100
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:13,433
I was wondering
how everyone felt about it.

101
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:14,734
-I see.
-Right.

102
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:16,836
If we can go this far, let's do it.

103
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:19,639
If so, we don't have to worry
about the video.

104
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:21,507
Then I'll go ahead and...

105
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:28,047
<i>Since the journey to their debut was long,
they have a lot of original songs.</i>

106
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:33,586
This one is in the beginning, right?

107
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:36,722
<i>By structuring the program
with just their own songs,</i>

108
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,692
<i>they wanted to share that journey
with their fans.</i>

109
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:41,394
Yes. So...

110
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,963
-So that's our full set?
-Yes.

111
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:48,968
Performing only Snow Man's songs
at a debut concert

112
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:52,071
will also become a hot topic.

113
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,974
Thankfully, we were given many songs.

114
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:58,377
So I think we can probably give
a very Snow Man-like,

115
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:02,582
good presentation of ourselves.

116
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:27,940
<i>The concert was now just a day away.</i>

117
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:37,283
<i>The stadium was lit up
with each of the members' colors.</i>

118
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,818
OCTOBER 21, 2020
REHEARSAL

119
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,822
Oh, what's all this?

120
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:45,091
-I'm honestly excited!
-Awesome!

121
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:46,926
The display alone is insane!

122
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:48,194
It's super pretty!

123
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:49,962
Watch your step.

124
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:57,770
<i>The stage set had dynamically scaled up
from their pre-debut days.</i>

125
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:02,775
Now, let's see.

126
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:04,176
Whoa!

127
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:06,045
-Fire!
-Woo!

128
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,714
-Awesome!
-Awesome!

129
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:13,352
Thank you very much!

130
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:16,222
It's blazing!

131
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,360
<i>The stadium's center walkway
to the stage are lifts.</i>

132
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:24,897
Amazing!

133
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:27,800
<i>They each even get their own.</i>

134
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:38,110
<i>Everything was moving smoothly
toward the concert.</i>

135
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:46,886
<i>However...</i>

136
00:09:56,796 --> 00:10:01,267
<i>Sakuma who is the key person
in the acrobatics is acting strange.</i>

137
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:06,372
Where are our girlfriends?

138
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,910
Which leg was it? The right?

139
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:12,745
I sprained it.

140
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,513
-You got stuck?
-What?

141
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,748
The gap?

142
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:17,850
-Yeah, I got in the gap.
-Ah, that.

143
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:20,519
Ugh, damn it!

144
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:26,525
We are the nine guys, Snow Man!

145
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,396
<i>He could only watch over the acrobatics...</i>

146
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:35,167
Yeah!

147
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:38,871
What is with that dance?! Do it right!

148
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:48,381
Good work, everyone!

149
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:52,051
Thank you very much!

150
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:54,120
See everyone tomorrow!

151
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:55,254
Please excuse us!

152
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,991
Now I've done it. Everyone, I apologize!

153
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:00,693
No, it's no problem.

154
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:05,364
I apologize!

155
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:07,600
I'll seriously do my best with this!

156
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,836
Is it okay to film?

157
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:11,837
Yes.

158
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:18,144
Injuries. I don't like injuries.
I don't want people to know my injuries.

159
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:22,281
For the fans, it doesn't really matter,
you know?

160
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:25,084
Um, they're paying to see us...

161
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:29,288
so me getting hurt may be sort of rude.

162
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:33,426
Well, I was honestly waiting
very eagerly for it.

163
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:34,694
Seriously.

164
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,731
But even if you push yourself now,
it'll be no good if it gets worse.

165
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:40,232
That's true.

166
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:45,304
So that's where the other members
will seriously help out.

167
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:48,474
They'll take all sorts of measures
to accommodate me.

168
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,643
I'm grateful for them. Seriously.

169
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,112
It can't be helped. It happens.

170
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:56,549
I always do this
right before the actual show.

171
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:59,618
It's typical.
Injuries are bound to happen.

172
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:01,921
That's how difficult your role is.

173
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,160
<i>"Tomorrow, I'll go as far as I can."</i>

174
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,695

DAY OF THE DEBUT CONCERT

176
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:22,641
-Smile for this last one.
-Yay!

177
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,277
<i>It's the day of their debut concert.</i>

178
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:28,180
Okay, thank you.

179
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,582
Alright! Let's do this!

180
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:31,751
The first day of our debut concert!

181
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:33,586
Yeah!

182
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:36,388
-Ready to get pumped up?!
-Yeah!

183
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:39,291
-Will you all enjoy it?!
-Yeah!

184
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:41,761
Let's all do this with a smile.

185
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:42,828
Here we go!

186
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:44,663
Alright!

187
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,298
Let's do this!

188
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:48,501
Let's do it!

189
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:50,469
OCTOBER 22, 2020

190
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:54,640
Let's get this party started!

191
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:25,764
-Daisuke Sakuma!
-Woo!

192
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:28,467
Snow Man!

193
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,269
-Snow Man!
-Snow Man!

194
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:37,643
Wow!

195
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:41,614
Thank you!

196
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:47,353
<i>The nine of them each gave
their whole heart to that stage.</i>

197
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:54,693
I had the dream of becoming
Japan's best entertainer in the future...

198
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:57,229
and came to this agency.

199
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:01,700
And now, I am a member of this Snow Man...

200
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:04,503
having our debut concert.

201
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,706
Many people said it was impossible.

202
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:12,144
"You can't do it."
"You'll be a backup dancer forever."

203
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:15,447
"Snow Man is too timid."

204
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:21,887
"Even when there's a chance to MC
at their senior groups' concerts,

205
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:24,056
everyone just steps back."

206
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:29,495
But... those timid guys are now

207
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:35,267
proudly standing on stage as the main act.

208
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:42,074
I... have a habit of keeping
all my problems to myself.

209
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:45,611
I never discuss them with anyone...

210
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:47,513
Uh...

211
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:51,116
But despite that...

212
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:58,924
The really... insecure parts of me

213
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:04,163
were supported by my fellow members,
and they've really saved me.

214
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:09,134
There were really rough times
when I was a Johnny's Jr. for 15 years,

215
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:11,003
but now I'm extremely happy.

216
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:13,939
When I see everyone

217
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:18,043
standing here like this
they look very dependable.

218
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:21,613
Right now, my throat
and body are worn out...

219
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:25,417
and the skin on my feet is worn out too.

220
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:27,486
But still...

221
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:34,927
we managed to get through these nine
performances that we gave our all to.

222
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:40,833
It sure was
a once-in-a-lifetime debut concert.

223
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:44,036
To our dear staff who support us daily

224
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:47,606
and above all,
to all of you who always support us...

225
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:55,381
we wanted to show our appreciation
through our performance.

226
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:59,418
After joining Snow Man...

227
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:08,594
my way of thinking and my attitude
toward entertainment really changed.

228
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,496
That was, more than anything,

229
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:15,100
thanks to these eight members
who've shown me a great example.

230
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:18,837
I've come to realize
that these eight members

231
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:23,375
are the reason why I am able to
perform here like this now.

232
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:28,247
Snow Man is just awesome!

233
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:29,615
Snow Man.

234
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:32,751
Thank you very much for today!

235
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:36,188
{\an8}Thank you very much!

236
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:41,727
Now, it's showtime! Please go on.

237
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:44,029
Please go on!

238
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:50,569
{\an8}<i>At the end of the year,
Snow Man's schedule was growing busier.</i>

240
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:14,093
Thank you very much!

241
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:19,331
<i>And now, they were about to stand
on the stage of their dreams.</i>

242
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,634

244
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,240
<i>They had to withdraw from</i> Kohaku.

245
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:33,011
<i>Miyadate's infection with
COVID-19 had been identified.</i>

246
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:38,150
<i>The nine members had hit
yet another big wall.</i>

247
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:40,919
SNOW MAN BACKS OUT
OF NEW YEAR'S PERFORMANCE

248
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:43,455
JANUARY 6, 2021

249
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:45,491
<i>And so, the new year started.</i>

250
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:51,497
Good morning.

251
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:53,398
Good morning.

252
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,734
Good morning.

253
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,035
Happy New Year.

254
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:58,403
Happy New Year.

255
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:02,841
<i>After finishing the two weeks
of quarantine,</i>

256
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:05,611
<i>the members finally got together.</i>

257
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:09,882
Good morning!

258
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:10,983
Good morning!

259
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:12,451
Did you watch <i>Kohaku</i>?

260
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:16,021
I watched <i>Kohaku</i>.
I made sure to watch all of it.

261
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:21,226
It should have been difficult
for SixTONES to contact us,

262
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:26,398
but before they went on air,
they went out of their way

263
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:32,104
to tell us that they'd work hard
for Snow Man too.

264
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,106
That made me very happy.

265
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:38,010
And, well, it's true that we actually
couldn't go on <i>Kohaku</i>,

266
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:42,181
but I'm sure SixTONES was able
to pick up on Snow Man's feelings...

267
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,617
and they expressed them
for us on <i>Kohaku</i>'s stage.

268
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,953
That's what I thought watching it.

269
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,321
Yeah, so...

270
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:53,358
I thought I should watch it and I did.

271
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:55,994
Hello! We're Snow Man!

272
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:59,798
Yay!

273
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,000
<i>Snow Man's second year after debuting</i>

00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:10,642

{\an8}"NAMIDA NO UMI WO KOETE IKE"

277
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:31,964
I've always wanted to protect this group.

278
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:34,466
It's smashing good weather!

279
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:50,682
That's why my back
is killing me right now.

280
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:07,399
{\an8}The things people say are impossible...
I kind of want to challenge those.

281
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:20,812
{\an8}Seriously, you only live life once.

282
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:24,616

<i>The next episode features the seven-member

{\an8}<i>It's their second year on the main stage.</i>

287
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:44,803
{\an8}<i>What is the new challenge they face
in their dance performance?</i>

288
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:50,776
<i>"You're with Johnny's, right?"
"You can't dance, right?"</i>

289
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:55,280
As members of Johnny's, we can't have
people like that underestimating us.

290
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:57,115
Dance, huh...

291
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:59,451
That's all I've ever done.

292
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:01,887
We need to shine brighter,

293
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:04,222
and confidently stand on stage.

294
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:08,260
It's not like I can say
that I can't move anymore.

295
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,629
I can't be crying about it.
