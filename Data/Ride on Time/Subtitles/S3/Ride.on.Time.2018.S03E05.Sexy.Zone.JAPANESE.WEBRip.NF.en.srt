1
00:00:02,569 --> 00:00:05,605
<i>This year, October 29.</i>

2
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,240
<i>Yokohama Arena.</i>

3
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:12,479
<i>On this day,
in a venue shrouded in silence,</i>

4
00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:17,150
<i>there was a group preparing for
a concert to create a new era.</i>

5
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:22,422
<i>Sexy Zone.</i>

6
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:26,359
Livestreaming has its own benefits.

7
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:30,196
All five of us will be there
with that in mind.

8
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:35,568
So I think it will be
a good concert in its own way.

9
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:42,208
<i>The tour scheduled to start in March
was canceled due to the pandemic.</i>

10
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,345
<i>After eight months,</i>

11
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:50,050
<i>an online concert without an audience
was the answer they found.</i>

12
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:53,887
{\an8}<i>Nine years since their debut.</i>

13
00:00:58,091 --> 00:00:59,325
I'm under pressure.

14
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,928
I've never not been under pressure.

15
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:04,964
I've always felt anxiety with this group.

16
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:05,965
FUMA KIKUCHI (25)

17
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:10,103
"The next place will be
found by you and no one else."

18
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,404
KENTO NAKAJIMA (26)

19
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:16,376
{\an8}<i>And the feelings about
the one year and nine months</i>

20
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:19,779
{\an8}<i>that they spent apart from
their teammate on hiatus.</i>

21
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:20,880
{\an8}TO THEIR SPECIAL TEAMMATE

22
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:25,752
The four of us and Matsushima
agreed to give each other some space.

23
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,021
He's like Sexy Zone's...

24
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:31,858
adhesive, but really
more like a sort of glue.

25
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:36,196
<i>For the fans who kept waiting,</i>

26
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,932
<i>the five become one.</i>

27
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:41,768
Here we go.

28
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:42,669
SO MATSUSHIMA (22)

29
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:45,405
My hands are so sweaty.

30
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:50,310
{\an8}<i>Here, nine years after their debut
as the youngest group ever,</i>

31
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:53,146
{\an8}<i>is their real conflict.</i>

32
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:59,152
{\an8}<i>Eight tumultuous months until the concert.</i>

33
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:02,889
Alright, let's pump this up!

34
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:06,092
Yeah!

35
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:30,350
<i>This is documentary series</i> RIDE ON TIME.

36
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:48,768
{\an8}<i>November, 2011.</i>

37
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:52,906
{\an8}<i>Their first song "Sexy Zone"
fueled their debut.</i>

38
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:55,708
I'm Kento Nakajima!

39
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:59,579
<i>At their debut,
the eldest, Kento Nakajima, was 17.</i>

40
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:01,414
Ready to love each other?!

41
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:02,949
FUMA KIKUCHI

42
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,185
<i>Fuma Kikuchi was 16.</i>

43
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:06,519
Can I hear your voice?!

44
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:08,621
I'm Shori Sato!

45
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,623
<i>Shori Sato was 15.</i>

46
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,825
Have you been waiting for us?!

47
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:13,927
In this venue...

48
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:16,095
<i>So Matsushima was 13.</i>

49
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:17,330
...can you make some noise?!

50
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:19,966
Hello, I'm Marius Yo.

51
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:23,303
<i>The youngest, Marius Yo was 11.</i>

52
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:24,304
More!

53
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,605
MARIUS YO

54
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:27,807
I love you all!

55
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:32,345
{\an8}<i>Their average age was just 14,4 years old.</i>

56
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:35,281
{\an8}<i>In the history of Johnny's,</i>

57
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:38,051
{\an8}<i>they are the youngest group ever to debut.</i>

58
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:45,692
{\an8}<i>From 2013, two years after their debut,
they continuously performed on Kohaku.</i>

59
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:49,128
{\an8}<i>They were seen as an elite group.</i>

60
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:55,635
<i>Normally, they'd work for several years
in Johnny's Jr. before debuting</i>

61
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:58,938
<i>by dancing behind their seniors,
gaining experience.</i>

62
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:00,106
Sexy Rose.

63
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:06,312
<i>According to Shori Sato...</i>

64
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:14,287
Because we started at a very young age,

65
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:17,290
I was always under pressure.

66
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:21,261
That was the only way for me.

67
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:24,530
I couldn't do anything.

68
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:28,101
"Marius, do it right!"
That was what it was like.

69
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:32,505
"You mustn't make dance mistakes."
I got that a lot.

70
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:36,209
I wondered if I was
dragging everyone else down.

71
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:40,580
That caused a lot of anxiety.

72
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,284
<i>For Matsushima and Marius,</i>

73
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,986
<i>it was less than a year
until they debuted.</i>

74
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:53,926
<i>Then, in 2018,
something unexpected happened.</i>

75
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:55,995
FACE OF 24HOUR TELEVISION

76
00:04:56,062 --> 00:05:01,868
<i>Three months after they were the main
personality for</i> 24HOUR TELEVISION<i>...</i>

77
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:06,873
{\an8}<i>On November 2018,</i>

78
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:11,978
{\an8}<i>Matsushima went on medical hiatus.</i>

79
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,084
<i>Since then, they have been
hoping for Matsushima's return</i>

80
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,952
<i>and continued as a four-man group.</i>

81
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:30,029
<i>The documentary coverage began March 4.</i>

82
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:31,364
MARCH 4

83
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:39,672
<i>The four had ten days before the concert
and were at the height of rehearsals.</i>

84
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:43,910
It's not your first fitting, is it?

85
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:45,445
This one is the first.

86
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,285
The design, the materials,
we look at it all.

87
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,822
I think the length...

88
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,892
Maybe make it a bit longer?

89
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:02,128
With a layered effect,

90
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:05,365
we can increase the volume and the length.

91
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:09,435
Yeah, like more volume in the front?

92
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,872
Like make it more similar to Shori's?

93
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:14,540
Long on half.

94
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:17,510
Yeah, like this but on the left.

95
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:20,680
A little longer, with more volume.

96
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:22,315
For the amount of volume,

97
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,284
it would be better
if it was about the same.

98
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:27,086
Five, six, seven.

99
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:31,357
<i>They weren't just busy with constumes.
They also had rehearsals.</i>

100
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:38,297
<i>The eldest leads the group.
Kento Nakajima.</i>

101
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:40,466
Bang! And back.

102
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:43,569
...kind of thing.

103
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:45,972
Use those movements a bit more.

104
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:48,741
This movement isn't
the focus of this song.

105
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:51,144
It's just a base to make everything crisp.

106
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,211
Okay.

107
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:54,747
<i>During his solo song,</i>

108
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:58,284
<i>the highlight is this
impeccable dance with Johnny's Jr.</i>

109
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:05,024
<i>Nakajima is busy appearing
in dramas and variety shows.</i>

110
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,932
<i>At this time, he was shooting
a drama scheduled to air in April.</i>

111
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:18,037
I was balancing the filming
and rehearsals at the same time.

112
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:21,007
So I am a little behind the others.

113
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:24,777
I have to get good results anyway.

114
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:27,847
I feel pressure and responsibility.

115
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:33,219
<i>And the youngest, Marius, who is twenty,</i>

116
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:37,256
<i>is trying a stage routine
he thought of for his solo song.</i>

117
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:38,758
It's magic.

118
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:43,129
Marius said he wanted to do it.

119
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:45,665
How can I put it?

120
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:50,269
It's a magic trick where
a doll inside a box turns into me.

121
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:59,445
<i>Marius, who was only 11 when he debuted,
is now contributing to staging.</i>

122
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:04,350
I get so nervous that I can't move.

123
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:10,022
The best way to gain confidence
is to just rehearse over and over.

124
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:13,226
So these ten days are going to
be very important.

125
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:17,730
Everyone's trying extra hard,
since we're entering our tenth year.

126
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:25,371
<i>This is their second time
doing a concert as a four-man group.</i>

127
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:29,775
<i>The tour starts in Fukui,
and goes to nine locations.</i>

128
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,477
POP×STEP!? TOUR.

129
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:35,581
<i>The song they prepared for the encore</i>

130
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:39,118
<i>was their debut song, "Sexy Zone."</i>

131
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:45,191
<i>But within this song,</i>

132
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:48,361
<i>for Kikuchi who had always
calmly observed the group,</i>

133
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:50,496
<i>there was a big conflict.</i>

134
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:53,733
I'm under pressure.

135
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:56,502
I've never not been under pressure.

136
00:08:56,569 --> 00:09:00,006
I've always felt anxiety with this group.

137
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:04,310
We can be proud we've lasted ten years.

138
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:09,215
But we haven't done anything
memorable in the ten years.

139
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:13,920
We haven't transcended "Sexy Zone."
Transcended our debut song.

140
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:18,024
"Have we made any memorable songs?"

141
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,227
If you ask someone who's not our fan,

142
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,864
I wonder how many songs they could name.

143
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:28,568
The place Mr. Johnny gave us,

144
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:31,737
and the place we find for ourselves.

145
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:34,574
We have to...

146
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:40,212
face it and think about how to do that.
That's the situation.

147
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:47,053
<i>The place they have to find on their own.</i>

148
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:52,391
<i>This feeling was also shared by Nakajima.</i>

149
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,361
Now that Mr. Johnny is gone...

150
00:09:56,662 --> 00:10:00,900
"The next place will be
found by you and nobody else."

151
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,604
I feel like he's telling us that.

152
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:12,411
<i>Debuting as the youngest group ever,</i>

153
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:16,716
<i>they carried the burden of others'
expectations for these nine years.</i>

154
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:23,456
<i>What we found was not
their glamorous popstar image,</i>

155
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:26,525
<i>but their own selves
facing reality head-on.</i>

156
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:34,367
<i>In this way, Shori Sato
prepared for the concert</i>

157
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:36,369
<i>by increasing his rehearsal time.</i>

158
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:40,973
The songs as well, on this album...

159
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:46,579
The new songs are all really hard to sing.

160
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:50,650
I installed a wireless system
in my home this year.

161
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:52,918
At my place.

162
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:56,889
I can't just blast the speakers at home,

163
00:10:56,956 --> 00:11:01,360
but it's a wireless mic
and a system to provide the sound.

164
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:05,631
So I want to use that to practice at home.

165
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,201
<i>Breaking out of their shells.</i>

166
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:11,203
<i>Finding a new place.</i>

167
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:15,841
<i>Each of them felt a determination
leading up to the concert.</i>

168
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:17,943
MARCH 6

169
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:22,848
<i>On March 6th, in order to add
something new to their performance,</i>

170
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:24,250
<i>they came to this place.</i>

171
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:30,556
We've got something specially made
for our center stage.

172
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,092
It's constructed in a unique way.

173
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,895
And we're like,
"Let's tread those boards."

174
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:39,999
We've never done this before.
It has a pretty unique movement.

175
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:49,075
<i>For several years, Kikuchi has been
compiling ideas for concert direction.</i>

176
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:58,150
<i>Each time, there's a variety
of performances to thrill fans.</i>

177
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:11,297
<i>And this time, they chose
this stage equipment.</i>

178
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:14,533
<i>It reaches over ten meters.</i>

179
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:16,669
Turning!

180
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,606
<i>It leans at an angle while turning.</i>

181
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:25,311
<i>The audience can see every bandmate,
no matter where they are seated.</i>

182
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:29,582
Will it be okay?

183
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:31,650
About the slipping...

184
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:37,590
<i>On this unstable stage,
they check to see how well they can dance.</i>

185
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:41,093
So your right leg...

186
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:06,819
Okay!

187
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:09,688
<i>How will this machine be used?</i>

188
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:12,024
This looks scary even from behind.

189
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:13,793
It's scary.

190
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:17,463
This time, we'll use tempo
and flashy visuals

191
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:23,235
to suggest more and more
exciting things will happen.

192
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,938
This'll be the big highlight.

193
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:30,142
It's a big challenge. If we mess this up...

194
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:32,244
I'll panic.

195
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:35,614
<i>And on this day...</i>

196
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,659
The flames are out...

197
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:48,727
They're all out.

198
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:54,066
<i>Happy birthday, dear Fuma</i>

199
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,570
Yay!

200
00:13:57,636 --> 00:14:01,574
<i>...birthday to you!</i>

201
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,275
So, are you ready?

202
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,913
Sure. Unlike you...

203
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,616
No, no, no. This was just...

204
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:11,784
It was just a joke.

205
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:15,287
We always joke around like this.

206
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,957
I want to have a fun 25th year, too.

207
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,726
I'll make it
an even better year than my 24th.

208
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,128
-Thank you!
-Thanks.

209
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,496
Congratulations.

210
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:34,340
<i>But the following day,
something unexpected happened.</i>

211
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:42,548
{\an8}<i>Due to the novel coronavirus,
the first concert in Fukui was postponed.</i>

212
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:46,886
{\an8}<i>Then the national tour schedule
had to be changed.</i>

213
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:47,887
{\an8}CONCERT POSTPONED

214
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:50,089
And the back...

215
00:14:57,763 --> 00:14:59,698
<i>Four months later...</i>

216
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:02,501
JULY

217
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:07,573
-Good morning!
-Good morning!

218
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:09,074
Good morning.

219
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:16,882
Sorry about the masks.

220
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:22,421
<i>On this day, they got an
important announcement from their staff.</i>

221
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:29,461
<i>In July, the four were brought together.</i>

222
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:34,967
We've considered the situation
and as Johnny's and as Sexy Zone,

223
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:38,504
we'd like to start our tour.

224
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:42,341
Currently, we plan to begin
on August 21 at Osaka Castle Hall.

225
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,410
That's the current schedule.

226
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:46,378
Wow.

227
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:51,283
<i>August 21. The plan to
restart the concerts.</i>

228
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:55,554
<i>It was the fans who encouraged them.</i>

229
00:15:56,121 --> 00:16:00,559
We made a refund liaison and
handled it as Johnny's representatives.

230
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,928
But 90% of ticket holders said

231
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:07,766
they wanted to wait
for a Sexy Zone concert.

232
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,001
-Amazing.
-Wow.

233
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:12,604
They have tuitions and food expenses.

234
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:15,574
I think it was really tough for them.

235
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:19,144
-I want to do the concert.
-We do, too.

236
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:20,913
-Truly.
-We want to do it.

237
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,614
-I really want to.
-Yes.

238
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:30,756
<i>But the biggest priority
was keeping the fans safe.</i>

239
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,896
Since it'll be summer
and knowing how hot it'll be,

240
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:40,966
we made this with an open shape.

241
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:43,002
<i>For an unprecedented situation,</i>

242
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:45,704
<i>they made strict preventative measures</i>

243
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:49,641
<i>and planned to tour
from August to October.</i>

244
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:55,414
90% of them are waiting.

245
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:59,518
I want to get to them as soon as possible

246
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:03,255
and show them what we've created.

247
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:05,691
That was at the top of my mind.

248
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:10,996
<i>Once again, they begin
the journey to find their place.</i>

249
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:13,799
Okay, this time it's for keeps.

250
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:14,700
Roll it!

251
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:20,539
<i>In the midst of that,
they filmed a music video.</i>

252
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:25,044
<i>Their 18th single, "RUN."</i>

253
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:46,065
<i>It was as though the four had
poured their determination into it.</i>

254
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,302
{\an8}THERE'S NO MEANING IN BEING RIGHT

255
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:56,175
{\an8}JUST FIND YOUR OWN ANSWER

256
00:17:56,642 --> 00:18:00,379
{\an8}WON'T IT END? CAN'T IT END?

257
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:05,117
{\an8}WE STILL HAVEN'T MADE ANYTHING LASTING

258
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:10,422
<i>"We still haven't made anything lasting."</i>

259
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:26,638
<i>The four couldn't decide on
the placement for the song.</i>

260
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:35,481
When I think of it as a tour
during the pandemic,

261
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:40,786
we could finish with "Yuki 100%"
and then reveal "RUN."

262
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:45,691
I think that would
resonate the most with our audience.

263
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:49,528
It would leave the biggest impression

264
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:52,164
if it's after "Yuki 100%" for sure.

265
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:54,566
The momentum of the group

266
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:59,138
has to be prioritized, so I think "RUN"
towards the end would feel good.

267
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:01,874
Run as hard as you can
and cut the goal tape.

268
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:07,045
I'm all for putting "RUN."

269
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:10,883
But if we do, we need
some movement don't you think?

270
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:13,986
So we'll do choreography
for the first chorus,

271
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:17,322
but with the second chorus,
we could have movement.

272
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,626
<i>Then Nakajima brought up</i>

273
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:23,662
<i>the other meaning of this song.</i>

274
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:25,197
You know,

275
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:30,269
this song also includes
our feelings for So, right?

276
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,404
"Nothing can start without you."

277
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,873
It's a song with a message

278
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,642
to connect to his hope.

279
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:39,511
This could be that bridge-building song.

280
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:49,721
<i>This was about Matsushima,
their dear bandmate who is on hiatus.</i>

281
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:54,059
<i>According to Sato...</i>

282
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:57,462
Matsushima's having treatment,

283
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,299
and information from outside,

284
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:05,370
or the things we do
could mean more pressure for him.

285
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:07,706
The four of us and Matsushima

286
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:12,644
agreed to give each other some space.

287
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:17,683
That's what we've been doing.

288
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:24,089
<i>And this was the t-shirt
they made for the tour.</i>

289
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:29,261
<i>Each member is holding a can
colored with the member colors.</i>

290
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:35,834
<i>In his left hand, Marius has
Matsushima's color, the green can.</i>

291
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:43,075
If we say, "It's Matsushima,"
people might take it the wrong way.

292
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:45,510
They can take it however they like.

293
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:50,148
Matsushima's here,
and we're all taking a break together.

294
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:53,318
We wanted to make that sort of atmosphere.

295
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:55,954
That's how I see it, anyway.

296
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,157
AUGUST

297
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:00,559
<i>And then...</i>

298
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:05,030
<i>Sitting there was...</i>

299
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:08,500
{\an8}Did you meet up often?

300
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:11,937
{\an8}We weren't like, meeting all the time.

301
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:13,005
A few times?

302
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:17,075
Yeah, a few times.
Visiting when we can, type of thing.

303
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:20,078
Hey, let's go.

304
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:22,981
Yay!

305
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:23,882
Woo!

306
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,217
It's So!

307
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:28,120
Yes. Sorry for being away for so long.

308
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:30,222
I'm So Matsushima from Sexy Zone.

309
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:37,763
When we sing it, the meaning
really is mainly about So.

310
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:39,931
{\an8}<i>On the next</i> RIDE ON TIME<i>...</i>

311
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:42,434
{\an8}Yay!

312
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:43,669
{\an8}It's So!

313
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:44,569
{\an8}Yes.

314
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,939
{\an8}<i>Finally, they were five once more.</i>

315
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:53,979
{\an8}<i>Behind that were the unspoken feelings
for their bandmate.</i>

316
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:56,281
{\an8}He might not come back.

317
00:21:56,348 --> 00:22:00,585
{\an8}If So is happy that way, then that's okay.

318
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:04,589
{\an8}I can't say, "Please, I want to perform
as five. Please come back."

319
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:09,428
{\an8}As long as he's healthy.
That's all that matters.

320
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:14,966
{\an8}<i>There are places they can find
only as a five-man group.</i>

321
