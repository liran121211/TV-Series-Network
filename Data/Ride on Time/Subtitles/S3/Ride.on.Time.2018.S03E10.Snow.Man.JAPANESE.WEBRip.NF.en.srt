{\an8}<i>The nine-person idol group, Snow Man.</i>

4
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:29,329
{\an8}<i>Their greatest weapon is their outstanding
physical abilities and dance skills.</i>

5
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:41,808
<i>Following their debut single,
their second hit, "KISSIN' MY LIPS,"</i>

6
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,877
<i>also sold over a million copies.</i>

7
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:56,289
{\an8}From here on,
I think we have infinite possibilities.

8
00:00:56,356 --> 00:01:00,727
{\an8}The things people say are impossible
or a bit difficult...

9
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:03,596
{\an8}I want to kind of challenge those.

10
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:10,737
<i>The group's leader, Hikaru Iwamoto,
also choreographs the dances at times.</i>

11

a fashion magazine model.</i>

25
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:48,575
{\an8}Later, he goes the comedy route...

26
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:49,542
{\an8}REN MEGURO (23)

27
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,211
He's smooth, right?

28

33
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:09,729
{\an8}Yes.

34
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,231
I hope it comes out well.

35

Thank you very much.

36
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,235

38
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,172

48
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:37,684
<i>and were scheduled to again this year,
but it was canceled due to the pandemic.</i>

49
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:47,293
<i>For all the anticipating fans,
the stage play would be made into a movie.</i>

50

<i>July.</i>

53
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:04,877
Good morning! Thanks for coming.

54
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:10,450
<i>Rehearsals started after
their long stay-at-home life ended.</i>

55
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:16,689
<i>The most concerning problem
was that their stamina had declined.</i>

56
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:19,025
-Can we start?
-Please!

57
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,521
Should we do it again?

58
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:50,757
Man, we have to bust our butt again.

59
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:59,232
Don't forget that we decided
the numbers today.

60
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,667
Okay.

61
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:06,005

00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:20,386
Five, six, seven...

66
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:24,857
During the stay-at-home period,
did you train on your own?

67
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:26,526
Well for Kabuki...

68
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:31,230
It was right during that period
that Kabuki was decided.

69
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:34,701
I did whatever workouts I could at home.

70
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:35,601
I see.

71
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:40,273
I would run outside while
wearing a mask pretty often.

72
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,474
You ran?

73
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:44,077
I ran. I just kept running.

<i>he won second place
in a global dance competition.</i>

78
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,428
BORN JUNE 27, 2003

79
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:06,632
<i>Afterwards, he entered the agency
and performed in a different unit,</i>

80
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,569
<i>but his expressive dance style
was acknowledged</i>

81
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:12,605
<i>and he was chosen to be Snow Man's center.</i>

82
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:19,212
MARCH 2019

83
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:23,750
<i>This is Raul when he had

-Here we go, next.
-Okay.

86
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:43,102
<i>But the speed of his growth was fast.</i>

87
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:51,344
<i>And at the filming
that took place this day...</i>

88
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:55,181
Okay, let's begin filming
if everyone's ready.

89
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:02,488
<i>...Raul displayed a chilling performance
unbelievable for a 17 year old.</i>

91

<i>Abe, Fukazawa, and Raul's original dance.</i>

92
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:25,244
<i>Raul's solo part is all freestyle.</i>

93
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:32,251
Rolling. Music in three, two...

94
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:00,947
Cut!

95
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:03,850
And cut! Remember those poses, everyone.

96
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:09,755
Um, Raul, in the last cut,
your right hand...

97
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,658
Your right hand was raised
when you finished.

98
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:16,496
-So you'll start from when it's raised.
-Okay.

99
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:17,997
Okay, then.

100
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:20,132
{\an8}Please start with the hand raised.

101
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,134
{\an8}RECREATING THE MOVES FOR EDITING

102
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:26,138
{\an8}-Okay, looks very good. Once more please.
-Okay.

103
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:30,810
Once again...

104
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:34,480
<i>This is the part of the hook
where it gets the most emotional.</i>

105
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,016
And cut!

106
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:14,987
Um, let me make sure,
but can you do the same moves?

107
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,522
No, I can't.

108
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:18,324
-You can't, huh?
-No.

109
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,827
Right.

110
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:25,898
<i>The director was forced
to rethink the filming plan.</i>

111
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,335
You can whatever you want now.

112
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:32,071
Cuts don't matter,
so do it in one shot please.

113
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:32,972
Okay.

114
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:38,077
Music in three, two...

115
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:13,746
<i>Age is seriously, in a sense,
just a title and that's it.</i>

116
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:17,049
<i>"You can't bring out certain elements
at this age."</i>

117
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:20,753
<i>I've never really thought of things
like that before.</i>

118
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,657
<i>Like, yeah,
I express what I want to express,</i>

119
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:28,094
<i>and I just work hard,
so that people can enjoy it.</i>

120
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:36,936
Cut! Okay!

121
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:38,638
And cut!

122
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:43,309
You danced as you felt it,
so you can't recreate it.

123
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:45,811
I said I couldn't do it, because I can't.

124
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:46,846
Yeah.

125
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:50,249
Well, but I think this song
is where a woman...

126
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,719
I don't have a woman.

127
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:57,223
Um, so I think of an imaginary woman.

128
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:59,592
I imagine my favorite woman.

129
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,427
Oh?

130
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:05,665
I want to be in love with her,
but I can't.

131
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,833
Like I think, "How come?"

132
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:11,504
-But that's the same with me.
-Right?

133
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,505
Yeah.

134
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:14,573
Why are you chiming in?

135
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,508
Same with me.

136
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:17,710
When I sing, that's how I feel.

137
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:19,712
But Fukka has a woman.

138
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:21,414
He just needs to imagine her.

139
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,049
Ah, a woman? I have one.

140
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:25,451
She's called a fan.

141
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,619
You...

142
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:28,187
He gave it away.

143
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:29,822
You sure know me!

144
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:36,829
<i>And at last, one of the biggest highlights
of</i> Takizawa Kabuki ZERO<i>...</i>

145
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:40,733
<i>"Fukkin-daiko."</i>

146
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:49,408

147
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:07,159
-Okay, once we reset we'll start.
-Okay.

148
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,829
All right.

149
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,965
Now, let's go into the actual take.

150
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:14,667
Okay.

151
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:19,271
Rolling. Ready, action!

152
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:29,482
"FUKKIN-DAIKO"

153
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:48,567
And cut!

154
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,171
My hand's peeled.

155
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:54,573
It hurts so bad.

156
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,242
Nice.

157
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,816
It's the same on my right.

158
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:06,652
Um, we're going to do
the same thing once more.

159
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:08,354
From a different angle.

160
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,623
-Okay.
-Okay.

161
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,760
<i>Unlike a stage performance,
it won't end after one run.</i>

162
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:17,029
<i>That is the tough part about a movie.</i>

163
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:19,899
...we'll run it three times
so get some rest now.

164
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:20,900
Okay.

165
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:53,499
Okay, good!

166
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:03,576

<i>These three have an even tougher pose.</i>

171

-Ready?
-Yes.

172
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,727
Okay, let's do it.

173
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:25,130
Rolling. Ready, action!

174
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:42,314
<i>The device continues to spin.</i>

175
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:50,656
<i>And it continues to recline further down.</i>

176
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:11,677
And cut!

177
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:15,281
Please pull them back up.

178
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:19,652
Watch your heads.

179
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:25,024
Koji, you need a trash bag?

180
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:26,692
I'm okay!

181
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:27,993
Are you okay?

182
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:30,596
Yes!

183
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:46,011
The actual recording is finished,
but right now...

184
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:51,150
<i>Iwamoto had a bitter experience
on this stage as well.</i>

185
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,624
<i>January of last year.</i>

186
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:02,194
<i>It happened during
the first</i> Takizawa Kabuki ZERO.

187
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:06,565
This is super scary.

188
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,701
-Dropping you down now.
-Okay.

189
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:12,571
<i>During the Nezumi Kozo rehearsal...</i>

190
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:16,976
That was close!

191
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:19,812
You've taken quite a chunk out.

192
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,381
-This is a test of endurance.
-Yeah.

193
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:23,949
<i>His shins got scraped.</i>

194
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:25,718
-Here it comes.
-Right.

195
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:27,953
Now I've gone and done it.

196
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,355
Come on, man.

197
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:31,290
Things have been hectic...

198
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:33,292
The pain doesn't bother me.

199
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:37,696
I just wonder what the hell I'm doing.

200
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:50,709
I still have a proper scar from my injury
during the previous <i>RIDE ON TIME</i>.

201
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:51,710
That?

202
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:53,145
It's still there.

203
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,513
-Oh, wow.
-This.

204
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,415
Ah, it's quite a scar.

205
00:16:56,482 --> 00:17:00,552
I think it's an incident
I'll remember all my life.

206
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:04,423
If <i>RIDE ON TIME</i> wasn't there,
I'd probably have cried.

207
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:08,527
-No way.
-Seriously. It seriously hurt.

208
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:10,729
During this time's coverage,

209
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:15,367
one of my goals is
to not incur any injuries.

210
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:17,102
Yeah.

211
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:26,378
<i>Meanwhile, the movie's filming
was about to reach its climax.</i>

212
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:35,220
{\an8}EDO WONDERLAND, TOCHIGI PREFECTURE

213
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:40,459
{\an8}<i>Filming was progressing for</i>
Takizawa Kabuki ZERO 2020 the Movie.

214
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:50,436
Rolling! Ready, action!

215
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:53,505
<i>The name of this play
is Nezumi Kozo Jirokichi.</i>

216
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:57,109
It's not that easy to become
the next Nezumi Kozo!

217
00:17:57,176 --> 00:18:01,113
That's right! You'll never find anyone
that can replace Mr. Nezumi!

218
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:06,251
Remember Mr. Nezumi wished for Edo
to be filled with smiles and no tears.

219
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:10,189
Chief Shinkichi, please work hard
and become the next Mr. Nezumi!

220
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:17,996
{\an8}<i>Iwamoto is a detective who people want
to become the next Nezumi Kozo.</i>

221
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:23,669
<i>With his comical personality,
Fukazawa is a young townswoman.</i>

222
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:28,774
Follow me, Shinnosuke Tokudawara!

223
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:33,745
{\an8}<i>The austere and manly Miyadate is
a constable who protects the city of Edo.</i>

224
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:35,681
{\an8}RYOTA MIYADATE

225
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:41,687
{\an8}<i>Sakuma and Watanabe humorously play
a kooky pair of brothers.</i>

226
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:44,957
{\an8}SHOTA WATANABE, DAISUKE SAKUMA

227
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,664
{\an8}<i>The serious Abe was purposely
assigned the role of the cat.</i>

228
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:54,867
I wonder how I look.

229
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:04,810
<i>And the thieves who raid Edo
are Raul, Mukai, and Meguro.</i>

230
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,514
{\an8}The Edo that Nezumi dreamed of...

231
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,683
{\an8}<i>The three show off their acting
as the villains.</i>

232
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,485
{\an8}Now, go.

233
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:16,421
{\an8}Find the whereabouts of Shinkichi.

234
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,523
{\an8}KOJI MUKAI

235
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:19,291
Izo!

236
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:22,294
If you are to get in our way,

237
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:25,030
I will...

238
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:28,033
kill you.

239
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:35,674
<i>This performance is a chance
for each to gain great experience.</i>

240
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:40,379
Clear up!

241
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:44,049
Ready, action!

242
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:50,255
<i>The mix of different elements on this day
made for a very Snow Man-like scene.</i>

243
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:33,865
And cut!

244
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:41,406
<i>What is</i> Takizawa Kabuki ZERO <i>to them?</i>

245
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,742
I almost laughed so many times.

246
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:48,714
School. It feels like a school.

247
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:54,386
I think Takizawa Kabuki is all about
growing from a performance standpoint,

248
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:58,223
but there's also personal growth.

249
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:04,363
It's a place where you can learn
all of those things at once.

250
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:07,766
Like show business school.

251
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,605
<i>September.</i>

252
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:17,442
<i>Raul was starting another new challenge.</i>

253
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:20,912
Cut!

254
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:23,448
Okay! Good.

255
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,118
{\an8}HONEY LEMON SODA FILMING

256
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:31,356
{\an8}<i>He was chosen as the lead role in a movie
that's planned to be released next summer.</i>

257
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:36,495
{\an8}I'm very thankful for this opportunity.

258
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:43,535
{\an8}If I could bring the results
of this solo gig back to the group,

259
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:45,937
{\an8}that would be really nice.

260
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:47,472
Look sharp now.

261
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:48,807
{\an8}<i>Next episode,</i>

262
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:52,044
{\an8}<i>each member of Snow Man
shines with their own light.</i>

00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:58,617
{\an8}<i>The things they etch in their hearts
as they polish themselves...</i>

264
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:01,086
{\an8}Okay!

265
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:07,025
{\an8}Within that tense atmosphere,
I was challenging myself the entire time.

266
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:13,332
{\an8}<i>...and the true feelings revealed
by the 17-year-old center.</i>

267
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:15,434
{\an8}That's why I didn't quit.
