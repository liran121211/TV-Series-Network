00:00:03,303 --> 00:00:06,406
<i>January, 2021.</i>

2
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:10,910
{\an8}<i>On the year of their tenth anniversary,</i>

3
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:13,747
{\an8}<i>this group made a new start.</i>

4
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:19,953
Hello everyone.

5
00:00:21,554 --> 00:00:24,457
Hello!

6
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:29,729
Seriously?

7
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:33,833
Oh, hello.

8
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:41,241
<i>Sexy Zone.</i>

9
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:49,849
{\an8}We all said, "We'll do it"
and gave the okay.

10
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:54,954
{\an8}Each one of us wanted to find
a new side to ourselves

11
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:57,824
{\an8}that we haven't seen before.

12
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,656
<i>This is documentary series</i> RIDE ON TIME.

13
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:39,065
{\an8}<i>In 2011,</i>

14
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:42,402
{\an8}<i>with an average age of 14,4,</i>

15
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:45,405
{\an8}<i>they became the youngest group
to debut from Johnny's.</i>

16
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:51,578
{\an8}<i>They appeared on Kohaku
six years in a row from 2013.</i>

17
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:01,321
<i>In 2018, they were chosen</i>

18
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:04,958
<i>as the main personality
for</i> 24HOUR TELEVISION.

19
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:14,134
{\an8}<i>After that, their mood maker,
Matsushima, went on medical hiatus.</i>

20
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:17,737
Okay, this time it's for keeps!

21
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:18,638
Roll it!

22
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:21,441
{\an8}<i>Since then,</i>

23
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:26,012
{\an8}<i>the remaining four continued working,
wishing for Matsushima's return.</i>

24
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:32,785
<i>This is when it was made.</i>

25
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:37,023
<i>The song that seemed
to show their hearts.</i>

26
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:42,428
{\an8}NOTHING CAN START WITHOUT YOU

27
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:47,133
{\an8}RAISE OUR JOINED HANDS HIGH

28
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,104
{\an8}DON'T STOP, DON'T STOP

29
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:54,440
{\an8}WE'VE ONLY JUST BEGUN

30
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:56,843
You know,

31
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:01,147
this song also includes
our feelings for So, right?

32
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,283
"Nothing can start without you."

33
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:05,752
It's a song with a message

34
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:07,520
to connect to his hope.

35
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:10,356
This could be that bridge-building song.

36
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,110
{\an8}2020 AUGUST

37
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:33,179
{\an8}<i>The one who returned was...</i>

38
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:41,454
<i>Matsushima, after a year and nine months.</i>

39
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:43,223
<i>And then...</i>

40
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,358
Let's just have fun.

41
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,126
-Okay!
-Yeah! Let's go!

42
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:48,761
Yeah!

43
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:50,630
-Woo!
-Thirty seconds.

44
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:59,005
{\an8}<i>Their concert was postponed
due to the pandemic,</i>

45
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,773
<i>but after eight months,</i>

46
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,310
<i>it became an online concert,
with no audience present.</i>

47
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:35,975
<i>However...</i>

48
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,184
Is this position alright?

49
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:46,819
Should I stand here?

50
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:47,720
Crouch a bit.

51
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,589
{\an8}<i>In December of last year,</i>

52
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:52,992
{\an8}<i>Marius Yo, due to poor health,</i>

53
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:57,063
{\an8}<i>announced he would take
a temporary leave from show business.</i>

54
00:04:58,464 --> 00:04:59,299
{\an8}Okay!

55
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:00,933
{\an8}-Okay!
-Thank you!

56
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,675
{\an8}<i>Then in 2021,</i>

57
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:12,845
{\an8}<i>the four bandmates made a new start.</i>

{\an8}SEXY ZONE
FUMA KIKUCHI (25)

59
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:19,552
{\an8}We are in a rough shape.

60
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:23,623
{\an8}But...

61
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:30,496
So came back after his break.

62
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:34,667
It sort of starts now.

63
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,604
This is where the hard work begins.

64
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:42,442
How can I put it? I feel like...

65
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:45,912
there was more I could have done.

66
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,949
I do feel responsible.

67
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:53,720
But...

68
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,422
even in this state,

69
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:01,794
I can't just be negative.

70
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,531
So is back after all.

71
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:09,168
It's our tenth anniversary as well.

72
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:13,806
On behalf of Marius who is on a break,

73
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:19,145
we should probably try to
have as much fun as we can.

74
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:22,548
In this moment,

75
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:26,719
how much can we enjoy this work?

76
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:30,256
I think that's what's important.

77
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:35,461
{\an8}<i>January 8.</i>

78
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:44,937
<i>Each with their own feelings,
they took a new step forward.</i>

79
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:53,179
{\an8}<i>The choreography for the lead song
from their new album, "SZ10TH."</i>

80
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:55,281
{\an8}Hand in front.

81
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:56,315
{\an8}And your face...

82
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:57,617
{\an8}Face to the side.

83
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:00,486
It's the same as at the start?

84
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:02,021
It's the same.

85
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,091
Yes, that's it.

86
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:11,397
<i>The choreography was made by
a team with global recognition.</i>

87
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:17,403
{\an8}<i>With this song, they look to the future.</i>

88
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:26,446
You need to be aware of stopping
for 0,02 seconds or it doesn't work.

89
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:29,916
Right now, you're like this.
You need to stop here.

90
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:31,184
Okay.

91
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:34,654
One, two, three, four.

92
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,922
Okay, sorry.

93
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:39,125
Stop just for a moment.

94
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:40,960
One, two, three, four.

95
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:44,630
Try it with the music.

96
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:45,531
Tyrant!

97
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:49,569
I'm so tired.

98
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:13,860
Some parts are tricky,
so go over them on your own.

99
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:16,996
The parts where you're like,
"Oh, that wasn't good."

100
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:19,332
Go over those and do your best.

101
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:20,600
-Okay.
-Great.

102
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:28,975
It's about mental state.

103
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,911
Above all, those who are supporting us,

104
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:36,983
like all our fans...
When I think about how they feel,

105
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:41,120
I don't have time to stop right now.

106
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:45,191
There were times

107
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:49,262
when the group seemed like
it would stop over the past ten years.

108
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:53,633
But my motto has always been
"Never stop moving forward."

109
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:57,069
The bandmates are
working hard with me.

110
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:02,975
The one who is on a little break is too.

111
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:06,279
Everyone has their own life to live.

112
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,849
So we're all just trying to do our best.

113
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:18,357
{\an8}<i>Then came the filming of the music video.</i>

114
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:28,568
There's not a single word of Japanese
in this whole song.

115
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:32,004
In fact, when we chose this song,

116
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:36,142
they were like,
"This'll be quite a challenge."

117
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:39,412
"Do you really want to do it?"

118
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:45,518
But we all said, "We'll do it"
and gave the okay.

119
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:50,623
Each one of us wanted to find
a new side to ourselves

120
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,559
that we haven't seen before.

121
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:56,796
That was pretty deep, right?

122
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:00,800
That was pretty deep.

123
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,238
{\an8}Like any group, we have to
always be changing.

124
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:09,008
{\an8}We have to always be doing something new.

125
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:14,580
{\an8}Making our dance that precise
is also something new.

126
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:19,352
As a beginning for Sexy Zone's challenge,

127
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:21,487
I think it's a really good start.

128
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:29,629
<i>It's their first time making
a dance number with all English lyrics.</i>

129
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:34,500
Bam, bam.

130
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:39,205
I can't tell the difference.

131
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:40,706
Oh, here.

132
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:45,544
-You can tell when they leave.
-The white is a little clearer.

133
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:47,813
The colors aren't too clear.

134
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:53,753
It's hard to tell the difference
between us and the four dancers.

135
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:00,426
We should change it a bit more.

136
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:05,231
Will this work?

137
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:09,769
<i>They change their outfits,
and shoot it again.</i>

138
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,928
Okay, that's good.

139
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:37,997
Did we do it?

140
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:45,738
Let's use this.

141
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,874
We did it.

142
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:01,020
Above all, it's just fun.

143
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:03,723
That's the best part.
They're having fun too.

144
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:06,058
They're lively.

145
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:12,498
Well, Marius is the one
who's good at English.

146
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:16,268
I can't beat Marius.

147
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:19,171
Even though I'm trying so hard.

148
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,774
I can't win.

149
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,311
I'm defeated.

150
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,347
Defeated by Marius.

151
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:38,057
{\an8}<i>Leading up to their tenth anniversary,
this song shows a new side of them.</i>

152
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:04,950
{\an8}2021 JANUARY 23

153
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:06,952
{\an8}<i>Then on this day,</i>

154
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:10,189
{\an8}<i>they did something for the fans
during the pandemic.</i>

155
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:19,098
Hello. One and a half minutes left.

156
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:20,633
One minute thirty seconds.

157
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:22,001
Okay.

158
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:28,474
Five seconds. Four, three, two...

159
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,744
Here we are. Good evening, everyone.

160
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:35,447
We're Sexy Zone! Yay!

161
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:39,585
Welcome to the first
Sexy Zone Online Meeting.

162
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,421
{\an8}Today, we are online,
reading your comments.

163
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,322
{\an8}We see them.

164
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,691
{\an8}Here on these pads.

165
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:46,659
{\an8}-Wow.
-Pads...

166
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:48,127
{\an8}On these pads.

167
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:50,930
{\an8}-We'll see them there.
-Wow, there are so many.

168
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,065
"Shori is the only winner."

169
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:54,200
"Shori is a genius."

170
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,135
They're all about you.

171
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:58,804
-They're all you.
-Sorry, I'm so self-centered.

172
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:05,244
<i>During the livestream,
comments from fans flooded in.</i>

173
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:12,384
{\an8}<i>This project was made from
the ideas of the members.</i>

174
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,457
{\an8}<i>Last year, in September,</i>

175
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,760
{\an8}<i>a meeting was held
for the tenth-anniversary album.</i>

176
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:24,530
We should use the five-member "RUN."

177
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:26,799
Just for "RUN," I see.

178
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:31,136
These four were the ones
that presented the song

179
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:36,242
and it also really signifies
how they protected Sexy Zone.

180
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:39,845
So I think it's better
if we don't put it on the album.

181
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:40,846
Oh.

182
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:42,348
It could be...

183
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,618
I thought it could be like
a record of that time.

184
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:46,952
I understand.

185
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:50,389
For the fans, collection-wise,

186
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:52,758
I think we should
start from the beginning.

187
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:59,632
I think it's important to reflect back
on all the songs.

188
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:03,903
It might be like creating a concert.

189
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:05,137
I think...

190
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:07,940
We could have fans vote for everything.

191
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:11,243
Yeah, an album made by the fans.

192
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,280
It seems right for the tenth anniversary.

193
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:18,951
There are a lot of good tracks
from the Sexy Zone B-sides.

194
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:23,889
That's ten years' worth
of songs to choose from.

195
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:25,691
Social distance.

196
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,693
As much as possible.

197
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,128
Definitely, right?

198
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:30,796
So we don't make trouble.

199
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:33,399
<i>Each with their own ideas,</i>

200
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:35,901
<i>they planned the anniversary album.</i>

201
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:43,742
{\an8}<i>Announcing the results after
fans voted on the songs</i>

202
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:46,245
{\an8}<i>was the purpose of this fan meeting.</i>

203
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:47,813
{\an8}FOURTH PLACE
"WITH YOU"

204
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,315
That was a good one.

205
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,619
I was surprised this was fourth.

206
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:55,654
I thought it might be first.

207
00:15:55,721 --> 00:16:00,192
After all, it was before
we performed "Sexy Zone"...

208
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:02,861
Yeah, I remember Shori
like this at the start.

209
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:04,830
Stop!

210
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:08,367
-Let me explain. It was choreographed.
-Like you were forced.

211
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:11,904
If I stood like this,
I looked even thinner.

212
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:15,541
I think Sanche said,
"You, stand like this."

213
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:18,377
-Oh, that's why.
-"Be more powerful."

214
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:20,279
It wasn't just me. So too.

215
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:21,647
Yeah, So was like this.

216
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,816
I did! How do you remember?

217
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:27,286
Sanche's grip was so strong though.

218
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:29,855
-Like this. Weren't they strong?
-I remember.

219
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:31,056
-"Like this?"
-"No."

220
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:32,524
"You go like this!"

221
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:35,094
"And Shori, you do this!"

222
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,762
"Yes, sir!"

223
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,298
Rather than ten years of nothing,

224
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:42,835
we have so much to talk about
from the past ten years.

225
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:46,372
I think that's a wonderful thing.

226
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:51,310
I feel like the last ten years
have been very rich.

227
00:16:54,980 --> 00:17:00,853
<i>They began running towards their dream
for their tenth anniversary.</i>

228
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:06,025
Happy New Year.

229
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:10,195
<i>January.
Their tenth-anniversary challenge.</i>

230
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:13,899
The rules will change
depending on the city.

231
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:16,568
I think we'll try for 50%.

232
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,140
{\an8}<i>Their wish was...</i>

233
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:24,076
{\an8}<i>a concert tour with a live audience.</i>

234
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:27,679
It's our tenth anniversary.

235
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:30,416
We want to be able to say thank you.

236
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:33,485
Right?

237
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:40,559
So we're all thinking about
how we can do this.

238
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:45,998
We're all in it together.

239
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:53,539
<i>They can't see what lies ahead,
but they do it for their patient fans.</i>

240
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:58,377
In a Sexy Zone concert,
we always have lasers, right?

241
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:02,014
We could do it a new way.

242
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:04,483
If we're showing each of us off...

243
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:07,086
If we prepare too much
and can't use it all,

244
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:10,322
we should give the lasers
their own place to shine.

245
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:13,358
Which is better?

246
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,561
Like a monument or...

247
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:18,697
And the question of where.

248
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:22,601

250

{\an8}<i>The future they look forward to.</i>

251
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:32,044
Sexy Zone...

252
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:37,850
is a group that can turn
a crisis into an opportunity.

253
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:43,689
Those words really fit the five of us.

254
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:48,160
Despite the pandemic,
our motivation hasn't changed.

255
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:53,799
We're always thinking about what we can do
to give the fans a good time at concerts.

256
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:57,836
But it's really thanks to
the strength of our fans

257
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:01,707
that we've also been able to stay strong.

258
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:04,543
We really do support each other.

259
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:09,047
For the amount of support
they've given us these ten years,

260
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:12,017
we need to thank them properly.

261
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:16,922
By returning it in some way,
and continue to support them too.

262
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:22,327
I always say it, but
"Our hearts are close."

263
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:27,166
We want excitement as well.

264
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:31,537
We were about 14 years old
when we debuted.

265
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:36,408
Even though ten years have passed,
we're still in our twenties.

266
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:40,379
So compared to
other groups and our seniors,

267
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:43,315
I feel like our ten years
have been different.

268
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:46,118
Everyone has an incredible desire.

269
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,121
Of course we do. We're in our twenties.

270
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:51,857
We should be just getting started.

271
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:54,927
I want to make it a special anniversary...

272
00:19:55,861 --> 00:20:00,165
I want to make a tenth anniversary
that suits us, and I think we can.

273
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:02,267
Yeah.

274
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:08,240
Sexy Zone has to get more popular.

275
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:13,612
We still have so much strong competition.

276
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:18,383
We have to beat them.
If we don't, there's no point.

277
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:26,325
Can we keep on being Japan's
Sexy Zone for another ten years?

278
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:31,330
I want to work on being Japan's Sexy Zone.

279
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:34,967
On our 30th anniversary,
we'll still be in our forties.

280
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,602
Everyone.

281
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:42,140
Alright, then let's say 25 years.

282
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:46,545
On our 25th anniversary,
me and Nakajima will be just over forty.

283
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:49,615
Some will be in their thirties.

284
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,185
That's it.

285
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:56,321
I'll accept world fame
on our 25th anniversary.

286
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:59,191
The world's Sexy Zone
on our 25th anniversary.

287
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:01,493
-It's perfect.
-Okay.

288
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,494
Okay.

289
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:08,467
That's it for the dance.

293
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:36,628
Yay!

{\an8}<i>On the next</i> RIDE ON TIME<i>...</i>

{\an8}<i>V6 embraces their 25th anniversary

296
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:47,205
Idol? Am I still considered an idol?

297
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:48,940
What do we do from now?

298
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:52,044
Who are we living for?

We've started, so now we have to do it.

301
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,890
I don't know if I was crazy
or just sucked-in.

302
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:06,491
Could I have been alone?
