00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:17,009
Should I get closer? Maybe 1,5?

169
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:21,013
<i>They make practical changes</i>

170
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,450
<i>to the dance formation and singing parts.</i>

171
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:32,358
<i>Being professionals, they will entertain
their fans regardless of the circumstance.</i>

172
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:38,831
{\an8}There were talks
that it might be canceled,

173
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:43,002
{\an8}but the members came together
and we decided to do it.

174
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:44,503
{\an8}As a group,

175
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:48,174
{\an8}we managed to overcome
a lot of mishaps at Shochikuza.

176
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,511
But the reason why we chose
to do it is for Ohkura,

177
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:57,183
and all the people who have been
looking forward to it.

178
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:59,719
I'm sure Ohkura is the most frustrated.

179
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:03,089
We wanted to stand up there
as the five of us,

180
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:05,624
but I'm sure he wanted it the most.

181
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:09,795
How can we take Ohkura's frustration,

182
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:12,765
and transform it into positive energy

183
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:15,401
that we can deliver to our fans?

184
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:18,938
One, two, three, four...

185
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:23,008
{\an8}<i>They quickly add one of Ohkura's
solo numbers to the set list.</i>

186
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:28,447
{\an8}"BUTTERFLY I LOVED"
OHKURA'S SOLO SONG

187
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:33,185
{\an8}<i>The seats are illuminated green,
Ohkura's color.</i>

188
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:39,625
<i>They also made T-shirts with his photo.</i>

189
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:46,365
Say cheese.

190
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:49,301
You guys don't need to worry about us.

191
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:52,705
If the camera's on you, just go crazy.

192
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:53,606
Okay.

193
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:55,207
If you start going crazy...

194
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:58,511
<i>Ohkura had been the one
mostly looking after the kids,</i>

195
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:01,614
<i>so the rest of the group
takes over in his absence.</i>

196
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:03,682
Okay.

197
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:05,251
Just do that a lot.

198
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:12,158
<i>The curtains are drawn
as Ohkura watches over them from afar.</i>

199
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:16,729
Osaka!

200
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:23,202
"SUKIYANEN, OSAKA."

201
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:58,804
"ZOU"

202
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:33,639
<i>These five men have overcome
numerous challenges as a group.</i>

203
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,345
KanJani...

204
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:41,513
8!

205
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:47,753
{\an8}<i>No matter the crisis,
they've transformed it into strength.</i>

206
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:51,824
Mr. Johnny said

207
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,126
that you have to learn to enjoy it.

208
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:58,063
Don't panic during mishaps.

209
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:01,333
He said how you deal
with a crisis is important.

210
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,903
Well, we managed
to make it through the day

211
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:09,008
without any huge incidents
so I'm relieved.

212
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:16,282
{\an8}<i>Meanwhile, Yokoyama felt
a huge obstacle during this concert.</i>

213
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:17,349
{\an8}Yes, please.

214
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:24,523
Of course I think there is merit to
a livestream concert with no audience.

215
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:29,295
But you know,
I think we're used to playing in front of

216
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,397
an actual audience.

217
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:35,100
We already know that atmosphere.

218
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:38,070
So after experiencing that,

219
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:42,174
I have to admit that it's irreplaceable.

220
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,311
<i>What made him keenly aware of that</i>

221
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:48,180
<i>was the skit segment he performed in.</i>

222
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:51,216
Hey!

223
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,117
What?

224
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:55,054
-What the heck are you guys doing?!
-Hm?

225
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,458
I came here to tell you
that I'm taking center stage today,

226
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:00,759
but Green's not here!

227
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:04,496
So there can't
be a center with four people!

228
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:08,834
<i>There was no response from the audience,
an essential part of comedy.</i>

229
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:11,170
I can't say it!

230
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:12,604
Woohoo!

231
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:17,276
<i>Furthermore, the next groups
to take on the empty venue</i>

232
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:20,512
<i>are the Jr. units
Ae! group and Lil Kansai.</i>

233
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:25,451
<i>Most of their performance
would be awkward skits.</i>

234
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,889
I already talked to Ae! group
and the Kansai Jr. kids.

235
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:34,193
I told them this is going to be
a really tough fight.

236
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:37,463
Not having an audience...

237
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:40,532
How do I put it?

238
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:42,901
They're doing a skit,

239
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:46,505
so it's really difficult
without an audience.

240
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:49,541
JULY 11

241
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:53,278
<i>Preparation for
the skit show began back in July.</i>

242
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:55,114
{\an8}LIL KANSAI

243
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:59,118
{\an8}<i>The livestream show performed by
Lil Kansai and Ae! group</i>

244
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,320
{\an8}<i>would center around skits.</i>

245
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:03,555
{\an8}What about the radio calisthenics?

246
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:04,790
{\an8}What do you mean?

247
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,525
{\an8}AE! GROUP

248
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:11,497
<i>How will they overcome
the obstacle of having no audience?</i>

249
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:20,039
<i>Ae! group has six members
who also play their own instruments.</i>

250
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:22,274
<i>They all have distinct personalities.</i>

251
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:26,945
<i>Yokoyama decided to make use
of that in the skit premise.</i>

252
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:32,818
How about we take off the sunglasses?

253
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,853
{\an8}-No, it's too bright.
-Seriously?

254
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:39,158
{\an8}<i>Their role is to play idols who get
big heads after growing in popularity.</i>

255
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,561
{\an8}That's just as irritating.

256
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:46,398
-The staff must hate you.
-Make up your mind.

257
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:51,637
{\an8}<i>Playing the director and second director
who get involved with Ae! group</i>

258
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:56,875
{\an8}<i>are two Jr. members picked by Yokoyama
who have yet to be in the limelight.</i>

259
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:58,610
{\an8}I'm Okumura.

260
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:00,879
Please accept my apology

261
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,549
for my delayed introduction.

262
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,760
Once he's like, "Woo,"

263
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:16,495
you should stand up slowly.

264
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:18,130
What's your next line?

265
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:20,699
I look forward to working with you today.

266
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:24,503
He's starting his line here,
but you do this the whole time.

267
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:29,341
I look forward to today.

268
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:31,310
<i>As fledgling idols,</i>

269
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:36,215
<i>their drive to rise to higher heights
is what motivates them.</i>

270
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:41,220
Don't look at me and smile.

271
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:43,522
Okay!

272
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:48,760
To introduce myself,

273
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:52,531
I'm the director-assisting
assistant director, or AD,

274
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:53,665
Yuri Oka.

275
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:56,468
Your character feels
a bit busy with the lisp.

276
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:58,470
-Thank you.
-It's not a compliment.

277
00:18:58,537 --> 00:18:59,538
Look, like that!

278
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:02,341
<i>The two who Yokoyama selected
are working hard.</i>

279
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,177
That's it.

280
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:07,546
That's hilarious.

281
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,317
{\an8}<i>It has created an air of competition.</i>

282
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:15,921
{\an8}AE! GROUP
SANO MASAYA (18)

283
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:22,561
What makes me most happy with rehearsal?
I'm happiest when Yokoyama laughs.

284
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:25,631
So right now I'm a little vexed.

285
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:28,233
Yokoyama is laughing the most with Oka.

286
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,003
After rehearsal,

287
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,473
when everyone was saying their goodbyes,

288
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,642
he gave Oka a thumbs up.

289
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,377
We really wanted that.

290
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:45,050
{\an8}But you know, we came up together.

291
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:47,119
{\an8}We're all contemporaries.

292
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,588
Okumura hasn't changed.

293
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:54,893
{\an8}<i>Kojima from Ae! group
comments on his contemporaries' hard work.</i>

294
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,363
Yuri was given more lines.

295
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,666
I'm happy he got more funny parts,

296
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:02,935
but it's like I can't lose to him.

297
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:05,971
And Okumura has tons of lines, too.

298
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,339
Like the narration.

299
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:10,943
I guess the director's role
is to keep things moving forward.

300
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:12,511
So he has a lot of lines,

301
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:16,315
but he had them all
memorized the next day.

302
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:20,219
I'd think I would need to read
the lines from the script.

303
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:22,621
So they make me want to work harder.

304
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:25,424
Their presence is motivating.

305
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,527
-Good work today.
-You too.

306
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:34,233
<i>This friendly rivalry
is a tradition that is passed down.</i>

307
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:39,871
AUGUST 11

308
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:42,941
<i>It's the day of the livestream skit show.</i>

309
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:44,309
SHOCHIKUZA

310
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:46,745
{\an8}FINAL REHEARSAL

311
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:50,249
{\an8}<i>Yokoyama had work in Tokyo,</i>

312
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:53,285
{\an8}<i>so they run the final rehearsal
in his absence.</i>

313
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:02,694
{\an8}<i>Yokoyama selected Oka
for the assistant director role.</i>

314
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:04,663
Good work.

315
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:08,667
{\an8}<i>And Okumura for the director role.</i>

316
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:15,507
The members of Lil Kansai
are here today to audition.

317
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:17,175
Hello!

318
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:19,211
We're Lil Kansai!

319
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,213
It's nice to be here!

320
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,017
<i>The two of them had just come off stage.</i>

321
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:27,753
Okumura, Yoko's on the phone.

322
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:32,324
Hello? This is Okumura.

323
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:34,226
Good morning. Yes.

324
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,294
Yes.

325
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,432
<i>It was a phone call from Yokoyama
who was watching their rehearsal remotely.</i>

326
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:42,668
"That was wonderful, everyone."

327
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:44,536
<i>What happened?</i>

328
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,509
{\an8}<i>Next time, it's the day of
the empty-venue skit show.</i>

329
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:52,878
{\an8}Is this supposed to be fun?

330
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:56,548
{\an8}<i>What is Yokoyama's secret plan?</i>

331
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:00,585
{\an8}<i>They receive messages from their seniors.</i>

332
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:01,687
{\an8}<i>Enjoy yourselves.</i>

333
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:05,290
{\an8}<i>Lil Kansai endures their own trial.</i>

334
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:12,531
{\an8}How do we showcase
something that only we can do?

335
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:14,700
{\an8}We need to work together right now.
