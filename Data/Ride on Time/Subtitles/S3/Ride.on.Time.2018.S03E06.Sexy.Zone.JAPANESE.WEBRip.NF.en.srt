{\an8}<i>Their tour was postponed
due to the pandemic.</i>

2
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:08,308
{\an8}<i>As the group was becoming less active,</i>

3
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:14,114
{\an8}<i>Sexy Zone's 18th single,
"RUN" was released.</i>

4
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:20,220
It's a song that asks us questions.

5
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:23,089
It also says,
"It's our tenth year, let's keep going."

6
00:00:24,557 --> 00:00:28,795
{\an8}<i>Nine years since their debut,
the four stood on a new starting line.</i>

7
00:00:29,996 --> 00:00:33,500
{\an8}<i>There's someone
they're always keeping in mind.</i>

8
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:35,935
{\an8}<i>An important person.</i>

9
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,307
He might not come back.

10
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:46,679
If So is happy that way, then that's okay.

11
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:50,350
I can't say, "I want to perform
as five. Please come back."

{\an8}<i>Everyone thought that

20

<i>But in their hearts...</i>

21
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:55,748
I'm under pressure.

22
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:58,518
I've never not been under pressure.

23
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:02,822
But we haven't done anything
memorable in the ten years.

24
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:06,860
I was always anxious.

25
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,297
There was a lot of conflict too, yeah.

26
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,933
I guess it's just...

27
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:17,537
We didn't have time to prepare

28
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:20,940
before we debuted as Sexy Zone.

29
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,546
{\an8}<i>There was a sense of crisis as a group.</i>

30
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:38,458
{\an8}<i>What's more, So Matsushima
went on medical hiatus.</i>

31
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:46,232
{\an8}<i>And then...</i>

32
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:51,471
{\an8}<i>the national tour scheduled
from March was postponed.</i>

33
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:57,977
{\an8}<i>Each member worked to do what they could</i>

34
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:02,415
{\an8}<i>in a struggle to break out
of their own shells.</i>

35
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:05,552
{\an8}<i>On this day,</i>

36
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:09,489
{\an8}<i>Fuma Kikuchi was recording
a variety program.</i>

37
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:11,291
{\an8}-Could I get a comment?
-Yeah.

38
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,692
For that long?

39
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,696
-It does say 16 minutes.
-That's amazing.

40
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,700
I couldn't last 16 even if I shed blood.

41
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,169
{\an8}<i>In 2008,</i>

42
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:28,107
{\an8}<i>when he was a second year in junior high,
Kikuchi contacted the agency himself.</i>

43
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:35,615
<i>He talks about his attractive image
which is the opposite of his personality.</i>

44
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:41,888
I might be the most negative one.

45
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:45,658
I think there is some frustration
with that, in the group.

46
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,862
"Why is he so pessimistic?"
I think there's a bit of that.

47
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:55,768
<i>That's why he's the one
who sees situations most calmly.</i>

48
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:58,238
Five seconds. Four, three...

49
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:04,410
<i>For him, the place where
he broke out of his shell was variety TV.</i>

50
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:09,882
I do want to be recognized as cool though.

51
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,553
When I walk around town,
people call me "That Naked Guy."

52
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:19,525
I get people saying stuff like,
"I saw you on <i>Endless Pranks Grand Prix</i>."

53
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:23,563
Things like that
have never happened before,

54
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,265
so it was a bit surprising.

55
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:27,467

I think I exude a strangeness,

63
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:15,915

It's about Britain leaving the EU.

that I want to show people.

172
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,566
I think he should promote it more.

173
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:43,502
In that sense, Kikuchi going on

174
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:47,273
those prank shows,
variety shows and all that...

175
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:51,877
I feel like he's on a good path right now.

176
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:56,716
I really like how he isn't
trying to act all cool anymore.

177
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:00,653
<i>According to Kikuchi...</i>

178
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:05,691
I think Nakajima and I
are both a little odd.

179
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:08,928
I do look at things from a step back.

180
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:11,731
Or at least, I try to take a step back.

181
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:14,533
So I think that might...

182
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:18,504
sometimes look emotionally distant.

183
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,073
Well, Nakajima is the eldest after all.

184
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:23,442
I think he has his pride.

185
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:26,946
He sometimes says so himself.

186
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:29,982
But above all, Nakajima is more like...

187
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:35,755
the point-getter.
He's really the shooter after all.

188
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:41,393
So I have to give the assist.

189
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:46,665
I feel like it's my job
to make those passes work.

190
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:50,903
That's what I think.
It really feels like that.

191
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,073
<i>Overcoming many barriers,</i>

192
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,942
<i>the two grew to respect one another.</i>

193
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:03,549
<i>Their readiness
to fight together is the same.</i>

194
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:09,421
<i>And the member who acts
as the group's mediator.</i>

195
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:12,491
<i>So Matsushima.</i>

196
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:18,631
He's an adhesive,
but really more of a glue.

197
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:20,900
As a member of Sexy Zone,

198
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,838
he's really like the sun.

199
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:32,645
Just by being there,
the mood gets lighter.

200
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:37,049
{\an8}<i>There's footage that shows
Matsushima's character.</i>

201
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:38,884
{\an8}It's right there.

202
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:40,553
{\an8}We're getting hungry.

203
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:41,854
SEXY ZONE 5-MAN TRIP

204
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:46,258
<i>This was the bonus content
from their 2018 album.</i>

205
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:50,596
-Oh!
-Whoa!

206
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:52,097
Did it take it?

207
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:53,966
It ate it!

208
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,601
You were robbed? So.

209
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,937
{\an8}That's not fair!

210
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,606
{\an8}Give it back!

211
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:06,045
<i>Matsushima was
the mood maker for the group.</i>

212
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:12,852
<i>As they hoped for his return from hiatus,</i>

213
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:15,621
<i>the bandmates felt conflicted.</i>

214
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:23,028
I really like So as a person,
and I respect him.

215
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:24,897
I just want him to get better.

216
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:30,035
And for example, if that means
he might not come back,

217
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:32,271
If that's the case...

218
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:37,643
If So is happy that way, then that's okay.

219
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:40,079
I can't just say it.

220
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:43,215
Of course it's better with five.

221
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:48,554
I can't say, "Please, I want to perform
as five. Please come back."

222
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:50,990
Yeah.

223
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,928
I wish he could...

224
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:59,365
somehow find a way to be happy.

225
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:01,901
That's how I feel now I guess.

226
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:08,741
{\an8}<i>"RUN" was released on August 5.</i>

227
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:12,444
{\an8}<i>It holds special meaning for the group.</i>

228
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:16,515
Ready? Hi, everyone! We're Sexy Zone!

229
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,484
Yay!

230
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:21,553
To all our supportive fans,
we have some news.

231
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:25,157
Thanks to all of you,
our new single, "RUN"

232
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:28,394
was number one
on the weekly singles charts! Yay!

233
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:32,932
<i>And then, the day arrived.</i>

234
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:37,870
<i>This day was a shoot for the fan club.</i>

235
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:41,674

{\an8}SEXY ZONE
SO MATSUSHIMA (23)

237
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:52,818
{\an8}I'm happy. I am happy.

238
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:58,691
Before, we were always the youngest
so we came to work first.

239
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:01,727
-We'd do our makeup together.
-Yeah, that's right.

240
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:03,862
Good morning.

241
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:04,897
Thanks.

242
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,699
For what?

243
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:07,666
What "thanks"?

244
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:08,867
You did that for me.

245
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:10,235
Of course I did!

246
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:13,205
Wouldn't you say, "Long time no see?"

247
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:15,941
We'd always message each other

248
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:18,911
so it doesn't feel like
it's been a long time.

249
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,380
In the sense of distance.

250
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:22,982
It's scary while sleeping.

251
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:27,753
<i>The same atmosphere as always.</i>

252
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,991
<i>That's how they chose to respond.</i>

253
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,194
You nervous?

254
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,162
I'm super nervous.

255
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,566
-I might pee my pants.
-Nothing's stopping you.

256
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:42,201
Ah, the camera was on.

257
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:45,304
Okay, rolling!

258
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,873
Five seconds, four, three, two...

259
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:49,942
Hello everyone.

260
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,944
We are Sexy Zone!

261
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,714
Today, we have some happy news.

262
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:59,218
We wanted to tell you right away,
so we're making this video.

263
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:00,652
-Yes.
-Everyone, well...

264
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:03,155
-I know you already know.
-That's right.

265
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:04,757
You've been waiting.

266
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:07,659
-Yes, truly.
-Yes, I've been waiting.

267
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:10,662
What shall we do? Should we call him?

268
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:11,563
Or should we...

269
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,432
What should we do?

270
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:14,967
Wanna get him? Shori, go.

271
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,136
-Okay, I'll go.
-You go.

272
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:19,772
Hey, let's go.

273
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:22,508
Yay!

274
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:23,409
Woo!

275
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:24,710
It's So!

276
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:27,613
Yes. Sorry for being away for so long.

277
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,715
I'm So Matsushima from Sexy Zone.

278
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:33,819
It's public. You're coming back.

279
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,021
Yes, thank you very much.

280
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:37,689
Please support us!

281
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:39,458
Please do!

282
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:40,692
Do the honors.

283
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:41,593
This has been...

284
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,462
Sexy Zone!

285
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:45,030
Yay!

286
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:45,931
Sexy Zone!

287
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:48,967
<i>And on this day,</i>

288
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:52,938
<i>the shoot to announce
Matsushima's return ended.</i>

289
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:55,474
It's been so long, I'm still sort of...

290
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,209
Yeah, but it's still so...

291
00:17:57,276 --> 00:18:00,145
I feel like it's all coming back to me.

292
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,147
Uh...

293
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:07,553
{\an8}<i>Later, on the radio program he hosts,</i>

294
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:09,254
{\an8}<i>Sato told the fans.</i>

295
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:13,425
We have announced So Matsushima's return.

296
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:23,202
We've caused everyone to worry
for nearly two years.

297
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:29,441
We've always considered So
to naturally be a bandmate.

298
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:31,043
So it's only natural.

299
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,812
It's really just natural. Yeah.

300
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,515
That's how much... Hmm.

301
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:38,784
How can I put it?

302
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:43,689
So that's why we say, "Welcome home."

303
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:44,790
Yeah.

304
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:50,696
Sexy Zone will go on to be
Sexy Zone in its true form.

305
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:53,999
We'll show you
what Sexy Zone is all about.

306
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:57,236
This was <i>Shori wo Kimi ni</i>
with Sexy Zone's Shori Sato.

307
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,305
Good work.

308
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:06,211
<i>Sato chose his words carefully
and shared his thoughts.</i>

309
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:13,719
{\an8}<i>Soon after his return was the shoot
for the cover of their new song.</i>

310
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:18,056
A photo shoot with the five of us is...

311
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,059
Right? It's been a while.

312
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:24,730
But it feels the same as always.
Just as it was before.

313
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:27,666
I love how nothing has changed.

314
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,568
We already discussed this!

315
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:31,270
Why are you so excited?

316
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:32,204
He's not excited.

317
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:33,906
He's trying to make a good shot.

318
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:36,341
We're setting up all these lights.

319
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:37,643
Don't get in the way!

320
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:39,178
-Shooting!
-Okay.

321
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:40,345
They're shooting me.

322
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:42,581
This feels so extravagant.

323
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:50,355
This is Marius, I'm Matsushima.
We're SoMari!

324
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:55,694
Well done today.

325
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,062
Thank you.

326
00:19:57,763 --> 00:20:02,668
This was the first photo shoot
since I returned.

327
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:06,271
I feel like it'll become
a special memory for me.

328
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:10,642
A different kind of memory than usual.

329
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:13,979
I hadn't worked with the four for a while

330
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:17,082
and each of them had become
a little more mature.

331
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:21,720
Their faces, too.
It was just refreshing to see.

332
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:27,359
They really did keep Sexy Zone going,
that same environment.

333
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:28,527
It's still there.

334
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:32,431
And here I am, trying to
fit back into that, in the right way.

335
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:35,133
At times like that, I listen to "RUN"

336
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:39,171
as I work towards
the goals I set for myself...

337
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,340
As I'm doing that,

338
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:46,912
I can choose to see
negative things as positive.

339
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:49,214
That's how this song speaks to me.

340
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:52,084
And the four members
of Sexy Zone are singing it.

341
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,720
That's the most important part.

342
00:20:54,786 --> 00:21:00,359
We're all doing our best
in the same circumstances.

343
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:03,228
The fact that people I know are singing...

344
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:05,931
That makes me really happy.

345
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:09,434
Though that's probably something
other people can't feel.

346
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:14,006
{\an8}<i>Next, the five appear on a music program.</i>

347
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:15,440
{\an8}FIVE ONSTAGE AFTER 650 DAYS

348
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,144
{\an8}<i>Fighting to catch up.</i>

349
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:22,714
{\an8}I haven't been in front of cameras
in ages.

350
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:25,851
{\an8}When I dance,
I get butterflies in my stomach.

351
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,154
{\an8}<i>The bonds between the five...</i>

352
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:33,625
{\an8}I wish So wouldn't worry.
He can tease, and criticize too.

353
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:35,861
{\an8}I believe in him.

354
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:39,631
{\an8}You don't need to be perfect.
You can just have fun.

355
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:42,234
{\an8}I just want everyone
to look forward to it.

356
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:45,170
{\an8}I'm sure Matsushima feels the same way.

357
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:47,139
{\an8}-So this is B?
-It's the regular one.

358
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:48,273
{\an8}It's not B?

359
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,708
{\an8}Thank you everyone.

360
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:52,611
{\an8}<i>They've only just begun.</i>
