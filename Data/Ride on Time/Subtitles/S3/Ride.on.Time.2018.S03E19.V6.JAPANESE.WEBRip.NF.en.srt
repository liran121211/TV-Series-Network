How long is the show?

3
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:09,576
Four 30-minute episodes.

4
00:00:09,642 --> 00:00:11,211
-Four episodes?
-That long?

5
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:12,746
Two hours?!

6
00:00:12,812 --> 00:00:14,280
-Nothing'll happen.
-Yeah.

7
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:16,383
There won't be any incidents.

8
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:17,817
It's so peaceful.

9
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,587
-Should we fight?
-Okay.

10
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:21,721
Hey, you!

11
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:24,958
-Not young enough to fight.
-Boring, right?

12
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:26,559
Nothing.

13
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:28,161
There must be something.

14
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:31,364
No, we've already done all that
in the last 25 years.

15

<i>It's about a new song which is
exclusively for their fan club.</i>

53
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:48,021
For the project for our fan club,

54
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:52,191
we're asking KREVA to write us a song now.

55
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:57,430
I worked with him in a movie last year,

56
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:02,168
and I'm personally really close to him,
but I didn't ask him.

57
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:08,808
We wanted someone from our generation
to write it, so Avex and Okada talked

58
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:11,711
and KREVA was the only candidate.

59
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:13,613
I talked to KREVA.

60
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:19,686
He said he wanted our ideas and keywords,
so I said we'd give him that.

61
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:25,258
This is the first time the six of us
are communicating with a songwriter.

62
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,060
I wanted to do something new.

63
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:32,532
I thought we'd better do it,
just the six of us.

64
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:39,539
{\an8}<i>Inohara met the members
who'd share the same fate with him</i>

65
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:41,374
{\an8}<i>and debuted when he was 19.</i>

66
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,577
{\an8}<i>His age was right in the middle.</i>

67
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:49,048
<i>He brought the group together
by serving as a bridge</i>

68
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:51,084
<i>between the old and the young.</i>

69
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:55,955
What... What are you rubbing?

70
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,958
I don't know. Something round.

71
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:02,595
-He's not watching. He won't join us.
-Jeez, he won't join us.

72
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:04,964
Nice. I like this group.

73
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:08,301
You sometimes see someone
creating a good atmosphere.

74
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,104
I think I have to be like that.

75
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:14,240
Because many others
are taking serious roles.

76
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:17,910
Okay. Thank you.

77
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:23,916

{\an8}So make good memories.

82
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:42,368
Mr. Johnny told us that
our banter was boring many times.

83
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,271
It was just the worst.

84
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:47,173
I really didn't want to do it.

85
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:51,344
I didn't want to do it
and he would talk about other groups.

86
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,113
Like, "KinKi is so entertaining!"

87
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,783
I said, "Well, that's because
they're a duo."

88
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:58,618
"Being a duo is hard, too."

89
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:01,120
"There are six of you
and you're that boring?"

90
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:02,789
I was frustrated.

91
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:05,591
When it wasn't successful,
it was really bad.

92
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:07,827
I could tell, "Oh, it wasn't fun."

93
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:10,897
-They don't even wear a fake smile?
-Yeah.

98

99
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:30,216
-Are you worried about <i>RIDE ON TIME</i>?
-Yes.

100
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,885
Thank you.

101
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,521
But it's a nice location to film at.

102
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:39,692
That drawing on the wall of
that Toyoko Inn changes periodically.

long-established stores and restaurants

105
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:57,076
And <i>Adomachi</i>,
you'll see it when you're the host.

106
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,212
Like, "Shouldn't we do that thing?"

107
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:03,216
"No, not anymore."
They get rid of things just like that.

108
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:07,053
-Like things they've been doing?
-Yeah, sometimes they just stop.

109
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:12,825
They'd do something new or
go back to the old thing, they're quite...

110
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,928
They're quite flexible.

111
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:20,766
The show has been running
for 25 years. Just like us.

112
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:27,373
Both us and the show have been dealing
with problems that occur on the spot.

113
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,043
When I film three episodes in a row,
I've got to eat something.

114
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:33,713
I'll eat!

115
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:37,917
Fifteen minutes to go.

116
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:40,453
Hello.

117
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,922
-I'm Inohara. Hello.
-Oh, hello.

118
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:01,374
<i>For the livestream concert,</i>

119
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,211
<i>the challenge of mastering a dance
they'd never done before began.</i>

00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:44,083
<i>Performing their song

121
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,966
Awesome. So cool.

00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:01,300
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

123
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:03,536
The problem is if I can memorize it.

124
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,537
-Yoshie.
-Yes?

125
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,372
Do you think we can do it?

126
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,374
Definitely.

127
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,476
-Let's try our best.
-Yes, let's go.

128
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:13,179
It's a rare opportunity
to show off your skills.

129
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:15,047
Yes, thank you.

133
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:29,562
Nice!

134
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:41,507
Let's do the fast arm movement.

135
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:45,911
One and three. Four, five, and six...

136
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:46,979
So fast!

137
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:53,285
Nice!

138
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:58,924
Yeah, that's it. Yes.

139
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,594
Okay, let's do it one more time.

140
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:13,039
<i>Nagano was working on it quietly.</i>

141
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,213
Is your back okay?

142
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,548
-It's fine.
-Healed?

143
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:25,618
I'm not sure, but I can move normally now.

144
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:29,689
The arm movement at the end looked hard.

145
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:31,991
-That's hard, right?
-It is.

146
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:34,126
-It's super fast.
-It's hard.

147
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,395
If you think, you'll be left behind.

148
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:39,565
Like, if I do this,
you'll dodge it this way.

149
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:43,302
Just like that, I have to train it
like muscle memory. Yeah.

150
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,438
"Wait for You" from the top.

151
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:53,012
{\an8}<i>Nagano joined the agency when he was 13,</i>

152
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:57,817
{\an8}<i>and even before V6 debuted, he was active
in TV drama series and so on.</i>

153
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:02,154
{\an8}<i>He became the first to play a hero</i>

154
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,557
{\an8}<i>in a</i> tokusatsu <i>series in the agency</i>

155
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:06,992

{\an8}1996 ULTRAMAN TIGA

157
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:10,963
{\an8}<i>He got a cooking license,</i>

158
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,766
{\an8}<i>and qualifications
to be a vegetable sommelier.</i>

159
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,936
{\an8}<i>He published three books about food.</i>

160
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:22,475
<i>The ingredients in his recipes are
detailed down to their nutritional value,</i>

161
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,410
<i>which shows his personality.</i>

162
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:28,681
What made you get qualified
to be a vegetable sommelier?

163
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:34,687
Well, I've always had an interest in food
for quite a long time,

164
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:40,259
and I didn't have much work to do.
I wasn't busy at all.

165
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:43,562
I was thinking,
"Is there anything I can do?"

166
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:46,699
So I went, "Okay, let's just get them"
and that's it.

167
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,835
I know I'm greedy,
but I want to do various things.

168
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:51,337
Acting, too, of course.

169
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:54,640
V6 is basically my foundation.

170
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:59,278
Because of V6, I got work
and I think it's the same even now.

171
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:04,150
My attitude towards work
is always the same.

172
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:08,320
I want to value every work that I get.

173
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:11,123
<i>Even on this day...</i>

174
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:18,864
You'll see how amino acids work
and why you need them.

175
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:22,301
You'll go, "This is what'll happen.
That's why I need them."

176
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:26,405
Hmm... So it's better take them?

177
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:31,043
Yeah, you should take amino acids.
They can't be produced in your body.

178
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:35,247
Okay. You can get them from food, right?

179
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,983
Yeah, getting them from food
is the easiest.

180
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:41,120
Can I still call myself an idol?

181
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:42,054
I'm not sure.

182
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:43,489
What? You're an idol.

183
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:47,059
Idol? Am I still considered an idol?

184
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:50,563
Am I still an idol?

185
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:24,797
{\an8}<i>The one who kept on practicing
the dance performance</i>

186
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,733
{\an8}<i>was the oldest member, Sakamoto.</i>

187
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,340
I may look young on the outside,

188
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:37,476
but what's inside is
definitely 49 years old.

189
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:41,413
-You can't hide it?
-Not anymore.

190
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:46,452
Let's do it with music. Play "TL."

191
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:59,865
<i>The rehearsal for
the dance performance was nearing its end.</i>

192
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,949
It was the most out of sync today.

193
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,551
The most out of sync today?

194
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:32,031
One more time.

195
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,808
Okay, you're now quite in sync.

196
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:46,178
All right. Let's do it one last time.

197
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:03,295
Good. I couldn't take my eyes off of you.

198
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,431
Oh, it's tough today.

199
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:17,943
<i>Sakamoto had a knee surgery two years ago
and hasn't fully recovered yet,</i>

200
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:21,180
<i>but he was engaged in
their 25th-anniversary activities.</i>

201
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:33,559
<i>Since the beginning of the rehearsals...</i>

202
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:34,460
And go...

203
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:36,562
That's it.

204
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:40,332
One, two!

205
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:47,906
-Damn.
-Are you okay?

206
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:49,541
My knee hurts.

207
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:53,178
-Does it hurt?
-Please don't push yourself.

208
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,548
I'm not young anymore!

209
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:01,053
I'm an old man.

210
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:09,094
{\an8}<i>Sakamoto joined the agency when he was 16.</i>

211
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:13,599
{\an8}<i>But he felt anxious about his future,</i>

212
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:16,802
{\an8}<i>and became a corporate employee
before he turned 20.</i>

213
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:20,806
{\an8}<i>But he ran into someone by accident.</i>

214
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:27,679
So I'm commuting to work, and by chance,

215
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:30,916
I run into KinKi Kids on the train,
both of them.

216
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:35,120
They asked me,
"What are you doing now, Sakamoto?"

217
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:36,655
and I couldn't answer.

218
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:43,162
Maybe I felt embarrassed
and frustrated and miserable.

219
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:46,331
-You couldn't say it proudly?
-No, I couldn't. No.

220
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:50,702
Then, whenever I turned on the TV,
everyone was on it.

221
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:57,976
More than feeling frustrated,
I wanted to go back.

222
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:05,451
{\an8}<i>Then, when he was 24,
he debuted as a member of V6.</i>

223
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:11,924
{\an8}<i>He had to lead the younger members,
but there was one thing he wasn't good at.</i>

224
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,028
{\an8}They were cute.

225
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,763
{\an8}Yeah, they were.

226
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,699
{\an8}-I watched them like a parent.
-I know.

227
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:24,703
<i>That was TV-show filming.</i>

228
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:29,942
It's been 25 years, so you may say,
"What are you talking about?"

229
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:35,714
but I still can't get used to TV cameras,
and I get nervous.

230
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:42,221
So like I said, I still get nervous.

231
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,990
But when I'm onstage...

232
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:49,394
I don't get nervous.

233
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:51,630
{\an8}PLAY "OSLO" REHEARSAL

234
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:57,202
{\an8}<i>He has focused mainly on musicals
and has had many experiences.</i>

235
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:58,270
I don't know.

236
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:00,472
Stop pretending and tell me.

237
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:04,209
No, really, I don't even have a clue.
What are you saying...

238
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:10,015
Before I knew it, I was like...
I felt so free and relaxed.

239
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:13,519
I couldn't afford to miss that.

240
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:17,055
And I was heading toward it
without thinking.

241
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:20,259
I don't ever wanna stop doing musicals.

242
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,427
-Ever?
-Yeah.

243
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:23,629
Hey.

244
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:26,431
<i>Every day after work,</i>

245
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:29,935
<i>he goes straight home
to his dog who is waiting for him.</i>

246
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:32,171
I sound lonely, right?

247
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,341
I talk to my dog all the time.

248
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,946
-They listen to you.
-Yeah, they really do.

249
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,848
She goes like "Hm?"

250
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:45,784
So I go, "You know..."

251
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:49,221
{\an8}Hello.

252
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,356
{\an8}Yes.

253
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,325
{\an8}Do I wear the coat for this one?

254
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:59,898
<i>Last year, Inohara teamed up with someone
much younger than him from his agency.</i>

255
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:07,372
<i>In the movie, he played a father
who makes</i> bento <i>lunches every day.</i>

256
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:13,612
<i>His son was played by...</i>

257
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:20,352
{\an8}<i>Shunsuke Michieda
from Naniwa Danshi, 18 years old.</i>

258
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:23,488
{\an8}Hello.

259
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:27,693
Could you two share
bittersweet childhood memories?

260
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,628
Oh, do you have something?

261
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:31,830
What? Yes, I do.

262
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:35,267
When I was in the fifth grade,

263
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:39,404
I got a chance to sit next to my crush.

264
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:41,673
And while I was sitting there...

265
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:46,144
<i>During the filming, they made a rule.</i>

266
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:50,816
When we exchanged contact information,

267
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:55,887
he told me to talk to him like a friend.

268
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:58,590
One day, I messaged him
in honorific language,

269
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:02,494
he took the trouble
to fix it into casual language,

270
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:05,397
and even added a smiling face,

271
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:08,100
and sent it back to me.

272
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:11,203
Then he wrote, "I won't get mad,
so don't worry."

273
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,872
I thought, "Who would say that

274
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:18,010
to someone who's 26 years younger?
He's so awesome."

275
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:23,448
If I get to meet someone younger
from my agency and work together,

276
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:26,618
I want to do the same for them.

277
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:28,287
-Paying it forward.
-Yeah.

278
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:33,191
-Just the two of us first, right?
-Yeah.

279
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:44,536
Mr. Yoshihiko Inohara
and Mr. Shunsuke Michieda!

280
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:47,773
{\an8}<i>The next episode...</i>

281
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:50,409
{\an8}How about wearing
the jacket at some point?

282
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,411
{\an8}Or just do without it.

283
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,613
{\an8}Without changing.

284
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,048
{\an8}-No change?
-No change.

285
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:58,450
{\an8}It'll work if the quality is high.

286
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,987
{\an8}<i>They talk over and over about the show.</i>

287
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:04,890
{\an8}This isn't enough.

288
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:07,993
{\an8}To be blunt, I've seen this before.

289
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:11,129
{\an8}<i>What they have on their mind
will be revealed.</i>
