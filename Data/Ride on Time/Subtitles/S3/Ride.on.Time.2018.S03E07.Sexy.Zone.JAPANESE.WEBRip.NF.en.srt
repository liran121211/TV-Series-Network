00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:04,337
Sexy Zone is here! Thank you for coming!

00:00:04,404 --> 00:00:06,039
SEPTEMBER 10
MAKUHARI MESSE

3
00:00:06,106 --> 00:00:07,741
<i>September 10,</i>

4
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:11,778
{\an8}<i>after one year and nine months,</i>

5
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:15,181
{\an8}<i>Sexy Zone performed with all five members.</i>

6
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:16,649
I can't.

7
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:18,752
-You can.
-I'm nervous.

8
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:22,555
<i>We look backstage. Also...</i>

9
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:26,593
{\an8}There was a time when
there were just three of us.

10
00:00:26,659 --> 00:00:28,561
{\an8}If that hadn't happened,

11
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:31,965
{\an8}I don't think I could be here now.

12
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,034
{\an8}I wouldn't be able to be here now.

13
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:36,603
{\an8}<i>The bonds between the bandmates.</i>

14
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:39,172
{\an8}<i>Their history is about to be revealed.</i>

15
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:04,064
<i>This is documentary series</i> RIDE ON TIME.

16
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:15,375
{\an8}<i>Of all the Johnny's groups</i>

17
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:18,111
{\an8}<i>they debuted at the youngest age,
Sexy Zone.</i>

18
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:19,813
{\an8}<i>This August...</i>

19
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:23,483
Yay!

20
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:24,417
Woo!

21
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:25,685
It's So!

22
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:32,392
{\an8}<i>So Matsushima, who was on medical hiatus,
returned after one year and nine months.</i>

23
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:36,796
<i>Two weeks after that...</i>

24
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:37,831
AUGUST 26

25
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:39,899
<i>Please don't stop</i>

26
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:40,867
<i>Don't stop</i>

27
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,035
Yes.

28
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:46,639
<i>They began rehearsals to prepare
for the five-man show.</i>

29
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,243
-Can I try once more?
-Of course.

30
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:51,611
{\an8}Step forward...

31
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:52,846
{\an8}<i>This was in fact,</i>

32
00:01:52,912 --> 00:01:55,949
{\an8}<i>two hours before the others arrived.</i>

33
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,952
-I want to stop this anxiety.
-I get it.

34
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,054
If I can stop it...

35
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:04,457
Look to the side and put my hand out.

36
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:07,093
{\an8}ONE YEAR AND NINE MONTHS

37
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,895
{\an8}<i>Fighting to catch up.</i>

38
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:10,463
{\an8}<i>Even so...</i>

39
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:14,300
Wait. I still have an hour, right?

40
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:16,102
-Yes.
-Then they'll come.

41
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:20,473
<i>Two hours of extra practice fly by.</i>

42
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,647
This part is important.

43
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:29,048
-Your arm went out.
-Sorry!

44
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:29,949
I put it out.

45
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,785
The last pose starts here. Keep it here.

46
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:33,953
I will. Sorry!

47
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,555
That's not right either.

48
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:36,990
-It's to the side.
-Oops.

49
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:37,957
It's like this.

50
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:41,361
{\an8}-He's here.
-I'm getting excited.

51
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:43,096
{\an8}Take it slow.

52
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:45,131
Yes.

53
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:49,135
-One step at a time.
-Good morning.

54
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:51,371
<i>And then...</i>

55
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:02,282
<i>For the first time in one year
and nine months, the five danced.</i>

56
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:13,993
We haven't danced with So in ages.

57
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:14,894
Yeah.

58
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:15,795
{\an8}Two years?

59
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,130
{\an8}About two years.

60
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:22,602
{\an8}But he can really, you know,
dance well, so I was surprised.

61
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:25,471
I feel like I've learned it a little.

62
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:28,374
I'll go home and practice some more.

63
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:34,681
While I am impressed,
he tends to push himself too hard.

64
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:38,318
So we have to somehow try to set the pace.

65
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:42,789
I believe that's our responsibility.

66
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:44,824
Sexy!

67
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,594
He's teasing me!

68
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,129
Sorry! Bye everyone!

69
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:51,030
Goodbye!

70
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:52,565
<i>As for Matsushima,</i>

71
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:56,469
<i>what was he feeling about
returning to this place?</i>

72
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,638
Uh...

73
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,442
This is my first time
talking about it, but...

74
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:07,113
I had never really, in elementary school,

75
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,083
or in my childhood...

76
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:15,121
I never really had things I liked doing,
or things I wanted to do.

77
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:19,525
Everyone was in soccer clubs and...

78
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,929
the tennis club or something.

79
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:26,799
Everyone was doing what they wanted,
but I didn't have that.

80
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:30,803
I was wondering what my future held

81
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:37,410
and I happened to see
Hey! Say! JUMP's debut concert DVD.

82
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:42,348
I was like, "Wow, who's that?"
And that started it.

83
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:46,252
{\an8}<i>He entered Johnny's at age 13.</i>

84
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,589
{\an8}<i>His debut was about six months later.</i>

85
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:54,327
{\an8}<i>Thinking back,
he says he was missing something.</i>

86
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:58,631
The other four bandmates,

87
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:02,001
they had a certain determination
for doing the job,

88
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:05,438
but I didn't have that determination yet.

89
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:11,277
Especially Fuma and Kento, they'd been
in Johnny's Jr. for a long time,

90
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:13,413
so they were determined to debut.

91
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,549
And they had goals for after that.

92
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:19,118
They were prepared for how it would be.

93
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:20,586
But in my case,

94
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:23,323
I wanted to join Johnny's
and change my life.

95
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:25,825
I just fearlessly jumped in

96
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:27,560
and I suddenly debuted.

97
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:31,431
I didn't have time to prepare, mentally.

98
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:35,902
And I didn't even know what work was.

99
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:42,175
A lot of things happened
and I just couldn't keep up.

100
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:46,446
<i>We asked the others about Matsushima.</i>

101
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:50,083
With him, with all things,

102
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:55,588
we wanted him to experience them
in a positive way.

103
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:58,624
We always thought about that.

104
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:04,263
No matter what So decided to do,

105
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:08,434
I told him I'd support him.

106
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:14,474
I also told him that
the love I feel for So hasn't changed.

107
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,978
<i>They each kept a certain distance
in their own ways.</i>

108
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:27,653
I had a feeling this song would
get So to come back.

109
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:30,456
And with this song,

110
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:34,527
we'd make a comfortable place
for So to return to.

111
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:37,697
{\an8}It's a can of juice for Matsushima.

112
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:42,101
{\an8}Matsushima's here
and we're all taking a break together.

113
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:44,737
{\an8}We wanted to make that sort of atmosphere.

114
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:48,374
It's not the answer, but
that's how I see it, anyway.

115
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,443
To keep the pressure off me,

116
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:54,414
they tried to keep a good balance
and I could see that.

117
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:58,484
That sort of thing made me really happy.

118
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:06,526
It helped me realize,
"I do want to work with those four."

119
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:09,395
I spoke to the people at the agency

120
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:15,368
and I said, "Let me start talking
to the bandmates again."

121
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:19,772
So I'm grateful to Mr. Johnny

122
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,608
and I'm grateful to my bandmates.

123
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:25,378
And to all the fans
who kept supporting me,

124
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,847
of course, I feel gratitude toward them.

125
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:32,485
That's why I wanted to
give this another try.

126
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:37,390
<i>September 10, Makuhari Messe.</i>

127
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:41,627
Today's our first time with five.

128
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:43,796
I'll do my best.

129
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,235
<i>The day finally came.</i>

130
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,737
FIRST PERFORMANCE WITH 5 MEMBERS

131
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,673
Two, three, four.

132
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:57,844
<i>Before the show, they made final
adjustments in a corner of the venue.</i>

133
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,448
Are you okay, So?

134
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:03,749
I'll practice alone.

135
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:04,684
Practice alone?

136
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,118
-Want to go again?
-No.

137
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,020
You're okay?

138
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:11,424
We don't need to do it together.
I can do it alone.

139
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:16,262
<i>However...</i>

140
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:21,167
Don't overthink.

141
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:22,602
-Yes.
-Do it with us.

142
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,637
-Okay.
-If we're here, you'll get it.

143
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:27,840
<i>The others came back right away.</i>

144
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:32,945
<i>He was concerned about this sequence.</i>

145
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:34,947
...Look!

146
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,383
Don't push so hard.

147
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:41,888
You're like, "I gotta do this!"
That's why it looks weird.

148
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,223
Okay. I'll try to relax.

149
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:47,193
I'll do it one more time. I'm worried.

150
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:53,399
Look!

151
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:01,574
Don't think about doing that.

152
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:03,609
You all look nice doing this.

153
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:05,344
Don't do it with the sound.

154
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:07,713
Hear the sound and then do it.

155
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:11,284
...Like that?

156
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:14,253
Not quite. It's not that kind of song.

157
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,755
Yeah, but that's it.

158
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:16,789
I can't.

159
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:18,591
-You can.
-I'm nervous.

160
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:23,195
<i>Before the performance.</i>

161
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,532
We're going to give this to Sakurai.

162
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:30,069
<i>In fact, the day before...</i>

163
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:33,906
Welcome to <i>Sekai Kindan no Hakobiya</i>.

164
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:37,143
<i>Kikuchi finished his first
prime-time show as host.</i>

165
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:41,013
<i>Afterward, he spoke about
his senior, Sakurai.</i>

166
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,584
Tomorrow, we're on <i>The Music Day</i>.

167
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,118
We'll be, you know...

168
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:51,090
We'll have the honor
of recording a segment.

169
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:56,896
Sho Sakurai is the MC

170
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,632
and he said that tomorrow...

171
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:02,268
he's going to come see us.

172
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:06,205
He told me that himself.

173
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,841
{\an8}Originally, it was just the five of us

174
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:11,110
{\an8}going there to record it alone.

175
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:15,848
{\an8}And then that would be used
during the live broadcast.

176
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:20,686
But he said, "Since it's all five of you,

177
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:26,225
it's important for me to be there."

178
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:29,261
It was...

179
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,099
It was really moving.

180
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,539
-Hi.
-Good to see you.

181
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:41,974
Thank you for today.

182
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:43,809
Thank you for coming.

183
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:47,480
This is the second one.
The one from the other day was A.

184
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:49,682
-So this is B?
-It's the regular one.

185
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:50,983
It's not B?

186
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:51,884
There's a reason.

187
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:54,086
-This has all English lyrics.
-Really?

188
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:58,891
Since you're working with Bruno Mars,
we also wanted to show you what we can do.

189
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,927
I see. Sorry, I didn't realize.

190
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:04,296
Thanks. You even signed it.

191
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:07,233
Thank you very much.

192
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:08,501
I can't wait.

193
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:09,902
Thank you very much.

194
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:11,737
Thank you for your time.

195
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:13,572
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

196
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:15,141
Excuse us.

197
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:16,809
-Why the smirk?
-Hits the spot!

198
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:17,710
Don't lie.

199
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:19,645
Thank you. Goodbye.

200
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:20,713
Sexy thank you!

201
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,647
Thank you sexy too!

202
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,118
{\an8}<i>Then, the shoot.</i>

203
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,586
{\an8}-Hey, So.
-Yes!

204
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:28,487
{\an8}Welcome back.

205
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:30,156
{\an8}Thanks! Sorry for the wait.

206
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:31,891
How are you feeling?

207
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:35,761
I'm very happy to be
able to perform as five.

208
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:39,598
And these four gave me
such a warm welcome. I'm really happy.

209
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:43,202
Seeing the five of you together
makes me happy too.

210
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:45,037
Everyone, places please.

211
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:47,039
Thank you!

212
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:09,328
<i>Here's that part of the performance.</i>

213
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,476
<i>This is how Sexy Zone</i>

214
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:26,946
<i>launched their new beginning
in the best possible way.</i>

215
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,518
Thank you very much!

216
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:33,753
That was great.

217
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:38,924
Wow, I was so nervous.

218
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:44,430
Performing with all five of us,
I feel, is really great.

219
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:47,700
With So there,

220
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,238
the atmosphere is warmer,
our laughs are friendlier.

221
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:57,576
He's like the connector between bandmates.

222
00:12:57,643 --> 00:13:01,080
It's part of So's character.

223
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:04,383
That's how he does it.

224
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:08,254
Appearing as a five-man group

225
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:12,858
makes a difference
when he's with us. We're stronger.

226
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:14,493
{\an8}5 MEMBERS

227
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,897
{\an8}<i>The insistence on having five members.</i>

228
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:22,501
{\an8}<i>This is a part of Sexy Zone's history.</i>

229
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:29,642
There was a time when
there were just three of us.

230
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,777
We've been through a lot.

231
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,381
But the fact that we are five,

232
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:40,186
that was one core element for me.

233
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:46,225
{\an8}<i>From 2014, Sexy Zone did in fact</i>

234
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:51,363
{\an8}<i>operate as a three-man group
with Sato, Nakajima, and Kikuchi.</i>

235
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:54,200
{\an8}<i>Marius and Matsushima</i>

236
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:57,436
{\an8}<i>each had formed their own subunits.</i>

237
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:58,404
{\an8}MARIUS YO
SEXY BOYZ

238
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,371
{\an8}SO MATSUSHIMA
SEXY SHO

239
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:01,907
The fans really got the wrong impression.

240
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:08,781
They kept saying, "Marius and So
were kicked out of Sexy Zone."

241
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:13,953
It's true that it looked that way,

242
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,888
but I thought of it positively.

243
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:19,792
"Now's my chance to improve myself."

244
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,493
That's how I felt.

245
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,964
I am glad we went back to
five members now though.

246
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:29,034
Back then, it was simply a matter of age.

247
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:32,605
I didn't understand how anything worked.

248
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:36,609
"Why am I working apart from those three?"

249
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:39,178
That was all I thought about.

250
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:43,883
But now I don't feel negatively about it.

251
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:45,784
I don't think it's bad at all.

252
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:49,555
That's not just for the camera.
I really don't feel that way.

253
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:52,491
In fact, if that hadn't happened,

254
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,895
I don't think I could be here now.

255
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:58,097
I wouldn't be able to be here now.

256
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:00,232
I think Mr. Johnny knew...

257
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:04,069
that I was missing something.

258
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:10,109
He had me form a side unit like that
in order to find it.

259
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:12,945
I think he gave me the time to do that.

260
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:16,181
If I hadn't had that time,
I wouldn't have grown.

261
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:19,852
I needed to grow
as a person and as an artist,

262
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,622
so that unit, Sexy Sho,
was totally necessary.

263
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:30,462
{\an8}<i>Their positive outlook on past experiences
helped bring the bandmates closer.</i>

264
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:33,966
<i>Late August.</i>

265
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:38,137
<i>They began learning new choreography.</i>

266
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:48,747
<i>It's the theme song for a drama
starring Fuma Kikuchi.</i>

267
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:50,449
"NOT FOUND."

268
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:55,988
Three and four.

269
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:57,089
AUGUST 26

270
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:58,324
Three and four.

271
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,659
<i>This was the first day.</i>

272
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,034
I got it.

273
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:13,672
This song has a lot of choreography.

274
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:16,475
I'm really using my brain.

275
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:22,514
I just have to get used to it.
Repeat it until I remember.

276
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,592
<i>They continue rehearsing.</i>

277
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:39,131
<i>Meanwhile, where was Fuma Kikuchi?</i>

278
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:44,269
Rolling. Ready, go!

279
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:47,306
{\an8}Follow the path you believe in.

280
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:48,407
{\an8}Every day,

281
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:51,443
{\an8}<i>he was busy filming
as the lead in that drama.</i>

282
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,446
Yes, okay. Cut, okay.

283
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,347
<i>Because of this...</i>

284
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,953
<i>rehearsals were done
with the remaining four.</i>

285
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:11,397
{\an8}<i>Then, the time came
to shoot the music video.</i>

286
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,641
Okay, I think we're done.

287
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,343
-Good work.
-Thank you.

288
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,178
-Was that the lip-sync?
-Yes.

289
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:28,647
This next one is the hardest part.

290
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,083
From start to finish,

291
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:34,853
we dance the whole time,
for nearly four minutes.

292
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:38,223
Yeah, so if you make one mistake,

293
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,259
you have to start over.

294
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:42,661
I can't make any mistakes.

295
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:44,863
I'm really nervous.

296
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,331
Is that right?

297
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:51,537
I do get nervous.
What if I make a mistake?

298
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:54,473
{\an8}<i>Then, it began.</i>

299
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,642
{\an8}<i>The shoot they can't mess up.</i>

300
00:17:57,142 --> 00:17:58,811
<i>The one who made a mistake was...</i>

301
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:14,259
Okay, let's restart now.

302
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:18,263
<i>Take two.</i>

303
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:27,473
<i>This time, they made it to
the final section without a mistake.</i>

304
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:31,343
<i>But then...</i>

305
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:42,454
I'm so frustrated!

306
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:46,391
Is your hand alright?

307
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,227
-Can we do it again?
-Okay!

308
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:08,013
<i>Kikuchi got stuck in a rut.</i>

309
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:10,482
<i>Then...</i>

310
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,818
Let's take a break!

311
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:16,121
I need to rehearse.

312
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,035
<i>And then...</i>

313
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:53,592
-Okay!
-Yay!

314
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:54,893
Hey!

315
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,097
I'm so sorry about that. Thank you.

316
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:00,299
Good job.

317
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,700
Yay!

318
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:05,537
<i>Then on October 27...</i>

319
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:09,174

"I'm so nervous."
That went on air, didn't it?

332
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:36,635
It did.

333
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:38,670
Please keep an eye on the clock.

334
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,072

00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:36,161
{\an8}<i>Next time, they go
where their fans await them.</i>

352
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:38,330
{\an8}We can finally do it.

353
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:40,932
{\an8}It's all love. Nothing but love.

354
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:43,335
{\an8}So's on here.

355
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:45,037
{\an8}We're the only ones with this.

356
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:49,141
{\an8}<i>With Matsushima's return,
Sexy Zone was whole again.</i>

357
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:50,776
{\an8}<i>They went with all their strength.</i>

358
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:53,445
{\an8}<i>An online concert with
no audience present.</i>

359
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:58,083
{\an8}They're doing something they've never
done before on the center stage.

360
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:04,890
{\an8}I like this group.

361
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:08,060
{\an8}I like this group and everyone in it.

362
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:11,430
{\an8}So that's it, I guess.

363
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,867
{\an8}<i>They searched for their own answers.</i>
