<i>I was told I had no sense of rhythm.</i>

00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:16,883
{\an8}My little sister started
taking dance lessons,

3
00:00:17,884 --> 00:00:22,522
{\an8}and I was taken along
to the dance studio to try it out as well.

4
00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:24,724
<i>That's where it started.</i>

5
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:28,028

"SENNEN MEDLEY"

7
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:07,200
I really love when I'm dancing

8
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:10,804
without thinking about anything else,

9
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:16,276
and there are times that listening
to a song makes me want to dance.

10
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:18,344
So I love it,

11
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:22,549
<i>but when I have to think about
how to present it,</i>

12
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:25,852
<i>I don't exactly hate it,</i>

13
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:30,990
<i>but I do think it's difficult.</i>

14
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:34,227
<i>However, once I get past that...</i>

15
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:40,467
I feel that I'm able to continue
doing this work

16
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:45,939
<i>because I like receiving the praise
and applause from the fans.</i>

17
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:49,809
I'd say that it drives me

18
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,547
to aim higher even now.

19
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:56,583
Yeah.

Torajya Ninjapan.

23
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:39,792
{\an8}Make sure you share this
with anyone who needs it.

24
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:41,594
-Master!
-What is it, Master?

25
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:44,230
-She gave me the best salt.
-Salt?

26
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:45,732
It really recharges you.

27
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:47,600
-For real?
-It's crazy.

28
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,769
{\an8}Try it if you ever twist an ankle.

29
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,472

I really don't get nervous.

36
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:18,765
That's impressive.

37
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:21,034
-I'm not nervous.
-What are you then?

38
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,570
I just feel energized.

-I see.

41
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:33,179
{\an8}Yara mentioned it before,
but we shouldn't try so hard.

42
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:35,048
That really is the case.

43
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:42,789
We should stay composed
to keep our performance relaxed.

44
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,526
Then the audience can relax too.

45
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,695
Right.

46
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,030
This is tough.

47
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:52,365
It is.

48
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:54,667
The third floor is such a pain.

49
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:59,806
I might get more tired from this
than the trampoline.

No. It's bad.

54
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,291
Huh?

55
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,594
I'm worried about my legs.

56
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:23,363
Your legs?

00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,198
-You might get a cramp?
-Yeah.

Okay!

00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:47,373
<i>The play's first act

77
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,910
<i>while the second act is centered
around the dance numbers.</i>

78
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:52,879
<i>The first act</i>

79
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:58,985
<i>is about an hour of
non-stop acrobatics and action.</i>

80
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:03,222
<i>It is a performance
that pushes them to the limit.</i>

81
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:42,195
My sons, you must never raise
your hand against the meek.

82
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:43,963

83
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,199
Yes, Father!

85
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:54,373
<i>This will likely become a familiar sight

00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:02,615
Father, we will use these powers
to become the legendary Torajya!

88
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:08,020
We will all get through any hardships
together as you wish, Father.

89
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:09,722
My sons...

90
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:15,194
<i>Yet they will stand on the stage again</i>

91
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:18,431
<i>and give it everything they have.</i>

92
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:28,508

Genta's open!

96
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:42,722
Damn it!

97
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:46,526
-Kaito!
-Hey!

98
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:51,597
Corner kick.

99
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:07,847
Doing this is nice too.

100
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:12,585
You guys went all out.

101
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:15,688
I'm beat.

102
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:21,460
You can't help it.
You just start playing get caught up.

103
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,071
Damn!

104
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,240
They underestimated us!

105
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:38,210
This is fun.

106
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:43,015
{\an8}I spend more time with them
than I do with family.

107
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,985
{\an8}We're together when we work,

108
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,889
but it's not a problem spending
days off together either.

109
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:55,461
Time we spend in private
does affect our relationship on the job.

110
00:09:55,528 --> 00:10:02,034
Enjoyment is built
during your time off work.

111
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,937
You only live once.

112
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:08,708
You never know when you'll lose this time.

113
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:13,779
You have to enjoy each day
with every fiber of your being.

114
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:15,548
I know it's cheesy.

115
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:19,285
Although, I think the obvious
is really important.

116
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:23,623
The more I blur between
my public and private life,

117
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:25,324
the longer I can be myself.

118
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:27,159
You know?

00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,396

123
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:58,684
Everyone cramped up.

124
00:11:58,751 --> 00:11:59,919
-Cramped up?
-Yeah.

125
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:01,954
Shime and Kaito Nakamura.

126
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:06,325

<i>In consideration of their condition,</i>

136
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:52,805
<i>they hastily cut out
a number of sequences.</i>

137
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:55,641
Does everyone know this?

138
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,177
-Yes.
-Yes.

139
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:00,713
Are you okay with jumping?

140
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,014
I'm not sure.

141
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:03,749
We're a team. It's okay.

142
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:08,754
{\an8}<i>However, the next song "Volcano"</i>

143
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:13,225
{\an8}<i>is an intense dance number with
a big moment when they jump in unison.</i>

144
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:26,639
<i>They cannot cut out this jump sequence.</i>

145
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:31,410
<i>The decisive moment comes
as they stand on stage.</i>

146
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:09,415
-Bath time.
-Yes.

147
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:11,016
Go take a bath.

148
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,484
AFTER THE SHOW

149
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:14,920
-Sorry.
-Oh, whoa!

150
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:17,823
TOMOYUKI YARA

151
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,593
{\an8}You're allowed
to laugh in situations like this.

152
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:21,927
Sorry.

153
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:23,896
-How did you do it?
-Trampoline.

154
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:26,432
Right, the trampoline. That rascal, huh?

155
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:28,234
-Yeah, that's the one.
-Yeah.

156
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:33,272
-Your robot was really good though.
-That's true.

157
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:39,311
Man, I look so ridiculous.

158
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,546
Ow.

159
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:45,451
It hurts.

160
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:51,357
It was fun though.

161
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:52,958
-Really?
-Yeah.

162
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:59,632
I hope this helps people
get through another day.

163
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:05,905
Even with their masks on,

164
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:10,342
you could still tell
how happy everyone was.

165
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,317
It really made me aware of
how grateful I am to the others.

166
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:20,386
Please come in.

167
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:22,955
Just don't show my lower half.

168
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,159
I had no idea this was here.

169
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,166
I always come here alone.

170
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:35,834
I see.

171
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:37,069
Wait...

172
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:40,306
Whatever, it's just us guys here.

173
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:48,614
You know...

174
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:51,951
it was just so frustrating.

175
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,090
But I mean,

176
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:03,262
they could have said
I didn't need to go out.

177
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:08,600
However, the guys suggested
changing things or skipping certain parts

178
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:12,404
to compensate and highlight
our other strengths.

179
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:16,709
It's really nice how they helped me.

180
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:21,647
It really made me feel like
I'm not alone with this group.

181
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:26,051
It made me want to work even harder.

182
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:50,709
<i>It was fun, and it felt good.</i>

183
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:58,217
I could really tell
how happy the fans were.

184
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:04,923
<i>This was only made possible...</i>

185
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,695
<i>because of the efforts everyone put in.</i>

186
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,935
Every little thing does help.

187
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:35,220
<i>Getting to see an audience for the first
time in a while,</i>

188
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:38,624
I actually cried during "Together Now."

189
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,326
I was just overwhelmed with happiness.

190
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,993
You know...

191
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:18,263
I've probably flipped around
30 to 50 times.

192
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,467
<i>I can feel it taking its toll,</i>

193
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:25,370
<i>but it's not like I can say
that I can't move anymore.</i>

194
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,840
I can't be crying about it.

195
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:31,977
I almost need to be the one
pushing everyone else.

196
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:38,016
It may add pressure on me,
but I personally find it fun.

197
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:41,820
I'm not alone after all.

198
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:48,093
There are the other members,
so I do it for them and for myself.

199
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,859
-Great work out there.
-Thanks.

200
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:57,062
It feels like the closing day.

201
00:19:58,597 --> 00:19:59,631
Right?

202
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:03,101
During "Together Now"...

203
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:04,002
Yes?

204
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:06,371
You were crying, weren't you?

205
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,007
You caught me.

206
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:12,411
Yeah, but you know...

207
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:17,049
I don't know.

208
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:19,918
Whenever I accomplish something,

209
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:26,325
I want to enter that state of mind.

210
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:31,230
Being able to see the people
you haven't been able to...

211
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:38,870
there's something
that really builds up inside.

212
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:42,908
I'll need to give it my all

213
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:46,245
until the 27th.

214
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:48,547
You think you can?

215
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:49,481
Well...

216
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:52,184
I have the guys.

217
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:55,921
<i>I'm not in this alone.</i>

218
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,758
<i>Between the seven of us,</i>

219
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:06,498
<i>we can equally split our responsibilities,
so I feel there's less of a burden.</i>

220
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:10,402
{\an8}I feel like I can give it my all.

221
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:17,442
{\an8}<i>Until the day they take the stage again,</i>

222
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:20,112
{\an8}<i>they have each other.</i>

223
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:25,884
{\an8}<i>That alone is what makes
their ability for expression limitless.</i>

224
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:36,295
<i>The next</i> RIDE ON TIME
<i>is a special edition.</i>

225
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:41,366
{\an8}<i>Sexy Zone celebrated
their tenth anniversary this year.</i>

226
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:47,372
{\an8}Sexy Zone is a group that can turn
a crisis into an opportunity.

227
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:50,676
Each one of us wanted to find
a new side to ourselves

228
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:52,244
that we haven't seen before.

229
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:55,947
{\an8}<i>An obstacle they must overcome.</i>

230
00:21:57,382 --> 00:22:00,285
We are in a rough shape...

231
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:03,388
This is where the hard work begins.

232
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:05,457
Rather than ten years of nothing,

233
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:08,393
we have so much to talk about
from the past ten years.

234
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,263
I think that's a wonderful thing.

235
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,598
<i>An anniversary
that brings people together.</i>

236
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:16,401
Sexy Zone!

237
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:17,903
