1
00:00:01,655 --> 00:00:04,556
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:04,658 --> 00:00:06,649
<i>and the one son who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,751
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:14,201 --> 00:00:15,930
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

5
00:00:20,507 --> 00:00:23,408
<i>Michael Bluth and
his family had gathered at the courthouse...</i>

6
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:27,344
<i>to discuss George Sr.'s upcoming trial.</i>

7
00:00:27,447 --> 00:00:29,574
Do not ask me how I did it...

8
00:00:29,683 --> 00:00:32,083
they offered us a plea bargain.

9
00:00:32,185 --> 00:00:34,915
Really? There's a chance
we don't have to go to trial?

10
00:00:35,022 --> 00:00:36,683
Absolutely, and I say we take it...

11
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:38,758
because we will never
get an offer this good again.

12
00:00:38,859 --> 00:00:41,760
- Wow.
- Great. What's the offer?

13
00:00:41,862 --> 00:00:45,423
Well, I didn't read it. I just got it yesterday.

14
00:00:45,532 --> 00:00:48,228
F.Y.I., I'm trying to get back
into the dating world.

15
00:00:52,706 --> 00:00:56,472
Hey, you're not one of those silly men
that's dressed like a woman, are you?

16
00:00:56,577 --> 00:00:58,841
No, baby. I'm the real thing.

17
00:01:00,814 --> 00:01:03,647
I don't understand how a person
can put their sex life in front of their work.

18
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,186
He's a man, Michael. He needs a woman.

19
00:01:07,287 --> 00:01:09,949
Can we get back to work, folks?

20
00:01:10,057 --> 00:01:12,025
We've only got 24 hours to respond...

21
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:14,992
and no matter what this is,
it is better than going to trial.

22
00:01:15,095 --> 00:01:18,121
<i>Your father's not here. I'll speak for him.</i>

23
00:01:18,231 --> 00:01:20,426
He loves it. He's crazy about the plea.

24
00:01:20,534 --> 00:01:23,697
<i>He's dying to get out of that prison
and be with a woman again.</i>

25
00:01:23,804 --> 00:01:25,829
<i>In fact, George Sr. had a woman in his life...</i>

26
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:29,340
<i>Cindi Lightballoon,
a fan ofhis Caged Wisdom video series...</i>

27
00:01:29,443 --> 00:01:32,071
<i>with whom he'd had fleeting physical contact.</i>

28
00:01:32,179 --> 00:01:35,342
<i>That morning however,
she had some startling news for him.</i>

29
00:01:35,449 --> 00:01:37,508
I'm a mole.

30
00:01:37,618 --> 00:01:41,179
Well, you know,
God doesn't care how big your teeth are.

31
00:01:41,288 --> 00:01:43,449
Yes, you could go to a dentist.
You could... Whoo.

32
00:01:43,557 --> 00:01:48,517
You could grind off about... I don't know...
30%, maybe more. Yeah, I wouldn't miss it.

33
00:01:48,629 --> 00:01:51,996
No, no, no.
I mean, I'm an undercover government agent.

34
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:54,567
I was sent here to investigate you.

35
00:01:54,668 --> 00:01:58,365
Up until last week,
my being in love with you was just an act.

36
00:01:58,472 --> 00:02:01,339
- Hmm.
- But now I want to be with you.

37
00:02:01,441 --> 00:02:04,433
And I know you can beat this case
they have against you.

38
00:02:04,544 --> 00:02:06,273
I know this for a fact.

39
00:02:08,015 --> 00:02:11,542
I want to fight this thing.
I can beat it. I know it for a fact.

40
00:02:11,652 --> 00:02:13,620
- We're taking the plea.
- Lucille, we're not taking a plea.

41
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,620
We don't even know what the plea is yet.

42
00:02:15,722 --> 00:02:18,054
Is that a shot at me?
'Cause that makes me want to read it less.

43
00:02:18,158 --> 00:02:19,989
<i>- You have another one of these?
- Yes, I do.</i>

44
00:02:20,093 --> 00:02:22,288
<i>- We'll both read it.
- You're going to read that?</i>

45
00:02:22,396 --> 00:02:23,727
<i>- Yeah.
- It's pretty thick.</i>

46
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,560
He thinks he's a lawyer
'cause he played one in 10th grade.

47
00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:28,999
<i>In order to satisfy an English requirement...</i>

48
00:02:29,102 --> 00:02:31,002
<i>Michael appeared
in the drama club's production...</i>

49
00:02:31,104 --> 00:02:33,368
<i>of an original play,
The Trial of Captain Hook.</i>

50
00:02:40,881 --> 00:02:44,180
- I don't remember that.
- Well, you left during my solo.

51
00:02:44,284 --> 00:02:46,184
And I'm surprised my twin sister
can remember that...

52
00:02:46,286 --> 00:02:49,119
considering she was repeating
the ninth grade at the time.

53
00:02:49,222 --> 00:02:52,123
<i>- I don't remember that.
- Big surprise, Mom.</i>

54
00:02:52,225 --> 00:02:54,125
It's not like you ever took an interest
in our lives.

55
00:02:54,227 --> 00:02:56,889
Honestly, if I ever did to Maeby what you-

56
00:02:56,997 --> 00:02:59,124
<i>Lindsay recalled that earlier that day...</i>

57
00:02:59,232 --> 00:03:02,258
<i>she had received a letter from the high school
about her own daughter.</i>

58
00:03:05,572 --> 00:03:10,737
<i>And so later, Lindsay and Tobias tried
a more hands-on approach to parenting.</i>

59
00:03:10,844 --> 00:03:13,312
We would like you to tutor our daughter.

60
00:03:13,413 --> 00:03:16,576
Now, of course,
we're having a bit of a cash-flow problem...

61
00:03:16,683 --> 00:03:18,583
but I assure you...

62
00:03:18,685 --> 00:03:20,585
if you bring our little girl's grades up...

63
00:03:20,687 --> 00:03:24,248
I will pack your sweet pink mouth
with so much ice cream...

64
00:03:24,357 --> 00:03:26,951
you'll be the envy
of everyJerry and Jane on the block.

65
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,460
We're the only house on the block.

66
00:03:32,365 --> 00:03:34,663
Perhaps we should get somebody else.

67
00:03:34,768 --> 00:03:37,601
<i>Michael, meanwhile, had gone to the bar
across the street from the courthouse...</i>

68
00:03:37,704 --> 00:03:39,797
<i>to read the plea offer.</i>

69
00:03:39,906 --> 00:03:42,238
"Not to exceed five years, but no less than three."

70
00:03:42,342 --> 00:03:44,071
- So what do you think?
- I don't know.

71
00:03:44,177 --> 00:03:47,442
I'm so mad at Barry I can't even focus.
That guy's out dating?

72
00:03:47,547 --> 00:03:50,311
- I mean, I'd love to be dating, but l...
- Can't relax?

73
00:03:50,417 --> 00:03:53,784
No. I don't have time for a relationship.
This is important.

74
00:03:53,887 --> 00:03:56,151
No one said anything about a relationship,
Michael.

75
00:03:56,256 --> 00:03:58,156
If you'd slept with more than four women,
you'd know that.

76
00:03:58,258 --> 00:04:01,318
- I have, Gob.
- More than five?

77
00:04:02,929 --> 00:04:06,660
Let's say "five".
This is a courthouse bar, Michael.

78
00:04:06,767 --> 00:04:08,735
These are professional, aggressive women...

79
00:04:08,835 --> 00:04:11,429
who are looking for nothing more
than a one-night stand.

80
00:04:11,538 --> 00:04:15,235
No real names, no promises.

81
00:04:15,342 --> 00:04:18,505
I'm not a one-night stand kind of guy.
I don't like lying to women.

82
00:04:18,612 --> 00:04:21,274
These are lawyers...
that's Latin for "liar."

83
00:04:21,381 --> 00:04:23,315
I can't believe
I'm still reading the same sentence.

84
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:25,941
How can something be
"no less than three" if it exceeds six?

85
00:04:26,052 --> 00:04:27,952
I mean, six is still more than three, right?

86
00:04:28,054 --> 00:04:30,614
Yeah, and it's still more than five.

87
00:04:32,025 --> 00:04:35,654
- Oh! Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

88
00:04:35,762 --> 00:04:37,662
- I'm falling all over you.
- Let me move down.

89
00:04:37,764 --> 00:04:39,755
I'm just working on this plea.

90
00:04:39,866 --> 00:04:44,200
If you're pleading with me
to have a drink with you, you can stop begging.

91
00:04:44,304 --> 00:04:46,898
No, no. It's a...

92
00:04:47,007 --> 00:04:50,033
It's a plea for this case that I'm...
I'm sorry... you want a drink.

93
00:04:50,143 --> 00:04:53,340
Well, I didn't come here for the view.

94
00:04:53,446 --> 00:04:56,472
- I'll have a vodka martini.
- I'll tell him.

95
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:59,347
- So, another lawyer, huh?
- Vodka martini!

96
00:04:59,452 --> 00:05:02,717
I'm Maggie Lizer,
as in "Maggie lies her ass off."

97
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,223
One person laughed at that once,
and I don't know why I keep trying it.

98
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:13,265
- No, it's good. Yeah.
- What kind of law do you practice?

99
00:05:17,137 --> 00:05:20,573
Maritime. Maritime law.
Lawyers of the sea.

100
00:05:20,674 --> 00:05:23,074
Oh. Submarine chaser.

101
00:05:23,176 --> 00:05:25,371
What's your name?

102
00:05:25,478 --> 00:05:27,446
- Chareth.
- Chareth.

103
00:05:27,547 --> 00:05:29,412
Oh. So then what's your last name?

104
00:05:29,516 --> 00:05:31,984
- Cute story...
- Cutestory?

105
00:05:33,486 --> 00:05:35,545
Yes. Chareth Cutestory.

106
00:05:35,655 --> 00:05:39,091
- That's an interesting name.
- Is it?

107
00:05:39,192 --> 00:05:42,252
So here's the test that I failed.

108
00:05:42,362 --> 00:05:44,956
Oh, okay.
Yeah, I see the problem right away.

109
00:05:45,065 --> 00:05:46,965
You, uh...
You got all the answers wrong.

110
00:05:47,067 --> 00:05:50,867
You know you, you even got your name
wrong here. It says, "S. Fünke."

111
00:05:50,971 --> 00:05:53,064
Yeah, well, see, what they want you to do...

112
00:05:53,173 --> 00:05:55,164
is put an "S" if you're single,
an "M" if you're married.

113
00:05:55,275 --> 00:05:58,938
I mean, most of us are all single,
but it's a whole government thing, so...

114
00:05:59,045 --> 00:06:02,071
Yeah. Okay. The first thing you want to do
when you're dealing with fractions...

115
00:06:02,182 --> 00:06:03,450
<i>Yeah. So I'm gonna go, okay?</i>

116
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:04,348
<i>Yeah. So I'm gonna go, okay?</i>

117
00:06:04,451 --> 00:06:08,512
So just fill in all the right answers here,
and I'll see where I went wrong.

118
00:06:08,622 --> 00:06:10,522
And you're getting paid for this right?

119
00:06:10,624 --> 00:06:13,491
There was talk of ice cream,
but not exactly on my terms.

120
00:06:13,593 --> 00:06:16,357
Wow! Where did you get all that?
Do you have a job or something?

121
00:06:16,463 --> 00:06:19,455
No, but you do.

122
00:06:19,566 --> 00:06:21,796
Now, look. Don't feel guilty.

123
00:06:21,902 --> 00:06:24,336
I don't really need tutoring anyways, okay?

124
00:06:24,437 --> 00:06:27,497
- Enjoy the 200 bucks.
- Oh, there... there's six 20s here.

125
00:06:27,607 --> 00:06:31,134
- That's right.
- Right.

126
00:06:31,244 --> 00:06:34,179
<i>After an evening of drinking,
Michael, being the sensible one...</i>

127
00:06:34,281 --> 00:06:36,181
<i>offered to give Maggie a ride home.</i>

128
00:06:36,283 --> 00:06:39,343
Oh-ho!

129
00:06:44,391 --> 00:06:46,291
<i>The next morning, Michael was wondering...</i>

130
00:06:46,393 --> 00:06:48,793
<i>how to end his first one-night stand.</i>

131
00:06:50,897 --> 00:06:53,491
<i>- Coffee?
- Hi. Yes, please. Thank you. That's great.</i>

132
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,628
But you know what? I am going to have to
read that plea soon, okay? 'Cause it's a big case.

133
00:06:58,738 --> 00:07:00,797
But I promise later I will call...

134
00:07:00,907 --> 00:07:04,172
<i>Michael struggled to follow Gob's
instruction tojust walk away.</i>

135
00:07:04,277 --> 00:07:07,178
I'll... I'll... I'll call, okay?
All right?

136
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,805
- Hey. Who's this?
- Oh, that's Justice.

137
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:14,285
- Hi, Justice.
- Hi, Justice. Is he as handsome as he smells?

138
00:07:14,387 --> 00:07:16,787
I didn't... I didn't know that you had a dog.

139
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:20,485
- How else am I gonna get to work?
- You ride a dog to work?

140
00:07:20,593 --> 00:07:24,723
You are funny. Let me see that smile.

141
00:07:24,831 --> 00:07:28,528
Well, it's tough with your hands in the way.

142
00:07:28,635 --> 00:07:31,035
- Say when.
- Okay.

143
00:07:33,873 --> 00:07:37,502
<i>And suddenly, Michael recalled
some non sequiturs from the night before.</i>

144
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,840
So, tell me something personal
about yourself.

145
00:07:39,946 --> 00:07:44,178
Uh, well, I have an irreversible case
of ocular retinoblastoma.

146
00:07:44,284 --> 00:07:46,411
Hey. I thought we said no more law talk.

147
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:48,510
I really can't see anybody right now.

148
00:07:48,621 --> 00:07:51,215
Oh, well, I can't see anybody ever.

149
00:07:51,324 --> 00:07:55,226
- I'm blind.
- I'm wasted.

150
00:07:55,328 --> 00:07:59,856
<i>Michael realized that the woman
he was attempting to never see again was blind...</i>

151
00:07:59,966 --> 00:08:02,093
<i>and he was overcome with guilt.</i>

152
00:08:02,202 --> 00:08:04,762
- When... can we go out again?
- Really?

153
00:08:04,871 --> 00:08:07,999
I thought you were, like,
just into this one-night stand kind of thing.

154
00:08:08,108 --> 00:08:11,600
Come on. I took a blind woman
home with no intention of dating her again?

155
00:08:11,711 --> 00:08:13,736
Please!

156
00:08:18,051 --> 00:08:21,953
<i>George Sr. was continuing
to exploit his relationship with Cindi.</i>

157
00:08:22,055 --> 00:08:25,456
What... What evidence
does the government have...

158
00:08:25,558 --> 00:08:27,856
on old wise George, by the way?

159
00:08:27,961 --> 00:08:30,896
Oh, I hate it when you call yourself old!

160
00:08:30,997 --> 00:08:33,795
- You're new to me!
- Oh, that's... that's nice.

161
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:37,392
Do they have a... a file or tapes?

162
00:08:37,504 --> 00:08:39,802
Oh, what's the use?
You're married.

163
00:08:39,906 --> 00:08:41,806
- Yeah. Let me ask you...
- We'll never be together.

164
00:08:41,908 --> 00:08:44,706
- Let me ask you a question.
- Let's just go back to what we do best.

165
00:08:44,811 --> 00:08:46,972
- Okay.
- Tweak me.

166
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,514
- George!
- Lucille!

167
00:08:49,616 --> 00:08:51,516
Hi. Uh, this is not what it looks like.

168
00:08:51,618 --> 00:08:54,587
It looks like you're tweaking her nipples
through a chain-link fence.

169
00:08:54,688 --> 00:08:58,419
- Yep. Yeah, that's it.
- Is this why you wanted to fight this thing?

170
00:08:58,525 --> 00:09:01,494
So you could run off
with this great redwood of a whore?

171
00:09:01,594 --> 00:09:04,654
Listen to me. She is a fan of mine.

172
00:09:04,764 --> 00:09:08,996
She has seen everything I've done.
You understand? Everything.

173
00:09:09,102 --> 00:09:11,093
Well, so have I...

174
00:09:11,204 --> 00:09:13,434
and I'm not going to put up with it anymore.

175
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,838
- Okay.
- You'll be hearing from Barry.

176
00:09:15,942 --> 00:09:18,877
All right. Hon?
Honey? Hon?

177
00:09:20,113 --> 00:09:22,013
- Oh, God. I'm a home-wrecker.
- Oh, no.

178
00:09:22,115 --> 00:09:24,174
- I never wanted to be that person.
- No, no.

179
00:09:24,284 --> 00:09:26,684
No. No, Cindi, it's... Cindi?

180
00:09:26,786 --> 00:09:31,189
<i>Michael came home upset that
his one-night stand wasn't over.</i>

181
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:33,191
You should have stayed with me last night.

182
00:09:33,293 --> 00:09:37,696
You could have seen me
get some major action from a major blonde...

183
00:09:37,797 --> 00:09:40,231
who just majored in marine biology,
if you know what I mean.

184
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:43,131
I don't know what you mean.
I can't imagine what that means.

185
00:09:43,236 --> 00:09:46,069
- I actually had a pretty interesting night myself.
- Really?

186
00:09:46,172 --> 00:09:50,040
- What'd you do, read the plea?
- No, I didn't have a chance to.
I went home with someone.

187
00:09:50,143 --> 00:09:53,374
- What's wrong with her?
- Nothing's wrong with her.

188
00:09:56,149 --> 00:09:58,913
- She's blind.
- Are you serious?

189
00:09:59,019 --> 00:10:03,820
I didn't know at the time. And now
I've got to take her and her dog to the park.

190
00:10:03,923 --> 00:10:05,891
You've got work to do.
You've got to read that plea.

191
00:10:05,992 --> 00:10:09,223
I know. That's what I was trying to do last night
when you put me up to all this.

192
00:10:09,329 --> 00:10:11,229
<i>- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.</i>

193
00:10:11,331 --> 00:10:14,232
I told you to walk away.
I told you to give a fake name.

194
00:10:14,334 --> 00:10:18,236
I did. Thanks very much.
I'm Chareth Cutestory, a pirate lawyer.

195
00:10:18,338 --> 00:10:22,240
- It was airtight.
- Boy, you had to work hard
to bag this blind girl, huh?

196
00:10:22,342 --> 00:10:25,072
- I certainly can't take advantage of her now,
knowing what I know.
- What? No.

197
00:10:25,178 --> 00:10:27,408
Michael, you can! Don't you...

198
00:10:27,514 --> 00:10:30,506
You've just won the gold medal
at the sexual Special Olympics!

199
00:10:30,617 --> 00:10:34,678
She can't ever find you again.
Don't you see that you're so lucky?

200
00:10:34,788 --> 00:10:37,951
- God! How do you not s...
- What's the matter with you?

201
00:10:38,058 --> 00:10:41,994
- Didn't you "bag" some woman
you're never going to see again?
- Well, I screwed up.

202
00:10:42,095 --> 00:10:44,427
I broke a couple of my own rules last night.

203
00:10:44,531 --> 00:10:46,465
She knows that I'm Gob Bluth...

204
00:10:46,566 --> 00:10:49,433
and we got married and I just...

205
00:10:49,536 --> 00:10:52,403
- What?
- Well, she was a darer.

206
00:10:52,505 --> 00:10:55,303
She's one of those girls
who just dares you to do things.

207
00:10:55,408 --> 00:10:58,002
- You married her?
- I needed a dare!

208
00:10:58,111 --> 00:11:00,375
<i>What had started as an innocent flirtation...</i>

209
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,040
<i>had turned into a series
of escalating challenges.</i>

210
00:11:03,149 --> 00:11:06,448
<i>Unfortunately, the evening was draining...</i>

211
00:11:06,553 --> 00:11:09,454
<i>and the one thing they never dared each other
to do was consummate the marriage.</i>

212
00:11:09,556 --> 00:11:11,956
Well, guess it's time to seal the deal.

213
00:11:12,058 --> 00:11:14,856
Oh, wait! What time is it?
Oh, God! "Seal the deal."

214
00:11:14,961 --> 00:11:17,452
My seal deal! I gotta get to Sea Land.

215
00:11:17,564 --> 00:11:20,499
I'm selling five of their sickest seals
to a third-world zoo.

216
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,400
- Did you say seals?
- Yes! I told you four hours ago, I sell seals!

217
00:11:24,504 --> 00:11:26,404
God! Do you ever listen to what I say?

218
00:11:26,506 --> 00:11:28,974
I'm sorry I don't memorize every word
that comes out of your mouth.

219
00:11:29,075 --> 00:11:32,169
Sometimes I just like to think...
think my thoughts.

220
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:34,746
We'll talk about this when I get home.

221
00:11:34,848 --> 00:11:36,975
It was hot.

222
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,643
Boy, the lengths you'll go
to sleep with a woman.

223
00:11:39,752 --> 00:11:42,653
Believe me, we didn't do any sleeping.
I had sex last night.

224
00:11:42,755 --> 00:11:45,349
<i>- But he really didn't.
- Yes, I did.</i>

225
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47,653
<i>And later, Michael arrived for his date.</i>

226
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,694
- Hey!
- I'm so sorry that I'm late.

227
00:11:49,796 --> 00:11:52,993
- I thought I smelled you coming.
- Mm. Yeah, here I am.

228
00:11:53,099 --> 00:11:54,999
I thought so. Did you smell him?

229
00:11:55,101 --> 00:11:58,070
- Did you smell the handsome man, Justice?
- "Handsome."

230
00:11:58,171 --> 00:12:00,833
- You don't have any evidence of handsome.
- Well, that's true.

231
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:03,238
But I can feel handsome.

232
00:12:03,343 --> 00:12:04,344
- Mmm.
- That feels handsomey.

233
00:12:04,344 --> 00:12:06,574
- Mmm.
- That feels handsomey.

234
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:10,513
So you didn't get a case of"I just had
a one-night stand with a blind girl"-itus?

235
00:12:10,617 --> 00:12:12,847
No, of course not.
One-night stand? Please!

236
00:12:12,952 --> 00:12:14,852
This is our second date now.
And I wanna see...

237
00:12:14,954 --> 00:12:17,718
And I wanna see you again tonight, so, um...

238
00:12:17,824 --> 00:12:20,520
if it's a one-night stand, I'm not very good at it.

239
00:12:20,627 --> 00:12:23,858
But now, listen, aren't you busy with the trial?

240
00:12:23,963 --> 00:12:27,558
Um, yes, of course. I'm very, very busy.
But not too busy for you.

241
00:12:27,667 --> 00:12:29,567
Not too busy for a little walk right now maybe.

242
00:12:29,669 --> 00:12:31,569
I'll be your Seeing Eye dog.
What do you think?

243
00:12:31,671 --> 00:12:34,139
- Okay?
- Oh. Should we leaveJustice here?

244
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,767
Um, yes. He'll be fine, won't you, boy? Huh?

245
00:12:37,877 --> 00:12:41,540
<i>Justice, stay! Stay!</i>

246
00:12:41,648 --> 00:12:44,208
Describe this to me, Chareth.

247
00:12:44,317 --> 00:12:46,717
Describe to me how beautiful the park is.

248
00:12:46,819 --> 00:12:49,879
Oh, I wish you could see it. It's just beautiful.

249
00:12:49,989 --> 00:12:53,322
There's an elderly couple walking hand in hand.

250
00:12:53,426 --> 00:12:55,724
- They're having a wonderful time.
- Yeah?

251
00:12:55,828 --> 00:13:00,629
"Already served, not to exceed six years
but no less than three..."

252
00:13:00,733 --> 00:13:04,601
Uh, three years is what I give them...

253
00:13:04,704 --> 00:13:07,935
and then one of them dies
and the other one is not too far behind.

254
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:11,340
I can smell right through you, Chareth.
You're reading.

255
00:13:11,444 --> 00:13:13,605
Leash your dog,
you...

256
00:13:13,713 --> 00:13:16,113
- Uh, yes.
- Yeah.

257
00:13:16,216 --> 00:13:18,912
<i>And George Sr. was working
on a roadside beautification effort...</i>

258
00:13:19,018 --> 00:13:20,747
<i>brokered by Warden Stefan Gentles.</i>

259
00:13:20,853 --> 00:13:23,185
- Inmate Bluth.
- Yes, sir?

260
00:13:23,289 --> 00:13:25,189
I want you to know that last night...

261
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:28,920
<i>I watched a very impressive videotape
of the title Caged Wisdom.</i>

262
00:13:29,028 --> 00:13:32,862
I was struck by the dual life
of the spiritual man.

263
00:13:32,966 --> 00:13:37,869
And I did very much enjoy the blooper bonus
footage at the end.

264
00:13:37,971 --> 00:13:40,769
Well, you know, I almost did strangle myself
on my own prayer shawl.

265
00:13:40,873 --> 00:13:42,932
A self-choking for the ages.

266
00:13:43,042 --> 00:13:46,170
- There's a Shasta can there
you seemed to have missed.
- Okay.

267
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:48,179
<i>- Moments later, Cindi arrived.
- Thank you, Warden.</i>

268
00:13:48,281 --> 00:13:50,613
George! I had to see you.

269
00:13:50,717 --> 00:13:54,312
I'm sorry I left before. I just felt so awful.

270
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,650
But I kept thinking about us.

271
00:13:56,756 --> 00:13:58,656
- Yes.
- About our future.

272
00:13:58,758 --> 00:14:01,124
- Yes, l...
- And I know for a fact we can have one.

273
00:14:01,227 --> 00:14:03,388
Okay. What evidence do they have on me?

274
00:14:03,496 --> 00:14:06,795
You keep talking about a fact?
You keep saying, "I know for a fact."

275
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:09,367
- What fact?
- Faith.

276
00:14:09,469 --> 00:14:13,701
I have faith my prayers will free you.

277
00:14:13,806 --> 00:14:16,798
- Faith is not a fact!
- Oh, yes, it is.

278
00:14:16,909 --> 00:14:19,571
<i>You said so yourself in Caged Wisdom.</i>

279
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:22,375
<i>George Sr. had said "Faith is a fact."</i>

280
00:14:22,482 --> 00:14:26,009
<i>Unfortunately, it was in the Caged Wisdom
blooper bonus footage.</i>

281
00:14:26,119 --> 00:14:29,486
Faith is a fact.
No. Faith is a facet.

282
00:14:29,589 --> 00:14:32,752
I almost said faith is a fact.

283
00:14:32,859 --> 00:14:38,661
I am going to trial because you don't
understand what a blooper reel is? Guard!

284
00:14:41,796 --> 00:14:44,629
<i>Back at the high school,
George Michael ran into Maeby.</i>

285
00:14:44,733 --> 00:14:46,633
I got an "A."
Check it out.

286
00:14:46,735 --> 00:14:48,600
Great job. Take some more money.

287
00:14:48,703 --> 00:14:51,729
Look. I gotta go.
I'm going to this fund-raiser for a sick girl, okay?

288
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,899
<i>This rang false to George Michael...</i>

289
00:14:54,008 --> 00:14:56,772
<i>who knew that fund-raisers,
a passion ofher mother's...</i>

290
00:14:56,878 --> 00:14:59,108
<i>were something that Maeby would avoid.</i>

291
00:14:59,214 --> 00:15:01,205
<i>And later, at the courthouse...</i>

292
00:15:01,316 --> 00:15:04,080
- Good afternoon.
- Thank God.

293
00:15:04,185 --> 00:15:07,245
So did you read the plea?
We've got minutes here, not hours.

294
00:15:07,355 --> 00:15:09,949
I did read it. Most of it. Um, I definitely...

295
00:15:10,058 --> 00:15:13,926
definitely read this, uh...
the first part of this first, uh, section.

296
00:15:14,028 --> 00:15:16,553
<i>- Uh, no. Did not read it.
- Oh, come on, Michael.</i>

297
00:15:16,664 --> 00:15:18,564
<i>How many times are you going to screw up...</i>

298
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:21,464
before the rest of this family
sees you for the screwup you are?

299
00:15:21,569 --> 00:15:23,469
I'm not the lawyer. All right?
Why didn't you read it?

300
00:15:23,571 --> 00:15:25,562
Excuse me.
I got busy with my other clients.

301
00:15:25,673 --> 00:15:27,641
- What other clients?
- He doesn't know about the divorce?

302
00:15:27,742 --> 00:15:30,233
- It's an annulment.
- Oh, I looked into that too.

303
00:15:30,345 --> 00:15:33,906
<i>You can only get an annulment
if you haven't consummated the marriage first.</i>

304
00:15:34,015 --> 00:15:37,075
Well, I guess I'll just stay married then...

305
00:15:37,185 --> 00:15:41,884
because we all know
that I closed that deal, right?

306
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:43,890
<i>But he really didn't.</i>

307
00:15:43,992 --> 00:15:46,119
- He was talking about my divorce.
- Your what?

308
00:15:46,227 --> 00:15:48,127
You and Dad are getting divorced?

309
00:15:48,229 --> 00:15:50,629
Oh, don't worry, sweetie.
No one is fighting over you.

310
00:15:50,732 --> 00:15:53,292
And don't worry about Barry reading the plea.

311
00:15:53,401 --> 00:15:55,369
We'll let your father rot in prison.

312
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,438
Take the plea. We're taking the plea!

313
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:00,770
<i>We're going to trial, you're going to lose,
and you're going to stay in there.</i>

314
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:04,311
- That's enough, Mom.
- For him? Nothing's enough.

315
00:16:04,412 --> 00:16:07,973
You'd think a man locked up in prison
would be able to abstain.

316
00:16:08,082 --> 00:16:12,314
Your father, with his disgusting tweaking!

317
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,820
I couldn't breast-feed any of you kids
because of that man!

318
00:16:14,923 --> 00:16:15,947
- Aww!
- Shh.

319
00:16:16,057 --> 00:16:18,048
They still look fabulous.

320
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:20,992
Lucille, for God's sakes. She was an informant.
She was working for the government.

321
00:16:21,095 --> 00:16:23,996
<i>The only thing I was pumping her
for was information, honey.</i>

322
00:16:24,098 --> 00:16:27,261
<i>An informant. Dad, are you crazy?
You're gonna blow this whole case.</i>

323
00:16:27,368 --> 00:16:31,464
It's blown. It's over. It's dead.
Take the plea. Get me out there.

324
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:34,303
Lets take the plea, okay?
Look. It's so nice and thick.

325
00:16:34,409 --> 00:16:38,004
<i>Oh, George, I should have never doubted you.</i>

326
00:16:38,112 --> 00:16:41,081
Even when you slept with my sister,
it was for a good reason.

327
00:16:41,182 --> 00:16:42,979
Got her to stop drinking, didn't it?

328
00:16:43,084 --> 00:16:45,348
<i>All right, listen.
This is all getting a little crazy.</i>

329
00:16:45,453 --> 00:16:48,388
We cannot accept their conditions
if we don't know what their conditions are.

330
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:50,754
Do you wanna read it?

331
00:16:50,859 --> 00:16:53,487
Uh, no. It is thick. Why don't we just take it?

332
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:56,325
- I could kiss you on the...
- Well, let's... What?

333
00:16:56,431 --> 00:16:58,365
<i>And so the family gathered in the courtroom...</i>

334
00:16:58,466 --> 00:17:00,366
<i>to announce their decision.</i>

335
00:17:00,468 --> 00:17:03,335
<i>All rise. The court is now in session.</i>

336
00:17:03,438 --> 00:17:05,269
The Honorable Lionel Ping presiding.

337
00:17:05,373 --> 00:17:07,273
Oh, we've got Ping again.

338
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:09,673
<i>Please be seated.</i>

339
00:17:09,777 --> 00:17:12,712
The prosecution has offered a plea?

340
00:17:12,814 --> 00:17:17,217
- We have, Your Honor.
- We've got Lizer.

341
00:17:17,318 --> 00:17:21,516
<i>Yes, Maggie was the most feared
prosecutor in all of Orange County.</i>

342
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:26,560
And, therefore, I would like to
bring your attention to Exhibit A.

343
00:17:26,661 --> 00:17:29,391
<i>Not because she was
a particularly adept lawyer...</i>

344
00:17:29,497 --> 00:17:32,898
<i>but because she won the sympathy
not only of thejury and thejudge...</i>

345
00:17:33,001 --> 00:17:38,564
And was that man in the room, not you, Doctor?

346
00:17:38,673 --> 00:17:41,403
<i>but often times, the defendants themselves.</i>

347
00:17:41,509 --> 00:17:44,034
l... I was in that room.

348
00:17:44,145 --> 00:17:46,272
Is the defense ready to respond?

349
00:17:46,381 --> 00:17:49,043
- What are you hiding from?
- You've got to call this off.

350
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:51,914
<i>You gotta get more time.
Get more time. She can smell me.</i>

351
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,988
She smells everything.

352
00:17:57,325 --> 00:18:00,761
- Objection!
- What?

353
00:18:00,862 --> 00:18:03,262
We haven't read it.

354
00:18:03,364 --> 00:18:05,594
- It's very long, Your Honor.
- Sit down!

355
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,828
We haven't read it. We're gonna get to it.
I'm gonna start right now.

356
00:18:11,005 --> 00:18:12,407
That's the blind chick you slept with?

357
00:18:12,407 --> 00:18:13,305
That's the blind chick you slept with?

358
00:18:13,408 --> 00:18:15,433
Michael, you're in bed with the prosecution?

359
00:18:15,543 --> 00:18:18,603
It's genius.
You can get all the information we need.

360
00:18:18,713 --> 00:18:21,443
Wait a minute. How do we know it's not a trap?
Maybe she's setting you up.

361
00:18:21,549 --> 00:18:24,950
It's not a setup, okay? She gave me her real name.
She said that she was a lawyer.

362
00:18:25,053 --> 00:18:27,146
I'm the one that lied to her.
I gotta go talk to her.

363
00:18:27,255 --> 00:18:29,655
- No!
- No, Michael! You can save this family.

364
00:18:29,757 --> 00:18:32,624
Please! Do the right thing here.

365
00:18:32,727 --> 00:18:36,595
String this blind girl along so that
Dad doesn't have to pay his debt to society.

366
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:40,691
The solution to all our problems is staring you
right in the face and it can't even see you.

367
00:18:40,802 --> 00:18:43,134
I gotta go talk to her.

368
00:18:43,237 --> 00:18:45,865
Yeah, I better get back to the wife.

369
00:18:45,974 --> 00:18:50,673
I think I'm going to take a scenic drive down
to the City of Industry.

370
00:18:50,778 --> 00:18:52,678
<i>And George Michael went to the fund-raiser...</i>

371
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,680
<i>for the sick student Maeby had mentioned...</i>

372
00:18:54,782 --> 00:18:56,682
<i>but was surprised not to see Maeby there.</i>

373
00:18:56,784 --> 00:19:01,778
We have been blessed to have in our midst a
child who has shown us the meaning of courage.

374
00:19:01,889 --> 00:19:05,347
Now let's show her the meaning of charity.

375
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,293
Please welcome...
Surely Fünke!

376
00:19:08,396 --> 00:19:10,489
<i>And that's when George Michael realized...</i>

377
00:19:10,598 --> 00:19:14,796
<i>Maeby had been making money
by pretending to be two twin girls...</i>

378
00:19:14,902 --> 00:19:16,301
Maeby?

379
00:19:16,404 --> 00:19:19,669
<i>one of whom was ill.</i>

380
00:19:19,774 --> 00:19:21,503
Somebody get her a cupcake!

381
00:19:21,609 --> 00:19:25,170
<i>And Michael went to Maggie's
determined to tell the truth.</i>

382
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:28,248
What a surprise. Come on in.

383
00:19:29,617 --> 00:19:31,847
- Hey, I'm in. Hello. Sorry.
- Oh. Hey.

384
00:19:31,953 --> 00:19:35,047
- I thought you were going to be my reader.
- Yeah? Oh, you're working?

385
00:19:35,156 --> 00:19:38,887
Yeah, I got a break.
I wasn't prepared, thanks to you.

386
00:19:38,993 --> 00:19:41,052
Mm.

387
00:19:41,162 --> 00:19:45,030
What about you? Don't tell me
another pirate is still roaming the high seas.

388
00:19:49,137 --> 00:19:51,367
Uh, hey. You know, let's make a deal.

389
00:19:51,472 --> 00:19:53,997
You don't have to do this anymore,
cause I'm gonna start laughing out loud.

390
00:19:54,108 --> 00:19:58,010
- Okay. That's gonna help me so much.
- All right. Let's go sit down.

391
00:19:58,112 --> 00:20:00,205
- So, uh, Maggie.
- Yeah?

392
00:20:00,314 --> 00:20:04,080
I am not trying a case.

393
00:20:04,185 --> 00:20:07,279
- That's fantastic! They settled. Great.
- Well...

394
00:20:07,388 --> 00:20:10,880
Listen, I know I shouldn't do this, but...

395
00:20:10,992 --> 00:20:15,691
but I am so behind,
and I really do feel as if I can trust you.

396
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,560
Yeah? What is this?

397
00:20:17,665 --> 00:20:20,133
Well, you ought to know. You can see.

398
00:20:20,234 --> 00:20:22,794
Maggie!

399
00:20:22,904 --> 00:20:25,031
- What is it? Seriously.
- Well, basically...

400
00:20:25,139 --> 00:20:28,575
it's an overview of the government's case
against the Bluth family.

401
00:20:28,676 --> 00:20:31,577
It's a summary of absolutely everything we've got.

402
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,579
And you're just going to give it to me?

403
00:20:33,681 --> 00:20:35,740
You're a lawyer. What do you think?

404
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,750
Do we have a case?

405
00:20:40,421 --> 00:20:43,117
<i>On the next
Arrested Development.</i>

406
00:20:43,224 --> 00:20:45,385
<i>Maeby attempts
to deposit her check.</i>

407
00:20:47,128 --> 00:20:49,824
<i>- Gob adapts to married life.
- Unbelievable!</i>

408
00:20:49,931 --> 00:20:53,025
The seal deal fell through. Three
of the seals died on their way to Chad.

409
00:20:53,134 --> 00:20:55,102
How am I ever gonna find
a maritime lawyer?

410
00:20:55,203 --> 00:20:57,137
- I'm sorry, did you say "seals"?
- Yes!

411
00:20:57,238 --> 00:20:59,206
I trade trained
seals for a living.

412
00:20:59,307 --> 00:21:01,571
- Do you ever listen?
- Do you ever stop talking?

413
00:21:01,676 --> 00:21:05,476
<i>Tobias is sent to break into
Maggie's house to steal evidence.</i>

414
00:21:11,686 --> 00:21:16,589
<i>Only to discover
that she's not blind.</i>
