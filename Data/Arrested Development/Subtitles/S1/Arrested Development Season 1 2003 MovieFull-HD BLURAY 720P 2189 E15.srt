1
00:00:01,154 --> 00:00:04,055
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:04,157 --> 00:00:06,148
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:08,250
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,895
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

5
00:00:19,706 --> 00:00:22,106
<i>Michael had begun to work weekends.</i>

6
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:25,575
<i>Unfortunately, this interfered
with the Saturday morning bike ride...</i>

7
00:00:25,678 --> 00:00:27,737
<i>he usually took with his son.</i>

8
00:00:29,282 --> 00:00:32,080
So this isn't bad, right?
just like a normal Saturday.

9
00:00:32,185 --> 00:00:35,177
You don't have to drive so slow.
I can ride my bike by myself.

10
00:00:35,288 --> 00:00:37,347
This actually doesn't
go any faster.

11
00:00:37,457 --> 00:00:40,051
I mean, I know you have a lot of work, you know?

12
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,060
It still doesn't mean
I can't hang out with my...

13
00:00:42,162 --> 00:00:44,062
Hang on one second.
This is Michael.

14
00:00:44,164 --> 00:00:46,928
Mom, I'm expecting
a very important phone...

15
00:00:47,033 --> 00:00:49,297
<i>For God's sakes!
I'll be right there.</i>

16
00:00:49,402 --> 00:00:51,734
<i>Dad. Dad!</i>

17
00:00:51,838 --> 00:00:55,205
Nice instincts, son.
Good reflexes.

18
00:00:55,308 --> 00:00:59,074
<i>Back at the model home, Lindsay
awoke late to find her husband missing.</i>

19
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:02,740
Maeby? Michael? Tobias?

20
00:01:02,849 --> 00:01:04,749
<i>- Work?
- Tobias had recently...</i>

21
00:01:04,851 --> 00:01:08,947
<i>been cast in a movie,
playing the role of a frightened inmate.</i>

22
00:01:09,055 --> 00:01:12,354
I ain't going to squeal, man.

23
00:01:12,459 --> 00:01:16,327
I ain't going to...
Oh, I'm not frightened! God!

24
00:01:17,363 --> 00:01:19,263
Lindsay, say something
to scare me.

25
00:01:19,365 --> 00:01:21,959
... me.

26
00:01:23,636 --> 00:01:26,605
Nope. Nothing.
Thanks for trying though.

27
00:01:26,706 --> 00:01:28,401
<i>You know what I ought to do?</i>

28
00:01:28,508 --> 00:01:31,841
I ought to check myself
into a men's penal colony.

29
00:01:31,945 --> 00:01:34,971
<i>Perhaps your father
could get me in.</i>

30
00:01:35,081 --> 00:01:38,175
Well, if he can go to work,
so can I.

31
00:01:38,284 --> 00:01:40,582
<i>Lucille, meanwhile,
was growing closer...</i>

32
00:01:40,687 --> 00:01:43,747
<i>to her recently adopted Korean son,
whom she called Annyong.</i>

33
00:01:43,857 --> 00:01:45,984
<i>- Much better, Annyong.
- Which isn't a name...</i>

34
00:01:46,092 --> 00:01:48,083
<i>- Annyong.
- but the Korean word for "hello'.</i>

35
00:01:48,194 --> 00:01:50,128
And I guess I can
comb my own hair.

36
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:52,357
Oh, please.
He's a little boy...

37
00:01:52,465 --> 00:01:54,865
and since he's going to go off
and work for 10 hours...

38
00:01:54,968 --> 00:01:56,993
<i>I want him to look nice.</i>

39
00:01:57,103 --> 00:02:00,800
- Thank you, Lupe.
- You got a job, Annyong?

40
00:02:00,907 --> 00:02:02,602
<i>- Annyong. Annyong.
- Annyong.</i>

41
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:07,237
At the banana stand.
Oh, his work ethic is unbelievable...

42
00:02:07,347 --> 00:02:09,713
unlike some sons I know.

43
00:02:09,816 --> 00:02:13,217
I'm a scholar.
I enjoy scholarly pursuits.

44
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:17,779
Suddenly playing with yourself
is a scholarly pursuit.

45
00:02:20,059 --> 00:02:22,323
Hey, Lupe.

46
00:02:22,428 --> 00:02:24,589
- What's wrong with Lupe?
- Oh, she's upset...

47
00:02:24,697 --> 00:02:26,722
because I told her
she couldn't take the day off.

48
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:29,563
There's a family reunion
in Catalina.

49
00:02:29,669 --> 00:02:31,796
Catalina? We're not going
to Catalina, are we?

50
00:02:31,905 --> 00:02:34,396
<i>Buster had an unfortunate
encounter in a photo booth...</i>

51
00:02:34,507 --> 00:02:36,975
<i>on the wildlife-populated island of Catalina.</i>

52
00:02:37,076 --> 00:02:39,203
No, Lupe is.
You see, for her...

53
00:02:39,312 --> 00:02:41,803
a family reunion might actually
be a pleasant experience.

54
00:02:41,915 --> 00:02:44,349
They've got a bus,
and they want to use the parking lot...

55
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,350
to this building as a meeting place.

56
00:02:46,452 --> 00:02:50,912
I mean, for God's sake,
it's not a hardware store.

57
00:02:51,024 --> 00:02:55,017
We can't have them hanging around like
freeloaders, looking for an easy buck.

58
00:02:55,128 --> 00:02:56,823
What's the emergency, Mom?

59
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:59,524
- I need money.
- I don't have time for this, okay?

60
00:02:59,632 --> 00:03:01,532
I don't even get to see my own son.
I'm going to work now.

61
00:03:01,634 --> 00:03:04,432
And while you're there,
find out from your assistant, Kitty...

62
00:03:04,537 --> 00:03:06,437
why she didn't send my paycheck.

63
00:03:08,241 --> 00:03:10,903
You get a paycheck
from the Bluth Company?

64
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:14,002
It's important to the company that
I keep up the image of my lifestyle.

65
00:03:14,113 --> 00:03:17,742
Illusion, Mom.
And I'm the president of that company.

66
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:20,944
I believe I'm the one that asked you
to start shopping at Quantity Plus.

67
00:03:21,054 --> 00:03:23,682
They made me apply
for a membership card.

68
00:03:26,726 --> 00:03:29,854
- It was humiliating.
- I'll see what I can do for you.

69
00:03:29,963 --> 00:03:32,022
Now that I know I'm the one
that pays Lupe...

70
00:03:32,131 --> 00:03:34,861
I'm giving her
the day off, okay?

71
00:03:34,968 --> 00:03:36,868
<i>Lupe, did you hear that?
Tell your bus driver...</i>

72
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,962
that he can pick up your family
at the Bluth Company parking lot.

73
00:03:40,073 --> 00:03:44,703
- Oh, thank you, Michael.
- My hero.

74
00:03:44,811 --> 00:03:47,336
Anyway, you enjoy
that paycheck when you get it.

75
00:03:47,447 --> 00:03:49,438
It will be the last one
I ever send here.

76
00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:54,111
Does that mean I have to go to your office
to get mine, too, or how's that work?

77
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,189
You gotta be kidding me.
All right. You know what, Buster?

78
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:00,623
Bob, in the copy room...
he quit today.

79
00:04:00,727 --> 00:04:03,662
If you want your money,
you're gonna have to work for it.

80
00:04:03,763 --> 00:04:06,596
Okay. I accept.
I'll take that job.

81
00:04:06,699 --> 00:04:09,463
I will work in the copy room.

82
00:04:14,007 --> 00:04:16,567
I wouldn't go in there
without knocking, Michael.

83
00:04:17,844 --> 00:04:19,744
Now, I know we've been
putting in a lot of hours...

84
00:04:19,846 --> 00:04:22,576
but we've got to keep our
heads down and power through...

85
00:04:22,682 --> 00:04:24,650
you know, and... and sacrifice.

86
00:04:24,751 --> 00:04:26,651
Don't mind me.

87
00:04:26,753 --> 00:04:29,153
I'm just here to pick up
my paycheck and get out of here.

88
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,290
Guys, go ahead
and take a three.

89
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,194
Lindsay, how can you just come in here
and ask me for a paycheck?

90
00:04:38,298 --> 00:04:40,994
Well, I usually ask Kitty,
uh, but she's not around...

91
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,591
and you're the only one here
I've ever seen before.

92
00:04:43,703 --> 00:04:47,139
- How long has this been going on?
- Dad hired me out of college.

93
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,767
- You quit college.
- Yeah, well, I had a job. What was the point?

94
00:04:50,877 --> 00:04:52,777
You have a job now.
Since Kitty's gone...

95
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:54,710
you can earn your check
by answering the phones.

96
00:04:54,814 --> 00:04:57,647
Michael, it's Friday.
Everybody coasts on Friday.

97
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,241
- It's actually Saturday.
- Finally. I'm out of here.

98
00:05:00,353 --> 00:05:04,483
- I'll see you Tuesday.
- I'm serious, Lindsay.

99
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:07,616
- This is why your employees hate you.
- They're actually fond of me.

100
00:05:07,727 --> 00:05:10,355
Okay, guys, back to the staff meeting.

101
00:05:15,468 --> 00:05:19,461
- Uh, Lindsay. Hello. The phones.
- Well, you said "staff."

102
00:05:21,074 --> 00:05:23,474
The zoning committee
feels that we're...

103
00:05:23,576 --> 00:05:26,545
trying to squeeze too many units
onto a lot this size...

104
00:05:26,646 --> 00:05:28,705
and we need to if we want
to make a profit.

105
00:05:28,815 --> 00:05:30,715
<i>So how do we fit
these units on there?</i>

106
00:05:30,817 --> 00:05:34,378
Are these fluorescent lights
bothering anybody else besides me?

107
00:05:34,487 --> 00:05:37,012
That's not what I want to deal with today.

108
00:05:37,123 --> 00:05:39,023
You and I have different
management styles.

109
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:41,685
I believe work should be fun,
and you try to crush people's spirits.

110
00:05:41,794 --> 00:05:44,763
<i>What's next, Michael?
Are you going to make dancing illegal?</i>

111
00:05:44,864 --> 00:05:46,729
<i>Is this the tiny town from Footloose?</i>

112
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:49,097
Good point.

113
00:05:49,202 --> 00:05:52,103
Can you go to your desk, please?
Be like Buster.

114
00:05:52,205 --> 00:05:54,673
He's been in the copy room.
I haven't seen him all day.

115
00:05:54,774 --> 00:05:56,674
<i>In fact, Buster had grown anxious...</i>

116
00:05:56,776 --> 00:05:59,438
<i>- in the confined space of the copy room.
- Bob?</i>

117
00:05:59,545 --> 00:06:00,944
Bob?

118
00:06:01,047 --> 00:06:02,708
- Bob?
- Bob?

119
00:06:02,815 --> 00:06:05,113
Bob?

120
00:06:06,619 --> 00:06:08,712
I need a different job.

121
00:06:08,821 --> 00:06:11,517
I'm having real trouble
in a confined indoor space.

122
00:06:11,624 --> 00:06:15,560
- Oh. Hey, coworker.
- How do you feel about working outdoors?

123
00:06:16,829 --> 00:06:18,729
Uh, what else do you have?

124
00:06:22,168 --> 00:06:25,035
<i>At the banana stand,
George Michael was also working.</i>

125
00:06:25,138 --> 00:06:26,969
I thought your dad
worked last weekend.

126
00:06:27,073 --> 00:06:29,303
No, last week he had to finish
planning the new subdivision.

127
00:06:29,409 --> 00:06:31,536
Oh. So did he finish it?

128
00:06:32,912 --> 00:06:36,746
No. Hey, are you trying
to make me feel bad?

129
00:06:36,849 --> 00:06:39,443
- Yeah, I guess. Sorry.
- Yeah.

130
00:06:39,552 --> 00:06:41,884
- I'm just bored.
- That's okay.

131
00:06:41,988 --> 00:06:44,183
I guess he just likes work
more than he likes you.

132
00:06:46,826 --> 00:06:49,818
<i>Tobias went to the prison
in preparation for his own work.</i>

133
00:06:49,929 --> 00:06:53,592
I have a letter of introduction
here from Carl Weathers.

134
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:57,534
<i>Fortunately, the new warden
was an appreciator of the arts.</i>

135
00:06:57,637 --> 00:07:00,936
It would be an honor to have you
research in this institution.

136
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,405
Oh.

137
00:07:02,508 --> 00:07:04,442
And, if I may...

138
00:07:04,544 --> 00:07:08,981
I have this script
I'd love to get to Carl.

139
00:07:09,082 --> 00:07:12,245
- Okay.
- The warden could easily be black.

140
00:07:12,352 --> 00:07:13,979
- Oh! Yes.
- Okay.

141
00:07:15,188 --> 00:07:17,088
Lets see, now.

142
00:07:18,324 --> 00:07:23,318
187 won't be free
till Tuesday... at midnight.

143
00:07:23,429 --> 00:07:27,729
And I can't put you into 212,
because there's already another actor...

144
00:07:27,834 --> 00:07:31,463
researching a role in there...
Steve Buscemi.

145
00:07:31,571 --> 00:07:33,004
Oh! Re...

146
00:07:33,106 --> 00:07:36,872
Well, l... I would like to bunk
with my father-in-law.

147
00:07:38,444 --> 00:07:41,106
Okay.

148
00:07:41,214 --> 00:07:43,341
Let's get you into wardrobe.

149
00:07:45,084 --> 00:07:47,780
Wow! Prison!

150
00:07:47,887 --> 00:07:50,879
<i>Meanwhile, Michael and Buster
had arrived at the construction site...</i>

151
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:53,720
<i>and Buster was actually
starting to enjoy himself.</i>

152
00:07:53,826 --> 00:07:57,125
<i>Michael, I'm reinforcing
the header!</i>

153
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,630
That's great, buddy.

154
00:07:59,732 --> 00:08:02,098
Listen, I know that we're
behind on the payroll...

155
00:08:02,201 --> 00:08:03,998
but as soon the zoning committee
gives me their approval...

156
00:08:04,103 --> 00:08:06,003
I know the bank's gonna release the money.

157
00:08:06,105 --> 00:08:08,869
Right now, I'm just asking everyone
to power through, sacrifice.

158
00:08:08,975 --> 00:08:12,502
I'll try, but these guys have been
working too hard not to get paid.

159
00:08:12,612 --> 00:08:15,547
I'll get on it. But until then,
I got Buster here to help.

160
00:08:15,648 --> 00:08:19,140
That's another guy.

161
00:08:20,186 --> 00:08:22,154
Michael.

162
00:08:26,359 --> 00:08:28,657
Michael.

163
00:08:28,761 --> 00:08:30,820
Michael.

164
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:33,922
- How did you know I was here?
- I called the office.

165
00:08:34,033 --> 00:08:36,763
You know, that Kitty is starting
to sound pretty damn sexy to me.

166
00:08:36,869 --> 00:08:38,928
- Maybe I oughta...
- That was Lindsay.

167
00:08:40,273 --> 00:08:42,070
- Anyway...
- Yeah.

168
00:08:42,175 --> 00:08:44,837
- What's Busty doing here?
- Michael got me the job.

169
00:08:44,944 --> 00:08:46,935
How did you get him
to do construction work?

170
00:08:47,046 --> 00:08:49,344
The guy's like the world's
biggest chicken.

171
00:08:49,449 --> 00:08:52,247
- I'm not a chicken.
- Yeah, he's not a chicken.

172
00:08:52,351 --> 00:08:54,251
He just doesn't like
confined spaces, that's all.

173
00:08:54,353 --> 00:08:58,346
- I thought it was open spaces.
- No, it's both. But I love it here.

174
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:01,586
<i>And the language
these guys use... rough!</i>

175
00:09:01,694 --> 00:09:06,063
<i>One of the guys told me to take my head
out of my bottom and get back to work.</i>

176
00:09:06,165 --> 00:09:08,565
My bottom!

177
00:09:11,471 --> 00:09:13,371
What do you want?
You want your paycheck?

178
00:09:13,473 --> 00:09:15,532
I usually get cash
under the table.

179
00:09:15,641 --> 00:09:19,236
- But if you made it out to cash...
- I got bad news for you, Gob.

180
00:09:19,345 --> 00:09:24,874
<i>Hey, pick up the pace, douche bag!</i>

181
00:09:24,984 --> 00:09:27,885
<i>- Michael!
- You too, candy ass!</i>

182
00:09:27,987 --> 00:09:29,955
"Candy ass."

183
00:09:31,524 --> 00:09:33,549
<i>With Michael gone,
Lindsay was taking over.</i>

184
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:36,059
Thanks, fellas.

185
00:09:36,162 --> 00:09:39,962
We, uh, finished the proposal,
and we're gonna order some pizza.

186
00:09:40,066 --> 00:09:44,230
Um, we were wondering if we could have
two toppings on account it's Saturday.

187
00:09:44,337 --> 00:09:46,805
Well, he's not here,
and since I'm in charge...

188
00:09:46,906 --> 00:09:49,306
I'm taking you all out to lunch...
the whole staff.

189
00:09:49,408 --> 00:09:52,809
<i>- We have to go to lunch!
- We have to go to lunch, you guys.</i>

190
00:09:52,912 --> 00:09:54,573
<i>Come on.
Lets go to lunch.</i>

191
00:09:56,415 --> 00:09:59,407
- What happened to the lights?
- Isn't this better?

192
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,454
Doesn't this just wanna
make you curl up and forget about the world?

193
00:10:02,555 --> 00:10:04,750
Lindsay, we need the light
so that people...

194
00:10:04,857 --> 00:10:08,418
- Where are these people going?
- I'm taking them out to lunch.

195
00:10:08,528 --> 00:10:10,359
Did you reserve a restaurant?

196
00:10:10,463 --> 00:10:12,954
- Are they taking their own cars?
- They'll figure something out.

197
00:10:13,065 --> 00:10:15,533
No, they won't.
You don't have a plan?

198
00:10:15,635 --> 00:10:17,330
I told you, these people are sheep.

199
00:10:17,436 --> 00:10:20,166
<i>All right? They'll wander off,
and you'll lose the sheep.</i>

200
00:10:20,273 --> 00:10:23,265
- You've lost the sheep.
- Oh, they'll be fine.

201
00:10:23,376 --> 00:10:25,276
<i>In the parking lot,
the employees boarded the bus...</i>

202
00:10:25,378 --> 00:10:28,677
<i>Lupe had rented
for her family reunion...</i>

203
00:10:28,781 --> 00:10:31,545
<i>thinking Lindsay had reserved it
to take them to lunch.</i>

204
00:10:31,651 --> 00:10:35,519
Well, I need this proposal. I don't know
how they can walk off and just...

205
00:10:35,621 --> 00:10:37,782
It's right here, Michael.
You weren't here...

206
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:40,791
and everything got done
while I was in charge.

207
00:10:40,893 --> 00:10:43,885
- See? Not so hard, what you do.
- You just got lucky this once.

208
00:10:43,996 --> 00:10:45,896
You really think I could leave here
and everything would be fine?

209
00:10:45,998 --> 00:10:47,863
I think everything
would be fine but you.

210
00:10:47,967 --> 00:10:49,992
I don't think
you can leave.

211
00:10:50,102 --> 00:10:52,297
If I didn't have that phone call
from the zoning committee...

212
00:10:52,405 --> 00:10:55,670
You'd have no reason to live.
I'll have it forwarded to your cell.

213
00:10:56,909 --> 00:10:59,571
Great. I'll leave.
Not a problem.

214
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:03,046
I, uh, can spend some time with my son.
So, you're in charge.

215
00:11:03,149 --> 00:11:06,141
- Try not to bring the whole company down.
- Like that's even possible.

216
00:11:06,252 --> 00:11:09,085
<i>So the employees
headed off to Catalina...</i>

217
00:11:09,188 --> 00:11:11,884
<i>providing the surveillance team
that had installed the lighting...</i>

218
00:11:11,991 --> 00:11:13,982
<i>with the opportunity
they needed.</i>

219
00:11:14,093 --> 00:11:18,826
- The place is empty.
- All right. Let's get in there
and bring this company down.

220
00:11:20,929 --> 00:11:24,831
<i>At prison, George Sr.
was making converts to his new way oflife.</i>

221
00:11:24,933 --> 00:11:28,494
You won't regret this,
LittleJustice.

222
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:33,337
Uh, okay, what say from now on
we call you David Ben-Avram?

223
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:35,501
What are you doing
to my guy here?

224
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:38,512
<i>Nothing. I'm just merely
providing him with options.</i>

225
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:43,017
This yarmulke will protect you,
David Ben-Avram.

226
00:11:43,118 --> 00:11:46,178
<i>Pipe!</i>

227
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:49,746
<i>I've got worse planned for you
if you keep trying to convert my team.</i>

228
00:11:49,858 --> 00:11:52,850
Hold it. Hold it, now. Wait.
Now, I'm doing no such thing.

229
00:11:52,961 --> 00:11:55,691
Both of our religions
have a lot to offer.

230
00:11:55,797 --> 00:11:59,756
There's theJewish notion of heaven and that...
that it can be attained here on Earth...

231
00:11:59,868 --> 00:12:03,565
and there is your belief in
the cleansing power of the pipe.

232
00:12:03,672 --> 00:12:06,470
No more teaching from you.

233
00:12:06,575 --> 00:12:08,372
No teaching. No teaching.

234
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:10,377
<i>It was at
that moment that George Sr...</i>

235
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,379
<i>- reunited with his son-in-law.
- Father.</i>

236
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:14,381
Tobias, what the hell
are you doing here?

237
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:17,941
I'm here to study with you,
to learn from you.

238
00:12:18,053 --> 00:12:21,545
- Teach me.
- There's no teaching.

239
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:24,387
<i>- There's no teaching.
- Who is this little...</i>

240
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:27,257
It's been quite awhile
since anybody called me a tyke...

241
00:12:27,362 --> 00:12:29,796
but, no, I am Dr. Tobias Fünke.

242
00:12:29,898 --> 00:12:33,390
Or, with your help,
Frightened Inmate #2.

243
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,595
And who is this
shiny building of a man?

244
00:12:35,704 --> 00:12:38,298
- Oh, I'm very scared right now.
- Oh, we're starting.

245
00:12:38,407 --> 00:12:41,501
Oh, yes. Let me get
something to write with.

246
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:44,340
<i>Back at the banana stand,
Annyong had arrived.</i>

247
00:12:44,446 --> 00:12:47,847
It looks like we're gonna have
to restock on nuts tonight, all right?

248
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:51,317
Now, listen, I know that that's
nobody's favorite Saturday night...

249
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,980
but if we just power through and keep
our heads down, we might be able to...

250
00:12:54,089 --> 00:12:58,617
<i>- Annyong and I are fine here.
I mean, you don't have to...
- Annyong.</i>

251
00:12:58,727 --> 00:13:01,628
You don't have to worry so much.

252
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:03,925
I mean, obviously, your dad
doesn't want to spend time with you...

253
00:13:04,032 --> 00:13:06,364
but, you know,
go to the beach or whatever.

254
00:13:06,468 --> 00:13:09,369
- He's just not around, okay?
- He no have father?

255
00:13:09,471 --> 00:13:11,598
Older lady adopt him too?

256
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:14,267
<i>No, he have father.
Father no love him.</i>

257
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:17,368
No, he love me... loves me.
He loves me.

258
00:13:17,479 --> 00:13:21,142
<i>So, all right.
Maybe I will take a little time off...</i>

259
00:13:21,249 --> 00:13:23,444
and go to the beach or something.

260
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:27,318
<i>I went to beach once. Next thing
I know, I'm in crate next to pig.</i>

261
00:13:32,327 --> 00:13:34,352
<i>Instead, George Michael
had decided to leave...</i>

262
00:13:34,463 --> 00:13:36,863
<i>for his father's office
and have lunch with him.</i>

263
00:13:36,965 --> 00:13:39,661
<i>Meanwhile, the white collar
Bluth Company employees...</i>

264
00:13:39,768 --> 00:13:42,236
<i>had made it through
the first leg of theirjourney...</i>

265
00:13:42,337 --> 00:13:46,137
<i>and were about to embark on the second.</i>

266
00:13:46,241 --> 00:13:48,801
<i>And Lucille,
taking Michael's advice...</i>

267
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:51,140
<i>returned home from Quantity Plus
with a problem.</i>

268
00:13:51,246 --> 00:13:55,512
Lupe! Buster?

269
00:13:56,685 --> 00:13:59,119
Annyong? Hello?

270
00:13:59,221 --> 00:14:02,418
<i>With Lupe gone and the rest
ofher family working for once...</i>

271
00:14:02,524 --> 00:14:05,015
<i>Lucille realized
she missed them.</i>

272
00:14:05,127 --> 00:14:08,358
Well, now, who the hell
is gonna unload the car?

273
00:14:08,463 --> 00:14:11,261
<i>Hola. Is Rosa still alive?</i>

274
00:14:11,366 --> 00:14:13,857
No? Hmm.

275
00:14:13,969 --> 00:14:17,097
Okay. This is not my day.

276
00:14:19,007 --> 00:14:22,238
<i>Michael, meanwhile,
stopped by to say hello to his son...</i>

277
00:14:22,344 --> 00:14:24,608
<i>and found out he had
gone to the beach.</i>

278
00:14:24,713 --> 00:14:27,238
<i>So Michael went
to find George Michael...</i>

279
00:14:27,349 --> 00:14:30,113
<i>and also try to figure out
a solution for his space problem.</i>

280
00:14:35,057 --> 00:14:40,188
<i>And then he decided that perhaps he,
too, should try a little relaxation.</i>

281
00:14:40,295 --> 00:14:45,927
<i>Back at the construction site,
Gob was also ready to take the afternoon off.</i>

282
00:14:46,034 --> 00:14:48,901
Screw this!
I have my pride.

283
00:14:49,004 --> 00:14:51,529
I don't care how much
they're paying me.

284
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:55,041
You got paid? I thought
we were all making sacrifices.

285
00:14:55,143 --> 00:14:58,078
Yeah, well, maybe it's time for some of
those big shots at the Bluth Company...

286
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,080
to start making some sacrifices.

287
00:15:00,182 --> 00:15:03,117
<i>I say we shut down construction!</i>

288
00:15:07,556 --> 00:15:10,548
Hey. Hey, what's happening?
Why are we stopping?

289
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:13,924
This is fun!
We should do this just for the fun.

290
00:15:14,029 --> 00:15:16,497
Easy for him to say.
He got his paycheck too.

291
00:15:16,598 --> 00:15:18,498
- Unbelievable.
- That's not right.

292
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,660
Come on, you douche bags.
We're all on the same team!

293
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:24,295
Don't listen to him.
He'll never stand up to the man.

294
00:15:24,406 --> 00:15:27,739
He's a chicken. A chicken.

295
00:15:30,178 --> 00:15:33,409
My whole life you've called me
a chicken, but that's over now.

296
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:35,608
I have nothing to prove.

297
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:42,517
That is not how a chicken sounds.
Chickens don't clap!

298
00:15:42,624 --> 00:15:44,592
- Chickens don't clap!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

299
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,923
That is not how we settle things on a site.

300
00:15:47,028 --> 00:15:49,496
We got our own way of
finding out who's a chicken...

301
00:15:49,598 --> 00:15:52,499
by a little game
we like to call... "chicken."

302
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:55,894
I hope you're
up to this, Buster.

303
00:15:56,004 --> 00:15:58,837
This is a game of courage,
a game for men.

304
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:01,374
Yeah, well, it's a game
I'm ready for!

305
00:16:03,111 --> 00:16:05,978
- Uh-oh. My seat doesn't have a cushion.
- Ready? Go!

306
00:16:14,256 --> 00:16:15,951
Yeah, I'm definitely
gonna need a cushion.

307
00:16:16,057 --> 00:16:19,618
<i>As the Bluths squared off, Lindsay dealt
with the news of the work stoppage.</i>

308
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:22,356
This wasn't my fault.

309
00:16:22,464 --> 00:16:24,864
- I thought you were Michael.
- So wait. My Dad's not here?

310
00:16:24,966 --> 00:16:28,299
Nope. He went out for lunch to have fun.
But everything's fine.

311
00:16:28,403 --> 00:16:31,566
I mean, if he asks, everything's fine.
My style works.

312
00:16:31,673 --> 00:16:34,039
<i>This place is humming along.</i>

313
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,811
So wait. My Dad said that
he was waiting for a call.

314
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:40,313
- That he had to stay here.
- Oh, no, he can get that call anywhere.

315
00:16:40,415 --> 00:16:42,906
- I just have to forward it to him.
- Huh.

316
00:16:43,018 --> 00:16:45,851
Hey, would you mind running
things for a little while?

317
00:16:45,954 --> 00:16:47,649
- I'm... I'm not really...
- It's not hard.

318
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:49,656
<i>So Lindsay headed off to deal...</i>

319
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,885
<i>with the work stoppage
problem at the site.</i>

320
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:57,857
<i>Lindsay knew Michael would be furious...</i>

321
00:16:57,966 --> 00:17:00,025
<i>ifhe found out
the building had stopped...</i>

322
00:17:00,135 --> 00:17:02,103
<i>so she had to find a way to start it...</i>

323
00:17:02,204 --> 00:17:04,502
<i>and that's when
she saw Lupe's family.</i>

324
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,335
Hey, who's ready
to have some fun?

325
00:17:06,441 --> 00:17:09,001
Uh...

326
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:11,271
<i>Meanwhile, Michael continued
his relaxation at the beach.</i>

327
00:17:11,379 --> 00:17:13,210
Okay, these units
aren't too close together.

328
00:17:13,315 --> 00:17:16,944
We can get away with this,
right, people?

329
00:17:17,052 --> 00:17:20,647
<i>All right. Just speed it up. Come on.
Keep your heads down. Power through.</i>

330
00:17:23,325 --> 00:17:25,520
Oh, no. Where is...
Where's my phone?

331
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,595
I used it
to dig the "B" unit.

332
00:17:27,696 --> 00:17:30,426
- You what?
- I'll get it.

333
00:17:30,532 --> 00:17:33,729
No, no. You're gonna ruin it!
What am I doing?

334
00:17:36,304 --> 00:17:38,204
- Hello.
- Hi, Dad.

335
00:17:38,306 --> 00:17:40,866
- Hey, George Michael, where are you?
- I'm at the office.

336
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:43,001
Lindsay put me in charge here
'cause there was nobody here...

337
00:17:43,111 --> 00:17:45,011
and she had to go to
the construction site...

338
00:17:45,113 --> 00:17:47,013
'cause the workers stopped working.

339
00:17:47,115 --> 00:17:50,448
Great. Now we're never gonna finish phase
three, and everything's gonna fall apart.

340
00:17:50,552 --> 00:17:54,579
This whole thing is gonna cave in, and
we're gonna be left with a bunch of...

341
00:17:56,892 --> 00:18:01,886
Great. Now my sand castle
has a giant pool in it.

342
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:04,898
<i>That's when Michael saw
the solution to his space problem.</i>

343
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,867
I gotta go, buddy.

344
00:18:07,969 --> 00:18:09,960
He's making a sand castle?

345
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:15,805
<i>George Michael noticed something too.</i>

346
00:18:22,717 --> 00:18:24,651
<i>He knew his father
had always loved him...</i>

347
00:18:24,753 --> 00:18:29,383
<i>but at this moment, he was actually
holding the proof in his hands.</i>

348
00:18:29,491 --> 00:18:31,755
<i>Unfortunately, it was at this moment...</i>

349
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,420
<i>that the investigators went into action.</i>

350
00:18:34,529 --> 00:18:36,258
- There's the kid.
- Our cover's blown. Get out.

351
00:18:36,364 --> 00:18:37,991
<i>- I've got a clean shot over here.
- No!</i>

352
00:18:38,099 --> 00:18:41,626
Get the proof.
He's got the evidence file.

353
00:18:41,736 --> 00:18:44,261
Come on. Come on.
I told you to find a stud. Go!

354
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:58,444
<i>Back at the construction site, Buster...</i>

355
00:18:58,553 --> 00:19:01,818
<i>and Gob's showdown was
reaching a dramatic conclusion.</i>

356
00:19:08,563 --> 00:19:11,464
Wow. Who won?

357
00:19:11,566 --> 00:19:15,832
<i>And for the first time,
Gob saw his brother as a man.</i>

358
00:19:15,937 --> 00:19:18,201
Let's get back to work, guys.

359
00:19:20,442 --> 00:19:22,967
<i>And Lindsay arrived...</i>

360
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:25,478
<i>suddenly trying
a new management style.</i>

361
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:28,344
<i>- What's this now?
- Okay.</i>

362
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:30,475
So you guys
don't wanna work? Fine.

363
00:19:30,585 --> 00:19:33,782
I've got a stair car full of Mexican
laborers that would love a day's work.

364
00:19:33,888 --> 00:19:35,788
"Laborers"? I'm a professor
of American Studies...

365
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:38,051
at the University
of Mexico City.

366
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:39,820
I took a dance class there.

367
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:45,332
I thought you were taking us to Catalina.
What happened to Catalina?

368
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:53,772
- You'd bring in scabs, just like that?
- Watch me. Go to work!

369
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:56,241
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
We're shutting it down.

370
00:19:56,344 --> 00:19:58,175
- Michael, I've solved this.
- No, it's not you.

371
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:00,179
It's me. It's wrong.
The plan is wrong.

372
00:20:00,281 --> 00:20:02,613
We gotta get rid of
the individual swimming pools...

373
00:20:02,717 --> 00:20:05,845
and put in a great big
communal one right in the center.

374
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:08,946
Lindsay, you were right. We've all
been working a little bit too hard.

375
00:20:09,057 --> 00:20:11,924
You can't manage by threatening
and pushing people...

376
00:20:12,027 --> 00:20:13,927
and sometimes you have to
reward hard work.

377
00:20:14,029 --> 00:20:16,725
Maybe reward it with a party.

378
00:20:16,831 --> 00:20:18,765
Right. I didn't mean tonight.
just some time in the future...

379
00:20:18,867 --> 00:20:21,028
when we have some
extra food and liquor.

380
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:23,195
Lupe!

381
00:20:23,304 --> 00:20:26,671
Lupe, I need help
with the groceries!

382
00:20:27,709 --> 00:20:29,609
How about just liquor?

383
00:20:29,711 --> 00:20:32,077
<i>And the two Bluth men finally did relax.</i>

384
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:35,547
Thanks for coming out. I've been dying
to get some time with you. I really have.

385
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,618
That's okay. I know how much
you care about me.

386
00:20:37,719 --> 00:20:40,153
Unfortunately, so does
the federal government.

387
00:20:40,255 --> 00:20:42,223
- Want more punch?
- Sure.

388
00:20:43,358 --> 00:20:45,326
Wait. The feds?

389
00:20:45,427 --> 00:20:47,952
<i>On the next
Arrested Development.</i>

390
00:20:48,063 --> 00:20:50,054
<i>Tobias gets an insight
into fear.</i>

391
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:52,326
Well, let's discuss
this bunking situation.

392
00:20:52,434 --> 00:20:54,231
You'll be sleeping
under me for a while.

393
00:20:54,335 --> 00:20:56,826
I sold you for a pack
of cigarettes.

394
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,671
<i>And the employees
find a new direction.</i>

395
00:21:00,775 --> 00:21:03,573
Whoa! Whoa! What are you folks
doin' on this part of the mountain?

396
00:21:03,678 --> 00:21:06,112
- We're lost.
- Well, I can give you a ride back into town.

397
00:21:06,214 --> 00:21:10,014
Come on. Let's go. Buck, Banjo,
get on up here. Come on, boy.

398
00:21:10,118 --> 00:21:12,916
There you go.
