1
00:00:01,155 --> 00:00:04,056
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:04,158 --> 00:00:06,149
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:08,251
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:13,768 --> 00:00:15,429
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

5
00:00:18,939 --> 00:00:22,136
<i>Against his betterjudgment,
Michael had recently set out...</i>

6
00:00:22,243 --> 00:00:25,838
<i>to have an uncomplicated
one-night stand with this woman.</i>

7
00:00:25,946 --> 00:00:29,347
<i>And at his brother's suggestion,
he gave a false identity.</i>

8
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:31,350
Chareth Cutestory.

9
00:00:31,452 --> 00:00:34,421
<i>And what started as a night
of passion with no strings attached...</i>

10
00:00:34,522 --> 00:00:38,891
<i>got complicated the next morning
when Michael found out she was blind.</i>

11
00:00:38,993 --> 00:00:42,258
<i>He decided to keep seeing her
so as not to appear superficial.</i>

12
00:00:42,363 --> 00:00:45,560
- If it's a one-night stand, I'm not very good at it.
- Wow.

13
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:47,691
But aren't you busy with
the trial and everything?

14
00:00:47,802 --> 00:00:53,206
<i>Unfortunately, the woman also
turned out to be his father's prosecutor.</i>

15
00:00:53,307 --> 00:00:56,538
<i>And so, Michael went to
Maggie's to reveal his identity.</i>

16
00:00:56,644 --> 00:00:59,306
<i>- But, before he could...
- It's an overview of the government's case...</i>

17
00:00:59,413 --> 00:01:01,608
against the Bluth family.

18
00:01:01,715 --> 00:01:04,775
What do you think? Do we have a case?

19
00:01:10,057 --> 00:01:12,890
<i>Meanwhile, Michael's son,
George Michael...</i>

20
00:01:12,993 --> 00:01:16,986
<i>discovered that his cousin
Maeby had been living a double life.</i>

21
00:01:17,098 --> 00:01:21,501
Maeby, what are you doing?

22
00:01:21,602 --> 00:01:24,571
I still don't get why you're pretending to be
two people, and why is one of you sick?

23
00:01:24,672 --> 00:01:30,076
- Hey, you don't get giant checks
if you're healthy.
- Please welcome Surely Fünke.

24
00:01:30,177 --> 00:01:32,338
Plus, who's going to
get mad at the dying girl?

25
00:01:32,446 --> 00:01:36,405
- Surely's dying?
- I figure I'll kill her off just before graduation.

26
00:01:36,517 --> 00:01:39,850
- Just so everyone gets really sad before prom.
- Someone's going to get hurt.

27
00:01:39,954 --> 00:01:42,821
Not to mention it's kind of disrespectful
for kids who actually have this.

28
00:01:42,923 --> 00:01:45,915
- Not a lot of kids have B.S. these days.
- What does that stand for?

29
00:01:46,026 --> 00:01:48,324
I don't know. It's B.S.

30
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,421
<i>Michael wrestled with the dilemma...</i>

31
00:01:52,533 --> 00:01:56,492
<i>of whether he should look at the evidence file
of the case against his father.</i>

32
00:01:56,604 --> 00:01:59,903
- Michael.
- Hey, Gob. What the hell are you wearing?

33
00:02:00,007 --> 00:02:02,635
What? Oh, this...

34
00:02:02,743 --> 00:02:04,768
The wife likes me in bright sweaters.

35
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:07,973
<i>Gob, in a series of escalating dares...</i>

36
00:02:08,082 --> 00:02:10,812
<i>recently got married to a woman
he had only known for an evening.</i>

37
00:02:10,918 --> 00:02:13,614
Your wife? She's still your wife?

38
00:02:13,721 --> 00:02:17,157
Well, I went to break up with her last night,
but my timing was not great.

39
00:02:17,258 --> 00:02:21,126
- So, I think we should talk.
- My parents are getting a divorce.

40
00:02:21,228 --> 00:02:24,163
Why aren't you wearing
that sweater I bought you?

41
00:02:24,265 --> 00:02:26,631
- What, you don't like it?
- No. Of course I like it.

42
00:02:26,734 --> 00:02:29,828
just because I like it doesn't mean I have to
wear it. I don't wear everything I like.

43
00:02:29,937 --> 00:02:32,201
Why don't we just get a divorce?
Everybody else is.

44
00:02:32,306 --> 00:02:35,901
No! We're not getting divorced.

45
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:38,740
She really wants to stay together, so...

46
00:02:38,846 --> 00:02:42,077
Well, least you finally
consummated it, huh?

47
00:02:42,183 --> 00:02:44,310
"Consummated."

48
00:02:44,418 --> 00:02:46,886
What is up with that "prosecutie"?

49
00:02:46,987 --> 00:02:48,921
- I hope you didn't break up with her?
- No, I didn't.

50
00:02:49,023 --> 00:02:50,923
And to make matters worse,
she gave me this.

51
00:02:51,025 --> 00:02:52,993
It's a summary of the evidence
that they have against Dad.

52
00:02:53,093 --> 00:02:56,585
Okay, Michael.
This makes matters better.

53
00:02:56,697 --> 00:02:58,824
Let's just destroy it
and move on with our lives.

54
00:02:58,933 --> 00:03:01,731
This is not the actual evidence.
It's just a list of the evidence.

55
00:03:01,835 --> 00:03:05,168
And judging by the amount of boxes she has
in her place, I have a feeling there's a lot.

56
00:03:05,272 --> 00:03:08,901
A feeling? Oh, don't tell me you won't
open it on ethical grounds?

57
00:03:09,009 --> 00:03:11,068
I'm not sure what I'm going to do.

58
00:03:11,178 --> 00:03:14,807
- What is with the insane moral code in this family?
- Yes, we did it.

59
00:03:14,915 --> 00:03:18,214
We're getting rid of the Ten Commandments.
The granite ones in front of the courthouse.

60
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,287
You know, all it took
was the threat of a lawsuit.

61
00:03:20,387 --> 00:03:23,083
You're involved with those protesters now?
When did that happen?

62
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,055
Oh, who can remember.

63
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:27,491
<i>Lindsay's involvement
began hours before...</i>

64
00:03:27,595 --> 00:03:29,961
<i>when, leaving the plea hearing,
she first determined...</i>

65
00:03:30,064 --> 00:03:32,089
<i>the Ten Commandments didn't belong there.</i>

66
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:36,761
And they won't even allow
me one lousy cigarette!

67
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:40,704
Honey, they're just heels.
They can only support so much weight.

68
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,715
<i>I've always been very passionate about
the separation of church and state.</i>

69
00:03:49,817 --> 00:03:52,615
- What are you gonna do with them?
- Give 'em to a school.

70
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,348
Can we let another family
bring down the Ten Commandments?

71
00:03:55,456 --> 00:03:57,390
This family's already done
more than its share.

72
00:03:57,491 --> 00:04:00,119
Oh, now you love
the Ten Commandments.

73
00:04:00,227 --> 00:04:04,061
And yet, you're the one who so conveniently
forgot "Thou shalt protect thy father...

74
00:04:04,164 --> 00:04:08,396
and honor no one above him
unless it beith me... thy sweet Lord."

75
00:04:08,502 --> 00:04:11,096
I'm not sure that one
made it down the mountain, Gob.

76
00:04:11,205 --> 00:04:13,765
- I told you someone would get hurt.
- If I knew it was you...

77
00:04:13,874 --> 00:04:16,104
- I wouldn't have been so worried.
- Hey, what happened to you?

78
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:20,010
He was trying to help some handicapped
girl up to the bleachers, and he fell.

79
00:04:20,114 --> 00:04:23,481
It's just a sprain.
But at least it's legitimate.

80
00:04:23,584 --> 00:04:27,042
<i>Ah, le clumsy adolescence.
It's a phase we've all been through.</i>

81
00:04:27,154 --> 00:04:32,285
Except for me. I was like a cat.
I always ended up on all fours.

82
00:04:34,895 --> 00:04:38,854
- Like a cat.
- Wait a minute. They don't
have ramps at your school?

83
00:04:38,966 --> 00:04:41,935
- Well, not up the bleachers.
- You should threaten to sue.

84
00:04:42,036 --> 00:04:45,767
- It's free if it's just a threat, you know.
- Hey, that's a good idea.

85
00:04:45,873 --> 00:04:48,034
No one's gonna sue anybody.
I'm not gonna have my son...

86
00:04:48,142 --> 00:04:50,610
start abusing the legal system
like the rest of this family.

87
00:04:50,711 --> 00:04:55,171
After all, we're gonna need it
for years to come.

88
00:04:55,282 --> 00:04:57,842
<i>And that's when Michael
decided to do the right thing.</i>

89
00:05:01,388 --> 00:05:06,018
So what do you think? Do we have
a case against this idiot family or what?

90
00:05:06,126 --> 00:05:09,095
Well, that's actually why
I wanted to talk to you, Maggie.

91
00:05:09,196 --> 00:05:14,828
You see, uh, it turns out that
I am actually one of those idiots.

92
00:05:14,935 --> 00:05:19,395
I might even be the main idiot. Well, I'm not
the main idiot, but I'm the idiot in charge.

93
00:05:19,506 --> 00:05:22,304
Yeah. I'm Michael Bluth. Okay?

94
00:05:22,409 --> 00:05:24,741
And I want you to know that
I never opened up this folder.

95
00:05:24,845 --> 00:05:28,144
And if you could see my face...

96
00:05:28,248 --> 00:05:31,149
uh, you'd see how sorry I am
that I lied to you.

97
00:05:34,521 --> 00:05:36,921
You feel sincere.

98
00:05:37,024 --> 00:05:40,983
Damn it. I have spent
the last five hours hating you...

99
00:05:41,095 --> 00:05:43,427
ever since I found out you were
Michael Bluth in court.

100
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:47,432
- What? How did you know?
- I'm blind, Michael.

101
00:05:47,534 --> 00:05:49,900
- I'm not stuffed up.
- You smelled me.

102
00:05:50,003 --> 00:05:53,734
- I smelled you, baby.
- Maggie, why didn't you tell me at your house?

103
00:05:53,841 --> 00:05:55,866
And why did you give me this folder?

104
00:05:55,976 --> 00:05:59,537
I was manipulating you.
This isn't the real list.

105
00:05:59,646 --> 00:06:03,343
- This is a wish list.
- I can't believe you set me up.

106
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,918
Well, you lied to me.
Chareth Cutestory?

107
00:06:06,019 --> 00:06:08,180
I know."Thou shalt not
make up a name in vain."

108
00:06:08,288 --> 00:06:11,917
But, you know, I walked into that court,
and I saw you there...

109
00:06:12,025 --> 00:06:16,553
- and... this can't happen, right?
- You're damn right this can't happen.

110
00:06:16,663 --> 00:06:19,461
Look at me. This could get me...
Are you actually looking at me?

111
00:06:19,566 --> 00:06:22,558
- Yes, I am.
- Okay. I could get disbarred for this.

112
00:06:22,669 --> 00:06:25,399
And your dad would have to
spend tons more time in prison.

113
00:06:25,506 --> 00:06:28,304
I gotta tell you something.
The thing that really gets to me is...

114
00:06:28,409 --> 00:06:32,368
that I keep hearing that Michael Bluth is so...
cute.

115
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:38,111
Well, I know Maggie Lizer is adorable.
You don't know what you're missing.

116
00:06:38,218 --> 00:06:39,947
- Really?
- Really.

117
00:06:40,053 --> 00:06:44,683
- So what are we gonna do?
- I guess we're just gonna
have to go our separate ways...

118
00:06:44,792 --> 00:06:47,886
- and agree to never speak about this again.
- That is probably best, huh?

119
00:06:47,995 --> 00:06:52,056
The least you can do is buy me a drink.

120
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:55,067
Hmm. Yeah. I'll stay for one drink.

121
00:07:05,612 --> 00:07:08,809
<i>The next morning, Michael,
once again, found himself at Maggie's.</i>

122
00:07:08,915 --> 00:07:12,282
<i>- And once again, berated himself
for the mistake.
- Oh, no.</i>

123
00:07:12,385 --> 00:07:14,580
I'm supposed to be at the prison
to talk to my dad in half an hour.

124
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:17,986
- I can't believe we did this again.
- It was so stupid.

125
00:07:18,091 --> 00:07:23,723
Incredibly stupid. It's like
we're making naughty sex even naughtier.

126
00:07:26,065 --> 00:07:29,398
Oh, no. I was supposed to be at the prison
to talk to my dad a half an hour ago.

127
00:07:29,502 --> 00:07:31,800
Oh, this is bad. This is really bad.

128
00:07:31,905 --> 00:07:34,465
This is the second most
unethical thing I've ever done.

129
00:07:34,574 --> 00:07:37,566
- We cannot pretend that
this didn't happen, Maggie.
- Or that it won't happen again.

130
00:07:37,677 --> 00:07:41,443
- You think it's gonna happen again?
- You tell me.

131
00:07:44,017 --> 00:07:48,681
- Let's just assume that it will
happen again at some time.
- Right. Right.

132
00:07:48,788 --> 00:07:52,189
We just need to, you know,
acknowledge this and keep it private...

133
00:07:52,292 --> 00:07:54,920
- and I don't think that there's
anything wrong with that.
- Right.

134
00:07:55,028 --> 00:07:58,122
I have a job, you know?
I'm trying to keep a man in prison.

135
00:07:58,231 --> 00:08:01,257
Right. And that man happens to be my father.

136
00:08:01,367 --> 00:08:04,996
- This could get ugly.
- Well, it's like the Ten Commandments saying.

137
00:08:05,104 --> 00:08:09,302
- "Be true to thine own self,
and to thine own self..."
- "Be true." Yeah.

138
00:08:09,409 --> 00:08:12,310
- Number seven.
- We'll just have to keep it a secret.

139
00:08:12,412 --> 00:08:17,440
- Our secret.
- Our dirty little secret.

140
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,313
- I think I'm ready now.
- All right.

141
00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:21,546
Okay.

142
00:08:21,654 --> 00:08:25,454
<i>Thirty-two minutes earlier,
Gob, Lucille and Barry met with George Sr.</i>

143
00:08:25,558 --> 00:08:29,688
- Where did you get this?
- They don't call me
a sleight-of-hand artist for nothing.

144
00:08:29,796 --> 00:08:35,132
<i>Gob had switched out
the file while his siblings discussed
the Ten Commandments.</i>

145
00:08:35,235 --> 00:08:38,033
<i>I've always been very passionate
about the separation of church and state.</i>

146
00:08:38,137 --> 00:08:41,573
<i>- What are you gonna do with them?
- Give 'em to a school.</i>

147
00:08:41,674 --> 00:08:45,542
<i>Can we let another family
bring down the Ten Commandments?</i>

148
00:08:45,645 --> 00:08:48,205
Now you love the Ten Commandments.

149
00:08:48,314 --> 00:08:51,613
Apparently, there are boxes
of it at the prosecutor's house.

150
00:08:51,718 --> 00:08:54,653
I tracked down the address,
and you should be thanking me for this.

151
00:08:54,754 --> 00:08:57,746
Michael didn't want you to have it.
Mr. Moral.

152
00:08:57,857 --> 00:09:01,349
Mm. Yeah, we did something
right there, huh?

153
00:09:01,461 --> 00:09:04,828
<i>- So what do you think, Barry?
- l-I haven't read it.</i>

154
00:09:04,931 --> 00:09:07,900
I had a really interesting
date last night.

155
00:09:08,001 --> 00:09:11,368
A woman who actually works two jobs.

156
00:09:12,772 --> 00:09:16,572
Well, it certainly looks like
they've got a lot on us.

157
00:09:16,676 --> 00:09:19,839
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh, you. I was raising the children.

158
00:09:19,946 --> 00:09:21,914
When was the last time
you raised children?

159
00:09:22,015 --> 00:09:26,008
Excuse me? I've got two in
the waiting room right this moment.

160
00:09:26,119 --> 00:09:28,349
<i>In fact, Buster and Annyong...</i>

161
00:09:28,454 --> 00:09:31,685
<i>Lucille's newly adopted
Korean child, were waiting.</i>

162
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:34,954
Wow. I wonder what
they're talking about in there?

163
00:09:35,061 --> 00:09:39,191
- They don't tell you anything, huh?
- They tell me things.

164
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:43,201
It doesn't matter though, because Dad
is gonna be in here a long time.

165
00:09:43,303 --> 00:09:45,771
No. We have court day today.

166
00:09:45,872 --> 00:09:49,831
They take plea.
Daddy come home. You out.

167
00:09:49,943 --> 00:09:52,571
<i>Annyong had hit a nerve,
and Buster recalled...</i>

168
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:56,308
<i>that right before George Sr.'s arrest,
he'd made a similar threat.</i>

169
00:09:56,416 --> 00:10:00,546
I said he could wear that tie.
It looks better on him.

170
00:10:00,653 --> 00:10:02,883
- No, no. Let me help you with that, son.
- Oh.

171
00:10:02,989 --> 00:10:07,119
Hey, enjoy yourself tonight,
because you are out of here.

172
00:10:07,226 --> 00:10:11,754
I'm not gonna spend my retirement
watching you wipe your nose on your sleeve.

173
00:10:11,864 --> 00:10:14,059
- I can't breathe, Dad.
- Neither can I.

174
00:10:14,167 --> 00:10:17,500
I haven't seen half this stuff...

175
00:10:17,604 --> 00:10:21,335
but they've got these kind of documents,
uh, we've gotta get rid of this.

176
00:10:21,441 --> 00:10:25,275
If you're thinking of stealing the evidence,
that is a very big offense.

177
00:10:25,378 --> 00:10:30,315
l-I think I'm gonna say that I signed
myself out about 10 minutes ago.

178
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:32,646
You're right.
You can't afford to get caught.

179
00:10:32,752 --> 00:10:36,279
I don't need my lawyer in prison.
We'll have Gob break in.

180
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:40,849
Well, gee, Dad,
I've got a wife now.

181
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,928
I don't think that I can
afford to get caught either.

182
00:10:43,029 --> 00:10:48,262
Good point. You might want to
change out of that sweater.

183
00:10:48,368 --> 00:10:50,768
Tell me again why this isn't wrong.

184
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:54,101
Look. We are just... we're two adults.
We've got absolutely nothing...

185
00:10:54,207 --> 00:10:57,608
<i>- Cops. Hide.
- Ms. Lizer.</i>

186
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:59,803
- It's Officer Kelley.
- Oh, hi.

187
00:10:59,912 --> 00:11:02,642
Your office has asked me
to come pick you up. It's a surprise.

188
00:11:05,118 --> 00:11:08,417
- I just winked. It's a surprise witness.
- Oh, great.

189
00:11:08,521 --> 00:11:10,386
- Um...
- How are we doing?

190
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:14,950
I'll just put my dog inside,
and then I will be right with you.

191
00:11:15,061 --> 00:11:17,689
I'll take the dog, okay? I've already
missed my meeting. You go ahead.

192
00:11:17,797 --> 00:11:20,595
- Just put him through the doggy door.
- Okay.

193
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,225
- And, uh, I'll see you in court.
- Yeah.

194
00:11:23,336 --> 00:11:25,804
- My dad's not gonna put himself in prison for life.
- Yeah.

195
00:11:25,905 --> 00:11:27,463
- Bye. Kiss.
- Oh.

196
00:11:27,573 --> 00:11:31,168
<i>And Gob decided to
pass offhis break-in assignment to Tobias.</i>

197
00:11:31,277 --> 00:11:36,180
<i>Hey, there's the cat. Sorry you couldn't
have been down at the prison with us.</i>

198
00:11:36,282 --> 00:11:40,343
- Dad was asking all about you.
- Oh. I doubt that very much.

199
00:11:40,453 --> 00:11:45,254
Look, I'm not gonna lie to you. He feels
you've been sucking off this family far too long.

200
00:11:45,358 --> 00:11:50,159
If you don't start pulling your weight around
here, it's gonna be shape up or ship up.

201
00:11:50,263 --> 00:11:54,529
<i>You know, try as I might,
I cannot seem to impress that man.</i>

202
00:11:54,634 --> 00:11:58,263
Isn't that funny... ...
I'm about to knock his socks off again.

203
00:11:58,371 --> 00:12:01,829
Yeah, I'm gonna break into this house
that's got a bunch of evidence in it.

204
00:12:01,941 --> 00:12:04,671
just to borrow it.
Ensure his freedom forever.

205
00:12:04,777 --> 00:12:06,212
But, it's a tough job.
Might require some agility.

206
00:12:06,212 --> 00:12:09,511
But, it's a tough job.
Might require some agility.

207
00:12:09,615 --> 00:12:12,743
This kind of agility?

208
00:12:12,852 --> 00:12:16,015
Let's go, little man.

209
00:12:16,122 --> 00:12:20,582
<i>Michael, meanwhile, had decided
to see what life in Maggie's world was like.</i>

210
00:12:21,627 --> 00:12:25,256
All right. Okay.

211
00:12:25,364 --> 00:12:27,423
All right. Okay.

212
00:12:29,502 --> 00:12:33,461
- Okay.
- This guy's the real deal. He's on the inside.

213
00:12:33,573 --> 00:12:37,532
- But, he's got some demands.
- This could be the break we wanted.

214
00:12:37,643 --> 00:12:40,874
- This is District Attorney Lizer.
- All right. What do you want?

215
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:45,110
Uh, l-I want immunity for
me and my mom...

216
00:12:45,218 --> 00:12:48,051
and I want my dad to stay in prison.

217
00:12:48,154 --> 00:12:51,385
- Also, can you send Annyong back to Korea?
- Huh?

218
00:12:53,092 --> 00:12:55,686
<i>- Hey!
- Justice!</i>

219
00:12:57,997 --> 00:13:01,296
<i>Meanwhile, Maggie's interrogation
of Buster was proving fruitless.</i>

220
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,894
Do you know anything
about your father's trips overseas?

221
00:13:06,005 --> 00:13:09,441
I knew I'd have a fun time
at home alone with Mom.

222
00:13:09,542 --> 00:13:14,343
<i>Fine. Did you ever see him
return from these trips...</i>

223
00:13:14,447 --> 00:13:16,574
- with anything unusual?
- Yeah.

224
00:13:16,682 --> 00:13:19,150
He came back home once
with a black statue...

225
00:13:19,252 --> 00:13:22,085
with an erect penis.

226
00:13:22,188 --> 00:13:24,816
It stayed in our living room
until my aunt objected.

227
00:13:26,359 --> 00:13:29,658
What about business associates?

228
00:13:29,762 --> 00:13:31,662
- I have none.
- All right.

229
00:13:31,764 --> 00:13:35,427
This guy's wasting our time.
Take away his grilled cheese.

230
00:13:35,535 --> 00:13:39,665
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

231
00:13:39,772 --> 00:13:42,935
If it's evidence you want, I know where
they keep it. According to my brother...

232
00:13:43,042 --> 00:13:45,875
there are boxes of evidence
in a house on Scenic View Drive.

233
00:13:45,978 --> 00:13:49,607
- Isn't that where you live?
- Yeah.

234
00:13:49,715 --> 00:13:53,776
And I'm headed there now.

235
00:13:53,886 --> 00:13:57,344
<i>Tobias, meanwhile,
had used his catlike agility...</i>

236
00:13:57,456 --> 00:14:01,586
<i>- to get the evidence at Maggie's house.
- The cat is in.</i>

237
00:14:01,694 --> 00:14:05,152
<i>Unfortunately,
it was just as Maggie came home.</i>

238
00:14:12,305 --> 00:14:15,274
Is there someone here?

239
00:14:15,374 --> 00:14:18,502
<i>Tobias, concerned about
Maggie's heightened sense of smell...</i>

240
00:14:18,611 --> 00:14:21,239
<i>set off to cloak himself
in her scent.</i>

241
00:14:38,097 --> 00:14:41,260
<i>- And Michael was at the vet's office.
- Justice is fine.</i>

242
00:14:41,367 --> 00:14:44,996
- Great.
- Although, dressing him up like a seeing-eye dog...

243
00:14:45,104 --> 00:14:47,572
- seems a little cruel.
- Cruel?

244
00:14:47,673 --> 00:14:49,664
Well, yeah, because he can't see.

245
00:14:49,775 --> 00:14:52,107
What are you talking about?

246
00:14:52,211 --> 00:14:54,839
Mr. Bluth, Justice is blind.

247
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,743
justice cannot be blind, Doc.

248
00:15:02,852 --> 00:15:06,413
He's got a handle and everything.
Come on, boy.

249
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,095
Maybe his peripheral isn't great...

250
00:15:14,197 --> 00:15:16,665
but he's been leading
a blind woman around.

251
00:15:16,766 --> 00:15:19,166
I think she's been leading him around.

252
00:15:19,269 --> 00:15:23,228
But that would mean that
Maggie isn't blind.

253
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,967
<i>In fact, Maggie wasn't blind...</i>

254
00:15:26,075 --> 00:15:28,669
<i>- but had been pretending to be...
- Son of a bitch.</i>

255
00:15:28,778 --> 00:15:31,246
<i>since she found it helpful
in taking the LSATs.</i>

256
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,815
"D." "B" places fourth.

257
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:41,980
<i>- "A"?
- Finding it a tremendous boon
to her professional life...</i>

258
00:15:42,091 --> 00:15:46,391
<i>- Maggie continued the ruse.
- I submit into evidence this wine glass...</i>

259
00:15:46,496 --> 00:15:48,964
with the defendant's fingerprints.

260
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:55,368
Don't worry. You're so ahead.

261
00:15:55,471 --> 00:15:57,769
<i>Her ability to see, however...</i>

262
00:15:57,874 --> 00:16:00,001
<i>was currently proving a disadvantage...</i>

263
00:16:00,109 --> 00:16:03,101
<i>as she couldn't reveal to the man
she recognized as Tobias...</i>

264
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:06,648
<i>that she knew he was there
without betraying her secret.</i>

265
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:18,790
<i>And Tobias was finding her an uncannily
difficult blind girl to outmaneuver.</i>

266
00:16:26,002 --> 00:16:28,971
<i>Their game of cat and mouse continued.</i>

267
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:36,207
<i>Until Michael showed up to return Justice.</i>

268
00:16:36,312 --> 00:16:40,271
Oh, Justice, what is it, boy?
What is it?

269
00:16:40,383 --> 00:16:44,251
Is there some jackass in my bathrobe?

270
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,388
Oh! I can't see!

271
00:16:50,493 --> 00:16:53,860
<i>And later, the family gathered at
the courthouse to respond to the plea offer.</i>

272
00:16:53,963 --> 00:16:57,694
They don't have a case against us.
I took care of everything.

273
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,600
- Something smells wonderful.
- Well, thank you.

274
00:17:01,704 --> 00:17:04,502
Would that I could say that
I wore it to impress you...

275
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:10,045
but, no, I'm afraid it's merely a cloaking
agent from a sadly blunderous afternoon.

276
00:17:10,146 --> 00:17:13,513
Who else have we got?
What about Buster?

277
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:17,211
Worst-case scenario
he gets caught, no more Buster.

278
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,118
I'm not going anywhere.
You're the one who's staying put.

279
00:17:20,223 --> 00:17:22,851
Not me. You.

280
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,520
What's gotten into you?
Have you been eating cheese?

281
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:32,631
<i>Outside the courthouse,
Surely Fünke was addressing the crowd.</i>

282
00:17:32,735 --> 00:17:35,033
<i>George Michael prepared to
confront her about it.</i>

283
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:38,539
Not just to me, but to all
handicapped kids out there...

284
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:42,771
who are sick and tired of sitting in
the front rows at basketball games.

285
00:17:42,879 --> 00:17:45,780
<i>George Michael spotted his father...</i>

286
00:17:45,882 --> 00:17:49,545
<i>and not wanting to appear to be abusing
the legal system, found a place to hide.</i>

287
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:54,919
<i>Michael, determined to expose Maggie,
hid to avoid tipping his hand.</i>

288
00:17:57,393 --> 00:18:00,885
<i>It was then, however, that Lindsay's
advocacy group had their big moment.</i>

289
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,634
Hey, George Michael,
what are you doing here?

290
00:18:05,735 --> 00:18:09,193
I just thought I'd come down
and see the family. See everyone.

291
00:18:09,305 --> 00:18:10,932
- Oh.
- That's why I'm here.

292
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,565
Well, pal, you don't need to do that.
You can head on home.

293
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:15,667
Why don't you go help that
handicapped friend of yours?

294
00:18:15,778 --> 00:18:19,737
- She kind of lied to me.
- I was recently lied to myself.

295
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:22,682
And for what it's worth, George Michael,
you cannot let people get away with that.

296
00:18:22,785 --> 00:18:24,912
It's just so hard to know what
the right thing to do is.

297
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:27,990
I know it. It's not like
there's some list of rules...

298
00:18:28,091 --> 00:18:30,389
- handed down to us from on high.
- No.

299
00:18:30,493 --> 00:18:32,484
Watch your head.

300
00:18:41,571 --> 00:18:45,803
<i>So Michael set out to expose in court
that Maggie wasn't really blind.</i>

301
00:18:45,908 --> 00:18:48,934
- She's right there. What are we gonna do?
- I got a plan.

302
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:52,344
Your Honor, the purpose of
a court of law is to find the truth...

303
00:18:52,448 --> 00:18:55,508
which is why witnesses swear on this.

304
00:18:55,618 --> 00:18:57,643
<i>After all, they sayjustice is blind.</i>

305
00:18:57,753 --> 00:19:02,087
Surely, she has enough sight
to catch the truth...

306
00:19:02,191 --> 00:19:04,989
before it hits her in the face.

307
00:19:05,094 --> 00:19:07,562
Objection, Your...

308
00:19:07,663 --> 00:19:11,099
<i>Unfortunately, Maggie had been
temporarily blinded that day.</i>

309
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,896
- I can't see!
- Bailiff.

310
00:19:14,003 --> 00:19:15,971
That was my plan.
What do you got?

311
00:19:18,274 --> 00:19:21,732
<i>So George Michael decided to
once and for all put an end to Surely Fünke.</i>

312
00:19:21,844 --> 00:19:24,574
- I need to talk to you.
- And this is the man who inspired me.

313
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,639
George Michael Bluth.

314
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:31,515
He is the one who is responsible for
the new ramps at our school.

315
00:19:31,621 --> 00:19:35,580
And he will carry on my legacy
and put an end to B.S.

316
00:19:41,898 --> 00:19:47,234
- Surely can beat this thing.
- No more B.S. No more B.S.

317
00:19:47,336 --> 00:19:51,295
<i>And Michael reunited with
Maggie, who had been kicked off the case.</i>

318
00:19:51,407 --> 00:19:54,103
I really thought you were lying to me.
I am so sorry.

319
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:58,010
Michael, I've been doing
this blind act thing for years. It's wacked.

320
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:01,743
- Are you going to admit that you were faking it?
- I think I'm gonna go for...

321
00:20:01,851 --> 00:20:05,719
"I was struck by the Bible
and it restored my sight."

322
00:20:07,323 --> 00:20:12,556
So what about us?
We were starting to establish some trust...

323
00:20:12,662 --> 00:20:14,721
except for all the lies.

324
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:17,025
You know, I was originally looking for
something completely uncomplicated.

325
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:20,591
Yeah. Me too.
Forget it. This is so over.

326
00:20:20,703 --> 00:20:23,763
You know, we're saying good-bye,
and this is actually the first time...

327
00:20:23,873 --> 00:20:25,966
that I feel that you can really see me.

328
00:20:26,075 --> 00:20:28,703
Yeah.

329
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:32,770
We're just two people
staring at each other...

330
00:20:32,882 --> 00:20:37,785
fully exposed in a court of law.

331
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:54,295
justice!

332
00:20:54,403 --> 00:20:56,928
<i>On the next
Arrested Development.</i>

333
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,440
<i>Barry gets a sign
from God.</i>

334
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:03,603
<i>I will obey your will.
I will lead a good life.</i>

335
00:21:05,748 --> 00:21:07,716
Well, the hell
with this then!

336
00:21:07,817 --> 00:21:11,275
<i>And Maggie is replaced
with a new, less generous, prosecutor.</i>

337
00:21:11,387 --> 00:21:13,878
I was made to understand there were
grilled cheese sandwiches here.
