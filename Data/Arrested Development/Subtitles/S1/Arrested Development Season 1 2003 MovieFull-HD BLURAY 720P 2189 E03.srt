1
00:00:01,163 --> 00:00:04,564
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:04,666 --> 00:00:06,657
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:06,768 --> 00:00:08,759
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:14,276 --> 00:00:15,937
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,980
<i>It was Sunday morning,
and Michael was making cornballs.</i>

6
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:25,246
<i>A Bluth family favorite since
George Sr. unsuccessfully...</i>

7
00:00:25,353 --> 00:00:27,253
<i>tried to market the device
in the mid-'70s.</i>

8
00:00:27,355 --> 00:00:29,915
Time to pull out the basket
and we dig into some hot...

9
00:00:30,025 --> 00:00:32,619
- Son of a bitch!
- Oh, look what you did!

10
00:00:32,727 --> 00:00:34,194
- You plopped it!
- I'll plop you!

11
00:00:34,296 --> 00:00:37,697
<i>It was a ritual Michael shared with his son...</i>

12
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:40,597
<i>before their weekly
bike ride to Balboa Island.</i>

13
00:00:40,702 --> 00:00:43,865
Be careful! Don't touch that.
Never touch that.

14
00:00:43,972 --> 00:00:48,204
I'm looking forward to our ride today.
We better go extra hard
to work off these cornballs.

15
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:52,269
Or, you could not eat the cornballs
and let your kid lead his own life.

16
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,314
Please. He loves this. Am I right?

17
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:58,045
Actually, uh, I can't really go today.

18
00:00:58,153 --> 00:01:02,112
- How's that?
- My bike needs a tune-up or something.

19
00:01:02,224 --> 00:01:05,057
Let's not blame the bike, okay?

20
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:09,995
It's the poor carpenter that blames
his shoddy tools for the... Ow!

21
00:01:10,098 --> 00:01:13,397
Christ!

22
00:01:13,502 --> 00:01:17,905
- That stupid cornballing piece of...
- You okay?

23
00:01:18,006 --> 00:01:21,134
- So I'm gonna go, okay?
- Yeah, yeah. It's fine.

24
00:01:21,243 --> 00:01:24,508
It's good.
That's okay. Have fun.

25
00:01:24,613 --> 00:01:28,845
- Getting too old for his daddy?
- No. He'll be fine.

26
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:33,080
And I would buy him a faster bike
if we weren't trying to save every...

27
00:01:33,188 --> 00:01:35,656
- Did you go shopping?
- Oh, yeah. Don't worry about it.

28
00:01:35,757 --> 00:01:37,918
- Excuse me.
- I paid for it myself.

29
00:01:38,026 --> 00:01:40,153
- With what?
- Company credit card.

30
00:01:40,262 --> 00:01:42,492
- You're returning that.
- But...

31
00:01:42,597 --> 00:01:45,122
- Get a job.
- Michael. Hey, the Cornballer.

32
00:01:45,233 --> 00:01:47,326
I thought these things
were only legal in Mexico.

33
00:01:47,435 --> 00:01:49,926
<i>In fact, the Cornballer
wasn't legal anywhere.</i>

34
00:01:50,038 --> 00:01:53,064
<i>But George Sr. continued
to market it there successfully.</i>

35
00:01:53,174 --> 00:01:55,768
<i>- Muy delicioso.
- Es verdad.</i>

36
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,780
- Where'd you come from?
- I had another big fight with Marta.

37
00:02:02,884 --> 00:02:05,785
<i>Gob had been having an
on-again, off-again relationship...</i>

38
00:02:05,887 --> 00:02:07,946
<i>with Marta, a Spanish-language
soap opera star.</i>

39
00:02:08,056 --> 00:02:11,355
It looks like I'm going to be
staying here for a while.

40
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:14,951
No, it doesn't. It doesn't look like that.
I've got a full house here, Gob.

41
00:02:15,063 --> 00:02:18,965
<i>He's just in a bad mood, Gob,
because his son feels suffocated by him.</i>

42
00:02:19,067 --> 00:02:21,501
<i>- Suffocated? Really?
- Yes, Michael. He's a teenager.</i>

43
00:02:21,603 --> 00:02:24,902
He's probably got a little girlfriend,
and, well, let's face it...

44
00:02:25,006 --> 00:02:28,999
- you are overbearing.
- Maybe I should be more like
you when it comes to parenting.

45
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:33,240
No borders. No limits. "Go ahead,
touch the Cornballer. You know best."

46
00:02:33,348 --> 00:02:37,682
Michael, if I could stick my
pretty little nose in here for one second.

47
00:02:37,786 --> 00:02:41,916
When I was a psychiatrist...
and this is before I became an actor...

48
00:02:42,023 --> 00:02:44,491
- You're still not an actor.
- Lovely.

49
00:02:44,593 --> 00:02:46,527
I saw a lot of this type of behavior...

50
00:02:46,628 --> 00:02:51,258
and I think what you're experiencing is
your son's very normal need...

51
00:02:51,366 --> 00:02:55,564
to distance himself from
his overbearing father.

52
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:59,299
<i>Am I touching something?
Hot! Hot, hot. Hot.</i>

53
00:02:59,407 --> 00:03:03,138
<i>- Be careful.
- Hot.</i>

54
00:03:03,244 --> 00:03:06,680
<i>- You all right?
- Hot.</i>

55
00:03:06,781 --> 00:03:09,511
Now, take my daughter, for example.

56
00:03:09,618 --> 00:03:11,677
She lives her life...

57
00:03:11,786 --> 00:03:15,517
and I get the pleasure of
guessing what that might entail.

58
00:03:15,624 --> 00:03:20,584
<i>Now watch this. Maeby, where are you
off to on this glorious Sunday afternoon?</i>

59
00:03:20,695 --> 00:03:23,459
- She won't tell me.
- I'm going to audition for a play.

60
00:03:23,565 --> 00:03:26,466
Well, that time it didn't work.
What play?

61
00:03:26,568 --> 00:03:28,695
It's for high school.
You can't audition.

62
00:03:28,803 --> 00:03:31,465
I was totally wrong.

63
00:03:31,573 --> 00:03:36,875
She's reaching out to her actor daddy.
Does anyone have an ice pack?

64
00:03:36,978 --> 00:03:40,607
<i>In truth, Maeby was reaching
out to a boy named Steve Holt...</i>

65
00:03:40,715 --> 00:03:43,047
<i>who was auditioning for
the lead in the school play.</i>

66
00:03:43,151 --> 00:03:45,585
"I would kiss before I spoke."

67
00:03:45,687 --> 00:03:49,145
<i>Maeby decided to audition as well...</i>

68
00:03:49,257 --> 00:03:51,623
<i>Iooking for a chance
to get closer to Steve.</i>

69
00:03:51,726 --> 00:03:53,318
And then we actually
get to kiss, right?

70
00:03:53,428 --> 00:03:56,056
<i>George Michael also chose to audition...</i>

71
00:03:56,164 --> 00:03:58,724
<i>Iooking for a chance
to get closer to his cousin Maeby.</i>

72
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:01,961
"I would kiss before I spoke."
Then there's a kiss, right?

73
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,732
<i>- Louder.
- And then there's a kiss, right?</i>

74
00:04:04,839 --> 00:04:08,900
<i>- Later, the cast list was posted.
- Steve Holt!</i>

75
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:13,572
- Steve Holt!
- Stand-in for Steve Holt?

76
00:04:13,682 --> 00:04:16,242
Steve Holt!

77
00:04:17,351 --> 00:04:21,981
<i>Michael went to get his son
a new bike to keep him from slipping away...</i>

78
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:25,422
<i>while Michael's mother was giving up hope
her son Buster would ever leave her side.</i>

79
00:04:25,525 --> 00:04:27,516
Zip me up.

80
00:04:27,628 --> 00:04:30,256
<i>Usually at this time of year...</i>

81
00:04:30,364 --> 00:04:33,026
<i>Buster would return to
his post-graduate studies.</i>

82
00:04:33,133 --> 00:04:35,863
<i>But without the resources to afford it...</i>

83
00:04:35,969 --> 00:04:39,029
<i>his summer vacation
was extending into the fall.</i>

84
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:41,369
<i>Mom! Mom!</i>

85
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:47,376
<i>And Lucille was beginning to resent it.</i>

86
00:04:47,481 --> 00:04:49,449
What?

87
00:04:49,549 --> 00:04:52,677
Hi, Mama, it's Linds.

88
00:04:52,786 --> 00:04:56,722
It'll fly out on its own.
Why are you calling me? What do you need?

89
00:04:56,823 --> 00:04:59,621
Very nice, Mom.
I don't need anything.

90
00:04:59,726 --> 00:05:02,388
My daughter needs
some new school clothes.

91
00:05:02,496 --> 00:05:04,794
Buster!

92
00:05:04,898 --> 00:05:08,356
- It's a bird.
- I know it's a bird. I'm on the phone.

93
00:05:08,468 --> 00:05:12,131
- It walked on my pillow.
- Look, I have a child that
costs me money too, you know.

94
00:05:12,239 --> 00:05:15,299
- Why can't you get a job?
- What is it with this family and working?

95
00:05:15,409 --> 00:05:18,401
Michael just gave me the exact
same lecture in front of everybody.

96
00:05:18,512 --> 00:05:21,037
Everybody? Who's everybody?

97
00:05:21,148 --> 00:05:24,914
- Who's everybody?
- You know, the kids, Gob, Tobias, everybody.

98
00:05:25,018 --> 00:05:27,646
He didn't invite Buster.

99
00:05:27,754 --> 00:05:30,382
Buster's his brother too.
What's wrong with Buster?

100
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:33,118
<i>And even as she asked
the question, Lucille realized...</i>

101
00:05:33,226 --> 00:05:36,593
<i>that perhaps it was time to
let her own baby bird fly away.</i>

102
00:05:36,697 --> 00:05:38,528
<i>- Why do I have to take him?
- Because he's your brother.</i>

103
00:05:38,632 --> 00:05:42,762
You run around with everyone else,
going on bike rides, making cornholes.

104
00:05:42,869 --> 00:05:47,602
- Mom, listen...
- Everyone's laughing, riding
and cornholing except Buster.

105
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:51,906
And I know he's not the sharpest knife
in the drawer, but he's sensitive, Michael...

106
00:05:52,012 --> 00:05:54,640
and you could pretend
to be interested in him.

107
00:05:54,748 --> 00:05:57,876
Fine. He can hang out,
but he's going to work, okay?

108
00:05:57,984 --> 00:06:00,782
This is not going to be
a day at the beach.

109
00:06:00,887 --> 00:06:04,220
Th-That's cool. Mom packed me
a change of clothes.

110
00:06:04,324 --> 00:06:09,352
<i>So Buster stayed and Michael
made him build the new bike.</i>

111
00:06:09,463 --> 00:06:13,092
- It's in the big box in my office. Hey.
- Michael.

112
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,000
Gob, what are you doing here,
and why are you in a bathrobe?

113
00:06:17,104 --> 00:06:19,902
What's he doing here?
Why is he in his bathing suit?

114
00:06:20,006 --> 00:06:22,474
Mom dropped me off
to spend time with Michael.

115
00:06:22,576 --> 00:06:25,875
Spend time with Michael,
or to serve her own menopausal needs?

116
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:29,471
She's always got to wedge herself in
the middle of us, so she can control everything.

117
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:34,316
<i>Yeah.
Mom's awesome.</i>

118
00:06:34,421 --> 00:06:36,321
Maybe we should call her.

119
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,488
- So why are you in your robe?
- I camped out in the boardroom last night.

120
00:06:42,596 --> 00:06:44,996
What with you kicking me
out of your house...

121
00:06:45,098 --> 00:06:46,998
there are few places left
that you have that I can stay.

122
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,729
Hmm. Well, you can't stay here either.

123
00:06:50,837 --> 00:06:54,295
Let me ask you something.

124
00:06:54,407 --> 00:06:57,706
Is this a business decision, or is it personal?

125
00:06:57,811 --> 00:07:00,609
'Cause if it's business,
I'll go away happily.

126
00:07:00,714 --> 00:07:05,515
But if it's personal, I'll go away.
But I won't be happy.

127
00:07:06,953 --> 00:07:09,649
It's personal.

128
00:07:12,359 --> 00:07:14,293
I am so sorry.

129
00:07:14,394 --> 00:07:18,330
<i>Michael's son, meanwhile, was
waiting with his cousin for first rehearsal.</i>

130
00:07:18,431 --> 00:07:22,197
- I'm surprised you tried out for this.
- Yeah. I just love the theater.

131
00:07:22,302 --> 00:07:24,463
That's great. I'm just doing it
to kiss Steve Holt.

132
00:07:24,571 --> 00:07:28,871
Well, actually, I think I'm gonna quit.
Yeah, theater's dead.

133
00:07:28,975 --> 00:07:32,376
But, he's always going to be at football
practice, so I'm gonna have to kiss the stand-in.

134
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,108
But, no. No. I love the theater...

135
00:07:36,216 --> 00:07:40,448
and I gave my word, so I'm back in.

136
00:07:40,554 --> 00:07:43,455
<i>Tobias, meanwhile,
stopped by the school.</i>

137
00:07:43,557 --> 00:07:47,516
- I know why you're doing this.
- Dad. What are you doing here? Go away.

138
00:07:47,627 --> 00:07:51,620
Yes, because the director
might be here soon, right? Oops. Too late.

139
00:07:51,731 --> 00:07:53,631
He's already here.

140
00:07:53,733 --> 00:07:57,863
Hello, everyone,
and welcome to the theater.

141
00:08:01,241 --> 00:08:03,709
I am Dr. Tobias Fünke...

142
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:08,270
and I will be your new director.

143
00:08:10,517 --> 00:08:12,747
Oh, my God.

144
00:08:12,853 --> 00:08:16,482
<i>Tobias had gotten the directing
job by meeting with the school principal.</i>

145
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,751
And you tell me you've got
some P.E. teacher directing?

146
00:08:18,859 --> 00:08:22,317
That just makes me wanna
puke all over your head, sir.

147
00:08:22,429 --> 00:08:26,229
Give me a chance
to tell the Bard's tale...

148
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,460
and I give you my word
on humble knee...

149
00:08:28,568 --> 00:08:33,767
whence you shall not say
it wasn't e'er to be.

150
00:08:33,874 --> 00:08:37,833
- Jerry, you cool with this?
- Sure. Let the little fruit do it.

151
00:08:37,944 --> 00:08:40,572
<i>- Huzzah!
- As the days went by...</i>

152
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,980
<i>Buster's apprenticeship was proving
more trying than Michael had anticipated.</i>

153
00:08:45,085 --> 00:08:47,576
We're excited. We want your business.

154
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:55,350
And, uh, everybody at the Bluth Company...

155
00:08:55,462 --> 00:08:57,293
Here I go again.

156
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,425
<i>Andjust when
he could take no more...</i>

157
00:09:02,535 --> 00:09:05,504
And we're back on track. And we're focused.

158
00:09:05,605 --> 00:09:07,505
And, Buster...

159
00:09:07,607 --> 00:09:11,600
<i>you can't do that
in the snack room, pal?</i>

160
00:09:11,711 --> 00:09:13,975
Mom told me to
stay away from microwaves.

161
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,708
<i>And besides, this is gonna be...</i>

162
00:09:16,816 --> 00:09:20,308
the most bitchingly fast bike
in all of Orange County.

163
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,888
- Really?
- Your son is gonna love it.

164
00:09:22,989 --> 00:09:28,120
Well, I guess 3:40 is as good a time
as any to call it a day.

165
00:09:28,228 --> 00:09:31,493
<i>So Michael left for the high school
hoping to reconnect with his son...</i>

166
00:09:31,598 --> 00:09:36,729
<i>while Tobias's attempt to reconnect with
his daughter hit a snag.</i>

167
00:09:36,836 --> 00:09:39,236
Stop! Stop it. It's all wrong.

168
00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:41,671
<i>- But we were just about to do the kiss...
- Kiss. I know.</i>

169
00:09:41,775 --> 00:09:46,109
It doesn't work. Look, you are
playing adults with fully...

170
00:09:48,048 --> 00:09:51,074
Pick that up, please.
With fully formed libidos...

171
00:09:51,184 --> 00:09:54,813
<i>not two young men
playing grab-ass in the shower.</i>

172
00:09:54,921 --> 00:09:59,517
Would you hold the work, please? Oh, Michael.

173
00:09:59,626 --> 00:10:02,857
- Dad, wh...
- So, you're in a play, huh?

174
00:10:02,963 --> 00:10:04,863
<i>I'm not.</i>

175
00:10:04,965 --> 00:10:08,196
- I quit.
- Maeby.

176
00:10:09,636 --> 00:10:12,036
- Why didn't you tell me?
- It's not really important.

177
00:10:12,138 --> 00:10:15,699
- I'm just a stand-in.
- And you're ashamed?

178
00:10:15,809 --> 00:10:19,108
Well, this should
cheer you up. Hmm?

179
00:10:19,212 --> 00:10:21,373
I left work early. I thought maybe
we'd go for a ride today.

180
00:10:21,481 --> 00:10:25,383
- No, I can't go on a bike ride right now.
- Why, because of the play?

181
00:10:25,485 --> 00:10:28,283
- You're just a stand-in.
- No, no. It's not the play. It's just...

182
00:10:28,388 --> 00:10:32,188
You know, I can't go on a million bike rides
whenever you want me to.

183
00:10:32,292 --> 00:10:35,557
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Hey, is it about a girl?

184
00:10:35,662 --> 00:10:37,687
- No! It's not. Just drop it, Dad.
- You can tell me.

185
00:10:40,233 --> 00:10:42,224
What, is Lindsay right?
Am I really suffocating him?

186
00:10:42,335 --> 00:10:47,671
Well, they're different people every day,
teenagers. Hormones all ablaze.

187
00:10:47,774 --> 00:10:50,242
Except, of course,
when they're onstage when I need it.

188
00:10:50,343 --> 00:10:52,971
No, he said it wasn't about a girl.

189
00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:55,741
Maybe he really is pulling away.

190
00:10:58,685 --> 00:11:00,414
Not a girl?

191
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,978
Of course.

192
00:11:06,426 --> 00:11:10,226
Methinks a Cupid I shall play.

193
00:11:12,665 --> 00:11:16,157
Mm. Mmm. Mmm.

194
00:11:17,237 --> 00:11:20,035
<i>Tobias came up with
a new plan for the play...</i>

195
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:23,303
<i>- and a way to connect to George Michael.
- I know why you're in the play.</i>

196
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:25,674
- What?
- Watch this.

197
00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:28,907
Okay, everybody.
Well, we've lost a leading lady...

198
00:11:29,016 --> 00:11:32,816
but did you know in Shakespeare's day
that the women's roles...

199
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,548
were played by men?

200
00:11:35,656 --> 00:11:37,749
Fancy that.

201
00:11:38,825 --> 00:11:41,293
Hmm.

202
00:11:41,395 --> 00:11:44,193
George Michael,
you know Steven's lines, yes?

203
00:11:44,298 --> 00:11:46,323
- Sort of.
- Fine. Then you are my Benedict.

204
00:11:46,433 --> 00:11:49,732
- And Steven Holt... Where is Steven Holt?
- Steve Holt!

205
00:11:49,836 --> 00:11:53,636
Yes. Get ready for the acting challenge
of your sweet young life, fair lady.

206
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,765
For you are my Beatrice.

207
00:11:55,876 --> 00:11:58,367
Beatrice!

208
00:11:58,478 --> 00:12:02,278
Let's take it from "Peace,
I will stop thy mouth."

209
00:12:02,382 --> 00:12:06,341
Now we'll see if some sparks fly.

210
00:12:07,955 --> 00:12:10,753
<i>As George Michael
contemplated kissing his rival...</i>

211
00:12:10,857 --> 00:12:12,688
<i>Michael sought his father's advice.</i>

212
00:12:12,793 --> 00:12:16,593
- You think you never hurt me?
- What are you talking about?
When have I ever rebelled?

213
00:12:16,697 --> 00:12:19,666
- I never see you anymore, Michael.
- You're in prison.

214
00:12:19,766 --> 00:12:21,700
And I was here yesterday.

215
00:12:21,802 --> 00:12:24,965
Oh, yeah. That's-That's... I'm sorry.

216
00:12:25,072 --> 00:12:28,405
I couldn't break away from the poker game.
Capital "G" was down to his boxers.

217
00:12:28,508 --> 00:12:31,477
- Strip poker?
- Yeah, and it's tough.

218
00:12:31,578 --> 00:12:34,979
We can really
only play about two hands.

219
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:38,978
Listen...

220
00:12:39,086 --> 00:12:42,613
Let him go. Let your son go.

221
00:12:42,723 --> 00:12:45,123
I can't do that, Dad. He needs me.

222
00:12:45,225 --> 00:12:48,592
Michael, you don't want to make
the same mistake your mom made with Buster.

223
00:12:48,695 --> 00:12:51,823
<i>- Yeah, boy. What happened there?
- I really don't know.</i>

224
00:12:51,932 --> 00:12:55,060
Maybe it was the 11 months
he spent in the womb.

225
00:12:55,168 --> 00:12:57,966
The doctor said there were claw marks
on the walls of her uterus, but...

226
00:12:58,071 --> 00:13:01,507
he was our miracle baby, you know?

227
00:13:01,608 --> 00:13:04,168
And l-I was just too burned out
on raising you guys to care.

228
00:13:04,277 --> 00:13:07,246
So, he turned out a little, uh, soft.

229
00:13:07,347 --> 00:13:10,646
A little doughy.

230
00:13:10,751 --> 00:13:12,878
I don't know. Maybe-Maybe it was my fault.

231
00:13:12,986 --> 00:13:16,786
Maybe I just ignored the guy.

232
00:13:18,692 --> 00:13:23,095
Wow. We're just blowing
through nap time, aren't we?

233
00:13:25,465 --> 00:13:27,933
Yeah, I gotta let my son go.

234
00:13:30,137 --> 00:13:33,664
<i>Lindsay, meanwhile,
still had the dress...</i>

235
00:13:33,774 --> 00:13:37,335
<i>- and she was starting to get
some positive reactions to it.
- Look at you.</i>

236
00:13:37,444 --> 00:13:40,106
I am.

237
00:13:40,213 --> 00:13:43,341
<i>So she decided to hide it
in the attic crawl space.</i>

238
00:13:55,962 --> 00:13:59,557
Are you crazy? I'm a magician.
I make my living with my hands.

239
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:02,635
- And if I'm going to be staying here...
- Staying here?

240
00:14:02,736 --> 00:14:04,328
What, did that Mexican throw you out?

241
00:14:04,438 --> 00:14:07,896
She's not "that Mexican," Mom.
She's my Mexican.

242
00:14:08,008 --> 00:14:10,738
And she's Colombian or something.
Anyway, it's over.

243
00:14:10,844 --> 00:14:13,142
- You've got three days.
- Hey.

244
00:14:13,246 --> 00:14:16,545
If I can't find a horny immigrant by then,
I don't deserve to stay here.

245
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:20,916
Oh!

246
00:14:21,021 --> 00:14:23,319
<i>Back at the model home,
Michael was adjusting to...</i>

247
00:14:23,423 --> 00:14:26,324
<i>the absence ofhis son,
by enjoying the company ofhis brother.</i>

248
00:14:26,426 --> 00:14:28,326
You know, I'm in pretty good shape.

249
00:14:28,428 --> 00:14:31,397
You could be eating my dust
all day, slowpoke.

250
00:14:31,498 --> 00:14:34,058
<i>And Buster was starting
to give as good as he got.</i>

251
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:36,601
Yeah. And you might be eating...

252
00:14:41,975 --> 00:14:45,240
Well, let's hope it doesn't come to that.

253
00:14:45,345 --> 00:14:49,577
Hey, Tobias. How's my son doing?

254
00:14:49,683 --> 00:14:52,379
Oh, well, he didn't want to
rehearse today...

255
00:14:52,486 --> 00:14:55,614
but I do think I have a handle
on what he's going through.

256
00:14:55,722 --> 00:14:59,180
I wish I could say the same for Steve Holt.
I don't know what the hell her problem is.

257
00:14:59,292 --> 00:15:01,419
- Her?
- Oh, uh, I'm sorry.

258
00:15:01,528 --> 00:15:05,794
I say that because I switched the parts,
but, it's still...

259
00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:07,958
off.

260
00:15:08,068 --> 00:15:11,037
Perhaps if she dressed as a woman.

261
00:15:11,138 --> 00:15:15,632
- She?
- Oh, for the love of God. She's playing a woman.

262
00:15:19,146 --> 00:15:21,580
Look who's back.

263
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,719
- I'm exhausted.
- Neiman's again, huh?

264
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,017
I've been going to the thrift store,
but I'm going to find a way to keep that dress.

265
00:15:30,123 --> 00:15:33,092
Things didn't work out with Mom.

266
00:15:33,193 --> 00:15:36,651
It was utterly macabre.

267
00:15:37,831 --> 00:15:39,799
Zip me up.

268
00:15:42,602 --> 00:15:44,900
She always makes everything about her.

269
00:15:45,005 --> 00:15:47,667
She's the last person I ever want to
need something from.

270
00:15:47,774 --> 00:15:50,140
Well, she likes to be needed, just as
long as it doesn't cost her anything.

271
00:15:50,243 --> 00:15:53,076
It's like she gets off
on being withholding.

272
00:15:55,115 --> 00:15:57,015
- Whoa. Buster.
- Look who's got something to say.

273
00:15:59,352 --> 00:16:03,789
I'm Mom, and I wanna shoot down everything
you say so I feel good about myself.

274
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:07,348
Look who's ragging on the old lady.

275
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,655
- Hey, hey.
- Finally.

276
00:16:09,763 --> 00:16:13,164
'Cause I'm an uptight...

277
00:16:14,201 --> 00:16:16,931
<i>Buster!</i>

278
00:16:17,037 --> 00:16:19,028
You old horny slut!

279
00:16:22,142 --> 00:16:25,873
Well, no one's gonna top that.

280
00:16:28,148 --> 00:16:31,777
<i>And Tobias had found
the perfect wardrobe for his leading man.</i>

281
00:16:31,885 --> 00:16:36,345
<i>The red dress he discovered
in the attic crawl space.</i>

282
00:16:36,456 --> 00:16:38,549
<i>Assuming Michael had found and returned it...</i>

283
00:16:38,658 --> 00:16:42,059
<i>- Lindsay called her mother, hoping to
get money for a new one.
- What?</i>

284
00:16:42,162 --> 00:16:44,392
- Hi, Mama. It's Linds.
- Get a job.

285
00:16:44,497 --> 00:16:48,558
Look. Just hear me out. It's Maeby's dress.
It was stolen from her locker.

286
00:16:48,668 --> 00:16:52,900
They beat her up,
and, uh, took all her clothes.

287
00:16:53,006 --> 00:16:55,474
- Send her over. I'll take her shopping.
- Buster was right.

288
00:16:55,575 --> 00:16:57,475
You get off on being
withholding, don't you?

289
00:16:57,577 --> 00:17:00,205
- Buster said that?
- That's right.

290
00:17:00,313 --> 00:17:03,248
- My Buster?
- Not anymore, apparently.

291
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:06,478
<i>While Lucille
was missing her youngest son...</i>

292
00:17:06,586 --> 00:17:10,181
<i>- Michael was finally enjoying his company.
- Zip me up.</i>

293
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:13,157
<i>And while Buster did build a faster bike...</i>

294
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,421
<i>- Whoo!
- he neglected to build the brakes.</i>

295
00:17:15,528 --> 00:17:17,496
I'm flying!

296
00:17:17,597 --> 00:17:19,724
Buster?

297
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:22,131
<i>And George Michael had news for Maeby.</i>

298
00:17:22,235 --> 00:17:25,500
So, I quit the play.
I don't really like plays.

299
00:17:25,605 --> 00:17:28,233
Also, I think your dad thinks I'm gay.

300
00:17:28,341 --> 00:17:31,071
- Oh. He thinks everyone's gay.
- Do you wanna get a soda?

301
00:17:31,177 --> 00:17:34,704
I can't. I'm actually back in the play.
We're in the middle of dress rehearsal now.

302
00:17:34,814 --> 00:17:38,375
<i>- But I thought Steve had your part.
- Steve did have Maeby's part.</i>

303
00:17:38,485 --> 00:17:40,715
<i>And Tobias had given Maeby a new part.</i>

304
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,754
So you want me to play the man?

305
00:17:42,856 --> 00:17:46,019
Yes. Don't you see?
l-I cast the parts all wrong.

306
00:17:46,126 --> 00:17:48,253
<i>It was Daddy's fault.</i>

307
00:17:48,361 --> 00:17:51,853
And I still get to kiss Steve, right?

308
00:17:51,965 --> 00:17:56,527
It's gonna be a huge disaster.
I'll get you tickets.

309
00:17:56,636 --> 00:17:59,196
<i>And Michael tried to salvage
what was left of the day...</i>

310
00:17:59,306 --> 00:18:02,605
<i>- with what was left ofhis brother.
- I'm a little shaky, but...</i>

311
00:18:02,709 --> 00:18:04,210
- but we're here to work.
- Michael.

312
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:05,177
- but we're here to work.
- Michael.

313
00:18:05,278 --> 00:18:07,246
- Mom.
- What are you doing here?

314
00:18:07,347 --> 00:18:11,147
Oh. Hello, Buster.
Here's a candy bar.

315
00:18:11,251 --> 00:18:12,946
- Oh...
- No. I'm withholding it.

316
00:18:13,053 --> 00:18:17,752
Look at me getting off.
How dare you turn Buster against me.

317
00:18:17,857 --> 00:18:20,587
<i>- What are you talking about?
- I know what you've all been saying.</i>

318
00:18:20,694 --> 00:18:23,822
But I'm not going to let you destroy
my relationship with my son...

319
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:26,398
just because you don't have one
with yours right now.

320
00:18:26,499 --> 00:18:28,831
Wait a minute.
Me and my son are fine...

321
00:18:28,935 --> 00:18:31,165
and that is not what this is.

322
00:18:31,271 --> 00:18:33,466
Buster is a grown man.
He can make his own decisions.

323
00:18:33,573 --> 00:18:38,135
- Why don't you ask Buster what he wants.
- Michael. I wanna go with Mom.

324
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:47,343
- You said that she shoots you down.
- I was trying to fit in.

325
00:18:48,822 --> 00:18:51,347
You were flying today, buddy.

326
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:54,427
Yes, I was flying...

327
00:18:54,527 --> 00:18:57,121
but a little too close to the sun.

328
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:00,859
You let him go in the sun?
Get in the backseat. I'll be right out.

329
00:19:00,967 --> 00:19:06,633
Front seat, Mom. I sit in
the front seat now. Mmm?

330
00:19:10,677 --> 00:19:15,114
Let me tell you something, Michael.
You have to fight for your family.

331
00:19:15,215 --> 00:19:18,878
If you were smart, you'd grab your son
before he slips any further away.

332
00:19:18,985 --> 00:19:21,613
Well, I disagree, Mom.

333
00:19:21,721 --> 00:19:24,019
I'm not gonna control George Michael.

334
00:19:24,124 --> 00:19:26,422
I'm gonna let him
decide for himself what's best.

335
00:19:26,526 --> 00:19:28,994
Mm-hmm. Well, you better hope...

336
00:19:29,095 --> 00:19:33,054
that little bird decides to
fly back into your house.

337
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:34,997
Because they usually don't.

338
00:19:46,713 --> 00:19:48,681
So, uh, can we go now?

339
00:19:51,885 --> 00:19:53,785
Yeah.

340
00:19:56,356 --> 00:19:59,257
<i>And George Michael watched
as Maeby shared the kiss...</i>

341
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:02,920
<i>that should've been his with
a boy he almost had to kiss.</i>

342
00:20:08,168 --> 00:20:12,434
<i>But, to Maeby's surprise,
she did not enjoy kissing Steve Holt.</i>

343
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:14,336
You smell like my mom.

344
00:20:14,441 --> 00:20:17,877
<i>Michael returned to the model home
to find his son in the kitchen.</i>

345
00:20:17,977 --> 00:20:21,242
<i>- You're home.
- Yeah. I was waiting for you.</i>

346
00:20:21,347 --> 00:20:25,147
- I thought we could make some of these.
- Sure.

347
00:20:31,057 --> 00:20:35,118
I'm sorry about what I said at the school.
It was out of line.

348
00:20:35,228 --> 00:20:37,696
I shouldn't have poked my nose into your life.

349
00:20:37,797 --> 00:20:40,960
- My life?
- I know that you're growing up.

350
00:20:41,067 --> 00:20:44,525
Yeah, but, Dad, you're, like,
the most important part of my life.

351
00:20:46,139 --> 00:20:49,438
That's a little cornball.

352
00:20:49,542 --> 00:20:52,602
- I don't mind.
- I don't mind either, buddy.

353
00:20:55,181 --> 00:20:57,581
- Watch your...
- Mother of God!

354
00:20:57,684 --> 00:20:59,982
Oh! Every damn time!

355
00:21:00,086 --> 00:21:03,249
Oh! This is a big one. Oh!

356
00:21:03,356 --> 00:21:05,722
<i>On the next
Arrested Development.</i>

357
00:21:05,825 --> 00:21:08,191
<i>Tobias gets a review
ofhis Shakespeare play.</i>

358
00:21:08,294 --> 00:21:11,855
I didn't get into this business to please
sophomore Tracy Schwarzman, so...

359
00:21:11,965 --> 00:21:13,990
onward and upward!

360
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,126
On...

361
00:21:17,237 --> 00:21:20,502
Why, Tracy? Why?

362
00:21:20,607 --> 00:21:22,939
<i>And Buster is back
where he belongs.</i>

363
00:21:23,042 --> 00:21:26,443
<i>- Mom!
- What is it?</i>

364
00:21:26,546 --> 00:21:29,014
I can't get down.
