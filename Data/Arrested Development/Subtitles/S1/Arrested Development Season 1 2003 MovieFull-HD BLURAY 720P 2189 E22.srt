1
00:00:01,656 --> 00:00:04,489
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:04,592 --> 00:00:06,526
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:06,628 --> 00:00:08,892
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:14,202 --> 00:00:16,329
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

5
00:00:19,707 --> 00:00:22,267
<i>Low-carb diets
are sweeping the nation...</i>

6
00:00:22,377 --> 00:00:24,402
but some local businesses
are being left in the dust.

7
00:00:24,512 --> 00:00:26,946
- And the latest on Iraq...
- Hey, George Michael.

8
00:00:27,048 --> 00:00:30,108
They're gonna show that interview you did.
We're gonna watch it on Thursday, okay?

9
00:00:30,218 --> 00:00:32,516
<i>- I'll make some popcorn.
- Popcorn? Really? Cool.</i>

10
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:35,214
- Yeah, the hell with Atkins, huh?
- Oh. Yeah.

11
00:00:35,323 --> 00:00:37,689
Oh, why blow it now?
I'll fry up some bacon.

12
00:00:37,792 --> 00:00:40,420
Uh, Dad...

13
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,498
Buddy, you gotta
take it easy, okay?

14
00:00:44,599 --> 00:00:46,499
I'm showing this
as a model again.

15
00:00:46,601 --> 00:00:49,434
I don't want people to think
we've got shoddy workmanship.

16
00:00:51,706 --> 00:00:53,970
That might not
have been your fault.

17
00:00:54,075 --> 00:00:56,566
I know. Nothing works
in this house.

18
00:00:56,678 --> 00:00:58,873
- Tell me about it.
- Is that a shot at me?

19
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,608
<i>- Probably.
- Because for your information, I got a job.</i>

20
00:01:01,716 --> 00:01:04,776
- Really? What kind of job?
- Beads.

21
00:01:04,886 --> 00:01:08,049
- Bees?
- Beads.
- Beads?

22
00:01:08,156 --> 00:01:11,353
- Gob's not on board.
- Beads are very big right now.

23
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:14,155
Uh, anklets,
necklaces, you name it.

24
00:01:14,262 --> 00:01:17,060
- Bracelets?
- But I'll need some start-up money.

25
00:01:17,165 --> 00:01:19,497
I'm in. But we're
gonna need a lot.

26
00:01:19,601 --> 00:01:21,728
Beads aren't cheap.
Are beads cheap?

27
00:01:21,836 --> 00:01:23,929
Gob, shouldn't you
be in bed?

28
00:01:24,038 --> 00:01:26,063
Well, we got a meeting
with Dad's attorney today.

29
00:01:26,174 --> 00:01:28,074
He's gonna want me to
take a lie-detector test...

30
00:01:28,176 --> 00:01:30,906
to use as evidence
in Dad's trial, but, uh, I don't want to.

31
00:01:31,012 --> 00:01:33,480
What if they ask about a magic trick?
I just... I can't risk it.

32
00:01:33,581 --> 00:01:37,483
They're not gonna ask you anything.
They want me to take the polygraph test.

33
00:01:37,585 --> 00:01:39,746
But... I'm the oldest.

34
00:01:39,854 --> 00:01:42,345
- The matriarch, if you will.
- Sure. I will.

35
00:01:42,457 --> 00:01:46,416
Listen, I have to do this to help out Dad,
and you don't know anything about our business.

36
00:01:46,527 --> 00:01:50,623
<i>Gob, I'm not looking for a partner. And,
believe me, if I was, it would not be you.</i>

37
00:01:50,732 --> 00:01:53,030
Oh. Good.

38
00:01:53,134 --> 00:01:56,262
Well, I'll start my own business.
How hard can it be?

39
00:01:56,371 --> 00:01:58,464
Z-z-z-z-z!

40
00:01:58,573 --> 00:02:00,302
Bz-z-z-z-z-z!

41
00:02:00,408 --> 00:02:02,774
We'll see who
brings in more honey.

42
00:02:05,313 --> 00:02:07,679
- He's thinking about bees again.
- Oh.

43
00:02:07,782 --> 00:02:11,013
I'm not just gonna cut you a check so you can
throw it away on another failed business.

44
00:02:11,119 --> 00:02:13,485
Hey, "Mommy, What Will I
Look Like?" should have worked.

45
00:02:13,588 --> 00:02:16,648
<i>Lindsay had once started
a photo-enhancing service...</i>

46
00:02:16,758 --> 00:02:19,852
<i>which gave new parents a glimpse at
what their infants would look like...</i>

47
00:02:19,961 --> 00:02:21,986
<i>in half a century.</i>

48
00:02:22,096 --> 00:02:25,793
<i>Hey, you put an ugly kid in, you can't be
surprised when an ugly adult comes out.</i>

49
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:29,495
Look, I need to become self-reliant.
It's not gonna last with Tobias.

50
00:02:29,604 --> 00:02:33,472
He's completely oblivious.
He's got no idea how I'm feeling or thinking.

51
00:02:33,574 --> 00:02:37,476
- So there's no sex?
- I mean, how do you not have sex with me?

52
00:02:37,578 --> 00:02:40,240
It is a struggle.
I'll tell you what.

53
00:02:40,348 --> 00:02:42,248
I'll help you out,
but you gotta work.

54
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,818
Great. Before you know it,
I'll be in the red.

55
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:47,387
And you can take that
to the bank.

56
00:02:47,488 --> 00:02:49,479
I'm sure they'll
contact me first.

57
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,320
<i>And that's when Michael
got a call that made him wish...</i>

58
00:02:52,427 --> 00:02:54,657
<i>he hadn't promised
his sister the money.</i>

59
00:02:54,762 --> 00:02:56,662
Hello.

60
00:02:56,764 --> 00:02:59,198
Kitty?

61
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,861
<i>And later, the family waited for Michael
at the prison meeting room.</i>

62
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:06,030
- How do you make money from it?
- I don't know. Honey?

63
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,404
- Or just as gifts.
- Who'd want a bee as a gift?

64
00:03:08,509 --> 00:03:11,000
<i>While Buster and Annyong
waitedjust outside.</i>

65
00:03:11,112 --> 00:03:13,512
- Come on. Just let me have one bite.
- No.

66
00:03:13,614 --> 00:03:15,605
Mother said no carbohydrate for you
if you ever gonna...

67
00:03:15,717 --> 00:03:17,617
get girlfriend
that's not old lady.

68
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:20,313
- At least I can get a girlfriend.
- I can get a girlfriend before you.

69
00:03:20,421 --> 00:03:23,049
- Oh, we'll see about that.
- Why aren't you in there?

70
00:03:23,157 --> 00:03:25,853
Oh, I was just keeping
Annyong company.

71
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,054
Give me that bagel, you little...
Give it to me!

72
00:03:29,163 --> 00:03:32,223
Whoa! Our star witness!
Come here.

73
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:34,699
Good to see you. You know what?
Don't get too close to me.

74
00:03:34,802 --> 00:03:37,703
'Cause I've got an itch you can't believe.
I think something laid eggs on me.

75
00:03:37,805 --> 00:03:41,536
- Thanks for the heads-up.
- That's okay. We've got your polygraph
set for tomorrow.

76
00:03:41,642 --> 00:03:43,906
<i>- About that...
- I'll tell them, Michael.</i>

77
00:03:45,446 --> 00:03:48,813
I won't do it.
I'm afraid of what I might know.

78
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:50,907
You? No one wants you.
Does anyone want him?

79
00:03:51,018 --> 00:03:53,384
- Who would want him?
- They don't want you.

80
00:03:53,488 --> 00:03:56,286
- Good.
- I might not be the best witness either.

81
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:59,052
- I got a phone call from Kitty this morning.
- His secretary?

82
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,560
<i>- My secretary.
- She says that she's got some evidence...</i>

83
00:04:01,662 --> 00:04:04,392
and she's threatening to bring down
the company unless we meet her demands.

84
00:04:04,499 --> 00:04:06,399
<i>Oh, that is just great.</i>

85
00:04:06,501 --> 00:04:10,733
And now I'm expected to climb back
on top of Kitty and do my thing again.

86
00:04:10,838 --> 00:04:12,772
I mean, this family
runs into problems, it's...

87
00:04:12,874 --> 00:04:14,774
"Oh, let's have Gob
our way out of it."

88
00:04:14,876 --> 00:04:18,107
- What is the matter with you?
- It's me that she wants to meet with, Gob.

89
00:04:18,212 --> 00:04:20,612
Oh. Good.

90
00:04:20,715 --> 00:04:23,013
Now, what does she have, Dad?
I need to know.

91
00:04:23,117 --> 00:04:25,244
No, you can't know.
We got to keep you nice and clean, Michael.

92
00:04:25,353 --> 00:04:29,289
- Especially if you're going
to take that lie detector test.
- He is absolutely right.

93
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,722
<i>Find out what Kitty wants
andjust give it to her...</i>

94
00:04:31,826 --> 00:04:34,021
<i>but don't find out
what she knows.</i>

95
00:04:34,128 --> 00:04:37,359
Michael, you can
save this business.

96
00:04:37,465 --> 00:04:39,865
You are the only one
who can do it.

97
00:04:39,967 --> 00:04:43,528
<i>Yeah, besides me, right? But I kind of
got my hands full with these babies.</i>

98
00:04:43,638 --> 00:04:45,196
<i>- He's got bees!
- No bees!</i>

99
00:04:45,306 --> 00:04:47,240
<i>Get it!</i>

100
00:04:47,341 --> 00:04:49,673
They don't allow you
to have bees in here.

101
00:04:49,777 --> 00:04:52,268
<i>And business was slow
at the banana stand...</i>

102
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,439
<i>- when George Michael made a new friend.
- Hi.</i>

103
00:04:55,783 --> 00:04:58,684
- Hi.
- Are bananas high in carbohydrates?

104
00:04:58,786 --> 00:05:00,686
<i>Oh, you're
on Atkins too?</i>

105
00:05:00,788 --> 00:05:04,189
Uh, yeah. Actually, that's, um...
that's why I'm gonna be on... on TV.

106
00:05:04,292 --> 00:05:07,853
<i>- You are?
- I was interviewed for Hindsight, with John Beard.</i>

107
00:05:07,962 --> 00:05:11,227
I, uh, I gave them a joke,
but I don't know if they're gonna use it.

108
00:05:11,332 --> 00:05:14,199
You know, thanks to this diet craze,
the last time we had a customer...

109
00:05:14,302 --> 00:05:16,031
the banana stand
was still green.

110
00:05:16,137 --> 00:05:20,471
Lose it. No, lose the whole kid.
We'll just go with the Iraq piece.

111
00:05:20,575 --> 00:05:23,408
- That's so cool.
- I guess.

112
00:05:23,511 --> 00:05:25,911
<i>You wanna watch over at my house?</i>

113
00:05:26,013 --> 00:05:28,675
Yeah, l-I guess.

114
00:05:30,017 --> 00:05:32,815
<i>And Michael headed off to meet Kitty.</i>

115
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,820
<i>Their last meeting
had ended poorly.</i>

116
00:05:34,922 --> 00:05:37,356
Say good-bye
to your company, Michael.

117
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:39,653
- And say good-bye to these.
- No, no, no, no.

118
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,025
<i>So Michael was understandably
anxious about their reunion.</i>

119
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:45,325
Guess I do get to see them again, huh?

120
00:05:45,433 --> 00:05:49,335
Can we please have one conversation
that's not about my rack, Michael?

121
00:05:49,437 --> 00:05:51,735
- Yeah.
- Maybe a better question would be...

122
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:53,670
what evidence do I have
against you, because...

123
00:05:53,774 --> 00:05:55,674
No, no, no. I don't...
I don't wanna know.

124
00:05:55,776 --> 00:05:58,074
I just want to know
what you want.

125
00:05:58,179 --> 00:06:00,670
I'd like to be in charge
of the Bluth Company.

126
00:06:00,781 --> 00:06:04,012
Well, I want a hamburger and French fries,
but I can't have the bun or potatoes. Get real.

127
00:06:04,118 --> 00:06:07,610
I deserve it. Your father promised it
to me on the day he went to prison.

128
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:11,850
Sounds like something
that he would do.

129
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:15,759
<i>And if I can't be in charge, then I'm
going to have to tell the entire world...</i>

130
00:06:15,863 --> 00:06:18,593
that your father was
building houses overseas...

131
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:21,099
- without paying...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Stop, stop. Stop.

132
00:06:21,202 --> 00:06:25,036
Act... No. Finish. Finish.
Um, without paying what? Taxes?

133
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:28,700
Model houses, Michael.
Overseas.

134
00:06:28,809 --> 00:06:31,903
And he hid it...
from the U.S. government.

135
00:06:32,013 --> 00:06:34,538
That's it? That's what
my dad's been hiding... back taxes?

136
00:06:34,649 --> 00:06:37,447
And unless you plan
on paying them...

137
00:06:37,551 --> 00:06:40,952
your dad's gonna be
in prison for a long time.

138
00:06:41,055 --> 00:06:44,889
No, we'll pay them. Forget it. We'll just...
We'll mortgage the company if we have to.

139
00:06:44,992 --> 00:06:47,552
We found money for those.
We'll find money for taxes. Good to see ya.

140
00:06:47,662 --> 00:06:52,725
Yeah. If I was in charge,
that would have been my first move too.

141
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:55,358
<i>As Michael returned home,
George Michael was heading out...</i>

142
00:06:55,469 --> 00:06:57,960
<i>to meet the girl
from the banana stand.</i>

143
00:06:58,072 --> 00:07:00,472
Great news. The business
is gonna be okay.

144
00:07:00,574 --> 00:07:02,565
Yeah, I thought bananas
would be okay on the diet.

145
00:07:02,677 --> 00:07:05,077
No, l-I meant... Well...
You haven't been eating those, have you?

146
00:07:05,179 --> 00:07:08,671
- No. No. Not at all. Just some nuts.
- Good. Those are fine.

147
00:07:08,783 --> 00:07:11,616
What I meant was, I think we're gonna
be seeing Pop-Pop sooner than we thought.

148
00:07:11,719 --> 00:07:14,779
Huh?
Does that sound good?

149
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:18,256
- Do you hear that rattle?
- It is very worrisome.

150
00:07:18,359 --> 00:07:21,055
- Hey, what the hell are you doing?
- Great news, Michael.

151
00:07:21,162 --> 00:07:23,790
We're thinking of purchasing
a Bluth model home.

152
00:07:23,898 --> 00:07:26,594
<i>And let's check the oven.</i>

153
00:07:26,701 --> 00:07:28,601
Whoa! That doesn't
inspire confidence.

154
00:07:28,703 --> 00:07:31,638
Lindsay, the bead business
taking off, is it?

155
00:07:31,739 --> 00:07:34,674
Actually, I am the breadwinner, Michael,
as it turns out.

156
00:07:34,775 --> 00:07:36,800
I was walking
in a strange place today...

157
00:07:36,911 --> 00:07:39,175
<i>a place I'd never
set foot in before.</i>

158
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,044
<i>Tobias, walking down a street
he'd been down many times...</i>

159
00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:46,381
<i>saw a book he'd written
years earlier as a psychiatrist.</i>

160
00:07:46,487 --> 00:07:48,853
<i>The book, initially unsuccessful,
had suddenly caught fire...</i>

161
00:07:48,956 --> 00:07:53,188
<i>although, strangely,
only in the gay community.</i>

162
00:07:53,294 --> 00:07:56,821
The book is huge. And I have a bit
of money coming my way as a result.

163
00:07:56,931 --> 00:08:00,162
<i>So if you'll excuse me, I'm going to
go upstairs and run the shower.</i>

164
00:08:00,267 --> 00:08:02,462
<i>Let me know
if it's too loud in the kitchen.</i>

165
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:04,504
Okay, honey.

166
00:08:04,605 --> 00:08:07,802
So, your husband comes into some money,
and suddenly he's not so oblivious anymore, huh?

167
00:08:07,908 --> 00:08:10,206
Hey, now, this is not me
being shallow, Michael.

168
00:08:10,311 --> 00:08:12,836
He's written a self-help book
that's helping people.

169
00:08:12,947 --> 00:08:14,847
- That does take some insight.
- Listen.

170
00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:16,849
This better not mean
you're blowing off the bead store.

171
00:08:16,951 --> 00:08:20,717
Well, uh, seeing as though you brought it up,
maybe we should get out of this investment.

172
00:08:20,821 --> 00:08:23,483
- I mean, seriously, Michael... beads?
- I knew you'd do this.

173
00:08:23,591 --> 00:08:26,219
You work for three seconds,
and you find something easier and grab it.

174
00:08:26,327 --> 00:08:28,227
It's "Dip-A-Pet"
all over again.

175
00:08:28,329 --> 00:08:31,355
<i>Lindsay also had a brief foray
into what she had then hoped...</i>

176
00:08:31,465 --> 00:08:35,526
<i>- Come back here!
- would be the burgeoning fad
of custom pet coloring.</i>

177
00:08:35,636 --> 00:08:38,730
Well, that would've worked
if you'd sprung for a bigger sink.

178
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,330
George Michael,
our show's about to start.

179
00:08:41,442 --> 00:08:44,002
- He went out on his date.
- A date?

180
00:08:44,111 --> 00:08:47,103
<i>But we had plans to...
A date with who?</i>

181
00:08:47,214 --> 00:08:50,843
Some girl. I mean, she barely has a face.
You couldn't pick her out of a lineup of one.

182
00:08:50,951 --> 00:08:53,283
<i>But first, the palaces of Iraq.</i>

183
00:08:53,387 --> 00:08:56,550
Trisha, tell us about these new
mini-palaces of Saddam's you've discovered.

184
00:08:56,657 --> 00:08:59,683
Our troops have been living here
for the last few days...

185
00:08:59,794 --> 00:09:03,594
and, as you can tell,
they've made themselves right at home.

186
00:09:03,697 --> 00:09:07,531
Now, a lot of this damage
is just due to shoddy workmanship...

187
00:09:07,635 --> 00:09:10,433
but the real surprise here
is that these homes...

188
00:09:10,538 --> 00:09:13,871
appear to be American-built
to begin with.

189
00:09:13,974 --> 00:09:15,908
There have been sanctions
against doing business...

190
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:18,137
with Hussein's regime
since the early '90s...

191
00:09:18,245 --> 00:09:21,408
<i>- so who built them?
- Does that look a little like our kitchen island?</i>

192
00:09:21,515 --> 00:09:24,882
Well, whoever it is,
they're in a world of trouble.

193
00:09:24,985 --> 00:09:27,112
<i>Michael realized
that his father's crimes...</i>

194
00:09:27,221 --> 00:09:29,086
<i>might be bigger
than he thought.</i>

195
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:33,991
There's a good chance
I may have committed some light treason.

196
00:09:34,095 --> 00:09:38,088
This might even be
considered light treason.

197
00:09:38,199 --> 00:09:40,793
Oh, my God.

198
00:09:46,871 --> 00:09:51,341
<i>Michael had just found out
his father might have committed...</i>

199
00:09:51,443 --> 00:09:54,435
<i>some light treason
by building model homes in Iraq.</i>

200
00:09:54,546 --> 00:09:57,674
<i>And he tried to get ahold of Kitty,
who he knew had the evidence.</i>

201
00:09:57,782 --> 00:10:00,444
<i>Unfortunately,
Kitty was meeting with Gob at the time.</i>

202
00:10:00,552 --> 00:10:04,283
- What about hash browns?
- No, because hash browns are potatoes.

203
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:06,789
So you really can't
eat anything on this diet.

204
00:10:06,891 --> 00:10:09,985
Wow. Wonder how this
is gonna affect my honey business?

205
00:10:10,095 --> 00:10:12,495
Gob, I have seen you
get passed over...

206
00:10:12,597 --> 00:10:14,895
time and time again
by your family.

207
00:10:14,999 --> 00:10:17,263
You don't deserve that.
You're smarter than them.

208
00:10:17,368 --> 00:10:22,101
What about macaroni...
let me finish... salad?

209
00:10:22,207 --> 00:10:24,698
Gob, this is your time.

210
00:10:24,809 --> 00:10:27,710
With my help,
knowing what I know...

211
00:10:27,812 --> 00:10:31,942
- we could take over the Bluth Company together.
- Wow!

212
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:34,484
This is a side of you
I'd never noticed before.

213
00:10:34,586 --> 00:10:38,113
Have they always
been that big?

214
00:10:38,223 --> 00:10:40,316
<i>And the next day,
Michael went to his mother's.</i>

215
00:10:40,425 --> 00:10:43,451
I saw an exposé
on the Iraq palaces last night...

216
00:10:43,561 --> 00:10:46,121
and I could have sworn that one of them
was the Sea Wind unit.

217
00:10:46,231 --> 00:10:50,793
That's funny. I always pictured Iraq
in the middle of the desert.

218
00:10:50,902 --> 00:10:52,563
Dad sold houses to the Iraqis,
didn't he?

219
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:55,195
And this is what you kept from me
so I could take the polygraph test.

220
00:10:55,306 --> 00:10:58,469
Tell me the truth, okay? 'Cause there's been
a lot of lying in this family.

221
00:10:58,576 --> 00:11:00,567
And a lot of love.

222
00:11:00,678 --> 00:11:03,203
- More lies.
- Look, I never knew about anything.

223
00:11:03,314 --> 00:11:05,612
But I had my suspicions.

224
00:11:05,717 --> 00:11:07,617
He never told me
where he was going...

225
00:11:07,719 --> 00:11:11,314
but he used to come back from those
business trips reeking of lamb.

226
00:11:11,422 --> 00:11:14,289
<i>And people would send figs...
not even at Christmas.</i>

227
00:11:14,392 --> 00:11:16,758
In the middle of October.

228
00:11:16,861 --> 00:11:19,091
Oh, and once,
someone sent him a toe...

229
00:11:19,197 --> 00:11:21,290
and he went white
as a sheet.

230
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:24,493
I think you're right, Michael.

231
00:11:24,602 --> 00:11:28,003
<i>Zero hour, Michael.
It's the end of the line.</i>

232
00:11:28,106 --> 00:11:31,735
I'm the first born.
Sick of playing second fiddle.

233
00:11:31,843 --> 00:11:35,108
Always third in line for everything.
Tired of finishing fourth.

234
00:11:35,213 --> 00:11:37,681
Being the fifth wheel.

235
00:11:37,782 --> 00:11:40,216
There are six things
I'm mad about...

236
00:11:40,318 --> 00:11:43,185
- and I'm taking over.
- You want to be in charge?

237
00:11:43,288 --> 00:11:45,449
- Yeah.
- You want to deal with what I deal with...

238
00:11:45,557 --> 00:11:48,924
a sister who takes your money
and throws it away;

239
00:11:49,027 --> 00:11:50,927
a mother
who you can't trust;

240
00:11:51,029 --> 00:11:54,157
a company whose founder
may be on trial for treason...

241
00:11:54,265 --> 00:11:56,529
Is that what you want?

242
00:11:56,634 --> 00:12:01,071
- What kind of vacation time does it offer?
- Yeah.

243
00:12:01,172 --> 00:12:05,541
<i>Gob realized that the power play
he promised to make with Kitty...</i>

244
00:12:05,643 --> 00:12:08,703
<i>- had perhaps come at a bad time.
- I've made a huge mistake.</i>

245
00:12:08,813 --> 00:12:10,248
<i>And Tobias was having
his first book reading.</i>

246
00:12:10,248 --> 00:12:11,146
<i>And Tobias was having
his first book reading.</i>

247
00:12:11,249 --> 00:12:14,776
And, for the ease of the reader, I have
changed all the gender-related pronouns...

248
00:12:14,886 --> 00:12:17,787
"he," "she"...
to the masculine "he."

249
00:12:17,889 --> 00:12:22,189
<i>"The Man Inside Me.
For Lindsay, my rock.</i>

250
00:12:22,293 --> 00:12:24,784
I could not have done this
without him."

251
00:12:26,331 --> 00:12:29,061
<i>And Lindsay arrived
to support her husband.</i>

252
00:12:29,167 --> 00:12:33,627
"For there is a man inside me,
and only when he's finally out...

253
00:12:33,738 --> 00:12:37,139
can I walk free of pain."

254
00:12:37,242 --> 00:12:39,676
This book is gonna sell,
like, a billion copies.

255
00:12:39,777 --> 00:12:42,905
<i>Lindsay!
Oh, I'm so glad you came.</i>

256
00:12:43,014 --> 00:12:44,948
I was hoping for more women.

257
00:12:45,049 --> 00:12:47,415
Perhaps I shouldn't have just used "he."
I think that was a mistake.

258
00:12:47,518 --> 00:12:51,682
<i>And Lindsay realized that Tobias was just
as oblivious as she'd always thought.</i>

259
00:12:51,789 --> 00:12:54,314
Tobias, I don't think
this relationship is gonna work.

260
00:12:54,425 --> 00:12:57,451
What are you talking about?
We've had some great times.

261
00:12:59,664 --> 00:13:02,599
We've got nothing left,
Tobias.

262
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,066
<i>And Michael went
to confront his father.</i>

263
00:13:05,169 --> 00:13:08,764
You're building houses in Iraq? I mean,
do you know how they punish treason?

264
00:13:08,873 --> 00:13:11,103
- First time.
- I've never heard of a second.

265
00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:13,803
Oh, I've got the worst...
attorneys.

266
00:13:13,911 --> 00:13:16,937
This is why I didn't want to get you
involved, but we can fix this.

267
00:13:17,048 --> 00:13:19,141
- What are Kitty's demands? What does she want?
- She wants my job.

268
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,218
Suddenly everybody wants my job,
and I should've given it to her.

269
00:13:21,319 --> 00:13:25,619
You mean, you didn't? Michael! She has
the evidence of what we did over there.

270
00:13:25,723 --> 00:13:28,214
No, all she thinks it is
is unpaid taxes.

271
00:13:28,326 --> 00:13:31,159
Yeah. What if she gives it to someone
who's even moderately intelligent?

272
00:13:31,262 --> 00:13:34,322
<i>In fact, Kitty had gone
to someone moderately intelligent...</i>

273
00:13:34,432 --> 00:13:37,492
<i>in her continuing quest for
control of the Bluth Company.</i>

274
00:13:37,602 --> 00:13:41,333
- I can't believe you called me for a date.
- You didn't tell anyone, did you?

275
00:13:41,439 --> 00:13:44,374
Are you kidding?
I don't need to brag...

276
00:13:44,475 --> 00:13:47,069
<i>that some people haven't
even been on a date!</i>

277
00:13:47,178 --> 00:13:49,578
Day not over yet, fatty.

278
00:13:49,681 --> 00:13:52,047
<i>You weren't thinking clearly.
I mean, none of us are.</i>

279
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:54,050
We need bread.

280
00:13:54,152 --> 00:13:56,643
If this information was so damaging,
why didn't you just shred it?

281
00:13:56,754 --> 00:13:59,154
Well, Saddam
owed us money.

282
00:13:59,257 --> 00:14:02,055
You didn't realize
that he wouldn't pay?

283
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,185
Your mom had a good
feeling about him.

284
00:14:04,295 --> 00:14:09,699
<i>So Mom knew this entire time, and shejust
lied to my face for months and months?</i>

285
00:14:09,801 --> 00:14:13,532
Let me tell you something, Dad. This is...
This is your problem. Okay? Not mine.

286
00:14:13,638 --> 00:14:17,734
Well, maybe it wouldn't be my problem
if you did what I asked for once in your life...

287
00:14:17,842 --> 00:14:20,970
- and you gave Kitty what I asked you to!
- Once in my damn life?

288
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:24,071
All I've ever done my entire life is do
exactly what you told me to, all right?

289
00:14:24,182 --> 00:14:28,175
I've done everything for this family, Pop.
Not anymore. Kitty can have my job.

290
00:14:28,286 --> 00:14:30,846
And you can take your own
polygraph test, 'cause I'm done.

291
00:14:30,955 --> 00:14:34,049
<i>- I'm done with you,
and I'm done with the business.
- Great.</i>

292
00:14:34,158 --> 00:14:38,458
I'm gonna get a lethal injection
because my son won't eat a potato.

293
00:14:41,167 --> 00:14:43,829
<i>George Sr., in a surprise move...</i>

294
00:14:43,936 --> 00:14:46,097
<i>volunteered to take
the polygraph.</i>

295
00:14:46,205 --> 00:14:48,230
- So did you swipe the sedative
from the infirmary...
- No!

296
00:14:48,341 --> 00:14:50,571
- to lower your heart rate?
- No! It's okay. I want to do this...

297
00:14:50,677 --> 00:14:54,010
because I want people to know
I never willfully deceived anyone.

298
00:14:54,113 --> 00:14:57,207
Mistakes were made,
but I never intended to hurt anyone!

299
00:14:57,317 --> 00:14:58,875
<i>I was trying to support
my family!</i>

300
00:14:58,985 --> 00:15:01,215
- He doesn't appear to be on a sedative.
- But I can see clearly now...

301
00:15:01,321 --> 00:15:05,917
sitting in this chair, strapped to this machine,
I can see that my life has become a failure!

302
00:15:06,025 --> 00:15:09,358
<i>I've let people down,
let myself down.</i>

303
00:15:09,462 --> 00:15:13,091
But I love my country!
I love it here!

304
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,861
You can shop... I love my...
Can't breathe.

305
00:15:15,968 --> 00:15:19,699
- I can't breathe!
- Wait! Wait! Are you guilty? Yes or no?

306
00:15:19,806 --> 00:15:22,468
<i>- I think he's having a heart attack.
- That was not a nod. No.</i>

307
00:15:22,575 --> 00:15:25,567
- That was not a nod.
- Call an ambulance!

308
00:15:29,148 --> 00:15:32,413
- Oh, how is he?
- Stable.

309
00:15:32,518 --> 00:15:35,715
But they don't know
if he's due for another one.

310
00:15:35,822 --> 00:15:39,952
It's his own fault. What kind of diet is this?
It's too much meat.

311
00:15:40,059 --> 00:15:43,153
I want all of you
off this immediately.

312
00:15:43,262 --> 00:15:45,992
Except you.

313
00:15:46,099 --> 00:15:48,761
<i>Tobias!
I can't believe you came!</i>

314
00:15:48,868 --> 00:15:51,894
Oh, come on, Lindsay.
This is my family.

315
00:15:52,004 --> 00:15:55,735
<i>And Lindsay realized that
perhaps they did have something left...</i>

316
00:15:55,842 --> 00:15:57,400
<i>a real connection.</i>

317
00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:00,070
Also, Dale, one of the gentlemen
from my reading...

318
00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:03,012
is a nurse here, so we were able
to park right out front.

319
00:16:04,884 --> 00:16:06,784
Oh! Barry.
Did you talk to a doctor?

320
00:16:06,886 --> 00:16:09,582
I did.
I have poison oak.

321
00:16:09,689 --> 00:16:12,419
Do you believe it?
Where the hell did I get that?

322
00:16:14,527 --> 00:16:17,257
- She was talking about George.
- No, he's the same.

323
00:16:17,363 --> 00:16:21,265
Look, I guess we should decide who's
gonna speak for the family. I would...

324
00:16:21,367 --> 00:16:22,925
but I have Laker tickets.

325
00:16:25,037 --> 00:16:26,937
<i>Buster knew this was his chance...</i>

326
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:28,973
<i>to put Kitty's coup d'état
in action.</i>

327
00:16:29,075 --> 00:16:31,373
<i>He wondered
ifhe was up for it.</i>

328
00:16:31,477 --> 00:16:33,945
Someone might have to sign
the "do not resuscitate" form.

329
00:16:34,046 --> 00:16:38,107
<i>- And he decided he wasn't.
- I need to make a telephone call.
Get out of something.</i>

330
00:16:38,217 --> 00:16:40,310
I'm in charge now.

331
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,615
I speak for this family.

332
00:16:42,722 --> 00:16:46,317
<i>I mean, l-I could,
if you wanted me to.</i>

333
00:16:46,426 --> 00:16:50,123
I'd rather not, obviously.
Don't know what I'd say.

334
00:16:50,229 --> 00:16:52,789
Why do I have to be the one?
I don't need this.

335
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:55,163
<i>Why does this have to
become my problem? No. I'm out.</i>

336
00:16:55,268 --> 00:16:57,395
Forget it. Find somebody else.
I'm sick of it.

337
00:16:57,503 --> 00:17:01,132
- I'm sick of doing everything for this family.
- Where is Michael?

338
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,470
- Typical.
- Did somebody call him?

339
00:17:03,576 --> 00:17:05,567
<i>In fact, they hadn't.</i>

340
00:17:05,678 --> 00:17:08,306
<i>And at that moment,
he was determined to finally get...</i>

341
00:17:08,414 --> 00:17:10,644
<i>- as far away from his family as possible.
- Hey, pal.</i>

342
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,980
- Pack your bags.
- Where are we goin'?

343
00:17:13,085 --> 00:17:16,179
Anywhere. Joshua Tree, space camp,
the Baseball Hall of Fame...

344
00:17:16,289 --> 00:17:19,816
Everything you and I have always wanted to do
but haven't been able to because of this family.

345
00:17:19,926 --> 00:17:22,656
- We're just gonna go?
- Yeah. And I don't know
if we're even gonna come back.

346
00:17:22,762 --> 00:17:25,322
- There's nothing keeping us here.
- Well, Dad...

347
00:17:25,431 --> 00:17:28,867
- I like it here.
- What the hell's going on with you lately?

348
00:17:28,968 --> 00:17:32,131
<i>I wanted to watch Hindsight,
and you weren't there.</i>

349
00:17:32,238 --> 00:17:35,173
I want to pack up and desert the family,
and you don't want to.

350
00:17:35,274 --> 00:17:38,209
- Is it this new girlfriend?
- No, it...

351
00:17:38,311 --> 00:17:41,940
It's because of the family.
I like the family.

352
00:17:42,048 --> 00:17:45,779
- I mean, if we leave, who's
gonna take care of these people?
- I don't know.

353
00:17:45,885 --> 00:17:50,185
The state or the police. Maybe the
Magicians' Alliance will pick up some slack.

354
00:17:50,289 --> 00:17:53,224
Hey. That's gonna be them, and
they're gonna want something.

355
00:17:53,326 --> 00:17:55,453
We're not answering that.

356
00:18:02,502 --> 00:18:04,402
Hello?

357
00:18:05,638 --> 00:18:08,630
- Where's George Michael?
- Exactly. Where is he?

358
00:18:08,741 --> 00:18:12,040
Ever since he's been dating this
Annie McNo-face, he's been blowing me off.

359
00:18:12,144 --> 00:18:14,374
- Oh, hey. Where's Pop-Pop?
- Room 212.

360
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,048
<i>And that's when Maeby decided...</i>

361
00:18:16,048 --> 00:18:16,946
<i>And that's when Maeby decided...</i>

362
00:18:17,049 --> 00:18:21,110
<i>that perhaps she could use her uncle
to make her cousin jealous.</i>

363
00:18:24,123 --> 00:18:26,387
Hey, Dad.
Wait up.

364
00:18:26,492 --> 00:18:29,154
That was a waste
of time.

365
00:18:31,097 --> 00:18:33,793
How's he doin'?

366
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,061
He's hanging in there.

367
00:18:36,168 --> 00:18:38,568
<i>He keeps trying to get this I. V.
out ofhis arm. I don't understand why.</i>

368
00:18:38,671 --> 00:18:40,571
<i>It's just glucose.</i>

369
00:18:40,673 --> 00:18:43,073
We're all trying
to stay away from sugar.

370
00:18:44,911 --> 00:18:48,608
- He's gonna be okay, right?
- Absolutely. Absolutely. You all right?

371
00:18:48,714 --> 00:18:51,046
I'll handle
this one, Michael.

372
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:55,951
Don't you worry. It'll take a lot more
than a heart attack to kill that old bear.

373
00:18:56,055 --> 00:18:57,955
Old bear!

374
00:18:58,057 --> 00:18:59,957
He likes the honey!

375
00:19:02,228 --> 00:19:04,594
He never got a chance
to see my bee business take off.

376
00:19:04,697 --> 00:19:08,224
Hey, come on, now. Dad's gonna be
around another 30 years, Gob.

377
00:19:08,334 --> 00:19:10,825
Your business,
uh, might not.

378
00:19:12,371 --> 00:19:14,635
You're a good brother,
Michael.

379
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:18,699
Heart attack never stop
old Big Bear.

380
00:19:18,811 --> 00:19:21,803
I didn't even know
we were calling him Big Bear.

381
00:19:21,914 --> 00:19:25,782
- We never had a chance to!
- Hey, hey. Come on, Gob.

382
00:19:25,885 --> 00:19:30,322
Everybody, I'm very sorry, okay?
I feel awful. I should have been here.

383
00:19:30,423 --> 00:19:33,688
I was the one that was supposed to take that
polygraph test, and then I just turned on him...

384
00:19:33,793 --> 00:19:35,784
<i>and then this happened,
but never again, okay?</i>

385
00:19:35,895 --> 00:19:39,296
I will never, ever leave this family,
no matter what.

386
00:19:40,766 --> 00:19:44,463
- You should've been here.
- I feel like I covered that.

387
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:47,505
- Well, you didn't say it.
- I feel awful. I should have been here.

388
00:19:47,607 --> 00:19:50,235
Maybe you're right. Maybe I didn't
say it. I should have been here.

389
00:19:52,478 --> 00:19:55,743
- Excuse me, Mr. Bluth.
- Hmm?

390
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:59,643
We lost him.

391
00:19:59,752 --> 00:20:03,210
He just, uh, got away from us.
I'm sorry.

392
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:06,685
<i>Uh, can we go in there?</i>

393
00:20:06,792 --> 00:20:09,260
If you want.
Not a lot to see.

394
00:20:09,362 --> 00:20:12,354
Maybe not for you,
but for us.

395
00:20:27,146 --> 00:20:31,776
<i>And that's when the family
realized that George Sr. wasn't dead...</i>

396
00:20:31,884 --> 00:20:34,944
<i>but was fleeing the country
that he loved so very much.</i>

397
00:20:41,794 --> 00:20:44,729
Pack your bags.

398
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:47,594
<i>On the next season
of Arrested Development.</i>

399
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,328
<i>The family grapples with the news
they hadjust heard.</i>

400
00:20:50,436 --> 00:20:52,904
Why would a doctor say he's "gone"
when he means he's escaped?

401
00:20:53,005 --> 00:20:55,030
God, I've missed bread.
Mmm.

402
00:20:55,141 --> 00:20:58,304
<i>Wouldn't you say,
"He left out the window'...</i>

403
00:20:58,411 --> 00:21:00,379
or, "The room's empty."

404
00:21:00,479 --> 00:21:02,379
<i>Maeby's life gets
a little more complicated.</i>

405
00:21:02,481 --> 00:21:05,917
It's so obvious. He gave himself the shot
to make it look like a heart attack.

406
00:21:06,018 --> 00:21:08,350
- How could they not see that?
- Maybe we should kiss again...

407
00:21:08,454 --> 00:21:11,890
and teach them a lesson
about obvious.

408
00:21:11,991 --> 00:21:13,788
<i>And Kitty helps George Sr.
escape.</i>
