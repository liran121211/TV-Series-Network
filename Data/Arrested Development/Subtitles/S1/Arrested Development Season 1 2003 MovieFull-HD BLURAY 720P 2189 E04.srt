1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:04,561
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:04,663 --> 00:00:06,654
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:06,765 --> 00:00:08,756
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:14,273 --> 00:00:15,934
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

5
00:00:18,677 --> 00:00:22,044
<i>Michael Bluth
was visiting his father in prison...</i>

6
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:24,843
<i>anxious to get to the bottom
of some mysterious bookkeeping.</i>

7
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,884
It just doesn't make
any sense, Dad.

8
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:30,045
Where did this money come from? Why did
it end up in the international accounts file?

9
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:33,454
<i>George Sr. was also anxious,
but less about the bookkeeping.</i>

10
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:36,585
This game is never gonna happen.
Half of these guys are still in their cuffs.

11
00:00:36,695 --> 00:00:38,856
I hate to be a buzzkill,
but I'm trying to get you out of here.

12
00:00:38,964 --> 00:00:42,627
Well, I'm trying to get us out of last place,
Michael. We're playing Rahway next week.

13
00:00:42,734 --> 00:00:45,635
Word has it that
they're getting Jose Canseco.

14
00:00:45,737 --> 00:00:48,535
I'm starting to wonder
why I even bother coming.

15
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,369
<i>- Bluth! Right field!
- That is ridiculous.</i>

16
00:00:50,476 --> 00:00:53,775
- You won't even talk to me!
- I'm catcher, or I'm nothing!

17
00:00:55,214 --> 00:00:57,239
<i>Michael returned to work...</i>

18
00:00:57,349 --> 00:01:00,546
<i>where his assistant, Kitty,
greeted him with some startling news.</i>

19
00:01:00,652 --> 00:01:02,449
Your wife's on line one.

20
00:01:02,554 --> 00:01:05,455
<i>Michael's wife
had been dead for two years.
- My what?</i>

21
00:01:05,557 --> 00:01:08,458
<i>- Kitty realized her mistake.
- I said, your wife is on line one.</i>

22
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,721
<i>But not immediately.</i>

23
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:12,763
Oh! Oh, God.

24
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:16,062
I'm sorry.
George's wife. Your mother.

25
00:01:16,168 --> 00:01:19,069
I'm so used to being
George's assistant.

26
00:01:19,171 --> 00:01:22,231
<i>Kitty had been George Sr.'s
fiercely loyal assistant for years.</i>

27
00:01:27,179 --> 00:01:30,580
<i>And Michael suspected that
she had the information he needed.</i>

28
00:01:30,682 --> 00:01:33,742
Hey, Kitty, listen,
you wouldn't know...

29
00:01:33,852 --> 00:01:36,582
if we had any documentation on
these international accounts, would you?

30
00:01:36,688 --> 00:01:39,953
That's actually not
any of your business.

31
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:43,152
<i>My business.
That's not any of my business.</i>

32
00:01:45,097 --> 00:01:47,429
Hey, Mom.

33
00:01:47,533 --> 00:01:50,434
Are you aware we've been downgraded
to being just pool members at the club now?

34
00:01:50,536 --> 00:01:53,266
Yeah, it's a real shame
what's going on with this family.

35
00:01:53,372 --> 00:01:56,830
You're stuck by the pool,
and Dad's getting picked last for softball.

36
00:01:56,942 --> 00:02:00,434
Nonetheless, you can free up a little company
money to get back our golf privileges.

37
00:02:00,546 --> 00:02:02,810
No, I can't.
Mom, you don't even play golf.

38
00:02:02,915 --> 00:02:06,316
No, but I use the clubhouse dining room...
until I was turned away today.

39
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:08,818
It's embarrassing... Take it back!

40
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:13,085
If I wanted something your thumb touched,
I'd eat the inside of your ear!

41
00:02:14,726 --> 00:02:17,126
You should see
the looks I'm getting.

42
00:02:17,229 --> 00:02:20,630
If you can't free up the cash,
have your father call the club president.

43
00:02:20,732 --> 00:02:24,133
I've got news for you, Mom...
I'm not visiting Dad in jail anymore.

44
00:02:24,236 --> 00:02:26,295
No, I've had it.

45
00:02:26,405 --> 00:02:29,670
I'm down there every single day trying to do
what I can to get this company back on track...

46
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:32,073
and he barely even acknowledges me.

47
00:02:32,177 --> 00:02:34,077
That is disgusting!

48
00:02:34,179 --> 00:02:38,138
Talk to your father.
I will not stand for this!

49
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:42,511
Gob!

50
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:46,216
Can I, uh... get you
to stop doing that?

51
00:02:46,325 --> 00:02:48,225
I'm just setting up an office.

52
00:02:48,327 --> 00:02:52,559
Gotta write a strongly worded letter
to one Warden James Buck.

53
00:02:52,664 --> 00:02:55,565
<i>In order to restore
his career as an escape artist...</i>

54
00:02:55,667 --> 00:02:58,761
<i>Gob had recently checked into prison
as a publicity stunt.</i>

55
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:02,670
- You really think you can
break out of my prison?
- You won't even know I was here.

56
00:03:02,774 --> 00:03:04,742
<i>But after a shiv to his side...</i>

57
00:03:04,843 --> 00:03:07,073
<i>Gob was rushed
to a local hospital...</i>

58
00:03:07,179 --> 00:03:11,115
<i>- thus fulfilling, in Gob's mind,
his contract with the public.
-? Ta-dah?</i>

59
00:03:11,216 --> 00:03:15,016
<i>And yet the warden had refused to
acknowledge the legitimacy of the escape.</i>

60
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,079
So I am going after this guy
with everything I've got...

61
00:03:19,191 --> 00:03:21,091
art.

62
00:03:21,193 --> 00:03:23,718
Now we are writing a letter.

63
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:26,263
<i>Gob?</i>

64
00:03:26,365 --> 00:03:30,233
<i>I wish I would've known
you were coming. I am a mess.</i>

65
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,303
Don't know if a call from me
would've changed that.

66
00:03:32,404 --> 00:03:34,736
Do you like my outfit?

67
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,434
Not as much as I like
what's underneath it.

68
00:03:37,542 --> 00:03:39,442
Gob!

69
00:03:39,544 --> 00:03:42,980
No, I need your chair. Get up.
I've got a letter to write.

70
00:03:43,081 --> 00:03:44,981
Whoo!
You're all business.

71
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:47,551
just like your dad.

72
00:03:47,653 --> 00:03:50,520
My God, she's repulsive.

73
00:03:50,622 --> 00:03:54,251
<i>Michael realized
that Kitty's obvious attraction to Gob...</i>

74
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,259
<i>could perhaps be of use to him.</i>

75
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,226
How would you like
a touch lamp?

76
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:00,230
You're the one
who needs therapy!

77
00:04:00,332 --> 00:04:03,597
<i>Meanwhile, Lindsay and Tobias prepared
for their first session with a therapist.</i>

78
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:06,102
Yes, Tobias,
I want the marriage to work.

79
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,604
I just don't know
if therapy is the answer.

80
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:11,733
Because you didn't respect my old career,
and you certainly don't respect my new one!

81
00:04:11,843 --> 00:04:13,743
<i>You don't have a new one!</i>

82
00:04:13,845 --> 00:04:17,440
<i>Things had been tense
since Tobias left his psychiatry practice...</i>

83
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,779
<i>to pursue an acting career.</i>

84
00:04:21,753 --> 00:04:24,722
- I have needs, you know.
- And how I am not addressing your needs?

85
00:04:24,823 --> 00:04:28,919
- How can you even ask that? What is this?
- Oh! Go right to that!

86
00:04:29,027 --> 00:04:32,087
Good. Go right there.
Real mature. Really great.

87
00:04:32,197 --> 00:04:36,930
Okay, kids, Mommy and Daddy
are going out for ice cream.

88
00:04:37,035 --> 00:04:40,994
- Can we come?
- Sorry. It's not for kids.

89
00:04:44,042 --> 00:04:46,272
<i>- Now we have to follow them.
- Yeah.</i>

90
00:04:46,378 --> 00:04:49,108
What?

91
00:04:49,214 --> 00:04:52,377
Okay, so, why are we doing this?

92
00:04:52,484 --> 00:04:55,351
'Cause it's obvious they're lying.
Come on, drive!

93
00:04:55,454 --> 00:04:58,446
- Well, what if they see us?
- How are they gonna see us?

94
00:04:58,557 --> 00:05:00,821
It says "Bluth Company"
right on the side.

95
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:04,293
Plus, it's a stairway.
That's gonna catch the eye.

96
00:05:04,396 --> 00:05:06,694
<i>The airport stairway vehicle...</i>

97
00:05:06,798 --> 00:05:09,961
<i>was the last vestige
of the Bluths'former wealth.</i>

98
00:05:10,068 --> 00:05:13,731
<i>Also, that House of Pies
that went out ofbusiness.</i>

99
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:16,137
You are scared. I knew it.

100
00:05:16,241 --> 00:05:19,642
No, I'm not scared.
It's just that... I have plans later.

101
00:05:19,745 --> 00:05:21,645
l-I'm visiting Pop-Pop.

102
00:05:21,747 --> 00:05:23,806
You visit Pop-Pop?

103
00:05:23,915 --> 00:05:26,975
<i>In fact, he'd been terrified
of the very notion of prison...</i>

104
00:05:27,085 --> 00:05:30,111
<i>since, as a young boy,
he accidentally watched HBO's Oz...</i>

105
00:05:30,222 --> 00:05:32,952
<i>mistaking it for the classic
Judy Garland musical.</i>

106
00:05:33,058 --> 00:05:35,356
<i>- I'm an innocent man!
- Eat it, bitch!</i>

107
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,985
- Lots of times.
- What's it like?

108
00:05:38,096 --> 00:05:41,395
You know what you should do?
You should go get your mom's date book.

109
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,401
Oh, yeah. She must have written down
where they're going.

110
00:05:44,503 --> 00:05:47,700
- I still wanna hear about prison, okay?
- If you can handle it.

111
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:52,207
<i>Michael arrived home in a good mood.</i>

112
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,710
<i>With Gob getting
the information from Kitty...</i>

113
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:57,646
<i>he would no longer have to visit prison
and deal with his father.</i>

114
00:05:57,749 --> 00:06:00,274
<i>Hey, buddy!
Came home early.</i>

115
00:06:00,385 --> 00:06:02,853
Wanna do somethin'?
Anything. Anything at all.

116
00:06:02,954 --> 00:06:05,787
I wanna visit Pop-Pop in prison.

117
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:12,694
<i>Back at the office, Gob was
making progress with Michael's assistant.</i>

118
00:06:12,798 --> 00:06:16,962
Here's where we keep all of our...
heavyweight paper.

119
00:06:17,068 --> 00:06:19,798
Bet you can show me
where a lot of things are.

120
00:06:19,905 --> 00:06:25,241
What kind of things
are you... looking for?

121
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:28,073
What, uh...
What are you hiding?

122
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,705
Nothing you can't find.

123
00:06:30,816 --> 00:06:34,308
Wait a second. Wait, wait, wait.
Take off your glasses.

124
00:06:36,488 --> 00:06:38,388
Oh.

125
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:41,789
Wait, wait.
Let down your hair.

126
00:06:46,097 --> 00:06:50,158
No. Glasses on. Hair back up.
Let's just get that hair right back up.

127
00:06:50,268 --> 00:06:53,169
- Do you want me to turn all the lights off?
- Yes, yes, please.

128
00:06:53,271 --> 00:06:55,239
How's that? Is that better?

129
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,900
There's still light coming in
from under the door.

130
00:06:58,009 --> 00:07:00,239
<i>And Lindsay and Tobias
were, for the first time...</i>

131
00:07:00,345 --> 00:07:01,744
<i>addressing
their marital problems.</i>

132
00:07:01,847 --> 00:07:04,077
It's like we're face to face now...

133
00:07:04,182 --> 00:07:07,811
<i>like we're really
seeing this marriage and...</i>

134
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,217
I'm afraid it's a lie.

135
00:07:14,326 --> 00:07:18,763
<i>Bravo. If I gave a performance that good,
I'd have my own Alias type show.</i>

136
00:07:18,864 --> 00:07:23,426
Stop it. I am so sick of hearing
about acting, acting, acting!

137
00:07:23,535 --> 00:07:26,333
Okay, okay, look,
maybe we need a new approach.

138
00:07:26,438 --> 00:07:30,272
Um... let's try
some role playing.

139
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:32,775
Yes! All right.

140
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,479
<i>Michael headed back to the prison...</i>

141
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,981
<i>despite his earlier vow
never to return.</i>

142
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:42,110
<i>You always say family first.
I should see my grandpa, right?</i>

143
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:45,781
I'm not stopping you.
It's just, after this I'm not going back there.

144
00:07:45,891 --> 00:07:47,791
Why? Is it scary?

145
00:07:47,893 --> 00:07:49,793
Scary? No. No.

146
00:07:49,895 --> 00:07:53,126
It's the opposite of scary.
It's like a carnival.

147
00:07:53,231 --> 00:07:57,861
Without the half-person on the skateboard
that grabbed your knee to steady himself.

148
00:07:57,969 --> 00:08:02,167
<i>It's like a country club. All the guy does
is eat ice cream and play softball all day.</i>

149
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:07,041
<i>In fact, George Sr.'s
softball game had taken most of the day.</i>

150
00:08:07,145 --> 00:08:10,046
<i>It was the 14th inning,
and tensions were running a little high.</i>

151
00:08:10,148 --> 00:08:15,176
I'll give you a thousand bucks, you call
the next one a strike. My knees are killing me.

152
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:17,755
<i>No batter! No batter here!</i>

153
00:08:17,856 --> 00:08:21,485
- Strike three!
- Strike three, my ass!

154
00:08:21,593 --> 00:08:23,720
Ohh!

155
00:08:23,828 --> 00:08:26,319
Down in the yard!

156
00:08:26,431 --> 00:08:28,922
No batter.
No... No batter.

157
00:08:29,034 --> 00:08:31,002
No... Shh.

158
00:08:32,737 --> 00:08:35,638
<i>Okay, there he is.
Go on in there and surprise him.</i>

159
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,140
I'm gonna go get us
a few ice cream sandwiches.

160
00:08:38,243 --> 00:08:40,234
Go on. Go on.

161
00:08:43,081 --> 00:08:45,072
Hey, Pop-Pop.

162
00:08:45,183 --> 00:08:48,846
- How's prison?
- I'm gonna die in here.

163
00:08:48,954 --> 00:08:51,047
What?

164
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:53,056
They're gonna kill Grandpa.

165
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:56,059
I gotta... I gotta get outta here.
I'm an innocent man.

166
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:59,619
You gotta help Pop-Pop get outta here.
Give me your hair.

167
00:08:59,731 --> 00:09:01,596
- My hair?
- Give Pop-Pop your hair!

168
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,602
- No touching! No touching! No touching!
- Give me the hair!

169
00:09:05,704 --> 00:09:09,868
One of these got smooshed,
but don't let that ruin prison for you.

170
00:09:09,975 --> 00:09:13,467
No batter.
No batter. No batter.

171
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:19,381
<i>Come on, baby!
Throw the ball!</i>

172
00:09:19,484 --> 00:09:22,385
I'm sure your grandfather was just kidding
around. You know his sense of humor.

173
00:09:22,487 --> 00:09:24,387
I know, I know. Yeah.

174
00:09:24,489 --> 00:09:27,947
I don't... I don't totally get the hair joke,
but I'm fine, Dad.

175
00:09:28,059 --> 00:09:30,050
Are you sure?

176
00:09:30,161 --> 00:09:34,393
I am gonna head back in, though. I'm gonna
see if Pop-Pop's got any more zingers.

177
00:09:34,499 --> 00:09:37,400
Just stay out here and relax, pal.

178
00:09:37,502 --> 00:09:40,471
Watch the softball game.
I'll be right back.

179
00:09:45,677 --> 00:09:47,975
<i>Hey, stop! Stop!</i>

180
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:55,148
Dad?

181
00:09:55,253 --> 00:09:57,153
just don't like prison anymore.

182
00:09:57,255 --> 00:10:00,156
That's why I'm trying
to get you out of here.

183
00:10:00,258 --> 00:10:03,352
Maybe I've been in denial,
but this place is breaking me, Mikey...

184
00:10:03,461 --> 00:10:05,656
and I'm alone here, but for you.

185
00:10:05,764 --> 00:10:08,164
Come on.
You got me, you got Mom.

186
00:10:08,266 --> 00:10:10,757
Your mother's never shown her face.

187
00:10:10,869 --> 00:10:12,769
Whoa.
She's never been here?

188
00:10:12,871 --> 00:10:15,840
You should've heard the grief she gave me
when I said I'd never show up again.

189
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,170
You said... You said what?

190
00:10:18,276 --> 00:10:21,768
Dad, you don't need me.
You're playing softball all the time.

191
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,178
<i>I do need you, Michael!</i>

192
00:10:24,282 --> 00:10:26,182
- No more softball.
- This is nuts.

193
00:10:26,284 --> 00:10:29,185
You're her husband. The least she could do
is come out and visit you.

194
00:10:29,287 --> 00:10:32,950
God, you know your mom. This isn't her crowd.
She's very easily threatened.

195
00:10:33,058 --> 00:10:34,958
You remember the carjacker?

196
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:41,964
- Aaah!
- Well, she's certainly toughened up since then.

197
00:10:42,067 --> 00:10:43,967
She's eating lunch by the pool now.

198
00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:46,902
There's a big difference between
the country club pool and the conjugal trailer.

199
00:10:47,005 --> 00:10:49,235
That's not what I meant
when I said "visit."

200
00:10:49,341 --> 00:10:51,741
It's too bad.
I really miss that personal contact.

201
00:10:51,843 --> 00:10:54,744
It was the one thing
that calmed me when I got stressed.

202
00:10:54,846 --> 00:10:58,213
It just felt... humanizing.

203
00:10:58,316 --> 00:11:00,216
<i>Michael, for the first time...</i>

204
00:11:00,318 --> 00:11:03,287
<i>saw his father
as a vulnerable human being.</i>

205
00:11:04,489 --> 00:11:07,151
Daddy horny, Michael.

206
00:11:09,427 --> 00:11:11,657
I just haven't had sex in a month.

207
00:11:12,997 --> 00:11:15,022
<i>You've been here two months.</i>

208
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:17,533
It's hard to gauge time.

209
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,432
Yeah, I'll bet.

210
00:11:19,537 --> 00:11:21,937
Hey, Mom. I went to visit Dad today.

211
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,941
Quick question. How long
does it take you to get out there?

212
00:11:25,043 --> 00:11:26,601
Oh, I've never been.

213
00:11:26,711 --> 00:11:29,009
Then why does he tell me
that you've never been?

214
00:11:29,114 --> 00:11:31,173
Ooh. Sorry, Michael.

215
00:11:31,282 --> 00:11:34,410
Pool food. My system's
not used to curly fries.

216
00:11:35,954 --> 00:11:37,854
How can you ignore that man?

217
00:11:37,956 --> 00:11:40,447
He's having a hard time in there.
He's lonely.

218
00:11:40,558 --> 00:11:42,458
That's what his children are for.

219
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,529
Yeah, well, you know...

220
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,791
there are certain things that...

221
00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:50,197
he can't get from his children.

222
00:11:50,301 --> 00:11:53,395
If you're going to say "pride," you're wrong.
He is proud of his children.

223
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:55,700
Wasn't gonna say pride, Mom.

224
00:11:55,807 --> 00:11:59,709
Uh, listen, l-l-I think that, um...

225
00:11:59,811 --> 00:12:02,371
I think that you should...

226
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,880
Oh, I can't believe
I'm gonna say this.

227
00:12:04,983 --> 00:12:06,883
I think that you should...

228
00:12:06,985 --> 00:12:08,885
visit him...

229
00:12:08,987 --> 00:12:12,047
in an... intimate...

230
00:12:12,157 --> 00:12:15,558
marital... trailer.

231
00:12:17,929 --> 00:12:19,920
Are you mad?

232
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:23,797
You think I'm comfortable asking you
to do this? He needs you, Mom.

233
00:12:23,902 --> 00:12:25,870
Did he say that?

234
00:12:27,138 --> 00:12:29,038
Did he say that he misses me?

235
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,074
Does he need his wife's embrace?

236
00:12:31,176 --> 00:12:33,076
Daddy horny, Michael.

237
00:12:33,178 --> 00:12:35,442
He said some wonderful things.

238
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:38,641
You really want this for him,
don't you?

239
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,183
I do.

240
00:12:40,285 --> 00:12:43,083
"Golf membership" want it?

241
00:12:44,956 --> 00:12:47,424
<i>Meanwhile, Lindsay and Tobias
were getting to the heart...</i>

242
00:12:47,525 --> 00:12:50,085
<i>of each other's vulnerabilities
with a role-reversal exercise.</i>

243
00:12:50,195 --> 00:12:51,992
- Because I'm a woman!
- Good.

244
00:12:52,096 --> 00:12:53,996
- With a woman's needs.
- Louder.

245
00:12:54,098 --> 00:12:56,760
<i>And a woman's urges!
And these, Tobias.</i>

246
00:12:56,868 --> 00:13:00,269
When was the last time
you looked at these?

247
00:13:00,371 --> 00:13:02,271
Yeah, okay.
How long is this session?

248
00:13:02,373 --> 00:13:05,274
See, she's breaking in and out of character
and making it difficult...

249
00:13:05,376 --> 00:13:07,276
'Cause I don't wanna be in a character.

250
00:13:07,378 --> 00:13:11,109
Okay, let me stop you guys.
All right? Please. Let me get in here.

251
00:13:11,216 --> 00:13:13,548
Thank you.
God.

252
00:13:15,653 --> 00:13:19,953
- You've never been a real wife to me, Lindsay.
- That's not true!

253
00:13:20,058 --> 00:13:23,824
A man is looking back at you.
A man with dreams and aspirations!

254
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:27,386
<i>Meanwhile, Maeby found an
address in her mother's appointment book...</i>

255
00:13:27,499 --> 00:13:31,128
<i>and was getting closer to learning
what her parents were up to.</i>

256
00:13:31,236 --> 00:13:36,868
Right! If I'm no Schwimmer,
you're noJennifer Aniston!

257
00:13:36,975 --> 00:13:40,502
<i>Maybe I'm not even Lisa Kudrow.</i>

258
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:42,978
l-I have dreams, Lindsay.

259
00:13:43,081 --> 00:13:45,549
Dreams, Lindsay.

260
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,752
Well, then, Tobias...

261
00:13:53,057 --> 00:13:54,991
follow those dreams.

262
00:13:55,093 --> 00:13:56,993
Make those dreams happen.

263
00:13:57,095 --> 00:13:59,825
Yes. I will.

264
00:13:59,931 --> 00:14:01,489
And scene!

265
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:06,429
- Wow!
- Okay.

266
00:14:06,538 --> 00:14:09,837
- I'm sorry I stepped on your line.
- No, not at all.

267
00:14:09,941 --> 00:14:13,342
- Did that answer some questions for you?
- Yeah, I think it did.

268
00:14:13,444 --> 00:14:15,844
Now there are two men
I wanna leave.

269
00:14:17,782 --> 00:14:21,183
<i>Michael arrived home, happy
to have a brother to share his burden with.</i>

270
00:14:21,286 --> 00:14:24,449
<i>- Great news.
- Oh, good. I could use it.</i>

271
00:14:24,556 --> 00:14:27,218
I just came from convincing Mom
to have sex with Dad.

272
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:30,852
God! What is wrong with you?
That is disgusting!

273
00:14:30,962 --> 00:14:33,089
- What's wrong with you?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

274
00:14:33,197 --> 00:14:36,826
But just the thought
of Mom and Dad together...

275
00:14:36,935 --> 00:14:39,096
I have a sense of propriety.
All right?

276
00:14:39,203 --> 00:14:41,103
Fine.
What's your great news?

277
00:14:41,205 --> 00:14:42,763
I Kitty.

278
00:14:42,874 --> 00:14:46,105
Oh, Gob, I just wanted you
to get the information.

279
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:49,077
Oh, I got the information.

280
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,240
You did, huh?
About the international accounts?

281
00:14:54,085 --> 00:14:56,986
I see what you're getting at.
No, I didn't get any information.

282
00:14:57,088 --> 00:15:00,216
That's great. Good, good, good, Gob.
You just lost the touch lamp.

283
00:15:00,325 --> 00:15:02,225
- What? No!
- The deal's off.

284
00:15:02,327 --> 00:15:05,728
I'm gonna use the touch lamp to
set the mood in the conjugal trailer
when Dad's nailing Mom!

285
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:07,627
No! Don't... Michael!

286
00:15:07,732 --> 00:15:09,563
<i>You are filthy!</i>

287
00:15:10,739 --> 00:15:12,570
<i>The two cousins reunited...</i>

288
00:15:12,674 --> 00:15:15,939
<i>each a little shaken by what they
had pretended to be fearless about.</i>

289
00:15:16,044 --> 00:15:18,308
<i>- You think they'll get divorced?
- I don't care.</i>

290
00:15:18,413 --> 00:15:21,814
I'm not saying "I don't care" like kids who say
they don't when they do... 'cause I don't.

291
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,884
Right. I know.
Who cares, right?

292
00:15:25,587 --> 00:15:27,919
<i>- I mean, I care.
- How could you not?</i>

293
00:15:28,023 --> 00:15:30,082
You know, our family's
really messed up.

294
00:15:30,191 --> 00:15:32,318
I know.
We're the only normal ones.

295
00:15:32,427 --> 00:15:35,260
At least we got
each other. Right?

296
00:15:43,872 --> 00:15:45,863
George Michael?

297
00:15:45,974 --> 00:15:47,874
Sorry.

298
00:15:47,976 --> 00:15:51,878
Sometimes I don't know if it's gonna be
a long or short hug or a middle-medium hug.

299
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,880
It's hard to tell sometimes.

300
00:15:53,982 --> 00:15:56,246
That was a good hug.
That's plenty for now.

301
00:15:56,351 --> 00:15:58,251
Hug's gotta end sometime, obviously.

302
00:15:58,353 --> 00:16:01,550
<i>Soon, Michael
was driving Lucille to prison...</i>

303
00:16:01,656 --> 00:16:04,352
<i>and she seemed to be
looking forward to it.</i>

304
00:16:04,459 --> 00:16:06,427
Where are we going after?

305
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:12,699
<i>- Hey, Dad.
- Michael!</i>

306
00:16:12,801 --> 00:16:15,065
What are you doing here?

307
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:18,697
You needed my help, and it was hard for you
to ask, so I took it upon myself to bring her.

308
00:16:18,807 --> 00:16:22,243
<i>- That doesn't make you uncomfortable?
- The drive was a little awkward.</i>

309
00:16:22,343 --> 00:16:25,904
Not every son
would do this for his father.

310
00:16:26,014 --> 00:16:27,982
Thank you for this.

311
00:16:32,787 --> 00:16:34,687
<i>Hello, George.</i>

312
00:16:34,789 --> 00:16:36,882
What the hell's
your mother doing in here?

313
00:16:36,991 --> 00:16:39,824
- Who were you expecting?
- Oh, I've done a bad thing.

314
00:16:39,928 --> 00:16:41,589
I've done a terrible thing.

315
00:16:41,696 --> 00:16:44,597
- There's someone else in
that trailer, isn't there?
- I've done a repulsive thing.

316
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:46,064
Wait... Whoa. It's Kitty?

317
00:16:47,502 --> 00:16:49,129
- Shh!
- How long?

318
00:16:49,237 --> 00:16:51,671
- When did this start?
- Oh, come on! This is the first time.

319
00:16:55,343 --> 00:16:57,834
Every Friday for the last eight years.

320
00:16:57,946 --> 00:16:59,743
- Daddy...
- Horny. I got that.

321
00:16:59,848 --> 00:17:02,749
Hey, wait a minute.
This is easy. This is an easy one.

322
00:17:02,851 --> 00:17:05,445
I'll go in there with Kitty,
I'll do my thing...

323
00:17:05,553 --> 00:17:09,250
and th-th-then I'll go and see your moth...
This is a hard one.

324
00:17:09,357 --> 00:17:11,325
- She's your secretary.
- You're right.

325
00:17:11,426 --> 00:17:13,451
Family first.

326
00:17:13,561 --> 00:17:15,791
Take care of Kitty.
Michael.

327
00:17:15,897 --> 00:17:17,865
I need you now.

328
00:17:17,966 --> 00:17:21,333
"International accounts" need me?

329
00:17:21,436 --> 00:17:23,336
<i>And so an agreement was made.</i>

330
00:17:23,438 --> 00:17:25,133
<i>George Sr.
would reveal the truth...</i>

331
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,607
<i>and Michael would make sure
Kitty didn't come out of the trailer.</i>

332
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,940
Yeah?

333
00:17:31,045 --> 00:17:33,138
I need you to come to the prison.

334
00:17:33,248 --> 00:17:35,682
- I'm at the prison.
- You're here?

335
00:17:35,784 --> 00:17:39,515
I'm delivering
this strongly worded letter I wrote...

336
00:17:39,621 --> 00:17:41,782
lit by nothing but natural light.

337
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:44,984
<i>Well, how would you like
that touch lamp and the office...</i>

338
00:17:45,093 --> 00:17:49,621
<i>and... what the hell...
full use of the secretary?</i>

339
00:17:51,399 --> 00:17:55,495
Thank you for doing this.
It means a... It means a lot.

340
00:17:55,603 --> 00:17:58,834
I, uh... Okay,
I'll get down on the couch.

341
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:02,307
I'm not going to have sex
with you, George.

342
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:05,709
I came to tell you how much I hate you
for what you've done to this family.

343
00:18:05,814 --> 00:18:08,146
- You're angry.
- You've ruined us.

344
00:18:08,249 --> 00:18:12,151
<i>I've ruined us?
You got a lot of nerve, honey.</i>

345
00:18:12,253 --> 00:18:15,711
The millions you pissed away on clothing
and jewelry and spa treatments...

346
00:18:15,824 --> 00:18:19,419
Yes, to keep you interested in the only thing
you ever appreciated... my body.

347
00:18:19,527 --> 00:18:21,654
Can I help it
if you've got a fantastic body?

348
00:18:21,763 --> 00:18:25,597
And you're as powerful as a bear.

349
00:18:26,801 --> 00:18:29,827
My husband the bear.

350
00:18:29,938 --> 00:18:32,270
This bear needs
some honey, wife.

351
00:18:32,373 --> 00:18:35,501
Oh, God, I missed you!

352
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:38,841
<i>Gob, meanwhile, stalled
to keep Kitty in the other trailer.</i>

353
00:18:38,947 --> 00:18:40,346
Glasses off.

354
00:18:40,448 --> 00:18:41,745
Glasses on.

355
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:43,681
Hair up.

356
00:18:43,785 --> 00:18:45,685
Glasses off.

357
00:18:45,787 --> 00:18:48,779
Down, on.
Have we done up, off?

358
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:51,085
<i>- Oh, Gob, this is so wrong.
- And bright.</i>

359
00:18:51,192 --> 00:18:54,093
Wrong a-and bright.

360
00:18:54,195 --> 00:18:56,186
This...

361
00:18:56,297 --> 00:18:58,697
That's be... brighter!

362
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,700
God! Damn.

363
00:19:00,802 --> 00:19:03,032
I'm just gonna wash up
real quick.

364
00:19:03,137 --> 00:19:06,231
Uh, I think I'm gonna go with...
with down and off.

365
00:19:06,341 --> 00:19:08,309
<i>Gob had to do the right thing.</i>

366
00:19:12,513 --> 00:19:15,539
<i>But as he headed to his car,
he ran into the warden...</i>

367
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:17,743
<i>who hadjust read
his strongly worded letter.</i>

368
00:19:17,852 --> 00:19:21,310
Well, if it isn't
"Sincerely Yours."

369
00:19:23,024 --> 00:19:26,152
<i>And so Gob was detained against
the window of the trailer...</i>

370
00:19:26,261 --> 00:19:28,126
<i>his parents were becoming intimate in.</i>

371
00:19:28,229 --> 00:19:31,062
Oh, God, Mommy! What did you do?

372
00:19:35,904 --> 00:19:38,964
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, where were you?

373
00:19:39,073 --> 00:19:41,598
I had to help out your grandfather...

374
00:19:41,709 --> 00:19:44,610
and then I had to vow that I would
never help your grandfather again.

375
00:19:44,712 --> 00:19:46,612
Pretty much a normal day for me.

376
00:19:46,714 --> 00:19:48,648
How are you doing?

377
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,241
I'm fine, I guess. It's just...

378
00:19:51,352 --> 00:19:56,255
You think of prison as this place full of guilty
people and it doesn't bother you that much.

379
00:19:56,357 --> 00:19:59,258
But if Pop-Pop could be there,
then anybody could be there.

380
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,352
And I don't wanna go to prison, Dad.
I don't think I could take it.

381
00:20:02,463 --> 00:20:04,363
I know I act tough, but l...

382
00:20:04,465 --> 00:20:06,126
Is this what you're worried about?

383
00:20:07,936 --> 00:20:09,836
'Cause I got news...

384
00:20:09,938 --> 00:20:12,168
he's, uh... he's guilty.

385
00:20:12,273 --> 00:20:14,468
He is?

386
00:20:14,575 --> 00:20:16,042
Oh, yeah.

387
00:20:17,145 --> 00:20:19,170
Incredibly guilty.

388
00:20:25,987 --> 00:20:28,285
<i>On the next
Arrested Development.</i>

389
00:20:28,389 --> 00:20:31,119
<i>Tobias talks Lindsay
into another session.</i>

390
00:20:31,225 --> 00:20:33,887
I've decided that...

391
00:20:33,995 --> 00:20:37,795
I want to become an actor too.

392
00:20:39,767 --> 00:20:42,759
<i>And George Sr. makes good...</i>

393
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:45,998
<i>on his promise to come clean
on the international accounts.</i>

394
00:20:46,107 --> 00:20:50,407
There's a good chance that l...
that I may...

395
00:20:50,511 --> 00:20:52,638
have committed some,
um...

396
00:20:52,747 --> 00:20:57,309
light...
treason.
