1
00:00:01,154 --> 00:00:04,555
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:04,658 --> 00:00:06,649
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,751
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:14,268 --> 00:00:15,929
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

5
00:00:18,171 --> 00:00:21,572
<i>Before going to work,
Michael decided to have a little fun.</i>

6
00:00:21,675 --> 00:00:25,509
I'm doing a little cost-projection
analysis for a mini-mall.

7
00:00:25,612 --> 00:00:28,103
Wow. That's pretty cool you
know how to do all that stuff.

8
00:00:28,215 --> 00:00:33,517
Yeah. Well, maybe your old man is just a little
bit cooler than you thought he was.

9
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:38,182
Stupid. Stupid chair.
Very stupid chair.

10
00:00:38,292 --> 00:00:41,955
But it's also this stupid
model home furniture.

11
00:00:42,062 --> 00:00:45,395
Maybe I oughta get myself one of those
nice leather chairs from work.

12
00:00:45,499 --> 00:00:49,560
- People can take chairs home from work?
- Well, not everybody.

13
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,138
But I'm the president of
the Bluth Company since Dad's in jail.

14
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,037
It's okay if I take a little
something from work, you know?

15
00:00:55,142 --> 00:00:58,634
Yeah, but isn't that why Grandpa's in jail,
because he took things from work?

16
00:00:58,745 --> 00:01:00,713
You're a good kid, you know that?

17
00:01:00,814 --> 00:01:04,944
I mean, a chair costs money,
so it's like stealing, and you always say...

18
00:01:05,052 --> 00:01:06,781
Not stealing. Not.

19
00:01:06,887 --> 00:01:11,449
I'm the one that taught you
stealing is bad, all right?

20
00:01:11,558 --> 00:01:14,857
I'm just saying, you know,
if I got a leather chair, okay?

21
00:01:14,962 --> 00:01:17,556
And I get to lean back...
Oh, this one's gonna go.

22
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:25,065
Leather chair? So, you're against stealing,
but skinning cows is cool with you.

23
00:01:25,172 --> 00:01:29,905
I'm fine, by the way. Frankly, your concern
is getting embarrassing.

24
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:32,979
- Since when are you against leather?
- You're not even a vegetarian.

25
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,446
<i>I'm not against the insides.
People need meat to survive.</i>

26
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:38,017
You are aware they don't remove it
from the cow surgically, right?

27
00:01:38,118 --> 00:01:42,248
Hi, Michael.

28
00:01:42,356 --> 00:01:45,985
Marta, hi. Hey, it's Marta.

29
00:01:46,093 --> 00:01:49,654
Hey, Marta, everybody.
Great to see you.

30
00:01:49,763 --> 00:01:52,823
- I was just looking for Gob.
- Well, you're his girlfriend.

31
00:01:52,933 --> 00:01:55,197
<i>Michael wished Marta
was his girlfriend.</i>

32
00:01:55,302 --> 00:01:57,600
<i>A secret he had only shared
with Lindsay.</i>

33
00:01:57,704 --> 00:02:00,901
Actually, we had a big fight.
He thought I was belittling his career...

34
00:02:01,008 --> 00:02:04,535
- but I never would do that.
- Neither would I. What career?

35
00:02:04,645 --> 00:02:07,773
- The magic?
- Oh, the tricks. The little tricks.

36
00:02:07,881 --> 00:02:11,510
- Those are great.
- Well, he didn't like my reaction to his new one.

37
00:02:11,618 --> 00:02:13,609
Real needle. Real apple.

38
00:02:15,322 --> 00:02:17,722
Real neck.

39
00:02:20,227 --> 00:02:24,129
ÉI es zombi!

40
00:02:24,231 --> 00:02:26,722
They're children!
How could you do that?

41
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:30,633
Oh, sure. First you dump all over it,
now you wanna know how it's done.

42
00:02:30,737 --> 00:02:33,365
- And I wanted to apologize.
- Well, he hasn't been here.

43
00:02:33,473 --> 00:02:37,375
But he said he was
staying here. Oh, my God.

44
00:02:37,477 --> 00:02:40,207
- Maybe he's staying with another woman.
- No, no, no. No, no.

45
00:02:40,313 --> 00:02:43,612
He is staying here.
I just haven't seen him here...

46
00:02:43,717 --> 00:02:45,878
the foyer or the kitchen.

47
00:02:45,986 --> 00:02:49,649
- Well, that's a relief.
- Yeah.

48
00:02:49,756 --> 00:02:53,419
- Well, tell him to call me when he gets in.
- I sure will, Marta.

49
00:02:53,527 --> 00:02:55,552
- If you remember.
- I will remember.

50
00:02:55,662 --> 00:02:58,460
Yeah. I'll give him
the message though. Okay.

51
00:02:58,565 --> 00:03:00,931
- She's gone.
- Yep. Got it.

52
00:03:01,034 --> 00:03:03,502
- You are too nice.
- Oh, come on. What was I supposed to do?

53
00:03:03,603 --> 00:03:07,061
Tell her that Gob is not staying here?
Tell her Gob is screwing around on her?

54
00:03:07,174 --> 00:03:10,666
God knows where he is?
Actually, that-that sounded okay.

55
00:03:10,777 --> 00:03:12,802
Nah, you'll never be able to do it.
You're too good.

56
00:03:12,913 --> 00:03:15,006
- You're the noble one.
- Thank you.

57
00:03:15,115 --> 00:03:17,015
- The one who never wins.
- l-I don't know about that.

58
00:03:17,117 --> 00:03:19,551
- The loser. The fool.
- Hmm?

59
00:03:21,855 --> 00:03:24,688
She is such a hypocrite.
Doesn't it drive you nuts?

60
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:27,783
- Crazy. Wait. Who is? Which part?
- My mom.

61
00:03:27,894 --> 00:03:30,362
She pretends to care
about all these causes.

62
00:03:30,464 --> 00:03:32,762
<i>Lindsay had always been celebrated...</i>

63
00:03:32,866 --> 00:03:36,802
<i>for her wine and cheese charity fund-raisers.</i>

64
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,800
I mean, now she's anti-leather? Let's see how
she feels when her daughter's pro-leather.

65
00:03:44,911 --> 00:03:48,210
Wanna go shopping with me?
I bet you could get something cool.

66
00:03:48,315 --> 00:03:51,614
<i>In fact, George Michael
had been trying to prove to Maeby...</i>

67
00:03:51,718 --> 00:03:54,846
<i>that he was macho, after
an embarrassing brush with her.</i>

68
00:03:54,955 --> 00:03:58,220
Your legs look exactly like mine,
and I just shaved mine.

69
00:03:59,926 --> 00:04:01,791
So I'm thinking of getting a motorcycle.

70
00:04:01,895 --> 00:04:05,888
I'm gonna need a leather jacket when I'm on
my hog and need to go into a controlled slide.

71
00:04:05,999 --> 00:04:11,460
There's my little girl. I've got great news.
Daddy has the entire day off.

72
00:04:11,571 --> 00:04:13,937
But you have every day off.
You don't have a job.

73
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,771
Well... I don't need money to hang
out with my daughter. Where are you going?

74
00:04:17,878 --> 00:04:20,403
- We're going shopping.
- Oh, no, no. I can't do that.

75
00:04:20,514 --> 00:04:23,972
<i>The next day, Michael
was stopped on his way to work.</i>

76
00:04:24,084 --> 00:04:25,847
<i>- Get in.
- What?</i>

77
00:04:25,952 --> 00:04:29,513
If you care about your brother,
you'll get in this car.

78
00:04:29,623 --> 00:04:33,286
- Which brother?
- Gob.

79
00:04:44,004 --> 00:04:45,904
Let me be clearer.

80
00:04:46,006 --> 00:04:50,102
Tell him Rollo wants him to
say good-bye to his legs.

81
00:05:02,722 --> 00:05:05,282
<i>- Michael went looking for Gob.
- Mom.</i>

82
00:05:05,391 --> 00:05:09,020
I'm so glad you're here. I want you to help
me break up your brother and his girlfriend.

83
00:05:09,128 --> 00:05:11,858
Well, I'm all for that.
We've just gotta find him first.

84
00:05:11,964 --> 00:05:15,127
- He's locked on the balcony.
- Oh.

85
00:05:15,234 --> 00:05:17,702
You meant Buster.
I thought you were talking about Gob.

86
00:05:17,803 --> 00:05:20,636
No. I will not have Buster
dating my best friend.

87
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,709
<i>Tension had been high
between the two Lucilles...</i>

88
00:05:23,809 --> 00:05:26,277
<i>since Buster had announced
he'd been dating her.</i>

89
00:05:26,378 --> 00:05:31,213
<i>Although neither had addressed this, both
had given indications of their true feelings.</i>

90
00:05:31,317 --> 00:05:34,946
- Mom, you're ruining our fort.
- I mean, she's been a family friend for years.

91
00:05:35,054 --> 00:05:37,648
It's just... creepy.

92
00:05:37,757 --> 00:05:41,158
Hi, buddy. Mom, I think
you might be overreacting.

93
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,524
She changed him as a baby.

94
00:05:43,629 --> 00:05:47,087
Okay. That-That's about
the creepiest thing I've ever heard.

95
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,326
That's why she didn't look surprised.

96
00:05:49,435 --> 00:05:53,166
You're the only child who chose a spouse
I liked, and she's the one who had to die.

97
00:05:53,272 --> 00:05:56,173
I know. That's rough for you.
Mom, I'm looking for Gob.

98
00:05:56,275 --> 00:05:59,802
There's some people after him, and I
don't know whether it's gambling or what...

99
00:05:59,912 --> 00:06:03,006
but, um, they wanna break his legs.

100
00:06:03,115 --> 00:06:05,515
It's a good thing he's already got
that little scooter.

101
00:06:05,618 --> 00:06:09,418
Oh, don't give me that look.

102
00:06:09,522 --> 00:06:11,956
I happen to be
a more caring mother than most.

103
00:06:12,057 --> 00:06:15,083
- Where's my bed?
- I put it in storage.

104
00:06:15,194 --> 00:06:18,960
I guess you'll just have to decide which
Lucille you want to spend your nights with.

105
00:06:19,064 --> 00:06:24,696
Okay. Before I leave this place
for the last time ever, has anyone seen Gob?

106
00:06:24,804 --> 00:06:28,968
I saw him last night
at the Playtime Pizza Theater. On my date.

107
00:06:29,074 --> 00:06:31,634
Of which I have
another one tonight.

108
00:06:31,744 --> 00:06:34,110
And I'm going to
continue dating, Mom.

109
00:06:34,213 --> 00:06:37,011
Sounds a little bit like "dating Mom."

110
00:06:37,116 --> 00:06:40,745
- It's starting to feel a little like it.
- Hmm.

111
00:06:40,853 --> 00:06:44,482
<i>Lucille decided she needed
the help of Buster's father.</i>

112
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:47,354
<i>Unfortunately,
after a recent escape attempt...</i>

113
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:50,587
<i>George Sr. had been
put in solitary confinement.</i>

114
00:07:17,857 --> 00:07:20,417
<i>Michael went to find
his brother at his latest gig.</i>

115
00:07:20,526 --> 00:07:22,858
- What's up, Mike?
- Yeah. What are you doing here?

116
00:07:22,962 --> 00:07:25,760
Can't get any work, Mike.
Magicians' Alliance has blackballed me...

117
00:07:25,865 --> 00:07:27,765
- from every venue in town.
- Hmm.

118
00:07:27,867 --> 00:07:29,926
Even my own so-called girlfriend
doesn't believe in me.

119
00:07:30,035 --> 00:07:32,663
Well, I don't wanna get into
that part of your life anymore.

120
00:07:32,771 --> 00:07:35,740
Okay. Listen, I just came here to tell you
that this guy named Rollo...

121
00:07:35,841 --> 00:07:37,775
pulled me over
and made some threats.

122
00:07:37,877 --> 00:07:40,345
- What kind of threats?
- He said to say good-bye to your legs.

123
00:07:40,446 --> 00:07:43,438
I don't know whether
this guy's a mobster, a loan shark...

124
00:07:43,549 --> 00:07:45,517
- something equally scary.
- A magician.

125
00:07:45,618 --> 00:07:49,884
I think you're confusing scary with silly.
This guy was frightening. He was in a limo.

126
00:07:49,989 --> 00:07:53,891
No, he's a magician.
He replaced me in the Alliance.

127
00:07:53,993 --> 00:07:56,223
<i>He's the reason I gotta
do my act in this hellhole.</i>

128
00:07:56,328 --> 00:07:58,796
- Why does he wanna break your legs?
- He doesn't wanna break my legs.

129
00:07:58,898 --> 00:08:01,298
- He wants to take my legs.
- l-I don't...

130
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,858
The legs... The bottom half of
my saw-the-lady-in-half trick.

131
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:07,131
No, not now. I'm showing him
how to do the trick.

132
00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:10,367
<i>Two chicks curl up in a box.
We call one the head and one the legs.</i>

133
00:08:10,476 --> 00:08:13,968
- So that's how they do it.
- God, I gotta stop giving these things away.

134
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,842
The top half there,
what do you do about that?

135
00:08:15,948 --> 00:08:18,576
- I just get a volunteer from the crowd.
- Oh, yeah?

136
00:08:18,684 --> 00:08:21,312
The old top half quit when she found out
I was sleeping with the legs.

137
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,184
I guess word
really gets around in there.

138
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:27,487
So Rollo wants your legs, but you're
cheating on Marta with those legs.

139
00:08:27,593 --> 00:08:29,993
Would you give me a break, please?
The legs are insanely jealous.

140
00:08:30,095 --> 00:08:34,191
Is that why you haven't seen Marta for the
past few days? This is about your love life.

141
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,825
I can't believe it. Just forget it.
I came here to try to help...

142
00:08:36,936 --> 00:08:41,532
- Hey, I appreciate your time.
- Great. Great.

143
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,608
You know what, Gob?

144
00:08:43,709 --> 00:08:47,611
Marta is a once-in-a-lifetime
woman. She's a treasure.

145
00:08:47,713 --> 00:08:49,908
And I don't think you're showing her
enough respect, okay?

146
00:08:50,015 --> 00:08:52,176
She doesn't respect my career.

147
00:08:54,887 --> 00:08:57,355
Okay.

148
00:08:57,456 --> 00:08:59,583
<i>He's having sex with a woman in his act?</i>

149
00:08:59,692 --> 00:09:02,183
I gotta tell Marta what's going on.

150
00:09:02,294 --> 00:09:05,559
First of all, she'll hate you for it.
It's called shoot the messenger.

151
00:09:05,664 --> 00:09:08,132
Secondly, it's not in your nature.
I mean, you're like Mr. Morals.

152
00:09:08,233 --> 00:09:10,463
- You can't even take a desk chair.
- Damn it.

153
00:09:10,569 --> 00:09:15,199
l-I'm a saint, you know? I'm a living saint,
and I get absolutely nothing out of it.

154
00:09:15,307 --> 00:09:18,037
Well, you get a false feeling
of superiority.

155
00:09:18,143 --> 00:09:20,703
I know. That is nice,
but this time, it's not enough.

156
00:09:20,813 --> 00:09:24,943
Why do I always have to be the one that
has to set the good example for everyone?

157
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:28,850
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, that's why.

158
00:09:31,156 --> 00:09:33,454
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, honey.

159
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:36,790
Moo?

160
00:09:36,895 --> 00:09:39,659
Mmm. Moo, honey.

161
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,628
You have to be some sort of
she hulk to get this.

162
00:09:43,736 --> 00:09:46,864
- You just gotta really dig.
- Well, it's not... enjoy...

163
00:09:46,972 --> 00:09:50,669
Oh, Maeby, great news.
I got my hands on some money.

164
00:09:50,776 --> 00:09:54,678
I can't say how or when...
or where my wedding ring is...

165
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:59,217
but, my purse overfloweth
as do my high spirits...

166
00:09:59,318 --> 00:10:02,776
- so a-shopping we must go.
- Dad, we already went.

167
00:10:02,888 --> 00:10:06,483
That's why we're wearing all this leather.
I'm really into leather.

168
00:10:06,592 --> 00:10:10,494
- Tell Mom.
- Yes.

169
00:10:10,596 --> 00:10:15,465
- If you ever need to borrow
any money or anything...
- No. Thank you, no.

170
00:10:15,567 --> 00:10:19,003
<i>So Tobias chose to pursue
a common interest with his daughter.</i>

171
00:10:19,104 --> 00:10:23,734
- May I help you?
- I hope so. Um, I'm looking
for something that says...

172
00:10:23,842 --> 00:10:27,835
- "Dad likes leather."
- Something that says, "leather daddy"?

173
00:10:27,946 --> 00:10:29,971
Oh, is there such a thing?

174
00:10:30,082 --> 00:10:32,550
<i>Later that day,
Michael got a surprise visit.</i>

175
00:10:32,651 --> 00:10:34,619
- Marta. What are you doing here?
- I was looking for Gob.

176
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,019
- He said he was working here today.
- Oh, yes? Please.

177
00:10:38,123 --> 00:10:42,355
He said that, huh?
Said that he's working, huh? Wow. Here?

178
00:10:42,461 --> 00:10:46,056
What else did he say? Did he tell you
I gave him your message?

179
00:10:46,165 --> 00:10:48,895
- Not that I'm the messenger, you know?
- He told me.

180
00:10:49,001 --> 00:10:52,027
I don't know what you said to him,
but it really turned him around.

181
00:10:52,137 --> 00:10:56,130
- He said I was a treasure.
- She's a treasure.

182
00:10:56,241 --> 00:10:59,870
<i>And a
once-in-a-lifetime woman.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

183
00:10:59,978 --> 00:11:04,312
Listen, Marta, Gob is...

184
00:11:06,819 --> 00:11:09,185
- a poet.
- Mm.

185
00:11:09,288 --> 00:11:12,416
He's touched. I'm gonna tell him
that you stopped by...

186
00:11:12,524 --> 00:11:15,652
- and, uh, you have a nice day.
- Thank you.

187
00:11:15,761 --> 00:11:19,094
You're such a good brother.
Always trying to help him.

188
00:11:19,198 --> 00:11:23,362
- He showed me the watch you gave him.
- The watch?

189
00:11:23,469 --> 00:11:25,767
I appreciate your time.

190
00:11:25,871 --> 00:11:29,500
<i>And so, for the first time,
Michael set a plan in motion...</i>

191
00:11:29,608 --> 00:11:31,735
<i>to take something
that didn't belong to him.</i>

192
00:11:31,844 --> 00:11:36,543
You know, I was thinking, I'd like to
help you guys out one more time.

193
00:11:36,648 --> 00:11:40,277
You know what you should do?
You should surprise Gob onstage.

194
00:11:40,385 --> 00:11:43,047
- I know that he's looking for a new assistant.
- Really?

195
00:11:43,155 --> 00:11:44,679
- Mm-hmm.
- Could you help me with that?

196
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:49,227
- Yes.
- You really are a good guy, Michael.

197
00:11:49,328 --> 00:11:54,356
Well, you can't change who you are.

198
00:12:07,413 --> 00:12:08,214
<i>Michael went to
the popular magic parlor...</i>

199
00:12:08,214 --> 00:12:09,977
<i>Michael went to
the popular magic parlor...</i>

200
00:12:10,082 --> 00:12:13,210
<i>the Gothic Castle, to ask a favor of Rollo.</i>

201
00:12:13,319 --> 00:12:18,723
I was wondering if, uh... if you would
give my brother a show?

202
00:12:18,824 --> 00:12:22,885
One more chance to get back in
with the Alliance. That's all I ask.

203
00:12:22,995 --> 00:12:25,259
<i>And-And you will get your legs back.</i>

204
00:12:25,364 --> 00:12:27,730
How?

205
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:30,768
You're asking me to reveal my trick?

206
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:33,236
<i>So Michael went to give
his brother the good news.</i>

207
00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:36,740
- Really, tomorrow night?
- Yeah. You just gotta make sure
you do the sawing in half trick.

208
00:12:36,842 --> 00:12:38,969
- I don't even have a top half.
- Don't worry about that.

209
00:12:39,078 --> 00:12:42,445
I got someone I want you to use. She's perfect.
A great girl. You're doing me a favor.

210
00:12:42,548 --> 00:12:46,484
- Has she got big cans?
- I'll see ya there, Gob.

211
00:12:46,585 --> 00:12:48,780
- You're a good brother.
- You're a horrible brother, Michael.

212
00:12:48,888 --> 00:12:51,015
Pretty good, huh?

213
00:12:51,123 --> 00:12:53,785
You're gonna put Marta
onstage with the legs?

214
00:12:53,893 --> 00:12:56,862
It's gonna blow up.
Legs get upset. Marta gets upset.

215
00:12:56,962 --> 00:12:59,430
Marta leaves Gob,
and I don't get shot.

216
00:12:59,532 --> 00:13:01,659
You'll never be able to
pull the trigger on this.

217
00:13:01,767 --> 00:13:04,600
- You can't escape it, Michael.
You're the good guy.
- Call me what you want.

218
00:13:04,703 --> 00:13:09,436
- An impotent man-boy?
- But it is done. The plan is in motion.

219
00:13:09,542 --> 00:13:14,707
- This just isn't you.
- It's me now. It's the me that can recline.

220
00:13:14,813 --> 00:13:18,112
- Did that hurt?
- No.

221
00:13:19,218 --> 00:13:21,846
This stuff's kind of hot, isn't it?

222
00:13:21,954 --> 00:13:25,082
- I hadn't noticed.
- Hey, gang.

223
00:13:25,191 --> 00:13:28,820
Mind if squeeze in here
for a moment? Oh!

224
00:13:28,928 --> 00:13:31,897
Look at us. Who'd wanna mess with
any of us, huh?

225
00:13:34,433 --> 00:13:37,061
- Excuse me.
- Yes. Oop.

226
00:13:39,471 --> 00:13:43,100
- Did you get a job or something?
- No. No, I didn't.

227
00:13:43,209 --> 00:13:47,475
Unless you consider
"World's Coolest Daddy" a job.

228
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:51,243
If l...

229
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:55,844
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, buddy. You're still wearing that jacket, huh?

230
00:13:55,955 --> 00:13:58,480
- Yeah. I was just going for a new look.
- Yeah?

231
00:13:58,591 --> 00:14:00,752
Trying to introduce
some edge to the whole palette.

232
00:14:00,859 --> 00:14:03,521
- Hmm. Kind of liked you the way you were.
- You did?

233
00:14:03,629 --> 00:14:05,722
Yeah. I mean, we can't really change
who we are anyway, right?

234
00:14:05,831 --> 00:14:09,392
Wish you'd told me that before
I threw away my Windbreaker.

235
00:14:09,501 --> 00:14:13,699
- Oh, you bought a chair.
- Uh, no, actually, I borrowed it.
Like we talked about.

236
00:14:13,806 --> 00:14:17,765
Well, I thought we decided
that was like stealing.

237
00:14:17,876 --> 00:14:20,071
Is that where we landed on that?

238
00:14:20,179 --> 00:14:21,908
<i>As Michael was becoming more selfish...</i>

239
00:14:22,014 --> 00:14:25,142
<i>his father was choosing
a more pious path.</i>

240
00:14:28,053 --> 00:14:32,285
<i>Which made Buster and Lucille's visit
go much differently than planned.</i>

241
00:14:32,391 --> 00:14:34,256
Why is there
a piece of shoe on your head?

242
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,319
This is a... Well, it's a reminder that
the divine presence...

243
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:40,295
is always above me.

244
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:45,359
Well, more importantly,
Buster's been humping the widow Austero.

245
00:14:45,471 --> 00:14:47,336
- Mom.
- Is that true?

246
00:14:47,439 --> 00:14:50,101
No. We're taking it slow.

247
00:14:50,209 --> 00:14:53,576
He stays there sometimes
until 7:00, 8:00 at night.

248
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:58,207
<i>Peanut brittle on his breath. Is she the one
who's going to take him to the dentist?</i>

249
00:14:58,317 --> 00:15:00,751
She already has.

250
00:15:08,594 --> 00:15:11,563
- What?
- "May you live. May you be well.
I give you my blessing."

251
00:15:11,664 --> 00:15:14,792
- Wow! Really?
- Are you out of your mind?

252
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,664
- Just follow the heart that God gave you, hmm?
- No touching.

253
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:21,900
No...

254
00:15:26,512 --> 00:15:29,310
Can you get me
some of that peanut brittle?

255
00:15:29,415 --> 00:15:33,511
<i>On the night of the show,
the family arrived at the Gothic Castle...</i>

256
00:15:33,619 --> 00:15:37,419
<i>and in the green room, Michael was
preparing Marta for the trick.</i>

257
00:15:37,523 --> 00:15:42,119
At the bottom of the box.
And you two guys are free to talk.

258
00:15:42,227 --> 00:15:43,990
Okay. Gob, Gob, Gob.

259
00:15:44,096 --> 00:15:46,030
What is going on?
Where's the top half?

260
00:15:46,131 --> 00:15:51,034
I have to teach her this trick.
She's gotta fold her knees.

261
00:15:51,136 --> 00:15:54,435
It's a fantastic trick. I don't want you
to worry though. I've already told her.

262
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,701
Now where are the legs?
Are they running late?

263
00:15:56,809 --> 00:16:00,040
- So is everyone here?
- I think so. I haven't seen Tobias.

264
00:16:00,145 --> 00:16:03,273
<i>In fact, Tobias
had intended to come...</i>

265
00:16:03,382 --> 00:16:06,613
<i>but had a slight miscommunication
with his cabdriver.</i>

266
00:16:06,719 --> 00:16:09,187
- Where to, mate?
- The Gothic Castle.

267
00:16:09,288 --> 00:16:12,883
- Gothic Asshole?
- That's what I said.

268
00:16:12,991 --> 00:16:15,789
<i>And ended up
in the wrong location.</i>

269
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:21,293
Oh, I am glad
I didn't go with that outfit.

270
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,494
Yes, hello. I am looking for the magic.

271
00:16:24,603 --> 00:16:27,163
<i>Danke schön.</i>

272
00:16:30,442 --> 00:16:33,240
Oh. Hello, Lucille.

273
00:16:33,345 --> 00:16:36,473
Hello, Lucille.
Having a good time with my son?

274
00:16:36,582 --> 00:16:41,212
- Actually, we're having a wonderful time.
- You know, he's damaged goods.

275
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,845
- He was born with a hole in his heart.
- Now listen to me, Lucille.

276
00:16:43,956 --> 00:16:47,517
- I'm gonna fill that hole, 'cause we're in love.
- Oh, please.

277
00:16:47,626 --> 00:16:49,423
You're no more in love
with him than I am.

278
00:16:49,528 --> 00:16:53,191
Okay. We're all saying some things
we're going to regret.

279
00:16:53,332 --> 00:16:55,823
<i>Meanwhile, Gob was
almost ready to begin his show.</i>

280
00:16:55,934 --> 00:16:58,903
Okay. It's magic time.

281
00:16:59,004 --> 00:17:01,404
- Hey, good luck out there now.
- Listen, I got you something...

282
00:17:01,507 --> 00:17:05,466
for being such a good guy...
not that it's a surprise, you always are.

283
00:17:05,577 --> 00:17:08,011
Oh, well, uh...

284
00:17:10,048 --> 00:17:12,539
- My watch.
- I want you to have it.

285
00:17:12,651 --> 00:17:15,449
Well, you've stolen so many things
from me over the years.

286
00:17:15,554 --> 00:17:18,182
This is the first time
you've ever given something back.

287
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:22,283
I wanna try to be a better brother,
like you are to me.

288
00:17:22,394 --> 00:17:24,692
<i>We're ready for you.</i>

289
00:17:26,565 --> 00:17:27,930
<i>Gob...</i>

290
00:17:28,033 --> 00:17:31,525
have a good show out there.

291
00:17:31,637 --> 00:17:36,199
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, a magician named Gob.</i>

292
00:17:54,993 --> 00:17:57,621
<i>- Dad?
- Hey, George Michael.</i>

293
00:17:57,729 --> 00:18:01,597
- Where's the leather jacket?
- It's like you said...
you can't change who you are.

294
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,329
So what? So I don't have
any hair on my arms or legs. So what?

295
00:18:05,437 --> 00:18:07,405
You know, a leather jacket's
not gonna change that.

296
00:18:07,506 --> 00:18:10,168
You know, I was trying to
act like a tough guy, and it's wrong.

297
00:18:10,275 --> 00:18:14,405
- I'm just a boring, old nice guy like you.
- I'm not that nice.

298
00:18:14,513 --> 00:18:16,981
Dad, if this is about
the chair... I've been thinking.

299
00:18:17,082 --> 00:18:20,176
You deserve it. You know, it's not like
you'd ever steal something big.

300
00:18:20,285 --> 00:18:23,743
<i>Michael was having
second thoughts about his plan.</i>

301
00:18:23,856 --> 00:18:25,915
<i>But then he got some unexpected help.</i>

302
00:18:26,024 --> 00:18:29,425
Hey, I'm sorry to interrupt. You'd better
tell Gob, the legs aren't coming.

303
00:18:29,528 --> 00:18:32,656
- Oh, my God.
- I can't believe the legs would screw him like this.

304
00:18:32,764 --> 00:18:36,632
This is his one last chance. They'll never
let him in the Alliance again.

305
00:18:36,735 --> 00:18:40,637
You have to do something.
This is so important to me and Gob.

306
00:18:42,674 --> 00:18:46,303
Where am I gonna get a pair of beautiful
women's legs on such short notice?

307
00:18:48,213 --> 00:18:50,579
<i>So, the trick went forward as planned.</i>

308
00:18:50,682 --> 00:18:55,278
And now, my, hopefully,
lovely assistant will join me.

309
00:19:13,071 --> 00:19:16,040
Wiggle those sexy gams, lady.

310
00:19:16,141 --> 00:19:18,735
I'm okay with myself.
I'm okay with myself.

311
00:19:26,285 --> 00:19:29,083
Mom, did you see it? I'm back in.

312
00:19:29,187 --> 00:19:32,486
I've got the career back.

313
00:19:32,591 --> 00:19:35,492
<i>- Thank you for coming.
- And when Lucille noticed...</i>

314
00:19:35,594 --> 00:19:41,226
<i>how happy Marta had made Gob, she realized
how important love was to her children.</i>

315
00:19:43,135 --> 00:19:45,365
- Mom.
- Hello, Buster.

316
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:48,337
If you're still mad,
I don't care. I'm in love.

317
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,773
I actually came to ask
Lucille something.

318
00:19:51,877 --> 00:19:53,936
<i>- What?
- I was wondering...</i>

319
00:19:54,046 --> 00:19:56,879
if you'd like to play bridge
with me next week?

320
00:20:00,285 --> 00:20:03,448
I'd absolutely adore it. Oh, Lucille.

321
00:20:03,555 --> 00:20:05,853
Oh, God. Look at us, Buster.

322
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:09,553
We're back together again.
Lucille and Lucille.

323
00:20:09,661 --> 00:20:12,960
You guys are friends again.
You can play bridge together.

324
00:20:15,634 --> 00:20:19,695
Could you just... just separate?

325
00:20:19,805 --> 00:20:24,538
<i>Michael watched as
the brother he swore to stop helping...</i>

326
00:20:24,643 --> 00:20:27,612
<i>enjoyed the girlfriend
he helped him reunite with.</i>

327
00:20:30,315 --> 00:20:35,116
<i>And so he returned to work, accepting
the fact that he was a good guy.</i>

328
00:20:36,588 --> 00:20:38,647
<i>But not as good as everyone thought.</i>

329
00:20:43,862 --> 00:20:45,762
This really worked better with the chair.

330
00:20:47,199 --> 00:20:48,962
<i>On the next Arrested Development.</i>

331
00:20:49,067 --> 00:20:51,627
<i>The Alliance decides to let Gob back in.</i>

332
00:20:51,737 --> 00:20:55,229
Tell me, how'd you get two Alliance-approved
assistants with such short notice?

333
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:59,401
That was just my girlfriend and my nephew.

334
00:20:59,511 --> 00:21:01,741
Well, you're out.

335
00:21:01,847 --> 00:21:05,305
<i>- And Tobias gets some good news.
- I got a gig.</i>
