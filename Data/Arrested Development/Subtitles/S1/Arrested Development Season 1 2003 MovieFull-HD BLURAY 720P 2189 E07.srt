1
00:00:01,422 --> 00:00:04,152
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:06,659
<i>and the one son who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:06,761 --> 00:00:08,752
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:15,930
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

5
00:00:18,773 --> 00:00:20,673
<i>Michael Bluth had called a meeting...</i>

6
00:00:20,775 --> 00:00:22,675
<i>with the family's longtime attorney...</i>

7
00:00:22,777 --> 00:00:25,007
<i>to discuss his father's incarceration.</i>

8
00:00:25,113 --> 00:00:29,777
I am so sorry.
It was a client. Okay.

9
00:00:29,884 --> 00:00:32,375
<i>But he was finding it difficult
to get any answers.</i>

10
00:00:32,487 --> 00:00:35,456
- How long was I on the phone?
- Twenty-five minutes.

11
00:00:35,557 --> 00:00:38,720
With the cell phone charges,
I'm gonna round it out to about an hour...

12
00:00:38,826 --> 00:00:41,556
'cause it's easier to bill...
all right.

13
00:00:41,663 --> 00:00:44,962
<i>- Anything else to go over?
- We've got everything else to go over.</i>

14
00:00:45,066 --> 00:00:48,524
We haven't done anything
to get my dad out of jail.

15
00:00:48,636 --> 00:00:53,505
Okay. First of all...
What are you doing? Pilates?

16
00:00:53,608 --> 00:00:57,044
Because no 40-year-old woman
should look like that.

17
00:00:57,145 --> 00:00:59,705
Well, no 40-year-old woman
does look like that.

18
00:00:59,814 --> 00:01:02,681
<i>He was, however,
getting along with his sister...</i>

19
00:01:02,784 --> 00:01:04,979
<i>which was unwelcome news
to their mother...</i>

20
00:01:05,086 --> 00:01:07,452
<i>who feared this unity
might be used against her.</i>

21
00:01:07,555 --> 00:01:09,455
<i>I do have some big news.</i>

22
00:01:09,557 --> 00:01:11,752
It's going to cost you a little money...
20,000, something like that.

23
00:01:11,859 --> 00:01:16,592
<i>The courts have agreed
to let your father out of prison.</i>

24
00:01:16,698 --> 00:01:18,598
- This is a lawyer!
- He's a master!

25
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,793
For the entire afternoon.

26
00:01:20,902 --> 00:01:23,393
What do you mean "afternoon"?
What afternoon?

27
00:01:23,504 --> 00:01:26,769
<i>The day before Christmas,
in time for the Living Classics Pageant...</i>

28
00:01:26,874 --> 00:01:29,069
because I know how important
that is to all of you.

29
00:01:29,177 --> 00:01:31,611
<i>The Living Classics Pageant,
an Orange County tradition...</i>

30
00:01:31,713 --> 00:01:35,274
<i>consists oflive representations
of classic works of art.</i>

31
00:01:35,383 --> 00:01:38,079
<i>The Bluth family has participated
not only as a patron...</i>

32
00:01:38,186 --> 00:01:41,349
<i>but as an integral part
of its most popular exhibit...</i>

33
00:01:41,456 --> 00:01:45,085
<i>Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam.</i>

34
00:01:45,193 --> 00:01:47,286
I don't really want to be Adam this year.

35
00:01:47,395 --> 00:01:49,727
Well, if you want to play Eve,
you got to get in line...

36
00:01:49,831 --> 00:01:52,322
behind, what, about five homos.

37
00:01:54,369 --> 00:01:57,361
That was wrong.
I'm... I'm so sorry.

38
00:01:57,472 --> 00:01:59,804
<i>It's just that I have one
down at the office now...</i>

39
00:01:59,907 --> 00:02:02,000
and, I mean, it is every day.

40
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:05,944
I would be happy to play Adam.
I'd prefer a speaking part...

41
00:02:06,047 --> 00:02:09,039
Please don't speak for the rest of the meeting.

42
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:12,119
- Zing!
- No, no, seriously. I don't want to play Adam.

43
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,654
Buster, every year we go through
this song and dance...

44
00:02:14,756 --> 00:02:19,318
and every year you say, "Thank you, Mama,
for making me play Adam."

45
00:02:19,427 --> 00:02:22,191
<i>- You're doing it.
- This concerned Buster...</i>

46
00:02:22,296 --> 00:02:24,628
<i>as he'd been secretly dating
his mother's best friend...</i>

47
00:02:24,732 --> 00:02:27,724
<i>and chief social rival,
Lucille Austero.</i>

48
00:02:27,835 --> 00:02:30,303
Can't we just stay here
and play poker again?

49
00:02:30,405 --> 00:02:32,839
You can bet your vertigo medicine
against my anxiety pills.

50
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,501
No. Buster, for God's sake,
there is music to hear...

51
00:02:36,611 --> 00:02:39,136
places to go, envy to stir.

52
00:02:39,247 --> 00:02:42,045
Look, I'm tired of
keeping our love a secret.

53
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,744
We are going out,
and that is that!

54
00:02:44,852 --> 00:02:47,753
- Oh.
- Oh, Buster. Okay, I'm okay.

55
00:02:47,855 --> 00:02:49,686
<i>I'm okay.</i>

56
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:51,691
Okay. I'm gonna get out of your hair.

57
00:02:51,793 --> 00:02:53,818
- We'll talk about this money later in the week.
- Excuse me.

58
00:02:53,928 --> 00:02:56,954
We're not going to pay $20,000
to get my Dad out for one day.

59
00:02:57,065 --> 00:03:00,432
No. It's a bond.
It's all refundable, unlike my time.

60
00:03:00,535 --> 00:03:02,503
It's been a complete waste
of two hours, okay?

61
00:03:02,603 --> 00:03:04,503
We're just not going to do it,
and that's that.

62
00:03:04,605 --> 00:03:07,768
- Are you writing two hours?
- No, I'm taking notes on the case.

63
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:09,775
- Let me just see what you just wrote.
- You're scaring me.

64
00:03:09,877 --> 00:03:14,405
just leave it alone! It is a gift from a client!
Ruining a good meeting.

65
00:03:14,515 --> 00:03:17,609
- Barry's very good.
- He's an idiot.

66
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:19,619
Exactly. We're not trying
to get Dad out for a night.

67
00:03:19,721 --> 00:03:21,621
We're trying
to get him out for good.

68
00:03:21,723 --> 00:03:24,214
We're gonna get a new lawyer.
I actually know of one who's available.

69
00:03:24,325 --> 00:03:26,225
His name's WayneJarvis.
He's a top guy.

70
00:03:26,327 --> 00:03:28,386
<i>WayneJarvis had become famous...</i>

71
00:03:28,496 --> 00:03:30,396
<i>after an employment
discrimination suit...</i>

72
00:03:30,498 --> 00:03:33,433
<i>against the family's current attorney,
Barry Zuckerkorn.</i>

73
00:03:33,534 --> 00:03:36,765
It'll be a long time before Barry Zuckerkorn
calls anyone a homo again.

74
00:03:36,871 --> 00:03:39,533
You know, I am really happy
that you two are in agreement...

75
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,767
but we're not getting rid of Barry.

76
00:03:41,876 --> 00:03:44,868
He's like family,
and you can't fire family.

77
00:03:44,979 --> 00:03:47,880
Yeah, I know.
Hey, Maeby.

78
00:03:47,982 --> 00:03:50,314
<i>Maeby, where have you been?</i>

79
00:03:50,418 --> 00:03:53,717
You left me at home.
You do remember you have a daughter, right?

80
00:03:53,821 --> 00:03:55,914
Uh, yes, of course we remember...

81
00:03:56,023 --> 00:03:57,923
and we were worried sick,
young lady.

82
00:03:58,025 --> 00:04:02,553
She's fine. Our daughter's all right,
everybody, so...

83
00:04:02,663 --> 00:04:05,655
<i>- You said you didn't want her to come.
- I said I didn't want you to come.</i>

84
00:04:05,767 --> 00:04:09,430
- Oh, that makes more sense.
- Now she's going to think
we're totally self-involved.

85
00:04:09,537 --> 00:04:12,734
I can fix this.
Buster's probably still in the lobby.

86
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,741
Let me go see if I can't get him
to give me the part of Adam.

87
00:04:15,843 --> 00:04:18,573
<i>And I'll see if I can get some money
from my mom.
- Lupe!</i>

88
00:04:18,679 --> 00:04:20,579
There are some juice glasses
on the sofa table.

89
00:04:20,681 --> 00:04:22,672
<i>Mama, I'll help you clean up.</i>

90
00:04:22,784 --> 00:04:24,581
There are some salad plates
on the piano.

91
00:04:24,685 --> 00:04:27,552
Wow. What a party.
You make it seem so effortless.

92
00:04:27,655 --> 00:04:29,646
What do you need money for?
A divorce?

93
00:04:29,757 --> 00:04:32,453
No, Mom. Tobias and I
are doing fine, thank you.

94
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,687
- It's my credit card debt.
- Forget it.

95
00:04:34,796 --> 00:04:36,593
Fine. I'll ask Michael.
He'll give it to me.

96
00:04:36,697 --> 00:04:40,098
Maybe if you get him drunk.
It's the only way he'll give money...

97
00:04:40,201 --> 00:04:43,102
to someone he calls
a "stay-in-bed mom."

98
00:04:43,204 --> 00:04:46,833
- He said that about me?
- I thought it was harsh.

99
00:04:46,941 --> 00:04:50,069
But, you know, he thinks
you're completely irresponsible.

100
00:04:50,178 --> 00:04:52,806
A stay-in-bed mom.

101
00:04:52,914 --> 00:04:56,179
Probably because you don't work,
and you're lazy.

102
00:04:56,284 --> 00:04:58,115
His words.

103
00:04:58,219 --> 00:05:00,619
<i>- I can't believe him.
- I know!</i>

104
00:05:00,721 --> 00:05:03,690
just when you were
getting along so well.

105
00:05:10,565 --> 00:05:12,556
They've got to be kidding me.

106
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,970
<i>Michael's brother Gob, meanwhile...</i>

107
00:05:18,072 --> 00:05:22,168
<i>had missed the meeting that morning
after being delayed by his girlfriend Marta.</i>

108
00:05:22,276 --> 00:05:24,972
<i>?: Te quiero!</i>

109
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:27,673
- English, please.
- I love you.

110
00:05:27,782 --> 00:05:29,875
Great. Now I'm late.

111
00:05:29,984 --> 00:05:32,316
<i>And while Gob
took his girlfriend for granted...</i>

112
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:35,082
<i>Michael was learning Spanish
to get closer to her.</i>

113
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:37,555
<i>That is not something I can bring to my boss.</i>

114
00:05:37,658 --> 00:05:42,027
<i>Unfortunately, the one tape
he could find was oflittle use to him.</i>

115
00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:44,029
<i>Are you going
to the complimentary breakfast?</i>

116
00:05:44,131 --> 00:05:46,429
That'll get her hot.

117
00:05:46,534 --> 00:05:49,503
Well, if it isn't the boy
who lives under the stairs.

118
00:05:49,604 --> 00:05:51,504
- Hey, Gob.
- What are you doing, learning Spanish?

119
00:05:51,606 --> 00:05:56,236
Nope. It's, uh... It's something for work,
so, yes, uh, yeah.

120
00:06:01,182 --> 00:06:02,717
<i>Meanwhile, Buster
was trying to get George Michael...</i>

121
00:06:02,717 --> 00:06:04,116
<i>Meanwhile, Buster
was trying to get George Michael...</i>

122
00:06:04,218 --> 00:06:06,686
<i>to take his place as Adam.</i>

123
00:06:06,787 --> 00:06:09,085
I don't know, Uncle Buster.

124
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,590
- Well, you don't have the "frontspiece" yet.
- "Frontspiece"?

125
00:06:11,692 --> 00:06:16,356
Look, I don't want to go through a whole song
and dance with you. You're going to love it.

126
00:06:16,464 --> 00:06:20,423
You just can't do anything that violates
the original painting, like giggling or itching.

127
00:06:20,534 --> 00:06:24,231
They do allow some nervous crying,
but you can tell they don't like it.

128
00:06:25,806 --> 00:06:28,434
<i>And Maeby was teaching
her parents a lesson for forgetting her...</i>

129
00:06:28,542 --> 00:06:31,102
Who knows how long I'll be gone?

130
00:06:31,212 --> 00:06:33,942
<i>when she spotted George Michael.</i>

131
00:06:34,048 --> 00:06:36,812
Nice pecs. Got a kickin' bod.

132
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:40,718
<i>Thus, George Michael found a compelling
reason to keep the muscle suit on.</i>

133
00:06:43,057 --> 00:06:44,957
Law offices of Barry Zuckerkorn.

134
00:06:45,059 --> 00:06:46,754
It's Michael Bluth for Barry.

135
00:06:46,861 --> 00:06:50,592
- I'm not here.
- Barry's not here. Can I give her a message?

136
00:06:50,698 --> 00:06:52,928
Tell her she needs to whisper
a little softer next time...

137
00:06:53,034 --> 00:06:55,832
and I'm not paying
for this phone call.

138
00:06:55,937 --> 00:06:58,633
I am not a girl, you bow-tied...

139
00:06:58,739 --> 00:07:01,230
Go on. Call me something.
I'm redoing my kitchen.

140
00:07:01,342 --> 00:07:04,277
That's it.
I've had it with this jerk Barry.

141
00:07:04,378 --> 00:07:06,676
I'm going to make Mom sit down with Wayne
whether she likes it or not.

142
00:07:06,781 --> 00:07:09,807
- You're the jerk.
- Did I just wake you up?
I didn't know you were home.

143
00:07:09,917 --> 00:07:12,681
No, Michael, I don't just sleep all day.

144
00:07:12,787 --> 00:07:14,687
<i>Actually, Lindsay was so upset at Michael...</i>

145
00:07:14,789 --> 00:07:17,849
<i>that she tried meditating
to calm herself...</i>

146
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:20,723
<i>but ended up taking
a two-hour angry nap.</i>

147
00:07:20,828 --> 00:07:22,989
Yeah, this suitcase
should be big enough.

148
00:07:23,097 --> 00:07:26,260
Where is all this coming from?
I thought we were getting along.

149
00:07:26,367 --> 00:07:29,131
Yeah, so did I. And now I hear
you're telling our mother...

150
00:07:29,236 --> 00:07:32,763
that I'm completely irresponsible
and a stay-in-bed mom.

151
00:07:32,873 --> 00:07:34,773
That doesn't even sound like me.

152
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:37,935
That sounds like Mom
or Bruce Vilanch.

153
00:07:38,045 --> 00:07:40,343
- Could be Bruce Vilanch.
- Then why would she say it?

154
00:07:40,448 --> 00:07:42,973
- Because we're getting along.
- Because we're friends again.

155
00:07:43,084 --> 00:07:45,609
You gotta remember Mom
typically has nothing in her system...

156
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,711
except a bottle of vodka
and an estrogen pill.

157
00:07:47,822 --> 00:07:50,017
Speaking of which...

158
00:07:50,124 --> 00:07:52,456
<i>Michael and Lindsay proceeded to drink...</i>

159
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,460
<i>and air their grievances
about their mother.</i>

160
00:07:54,562 --> 00:07:58,259
She's always trying to get me to admit
that my marriage isn't working.

161
00:07:58,366 --> 00:08:01,130
- And how's it going with you and Tobias?
- It's not working.

162
00:08:01,235 --> 00:08:04,466
And that's why I wanted her help
with my credit card debt.

163
00:08:04,572 --> 00:08:07,302
I'm trying to take at least some of
the pressure off this marriage.

164
00:08:07,408 --> 00:08:10,809
And if anything, it's worse
now that we're sharing a bedroom.

165
00:08:10,911 --> 00:08:13,709
You guys were not
sharing a bedroom before?

166
00:08:13,814 --> 00:08:16,146
Well, the cutoffs
aren't exactly a turn-on.

167
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:20,516
- What's the deal with the cutoffs?
- You've got to promise not to tell anyone this.

168
00:08:20,621 --> 00:08:24,318
- Okay.
- He's a never-nude.

169
00:08:24,425 --> 00:08:26,757
Is that exactly what it sounds like?

170
00:08:26,861 --> 00:08:29,193
<i>Tobias suffered
a rare psychological affliction...</i>

171
00:08:29,296 --> 00:08:31,890
<i>of never being able
to be completely naked.</i>

172
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,934
Excuse me.
Do these effectively hide my thunder?

173
00:08:35,036 --> 00:08:38,972
Oh, I'm sorry. No, I need you to be
completely undressed.

174
00:08:39,073 --> 00:08:42,099
I am completely undressed.

175
00:08:42,209 --> 00:08:45,007
- I thought he just liked cutoffs.
- Me too.

176
00:08:45,112 --> 00:08:47,512
What about you?
What's going on with your love life?

177
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,515
<i>Have you even met anyone
since your wife?</i>

178
00:08:49,617 --> 00:08:52,518
That is the one subject
I am not eager to talk about, Lindsay.

179
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,884
I love Marta.

180
00:08:56,724 --> 00:08:59,557
- Mom's housekeeper?
- Gob's girlfriend.

181
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,128
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

182
00:09:02,229 --> 00:09:06,063
Listen. You're a great guy,
and if she doesn't see that...

183
00:09:06,167 --> 00:09:09,295
- then someone else will.
- You know what else, Lindsay? You're great.

184
00:09:09,403 --> 00:09:13,464
And I'm gonna move some money around
if it's gonna help you get out of debt.

185
00:09:13,574 --> 00:09:14,973
- No, Michael.
- Yeah.

186
00:09:15,076 --> 00:09:18,637
The hell with Mom. And here.
Mom's never gonna get between us again.

187
00:09:19,814 --> 00:09:22,442
<i>The next day, Buster,
having pawned off playing Adam...</i>

188
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:25,519
<i>went to Lucille 2 to ask her out
for Christmas Eve.</i>

189
00:09:25,619 --> 00:09:29,715
That is terrific 'cause I got
two tickets to the pageant!

190
00:09:29,824 --> 00:09:33,555
My... My mother's going to be there.

191
00:09:33,661 --> 00:09:35,561
<i>And George Michael was trying to pass...</i>

192
00:09:35,663 --> 00:09:37,995
<i>- as a more muscular boy than he actually was.
- One hundred.</i>

193
00:09:38,099 --> 00:09:40,067
One hundred?
I had you at 10.

194
00:09:40,167 --> 00:09:43,762
I did some earlier in the day. It's a running total.
So what's with the suitcase?

195
00:09:43,871 --> 00:09:46,567
It's a little test
to get my parents to notice me.

196
00:09:46,674 --> 00:09:48,574
You ever get the feeling
like no one even sees you?

197
00:09:48,676 --> 00:09:53,010
I've got a really good body, so... no.

198
00:09:53,114 --> 00:09:55,241
Hey, gang. What you doing?

199
00:09:55,349 --> 00:09:57,579
- Just packing up. Packing it on up.
- Uh-huh.

200
00:09:57,685 --> 00:09:59,915
Listen, can I talk to you alone
for a moment?

201
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:03,456
<i>- I'll leave you two alone here.
- Oh, no, George Michael, I meant you.</i>

202
00:10:03,557 --> 00:10:06,117
Maeby, can we have the room?

203
00:10:09,864 --> 00:10:13,823
So, as you know, I was hoping
to play Adam in this thing...

204
00:10:13,934 --> 00:10:17,961
and I want you to know
that I am not threatened.

205
00:10:18,072 --> 00:10:20,336
You know, I'd be happy
to let you play Adam.

206
00:10:20,441 --> 00:10:22,534
Give me the suit.
Give me the suit.

207
00:10:22,643 --> 00:10:26,306
I'm actually wearing it right now,
and I can't tell you why.

208
00:10:26,413 --> 00:10:28,313
You're wearing it right now?

209
00:10:28,415 --> 00:10:31,145
I have to wear it all the time.
You'd never understand.

210
00:10:31,252 --> 00:10:34,619
Oh, please.
I'll never under...

211
00:10:34,722 --> 00:10:38,488
I'll never understand...
that you can never be nude?

212
00:10:44,765 --> 00:10:48,724
<i>I understand more than
you'll never know.</i>

213
00:10:55,242 --> 00:10:57,142
Yikes.

214
00:10:57,244 --> 00:10:59,678
<i>Michael finally arranged
a meeting with attorney WayneJarvis.</i>

215
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,680
Looking for a more professional approach
to our representation.

216
00:11:01,782 --> 00:11:03,079
Well, I'm a professional.

217
00:11:03,184 --> 00:11:06,176
- I'm serious, and I'm a professional.
- That's fantastic.

218
00:11:06,287 --> 00:11:08,721
- So how long have you been practicing...
- I also don't like small talk.

219
00:11:08,822 --> 00:11:12,155
I find that unprofessional.
Why should I be billing you for small talk...

220
00:11:12,259 --> 00:11:14,159
when I'm enjoying it
as much as you are?

221
00:11:14,261 --> 00:11:17,321
Then this must be a freebie
'cause I'm having a ball.

222
00:11:17,431 --> 00:11:19,831
When you're ready
to get serious, give me a call.

223
00:11:19,934 --> 00:11:24,394
No, no! No, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm serious. I'm ready.

224
00:11:24,505 --> 00:11:28,373
Good. If you retain my services,
I will get your father out of jail...

225
00:11:28,475 --> 00:11:30,375
and we will be countersuing
before the end of the year.

226
00:11:30,477 --> 00:11:33,173
We're gonna get this company's name
back to where it started.

227
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,840
- Or hopefully higher.
- I didn't say that. Don't hold me to that.

228
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:39,750
I won't, and I appreciate that
to a wonderful degree.

229
00:11:39,853 --> 00:11:42,253
My mother is on her way up here...

230
00:11:42,356 --> 00:11:46,053
and she's resistant
to the idea of hiring a new attorney.

231
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,628
If she even sees you,
she probably won't come in the room.

232
00:11:48,729 --> 00:11:51,254
I shall duck behind the couch.

233
00:11:51,365 --> 00:11:53,799
What a pro.

234
00:11:55,102 --> 00:11:56,660
- Michael.
- Hi.

235
00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:00,001
I need to get the money
to get your father out for the pageant.

236
00:12:00,107 --> 00:12:03,543
Actually, that's not why
I called you here today, and I'm not doing that.

237
00:12:03,644 --> 00:12:06,238
I gave that money to Lindsay
to pay off her credit card debt.

238
00:12:06,347 --> 00:12:09,805
- What'd she do, get you drunk?
- No, we just, uh, well...

239
00:12:09,917 --> 00:12:12,579
We did drink a little bit.
How'd you know that?

240
00:12:12,686 --> 00:12:14,586
Because that's what
she said she'd do.

241
00:12:14,688 --> 00:12:17,816
I said you wouldn't give her the money,
and she said, "He will if I get him drunk."

242
00:12:17,925 --> 00:12:20,223
Probably because she thinks
you're a cheap bastard.

243
00:12:20,327 --> 00:12:22,318
Oh. Her words.

244
00:12:22,429 --> 00:12:24,397
She set me up?

245
00:12:24,498 --> 00:12:29,231
All that stuff about her marital troubles
and Tobias being a never-nude?

246
00:12:29,336 --> 00:12:33,238
A never-nude?
I thought he just liked cutoffs.

247
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:35,399
How do you treat somebody
in your own family like that...

248
00:12:35,509 --> 00:12:39,878
lying and deceiving and saying anything
just to get your own way?

249
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,744
- So what did you want to see me about?
- Hmm?

250
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:46,411
Oh, um, there's a big bowl
of candy in my office.

251
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,250
<i>- Why don't you go eat it?
- WayneJarvis, attorney at law.</i>

252
00:12:49,356 --> 00:12:53,690
I have a responsibility to tell you
that there is no candy in this office.

253
00:12:53,794 --> 00:12:56,285
Lindsay.

254
00:12:59,998 --> 00:13:02,831
- What are you doing here?
- I had to get away from Marta.

255
00:13:02,934 --> 00:13:07,769
<i>If I have to smell another meal of fish,
rice and mango, I'm gonna kill somebody.</i>

256
00:13:07,872 --> 00:13:11,433
- Now Michael's learning Spanish.
What's up with that?
- Oh, who knows?

257
00:13:11,543 --> 00:13:13,443
He won't get your father
out of jail for a night.

258
00:13:13,545 --> 00:13:16,105
<i>- He's bringing in a new attorney.
- New attorney?</i>

259
00:13:16,214 --> 00:13:19,149
And he's learning Spanish?

260
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,241
He's hiding something.

261
00:13:21,352 --> 00:13:23,980
And I intend to find out what it is.

262
00:13:24,088 --> 00:13:27,683
Do yourself a favor.
Get him drunk.

263
00:13:33,932 --> 00:13:35,957
Barry.

264
00:13:37,302 --> 00:13:39,736
I see you're getting closer
to our attorney.

265
00:13:39,838 --> 00:13:43,467
<i>Well, I just want you to know
that I won't be needing your help after all.</i>

266
00:13:43,575 --> 00:13:48,274
My brother Michael came through
as he always does and as you never do.

267
00:13:48,379 --> 00:13:52,338
Whatever it takes to get your relationship
with that never-nude back on track.

268
00:13:54,452 --> 00:13:56,818
- Michael told you that?
- He couldn't wait to.

269
00:13:56,921 --> 00:13:59,287
<i>And later,
while Michael was meeting with Wayne...</i>

270
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:02,723
My thing with Tobias was a secret
like you stealing your brother's girlfriend!

271
00:14:02,827 --> 00:14:05,523
- I open up to you, and you run and tell Mommy!
- Excuse me.

272
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,495
Outside, please.
Thank you. Pardon us.

273
00:14:07,599 --> 00:14:11,262
Like it all wasn't just lies to get me to pay
that debt. Isn't that why you got me drunk?

274
00:14:11,369 --> 00:14:13,496
<i>- I got you drunk.
- Mom told me about your little plan.</i>

275
00:14:13,605 --> 00:14:16,870
- What plan? I had a great time last night!
- So did I!

276
00:14:16,975 --> 00:14:19,341
- Then why are we yelling at each other?
- Mom.

277
00:14:19,444 --> 00:14:22,845
- Unbelievable.
- She did it again.

278
00:14:22,947 --> 00:14:25,848
- All right. We've got to teach her a lesson.
- Hmm.

279
00:14:27,185 --> 00:14:31,087
<i>Excuse me, Wayne, my sister and I were
outside having a business discussion...</i>

280
00:14:31,189 --> 00:14:33,714
and we were wondering
if there's some sort of legal way...

281
00:14:33,825 --> 00:14:36,555
that we can humiliate our mother.

282
00:14:36,661 --> 00:14:39,027
Something shaming, something public.

283
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:42,293
I've used one adjective to describe myself.
What is it?

284
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,368
Professional.

285
00:14:51,142 --> 00:14:53,042
So how are we going to screw Mom?

286
00:14:53,144 --> 00:14:54,805
<i>- Maybe we can get Barry to help.
- Forget it.</i>

287
00:14:54,913 --> 00:14:57,973
I think I was right about them all along.
You know Barry's taking Mom to the pageant?

288
00:14:58,082 --> 00:14:59,811
- On a date?
- Yeah.

289
00:14:59,918 --> 00:15:05,288
Ugh! If Dad could see her
on a date with Barry, he'd go crazy.

290
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:08,086
<i>Which would allow us to hire Wayne.</i>

291
00:15:09,961 --> 00:15:12,987
How do you feel about staying in debt
just a little bit longer?

292
00:15:13,097 --> 00:15:16,498
<i>So they decided to spend
the money Michael had promised Lindsay...</i>

293
00:15:16,601 --> 00:15:20,628
<i>to get their father out for the pageant,
where he'd catch his wife with Barry.</i>

294
00:15:20,738 --> 00:15:24,299
<i>Maeby, too, continued to try
to teach her parents a lesson.</i>

295
00:15:24,409 --> 00:15:26,969
Okay, so I printed the fake airline ticket
from my computer.

296
00:15:27,078 --> 00:15:30,570
If my parents miss this,
I really might go to South America.

297
00:15:30,682 --> 00:15:33,242
- That says "Portugal."
- That's right.

298
00:15:33,351 --> 00:15:37,481
<i>Maeby's parents didn't find the ticket,
but Gob did...</i>

299
00:15:37,588 --> 00:15:39,488
"Portugal."

300
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,922
<i>which confirmed his suspicions.</i>

301
00:15:42,026 --> 00:15:44,620
Gonna live it up down old
South America way, huh, Mikey?

302
00:15:44,729 --> 00:15:48,028
<i>And Buster finally gave in
to Lucille 2's wishes.</i>

303
00:15:48,132 --> 00:15:51,533
You ready to show me off
before God and the whole world?

304
00:15:51,636 --> 00:15:53,831
It's not my dad's reaction
I'm worried about.

305
00:15:53,938 --> 00:15:58,034
<i>And George Michael finally saw the painting
he was going to be re-creating.</i>

306
00:16:01,913 --> 00:16:05,440
<i>And then what "frontspiece"meant.</i>

307
00:16:11,456 --> 00:16:16,393
<i>George Sr. got his 24 hours of freedom
as the pageant finally began.</i>

308
00:16:16,494 --> 00:16:20,225
You know, I saw you do this when I was a kid.
I was so impressed.

309
00:16:20,331 --> 00:16:24,267
You know, you were
so still and godlike.

310
00:16:24,369 --> 00:16:26,735
It was at that moment
that I knew I would be a dancer.

311
00:16:28,306 --> 00:16:30,206
Glad I could make a difference.

312
00:16:30,308 --> 00:16:32,970
<i>Michael and Lindsay searched the crowd
for their mother and Barry...</i>

313
00:16:33,077 --> 00:16:36,535
<i>so they could revel in the public shaming
they had engineered.</i>

314
00:16:36,647 --> 00:16:40,583
<i>- Mom, what the hell are you doing?
- But instead they found her with Wayne.</i>

315
00:16:40,685 --> 00:16:42,585
I don't have to answer that.

316
00:16:42,687 --> 00:16:44,848
I don't know which one of you
I'm more disappointed in.

317
00:16:44,956 --> 00:16:46,981
No, it's Wayne. Wayne...

318
00:16:47,091 --> 00:16:49,719
- I have needs. I am a man!
- Hey, watch...

319
00:16:49,827 --> 00:16:52,591
What's the difference?
Your father doesn't care about me.

320
00:16:52,697 --> 00:16:55,188
Barry tells me he's not even trying
to get out of prison.

321
00:16:55,299 --> 00:16:58,063
- Mom, he's here. Dad's here.
- He's here?

322
00:16:58,169 --> 00:17:00,501
- Yeah, he's here.
- Why did you do this?

323
00:17:00,605 --> 00:17:02,937
<i>- We were trying to teach you a lesson.
- You idiots!</i>

324
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:06,169
- If he sees me with Wayne...
- We'll be stuck with Barry.

325
00:17:06,277 --> 00:17:09,269
I shall duck behind
that little garbage car.

326
00:17:10,715 --> 00:17:12,615
Guy's a pro.

327
00:17:12,717 --> 00:17:14,617
<i>And now, ladies and gentlemen...</i>

328
00:17:14,719 --> 00:17:17,449
<i>Michelangelo's
The Creation of Adam.</i>

329
00:17:17,555 --> 00:17:20,752
<i>And George Michael made his debut...</i>

330
00:17:20,858 --> 00:17:23,258
Hey, that's my... Yikes.

331
00:17:23,361 --> 00:17:25,295
<i>breaking the pageant's cardinal rule.</i>

332
00:17:25,396 --> 00:17:27,023
How dare he!

333
00:17:27,131 --> 00:17:30,100
Oh, stop booing!
There's nothing wrong with it.

334
00:17:30,201 --> 00:17:34,194
There are dozens of us. Dozens!

335
00:17:34,305 --> 00:17:36,398
<i>Buster arrived with Lucille Austero...</i>

336
00:17:36,507 --> 00:17:40,307
<i>and naturally assumed the yells of disgust
were directed toward him.</i>

337
00:17:40,411 --> 00:17:42,538
- What is wrong with you?
- What's wrong with you?

338
00:17:42,647 --> 00:17:44,808
Buster?

339
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:46,907
Oh, God! I'm sorry.

340
00:17:47,018 --> 00:17:50,385
I'm sorry, Lucille.
Yeah. Lucille.

341
00:17:50,488 --> 00:17:52,456
Ma, I'm sorry!

342
00:17:52,557 --> 00:17:57,085
Man! That old lady has really
done a number on you, hasn't she?

343
00:17:58,396 --> 00:18:01,661
<i>But George Michael wasn't
the only problem with the painting.</i>

344
00:18:01,766 --> 00:18:04,394
- Where is God?
- There is no God!

345
00:18:07,672 --> 00:18:09,572
There goes my credit card payment.

346
00:18:09,674 --> 00:18:11,938
Dad! Dad!

347
00:18:12,043 --> 00:18:14,011
Hey! Dad!

348
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,080
- Excuse me.
- Dad!

349
00:18:18,182 --> 00:18:21,777
- Hey, Dad, get back here!
- No! I'm not going back!

350
00:18:21,886 --> 00:18:23,786
Dad, come here!

351
00:18:23,888 --> 00:18:27,847
- Dad!
- Michael, I'm onto you.

352
00:18:27,959 --> 00:18:30,621
The Spanish lessons, the lawyer.

353
00:18:30,728 --> 00:18:34,528
- If you're heading for Portugal, it's due south!
- What? No, it isn't.

354
00:18:34,632 --> 00:18:37,294
Dad, you're not gonna outrun me
in that dress.

355
00:18:37,401 --> 00:18:41,360
- Let go! For God's sakes,
I'm not even wearing a jock.
- Dad, are you going too?

356
00:18:44,876 --> 00:18:47,640
No one is going to Portugal, you idiot!

357
00:18:47,745 --> 00:18:51,010
Lindsay and I broke Dad out of jail for a day
to catch Mom on a date.

358
00:18:51,115 --> 00:18:53,811
Your mother is on a date? Oh.

359
00:18:53,918 --> 00:18:55,180
Dad!

360
00:18:55,286 --> 00:18:58,619
Oh, oh.

361
00:18:58,723 --> 00:19:01,351
<i>- Dad?
- And so, many in the Bluth family...</i>

362
00:19:01,459 --> 00:19:04,394
<i>gathered together
for Christmas Eve... at prison.</i>

363
00:19:04,495 --> 00:19:07,123
- Hey, where'd your muscle suit go?
- Wait. You knew?

364
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:08,630
Yeah.

365
00:19:08,733 --> 00:19:10,667
I took it off.

366
00:19:13,638 --> 00:19:15,538
You did?

367
00:19:18,342 --> 00:19:21,778
You have made some
tremendous strides today.

368
00:19:23,347 --> 00:19:25,474
Ever get the feeling
like you don't even matter?

369
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,847
Only when I'm around my children.

370
00:19:27,952 --> 00:19:31,820
You reach a certain age, and you have
to practically scream to get noticed.

371
00:19:31,923 --> 00:19:35,825
They turn you into a monster,
and then they call you one.

372
00:19:35,927 --> 00:19:38,327
I don't think you're a monster.

373
00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:40,329
And I think you're a lovely girl.

374
00:19:40,431 --> 00:19:42,695
You know what?

375
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,200
I think you and I
ought to spend more time together.

376
00:19:45,303 --> 00:19:47,430
Yeah.

377
00:19:48,673 --> 00:19:52,234
- That'll drive them crazy.
- Exactly.

378
00:19:52,343 --> 00:19:54,243
<i>And Michael was forced to, once again...</i>

379
00:19:54,345 --> 00:19:56,813
<i>call in the counsel of Barry Zuckerkorn.</i>

380
00:19:56,914 --> 00:19:59,075
Thank you. Thank you
for coming down on Christmas Eve.

381
00:19:59,183 --> 00:20:02,516
Oh, it's like any other day,
except that I bill double.

382
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,747
<i>So, they're not filing charges.</i>

383
00:20:04,855 --> 00:20:09,417
I got them to call your flee from justice
"religious expression."

384
00:20:09,527 --> 00:20:12,291
- This is a lawyer.
- Yeah, he's... he's very good.

385
00:20:12,396 --> 00:20:15,524
You're gonna have to forfeit that bond.
I was way off about that.

386
00:20:15,633 --> 00:20:17,760
Thanks again, Mikey.

387
00:20:20,404 --> 00:20:22,872
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

388
00:20:22,974 --> 00:20:26,000
Are all the guys in here, you know...

389
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:28,908
Oh, no, no, no.
Not all of them.

390
00:20:29,013 --> 00:20:32,380
Yeah. It's never the ones you hope.

391
00:20:34,452 --> 00:20:37,114
- Hope?
- Think.

392
00:20:37,221 --> 00:20:40,884
<i>- How'd it go?
- Well, the bad news is you're in debt again...</i>

393
00:20:40,992 --> 00:20:43,586
and we never busted Mom,
and we're stuck with Barry.

394
00:20:43,694 --> 00:20:47,892
The good news is we've been asked
never to participate in the pageant again.

395
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,992
- Well, at least we're still pals, huh?
- Yeah.

396
00:20:53,404 --> 00:20:56,737
That's not really doing it for me this time.

397
00:20:56,841 --> 00:20:58,741
Yeah.
