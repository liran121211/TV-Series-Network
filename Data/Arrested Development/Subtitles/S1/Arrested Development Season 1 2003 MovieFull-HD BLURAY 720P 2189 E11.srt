1
00:00:01,153 --> 00:00:04,179
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:06,656
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:08,750
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:14,267 --> 00:00:15,928
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

5
00:00:18,971 --> 00:00:20,871
<i>Michael Bluth was taking his son...</i>

6
00:00:20,973 --> 00:00:23,498
<i>to an interview at the prestigious
Milford School...</i>

7
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:26,772
<i>an institution
once famous for its credo...</i>

8
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:29,575
<i>that children should be
"neither seen nor heard."</i>

9
00:00:29,682 --> 00:00:31,843
"Woman."

10
00:00:33,386 --> 00:00:35,286
They're not getting in.

11
00:00:35,388 --> 00:00:38,721
- I might not get in either, and that
wouldn't be the end of the world.
- Shh.

12
00:00:38,824 --> 00:00:41,384
We're not even going down
that road, okay?

13
00:00:41,494 --> 00:00:44,019
The next four years
are all about your future...

14
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:46,291
and that's the most
important thing to me, okay?

15
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,698
Things have changed around here.
We have talking sessions throughout the day.

16
00:00:49,802 --> 00:00:52,635
<i>We even have a talking room
where students are encouraged...</i>

17
00:00:52,738 --> 00:00:55,206
to go in and talk
to their heart's content.

18
00:00:55,308 --> 00:00:58,141
- Sounds like fun.
- First thing he's said all day.

19
00:00:58,244 --> 00:01:00,371
The point is I'm not my father.

20
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:03,107
<i>I do think it's best
for the Milford School...</i>

21
00:01:03,215 --> 00:01:05,706
<i>to distance itself
from the Bluth name.</i>

22
00:01:05,818 --> 00:01:07,718
It's... nothing personal.

23
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,288
Are you talking about the fact
that my father is in jail?

24
00:01:10,389 --> 00:01:13,051
Because I don't like to be
compared to my father either.

25
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:16,219
- I don't mind being compared to my father.
- Save it for the talk room.

26
00:01:16,329 --> 00:01:20,732
- Sorry.
- I can assure you that my family
is back on track...

27
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:24,894
<i>- and no longer in any trouble.
- Not according to today's paper.</i>

28
00:01:25,004 --> 00:01:26,972
Oh, God.
What have we done this time?

29
00:01:31,077 --> 00:01:35,776
- Don't ever mention Klimpy's to me again.
- What did you do?

30
00:01:35,881 --> 00:01:39,647
If I still had money, I'd buy a Klimpy's
just to burn it to the ground.

31
00:01:39,752 --> 00:01:42,084
I know, Mom. You hate Klimpy's.
Tell me what happened.

32
00:01:42,188 --> 00:01:46,181
Your sister and I tried to get into
that new restaurant, Rud...

33
00:01:46,292 --> 00:01:48,283
and they wouldn't let us in.

34
00:01:48,394 --> 00:01:50,089
Mrs. Bluth, there's absolutely no room.

35
00:01:50,196 --> 00:01:53,222
Come on. I've suddenly lost my appetite.

36
00:01:53,332 --> 00:01:55,232
Oh, who's going to believe that?

37
00:01:55,334 --> 00:01:57,427
<i>With her blood sugar at a perilous low...</i>

38
00:01:57,536 --> 00:02:00,096
<i>Lucille made Lindsay pull into
the nearest restaurant.</i>

39
00:02:00,206 --> 00:02:03,175
Welcome to Klimpy's!
Anywhere you like!

40
00:02:03,275 --> 00:02:05,175
This does not bode well.

41
00:02:06,646 --> 00:02:10,844
- I'll have the Ike and Tina Tuna.
- Plate or platter?

42
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,680
- I don't understand the question,
and I won't respond to it.

43
00:02:13,786 --> 00:02:17,449
- And what would you like?
- I'd like my old life back.

44
00:02:17,556 --> 00:02:20,548
So there really was no fight?

45
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,686
Well, one tiny thing at the end.

46
00:02:23,796 --> 00:02:28,358
- How can you treat me this way?
- Oh, please! Everything I've said about you...

47
00:02:28,467 --> 00:02:32,198
can be covered with makeup
and a lie about a thyroid problem.

48
00:02:32,304 --> 00:02:38,004
Good grief almighty!
You think I'm enjoying my slide into poverty?

49
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:41,307
Sorry, Lindsay.
There goes your dessert.

50
00:02:42,915 --> 00:02:44,815
Why don't you eat it, Mother?

51
00:02:44,917 --> 00:02:48,478
Why don't you just take this cake
and shove it...

52
00:02:48,587 --> 00:02:51,147
Hey, who called the cops?

53
00:02:51,257 --> 00:02:54,488
It was all just a big misunderstanding.

54
00:02:54,593 --> 00:02:56,493
Totally blown out of proportion.

55
00:02:56,595 --> 00:03:01,089
<i>Well, listen, I think it cost George Michael
a chance to go to the Milford School.</i>

56
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,432
Oh, big deal.
Buster's the only one who ever liked it.

57
00:03:05,538 --> 00:03:08,871
<i>Buster so excelled at being
neither seen nor heard...</i>

58
00:03:08,974 --> 00:03:12,068
<i>that he remained at the school
undetected for a full two semesters...</i>

59
00:03:12,178 --> 00:03:14,339
<i>after he was supposed to graduate.</i>

60
00:03:14,447 --> 00:03:16,847
Nonetheless, this bad press
is starting to taint my son's future...

61
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:18,849
and we've got to put an end to it.

62
00:03:18,951 --> 00:03:22,284
Michael, if this is a lecture on how we're all
supposed to whatever and blah, blah, blah...

63
00:03:22,388 --> 00:03:24,948
well, you can save it
'cause we all know it by heart.

64
00:03:25,057 --> 00:03:28,584
- Good-bye, Missus.
- Lindsay, you'll be happy to know
that I have a new idea.

65
00:03:28,694 --> 00:03:32,130
I met a publicist today.
I'm gonna hire her.

66
00:03:32,231 --> 00:03:35,689
- We need somebody to make us look good.
- I say it's a waste of money.

67
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:39,032
We're plenty sympathetic as we are.

68
00:03:39,138 --> 00:03:41,038
- Is this your onion?
- Yes.

69
00:03:43,175 --> 00:03:46,269
- What's in the foil?
- Nothing. It's a ball of foil for my son.

70
00:03:46,378 --> 00:03:48,710
Have a great day, sweetie.

71
00:03:48,814 --> 00:03:51,578
I don't know how she can't.

72
00:03:51,684 --> 00:03:55,484
So this publicist, Michael, is she cute?

73
00:03:55,588 --> 00:03:58,580
<i>I never really noticed.
- In fact, Michael
had noticed her at the gym...</i>

74
00:03:58,691 --> 00:04:01,558
<i>but only recently gotten up
the nerve to talk to her...</i>

75
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:04,458
<i>giving him a chance to work
on his flirting skills...</i>

76
00:04:04,563 --> 00:04:08,055
<i>- Race you to the top of the hill.
- which had gotten rusty over the years.</i>

77
00:04:08,167 --> 00:04:13,469
- I'll race you to the top of the hill.
- I brought a picnic lunch.

78
00:04:13,572 --> 00:04:16,700
- Hey, that hill was really...
- Jessie Bowers.

79
00:04:16,809 --> 00:04:19,107
If you ever have any
public relations needs...

80
00:04:19,211 --> 00:04:21,907
My relations are already a little too public.
I'm Michael Bluth.

81
00:04:22,014 --> 00:04:24,244
- From the Bluth Company?
- That's right.

82
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,250
I'm giving you my direct line.

83
00:04:27,553 --> 00:04:29,817
<i>Okay, sure. She's...
She's cute, I suppose.</i>

84
00:04:29,922 --> 00:04:33,085
I mean, now that you're making me
think about it, uh, she's cute.

85
00:04:33,192 --> 00:04:38,357
She's a cutie. She's a little cutie pie.
But I never really noticed.

86
00:04:38,464 --> 00:04:40,932
- Why don't you just ask her out?
- That's not an option.

87
00:04:41,033 --> 00:04:43,433
<i>- 'Cause you're scared?
- No, because of George Michael.</i>

88
00:04:43,536 --> 00:04:45,436
He still hasn't gotten over
losing his mother.

89
00:04:45,538 --> 00:04:47,938
I just want to get him through high school;
then we'll deal with me.

90
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,008
So you didn't get any
while you were in high school...

91
00:04:50,109 --> 00:04:53,875
and now you're not gonna get any
while George Michael's in high school.

92
00:04:53,979 --> 00:04:55,947
<i>And so the family gathered
at the model home...</i>

93
00:04:56,048 --> 00:04:58,482
<i>eager to hear
their new publicist's plan.</i>

94
00:04:58,584 --> 00:05:01,712
<i>- Get jobs and behave?
- Instead of us getting jobs...</i>

95
00:05:01,821 --> 00:05:04,187
why don't you do your job and
tell everyone we've got jobs?

96
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,554
- I have a job.
- Kiss ass.

97
00:05:06,659 --> 00:05:09,184
<i>Well, we were all thinking it.</i>

98
00:05:09,295 --> 00:05:12,230
<i>Uh, I'm unclear about
what it is exactly you do.</i>

99
00:05:12,331 --> 00:05:13,628
Excellent question.
A publicist...

100
00:05:13,732 --> 00:05:15,962
No, no. I was talking
to George Michael.

101
00:05:16,068 --> 00:05:18,195
When did you get a job?

102
00:05:18,304 --> 00:05:20,829
- At the banana stand.
- Oh! Duh.

103
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,204
I thought you meant like
a plumber or something.

104
00:05:23,309 --> 00:05:26,506
And I was like, "When did that happen?"

105
00:05:26,612 --> 00:05:28,978
<i>Jessie, why don't you just
go ahead andjump in here.</i>

106
00:05:29,081 --> 00:05:30,981
It's a tough group
to keep focused.

107
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:34,712
I'm going on the offensive.
I want to get an article in the paper...

108
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,755
to show that this is a functional family
and a relatable family.

109
00:05:37,857 --> 00:05:40,655
Are we on? Hello!
Hello from prison!

110
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:43,694
<i>Thanks toJessie
for setting up this telelink.</i>

111
00:05:43,796 --> 00:05:46,697
I've started a Torah study group.
I'm very excited about it.

112
00:05:46,799 --> 00:05:51,702
Looks like... I don't know... looks like
I have some possible converts.

113
00:05:51,804 --> 00:05:53,839
Your father's religious now?
We'll play that up.

114
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:55,431
Your father's religious now?
We'll play that up.

115
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:58,339
- It's very sympathetic.
- Yeah. Who doesn't love theJews?

116
00:05:58,444 --> 00:06:01,538
And it allows me to put
Michael front and center.

117
00:06:01,647 --> 00:06:03,547
He needs to be
the new face of this family.

118
00:06:03,649 --> 00:06:06,015
He's the only likable one
in the bunch. No offense.

119
00:06:06,118 --> 00:06:09,610
<i>- None taken.
- I'm sorry.</i>

120
00:06:09,722 --> 00:06:11,917
Isn't Michael the least likable one
in the family?

121
00:06:12,024 --> 00:06:14,185
<i>No. There are very few intelligent...</i>

122
00:06:14,293 --> 00:06:17,456
attractive and straight men
in this town.

123
00:06:17,563 --> 00:06:20,498
Well, that certainly leaves me out.

124
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:22,863
She... She said single.

125
00:06:22,968 --> 00:06:27,803
You did say "single," correct?
I thought l...

126
00:06:27,907 --> 00:06:29,807
I didn't quite hear that.
The reception is bad.

127
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:31,809
But as the Talmud tells us...

128
00:06:34,446 --> 00:06:36,539
...to the jackal as to an oxen.

129
00:06:36,649 --> 00:06:39,914
Did it get a laugh?

130
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:42,044
Sorry. I'm still on the whole
Michael being likable thing.

131
00:06:42,154 --> 00:06:45,214
<i>You know that he's only had sex
with, like, four women, right?</i>

132
00:06:45,324 --> 00:06:47,224
<i>Let's focus on your likability.</i>

133
00:06:47,326 --> 00:06:49,886
You're going to start doing
some charity work with your magic.

134
00:06:49,995 --> 00:06:52,520
<i>Actually, I'm kind of
the charitable one of the family.</i>

135
00:06:52,631 --> 00:06:55,293
<i>- I think it's best if you got a job.
- Oh, come on!</i>

136
00:06:55,401 --> 00:06:58,802
I'm a parent. I care about my daughter every
bit as much as Michael cares about his son.

137
00:06:58,904 --> 00:07:01,372
What grade am I in?

138
00:07:01,473 --> 00:07:03,907
<i>- What kind of job?
- Something where you'll be seen.</i>

139
00:07:04,009 --> 00:07:05,909
I represent Cloudmir Vodka...

140
00:07:06,011 --> 00:07:09,139
<i>and they want someone to promote it
by ordering it at a hot bar.</i>

141
00:07:09,248 --> 00:07:12,445
- A place like Rud.
- Okay. I'll do it.

142
00:07:12,551 --> 00:07:14,678
<i>And, Tobias,
you're a medical doctor...</i>

143
00:07:14,787 --> 00:07:17,312
and you're living an absurd fantasy
as an actor.

144
00:07:17,423 --> 00:07:20,483
- It's time to get real.
- Wow.

145
00:07:20,592 --> 00:07:23,083
It's tough talk, but I like it.

146
00:07:23,195 --> 00:07:25,425
You're saying land a major film.

147
00:07:25,531 --> 00:07:27,260
I'm saying get your medical license back.

148
00:07:27,366 --> 00:07:30,028
I've set up a hearing
for tomorrow in Boston.

149
00:07:30,135 --> 00:07:34,265
<i>- Michael has generously donated $1,100
for your trip.
- I'm sorry.</i>

150
00:07:34,373 --> 00:07:37,865
I truly believe that the universe wants me
to be an actor and not a doctor.

151
00:07:37,977 --> 00:07:40,946
- I'm just waiting for a sign.
- Here's your cash.

152
00:07:41,046 --> 00:07:44,948
- Universal Shuttle picks you up at 8:00.
- Any sign, really.

153
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:48,679
Sorry. Some of my students
are arguing the significance...

154
00:07:48,787 --> 00:07:51,085
of the shank bone
on the seder plate.

155
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:56,628
But that... Not... not wag our genitals
at one another to make a point.

156
00:07:56,729 --> 00:08:01,291
- Thought provoking.
- And, Lucille, people think you're cold.

157
00:08:02,801 --> 00:08:06,032
Hanukkah can be spelled so many ways. Oh, God!

158
00:08:10,075 --> 00:08:13,203
- Buster.
- Right here. Ready to go.

159
00:08:13,312 --> 00:08:15,303
At your service.
Get me out there.

160
00:08:15,414 --> 00:08:17,314
<i>I want you to stay in.</i>

161
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:19,884
<i>People find you
odd and alienating.</i>

162
00:08:19,985 --> 00:08:22,681
<i>You make them uneasy.
Stay out of the spotlight.</i>

163
00:08:22,788 --> 00:08:26,781
I shall be neither seen nor heard.
Watch me.

164
00:08:27,893 --> 00:08:30,327
You can always tell a Milford man.

165
00:08:37,135 --> 00:08:39,228
<i>Each with their new charge...</i>

166
00:08:39,337 --> 00:08:41,897
<i>the Bluths set about
redefining their image.</i>

167
00:08:42,006 --> 00:08:44,907
<i>Tobias was off to Los Angeles
International Airport...</i>

168
00:08:45,009 --> 00:08:47,534
<i>determined to return
to his family with a career.</i>

169
00:08:47,645 --> 00:08:49,545
Well, this is great.

170
00:08:49,647 --> 00:08:52,081
Why would anybody take a limo?

171
00:08:52,183 --> 00:08:54,651
What is this, like, $12?

172
00:08:54,752 --> 00:08:58,950
Why would anybody pay more than $12
to go to the airport?

173
00:08:59,057 --> 00:09:01,184
Next stop, LAX.

174
00:09:01,292 --> 00:09:04,352
Come on! We're stopping again?
How many more stops are we gonna make?

175
00:09:04,462 --> 00:09:09,195
Honestly, I haven't even seen
this part of Los Ang... Is that snow?

176
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,200
<i>Really, now. This is ridiculous.</i>

177
00:09:11,302 --> 00:09:15,102
<i>I paid 12 American...
Oh, my God.</i>

178
00:09:15,206 --> 00:09:19,404
You are Carl Weathers, the actor.

179
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:22,536
I went to San Francisco to attend
your stage fighting workshop.

180
00:09:22,647 --> 00:09:26,777
- But you never showed up.
- I got bumped from that flight.

181
00:09:26,884 --> 00:09:28,784
Hell, they'll give you $300
if you get bumped.

182
00:09:28,886 --> 00:09:33,687
It's this crazy loophole in the system
that the wrong guy discovered.

183
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:37,693
Guess where I won't be going.

184
00:09:37,795 --> 00:09:41,253
Yeah. So...

185
00:09:41,365 --> 00:09:43,856
I am an actor too.

186
00:09:43,968 --> 00:09:45,993
- Oh. Good.
- Well, I want to be.

187
00:09:46,104 --> 00:09:50,507
Without the proper training,
I'm afraid I'm doomed to be a doctor.

188
00:09:50,608 --> 00:09:52,974
Well, hell, I can train you.

189
00:09:53,077 --> 00:09:55,671
Oh, well, I'm afraid
all I have is $1,100...

190
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:58,180
and that's for this plane ticket, so...

191
00:09:58,282 --> 00:10:03,379
Check this out. $1,100 is exactly
what I charge for acting classes.

192
00:10:03,488 --> 00:10:05,115
- No, it isn't!
- Yeah.

193
00:10:05,223 --> 00:10:07,714
What are the chance...

194
00:10:07,825 --> 00:10:10,919
Universe, you've done it again.

195
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:15,158
<i>Meanwhile, Gob was beginning
his charity work at a local nursing home.</i>

196
00:10:15,266 --> 00:10:19,566
I'm gonna need a volunteer
for my next illusion, the Aztec Tomb!

197
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:23,106
<i>- A tomb?
- Or box. Box is... fine.</i>

198
00:10:23,207 --> 00:10:26,506
<i>Oh, yes! Well, excellent.
Let's get you in the box.</i>

199
00:10:26,611 --> 00:10:28,511
There's a panel.

200
00:10:28,613 --> 00:10:32,049
just flip it around, curl up behind it,
don't make any noise.

201
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:39,947
<i>Ancient lore has it the Aztec gods
put a curse on any man who dare...</i>

202
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:44,494
- What?
- He's gone.

203
00:10:44,595 --> 00:10:47,655
<i>Buster was also
doing his share for the family.</i>

204
00:10:52,303 --> 00:10:55,295
<i>And Michael, atJessie's insistence,
was out on the town.</i>

205
00:10:55,406 --> 00:10:58,000
I haven't been out to dinner in so long,
I feel a little guilty.

206
00:10:58,109 --> 00:11:00,543
You have nothing
to be guilty about.

207
00:11:00,645 --> 00:11:03,205
You're the only one in your family
who's ever been responsible.

208
00:11:03,314 --> 00:11:05,714
Well, I'm certainly the only one
that's ever held a real job.

209
00:11:05,816 --> 00:11:08,717
<i>Oh, really, Michael? Watch this.</i>

210
00:11:08,819 --> 00:11:11,310
Wow! This Cloudmir's
making me think fuzzy.

211
00:11:11,422 --> 00:11:14,016
I have almost no judgment at all.

212
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:17,526
- Two more Cloudmirs, please.
- "Only one with a real job."

213
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:21,823
jessie, you've really been doing
a great job with my family.

214
00:11:21,933 --> 00:11:25,266
<i>- Oh, good. Get one of Michael and me on a date.
- Sure.</i>

215
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:28,270
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

216
00:11:28,372 --> 00:11:31,671
A date? This is a date now?
I thought this was just business.

217
00:11:31,776 --> 00:11:34,609
Can't it be a little bit of both?

218
00:11:34,712 --> 00:11:36,680
How will I know
which part of it is business?

219
00:11:36,781 --> 00:11:39,045
Uh-oh.

220
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:44,083
Can't wait to see
which part of it is a date.

221
00:11:50,561 --> 00:11:52,290
Show me business again.

222
00:11:52,396 --> 00:11:54,227
<i>What you doing?</i>

223
00:11:54,332 --> 00:11:56,892
just trying to get the TVworking.

224
00:11:57,001 --> 00:11:59,902
Oh, yeah, I tried that earlier.
I think it's still hooked up to the prison.

225
00:12:00,004 --> 00:12:03,269
So when those guys kept saying,
"Hey, you, boy," that was me?

226
00:12:03,374 --> 00:12:07,310
- I was the boy?
- Sounds like it.

227
00:12:07,411 --> 00:12:09,572
Have you told your dad
you don't want to go to that school?

228
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,207
I'm thinking of just going. I mean,
the graduates go on to do great things.

229
00:12:15,686 --> 00:12:18,450
I suppose, but that means we won't
be going to the same high school.

230
00:12:18,556 --> 00:12:21,320
Man, it just keeps getting worse.

231
00:12:21,425 --> 00:12:24,223
- But he's my Dad.
I don't want to disappoint him.
- Man.

232
00:12:24,328 --> 00:12:27,627
You and I are so different.
It's like we're not even related.

233
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,161
That'd be amazing.

234
00:12:33,671 --> 00:12:35,798
Oh, my God.

235
00:12:37,275 --> 00:12:40,244
<i>- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, Dad.</i>

236
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:43,074
I'm sorry that I'm so late,
but I was with Jessie.

237
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,081
This girl's making some serious progress
in getting you into that school.

238
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:48,845
She just booked Gob a gig
at Earl Milford's nursing home.

239
00:12:48,953 --> 00:12:51,080
- You're gonna be a shoo-in.
- Oh.

240
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:53,918
She's kinda something, isn't she?

241
00:12:54,025 --> 00:12:56,323
Yeah, I guess.

242
00:12:56,427 --> 00:13:00,261
I mean, you know, hey,
she is no replacement for your mom.

243
00:13:00,364 --> 00:13:02,389
- Oh, no. No way.
- Not at all.

244
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,765
- She's just working for us.
You're not dating her.
- No, I am not dating her.

245
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,770
Absolutely not dating her.

246
00:13:07,872 --> 00:13:10,773
just you and me.
The Bluth boys.

247
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:13,105
Bluth boys.

248
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,440
- Good night, buddy.
- Good night.

249
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,278
- Hey.
- Hey.

250
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:26,288
- Is he in bed?
- He's on his way.

251
00:13:27,591 --> 00:13:29,491
Hey, listen, listen,
listen, listen.

252
00:13:29,593 --> 00:13:34,690
This might be moving
a little bit too fast for him.

253
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:37,029
I mean for... for us.

254
00:13:37,134 --> 00:13:39,466
Me. Uh, for me.

255
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,970
Maybe we should
take a step back...

256
00:13:42,073 --> 00:13:44,200
and just keep
this relationship professional.

257
00:13:44,308 --> 00:13:48,210
- Oh, I think that would take all the fun out of it.
- No. Seriously, seriously.

258
00:13:48,312 --> 00:13:50,473
You're amazing...

259
00:13:50,581 --> 00:13:53,311
- but I just think we should slow down.
- Uh-huh.

260
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:57,148
So the two months on the bike,
that was, what, for my health?

261
00:13:57,254 --> 00:13:59,085
We had great conversations.

262
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:02,489
- Seriously, this is hard for me.
- This is hard for me too.

263
00:14:02,593 --> 00:14:06,859
I've got a life to get on track,
and I don't like wasting time, so let's do this.

264
00:14:06,964 --> 00:14:09,558
Let's take two steps back...

265
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:11,999
and why don't you find yourself
a new publicist.

266
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:17,502
jessie.

267
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:23,205
No. I was just saying your name
as you walked away. I didn't...

268
00:14:24,782 --> 00:14:27,444
I have no follow-up.

269
00:14:28,552 --> 00:14:31,077
Jessie.

270
00:14:31,188 --> 00:14:33,088
<i>Michael felt bad...</i>

271
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:36,353
<i>- but he felt even worse
when he got a call from his brother.
- Hello.</i>

272
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,519
It's Gob. I'm looking forJessie.

273
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:41,928
- She just left. What's wrong?
- I need her to spin something for me.

274
00:14:42,032 --> 00:14:43,932
Well, that's too bad
because I think she quit.

275
00:14:44,034 --> 00:14:46,594
- What do you need her to spin?
- Murder.

276
00:14:52,378 --> 00:14:54,369
<i>Michael was summoned to help his brother.</i>

277
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,677
- Murder, huh? Who died?
- My career.

278
00:14:57,783 --> 00:15:00,547
- I'm going to go home now.
- I lost a guy.

279
00:15:01,854 --> 00:15:04,118
I put him in the Aztec Tomb,
and he disappeared.

280
00:15:04,223 --> 00:15:06,350
- Isn't that the point?
- This will ruin me.

281
00:15:06,459 --> 00:15:09,189
- He's probably fine. He just escaped.
- No! I need Jessie!

282
00:15:09,295 --> 00:15:12,093
Well, she quit when I told her
that I couldn't go out with her.

283
00:15:12,198 --> 00:15:14,098
You know, I have to do
the right thing for my son.

284
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,728
Then you better get her back
because the guy I lost was Earl Milford.

285
00:15:18,838 --> 00:15:22,706
- What?
- I didn't know it was him.

286
00:15:22,808 --> 00:15:24,969
Although he was
spectacularly quiet in there.

287
00:15:25,077 --> 00:15:27,272
You can always tell a Milford man.

288
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:30,213
Gob, have you destroyed my chance
at getting my son in that school?

289
00:15:30,316 --> 00:15:32,546
Not with the right spin.

290
00:15:33,886 --> 00:15:37,822
jessie. Get her back.

291
00:15:37,923 --> 00:15:40,551
<i>Charged with the task
of renewing his medical license...</i>

292
00:15:40,659 --> 00:15:44,493
<i>Tobias was enjoying his first acting class
with Carl Weathers.</i>

293
00:15:44,597 --> 00:15:47,828
I don't know what your police captain
told you about me...

294
00:15:47,933 --> 00:15:50,800
but I'm a different breed of cop.

295
00:15:50,903 --> 00:15:54,395
<i>I'm from the streets,
and I'm the last cop...</i>

296
00:15:54,507 --> 00:15:57,442
you're ever gonna wanna
mess with in a darkened alley.

297
00:15:57,543 --> 00:16:01,843
Dark alley. And l...

298
00:16:01,947 --> 00:16:04,006
Listen, Mr. Weathers,
I don't know.

299
00:16:04,116 --> 00:16:06,016
Perhaps my wife was right.

300
00:16:06,118 --> 00:16:09,554
I don't know if I'm cut out to be a...
a De Niro...

301
00:16:09,655 --> 00:16:13,182
or a Regis or a Pinkett-Smith
or what have you.

302
00:16:13,292 --> 00:16:15,192
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Tobias.

303
00:16:15,294 --> 00:16:18,161
Dreams are worth fighting for.

304
00:16:18,264 --> 00:16:22,928
<i>Now, are you gonna be a fighter,
or are you gonna be a doctor?</i>

305
00:16:23,035 --> 00:16:25,026
You're right, Carl Weathers.

306
00:16:25,137 --> 00:16:28,834
I should just march into that restaurant
where my wife works and tell her...

307
00:16:28,941 --> 00:16:31,102
Your wife works in a restaurant?
Do they get a shift meal...

308
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:34,008
or do they just pay half-price
on select menu items?

309
00:16:34,113 --> 00:16:38,209
- I don't know.
- Well, let's find out, man.

310
00:16:38,317 --> 00:16:40,285
<i>And the press got hold of Gob's story.</i>

311
00:16:40,386 --> 00:16:44,083
- Where is Earl Milford?
- l... I don't know, all right?

312
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:46,385
I put him in a box.
I didn't kill him, all right?

313
00:16:46,492 --> 00:16:49,052
And don't edit this for your broadcast
so it looks like I'm screaming...

314
00:16:49,161 --> 00:16:50,788
"I killed Earl Milford."

315
00:16:50,896 --> 00:16:53,126
Startling confession,
tonight at 11:00.

316
00:16:53,232 --> 00:16:56,292
<i>Minutes later, Gob unloaded his equipment...</i>

317
00:16:56,402 --> 00:16:58,666
<i>and made a surprising discovery.</i>

318
00:17:03,476 --> 00:17:08,038
Don't send me back.
They abuse us. It's not pleasant.

319
00:17:08,147 --> 00:17:10,047
Earl, I have to take you back.

320
00:17:10,149 --> 00:17:14,051
- It's the only way to clear my name.
- You'll have a new name:

321
00:17:14,153 --> 00:17:18,055
- Hero.
- Hero.

322
00:17:18,157 --> 00:17:20,182
That could work for me.

323
00:17:20,292 --> 00:17:23,090
<i>Meanwhile, Jessie decided
to pay George Michael a visit.</i>

324
00:17:23,195 --> 00:17:25,425
Hi, George Michael.
Proud of yourself?

325
00:17:25,531 --> 00:17:27,863
Yeah. I got a bum away from the stand
without hurting his feelings.

326
00:17:27,967 --> 00:17:30,367
<i>- That was pretty sweet.
- No. I mean about your father.</i>

327
00:17:30,469 --> 00:17:32,835
About denying him
his chance to be happy.

328
00:17:32,938 --> 00:17:35,771
You're into that too?
I'm rubbing off on you, huh?

329
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:38,002
No. I want my dad to be happy.

330
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:40,271
It's too late now.
I've seen to that.

331
00:17:40,379 --> 00:17:43,439
Daddy lost his shot at happy,
and it's all your fault, Opie.

332
00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:46,916
<i>Jessie had gone too far,
and she had best watch her mouth.</i>

333
00:17:47,019 --> 00:17:49,783
Michael's about to become
the most unlikable man in town.

334
00:17:49,889 --> 00:17:52,915
Check the papers.

335
00:17:53,025 --> 00:17:55,619
She kind of reminds me of my mother.

336
00:17:55,728 --> 00:17:58,196
<i>And later that night,
Lindsay was working at Rud.</i>

337
00:17:58,297 --> 00:18:02,028
You seem like a man of taste and class.

338
00:18:02,134 --> 00:18:04,602
I'll give you $2,000 to touch me.

339
00:18:04,703 --> 00:18:07,206
Oh, my God. My husband.

340
00:18:07,206 --> 00:18:08,571
Oh, my God. My husband.

341
00:18:08,674 --> 00:18:11,507
You're married to Carl Weathers?

342
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:14,340
What's going on? Why are you here?
Why aren't you in Boston?

343
00:18:14,446 --> 00:18:18,815
- Who's he?
- His name is Carl Weathers,
and he's my new acting teacher.

344
00:18:18,918 --> 00:18:22,718
And, Lindsay, he's teaching me
all these valuable life lessons.

345
00:18:22,821 --> 00:18:26,257
- I buy all my cars at police auction.
- He's full of stuff like that.

346
00:18:26,358 --> 00:18:30,852
And, Lindsay, he's teaching me
to follow my dreams.

347
00:18:32,464 --> 00:18:35,365
Give me a bourbon.

348
00:18:35,467 --> 00:18:38,061
Any room on that tab
for me to jump on?

349
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:40,070
<i>And Michael caught up with Jessie.</i>

350
00:18:40,172 --> 00:18:42,072
Listen, thanks for coming.

351
00:18:42,174 --> 00:18:44,165
I was just...
I was doing some thinking.

352
00:18:44,276 --> 00:18:46,403
You know, I pulled away,
and that was wrong.

353
00:18:46,512 --> 00:18:49,970
- I really want to make this work.
- Get away from my son!

354
00:18:50,082 --> 00:18:52,448
Hey, Mom.
Kind of on a date here.

355
00:18:52,551 --> 00:18:55,418
You'll change your mind after this.

356
00:18:55,521 --> 00:19:00,788
<i>And Michael saw the story
thatJessie had planted.</i>

357
00:19:00,893 --> 00:19:03,760
<i>Let me tell you something, sweetie.</i>

358
00:19:03,862 --> 00:19:05,921
We may pick on each other,
get into little scrapes...

359
00:19:06,031 --> 00:19:08,829
call each other names and
occasionally steal from each other...

360
00:19:08,934 --> 00:19:10,993
but that's because we're a family.

361
00:19:11,103 --> 00:19:12,832
You have no right.
You don't get to do that.

362
00:19:12,938 --> 00:19:15,771
"Lindsay's a combative,
entitled princess"?

363
00:19:15,874 --> 00:19:17,899
I should hire somebody
to kick your ass for that.

364
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:20,274
- Save your money.
- Yeah, you're right. I'll do it myself.

365
00:19:20,379 --> 00:19:24,315
Hey, whoa! We are not settling things
like that anymore, all right?

366
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:28,318
- I don't need my son reading about us
in the paper.
- Oh, you and your son.

367
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,479
Stop using him as an excuse
for everything you do.

368
00:19:30,589 --> 00:19:33,387
- I saw him today. He's fine with us.
- What? You saw him today?

369
00:19:33,492 --> 00:19:35,722
Yeah. I told him he was getting
in the way of your happiness.

370
00:19:35,828 --> 00:19:38,296
You did?
You said that to my son?

371
00:19:38,397 --> 00:19:39,625
Yeah.

372
00:19:41,967 --> 00:19:44,094
You're on your own.
Ladies?

373
00:19:48,841 --> 00:19:50,741
<i>Food fight!</i>

374
00:19:52,978 --> 00:19:55,344
<i>What are you doing?</i>

375
00:19:55,447 --> 00:19:58,473
<i>Oh, my face!</i>

376
00:19:58,584 --> 00:20:01,917
<i>I'm gonna get you guys!
Stop!</i>

377
00:20:02,021 --> 00:20:04,512
<i>The press is having a love affair...</i>

378
00:20:04,623 --> 00:20:06,955
with hating the Bluth family...

379
00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:10,495
and they were the center
of another brawl this evening.

380
00:20:10,596 --> 00:20:14,191
I'm looking at $50,000 worth
of medical bills here.

381
00:20:14,299 --> 00:20:17,325
It looks like you won't be getting into
this school. Are you disappointed?

382
00:20:17,436 --> 00:20:19,768
Well, are you disappointed?

383
00:20:19,872 --> 00:20:23,399
Look, George Michael, I want you
to tell me how you feel, okay?

384
00:20:23,509 --> 00:20:25,739
I don't want you to worry so much
about hurting my feelings.

385
00:20:25,844 --> 00:20:29,245
I didn't want to go to that school,
and Jessie's a psycho.

386
00:20:30,449 --> 00:20:32,349
That could've saved us
a little bit of time.

387
00:20:32,451 --> 00:20:35,511
But, Dad, if you ever want to date
anyone else, that's fine with me.

388
00:20:35,621 --> 00:20:38,749
Yeah? Thanks, buddy.

389
00:20:38,857 --> 00:20:43,294
- 'Cause you know, I mean,
four women, that is kind of sad.
- All right. Thank you.

390
00:20:43,395 --> 00:20:46,057
I know you got married in college,
but that was your sophomore year.

391
00:20:46,165 --> 00:20:48,759
- You had your whole freshman year to...
- That's enough honesty for now.

392
00:20:48,867 --> 00:20:52,200
- Thank you. Good night.
- There must have been girls at parties.

393
00:20:53,539 --> 00:20:55,530
<i>On the next
Arrested Development.</i>

394
00:20:55,641 --> 00:20:57,575
<i>Gob holds a press conference
ofhis own.</i>

395
00:20:57,676 --> 00:21:00,236
And, now, prepare
to call me "hero."

396
00:21:03,849 --> 00:21:05,817
He's resting, so...
Oh.

397
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:08,910
Pick a card.
Oh, boy.

398
00:21:09,021 --> 00:21:11,489
<i>And Buster moves
to the kitchen.</i>
