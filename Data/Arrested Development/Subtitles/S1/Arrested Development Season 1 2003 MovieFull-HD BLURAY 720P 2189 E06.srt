1
00:00:01,164 --> 00:00:04,099
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,430
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:06,536 --> 00:00:08,697
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:14,277 --> 00:00:16,006
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

5
00:00:21,184 --> 00:00:24,176
<i>Michael Bluth
always rode his bike to work...</i>

6
00:00:24,287 --> 00:00:26,847
<i>but the recent heat wave had
taken some of the fun out of it.</i>

7
00:00:28,024 --> 00:00:30,151
<i>It had also caused problems...</i>

8
00:00:30,259 --> 00:00:32,955
<i>in his presentation to
the Bluth Company investors.</i>

9
00:00:33,062 --> 00:00:35,758
There's no screwups
with the permits this time?

10
00:00:35,865 --> 00:00:38,095
The permits have been filed
absolutely on time.

11
00:00:38,201 --> 00:00:40,032
You have my word on that.

12
00:00:42,405 --> 00:00:44,532
Um, I'll tell you what.

13
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,370
Let me get some of this, uh...

14
00:00:47,477 --> 00:00:49,968
Well, as you can...
The important part is here.

15
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,104
- Bye, you guys. Really great to see you again.
- Bye.

16
00:00:56,118 --> 00:00:58,245
They think you're full of...

17
00:00:58,354 --> 00:01:01,653
- I think it's the sweating.
- I've gotta get a car.

18
00:01:01,757 --> 00:01:04,089
Don't worry.
I told them the truth.

19
00:01:04,193 --> 00:01:06,753
- That I rode here on a bike?
- That the permits weren't filed.

20
00:01:06,863 --> 00:01:10,663
But my dad filed the permits
before he went to jail.

21
00:01:10,766 --> 00:01:13,166
He most certainly did not.

22
00:01:13,269 --> 00:01:15,328
So, I just lied
to the investors?

23
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:17,906
- You most certainly did.
- That's really great.

24
00:01:18,007 --> 00:01:20,999
Now I gotta ride my bike out to
the prison and talk to my dad about this.

25
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,907
That'll be fun
in 100-degree heat.

26
00:01:23,012 --> 00:01:25,173
Why don't you take
your dad's car?

27
00:01:25,281 --> 00:01:29,115
No. Dad would never go for that.

28
00:01:29,218 --> 00:01:33,018
No, no, no, no.
There's no ice cream in the car.

29
00:01:33,122 --> 00:01:36,285
- I'll be careful.
- All right. This is what we're gonna do.

30
00:01:36,392 --> 00:01:38,417
Careful, Michael.

31
00:01:41,597 --> 00:01:44,088
Oh.

32
00:01:47,103 --> 00:01:49,003
<i>- Whatever you think.
- Yeah.</i>

33
00:01:49,105 --> 00:01:51,596
But I did see Gob
driving it last week.

34
00:01:51,707 --> 00:01:54,437
<i>Wait. Honestly,
Gob's driving the car?</i>

35
00:01:54,544 --> 00:01:57,172
I'm not the liar.

36
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,010
<i>Michael needed his father's car...</i>

37
00:02:00,116 --> 00:02:02,414
<i>so he went to confront
his brother Gob.</i>

38
00:02:02,518 --> 00:02:05,146
- Give me a Gob.
- Gob!

39
00:02:05,254 --> 00:02:07,188
No, I didn't mean for you
to yell my name at me.

40
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,190
It's what I call a double-dipped banana
with everything on it.

41
00:02:09,292 --> 00:02:12,489
<i>Hey, I can't believe you.
I asked you two weeks ago...</i>

42
00:02:12,595 --> 00:02:15,029
whether we should use Dad's car,
and you said it would be bad form.

43
00:02:15,131 --> 00:02:19,568
- Now I hear you're driving it.
- That is a lie, a bold-faced lie!

44
00:02:19,669 --> 00:02:22,832
<i>Gob was lying.
He had been driving his father's car.</i>

45
00:02:37,186 --> 00:02:39,154
Why don't you just take
your precious, portable...

46
00:02:39,255 --> 00:02:42,156
stairway vehicle you're always trying
to convince us is a car?

47
00:02:42,258 --> 00:02:44,351
Yeah, that would be great,
except our brother-in-law...

48
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,360
left it in
an airport parking lot.

49
00:02:46,462 --> 00:02:48,157
From whence it came, huh?

50
00:02:48,264 --> 00:02:51,495
<i>In fact, Tobias had intended
to park the family's only vehicle...</i>

51
00:02:51,601 --> 00:02:53,501
<i>at the airport parking lot...</i>

52
00:02:53,603 --> 00:02:56,697
<i>but was waved on
to the tarmac instead...</i>

53
00:02:56,806 --> 00:02:59,104
<i>where he found a spot
close to his gate.</i>

54
00:03:01,444 --> 00:03:03,935
Here you go, Uncle Gob.
I had to use two sticks...

55
00:03:04,046 --> 00:03:05,980
to support all
the extra chocolate and nuts.

56
00:03:06,082 --> 00:03:08,573
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Whoa.
Two sticks and extra chocolate?

57
00:03:08,684 --> 00:03:10,777
Is it Mardi Gras?
What are you charging for that?

58
00:03:10,886 --> 00:03:13,514
- He doesn't like to discuss money.
- I don't like to discuss money.

59
00:03:13,623 --> 00:03:17,115
- You don't pay for it?
- A Bluth banana? No, I hadn't planned on it.

60
00:03:17,226 --> 00:03:19,091
But I'll tell you what...
if you want to use my likeness...

61
00:03:19,195 --> 00:03:21,095
for a Hamburglar-type character...

62
00:03:21,197 --> 00:03:23,757
I'll sign off on that,
Mr. Banana-Grabber.

63
00:03:23,866 --> 00:03:26,892
No, no, no, no, no. No more banana grabbing.
No more car grabbing.

64
00:03:27,003 --> 00:03:30,302
- Throw that away, please.
- But it's already made.

65
00:03:30,406 --> 00:03:32,636
I don't care.
Nobody gets it now, okay?

66
00:03:34,143 --> 00:03:38,580
- Are you happy?
- My own brother, Michael.

67
00:03:39,782 --> 00:03:42,148
My own selfish brother.

68
00:03:44,086 --> 00:03:45,986
- Michael.
- All right.

69
00:03:48,557 --> 00:03:51,754
I do not want you to get upset.
He did not mean that.

70
00:03:51,861 --> 00:03:54,728
- Sometimes he says...
- Selfish Michael.

71
00:03:59,502 --> 00:04:01,834
He did not mean that either.

72
00:04:01,937 --> 00:04:05,270
<i>Michael then went to his sister
to find his father's car.</i>

73
00:04:05,374 --> 00:04:07,103
What car? I don't know
what you're talking about.

74
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:10,007
Dad's car. The one you
didn't tell me that you had...

75
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:12,774
even though I had to ride
my bicycle to work all week.

76
00:04:12,882 --> 00:04:14,850
Oh, Dad's car.

77
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:17,646
Well, obviously, I'm gonna use it
if it's an emergency.

78
00:04:17,753 --> 00:04:20,654
<i>Lindsay had such an emergency
three days earlier...</i>

79
00:04:20,756 --> 00:04:24,522
<i>when her salon was able to squeeze
her in at the last moment.</i>

80
00:04:25,594 --> 00:04:28,427
That color's discontinued!

81
00:04:28,531 --> 00:04:30,999
I have to get ready
for the bachelorette auction.

82
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,227
The bachelorette auction?
You know you're married.

83
00:04:33,335 --> 00:04:35,530
<i>You just go to dinner with the guy.
It's for charity.</i>

84
00:04:35,638 --> 00:04:38,766
That's what you said about posing
for the Ladies of Literacy Calendar.

85
00:04:38,874 --> 00:04:41,638
The one with the pictures of all
the 30-year-old women in lingerie...

86
00:04:41,744 --> 00:04:44,907
<i>with their nipples covered
by copies of Oliver Twist.</i>

87
00:04:45,014 --> 00:04:47,073
Yeah, that made a big difference
for the young ones.

88
00:04:47,183 --> 00:04:49,447
It would have if it didn't
get banned from the schools.

89
00:04:49,552 --> 00:04:52,043
Come on, face it. You do all this
charity crap just to stroke your ego.

90
00:04:52,154 --> 00:04:54,054
You don't even know
what the auction's for tonight.

91
00:04:54,156 --> 00:04:57,614
- The wetlands.
- To do what with them?

92
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:00,127
- Dry them.
- Save them.

93
00:05:00,229 --> 00:05:02,663
From drying. Which is more
than you would ever do.

94
00:05:02,765 --> 00:05:04,960
You're, like, the least
charitable person I know.

95
00:05:06,068 --> 00:05:08,093
I don't do
anything for myself.

96
00:05:08,204 --> 00:05:10,172
Everything that I do
is for this family.

97
00:05:10,272 --> 00:05:12,172
<i>Oh, you don't do it
for us, Michael.</i>

98
00:05:12,274 --> 00:05:14,674
You just do it because you love
being the guy in charge.

99
00:05:14,777 --> 00:05:19,840
Cause you love saying no, like you said
to Gob when he wanted a frozen banana.

100
00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:23,316
And even after he gave you the rights
to his Mr. Banana-Grabber character.

101
00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:26,980
You know what? I will start doing my
charity work when you start doing yours.

102
00:05:27,089 --> 00:05:30,149
In the meantime, where's the car?

103
00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:32,659
I think Buster has it.
I don't know. It's on the schedule.

104
00:05:32,762 --> 00:05:35,993
There is a schedule?

105
00:05:36,098 --> 00:05:40,501
I always try so hard
not to look at this thing.

106
00:05:40,603 --> 00:05:42,838
<i>- So Michael went to find Buster.
- Who let you in?</i>

107
00:05:42,838 --> 00:05:43,736
<i>- So Michael went to find Buster.
- Who let you in?</i>

108
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:46,364
<i>Your new cleaning woman.
What happened to Luz?</i>

109
00:05:46,475 --> 00:05:49,911
Supposedly, Luz had to take
her daughter to the hospital.

110
00:05:50,012 --> 00:05:51,912
That's Lupe, her sister.

111
00:05:52,014 --> 00:05:55,450
- God, I hope she's okay.
- She's awful. Can barely wash a dish.

112
00:05:55,551 --> 00:06:00,887
Uh-oh. She better not walk through here
after she's been in there.

113
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,691
<i>- Tell me you've got an exit strategy.
- Mother.</i>

114
00:06:02,691 --> 00:06:04,386
<i>- Tell me you've got an exit strategy.
- Mother.</i>

115
00:06:04,493 --> 00:06:08,520
Oh, please. They didn't sneak
into this country to be your friends.

116
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:11,895
Wow.

117
00:06:12,001 --> 00:06:14,595
Don't you judge me.
You're the selfish one.

118
00:06:14,703 --> 00:06:18,696
You're the one who charged his own
brother for a Bluth frozen banana.

119
00:06:18,808 --> 00:06:20,708
<i>I mean,
it's one banana, Michael.</i>

120
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,869
<i>What could it cost, $ 10?</i>

121
00:06:22,978 --> 00:06:25,879
You've never actually set foot
in a supermarket, have you?

122
00:06:25,981 --> 00:06:27,608
I don't have time for this.

123
00:06:27,716 --> 00:06:29,707
I've got to get ready
for the bachelorette auction.

124
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:32,617
You're doing that? You can't possibly
tell me that you care about the wetlands.

125
00:06:32,721 --> 00:06:36,919
I care about going for more money
than Lucille Austero.

126
00:06:37,026 --> 00:06:39,824
<i>In fact, Lucille Bluth
had made sure of that.</i>

127
00:06:39,929 --> 00:06:43,296
<i>- Lucille!
- I got you tickets to The Producers.</i>

128
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:46,129
I already saw it
in New York.

129
00:06:46,235 --> 00:06:51,332
But that's of no use to a woman whose vertigo
makes flying a grotesque misadventure.

130
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,399
You must have scrimped
and saved for these.

131
00:06:55,511 --> 00:06:58,241
But isn't this
the night of the auction?

132
00:06:58,347 --> 00:07:00,975
- Is it?
- You seem pretty confident.

133
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,983
Oh, I think there's
a certain bachelor...

134
00:07:03,085 --> 00:07:05,747
who won't mind coming home
with me at the end of the evening.

135
00:07:05,855 --> 00:07:09,154
- Buster.
- Where did he go?

136
00:07:09,258 --> 00:07:11,749
Buster!

137
00:07:11,861 --> 00:07:14,489
<i>Why do you hide
every time the doorbell rings?</i>

138
00:07:14,597 --> 00:07:18,089
<i>I'm not hiding.
- Buster was hiding
from Lucille Austero.</i>

139
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:22,432
<i>After inadvertently flirting with her at
a social event while not wearing his glasses...</i>

140
00:07:22,538 --> 00:07:24,904
<i>Lucille had been
pursuing him ever since.</i>

141
00:07:25,007 --> 00:07:27,635
Buster, hi. It's me again.

142
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:31,975
<i>I've still got those Producers tickets,
and I'd love to share them with you.</i>

143
00:07:32,081 --> 00:07:35,710
<i>I don't want you to think
I'm taking this more seriously than you...</i>

144
00:07:35,818 --> 00:07:39,982
"are and unless you're planning
some grand romantic gesture...

145
00:07:40,089 --> 00:07:43,525
my feelings are just
the teensiest bit hurt."

146
00:07:43,626 --> 00:07:46,390
- What are you going to do?
- Bid on you.

147
00:07:46,495 --> 00:07:48,292
- How much?
- Ten thousand dollars.

148
00:07:48,397 --> 00:07:50,297
- When?
- When they call my name.

149
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:54,130
No, they're not going to call your name.
They're going to call my name.

150
00:07:54,236 --> 00:07:58,036
<i>Good grief.</i>

151
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:01,735
Hey, Busty.
You been using Dad's car?

152
00:08:01,844 --> 00:08:04,540
No. Uh, well, yes.

153
00:08:04,647 --> 00:08:08,481
- You got the keys?
- Uh, probably in my school pants.

154
00:08:08,584 --> 00:08:11,485
- Okay.
- I have been a part of this archeological dig.

155
00:08:11,587 --> 00:08:15,990
- Hmm.
- I think we found a part of a pterodactyl
under Fashion Island.

156
00:08:16,091 --> 00:08:18,719
Be careful.

157
00:08:19,762 --> 00:08:22,060
Oh!

158
00:08:22,164 --> 00:08:24,655
That was 90% gravity.

159
00:08:24,767 --> 00:08:27,497
It is my day on the schedule,
but I guess you get them first.

160
00:08:27,603 --> 00:08:30,834
- Yeah.
- Wait. I need my rape whistle back.

161
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,999
You got all your stuff out of the car?

162
00:08:33,108 --> 00:08:36,544
Yeah, I left my, um, homework in
the backseat, but I can get it later.

163
00:08:36,645 --> 00:08:38,875
- Okay.
- Okay.

164
00:08:38,981 --> 00:08:40,448
Help.

165
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:44,212
<i>Michael surveyed the damage
to his father's car...</i>

166
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,416
<i>the partially excavated skull,
the spilled nail polish...</i>

167
00:08:48,524 --> 00:08:51,721
<i>the burned seats... and he came to
an important decision.</i>

168
00:08:51,827 --> 00:08:55,126
Well, I'm getting some ice cream...
I can tell you that right now.

169
00:08:56,405 --> 00:08:59,203
<i>Michael, now able to drive to prison...</i>

170
00:08:59,308 --> 00:09:01,208
<i>confronted his father
about the permits.</i>

171
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:03,870
How come you didn't tell me
that you didn't file them?

172
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,108
I'm under a lot of pressure. I'm trying
to get my newsletter off the ground...

173
00:09:07,216 --> 00:09:11,050
and I'm trying to decide
which gang to align myself with.

174
00:09:11,153 --> 00:09:13,121
- Is it pledge week already?
- I've got it down to two...

175
00:09:13,222 --> 00:09:16,123
but, honestly, I just
don't even want to choose.

176
00:09:16,225 --> 00:09:20,559
I just feel... I feel like
the prettiest girl at the dance.

177
00:09:20,663 --> 00:09:23,188
Listen, about that permit thing,
that's an easy fix.

178
00:09:23,299 --> 00:09:26,496
just break into the permit office, slip
the application into the next file...

179
00:09:26,602 --> 00:09:29,230
then you tell them, you know,
"Hey, you guys screwed up."

180
00:09:29,338 --> 00:09:32,774
- I'm not doing that, Dad.
- Michael, you lied to your investors.

181
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:36,038
You gotta make that right.
Call Gob.

182
00:09:36,145 --> 00:09:38,739
He'll handle it. That's what...
That's what he's for.

183
00:09:38,848 --> 00:09:40,748
<i>That's what he's for.</i>

184
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:43,683
You better tell him I'm asking.
I don't think he's gonna do it for you...

185
00:09:43,786 --> 00:09:46,254
after you wouldn't even give him
a frozen banana, Michael?

186
00:09:46,355 --> 00:09:49,085
- What is there, a chat room that you guys...
- That's not charitable.

187
00:09:49,191 --> 00:09:51,921
Never mind. I'll tell Gob
that you want him to do this.

188
00:09:52,028 --> 00:09:55,088
- Okay. I got a dance I gotta get ready for.
- Whoa. There's really a dance?

189
00:09:55,197 --> 00:09:59,463
I don't know.
Both sides are making a lot of promises.

190
00:10:04,307 --> 00:10:06,867
You should call this
a Gob, guy.

191
00:10:11,647 --> 00:10:14,980
Gob, can I talk
to you for a sec?

192
00:10:15,084 --> 00:10:17,882
Listen, um, I'm really sorry
about before.

193
00:10:17,987 --> 00:10:20,956
I said some things,
and I got a little carried away.

194
00:10:21,057 --> 00:10:23,719
It's not the way you're
supposed to treat a brother...

195
00:10:23,826 --> 00:10:25,794
especially one
that I value so highly.

196
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:31,161
- Oh, I need a favor.
- That was subtle.

197
00:10:31,267 --> 00:10:33,929
- Did you just whistle?
- I had to buy a candied apple...

198
00:10:34,036 --> 00:10:36,504
when you denied me a banana, so, yeah,
I'm whistling.

199
00:10:36,605 --> 00:10:40,234
- Satisfied?
- It's not that noticeable. Listen.

200
00:10:40,343 --> 00:10:45,872
- Dad would like for you
to break into the permit office.
- Dad?

201
00:10:45,981 --> 00:10:48,347
- Dad said he wanted me for that?
- Yes, he did.

202
00:10:48,451 --> 00:10:52,581
- Will you do it?
- Maybe. I have some conditions.

203
00:10:53,622 --> 00:10:56,090
- Terms.
- Boy.

204
00:10:56,192 --> 00:10:58,160
- One condition and one term.
- All right.

205
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,820
- Let's have the condition first.
- Free banana whenever I want.

206
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:03,728
- Single dip.
- Double dip, but I'll take one stick.

207
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:06,063
- All right. What else?
- Creative control...

208
00:11:06,168 --> 00:11:08,636
spin-off rights
and theme park approval...

209
00:11:08,738 --> 00:11:11,036
for Mr. Banana-Grabber,
Baby Banana-Grabber...

210
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:14,234
and any other Banana-Grabber family
character that might emanate therefrom.

211
00:11:14,343 --> 00:11:17,176
I retain animation rights,
and we're gonna go back to single dip.

212
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,678
- Done.
- Great. What else?

213
00:11:18,781 --> 00:11:20,715
You humiliated me
in front of my nephew.

214
00:11:20,816 --> 00:11:22,875
I expect you to fix that.

215
00:11:22,985 --> 00:11:25,920
I want the respect
of your son.

216
00:11:26,021 --> 00:11:28,080
You better let me
do the talking.

217
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:31,455
<i>George Michael,
your uncle has a request.</i>

218
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,790
One Bluth banana,
George Michael.

219
00:11:33,896 --> 00:11:36,797
<i>Go ahead, give it to him.
Gob deserves your respect.</i>

220
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:41,336
And from now on, I want you to do
whatever he asks you to do, okay?

221
00:11:41,437 --> 00:11:47,376
After all, he is your uncle, and I think
we ought to just embrace that.

222
00:11:47,476 --> 00:11:51,537
- Thank you.
- Have I held up my end of the deal?

223
00:11:51,647 --> 00:11:53,615
I can't believe I gave you
animation rights.

224
00:11:53,716 --> 00:11:56,810
I hope that doesn't come back
and bite me in the ass.

225
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:59,387
<i>Meanwhile, Lindsay,
wanting to prove to Michael...</i>

226
00:11:59,488 --> 00:12:02,218
<i>that she was a charitable person,
joined a group of activists...</i>

227
00:12:02,324 --> 00:12:05,885
<i>dedicated to preserving
the wetlands.</i>

228
00:12:05,995 --> 00:12:08,896
Yeah. Hi.
I'm gonna need a taxi.

229
00:12:08,998 --> 00:12:13,059
I don't know if that smell
is you, the car...

230
00:12:13,169 --> 00:12:15,137
something you ate or
something you're about to eat...

231
00:12:15,237 --> 00:12:17,603
but my God, you're in
a service business!

232
00:12:20,676 --> 00:12:22,906
- Hello.
- I'm in the wetlands.

233
00:12:23,012 --> 00:12:25,139
I've got a poker thing,
and I'm gonna clean them up.

234
00:12:25,247 --> 00:12:27,943
So the next time you wanna
tell me that I'm uncharitable...

235
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:30,917
why don't you just ask yourself
who called you from the wetlands?

236
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,853
- Who is this?
- Nice try. You're the selfish one.

237
00:12:33,956 --> 00:12:37,551
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've got some nature to save.

238
00:12:42,264 --> 00:12:46,428
<i>While Lindsay was finding
it difficult to be truly charitable...</i>

239
00:12:46,535 --> 00:12:50,767
<i>Michael was looking for an opportunity
to rise to Lindsay's challenge...</i>

240
00:12:50,873 --> 00:12:54,809
<i>and that's when he recognized his mother's
fill-in housekeeper at a bus stop.</i>

241
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:57,470
Hello there.
You're not riding the bus today.

242
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:00,447
Get in this car. I'm not taking no
for an answer. Come on.

243
00:13:00,549 --> 00:13:02,449
Don't make me get out
of this car and put you in here myself.

244
00:13:02,551 --> 00:13:04,519
<i>- That's right. Here we go.
- Unfortunately, the woman he picked up...</i>

245
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,350
<i>wasn't Lupe,
but was a total stranger.</i>

246
00:13:07,456 --> 00:13:11,916
<i>And upon seeing bones, a shovel
and what appeared to be blood...</i>

247
00:13:13,162 --> 00:13:16,063
<i>she realized he wasn't
who she thought he was.</i>

248
00:13:16,165 --> 00:13:20,534
Mister, please.

249
00:13:20,636 --> 00:13:23,469
This is gonna be tricky.
I don't speak Spanish.

250
00:13:23,572 --> 00:13:26,006
<i>Yo "escared."</i>

251
00:13:26,108 --> 00:13:29,100
<i>- Uh-huh.
- "Izquierdo." I know that one.</i>

252
00:13:29,211 --> 00:13:34,012
Left turn it is, Mrs...
They call me selfish.

253
00:13:35,235 --> 00:13:37,829
<i>Michael thought he was
helping his mother's housekeeper...</i>

254
00:13:37,937 --> 00:13:41,031
<i>- but he had the wrong woman.
- I guess it would just be a guy who...</i>

255
00:13:41,141 --> 00:13:43,302
you know,
grabs bananas and runs...

256
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:46,709
or, uh, a banana
that grabs things.

257
00:13:46,813 --> 00:13:49,338
I don't know. Why would a banana
grab another banana?

258
00:13:49,449 --> 00:13:51,440
Those are the kind of questions
I don't wanna answer.

259
00:13:55,622 --> 00:13:59,114
- Hello.
- Oh, Michael, it's so beautiful here.

260
00:13:59,225 --> 00:14:02,626
<i>- You have to come down and see this.
- I'm a little busy right now.</i>

261
00:14:02,729 --> 00:14:04,629
I've got someone else
in the car with me...

262
00:14:04,731 --> 00:14:09,191
and I'm not going anywhere
until she's taken care of.

263
00:14:09,302 --> 00:14:12,294
Look, I screwed up, okay?

264
00:14:12,405 --> 00:14:15,374
I'm lost. And I hate them.
I hate the wetlands.

265
00:14:15,475 --> 00:14:18,706
They're stupid and wet,
and there are bugs everywhere.

266
00:14:18,812 --> 00:14:21,280
And I think I maced
a crane, Michael.

267
00:14:21,381 --> 00:14:24,316
Look, you've got Dad's car.
Why don't you come pick me up?

268
00:14:24,417 --> 00:14:28,353
<i>Crazy. Loco.</i>

269
00:14:29,589 --> 00:14:32,080
Listen, we gotta make
a little detour, okay?

270
00:14:32,192 --> 00:14:35,184
So I hope no one's
waiting for you.

271
00:14:35,295 --> 00:14:38,059
<i>In fact, the woman
Michael thought was Lupe...</i>

272
00:14:38,164 --> 00:14:40,155
<i>did have people waiting for her...</i>

273
00:14:40,266 --> 00:14:43,258
<i>and they had
reported her missing.</i>

274
00:14:45,371 --> 00:14:48,272
<i>The real Lupe, however,
was leaving Lucille's for the evening.</i>

275
00:14:48,374 --> 00:14:51,172
<i>Buster, l...</i>

276
00:14:51,277 --> 00:14:53,268
Oh.
Hello.

277
00:14:53,379 --> 00:14:56,075
It appears my
one-time admirer...

278
00:14:56,182 --> 00:15:00,414
is not planning some grand
romantic gesture after all.

279
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:04,012
You know what? It's his loss.

280
00:15:04,124 --> 00:15:07,355
It's his loss.
It's his loss!

281
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:11,123
<i>Gob, meanwhile,
was casing the permit office...</i>

282
00:15:11,231 --> 00:15:14,200
<i>following the first rule of surveillance...
never get noticed.</i>

283
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:18,532
Carrier Express.

284
00:15:18,638 --> 00:15:22,369
- Say, you're not our regular guy.
- No, I'm the substitute.

285
00:15:22,475 --> 00:15:26,138
Hey, Gary, get a picture of me
with the new whistling delivery guy.

286
00:15:26,246 --> 00:15:28,976
<i>Gob realized he needed a new plan.</i>

287
00:15:29,082 --> 00:15:31,414
So, I need you to give
your father a message for me.

288
00:15:31,518 --> 00:15:34,043
All right. You heard my dad.
I have to do whatever you ask me to.

289
00:15:34,154 --> 00:15:36,918
Right. I forgot about that.

290
00:15:37,023 --> 00:15:40,618
All right. Take this lock-pick set,
break into the permit office for me.

291
00:15:40,727 --> 00:15:43,059
- No, I think I better check with my dad first.
- Well...

292
00:15:43,163 --> 00:15:46,326
You're gonna break into a permit office?
Sweet. Can I come?

293
00:15:46,432 --> 00:15:49,492
<i>And George Michael
saw a chance to get closer to Maeby.</i>

294
00:15:49,602 --> 00:15:52,730
You know, my dad hates to micromanage.
Let's just do this.

295
00:15:54,274 --> 00:15:56,174
<i>And back at the wetlands...</i>

296
00:15:56,276 --> 00:15:58,176
<i>Lindsay finally
found her taxi.</i>

297
00:15:58,278 --> 00:16:02,374
Oh, good Lord.
You smell worse than before.

298
00:16:02,482 --> 00:16:06,111
<i>Oh, my God. It's me!
- And in her haste
to leave the wetlands...</i>

299
00:16:06,219 --> 00:16:08,346
<i>she forgot to call Michael.</i>

300
00:16:10,123 --> 00:16:15,026
Hey. Hey! Stay there. What are you doing?
Get in the car. Don't move.

301
00:16:16,763 --> 00:16:19,664
Lindsay! Linds!

302
00:16:19,766 --> 00:16:21,757
Come on.
I'm tired of looking.

303
00:16:21,868 --> 00:16:24,200
She's not here.

304
00:16:24,304 --> 00:16:27,637
She probably never was here.
She set me up.

305
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:30,937
This is probably all about the car.
I'm gonna kill her!

306
00:16:31,044 --> 00:16:34,138
Hey! Where are you going?
Hello!

307
00:16:35,982 --> 00:16:38,348
I'm trying to help you.

308
00:16:39,886 --> 00:16:41,786
You're welcome.

309
00:16:41,888 --> 00:16:43,788
<i>Meanwhile, Gob met with his father...</i>

310
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:46,017
<i>to discuss
the permit office break-in.</i>

311
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:50,061
So I say to Michael, "If it's so important to Dad,

312
00:16:50,163 --> 00:16:52,358
I'll look past your selfishness
and do it."

313
00:16:52,465 --> 00:16:56,731
There's a dentist in here who, uh,
took liberties with his patients.

314
00:16:56,836 --> 00:17:01,136
- I'm gonna ask him to look at
whatever is happening with you.
- Thanks, Pop.

315
00:17:01,241 --> 00:17:04,233
Hey, my stock is never gonna be higher
with his gang than it is right now.

316
00:17:04,344 --> 00:17:08,405
Yeah. So have you, uh, made a decision or...

317
00:17:08,514 --> 00:17:10,675
I don't know.
I thought I had it down to two...

318
00:17:10,783 --> 00:17:14,719
but then the Haitians
made this beautiful pitch.

319
00:17:14,821 --> 00:17:17,949
So, uh, any trouble
at the, uh, permit office?

320
00:17:18,057 --> 00:17:20,685
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- Easy.

321
00:17:20,793 --> 00:17:23,318
- I delegated, just like you taught me.
- Who'd you get?

322
00:17:23,429 --> 00:17:25,329
George Michael.

323
00:17:25,431 --> 00:17:27,331
- My grandson?
- Yeah.

324
00:17:28,668 --> 00:17:31,330
You got my 14-year-old
grandson to do this.

325
00:17:31,437 --> 00:17:33,530
Under 18 walks out clean.

326
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:39,510
Listen, um, there's a very strict
"no touching" policy here, but...

327
00:17:39,612 --> 00:17:43,241
Oh, what the hell.
It's worth a week in the hotbox.

328
00:17:43,349 --> 00:17:46,512
- No touching!
- You stupid ass.

329
00:17:46,619 --> 00:17:49,588
<i>And George Michael was successful...</i>

330
00:17:49,689 --> 00:17:51,782
<i>- with the lock pick Gob had given him.
- What are you doing?</i>

331
00:17:51,891 --> 00:17:53,859
We're supposed to put the form
in the wrong file.

332
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,860
I know. I'm just
leaving my calling card.

333
00:17:55,962 --> 00:17:57,725
I thought we didn't want
anyone to know we were here.

334
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:00,765
It's a little late for that.
Our fingerprints are everywhere.

335
00:18:00,867 --> 00:18:02,767
You said they weren't
gonna check for fingerprints.

336
00:18:02,869 --> 00:18:04,769
No. I said don't
wear your mittens.

337
00:18:04,871 --> 00:18:06,862
I didn't want you to look stupid
on the security camera.

338
00:18:06,973 --> 00:18:09,703
<i>- There's a security camera?
- Security breach...</i>

339
00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:11,709
Someone's coming. What do we do?

340
00:18:11,811 --> 00:18:14,041
I don't know.
I always get caught.

341
00:18:14,147 --> 00:18:16,513
Save yourself.
I'll take the hit.

342
00:18:16,616 --> 00:18:19,551
My record's clean.
I got my bike seat stolen once...

343
00:18:19,652 --> 00:18:21,847
but I don't think it counts
on your record if you're the victim.

344
00:18:21,954 --> 00:18:23,979
There is a record of this, but it's not like I'm...

345
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:26,957
Thanks. I'll take the rap next time
we do something like this, okay?

346
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:30,223
Next time.

347
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:33,561
<i>Hold it!</i>

348
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:36,260
<i>And Lindsay made it
to the Save the Wetlands auction...</i>

349
00:18:36,369 --> 00:18:38,064
<i>- with moments to spare.
- Hey, Mom.</i>

350
00:18:38,171 --> 00:18:40,401
Oh, honey.

351
00:18:40,506 --> 00:18:43,907
You're not supposed to show up
as the wetlands.

352
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:47,138
<i>While Lucille was waiting
for Buster to show up and bid on her...</i>

353
00:18:47,246 --> 00:18:49,510
<i>Buster was waiting for
the other Lucille to leave...</i>

354
00:18:49,615 --> 00:18:51,845
<i>for what he assumed
was The Producers...</i>

355
00:18:51,951 --> 00:18:54,818
<i>but was now, in fact,
the bachelorette auction.</i>

356
00:18:56,422 --> 00:18:58,822
<i>And Lindsay was finally
up for auction...</i>

357
00:18:58,925 --> 00:19:01,416
<i>which Michael arrived
just in time to see.</i>

358
00:19:01,527 --> 00:19:04,360
<i>What do I hear
for Lindsay Bluth?</i>

359
00:19:04,464 --> 00:19:07,763
<i>Gentlemen, it's a good cause.
- And as Michael
looked at his sister...</i>

360
00:19:07,867 --> 00:19:12,270
<i>uncertain whether her face was red
from embarrassment or the sun damage...</i>

361
00:19:12,372 --> 00:19:15,341
<i>it was clear she had been
in the wetlands that day.</i>

362
00:19:16,943 --> 00:19:19,810
One thousand.

363
00:19:19,912 --> 00:19:22,437
Seriously?

364
00:19:22,548 --> 00:19:28,111
Sold... to the man
who truly knows what charity is.

365
00:19:28,221 --> 00:19:33,158
- And now, ladies and gentlemen,
the lovely Lucille.
- Move! Move! Move! Move!

366
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:37,025
<i>- Who is the lucky bachelor...
- And Buster showed upjust in time...</i>

367
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:39,963
Ten thousand dollars!

368
00:19:40,066 --> 00:19:42,694
<i>- Buster!
- to bid on the wrong Lucille.</i>

369
00:19:42,802 --> 00:19:45,236
How grand!

370
00:19:45,338 --> 00:19:48,796
How terribly grand!

371
00:19:51,778 --> 00:19:56,306
Well, how embarrassing. My own
brother buying me? I'd rather die.

372
00:19:58,017 --> 00:20:01,145
Thank you.
Maybe you're not that selfish.

373
00:20:01,254 --> 00:20:04,348
You actually went out there.
I was impressed you gave it a shot.

374
00:20:04,457 --> 00:20:06,516
<i>Excuse me.
Is this your car?</i>

375
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,427
Yes. It's his.

376
00:20:09,529 --> 00:20:12,760
- You're under arrest...
- Ow! Ow!

377
00:20:12,865 --> 00:20:16,858
for the forced abduction
of Helen Maria Delgado.

378
00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:25,209
What'd you do?

379
00:20:25,311 --> 00:20:27,438
just trying to be a good guy.

380
00:20:27,547 --> 00:20:31,881
Me too. Me too.

381
00:20:31,984 --> 00:20:34,145
Let's go see Pop-Pop.

382
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:39,920
<i>On the next Arrested Development.</i>

383
00:20:40,026 --> 00:20:44,224
<i>Michael gets a lucky break when Helen
makes the same mistake that he did.</i>

384
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:46,025
<i>- Four. Cuatro.
- Four, step forward.</i>

385
00:20:50,703 --> 00:20:53,695
<i>And Gob kicks himself
for a bad business decision.</i>

386
00:20:53,806 --> 00:20:55,933
Look, a seagull!

387
00:20:56,042 --> 00:21:00,206
I never should've given up animation rights.
