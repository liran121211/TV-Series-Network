1
00:00:01,653 --> 00:00:04,850
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:04,956 --> 00:00:07,049
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:07,158 --> 00:00:09,217
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:14,766 --> 00:00:16,529
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

5
00:00:19,437 --> 00:00:21,871
The local colleges
are on spring break...

6
00:00:21,973 --> 00:00:24,533
and things are heating up
in Newport Beach.

7
00:00:24,643 --> 00:00:27,771
<i>George Michael was off
from school for two weeks...</i>

8
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:30,074
<i>and was enjoying spending time
with his uncle.</i>

9
00:00:30,181 --> 00:00:32,706
I'm intercepting
some telepathic energy...

10
00:00:32,817 --> 00:00:36,184
that's telling me
it's the eight of diamonds.

11
00:00:36,288 --> 00:00:39,018
That's amazingly close.

12
00:00:39,124 --> 00:00:41,615
Gee, I got it wrong. Well.

13
00:00:41,726 --> 00:00:44,194
I guess you won
the shirt off my back.

14
00:00:44,296 --> 00:00:47,788
- Okay, that's amazing.
- It's the queen of diamonds.

15
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:52,598
No, no, no. I had... But if that
had been the actual card...

16
00:00:52,704 --> 00:00:55,195
I'm pretty sure I'd be
almost too blown away.

17
00:00:55,307 --> 00:00:57,969
You know, it's a new trick, so I'm
still kind of tweaking my nipples...

18
00:00:58,076 --> 00:01:00,806
<i>- The presentation was great.
- Hey. Whoa!</i>

19
00:01:00,912 --> 00:01:03,142
What's going on here, huh? George
Michael, you should get to school.

20
00:01:03,248 --> 00:01:06,046
No, we're off for two weeks.
Gob's teaching me some new tricks.

21
00:01:06,151 --> 00:01:09,746
Spring break!
It's my favorite holiday.

22
00:01:09,854 --> 00:01:11,549
Nothing gets me more excited.

23
00:01:11,656 --> 00:01:13,783
I can see that.
You might wanna button that shirt up.

24
00:01:13,892 --> 00:01:16,588
No, I'm good.
Anyway, listen, Michael.

25
00:01:16,695 --> 00:01:18,595
I need the yacht.

26
00:01:18,697 --> 00:01:21,165
I kind of made a commitment.

27
00:01:21,266 --> 00:01:23,496
<i>One year earlier, Gob had appeared...</i>

28
00:01:23,601 --> 00:01:25,626
<i>on a youth-oriented
music network...</i>

29
00:01:25,737 --> 00:01:28,069
<i>Newport Beach."</i>

30
00:01:28,173 --> 00:01:30,607
Now that I've gotten
your attention...

31
00:01:30,709 --> 00:01:33,200
I'd like to announce
that one year from today...

32
00:01:33,311 --> 00:01:37,805
I shall make that
beautiful yacht disappear.

33
00:01:39,918 --> 00:01:41,749
<i>Wow. He's amazing.</i>

34
00:01:41,853 --> 00:01:45,311
He hasn't done it, and you're
holding a four of spades in your hand.

35
00:01:45,423 --> 00:01:47,687
I don't care.
I'm loving the ride, you know?

36
00:01:47,792 --> 00:01:50,818
- How are you gonna do it?
- Well, you've got two weeks off.

37
00:01:50,929 --> 00:01:53,193
You're about to find out.

38
00:01:53,298 --> 00:01:56,426
Maybe we'll meet a couple
young coeds along the way.

39
00:01:56,534 --> 00:02:00,766
- How young is too young for you?
- That's not gonna happen, okay?

40
00:02:00,872 --> 00:02:04,273
There's not gonna be any coeds. There
certainly isn't gonna be any magic.

41
00:02:04,376 --> 00:02:07,004
It is a path to a lonely life
where people mock you.

42
00:02:07,112 --> 00:02:10,104
- And you don't even realize it.
- Michael, I'm a magi...

43
00:02:10,215 --> 00:02:12,115
I see what you did.

44
00:02:12,217 --> 00:02:15,618
You're not dressed yet? I thought you
were working for me today at the office.

45
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,518
You guys stay open
during spring break?

46
00:02:18,623 --> 00:02:20,887
We're not Orthodox.
But don't worry about it.

47
00:02:20,992 --> 00:02:23,961
Kitty's coming back,
and it's just in time.

48
00:02:24,062 --> 00:02:26,997
Although she's caused nothing but
problems since she's worked for me.

49
00:02:27,098 --> 00:02:29,692
Kitty, isn't that your phone?

50
00:02:29,801 --> 00:02:32,395
<i>No, I'm on the phone with your dad.
That one's your line.</i>

51
00:02:34,472 --> 00:02:36,906
<i>Kitty, these are not the files I asked for.</i>

52
00:02:37,008 --> 00:02:41,672
Oh, then I don't know
what I shredded.

53
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,305
Have you had a chance
to type up that report yet?

54
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:48,079
- No, I have been Googling your father.
- So I've heard.

55
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:54,019
She's been out for two weeks
with this chest thing...

56
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:56,491
but she's had no problems cashing
the checks I've been sending her.

57
00:02:56,594 --> 00:02:58,755
Speaking of which,
have we gotten anything from Nana?

58
00:02:58,863 --> 00:03:01,229
Buster got a perforated heart
and Gob got that receding hairline...

59
00:03:01,332 --> 00:03:03,232
but you and I pretty much
dodged the bullet.

60
00:03:03,334 --> 00:03:06,497
No, I meant in the mail. She usually
sends checks for Maeby's birthday.

61
00:03:06,604 --> 00:03:09,937
There's been cash coming in?
Have you been holding out on me?

62
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:12,509
No. No, I've been investing it.

63
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,544
Let's face it.
I'm better with money than you are.

64
00:03:14,646 --> 00:03:18,377
- Better at spending it.
- Okay, I tell you what.

65
00:03:18,483 --> 00:03:21,714
I'll take you down to see Nana
if you split the money with me 60/40.

66
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,685
- 55/55.
- Deal.

67
00:03:23,788 --> 00:03:26,723
Sounds like you guys are
getting more than you think.

68
00:03:26,825 --> 00:03:29,191
We should go now
before your dad gets back.

69
00:03:29,294 --> 00:03:31,854
- No need going halfsies with him too.
- Right.

70
00:03:31,963 --> 00:03:34,022
<i>In fact, Tobias had gone to prison...</i>

71
00:03:34,132 --> 00:03:37,727
<i>to research the role of Frightened Inmate #2
for a film.</i>

72
00:03:37,836 --> 00:03:40,498
<i>This came at a bad time
for George Sr...</i>

73
00:03:40,605 --> 00:03:43,540
<i>who was in a conflict with a
prisoner named White Power Bill...</i>

74
00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:46,872
<i>a conflict Tobias
inadvertently helped him solve.</i>

75
00:03:46,978 --> 00:03:50,038
I sold you for
a pack of cigarettes.

76
00:03:50,148 --> 00:03:53,675
But didn't you come here
to research the nature of fear?

77
00:03:53,785 --> 00:03:55,912
I can't think of a better
teacher than White Power Bill.

78
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,716
He's like a master's course
unto himself.

79
00:03:58,823 --> 00:04:00,791
So you think I'm a coward.

80
00:04:02,327 --> 00:04:04,557
There's only one man
I've ever called "coward".

81
00:04:04,662 --> 00:04:06,596
That's Brian Doyle-Murray.

82
00:04:06,698 --> 00:04:09,462
<i>No.</i>

83
00:04:09,567 --> 00:04:12,229
What I'm calling you...

84
00:04:12,337 --> 00:04:14,498
is a television actor.

85
00:04:14,606 --> 00:04:16,233
Ouch.

86
00:04:16,341 --> 00:04:18,400
<i>And so, Tobias remained in prison...</i>

87
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,774
<i>as Lindsay and Maeby arrived at Nana's.</i>

88
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:23,074
Remember,
she's a very old woman.

89
00:04:23,181 --> 00:04:25,843
We're going to get in,
get the cash and get out.

90
00:04:27,852 --> 00:04:30,082
Is this who I think it is?

91
00:04:30,188 --> 00:04:32,315
Nana!

92
00:04:32,423 --> 00:04:36,120
<i>Unfortunately, the woman
who now lived there was not their Nana.</i>

93
00:04:36,227 --> 00:04:39,492
A fact that took Lindsay and Maeby
an hour and a half to ascertain.

94
00:04:39,597 --> 00:04:41,497
Go! Go! It's not her!
Drop the photo album!

95
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,499
- We're not in the photo album!
- Drop the pie!

96
00:04:46,204 --> 00:04:48,502
<i>And Michael arrived at work to find Kitty.</i>

97
00:04:48,606 --> 00:04:50,403
Hey, Kitty, how are you feeling?

98
00:04:50,508 --> 00:04:54,968
Much better.
Man, I was really stuffed up there!

99
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:58,014
Up here, Michael. Up here.

100
00:04:58,116 --> 00:05:01,643
Why'd you have to get sick now?
What was the rush?

101
00:05:01,753 --> 00:05:03,812
<i>In fact, it was
the previous year's spring break...</i>

102
00:05:03,922 --> 00:05:05,981
<i>that was responsible
for Kitty's rush...</i>

103
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:08,650
<i>when the makers
of the popular video series...</i>

104
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,491
<i>Girls With Low Self-Esteem,
chose not to include her.</i>

105
00:05:13,097 --> 00:05:15,725
<i>Okay, we got all the good stuffhere.</i>

106
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:20,793
Let's just say I'm looking forward
to a more successful spring break.

107
00:05:20,905 --> 00:05:24,238
- "Break"? You were just out.
- That was my sick leave.

108
00:05:24,342 --> 00:05:26,640
- This is vacation.
- No, you're not going on vacation.

109
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:29,042
<i>Oh, yes, I absolutely am!</i>

110
00:05:29,147 --> 00:05:32,310
If you need me,
I will be at Senor Tadpoles...

111
00:05:32,417 --> 00:05:34,681
- having a margarita made in my mouth.
- No, no. Hey.

112
00:05:34,786 --> 00:05:36,811
Kitty, there will be no
margarita in your mouth.

113
00:05:36,921 --> 00:05:39,754
Oh, yes, there absolutely will be
a margarita in my mouth!

114
00:05:39,857 --> 00:05:42,087
Spring break!

115
00:05:42,193 --> 00:05:44,889
- Up here, Michael. Up here.
- Put the shirt back down and keep on moving.

116
00:05:44,996 --> 00:05:47,487
You're fired.

117
00:05:47,599 --> 00:05:50,898
I work for your father. You don't have
the hiring and firing power.

118
00:05:51,002 --> 00:05:54,403
I absolutely do, and you're fired.

119
00:05:54,505 --> 00:05:59,135
I don't think your father is
gonna be very happy about this.

120
00:05:59,243 --> 00:06:01,768
But take a good look,
'cause it's the last time!

121
00:06:05,116 --> 00:06:07,016
That's the seventh nipple
I've seen today.

122
00:06:07,118 --> 00:06:09,313
<i>And Michael was called to the prison.</i>

123
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,445
<i>What are you doing firing Kitty?
You can't fire Kitty.</i>

124
00:06:11,556 --> 00:06:14,218
- First of all, you don't
have hiring and firing power.
- I do.

125
00:06:14,325 --> 00:06:17,021
- And I had to. She's crazy.
- That's why you don't fire her.

126
00:06:17,128 --> 00:06:19,358
You don't fire crazy.
You never fire crazy.

127
00:06:19,464 --> 00:06:22,490
Dad, she's incompetent.
She's completely unprofessional.

128
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:27,094
Look, she just came back from
sick leave, uh, with these...

129
00:06:27,205 --> 00:06:30,140
Oh, my God, you paid
for those, didn't you?

130
00:06:30,241 --> 00:06:34,075
You got carried away. Hell,
I've been so corrupted by my power...

131
00:06:34,178 --> 00:06:36,942
that I even enjoyed
firing my own twin brother.

132
00:06:37,048 --> 00:06:39,107
You should have seen his face
when he was begging me not to.

133
00:06:39,217 --> 00:06:41,185
Well, he's my twin brother.
I can show you.

134
00:06:47,692 --> 00:06:49,592
It was funny.
But, you know...

135
00:06:49,694 --> 00:06:52,254
Kitty had access
to all kinds of information.

136
00:06:52,363 --> 00:06:54,058
God knows what she poked
her nose into.

137
00:06:54,165 --> 00:06:56,827
There's enough evidence
on this boat to put me away.

138
00:06:56,934 --> 00:06:59,368
The only real thing
I have...

139
00:07:01,105 --> 00:07:03,903
Oh, God, there's nothing
to hold on to down there.

140
00:07:04,008 --> 00:07:05,999
- You're like a boy.
- What's wrong with you?

141
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:09,568
All these books are cooked!

142
00:07:11,282 --> 00:07:14,945
- I'm sorry. I gotta do my job.
- And I gotta get out of prison.

143
00:07:15,053 --> 00:07:17,578
Next time someone threatens me,
I may not have a son-in-law to offer.

144
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:19,816
I can't come in here
all the t... "Offer"?

145
00:07:19,924 --> 00:07:22,256
I may not have a son-in-law
to offer me counseling.

146
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,921
You know, he should have stayed a shrink.
He's very gifted, you know.

147
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:30,194
<i>In fact, Tobias had even
produced a videotape...</i>

148
00:07:30,301 --> 00:07:33,202
<i>but its brief success
was due to its misleading name.</i>

149
00:07:34,806 --> 00:07:38,264
<i>Once this was discovered,
all but 10 of the videos were returned.</i>

150
00:07:38,376 --> 00:07:41,709
Hire Kitty back, okay?
For the company. No, no.

151
00:07:43,848 --> 00:07:47,147
For me, Michael.

152
00:07:47,251 --> 00:07:50,379
- It is kind of a funny face.
- Oh, come on, now.

153
00:07:55,492 --> 00:07:59,929
There's just absolutely no purse
that will go with this outfit.

154
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:02,294
You've got a little pocket
there, Annyong.

155
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,832
<i>Annyong.</i>

156
00:08:03,934 --> 00:08:05,834
That's not getting old.

157
00:08:05,936 --> 00:08:09,201
- Where's Nana?
- I sent her on a wonderful cruise.

158
00:08:09,306 --> 00:08:11,206
You just missed
a wonderful call from her.

159
00:08:11,308 --> 00:08:15,506
She just came back from a wonderful
costume party that the captain threw.

160
00:08:15,612 --> 00:08:18,080
She gained 10 pounds...
there's so much food on that boat.

161
00:08:18,181 --> 00:08:20,274
She's up to 74!

162
00:08:20,383 --> 00:08:22,510
It's wonderful, just wonderful.

163
00:08:22,619 --> 00:08:26,646
<i>In fact, Lucille's mother
had been dead for six months.</i>

164
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:29,157
She tried pesto
for the first time.

165
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,454
Can you believe that?

166
00:08:31,561 --> 00:08:34,928
Ninety-two years old,
and she never tried pesto.

167
00:08:35,031 --> 00:08:38,831
<i>Lucille feared that the family would
come after the inheritance if they found out.</i>

168
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,835
Was she on the phone, Annyong?

169
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:45,503
<i>Annyong.</i>

170
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:47,338
Emery board.

171
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:52,337
Isn't he great?
And he goes with everything.

172
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:56,681
<i>Meanwhile, Gob was adjusting
to a new companion ofhis own.</i>

173
00:08:56,787 --> 00:08:59,278
<i>That's not the end of the trick.
There's a big surprise coming.</i>

174
00:08:59,389 --> 00:09:01,516
Take your T-shirt off, please.

175
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,753
What? Oh, you changed the trick.
It's a different trick.

176
00:09:04,861 --> 00:09:09,025
If I roll up this T-shirt,
put it in this hat...

177
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:11,896
<i>Gob! Hey, George Michael.</i>

178
00:09:12,002 --> 00:09:13,526
Hang on. We're in
the middle of something.

179
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:16,572
If you'll be so kind as to
expose your breast, please.

180
00:09:16,673 --> 00:09:19,938
No, no, no, no, no, no! Hey,
what the hell are you doing?

181
00:09:20,043 --> 00:09:22,603
Dad, it's misdirection. You're supposed
to keep your eye on the shirt in the hat.

182
00:09:22,712 --> 00:09:25,977
Get downstairs right now.
Come on.

183
00:09:26,082 --> 00:09:30,542
- Buddy, what are you doing here?
- I'm dying to see how he
makes this yacht disappear.

184
00:09:30,654 --> 00:09:32,554
He's not going to make
the yacht disappear. I told him that.

185
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:36,387
It's driving me crazy. It's like a mind
puzzle, an awesome mind puzzle.

186
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,393
<i>Michael looked at his son and saw...</i>

187
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:41,055
<i>that he truly was inspired
by his uncle...</i>

188
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:44,065
<i>that perhaps the boy
actually admired him.</i>

189
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,761
I gotta get you out of here. You're
gonna come work with me at the office.

190
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,838
Go wait in the stair car.

191
00:09:48,939 --> 00:09:53,069
Hey, I want you to explain something to me.
I'm out looking for Kitty...

192
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:56,634
<i>and I find my son in the middle of
a Girls With Low Self-Esteem video.</i>

193
00:09:56,746 --> 00:09:59,340
Don't worry. He's gonna be covered
with a blue dot. He approached me.

194
00:09:59,449 --> 00:10:01,849
And as for Kitty,
I think you're crazy to have fired her.

195
00:10:01,952 --> 00:10:03,943
Who knows what kind
of information she has?

196
00:10:04,054 --> 00:10:07,114
He's my brother,
and he's never even said "Good job."

197
00:10:07,224 --> 00:10:09,249
I just want him to love me,
you know?

198
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:13,318
Wow, you get really girlie after, huh?

199
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:17,161
Yeah, she definitely knows way too much.
Well, go get her. It's the holidays.

200
00:10:17,267 --> 00:10:19,758
- I'm sure she's down at Senor Tadpoles.
- Right.

201
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,838
Having a cocktail made
in her mouth. All right.

202
00:10:21,938 --> 00:10:25,271
I'm gonna go take care of that.
In the meantime, stay away from my son.

203
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,309
<i>Wow, Michael, I'm really hurt.</i>

204
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:30,311
<i>It's family. What's more important
than family, Michael?</i>

205
00:10:30,413 --> 00:10:32,938
- This yacht?
- Of course not, Gob.

206
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,176
You'd make the deal?
Because I'd sign off on that right now.

207
00:10:35,285 --> 00:10:38,686
<i>I stay away from your son,:
you let me use the yacht.</i>

208
00:10:38,788 --> 00:10:40,983
The holidays really brings out
the best in you.

209
00:10:41,091 --> 00:10:42,615
Well...

210
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:45,058
<i>Meanwhile, Tobias found
his experience as a therapist...</i>

211
00:10:45,161 --> 00:10:47,061
<i>was helping him deal
with his new cell mate.</i>

212
00:10:47,163 --> 00:10:49,154
<i>Yes, but where does
the hate come from, Bill?</i>

213
00:10:49,266 --> 00:10:53,066
- What causes it?
- TheJews, I guess.

214
00:10:53,169 --> 00:10:55,069
Sure. But I think you need
to look deeper.

215
00:10:55,171 --> 00:10:57,139
I think these are issues
of self-esteem.

216
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,640
<i>I know what it's like.
I know how it feels...</i>

217
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:02,303
to have a father,
or, in my case, a father-in-law...

218
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,312
who doesn't respect you.

219
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:06,575
"Anyhoo," we have very
little time...

220
00:11:06,683 --> 00:11:09,481
before this, uh, 4:00 pounding
you promised me.

221
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,713
I'm gonna take a shot
at something and say...

222
00:11:11,821 --> 00:11:15,518
that I think you hate
White Power Bill.

223
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:19,322
- I hate you!
- You hate White Power Bill.

224
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:22,990
- I hate the government!
- You hate White Power Bill.

225
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:27,832
<i>I hate my father!
- Recreation.
All prisoners, one hour.</i>

226
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:31,704
Go get 'em.

227
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,942
I hate White Power Bill.

228
00:11:36,046 --> 00:11:38,674
<i>I got a prisoner down! Prisoner down!</i>

229
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:41,512
- You killed him.
- Well, l...

230
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:45,110
Like Dorothy.
The Wicked Witch is dead.

231
00:11:45,221 --> 00:11:48,782
All hail Dorothy!

232
00:11:48,892 --> 00:11:53,295
<i>And at an elegant restaurant,
Michael asked Kitty to come back.</i>

233
00:11:53,396 --> 00:11:57,856
Who are you asking back, Michael?
Me? Or these?

234
00:11:57,968 --> 00:12:01,802
I want you all back.
I want the whole gang. Okay? Please, Kitty?

235
00:12:01,905 --> 00:12:04,032
I'm trying
real hard here, you know.

236
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,837
Can we just make believe that none of
this ever happened and just start fresh?

237
00:12:07,944 --> 00:12:10,037
Michael, of course I'll come back.

238
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,046
'Cause I never really left...

239
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,616
because we both know
that you can't fire people.

240
00:12:14,718 --> 00:12:16,948
No, I did fire you,
and now I'm hiring you back.

241
00:12:17,053 --> 00:12:19,283
You don't have authority
over me.

242
00:12:19,389 --> 00:12:22,051
- They don't have nachos here.
- You know what? Why don't we forget it?

243
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,388
Because I've been trying to be
very, very generous to you...

244
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:27,429
and you don't respect me,
so I'm firing you, okay?

245
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:31,762
- You are fired.
- All right, Michael.

246
00:12:31,868 --> 00:12:34,393
But I know where things are
and you don't...

247
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:38,463
and you are asking
for a whole world of trouble.

248
00:12:38,575 --> 00:12:40,770
If you're threatening me,
you're gonna be very sorry.

249
00:12:40,877 --> 00:12:43,812
- Are you threatening me?
- Yeah, that's a threat. I'm threatening you.

250
00:12:43,913 --> 00:12:47,246
Did you hear that everyone?
Michael Bluth is threatening me!

251
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,649
I've gotta get out of here.
I'm a part of the story.

252
00:12:50,754 --> 00:12:53,814
I can't be a part of the story.
I can't be a part of the story.

253
00:12:53,923 --> 00:12:57,518
Say good-bye
to your company, Michael.

254
00:12:57,627 --> 00:12:59,857
- And say good-bye to these.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

255
00:12:59,963 --> 00:13:01,863
'Cause it's the last time.

256
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:10,696
A woman shows all during a fracas
at a local restaurant, sources say.

257
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:16,913
<i>George Michael was working
harder than ever over his spring break...</i>

258
00:13:17,017 --> 00:13:19,781
<i>filling in for the now
twice-fired Kitty.</i>

259
00:13:19,887 --> 00:13:22,048
Look at us working together.
You get the hang of this...

260
00:13:22,156 --> 00:13:24,351
and this could be your summer.

261
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,449
I don't know, Dad. I really wanted
to see Gob's magic show and...

262
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,621
No, you don't. Isn't this much more fun,
working with your Dad?

263
00:13:30,731 --> 00:13:32,961
- It's just, there was some other...
- You gonna get that?

264
00:13:34,902 --> 00:13:36,802
- Thanks, Laura.
- Good afternoon. Bluth Company.

265
00:13:36,904 --> 00:13:40,465
Talk you off?
Talk you off what, Pop-Pop?

266
00:13:41,842 --> 00:13:44,140
George Michael.
I thought you were, um...

267
00:13:44,244 --> 00:13:47,372
When's that voice gonna drop?
Where's Kitty?

268
00:13:47,481 --> 00:13:50,814
I think Dad fired her again.
He wants to talk to you.

269
00:13:50,918 --> 00:13:54,354
I don't wanna talk to him.
I made my decision, and that's that.

270
00:13:54,455 --> 00:13:58,255
Oh, you heard?
Yeah. All right.

271
00:14:01,695 --> 00:14:05,495
- What did he say?
- If I clean it up, it's not really a sentence.

272
00:14:05,599 --> 00:14:08,693
<i>And so, George Sr. made another call.</i>

273
00:14:08,802 --> 00:14:12,203
Kitty's on the loose. I need you
to make something disappear for me.

274
00:14:12,306 --> 00:14:15,469
just some books in that cooler
marked "Maddas."

275
00:14:15,576 --> 00:14:18,101
<i>- Great.
- George Sr. hung up...</i>

276
00:14:18,212 --> 00:14:21,238
<i>confident that his problems
would finally be taken care of.</i>

277
00:14:21,348 --> 00:14:23,316
Hey, LittleJustice.

278
00:14:23,417 --> 00:14:26,250
You, uh, painted your shoes red.

279
00:14:26,353 --> 00:14:29,686
Call me the Tin Man.
I'm a Friend of Dorothy's now.

280
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:33,248
<i>- And she wants to see you.
- And back at the office...</i>

281
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,023
<i>Lindsay arrived with her daughter
and her mounting suspicions.</i>

282
00:14:37,131 --> 00:14:39,964
Mom says she sent Nana on a cruise.

283
00:14:40,067 --> 00:14:41,898
You're still on this?
How much was in those birthday cards?

284
00:14:42,002 --> 00:14:44,869
It's not about the money,
Michael. It's about Nana.

285
00:14:44,972 --> 00:14:46,872
I think Mom sent her
to a nursing home...

286
00:14:46,974 --> 00:14:49,738
some gray, windowless room...
against her will.

287
00:14:49,843 --> 00:14:53,301
- So what was it like out there today?
- Nice. Sunny.

288
00:14:53,413 --> 00:14:55,210
Wow.

289
00:14:55,315 --> 00:14:57,806
So, how do you think Gob's gonna
make this yacht disappear?

290
00:14:57,918 --> 00:15:00,478
Well, I'll be working here,
so I guess I'll never know.

291
00:15:00,587 --> 00:15:02,748
The only real way to find out
how it's done...

292
00:15:02,856 --> 00:15:04,756
is to sneak on the boat
while he does it.

293
00:15:04,858 --> 00:15:07,793
But if he makes it disappear,
won't everyone see me standing there?

294
00:15:07,895 --> 00:15:13,128
Let's just sit quietly and consider
how ridiculous that statement was.

295
00:15:15,369 --> 00:15:17,735
Anyways, if it was me,
that's what I would do.

296
00:15:17,838 --> 00:15:19,738
I wanna check out
Mom's financial activity.

297
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,899
Call her banks,
maybe run a hospital search.

298
00:15:22,009 --> 00:15:24,170
<i>It's gonna mean a lot of
hard work, but I'll put somebody on it.</i>

299
00:15:24,278 --> 00:15:27,179
George Michael.

300
00:15:27,281 --> 00:15:29,613
Where is George Michael?

301
00:15:29,716 --> 00:15:31,650
<i>In fact, at Maeby's suggestion...</i>

302
00:15:31,752 --> 00:15:34,380
<i>George Michael was off to visit
his Uncle Gob.</i>

303
00:15:34,488 --> 00:15:36,422
Hi, Uncle Gob.
I came by to see...

304
00:15:36,523 --> 00:15:38,582
if you need any help
with your magic show.

305
00:15:38,692 --> 00:15:41,923
- Great.
- I think it's so great that you're doing this.

306
00:15:42,029 --> 00:15:45,521
- I'm prepping right now.
- How'd you get my Dad's permission?

307
00:15:45,632 --> 00:15:47,429
<i>Suddenly, Gob remembered
the promise he had made...</i>

308
00:15:47,534 --> 00:15:49,468
<i>to stay away from Michael's son.</i>

309
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:52,095
None of your damn business.
Get the hell out of here.

310
00:15:52,206 --> 00:15:54,140
- What?
- You don't have the magic in you!

311
00:15:54,241 --> 00:15:56,141
You never did!
You don't have it here!

312
00:15:57,844 --> 00:16:00,938
So take a look. It's the last time
you're gonna see these.

313
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,480
- Sorry, kid, more than you'll ever...
- What?

314
00:16:05,586 --> 00:16:10,080
<i>Beat it!
- As Gob was forced
to send away someone he loved...</i>

315
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,954
<i>- You'll be missed.
- George Sr. was forced to visit...</i>

316
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:16,723
<i>someone he had once tried
to shove out of a moving car.</i>

317
00:16:18,131 --> 00:16:20,998
- Welcome.
- You're Dorothy?

318
00:16:21,101 --> 00:16:24,127
I thought the two of us
could talk, man-on-man.

319
00:16:25,439 --> 00:16:28,431
<i>I'm afraid I'm serious.</i>

320
00:16:28,542 --> 00:16:30,510
<i>I bought you.</i>

321
00:16:32,412 --> 00:16:35,074
- Remember to let it steep for five minutes.
- Oh, dear God.

322
00:16:35,182 --> 00:16:37,150
I've been in this family
for 16 years...

323
00:16:37,251 --> 00:16:39,481
and I don't think we've
ever had a conversation.

324
00:16:39,586 --> 00:16:41,918
- I'm not gonna discuss this.
- You hate me.

325
00:16:42,022 --> 00:16:44,616
Yeah, I do hate you.
You took my daughter...

326
00:16:44,725 --> 00:16:47,250
my precious little girl...
and moved her away...

327
00:16:47,361 --> 00:16:50,592
and now I'm here, and I am afraid
I will never get her back.

328
00:16:50,697 --> 00:16:53,257
Afraid. You're afraid.

329
00:16:53,367 --> 00:16:55,835
Fear has turned into hate.

330
00:16:55,936 --> 00:16:59,337
So Frightened Inmate #2
isn't frightened at all.

331
00:16:59,439 --> 00:17:03,432
He's angry.
He's a crabby old coot...

332
00:17:03,543 --> 00:17:05,534
and he needs love...

333
00:17:05,646 --> 00:17:07,841
just like everyone.

334
00:17:07,948 --> 00:17:09,939
Get your...
hands off of me.

335
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:12,917
Shh. Don't be scared.

336
00:17:20,627 --> 00:17:23,323
<i>And on the beach,
the show was beginning.</i>

337
00:17:29,469 --> 00:17:34,338
<i>Any magician can make
the queen of diamonds disappear...</i>

338
00:17:34,441 --> 00:17:37,899
but what about a whole boat?

339
00:18:01,201 --> 00:18:04,602
<i>Mom, have you seen
George Michael?</i>

340
00:18:04,705 --> 00:18:07,139
We just got here.
I couldn't find my keys.

341
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,231
- I can never find anything in here.
- We love you!

342
00:18:10,711 --> 00:18:15,205
Where once there was a yacht,
now there is naught!

343
00:18:26,626 --> 00:18:31,063
- All right. So how'd you do it?
- Michael, a magician never reveals his...

344
00:18:31,164 --> 00:18:33,462
I sunk it!
I sunk the yacht!

345
00:18:33,567 --> 00:18:37,469
<i>At least I think I sunk it. I mean,
I blew it up, and I don't see it anywhere.</i>

346
00:18:37,571 --> 00:18:40,005
My heart was in my throat when
that curtain came down and...

347
00:18:40,107 --> 00:18:41,108
- You sank the yacht?
- Shh!

348
00:18:41,108 --> 00:18:42,006
- You sank the yacht?
- Shh!

349
00:18:42,109 --> 00:18:45,670
- You sunk a $700,000 yacht?
- $900,000 worth of insurance on it.

350
00:18:45,779 --> 00:18:49,340
And got rid of the evidence.
How about a "good job"?

351
00:18:49,449 --> 00:18:52,816
<i>Seeing a window of opportunity,
Lucille made a startling announcement.</i>

352
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:55,444
- Nana was on that yacht!
- What?

353
00:18:55,555 --> 00:18:58,115
<i>- You killed Nana!
- She's lying!</i>

354
00:18:58,225 --> 00:19:00,455
Nana wasn't on that yacht.
She's fine.

355
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,154
<i>She's been dead for six months.
- Lindsay had learned
this information...</i>

356
00:19:03,263 --> 00:19:06,232
<i>- For about six months.
- when she spoke to the family's personal banker.</i>

357
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,699
<i>Later, fearing that
Lindsay was onto her...</i>

358
00:19:08,802 --> 00:19:10,702
<i>Lucille went to the bank herself.</i>

359
00:19:10,804 --> 00:19:14,001
<i>There must be somewhere I can put
this money where it can't be touched.</i>

360
00:19:14,107 --> 00:19:16,234
I suppose you could keep it
in your purse.

361
00:19:16,343 --> 00:19:19,471
Very funny, but I'm
not carrying a purse.

362
00:19:19,579 --> 00:19:21,638
<i>Where's the money, Mom?
I want the money.</i>

363
00:19:21,748 --> 00:19:25,411
You can't have it.
It's in a trust fund for Annyong.

364
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:27,146
<i>-  Annyong.
- No one can touch it but me...</i>

365
00:19:27,254 --> 00:19:30,018
and I retain control of it
until he's 18.

366
00:19:30,123 --> 00:19:32,387
I don't know what's more offensive...
the fact you didn't tell us...

367
00:19:32,492 --> 00:19:36,519
<i>about our grandmother's death
or that you sunk a $ 700,000 yacht!</i>

368
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:39,531
<i>Stop lecturing me.
I just lost my mother.</i>

369
00:19:39,633 --> 00:19:41,828
I'm so glad George Michael
wasn't here to see any of this.

370
00:19:41,935 --> 00:19:44,335
Maeby, where is George Michael?

371
00:19:44,438 --> 00:19:49,239
Um, well, if he's not here, I'd just
have to say he's probably on the yacht.

372
00:19:49,342 --> 00:19:51,207
On the yacht?

373
00:19:51,311 --> 00:19:53,779
<i>In fact, George Michael
had boarded the yacht.</i>

374
00:19:53,914 --> 00:19:57,475
<i>But when he saw the evidence
of Gob's lifestyle...</i>

375
00:19:57,584 --> 00:20:00,781
<i>he realized that this perhaps
was not the life he wanted.</i>

376
00:20:00,887 --> 00:20:03,378
<i>While Kitty went in search
of retribution...</i>

377
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:06,084
<i>in the form of the files
in the cooler.</i>

378
00:20:06,193 --> 00:20:09,424
<i>George Michael's a good kid.
I'm sure he's at the office.</i>

379
00:20:09,529 --> 00:20:11,429
Right. I told him
to stay away from you.

380
00:20:11,531 --> 00:20:15,092
- I told you to stay away from him!
- I tried. I told him to get out.

381
00:20:15,202 --> 00:20:17,102
Bluth Company.
George Michael speaking, not Kitty.

382
00:20:17,204 --> 00:20:20,264
- Thank God you're there.
- I don't need a real spring break.

383
00:20:20,373 --> 00:20:24,070
I really think I am much better off here
alone in this office.

384
00:20:24,177 --> 00:20:27,635
<i>Michael realized
what he had done to his son...</i>

385
00:20:27,747 --> 00:20:29,647
<i>so he came up with a solution.</i>

386
00:20:29,749 --> 00:20:31,979
- You're fired.
- Really?

387
00:20:32,085 --> 00:20:34,349
Can you fire people?

388
00:20:34,454 --> 00:20:36,388
Yeah. Go have a spring break.

389
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:38,924
Thanks, Dad.

390
00:20:39,025 --> 00:20:40,720
Are you sure you're gonna
be okay without Kitty?

391
00:20:40,827 --> 00:20:43,387
Don't you worry.
She'll turn up.

392
00:20:50,604 --> 00:20:53,402
<i>On the next
Arrested Development.</i>

393
00:20:53,507 --> 00:20:56,476
<i>Lupe makes
a startling discovery.</i>

394
00:20:56,576 --> 00:21:00,410
Oh, so that makes
Annyong 18.

395
00:21:00,514 --> 00:21:02,982
<i>And Michael finds himself
in the middle of the search...</i>

396
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,108
<i>for a missing Kitty.</i>

397
00:21:05,218 --> 00:21:06,879
Well, we have a restaurant
full of people saying...

398
00:21:06,987 --> 00:21:08,818
that you threatened Kitty
the last time she was seen.

399
00:21:08,922 --> 00:21:11,152
How does anybody
even remember this?

400
00:21:11,258 --> 00:21:15,991
- She showed her knobs in the steakhouse, sir.
- She...
