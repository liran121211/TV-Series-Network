1
00:00:01,153 --> 00:00:04,054
<i>Now the story of
a wealthy family who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:04,156 --> 00:00:08,252
<i>and the one son who had no choice
but to keep them all together.</i>

3
00:00:13,766 --> 00:00:16,030
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

4
00:00:19,505 --> 00:00:22,804
<i>Michael was sharing his bed
for the first time in years.</i>

5
00:00:22,908 --> 00:00:26,309
<i>Unfortunately, it was with
his younger brother, Buster.</i>

6
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:33,846
Buster.
Buster.

7
00:00:33,952 --> 00:00:35,886
Hey-Hey.
Whoa, whoa. Buster!

8
00:00:35,988 --> 00:00:39,515
Hey, Brother.

9
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:43,220
I don't think us sleeping together
is working out.

10
00:00:43,328 --> 00:00:46,195
You're a grown man.
You should be living with your mother.

11
00:00:46,298 --> 00:00:49,096
- Yeah, I miss Mom.
- I can tell.

12
00:00:49,201 --> 00:00:53,968
- Hey, good morning. What are you doing?
- It's my ethics essay.

13
00:00:54,073 --> 00:00:56,303
I'm supposed to write 200 words
on the morality of war...

14
00:00:56,408 --> 00:00:58,876
whether a preemptive strike
is ever justified.

15
00:00:58,977 --> 00:01:03,209
<i>Absolutely. It's preemptive, you know,
happens before something else. So...</i>

16
00:01:03,315 --> 00:01:05,977
if you can predict aggression
and you wanna squash it...

17
00:01:06,085 --> 00:01:08,212
I don't know why you're not typing?
This is all good.

18
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,585
I'm not sure if my ethics teacher
would love if I cheated on my essay.

19
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:13,920
Well, you just passed my ethics test.

20
00:01:14,026 --> 00:01:16,790
<i>In fact, George Michael
had developed a hopeless crush...</i>

21
00:01:16,895 --> 00:01:19,830
<i>on his ethics teacher,
a woman named Beth Baerly.</i>

22
00:01:19,932 --> 00:01:22,423
Even minor crimes are punishable...

23
00:01:22,534 --> 00:01:24,900
by brutally chopping off
the offender's hand.

24
00:01:25,003 --> 00:01:27,733
Mmm. No ring.

25
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,570
<i>- Can't wait to meet her
at Parent-Teacher Night.
- Oh yeah. Dad, hey, Dad...</i>

26
00:01:30,676 --> 00:01:33,076
- try to remember everything
she says about me, all right?
- Okay.

27
00:01:33,178 --> 00:01:35,146
Michael.

28
00:01:35,247 --> 00:01:37,738
I need you to do something
about my son.

29
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:40,182
I totally agree, Mom. Buster
goes home, we flip the mattress...

30
00:01:40,285 --> 00:01:43,948
- this never happened.
- Not Buster. Read this.

31
00:01:47,426 --> 00:01:49,326
<i>Did you and Dad adopt a child?</i>

32
00:01:49,428 --> 00:01:51,362
<i>The S.E.C. was onto us.</i>

33
00:01:51,463 --> 00:01:54,591
Your father thought it would
make us look charitable.

34
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,100
He must have forged my signature.

35
00:01:57,202 --> 00:01:59,261
<i>Well, maybe I'll get a son who will...</i>

36
00:01:59,371 --> 00:02:03,102
<i>finish his cottage cheese!</i>

37
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:04,971
You've got to get me out of this.

38
00:02:05,077 --> 00:02:08,137
I'll call Social Services,
but you must take Buster back.

39
00:02:08,247 --> 00:02:10,147
- Okay.
- Great.

40
00:02:10,249 --> 00:02:12,217
But I'm not taking care
of him either.

41
00:02:12,317 --> 00:02:15,684
I don't have the milk
of mother's kindness in me anymore.

42
00:02:15,787 --> 00:02:19,279
Yeah, that udder's been dry
for a while now, hasn't it?

43
00:02:19,391 --> 00:02:21,655
Kind of?

44
00:02:22,561 --> 00:02:24,461
- Hello.
- Michael.

45
00:02:24,563 --> 00:02:26,724
I've got
a couple of girls here.

46
00:02:26,832 --> 00:02:29,392
<i>A couple of fun girls...</i>

47
00:02:29,501 --> 00:02:32,629
- I thought I'd bring you in on.
- Oh, I don't know, Gob.

48
00:02:32,738 --> 00:02:35,138
<i>Come on, Michael.
So we had a little disagreement.</i>

49
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,299
<i>Recently, Gob
had discovered that Michael...</i>

50
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:40,310
<i>was interested in his
now ex-girlfriend, Marta.</i>

51
00:02:40,412 --> 00:02:42,846
I'm offering you an olive branch here.

52
00:02:42,948 --> 00:02:45,075
Yeah-Yeah. No. l-I know,
and l-I appreciate that. It's just...

53
00:02:45,184 --> 00:02:47,846
Besides, when was the last
time you slept with someone?

54
00:02:47,953 --> 00:02:50,683
- Buster.
- What time and where?

55
00:02:50,789 --> 00:02:53,917
<i>Meanwhile, Lindsay was helping
George Michael with his homework.</i>

56
00:02:54,026 --> 00:02:57,427
- Oh, come on, let's do something.
It's just a stupid essay.
- No, I can't.

57
00:02:57,529 --> 00:03:00,191
I don't want to let down Ms. Baerly.
She's nice, you know.

58
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:03,999
- And she's interesting...
- And pretty?

59
00:03:04,102 --> 00:03:07,663
Well, I don't know why
I'm telling you this.

60
00:03:07,773 --> 00:03:10,435
I guess there's just some things
you can't really say to your dad.

61
00:03:10,542 --> 00:03:14,273
Ah. Sounds like you'd like her
to be more than just your teacher.

62
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:18,338
<i>Lindsay believed that
George Michael wanted to fix up his father...</i>

63
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,748
<i>so he could fill the role ofhis mother.</i>

64
00:03:20,852 --> 00:03:23,150
There's nothing wrong with that.

65
00:03:23,255 --> 00:03:28,283
Although, I must say I'm a little
hurt that you haven't considered me.

66
00:03:30,095 --> 00:03:32,825
- You're my aunt.
- That doesn't matter.

67
00:03:32,931 --> 00:03:37,163
Aunts can fill that role.
Teachers can fill that role.

68
00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:41,035
And, someday, you're gonna find
the right woman to fill that role.

69
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:45,439
But until then,
I'll be right across the hall.

70
00:03:46,845 --> 00:03:52,283
<i>Lindsay had never been more
proud of anything she had said in her entire life.</i>

71
00:03:53,585 --> 00:03:56,520
<i>Yikes.
- Meanwhile, Gob
was waiting for Michael to show up.</i>

72
00:03:56,622 --> 00:04:00,058
- Oh, there he is. Michael.
- Yes.

73
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:02,558
This is Shannon, the girl
I've been telling you all about.

74
00:04:02,661 --> 00:04:04,788
Yes.
Girl, indeed... young girl.

75
00:04:04,896 --> 00:04:07,626
- That's a young, young, young, girl.
- Yeah, well, she's 18.

76
00:04:07,733 --> 00:04:10,065
<i>So, it's like...
Oh, and this is...</i>

77
00:04:10,168 --> 00:04:12,398
- your date, Nazh...
- galia.

78
00:04:12,504 --> 00:04:16,907
- Hello, my God!
- Well, Shannon wouldn't go out
without a chaperone...

79
00:04:17,009 --> 00:04:19,273
- Right.
- and so she's your date.

80
00:04:19,378 --> 00:04:22,176
<i>It was clear that Gob wasn't
offering an olive branch at all...</i>

81
00:04:22,281 --> 00:04:25,478
<i>and, in fact, was still
harboring some resentment over Marta.</i>

82
00:04:25,584 --> 00:04:29,247
Oh...
"Nagarma," you've got a mustache.
- Hey!

83
00:04:29,354 --> 00:04:31,982
- I mean, you've got milk on your mustache.
- Oh.

84
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,990
- I mean, you've got a milk mustache.
- Yeah.

85
00:04:34,092 --> 00:04:38,461
It's adorable. You look like
one of those "Got Milk" models.

86
00:04:38,563 --> 00:04:41,828
<i>But Gob mistook Michael's
basic human decency for romantic interest...</i>

87
00:04:41,933 --> 00:04:45,164
<i>and felt a competitive urge to step in.</i>

88
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:49,764
Because, you know,
it's beyond adorable... and e-exotic.

89
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:53,777
- I find you very attractive.
- Really?

90
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:56,177
<i>And George Sr.
was about to get a surprise visitor.</i>

91
00:04:56,281 --> 00:05:00,047
Mr. Bluth?
I'm Cindi Lightballoon.

92
00:05:00,152 --> 00:05:04,680
I've studied all your teachings,
and I've purchased every tape.

93
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:07,281
And I watch 'em over and over.

94
00:05:07,392 --> 00:05:11,055
<i>George Sr. had recently marketed
a line of self-help tapes...</i>

95
00:05:11,163 --> 00:05:13,631
<i>touting his newly discovered spirituality.</i>

96
00:05:13,732 --> 00:05:17,133
I've also lost four pounds on your low-carb
Bluth Banana Jail Bars.

97
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:23,965
I've come to learn at your feet.

98
00:05:26,712 --> 00:05:28,646
That's a good place to start.

99
00:05:30,048 --> 00:05:34,849
<i>And Michael, free ofhis double
date, met Lindsay at Parent-Teacher Night.</i>

100
00:05:34,953 --> 00:05:36,853
<i>Hey, Linds, is it my imagination...</i>

101
00:05:36,955 --> 00:05:39,480
or does this rape room have
the same floor plan as our kitchen?

102
00:05:39,591 --> 00:05:41,991
Did you meet Ms. Baerly yet,
the ethics teacher? 'Cause I just did.

103
00:05:42,094 --> 00:05:44,528
No, not yet.
Look, these are our cabinets.

104
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:47,029
Yeah. Well, I think
she's perfect for you.

105
00:05:47,132 --> 00:05:49,032
- For me? Really?
- Mm-hmm.

106
00:05:49,134 --> 00:05:51,329
Thanks, but no. I've already been set up
once today by a sibling...

107
00:05:51,436 --> 00:05:53,495
and I don't think
you people know my type.

108
00:05:53,605 --> 00:05:56,472
Hey, look. It's not coming from me.
It's-It's George Michael.

109
00:05:56,575 --> 00:06:00,011
He told me.
I think he wants a mother.

110
00:06:00,112 --> 00:06:02,171
<i>Well, that's ridiculous.
He's got you. He's got our mother.</i>

111
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,248
You'd think that would turn
him off to the entire concept.

112
00:06:04,349 --> 00:06:08,877
Besides, I'm not gonna rush out
and marry somebody just because
you think my son would like it.

113
00:06:10,188 --> 00:06:13,214
Welcome. I'm Ms. Baerly,
the ethics teacher.

114
00:06:13,325 --> 00:06:17,318
<i>My goal is to teach your children
about the preciousness oflife...</i>

115
00:06:17,429 --> 00:06:20,364
that can be lost
by the mindless pulling of a trigger.

116
00:06:20,465 --> 00:06:24,367
Mmm. No ring.

117
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:29,903
<i>And so Michael got to know
his son's ethics teacher.</i>

118
00:06:30,008 --> 00:06:31,999
Ethics... right and wrong.

119
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:34,840
How can one thing can be right
and another one be wrong?

120
00:06:34,946 --> 00:06:37,744
I mean, which is which, you know?

121
00:06:37,849 --> 00:06:40,249
I guess that's the "Rrrr" of it.

122
00:06:40,352 --> 00:06:42,252
You know, so frustrating.

123
00:06:42,354 --> 00:06:45,687
I don't know. I mean, they just threw this class
at me after Mr. Daniels had a stroke.

124
00:06:47,859 --> 00:06:50,191
I had him, Mr. Daniels.
How is he?

125
00:06:50,295 --> 00:06:53,492
- Oh, he, you know, had a stroke.
- Oh.

126
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:56,624
- Thought you were joking.
- No, I was just laughing 'cause you were laughing.

127
00:06:56,735 --> 00:06:59,636
- Right. No. Yeah. Gosh. Hmm.
- Yeah.

128
00:06:59,738 --> 00:07:02,036
- "Rrrr!"
- "Rrrr!"

129
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,802
<i>- But, you know, l-l... I really
am antiwar and antiviolence.
- Uh-huh.</i>

130
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,969
- And I think I'm an ethical person.
- Right.

131
00:07:07,078 --> 00:07:09,046
Here's an ethical question.

132
00:07:09,147 --> 00:07:13,880
Can-Can a parent take a teacher out
for a drink? Or...

133
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,547
I don't know.
Uh, do you have a wife?

134
00:07:17,656 --> 00:07:20,557
- Yeah. But she's dead.
- Oh.

135
00:07:23,495 --> 00:07:26,055
Have you ever been married?

136
00:07:26,164 --> 00:07:28,394
Yeah, she died.

137
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,298
Ohh.
God, why are we laughing?

138
00:07:31,403 --> 00:07:33,394
I don't...
Well, it's the Mr. Daniels stroke thing...

139
00:07:33,505 --> 00:07:35,735
all over again.

140
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,899
- Let's go get that drink.
- Yeah, it could only help.

141
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:40,842
- Rrrr!
- Rrr!

142
00:07:40,946 --> 00:07:45,110
<i>George Sr. was dealing
with his own admirer.</i>

143
00:07:45,217 --> 00:07:48,880
Oh, I've already told
you so many of my sins.

144
00:07:48,987 --> 00:07:51,148
Maybe you could
tell me some of yours.

145
00:07:51,256 --> 00:07:53,747
Uh, well, there are
legal implications to that.

146
00:07:53,858 --> 00:07:56,918
But, uh, back to your sins.
Uh, do that one about the, uh...

147
00:07:57,028 --> 00:07:59,292
ladies' shower...

148
00:07:59,397 --> 00:08:01,592
in your college dorm again.

149
00:08:03,068 --> 00:08:06,128
<i>And Michael was on his way
to what would be his second date...</i>

150
00:08:06,238 --> 00:08:08,172
<i>with Ms. Baerly.</i>

151
00:08:08,273 --> 00:08:10,366
Michael, the little Korean is here,
and I don't know what to do with him.

152
00:08:10,475 --> 00:08:12,443
At least, I think it's a him.

153
00:08:12,544 --> 00:08:15,172
You've got to strip them down to next
to nothing before you can even tell.

154
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,874
Yeah, Mom.
I just spoke to Social Services...

155
00:08:17,983 --> 00:08:20,144
and although
they don't like to do this...

156
00:08:20,252 --> 00:08:22,311
if you can prove that
it's a bad environment for a child...

157
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:26,288
and I would suggest saying what you
just said to me, don't change a word...

158
00:08:26,391 --> 00:08:30,657
- they will take him back.
- Ha, ha, ha. Uh, don't get too comfortable.

159
00:08:30,762 --> 00:08:33,629
<i>Shoes on, mister! Shoes on!</i>

160
00:08:33,732 --> 00:08:35,632
He's out of control.

161
00:08:35,734 --> 00:08:37,634
Hold on.

162
00:08:39,571 --> 00:08:43,473
I'm back.

163
00:08:44,576 --> 00:08:46,635
Who's that?

164
00:08:46,745 --> 00:08:50,146
This is "Annyong,"
who your father and I have adopted.

165
00:08:50,248 --> 00:08:53,308
What, I'm gone for a couple days
and you find a new son?

166
00:08:53,418 --> 00:08:56,979
<i>Lucille could see that
her son was concerned, even jealous.</i>

167
00:08:57,088 --> 00:08:59,488
<i>And she knew how it felt
to be overlooked.</i>

168
00:08:59,591 --> 00:09:03,425
Yes. Annyong is your brother now.

169
00:09:03,528 --> 00:09:07,157
Yes, Annyong.
Excuse me. Oh, Michael?

170
00:09:07,265 --> 00:09:09,495
Call it off.

171
00:09:09,601 --> 00:09:12,092
I'm keeping him.

172
00:09:12,203 --> 00:09:14,637
- Look, I gotta call you back.
- Sweet ride.

173
00:09:14,739 --> 00:09:17,207
Are you making
dinner reservations?

174
00:09:17,309 --> 00:09:19,675
No, no.
That was my Mom. She just had...

175
00:09:19,778 --> 00:09:22,872
- a "little Korean" dropped off.
- Ooh, that sounds good. Let's have that.

176
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,418
<i>- Hello.
- And after their date...</i>

177
00:09:31,523 --> 00:09:34,549
<i>Michael took a step
he hadn't taken in years.</i>

178
00:09:35,694 --> 00:09:37,787
Okay, do you think this is a good idea?

179
00:09:37,896 --> 00:09:39,830
I think it's a great idea.

180
00:09:41,299 --> 00:09:43,426
Mmm.

181
00:09:43,535 --> 00:09:45,435
Such a good idea.

182
00:09:45,537 --> 00:09:48,438
But how are we going to sneak in
without waking everyone up?

183
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,701
We'll take the stairs.

184
00:09:53,411 --> 00:09:56,403
This may not have been
my best idea.

185
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,249
I'm sorry, Michael.

186
00:10:08,093 --> 00:10:12,154
I'm sorry too, Michael,
but it looks like we're even.

187
00:10:12,263 --> 00:10:16,563
You took something I liked.
I took something you liked.

188
00:10:16,668 --> 00:10:20,069
Yeah.
l... ... "Nashbagerlajam."

189
00:10:20,171 --> 00:10:23,572
Listen, I know that you've been
trying to get even with me about Marta.

190
00:10:23,675 --> 00:10:26,405
But got bad news for ya.
I'm seeing somebody else.

191
00:10:26,511 --> 00:10:29,071
Who? Who?

192
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:32,479
just out of curiosity... I'm not
gonna try to sleep with her.

193
00:10:32,584 --> 00:10:35,576
- Forget it. I thought that this was behind us.
- It is behind us.

194
00:10:35,687 --> 00:10:38,952
<i>- Great.
- When I sleep with her.
'Cause I'm gonna sleep with her.</i>

195
00:10:39,057 --> 00:10:41,252
Yeah. I was lying when I said
I wasn't gonna to sleep with her, so...

196
00:10:41,359 --> 00:10:44,055
- She'd have to agree to it.
- I don't anticipate a problem with that.

197
00:10:44,162 --> 00:10:46,960
- No?
- No. 'Cause I've seen some of the dogs you like.

198
00:10:47,065 --> 00:10:48,589
- Right.
- I just slept with one.

199
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,669
- Again, didn't like Nazhgalia.
- Really.

200
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:54,034
- Really, and good luck getting rid of her.
- Oh, please.

201
00:10:54,139 --> 00:10:57,597
Not a problem. She knows it was
a one-time thing. Totally cool.

202
00:10:57,709 --> 00:11:02,669
- Oh, so romantic.
- Who's "N. Bahn-Ahden?"

203
00:11:02,781 --> 00:11:04,942
Hello.

204
00:11:05,049 --> 00:11:07,517
<i>Hey, George Michael.</i>

205
00:11:07,619 --> 00:11:11,111
I wanted to talk to you about something
before, but I didn't know if it was real.

206
00:11:11,222 --> 00:11:13,452
But now, uh...

207
00:11:13,558 --> 00:11:15,685
your ethics teacher...

208
00:11:15,794 --> 00:11:17,887
- Yeah, I just made this for her.
- Oh.

209
00:11:17,996 --> 00:11:20,294
She loves Saddam Hussein.

210
00:11:20,398 --> 00:11:23,799
I'm sure she doesn't love Saddam.
I'm sure she is interested in him...

211
00:11:23,902 --> 00:11:26,393
as a subject, you know.

212
00:11:26,504 --> 00:11:29,598
- Right. That's what I meant.
- Great.

213
00:11:29,707 --> 00:11:32,471
You know, I just wanted to make her
something special to show that I care.

214
00:11:32,577 --> 00:11:35,546
- About the class?
- No. I mean, about her.

215
00:11:35,647 --> 00:11:38,912
- Oh!
- I kind of love her.

216
00:11:39,017 --> 00:11:42,316
You mean, you love her like...
like she loves Saddam.

217
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:46,083
<i>- Right?
- No, no. I mean, like, love her love her.</i>

218
00:11:46,191 --> 00:11:48,659
Oh.

219
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,661
- Oh.
- Oh, hi!

220
00:11:51,763 --> 00:11:54,823
Hi, George Michael. I was just...

221
00:11:54,933 --> 00:11:56,867
Iooking at this model home.

222
00:11:56,968 --> 00:11:59,027
I'm gonna go home
and think about it.

223
00:11:59,137 --> 00:12:01,128
I'm gonna go home,
think about it.

224
00:12:02,507 --> 00:12:05,032
Dad, what was she doing here?

225
00:12:05,143 --> 00:12:07,668
I mean, sh... she wasn't...

226
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:12,842
<i>Michael knew he had an ethical
responsibility to tell his son the truth.</i>

227
00:12:12,951 --> 00:12:15,476
Yes.

228
00:12:15,587 --> 00:12:18,385
Your Uncle Gob slept with her.

229
00:12:23,466 --> 00:12:26,367
Well, why would he do that? Why
would Gob sleep with my ethics teacher?

230
00:12:26,469 --> 00:12:29,438
- Probably to get even with me.
- How would that be getting even with you?

231
00:12:29,538 --> 00:12:32,871
- I'm the one that likes her.
- Right. Right.

232
00:12:32,975 --> 00:12:34,875
No, I know.
You and I know that, but Gob he just...

233
00:12:34,977 --> 00:12:39,311
He's not that exact of a target shooter,
and he just kind of sprays it everywhere.

234
00:12:39,415 --> 00:12:43,112
You know, but listen, did-did you really
think that-that... that you had a...

235
00:12:43,219 --> 00:12:45,483
I mean, she's kinda
old for you, don't you think?

236
00:12:45,588 --> 00:12:47,749
We don't even know how old she is.
No one does.

237
00:12:47,857 --> 00:12:49,950
She was chaperoning
the diversity dance...

238
00:12:50,059 --> 00:12:52,721
and I thought maybe as a joke,
I'd go up to her and be, like...

239
00:12:52,828 --> 00:12:54,853
"Well, hey, do you want to dance?"

240
00:12:54,964 --> 00:12:57,398
And she'd be, like, "Ah, what the heck?"
Right? Or some... I don't know.

241
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,627
- I did it differently in the mirror, but...
- Right.

242
00:12:59,735 --> 00:13:01,726
<i>- But, you know, like, we'd be
joke dancing or something.
- I get it.</i>

243
00:13:01,837 --> 00:13:05,705
- I didn't think it through.
- Don't you think you should be
taking somebody your own age?

244
00:13:05,808 --> 00:13:07,742
Like your cousin.

245
00:13:07,843 --> 00:13:10,710
- That's a bad example, but...
- I feel so stupid.

246
00:13:10,813 --> 00:13:14,943
I defaced a rare book to get that picture
of Saddam Hussein in a bathing suit.

247
00:13:16,152 --> 00:13:18,586
<i>- "What would Saddam do?"
- Yeah.</i>

248
00:13:18,687 --> 00:13:21,417
Yeah, you know something?
You're right. Gob's gonna pay.

249
00:13:25,995 --> 00:13:29,328
Okay,
that is our exact outdoor fire pit.

250
00:13:29,432 --> 00:13:33,926
<i>At prison, George Sr. was preparing
for an evening with his most devoted fan.</i>

251
00:13:34,036 --> 00:13:37,494
<i>While Cindi Lightballoon was
making preparations ofher own.</i>

252
00:13:37,606 --> 00:13:39,506
<i>- How we doin'?
- We have video.</i>

253
00:13:39,608 --> 00:13:44,443
- Testing one, two.
- Tilt back a little, will you, Harris?

254
00:13:44,547 --> 00:13:47,175
Let's bust this guy.

255
00:13:47,283 --> 00:13:50,116
<i>So George Michael, still angry at Gob...</i>

256
00:13:50,219 --> 00:13:52,517
<i>sought out the family expert
on making trouble.</i>

257
00:13:52,621 --> 00:13:56,148
- I know he was dating that girl Shannon.
- The cheerleader?

258
00:13:56,258 --> 00:13:59,125
Yeah, she's probably gonna take him
to that stupid diversity dance.

259
00:13:59,228 --> 00:14:01,287
I wish I had someone shocking to take.

260
00:14:01,397 --> 00:14:03,865
You know, I actually called
Mr. Daniels and asked him...

261
00:14:03,966 --> 00:14:07,493
but he got all out of breath
and dropped the phone.

262
00:14:07,603 --> 00:14:11,004
- I never heard back.
- You know, may-maybe
we should go together.

263
00:14:11,106 --> 00:14:15,236
<i>Right, I mean, it's a bad example...
l... But should we?</i>

264
00:14:15,344 --> 00:14:17,244
Hello.

265
00:14:17,346 --> 00:14:19,541
Yes, Annyong.
Your name's Annyong.

266
00:14:19,648 --> 00:14:22,208
We all know you're Annyong.
Annyong. Annyong. Annyong.

267
00:14:22,318 --> 00:14:25,549
- Who's this?
- Oh, I'm sorry. This is Annyong.

268
00:14:25,654 --> 00:14:28,316
My mom bought him.
She's making me register him for school.

269
00:14:28,424 --> 00:14:32,360
- He's my new little brother.
- So we're related.

270
00:14:32,461 --> 00:14:37,364
- Hey, wanna go to a dance?
- Oh, great, another uncle to compete with.

271
00:14:37,466 --> 00:14:40,765
<i>And Michael went to discuss
the George Michael situation with Ms. Baerly.</i>

272
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:43,361
<i>Being held against their will...</i>

273
00:14:43,472 --> 00:14:48,102
purely on the basis of political
or religious beliefs.

274
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:51,668
I'm sorry.
I met someone. I'm sorry.

275
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:55,876
<i>Anyway, this is serious.
This is atrocities. No more smiling.</i>

276
00:14:55,985 --> 00:14:59,011
Michael! Uh, just a minute.

277
00:15:01,123 --> 00:15:03,523
- Hi. Sorry...
- Hi!

278
00:15:03,626 --> 00:15:05,890
Don't worry. George Michael's
not in there. Those are the dumb kids.

279
00:15:05,995 --> 00:15:08,225
Okay.
Um, listen.

280
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:10,594
- This is uh...
- Wow! Did you make this for me?

281
00:15:10,699 --> 00:15:12,758
This is so sweet.
I love Hussein.

282
00:15:12,868 --> 00:15:16,804
- You mean, you're interested in him.
- Oh, yes. He is a monster.

283
00:15:16,906 --> 00:15:19,636
- Yeah.
- Wow. Where did you find
this one of him in a Speedo?

284
00:15:19,742 --> 00:15:22,233
This is what I want to talk to you
about, though. Um, Beth...

285
00:15:22,344 --> 00:15:24,744
I don't think that
I can continue to see you.

286
00:15:26,849 --> 00:15:29,579
But I've enjoyed
my time with you.

287
00:15:29,685 --> 00:15:33,917
- You ever wanna talk ethics...
- You really mean it? This isn't
one of"my wife died"jokes?

288
00:15:34,023 --> 00:15:37,288
- No, I'm afraid this is serious.
- Oh.

289
00:15:37,393 --> 00:15:39,384
You see, George Michael
made this poster for you.

290
00:15:39,495 --> 00:15:43,431
You know, he-he kind of, uh,
is in love with you, so...

291
00:15:43,532 --> 00:15:47,059
- He knows we're going out.
He saw me this morning.
- No, I covered that.

292
00:15:47,169 --> 00:15:49,467
I told him that you
slept with my brother.

293
00:15:49,572 --> 00:15:52,735
That may be the most
unethical thing I've ever heard.

294
00:15:52,841 --> 00:15:55,469
Well, you've only been
doing this half a semester.

295
00:15:55,578 --> 00:16:00,208
Look, it was a preemptive strike.
My brother would've tried to sleep with you.

296
00:16:00,316 --> 00:16:02,716
- Well, I want you to leave
right now and not come back.
- Right. I know.

297
00:16:02,818 --> 00:16:06,413
I understand. I'm sorry.
And you will not see me again.

298
00:16:11,727 --> 00:16:15,163
Starting right now.

299
00:16:15,264 --> 00:16:17,858
<i>George Sr. went on a walk
with Cindi.
- George.</i>

300
00:16:17,967 --> 00:16:22,529
<i>- And she was getting to him.
- You can feel safe to fully reveal yourself to me.</i>

301
00:16:22,638 --> 00:16:25,937
Hmm, all right.
There is...

302
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:29,704
- There is something.
- Come closer.

303
00:16:29,812 --> 00:16:34,181
It's weighing heavy on my soul.

304
00:16:34,283 --> 00:16:39,448
You, uh... You know, the Talmud teaches
us to... There you go.

305
00:16:39,555 --> 00:16:41,455
- What's he doing?
- He's pinching the camera.

306
00:16:41,557 --> 00:16:43,457
He's on to us.
He's found the camera.

307
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:45,652
- Get out of there. He's got the camera.
Abort! Abort!
- Get the dog.

308
00:16:45,761 --> 00:16:47,854
Clean the dog.
We are cleaning the dog!

309
00:16:59,241 --> 00:17:02,369
<i>That night, Buster
came home to an empty apartment.</i>

310
00:17:03,512 --> 00:17:06,037
<i>So, it's off with Mother now.</i>

311
00:17:06,148 --> 00:17:09,675
<i>In fact, Lucille was just
giving Annyong and Maeby a ride.</i>

312
00:17:09,785 --> 00:17:12,583
You're trying to steal
from the wrong man.

313
00:17:12,688 --> 00:17:15,657
Watch your back,
my little immigrant friend!

314
00:17:20,529 --> 00:17:23,862
<i>And the spring
diversity dance was in full swing.</i>

315
00:17:23,966 --> 00:17:27,265
- Whoa, sorry. Students only.
- Oh.

316
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:31,271
So you're not letting him in because he
doesn't share your perfectly shaped nose...

317
00:17:31,373 --> 00:17:35,036
your round eye-shaped eyes,
your strong square jaw.

318
00:17:35,144 --> 00:17:37,510
Thanks.
You wanna dance?

319
00:17:37,613 --> 00:17:39,581
- Yeah!
- All right!

320
00:17:39,682 --> 00:17:42,173
Steve Holt!

321
00:17:42,284 --> 00:17:44,616
<i>And Gob sought out Shannon...
- Shannon!</i>

322
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,450
<i>who had found out he had
cheated on her with Nazhgalia.</i>

323
00:17:47,556 --> 00:17:50,821
Shannon, where are you?
Shannon!

324
00:17:50,926 --> 00:17:53,952
Oh, hey, Lisa.
Shannon!

325
00:17:54,997 --> 00:17:57,329
Excuse me.
Look, I blew it, okay?

326
00:17:57,433 --> 00:18:00,425
But I bought a yearbook ad from you.
Doesn't that mean anything anymore?

327
00:18:00,536 --> 00:18:04,438
<i>Beth! Hey, hi.
Listen...</i>

328
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:07,703
Um, I blew it okay?
I had to see you.

329
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:09,869
l-I've been giving this
a lot of thought, and-and...

330
00:18:09,978 --> 00:18:13,414
- I have to do the right thing.
- You're gonna tell George Michael the truth?

331
00:18:13,515 --> 00:18:16,143
Oh, that's... that's your
definition of the right thing.

332
00:18:16,251 --> 00:18:19,812
I thought I was gonna make
a dramatic entrance and tell you
that I wanted to see you. Okay.

333
00:18:19,922 --> 00:18:22,288
Uh, I'll get right on that.

334
00:18:22,391 --> 00:18:25,724
George Michael!
Where are you? George Michael!

335
00:18:25,828 --> 00:18:28,956
- Uncle Gob?
- George Michael.

336
00:18:29,064 --> 00:18:31,294
- What are you doing at a high school dance?
- I'm looking for you.

337
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,960
- How could you do this to me?
- Do what?

338
00:18:34,069 --> 00:18:36,230
- I'm just here with my girl.
- Yeah, my ethics teacher.

339
00:18:36,338 --> 00:18:38,738
<i>- Hey, George Michael.
- No, Dad. I'm taking care of something, okay?</i>

340
00:18:38,841 --> 00:18:40,399
- All right.
- You slept with my ethics teacher.

341
00:18:40,509 --> 00:18:42,409
Just hang on a second.

342
00:18:42,511 --> 00:18:43,445
- It wasn't him. It's me, okay?
- Wha...

343
00:18:43,445 --> 00:18:44,969
- It wasn't him. It's me, okay?
- Wha...

344
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,572
- I've been dating your ethics teacher.
- Wow, Michael.

345
00:18:48,684 --> 00:18:51,482
I'm really touched that you'd stick up
for me after I've been so horrible to you.

346
00:18:51,587 --> 00:18:55,353
- Huh?
- You know what? Now it's time
for me to do the right thing.

347
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,593
I slept with the ethics teacher.
I'm sorry.

348
00:18:58,694 --> 00:19:02,528
- What are you talking about?
- Lindsay told me that you liked
her and I'm not proud of this...

349
00:19:02,631 --> 00:19:05,964
but... l...
Mrs. Whitehead.

350
00:19:06,068 --> 00:19:08,935
<i>In fact,
Gob mistook the civics teacher...</i>

351
00:19:09,037 --> 00:19:11,267
<i>for the ethics teacher Michael was dating.</i>

352
00:19:11,373 --> 00:19:14,433
Man, he... has a type.

353
00:19:14,543 --> 00:19:18,104
<i>Gob, Mrs. Whitehead
was the civics teacher.</i>

354
00:19:18,213 --> 00:19:21,842
- We both had her.
- Yes, we have. And now we're even.

355
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:24,009
- What a pig.
- Tell me about it.

356
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:26,349
No, you!
You're the pig!

357
00:19:26,455 --> 00:19:29,219
- Two strikes. You are out.
- Listen. Shannon, please.

358
00:19:29,324 --> 00:19:31,758
It was a onetime thing. I'm not
gonna hear from her again!

359
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,885
Ach!

360
00:19:33,996 --> 00:19:38,194
Who is Edna W? Hello?

361
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:41,292
- What's going on here, Dad?
- Well, it-it-it was me, okay?

362
00:19:41,403 --> 00:19:44,736
l-I've been seeing Ms. Baerly, and I
should never have brought Gob into it.

363
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,673
But that day you told me you liked her,
I didn't know what else to do.

364
00:19:47,776 --> 00:19:50,802
- I never wanted to hurt you.
- Didn't Aunt Lindsay tell you I liked her?

365
00:19:50,913 --> 00:19:54,371
Yeah. But she said that you wanted her as
a mother, and I said that was ridiculous...

366
00:19:54,483 --> 00:19:56,644
but then I met her
and kind of fell for her...

367
00:19:56,752 --> 00:19:59,744
and thought that she would
kind of make a great mother.

368
00:19:59,855 --> 00:20:03,382
<i>Is that true? I didn't
know you were that serious.</i>

369
00:20:03,492 --> 00:20:05,983
Well, you know, I'm open to it.
We're open to it.

370
00:20:06,094 --> 00:20:08,528
Wow!

371
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:12,396
- No, no, no, no.
- I'm just saying someday, you know.

372
00:20:12,501 --> 00:20:15,937
- I'm not really into kids.
- I'm just... I'm not trying to rush anything.

373
00:20:16,038 --> 00:20:18,063
Hey!
The lady said no, man.

374
00:20:18,173 --> 00:20:20,641
Look, Michael,
I hope you find what you're looking for.

375
00:20:20,742 --> 00:20:23,836
I mean we had some laughs about
some very sad things, but...

376
00:20:23,946 --> 00:20:26,574
I don't think we have a future.

377
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:31,877
- And, Jeremy, I will take that cupcake.
- Ohh. Okay, um...

378
00:20:33,121 --> 00:20:37,717
- Hey, uh, you wanna dance?
- Sure, why not?

379
00:20:40,629 --> 00:20:42,620
I can't believe that would have worked.

380
00:20:43,899 --> 00:20:45,457
<i>On the next
Arrested Development.</i>

381
00:20:45,567 --> 00:20:47,694
<i>Buster's competition
heats up.</i>

382
00:20:47,803 --> 00:20:50,704
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! We are not
allowed to have candles in here.</i>

383
00:20:50,806 --> 00:20:53,274
- Mom would freak.
- Oh, no, it's fine.

384
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:58,711
This is America, baby.
You pray how you want.

385
00:20:58,814 --> 00:21:01,442
I'll light a candle
of my own.

386
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,541
That's exactly
what I'll do.
