1
00:00:01,655 --> 00:00:04,556
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:04,658 --> 00:00:06,649
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,751
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:14,268 --> 00:00:15,929
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

5
00:00:19,172 --> 00:00:22,437
<i>Michael was heading off
to work when his son, George Michael...</i>

6
00:00:22,543 --> 00:00:25,273
<i>- reminded him of a yearly tradition.
- Hey, don't forget me.</i>

7
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:28,246
- For what?
- It's Bring Your Daughter to Work Day.

8
00:00:28,348 --> 00:00:30,680
And unless you had a daughter
I don't know about, I'm your girl.

9
00:00:30,784 --> 00:00:34,311
<i>Michael had first made
this joke when George Michael was six.</i>

10
00:00:34,421 --> 00:00:38,016
Well, she's not my daughter,
but it's about as close as I'm gonna get.

11
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:40,116
I'm a good little girl.

12
00:00:40,227 --> 00:00:43,025
<i>It was a joke Michael was
starting to grow concerned about...</i>

13
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:46,031
<i>- as it had not worn well with age.
- Hey, Dad.</i>

14
00:00:46,133 --> 00:00:48,533
They're out of sanitary napkins
in the ladies' washroom.

15
00:00:51,138 --> 00:00:53,197
Weird kid.

16
00:00:53,307 --> 00:00:56,276
I don't think this year's such a good idea.
You know you're getting older and...

17
00:00:56,376 --> 00:00:59,539
Yeah, right. Pretty soon I'm going to have
to start wearing a bra. Right, Dad?

18
00:00:59,646 --> 00:01:02,240
<i>- All right, give me one minute.
- Really, let's not this year.</i>

19
00:01:02,349 --> 00:01:04,909
I cannot kill this joke.

20
00:01:05,018 --> 00:01:07,384
<i>Hey, shouldn't you
be getting dressed?</i>

21
00:01:07,487 --> 00:01:11,048
- Nope. I'm going with my dad to work today.
- Hey, peanut butter cup.

22
00:01:11,158 --> 00:01:13,422
This is work?
Watching entertainment news?

23
00:01:13,527 --> 00:01:16,553
Well, excuse me, Michael, for not raising
the perfect daughter that you did.

24
00:01:16,663 --> 00:01:19,564
<i>I indulged this ritual
for years in Boston.</i>

25
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:23,602
<i>As a psychotherapist, Tobias was on
the forefront of the self-esteem movement.</i>

26
00:01:23,704 --> 00:01:27,731
There's, like, this longing, this pull.

27
00:01:27,841 --> 00:01:30,708
I mean, does that make me,
you know, like some kind of...

28
00:01:30,811 --> 00:01:34,008
- Homosexual.
- Maeby, please.

29
00:01:35,716 --> 00:01:40,119
She's right though.
You probably are a homosexual.

30
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,121
So, Maeby, this is what you're gonna do
this year? You're gonna watch him watch TV?

31
00:01:43,223 --> 00:01:45,157
<i>Behind the scenes
at Entertainment Tonight.</i>

32
00:01:45,258 --> 00:01:49,592
Oh, bless her. It's like she knew
what I was going to do next.

33
00:01:49,696 --> 00:01:53,860
<i>It's here! Girls with
- Newport Beach.</i>

34
00:01:53,967 --> 00:01:56,094
From the act I did
on the beach over spring break.

35
00:01:56,203 --> 00:01:59,104
<i>- Any magician...
- Gob had done a magic show...</i>

36
00:01:59,206 --> 00:02:02,801
<i>where he had made the Bluth
family yacht... disappear.</i>

37
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:07,710
<i>It was spring break, and the act
was filmed for the popular video series...</i>

38
00:02:07,814 --> 00:02:10,715
Girls with Low Self-Esteem.

39
00:02:10,817 --> 00:02:13,615
This puts me back on top of
the old magic career though.

40
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,711
You're not gonna put that in.
There's nudity on that.

41
00:02:15,822 --> 00:02:17,722
Maeby, why don't you go
upstairs and get dressed?

42
00:02:17,824 --> 00:02:21,157
I must warn you, Michael.
She doesn't respond well to strict directives.

43
00:02:21,261 --> 00:02:23,525
All right.

44
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:26,394
- That was odd.
- Not really. Kids love boundaries.

45
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,559
<i>Look at these girls.
Is this what you want?</i>

46
00:02:28,669 --> 00:02:31,069
- Oh, God, no.
- 'Cause this could be where
your daughter is headed.

47
00:02:31,171 --> 00:02:33,401
Oh, no, no. I don't want this
for Maeby either, no.

48
00:02:33,507 --> 00:02:35,498
Oh, here it is. Here it is.

49
00:02:35,609 --> 00:02:37,509
<i>It was a wild time on the beach.</i>

50
00:02:37,611 --> 00:02:40,512
<i>And if you like magic, look away.</i>

51
00:02:41,982 --> 00:02:45,008
<i>The only thing this guy could
make fly away was the crowd.</i>

52
00:02:45,118 --> 00:02:48,713
Douche chill.

53
00:02:48,822 --> 00:02:51,450
I can't believe they used that part.

54
00:02:51,558 --> 00:02:53,492
The one part where I screw up.

55
00:02:53,593 --> 00:02:55,720
It's not like they used the part
where I made the yacht disappear.

56
00:02:55,829 --> 00:02:58,662
Sunk the yacht.
Blew it up, sunk it.

57
00:02:58,765 --> 00:03:00,665
- We sure did.
- We? No.

58
00:03:00,767 --> 00:03:02,667
I gave you permission to use
the yacht. You blew it up.

59
00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:05,101
Yeah, well, if you give someone
permission to use a tissue...

60
00:03:05,205 --> 00:03:07,696
you can't be upset
if they blow their nose.

61
00:03:07,808 --> 00:03:10,003
Right? I mean, right?

62
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:13,341
<i>Lindsay, new outfit?</i>

63
00:03:13,447 --> 00:03:15,608
No, I've had this for years.
It's a hand-me-down from Mom.

64
00:03:15,716 --> 00:03:17,911
- Got a price tag right there.
- Is there?

65
00:03:18,018 --> 00:03:21,613
Oh, I guess she wanted me to have
something new. Sweet old thing.

66
00:03:21,722 --> 00:03:24,919
Only two of those words describe Mom,
so I know you're lying to me.

67
00:03:25,025 --> 00:03:29,428
Fine. I bought it before we went broke, okay?
I just haven't worn it yet.

68
00:03:29,529 --> 00:03:33,124
- What about the outfit yesterday?
- Old Thing gave it to me.

69
00:03:33,233 --> 00:03:36,396
- Where are you getting all the money?
- It's not costing you anything.

70
00:03:36,503 --> 00:03:38,368
Unless you're stealing or working,
I'm pretty sure it is.

71
00:03:38,472 --> 00:03:40,702
<i>That's right. I stole it.</i>

72
00:03:40,807 --> 00:03:43,469
<i>In fact, Lindsay,
tired of wearing last year's fashions...</i>

73
00:03:43,577 --> 00:03:46,774
<i>went to an upscale department store
and in a moment of desperation...</i>

74
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,644
<i>- applied for a job.
- Can I have a job application please?</i>

75
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,014
<i>But she was ashamed
ofbeing a shopgirl...</i>

76
00:03:52,119 --> 00:03:54,383
<i>and was relieved when Michael
gave her the out.</i>

77
00:03:54,488 --> 00:03:57,457
Well, they expect a certain amount of theft,
Michael. It's built into the price.

78
00:03:57,557 --> 00:04:00,390
If I didn't take it, then people
would be overpaying for nothing.

79
00:04:00,494 --> 00:04:02,394
You're telling me that you
walked into a store...

80
00:04:02,496 --> 00:04:04,464
and without anyone noticing
took an entire outfit?

81
00:04:04,564 --> 00:04:07,055
<i>There's no way that you could
do sleight ofhand that well.</i>

82
00:04:07,167 --> 00:04:09,635
- I don't even think that I could do it.
- Yeah, I've seen your tape.

83
00:04:09,736 --> 00:04:13,729
<i>- Lindsay, this is appalling.
- What'd you use for misdirection?</i>

84
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,469
- Misdirection?
- Yeah, I mean, if you're so good at magic...

85
00:04:17,577 --> 00:04:19,977
what'd you have them looking at
to divert their attention?

86
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,173
I don't know... my ass.

87
00:04:22,282 --> 00:04:24,409
- My ass. You're lying.
- No, I'm not.

88
00:04:24,518 --> 00:04:26,850
- You're gonna take that back.
- No, I'm not.

89
00:04:26,953 --> 00:04:29,649
This has nothing to do with you.
You're not my father.

90
00:04:29,756 --> 00:04:31,986
No, our father is in prison
for stealing, remember?

91
00:04:32,092 --> 00:04:34,253
<i>- Which might not be a bad place
for you to get used to.
- Michael...</i>

92
00:04:34,361 --> 00:04:36,261
it was shoplifting,
and I'm white.

93
00:04:36,363 --> 00:04:38,456
<i>- I think I'm going to be okay.
- Shoplifting?</i>

94
00:04:38,565 --> 00:04:42,296
<i>- Cool. Can you take me?
- No. Hey, not cool. You know what?</i>

95
00:04:42,402 --> 00:04:45,530
Maeby, you're gonna come with me
to work today. You're gonna be my daughter.

96
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:47,630
You're gonna have a role model
in your life who is honest...

97
00:04:47,741 --> 00:04:53,475
who doesn't steal, doesn't lie and,
I don't know, watch entertainment news.

98
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,447
Michael, don't worry about it, okay?
She's not gonna go with you.

99
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,040
- Okay.
- Great.

100
00:04:58,151 --> 00:05:00,016
That was odd.

101
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,850
I'm going to teach you two a little something
about hands-on parenting.

102
00:05:02,956 --> 00:05:04,617
<i>Hey, Dad!</i>

103
00:05:04,724 --> 00:05:07,454
Do you think this purse
goes with this outfit?

104
00:05:08,695 --> 00:05:12,995
- Where'd my dad go?
- Douche chill.

105
00:05:13,099 --> 00:05:16,296
<i>And so Michael took his niece
to Bring Your Daughter to Work Day.</i>

106
00:05:16,403 --> 00:05:18,030
You can just drop me off
at the mall.

107
00:05:18,138 --> 00:05:20,299
Oh, no, you're-you're
really coming with me.

108
00:05:20,407 --> 00:05:22,375
You're gonna learn a little
something about hard work.

109
00:05:24,678 --> 00:05:26,407
Hey, Maeby! Maeby!

110
00:05:28,682 --> 00:05:33,381
<i>Okay, so you can run faster than me.
But you can't make me work.</i>

111
00:05:33,486 --> 00:05:35,317
No one's making you
do anything, you know.

112
00:05:35,422 --> 00:05:38,721
It's just a chance for us to spend
some time together. Learn about business.

113
00:05:38,825 --> 00:05:42,420
You know, you might find that you're
good at things you didn't even know about.

114
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:48,867
See that? Who knew you were
such a good little climber?

115
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,004
Now listen,
let's make this fun, okay?

116
00:05:52,105 --> 00:05:54,005
We're family.

117
00:05:54,107 --> 00:05:56,507
What is better than hanging out
with family? Hmm?

118
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,874
Oh...
It's my mother.

119
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:01,311
- Hi.
- She called you, huh?

120
00:06:01,414 --> 00:06:03,439
I guess I'm not good enough
to be her husband.

121
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,450
What? What's going on?

122
00:06:05,552 --> 00:06:08,715
Okay. Mother wants someone
to go to my soccer game with.

123
00:06:08,822 --> 00:06:11,882
She don't want other soccer moms
think that she a single mother.

124
00:06:11,992 --> 00:06:13,026
<i>- She old school.
- I liked it better when he just said annyong.</i>

125
00:06:13,026 --> 00:06:15,460
<i>- She old school.
- I liked it better when he just said annyong.</i>

126
00:06:15,562 --> 00:06:18,156
Hey, Mom, why can't Buster
pretend to be your escort?

127
00:06:18,265 --> 00:06:21,098
- That's the way he's got it in all his cartoons.
- They already know he's my son.

128
00:06:21,201 --> 00:06:23,931
I wouldn't go even if you asked.
You didn't let me play soccer as a child.

129
00:06:24,037 --> 00:06:26,801
Why should I have to sit and cheer Annyong?
Annyong never cheers me.

130
00:06:26,907 --> 00:06:28,932
Go, fatty.

131
00:06:29,042 --> 00:06:33,035
Stop it! He's your little brother!

132
00:06:33,146 --> 00:06:35,205
No, he's not!
I came out of you! He didn't!

133
00:06:35,315 --> 00:06:38,773
Can you not call me with
these little things, please?

134
00:06:38,885 --> 00:06:41,115
The office is a mess.
I still haven't replaced Kitty.

135
00:06:41,221 --> 00:06:45,248
<i>Michael had recently fired
his father's longtime assistant, Kitty.</i>

136
00:06:45,358 --> 00:06:47,656
Did you hear that everyone?
Michael Bluth is threatening me!

137
00:06:47,761 --> 00:06:49,558
<i>- Shh, shh, shh.
- It had not been a clean break.</i>

138
00:06:49,663 --> 00:06:52,325
So, I've got a lot of work to do.
Plus, it's Bring Your Daughter to Work Day.

139
00:06:52,432 --> 00:06:55,026
- Oh, where is George Michael?
- I told him not to come.

140
00:06:55,135 --> 00:06:58,229
l-I thought it was more
important to bring Maeby this...

141
00:07:00,407 --> 00:07:03,899
Damn it! Can't you just find somebody else,
please, to look like your husband?

142
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:08,276
<i>In fact, there was someone else
who looked like Lucille's husband...</i>

143
00:07:08,381 --> 00:07:10,474
<i>- his twin brother, Oscar.
- Lucille.</i>

144
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:14,917
<i>- And although she knew it was
wrong to play with his heart...
- Oscar, it's Lucille.</i>

145
00:07:15,021 --> 00:07:17,512
<i>she really didn't want to go
to the soccer game alone.</i>

146
00:07:17,624 --> 00:07:21,424
I need you.

147
00:07:21,528 --> 00:07:23,428
<i>And back at the model home...</i>

148
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:26,158
<i>three of the Bluth men
struggled with their manliness.</i>

149
00:07:26,266 --> 00:07:28,700
You know, I make jokes about
being a daughter for my dad.

150
00:07:28,802 --> 00:07:31,862
I know I'm a man.
It's his insecurity, not mine.

151
00:07:31,972 --> 00:07:34,440
There's no security at that store.
That's how she was able to shoplift.

152
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,839
They probably don't have
a regular security guard.

153
00:07:36,943 --> 00:07:40,106
Well, of course I could get a job
as a security guard.

154
00:07:40,213 --> 00:07:42,773
I mean, if I have to have a job
to impress my daughter.

155
00:07:42,882 --> 00:07:44,782
If she needs something that butch.

156
00:07:44,884 --> 00:07:47,717
<i>Yeah. I can hang out with my uncles.
Three men. What's butcher than that?</i>

157
00:07:47,821 --> 00:07:50,449
- I'm going to the mall.
- Me too.

158
00:07:50,557 --> 00:07:53,185
Yeah, maybe a new pair
of shoes will cheer me up.

159
00:07:53,293 --> 00:07:55,955
And now I'm filling out
an expense report...

160
00:07:56,062 --> 00:07:59,395
so I can sleep well at night
knowing that I have been honest.

161
00:07:59,499 --> 00:08:01,399
You're not asleep.

162
00:08:01,501 --> 00:08:03,469
- I was.
- You were not.

163
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,834
I would like to see if you could
go one day without telling a lie.

164
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:08,965
just one whole day
without being like your mom.

165
00:08:09,075 --> 00:08:12,340
- What's in it for me if I do?
- You'll win my respect.

166
00:08:12,445 --> 00:08:14,879
- Good night.
- And 50 bucks.

167
00:08:14,981 --> 00:08:17,643
Fine. I'll do it if you do it.

168
00:08:17,751 --> 00:08:21,915
- That-a-girl. This is gonna be fun.
- I win.

169
00:08:22,022 --> 00:08:25,185
<i>- We're looking for Michael Bluth?
- That's me.</i>

170
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:28,590
- I'm Michael Bluth.
- I'm Officer Taylor. That is Officer Carter.

171
00:08:28,695 --> 00:08:32,688
Our daughters, Tammy and Moni...
Oh, God, where... where did they go?

172
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,926
- I'm on it.
- How can I help you?

173
00:08:35,035 --> 00:08:38,436
Well, we're here investigating
the disappearance of Kitty Sanchez.

174
00:08:38,538 --> 00:08:41,166
Apparently, you're the last person
to see her... alive.

175
00:08:43,176 --> 00:08:45,167
Or around town or whatever.

176
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:47,872
I don't know anything about that.
I do know that, uh...

177
00:08:47,981 --> 00:08:50,677
she was my secretary,
uh, but she left.

178
00:08:50,784 --> 00:08:52,843
<i>Or l-I fired her.</i>

179
00:08:52,952 --> 00:08:55,011
<i>Did you ever threaten her?</i>

180
00:08:55,121 --> 00:08:56,918
No, no. God, no.
Of course not.

181
00:08:57,023 --> 00:08:59,890
Michael Bluth is threatening me!

182
00:08:59,993 --> 00:09:02,291
I did. I threatened her
at a restaurant.

183
00:09:02,395 --> 00:09:07,560
- But, you know... it's a restaurant, so...
- Yep.

184
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:10,067
Certainly she's been seen since then?

185
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:13,105
Not alive.

186
00:09:13,206 --> 00:09:15,401
Or dead or whatever.

187
00:09:15,508 --> 00:09:17,567
We'd love to speak with you
down at the station.

188
00:09:17,677 --> 00:09:20,908
Sure. Uh, you know,
l-l-I'm happy to cooperate.

189
00:09:21,014 --> 00:09:23,312
But I really don't know
anything more than you know.

190
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:26,544
I certainly didn't... didn't kill her
and drop her in a back bay.

191
00:09:29,155 --> 00:09:31,316
- Boy, I hope that's not what happened to her.
- I'm sure it isn't.

192
00:09:32,826 --> 00:09:35,386
Please send Officer Davis
and Little Hanna to the back bay.

193
00:09:35,495 --> 00:09:37,554
So you killed Kitty, huh?

194
00:09:37,664 --> 00:09:39,564
No, I didn't kill Kitty.

195
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:42,260
But I will go down to the station
and answer those nice men's questions.

196
00:09:42,368 --> 00:09:46,065
You know why? Because I have no secrets
to hide. Because I'm an honest man.

197
00:09:46,172 --> 00:09:48,265
<i>And apparently a fun one.</i>

198
00:09:48,374 --> 00:09:50,308
Let's go see what's
going on in the back room.

199
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:53,140
Were those the last words
Kitty ever heard?

200
00:09:53,246 --> 00:09:55,544
No. I will not kiss her.

201
00:09:55,648 --> 00:09:59,846
Hey, hey, guys, what are you doing?
It's Bring Your Daughter to Work Day.

202
00:09:59,953 --> 00:10:02,012
<i>- Yeah, that's my Caitlin.
- Okay.</i>

203
00:10:02,122 --> 00:10:04,317
There is work to be done.
Can we get back to it? Thank you.

204
00:10:04,424 --> 00:10:08,793
Oh, and has anybody,
uh, seen or heard from Kitty lately?

205
00:10:08,895 --> 00:10:13,832
<i>I think that's her
right behind you there.</i>

206
00:10:13,933 --> 00:10:17,425
- Oh, my God. That is Kitty.
- And that's the boat that Uncle Gob blew up.

207
00:10:17,537 --> 00:10:20,938
<i>Hey, now you have something
to tell them at the station.</i>

208
00:10:26,244 --> 00:10:29,611
<i>Tobias sought out a security
position at the nearby mall.</i>

209
00:10:29,714 --> 00:10:34,276
I do know stage combat if the partner
is willing and a bit more petite than I.

210
00:10:34,386 --> 00:10:38,720
But I have a daughter to impress
and I need this job.

211
00:10:38,823 --> 00:10:42,782
Well, it's gonna be a couple of days
before we can get you a gun license...

212
00:10:42,894 --> 00:10:45,988
so you'll have to use mine.

213
00:10:46,097 --> 00:10:48,292
Wow!

214
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,801
<i>Meanwhile, Gob had taken
George Michael on a mysterious errand.</i>

215
00:10:51,903 --> 00:10:54,394
What are we getting?
Is it something for a magic trick?

216
00:10:54,506 --> 00:10:56,667
- In a way.
- That's cool.

217
00:10:56,775 --> 00:10:59,300
You know, it's so great
to be hanging out with you.

218
00:10:59,411 --> 00:11:02,642
There are certain things that I can talk to
you about that I can't really with my dad.

219
00:11:02,747 --> 00:11:06,080
<i>Like, uh, were-were you ever
awkward around girls?</i>

220
00:11:06,184 --> 00:11:10,211
What do you mean? Like if there were
three of us and I didn't know where to start?

221
00:11:10,322 --> 00:11:12,222
No, I think I did pretty well.

222
00:11:12,324 --> 00:11:14,417
Not a lot of complaints,
if you know what I mean.

223
00:11:14,526 --> 00:11:17,017
At least not from the girl.

224
00:11:17,128 --> 00:11:19,756
- You're saying I should just be myself?
- And he had to drive her home.

225
00:11:19,864 --> 00:11:22,833
So I think I did pretty good.
Pretty damn good.

226
00:11:22,934 --> 00:11:24,834
<i>- Hey, guy.
- Yes, sir?</i>

227
00:11:24,936 --> 00:11:28,372
How many mice will $13 buy?

228
00:11:28,473 --> 00:11:30,998
<i>And at the prison,
George Sr. had a surprise visit.</i>

229
00:11:31,109 --> 00:11:33,236
I just wanted to check in
and make sure you're aware...

230
00:11:33,345 --> 00:11:37,008
that your ban on organized sports
in this family has been violated.

231
00:11:37,115 --> 00:11:39,049
Ban on organized sports?

232
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:42,176
You know, how you wouldn't let me
sign up for anything when I was a kid.

233
00:11:42,287 --> 00:11:45,586
Is that what you've been
thinking all these years? No, no.

234
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:47,624
You were... You were
just a turd out there, you know?

235
00:11:47,726 --> 00:11:52,356
You couldn't kick and you couldn't run.
You know, you were just a-a turd.

236
00:11:52,464 --> 00:11:54,796
Prison has destroyed
the way you talk.

237
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:58,699
If that's what it takes to impress these guys
around here, then they are not your friends.

238
00:11:58,803 --> 00:12:02,432
Anyway, Annyong's playing soccer,
but I guess I should just ignore it.

239
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:05,737
Look the other way as Mom and Uncle Oscar
and Annyong have the perfect little family...

240
00:12:05,844 --> 00:12:08,870
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait,
wait, wait. Oscar? My brother Oscar?

241
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,881
- Oscar's been coming around?
- No touching!

242
00:12:11,983 --> 00:12:14,247
No touching. No touching.

243
00:12:14,352 --> 00:12:16,980
You listen to me. You've got to
take care of this Oscar situation.

244
00:12:17,088 --> 00:12:18,988
You get him out of there, all right?

245
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:21,923
You make him wish that he'd never
shown that ludicrous head of hair...

246
00:12:22,027 --> 00:12:24,086
and that nice face of his.

247
00:12:24,195 --> 00:12:27,722
- I will do it, Dad.
- Good. Put her there.

248
00:12:27,832 --> 00:12:29,401
- No touching!
- Oh!

249
00:12:29,401 --> 00:12:30,425
- No touching!
- Oh!

250
00:12:30,535 --> 00:12:33,470
Her self-esteem is through the roof.

251
00:12:33,571 --> 00:12:36,062
<i>And Michael arrived
at the police station with Maeby.</i>

252
00:12:36,174 --> 00:12:38,438
I got here as quickly as I could.

253
00:12:38,543 --> 00:12:40,010
<i>- I didn't know you had a daughter?
- I don't.</i>

254
00:12:40,111 --> 00:12:42,079
I thought you wanted me
to call you Daddy?

255
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:45,775
Why don't you wait
for Daddy in the car?

256
00:12:45,884 --> 00:12:49,115
- All right. What do we have here?
- Gob sunk the yacht.

257
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:52,280
The last time Kitty was seen,
she was getting onto it. It's on tape.

258
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:55,587
- Ooh! Did you see this?
- Yep.

259
00:12:55,694 --> 00:13:00,597
Ooh! Chills.
Why do I keep getting these bruises?

260
00:13:00,699 --> 00:13:02,997
- Barry!
- Okay. Until we get all the facts...

261
00:13:03,101 --> 00:13:05,467
don't say anything
that can incriminate you.

262
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:08,266
Or me. Just try to
keep me out of this.

263
00:13:08,373 --> 00:13:11,831
- Lie. Both of you.
- No, what are you talk...
We don't lie in this family.

264
00:13:11,943 --> 00:13:15,106
- Maeby, why don't you get a soda?
- Okay.

265
00:13:15,213 --> 00:13:19,582
If I lie in front of her, it costs me 50 bucks.
I do think that we should lie.

266
00:13:20,819 --> 00:13:22,719
<i>Meanwhile,
Lindsay was at work...</i>

267
00:13:22,821 --> 00:13:25,619
<i>and starting to getjealous that
her daughter was at work with Michael.</i>

268
00:13:25,724 --> 00:13:28,318
Hello, Michael. I know you think
I'm such a horrible mother...

269
00:13:28,426 --> 00:13:30,860
but I was just seeing how
my daughter was doing at work.

270
00:13:30,962 --> 00:13:35,365
Uh, she's, um, she's making
lots of friends already.

271
00:13:35,467 --> 00:13:37,958
<i>- Can you help me there, please?
- It was at this moment...</i>

272
00:13:38,069 --> 00:13:40,697
<i>that Gob and George Michael
arrived at the store.</i>

273
00:13:40,805 --> 00:13:43,968
Say what you will about America...
13 bucks stills gets you a hell of a lot of mice.

274
00:13:44,075 --> 00:13:45,975
Who said anything bad
about America?

275
00:13:46,077 --> 00:13:49,205
No. Well, I meant...
So what are the mice for?

276
00:13:49,314 --> 00:13:51,578
Oh. No, that's just for misdirection.

277
00:13:51,683 --> 00:13:55,312
We'll see who the sleight-of-hand artist
is in this family.

278
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:58,412
Okay, now when I yell "Mice!"
I want you to open this box...

279
00:13:58,523 --> 00:14:01,583
- and I'm gonna start stuffing
some shirts down your pants.
- Shirts?

280
00:14:01,693 --> 00:14:04,491
- Gob, are we shoplifting?
- Mice!

281
00:14:04,596 --> 00:14:06,826
<i>Mice! Call security!</i>

282
00:14:06,931 --> 00:14:10,924
- Michael, I'm not as bad
an influence as you think I am.
- Well, you're not a great one.

283
00:14:11,035 --> 00:14:12,969
You're a criminal, Lindsay.
What kind of message does that send?

284
00:14:13,071 --> 00:14:15,767
Bluth. We're ready to question you now.

285
00:14:15,874 --> 00:14:17,967
That's what I am, Michael.
I'm a shoplifter!

286
00:14:18,076 --> 00:14:19,976
I've got a whole bag
of clothes I shoplifted.

287
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:23,172
<i>But Tobias was now a guard.</i>

288
00:14:23,281 --> 00:14:25,408
<i>And a surprisingly catlike one.</i>

289
00:14:25,517 --> 00:14:30,420
<i>- Wow. I guess we didn't need the mice.
- Freeze...</i>

290
00:14:33,391 --> 00:14:35,757
<i>While the rest of the Bluths
were in police custody...</i>

291
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,760
<i>Lucille was with
her brother-in-law.</i>

292
00:14:37,862 --> 00:14:42,196
I am blown away that you... that you
called me and that we're-we're together.

293
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,632
And my camper made it
all the way up here.

294
00:14:44,736 --> 00:14:47,296
Do you think it's safe over there?
Because I only have a hanger for a lock.

295
00:14:47,405 --> 00:14:51,000
What are they gonna take,
the one can of Comet you've got in there?

296
00:14:51,109 --> 00:14:55,569
Oh, your tongue is as sharp
as your body is still taut.

297
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,648
What are you doing?

298
00:14:57,749 --> 00:15:02,209
Oscar, this is a children's
soccer game, not Woodstock.

299
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,552
That was another era, huh?
The music and the pot.

300
00:15:06,658 --> 00:15:10,458
Will you excuse me?
I need to go to my camper for just a quick sec.

301
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,934
Open.

302
00:15:20,438 --> 00:15:25,671
- Hey, Uncle.
- Hey, Buster.

303
00:15:28,746 --> 00:15:30,475
No, no, no.

304
00:15:30,582 --> 00:15:33,312
- No, no, no.
- No, no, no.

305
00:15:33,418 --> 00:15:37,252
No! No! No! I came here
to say something.

306
00:15:37,355 --> 00:15:40,518
You do not belong here.
My mother's been spoken for.

307
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:45,255
You know, I may never have
played organized sports, but I am a man.

308
00:15:45,363 --> 00:15:48,821
- Buster.
- And I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave.

309
00:15:50,368 --> 00:15:53,735
Okay. But, uh, I never meant
to break up your family.

310
00:15:53,838 --> 00:15:57,330
Your mom called me for a reason.
And I don't think she's happy.

311
00:15:57,442 --> 00:16:01,469
No, she's happy.
She's just mean all the time.

312
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:09,950
Uh, no, no, no, Uncle, let me get you.
I'm a man. Move.

313
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:16,116
<i>Michael submitted
to the detective's questions.</i>

314
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:18,956
You haven't seen any evidence of Ms. Sanchez
or where she might have gone?

315
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:21,997
I have, uh, no idea. None.

316
00:16:22,098 --> 00:16:24,658
Are you willing to take
a polygraph to that effect?

317
00:16:27,137 --> 00:16:31,130
- Are you nuts?
- Not without a better lawyer.

318
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:33,801
You're holding out on us!

319
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,810
Fantastic. Now Emma's awake.

320
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:39,643
- You know what? Let me take care of this.
- Please.

321
00:16:43,687 --> 00:16:47,054
Kitty had evidence against your father,
and you didn't want that to come out.

322
00:16:47,157 --> 00:16:49,819
But now you've got bigger problems,
my friend. So why don't we make a deal?

323
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:53,020
I give you evidence against my father,
and you pretend that I didn't kill Kitty?

324
00:16:53,129 --> 00:16:55,359
I mean, l-I didn't kill Kitty.

325
00:16:57,767 --> 00:17:00,497
Hello. Oh, hey,
George Michael.

326
00:17:00,604 --> 00:17:03,334
Uh, I'm sorry.
In your pants?

327
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,537
I'll be right there.
Um, my son has an emergency.

328
00:17:08,645 --> 00:17:12,046
<i>You know, there's a Grover book...
I Can't Hold It In.</i>

329
00:17:12,148 --> 00:17:15,413
Worked for us.

330
00:17:15,518 --> 00:17:19,978
<i>Buster emerged from Oscar's
trailer with a newfound sense of manliness...</i>

331
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:22,820
<i>and then received
a serendipitous gift.</i>

332
00:17:24,361 --> 00:17:27,524
Kick it back!

333
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:31,692
- If you can kick, fatty.
- I'm a man.

334
00:17:40,043 --> 00:17:43,535
What are you doing?
Get off the field!

335
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:45,706
<i>Are you crazy?</i>

336
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:05,658
<i>And Buster realized
he may havejust scared away a man...</i>

337
00:18:05,769 --> 00:18:09,762
<i>who supported him in the way
he'd always hoped his own father would.</i>

338
00:18:17,881 --> 00:18:19,508
<i>And Michael headed
over to the mall.</i>

339
00:18:19,616 --> 00:18:23,313
- So what the hell is this?
- Hey, Dad, I didn't know
we were shoplifting, okay?

340
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:25,945
Shoplifting?
What's the matter with you, Gob?

341
00:18:26,056 --> 00:18:28,320
What's the matter with me?
She's the shoplifter!

342
00:18:28,425 --> 00:18:31,223
- I wasn't shoplifting, you twit.
- Yes, thanks to me.

343
00:18:31,327 --> 00:18:33,659
No. I work here.

344
00:18:33,763 --> 00:18:37,722
At least I used to. They fired me because
they thought I was helping this idiot shoplift.

345
00:18:37,834 --> 00:18:40,530
Also, they said I wasn't
a very good salesgirl.

346
00:18:40,637 --> 00:18:43,697
You can't be serious?

347
00:18:43,807 --> 00:18:45,798
<i>A salesgirl.</i>

348
00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:48,139
I knew it! I knew you
couldn't pull it off.

349
00:18:48,244 --> 00:18:51,111
There's only one magician
in this family and that is me.

350
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:54,183
And you got caught by a 13-year-old girl.

351
00:18:54,284 --> 00:18:57,344
You know, this is why I'm constantly
asking you to stay away from my son.

352
00:18:57,454 --> 00:18:59,479
Yeah, well, it's not like you were there
to spend any time with me, Dad.

353
00:18:59,589 --> 00:19:01,523
Because I'm not daughter
enough for you.

354
00:19:01,624 --> 00:19:06,254
George Michael, um,
I'm always there for you, okay?

355
00:19:06,362 --> 00:19:09,297
It's just you're getting a little too manly
for Bring Your Daughter to Work Day.

356
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:14,166
- Dad, that's what makes it funny.
- I also wanted to give Maeby
a good role model for a change.

357
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:18,001
Yeah, well, I guess, you looking out for
her is probably something she could use.

358
00:19:18,108 --> 00:19:20,201
Where is Maeby?

359
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:22,938
<i>Michael realized he had
to get to the police station...</i>

360
00:19:23,046 --> 00:19:27,176
<i>before they got ahold of Maeby, to whom
he'd promised $50 to tell the truth.</i>

361
00:19:27,283 --> 00:19:29,308
I've put a bounty on my own head.

362
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:33,480
<i>But Maeby's instincts to lie returned.</i>

363
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,490
Hey, you can't go in there.

364
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:38,254
No, it's okay.
I'm Detective Fellows's daughter.

365
00:19:38,361 --> 00:19:42,525
Oh. Oh, sorry. It's four-three-five.
And that opens any door in the building.

366
00:19:42,632 --> 00:19:44,600
Great. Thanks.

367
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:54,169
<i>And it was there that Maeby
discovered the key to Michael's freedom.</i>

368
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:56,177
Well, I appreciate your honesty.

369
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:58,679
Maeby. What-What-What'd she say?

370
00:19:58,782 --> 00:20:01,342
I said there's a tape of Kitty getting
on the boat and that you guys blew it up.

371
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:04,215
I told them the truth,
like you told me.

372
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,413
That-a-girl.

373
00:20:06,523 --> 00:20:09,856
That's right. That's, uh, that's the truth.
That's everything that we know.

374
00:20:11,394 --> 00:20:13,362
You're free to go.

375
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:18,529
Great. Here we go.

376
00:20:22,539 --> 00:20:25,303
- What the hell just happened?
- Relax. They got nothing on you.

377
00:20:25,408 --> 00:20:28,138
They're bluffing. Kitty's alive.
I just saw her in the back room.

378
00:20:28,244 --> 00:20:31,179
They just wanted to get you scared,
so you'd testify against Pop-Pop.

379
00:20:32,348 --> 00:20:34,339
Unbelievable. Oh, that's great.

380
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:37,078
You just told them the truth;
they let us walk.

381
00:20:37,187 --> 00:20:40,520
- I guess I owe you 50 bucks, huh?
- Yeah. I'd save your money.

382
00:20:40,623 --> 00:20:43,683
Kitty's got a lot of evidence,
and she thinks that you tried to kill her.

383
00:20:43,793 --> 00:20:46,023
So you're probably going to
need a better attorney.

384
00:20:48,932 --> 00:20:51,833
<i>Lo siento.</i>

385
00:20:51,935 --> 00:20:55,234
I hate Bring Your Daughter to Work Day.

386
00:20:55,338 --> 00:20:58,068
<i>On the next
Arrested Development.</i>

387
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:02,873
<i>Tobias loses his securityjob
trying to solve the store's mice problem.</i>

388
00:21:02,979 --> 00:21:08,281
<i>Lindsay, now without a job,
goes with her initial instinct.</i>

389
00:21:08,384 --> 00:21:10,284
Mom, we're gonna
be late for practice!

390
00:21:10,386 --> 00:21:13,355
<i>- And Annyong exacts his revenge.
- Where is everybody?</i>

391
00:21:13,456 --> 00:21:15,481
<i>Heads up, fatty!</i>
