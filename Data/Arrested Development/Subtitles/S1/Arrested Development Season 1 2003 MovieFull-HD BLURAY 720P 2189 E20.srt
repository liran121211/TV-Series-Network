1
00:00:01,655 --> 00:00:04,556
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:04,658 --> 00:00:06,649
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,751
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:14,268 --> 00:00:15,929
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

5
00:00:18,906 --> 00:00:21,841
<i>Michael was preparing
for a meeting with the Bluth Company board...</i>

6
00:00:21,942 --> 00:00:24,467
<i>to decide what to do with
some recently unfrozen funds.</i>

7
00:00:24,578 --> 00:00:26,842
Wow. Exciting, huh?

8
00:00:26,947 --> 00:00:29,882
- Finally getting some money.
- What do you want, Lindsay?

9
00:00:29,983 --> 00:00:32,816
- I'd like some of that money.
- Well, this money is for land.

10
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,081
Okay? We're not gonna burn through it
like Dad did when he was in charge.

11
00:00:35,188 --> 00:00:38,180
With his bad investments,
and his corrupt dealings...

12
00:00:38,292 --> 00:00:40,192
- Mother's neck.
- No, that was a good investment.

13
00:00:40,294 --> 00:00:42,194
It is easier to look at now, isn't it?

14
00:00:42,296 --> 00:00:46,756
What if I told you that the money was
for something really worthwhile?

15
00:00:46,867 --> 00:00:48,858
- Like what?
- I want to have an affair.

16
00:00:48,969 --> 00:00:53,269
Now, I'm not sure with who yet,
but I'll need lingerie, waxings...

17
00:00:53,373 --> 00:00:55,273
These are some real costs, Michael.

18
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:59,209
- I take it things aren't
getting better with Tobias.
- What's that supposed to mean?

19
00:00:59,313 --> 00:01:02,840
<i>Things hadn't been getting
better with Michael's sister and her husband.</i>

20
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:05,578
<i>Even after she came up with
a plan to get his attention.</i>

21
00:01:05,686 --> 00:01:07,586
Oh, my God. Listen to the radio.

22
00:01:07,688 --> 00:01:11,385
<i>I haven't heard this song
since we first started dating.</i>

23
00:01:11,491 --> 00:01:15,086
I just feel like using my body.

24
00:01:15,195 --> 00:01:19,495
Well, Lindsay, could you use it over there?
I'm trying to grow.

25
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,296
Yeah. It's clear that's not gonna happen.

26
00:01:22,402 --> 00:01:25,667
We had sex once in the last year,
and he just laid there.

27
00:01:25,772 --> 00:01:27,672
All right. Look, this money is for land.

28
00:01:27,774 --> 00:01:29,674
I'm not gonna give you money
to have an affair.

29
00:01:29,776 --> 00:01:32,108
Why don't you pick something else
to boost up your self-worth?

30
00:01:32,212 --> 00:01:34,874
How about, uh, charity?
Why don't you get back to your roots?

31
00:01:34,982 --> 00:01:37,849
Well, it has been a while.
All right!

32
00:01:37,951 --> 00:01:40,511
I'm gonna go do that right now.

33
00:01:40,621 --> 00:01:42,987
You're gonna go get your hair done,
aren't you?

34
00:01:44,091 --> 00:01:46,958
Well, if I'm gonna have an affair...

35
00:01:49,062 --> 00:01:52,759
<i>Michael got a message
he intended to ignore.</i>

36
00:01:52,866 --> 00:01:54,766
<i>Until he read the next line.</i>

37
00:01:54,868 --> 00:01:58,599
<i>- A matter ofland, Mom?
- Oh, that's funny.</i>

38
00:01:58,705 --> 00:02:03,267
I meant "a matter of 'L' and 'D'..."
Life and death.

39
00:02:03,377 --> 00:02:05,208
What is the matter of life and death?

40
00:02:05,312 --> 00:02:08,110
Buster's jaw clicks when he eats.

41
00:02:08,215 --> 00:02:10,513
<i>I think it's what's
driving his friends away.</i>

42
00:02:10,617 --> 00:02:13,347
I sent him to Canada
for an operation.

43
00:02:13,453 --> 00:02:15,683
So I'll need some of that new money
that just came in.

44
00:02:15,789 --> 00:02:18,087
You know, Mom, if you want an operation
that's really gonna help him...

45
00:02:18,191 --> 00:02:20,523
you ought to have them
finally cut that cord.

46
00:02:20,627 --> 00:02:22,959
- He needs me.
- He doesn't need you.

47
00:02:23,063 --> 00:02:26,726
You coddle him. He's too old to go running
to his mommy with all his problems.

48
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:29,996
I seem to remember a certain someone...

49
00:02:30,103 --> 00:02:33,971
running to Mommy when his
algebra teacher made an example of him.

50
00:02:34,074 --> 00:02:37,942
<i>Michael had been suspended
when another boy cheated offhis test.</i>

51
00:02:38,045 --> 00:02:40,536
Tracy won't marry me.
I won't get a job, and...

52
00:02:43,016 --> 00:02:45,712
What is this?
What's happening?

53
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:47,753
Let Mama take care of it.

54
00:02:47,854 --> 00:02:52,154
I'll have a little chat
with Mr. Vandenbosch.

55
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:55,660
<i>The next day, Mr. Vandenbosch
was not in school.</i>

56
00:02:55,762 --> 00:02:58,390
<i>He was never heard from again.</i>

57
00:02:58,498 --> 00:03:03,333
I know life is not fair to women. Your children
grow up, and they don't need you anymore.

58
00:03:03,437 --> 00:03:06,873
And I seem to remember
a certain grown man...

59
00:03:06,973 --> 00:03:08,873
who completely fell apart
two weeks ago...

60
00:03:08,975 --> 00:03:12,843
<i>when I taped over the Nova special
that had the girl on it he liked.</i>

61
00:03:12,946 --> 00:03:16,177
That was Buster. That's my point.

62
00:03:19,786 --> 00:03:23,017
<i>George Michael, meanwhile,
was at the frozen banana stand...</i>

63
00:03:23,123 --> 00:03:25,023
<i>when he thought he spotted
a familiar face:</i>

64
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:28,094
Pop-Pop?

65
00:03:28,195 --> 00:03:30,789
Sorry, miss.
Pop-Pop!

66
00:03:30,897 --> 00:03:33,365
- You think you saw Pop-Pop?
- But with hair! Which is probably why...

67
00:03:33,467 --> 00:03:35,731
- he asked for my hair, remember?
- Give Pop-Pop your hair!

68
00:03:35,836 --> 00:03:38,031
- Give me the hair!
- It all adds up.

69
00:03:38,138 --> 00:03:42,074
He stole somebody's hair,
made a wig, knocked out the guard...

70
00:03:42,175 --> 00:03:44,769
tunnelled his way through a sewer line,
and then stopped to get a candy apple...

71
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:47,711
- on his way to Mexico!
- Of course!

72
00:03:47,814 --> 00:03:50,009
- You're mocking me.
- Of course.

73
00:03:50,117 --> 00:03:53,780
Listen, I know what I saw, Maeby.
And there's no other explanation.

74
00:03:53,887 --> 00:03:56,754
<i>So listen. My twin brother's in town.
I want you to take care ofhim.</i>

75
00:03:56,857 --> 00:03:59,257
- You still see Uncle Oscar?
- Tell you what.

76
00:03:59,359 --> 00:04:02,123
Give him ten grand
from the, uh, new cash.

77
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:05,460
- Just send him on his way.
- Dad, the money is for the business, okay?

78
00:04:05,565 --> 00:04:07,556
- I'm not just gonna hand it all out.
- Michael!

79
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:09,999
This is my brother. Do you know
what it's like to have a sibling...

80
00:04:10,103 --> 00:04:12,003
who has no source
of income except for you?

81
00:04:12,105 --> 00:04:15,472
just one? No. No idea.
It sounds wonderful though.

82
00:04:15,575 --> 00:04:17,839
Look, the board is watching
every move I make.

83
00:04:17,944 --> 00:04:21,937
EspeciallyJordan. He's just waiting for me to
screw up, so he can blow the whistle on me.

84
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:23,845
Why don't you just
buy him out of his stock?

85
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:26,316
No, no.
He wants twice the value. But...

86
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:28,853
Listen. Stop tellin' me what to do
with the money, please?

87
00:04:28,955 --> 00:04:32,322
I've got a plan for the board meeting that's
gonna take the gun right out ofJordan's hand.

88
00:04:32,425 --> 00:04:35,155
<i>Listen, you've got the money now.
And you know my price.</i>

89
00:04:35,262 --> 00:04:37,162
You don't need
a whistle-blower around here.

90
00:04:37,264 --> 00:04:39,664
Interesting choice of words,
Mr. Jordan.

91
00:04:39,766 --> 00:04:41,791
<i>He's right.
We don't need a whistle-blower.</i>

92
00:04:41,902 --> 00:04:45,963
We need a building full
of whistle-blowers.

93
00:04:46,072 --> 00:04:47,972
<i>Okay? Whistles.</i>

94
00:04:48,074 --> 00:04:52,033
<i>I want this place to be honest. That's
exactly why I had these made up for us.</i>

95
00:04:52,145 --> 00:04:55,478
When you see something wrong, I wa...

96
00:04:55,582 --> 00:04:58,346
There you go. I want you to report it.
I want you to...

97
00:04:58,451 --> 00:05:01,386
Exactly. Just like that.

98
00:05:01,488 --> 00:05:03,479
I want us to police ourselves as vigilant...

99
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:06,320
Let's wait till something actually happens
though. Okay, good fun.

100
00:05:06,426 --> 00:05:08,326
All right.
Hey. Enough!

101
00:05:08,428 --> 00:05:11,158
45, 46, 47...

102
00:05:11,264 --> 00:05:13,528
Okay, there's still
three whistles left out there.

103
00:05:13,633 --> 00:05:15,965
Who's got the whistles?

104
00:05:16,069 --> 00:05:18,833
- He kept one.
- There's a good example of whistle-blowing.

105
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:22,841
But you've kept yours,
so it's hurting your case.

106
00:05:22,943 --> 00:05:25,309
I was in the bathroom when you asked for it back.

107
00:05:25,412 --> 00:05:27,573
<i>- No, he wasn't.
- In any event...</i>

108
00:05:27,681 --> 00:05:29,808
we are going to be
responsible with this money.

109
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:32,214
Michael, I hope I'm not
interrupting anything...

110
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:37,086
but I'd love to get a hunk
of that new company money.

111
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:41,627
I just need to prove to my wife
that I can act like a man.

112
00:05:41,728 --> 00:05:46,097
And it's not about sex. I don't just
lie there, if that's what you're thinking.

113
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,158
<i>- That's not what I was thinking.
- Sorry, I just...</i>

114
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,864
- A quick question for Michael.
- Is this about the money?

115
00:05:52,973 --> 00:05:55,942
- No!
- What do you want?

116
00:05:56,042 --> 00:05:59,102
It's not about money in the sense that I'm
saying, "Here, Michael, take some money."

117
00:05:59,212 --> 00:06:03,012
It's just more of a "May I have some?"
kind of visit.

118
00:06:03,116 --> 00:06:05,346
<i>Don't you have a wife
that you can ask now?</i>

119
00:06:05,452 --> 00:06:06,720
- She left me.
- For Tobias?

120
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,687
- She left me.
- For Tobias?

121
00:06:07,787 --> 00:06:09,687
- For me?
- No!

122
00:06:09,789 --> 00:06:13,190
- She doesn't even like you.
- I'm in love with your brother-in-law.

123
00:06:13,293 --> 00:06:16,194
<i>You're in love with your own brother?
The one in the army?</i>

124
00:06:16,296 --> 00:06:19,356
- No. Your sister's husband.
- Michael? Michael!

125
00:06:19,466 --> 00:06:21,866
- No, that's your sister's brother.
- I'm my sister's brother.

126
00:06:21,968 --> 00:06:25,426
<i>- You're in love with me. Me!
- I'm in love with Tobias.</i>

127
00:06:25,538 --> 00:06:28,530
- My brother-in-law?
- I know it can never be. So I'm leaving.

128
00:06:28,642 --> 00:06:31,270
- I'm enlisting in the army.
- To be with your brother.

129
00:06:31,378 --> 00:06:33,608
- No!
- Anyway, I can't be expected to live...

130
00:06:33,713 --> 00:06:36,477
on the $800-a-month army-wife
stipend that I'm gonna get.

131
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,881
They just don't
support the spouses.

132
00:06:38,985 --> 00:06:43,422
You don't want to end up like Uncle Oscar,
okay? Living off handouts your whole life.

133
00:06:43,523 --> 00:06:45,388
Why don't you come up
with a way to make money?

134
00:06:45,492 --> 00:06:48,791
<i>A suggestion of something to invest in,
or maybe, uh, maybe a business idea?</i>

135
00:06:48,895 --> 00:06:51,728
<i>Well, I've always wanted
to remake Annie Hall.</i>

136
00:06:51,831 --> 00:06:56,564
Except I wouldn't want to get in bed with
a green producer like a Sofia Coppola though.

137
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:59,230
Oh, but give me an old pro,
like a Robert Redford?

138
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:02,001
Oh, I'd jump into bed
with him in a second.

139
00:07:02,108 --> 00:07:05,475
And I wouldn't just lie there,
Michael Bluth...

140
00:07:05,578 --> 00:07:08,843
- if that's what you're thinking.
- Actually, that time that was
what I was thinking.

141
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:13,750
<i>And later that day, Maeby
spotted something interesting.</i>

142
00:07:18,224 --> 00:07:22,923
<i>Lindsay, meanwhile, arrived at the salon
hoping to increase her self-esteem.</i>

143
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:26,726
<i>Unfortunately, her stylist hadjust been
called up by his reserve unit.</i>

144
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:29,267
- What's happening? Where are you going?
- I'm not allowed to tell.

145
00:07:29,369 --> 00:07:33,772
- It's the war.
- Come on! These salon wars have got to stop!

146
00:07:33,873 --> 00:07:36,501
The war, Lindsay. The real war.

147
00:07:36,609 --> 00:07:39,840
<i>Lindsay was stunned, notjust
that she was losing her stylist...</i>

148
00:07:39,946 --> 00:07:42,574
<i>but that apparently,
there was a war going on.</i>

149
00:07:42,682 --> 00:07:45,446
Well, I'm protesting this war.
You're my friend...

150
00:07:45,552 --> 00:07:47,713
and I'm not gonna let
Shauna cut my hair.

151
00:07:47,821 --> 00:07:49,880
I'm going to take a stand.

152
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:53,016
<i>And Lindsay found a solution
to her self-esteem problem.</i>

153
00:07:53,126 --> 00:07:57,085
<i>Gob and Tobias, meanwhile, were
brainstorming at a local coffee shop.</i>

154
00:07:57,197 --> 00:07:59,791
- I need a cup of coffee to focus.
- It's so crowded in here.

155
00:07:59,899 --> 00:08:04,029
I can't think. Okay.
What is it that people need?

156
00:08:04,137 --> 00:08:06,469
People love to carbo-load.

157
00:08:06,573 --> 00:08:08,871
- The bagel place.
- There you go.

158
00:08:08,975 --> 00:08:12,741
- Hey, guys. What's goin' on?
- Just researching our investment.

159
00:08:12,846 --> 00:08:15,679
Oh, yeah. Coffee places.
I've thought about these.

160
00:08:15,782 --> 00:08:19,479
I'll tell you what. You guys come up
with a proposal, we'll try one.

161
00:08:19,586 --> 00:08:21,986
<i>Gob and Tobias accidentally
had Michael on the hook...</i>

162
00:08:22,088 --> 00:08:24,556
<i>and they didn't want to blow the deal.</i>

163
00:08:32,432 --> 00:08:34,332
I guess that's a response.

164
00:08:34,434 --> 00:08:37,198
- Hey, Nephew.
- Oh, hey!

165
00:08:37,303 --> 00:08:39,203
Uncle Oscar.
How are you doin'?

166
00:08:39,305 --> 00:08:41,865
Wow, you are like, like a rock.

167
00:08:41,975 --> 00:08:44,409
- Oh, the tension! Come on.
- Oh, okay. That's plenty.

168
00:08:44,511 --> 00:08:47,173
- Okay. That's the pancreas right there.
- What's happening now?

169
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,271
<i>The two men reconnected...</i>

170
00:08:49,382 --> 00:08:52,249
<i>- neither one anxious to
bring up the issue at hand.
- One on the lips.</i>

171
00:08:52,352 --> 00:08:56,015
Obviously, Dad's in prison now. I'm running
the business a little bit differently.

172
00:08:56,122 --> 00:08:58,249
- You do the best with what you have.
- Yeah.

173
00:08:58,358 --> 00:09:02,021
- I have lemons, I make lemonade.
- That's a very positive attitude.

174
00:09:02,128 --> 00:09:05,757
I hate the lemonade business. I hate the grind.
You have to grind so many...

175
00:09:05,865 --> 00:09:07,890
- lemons.
- You're not a very metaphorical person,
are you?

176
00:09:08,001 --> 00:09:10,765
- I need money.
- I know.

177
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:14,101
Ah, I cannot tell you how
that has weighed on me.

178
00:09:14,207 --> 00:09:16,437
Mm.

179
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:20,309
Why don't we sit over here?

180
00:09:20,413 --> 00:09:25,316
So I've got too many people
watching me too closely.

181
00:09:25,418 --> 00:09:29,377
So, if you're willing to work,
or if you have something of value...

182
00:09:29,489 --> 00:09:32,083
The only thing I have
of value is my land.

183
00:09:32,192 --> 00:09:34,786
I could give you the rights to
"All You Need Are Smiles."

184
00:09:34,894 --> 00:09:38,125
<i>That was a song I wrote for David Cassidy; he
was gonna sing it on The Mike Douglas Show.</i>

185
00:09:38,231 --> 00:09:40,825
But he was too embarrassed
to do it in front ofJohn and Yoko.

186
00:09:40,934 --> 00:09:44,392
- Tell me about the land.
- It's a couple hundred acres...

187
00:09:44,504 --> 00:09:46,734
of lemon groves,
right near Camp Pendleton.

188
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,308
If you're willing to part
with that land, Uncle Oscar...

189
00:09:49,409 --> 00:09:52,776
I can guarantee you a little bit more
than that $10,000.

190
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:56,781
<i>To be honest, I've often thought of
giving it up to pursue my... my lost love.</i>

191
00:09:58,017 --> 00:10:00,212
The love that was taken from me.

192
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,756
I hope that was the espresso machine.

193
00:10:03,857 --> 00:10:06,417
<i>Michael made the trip
to survey the land.</i>

194
00:10:06,526 --> 00:10:09,324
<i>It was, indeed, beautiful.</i>

195
00:10:09,429 --> 00:10:12,626
<i>And the next day, he went
to his father to tell him.</i>

196
00:10:12,732 --> 00:10:14,632
- You give that gift to my brother?
- Gift? No.

197
00:10:14,734 --> 00:10:17,532
I did not give him a gift. I told you.
The money was for investing...

198
00:10:17,637 --> 00:10:20,197
- and that's exactly what I did with it, Pop.
- Oh, Michael!

199
00:10:20,306 --> 00:10:22,638
This guy has got nothing in his life.
He wrote one song that...

200
00:10:22,742 --> 00:10:25,939
madeJoan Baez call him
"the shallowest man in the world."

201
00:10:26,045 --> 00:10:29,674
He has a worthless piece of property
and, yes, a head of hair...

202
00:10:29,782 --> 00:10:31,875
only because he's never
had to work for a living.

203
00:10:31,985 --> 00:10:35,546
- Wait. What piece of property's worthless?
- The grove. Where he lives.

204
00:10:35,655 --> 00:10:38,886
I mean, you can't build on it.
The government has an easement on it.

205
00:10:38,992 --> 00:10:41,620
- Does Oscar know this?
- Of course he knows it.

206
00:10:41,728 --> 00:10:44,253
I mean, they run their...
their tanks through there.

207
00:10:44,364 --> 00:10:46,992
Occasionally, they stop for
a little lemonade, but what's that?

208
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,193
That's a buck fifty.
You can't make much from that.

209
00:10:49,302 --> 00:10:53,398
<i>Indeed, the land was valueless.</i>

210
00:10:53,506 --> 00:10:57,704
Fellas! Fellas!

211
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:00,540
So. Tell me about
this investment you made.

212
00:11:05,149 --> 00:11:07,674
<i>Back at the model home,
Lindsay had decided...</i>

213
00:11:07,785 --> 00:11:10,549
<i>not to take her stylist's
departure lying down.</i>

214
00:11:10,655 --> 00:11:14,147
I'm protesting the war.
There's a war going on, you know?

215
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:16,988
Yeah, I'm the one who told you, and
you said it happened ten years ago.

216
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:19,324
Hey, isn't this the same sign you used
to picket the cable company...

217
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:22,194
- when they dropped the Style Network?
- Actually, I used this one...

218
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,860
for Michael when he was too cheap
to pay for the premium channels.

219
00:11:24,969 --> 00:11:27,767
But I added the bit
about the stylists.

220
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,740
You know that secret you have?

221
00:11:31,842 --> 00:11:33,901
The one about the hair
that nobody's supposed to see?

222
00:11:34,011 --> 00:11:37,344
- Hai...
- I saw it.

223
00:11:37,448 --> 00:11:40,281
- Oh.
- I saw Pop-Pop.

224
00:11:40,384 --> 00:11:42,614
Oh, right.
Pop-Pop with hair.

225
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,746
- You know, I should tell my dad about...
- No, you...

226
00:11:45,856 --> 00:11:48,017
He might need us to help him,
so we should go check out the prison...

227
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,252
and make sure he's not there.

228
00:11:50,361 --> 00:11:54,525
Oh. Hey, you know, I got cable.
You won that one!

229
00:11:54,632 --> 00:11:57,692
<i>Michael was embarrassed about
the bad investment he'd made...</i>

230
00:11:57,802 --> 00:11:59,895
<i>and was hoping
to keep it a secret.</i>

231
00:12:00,004 --> 00:12:03,132
Hi, this is Oscar. I'm off,
pursuing my lady love.

232
00:12:03,241 --> 00:12:05,869
Leave a message.
I'll get back to you next summer.

233
00:12:05,977 --> 00:12:08,605
Hey, it's Michael. I know that you think
that you've disappeared...

234
00:12:08,713 --> 00:12:11,045
but I will find you.

235
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:13,309
<i>- Who's disappeared?
- No one.</i>

236
00:12:13,417 --> 00:12:15,578
- Why do you ask? Have you seen someone?
- I've seen no one.

237
00:12:15,686 --> 00:12:18,484
<i>- Then you haven't seen anyone
that looks like Pop-Pop.
- No. Why?</i>

238
00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:21,422
<i>Has someone... who looks
like Pop-Pop disappeared?</i>

239
00:12:21,525 --> 00:12:24,119
No. Course not.

240
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:28,393
Have you seen the agricultural report?

241
00:12:28,499 --> 00:12:32,731
Nothing's hotter than coffee,
so... the trend is up.

242
00:12:32,837 --> 00:12:34,737
So, if we could get
that check from you...

243
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:37,501
I'm not just gonna
hand out a check, okay?

244
00:12:37,608 --> 00:12:39,508
You gotta come up
with an investment plan.

245
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:43,239
- You gotta call...
- Oh, we've got an investment plan.

246
00:12:43,347 --> 00:12:45,611
- "Gobias Industries."
- Go bias.

247
00:12:45,716 --> 00:12:47,843
- Hmm?
- As in, "Go buy us some coffee."

248
00:12:49,053 --> 00:12:51,078
It's great. Looks good.

249
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:54,123
So, when do I start
makin' my moneys?

250
00:12:54,225 --> 00:12:59,993
Well, um, there, uh... there may not be
as much investment capital as we thought.

251
00:13:00,097 --> 00:13:03,328
Uh, money's kind of
tied up in this land deal.

252
00:13:03,434 --> 00:13:07,768
This is the first any of us at Gobias
Industries have heard of a land deal.

253
00:13:07,872 --> 00:13:11,103
<i>- We could borrow on that land.
- There's not much to borrow against.</i>

254
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,142
The deal seems to be bad.

255
00:13:13,244 --> 00:13:16,441
<i>It's Uncle Oscar's land,
and it may be worthless.</i>

256
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:19,107
- And the board okayed it?
- They weren't notified.

257
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:22,652
Damn it! Every time,
Dad does this to us.

258
00:13:22,753 --> 00:13:26,280
- Gob, Dad really wasn't...
- He went around you, around the board...

259
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,984
- He steamrolled Gobias.
- Yeah, what are you gonna do?

260
00:13:29,093 --> 00:13:31,459
Go down to that prison
and give him a piece of my mind.

261
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:33,553
- You don't need to do that.
- No, I'm doing it!

262
00:13:33,664 --> 00:13:35,655
No, because you're in charge now.
And I'm telling him that.

263
00:13:35,766 --> 00:13:38,098
No, no, no, no.
Listen, Gob, he's human.

264
00:13:38,202 --> 00:13:42,798
He's a human being, and... let-let me try
to get us out of this, you know?

265
00:13:42,907 --> 00:13:46,638
Let me just see if I can get Dad out of this
mess that he has created for himself, okay?

266
00:13:46,744 --> 00:13:51,113
I'm afraid... this offer
comes off the table...

267
00:13:51,215 --> 00:13:53,240
at midnight tonight.

268
00:13:53,351 --> 00:13:55,979
Maybe the worst bluff
I've ever seen.

269
00:13:56,087 --> 00:13:59,887
<i>Even the members of Gobias
agreed on that one.</i>

270
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:04,518
<i>The next day, Lindsay, having heard
about a military exercise...</i>

271
00:14:04,628 --> 00:14:08,655
<i>joined a protest group and went off to
exercise her own First Amendment rights.</i>

272
00:14:08,766 --> 00:14:11,098
This way! Thank you!

273
00:14:11,202 --> 00:14:13,136
Right here. This way.

274
00:14:13,237 --> 00:14:16,035
I ask you to make sure you're fully inside
the free speech zone...

275
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:19,132
- before beginning your protest.
- Free speech zone?

276
00:14:19,243 --> 00:14:21,711
This is where we're protesting?
This isn't right. Where are the cameras?

277
00:14:21,812 --> 00:14:24,406
<i>They're in the free press zone, and if
you could save your comments until...</i>

278
00:14:24,515 --> 00:14:26,949
you're completely loaded into the cage...

279
00:14:27,051 --> 00:14:29,815
Well, at least the procession will come
through here. They'll see us protest.

280
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,889
Actually, they're using their right
to cut through the lemon grove.

281
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:35,254
Okay, have fun, enjoy
your right to free speech.

282
00:14:35,359 --> 00:14:37,520
The armed forces
welcomes your dissent.

283
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:40,495
Well, hopefully somebody
will come by we can protest.

284
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:48,365
My grandkids. What a surprise.

285
00:14:48,472 --> 00:14:51,566
- Oh, he's here.
- Of course I'm here. Where else would I be?

286
00:14:51,675 --> 00:14:54,872
Well, we thought you broke out of prison
and were on the lam with stolen hair.

287
00:14:54,979 --> 00:14:58,039
Don't you think that if I got out of here,
I might want to go home?

288
00:14:58,149 --> 00:15:01,585
That's what we thought. But then my dad
told us about that lemon grove you bought...

289
00:15:01,685 --> 00:15:03,585
- and we thought you were going there.
- Yeah, but don't worry.

290
00:15:03,687 --> 00:15:06,383
We would never blow the whistle on family.

291
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:09,323
What lemon grove?

292
00:15:09,427 --> 00:15:11,418
<i>And so, Michael went back to the board...</i>

293
00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:13,895
<i>to take responsibility for his mistake.</i>

294
00:15:13,998 --> 00:15:17,263
My dad screwed up. He bought something
that he shouldn't have.

295
00:15:17,368 --> 00:15:19,666
But I guess... guess that's why
he's behind bars.

296
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:23,297
Yeah. And he's not allowed to conduct
any business from there.

297
00:15:23,407 --> 00:15:27,241
Right, yeah.
I was involved. It wasn't all his decision.

298
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:30,245
You see, it was his idea, and then
I carried out the transaction.

299
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:33,908
That's even worse.
Conspiracy to commit fraud.

300
00:15:34,018 --> 00:15:36,282
'Course, you can always
buy me off the board.

301
00:15:36,387 --> 00:15:38,446
We don't have the money anymore.

302
00:15:38,556 --> 00:15:41,116
And I assure you that nothing
illegal has happened here.

303
00:15:41,225 --> 00:15:43,125
I've misspoke.

304
00:15:43,227 --> 00:15:46,663
My dad in no way is talking
about business from prison.

305
00:15:46,764 --> 00:15:49,062
<i>Excuse me.
Your father's calling from prison.</i>

306
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:52,533
He wants to talk about the land deal
you made with his brother.

307
00:15:52,636 --> 00:15:55,537
I found this on your desk. Can I keep this?

308
00:15:59,412 --> 00:16:04,145
<i>Back at the free speech zone, Lindsay's
protest had started to gain some attention.</i>

309
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,150
<i>But not from any key decision makers.</i>

310
00:16:06,252 --> 00:16:09,744
- Thought we were seein' a gay marriage.
- We can still hose 'em down.

311
00:16:09,856 --> 00:16:11,915
What do we want?

312
00:16:12,025 --> 00:16:14,152
<i>What do we want?</i>

313
00:16:16,329 --> 00:16:18,263
Where's everyone going?

314
00:16:18,364 --> 00:16:21,800
<i>- What, are you giving up?
- Face it, Lindsay. They've won.</i>

315
00:16:21,901 --> 00:16:23,801
Well, I'm not going anywhere!

316
00:16:23,903 --> 00:16:27,134
All your water's doing is
whetting my appetite for protest.

317
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,004
No hair for oil!
No hair for oil!

318
00:16:30,109 --> 00:16:32,100
Fine! We'll drown you out with music.

319
00:16:32,212 --> 00:16:36,114
Crank it up! I'm in the mood to dance!

320
00:16:40,987 --> 00:16:44,821
<i>And Lindsay discovered that
the activism that came out...</i>

321
00:16:44,924 --> 00:16:48,985
<i>ofher desire for prettier hair
really did boost her self-esteem.</i>

322
00:16:49,095 --> 00:16:51,256
<i>While Michael,
with nowhere else to turn...</i>

323
00:16:51,364 --> 00:16:53,798
<i>made a rare, unsolicited visit
to his mother's.</i>

324
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,800
<i>- Michael?
- Yeah.</i>

325
00:16:55,902 --> 00:16:58,996
I hope you're here to bring me
a check for Buster's surgery.

326
00:16:59,105 --> 00:17:02,370
They made him stop eating after midnight,
and he's hungry, and he's in a foreign land...

327
00:17:02,475 --> 00:17:04,807
and his jaw is clicking,
and he's scared.

328
00:17:04,911 --> 00:17:08,142
- I don't have the money. All right, Mom?
- Then why are you here?

329
00:17:08,248 --> 00:17:10,216
I don't know.
I don't know.

330
00:17:14,854 --> 00:17:17,687
So, how's work?

331
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:20,554
It's-It's not great, Mom, since you asked.

332
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,821
It's-It's just...
It's not that great, you know?

333
00:17:22,929 --> 00:17:24,988
I got a board member
who's trying to extort me...

334
00:17:25,098 --> 00:17:28,534
and a seller I can't find... this whole
real estate thing is a total mess...

335
00:17:28,635 --> 00:17:30,830
- I got Dad completely...
- What did your father do?

336
00:17:30,937 --> 00:17:33,269
- Did he try to screw something up
for you again?
- No, no.

337
00:17:33,373 --> 00:17:35,307
<i>He didn't screw anything up.
I screwed something up, Mom.</i>

338
00:17:35,408 --> 00:17:39,367
l-I did it, and Dad is just,
you know, furious at me.

339
00:17:39,479 --> 00:17:42,107
And he should be, you know? He told me
to pay off his brother, and I didn't.

340
00:17:42,215 --> 00:17:44,206
Instead, I bought his worthless land.

341
00:17:44,317 --> 00:17:46,842
- With the lemons and the tanks?
- I know it!

342
00:17:46,953 --> 00:17:50,013
First investment I made with the company
money, and it's a total disaster.

343
00:17:50,123 --> 00:17:53,092
Then I went ahead and lied about it,
which is gonna let this board member...

344
00:17:53,192 --> 00:17:55,422
bring the company down...
I'm gonna ruin this family...

345
00:17:55,528 --> 00:17:58,292
Mom...

346
00:17:58,398 --> 00:18:00,457
What's this? What's happening?

347
00:18:00,567 --> 00:18:03,764
- It's going to be all right.
- Why are you squeezing me with your body?

348
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:05,861
It's a hug, Michael.
I'm hugging you.

349
00:18:05,972 --> 00:18:08,634
- Why?
- Because you need your mother right now.

350
00:18:08,741 --> 00:18:12,108
But I don't get along with my...
Sorry. That was a knee jerk.

351
00:18:12,211 --> 00:18:16,079
Michael. You made a mistake.
You're a human being.

352
00:18:16,182 --> 00:18:19,549
But you're so forgiving
to everyone else in this family.

353
00:18:19,652 --> 00:18:21,586
Try being forgiving to yourself.

354
00:18:21,688 --> 00:18:24,179
Now, if you'll excuse me.

355
00:18:26,025 --> 00:18:28,289
<i>- Let Mama take care of it.
- No, no.</i>

356
00:18:28,394 --> 00:18:31,227
Mom, come on. I don't want you to do
anything. Hey! This isn't algebra.

357
00:18:31,331 --> 00:18:34,323
<i>I'm a big boy. Mother!
Do not make somebody dis...</i>

358
00:18:34,434 --> 00:18:37,597
disappear.

359
00:18:46,879 --> 00:18:52,010
<i>Now there's someone who could have
used a good mother. Whore!</i>

360
00:18:52,118 --> 00:18:56,987
<i>And so, before Oscar could
leave to find his lady love...</i>

361
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:59,422
<i>- Oscar!
- She found him.</i>

362
00:18:59,525 --> 00:19:03,757
Lucille!
You look fantastic!

363
00:19:03,863 --> 00:19:06,195
You still have the neck
of a 20-year-old.

364
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:09,462
And you still have the hair of a lion.

365
00:19:09,569 --> 00:19:13,437
Take back the land.

366
00:19:13,539 --> 00:19:17,475
That's it?
But l-I thought we could have...

367
00:19:17,577 --> 00:19:21,274
this brief moment to... reconnect.

368
00:19:21,381 --> 00:19:24,282
Oscar. Your brother
is in jail right now.

369
00:19:24,384 --> 00:19:27,876
- My husband is in jail.
- You're right.

370
00:19:27,987 --> 00:19:30,217
So what's the rush?

371
00:19:33,993 --> 00:19:36,461
<i>- And, the next day...
- Michael!</i>

372
00:19:36,562 --> 00:19:39,030
Hey, Mom! Hi. Listen.

373
00:19:39,132 --> 00:19:41,600
I'm sorry about yesterday.
It was a moment of weakness.

374
00:19:41,701 --> 00:19:44,636
Now l-I gotta go into this board meeting.
I'm just gonna tell them the truth.

375
00:19:44,737 --> 00:19:47,297
If this guyJordan wants to try to get
me fired, then maybe I deserve it.

376
00:19:47,407 --> 00:19:50,137
He's gone.
We bought out his shares.

377
00:19:50,243 --> 00:19:55,146
- With what?
- With the money you tried to spend
on that lemon grove.

378
00:19:55,248 --> 00:19:57,182
You got it back. How?

379
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,523
You know about what I was saying about
how people outlive their usefulness?

380
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:08,651
- That was out of line.
- I know.

381
00:20:08,761 --> 00:20:10,956
But you made a good point.

382
00:20:11,064 --> 00:20:14,761
Maybe I do need something to occupy
my time, other than my children.

383
00:20:14,867 --> 00:20:17,665
Well, if you do want to spend it
together, it's fine with me.

384
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:20,898
I'm so glad to hear that.

385
00:20:26,446 --> 00:20:28,914
All right.

386
00:20:29,015 --> 00:20:31,176
<i>Let's get this meeting started.</i>

387
00:20:31,284 --> 00:20:35,618
Why have we been spending
so much money on whistles?

388
00:20:38,024 --> 00:20:40,219
<i>On the next
Arrested Development...</i>

389
00:20:40,326 --> 00:20:43,523
<i>Michael finds having his mother
on the board problematic.</i>

390
00:20:43,629 --> 00:20:47,360
- We have to be courageous.
- I remember a young man who used to say...

391
00:20:47,467 --> 00:20:50,527
<i>"But I don't have bad dreams in your bed!"</i>

392
00:20:50,636 --> 00:20:53,366
That was Buster.

393
00:20:53,473 --> 00:20:56,636
- I want to be...

394
00:20:56,743 --> 00:21:00,702
a cage dancer.

395
00:21:00,813 --> 00:21:04,408
<i>And Oscar comes a-courtin.</i>

396
00:21:04,517 --> 00:21:06,542
What's that racket?

397
00:21:16,162 --> 00:21:18,062
<i>Smile.</i>

398
00:21:19,162 --> 00:21:59,062
