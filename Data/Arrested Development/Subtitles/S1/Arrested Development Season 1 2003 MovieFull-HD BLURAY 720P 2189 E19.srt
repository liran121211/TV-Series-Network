1
00:00:01,655 --> 00:00:04,556
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:04,658 --> 00:00:06,649
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,751
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:14,268 --> 00:00:15,929
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

5
00:00:18,238 --> 00:00:18,338
<i>Michael was meeting...</i>

6
00:00:18,338 --> 00:00:20,135
<i>Michael was meeting...</i>

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,299
<i>with the company's accountant,
Ira Gilligan.</i>

8
00:00:22,409 --> 00:00:24,434
Anyway, I have gone over this
10 different ways...

9
00:00:24,545 --> 00:00:28,208
and you're reporting income on an account
that... You know, it is just freezing in here.

10
00:00:28,315 --> 00:00:30,249
Well, the thermostat
is in my office.

11
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:33,251
While it's freezing in here, it's still
hot in there. So please continue.

12
00:00:33,353 --> 00:00:36,754
There's basically no money where it
should be. I think I'm catching a cold.

13
00:00:36,857 --> 00:00:39,587
- You're not catching a cold.
- I know my body.

14
00:00:40,861 --> 00:00:43,295
- There's no money in the account?
- I'm sorry.

15
00:00:43,397 --> 00:00:46,389
- This is like the bayou in here.
- I tried to tell you that.

16
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,298
I guess I just had
to find out for myself.

17
00:00:49,403 --> 00:00:53,100
Anyway, this isn't the first
discrepancy with your father's books.

18
00:00:53,206 --> 00:00:55,504
With this court case coming up,
I just have to warn you...

19
00:00:55,609 --> 00:00:57,702
if they ask me to testify,
I am not gonna lie.

20
00:00:57,811 --> 00:00:59,711
<i>- No one's asking you to lie.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

21
00:00:59,813 --> 00:01:01,781
You're asking Gilligan
not to lie?

22
00:01:01,882 --> 00:01:04,476
Please call me Ira.
I don't like Gilligan.

23
00:01:04,585 --> 00:01:06,553
Who doesn't like Gilligan?

24
00:01:06,653 --> 00:01:09,383
Is it cold in here?

25
00:01:09,489 --> 00:01:11,980
So, listen. You have been married two
weeks now. It seems to be sticking.

26
00:01:12,092 --> 00:01:13,889
And let's pretend
it's a good thing.

27
00:01:13,994 --> 00:01:16,053
I guess this makes me
your best man...

28
00:01:16,163 --> 00:01:19,894
and I would like to throw you
a bachelor party.

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,298
Yeah, I don't think
she'd go for that.

30
00:01:22,402 --> 00:01:25,667
Besides, I talked to Dad. He said it was
stupid to get married in the first place.

31
00:01:25,772 --> 00:01:29,071
And he's right. He's right.
I've gotta get rid of her.

32
00:01:29,176 --> 00:01:32,634
You know, l... I said two weeks ago that
I thought it was a stupid idea.

33
00:01:32,746 --> 00:01:34,441
Suddenly Dad says it
and it's good advice?

34
00:01:34,548 --> 00:01:36,607
You know you don't have to do
everything Dad says.

35
00:01:36,717 --> 00:01:39,185
I don't do everything Dad says. He just
happens to be right about this.

36
00:01:39,286 --> 00:01:41,846
<i>You can help me
get rid ofher though.</i>

37
00:01:41,955 --> 00:01:44,446
Mom's having a cocktail party. She'll be
there. Maybe you can try to break us up.

38
00:01:44,558 --> 00:01:46,924
- I can't do that.
- Why not? You did it with me and Marta.

39
00:01:47,027 --> 00:01:49,757
<i>You had no problem with that, guy.
You know what? Lie to her.</i>

40
00:01:49,863 --> 00:01:52,593
Tell her that I'm
insensitive and unreliable.

41
00:01:52,699 --> 00:01:56,430
Something about how
you can never confront people.
You need someone to clean up your messes.

42
00:01:56,536 --> 00:01:58,868
See, that's great. And that's just
off the top of your head.

43
00:01:58,972 --> 00:02:01,202
<i>Michael, Gob. I was just
in the neighborhood.</i>

44
00:02:01,308 --> 00:02:04,004
Good Lord.
It is sweltering in here.

45
00:02:05,045 --> 00:02:07,639
As you may
or may not know...

46
00:02:07,748 --> 00:02:10,216
Lindsay and I have hit
a bit of a rough patch.

47
00:02:10,317 --> 00:02:13,115
<i>- Really? When did that start?
- Well...</i>

48
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,155
I don't want
to blame it all on 9/11...

49
00:02:16,256 --> 00:02:17,951
<i>but it certainly
didn't help.</i>

50
00:02:18,058 --> 00:02:20,253
But anyway, I need your help.
If you could possibly...

51
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,294
Could we go back
to your office, please?

52
00:02:22,396 --> 00:02:25,229
I just want to be
a family again.

53
00:02:25,332 --> 00:02:29,393
I guess what I'm saying is
I want to reunite the band.

54
00:02:29,503 --> 00:02:32,131
<i>- Oh, no.
- "Oh, no"was right.</i>

55
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,141
<i>In the mid '90s, Tobias formed a folk
music group with Lindsay and Maeby...</i>

56
00:02:36,243 --> 00:02:40,873
<i>called Dr. Fünke's 100% Natural
Good-Time Family-Band Solution.</i>

57
00:02:40,981 --> 00:02:44,576
<i>The group was underwritten by
the Natural Life Food Company...</i>

58
00:02:44,685 --> 00:02:48,519
<i>a division of Chem Grow, an Allyn-Crane
acquisition, and part of the Squimm Group.</i>

59
00:02:48,622 --> 00:02:52,080
<i>Their motto was simple.
"We keep you alive."</i>

60
00:02:55,962 --> 00:02:57,896
Zanotab may cause
dry mouth, hair loss...

61
00:02:57,998 --> 00:03:01,593
an overly alert feeling, and in some
cases may diminish your sex drive.

62
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:05,070
Well, there's a wellness
convention in town...

63
00:03:05,172 --> 00:03:08,164
and I thought maybe you could talk
Lindsay into joining me up onstage.

64
00:03:08,275 --> 00:03:12,678
<i>- Yeah. Why don't you ask her?
- Oh, I would, but she just
doesn't take me seriously.</i>

65
00:03:14,481 --> 00:03:17,678
<i>Michael tried to find the
money the accountant said was missing.</i>

66
00:03:17,784 --> 00:03:19,979
I don't know.
I probably stole it.

67
00:03:20,087 --> 00:03:22,351
I mean, if he says
it's missing, it is.

68
00:03:22,456 --> 00:03:25,050
Unless he stole it.
Hey, maybe he stole it.

69
00:03:25,158 --> 00:03:28,423
- He's the one that said it's missing.
- Yeah, I probably stole it.

70
00:03:28,528 --> 00:03:31,224
Well, we need to find it
before Ira is asked to testify.

71
00:03:31,331 --> 00:03:33,265
- I thought we were talking
about Gilligan. Who's Ira?
- Ira Gilligan.

72
00:03:33,366 --> 00:03:35,698
Ira's his first name.
He actually hates to be called Gilligan.

73
00:03:35,802 --> 00:03:38,032
Well,
he never told me that.

74
00:03:38,138 --> 00:03:41,539
Gilligan has promised me that all
this money will be saved in I.R.A.s.

75
00:03:41,641 --> 00:03:44,633
- It's Ira, sir.
- Oh, I'm sorry, Gilligan.

76
00:03:44,745 --> 00:03:47,646
Will be saved in "Iras."

77
00:03:47,748 --> 00:03:49,978
- What the hell is this, Gilligan?
- It's Ira, sir.

78
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:52,244
- Please call me...
- Gilligan!

79
00:03:52,352 --> 00:03:54,479
Michael, if he testifies,
I am screwed.

80
00:03:54,588 --> 00:03:58,456
Here's what you do. You take him
out for some fishing or something.

81
00:03:58,558 --> 00:04:00,890
- Why would I take him fishing?
- Fun. Guy fun.

82
00:04:00,994 --> 00:04:03,724
- Let's get him on our side.
- No. Look. I'm not taking him fishing.

83
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,127
Oh, that's right.
You hated fishing.

84
00:04:05,232 --> 00:04:07,723
- No, I didn't.
- No, I'll get Gob. Yeah. He liked it.

85
00:04:07,834 --> 00:04:09,961
- Hang on a second.
- He's the one who's fun.

86
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:12,834
I liked fishing.
Where are you going? I'm fun.

87
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:14,907
It's just that...
Listen.

88
00:04:15,008 --> 00:04:17,977
The way to fix this Ira thing
is not to buy him off. All right?

89
00:04:18,078 --> 00:04:21,536
- It's to find out where the money went.
- You're no fun.

90
00:04:21,648 --> 00:04:23,809
Yeah.
I'm plenty fun.

91
00:04:26,286 --> 00:04:28,413
<i>That night
the family gathered at Lucille's...</i>

92
00:04:28,522 --> 00:04:30,581
<i>to welcome Gob's wife.</i>

93
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:33,955
I have always wanted a daughter.

94
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,085
And a blonde.
What fun.

95
00:04:36,196 --> 00:04:39,290
<i>- Where did Annyong get thatjuice box?
- Annyong.</i>

96
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:42,857
Those are for his soccer team. No sugar
for you. You just get more awful.

97
00:04:45,972 --> 00:04:48,099
Hey, Adopted Brother.

98
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:50,267
Do you think I could have a hit
of that juice box? That...

99
00:04:59,252 --> 00:05:01,311
<i>Michael tried
to convince Lindsay to rejoin...</i>

100
00:05:01,421 --> 00:05:05,619
<i>Dr. Fünke's 100% Natural
Good-Time Family-Band Solution.</i>

101
00:05:05,725 --> 00:05:10,059
Dr. Fünke's 100% Natural Good-Time
Family-Band Solution was a nightmare for me.

102
00:05:10,163 --> 00:05:14,031
Hmm. Well, he said it was
the most fun your family's ever had.

103
00:05:14,134 --> 00:05:17,035
Yeah, well, I was wacked
on Zanotab the entire time.

104
00:05:17,137 --> 00:05:19,367
I thought Zanotab was supposed
to make everything a little bit better.

105
00:05:19,472 --> 00:05:23,431
For 15 minutes. Then it burns when
you pee, and your marriage goes to hell.

106
00:05:23,543 --> 00:05:27,070
It is not a good supplement. Besides,
Maeby's not gonna want to do it.

107
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,671
<i>I wanna do it!
Are you kidding me?</i>

108
00:05:29,783 --> 00:05:31,876
<i>Those were
our best times ever.</i>

109
00:05:31,985 --> 00:05:35,352
This party just keeps
gettin' better.

110
00:05:35,455 --> 00:05:39,050
So, uh... You know, if you want me
on wood block, I can keep perfect time.

111
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:41,423
Some call me
the human metronome.

112
00:05:41,528 --> 00:05:44,190
You notice how I'm always on time?
I'm never late for things.

113
00:05:44,297 --> 00:05:46,891
Yeah, but I think punctuality
is slightly different from rhythm.

114
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,834
No, it's not. It's the exact same thing.
It's knowing how long things take.

115
00:05:50,937 --> 00:05:55,397
Look. I'm just doing this because if my
parents split up, it's a lot more work for me.

116
00:05:55,508 --> 00:05:58,238
I know.
They split up once in Boston.

117
00:05:58,345 --> 00:06:01,007
<i>When they get along,
I get tons more alone time.</i>

118
00:06:01,114 --> 00:06:03,412
<i>When they don't, guess who
they start spending all their time with.</i>

119
00:06:03,516 --> 00:06:07,008
- Me.
- We've been talking here
for 28 seconds. Just so you know.

120
00:06:10,056 --> 00:06:12,081
<i>Excuse me.
Dr. "Funky?"</i>

121
00:06:12,192 --> 00:06:16,891
- Ah, Fünke.
- Of Dr. Fünke's 100% Natural
Good-Time Family-Band Solution?

122
00:06:16,997 --> 00:06:19,761
- Yes!
- Oh, my... I saw you in '96.

123
00:06:19,866 --> 00:06:23,302
- Oh!
- You sang a song about
a supplement called Teamocil?

124
00:06:23,403 --> 00:06:25,633
- Teamocil.
- I mean, you just nailed me!

125
00:06:25,739 --> 00:06:28,970
It was like you knew every side effect
I was going through at that time.

126
00:06:35,181 --> 00:06:37,376
- Sadly, Teamocil has been discontinued.
- Oh.

127
00:06:37,484 --> 00:06:40,009
The sense of wellness
it created in relationships...

128
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,556
was merely the first sign of
complete pituitary shutdown.

129
00:06:43,657 --> 00:06:45,557
- Excuse me? Are you, uh... Hi. I'm Michael.
- Hi.

130
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:48,594
- I'm Gob's brother.
- Yes. He told me all about you.

131
00:06:48,695 --> 00:06:51,789
- You have a terrific voice.
- I smell olives!

132
00:06:51,898 --> 00:06:53,889
<i>And Michael, as per Gob's request...</i>

133
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,935
<i>tried to convince his wife
that Gob was unreliable.</i>

134
00:06:57,037 --> 00:06:59,301
So, Gob is late. But I guess
that's who you married.

135
00:06:59,406 --> 00:07:02,239
He's probably out trying to do
something very important.

136
00:07:02,342 --> 00:07:06,904
Are you hitting on me?
Gob said that would happen.

137
00:07:11,418 --> 00:07:14,148
Hey, Gob. It's a good thing
you're not staying married to this girl.

138
00:07:14,254 --> 00:07:18,520
You've got her hating me... at least your
version of me, which is actually you.

139
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:24,029
Well, I talked to Dad,
and he thinks that I should stay in it.

140
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:27,930
Stay in the marriage? You're not letting Dad
lead you around by the nose again, are you?

141
00:07:28,034 --> 00:07:32,164
Think about it. I've got the marriage
and none of the good parts.

142
00:07:32,272 --> 00:07:35,173
It's like, so far it's been
all chain and no ball.

143
00:07:35,275 --> 00:07:37,766
- Sure.
- So, we'll have a ceremony and a bachelor party.

144
00:07:37,877 --> 00:07:40,812
A bachelor party?
You want one now? Come on.

145
00:07:40,914 --> 00:07:44,042
- You're not giving your best man
a whole lot of prep time.
- Dad can handle it.

146
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:48,712
- Dad?
- Yeah. You know.

147
00:07:48,822 --> 00:07:50,813
He's a fun guy, and...

148
00:07:50,924 --> 00:07:54,325
- I'm making him my best man.
- You're making Dad your best man. That's great.

149
00:07:54,427 --> 00:07:56,327
I guess
being your brother...

150
00:07:56,429 --> 00:07:59,023
and solving all your problems for you
doesn't qualify me as your best man.

151
00:07:59,132 --> 00:08:03,193
Hey. If he wants to support me,
I'm not gonna tell him to go to hell.

152
00:08:03,303 --> 00:08:06,466
- Don't worry. You're still...
- What? Invited?

153
00:08:06,573 --> 00:08:09,974
No, I was gonna say you're still the guy
I want solving my problems, but, yeah...

154
00:08:10,076 --> 00:08:12,874
Let me talk to Dad
about that invite situation.

155
00:08:19,651 --> 00:08:21,881
<i>The next day, Gob visited his father...</i>

156
00:08:21,987 --> 00:08:23,887
<i>to prepare
for his bachelor party.</i>

157
00:08:23,989 --> 00:08:26,014
You know, I really think
that you're gonna like this woman.

158
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:29,492
Well, she's costing me enough, but she's...
oh, she's a hell of a stripper.

159
00:08:29,595 --> 00:08:31,324
- No, I mean my wife.
- Oh.

160
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,921
Well, l... I doubt that
very much.

161
00:08:34,033 --> 00:08:38,834
Well, I can tell you that Michael was
pretty upset that you wanted to be best man.

162
00:08:38,937 --> 00:08:43,067
- Don't worry about Michael.
- Yeah, my bachelor party's about having fun, right?

163
00:08:43,175 --> 00:08:46,872
No, no. Your bachelor party's about convincing
Gilligan that he's killed a stripper...

164
00:08:46,979 --> 00:08:48,970
getting him out of town
so he can't testify...

165
00:08:49,081 --> 00:08:51,379
<i>and making sure that people think
that he took the money.</i>

166
00:08:51,483 --> 00:08:53,348
- It is?
- Yeah.

167
00:08:53,452 --> 00:08:57,218
This accountant can do us a lot of damage.
I want him neutralized. Do you hear me?

168
00:08:57,322 --> 00:09:01,884
That's why I want you to use this stripper...
a narcoleptic, believe it or not.

169
00:09:01,994 --> 00:09:05,896
A friend of mine at the yacht club,
he used her for his bachelor party.

170
00:09:05,998 --> 00:09:09,365
We wanted you
to have the first piece!

171
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:16,130
You put her in a darkened space,
she's out.

172
00:09:16,241 --> 00:09:18,072
You get him drunk.
He passes out.

173
00:09:18,177 --> 00:09:22,443
Then you cover the floor with corn syrup,
mixed with a little red dye.

174
00:09:22,548 --> 00:09:26,109
He comes to. "Eee! Blood! Aaah!"
He freaks out.

175
00:09:26,218 --> 00:09:28,118
Okay. But how do you know
that he's gonna leave the country?

176
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:31,553
That's why I got you those honeymoon
tickets. You never thanked me for those.

177
00:09:31,657 --> 00:09:33,591
I'm sorry. I meant to. I was gonna...

178
00:09:33,692 --> 00:09:36,388
You just have to convince him
that this happened.

179
00:09:36,495 --> 00:09:39,328
- That he killed a stripper?
- Can you do this?

180
00:09:39,431 --> 00:09:41,592
Can I trust you? You're not
gonna go all Michael on me, are ya?

181
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,600
Nobody's turning
all Michael on you.

182
00:09:43,702 --> 00:09:46,671
But when you get out, then we're gonna
have a real party. Right, Dad?

183
00:09:46,772 --> 00:09:48,672
Are you kidding?
When I get out of here...

184
00:09:48,774 --> 00:09:51,174
you're gonna throw me the biggest
party this town's ever seen.

185
00:09:51,276 --> 00:09:53,574
All right?

186
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:55,647
<i>Back at the model home...</i>

187
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:00,817
Stop!
It is not Zanotab.

188
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:03,752
Well, maybe if I was allowed to have
a Zanotab, I'd remember it's Euphorazine.

189
00:10:03,856 --> 00:10:07,348
No. We are not going to do that again.
This family is not about to start using.

190
00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:09,757
We are pushers,
not takers.

191
00:10:09,862 --> 00:10:13,958
Okay. Once more, from the bridge.

192
00:10:17,603 --> 00:10:19,503
What is that noise?

193
00:10:19,605 --> 00:10:22,199
We don't need
the wood block.

194
00:10:22,307 --> 00:10:25,037
No, I just thought
I would join in on the fun.

195
00:10:25,144 --> 00:10:28,341
I mean, you guys are always talking about,
you know, family and loving and...

196
00:10:28,447 --> 00:10:30,039
having good times
in the circle...

197
00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:32,049
You know what?
This isn't working.

198
00:10:32,151 --> 00:10:34,676
Maybe I'm just gonna go off
and rehearse with Maeby alone.

199
00:10:34,786 --> 00:10:36,811
Oh, fine. Then I'll rehearse
with Maeby after dinner.

200
00:10:38,323 --> 00:10:41,554
No! This is wholesome,
family fun, okay?

201
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:44,390
Let's take it from loose stool!
One, two and a...

202
00:10:44,496 --> 00:10:46,396
What is that in your mouth?
Is that a Euphorazine?

203
00:10:46,498 --> 00:10:48,398
Lindsay, spit it out!
That's not real happiness!

204
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,060
- Well, it's better than what we've got now.
- Lindsay, spit it out!

205
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:53,001
<i>And Michael arrived home...</i>

206
00:10:53,105 --> 00:10:55,903
<i>determined to prove
that he was, in fact, fun.</i>

207
00:10:56,008 --> 00:10:58,033
I just booked us
a little fishing trip.

208
00:10:58,143 --> 00:11:01,601
- But why? What did I do?
- Hmm? No, no. This is a fun thing!

209
00:11:01,713 --> 00:11:03,738
Okay? Something I've always
wanted to do with you.

210
00:11:03,849 --> 00:11:06,147
Everybody's always having fun
around here. Why can't we?

211
00:11:06,251 --> 00:11:10,745
<i>Already down! Get
your finger out of my throat! It's down!</i>

212
00:11:10,856 --> 00:11:14,348
- Anyway, I thought you hated fishing.
- No, it's fun. I like fun.

213
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:19,021
I just hated doing it with my dad.
This is gonna be you and me. Okay?

214
00:11:19,131 --> 00:11:23,227
We get to stay at a hotel, get up at
4:00 a.m., slap on the old seasick patch.

215
00:11:23,335 --> 00:11:26,998
We're gonna get out there on the choppy ocean.
We're gonna catch ourselves a little lunch.

216
00:11:27,105 --> 00:11:29,505
Oh, we get to eat it?

217
00:11:29,608 --> 00:11:32,099
After we gut it.

218
00:11:32,211 --> 00:11:33,906
Yes.

219
00:11:34,012 --> 00:11:36,606
<i>While the Bluth boys
contemplated having fun...</i>

220
00:11:36,715 --> 00:11:39,878
<i>Lucille had a request
for Gob's bachelor party.</i>

221
00:11:39,985 --> 00:11:42,783
- Why do I have to bring him?
- Because Buster's your brother...

222
00:11:42,888 --> 00:11:47,120
and I'm not gonna leave him home alone
with all this J-U-l-C-E around.

223
00:11:47,226 --> 00:11:50,093
I can spell, Mom.
You spelled "juice."

224
00:11:50,195 --> 00:11:52,755
Oh, you're so brilliant.
Let's see you find it.

225
00:11:52,864 --> 00:11:56,425
Besides, I'm going to Annyong's
soccer award ceremony...

226
00:11:56,802 --> 00:11:58,736
<i>Annyong.</i>

227
00:12:04,576 --> 00:12:05,577
And I don't need the other soccer moms
knowing how old my first batch of kids are.

228
00:12:05,577 --> 00:12:09,035
And I don't need the other soccer moms
knowing how old my first batch of kids are.

229
00:12:09,147 --> 00:12:11,638
<i>- Yeah, I think they're gonna know
that Annyong's...
- Annyong.</i>

230
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,878
Would somebody please tell
this insufferable child to...

231
00:12:14,987 --> 00:12:16,716
God!

232
00:12:16,822 --> 00:12:18,722
<i>And so, as Michael and his son...</i>

233
00:12:18,824 --> 00:12:20,883
<i>checked into the hotel,
his brothers arrived.</i>

234
00:12:20,993 --> 00:12:24,554
- What are you guys doing here?
- Oh, we're having Gob's bachelor party.

235
00:12:24,663 --> 00:12:27,996
You're not going? Even Dad's coming...
Via satellite.

236
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,729
Uh, no. I'm gonna go fishing with my son
here. We're gonna go have some fun.

237
00:12:31,837 --> 00:12:36,934
Real fun. Okay? Not everything is
strippers and booze and buckets of blood.

238
00:12:37,042 --> 00:12:39,738
<i>Why do you guys
have buckets ofblood?</i>

239
00:12:39,845 --> 00:12:41,904
It's not real blood.
It's corn syrup and red dye.

240
00:12:42,014 --> 00:12:44,676
- Juice.
- We have unlimited juice?

241
00:12:44,783 --> 00:12:48,981
This party is gonna be off the hook.

242
00:12:51,123 --> 00:12:54,456
<i>Meanwhile, at the wellness
convention in the very same hotel...</i>

243
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:58,495
<i>Dr. Fünke's 100% Natural Good-Time
Family-Band Solution...</i>

244
00:12:58,597 --> 00:13:00,565
<i>was preparing for their show.</i>

245
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:03,191
Here are the new
Euphorazine side effects.

246
00:13:03,302 --> 00:13:07,466
<i>Ah, the solo. That is for my lovely
and talented daughter.</i>

247
00:13:07,572 --> 00:13:09,870
"Delayed irritability?"
What do they mean by delayed?

248
00:13:09,975 --> 00:13:13,172
It means it comes later! This is ridiculous!
Why do we even have to do this?

249
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:16,475
We are doing this
to keep our family together.

250
00:13:16,581 --> 00:13:19,709
No, I'm serious.
We're dressed like we're in the '60s.

251
00:13:19,818 --> 00:13:22,981
- It's the 21 st century.
We should be dressing like it's the '80s.
- Lindsay...

252
00:13:23,088 --> 00:13:26,114
I'm tired of trying to find happiness
through lies and self-medicating.

253
00:13:26,224 --> 00:13:29,216
If you need me,
I'll be at the bar.

254
00:13:29,328 --> 00:13:31,228
Well, fine, Lindsay.
That's fine.

255
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:34,561
- Maeby and I'll just do...
- Yeah. I'm out too.

256
00:13:37,936 --> 00:13:41,895
You think you can handle it alone? 'Cause
if you don't perform, we don't validate.

257
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:48,135
<i>Back in Michael's hotel room...</i>

258
00:13:48,246 --> 00:13:50,441
<i>the guys were settling down
for the night...</i>

259
00:13:50,548 --> 00:13:53,278
<i>so as to be ready
for their 4:00 a.m. wake-up call.</i>

260
00:13:53,384 --> 00:13:56,148
It sure sounds like they're
having fun out there by the pool.

261
00:13:56,254 --> 00:13:59,781
Oh, they think they're having fun,
Son, but it's not lasting fun.

262
00:13:59,891 --> 00:14:03,452
It is fleeting fun,
like a bachelor party.

263
00:14:05,096 --> 00:14:10,159
What we got here is lasting fun.
Okay? You think about that.

264
00:14:10,268 --> 00:14:13,567
- Good night, Son.
- Good night, Dad.

265
00:14:13,671 --> 00:14:16,435
<i>- Marco!
- Polo!</i>

266
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,441
<i>Marco!</i>

267
00:14:18,543 --> 00:14:21,307
<i>- Polo!
- Marco!</i>

268
00:14:21,412 --> 00:14:25,212
<i>- Hey, Dad?
- Polo!</i>

269
00:14:25,316 --> 00:14:28,774
- Dad, are you still awake?
- Still awake.

270
00:14:28,886 --> 00:14:31,116
It's just, um...

271
00:14:31,222 --> 00:14:33,520
I mean, this is really fun
and everything...

272
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:36,593
This isn't even the fun part.
Tomorrow...

273
00:14:36,694 --> 00:14:38,719
Yeah.

274
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:41,321
The problem I'm having
is, uh...

275
00:14:41,432 --> 00:14:45,596
- I have a pretty finely tuned internal clock...
- Mm-hmm.

276
00:14:45,703 --> 00:14:48,069
which is why I'm actually
such a good natural percussionist.

277
00:14:48,172 --> 00:14:50,732
<i>And, um...</i>

278
00:14:50,842 --> 00:14:53,003
I'm just worried that I'm not
gonna be able to fall asleep...

279
00:14:53,111 --> 00:14:55,602
for another two hours
and 45 minutes.

280
00:14:55,713 --> 00:14:59,046
So, I was thinking maybe I would
go down and check out Maeby's band...

281
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:01,618
and you could go see if Gob's
bachelor party has started.

282
00:15:01,719 --> 00:15:04,950
Shh, shh, shh.
I'm right where I want to be.

283
00:15:05,056 --> 00:15:07,115
<i>Gob had his chance
to have me there...</i>

284
00:15:07,225 --> 00:15:08,692
but if you're sure
that you can't sleep.

285
00:15:08,793 --> 00:15:12,194
It's just... I don't know when I'm gonna
get another chance like this...

286
00:15:12,296 --> 00:15:14,196
- you know, to be there for family.
- Right.

287
00:15:14,298 --> 00:15:17,995
- I'd hate to miss it, because I was too proud.
- Right.

288
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,139
Wait a minute. "Too proud?" What does
this have to do with "too proud?"

289
00:15:26,244 --> 00:15:28,542
Actually, that part
was kinda just for you.

290
00:15:28,646 --> 00:15:33,879
I was just worried the whole thing wasn't gonna
land unless I included the pride part.

291
00:15:33,985 --> 00:15:36,385
<i>Upstairs, Gob was
preparing to set up the accountant...</i>

292
00:15:36,487 --> 00:15:39,388
<i>under his father's
helpful gaze.</i>

293
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:41,890
<i>- Who called the cops?
- And with the aid of some helpful gays.</i>

294
00:15:41,993 --> 00:15:43,893
You told me to hire people
to look like my friends.

295
00:15:43,995 --> 00:15:46,122
<i>They're Hot Cops.
They're entertainers.</i>

296
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:49,757
<i>Although I specifically asked them
not to come dressed as cops.</i>

297
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:53,564
You better change now. He's gonna be
here soon. Butch, guys. I want it butch.

298
00:15:53,671 --> 00:15:55,571
Hey, uh,
you got the blood. Right?

299
00:15:55,673 --> 00:15:58,608
Yeah, I got two buckets full right... Hey!
What the hell happened to the blood?

300
00:16:00,745 --> 00:16:03,737
<i>- Hey, Brother.
- Whoa!</i>

301
00:16:03,848 --> 00:16:07,079
<i>- Somebody put on his lipstick in the car.
- I love juice!</i>

302
00:16:07,185 --> 00:16:11,747
This next number is the only ballad
that the Solution ever attempted.

303
00:16:11,856 --> 00:16:14,188
And I must say
I feel a bit like a Mary...

304
00:16:14,292 --> 00:16:18,092
without a Peter and a Paul,
but I suppose it's worth a shot.

305
00:16:51,262 --> 00:16:53,321
"Teamocil is
no longer available.

306
00:16:53,431 --> 00:16:56,127
<i>Please try either Grouphug, Bondat
or consult your own Wellness Guide."</i>

307
00:16:56,234 --> 00:16:58,532
Teamocil!

308
00:17:01,405 --> 00:17:03,635
You're out of the band.

309
00:17:03,741 --> 00:17:05,766
<i>And, back at the bachelor party...</i>

310
00:17:05,877 --> 00:17:09,176
<i>Gilligan had arrived,
and the con was in full swing.</i>

311
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,577
It's Ira,
and I'm fine.

312
00:17:10,681 --> 00:17:12,706
Come on! Have a drink!

313
00:17:12,817 --> 00:17:15,581
There's some stuff coming up you
might not be able to handle sober.

314
00:17:15,686 --> 00:17:19,087
Speaking of which,
where's Buster?

315
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:21,090
<i>In fact, Buster had finished thejuice...</i>

316
00:17:21,192 --> 00:17:23,353
<i>and was desperately looking
for his next sugar fix...</i>

317
00:17:23,461 --> 00:17:25,395
<i>when he discovered the cake
in the next room.</i>

318
00:17:25,496 --> 00:17:29,956
<i>Unfortunately, he was unaware of the
narcoleptic stripper confined within it.</i>

319
00:17:33,871 --> 00:17:36,032
Yeah, I better go in the
back room and have a look for him.

320
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:39,940
<i>- Ira, have a drink!
- I'm not thirsty. I want some food.</i>

321
00:17:40,044 --> 00:17:42,205
<i>Ooh.</i>

322
00:17:42,313 --> 00:17:44,213
Okay. Keep it together.
Don't go all Michael here.

323
00:17:44,315 --> 00:17:47,011
Knock, knock!
Where's the married bachelor?

324
00:17:47,118 --> 00:17:49,518
Michael, I thought you weren't coming.
I thought he wasn't coming!

325
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:53,215
Well, I wasn't going to, but he's my
brother, and I'm here to support him...

326
00:17:53,324 --> 00:17:58,523
like all these, uh,
hot men and Ira.

327
00:17:58,629 --> 00:18:01,689
Well, you're not gonna stay.
I mean, this isn't your kind of scene.

328
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:05,257
Dad, please, stay out of it, all right? I'm
here for Gob. Now, where are the strippers?

329
00:18:05,369 --> 00:18:05,536
- Well, l...
- Mmm! You got a little back room going, huh?

330
00:18:05,536 --> 00:18:07,800
- Well, l...
- Mmm! You got a little back room going, huh?

331
00:18:07,905 --> 00:18:09,805
- Huh? Huh?
- Well...

332
00:18:09,907 --> 00:18:13,434
just relax. I'm as fun as anybody.
I can handle a back room.

333
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:17,809
- I'm calling the cops.
- No!
- We're changing again, guys!

334
00:18:17,915 --> 00:18:20,713
- No. No cops.
- Well, what is this?

335
00:18:22,053 --> 00:18:24,214
She died.
She's dead.

336
00:18:24,322 --> 00:18:27,052
<i>- It was Gilligan!
- What?</i>

337
00:18:27,158 --> 00:18:29,058
Gilligan killed
the skipper... stripper.

338
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,060
I didn't kill
any stripper.

339
00:18:31,162 --> 00:18:33,255
- You're drunk. You don't remember.
- You're pulling the rip cord!

340
00:18:33,364 --> 00:18:37,460
Ira, take my honeymoon tickets.
Get out of the country. Save yourself.

341
00:18:37,568 --> 00:18:41,231
- I'm not drunk. Bix made me the designated driver.
- Bix!

342
00:18:41,339 --> 00:18:43,637
<i>Just then, the stripper woke up...</i>

343
00:18:43,741 --> 00:18:46,107
<i>saw Buster with what appeared
to be blood around his mouth...</i>

344
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:49,304
<i>- and thought she had killed him for groping her.
- Not again.</i>

345
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,820
You were setting me up.

346
00:18:57,922 --> 00:18:59,947
You're trying to get me
to leave the country.

347
00:19:00,057 --> 00:19:02,787
Well, the hell with you, sir.
Bix, we're leaving.

348
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:05,521
I'm testifying.

349
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:08,121
<i>Yeah, the party's over. That's it.</i>

350
00:19:08,232 --> 00:19:10,200
You were trying
to set Ira up?

351
00:19:10,301 --> 00:19:13,270
<i>Oh, Gob, Gob.
Come on. Is this true?</i>

352
00:19:13,371 --> 00:19:15,999
Oh, wait a minute.
It wasn't your idea, Gob.

353
00:19:16,107 --> 00:19:18,940
- It was your idea. Wasn't it, Dad?
- It wa...

354
00:19:19,043 --> 00:19:21,477
- Huh?
- Even if it was my idea, which it wasn't...

355
00:19:21,579 --> 00:19:25,174
Gob screwed it up,
which he did and always does.

356
00:19:25,282 --> 00:19:27,682
- You don't have to take that.
- What the hell am I supposed to do?

357
00:19:28,819 --> 00:19:31,117
Here.

358
00:19:32,723 --> 00:19:38,025
- Oh, no. No, no. Don't you dare, mister.
- Do it. Do it.

359
00:19:38,129 --> 00:19:40,723
<i>Hey, Gob! I am your best man.
I am your fath...</i>

360
00:19:44,068 --> 00:19:47,902
What does it matter?
I screwed it up anyway. A complete failure.

361
00:19:48,005 --> 00:19:50,803
<i>Can't even fake the death
of a stripper.</i>

362
00:19:50,908 --> 00:19:53,570
Oh, come on.
That's not a bad thing.

363
00:19:53,678 --> 00:19:56,306
<i>- It doesn't make you a failure. Dad's the failure.
- Really?</i>

364
00:19:56,414 --> 00:19:59,383
When he was my age, he ran
an entire company, had kids.

365
00:19:59,483 --> 00:20:02,748
The company was corrupt.
Look what he's trying to do to us.

366
00:20:02,853 --> 00:20:04,753
<i>I'll tell you something else.
You might not be a father...</i>

367
00:20:04,855 --> 00:20:06,846
but you are my brother.

368
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,319
I might be a father.

369
00:20:13,097 --> 00:20:15,190
Why don't you start trusting
yourself. Okay? Not Dad.

370
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:17,267
You're a much better man
than he is.

371
00:20:17,368 --> 00:20:20,166
- You're a better man than both of us.
- Well.

372
00:20:20,271 --> 00:20:24,002
You're the best man.
You're my best man.

373
00:20:24,108 --> 00:20:27,100
Not if I have an actual ceremony,
'cause Dad would kill me, but...

374
00:20:27,211 --> 00:20:30,544
<i>What do you say, hermano?
Help me clean up this mess?</i>

375
00:20:30,648 --> 00:20:32,513
What the hell.

376
00:20:33,818 --> 00:20:36,878
Gob, I want out.

377
00:20:36,987 --> 00:20:39,114
- I'm in love with your brother.
- What?

378
00:20:39,223 --> 00:20:41,817
- You did it again, you son of a bitch!
- No, no! She's...

379
00:20:44,395 --> 00:20:46,192
In-law. Tobias.

380
00:20:47,498 --> 00:20:49,295
Sorry. I should have
finished that thought.

381
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,891
<i>On the next Arrested Development.</i>

382
00:20:52,002 --> 00:20:53,765
Oh, my god.
I killed Michael.

383
00:20:53,871 --> 00:20:56,237
Yeah, but on the plus side,
you got punched in the face.

384
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:00,242
Hey, Brother.
Hey, Brother.

385
00:21:00,344 --> 00:21:02,744
<i>Michael solves
the mystery of the missing money.</i>

386
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:06,715
Ira was signatory to all these accounts?

387
00:21:06,817 --> 00:21:09,251
<i>- Get me Ira Gilligan.
- And Gilligan...</i>

388
00:21:09,353 --> 00:21:12,379
<i>fulfills his destiny.</i>

389
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:16,049
<i>Let it ring.</i>
