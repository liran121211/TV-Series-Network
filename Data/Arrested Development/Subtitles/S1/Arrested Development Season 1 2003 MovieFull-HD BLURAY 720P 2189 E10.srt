1
00:00:00,653 --> 00:00:04,111
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:04,224 --> 00:00:06,624
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:06,726 --> 00:00:08,785
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,100
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,241
<i>Michael Bluth was
talking to his son about his latest test.</i>

6
00:00:24,344 --> 00:00:26,403
- A-minus, huh?
- Proud of me?

7
00:00:26,513 --> 00:00:29,710
Very proud...
minus.

8
00:00:29,816 --> 00:00:33,013
Better go hit the books again.
Get up there.

9
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:37,249
C-minus.
"C" M-l-N-E-S.

10
00:00:37,357 --> 00:00:40,019
- Did you even study?
- No, I didn't.

11
00:00:40,126 --> 00:00:43,323
Wow. How impressive is that?

12
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,991
The bar for the refrigerator
has been lowered, huh?

13
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,000
Oh, grades are meaningless.

14
00:00:49,102 --> 00:00:51,161
Maeby's last school didn't
even have them.

15
00:00:51,271 --> 00:00:52,966
<i>Back in Boston...</i>

16
00:00:53,073 --> 00:00:55,064
<i>Maeby's parents had enrolled her
in a progressive school...</i>

17
00:00:55,175 --> 00:00:57,905
<i>with its own system of evaluation.</i>

18
00:00:58,011 --> 00:01:00,605
All I'm saying is that you might want
to push her a little bit.

19
00:01:00,713 --> 00:01:03,546
A kid without discipline
can get into some pretty tough stuff.

20
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:06,448
You think she's gonna suddenly
turn to drugs 'cause she got a C-plus?

21
00:01:06,553 --> 00:01:10,216
<i>Minus. And, yes, I think that, without
boundaries, a kid can get into trouble.</i>

22
00:01:10,323 --> 00:01:12,223
Yeah, sometimes
that could mean drugs.

23
00:01:12,325 --> 00:01:14,418
I think stress
is what leads to trouble...

24
00:01:14,527 --> 00:01:17,462
the kind you put on George Michael,
even when he gets an "A."

25
00:01:17,564 --> 00:01:20,897
<i>Minus. An "A" gets him ice cream.
He knows that.</i>

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,798
You're as bad as Dad
with his ridiculous lessons.

27
00:01:23,903 --> 00:01:26,929
<i>George Sr. had used his considerable means...</i>

28
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,201
<i>to stage intricate scenarios...</i>

29
00:01:29,309 --> 00:01:32,210
<i>to teach his children
what he considered valuable life lessons.</i>

30
00:01:32,312 --> 00:01:34,280
- I need help.
- I'll get my gear.

31
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,942
<i>Typically, these scenarios would
involve a man named J. Walter Weatherman...</i>

32
00:01:39,052 --> 00:01:40,986
<i>a one-time employee
who lost his arm...</i>

33
00:01:41,087 --> 00:01:44,215
<i>in a Bluth Company construction accident.</i>

34
00:01:44,324 --> 00:01:46,758
<i>- Why are you hitting yourself?
Why are you hitting yourself?
- We're out of milk.</i>

35
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,125
I could have got it earlier if someone
would have left a note.

36
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:52,892
Oh.

37
00:01:56,202 --> 00:01:58,636
Why? If someone
had left a note...

38
00:01:58,738 --> 00:02:01,229
this-this innocent man
would still have his arm.

39
00:02:01,341 --> 00:02:04,401
Why?

40
00:02:04,511 --> 00:02:08,470
And that's why
you always leave a note.

41
00:02:08,581 --> 00:02:12,915
<i>Those lessons worked, didn't they?
We still leave notes to this day.</i>

42
00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:14,987
Oh, that's what that was about.

43
00:02:15,088 --> 00:02:17,420
I thought he was trying
to get us off dairy.

44
00:02:17,524 --> 00:02:20,493
- I need a favor.
- What happened to, "Hello. I need a favor"?

45
00:02:20,593 --> 00:02:23,255
I owe Hot Cops 500 bucks.

46
00:02:23,363 --> 00:02:26,298
- "Hot Cops"?
- It's the stripping agency I used to work for.

47
00:02:26,399 --> 00:02:28,264
- Cop uniform.
- Right.

48
00:02:28,368 --> 00:02:30,427
I might have been
just a little too believable.

49
00:02:34,407 --> 00:02:37,774
Police! Open up!

50
00:02:45,952 --> 00:02:48,182
Anyway, they're claiming
that I never delivered on the gig.

51
00:02:48,288 --> 00:02:51,621
- I'm not an A.T.M.
- I keep forgetting how hilarious you are.

52
00:02:51,724 --> 00:02:54,284
- Shh, shh, shh! You're making it worse.
- Am I?

53
00:02:54,394 --> 00:02:57,886
I'm gonna give you the cash, but, in return,
I get to ask you for a favor sometime.

54
00:02:57,997 --> 00:03:02,297
My gut is telling me "No,"
but my gut is also very hungry.

55
00:03:02,402 --> 00:03:05,064
All right. I'll do it.

56
00:03:05,171 --> 00:03:07,867
<i>Michael then left
for his mother's apartment...</i>

57
00:03:07,974 --> 00:03:11,205
<i>where she greeted him with
some not-so-surprising news.</i>

58
00:03:11,311 --> 00:03:13,973
- I need a favor.
- We ought to put that on our family crest.

59
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,674
- Oh, Michael...
- Spare me.

60
00:03:16,783 --> 00:03:20,947
The S.E.C. is making me
inventory everything I own.

61
00:03:21,054 --> 00:03:24,080
They want me to prove no new purchases
have been made with company money.

62
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:27,523
- And there haven't been, right?
- Not after we doctor all these receipts.

63
00:03:27,627 --> 00:03:29,527
I can't help you, Mom.
I've got a job.

64
00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:31,995
I gotta make some money so you can
buy more things and destroy the evidence.

65
00:03:32,098 --> 00:03:35,158
You're right.
I'll ask Lindsay.

66
00:03:37,203 --> 00:03:38,932
<i>- Hey, Buster.
- Hey, Brother.</i>

67
00:03:39,038 --> 00:03:42,667
- You headed over to your girlfriend's?
- Yeah. She's down again.

68
00:03:42,775 --> 00:03:47,610
<i>Buster's girlfriend, Lucille Austero,
suffers from chronic vertigo...</i>

69
00:03:47,714 --> 00:03:51,206
<i>which she has been trying to fight
without the use of medication.</i>

70
00:03:51,317 --> 00:03:54,684
Her nausea's gotten really bad.
It's really been difficult on us.

71
00:03:54,787 --> 00:03:56,755
It's definitely taking its toll.

72
00:03:56,856 --> 00:03:59,586
You know you're free to go. It's not like
you made a commitment to this woman.

73
00:03:59,692 --> 00:04:02,217
Well, I didn't make
a "commitment."

74
00:04:02,328 --> 00:04:05,354
<i>- I did refer to it as our nausea.
- Mm.</i>

75
00:04:05,465 --> 00:04:10,129
But you know, that's when
we were goin' at it really hot and heavy.

76
00:04:10,236 --> 00:04:12,204
<i>Well, now it's my nausea.</i>

77
00:04:12,305 --> 00:04:12,572
<i>Later, Lucille stopped by
the model home...</i>

78
00:04:12,572 --> 00:04:14,904
<i>Later, Lucille stopped by
the model home...</i>

79
00:04:15,008 --> 00:04:18,068
<i>to enlist her daughter's help
cataloging her valuables.</i>

80
00:04:18,177 --> 00:04:19,804
- I can't.
- Why not?

81
00:04:19,912 --> 00:04:23,404
Because I'm... Don't want to.

82
00:04:23,516 --> 00:04:25,541
Maybe I don't feel like being criticized
around-the-clock.

83
00:04:25,652 --> 00:04:29,645
I don't criticize you.
And if you're worried about criticism...

84
00:04:29,756 --> 00:04:33,886
sometimes a diet
is the best defense.

85
00:04:33,993 --> 00:04:35,961
- Oh, hey, Gangy.
- Hi.

86
00:04:36,062 --> 00:04:40,294
- D-plus. Sign this.
- This is a D-minus.

87
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,767
- Either way, it's above a "D," right?
- Another world-beater.

88
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:48,637
<i>And Lindsay realized she needed
to take a firmer hand with her daughter.</i>

89
00:04:48,741 --> 00:04:51,232
- I'm not signing this.
- Fine. I will.

90
00:04:52,545 --> 00:04:54,445
Is "Lindsay"
with an "A" or an "E"?

91
00:04:54,547 --> 00:04:59,211
Okay, I know you got a "crocodile" in spelling,
but this has gone too far.

92
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:01,344
I hate to say it,
but Michael might be right.

93
00:05:01,454 --> 00:05:03,422
You need to learn
a little discipline.

94
00:05:03,523 --> 00:05:05,821
Hmm. Nope, that doesn't feel right.

95
00:05:05,925 --> 00:05:08,826
No, no, no.
I'm telling you.

96
00:05:08,928 --> 00:05:11,761
You are now punished.
I punish thee.

97
00:05:11,864 --> 00:05:13,559
Are you serious?

98
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:15,827
What could you possibly come up with
that would punish me?

99
00:05:15,935 --> 00:05:17,835
Oh, I have to come up
with another thing?

100
00:05:17,937 --> 00:05:23,432
<i>Oh, Lindsay, before I go,
I just have one word for you.</i>

101
00:05:23,543 --> 00:05:26,137
"Sleeves."

102
00:05:26,245 --> 00:05:29,612
You're going to spend the day
working for your grandmother.

103
00:05:31,317 --> 00:05:34,286
No. No, that's not the answer,
because you...

104
00:05:34,387 --> 00:05:37,288
<i>What? No! You stupidjerk!
Why don't...</i>

105
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:40,291
Dumb. Dumb.
Dumb, George Michael.

106
00:05:40,393 --> 00:05:42,361
<i>- Dumb, dumb.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

107
00:05:42,462 --> 00:05:45,158
Calm down, you two.
It's just a math problem.

108
00:05:45,264 --> 00:05:47,494
If I fail math,
there goes my chance at a good job...

109
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,467
and a happy life full of hard work,
like you always say.

110
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:54,472
Maybe I'm pushing you too hard.

111
00:05:54,574 --> 00:05:56,667
You're all stressed-out.
Your eyes are all red.

112
00:05:56,776 --> 00:05:59,142
Why don't you take the night off.
just shut the book.

113
00:05:59,245 --> 00:06:03,147
Go ahead.
just close the book.

114
00:06:05,284 --> 00:06:07,684
Go ahead.

115
00:06:09,689 --> 00:06:11,816
Your finger is still in the book.

116
00:06:13,993 --> 00:06:15,756
George Michael.

117
00:06:24,537 --> 00:06:27,802
<i>Buster, meanwhile,
was still worried about Lucille 2...</i>

118
00:06:27,907 --> 00:06:29,807
<i>whose condition
seemed to be worsening.</i>

119
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:32,434
You okay?
How's your nausea?

120
00:06:32,545 --> 00:06:34,445
"Our."

121
00:06:34,547 --> 00:06:37,778
<i>I mean, our... our nausea.</i>

122
00:06:37,884 --> 00:06:40,546
<i>He remembered a study
he took part in...</i>

123
00:06:40,653 --> 00:06:44,885
<i>on medical marijuana
and its effects on nausea.</i>

124
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:50,054
<i>The subject took the drug
in the form of a T.H.C. pill.</i>

125
00:06:50,163 --> 00:06:52,927
<i>Nausea was then induced
with a day at the carnival...</i>

126
00:06:53,032 --> 00:06:57,366
<i>which is what attracted Buster
to the experiment in the first place.</i>

127
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,597
<i>Buster was found
two days later...</i>

128
00:06:59,705 --> 00:07:03,197
<i>trying to eat his way
through this enormous plaster donut.</i>

129
00:07:03,309 --> 00:07:08,246
<i>So Buster went to the toughest,
most streetwise kid he knew.</i>

130
00:07:08,347 --> 00:07:11,908
- Tell your friends.
- Hey, Nephew. I was looking
for you at your home.

131
00:07:12,018 --> 00:07:15,044
- Dad told me to take the day off,
so I decided to come into work.
- Oh.

132
00:07:15,154 --> 00:07:18,555
I thought maybe you could
help me get some weed.

133
00:07:18,658 --> 00:07:21,718
It's not for me.
It's for Lucille 2, my girlfriend.

134
00:07:21,828 --> 00:07:25,457
She's your girlfriend?
Dad said you were her nurse.

135
00:07:25,565 --> 00:07:27,533
Look, she's sick.
This could help her.

136
00:07:27,633 --> 00:07:29,533
Pillform would actually be fantastic.

137
00:07:29,635 --> 00:07:31,728
I could put it on a tea biscuit,
tell her it's a marshmallow.

138
00:07:31,838 --> 00:07:35,069
I have no idea where to get something
like that. What makes you think I would?

139
00:07:35,174 --> 00:07:38,109
You work here.
This place is pot central, right?

140
00:07:38,211 --> 00:07:40,372
<i>In the '70s,
the boardwalk was the place...</i>

141
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,313
<i>to buy marijuana
in Newport Beach.</i>

142
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,475
<i>The stand served
as a convenient meeting place...</i>

143
00:07:45,585 --> 00:07:49,851
<i>because of the banana's resemblance
to a yellow marijuana cigarette.</i>

144
00:07:49,956 --> 00:07:54,325
<i>- It had even inspired a song.
-? Big yellowjoint
The big yellowjoint?</i>

145
00:07:54,427 --> 00:07:57,487
<i>? I'll meet you down
at the big yellowjoint?</i>

146
00:07:57,597 --> 00:08:00,964
I'm sorry. I can't help you.
Why don't you just ask Uncle Gob?

147
00:08:01,067 --> 00:08:03,797
Why are you hitting yourself?
Why are you hitting yourself?

148
00:08:03,903 --> 00:08:06,895
No. No.
He'd never do it.

149
00:08:07,006 --> 00:08:09,668
Besides, he always makes fun of me
for dating Lucille.

150
00:08:09,775 --> 00:08:11,766
- Everybody does.
- That's horrible.

151
00:08:11,878 --> 00:08:15,109
You could tell Gob for me,
but you can't tell him it's for me.

152
00:08:15,214 --> 00:08:16,841
- You can't tell anybody.
- I'm working.
- George Michael.

153
00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:20,680
What are you doing here?
I thought I told you to take the day off.

154
00:08:20,786 --> 00:08:23,619
- There's nothing to do. Maeby's at Gangy's.
- Find something to do.

155
00:08:23,723 --> 00:08:25,782
Go make mistakes,
get in trouble... be young.

156
00:08:25,892 --> 00:08:28,622
<i>Yes! I totally agree.
Make a mistake.</i>

157
00:08:28,728 --> 00:08:31,663
Here. Here's 20 bucks.
I want you to close up shop and go crazy.

158
00:08:31,764 --> 00:08:33,664
Go find yourself something
to buy that you don't need.

159
00:08:33,766 --> 00:08:37,532
Absolutely. Here.
Take 225 from me.

160
00:08:39,138 --> 00:08:42,005
<i>? Big yellowjoint
Big yellowjoint?</i>

161
00:08:42,108 --> 00:08:44,167
<i>? I'll meet you down
at the big yellowjoint?</i>

162
00:08:46,948 --> 00:08:50,315
<i>Maeby was working
with her grandmother.</i>

163
00:08:50,418 --> 00:08:55,378
And this is from when your Pop-Pop
yelled out, "Oh, Melanie..."

164
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,981
when he was making love
to Gangy.

165
00:08:58,092 --> 00:09:01,152
This is so much fun. I can't believe my mom
thought being here would be a punishment.

166
00:09:01,262 --> 00:09:04,925
Oh, she thinks I'm too critical.
That's another fault of hers.

167
00:09:05,032 --> 00:09:06,932
Ah, yes.

168
00:09:07,034 --> 00:09:09,867
The week we had the au pair.

169
00:09:09,971 --> 00:09:12,064
You know, your mother
always wanted this brooch.

170
00:09:12,173 --> 00:09:14,835
- Really?
- Do you want it?

171
00:09:14,942 --> 00:09:19,003
I do now. That'll show her
for trying to punish me.

172
00:09:19,113 --> 00:09:23,015
Oh. Pretty.
It'll distract from the freckles.

173
00:09:28,756 --> 00:09:31,054
<i>George Michael nervously
approached the family yacht...</i>

174
00:09:31,158 --> 00:09:33,786
<i>Gob had been staying on.</i>

175
00:09:33,895 --> 00:09:35,954
<i>- Uncle Gob?
- When he saw the yacht was empty...</i>

176
00:09:36,063 --> 00:09:40,727
<i>George Michael... as he'd been trained
to do since childhood... left a note.</i>

177
00:09:41,936 --> 00:09:43,631
<i>Back at the model home...</i>

178
00:09:43,738 --> 00:09:46,639
<i>Gob showed Michael the note
he'd found at the dock.</i>

179
00:09:46,741 --> 00:09:50,905
<i>- No. This can't be from my son.
- It is his handwriting.</i>

180
00:09:51,012 --> 00:09:53,845
Plus he left me $200.

181
00:09:53,948 --> 00:09:56,075
$100.

182
00:09:56,183 --> 00:09:58,913
100. I accidentally said 200.
I don't know...

183
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:02,717
- This is impossible. Why would he do this?
- I know. I was shocked.

184
00:10:02,823 --> 00:10:06,657
Really, a hundred dollars. You can't
get good weed for a hundred bucks.

185
00:10:06,761 --> 00:10:08,752
<i>Anyway, here you go.</i>

186
00:10:08,863 --> 00:10:12,594
Now we are even on you
paying off that Hot Cops thing.

187
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:17,069
- Might just be a few stems...
- Get that out of this house.
What's the matter with you?

188
00:10:17,171 --> 00:10:19,162
Maybe you should
save the lectures for your son...

189
00:10:19,273 --> 00:10:21,241
if he can remember them.

190
00:10:21,342 --> 00:10:24,072
I speak to Lindsay one time about her
hippie parenting, and I end up with a hippie.

191
00:10:24,178 --> 00:10:27,409
- It does seem pretty quick.
- For all I know, this has been goin' on forever.

192
00:10:27,515 --> 00:10:31,576
He's been stressed, his eyes have been red,
his grades are dropping.

193
00:10:31,686 --> 00:10:35,520
- Heard about the A-minus.
- I'm gonna go find out what's going on.

194
00:10:35,623 --> 00:10:38,183
- Hey, what you doin'?
- Nothing.

195
00:10:38,292 --> 00:10:42,729
No? So, listen, your, uh,
your Uncle Gob...

196
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:46,231
seems to think that he saw you
down at the docks today.

197
00:10:46,334 --> 00:10:48,768
- Was that you?
- No, no.

198
00:10:48,869 --> 00:10:52,498
Maybe it was the other George Michael...
the singer-songwriter.

199
00:10:52,607 --> 00:10:54,507
- Yeah, that makes sense.
- Yeah.

200
00:10:54,609 --> 00:10:57,544
What'd you do
with the, um...

201
00:10:57,645 --> 00:11:00,170
with the money Buster and I gave you
to go have fun with?

202
00:11:00,281 --> 00:11:02,841
I put that
in my savings account.

203
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:05,441
- Is that right?
- Yeah. Save up.

204
00:11:05,553 --> 00:11:10,115
<i>- Okay. Thanks for being honest.
- Yeah.</i>

205
00:11:10,224 --> 00:11:12,385
He's lying to me.
Can you believe that?

206
00:11:12,493 --> 00:11:14,461
Where the hell
is this family's morality?

207
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:18,130
I don't know.

208
00:11:18,232 --> 00:11:21,133
- What...
- It's cold out here.

209
00:11:21,235 --> 00:11:23,601
What do I do now? If I confront him,
he's gonna lie to me again.

210
00:11:23,704 --> 00:11:28,334
- Should I yell at him?
- Didn't Dad teach us that
we don't yell in this family?

211
00:11:28,442 --> 00:11:32,208
Tell me before you hit the gas.

212
00:11:32,313 --> 00:11:34,213
I can't hear you!

213
00:11:34,315 --> 00:11:36,146
The kids are yelling.

214
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:39,686
Tell me before you hit the gas.

215
00:11:39,787 --> 00:11:44,349
I guess you're saying,
"Hit the gas."

216
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,016
Don't! Wait! No!

217
00:11:52,099 --> 00:11:57,435
That's why you don't yell.

218
00:11:57,538 --> 00:12:00,006
Yeah, yelling's
not a good way to go.

219
00:12:00,107 --> 00:12:02,075
I got a better idea.

220
00:12:02,176 --> 00:12:04,406
You wanna teach
George Michael a lesson?

221
00:12:04,545 --> 00:12:08,276
Yes, I do, and it's gotta stick. He's getting
into drugs, Dad, and he's lying to me.

222
00:12:08,382 --> 00:12:10,407
That doesn't sound
like the boy.

223
00:12:10,518 --> 00:12:12,418
It's my fault.
I've been pushing him too hard.

224
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,420
- It's just... Dumb, dumb. Dumb, Michael.
- Hey, hey.

225
00:12:14,522 --> 00:12:16,217
- Dumb.
- Shh, shh, shh. I forgive you.

226
00:12:16,323 --> 00:12:19,850
I don't want your forgiveness. I want the guy
with the one arm and the fake blood.

227
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,690
- J. Walter Weatherman...
how do I get ahold of him?
- He's, uh, dead.

228
00:12:22,797 --> 00:12:25,891
You killed him when you left the door open
with the air conditioner running.

229
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,697
For God's sake. He's not dead.
I need to do this soon, tonight.

230
00:12:29,804 --> 00:12:32,568
Down by the docks... I'm gonna make it
like a drug deal went bad.

231
00:12:32,673 --> 00:12:37,201
Tonight? No. It's Yontif.
It's the first night of Yom Kippur.

232
00:12:37,311 --> 00:12:39,802
Dad, that's just... That's one night,
and it's back in September.

233
00:12:39,914 --> 00:12:41,814
That's okay.
You've only been a Jew about two days.

234
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:45,374
- Just try to talk to him.
- Like you talked to me when I was growing up?

235
00:12:45,486 --> 00:12:48,614
- I thought you hated those lessons.
- I did, but they worked.

236
00:12:48,723 --> 00:12:52,659
- And they will work again.
- Well, I'm done with them,
because it was wrong, Michael.

237
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,285
- Come on.
- Your son is a timid, thoughtful boy.

238
00:12:55,396 --> 00:12:58,991
He's a scholar, like his grandfather.

239
00:13:00,768 --> 00:13:03,566
What time is it?
Oh, almost sundown.

240
00:13:03,671 --> 00:13:05,571
I have to prepare for the Sabbath.

241
00:13:05,673 --> 00:13:08,972
- It's Tuesday.
- Shh, shh, shh.

242
00:13:09,076 --> 00:13:12,637
<i>Lindsay went to see
how her own attempt at parental
discipline was coming along.</i>

243
00:13:12,747 --> 00:13:14,908
So, having fun?

244
00:13:15,015 --> 00:13:19,349
- Where'd you get that brooch?
- Gangy. Nice, huh?

245
00:13:19,453 --> 00:13:22,251
<i>That was supposed to be for me.
She was my au pair.</i>

246
00:13:22,356 --> 00:13:25,120
I'm the one who cleared my throat
and pointed to the laundry room.

247
00:13:25,226 --> 00:13:28,252
<i>Ma! You know I wanted that.</i>

248
00:13:28,362 --> 00:13:30,262
I know, but it's an elephant...

249
00:13:30,364 --> 00:13:32,832
and I didn't want
to invite the comparison.

250
00:13:32,933 --> 00:13:35,026
Nice.

251
00:13:35,136 --> 00:13:37,434
In any event, your punishment is over.
Come on. Let's go.

252
00:13:37,538 --> 00:13:40,803
She's not going anywhere.
We're having fun.

253
00:13:40,908 --> 00:13:44,207
<i>- Here, Maeby. Try this on.
- I see.</i>

254
00:13:44,311 --> 00:13:47,041
Fine. I was gonna
take her out for ice cream...

255
00:13:47,148 --> 00:13:51,881
<i>but if you'd rather stay here,
well, that's just fine with me.</i>

256
00:13:56,557 --> 00:13:58,684
We could go get
some ice cream, Gangy.

257
00:13:58,793 --> 00:14:01,523
- That would be fun, right?
- I don't think so.

258
00:14:01,629 --> 00:14:03,529
That chubby little wrist
of yours...

259
00:14:03,631 --> 00:14:07,158
is testing the tensile strength
of this bracelet as it is.

260
00:14:07,268 --> 00:14:10,829
<i>Maeby decided that perhaps
she'd had enough ofher grandmother.</i>

261
00:14:10,938 --> 00:14:14,305
<i>Maeby. Maeby?</i>

262
00:14:18,579 --> 00:14:21,776
Hey, Gob. It's Michael. I figured out a way
for you to repay that favor.

263
00:14:21,882 --> 00:14:23,782
Dad wouldn't help me
teach George Michael the lesson...

264
00:14:23,884 --> 00:14:26,284
so I need your help
and your Hot Cop friends.

265
00:14:26,387 --> 00:14:30,721
- I wanna fake a drug bust.
- Michael, these guys are real dancers.

266
00:14:30,825 --> 00:14:34,192
<i>They've never done
any hot policing.</i>

267
00:14:34,295 --> 00:14:37,458
They don't even need to be hot. They just
need to show up in those uniforms.

268
00:14:37,565 --> 00:14:40,227
<i>And so, Michael's plan
was put into motion.</i>

269
00:14:40,334 --> 00:14:43,030
- Where have you been?
- What?

270
00:14:43,137 --> 00:14:45,605
I am like a caged animal.

271
00:14:48,943 --> 00:14:51,173
My old lady's on the floor, man.

272
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:53,576
I am not s-ing around.

273
00:14:53,681 --> 00:14:56,377
Yeah. Gob just called.
He's got the stuff at the yacht.

274
00:14:56,483 --> 00:14:59,213
- Oh, great. Let's go.
- No. I think my dad's onto this.

275
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,515
- I'm out. I'm not...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on.

276
00:15:01,622 --> 00:15:04,216
Gob will never give it to me.

277
00:15:04,325 --> 00:15:08,193
My woman is sick. Please?

278
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:17,301
<i>Later that night, Michael
made the final arrangements with Gob.</i>

279
00:15:17,403 --> 00:15:19,871
All right, Gob, is this
gonna be believable?

280
00:15:19,973 --> 00:15:21,941
I want him scared.
I love this kid.

281
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:23,838
These guys are pros.
They're gonna push the tension...

282
00:15:23,943 --> 00:15:25,774
to the last possible moment
before they strip.

283
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:28,712
They're not going to strip,
are they?

284
00:15:28,815 --> 00:15:31,477
I told them not to, but I can't promise
that their instincts won't kick in.

285
00:15:31,584 --> 00:15:34,109
- Unbelievable.
- Trust me. It's gonna be totally real.

286
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,552
This kind of thing goes on
all the time out here.

287
00:15:36,656 --> 00:15:39,216
Boats wait offshore,
lights are flashed.

288
00:15:39,325 --> 00:15:41,691
A guy comes over
and drops off a bag.

289
00:15:41,795 --> 00:15:43,763
It's gonna freak
the little bastard out.

290
00:15:43,863 --> 00:15:45,797
<i>Michael went off to hide...</i>

291
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:48,868
<i>while Buster and George Michael
arrived as planned.</i>

292
00:15:48,968 --> 00:15:50,936
I really appreciate
you doing this for me.

293
00:15:51,037 --> 00:15:54,473
You're making a very
miserable person happy.

294
00:15:54,574 --> 00:15:56,474
She really feels awful, huh?

295
00:15:56,576 --> 00:15:58,635
Oh. Oh, I was talking
about me.

296
00:15:58,745 --> 00:16:01,145
But, yeah, she's a mess.
Be careful.

297
00:16:09,789 --> 00:16:12,883
- Uncle Gob?
- George Michael.

298
00:16:12,992 --> 00:16:16,689
- You weren't followed, were you?
- No, I don't think so.

299
00:16:16,796 --> 00:16:19,560
All right, kid.

300
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:21,634
Let's deal some drugs.

301
00:16:25,071 --> 00:16:27,665
What are you doin'?

302
00:16:27,774 --> 00:16:32,143
Flashing the lights...
so the dealer knows what's goin' down.

303
00:16:36,149 --> 00:16:39,414
- Now we wait.
- How long?

304
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,612
Who knows?
An hour.

305
00:16:41,721 --> 00:16:44,485
<i>- Maybe five.
- Drug delivery!</i>

306
00:16:44,591 --> 00:16:46,684
You wanted some marijuana?

307
00:16:46,793 --> 00:16:48,727
No, not me.
My nephew did.

308
00:16:48,828 --> 00:16:51,456
Show me the money.

309
00:16:56,202 --> 00:16:59,638
- Show us the pot.
- I got it right here.

310
00:16:59,739 --> 00:17:02,731
- Oh, my God.
- Nice, right?

311
00:17:02,842 --> 00:17:05,640
Okay, you can put your shirt down, Derek.
just give him the stuff.

312
00:17:11,551 --> 00:17:15,146
So. We have a deal.

313
00:17:15,255 --> 00:17:17,155
We have a deal.

314
00:17:17,257 --> 00:17:19,157
<i>He's ruining his life!</i>

315
00:17:19,259 --> 00:17:22,990
<i>- Police officers! Freeze!
- What? Oh, no! It's the cops!</i>

316
00:17:23,096 --> 00:17:26,224
- And a construction worker.
- Let's get this party started.

317
00:17:26,332 --> 00:17:29,324
- Aren't you guys gonna cuff him?
- You wanted handcuffs?

318
00:17:29,435 --> 00:17:34,168
<i>All right. George Michael,
I hope you learned your lesson, pal.</i>

319
00:17:36,276 --> 00:17:39,734
Okay.

320
00:17:39,846 --> 00:17:43,179
Okay, all right. Thank you. Thank you.

321
00:17:43,283 --> 00:17:45,183
- What is this?
- This is a lesson.

322
00:17:45,285 --> 00:17:48,049
Maybe I pushed you
into this, but...

323
00:17:48,154 --> 00:17:50,588
I love you too much to see you
ruin your life with that crap.

324
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:53,784
- But it wasn't for me.
- Then who was it for?

325
00:17:53,893 --> 00:17:55,861
Who? Give me a name.

326
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:00,163
- Okay, it was for me.
- Yeah.

327
00:18:00,266 --> 00:18:02,291
I was gonna smoke the marijuana
like a cigarette.

328
00:18:02,435 --> 00:18:05,336
Now you're looking at a nice big, fat punishment.

329
00:18:05,438 --> 00:18:08,874
I'm sorry. Excuse me.
I'm sorry. Ooh! Uh...

330
00:18:08,975 --> 00:18:14,140
- What are you doing here?
- The, uh... The boy was lookin' out for me.

331
00:18:14,247 --> 00:18:18,377
- What?
- It-It's for my girlfriend. She's sick.

332
00:18:18,484 --> 00:18:21,044
Why don't you just wait it out?
She's gonna be gone soon.

333
00:18:21,154 --> 00:18:23,714
- Oh, that's it.
- Hey!

334
00:18:23,823 --> 00:18:25,882
Why are you hitting yourself?
Why are you hitting yourself?

335
00:18:25,992 --> 00:18:29,052
- Why are you hitting yourself?
Why are you hitting yourself?
- Hey! Buster!

336
00:18:29,162 --> 00:18:31,790
What's the matter with you?
Easy.

337
00:18:31,898 --> 00:18:33,923
Is that true?
Why didn't you tell me this?

338
00:18:34,033 --> 00:18:37,059
You're always telling me
to do the right thing... put family first.

339
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:41,004
You know, it is unbelievable
that you'd ask my son to score you pot.

340
00:18:41,107 --> 00:18:43,541
Why don't you drive him home,
and you and I will talk about this later.

341
00:18:43,643 --> 00:18:46,009
- Go ahead. Go with Buster.
- I'm sorry.

342
00:18:46,112 --> 00:18:50,139
<i>- Hey, what are you guys doin'?
- We got your signal. You flashed the lights.</i>

343
00:18:50,249 --> 00:18:52,513
We got the drugs.
You got the money?

344
00:18:52,618 --> 00:18:55,178
No, no. No, no, no, no.
We're all good.

345
00:18:55,288 --> 00:18:57,756
We just want the money,
You wanna make this ugly?

346
00:18:57,857 --> 00:19:00,758
We were just teaching the young fellow
a lesson. We don't want any trouble with you.

347
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:03,420
- Thanks very much.
- Do you know who you're dealin' with?

348
00:19:03,529 --> 00:19:06,965
Drop the boxes! Put your hands in the air.

349
00:19:07,066 --> 00:19:09,364
- What is this?
- We had nothin' to do with this!

350
00:19:09,469 --> 00:19:12,666
- You set us up!
- No, no! These are just strippers!

351
00:19:12,772 --> 00:19:15,434
- Look how hot they are!
- Everybody take a breath!

352
00:19:25,485 --> 00:19:28,420
<i>Oh, my God! My arm!</i>

353
00:19:28,521 --> 00:19:30,421
Oh, my God!
This guy's arm...

354
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:36,358
just came off
and landed on the dock.

355
00:19:36,462 --> 00:19:39,056
<i>Michael realized
that his father had, once again...</i>

356
00:19:39,165 --> 00:19:41,224
<i>taught him an elaborate lesson.</i>

357
00:19:41,334 --> 00:19:45,327
And that's why you don't
teach lessons to your son.

358
00:19:45,438 --> 00:19:48,032
<i>How could you do that to me?</i>

359
00:19:48,141 --> 00:19:51,838
I told you he's a good kid. You should try
talking to him when you think he's in trouble.

360
00:19:51,944 --> 00:19:55,744
Don't make the same mistake I did,
you know... teaching lessons.

361
00:19:55,848 --> 00:19:57,748
So you taught me a lesson
not to teach lessons?

362
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:00,944
It was my last lesson.

363
00:20:02,588 --> 00:20:06,490
<i>- Back home.
- Back from your wonderful time with Gangy?</i>

364
00:20:06,592 --> 00:20:10,323
Well, actually, it wasn't so wonderful.
She can be kinda nasty.

365
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:12,830
But I'll tell you somethin'.

366
00:20:12,932 --> 00:20:16,231
I'm glad you're my mom.

367
00:20:16,335 --> 00:20:19,327
Oh, um,
I got you something.

368
00:20:19,439 --> 00:20:21,999
- You're giving me this?
- You deserve it.

369
00:20:22,108 --> 00:20:24,269
I can't believe you had
to put up with her your whole life.

370
00:20:25,778 --> 00:20:30,681
Honey, this is so sweet.

371
00:20:30,783 --> 00:20:32,774
Let's celebrate and go shopping.

372
00:20:32,885 --> 00:20:36,412
- You knew the whole time, didn't you?
- Kind of.

373
00:20:36,522 --> 00:20:38,854
One of the Hot Cops
is my choir teacher.

374
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:41,893
I'm sorry about all this.
It's just you were so stressed out...

375
00:20:41,994 --> 00:20:45,452
and I guess I got scared and...

376
00:20:45,565 --> 00:20:47,931
I should learn to talk with you
a little bit more, huh?

377
00:20:48,034 --> 00:20:50,628
- I think we're okay.
- We are, aren't we?

378
00:20:50,736 --> 00:20:53,227
You know there's nothing you can't
be totally honest with me about.

379
00:20:53,339 --> 00:20:56,308
You can say anything to me,
anything at all.

380
00:20:56,409 --> 00:20:59,867
Like, say, I had a crush
on my own cousin.

381
00:21:04,984 --> 00:21:07,043
Hey.

382
00:21:07,153 --> 00:21:10,316
<i>- You just taught me a lesson.
- Oh.</i>

383
00:21:10,423 --> 00:21:12,789
<i>-? Big yellowjoint
The big yellowjoint?
- All right. We're even.</i>

384
00:21:12,892 --> 00:21:16,453
<i>? I'll meet you down
at the big yellowjoint?</i>

385
00:21:17,892 --> 00:21:59,453
