1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,115
<i>This is Michael Bluth.</i>

2
00:00:07,223 --> 00:00:09,214
<i>For 10 years, he's worked
for his father's company...</i>

3
00:00:09,325 --> 00:00:11,316
<i>waiting to be made a partner.</i>

4
00:00:11,427 --> 00:00:14,225
<i>And right now, he's happy.</i>

5
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:17,060
<i>- This is Michael's mother.
- Look what they've done, Michael.</i>

6
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:18,758
<i>She isn't happy.</i>

7
00:00:18,868 --> 00:00:21,462
Look what the homosexuals
have done to me.

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,004
You can't just comb that out
and reset it?

9
00:00:24,106 --> 00:00:27,405
<i>Currently, she's upset that her
husband's retirement party...</i>

10
00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:30,307
<i>is being upstaged by a group
of gay protesters.</i>

11
00:00:30,412 --> 00:00:33,438
We're here! We're queer!
We want to get married on the ocean!

12
00:00:33,549 --> 00:00:36,950
Everything they do
is so dramatic and flamboyant.

13
00:00:37,052 --> 00:00:40,818
It just makes me
want to set myself on fire.

14
00:00:40,923 --> 00:00:43,414
Good grief, Mother.

15
00:00:43,525 --> 00:00:46,153
Not all homosexuals
are flamboy...

16
00:00:46,262 --> 00:00:48,287
Oh, my God! I have
the exact same blouse.

17
00:00:48,397 --> 00:00:50,661
<i>This is Michael's twin sister, Lindsay.</i>

18
00:00:50,766 --> 00:00:52,666
I like it better on him.

19
00:00:52,768 --> 00:00:55,362
<i>As a youthful act of defiance,
Lindsay married...</i>

20
00:00:55,471 --> 00:00:57,371
<i>this man.</i>

21
00:00:57,473 --> 00:00:59,998
<i>They moved to Boston,
where they've become celebrated...</i>

22
00:01:00,109 --> 00:01:02,577
<i>for their wine and cheese
fund-raisers.</i>

23
00:01:02,678 --> 00:01:04,873
Oh, no.
I'm completely stuffed.

24
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,448
<i>Michael and his sister
haven't spoken in a year.</i>

25
00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:09,608
<i>Neither has acknowledged this.</i>

26
00:01:09,718 --> 00:01:12,152
<i>And this is Gob,
Michael's oldest brother.</i>

27
00:01:12,254 --> 00:01:15,223
<i>So, this is the magic trick, huh?</i>

28
00:01:15,324 --> 00:01:19,158
Illusion, Michael. A trick is something
a whore does for money.

29
00:01:22,765 --> 00:01:24,699
Or candy.

30
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,463
<i>Gob recently started
the Alliance of Magicians...</i>

31
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,538
<i>an organization that blackballs
any performer...</i>

32
00:01:30,639 --> 00:01:32,903
<i>who reveals a magician's secret.</i>

33
00:01:33,008 --> 00:01:35,101
<i>And finally there's Buster...</i>

34
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:38,441
<i>- Hey, Buster.
- the youngest of Michael's siblings.</i>

35
00:01:38,547 --> 00:01:41,710
You know, you don't need
to do that, buddy. It's okay.

36
00:01:41,817 --> 00:01:44,377
<i>Thanks to the family's largesse,
Buster has studied everything...</i>

37
00:01:44,486 --> 00:01:47,182
<i>from Native American
tribal ceremonies...</i>

38
00:01:49,258 --> 00:01:52,716
<i>to cartography, the mapping
of uncharted territories.</i>

39
00:01:52,828 --> 00:01:55,854
Hasn't everything already
sort of been discovered, though...

40
00:01:55,965 --> 00:01:58,798
by, like, Magellan and Cortés?

41
00:01:58,901 --> 00:02:00,801
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- All those folks.

42
00:02:00,903 --> 00:02:02,803
Those guys did a pretty good job...

43
00:02:02,905 --> 00:02:06,204
but there's still, you know...

44
00:02:06,308 --> 00:02:09,607
<i>He also suffers
from crippling panic attacks.</i>

45
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:12,237
<i>Yes, this is his family.</i>

46
00:02:12,348 --> 00:02:14,407
<i>So why is Michael so happy?</i>

47
00:02:14,516 --> 00:02:17,917
<i>Because he's decided to never
speak to these people again.</i>

48
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,405
<i>Michael was feeling more
generous about his family...</i>

49
00:02:27,507 --> 00:02:29,771
<i>on the morning of the boat party.</i>

50
00:02:29,876 --> 00:02:34,438
What comes before anything? What have we
always said is the most important thing?

51
00:02:34,547 --> 00:02:38,074
- Breakfast.
- Family.

52
00:02:38,184 --> 00:02:41,585
Family. Right. I thought
you meant of the things you eat.

53
00:02:41,687 --> 00:02:44,588
<i>This is Michael's son, George Michael.</i>

54
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:47,318
I mean, we have made nothing
but sacrifices for this family...

55
00:02:47,426 --> 00:02:49,257
<i>and tonight
it all pays off, my boy.</i>

56
00:02:49,362 --> 00:02:52,297
Tonight your granddad
makes me partner.

57
00:02:52,398 --> 00:02:54,798
<i>To prove his dedication
to the family business...</i>

58
00:02:54,901 --> 00:02:57,961
<i>Michael has decided to live here...
in the model unit...</i>

59
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:00,004
<i>ofhis father's latest housing tract.</i>

60
00:03:00,106 --> 00:03:03,098
<i>The guys live in the attic
so that the house...</i>

61
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:05,473
<i>can still function
as a pristine selling tool.</i>

62
00:03:05,578 --> 00:03:07,512
<i>And when I do get that promotion...</i>

63
00:03:07,613 --> 00:03:09,911
I'll finally be able
to get you what you deserve.

64
00:03:10,016 --> 00:03:12,177
Like a real home.

65
00:03:12,285 --> 00:03:14,583
This is a real home.

66
00:03:14,687 --> 00:03:17,019
No, it's not.
It's a fake home, son.

67
00:03:17,123 --> 00:03:19,023
You want the loops
or the flakes today?

68
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,355
<i>The guys then
headed down to Balboa Island...</i>

69
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,860
<i>so George Michael could work
at the frozen banana stand...</i>

70
00:03:23,963 --> 00:03:25,988
<i>his grandfather started in 1953.</i>

71
00:03:26,098 --> 00:03:27,656
Bananas.

72
00:03:27,767 --> 00:03:31,100
<i>Michael, meanwhile,
was meeting his brother Gob...</i>

73
00:03:31,203 --> 00:03:33,262
<i>hoping to discuss
his father's boat party.</i>

74
00:03:33,372 --> 00:03:36,102
<i>Do you have your check
for your share of the party?</i>

75
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,676
You know, I sort of thought
my contribution...

76
00:03:38,778 --> 00:03:40,678
could be a magic show.

77
00:03:42,248 --> 00:03:44,546
- Oh, that's perfect, Gob.
- Thank you.

78
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:47,949
I just remembered something.
Dad's retiring, not turning six.

79
00:03:48,054 --> 00:03:51,956
Hey, come on! I just bought this new
illusion called the Aztec Tomb.

80
00:03:52,058 --> 00:03:55,186
- It cost like 18 grand! I'm gonna do it on the boat.
- I don't care.

81
00:03:55,294 --> 00:03:58,388
What do you care? Can't you just charge
the party to the company?

82
00:03:58,497 --> 00:04:01,591
- It's not a business expense.
- So what? Lindsay's been staying
at the Four Seasons for a month.

83
00:04:01,701 --> 00:04:03,999
She's probably charging the company.

84
00:04:04,103 --> 00:04:06,628
Lindsay's been in town for a month?

85
00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:09,674
I don't think so.

86
00:04:09,775 --> 00:04:12,243
<i>Michael was upset to hear this...</i>

87
00:04:12,345 --> 00:04:14,609
<i>so he went to discuss it with his mother.</i>

88
00:04:14,714 --> 00:04:18,241
Mom! Mother! Give me your
company checkbook. You're cut off.

89
00:04:18,351 --> 00:04:21,184
Michael, look.
Look what happened to my fox.

90
00:04:21,287 --> 00:04:23,915
Someone cut off his little foot.

91
00:04:24,023 --> 00:04:27,015
Is it... Is it noticeable?

92
00:04:27,126 --> 00:04:29,560
You've gotta remember...
you're gonna be all splattered in red paint.

93
00:04:29,662 --> 00:04:31,562
That's gonna distract the eye.

94
00:04:31,664 --> 00:04:35,191
I don't want you charging any more
of your personal expenses to the company.

95
00:04:35,301 --> 00:04:39,067
Well, I had to pay for the Aztec Tomb.
Gob says it's a career maker.

96
00:04:39,171 --> 00:04:42,572
Wait a minute. The company
paid for the Aztec Tomb? That's great.

97
00:04:42,675 --> 00:04:44,802
Well, I was talking about Lindsay, okay?

98
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:49,404
You put her in a five-star hotel, on top
of which you didn't tell me she was in town.

99
00:04:49,515 --> 00:04:53,417
<i>If you're saying I play favorites, you're
wrong. I love all my children equally.</i>

100
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:55,953
I don't care for Gob.

101
00:04:58,057 --> 00:05:01,515
Good grief. I dipped into
the kitty a couple of times.

102
00:05:01,627 --> 00:05:03,754
You should be focused on tonight.

103
00:05:03,863 --> 00:05:06,457
Dad's making a big announcement.

104
00:05:06,565 --> 00:05:10,262
Yeah? I knew it.
It's about me, isn't it?

105
00:05:11,871 --> 00:05:15,034
I wonder how I can talk you
out of ever making that face again.

106
00:05:15,141 --> 00:05:17,041
<i>Michael!</i>

107
00:05:17,143 --> 00:05:19,043
<i>Tobias.</i>

108
00:05:19,145 --> 00:05:22,239
How are you?

109
00:05:22,348 --> 00:05:25,806
Good, good.
How's your job search comin'?

110
00:05:27,987 --> 00:05:30,478
- It's good. It's going to be good.
- Yeah? Great.

111
00:05:30,589 --> 00:05:33,319
I'm hoping the universe
provides a path for me.

112
00:05:33,426 --> 00:05:35,894
<i>Tobias recently lost his medical license...</i>

113
00:05:35,995 --> 00:05:38,930
<i>for administering C.P.R.
to a person who, as it turned out...</i>

114
00:05:39,031 --> 00:05:42,262
<i>was not having a heart attack.</i>

115
00:05:42,368 --> 00:05:46,805
Maybe you'll be inspired by the boat party
tonight, start a career as a pirate.

116
00:05:46,906 --> 00:05:49,466
I haven't packed for that.

117
00:05:49,575 --> 00:05:51,805
<i>- Couldn't find a thing.
- Lindsay!</i>

118
00:05:51,911 --> 00:05:54,812
- Michael!
- How was your flight?

119
00:05:54,914 --> 00:05:57,678
- Great. Great. We just got in.
- He knows.

120
00:05:57,783 --> 00:06:00,809
A month ago. Oh, I'm sorry.
I've been meaning to call you.

121
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,444
- I really have.
- Really?

122
00:06:02,555 --> 00:06:05,752
- It's just been very busy.
- Ugh! It's been crazy.

123
00:06:05,858 --> 00:06:08,656
We just had an amazing
fund-raiser for HOOP.

124
00:06:08,761 --> 00:06:11,753
- HOOP?
- My anti-circumcision movement.

125
00:06:11,864 --> 00:06:13,832
I think it looks frightening
when it's cut off.

126
00:06:13,933 --> 00:06:15,833
It's a Doberman.
Let it have its ears.

127
00:06:15,935 --> 00:06:17,493
- Hmm.
- Believe it or not...

128
00:06:17,603 --> 00:06:20,470
we brought in over $40,000.

129
00:06:20,573 --> 00:06:23,838
Unbelievable. Sounds like you saved
enough skin to make 10 new boys.

130
00:06:23,943 --> 00:06:26,878
<i>Well, most of that money
was from the Bluth Company.</i>

131
00:06:26,979 --> 00:06:29,140
<i>I mean, how...</i>

132
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,949
are you?

133
00:06:33,052 --> 00:06:34,952
Still good. You know what?

134
00:06:35,054 --> 00:06:37,614
You guys have had your hands
in the company coffer for years.

135
00:06:37,723 --> 00:06:41,056
But starting tomorrow, there is
going to be a new boss in town...

136
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,357
and you're all gonna have to
start fending for yourselves.

137
00:06:44,463 --> 00:06:48,024
<i>You're all gonna finally feel
that sweet sting of sweat in your eyes.</i>

138
00:06:48,134 --> 00:06:50,159
As... Buster!

139
00:06:50,269 --> 00:06:54,069
<i>You can't do that
on the balcony, buddy?</i>

140
00:06:54,173 --> 00:06:56,641
Mom says it's too windy.

141
00:06:59,678 --> 00:07:02,010
<i>Who could've done this?</i>

142
00:07:02,114 --> 00:07:04,480
<i>While Michael
was getting fed up with his family...</i>

143
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:07,677
<i>George Michael was finally
getting to know them.</i>

144
00:07:07,787 --> 00:07:10,847
Um, yeah. I bought
a frozen banana...

145
00:07:10,956 --> 00:07:14,016
and when I bit into it,
I found this.

146
00:07:14,126 --> 00:07:17,584
- Looks like a foot.
- It tasted like a foot.

147
00:07:17,696 --> 00:07:21,530
Which I didn't really mind,
but I'm pretty sure I said no nuts.

148
00:07:21,634 --> 00:07:23,659
Hey, you're my cousin,
aren't you?

149
00:07:23,769 --> 00:07:25,498
Maybe.

150
00:07:25,604 --> 00:07:29,267
<i>This is George Michael's cousin, Maeby.</i>

151
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:32,071
- I can't believe you didn't recognize me.
- We never see you.

152
00:07:32,178 --> 00:07:34,271
We never see anybody in our family.

153
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:37,611
I know. It's our parents' faults.
We should teach them a lesson.

154
00:07:37,716 --> 00:07:42,176
Yeah. No. I don't think so.

155
00:07:42,288 --> 00:07:44,188
I should go
to my mom tonight...

156
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:46,622
and be like,
"I met the cutest guy."

157
00:07:46,725 --> 00:07:50,718
And then she'll see you
and me totally making out.

158
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:53,196
But... But not really, right?

159
00:07:53,299 --> 00:07:55,199
It's perfect.
She'd freak out...

160
00:07:55,301 --> 00:07:57,963
and I'd be like, "If we saw
each other more often, this wouldn't happen."

161
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,698
- But we're cousins.
- That's what makes it funny.

162
00:08:00,806 --> 00:08:04,708
- But isn't it against the law?
- Come on, George Michael.

163
00:08:08,314 --> 00:08:12,273
<i>Tobias, now believing
the boat party to be pirate-themed...</i>

164
00:08:12,384 --> 00:08:15,751
<i>- You look like a pirate!
- began searching through his
wife's luggage for an outfit.</i>

165
00:08:15,855 --> 00:08:18,380
<i>I should say so!
Look at the blouse, sir!</i>

166
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:22,893
<i>Then, mistaking a group
of garishly dressed men for pirates...</i>

167
00:08:22,995 --> 00:08:26,294
<i>Tobias boarded a van
full ofhomosexuals.</i>

168
00:08:26,398 --> 00:08:31,734
<i>Soon he was unwittingly part
of a protest against the local yacht club.</i>

169
00:08:31,837 --> 00:08:33,737
How are you?

170
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,603
Oh, my God! I have
the exact same blouse.

171
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:39,143
I like it better on him.

172
00:08:39,245 --> 00:08:42,237
<i>And Michael's big moment finally came.</i>

173
00:08:42,348 --> 00:08:46,079
I give you the new C.E.O.
for the Bluth Company.

174
00:08:47,253 --> 00:08:49,778
<i>Certainly the smartest Bluth.</i>

175
00:08:49,889 --> 00:08:51,914
My favorite Bluth.

176
00:08:52,024 --> 00:08:57,485
<i>And the, uh, sexiest creature
I have ever laid eyes on.</i>

177
00:08:59,131 --> 00:09:01,998
My lovely wife, Lucille.

178
00:09:05,804 --> 00:09:09,433
Mom!

179
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:12,476
<i>Mom, congratulations!</i>

180
00:09:13,913 --> 00:09:16,279
Sorry. It's not the right time.

181
00:09:26,189 --> 00:09:29,852
<i>I'm not gonna lie to you, Michael.
This is great news for HOOP.</i>

182
00:09:45,808 --> 00:09:47,639
Hey.

183
00:09:47,744 --> 00:09:50,770
- You okay?
- You and I, we've waited long enough.

184
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,407
It's time to move on.
All right?

185
00:09:55,952 --> 00:09:58,648
I guess we're gonna see
you guys even less now.

186
00:09:58,755 --> 00:10:01,053
I told you. We should've
taught them a lesson.

187
00:10:01,157 --> 00:10:03,455
<i>Lindsay, I want you
in this picture. Come on.</i>

188
00:10:09,065 --> 00:10:11,124
<i>All right. Let's see
some smiles, people.</i>

189
00:10:11,234 --> 00:10:15,227
It's a... It's a party,
not a shareholders' meeting.

190
00:10:15,338 --> 00:10:19,536
Are those police boats?

191
00:10:19,642 --> 00:10:22,133
No, I'm serious.
I think they are police boats.

192
00:10:22,245 --> 00:10:25,043
Prepare to be
boarded. Prepare to be boarded.

193
00:10:25,148 --> 00:10:29,244
- I knew it was against the law.
- That's the Securities
and Exchange Commission.

194
00:10:29,352 --> 00:10:31,411
- They have boats?
- Give me a cell phone.

195
00:10:31,521 --> 00:10:35,082
Lindsay, Buster, up to the bridge!
Come on, Buster!

196
00:10:35,191 --> 00:10:38,160
- Almighty good grief.
- Delores, listen to me.

197
00:10:38,261 --> 00:10:40,161
- Out of my way!
- Empty the account.

198
00:10:40,263 --> 00:10:42,823
- Out of my way!
- Why are you crying? Why are you crying?

199
00:10:42,932 --> 00:10:45,366
<i>Out of my way!
Out! Out! Out!</i>

200
00:10:45,468 --> 00:10:48,528
Lindsay, take the wheel!
Buster, find us a channel to the ocean!

201
00:10:48,638 --> 00:10:50,435
Gee, I don't have any
mapping equipment with me.

202
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:54,306
You've had $80,000 worth of cartography
lessons. Get us a channel to the ocean!

203
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:56,708
Okay. Okay. Okay.

204
00:10:56,813 --> 00:11:00,078
- Can you hear me now?
- Obviously this blue part here is the land.

205
00:11:00,183 --> 00:11:02,879
That would mean...

206
00:11:02,985 --> 00:11:05,385
Oh, Buster, Buster.
You'll be all right.

207
00:11:05,488 --> 00:11:08,082
Shredder. No. Save it.
Save it. Shredder.

208
00:11:08,191 --> 00:11:11,251
Please don't leave us now,
Buster! Please!

209
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,158
- Get in the tomb. The Aztec Tomb.
- Save it. Shred it.

210
00:11:14,263 --> 00:11:16,424
Hold on. I don't have time
for your magic tricks.

211
00:11:16,532 --> 00:11:19,399
Illusions, Dad! You don't
have time for my illusions!

212
00:11:19,502 --> 00:11:21,868
What is wrong with you?
Why are you so angry?

213
00:11:21,971 --> 00:11:24,633
Look. Just stay in the box.
I'll make you disappear.

214
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:28,039
<i>The Bluth family
dominated the news that night.</i>

215
00:11:28,144 --> 00:11:30,908
Bluth Development Company
president George Bluth...

216
00:11:31,013 --> 00:11:34,210
was arrested tonight
for defrauding investors...

217
00:11:34,317 --> 00:11:37,718
<i>and using the company
as his personal piggy bank.</i>

218
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,913
More intrigue
on the high seas tonight...

219
00:11:40,022 --> 00:11:42,456
as dozens of local pirates
were arrested...

220
00:11:42,558 --> 00:11:45,220
for protesting the yacht club's
discriminatory policies.

221
00:11:45,328 --> 00:11:47,159
<i>Even Michael's brother Gob made the news.</i>

222
00:11:47,263 --> 00:11:50,926
It was Mr. Bluth's son
Gob, a part-time magician...

223
00:11:51,033 --> 00:11:54,366
who hid his father here
in the Aztec Tomb.

224
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:56,563
By pushing on this pivoting panel...

225
00:11:56,672 --> 00:11:59,664
I have to think the Alliance
is gonna frown on this.

226
00:11:59,775 --> 00:12:01,800
Perhaps a good trick for a human...

227
00:12:01,911 --> 00:12:04,471
but the dogs found him
almost instantly.

228
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,775
<i>Free at last, darlings.</i>

229
00:12:06,883 --> 00:12:08,942
- I'm all right.
- Thank God.

230
00:12:09,051 --> 00:12:11,281
Oh, what an adventure.
Oh, my goodness!

231
00:12:11,387 --> 00:12:13,947
Buster! Don't do that.

232
00:12:14,056 --> 00:12:16,081
What an adventure, gang.

233
00:12:16,192 --> 00:12:18,683
I thought that
the homosexuals were pirates...

234
00:12:18,794 --> 00:12:22,525
but it turns out that most of them
were actors in the local theater.

235
00:12:24,767 --> 00:12:26,860
You're right though.
It is amazing.

236
00:12:26,969 --> 00:12:30,598
I've been waiting for the universe
to provide a path for me, and...

237
00:12:30,706 --> 00:12:32,867
and I think it has.

238
00:12:32,975 --> 00:12:35,671
- You're gay?
- No. No.

239
00:12:35,778 --> 00:12:40,511
I'm not... I'm not gay. No. Lindsay,
how many times must we have this...

240
00:12:40,616 --> 00:12:44,643
No. I want to be an actor.

241
00:12:48,624 --> 00:12:52,583
<i>Okay, guys. Um, they are gonna
keep Dad in prison...</i>

242
00:12:52,695 --> 00:12:54,993
at least until this gets all sorted out.

243
00:12:55,097 --> 00:12:58,863
Also, the attorney said they're gonna have to
put a halt on the company's expense account.

244
00:13:00,736 --> 00:13:04,365
Interesting. I would have expected that
after the "keeping Dad in jail."

245
00:13:04,473 --> 00:13:08,239
You know, Michael,
Dad did name Mom as his successor.

246
00:13:08,344 --> 00:13:11,973
- And I'm putting Buster in charge.
- That's a good choice.

247
00:13:12,081 --> 00:13:15,915
Buster? The guy who thought that
the blue on the map was land?

248
00:13:16,018 --> 00:13:19,010
- He's had business classes.
- Wa-Wa-Wa-Wait.

249
00:13:19,121 --> 00:13:21,589
Eighteenth-century agrarian business.

250
00:13:21,691 --> 00:13:24,660
But I guess it's all the same principles.

251
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,990
Are you at all concerned
about an uprising?

252
00:13:27,096 --> 00:13:31,897
That's it. I'm done. I'm sick and tired of
the greed and the selfishness and the taking.

253
00:13:32,001 --> 00:13:34,401
Forget it.
I've got a son to think about.

254
00:13:34,503 --> 00:13:37,267
And, Lindsay, by the way,
I expected this from them...

255
00:13:37,373 --> 00:13:39,273
because they're completely oblivious.

256
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:42,776
But you...
you should know better.

257
00:13:42,878 --> 00:13:46,712
<i>In the days that followed,
Lindsay had no choice...</i>

258
00:13:46,816 --> 00:13:50,718
<i>but to check her family
out of the hotel earlier than planned.</i>

259
00:13:57,193 --> 00:13:59,218
<i>And her husband
started looking for work.</i>

260
00:13:59,328 --> 00:14:01,694
My name is Dr. Tobias Fünke.

261
00:14:01,797 --> 00:14:05,995
I was Chief Resident of Psychiatry
at Mass General for two years...

262
00:14:06,102 --> 00:14:09,560
and I did my fellowship
in psycholinguistics at M.I.T.

263
00:14:09,672 --> 00:14:14,006
<i>And this is "I'm a Bad, Bad Man"
from Annie Get Your Gun.</i>

264
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:24,076
<i>Lucille was finding it
difficult to go about her daily life.</i>

265
00:14:24,186 --> 00:14:28,088
The S.E.C. is making him out to be some kind
of mastermind, which... believe me... he's not.

266
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:30,784
The man can barely work our shredder.

267
00:14:30,893 --> 00:14:34,795
<i>Michael was able to secure a job with a rival
housing company almost immediately.</i>

268
00:14:34,897 --> 00:14:38,128
We'll set you up in Arizona
in one of our finest estates.

269
00:14:38,234 --> 00:14:41,635
Attic or main house?

270
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:48,009
<i>And Buster was discovering
his academic pursuits...</i>

271
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:50,442
<i>didn't fully prepare him
for his new responsibilities.</i>

272
00:14:50,546 --> 00:14:53,140
Have you looked at the latest figures
on the Sudden Valley expansion...

273
00:14:53,249 --> 00:14:55,479
vis-à-vis the development
versus the tax...

274
00:14:55,584 --> 00:14:59,350
<i>- You guys are so smart.
- Two percent per annum.
This is a non-recoupable...</i>

275
00:14:59,455 --> 00:15:01,423
We need Michael.

276
00:15:01,524 --> 00:15:05,255
- We need ice.
- Michael. We need Michael.

277
00:15:05,361 --> 00:15:08,455
<i>And so the family
staged an intervention.</i>

278
00:15:08,564 --> 00:15:11,795
I'm sorry. What exactly
is this intervention for?

279
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:17,030
<i>We need you to come back
and run the business.</i>

280
00:15:17,139 --> 00:15:21,633
Okay. So technically it's not really
an intervention. It's more of an imposition.

281
00:15:21,744 --> 00:15:24,440
- Whatever you want to call it.
- I'd love to call it an imposition.

282
00:15:24,547 --> 00:15:27,880
We're in trouble here, Michael.
And I can't perform my magic.

283
00:15:27,983 --> 00:15:30,474
I'm getting blackballed
from even the smaller venues.

284
00:15:30,586 --> 00:15:34,386
I'll be honest. I'm just more comfortable
with an Alliance-approved magician.

285
00:15:37,059 --> 00:15:40,153
Give 'em a hell of a show, champ.

286
00:15:40,262 --> 00:15:42,560
off, traitor.

287
00:15:44,433 --> 00:15:46,628
Can you believe this?
They're still fighting.

288
00:15:46,735 --> 00:15:51,331
Yeah, I know. I'm tempted to kiss again
so we could teach 'em a lesson.

289
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,533
Why would that teach them a lesson?

290
00:15:53,642 --> 00:15:56,668
No, I mean, uh, to freak them out.

291
00:15:56,779 --> 00:15:59,577
- That doesn't make any sense.
- Isn't that what makes it funny?

292
00:15:59,682 --> 00:16:02,810
I'm laughing.
Go fish... Uno... Okay.

293
00:16:02,918 --> 00:16:05,716
- I just need a drink.
- Well, I'm sorry. It's just too late.

294
00:16:05,821 --> 00:16:08,051
I'm moving to Phoenix.
I got a job.

295
00:16:11,527 --> 00:16:15,054
Something you apply for,
and then they pay you to, uh...

296
00:16:15,164 --> 00:16:18,065
Never mind. I don't want to ruin
the surprise. So, no hard feelings.

297
00:16:18,167 --> 00:16:21,432
<i>Adios. Sayonara. I'll see you
when the first parent dies.</i>

298
00:16:21,537 --> 00:16:25,064
Well, I'd rather be dead in California
than alive in Arizona.

299
00:16:25,174 --> 00:16:27,870
<i>- Touché.
- George Michael, grab the coat.</i>

300
00:16:27,977 --> 00:16:30,241
I think Dad would really
want you to help us out here.

301
00:16:30,346 --> 00:16:34,874
- Dad's in jail. Here we go.
- Well, the least you could do
is say good-bye to him.

302
00:16:34,984 --> 00:16:39,353
<i>In fact, Michael had not
spoken to his father since the arrest...</i>

303
00:16:39,455 --> 00:16:43,084
<i>and he decided to give his father
the courtesy of a formal resignation.</i>

304
00:16:43,192 --> 00:16:47,060
- I quit.
- Probably a good career move.

305
00:16:49,865 --> 00:16:52,959
You know, I parked in the same spot
for the last five years.

306
00:16:53,068 --> 00:16:55,730
I was there on time every single day.

307
00:16:55,838 --> 00:16:57,772
- Mike...
- I was so loyal. I worked so hard.

308
00:16:57,873 --> 00:17:00,137
- Why didn't you just put me in charge?
- Michael, listen to me.

309
00:17:00,242 --> 00:17:02,608
These guys, the S.E.C.,
they've been after me for years.

310
00:17:02,711 --> 00:17:05,544
I put you in charge, you're gonna
be wearing one of these jumpsuits too.

311
00:17:05,648 --> 00:17:08,276
- I could've helped...
- You'd be an accomplice.

312
00:17:08,384 --> 00:17:10,443
No. It had to be your mom.

313
00:17:14,356 --> 00:17:18,224
They cannot arrest
a husband and wife...

314
00:17:18,327 --> 00:17:20,625
for the same crime.

315
00:17:23,732 --> 00:17:25,825
Yeah, I don't think
that that's true, Dad.

316
00:17:25,935 --> 00:17:28,403
Really?

317
00:17:30,906 --> 00:17:33,272
I got the worst...
attorneys.

318
00:17:34,743 --> 00:17:36,643
<i>With Michael leaving town...</i>

319
00:17:36,745 --> 00:17:40,181
<i>Lindsay decided to take inventory
of the family's last remaining asset:</i>

320
00:17:40,282 --> 00:17:42,614
<i>their model home.</i>

321
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:46,781
- What are you doing?
- Packing up. What are you doing?

322
00:17:46,889 --> 00:17:51,258
Well, just looking for... you.

323
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,329
- To say good-bye to you.
- Gonna miss you guys.

324
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:58,196
Oh, well. We'll come out
and see you in...

325
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,825
Yeah. We'll miss you too.

326
00:18:00,936 --> 00:18:04,997
It's been nice having you guys around...
you know, to talk to.

327
00:18:05,107 --> 00:18:08,304
<i>Well, since Mom died,
it's been kind of lonely and...</i>

328
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:11,538
I just wish
we could all stay here.

329
00:18:13,415 --> 00:18:15,883
- l... I need a hand with the van, please.
- Okay.

330
00:18:15,985 --> 00:18:17,885
Sorry.

331
00:18:37,206 --> 00:18:39,834
<i>Well, l-I guess he
really misses his family.</i>

332
00:18:39,942 --> 00:18:43,537
- Well, he doesn't know us very well.
- Yeah, clearly.

333
00:18:43,646 --> 00:18:47,343
Let me ask you a question. Where the hell
have you been? Why didn't you call me?

334
00:18:47,449 --> 00:18:49,849
Look at my life, Michael.

335
00:18:49,952 --> 00:18:53,888
Tobias is out of work.
We're in debt. It's...

336
00:18:58,861 --> 00:19:01,591
What are you doing?
Are you trying to cry?

337
00:19:01,697 --> 00:19:06,396
I'm sad. Life is hard right now.
I've got theJ.D.L. on my ass.

338
00:19:06,502 --> 00:19:10,097
- J.D.L.?
- Jewish Defense League.

339
00:19:10,205 --> 00:19:13,174
Oh, the circumcision thing?
This is why I was against HOOP.

340
00:19:13,275 --> 00:19:16,711
- Why didn't you just mind your own business?
- This is why I didn't call you!

341
00:19:16,812 --> 00:19:19,906
- You're so judgmental.
- No, I'm not judgmental.

342
00:19:20,015 --> 00:19:22,540
- And you're disappointed in me.
- I'm not disappointed in you.

343
00:19:22,651 --> 00:19:25,449
- You are.
- So I'm disappointed in you.

344
00:19:25,554 --> 00:19:28,216
But come on. What is not
disappointing about my life?

345
00:19:28,324 --> 00:19:31,782
Dad didn't give me the promotion.
Dad's in jail. How disappointing is that?

346
00:19:31,894 --> 00:19:34,795
- We're a disappointing family.
- We're an incredibly disappointing family.

347
00:19:36,498 --> 00:19:39,899
But we are a family,
and I want my son to be happy.

348
00:19:40,002 --> 00:19:44,632
So maybe we should be
in each other's lives.

349
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:47,903
- I'd like that.
- Yeah?

350
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:54,377
- Seriously, you're gonna pull a muscle.
- I used to be able to do this.

351
00:19:54,483 --> 00:19:56,883
<i>So Michael decided to stay in California...</i>

352
00:19:56,985 --> 00:19:59,112
<i>and try to save the family business.</i>

353
00:19:59,221 --> 00:20:02,622
<i>And for the first time ever, he gathered
his family together in the model home.</i>

354
00:20:02,725 --> 00:20:05,421
- Dad was always banker,
so there was no beating him.
- Totally.

355
00:20:05,527 --> 00:20:08,724
He should've been stocking up
on those "get out of jail free" cards.

356
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:12,995
- Good one, George Michael!
- Very good.

357
00:20:13,102 --> 00:20:16,833
<i>- Two hundred for Short Line.
- I wish you guys didn't have to go so soon.</i>

358
00:20:16,939 --> 00:20:21,205
<i>Oh, on that subject, these guys
are actually gonna be staying with us.</i>

359
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:24,939
For a while. Just your aunt
and her husband. Not Gob.

360
00:20:25,047 --> 00:20:27,914
- Really?
- Yeah. What the hell, huh? Family first.

361
00:20:28,016 --> 00:20:32,350
It is gonna be a little crowded, so you're
gonna have to share a room with your cousin.

362
00:20:36,925 --> 00:20:38,688
<i>On the next Arrested Development...</i>

363
00:20:38,794 --> 00:20:40,921
<i>George Michael gets a new roommate.</i>

364
00:20:43,298 --> 00:20:45,664
It was really your brother
we were interested in.

365
00:20:45,768 --> 00:20:48,532
I mean, you don't even
have any references.

366
00:20:48,637 --> 00:20:51,765
<i>Is that enough
of a reference for you?</i>

367
00:20:51,874 --> 00:20:54,866
<i>And Michael finds it
difficult to get his father out of jail.</i>

368
00:20:54,977 --> 00:20:56,877
You love it here?

369
00:20:56,979 --> 00:20:59,914
Oh, I'm having the time of my life!

370
00:21:00,015 --> 00:21:01,915
Hey, T-Bone.
