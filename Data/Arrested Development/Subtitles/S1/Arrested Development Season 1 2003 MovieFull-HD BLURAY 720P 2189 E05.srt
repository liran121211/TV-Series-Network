00:00:04,641 --> 00:00:07,610
<i>Michael Bluth
arrived home to find the rental car...</i>

2
00:00:07,711 --> 00:00:10,271
<i>his sister, Lindsay,
had promised to return.</i>

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,476
<i>Lindsay, you have to cut back on everything.
I'm even selling the corporatejet.</i>

4
00:00:14,585 --> 00:00:17,281
<i>Great. So now we don't have
a car or a jet?</i>

5
00:00:17,387 --> 00:00:20,117
<i>Why don't we just take an ad out
in I'm Poor magazine?</i>

6
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:23,159
I'm trying to get development started.
All right?

7
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,127
- I've got six bulldozers
waiting to get underway.
- Bulldozing?

8
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:30,223
- What about the trees?
- We're just gonna cover them up with blankets.

9
00:00:30,334 --> 00:00:33,531
- I'm ripping them out.
- Anything for a buck, right?

10
00:00:33,637 --> 00:00:35,969
You are so materialistic.

11
00:00:36,073 --> 00:00:39,736
- Don't suddenly turn this
into one of your causes.
- It's not sudden, Michael.

12
00:00:39,843 --> 00:00:43,574
I've always been deeply passionate about
nature. Perhaps you remember Neuterfest?

13
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,477
I'll never forget your wedding.

14
00:00:45,582 --> 00:00:47,573
I care deeply for nature.

15
00:00:47,684 --> 00:00:51,586
- You're wearing ostrich skin boots.
- I don't care about ostriches.

16
00:00:51,688 --> 00:00:53,781
You're looking at
a desperate man, Michael.

17
00:00:53,891 --> 00:00:56,519
- Do you need money?
- What I need is freedom.

18
00:00:56,627 --> 00:01:00,996
Marta is being
interviewed today on TV...

19
00:01:01,098 --> 00:01:04,534
<i>about her show,
El Amor Prohibido.</i>

20
00:01:04,635 --> 00:01:07,536
It's bad enough that I gotta go to
the awards show tomorrow night.

21
00:01:07,638 --> 00:01:10,801
Today I gotta stand next to her
like I'm Rita Wilson.

22
00:01:10,908 --> 00:01:14,469
<i>Gob's girlfriend Marta
had been nominated for a daytime Desi...</i>

23
00:01:14,578 --> 00:01:18,309
<i>the award given for excellence
in Spanish daytime television.</i>

24
00:01:18,415 --> 00:01:20,815
You found a woman
who believes in you.

25
00:01:20,918 --> 00:01:23,682
You should make a commitment to her,
'cause life is short.

26
00:01:23,787 --> 00:01:26,187
I would give anything
to be able to have that again.

27
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:29,157
You know? A family?
Nothing else matters.

28
00:01:29,259 --> 00:01:30,954
<i>- Michael!
- That's Mom. Hide.</i>

29
00:01:31,061 --> 00:01:32,961
You brought up money earlier.

30
00:01:33,063 --> 00:01:35,361
I actually would like
to borrow some.

31
00:01:35,465 --> 00:01:36,989
<i>- No.
- Michael?</i>

32
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,625
- He's in here, Mom!
- Come on.

33
00:01:39,736 --> 00:01:42,637
No way. That's mine.
Give it to me!

34
00:01:42,739 --> 00:01:46,004
Gob, wait! I need those tickets!

35
00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:49,010
He promised me tickets
to his girlfriend's awards show.

36
00:01:49,112 --> 00:01:50,704
You're going to that thing?

37
00:01:50,814 --> 00:01:53,112
Well, my dear friend
Lucille Austero...

38
00:01:53,216 --> 00:01:55,480
is part owner
of a television station...

39
00:01:55,586 --> 00:01:58,987
and I want to show up
and hold my head high.

40
00:01:59,089 --> 00:02:02,024
I may not have her money anymore,
but at least I have a live husband.

41
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:05,026
Ah, she's lucky to have you
as a friend.

42
00:02:06,096 --> 00:02:07,825
<i>- Buster.
- Hey, brother.</i>

43
00:02:07,931 --> 00:02:10,832
Uh, Mom said you could
tie this for me.

44
00:02:10,934 --> 00:02:15,200
Make it long so Buster
doesn't seem so... round.

45
00:02:15,305 --> 00:02:17,205
- Come here, pal.
- Thank you.

46
00:02:17,307 --> 00:02:21,004
- Do you guys got a big date?
- Well, we're not dating.

47
00:02:21,111 --> 00:02:22,942
Nonetheless...
Come here...

48
00:02:23,046 --> 00:02:24,946
shouldn't Buster
be spending his evenings...

49
00:02:25,048 --> 00:02:28,040
with women that aren't so much...
his mother?

50
00:02:28,151 --> 00:02:31,348
He's a beautiful boy.
They don't appreciate him.

51
00:02:31,455 --> 00:02:34,686
It's his glasses.
They make him look like a lizard.

52
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:39,026
- Plus, he's self-conscious.
- Gee, I wonder why.

53
00:02:39,129 --> 00:02:41,393
<i>When's the last time
you went on a date?</i>

54
00:02:41,498 --> 00:02:45,901
I just haven't met anybody
who's not self-absorbed and impossible
to have a conversation with.

55
00:02:46,003 --> 00:02:48,403
If that's a veiled criticism
about me...

56
00:02:48,505 --> 00:02:51,065
I won't hear it
and I won't respond to it.

57
00:02:51,174 --> 00:02:53,142
Hmm.
Maybe I'm wrong.

58
00:02:53,243 --> 00:02:56,872
<i>Later that day Michael
finalized the sale of the corporatejet...</i>

59
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,575
<i>and was also able to solve
the family's transportation problem.</i>

60
00:03:00,684 --> 00:03:02,208
Hmm?

61
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,879
I am not riding in that thing.

62
00:03:04,988 --> 00:03:07,718
Well, we sold the jet, and they didn't
want this. What am I gonna do?

63
00:03:07,824 --> 00:03:10,088
Besides, Lindsay, it's not
like you're materialistic.

64
00:03:10,193 --> 00:03:12,889
<i>Well, then, it's all yours.</i>

65
00:03:12,996 --> 00:03:15,191
Watch out for bridges
and hop-ons.

66
00:03:15,298 --> 00:03:17,960
You're gonna get some hop-ons.

67
00:03:18,068 --> 00:03:19,968
<i>And Michael was finally prepared...</i>

68
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:22,971
<i>to begin the next phase
of the family business.</i>

69
00:03:23,073 --> 00:03:25,769
<i>We go to Trisha Thoon for more.</i>

70
00:03:25,876 --> 00:03:29,676
An activist known as Johnny Bark
has taken residence in this beloved tree...

71
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,680
and refuses to come down.

72
00:03:31,782 --> 00:03:33,682
What is he protesting?

73
00:03:33,784 --> 00:03:36,514
The expansion of high-cost,
low-quality mini-mansions...

74
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,520
like this one here.

75
00:03:40,524 --> 00:03:42,788
You gotta be kidding me.

76
00:03:47,773 --> 00:03:47,873
<i>Michael met with his sister
about the activist in the tree.</i>

77
00:03:47,873 --> 00:03:50,842
<i>Michael met with his sister
about the activist in the tree.</i>

78
00:03:50,942 --> 00:03:52,842
<i>You want me to get him out?</i>

79
00:03:52,944 --> 00:03:55,071
Oh, come on, It's one tree.

80
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,081
After we get that lot cleared,
we're gonna have enough money...

81
00:03:58,183 --> 00:04:01,311
for you to neuter thousands of animals.

82
00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:03,910
You can make dogs and cats a complete
thing of the past. No more dogs and cats.

83
00:04:04,022 --> 00:04:06,388
<i>And we will have enough money...</i>

84
00:04:06,491 --> 00:04:09,722
for me to replace the stair car
with a normal car.

85
00:04:09,828 --> 00:04:12,353
I'll do it for the cats.

86
00:04:12,464 --> 00:04:14,864
<i>Meanwhile,
Marta's interview was underway...</i>

87
00:04:14,966 --> 00:04:18,367
<i>and Gob was getting uncomfortable
playing the supportive role.</i>

88
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:21,906
I just told him that
we are this family now...

89
00:04:22,007 --> 00:04:24,976
and that career's one thing,
but family is forever.

90
00:04:26,645 --> 00:04:29,113
I, too, have an announcement to make.

91
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:34,350
To prove that no prison can hold me...

92
00:04:34,452 --> 00:04:37,979
I will incarcerate myself in the penitentiary
that holds my own father...

93
00:04:38,089 --> 00:04:40,990
only to escape 24 hours later.

94
00:04:41,092 --> 00:04:43,390
No shackles can hold these hands.

95
00:04:44,963 --> 00:04:46,863
Say that to them in Spanish.

96
00:04:46,965 --> 00:04:49,900
<i>The next day, Michael
got a call to meet Gob at the prison.</i>

97
00:04:50,001 --> 00:04:53,562
<i>You're going into prison? I thought
there was something wrong with Dad.</i>

98
00:04:53,672 --> 00:04:56,903
What? No, Dad's fine. Just saw him in there
throwing the ball around with a couple guys.

99
00:04:57,008 --> 00:04:59,875
Which, of course,
he never did with me.

100
00:04:59,978 --> 00:05:03,243
- How did you get them to agree to this?
- Oh, the warden's a fan.

101
00:05:03,348 --> 00:05:05,248
You really think
you can break out of my prison?

102
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:08,046
You won't even know I was here.

103
00:05:08,153 --> 00:05:10,747
<i>The warden was intrigued...
less about the stunt...</i>

104
00:05:10,856 --> 00:05:14,622
<i>and more about the prison beatings
this brash magician was sure to receive.</i>

105
00:05:14,726 --> 00:05:17,126
Well, any press is good press, huh?

106
00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:19,129
Right.

107
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:23,065
<i>So Gob went about swallowing
the key to prepare for his escape.</i>

108
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:50,818
Then I pass the key, bust out of prison
and into magic history.

109
00:05:50,929 --> 00:05:54,695
Of course, that is gonna conflict
with my going to the Desis with Marta.

110
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:56,960
Well, life's a compromise.

111
00:05:57,068 --> 00:06:00,299
I probably would have taken her
to the nice event, but prison'll be fun too.

112
00:06:00,405 --> 00:06:01,439
- Thank you. I knew you'd come through.
- How'd I come through?

113
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:03,373
- Thank you. I knew you'd come through.
- How'd I come through?

114
00:06:03,475 --> 00:06:05,966
Gob, how'd I come through?

115
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:12,346
<i>You might wanna find something
a little stronger, Warden.</i>

116
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:14,611
What is your problem?

117
00:06:14,719 --> 00:06:19,986
<i>Meanwhile, Lindsay set about
fulfilling her promise to Michael.</i>

118
00:06:24,663 --> 00:06:26,790
Get out of our tree.

119
00:06:26,898 --> 00:06:30,026
<i>At this moment, Maeby
found another opportunity to rebel.</i>

120
00:06:30,135 --> 00:06:33,036
<i>- We have to save this tree.
- We have to!</i>

121
00:06:33,138 --> 00:06:37,040
<i>And George Sr.
was about to be surprised by his son.</i>

122
00:06:37,142 --> 00:06:39,542
Keep your arm up.
That's how you get accuracy.

123
00:06:39,644 --> 00:06:42,044
Thought you said throwing the ball
against the garage door by yourself...

124
00:06:42,147 --> 00:06:43,739
was how you got accuracy.

125
00:06:43,848 --> 00:06:45,975
- Gob, what are you doing here?
- Life, Dad.

126
00:06:46,084 --> 00:06:48,644
I killed a guy.

127
00:06:48,753 --> 00:06:52,018
Nah, it's just a publicity stunt.
I'm gonna bust out tomorrow.

128
00:06:52,123 --> 00:06:54,853
- Impressive, no?
- You idiot. You're gonna get yourself killed.

129
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,623
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize
there weren't any magic fans here.

130
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:01,528
Hey, White Power Bill, he's all right.

131
00:07:01,633 --> 00:07:05,296
White Power Bill can't hear you...
with such dirty ears.

132
00:07:05,403 --> 00:07:08,770
Hey, White Power Bill has dirty ears.
Hey, guys!

133
00:07:08,873 --> 00:07:11,899
Dirty Ears Bill!
Dirty Ears Bill!

134
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:14,877
<i>And Michael was
about to get a surprise visit ofhis own.</i>

135
00:07:20,385 --> 00:07:22,285
Michael?

136
00:07:22,387 --> 00:07:25,379
Yes? Hi. I'm Michael.

137
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,458
I'm Marta.

138
00:07:28,827 --> 00:07:30,727
<i>You're Marta?</i>

139
00:07:30,829 --> 00:07:33,263
Thank you so much
for taking me to the awards.

140
00:07:33,365 --> 00:07:35,765
Gob said he really appreciated
you coming through for him.

141
00:07:35,867 --> 00:07:37,596
Oh. Sure. Yeah.

142
00:07:37,702 --> 00:07:39,693
This is how I came through, huh?

143
00:07:39,804 --> 00:07:41,704
Listen, Marta...

144
00:07:41,806 --> 00:07:44,707
I hope you don't mind driving.
I took a cab here.

145
00:07:44,809 --> 00:07:47,903
- I just couldn't find my keys.
- Well, my brother may have eaten them.

146
00:07:48,013 --> 00:07:49,537
Look...

147
00:07:52,584 --> 00:07:57,044
Um... I haven't hired
a limo or anything.

148
00:07:57,155 --> 00:08:00,818
- I don't mind.
- I think you might.

149
00:08:10,035 --> 00:08:13,766
<i>Look, I'm an activist too. I appreciate
what you're doing for the environment.</i>

150
00:08:13,872 --> 00:08:16,670
But we're not the only ones
who destroy trees.

151
00:08:16,775 --> 00:08:18,174
What about beavers?

152
00:08:18,276 --> 00:08:21,268
You call yourself an environmentalist?
Go club some beavers.

153
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:24,940
<i>You don't really
get nature, do ya?</i>

154
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:28,019
It will be torn down,
with or without you.

155
00:08:29,554 --> 00:08:31,579
Where are the stairs?

156
00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:34,089
<i>Meanwhile, the Desis were underway.</i>

157
00:08:37,128 --> 00:08:39,358
<i>Guillermo Ortiz
como El Ratón...</i>

158
00:08:39,464 --> 00:08:41,694
<i>Pablo Dominguez
como Pepito...</i>

159
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,360
<i>Felicio Colón
como Miguelito...</i>

160
00:08:44,469 --> 00:08:47,870
<i>And Lucille was mingling with the elite
of the Latino Television Academy.</i>

161
00:08:47,972 --> 00:08:49,963
Can I get a vodka tonic, please?

162
00:08:50,075 --> 00:08:53,772
I'd like a vodka tonic.
Vodka tonic, please?

163
00:08:53,878 --> 00:08:56,506
A sea of waiters,
and no one will take a drink order.

164
00:08:56,614 --> 00:08:58,514
<i>Buster was also mingling...</i>

165
00:08:58,616 --> 00:09:01,517
<i>but, at Lucille's insistence,
wasn't wearing his glasses.</i>

166
00:09:01,619 --> 00:09:03,587
<i>? Cómo estoy?</i>

167
00:09:06,224 --> 00:09:08,488
Exciting night.

168
00:09:10,662 --> 00:09:14,621
<i>And Lucille Bluth crossed paths
with Lucille Austero.</i>

169
00:09:16,835 --> 00:09:18,393
Lucille?

170
00:09:18,503 --> 00:09:20,232
Lucille!

171
00:09:20,338 --> 00:09:22,238
- Well, aren't you something?
- Oh!

172
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,740
Showing up here
without your husband.

173
00:09:24,843 --> 00:09:27,403
Shame be damned.
Caution to the wind.

174
00:09:27,512 --> 00:09:30,913
That's so sweet, darling.
I'm here to support you.

175
00:09:31,015 --> 00:09:33,916
You're the one who's all alone
and likely to stay that way.

176
00:09:34,018 --> 00:09:36,578
My husband's
just a phone call away.

177
00:09:36,688 --> 00:09:39,589
That's one call per day,
isn't it?

178
00:09:39,691 --> 00:09:42,888
Gee, I should think
he'd wanna save that for his lawyer.

179
00:09:42,994 --> 00:09:45,758
At least he's in prison,
not an urn.

180
00:09:48,967 --> 00:09:51,265
You are so deliciously witty.

181
00:09:51,369 --> 00:09:53,064
Aren't we having fun?

182
00:09:53,171 --> 00:09:57,335
<i>The other Lucille
also suffers from severe vertigo.</i>

183
00:10:13,391 --> 00:10:15,621
<i>Lucille Austero, meanwhile...</i>

184
00:10:15,727 --> 00:10:18,628
<i>perhaps because she'd never seen him
without his glasses...</i>

185
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:20,630
<i>first took notice of Buster.</i>

186
00:10:27,906 --> 00:10:31,034
<i>Buster, however, failed to notice her...</i>

187
00:10:33,244 --> 00:10:35,144
<i>and she sent him a proposition.</i>

188
00:10:35,246 --> 00:10:38,306
Excuse me, sir.
This is for you.

189
00:10:44,522 --> 00:10:46,114
Huh?

190
00:10:46,224 --> 00:10:48,124
<i>Finally, Marta's category was announced.</i>

191
00:10:48,226 --> 00:10:50,217
<i>?: Yel Desi va a...</i>

192
00:10:51,362 --> 00:10:53,887
Sandra Elena Higuera!

193
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:07,037
Marta? Hey.

194
00:11:07,145 --> 00:11:10,114
I'm sorry.
You really deserved to win in there.

195
00:11:12,417 --> 00:11:15,181
Did you win?
l-I don't speak Spanish.

196
00:11:15,286 --> 00:11:17,015
It's not about the award.

197
00:11:17,121 --> 00:11:20,488
It's crazy, but I thought
it would make Gob proud.

198
00:11:20,592 --> 00:11:22,457
I'm sure, in his own way,
that he's...

199
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,259
I just think he doesn't understand family.
You know, commitment.

200
00:11:27,365 --> 00:11:30,823
But those are the only things
that matter in life.

201
00:11:30,935 --> 00:11:33,699
<i>At that moment
Michael realized that this was...</i>

202
00:11:33,805 --> 00:11:36,171
<i>the most beautiful woman
he'd ever seen.</i>

203
00:11:36,274 --> 00:11:40,506
<i>For the first time since he lost his wife,
he wanted someone.</i>

204
00:11:46,417 --> 00:11:49,477
<i>At the same moment,
Gob was ready to retrieve the key...</i>

205
00:11:49,587 --> 00:11:50,952
<i>to execute his escape.</i>

206
00:11:51,055 --> 00:11:53,615
Is there a private bathroom nearby?

207
00:11:55,727 --> 00:11:58,491
- You're looking at it.
- No, I can't use that.

208
00:11:58,596 --> 00:12:01,633
No, no, I need privacy.
Yeah, I've always been that way.

209
00:12:01,633 --> 00:12:02,691
No, no, I need privacy.
Yeah, I've always been that way.

210
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,495
I can't go without privacy.

211
00:12:04,602 --> 00:12:06,797
I c... I can't pass this key
without privacy!

212
00:12:06,904 --> 00:12:09,464
Well, I could ask the guys
to leave, but, uh...

213
00:12:09,574 --> 00:12:11,474
they've been
locking the doors lately.

214
00:12:11,576 --> 00:12:13,407
l...

215
00:12:15,113 --> 00:12:17,240
I've made a huge mistake.

216
00:12:19,892 --> 00:12:23,055
<i>Michael was having
a wonderful time with Marta and
didn't want the evening to end...</i>

217
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:27,294
<i>while Lindsay was bonding
with the man in the tree.</i>

218
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:30,129
You have no idea
what it's like to save a living thing.

219
00:12:30,235 --> 00:12:32,465
Well, for your information, I do.

220
00:12:32,571 --> 00:12:36,473
My husband, Tobias, and I used to
do this kind of thing all the time.

221
00:12:36,575 --> 00:12:39,476
I guess that's why
I was so attracted to him.

222
00:12:39,578 --> 00:12:42,479
He was a serious
and committed advocate for change.

223
00:12:42,581 --> 00:12:43,673
Where is he now?

224
00:12:43,782 --> 00:12:47,081
At a weekend stage fighting workshop
with Carl Weathers.

225
00:12:48,921 --> 00:12:51,321
But he used to believe in things.

226
00:12:51,423 --> 00:12:53,983
We both used to.

227
00:12:54,093 --> 00:12:58,655
Sorry, Lindsay.
I didn't realize you were up there.

228
00:12:58,764 --> 00:13:02,097
Oh, I'm up here, Mike,
and I'm not coming down!

229
00:13:03,435 --> 00:13:06,893
I'm gonna save this tree,
no matter what it takes.

230
00:13:07,005 --> 00:13:11,101
<i>Okay. I'll see you when you
realize what that bucket's for.</i>

231
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:13,940
I can see why your mom likes it.
It is a really nice tree...

232
00:13:14,046 --> 00:13:15,946
We've gotta get it torn down.

233
00:13:16,048 --> 00:13:19,347
That must die... stupid tree.

234
00:13:22,354 --> 00:13:24,584
- Buster's out of control.
- Another panic attack?

235
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:29,252
Me? No. She's just wigged out
because I have a girlfriend.

236
00:13:29,361 --> 00:13:32,262
A waiter hands him a note;
suddenly he's Steve McQueen.

237
00:13:32,364 --> 00:13:34,832
He doesn't even know
what she looks like.

238
00:13:34,933 --> 00:13:37,367
I know she's a brownish area
with points.

239
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,960
And I know I love her.

240
00:13:40,072 --> 00:13:42,131
I'm calling Dr. Miller.

241
00:13:46,478 --> 00:13:48,537
<i>Okay, I don't know
I love her...</i>

242
00:13:48,647 --> 00:13:52,606
but I cannot tell you how liberating it is
to be with someone who's not Mom...

243
00:13:52,718 --> 00:13:54,549
who's nothing like her.

244
00:13:54,653 --> 00:13:57,554
Yeah, and you're just... you're just
jumping right into this, huh?

245
00:13:57,656 --> 00:13:59,817
Oh, yes. Yes.

246
00:13:59,925 --> 00:14:03,383
That's what you do when life hands you
a chance to be with someone special.

247
00:14:03,495 --> 00:14:06,623
You just grab that...
that brownish area by its points...

248
00:14:06,732 --> 00:14:09,633
and you don't let go,
no matter what your mom says.

249
00:14:09,735 --> 00:14:12,033
Mmm!

250
00:14:14,506 --> 00:14:16,804
Good talk.

251
00:14:16,909 --> 00:14:20,310
- Hello.
- Michael. Change of escape plan.

252
00:14:20,412 --> 00:14:22,710
I unplugged
the ice cream sandwich machine...

253
00:14:22,815 --> 00:14:25,716
and the guards are all eating them
before they get too melty...

254
00:14:25,818 --> 00:14:27,718
so I've got like a half an hour.

255
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:31,415
Meet me at the south prison wall
and bring the stairs.

256
00:14:31,523 --> 00:14:36,722
<i>Michael knew he had
an obligation to his brother.</i>

257
00:14:36,829 --> 00:14:38,729
Michael!

258
00:14:38,831 --> 00:14:40,731
Hey, Gob!

259
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,733
Where the hell are the stairs?

260
00:14:42,835 --> 00:14:45,201
Oh! I thought you were kidding!

261
00:14:45,304 --> 00:14:50,207
<i>Hey, speaking ofkidding,
how serious are you about Marta?</i>

262
00:14:50,309 --> 00:14:53,676
I get the sense that there's not much of
a future there. Am I reading that right?

263
00:14:53,779 --> 00:14:57,715
<i>Let me ask you something. How would
you feel if I came down on you hard?</i>

264
00:14:57,816 --> 00:15:00,444
You're saying
I'm not reading this right.

265
00:15:00,552 --> 00:15:03,385
No, I'm saying
I need to jump on you to break my fall.

266
00:15:03,489 --> 00:15:06,788
- Don't be an idiot. Don't jump on me.
- I have to! Stop moving!

267
00:15:06,892 --> 00:15:08,883
- Come on! Stop moving!
- Don't jump on me!

268
00:15:08,994 --> 00:15:10,894
<i>The guards soon became concerned...</i>

269
00:15:10,996 --> 00:15:14,898
<i>about the paperwork that would be
required of them if Gob actually didjump.</i>

270
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,901
<i>- Don't be such a moron!
- You're making this very, very difficult.</i>

271
00:15:18,003 --> 00:15:19,903
Ohh! God!

272
00:15:20,005 --> 00:15:22,030
This is personal...

273
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:25,234
Gob. Gob!

274
00:15:25,344 --> 00:15:27,312
Good talk.

275
00:15:30,749 --> 00:15:32,979
I'm a complete failure.

276
00:15:34,086 --> 00:15:36,247
Where'd you get
that kind of talk?

277
00:15:36,355 --> 00:15:39,984
From you.
You always say that about me.

278
00:15:41,126 --> 00:15:43,788
Well, maybe you're not
entirely to blame.

279
00:15:43,896 --> 00:15:46,421
I haven't always been
the best kind of father either.

280
00:15:46,532 --> 00:15:50,400
You've done a pretty good job
of being a father to everybody in here.

281
00:15:50,502 --> 00:15:52,800
What have they got that I don't?

282
00:15:52,905 --> 00:15:57,001
You've never even...
thrown a ball around with me.

283
00:15:58,343 --> 00:16:01,039
Great.
Now you're an athlete.

284
00:16:07,619 --> 00:16:10,520
<i>Lindsay left the tree
to sleep in her own bed...</i>

285
00:16:10,622 --> 00:16:13,318
<i>and Johnny Bark left the tree
to awaken her.</i>

286
00:16:13,425 --> 00:16:15,518
- So, Lindsay, I was thinking...
- Johnny Bark?

287
00:16:15,627 --> 00:16:17,527
- I wanna be with you, Lindsay.
- What?

288
00:16:17,629 --> 00:16:20,189
- And I know you wanna be with me too.
- No, I don't.

289
00:16:20,299 --> 00:16:24,292
But all the things you said about
commitment and believing in things...

290
00:16:24,403 --> 00:16:26,098
<i>that's the way I feel!</i>

291
00:16:26,204 --> 00:16:29,605
johnny, I'm sorry. l...
I didn't mean to lead you on.

292
00:16:30,809 --> 00:16:32,709
I think you're gross.

293
00:16:34,813 --> 00:16:37,543
- Uh-oh.
- My tree.

294
00:16:39,318 --> 00:16:42,185
That's why you never
get out of the tree.

295
00:16:42,287 --> 00:16:45,279
<i>And Gob was about to
get a reason to stay in prison.</i>

296
00:16:47,659 --> 00:16:49,559
You all right?

297
00:16:49,661 --> 00:16:51,959
Not great.

298
00:16:52,998 --> 00:16:55,125
Maybe this'll help.

299
00:16:55,233 --> 00:16:57,133
<i>And for the first time...</i>

300
00:16:57,235 --> 00:17:02,172
<i>Gob had the game of catch with his father
he'd been waiting for his whole life.</i>

301
00:17:02,274 --> 00:17:04,970
<i>Okay, ready?
Put your mitt up.</i>

302
00:17:05,077 --> 00:17:06,704
<i>There you go.</i>

303
00:17:09,514 --> 00:17:11,141
White power!

304
00:17:11,249 --> 00:17:13,740
I'm... white.

305
00:17:13,852 --> 00:17:17,083
<i>And Michael decided
to share his feelings with Marta.</i>

306
00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:19,089
- Michael.
- Marta.

307
00:17:19,191 --> 00:17:22,991
I'm not really quite sure
how to say this, but, um...

308
00:17:23,095 --> 00:17:25,029
- I had a great time last night.
- I did too.

309
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:27,030
And, um...

310
00:17:27,132 --> 00:17:30,067
we're so in synch
on so many things...

311
00:17:30,168 --> 00:17:31,863
and, uh, l-l...

312
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:35,235
You guys don't have a machine, huh?

313
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,501
- Sorry.
- Okay.

314
00:17:37,609 --> 00:17:39,338
Hello.

315
00:17:39,444 --> 00:17:41,435
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

316
00:17:41,546 --> 00:17:43,514
Gob has been
stabbed in the back.

317
00:17:51,623 --> 00:17:55,059
- Am I still in prison?
- You're in the hospital.

318
00:17:56,395 --> 00:17:58,295
? Ta-dah?

319
00:17:58,397 --> 00:18:00,763
<i>Meanwhile, Buster
was waiting in the hallway.</i>

320
00:18:00,866 --> 00:18:02,959
Buster?

321
00:18:03,068 --> 00:18:07,027
Oh, Miss Austero.
Wh-What are you doing here?

322
00:18:07,139 --> 00:18:09,972
- A touch of the dizzies.
- Oh. Oh.

323
00:18:10,075 --> 00:18:14,205
So, listen, Buster, have you given
any, uh, thought to my offer?

324
00:18:14,312 --> 00:18:16,542
I'm sorry. What?

325
00:18:17,649 --> 00:18:20,379
Well, my phone
hasn't made a peep.

326
00:18:24,723 --> 00:18:27,089
Ha... Has your hair...

327
00:18:27,192 --> 00:18:29,717
always been that pointy,
Miss Austero?

328
00:18:29,828 --> 00:18:31,557
- It's Lucille.
- Right. Right.

329
00:18:31,663 --> 00:18:33,563
That's my mom's name.

330
00:18:33,665 --> 00:18:35,565
Yes!

331
00:18:35,667 --> 00:18:37,567
Oh, God!

332
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:39,967
Buster? Buster! Bu...

333
00:18:40,072 --> 00:18:42,131
He... Oh!

334
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,573
I'm all right. I'm all right.

335
00:18:46,945 --> 00:18:49,607
<i>He's fine.
I'll be in the hospital bar.</i>

336
00:18:49,715 --> 00:18:53,014
Uh, you know, there isn't
a hospital bar, Mother.

337
00:18:53,118 --> 00:18:56,087
Well, this is why
people hate hospitals.

338
00:19:07,432 --> 00:19:10,833
<i>You were right, Michael.
Life is too short.</i>

339
00:19:10,936 --> 00:19:12,904
Mine almost ended today.

340
00:19:14,406 --> 00:19:17,534
So I think I'm gonna
work things out with Marta.

341
00:19:17,642 --> 00:19:19,542
- You are, huh?
- Yeah.

342
00:19:19,644 --> 00:19:22,204
Boy, that's, uh...

343
00:19:22,314 --> 00:19:24,282
that's great.

344
00:19:27,652 --> 00:19:30,951
- Hmm. You know what's funny?
- Mmm.

345
00:19:31,056 --> 00:19:34,958
I was gonna walk out of that prison
last night and break up with her.

346
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:38,120
Good thing you didn't
bring the stairs, huh?

347
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:41,961
Mmm. Very funny. Yeah.
It's hysterical.

348
00:19:42,067 --> 00:19:43,728
I'm lucky.

349
00:19:46,772 --> 00:19:49,969
- Can I come in now?
- Yeah, sure. He's fine.

350
00:19:50,075 --> 00:19:54,808
Listen, I really appreciate
you helping me out last night.

351
00:19:54,913 --> 00:19:57,814
Well, you know, you gotta put family first.

352
00:19:57,916 --> 00:20:00,817
That's the stupid thing that I believe.

353
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:04,013
You two keep talking out there,
I'm gonna start getting jealous.

354
00:20:08,126 --> 00:20:10,026
I was really worried about you.

355
00:20:10,128 --> 00:20:12,028
You've got nothing to worry about.

356
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:15,031
We're gonna be together
for a long time.

357
00:20:15,133 --> 00:20:17,567
<i>We're family now.</i>

358
00:20:17,669 --> 00:20:19,762
I am so happy.

359
00:20:19,871 --> 00:20:21,839
I'm gonna call the kids.

360
00:20:31,316 --> 00:20:33,944
I've made a huge mistake.

361
00:20:42,394 --> 00:20:44,225
<i>On the next Arrested Development...</i>

362
00:20:44,329 --> 00:20:46,422
<i>Gob learns how he survived
his stabbing.</i>

363
00:20:46,531 --> 00:20:49,762
Looks like the shiv would have done
some real damage if it hadn't been for this.

364
00:20:49,868 --> 00:20:52,359
It was in your lower intestine.

365
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:54,370
So close.

366
00:20:54,472 --> 00:20:56,372
<i>And Buster makes a bold move.</i>

367
00:21:00,478 --> 00:21:02,878
- Buster.
- Let's go for it.

368
00:21:03,478 --> 00:21:59,878
