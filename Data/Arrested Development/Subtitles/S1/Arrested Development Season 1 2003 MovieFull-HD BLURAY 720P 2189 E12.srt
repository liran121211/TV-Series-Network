1
00:00:00,654 --> 00:00:04,055
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:04,158 --> 00:00:06,149
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:08,251
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:13,768 --> 00:00:15,429
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

5
00:00:21,242 --> 00:00:24,075
<i>It was
Michael's sister's anniversary.
- Hi.</i>

6
00:00:24,178 --> 00:00:26,840
<i>He'd convinced his mother
to throw a party for her.</i>

7
00:00:26,947 --> 00:00:28,812
Lindsay, how's this for
an anniversary cake?

8
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:32,852
Anniversary? You asked me
to throw a Valentine's Day party.

9
00:00:32,953 --> 00:00:35,183
- Did I?
- You tricked me.

10
00:00:35,289 --> 00:00:38,452
<i>I deceived you, Mom. Tricked makes
it sound like we have a playful relationship.</i>

11
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,926
Touché. Lupe, untie the balloons!

12
00:00:44,498 --> 00:00:47,058
<i>Michael, all alone
on Valentine's Day?</i>

13
00:00:47,168 --> 00:00:49,136
How's that possible?

14
00:00:49,236 --> 00:00:51,136
You seem like such a romantic to me.

15
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:55,334
<i>l- l-I can just see you showing up
on some lucky girl's porch...</i>

16
00:00:55,443 --> 00:00:58,537
in a tuxedo
with a bottle of champagne.

17
00:00:58,646 --> 00:01:00,614
Yeah. Well, if I show up
with all that stuff...

18
00:01:00,714 --> 00:01:02,875
I could probably just get away
with shorts and a T-shirt, right?

19
00:01:02,983 --> 00:01:04,951
Which is good
'cause I don't even have a tuxedo.

20
00:01:05,052 --> 00:01:07,987
So you're saying there's no one
you're even interested in?

21
00:01:08,089 --> 00:01:10,421
<i>In fact,
Michael had become enamored of Marta...</i>

22
00:01:10,524 --> 00:01:13,584
<i>when Gob was having second thoughts
about the relationship.</i>

23
00:01:13,694 --> 00:01:16,754
<i>- I've made a huge mistake.
- But when Gob recommitted to her...</i>

24
00:01:16,864 --> 00:01:20,493
<i>- I've made a huge mistake.
- Michael decided to do the
noble thing and let her go.</i>

25
00:01:20,601 --> 00:01:25,004
There was somebody for a while,
but it was too much of a brother... bother.

26
00:01:31,412 --> 00:01:34,438
<i>That can't feel good.</i>

27
00:01:34,548 --> 00:01:36,914
It's fine. I'm over it.
I'm okay by myself, you know?

28
00:01:37,017 --> 00:01:39,918
I really just want to focus
on my family's happiness.

29
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,921
That's why I threw this party.
I mean, 14 years, huh?

30
00:01:43,023 --> 00:01:44,923
You've got to be doing
somethin' right.

31
00:01:45,025 --> 00:01:47,653
Well, if you call not filing
for divorce "something right."

32
00:01:47,761 --> 00:01:49,820
- But I guess we keep it interesting.
- Where's Tobias?

33
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,364
He's on the balcony having margaritas
with Carl Weathers.

34
00:01:52,466 --> 00:01:56,425
<i>Tobias had recently
hired actor Carl Weathers as a drama coach.</i>

35
00:01:56,537 --> 00:01:58,801
Do you see me more as
the respected dramatic actor...

36
00:01:58,906 --> 00:02:00,999
or more the beloved comic actor?

37
00:02:01,108 --> 00:02:03,941
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
There's still plenty of meat on that bone.

38
00:02:04,044 --> 00:02:07,241
You take this home, throw it in a pot.
Add some broth, a potato...

39
00:02:07,348 --> 00:02:09,873
Baby, you got a stew goin'.

40
00:02:09,984 --> 00:02:13,010
Yes, that's fine. But I would like to focus
on my acting, Mr. Weathers.

41
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,452
I did give you my last $1,100.

42
00:02:15,556 --> 00:02:18,491
Let me tell you a little story
about acting.

43
00:02:18,592 --> 00:02:21,959
<i>I was doing this Showtime movie,
Hot Ice, with Anne Archer.</i>

44
00:02:22,062 --> 00:02:24,553
Never once touched my per diem.

45
00:02:24,665 --> 00:02:28,157
I go to craft service, get some raw veggies,
bacon, cup of soup...

46
00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:30,794
Baby, I had a stew goin'.

47
00:02:31,839 --> 00:02:34,137
I think I'd like my money back.

48
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,478
<i>Like his father, George Michael
had been nursing an impossible crush.</i>

49
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,484
<i>It was on his cousin, Maeby.</i>

50
00:02:45,586 --> 00:02:49,522
<i>And with no one to talk to,
he was looking for some kind of direction.</i>

51
00:02:49,623 --> 00:02:52,217
just give me a sign.

52
00:02:53,994 --> 00:02:57,725
First one's obvious. Okay.

53
00:02:58,966 --> 00:03:01,434
<i>He continued to look for a sign.</i>

54
00:03:01,535 --> 00:03:04,402
<i>- Until finally...
- "Maybe tonight."</i>

55
00:03:04,505 --> 00:03:06,496
What are the chances?

56
00:03:06,607 --> 00:03:09,735
<i>Actually, "Maybe Tonight"
was a very popular candy slogan...</i>

57
00:03:09,843 --> 00:03:11,743
<i>and the chances were one in eight.</i>

58
00:03:11,845 --> 00:03:14,780
- What are you doin'?
- Just tryin' to throw stuff at my dad's head...

59
00:03:14,882 --> 00:03:17,146
- but the wind keeps taking it.
- Oh, cool.

60
00:03:17,251 --> 00:03:19,151
So, I, uh... I found this.

61
00:03:19,253 --> 00:03:22,313
I thought it was like a one-in-a-million thing.
It just made me think of you.

62
00:03:22,423 --> 00:03:26,519
- Oh, perfect.
- Trying to make my relation...

63
00:03:26,627 --> 00:03:28,788
<i>- I saw that.
- And Lucille...</i>

64
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:31,592
<i>found a way to force a wedge
into her son's relationship.</i>

65
00:03:31,699 --> 00:03:34,793
Lucille, guess who's coming to dinner?

66
00:03:34,902 --> 00:03:38,394
I've invited Carl
to dine with us next Tuesday.

67
00:03:38,505 --> 00:03:40,700
Mother, you know
I have class on Tuesday.

68
00:03:40,808 --> 00:03:44,608
Oh, how silly of me.

69
00:03:44,712 --> 00:03:48,011
Well, then perhaps the two of you
can have dinner alone.

70
00:03:48,115 --> 00:03:51,744
Oh, well, I never say no to dinner,
with a beautiful lady that is.

71
00:03:51,852 --> 00:03:55,049
- Do you like ham?
- No. I love it.

72
00:03:59,526 --> 00:04:02,051
<i>And the family gathered to watch a videotape...</i>

73
00:04:02,162 --> 00:04:05,461
<i>George Sr. had sent Lindsay and Tobias
for their anniversary.</i>

74
00:04:05,566 --> 00:04:08,501
Hello, I'm George Bluth...

75
00:04:08,602 --> 00:04:11,093
and for the next 45 minutes...

76
00:04:11,205 --> 00:04:13,571
let me take you on a journey...

77
00:04:13,674 --> 00:04:16,837
Good grief. He sent us
one of his idiot videotapes.

78
00:04:16,944 --> 00:04:19,879
<i>First this...
- You've seen
George Bluth on videotape.</i>

79
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,972
You have got to learn
to be alone.

80
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:26,575
I cheated and I lied.
And I whored around.

81
00:04:26,687 --> 00:04:29,815
<i>Caged Wisdom changed my life.</i>

82
00:04:29,923 --> 00:04:33,120
<i>Now is your chance to own
the entire George Bluth Caged Wisdom library...</i>

83
00:04:33,227 --> 00:04:35,127
for only four payments of 19.95.

84
00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:37,754
- This was supposed to be my anniversary toast.
- Yeah.

85
00:04:37,865 --> 00:04:40,959
And this was supposed to be
my Valentine's Day party.

86
00:04:41,068 --> 00:04:42,968
Speaking of which...

87
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,095
Lupe, where are those balloons?

88
00:04:45,205 --> 00:04:47,264
<i>You want balloons?</i>

89
00:04:49,276 --> 00:04:52,109
Speech, speech, speech...

90
00:04:52,212 --> 00:04:56,342
{Joining In]
Speech, speech, speech, speech, speech...

91
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:59,442
speech, speech, speech speech...

92
00:04:59,553 --> 00:05:01,646
- Come on, speech.
- Speech, speech, speech, speech...

93
00:05:01,755 --> 00:05:05,191
<i>The family continued
to chant, "Speech, speech, speech'...</i>

94
00:05:05,292 --> 00:05:07,624
<i>for no one in particular.</i>

95
00:05:07,728 --> 00:05:09,992
- Speech, speech...
- All right.

96
00:05:10,097 --> 00:05:11,997
Speech.

97
00:05:14,635 --> 00:05:17,035
After all that, I was kinda hoping
somebody would make a speech.

98
00:05:17,137 --> 00:05:20,129
- Speech, speech, speech...
- All right, all right, all right. I'll say something.

99
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,834
<i>- Typical.
- We've all had a tough couple of months.</i>

100
00:05:22,943 --> 00:05:25,503
I think we're all really
figuring out who we are...

101
00:05:25,612 --> 00:05:27,512
and what we really need in life.

102
00:05:27,614 --> 00:05:30,310
<i>And that can be painful.</i>

103
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:34,148
However, you can't really heal yourself
until you stop living a lie, you know.

104
00:05:34,254 --> 00:05:38,156
<i>But, uh, l-I promise that we're all
gonna be a lot happier in the long run.</i>

105
00:05:38,258 --> 00:05:40,453
So, on a very unusual
Valentine's Day...

106
00:05:40,561 --> 00:05:45,021
cheers to Mom and Dad,
to Buster and Lucille...

107
00:05:45,132 --> 00:05:47,034
- Don't forget my girlfriend.
- That's who I meant.

108
00:05:47,034 --> 00:05:48,365
- Don't forget my girlfriend.
- That's who I meant.

109
00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:52,030
To Lindsay and Tobias,
to George Michael and...

110
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:54,903
I almost said George Michael and Maeby.

111
00:05:55,008 --> 00:05:58,239
- Oh.
- Um, to Gob and Marta.

112
00:05:58,345 --> 00:06:00,506
<i>- Mmm.
- To love and happiness.</i>

113
00:06:00,614 --> 00:06:03,412
I love you all, Marta.

114
00:06:03,517 --> 00:06:06,077
<i>And Marta realized it was Michael, not Gob...</i>

115
00:06:06,186 --> 00:06:09,246
<i>who had everything
she had been looking for in a man.</i>

116
00:06:09,356 --> 00:06:12,018
I made a huge mistake.

117
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,293
<i>I was thinking about that toast
you gave at my anniversary party.</i>

118
00:06:19,397 --> 00:06:22,423
- So, I want to get a divorce.
- What?

119
00:06:22,533 --> 00:06:25,764
Do you think I should use our attorney, Barry,
or just kind of bolt in the night?

120
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,770
I'm leaning toward bolt
in the night, but...

121
00:06:27,872 --> 00:06:30,602
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Lindsay,
I wasn't talking about getting a divorce.

122
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:33,302
<i>Oh, Michael.
It's time.</i>

123
00:06:33,411 --> 00:06:36,539
The man's psychologically incapable
of taking all of his clothes off.

124
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:40,048
<i>In fact,
Tobias was a never-nude.</i>

125
00:06:40,151 --> 00:06:43,416
<i>As of yet, the D.S.M. -IV
has not acknowledged the affliction.</i>

126
00:06:43,521 --> 00:06:46,615
I don't know, Lindsay.
I mean, who am I to judge?

127
00:06:46,724 --> 00:06:48,658
On the other hand,
I am doing it anyway...

128
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:52,752
so let me suggest before you talk divorce,
at least consider a separation.

129
00:06:52,864 --> 00:06:54,764
- You know, you do have a kid.
- I know.

130
00:06:54,866 --> 00:06:57,460
I was gonna take her with me in the night.
She's part of the bolt.

131
00:06:57,568 --> 00:06:59,468
Lindsay.

132
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:01,731
All right. I'll think about it.

133
00:07:04,142 --> 00:07:06,110
- Hello?
- Hey, brother.

134
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:09,270
I just want to tell you how much
I enjoyed your speech yesterday.

135
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:12,440
You know, about family and...
and being true to ourselves.

136
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,950
Oh, well, I'm...
I'm glad it made an impact.

137
00:07:15,052 --> 00:07:18,249
Yeah. I never want
to look at Mom again.

138
00:07:18,356 --> 00:07:20,290
What happened?

139
00:07:20,391 --> 00:07:24,088
Well, I can't really talk.
She might be listening in.

140
00:07:24,195 --> 00:07:27,289
<i>Do you know she tried to set up
my girlfriend with a man?</i>

141
00:07:27,398 --> 00:07:29,923
This has to stop.

142
00:07:30,034 --> 00:07:31,934
You know, that's not really
what I was going for.

143
00:07:32,036 --> 00:07:35,767
I'm a man, Mike!
I'm a man.

144
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:37,773
Can I throw out this yogurt?

145
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,775
Buster, two things.

146
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:42,345
First of all, I think it might be time
for you to move out, you know?

147
00:07:42,446 --> 00:07:46,109
Secondly, you don't want to take any chances
with yogurt, Mom. Just let her throw it out.

148
00:07:46,217 --> 00:07:49,277
- He-Hello? Who's on this phone?
- Hey. Huh?

149
00:07:50,988 --> 00:07:52,888
<i>- Michael?
- Hey.</i>

150
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:56,517
<i>- Great speech last night.
- Oh, really? What did it inspire
you to do, kill somebody?</i>

151
00:07:56,627 --> 00:07:58,527
<i>Getting there.
Marta's cheating on me.</i>

152
00:07:58,629 --> 00:08:00,859
- What?
- Yeah, can you believe that?

153
00:08:00,965 --> 00:08:05,664
That's crazy, Gob. She's not a cheater.
If she were to cheat, I'd like to think she'd cheat...

154
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:08,068
- You're the cheater.
- That's how I know all the signs.

155
00:08:08,172 --> 00:08:10,402
Last night she was all distant and weird.

156
00:08:10,508 --> 00:08:12,567
Wouldn't let me make love to her
on Mom's bed.

157
00:08:12,677 --> 00:08:16,135
I don't even want to tell you
what she wouldn't let me do to her in the car.

158
00:08:16,247 --> 00:08:19,375
And then today, I overhear her talking on
the phone about somebody all super silently.

159
00:08:19,483 --> 00:08:21,383
All in Spanish.

160
00:08:21,485 --> 00:08:24,648
<i>In fact, Marta was on the phone
with her mother talking about Michael.</i>

161
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,887
<i>Hermano.</i>

162
00:08:31,996 --> 00:08:35,488
She kept using this guy's name,
like, "Hermano."

163
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,331
Let me tell you something. We're gonna track
this "Hermano" down, and we're gonna nail him.

164
00:08:39,437 --> 00:08:41,997
'Cause if anyone's gonna go out with that girl,
it's gonna be one of us.

165
00:08:42,106 --> 00:08:45,667
- Right. Me.
- And I'm okay with that.

166
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:49,268
I don't get it.
Why do we have to change rooms?

167
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:52,372
Cousins of the opposite gender
shouldn't be sharing a room.

168
00:08:52,483 --> 00:08:56,044
But that's just the point. I mean, we're cousins.
Gender has nothing to do with it.

169
00:08:56,153 --> 00:08:59,020
I mean, cousins can bunk together.
That's why they call it "bunkin' cousins."

170
00:08:59,123 --> 00:09:02,524
- "Kissin' cousins."
- We're not kissing! That's the point!

171
00:09:02,627 --> 00:09:05,562
<i>George Michael was concerned
that Tobias had seen the candy heart...</i>

172
00:09:05,663 --> 00:09:09,121
<i>that said "Maybe Tonight"and had figured out
that he had a crush on his cousin.</i>

173
00:09:09,233 --> 00:09:12,464
Besides, I don't even care. You said share
a room with her, I shared a room with her.

174
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:15,733
Now you're saying don't share a room
with her. Fine. I'm just doing whatever you say.

175
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,071
You know, the adults making all the decisions
around here. Why am I in trouble?

176
00:09:19,176 --> 00:09:23,078
You're not in trouble. We're all just gonna have
a more normal arrangement.

177
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:27,549
I'm gonna sleep with my daughter,
and you're gonna sleep with my husband.

178
00:09:27,652 --> 00:09:30,985
<i>Buster had taken Michael's advice
and decided to confront his mother.</i>

179
00:09:34,225 --> 00:09:37,661
"Because you know I don't
appreciate how you treat me.

180
00:09:37,762 --> 00:09:39,662
I am not a child, Mother."

181
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,727
Blow.

182
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:48,566
No, Mother!
I can blow myself.

183
00:09:48,673 --> 00:09:50,800
And you have interfered
for the last time.

184
00:09:50,908 --> 00:09:55,242
Fine. Go! Move out.

185
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:06,755
<i>So, Buster loaded up his possessions...</i>

186
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:08,984
<i>and emancipated himself
from his mother.</i>

187
00:10:17,735 --> 00:10:20,203
Oh, hey, Buster.
I thought you had class.

188
00:10:20,304 --> 00:10:23,137
I thought you had class.
My brother-in-law fires you...

189
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,674
- and you move in on my girlfriend?
- Come on now. Wait a minute.

190
00:10:25,776 --> 00:10:29,644
This is purely a social call. You know,
just two adults gettin' a stew on, man.

191
00:10:29,747 --> 00:10:32,944
I don't know what that means,
but it sounds disgusting.

192
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,848
Hey, Buster.
Gee, I thought you had class.

193
00:10:35,953 --> 00:10:38,251
<i>I thought you had class!</i>

194
00:10:39,757 --> 00:10:41,657
I want to move in with you.

195
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:44,626
I'm tired of my mom
trying to control me.

196
00:10:44,729 --> 00:10:49,428
Wait a minute. Are you sure you're doing this
because you want to be with me...

197
00:10:49,533 --> 00:10:53,697
- and not because you want
to get even with your mother?
- This isn't about my mother.

198
00:10:53,804 --> 00:10:56,568
Besides, it's the only way
I'm ever gonna get her to respect me.

199
00:10:56,674 --> 00:11:00,474
Buster, this is exactly why
our relationship does not work.

200
00:11:00,578 --> 00:11:04,480
- Our relationship doesn't work?
- Not as long as you keep getting
me mixed up with your mother.

201
00:11:04,582 --> 00:11:06,777
It is exactly the opposite.

202
00:11:06,884 --> 00:11:09,148
<i>I'm leaving my mother for you.</i>

203
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:11,744
You're replacing my mother.

204
00:11:11,856 --> 00:11:13,824
You need some time.

205
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:15,824
Huh?

206
00:11:35,613 --> 00:11:39,174
<i>Meanwhile, Michael was
following Marta to confirm...</i>

207
00:11:39,283 --> 00:11:41,342
<i>Gob's suspicions about her affair.</i>

208
00:11:41,452 --> 00:11:44,512
<i>First, he saw her buy a present
at an exclusive men's store.</i>

209
00:11:44,622 --> 00:11:49,616
<i>The trail then led Michael to the set
of Marta's Spanish language soap opera.</i>

210
00:11:49,727 --> 00:11:51,957
Excuse me. I'm looking for "Hermano."

211
00:11:52,062 --> 00:11:54,189
<i>-? Mi hermano? Ahi.
- Mmm.</i>

212
00:11:54,298 --> 00:11:58,064
<i>- There, in the green? Great, thanks. Gracias.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

213
00:11:58,169 --> 00:12:01,969
"Hermano."

214
00:12:02,072 --> 00:12:03,972
<i>- Are you "Hermano"?
-? Mi hermano?</i>

215
00:12:04,074 --> 00:12:06,099
<i>Es ahi.</i>

216
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:08,906
- That's the guy who just...
- Mm-hmm.

217
00:12:11,215 --> 00:12:13,615
Son of a bitch.

218
00:12:17,021 --> 00:12:19,285
Hey.

219
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:25,887
Marta.

220
00:12:28,861 --> 00:12:31,227
<i>I had to see you.
He moved out.</i>

221
00:12:31,331 --> 00:12:33,458
Moved out? Buster did?

222
00:12:33,566 --> 00:12:36,501
- I know it's for his own good, but I'm worried.
- He's gonna be fine.

223
00:12:36,602 --> 00:12:39,332
I'm not worried about him.

224
00:12:39,439 --> 00:12:41,907
I've never lived
in the apartment alone.

225
00:12:42,008 --> 00:12:44,203
- I'm not sure I'm up to this.
- All right. Shh, shh, shh.

226
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:47,507
Listen. I know you think
I'm going after the $49...

227
00:12:47,613 --> 00:12:51,413
<i>but I want... I want you to watch
a little Caged Wisdom.</i>

228
00:12:51,517 --> 00:12:55,510
- Not this garbage again.
- There is joy in solitude, Lucille.

229
00:12:55,621 --> 00:12:59,751
Try being alone.
l-l-It just might make you happier.

230
00:12:59,859 --> 00:13:02,589
Honey, my happiest times here
are alone.

231
00:13:04,697 --> 00:13:09,157
Hey, Bruno, any chance that the hole
is available between 4:00 and 6:00?

232
00:13:09,268 --> 00:13:11,759
I don't even want to know
what that means.

233
00:13:11,871 --> 00:13:14,362
<i>With nowhere else to go,
Buster arrived at the model home.</i>

234
00:13:14,474 --> 00:13:17,170
- Buster Bluth.
- Hey, Brother-in-law.

235
00:13:17,276 --> 00:13:20,473
Good news.
Carl got me an audition.

236
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,811
- Carl Weathers?
- I think the world is about to fall in love...

237
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:26,976
with "Frightened Inmate #2."

238
00:13:27,086 --> 00:13:30,578
Well, at least he gave you something.
Carl Weathers took everything from me.

239
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:33,386
My entire life just came crashing down,
and it's all his fault.

240
00:13:33,493 --> 00:13:35,688
I will never love again.

241
00:13:35,795 --> 00:13:38,855
- Hello.
- Oh, my God.

242
00:13:38,965 --> 00:13:41,399
<i>- Is everything okay?
- And suddenly...</i>

243
00:13:41,501 --> 00:13:44,834
<i>Buster realized Marta was
the most beautiful woman he had ever seen.</i>

244
00:13:44,937 --> 00:13:46,837
I've been dating an old lady.

245
00:13:46,939 --> 00:13:48,804
Is Michael here?

246
00:13:48,908 --> 00:13:51,638
<i>- l-I don't... I don't know where he is.
- In fact...</i>

247
00:13:51,744 --> 00:13:54,235
<i>Michael was just returning
from his day of following Marta.</i>

248
00:13:54,347 --> 00:13:56,542
<i>Well, I lost her.</i>

249
00:13:56,649 --> 00:13:58,981
<i>- Michael.
- Marta.</i>

250
00:13:59,085 --> 00:14:01,849
- I'm so glad I caught you.
- You caught me?

251
00:14:01,954 --> 00:14:03,854
- Yes.
- Oh.

252
00:14:03,956 --> 00:14:06,481
First of all, thank you so much
for the lovely party...

253
00:14:06,592 --> 00:14:09,584
and for making me feel
so welcome in your family.

254
00:14:09,695 --> 00:14:12,095
- Yeah, sure.
- We love you!

255
00:14:13,766 --> 00:14:15,825
Can l... Can I stay here
for a little while?

256
00:14:15,935 --> 00:14:17,903
Everybody's already sharing
a bedroom but me, Buster.

257
00:14:18,004 --> 00:14:20,495
Oh, perfect.

258
00:14:20,606 --> 00:14:24,975
So, I was hoping you might
have some time to talk.

259
00:14:25,077 --> 00:14:27,409
There's something I need...

260
00:14:27,513 --> 00:14:30,004
- Maybe we could have dinner?
- Hello.

261
00:14:30,116 --> 00:14:34,052
She's at the house.
She's at the house!

262
00:14:34,153 --> 00:14:37,850
- One second.
- I'm gonna speak very carefully
in case she's with you.

263
00:14:37,957 --> 00:14:40,221
- You're right.
- Right about what? She's there?

264
00:14:40,326 --> 00:14:43,022
What's going on? Who's with you?
If it's Marta, say "nobody."

265
00:14:43,129 --> 00:14:45,154
- Nobody.
- Well, now I don't know what's going on.

266
00:14:45,264 --> 00:14:48,756
So, did you find out anything?
l-I'm dying here, Michael.

267
00:14:48,868 --> 00:14:51,359
- D-Did you find that guy? What's his name?
- "Hermano."

268
00:14:51,471 --> 00:14:53,530
- "Hermano."
- Is that your brother?

269
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:55,470
Hmm? No. He's upstairs, remember?

270
00:14:55,575 --> 00:14:58,703
Listen, I gotta go. Somebody wants
to take me out to dinner.

271
00:14:58,811 --> 00:15:00,904
- Somebody?
- Nobody.

272
00:15:01,013 --> 00:15:04,574
- Why don't I just come in? I'm right outside.
- No, no. Not... Not a good idea.

273
00:15:04,684 --> 00:15:07,278
Somebody wants to talk to me
about something.

274
00:15:07,386 --> 00:15:09,650
Ah, she wants
to talk to you. Got it.

275
00:15:09,755 --> 00:15:11,916
For some reason
women feel safe around you.

276
00:15:12,024 --> 00:15:13,924
Maybe because you've only
had sex four times.

277
00:15:14,026 --> 00:15:17,120
Four women! Not four times!
And they talk to me because I talk to them.

278
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:21,257
Look, go to dinner. Let's get to
the bottom of this "Hermano" stuff, brother.

279
00:15:21,367 --> 00:15:23,767
- Yep. Great.
- Great.

280
00:15:25,705 --> 00:15:27,935
Hey, about dinner,
I'd love to.

281
00:15:30,343 --> 00:15:35,406
<i>Tobias arrived at his audition
for "Frightened Inmate #2."</i>

282
00:15:38,484 --> 00:15:42,716
<i>The competition frightened Tobias,
which he felt he could use in his performance.</i>

283
00:15:42,822 --> 00:15:45,052
<i>Unfortunately this made him
more confident...</i>

284
00:15:45,157 --> 00:15:47,819
<i>which frightened him again.</i>

285
00:15:47,927 --> 00:15:49,827
I'm ready.

286
00:15:49,929 --> 00:15:52,159
<i>That night, Maeby moved in to Lindsay's room.</i>

287
00:15:52,265 --> 00:15:55,598
Isn't this fun?
It's like a slumber party.

288
00:15:55,701 --> 00:15:57,965
Hmm.

289
00:15:59,205 --> 00:16:02,436
That's it! Tell me what's up
with you and Dad.

290
00:16:02,542 --> 00:16:04,567
Nothing. Nothing's wrong
with your father and me.

291
00:16:04,677 --> 00:16:07,544
We have a... a wonderful,
close relationship.

292
00:16:07,647 --> 00:16:09,774
Can I let you in
on a little secret?

293
00:16:09,882 --> 00:16:14,615
Hmm? Having him in the next room
makes me miss him all the more.

294
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,952
Mom, please. He's got a big-boy crush
on Action Jackson.

295
00:16:19,058 --> 00:16:21,390
I know. How can I compete with that?

296
00:16:21,494 --> 00:16:26,158
Okay. We're having
a little fight right now.

297
00:16:26,265 --> 00:16:28,995
But don't worry, darling. Okay?

298
00:16:29,101 --> 00:16:31,069
Mommy and Daddy
aren't going anywhere.

299
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:34,469
Okay. I'm gonna go
unpack my suitcase.

300
00:16:34,574 --> 00:16:37,372
No! We may have to bolt.

301
00:16:37,476 --> 00:16:39,967
<i>Tobias moved in to George Michael's room.</i>

302
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,639
Maeby and I were cool with each other.
And you must miss your wife.

303
00:16:42,748 --> 00:16:44,648
It's practically still
your anniversary.

304
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,218
Fourteen years of lies.

305
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,221
Yes, I'm the doctor.
The perfect husband.

306
00:16:50,323 --> 00:16:53,417
The big manly man.
The big strong daddy.

307
00:16:53,526 --> 00:16:56,518
Do you know the last time
that I made love to my wife?

308
00:16:56,629 --> 00:16:58,426
- No.
- I'll tell you when.

309
00:16:58,531 --> 00:17:00,897
- No, don't.
- See, nothing has ever been easy for us.

310
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,128
<i>I mean, the only reason she went out with me
was to piss offher boyfriend.</i>

311
00:17:04,236 --> 00:17:07,535
The only reason she ever married me
was to piss off her mother.

312
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,939
And then, of course, we couldn't conceive.
So there was that famous ordeal.

313
00:17:11,043 --> 00:17:14,774
Wh-What do you mean you couldn't
conceive? Was Maeby adopted?

314
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,008
What? Is she not really related to me?
Is she just some girl I know?

315
00:17:18,117 --> 00:17:21,780
Ah, it's Carl Weathers.
Yes, Carl Weathers.

316
00:17:22,888 --> 00:17:25,618
I did? That's... That's wonderful.

317
00:17:25,725 --> 00:17:27,886
<i>That's...</i>

318
00:17:27,994 --> 00:17:30,622
Huh! I booked it!
I booked the acting job!

319
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:35,064
Did you hear that, Lindsay? You could have been
sleeping with "Frightened Inmate #2."

320
00:17:38,237 --> 00:17:42,037
<i>And Lucille was experiencing
being alone for the first time.</i>

321
00:17:43,676 --> 00:17:46,668
<i>Unable to sleep,
she decided to watch TV.</i>

322
00:17:46,779 --> 00:17:49,873
You have got to learn to be alone.

323
00:17:49,982 --> 00:17:52,416
<i>Then she remembered
that with no one to disturb...</i>

324
00:17:52,518 --> 00:17:54,713
<i>she could turn up the volume
as loud as she wanted.</i>

325
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:59,120
<i>Caged Wisdom teaches you
that you have to find thejoy within yourself.</i>

326
00:18:01,894 --> 00:18:03,987
<i>And that's when Lucille realized...</i>

327
00:18:04,096 --> 00:18:07,293
<i>that shejust might like being alone after all.</i>

328
00:18:11,837 --> 00:18:15,398
<i>The next night,
Michael had dinner with Marta at her house...</i>

329
00:18:15,508 --> 00:18:18,636
<i>hoping to finally get
the answers he was looking for.</i>

330
00:18:18,744 --> 00:18:22,236
So, um, about Gob.
How's that goin'?

331
00:18:22,348 --> 00:18:25,010
Well, as you said...

332
00:18:25,117 --> 00:18:27,847
finding out who you really are,
it can be painful.

333
00:18:27,953 --> 00:18:30,786
- But you can't live a lie.
- No, I can't.

334
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:33,290
But some people find a way
to make that work.

335
00:18:33,392 --> 00:18:36,555
Yes, but sometimes
working at something...

336
00:18:36,662 --> 00:18:39,153
it's a way to not deal
with some other thing.

337
00:18:39,265 --> 00:18:43,258
But he who often suggests...

338
00:18:43,369 --> 00:18:45,269
uh, working on another thing...

339
00:18:45,371 --> 00:18:48,135
- which when the first thing is not...
- Will you excuse me for a moment?

340
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,800
Yes. Sure.

341
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:54,311
- What the hell is he talking about?
- What is she talking about?

342
00:18:54,413 --> 00:18:57,439
<i>- Can I have a piece of cake?
- And Michael saw an opportunity...</i>

343
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:00,883
<i>to get the information
he wasn't getting from Marta from her son.</i>

344
00:19:00,986 --> 00:19:03,784
I'll tell you what.
I got... I got a deal for you, partner.

345
00:19:05,124 --> 00:19:08,025
I'll give you what you want...

346
00:19:08,127 --> 00:19:10,118
if you give me what I want.

347
00:19:10,229 --> 00:19:14,791
Tell me everything
you know about... "Hermano."

348
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,630
<i>-? Hermano?
- Does your mother love "Hermano?"</i>

349
00:19:17,737 --> 00:19:20,171
<i>Si, mi hermano.</i>

350
00:19:20,272 --> 00:19:23,400
- He's here?
- Shh. He's sleeping.

351
00:19:25,244 --> 00:19:29,544
- Don't go in there.
- Why? Is there something
you don't want me to see?

352
00:19:29,648 --> 00:19:32,310
- What are you talking about?
- We can keep going around in circles...

353
00:19:32,418 --> 00:19:34,978
but maybe one of us should just come out
and say what it is we want to say.

354
00:19:35,087 --> 00:19:37,055
You're right.

355
00:19:37,156 --> 00:19:40,648
- It's not working with Gob.
- Why doesn't he know that?

356
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,819
You know you could have
just come out and told him...

357
00:19:42,928 --> 00:19:45,897
you know, instead of lying and sneaking
around, moving on to the next guy.

358
00:19:45,998 --> 00:19:49,764
I didn't think you were that kind of a person.
I thought you and I shared the same values.

359
00:19:49,869 --> 00:19:52,269
I thought you and I
could've been, uh...

360
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:58,276
No, forget it. Eh... I don't know
how I had you so wrong.

361
00:19:58,377 --> 00:20:00,902
You're right.

362
00:20:01,013 --> 00:20:03,379
I should have told him
before I invited you here.

363
00:20:05,818 --> 00:20:08,082
This can never be.

364
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:13,850
<i>Then he noticed the gift he had seen her buy.</i>

365
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,803
- What does "te amo" mean?
- I love you.

366
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:33,310
Hmm.

367
00:20:33,412 --> 00:20:35,937
And who's in there?

368
00:20:38,651 --> 00:20:40,551
<i>Mi hermano.</i>

369
00:20:41,654 --> 00:20:44,316
Brother.

370
00:20:44,423 --> 00:20:47,221
I've made a huge mistake.

371
00:20:47,993 --> 00:20:50,052
<i>On the next
Arrested Development.</i>

372
00:20:50,162 --> 00:20:52,596
<i>George Michael
begins an investigation.</i>

373
00:20:52,698 --> 00:20:55,667
So, you wanna go
to the movies? Ow!

374
00:20:55,768 --> 00:20:58,396
I'll let you know when I get back
from the lab.

375
00:20:58,504 --> 00:21:00,472
<i>Tobias faces his greatest
acting challenge.</i>

376
00:21:00,573 --> 00:21:02,768
There's a shower scene?
I have to be nude.

377
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:05,435
Well, you don't shower
with your clothes on, now, do ya?

378
00:21:06,846 --> 00:21:09,610
<i>And Buster rebounds
from Lucille 2.</i>

379
00:21:09,715 --> 00:21:12,741
<i>- Yo te quiero mucho.
- Yo te quiero mucho.</i>

380
00:21:12,852 --> 00:21:15,980
<i>Te amo, Marta.
Te amo.</i>
