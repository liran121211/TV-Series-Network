1
00:00:00,653 --> 00:00:04,054
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:04,157 --> 00:00:06,148
<i>and the one son who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:08,250
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:13,767 --> 00:00:15,428
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

5
00:00:18,638 --> 00:00:22,904
<i>Michael Bluth was fed up
with his mother's extravagant spending.</i>

6
00:00:23,009 --> 00:00:25,705
Hey, Mom. Remember we had that
conversation about trying to...

7
00:00:25,812 --> 00:00:27,677
cut back on things
that aren't necessities?

8
00:00:27,781 --> 00:00:30,579
- Like it was yesterday.
- It was this morning...

9
00:00:30,683 --> 00:00:33,311
and now I hear that you've hired
a crew for the yacht.

10
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,049
<i>- I'm selling that yacht.
- Michael, you haven't heard why I want it.</i>

11
00:00:37,157 --> 00:00:41,491
To throw the most lavish party this town
has ever seen for my birthday.

12
00:00:41,594 --> 00:00:44,859
I enjoy bicentennials as much as
the next guy, Mom, but we're not doing that.

13
00:00:44,964 --> 00:00:49,230
My neighbor Lucille Austero is
constantly throwing parties for herself.

14
00:00:49,335 --> 00:00:52,600
- She's having another one in a week.
- I'm not going to that.

15
00:00:52,705 --> 00:00:54,605
<i>Buster had been avoiding
Lucille Austero...</i>

16
00:00:54,707 --> 00:00:59,337
<i>since he accidentally flirted with her
while not wearing his glasses.</i>

17
00:00:59,446 --> 00:01:02,347
<i>And then accidentally bid on her
at a charity bachelorette auction.</i>

18
00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:05,509
- Ten thousand dollars!
- Buster.

19
00:01:05,618 --> 00:01:09,179
<i>And then accidentally entered
her apartment, thinking it was his mother's.</i>

20
00:01:09,289 --> 00:01:11,416
I need you right now.

21
00:01:11,524 --> 00:01:14,687
Fellas, take a powder.

22
00:01:14,794 --> 00:01:17,661
Oh, here comes the 10:15
conniption, right on time.

23
00:01:17,764 --> 00:01:21,222
Honest to God, Buster, it's like every little
thing makes you seize up in terror lately.

24
00:01:21,334 --> 00:01:24,030
I have no idea where you get that from.

25
00:01:24,137 --> 00:01:27,300
Get away from that stove.
You're going to light your hair on fire.

26
00:01:28,808 --> 00:01:31,208
He's weak.

27
00:01:31,311 --> 00:01:34,371
Speaking of weak, Mom,
what do you got in there, gold bars?

28
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:39,710
Protein bars for your father.
He's pumping up in prison.

29
00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:44,222
- No more parties. Okay, Mom?
- You're my third least-favorite child.

30
00:01:44,324 --> 00:01:46,622
I can live with that.

31
00:01:46,726 --> 00:01:50,662
<i>Michael came home to find
his mother's fourth least-favorite child.</i>

32
00:01:50,763 --> 00:01:53,926
- Heard you're selling the yacht.
- Yeah. I had a couple in there this morning.

33
00:01:54,033 --> 00:01:55,432
Yeah, I know.

34
00:01:59,639 --> 00:02:02,073
Well, they got the Asian right.

35
00:02:02,175 --> 00:02:06,475
"Hotties" might be a stretch.

36
00:02:06,579 --> 00:02:10,140
Well, let's start with the little one.

37
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,845
- You're not staying on the yacht, are you?
- What do you want me to do?

38
00:02:13,953 --> 00:02:17,582
- Live full-time with Marta?
- Or break up with her.

39
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:20,488
I'm sure there'd be somebody else
out there that would appreciate her.

40
00:02:20,593 --> 00:02:22,686
<i>In fact, Michael felt
that man was himself.</i>

41
00:02:22,795 --> 00:02:26,697
<i>He had become infatuated
with his brother's girlfriend...</i>

42
00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:29,632
<i>and was having difficulty
keeping his love a secret.</i>

43
00:02:29,736 --> 00:02:32,261
You have 48 hours to vacate the yacht.

44
00:02:32,372 --> 00:02:36,832
Guys, I've got a great idea.
I wanna throw Mom a party.

45
00:02:36,943 --> 00:02:39,776
Would you...
I just told Mom no more parties.

46
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:44,009
I know, Michael. That's why this is the perfect
opportunity to throw her a surprise party.

47
00:02:44,117 --> 00:02:46,449
- She'd never suspect it.
- Is this her suggestion?

48
00:02:46,553 --> 00:02:50,455
No. I just think it's important to
honor your parents.

49
00:02:50,557 --> 00:02:54,357
Why don't you start by visiting Dad in jail?
You've never even been there.

50
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:58,089
Michael, do you have any idea what
would happen if I were to visit prison?

51
00:02:58,198 --> 00:03:00,359
- Hmm.
- It would be pandemonium.

52
00:03:00,466 --> 00:03:02,457
- Mm-hmm.
- It'd just give Dad one more reason to think...

53
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:04,969
that I've got nothing
to offer but my looks.

54
00:03:05,071 --> 00:03:09,007
Yeah, I got some of that...
except he also didn't like my looks.

55
00:03:10,243 --> 00:03:13,041
Okay, Michael. I will go visit Dad...

56
00:03:13,146 --> 00:03:15,137
if you drive Mom to the restaurant
for the surprise party.

57
00:03:15,248 --> 00:03:18,046
I'll just pretend that
I'm taking her out that evening.

58
00:03:18,151 --> 00:03:21,348
- Come on. That would never happen.
- She can't drive herself.

59
00:03:21,454 --> 00:03:24,423
<i>- I mean, she's the world's worst driver.
- Lindsay was not exaggerating.</i>

60
00:03:24,524 --> 00:03:29,484
<i>Lucille had recently been featured on
Fox's World's Worst Drivers.</i>

61
00:03:31,097 --> 00:03:33,565
Yeah. I can't believe she got that
driver's license renewed.

62
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:36,863
She didn't. I dummied her up a new one.

63
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,699
Not my best work though.
She wanted to look 48.

64
00:03:38,805 --> 00:03:41,365
<i>I nearly airbrushed her into oblivion.</i>

65
00:03:41,474 --> 00:03:43,840
We ended up checking "Albino" on the form.

66
00:03:43,943 --> 00:03:46,434
Come on, Michael. Who knows how long
our parents are going to be around.

67
00:03:46,546 --> 00:03:49,845
I gotta tell ya. I was over at her
place today, and she looked a little frail.

68
00:03:49,949 --> 00:03:53,350
She was having trouble even lifting up
this bag of groceries.

69
00:03:53,453 --> 00:03:56,684
All right. We will do the surprise party.

70
00:03:56,789 --> 00:03:59,417
<i>For Gangy?</i>

71
00:03:59,525 --> 00:04:03,518
- Yeah, how did you know?
- She called and invited us.

72
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:07,623
- Okay, so it was her idea.
- We don't have to go, do we?

73
00:04:07,734 --> 00:04:11,693
Come on. This is a Bluth family celebration.
It's no place for children.

74
00:04:11,804 --> 00:04:16,741
<i>And Lindsay went to the prison
to visit her father for the first time.</i>

75
00:04:16,843 --> 00:04:19,368
<i>But didn't get the reception
she was expecting.</i>

76
00:04:21,247 --> 00:04:24,239
<i>I wanna thank you for coming here.
It took a lot of guts.</i>

77
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:28,753
The reason I'm here today is because
I felt that I needed to say something.

78
00:04:28,855 --> 00:04:31,221
- Oh, okay.
- My whole life...

79
00:04:31,324 --> 00:04:33,815
all you've ever praised me for is my looks.

80
00:04:33,926 --> 00:04:36,394
- Oh, no. Your looks...
- Yes, Dad.

81
00:04:36,496 --> 00:04:39,124
I mean, it's always been
Michael's got the brains...

82
00:04:39,232 --> 00:04:42,895
Gob's got the charm,
Buster's got the...

83
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:46,798
- High-fastening pants.
- Have you said that?

84
00:04:46,906 --> 00:04:48,840
No. I'm saying that now.

85
00:04:48,941 --> 00:04:52,069
So, anyway. Look, if you're wondering why
I haven't visited...

86
00:04:52,178 --> 00:04:55,511
maybe it's because I wanted to be thought
of as more than just a beautiful face.

87
00:04:55,615 --> 00:04:58,584
And a gorgeous head of hair.

88
00:05:00,853 --> 00:05:04,812
<i>Lindsay was surprised once
again that no heads were turned.</i>

89
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:10,820
I'm gonna go shopping.
I'll be back tomorrow.

90
00:05:12,699 --> 00:05:12,799
<i>George Michael was finally
moving beyond his crush on Maeby...</i>

91
00:05:12,799 --> 00:05:16,326
<i>George Michael was finally
moving beyond his crush on Maeby...</i>

92
00:05:16,436 --> 00:05:18,802
<i>and felt happy to have a cousin
he couldjust see a movie with.</i>

93
00:05:18,905 --> 00:05:24,104
<i>It was a love between two cousins
that the world thought was wrong.</i>

94
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:29,671
<i>But it was the world that was wrong.</i>

95
00:05:29,782 --> 00:05:32,148
- We have got to see this movie.
- Excuse me, kids?

96
00:05:32,251 --> 00:05:34,378
Can I see your I.D.'s?

97
00:05:38,558 --> 00:05:41,618
<i>And Michael was driving his
mother to her surprise party.</i>

98
00:05:41,728 --> 00:05:45,186
Where on earth are we going?

99
00:05:45,298 --> 00:05:48,267
Left at the next corner.

100
00:05:48,368 --> 00:05:50,302
- You know, Michael?
- Yeah?

101
00:05:50,403 --> 00:05:52,701
I'd be happy to drive if you want me to.

102
00:05:52,805 --> 00:05:56,070
It's better than sitting here
with Buster's stupid rock behind me.

103
00:05:56,209 --> 00:05:58,143
<i>Buster had recently
brought the rock home...</i>

104
00:05:58,244 --> 00:06:02,374
<i>from an archeological dig, but had yet
to find a way to get it out of the car.</i>

105
00:06:02,482 --> 00:06:05,178
Mom, you've already got
two strikes on your record.

106
00:06:05,284 --> 00:06:08,651
You strike one more person,
and it's technically a spree.

107
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:15,320
Are we going to the back?
Is this what I think it is?

108
00:06:15,428 --> 00:06:19,831
<i>- Surprise!
- And she was surprised...</i>

109
00:06:19,932 --> 00:06:24,995
<i>- that her family didn't show up.
- So this is what my children think of me.</i>

110
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:40,544
Where the... was everybody?

111
00:06:40,653 --> 00:06:43,383
- What are you talking about?
- Mom's party. Where were you guys?

112
00:06:44,457 --> 00:06:46,357
It's the first I've heard about it.

113
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:51,760
- What about you? Neiman's?
- Prison.

114
00:06:51,864 --> 00:06:56,358
Then Neiman's. But only because I'm going
back to prison, and they've seen me in this.

115
00:06:56,469 --> 00:07:00,599
Buster? You of all people.
Where were you, buddy?

116
00:07:00,706 --> 00:07:02,537
You barely even leave Mom's apartment.

117
00:07:02,642 --> 00:07:06,476
<i>In fact, Buster was worried
about running into Lucille 2.</i>

118
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:08,604
<i>So he never left his mother's apartment.</i>

119
00:07:08,714 --> 00:07:13,515
<i>Lucille 2 was also supposed to go, but
was waiting until she saw Buster emerge.</i>

120
00:07:17,924 --> 00:07:20,950
Tonight, Mother was humiliated.

121
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,858
And I wanna throw her another
surprise party... a real one.

122
00:07:23,963 --> 00:07:26,295
One where she's not the one
that's yelling "Surprise."

123
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:29,835
<i>- Mom yelled "Surprise"?
- Yeah. She went from giddy to devastated.</i>

124
00:07:29,936 --> 00:07:32,461
I mean, it would've been funny
if it wasn't so...

125
00:07:32,572 --> 00:07:34,836
Well, it was kind of funny.

126
00:07:34,941 --> 00:07:37,068
What frail act got you this time, Michael?

127
00:07:37,176 --> 00:07:41,613
She couldn't open a jar? What, did a clump
of her hair come out in your hands?

128
00:07:41,714 --> 00:07:44,410
No. It was something that she said at dinner.

129
00:07:44,517 --> 00:07:47,145
It's dry.

130
00:07:47,253 --> 00:07:49,813
You know, Mom,
I'm sorry you're upset. But, you know...

131
00:07:49,922 --> 00:07:53,915
if you were nicer, then maybe your kids
would take better care of you, you know?

132
00:07:54,026 --> 00:07:56,494
Or-Or wanna be with you more.

133
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,759
I've been a horrible mother.

134
00:08:02,869 --> 00:08:05,633
No, Mom. You're great.

135
00:08:05,738 --> 00:08:08,036
You've been a great mother.

136
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:11,439
- Well, you know she's been
a horrible mother, right?
- You don't have to tell me.

137
00:08:11,544 --> 00:08:15,036
But what was I gonna say?
All right? So, it's a party.

138
00:08:16,582 --> 00:08:18,948
I mean, if you're not
gonna do it for Mom, do it for me.

139
00:08:19,051 --> 00:08:21,781
Okay. But I think
a party's a little excessive.

140
00:08:23,556 --> 00:08:27,185
Um, is it okay if I do it for Mom
and not you?

141
00:08:27,293 --> 00:08:30,262
- Yeah.
- 'Cause I really like Mom.

142
00:08:30,363 --> 00:08:33,127
We know.

143
00:08:33,232 --> 00:08:35,598
<i>The next day, Buster decided
it was time to deal with...</i>

144
00:08:35,701 --> 00:08:38,169
<i>the situation with Lucille Austero.</i>

145
00:08:38,271 --> 00:08:40,899
I've already got a Lucille in my life.

146
00:08:42,975 --> 00:08:46,376
I understand. That's healthy.

147
00:08:46,479 --> 00:08:48,640
I didn't mean to lead you on.

148
00:08:48,748 --> 00:08:51,979
- Oh, Buster. I feel so foolish.
- No.

149
00:08:52,084 --> 00:08:56,544
Yes. I'm foolish
and I'm funny and I'm needy.

150
00:08:56,656 --> 00:08:58,851
- Am I needy?
- No.

151
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:02,257
Are you sure I'm not needy?
'Cause I feel needy sometimes.

152
00:09:02,361 --> 00:09:05,330
You know, we're probably
not that different, you and me.

153
00:09:05,431 --> 00:09:07,991
You and I. Is it "l" or is it "me"?

154
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:12,935
- Buster, it's us.
- Yes. It is us. Us.

155
00:09:26,185 --> 00:09:29,279
<i>Under the pretense of driving
his mother somewhere else...</i>

156
00:09:29,388 --> 00:09:31,549
<i>Michael, once again,
arrived at the restaurant.</i>

157
00:09:31,657 --> 00:09:34,217
Michael, did you do this again?

158
00:09:34,327 --> 00:09:38,195
<i>- Surprise!
- And once again, no one showed up.</i>

159
00:09:38,297 --> 00:09:40,197
<i>Get up.</i>

160
00:09:41,233 --> 00:09:44,896
I told you. They don't support me.

161
00:09:45,004 --> 00:09:47,302
I hate to tell you, Mom,
but they don't support me either.

162
00:09:47,406 --> 00:09:50,705
I sat down and I told them
this was important to me.

163
00:09:52,111 --> 00:09:57,413
- You did that for me?
- I let you drive, didn't I?

164
00:09:57,516 --> 00:10:00,974
Yes, you did, Michael, and I'm loving it.

165
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:04,545
You're a good son.
You always do things for others.

166
00:10:04,657 --> 00:10:06,887
You're the only one
holding this family together.

167
00:10:06,993 --> 00:10:09,553
And you see a lot more than
I give you credit for, Mom.

168
00:10:09,662 --> 00:10:13,120
You're not just concerned with yourself.
You care about the family.

169
00:10:14,367 --> 00:10:16,392
Hey. Is that Gob?

170
00:10:16,502 --> 00:10:20,063
<i>It's an idiot on a scooter
at night? It's gotta be Gob.</i>

171
00:10:20,172 --> 00:10:23,300
- Let's give him a scare.
- Hmm?

172
00:10:23,409 --> 00:10:27,072
- No, Mom. I don't think we should.
- A nice little scare.

173
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:32,617
Hey, big shot, too busy to
go to your mother's party?

174
00:10:32,718 --> 00:10:36,347
<i>Mom, that is not Gob. Mom! Mom!</i>

175
00:10:47,533 --> 00:10:51,162
You okay, sir?

176
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:54,671
Yeah. I guess.
How's my mom? She's so frail.

177
00:10:54,774 --> 00:10:58,733
I'm fine. I'm fine.
I was thrown clear.

178
00:10:58,844 --> 00:11:01,608
I only care about you.

179
00:11:07,419 --> 00:11:11,116
- How are you feeling?
- Actually, my head does not hurt at all.

180
00:11:11,223 --> 00:11:15,182
- What did you give me?
- Your mother asked me to pump you full of...

181
00:11:15,293 --> 00:11:19,127
- Children's aspirin.
- Okay.

182
00:11:19,231 --> 00:11:23,361
You know, it's funny.
I remember, um, leaving the restaurant.

183
00:11:23,468 --> 00:11:26,266
And then, uh, I was driving, I guess.

184
00:11:26,371 --> 00:11:28,532
l-I just... I cannot picture it.

185
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,267
That's pretty common, actually.

186
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:33,936
It's just short-term memory loss from
the bump on the back of your head.

187
00:11:34,046 --> 00:11:37,607
I can't believe I did this. My
insurance rates are gonna go through the roof.

188
00:11:37,716 --> 00:11:42,153
That's not what matters now.
Here, get comfortable. Scoot up.

189
00:11:42,254 --> 00:11:45,815
"Scoot"? Scooter.
Was there a scooter involved?

190
00:11:45,924 --> 00:11:49,860
Oh, dear.
I can't believe I did that.

191
00:11:49,961 --> 00:11:53,089
- I am so sorry. I'll get you some air.
- I hardly felt it.

192
00:11:53,198 --> 00:11:56,065
In fact, actually, uh,
I didn't feel it.

193
00:11:56,168 --> 00:11:59,604
What was that?

194
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,732
Buster, you remember
when we were kissing last night?

195
00:12:05,844 --> 00:12:10,144
It was a wild, wild ride.

196
00:12:10,248 --> 00:12:12,876
But is this something we can do?

197
00:12:12,984 --> 00:12:15,953
Is this something society will allow?

198
00:12:16,054 --> 00:12:18,545
I don't care what other people think.

199
00:12:18,657 --> 00:12:24,118
My God, for the first time in years
I felt like I was standing on solid ground.

200
00:12:24,229 --> 00:12:27,562
You know,
my panic attacks have decreased.

201
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:32,296
I feel confident. I'm feeling proud even.

202
00:12:32,404 --> 00:12:36,238
I mean, for the first time
in my life...

203
00:12:42,047 --> 00:12:44,072
I'll call Dr. Miller.

204
00:12:44,182 --> 00:12:47,310
Oh. Excuse me.

205
00:12:47,419 --> 00:12:51,879
Hello. Oh, my God.
I'm getting my gauze.

206
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:55,448
You know, I should call George Michael.
I'm worried about my son.

207
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,462
<i>I'm worried about my son. George Michael
will be fine with his aunt and uncle.</i>

208
00:12:59,564 --> 00:13:03,022
<i>I want you resting, not using the phone.</i>

209
00:13:03,135 --> 00:13:08,573
- Let me take care of you.
- You know, you really are more
generous than I can remember.

210
00:13:08,673 --> 00:13:11,642
But that's what a parent does, huh?
You put your kid first?

211
00:13:14,012 --> 00:13:16,572
Rest up, sweetie.
You gave me quite a scare.

212
00:13:18,683 --> 00:13:22,585
Scare. Did somebody say,
"Let's give him a sc..."

213
00:13:22,687 --> 00:13:27,647
What is the matter with me?
Clumsy Clara.

214
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:31,217
Totally cool. Didn't feel a thing.
You know, Mom, I'm crazy about this aspirin.

215
00:13:31,329 --> 00:13:34,423
I can't believe we give it to children.

216
00:13:34,533 --> 00:13:38,196
<i>Gob, meanwhile, was being
visited by Michael's son, George Michael.</i>

217
00:13:38,303 --> 00:13:40,362
<i>Michael? George Michael.</i>

218
00:13:40,472 --> 00:13:43,032
<i>- You've gotta go.
- Wait.</i>

219
00:13:43,141 --> 00:13:45,769
Uncle Gob, is this a bad time?

220
00:13:45,877 --> 00:13:49,176
No. Are you kidding? So, what's up?

221
00:13:49,281 --> 00:13:52,682
I, uh, need you to make
some fake I.D.'s for me and Maeby.

222
00:13:52,784 --> 00:13:55,582
- Like a passport?
- Yeah, yeah. That'd be great.

223
00:13:55,687 --> 00:13:59,714
Oh, and, uh, preferably French.
I like the way they think.

224
00:13:59,825 --> 00:14:03,659
Look, I don't want you thinking that your uncle
is some sleazy character from the docks.

225
00:14:03,762 --> 00:14:06,253
- Good morning.
- How are you?

226
00:14:08,033 --> 00:14:11,662
She's an Olympian... hopeful.

227
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:16,571
Swimming and some coaching.
Yes, I will make the I.D.'s for you.

228
00:14:16,675 --> 00:14:18,734
But we're gonna have to make this quick.
Your dad wants me out of here by noon.

229
00:14:18,844 --> 00:14:21,404
I wouldn't worry about him.
He's staying at Gangy's.

230
00:14:21,513 --> 00:14:23,572
Yeah, he got in a car accident on the way
back from her birthday party.

231
00:14:23,682 --> 00:14:26,150
- Man, I told him not to let her drive.
- No. It was him driving.

232
00:14:26,251 --> 00:14:29,982
She's taking good care of him too.
She won't even let him use the phone.

233
00:14:30,088 --> 00:14:34,422
<i>- So you're telling me that he can't go
anywhere and he's incommunicado?
- Right.</i>

234
00:14:34,526 --> 00:14:37,984
<i>That's when Gob decided to take
the yacht to South America for the summer.</i>

235
00:14:38,096 --> 00:14:41,497
I gotta alert this boat's crew.

236
00:14:42,601 --> 00:14:44,694
They'll be devastated.

237
00:14:46,404 --> 00:14:50,738
<i>Lindsay put on her new outfit
and returned to prison.</i>

238
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:02,309
<i>Back at Lucille's, Michael was still
piecing together the accident.</i>

239
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,218
- Hey, Buster.
- Hey, brother.

240
00:15:07,058 --> 00:15:09,618
- Dr. Miller?
- Yeah.

241
00:15:09,728 --> 00:15:14,188
I just jumped through a plate glass window
on a date.

242
00:15:14,299 --> 00:15:16,233
Oh. Well, women love to laugh.

243
00:15:16,334 --> 00:15:20,862
It was worth it to be away from
Mom's controlling grasp.

244
00:15:20,972 --> 00:15:25,238
<i>Buster, what's going on?
What happened to your head?</i>

245
00:15:25,343 --> 00:15:28,938
Nothing. Gob was just teaching me
how to hit it with a hammer.

246
00:15:29,047 --> 00:15:31,515
Gob was there.

247
00:15:31,616 --> 00:15:34,244
Gob was on his scooter.

248
00:15:34,352 --> 00:15:36,252
I think I wanted to hit Gob.

249
00:15:36,354 --> 00:15:41,087
Yes. That is exactly what happened.
You wanted to give Gob a scare.

250
00:15:41,192 --> 00:15:42,989
I don't know why.

251
00:15:45,764 --> 00:15:47,425
I think I do.

252
00:15:49,501 --> 00:15:51,469
Thanks, Mom.

253
00:15:54,939 --> 00:15:57,908
<i>George Sr. was once again
being visited by his daughter.</i>

254
00:15:58,009 --> 00:16:00,136
That's it. I don't want...
You can't... I don't...

255
00:16:00,244 --> 00:16:02,235
Please, you gotta stop coming here.

256
00:16:02,347 --> 00:16:04,281
It is obvious I'm not wearing a bra, right?

257
00:16:04,382 --> 00:16:09,684
I can't take this anymore. I, um...
Uh, I'm paying far too big a price for this.

258
00:16:09,787 --> 00:16:12,984
Well, what about me?
This is the third time I've come here.

259
00:16:13,091 --> 00:16:17,152
- I haven't even been remotely harassed.
- That is not what I'm paying for.

260
00:16:17,261 --> 00:16:20,355
Have I lost it?
Did I ever even have it?

261
00:16:20,465 --> 00:16:22,592
I'm paying thousands
of dollars in Krugerrands.

262
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,930
- What?
- Gold. Krugerrands.

263
00:16:25,036 --> 00:16:29,166
Your mother snuck 'em in here
stuffed in energy bar wrappers...

264
00:16:29,273 --> 00:16:33,209
to keep me from getting
strangled in the shower or worse.

265
00:16:33,311 --> 00:16:36,610
- Stabbed?
- In a way.

266
00:16:36,714 --> 00:16:39,842
I used them to pay off
the other guys.

267
00:16:39,951 --> 00:16:44,945
To stop them from hollering
obscenities at my... my little girl.

268
00:16:45,056 --> 00:16:49,459
But you keep coming back here, honey,
and I'm going broke.

269
00:16:51,162 --> 00:16:53,790
That's all I ever wanted from you, Daddy.

270
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,298
For you to spend money on me.

271
00:16:59,904 --> 00:17:02,065
<i>No touching!</i>

272
00:17:03,408 --> 00:17:06,036
Gob, I want you to
move back on to the yacht.

273
00:17:06,144 --> 00:17:09,272
The yacht? What makes you think
I'd want to now?

274
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,314
Well, I know that
you've been looking for...

275
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:12,815
What was that?

276
00:17:12,917 --> 00:17:14,885
I think that was on your end.

277
00:17:14,986 --> 00:17:18,353
The truth is, I can wait on selling the yacht.
It's just money, right?

278
00:17:18,456 --> 00:17:21,084
Wow. How hard did you hit
that steering wheel?

279
00:17:21,192 --> 00:17:24,320
- I actually hit the back of my head.
- The back of your head?

280
00:17:24,429 --> 00:17:28,126
Yeah. Gob, the accident
only happened because...

281
00:17:28,232 --> 00:17:30,700
I was trying to scare you.

282
00:17:30,802 --> 00:17:33,862
- Maybe even hurt you.
- That doesn't sound like you.

283
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:35,871
It sounds like Mom.

284
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:38,703
Can we please just lay
off Mom for a change?

285
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:42,405
She's the one that helped me remember
what happened. I'm the bad guy here. Not her.

286
00:17:42,513 --> 00:17:47,382
And definitely not you,
so, would you please just take the yacht?

287
00:17:47,485 --> 00:17:50,045
I'll think about it.

288
00:17:51,956 --> 00:17:55,414
South America sounds good.

289
00:17:55,526 --> 00:17:58,825
But a chance to expose Mom?

290
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:03,230
- Turn this skiff around.
- We haven't even left the dock.

291
00:18:04,869 --> 00:18:07,099
But "skiff" is appropriate, right?

292
00:18:07,238 --> 00:18:10,901
<i>Gob rushed to shore
to spare his brother...</i>

293
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:13,135
<i>from what he was certain
were his mother's machinations.</i>

294
00:18:13,244 --> 00:18:16,213
<i>- What are you doing?
- Hey. Open this door.</i>

295
00:18:16,314 --> 00:18:18,282
<i>- You've been set up.
- Michael!</i>

296
00:18:18,382 --> 00:18:21,180
There's no way you were trying to hurt me.
You don't hate me.

297
00:18:21,285 --> 00:18:23,879
Mom hates me.
You kind of like me.

298
00:18:23,988 --> 00:18:25,615
- Yeah. I kind of like you.
- Yeah.

299
00:18:25,723 --> 00:18:28,556
<i>- Michael, I need your help.
- Coming.</i>

300
00:18:28,659 --> 00:18:31,594
- Ow! I got hit back there.
- Right!

301
00:18:31,696 --> 00:18:34,995
On the back of the head, which means that
you couldn't have hit the steering wheel.

302
00:18:35,099 --> 00:18:38,068
Mom must have clubbed you with a
champagne bottle or something so she could drive.

303
00:18:38,169 --> 00:18:40,831
- Gob, how'd you figure it out?
- It's funny you should ask that...

304
00:18:40,938 --> 00:18:43,236
No. He didn't figure anything out.

305
00:18:43,341 --> 00:18:46,435
I probably got hit on the back of the head
because of Buster's rock.

306
00:18:46,544 --> 00:18:49,513
Hey, big shot!

307
00:18:50,848 --> 00:18:52,975
Which was behind the passenger seat.

308
00:18:53,084 --> 00:18:57,248
Which means that she picked you up
and dragged you over to the driver's seat.

309
00:18:57,355 --> 00:19:00,756
Mom can't pick me up. She could barely
pick up that bag of protein bars.

310
00:19:02,193 --> 00:19:03,922
<i>Guess what? They weren't protein bars.</i>

311
00:19:04,028 --> 00:19:08,488
They were gold Krugerrands.
And Dad finally paid attention to my intellect.

312
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:10,260
- Open this door!
- Gob, this is nuts.

313
00:19:10,368 --> 00:19:12,996
Mother is frail.

314
00:19:13,104 --> 00:19:15,766
- Stop this nonsense this instant!
- You set him up, Mom.

315
00:19:15,873 --> 00:19:19,172
I was halfway to South America,
but I couldn't let you get away with it...

316
00:19:19,277 --> 00:19:22,735
because we're brothers, Mom,
and we kind of like each other.

317
00:19:24,949 --> 00:19:28,385
- You were going to South America?
- I don't think so.

318
00:19:30,888 --> 00:19:33,686
Mom, you and I were getting along so well.
I was thinking so highly of you.

319
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:36,385
How could you make me think
this was all my fault?

320
00:19:36,494 --> 00:19:38,792
Because if you knew it was my fault,
you would've turned against me.

321
00:19:38,896 --> 00:19:43,230
And I had finally gotten you on my side.
You were sticking up for me.

322
00:19:43,334 --> 00:19:45,564
l-I don't even remember
you ever doing that before.

323
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:48,366
I just want my children to love me.

324
00:19:48,472 --> 00:19:52,636
<i>Stop lying. Stop manipulating.
Just be nicer.</i>

325
00:19:52,743 --> 00:19:54,802
But...

326
00:20:01,953 --> 00:20:03,921
You're right.

327
00:20:09,327 --> 00:20:12,387
I'm a horrible mother.

328
00:20:14,966 --> 00:20:18,697
- No, no, Mom. You're great.
- That's crazy talk.

329
00:20:18,803 --> 00:20:21,203
- You're a fantastic mother.
- I can't believe what I'm hearing, Mother.

330
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:23,500
Oh, we do. We really love you.

331
00:20:23,608 --> 00:20:25,576
<i>On the next
Arrested Development.</i>

332
00:20:25,676 --> 00:20:29,806
<i>George Michael and Maeby sneak back
into Les Cousins Dangereux.</i>

333
00:20:29,914 --> 00:20:32,678
Excuse me. You're too young to be
holding that ticket.

334
00:20:32,783 --> 00:20:34,444
- Let's go.
- I can't go to jail.

335
00:20:34,552 --> 00:20:37,680
<i>- Let's just watch cartoons.
- Sir, we will not be starting with Les Cousins...</i>

336
00:20:37,788 --> 00:20:41,417
- until you leave.
- Excuse me, but I thought my A.A.R.P. card...

337
00:20:41,525 --> 00:20:44,983
- was good for one and a guest.
- You know what?
I knew society would never accept this.

338
00:20:45,096 --> 00:20:50,056
<i>And they never will.
- Michael's
insurance takes another hit.</i>

339
00:20:53,504 --> 00:20:57,634
Ow!

340
00:20:57,742 --> 00:21:00,438
I was definitely driving that time.
