1
00:00:01,171 --> 00:00:04,572
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:04,674 --> 00:00:06,665
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:06,776 --> 00:00:08,767
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:14,284 --> 00:00:15,945
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

5
00:00:19,556 --> 00:00:22,457
Another setback for the once
prominent Bluth family...

6
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:24,459
<i>as their frozen banana stand...</i>

7
00:00:24,561 --> 00:00:26,859
<i>a Newport Beach landmark
burns to the ground.</i>

8
00:00:26,963 --> 00:00:30,421
<i>A delicious whodunit after this.</i>

9
00:00:31,968 --> 00:00:33,526
<i>A week before the fire...</i>

10
00:00:33,636 --> 00:00:36,969
<i>Michael Bluth was trying
to save the Bluth Company...</i>

11
00:00:37,073 --> 00:00:40,474
<i>- but his father was making it difficult.
- I need the flight records, Dad.</i>

12
00:00:40,577 --> 00:00:42,704
I'm trying to find some money
for the family.

13
00:00:42,812 --> 00:00:45,713
There's always money in the banana stand.

14
00:00:45,815 --> 00:00:48,045
I am having a love affair with this ice
cream sandwich. Want some?

15
00:00:48,151 --> 00:00:50,051
- You wanna take a bite? Take a bite.
- Please. Please.

16
00:00:50,153 --> 00:00:52,644
- Come on. Take a bite. Bite.
- The S.E.C. has locked up our funds.

17
00:00:52,755 --> 00:00:56,054
- These guys aren't messing around.
- No touching!

18
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:58,992
So I need you to tell me.
Were you taking vacations in the jet?

19
00:00:59,095 --> 00:01:01,154
Is that what you're hiding from me?

20
00:01:01,264 --> 00:01:04,791
I haven't had a vacation in years.
This is my vacation.

21
00:01:04,901 --> 00:01:07,301
I'm exercising.
I'm sleeping well.

22
00:01:07,403 --> 00:01:12,102
- You're doing time.
- I'm doing the time of my life!

23
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:15,405
- What's up, pumpkin?
- Hey. T-Bone!

24
00:01:15,512 --> 00:01:17,412
- What's up?
- Yeah. T-Bone's my roommate.

25
00:01:17,514 --> 00:01:19,573
- Oh.
- He's a flamer.

26
00:01:19,682 --> 00:01:23,482
<i>- T's checking out today.
- Yeah.</i>

27
00:01:23,586 --> 00:01:25,918
Well, I guess every vacation's
gotta come to an end.

28
00:01:30,026 --> 00:01:32,426
You just made a fool out of yourself
in front ofT-Bone.

29
00:01:32,529 --> 00:01:36,260
Anyway, I want you to give him
a job at the company. Sales.

30
00:01:36,366 --> 00:01:38,266
- I'm not gonna do that.
- Why not?

31
00:01:38,368 --> 00:01:40,268
- Because we don't have any money.
- Because he's a flamer?

32
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:43,999
- I told you that in confidence.
- You don't seem to understand
I'm running this company now...

33
00:01:44,107 --> 00:01:46,871
and I need the flight records,
and I'm gonna get them...

34
00:01:46,976 --> 00:01:49,444
- with or without your help.
- All right.

35
00:01:49,546 --> 00:01:53,107
<i>No touching!</i>

36
00:01:53,216 --> 00:01:55,707
I got something we can try, all right?
It's a little risky.

37
00:01:55,818 --> 00:01:58,150
- Please.
- Open up.

38
00:01:58,254 --> 00:02:00,620
What do you mean about...

39
00:02:01,991 --> 00:02:05,017
<i>While George Sr. was losing a roommate...</i>

40
00:02:05,128 --> 00:02:08,188
<i>George Michael was having
a hard time adjusting to his new one.</i>

41
00:02:08,298 --> 00:02:10,198
Get up. Get up.
Get up. Get up.

42
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,961
<i>- Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up.
- I'm up!</i>

43
00:02:12,068 --> 00:02:14,969
Okay, we are just about
ass to ankles back here, Maeby.

44
00:02:15,071 --> 00:02:18,063
Do you wanna hop on
your cousin's lap there, please?

45
00:02:19,576 --> 00:02:21,635
<i>Whoa, bumpy road ahead.</i>

46
00:02:27,016 --> 00:02:29,416
<i>So, he addressed his problem head-on.</i>

47
00:02:30,687 --> 00:02:32,484
Dad, I wanna work more hours
at the banana stand.

48
00:02:32,589 --> 00:02:36,525
Wow. Huh.
Well, that's great.

49
00:02:36,626 --> 00:02:39,186
You know, I used to be
just like you when I was a kid.

50
00:02:39,295 --> 00:02:43,755
<i>I used to love it there.
- It's gonna be
our best summer ever, Mikey!</i>

51
00:02:45,635 --> 00:02:48,195
Well, I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna give you a promotion.

52
00:02:48,304 --> 00:02:50,329
Welcome aboard, Mr. Manager.

53
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,533
Wow! I'm Mr. Manager!

54
00:02:52,642 --> 00:02:54,667
Well, manager.
We just say "manager."

55
00:02:54,777 --> 00:02:57,940
<i>And you can hire an employee
if you need one.</i>

56
00:02:58,047 --> 00:03:01,175
- Do you think I need one?
- Don't look at me, Mr. Manager.

57
00:03:01,284 --> 00:03:04,879
Right. It's up to me now.
I'm Mr. Manager.

58
00:03:04,988 --> 00:03:08,082
- Manager. We just say...
- I know, but you just...

59
00:03:08,191 --> 00:03:10,182
It doesn't matter who.

60
00:03:17,233 --> 00:03:19,292
I don't know what I expected.

61
00:03:19,402 --> 00:03:23,896
What's going on? This is exactly where the two
of you were when I left this morning.

62
00:03:24,007 --> 00:03:27,704
- Is nobody gonna even try to get a job?
- I have a job, Michael.

63
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:32,213
- It's called supporting my husband.
- You haven't been shopping.

64
00:03:32,315 --> 00:03:34,783
The only thing I found in the freezer
was a dead dove in a bag.

65
00:03:34,884 --> 00:03:38,581
<i>You didn't eat that, did you? 'Cause I've
only got a couple days left to return it.</i>

66
00:03:38,688 --> 00:03:41,748
<i>Died right in the middle
of a show.</i>

67
00:03:41,858 --> 00:03:45,487
- Do you want a cage for that?
- No. I'm a magician.

68
00:03:51,401 --> 00:03:54,302
What is your return policy,
by the way?

69
00:03:54,404 --> 00:03:58,101
<i>Not that I have to defend myself, but
for your information, I did go shopping.</i>

70
00:03:58,207 --> 00:04:00,573
You spent $68
on hair conditioner?

71
00:04:00,677 --> 00:04:03,544
A small price to pay
for self-esteem, Michael.

72
00:04:03,646 --> 00:04:07,582
Or are you still jealous that you lost Best Hair
to me in high school and got Dorkiest?

73
00:04:07,684 --> 00:04:09,777
<i>Lindsay's achievements in high school...</i>

74
00:04:09,886 --> 00:04:13,322
<i>had always overshadowed Michael's.</i>

75
00:04:13,423 --> 00:04:16,415
I agree with Michael. It's important
not to tie your self-esteem...

76
00:04:16,526 --> 00:04:19,120
into how you look or
what people think of you.

77
00:04:19,228 --> 00:04:21,321
I mean, look at me.
I'm an actor.

78
00:04:21,431 --> 00:04:24,093
An actor,
for crying out loud!

79
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,795
You know how much rejection
I face every day?

80
00:04:27,904 --> 00:04:30,566
But in this business of show...

81
00:04:30,673 --> 00:04:33,164
you have to have the heart
of an angel...

82
00:04:33,276 --> 00:04:36,211
and the hide of an elephant.

83
00:04:36,312 --> 00:04:38,439
But you've never actually
had an audition.

84
00:04:40,717 --> 00:04:42,617
Well...

85
00:04:42,719 --> 00:04:46,155
excuse me!

86
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:52,087
Excuse me.

87
00:04:52,195 --> 00:04:54,993
<i>Some really great spousal support.
You know something, Lindsay?</i>

88
00:04:55,098 --> 00:04:57,862
You might wanna start thinking about the
example you're setting for your daughter...

89
00:04:57,967 --> 00:04:59,992
unless you want her
to end up just like you.

90
00:05:00,103 --> 00:05:02,503
Yeah. Shoot me
when that happens.

91
00:05:02,605 --> 00:05:05,870
Is there a carbon monoxide leak
in this house?

92
00:05:08,644 --> 00:05:11,169
<i>George Michael, you're taking
your cousin to work today.</i>

93
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,011
That's your new employee. I do not want my niece
to end up just like everyone in this family.

94
00:05:15,118 --> 00:05:17,746
Uh-uh. You're not telling my daughter
what to do. She's a child!

95
00:05:17,854 --> 00:05:20,880
No, I'm not. I can work.

96
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:25,154
I don't know about this. I mean,
it can get pretty hairy in there.

97
00:05:25,261 --> 00:05:27,161
Fine. Do what you want.

98
00:05:27,263 --> 00:05:29,823
If I know my daughter,
that stand won't be there in a week.

99
00:05:32,001 --> 00:05:33,992
You stay on top of her, buddy.

100
00:05:34,103 --> 00:05:38,062
Do not be afraid
to ride her. Hard.

101
00:05:42,178 --> 00:05:44,908
<i>George Michael's attempt
to distance himself...</i>

102
00:05:45,014 --> 00:05:47,949
<i>from his cousin proved unsuccessful.</i>

103
00:05:53,689 --> 00:05:56,089
I can't tell you how many health codes
you're violating right now.

104
00:05:56,192 --> 00:05:58,183
I can't believe
I volunteered for this.

105
00:05:58,294 --> 00:06:01,593
This is my stupidest
rebellion ever.

106
00:06:01,697 --> 00:06:04,530
Hey, do you wanna
go play Skee-Ball?

107
00:06:04,634 --> 00:06:07,432
Wait... This is the cash drawer.

108
00:06:07,537 --> 00:06:09,437
My dad's gonna come by
at the end of the weekend...

109
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:12,201
and the number of bananas has to match
the amount of money in here.

110
00:06:12,308 --> 00:06:14,868
- Oh, so it all has to even out?
- Exactly.

111
00:06:14,977 --> 00:06:18,469
Easy. Banana.

112
00:06:18,549 --> 00:06:20,574
Buck.

113
00:06:20,684 --> 00:06:23,278
Banana. Take a buck.

114
00:06:23,387 --> 00:06:25,912
<i>And Michael went to his mother
for the flight records...</i>

115
00:06:26,023 --> 00:06:28,321
<i>his father wouldn't give him.</i>

116
00:06:28,426 --> 00:06:32,453
<i>Then why don't you marry
an ice cream sandwich?</i>

117
00:06:32,563 --> 00:06:34,861
- I gotta go.
- Who was that? Was that Dad?

118
00:06:34,965 --> 00:06:38,025
- That was Gob.
- Uh-huh.

119
00:06:38,135 --> 00:06:40,399
- So, Mom, I'm trying to find...
- I don't know where they are.

120
00:06:40,504 --> 00:06:43,064
these flight records.

121
00:06:43,174 --> 00:06:45,199
You know, it's really more
believable if you let me finish.

122
00:06:45,309 --> 00:06:48,301
<i>Why am I the only one that seems to
get how much trouble this family is in?</i>

123
00:06:48,412 --> 00:06:51,142
Oh, I get it, Michael.
I get it.

124
00:06:51,248 --> 00:06:54,706
But how should I know where the records
are kept? Your father's in charge of all that.

125
00:06:54,819 --> 00:06:56,810
No, I'm in charge of all of that.

126
00:06:56,921 --> 00:06:59,287
And I think that you do know
where they are.

127
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,620
Oh, it's probably all in
a storage unit somewhere.

128
00:07:01,725 --> 00:07:03,625
Where is the storage unit?

129
00:07:03,727 --> 00:07:05,627
- I don't remember.
- Try.

130
00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:09,563
Something with "Dale."
I don't know. Brookfeather.

131
00:07:09,667 --> 00:07:11,965
<i>Raintree. It's hot.
It's very hot there.</i>

132
00:07:12,069 --> 00:07:14,594
- I've never been. Get a warrant!
- Don't think I won't.

133
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,635
Mother... Mother, I care
about this family.

134
00:07:18,742 --> 00:07:21,609
And I do, too, my darling.

135
00:07:21,712 --> 00:07:24,738
That's why I'm worried about Gob. I was
on the phone with him this morning.

136
00:07:24,849 --> 00:07:28,808
You mean just now, right?
When I came in?

137
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:33,015
Yes, just now, when you came in.
And he's upset. He's very upset.

138
00:07:33,123 --> 00:07:35,921
You haven't included him in the business at all.

139
00:07:36,026 --> 00:07:38,859
He's your older brother.
You could find a little job for him.

140
00:07:38,963 --> 00:07:42,262
- Make him feel special.
- But he's not special, Mother.

141
00:07:42,366 --> 00:07:44,891
No.

142
00:07:45,002 --> 00:07:48,267
But he loves you.
We all love you.

143
00:07:48,372 --> 00:07:51,739
- Where's the storage unit?
- It's with your warrant.

144
00:07:53,444 --> 00:07:55,935
Luz, that coat cost
more than your house!

145
00:07:57,715 --> 00:08:00,946
Oh, that's how we joke.
She doesn't even have a house.

146
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,346
<i>The next day, Tobias looked for work.</i>

147
00:08:06,457 --> 00:08:08,220
<i>Hmm. Actor Pull.</i>

148
00:08:13,063 --> 00:08:15,463
Ooh.

149
00:08:17,334 --> 00:08:19,632
Oh, look at all these parts!

150
00:08:23,107 --> 00:08:25,598
Tobias, nice to see you off the couch.

151
00:08:25,709 --> 00:08:29,475
<i>I was looking for work, and I blew it, Michael.</i>

152
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,105
I guess you've already
seen that, huh?

153
00:08:32,216 --> 00:08:35,708
Yes, I have.
Oh, right. This one.

154
00:08:35,819 --> 00:08:38,344
Yeah, I'll call them again,
I guess.

155
00:08:38,455 --> 00:08:40,753
I'll give them one more shot.

156
00:08:40,858 --> 00:08:43,088
<i>And that's when Michael
figured out how to get his mother...</i>

157
00:08:43,193 --> 00:08:47,152
<i>to lead him to the storage unit
where the flight records were kept.</i>

158
00:08:49,533 --> 00:08:52,024
- Hello.
- Hey, Mom, it's Michael. Listen.

159
00:08:52,136 --> 00:08:54,161
<i>Before I forget,
I talked to the I.R. S...</i>

160
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:56,239
and they wanna come by
your apartment today...

161
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,002
to see if you charged any
big-ticket stuff to the company.

162
00:08:59,109 --> 00:09:02,567
Furs or...

163
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,511
I don't know.
just a heads-up.

164
00:09:06,617 --> 00:09:09,609
Oh, that poor woman.

165
00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:14,756
<i>So Michael followed Luz...</i>

166
00:09:14,858 --> 00:09:16,792
<i>who had been sent
to hide the evidence.</i>

167
00:09:16,894 --> 00:09:20,330
<i>Meanwhile, Tobias had arranged
an audition for a local commercial.</i>

168
00:09:20,431 --> 00:09:22,399
<i>Lindsay came along
to appear supportive.</i>

169
00:09:22,499 --> 00:09:26,560
- This could take a while.
- Honey, it's one line.

170
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,695
Not if I do my job right.

171
00:09:28,806 --> 00:09:32,902
First of all, I love it.
Quick question though.

172
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:37,879
Am I panicked about the fire,
or am I being brave for everyone else?

173
00:09:37,982 --> 00:09:41,213
The fire...
It's... It's a fire sale.

174
00:09:44,021 --> 00:09:46,489
Oh. Oh.

175
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,490
Okay, I didn't, um...

176
00:09:48,592 --> 00:09:50,651
<i>Well, let's give it a shot.</i>

177
00:09:52,796 --> 00:09:56,789
Oh, my God!
We're having a fire... sale.

178
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:00,358
Oh, the burning!
It burns me!

179
00:10:00,471 --> 00:10:03,736
<i>Evacuate all the schoolchildren!</i>

180
00:10:03,841 --> 00:10:08,778
?? This isn't a fever!

181
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:10,642
I can't even see
where the knob is!

182
00:10:19,189 --> 00:10:21,089
And scene.

183
00:10:21,191 --> 00:10:24,354
Um...

184
00:10:24,461 --> 00:10:27,191
Would you like to try that
a little simpler maybe?

185
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,630
No.

186
00:10:34,071 --> 00:10:36,505
Okay. Anybody else?
Anyone?

187
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:39,775
Lindsay Bluth?

188
00:10:39,877 --> 00:10:41,777
- It's Fünke.
- Roger Danish.

189
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:44,074
Look at you.
I can't believe it's Lindsay Bluth.

190
00:10:44,181 --> 00:10:45,648
- Oh!
- Fünke.

191
00:10:45,749 --> 00:10:48,479
Roger was my male counterpart
in high school.

192
00:10:49,953 --> 00:10:52,183
Remember how crazy
our hair was back then?

193
00:10:52,289 --> 00:10:55,224
What were we thinking?
So what are you doing now?

194
00:10:55,325 --> 00:10:57,520
- He's, uh, casting my commercial.
- Oh...

195
00:10:57,628 --> 00:11:00,859
Yeah, trying to. The South Coast
Boutique is having a fire sale.

196
00:11:00,964 --> 00:11:04,525
South Coast Boutique?
They're having a fire sale?

197
00:11:09,239 --> 00:11:13,539
<i>Meanwhile, Michael was
still following his mother's housekeeper.</i>

198
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:22,647
<i>And she did finally
lead him to the storage unit.</i>

199
00:11:22,753 --> 00:11:25,984
<i>Unfortunately, it was on fire.</i>

200
00:11:31,028 --> 00:11:33,553
Somebody wanted this place to go.

201
00:11:33,664 --> 00:11:38,328
- Yeah? What do you mean, arson?
- Oh, definitely the work of a flamer.

202
00:11:59,723 --> 00:12:02,954
It shoots tomorrow,
and are you ready for this?

203
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:07,758
- It pays 1,000 bucks!
- Mmm. I thought that was Tobias's part.

204
00:12:07,864 --> 00:12:10,162
Yes. No. No,
I did not book this one.

205
00:12:10,267 --> 00:12:13,998
I, uh... I think I made the,
uh, fire too real, uh, for them...

206
00:12:14,104 --> 00:12:17,073
and, uh... and probably failed
to highlight the sale.

207
00:12:17,173 --> 00:12:21,576
<i>So, good for her.
And, uh, will you excuse me, please?</i>

208
00:12:24,481 --> 00:12:26,608
Well, that's great,
but I've got my own problems.

209
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:28,942
The flight records?
They burned up.

210
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:32,816
That's fine. That's over with.
But I think Dad is behind it.

211
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,048
I think Dad is trying
to run the business from prison.

212
00:12:36,157 --> 00:12:39,320
<i>Well, isn't that ironic?
I'm making a fortune at my newjob...</i>

213
00:12:39,427 --> 00:12:41,759
and you don't even have
the job you thought you did.

214
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:45,525
But you don't have a job. You've got a
job offer. Anybody can get a job offer.

215
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,862
So, I'm gonna go see Dad,
because this is my business to run now.

216
00:12:52,974 --> 00:12:55,340
Your business?

217
00:12:57,612 --> 00:12:59,842
Hey, there you are, Gob.

218
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:02,211
I have been looking all over for you.

219
00:13:02,316 --> 00:13:04,716
I could really use some help.

220
00:13:04,819 --> 00:13:08,721
Well, I was gonna return this dove.

221
00:13:08,823 --> 00:13:11,621
What are you... You want me to run
a meeting for you or something?

222
00:13:11,726 --> 00:13:14,661
Or, even better,
could you mail this letter for me?

223
00:13:14,762 --> 00:13:17,458
You can't just give that
to a mailman?

224
00:13:17,565 --> 00:13:21,057
I can't trust a mailman with this.
This is important.

225
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:23,636
<i>Gob was intrigued.
He also suspected...</i>

226
00:13:23,738 --> 00:13:26,536
<i>he couldn't return a completely
frozen dove to a pet store...</i>

227
00:13:26,641 --> 00:13:29,508
<i>and get the full refund
he felt he was entitled to.</i>

228
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:33,307
<i>I'll mail that letter.
- Michael then went
to confront his father.</i>

229
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:37,713
You are not going to keep
running the company from in here, okay?

230
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:39,479
That's why you wanted me
to give T-Bone a job?

231
00:13:39,587 --> 00:13:43,523
- To pay him back
for burning down the storage unit?
- Michael, that's ridiculous.

232
00:13:43,624 --> 00:13:46,650
Well, I'm not hiring him. No.
We don't have the money, Pop.

233
00:13:46,761 --> 00:13:49,321
There's always money in the banana stand.

234
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:54,163
The banana stand! You know, that's
exactly what this feels like. Huh?

235
00:13:54,268 --> 00:13:57,328
Like I'm still stuck in that hot booth
all summer with you pulling the strings.

236
00:13:57,438 --> 00:14:00,339
What was I gonna do, put a kid in charge
of a frozen banana stand?

237
00:14:00,441 --> 00:14:02,932
Sure. That's what I did.
I just made my son the manager.

238
00:14:04,545 --> 00:14:07,446
George Michael is running
the frozen banana stand now?

239
00:14:07,548 --> 00:14:12,212
That's right. Yeah. You sit with that.
You think about that for a while.

240
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:14,685
<i>George Sr. did think about that.</i>

241
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:21,685
Well, now that we've got an employee,
we can go have dinner.

242
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:28,264
We throw away a banana for every buck
we take so no one finds out.

243
00:14:28,369 --> 00:14:30,769
Wait a minute.
I think you should do that math again.

244
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:33,738
- Why? Is it wrong?
- It's fine.

245
00:14:33,841 --> 00:14:37,299
He's an arsonist, not an embezzler.

246
00:14:37,411 --> 00:14:40,574
<i>Meanwhile, Michael got
an urgent call from his mother.</i>

247
00:14:40,681 --> 00:14:42,876
Gob is unhappy.

248
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:45,543
Again? I tried to include him.
I gave him a job.

249
00:14:45,653 --> 00:14:49,145
- You gave him a letter to mail.
- Don't tell me that was too much for him.

250
00:14:49,256 --> 00:14:52,453
No, Michael, he mailed the letter.
That's not the point.

251
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,791
<i>Gob had not mailed the letter,
but, in an act of defiance...</i>

252
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:58,262
<i>dramatically hurled the letter
into the sea.</i>

253
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:04,769
<i>This proved a more difficult dramatic
gesture than he'd anticipated.</i>

254
00:15:17,218 --> 00:15:19,778
- So what do you want me to do about it?
- Don't take that tone.

255
00:15:19,887 --> 00:15:24,290
He's my son.
I want you to make him stop calling me.

256
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:26,916
<i>Am I the only one
who works in this family?</i>

257
00:15:27,027 --> 00:15:29,894
<i>Yes, that's my gal.</i>

258
00:15:29,997 --> 00:15:33,398
Who would have imagined... two actors
in one family?

259
00:15:33,501 --> 00:15:35,935
We're like the Lunts!

260
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:41,770
- You see... Excuse me.
- Mama.

261
00:15:41,876 --> 00:15:45,607
<i>And so, Lindsay and Maeby
separately went to the same restaurant...</i>

262
00:15:45,713 --> 00:15:48,443
<i>to celebrate thejobs
they hadn't actually performed...</i>

263
00:15:48,549 --> 00:15:51,040
<i>with money they
hadn't actually earned.</i>

264
00:15:51,152 --> 00:15:54,121
Did you enjoy your meal, Mom?
You drank it fast enough.

265
00:15:54,221 --> 00:15:56,689
<i>- Hi, Lucille!
- Not as much as you enjoyed yours.</i>

266
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,725
You want your belt to buckle,
not your chair.

267
00:15:58,826 --> 00:16:01,852
Okay, this is what I
told Tobias you'd do.

268
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:04,692
Say what you will about him.
At least he's happy for me.

269
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,632
You know, I think we might
be doubling our losses here.

270
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:16,471
Because, I mean, for every dollar you
take, you're actually taking two dollars...

271
00:16:16,577 --> 00:16:18,977
because we paid for the bananas.

272
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:21,206
Oh, my God, you're right.

273
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:26,378
I am? Oh, God, I've screwed this up!
Okay, we gotta go.

274
00:16:26,487 --> 00:16:31,652
<i>- Oh, my God! It's your mom and Gangy.
- What are they doing here?</i>

275
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,659
They're grown-ups. They're allowed
to have fun whenever they want.

276
00:16:33,761 --> 00:16:36,696
We're kids. We're supposed to be working.
Now they're gonna tell my dad...

277
00:16:36,797 --> 00:16:39,129
and he's gonna come check the totals
and know we took the money.

278
00:16:39,233 --> 00:16:41,394
- Oh, God, this is bad. What are we gonna do?
- Look.

279
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:45,063
Pop-pop, he's a business man.
What would he do?

280
00:16:46,207 --> 00:16:48,175
Bananas Foster.

281
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,377
You might wanna let that fire go out
before you stick your face in it.

282
00:16:56,483 --> 00:16:58,747
That's funny, 'cause I was gonna say,
"You might wanna lean away from that fire...

283
00:16:58,853 --> 00:17:01,515
since you're soaked in alcohol."

284
00:17:01,622 --> 00:17:03,691
Mine was better.

285
00:17:03,691 --> 00:17:04,350
Mine was better.

286
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,358
Welcome to Bluth Bananas,
where bananas are our business.

287
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,360
May I interest you
in a banana this day?

288
00:17:08,462 --> 00:17:12,694
- T-Bone, what are you doing here?
- Your dad gave me this job.

289
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,236
<i>Michael realized that his father
had even taken control...</i>

290
00:17:16,337 --> 00:17:18,362
<i>of the banana stand.</i>

291
00:17:18,472 --> 00:17:20,372
<i>But he still had some
unanswered questions...</i>

292
00:17:20,474 --> 00:17:22,271
<i>so he did
a little detective work.</i>

293
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:24,276
- You burn down the storage unit?
- Oh, most definitely.

294
00:17:29,283 --> 00:17:32,548
Michael, having a nice day
at the beach...

295
00:17:32,653 --> 00:17:35,713
while the rest of us are busting
our asses to deliver your mail?

296
00:17:35,823 --> 00:17:39,156
What do you want me to say?
You go and complain to Mom...

297
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,421
- and I tried to include you.
- Include me?

298
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:44,053
- Yeah.
- I should be in charge. I'm the older brother.

299
00:17:44,164 --> 00:17:48,726
- Please, do you even wanna be in charge?
- No! But I'd like to be asked.

300
00:17:48,836 --> 00:17:51,168
This is just like when we were kids,
and you were the only one...

301
00:17:51,272 --> 00:17:54,298
- he let work in the banana stand.
- Well, I got news for you.

302
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:57,571
Dad still doesn't trust me to this day.
He treats me like a low-level employee.

303
00:17:57,678 --> 00:18:00,772
Better than being treated
like the goofball...

304
00:18:00,881 --> 00:18:03,577
the joker, the magician.

305
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:07,986
I thought you were gonna do,
like, a trick there.

306
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:09,988
- A fireball or something.
- I was. It didn't go off.

307
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,990
These things never go off when you want them to.

308
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:14,424
- My least consistent trick.
- Hang on one sec. Hello.

309
00:18:14,528 --> 00:18:17,520
- Hey, Uncle Michael, it's me, Maeby.
- Where's George Michael?

310
00:18:17,631 --> 00:18:22,261
At the banana stand. He's about to do
something really irresponsible.

311
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:25,133
<i>You think it's irresponsible?
I'll be right there.</i>

312
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,905
<i>- I'm gonna get blamed for this.
- George Michael.</i>

313
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:32,035
- Dad.
- Hey, what are you doing?

314
00:18:32,146 --> 00:18:36,776
I was just, uh...
I was burning down the banana stand.

315
00:18:36,884 --> 00:18:39,614
- What?
- I'm sorry. I screwed it all up.

316
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,620
I've got no right to
call myself Mr. Manager.

317
00:18:41,722 --> 00:18:43,553
- Manager.
- Manager. I'm sorry, Dad.

318
00:18:43,657 --> 00:18:46,717
- Oh, George Michael.
- I am. But I'll make it up to you.

319
00:18:46,827 --> 00:18:48,556
I'll work weeknights.
I'll lay people off.

320
00:18:48,662 --> 00:18:50,459
I'll give up my summer,
all my summers.

321
00:18:50,564 --> 00:18:52,532
just just tell me what to do,
and I'll do it.

322
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:57,127
<i>Michael realized he had done
to his son what his father had done to him...</i>

323
00:18:57,237 --> 00:18:59,637
<i>so he came up with a solution.</i>

324
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:02,675
- Burn it down.
- What?

325
00:19:02,776 --> 00:19:05,609
Let's burn this son of a bitch.

326
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:17,647
This is gonna be
our best summer ever, buddy.

327
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:26,522
<i>And so, Michael, his son
and his brother together enjoyed...</i>

328
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:28,931
<i>the cathartic burning
of the banana stand.</i>

329
00:19:29,036 --> 00:19:32,233
You mailed that
insurance check, right, Gob?

330
00:19:47,254 --> 00:19:49,484
<i>The next morning,
Lindsay woke up late in the day...</i>

331
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,785
<i>hungover from celebrating
her one day of employment...</i>

332
00:19:51,892 --> 00:19:54,554
<i>which, it turns out,
she had slept through.</i>

333
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:57,255
All right, Lindsay, forget it.
We'll get someone else.

334
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:59,525
<i>Tobias was next on the call list...</i>

335
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:01,533
<i>but, unfortunately, couldn't hear the phone...</i>

336
00:20:01,635 --> 00:20:05,230
<i>over the sound of the shower.</i>

337
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:07,068
<i>He did, however,
use Lindsay's conditioner...</i>

338
00:20:07,174 --> 00:20:10,439
- and was surprised to find that
it did help his self-esteem.
- Mornin'.

339
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:13,069
- You look nice.
- What?

340
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,080
You look
very handsome today.

341
00:20:15,182 --> 00:20:17,047
Thank you, Lindsay.

342
00:20:19,186 --> 00:20:21,950
<i>And Michael finally got to show
his father who's boss.</i>

343
00:20:22,056 --> 00:20:24,820
- You what?
- Burned it right down to the ground.

344
00:20:24,925 --> 00:20:28,383
Are you crazy?
There was money in that banana stand.

345
00:20:28,495 --> 00:20:31,464
Well, it's all gone now, Dad,
and it was my decision.

346
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:33,624
So the next time you wanna have
a little power struggle...

347
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:36,066
just remember that
you're playing with fire.

348
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:40,573
There was $250,000 lining the walls
of the banana stand.

349
00:20:40,674 --> 00:20:43,837
- What?
- Cash, Michael.

350
00:20:43,944 --> 00:20:46,742
- Why didn't you tell me that?
- How much clearer can I say...

351
00:20:46,847 --> 00:20:50,783
"There's always money
in the banana stand"?

352
00:20:50,884 --> 00:20:52,784
- No touching! No touching!
- No touching!

353
00:20:52,886 --> 00:20:55,252
<i>- No touching! No touching!
- No touching!</i>

354
00:20:55,355 --> 00:20:57,755
<i>On the next
Arrested Development.</i>

355
00:20:57,858 --> 00:21:01,658
<i>Gob protests the pet store's
frozen dove exchange policy.</i>

356
00:21:01,762 --> 00:21:04,322
Return from whence you came!

357
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:06,490
<i>And, Michael, realizing
the banana stand...</i>

358
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,933
<i>is the only profitable part
of the Bluth empire, decides to rebuild.</i>

359
00:21:10,037 --> 00:21:13,598
You couldn't have called me?
I can't swing a hammer?

360
00:21:15,109 --> 00:21:18,772
I got a rabbit to buy.
