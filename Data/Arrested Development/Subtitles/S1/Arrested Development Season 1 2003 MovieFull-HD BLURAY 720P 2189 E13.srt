1
00:00:01,653 --> 00:00:04,554
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:04,656 --> 00:00:06,647
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:06,758 --> 00:00:08,749
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:14,266 --> 00:00:15,927
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

5
00:00:18,737 --> 00:00:22,503
<i>Michael Bluth was
infatuated with his brother's girlfriend, Marta...</i>

6
00:00:22,607 --> 00:00:25,041
<i>a Spanish-language
soap opera star.</i>

7
00:00:25,143 --> 00:00:29,671
<i>But when he found out she was interested
in a man named Hermano, he confronted her.</i>

8
00:00:29,781 --> 00:00:32,682
<i>Unfortunately, he discovered too late...</i>

9
00:00:32,784 --> 00:00:35,582
<i>that "hermano"
in Spanish meant "brother,"</i>

10
00:00:35,687 --> 00:00:40,556
<i>and the person Marta was infatuated with
was, in fact, himself.</i>

11
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:46,120
<i>This was distracting Michael the next day when
he went to meet his father's attorney at prison.</i>

12
00:00:46,231 --> 00:00:48,631
Look, there is nothing to it.
It's an arraignment.

13
00:00:48,733 --> 00:00:53,363
They announce the charges.
However, it would help if you all showed up...

14
00:00:53,471 --> 00:00:55,803
Iooking like a loving,
supportive family.

15
00:00:55,907 --> 00:00:58,034
- For how long?
- Ten minutes, tops.

16
00:00:58,143 --> 00:01:01,044
See if you can
get it down to five.

17
00:01:01,146 --> 00:01:04,582
<i>You know, maybe I should confess
these crimes, save everybody the trouble.</i>

18
00:01:04,683 --> 00:01:09,211
Oh, get off the mount. You're coming home,
guilty or somehow found not guilty.

19
00:01:09,321 --> 00:01:11,846
Hello?

20
00:01:11,957 --> 00:01:15,950
<i>What the hell is going on? I'm waiting to
hear about Marta and this Hermano guy.</i>

21
00:01:16,061 --> 00:01:18,552
Yeah, I checked it out.
I do not think that she's cheating.

22
00:01:18,663 --> 00:01:22,326
- I'm going over to Marta's.
- No, no, no. Don't do that, okay?

23
00:01:22,434 --> 00:01:24,561
just lay low, be cool
and I'll talk to her again.

24
00:01:24,669 --> 00:01:27,763
<i>- That way you won't look so desperate, you know?
- You're a good guy, mon frère.</i>

25
00:01:27,872 --> 00:01:29,840
That means "brother" in French.

26
00:01:29,941 --> 00:01:33,308
I don't know why I know that.
I took four years of Spanish.

27
00:01:33,411 --> 00:01:35,606
<i>So Michael went to speak with Marta...</i>

28
00:01:35,714 --> 00:01:38,683
<i>about the misunderstanding
from the night before.</i>

29
00:01:38,783 --> 00:01:41,616
- I owe you an apology.
- No, I owe you an apology.

30
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,349
I'm so ashamed that
I was so disrespectful to your brother.

31
00:01:45,457 --> 00:01:47,857
Oh, who cares?
Nobody respects him.

32
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:51,588
You see, Marta, I have been interested
in you since the first day that we met.

33
00:01:51,696 --> 00:01:55,097
- Really?
- Yeah. Yeah.

34
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,498
It doesn't matter.

35
00:01:57,602 --> 00:02:01,129
We live by a code, you and l...
to honor family.

36
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:05,903
Yes. That's one of the things that attracted
me to you... your sense of right and wrong.

37
00:02:06,011 --> 00:02:08,275
I also like your hair
and your face and your breasts.

38
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,848
- You're so unlike your brother.
- Oh, thank you.

39
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:15,283
- Gob is like the cock of the walk. But not you.
- You are so kind.

40
00:02:15,387 --> 00:02:18,948
- You're sensitive, like a woman.
- That's enough.

41
00:02:19,057 --> 00:02:21,287
We do have to do
the right thing.

42
00:02:21,393 --> 00:02:25,693
- And being together is the wrong thing.
- Very, very...

43
00:02:25,797 --> 00:02:27,697
wrong.

44
00:02:48,086 --> 00:02:51,055
- Is that Gob?
- He likes to make love to this.

45
00:02:51,156 --> 00:02:54,523
- I'm gonna turn this off.
- Please.

46
00:02:55,994 --> 00:02:58,792
Oh!

47
00:02:58,897 --> 00:03:02,765
- Gob's wand.
- Oh, this... this is so wrong.

48
00:03:02,867 --> 00:03:06,667
- Yes.
- No, no, no. Not-Not-Not... Not... Not hot wrong.

49
00:03:06,771 --> 00:03:11,902
- You know, regular wrong. I gotta tell Gob.
- No, I have to tell him.

50
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:16,037
Yes, but you speak a little slowly, and I
really want to get this thing moving along.

51
00:03:16,147 --> 00:03:19,344
So, listen, you do the noble thing, and you
tell him that you've met somebody else.

52
00:03:19,451 --> 00:03:22,511
I'm gonna do the noble thing
and tell him that it's me.

53
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,680
While I'm doing my noble thing you could put
those photos in a box, get rid of the wand...

54
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:28,725
and we can do the wrong thing
the right way.

55
00:03:28,827 --> 00:03:31,796
<i>And Maeby was getting tired
ofher parents'constant fighting.</i>

56
00:03:31,896 --> 00:03:35,195
<i>I'm saying every time something
starts to go well for you, you blow it.</i>

57
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,734
<i>Nothing has ever gone well for me,
and you know that!</i>

58
00:03:37,836 --> 00:03:41,431
That's my point,
you handsome cowboy, you.

59
00:03:41,539 --> 00:03:47,375
<i>Oh, great. And now you're mocking me,
you selfish, country-music-loving lady.</i>

60
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:49,379
Hello, Maeby.

61
00:03:49,481 --> 00:03:52,712
Nice cover. Why don't you two just get
a divorce and save us all a lot of grief?

62
00:03:52,817 --> 00:03:57,277
<i>The night before, Tobias and Lindsay
had chosen to sleep in separate rooms...</i>

63
00:03:57,388 --> 00:04:00,755
<i>and Tobias had dropped
an intriguing bit of information.</i>

64
00:04:00,859 --> 00:04:03,828
And then, of course, we couldn't conceive,
so there was that famous ordeal.

65
00:04:03,928 --> 00:04:06,590
What do you mean, you couldn't conceive?
Was Maeby adopted?

66
00:04:06,698 --> 00:04:09,758
Is she not really related to me?
Is she just some girl I know?

67
00:04:09,868 --> 00:04:12,564
<i>George Michael never got an answer.
- It's Carl Weathers.</i>

68
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:15,468
<i>So he set about doing some
investigating on his own.</i>

69
00:04:15,573 --> 00:04:19,009
- Hey, have you ever seen any
pictures of your mom pregnant?
- Don't talk to me about my mom.

70
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,271
She's crazy.
Both of them are.

71
00:04:21,379 --> 00:04:24,405
<i>- Sometimes I wish we weren't even related.
- Hey, you know, maybe we're not.</i>

72
00:04:24,516 --> 00:04:27,076
Because, I mean, when you think about it,
we don't even really look like each other.

73
00:04:27,185 --> 00:04:29,915
No, I was talking
about my parents.

74
00:04:30,021 --> 00:04:32,455
God, what's wrong
with this family?

75
00:04:33,658 --> 00:04:36,218
Maybe we're not a family.

76
00:04:36,327 --> 00:04:39,592
And maybe that's
very, very right. We...

77
00:04:39,697 --> 00:04:44,396
Uncle Gob.
Hey, uh, was Aunt Lindsay ever pregnant?

78
00:04:44,502 --> 00:04:49,269
Oh, yeah. Dozens of times.
Hey, is your dad around, or...

79
00:04:52,477 --> 00:04:55,969
- Hey, Gob. Marta call?
- She sure has...

80
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,878
<i>four times,
but I didn't take the calls.</i>

81
00:04:58,983 --> 00:05:01,042
Oh, no? Why not?

82
00:05:01,152 --> 00:05:05,680
- Because of you. You said to lay low.
And it's working.
- Great.

83
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:09,453
Tell you what, you may not be good with women,
but you are great with other people's women.

84
00:05:09,561 --> 00:05:12,621
I'll give you that.
- No! Listen, Gob,
you can't just ignore her.

85
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:15,130
<i>Maybe you should talk to her.
She is your girlfriend.</i>

86
00:05:15,233 --> 00:05:17,793
Exactly. And I want
to keep it that way.

87
00:05:17,902 --> 00:05:22,532
<i>For all I know, she's calling to break up with me.
I don't answer the phone, that doesn't happen.</i>

88
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:27,475
<i>And it's all because of you, fratello.
That's Italian for brother.</i>

89
00:05:27,579 --> 00:05:30,309
Now all I gotta do
is find this Hermano guy.

90
00:05:30,415 --> 00:05:32,815
<i>- I'm gonna kill him.
- Hey, Brother.</i>

91
00:05:32,917 --> 00:05:34,316
<i>- Hey, Busty.
- Hey, Brother.</i>

92
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:36,683
- Hey, Buster.
- Gob, there's no need for violence.

93
00:05:36,788 --> 00:05:41,157
<i>There never is. I'd like to think
that we're all intelligent, mature...</i>

94
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:43,921
adults that can settle
their differences...

95
00:05:44,028 --> 00:05:46,895
whenever they might come to light,
through words.

96
00:05:46,998 --> 00:05:49,228
Yeah, well, I let my fists
do the talking.

97
00:05:49,334 --> 00:05:51,962
Not this one, 'cause obviously,
I need it for coin tricks and stuff.

98
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:55,164
<i>- But this one, I let it speak for both of them.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

99
00:05:55,273 --> 00:05:58,970
Mom always taught us to curl up in a ball
and remain motionless when confronted.

100
00:05:59,077 --> 00:06:01,409
That's what I did in high school
when I almost got into a fight.

101
00:06:01,512 --> 00:06:05,004
- I think that was about being attacked by bears.
- Yeah, I know.

102
00:06:06,517 --> 00:06:08,985
Hey, rich kid.
Gimme your lunch money.

103
00:06:11,489 --> 00:06:15,516
But sometimes I wonder what it would be like
to get into a fight today.

104
00:06:15,627 --> 00:06:19,620
- You'd be a much bigger ball.
- There is so much in life
that I have not experienced.

105
00:06:19,731 --> 00:06:23,223
And now that I'm away from Mom,
I feel like this is my chance to live.

106
00:06:23,334 --> 00:06:27,430
I want to dance. I want to make love
to a woman. I want to get a checking account.

107
00:06:27,538 --> 00:06:30,473
I want to know what
it feels like to get my face socked in.

108
00:06:30,575 --> 00:06:33,043
Michael, don't get that! That could be Marta!

109
00:06:33,144 --> 00:06:36,375
What? Oop! Too late. Hello?

110
00:06:36,481 --> 00:06:38,745
- Michael?
- Oh, hi, Mom.

111
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:42,081
- I'm not here.
- Is that Buster? Tell him I'm fine without him.

112
00:06:42,186 --> 00:06:45,587
Why haven't you called me back?
I'm worried about your father's hearing.

113
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:48,158
Mom, listen, it's gonna be fine.
I'm on it, okay? I'm taking care of it.

114
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:52,059
- I'll be there first thing Friday morning.
- It's tomorrow at 4:30.

115
00:06:52,163 --> 00:06:56,099
- Oh. I should write that down.
- Where is your head, Michael?

116
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,430
Everything's gonna be fine.
They just read the charges...

117
00:06:58,536 --> 00:07:00,766
and we look like a loving family for,
like, six minutes.

118
00:07:00,872 --> 00:07:03,807
- Ten minutes.
- We couldn't get that down, huh?

119
00:07:03,908 --> 00:07:07,105
<i>George Michael, meanwhile,
went to speak with Tobias.</i>

120
00:07:07,211 --> 00:07:10,009
- This was just faxed to you.
- Oh, great! The rewrite.

121
00:07:10,114 --> 00:07:12,241
Let's see if they've
beefed up my part.

122
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:14,580
I got three lines!

123
00:07:14,686 --> 00:07:19,419
So, uh, I've been thinking about that, uh... that
conversation we were having the other night...

124
00:07:19,524 --> 00:07:22,015
about, uh, where Maeby
came from, and, uh...

125
00:07:22,126 --> 00:07:24,788
I was just wondering if
you could finish that thought.

126
00:07:24,896 --> 00:07:27,421
Yes, okay.
Uh, well, have a seat.

127
00:07:28,533 --> 00:07:30,433
Uh...

128
00:07:31,769 --> 00:07:33,737
Um...

129
00:07:35,239 --> 00:07:37,833
When a man...

130
00:07:37,942 --> 00:07:43,471
needs to prove to a woman
that he's actually...

131
00:07:43,581 --> 00:07:45,674
When a man loves a woman...

132
00:07:45,783 --> 00:07:50,152
and he actually wants
to make love, uh, to her...

133
00:07:50,254 --> 00:07:53,451
something very,
very special happens.

134
00:07:53,558 --> 00:07:56,891
And, uh, with deep,
deep concentration...

135
00:07:56,995 --> 00:08:01,329
- and-and great focus,
he's often able to achieve an erec...
- I'm sorry.

136
00:08:01,432 --> 00:08:03,798
I'm gonna stop you.
I know where you're running.

137
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:06,165
l-I didn't mean
babies in general.

138
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:12,004
Oh, well, that's good,
'cause it was about to get a little, ick, gross.

139
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:15,705
- Yeah. No, I meant specifically with Maeby.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

140
00:08:15,813 --> 00:08:17,713
- This isn't right.
- I know. You're right.

141
00:08:17,815 --> 00:08:20,010
- I'm sorry.
- No, no. It says it's a shower scene.

142
00:08:20,118 --> 00:08:23,610
I'm not supposed to be in a shower scene.
It has nudity.

143
00:08:23,721 --> 00:08:27,680
<i>Tobias was a never-nude,
which is exactly what it sounds like.</i>

144
00:08:27,792 --> 00:08:31,626
I don't do nudity.
It says that right on my résumé. Okay?

145
00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:34,220
What... What do you think
I wear these for?

146
00:08:34,332 --> 00:08:36,732
I was never actually
clear on that.

147
00:08:36,834 --> 00:08:39,860
So, you're, uh...
you're not with Marta anymore?

148
00:08:39,971 --> 00:08:44,601
Well, my plan is to get her wanting me
but bad, and then I spring it on her.

149
00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:48,338
I know you've been cheating on me,
and you just cost yourself one fine man...

150
00:08:48,446 --> 00:08:53,110
- and one fine CD of him singing
"Love is in the Air."
- Well, I would never, uh...

151
00:08:53,217 --> 00:08:56,311
do this while you were
still going out, but, uh...

152
00:08:56,421 --> 00:08:59,686
if you're done with her,
I'd sure like a crack at her.

153
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:02,885
Right, right.
That sounds great. Go for it, buddy.

154
00:09:02,994 --> 00:09:05,929
But you know that she's kind of
used to being with me, right?

155
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:10,091
So, it'd be sort of like
going from prime rib to...

156
00:09:10,201 --> 00:09:13,534
I don't know...
weird brother of prime rib.

157
00:09:13,638 --> 00:09:16,607
- Do you even know her?
- I met her. I fell for her.

158
00:09:16,707 --> 00:09:22,373
<i>I've been watching her program, El Amor
Prohibido... The Love That Is Forbidden.</i>

159
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,744
<i>She is the love that's forbidden.</i>

160
00:09:24,849 --> 00:09:27,147
<i>The love of my hermano.</i>

161
00:09:27,251 --> 00:09:29,981
Wait a second. What?
You know Hermano?

162
00:09:30,088 --> 00:09:35,253
<i>"Hermano" is brother in Spanish.
As in, "Hey, hermano."</i>

163
00:09:35,359 --> 00:09:37,827
- Huh.
- Brother?

164
00:09:37,929 --> 00:09:40,921
<i>- Hermano means brother?
- Yeah.</i>

165
00:09:41,032 --> 00:09:45,560
<i>Well, sounds like hermano
is about to get his ass kicked.</i>

166
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:48,468
Well, this is what I said I wanted.

167
00:09:48,573 --> 00:09:54,068
So, all right. Let's get it over with. Huh!

168
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:00,250
Uh, so, are you gonna hit me?

169
00:10:00,352 --> 00:10:04,550
No, I'm not gonna hit you. You're not
the brother Marta's cheating on me with.

170
00:10:04,657 --> 00:10:08,252
- Oh. Oh, who is?
- How the hell should I know, Buster?

171
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,228
You know, there is a guy who plays
her older brother on her show.

172
00:10:12,331 --> 00:10:14,629
I think his name is Tio.

173
00:10:14,733 --> 00:10:16,724
Tio.

174
00:10:16,836 --> 00:10:20,795
Well, sounds like someone who you
think's name is Tio...

175
00:10:20,906 --> 00:10:23,374
is about to get his ass kicked.

176
00:10:23,476 --> 00:10:26,741
Thanks for the tip, Buster.

177
00:10:26,846 --> 00:10:30,805
All right, Mom. I'll be sure to tell Buster.
Right. Bye. Mom wanted me to tell you...

178
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:33,476
that she doesn't care whether you live or die,
but if you're not dead...

179
00:10:33,586 --> 00:10:35,747
she would like to see you at the courthouse
tomorrow in the blue sweater.

180
00:10:35,855 --> 00:10:38,915
- Damn! I hate the blue sweater.
- She said it would look nice with the gray pants.

181
00:10:39,024 --> 00:10:41,492
- Damn it! She's right!
- Where's Gob?

182
00:10:41,594 --> 00:10:45,428
- I think he's heading down to the set
of Marta's soap opera.
- What?

183
00:10:45,531 --> 00:10:48,523
She may be cheating on him
with the guy who plays her brother.

184
00:10:48,634 --> 00:10:51,159
I mean, I still like her,
but we're gonna have to deal with this.

185
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:54,205
- I gotta go stop him.
- And I've got a blue sweater to steam.

186
00:10:54,306 --> 00:10:56,137
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

187
00:10:56,242 --> 00:11:01,270
<i>Gob raced to confront Tio,
with Michael in hot pursuit.</i>

188
00:11:04,984 --> 00:11:08,818
<i>George Michael, having failed to get
the information he needed from anyone else...</i>

189
00:11:08,921 --> 00:11:12,721
<i>made the ultimate sacrifice
and went to the keeper of the family secrets.</i>

190
00:11:12,825 --> 00:11:16,955
- So, uh, it's about Maeby.
- Oh! That's a lost cause.

191
00:11:17,062 --> 00:11:20,429
- But you get what you pay for, huh?
- Yeah.

192
00:11:20,533 --> 00:11:24,594
- Wait. What-What do you mean, "pay"?
- Fertility tests, lab fees...

193
00:11:24,703 --> 00:11:26,671
donors and implants.

194
00:11:26,772 --> 00:11:29,605
She's not real.
She was made in a cup.

195
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:34,168
Like soup... a hundred and thirty
thousand dollar cup of soup.

196
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,976
How do you like them egg rolls,
Mr. Goldstone?

197
00:11:37,082 --> 00:11:40,415
All I know is it took an extra year
before we could add a den.

198
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:43,249
So are you saying we're
not directly related?

199
00:11:43,355 --> 00:11:47,655
I'm saying she already spent
her inheritance getting here.

200
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,924
<i>Gob, meanwhile, had finally
shown up at the El Amor Prohibido set.</i>

201
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:59,167
Hey, guy. They tell me you're the actor
who plays Marta's brother, Tio.

202
00:11:59,271 --> 00:12:02,536
<i>-? Cómo?
- Oh, you're gonna be in a coma, all right.</i>

203
00:12:02,641 --> 00:12:05,667
<i>Unfortunately, the actor who played Tio...</i>

204
00:12:05,778 --> 00:12:10,010
<i>had also starred in a Mexican film
about the life of Oscar De La Hoya.</i>

205
00:12:12,952 --> 00:12:15,284
Gob. Hey, hey.

206
00:12:15,387 --> 00:12:20,450
- You all right?
- Where am I? Am I in...
two-thirds of a hospital room?

207
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:23,050
Yeah, listen, um...

208
00:12:24,863 --> 00:12:27,923
It's me.

209
00:12:29,969 --> 00:12:35,032
<i>I'm the guy that she likes.
"Hermano" is brother.</i>

210
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,108
Me.

211
00:12:39,712 --> 00:12:43,204
- Well, if I'd known it was you,
I wouldn't have minded.
- You wouldn't?

212
00:12:43,315 --> 00:12:46,546
Michael, you're a great guy.

213
00:12:47,987 --> 00:12:50,251
If you liked her, I would have said,
"Go for it."

214
00:12:52,091 --> 00:12:54,821
I do kind of like her.

215
00:12:56,061 --> 00:12:58,552
Go for it.

216
00:13:02,034 --> 00:13:04,059
Hi.

217
00:13:04,169 --> 00:13:06,933
My brother said
we can do it.

218
00:13:08,307 --> 00:13:11,071
That didn't come out as romantic
as I'd hoped, but...

219
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:24,353
Everything is finally perfect.

220
00:13:24,456 --> 00:13:29,450
Oh, wait. You jinxed it.
Don't worry. I'll turn it off.

221
00:13:29,561 --> 00:13:34,760
Mm. It's just my mother. She's probably
worried about my Dad's... hearing.

222
00:13:34,867 --> 00:13:37,927
Oh. With my Dad,
it is the vision.

223
00:13:38,037 --> 00:13:41,165
<i>Meanwhile, Tobias told Lindsay
that he couldn't do the part.</i>

224
00:13:41,273 --> 00:13:45,573
- It plays naked, okay?
- Tobias, we're gonna have to deal
with this sometime.

225
00:13:45,678 --> 00:13:47,805
I understand you not
wanting to do it on film...

226
00:13:47,913 --> 00:13:52,213
- but you can't even get undressed in front of me.
- It is not you, Lindsay.

227
00:13:52,318 --> 00:13:56,550
I can't get undressed alone.
I can't get undressed by myself.

228
00:13:56,655 --> 00:14:00,113
I mean, this is a real affliction.
I'm sorry it's not recognized here in the states.

229
00:14:00,225 --> 00:14:02,955
But I know for a fact that there are
two members of German Parliament.

230
00:14:03,062 --> 00:14:05,997
<i>They're called
"nein wohlstandig" nude.</i>

231
00:14:06,098 --> 00:14:09,829
But they're German, so...
They speak German, so they have a different...

232
00:14:09,935 --> 00:14:14,872
Yeah, well, it's not normal,
and ignoring it isn't gonna make it go away.

233
00:14:14,973 --> 00:14:17,942
You've got nothing
to be ashamed of.

234
00:14:18,043 --> 00:14:21,945
Please, please don't make fun.

235
00:14:22,047 --> 00:14:24,413
I'm not making fun.

236
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,418
Look, how 'bout we
do this together?

237
00:14:30,522 --> 00:14:33,650
You take off your shirt,
and I'll take off my jacket.

238
00:14:35,494 --> 00:14:39,225
You know, this family can be pretty
screwed up sometimes. But the good news is...

239
00:14:39,331 --> 00:14:44,064
Actually, I used to think that, too,
but it's better than the alternative.

240
00:14:44,169 --> 00:14:47,400
Well, have you explored all the alternatives?
'Cause I guess what I'm getting at is...

241
00:14:47,506 --> 00:14:49,804
No, but I'm glad I have
this family, you know?

242
00:14:49,908 --> 00:14:53,344
'Cause I know I said some bad stuff,
but it's much better here than it was in Boston.

243
00:14:53,445 --> 00:14:58,007
<i>And I have a cousin here. So even if my
parents do get divorced, I have you, right?</i>

244
00:14:58,117 --> 00:15:01,883
<i>George Michael realized
that no matter how much it upset him...</i>

245
00:15:01,987 --> 00:15:04,012
<i>he didn't want to take
Maeby's family away from her.</i>

246
00:15:04,123 --> 00:15:08,583
- Yeah, you got us all right.
- Now all I need is a boyfriend.

247
00:15:14,398 --> 00:15:18,459
<i>Lucille was left alone
with her oldest son at the courthouse.</i>

248
00:15:18,569 --> 00:15:20,696
just you and me, huh?

249
00:15:20,805 --> 00:15:25,037
God, why am I the only one who
ever comes through in this family?

250
00:15:25,142 --> 00:15:27,269
<i>And George Sr. was led into the courtroom.</i>

251
00:15:27,378 --> 00:15:30,711
- Where the hell is everybody?
- I'm here, Dad.

252
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:34,546
I can't believe no one showed up.
I don't know. Maybe it's for the best.

253
00:15:34,652 --> 00:15:38,053
Maybe I should just stay in prison
so my family can be free.

254
00:15:38,155 --> 00:15:41,750
- Look, you're my husband,
and you belong back at home with me.
- Wow.

255
00:15:41,859 --> 00:15:44,760
- You really love me.
- Call it what you want.

256
00:15:44,862 --> 00:15:47,330
I'm tired of paying Lupe
to clean one dish.

257
00:15:47,431 --> 00:15:51,561
<i>I'm sorry, sorry. I'm so late.
I had another hearing.</i>

258
00:15:51,669 --> 00:15:57,232
I think I'm gonna
get off, huh? I have a good lawyer.

259
00:15:57,341 --> 00:16:00,606
You look great in red. Okay.

260
00:16:02,646 --> 00:16:06,912
"Anyhoo," what are we doing here?
What's the plan?

261
00:16:07,017 --> 00:16:09,747
The plan? You're our lawyer.

262
00:16:09,854 --> 00:16:12,254
It's a figure of speech.
You're gonna be fine.

263
00:16:14,692 --> 00:16:19,129
Oh, for God's sake. He's on his own
for two days, and he joins a gang.

264
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,596
These guys?
Oh, I've got them for the afternoon.

265
00:16:21,699 --> 00:16:24,964
Besides, they're the only thing
I have left to live for in this world.

266
00:16:25,069 --> 00:16:29,335
Oh, stop being so dramatic.
You know where I live.

267
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,102
I wasn't talking about you, Mom.
I was talking about Marta.

268
00:16:33,144 --> 00:16:35,044
Excuse me.

269
00:16:35,146 --> 00:16:40,379
You were serious? 'Cause I got news for you, pal.
Marta's been interested in Michael.

270
00:16:40,484 --> 00:16:44,944
That's right... dull,
nothing-going-on-upstairs...

271
00:16:46,557 --> 00:16:49,355
- Michael.
- Yeah, I know.

272
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:52,122
- I saw them making out at her front door.
- What? When?

273
00:16:52,229 --> 00:16:54,424
just now. Huh!

274
00:16:54,532 --> 00:16:57,592
The stuff I've got to work out with Marta
just keeps piling up.

275
00:16:57,701 --> 00:17:00,693
- Unbelievable.
- All rise.

276
00:17:00,805 --> 00:17:04,798
<i>This court is now in session,
the Honorable Lionel Ping presiding.</i>

277
00:17:04,909 --> 00:17:07,571
- Oh! We've got Ping.
- I want to remind you...

278
00:17:07,678 --> 00:17:11,136
that there are no cameras
allowed in my courtroom.

279
00:17:11,248 --> 00:17:14,684
<i>Conspiracy, racketeering,
evidence tampering...</i>

280
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:18,380
fraud, theft,
grand theft, petty theft...

281
00:17:18,489 --> 00:17:21,925
- Wow. l-I did not get that page.
- resisting arrest...

282
00:17:22,026 --> 00:17:23,994
<i>- Michael.
- resisting arrest at the scene.</i>

283
00:17:24,094 --> 00:17:28,758
- How dare you!
- Now, come on. You said it was okay.
And nothing happened!

284
00:17:28,866 --> 00:17:31,300
<i>- Oh, did I?
- Take it easy.</i>

285
00:17:31,402 --> 00:17:33,370
<i>- Order!
- Is that my belt?</i>

286
00:17:33,471 --> 00:17:38,170
<i>- Well, so what? Get your hands off me!
- What is your problem?</i>

287
00:17:40,845 --> 00:17:45,873
What are you doing? What's
the matter with you? Get off him! George!

288
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:48,577
<i>George Sr., having never heard his charges...</i>

289
00:17:48,686 --> 00:17:51,883
<i>listed consecutively in one sitting,
panicked and ran with great intensity.</i>

290
00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:55,925
<i>Michael and Gob continued their fight
onto the courthouse steps.</i>

291
00:17:56,026 --> 00:17:58,085
Stop it before someone gets hit in the face!

292
00:17:58,195 --> 00:18:03,030
<i>Buster realized this was his opportunity
to fulfill a longtime fantasy.</i>

293
00:18:03,133 --> 00:18:06,534
Oh, for God's sake! Barry!

294
00:18:06,637 --> 00:18:10,505
<i>Barry, too, felt overwhelmed
by the charges leveled against his client...</i>

295
00:18:10,608 --> 00:18:12,409
<i>- and also took flight.
- What are you doing?
They'll add ten years to your sentence.</i>

296
00:18:12,409 --> 00:18:14,969
<i>- and also took flight.
- What are you doing?
They'll add ten years to your sentence.</i>

297
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:17,206
They'll never catch me!

298
00:18:17,314 --> 00:18:21,250
<i>Oh, good. We better get you
back in your cell.</i>

299
00:18:21,352 --> 00:18:25,254
It's gettin' kind of crazy out there.

300
00:18:25,356 --> 00:18:29,918
<i>Back at the model home, things
were heating up for Lindsay and Tobias as well.</i>

301

<i>- I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't.
- For me, Tobias.</i>

302
00:18:37,535 --> 00:18:39,503
<i>That too.</i>

303
00:18:43,641 --> 00:18:48,669
<i>- You did it.
- Now what?</i>

304
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:51,805
<i>- Now this.
- And for the first time in years...</i>

305
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:54,248
<i>Lindsay and Tobias became intimate.</i>

306
00:18:54,351 --> 00:18:57,411
<i>The brothers'fight, meanwhile,
continued into the park...</i>

307

00:19:00,124 --> 00:19:02,592
- I'll kill you!
- Oh, God!

309
00:19:02,693 --> 00:19:05,127
<i>- Go, go, go, go!
- Lucille had decided that perhaps...</i>

310
00:19:05,229 --> 00:19:07,959
<i>she was better off
without any of them.</i>

311
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:10,863
- Me! Me, me, me!
- Buster, get out of the way!

312
00:19:10,968 --> 00:19:13,528
Hit me in the face!
Hit me in the face! Hit me in the face!

313
00:19:13,637 --> 00:19:15,832
<i>- Please! Hit me in the face!
- No! Buster!</i>

314
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:18,306
<i>- Aah! Buster!
- While Marta...</i>

315
00:19:18,409 --> 00:19:22,277
<i>who'd been told the hearing would last
10 minutes, got tired of waiting.</i>

316
00:19:22,379 --> 00:19:24,745
Hey! Hey!

317
00:19:24,848 --> 00:19:27,510
- Marta.
- Marta.

318
00:19:27,618 --> 00:19:31,952
What is wrong with you? I thought you were
good people. I thought you were noble.

319
00:19:32,056 --> 00:19:34,991
I thought you cared about family,
but you clearly don't.

320
00:19:37,328 --> 00:19:41,128
l-It's over.
Both of you. It's over.

321
00:19:41,231 --> 00:19:43,290
Wait, wait.
What about, what about me?

322
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,800
I'm sorry.
I'm not totally sure who you are.

323
00:19:46,904 --> 00:19:49,304
Wow! Wow.

324
00:19:49,406 --> 00:19:51,874
That's what it feels like
to get punched in the face.

325
00:19:51,976 --> 00:19:57,073
- Can you believe that?
- Yeah, lecturing us about family.

326
00:19:57,181 --> 00:20:00,173
I mean, who needs that?

327
00:20:00,284 --> 00:20:02,514
And what are we doing?
Hey, we're brothers.

328
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:07,387
- That's gotta count for something.
- That counts for everything.

329
00:20:07,491 --> 00:20:11,791
- I'm not gonna throw it away over some woman.
- Heh! Especially not my woman.

330
00:20:11,895 --> 00:20:16,195
- Hmm?
- But you're right, you're right.
I mean, this is what's real.

331
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:21,237
- This is what lasts. Everything else is just petty.
- Yeah, totally beneath us.

332
00:20:21,338 --> 00:20:24,205
- Yeah.
- And by the way, I don't know
how you call her your woman...

333
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:28,972
when she clearly prefers me, and she was
all prepared to be my girlfriend...

334
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:31,912
- calling me her boyfriend...
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hey!

335
00:20:32,016 --> 00:20:34,883
- Hang on one second.
- This is all moot, because she
never got a chance to know me.

336
00:20:34,985 --> 00:20:40,719
Now, will someone please have the decency
to punch me in the face?

337
00:20:46,296 --> 00:20:48,264
Aah!

338
00:20:49,466 --> 00:20:52,026
- Well, it's effective.
- Yeah, it really is.

339
00:20:53,303 --> 00:20:55,533
<i>On the next
Arrested Development.</i>

340
00:20:55,639 --> 00:20:57,800
<i>Tobias quietly overcompensates.</i>

341
00:20:57,908 --> 00:21:01,207
Please tell me
there's some coffee left.

342
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:04,178
Give me some.

343
00:21:04,281 --> 00:21:07,808
I slept very well
last night.
