1
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,710
<i>Even though</i>
<i>it was only a hundred miles</i>

2
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,790
<i>from her hometown</i>
<i>of Newport Beach,</i>

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,300
<i>the desert created a whole new</i>
<i>value system for Lindsay Bluth.</i>

4
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,800
I'd give $20,000
for a lemonade right now.

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,720
<i>For the most part.</i>

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,600
<i>It was here that she'd moved</i>
<i>with her activist boyfriend...</i>

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,810
Marky! Mommy needs mescaline!

8
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:30,850
<i>...and his mother.</i>

9
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:32,980
And tell your girlfriend DeBrie

10
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,230
to shovel that ostrich crap!

11
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:35,860
It's not DeBrie, Ma Bark.

12
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,520
It's Lindsay.

13
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,190
I just cut off my hair.

14
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,490
I know who you are.

15
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:41,780
Now start shoveling!

16
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,740
God, you're lazier than Lindsay.

17
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,780
Marky, hurry!

18
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:48,660
- There's another dead iguana.
- Oh.

19
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,410
What does this mean?

20
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,330
Probably those bastards
next door.

21
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:55,210
<i>The bastards next door were</i>
<i>actually a gathered group</i>

22
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:59,340
<i>of CEOs who were attending</i>
<i>a mid-summer sweat and squeeze.</i>

23
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:00,960
They want us off their land.

24
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:02,930
Probably so they can
build a border wall.

25
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,840
They just want to separate
the whites from the browns.

26
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:07,680
You really are color-blind.

27
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,970
Face-blind.

28
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:10,600
Fortunately, I can see color.

29
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,480
That's how I can tell
the browns are the Mexicans.

30
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,110
Anyway, I thought
I scared those bastards off

31
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,310
<i>by scaring their leader.</i>

32
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,150
The strong will become the weak.

33
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:21,990
<i>But I think I overdid it first</i>
<i>on the maca, because I ended up</i>

34
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:23,610
<i>seeing two of him.</i>

35
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,410
But to kill an innocent iguana,

36
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:27,410
this beautiful creature
of the desert...

37
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:28,870
That lizard bastard bit me!

38
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:30,160
God!

39
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,000
Who keeps numbing
these desert animals?

40
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,080
No, no, we'll kill it later.

41
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,250
Mom, lizard bite!

42
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:35,830
Put some rubbing mescaline
on it!

43
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,630
<i>Lindsay hated her new life,</i>

44
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:38,920
<i>but even more,</i>
<i>she hated herself</i>

45
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,670
<i>for hating her new life.</i>

46
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,710
Marky, I just don't know how
much more of this I can take.

47
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,590
I'm surrounded
by squalor and death,

48
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,590
and I still can't be happy.

49
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,180
Yeah, well,
it's only gonna get worse,

50
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,220
'cause they're chasing us
off the land.

51
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,510
I mean, where are we gonna go?

52
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,600
Hey, new girl, I just heard

53
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,270
about your mother's trial.

54
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,850
She was sent away.

55
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,770
<i>Lindsay had missed</i>
<i>her own mother's trial,</i>

56
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:01,360
<i>and for that, she'd never</i>
<i>be able to forgive her...</i>

57
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,190
Hey, I know a place
that just opened up.

58
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,490
<i>...herself.</i>

59
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,490
<i>Now the story of a family</i>

60
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:08,660
<i>whose future</i>
<i>was abruptly canceled,</i>

61
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,160
<i>and the one daughter</i>
<i>who had no choice</i>

62
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,370
<i>but to keep her life together.</i>

63
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,500
<i>It's Lindsay's</i>
Arrested Development.

64
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,170
<i>- Lindsay wanted to move</i>
- That's great.

65
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,220
<i>to her mother's</i>
<i>empty penthouse,</i>

66
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,470
<i>- but Marky wouldn't think</i>
- You dropped your shovel.

67
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:28,720
<i>of leaving the old bird behind.</i>

68
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:31,760
<i>So it was a party of three</i>

69
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:35,060
<i>that had to sneak into</i>
<i>the Balboa Towers.</i>

70
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,600
<i>Although Marky</i>
<i>was having trouble</i>

71
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,440
<i>- accepting what appeared to be</i>
- Come on, Cindy.

72
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,690
<i>a lavish lifestyle.</i>

73
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,110
- What do you think?
- Ugh.

74
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,940
Smells weird in here.
What is that?

75
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:47,360
I think it's just... not urine.

76
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,910
And we're not moving in,

77
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,490
we're occupying a space
with central air.

78
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:53,450
Cindy?

79
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:55,290
You okay?

80
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:58,040
: Look, Lindsay,
Cindy already marked the master.

81
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,040
Okay.

82
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,250
This will be where she goes.

83
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:02,880
So we're staying.

84
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:06,800
And we will change the world
and hold our heads high.

85
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,180
And it might be nice to live
like normal people for a change.

86
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,760
Let's put some newspaper
on these windows.

87
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,770
<i>One year later, however,</i>

88
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,940
<i>the only thing</i>
<i>they'd actually changed was</i>

89
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,480
<i>getting the "not urine" smell</i>
<i>out of the penthouse.</i>

90
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,650
You're looking at Lindsay.

91
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,700
Still Lindsay.

92
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,160
Oh. Hey, Linds.

93
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,080
- How was beg?
- Beg was good.

94
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,830
I found some<i>tres leches</i>cake.

95
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:35,870
That's great.

96
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,580
Hey, did you clean up?

97
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,120
No, no, I just cleared out a
space to work on the Love bomb.

98
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:43,090
Oh, okay. I'll, uh, change
out of these filthy clothes

99
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,550
and into some filthy lingerie.

100
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,340
I don't think I washed it.

101
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:49,720
No, I meant what we're gonna do
to this guy-- Herbert Love.

102
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,300
Oh.

103
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,260
<i>Herbert Love was a very</i>
<i>conservative candidate</i>

104
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,260
<i>for a very conservative seat</i>
<i>in the very conservative</i>

105
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,890
<i>- House of Representatives.</i>
- Look, look, look.

106
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:59,180
Am I guilty of anything? Yes.

107
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,440
Of having a great
sense of humor.

108
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,980
But the two women
who accused me of this crime

109
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,150
do<i>not</i>have
a great sense of humor.

110
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:08,940
Look, in fact, I'll tell you the
joke and let you be the judge...

111
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,530
<i>Although he was prone to</i>

112
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,240
<i>the more than occasional</i>
<i>harassment scandal.</i>

113
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,660
I forgot the joke.

114
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,030
Oh, he's about to be harassed,
all right.

115
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,660
I'm gonna spray the bastards
with ink and glitter.

116
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,790
It'll be in their ears
for weeks.

117
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,830
Thing is, I can't find
the glitter anywhere.

118
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,250
Did you take the silver glitter?

119
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:26,380
Nope. I mean,
I'd say check the junk drawer,

120
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,170
but I can't
differentiate anymore.

121
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,550
Oh, God, what is this?

122
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:31,760
Oh. Okay, good.
Perfect timing,

123
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,260
because this is
where you come in.

124
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,600
A lot of this has to do
with ink compression,

125
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,220
oxygen capacity,
expulsion pressures.

126
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,310
But the point is,
three days before the event,

127
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,440
I'm gonna take the explosive
and hide in the podium.

128
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,350
On the night of the event,
at exactly 7:30,

129
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,900
I'm gonna pull the pin
to the tank.

130
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,520
Then you're gonna
knock on the podium door

131
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,360
to let me know
that the coast is clear.

132
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,320
When Love steps up to the podium
at exactly 8:00, blam!

133
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,620
The podium doors burst open,
and he and everyone will be...

134
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,330
Blue in the face, yeah.

135
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:59,120
That's better than
what I had, actually.

136
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,950
I was gonna say they'd be
covered in ink and glitter.

137
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,500
Or we can support Lucille 2,
who he's running against.

138
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,080
She's right across the hall.

139
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,670
No, no!
She's part of the problem.

140
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,710
Wait, you haven't been
going over there, by the way?

141
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,510
- No one can know we're here.
- Of course not.

142
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,470
Does it look like I'm lying?

143
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,550
<i>It did.</i>

144
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:18,430
<i>But not to a man</i>
<i>with face-blindness.</i>

145
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,350
Yeah, no, I guess not.

146
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,100
<i>Because Lindsay</i>
<i>could only spend</i>

147
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,140
<i>so many hours with a shrill,</i>
<i>feathered creature...</i>

148
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,610
<i>...and needed to get away.</i>

149
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:28,650
You look marvelous in that!

150
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:29,980
Here, try this on.

151
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,570
I can't believe
how much I've missed

152
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,240
the feel of anything
that isn't hemp.

153
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,280
And try this on.

154
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,700
Isn't that funny?

155
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,450
I used to wear that
with the Captain.

156
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:38,450
And I was...

157
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:39,830
Tennille?

158
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:42,000
And not make contact, yes!

159
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,370
What am I gonna do,
cut it down for my foster child?

160
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,170
<i>That is what she wanted to do,</i>

161
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:49,710
<i>until he threatened to call</i>
<i>Social Services.</i>

162
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,710
Oh, look what I made you.

163
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,380
Oh! I love it!

164
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,260
It's glittery!

165
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,720
<i>Lindsay was no stranger</i>
<i>to making campaign posters,</i>

166
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,310
<i>having made several</i>
<i>in her seventh grade</i>

167
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:04,230
<i>class president campaign</i>
<i>against Sally Sitwell.</i>

168
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,810
<i>Sally ultimately</i>
<i>proved successful</i>

169
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:09,360
<i>with a more fact-based</i>
<i>campaign.</i>

170
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,860
A couple of tiny notes, hon.

171
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,440
There are two S's in "congress."

172
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:15,240
And I just
call myself Lucille...

173
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,990
Lucille 1. I'm so sorry.

174
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,240
No.

175
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,320
Just Lucille.

176
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:20,870
But I love it!

177
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:23,410
Oh, I wish you'd officially work
for my campaign.

178
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,660
We could make such a difference.

179
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,830
Well, Marky says that's not

180
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,250
the way we should make change.

181
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:29,750
Oh, speaking of, do you mind

182
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,790
if I go through
your couch cushions?

183
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,840
Oh, honey, I wish you'd take the
rest of this<i>tres leches</i>cake.

184
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,180
It's from a dear
Hispanic supporter.

185
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,260
And I'll never get it
into the bay in one piece.

186
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,640
Honestly, Lucille 2,
you've been like a mother to me.

187
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,140
Aw.

188
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,060
Except kind and loving
and willing to let me eat.

189
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,350
It just blows me away.

190
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,980
<i>Lindsay knew she had to keep</i>

191
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,280
<i>her secret life</i>
<i>of luxury hidden...</i>

192
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,610
You're looking at Lindsay.

193
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:55,780
Still Lindsay.

194
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,240
<i>...from a boyfriend that was</i>

195
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,070
<i>preparing to squat in a podium</i>

196
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,870
<i>for three days</i>
<i>with a paint bomb.</i>

197
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,830
But, Marky, I mean,
won't you go crazy in there?

198
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,870
Oh, no, that's nothing.
I once did a week and a half

199
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,370
in an oil drum
just to throw a pie

200
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:07,460
at Arnold Schwarzenegger.

201
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,870
I never heard about that.

202
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,880
Oh, yeah, well,
the press tried to spin it as

203
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,210
"Hippie tries to play pie-tin
Frisbee with the governor,"

204
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,210
but... this time,
I'm eating beforehand.

205
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,220
Yeah, I-I see that.

206
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,970
Hey, can I get you a fork?

207
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:22,260
'Cause that's my brother
whose face you're licking.

208
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,430
That's a face?

209
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,640
Everything I do is wrong.

210
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,890
I knew you wouldn't be

211
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:28,940
on board with this, Lindsay.

212
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,020
I'm sorry to say this,

213
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,520
but you are losing your passion.

214
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,770
What passion?
You don't even look at me.

215
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,690
I don't know
if I've said this before--

216
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,150
it's not important or anything--

217
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,780
but I'm really, really pretty.

218
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,410
I'm the straightest guy
you know!

219
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:41,740
Why does every man feel like

220
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,240
they have to say that to me?

221
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,450
Quiet! Cindy's in heat.

222
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:47,290
You know how much she hates it
when we argue.

223
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,080
: Now listen to me.
This protest of mine

224
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,420
- can really make a difference.
- Yeah, it's gonna land you

225
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,670
- in jail, Marky.
- Oh, there it is.

226
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:53,960
Oh, yeah, so that's-- oh, yeah.

227
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,550
You know what,
you are just as selfish

228
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,090
- and money-hungry
as you ever were. -No, I'm...

229
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:58,970
- Yes, you are.
- That's not true.

230
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,880
Ooh, a Neiman's catalog.

231
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:04,470
<i>But it was what she found</i>
<i>stuck inside the catalog</i>

232
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,010
<i>that got her attention.</i>

233
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,720
<i>And that's when she found</i>
<i>the mother lode.</i>

234
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:10,890
"From Gangie 4: Facelift."

235
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,520
What a load of...

236
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,110
Mother.

237
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:17,900
<i>And this time, she did</i>
<i>make a court appearance.</i>

238
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,860
Cheryl, you've got no backhand!

239
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,360
I'm working the whole court,

240
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:25,530
and you keep hitting the balls
high.

241
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:29,000
Oh, great, looks like we've got
another high-end hooker in here.

242
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,410
Oh, thank you, Mother.

243
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,620
<i>So, let's cut to the chase.</i>

244
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:36,250
I want to talk to you about
a check for plastic surgery.

245
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:38,340
I already wrote you
a check for that.

246
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,340
<i>Lucille had,</i>
<i>back when Lindsay thought</i>

247
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,970
<i>- she was only 12 years old.</i>
- New nose.

248
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:45,890
<i>Worrying it would hurt</i>
<i>her daughter's feelings...</i>

249
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,310
Put a "Y" on there.

250
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:49,310
<i>...she put a fun spin on it.</i>

251
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,930
- "Nosy."
- <i>And you should be</i>

252
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,310
<i>thanking me for that.</i>

253
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:54,060
You looked like a can opener.

254
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,310
No, a check for my daughter.

255
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,520
She's gorgeous.

256
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,230
And I love her
just the way she is.

257
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,240
When was the last time
you saw her?

258
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,360
She's been living
with her father the past year,

259
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:08,540
and it's been... really hard.

260
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,750
I'll be out on parole
by the time you work up a tear.

261
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:14,710
What makes you think I wrote
a check to your daughter, nosy?

262
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,080
It came to the penthouse.

263
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:17,750
Well, well.

264
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,170
Little Miss Lives-Off-the-Land
is living in my penthouse.

265
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:23,470
Okay, so you figured it out,
Gene Parmesan.

266
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:27,800
Just goes to show, the apple
does not far from the tree fall.

267
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:30,180
I am like you nothing.

268
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,430
You're not even my real mother.

269
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,060
I am a political activist.

270
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,440
Oh, you're a lot more like me
than you know, sister.

271
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,690
Except I can back up
my bad choices.

272
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,530
I'm doing hard time.

273
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:43,900
Your 3:00 p.m.
hot rock massage is open.

274
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,740
Thanks for coming, sweetheart.

275
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,700
- Mm.
- <i>But Lindsay wanted</i>

276
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,910
<i>to prove that she wasn't like</i>
<i>her so-called mother.</i>

277
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:54,120
<i>And that's why she did this.</i>

278
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:56,830
I'm in.

279
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,920
Let's bomb the bastard.

280
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,670
It's Lindsay.

281
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:04,220
Oh, yes!
: Yeah!

282
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,390
<i>Lindsay and her</i>
<i>boyfriend Marky arrived in--</i>

283
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:11,930
<i>get this--</i>
<i>Beverly Hills to prepare</i>

284
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:14,480
<i>for their act</i>
<i>of glittery social protest.</i>

285
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,480
<i>But Lindsay was having</i>
<i>second thoughts.</i>

286
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,560
Marky, look, um,

287
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:22,610
I have this check that my mother
wrote for my daughter.

288
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:25,400
It can buy us a lot of leaflets
against Love.

289
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:27,320
And also a lot
of Nature's Miracle.

290
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,870
You know, there's a huge sale
going on right now at Petco...

291
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,410
No, never! Rip it up! No money!

292
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:34,040
And don't worry,
I've thought of everything.

293
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,250
<i>He had.</i>

294
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:36,500
Except for someone
to watch Cindy.

295
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,330
Oh, but she's locked in.

296
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:39,540
What's the worst
that can happen?

297
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,050
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

298
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:46,800
Ah! What a great day to step out

299
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,010
onto an over-irrigated
golf course and play a game

300
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:52,470
that wastes vast acres
of usable, farm-able land.

301
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,470
<i>And after a few nights</i>
<i>in the trailer,</i>

302
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:58,440
<i>Lindsay showed up</i>
<i>in Lucille 2's Tennille wig</i>

303
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,770
<i>to be ready to release Marky</i>
<i>from the podium</i>

304
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,820
<i>at the appointed time,</i>

305
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,230
<i>and then stroll out together</i>
<i>in disguise.</i>

306
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,360
<i>I think that's what</i>
<i>this part refers to</i>

307
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,820
<i>back when the disguise was</i>

308
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,870
<i>going to be</i>
<i>a two-part horse costume.</i>

309
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:14,240
<i>But soon, she ran into a father</i>
<i>she hadn't seen in over a year.</i>

310
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:17,910
Lindsay, I forgot,
you dyed your hair.

311
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,330
Do you have any money?

312
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:20,460
<i>And that's how Lindsay</i>

313
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,880
<i>parted with the check for Maeby</i>

314
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,670
<i>that Marky had told her</i>
<i>to rip up.</i>

315
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,220
<i>And it was then</i>
<i>she ran into a daughter...</i>

316
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,840
Maeby.

317
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,550
<i>...whose $50,000 check</i>
<i>she'd just given away...</i>

318
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,850
Mom.

319
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,260
<i>...stealing some</i>
<i>coconut shrimp.</i>

320
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,470
Of course you're here.

321
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,220
I should've known you'd be

322
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,100
- supporting this right-wing,
dangerous crackpot. -No, no.

323
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,730
I am here undercover
with my boyfriend.

324
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:42,650
We are gonna take down Love

325
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:46,280
with a random act
of senseless nonviolence.

326
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,320
<i>Maeby felt a foreign feeling.</i>

327
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,410
I actually respect that.

328
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:52,030
- Thank you, Maeby.
<i>- Which is why,</i>

329
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:54,240
<i>for the first time</i>
<i>in her adult life...</i>

330
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,830
So what are you doing here?

331
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:58,290
<i>...Maeby was totally honest</i>
<i>with her mother.</i>

332
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:00,330
I'm getting a lifetime
achievement award

333
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:02,580
for my work
in the entertainment business.

334
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,080
I tried.

335
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:05,800
Tell your therapist I tried.

336
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,340
<i>But realizing</i>
<i>she was still too early</i>

337
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,260
<i>to let Marky out of the podium,</i>

338
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,550
<i>Lindsay headed to the bar,</i>

339
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,510
<i>and that's when she met the man</i>
<i>she was there to sabotage...</i>

340
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,970
Is it just me,

341
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:18,770
or are we the only two people
who don't fit in

342
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:22,020
with all these
Orange County phonies?

343
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,650
<i>...and had no idea who he was.</i>

344
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:27,820
They are a bunch of phonies.

345
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,150
I usually don't even go
to these things.

346
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,360
<i>And perhaps it was</i>

347
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,990
<i>because he reminded her so much</i>

348
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:34,570
<i>of Tobias</i>
<i>when they first started dating,</i>

349
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,280
<i>but Lindsay flirted back.</i>

350
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:37,740
What's your name, princess?

351
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,250
Cindy Featherbottom.

352
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:42,620
Of the Laguna Beach
Featherbottoms?

353
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,460
Are you trying to find out
where I live?

354
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,050
And your favorite kind
of jewelry. -

355
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:48,880
<i>Lindsay hadn't heard</i>
<i>the word "jewelry"</i>

356
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,260
<i>in a long time</i>
<i>but tried to stay strong.</i>

357
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,220
How do I know you're not
one of these phonies?

358
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:58,350
The only phony I'm interested in
is your phony number.

359
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:00,350
<i>And like Cinderella</i>
<i>at the ball,</i>

360
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:02,890
<i>Lindsay really felt</i>
<i>like a princess for a change...</i>

361
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,100
Okay.

362
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,860
<i>...but also like Cinderella,</i>

363
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,400
<i>- she lost track of the time...</i>
- It's, uh, 714... -Mm-hmm.

364
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,530
<i>...and had forgotten</i>

365
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:16,240
<i>to release Marky</i>
<i>from the podium,</i>

366
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,160
<i>and that's when she was struck</i>

367
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,410
<i>- with an eerie sense...</i>
- Right this way, sir,

368
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,160
- right this way.
<i>- ...of déjà vu.</i>

369
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,250
Lindsay.

370
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:25,540
Oh, God, he blued himself.

371
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,880
<i>Lindsay's attempt</i>
<i>to create a disaster</i>

372
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,220
<i>for Herbert Love was</i>
<i>a complete disaster,</i>

373
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:36,050
<i>and as she tried to slip away</i>
<i>without drawing attention</i>

374
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:38,050
<i>to herself, she was</i>
<i>once again approached...</i>

375
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,890
- Cindy Featherbottom.-<i>... by the</i>
<i>man whose name she never got.</i>

376
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:41,310
Here's my private number.

377
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,640
Give me a call;
perhaps we can engage

378
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,310
- in some sexual congress.
<i>- Although that's</i>

379
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:47,270
<i>a total giveaway, right?</i>

380
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:49,770
What a wonderful sense of humor.

381
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,820
I'd like that very much.

382
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,610
Sir, the press awaits.

383
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:54,820
Now, I don't know what this nut
was protesting tonight.

384
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,200
I thought you were supposed
to be sticking it

385
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,990
to the man,
not the other way around.

386
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,370
Maeby.

387
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:00,870
You think he likes me that way?

388
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:03,290
No, Mom, that's Herbert Love,

389
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:04,330
the man you're here to protest.

390
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:05,540
And I hear the guy with the bomb

391
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,710
snuck up here from Mexico.

392
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,750
That's why I say,

393
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:11,090
we have got to build a wall

394
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:13,210
- between us and Mexico.
- Oh, no.

395
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,090
H-How could you not
recognize him?

396
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:17,340
<i>In fairness</i>
<i>to Lindsay, it was Marky's</i>

397
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:20,260
<i>face-blindness that led him</i>
<i>to mistake this photo</i>

398
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,510
<i>for the candidate.</i>

399
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,100
<i>Why Lindsay failed to recognize</i>

400
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:26,980
<i>musical icon Nat King Cole</i>
<i>cannot be explained.</i>

401
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,020
But he's so modern looking.

402
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,770
I mean, obviously I didn't know
it was the man

403
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,860
whose politics
I'm here to protest.

404
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,030
I guess I was just having fun,

405
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,740
pretending I had
my old life back.

406
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,490
Well, we'll just be friends,
and I'm gonna keep it

407
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:40,080
light and fun with him
and not talk politics at all.

408
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,160
I can't believe
you're such a sellout.

409
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,830
-Are you really going
to whore yourself out like that?

410
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,960
- I am not a whore.
- Yeah, you're a whore.

411
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,870
I am not a whore.

412
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,380
Look, I am still committed
to my ideals

413
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,590
and to my Marky.

414
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,050
Lindsay!

415
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:54,670
Lindsay, Lindsay!

416
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,050
Well, you certainly have a type.

417
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:57,680
Lindsay? Have you seen a
woman named Lindsay?

418
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,930
If you see a woman
named Lindsay,

419
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:01,350
tell her to bail me out.

420
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,180
I'll do my best, sir.

421
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,270
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

422
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:05,810
Taxi.

423
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:07,310
Tell Lindsay to feed Cindy.

424
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,520
- She thinks she's...
- : Taxi.

425
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:13,150
<i>Lindsay was</i>
<i>as blue as one of her men</i>

426
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:15,440
<i>when she returned</i>
<i>to the penthouse,</i>

427
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,650
<i>and that's when she decided</i>
<i>to get half in the bag.</i>

428
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,830
<i>But even though she felt</i>
<i>bad...</i>-

429
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:25,450
<i>...she was at least able</i>
<i>to turn a man's head...</i>

430
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:27,120
Gentlemen, start your engines.

431
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,830
<i>...although, perhaps had</i>
<i>his head not turned...</i>

432
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,420
- Buster.
<i>- ...he would have seen</i>

433
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,750
<i>- the ostrich warning</i>
<i>on the door.</i>-No, Gob.

434
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,040
Oh!

435
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:34,670
<i>After another night</i>

436
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:37,800
<i>in the trailer,</i>
<i>Lindsay went to the model home</i>

437
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,470
<i>to give a daughter</i>
<i>who called her a whore</i>

438
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,930
<i>a piece of her mind.</i>

439
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:43,220
Hi, sweetie.

440
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,390
<i>Of course, she needed a place</i>
<i>to stay, so she couldn't</i>

441
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:47,810
<i>- just jump right in.</i>-I thought
I'd surprise you with a visit.

442
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:50,020
Yeah, well, the bags are
certainly a surprise.

443
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,350
You're not thinking
of moving in, are you?

444
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,360
- What? No.
- Yeah, because

445
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,650
I don't think
Dad would be cool with it.

446
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,110
- No, of course not.
- Yeah.

447
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:59,150
- Is he in?
- No.

448
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,070
Oh, what happened there?

449
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,660
Kids or people who like kids.

450
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,120
So, where's Marky?

451
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,960
God, Marky will be
in jail for quite a while.

452
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,620
<i>She actually had just</i>
<i>come from visiting him.</i>

453
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,920
So it, uh, turns out
the glitter was shrapnel grade.

454
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,960
They're upping my charges

455
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:20,300
from prank bomb
to non-Arab terrorism.

456
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,760
This is where
you letting me out

457
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,890
of the podium
would have really helped.

458
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:24,300
Why didn't you just come out?

459
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,260
I couldn't do it;
someone locked me in.

460
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:27,680
<i>In fact, it was Gob,</i>

461
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,430
<i>thinking he was trapping</i>
<i>the magician Tony Wonder</i>

462
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,810
<i>into one of his illusions.</i>

463
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:33,400
<i>Hey, Mark, you guys want to see</i>

464
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,690
a real failed magician,
you might want

465
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:35,770
to get down to the Opies
tonight.

466
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,320
It's going to be hysterical.

467
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,730
<i>I need you</i>
<i>to bail me out, Lindsay.</i>

468
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,400
- I need you to use that check.
- Oh, I...

469
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,610
I don't have that check anymore.

470
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:43,740
- What?
- You told me to rip it up.

471
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,160
I thought you said you
didn't believe in money.

472
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,580
I didn't until I realized
what it could keep me from.

473
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,120
Jail's a lot like Swappigans,

474
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,450
except there's only
one thing to swap.

475
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,750
It's scary.

476
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,040
- Anus tart.
- Yep,

477
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,250
Oh, God,
that could have been me.

478
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,340
Lindsay, listen to me--
I'm scared.

479
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,550
I'm scared,
I'm scared, I'm scared.

480
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,260
- I'm really scared.
- No touching.

481
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,590
<i>Actually it's kind of nice</i>

482
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,300
to have a little me time.

483
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,350
Oh, of course, that's why
you were giving Herbert Love

484
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:07,510
a little you time last night.

485
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,930
You were flirting with him
to get Marky out of jail.

486
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:11,480
Well, yeah, that is

487
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,810
what I should have been do--
what I did, yeah, yeah.

488
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,980
That's exactly
what I should have and did do.

489
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:21,110
And it's not that bad an idea,
actually.

490
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,990
You could get him to do anything
'cause he's probably

491
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:25,280
just one of those shallow guys
who's only interested in looks.

492
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,950
I miss that.

493
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:28,200
Missed that.

494
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,540
Yeah, you know,
maybe it would be

495
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,870
a good idea if I got
in touch with him.

496
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:35,040
I mean, he did give me his card.

497
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,040
Although I could never call him.

498
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,880
I could call him for you

499
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,130
and I'll tell him
it has to be tonight.

500
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:43,050
Well, the sooner the better.

501
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:44,220
Got to get Marky out of jail.

502
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,300
That's why the sooner
the better.

503
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,260
<i>So Maeby arranged</i>
<i>for a meeting</i>

504
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,970
<i>that evening at Hollywood's</i>
<i>exclusive Ealing Club</i>

505
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,020
<i>between Herbert Love</i>
<i>and Cindy Featherbottom.</i>

506
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,270
I like this place.

507
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:57,810
No cameras, no phones.

508
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,150
Everyone's cool.

509
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:01,320
Well, thank you
for being willing to meet.

510
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,820
Meet, greet.

511
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,400
Sure are sweet.

512
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,490
What a treat.

513
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:07,200
What did the lamb say?

514
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,280
Baa?

515
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:10,290
Bleat.

516
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:11,660
Ah, yes, of course.

517
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,080
I was just wondering,

518
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,210
is anything really bad going
to happen

519
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,580
to that blue guy from the rally?

520
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,630
Do you want to press charges?

521
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,300
Who can think of Little Boy Blue

522
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:23,300
- when I've got this beautiful
face in front of me? -Oh.

523
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,220
Thanks, haven't heard that
in a long time.

524
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,590
Your cheekbones are even higher
than my approval rating.

525
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,060
Your brain can register
my cheekbones?

526
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,680
I'll register 'em to vote.

527
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,140
-Your lips are
like a Murphy bed.

528
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,310
They don't take up much space,

529
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:38,400
but they are there
when you need 'em.

530
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:42,440
Okay, you are a poet.

531
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,570
You're wonderful.

532
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:47,530
But, um, yeah,
I-I do want to talk

533
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:49,280
to you about a couple of issues.

534
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:53,700
Can we just have one night where
we don't talk about politics?

535
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:56,540
Yes, yes, just one night.

536
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,210
- We deserve it.
- Let's get a room.

537
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,420
Yes-- no.

538
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,420
What?

539
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,500
Uh, I... okay.

540
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,130
We can talk in a room, I guess.

541
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:08,130
<i>And later,</i>
<i>down in the lobby, as Herbert</i>

542
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,930
<i>went off to do some business...</i>

543
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:11,550
You hang tight.

544
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,310
I'm going to meet with some
of my, uh, "constititutes."

545
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,600
<i>...Lindsay ran</i>
<i>into her brother Michael.</i>

546
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,350
- Hi-lo.
- Michael?

547
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,440
Hi.

548
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,020
- How are you?
- Oh, good, good.

549
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,360
I almost didn't recognize you.

550
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,940
- It's my hair.
- That's some of it,

551
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,690
but it's also, you're with a guy

552
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,990
that pretty much represents
everything you pretend to hate.

553
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,700
- Was that Herbert Love?
- Great, now I remember

554
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,280
why we fell out of touch.

555
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,370
No, Lindsay, I'm kidding,
kidding, kidding, I'm so sorry.

556
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:33,830
I'm sure that you're having
a great influence

557
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,450
on him, you know.

558
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,040
Thanks.

559
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,830
But if you really want
to blow him-- away,

560
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:43,540
you know the wall issue
that everyone is talking about?

561
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,420
The wall between Mexico
and the U.S.?

562
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,800
Tell him to take it down?

563
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,220
Or just not to put it up.
No wall yet.

564
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,300
Oh, no, there's no--
I knew that, yeah.

565
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,100
If you could get him

566
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,220
against the wall, Lindsay...

567
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,560
Well, I had no idea you were
this socially conscious.

568
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,390
<i>He wasn't.</i>

569
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,770
<i>In fact, he was just using</i>
<i>her Love connection</i>

570
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:04,570
<i>to make good</i>
<i>on a deal he'd struck</i>

571
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,690
<i>to get</i>
<i>his father's movie rights.</i>

572
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:09,110
Can you help me,
then, with Love?

573
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:11,240
Of course I will.

574
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,950
If you do something for me.

575
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:16,490
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

576
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,660
I would like to use your
membership at the Balboa Club.

577
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,420
The girl
I've been telling you about--

578
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,830
she likes nice things, and
if everything goes well tonight,

579
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,750
I think I may want
to take her out

580
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:25,750
for a nice dinner.

581
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,760
You really like this girl?

582
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,920
- She's Tracey.
- Oh.

583
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:33,180
Fat Tracey
or thin Tracey at the end?

584
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,300
I think, just on this,
you owe me the membership.

585
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,760
You know,
we're kind of maxed out

586
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,930
at the club,
but if you show them my card,

587
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:43,650
I'm sure they won't turn you
away at the door.

588
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:45,730
You'd do this for me?

589
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:47,230
I will if you...

590
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,740
- Yeah, sure, fine.
- Yeah?

591
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,990
Yeah, I'll talk to him
about the wall.

592
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:54,070
- Good. -I mean,
I want to change politics.

593
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,410
- Great.
- What's in it for me?

594
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:58,200
So not completely change them?

595
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,410
What do you want?

596
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:00,660
Well, actually

597
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,120
I want you to talk
to that warden guy

598
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,000
about getting my boyfriend out

599
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,460
'cause I really don't think
Herbert's gonna help with that.

600
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,420
Well, I have a script notes call
with him on Tuesday.

601
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:11,970
- Yeah, I'll talk to Warden
Gentles. -Great, thank you.

602
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:13,340
This is good.

603
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,220
- Of course.
- Glad we ran into each other.

604
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,510
If you do something for me.

605
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,890
I'm making this movie and I need
everybody's rights.

606
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:21,060
<i>And that's how Lindsay agreed</i>

607
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,640
<i>- to give Michael her rights for</i>
<i>his movie.</i>-I'll do it. -Great.

608
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:24,980
Thanks.

609
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,560
That's it.

610
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,520
<i>But it shouldn't have been</i>

611
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:30,780
<i>because he should have asked</i>
<i>for help getting into a club</i>

612
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:33,530
<i>he was about to discover</i>
<i>was members only.</i>

613
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:35,280
- This is a membership place,
huh? -It is,

614
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,910
- yes, members only. -Yeah,
I'm meeting my son up there.

615
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:39,240
Maybe he's already up there.
Could you maybe page him

616
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:41,500
- up there?<i>-And when</i>
<i>the page proved fruitless...</i>

617
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:43,540
If you'd like
to have a seat and wait...

618
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:46,290
You're gonna make me look like
a big shot in front of my son.

619
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:47,540
<i>And when the page</i>
<i>proved fruitless,</i>

620
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:50,130
<i>Michael decided to head</i>
<i>George Michael off</i>

621
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:53,380
<i>before he could get to the</i>
<i>club's lobby with a small lie.</i>

622
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,970
Hey, buddy, it's Dad.

623
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:58,140
Um, I am having real trouble
getting up there.

624
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,640
Uh, this traffic
is unbelievable.

625
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,640
<i>Which led</i>
<i>to a slightly bigger lie...</i>

626
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:06,060
We got a light aircraft right
in the middle of the freeway.

627
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,060
- You know?-<i>... and then some</i>
<i>effort to make it foolproof.</i>

628
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:10,650
Um, and, uh, the kicker
is that there's no news crew.

629
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:13,940
I mean, I guess they can't get
in either 'cause of the traffic,

630
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:15,820
so no one's going
to be able to see this.

631
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:16,910
<i>But perhaps,</i>

632
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,740
<i>had Michael not have lied,</i>

633
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:21,540
<i>he wouldn't have felt</i>
<i>suspicious when, moments later,</i>

634
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,290
<i>- he received a return call</i>
<i>from his son...</i>-You know what?

635
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:25,250
I bet we're sitting
in the exact same traffic.

636
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:28,210
- This is a mess.-<i>... canceling</i>
<i>the get-together entirely.</i>

637
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:31,000
Oh, God, they're forcing us off.
Oh, they're closing the lanes.

638
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:33,130
<i>Meanwhile,</i>
<i>in Herbert's hotel room,</i>

639
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:34,710
<i>Lindsay was worried she was</i>

640
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,050
<i>too quickly abandoning</i>
<i>her principles.</i>

641
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:39,180
Wait... I can't do this

642
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:42,520
unless you promise
to be against the wall.

643
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,430
What the hell?

644
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,690
It's better for my back anyway.

645
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:46,890
Thank you.

646
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,480
<i>Although technically</i>

647
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,520
<i>that was one</i>
<i>of Michael's principles.</i>

648
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:51,570
<i>Well...</i>

649
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:53,400
That was so not quick.

650
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,440
Well, I paid for six hours.

651
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:57,150
I want to get my money's worth.

652
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,740
Imagine what would have happened
if you had the room

653
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,070
for the whole night.

654
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,660
Oh, I got it
for the whole month.

655
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,700
You crack me up.

656
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,580
God, can you believe
this is happening?

657
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,920
I mean, we're such opposites
and yet we're so in synch.

658
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,960
- It's like we finish
each other's... -Sandwiches?

659
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,460
What's the point of raising
funds if I'm eating sandwiches?

660
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,880
I got something for you.

661
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,970
Oh, really?

662
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:23,060
<i>And perhaps it was</i>
<i>the heart that made her wonder</i>

663
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:27,060
<i>if Herbert was the Love the</i>
<i>Four Seasons shaman spoke of.</i>

664
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,440
When love is near,
your heart will be happy.

665
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,650
<i>This way</i>

666
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:34,900
you'll always have a little Love
near your heart.

667
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:39,110
- Aah, Jesus Christ!
- Oh!

668
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:40,410
- I'm sorry.
- Why would you do that?

669
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:42,120
No, I thought it was cute,
I saw it in a movie.

670
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,280
- Okay?
- Okay, okay, great, thank you.

671
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:44,870
Oh, I feel so special.

672
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:46,120
You are special.

673
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,910
<i>Lindsay wasn't special,</i>

674
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,750
<i>but he'd gotten</i>
<i>the necklaces on special.</i>

675
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:52,170
<i>So, when can I see you</i>

676
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:53,880
- again?
- The only way

677
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,960
we can see each other is
if you work for my campaign.

678
00:23:57,010 --> 00:24:00,590
You are going to be
my key advisor.

679
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,140
<i>She would be enacting</i>
<i>social change after all.</i>

680
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,720
I would like that very much.

681
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:07,020
She's going to need a key
to my room,

682
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:10,100
and I'd advise you to use it
when I call you.

683
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:15,270
<i>Since Herbert couldn't</i>
<i>officially spend money</i>

684
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,940
<i>on Lindsay, and Lindsay</i>
<i>hadn't told Herbert</i>

685
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,860
<i>- who she really was...</i>
- Uh, why don't you go

686
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,530
- make the rounds, and, uh,
I'll get us checked in. -Okay.

687
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:22,070
<i>...Lindsay had to pay</i>
<i>for dinner</i>

688
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,740
<i>- the way she always had...</i>
- Uh, Bluth.

689
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:26,080
- I made a reservation.
<i>- ...by secretly putting it</i>

690
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,620
<i>- on her family tab.</i>
- Hi-lo. Nice to meet you.

691
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,200
Oh, I'm sorry,
the Bluths have been seated.

692
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:31,040
<i>But she wasn't the only Bluth</i>

693
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,710
<i>pretending to be something</i>
<i>they weren't that night.</i>

694
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:35,750
Who's the cheap redhead?

695
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,340
Well, hello.

696
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,720
Hello.

697
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,920
Indeed.

698
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:43,260
Look at you.
What are you doing here?

699
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,930
I need the membership. I'm
taking my boss out to dinner.

700
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:47,850
It's too late. I already made
a deal with Dad for it.

701
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:50,140
This is why I had to ask you
for the in with Herbert Love.

702
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,100
Exactly, and that's why
you are leaving,

703
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,060
and I'm going to stay because
I'm the one who did the favor.

704
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,980
I got Love against the wall.
Plus I've got to impress him.

705
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:58,110
He's making me part
of his campaign.

706
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:59,860
I'm sorry, there seems
to have been a mix-up.

707
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,570
- A merry one.
- Oh.

708
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:04,200
A merry one. I already paid you
back for the favor when

709
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,280
I talked to the warden about
getting Marky out of prison.

710
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:07,700
Oh, God, not now.

711
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,410
- When?
- I don't know, but listen.

712
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:11,000
I haven't been on a date
in a very, very long time,

713
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,500
and she's already going out
with Ron Howard

714
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,870
so I need to impress her.

715
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,580
<i>Actually,</i>
<i>it was Ron's daughter,</i>

716
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:17,170
<i>but Michael still didn't</i>
<i>know that.</i>

717
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:19,550
Great to see you.
And you look so good.

718
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:20,800
So do you.
I do hate the campaign,

719
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,050
okay, but I'm changing him.

720
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:24,390
I'm his key advisor.

721
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:26,090
<i>Although without an office,</i>

722
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:28,560
<i>she was forced to advise him</i>
<i>in the back of his limo.</i>

723
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,020
<i>And soon she was advising him</i>
<i>all over town.</i>

724
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,770
<i>And he respect me for it.</i>

725
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:34,350
He respects me for who I am.

726
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,100
So does mine.
Listen, we'll share it, okay?

727
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:37,820
- Okay.
- Got it? Great.

728
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,730
Oh! My name
is Cindy Featherbottom.

729
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:42,070
Right. Oh, and I-I used to be
a real estate tycoon,

730
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,900
now I'm an impressive producer.
Got it?

731
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,200
- Got it.
- Eat light.

732
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,200
This is my date.
This is Rebel Alley.

733
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,950
Oh, and my boss, Herbert Love.

734
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:52,160
- Hi-lo.
- Hi-lo?

735
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,080
Just like your plan
to hurt the poor.

736
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,830
I thought that was about
neglecting the poor.

737
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,000
I guess the special tonight
is red snapper.

738
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,050
How do you know this woman?

739
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:06,590
Uh, she is... um...

740
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,310
I just, I mean...

741
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:12,140
- High school.
- Brother and sister.

742
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,770
We can't be brother-sister--
she knows about the family.

743
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:15,810
- We don't.
- Just met.

744
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:17,610
Yeah, so, but let's eat.

745
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:19,310
<i>And that's how Lindsay</i>
<i>found herself</i>

746
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,740
<i>on a very awkward double date</i>
<i>with her brother.</i>

747
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:25,740
Is everybody's food as delicious
as my side salad?

748
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,910
<i>And a couple of glasses</i>
<i>of white wine in,</i>

749
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:30,660
<i>Rebel started to espouse</i>
<i>her liberal agenda.</i>

750
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,660
It's just a little hard to sit
two feet away from someone

751
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,290
who doesn't believe in paying
for a woman's contraception.

752
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:38,380
Well, to be fair, no,
he does pay for the room.

753
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:41,210
Is there anything better than
the great American scallop?

754
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:43,460
Look how he changes the subject.

755
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:45,800
Aren't you glad your teenager's
not here to see this?

756
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,220
You have a teenager?

757
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,390
I'm a movie prod...

758
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:51,310
Movie producer.

759
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:53,720
Producing a movie right now--
Rebel's in it

760
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:56,060
- for Imagine Entertainment.
- Oh!

761
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,980
Is that Ron Howard's company?

762
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,770
- Uh, yeah.
- Yes.

763
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:02,110
I don't want to be the one
to say it, but I hate that guy.

764
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:04,980
He's just another Hollywood
liberal big shot.

765
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:07,360
Oh. There are a lot of those
Ron Howards out there

766
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,950
that do abuse their power,

767
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:11,580
but I will tell you, sir,
that I do not do that.

768
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:15,450
Well, don't you have to have
power to abuse the power?

769
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,170
Um, I am not going to sit here
and defend Ron Howard

770
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:21,960
to someone who's never achieved
half of what he's achieved.

771
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,380
Are you saying that to him
or to me?

772
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,630
I forgot how touchy

773
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:26,210
these Hollywood people can be.

774
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:29,300
Oh, I'm not. I'm not.
Are you saying that I am?

775
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,800
Maybe Ron Howard is,
but I-I mean, I don't know.

776
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:33,010
But I'm not.
And I am also not

777
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:34,850
one of those Beverly Hills
billionaires

778
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:36,390
who can't go two minutes without
putting his phone to his...

779
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:40,020
I got to take this.
Hold on one second. Hello?

780
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,610
Hey, George Michael.
You stuck in traffic, pal?

781
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:44,860
No, I just feel terrible
that we couldn't get together

782
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,780
the other night and, uh,
I miss you, you know.

783
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,820
But I'm free all night
if you wanted...

784
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,530
- Well... listen, I-I...<i>-But</i>
<i>Michael was still stinging...</i>

785
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:52,410
I'm in the middle
of a film meeting...

786
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:54,120
<i>...over his son not making it</i>
<i>to the Ealing Club...</i>

787
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,120
I've got these people in
politics involved and I just...

788
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:00,420
You know, I can't get away
this time, you know. Maybe...

789
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:03,630
<i>...even though Michael</i>
<i>had lied to him about it first.</i>

790
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:05,040
You know, just,
I'm a super busy guy.

791
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:06,710
<i>- And back at the table...</i>
- So...

792
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,720
I can't believe that a woman
would support this guy.

793
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,550
<i>...Lindsay found herself</i>
<i>torn...</i>

794
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:13,890
And I assume by being with him,
you just parrot his values.

795
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:16,220
<i>- ...between who she was</i>
<i>with...</i>-I don't appreciate you

796
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,520
saying that, okay?

797
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,350
I have my own values, Rebel,

798
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:21,690
and believe it or not, they're
closer to yours than you think.

799
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:23,360
<i>...and who she wanted to be.</i>

800
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,730
'Cause I do appreciate
you saying that.

801
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:28,490
But what do I know? I'm just
some shallow Hollywood...

802
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:30,820
Oh, God, I've got to get this.

803
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:33,070
It could be my agent.
Hello?

804
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:35,450
Now that is one redhead

805
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:37,660
I do not want to have
sexual relations with.

806
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,870
- Well...
- So... are we having dessert?

807
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,670
- No.
- No. Uh-uh.

808
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:45,250
Well, I don't want to be the one
to say it,

809
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:47,130
but if we are not going
to have dessert,

810
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:50,130
- then I think I am going
to leave. -Oh, no.

811
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:52,760
But-but we're going to discuss
those new positions tonight.

812
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,850
Wasn't that the plan?

813
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:57,010
I think the best position for me
to be in tonight

814
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,770
is with my wife,

815
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:01,180
and tomorrow I'm taking my wife
and children

816
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:04,270
to see the beautiful
American ocean.

817
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:12,740
<i>Lindsay started rethinking</i>
<i>her new life and that's when</i>

818
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,870
<i>she ran into the man</i>
<i>from her old one.</i>

819
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:17,450
- Marky?
- Lindsay?

820
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:19,040
- Oh, Lindsay.
- Marky.

821
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,000
I did it.
I beat the system.

822
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,370
I got out my way.

823
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:25,500
I thought my brother asked
Warden Gentles

824
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,750
- to get you out.
- No, I mean from the Dumpster.

825
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,460
You wouldn't believe the
scallops they're throwing

826
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,920
away here, but I got out
of that Dumpster my way.

827
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,840
I've really missed you.

828
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,550
Yeah, I missed you, too.

829
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,060
I feel like I really lost my way
for a while.

830
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,720
Me, too.
It's almost like

831
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:43,980
maybe we shouldn't skip town
after this next one.

832
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,400
Next one? Another paint bomb?

833
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,110
No, a real one.

834
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:51,070
On the Cinco de Cuatro,
Love's boat is going to...

835
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:53,780
- Sink-o.
- ...go into the... Yes, sink-o.

836
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,200
See, the coast guard is going
to be busy that night,

837
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,870
so after it's done, we slip away

838
00:29:56,910 --> 00:30:00,040
and make our way down to Mexico
and reunite with Mom.

839
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,660
I just have to find a boat
that won't get chorizo

840
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,120
- caught in the propeller.
<i>- Lindsay was torn.</i>

841
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,170
<i>Her head was with Marky...</i>

842
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:08,920
<i>but it was Love who was close</i>
<i>to her heart.</i>

843
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,920
<i>So the next night at Cinco,</i>
<i>she felt she had no choice</i>

844
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:15,090
<i>- but to betray one</i>
- Herbert.

845
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:16,970
<i>- to protect the other.</i>
- Hi. Um, listen.

846
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:20,310
I'm here undercover because
I have some inside information

847
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:22,560
that you really need
to know about.

848
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,100
<i>But as it turned out,</i>
<i>Herbert had</i>

849
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:26,730
<i>some undercover information</i>
<i>for her, too.</i>

850
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:29,270
I cannot be under the covers
with you anymore.

851
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:31,030
It's over between us.

852
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:34,240
My wife found out and I told her
there was nothing emotional,

853
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,490
that you were just a prostitute.

854
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:38,280
- I'm not a prostitute.
- Oh, I know, I know.

855
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,870
The point is, we are through.

856
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:41,120
Here's a little
severance package

857
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,830
for servicing my package.

858
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:45,660
<i>Lindsay tried to throw</i>
<i>the money in his face,</i>

859
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:48,580
<i>but she didn't have</i>
<i>the muscle memory for it.</i>

860
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:51,340
- She's keeping it.
- Oh, good.

861
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,010
And don't forget to vote.

862
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:54,510
This isn't over.

863
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:56,840
I'm not some taco
you can throw into the bay.

864
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,680
<i>- Lindsay wanted to get back</i>
- I can't do this.

865
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,180
<i>at Love...</i>

866
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,980
<i>but not by blowing him up</i>

867
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:09,520
<i>and heading to Mexico to be</i>
<i>with Marky's awful mother.</i>

868
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:14,110
<i>And that's when she ran into</i>
<i>her own awful mother.</i>

869
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:16,440
Mom. What are you doing here?

870
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:18,490
Lindsay.
I thought you were a hooker.

871
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:20,570
- Again.
- It's a wig.

872
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,120
No one recognizes me in it.

873
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,700
Oh, I recognized you.

874
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,410
Let me rephrase that
more kindly.

875
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:29,250
I hear you're hooking now
with Herbert Love.

876
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:30,920
- It's called hooking up.
- Oh.

877
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,050
And, yeah,
I got a little sidetracked,

878
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:35,590
but I know who I am now.

879
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:37,420
I'm back to being
severely liberal.

880
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:38,970
Well, like I said,

881
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:40,720
the one time you were nice
enough to visit me,

882
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,550
you are who you are--

883
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,720
a blonde, waspy
Orange County princess

884
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,850
who doesn't care about anything
but herself

885
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:48,770
and that's okay.

886
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:50,850
Ah, sarcasm.

887
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:55,280
No, I'm a Bluth
and so are you.

888
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:58,030
You really know
how to twist the knife.

889
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:00,320
But you are right about
one thing.

890
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,950
<i>Lindsay was done</i>
<i>pretending to be red.</i>

891
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:04,620
I don't need this anymore.

892
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,080
<i>And she decided the best way</i>
<i>to get back</i>

893
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,540
<i>at her mother</i>
<i>and Herbert Love</i>

894
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:11,330
<i>was by working</i>
<i>for their mutual rival.</i>

895
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:14,170
Lucille 2.
I've got great news.

896
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:17,460
I'm finally available to become
your campaign manager.

897
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:19,130
Oh, that's lovely, dear.

898
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:22,510
But I found someone
more qualified than you.

899
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:24,010
Hello, Lindsay.

900
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:26,390
Sally.

901
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:27,810
<i>It was Sally Sitwell, a woman</i>

902
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:29,060
<i>who'd long been</i>
<i>Lindsay's rival.</i>

903
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,390
- It's been a while.
- Mm.

904
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,690
How is she more qualified
than me?

905
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:35,230
She has integrity.

906
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:36,440
And look at this hair.

907
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,240
Look at this beautiful,
long hair.

908
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:41,660
I made you a banner.

909
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,450
Look, I can really help
this campaign.

910
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:45,830
You already have,
more than you know.

911
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:49,500
- Now, give her a little
show-and-tell. -Mm.

912
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,750
Show-and-tell?

913
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:52,870
Oh, she just means
these photos

914
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,920
of Herbert Love
with a mystery redhead

915
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,590
he's cheating on his wife with.

916
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:59,170
Who took these?

917
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,920
The first two were taken
by the security camera

918
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:03,090
in the Albertsons parking lot.

919
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:06,180
And the third was left in the
photo booth at the Ealing Club.

920
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:09,060
- God, that was a photo booth?
- Mm-hmm.

921
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,430
No one can know about this.

922
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,390
Oh, I'm afraid
they're going to.

923
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,770
Lucille has copies-- she wants
to go viral with this.

924
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,190
Herbert Love with his hooker?

925
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:20,190
She'll win for sure.

926
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,700
I can't let her do that.

927
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:24,870
I don't think you can stop her.

928
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:26,950
Anyway, it was so great
running into you again.

929
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:28,790
- Mwah!
<i>- Lindsay was horrified</i>

930
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:30,910
<i>that the world would view her</i>

931
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:32,580
<i>- as Love's prostitute.</i>
- Vote for Love. Vote for Love.

932
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,420
<i>And then Lindsay ran into</i>
<i>someone else</i>

933
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,080
<i>- who was looking for Love.</i>
- David. -Who are you?

934
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:37,290
I'm Cindy Featherbottom.

935
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,920
I've been looking for you.

936
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,920
Love's gone missing
and I've got to find someone

937
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,590
to jump onto that stage
and to show everyone here

938
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:47,010
that we are the party
that has complete con-con...

939
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:48,850
Complete con-con-con...

940
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:50,390
- con-con... Complete...
- ...trol?

941
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:51,980
Giant. ...trol.

942
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:54,140
<i>And that's when Lindsay</i>
<i>found an opportunity...</i>

943
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:56,560
- I'll do it.
<i>- to put a spin on the looming</i>

944
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,230
<i>- photos scandal.</i>-Oh, my God,
thank you, thank you.

945
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:00,360
And I'm so sorry about
that giant crack earlier.

946
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:04,700
Okay, raise the mics, everybody!
New speaker!

947
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,200
<i>So, like many before her,</i>

948
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,120
<i>Lindsay would accuse</i>
<i>Herbert Love...</i>

949
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,790
Can I have everyone's attention?

950
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:13,410
<i>...of sexual harassment.</i>

951
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:16,210
I am Herbert Love's
"key advisor."

952
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,960
Uh, thank you, but...

953
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,590
<i>But first she had to turn</i>
<i>his supporters against him.</i>

954
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:23,670
Listen, I have a few things
I'd like to tell you

955
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,380
about Herbert Love.

956
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:28,180
Love wants to put up a wall.

957
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:29,850
No, no.

958
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:32,350
I mean, not just any wall.

959
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:35,890
A wall to keep out the Mexicans.

960
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:40,270
Oh, wow,
what a great crowd, uh...

961
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,520
<i>And that's when</i>
<i>the blowback began.</i>

962
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:44,110
Checkmate!

963
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:46,360
But no, you don't understand.

964
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:48,410
He wants to separate...

965
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:50,160
Oh!

966
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,740
<i>- Viva Méjico.</i>
- That's my necklace.

967
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,790
What-what's going on?

968
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:01,130
The marauders, lady,
a bunch of young Mexicans--

969
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:02,340
they're taking over
Cinco de Cuatro.

970
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,130
They don't find it funny
anymore.

971
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:07,470
But that was my necklace.
I mean... God.

972
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:10,510
They don't belong here,
we belong here.

973
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:17,480
I mean,
someone should put up a wall.

974
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,100
<i>But that's when Lindsay</i>
<i>found herself</i>

975
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,650
<i>- saying this...</i>
- Yeah.

976
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:22,770
We should put up a wall.

977
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:26,400
Put up this wall.

978
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:29,700
Put... up... this wall.

979
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:33,490
Put up this wall!

980
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:35,700
<i>...which was originally</i>
<i>her mother's idea.</i>

981
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:39,000
<i>Although it was horrible news</i>
<i>for her father.</i>

982
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,170
- Put up this wall!
<i>- And that's when Lindsay</i>

983
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:43,210
<i>found out who she really was.</i>

984
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:48,340
My name is Lindsay Bluth,
and this is who I am.

985
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,760
<i>A Bluth, just like her mother.</i>

986
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,510
She's a game changer.

987
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,150
<i>Herbert Love is discovered</i>
<i>in a coma.</i>

988
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:03,110
They think it happened
during the blowback.

989
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:05,030
They found him behind
the Kick a Goat.

990
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:08,200
The doctors say he may come out
of it in a week to ten years.

991
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,780
So I have one question for you.

992
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,570
- Would you consider...
- Yes.

993
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:13,620
- Would you consider... -Yes.

994
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,410
- Would you consider...
- Yes.

995
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:17,540
Would you consider running
in his place?

996
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,420
- Yes.
- Fantastic.

997
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,210
Sweetheart,
could you work his thumb?

998
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:24,670
<i>And she even gets</i>
<i>Herbert's endorsement.</i>

999
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:26,340
<i>And Annyong tries to stick</i>

1000
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:28,590
<i>the Bluth family</i>
<i>for a tomato juice</i>

1001
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:30,760
<i>that costs him $700</i>

1002
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,350
<i>and ultimately his freedom.</i>

1003
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:35,180
<i>Good-bye, Annyong.</i>
