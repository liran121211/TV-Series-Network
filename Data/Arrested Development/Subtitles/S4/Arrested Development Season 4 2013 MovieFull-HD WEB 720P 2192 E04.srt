1
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:12,980
Michael Bluth
was starting a new job

2
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,930
when he received a call
from attorney Barry Zuckerkorn.

3
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:17,680
Hello. Michael Bluth,
residential complexes.

4
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,040
Take a picture of this!

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:19,840
Hey, Michael.

6
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:21,890
- You're in real estate again?
- Sort of.

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,350
Michael had tried
to leave real estate behind

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,900
and get a job
in the high-tech sector.

9
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,190
However...

10
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,280
I will tell you
that in my last position,

11
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,240
I had a company car provision.

12
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,740
I think we may have something
that can get you a car.

13
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,320
- Hey, Gare-Bear?
- Yeah?

14
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,070
I think we got an ostrich.

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,700
- Oh, God, grab him.
- What is it?

16
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:42,080
Now, with this car,
you may get some stares.

17
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,040
I'm used to a car
with some stairs.

18
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,790
Albeit one that had trouble

19
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:49,710
negotiating
low-hanging obstacles.

20
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:56,470
Which is why
he'd parted with it.

21
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:58,050
I'm actually working
in high tech,

22
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,720
but it does collide
with real estate.

23
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,730
This is going to be low.

24
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,060
Ah, I hooked it.

25
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,100
Michael was driving a car

26
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,440
from a company that shows

27
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,770
every private residence
in the country.

28
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:11,980
But it's also a company
that won't let us

29
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,110
show the car
that takes those pictures.

30
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,780
In fairness to them,
it is their property.

31
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,960
If you want to know
what the company is...

32
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:21,710
Save it. We're just
going to blur it anyway.

33
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:22,910
...all you have to do is...

34
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:23,660
"something" it.

35
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,020
Barry, you still there?

36
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,480
So I got a really
interesting call

37
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,650
from Ron Howard, of all people.

38
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,360
He's directing now, apparently,

39
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,020
and wants to meet you
at his office

40
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,480
in-- get this-- Beverly Hills.

41
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:36,860
Why does Ron How...

42
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,900
Why does Ron Howard want
to meet with me?

43
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:40,780
Oh, I didn't know. His office
didn't say, and if you

44
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,740
don't mind, I'm a little busy
with a case of my own.

45
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,700
Did you get
any other information?

46
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,000
Apparently, he directed
a movie called Cocoon.

47
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,580
Sorry. I was unclear

48
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,460
about why he wants
to meet with me.

49
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,130
I don't know. You want me to
tell him to go  himself?

50
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,130
I can tell Ron Howard
to go  himself.

51
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:55,880
Tell him to shove it
up his.

52
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,170
I just can't do it now

53
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,010
because I'm in front of a jury.

54
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:00,510
Barry, I will meet with him.

55
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,970
You're in front of a jury
right now?

56
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:03,850
Oh, and the looks I'm getting.
Got to go.

57
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,720
Sorry, everybody.
I'm an attorney, too.

58
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,850
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

59
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,600
I'd like the defendant
to reach over the school gate,

60
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,020
open it from the inside

61
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,980
and enter the school
property, please.

62
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,110
I can't reach it.
I can't reach the knob.

63
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,860
Why is that,
Mr. Zuckerkorn?

64
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,820
- I'm not tall enough.
- You're not tall enough.

65
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,780
I can't reach the chotchie.

66
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,490
Hey, should I try tippy-toe?

67
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:26,040
Look, I'm on tippy-toes.

68
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,000
If he can't reach,
this trial's a breach.

69
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,580
Ooh, and that's what
we call a Law Bomb.

70
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,960
That's a low blow, Loblaw.

71
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,210
A Bob Loblaw Law Bomb.

72
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,880
Now the story

73
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,670
of a wealthy family
who lost everything

74
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,840
and the one son
who had no choice

75
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,970
but to keep them all together.

76
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,100
It's...

77
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:56,020
Michael drove to the
North American headquarters

78
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,690
of Imagine Entertainment,

79
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:00,490
the modest television
and streaming colossus

80
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,860
of Brian Grazer and Ron Howard.

81
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:06,490
And got his first taste
of how cruel Hollywood can be.

82
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,410
That's not very nice.

83
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,750
"Ankles" means "leaves"
in Variety, Michael.

84
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,870
Kitty Sanchez.
What are you doing here?

85
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,580
I work here. I'm a "D" girl.

86
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,210
No, I don't want to see them.

87
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,090
I'm not going to show you
my , you pig.

88
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,760
It means "development."

89
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,510
I'm a movie executive.
I work for Ron Howard now.

90
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:27,510
And she'd proven
as loyal to him as she was

91
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,060
to her former boss,
Michael's father.

92
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,980
But without the
quote, unquote "benefits."

93
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,730
Also, Imagine provided
no health benefits.

94
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:37,650
Great for you.
How'd you get this job?

95
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:40,650
Women can be movie executives,
you pig. I knew people.

96
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,990
You're probably going to call me
a pig for this, too,

97
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,610
but are you sure that
you meant to say "knew"?

98
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,070
She did.

99
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,800
The only thing at Imagine
that Kitty blew

100
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:51,660
was smoke up the skirt
of the young woman

101
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,540
who hired her,
Michael's niece, Maeby,

102
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,880
who was then working
as a film executive.

103
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,790
My first project
is about my family.

104
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,130
Ooh!

105
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:01,170
Yeah, which is why I thought
you'd be a perfect assistant--

106
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,090
because you know where
all the bodies are buried.

107
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:04,840
And I even helped
bury some of them.

108
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,090
Maeby was only 17 at the time.

109
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,800
Also, um, can you buy me booze?

110
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,060
Totally.

111
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,100
Whatever else, too.

112
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,810
'Cause I can get you smack
or hash or Special K...

113
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:18,690
Unfortunately,
when Maeby was shooting

114
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:23,530
out of town on a picture,
Kitty saw to it...

115
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:25,570
She didn't even get releases
from her family.

116
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:27,110
that Maeby's was one
of the bodies that was buried.

117
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,910
And I begged her to.

118
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,040
And the project got thrown
on the back burner.

119
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,830
Do you have any idea
why Ron Howard wants to see me?

120
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:36,170
Believe me, if I could
think like Ron Howard,

121
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,880
I'd own the second largest
building in Beverly Hills.

122
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,840
Only Jerry Bruckheimer's
building

123
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,590
was technically taller.

124
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,130
But who wants to be
south of Wilshire?

125
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:45,970
Mr. Howard will see you now.

126
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:48,260
- Oh, great.
- I'll take you to the private elevator.

127
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,180
- Thanks.
- Ooh! Going to meet the big man himself.

128
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,310
But first, Michael would have
to pass a few little Rons.

129
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,600
Michael Bluth.

130
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,940
- Hey.
- Hey, nice try, mister.

131
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,940
We're never going
to beat the original.

132
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,520
- Well, that's what I've been saying.
- Hi. Hey.

133
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,150
- Oh, Michael. Hey, thanks
for coming down. - How are you?

134
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,690
- Pleasure to meet you.
- I'm just finishing up

135
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,990
casting this
Andy Griffith Show thing.

136
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,200
Okay. Yeah.

137
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,610
Hang on a second.

138
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,020
You guys finally
making that movie?

139
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,870
I've been reading about it
for, like, 40 years.

140
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,740
Well, it's not a done deal yet,

141
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,310
- but I want to talk about you.
- Yeah.

142
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:17,000
Hey, let's go inside the LEM.

143
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,000
- You want to?
- Wow. Is this the one

144
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,210
that landed on the moon?

145
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,590
On a soundstage.

146
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,090
Oh, right, from Apollo 13.

147
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,800
No, no, 1969.

148
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,720
I'll tell you about it
inside the LEM.

149
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,260
It's soundproof in there.

150
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,180
And it's a national secret.

151
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,890
So, NASA did go to the moon
in '71.

152
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,680
That one was real.

153
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,980
But in '69, they weren't ready,

154
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,850
so they faked the whole thing
on the soundstage of Gentle Ben.

155
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,980
- Boy.
- Me and my brother,

156
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,690
we hid up in the rafters.

157
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:45,110
- We seen the whole thing.
- Ah.

158
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,900
But I want to talk to
you about something.

159
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,610
Okay.

160
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:51,070
For the last year, I've
been going to Phoenix.

161
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,240
Whoa, whoa. Hang on, now.

162
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,740
Are you kidding me?

163
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,410
I'm a... I'm a Phoenix.

164
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:58,830
I've-I've never... I've never
met anyone else in person

165
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,150
that, uh...
that also goes there.

166
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,790
That's amazing.

167
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:04,040
I guess that's the downside
of going to college online, huh?

168
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:06,130
Well, I... I just got
a sick aunt down there.

169
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,300
- Oh, I see.
- But on the last flight,

170
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,090
I was flipping
through the magazine,

171
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:11,890
- and I... I saw something.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

172
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,720
Not-not...
not the begging photo.

173
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,350
Now, I don't think
you know this about me,

174
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:18,180
but most of my movies are based

175
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,270
on still photographs
that I find truly inspiring.

176
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,810
It was true.

177
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,770
Splash was based
on what turned out

178
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,860
to be a counterfeit Hockney

179
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,230
that Brian talked Ron
into buying.

180
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,700
The Da Vinci Code
was from this photo.

181
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,410
You know Willow?

182
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:36,660
That was from a Soft 'n Snuggly
coupon I got in the mail.

183
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,700
But a man who is
passionate enough

184
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,120
to beg, well, that's a character

185
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:43,380
whose story we really want
to see.

186
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,210
- Really?
- Plus I've been dying to figure out

187
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,250
a way to do something
about the market crash

188
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,300
ever since my partner,
Brian Grazer, was tipped off

189
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,010
that it was three months
away from happening.

190
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,260
What's that?

191
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,090
But I never had a face
to put on it.

192
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,050
Until now. You.

193
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,100
Your wife is dying.

194
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,850
You're trying to hold
your family together.

195
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,690
Oh, gosh, no, no, no.

196
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:04,860
My wife died years before
any... any of this.

197
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,940
Oh, gee.

198
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:11,110
I think it's a lot more fun
if we see her die.

199
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,820
- That is fun.
- And by the way,

200
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,070
then it's a fantastic part
for a leading lady.

201
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,830
In fact, my girl Rebel
would be great in that part.

202
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,080
Your girl?

203
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,290
Rebel Alley.

204
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:22,410
She's an actress.
You know her.

205
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,790
He didn't.

206
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,130
I do.
Yes, of course I do.

207
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,670
Your girl, huh?

208
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,960
Well, we kind of like
to keep that quiet.

209
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,340
Michael assumed
that by "my girl,"

210
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,970
Ron was referring
to his mistress...

211
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:34,130
I can see why you're
telling me in the LEM, huh?

212
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,890
...but Ron was actually
talking about his daughter.

213
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:41,060
You probably think I'm terrible
for even mentioning her to you.

214
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,980
Oh, no, no,
I'm-I'm not one to judge.

215
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,230
I'm sure you've all got girls
up here in Hollywood, huh?

216
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,400
Brian's got two boys.

217
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,240
I think you're a natural
and it could be a great movie.

218
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,820
You know, and-and
it's a real chance

219
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,110
to show you guys off, too.

220
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,370
Us guys?

221
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:58,830
Well, it's about
the whole family.

222
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,330
Them?

223
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:01,870
We're going to need
everybody's signature

224
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:04,750
on these releases in order
to make this story.

225
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,250
Although the real
heartbeat of this thing

226
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,750
is the father-son dynamic.

227
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,090
Yeah. You know, Ron,

228
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:11,000
I-I don't know if I can do this.

229
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,050
We're not in a great way
right now,

230
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:14,930
and-and it might not
be worth...

231
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:17,390
Michael, take a few of these
cards and really think about it.

232
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,390
- All right.
- Yeah, man, I got a tough meeting coming up now.

233
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:23,310
How do you tell Ed Harris
that he's simply not a Barney?

234
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:26,350
And while Ed was
getting some bad news,

235
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,190
Michael got some good news.

236
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,820
Excuse me.
Uh, is this a mistake?

237
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,110
Am I a producer?

238
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,360
It's one of the perks

239
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,990
of having a movie
made about you.

240
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,900
Huh.

241
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,200
Health plan is not
another one, by the way.

242
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,240
There's no health plan.

243
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,710
Michael had been given
an opportunity

244
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,830
to turn his life around,
and all he had to do

245
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,790
to make it happen was to get

246
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,670
- his family's signatures.
- ...the family signatures,

247
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:54,340
especially my father's.

248
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,760
Wow, sounds like your thing

249
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,090
went a lot better
than my thing.

250
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:59,890
Except I haven't spoken
to them for a long time.

251
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:03,100
I mean, since I...
well, since-since my mom...

252
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,730
Left?

253
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,350
Yeah, for prison, yeah.

254
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,850
You want to know what?

255
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,310
Frankly, I think Ron Howard

256
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,730
just wants to get a movie
for his girlfriend.

257
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,940
Oh, it sounds like Ron Howard
is casting with his.

258
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,780
Well...

259
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,740
it is hard to believe,
but I guess they've all got

260
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,070
their mistresses up here
in showbiz, you know.

261
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,870
It's like it's
their God-given...

262
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:25,000
Front?
No, right.

263
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,790
- No, right.
- Calm down, everybody, all right?

264
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:28,390
- I got it. I got it.
- You think my dad

265
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,130
would ever even go
for something like this?

266
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,420
You know, it's very hard
to get a signature out of him.

267
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,250
It's... it's like somebody
a long time ago said...

268
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,090
Hey, what if you never
signed anything

269
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:37,970
because you said you didn't
have a signature?

270
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,220
- Just like you, Pop.
- You... you don't have a signature?

271
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,850
No, and he's never
given me one card.

272
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:43,260
Not one birthday
card, which is why

273
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:44,680
his presents are
always money orders.

274
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,890
Right, Pop?

275
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:48,020
- I don't have a signature.
- Oh!

276
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,850
If you don't sign,
you will be fine.

277
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,230
Hey.

278
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,770
He's very smart.

279
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:54,480
He's very good.

280
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,110
Can you feel your hands?

281
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,110
I can't feel my pinky
or this one.

282
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,860
You know what, Barry?
I hear what you're saying.

283
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,780
I... My dad would never do
something like this for me.

284
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,330
I'm going to head back in,
and I'm going to...

285
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,160
I'm going to tell Ron Howard
to forget about it.

286
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,330
- Yeah, you're screwed.
Hey, do me a favor. - Yeah.

287
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:07,370
- Tell Ron Howard to go
- Okay.

288
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:08,970
- shove his...
- Bye-bye, Barry.

289
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,290
- Oh!
- Sorry. Whoops.

290
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:12,380
Whoa. Sorry.
That was my fault.

291
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,000
- No.
- I was looking at my phone.

292
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,250
It's not too embarrassing
walking around

293
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,880
with a bunch of photographs
of yourself.

294
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,760
Oh, well, looks like
it's part of your job, huh?

295
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,800
- You're an actress?
- No, I'm a narcissist.

296
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,260
Yeah, actually, "actress"
is an overstatement because...

297
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,850
Ugh. Thank you.

298
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,980
I was just sucking at
this audition I went on.

299
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,980
It was one of these ridiculous
meet-cute clichés,

300
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,110
where a guy and a girl
just, you know...

301
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,320
they bump into each
other, and they...

302
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,280
they fall in love.

303
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,900
God, you're handsome.

304
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:42,160
I got a...
maybe a lucky hair day.

305
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,490
You're the beautiful one.

306
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:46,330
You have beautiful eyes.

307
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:49,370
My deceased wife had red hair.

308
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:51,290
Yep, garbage like that.

309
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:53,290
And it's so unbelievable.

310
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:54,890
Like, they never get
each other's names.

311
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,920
Pretty stupid. Whoops. Gosh.

312
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,880
- Oh... oh! Ow!
- Oh! Are you okay?

313
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,320
- That really hurt.
- Ooh. You okay?

314
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,010
I wish I had done that
well in the audition.

315
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:05,430
Where's a movie producer
when you need one, right?

316
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,060
Well, it was really
nice to meet you.

317
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,560
Yes, you, too.

318
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,060
I'm a "moobie" producer.

319
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,440
Sorry. I'm a movie...

320
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,900
Here, I've got...

321
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,900
I've got proof here, huh?

322
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,270
- Oh, you are a movie producer.
- Yeah.

323
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,190
Yeah, there's a part
for a wife,

324
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:21,190
and you'd be perfect
for the movie.

325
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,280
Do you like Scottish music?

326
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,990
Uh, with the screeching horns
and the silly...

327
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,000
Yeah. I'm in a band.

328
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,830
I love it. It's great.

329
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,500
We're playing at the Ealing
Club tomorrow night, and...

330
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,540
maybe you could come and...
and just check it out.

331
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,540
Oh, yeah?
I don't even know what that is.

332
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,210
I should've... Sorry.

333
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,470
That's funny.
I should have said "where."

334
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,050
Of course, I know what it is.

335
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:44,630
No, it's on the top
of that building.

336
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,050
- Okay.
- But can you imagine driving that car?

337
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,350
No, I can't. No.

338
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:52,100
It wasn't until
Michael had walked

339
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,640
two blocks past the
California Pizza Kitchen

340
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:56,150
when this happened.

341
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,020
♪ Hey, I met a girl today ♪

342
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,230
♪ And her name is... ♪

343
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:03,570
So Michael went back
to find her

344
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:05,650
or, at the very least,
try looking for a head shot

345
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:08,120
- with her name on it.
- Nothing, huh?

346
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,030
She was super-pretty,
red hair...

347
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,200
But even without her name,

348
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,250
he knew his only chance
with her

349
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:14,080
was to be a real producer,
and that meant

350
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,540
getting a signature
from a father whose face

351
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,540
he hadn't seen in ages.

352
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,880
Oh, you're making me dizzy!

353
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,550
And that's when he
suddenly did.

354
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:22,550
We have
to keep this quiet!

355
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,340
Dad?

356
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:27,340
No, no.

357
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:29,390
- Hi.
- Don't say I'm down here.

358
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:31,470
- Right here.
- Hey.

359
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,390
What's going on?

360
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,020
I just came back to get, uh...

361
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,270
Don't acknowledge me.

362
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:38,060
...get some suits, you know,

363
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:40,320
so I can look like the uptight,

364
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,150
dishonest, cheating boob
that I am.

365
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:45,450
Well, I never said "boob."

366
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,530
Although you are in
the wrong Lucille's apartment,

367
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:49,950
so unless you're looking
for a Bob Mackie original,

368
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,490
could be some truth
to the cheating part.

369
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,160
Yeah, well, I was
in the desert,

370
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,540
and I've lost my
sense of direction.

371
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,180
Hey. Where you going?

372
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,420
Dad.

373
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,040
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

374
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:01,250
Listen.

375
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:03,000
You're getting divorced.

376
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:05,170
I am not one to judge.

377
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,090
Great to see you again.

378
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,100
The past is the past, and
things have worked out,

379
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,140
and I've met a
wonderful woman named...

380
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:15,560
Don't worry about that,
but I'm a movie producer now.

381
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,440
Unbelievable.

382
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,110
They're making a movie
out of my life.

383
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:22,150
The girl I met is perfect
to play my wife.

384
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,940
And it's... I don't know.

385
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,070
Can you believe it?
And I know what you're thinking:

386
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:28,360
- "Can you put me in it?"
- I don't care.

387
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,610
Do I have what I hope I've got?

388
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,070
Anybody who's getting
in the movie

389
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,620
needs to sign this.

390
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,450
It's a simple signature.

391
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,040
I think that everybody
needs to see

392
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,410
who the real George
Sr. is, don't you?

393
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:41,960
I think it would all depend
on how George Sr. was portrayed.

394
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,460
Well...

395
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:48,510
he is not the most
positive character, but...

396
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:51,470
you sign this, and I
don't see any reason

397
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:54,640
why we can't make him
seem very, very, uh...

398
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,430
uh, you know...

399
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:59,020
uh...

400
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,020
uh...

401
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,980
uh...

402
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,570
...nice.

403
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:12,450
- Go to hell.
- Huh?

404
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,490
Michael was actually relieved.

405
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:15,660
You go to hell.

406
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,580
He had no idea how he was

407
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,620
going to make
his father seem nice.

408
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,920
Michael Bluth
was starting his new life

409
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,960
as a producer in-- get this--
Beverly Hills

410
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:30,430
without the signature
he needed to make it happen.

411
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:33,050
Your office is only
one floor below Ron Howard's.

412
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:34,800
Oh, yeah?

413
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:37,810
Must be a pretty important
project to him, then, huh?

414
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:40,350
That's one possibility.

415
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,400
Watch your head.

416
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,310
Are these ceilings
a little lower?

417
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,110
Brian and Ron
wanted the ceiling

418
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,860
in their office to be
a few inches taller,

419
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,820
but, apparently, Bruckheimer
knows someone on city council

420
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,820
and they wouldn't let them
make the building taller.

421
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,410
So Ron said,
" you, Jerry,"

422
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,830
and he went lower
with his floor.

423
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,540
Everybody wins, huh?

424
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:01,000
- Here we are.
- Oh. That's me, huh?

425
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,380
Oh. Ceilings
are even lower in here.

426
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,290
Yeah, your office
is right below Brian's.

427
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,920
He wanted his ceiling

428
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,460
just a few inches
taller than Ron's.

429
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,510
- Okay.
- Some internal competition.

430
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,550
- Kind of like between us.
- Yeah.

431
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:16,970
- Wait, what?
- Well, you have a family to track down.

432
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:19,060
Yeah, I do.
Hey, speaking of that...

433
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,140
Kitty, is there... is there
a directory of actresses,

434
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,150
- with pictures in it, that I could...
- Wow.

435
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,110
Starting with the
casting couch already.

436
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,400
No, no, no, no.
Nothing like that.

437
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,980
I met... I met this
unbelievable woman

438
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,860
that would be perfect
for the part of my wife.

439
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,450
And even if she isn't, I'd love

440
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:33,990
to track her down, so...

441
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,820
an actual couch could
be useful, please.

442
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,030
Okay, you're funny.

443
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,280
This is Imagine Entertainment,

444
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:40,290
not the hot tub
at Bruckheimer Tower.

445
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:42,080
We make family movies,

446
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,580
you
pig.

447
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,830
- Okay.
- So, why don't you not worry

448
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,960
about casting your movie,
and instead just get

449
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,550
the rights to your family,
and, of course,

450
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:52,340
if you need any help at all,
I would love to help you.

451
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,180
- We like to pull together around here.
- Watch your back.

452
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,180
No, you watch your back, mister!

453
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,890
If you screw up
this project for me,

454
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,850
I will bury you
farther underground

455
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:02,060
than I did your illiterate
little niece!

456
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,890
Hi, guys.

457
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,100
With Michael's movie
in jeopardy

458
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:09,520
over the rights,
he decided to call in a favor.

459
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,280
You know, we're making a movie

460
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,900
about the family, and I thought,

461
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,200
"I wonder if Carl Weathers

462
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,820
would be willing
to help me out."

463
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,990
- Let me ask you this right up front.
- Okay.

464
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:20,450
Do you think
anybody would be upset

465
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:22,870
if one of these Crinch
dolls took a walk?

466
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:25,420
No, no, no, no, help yourself.

467
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,960
I know what you're thinking.

468
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,090
"What part
would I play in this?"

469
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:31,130
I figured you'd
want me to play me.

470
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:33,630
Well, I... I didn't want
to waste you on you.

471
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:35,510
In fact, I wasn't even going
to talk to you about acting,

472
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:37,640
but if you are game,
boy, that would be great.

473
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,010
Let's circle back to that.

474
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:40,970
There's a television show,
was it,

475
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:43,480
that you made about my family.

476
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,480
Michael was referring
to the George Bluth Sr. episode

477
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,690
of a horribly narrated
crime reenactment series

478
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:51,360
called Scandalmakers

479
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,440
that Carl had directed
years earlier.

480
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:55,860
Did you retain the rights
to my father's story?

481
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,490
Nah, man, rights cost money.

482
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:58,950
I never bothered
with that stuff.

483
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,160
I figure you go ahead,
you shoot it.

484
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,120
Better to ask for forgiveness
than beg for permission.

485
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,040
As it turned out, Carl

486
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,210
had never bothered
to get either,

487
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,000
which is why he made himself
the subject

488
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,460
of the final episode
of the series.

489
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,460
Lee Nails, only pressed on once.

490
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,470
Carl, we're at a swap meet.

491
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,260
Okay.
There he is.

492
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,100
- Carl Weathers.
- Mr. Weathers-- Carl Weathers.

493
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,350
You've been accused
of producing a television show

494
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:24,390
based on real-life events
for which you've done

495
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:28,560
none of the due diligence
in securing the rights thereto.

496
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,270
I only have one question.

497
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,610
Can I have your rights?

498
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,110
- Of course.
- Of course, Carl Weathers.

499
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,480
Cut!

500
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:36,320
Now we'll move on,
do a little voice-over.

501
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,450
How much are these belts?

502
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,280
- Oh, oh, oh, God.
- DeBrie!

503
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,030
Her heart stopped.
She's  dying.

504
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:43,240
Oh, hey, Dave,
you shaved, I like it.

505
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,700
Please get the paddles!

506
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,500
Oh, hey, Mike.
How was Ojai?

507
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,960
But, Carl, the whole point

508
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,620
of the movie is that
it's a true story,

509
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:50,710
so I need the rights.

510
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,250
Don't I?

511
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:55,630
Man, you're as green
as old lady Crinch.

512
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:58,930
Come on, people don't go
to movies to see rights.

513
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:01,010
People go to movies
to see actors.

514
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:03,050
Now, who you got
as scriptwriter?

515
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,140
And that's
when Michael remembered

516
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,180
that he did know one member

517
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,270
- of the Writers Guild.
- The eye is falling off this one.

518
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:10,980
You mind if I swap it out,
you know, for the restaurant?

519
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,110
Swap it.

520
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,360
And I thought, who's going

521
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,230
to get it right the first time?

522
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,690
Because I don't want
to give a lot of notes.

523
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,320
And then it came to me.

524
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,030
Who knows my father better
than Warden Gentles?

525
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:24,410
Hold on one second.

526
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:26,410
"The first time."

527
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:27,540
Yeah.

528
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,580
My grandson gave me this,

529
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,460
but I guarantee you,
give me an old Royal

530
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,080
and a glass of Scotch,
and I'll give you

531
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:35,340
250 pages where
the lightning hits the tree.

532
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,300
- That's not what we do here.
- I mean,

533
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,510
where the drop hits the pond.

534
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,010
- That's it.
- I apologize.

535
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,260
I've had a few meetings today.

536
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,260
Then...

537
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,640
the yellow robot gets mad

538
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,050
at the pink robot--

539
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,640
- That does...
- correction...

540
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,180
the purple robot.

541
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:51,060
Sorry, I'm,
I'm back to back today.

542
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,150
I bet.

543
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,270
I'm gonna be honest with you.

544
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,440
You're not charring my tree,

545
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,980
and... yeah,

546
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,950
Jerry's not gonna come
off the boat for this one.

547
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,490
This is basically
a story about

548
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,410
- Mm-hmm.
- a fellow like myself

549
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:03,660
- and his father
- Mm-hmm.

550
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,120
and their friend Carl Weathers.

551
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,740
I'm not entirely sure

552
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:10,210
how to organically work him
into the, to the story.

553
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,460
Uh, you know,
maybe he's teaching them

554
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,290
lessons or something.

555
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:15,630
Anyway, I'm gonna leave that
up to your capable hands.

556
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:18,460
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait a minute.

557
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,590
I've turned it off again.

558
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,590
Yeah, those are tricky.

559
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:23,010
Might I suggest

560
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:25,090
bringing in someone younger
to play the father--

561
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,760
a Philip Seymour Hoffman type?

562
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,720
A Philip Seymour Hoffman type.

563
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:29,720
And so, naturally,

564
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:31,100
I-I thought of you.

565
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,730
Well, you know,
I'm a married man,

566
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,350
so I don't really
keep a directory

567
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,230
of attractive young
actresses around.

568
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,190
- Okay.
- I mean, are you really planning

569
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:41,030
on using her, or is it like
Conan with the girl writers?

570
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,400
It doesn't matter, it...

571
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,070
I-I'm here to talk
to you about a movie

572
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,450
that we're gonna make
about the family,

573
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:46,740
and I thought
that it might be really fun

574
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,330
for us to work together again.

575
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:50,580
Help me remember.
What did we do together?

576
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:53,080
You came over for a chicken
and ham-water dinner

577
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,160
that my family threw to raise
some funds for itself.

578
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:56,630
And they're finally
getting around

579
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,340
to making a movie of that, huh?

580
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,630
There's more to it than that.

581
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,170
It's, it's about
a young man trying

582
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:03,680
to get out from under
his domineering father

583
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,520
while dealing
with the slow death of his wife.

584
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,260
That just saved me 12 bucks.

585
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,390
I'm not going to see it.

586
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,350
I'm not asking you to see it;
I'd like for you to be in it.

587
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:13,730
No offense, I have a job.
I mean, I have a good thing.

588
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:15,190
- Oh, hey, Mr. O'Brien.
- Hey, how's it going?

589
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:17,110
- Real good.
- Andy, quick note.

590
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,610
Uh, just 'cause I look at you
when we're doing the show

591
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:21,860
and ask you a question doesn't
mean you have to respond.

592
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,780
Sometimes it's funny
when you don't say anything,

593
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,240
and the audience gets
to think, "Hey,

594
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,740
Andy really is stupid."

595
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:30,580
Gets a big laugh.

596
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,410
- Hey, you're new.
- I've been here a year.

597
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:34,580
And you're funny, too.

598
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,870
Let's get you set up
in a writer's office.

599
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,750
Oh, you can have Andy's
if you don't mind

600
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:39,540
the smell of bologna.

601
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:41,380
I'm in.

602
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:44,920
♪ You're simply the best... ♪

603
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:47,680
Michael had assembled
his dream team,

604
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,390
and now it was time
to wow his boss.

605
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:51,990
Excuse me, sir,
could you turn that off,

606
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:52,970
please?

607
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,440
Oh, I thought
that was playing in here.

608
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,900
Sorry, it was a slide show
of my granddaughter's--

609
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,770
daughter's graduation
from college.

610
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:01,150
- Sure. - Michael.
- High school.

611
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:03,190
- Hi.
- Did you get the signatures?

612
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:05,740
Better-- I put together
the core team: acting

613
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,660
- and writing.
- You guys do remember

614
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,330
I have to be back in Burbank
by 1:00 every day, right?

615
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:11,740
- We've got that, uh-huh.
- I'm looking forward to this.

616
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,540
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- This is happening.

617
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,330
- It is happening.
- It's happening.

618
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,370
Dude, you are moving
way too fast.

619
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:17,620
Maybe by Hollywood standards,

620
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,920
you know, but, Kitty, I come
from the business community,

621
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,960
where sometimes you have to
show it to him already built.

622
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,840
Still think
you're going to bury me?

623
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,970
Well, Michael, you may not
have your father's signature,

624
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:30,510
but you sure have
his signature style.

625
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:31,890
Cue the music.

626
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:35,770
I think I just deleted my pitch.

627
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:37,890
As it turns out,
it wouldn't matter.

628
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,770
Uh-oh.

629
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:43,940
Hello, think there's a problem
with the elevator.

630
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,490
Do you have
a scheduled appointment?

631
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:46,890
N-No, we're here
to see Ron Howard.

632
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,950
This is the untitled
Michael B. project.

633
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:50,740
I'm actually a producer here.
How are you?

634
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,950
I've got the office
just below the sunken

635
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:53,370
living room there in Brian's.

636
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:54,870
We're here to pitch
Ron the movie.

637
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,410
I'm sorry, sir, this is
a restricted floor.

638
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:57,960
Louisa, it's all right.

639
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,380
For crying out loud,
I'm not the king of England.

640
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,540
- Ah, there he is, hey, Ron.
- Oh, did you get that signature?

641
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:04,340
You know, I've got
something better--

642
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,670
take a look.

643
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:07,420
Andy Richter?

644
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:09,550
I'm out,  it, I'm out.

645
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,260
Not married to Andy,

646
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,640
- but what I do have is the writer.
- Stephan Gentles,

647
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,890
Warden, East Orange County
Department of Corrections

648
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:19,810
and writer of multiple episodes
of Rocko's Modern Life.

649
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:21,480
Well, everybody's got
to start somewhere.

650
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,360
As long as I don't end up there.

651
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,860
I'll have 25 pages on your desk
by tomorrow morning.

652
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,490
Gosh, that's

653
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:29,900
- putting the cart before the horse.
- Oh, yeah.

654
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:32,410
Loo-Look who I've got
to play Carl Weathers.

655
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:33,490
Oh, is that Cuba?

656
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:34,910
No, no, n-n-no,
that's not Cuba.

657
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:37,580
I did not want to
waste Cuba on Carl.

658
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,870
This is Carl Weathers.

659
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:40,790
Oh, sure, Carl.

660
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,630
You know, I thought it was Cuba

661
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:44,420
with the perfect
Carl Weathers makeup.

662
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:47,590
No, no, no, no, Cuba doesn't
have that kind of range.

663
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:49,010
The thing is,
I really do insist

664
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:51,300
- on controlling the casting myself.
- I get it. - I'm out.

665
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,540
I thought maybe if you just saw
the whole team together.

666
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:55,010
Team, what team?

667
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:56,560
I should be informed
of all meetings.

668
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,930
Hey, Cuba, how you doing?

669
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:59,980
Oh, Brian, you know Carl
Weathers, Stephan Gentles,

670
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,770
Andy Richter,
and Michael Booth.

671
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,440
I'm gonna skip this one.

672
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,900
Good to see you, Brian.

673
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,990
You know, Ron, I think
it might be easier to talk

674
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:13,820
if we just come up
just the rest of the way.

675
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:15,070
Oh, thanks.

676
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,910
Yeah, the elevator's been kooky
since we lowered that floor...

677
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:19,750
but maybe
once you get that signature.

678
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,330
It might be kind of tricky.

679
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:22,710
They're all down
in Orange County.

680
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,670
- Tough to get down there.
- Oh, hey, B.

681
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,340
- Yeah. - We must have an office
down there somewhere.

682
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,380
Yeah, we'll stick you someplace.

683
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,460
Yeah.

684
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,630
We'll stick you someplace.

685
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,100
Michael was starting work

686
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,260
at his new show business office

687
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:40,680
- at Orange County Imagine.
- Charles Dawkins.

688
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:43,690
And his office was already
receiving a lot of visitors.

689
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:46,020
Don't get comfortable.
Sir, thank you, no.

690
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,360
But mostly because
of the sign's similarity

691
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,070
to that of this institution,

692
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:51,530
which also received
some confused visitors.

693
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:52,990
An embolism?

694
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:54,450
I-I was just here
to pitch a game show.

695
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:56,870
Go right out this way,
sir, thank you.

696
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:58,030
- But can I leave a sample?
- It's generous

697
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,080
of you, but they're gonna be
much better

698
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,330
with it down there at Imaging.

699
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:04,650
And that's when Michael got
his most unexpected visitor.

700
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:10,420
Dad, what are you doing here?

701
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:14,380
I wanted to speak
to you in person.

702
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:16,390
I think that you're
a little late, okay?

703
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:20,010
Because I went to you
for a simple signature,

704
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,680
not so I could just make
a movie about the family,

705
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:24,350
but so that I can move on
with my life,

706
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:26,270
and you told me to go to hell.

707
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:28,190
Yeah, you know, sometimes,
when I'm caught off guard,

708
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:30,530
I say things I don't mean.

709
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:32,240
This is a horrible
little office.

710
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,960
So you're here to apologize,
is that right?

711
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:36,950
Yes, and I, uh, brought
you a peace offering.

712
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:39,120
Tetas Gigantes?

713
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,280
You hate it, right?

714
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:41,740
Well, it's, it's Mexican porn.

715
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:44,290
You know, you are
impossible to buy for.

716
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:45,540
Just, uh, give it to me.

717
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,620
- No, no, oh.
- No, no, no, give...

718
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:48,500
- No, no, no.
- See, this is the  kayak

719
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,210
- all over again.
- Dad, I apologize.

720
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:52,170
I was saying it was
a very original gift.

721
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:53,340
No, no, no.
You'll never use it.

722
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:56,340
I will use it, except
for maybe Señor Señoritas.

723
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:58,220
I live in Mexico now

724
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,430
and I, I don't always
know how to ask

725
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:02,060
- exactly for what I want.
- Understandable.

726
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,680
And that's almost over now,

727
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:07,600
which is what I came
to talk to you about.

728
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:09,230
Do you know a guy
named Herbert Love?

729
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,480
I know a lot of people, sure,

730
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,360
'cause I'm a big producer now.

731
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,990
- Yeah?
- He ate a mouse.

732
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:16,400
Let's grab a coffee.

733
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:18,160
Okay, so I guess things
haven't been going

734
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,620
that well for me.

735
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:22,080
And you didn't feel
you could tell me that?

736
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,370
That's why I haven't
heard from you?

737
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:25,290
I guess I was afraid
that if I admitted

738
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:26,660
Sudden Valley was a failure...

739
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:29,330
- Told you so.
- ...you might say, "I told you so."

740
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:32,590
Well, then, you don't
know me at all.

741
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:34,510
It's all right, it's my fault. I
bit off more than I could chew.

742
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:36,260
I mean, I lied
about being a big shot

743
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:39,430
to impress this girl
whose name I don't even know.

744
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:42,560
I've got this crazy idea
that I'm gonna turn into a star

745
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,180
with a film that I can't
get made 'cause I can't get

746
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,600
my own father's signature
on, on, on a release.

747
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,270
- It's like, you know...
- Shh, shh, shh...

748
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:52,650
I didn't know it was
about lying to a girl.

749
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:55,650
Give me the release.

750
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:57,070
You'd do this for me?

751
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:59,070
Of course I will.

752
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:01,070
And so, with his
father's rights in hand,

753
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,120
Michael the producer headed up

754
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,580
to find his lady
"Cinderella Man"

755
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,200
at the Ealing Club,

756
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:09,040
an exclusive show business
hangout.

757
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,210
Ron Howard.

758
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:11,750
Oh, thank you.

759
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:14,340
No, it's Michael Bluth. Hi.

760
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,760
Oh, I remember.

761
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,510
I did it.

762
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:18,550
I got my father's signature.

763
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:20,180
You know, you said
you wanted to focus

764
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,510
on the father-son relationship,
and I love it.

765
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:23,220
Who's not going to
be able to relate

766
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,510
to a son standing up to
his self-centered father?

767
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,100
Sure.

768
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,600
But the father-son relationship
I was interested in

769
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:31,440
was not you and your father,
it was you and your son.

770
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,610
You're the father.

771
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:36,440
But that would make
my son the son.

772
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,690
Bingo.

773
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,400
Michael had to decide

774
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,570
whether being a producer
was worth invading

775
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:45,790
the privacy of a son who had
kicked him out for that reason.

776
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,330
I don't think I can do it.
I don't think I can go...

777
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:49,080
I can't go to my son.

778
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,460
That's, uh-- I just--
I don't even think

779
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,710
that it's worth it just to say
that I'm a producer, like...

780
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,090
- It's your call.
- Yeah.

781
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:59,050
Maybe the real estate business
will come around soon.

782
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:01,180
Will it?

783
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:05,050
I could never reveal that
information to a non-producer.

784
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,310
And then he heard something

785
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:08,470
that made him change his mind.

786
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,850
Michael?

787
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:12,270
Mr. Moobie Producer.

788
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:13,520
That's me.

789
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:19,190
And like all bagpipe music,

790
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,610
it was hard to tell if it was
good music played horribly

791
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:24,450
or horrible music played well,

792
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:26,160
but Michael was eager
to find out

793
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,370
her name
when she was introduced

794
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:30,200
at the end of the set.

795
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:32,670
And tonight on bagpipes...

796
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:39,880
But he got to know her anyway.

797
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,840
Fantastic.

798
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,630
I'm only doing this
in between movies,

799
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,390
which, given how badly I bombed
at that audition yesterday,

800
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,140
it's going to be a while.

801
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,510
Yeah, you shouldn't worry
about that, you're gonna get

802
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,140
something.
You know, sometimes

803
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,850
even students make films.

804
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,110
Yeah, that's really funny.

805
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:58,150
I just could put
your name in for something.

806
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:59,280
I do know Ron Howard.

807
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:03,320
Love that I make you laugh.

808
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,490
You seriously would be
great for this part.

809
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:07,370
You remind me of the person
that, that it's based on.

810
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:09,790
Uh, she, she actually
dies on camera.

811
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:10,790
Wow.

812
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,370
Make her mentally challenged

813
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:13,710
and I'll thank you
in my Oscar speech.

814
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:14,920
There's a part like that, too,

815
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,880
only she-she comes in later

816
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,750
and she's British,
so she doesn't seem...

817
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,590
No one could ever tell
that she's disabled.

818
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:23,590
I haven't been in work mode
for a while to be honest.

819
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:26,260
I've been, I've been
raising my son.

820
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,640
Oh, you have a son?
I have a son.

821
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,310
- You do?
- Oh, yeah, we've got a little issue,

822
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:30,310
though, right now.

823
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,470
Let me guess.

824
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,850
He's pushing you away?

825
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:34,810
- Yes.
- My son practically

826
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:36,850
kicked me out of his school
the other day.

827
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,360
That is literally
what my son did to me.

828
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,820
Then I said to him,

829
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,570
"You have no privacy from me."

830
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:44,280
That's what I should do.

831
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,570
Lem's six in August.

832
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:46,570
Yours?

833
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:48,450
- Seven in July.
- Aw...

834
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:49,740
Michael regretted the lie,

835
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,740
so he sort of split
the difference.

836
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:54,290
Teen-- 17

837
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:55,500
- in July.
- Oh.

838
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,870
They grow up so fast,
don't they?

839
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,250
Oh, wow.

840
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:01,880
Well, I guess you got to move
on with your life sometime.

841
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,300
Yes.

842
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:08,680
Yes, you do.

843
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,680
Oh, n-no, you know what?

844
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,600
I don't think that this
is-- it's not a good idea.

845
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,390
This is a great idea.
Why don't you think this is

846
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:16,940
- a great idea?
- 'Cause people can see.

847
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,810
- Nobody can see.
- Oh, God.

848
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:20,820
Wow, you weren't kidding

849
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,230
when you said you had
a part for me.

850
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,820
- That was absolutely insane.
- Thanks.

851
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:27,200
I've never done anything
that crazy before.

852
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,360
- Perfect.
- I want to do a lot more of that.

853
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:29,490
I want to see you again.

854
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:31,330
I want to take you out
to a nice dinner.

855
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:32,660
- Oh.
- So, then, uh...

856
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,580
Well, this will have
to tide you over until then.

857
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,370
Oh, look at those.

858
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:38,750
Boy, without this, I wouldn't
know you had a tattoo.

859
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:40,000
Oh, anyone that gets
that much clothing

860
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,920
off me better know my name.

861
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,340
- Good night.
- Good night.

862
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:50,390
And that's when
Michael finally saw her name.

863
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:51,970
Oh, my God.

864
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:56,350
I'm dating
Ron Howard's girlfriend.

865
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:58,520
Actually she's his daughter.

866
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:02,060
But that's kind of worse,
don't you think?

867
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:07,860
Michael starts
to really learn the business.

868
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,570
We can keep going around
another 20 minutes, if you want,

869
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:10,950
but I know what
I'm talking about.

870
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:13,580
I just went through this
last week with a guy.

871
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,450
That is a hernia.

872
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:17,040
I'm gonna send you to my guy
over at Hoag Hospital.

873
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,460
They call him the
Bulge Whisperer.

874
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,830
He does 20 of these a week.

875
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,880
And after failing to
get back to Burbank on time,

876
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,710
Andy calls in a favor

877
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,340
from his identical
quintuplet brother Rocky.

878
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:28,380
All right, my next guest
is a famous pilot

879
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:31,800
who safely crashed his plane
into the Hudson River.

880
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,390
That's kind of a
coincidence, Andy.

881
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:35,890
We've got a pilot
who crashes planes,

882
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:38,890
and you're an actor
who crashes pilots.

883
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:41,810
And Rocky hurts two nice
red-haired guys' feelings...

884
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:43,610
Yeah, that's really funny.

885
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:45,440
You know what else
would be funny?

886
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,360
If I ripped that red rug
right off your head

887
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,990
and turned you into Ron Howard.

888
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:53,400
...while getting the biggest
laugh of Andy's career.

889
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:59,490
