1
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,690
On the top of a hillside,

2
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:17,890
deep in the mountains
of Shuturmurg, India,

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,730
sits a mystical retreat
long sought out

4
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,860
- by those seeking answers...
- Is this real?

5
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,440
to the questions
that define us.

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,110
I mean, is any of this real?

7
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,110
How do I know what's real?

8
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:31,570
This is Lindsay Bluth-Fünke.

9
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,530
You see me before you, yes?

10
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,450
I am real to you.

11
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:39,580
And this bag next to me,
it is as real as you or me.

12
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:40,960
No, I know that one's real.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,540
I meant the other one--
the Louis Vuitton.

14
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,500
I don't remember Vuitton
having two E's.

15
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,340
The hillside was also known

16
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,420
- for their bargains on designer handbags.
- Oh, no!

17
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,130
That's how they do it here.

18
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,390
You can't go wrong.
Best bag on the mountain.

19
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:54,640
I love this bag.
I give you 60 for it.

20
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,310
- It's the best bag on the mountain.
- Excuse me.

21
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,350
- I just promised it to her.
- I'll give you $70.

22
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,600
Lindsay Bluth had come
to India for both reasons.

23
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,020
- Uh, $120. - You just bought
the best bag on the mountain.

24
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,360
- Congratulations.
- Best bag on the mountain.

25
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,740
Now the story of a family

26
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,240
whose future
was abruptly canceled

27
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,530
and the one daughter
who had no choice

28
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,740
but to keep her life together.

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,960
It's Lindsay's...

30
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,130
- I love it.
- Lindsay was on

31
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,800
a spiritual journey to let go

32
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,430
of all possessions
and to find something cute

33
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,050
- to keep her stuff in.
- It's gorgeous.

34
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,720
Months earlier,
Lindsay had lost her bearings

35
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,220
after finding out
she wasn't born

36
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:40,100
to the family
she couldn't bear.

37
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,270
- I'm adopted?
- So, after getting

38
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,230
briefly creepy
with her brother...

39
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,320
I'm just not that into
older women.

40
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,820
- Don't worry about it.
- You bastard!

41
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,190
She shared some resentments

42
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,070
with her family
at the boat party.

43
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,990
Kitty likes to scratch...

44
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,700
But before she could
disassociate herself

45
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,780
- from the Bluth name...
- Because now I know that

46
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,160
we're not related.
Anyway, Michael...

47
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,540
Oh, my God. The SEC.

48
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,000
...the Bluth name
would become...

49
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,460
...as sullied as Newport Bay
on the fifth of May.

50
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,380
They are persecuting me.

51
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,380
It was an accident.
This is ridiculous!

52
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,220
If I'd told them we were taking
a bunch of gays out there

53
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,180
to get married,
they'd have thrown me a parade.

54
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,890
Let's tell them we were taking
a bunch of gays to get married.

55
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,680
Yeah, I don't think your record
on that issue

56
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,930
is going to back that up, Mom.

57
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,390
In fact, it was an issue

58
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,060
of theBay Windowmagazine

59
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,020
that would most damage her
with the gay community.

60
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,270
Fine. We'll say
they took it on a joyride.

61
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,400
And you have no right
to criticize me.

62
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,950
At least I was able
to turn myQueenaround.

63
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,280
None taken.

64
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,120
This is Tobias Fünke,

65
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,820
who should have taken more.

66
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,450
- Oh.
- You cannot say

67
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:42,120
one nice thing
to your daughter, can you?

68
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,330
Adopted daughter.

69
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,500
And that's not true.

70
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,250
Could I have the Bluth
family over here, please?

71
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:50,750
And over here, the victims
of the Bluth family?

72
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,050
And that's when Lindsay

73
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,720
found a label more fitting
than "Bluth."

74
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,010
No, Lindsay, you're going
to the wrong area.

75
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,680
Kenny, Chet, Curtis, Mike,
Bix and Gator are over here.

76
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,520
We should be over here
at the Bluth area with Gob

77
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,480
and Buster and, uh... uh...

78
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,060
uh, your brother, uh...

79
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:11,020
- Michael?
- Michael. Yes.

80
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:13,900
Sorry. I was thinking
of Mike, the hot seaman.

81
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,160
- No, where is Michael?
- It doesn't matter.

82
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,410
He's not my brother.

83
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:18,780
This isn't my family.

84
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,160
No, I've spent years...

85
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,500
Yes! Got my yes.
I got that big yes.

86
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,750
I've spent years trying
to fit into this family,

87
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,130
and it's not me.

88
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,500
My life is a fallacy.

89
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,130
Oh...

90
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,800
♪ Is that a gal I see? ♪

91
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,470
♪ No, it's just
a phallus... eee! ♪

92
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,970
We loved that.
Where's that from?

93
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,640
It's from nothing.

94
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,890
But it made her
realize this, too.

95
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,730
I don't know if there's
a right time to say this,

96
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:50,110
but this marriage of ours,
it hasn't been working.

97
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:54,360
Yeah... there's nothing
keeping us together.

98
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:59,570
I... I believe we're thinking
the same thing.

99
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,950
- Yeah, we should end it.
- Let's give it another shot.

100
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,790
To the head. Kill it.

101
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,330
Yes.

102
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,080
Lindsay was looking
for inspiration

103
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:14,630
before she set out
on her new path.

104
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,840
And it only took
until the "Pray" section

105
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,220
of Eat, Pray, Love
for her to find it.

106
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,930
Hmm.

107
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,430
Soon, she was beginning
a journey to reinvent herself.

108
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,140
Ugh. I'm doing it again.

109
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,100
I have to let go
of these material things.

110
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,570
To leave the trappings
of her old life

111
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:35,230
and try to live with less.

112
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,030
There.

113
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,030
Her immersion
into Indian culture began

114
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,820
even before reaching
the airport.

115
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,490
And, uh...
and so this daily prayer,

116
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:43,780
it connects one to the whole.

117
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,040
You know,
you sense the oneness in all.

118
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,170
And they have
normal toilets, right?

119
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,840
And after an hour or so

120
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,960
withSkyMall,where she was

121
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,800
proud of herself
for only buying two things--

122
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,090
a self-cleaning litter box
in case she ever got a cat

123
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:10,680
and an inflatable hat box
in case she ever got a hat--

124
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,390
she got to a great article
in the in-flight magazine

125
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,480
and found herself filling up

126
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,610
with inner peace
and acceptance.

127
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,860
I mean, not right away.

128
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,400
What is she doing back there?

129
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,360
That passenger had been

130
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,780
pushing on her seat
for like four hours.

131
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:29,280
Lindsay's journey
to let go of her baggage

132
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:32,080
got off to a bad start
at baggage claim

133
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,960
when she picked up
the wrong baggage.

134
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,250
And her Western notions
of the value of life

135
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:39,590
were challenged on the bus ride
to the hotel.

136
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,960
Oh, my God.

137
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,470
Did... did we just
hit something?

138
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,050
Shouldn't we stop?

139
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:48,050
No. It wasn't a cow.

140
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:51,010
It was just a tourist.

141
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,020
And that's howLindsay's path

142
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,430
- to living with less...
- Wait. This isn't my...

143
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,600
How am I supposed to find out

144
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,480
who I really am
dressed like this chick?

145
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,860
...took a brief detour into
a shopping spree at India's

146
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,940
- famous Mall Mountain.
- It's cute on me.

147
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,360
But I thought it was
supposed to say "Kate."

148
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:10,200
Oh, no, anything under a small
is considered

149
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,780
a "David Spade."

150
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,790
I love this jacket.
I'll give you 60 for it.

151
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:14,950
Best coat on the mountain.

152
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,160
- 65.
- 70! It'd look great

153
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,880
on my wife or my sickly son.

154
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,790
- 100 bucks. Yes!
- $100, yes.

155
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,210
And soon, she was back

156
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,630
at the hotel and ready

157
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,880
for her spiritual experience.

158
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,930
Yeah, hi.

159
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:31,850
Uh, were you able
to book my 3:00 shaman?

160
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:33,640
Oh, yes.
Did you want the deep wisdom

161
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,930
or just a light ego cleanse?

162
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,270
We do those by the pool.

163
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,140
- There's a pool?
- It's hard to tell

164
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,900
because there are
so many people in it,

165
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,020
but yes, it is a pool.

166
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,440
Well, yeah, by the pool, then.

167
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,610
And, uh, do you think
you can get someone

168
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:48,530
to remove the smell of lamb
from my room?

169
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,780
Of course. And which
animal smell would you prefer?

170
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,320
Which do you prefer?

171
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,740
But at her 3:00 p.m. shaman...

172
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,330
You are living a life
without love.

173
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,330
- Lindsay got a deeper treatment
- How do I learn to...

174
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:00,920
- than she had hoped for.
- be happy?

175
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,500
You know, to love?

176
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:05,800
When love is near your heart,
you'll be happy.

177
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,880
You must live life truthfully.

178
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:12,090
Yeah, no, I-I-I do live
truthfully,

179
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,760
but, uh...

180
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:16,310
I'm just so full of passion.

181
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,390
You are so full of.

182
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,770
Yeah, yeah.

183
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,980
Although, in my culture,
"full of"

184
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,360
is kind of like a dig.

185
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,480
I mean, you'd never say it
to a customer.

186
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,650
But, uh, yeah, no,
I-I know what you mean.

187
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:30,570
This bag is as fake as you are.

188
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,780
Well, how do I learn?

189
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,200
Just look at the spelling.

190
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,660
God. No, I...

191
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,750
Pull your head out of the sand.

192
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,120
Love is where you left it.

193
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,580
You mean... back home?

194
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,840
God.

195
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,840
The only person back home
is Tobias.

196
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,090
You have no children?

197
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:50,470
Lindsay thought
she was being hit on.

198
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,930
No. Why do you ask?

199
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,470
Wait a minute.
You're saying I've come

200
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:57,390
halfway around the world
to find out

201
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,810
I need to go back home?

202
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:01,350
God, I haven't even gone
to the beach yet.

203
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:05,360
She had. It was just
too crowded to see the water.

204
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,110
It was a moving experience,

205
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,280
but after leaving the tent,
it wasn't just

206
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,660
the shaman's words
that got through to her.

207
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,990
It was this.

208
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,990
I'm sorry.
Your AmEx was declined.

209
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,330
Your account is maxed out.

210
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,200
We had to cancel
your shaman appointment.

211
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,120
No, no, I just talked
to the shaman,

212
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,870
just right back at...

213
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,210
Get out! Get out!

214
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,800
Go away! Get out!
Get out! Get out!

215
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:33,340
I'm sorry to yell at you,
but as I said, it was declined.

216
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,800
So get out.

217
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,760
But, fortunately, the universe

218
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:39,850
offered a solution
to her financial problem

219
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:43,100
that wasn't too far off
from what her shaman had said.

220
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,270
Oh, I've
got money for you, sweetie,

221
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:47,900
but it means my loving daughter
smiling next to her husband

222
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,400
sitting behind me at the trial.

223
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,990
Would you take a grimace?

224
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,450
So it was with
this dual intention

225
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:58,370
that she reached out
to a husband she'd left behind,

226
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,830
with a new sense
of inner peace.

227
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,580
Of course, there was still
some outer stuff

228
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,830
she needed to work through.

229
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,170
Hello. It's Tobias.

230
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,420
Leave a message.

231
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,000
I'm ready to make this work.

232
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,260
It was with a sense
of enlightenmentthat Lindsay

233
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,220
returned from her
spiritual journey...

234
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,510
...to get her hands on
the stimulus money, too, right?

235
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,060
Stop with the prayer hands.

236
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,720
It just looks
like you're out of ideas.

237
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:23,020
Seriously, shoot me
if you ever catch me doing that.

238
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,730
Says the least spiritual
man I know.

239
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,850
What deal
did you strike with her?

240
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,270
What part of her soul
did you buy?

241
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:30,940
All I've asked
is that she testify

242
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,820
that I was a wonderful mother
who did her best.

243
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,200
So all of it.

244
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,360
No, Michael.
I'm not a whore.

245
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,780
I don't get any of the money

246
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,240
until after I do
the disgusting thing.

247
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,410
But I'm not here
just for the stimmy.

248
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,080
I'm here
because a shaman told me

249
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,290
that love is where I left it.

250
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,000
Which, after much soul searching

251
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,880
and by process of elimination,
is Tobias.

252
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,090
I got the part.

253
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,970
And so Lindsay and Tobias

254
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:59,640
took another shot
at being husband and wife,

255
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,470
and although they wouldn't
have money

256
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,980
until after the perjury,
they set about

257
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,060
- buying a home.
- Are you ready to make a move?

258
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:10,060
As you can see,
I'm ready for a lot that's new.

259
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,230
Oh! Good heavens!

260
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,400
Right!

261
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,860
Well, this is a great area.

262
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,570
There's some wonderful
surgi-centers nearby.

263
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,740
We're doing it.
We're really doing this.

264
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,780
Yes! We're gonna get you
in the right house.

265
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,950
And it's just the two of you?
You have no children?

266
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,160
We don't.

267
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,710
We should be honest here.

268
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,000
We have no income flow.

269
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,290
No incoming income flow.

270
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,790
We have plenty
of outgoing income.

271
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,500
No savings, no credit.

272
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,800
I mean, we had some stimmy,

273
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,220
but that went
to his hospital bills.

274
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,590
But there's one thing
we do have--

275
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,590
Work ethic!

276
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,850
Right. No work ethic.

277
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:43,180
But there's one thing
we do have--

278
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,970
we do have a daughter.

279
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,810
I was just on auto-pilot
before, when I said we didn't.

280
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,230
I should have caught that;
yeah, but...

281
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,810
I could've spoken up,

282
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,940
but I just wanted to see
if you guys got there.

283
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,570
Well, you guys seem like
a great family.

284
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,280
We have to be realistic.

285
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,700
I'm in the real estate business.

286
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,450
It's 2006.

287
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,530
That's all good enough for me.

288
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,080
We're gonna put you
in a NINJA loan.

289
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,120
"No income, no jobs,
no assets."

290
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,000
And you don't have to pay
a penny for two years.

291
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,460
Oh, NINJA! Please!

292
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,290
So we'll take something
cozy and intimate.

293
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:12,750
- A one-bedroom.
- Or bigger.

294
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,000
Yeah, how about something nice?
A three-bedroom?

295
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,090
Three does sound bigger.

296
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:16,840
Oh, it definitely is.

297
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,800
You have to remember
that this was a time

298
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,970
when banks were eager to create
as much debt as possible.

299
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,760
...the five-bedroom,
four-car garage.

300
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,350
And I know that you guys
are going to be okay

301
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,890
with just one master bathroom,

302
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:29,560
because a lot of people
do prefer two.

303
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,310
You know, they like
to just have it.

304
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,270
Maybe separate, so we have it.

305
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:34,820
So we have it.
That way we have it.

306
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,980
That way you have it.

307
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,360
Do you think
we really need one?

308
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,820
I'm just gonna
interrupt for a second.

309
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,610
You don't need a wine cellar,

310
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:43,200
if you want to do wine tastings
in your butler's kitchen.

311
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,330
I mean, this really isn't
what we discussed.

312
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:48,200
Well, we didn't discuss
any of this, but, uh...

313
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,580
yes, uh, I guess, that way,
we... we have it.

314
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,830
Well... yeah...

315
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,960
That way,
you'll definitely have it.

316
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,840
And then once you have it,
that way, you'll have it.

317
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,170
But do we need a gatehouse?

318
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,430
I just put John Beard into a
house with a double gatehouse.

319
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,890
Now, that's John Beard;
he's on television.

320
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:06,350
No one's gonna look down on you

321
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,310
just 'cause you have less
than John Beard.

322
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:10,060
- Is this crazy?
- I think so.

323
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,560
We'll take
the double gatehouse.

324
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,270
Oh, is that what you thought?
Because...

325
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:14,900
- Well, that way, we'll have it.
- We have it. We have it.

326
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,480
And that way, you have it.

327
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,570
There was a lot of this
going on back then.

328
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:19,650
This way, we have it.

329
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:21,400
And soon, they were
starting their new life

330
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:24,320
- Good point!
- in their new, beautiful home.

331
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,080
Mother's Day Eve

332
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,330
was the most joyous day
of the year.

333
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:30,500
Maeby, you're gonna
be late for school.

334
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,540
And what they lost
in coziness...

335
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,250
God, they grow up so slowly.

336
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:37,290
...they made up for in
cavernous, unfurnished space.

337
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,550
- And the robot's dead again.
- Oh! Poor little guy.

338
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:44,590
Ran out of juice before
he could reach his...

339
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,850
With her mother's
trial coming up,

340
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:51,270
Lindsay made an effort
to work on her testimony.

341
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,600
...when I was hungry, I...

342
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,810
Go on.

343
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:57,360
You don't want me to say
this next part, do you?

344
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,980
I think it tells the story.

345
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:02,150
But am I
accidentally being funny,

346
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,570
or am I purposely being funny?

347
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:06,030
It's not supposed to be funny.

348
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:08,700
"Suckled at her champagne
glass breasts"?

349
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:09,790
Is it a joke?

350
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,000
Buster wrote it.

351
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,450
Recently?

352
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,710
I adapted it from a letter
he wrote from camp.

353
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,210
I miss you, Mommy.

354
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,670
Camp is scary at times.

355
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,380
When I was cold, you clothed me,

356
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,880
when I was hungry...

357
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,340
Uh, how do I say this?

358
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,890
Suckled at your champagne
glass breasts.

359
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:28,470
Oh, that's good.

360
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,010
It doesn't matter.
I'll be proofing it, anyway.

361
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,270
Oh, God.

362
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,810
This is from
Camp Kiss-A-Me-Mommy?

363
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:36,100
Just read the copy.
You're getting paid for this.

364
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,190
No. You know what?

365
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,400
The money is not
important to me.

366
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,820
My shaman said...

367
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:43,030
Oh, don't give me that
mystical nonsense.

368
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:45,110
You think you're
better than I am.

369
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:47,700
But you're a lot more like me
than you think you are.

370
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,160
Now, let's take it from:

371
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,120
"I hope she gives me
bubble baths forever."

372
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,120
And I want to smell the suds.

373
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,420
But worse news was
around the corner.

374
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,670
The collapse of the
California housing market

375
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,210
is taking a personal toll...

376
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,210
- Uh-oh.
- ...with layoffs here at the station.

377
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,260
In addition,
I'm leaving the keys

378
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,340
to my 10,000-square-foot home
in Harbor Shallows

379
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,510
- here on the desk...
- Well, it probably

380
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,850
shouldn't affect our area.

381
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:12,180
He's over by
where the fountain is.

382
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,310
Might I say to them

383
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,060
good luck getting that

384
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,020
raccoon smell
out of the gatehouse,

385
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,560
because I never could.

386
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,570
But you and I are okay, right?

387
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,570
I mean, this works, right?

388
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:25,190
Never better.

389
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:30,240
And the week
of Lucille's trial,

390
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,120
they got some even worse news.

391
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,950
What's this?
Mother's not going to pay?

392
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,870
She actually said
she'd only pay me

393
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,460
if my testimony is believable.

394
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,960
Lindsay! Lindsay!

395
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,500
...but how am I supposed
to say something like

396
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,500
"I love you, Mother!"

397
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,670
and sound believable?

398
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:47,010
Well, geez... Jesus C. Penny!

399
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,880
You know,
I wish I had the luxury

400
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,760
of not sounding believable.

401
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,430
But that's not an option for
an out-of-work actor, is it?

402
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:55,600
Or it's why you're out of work!

403
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,190
Well, I beg one's pardon,
but I have been dying to go

404
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:02,110
to that Method Acting Clinic
that I see on my nightly drives,

405
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,650
but you won't let me!

406
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:05,820
Because you already
wasted all that money

407
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,200
on Carl Weathers'
Master Acting Class.

408
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,320
Well, I'm sorry,
but I'm such a star

409
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:14,290
that I didn't pay attention
to anything he said!

410
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,620
Oh, well then, maybe I should go
to your Method Acting Class,

411
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,710
to make my testimony
more believable!

412
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,080
That's actually a good idea.

413
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,540
Maybe you could--
Oh! Hi. Yes.

414
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,000
Well, perhaps we should
go together.

415
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:29,380
Yeah. Might be good
for us, as a couple.

416
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,220
I do hope so.

417
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,510
I really want
to make this work.

418
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,260
Me, too.

419
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,560
I really love you, Tobias.

420
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,270
Oh, Lindsay, we have

421
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:42,020
got to get you to
that acting clinic.

422
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,770
And that was with me
picturing fudge.

423
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,360
Fudge.

424
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,490
To bond with her husband

425
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,830
and prepare for her testimony,

426
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,700
Lindsay had decided to attend
an acting class with Tobias.

427
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,290
This is the first time

428
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:00,790
I've actually done something
like this with you.

429
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:02,670
I think I always
kind of looked down on it.

430
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:04,580
You know, Lindsay, I think
you'll find that

431
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,000
some of what used to seem
clueless about me

432
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:09,710
is actually something
I'm quite good at.

433
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,590
This... is where I belong.

434
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,470
If you're new here,
you need to go to the window.

435
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,100
Uh, fill out this form first.

436
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,350
And there's some personal
questions on it, like, uh,

437
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:19,600
how you first got hooked.

438
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,980
Well, that's an easy one:

439
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,230
You're A Good Man,
Charlie Brown.

440
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:24,980
No, uh, no,Mame.

441
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,230
No, ma'am...?

442
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,650
You're A Good Man...

443
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,110
You're A Good Man,
Charlie Brown.

444
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,360
Gypsy. Gypsy.

445
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,650
Just come up here and be

446
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,450
as truthful as possible.

447
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:36,370
Okay, this is
overwhelming.

448
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:37,780
They're starting the monologues.

449
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,330
I think this is from
Songs for My Father.

450
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:41,620
This  is
up, right?

451
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,960
What did you say

452
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,040
the name of this acting class
was again?

453
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,210
Method One Clinic.

454
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,250
Okay, I'm gonna go get coffee.

455
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:49,840
Garden Grove Method One Clinic.

456
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,170
And moments later,
as Lindsay, once again,

457
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,760
found herself questioning
her husband's choices,

458
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,850
one of hers was questioned.

459
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,310
Ugh! That's not Free Trade,

460
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,060
and if it's not Free Trade,
it's.

461
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,770
I wouldn't...

462
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:03,480
You don't look like a junkie.

463
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,310
You do. What do you weigh,
like, 90 pounds?

464
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,520
That's so funny!

465
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,070
God, um... thank you.

466
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:10,610
But-but no, no.

467
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:12,440
If I'm addicted to anything,
it's alcohol.

468
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,780
I'm Lindsay.

469
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:16,820
And you're... hmm!
"Bitéme."

470
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:19,410
No, I don't like giving my name
to any state organization,

471
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:21,370
especially after I got kicked
off the voter rolls,

472
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:23,870
'cause I accidentally signed up
for the wrong political group.

473
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,920
Wow.
What group was that?

474
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,210
You know, I don't even remember.

475
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,170
Just some guy in a booth
on the boardwalk.

476
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:31,800
He joined Al Qaeda.

477
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,960
And I only signed up
'cause he was giving away

478
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,470
a free beard brush.

479
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,550
...that says "Al Qaeda" on it.

480
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:39,430
But maybe he thought it was
the designer of the brush.

481
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:40,810
I'm Marky Bark.

482
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,640
Of the tree-freer Barks?

483
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,770
Marky was the son
of Johnny Bark,

484
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:47,650
an activist that Lindsay
had once helped save,

485
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,810
and then kill, a tree.

486
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,070
Oh, my God!
I remember him!

487
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,320
I remember thinking, one day,

488
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,940
he was just gonna
fall out of a tree

489
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:54,950
and break his neck.

490
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,410
Whatever happened to him?

491
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,610
He fell out of a tree
and broke his neck.

492
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,700
Oh, God...

493
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,780
No, I'm just kidding.

494
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,580
Oh...

495
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,660
So how is he?

496
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,700
Oh, he's dead.

497
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,660
But natural causes.

498
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,250
A bunch of deranged bees
chased him out of a tree

499
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:08,420
and he fell to his death.

500
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,750
So, are you here alone, or...?

501
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:10,960
No, I'm with her.

502
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,710
She's a committee member.

503
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,550
Which committee is that?

504
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,050
Itty-bitty.

505
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:19,640
What a wonderful sense of humor.

506
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,180
Listen, the only time DeBrie
can keep food down

507
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,680
is for about 20 minutes
after she comes crashing

508
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,890
off the methadone, so...

509
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,440
- Oh...
- would you care to join us

510
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,020
as we rustle up some grub

511
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,900
to shove down our mouths?

512
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,650
I would like that very much.

513
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:33,650
So Tobias and Lindsay drove

514
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:35,780
to meet their
new friends for lunch.

515
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,280
They are such a neat couple!

516
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,910
Aren't they neat!

517
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,450
It's so fun to have another
couple to go out with.

518
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:42,990
He's amazing.

519
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:45,330
I mean, so passionate
about real issues.

520
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:47,580
He's a real activist--
like me.

521
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:50,380
And she's a real actress,
like me!

522
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,460
Oh, she used to be
in big movies,

523
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,670
but then, like a lot of actors,
the teeth go...

524
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:55,800
Mm!

525
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,010
But she is the perfect age

526
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:59,640
to be a Hollywood actress--42.

527
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,890
Is that all?

528
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:02,350
Oh, I think this is the place.

529
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:04,430
It's a barter restaurant.

530
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:06,390
Marky doesn't believe in money.

531
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:08,440
Do I like barter?

532
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,560
No, it means
they don't deal with money.

533
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,230
That's why I swiped
that methadone tray.

534
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,900
Hmm.

535
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:16,190
What interesting friends
we've made.

536
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:19,280
I think this is exactly
what our marriage needed.

537
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,120
Lindsay and Tobias gathered

538
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,540
with their new friends...

539
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,670
Hi, y'all!
This your first time...?

540
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,130
...at CW Swappigans,

541
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:34,790
a chain that sprung up
after the economic collapse.

542
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,090
We are like a Salvation Army
meets a soup kitchen,

543
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:39,840
meets a gastro pub,

544
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,180
meets a Marxist-or
Leninist-type social structure.

545
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,930
These are things
that you can order

546
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:46,930
and these are things
that we will accept.

547
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:50,060
As you see on the bottom,
we don't have the fish,

548
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,770
and we're not taking
any more lava lamps.

549
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:54,230
Uh-oh!
I can see this one's got

550
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,820
that deer
in the headlights look!

551
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,280
Oh, no.
He just took some methadone.

552
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,450
He thought he was driving,
with a cocktail tray.

553
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:03,070
Oh, speaking of that...

554
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:05,200
How about mozzarella sticks
for the table?

555
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,410
Cocktail tray, light scratching,
for mozzarella sticks.

556
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:11,120
Six, no sauce.

557
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,040
And maybe some sparkling water
for the table.

558
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,380
Oh, I'm sorry, sir. We're no
longer taking hotel soaps.

559
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,920
This is fun.

560
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,010
A lot of people couldn't handle

561
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:21,840
a Dumpster dive
for their first double date.

562
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,890
Is that what this is?

563
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,510
Now, wait... wait a second.

564
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,020
I wasn't driving?

565
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,520
It's just so refreshing
to meet people

566
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,480
with real passion
about changing the status quo.

567
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,780
Lindsay and I
don't have a single friend.

568
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,030
Is the food here yet?

569
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:43,820
I'm not hungry,
but... but, uh...

570
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,320
- Oh, look, it's butter.
- DeBrie.

571
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:50,040
DeBrie, that's our butter.

572
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,370
We were going to swap it
for dessert.

573
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:54,460
No, she's improvising.
Uh, yes, ma'am.

574
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,500
You seem to be liking
that butter substitute

575
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,790
at Swappigans.

576
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,250
Uh, yes, and...

577
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,510
wh-what else could you swap for?

578
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,930
Uh, yes, and... uh...

579
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,390
Oh, I'm out. She's too good.

580
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,970
I... I don't know who my guy is.

581
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:08,430
I don't... I don't have a guy.

582
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:09,810
No, she just likes butter.

583
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,480
Come on, let's get you
cleaned up.

584
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,890
- Don't touch anything.
- Marky, I'll take her.

585
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:14,230
You two just got here.

586
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,940
Have a chat about.
I'll clean her up.

587
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,730
- Come on, DeBrie.
- Num, num, num, num.

588
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:19,230
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

589
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,730
I-I love it here.

590
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,900
My mother would hate this place.

591
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,700
You know, Lindsay,
I-I have to tell you,

592
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,990
when I first met you,
I thought you were one of those

593
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:30,830
typical, uptight, snobby,
Newport Beach,

594
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:32,950
vapid... nut-busters!

595
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,460
You know, one of those monsters

596
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,000
that lives in
a 10,000-square-foot house

597
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,500
that they destroyed
the wetlands for.

598
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,210
Those were wetlands?

599
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,670
That explains
our Thanksgiving miracle.

600
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,260
What do you mean,
you didn't make dinner?

601
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,970
I didn't realize
it was Thursday, okay?

602
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:48,720
There's got to be
something here.

603
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,600
Oh! Oh!

604
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,430
Oh! Get it! Get it!

605
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,140
Chase it into the oven!

606
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,480
Come on. Come on.
Here, little ducky.

607
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,230
- That's a good duck.
- Good duck.

608
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:01,690
In you go!

609
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:05,030
This is going to be
the greatest Thanksgiving ever.

610
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:07,280
It's a miracle!

611
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,990
Well, I actually do live

612
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,740
in a fairly large house
right now.

613
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,370
But we've never made
a payment on it.

614
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:13,950
So you're sticking it
to Big Banking.

615
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,120
- That's cool.
- Yes.

616
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,040
In fact, I'm only in America

617
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,750
because a shaman told me
that love

618
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:22,000
would come to me
when I accepted who I am

619
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,920
- and didn't run away.
- Sounds like a good shaman.

620
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,010
Oh, he was the house shaman
at the Four Seasons Mumbai,

621
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:29,890
so you figure
he's got to be pretty good.

622
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:32,810
Oh, and he turned into
an ostrich at the end, so...

623
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:35,230
They're not going to have that
at the Embassy Suites.

624
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:38,310
That's funny.
I actually run an ostrich farm.

625
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:42,610
♪ Co... incidence! ♪

626
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:44,690
That's not a coincidence.

627
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,990
♪ Yes, it is. ♪

628
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:49,240
Mini pizzas, no pepperoni!

629
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,700
Marky, I've got to tell you,

630
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,370
talking about these
social issues, it's...

631
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:54,950
the first time I've felt
like myself

632
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,580
in a really long time.

633
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,460
That's because I say
what I mean, I do what I feel.

634
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,880
No lies.

635
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,340
Lindsay felt guilty

636
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,210
because she was about
to go enter

637
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,260
a crab house/courtroom
and do just that.

638
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,720
That's why my motto is:

639
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,430
"Live truthfully
and skate through life."

640
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:13,560
Marky felt guilty
because it wasn't his motto.

641
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,600
It was the motto of a surf
and skateboard company.

642
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,810
Live truthfully.

643
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:19,350
Skate through life.

644
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,940
That's amazing.

645
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,440
I haven't felt this deep

646
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,650
a connection with someone
in a long, long time.

647
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,070
Other than DeBrie.

648
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,030
I can't believe
we just did that.

649
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,990
I can't believe how little give
your teeth have.

650
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,080
So, where do you keep
your ostriches?

651
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,410
Sheraton mini soap
for a taco salad?

652
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,170
We don't take hotel soap!

653
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:43,130
And perhaps it was
to get back at her mother...

654
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:45,590
- Leave a tip! Leave a tip!
- ...or to get out of

655
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:48,260
a relationship that had
been over for a long time,

656
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,260
but that's when
Lindsay hopped off

657
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,430
to pursue a life
she felt was her destiny.

658
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:56,010
And the new lovers
discovered each other.

659
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,390
The beautiful female body,

660
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:00,640
the horrible male.

661
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:08,690
Wow. That was so...

662
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,570
- fast.
- Thanks.

663
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:13,160
Well, I didn't know how long
we'd be stuck in traffic, so...

664
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,700
Oh! And it sounds

665
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,950
- like it's moving, so...
- Move it!

666
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,040
Come on! Come on!

667
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,250
- Let's go!
- Careful!

668
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:23,580
And as they drove, they learned
so much about each other.

669
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:26,040
I was always just
in such a rush to grow up

670
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:28,420
and change this world,
and foolishly,

671
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,800
the teeth I pulled
were my adult teeth,

672
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,590
so this guy all the way
to that guy back there,

673
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,890
that's a... just a piece
of wood I stick in there.

674
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:37,350
I mean, they're just
chewing tools.

675
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:39,100
I don't care about looks.

676
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,350
But you find me pretty,
though, right?

677
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:42,640
No.

678
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,310
I have no idea
what you look like.

679
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:46,110
I have this condition
called face blindness.

680
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:48,150
I mean, I can tell
you're a woman.

681
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,570
Oh, stop.

682
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:52,070
But, honestly, no,
all I see is, like,

683
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:55,530
eyes and nose, you know,
hair, ears and...

684
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:57,950
But I can tell you got
a great heart, Lindsay.

685
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:00,000
I can tell
you've been living a lie.

686
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,290
You and I are going to change
this world together.

687
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,790
You know, my shaman

688
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:08,040
told me that I should stop
caring about appearances.

689
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:11,630
You know, my whole life, that's
all anyone has ever praised.

690
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:14,050
All my mom ever cared about.

691
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:16,180
Because I'm really pretty.

692
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:19,430
I just thought I'd tell you that
so the story made sense.

693
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:22,270
- I don't care.
- But I guess it's kind of karma

694
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:24,940
that I ended up with someone
who wanted to make love to me

695
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,350
no matter what I look like.

696
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,520
Also wanted to make sure
you weren't a dude.

697
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:31,690
I can tell with voices usually,
but some guys, they'll...

698
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,700
they'll fool you
if that's what they want to do.

699
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,870
Hey...

700
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,950
Are you smiling at me?

701
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,700
Lindsay decided
it was only fair

702
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,660
to let her husband know

703
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,920
their new start
had reached a new end.

704
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,330
I left.

705
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,540
I guess you noticed.

706
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,250
Um, look, I'm sorry.

707
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,970
I-I really do care about you,
Tobias, but we were trying

708
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:57,840
to save something
that just couldn't be saved.

709
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:01,010
And I have to follow
my shaman's advice. I...

710
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:05,520
I have to be true
to myself for once.

711
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:09,310
And Marky, he sees me
for who I really am.

712
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,440
- He respects me and...
- Come on, lady!

713
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,820
You want to wrap this up?

714
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,570
My lady needs to call
her loser ex.

715
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:16,740
Marky, it's me.

716
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,320
It's Lindsay.

717
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,450
Oh.

718
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:21,870
I thought you
were taking a dump.

719
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:22,950
Oh, I must have
scared the

720
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:24,540
off that lady in the bathroom

721
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:27,830
when I threw the door open
and told her I loved her.

722
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,590
He loves me?

723
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:33,170
Sorry. False alarm.

724
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:34,670
- I don't love you.
- Uh, I got to go.

725
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:36,470
Can you delete this
so I can leave

726
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:38,010
- a message for Maeby?
- It's good. She's fine.

727
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:40,010
And soon, the lovers arrived

728
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:42,970
and discovered the joys
of their new desert home,

729
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:46,100
dancing and making love
all night.

730
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:49,230
Now, that time...

731
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:51,110
was also very quick.

732
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:54,690
And now we've freed the night up
to dance again.

733
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:55,940
- Come on.
- Oh. Okay.

734
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,450
And the next day,

735
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,320
Lindsay awoke
to discover the destiny

736
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,330
foretold to her in India
in drab colors before her.

737
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:05,290
Get away from her.

738
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:06,410
Don't mess with her!

739
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:07,620
She's none of your business.

740
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,330
Thank you.

741
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:11,420
I said get away from her,
you slut!

742
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,380
You're scaring the bird.

743
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,920
No, no, Mom.

744
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,630
Mom, she's with us.

745
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:17,720
She lives with us now.

746
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,050
And, Mom,
she tells me she's pretty.

747
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:24,140
I have the worst  shaman.

748
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,570
The defense calls to the
oyster bar thing where they sit

749
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:37,320
the adopted daughter,
Lindsay Bluth.

750
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,860
Another chair is empty

751
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,410
- at Lucille's trial.
- Lindsay...

752
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:43,280
Mr. Zuckerkorn,

753
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,410
Shrimp-Shooter Nights
starts in 15 minutes.

754
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:47,660
Is your witness going to appear?

755
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,710
"Appear."

756
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:52,790
Oh, I thought the one
on the pier was a Bubba Gump's.

757
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,750
And, in an effort
to be less glamorous,

758
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,800
Lindsay cuts her hair
only to discover,

759
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,510
- much to her frustration...
- Great. Even cuter.

760
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,600
And Tobias becomes addicted

761
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,470
- to his new profession.
- I'm an addict, and I'm starving.

762
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,810
Yes, you are starving,
so would you like some butter?

763
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:11,190
I could give you some butter,

764
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:14,110
and, uh, you can pay for it
w-with a shoe.

765
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,860
Um... I'm sorry, but, uh,

766
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,400
his guy's not giving my guy
anything, uh, to react to.

767
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,950
Uh, could I get some more
of that, uh, acting juice?

768
00:28:21,360 --> 00:29:00,030
