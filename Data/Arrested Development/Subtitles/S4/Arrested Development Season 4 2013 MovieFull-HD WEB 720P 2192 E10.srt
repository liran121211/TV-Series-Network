00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,610
<i>Meet the Jade Dragon Triad.</i>

2
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,700
<i>They take no prisoners...</i>

3
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,580
<i>because they are prisoners...</i>

4
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,290
<i>at the Orange County</i>
<i>Correctional Facility L.I.T.E.</i>

5
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:26,330
<i>They're the ruling gang</i>
<i>in this four-star hellhole,</i>

6
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,000
<i>and the"Real</i>
<i>Asian Prison Housewives</i>

7
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:30,510
<i>"of the Orange County</i>

8
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:32,470
<i>White Collar Prison System."</i>

9
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:37,140
<i>We are a gang;</i>
<i>we stick together.</i>

10
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,970
Uh-huh. Although, right now,

11
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:40,930
one of our members
is a real "B" word.

12
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:44,230
We're getting ready to do
something about it.

13
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:47,190
<i>She come in</i>
<i>and quickly become leader.</i>

14
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:50,480
And we get so sick
of her bossy, bossy behavior,

15
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:52,190
and now she got to go.

16
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,530
In civilian life,
we'd just vote Lu out,

17
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:59,740
but here... she's gonna end up
on the wrong end of a noodle.

18
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,910
<i>Uncooked.</i>

19
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:04,120
<i>You get me?</i>

20
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,870
<i>Ignore them.</i>

21
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,920
Their bark is louder than
the dogs they eat back home.

22
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,880
And I got news for them.

23
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,510
Anyone who comes after me

24
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:15,840
is going to be
one unfortunate cookie.

25
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,060
I made a pun.

26
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:24,020
<i>Now the story</i>
<i>of a family</i>

27
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,940
<i>whose future was</i>
<i>abruptly cancelled,</i>

28
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,350
<i>and the one mother</i>
<i>who had no choice</i>

29
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,440
<i>but to keep herself together.</i>

30
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,490
<i>It's Lucille's</i>
"Arrested Development."

31
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:42,040
<i>Years before</i>
<i>her behavior had become</i>

32
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,000
<i>"bossy, bossy"</i>
<i>with the Jade Dragon Triad...</i>

33
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,750
<i>Lucille was fleeing the SEC...</i>

34
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,630
Full steam, boys!

35
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,550
<i>...when she got a call.</i>

36
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,260
Hello, Lucille.

37
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,550
I still hope you're coming
to our little get-together.

38
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,640
You want to hear
something funny?

39
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,890
I never got an invitation!

40
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:07,020
But I feel like I'm there,
because it's all over the news.

41
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,350
Oh, honey, is that you?

42
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,020
I'm on my deck waving to you.

43
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,480
But with those police boats
following you,

44
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,570
I guess I'm waving good-bye.

45
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,990
You must be mistaken,
because I can't see you,

46
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,820
and you're usually
as hard to miss

47
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,620
as Liberace
wearing a fright wig.

48
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,950
Oh, goodness, that is you!

49
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:25,750
I'm practically
counting your crow's feet.

50
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,540
Oh, well,
maybe I should turn back

51
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,210
and show you another bird.

52
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,000
Hel-Hello?

53
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,960
Did you hear me say that
about the bird? Hello?!

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,300
<i>But it was clear that Lucille 2</i>
<i>hadn't heard it.</i>

55
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,050
<i>So, in a fit of</i>
<i>what sailors call "sea rage..."</i>

56
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,590
Coming about.

57
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,220
<i>...she turned back</i>
<i>to show her the bird.</i>

58
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,350
Coming about, boys!

59
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,220
<i>But Lucille 2</i>
<i>wasn't the only thing</i>

60
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,140
<i>that got flipped that day.</i>

61
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,730
...none of which
would've happened

62
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,560
if it had continued out to sea.

63
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,270
But then the "Queen" changed
course, heading back to shore,

64
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,190
before crashing into the jetty
in what can only be described

65
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,990
as a "sail-past" gone wrong.

66
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,320
<i>And that's when they got</i>
<i>some good news from Barry.</i>

67
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:04,450
First of all,
won't be cheap.

68
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:06,660
It's gonna cost you a fortune
in legal fees.

69
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,500
What's the good news?

70
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,620
<i>good news forBarry.</i>

71
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,250
It's all bad news.

72
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,590
<i>Although, he did have</i>
<i>one good suggestion:</i>

73
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,800
...you're going away
for a long time,

74
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,210
unless we can come up
with a good alibi.

75
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,430
Ma! I fell in the ocean;
why didn't you come for me?

76
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,760
And there it is.

77
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,760
- What?
- I did.

78
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,050
- Buster...
- What?

79
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,470
...tell them
how you were drowning

80
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,100
and I commandeered the ship
to save you.

81
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,270
Tell them what I did.

82
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,230
- The truth.
- Okay.

83
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:34,060
She stole the "Queen Mary"
to get away from the SEC.

84
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,020
Oh, and she winked.

85
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:39,400
it's a glare.

86
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,530
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Oh, God.

87
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:41,570
- Hey!
- What are you doing?

88
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:42,740
Wait, wh-where you going?

89
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,120
Wait, she doesn't
have her make--

90
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,490
I have her lipstick!

91
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,240
<i>But Buster knew that lipstick</i>

92
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,910
<i>wasn't the only thing</i>
<i>she'd be without.</i>

93
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:54,750
<i>So, after she was released to</i>
<i>await trial under house arrest,</i>

94
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:58,340
<i>he made sure she was able</i>
<i>to catch up on what she missed.</i>

95
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,630
This is the same scene
I came back to

96
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:03,430
after Cancun four years ago.

97
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:07,510
<i>And after devising their plan</i>
<i>to build the wall,</i>

98
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,640
<i>it was decided that</i>
<i>George Sr. should move out,</i>

99
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,690
<i>in order to make</i>
<i>their fake divorce look real.</i>

100
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,690
After the trial,
you can move back in.

101
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:18,360
It's only a trial separation.

102
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,650
I made a pun.

103
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,860
Even in this time of stress.

104
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,320
You think you're gonna be okay,
alone with Buster?

105
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,580
If I need a moment to myself,
I'll step out on the balcony.

106
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,290
Your ankle bracelet--
it's gonna go off.

107
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,080
So I'll make him
stand on the balcony.

108
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,080
He's happiest
when he feels useful.

109
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,580
<i>Soon, he was</i>
<i>practically delirious.</i>

110
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,920
<i>There was one bright spot</i>

111
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:44,930
<i>when they simultaneously</i>
<i>stumbled on a term</i>

112
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,100
<i>they both secretly</i>
<i>recognized...</i>

113
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,060
...take this
hot mess of a skirt...

114
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,850
<i>...would be useful</i>
<i>in their future disagreements.</i>

115
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,480
...I'm covered
with glue and I'm, like...

116
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,980
this is a hot mess!

117
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:02,990
<i>But as her trial grew closer,</i>
<i>it was getting harder</i>

118
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:06,490
<i>for Lucille</i>
<i>not to alienate her alibi.</i>

119
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:09,240
This toast has hook holes...

120
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,410
...again! I told you to get rid
of that thing; it's hideous.

121
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,910
Plus, what's gonna happen
when they swear you in?

122
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,000
You're gonna
rip the Bible in half.

123
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,340
The jury will love that.

124
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:21,630
You're getting pretty snippy

125
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:23,300
to your key witness, aren't you?

126
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,800
What do you want?

127
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,510
Maybe you could hook me up
with a little stimmy.

128
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,600
Lil' stimmy.

129
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,720
Are you trying to do this?

130
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,310
Yes!

131
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,350
And I want stimmy
to get a hook that'll do that.

132
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,150
<i>When no such hook</i>
<i>was available,</i>

133
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:42,860
<i>Lucille found other means</i>
<i>to mollify her alibi--</i>

134
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,320
<i>both of which were unveiled</i>
<i>at a family meeting.</i>

135
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,450
...you're the key witness
in your mother's trial.

136
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,160
Wait, I thought
I was the key witness.

137
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,780
- You're the star witness.
- Oh.

138
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:54,660
Because it was your life
I was going after to save.

139
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,160
He fell off the boat.

140
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:58,170
He'll tell you in my own words.

141
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:59,670
Homosexuals kidnapped...

142
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:02,130
Up-up-up.

143
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,210
Homosexuals kidnapped the boat

144
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,010
and took it on a joy ride.

145
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,840
Mother didn't want to trample
their rights, so she let them.

146
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,430
Then she realized
that her son fell

147
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,800
off the boat and into the water,
and she went back.

148
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,680
Oh, and a fish swam by my ankle.

149
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,390
That really happened.

150
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,560
Should I keep that?

151
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,940
- Make it an eel.
- Okay.

152
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,900
- It's gonna be an eel!
- Better.

153
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,980
<i>But alone with Buster,</i>
<i>the tension grew worse,</i>

154
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:26,780
<i>and things came to a head</i>
<i>the night before the trial.</i>

155
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,360
Buster, I'm going to exhale!

156
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:29,990
No, please!

157
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:32,780
I've had, like, seven
in the past half hour.

158
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:35,410
You're not the one
staring five years in the face.

159
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:38,370
Well, right now, I'm staring at
a hundred years in the face!

160
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,210
How dare you.

161
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,590
Would you mind?

162
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,800
Be careful, defendant.

163
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,670
Remember who you're talking to.

164
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,930
It sure would be a shame
if something happened

165
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:53,350
to your pretty little
key witness.

166
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,520
Star witness.

167
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,680
And are you
threatening yourself?

168
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:59,230
Maybe I am.

169
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:03,440
<i>And losing confidence</i>
<i>in her star witness,</i>

170
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,690
<i>Lucille decided to take</i>
<i>a few keepsakes with her,</i>

171
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:09,570
<i>in case things didn't</i>
<i>go her way.</i>

172
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,370
<i>And that's when she discovered</i>

173
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,700
<i>that the family</i>
<i>she believed supported her</i>

174
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,580
<i>had actually already begun</i>
<i>divvying up her stuff,</i>

175
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,790
<i>in case she lost.</i>

176
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,380
Aw...

177
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,670
And he's supposed to be
the good one.

178
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:27,590
This does not bode well
for tomorrow.

179
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:30,340
<i>Actually, they'd claimed</i>
<i>those things years earlier</i>

180
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:33,140
<i>when she was having</i>
<i>a sunspot checked.</i>

181
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,640
<i>But she was right</i>
<i>to worry about</i>

182
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,260
<i>the turnout for the trial.</i>

183
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:39,180
Does the defense have a witness
they'd like to call?!

184
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,770
Any witness?

185
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,850
Please tell me you're working on
a strategy for us.

186
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,020
Oh. It's us now?

187
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,360
Well, we have Lucille Austero.

188
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,730
She's the only one who showed.

189
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,780
I don't think
that is good for us.

190
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:51,950
Nonsense.

191
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:53,450
- She owns the company now.
- Mm-hmm.

192
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,580
She's got as much to lose
as I do.

193
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,330
And she's a dear friend.

194
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:58,910
I'll do it myself though.

195
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,500
I need this to go well.

196
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:03,630
<i>And so it was Lucille</i>
<i>who did the questioning</i>

197
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:06,340
<i>of her new star witness,</i>
<i>Lucille 2.</i>

198
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,800
Thank you so much
for coming to be my witness.

199
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,050
You're such
a large shareholder...

200
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,630
Oh...

201
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,390
I've made a pun.

202
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:17,600
Oh, how could I not do it
for my oldest friend?

203
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,810
Oh!

204
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:21,020
Now I've gone and done a double.

205
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,310
A double.

206
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,020
Like your pre-surgery chin.

207
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,610
Or your post-breakfast drink.

208
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:28,770
Oh, I wish you'd come
to my rehab clinic.

209
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,900
But anything to help that
Keystone Cop family of yours.

210
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,360
Keystone Cops.

211
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,700
Your references are as fresh
as the wallpaper

212
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,580
in the room
of that pretend child

213
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,450
you've had all these years.

214
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,540
- But, my friend...
- You're right, I shouldn't joke.

215
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,250
None of your family showed up,
you poor thing.

216
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,830
This is such a black mark
on all of you.

217
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,750
You should know
about black marks.

218
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:51,050
Your pillow must look like
a Rorschach test.

219
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:53,680
: Not that there'd be
anyone to see it.

220
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,470
So, as I was saying...

221
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,930
<i>But unfortunately,</i>

222
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,350
<i>their 30-year</i>
<i>passive-aggressive dance</i>

223
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:01,100
<i>was losing some of its passive.</i>

224
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,140
As if everybody in this room
couldn't tell

225
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:06,900
how jealous and conniving you
are, my dear Lucille Austero.

226
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:10,690
What I knew was that you were
stealing for years-- we all did!

227
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:13,530
That's why nobody was surprised
when you stole that boat.

228
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:14,990
And I knew you couldn't wait

229
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:17,570
to get your liver-spotted claws
into my company!

230
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,830
Says the woman whose liver
can be spotted from outer space.

231
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,120
- No further questions!
- No further answers!

232
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,500
Am I done?

233
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:27,420
Oh, that's got to be
a treasure chest.

234
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,590
You think that went well?

235
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,670
I do.

236
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:33,590
<i>The judge kept Lucille on ice</i>
<i>while she awaited the verdict.</i>

237
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,340
Have you heard anything?

238
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:39,010
Well, our cashier's pregnant,
and she's not married, so...

239
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,300
I mean about me.

240
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,390
Oh, you're guilty--
three to five.

241
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,820
<i>Lucille was</i>
<i>checking in to her new home.</i>

242
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,950
Hello! Oh, Mrs. Bluth is here,
for stealing the "Queen Mary."

243
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:59,950
- We're so glad to have you here.
<i>- It was one of the so-called</i>

244
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:00,910
<i>country club prisons...</i>

245
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:03,120
So... you are here.

246
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,870
<i>...that had become popular</i>
<i>after the Enron debacle.</i>

247
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,290
...so you're gonna take
this hallway to the elevators,

248
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:08,580
and then you're gonna
want to go...

249
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,080
Slow down.

250
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:12,040
You sound like the end
of a Cymbalta commercial.

251
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:14,260
Even the lifers get confused.
Don't worry...

252
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:17,050
<i>Even though it was a nice</i>
<i>prison, it was still prison.</i>

253
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:18,430
...your choice of
fresh scent, sport,

254
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,050
or floral for your delousing.

255
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:22,600
Also, if you're
sexually assaulted by a guard...

256
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,270
A $20 gratuity is appreciated?

257
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,890
No, but press seven
on your phone.

258
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,650
If you go through the front
desk, it'll take forever.

259
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:34,860
<i>After Lucille got settled in,</i>
<i>she received a visitor.</i>

260
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,150
You missed my trial, George.

261
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:37,360
How could you?

262
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,070
I told you I was sorry.

263
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,870
I was unconscious
on the sweat lodge floor.

264
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:41,910
I lost two days.

265
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,490
I'm losing three to five years.

266
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,790
And those are the last years,
George, the best years,

267
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:48,120
where you can have sex and not
worry about getting pregnant.

268
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,460
All right, here's the good news:

269
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,130
they only got you
on stealing the boat.

270
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:53,170
They didn't even touch us
on the financial stuff.

271
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:55,250
- You're gonna get out of here.
- When?

272
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,630
Better be before the money runs
out; this place isn't cheap.

273
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:00,760
I know, and you are
running up those spa bills.

274
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,890
The same girl who hands me
towels does the cavity checks.

275
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,350
You tip.

276
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,680
Barry says he can get your
sentence reduced if...

277
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:11,150
you agree to leave here
and go to Lucille 2's

278
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,650
rehab clinic.

279
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:15,400
That's the bitch
that put me here.

280
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,490
And I'm not gonna fake having
some sort of...

281
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:20,110
I don't know-- alcohol problem--

282
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,700
just so that sterile cuckoo bird
can laugh at me.

283
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,280
I figured. Okay.

284
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:27,040
I have another idea--
now, you know China Garden?

285
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,330
I know the one by the harbor.

286
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:29,370
No, this one's a person.

287
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:30,580
And that one closed.

288
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,040
China Garden's Aunt Olive

289
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,590
is very well connected
with the Jade Triad Gang.

290
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:36,840
It's a prison gang here.

291
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,760
And believe me,
they will protect you.

292
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,840
That's a gang?

293
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,930
I thought they were
tech support.

294
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,680
<i>It turned out</i>
<i>they were a gang.</i>

295
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,890
<i>And thanks to China Garden,</i>

296
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:50,140
<i>Lucille was admitted</i>
<i>as a probationary member.</i>

297
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,770
You play mahjong before?

298
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,980
Our beach club used
to have a Jewish Day.

299
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,060
Your move, Olive Garden.

300
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,690
I can't concentrate.

301
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:59,070
Playing mahjong
without cigarette is like

302
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,150
playing video poker without...

303
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,200
cigarette.

304
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,110
Why are we not allowed to smoke

305
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,700
in this stupid prison?

306
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:08,620
<i>And that's</i>
<i>when Lucille made her move.</i>

307
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:11,540
- I know a loophole.
- Huh?

308
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,750
"Roop hore"?

309
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,580
- Roop hore.
- Roop hore.

310
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,750
<i>It was a loophole</i>
<i>that would get Lucille</i>

311
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:19,130
<i>accepted as</i>
<i>a full-fledged member</i>

312
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:21,800
<i>member of</i>
<i>the Jade Dragon Triad.</i>

313
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,550
You couldn't have chosen
a harder word to say.

314
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:28,510
<i>And soon</i>
<i>the Dragons were taking</i>

315
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,600
<i>"drags on"</i>
<i>their cigarettes again.</i>

316
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,690
There's always a way
to get what you want.

317
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:36,770
My husband is a very
powerful man, Lucille Bluth.

318
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:39,860
Perhaps we can help each other
get what we want.

319
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,280
<i>And that's how Lucille found</i>
<i>a deep-pocketed investor</i>

320
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,030
<i>to help build the wall.</i>

321
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:48,700
I got Olive Garden
to offer us unlimited bread.

322
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,750
Who better than the Chinese
to help us build a wall, right?

323
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:54,710
So the Chinese will own
a piece of the wall

324
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,080
between U.S. and Mexico?

325
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:57,840
They'll own all of it,
but they'll make us

326
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,880
very rich in the process.

327
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,510
We just need to get Michael
to sign a release.

328
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,430
He sold his shares,
but he could still claim

329
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,720
that he deserves a piece.

330
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,350
Or worse, find out
and blow the whistle.

331
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,310
Where the hell did we go wrong
with that kid?

332
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:13,060
Probably where we went wrong
with the others-- I don't know.

333
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,980
I like the plan... I just wonder

334
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,480
if we're not in that
treason-adjacent place

335
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,940
where the, uh,
government will retaliate

336
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,860
and, uh... execute us.

337
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,740
Oh, they'd never
execute a woman for this.

338
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,570
I have a good feeling
about these people.

339
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,490
Oh, that's good enough for me.

340
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:32,200
<i>But the change in the economy</i>

341
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,670
<i>led the government to put</i>
<i>the wall project on hold.</i>

342
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,040
<i>And as the months passed</i>

343
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,540
<i>and the Chinese saw</i>
<i>no progress on the wall,</i>

344
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:40,960
<i>tension mounted.</i>

345
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,800
<i>And Lucille was getting</i>
<i>more controlling.</i>

346
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,970
She said you're fat.

347
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:46,720
That's what you said, right?

348
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,010
Or does that mean something

349
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:50,760
- different in Chinese?
- No, it means "fat."

350
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:52,520
You keep causing trouble,
you're going to end up

351
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,060
- with noodles in your belly.
- I like noodles.

352
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,980
Not this way--
very hard to digest.

353
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,650
Ancient Chinese secret, huh?

354
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:01,480
It's no secret--
we'll kill you.

355
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,570
<i>- She was even being controlling</i>
- Did you get that?

356
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,820
<i>of the"R.A.P.H.O.C.W.C.P.S."</i>

357
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,530
<i>reality TV crew.</i>

358
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:09,280
Do you need a clean of
her making the threat?

359
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,870
I can lean back,
but you will come around

360
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,490
and get my reaction, yes?

361
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,910
Oh, I'll say it again--
we'll kill you.

362
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:17,250
<i>But soon</i>
<i>the threat was made real.</i>

363
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,880
Oh!
She's got a sharpened noodle!

364
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,710
She's trying to noodle-stab me!

365
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,210
Back up!

366
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:30,720
Aah, my eye!

367
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,180
This will be even more
exciting if you jump cut it.

368
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,890
Quiet!

369
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:39,350
You can't just come in and have
bread for nothing around here.

370
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,980
You have to pay bill some time.

371
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,820
<i>It wasn't a great time to find</i>
<i>out George didn't own</i>

372
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,820
<i>the right property</i>
<i>to build the wall on.</i>

373
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,610
<i>- And so a new plan emerged</i>
- Make sure Hebert Love

374
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,320
comes out against the wall...

375
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:55,910
<i>They needed the government</i>
<i>to kill the wall completely,</i>

376
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,710
<i>- but pay them anyway.</i>
- As much as I'd like to stay

377
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,870
and lay some more pipe with you,

378
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,670
I better get moving
on this thing.

379
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:02,460
We've got to make
this wall work, George.

380
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,130
We know Lucille 2
will oppose it,

381
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,510
we just have make sure
Herbert Love does.

382
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,340
Oh, don't worry-- that's
why I asked Michael for help.

383
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:11,800
Michael? What are you bringing
Michael into this for?

384
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,850
The only thing he should
be doing is signing over

385
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:14,970
his rights to the company.

386
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,520
I asked him to do this as well.

387
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,730
<i>He made it a condition</i>
<i>of the now</i>

388
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,690
<i>four favor family pact.</i>

389
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:20,940
Will you please relax?

390
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:21,900
...do something for me?

391
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,770
You know,
your mother is very hurt.

392
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:25,900
You haven't visited her.
It's like you have given up

393
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,480
- on the family business.
- I have.

394
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:29,280
Yes, but not in writing.

395
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,070
To protect all of us, visit her,

396
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,370
sign a little something
saying it's all hers.

397
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:34,700
- Will you do this, Michael?
- Yeah.

398
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,790
But I get to make you look bad

399
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,080
- in the movie, okay?
- Okay.

400
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,160
- Should we settle up?
- All right.

401
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,710
Who owes what-what to who?

402
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,080
<i>Send me some evidence</i>
<i>of a wall</i>

403
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,630
<i>I can show the Chinese.</i>

404
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,790
And the government.

405
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:46,130
We need to make
this happen, George.

406
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:48,170
The Chinese have more
than a sharpened noodle

407
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,840
with my name on it.

408
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,930
<i>And days later,</i>
<i>that evidence arrived</i>

409
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:53,340
<i>from George Sr.</i>

410
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,890
We've built this wall.

411
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:56,640
We have miles and...

412
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,810
and miles of wall, uh...

413
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,610
- There's more wall, uh...
- Dad! Dad...!

414
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:11,320
- And you know, and it feels good
to help, -It's spinning!

415
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,030
to protecting our-our border.

416
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:14,910
My God,
he Steamboat Willied it.

417
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,990
- It's a heart project.
- Dad! Dad!

418
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,410
We love America.

419
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:21,040
- We love America.
- Daddy!

420
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:27,710
<i>And that's when Lucille noticed</i>
<i>something worrisome.</i>

421
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:32,340
<i>It seemed her prison family</i>
<i>was preparing</i>

422
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:36,010
<i>for her to disappear as well.</i>

423
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,900
<i>So Lucille took matters</i>
<i>into her own hands.</i>

424
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:49,150
Well, that was fast,
you hot little...

425
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:51,650
- It's your mother. -Hi, sorry, I
thought you were somebody else.

426
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,320
I can't tell you who, 'cause
I'm-I'm dating someone famous.

427
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,780
someone... famous.

428
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,780
You better start to build
this wall built pronto.

429
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,240
I tried with your father,
but he can't do it.

430
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,160
Well, I'm kind of busy now--
I'm working with Michael.

431
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,210
What are you working on
with Michael?

432
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,870
Dad made him give me a job.

433
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,290
I see--
so he thought it was

434
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:08,630
a good idea
to have you two together.

435
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:10,130
Isn't that nice?

436
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:12,670
My God, is there anyone there
with half a brain

437
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,920
that can help me with this?

438
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:15,220
I don't know about
"half a brain,"

439
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,760
but Tobias is living
with me right now

440
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,390
and he's not very bright.

441
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:21,470
Although he is working in
the rehab where Lucille 2 is.

442
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,890
He is?

443
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:24,430
<i>And that's</i>
<i>when Lucille came up</i>

444
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,100
<i>with a plan</i>
<i>to get transferred away</i>

445
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,560
<i>from the Jade Dragon Triad.</i>

446
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,150
Hire a crew and start the wall.

447
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,650
And not a word to your brother.

448
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:32,150
I'm getting a transfer.

449
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:34,900
It's time for Mama to put on
the old drunk act.

450
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,610
That was an a...?

451
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:41,290
<i>After a call</i>
<i>to Lucille 2's rehab center,</i>

452
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:43,040
- : Lucille 2, please.
<i>- where her drunk act was</i>

453
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,580
<i>as good as you'd see</i>
<i>at the Method One Clinic...</i>

454
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,250
Fine, Lucille Austero.

455
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:49,210
<i>...Lucille was admitted</i>
<i>as a patient.</i>

456
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,540
<i>And soon met the therapist</i>

457
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:51,340
<i>who held the keys to her</i>
<i>freedom.</i>

458
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,500
You look great.

459
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,220
That suit looks
very hetero on you.

460
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:57,090
Well, thank you--
you look very hetero as well.

461
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:00,430
Now... how are you?

462
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,060
I'm as normal as blueberry pie.

463
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,310
So write that down on a form,
sign me out,

464
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,640
I won't have
to go back to prison,

465
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:10,480
and maybe you'll find a new car
parked in your driveway.

466
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,860
Oh...

467
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,070
Yes, well,
it-it doesn't work that way.

468
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:18,910
We have to have a series
of sessions, and, uh, I have to

469
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:21,410
swear in the best
of my professional opinion

470
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:23,790
that you have accepted
and made every effort

471
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:26,540
at thoughtfully reflecting
upon your weaknesses.

472
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,580
Yes!
Write down that I did that.

473
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,250
Well, no,
I-I don't work that way.

474
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,630
You don't work any way.

475
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:33,420
This is your first paying job
in ten years.

476
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,800
Oh, no, no, this doesn't pay.

477
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,630
This is part of a
work release program.

478
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:38,800
The state of California thinks
that I'm a sex offender.

479
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,510
D-D-Don't worry about what
the state of California thinks.

480
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,220
The point is we have a chance

481
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,850
to be honest with ourselves.

482
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,770
Fine-- you don't look
heterosexual in that suit.

483
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:50,150
You look as swishy
as Ryan Seacrest.

484
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,980
Ryan Seacrest is straight.

485
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,110
And I'm 40!
Sign the form.

486
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:56,280
Well, at least we have
a dialogue going.

487
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,780
Dialogue?

488
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,820
If you don't release me
you've heard the last

489
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,780
I'm going to say to you
in these sessions.

490
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,700
Fine, but you will have
to sit with me

491
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,370
for the full session.

492
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,910
Every single session.

493
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:12,250
Now, Lucille, I can't
make you talk.

494
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:14,750
But you know what I can do?

495
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,300
Hmm?

496
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:27,560
Okay, I can't trick you
into talking, either.

497
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,890
<i>This went on</i>
<i>for several sessions.</i>

498
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,780
Perhaps that's
why they call this place

499
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:42,950
Au-stare-ity.

500
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:46,410
No?

501
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:51,120
Au-stare-i...

502
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:52,250
Fine.

503
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,290
Well, if you're
not going to talk,

504
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:54,540
I'm just going to...

505
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,460
- write this up.
<i>- Earlier that day,</i>

506
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,510
<i>Tobias had encountered</i>
<i>a plot problem</i>

507
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:00,380
<i>with the</i>
<i>"Fantastic Four"musical.</i>

508
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,590
A villain.

509
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:03,220
I was thinking the same thing.

510
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,970
I mean, why aren't the
Fantastic Four fighting anyone.

511
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:07,680
Instead of just
dancing around, you mean.

512
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,850
Right, it's like all Sharks
and no Jets.

513
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:11,890
Then we would have a second act.

514
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,560
Lucia, right?

515
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,060
I mean, that's their foe.

516
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,440
Lucia Von Bardass?

517
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:20,650
Have you guys ever
even read one of these things?

518
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:23,070
<i>So Tobias was glad for the</i>
<i>break in Lucille's sessions.</i>

519
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,110
- ...to do this right?
<i>- So that he could work on it.</i>

520
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,620
I mean, really right.

521
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:28,040
This woman is a villain.

522
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,410
You think I'm a villain, too?

523
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:30,700
- No...
- My children

524
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,250
are all waiting for me to die

525
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,750
so they can divvy up my stuff,

526
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,710
my Chinese gang mates were
getting ready

527
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,380
to noodle stab me,
and even one of the guards

528
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,420
called me "Gangie,"
and he was talking

529
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,800
about the monster movie.

530
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,260
He thinks that horrible
monster looks like me!

531
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,760
So fine, you want to call me
a villain, I accept it!

532
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,060
I'm your villain!

533
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,270
Uh, actually I was writing down

534
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,310
a casting breakdown

535
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,100
for the role of Lucia

536
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,900
for my "Fantastic Four" musical.

537
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:57,860
This was all
about your stupid play?

538
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,480
I was about to cry

539
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,650
for the first time in 60 years.

540
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:04,200
I remember when
the last time was, too.

541
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,160
I hid under Mama's porch
during a thunderstorm...

542
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,370
: and I found
the remains of my ostri...

543
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:11,870
It's not a stupid play.

544
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:13,410
It's a musical.

545
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,750
And I have to debut it

546
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,330
on a boat at Cinco.

547
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,880
It's on a boat?

548
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,420
Take to the sea!

549
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,880
Yes, I'll sign everyone out
for the night,

550
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,220
but I guess I'll have to play
the old sea bitch myself.

551
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,840
I'm in.

552
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,550
Really?

553
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,140
Well, that's wonderful.

554
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,140
Well, I think we have made
a breakthrough today.

555
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,270
In the musical, not you.

556
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:38,020
Oh, God, no, there's miles
of work to do with you.

557
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:40,610
<i>But, of course,</i>
<i>he would make her audition.</i>

558
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:42,690
<i>So Lucille wrote a song</i>
<i>from the heart.</i>

559
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:44,360
♪ My children despise me ♪

560
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,990

561
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,570

Wonderful.

570
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:04,510
Terrifying.

571
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:05,550
Isn't she?

572
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,800
Betty, you can leave.

573
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,640
Lucille, would you please stay?

574
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,510
<i>But staying was the last thing</i>
<i>Lucille had in mind.</i>

575
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,970
Hello?

576
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,980
I want to be with you;
I... I have needs.

577
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:15,930
George, is that you?

578
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,480
<i>It wasn't.</i>

579
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,060
<i>It was Oscar who,</i>
<i>living as George,</i>

580
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:22,190
<i>and feeling more amorous...</i>

581
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:25,570
<i>...went to visit Lucille 2</i>
<i>for an afternoon delight.</i>

582
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:27,820
<i>When she wasn't there,</i>
<i>he found her work number.</i>

583
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:28,910
Austerity.

584
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,320
Lucille 2, please?

585
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:32,330
<i>But, of course, at Austerity,</i>

586
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:34,740
<i>- this woman is Lucille 2.</i>
- Hello.

587
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:36,750
I want to be with you;
I... I have needs.

588
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,330
George, is that you?

589
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:40,580
<i>But a newly virile Oscar</i>
<i>figured, in a pinch,</i>

590
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:42,460
<i>any Lucille would do.</i>

591
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,920
Yes, this is George.
Where are you?

592
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,510
I'm in rehab, you know that.

593
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:49,130
Why don't I swing by,
and we can conjugate?

594
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,760
Let's do our business
over the phone.

595
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,720
May not have a lot of time,
but, uh, all right, here goes:

596
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,930
I want to pull your panties
off with my...

597
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,440
Real business, George.

598
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,650
I'd very much like to pull your
underwear off with my teeth...

599
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,070
No-- at Cinco,

600
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:05,530
we're getting on a boat,
we're leaving the country.

601
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:07,030
But what about love?

602
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:10,200
Easy-- Gene Parmesan
got photos of Herbert Love

603
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,410
with some redheaded whore.

604
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:14,870
I'm giving his wife a taste,
so he knows we know.

605
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:18,160
If he wins, we should be able to
get him to do whatever we want

606
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:19,790
with that wall now.

607
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:20,830
I'm not completely following...

608
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:22,420
Oop. Hold on.

609
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,380
<i>And that's when Lucille finally</i>
<i>had a visit from her son.</i>

610
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,420
- Hello.
- Michael Bluth here to see you.

611
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,960
Send him up.

612
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:30,090
- ...with my teeth.
- Michael's here.

613
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:31,590
- Oh...
- This is my chance to make sure

614
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,260
he doesn't get
too cozy with Gob.

615
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,390
- Why?
- Bad things happen

616
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:37,100
when brothers collude.

617
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,150
When can we have sex?

618
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:44,400
After Cinco.

619
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,150
Cinco?

620
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:48,780
Just get a boat ready,
we'll make our getaway.

621
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,700
So not... not today.

622
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:54,240
<i>And that's when she saw Michael</i>
<i>for the first time</i>

623
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,620
<i>since the last time</i>
<i>he left the family.</i>

624
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,990
Wow.

625
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,460
This is a step up from prison.

626
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,040
How would you know?

627
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,630
You haven't come
to visit me once.

628
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:03,630
Yeah. Sorry.

629
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:05,040
I feel bad about that.

630
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:06,710
So you're here to make amends?

631
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:09,300
Because you know your mother
will always take you back.

632
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,880
And because
I know my mother wants me

633
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:14,180
to sign away any connection
to the family business.

634
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,180
I just need a signature.

635
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,760
I'm happy to help.
If...

636
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:19,100
- you do something for me.
- For me.

637
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,440
Yeah, I heard
that's been happening.

638
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,690
I'm happy to help you, honey.

639
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,690
Me, too.

640
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:28,400
<i>And that's how Michael got his</i>
<i>mother's rights to the movie.</i>

641
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,940
<i>But not right away.</i>

642
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:43,330
So happy to help.

643
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:44,330
Me, too.

644
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:46,750
- So, everything else is good?
- Yeah.

645
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:49,250
You've talked to your sister,
the radical?

646
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,300
Yeah. She's a redhead now,
and she's dating Herbert Love,

647
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,090
but other than her looks
and her belief system,

648
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:54,590
- Oh...
- she's the same old Lindsay.

649
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,470
So that's Lindsay in the photo.

650
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:59,180
And I hear you're dating
an actress...

651
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,680
who's also dating Ron Howard?

652
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:03,230
No, no...
no, no, no, no, no, no.

653
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:05,400
She is not dating
Ron Howard, Mother.

654
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,650
Ron Howard is her father, okay?

655
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:10,150
Your mind...

656
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:12,320
I did, though, actually
find out who she is dating.

657
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,320
<i>Michael had found out,</i>
<i>earlier that day,</i>

658
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,780
<i>when he visited</i>
<i>her apartment to head off</i>

659
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:20,410
<i>any ill feelings</i>
<i>she might have about this...</i>

660
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:21,870
I'll do everything
in my power to make sure

661
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:23,080
she never dates you again.

662
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,120
<i>Or this...</i>

663
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,370
You are ruining
my life, Ron Howard!

664
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,540
Nice, right?

665
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,000
Is too big.

666
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,300
She likes small.

667
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,210
Can I please have ice cream?

668
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:35,430
No, no, you are a Depardieu.
No sweets.

669
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:37,510
Getting excited about Cinco?

670
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:40,890
Your Cinco, not ours.

671
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:47,310
<i>Michael wasn't proud</i>
<i>of what he was about to do.</i>

672
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:49,400
Hey, Lem, I can reach
the ice cream and, you know,

673
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,900
in my family,
we play a game called

674
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:54,610
"If You Do Something For Me."

675
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:56,110
Rules are meant
to be broken, huh?

676
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:59,280
I will give you this Dove bar,
if you do something for me.

677
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,620
We have Dove bars?

678
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,410
We do. Look at that.

679
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:06,420
Tell me what you know
about this "George Maharis."

680
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,370
Not much.

681
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,460
He's old.

682
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,790
Is he older than me?

683
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:11,040
A few years.

684
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:12,420
He looks like you.

685
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:15,380
So, handsome.

686
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,760
<i>And that's when Lucille</i>
<i>found a way</i>

687
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,640
<i>to keep the brothers</i>
<i>from colluding.</i>

688
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,300
George Maharis.

689
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:23,310
George--
that's your brother's name.

690
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,890
George Oscar Bluth.

691
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:28,600
Yes, uh, George
is Gob's first name, yep.

692
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:29,980
<i>And that's when Michael</i>

693
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,940
<i>remembered something else</i>
<i>strange.</i>

694
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,400
I probably should have
expected that.

695
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:38,410
<i>And then stranger...</i>

696
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:40,240
"Love each other..."

697
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,370
Oh, that definitely
sounds like Gob.

698
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:45,200
<i>And he did say he was</i>
<i>seeing someone famous...</i>

699
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:46,660
...dating someone famous.

700
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:49,120
<i>And Michael remembered</i>
<i>hearing about that, as well.</i>

701
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:51,080
Me doth think he hath a lady.

702
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:54,550
- Oh. -And they're both
a bit of celebrities.

703
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:57,220
Well, that is odd, because I,
I'm also dating a celebrity.

704
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,470
If I were you,
I'd put a tail on him.

705
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:00,300
Get a P.I.

706
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,680
Where the hell
am I gonna find a P.I.?

707
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,100
Gene Parmesan...

708
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,770
at your service.

709
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:07,770
Gene!

710
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:09,890
He does this to me every time!

711
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,060
- What's he doing here, Mom?
- Oh, he's working for me.

712
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:13,060
Why'd you scream, then?

713
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:16,530
I thought he was that guy.

714
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,910
Mm.

715
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,080
<i>At Lucille's behest,</i>

716
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,200
<i>Michael borrowed the family</i>
<i>P.I. to follow his brother.</i>

717
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:29,290
He just drove by. Pick me up.

718
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:31,880
This is the great disguise, huh?

719
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,250
Fry cook!

720
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:35,170
Oh, no, no,
this is my horrible night job.

721
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:37,300
In fact, I was hoping
you could drop me off

722
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,970
at Chicken Dan's
when we're all done.

723
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:40,010
Chicken Dan's, huh?

724
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:41,590
That is embarrassing.

725
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,760
This from a man who's driving
around a mapping car?

726
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,680
You know, I don't even think
these things work.

727
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,640
That's why I rely
on these babies right here--

728
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,980
the old binocs.

729
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,100
Let's see if we can't find
this target.

730
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:53,150
You know, the great thing
about these is,

731
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:55,860
there's no software to update...

732
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,610
- Oh, God, what are you doing?
- Sorry.

733
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:59,280
Oh, these binoculars
make me nauseous.

734
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,450
Well, of course they do.

735
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:01,950
Why don't you just use the maps?

736
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:04,570
- No. -We're in
a satellite-linked mapping car.

737
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:07,410
No, no. Sometimes
the old ways are the...

738
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:08,660
- Hey.
- You-you better pull over.

739
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,870
- All right, hang on.
- Pull over!

740
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:11,290
One, two.

741
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:12,330

DeBrie, you might have missed
a step, so...

756
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:39,110
- Sorry. I think I might...
I hurt my leg. -Oh.

757
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,860
And so, I need some, mm,
Tylenol with c-codeine?

Or maybe
a little morphie morph?

759
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:45,410
No. DeBrie, come on.

760
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:47,240
Don't you want to get back
on that horse?

761
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,830
Even better!

762
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:50,700
<i>She was the best</i>
<i>villain casting</i>

763
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:53,580
<i>since Shirley MacClain</i>
<i>in"Gangie Four."</i>

764
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,420

<i>Lucille's escape plans</i>

766
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,000
<i>got a step closer</i>
<i>to completion.</i>

767
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:02,300
<i>Oscar did indeed borrow a boat</i>
<i>and left it idling,</i>

768
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:06,180
<i>which unfortunately, was what</i>
<i>this man was looking for.</i>

769
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,720
<i>And Lucille slipped away</i>
<i>from the cast,</i>

770
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,060
<i>looking for her husband.</i>

771
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,690
There you are!

772
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:15,850
What are you doing here?

773
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,770
What do you mean,
what am I doing here?

774
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:19,570
We made plans...
to escape on the boat!

775
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:21,740
I never made plans with you.

776
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:25,360
But we talked
about it on the phone,

777
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:27,120
when you were trying
to talk dirty to me.

778
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,580
- Oh.
- What is wrong with you?

779
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,450
This is... this is embarrassing.
Full disclosure.

780
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:31,950
Uh, that was Oscar,

781
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
who may have been the one
you were talking with.

782
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,210
He's been filling in...
for me occasionally.

783
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:40,880
Filling in?
As in, visiting me?

784
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,720
You sent your brother
to have sex with me?

785
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,430
No, I sent him to listen to you

786
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:47,470
one time, and then,
he found out about the wall,

787
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:49,140
and tried to get you
talking about it,

788
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:51,970
and this was his way
of shutting you up.

789
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,180
- He told you this?
- No, you told me

790
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,560
when I visited.

791
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,440
I got in there
a couple of times... too.

792
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,940
Oh, but not for sex.

793
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,860
I don't have the tiger
in my tank anymore.

794
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,650
Maybe I do need a vacay.

795
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:05,030
So, tell me about this trip.

796
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,780
That's interesting.
Where we going?

797
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,410
I'll tell you where we're going.

798
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:09,950
We're going to court.

799
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:12,080
We're getting a real divorce.

800
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,540
You're out of the marriage.

801
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,410
Lucille...?

802
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:19,670
<i>And that's when she came</i>
<i>face to face with the man...</i>

803
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:21,340
<i>...whose face</i>
<i>she'd just faced...</i>

804
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,010
- Are you ready?
<i>...but it was a different...</i>

805
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:24,630
<i>- It-it was Oscar.</i>
- Hello, Oscar.

806
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:26,720
You should get an Oscar
for your portrayal of George

807
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,760
in "Screw the Oblivious
Sister-in-law."

808
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,810
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

809
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:32,890
You-you got me.

810
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:34,770
I was gon...
I was gonna tell you.

811
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:37,060
I was acting
when I pretended to be George,

812
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:39,230
but I am dead serious when I say

813
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:42,860
you are the hottest woman
I know.

814
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:47,700
I'm here tonight because
I want to run away with you.

815
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,240
Oscar. Really?

816
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,990
Of course. What?

817
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:53,740
Do you think I'm here for the
donkey punch? Which I do love,

818
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:55,750
and it's the only night
you can get it.

819
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:58,830
But you are the only woman
for me, Lucille!

820
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:02,290
Bring me those thin,
pot-stained lips.

821
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,050
Oh, honey.

822
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,630
- What's this?
- I have no idea.

823
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:09,180
<i>And that's when she found out</i>
<i>the latest thing</i>

824
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,260
<i>that was hers</i>
<i>that had been claimed.</i>

825
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,810
<i>He'd actually acquired it</i>
<i>earlier that night</i>

826
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:15,930
<i>when he was... polling</i>
<i>for Lucille 2.</i>

827
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:18,430
- That, um...
- She's claimed you!

828
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,690
Everyone I know wants
to take everything away from me!

829
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:21,940
No! That's not true.

830
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,270
I love you.

831
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:25,190
I don't know if it's the maca.

832
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,940
I've just been so randy lately.

833
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:29,280
But you're...

834
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,570
you...

835
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:32,320
you're my kind of Lucille!

836
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:33,580
Get away from me, you liar.

837
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,700
I can't believe
you were with her.

838
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,370
She's finished.

839
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:39,870
And the Oscar goes, too!

840
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,250
To...?

841
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:42,710
Get out of my sight!

842
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,040
<i>She was in an emotional storm</i>

843
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:46,090
<i>and could have used</i>
<i>a therapist.</i>

844
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:48,050
- Oh, my God...
- Lucille!

845
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:50,050
<i>- When she ran into a therapist</i>
- Where are you going?

846
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:51,680
<i>who could've used a storm.</i>

847
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,180
To disappear.

848
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,100
That's what everyone
wants me to do.

849
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:58,060
Lucille!

850
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,270
You are not the villain.

851
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:04,150
I'm so tired
of being the villain.

852
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:05,650
Well, those days are over.

853
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:08,820
What you are
is the Invisible Girl.

854
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,490
You make it impossible
for people

855
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:12,320
to see you in order
to protect yourself.

856
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,870
<i>And somehow, in that moment,</i>

857
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:15,280
<i>something changed for her.</i>

858
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,700
I do do that.

859
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,620
And in this way, you launch

860
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,370
sneak attacks,
and you create a force field

861
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:21,790
to keep people away.

862
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:23,830
Right! I'm not a villain.

863
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,590
I'm the Invisible Girl!

864
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:27,130
Yes, that's what I'm saying!

865
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:30,380
Oh, you know, it's funny...
I never would have

866
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:33,640
come to this if it hadn't been
for Lucille 2's rehab.

867
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:37,180
I need to pay her back
for everything she's done to me.

868
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:40,140
I'm going back to rehab.

869
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:44,100
I just have
to make one quick stop first.

870
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:45,810
I don't think we have time.

871
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,440
<i>And that's the night</i>
<i>that Lucille decided</i>

872
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,940
<i>she didn't want</i>
<i>to be invisible anymore.</i>

873
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,690
I've got to do this...

874
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:53,160
<i>And perhaps, ironically,</i>
<i>it was also</i>

875
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,620
<i>the night that Lucille 2</i>
<i>became the Invisible Girl.</i>

876
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,830
<i>Tobias boards the boat</i>

877
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:05,960
<i>originally meant</i>
<i>for Lucille's escape,</i>

878
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,710
<i>and after making one stop,</i>
<i>faces the awful truth.</i>

879
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:13,260
They're going to be talking
about this bomb for years.

880
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,550
Oh, God, it is bad, isn't it?

881
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:17,760
Lindsay was right
to discourage me.

882
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,640
- Tobias?
- Marky?

883
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,730
If you're not Lindsay,
then where is Lindsay?

884
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:25,190
Isn't that her
on the love boat?

885
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:27,860
- But I just put a bomb
on the love boat! -What?!

886
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,400
- Lindsay! Lindsay!
- Lindsay! Lindsay!

887
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,730
Lindsay, there's a bomb!

888
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:34,570
<i>Lindsay remembers</i>
<i>she's on a boat...</i>

889
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:35,490
Oh, (bleep)

890
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:37,570
<i>...that Marky had intended</i>
<i>to bomb.</i>

891
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,330
You gotta get off the boat!

892
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:40,740
<i>And it turns out</i>
<i>to be kind of romantic.</i>

893
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:42,830
Bomb!

894
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:48,790
<i>...that Lindsay and Tobias</i>
<i>have matching suitcases.</i>

895
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:59,520
