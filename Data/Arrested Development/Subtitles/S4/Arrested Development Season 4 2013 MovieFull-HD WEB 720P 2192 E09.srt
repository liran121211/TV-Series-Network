00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:13,940
<i>The Austerity Clinic</i>
<i>was a well-known rehab facility</i>

2
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,900
<i>that, on this particular day,</i>

3
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,940
<i>was about to get</i>
<i>a new therapist.</i>

4
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:22,320
Hello, everyone,
I am Dr. Tobias Funke

5
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,530
and I will be your therapist.

6
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:26,990
Yes, I'm getting to that.

7
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,990
And I am also
a registered sex offender.

8
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,490
Now, let's have a wrap-about.

9
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,540
I am here because...

10
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:38,420
Lucille Austero has given me
the opportunity

11
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,210
to pay my debt to society.

12
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,010
- I'm doing this pro bono...
- <i>Although technically</i>

13
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,880
<i>it was society that owed him,</i>
<i>as he was the victim</i>

14
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:46,300
<i>of a merry mix-up.</i>

15
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,800
Is there a little girl here
all by herself?

16
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:50,350
Daddy needs to get his rocks...

17
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,140
<i>We don't have</i>
<i>to hear this again,</i>

18
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,850
<i>but he was arrested</i>
<i>despite his innocence.</i>

19
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,640
Oh, hey, Officers,
are you here for the raccoon?

20
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,350
Oh, no, I'm not a raccoon,
I'm...

21
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,560
<i>Because, instead</i>

22
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:01,280
<i>of asking for a lawyer...</i>

23
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,110
<i>...this creep chose to ask</i>

24
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,320
<i>about a more pressing matter.</i>

25
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,780
Oh, is this going to be
SAG or AFTRA?

26
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,110
<i>And for the first time,</i>

27
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,530
<i>Tobias started</i>
<i>to get recognized</i>

28
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:11,580
<i>for his television work.</i>

29
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,660
Oh, no, no, that's not
representative of who I am.

30
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,660
- Anus tart.
- Yep, that's me.

31
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,500
<i>Fortunately</i>
<i>Tobias, who had once</i>

32
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,340
<i>turned down an offer</i>
<i>from Lucille 2...</i>

33
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:25,010
- How would you like to come work
for me at Austerity? -Hmm... no.

34
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,430
- Hmm...-<i>... had, after</i>
<i>a particularly vicious beating</i>

35
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:30,350
<i>with a soup ladle,</i>
<i>changed his tune...</i>

36
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,890
<i>but didn't want</i>
<i>to look too eager.</i>

37
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:34,310
Yes.

38
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,100
I'm also an analyst
and a therapist,

39
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,730
which makes me...

40
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:42,770
<i>Prison had taught Tobias</i>
<i>at least one thing...</i>

41
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,820
...a theralyst.

42
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,110
Now, let's have a wrap-about,

43
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,570
and what we'll do is just
take a comfy pose.

44
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,490
I want everybody just to sit
back and relax where they are

45
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,580
and let's learn
about each other

46
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,460
and let's find out about each...

47
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,120
Oh, my goodness.

48
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:02,750
Wow, well, uh, it seems as if
we are amongst royalty here.

49
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,090
I-I'm sorry, how old are you?

50
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,840
- 23. -Ah, well within my rights.

51
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,090
Yes, why don't you, uh, take
the comfortable chair?

52
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,510
And, um, and we're going

54
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,230
Hi, I'm Mark.

No, no, Mark Cherry,
I was, I was having fun.

59
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,910
I, I have a bit of a wit.

60
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:36,040
Sometimes I have to tell people
'cause they can't figure it out

61

that I...

But, please, Mr. Cherry,

63
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,580
So I got involved with drugs,

64
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,550
and there were bees
and drinking and...

65
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:49,090

179
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:20,030
<i>It's Tobias'</i>
Arrested Development.

180
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,120
<i>Tobias had found a way to spend</i>
<i>time with the woman he loved.</i>

181
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,540
Please, DeBrie,
you've got to do this.

182
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,460
<i>Now he just had</i>
<i>to talk her into it.</i>

183
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,880
I mean, this could be good for
you and it could be a huge hit

184
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,960
and it's really the only way
they're gonna keep us together.

185
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,340
They won't let me be
your therapist,

186
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,090
but they'll let me be
your director.

187
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:45,800
I want the world to be able
to see this angel face.

188
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:47,760
- Oh.
- Oh, oh, dear.

189
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:50,140
Well, that's a good luck sign
on Broadway.

190
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,060
On the East Coast it's "break
a leg," on the West Coast it's

191
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,690
- "lose a tooth."<i>-And so,</i>
<i>excited that he'd found a way</i>

192
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:55,440
<i>- to both be with DeBrie...</i>
- Let's get you some epoxy.

193
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,650
<i>- ...and help her recovery,</i>
<i>Tobias went...</i>-Beard!

194
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,150
<i>...to Sudden Valley.</i>

195
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:02,070
Beard, I'm only here
to pick up my car keys.

196
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,740
Tobias?

197
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,740
Gob?

198
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,990
Good to see you, old friend.

199
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,290
What have you been up to?

200
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:12,660
Oh, uh, things are good,
nothing much.

201
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:13,910
I'm a registered sex offender,

202
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,500
- but things are good.
- Yes, yes.

203
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,540
And I'm working
at Lucille 2's rehab center--

204
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:21,170
the one she owns, not the one
she famously went to 12 times.

205
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,970
Can we finish this up
over breakfast? I'm starving.

206
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:25,050
Oh, is it finishing?
Okay.

207
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:26,760
<i>And the two friends caught up.</i>

208
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,640
But if I wouldn't have gotten
arrested, I wouldn't have

209
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,100
ended up working at the rehab

210
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,970
and I wouldn't have reconnected
with my love.

211
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,020
True, I can't ethically ravage
her body.

212
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,060
I have to leave that
to time, but

213
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,190
she's just so much fun
to be with.

214
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,690
I too am in a relationship,

215
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:41,530
but this person is
sort of a celebrity.

216
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:45,320
Well, turns out my femme fatale
is a bit of a celebrity herself.

217
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,620
Well, looks like life is going
pretty well for both of us,

218
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,950
except that I'm broke.

219
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,490
And I'm a sex offender.

220
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,870
Michael expects me to sell

221
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,250
these split-level death traps.

222
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,290
And how am I
supposed to do that?

223
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,670
I mean, there are no schools
or libraries or Internet

224
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,590
or playgrounds
within 20 miles of here.

225
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:05,550
You know, it's funny, I've been
looking for a place to live,

226
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:08,050
and that fills virtually
every parole requirement I have.

227
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,100
That's great.

228
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,350
When can you move in?

229
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:12,930
Uh, duh. Now.

230
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,810
<i>And with his living</i>
<i>arrangements taken care of,</i>

231
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:17,060
<i>Tobias returned to his</i>
<i>court-appointed work-release.</i>

232
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,610
One, two, three, four, five...

233
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:21,400
<i>And so began</i>
<i>an intense workshop to create</i>

234
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,190
<i>the</i>Fantastic Four<i>musical,</i>
<i>written and directed by Tobias.</i>

235
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,490
Now, the script is in process,
but the goal is

236
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:30,200
that we all get a little outing
on the Cinco de Cuatro,

237
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,540
where we'll be performing it
on a boat.

238
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,290
I hope no one gets seasick.

239
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:38,170
Okay. And Mark Cherry is going
to be doing the music for us.

240
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,790
And this will make
my stay shorter, right?

241
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,380
I'll get out of here
a week sooner?

242
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,550
Well, sobriety is
the most important thing,

243
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,920
but we'll see
how good the music is.

244
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:47,220
<i>Tobias inspired the troops.</i>

245
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,550
All right, let's get up!

246
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,640
<i>And after some</i>
<i>initial trepidation,</i>

247
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,010
<i>Argyle set to work</i>
<i>with the choreography.</i>

248
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,310
Back, step.

249
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:55,770
Out, back, step, back, step.

250
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:57,310
Out-- now, try that.

251
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:59,650
Out, back, step, shuffle...

252
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:01,440
<i>And even though</i>
<i>DeBrie had some trouble</i>

253
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,780
<i>with the choreography</i>
<i>at first...</i>

254
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,230
- ...shuffle, step.
- DeBrie! -DeBrie!

255
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,610
- Oh, God.
- Are you all right?

256
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:07,900
- Yeah, yeah.
- Baby steps, Argyle.

257
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,320
She's brittle.

258
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,410
Tobias, it does not
get babier than this.

259
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:13,280
- Maybe I can't do this.
- You can do it.

260
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:15,200
Tobias, I can do it.
I used to be a hoofer.

261
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,080

<i>Tobias had no doubt</i>

263
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,590

319
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:33,510

production

Hey! I can whistle.

324
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,680
Ooh, we have to use that
in the show.

325
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:45,690
Now what if, say, I could raise
between $50 and $100?

326
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,810
How much of the remainder
could you generate?

327
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:51,440
Well, if my sister could call in
some debts, probably all of it.

328
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,990
- Oh.
- But that means

329
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:55,820
we'd have to use
the Cinco show as a preview,

330
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,120
and she would want to know
that we have the rights.

331
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,490
Of course, of course.

332
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,540
Wait a minute.
We don't have the rights?

333
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,160
Well, not yet.

334
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,960
Not yet, but I was
going to ask you about that.

335
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,370
Who produced the one
you were in?

336
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:09,000
Uh, I think
it's Imagine Generic.

337
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,540
Ron Howard's company.

338
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:13,210
<i>Imagine Generic</i>

00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:21,680
Three of us?

343
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,600
Houston, we're having a baby.

344
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,440
<i>I don't want</i>
<i>to get arrested again</i>

345
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,860
because we don't
have the rights.

346
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:32,900
Okay, no, all right.

347
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,530
No, no! All right. Settle down.

348
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:36,150
Settle down.
This has happened to

349
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,870
every Broadway show in
the history of Broadway shows.

350
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:43,660
And I swear I shall
acquire the rights.

351
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,710
<i>So Tobias went to do so,</i>

352
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,830
<i>as Argyle set a dinner date</i>
<i>with his sister</i>

353
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,920
<i>at the Balboa Club...</i>

354
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,960
- Imagine Entertainment.
- Oh!

355
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,960
<i>...on the same night</i>
<i>that Michael's date, Rebel,</i>

356
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:55,920
<i>was finding her father's</i>
<i>character under attack.</i>

357
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:58,010
...uh, Ron is not
like that at all.

358
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:00,260
<i>Of course, Michael thought</i>
<i>Ron was Rebel's boyfriend.</i>

359
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,970
In fact,
he's almost too generous.

360
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,350
Sounds like the Ron Howard

361
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,680
Man of the Year Awards, though,
you know?

362
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,680
<i>And the evening broke up</i>

363
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,140
<i>of its own accord.</i>

364
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,020
- My son is sick, so...
- Oh, no.

365
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,350
I have to go.

366
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,730
Rebel.

367
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:13,730
Rebel, let me come.
I'm great with kids.

368
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,230
It's not about the kid.

369
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,780
I'm not comfortable here.

370
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,700
Okay. Are you off to see him?

371
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,160
Listen, if you've got a problem
with me seeing other people,

372
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,570
why don't you just
come out and say it?

373
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,830
No, no, no, I can.

374
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,330
What do you mean?
I can handle that.

375
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:25,830
We'll see each other a la carte,
you know?

376
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,080
Like the $18 baked potato

377
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,960
you ordered
that you didn't touch.

378
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,960
Yeah, you're not comfortable.

379
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,250
Yeah, no, well, listen.

380
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:33,250
Rebel, Rebel.

381
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:34,290
Fine. See you later.

382
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,130
Say hi to Ron Howard for me.

383
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:38,010
<i>And perhaps because neither</i>
<i>Michael nor Lindsay</i>

384
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:40,840
<i>could handle rejection,</i>
<i>they blamed each other.</i>

385
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:42,300
Well, hope you're happy.
My girlfriend left,

386
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,680
'cause she can't stand
your right-wing

387
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,220
American scallop-eating
boyfriend.

388
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:48,100
Well, he left because
your chirpy little actress

389
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,940
- couldn't keep her mouth shut.
- That's it.

390
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,520
Know what?
You're out of the movie.

391
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,060
Fine.

392
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:55,650
- Good night.
- Good night.

393
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:58,610
<i>And with his evening freed up,</i>
<i>Michael reached out to a son</i>

394
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:00,280
<i>- he'd earlier blown off.</i>
- Good night.

395
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,320
George Michael, hey.

396
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,620
Got out of it.

397
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,910
I just-- I made
a ton of people angry,

398
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,910
family...

399
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:09,120
Well, ah, gosh,
you know, I really wanted to,

400
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,370
uh, do that, but I just had
this work thing come up.

401
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,170
And, uh, it's like
you always say:

402
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:16,800
family first,
unless there's a work thing,

403
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,260
and then work first.

404
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,840
I have said that, too.

405
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,220
Well, I've got politics
and producing stuff I can...

406
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,550
<i>After being kicked out</i>
<i>of his son's dorm</i>

407
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,350
<i>and stood up</i>
<i>at the Ealing Club,</i>

408
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:29,600
<i>this particular rejection</i>
<i>really hurt.</i>

409
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,980
Another time.

410
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,810
<i>But he tried to put on</i>
<i>a brave face</i>

411
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:35,020
<i>when he ran into a woman</i>
<i>he was in debt to.</i>

412
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,110
- Who is this?
- Oh, this is

413
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,280
my baby brother, Argyle.

414
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,940
And here's the family joke:

415
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:42,780
I'm a tall drink of water,
and he's the chaser.

416
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,120
Should be flipped, right?

417
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,000
No, because here's another joke:
you owe my sister

418
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,000
$700,000, and I'm going to
chase you down until you pay up.

419
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,040
And if you don't pay up
by the fourth,

420
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,500
you're gonna be washing up

421
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:59,010
with the rest of
the broken piñatas on the fifth.

422
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:00,420
Lucille!

423
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,420
Oh, hello.

424
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,760
Who's-- ow, ow!

425
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,260
God, what is on the bottom
of those shoes?

426
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,640
Taps.

427
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,310
And I can tap dance
all over your face,

428
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,720
if you know what I mean.

429
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,020
Even if my heart won't

430
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,730
snap back into place.

431
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,650
I don't know what you meant
with the last part there.

432
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:17,150
I'll chase you down
and find you, Michael.

433
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:19,270
You can't hide
in a gorilla suit from me.

434
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:24,070
♪<i>Mr. F.</i>♪

435
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,570
<i>Argyle was wrong on that count.</i>

436
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,990

438

Any progress on the rights?

439
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,750
I'm in talks with Imagine.

440
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:35,880
<i>Well, kinda.</i>

441
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,290
<i>Ron Howard's office.</i>

442
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,090
Yes, this is Tobias Funke.

443
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:41,670
I'm a registered sex offender,

444
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,550
and I'd like to talk to Ron...

445
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:46,220
Well, then you're gonna have
to work with our new patient,

446
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,510
and good luck with her.

447
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:49,720
We call her the "B" word
from the "C" ward.

448
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,060
Or is it the "C" word
from the "B" ward?

449
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:57,560
<i>And that's when</i>
<i>Tobias got some more bad news.</i>

450
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,400
Hello, anus tart.

451
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,360
<i>And she never even saw</i>
<i>the license plate.</i>

452
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:07,280
<i>Tobias had no way</i>
<i>of being around DeBrie</i>

453
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:10,330
<i>without the rights</i>
<i>to</i>Fantastic Four.

454
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:14,040
<i>And that's when he ran into</i>
<i>an equally worried Michael.</i>

455
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,000
You okay?

456
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,790
Michael.

457
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,920
What a pleasant surprise.

458
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,170
Please, make yourself at home.

459
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:22,670
I am. I'm home.

460
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:25,550
This is my-- I own
all the homes here, actually.

461
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:27,800
And Gob's supposed to be
selling these, so...

462
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,050
Where is he? Do you know?

463
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,140
Oh, out and about.

464
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,640
Me doth think he hath a lady.

465
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,680
- As doth I dooth.
- Oh.

466
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:37,060
And they're both
bit of, uh, celebrities.

467
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,020
Well, that is odd, because
I-I'm also dating a celebrity.

468
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,980
Oh, perchance a double date
is in our future,

469
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,940
- eh, brother-in-law?
- I don't...

470
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,030
Tell me about her.

471
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,530
I-- you know, I-I don't think

472
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:49,120
that-that you're the best one
to talk to

473
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,410
about my relationship
difficulties.

474
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:53,040
Fair enough.

475
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,460
It's only what I do
for a living, Michael.

476
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,920
What I'm trained to do.

477
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,800
- Well, let-let me tell you
a little bit about her. -Okay.

478
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,300
So it's a simple choice, really.

479
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,590
If I keep seeing her,

480
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,180
he'll find out
and kill the movie.

481
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,510
So I either keep the girl
and lose the movie,

482
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,760
or I keep the movie,
lose the girl.

483
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:15,810
But the whole reason that I did
the movie was to get the girl.

484
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:16,850
It's...

485
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,020
Michael, I appreciate
your bravery.

486
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,900
And I know
everything seems doomed now--

487
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,190
and believe me, I'm in
a similar situation myself--

488
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:28,360
but trust me...

489
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,530
...we are .

490
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:31,700
You're .

491
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,490
I mean, unless some sort of
miracle coincidence happens.

492
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:39,790
But, no, the best thing to do
is just walk away,

493
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:42,960
and we'll lick
each other's wounds.

494
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,210
I guess I'm just going
to have to give up my dream

495
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,550
and my love forever.

496
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:50,380
I think I should just go tell
Ron Howard that it is over.

497
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,180
Yes. R-Ron Howard?

498
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,680
- Ron Howard's making this movie?
- Yeah.

499
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,600
Michael, you can't just
walk away from this.

500
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,060
You have to go talk to him.

501
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,480
You just told me
the exact opposite.

502
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,020
Reverse psychology.
It didn't work.

503
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,350
How's this?

504
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,060
What I'm going to do for you,
Michael,

505
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:07,820
is, I am going to go there
with you for moral support

506
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,570
and I will act as your assistant

507
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:12,610
and maybe I'll do
my famous gay character.

508
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,490
I don't think you've seen
that character.

509
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,290
I think I have.

510
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:20,000
Mm... I don't think so.

511
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,960
<i>The next day Michael sat down</i>

512
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,670
<i>for a one-on-one meeting</i>
<i>with Ron Howard</i>

513
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:28,130
<i>- at Imagine.</i>
- Hi, thank you for seeing me.

514
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:29,880
Oh, well, that's fine, but

515
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,180
I should warn you, this is what
I call a haircut meeting, so

516
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,260
- we probably don't have
much time. -Okay.

517
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,970
It would be so much better
if we could just lose

518
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,640
- the baseball cap.
- We go through this every time.

519
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,350
This is a hat-on haircut,

520
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:42,230
so you just cut
what they can see.

521
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,400
You got it, Floyd?

522
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,400
I call all my barbers Floyd.

523
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,690
I'm gonna make this quick.

524
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,150
Are you not going
to introduce me?

525
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,160
Thought you were going
to wait in the lobby.

526
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,410
Tobias Funke.

527
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:55,530
I am a producer as well.

528
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:58,040
- Hey.
- But I'm also an actor.

529
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,370
That's probably
what confused you.

530
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:01,370
Um, I've done
several inmate roles

531
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,670
as well as a couple
of "And as it is such,

532
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:05,920
so also as such is it
unto you"s,

533
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,210
but I'll get to you after.

534
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,920
Well, that's terrific.

535
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,970
- Do you notice that he's already
on my neck hair? -Yes.

536
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,760
Last time I was in here,
we talked about,

537
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,680
I wouldn't come back until I had
all the release signatures.

538
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,510
- I wanted to give you
an update on that. -Terrific.

539
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,560
You can just leave 'em
on Louisa's desk.

540
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,600
What-- but that, uh,
that's the update.

541
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,560
I don't have them.

542
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,350
Done.

543
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,860
Okay, well, thanks for coming.

544
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,610
Well, um...

545
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:30,530
- Don't you have something else
you wanted to say? -Yeah.

546
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:32,360
If not, I'll do mine.

547
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,570
No, no, no.
What? I don't...

548
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:36,280
Ron,

549
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,950
I care about someone deeply
and I think

550
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:41,160
that you may also care
about this person.

551
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,000
Hey, that's terrific.

552
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,420
It's Rebel-- Rebel Alley,

553
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:49,170
and she thinks that you're going
to always be in her life.

554
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:51,380
I'm glad to know
she thinks that.

555
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,510
- Yeah. -Tell him
how you feel about her.

556
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:55,340
Yeah, I-- you know,
I'm crazy about her,

557
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,840
and, and I just-- I'm not going
to be able to do anything

558
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:01,470
about that until you let her go.

559
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,060
- She's my little num-num.
- Sure.

560
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,440
- You understand what I'm saying?
- Of course.

561
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,350
I-I've changed her,
I've bathed her.

562
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,610
Well, now you want to bathe her.

563
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,900
Yeah, it's, it's my time
to bathe her.

564
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,280
She should be your num-num.

565
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,070
She should be my num-num,
and you've got

566
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:18,240
to just let her go, I think,
once and for all.

567
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,120
You know, a father doesn't
really like to hear that

568
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,620
when it comes to his daughter.

569
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,700
I haven't had a chance
to talk to her father.

570
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,370
Yeah, I have,
I have not yet had a chance

571
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,920
to talk to her father, but...

572
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,790
No, no, I was,
I was saying that.

573
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,960
Because you are talking
to her father.

574
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:49,730
Did you not know
that I'm Rebel's dad?

575
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:52,770
I knew that part.

576
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,360
But I, I also--

577
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:02,830
I thought that, that, that,
that you might also be...

578
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:05,000
her...

579
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:09,380
Her lover?

580
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,210
- No.
- Well,

581
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,630
this is hardly an episode
of<i>Happy Days.</i>

582
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:14,920
I get it.

583
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,840
I was arrested
as a sex offender,

584
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,840
but at least I knew
it was my daughter

585
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,430
I was arrested for coming on
to. -

586
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:23,640
Now, about my project,
it's a family piece.

587
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,560
Does this mean
our project is dead?

588
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,310
Listen, I never let personal
matters interfere with business.

589
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:32,310
However, you should know
she's dating someone else, and

590
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,820
I'll do everything in my power
to make sure

591
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,360
she never dates you again.

592
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,440
Incredibly fair of you.

593
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:40,160
Well, that was
a merry mix-up, eh?

594
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,120
Now, about my project--

595
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,370
it's based on something
that you produced in '92--

596
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:46,250
<i>The Fantastic Four.</i>

597
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:48,540
- Well, that was a favor that I
did for Fox. -Well, it turns out

598
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:52,420
that one of the leads, DeBrie,
played Sue Storm.

599
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,170
In fact, she is the leading lady

600
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:58,420
in my production
<i>- The Musical,</i>

601
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:01,180
which, with a wave
of your little pink hand,

602
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,720
you could make happen,

603
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,260
and then I'd owe you one.

604
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,270
Well, uh, thanks,
but, uh, I couldn't do that.

605
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:09,560
It, it would just be
so incredibly meaningful

606
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,690
an-an-and change so many lives.

607
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:13,900
I can't do it, but...

608
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:16,940
...I also don't want to.

609
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,740
You are ruining my life,
Ron Howard!

610
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:25,910
No, no, no, no, no, no.

611
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,660
- No, no, no, no...
- You're ruining... -Aah, Louisa!

612
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:33,330
I'm gonna start wearing a hat
when I get my hair cut, too.

613
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,880
What is wrong with you?

614
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:38,460
You knew that Ron Howard was
Rebel Alley's father?

615
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:40,300
Yes, everyone does.

616
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,300
I didn't realize that's who
you thought the other man was,

617
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:44,550
but the good news is,
at least one of our projects

618
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,010
is still going, which, by the
way, I haven't signed this yet.

619
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,220
Should I?

620
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:52,650
Yes, absolutely, thank you.

621
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:55,770
Okay, my movie rights.

622
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:59,900

00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,460
is okay with all of this?

684
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,080
Hmm, I'm sure they think of this
as an homage.

685
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,000
Yes. Okay, well, I'm going to go
put on my rock monster outfit

686
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,550
and pass out some fliers.

687
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:25,050
You can take any boat
to the float.

688
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:26,670
Oh, Tobias.

689
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,880
I don't think I can do this.

690
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,720
You can do anything
I want you to do.

691
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,930
And-and you want to do as well.

692
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:34,720
We need this.

693
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:36,730
This will make
all our old dreams come true.

694
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:38,850
But maybe they're old
for a reason.

695
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:41,810
Oh, you're focusing
on the wrong words.

696
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,650
If we can get through tonight,
DeBrie,

697
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:45,110
we can get through anything.

698
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:46,440
Don't worry about it.

699
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:48,280
The audience will be
completely drunk,

700
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,200
and if we're not perfect,
they'll take it out on us,

701
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,530
but... that's why you're going
to be perfect.

702
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:54,080
You have to be perfect.

703
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,620
- : Okay.
- : Okay.

704
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,450
- All right.
<i>- But Tobias was about</i>

705
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,420
<i>to discover a situation</i>
<i>that was less than perfect.</i>

706
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:02,840
- What?! Oh, no.
- Fantastic Four!

707
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,880
Who would bring kids here?
This is no place for...

708
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,920
I'm a registered sex offender.

709
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,130
All right.

710
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:09,380
I'm a registered...

711
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,590
I'm a registered sex offender.

712
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,340
I'm a registered
sex offender.

713
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:14,720
<i>Tobias knew that wearing</i>
<i>the Thing outfit</i>

714
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,020
<i>would only make him</i>
<i>more recognizable,</i>

715
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:19,390
<i>- so he was at a loss.</i>
- Fantastic Four!

716
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:22,190
<i>- DeBrie was also at a loss.</i>
- Okay, okay.

717
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:23,980
<i>Feeling frightened and fragile,</i>

718
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:27,320
<i>she tried to keep it together</i>
<i>in a very slippery place.</i>

719
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,190
<i>And she probably would have</i>
<i>made it,</i>

720
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,360
<i>if the calming waves</i>
<i>she was looking at</i>

721
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:34,320
<i>weren't down current</i>
<i>from where Dr. Norman</i>

722
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:36,370
<i>was flushing away the remains</i>
<i>of his medical career.</i>

723
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:40,410
<i>And so DeBrie, who had been</i>
<i>in the safe harbor</i>

724
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,290
<i>of a drug-free zone,</i>
<i>found herself</i>

725
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:45,250
<i>in the free drug zone</i>
<i>of an unsafe harbor.</i>

726
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:49,090
<i>And that's when fate dealt</i>
<i>Tobias a new hand.</i>

727
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:50,880
Buster. Oh, thank God.
I need your help.

728
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,430
I've got a show to do
in ten minutes and I haven't got

729
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:55,180
a thing to wear...
this Thing suit.

730
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,930
<i>And that's how Buster</i>
<i>was drafted</i>

731
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:59,770
<i>to be in Tobias' musical.</i>

732
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:01,810
You're a monster,
you don't have to be good.

733
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:04,270
- What?<i>-It wasn't a great</i>
<i>choice of words.</i>

734
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:06,900
Butch it up
and sing your heart out.

735
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,690
<i>- Having recast the Thing,</i>
- DeBrie! DeBrie?

736
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,530
<i>Tobias returned to check</i>
<i>on his leading lady.</i>

737
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:12,450
: No, I'm looking
for a woman named DeBrie.

738
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:14,870
DeBrie!

739
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:16,120
Fantastic Four!

740
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,580
Have you been drinking?

741
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:21,290
No... it's pills.

742
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:23,580
How could you do this to me?

743
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:27,000
Or did I do this to you?

744
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,420
You to me.

745
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:31,170
I should have left you happy
and healthy and sober

746
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,970
in that rehab instead of trying
to rekindle the career

747
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:35,970
that brought you there
in the first place.

748
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:38,180
Is she drunk?

749
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,640
Uh, no.

750
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,480
- It's pills.
- Eh.

751
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,980
Can I talk to you for a second?

752
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,560
Yes. Uh, yes. Yes.

753
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:48,520
That is unacceptable.

754
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:51,690
Patients doing pills
on a literal pile of garbage,

755
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,570
that's not what we're about
at Austerity.

756
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:55,910
Where's Argyle?
It's his...

757
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:57,660
I can't let you blame Argyle
for this.

758
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,910
It would destroy his confidence
and he's a little shaky

759
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:02,250
on the lyrics as it is.

760
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:03,910
He's not very good.

761
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,250
Fine, then I blame you.

762
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:06,960
Someone has to pay for this.

763
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,500
You're putting Austerity
in jeopardy.

764
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,750
You're out!

765
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,170
No, don't fire me. I'm on
a work-release program.

766
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,470
If you fire me, then I have
to go back to prison.

767
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:15,760
I can't go to prison.

768
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,220
And you're investing
in this show.

769
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,890
What if we get killer notices?

770
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:21,680
We'll talk about it on Monday.

771
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,270
Now, get rid of her

772
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:26,020
before someone sees her
with their camera phone.

773
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:28,020
You know they have those
nowadays.

774
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:34,320
So I've got until Monday
to fix this.

775
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:47,620
That red-haired lady can't throw
her wad at that guy.

776
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:49,330
Oh, DeBrie.

777
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,920
<i>But on the other side</i>
<i>of the Dumpster,</i>

778
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,590
<i>things hadn't been</i>
<i>so laughable.</i>

779
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:55,720
Hi, honey.
Are you in the play?

780
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,220
- Yeah.
- What is the play, honey?

781
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,970
<i>Fantastic Three</i>

782
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:00,600
<i>and Lousy One,</i>

783
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,640
so<i>Four.</i>

784
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,810
- Four?
- Yeah.

785
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:03,890
And who do you play?

786
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:05,140
Sue Storm.

787
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,940
Okay, Sue Storm
and the Fantastic Four

788
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:09,810
are both trademarked by the
Marvel Entertainment LLC.

789
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,610
This is a cease and desist
letter.

790
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:14,440
If you violate it, you will go
to prison for a long, long time.

791
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,200
And you certainly can't wear
a four in a logo.

792
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,610
<i>In fact, it wasn't even Marvel</i>

793
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,530
<i>that owned the four</i>
<i>in a circle.</i>

794
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:22,780
<i>It was trademarked</i>
<i>by the Four Feinbergs.</i>

795
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:25,160
Hey, can anyone just throw
one of these little Mexico

796
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,250
- guitars off the dock?
- I don't want to go to prison.

797
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:29,460
I'm going to do it.

798
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:34,880
Well, Lucille 2 has threatened
me with prison,

799
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,340
but it's going to take more than
one prison threat...

800
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,840
Oh, you got one, too.

801
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:41,470
Well, universe,
you seem to be putting up

802
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:43,390
all sorts of walls between me
and my dreams.

803
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:44,930
Today.

804
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:47,770
Well, if we have any chance
of beating this,

805
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:50,060
it's by putting on
the best show possible.

806
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,270
A real wowzer.

807
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:54,570
I just need to find a Sue Storm.

808
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:57,780
I guess I'll need this.

809
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:00,530
Before I go any further
with this,

810
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:02,950
there's no way a hot cup
of coffee and a

811
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:05,280
glass of "the show must
go on" spirit

812
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:08,000
will encourage you in any way,
will it?

813
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,000
Let me die.

814
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:16,300
No, you're not in any shape
to go out and perform tonight.

815
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:19,510
<i>Tobias knew he couldn't leave</i>
<i>DeBrie in the trash</i>

816
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:21,220
<i>in a highly trafficked area,</i>

817
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:23,890
<i>but also knew he had a show</i>
<i>to put on.</i>

818
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:27,600
<i>And so he went off to search</i>
<i>for any Sue Storm in the port.</i>

819
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:31,140
<i>And when the search proved</i>
<i>unsuccessful,</i>

820
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:34,230
<i>he ended up finding one</i>
<i>inside himself.</i>

821
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:37,230
Time to channel
my inner Storm.

822
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,690
<i>And because he didn't have</i>
<i>the costume,</i>

823
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,650
<i>he created one</i>
<i>out of some makeup</i>

824
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,410
<i>he'd always had</i>
<i>in case he got a call.</i>

825
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:47,240
<i>And perhaps it was his muscle</i>
<i>memory that led to this.</i>

826
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:51,620
Tobias, what are you doing?

827
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:54,040
Oh. Pardon the mess.

828
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,840
I just blue myself for the first
time in five years.

829
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,590
: Excuse me.
Make way for Sue Storm.

830
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:03,340
<i>And now the almost invisible</i>
<i>Invisible Girl,</i>

831
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:06,470
<i>got on the boat to head</i>
<i>to the floating stage.</i>

832
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:08,930
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>and not for the first time,</i>

833
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:12,060
<i>Tobias got on the wrong boat.</i>

834
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:15,110
<i>Except this one</i>
<i>was piloted by a man</i>

835
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:18,110
<i>who not only expected a woman</i>
<i>in disguise,</i>

836
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:21,610
<i>but also had a real bad case</i>
<i>of face blindness.</i>

837
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:24,860
<i>And as it turned out,</i>
<i>the woman he was expecting</i>

838
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:26,740
<i>had just given a rousing speech</i>

839
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:30,200
<i>and joined the Love campaign</i>
<i>as they took the message</i>

840
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,330
<i>that Marky had vowed</i>
<i>to torpedo to the sea.</i>

841
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:36,960
I think this is going
to make quite a splash.

842
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:41,300
