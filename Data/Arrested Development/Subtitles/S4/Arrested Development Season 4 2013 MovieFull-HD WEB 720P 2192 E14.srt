1
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,450
It was Tres de Cinco,

2
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,850
or the day before Cinco de Cuatro,

3
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:14,950
and Buster Bluth had finally
found a family he fit in with.
or the day before Cinco de Cuatro,

4
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:19,230
and Buster Bluth had finally
found a family he fit in with.

5
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,360
Where's Mother? Ah.

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,740
Ah, way to go, way to go.

7
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,360
Hi. I know you've been down today,

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,240
so I brought you this.

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,860
They're for Cinco.

10
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:32,320
In case you wanted to make confetti

11
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:33,820
out of something other than the pictures

12
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,950
that they sell of the
chubby Linda Ronstadt.

13
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:38,290
I am so blessed to have you in my life.

14
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:41,210
I'm so blessed to have you in my life.

15
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,040
Just six weeks ago, I was a hot mess.

16
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,630
I was desperate for a mother,

17
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:48,380
and I don't think I could admit it.

18
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,130
As you'll see, he admits it plenty.

19
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,930
But now look at me.

20
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:56,060
I'm with a beautiful, elegant woman!

21
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:02,900
And I think we should
take it to the next level.

22
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,780
Buster had come a long way
since his fear of boats...

23
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:12,980
- ... was conquered...
- Baby.

24
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:16,110
And then rekindled, only to find himself

25
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,160
- facing a bigger fear.
- Oh, come on!

26
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,990
But his biggest fear wasn't confronting

27
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,410
a wet, loose seal; it was losing one.

28
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:25,790
Wait! She doesn't have her makeup!

29
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,370
I have her lipstick!

30
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,420
Mother!

31
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,090
- Michael.
- Yeah, it's a tough one

32
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:33,500
because there's about 400
witnesses that are ready

33
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:35,090
to throw her underneath the boat.

34
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:37,090
I don't think I can even help.

35
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,300
Buster was distraught,

36
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:43,180
- and made some foolish mistakes.
- Hey, Lupe.

37
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,560
- Oh, Buster.
- Like this.

38
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,850
Are you going to be all right?

39
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,190
- Oh.
- Uh, you want me to stay?

40
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:48,900
I was planning to visit with my family.

41
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,190
Oh, no, and just watch.

42
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:51,520
Mother is going to come

43
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,480
waltzing through that door any day now,

44
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,980
and she is going to be screaming,

45
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:57,990
"Make sure you frisk that girl before... "

46
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,450
I'll be fine.

47
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:03,870
- That's my perfume.
- Mm, good.

48
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:06,000
Okay, good. She wouldn't wear that.

49
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,080
When his father didn't return, either,

50
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,790
Buster stuck to his daily routine.

51
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,710
Ah.

52
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:12,840
You're welcome.

53
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,300
Laying out Mother's clothes...

54
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,960
All right.

55
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,050
♪ The vodka goes in, you
pour it in the other ♪

56
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,630
Making Mother's breakfast...

57
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,300
♪ The olive on top and

58
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,890
♪ Mother. ♪

59
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:30,310
Oh, this is bugging me.

60
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,770
And amusing himself with little jokes...

61
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,110
Ah, finito.

62
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,610
He thought she'd appreciate.

63
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,030
Except for the hair.

64
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:41,110
You have reduced.

65
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,950
Well, you're not that skinny.

66
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,660
Welcome home, chubs.

67
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,410
Oh, you will kill me for that.

68
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,670
And I don't want that blood on my hands.

69
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,590
And with his mother gone, it was nice

70
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,750
to get a chance to use the sewing machine.

71
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:01,550
Still, he found ways to
feel good about himself.

72
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,760
Buster, you always come through.

73
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,760
Oh, Mother, that's so nice.

74
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,980
No, no, no, no, no, I
mean it. It's amazing work.

75
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,560
- But he knew it wasn't real.
- Okay, I need to stop,

76
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,980
or I'm going to be committed.

77
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,480
At first.

78
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,020
What?

79
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,190
But that would take hours.

80
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,650
Oh, this is going to be just stunning.

81
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,200
You are always so right.

82
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,620
And then the waiter came back,

83
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,740
and he said, "Oh, I'm sorry. Who are you?"

84
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,750
And I said, "I'm Buster Bluth.

85
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:33,210
That's the fourth time I've told you."

86
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,210
Soon, he had run out of food...

87
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,300
that he knew how to make.

88
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,340
But everywhere he looked, he found

89
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,010
mocking reminders of the woman he lost.

90
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,100
He did find some supplies

91
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:50,560
from one of his mother's "I
can quit any time" stints.

92
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,140
Oh, cute.

93
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,270
But the emotional lift was temporary.

94
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:58,440
And before long, things had gotten weird.

95
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,900
♪ Put the olive on top and
you set it down for Mother. ♪

96
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,360
To an uninformed observer,
it looked a little

97
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,070
like that Vince Vaughn movie Psycho.

98
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,780
Oh, I agree.

99
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:11,450
Dancing with the Stars has
gone completely downhill.

100
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,500
This pasta's way overcooked, Buster!

101
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,630
Well, you didn't leave me
the simplest recipe, Mother.

102
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:22,510
Finally, Lucille was
released under house arrest,

103
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:25,840
and everything returned to normal.

104
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,350
Oh.

105
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:30,060
I was just thinking about you.

106
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,770
Now the story of a family

107
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,140
whose future was abruptly cancelled

108
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,480
and the one son who had no choice

109
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,730
but to keep himself together.

110
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,950
It's Buster's...

111
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:50,450
Buster was passing time with Lucille...

112
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,990
Chinchilla!

113
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,540
By playing games like Guess the Fur.

114
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,580
The one you got after Dad had the affair

115
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,250
with the chubby intern from Riverside.

116
00:04:58,290 --> 00:04:59,670
You win again, Buster.

117
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,460
I know what's going to stump you.

118
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,880
Oh!

119
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,670
Close your eyes tight and plug your ears.

120
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,680
Just plug one ear and press
the other one to the couch.

121
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,680
But after three months of being

122
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,350
cooped up with her youngest son...

123
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,850
Mother! Stop! Mother!

124
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:17,150
Lucille was growing restive.

125
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:19,360
No, Mother! If the alarm goes off

126
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,730
and they catch you, they'll
take you away forever!

127
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:24,780
I can't take it anymore.
I have to get out of here.

128
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,900
I don't care. I can't keep playing

129
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,910
Guess My Fur six times a day.

130
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,080
I need a smoke.

131
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:35,370
Right to the smokes, huh?

132
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,830
Give me a minute. Let me catch my breath.

133
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,710
And Buster refined a testimony

134
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,300
that was meant to spare Lucille from jail

135
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,050
at a legal defense strategy meeting

136
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,420
- slash graduation party.
- It's gonna be an eel!

137
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,840
Congratulations, Mother.

138
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,720
You've managed to combine people's fear

139
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,800
of homosexuals and eels into one alibi.

140
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,510
And he'll be wearing his Army uniform

141
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,560
so I can pretend I'm proud of him again.

142
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,600
I couldn't find my Army uniform.

143
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,730
Oh, but I thought the jury might like it

144
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:01,440
if I show up as John-John Kennedy.

145
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,360
Oh, yeah, that went over great last time.

146
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,530
And it was offensive.

147
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:09,610
Half your testicle was
hanging out of that thing.

148
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,990
Good!

149
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,240
I'm glad they saw it.

150
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,120
It was like a Motherboy Ball, right?

151
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,370
Hmm?

152
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,830
- Hi.
- Hi.

153
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,920
Put on your new uniform... with long pants.

154
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,090
And keep your ball joke to
yourself, Andrew Dice Clay.

155
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:27,010
So you can see why I need

156
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,720
the testimony of someone
who's not a hot mess.

157
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,550
- You're a hot mess!
- You're a hot mess!

158
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,680
Let me get this
straight... you won't let me

159
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,260
help with your case...

160
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,100
And the night before the trial,

161
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,810
tensions had only gotten worse.

162
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:41,600
You need me just as much
as I need you, cookie.

163
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,400
Oh, really?

164
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,530
Because you can be replaced, you know.

165
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:47,110
Can she?

166
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:51,450
And even if you can't,
you're not the boss of me.

167
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,990
Can I go to... ? I'm going to the park!

168
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,660
Oh, Buster.

169
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,750
Hello.

170
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,580
Hello to you, too, 2.

171
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,750
Oh, look at all this produce.

172
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,960
I'm juicing now. Would you like to join me?

173
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,380
It's 2:00 o'clock in the afternoon.

174
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,920
Fine it's 8:00 a.m. somewhere.

175
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,380
Oh, I forgot...

176
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,800
your mother wouldn't allow it.

177
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,850
I don't care what she wants.

178
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:18,470
Don't care what she wants.

179
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,230
I don't do everything she tells me.

180
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,810
Let's get juiced.

181
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,440
The next morning, Buster awoke

182
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,940
- with a vicious juice hangover.
- Oh.

183
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,070
Well, that was a freebie.

184
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:36,030
Mother's trial.

185
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,620
Key witness!

186
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,330
Key witness coming through.

187
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,870
I'm a key... I...

188
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,670
I was making two ban...

189
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,420
Late last night, it was drizzling rain!

190
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,380
I'm a key witness.

191
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,220
Is it over?

192
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,390
No, no, the grab-a-crab fest just started.

193
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,770
Grab-a-crab?

194
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:02,350
Oh, ma'am, um... is... is there a verdict

195
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,190
in the "my mother stole
theQueen Mary"thing?

196
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,810
It's all up on the dailies board.

197
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:08,320
Dailies? What? Clam ch...

198
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,730
The fish is frozen here!

199
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:14,660
It's frozen! Do you really want
to spend $30 on frozen fish?

200
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,070
Buster.

201
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,620
Where were you? This is all your fault.

202
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,910
No, I was making... was making a ban...

203
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,370
- I was making two ban...
- Save it.

204
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:23,160
I can smell the cran-apple
on you from here.

205
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:25,170
When... when are you coming home?

206
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:26,790
I'm serving three to five.

207
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,670
Like the saltless pie?

208
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:31,630
I hope your juicy blender
bender was worth it.

209
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:34,300
Don't come to visit me
because I won't see you.

210
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,090
Oh, and good luck with your night terrors.

211
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,970
Now no one will be there
to hear your screams.

212
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,350
Won't miss it!

213
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,810
Where... where do I go?

214
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,230
What do I do?

215
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:50,690
Where... where'd you get the pirate hat?

216
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,490
Where... where do I go?

217
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,530
And so Buster went back to the penthouse,

218
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:57,530
feeling guilty and alone.

219
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,200
And he couldn't bear to
relive the time he was there

220
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,660
without Lucille before.

221
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,410
I can't go through
another two days like that.

222
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,420
And that's how Buster
decided to make another go

223
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,920
at making another go at Lucille 2.

224
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,340
Buster.

225
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,800
My mother's gone away,

226
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,630
and I thought, you've always been like a...

227
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,680
- Girlfriend.
- Not what I was gonna say.

228
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,010
Anyways, I was over there,
and my friend's over here,

229
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:20,260
and I thought, maybe I should just move in,

230
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,970
because I love to hear
all about your medications

231
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,520
and ailments and whatnot.

232
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,560
Is that baby toe of yours still crawling

233
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,440
over the others like a weird weed?

234
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,690
Oh, Buster, how sweet of you to remember.

235
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,150
Oh, it's one of my night terrors.

236
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:33,530
But listen, Buster,

237
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:36,240
- before I invite you into my arms...
- Mm-hmm.

238
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,280
My bedroom, my bathtub with the railing...

239
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,200
- Mm-hmm.
- I have to ask you something.

240
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,410
Mm-hmm.

241
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,000
Are you sure you're ready for this?

242
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,580
So, that pretend kid's bedroom,
is that not an option... ?

243
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,000
No, that room is all storage now, honey.

244
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,920
So, yes or no?

245
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,550
Are you ready to let go of your mother?

246
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:57,970
Buster thought he was,

247
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:00,550
although there was one ominous sign.

248
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,930
I am ready for that, Lucille.

249
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,480
Did you hear it?

250
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:12,310
Wait. Did you just drop
the 2 after my name?

251
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,360
Oh, I hope not.

252
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,900
That would be creepy.

253
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,900
Before you accidentally skip back too far

254
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:21,700
and wind up in the middle
of the Maeby episode,

255
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,240
trust me, no "2" was spoken.

256
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,500
Every day, Buster visited the prison

257
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,040
where his mother was incarcerated.

258
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,420
Buster Bluth and pie for his m...

259
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,420
Lucille Bluth.

260
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,010
Hmm...

261
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,590
And every day, she refused to see him.

262
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,840
No.

263
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:43,100
Oh.

264
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,390
She doesn't want to see you.

265
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:46,520
Excellent.

266
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,480
He even pretended to be

267
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,690
an old college flame of
Lucille's to gain admittance.

268
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:57,900
Hello.

269
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,620
Alex Trebek?

270
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,030
She then rephrased it in
the form of a question.

271
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,990
Who is Alex Trebek?

272
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,870
Buster.

273
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:14,340
- No, Buster.
- Mm-hmm.

274
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,300
Do you have a pie or a
small sponge cake available?

275
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,390
- Ah. Thank you.
- Here you go.

276
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:25,760
And while his days were spent trying to get

277
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,560
- his mother to love him...
- Oh, Buster!

278
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,430
- You're just in time.
- ... his nights were consumed

279
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,980
with getting his lover to mother him.

280
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,690
I hope you are in the
mood for a hot tomato.

281
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:35,190
Mmm. Soup?

282
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:37,320
With little grilled cheese
sandwiches on the side.

283
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,690
Buster, that was innuendo.

284
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,200
- Oh.
- My Lord, it's like

285
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,070
we're speaking different languages here.

286
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,490
No, it's not.

287
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:45,830
It is working.

288
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,950
I'm getting hungry.

289
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,120
For love?

290
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,580
Oh, God, is this another

291
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:54,330
one of those nights where
nothing is as it seems

292
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,590
and there's no cream pie for dessert?

293
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,630
Holy Toledo, Buster, sometimes I think

294
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:01,380
I'm nothing but a Horn & Hardart to you.

295
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,180
Oh! What happened to innuendo?

296
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,930
Let's do it quick.

297
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:07,050
It's an old restaurant.

298
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,850
Oh! A restaurant!

299
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:10,310
I don't care if it's old!

300
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,600
Look who I'm dating!

301
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,390
Let's go there. Let's go there now.

302
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,610
Buster, you can either
be a son or a lover...

303
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:20,280
and right now, you're
no good to me as a lover.

304
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,490
Maybe you're right.

305
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:26,030
Maybe this has been wrong from the start.

306
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:28,240
- So... Mom.
- Out.

307
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,870
And since he couldn't bear

308
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,330
- to go back to the penthouse...
- Out!

309
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:32,580
You know, if tomorrow, you don't open up

310
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,000
and let someone else in...

311
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,580
Buster needed to raise some money.

312
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,710
Then the treasures you have inside...

313
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,670
This is my Motherboy Four medal.

314
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:42,090
That's when I was a kangaroo in her pouch.

315
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:44,090
What'll you give me for it?

316
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:48,600
But Buster wasn't the first
Motherboy to hit hard times.

317
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,600
What will you give me for these?

318
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,180
All-time low.

319
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,480
And that's when Buster found inspiration.

320
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,440
She certainly looks proud of her son.

321
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,320
I'm back!

322
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,360
As it turned out, Buster
returned on the very day

323
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,820
the Army policy regarding
sexual orientation had changed.

324
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,950
- Are you gay?
- No.

325
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,120
- You can tell me.
- I'm not.

326
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,290
It's okay.

327
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,160
Drew, tell him.

328
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,870
- I'm gay.
- Oh.

329
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,080
- Peter's gay.
- Oh...

330
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,170
- Sergeant Melnick's gay.
- Oh.

331
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:19,290
Bi.

332
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:21,090
Oh, sorry, he's bi.

333
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,590
No, I'm going home for the day.

334
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:23,960
I'm gay.

335
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:25,420
Yeah, it really makes no difference to us.

336
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,800
- We'll find something for you.
- Perfect.

337
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,010
I was looking for something.

338
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,060
You said "something," right?

339
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,680
And that's how Buster officially

340
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,810
reenlisted in the Army.

341
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:39,270
And it's why, six months later,

342
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:40,310
- Lucille Bluth.
- Lucille Bluth

343
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,860
got some bad news.

344
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,190
Yes?

345
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:47,280
I'm here to see you about your son.

346
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,570
Oh, this is a ploy.

347
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:50,120
He's trying to get me to see him.

348
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,030
How do I know you're really in the Army?

349
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,750
Who did Larry Kert replace in Company?

350
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,120
I don't know.

351
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,920
I know who he thought he was replacing,

352
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,830
and it was Dean Jones.

353
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,250
But he didn't come close.

354
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,670
My Buster?

355
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,880
And Lucille rushed to the hospital.

356
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,010
What happened? Where's my son?

357
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:10,300
Mrs. Bluth, your son went
down while piloting a plane

358
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:13,180
- over Afghanistan.
- Oh, my God...

359
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,770
He deserves a big hand for
that and we gave him one.

360
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:18,690
I'm afraid, besides that,
there's nothing we can do.

361
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,690
Hi, Mother.

362
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,030
Well, you look fine.

363
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,360
The doctor said you went down

364
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,740
while piloting a plane over Afghanistan.

365
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,950
Oh, yeah, that plane was in Afghanistan.

366
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:35,080
It seems the Army had taken advantage

367
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,830
of Buster's childlike interest in games.

368
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:40,830
This is so much more
fun than "Guess the Fur."

369
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,130
And his childlike inability to distinguish

370
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:46,550
- between games and reality.
- Oh!

371
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:49,800
So they set him up as a drone pilot here.

372
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,430
Want to go to lunch, Private Bluth?

373
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:55,760
Not till I take out the hospital!

374
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:57,730
I tell you, this kid's amazing.

375
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:01,310
If I had him back in the '60s,
Cuba would be the 51st state.

376
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:04,520
You're not gonna get away
from me, little nurse! Aah!

377
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,650
He had been playing for 47 straight hours.

378
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:10,320
Take that, Taliban wedding!

379
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,450
But like anyone who plays
video games for too long,

380
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:15,030
he started to make mistakes.

381
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,870
Hey, Bluth, you just took
out an art museum in Madrid.

382
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,660
Oh, you can go to Spain in this thing?

383
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,040
Maybe you should take a break.

384
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,170
You could've hurt some innocent people.

385
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:23,250
Innocent people?!

386
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,960
You mean I've been

387
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,590
hurting guilty people?!

388
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:29,510
But Buster was a peaceful man.

389
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,880
Oh, God!

390
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,050
Pilot down!

391
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,760
Medic!

392
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,600
It was the kind of emergency

393
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,010
that the drone pilot paramedics
had long been waiting for.

394
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,390
I got a man down!

395
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:39,930
Sorry we're late.

396
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,640
Some kid swallowed an
eye at the Build-A-Bear.

397
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,020
Why do they have us at a mini-mall?

398
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,270
It was the first

399
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,520
known injury to a drone pilot

400
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,280
and the Army took it seriously.

401
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,950
Apparently, no one told him
that they were real planes.

402
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:52,360
If this guy comes after us,

403
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,570
they could pull funding
for the whole program.

404
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,870
So, how do we buy off ol' One Arm?

405
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:59,200
First we gotta find something he needs.

406
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,500
Well, we do have the bionics program.

407
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,290
Ice cream.

408
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,670
Maybe we shouldn't be discussing this here.

409
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,960
Yeah, I think we're at those kids' table.

410
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,760
So you fell out of a chair,

411
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,010
and for this, the government
gives you applause?

412
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:15,470
No... a big hand.

413
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:18,970
I thought I recognized
that little son of a bitch.

414
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:21,060
This is why you can't keep a job

415
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,390
at one hospital!

416
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:25,940
Why does it have to be so big?

417
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,900
Well, they said the
miniaturization comes later.

418
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:32,280
I mean, you remember how big
your first cell phone was.

419
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,110
That was a phone.

420
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,660
This looks like you're pointing
to a place that buys your gold.

421
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,740
I haven't learned how to control it.

422
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,330
They're gonna work with me.

423
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:42,620
So you had me come out
here under false pretenses?

424
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,040
You wouldn't come here any other way!

425
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,670
You haven't seen me in a year.

426
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:49,340
It's why I went to Army... to win you back.

427
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,630
You have to forgive me!

428
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:54,130
It's not about forgiving
you. Although I don't.

429
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:56,090
You need to grow up, Buster,

430
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,760
because I can't take care of you anymore.

431
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,640
I need to "get away-get away."

432
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,930
You're hopelessly hopeless, Buster.

433
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,230
It's as if they wrote
that song for my own son.

434
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:09,270
- Hm?
- I'm glad you have a new hand.

435
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:11,480
But you need to find
someone else to hold it.

436
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,110
Tell the prison limo to come around!

437
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:17,320
Fine! I got my own family now... Army!

438
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,870
And they want me!

439
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,120
You guys want me, right?

440
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,740
Oh, yeah. They're not gonna invest

441
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,450
this kind of money without
wanting you for keeps.

442
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,620
Oh, good. Once you learn how to use

443
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,870
that thing, they're going to turn you

444
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,830
into a killing monster.

445
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,580
Monster... ?

446
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,130
This doesn't make me look sexy.

447
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:32,340
Throw it out.

448
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,460
Well, that explains the photo shoot.

449
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,010
And so Buster began a rehab program

450
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,590
he was terrified to succeed at.

451
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,180
Open the cabinet, please.

452
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:45,640
Mm... mm... mm... mm!

453
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,940
Oh...

454
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,350
Too hard.

455
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,900
Uh, I think that was too hard.

456
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,110
- Okay.
- Yeah.

457
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:53,860
Let's just grab that toothpaste.

458
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,320
Okay.

459
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,150
- Use your new hand.
- Okay.

460
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,860
Oh!

461
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,450
I got some on you.

462
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:02,620
Uh... yeah.

463
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:05,410
- You did get some on me.
- Yeah.

464
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,830
- Too hard?
- Buster seemed slow to master the challenges.

465
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:10,290
Yeah, that's... that's on her.

466
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:12,460
- He got a little...
- It was too hard.

467
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,050
I think it was, as well.

468
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:16,970
Let's go ahead and fast-forward
through the commercials.

469
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:18,470
Okay, that's too fa... okay, stop.

470
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,970
Well, there's Jon Cryer.

471
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:21,340
Stop! That's Jon Cryer!

472
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,100
Well, look at that...

473
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,970
we're back at the
Progressive Insurance lady.

474
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,440
I'm better off just
watching the commercials!

475
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,980
Don't say that.

476
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,060
But behind the two-way mirror,

477
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:34,360
hope wasn't in abundance.

478
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,070
Hope this guy likes the music
acts on Saturday Night Live

479
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:39,360
because he's gonna be
watching a lot of them.

480
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,780
- How many remotes do we have?
- That was the only one.

481
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,870
There's seven monitors
here... we have one remote.

482
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:45,450
Do we have anybody from Pinky Team?

483
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:47,250
Guys, he can't do this!

484
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:50,080
And around week five,
the Army finally realized

485
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,830
that Buster was in no hurry to leave.

486
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,920
Aah! I blew it again!

487
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,340
I'll never do it right!

488
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,800
I'm a monst...

489
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,470
Do you have any ice cream?

490
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,640
Maybe it would work with ice cream.

491
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,390
And now he wants ice cream.

492
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:06,470
He's using us.

493
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:08,810
Yeah, it might be time for the Q-test.

494
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:10,600
The Q-test?

495
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,900
Oh...

496
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,860
I'm sorry, we're running behind
with your testing, Buster.

497
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,610
We'll just be a few more minutes.

498
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,240
Okay.

499
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,070
Oh... well... !

500
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,120
And it was then that Gunner learned why

501
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,990
- it was called the Q-test.
- Oh.

502
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,870
Aren't you the "cu-test"?

503
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:34,040
Now, he can't see us at
all... that's correct?

504
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,000
I know!

505
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,710
Why wouldn't he be able to see us?

506
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:40,220
- You looking around?
- Because it's a mirror.

507
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,510
No, it's a window.

508
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,430
Oh, hi.

509
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:48,680
Okay, let's take it down.

510
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,270
I know, I know...

511
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,190
Send in the authority figure.

512
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,560
Hi.

513
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,780
How are you managing
with that hand, solider?

514
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:16,170
Buster was being discharged from the Army.

515
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:18,090
So, where am I supposed to go?

516
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:19,590
What am I supposed to do?

517
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:21,590
I... I have nowhere to live.

518
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:24,380
You should've thought about that
before you let that cat live.

519
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:26,390
- And that's when he met Ophelia Love...
- Oh, I'm sorry.

520
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,890
The devoted wife of the
candidate Herbert Love,

521
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,680
- who was on a tour...
- I have nowhere to go.

522
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,560
- Of the Veterans' Hospital.
- Excuse me.

523
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,270
You're a veteran and
you have nowhere to go?

524
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,690
Oh, it's not Army's fault.

525
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:37,480
I'm a monster.

526
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,270
And what makes you think you're a monster?

527
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,280
What do you see when you look at this?

528
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:45,160
I see a veteran whose
hand I'd like to shake.

529
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,160
Not that one.

530
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,530
I think you should meet my husband.

531
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,450
We may have something for you.

532
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:53,960
Perfect! Wait, you didn't
say "nothing," did you?

533
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
- Something.
- "Something." Got it.

534
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,590
Look how big his hand is.

535
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:00,250
But Herbert would be less enthusiastic.

536
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,880
And you want him to live with us?

537
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,050
Well, he's a vet, Herbert.

538
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:06,180
And you yourself said you need something

539
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,470
to compete with the woman
you're running against.

540
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:12,220
Lucille 2 had recently adopted
a Hispanic boy named Perfecto.

541
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,850
And since you're never around, I mean,

542
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:15,350
he could help me with the boys.

543
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:17,730
It's like that movie The Blind Side.

544
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:21,860
I suppose we could use
a Blind Side Monster.

545
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,360
Well, we shouldn't call him a monster.

546
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,320
That's why I love you, Ophelia.

547
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:31,290
You've got a heart as big as
that Blind Side Monster's hand.

548
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:34,160
Oh!

549
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,160
And so it was decided

550
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:38,290
Buster was to stay with the Love family.

551
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:41,340
He's fine. He's fine. He's fine.

552
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,170
- Welcome to the family.
- Oh!

553
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:45,260
He'd found a home at last.

554
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,130
- Oh!
- Oh! Uh-uh, uh-uh!

555
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:51,680
In the following weeks,
Buster came in handy

556
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:55,890
Helping the boys at school...

557
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:59,350
This table is for National
Honor Society members only.

558
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,560
Really.

559
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,690
Well, what about these two guys?

560
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:03,980
Were they invited?

561
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,280
Light drizzle...

562
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,950
and thunder.

563
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:10,120
- What?!
- See, light drizzle will just annoy you

564
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:14,240
but, you see, thunder... will "F" you up!

565
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:16,910
This got the attention of Perfecto Telles,

566
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,670
vice president of the
student anti-bullying squad.

567
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:23,340
Buster even received a
badge from an undercover cop

568
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,800
that was posing as a teacher.

569
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,550
You're never too old
to stand up to a bully.

570
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:30,390
Whether he's an attention
hog who looks just like you,

571
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:32,180
or whether he's half your size.

572
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:38,100
He used his finely-honed
skills as a doting son

573
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,480
to give the long-neglected Ophelia

574
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,270
some much-deserved attention.

575
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,860
Pour in the liquor...

576
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,480
Don't want the boys to see...

577
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,360
You throw in some cola...

578
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,570
Got a Coke and Hennessy!

579
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,820
Just for you, Mother Love.

580
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,410
- Buster...
- Mm...

581
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:55,990
You are the most considerate
man I've ever met.

582
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,040
Oh, stop! You're embarrassing me!

583
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,750
And sweet and...

584
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:02,830
No, I'm serious... stop, stop.

585
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,130
But your other hand is waving me on.

586
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:05,800
Oh, is that going again?

587
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,380
I think it's on demo.

588
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,470
Do you have a pencil or a paper clip?

589
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,890
And he helped Herbert
on the campaign trail.

590
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:14,140
Let me show you what a
government handout looks like.

591
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,550
Hold your government hand out.

592
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,180
Yeah! And let's give
freedom from government

593
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:21,020
a big thumbs-up!

594
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,560
Although the hadn't
achieved complete mastery.

595
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,820
- Come on, Buster, dance!
- I don't want to dance.

596
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,730
Come on, dance, Buster!

597
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,150
Buster was enjoying his new role

598
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:31,700
as a symbol of government waste.

599
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,570
It's like I said about contraception:

600
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:35,620
If you want me to pay for her diaphragm,

601
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:39,450
- I get to put my hand in her...
- Shoe!

602
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,080
Nice stop, Blind Side Monster.

603
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,380
Buster... Blind Side Buster.

604
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,960
And he was feeling more
confident every day.

605
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,260
Mm!

606
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,710
Okay...

607
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,180
Give him a big hand back!

608
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:55,220
Arguably, too confident.

609
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:58,220
Hey!

610
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,730
Okay, hey, hey... Oh-ho!

611
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:03,060
Hah! Hm!

612
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,560
Although, after this appearance,

613
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,860
he spent a lot less time with Herbert.

614
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:11,070
And a lot more time with Ophelia.

615
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:13,070
Which is what led to this.

616
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,790
That's funny, no smoke came out.

617
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,370
Smoke?

618
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:21,580
Wait, what just happened?

619
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,370
This.

620
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,590
Okay, okay, okay.

621
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:29,630
So you don't think that the next level

622
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:31,630
is adult adoption, do you?

623
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:34,090
Come on, Buster.

624
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:36,640
You've been flirting with me since day one.

625
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,640
What?

626
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,100
Bringing me these flowers,

627
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,680
offering to undress me.

628
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,140
What about the singing?

629
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:47,520
"Sealed with a kiss" through
the door while I bathed?

630
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,070
Right.

631
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,730
Mother stuff.

632
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,820
I mean, you're married.

633
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,240
What is this?

634
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:04,410
That is my husband, with a prostitute.

635
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:08,880
I've worn a captain's hat with
someone who had hair like that.

636
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,960
But I... I can't...

637
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,050
I mean, you're like a mother to me.

638
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:18,510
You can either be a son or a lover to me.

639
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:21,140
And I already have two sons.

640
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,600
And perhaps it was the fear
that she'd throw him out,

641
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,100
or he finally did grow up,

642
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:28,770
but that night, Buster acted like a man.

643
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:33,780
After spending the night with Ophelia Love,

644
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:35,360
Buster proudly went to visit his mother.

645
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,780
I came here to thank you.

646
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:41,580
You were trying to push
me out of the nest...

647
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,160
and you were right.

648
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,540
- Really?
- Yes.

649
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,830
I've grown.

650
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:47,960
And I'm in love.

651
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,670
Hamster or turtle?

652
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:51,090
No, Mother.

653
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:52,170
Hamsters are gross.

654
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:53,510
It's a female.

655
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,300
Human. Female human. Whole thing.

656
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:58,260
So your parental
responsibilities are complete.

657
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,340
Hot.

658
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:02,560
I no longer need you.

659
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,020
Well, you don't have to go that far.

660
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,850
I'm not a mother boy anymore.

661
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:09,690
I'm a mother man.

662
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,030
Use your good hand.

663
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:19,860
Guards!

664
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:23,830
And on his way back to his new love,

665
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:26,040
Buster ran into Michael,

666
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,870
who was trying to get the life story rights

667
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:30,580
from one of the few
remaining family members

668
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:33,040
he hadn't thrown out of the movie.

669
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:34,050
What about Mom?

670
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:35,460
I have her, but I'm about to

671
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,970
throw it in her face when I see her,

672
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:39,510
and I can't go to my son.

673
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:42,050
Well, I have nothing to be ashamed about.

674
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,560
I'm in love.

675
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,600
And do you want to hear
something so surprising?

676
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,140
She started out as my mother figure.

677
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:52,150
- Not surprising.
- And he returned back

678
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:55,480
to his love nest to tell
Ophelia the good news.

679
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,030
I'm out of the thing!

680
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:58,450
How did yours go?

681
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:00,570
It's over.

682
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:02,200
I talked to Herbert, I told
him everything about us,

683
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,200
and it's over.

684
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,740
Mm. I know it's scary.

685
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:08,460
I just got out of a long relationship, too.

686
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,710
But I'm here for you.

687
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:12,630
And, girl, I ain't going nowhere.

688
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:14,340
I need you to leave.

689
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,790
Mm, so let's get it o... !

690
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,130
Wait, what's happening?

691
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:18,880
He wants to try to change.

692
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,640
He wants a second chance,
and I want to give it to him.

693
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,840
What...

694
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:26,810
So you... you were just
using me to hurt him?

695
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:29,140
Yes.

696
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,390
Thank you.

697
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,400
But what... what about me?

698
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,310
What happens to me?

699
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:37,650
I... I certainly can't go
back to you as my mother.

700
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:40,490
After I've zipped down, you
can't expect me to zip up!

701
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:41,700
I know that.

702
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,200
But you have to leave.

703
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,620
Oh, no, I'm okay with the mothering.

704
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:47,410
I mean, he had you first, I'm here to stay.

705
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:49,200
It's just a little
mother/son bump in the road.

706
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:52,170
Mother, I ain't going nowhere.

707
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:55,380
Your hand is broken again.

708
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:58,920
No, it's just my heart.

709
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,720
Oh, it's my hand, too, actually.

710
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,800
I'm sorry, Buster.

711
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:03,970
Buster was blindsided.

712
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:05,890
Ophelia!

713
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:07,510
Tell me this.

714
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,970
Who is a better lover?

715
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,520
- He is.
- He is. Okay.

716
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,060
What about son?!

717
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,980
Buster was hurt.

718
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,320
And perhaps that's why he availed himself

719
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,110
to the photos of Herbert
and the prostitute.

720
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,780
And Buster, furious,

721
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:30,700
decided to expose Herbert himself.

722
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,420
But not before using the wrong hand

723
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,210
to punch a picture of Herbert.

724
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,710
Stupid Bust... !

725
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,550
Unfortunately, it was the night of Cinco,

726
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:44,680
and no one was home to find him.

727
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,430
Sad. Sad.

728
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:56,400
Buster came to and rushed
to Cinco to share the photos

729
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,480
with Herbert Love's political enemy,

730
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:02,490
when he ran into Tobias,
who enlisted Buster's help

731
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:06,700
for a musical that was becoming
less fantastic every minute.

732
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,990
But I've got to find Lucille 2,
I've got to give her pictures.

733
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:11,290
- I don't know the songs.
- It's prerecorded.

734
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:13,410
You're a monster, you
don't have to be any good.

735
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:15,790
- What?
- Now just go Thing your heart out

736
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:18,000
and don't be put off by
the freakishly large...

737
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,460
What... Oh, God!

738
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,840
Okay, well, well, good.

739
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,590
Then just the, uh, the one glove will do,

740
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:24,970
and, uh... perfecto!

741
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,720
As fate would have it,

742
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,600
Perfecto Telles was also
in need of a monster.

743
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,220
He's a bully. So I want
you to "bad cop" him

744
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,270
for me a little, okay?

745
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,600
Yeah, yeah.

746
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,980
And that's when he heard his name.

747
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,810
Perfecto!

748
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,110
And he's a real bully.

749
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:43,320
He's taking money from this
innocent young high school girl.

750
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,740
Ugh, I don't think I can help you.

751
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,570
Please. I don't want to be

752
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:48,450
- a monster anymore.
- Can't you just

753
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:51,330
show him a little thunder?
Just to scare him a bit?

754
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:54,250
And that's when Buster saw
the woman he'd come for.

755
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:55,790
I'm sorry.

756
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:58,170
I have to take care of something.

757
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:00,920
Lucille 2.

758
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,300
- I've been looking for you.
- Buster!

759
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,590
You look different;
something's happened to you.

760
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:05,670
Yes.

761
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,550
I've been with a black woman.

762
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:09,010
I was talking about your hand.

763
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:11,430
Oh. This huge thing? Yeah, it's new.

764
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:13,470
Of course, the week after
I got it, the six came out.

765
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:15,220
You can play a flute with that one.

766
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:16,480
It comes with a flute!

767
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,940
But I'm not here about that.

768
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,850
I'm here about this.

769
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,610
What is this?

770
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:25,190
Oh, just pictures of Herbert
Love with a lady of the night.

771
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:29,110
And he's gotten himself in some
pretty hot ham water this time.

772
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,780
I want you to humiliate
him and win the election.

773
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,620
That's my wig.

774
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:37,080
Buster, this is priceless;
why are you giving it to me?

775
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,580
Because I want to hurt him.

776
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,960
I've never known you
to want to hurt anybody.

777
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,840
Well, I hurt my mother, didn't I?

778
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,090
I missed her trial, and
she cut me out of her life.

779
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:47,720
- But I'm over that!
- Really?

780
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,260
Then you have me to thank for that.

781
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,600
- What do you mean?
- Oh, Buster,

782
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,640
you think missing her
trial was an accident?

783
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,600
Yes.

784
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,230
Buster, I helped you with that.

785
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:01,900
Although "helped" might not be

786
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,480
the best description of what she did.

787
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,610
In fact, she'd been laying in wait for him.

788
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:07,900
Oh, Buster!

789
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:10,030
Hello!

790
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:14,870
And once she'd gotten
Buster into the apartment,

791
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:17,000
she eschewed the all-natural
juice for the kind

792
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:20,000
with cartoon animals
and riddles on the box.

793
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:24,670
The type Buster had been
known to have a weakness for.

794
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:26,550
Thank you.

795
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:29,550
And soon, the partying was off the hook,

796
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,840
with Buster drinking right out of the box.

797
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:35,560
Oh, this is just like Mother's Day Eve!

798
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,730
Although, at one point,

799
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:41,100
he did have something close to an insight.

800
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,150
I mean, how do you miss a sign like that?

801
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,520
Oh.

802
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:49,110
I was tinkling!

803
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,570
You kept me from mother?

804
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:53,950
You sent her to prison?

805
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:55,490
And this whole time, I thought about

806
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:56,700
getting back together with you.

807
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,580
Well, you're a little late, honey.

808
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:01,460
I've been dating your father
for the past couple of weeks.

809
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,670
Buster was in a whirl.

810
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,340
Confused and betrayed, he
wanted to punch something.

811
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,010
Which is why he went here.

812
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:18,180
Hey! I need to punch something!

813
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:20,470
Even if it is a poor little donkey.

814
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,640
But it wasn't that kind of donkey punch.

815
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,650
Oh, I need some juice.

816
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:31,610
Perhaps uno mas, señor,
to feed to the fishes?

817
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,400
Gene Parmesan.

818
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:35,410
This is not my real job.

819
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:37,530
And that's when Buster heard his target.

820
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,870
I got to go up and give my speech.

821
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:41,960
You!

822
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,210
Oh, hey, it's the Blind Side Monster.

823
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:48,710
And so he blindsided him and became one.

824
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:51,300
And it was amidst

825
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,760
the rampaging of the blowback

826
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,050
that a juiced-up Buster
noticed something horrifying.

827
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,740
Oh, no.

828
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:16,570
I'm in the movie.

829
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:18,740
Oh, no.

830
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,040
Buster tries to cover his tracks.

831
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:26,960
Hey, nephew!

832
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,250
New hand.

833
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:29,880
It's cool. That's cool.

834
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:33,300
You know that super-duper
privacy software you have?

835
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,380
Does that work on security cameras?

836
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,340
Of course, yeah.

837
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,680
Works on everything.

838
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,760
May I borrow it?

839
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,810
One second.

840
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:44,100
Here you go, Uncle Buster. I put it on

841
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,850
a hard drive for you. Just
please be careful with it.

842
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,690
Of course, of course.

843
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:53,190
Have you got one with a case?

844
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:54,650
Hey, Carl.

845
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:55,860
Buster!

846
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,570
And Buster visits

847
00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:00,410
a Balboa Towers guard
he'd known for many years

848
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:02,040
for an impromptu lesson

849
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,410
on how their footage
is gathered and stored.

850
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:06,830
May I use your phone?

851
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:09,330
But when Carl steps away,

852
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,920
Buster goes into action

853
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,920
and attempts to Fakeblock the footage.

854
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,510
Oh.

855
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:18,680
Sounds like it's working.

856
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,110
Buster.

857
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:32,270
Hey, Carl.

858
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:34,110
- Everything okay?
- Mm-hmm.

859
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,280
Bye, Carl.

860
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,990
- Bye-bye, Buster.
- Okay.

861
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,620
What she did to this boy.
