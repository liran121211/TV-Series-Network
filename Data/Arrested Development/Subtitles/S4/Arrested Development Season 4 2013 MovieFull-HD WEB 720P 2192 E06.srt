1
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,980
George Sr. had come
to a political fund-raiser

2
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,770
to get support
for a wall project...

3
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:18,650
To separate
the U.S. and Mexico.

4
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,320
...that some
considered insensitive...

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,150
- Which was my idea!
- Was your idea.

6
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,990
- ...even though he himself...
- Oh. Tender.

7
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:26,990
was feeling more sensitive
by the day.

8
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,490
Curious feeling.

9
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,660
But he tried to muster
the old self-confidence

10
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,490
for his face time
with Herbert Love.

11
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,040
And I-I just think
there will be a lot of support

12
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,920
flowing in this relationship,
and your base...

13
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,710
You got a point
behind all those teeth of yours?

14
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,460
If you support the wall,

15
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,000
I'll give you
a piece of the action.

16
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:45,010
- Action? Action Jackson?
- Yeah.

17
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,180
- Yes, sir.
- What do I look like, Carl Weathers to you?

18
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,510
- Oh, no, no.
- Not at all.

19
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,550
- No.
- This, of course, is Herbert Love.

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,970
My name is Herbert Love,
and I want you

21
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,560
to say "high-low"
to my low-high plan.

22
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,350
A candidate
whose campaign slogan

23
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,690
was embraced by everyone
from the very wealthy...

24
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,270
And who doesn't want
a high income?

25
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:03,530
...to their bankers
and tax attorneys.

26
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,440
High-low, high-low,
it's off to work I go--for you.

27
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:07,570
My name is Herbert Love,

28
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,740
and I most definitely
approve this message.

29
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,910
Do I look like someone
who eats at CW Swappigans?

30
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,330
See, I stand for three things:

31
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,950
one, getting
Barack Hussein Obama

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,040
Wama Comma Mama on a Llama
out of office...

33
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,340
It's a crazy-town name.

34
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,050
Two, low taxes
for high income earners.

35
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,210
That's my low-high plan.

36
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,510
- I know it.
- And three,

37
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:29,340
getting a little something
in my slushie fund

38
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,930
so that I'm nice and loose

39
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:32,800
and can help make
numbers one and two happen.

40
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,600
I don't want to be the one to
say it, but I happen to be fond

41
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,680
of redheads and greenbacks.

42
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,270
- George Sr. had neither.
- Oh, I-I...

43
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:41,060
- How would you like both?
- Get it for me tonight,

44
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,480
and I'll make your wall thing

45
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,980
the third point
of my three-point plan.

46
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,730
All I got right now is:
"You want to reach

47
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,490
"your hand into my pocket
to pay for your birth control?

48
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:51,530
I get to put my hand
in your pocket to put it in."

49
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,580
But when unveiled it
in Garden Grove,

50
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,830
I had to duck a
woman's pump and a mini pizza.

51
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,660
Oops.

52
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,210
Coming up with money, however,

53
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,120
would be difficult
for George Sr.,

54
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,710
who hadn't been acting
like his old self--

55
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,090
something his twin brother
Oscar had done

56
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,510
- You know, the wall.
- much more successfully

57
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,010
earlier that day,
when, in retribution...

58
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,470
Have you baked your brain
in that pizza oven?

59
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:12,140
...to a brother
who lied to him...

60
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,390
So he only did buy that land
for personal gain.

61
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,260
Well... Oscar.

62
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,990
- Oscar.
- ...Oscar chose to lie

63
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,640
- with George's wife.
- Call me Father B.

64
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,610
And, although too explicit
for an American audience,

65
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:26,520
the lovemaking was intense
and beautiful

66
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,490
but for one small
misunderstanding

67
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,360
that occurred
during the afterglow.

68
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,200
No. I-I mean...

69
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,780
it's good to be out of that

70
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,490
sweaty old hot box
at the compound.

71
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,830
No, this was am...
this was amazing.

72
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,500
And Oscar finally got
more information

73
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,120
- Speaking of that...
- about his brother's plans.

74
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:46,040
...we may need to have
a president ready to go

75
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,050
if something should happen
to Lucille 2

76
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,800
while we're building the wall.

77
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,720
So we are building a wall.

78
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,260
Right where Oscar

79
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,550
thought he would be spending
the rest of his life.

80
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,560
Turn him around three times
and put him in Fullerton,

81
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,230
- he won't know the difference.
- Fullerton.

82
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:04,900
You know, I think we should
send our son down there.

83
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,940
Give him some training,
show that he has a job,

84
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,150
let him sweat a little.

85
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,280
Buster? No, no.

86
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,650
I won't... I won't hear of it.

87
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:12,900
It could kill him.

88
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:14,530
I meant Gob.

89
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,030
Oh. Oh, fine.

90
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,700
Yeah, send him down.
I love that.

91
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,410
Now the story of a family

92
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,000
whose future
was abruptly canceled

93
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,250
and the one father
who had no choice

94
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:27,540
but to keep himself together.

95
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:33,630
It's George Sr.'s...

96
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,600
Unaware that he was being
cuckolded by his brother,

97
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,020
George Sr. was struggling

98
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,430
to find money
to bribe Herbert Love.

99
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,810
Didn't someone die
in one of these things?

100
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,520
Oh, no, not in one of ours.

101
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,900
Although his pitch had lost
some of its luster.

102
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,860
And, you know, I mean, it's
better than dying in the snow.

103
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,570
I mean, not...
not-not that you'll die,

104
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,530
but if you had to choose,
uh, I mean...

105
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,490
- Brr, you know?
- Hmm.

106
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,240
Well, I'll think about it.

107
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,910
Would you like a mini-quiche?

108
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,580
Oh, I'm so sorry.

109
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,130
I thought you were a successful
Republican strategist.

110
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,290
- I'm so sorry.
- Why, 'cause I'm black?

111
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,920
Oh, no...

112
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,840
It was over.

113
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,090
But at least
he could go home...

114
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,470
Cindy's going to love these.

115
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,260
Excuse me, Red,
you're not the only one

116
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,640
- who likes coconut shrimp.
- ...with some coconut shrimp.

117
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,270
Well, I should have
known you'd be here,

118
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:26,060
supporting this right-wing,
dangerous crackpot.

119
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,400
Lindsay, I forgot--
you dyed your hair.

120
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,360
What are you doing here?

121
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,980
I'm supporting Love, as well.

122
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,690
We're both doing that.

123
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,030
Oh, honey, I-I've wanted
to contact you

124
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,910
every single day since last May.

125
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,950
I haven't seen you
since January.

126
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,460
Yeah, the first four months,
I was in denial. How are you?

127
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,790
Are... are you good?

128
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,580
Do you have any money?

129
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,250
Not really.

130
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,790
- Oh.
- Oh, except for

131
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,670
a $50, 000 check

132
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,550
your wife sent to my daughter
for plastic surgery.

133
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:59,050
What kind of a woman does that?

134
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,300
I thought there
was no money left.

135
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:02,600
Oh, no. Oh, no.

136
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,100
Oh, that's awful.

137
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,270
I mean, she's just precious
the way she is.

138
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,440
Does Maisie even know
about this?

139
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,690
No, thank God.

140
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,360
And her name is Maeby.

141
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,900
You don't think Maisie's cuter?

142
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,570
You know what I want to do?
I want to take this,

143
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,450
and I want to deposit it
in a trust fund

144
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:23,240
that she can't open
until she's 21.

145
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,200
- I guess I can't use it anyway.
- Are you kidding me?

146
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:29,870
You are the most beautiful
little girl I know.

147
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,130
And if you have any more work,

148
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,460
your cartilage
is going to collapse.

149
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,920
Let me see if I can...

150
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,710
- There you go.
- And that's when

151
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,170
George Sr. finally tipped
a black man.

152
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,300
- Got the check.
- ...okay?

153
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,300
Ooh! Hey, you got the check.

154
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,340
Third party.

155
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,050
Oh, man.

156
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:47,270
- I am going to put this on my wall.
- Oh...

157
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:50,100
George Sr.
left the hotelhoping he'd

158
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:54,150
accomplished something.

159
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:56,230
And on the news the next day...

160
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,780
We have got...

161
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:01,990
to build a wall
between us and Mexico.

162
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,620
...he found out he had.

163
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,370
- Yes!
- And aside from hating

164
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:07,620
the wrinkles he saw
in the rearview mirror

165
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:11,460
around his eyes and brow,
George Sr. was happy.

166
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,840
♪ All you need is smiles ♪

167
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:18,090
♪ Lots and lots
of smiley smiles ♪

168
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:19,340
♪ All you need is... ♪

169
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,470
What the (bleep)
is he smiling about?

170
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,010
Hello!

171
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,720
Oh, we're just doing a survey

172
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,010
for the U.S. government, ma'am.

173
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,310
Oh, no, I-I'm a man.

174
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:31,980
I was just wearing,
uh, this blouse

175
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,860
because I was, uh, driving
and I hate my arms.

176
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,270
What's the tape for?

177
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,730
Laying out border coordinates

178
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,400
for when they put up the wall.

179
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,780
Shh! You're not supposed
to tell them what it's for.

180
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,320
Well, he already
mentioned the tape,

181
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,620
and he looks American.

182
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,660
- Yeah, but he's in Mexico.
- Wait.

183
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,450
Guys, no, no, Mexico starts

184
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:50,370
- back there, by the gully.
- Whoever told you that's

185
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,460
probably chomping on the maca,
if you know what I mean.

186
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,000
So, what you're saying
to me is that

187
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,590
on this side of the tape,
I'm in Mexico,

188
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,340
but when I come over here...

189
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,760
Whoa. We're going to need
to see a passport, sir.

190
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,680
Pasaporte.

191
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,680
George Sr.
liked to make men

192
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,970
who disappoint him suffer.

193
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,720
But things change.

194
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:11,180
You really hurt
my feelings, guys.

195
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,810
- No hugging... ma'am.
- I'm sorry.

196
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,150
George Sr.
had just discovered

197
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,360
that the millions of dollars
of American property

198
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,740
he owned was worthless.

199
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,120
How did you not notice?

200
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,620
You saw all the papers.

201
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,240
And in Mexico.

202
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:31,790
You can't expect me to read
every page of that deal.

203
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,550
Besides, that one
was particularly difficult

204
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,290
because it was all in Spanish.

205
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,420
It says very clearly,
on my business card,

206
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,840
"Se habla español."

207
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,340
"I do not speak Spanish."

208
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,540
And it was your brother Oscar

209
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,260
who told me it
was on the border.

210
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,930
How did he not know?

211
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:48,100
Unfortunately,
Oscar missed the signs.

212
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,100
You think it's okay
to burn these?

213
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,470
Well, this is America.

214
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,230
If they don't want us
to burn signs,

215
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,270
they shouldn't write them
in Spanish.

216
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:59,190
- Everybody!
- ♪ Sign, sign, everywhere a sign... ♪

217
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,360
Only Heartfire knew the truth.

218
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,200
But the singing was so loud,
no one could hear her thoughts.

219
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,280
I bribed Love

220
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,580
to push for the building
of the wall,

221
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,540
and I don't have the land
to build it on!

222
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,330
Shh, shh, shh.
Call Herbert Love, all right?

223
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:15,330
Tell him you would
greatly appreciate it

224
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,920
if he'd rescind his support
for the wall.

225
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,000
And make him a flip-flopper?
I can't do that.

226
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,460
Actually, he'd tried,

227
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,050
but couldn't afford it.

228
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:25,220
It's a 40 for the flip
and a 40 for the flop,

229
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,970
and since it's going to cause
a flap, I'd say another 40.

230
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:31,680
So it's a flat 40-40-40
flip-flop and a flap fee.

231
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,390
Well, then find someone
who has influence with him.

232
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,940
Hold on.
A client is, uh, coming,

233
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,480
and I don't know where Oscar is.

234
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,730
He's disappeared.

235
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:40,820
And there is something up
with him

236
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,900
because he is scary now.

237
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,150
He has changed.

238
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,030
Hey, you've changed,
you big (bleep).

239
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:47,700
You're acting
like a little girl lately.

240
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,990
And not in the good way.

241
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,550
Pull yourself together.
Act like a man.

242
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:51,990
You're right, you're right.

243
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:55,000
- Okay, love you.
- Love you, too. Bye.

244
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,620
Cash, no receipt.

245
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,420
- Hot day, Father.
- Hot day, Father B.

246
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,460
- Hot day.
- Hot day, Father.

247
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,500
Hello, Father.

248
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,840
Don't call me that!

249
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,210
What are you doing here?

250
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,260
- You and Mom talked about it.
- We did...?

251
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,390
Oscar.

252
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:12,350
In fact, it was Oscar
who spoke to Lucille

253
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:16,140
about hiring Gob, but not
before an ominous warning.

254
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,810
But, you know,
he has magical abilities.

255
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:22,440
He can handle a lot more
than we give him credit for.

256
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,030
I know... What?!

257
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:27,190
I would have been here sooner,
but I had to go down

258
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,820
to San Diego
and loop my way back up

259
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,530
because they put up
that border ribbon.

260
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,030
- Which is totally new,
- Shh!

261
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,620
and I wasn't expecting it;
it's fine.

262
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,660
Anyway, Father,
you've got to get me a job

263
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,370
so I can be prepared...
to be president.

264
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,500
All right, you got to keep this
"father" stuff to yourself.

265
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,040
I can't have these people think
that I raised a limo driver.

266
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,750
I'm not a limo driver.

267
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,420
I'm a gentleman honey farmer.

268
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,510
The only thing I've got
back there are my bees.

269
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,840
- Beans?
- No, bees!

270
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,680
- Bees?
- Bees!

271
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,720
Bees! Oh, bees!

272
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,600
The boxes fell over
on the way here

273
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,180
when I had to swerve
to avoid an ostrich.

274
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,980
You got to do something
about this--these people

275
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,270
paid a lot of money.
Do something!

276
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,440
No, they won't listen to me.

277
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,190
- They've all got CCD.
- CCD?

278
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,440
Colony collapse disorder.

279
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,270
The guy sold me
just really sick bees.

280
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,070
Don't worry.
Dad, they're going to hive.

281
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,400
They always hive.

282
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,150
Usually by seeking out

283
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,030
a structure
that most resembles a hive.

284
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:15,240
Bees! Wonderful bees!

285
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,290
It's okay.
It's okay. Gob, get in there

286
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,120
- and get them out!
- Okay, I'm on it.

287
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,920
But then George Sr.
got some more bad news.

288
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,420
Hello, brother.
Thought I'd find you

289
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,960
in a blouse and a beekeeper hat.

290
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,420
What are you doing here?
No, no, no, no, no.

291
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,170
We cannot be seen
next to each other.

292
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,420
I'm Dr. Norman!

293
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:31,720
Well, if you don't want
to be seen, then you

294
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,180
go in the sweat lodge.
You owe me.

295
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,560
Is that a fact?
Listen, you told me

296
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,520
the property was on the border.

297
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,440
It is 50 feet south
of the border, Oscar.

298
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,150
Well, excuse me, but they hadn't
put up the tape yet.

299
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:47,570
So I was going off Buster's map.

300
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,570
Oh, God, it was Buster's map.

301
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,360
Buster had indeed made the map,

302
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,110
as a cartography student,

303
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,740
because the class where you get
to see naked people,

304
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,700
and draw them, was full.

305
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,200
And you lied to me.

306
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,290
You told me you bought
this property to live on.

307
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:06,090
No, you bought this property
to put up a wall.

308
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:07,670
I told one lie,

309
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,800
but I-I was going to share
the money with you.

310
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,470
- Two lies.
- And why do I think

311
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:14,680
that you charge more than
five dollars for lemonade?

312
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,390
Three small lies.

313
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,680
Now, will you do me a favor,
just get in the tent.

314
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,060
Gob's getting rid of the bees,

315
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,600
and we'll push the matinee
till 3:00.

316
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,980
No, I'm sick and tired
of being in that hut

317
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,520
pretending to be you.

318
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,230
Maybe I should go out there
and pretend to be you.

319
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,530
So, good-bye, George.

320
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:32,150
This is the last
you'll see of me.

321
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:35,820
Just gonna use the can
for one second.

322
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:38,330
There's two Dr. Normans!

323
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,120
George Sr. headed up
north to see his wife

324
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,790
before his brother could,
but he soon found out

325
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:48,590
he was too late by a day.

326
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:50,340
Oh, I know what you're coming up

327
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,920
- to do to me.
- Right.

328
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,130
What?

329
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,880
Yesterday, you were amazing.

330
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:57,340
Georgie, I can't stop
thinking about it.

331
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:59,640
You haven't been
like that in years.

332
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,430
Oh, right.

333
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,640
- You mean, slow-witted?
- I hope you're ready

334
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,980
for more of the same today.

335
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,940
Uh...  Oh, God.

336
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,480
George Sr. had a few problems:

337
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,280
his brother was
sleeping with his wife,

338
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,860
the property he was going to
sell to the government...

339
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:18,370
to build the U.S. wall on
was in Mexico...

340
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:20,160
All right...
all right...

341
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,410
...and his sweat lodge colony
had just collapsed.

342
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,950
Okay.

343
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,750
So he had to deal with
first things first.

344
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:27,210
If my identical twin brother

345
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,750
can get it up, then shouldn't I?

346
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,000
Have you had any sexual feeling
at all lately?

347
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,630
No!

348
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,830
You know, the Hopi Indians
believe that this spot here,

349
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,380
- Okay.
- when manipulated,

350
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:39,800
- can create sexual feeling.
- That's my penis.

351
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:42,180
Well, you don't have to tell me.
Nothing?

352
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,770
No, just a little curiosity

353
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,730
as to why you're checking
your second hand.

354
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,900
Oh, this isn't my office.

355
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,690
You know, I-I don't get it.

356
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:52,230
I've been popping the pills,
and, I mean, I mean, nothing.

357
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,280
- Are you under any pressure?
- Oh, no.

358
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,820
Nothing out of the ordinary.

359
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,700
I mean, there's some
violating federal law stuff

360
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:00,030
that'd put me in prison
for the rest of my life,

361
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:03,080
but I've made love with
treason charges over me before.

362
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,330
But no, it's something else.

363
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:05,540
It's not just the sex.

364
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:08,120
I feel...

365
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:10,580
I feel wrong.

366
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,340
Somehow.

367
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:17,260
And I'm becoming weak.

368
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:19,890
Sorry, had the old
thinking cap on.

369
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:21,680
Let's go to the lists.

370
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,390
And Dr. Norman
proceeded to run through

371
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:25,430
a checklist of alternative
medicine questions.

372
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,930
Okay, did you drink some water
that might have

373
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,560
a homeopathic memory
of some molecule?

374
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,770
Do you keep track

375
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,150
of the molecules you ingest?

376
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:32,560
Well, with homeopathy,

377
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,070
it's the molecules
you don't ingest.

378
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,440
But I'm the one
who can get hard,

379
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,110
so let's focus on you.

380
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,450
He then went on to explore
some supernatural

381
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:40,970
or high-concept
premise possibilities.

382
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:42,700
Any earthquakes
in a Chinese restaurant

383
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,700
- while you were trying to prove
something to your mother? - No.

384
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,080
Any wishes you may have
phrased badly,

385
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,830
or while a child
was blowing out a candle?

386
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,460
No.

387
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,290
Have you come across
any ancient games, let's say,

388
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,590
glowing games, uh, either
board based or carnival based,

389
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:57,090
that you may have played against
the wishes of your best friend?

390
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,130
- No.
- Curses, hexes, spells,

391
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:03,010
shaman, medicine men?

392
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,680
Wait.

393
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,100
The strong will become the weak.

394
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,770
The weak will become the strong.

395
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:13,730
I did hallucinate one ancient
foreboding warrior harbinger

396
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,150
while I chewed maca root
about a year ago.

397
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,940
Could that be something?

398
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,780
No, it's not the maca.

399
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,990
Your body wants the maca.

400
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,360
It's not the maca.

401
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:24,450
But finally,
out of desperation,

402
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:25,950
he turned to Western medicine.

403
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,700
Okay, tell you what,
let's get some film on you.

404
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,080
I'd like you to get
on an MRI machine

405
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,620
and try to ride it to climax.

406
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,210
I'm gonna send you over
to Orange County Imaging--

407
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,000
they do a ton of that.

408
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,590
Okay, do I get magazines?

409
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,630
Yeah, I'll write you
a script for that.

410
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:41,130
They got a place right around
the corner that plays ball.

411
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,510
Thank you.

412
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,890
Oh, (bleep). Run.

413
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:46,760
What? Oh.

414
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:49,520
And soon, after getting
his prescription filled...

415
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,520
Uh... hola...

416
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,940
I have a, um--magazines?

417
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,610
...he was on his way

418
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:01,030
to debase himself
in an MRI machine

419
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:04,780
when he ran into a son
with whom he'd lost touch.

420
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,750
Dad, what are you doing here?

421
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:13,830
I wanted to speak to you...
in person.

422
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,420
Then you're here to apologize;
that right?

423
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,140
- Sure.
- Although, he covered pretty well.

424
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:21,050
And-and of course to see you
at Orange County Im-a-gine.

425
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:24,180
I went to you
for a simple signature,

426
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,470
and you told me to go to hell.

427
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,930
Actually, it was
the newly potent Oscar,

428
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,310
who, like one of
Gob's sick bees,

429
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:34,400
was pollinating one barren
flower after another,

430
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,350
who told Michael to go to hell.

431
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,360
- Go to hell.
- Huh?

432
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,520
Which is how George Sr.

433
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:41,440
not only was left with
Senor Senoritas,

434
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,820
and that's when he got a lead
on his wall problem.

435
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,530
Do you know a guy
named Herbert Love?

436
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,120
I know a lot of people, sure.

437
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,410
And soon, he surprised Michael

438
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,490
by giving him his rights
for the movie project.

439
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:55,870
I didn't know it was about
lying to a girl.

440
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,710
- Give me the release.
- You'd do this for me?

441
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,710
- Of course I will.
- And then, didn't surprise him.

442
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,050
If you'll do something for me.

443
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:05,180
I knew it.

444
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,890
Michael, you got to get
this Love guy against the wall

445
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:10,180
between the U.S. and Mexico.

446
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,600
That's not right.

447
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,930
You're really opposed
to this wall, huh?

448
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,100
When did you
become pro-immigrant?

449
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,230
I have changed, Michael.

450
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:17,810
I cry

451
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:20,730
at the drop of a hat,
and I hate the way I look.

452
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:23,780
I actually had one cute hat,
and it...

453
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:28,620
it blew off
at the CVS parking lot.

454
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:31,580
And this whole car
full of black kids ran over it,

455
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,700
for no reason.

456
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,410
And they saw it!

457
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,250
They saw it!

458
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:39,040
Michael...

459
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:44,340
Anyway, I live down there now.

460
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,800
And I care for these people
who just want

461
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,850
to come into this country
and ply their wares

462
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:52,720
and let us freely fill the bay
with their culture.

463
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,720
Hey, don't get me started
on the Cinco, Dad.

464
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:56,520
I haven't been to one
in 20 years.

465
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,270
There's gonna be blowback there;
it's just gonna happen.

466
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,440
You can't swim in that bay
for a month after

467
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,230
without getting
nacho cheese sauce in your hair.

468
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,530
It's coming.

469
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:05,900
Can you help me, then,
with Love?

470
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,740
At his speech, at Cinco?

471
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,700
Can you do that for your dad?

472
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:12,870
What he didn't tell Michael was
that the family would go broke

473
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:14,870
if they had to build the wall.

474
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,960
Of course I will.

475
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,210
Maybe, if he had,
Michael wouldn't have

476
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,630
overplayed his hand
as a big-shot producer

477
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:25,590
who knew lots of people.

478
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:27,050
But a deal was soon struck...

479
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:28,630
- Thanks, Pop.
- All right.

480
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,550
...and Michael,
signed contract in hand,

481
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,680
went to show off
at the Ealing Club,

482
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,140
while George Sr.,
magazine in hand,

483
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,930
went to (bleep) off
in an MRI machine.

484
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,900
George Sr. finally
went to visit a wife

485
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,910
who was under the impression
that he was back for more.

486
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,320
The wrong land?

487
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,240
It's under control;
I'm trying to get Love

488
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,870
to come out against the wall.

489
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:57,330
We can't afford to build it
if we're not

490
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:59,290
selling the land
back to the government.

491
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:00,830
It'll ruin us.

492
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:03,170
It'll ruin us
if we don't build it.

493
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:05,840
George, you've gone puny again.

494
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,300
Where's the man who took
ahold of me yesterday

495
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,720
and bent me over this couch?

496
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,510
Okay, okay,
let's not sully its memory.

497
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:16,720
Look, we make sure Herbert Love
comes out against the wall,

498
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:18,810
right after we get
enough of it up

499
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:20,730
to trigger
the government payment.

500
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:23,480
And speaking of
getting enough of it up,

501
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,150
what's going on down here?

502
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:28,690
You need a little more Marilyn
like I did yesterday?

503
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,780
♪ Happy birthday,
Mr. President... ♪

504
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,280
I-I don't want to be
Mr. President.

505
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,080
Huh. Especially with
all this going down.

506
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,370
Oh, and speaking of president,
what's happening with Gob?

507
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,710
You gave him a job?

508
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,460
Yes, but then I-I fired him.

509
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,330
He caused my colony to collapse.

510
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:47,670
Oh, my God, George,
get him another job.

511
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,470
You must have some favors
you can call in somewhere.

512
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:54,680
And then you can have some of
my favors, Mr. President.

513
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,470
As much as I'd like to stay

514
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,930
and lay some more pipe with you,

515
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,850
I better get moving
on this thing.

516
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:01,100
And so, the next day,

517
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,480
George Sr. once again
called upon his son.

518
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,020
Michael B. Project.

519
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,980
Yeah, you got to give Gob a job.

520
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,570
Something in
the, uh, building company

521
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:11,570
or, uh, hey, I think
he'd get a big kick

522
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:12,860
out of the movie business.

523
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,110
N-N-No, Dad, hey.

524
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,870
He knows nothing
about producing.

525
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:18,120
Look, I don't care
if it's producing a movie

526
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,540
that's never gonna be made

527
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,790
or selling houses
that no one's gonna buy,

528
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:24,290
I just want my son
to have a job

529
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:27,170
where his incompetence
won't be out of place.

530
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:29,380
Anyway, he's on his way
to Sudden Valley now.

531
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,260
No, he isn't.
No, no, come on, Dad...

532
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,720
- No, no, now?
- What, what?

533
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,260
He's gonna make it
less valuable?

534
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,720
Which I told you
was gonna happen, by the way.

535
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,050
Oh, here it is.
Here it is.

536
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,930
Yeah, there it is!
Knew it was coming.

537
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:41,430
And even though George
had imposed on Michael,

538
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,850
it was Gob...

539
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,730
What the hell?

540
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:46,770
...who felt
he had a cross to bear.

541
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,530
What the hell?

542
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,780
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, I got the right of--

543
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,540
- Hey, hey, hey...
- N-No, don't. It's mine.

544
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,450
- Okay, coming through here.
- Mine... Hah!

545
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:59,120
No... no, no!
My right of... way!

546
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,700
- There! Mine!
- Okay.

547
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:01,950
Hey...

548
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:07,670
Gob!

549
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:09,170
Michael!

550
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:10,460
And the two brothers
reunited...

551
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,550
Hey, Gob.

552
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,590
Michael.

553
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,170
...happy to see each other.

554
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,680
Gob?

555
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,140
At first.

556
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,600
Michael.

557
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,520
So, hear you need help moving

558
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,480
these memorials to the death
of the housing market.

559
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,730
Actually that was a memorial

560
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,190
- to the death of Pete the mailman.
- I knew that.

561
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,610
I brought one, too--
size of the man's heart.

562
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,450
I just got to figure out
how to get it out of the car.

563
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:39,370
If I could remember
how I got it in.

564
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:41,330
That's not
from your Christian magic act?

565
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,540
Christian magic act?

566
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,960
If I were Muslim, would you say
"Muslim magic act"?

567
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
No, but it is hard to imagine
any Muslim handcuffing himself

568
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,920
to a glittery cross
and living to tell about it.

569
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,300
Yeah, well, the Christians
aren't so (bleep)-hot

570
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,090
about it either.

571
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,470
Hmm, well...

572
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:02,140
Michael could see
that his brother was unhappy

573
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,930
and that his life had not
worked out

574
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,810
the way he had hoped.

575
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:09,770
Things are incredible for me,
I'm having an incredible year.

576
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,320
I am a movie producer now,
producing a movie,

577
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,820
so they've got me
in this enormous office.

578
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,300
I told 'em
I don't want to be driving

579
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,900
to Beverly Hills
every single day,

580
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:20,200
so they put me in an enormous
office just over here.

581
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,540
Rental.

582
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:27,410
My personal life is off
the charts. I've met someone.

583
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:30,290
Can't really give you any
information--kind of famousy.

584
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,960
- Well, good for you. I also met someone.
- Have you?

585
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,500
Also famousy.
Can't give you any information.

586
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:37,090
In fact, Michael didn't even
find out who she was

587
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,220
until one night, earlier.

588
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,640
Oh, my God. I'm dating Ron
Howard's girlfriend.

589
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,260
Although he did have
some of the details wrong.

590
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:46,390
She's an actress.
You know her.

591
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:49,650
She was Ron's
illegitimate daughter,

592
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:51,060
a fact unbeknownst to many.

593
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,940
Well, we kind of like to keep
that quiet.

594
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:57,150
A woman who, like Bryce Dallas
and Paige Carlyle,

595
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:00,160
was named after
where she was conceived.

596
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:04,030
And she actually had worked
for some A-list directors.

597
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,490
She did a Terrence Malick...

598
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,790
Are we the same?

599
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,290
She got the lead
in a Woody Allen film...

600
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:11,010
But I felt like I was in
The Iceman Cometh,

601
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,540
but, you know,
in my case, he faketh.

602
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:15,710
...and was once even directed
by her own father.

603
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,840
Action!

604
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,800
Next time, don't pocket it,

605
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,840
pay for it.

606
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,260
Shoplifting: not cool.

607
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,180
- ...in a public service announcement.
- And cut!

608
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,350
Which, like all of
Ron's work...

609
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:27,560
You know, I think we got it.

610
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,640
...was inspired
by a photograph.

611
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:31,390
Rebel was indeed a rebel.

612
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,400
But Michael didn't possess
that information.

613
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,400
I can give you some information
about your airless office

614
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,980
you're gonna be spending
most mornings in.

615
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,440
You know, what I could go for
is some guac.

616
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:40,950
Well, you don't live there
anymore, Gob.

617
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:43,200
This heat just makes,
makes me want guac.

618
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,240
Now, now, I know
I've got these things,

619
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,790
uh, very, you know,
meticulously maintained.

620
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:50,290
There's...

621
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:51,500
There are some vultures.

622
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,670
I think they might
still smell Pete.

623
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:55,670
Yeah, if it wasn't for the movie
thing, I would do it myself.

624
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,340
They practically sell
themselves; you just got

625
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:59,460
- to bring the people in.
- I'm ready to move in today.

626
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:01,340
No, well, people other than you,

627
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,970
- bring those people in.
- I'm starving.

628
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:04,260
Starving? No, you're not
gonna find anything here.

629
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,460
They've been abandoned for...

630
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:10,270
Lindsay.

631
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:13,140
No, no, this--maybe Tobias.

632
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,350
It was John Beard.

633
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,940
Shall we?

634
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,690
Well, the value of these homes
isn't gonna go down

635
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:18,940
if we don't sell one today.

636
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,650
Let me see
if I can find a, uh...

637
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,030
Do you have a bottle opener?

638
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:25,030
Great idea.

639
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,330
And after a few more drinks and
a little more depreciation...

640
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:29,370
- That was surprising.
- ...Michael admitted he had

641
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:30,790
a rival for his girlfriend.

642
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:33,500
You don't have to worry
about Ron Howard.

643
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,420
I mean, he's not
competition for you.

644
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,750
- Really?
- Yeah, I mean, the guy's

645
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,550
like 100 years old.
What's he gonna do,

646
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:39,920
poke you in the eyes?

647
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,090
Oh, you're confused.

648
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:42,170
Ron Howard directed Apollo 13.

649
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,880
You're thinking of Moe Howard,

650
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,890
the angry stooge who's been dead
for a quarter century.

651
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:47,720
Well, that's good 'cause the
whole time I'm thinking, like,

652
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,060
"unless she likes
a guy who's funny."

653
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,770
- Sure.
- Because that guy is funny.

654
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:52,310
- 'Cause the whole time you're like...
- You know...

655
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:54,100
- "Is he gonna poke me in the eyes?"
- Gob,

656
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:56,690
I don't think that th-the
movie--it might not even happen

657
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:58,730
because I don't think
that I can ask my son.

658
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:01,400
What happened between him and me
was very disappointing.

659
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,450
You don't need to tell me
about disappointment and sons.

660
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:06,410
Let's not forget Steve Holt.

661
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:08,830
That's the story
of our relationship.

662
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:11,040
Right, well, I was talking about
a son disappointing a father.

663
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,620
Yeah, that does make it
different.

664
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,120
Look, Michael,
he doesn't respect you,

665
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,420
so you have
to make him respect you.

666
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,000
Show him that you're a big shot,

667
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,040
that you don't need to
live in your son's dorm.

668
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:22,260
No, I just live
in my parents' penthouse now.

669
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,090
Well, then, take him to the
Ealing Club; it's all showbiz.

670
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,510
I used to hang out there
all the time.

671
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:27,550
It's just actresses
and stuff like that.

672
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:29,220
I don't know
if I could pick up the phone

673
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,060
and call him and ask him.

674
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,470
- You know what, Michael?
- Hmm?

675
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,310
I'll call him for you.

676
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,400
Really, you'd do that for me?

677
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,940
It's the least I could do.

678
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:41,020
You've given me
a new sense of purpose.

679
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:43,940
Did you actually have
an old one?

680
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,940
'Cause it always seemed
like you were just looking

681
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:47,320
for the easy way out.

682
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,870
Yeah, that was it.

683
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:52,540
Hi, I'm George Bluth
of the Bluth Company, and, uh...

684
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,460
George Sr.,
meanwhile, was also finding

685
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,900
an easy way out
of the wall problem.

686
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:57,330
...we've built this wall.

687
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:01,590
We have miles and,
and miles of wall.

688
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:03,550
Will you confirm that, soldier?

689
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:07,630
It's ab-about protecting
our border,

690
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,430
which is why, uh,
we have a member

691
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:12,430
of our armed forces
with us today.

692
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,220
Say hello.

693
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:18,270
It's, uh, triple-reinforced,
steel-reinforced,

694
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:21,190
and I don't really
know how to, how to say

695
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:24,570
that, uh, what it does is,
it protects, um...

696
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:26,150
It's Mexican-proof.

697
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,950
So-- can't say-- it...

698
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,780
Well, gosh darn it,

699
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,660
it is Mexican-proof.

700
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:34,030
Sit up.

701
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,290
- Uh...
- Daddy, my tummy's turning.

702
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:36,710
All right.

703
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,250
- Uh, it's, uh, triple-reinforced.
- I got...

704
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:39,580
Daddy, I got to get out,

705
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,040
- I got to get out.
- Uh, we're gonna be...

706
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,380
Oh, for God's sakes, get out.

707
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,960
I need to get out,
I need to get out.

708
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,710
- Oh, for...
- I need to get out, I need to get out.

709
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,590
We're not gonna... we'll edit
this part out and, uh...

710
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,340
Anyhow...

711
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:52,970
But George Sr.
hadn't built miles of wall.

712
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:57,100
He just found a roundabout way
to make it seem that way,

713
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,560
and one week later at Cinco,
George arrived,

714
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,980
hoping to hear Herbert Love...

715
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,810
No, thanks. I've already crushed
one with my car.

716
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:05,820
...sway public opinion
against the wall

717
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,650
so the Bluth Company
wouldn't be on the hook

718
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:09,070
- to build it for real.
- Pop, hey, hi.

719
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:11,030
- Michael, what happened?
- Yeah.

720
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,990
Oh, the--it's a terrible week,

721
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,410
but I'm gonna fix things
once and for all right now.

722
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:17,040
- Is this about Love?
- No, it's about money,

723
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:22,040
but I-I'm--I will pay her back,
uh, one way or the other.

724
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,130
Who?

725
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:24,460
Lucille 2--I'm gonna get her

726
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,300
- against the wall.
- No, no, no, no, no,

727
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,170
she cannot know about this wall.

728
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:30,470
Fine, I'll get her up against
the top of the staircar.

729
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:32,430
I don't care,
it's gonna happen, though.

730
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:34,050
I am talking about Herbert Love.

731
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:36,720
- Is he going to oppose the
building of the wall? - Oh, yes.

732
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:38,270
I took care of that.

733
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:40,560
He is going to announce that
in his speech tonight.

734
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,560
That is great news.

735
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,310
Listen, I-I-I have to go.

736
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:46,270
I have to see if I can pass
this testosterone test.

737
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,820
I do, too.

738
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,990
And, listen, not a word to...

739
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,650
How dare you?

740
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:55,120
Lucille 2.

741
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,080
Did you think
I wouldn't find out?

742
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,580
I was going to cut you in.

743
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,830
I was trying to protect you

744
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:01,790
so they wouldn't link you to it,

745
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:04,380
but it turns out that we can't
afford to build it anyway.

746
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:08,050
- Build what?
- The wall in Mexico, the, the high wall.

747
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:10,380
- What were, what were you talking about?
- I was talking

748
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:13,800
about you giving money
to Herbert Love in his campaign

749
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,890
- against me.
- Oh, no, no,

750
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:18,060
that was to get Love
to support the wall.

751
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,350
Oh, I tell you, I've been
all over the place on this one.

752
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:23,140
I can't be running a company
that's building a wall

753
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:24,400
I campaigned against!

754
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,070
Listen to me,
it's taken care of.

755
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,150
I just ran into Michael.

756
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:31,070
He's got Love against the wall.

757
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:33,320
It's done, it's gonna be in
the speech tonight, it's over.

758
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,910
It better be,

759
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:37,780
or I'll talk about it
in my speech tonight.

760
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:40,330
Now, I've got a staircar
to wave from.

761
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:41,750
And I can't be seen with you.

762
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:43,160
'Cause I'm fat.

763
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:45,170
It's because I am fat.

764
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:47,210
You think I'm a fat person.

765
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,630
You are such a drama queen.

766
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:50,840
George Sr. was worried.

767
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,380
These fat arms.

768
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,930
I don't understand this.

769
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:56,760
And so, it was in
a state of agitation

770
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,350
that George Sr. arrived
for his doctor's appointment.

771
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:00,560
Excuse me, Dr. Norman?

772
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,560
- You're mistaken.
- Dr. Norman,

773
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,600
it's me, George Bluth.

774
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,520
Oh, George, yes,
thank you for meeting me here.

775
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:12,740
I like to do a little
housecleaning on the fourth.

776
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,910
Old quinceañera candles.

777
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:19,990
I was wondering if you could
tell me my test results.

778
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,410
Oh, yes, yes, uh, well,

779
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,370
your testosterone numbers
are off the charts.

780
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,750
Below the charts,
under the charts.

781
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,670
I don't know how to say that.

782
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:29,380
You have almost
no testosterone at all.

783
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,380
I don't know the exact numbers,
but it's somewhere

784
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,880
in the baby range.

785
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,300
On the plus side,
your estrogen levels are that

786
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:38,180
of a very healthy woman
in the throes of her menses.

787
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,060
May I see my results?

788
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,850
Ah, I wish you'd asked me
about five minutes ago.

789
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:43,100
I think I dumped it
with a pot pipe

790
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,430
and a bottle
of cheetah sedative.

791
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,440
Also, the people
at Orange County Imaging

792
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,730
said that you were masturbating
in an MRI tube?

793
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:52,030
- Oh, no.
- But, Doctor,

794
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:53,190
you, you told me to.

795
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:54,360
I did no such thing.

796
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,320
Oh, no.

797
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,320
No, no, you can't do that.

798
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,030
That sounds like something
I would say

799
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,580
when I had my thinking cap on.

800
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,370
You, sir, are a very funny lady.

801
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,500
That's what they always say
to the unattractive one.

802
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:14,460
It was finally time
for Herbert Love

803
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:18,470
to make his speech, when the
party was suddenly ransacked.

804
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:20,140
Of course, it was Cinco,

805
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,760
so it took a while
for anyone to notice.

806
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,720
It appeared
the Hispanic community had had

807
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:25,350
enough of Cinco de Cuatro.

808
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:27,480
- Oh, God, the blowback.
- Put up this wall!

809
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,400
But the blowback created
a greater blowback

810
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,070
as the crowd that had gathered
to hear Herbert Love speak

811
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:33,320
was whipped into a frenzy.

812
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,940
Put up this wall!
Put up this wall!

813
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:38,650
And that's when George knew
he was in real trouble.

814
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,450
Put up this wall!

815
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:43,870
Fortunately,
he was able to find a disguise.

816
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,410
Oh, God.

817
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:51,540
- Unfortunately...
- This feels right.

818
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:59,130
Lindsay surprises Michael

819
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,220
after a long absence
from his life.

820
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,260
Lindsay.

821
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,890
It's been a long time.

822
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:06,220
I know.

823
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:09,230
Oh, this is
a little embarrassing.

824
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:10,770
But I have been meaning
to get down there,

825
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:12,650
- so let's just...
- You're right,

826
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:15,650
I mean, it's not like we're
even technically related.

827
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:19,650
- That's true.
- Okay, well, then, I'll start with a smear.

828
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,660
And George Sr. gets
more comfortable in hiding.

829
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,120
Yes?

830
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,040
Uh, Detective Smee,
Orange County Police.

831
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,370
I need to speak with you.

832
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:31,710
Lucille Austero went missing
last night.

833
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,630
- You mind if we ask you a few questions?
- Oh...!

834
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:35,500
I-I don't allow men
in my apartment

835
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:37,390
without my husband present.
