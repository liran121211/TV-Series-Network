1
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,750
George Michael Bluth had never been

2
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:14,250
more popular. No.

3
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:15,790
He was surrounded by people

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,380
who were thrilled to be in his company.

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,840
Carlos was just... tickling me.

6
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,550
They're almost out of root beer.

7
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:23,590
So I got you one with
the last bit of root beer

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,300
because I remember that
somebody was saying that, um,

9
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:26,720
George Michael likes root beer.

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,600
And as his business was taking off...

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,100
I do. Thanks a lot.

12
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,810
You guys don't have to
do all this, you know?

13
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:32,980
This was just a little
get-together for my girlfriend

14
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,850
to show her I'm doing well, you know?

15
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,190
- ... So was his romantic life.
- Show her I'm an adult.

16
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:37,400
Hey, stop it!

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,780
You're dead, man, you are so dead.

18
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,820
That was the last root beer snow cone.

19
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,240
I got that for him, Carlos.

20
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,740
Teach you for being such a kiss ass, Terry.

21
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:44,990
And it was an ex-Bluth Company employee...

22
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,830
Come on, you guys, not cool.

23
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:48,870
Who was the most grateful
to be in his company.

24
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:51,000
- Want any of these?
- No, I'm fine.

25
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,120
You know, I really appreciate
you guys doing all this.

26
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:55,250
I just wish I understood...

27
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:56,920
why.

28
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,250
That's why... because you could ask us

29
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,170
why we do this, and mean it.

30
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,220
The fact that you could
be so down to earth...

31
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,720
And look so young.

32
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,680
While you're starting this giant company.

33
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,760
You created an opportunity many of us

34
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,560
thought we'd never have again.

35
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:15,600
See that's the part I
don't understand, Carlos.

36
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,270
You know my name! What's his name?

37
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,820
- You're the kiss-ass, Carlos.
- What's his name?

38
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:20,230
Okay, guys, I'm gonna learn all your names.

39
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,780
- I promise.
- George.

40
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,450
- And that's when he heard what
- Rebel.

41
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,660
- Had become his name.
- What is all this?

42
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,990
Oh, it's just a little surprise.

43
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,700
- You did this for me?
- Yes!

44
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,490
Well... well, they did it for me, but...

45
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:33,410
but only because they knew I
wanted to do something for you.

46
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,210
Maybe we could talk without your friends.

47
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,710
I mean, these guys aren't
really my friends, you know.

48
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:38,920
I barely know their names.

49
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,920
I mean, I know Carlos, but...

50
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,630
only because of that old song
"Carlos the Tickle Monster."

51
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,180
Wait, what song is that?

52
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,640
Oh, god, I knew he made that up.

53
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,510
But it did help me remember.

54
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,060
Anyway, don't worry about these
guys... they're not listening

55
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,470
to a word we're saying.

56
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,520
How about that kiss?

57
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,930
We need to talk.

58
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,110
Now the story of a family

59
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,610
whose future was abruptly cancelled

60
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:04,990
and the one son who had no choice

61
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,240
but to keep himself together.

62
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:13,950
It's George Michael's Arrested Development.

63
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,830
George Michael's life was very different

64
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,840
months before developing

65
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,420
the software program that would

66
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,340
change his life.

67
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,510
♪ Those balls in the air ♪

68
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:30,350
♪ Those balls in the air. ♪

69
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,640
And...

70
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,680
that's where the song should've ended.

71
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,730
So I guess we all got
a little carried away.

72
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,860
Are you sure? We all
ended at the same time.

73
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,860
Yeah, well, it's because
you all sped up together.

74
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,110
Now, you know if I was

75
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,650
playing in your band, I would say,

76
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,320
"Hey, you know, let's do
the whole fast and loose

77
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,490
with tempo thing."

78
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:49,530
But this is about my demo tape

79
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,610
to Juilliard and they've got

80
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,240
to dig what I do so much

81
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,410
that they start an entire
department for wood block.

82
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,790
So I'm sorry guys.

83
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,250
And you're leaving, okay.

84
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:58,250
They left early.

85
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:59,790
Proves my point.

86
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:02,000
She was cute.

87
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,340
They were playing way
too loud anyway, right?

88
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,380
Could you even hear the wood block?

89
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,550
Right at the end.

90
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,470
We could record you separately,

91
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:08,800
and then mix it louder on the computer.

92
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,300
Well, then I'm not playing in a band.

93
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,970
I mean, the whole point of the band

94
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,890
is to showcase my amazing internal clock.

95
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,680
You know, that's something
you have to be born with.

96
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,180
Or bred with.

97
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,310
Which was the case with George Michael.

98
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,310
Who, as a small child,
appeared in a promotional video

99
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,520
for a developmental tool called "BabyTock"

100
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,570
BabyTock! will give your
child a head start at math.

101
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:30,530
And if I were a doctor,
I would guarantee you

102
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:34,120
that it would also boost
their brain power 110%.

103
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,000
That's a lot of brain power.

104
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,370
You've been using BabyTock!, correct?

105
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,670
- For how long?
- For two months.

106
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:45,040
But George Michael really
enjoys listening to the sound.

107
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,880
And would you say it's...

108
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,130
changed the power of his brain?

109
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,430
Uh, well, that's impossible...

110
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,390
To deny.

111
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,970
I've always wanted a smart baby.

112
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:58,060
This thing really works, George.

113
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,350
In fact it came from something that didn't.

114
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:04,520
So we're stuck with 5,000 of
these worthless corn-ballers?

115
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,070
When they were looking to
recoup some of their costs

116
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:09,740
after an ill-fated foray

117
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,240
into the fry-at-home snack-food market.

118
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,200
Whoa, whoa.

119
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,950
They're not worthless.

120
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,870
You know? The timer still works.

121
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:19,450
There's no numbers on it,
but it's very loud, so...

122
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,790
Perfect for those who
like the sound of a clock,

123
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,170
but don't know their numbers.

124
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,500
That's good.

125
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,630
We'll sell this to baby...

126
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,710
Mother of!

127
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,800
We should put these in cribs.

128
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,720
That's not a half puny thought.

129
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,010
And that Julliard thing is

130
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,220
confidential from my Dad by the way.

131
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,640
He's never gonna want me to pursue

132
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,680
- a career in...
- Hitting a block of wood.

133
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,480
Music, yes

134
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,520
You know, he still thinks of
me as the same George Michael

135
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,850
that I was before my life

136
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,360
blew apart, you know?

137
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,070
Before the world cracked me open

138
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:50,320
and I became the guy that
you're looking at now.

139
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,030
George Michael 2.0.

140
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:54,200
God, I hate my name.

141
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,780
The last five years

142
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,530
had been a whirlwind for George Michael.

143
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,450
He celebrated going off to college

144
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,790
- at a party with his family.
- Hey! Next week, huh?

145
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:04,670
- Congratulations!
- Thanks.

146
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:07,500
- We are so proud.
- We have a little something for you.

147
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,090
Oh, no, you don't have to do anything.

148
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:11,550
I mean, you threw me this... meeting.

149
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,090
Little something-something...

150
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,550
to buy a car.

151
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,260
Oh, God, really?

152
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,430
- No!
- Yes.

153
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,600
Maeby!

154
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,390
But the party wouldn't last long.

155
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,520
You know what?

156
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,060
I am done with this family.

157
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,520
I hope you've saved some money,

158
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,320
'cause you're going to need every dime now.

159
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,940
What's this?

160
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,860
Return it... or rip it up.

161
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,240
- Michael.
- Come on.

162
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,620
Give it a rip.

163
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,950
Rip it up... right down the center.

164
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:48,000
That's it. Rip it.

165
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,500
Couple more.

166
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,170
Did you get it?

167
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,550
Proud of you.

168
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:54,840
Happy birthday.

169
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,590
- Happy birthday, George Michael.
- Happy birthday.

170
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,220
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

171
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,640
- * Happy birthday to you... *
- But don't worry.

172
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,680
Michael did make sure his son got a car...

173
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,230
Get out of here.

174
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:10,810
As he sent him off to college.

175
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,320
And although he arrived at college

176
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,900
without his possessions,

177
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,070
he was finally at a place where he felt

178
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,030
he'd fit in.

179
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,160
Hey, hey, check it out.

180
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,170
N... no.

181
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:32,840
No, no.

182
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,590
What?

183
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,220
In his Freshman year, George Michael

184
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:43,180
- hit the ground running.
- Sorry.

185
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,890
He was breaking some of the old taboos.

186
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:47,560
- Let's make it a... Pepsi.
- Drinking Pepsi in the morning.

187
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,400
So, it's a breakfast combo with a Pepsi.

188
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,560
Sometimes having eggs at night.

189
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,650
How about some eggs?

190
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,440
Oh, excuse me, I forgot it wasn't morning.

191
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,570
He was soon finding that others
enjoyed his sense of humor.

192
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,780
I forgot it wasn't morning.

193
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,570
A present from his Uncle Gob elevated

194
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,200
- his newfound confidence.
- Hi.

195
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,450
My uncle is a magician.

196
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,160
Before diminishing it.

197
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,710
But before he knew it

198
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,750
sophomore year was upon him,

199
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:15,420
- and everything got turned up to 11.
- Boom!

200
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:18,800
And that's what we call
only being behind by three.

201
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,550
So then that stuff's all going
on with this Sitwell company.

202
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:23,600
And then... we end up playing
them in a softball game.

203
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,140
Highlights... loyal friends.

204
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,770
I'm like, "How can that...?"

205
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,640
Romance.

206
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:30,770
Becky.

207
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:32,270
Betrayal.

208
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,860
Becky?

209
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,190
What's up, Ray?

210
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,570
You guys broke up.

211
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:39,490
Oh, thanks, Ray, I almost forgot.

212
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:42,780
The triumph of friendship.

213
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,950
- What's up, Ray?
- Hey.

214
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:46,240
Oh, thanks, Ray, I almost forgot.

215
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,870
You know who I was thinking
about before you sat down?

216
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:49,160
- What?
- Becky.

217
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:50,540
Do you remember?

218
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,960
And as surely as stability returned,

219
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,590
junior year ushered in a
new era of experimentation...

220
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,090
It's all about the science of kissing

221
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,630
between a man and a woman.

222
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:01,220
That always has fascinated me.

223
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,640
Oh, good. Sheila will take you.

224
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,140
As George Michael tried to compensate

225
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,640
for the lack of income from his father

226
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,430
by volunteering for experiments.

227
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,350
Hi.

228
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:15,190
So I don't run off?

229
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:17,570
- I hope you're not feeling too awkward.
- Oh, don't be crazy.

230
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:20,150
- Okay.
- Now when the mouth to mouth test begins,

231
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:23,360
I'm gonna be yelling out letters
that indicate mouth movements.

232
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:24,910
What I need you to do is just give me

233
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,580
on a scale of one to
ten your pleasure level.

234
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,870
- Fine.
- Ten being the most
pleasurable, one the least.

235
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,710
Let's hope we get to ten.

236
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,580
- Well, work our way up to it.
- Bringing in the mouth unit!

237
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,920
And that's when he realized
what the straps were for.

238
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,300
Is that...? Okay, I guess it's
not, uh, not gonna be a person.

239
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,260
- And C?
- I think one on C.

240
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,430
- M? M?
- Oh, one on...

241
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:45,970
- M?
- One for sure on... one.

242
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,310
- And Z?
- One.

243
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,430
- N?
- One.

244
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:50,270
- F? F?
- One. One.

245
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,730
But it wasn't until his year abroad

246
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:55,150
that George Michael got
an education in life.

247
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:01,320
Because after a year of trying
not to be an imposing guest

248
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,780
in his new country,

249
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,700
he was ready

250
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:08,370
for a summer that would end up
turning his life upside down...

251
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:15,630
when the woman whose
children he was nannying...

252
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,130
opened him up sexually.

253
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:22,590
Hey, hey, did Ernesto get his 4: 00?

254
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,340
The drones are coming.

255
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,090
Nothing matters now.

256
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,100
- Why do you kiss like this?
- Like what?

257
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,360
The teeth, they must not be used like this.

258
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,230
It was actually a jaw and lip

259
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:41,530
retraction issue, but
she had neither a command

260
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:44,700
of the language nor the data that we do.

261
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,160
You make love like a boy.

262
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,660
Spanish, speak to me in Spanish.

263
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,580
Because the only way that college credit is

264
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,830
actually activated is if I have...

265
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:54,460
- Tómame.
- Cook... cook at...

266
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,080
- Cooking at you?
- Overpower me.

267
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,170
Oh, yes, make me cry.

268
00:09:58,210 --> 00:09:59,540
You're a terrible mother.

269
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,760
And so it was a very
different George Michael

270
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,430
that returned to school for senior year.

271
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,350
Eager to unleash his new

272
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:12,640
overt sexuality on an unsuspecting campus.

273
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,020
Hey, man.

274
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,810
It gets better.

275
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,440
And for George Michael,

276
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,820
senior year did get better.

277
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,780
- He was like a king
- I sort of feel like a king

278
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,030
- returning to his castle...
- Returning to his castle.

279
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,910
Only to discover that they thought

280
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:28,530
he was two kings.

281
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:30,030
Welcome to your castle.

282
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:32,990
And they had doubled
the size of his castle.

283
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,330
Double castle.

284
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,210
Can't wait to meet Michael, George.

285
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,290
It would be the perfect backdrop

286
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:40,790
to unveil George Michael 2.0.

287
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,420
Todo mio.

288
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:45,380
Todo mia?

289
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,510
Mio.

290
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,260
But George Michael's development was about

291
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,810
- to be forestalled.
- Hey.

292
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:57,350
- Dad.
- Pete died.

293
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,690
Oh, God.

294
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:02,150
- Uh, who's, uh, Pete?
- Don't worry about it.

295
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,900
Don't you worry about it.

296
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,190
I like this.

297
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,740
- I like the mustache.
- Oh, yeah.

298
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,740
- Oh... it's kind of fun.
- That's great.

299
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,030
Probably gonna want to shave it off

300
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,700
before the start of next quarter.

301
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,240
Otherwise, they're gonna
think you're a musician, huh?

302
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,370
But I love it... dude.

303
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,160
I'm never going to be

304
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,540
louder than an electric guitar.

305
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,880
Maybe using a band to showcase

306
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,630
my wood block skill is a dumb idea.

307
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,250
Too bad there's no such thing

308
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,960
as an electric wood block.

309
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:28,760
That sounds like a mother of an invention.

310
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,760
And so they set to work

311
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,640
inventing a downloadable app

312
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,720
that would allow one to
play an electronic version

313
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,560
of a wood block on their smartphone.

314
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,430
You see, that's important.

315
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,850
Well, that's what it is.

316
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,480
So it's basically like you'll always

317
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,860
have a wood block with you.

318
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,820
I can't believe nobody's ever done this.

319
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,240
A quick something search
would have shown the guys

320
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,990
that there were already three
wood block apps on the market.

321
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,910
So, there are three on the market.

322
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:57,300
- Which they did.
- Así estamos en la jungla.

323
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,960
But even after doing that search,

324
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,370
they were undeterred.

325
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:02,670
Download them. Come on, let's do it.

326
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,750
I hope we're not doing this on my account.

327
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,420
No, we're doing it so that we can see

328
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,710
what the competition is like.

329
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,760
No, I mean on my iTunes account.

330
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,130
It's 99 cents.

331
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,590
Yeah, times three.

332
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,390
And soon, they realized

333
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:17,560
what kind of competition
they were up against.

334
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,900
Well, these are a joke.

335
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,650
I know. Where are the mallet options?

336
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:27,190
There's no choice of
wood weight or grain type.

337
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:28,900
There's no diameter hole option.

338
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,530
I mean, what is this, BabyTock?

339
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:31,860
- BabyTock?
- You know, the sharp

340
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,660
metal box that you put in the crib.

341
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,370
Is that not a well-known...?

342
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:37,200
- But this is fine.
- And they set to work.

343
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,580
No, I understand that. I get that.

344
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,620
But it just seems like
you're leaving a hole

345
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,910
just right in the middle of the block.

346
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,920
It won't be a block on anything 3G.

347
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,090
Although some of the work had
to happen outside the room.

348
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:47,920
Buddy, is that schoolwork?

349
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,250
Which was challenging.

350
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,760
And soon, they were
close to finishing an app

351
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,180
they had decided to call...

352
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,850
Woodblock.

353
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:57,430
It's taken.

354
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,270
Blockwood.

355
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,560
It's taken.

356
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,100
And that's when he came up with...

357
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,310
Block of Wood?

358
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,730
- Which was also taken.
- Wow.

359
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:08,610
- Block-block?
- No.

360
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,320
People are going to think we're
in the chicken-noise business.

361
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,740
How is that a chicken noise?

362
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,240
You know... well, it's kind of hard to do

363
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,200
in these matador pants, but, you know...

364
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,740
- Block-bl...
- Fakeblock is available.

365
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,000
Do you want Fakeblock?

366
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,790
Oh, uh, okay. They have Fakeblock.

367
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,420
Okay, yes, we'll take that.

368
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,540
No problem. That's no problem.

369
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,460
Could you hang on to that for me, please?

370
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,960
And I'll call you back. Thank you.

371
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,470
It's $5,000 for the domain name,

372
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:36,430
and then there's this
whole XML Web site fee.

373
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:37,680
I got the last one.

374
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,470
That was 99 cents.

375
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,810
Times three.

376
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:42,520
And George Michael realized

377
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,100
he needed to bring in some cash.

378
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,600
We actually have a variety of subjects

379
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,480
that high school students need tutoring in.

380
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,070
If you want to just
take a look at that list

381
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,780
and let me know if there's anything there

382
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,690
- that you've handled before.
- There was...

383
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,150
although George Michael

384
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,070
couldn't imagine it was the same Maeby.

385
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:59,080
Is this "F" in "Maeby F."
her last name or her grade?

386
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,870
Oh, it's her last name.

387
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,330
But her most recent grade is...

388
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:06,120
well, this just shows
an Elvis Presley head.

389
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:08,920
So, that bad?

390
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,420
I'll take her.

391
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,090
Stay on top of her.

392
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:14,380
You may need to ride her pretty hard.

393
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,590
Hey, you must be...

394
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,390
What?

395
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,600
- This is the girl you broke up with?
- Huh?

396
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,640
I can't wear this.

397
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,390
Yeah, well, we dated for
a while, but, you know,

398
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,770
I was a kid, and I didn't know

399
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:27,770
how to kiss yet. I don't know,

400
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:29,190
for whatever reason, I listened to my dad

401
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,610
who said we shouldn't make it work.

402
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,610
- Was she your first?
- Cousin? No.

403
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:35,070
Why would you... why would
your mind go right to...? No.

404
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:37,030
No, it's just that he was right.

405
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:39,070
We were kids. I wasn't yet O.S.

406
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,410
- Overtly sexual.
- Overtly sexual.

407
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:42,530
Right. As I live and breathe. Crazy.

408
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,500
That's just crazy.

409
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,080
Okay, so listen.

410
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,580
After I let her in, you go
and try and keep my dad out.

411
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:51,040
All right? I can't let him
get in the way of this one.

412
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,170
Hey, you must be...

413
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:53,380
But first, he had to cover his tracks.

414
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,260
- What?
- This had to look like fate.

415
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,800
- George Michael?
- Huh?

416
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,930
What is this? Maeby, what are you...

417
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:01,300
doing here?

418
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:03,430
- As I live and breathe.
- But for the phrase, "as I live

419
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,180
- I thought you were the girl.
- And breathe," he nailed it.

420
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,850
I'm supposed to tutor a kid from...

421
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:09,480
High school. Yeah. That's me.

422
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,520
Crazy. That is just crazy.

423
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,480
And even though George
Michael wanted to seduce her,

424
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,400
he couldn't helpbut challenge

425
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,990
her strategy for staying in high school.

426
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:19,740
But still, I mean, you have
to make a living, right?

427
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,160
Don't you need an education?

428
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,620
Well, don't forget... I'm a Harris.

429
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,660
- Harris?
- Yeah.

430
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,830
Someone who "inharris" a lot of money.

431
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,250
Yeah, well, you know,

432
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:31,500
I wouldn't put all my Anns in that basket.

433
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,590
You know, it's fine. You don't get it.

434
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,250
You've never been a risk taker.

435
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,630
I like to with people.

436
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,130
That's what I do.

437
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,840
- I'm making a statement.
- I love it.

438
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:42,010
You know, I knew you were cool

439
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:43,220
when I saw you wearing that shirt.

440
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,100
Thanks.

441
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,310
More betrayal.

442
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,560
Oh, no, I get it, too.

443
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,230
No, I love... I love it, too.

444
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:53,400
You know, I... I love to... love now.

445
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,610
George Michael found himself

446
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,650
less overtly sexual than he'd hoped.

447
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,950
I made a 40-year-old woman cry in Spain.

448
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:02,320
I love making love to Spanish women.

449
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:04,080
Get out.

450
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,580
And George Michael slipped
back into seduction mode.

451
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:10,370
Oh, a man, a woman...

452
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:11,870
a bedroom.

453
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,840
Let's solve for "X."

454
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,130
I don't know what you're talking about.

455
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:20,970
Well, you know, in algebra,
you have an unknown element,

456
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:23,180
and, uh, we call it "X," and then you have

457
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:26,430
to solve for it to find
out what number "X" is.

458
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:28,680
"X" isn't a number.

459
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,730
So you don't even really know the basic...

460
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:32,690
But in that moment, the urge to educate her

461
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,650
was more powerful than
the urge to kiss her.

462
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:37,360
Let me show you. I'll just
show you some stuff real quick.

463
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,570
All right, so if you take
something like this... 3X+1=10...

464
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:42,320
And with the algebra lesson complete,

465
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,910
George Michael pivoted back

466
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,950
to his overtly sexual seduction.

467
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:48,080
Therefore, when I say,

468
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,500
"You and me in a bedroom,
let's solve for 'X, '" I'm...

469
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:55,170
I'm stating it as a kind of formula.

470
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:56,590
Yeah, let's get wasted.

471
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,670
Let's drink that formula.

472
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:00,590
It's not that kind of formula.

473
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,550
No, I'll show you what
a formula is real quick,

474
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:04,140
'cause that's very important.

475
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,010
- But when the door opened,
- Dad?

476
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:08,810
George Michael's window
of opportunity closed.

477
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:11,230
Bad news... P-Hound is
yanking our chain again.

478
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,890
- Uncle Michael.
- Oh, my God.

479
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:15,730
And after a brief
reunion, George Michael had

480
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:18,150
another opportunity to impress his cousin.

481
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:20,530
He's got this privacy software,

482
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:22,780
keeps people from stealing
your stuff. Tell her, pal.

483
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:25,860
So its privacy software
that's also anti-piracy?

484
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:28,740
George Michael weighed his options.

485
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:31,950
Maeby had chastised him
for not taking risks,

486
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,040
and what would be a bigger risk

487
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,870
than perpetuating a lie about software

488
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,710
just to ignite the passions of a woman?

489
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,050
Of course, it would be a lie,

490
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,340
and since Maeby wouldn't know it was a lie,

491
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,840
he wouldn't appear to be taking a risk.

492
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,140
Perhaps the bigger risk
was to tell his father

493
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,510
he was lying.

494
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,970
That he came up with it

495
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,980
because he wanted his father to leave

496
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:55,770
so he could enjoy what
remained of his senior year.

497
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:58,190
After all, he wondered, wouldn't that be

498
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:01,360
the course of action taken
by an overtly sexual man...

499
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,110
a man who owns a pair of matador pants?

500
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:08,030
He had not responded now for 41 seconds,

501
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:10,370
according to his unfailing internal clock,

502
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:13,200
and it was time to come clean.

503
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,660
Well, thanks. Yeah.

504
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,540
It's a... well, it's just a Boolean-driven

505
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:20,590
aggregation, really, of what
programmers call "hacker traps."

506
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:23,590
And he found himself
suddenly and effortlessly

507
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:26,510
tapping into a long-inbred
instinct for lying.

508
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:29,850
A Bluth taking his first steps in deceit.

509
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,890
But the more he talked,

510
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:33,770
the more he actually
started to like the idea.

511
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:35,520
So, you know, in other words, when...

512
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,400
when you have friends over,
you know, and you're...

513
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,020
you're listening to music and they want

514
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,480
to steal your music and
copy your movies or...

515
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,030
or just look at your photos,
you know, this prevents that.

516
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:47,780
It just neutralizes that so
it's not even a threat anymore.

517
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,820
It's called Fakeblock.

518
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,780
- Great name. Right?
- Yeah, well, you know,

519
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,160
it's super low-hanging fruit.

520
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,660
Someone's going to do it.

521
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,790
We're just trying to
be those guys, you know?

522
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,290
And, impressed with his

523
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:01,250
- own invention...
- It's a fake profile

524
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:03,000
that leads hackers away
from your actual data.

525
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,800
He set about making an
impossible dream a reality.

526
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,050
You mean something that keeps

527
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,470
everything on the Internet private

528
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,930
and protects everyone's digital rights?

529
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:10,220
Yeah, I mean, think about it.

530
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,550
Everyone has something

531
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,470
that they want removed from the Internet.

532
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,310
George Michael certainly did.

533
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:17,980
And if the new software served

534
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,060
no other person than removing this...

535
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,150
it would be worth it.

536
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:26,150
Ay, dios mio.

537
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,530
I mean, if we could
make something like that,

538
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:29,110
it could be bigger than Facebook.

539
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,820
I mean, who wouldn't
want something like that?

540
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,070
You think you can do it?

541
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,700
No.

542
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,200
No, of course not. No.

543
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,080
I mean, this is my chance with Maeby,

544
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,000
and I can't even get rid of my own father.

545
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,670
You know, what if we just did
a vote... just the roommates?

546
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:44,840
We do a quick vote, and
it's, "Ciao, Fathero."

547
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,130
He's going to know who voted against him.

548
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:50,800
Not if I get him to vote against himself.

549
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,140
Why would he do that?

550
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,600
No, he wouldn't. He... I...

551
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,220
I was just leaning back,
so it looked like I...

552
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,720
I got this chair again, didn't I?

553
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:00,270
Maybe I just need to be clear and just say,

554
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,810
"I'm putting up a wall.

555
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:04,150
We need to rework our whole system here."

556
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:06,820
Sounds like you guys are working
on your privacy software, huh?

557
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,650
And, long story short, Michael did end up

558
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:12,530
embracing the voting-out-a-roommate idea.

559
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:14,160
And it's, "Adios, brothiero."

560
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,580
It cannot fail.

561
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,670
That was fun.

562
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:23,000
Did he look betrayed to you?

563
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,500
He kind of always looks that way.

564
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:27,420
I'm going to catch the bus.

565
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,380
- Bye.
- Well, uh, okay. Hey, listen.

566
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,180
Are you going to come by on Thursday or...?

567
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:34,220
Um, I don't think so. I
have this thing in L.A.

568
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,850
Well, can you blow it off? I
mean, you know, you might want

569
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:37,600
to get "graduating high
school" out of the way.

570
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,520
Well, I'm getting a lifetime
achievement award at this gala.

571
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,600
Well, you might want to get that
out of the way, too, I guess.

572
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,020
Yeah.

573
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,770
Hey, you want me to go
with you to that or...?

574
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,690
Yeah, I can pick you up at your place.

575
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:51,280
Oh, they're actually
shooting a thing at my place.

576
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,200
As it turns out, they'd end up

577
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,780
- just clubbing a Thing.
- Oh!

578
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,200
You know what? Yeah, that
might actually be a good idea.

579
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,160
Because I can't bring
any of my friends without

580
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,580
getting permission
slips from their parents.

581
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,750
Well, that's not really a problem for me.

582
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:05,130
Yeah, 'cause you just
betrayed yours, right?

583
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:07,040
Awesome.

584
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,260
George Michael and Maeby arrived

585
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,340
at a hotel busy with three separate events.

586
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,180
No, no, no...

587
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:22,270
Well, it's really nice to be
out with you as adults, you know?

588
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:24,690
In Spain, they don't even
eat dinner until after 11:00 p.m.

589
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:26,690
Wow, Spain really changed you.

590
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:28,150
Well, you grow up very quickly in Spain.

591
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,820
Oh, my God, I know this guy. Hey.

592
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,110
Hey, man. Hey.

593
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:33,200
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

594
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:36,660
What are you on?

595
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,870
Oh, he's nobody.

596
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:41,700
Oh. It's Justin.

597
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,250
That's David Henrie.

598
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:44,920
He's Justin from Wizards of Waverly Place.

599
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,170
Hmm.

600
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:48,460
It's on a lot in Spain.

601
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,340
Well, I'm going to go mingle
with a bunch of 13-year-olds

602
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,630
who think they can still play fifth grade.

603
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:53,010
- Have fun.
- I'll catch up.

604
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,550
And George Michael set out

605
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:56,970
to re-unleash his overtly sexual persona.

606
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:59,890
Well, gentlemen, start your engines.

607
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:02,060
Buenas noches, pequeño Scarlet.

608
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,350
I will be needing a room, please.

609
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:05,060
How many nights?

610
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,520
Two. Sorry. No, just one night.

611
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,650
I thought you were saying how many people.

612
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:11,020
- And how many beds?
- Two.

613
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:13,240
- Two.
- No. Uh, one bed.

614
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,070
Why give her the option?
Keep it real simple.

615
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:18,070
One bed, one night, two
people, let's solve for "X."

616
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,120
I hate young Hollywood.

617
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,580
It's called Fakeblock, Mort.

618
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,970
- It's going to blow Schnoodle out of the water!
- And it was on his way back

619
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:26,580
- to Maeby that he heard her say...
- Fakeblock's the next big thing.

620
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:29,750
- It's called Fakeblock!
- What's this? You're talking... talking about Fakeblock?

621
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:32,210
- Oh. How does your privacy software work?
- Huh? It's private.

622
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,720
And that's how George
Michael not only met Rebel...

623
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,520
I don't want people to
know that I'm doing this.

624
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,930
But finally found a way to prove

625
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:41,520
to Maeby that he was a risk taker.

626
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,110
Yes. Yes. George Maharis.

627
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:46,650
Only to discover, moments later...

628
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:47,860
- Perfecto!
- ... that she was dating

629
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,820
- an even bigger risk taker.
- De nada.

630
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:53,070
That's my undercover cop boyfriend.

631
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,490
I'm trying to get him in bed.

632
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:55,910
Boyfriend?

633
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:59,450
So funny that didn't come up in the car.

634
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,620
So, how does it work?

635
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:03,960
Huh? How does what work?

636
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,750
Your privacy software.

637
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:08,380
How does it protect you from piracy?

638
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,050
Oh, I don't know.

639
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:12,340
Don't worry about it.

640
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:15,260
No, no, no. No, you
really piqued my interest.

641
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,720
I'm sorry.

642
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:20,270
And discouraged that he'd lost Maeby,

643
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:23,400
he tried to salvage his night

644
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,770
by taking a picture of Gibby from "iCarly."

645
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:28,190
As he was doing this,
however, this happened.

646
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:33,280
The explosion caused an electrical surge

647
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,740
rendering the Schnoodle
software inoperable.

648
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:38,450
Which, to those who saw him,

649
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:40,750
seemed like a genius act of cyber sabotage,

650
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:43,040
which led to this.

651
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,920
- What happened?
- Ah, it's dead.

652
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,420
That geek Maharis
destroyed the whole thing.

653
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,090
And you know why? Just because he could.

654
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:53,970
Those Internet geniuses...
that's what they do. I'm ruined.

655
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:56,260
I'll probably never get
to drive the Schnoodle car.

656
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,100
We should work together.

657
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,720
- No.
- Smart.

658
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:04,350
And a few days later,
it would lead to this.

659
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:06,690
I'm John Beard. Here's
your 15 seconds of news.

660
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:08,270
Fakeblock's mystery man, George Maharis,

661
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,530
may have just found a way to screw a cap

662
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:13,280
on the Internet, and
investors are lining up

663
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,910
to fill the company's tank with money,

664
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:16,570
even though he himself remains anonymous.

665
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:19,410
That's all the news
that's fit to pump. I quit.

666
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:21,500
By the time

667
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,460
George Michael returned tocampus,

668
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,290
even his roommate had heard
of George Maharis' Fakeblock.

669
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:27,840
This George Maharis guy stole our name,

670
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,800
but we have it registered,

671
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,590
so we can sell it to him for a fortune.

672
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:32,840
No, I am George Maharis!

673
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,300
I'm behind the whole thing.

674
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,840
I... I wanted to impress Maeby,

675
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,090
so I told her that I created
this privacy software.

676
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,760
Why would you do that?

677
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:41,470
You know, it's like the
time that you told that girl

678
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,180
that you were George Takei's son.

679
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,810
Well, it's too late.
This thing's taking off.

680
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:48,770
They're saying Fakeblock
knocked out Schnoodle.

681
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:50,610
That was a coincidence. It
must have been a power surge.

682
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:52,780
Well, we got to get something... at least

683
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,400
get our five grand back.

684
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,150
Well, I put in the five grand,
you put in three dollars.

685
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,160
Well, you may have put in
the most money to Fakeblock,

686
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,910
but I put in the first three dollars,

687
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:01,370
so that makes you a hop-on.

688
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:03,080
No, you're the hop-on, Paul,

689
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,660
and I know exactly who
you're trying to hop on to.

690
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,290
- Maeby.
- Maeby.

691
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:10,840
Yeah, well, you know
she's dating a cop, right?

692
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,340
- Yeah, she likes risk takers, like the P...
- Hi.

693
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,960
Hound...

694
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:16,220
Keep moving. Can you believe this?

695
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,130
- Maeby was excited...
- Fakeblock! It's exploding!

696
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,970
- ... but George Michael knew
- I got my PR company fanning it

697
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:21,430
the stakes were too high
for him to continue the lie.

698
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:22,600
And I even cashed in a favor

699
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,720
to get us mentioned on "Mad Money."

700
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:25,140
You know, I think we just might want

701
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:27,230
to slow down a little bit
on the whole Fakeblock thing

702
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:29,190
'cause I'm still not 100% finished with it.

703
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,560
Well, how finished are you with it?

704
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:32,820
200%? 500%

705
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,360
I also feel like I'm not 100% finished

706
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,030
- with your math tutoring.
- And then Maeby said something

707
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:39,950
- that made his change his mind.
- Do we have those books here?

708
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:41,490
I trust you, George Michael.

709
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:42,580
I would not get into bed with you

710
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,040
on this thing if I didn't trust you.

711
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,290
No. Yeah, of... of course
you can trust me in bed.

712
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:49,040
No, I mean, I trust you
not to take advantage of me.

713
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,500
No. I wouldn't. We would...
we would just lie there.

714
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:55,170
We'd just lie there? I mean,
I'm talking about business.

715
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:58,590
So am I. That's why we
would just lie there.

716
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:00,720
Okay. 'Cause I was going to say,

717
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,180
when you become an Internet billionaire,

718
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,640
you could do whatever
you want with me in bed.

719
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,680
It was that. That's what
made him change his mind.

720
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,980
- I will. I will.
- And if it was so wrong to lie,

721
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,230
surely he would receive some sort of sign.

722
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,070
Oh, hey, I should get this.

723
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:15,360
- But that wasn't it.
- Hi, Uncle Gob.

724
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,780
That was his uncle Gob wanting
to meet him at a gay club

725
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,360
- to tell him his father
- I need to see you tonight.

726
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,700
- Was anxious to see him.
- It's about your father and you.

727
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,160
Really? Is... is he upset?

728
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,870
- Do I seem like a clown to you?
- I got it.

729
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:26,450
George Michael was
worried, and even more so,

730
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:28,710
when he caught up with
his uncle at a magic club.

731
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,460
That Fakeblock thing will scrub it away.

732
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,080
You know about Fakeblock?
You know that's my software.

733
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,500
I wonder if my dad
thinks I'm blowing him off

734
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,590
because that's starting to take off now.

735
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:38,510
Well, you should go
find out 'cause I do know

736
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:40,800
that your dad is really,
really, really upset with you.

737
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,590
He is upset? I asked you that.

738
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,760
That was literally the
first thing I asked you.

739
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:46,810
So you're giving me these crazy...

740
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:48,270
Mad?

741
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:50,310
So, it was a very shaken George Michael

742
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:52,900
who arrived later at the Ealing Club...

743
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,440
What do you mean, I'm already
up there? Obviously, I'm not...

744
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,190
as a frustrated Andy
Richter was having trouble

745
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:57,900
already up there because I'm here.

746
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,440
Getting into the club he was a member of.

747
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:01,860
It's my stupid brother!
He looks just like me.

748
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:04,490
I'll just go up, I'll find
him, I'll... Oh, come on.

749
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:05,830
Oh, hey, Donny!

750
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:07,200
Hey, I had you for a semester at Openings.

751
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,620
Yeah, okay, all right.

752
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,330
Hey, come. I'm... I'm his guest.

753
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:11,790
Is this man your guest?

754
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,580
Oh, no, no. I'm just meeting my dad here.

755
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:15,000
Oh, screw this. I'm going up.

756
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,630
- Oh, come on.
- Going up, going up.

757
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:18,590
Oh, come on!

758
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:20,380
Oh, some Openings child you are, man!

759
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,930
And George Michael girded himself

760
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:25,510
for his first meeting with his father

761
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:27,430
since he voted him out of the dorm.

762
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:29,060
Hi. Yeah, just a sea-breeze, please.

763
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,680
Make it a strong one.

764
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:32,100
Put some stank on that.

765
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,600
George?

766
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:35,610
George Maharis?

767
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:37,440
And that's when he heard

768
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,900
the name he'd forgotten
he'd given out as his own.

769
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:43,450
So he tried not to act surprised to hear it

770
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:44,870
when he saw it was Rebel.

771
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:46,280
I see you.

772
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,120
Unfortunately, that meant being stuck

773
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,700
affecting a blasé attitude.

774
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,250
Rebel Alley?

775
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:52,580
We spoke three days ago.

776
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,620
I know, I know. I remember.

777
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:57,040
- Are you a member here?
- No, I'm not.

778
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:59,130
No, I just walked in past
the big black security guard.

779
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:00,590
All of which now worked against him.

780
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:02,300
Okay, you know what?

781
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,130
I was trying to be nice,
but you're just a jerk.

782
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:06,640
You're a bigger jerk than
Andy Richter over there!

783
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,060
Loosen up, bitch.

784
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,600
I'm Andy Richter!

785
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:13,390
I probably make, like,
$8,000 a day or something.

786
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:15,560
Hey, I'm... I'm sorry. I... I...

787
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,020
You know, I'm in the
middle of a whole thing

788
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,940
with my dad right now, and I, um...

789
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:22,900
I didn't mean to be...
however I just came off.

790
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,070
Badly.

791
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,530
Well, I'm sorry, you know.

792
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:27,620
I've never met a beautiful actress before.

793
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,870
Oh, so you do know who I am?

794
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,450
God, of course I know who you are!

795
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:32,450
You were in the remake
of "Dangerous Cousins."

796
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,540
I signed up to Netflix
because of that movie.

797
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,170
Uh-huh.

798
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:38,500
I think I was thrown that you
were interested in who I am.

799
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,090
Well, you are George Maharis.

800
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:42,340
- Everyone's talking about your software company.
- Oh, yeah.

801
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:46,010
I'm sure women are just
throwing themselves at your feet.

802
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:49,510
Well, you know, I, uh... I
prefer a woman who aims higher.

803
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,850
- That was funny.
- Yeah, I know.

804
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:56,190
- That was good. That was...
- Smooth.

805
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:58,480
Smooth. Hey, we have
the same taste in words.

806
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,900
Okay, should we get a drink? I'm buying.

807
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,690
I don't want you to think
I'm after you for your money.

808
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,150
George Michael was
thrown by what was clearly

809
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,400
Rebel's stated interest in him.

810
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:07,950
George Michael? George Michael?

811
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:09,410
Which is perhaps why he ignored the page...

812
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:10,870
- George Michael?
- ... that he assumed

813
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:12,910
- was from his father.
- George Michael?

814
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:16,410
Is George Michael here?
Is George Michael here?

815
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,870
Oh, God.

816
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,250
Just remind me not to go in the men's room!

817
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:22,840
Uh, would you excuse me?

818
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,420
I... I'm just gonna use the men's room.

819
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,550
- Okay.
- And while checking

820
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,220
his messages, he got some good news.

821
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,550
Hey, buddy, it's Dad. Um, I am having

822
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,180
real trouble getting up there.

823
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,470
Uh, this traffic is unbelievable.

824
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,770
We got a light aircraft right
in the middle of the freeway.

825
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:40,270
Call me back when you get this?

826
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:43,690
But while Michael was
leaving a second message,

827
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:45,070
George Michael left one for him.

828
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:47,320
Oh. Hey, hang on. This is you.

829
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,240
Hey, it's me. You know what?

830
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,740
I bet we're sitting in the exact
same traffic; this is a mess.

831
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,490
Now hoping to ensure

832
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:55,250
that his father didn't
make it to their meeting.

833
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:56,830
Maybe that's better. Oh,
God, they're forcing us off.

834
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:58,290
Oh, God, they're forcing us off,

835
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,790
but you know, we can
just do this another time

836
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:02,130
if that works. Maybe that's better.

837
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:04,750
Oh, they're closing the
lanes. Oh, this is beautiful.

838
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,050
Same traffic. Unreal.

839
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:10,180
Unreal. Kind of looking around for you now.

840
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:12,140
Maybe you're right near me.

841
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,720
Anyhow, if you get this,

842
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,480
maybe we will just meet... somewhere else.

843
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,060
Gonna hang up now.

844
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,230
I'm going to video this
and send it in to the news.

845
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:22,900
Glad you're getting some footage of this,

846
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,650
'cause I can't really
get a good angle myself.

847
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:26,990
They're forcing us off here
like a bunch of animals.

848
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:29,070
You know, maybe we'll do this
another time, 'cause this is...

849
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,950
It's sad to say, but it's left me...

850
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:32,530
animals. You know maybe
we'll do this another time.

851
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:33,870
It's sad to say,

852
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:35,290
but it's left me pretty shaken up.

853
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:37,620
God, I just hope there
are no kids on that plane.

854
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,410
'Cause, you know, they don't
have any choice in the matter.

855
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,460
Well, I'll tell you what.

856
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,040
I feel worse for the parents, okay?

857
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,540
Probably the kids thought

858
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:46,590
that they could fly the
plane all by themselves.

859
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:49,800
Bet you 500 bucks they find
a dead kid behind the stick.

860
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,720
You know, or maybe on the dead dad's lap

861
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,060
whose only fault was
loving that kid too much

862
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,510
and letting him fly the plane.

863
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,430
Next thing he knows,
he's bouncing of the top

864
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:00,430
of the Sports Chalet onto
the express lane of the 605.

865
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,310
- I'll bet you 500 bucks.
- Michael was hurt

866
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:05,610
- and on his way out...
- See you. I'm out of your hair.

867
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:07,440
When he heard something
that cheered him up.

868
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,400
The guy that was harassing
Rebel... he's on his way down.

869
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,990
Say, Rebel?

870
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:13,280
Hey, Andy Richter.

871
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,990
Michael Bluth. How you doing, Andy?

872
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:16,740
Oh, yeah. I... I'm Andy.

873
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:19,330
So, I know him. Can I
get on your membership,

874
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:21,080
- and can you vouch for me? Okay?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

875
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,290
Whatever you want... it's on Andy.

876
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:23,670
Thank you.

877
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:25,250
It's on this rich hole.

878
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:26,710
Bye.

879
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:28,550
But before Michael could find Rebel,

880
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:31,090
he ran into the man, that at that point,

881
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:33,180
he still thought was her lover.

882
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,470
Ron!

883
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:36,800
- Hey.
- No, no. It's Michael.

884
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:40,060
Michael Bluth... doing the
film about my family and...

885
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,140
Yeah, when are we gonna get
your kid's signature, though?

886
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:43,480
- Yeah, I'm working on it.
- Oh.

887
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,810
- And I... I got a hold of him.
- Oh, oh.

888
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:46,230
And we're gonna meet here tonight,

889
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,650
but I think that he's blowing me off.

890
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:50,150
Well, yeah, kids will be kids, right?

891
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:52,360
Well, you know, a month
ago, I would have told you

892
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,780
that he and I were exactly
the same, that we were twins.

893
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:59,580
But now, I wouldn't even
think of my son as my brother.

894
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,830
You know, the thing is...

895
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:04,370
He's busy.

896
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,710
George Michael finds himself the subject

897
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,720
of a lawsuit over the ownership

898
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,720
- of Fakeblock.
- Could you put in a good word

899
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,220
on the missing Lucille 2 case?

900
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,550
That's a career maker.

901
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,640
That's an O.J.

902
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,220
You just need one of those. Huh?

903
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:23,600
Uh, excuse me, uh, but was
it or was it not my client

904
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,850
who put up the initial seed
money for the block software

905
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:30,070
that served as the underlying
architecture of Fakeblock?

906
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:32,740
- It was 99 cents.
- Times three.
- Times three.

907
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,360
Times three.

908
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:39,530
Can I say something to my client?

909
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,830
Take to the sea!
