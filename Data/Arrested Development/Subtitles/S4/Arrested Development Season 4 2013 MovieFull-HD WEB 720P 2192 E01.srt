1
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,330
It was May...

2
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:13,920
It was May 4,

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,670
and in the bayside town
of Newport Beach,

4
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,130
the annual celebration

5
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:21,050
known as Cinco de Cuatro
was underway.

6
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:25,490
The holiday started as
a particularly vicious response

7
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,660
by a young Lucille Bluth
to the Mexican holiday...

8
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,000
- This still isn't made?
- ...of Cinco de Mayo.

9
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,210
- No, no, it's not.
- Rosa, why is this still a mess?!

10
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,510
She said it's, uh,
it's Cinco de Mayo.

11
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:37,750
She's taking, uh, the day off.

12
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:39,520
- She said that?
- Yeah.

13
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,020
- She called it Cinco de Mayo?
- She did, yeah.

14
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,730
Oh, why can't they
just call it May 5?

15
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,150
This is what
I was talking about.

16
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:46,740
It's all part
of the Mexican war on May 5.

17
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,460
- War on May 5, I know, yeah. It is.
- It is.

18
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:50,580
But even a skeptical George Sr.

19
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:53,040
soon found himself feeling
similarly embattled.

20
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,710
Where the  are my socks?!

21
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,790
Now it's not so funny, is it?

22
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:58,790
No, not funny.

23
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,710
We should start our own holiday.

24
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,970
You see, the Hispanics
of Newport liked Cinco a lot,

25
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:07,510
but high up on Coast Highway,
Lucille Bluth did not.

26
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,480
Doesn't look like they'll be
done any time soon.

27
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,110
And then Lucille had
a horrible thought,

28
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:16,610
a thought that was thoughtless
and better to not.

29
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,030
"What if," she thought
with a sneering grin...

30
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:24,000
Next year what if the party
didn't even begin?

31
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,920
And so began
a holiday on the eve

32
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,840
- of the fifth of May...
- ♪ The cockroach... ♪

33
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,010
...originally intended
to deplete the party supplies

34
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,590
the Cinco de Mayo celebrants
were relying upon.

35
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,260
Fill the bay with chorizo.

36
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,770
- Chorizo dump!
- Over 30 years, however, it grew

37
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,270
and was soon embraced
by the Hispanic community...

38
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,650
You buy it, you break it!

39
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:43,690
...for financial reasons...

40
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:46,480
and as the celebrations peaked

41
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,070
with a boat parade
called the Festival of Lights--

42
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,830
another phrase
they wanted back--

43
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:55,330
one man was about
to hit his lowest point.

44
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:00,960
♪ On the sixth of May... ♪

45
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,220
Happy Cuatro, happy Cuatro!

46
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,590
Let's throw
some more taco shells.

47
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,640
Olé!

48
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,010
Sally, can I...?

49
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,810
I need to speak
to Lucille 2, please.

50
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:13,810
It's okay, Sally,
I'll talk to Michael.

51
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,230
This is Lucille 2,

52
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,280
a longtime patron
of the Bluth family.

53
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,200
I'll be downstairs
kicking myself

54
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,530
for not marrying you
so many years ago.

55
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,290
Michael, do you have
something for me?

56
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:26,750
Does bad news count?

57
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,120
There's that Bluth wit.

58
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:30,040
Oh, I love your family.

59
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,630
She certainly
had demonstrated that

60
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,760
with many of the men
in the family...

61
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,840
Oh, stop it,
you're making me dizzy.

62
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,310
...even having fallen
for a few,

63
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:41,560
although some of that was
the vertigo she suffered from.

64
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,900
But not all of it.

65
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,820
- Dad?
- No, no.

66
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,900
But seriously, she had gotten
intimate with Buster and Gob.

67
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,030
I need that money I lent you.

68
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,120
I am in the middle of a campaign

69
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,990
and I am desperate
for the ad money.

70
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,080
You're going to get it.

71
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,960
I just need an extension.

72
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,040
Why don't you go to your family?

73
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,920
I don't need them.

74
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,290
What I need is you.

75
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,760
What are you suggesting?

76
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,730
No.

77
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:17,980
Okay, that was nasty.

78
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,570
Aren't you sweet?

79
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:20,950
- Thank you.
- Okay.

80
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,080
Don't tilt your head, okay?

81
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,660
And that's
when Michael debased himself.

82
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,830
What are you doing?

83
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,250
I'm gonna have sex
with you for money.

84
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,180
Later that night,

85
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:40,220
after Michael did
something unthinkable,

86
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,890
he was looking
for a place to hide

87
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,900
and he returned
to a long neglected model home

88
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,690
he believed to be empty.

89
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,280
Thanks for coming

90
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,410
so late, Maria, I know
that you won't be cleaning up

91
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,830
tomorrow, and we did make
quite a mess of that bedroom.

92
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,660
Michael.

93
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,830
This is Michael's brother Gob.

94
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,630
Neither had expected
to see each other

95
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,750
after some recent
unpleasantness.

96
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,300
I didn't expect
to be seeing you again

97
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,680
after all the unpleasantness.

98
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,390
I-I've, I've,
I've been out of control.

99
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,020
Sorry.

100
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,430
In fact, I-I just did something
that I-I don't,

101
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,440
I don't, I don't know
why I did it.

102
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,810
Do you want to talk about it?

103
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,980
No, I do not,
I've said too much already.

104
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,150
You cannot help me.

105
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,150
Well, I wasn't hoping to help.

106
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,400
I was hoping to rub it in

107
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,280
because of all
the unpleasantness.

108
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,780
- Got it. - Oh, damn it, I meant
to throw these in the chipper.

109
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,370
God, I'm just not
into Cuatro this year.

110
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,250
I was the one that was wrong,
not you,

111
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:32,340
and besides, you could not
make me feel worse right now.

112
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,710
Well, I'd be willing

113
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,050
to let you have
your apology back

114
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:36,470
if you give me
the chance to try.

115
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,950
I mean, I'm gonna need
some specifics

116
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,390
about the thing
that you're ashamed of.

117
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,810
Otherwise I'll just be
taking general potshots.

118
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:47,730
Bad example: if you were ashamed
of being in love with a man,

119
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,980
suddenly discovered
these new feelings,

120
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:52,490
then I might say something like,
"Homo much?"

121
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:53,860
- It's not that.
- I said "Bad example."

122
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,280
I went to go see Lucille 2

123
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:58,750
and I just, I just--
I lost control.

124
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,540
I did something
that I wish I could forget.

125
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,380
You have got no idea how I feel.

126
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,090
Well, if you're talking about
doing something embarrassing

127
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,710
with a woman, then no, I don't.

128
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,220
But he should have.

129
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,090
It's almost
as if he found a way

130
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:12,350
to simulate amnesia.

131
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,430
Hey, I'm down
to my last Forget-Me-Now.

132
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,810
In fact,
that is what he had done.

133
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,480
Hey, remember me?

134
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:21,240
Gob had always taken a pill

135
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,740
he called a Forget-Me-Now
for that...

136
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,410
- No más.
- ¿No más?

137
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,870
...but was commonly known
as a roofie.

138
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:27,870
There's only one left.

139
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,370
How could that possibly be?

140
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:30,420
Unless... John Beard Jr.

141
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,130
I don't need to get into it.

142
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,920
I came here because I thought
the house was empty,

143
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,800
but I can go
somewhere else, okay?

144
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,430
- Hey, listen, Michael, if you
want, we can split this. - No,

145
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,340
I feel like this is something
that I shouldn't forget,

146
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,220
okay, and believe me,
this is the last time

147
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,350
I ever judge you for anything

148
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,350
that you ever do.

149
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,190
Oh,.

150
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:49,570
Is that who you were with?

151
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,440
I knew it, I always knew it.

152
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,070
- Take this, Michael, forget, forget.
- No, no, no, no, no.

153
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,410
Put the mask back on.
Forget this, Michael.

154
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,580
- Forget, forget, Michael.
- Gob.

155
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,040
Forget, now is the time
to forget.

156
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,290
Now you're forgetting.

157
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,000
- Now you're forgetting.
- God.

158
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,540
♪ It's so easy to forget... ♪

159
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,920
♪ It's so easy to forget. ♪

160
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:10,550
Stupid, forgetful Michael.

161
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,510
Now, the story of a family

162
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,270
whose future was abruptly
canceled and the one son

163
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,360
who had no choice
but to keep himself together.

164
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,490
It's Michael's...

165
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:31,120
Six months
before the Forget-Me-Now,

166
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,170
Michael had made good
on a long-standing threat

167
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:34,960
to go to Phoenix,

168
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,090
and even though the Phoenix
he went to was online,

169
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:41,930
he still enjoyed
the full college experience

170
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:44,890
by living in a dorm room
while doing so.

171
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:47,400
George Michael, what is
my log-on password again?

172
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,480
Unfortunately
it was his son's dorm room

173
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,270
at the University of California
at Irvine.

174
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,950
Dad, come on, what have we said
is the most important thing?

175
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,450
I have tried "family."

176
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:59,040
- It does not work for me.
- No, privacy.

177
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,290
This is Michael's son

178
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:04,000
George Michael-- a nice kid.

179
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,460
Uh, no one should have
your password but you.

180
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,010
I shouldn't even know it.

181
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:09,930
- You've made that point.
- Have I?

182
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:12,050
My point is, we have
no secrets from each other.

183
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,560
We know everything there is
to know about each other.

184
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,560
We're like twins.

185
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,560
I don't see us as twins.

186
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,440
Yeah? You name me one way
in which we're different.

187
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,360
I think you tend to be better

188
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,650
at feeling
like you belong places.

189
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,700
Do I?

190
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,210
I want you to start feeling
like you belong places.

191
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,330
Look at that guy.

192
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,540
He thinks he's a musician.

193
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,230
You know, like,
you've got to start having

194
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,510
a little bit better sense
of humor about yourself.

195
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:41,510
Look at me.

196
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,720
People say I don't age.

197
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,310
You know, like,
"Hey, look at that guy.

198
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:46,100
He's got the hair
of a teenager."

199
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,480
And I say, "Take your best shot"

200
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,350
because I think
that that's a good thing

201
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,070
because I'm self-effacing.

202
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,320
Hmm?

203
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,740
I want you to be able
to do that.

204
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,570
Well, it's hard
to be self-effacing

205
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:00,290
when you're a perfect specimen
of rugged manlessness.

206
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,330
Well, you can't hear this, but,

207
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:05,920
but we're gonna work on it.

208
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,590
That's why I'm living
in your dorm.

209
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,030
Well, I thought
you were living here

210
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,630
because you had
nowhere else to go.

211
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:13,090
Yeah, and because of the fact
you had this big double room

212
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,350
all to yourself
because of your name.

213
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:16,180
The name George Michael

214
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,980
did create confusion
in the campus housing office.

215
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,480
This guy's name is actually
George Michael.

216
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,650
No, it's two different guys.

217
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:24,440
They're twins, ugly.

218
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:26,400
We should sign them up
for Twin Club.

219
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:29,490
And let's give them
the big handicap room.

220
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:31,160
Yeah, you see,
that's the other thing, is that

221
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,290
I kind of wanted to use
this time to almost kind of,

222
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:36,000
you know, wean off
of the name George Michael.

223
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,630
What?

224
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:41,380
I don't know, you know,
you get older, you do

225
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,720
a something search
of your own name...

226
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,640
In George Michael's
case, you find this.

227
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,690
It was in this men's room in--
get this-- Beverly Hills

228
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,110
that singer George Michael
was arrested

229
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:54,230
for soliciting sex
from an undercover cop.

230
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,240
Well, it was your mother's idea
to call you George Michael,

231
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,410
you know, and I think
it was just

232
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,080
so that we didn't confuse you

233
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,330
with your Uncle George or
your Grandfather George.

234
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:05,000
- Right.
- I got it, let's call you Boy George.

235
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,000
Singer Boy George

236
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,000
in the news again today,

237
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,090
this time for sexual assault

238
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,090
in a men's public bathroom.

239
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:11,340
Beatrix Hebberly-Sneed,
Wee BBC 2.

240
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,180
You know, I think

241
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,350
I'll, I'll just--
I'll stick with George Michael.

242
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,180
I mean, at least
it was consensual.

243
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,350
But I guess the, uh,
the bigger point

244
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,560
I'm making is just that,
uh, it's hard to have

245
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:23,400
any privacy
now that they've stuck me

246
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,650
- with an actual roommate.
- Well, you know, listen,

247
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,070
I'm all for kicking P-Hound out,
you know that.

248
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,280
Well, you know, I didn't
really mean privacy from him.

249
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,330
I know, I know, I know.

250
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:37,130
You want your space from me?

251
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,630
Um, look,

252
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:42,420
listen, hey, hey,
look, look, listen.

253
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,550
Listen, look it.

254
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:47,390
Are you listening?
You want your space.

255
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,680
I get it.

256
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:52,150
I did not mean
to crowd you, pal.

257
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:55,190
Listen, I thought that this was,
that this was fun, and,

258
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:57,320
- and it is okay if you didn't
see it that way. - Oh, Dad.

259
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,360
Buddy, it's not like
I don't have someplace to go.

260
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:01,530
You know, I'll just go
right back to the model home.

261
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,330
They don't have Internet there,
so I'll just put

262
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,210
the law school on, on, on pause.

263
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,830
It's not like the first time
that I've done that.

264
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,880
You know, last time I did that,
you were born. You know what?

265
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,550
Screw it, maybe I'll just go
to the real Phoenix

266
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,170
and finish school.

267
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,470
They got one in Costa Mesa.

268
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,260
Plus they want me
for an article.

269
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,640
Media wants to talk
to Daddy about the real

270
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,220
estate business,
and once they do that,

271
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,930
I'm gonna be right back on top.

272
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,440
You know what?
This is your school rally shirt.

273
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,310
You know, same size--medium.

274
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,270
Do you know where mine is? We
wear the same size like twi...

275
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,650
We're just like twin--
couple of identical...

276
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,360
Dad, Dad, no, I...

277
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:32,870
Look, I was not talking
about privacy from you per se.

278
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:37,370
I was talking about my software.

279
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,840
What's that?

280
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,460
It's privacy software.

281
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,880
That's why the word came up.

282
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,630
It's not why the word came up.

283
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,600
But George Michael
was writing code

284
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,430
for a block software

285
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:50,930
with his roommate
that was proving challenging.

286
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,400
...you're leaving a hole

287
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,980
just right in the middle
of the block.

288
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,320
Both because of online threats
to his privacy...

289
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,280
Otherwise, people will be
able to hack in through

290
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,410
a mobile platform portal, and
it won't be a block anything 3G.

291
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,620
...and some in-room threats
to his privacy, as well.

292
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,580
Buddy, is that schoolwork?

293
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,910
No, we're just right
in the middle of this software.

294
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,710
Great, good.
Give me the lappy.

295
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,540
I'll hit save for you.
I got to Skype with my advisor

296
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:11,420
in Phoenix, and if I don't
get on right now,

297
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:15,760
he's gonna have to Skype me
from a T.G.I. Friday's.

298
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,760
- Oh.
- Yeah.

299
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,310
Whew.

300
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,640
'Cause that hurt for a second.

301
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,310
I was like, he wants me to go.

302
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:24,350
- No, no, no, no, no.
- But no. Yeah? No.

303
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,520
- Software.
- No.

304
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:26,730
I mean, yeah, I may need

305
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,860
some privacy, you know,
to work on it,

306
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:33,490
and that might mean...
you going.

307
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:37,960
Oh, you mean here.

308
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,630
Yeah, clearing out.

309
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,340
An hour, here, there. Yes?

310
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,670
Got it. Not a problem.
You give me a little

311
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,720
fair warning,
I clear right out of here.

312
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,510
Let's schedule it now.
We can do it.

313
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:48,010
I need help with
the calendar though.

314
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:50,640
It's, like, stuck on 2003.

315
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,640
- Help me just break into...
- You just hit "today."

316
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,350
- The "today" button.
- Sorry. It's stuck in 2003,

317
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,520
so I don't have "today."

318
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,570
I need to jump forward...

319
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:58,030
No, I know, there's a button

320
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,740
- that says "today."
- Yeah, this has no button.

321
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:00,910
Anyway, you know,
I'm just gonna run downstairs

322
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:01,820
and, uh, grab a bite.

323
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,990
Wait, I want to go.

324
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,830
Let me go. I'll go. I'm hungry.

325
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,830
Come on.

326
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,750
Michael Bluth
was fitting right in

327
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,420
with his son's
college experience.

328
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,050
Be good for you, huh?

329
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:18,140
Gettable, right?

330
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,810
Hey, tell me about
the software thing.

331
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:21,390
This is the Faceblock thing
you were working on?

332
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,390
Is it like Facebook?

333
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:24,140
Uh, well, no.

334
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,770
It's kind of the opposite
of Facebook, you know.

335
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,770
Facebook connects you
with everyone,

336
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,940
this blocks you from everyone.

337
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:32,320
Oh, okay. Kind of like
the antisocial network, right?

338
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,990
- That's very good.
- You can use it.

339
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,540
I don't understand
the Internet stuff.

340
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,960
You give me all the parts
and you tell me to build

341
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,210
a television set, I can
bang that out, but I, you know,

342
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,290
I can't get the right day
to display on my calendar.

343
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,260
- Just press "today."
- Yeah, just tried that.

344
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,050
Doesn't work on mine, pal.

345
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:47,970
This is very, very, very
exciting, you know,

346
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:51,060
because once they come out
with that article on me

347
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,980
in that in-flight magazine,

348
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,190
now, the family's gonna be
right back on top.

349
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:57,400
- The guy's doing a whole spread on me.
- In-flight magazine?

350
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,980
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
It's called Altitude.

351
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,190
It's for OutWest Airlines.

352
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,360
Next to SkyMall, it's, like,

353
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,030
the number two most read
in all of coach.

354
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,490
Well, three with
the safety card,

355
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:07,200
but get a lot of attention
for Sudden Valley.

356
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,250
And then with your Internet
company, it's gonna be like--

357
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:11,250
we're gonna have two businesses,
you know?

358
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,960
And yours sounds like
such a natural.

359
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,090
I mean, no one likes
to share their identity.

360
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,300
- Right?
- Well...

361
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,430
Okay, give me
your meal plan card.

362
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,050
I'm gonna run in there,

363
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,350
I'm gonna grab a tray,
you run around back,

364
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,350
make sure you get there in time,

365
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,470
before my hand stamp dries.

366
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,480
Okay?

367
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,440
Here we go.

368
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,480
Michael had a right
to be excited.

369
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,900
It had been many years
since the Bluth family

370
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,860
had had any business success.

371
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:36,120
Not since Michael's mother
Lucille had sold off a quarter

372
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,330
of the company just before the
onset of the great dark period.

373
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:41,580
But after examining
the company's prospects...

374
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:44,460
Are those police boats?

375
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,220
Lucille 2.

376
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,880
...Stan Sitwell
quickly divested himself.

377
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:50,510
How'd you like to be bumped up
to Lucille 1?

378
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:52,470
So the Bluth family
had a new stakeholder,

379
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,310
while the old one,
who knew she'd be implicated

380
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,110
in some of
the family's misdeeds...

381
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,070
You boys know
how to shovel coal?

382
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,950
...headed out on whatever the
opposite of a maiden voyage is.

383
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,410
Michael, however, made a pledge

384
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:08,120
not to get pulled
into the drama

385
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,250
and to let the family
keep themselves all together,

386
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:13,000
- for a while.
- ...for a while.

387
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,010
And he set off to sea, even as

388
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:17,380
his mother mysteriously
turned back.

389
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:20,260
Why the alleged ship-jacker
changed direction

390
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,890
is still unexplained.

391
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:24,310
But what is known
is that many of the charges

392
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,940
against this seaward matriarch
will fall under

393
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,570
the dominion of the little
understood maritime law.

394
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,950
And soon,
the hearing drew near...

395
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:34,410
Well, I missed the hearing.

396
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,120
...and then passed.

397
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,990
Oh, it just snuck up on me,
and then they called,

398
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,710
and they wanted me there
at eight bells.

399
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,250
You know, I thought
that was their 5:00 p.m.

400
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:44,380
By the time I got back,
the courtroom was

401
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,340
reverted back
to the crab restaurant.

402
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,010
"Eight bells" refers
to a watch length.

403
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,340
It's maritime law.

404
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,430
Yes, Michael returned
after all.

405
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,390
You know, one bell is struck
after 30 minutes, two bells...

406
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:54,730
It seems Michael
had been interested

407
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:57,480
in maritime law
since playing a lawyer

408
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,400
in an original school play

409
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,030
titled The Trial
of Captain Hook.

410
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,610
♪ You're a crook,
Captain Hook... ♪

411
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,450
Prior to this,
his only dream had been

412
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:06,950
to possess the power of flight.

413
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:09,410
But that one turned out to be

414
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,960
not as much fun as he thought.

415
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,210
Watch out for the seal!

416
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,050
Loose seal! Loose seal!

417
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:18,010
I'm watching!

418
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,430
You're out of the play!

419
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:24,390
That's why, at sea, a watch with
no incidents is described as

420
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:25,730
"eight bells and all is well."

421
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:28,230
Wow, maybe you should be
the maritime lawyer.

422
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,310
This is what I've been saying.

423
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,650
Because I did go to law school

424
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,110
with an emphasis
on maritime law.

425
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:34,110
Oh, your one year of law school

426
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:36,030
is going to beat Barry's three?

427
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:37,620
It's ridiculous.

428
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,700
We'll hire the best.

429
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,700
And who's gonna pay

430
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,210
for the best, Mom?

431
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,500
We have money from
selling some shares.

432
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,460
Plus, we got
that stimulus package.

433
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,710
What are you talking about?

434
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,380
That money is spent.

435
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:50,510
I just bought 4,000 acres
of California desert.

436
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,510
Time-out.

437
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,050
Hang on.

438
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,720
- What's this?
- Yeah.

439
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:57,770
I'm gonna be moving there
for a little while.

440
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:00,520
Old big bear's not gonna be
around much anymore.

441
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:02,530
- I don't care about that.
- He's in denial.

442
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:04,030
- We're getting divorced!
- Your mother and I

443
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:05,030
are getting a divorce.

444
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,370
I want to know...

445
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:18,130
I want to know about
the stimulus package.

446
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:21,050
You couldn't use any of that
money to finish Sudden Valley?

447
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,720
You don't consider
that finished?

448
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,680
So the family got
a little stimmy.

449
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,520
Don't make a federal case
out of it.

450
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,110
That is exactly what they're
going to make out of it.

451
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,690
And when you say "family,"
you mean our family?

452
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:33,070
They've already got
their hooks in it?

453
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,400
Buster, no offense.

454
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,400
None taken.

455
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:36,860
Oh, I keep losing my jewels.

456
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:39,280
Michael, you never
accept help from anyone.

457
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,370
That's why we didn't cut you in.

458
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:42,790
We didn't want to demean you.

459
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:45,210
It's like tipping
an African-American.

460
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,630
You wouldn't tip
an African-American, would you?

461
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,630
Of course I would.

462
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,800
On a train?

463
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,260
What...

464
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,220
Did you know about all this?

465
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,560
No, I've been tipping them.

466
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,890
Even a waiter?

467
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,810
Okay, the treadmill's
up and running.

468
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:03,110
We got the door on,
and we were able

469
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:05,320
to match the faux on the paint.

470
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:11,870
Thank you so much
for your hard work.

471
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,250
So long.

472
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:22,260
Michael, we can't
give you that money.

473
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,760
We got to keep you clean.

474
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,510
You're the key witness
in your mother's trial.

475
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,640
Let me get this straight.

476
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,520
I still have to do all the work

477
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,360
as the president of the company,
but I can't use any of the money

478
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,610
for the company, and you won't
let me help with your case,

479
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:35,780
but you'd still like for me
to testify at your trial.

480
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,360
Is that right?

481
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,910
I just want you to say
I was a loving mother.

482
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,290
And now perjury.

483
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:42,620
Hey, it wasn't easy to get

484
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,960
Lucille 2 to keep you on
as president.

485
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,540
- I'll be sure to thank her.
- Don't thank her.

486
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:49,710
She doesn't have
enough shares to stop us.

487
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,670
Hmm.

488
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,720
And that's how Michael
found a way

489
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,720
to finish
Sudden Valley himself.

490
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,270
- Hello.
- Hello.

491
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:01,440
He simply traded his shares of
the Bluth company to Lucille 2.

492
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,150
I hold on to Sudden Valley;
it's like a pet project...

493
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,570
- Getting himself out,
- Thank you so much.

494
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:06,610
and giving the balance of power

495
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:09,740
to a woman who had
no power of balance.

496
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,200
Oh.

497
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:16,250
And for the first time,
he didn't feel he needed

498
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:19,710
to tell his family
he was done with them.

499
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,260
But he did anyway.

500
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,590
You know what,
I am done with this family.

501
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:25,220
I hope you've saved some money,

502
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,310
'cause you're gonna need
every dime now.

503
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,560
What's this?

504
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,310
And with his newfound wealth,

505
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,650
Michael was not only able
to send his son off

506
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:35,820
- Get out of here!
- to a bright future

507
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:38,450
in college,
with the family car...

508
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,950
...he was also able to finish

509
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:45,580
the long-delayed housing
development Sudden Valley,

510
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:50,670
but this time,
under his own company name.

511
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,300
Maybe I can give you a tip.

512
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,930
Might want to put a road
up to this place.

513
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,600
Well, we paved the neighborhood.

514
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,600
Just waiting for the city
to build a road to it.

515
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,810
And although his mother's
day in court was something

516
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:03,980
both he and his college-bound
son would miss,

517
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,530
Michael truly felt
that nothing could go wrong.

518
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:08,910
And then something did.

519
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,910
Not that.
That happens all the time.

520
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,500
This.

521
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,960
The collapse of the California
housing market

522
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,420
is taking a personal toll with
cutbacks here at the station.

523
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,800
And since the main Internet
and information cable

524
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,510
had been severed when the
community pool was installed,

525
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:29,850
Michael suddenly found himself
living in a ghost town

526
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,890
he himself built.

527
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,320
Well, that's not a great sign.

528
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:54,510
This is why you don't
confide in a competitor.

529
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,930
Michael was desperate to cover

530
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:00,680
his copious building costs...

531
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:01,890
Just till I get on my feet.

532
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,600
...so he returned to a woman

533
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:05,940
he could count on
to put off his downfall.

534
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,780
- I got you!
- Just as he could count on

535
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,820
her putting him off
and falling down.

536
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,240
You did. Bye-bye.

537
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,620
Oop.

538
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,870
That's a hot mess.

539
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,620
But weeks
stretched into months,

540
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,120
and the situation got bleaker.

541
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:24,010
And it was either this
that made him lose hope...

542
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,220
Love each other.

543
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,060
Pete! Pete!

544
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,940
...or possibly it was
the death of that mailman...

545
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:33,980
Wait here.

546
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,270
Hang on, Pete!

547
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,270
...but Michael finally gave up.

548
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,690
I got one bar!

549
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:39,360
And having alienated

550
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,990
everyone else in the family,

551
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:43,160
turned to the one person
he had left.

552
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,830
I thought we'd have Thanksgiving
here for your senior year.

553
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,380
I don't have a kitchen.

554
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,420
Oh, these are my clothes.

555
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,050
Pete died.

556
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:56,970
God.

557
00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:01,020
And so Michael moved into
his son's college dorm room.

558
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,310
You are kidding me.

559
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,860
They're gonna be
in seat backs today?

560
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:06,900
That is great news.

561
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,780
Which, in the new economy,

562
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,820
wasn't as unusual a phenomenon
as you might think.

563
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,780
Don't go through my stuff,
Granddad.

564
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,240
Hey, who do you think
paid for your stuff?

565
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:17,250
Excuse me. Sorry. Do you know
where George Michael is?

566
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:18,870
Um, he's in the computer lab.

567
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,380
Great.

568
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,420
- There's a computer lab?
- There's a computer lab?

569
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,420
Huh.

570
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,170
I'm putting up a wall.

571
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,760
We need to rework
our whole system here.

572
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,680
Sounds like you guys are working
on your privacy software, huh?

573
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,970
Hey. How'd you find me?

574
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,930
Uh, Trang's grandfather.

575
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:35,980
Boy, shoot me if I'm 86, living
in my grandson's dorm, huh?

576
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,030
Pal, good news.

577
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,860
The article that they did on me
in Altitude magazine

578
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,860
comes out today.

579
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,740
You're in Attitude?

580
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,370
That magazine is gay.

581
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:46,950
Oh, he wasn't being flip
with the word "gay."

582
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,170
Attitude is a British magazine
for homosexuals.

583
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:51,750
Altitude.

584
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,380
It is OutWest Airlines'
in-flight magazine.

585
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,420
Can I see it?

586
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,170
Probably doesn't have it.

587
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,220
Try finding a flight at this
time of the year.

588
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,970
You ever even been on a plane,
you piece of?

589
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:04,690
So can I see it?

590
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:07,730
It-it is not in the terrestrial
newsstands just yet.

591
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:09,440
Guess what though. You,
my friend, are in the article.

592
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,360
- I'm in it?
- You're in it, you're in it.

593
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,410
I mentioned you; I mentioned
that I'm living in your dorm.

594
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:15,870
I thought that it might help
with your popularity problem.

595
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:18,250
Well, I'm gonna get going

596
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:20,120
- while the room is empty, so...
- Okay. Great.

597
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:21,500
See you later.

598
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,180
Boy, that's got to
drive you crazy, right?

599
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,380
The whole reason you had to come

600
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,170
to the computer lab
was for privacy.

601
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,510
It's no wonder you can't
get a real girl up there.

602
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:31,060
Michael was referring
to something he'd walked in on

603
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,520
a few days earlier.

604
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,020
There's a girl in there.

605
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,350
There is?

606
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,400
Where the hell is
George Michael?

607
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,190
- Excuse me. Hello. Oh.
- Dad.

608
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:41,240
- Hi.
- Yeah.

609
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,400
There's nobody in here.

610
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:44,240
Buddy, bad news.

611
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,120
P-Hound is yanking
our chain again.

612
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,830
- Uncle Michael.
- Oh, my God.

613
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:48,960
- Hi.
- Hello there.

614
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,960
There is a kind of girl here.

615
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,540
Didn't say it was your cousin.

616
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:54,920
Well, he doesn't know.

617
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,210
Now, that's smart.

618
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,880
Let him think
there's a girl in here.

619
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:00,850
Actually, we've been talking
about how crowded that room is,

620
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:04,390
and P-Hound was suggesting that
maybe we, maybe we do a vote

621
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:06,230
to see who stays
in the dorm room.

622
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:08,060
He suggested that?
Are you serious?

623
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:10,990
Well, the thing is that the room
is only sanctioned for two.

624
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,190
Right, and we have a vote.

625
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,450
He's gone in two seconds.

626
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,200
Ah.

627
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,580
Two against one, right?

628
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,490
- Well, actually...
- We got to do it.

629
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:21,120
The thing is that it kind of
puts me in an awkward position.

630
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:22,830
- Hi.
- Hey.

631
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,590
Because since there's only
three people voting,

632
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:27,220
everyone's gonna know
who voted against who.

633
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,090
Well, what about if your
"girlfriend" wants to move in.

634
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:30,220
That way, she gets a vote.

635
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:32,890
I'm just here for tutoring.

636
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:34,350
She's not my girlfriend,
she's my cousin.

637
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:35,440
I'm not attracted to him.

638
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,100
Well, why's that even an issue?

639
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:39,440
P-Hound doesn't know
any of that stuff. Okay?

640
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,240
He'll just think that her vote's
the vote that got him out.

641
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,110
Well, wouldn't my girlfriend
want to get rid of my father?

642
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,530
- I'm not your girlfriend.
- Not your girlfriend.

643
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,490
No, but he doesn't know that.

644
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,160
No, well, someone's got to vote
for me, that's right.

645
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:51,500
Otherwise, it's suspicious.

646
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,250
We don't want
a palace coup, right?

647
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:54,880
- Well, I'll vote you out.
- Yeah, I will.

648
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,340
- Happy to do it.
- I wouldn't make you do that.

649
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,880
You know, then I fall down
a flight of stairs,

650
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,970
I crack my head open,
you feel bad

651
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:00,050
about yourself your whole life.

652
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:01,430
And perhaps it was the chair

653
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:03,260
that fooled Michael
into thinking

654
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,270
his next idea was a good one.

655
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:08,190
What if I vote myself out?

656
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,940
You'd do that?

657
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,150
How would that help?

658
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,990
It's simple algebra.

659
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:15,450
You two vote against P-Hound,
nobody knows who did what,

660
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:17,580
because there's a vote
against me in there,

661
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,660
and it's adios, brothiero.

662
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,410
It cannot fail.

663
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,670
Michael was pleased
with his plan.

664
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,380
Won't that make it a tie?

665
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,380
Briefly.

666
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,920
Hmm?

667
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:29,550
I mean, if the two of us
vote against P-Hound,

668
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:31,510
and you and P-Hound
vote against you,

669
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,470
then it's two against two,
right?

670
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:36,270
Wow, you think, you think
that'd he'd vote against me?

671
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,640
I mean...

672
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,480
Um...

673
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,940
All right, new plan.

674
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,610
The details of the plan

675
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:44,450
continued to develop
through lunch.

676
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:45,950
So we got two scenarios.

677
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,990
It's either two votes
against P-Hound,

678
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,700
one vote against Maeby,
one against me,

679
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:53,170
with that vote being my own;
or if it's two votes against me,

680
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:54,750
then clearly
P-Hound is being nasty,

681
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:56,960
that triggers a recount,
and then it's a P-Hound blitz.

682
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,460
We all vote against P-Hound,
he's gone.

683
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,670
Mm-hmm.

684
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,380
What if whoever loses...

685
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:02,640
Yeah?

686
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,600
...refuses to go?

687
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,020
You think P-Hound would do that?

688
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,480
Okay, new plan.

689
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,150
And so the planning
continued through

690
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:12,360
what should have been
organic chemistry.

691
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,530
We all pack ahead of time,

692
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:17,320
really pack a bag, so it doesn't
look rigged, you know?

693
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:18,950
And then the loser,
straight out the door.

694
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,410
I mean, that's-that's the deal.

695
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:22,200
You know, that's the cost
of having a vote,

696
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,210
that's the price of freedom.

697
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,670
You know, maybe it's...

698
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:26,210
maybe it's better
if we're all just

699
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:27,550
direct with each other,
you know?

700
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,090
Just-just say
what's on our minds.

701
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:30,630
Yeah, I think it's gonna
come out anyway.

702
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:35,140
Um, Dad, you know, I-I've really
loved living with you...

703
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,180
No talking.

704
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:40,060
No talking
once the votes come in.

705
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,730
You're just right out the door.
That's the missing piece.

706
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:43,400
That's it.

707
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,240
This plan is foolproof.

708
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,030
Oh, I've cherished this,
too, pal.

709
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:49,580
Yeah. I mean, how many,
how many fathers

710
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,500
get to go to college
with their kid, huh?

711
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:53,620
So obviously
this is what happened.

712
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:56,460
Michael read
his own vote first.

713
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,510
First vote to remove...

714
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:00,670
Michael.

715
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,340
Huh, what are you gonna do?

716
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,810
Second vote to remove...

717
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,690
...Michael.

718
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:14,360
Michael expected this,
but didn't expect the sting.

719
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,280
Wow.

720
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,780
Obviously, if there's a tie,
there's an immediate runoff.

721
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:22,490
Third vote to remove...

722
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,790
...Michael.

723
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:35,260
Did you mean
to write "George Michael"?

724
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:38,230
Obviously, the verdict was in.

725
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:40,270
And it's hard to know exactly

726
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:42,110
why Michael opened
the fourth ballot.

727
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:46,110
Was it out of hope
or confusion?

728
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:49,370
Either way, it couldn't be
what he wanted to read.

729
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:12,810
Michael did the only thing
he could think of

730
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:15,400
that would save face.

731
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:38,390
Michael had just been
stunned by some bad news.

732
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:40,270
And with nowhere to go,
he decided

733
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:43,060
to pick up a copy of Altitude
to lift his spirits.

734
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,570
- Hi. Hello.
- Hey.

735
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:46,150
Where you heading today, sir?

736
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:47,820
Well, actually,
I just wanted a copy

737
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:50,070
of your in-flight magazine
Altitude.

738
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,080
Ah, this is ticketing.

739
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,200
You can get the magazine
on the flight.

740
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:56,920
I get it. But I'm actually--
I'm in the magazine.

741
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,380
How many bags?

742
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,920
Oh, I'm not checking these.

743
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,970
Ah, sorry, you actually

744
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:03,550
can't carry those on board.

745
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,340
Let me start over.

746
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:07,470
Uh, I-I am the star of
Altitude magazine this month--

747
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:09,390
or quarter, actually.

748
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:12,150
It's an April-September issue,
and I just wanted to get a copy.

749
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,560
I'm not flying anywhere.

750
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:14,980
Why do you have suitcases?

751
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,280
Those are irrelevant.

752
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,360
Not to me.

753
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,320
Okay.

754
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,370
I was mistakenly voted out of
a four-person housing situation,

755
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:25,120
uh, in a pack-first,
no-talking-after scenario.

756
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,500
Does that clear it up for you?

757
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:29,000
What do you mean
by "mistakenly"?

758
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,170
I voted against myself to spare
my son the embarrassment

759
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:34,130
of, of having to vote
his own father out of his dorm.

760
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,340
That's all.

761
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:36,970
But that leaves
three other votes.

762
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:38,140
Yeah.

763
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,020
Can I get a copy
of the magazine, please?

764
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:42,390
No, I'm sorry,
they're actually for passengers.

765
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,150
We don't even give out
honey nuts, so we're not gonna

766
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:46,320
- give you a magazine.
- Who wants honey nuts?

767
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,530
I don't want the honey nuts.

768
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:48,860
I want to just jump
onto the plane,

769
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,070
- grab a magazine.
- Oh, okay,

770
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,490
yeah, sure, we just, uh,
let people walk

771
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:53,030
onto the plane all the time.

772
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,580
Do you want a box cutter also?

773
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,210
- Oh.
- Nice.

774
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:59,130
These guys are jerks.

775
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,380
Take that, take that.

776
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:03,130
Enjoy.

777
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:04,380
Tell you what--
give me a one- way ticket

778
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,470
to your cheapest destination,
please.

779
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:09,010
Oh, you lucked out.

780
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,980
Today it's Pittsburgh.

781
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:13,310
He's good.

782
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,110
What's the second cheapest?

783
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:17,070
So Michael ended up
spending a little more

784
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,900
to fly a little less,

785
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:21,240
and after some confusion
at security...

786
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,530
But you've got nothing
in your luggage.

787
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:23,620
I wasn't supposed to be
traveling today.

788
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:25,200
I told you, it was

789
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:26,290
a voting situation, there was a
miscalculation.

790
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:27,580
Well, I mean, obviously

791
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,170
P-Hound's gonna vote
against you.

792
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:30,960
- I've never seen nothing...
- These three people with burkas

793
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,670
just walked right by you.

794
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:35,050
...he found his seat.

795
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:38,140
Unfortunately the seat
he was assigned didn't have

796
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:40,060
a seat back pocket.

797
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:43,190
Hello, hi,
does each ticket entitle

798
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:44,940
the passenger
to an in-flight magazine?

799
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,440
No, it only guarantees you
a seat.

800
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,440
Perhaps I can ask
another passenger for one,

801
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,530
or if I'd rather, you can.

802
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:53,410
Michael had
to go back four seats

803
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:55,790
before someone would.

804
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:03,510
And Michael kicked himself
for a pose

805
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:06,720
he thought would express
humility to Sanjiv,

806
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,680
the Altitude photographer.

807
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,180
And so Michael--

808
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:15,100
a man who'd for years
threatened to leave

809
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:18,480
his family but had always
stayed for his son,

810
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:22,490
a man who no longer had that
excuse nor anywhere to live--

811
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:25,040
found himself
with nothing to lose

812
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,660
in a town
that he'd always imagined

813
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:29,710
would be his destiny,

814
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:33,250
and for the first time
in many years,

815
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,300
Michael had hope.

816
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:43,520
Michael steps out
of the air-conditioned airport.

817
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,520
Hope you know a good place
to live because I'm...

818
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,110
Ooh, dear Lord.

819
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:50,650
'Cause I'm looking

820
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:52,490
- to make a new start.
- Don't touch that handle.

821
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:53,820
Whoa, Mother of God!

822
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:55,790
Dear Lord!

823
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:57,200
Whoo!

824
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,210
And Michael returns

825
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:03,130
to the only viable place
he can think of to live...

826
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:05,460
Gentlemen, start your engines.

827
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:08,260
...where he begins his new life
cleaning up

828
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,260
after his family's old one.

829
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,850
Buster.

830
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:16,150
No... no, Gob.

831
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:18,150
Oh!

832
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:20,190
It was Lindsay.

833
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:59,610
