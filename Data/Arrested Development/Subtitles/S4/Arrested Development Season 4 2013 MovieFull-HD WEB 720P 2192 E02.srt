1
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,110
It was over a hundred degrees

2
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,780
on the border of California
and Mexico.

3
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,450
But that was nothing
compared to the temperature

4
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:21,750
inside George Sr.'s
desert sweat lodge...

5
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:23,500
So hot.

6
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,960
...where he had gathered
a group of CEOs...

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,300
So hot.

8
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,010
...with the promise of
spiritual enlightenment...

9
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:31,760
Anybody hallucinating yet?

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,970
Did anybody else
hear that iguana speak?

11
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,100
...as a stepping stone
to financial empowerment.

12
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,260
Let's kill it.

13
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,930
Okay. They're ready.

14
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,560
Of course, there were
certain occupational hazards.

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,890
All right, guys, easy.

16
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,690
- I'm not...
- Kill the iguana.

17
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,730
I'm not an iguana.

18
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:50,650
It's part of the process.

19
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,490
They're ready.
They're ready!

20
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,200
Now the story

21
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,120
of a family whose future
was abruptly canceled

22
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,120
and the one father
who had no choice

23
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,410
but to keep himself together.

24
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,460
It's George Sr.'s...

25
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,050
George Sr. was
getting ready to motivate

26
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,010
his gathered CEOs
after a narrow brush with death

27
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:21,520
at the hands
of a Frito-Lay executive.

28
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,060
Yeah!

29
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,900
Now, that was the most
invigorating session yet.

30
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,770
I feel good.

31
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:30,230
You feel good?

32
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,440
This is George Sr.

33
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,740
I got you.

34
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,150
You know, guys,
even I, Father B.,

35
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,610
when I first started
these sweat lodges,

36
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,070
I would come
out of there thinking,

37
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,280
oh, God, I wish
I had a... a lemonade.

38
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:43,120
Just like a child, you know.

39
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,870
Cold water, some lemons,
a little sugar, you know.

40
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,250
That's what I gave my power to!

41
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,500
Can we have
the teaching pitcher please?

42
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:52,550
Heartfire.

43
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,630
Hey, guys, this is Heartfire.

44
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:54,960
She is silent,

45
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:58,510
but in that silence,
there is strength.

46
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,640
She needs no words
to communicate to you.

47
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,440
Boundless power
to you, too, Heartfire.

48
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,020
Hell, I was so weak, you guys,

49
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,940
I was willing to spend $10, 000
just a little...

50
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,490
...sip of this lemonade.

51
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:17,860
Fifteen!

52
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,490
But now I can spend
two hours in brutal heat

53
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:22,530
with a cup of this
cold, refreshing lemonade

54
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,290
and just pour it in the dirt.

55
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,040
Ah, come on, Daniels!

56
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,290
You ran Bear Stearns,
for God's sake!

57
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:29,460
I was like this.

58
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,290
Just like this.

59
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,340
Then I went to the desert
to seek answers,

60
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,340
and now I have them.

61
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:38,090
Actually, George Sr.
had come to the desert

62
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:40,390
to escape questions.

63
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:43,260
Years earlier, after duping
his twin brother Oscar...

64
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,310
- You gave me up, George.
- George? I'm not George.

65
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,140
...into taking his place
at a party

66
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,560
the family held
on the Queen Mary,

67
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,850
George Sr. stowed away
with a son

68
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,610
who was also
fleeing the family.

69
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:56,190
How was the party?

70
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,650
Mom stole it.

71
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,900
- The whole boat?
- She had.

72
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,320
- As she fled to sea...
- Full steam, boys!

73
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:05,910
...a strategy
their lawyer's son came up with

74
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,000
on his first day back in
the country after law school.

75
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,540
I'm wondering if
we shouldn't have a plan

76
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,170
in regards to bookkeeping,

77
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:13,960
in case we accidentally
make a mistake or get caught.

78
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,710
What if we were
to become a... an-an... an NLC?

79
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,050
- Ooh!
- A "No Liability Corporation."

80
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,090
We just have no liability,
just nothing...

81
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,140
Well, first of all, I would
avoid doing anything illegal.

82
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,310
May I make a suggestion?

83
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,560
- Sure.
- Take to the sea!

84
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,350
Three miles out,
and it's a free-for-all!

85
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,560
No rules, pirate radio laws.

86
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:36,730
Really!
Is this true, Mr. Zuckerkorn?

87
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,400
Sure.

88
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,450
So we will stick together
and have

89
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:42,240
all of our meetings on boats.

90
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,410
Well, uh, I don't know
if that's necessary.

91
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:46,200
Yeah, because they don't have to
be together, because you can't

92
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,830
try a husband and wife
for the same crime, right?

93
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,580
Sure.

94
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,910
We have the best
attorneys.

95
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,920
You think we should go back?

96
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,170
Absolutely. She's your mother.

97
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:57,630
Family has to stick together.

98
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,340
You're afraid
she'll turn on you.

99
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,590
Won't even leave the table
during a dinner party.

100
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,800
Okay.

101
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,550
We're going back,
George Michael!

102
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:07,430
It turned out, Lucille had
returned to shore, too.

103
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,350
Why the alleged ship-jacker

104
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,140
changed direction
is still unexplained.

105
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,400
And soon the family met up

106
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,060
at the beginning
of a fourth season...

107
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,940
- My wife, how is she?
- ...that would never come.

108
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,610
She's fine. You're lucky
we didn't have an autumn,

109
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:19,730
otherwise she'd be colder.

110
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,070
Look what they've done, George!

111
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,320
Look what the homosexuals
have done to me.

112
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,950
A joyride.

113
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,910
That's what they decide to do
with the freedom

114
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,410
this country has given them.

115
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,200
That's the best alibi
I've been able

116
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,370
to come up with, because
our lawyer says he thinks

117
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:34,920
he can get rid
of the SEC charges,

118
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,880
but he's worried about
the pirating of theQueen Mary.

119
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,840
Says they have
a suit against us.

120
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,380
- Where is Barry?
- He's with the harbormaster.

121
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:45,340
He's trying to dazzle them
with a suit of his own.

122
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,300
Well, he hated the suit.

123
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,140
Thought I was making fun.

124
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,520
But basically, this is
a "good news/bad news" deal.

125
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,770
First of all, won't be cheap.

126
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,980
It's gonna cost you
a fortune in legal fees.

127
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,020
- What's the good news?
- Oh, yeah.

128
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,690
Well, from your perspective,
I can see where

129
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:01,980
you think it's all bad news.

130
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,240
It's all bad news.

131
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,490
Also, it turns out

132
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,030
that stealing theQueen Mary

133
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,530
comes under maritime law,

134
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,830
which, I just found out,
is an actual thing.

135
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:10,870
It's a real thing.

136
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:11,990
Don't you worry.

137
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,040
We got three months

138
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,500
to prepare for this hearing.

139
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,130
And so, George Sr.
went to his competitor,

140
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,960
Stan Sitwell, with an offer,

141
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,760
so he could afford to cover
Lucille's high legal fees.

142
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,550
Buy the rest of your stock?
You got to be kidding me.

143
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,550
I already dumped the stock
I owned to Lucille Austero.

144
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,140
Don't forget,
I was on that boat.

145
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,510
And believe me, I lost

146
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,600
more than just the 50 grand
on that sale.

147
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,810
I also lost
a perfectly good pair of

148
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:36,270
human chest hair nipple tufts
when we hit the water.

149
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,810
Stan Sitwell
suffered from alopecia,

150
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,400
a condition
that rendered him hairless.

151
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,730
That's kelp;
why would I put it onto my chest

152
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,240
or head or anywhere else?

153
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,820
I was gonna
show those babies off

154
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,780
- at the Jacuzzi after-party.
- Come on, Stan.

155
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,410
I'm offering you
the chance to double

156
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,330
- the size of your business.
- Way ahead of you.

157
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:52,870
I've got a big project
coming up.

158
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:54,750
And even you can't
compete for this one,

159
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:55,830
with your business in the shape
that it's in.

160
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:56,910
This is a biggie.

161
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,080
I get this contract,

162
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,670
and it gets government approval,

163
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,250
I'll be bigger than Halliburton.

164
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:02,880
Well, maybe not Halliburton,

165
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,340
but definitely Halliburton Teen.

166
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,010
Halliburton Teen was a leading

167
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,430
youth and lifestyle retailer,
despite the fact

168
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:13,350
that it was a rebranding
of the tarnished Halliburton.

169
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,100
Penitentiary and
Rendition Systems.

170
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,640
It's also how their
deep-water drilling enterprise

171
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,770
spawned this company.

172
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,020
Anyway, you're too late.

173
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,570
The contract is
practically mine.

174
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:27,070
Even you can't underbid me.

175
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:29,740
Well, you may have
a bigger business than me,

176
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:32,700
but you will never have this.

177
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,660
And believe me,
I'm gonna find out

178
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,040
that project you're working on,
even if I have to search

179
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,210
the public records
for the blueprints myself.

180
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,840
Unless you search
in this office,

181
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,590
you will never find them.

182
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,550
Oh... aah...!

183
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,850
Ow, my hair!
My beautiful hair!

184
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,770
My hair!
My beautiful hair!

185
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,730
This isn't what it looks like!

186
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:05,230
Oh, really?

187
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:08,740
Because it looks like a monument
to George W. Bush.

188
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,490
Well, you got me.

189
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,580
You're in for
a rude awakening, Sitwell.

190
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,200
It'll never stand.

191
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,540
It's too thin.

192
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,920
It'll never stand.

193
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,130
You see, the W's
and the word "bush."

194
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:24,880
I mean, what else could it be?

195
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,420
You mean other than
a 20-foot-wide monument

196
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,300
that goes five miles
into the sky?

197
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,970
I know, I know. And I told him
it wouldn't stand,

198
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:35,220
which I probably shouldn't have.

199
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:38,810
It's a wall, George;
you're looking at it sideways.

200
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,390
The W stands for "wall."

201
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,600
The bushes...

202
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,110
Stand for the bushes.

203
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:46,440
Ah--this explains
the immigration booth

204
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,230
10, 000 feet in the air.

205
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,570
It's to separate
the U.S. and Mexico,

206
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,820
to keep out the immigrants,
which was my idea!

207
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,450
Was your idea. I remember.

208
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:57,330
You said that right after
Lupe got the bleach stain

209
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:58,830
on your teal blazer.

210
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,960
How did you miss this, George?

211
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,370
This is business we should have.

212
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:06,210
Is this how you're going to
let it all end, as a failure?

213
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,000
- Is that your plan?
- No.

214
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,710
Of course not.

215
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,720
It was his plan.

216
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,810
George Sr. felt
discouraged and alone...

217
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:20,350
Bluth for two--I mean, one.

218
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,020
I thought I already seated you.

219
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:25,350
...when he saw a familiar face:
his own...

220
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,690
...on his twin brother Oscar.

221
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:31,030
George!
Actually, we came in

222
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:33,280
to use the bathroom,
but they sat me.

223
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,620
And they have mahimahi today.

224
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,780
Will you join us?
Will you have a mahimahi on me?

225
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,990
- On you.
- Fine, but I'm gonna

226
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,960
sit opposite you,
so it won't look bad.

227
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,170
These are my friends; we all
live in the desert together.

228
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:48,210
This is Heartfire;
she's an aura specialist.

229
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,340
She did Matthew Modine.

230
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:53,550
I will.

231
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,680
Heartfire would like
some more crackers.

232
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,680
Oscar, you don't believe
that nonsense, do you?

233
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,310
No, no, no. You're a skeptic.

234
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,930
But I'll tell you something,
the desert changes you.

235
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,020
Dr. Norman is
a disgraced anesthesiologist.

236
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,140
Oh.

237
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:06,770
The bigger crime would've been

238
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,730
the patient didn't wake up
and testify against me.

239
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:11,110
But nobody cares about the part
of the oath he kept.

240
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,440
I'll tell you this.

241
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,780
If that nastiness
had never happened,

242
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,320
I never would've gotten
those prison pen pal letters

243
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,200
from the most beautiful woman
in the world.

244
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,000
If he as bad as the
state of California say he is,

245
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,910
then why did I fall in love
with him, huh?

246
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,920
Yo,  the state
of California!

247
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,130
'em!

248
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:32,050
Bunch of
California , yeah.

249
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:34,760
As you can imagine,
her letters really stood out.

250
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,510
Do you know China Garden?

251
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,300
I know the downtown one.

252
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,640
You know, I shouldn't judge.

253
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,220
'Cause you have friends,
and I...

254
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,640
I envy that.

255
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,020
You're welcome
to my friends, brother.

256
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,860
I don't want these.

257
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,240
But perhaps due to
the absence of Lucille,

258
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,360
the two brothers connected
as they hadn't in years.

259
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:00,370
I'm not the big man
I thought I was.

260
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:02,990
Forget the past, George.

261
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,330
I don't know; maybe it's
because I live on the border

262
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,460
between the United States
and Mexico and...

263
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,330
Hold on. Border?

264
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,710
You don't think I live
like this all the time, do you?

265
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,760
That's why I had so much fun
at that party on theQueen Mary.

266
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,010
And you paid for my haircut.

267
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,260
And you made me...
dress like you.

268
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,850
Forget the past.

269
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:24,770
What were you saying about
that property on the border?

270
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:27,050
And that's when George Sr.
first saw the desert property.

271
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,400
And the much smaller sweat
lodge that was on the land.

272
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,480
You live here?

273
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,820
Ask him!

274
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,860
Would you like
to watch us make love?

275
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,030
No. You live here?

276
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,610
We have been.

277
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:41,240
You see, Mexico starts
right at the end of that gully,

278
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,370
and we have to get
in and out of there

279
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,040
so we can get at the maca root.

280
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,700
What the hell is maca root?

281
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,000
It's an ancient Aztec
power herb.

282
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,250
It's an endocrine adaptogen.

283
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:51,920
It's legal to grow in Mexico,

284
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,050
but it's against the law
to consume it there.

285
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:56,760
Of course, you can ingest it
here, but you can't grow it.

286
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,760
And... you can bring it
into Mexico,

287
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,340
but you can't bring it out.

288
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,310
So it's, uh, hard.

289
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:06,180
So you guys are knowingly
breaking the law?

290
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:09,560
But it's worth it, because maca
has powerful properties,

291
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,270
especially when combined with
an hour in the sweat lodge.

292
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:15,610
It gets up to 110 degrees
in there.

293
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:17,150
Sounds fun.

294
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:19,110
Oh, but you have to do it
with us.

295
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:21,150
You'll find a power
you didn't know you had.

296
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,990
But, um, you want to do it soon,

297
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:28,290
because they're
kicking us off of the land.

298
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,750
I'm sorry.

299
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,670
Oh, great.
Now you're gonna make me cry.

300
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:33,130
Oh, lizard! Look!
Look, a lizard!

301
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:34,290
Cute!

302
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,960
What if I were to buy
this land?

303
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,090
I don't understand;
why would you want to do that?

304
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:41,510
Well, I always talk about
being a great man.

305
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:44,390
Maybe a way to do that is
not by being

306
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,470
the biggest businessman in
Southern California, it's...

307
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:50,140
It's by being the best brother
in Southern California.

308
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:52,060
George Sr. was going to say,

309
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,520
"By gouging the government
when they needed the land..."

310
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,860
You bet.

311
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,320
Hey, guys, we're staying.

312
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,690
Oh, thank you, brother.

313
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,070
...but he'd save that
for Lucille.

314
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:03,950
- Thank you, maca.
- Thank you, maca!

315
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,570
And I can get this land
for a song.

316
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,990
George was proud of his plan.

317
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,120
Are you listening to me?

318
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,000
So are those cameras, George.

319
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,460
We can't use the same cameras

320
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,710
from when he was under
house arrest?

321
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,790
These are from
the maritime penal system.

322
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,920
They make us use
the waterproof ones.

323
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,460
- In here.
- Okay.

324
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,210
We're gonna sell that land

325
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,720
to the government
for Sitwell's wall,

326
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,340
and I'm gonna take the cash.

327
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:26,970
I am gonna mount a case
that shows that my wife

328
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,970
is not the power-hungry monster

329
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,480
the SEC wants
to make her out to be.

330
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,940
You're such a puny thinker.

331
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,270
Am I puny-thinking again?

332
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:36,560
Sitwell's wall?

333
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:38,570
How about our wall?
We build the wall.

334
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:40,860
We do have the plan.

335
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,900
He says he can build it
for $200 million,

336
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:45,030
we offer to build it
for $150 million,

337
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:47,870
and we make up the difference
when we sell the land.

338
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:51,790
And I use that cash
as a little stimulus for us.

339
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,580
Maybe a little something
for the family.

340
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,460
And we build that sucker...

341
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,750
That's my Georgie!

342
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:57,880
...five miles high.

343
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,090
Long. Five miles long.

344
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:03,630
I got nothing in my system
but a maca root cookie.

345
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,590
So, that one's all set.

346
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,390
Uh... can I put one up there?

347
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:10,850
Only if you want to see the
sexiest video you've ever seen.

348
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:15,520
Sorry I gave you
the old noodle stab in there.

349
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,560
I needed
something in my system.

350
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:21,570
You know, we can't look like
we're in cahoots on this.

351
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,780
Especially with my trial
coming up.

352
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,150
Yeah, that's right.

353
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,240
We have to separate our assets.

354
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,620
To protect this.

355
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,330
To protect our love.

356
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:33,010
And that's
when they got the idea

357
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,500
to pretend they were
getting a divorce.

358
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,460
We're getting a divorce.

359
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,170
I want to know about
the stimulus package.

360
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:42,840
We haven't had sex
since Christmas, Michael!

361
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,170
Uh... I'm... I'm sorry.

362
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:48,050
You had sex seven weeks ago?

363
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:51,100
They were remodeling my room,
and I pulled my cot in there,

364
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,430
- just like camp.
- We yelled at you to leave.

365
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,320
Yeah, but then you whispered,
"Don't pull out!"

366
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,650
You didn't want to use
any of that money for...

367
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:04,610
You couldn't use any of that
money to finish Sudden Valley?

368
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:06,740
And although their plan
was dealt a minor setback

369
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,910
when Michael sold
the controlling shares

370
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:11,030
to Lucille 2...

371
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,080
You know what?
I am done with this family.

372
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,450
I hope you've saved some money,

373
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,410
'cause you're gonna need
every dime now.

374
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,830
...all they had to do

375
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,630
was keep their plan
a secret from her

376
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,130
and cash in quickly.

377
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:23,300
4:28 in the morning
here in the O.C.

378
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,880
I'm John Beard.

379
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,970
Well, there was some more
grim economic news today.

380
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:28,550
The housing prices
continue to plummet,

381
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:30,640
and the economists say
it may take quite some--

382
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,390
What are you...
what are you doing?

383
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:35,390
I'm John Beard,
and I'm a Gloomy Gus.

384
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,060
I don't have a mustache.

385
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,100
And the government
put the wall project on hold.

386
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,730
Can't be on hold.

387
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:43,150
They already gave me the money
to start the building.

388
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,900
No! I cannot live off of that!

389
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:49,240
No, I already used that money
as the down payment

390
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,280
of six square miles of desert

391
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,410
I cannot afford
to make payments on!

392
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:57,040
Oh, God... sorry, Norman.

393
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,790
Huh?

394
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,040
Uh, nothing.

395
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,090
Hey, brother, you seem tense.

396
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:04,590
Come with me to the sweat lodge.

397
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,630
Sweat out this frustration;
you can learn on this.

398
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,970
And perhaps
it was a sense of futility

399
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:11,720
or the fact he hadn't
brought a book to the desert,

400
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:16,560
but George Sr. chose to enter
the small, smoke-filled room,

401
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,640
while his wife
was also confined

402
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,480
to a smoke-filled room,

403
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,440
having found a way around
both the building's strict

404
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,020
no-smoking policy...

405
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,360
...and the fact that her ankle
monitor prevented her

406
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,320
from approaching the balcony.

407
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:36,490
So, anyways, I went down
to the club and I... I can't...

408
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,210
My food was gone, I could...

409
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:52,050
That restaurant, typically,
has a really nice maitre d'...

410
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:04,520
Can't really remember
the host's name,

411
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,730
but he was...
he was kind of in his 60s...

412
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,790
I have to stop.

413
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:23,620
I have to stop. So...

414
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,920
But, finally, I just ordered...

415
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,260
pastrami shortcake, like I said,
but I didn't order...

416
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,300
I didn't order sprinkles this--
Oh, Mother, please.

417
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,840
Please.

418
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,510
Meanwhile,
in George Sr.'s sweat lodge,

419
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:39,770
a solution to his problems
was emerging, as well...

420
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,480
Kind of hot, huh?

421
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:46,520
I'd give $10, 000 for a glass
of lemonade right now.

422
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,690
...in the form of a vision.

423
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:55,610
Sweat... and squeeze.

424
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,370
It was to be
a "sweat and squeeze."

425
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:00,790
Dr. Norman?

426
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:03,370
Dr. Norman, we have a hot mess.

427
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:07,290
George Sr. had been passed out

428
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:10,170
for two days
after having a vision...

429
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:13,760
which is why this seat was
empty at his wife's trial.

430
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,010
But soon,
he was hard at work...

431
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:18,260
Okay, look up large mud huts.

432
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,890
- ...making his vision a reality.
- Can fit 20.

433
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:21,850
Do a something search.
Um, used is fine.

434
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:24,230
No, no, I got it.

435
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,270
Sweat caves.

436
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,480
See what you get.

437
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:29,110
You got 'em?

438
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,520
All right, well, then, ship it!

439
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:32,730
A sweat lodge,
where he could be

440
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:36,700
a preacher of profit to other
type-A executives like himself.

441
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,410
All right, this whole area here,

442
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:40,830
this is going to be
visitor yurts.

443
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:45,330
Oh, and we're gonna need
industrial-size juicers!

444
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:47,460
He went to work
on constructing a seminar,

445
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,170
much of which he borrowed
from his brief stint

446
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:52,090
as a Jewish-y guru
while in prison.

447
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:54,090
Now's your chance
to own the entire

448
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:55,840
George Bluth
"Caged Wisdom" library...

449
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,630
Will you read that back
to me, please?

450
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,010
This time, however, he needed
to be actually ordained

451
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,720
as a religious preacher
to avoid tax implications.

452
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,390
Lemonade!

453
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:05,640
But fortunately, there was
a Phoenix for him, too.

454
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,310
Almost there. Question three.

455
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,560
But business
really took off when

456
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,480
an article about George Sr.'s
operation appeared

457
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:16,070
in an exclusively first-class
in-flight magazine.

458
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:19,160
And soon the retreat was up
and running, and George Sr.

459
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,990
was determined
to create the illusion

460
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:23,660
of a first-class experience.

461
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,540
And did you want the partial
bush or broken gate view?

462
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:29,620
The seminar was
reasonably priced at $1, 000.

463
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:31,920
The sweat and squeeze
was simple.

464
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,460
First, George Sr. sweated out
his acolytes' defenses...

465
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,840
Ah, come on, Daniels!

466
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,970
You ran Bear Stearns,
for God's sake!

467
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:40,300
I was like this.

468
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,640
Then I went to the desert
to seek answers,

469
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,270
and now I have them.

470
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:47,730
...and then it was time
for the squeeze.

471
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:50,940
And for another 15 grand,
you can have them, too.

472
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,020
I'll teach you
how to get yachts,

473
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:55,650
I'll teach you how
to get penthouses,

474
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:57,950
and how to get
something for yourself

475
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:01,700
by taking it from someone
who thinks it's his.

476
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,240
Does it come with lemonade?

477
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:06,290
It comes with all the lemonade
you can drink.

478
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:07,250
"Squeeze" had two meanings.

479
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:08,410
Who's in?

480
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,330
Sign 'em up. Sign 'em up.

481
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,290
Come on, get your
wallets out, let's go, guys.

482
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,630
And George Sr.
had even found a great way

483
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:18,470
- to handle the heat.
- Hey.

484
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,800
Hey.

485
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,390
He had his twin brother
endure it.

486
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,180
Did you bring me some lemonade?

487
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:26,140
No, sir.
It is crazy out there.

488
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,850
For the first time we are out.

489
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:31,650
Look what I brought you,
Mr. Oscar--

490
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:33,980
50 bucks--your half.

491
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,980
Oh, you know,
I feel bad taking this.

492
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,940
All I did was sit and sweat.

493
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:40,360
Which is why it seemed

494
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,240
that Father B. was so resilient

495
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:46,330
to the depleting effects
of the sweat lodge.

496
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,910
Whoo! Yeah!

497
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,790
Now, that was the most
invigorating session yet.

498
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:59,630
Hey, buddy, come on,
it's happening, you know.

499
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,430
We're helping people.

500
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:05,350
- - If I could give you
just one note, little energy.

501
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:07,680
As the retreat grew,

502
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,890
George Sr. was finding himself
emboldened with power,

503
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:13,480
while Oscar was bushed.

504
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,690
Hey, Oscar, that scared me.

505
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:17,230
Come on, man, get back in there.

506
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,780
I was starting to sweat.

507
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,860
I'm just trying
to get my strength up.

508
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,150
Maca usually gets me there.

509
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,740
Hey, chew some maca with me.

510
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,120
I can't, okay, I got to go up
to see Lucille tomorrow.

511
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,660
George Sr. had been meeting

512
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,830
with Lucille on a weekly basis
at her new home

513
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:34,210
under the pretense
of working on their divorce.

514
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,250
You look nice.

515
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:36,500
Oh, stop trying to butter me up.

516
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,420
Let's just get
this divorce agreed to

517
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,920
so you can get out of here.

518
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,680
Oh, God.

519
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,760
It's almost
like adultery this way.

520
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,470
Good, I like that.

521
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,850
- "My wife doesn't understand me."
- My angel.

522
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:53,230
"I haven't had an orgasm outside
of my bathtub in 30 years."

523
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:55,650
How's that?

524
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:58,110
Although, at times,
I do wish it were darker.

525
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:01,240
It's too bad you don't
have time to try this.

526
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,900
Yesterday,
I was talking to a lizard,

527
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:05,280
and it turned into
Elizabeth Taylor.

528
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,530
- Young Elizabeth Taylor?
- Uh-huh.

529
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,160
Yeah, I could use some maca.

530
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,660
Give me some of that.

531
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:14,540
And soon a vision did appear.

532
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,210
I don't know what's going on.

533
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:20,210
For some reason I'm just getting
Richard Burton today.

534
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,460
Oh, my God, what's that?

535
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,840
That's the commode.

536
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,300
Are you at all concerned
that the maca bush

537
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,580
is directly downhill from that?

538
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,220
He should have been,

539
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,390
but Oscar was actually
referring to what now appeared

540
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:35,310
to be a divine spirit,
personified as an ostrich.

541
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:37,350
You trespass on sacred ground.

542
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,730
The spirits command me
to warn you.

543
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:42,650
You must leave this land
or the land will change you.

544
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:44,570
Don't worry, he's probably

545
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:46,910
from a local reservation.
I'll, I'll take care of this.

546
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:51,080
How about you book me two nights
for Ray Romano at your casino?

547
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,710
The strong will become the weak,
the weak will become the strong.

548
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:58,420
And get us close to the front
but not close enough

549
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,500
that Ray talks to us.

550
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,380
You have been warned.

551
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,630
See ya.

552
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:10,720
I don't know what you saw, but
I got an ostrich and no boner.

553
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:16,390
One year after George Sr. had

554
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,310
the incident
with the ostrich guy,

555
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:20,270
things had indeed started
to change.

556
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,820
Where was I? Um... oh, yeah.

557
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,480
Father B. had lost his command
over the crowd.

558
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:26,860
Who would like some lemonade
for $2, 000?

559
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:31,030
Come on, guys,
I looked the other way

560
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:33,160
on the bottled water
because you look thirsty,

561
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,290
but you got to play along here.
Heartfire?

562
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:37,960
Where's the lemonade?

563
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,670
Shh!

564
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:42,590
And as business slowed down...

565
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:43,590
Will you excuse me just one sec?

566
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,050
...Oscar had started being

567
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:47,630
more independent
and harder to find.

568
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,590
Norman, have you seen Oscar?

569
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,760
No, have you seen China Garden?

570
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,760
No.

571
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,100
Did you kill that armadillo?

572
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,810
No, no, he's just under.

573
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:57,730
If only we could use some of
his medicine for our own pain.

574
00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:01,770
Oh, wait, I've got
a full syringe in the car.

575
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:03,650
And George Sr. would soon get

576
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:05,190
worse economic news from
his attorney.

577
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:06,690
Oh, this can't be good.

578
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,110
I mean, you didn't drive all

579
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:09,610
this distance for good news.

580
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,160
You've got a balloon payment due

581
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,070
on the mortgage
on this property.

582
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,200
It's about $15 million.

583
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,870
I mean, I-- what am I gonna do?

584
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:17,500
Where am I gonna get that money?

585
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,460
I thought you were going to sell
the land to the government

586
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,790
to build the wall.

587
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,170
Yeah, but that was put on hold.

588
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:24,210
So?
It's election time.

589
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:27,170
Now's the time to get a
politician to push for the wall.

590
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,800
Isn't that dizzy kook
Lucille Austero running?

591
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,550
No, no, she,
she can't know about this.

592
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:34,930
She's the majority owner
of my company,

593
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:36,180
and besides,
she's so pro-immigrant.

594
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,810
She was.

595
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:40,440
She'd even taken in
a Latino foster child,

596
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,110
which she denied was an attempt
to bring in the Hispanic vote.

597
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:46,440
Nonetheless, she did know what
cultural buttons to push

598
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,190
to win their hearts.

599
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,940
Doesn't matter,
she's not going to win anyway.

600
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:52,660
The guy you want is the guy
she's running against--

601
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,280
Herbert Love, right?

602
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,700
He's got a rally tonight.

603
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,040
Go and see him.

604
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,950
Everyone knows how persuasive
you can be.

605
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,290
Used to be.

606
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:03,500
I'd be lucky to sell
a glass of lemonade

607
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,090
for a thousand dollars today.

608
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:06,090
Now, listen.

609
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:08,050
If I can take no more

610
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:10,920
than a law degree
from the Virgin Islands...

611
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:13,510
- Yeah.
- ...a-a-and turn it into a net worth

612
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:16,510
of $750, 000--

613
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,310
before, of course,
what I owe in lawsuits--

614
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:22,100
you can talk a politician into
wasting public funds on a wall.

615
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,230
Wait, wait,
that rally is tonight?

616
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,520
- Mm-hmm.
- But I'm supposed

617
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,150
to meet my wife tonight,

618
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:28,480
which I am dreading, by the way.

619
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:30,320
One of the changes

620
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,280
that had occurred
over the previous year...

621
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,910
- My right rear tire is low.
- ...was a decrease

622
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:38,990
in the physical intimacy George
Sr. and his wife had enjoyed.

623
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,120
You're so ugly from behind.

624
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:46,750
'Cause if no one
shows up at that office,

625
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:48,550
she really will divorce me.

626
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:50,170
Too bad you can't use a double.

627
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:51,670
Oh, also I used a look-alike

628
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,640
named Stewart to take
the California bar for me.

629
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,010
But you knew that, right?

630
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,140
- Oscar.
- And later,

631
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:02,640
while once again looking
for his own double...

632
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,850
- Oscar.
- ...George, who was acting more like Oscar,

633
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,820
finally found Oscar, who was
acting more like George.

634
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:09,820
Why aren't you sweating?

635
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,940
Maybe I had a better offer.

636
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:14,200
And not a word to Dr. Norman.

637
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,240
He doesn't think
women should be awake for it.

638
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,200
"Oh, great Dr. Norman."

639
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,080
You know, we have
to be very careful.

640
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,290
Oscar, we are trying
to help people here.

641
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:25,500
I know, I know, I know,
but you know what?

642
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:29,290
It just gets hot
in there sometimes!

643
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:32,090
Whoa, we don't,
we don't have to yell.

644
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:35,840
Why not you go do hot sweat,
let Oscar do squeeze?

645
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,800
All right, I mean,
I'm not saying that.

646
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:40,510
I just, uh, I need a break.

647
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,270
I just can't go on

648
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:45,770
- pretending to be you, sitting silently...
- Shh.

649
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:49,360
...in a, in a 100-degree mud hut
for an hour and a half.

650
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,280
I am begging you--
there has to be something else

651
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,400
I can impersonate you doing.

652
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,570
It's funny you should say that

653
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:03,700
because, uh, if you're okay
with the sitting silently part,

654
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,710
I have something for you
that's quite chilling.

655
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:08,080
- Thank you.
- And so George Sr. left

656
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,790
to seek out the right-wing
politician Herbert Love

657
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:14,800
as Oscar headed out to visit
Lucille, disguised as George,

658
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,680
which is exactly
who Barry thought

659
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,390
he was talking to.

660
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:20,260
I just pooped in a hole
and covered it up.

661
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,010
I hope I did the right thing.

662
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:23,640
There's a commode.

663
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,390
It's, it's directly uphill
from the maca root.

664
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:27,640
Yeah, I really feel bad
for the guy that's got

665
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:30,230
to dig that up
for the foundation for the wall.

666
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,610
Yeah, wha-what wall?

667
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:37,110
Very good, George.

668
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:39,910
We got to be careful
where we talk about this.

669
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:41,950
Ooh, I got to watch my words.

670
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:44,620
And that's when
Oscar realized that George Sr.

671
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,370
didn't buy the land

672
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:50,460
to be the best brother
in Southern California.

673
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:57,300
We 12publishes
a rare retraction.

674
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:00,590
Oscar confirms his suspicions
of the wall

675
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,840
while impersonating George Sr.

676
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:03,470
I thought we...

677
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:05,680
I thought
we could talk about the wall.

678
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,980
You know, the wall.

679
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,900
Have you baked your brain
in that pizza oven,

680
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,440
or is senility your backup plan

681
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,070
if we can't get the government
to buy the property?

682
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:17,860
So we only did buy
that land for personal gain.

683
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,990
Well,  what Oscar does-doesn't know

684
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,160
won't hurt him.

685
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,530
Oscar.

686
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,700
And although it wasn't

687
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,370
a perfect impersonation...

688
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:28,160
I love it when you call my name.

689
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,460
...he did have the maca root.

690
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,370
George!

691
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,580
Don't call me that.

692
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:36,130
Call me Father B.

693
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:59,160
