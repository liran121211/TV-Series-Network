2
00:00:09,713 --> 00:00:12,007
It was over a hundred degrees

3
00:00:12,049 --> 00:00:15,677
on the border of California
and Mexico.

4
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:18,347
But that was nothing
compared to the temperature

5
00:00:18,388 --> 00:00:21,641
inside George Sr.'s
desert sweat lodge...

6
00:00:21,683 --> 00:00:23,392
So hot.

7
00:00:23,434 --> 00:00:25,854
...where he had gathered
a group of CEOs...

8
00:00:25,896 --> 00:00:28,190
So hot.

9
00:00:28,232 --> 00:00:29,900
...with the promise of
spiritual enlightenment...

10
00:00:29,941 --> 00:00:31,651
Anybody hallucinating yet?

11
00:00:31,693 --> 00:00:34,863
Did anybody else
hear that iguana speak?

12
00:00:34,905 --> 00:00:37,991
...as a stepping stone
to financial empowerment.

13
00:00:38,033 --> 00:00:39,159
Let's kill it.

14
00:00:39,201 --> 00:00:41,828
Okay. They're ready.

15
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,454
Of course, there were
certain occupational hazards.

16
00:00:43,496 --> 00:00:44,789
All right, guys, easy.

17
00:00:44,831 --> 00:00:46,583
- I'm not...
- Kill the iguana.

18
00:00:46,624 --> 00:00:48,626
I'm not an iguana.

19
00:00:48,668 --> 00:00:50,545
It's part of the process.

20
00:00:50,587 --> 00:00:53,382
They're ready.
They're ready!

21
00:00:53,423 --> 00:00:55,092
Now the story

22
00:00:55,133 --> 00:00:58,011
of a family whose future
was abruptly canceled

23
00:00:58,053 --> 00:01:00,013
and the one father
who had no choice

24
00:01:00,055 --> 00:01:02,307
but to keep himself together.

25
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:08,355
It's George Sr.'s...

26
00:01:12,817 --> 00:01:14,945
George Sr. was
getting ready to motivate

27
00:01:14,986 --> 00:01:18,907
his gathered CEOs
after a narrow brush with death

28
00:01:18,949 --> 00:01:21,410
at the hands
of a Frito-Lay executive.

29
00:01:22,452 --> 00:01:23,954
Yeah!

30
00:01:23,995 --> 00:01:26,790
Now, that was the most
invigorating session yet.

31
00:01:26,831 --> 00:01:28,666
I feel good.

32
00:01:28,708 --> 00:01:30,127
You feel good?

33
00:01:30,168 --> 00:01:32,337
This is George Sr.

34
00:01:32,379 --> 00:01:34,631
I got you.

35
00:01:34,672 --> 00:01:36,049
You know, guys, 
even I, Father B.,

36
00:01:36,091 --> 00:01:37,508
when I first started
these sweat lodges,

37
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:38,969
I would come
out of there thinking,

38
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:41,179
oh, God, I wish
I had a... a lemonade.

39
00:01:41,221 --> 00:01:43,014
Just like a child, you know.

40
00:01:43,056 --> 00:01:46,768
Cold water, some lemons, 
a little sugar, you know.

41
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:49,146
That's what I gave my power to!

42
00:01:49,187 --> 00:01:51,398
Can we have
the teaching pitcher please?

43
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,441
Heartfire.

44
00:01:52,482 --> 00:01:53,524
Hey, guys, this is Heartfire.

45
00:01:53,566 --> 00:01:54,859
She is silent,

46
00:01:54,901 --> 00:01:58,405
but in that silence, 
there is strength.

47
00:01:58,447 --> 00:02:00,531
She needs no words
to communicate to you.

48
00:02:04,035 --> 00:02:06,330
Boundless power
to you, too, Heartfire.

49
00:02:06,371 --> 00:02:08,915
Hell, I was so weak, you guys,

50
00:02:08,957 --> 00:02:13,837
I was willing to spend $10, 000
just a little...

51
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,381
...sip of this lemonade.

52
00:02:16,423 --> 00:02:17,757
Fifteen!

53
00:02:17,799 --> 00:02:20,385
But now I can spend
two hours in brutal heat

54
00:02:20,427 --> 00:02:22,429
with a cup of this
cold, refreshing lemonade

55
00:02:22,471 --> 00:02:24,181
and just pour it in the dirt.

56
00:02:24,222 --> 00:02:25,932
Ah, come on, Daniels!

57
00:02:25,974 --> 00:02:28,185
You ran Bear Stearns, 
for God's sake!

58
00:02:28,226 --> 00:02:29,353
I was like this.

59
00:02:29,394 --> 00:02:31,188
Just like this.

60
00:02:31,229 --> 00:02:33,231
Then I went to the desert
to seek answers,

61
00:02:33,273 --> 00:02:35,233
and now I have them.

62
00:02:35,275 --> 00:02:37,986
Actually, George Sr.
had come to the desert

63
00:02:38,028 --> 00:02:40,280
to escape questions.

64
00:02:40,322 --> 00:02:43,158
Years earlier, after duping
his twin brother Oscar...

65
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,202
- You gave me up, George.
- George? I'm not George.

66
00:02:45,243 --> 00:02:47,037
...into taking his place
at a party

67
00:02:47,078 --> 00:02:49,456
the family held
on the Queen Mary,

68
00:02:49,498 --> 00:02:51,749
George Sr. stowed away
with a son

69
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:53,502
who was also
fleeing the family.

70
00:02:53,542 --> 00:02:56,087
How was the party?

71
00:02:56,129 --> 00:02:57,546
Mom stole it.

72
00:02:57,588 --> 00:02:59,799
- The whole boat?
- She had.

73
00:02:59,841 --> 00:03:02,219
- As she fled to sea...
- Full steam, boys!

74
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,805
...a strategy
their lawyer's son came up with

75
00:03:05,847 --> 00:03:07,891
on his first day back in
the country after law school.

76
00:03:07,932 --> 00:03:09,434
I'm wondering if
we shouldn't have a plan

77
00:03:09,476 --> 00:03:11,061
in regards to bookkeeping,

78
00:03:11,102 --> 00:03:13,855
in case we accidentally
make a mistake or get caught.

79
00:03:13,897 --> 00:03:18,609
What if we were
to become a... an-an... an NLC?

80
00:03:18,651 --> 00:03:20,945
- Ooh!
- A "No Liability Corporation."

81
00:03:20,987 --> 00:03:22,989
We just have no liability, 
just nothing...

82
00:03:23,031 --> 00:03:26,034
Well, first of all, I would
avoid doing anything illegal.

83
00:03:26,076 --> 00:03:27,202
May I make a suggestion?

84
00:03:27,244 --> 00:03:29,454
- Sure.
- Take to the sea!

85
00:03:29,496 --> 00:03:31,248
Three miles out, 
and it's a free-for-all!

86
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:33,458
No rules, pirate radio laws.

87
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,627
Really!
Is this true, Mr. Zuckerkorn?

88
00:03:36,669 --> 00:03:38,296
Sure.

89
00:03:38,338 --> 00:03:40,340
So we will stick together
and have

90
00:03:40,382 --> 00:03:42,133
all of our meetings on boats.

91
00:03:42,175 --> 00:03:44,302
Well, uh, I don't know
if that's necessary.

92
00:03:44,344 --> 00:03:46,096
Yeah, because they don't have to
be together, because you can't

93
00:03:46,137 --> 00:03:47,722
try a husband and wife
for the same crime, right?

94
00:03:47,764 --> 00:03:49,474
Sure.

95
00:03:49,516 --> 00:03:51,809
We have the best
 attorneys.

96
00:03:51,851 --> 00:03:53,811
You think we should go back?

97
00:03:53,853 --> 00:03:56,064
Absolutely. She's your mother.

98
00:03:56,106 --> 00:03:57,524
Family has to stick together.

99
00:03:57,566 --> 00:03:59,234
You're afraid
she'll turn on you.

100
00:03:59,276 --> 00:04:01,486
Won't even leave the table
during a dinner party.

101
00:04:01,528 --> 00:04:02,695
Okay.

102
00:04:02,737 --> 00:04:04,448
We're going back, 
George Michael!

103
00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:07,325
It turned out, Lucille had
returned to shore, too.

104
00:04:07,367 --> 00:04:09,244
Why the alleged ship-jacker

105
00:04:09,286 --> 00:04:11,037
changed direction
is still unexplained.

106
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:13,290
And soon the family met up

107
00:04:13,331 --> 00:04:14,958
at the beginning
of a fourth season...

108
00:04:14,999 --> 00:04:16,834
- My wife, how is she?
- ...that would never come.

109
00:04:16,876 --> 00:04:18,503
She's fine. You're lucky
we didn't have an autumn,

110
00:04:18,545 --> 00:04:19,629
otherwise she'd be colder.

111
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:20,964
Look what they've done, George!

112
00:04:21,005 --> 00:04:23,216
Look what the homosexuals
have done to me.

113
00:04:23,258 --> 00:04:24,842
A joyride.

114
00:04:24,884 --> 00:04:26,803
That's what they decide to do
with the freedom

115
00:04:26,844 --> 00:04:28,305
this country has given them.

116
00:04:28,346 --> 00:04:30,098
That's the best alibi
I've been able

117
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,267
to come up with, because
our lawyer says he thinks

118
00:04:32,309 --> 00:04:34,811
he can get rid
of the SEC charges,

119
00:04:34,852 --> 00:04:37,772
but he's worried about
the pirating of theQueen Mary.

120
00:04:37,814 --> 00:04:39,732
Says they have
a suit against us.

121
00:04:39,774 --> 00:04:42,277
- Where is Barry?
- He's with the harbormaster.

122
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:45,238
He's trying to dazzle them
with a suit of his own.

123
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,198
Well, he hated the suit.

124
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,033
Thought I was making fun.

125
00:04:49,075 --> 00:04:52,412
But basically, this is
a "good news/bad news" deal.

126
00:04:52,454 --> 00:04:54,664
First of all, won't be cheap.

127
00:04:54,705 --> 00:04:56,874
It's gonna cost you
a fortune in legal fees.

128
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:58,918
- What's the good news?
- Oh, yeah.

129
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,587
Well, from your perspective, 
I can see where

130
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:01,879
you think it's all bad news.

131
00:05:01,921 --> 00:05:03,131
It's all bad news.

132
00:05:03,173 --> 00:05:04,382
Also, it turns out

133
00:05:04,424 --> 00:05:05,925
that stealing theQueen Mary

134
00:05:05,967 --> 00:05:07,427
comes under maritime law,

135
00:05:07,469 --> 00:05:09,720
which, I just found out, 
is an actual thing.

136
00:05:09,762 --> 00:05:10,763
It's a real thing.

137
00:05:10,805 --> 00:05:11,889
Don't you worry.

138
00:05:11,931 --> 00:05:12,932
We got three months

139
00:05:12,974 --> 00:05:14,392
to prepare for this hearing.

140
00:05:14,434 --> 00:05:17,020
And so, George Sr.
went to his competitor,

141
00:05:17,061 --> 00:05:18,855
Stan Sitwell, with an offer,

142
00:05:18,896 --> 00:05:21,650
so he could afford to cover
Lucille's high legal fees.

143
00:05:21,691 --> 00:05:24,444
Buy the rest of your stock?
You got to be kidding me.

144
00:05:24,486 --> 00:05:26,446
I already dumped the stock
I owned to Lucille Austero.

145
00:05:26,488 --> 00:05:28,031
Don't forget, 
I was on that boat.

146
00:05:28,072 --> 00:05:29,407
And believe me, I lost

147
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:31,493
more than just the 50 grand
on that sale.

148
00:05:31,535 --> 00:05:33,703
I also lost
a perfectly good pair of

149
00:05:33,744 --> 00:05:36,164
human chest hair nipple tufts
when we hit the water.

150
00:05:36,206 --> 00:05:38,707
Stan Sitwell
suffered from alopecia,

151
00:05:38,749 --> 00:05:40,293
a condition
that rendered him hairless.

152
00:05:40,335 --> 00:05:42,629
That's kelp;
why would I put it onto my chest

153
00:05:42,671 --> 00:05:44,130
or head or anywhere else?

154
00:05:44,172 --> 00:05:45,714
I was gonna
show those babies off

155
00:05:45,756 --> 00:05:47,676
- at the Jacuzzi after-party.
- Come on, Stan.

156
00:05:47,716 --> 00:05:49,302
I'm offering you
the chance to double

157
00:05:49,344 --> 00:05:51,224
- the size of your business.
- Way ahead of you.

158
00:05:51,262 --> 00:05:52,763
I've got a big project
coming up.

159
00:05:52,805 --> 00:05:54,641
And even you can't
compete for this one,

160
00:05:54,683 --> 00:05:55,724
with your business in the shape
that it's in.

161
00:05:55,766 --> 00:05:56,809
This is a biggie.

162
00:05:56,851 --> 00:05:57,977
I get this contract,

163
00:05:58,019 --> 00:05:59,563
and it gets government approval,

164
00:05:59,604 --> 00:06:01,147
I'll be bigger than Halliburton.

165
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:02,773
Well, maybe not Halliburton,

166
00:06:02,815 --> 00:06:04,234
but definitely Halliburton Teen.

167
00:06:04,275 --> 00:06:05,902
Halliburton Teen was a leading

168
00:06:05,943 --> 00:06:08,321
youth and lifestyle retailer, 
despite the fact

169
00:06:08,363 --> 00:06:13,243
that it was a rebranding
of the tarnished Halliburton.

170
00:06:13,284 --> 00:06:14,994
Penitentiary and
Rendition Systems.

171
00:06:15,036 --> 00:06:17,539
It's also how their
deep-water drilling enterprise

172
00:06:17,581 --> 00:06:19,666
spawned this company.

173
00:06:21,459 --> 00:06:22,919
Anyway, you're too late.

174
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,462
The contract is
practically mine.

175
00:06:24,504 --> 00:06:26,964
Even you can't underbid me.

176
00:06:27,006 --> 00:06:29,634
Well, you may have
a bigger business than me,

177
00:06:29,676 --> 00:06:32,596
but you will never have this.

178
00:06:32,637 --> 00:06:34,556
And believe me, 
I'm gonna find out

179
00:06:34,598 --> 00:06:36,933
that project you're working on, 
even if I have to search

180
00:06:36,974 --> 00:06:40,103
the public records
for the blueprints myself.

181
00:06:40,144 --> 00:06:41,730
Unless you search
in this office,

182
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,481
you will never find them.

183
00:06:50,614 --> 00:06:52,449
Oh... aah...!

184
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,743
Ow, my hair!
My beautiful hair!

185
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,664
My hair!
My beautiful hair!

186
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:03,627
This isn't what it looks like!

187
00:07:03,668 --> 00:07:05,128
Oh, really?

188
00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:08,632
Because it looks like a monument
to George W. Bush.

189
00:07:10,049 --> 00:07:12,385
Well, you got me.

190
00:07:12,427 --> 00:07:14,471
You're in for
a rude awakening, Sitwell.

191
00:07:14,512 --> 00:07:16,097
It'll never stand.

192
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:18,433
It's too thin.

193
00:07:18,475 --> 00:07:20,810
It'll never stand.

194
00:07:20,851 --> 00:07:23,020
You see, the W's
and the word "bush."

195
00:07:23,062 --> 00:07:24,773
I mean, what else could it be?

196
00:07:24,814 --> 00:07:28,318
You mean other than
a 20-foot-wide monument

197
00:07:28,359 --> 00:07:30,194
that goes five miles
into the sky?

198
00:07:30,236 --> 00:07:32,863
I know, I know. And I told him
it wouldn't stand,

199
00:07:32,905 --> 00:07:35,116
which I probably shouldn't have.

200
00:07:35,158 --> 00:07:38,703
It's a wall, George;
you're looking at it sideways.

201
00:07:38,745 --> 00:07:41,289
The W stands for "wall."

202
00:07:41,331 --> 00:07:42,499
The bushes...

203
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,000
Stand for the bushes.

204
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:46,336
Ah--this explains
the immigration booth

205
00:07:46,377 --> 00:07:48,129
10, 000 feet in the air.

206
00:07:48,171 --> 00:07:50,465
It's to separate
the U.S. and Mexico,

207
00:07:50,507 --> 00:07:52,717
to keep out the immigrants, 
which was my idea!

208
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:54,344
Was your idea. I remember.

209
00:07:54,385 --> 00:07:57,221
You said that right after
Lupe got the bleach stain

210
00:07:57,263 --> 00:07:58,723
on your teal blazer.

211
00:07:58,765 --> 00:08:00,850
How did you miss this, George?

212
00:08:00,891 --> 00:08:03,269
This is business we should have.

213
00:08:03,311 --> 00:08:06,105
Is this how you're going to
let it all end, as a failure?

214
00:08:06,147 --> 00:08:07,898
- Is that your plan?
- No.

215
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,609
Of course not.

216
00:08:09,651 --> 00:08:12,612
It was his plan.

217
00:08:15,365 --> 00:08:17,701
George Sr. felt
discouraged and alone...

218
00:08:17,742 --> 00:08:20,244
Bluth for two--I mean, one.

219
00:08:20,286 --> 00:08:21,912
I thought I already seated you.

220
00:08:21,954 --> 00:08:25,249
...when he saw a familiar face:
his own...

221
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:28,586
...on his twin brother Oscar.

222
00:08:28,628 --> 00:08:30,921
George!
Actually, we came in

223
00:08:30,963 --> 00:08:33,174
to use the bathroom, 
but they sat me.

224
00:08:33,216 --> 00:08:35,510
And they have mahimahi today.

225
00:08:35,552 --> 00:08:37,679
Will you join us?
Will you have a mahimahi on me?

226
00:08:37,721 --> 00:08:39,889
- On you.
- Fine, but I'm gonna

227
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:42,851
sit opposite you, 
so it won't look bad.

228
00:08:42,892 --> 00:08:45,061
These are my friends; we all
live in the desert together.

229
00:08:45,102 --> 00:08:48,105
This is Heartfire;
she's an aura specialist.

230
00:08:48,147 --> 00:08:49,232
She did Matthew Modine.

231
00:08:52,068 --> 00:08:53,444
I will.

232
00:08:53,486 --> 00:08:55,572
Heartfire would like
some more crackers.

233
00:08:55,613 --> 00:08:57,574
Oscar, you don't believe
that nonsense, do you?

234
00:08:57,615 --> 00:08:59,200
No, no, no. You're a skeptic.

235
00:08:59,242 --> 00:09:01,828
But I'll tell you something, 
the desert changes you.

236
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,913
Dr. Norman is
a disgraced anesthesiologist.

237
00:09:03,954 --> 00:09:05,039
Oh.

238
00:09:05,081 --> 00:09:06,666
The bigger crime would've been

239
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:08,626
the patient didn't wake up
and testify against me.

240
00:09:08,668 --> 00:09:11,003
But nobody cares about the part
of the oath he kept.

241
00:09:11,045 --> 00:09:12,338
I'll tell you this.

242
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,674
If that nastiness
had never happened,

243
00:09:14,716 --> 00:09:16,217
I never would've gotten
those prison pen pal letters

244
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:19,095
from the most beautiful woman
in the world.

245
00:09:19,136 --> 00:09:21,890
If he as bad as the
state of California say he is,

246
00:09:21,931 --> 00:09:24,809
then why did I fall in love
with him, huh?

247
00:09:24,851 --> 00:09:26,811
Yo,  the state
of California!

248
00:09:26,853 --> 00:09:28,020
'em!

249
00:09:28,062 --> 00:09:31,941
Bunch of
California , yeah.

250
00:09:31,982 --> 00:09:34,652
As you can imagine, 
her letters really stood out.

251
00:09:34,694 --> 00:09:36,404
Do you know China Garden?

252
00:09:36,446 --> 00:09:38,197
I know the downtown one.

253
00:09:38,239 --> 00:09:39,532
You know, I shouldn't judge.

254
00:09:39,574 --> 00:09:42,118
'Cause you have friends, 
and I...

255
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:43,536
I envy that.

256
00:09:43,578 --> 00:09:46,915
You're welcome
to my friends, brother.

257
00:09:50,167 --> 00:09:52,754
I don't want these.

258
00:09:52,796 --> 00:09:55,131
But perhaps due to
the absence of Lucille,

259
00:09:55,172 --> 00:09:58,259
the two brothers connected
as they hadn't in years.

260
00:09:58,301 --> 00:10:00,261
I'm not the big man
I thought I was.

261
00:10:00,303 --> 00:10:02,889
Forget the past, George.

262
00:10:02,931 --> 00:10:05,224
I don't know; maybe it's
because I live on the border

263
00:10:05,266 --> 00:10:07,351
between the United States
and Mexico and...

264
00:10:07,393 --> 00:10:09,228
Hold on. Border?

265
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,606
You don't think I live
like this all the time, do you?

266
00:10:11,648 --> 00:10:14,651
That's why I had so much fun
at that party on theQueen Mary.

267
00:10:14,692 --> 00:10:16,903
And you paid for my haircut.

268
00:10:16,945 --> 00:10:19,155
And you made me...
dress like you.

269
00:10:19,196 --> 00:10:20,740
Forget the past.

270
00:10:20,782 --> 00:10:24,661
What were you saying about
that property on the border?

271
00:10:24,702 --> 00:10:26,943
And that's when George Sr.
first saw the desert property.

272
00:10:26,955 --> 00:10:30,291
And the much smaller sweat
lodge that was on the land.

273
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,376
You live here?

274
00:10:32,418 --> 00:10:33,711
Ask him!

275
00:10:33,753 --> 00:10:35,755
Would you like
to watch us make love?

276
00:10:35,797 --> 00:10:36,923
No. You live here?

277
00:10:36,965 --> 00:10:38,508
We have been.

278
00:10:38,549 --> 00:10:41,135
You see, Mexico starts
right at the end of that gully,

279
00:10:41,177 --> 00:10:43,262
and we have to get
in and out of there

280
00:10:43,304 --> 00:10:44,931
so we can get at the maca root.

281
00:10:44,973 --> 00:10:46,599
What the hell is maca root?

282
00:10:46,641 --> 00:10:48,893
It's an ancient Aztec
power herb.

283
00:10:48,935 --> 00:10:50,144
It's an endocrine adaptogen.

284
00:10:50,186 --> 00:10:51,813
It's legal to grow in Mexico,

285
00:10:51,855 --> 00:10:53,940
but it's against the law
to consume it there.

286
00:10:53,982 --> 00:10:56,651
Of course, you can ingest it
here, but you can't grow it.

287
00:10:56,693 --> 00:10:59,654
And... you can bring it
into Mexico,

288
00:10:59,696 --> 00:11:02,239
but you can't bring it out.

289
00:11:02,281 --> 00:11:04,200
So it's, uh, hard.

290
00:11:04,241 --> 00:11:06,076
So you guys are knowingly
breaking the law?

291
00:11:06,118 --> 00:11:09,455
But it's worth it, because maca
has powerful properties,

292
00:11:09,497 --> 00:11:12,166
especially when combined with
an hour in the sweat lodge.

293
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:15,503
It gets up to 110 degrees
in there.

294
00:11:15,545 --> 00:11:17,045
Sounds fun.

295
00:11:17,087 --> 00:11:19,007
Oh, but you have to do it
with us.

296
00:11:19,047 --> 00:11:21,049
You'll find a power
you didn't know you had.

297
00:11:21,091 --> 00:11:23,887
But, um, you want to do it soon,

298
00:11:23,928 --> 00:11:28,182
because they're
kicking us off of the land.

299
00:11:28,224 --> 00:11:29,642
I'm sorry.

300
00:11:29,684 --> 00:11:31,561
Oh, great.
Now you're gonna make me cry.

301
00:11:31,602 --> 00:11:33,021
Oh, lizard! Look!
Look, a lizard!

302
00:11:33,061 --> 00:11:34,188
Cute!

303
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,857
What if I were to buy
this land?

304
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:37,984
I don't understand;
why would you want to do that?

305
00:11:38,026 --> 00:11:41,404
Well, I always talk about
being a great man.

306
00:11:41,445 --> 00:11:44,281
Maybe a way to do that is
not by being

307
00:11:44,323 --> 00:11:46,367
the biggest businessman in
Southern California, it's...

308
00:11:46,409 --> 00:11:50,038
It's by being the best brother
in Southern California.

309
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:51,956
George Sr. was going to say,

310
00:11:51,998 --> 00:11:54,417
"By gouging the government
when they needed the land..."

311
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:55,752
You bet.

312
00:11:55,793 --> 00:11:58,212
Hey, guys, we're staying.

313
00:11:58,254 --> 00:11:59,589
Oh, thank you, brother.

314
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,965
...but he'd save that
for Lucille.

315
00:12:01,007 --> 00:12:03,843
- Thank you, maca.
- Thank you, maca!

316
00:12:03,885 --> 00:12:05,469
And I can get this land
for a song.

317
00:12:05,511 --> 00:12:06,888
George was proud of his plan.

318
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,014
Are you listening to me?

319
00:12:08,056 --> 00:12:09,891
So are those cameras, George.

320
00:12:09,933 --> 00:12:11,350
We can't use the same cameras

321
00:12:11,392 --> 00:12:13,603
from when he was under
house arrest?

322
00:12:13,644 --> 00:12:15,688
These are from
the maritime penal system.

323
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:17,815
They make us use
the waterproof ones.

324
00:12:17,857 --> 00:12:19,358
- In here.
- Okay.

325
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,109
We're gonna sell that land

326
00:12:21,151 --> 00:12:22,612
to the government
for Sitwell's wall,

327
00:12:22,653 --> 00:12:24,238
and I'm gonna take the cash.

328
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,866
I am gonna mount a case
that shows that my wife

329
00:12:26,908 --> 00:12:28,868
is not the power-hungry monster

330
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:31,370
the SEC wants
to make her out to be.

331
00:12:31,412 --> 00:12:33,831
You're such a puny thinker.

332
00:12:33,873 --> 00:12:35,165
Am I puny-thinking again?

333
00:12:35,207 --> 00:12:36,459
Sitwell's wall?

334
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,461
How about our wall?
We build the wall.

335
00:12:38,502 --> 00:12:40,755
We do have the plan.

336
00:12:40,797 --> 00:12:42,799
He says he can build it
for $200 million,

337
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,926
we offer to build it
for $150 million,

338
00:12:44,968 --> 00:12:47,762
and we make up the difference
when we sell the land.

339
00:12:47,804 --> 00:12:51,682
And I use that cash
as a little stimulus for us.

340
00:12:51,724 --> 00:12:53,476
Maybe a little something
for the family.

341
00:12:53,517 --> 00:12:55,352
And we build that sucker...

342
00:12:55,394 --> 00:12:56,646
That's my Georgie!

343
00:12:56,687 --> 00:12:57,772
...five miles high.

344
00:12:57,814 --> 00:12:59,983
Long. Five miles long.

345
00:13:00,024 --> 00:13:03,527
I got nothing in my system
but a maca root cookie.

346
00:13:03,569 --> 00:13:05,488
So, that one's all set.

347
00:13:05,529 --> 00:13:07,281
Uh... can I put one up there?

348
00:13:07,323 --> 00:13:10,743
Only if you want to see the
sexiest video you've ever seen.

349
00:13:12,328 --> 00:13:15,414
Sorry I gave you
the old noodle stab in there.

350
00:13:15,456 --> 00:13:18,459
I needed
something in my system.

351
00:13:18,501 --> 00:13:21,462
You know, we can't look like
we're in cahoots on this.

352
00:13:21,504 --> 00:13:23,673
Especially with my trial
coming up.

353
00:13:23,714 --> 00:13:25,049
Yeah, that's right.

354
00:13:25,091 --> 00:13:27,135
We have to separate our assets.

355
00:13:27,175 --> 00:13:28,511
To protect this.

356
00:13:28,552 --> 00:13:31,221
To protect our love.

357
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,903
And that's
when they got the idea

358
00:13:32,932 --> 00:13:36,393
to pretend they were
getting a divorce.

359
00:13:36,435 --> 00:13:38,354
We're getting a divorce.

360
00:13:38,395 --> 00:13:40,064
I want to know about
the stimulus package.

361
00:13:40,106 --> 00:13:42,733
We haven't had sex
since Christmas, Michael!

362
00:13:42,775 --> 00:13:45,069
Uh... I'm... I'm sorry.

363
00:13:45,111 --> 00:13:47,947
You had sex seven weeks ago?

364
00:13:47,989 --> 00:13:50,992
They were remodeling my room, 
and I pulled my cot in there,

365
00:13:51,034 --> 00:13:53,327
- just like camp.
- We yelled at you to leave.

366
00:13:53,369 --> 00:13:55,210
Yeah, but then you whispered, 
"Don't pull out!"

367
00:13:57,205 --> 00:13:59,542
You didn't want to use
any of that money for...

368
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:04,505
You couldn't use any of that
money to finish Sudden Valley?

369
00:14:04,547 --> 00:14:06,632
And although their plan
was dealt a minor setback

370
00:14:06,674 --> 00:14:08,801
when Michael sold
the controlling shares

371
00:14:08,843 --> 00:14:10,928
to Lucille 2...

372
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,972
You know what?
I am done with this family.

373
00:14:13,014 --> 00:14:14,348
I hope you've saved some money,

374
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:16,308
'cause you're gonna need
every dime now.

375
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,727
...all they had to do

376
00:14:17,768 --> 00:14:19,520
was keep their plan
a secret from her

377
00:14:19,562 --> 00:14:21,022
and cash in quickly.

378
00:14:21,064 --> 00:14:23,191
4:28 in the morning
here in the O.C.

379
00:14:23,232 --> 00:14:24,775
I'm John Beard.

380
00:14:24,817 --> 00:14:26,861
Well, there was some more
grim economic news today.

381
00:14:26,903 --> 00:14:28,445
The housing prices
continue to plummet,

382
00:14:28,487 --> 00:14:30,531
and the economists say
it may take quite some--

383
00:14:30,573 --> 00:14:32,282
What are you...
what are you doing?

384
00:14:32,324 --> 00:14:35,285
I'm John Beard, 
and I'm a Gloomy Gus.

385
00:14:35,327 --> 00:14:36,954
I don't have a mustache.

386
00:14:36,996 --> 00:14:38,998
And the government
put the wall project on hold.

387
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,624
Can't be on hold.

388
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:43,044
They already gave me the money
to start the building.

389
00:14:43,086 --> 00:14:45,796
No! I cannot live off of that!

390
00:14:45,838 --> 00:14:49,133
No, I already used that money
as the down payment

391
00:14:49,175 --> 00:14:51,177
of six square miles of desert

392
00:14:51,219 --> 00:14:53,303
I cannot afford
to make payments on!

393
00:14:54,471 --> 00:14:56,933
Oh, God... sorry, Norman.

394
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,685
Huh?

395
00:14:59,727 --> 00:15:00,937
Uh, nothing.

396
00:15:00,978 --> 00:15:02,980
Hey, brother, you seem tense.

397
00:15:03,022 --> 00:15:04,481
Come with me to the sweat lodge.

398
00:15:04,523 --> 00:15:06,525
Sweat out this frustration;
you can learn on this.

399
00:15:06,567 --> 00:15:08,861
And perhaps
it was a sense of futility

400
00:15:08,903 --> 00:15:11,614
or the fact he hadn't
brought a book to the desert,

401
00:15:11,655 --> 00:15:16,452
but George Sr. chose to enter
the small, smoke-filled room,

402
00:15:16,493 --> 00:15:18,537
while his wife
was also confined

403
00:15:18,579 --> 00:15:20,372
to a smoke-filled room,

404
00:15:20,414 --> 00:15:23,333
having found a way around
both the building's strict

405
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:24,919
no-smoking policy...

406
00:15:27,171 --> 00:15:30,258
...and the fact that her ankle
monitor prevented her

407
00:15:30,299 --> 00:15:33,219
from approaching the balcony.

408
00:15:33,261 --> 00:15:36,388
So, anyways, I went down
to the club and I... I can't...

409
00:15:45,815 --> 00:15:48,109
My food was gone, I could...

410
00:15:48,151 --> 00:15:51,946
That restaurant, typically, 
has a really nice maitre d'...

411
00:16:01,789 --> 00:16:04,416
Can't really remember
the host's name,

412
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,627
but he was...
he was kind of in his 60s...

413
00:16:18,555 --> 00:16:20,683
I have to stop.

414
00:16:20,724 --> 00:16:23,519
I have to stop. So...

415
00:16:25,938 --> 00:16:27,815
But, finally, I just ordered...

416
00:16:27,857 --> 00:16:30,151
pastrami shortcake, like I said, 
but I didn't order...

417
00:16:30,193 --> 00:16:32,195
I didn't order sprinkles this--
Oh, Mother, please.

418
00:16:32,236 --> 00:16:33,737
Please.

419
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:36,406
Meanwhile, 
in George Sr.'s sweat lodge,

420
00:16:36,448 --> 00:16:39,660
a solution to his problems
was emerging, as well...

421
00:16:39,702 --> 00:16:41,370
Kind of hot, huh?

422
00:16:43,122 --> 00:16:46,416
I'd give $10, 000 for a glass
of lemonade right now.

423
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:48,585
...in the form of a vision.

424
00:16:50,546 --> 00:16:55,509
Sweat... and squeeze.

425
00:16:57,094 --> 00:16:59,263
It was to be
a "sweat and squeeze."

426
00:16:59,305 --> 00:17:00,681
Dr. Norman?

427
00:17:00,723 --> 00:17:03,267
Dr. Norman, we have a hot mess.

428
00:17:05,728 --> 00:17:07,188
George Sr. had been passed out

429
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:10,066
for two days
after having a vision...

430
00:17:10,107 --> 00:17:13,652
which is why this seat was
empty at his wife's trial.

431
00:17:13,694 --> 00:17:15,905
But soon, 
he was hard at work...

432
00:17:15,946 --> 00:17:18,157
Okay, look up large mud huts.

433
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:19,783
- ...making his vision a reality.
- Can fit 20.

434
00:17:19,825 --> 00:17:21,744
Do a something search.
Um, used is fine.

435
00:17:21,785 --> 00:17:24,121
No, no, I got it.

436
00:17:24,163 --> 00:17:25,164
Sweat caves.

437
00:17:25,206 --> 00:17:26,374
See what you get.

438
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:29,001
You got 'em?

439
00:17:29,043 --> 00:17:30,419
All right, well, then, ship it!

440
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,629
A sweat lodge, 
where he could be

441
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:36,592
a preacher of profit to other
type-A executives like himself.

442
00:17:36,633 --> 00:17:38,302
All right, this whole area here,

443
00:17:38,344 --> 00:17:40,721
this is going to be
visitor yurts.

444
00:17:40,763 --> 00:17:45,226
Oh, and we're gonna need
industrial-size juicers!

445
00:17:45,268 --> 00:17:47,353
He went to work
on constructing a seminar,

446
00:17:47,395 --> 00:17:50,064
much of which he borrowed
from his brief stint

447
00:17:50,106 --> 00:17:51,982
as a Jewish-y guru
while in prison.

448
00:17:52,024 --> 00:17:53,984
Now's your chance
to own the entire

449
00:17:54,026 --> 00:17:55,736
George Bluth
"Caged Wisdom" library...

450
00:17:55,778 --> 00:17:57,529
Will you read that back
to me, please?

451
00:17:57,571 --> 00:17:59,907
This time, however, he needed
to be actually ordained

452
00:17:59,949 --> 00:18:01,617
as a religious preacher
to avoid tax implications.

453
00:18:01,658 --> 00:18:03,286
Lemonade!

454
00:18:03,327 --> 00:18:05,537
But fortunately, there was
a Phoenix for him, too.

455
00:18:05,579 --> 00:18:07,206
Almost there. Question three.

456
00:18:07,248 --> 00:18:09,458
But business
really took off when

457
00:18:09,499 --> 00:18:12,378
an article about George Sr.'s
operation appeared

458
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:15,965
in an exclusively first-class
in-flight magazine.

459
00:18:16,006 --> 00:18:19,051
And soon the retreat was up
and running, and George Sr.

460
00:18:19,093 --> 00:18:20,886
was determined
to create the illusion

461
00:18:20,928 --> 00:18:23,555
of a first-class experience.

462
00:18:23,597 --> 00:18:26,434
And did you want the partial
bush or broken gate view?

463
00:18:26,516 --> 00:18:29,519
The seminar was
reasonably priced at $1, 000.

464
00:18:29,561 --> 00:18:31,814
The sweat and squeeze
was simple.

465
00:18:31,855 --> 00:18:35,359
First, George Sr. sweated out
his acolytes' defenses...

466
00:18:35,401 --> 00:18:36,735
Ah, come on, Daniels!

467
00:18:36,777 --> 00:18:38,862
You ran Bear Stearns, 
for God's sake!

468
00:18:38,904 --> 00:18:40,197
I was like this.

469
00:18:40,239 --> 00:18:42,532
Then I went to the desert
to seek answers,

470
00:18:42,574 --> 00:18:45,161
and now I have them.

471
00:18:45,202 --> 00:18:47,621
...and then it was time
for the squeeze.

472
00:18:47,663 --> 00:18:50,833
And for another 15 grand, 
you can have them, too.

473
00:18:50,874 --> 00:18:52,918
I'll teach you
how to get yachts,

474
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,545
I'll teach you how
to get penthouses,

475
00:18:55,587 --> 00:18:57,840
and how to get
something for yourself

476
00:18:57,881 --> 00:19:01,593
by taking it from someone
who thinks it's his.

477
00:19:01,635 --> 00:19:04,138
Does it come with lemonade?

478
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,182
It comes with all the lemonade
you can drink.

479
00:19:06,223 --> 00:19:07,141
"Squeeze" had two meanings.

480
00:19:07,183 --> 00:19:08,309
Who's in?

481
00:19:08,351 --> 00:19:11,228
Sign 'em up. Sign 'em up.

482
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:13,189
Come on, get your
wallets out, let's go, guys.

483
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:15,524
And George Sr.
had even found a great way

484
00:19:15,565 --> 00:19:18,361
- to handle the heat.
- Hey.

485
00:19:18,402 --> 00:19:19,695
Hey.

486
00:19:19,736 --> 00:19:21,280
He had his twin brother
endure it.

487
00:19:21,322 --> 00:19:23,073
Did you bring me some lemonade?

488
00:19:23,115 --> 00:19:26,035
No, sir.
It is crazy out there.

489
00:19:26,076 --> 00:19:28,745
For the first time we are out.

490
00:19:28,787 --> 00:19:31,540
Look what I brought you, 
Mr. Oscar--

491
00:19:31,581 --> 00:19:33,876
50 bucks--your half.

492
00:19:33,917 --> 00:19:36,879
Oh, you know, 
I feel bad taking this.

493
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,839
All I did was sit and sweat.

494
00:19:38,881 --> 00:19:40,257
Which is why it seemed

495
00:19:40,299 --> 00:19:42,134
that Father B. was so resilient

496
00:19:42,176 --> 00:19:46,222
to the depleting effects
of the sweat lodge.

497
00:19:48,391 --> 00:19:50,809
Whoo! Yeah!

498
00:19:50,851 --> 00:19:54,688
Now, that was the most
invigorating session yet.

499
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:59,527
Hey, buddy, come on, 
it's happening, you know.

500
00:19:59,568 --> 00:20:01,320
We're helping people.

501
00:20:01,362 --> 00:20:05,241
- - If I could give you
just one note, little energy.

502
00:20:05,282 --> 00:20:07,576
As the retreat grew,

503
00:20:07,617 --> 00:20:10,787
George Sr. was finding himself
emboldened with power,

504
00:20:10,829 --> 00:20:13,374
while Oscar was bushed.

505
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,584
Hey, Oscar, that scared me.

506
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:17,127
Come on, man, get back in there.

507
00:20:17,169 --> 00:20:18,670
I was starting to sweat.

508
00:20:18,712 --> 00:20:20,756
I'm just trying
to get my strength up.

509
00:20:20,797 --> 00:20:22,049
Maca usually gets me there.

510
00:20:22,091 --> 00:20:24,634
Hey, chew some maca with me.

511
00:20:24,676 --> 00:20:27,012
I can't, okay, I got to go up
to see Lucille tomorrow.

512
00:20:27,054 --> 00:20:28,556
George Sr. had been meeting

513
00:20:28,597 --> 00:20:31,725
with Lucille on a weekly basis
at her new home

514
00:20:31,767 --> 00:20:34,103
under the pretense
of working on their divorce.

515
00:20:34,144 --> 00:20:35,145
You look nice.

516
00:20:35,187 --> 00:20:36,397
Oh, stop trying to butter me up.

517
00:20:36,439 --> 00:20:38,315
Let's just get
this divorce agreed to

518
00:20:38,357 --> 00:20:39,816
so you can get out of here.

519
00:20:41,318 --> 00:20:42,570
Oh, God.

520
00:20:42,611 --> 00:20:43,653
It's almost
like adultery this way.

521
00:20:43,695 --> 00:20:45,364
Good, I like that.

522
00:20:45,406 --> 00:20:47,741
- "My wife doesn't understand me."
- My angel.

523
00:20:49,785 --> 00:20:53,122
"I haven't had an orgasm outside
of my bathtub in 30 years."

524
00:20:53,163 --> 00:20:55,541
How's that?

525
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:58,001
Although, at times,
I do wish it were darker.

526
00:20:58,043 --> 00:21:01,130
It's too bad you don't
have time to try this.

527
00:21:01,171 --> 00:21:02,798
Yesterday, 
I was talking to a lizard,

528
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:05,175
and it turned into
Elizabeth Taylor.

529
00:21:05,217 --> 00:21:07,428
- Young Elizabeth Taylor?
- Uh-huh.

530
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:09,054
Yeah, I could use some maca.

531
00:21:09,096 --> 00:21:10,556
Give me some of that.

532
00:21:10,598 --> 00:21:14,435
And soon a vision did appear.

533
00:21:14,477 --> 00:21:16,103
I don't know what's going on.

534
00:21:16,145 --> 00:21:20,107
For some reason I'm just getting
Richard Burton today.

535
00:21:20,149 --> 00:21:22,359
Oh, my God, what's that?

536
00:21:22,401 --> 00:21:23,735
That's the commode.

537
00:21:23,777 --> 00:21:25,195
Are you at all concerned
that the maca bush

538
00:21:25,237 --> 00:21:26,477
is directly downhill from that?

539
00:21:26,489 --> 00:21:28,115
He should have been,

540
00:21:28,157 --> 00:21:31,285
but Oscar was actually
referring to what now appeared

541
00:21:31,327 --> 00:21:35,205
to be a divine spirit, 
personified as an ostrich.

542
00:21:35,247 --> 00:21:37,249
You trespass on sacred ground.

543
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:39,627
The spirits command me
to warn you.

544
00:21:39,668 --> 00:21:42,546
You must leave this land
or the land will change you.

545
00:21:42,588 --> 00:21:44,465
Don't worry, he's probably

546
00:21:44,507 --> 00:21:46,800
from a local reservation.
I'll, I'll take care of this.

547
00:21:46,842 --> 00:21:50,971
How about you book me two nights
for Ray Romano at your casino?

548
00:21:51,013 --> 00:21:55,601
The strong will become the weak, 
the weak will become the strong.

549
00:21:55,643 --> 00:21:58,312
And get us close to the front
but not close enough

550
00:21:58,354 --> 00:22:00,397
that Ray talks to us.

551
00:22:00,439 --> 00:22:02,274
You have been warned.

552
00:22:04,151 --> 00:22:05,528
See ya.

553
00:22:07,237 --> 00:22:10,616
I don't know what you saw, but
I got an ostrich and no boner.

554
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,288
One year after George Sr. had

555
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:18,207
the incident
with the ostrich guy,

556
00:22:18,248 --> 00:22:20,167
things had indeed started
to change.

557
00:22:20,209 --> 00:22:21,710
Where was I? Um... oh, yeah.

558
00:22:21,751 --> 00:22:23,379
Father B. had lost his command
over the crowd.

559
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:26,756
Who would like some lemonade
for $2, 000?

560
00:22:27,966 --> 00:22:30,927
Come on, guys, 
I looked the other way

561
00:22:30,969 --> 00:22:33,055
on the bottled water
because you look thirsty,

562
00:22:33,096 --> 00:22:35,182
but you got to play along here.
Heartfire?

563
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,851
Where's the lemonade?

564
00:22:37,893 --> 00:22:39,562
Shh!

565
00:22:39,603 --> 00:22:42,481
And as business slowed down...

566
00:22:42,523 --> 00:22:43,482
Will you excuse me just one sec?

567
00:22:43,524 --> 00:22:44,941
...Oscar had started being

568
00:22:44,983 --> 00:22:47,528
more independent
and harder to find.

569
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:49,488
Norman, have you seen Oscar?

570
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:50,656
No, have you seen China Garden?

571
00:22:50,698 --> 00:22:51,657
No.

572
00:22:51,699 --> 00:22:52,991
Did you kill that armadillo?

573
00:22:53,033 --> 00:22:54,702
No, no, he's just under.

574
00:22:54,742 --> 00:22:57,621
If only we could use some of
his medicine for our own pain.

575
00:22:57,663 --> 00:23:01,667
Oh, wait, I've got
a full syringe in the car.

576
00:23:01,709 --> 00:23:03,544
And George Sr. would soon get

577
00:23:03,586 --> 00:23:05,087
worse economic news from
his attorney.

578
00:23:05,128 --> 00:23:06,589
Oh, this can't be good.

579
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:08,006
I mean, you didn't drive all

580
00:23:08,048 --> 00:23:09,508
this distance for good news.

581
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,051
You've got a balloon payment due

582
00:23:11,093 --> 00:23:12,969
on the mortgage
on this property.

583
00:23:13,011 --> 00:23:14,096
It's about $15 million.

584
00:23:14,137 --> 00:23:15,763
I mean, I-- what am I gonna do?

585
00:23:15,805 --> 00:23:17,391
Where am I gonna get that money?

586
00:23:17,433 --> 00:23:19,351
I thought you were going to sell
the land to the government

587
00:23:19,393 --> 00:23:20,686
to build the wall.

588
00:23:20,728 --> 00:23:22,062
Yeah, but that was put on hold.

589
00:23:22,104 --> 00:23:24,106
So?
It's election time.

590
00:23:24,147 --> 00:23:27,067
Now's the time to get a
politician to push for the wall.

591
00:23:27,109 --> 00:23:29,695
Isn't that dizzy kook
Lucille Austero running?

592
00:23:29,737 --> 00:23:31,447
No, no, she, 
she can't know about this.

593
00:23:31,488 --> 00:23:34,824
She's the majority owner
of my company,

594
00:23:34,866 --> 00:23:36,076
and besides, 
she's so pro-immigrant.

595
00:23:36,118 --> 00:23:37,703
She was.

596
00:23:37,745 --> 00:23:40,330
She'd even taken in
a Latino foster child,

597
00:23:40,372 --> 00:23:44,000
which she denied was an attempt
to bring in the Hispanic vote.

598
00:23:44,042 --> 00:23:46,336
Nonetheless, she did know what
cultural buttons to push

599
00:23:46,378 --> 00:23:48,088
to win their hearts.

600
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:49,839
Doesn't matter,
she's not going to win anyway.

601
00:23:49,881 --> 00:23:52,551
The guy you want is the guy
she's running against--

602
00:23:52,593 --> 00:23:54,177
Herbert Love, right?

603
00:23:54,219 --> 00:23:55,596
He's got a rally tonight.

604
00:23:55,638 --> 00:23:56,930
Go and see him.

605
00:23:56,972 --> 00:23:59,849
Everyone knows how persuasive
you can be.

606
00:23:59,891 --> 00:24:01,184
Used to be.

607
00:24:01,226 --> 00:24:03,395
I'd be lucky to sell
a glass of lemonade

608
00:24:03,437 --> 00:24:04,980
for a thousand dollars today.

609
00:24:05,021 --> 00:24:05,981
Now, listen.

610
00:24:06,022 --> 00:24:07,941
If I can take no more

611
00:24:07,983 --> 00:24:10,818
than a law degree
from the Virgin Islands...

612
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,405
- Yeah.
- ...a-a-and turn it into a net worth

613
00:24:13,447 --> 00:24:16,408
of $750, 000--

614
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:18,201
before, of course, 
what I owe in lawsuits--

615
00:24:18,243 --> 00:24:21,997
you can talk a politician into
wasting public funds on a wall.

616
00:24:22,038 --> 00:24:24,124
Wait, wait, 
that rally is tonight?

617
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:25,417
- Mm-hmm.
- But I'm supposed

618
00:24:25,459 --> 00:24:27,043
to meet my wife tonight,

619
00:24:27,085 --> 00:24:28,378
which I am dreading, by the way.

620
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,213
One of the changes

621
00:24:30,255 --> 00:24:32,174
that had occurred
over the previous year...

622
00:24:32,215 --> 00:24:34,802
- My right rear tire is low.
- ...was a decrease

623
00:24:34,842 --> 00:24:38,888
in the physical intimacy George
Sr. and his wife had enjoyed.

624
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:42,017
You're so ugly from behind.

625
00:24:44,269 --> 00:24:46,647
'Cause if no one
shows up at that office,

626
00:24:46,689 --> 00:24:48,440
she really will divorce me.

627
00:24:48,482 --> 00:24:50,066
Too bad you can't use a double.

628
00:24:50,108 --> 00:24:51,568
Oh, also I used a look-alike

629
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:54,530
named Stewart to take
the California bar for me.

630
00:24:54,571 --> 00:24:55,905
But you knew that, right?

631
00:24:58,158 --> 00:25:00,035
- Oscar.
- And later,

632
00:25:00,076 --> 00:25:02,538
while once again looking
for his own double...

633
00:25:02,579 --> 00:25:05,749
- Oscar.
- ...George, who was acting more like Oscar,

634
00:25:05,791 --> 00:25:08,711
finally found Oscar, who was
acting more like George.

635
00:25:08,752 --> 00:25:09,712
Why aren't you sweating?

636
00:25:09,753 --> 00:25:11,839
Maybe I had a better offer.

637
00:25:11,879 --> 00:25:14,090
And not a word to Dr. Norman.

638
00:25:14,132 --> 00:25:16,134
He doesn't think
women should be awake for it.

639
00:25:16,176 --> 00:25:18,094
"Oh, great Dr. Norman."

640
00:25:18,136 --> 00:25:20,972
You know, we have
to be very careful.

641
00:25:21,014 --> 00:25:23,183
Oscar, we are trying
to help people here.

642
00:25:23,225 --> 00:25:25,394
I know, I know, I know, 
but you know what?

643
00:25:25,435 --> 00:25:29,189
It just gets hot
in there sometimes!

644
00:25:29,231 --> 00:25:31,983
Whoa, we don't, 
we don't have to yell.

645
00:25:32,025 --> 00:25:35,738
Why not you go do hot sweat, 
let Oscar do squeeze?

646
00:25:35,779 --> 00:25:37,698
All right, I mean, 
I'm not saying that.

647
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,409
I just, uh, I need a break.

648
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:42,160
I just can't go on

649
00:25:42,202 --> 00:25:45,664
- pretending to be you, sitting silently...
- Shh.

650
00:25:45,706 --> 00:25:49,251
...in a, in a 100-degree mud hut
for an hour and a half.

651
00:25:49,292 --> 00:25:52,170
I am begging you--
there has to be something else

652
00:25:52,212 --> 00:25:55,298
I can impersonate you doing.

653
00:25:57,718 --> 00:25:59,469
It's funny you should say that

654
00:25:59,511 --> 00:26:03,599
because, uh, if you're okay
with the sitting silently part,

655
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,601
I have something for you
that's quite chilling.

656
00:26:05,642 --> 00:26:07,977
- Thank you.
- And so George Sr. left

657
00:26:08,019 --> 00:26:10,689
to seek out the right-wing
politician Herbert Love

658
00:26:10,731 --> 00:26:14,693
as Oscar headed out to visit
Lucille, disguised as George,

659
00:26:14,735 --> 00:26:16,570
which is exactly
who Barry thought

660
00:26:16,612 --> 00:26:18,280
he was talking to.

661
00:26:18,321 --> 00:26:20,156
I just pooped in a hole
and covered it up.

662
00:26:20,198 --> 00:26:21,909
I hope I did the right thing.

663
00:26:21,949 --> 00:26:23,535
There's a commode.

664
00:26:23,577 --> 00:26:25,287
It's, it's directly uphill
from the maca root.

665
00:26:25,328 --> 00:26:27,539
Yeah, I really feel bad
for the guy that's got

666
00:26:27,581 --> 00:26:30,125
to dig that up
for the foundation for the wall.

667
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,504
Yeah, wha-what wall?

668
00:26:35,505 --> 00:26:37,006
Very good, George.

669
00:26:37,048 --> 00:26:39,802
We got to be careful
where we talk about this.

670
00:26:39,843 --> 00:26:41,845
Ooh, I got to watch my words.

671
00:26:41,887 --> 00:26:44,514
And that's when
Oscar realized that George Sr.

672
00:26:44,556 --> 00:26:46,266
didn't buy the land

673
00:26:46,308 --> 00:26:50,353
to be the best brother
in Southern California.

674
00:26:53,022 --> 00:26:57,193
We 12publishes
a rare retraction.

675
00:26:57,235 --> 00:27:00,489
Oscar confirms his suspicions
of the wall

676
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:01,730
while impersonating George Sr.

677
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,366
I thought we...

678
00:27:03,408 --> 00:27:05,577
I thought
we could talk about the wall.

679
00:27:06,578 --> 00:27:08,872
You know, the wall.

680
00:27:08,914 --> 00:27:10,791
Have you baked your brain
in that pizza oven,

681
00:27:10,833 --> 00:27:12,334
or is senility your backup plan

682
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:14,962
if we can't get the government
to buy the property?

683
00:27:15,002 --> 00:27:17,756
So we only did buy
that land for personal gain.

684
00:27:17,798 --> 00:27:20,884
Well,  what Oscar does-doesn't know

685
00:27:20,926 --> 00:27:22,051
won't hurt him.

686
00:27:22,093 --> 00:27:23,428
Oscar.

687
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:24,596
And although it wasn't

688
00:27:24,638 --> 00:27:26,264
a perfect impersonation...

689
00:27:26,306 --> 00:27:28,057
I love it when you call my name.

690
00:27:28,099 --> 00:27:29,351
...he did have the maca root.

691
00:27:29,392 --> 00:27:31,269
George!

692
00:27:31,311 --> 00:27:32,479
Don't call me that.

693
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,023
Call me Father B.

694
