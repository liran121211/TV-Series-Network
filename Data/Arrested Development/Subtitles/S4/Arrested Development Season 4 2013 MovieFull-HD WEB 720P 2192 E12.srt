00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,950
<i>High school seniors</i>
<i>often find themselves</i>

2
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,950
<i>in their first relationship.</i>

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,040
How was that?

4
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,290
Perfecto.

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,290
<i>This is Maeby Funke,</i>

6
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:23,840
<i>and during her senior year,</i>
<i>she was dating this boy.</i>

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,880
<i>His name was Perfecto Telles,</i>

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,670
<i>and she was rewarding him</i>
<i>for doing her English homework,</i>

9
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,970
<i>even though English was</i>
<i>his second language.</i>

10
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:34,560
And if you do my Spanish,
I'll teach you how to French.

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,770
<i>Everyone could see that</i>
<i>they had chemistry together,</i>

12
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,480
<i>but it wasn't until</i>
<i>Donny Richter's algebra class</i>

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,980
<i>that the real bonding began.</i>

14
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,110
Okay, I don't want
to embarrass anyone,

15
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,150
so, everyone, close your eyes,
close 'em.

16
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:48,900
Now, if you passed the test,
go ahead and get up

17
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,320
and exit the classroom.

18
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,370
Does that include the crew?

19
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,660
No, the "Babies Having
Babies" crew...

20
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,040
- 38.
- Oh, 43,

21
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,580
but that's because
I'm good with numb...

22
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,330
Oh, no, actually it's 34.

23
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:00,960
Well, if it's dumb
to stay behind

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,170
with you, call me a dummy.

25
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,920
We don't say "dummy,"

26
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,420
and unfortunately
you two alge-tards

27
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:10,090
are going to need some
special tutoring.

28
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:11,340
<i>Which is how they found</i>
<i>themselves</i>

29
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,180
<i>headed to the local college,</i>

30
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,470
<i>along with the other</i>
<i>math-challenged students.</i>

31
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,180
♪ Take one down,
pass it around ♪

32
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,440
♪ ...bottles of beer
on the wall... ♪

33
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,980
Hey, when we get there, don't
forget you're Perfecto's woman.

34
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,360
I don't want to hear
about some smooth college guy

35
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,690
who stole you away from me.

36
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,030
Are you kidding me?

37
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,320
What kind of loser spends
his free time

38
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,860
tutoring high school kids?

39
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,370
<i>- This kind.</i>
- Hey, you must be...

40
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:36,160
What?

41
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,120
George Michael?

42
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,330
Huh, what is this?

43
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,870
Maeby, what are you doing here?

44
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,670
As I live and breathe, I...

45
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,960
I thought you were the girl. I'm
supposed to tutor a kid from...

46
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,340
High school, yeah, that's me.

47
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,340
Crazy, that is just crazy.

48
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:55,010
But, wait, why are you
in high school?

49
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:57,640
Didn't we graduate together
five years ago?

50
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,220
<i>It was a decent question.</i>

51
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:01,850
<i>After all,</i>
<i>it had been several years</i>

52
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,560
<i>since the two high school</i>
<i>seniors got somewhat intimate.</i>

53
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,230
You might not even be
related to us.

54
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,150
<i>But later,</i>
<i>while fleeing the boat party,</i>

55
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:13,240
<i>George Michael got some advice</i>
<i>on the matter from his father.</i>

56
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,780
She might not be
a blood relative,

57
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,950
but she is still family.

58
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:21,870
<i>So, after returning, worn from</i>
<i>the harsh winds of the sea,</i>

59
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,370
<i>George Michael found the girl</i>

60
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,210
<i>he now had to back away from</i>
<i>on her back.</i>

61
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,750
- Maeby, are you okay?
What are you doing? - Shh-shh.

62
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:30,090
I'm trying to get my parents
to notice me.

63
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:32,470
- I've been here for, like, an
hour and a half. - It's not me.

64
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,340
<i>- It had been seven minutes.</i>
- Do you think it would help

65
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,140
if I went over and said, like,
"Hey, Maeby's dead"?

66
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,140
- No, that would just mean
that they notice you. - Well,

67
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,220
obviously they've just got
a lot on their plate right now.

68
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,980
I mean, they're clearly busy.

69
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,190
♪ No, it's just
a phallus... eee! ♪

70
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,560
- Where's that from?
- It's from nothing.

71
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,980
- Why don't you cough
or something? - Oh, right,

72
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,610
like I'm dying.

73
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,570
There's nothing
keeping us together.

74
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,860
I believe
we're thinking the same thing.

75
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,080
Oh, God.

76
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,410
But, you know, I'm actually--

77
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,540
I'm glad to have
a moment alone with you,

78
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,910
because it gives us a chance
to talk about us.

79
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,620
You know, I really care
about you.

80
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,830
Oh, boy, here we go.

81
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,340
You want to get more serious.

82
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,550
<i>And Maeby didn't, because--</i>

83
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,590
<i>and I never</i>
<i>told you this, but--</i>

84
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:17,630
<i>George Michael wasn't</i>
<i>a very good kisser.</i>

85
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,390
<i>It seems</i>
<i>he both used his tongue</i>

86
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,470
<i>to fend off</i>
<i>the intruding tongue,</i>

87
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:24,430
<i>but also laterally moved</i>
<i>his lower jaw</i>

88
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,640
<i>while constricting</i>
<i>his lower lip.</i>

89
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:29,190
<i>The upper lip, meanwhile,</i>
<i>tended to retract,</i>

90
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:33,030
<i>revealing an exposed area from</i>
<i>the front teeth to the canines,</i>

91
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:36,860
<i>ultimately creating</i>
<i>more pain than pleasure.</i>

92
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,490
<i>Really just rookie mistakes,</i>

93
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:41,330
<i>but all of it conspired</i>
<i>to make Maeby concerned</i>

94
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,740
<i>about him wanting</i>
<i>to get more serious.</i>

95
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,210
- No, less serious.
- What?

96
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,420
Well, my dad doesn't think
that it's such a good idea

97
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,420
for you and me to be together.

98
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,630
And that doesn't make me
hotter to you?

99
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:55,050
No, I could see
that argument, I-I...

100
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:56,550
No, I think we should
just be cousins.

101
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,970
So first my parents don't notice
that I drowned,

102
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,430
and now my cousin doesn't care

103
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:03,310
that I'm at the height
of my sexuality.

104
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:06,180
No, sure I care, and, you know,
I'm right there with you.

105
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:08,600
We're a couple of, uh,
forces of nature, but...

106
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,110
- What?
- Forces of nature.

107
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,900
But I just really need to focus
on graduating right now,

108
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,610
and maybe you should, too,
you know.

109
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,990
Maybe that's the best way to get
your parents' attention.

110
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:21,370
That's a great idea.

111
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:24,030
I've got two whole months
to flunk.

112
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,870
That's got to disappoint them.

113
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,580
<i>Now the story of a family</i>

114
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,120
<i>whose future</i>
<i>was abruptly canceled,</i>

115
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,590
<i>and the one daughter</i>
<i>who had no choice</i>

116
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,750
<i>but to keep her life together.</i>

117
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,890
<i>It's Maeby's</i>
"Arrested Development."

118
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:45,680
<i>Maeby was trying</i>
<i>to get her parents</i>

119
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,770
<i>to notice she was flunking...</i>

120
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:50,270
So, for some reason they didn't
send me a cap and gown,

121
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,230
and I was gonna make one
out of sheets,

122
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,110
but I couldn't find...

123
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,650
<i>...only to discover</i>
<i>that Maeby's graduation wasn't</i>

124
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:57,860
<i>top-of-mind for her parents.</i>

125
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,740
They left town.

126
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:04,330
<i>So she put her plan to put her</i>
<i>graduation on hold on hold...</i>

127
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,830
- No, we do not need any extras.
<i>- ...and headed off to India,</i>

128
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,870
<i>where she'd be working</i>
<i>at what was once</i>

129
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,500
<i>just her after-school job.</i>

130
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,540
Right. Okay, do we have
to pay them in money or in rice?

131
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,710
If they're in the union,
you have to pay with rice.

132
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,670
<i>The movie she was supervising</i>
<i>was the latest</i>

133
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,590
<i>in her "terrifying grandmother"</i>

134
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:24,890
<i>"Gangie" franchise,</i>
<i>this one taking place in India.</i>

135
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,510
All right, I say we get
10,000 extras,

136
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,430
- and then that way we have it.
- We have it.

137
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,270
- Yeah, we have it.
- It's good to have it.

138
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:32,140
I am going to start
wearing this back home.

139
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,440
You'd think
someone would tell her

140
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,860
to shave her arms,
the poor thing.

141
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,150
<i>And soon,</i>
<i>she and her team arrived</i>

142
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,480
<i>and headed off to the hotel...</i>

143
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:38,860
- Wait, how is it pronounced?
- "Gan-jeez."

144
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,990
<i>Gangie on the Ganges?</i>

145
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:41,860
That doesn't even make sense.

146
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,070
<i>...where she found out</i>
<i>why her mother wasn't at</i>

147
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,780
<i>the graduation</i>
<i>that Maeby also wasn't not at.</i>

148
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,160
You don't get it.

149
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,080
I'm not used
to third world hotels.

150
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,460
No, you don't get it--
you are so full of (bleep).

151
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,500
Oh, you have got to be
kidding me.

152
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,670
Do we have a hair
and makeup crew with us?

153
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:00,010
Pretty makeup or scary makeup?

154
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,510
Scary.

155
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,380
Well, I think we have
the crew that did

156
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,050
<i>The Real Housewives</i>
<i>of Beverly Hills.</i>

157
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,800
Perfect.

158
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:09,470
<i>And that's how Lindsay</i>
<i>ended up receiving</i>

159
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,270
<i>- this spiritual advice.</i>
- I'm so full of passion.

160
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,730
You are so full of (bleep).

161
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,100
Yeah, yeah.

162
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,310
Pull your head out of the sand.

163
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,690
Love is where you left it.

164
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:20,740
The only person back home
is Tobias.

165
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,360
You have no children?

166
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,240
No. Why do you ask?

167
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,240
Well, yes, a daughter.

168
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,780
She's away at boarding school
in England.

169
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:32,710
- Is that where we left it?
<i>- Although you'd think this</i>

170
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,000
<i>- would have given her away.</i>
- Hug?

171
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,250
Please don't squeeze the shaman.

172
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:39,590
<i>And while it did bring</i>
<i>the family back together...</i>

173
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,920
Stop with the prayer hands.

174
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,590
It just looks like
you're out of ideas.

175
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,930
<i>...it did make it harder</i>
<i>for Maeby to make</i>

176
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,590
<i>this insult stick.</i>

177
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,390
Don't you think it makes
you seem a little, um,

178
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:51,850
what is that saying,
full of (bleep)?

179
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:54,440
Thank you, Maeby, that's
actually a compliment in India.

180
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,520
- My own fault. - I'm here
because a shaman told me

181
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,810
that love is where I left it.

182
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,900
<i>But soon, the Funkes took</i>
<i>their new spirit of love</i>

183
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:04,570
<i>and togetherness into a place</i>
<i>where they would seldom run</i>

184
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,700
<i>into each other,</i>
<i>and Maeby enrolled...</i>

185
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,740
- Okay, going back to school.
<i>- ...in a new high school</i>

186
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,030
<i>- for her senior year...</i>
- Senior year!

187
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,410
No? No one cares?

188
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:15,710
This is usually
a tough time for teens.

189
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,130
This is when drugs
often become an issue.

190
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:20,090
<i>...to see if her parents</i>
<i>would notice</i>

191
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:21,880
<i>she should have</i>
<i>already graduated.</i>

192
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,420
Time for babies having babies!

193
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,550
Is "Babies Having Babies" on?

194
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:28,680
That's my favorite show. Ow.

195
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,930
Mother's Day Eve was the most
joyous day of the year.

196
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,810
Maeby, you're going
to be late for school.

197
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:38,310
<i>And although they did share</i>
<i>one Thanksgiving together...</i>

198
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:40,650
It's not on.

199
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:42,320
<i>...they didn't realize</i>
<i>they were doing so...</i>

200
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,150
Why would they preempt
"Babies Having Babies"

201
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,700
for a turkey cartoon?

202
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,610
<i>...having celebrated it</i>
<i>one week earlier</i>

203
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,700
<i>when they found that duck</i>
<i>in the cupboard,</i>

204
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,040
<i>tried to cook it alive,</i>
<i>got scared, and then</i>

205
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,120
<i>ended up eating it</i>
<i>at a Chinese restaurant.</i>

206
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,910
<i>Okay, yeah,</i>
<i>we cook duck for you.</i>

207
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,830
<i>Nonetheless, Maeby was</i>
<i>doing well in school</i>

208
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,630
<i>and might have graduated</i>
<i>had this not happened.</i>

209
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:04,340
Look, I'm sorry, Tobias,

210
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,920
but we're trying
to save something

211
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,090
that just couldn't be saved.

212
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,300
Can you delete this so I can
leave a message for Maeby?

213
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,300
Lindsay, I have met someone.

214
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,430
It's not important who it is.

215
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,890
Erase this message,
and I'll leave her a mess...

216
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:21,610
Maeby, honey, Daddy has
insisted on raising you alone.

217
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:23,940
<i>But at least</i>
<i>her father was choked up.</i>

218
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,690
Maeby, your daddy's

219
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,570
not going to be around anymore.

220
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,660
Excuse me,
I swallowed a bug there.

221
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,200
Uh, your daddy's not going
to be around anymore.

222
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,950
This is the Widow Carr,

223
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:36,040
and for some reason,
it's my job to tell you that,

224
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,830
since you never made payment,
your house is being foreclosed.

225
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,210
Also, Tobias, you got a callback

226
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,420
for something called
"The Big Bang Theory."

227
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,250
<i>Having lost her parents</i>

228
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:46,920
<i>and her house, Maeby stopped</i>
<i>bothering with high school,</i>

229
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,800
<i>skipped her grandmother's</i>
<i>trial, and headed to L.A.</i>

230
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,850
<i>She now had to make sure</i>
<i>that she had an income.</i>

231
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,560
- Guess what. I'll just tell you.
- What?

232
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,350
- Yeah. - 'Cause I feel
like we'll be here forever,

233
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,560
and I have a meeting.
Um, you're fired.

234
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,940
- Why? - Well, because you don't
have a high school diploma,

235
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,730
and we have
a very strict policy here

236
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:04,940
that everyone has to have a
high school diploma, on account

237
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,150
of the fact
that Ron never graduated.

238
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,490
- Is this really happening?
- Actually, I was thinking

239
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:10,070
I wasn't even gonna
have to fire you

240
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,160
'cause it's been
on Deadline all day.

241
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,490
<i>How did they find out?</i>

242
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:14,580
<i>Does it even matter anymore?</i>

243
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,620
<i>Yeah, it does.</i>

244
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,910
I told them.

245
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,450
<i>With no parents, no job,</i>

246
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,040
<i>and no place to live,</i>
<i>Maeby had squat,</i>

247
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,630
<i>which is exactly what</i>
<i>she decided to do...</i>

248
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,130
What?

249
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:25,540
<i>...at her</i>
<i>grandparents' penthouse.</i>

250
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,170
<i>And that's when Maeby did</i>

251
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:28,510
<i>what we</i>
<i>in the entertainment industry</i>

252
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:31,510
<i>- call "deadlining."</i>
- Come on.

253
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:33,470
What do you think?

254
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,470
<i>On the plus side,</i>
<i>each parent thought</i>

255
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,220
<i>- she was with the other.</i>
- And we're not moving in;

256
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,680
we're occupying a space
with central air.

257
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,310
<i>So Maeby was as free</i>
<i>as that bird.</i>

258
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:43,810
Cindy, you okay?

259
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,610
All right, this will be
where she goes.

260
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:48,150
<i>So she retreated to</i>
<i>the long abandoned model home,</i>

261
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:51,860
<i>where she discovered</i>
<i>it's a lot harder to get out</i>

262
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:55,160
<i>of a Bluth home than into one.</i>

263
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,580
Pieces of (bleep).

264
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,200
<i>And maybe it was because</i>

265
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,540
<i>she had never fully</i>
<i>disappointed her parents,</i>

266
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:05,290
<i>and they were getting older,</i>
<i>or perhaps it was because</i>

267
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:06,670
<i>there was no Internet</i>
<i>at the model home...</i>

268
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:09,840
That is it-- this is like
living in 1999.

269
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,880
<i>...but that's when Maeby became</i>
<i>a high school senior</i>

270
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,680
<i>for the third time,</i>
<i>and then a fourth,</i>

271
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,760
<i>and then it just</i>
<i>sort of became what she did.</i>

272
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:22,270
<i>And it ultimately led to this.</i>

273
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:24,390
So I'm still going to stay
in high school

274
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,770
until they notice me.

275
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:27,190
You know, just, like,
let them think,

276
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,440
"Oh, no, should we be worried?

277
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,070
- Is she really that immature?"
- Yeah.

278
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,900
Well, I mean, isn't it, uh,

279
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,530
kind of a little immature

280
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:36,700
to try and make
your parents worry like that?

281
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,660
Oh, that's good-- I'm gonna try
and work that in there.

282
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,160
Yeah-- no, I think
it's in there.

283
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,830
Yeah, well,
let's get you in here before

284
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,410
our-our third roommate shows up.
That's Paul Haun.

285
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,540
Hi. So there's three people
who live in here?

286
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,540
Yeah, well, one guy
is just kind of crashing here.

287
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,590
- Well, it can't be worse than
living with your dad. - It's not.

288
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,210
No, it's not worse than that.

289
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,920
<i>And later,</i>

290
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,220
<i>- she was joined by her uncle.</i>
- Hello.

291
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,470
Didn't say it was your cousin.

292
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:00,560
Now, that's smart, let him think
there's a girl in here.

293
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,970
Yeah, we were just complaining
about roommates.

294
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,770
P-Hound.

295
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,730
I thought it was the other one.

296
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,810
No, it-it was P-Hound, yeah.

297
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,820
He's the worst. See, I think if
George Michael and I didn't have

298
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,990
each other as roommates,
we'd be going crazy.

299
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:17,110
<i>And for a moment, Maeby felt</i>
<i>superior to her cousin--</i>

300
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,200
<i>- and her uncle for that matter.</i>
- Actually,

301
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,950
have you told her
about your software?

302
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,040
No, software?

303
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,200
He's got this privacy software.

304
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,660
Keeps people from stealing
your stuff-- tell her, pal.

305
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:28,670
<i>Maeby tried</i>
<i>to hide her jealousy.</i>

306
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:31,420
So it's privacy software
that's also antipiracy?

307
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,010
Do you have a way of doing this?

308
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:35,760
Well, it's just a Boolean-driven
aggregation, really,

309
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,930
of what programmers call
"hacker-traps..."

310
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:40,140
<i>But as she listened</i>
<i>to her cousin discuss</i>

311
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:43,810
<i>computer technology</i>
<i>she had no understanding of,</i>

312
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:47,270
<i>she lost that feeling</i>
<i>of superiority,</i>

313
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,810
<i>and her self-esteem plummeted</i>

314
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,980
<i>as she started</i>
<i>to question the entirety</i>

315
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,150
<i>of what she had done</i>
<i>with her life</i>

316
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:54,900
<i>for the last several years.</i>

317
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:58,150
...and they want to steal
your music and copy your movies

318
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,200
or-or just look at your photos--
you know, this prevents that.

319
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,700
It just neutralizes that
so it's not even a threat.

320
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,160
It's called Fakeblock.

321
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,750
- Great name.
- Yeah, well, you know, it's

322
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,710
super low-hanging fruit.
Someone's gonna do it.

323
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,380
We're just trying
to be those guys, you know.

324
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,840
I don't understand
a word of it, but it works.

325
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,130
You should see
his Facebook page.

326
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:14,880
Doesn't have a friend on it.

327
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,670
<i>Of course, that last part</i>

328
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,930
<i>had nothing to do with</i>
<i>Fakeblock...</i>

329
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,640
Thank you, Dad.

330
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,470
<i>...but it did help</i>
<i>George Michael's self-esteem.</i>

331
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:27,520
<i>Maeby was feeling discouraged</i>

332
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,310
<i>as she got back on the bus</i>
<i>for high school.</i>

333
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:32,230
Hey, you want to get high
with us behind the gym?

334
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,650
Wait, we don't know her.

335
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,280
I hear there's an undercover cop
at school.

336
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,860
Can you imagine
what kind of loser pretends

337
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,030
to be in high school
when they're in their 20s?

338
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,490
Well, it's pretty gutsy, right?

339
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:43,240
I mean, it's better
to take the risk, right?

340
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,200
- Yeah, maybe you're right.
- Yeah, maybe you're right.

341
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,120
Cop.

342
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,500
Hey, how was your tutor?
He's not gonna

343
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,670
take you away from me, is he?

344
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:51,750
Well, not until
his software hits

345
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,630
and he can buy me an apartment.

346
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,170
I'm living in a (bleep)hole.

347
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,550
I hear they're hiring
at Chipotle.

348
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,510
<i>And that's when Maeby realized</i>

349
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:01,380
<i>maybe she should have graduated</i>
<i>high school.</i>

350
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:02,760
Can I get a Macallan 12 neat?

351
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,060
- Water back.
- I.D.?

352
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,640
Actually, can we make it--
uh, marry me--

353
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,890
a Wild Turkey?

354
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:10,270
I still need to see some I.D.

355
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:12,270
- Right. There you go.
- Thank you.

356
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:14,060
I'm supposed to believe
you're 17?

357
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,650
Oh, no, sorry.

358
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:17,690
That's my fake for sneaking
back into high school.

359
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,110
Here we go-- 23.

360
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,860
Oh, you're Maeby.
Well, you can have one,

361
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,450
but you got quite a bar tab.

362
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,240
I got to graduate.

363
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,120
I mean, I got to start bringing
some cash in, you know.

364
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,000
- Yeah.
- Everyone's just passing me by.

365
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,120
George Michael, Kitty Sanchez.

366
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:34,000
Drinks for the house.

367
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,500
This guy?

368
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,130
These guys are making
a fortune off that

369
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:38,800
"To Entrap a Local Predator"
show they're on.

370
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,920
Were.

371
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:41,420
Won't let us shoot in Laguna.

372
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:43,890
Are you guys looking
for a new bait house?

373
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:45,260
<i>And that's how</i>
<i>she made enough money</i>

374
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,430
<i>to at least pay</i>
<i>for her bar tab.</i>

375
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,600
Hey, guys.

376
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,100
- Hey, Perfecto!
- Hey.

377
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,770
Isn't this guy a little
too young to be in here?

378
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,810
No, no, no, he's with us.

379
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,560
<i>But later, when returning</i>
<i>from the restroom,</i>

380
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,770
<i>- she noticed this.</i>
- So, you fitting in

381
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,780
- over there at the high school?
- He's a cop.

382
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,990
They accepting you?

383
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,660
<i>And as she returned to the</i>
<i>high school for eighth period,</i>

384
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,330
<i>even getting a diploma</i>
<i>seemed to be in jeopardy.</i>

385
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:10,290
Barry?

386
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:12,210
Maeby, you scared
the be-(bleep) out of me.

387
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,120
What are you doing here?

388
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,540
Well, I could ask you
the same thing.

389
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,250
I go to high school here.

390
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,750
I could answer the same thing.

391
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,300
I was just looking
for something more believable.

392
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,670
Speaking of believable,
I was going to ask you

393
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,840
a question about that.

394
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,050
Um, can somebody get kicked out

395
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,720
of high school
if they're too old?

396
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,350
I think I was made at a bar.

397
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,930
I know this part of the law
very, very well.

398
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,560
After 21, it is illegal
for you to enroll

399
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,730
in high school
in the state of California.

400
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:38,070
As a matter of fact,
you cannot even lurk.

401
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,400
"Lurk."

402
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,780
What, do they got
cameras in the bushes?

403
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,740
Why would they do that?
You can't even

404
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,400
see into the locker rooms
from there.

405
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,950
Okay, so what do I do?
Because the guy who caught me

406
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,910
- goes to school with me.
- Oh, well, that's easy.

407
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:51,950
You get something
incriminating on him.

408
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,210
Call me in the office,
we'll discuss it,

409
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,750
and then I can also
keep a record,

410
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,460
you know,
for billing and so forth.

411
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,210
Yeah, well, maybe I'll just keep
a record of it, too,

412
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,000
so I can follow up
with my own bill.

413
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,630
Oh, very good.

414
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:05,220
You should be the lawyer.
Very good. Pro bono.

415
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,930
<i>Knowing that she could</i>
<i>very well</i>

416
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:08,430
<i>be kicked out of school,</i>

417
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,890
<i>Maeby went in search</i>
<i>of an overdue check</i>

418
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,310
<i>at the penthouse.</i>

419
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:14,180
<i>And as she was</i>
<i>checking out the mail...</i>

420
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:16,060
Oh, my God!

421
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,110
<i>...she ran into an ostrich</i>
<i>in heat</i>

422
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,730
<i>- that was interested</i>
- Here, that way, that way.

423
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,440
<i>in checking out the female.</i>

424
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,650
And she wouldn't even
let me get a cat.

425
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,320
<i>And after freeing the ostrich</i>

426
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,570
<i>to eventually find love</i>
<i>on the adjoining balcony,</i>

427
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:33,790
<i>she was back searching for</i>
<i>a long overdue royalty check.</i>

428
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:36,080
<i>In fact, it had arrived</i>
<i>one day earlier.</i>

429
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,750
"From Gangie for facelift"?
Mother.

430
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:42,550
<i>But she did find</i>
<i>that she was being honored</i>

431
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:44,630
<i>at an award show dedicated</i>
<i>to the achievements</i>

432
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:47,590
<i>of young people</i>
<i>in the entertainment business.</i>

433
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,510
I'm getting an Opie?

434
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,550
<i>And it did boost her esteem.</i>

435
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,970
- Hey.
<i>- The only bigger honor</i>

436
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,930
<i>would be having</i>
<i>an award like that</i>

437
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,980
<i>named after you, I guess.</i>

438
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,560
<i>Days later, however,</i>

439
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,860
<i>she was called</i>
<i>to Donny Richter's classroom.</i>

440
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,820
- Hey, you wanted to see me?
- Mm, yeah.

441
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,360
I got you tacos.

442
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,450
I hope that's okay,
because you're

443
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:09,660
going to sit here
through lunch and study.

444
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,990
No, I can't. I can't.

445
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,160
Young lady, you better
pull it together

446
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,700
or you're not going to graduate.

447
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,790
What is it going to take
to get you to focus?

448
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:18,040
Are you on drugs?

449
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,540
Because, from what I hear,

450
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,630
there might be an undercover cop
at this school.

451
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,420
<i>In fact,</i>
<i>it was an undercover cop</i>

452
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,710
<i>she was searching</i>
<i>for a way to incriminate.</i>

453
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,510
How long do you want
to stay in high school?

454
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:30,010
- You're 17.
<i>- And that's when she remembered</i>

455
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:32,550
<i>that Perfecto thought</i>
<i>she was 17, too.</i>

456
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,140
You know what?
I think I will do better

457
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,640
once I get
a little Mexican in me.

458
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,520
<i>Maeby got her cousin</i>
<i>to drive her to the Opies</i>

459
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,900
<i>so she could impress him</i>
<i>with her achievements.</i>

460
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,070
Well, I'm going to go mingle
with a bunch of 13-year-olds

461
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:50,660
who think they can still
play fifth grade.

462
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,280
- Have fun.
- I'll catch up.

463
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,530
<i>- And Maeby ran into her old</i>
- Oh, my gosh.

464
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,830
<i>- studio boss, Mort Meyers.</i>
- As I live and breathe.

465
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,120
I'm actually getting

466
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,580
the lifetime achievement Opie
tonight.

467
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,830
I'm very sorry.

468
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,210
Yeah.
- No,

469
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,670
they only give that award away

470
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:05,210
to somebody after they die or,

471
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,260
even worse,
after your career is dead.

472
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,460
Really?

473
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,970
Well, consider yourself lucky.

474
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:12,140
They told you
your career was over.

475
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,390
I didn't find out until I was
locked out of my office,

476
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:16,850
'cause, see,
I passed on "Hunger Games."

477
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:19,060
- Mm. - It wasn't the most
graceful of exits.

478
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,890
That's the way
the cookie crumbles.

479
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,400
This is for you.

480
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,520
Thanks, man.

481
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,770
<i>No, actually,</i>

482
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,190
the exit was pretty graceful.

483
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,780
I think I just remember it
that way

484
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,950
'cause it got dicey
when I was sneaking back in

485
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,910
to take a (bleep) on Sid's desk.

486
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,750
<i>But do what I do.</i>

487
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:43,250
When they kick you out
of the business, save face

488
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:45,960
by starting
your own Internet company.

489
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,880
We're having
a big announcement today.

490
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,010
You started an Internet company?

491
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,510
It's the real deal.

492
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:52,380
It's a system that automates
provisioning...

493
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,390
<i>And once again,</i>
<i>she found herself with someone</i>

494
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:56,810
<i>who had not only moved on</i>
<i>with their life,</i>

495
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:59,270
<i>but done so in ways</i>
<i>she couldn't understand.</i>

496
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,850
...overseas financial
transactions.

497
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:02,940
- It's called Schnoodle.
- Schnoodle?

498
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,110
Take a hat;
we got 18,000 of them.

499
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,730
<i>And that's when Maeby</i>
<i>ran into a friend</i>

500
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:08,230
<i>she knew from her days</i>
<i>at Imagine.</i>

501
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,320
Rebel.

502
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,820
- Hi. How are you?
- In hell.

503
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,400
Ah, I hate the Opies.

504
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,610
But whenever Bryce gets
pregnant, guess who gets a call?

505
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,740
And you're getting the lifetime
achievement award, huh?

506
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:19,120
You know, I can laugh about it,
I can laugh

507
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,910
because I'm actually
on the upswing.

508
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,580
I was just telling Mort here

509
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,710
that I've actually started
my own Internet company.

510
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,040
I was just about to tell you.

511
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,380
Well, if you need a name,

512
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,590
I'm the guy who came up
with Schnoodle.

513
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,420
- How do we know each other?
- We don't.

514
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:32,630
That's what it is.

515
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:33,840
Well, Schnoodle's dead.

516
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,930
Fakeblock is the next big thing.

517
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:36,680
It's called Fakeblock.

518
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,220
What's this? You're talking...
talking about Fakeblock?

519
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,850
Yes. Your privacy software.

520
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,890
Oh. How does your privacy
software work?

521
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,890
- Huh? It's private.
- Yes...

522
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,900
Can I talk to you
for a second, please?

523
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:48,230
- Yes. - I don't want people
to know that I'm doing this.

524
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,770
Everybody has to know
about this, okay?

525
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,230
This could be big for me.

526
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,400
I could make Fakeblock huge.

527
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:55,450
No, no, Maeby,
there is no company.

528
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:57,320
Fakeblock is just a software
that I'm developing.

529
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,620
And the whole point
is that it's private.

530
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,950
So you can't be telling people
about it.

531
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,540
No, we got to tell people
about it.

532
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,330
I just got a lifetime
achievement award.

533
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:06,880
I'm finished.

534
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,380
And also,
I think you should consider

535
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,920
calling it "The" Fakeblock.

536
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,460
It's cleaner.

537
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:13,550
- Like "The Netflick."
- It-It's just not ready.

538
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,760
Okay, there's still a bunch
of programming problems.

539
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,140
You can get it ready,
George Michael.

540
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,760
What, you think they invite
the animals

541
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,680
and ask them to wait
while they build the zoo?

542
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,850
No, that would be a bloodbath.

543
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,730
Yeah, a total (bleep) bloodbath.

544
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:26,310
We have no money
to start a business.

545
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:28,020
Don't worry,
I'll get the ball rolling

546
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,730
with some free publicity
when I accept my award.

547
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:33,110
Come on, this could be
my only chance to be a Harris.

548
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:34,740
- A Harris?
- All right, fine.

549
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,610
You can still be the boss, okay?

550
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,320
I just don't want people to know
that I'm working with my cousin.

551
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:40,200
So, you are not my cousin.

552
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,580
You are not
George Michael Bluth.

553
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,290
I'm great with that.

554
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:46,370
In fact, you know what might
really help us sell it...

555
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:49,920
Oh, heiress. You meant...
You don't pronounce the "H."

556
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,250
- And that's not what heiress
means. - I pronounce the "H."

557
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,050
No, but that's not how
the word is...

558
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:55,880
You know, we say words the way
we say them for a reason.

559
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,470
So what is this?

560
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,640
Is this another one of these
social networking things?

561
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,220
Because I am so over those.

562
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,810
I tried to deactivate
my Facebook profile.

563
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:06,810
It's easier to get out
of Scientology.

564
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:09,020
Well, this is actually
the opposite of Facebook.

565
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,810
It's the antisocial network.

566
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,730
It prevents piracy, right?

567
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:14,150
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

568
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:16,190
Rebel Alley.

569
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,860
George Mi... Harris.

570
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,990
George Maharis, huh?

571
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:23,030
<i>And that's how George Michael</i>
<i>finally got that new name.</i>

572
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,410
<i>It felt like a good fit--</i>
<i>strong, rugged...</i>

573
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,120
- Yes.
<i>- ...untainted.</i>

574
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,920
Yes, George Maharis.

575
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,130
- Perfecto.
<i>- De nada.</i>

576
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:34,050
That's my undercover
cop boyfriend.

577
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:35,510
I'm trying to get him in bed.

578
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,550
<i>And Maeby set to work</i>
<i>in trapping him</i>

579
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:40,430
<i>- into becoming a predator.</i>
- Hey. I know why you're here.

580
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,260
Promise me you won't tell anyone
at school.

581
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,310
I'm just a huge fan
of teen stars.

582
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:46,020
- Yeah. That's very convincing.
- Yeah.

583
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,060
You're a better actor
than most of the kids here.

584
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,850
- Even Zack and Cody.
- Are they here?

585
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:52,060
I thought they were filming
a movie in Maui.

586
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:54,820
Look, I may only be 17,
Perfecto,

587
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,980
but I know you're a cop.

588
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,820
Yeah, there it is,
that cop stare.

589
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:00,450
I got to tell you,
I find it very sexy.

590
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:03,950
Okay. Okay, all right.

591
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:06,620
I'm a cop.
I'm working here undercover.

592
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,500
We're hunting down an ex-CIA
operative named Esteves

593
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,790
who's gone rogue, and...

594
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:12,040
It's the kids
from "Modern Family."

595
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,670
Sorry.
He's become a drug kingpin

596
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,590
and his son goes to Newport.
There's something going down

597
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:18,300
tonight or possibly even
at Cinco and that...

598
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,090
Rico!

599
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:21,800
Wow, you are good.

600
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,430
I have to be--
young lives depend on it.

601
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,140
To be continued.

602
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,270
You better believe it.

603
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:30,940
Rico!

604
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:33,400
<i>On her way to accept</i>
<i>her award, however,</i>

605
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,230
<i>figuring she wouldn't be</i>
<i>at an event like this again,</i>

606
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:39,400
<i>she stopped for</i>
<i>some coconut shrimp.</i>

607
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,530
<i>But narrowly missed the $50,000</i>
<i>check with her name on it</i>

608
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:46,280
<i>that her mother gave</i>
<i>to her grandfather...</i>

609
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:50,500
<i>- ...who gave it to this man.</i>
- Got the check.

610
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,540
<i>- Who gave it to this man.</i>
- Oh, man.

611
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,380
- Whoa.
- Oh.

612
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,920
<i>Although, in that moment,</i>

613
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,300
<i>she did gain some respect</i>
<i>for her mother</i>

614
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,340
...a random act
of senseless nonviolence.

615
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,220
<i>And perhaps that's why</i>
<i>she chose to share</i>

616
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,010
<i>- her problems with her.</i>
- So, what are you doing here?

617
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:05,010
I'm getting a lifetime
achievement award

618
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:07,390
for my work
in the entertainment business.

619
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:08,810
I tried.

620
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:10,560
Tell your therapist I tried.

621
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,400
I'm not in therapy!

622
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,190
Then I must have done
something right.

623
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:17,440
<i>And soon, she was saying</i>
<i>farewell to Hollywood</i>

624
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,030
<i>in a way she hoped</i>
<i>they'd remember.</i>

625
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,650
Thank you, Kirk Cameron,

626
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,240
for that incredibly
Bibley introduction.

627
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,950
Okay, so tie yourself
to your chair,

628
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:29,410
because this is going to be
a rough (bleep) ride.

629
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:31,710
I'm leaving this (bleep)
dying business

630
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,580
to join the software game.

631
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,290
Double (bleep) newsflash.

632
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:38,000
I'm starting Fakeblock
with George Maharis,

633
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,630
the world's first
antisocial network.

634
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:41,670
So you know what?
You can take this Opie

635
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,930
and shove it up your (bleep),
all right?

636
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:45,890
Because I will (bleep) punt
the next god(bleep) (bleep)

637
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:48,260
who tells me I'm finished,
you (bleep) (bleep)hats.

638
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,180
So you can all
go (bleep) yourselves!

639
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,850
What? Sure.

640
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:56,480
Please welcome the talented
voices of Phineas and Ferb.

641
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,690
Go (bleep) yourself!

642
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,900
(bleep) you.

643
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:05,110
<i>And although she was pursued,</i>
<i>she was able to shake security</i>

644
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,370
<i>when a bigger problem occurred.</i>

645
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:09,580
Right this way, sir.

646
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:13,040
<i>And after the explosion,</i>
<i>Maeby saw her mother</i>

647
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,960
<i>whoring out her principles,</i>
<i>and quickly lost the respect</i>

648
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,500
<i>- she had briefly held...</i>
- I'd like that very much.

649
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,830
Sir, the press awaits.

650
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,380
<i>...and decided to call her</i>
<i>on it.</i>

651
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,090
Are you really gonna
whore yourself out like that?

652
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:24,050
- I am not a whore.
- Yeah, you're a whore.

653
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:25,800
<i>As it turns out,</i>
<i>the exchange</i> was

654
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,720
<i>witnessed by Herbert Love's</i>
<i>campaign manager,</i>

655
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,180
<i>who, in possession of</i>
<i>a third-party check</i>

656
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,270
<i>from "Gangie IV: Face Lift,"</i>

657
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:35,100
<i>was looking to trade</i>
<i>some greenbacks for a redhead.</i>

658
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,520
Ma'am, is she yours?

659
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,440
Unfortunately.

660
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,230
Herbert Love would like
to see her.

661
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,650
You can arrange that?

662
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:44,190
Obviously,
discretion is appreciated.

663
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,900
<i>And that's how Maeby</i>
<i>got both the seed money</i>

664
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:48,820
<i>- for her company...</i>
- I'm the discreetiest.

665
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,410
And just to be clear, I want
to hire her for prostitution.

666
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:52,870
Yes, no, definitely.

667
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:54,750
That was clear.
I'm gonna charge you for that.

668
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:57,000
<i>...and became</i>
<i>her mother's pimp.</i>

669
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,250
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>the plan required getting back</i>

670
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:01,800
<i>into her mother's good graces</i>
<i>to trick her</i>

671
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,010
<i>- into turning a trick.</i>
- Hi, sweetie.

672
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:06,470
Free... bie. Hi.

673
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,680
<i>But the universe seemed</i>
<i>to like the plan.</i>

674
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,050
<i>And that's how Maeby was able</i>

675
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:10,640
<i>to get her mother</i>
<i>to meet Herbert</i>

676
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,510
<i>at the club</i>
<i>that Maeby still belonged to.</i>

677
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,520
...I could never call him.

678
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,430
I could call him for you.

679
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,520
<i>Technically, she still needed</i>
<i>to talk her mother</i>

680
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,480
<i>into having sex with him.</i>

681
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,530
<i>But this was a woman who once</i>
<i>wore this to a men's prison,</i>

682
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:26,570
<i>so she felt she'd be okay.</i>

683
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:28,320
<i>- And soon, she was pimping out</i>
- Can you believe this?

684
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,530
<i>George Michael's</i>
<i>software company as well.</i>

685
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,120
Fakeblock-- it's exploding.

686
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,740
I got my P.R. company
fanning it.

687
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:36,750
I even got it to the attention
of Jim Cramer.

688
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:37,960
Jim Cramer?

689
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,830
He's a guy I've worked with,

690
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:41,630
and he even mentioned it
on "Mad Money."

691
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:43,960
This Fakeblock thing
is poised to explode!

692
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,220
I never do this, hell,
it's not even a stock yet.

693
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,050
For all I know,
it's not even real!

694
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:51,510
But I think this might be
going through the roof!

695
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:54,810
I'm calling it my first
"Hypothetical Buy."

696
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:57,640
And this weekend,
don't forget to catch me

697
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,230
on "Gangie IV."
Here's a taste.

698
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:01,060
This old lady's crazy!

699
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:04,400
I'm raising the alert level
from "Don't Leave the House"

700
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:08,240
to "Board Up Your Windows!"

701
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,240
<i>Over the following days,</i>
<i>Maeby was able</i>

702
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:13,120
<i>to discreetly bring in cash</i>
<i>from Herbert Love</i>

703
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,830
<i>for services she got her mother</i>
<i>to unknowingly render.</i>

704
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:19,540
Well, why don't you take him out
to dinner?

705
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,670
Hmm? Guys who are used
to being charged--

706
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:23,330
I mean in charge,

707
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,920
sometimes like it when the other
person takes control.

708
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,420
Hmm. Well, maybe I will.

709
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,090
How about
the Balboa Yacht Club, huh?

710
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:32,130
- Put it on the family tab.
- Of course.

711
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,350
All right, have fun.
I wish I could go out to dinner.

712
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:36,930
What am I doing?
This is disgusting.

713
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:38,640
I've got money coming in.

714
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,390
<i>All the while putting money</i>
<i>into the company...</i>

715
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,100
...ultimate privacy on the Web
until now.

716
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:45,190
If you don't believe me,
do a something search on it.

717
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:48,190
<i>...and bringing in more cash</i>
<i>as a result--</i>

718
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:51,820
<i>her self-esteem growing</i>
<i>every day.</i>

719
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,530
<i>Soon, she had enough money</i>

720
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:56,660
<i>for an apartment and to set up</i>
<i>a Fakeblock office.</i>

721
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:00,080
Right. Um, do you want
some stock options?

722
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,080
Yeah? All right, well,
split it up with everyone.

723
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,920
That's for everybody.

724
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,500
<i>She even got George Michael</i>
<i>a cool retro company car.</i>

725
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:10,090
- Hey. - Hi. You actually
rented a little office.

726
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:12,130
Yeah. I don't want you to see
it yet. Still setting it up.

727
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:15,390
With a little help from a
wealthy benefactor, Lucille 2.

728
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:17,720
- Oh, Gangie.
- No, Lucille 2.

729
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,930
Austero.

730
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:20,850
I don't know who that is.

731
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:22,690
You don't?

732
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:24,400
Never met the woman.

733
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,820
Well, she'll be the one driving
the staircar from now on.

734
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,940
- It was part of the deal.
- You gave her my car?

735
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,780
Yeah, it's technically
hers anyways,

736
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,450
- 'cause of the Bluth Company.
- Oh.

737
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:35,450
- But I did get you her
1988 yellow Cadillac. - Yeah?

738
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:37,490
She only uses it
to and from hip replacements.

739
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:42,460
I guess that's only funny
if you know who she is.

740
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,750
<i>And with the extra cash,</i>
<i>even got around to spraying</i>

741
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:47,460
<i>for pests at the model home</i>
<i>where she was squatting.</i>

742
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:51,090
...that I never got from
you for the last 40 years.

743
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:52,550
Hey, so what do I owe you?

744
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:54,340
Here you go.

745
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:57,260
That's funny, I actually used
to date a guy named Steve Holt.

746
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,050
Ha! Steve Holt!

747
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,390
Yeah, that's the guy.

748
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:02,810
Oh...

749
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:05,140
<i>Although the house wouldn't</i>
<i>remain pest-free for long.</i>

750
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,440
Heck of a birthday
this is shaping up to be.

751
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:10,860
<i>In fact,</i>
<i>it was about to get worse.</i>

752
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,190
<i>And Maeby's privacy</i>
<i>was about to get violated...</i>

753
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,820
- Why did we stop?
- We hit a bug.

754
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,740
<i>...when her uncles</i>
<i>barged in unannounced.</i>

755
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:19,530
I know, I know, I've got these
things very, you know,

756
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,490
- meticulously maintained.
- (bleep)

757
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,290
- There's...
- There are some vultures.

758
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:24,660
They might still smell Pete.

759
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:26,330
<i>And she still managed</i>
<i>to continue</i>

760
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:28,290
<i>seducing Perfecto</i>
<i>into seducing her.</i>

761
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:29,670
I'm like, this top is
completely see-through.

762
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:31,130
I'll put it on and show you.

763
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:32,880
I'm like, "Where am I
supposed to wear this?"

764
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,630
<i>This high school senior</i>
<i>was working three jobs.</i>

765
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,680
- Okay, buh-buh-buh-buh.
- We have to be discreet.

766
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,010
<i>- And she did her jobs well.</i>
- What? - We have to be discreet!

767
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:41,720
- Oh, right.
<i>- And soon, it was time</i>

768
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,520
<i>for Maebyto show</i>
<i>George Michael the office.</i>

769
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,860
Welcome!

770
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,570
I'm a softie; I hired the guy.

771
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:54,530
He's more like a mascot
than anything.

772
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:56,030
Mort, where's my coffee?

773
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:58,820
Oh, damn. Oh, stupid Mort.

774
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:00,120
I know, it's okay, just focus.

775
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,450
I'm going to take the cart

776
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:03,450
and show George Michael
his new office.

777
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:05,330
Speechless, huh?

778
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:06,870
How do I get back?!

779
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,250
Of course, when Fakeblock hits,

780
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:10,210
we're going to have to ramp up
real fast.

781
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:13,460
This hangar can hold
over 500 nerds!

782
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,800
Maeby, we can't afford this.

783
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,630
- And my software isn't even
ready. - Don't worry about that.

784
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,180
Just worry about the app
being done in time

785
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,060
for the big public unveiling
at Cinco.

786
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,350
I'll get the money.

787
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:24,680
Isn't that in, like, three days?

788
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,020
Uh, no, that's Cinco de Mayo.

789
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,850
Cinco de Quatro is in two days.

790
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:30,610
But we'll be doing it on a boat,
so I hope you don't get seasick.

791
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:32,070
You're doing the keynote.

792
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:35,610
You're responsible
for all of this.

793
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:38,820
- Come on.
- Wh... No, I...

794
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,990
I-I... I think we, uh...

795
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:42,660
All of this.

796
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,540
Oh, I think we should delay
the keynote.

797
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,960
You know, I'd say yes,
but I don't think we can

798
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,370
just because of the sheer amount
of money

799
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:49,790
that you have on the hook
for it.

800
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:52,380
Maeby, you're fired!

801
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:56,210
I got her coffee.

802
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,050
<i>Maeby had just lost</i>
<i>a big career option</i>

803
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:03,350
<i>when she ran into the current</i>
<i>squatter of the penthouse.</i>

804
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:04,970
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey. Maeby.

805
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:06,680
Wow. What are you doing here?

806
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,730
I'm just here to see Lucille 2,
actually.

807
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:11,520
<i>In fact, she was there</i>
<i>to see Lucille 2's</i>

808
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,860
<i>so-called foster child,</i>
<i>Perfecto.</i>

809
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,780
...talk to you about something
very important.

810
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:18,030
Yeah, um, Uncle Michael,

811
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,650
I-I'm really sorry about
that whole

812
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,410
"voting you out of the dorm"
thing.

813
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:23,780
- You know... - You know,
we never really meant it to...

814
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,200
Ah, I knew it.

815
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,740
I knew you didn't understand it.

816
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:28,370
I knew you guys were all...

817
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:30,830
'Cause I didn't...
I don't think I explained it

818
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:32,250
very well,
and it was very, very simple.

819
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:33,670
I made it complicated.

820
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:35,340
It was a four-person vote.

821
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:38,090
You see, I voted against myself,
so that P-Hound...

822
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:40,090
And that's a way that-that
scenario would've worked out.

823
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:42,010
What I later realized is that
there was another scenario--

824
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:43,260
Maeby. That there was
another scenario,

825
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,850
- Yeah.
- a C scenario, scenario C,

826
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:46,430
- where you... Okay.
- I really got to get going.

827
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:47,970
- All right, but before
you do, - I got to... Yeah.

828
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,810
I just need your signature here
at the bottom.

829
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:51,270
Doing a movie about

830
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:53,230
- the family.
- Yeah. Is that still happening?

831
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:54,900
- What do you mean?
- I got to tell you,

832
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,070
I think movies are dead.

833
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:58,480
Maybe it's a TV show.

834
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:01,030
- Thank you. I owe you one.
- Yeah. No, you don't.

835
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,530
<i>And now a half hour late,</i>

836
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:04,620
<i>Maeby went back to her plan</i>

837
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,910
<i>of seducing an undercover cop.</i>

838
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:08,830
<i>And that's when Lucille 2</i>

839
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:12,410
<i>saw a very real girl</i>
<i>in her imaginary boy's room.</i>

840
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:15,380
<i>And after,</i>
<i>secure that she had something</i>

841
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:18,460
<i>with which</i>
<i>to blackmail Perfecto,</i>

842
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,010
<i>she sought out a late payment</i>
<i>from the Love campaign</i>

843
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:22,760
<i>at Cinco.</i>
<i>As it turns out,</i>

844
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,430
<i>the Love campaign</i>
<i>had just taken care</i>

845
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:26,890
<i>of a threat of their own.</i>

846
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:28,720
- Why can't I do this?
<i>- And that's when</i>

847
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,220
<i>Maeby ran into her mother.</i>

848
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,640
Oh, Maeby.

849
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,770
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

850
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:34,230
I need to apologize to you.

851
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:36,520
That check
you've been looking for,

852
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,150
I had it.

853
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:39,360
"Had"?

854
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,570
It's not everything,

855
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:42,320
but here's some money.

856
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,780
Mom, let go.

857
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,120
It's dirty money anyway.

858
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,160
Love gave it to me.

859
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,990
<i>Maeby felt bad.</i>

860
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,910
He gave you money directly?

861
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,250
If you can believe that.

862
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:55,000
Anyway, this is your money now,

863
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:58,790
and if you choose
to do facial reconstruction...

864
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,170
I mean, the nose, right?

865
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:05,010
<i>But Maeby was more concerned</i>

866
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:07,640
<i>about losing</i>
<i>yet another income stream.</i>

867
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,430
So he's trying to snake
the bottom bitch from my stable?

868
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:13,100
<i>And more importantly,</i>
<i>her rep on the street.</i>

869
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,310
<i>And she knew</i>
<i>just who to go to about it.</i>

870
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:16,980
He stole money from me.

871
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,150
He's a bully, so I want you

872
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:21,360
to "bad cop" him
for me a little, okay?

873
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,650
So where is this bully?

874
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:25,030
He's right there.

875
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,360
The little guy
with the cigarette?

876
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:27,910
No, the ripped black guy
behind him.

877
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,780
- Oh, right.
<i>- Perfecto was nervous...</i>

878
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,950
I just... I just didn't look
up high enough.

879
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:34,000
<i>...but headed off</i>
<i>to do as told.</i>

880
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,620
- Herbert Love, Herbert Love...
<i>- And later,</i>

881
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,250
<i>after Herbert Love</i>
<i>didn't return,</i>

882
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:39,380
<i>- Perfecto did.</i>
- Hey, did you do it?

883
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,630
It's taken care of.

884
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:42,630
Oh.

885
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:44,420
<i>But that's when</i>
<i>the party got out of control.</i>

886
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,090
What's going on?

887
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:47,340
Guess the blowback has started.

888
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,640
Thank God I'm with
an undercover cop.

889
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,640
Pull out your gun.

890
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,930
I don't have a gun.

891
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:52,140
What kind of cop
doesn't have a gun?

892
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:54,020
Okay, I'm not a cop.

893
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:56,020
But I saw your badge at the bar.

894
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:59,310
<i>In fact,</i>
<i>it was an anti-bullying badge.</i>

895
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:01,230
<i>He'd received it</i>
<i>from a police-run</i>

896
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:03,480
<i>anti-bullying program</i>
<i>at school.</i>

897
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:04,900
You're never too old
to stand up to a bully.

898
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,900
<i>I made up all that stuff</i>

899
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:09,070
to impress you;
I'm just a senior.

900
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,780
A señor?

901
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:12,200
I'm 17.

902
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,870
Ha!

903
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:15,750
You're 17?

904
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:16,870
Yeah.

905
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:18,710
I'm 23.

906
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,250
Oh, that's a relief.

907
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:22,090
I wasn't supposed
to be driving with you.

908
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:23,550
But we messed around.

909
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:26,170
<i>Oh, they did more than that.</i>

910
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,220
Don't worry; nobody saw.

911
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:31,470
<i>Except Lucille 2.</i>

912
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:33,680
<i>And that's when Maeby,</i>
<i>who had spent so long</i>

913
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:37,230
<i>lying to others</i>
<i>and even herself,</i>

914
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:40,060
<i>finally had to admit</i>
<i>she had made a huge mis...</i>

915
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,230
Oh, no, I'm fine.

916
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,360
<i>...Lucille 2 becomes</i>
<i>less of a threat to Maeby.</i>

917
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,660
...is an ongoing investigation,
we are pretty certain

918
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:55,330
that this is where
Lucille Austero landed.

919
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:57,660
It is the way she usually falls.

920
00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:59,120
Are you gonna run in her place?

921
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:01,710
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
let's not bury her yet.

922
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,750
We are all
still holding out hope

923
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:05,880
that she is, indeed, found.

924
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,130
<i>But a new threat</i>
<i>to Maeby emerges.</i>

925
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,390
Shh. Stop it. What?

926
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:12,890
Can we at least have
breakup sex?

927
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:14,510
No, you're 17.

928
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,020
I'm 23-year-old woman.

929
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,730
If anyone found out
that we already had sex,

930
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:19,730
it would be a major felony.

931
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:22,690
Congratulations.
You got your first A.

932
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:25,770
Oh, thank God. This A is finally
gonna get me out of high school.

933
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:28,490
No, sex offender,
your A is going to jail.

934
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:30,820
You can't arrest me;
you're an algebra teacher.

935
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:33,200
Donny Richter is
an algebra teacher.

936
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,910
I'm Rocky Richter.

937
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:37,700
I told you there was an
undercover cop in this school.

938
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:40,410
Oh, God.

939
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,360
I'm gonna have to live
in Sudden Valley.
