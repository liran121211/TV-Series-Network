1
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:14,050
<i>Gob Bluth had just</i>
<i>been told by his father</i>

2
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,470
<i>to go to work</i>
<i>for his younger brother.</i>

3
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:18,260
And then thanks
for the birthday card

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,390
that I never got from you
for the last 40 years.

5
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:23,220
<i>In fact,</i>

6
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:25,270
<i>- it was a brother with whom</i>
<i>Gob...</i>-What the hell?

7
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:26,480
<i>...was secretly competitive.</i>

8
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,770
I got the right of way.

9
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,190
- N-No.
- Okay.

10
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,820
<i>And perhaps it was</i>
<i>that sense of competition...</i>

11
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:38,570
<i>...that led</i>
<i>to this tinkling match.</i>

12
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,410
<i>I've met someone.</i>

13
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:43,120
Can't really give you any
information-- kind of famousy.

14
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,790
- I also met someone.
- Have you?

15
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:47,000
Also famousy.
Can't give<i>you</i>any information.

16
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,500
- Is it Julie Bowen?
- No, it's not.

17
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,170
- Is yours Julie Bowen?
- Is yours Julie...?

18
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,920
Oh, my God, Michael,
you're seeing Julie Bowen?

19
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,170
I am not seeing Julie Bowen,

20
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:57,380
but if you are,
you tell me right now.

21
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,140
I want to hear you say the words
"I'm not seeing Julie Bowen."

22
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,300
I have not seen Julie Bowen.

23
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:03,760
Well, that's a funny way
to phrase it.

24
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:05,600
<i>This went on for some time,</i>

25
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,310
<i>but eventually</i>
<i>they started talking business.</i>

26
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:10,350
If it wasn't for the movie
thing, I would do it myself.

27
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,560
They practically sell
themselves; you just got

28
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,230
to bring the people in.

29
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,610
- Lindsay.<i>-But soon the hard</i>
<i>lemonade softened</i>

30
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,360
<i>- their competitive edge.</i>
- No, no, this-- maybe Tobias.

31
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,900
<i>And Michael confessed</i>

32
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:22,950
<i>that he had grown estranged</i>
<i>from his son.</i>

33
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:24,280
I'll call him for you.

34
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,370
You've given me
a new sense of purpose.

35
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:28,210
I don't want you
to get your hopes up.

36
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,830
You know, when I said that, that
these places sell themselves,

37
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:34,670
I should have gone on to say,
you know, that, that, uh...

38
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,250
No, they don't.

39
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,590
No, I'm not talking
about selling these mausoleums.

40
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:40,840
I mean destroying Tony Wonder.

41
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,220
I'm gonna destroy his career the
same way that he destroyed mine.

42
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,680
<i>Gob was referring</i>
<i>to an escape act</i>

43
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,560
<i>he'd performed that had failed</i>

44
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,310
<i>when the hidden compartment</i>
<i>that held</i>

45
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,810
<i>the keys to his escape</i>
<i>hadn't opened...</i>

46
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:52,980
- It's not going to work.
<i>- ...humiliating him</i>

47
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,400
<i>in front of his bride...</i>

48
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,730
<i>- uh, her...</i>
- He's not coming back.

49
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,820
<i>...and all of Christendom.</i>

50
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,320
Destroying Tony Wonder is
your sense of purpose?

51
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,860
I thought you said,
thanks to me...

52
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,160
Because he's performing
at a gay club tonight,

53
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,580
and I need you to act as
my boyfriend

54
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,620
to help me get in.

55
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,450
I'm gonna say no, thank you.

56
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,120
And don't you think
it's a little inappropriate?

57
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,580
I am your brother.

58
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,380
You sound like my son.

59
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,460
<i>Whom Gob had spoken to</i>
<i>earlier that day.</i>

60
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,840
<i>- And in a van, by the way.</i>
- Hey, you remembered.

61
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,180
How about you and I
go to a magic show together?

62
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,430
I love magic, of course.

63
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,430
I mean, my dad's a magician.

64
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:30,180
- Well, you're my dad, I mean,
so, so you should know. -Right.

65
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:33,940
Well, it'd be sort of a, a
father-son thing at a gay club.

66
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,770
Well, technically gay night
at a magic club.

67
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,320
Hey, you know what'd be funny?

68
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,070
If you pretended
to be my boyfriend

69
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,240
so I could lock
this guy Tony Wonder...

70
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,070
You know, I-I don't know,

71
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:44,700
I-I don't think this whole thing
is sounding like a good idea.

72
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,030
Besides, last time we tried
to do something together,

73
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,620
- you didn't even show up.
- You know what?

74
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,950
You're mad at me--
I get it, I totally get it,

75
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,790
- and guess what--
I'm mad at you. -You know, Dad,

76
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:56,290
that attitude might be
why you're alone all the time.

77
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:58,380
- The way you treat people...
- What about you?

78
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:01,010
I didn't hear from you
for your entire childhood,

79
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,760
and then thanks
for the birthday card

80
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,100
that I never got from you
for the last 40 years.

81
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,680
<i>This was extra hard for Steve</i>

82
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,850
<i>to hear on his actual birthday.</i>

83
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,180
And didn't you already try
locking Tony Wonder in

84
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,980
- his trick?
- Oh, yeah, but that

85
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,900
wasn't for revenge,
that was just on spec.

86
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,860
- Just like Tony Wonder.
<i>- And it didn't work.Besides,</i>

87
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,940
that's before I knew that
he had locked me in my trick.

88
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,240
You still don't know that he
tried to lock you in your trick.

89
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,160
Hey, I do know, I have proof.

90
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,870
I went in that cave
and I found this.

91
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,450
We both know
what that stands for.

92
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,500
Jesus.

93
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,620
No, that would be a "J."

94
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,040
This is a "T."

95
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,130
Tony Wonder was there
in the cave the night

96
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,380
that I did my big illusion,
so when I went yesterday

97
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,380
to the cave and I saw
that this had wedged

98
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:44,300
my compartment door shut,
I knew that I'd been wronged.

99
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,590
Okay, the only thing
that we know

100
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:48,220
is that you tried to
lock Tony Wonder

101
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,180
in his trick first.

102
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,470
- Right?
- No,

103
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:51,760
- no.
- So you're even.

104
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,390
Because mine didn't work.

105
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,350
He got the last laugh,
which, in this case, happened

106
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,810
to be the first laugh.
I don't understand

107
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,190
why you can't seem to follow me

108
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,980
- on any of this.
- Gob, you've got a chance

109
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,480
to build a brand-new life.
Don't run away from it again.

110
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,530
- Don't try to escape it.
- I don't do that, Michael.

111
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,360
Listen, if you insist
on speaking to me like you're

112
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,700
my wife, then don't be surprised
to find my in you

113
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,740
and then you never hear
from me again.

114
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,990
I'm offering you a good job

115
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,210
selling good homes,
making real good money,

116
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:20,840
and I'm not asking
for anything in return.

117
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,710
What is this?

118
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,010
I'm asking for a little
something in return.

119
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,380
These-- this is for the movie.

120
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,130
This is for your life rights
in perpetuity,

121
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,140
in the known universe
and beyond.

122
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,930
Blah, blah, blah, look at this.

123
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,810
What's that mean--
you're not gonna sign it?

124
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,350
No, I was just thinking

125
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,890
that I should have my attorney
Bob Loblaw look at this.

126
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:38,900
Oh, he doesn't need to-- it's
all pretty boilerplate stuff.

127
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:39,980
Yeah, no, I'm fine with it.

128
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,770
I'm gonna be in a movie.

129
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:42,940
No, you're not.

130
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,360
I'm gonna be in a movie. Okay.

131
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,070
<i>Now the story of a family</i>

132
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:50,740
<i>whose future</i>
<i>was abruptly canceled,</i>

133
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,410
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice</i>

134
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,290
<i>but to keep himself together.</i>

135
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,330
<i>It's Gob's</i>
Arrested Development.

136
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,090
<i>Gob was making good</i>
<i>on a promise</i>

137
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,920
<i>- he had made to Michael...</i>
- Hi, Uncle Gob.

138
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,880
I need to see you tonight.

139
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:11,760
<i>- ...to talk to his son.</i>
- It's about your father and you.

140
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,100
Really, is... is he upset?

141
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,180
Do I seem like a clown to you?

142
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,560
I got it.

143
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,270
Do I seem like some kind
of a clown to you?

144
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,270
Look, I got it, I got it,
Uncle Gob, just tell me where.

145
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,110
Meet me tonight
at the Gothic Castle.

146
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,530
I will-- the Gothic Castle?

147
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,110
No, the Gothicassle.
Yes, the Gothic Castle.

148
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:28,780
No, I didn't say
the Gothicassle.

149
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,660
What, what do you think,
they call it the Gothicassle?

150
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,990
No, I said the Gothic Castle.

151
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,620
- It's the Gothic Castle.
- Gothic Castle.

152
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,830
Okay.

153
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,450
I think you look amazing.

154
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,000
I'll take it.

155
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,330
- Great.
- No, no.

156
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:43,290
The compliment, not the shirt.

157
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,590
<i>And so it was</i>
<i>a very worried George Michael</i>

158
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:49,050
<i>that arrived to speak to</i>
<i>his uncle at the Gothic Castle,</i>

159
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:51,010
<i>which, that night,</i>
<i>did actually kind of resemble</i>

160
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,300
<i>the Gothicassle.</i>

161
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,510
- Uncle Gob.
- Don't call me Unc...

162
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,010
Actually, no, that's good,
that works here.

163
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,720
Is my dad upset?
What's going on?

164
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,520
- No, he's fine. -But you told me
he was really upset

165
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,350
- about something.
- I don't know.

166
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,730
I do know that your daddy
wants you to get

167
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,110
your hot, little, tight,
little, hot ass

168
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,940
right up there right away
to see him.

169
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,820
You're good. -You,
you had me come all the way here

170
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,490
just to tell me
my dad wants me to meet him?

171
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,320
No, no, those two things
are unrelated.

172
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,410
No, I'm, I'm here 'cause
I'm trying to lock this guy Tony

173
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:15,910
into this gay magic trick,

174
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:18,330
and I just needed
a believable arm candy bean.

175
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:20,370
And don't make that face;
you look homophobic.

176
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,170
- No, I'm not being homophobic.
- Why are you doing this?

177
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:23,920
- I'm, I'm uncomfortable.
- This is very important for me.

178
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,790
Don't worry, you're blending in
here perfectly.

179
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,750
A newbie.

180
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,800
Except,

181
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,260
even if he does post that
somewhere,

182
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,590
the Fakeblock thing
will scrub it away.

183
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,380
You know about Fakeblock?

184
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,350
You know, that's my software.

185
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,430
I wonder if my dad thinks
I'm blowing him off

186
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,470
because that's starting
to take off now.

187
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,640
Well, you should go find out
'cause I do know that your dad

188
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,690
is really, really,
really upset with you.

189
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,520
He is upset?
I asked you that.

190
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,820
That was literally
the first thing I asked you.

191
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,690
You're giving me these craz...

192
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:51,240
- Mad?
- N...

193
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,110
- God, what is that inky taste?
- It's my stamp.

194
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,740
- Oh, I'm so sorry about that.
- No, that-that's okay.

195
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,990
I probably won't come back in.

196
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,990
I-I'm gonna go see my dad.

197
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,750
Yeah, you are
'cause you're a good son.

198
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,370
Ow!

199
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:05,330
- Bit my tongue, that little
bitch.<i>-Oh, no, he didn't.</i>

200
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,670
- They're always doing that.
<i>- I mean, oh, no, he didn't.</i>

201
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,960
Thank you, George Michael;
honestly I owe you big-time.

202
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,090
Not a lot of nephews
would do this for their uncles.

203
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:13,340
Now get out of here.

204
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,550
I never want to sleep
with you again.

205
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,220
I mean, I probably will.
: I don't.

206
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,680
But are we good?

207
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,350
- We're good.
<i>- After successfully looking</i>

208
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,560
<i>like he'd had a fight</i>
<i>with his boyfriend,</i>

209
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,440
<i>Gob put his plan into action.</i>

210
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,190
Knowing that Tony would go
into the closet

211
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,150
and pop out of somewhere else,

212
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:33,070
Gob proceeded to lock
everything he could find.

213
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,030
Who's the dumbwaiter now?

214
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,990
<i>And that's when he saw</i>
<i>something that took him</i>

215
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:43,950
<i>back to a moment when his life</i>
<i>had reached its nadir.</i>

216
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:48,000
<i>You know,</i>
<i>if tomorrow you won't open up</i>

217
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,670
<i>and let someone else in, then</i>
<i>the treasures you have inside</i>

218
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:54,170
<i>may never come out.</i>

219
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,890
A magician has many secrets...

220
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:03,600
...but there was one I was
forced to keep...

221
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,810
by society.

222
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:10,770
<i>And Gob settled in</i>
<i>to watch his revenge play out.</i>

223
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:14,320
"Don't talk to us," they said.

224
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,820
"Keep your hands to yourself,"
they also said.

225
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:22,240
Magic is only for straight men.

226
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,750
I don't want
to look at you, son.

227
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,960
Just go to work.

228
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,800
Why can't you be
like your brother?

229
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,430
There! Stay in there!

230
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:45,100
We don't want you out here!

231
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:49,850
Well, I'm here,
I'm queer, and now...

232
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,110
I'm in a chair!

233
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,530
Did somebody say Wonder?

234
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,150
<i>Nobody actually did that time,</i>

235
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,990
<i>but I think</i>
<i>he got away with it.</i>

236
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:00,570
Didn't expect to see you here.
Want to get a drink later?

237
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,990
<i>And believe it or not,</i>
<i>it was this trick...</i>

238
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,660
Now everybody's gay!

239
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,080
<i>...that really brought</i>
<i>the crowd to their feet.</i>

240
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,540
<i>Although it was pretty easy</i>
<i>to figure out how he did it.</i>

241
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,000
<i>They started out gay.</i>

242
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,920
You missed your cue!

243
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,090
<i>Gob was having a drink</i>
<i>with a man</i>

244
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:17,880
<i>he'd twice tried to sabotage.</i>

245
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,340
Beanbag chair-- I was wondering
what you were gonna pop out of.

246
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,850
Did somebody say Wonder...

247
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,510
...ing?

248
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,810
I always try to stay one step
ahead of the audience.

249
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:27,850
<i>Vamanos!</i>

250
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,650
Oh, hey, come on, man.

251
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:33,980
Timing, right?

252
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,110
Hey, leave the mask.

253
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,360
Yeah, of course-- mask.

254
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,690
Yeah, that makes sense.

255
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,360
I use a mask myself, in my act.

256
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,030
But you have to tell me how
you do that bean bag trick.

257
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:44,070
Well, I guess,
since you're a magician, too.

258
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,200
But not a word of this.

259
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,410
I did use a mask.

260
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:48,620
I put it on another guy,

261
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,040
and then I was
in the bean bag chair

262
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,120
the whole time.

263
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:52,710
Oh, well, that's... that's...

264
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,420
: ...that's why
they put that sign

265
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,460
on the bean bag chair that says,
"Do not steal this..."

266
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,340
<i>And the magicians</i>
<i>shared the secrets</i>

267
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,170
<i>of their ancient</i>
<i>and mystical craft.</i>

268
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,130
And also
it's very hard to get out of

269
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,010
at the end, when I appear.

270
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,470
So how have you been?

271
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:08,220
I haven't seen you
since your "wedding,"

272
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,730
when you did the Jesus gag.

273
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:11,690
See, it's like a quotation mark,
but with a "W."

274
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:13,190
Oh, yeah, right, I got ya.

275
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,900
That's... I should do that.

276
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,020
Hey, don't. Okay?

277
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:18,360
I-I... I won't.

278
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,820
Yeah, uh, no, the marriage
was unsuccessful.

279
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,870
I guess you could say
I was a runaway groom.

280
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,700
Well, makes sense now,
doesn't it?

281
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,910
What do you mean?

282
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:27,990
Well, I mean,
you are gay, right?

283
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,870
Oh, yes, right, yeah.

284
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:32,290
Very... because of
what I'm... dressed...

285
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:33,750
And my boyfriend
was here earlier.

286
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,210
And-and he bit my tongue.

287
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,000
<i>And that's when Gob did</i>

288
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,340
<i>a magic trick of his own.</i>

289
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,090
- Want to see?
- No, I believe you.

290
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:41,380
I'm just surprised, though,

291
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,430
because you are
the Christian magician.

292
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,800
Although you did look awfully
shredded on that cross.

293
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,220
You should have seen me

294
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,770
when they took me
out of the storage locker.

295
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:51,680
- Hmm. -But how'd I get in
the storage locker?

296
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:53,100
That's okay;
I know it didn't work.

297
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,730
Made the "Woops" column
in<i>Poof.</i>

298
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:56,900
<i>It's cool, though, man;</i>
<i>I've been there.</i>

299
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,070
<i>Your assistant probably</i>
<i>sabotaged you.</i>

300
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,610
I don't even use one anymore.

301
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:00,780
I resorted to using my own legs

302
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,490
in the
"Saw the Lady in Half" gag.

303
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:03,780
I even shaved them.

304
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,030
Want to feel?

305
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,280
Wow, they are smooth.

306
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,120
Like a lady's.

307
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,790
I think.

308
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,120
You're funny.

309
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,960
- Too bad we can't do this more.
- Why?

310
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,170
I don't know if it'd be

311
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,590
great for my reputation
to be seen

312
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,710
with the fundamentalist
Christian magician.

313
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,300
<i>And he was suspicious that Gob</i>
<i>might not actually be gay.</i>

314
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,720
Valet is closing.
The Cabriolet--

315
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,390
- "ANUS TART."
- That's me.

316
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:31,270
Aw, what the hell,
let's do it.

317
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:34,310
<i>And that's when Gob came up</i>
<i>with a new revenge plan.</i>

318
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,730
Yeah, let's risk it.

319
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:36,900
Right? Let's risk it!

320
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,400
Come on.

321
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:44,700
<i>The next day, Gob shared</i>
<i>his new plan with Tobias.</i>

322
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,070
Good. Seems like
you're done talking.

323
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:47,740
I, too, am in a relationship,

324
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:50,410
but mine is purely
a revenge-based deal.

325
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:52,790
Plan on making this person
fall in love with me

326
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:55,410
and then destroying them
by breaking their heart.

327
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,170
How do you make someone
fall in love with you?

328
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,210
- Can you pass the mustard,
please? -Yeah.

329
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,840
Oh, it's easy when
you've got so much in common.

330
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,340
Last night, for instance,

331
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,840
we both got a case
of the munchies,

332
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,800
and then we went out
and we stole these pies...

333
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,850
<i>As it turns out, they did</i>
<i>a lot more than steal pies.</i>

334
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:13,680
<i>They had a raucous good time.</i>

335
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,140
And then the candy
bean dish right here,

336
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,520
we made those
at "Color Me Mine,"

337
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,020
and I know they're
kind of cockeyed,

338
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,980
but they remind us both
of my crooked smile.

339
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,110
Sounds like you're really
into this girl.

340
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,860
Don't call me girl, friend.

341
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,740
No, this is purely
an act of revenge,

342
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:28,030
filled with white-hot hate.

343
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:30,870
I'd tell you on who, but this
person is sort of a celebrity.

344
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:31,950
Oh!

345
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:34,120
Well, turns out my femme fatale

346
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,540
is a bit of a celebrity herself.

347
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,370
<i>And that's when</i>
<i>Gob found a solution</i>

348
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:39,250
<i>to filling one of the houses.</i>

349
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:40,840
...I've been looking
for a place to live.

350
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,380
That's great.
When can you move in?

351
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,090
Uh, duh! Now!

352
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,760
Oh, the other sex offenders
are going to be so jealous.

353
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,590
Wait a minute...

354
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,680
you know of other people
with similar needs?

355
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,520
<i>And that's when</i>
<i>he filled the rest.</i>

356
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,270
Oh, I have a list of men

357
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,850
that could fill
every opening you have.

358
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,650
Let me get a shot of mustard.

359
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:07,700
That was all cheese,
but no mustard.

360
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,450
<i>Not wanting</i>
<i>to appear desperate,</i>

361
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:13,160
<i>Gob waited till late afternoon</i>
<i>to continue his plan</i>

362
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,870
<i>to make Tony</i>
<i>fall in love with him.</i>

363
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,620
It's Tony.

364
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:20,210
I'm not here right now,
because I'm right behind you.

365
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,960
Made you look.

366
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,500
But how did I know you looked?

367
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,130
Because I'm right behind you!

368
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,010
Made you look again.

369
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:30,300
Tony, it's Gob.

370
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,680
Man, does anybody
ever fall for that?

371
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,850
Listen, uh, I was just,
I was thinking about you--

372
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,890
what a fun night
we had the other night.

373
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:39,980
So just call me
when you get a chance.

374
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,940
Okay? All right.

375
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,020
Wow, that was fast,
you hot little...

376
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:46,730
- It's your mother.
- Hi.

377
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,570
Sorry, I thought you were
somebody else.

378
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:50,910
I can't tell you who, 'cause I'm
dating someone famous.

379
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:53,490
<i>And that's when Gob</i>
<i>was given a new job.</i>

380
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:55,490
You better start
to build this wall, pronto.

381
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:58,120
I tried with your father,
but he can't do it.

382
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,120
<i>And that's when Gob</i>
<i>was told to make it</i>

383
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,960
<i>...look like major construction</i>

384
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,250
<i>had begun on the wall.</i>

385
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:06,460
<i>So Gob set out to find a crew.</i>

386
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:11,220
Who wants to...

387
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,510
Hurt my ears.

388
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:15,140
Who wants
to help me build a wall...

389
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,560
to keep Mexicans out of America?

390
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,350
All right, all right!

391
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,890
Who wants to help me

392
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,270
build a wall for no reason?

393
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,230
It's a different wall.

394
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:33,320
Aah! This thing is loud!

395
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,950
<i>And so he decided to head</i>
<i>to the border ribbon</i>

396
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,790
<i>to put in some</i>
<i>manual labor himself.</i>

397
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,240
...show everyone
that I'm not afraid of

398
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:42,370
the sweet sting of sweat
in my eyes.

399
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:45,920
<i>...when he came across</i>
<i>a local maca picker.</i>

400
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,920
You need help to make
your sign stand up?

401
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,550
Yes. No!

402
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:52,090
I need to find some Mexicans
to help build this wall.

403
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,550
Hey, you know what?

404
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:54,760
You should get the Chinese
to build your wall.

405
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,760
We make great walls.

406
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,760
That would be great.

407
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,100
How can we make that happen?

408
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,220
I'm Chinese; I know all Chinese.

409
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,600
I hook you up.

410
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,980
Well, that's, uh...

411
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,690
That'd be... great.

412
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,270
Would you get off
my , Mother!

413
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:07,610
Well, if I wasn't sure
you were gay, I am now.

414
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:09,900
It's Tony. Hey, Tony.

415
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,490
Sorry I couldn't
talk last night,

416
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:14,030
but, uh, I'd really love
to get together later.

417
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:16,410
This week,
or maybe Saturday, say, 5:00?

418
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,080
- Great.
- I'm thinking Little Ballroom.

419
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,370
Little Ballroom good?
Or you sick of Little Ballroom?

420
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:23,040
- I'll see you there.
- Bye.

421
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,620
That was Tony.
My friend Tony.

422
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,830
Oh, she sounds wonderful.

423
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,420
No... no...
I'm gonna get revenge on him

424
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,170
and destroy his life.

425
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:32,590
Her life.

426
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,930
Our... life.

427
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:37,050
Destroy our life.

428
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,430
Destroy our life.

429
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,890
That doesn't matter.
Who cares?

430
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:43,230
<i>But Tony Wonder</i>
<i>had a secret, too.</i>

431
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,730
We're on.

432
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:46,650
And he definitely thinks
you're gay, right?

433
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,310
Don't worry, the only thing I'm
better at than -ing women

434
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,230
is pretending I'm gay.

435
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:52,070
Trust me, I am all man.

436
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:54,070
Give me a little leg shave?

437
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:55,650
All right, well,
you have to be careful.

438
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,700
If Gob finds out
you're straight,

439
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,490
he'll use it to ruin you,

440
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:01,660
and I'll lose the hundred grand
I stole from Lucille Austero

441
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,450
to re-brand you
as the gay magician.

442
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,830
<i>It seemed Sally Sitwell</i>
<i>had a secret also.</i>

443
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:07,500
I know that.

444
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,920
Why are you telling me all this?

445
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,210
'Cause if she finds out,
we both go down.

446
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,960
And I don't want
to have to sell that closet

447
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:14,760
as a sweat sauna on Craigslist.

448
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,550
- Ow!
- Ooh. Sorry.

449
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,130
It's fine.

450
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,180
And as long as we're recapping

451
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,010
things that we already know,

452
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,390
an inside source tells me

453
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:24,230
he's my ticket
to Internet billions.

454
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:25,520
Inside source?

455
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,440
Oh, I didn't tell you that?

456
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,600
- No.
- That's new?

457
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,520
It's "in the bag."

458
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,980
<i>Tony made that sound</i>
<i>a lot cooler than it was.</i>

459
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,070
That Fakeblock thing will
scrub it away.

460
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,150
You know about Fakeblock?

461
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:36,990
You know, that's my software.

462
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,660
I wonder if my dad thinks...

463
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,200
<i>It took a lot of restraint</i>
<i>for Tony to not pop out</i>

464
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,910
<i>when he heard</i>
<i>the word "wonder,"</i>

465
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:45,450
<i>but he was carried</i>
<i>into the audience</i>

466
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,750
<i>before he could hear that Gob</i>
<i>wasn't actually gay.</i>

467
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:50,000
I don't want some Spanish
guy sitting on me.

468
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,840
<i>Once I get him alone,</i>
<i>I get into his phone,</i>

469
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,420
get his boyfriend's information,

470
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:56,170
hack into his software
and make a fortune.

471
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,420
Ow!

472
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:59,430
How do you not know how
to shave a leg?

473
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,180
I've never done it before.

474
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:09,060
Anyway, he's halfway to falling
in love with me already.

475
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,690
I mean, he actually sounded
excited about seeing me tonight.

476
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:15,610
Poor guy doesn't realize
I'm about to destroy our life.

477
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:18,030
Our life?

478
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:20,910
I mean,
destroy our life with Gob.

479
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:26,080
Dest... I'm going to destroy
our life-- my life-- with Gob.

480
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,170
Destroy my life with Gob.

481
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:34,130
♪ Hello darkness,
my old friend... ♪

482
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:37,260
Destroy my life with Gob.

483
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,300
Just be careful.

484
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,510
Could be a house of cards.

485
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:44,390
Aah! Ooh!

486
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:46,930
- Caterpillar!
- Yep! There it went.

487
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:49,060
That's exactly what that was.

488
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,390
- Ow!
- Weird.

489
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,480
Very weird.

490
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,480
Caterpillar...

491
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,900
and that weird fuzzy moth
in the drain...

492
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:00,200
<i>It seemed Sally</i>
<i>had two secrets.</i>

493
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,240
<i>And days later,</i>
<i>Gob was feeling pretty good.</i>

494
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:09,790
<i>China Garden had come through</i>
<i>with a crew to build the wall,</i>

<i>and with the help of</i>
<i>a well-placed ad,</i>

496
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:16,500
<i>he'd successfully filled all</i>
<i>the homes in Sudden Valley.</i>

497
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:19,510
<i>And he was on his way to</i>
<i>a hot date with Tony Wonder.</i>

498
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:22,300
Siri, where is
the Little Ballroom?

499
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,010
I have three matches.

500
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:27,180
I'm going to need the gayest.

501
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,810
Did you say the "grayest"?

502
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,310
I need the, uh, gayest one.

503
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,980
Did you say the "grayest"?

504
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,310
I need the gayest
Little Ballroom!

505
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,980
Okay, Gob, try this one.

506
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,780
I've got to tell Michael
that I saw another map car.

507
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,490
He's gonna be blown away.

508
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:46,330
<i>You don't see them a lot.</i>

509
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:47,990
<i>- Well...</i>
<i>- I'm fine.</i>

510
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,910
...looks like he's turning
into a parking lot.

511
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:52,540
My Little Ballroom.
Of course, yeah.

512
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,170
<i>She's got a kid,</i>
<i>he's acting like</i>

513
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,960
<i>he's Father of the Year</i>
<i>or something.</i>

514
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,500
<i>I bet he's pretending</i>
<i>Steve Holt is, like, nine.</i>

515
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,130
<i>I just saw him,</i>
<i>he looks 50.</i>

516
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:00,760
<i>But of course Gob was</i>

517
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,840
<i>at the wrong Little Ballroom.</i>

518
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,220
I do not get this lifestyle.

519
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,140
- Gob?
- You're mistaken.

520
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,260
Hi, there.

521
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:10,270
- Michael.
- Yeah.

522
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:12,020
Well, look who's here: you.

523
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,480
Where is she?

524
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,980
First of all, that's very dated
of you, Michael.

525
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,980
"He's" don't like
to be called "she's"

526
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,070
and I don't who this he-man is
that you're referring to.

527
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,360
No, no, no, it's a "she."
My girlfriend.

528
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,690
That's who I'm talking about.

529
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,240
Rebel. Rebel Alley.
Where is she?

530
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,070
- Never met him.
- It's a she.

531
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,700
Nice try.
Now what are you doing here?

532
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,990
You gonna meet her here
with her son, maybe,

533
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,120
so her son can play
in the ball pit?

534
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,740
That's disgusting, Michael.

535
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,830
- This is no place for a child.
- I know what you do.

536
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,370
Mom told me
you were bragging about

537
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,750
seeing somebody in showbiz.

538
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,580
Then I see
a frozen dove in a freezer.

539
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,340
That could be anything.

540
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,000
It said "Love each other"
on the foot band.

541
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:42,300
Yeah, that does
sound like one of mine.

542
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,550
Whose freezer was it in?

543
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,300
Rebel. Rebel Alley's.
Nice try, Gob.

544
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,800
If I want to see bad acting,

545
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,600
I'll go see Tobias in
<i>A Jew Comes to Dinner.</i>

546
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,060
<i>But Gob wasn't acting.</i>

547
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,520
<i>He'd just forgotten</i>
<i>that he had met</i>

548
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,230
<i>a still-partying Rebel Alley.</i>

549
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:56,520
It's a little dove.
He's so cute.

550
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,190
<i>And Rebel returned home</i>
<i>to an unfortunate surprise.</i>

551
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:05,990
<i>She felt bad,</i>
<i>so quickly put it in a bag,</i>

552
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:08,320
<i>wrote down the species</i>
<i>and location</i>

553
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:11,870
<i>from which she'd acquired it</i>
<i>and then one further caution.</i>

554
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,120
<i>It was a merry mix-up.</i>

555
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,080
<i>But neither of them</i>
<i>knew any of this.</i>

556
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,130
Honestly, I have no idea what
you're talking about, Michael.

557
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,540
Yes, you do.
I got you dead to rights.

558
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,210
Dead to rights!

559
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,510
If ever we were gonna
have a fight, Michael,

560
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,510
this would be
the safest place to do it.

561
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,590
- Right! Let's do it! -This gay
bar would be the best...!

562
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,850
...something that can fillet a
chicken and subdue an intruder.

563
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:33,020
Let's do it!

564
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,400
Back to My Little Ballroom?

565
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,980
Yeah, this is the middle
of their workday.

566
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,940
Hey! Hey! Come back here!

567
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,690
You son of a bitch, Gob!

568
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:46,200
You'll never catch me, Michael!

569
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,370
♪ You raped and pushed
and struggled ♪

570
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:50,450
♪ All those balls in the air...♪

571
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:53,490
You have to find me, Michael!

572
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,910
♪ How hard can it be? ♪

573
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,620
Gob?

574
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,750
♪ ...those balls in the air ♪

575
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:05,010
♪ But keep those
balls in the air ♪

576
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:08,970
♪ Balls in the air. ♪

577
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:10,800
Are we done?

578
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,100
I'm just surprisingly tired.

579
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:15,020
So tired... and so not hurt.

580
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,270
Look, I'm not the guy, Michael.

581
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,350
I thought you'd be proud of me.
I did what you said.

582
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,770
I filled all your...
your houses.

583
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:22,940
Hang on-- filled 'em?

584
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,900
Every last one of 'em.

585
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:25,980
With who?

586
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:28,740
With sex offenders.

587
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,110
Hey! Hey!

588
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,450
Gob, you're out of the movie!

589
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:35,240
Thanks for ruining
my birthday party.

590
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:40,750
<i>After fighting with Gob,</i>

591
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,920
<i>Michael paid a return visit</i>
<i>to his mother.</i>

592
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,340
- What happened to your eye?
- Oh...

593
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,000
Is that from Gob?
Was I right about him?

594
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:48,090
No, actually.
Want to hear a funny story?

595
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:50,680
You're out of the movie.

596
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,010
Hold on, George.

597
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:53,180
I beg your pardon?

598
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,850
Did you say George?
Is that Dad?

599
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:56,520
'Cause he's the one
who told me to hire Gob.

600
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,180
I actually owe him a call.

601
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:59,480
Hey, Dad, how you doing?

602
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,310
Y-Yes, he did.

603
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,560
With sex offenders.

604
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:04,230
You want
to hear something funny?

605
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:06,360
You're out of the movie!

606
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,030
Want to hold for Mom? Yeah.

607
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:10,490
Bye.

608
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:14,530
<i>And later that night,</i>
<i>Gob went to win back the trust</i>

609
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:17,660
<i>of the man he was still</i>
<i>hoping to con.</i>

610
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,250
Hey, look...

611
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:20,910
<i>Although he quickly</i>
<i>lost sight of that plan.</i>

612
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,670
- You're mad at me.
- You stood me up.

613
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:26,880
Oh, no-- Siri sent me
to the wrong "Ballroom,"

614
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,800
and then I got in this fight
with my brother

615
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,630
that didn't hurt,
it was just a whole...

616
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:32,180
Oh, is that it?
Or is it because

617
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,430
your boyfriend is 20
and I'm nearly twice that?

618
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:36,470
You think that I care
that you're...

619
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:38,140
three years older than me?

620
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,230
No! I don't--
Check my phone. Check my phone.

621
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,850
I don't need to check
your phone; come on in.

622
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:43,480
<i>But getting Gob's boyfriend's</i>

623
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,610
<i>contact information</i>
<i>out of that phone</i>

624
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:47,690
<i>was the reason</i>
<i>for Tony's charade.</i>

625
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:49,360
He hates me;
the whole family hates me.

626
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,610
- Damn it!
<i>- Which he remembered too late.</i>

627
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:53,030
Yeah, damn it!

628
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,950
I mean, I even helped
fill his stupid homes

629
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:57,490
with sex offenders,
and yet he still hates me.

630
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:59,500
Sex offenders need
a place to live, too.

631
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:03,250
Yes! Exactly!
That's what I always say.

632
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:05,750
It's, like, God...
you get me.

633
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,750
Well, you're an easy guy to get.

634
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,550
I can't go home;
he's probably waiting for me.

635
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:10,880
He's gonna be my boss?

636
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,170
He's the younger brother.

637
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,130
- How old is he?
- 42.

638
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,510
Same!

639
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:17,550
My younger brother's 42, also.

640
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,600
Same!

641
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,140
But...

642
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,520
- I mean 32.
- Third... two...

643
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,930
- 32.
- 32! Same!

644
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,480
- Same! I was gonna say it.
- Same?

645
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,610
- I was thinking the same.
- That's so weird!

646
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,690
- ...same.
- ...same.

647
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:31,820
- Crazy!
- ...zy!

648
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,900
Do you want a glass of wine?

649
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:33,990
I love wine.

650
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,490
- Red wine?
- I love red wine!

651
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:36,620
- Same!
- Same!

652
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,830
It's, like, two same.

653
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:40,450
- That's in-same.
- Totally in-same.

654
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:42,500
<i>It turns out the guys</i>
<i>had tons in common.</i>

655
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,040
- That's so weird.
- ...weird.

656
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,790
- Like...
- Like...

657
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,710
...the last... time I went...

658
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,670
...scuba diving?

659
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:53,670
- Wow.
- Wow.

660
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:58,390
...eating... Captain Crunch.

661
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:00,350
- Same.
- Same.

662
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:01,930
<i>The hours melted away...</i>

663
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:03,480
I guess I must have been...

664
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,640
<i>...and perhaps,</i>
<i>pretending to be gay...</i>

665
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:06,350
...I don't know, 17...

666
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,560
<i>...allowed them the freedom</i>
<i>to speak honestly.</i>

667
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:10,440
...when I started saying "same."

668
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,190
- Same. -That's about
the same time I got into magic.

669
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,200
You know, I think I got into
misdirection 'cause I just...

670
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,030
maybe I was trying to hide
my feelings or something.

671
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:21,080
I was just doing it
to get out of gym.

672
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,830
Who's Jim?

673
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:23,910
No, I... phys ed.

674
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:25,500
Jealous!

675
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,870
- Oh... kidding.
- : Right.

676
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,330
Kidding.

677
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,630
- Ooh!
- Oh...

678
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,420
- Don't stop.
- Oh!

679
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,260
Popcorn fight!

680
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:47,520
It almost went down my throat.

681
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,730
I'll get some water.

682
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,610
- Yeah.
- Yeah, just...

683
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:57,900
<i>And Tony had</i>
<i>another opportunity</i>

684
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:01,620
<i>to get at Gob's phone.</i>

685
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,660
<i>And chose not to take it.</i>

686
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:07,830
<i>Gob also saw an opportunity to,</i>
<i>in some small way,</i>

687
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:10,750
<i>sabotage Tony's act.</i>

688
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:14,760
<i>And he also chose not to,</i>

689
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,340
<i>although he did put the mask</i>
<i>down his pants.</i>

690
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,510
Ah.

691
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:39,240
Ah.

692
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,370
We were really thirsty.

693
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:47,750
Well, I guess I should get go...

694
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:50,460
Yeah, I'd say stay,
but I just... I feel...

695
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,040
I just feel like we should
take it slow, you know.

696
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,540
Oh, same.

697
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:57,510
I-I would definitely stay
and have gay sex with...

698
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:59,130
or normal sex with you, but...

699
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:02,590
Yeah, I would totally have
gay sex or whatever, but...

700
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,970
just drank a lot of water,
you know.

701
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:08,680
I-I just... I just had
a lot of water, too.

702
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:10,350
Yeah, I don't want
to rush things.

703
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:12,020
- Same.
- Same.

704
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,980
You know, maybe we make
a date to do it

705
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,820
another time,
and tonight we just...

706
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,530
We can just sit and talk.

707
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:19,610
<i>Gob had never said anything</i>
<i>like that before.</i>

708
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:21,610
That would be amazing.

709
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:25,780
<i>And then he said something else</i>
<i>he'd never said before.</i>

710
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:29,950
I have... feelings for you.

711
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,540
I have feelings...

712
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,880
for you.

713
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,590
<i>The feeling was friendship,</i>

714
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,670
<i>but neither had ever</i>
<i>experienced it.</i>

715
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,760
<i>All they had to do now was</i>
<i>avoid making any specific...</i>

716
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,350
Why don't we have normal sex
on Cinco?

717
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:47,100
Let's have normal sex on Cinco.

718
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,640
<i>I guess they figured they could</i>
<i>get out of it later.</i>

719
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,350
<i>I'm not sure why</i>
<i>they said that.</i>

720
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:52,850
- Same!
- Same!

721
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,480
<i>It was</i>
<i>the Newport Beach celebration</i>

722
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,980
<i>of Cinco de Cuatro,</i>

723
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:01,440
<i>and after taking care</i>
<i>of some business,</i>

724
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:03,910
<i>- Gob ran into an almost</i>
<i>ex-wife.</i>-No, honey, on Cinco,

725
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:06,120
we break the stick
and not the piñata. Okay, look.

726
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,080
Whoo! Huh?

727
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,540
Well...

728
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,160
How long has it been?

729
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,210
- It's been five years.
- What are you doing here?

730
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:16,130
I'm taking my five-year-old
to see<i>Fantastic Four.</i>

731
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,710
I'm pretty sure
that's an adult...

732
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,130
Wait, you have a five-year-old?

733
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,260
<i>Oui.</i>

734
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,720
What? We what?

735
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,380
No, <i>oui.</i>
It's French for "yes."

736
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:25,970
As in, "Yes, I have a son,

737
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:28,470
and his father's a magician."

738
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,440
Oh. It's not us.

739
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,070
Don't worry. It's not you.

740
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,780
It was a real magician.

741
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,530
He took advantage
of how angry I was

742
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:45,280
when you wouldn't come out
of that cave.

743
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,120
He promised me
a life together, and after

744
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,660
he had his way with me,
he never wanted to see me again.

745
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,540
I don't think
there's anything wonderful

746
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,410
about Tony Wonder.

747
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,080
Are you kidding me?
Are you saying...

748
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,040
- Yes.
- Tony's straight?

749
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:01,130
<i>Gob felt betrayed by a person</i>
<i>he was starting to trust,</i>

750
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:03,050
<i>and he decided</i>
<i>to do something about it.</i>

751
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:06,840
How would you like to spend
the night making revenge love?

752
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:09,050
Uh, Jacqueline,
could you, uh...?

753
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:12,770
<i>With a plan to get revenge</i>
<i>on Tony Wonder taking shape,</i>

754
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:14,890
<i>Gob met with Ann</i>
<i>at the model home.</i>

755
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,310
I'm ready, Gob.

756
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,900
Yeah, okay, well,
don't get ready yet.

757
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:21,480
Uh, Tony's not
going to be here for a bit.

758
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,940
Tony?

759
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:25,820
You're having sex
with Tony Wonder tonight.

760
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:28,410
Well, I-I thought
we were having sex.

761
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:30,410
Oh. Uh, no, thank you.

762
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:33,080
Listen, here's the plan--
this house is wired

763
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,580
with hidden cameras
from<i>Entrap a Local Predator.</i>

764
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:38,880
There, there, there and there.

765
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,670
We're going to destroy
Tony's career

766
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:43,590
by proving that he's straight
when he has sex with you

767
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:45,630
while you're wearing...

768
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:47,550
this Gob mask.

769
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:49,300
Oh, and this little black
mini-robe.

770
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:52,600
Just to really sell
that you're a man.

771
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,310
Why would I wear a Gob mask?

772
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,560
Because Tony's coming here
expecting to have sex with me.

773
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,770
Look, in the act of having
fake gay sex,

774
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:01,770
you're going to take off
the mask to reveal

775
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,530
that you're having
real straight sex,

776
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:05,740
destroying his career,
and it's all going to be

777
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,860
captured on that camera
right there.

778
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,240
I don't want to have sex
with Tony.

779
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,910
Aren't you just a little cur...?

780
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,240
I have a child with him!

781
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:16,500
Okay, yes, new plan.

782
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:19,330
I'm going to wear
this Tony Wonder mask,

783
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:22,420
you're going to wear
the Gob mask, and...

784
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,800
I am going to have sex with you.

785
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,510
I'm sorry about all that.

786
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:29,380
And then, again, you're
going to rip off the Gob mask,

787
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,930
and the world will think
that he's straight,

788
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:32,140
and it'll ruin his career.

789
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,220
That's great.

790
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,560
Much simpler plan, thank you.

791
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,640
But the main event
is us having this...

792
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:40,770
pretend gay
but actually straight sex.

793
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:41,900
And you know what it is?

794
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,230
It's a straight bait.

795
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,900
I just realized,
it's a straight bait.

796
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,320
You ever watch those?

797
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,200
Good, and let me
have the room, yeah.

798
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,780
I need a little while
to get same.

799
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:56,040
To be the same.

800
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,290
<i>Downstairs, however,</i>
<i>Tony had arrived early...</i>

801
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,210
Hello? Hello?

802
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:02,630
<i>...and was looking</i>
<i>for a place to pop out of</i>

803
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:04,290
<i>in case Gob said "Wonder."</i>

804
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,960
- That piece of sh...
- Tony?

805
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:09,720
Hey... you.

806
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,050
It's Ann.

807
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:13,050
Awfully funny time
to run into you.

808
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:17,310
Yes, it is an awfully funny time
to see you, too...

809
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:19,230
you.

810
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:20,980
I know I owe you child support.

811
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,770
Don't worry, I got
something big in the works.

812
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:24,980
Actually,
that's why I came here.

813
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,900
- What are you doing here?
- Gob invited me.

814
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:29,190
He's planning
on getting revenge on you.

815
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,400
He would never do that.

816
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:34,780
Then why did he want to have sex
with me with this on?

817
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:37,040
Wait a minute.

818
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,080
Sex with you?

819
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,080
Gob is straight?

820
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,250
Oh, yeah, he is.

821
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,840
- Tony?
- I just... Why would he do that?

822
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,460
I thought he was gay.

823
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,800
- Tony, you're not gay, either.
- That's business.

824
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,970
Why do you think David Geffen
pretends to be gay?

825
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:54,550
You think
the Shubert Organization

826
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:56,220
would entrust a project
like<i>Dreamgirls</i>

827
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,720
to a straight producer?

828
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,520
How do you know so much
about<i>Dreamgirls?</i>

829
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,430
'Cause it's my business
to know about<i>Dreamgirls.</i>

830
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,270
And if you wanted to be
in a film version

831
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:06,400
of a musical called
<i>The Magic Show,</i> done in 1974

832
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,980
by another secretly straight guy
named Doug Henning,

833
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:10,740
you'd make it
your business, too.

834
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,110
I mean,
they can't give everything

835
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:13,360
to Doogie Howser, right?

836
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,450
Biggest fake gay there is,
by the way.

837
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:18,120
But if I fund it,
then they can't say no to me.

838
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,240
But it's big money--
I mean, 20, 30, 40 mil.

839
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:21,620
Fakeblock money.

840
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,250
I can't believe
I'm telling you all this.

841
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:25,250
I... I've been
overexplaining the

842
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:26,460
out of everything lately.

843
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,920
You can't tell a soul.

844
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,460
No one I know will care.

845
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,010
Look, do you want
to out Gob as gay

846
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:34,130
so it'll ruin his career
as the Christian magician?

847
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,510
- Yes, of course.
- Are you still your own legs?

848
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:38,930
And do you have toenail polish
on you right now?

849
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:41,680
Are you asking, am I wearing
any, or do I have any extra?

850
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,520
Because the answer
to both questions is yes.

851
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,020
Then we're covered.
You and I will have sex.

852
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,560
And you wear this Gob mask, and
I'll wear a Tony Wonder mask.

853
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:50,030
Okay, I have two questions.

854
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:52,110
Are you going to
move this time?

855
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:55,860
Why can't I just be me
and you wear the Gob mask?

856
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:59,450
I just thought that if you
had to have sex with a man,

857
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:01,370
wouldn't it be more of a turn-on

858
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:03,910
to have sex with someone
that looks like you?

859
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:06,830
Okay.

860
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,920
Put these on,
and then meet me in the bedroom

861
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,960
in five minutes for some serious
secular intercourse.

862
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:13,340
With myself.

863
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:16,130
Yeah.

864
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,810
- Same.
- Same.

865
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:31,070
- Same.
- Same.

866
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:33,530
<i>And two men who never loved</i>
<i>anyone but themselves...</i>

867
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:36,320
- Same. Same.
- Become... the same.

868
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:40,240
<i>...prepared to ruin</i>
<i>each other's reputation.</i>

869
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,660
- Same.
- Same.

870
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,910
- Same.
- Same.

871
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,830
I should dim the lights.

872
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:52,040
<i>And that's how Ann</i>
<i>not only performed</i>

873
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:56,050
<i>a real-life version of Tony's</i>
<i>most beloved illusion...</i>

874
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:57,880
Now everybody's gay!

875
00:32:57,930 --> 00:33:00,890
<i>...but was responsible</i>
<i>for the first reported instance</i>

876
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:04,100
<i>of a Christian</i>
<i>straight-to-gay conversion.</i>

877
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,730
<i>Gob went downstairs</i>
<i>to take a forget-me-now...</i>

878
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:13,650
Is that you, Maria?

879
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:16,650
<i>...when he bumped into a</i>
<i>brother who also had a secret.</i>

880
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:18,860
We did make quite a mess
in that bedroom.

881
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:20,700
- Michael.
- Gob?

882
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,740
<i>And relished the opportunity</i>
<i>to rub it in.</i>

883
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:25,450
Besides, you could not make me
feel worse right now.

884
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:27,040
I'd be willing
to let you have your

885
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,830
apology back if you give me
the chance to try.

886
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:31,750
Bad example. If you were ashamed
of being in love with a man,

887
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:34,170
suddenly discovered
these new feelings,

888
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:35,590
something that you only
allowed to happen because

889
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,340
you thought he was gay
and you were hoping

890
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:40,140
to exact revenge, but then
you found out he was straight,

891
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:42,550
then you wanted to get even,
so maybe you put a mask

892
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,220
on someone and then tried
to convince yourself

893
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,390
that the sex you were
about to have was with yourself,

894
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:49,060
but it turned out to be him,
and all you ended up doing

895
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,190
was proving that your feelings
were real...

896
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:53,150
then I might say something like,
"Homo much?"

897
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:55,400
- It's not that.
- I said, "Bad example."

898
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,820
Hey, listen, Michael,
if you want,

899
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,150
- we can split this.
- No.

900
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:00,070
Believe me,
this is the last time I ever

901
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,360
judge you for anything

902
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:02,370
that you ever do.

903
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:04,280
Oh, .

904
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:06,790
Is that who you were with?

905
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:09,210
<i>And Gob decided to be generous</i>

906
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:11,670
<i>- with his last forget-me-now...</i>
- : No!

907
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,880
<i>and for the first time,</i>
<i>it was Michael</i>

908
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,960
<i>who forgot his shame,</i>
<i>and Gob who remembered.</i>

909
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:18,920
Stupid, forgetful Michael.

910
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:24,680
<i>Michael wakes up and is</i>
<i>reminded of something horrible.</i>

911
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,560
700,000. Think about it.

912
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,140
That is a very big number.

913
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,100
700,000 abortions every year...

914
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,850
<i>The amount of money he owed</i>

915
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:36,190
<i>because Tobias wanted</i>
<i>to mount this abortion.</i>

916
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:38,440
♪ Fantastic Three,
Fantastic... ♪

917
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,650
<i>And he does something that</i>
<i>he never thought he'd do...</i>

918
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,360
Vote for Lucille!

919
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:44,820
Hey, Lucille 2.

920
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:47,830
I was hoping that
we could get together

921
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:50,870
and talk about how I can
repay you that loan.

922
00:34:50,910 --> 00:34:53,580
<i>...and had already done.</i>

923
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,750
<i>And then, with nothing</i>
<i>left to lose,</i>

924
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:57,380
<i>he makes another call.</i>

925
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,460
Rebel. Yeah, Michael.

926
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:01,050
I need to come over.

927
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:02,800
I'm... I don't want to act

928
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:06,050
like it doesn't matter
to me anymore, 'cause it does.

929
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,470
Well, there's somebody here
right now.

930
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:08,850
I don't care.

931
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:10,390
The thing with
the other guy, it's...

932
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:12,190
you know, that's over,
so we don't...

933
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:14,520
we don't ever have to talk
about that ever again.

934
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,900
It's going away.

935
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:18,860
Okay, well, you can
come over later, okay?

936
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,320
- Good-bye.
- I'll see you soon.

937
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,370
Who was that?

938
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:27,530
No one.
