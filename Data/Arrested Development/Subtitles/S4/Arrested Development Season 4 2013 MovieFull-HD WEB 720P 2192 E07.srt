<i>Hollywood Boulevard at night</i>

2
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,660
<i>is the playground of the hip,</i>
<i>young and successful.</i>

3
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:24,000
<i>It was into this world that</i>
<i>Gob Bluth had finally arrived,</i>

4
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,210
<i>surrounded for</i>
<i>the first time in his life</i>

5
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,750
<i>by a group of admirers</i>

6
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:31,840
<i>that comprised L.A.'s</i>
<i>latest young elite.</i>

7
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,800
<i>There was Mark, a pop star</i>
<i>who had a level of fame</i>

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,390
<i>he could neither appreciate</i>
<i>nor handle.</i>

9
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,890
<i>Trout, a Southern boy who had</i>

10
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:43,810
<i>a Northern man's</i>
<i>taste in women.</i>

11
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:48,270
<i>J.B.J., a weekend weatherman,</i>
<i>all-week party boy</i>

12
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:51,440
<i>and a huge disappointment</i>
<i>to his father.</i>

13
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,280
<i>Chris K,</i>
<i>who was a lot like Trout,</i>

14
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,280
<i>but without the accent.</i>

15
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,910
<i>Oakwood, a studio teacher,</i>

16
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,910
<i>who might have had</i>
<i>his own entourage,</i>

17
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:02,410
<i>if his part hadn't been cut</i>

18
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:04,290
<i>from the pilot of</i>
Modern Family.

19
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:07,790
<i>And, of course, there was</i>
<i>the man they called Getaway.</i>

20
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:10,790
<i>Gob had come far in the year</i>
<i>since his girlfriend,</i>

21
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,540
<i>was less than an hour</i>
<i>from turning 18.</i>

22
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,550
Let me run the clock down
on this thing.

23
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,260
Why don't you just go change
into something a little less...

24
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,010
unflattering, and... I'll, uh...

25
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:22,510
<i>And he was getting everyone</i>
<i>in the mood for romance.</i>

26
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,310
Guess I'll take my clothes off.

27
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,770
<i>While Ann</i>
<i>less-unflattered herself up,</i>

28
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:28,680
<i>Gob had an unexpected visitor--</i>

29
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:31,600
<i>Ann's ex-boyfriend</i>
<i>George Michael,</i>

30
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:34,190
<i>who, as it turned out,</i>
<i>hadn't completely let go</i>

31
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,400
<i>of the relationship.</i>

32
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:39,200
You're lucky that I'm chasing

33
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,490
after our girlfriend,
or I'd have to flatten you!

34
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,580
Whew! Way to plant, Ann.

35
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,370
You told me George Michael
knew about us.

36
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:50,790
Well, he does now,
my darling plant.

37
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:51,790
Ann.

38
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,380
And...

39
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,670
after I dazzle everyone tonight
on the<i>Queen Mary,</i>

40
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,550
my magic career will take off

41
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,380
as surely as there's a mouse
behind your ear.

42
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,350
Well, as surely as there's
a mouse behind your ear.

43
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,600
Mouse behind...

44
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,230
Okay, you are like
the only person I know

45
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,060
who doesn't just love magic.

46
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:18,150
<i>A poll would confirm</i>
<i>she was far from alone.</i>

47
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,690
...for the fifth year in a row,

48
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,200
your least favorite
entertainers are...

49
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,660
magicians.

50
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,950
A close second,
talk show side-kicks.

51
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,530
Hmph!

52
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,750
- you, too, America.
- ...'cause I quit.

53
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,370
Well, you have to make things
right with George Michael,

54
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,080
otherwise you don't get
to fourth base.

55
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,090
<i>Of course, Ann's concept</i>
<i>of fourth base...</i>

56
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,590
<i>...was very different</i>
<i>than Gob's.</i>

57
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:44,090
But you have to promise me
you'll always be faithful.

58
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,970
Faithful?
Of course I can be faithful.

59
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,720
Until tonight, when we're
together, you know...

60
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,310
Oh! Until tonight!

61
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:52,270
Well, of course I can be
faithful-- don't be stupid.

62
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,060
You think I can't
keep it in my pants

63
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,310
in front of a bunch of
doggy old women and my family?

64
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,610
Don't be stupid.

65
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,280
Who am I gonna hit on, stupid?

66
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,030
My sister? Lindsay?

67
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,650
Don't be stupid.

68
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,360
She's my sister; that's gross.

69
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,490
Now...

70
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:09,080
you...

71
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,210
have got some mice
to scoop out of the sea.

72
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,710
<i>Now the story of a family</i>

73
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,000
<i>whose future</i>
<i>was abruptly canceled,</i>

74
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,590
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice</i>

75
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,010
<i>but to keep himself together.</i>

76
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,220
<i>It's Gob's</i>
Arrested Development.

77
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,770
<i>On the day</i>
<i>of the</i>Queen Mary<i>party,</i>

78
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,600
<i>Gob remained faithful to Ann,</i>

79
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,230
<i>even in the face</i>
<i>of tremendous temptation.</i>

80
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,730
- Unrelated.
<i>- But there would be</i>

81
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:42,780
<i>no career-making magic show.</i>

82
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,200
<i>It seemed the only "her"</i>

83
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,610
<i>Gob would be</i>
<i>getting off that day</i>

84
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,990
<i>was the</i>Queen Mary.

85
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,740
But then the<i>Queen</i>
changed course,

86
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,700
heading back to shore
before crashing into the jetty

87
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,250
and leaving most
of its occupants all wet.

88
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,870
I want all of these
on the insurance form, okay?

89
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,290
These are all part of an act
I was going to do.

90
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:59,500
Two drowned white doves,
for "flowers to doves."

91
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:04,130
This was a rabbit, for "doves to
rabbit"-- also drowned.

92
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:05,260
These were mice...

93
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,550
For "rabbit to mice."

94
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:11,390
No, that can't be done.

95
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,810
No, these were
part of a something

96
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,100
I called "Mice-a-laneous."

97
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:17,520
"Mouse in purse."
"Mouse in drink."

98
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,860
"Here's a mouse, now it's gone."

99
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,650
How'd he do dat?

100
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:25,150
<i>But it was another man that Gob</i>

101
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,570
<i>needed to make things</i>
<i>right with...</i>

102
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,360
George Michael...

103
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,620
<i>...if he was ever going</i>
<i>to deflower Ann Veal.</i>

104
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,540
Uncle Gob.

105
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,910
Are we good?

106
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,040
No.

107
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,500
No, how could we possibly be?

108
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,420
But... but are we, are we good?

109
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,090
No!
You stole my girlfriend.

110
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:46,880
That's a tough thing,
and, you know,

111
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,430
sometimes you have to ask
- "Are we good?"

112
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,390
Is it over between you guys?

113
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,060
Oh, no.
But are we good?

114
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,560
I don't know what you want
to hear from me, Uncle Gob.

115
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,640
- I mean, yes, we are good...
- There it is!

116
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:58,980
There it is!

117
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,650
Ah, from a nephew to his uncle,

118
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:03,230
and just the "yes,"
the much-vaunted "yes,"

119
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,480
that he gets.

120
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:05,900
Look at you, full of "yes."

121
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,950
Look at how much "yes"
is in you!

122
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,820
I knew it! I knew I'd get
that "yes" from you.

123
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,570
Look who got a "yes"!
Got my "yes."

124
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:15,410
<i>And Gob realized that there was</i>
<i>finally nothing</i>

125
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,210
<i>standing in the way</i>
<i>of a loving,</i>

126
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,540
<i>committed relationship</i>
<i>with Ann.</i>

127
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:28,420
♪ Hello, darkness,
my old friend ♪

128
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,970
♪ I've come to talk with... ♪

129
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:34,220
<i>So, that night,</i>
<i>as he broke into her house</i>

130
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,470
<i>to break up with her...</i>

131
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:39,020
Gob...!

132
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,480
For a second, I thought
that was a real guy.

133
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,900
So, listen, I talked to George
Michael and everything's cool.

134
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,110
I need to tell you something,
though.

135
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,360
I've been doing some thinking

136
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,700
and I... I just don't...

137
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,950
<i>But as she unzipped</i>
<i>her pajamas,</i>

138
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:54,620
<i>it reminded him</i>
<i>of past situations</i>

139
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:58,500
<i>which he'd successfully</i>
<i>been aroused.</i>

140
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,120
Well, I could wait till after.

141
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,340
<i>And later, Gob once again tried</i>
<i>to find a compassionate way</i>

142
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,590
<i>to end the relationship.</i>

143
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,180
So how did you like your egg?

144
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,800
I said you were fine.

145
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,140
So, was there something you
wanted to talk about

146
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,810
when you came in through
my window?

147
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:20,060
Gob, what is it?

148
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:26,020
What... what... is it?

149
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,530
I... You...

150
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:32,950
It's the-the-the-the-the...
the-the questions...

151
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,660
you ask so many...

152
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,740
of these, of these, of these,
these-these questions

153
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:42,750

Listen, we had
a great night together.

169
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,290
I understand if you need
your freedom.

170
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:27,340
Well... marry me.

00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:31,010
Yes, I'll...
yes, I'll marry you, Gob!

172
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,920
<i>Of course, Gob meant it</i>
<i>in the showbizzy way</i>

173
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,470
<i>his niece had always used</i>

174
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:37,050
<i>when she was accused</i>
<i>of being too young.</i>

175
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,260
What, are you, like, 15?

176
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,100
- Marry me! -...marry me!
- ...marry me!

177
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,850
- marry me.
- ...marry me.

178
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:44,980
<i>But like many evangelicals,</i>
<i>Ann took it literally.</i>

179
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,900
I'm getting married!

180
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,360
<i>Gob was surrounded</i>
<i>by unconditional love</i>

181
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,200
<i>from a family,</i>
<i>for the first time in his life.</i>

182
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:07,380
♪ Hello, darkness,
my old friend... ♪

183
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,880
I've made a huge mistake.

184
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:17,800
<i>Gob shared his happy news</i>
<i>at a meeting with his family.</i>

185
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,390
I'm sure Gob helped himself
to the money.

186
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,140
Hey, I got mouths to feed.

187
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,180
Mouths?

188
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,230
Mouth.

189
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,690
Her.

190
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,810
Oh, hey, mouth.
I didn't see you sitting there.

191
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:30,270
We rode up
in the elevator together.

192
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,440
I'm blanking.

193
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,320
Yeah, me and Blank are getting

194
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,240
the old Christian magic act
back together.

195
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,900
I mean, you don't expect people
to actually believe

196
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,450
that I'm Jesus,
if I'm walking around in rags.

197
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,660
You're resurrecting
that mumbo-jumbo?

198
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,330
Look, everybody's got a gimmick.

199
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:47,330
Tony Wonder's making a fortune
with that gay magician act.

200
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:50,920
<i>Gob's long-time nemesis</i>
<i>had come out of the closet</i>

201
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,630
<i>and used it to great advantage</i>
<i>in his act.</i>

202
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,010
Besides, I have to do something
for the wedding.

203
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:57,510
Who's getting married?

204
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,630
Her!

205
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,970
Who's marrying her?

206
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,760
Me.

207
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,770
- Did I not open with that?
- You sure didn't.

208
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,680
Yeah, I'm getting married!

209
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,230
I didn't want
to make a big deal about it.

210
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,940
- You haven't.
- Well, my wedding's

211
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,740
going to be religious-y and epic
and expensive,

212
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,990
which is why I need more of that
stimmy-mummy.

213
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,620
Thanks, Mike.

214
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:25,790
<i>And perhaps it was</i>
<i>all the talk of spirituality</i>

215
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:26,830
<i>that led to this.</i>

216
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,170
And welcome to

217
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:34,210
<i>And As It Is Such, So Also</i>
<i>As Such Is It Unto You.</i>

218
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,840
Excuse me, Father Marsala,
I hate to interrupt,

219
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,380
but I am so excited today.

220
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:40,760
My lovely Ann...

221
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,100
- Who?
- My daughter.

222
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,390
Oh. I didn't know
you had a daughter.

223
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,180
You've met her several times.

224
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,560
Oh.

225
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,690
She's sitting right next to you.

226
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,020
Oh!

227
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,400
That's why she's there.

228
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,610
I thought you were Hair.

229
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,530
Hair?

230
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:59,780
No, she's my daughter,
and she's getting married!

231
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,200
To this good man.

232
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:03,700
Well, and as it is such,

233
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,790
so also as such is it
unto you, young man.

234
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,290
You got it.

235
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:10,620
Unto you, as well...
dear f... heavenly fathers.

236
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,710
Well, we have
a really great show today

237
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,960
surrounding the Scriptures...

238
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,250
We have an announcement to make.

239
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:16,960
I have an announcement to make:

240
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,840
that we would like to televise
our marriage, here on this show.

241
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,600
My goodness.

242
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,060
Oh, um... we hadn't heard of it.

243
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,220
Did you...?

244
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,480
Well, no, but that's... no...

245
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,850
What an idea. I think...

246
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:33,980
Well, this show is about
the spirit of inclusion,

247
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,440
- so I would love to say...
- Well, great!

248
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,610
Then I, too,
have an announcement to make!

249
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:39,110
At our wedding,
I will be performing

250
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:42,450
one of my
famous magical illusions.

251
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:44,490
That once your eyes
have beholden it,

252
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:46,330
you will put no god before me,

253
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:48,910
because of its spectacularity.

254
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:55,840
And, of course, I only propose
to do this out of love for...

255
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,130
Ann.

256
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:00,260
And... God.

257
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,840
Love for and God.

258
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,850
Let me pray.
Dearest beloved gods...

259
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:10,470
<i>Gob was feeling bolder,</i>
<i>which was perhaps why</i>

260
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,060
<i>Michael returned home</i>
<i>to find this.</i>

261
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,810
And yea, as if to be arisen

262
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:19,980
the third or fourth day with all
the magic of Jesus Christ!

263
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:22,860
Sorry.
Wasn't on there too good.

264
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,660
You okay?

265
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,160
Yeah, it's just part of my...
illusion for the wedding.

266
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,410
Yeah, what's the illusion?

267
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:29,620
That you actually
love the bride?

268
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:33,250
Hey...
that's good patter.

269
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:36,210
'Cause I need people to root
for the Jesus character.

270
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,380
I don't remember
a biblical passage where Jesus

271
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,840
came out of a boulder--
is it in there?

272
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,050
Oh, no, no, no,
the boulder's my escape plan.

273
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:42,170
They think I'm somewhere else.

274
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,720
I'm actually in the boulder.

275
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,180
But I didn't come here to talk

276
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,590
- about my magic act, Michael.
- Okay.

277
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,560
I came to ask you
to be my best man...

278
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,560
slash-assistant.

279
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,350
And then we'll walk through
the act later, of course.

280
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:55,230
- I mean, not now.
- No, we're not going to,

281
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,940
'cause you know,
I'm out of the family.

282
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,190
Did you not get that
when I announced it

283
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,900
over at Mom's place?

284
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,780
I feel like I was out
of the room at that point.

285
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,320
I am done with this family.

286
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,570
I hope you've saved some money
'cause you...

287
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:08,370
♪ Hello, darkness,
my old friend... ♪

288
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,280
<i>Well, the gist of it was:</i>

289
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,830
"You know what?
I'm done with this family.

290
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,580
"I hope you saved your money
'cause you're

291
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,460
going to need
every last dime now."

292
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,040
Maybe you could be a centurion,

293
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,170
kind of standing over
where they think that I'll be.

294
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:20,710
I'm not going to be in the act.

295
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,920
Might be a great promotion
for the Bluth Company.

296
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,420
No, Bluth Company's done.

297
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:25,840
Michael B. Company.

298
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,340
I have a bee company.

299
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,180
You stole my idea?

300
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,510
Uh-uh, I did not steal your...

301
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,310
We sell...
It would take hours.

302
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:34,390
How's that going, by the way?

303
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:36,020
Uh, not so good.

304
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,690
I've been keeping the bees
in my apartment.

305
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,980
I was using my magic smoke
on them.

306
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,400
And my bees are dropping
like flies,

307
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,440
and I need them to fly
like bees.

308
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,110
And so I've got them out
at a bee hospital,

309
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,400
which is not cheap,
which is another reason

310
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,860
I need to be a famous magician.

311
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,910
Yeah, well, listen,
you're with my son's ex,

312
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,490
so I can't support the wedding.

313
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:55,790
What if I don't actually
get married?

314
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:57,750
I don't think you'd need
a best man, then, right?

315
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,000
No, I guess, at that point,

316
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,250
it'd really be more...
assistant.

317
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,750
Is this an escape act?

318
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,880
- Are you running again?
- What do you want from me?

319
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,630
Marriage is a lot of pressure,
and she's not into it.

320
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,380
Meanwhile, I'm working out
like crazy,

321
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,350
my diet has become insane,

322
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:15,100
and this Jesus character--
I mean, he was shredded.

323
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,020
Meanwhile, we have sex one time,

324
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,520
and then she's just,
you know, over it.

325
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,810
Lets herself go.

326
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,820
Her stomach's out to here.

327
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:26,440
You know, your whole life
is an escape act,

328
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:28,650
and this girl seems
like she really likes you.

329
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,780
Why don't you just try
to work it out

330
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,200
and just stop running...?

331
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,710
Yeah, I know you're
in the boulder.

332
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,750
But how'd I get in the boulder?

333
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,670
<i>And on the day of the wedding,</i>

334
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:43,960
<i>even though Gob</i>
<i>didn't take it seriously,</i>

335
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,960
<i>he was a little hurt</i>
<i>to discover</i>

336
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:48,920
<i>no one else</i>
<i>in his family did, either.</i>

337
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:51,010
<i>I know it's bad luck for you</i>

338
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:53,430
to see me in my gown
before the wedding.

339
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:56,560
Well, hopefully I haven't.

340
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,560
You're angry.

341
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,640
Why? Because none of my family
has shown up

342
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:02,940
and the only person I recognize
out there is Tony Wonder,

343
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,110
who's only shown up
hoping that I'd fail?

344
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:08,490
I don't know what
your surprise trick is, but...

345
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:10,240
I know it's going to be great.

346
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,620
And as for your family...
you have a new family now.

347
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,290
I don't want these.

348
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,290
- Tobias!
- Gob.

349
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:24,630
- Thanks for coming.
- Oh, how could I not?

350
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,630
I'm playing
Roman Centurion Number Two.

351
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:29,090
- What are you playing?
- I'm the groom.

352
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:30,510
I didn't know there
was a groom part.

353
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,720
You know, Betty
at<i>And As It Is Such,</i>

354
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,680
<i>So Also As Such</i>
<i>Is It Unto You</i>casting

355
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,220
told me this was all biblical.

356
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,020
Wait, you're not here
for the wedding?

357
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:41,230
Well, thank you very much
for your vote of confidence.

358
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,150
I'll have you know I've worked
for the Miracle Network

359
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,650
a number of times.

360
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:46,150
<i>Coming up next:</i>

361
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,280
<i>Father Marsala's</i>
<i>searing docudrama,</i>

362
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,740
Father Marsala's
John the Baptist.

363
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,910
<i>Then the antiabortion drama,</i>

364
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:56,450
It Would Have Been
a Wonderful Life.

365
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,660
<i>And later,</i>
<i>break out the bagels.</i>

366
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,500
<i>It's time for Father M's</i>
<i>lighthearted comedy,</i>

367
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,620
- A Jew Came to Dinner.
- <i>I hate to be</i>

368
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,250
<i>the guy who quotes</i>
<i>his own reviews,</i>

369
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:07,420
but<i>His Word</i>magazine...

370
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,590
called my Jew "pitiful."

371
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,420
<i>But soon,</i>

372
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:13,800
<i>the wedding began.</i>

373
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,760
So, it truly is a blessed day.

374
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,720
I believe that we
are all blessed,

375
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,310
uh, to be gathering here

376
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:22,560
at the Church
of the Holy Eternal Rapture.

377
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,940
Uh, we have almost arrived
at that glorious moment

378
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,650
where we join together
these two very special people,

379
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:31,360
but first, my almost son-in-law

380
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,400
has something he'd like
to share with all of us,

381
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:36,410
so, um...

382
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:38,700
ladies and gentlemen, uh,

383
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:42,330
please enjoy a magical...

384
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:44,410
uh, trick.

385
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,380
Thanks for that killer intro.

386
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:58,100
It's true,
this is a magical trick.

387
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:01,520
If what Jesus did was a trick.

388
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,020
I say it wasn't.

389
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,940
It was an illusion.

390
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,240
Ooh, they did not like that one.

391
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,660
I don't take notes from you,
Centurion Number Two.

392
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,080
Just turn this thing around.

393
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:25,620
I am not the real Jesus.

394
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:35,260
I am the Amazing Jesus!

395
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:40,430
No? I thought that that
would be up your... alley.

396
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,310
Yes, the real Jesus

397
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:44,770
came off the cross
and went into his cave...

398
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,600
a dead man.

399
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,060
<i>And Gob's escape boulder</i>

400
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,770
<i>was wheeled up to the trick.</i>

401
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,740
But was he crazy enough
to do it... handcuffed?

402
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,150
Handcuff the King of the Jews!

403
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,490
You don't have words here...

404
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:02,620
Pastor Veal, if you don't mind,
please go up into the cave

405
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,540
and assure everyone
that there's no way to escape:

406
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,870
no trapdoors,
no secret compartments,

407
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,380
no way to get out.

408
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,630
Thank you very...

409
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,130
Pastor Veal, let me remind you

410
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:15,670
that you are in a church
in front of your daughter,

411
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,880
your congregation, God.

412
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:19,430
You cannot tell a lie.

413
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:24,810
Right, nothing
out of the ordinary?

414
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,690
- No, I-I didn't see anything.
- Yes.

415
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:33,730
Jesus went into the cave,
and he arose three days later.

416
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:36,150
But I'm not going to lock myself
in the cave

417
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,900
for three days
before this wedding ceremony.

418
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:40,780
No, no. No, no, no.

419
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:44,490
I plan on beating his record
by two full weeks!

420
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,060
Into the cave with you!

421
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,390
No, I said don't underline
the "you" in that.

422
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,810
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>Gob was not able to open</i>

423
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:14,520
<i>the secret compartment that</i>
<i>contained the handcuff key.</i>

424
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,520
It's not going to work. Okay,
uh, this isn't going to work.

425
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,110
Let's do...
let's do mouse in drink.

426
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:19,610
Let's do mouse in drink.
Just get these people

427
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:21,200
some drinks.
We'll just get a mouse.

428
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,370
No, no, no. No, no, no,
you know not what you do!

429
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:27,200
<i>But it very clearly said</i>
<i>in the centurions' script</i>

430
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,290
<i>to ignore</i>
<i>the magician's protests,</i>

431
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:32,370
<i>which meant that,</i>
<i>still handcuffed...</i>

432
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,420
But if my hands are handcuffed,
I'll never...

433
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,500
<i>...Gob was unable</i>
<i>to break his fall</i>

434
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,050
<i>and was therefore</i>
<i>knocked unconscious.</i>

435
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:40,220
<i>And as the Gob dummy</i>

436
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,800
<i>was sealed inside the cave,</i>

437
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,800
<i>the real Gob's fate</i>
<i>was sealed, as well.</i>

438
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,560
Well, I guess...
we'll wait two weeks...

439
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,610
...and see if he's in there.

440
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:01,490
Is that okay with you, Ann?

441
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:04,070
He's not coming back.

442
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,790
<i>Gob was stuck</i>
<i>inside a fake boulder in</i>

443
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,620
<i>- the parking lot of a church,</i>
- Hey, kids.

444
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,540
<i>while inside the church,</i>
<i>the daily routine</i>

445
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:15,000
<i>- proceeded as usual</i>
- I-18.

446
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:18,460
<i>- and the anticipation grew</i>
<i>to a fevered pitch.</i>-I-18.

447
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,590
11 exciting days, um,

448
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:23,840
although nothing's
really happened.

449
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,390
Day 11.

450
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,510
Once he gets out,
it's going to be

451
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:30,180
a beautiful, beautiful wedding.

452
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,350
He's not coming back.

453
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:36,310
<i>But it was Betty</i>
<i>from</i>And As It Is Such,

454
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,770
So Also As Such Is It Unto You
<i>that would render Gob's</i>

455
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,820
<i>- escape act a disaster.</i>-You
got to get rid of this thing.

456
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,900
- I got Mrs. Murray's trailer
here. -I guess, if he comes back

457
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,570
from the dead,
we could just get a stepladder.

458
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:46,030
- Guys, this, too.
<i>- And a hoarse,</i>

459
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:48,240
<i>weakened Gob was unable</i>
<i>to stop them</i>

460
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:52,290
<i>as the boulder was shipped</i>
<i>to a storage unit in Tustin.</i>

461
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:54,370
<i>Although a keen eye could see</i>

462
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:57,290
<i>that Gob was alive</i>
<i>but not well.</i>

463
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:00,250
<i>And that's why this</i>
<i>particular chair was empty</i>

464
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,590
<i>at the trial of Lucille Bluth.</i>

465
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,300
Well, I can't thank you
all enough for returning...

466
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,090
<i>At the end of two weeks,</i>
<i>the big day</i>

467
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:07,550
<i>- finally arrived... again.</i>
- So let's count down.

468
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:10,220
Let's have some fun,
uh, from five, four...

469
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:13,850
- three, two, one.
- The dead will walk amongst us.

470
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:17,150
No, he shan't,
for he-eth not here.

471
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,900
- I knew it.
- Oh, there's a note.

472
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:23,900
"If I have not yet returned,
I am in the Rapture."

473
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:28,160
Oh, and then it says,
"Love each other."

474
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,200
What does he think
we've been doing?

475
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,410
I loaned him $1,000.

476
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:35,330
<i>Gob didn't fare much better</i>
<i>than the bride,</i>

477
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:37,960
<i>finally being discovered</i>
<i>on an episode</i>

478
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,590
<i>of the auction reality show...</i>

479
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:42,960
Moment of truth, people.

480
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,130
It's a masker.

481
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:48,050
Jesus, there's a man in there.

482
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,640
Let's get the bidding started
at a hundred dollars.

483
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,100
Anybody? -Nope.

484
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,350
He's hissing.

485
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,440
<i>After a week in the hospital,</i>

486
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,610
<i>Gob was happy to finally see</i>
<i>a familiar shape.</i>

487
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:04,820
You humiliated me.

488
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,780
You made a mockery
of my religion

489
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:07,990
and you ruined our wedding.

490
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:11,330
Our first fight,
and like all fights,

491
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,700
you're a little right,
I'm a little right.

492
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,290
I sold your cave on Craigslist.

493
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:17,160
So it was all worth it.

494
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:20,080
We have money to start
our life together.

495
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:24,000
Now we have our nest, egg-- Ann.

496
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:27,470
Now we have our, our nest, Ann.

497
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,470
I'm leaving you, Gob.

498
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:32,220
I don't love you anymore.

499
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:35,270
I feel sorry for you, and
you're gonna be alone forever

500
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:37,850
unless you let the Holy Ghost
inside you.

501
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:40,020
The, the Holy...

502
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:52,160
You know what?
I hope you read this.

503
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,740
<i>And maybe it was</i>
<i>the fact that he had nothing</i>

504
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:58,210
<i>in his system</i>
<i>but two weeks of candy vines,</i>

505
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,620
<i>but it did get through to him.</i>

506
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:01,710
Steve.

507
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,840
It's me. Uh, I-I wanted
to let you know

508
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:08,920
that I am... I'm-I'm ready to...
to... to...

509
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:13,430
let the son of Gob enfold me.

510
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:16,100
Have you been to the club And,

511
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,350
owned by Jeremy "Pivan"?

512
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:19,690
I'm gonna be there tonight
about 8:00.

513
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:21,400
Maybe you could join me,
I don't...

514
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,860
Obviously it's, it's me,
your fa...

515
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:27,780
Nah, he got it.

516
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:30,360
Okay.

517
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,070
<i>Gob was waiting to meet his son</i>

518
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:34,030
<i>at a bar and feeling</i>
<i>a little vulnerable.</i>

519
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,740
Lost my wife, lost my career.

520
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,990
When I was in that storage unit
at the bottom of that rock,

521
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,080
it was like I hit...

522
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,540
- Rock bottom?
- No, no, not that.

523
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,540
More like a trending
downward moment

524
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:46,380
that just-- I don't know.

525
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:49,720
Maybe I'm being tested like
that guy "Jawb" from the Bible.

526
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,300
- : Job.
- Yes?

527
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,300
Job.

528
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,510
Yes, sir.

529
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:55,510
- Job. -Yeah.
- Look, I, I feel sorry

530
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:56,970
- for you, Pops.
- Hey, pal,

531
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:58,850
I'm not that much older
than you, guy.

532
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:00,930
-Nah, I'm just here,
I'm looking for my son.

533
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,730
I'm trying to get some cash
out of him, actually.

534
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:06,150
You, you have another son?

535
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:09,610
I have a brother?

536
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:10,690
Oh, man.

537
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,320
Yes, Steve.

538
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,660
Yeah.

539
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,870
- What's his name?
- Dave.

540
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:18,620
Oh, Dave Holt.

541
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,330
- Yeah, Dave Holt.
- Yes.

542
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:21,910
<i>Yes, Gob</i>
<i>had been speaking to his son</i>

543
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,580
<i>for an hour and a half.</i>

544
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,290
- Wait, your mom's name is Eve?
- Yeah.

545
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:27,670
God, I a chick
named Eve once.

546
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,590
Biggest mistake of my life.

547
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:31,130
<i>And perhaps it was because</i>

548
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:33,130
<i>Gob was inadvertently so warm</i>

549
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:34,930
<i>to his son that Steve</i>

550
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:36,720
<i>- offered him a job.</i>
- I don't even really have a job.

551
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,850
Would you want
to come work with me?

552
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:40,060
I mean, I...

553
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,220
Are you serious?

554
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:43,100
I mean, I'm in pest control, but

555
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,060
father and son.

556
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,770
What a great team.

557
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:47,940
It would be a great team.

558
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,070
I mean, I don't care.

559
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,610
Pest control-- I don't know.

560
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:52,400
As long as I'm not being
a pest to you, right?

561
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,070
- No, never.
- I mean, I'm kidding.

562
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:00,700
Where is your place of business?

563
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,080
- 181...
- 181...

564
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,500
- Manville. -Manville.
- Manville.

565
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,830
Manville.

566
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:08,790
What time do you start
this pest control?

567
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,040
7:00 a.m.

568
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:11,800
Then I'll be there at 6:45

569
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,260
with two cups of coffee.

570
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:16,930
Oh, Dad, this is
the greatest day of my life.

571
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:19,970
No, this is the greatest day
of<i>my</i>life.

572
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:22,350
<i>And perhaps it was because</i>
<i>it</i>was<i>such a great day...</i>

573
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:24,350
- 6:45. -6:45.-<i>... that Gob</i>
<i>decided to stay at the bar...</i>

574
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:26,730
- 6:45.
<i>- ...and show off a little.</i>

575
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:30,480
I bet it's been a long time
since you've seen your...

576
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:33,820
- ...cherry.
- I have lupus.

577
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,700
Could have warned a guy.

578
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,910
<i>But showing off did catch</i>
<i>the attention of someone.</i>

579
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,200
That was the real deal, huh?

580
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,870
How about this?

581
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:43,410
How about you do that cherry
trick for my boy Mark Cherry?

582
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:44,870
Mark Cherry
the baby-faced singer

583
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:46,670
or Marc Cherry
the baby-faced showrunner?

584
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:48,710
Baby-faced singer--
right over there, man.

585
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:51,130
He has loved magic
ever since he was a kid.

586
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:53,920
<i>Which was two years</i>
<i>earlier, when Mark Cherry was</i>

587
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,470
<i>the star of a cable teen sitcom</i>
<i>called</i>

588
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:59,800

00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:01,470
<i>of the TV show</i>Cheers.

590
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:04,020
<i>Soon, Mark Cherry became</i>

JOHN JR:<i>I found a gentleman</i>
<i>who is about</i>

594
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,730
- to do a magic trick for you.
- No, it's an illusion.

595
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,990
A trick is something
a whore does for...

596
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:18,110
Do a trick and I'll pay
for your bar tab.

597
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,740
- Who wants a trick?
- Yeah!

598
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:23,990
<i>Gob had them</i>
<i>in the palm of his hand.</i>

599
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,660
<i>He even got the attention</i>

600
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:28,420
<i>- of a still out-of-control</i>
<i>Rebel Alley...</i>-Do it again.

601
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,120
- I missed it.-<i>... who was</i>
<i>there doing research</i>

602
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:31,710
<i>- for an upcoming PSA...</i>
- Fireball!

603
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,460
<i>...she'd soon be required</i>
<i>to do by law.</i>

604
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,510
Fire, fire!

605
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:38,920
Never yell "fire"
in a crowded place.

606
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,130
It's never funny.

607
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,890
That's always funny.

608
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:43,810
<i>And she was intrigued</i>
<i>by this magical man.</i>

609
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:45,470
- Oh...
- Whoa.

610
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,140
That is a David Spade.

611
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,810
Check your purse.

612
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,860
Nice.

613
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:55,280
Oh, man, paparazzo.

614
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,030
Oh, shoot, great.

615
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:59,030
The last thing I need is to be
seen partying with some tweens.

616
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:01,030
I'm trying to clean up my act.

617
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,870
Dude, network's gonna flip

618
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:04,330
if there's another drunk photo
of you.

619
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:05,580
- I know.
- We got to get you away

620
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,080
- from this place, okay?
- Getting away

621
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,160
is kind of my specialty.

622
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:12,630
I'll have us out of here
in a flash.

623
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:14,420
All right.

624
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,300
Let's get out of here while
they still got lighter fluid

625
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,590
- in their eyes.
- Go, baby.

626
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,640
- Oh, man.
- Oh...

627
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,850
Nice moves, Getaway.

628
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:24,850
Oh.

629
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:26,770
Okay.

630
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:28,730
<i>Gob had been accepted</i>
<i>into the group,</i>

631
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:30,600

<i>business manager's son</i>
<i>Josh Abramson.</i>

633
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,440
<i>Gob actually did</i>

<i>end up driving down Manville</i>

635
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:37,780
<i>- at 6:45 a.m.</i>
- This is it! This is...

636
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,950
I'll be with you in a second,
I'll be right there.

637
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:41,990
Start without me,
just start without me.

638
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:43,820
Don't worry!

639
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:46,330
He's not coming back.

640
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,000
<i>Gob was living the dream,</i>

641
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,130
<i>and felt like he was</i>
<i>in the center of the entourage,</i>

642
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:57,300
<i>even though he was three away</i>
<i>from the center at the closest,</i>

643
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:00,050
<i>and it was pop star</i>
<i>Mark Cherry's dream.</i>

644
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,970
Hey, I'm with, with the guys.

645
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:08,260
Keep the limo running, Getaway.

646
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,640
That's my job.

647
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,560
<i>The next few months</i>
<i>were a blur of partying...</i>

648
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,530
<i>...and shame.</i>

649
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:22,700
<i>But Gob had a trick</i>

650
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:25,620
<i>for helping him forget</i>
<i>the shame.</i>

651
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:29,950
<i>Unfortunately</i>
<i>it also helped him forget</i>

652
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,580
<i>that he tried to forget</i>

653
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,710
- Hey, remember me?<i>-and soon Gob</i>
<i>found himself experiencing...</i>

654
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:37,040

<i>what, on the street,</i>
<i>is referred to...</i>

656
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,010
- ...empty bottle situation.
<i>- ...as a roofie circle...</i>

657
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:42,840
- I won't forget this.
<i>- ...whereby a roofie</i>

658
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,470
<i>is taken the day</i>
<i>after a degrading event...</i>

659
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:51,930
<i>...too late to erase the memory</i>
<i>of the degrading event itself</i>

660
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:54,940
<i>but not too late to erase</i>
<i>the prior day's attempt</i>

<i>to erase the event.</i>

662
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,530
<i>Thus, with no memory</i>

663
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:02,190
Hey, remember me?

664
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,030

Been a while.

666
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,990

669
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,620

<i>Cállate.</i>

671

<i>Days turn into weeks,</i>

691
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,340
