1
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,140
George Michael was
playing a game of lie tag

2
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:14,150
- with his father.
- Wait, I bet we're sitting

3
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,980
in the exact same traffic.

4
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,480
God, I just hope there
are no kids on that plane.

5
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:20,110
500 bucks they find a dead kid...

6
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:22,490
Currently each claimed
to be stuck in traffic

7
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,410
behind a light aircraft
that had landed on the 605.

8
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:27,830
Loving that kid too much and
letting him fly the plane.

9
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,450
And... and you know what? One more thing.

10
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,540
I think I accidentally had
the phone flipped around.

11
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:34,290
I recorded my face the
whole time, you know?

12
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:35,880
Smartphone, stupid man.

13
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,750
Pal, why don't you loop
around and film this thing.

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,210
Someone's got to tell the story.

15
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,460
Michael hung up feeling confident

16
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:42,970
he'd had the last word.

17
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,430
Kidding me?

18
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:47,180
Missed you again, damn.

19
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,180
But, you know, I got out of my car here,

20
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,270
and I'm, uh, standing
here now with a paramedic

21
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:52,520
named Tim Ridge... Ridgley...

22
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,060
Can I record some video over there?

23
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,810
- No cameras allowed.
- No camera...

24
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,610
They're being real tight-assed
about this camera thing.

25
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:59,320
But George Michael was
proving more adept at lying

26
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,780
than anyone suspected.

27
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,280
Getting back in my car now.

28
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,990
You know, thank God we
weren't on that plane.

29
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,450
Which would come in handy with a woman

30
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:09,830
who only knew him as George Maharis.

31
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:12,960
- Hey.
- Hey.

32
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,500
Hey, sorry, that was my dad.

33
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,460
He can be kind of hard to
get off the phone sometimes.

34
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,500
Tell me about it. At least he wasn't drunk

35
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:23,220
and bitching about Don Ameche
not knowing his lines inCocoon.

36
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,840
He... he's actually great.

37
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,180
If anything, I've been
kind of a lousy son lately,

38
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,390
but, you know, it's just...
I mean, at some point,

39
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,180
I've got to start living my life.

40
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,520
No, I know. I mean, my dad is
the nicest guy in the world,

41
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,310
but he just doesn't get it.

42
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:36,810
I have to live my life my way.

43
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:38,520
It's like he's always checking up on me.

44
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,070
- Does yours do that?
- Yeah, no, once in a while.

45
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:41,520
You want to go in here?

46
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:43,820
Yeah, okay.

47
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,990
- Ron.
- Hey.

48
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:49,330
No, no, it's Michael. Michael Bluth...

49
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,660
doing the film about my family and...

50
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,660
Yeah, when are we gonna get
your kid's signature though?

51
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,040
- I'm working on it.
- Oh.

52
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,420
- And I... I got a hold of him.
- Oh, oh.

53
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,830
And we're gonna meet here tonight,

54
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,340
but I think that he's blowing me off.

55
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,380
Well, yeah, kids will be kids, right?

56
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,090
Well, you know, a month ago,

57
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,010
I would've told you that he
and I were exactly the same,

58
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:06,180
that we were twins, you know?

59
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,220
But now, I wouldn't even think of

60
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,970
my son as my brother.

61
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:11,850
Although, in fairness,

62
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:15,890
this is something a Bluth brother would do.

63
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,560
Now the story of a family

64
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,110
whose future was abruptly cancelled

65
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,440
and the one son who had no choice

66
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,740
but to keep himself together.

67
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:31,620
It's George Michael's Arrested Development.

68
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,580
George Michael was a new man.

69
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,460
He had finally cast off the shackles

70
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,170
of his cautious persona,
Come on, man, throw it.

71
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:44,960
And he was ready to play with the big boys.

72
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,220
- Okay, I'm good!
- You all right?

73
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,260
That's it for me.

74
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,340
You guys keep playing.

75
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,350
Oh, too funny.

76
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,890
Oh!

77
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,020
But later, at the student health center,

78
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:59,480
he was reminded of the man
who'd always supported him...

79
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,600
Who would you like us to
call in case of an emergency?

80
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:04,480
And who he'd now twice hurt.

81
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,240
My dad.

82
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,320
And that night, Michael,
trying to impress Rebel

83
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,780
by being a down-to-earth rich guy...

84
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,910
although by doing so, he was neither...

85
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,990
Beverly Hills billionaires
who can't go two minutes

86
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,910
- without putting his phone...
- Got this call.

87
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,500
I got to take this. Hold
on one second. Hello.

88
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,870
Hey, George Michael.

89
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,710
You stuck in traffic, pal?

90
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,880
You know, I just feel terrible
that we couldn't get together

91
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,710
the other night, and,
uh, I miss you, you know.

92
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,420
But I'm free all night if...

93
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:31,470
But Michael hadn't forgiven George Michael.

94
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,430
People in politics involved and I just...

95
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,390
You know, I can't get away this time.

96
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:40,480
It seemed the two men were
growing less alike every day.

97
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,020
And although George Michael felt guilty,

98
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,860
- George Maharis was already
- Oh, God, I've got to get this.

99
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,570
Planning his evening
with, as it turned out,

100
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:52,030
someone who had also just
been put off by his father.

101
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:54,160
Hi, Rebel, it's George Mi... haris.

102
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,870
My night just freed up, and I
was wondering if you wanted...

103
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,830
I thought you were having
dinner with your dad.

104
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:01,580
Well, you know older guys...
the night ends for them at 8:00.

105
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,830
I think I could use a
break from the old guys.

106
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,590
And I've already got
some birth control in me

107
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:06,840
that I paid for myself,

108
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,960
and I'd hate to let it go to waste.

109
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,550
Well, that's perfect,

110
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:13,430
because I'm not quite
ready to have children.

111
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:17,140
So, as he straightened up his room,

112
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,390
he got this call.

113
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,230
- Hey, Dad.
- George Michael, hey.

114
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:21,560
Got out of it.

115
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,940
I just... I made a ton of people angry,

116
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,900
but you know what I always say: family...

117
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,900
Well, aw, gosh, you know, I
really wanted to, uh, do that,

118
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,740
but I just had this work thing come up.

119
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,240
And, uh, it's like you always say:

120
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,410
family first, unless there's a work thing,

121
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,410
and then work first.

122
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,410
I have said that, too.

123
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,910
- Uh, so another time.
- Okay.

124
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,580
But he had another problem
he had to deal with.

125
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,670
- P-Hound.
- Hey, George Michael.

126
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:48,250
- Hey.
- Look, I got us a peace pizza.

127
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,460
Oh, that's great... hey, you've got to go.

128
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,010
What did you do with my stuff?

129
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,760
- I've just got a girl coming over and...
- Maeby?

130
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,550
It's not Maeby, no. But,
um, could you please leave?

131
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,300
Okay, first you "F" me with Fakeblock,

132
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,930
and then you're gonna kick me out

133
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,430
when you have a hottie coming over?

134
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,810
- I have roommate rights.
- Well, you know what?

135
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,850
You voided your rights when you took

136
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,520
this picture of Maeby brushing her teeth.

137
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,440
- Not against the rules.
- Still a little weird,

138
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,610
- don't you think?
- But not against the rules.

139
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:08,650
- Well...
- You know what?

140
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:10,400
This is no longer a peace pizza.

141
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,940
- That is a war pizza.
- Okay, that's fine.

142
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,820
Do you want to take it back or... ?

143
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,200
No, I already ate. Th... that's for you.

144
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,780
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

145
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,580
Enjoy your war pizza!

146
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,040
The pizza hadn't even
cooled before Rebel arrived.

147
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,290
- Hi.
- Hey.

148
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:26,960
Oh, so this is a dorm.

149
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,170
This is a dorm.

150
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:31,340
Well, I suppose anything goes in a dorm.

151
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,300
You got that right.

152
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,720
Although, we should probably go inside,

153
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,100
because they don't like us

154
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,470
hanging out in the hallways, actually.

155
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,680
- Oh.
- Yeah.

156
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:47,650
George Michael had just
officially gotten over Maeby.

157
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:50,190
Thanks for, uh, keeping it down for my R.A.

158
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,900
You were keeping it down, right?

159
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,240
You know what really
impresses me about you?

160
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,110
How little you try to impress me.

161
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:59,160
Well, I aim to not please.

162
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,700
I just came from a dinner
with this right-wing politician

163
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,660
and his date, who was an actual hooker.

164
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:07,080
Oh, my God, they sound
like terrible people.

165
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,920
- Oh, they were.
- Huh.

166
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,210
So, wait, is this where
you conceived Fakeblock?

167
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,340
It was George Michael's first chance

168
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,800
to truly be unpretentious
and undo the big lie.

169
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,840
On the other hand, she thought

170
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,390
he was an unpretentious software genius.

171
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:25,560
If she were to learn that he
was merely a wood block player

172
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,230
with a heightened ability
to track the passage of time,

173
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,770
perhaps she would rightly feel

174
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:32,610
lack of pretention should be a given.

175
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:36,780
It was after second 23 that he said...

176
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,780
24. Yes, it was, uh, right in here.

177
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,410
- Wow.
- Yeah.

178
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,490
This is like making love
with the Wright brothers

179
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,200
in their bicycle shop.

180
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,120
I'm sure she just meant one of them.

181
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,210
Hey, how about her knowing
they had a bicycle shop?

182
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,960
Just a little token...

183
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,380
The next morning, he walked her to her car.

184
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,670
Listen, I got to go shoot a PSA.

185
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,090
I'll text you from the car.

186
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:00,010
Oh, no, don't... don't do...

187
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,550
- Action.
- Tweet and drive.

188
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,930
Yeah, that was good, but it's "text."

189
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,680
And we need the word "don't."

190
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,690
And upon returning to his dorm,

191
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:11,230
he discovered that P-Hound had
officially filed a grievance

192
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,770
with the student housing office.

193
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,150
So P-Hound claims that George Michael...

194
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,240
Make a note of that; that's one person.

195
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,320
Oh, I know, I know.

196
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,900
Messed with his stuff

197
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,870
and stole some software thing?

198
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,870
Yeah, and, uh, George Michael claims

199
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,740
that nobody can live with P-Hound.

200
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,540
Somebody's got to go.

201
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,870
O... okay, it's time for a vote.

202
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,540
We'll each get one vote.

203
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,420
Oh, well, that doesn't really seem fair,

204
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,210
because you guys are obviously
gonna vote for the same person.

205
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,800
Oh, right, yeah, 'cause, uh, we're twins,

206
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,170
and, uh, we have no sense
of ourselves as individuals.

207
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,180
That's right.

208
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,340
Fine.

209
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:43,220
We'll each get a half vote.

210
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,310
And the four men cast their three votes.

211
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:47,140
It's a tie.

212
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,600
Uh, one and a half to one and a half.

213
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,520
The twins were proud to show that they

214
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,020
voted differently from one another.

215
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:56,110
Eh, we're gonna need a tiebreaker, ugly.

216
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:58,280
Fortunately, they were able to bring in

217
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,740
two more half voters...

218
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,860
- It's a tie. Two to two.
- ... who also proved

219
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,620
they were capable of
having opposite opinions.

220
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,330
Double tie!

221
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:06,990
- Yeah! Whoo!
- Yeah! Whoo!

222
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,040
To break the tie, more members of twin club

223
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,330
joined the electorate...

224
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,330
a quadruple tie!

225
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:14,040
Which also jammed up the works.

226
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,460
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Go, yeah.

227
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,130
Maybe we should just bring
in a single person now.

228
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:22,010
Uh, you mean like n... not a twin?

229
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:23,430
Yeah, just to speed things along a little.

230
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,180
And perhaps it was that comment...

231
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,850
I guess one head's better
than two, huh? Twin hater.

232
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:28,560
We've been dealing with
"twincists" like you

233
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,810
all our lives.

234
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:33,690
That united the voting body
into a greater cause than

235
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:35,020
expressing their individuality.

236
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,190
And with the exception

237
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,610
of George Michael's vote...

238
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,070
P-Hound.

239
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:43,450
George Michael. George
Michael. George Michael.

240
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:44,620
George Michael. George Michael.

241
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,990
- ... and one other curiosity...
- George Michael.

242
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:49,290
Bender fromFuturama.

243
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,870
I almost wrote that.

244
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,160
It was a George Michael blitz.

245
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:53,960
George Michael and...

246
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,040
oh, a half vote for "George
Michael the twincist."

247
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,090
See you later, twin hater.

248
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,460
- No, I'm not...
- Uh, uh.

249
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,760
Shh. Go.

250
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,180
And now wishing he'd
actually packed the bag

251
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,640
- I... Shh.
- George Michael aimlessly

252
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,680
headed out onto the campus
where, as fate would have it,

253
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,140
- Oh!
- He ran into his beeping uncle.

254
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,520
What are you doing here?

255
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,270
I was in the neighborhood.

256
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,730
I happened to remember
how much you love bologna.

257
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:19,690
- Huh?
- So, yeah, I just...
I found this great shop-rite

258
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:21,440
and I just thought, you
know who's got to have

259
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:23,610
a taste of this, is young George Michael.

260
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:25,450
He didn't think George
Michael liked bologna.

261
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:27,280
I know how you love bologna.

262
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,080
He was trying to correct
a bad impression he felt

263
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,750
he might have made with his
nephew a few nights earlier.

264
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,830
We're good.

265
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,500
My God, Uncle Gob, what is this?

266
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,710
Can't lie to you, George Michael,

267
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,000
it's a forget-me-now.

268
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,960
I wanted you to forget what happened

269
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,470
at that magic club; I was embarrassed.

270
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:47,260
If you don't want me to tell
anyone about it, I won't.

271
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,430
I'm such a fool.

272
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,600
I go to those things too quickly.

273
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,430
Really, it's just the
age we live in, isn't it?

274
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,940
Take a pill to forget your problems.

275
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,730
Take a pill to go to sleep.

276
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,940
And take a pill to forget your problems.

277
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,520
Need an erection, take a pill.

278
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,190
Need to forget your problems, take a pill.

279
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,400
Take a pill and your
problems are forgotten.

280
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,490
Just take a pill.

281
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:06,610
What an age we live in.

282
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,820
It's great, isn't it?

283
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:10,370
What's with the suitcase?

284
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,370
I got kicked out of my dorm.

285
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:15,160
That was a freebie.

286
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:16,790
You in the market to buy a house?

287
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,290
It's a great time to buy.

288
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:19,710
Oh, I don't want to buy a house.

289
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,130
- I don't have that kind of money.
- Money?

290
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:22,420
Ninja please.

291
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,800
You don't need money.

292
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,170
With that Fakeblock thing you got going

293
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,420
and your great credit rating,

294
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:28,050
we can put you in a Bluth in no time.

295
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,470
Frankly, it wasn't the kind of risk

296
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,310
George Michael would take.

297
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:35,140
But then Gob said something
that changed his mind.

298
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,940
Plus, it would make your dad proud.

299
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,560
I know that he's still
really disappointed about

300
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,940
you, uh...

301
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,230
What, that I blew him off?

302
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,030
Blew him off.

303
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:46,070
Boy, is he disappointed about that.

304
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,320
I would love to say yes...

305
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,280
Yes! There it is!

306
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,450
I got my much vaunted yes!

307
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:51,780
Gob felt good.

308
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:53,580
He would be able to prove

309
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,870
to his brother that he
could actually sell a house.

310
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:59,170
George Michael felt good
because he could prove

311
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:01,540
to his father that he
did indeed support him.

312
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:04,630
And the residents of
Sudden Valley felt good,

313
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:07,340
because it turns out,
the very young-looking man

314
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,220
- who drove down their street
- Hi.

315
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,340
- That afternoon...
- Oh, hello, young man.
- Hi.

316
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,890
How young are you?

317
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,260
I'm good. How you doing?

318
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:15,600
No, how young are you?

319
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,730
Oh, I... I'm 22. 22 years...

320
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,230
- ... was over 21,
- 22? You look 16.

321
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,730
And they wouldn't have to search

322
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,440
for a home that was even more remote.

323
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,400
He's 22! He's 22, but looks 16.

324
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:30,030
Sudden Valley residents

325
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:32,070
wasted no time in welcoming George Michael

326
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,490
- Just wanted to welcome you
- To the community

327
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:35,240
- to the neighborhood.
- Every chance they got.

328
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:37,870
Thank you. Uh... Hi.
Hello again. Welcome back.

329
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,790
Hi. Hi.

330
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:41,580
Oh, it's so nice. Wow.

331
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,040
Like it's my birthday.

332
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:44,800
It's like it's everyone's birthday.

333
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,170
Oh, this is...

334
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:48,670
I wonder who this is from.

335
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,840
- We said no clothes, Carlos.
- Hat is not clothes.

336
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,260
- A hat is clothes.
- Gosh, I wish

337
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,890
I had something to offer you guys.

338
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:55,470
You know, here you are, guests in my home,

339
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,180
and you've gotten me these beautiful gifts.

340
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:00,140
You know, feels like it
should be the other way around.

341
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,980
Football!

342
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,560
Hut, hut.

343
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:05,900
Carlos...

344
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:06,980
Carlos, you're on my team.

345
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,280
You're on my team.

346
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,110
The play is dead. The play is dead.

347
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:12,070
The ball touched the ground.

348
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:13,910
Come on. The play is dead.

349
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,870
Carlos, man, we're on the same team.

350
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:18,240
Guys, maybe... maybe we
can't play skins versus skins.

351
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:19,700
Tops versus bottoms?

352
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,410
I got to bring my girlfriend up here.

353
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,920
- She's gonna love it.
- Let's throw her a party,

354
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,040
Sudden Valley style.

355
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,920
That actually sounds... Yeah, fun.

356
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,050
And so George Michael
was proud to invite Rebel

357
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:36,100
to see how successful
George Maharis had become

358
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,390
and how many people were
eager to be in his company.

359
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:41,310
No, I'm fine, I'm fine. He
was tickling me in there.

360
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:43,690
- Hey, um, what... what is all this?
- Hey. Just a little surprise.

361
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,110
- You did this for me?
- Yes.
- But Rebel had

362
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:47,110
- other concerns.
- We need to talk.

363
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:50,070
Ooh.

364
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,280
This is it.

365
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,950
This is the place.

366
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:55,570
Hope you don't find it too pretentious.

367
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,990
Well, what happened to the
old anything goes in the dorm?

368
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,290
Well, I got this place instead.

369
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:01,870
You know, I guess I wanted to impress you.

370
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,830
I'm gonna get some furniture, obviously.

371
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,750
- Right.
- The guys from home fill are coming this week.

372
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,210
That's not the problem.

373
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,090
No, that's not the problem.

374
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,210
Wrong house, buddy.

375
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,380
No, this is my son,

376
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,840
Lem Depardieu.

377
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,340
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.

378
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,850
Jacqueline still in the car?

379
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:18,350
Oh, you have a son?

380
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:19,970
Yeah.

381
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,770
- Hey, Lem. How you doing?
- Hi.

382
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:23,140
I love kids. I'm great...
You want a Twister?

383
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,270
I was just given, like, four Twisters.

384
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:25,850
- You should take one.
- Wow.

385
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,810
- Go on, take a Twister.
- Oh. You know what, honey?

386
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,610
Do you want to give Mommy some
alone time with her friend?

387
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:33,150
Maybe he could go play in the pool.

388
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,160
- Yeah.
- He'll be totally safe. There's
like 100 guys out there.

389
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,320
- Yay!
- Make sure you wear your sunblock.

390
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,700
In fact, it was the folks

391
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,240
in the pool who were more at risk

392
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,950
of being near Lem than he was of them.

393
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:50,170
And perhaps that's what led Gob

394
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:52,800
to having to take out another ad.

395
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,010
Wow, what a great kid.

396
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:57,430
You know, when I said I was

397
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,050
not eager to have kids,

398
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,180
but I think it's great that you have a son.

399
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,930
You know, I have a spare room here

400
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:04,350
that the two of you could stay in.

401
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,770
Or maybe you could just stay in it.

402
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:07,230
He doesn't live with me.

403
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,230
He lives in France with his father.

404
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:11,860
He just visits March and April
during French pilot season,

405
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,690
but that's what I'm talking about.

406
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,740
I just don't want to get that serious.

407
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,660
Because you're seeing someone else?

408
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,320
No. I mean, yes.

409
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:20,950
I'm seeing someone else, but I don't want

410
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,200
to get serious with him, either,

411
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,790
and you're out telling people

412
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:24,870
in the neighborhood

413
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,210
that we're seeing each other.

414
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,290
What happened to the guy

415
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:28,670
who founded Fakeblock?

416
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,040
The guy who keeps things anonymous?

417
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:31,420
I can do anonymous.

418
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,880
You know, I'm all about staying anonymous.

419
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,800
That's Fakeblock's mission statement.

420
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,130
And then you're asking Lem
and me to move into this house,

421
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,220
and it just, it seems all backwards.

422
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,220
Sorry.

423
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:46,390
Maybe it is backwards.

424
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:49,230
George Michael shared
his relationship problem

425
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:51,560
with the one other woman

426
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:53,480
he'd had a relationship problem with.

427
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,110
Well, she's not really my girlfriend.

428
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:57,200
I mean, I'm crazy about her,

429
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,070
but she wants to keep things anonymous,

430
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:01,030
- and I don't know how to do that.
- Oh, that's ridiculous.

431
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,780
- Right.
- You haven't told her your
real name yet, have you?

432
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:04,200
What? No, no.

433
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,080
No, she still thinks I'm George Maharis,

434
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,790
but she's dating another
guy, which is probably

435
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:11,710
the whole reason she's always
saying I'm moving too fast.

436
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,630
I take things too seriously.

437
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:16,260
I take things too serious.

438
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,630
I take things too seriously.

439
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:18,970
I need to note which
one of those is correct,

440
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:20,840
because I sound like a horse's ass

441
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,760
when I alternate between the two of them.

442
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,390
I need to get my together.

443
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:26,600
- Yeah.
- But the point is that I take things

444
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,100
easily-breezily.

445
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:31,020
Well, a real "serioush" woman

446
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:33,690
knows what she wants and moves quickly.

447
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,900
"Serioush" is nothing. That's not a word.

448
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,360
Are you ready to see your office?

449
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,530
I have been; it's great.

450
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,780
I like it a lot. It...

451
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,740
I wonder if she's gonna think

452
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,240
we've been a little lavish with money.

453
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,530
You know, is it too much?

454
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,580
But then to contradict myself,

455
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,830
I do think at some point,

456
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,660
it would be good to get a second chair

457
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,210
just in case we have a guest,
but I'm thinking big picture.

458
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,420
Of course, that wasn't his office.

459
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,380
This isn't your office.

460
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,130
She's over here.

461
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:58,010
And it was at his actual desk

462
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:00,720
where he made his first
major decision as CEO.

463
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:04,260
Maeby, you're fired!

464
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,560
And although Mort was prepared

465
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,470
to be handed his walking papers,

466
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,520
there was nothing that could
have prepared George Michael

467
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:13,190
for what Mort would leave on his desk.

468
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:15,020
And so, later that day, Hey. Hey.

469
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:17,230
It was a disgruntled Maeby
that ran into Michael-Hey.

470
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,780
As he was seeking a
signature for his movie.

471
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,450
I think movies are dead.
Maybe it's a TV show.

472
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:24,120
What? No. This girl that I'm dating, Rebel,

473
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,490
she's gonna be in it,
and she would never do TV.

474
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:28,580
You're dating Rebel Alley?

475
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,170
Yeah. I have a picture of us
to prove it; I can't find it,

476
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:33,790
- but yeah.
- So...

477
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,130
you're the other guy.

478
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:36,630
You know her personally?

479
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,090
Yes. I mean,

480
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:40,010
that's how I know that you were dating her.

481
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:42,050
Do you know the other
guy that she's dating?

482
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:44,720
And that's when she saw an opportunity

483
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,260
to get back at George Michael.

484
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,270
No, no, but, um,

485
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,560
I know it's over.

486
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,890
She is dumping him.

487
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:52,190
She dumping him?

488
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,940
Apparently, he was coming on too strong,

489
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,560
taking it too seriously.

490
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:56,770
She hates that.

491
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:58,150
- Is that what she said?
- Yeah,

492
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,280
that's what she told me.

493
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,480
Just kills it for her.

494
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:01,860
She wants it easily-breezily.

495
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:05,370
Well, that's... informative.

496
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:07,280
I owe you. Thank you.

497
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:08,490
No, you don't.

498
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:09,910
Okay, wait,

499
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:11,500
wait, wait, wait, wait.
Don't knock, just...

500
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,290
- Okay.
- One second.

501
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:15,170
Mm-hmm.

502
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,750
And so fortified

503
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,920
with Maeby's information that Rebel

504
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,800
- was breaking up with her other beau...
- Hello.

505
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,130
- Michael.
- Michael decided

506
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,260
- to move things along.
- I want you

507
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,680
to know that I think that

508
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,010
I've been coming on a
little bit too strong.

509
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:29,310
I got a lot going on; I got the movie.

510
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,020
You know, a bunch of stuff

511
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,890
with the housing complex, and I'm just...

512
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:34,140
I'm not gonna be pressuring you anymore.

513
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,980
I want to just keep it easy-peasy.

514
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,190
- Yeah.
- Cool, totally.

515
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,730
- Keep it loose.
- Yeah.

516
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:40,440
And we'll have some fun with, you know...

517
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,610
If the fun, you know...

518
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:44,780
Someday, one day, it gets more serious,

519
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,280
you know, then, uh, then it does,

520
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,740
and we, uh,

521
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,330
we're walking down the
aisle, you know, and...

522
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,410
I'm saying it wrong, saying
it wrong, 'cause I get,

523
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,290
uh, I get tongue-tied, um...

524
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:57,670
uh, because I think that you

525
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:00,670
are coming on too strong.

526
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:03,130
- You know? Bugging me.
- Oh, uh,

527
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:04,590
you want to come in?

528
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:07,050
No.

529
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:09,930
- Ooh.
- Yeah? Yeah.

530
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:12,390
It was the best sex Michael had ever had.

531
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,020
That was great.

532
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,060
Was that fun for you?

533
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,190
No.

534
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,190
Are you gonna take a photo of me?

535
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:22,320
Uh, no.

536
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,070
No, no, I've been trying to get a signal.

537
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,950
But he did want a picture of them together,

538
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:29,410
which I why he grabbed the one

539
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:31,120
he saw from the photo booth.

540
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,330
Are you gonna call me?

541
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:33,870
If I'm in traffic.

542
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,870
Although he was growing concerned

543
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:38,380
about how he was going to keep this up.

544
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,840
Hey.

545
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,000
♪ I just stole this fair young miss ♪

546
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,840
♪ From a big shot, George Mahar... ♪

547
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:58,310
Michael had just found out

548
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:00,150
That the woman he loved

549
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:02,730
was also dating his son.

550
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:04,570
So, after placing a call

551
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,400
- to the niece who sent him there...
- Hello?

552
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,700
You're out of the movie.

553
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,990
And at an emotional impasse,

554
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,700
he decided it was time

555
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,290
to deal with Gob

556
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:16,910
and the Sudden Valley problem.

557
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,960
Pervert.

558
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,290
Excuse me?

559
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:24,300
And that's when Michael
ran into a son-Dad, hey.

560
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,630
George Michael, what are you doing here?

561
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,130
Who was eager to make him proud.

562
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:29,800
I... I'm home.

563
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,300
But George Michael had
suddenly found himself

564
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:35,010
- with enormous debt
- You bought this house?

565
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,930
- And tried to hide his panic.
- Why would you buy

566
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,440
one of these pieces of sh...

567
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,310
short-term investments?

568
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,320
Well, you know, Gob told me that you wanted

569
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,320
to start selling these
things, not just renting them,

570
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,530
and I knew it was important to you.

571
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:50,030
He said all that, huh? Oh, boy, that was...

572
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,570
That's... nice of him.

573
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:53,320
How... how could you afford
one of these houses, buddy.

574
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:54,910
Well, I have a lot of money coming in

575
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:56,790
- from investors for my software thing...
- Okay.

576
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:59,250
And I don't know what's gonna
happen with that, so I thought

577
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:01,250
I'd do what everyone around
here says: put it into Bluth.

578
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:03,590
- Yeah, who else is saying that?
- You know, it's an expression.

579
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,380
- Neighbors.
- I don't like it.

580
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,590
- Can I offer you anything?
- No.

581
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:07,670
I just got two more boxes

582
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:09,090
of Twister from the neighbors.

583
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:11,010
- Oh, boy, return them.
- Feel like I have one

584
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:13,430
for every day of the week now.
Anyway, you know, I figure that

585
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,390
worse case scenario is I
sell this place, and I get

586
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:16,890
my money back. It's not like

587
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:18,350
- they're going down in value, right?
- Well...

588
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:19,980
It's a great community.

589
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,600
- Nobody locks their doors around here.
- You should.

590
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,060
Plus, I... I wanted to make it up to you.

591
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,730
You know, I felt terrible

592
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:28,070
about what happened with the dorm and...

593
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,690
- Wow.
- And things between us.

594
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:32,490
And I... I've screwed up a lot of things

595
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:34,370
in the past few weeks,

596
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:36,660
and, you know, this is the one thing

597
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,910
that I know I did right.

598
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:41,460
I mean, who would not want
to raise their kids here?

599
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,380
And perhaps this is why he
didn't give him the bad news

600
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,880
about the neighborhood.

601
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,550
Thank you.

602
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:51,470
Thanks, but you didn't
need to do it for me, pal.

603
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:53,840
Now he just needed to get
out of the house before...

604
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,350
You know, to be totally honest,
I didn't just do it for you.

605
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:58,310
- Yeah?
- I also did it for my girlfriend.

606
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,720
Kind of wanted to impress her.

607
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:02,520
That came up.

608
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,480
Wow.

609
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,650
You got a girlfriend.

610
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:07,520
Good for you. That's great.

611
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:09,280
Congratulations.

612
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,570
Your dad's got one, too.

613
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:11,690
- Oh, yeah?
- Yep.

614
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,240
How is yours going?

615
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,570
Not great.

616
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,780
I haven't been completely honest with her

617
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:21,120
about who I am.

618
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,790
You know, I haven't even
told her my real name,

619
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:25,040
and I don't think

620
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,670
I can keep that lie going, so...

621
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:29,630
I think it might be over.

622
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:31,550
Oh, great...

623
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:36,140
pain fades slowly.

624
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:38,640
Quickly.

625
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,140
- But now it was as simple as getting out...
- Thanks.

626
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,810
- Before George Michael asked...
- But what about you?

627
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:44,480
You're doing great, huh?
Tell me about your girlfriend,

628
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,560
and you're producing this movie now.

629
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,730
That.

630
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:49,320
I think they're both over.

631
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,400
Yeah, it wasn't meant to be.

632
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,530
I'm sorry.

633
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:56,410
And that's when Michael finally
treated his son like an adult.

634
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:58,660
Hey, you know what I miss on you?

635
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,780
The mustache.

636
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:03,410
And so, discouraged, Michael returned

637
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:07,580
to his apartment, only to find worse news.

638
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,710
And when he saw that Lucille 2

639
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,380
was having a campaign event at Cinco,

640
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:15,170
he knew there was only
one thing he could give her

641
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,630
instead of the money.

642
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,510
And he knew what he had to do first

643
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:21,890
to give it to her.

644
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:25,310
George Michael, meanwhile,
had a keynote speech to give,

645
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:28,610
and hadn't totally decided
whether he should come clean.

646
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:30,480
And that's when he ran into his uncle.

647
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,570
We'll take care of.

648
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:33,150
My father's got the money.

649
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,940
- You guys are one heck of a horde.
- Uncle Gob!

650
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:36,650
- No, you're mistaken, friend.
- No, it's George Michael.

651
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,700
- Hi. Exactly.
- Yes.

652
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,490
Hey, I'm actually really
glad I ran into you.

653
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:41,620
I could use some advice.

654
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,240
Oh. Love each other.

655
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:45,160
Oh, no, that's great, but I actually need

656
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,790
a specific piece of advice
for a certain situation.

657
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,670
I'll give it to you fast.

658
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:53,630
Basically, for the past few
weeks, I've been living a lie.

659
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:56,010
I've been... in this
relationship with a woman

660
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:57,880
who doesn't even know.

661
00:22:57,930 --> 00:22:59,800
It's probably over with the girl.

662
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:06,640
... gone way too far...

663
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,140
So, basically now I can either tell her...

664
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,360
that there is no George Maharis

665
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,440
and never was... or...

666
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,150
we keep things anonymous

667
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:18,990
and I continue the lie
that Fakeblock exists.

668
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:22,160
From my perspective...

669
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,700
something about "there's a girl... "

670
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,750
Did you... Does she like you?

671
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:27,410
I mean, you're not the
world's most handsome guy.

672
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,710
Yeah, no, she likes...

673
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:29,960
I would say what I did take away was that

674
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,170
I would rather have sex with someone

675
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,090
because they thought I was someone else

676
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:37,720
than not have sex with someone
because they thought I was me.

677
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,090
So I should probably do
the opposite of that and...

678
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:45,600
be true to who I am and
not compromise my integrity

679
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,520
just for some fleeting sexual experience.

680
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:51,690
- So, "love each other."
- There it is.

681
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,150
It wasn't much help,

682
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:55,530
and as George Michael headed off

683
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:59,070
unsure of what to do, Gob
went off to find his father,

684
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:01,530
who was having his own relationship crisis.

685
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:03,160
We're getting a real divorce.

686
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,780
You're out of the marriage.

687
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,870
So I am fat.

688
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:10,500
Boy, am I glad you're here.

689
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,080
I need money and it's
not for what you think...

690
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,000
for a magic show or a bee colony...

691
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,710
it's to pay the builders I hired
to start building the fake wall

692
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:17,960
between Mexico and America.

693
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:19,420
Shh! Are you crazy?

694
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:20,840
Lucille 2 is around here.

695
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,590
Well, don't worry about Lucille 2.

696
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,050
I'll handle her.

697
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:25,970
It's just that I need to pay the Chinese.

698
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:29,100
Wait, wait, you... you hired Chinese?!

699
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:31,810
Well, I figured who better than
the Chinese to build a wall.

700
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,770
But, no, I couldn't afford them,

701
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:37,820
so I... I hired, um, they're
technically Mongols, I guess.

702
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:40,280
They're, well, they're the
people that they built the wall

703
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,490
to try to keep out...

704
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:42,700
How many did you hire?

705
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,320
A horde. That's the minimum.

706
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:46,330
They don't come in
anything less than a horde.

707
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:48,950
So you hired a Mongol horde.

708
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:52,330
Look, Dad, just, if they
don't get their money soon,

709
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:54,540
they're gonna be really mad
and then they're gonna have

710
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,960
a major Mongolian beef
with us... there they are.

711
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,210
Okay, uh, we don't have any m... money.

712
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:03,970
Well, he says that we don't have any money.

713
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:11,770
And at that moment, another
Bluth who had no money

714
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:14,440
was finding a way to pay up.

715
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,610
What are you doing?

716
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:16,770
I'm gonna have sex with you.

717
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:17,770
For money.

718
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,440
Oh!

719
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,280
- Oh, I didn't realize
- Yeah.

720
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,240
How heavy these rings are.

721
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,160
- Yeah.
- But I thought you were gonna kiss me

722
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,370
and I panicked.

723
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,910
I... I was gonna kiss you.

724
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:33,250
I didn't even try to do it that time.

725
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:35,710
So, it's, uh, let's take a tumble

726
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,590
with Old Moneybags, right?

727
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:42,010
And she'll be so grateful that
she'll walk away from $700,000.

728
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:43,420
No, no, no, it would
absolutely not be a gift.

729
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:45,050
This would still be a loan, okay?

730
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:48,050
However, my lovemaking
would be, you know...

731
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,560
What?

732
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,890
What, Michael? What were you gonna say?

733
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:55,270
Something that I would never
be able to take back, but...

734
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,860
I didn't want that to happen.

735
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:58,980
Now, listen, you have been the one

736
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,320
that has been flirting with me.

737
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,440
- Those were pity flirts.
- No, they were not.

738
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:04,610
You want this as much as I do.

739
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:06,240
As much as I want this extension.

740
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,780
Two different "this" es.

741
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:11,030
Now, you own a company
that I helped to build.

742
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,750
It was all of my hard work.

743
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:15,000
This is something you have
to do because, if you don't,

744
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,710
I can't be held responsible
for what I might do.

745
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,880
As it turns out,

746
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,760
George Michael was the only Bluth

747
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,470
who could be responsible for what he did,

748
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:27,640
and as he headed to the microphone,

749
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,890
Mongols, not paid what they were promised,

750
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:32,100
did what they do best.

751
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,730
Um... Oh! Ah!

752
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:36,190
Viva Méjico.

753
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,690
Which lead to this.

754
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:40,150
Put up this wall!

755
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:42,530
And it's hard to know
whether it was the chanting

756
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:44,030
- of "Put up this wall... "
- Ladies and gentlemen,

757
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:46,320
if I could have your
attention for a moment...

758
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,820
or the note that promised
him a sexual resumption

759
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:51,910
of his anonymous relationship with Rebel...

760
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,450
that made him say this:

761
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:57,670
Yeah, so, I'm George Maharis, and, uh...

762
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:00,670
and Fakeblock is real...

763
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,590
- Let's put up this wall.
- Put up this wall!

764
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:08,260
But not everyone wants to
put up a wall on the Internet.

765
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,140
Let's put up, put up this
wall. Have a good night.

766
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:15,310
And the Anonymous who
left the note wasn't Rebel.

767
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:21,810
A discouraged Michael
returned to the model home,

768
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:26,190
where he ran into a brother
who also had something to hide.

769
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,110
As an emboldened George
Maharis gave Rebel a note

770
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:32,780
that she now believed he'd written for her.

771
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:36,000
And for the son, it
was a night to remember,

772
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,920
and for the father, a night to forget.

773
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,210
- * So easy to forget. *
- Shh.

774
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:44,500
It was May 5, Rebel, it's Michael.

775
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:46,800
And while Rebel was on the phone,

776
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,170
George Michael was realizing
that taking things casually

777
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:51,260
was not going to be an option for him.

778
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,050
You can come over later, okay?

779
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:54,470
- Good-bye.
- I'll see you soon.

780
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:56,270
Who was that?

781
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,930
No one.

782
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,810
Look, I... I don't care.

783
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:03,610
I... I don't care that
you're seeing someone else.

784
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:06,650
I... I just, I want to continue this.

785
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:08,780
I'm ready to try and make this work.

786
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:11,360
I'll fight anyone I have to for you.

787
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:13,740
I'm not going to pretend
I don't care about you.

788
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,740
I'm a grown-up man and...

789
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:18,000
I want to get serious.

790
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:22,210
Wow. Serious.

791
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:23,880
Things are getting serious.

792
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,920
And the girl who was never capable

793
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,300
of making a commitment...

794
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,840
Okay.

795
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,590
Suddenly found herself making too many.

796
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:33,220
Okay.

797
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,550
Okay.

798
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:42,060
George Michael felt good.

799
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:46,070
And, at least for that day,

800
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:49,820
he wouldn't encounter his
father in Rebel's bedroom...

801
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:52,110
He'd run into him leaving the building.

802
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,450
Hey.

803
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:54,490
What are you doing here?

804
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:55,910
I'm vi... I'm on a visit.

805
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:57,160
I'm visiting.

806
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,080
My girlfriend lives here... Rebel.

807
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,670
Wow. So you're gonna work
it out with your girlfriend.

808
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:04,290
Good for you. That's great news.

809
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:06,420
- Great to see you again.
- That says "Rebel," huh?

810
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:10,300
Is that a... is that
a little gift for Rebel?

811
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:18,180
I'm dating Rebel Alley.

812
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:22,690
So there better be two
Rebels in here, am I right?

813
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:23,810
I'm dating Rebel Alley.

814
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:26,020
That'd be weird.

815
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,980
No, ironically, she did say

816
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,030
that there was another guy,

817
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:30,230
but that his name was George...

818
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,900
- ... Maharis.
- Maharis. That's me.

819
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,530
You're George Michael.

820
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:37,320
No, but, uh, yeah, but I
use the name George Maharis

821
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:40,410
when... with women, because
I hate the name George Michael.

822
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:41,370
I told you that.

823
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:43,330
This is, uh, this is weird.

824
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:44,870
Are you not kidding me?

825
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,250
It's insane... no...
so, you're the other guy.

826
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:49,210
I'm the oth... well, you're the other guy.

827
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:50,590
Yeah, well, one of us.

828
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:53,510
Did I not tell you that we were alike?

829
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:55,090
Exactly alike.

830
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:57,470
- This is just...
- So horrifying.

831
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:58,800
Too funny.

832
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:00,010
This is what I was talking about.

833
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,020
I told you.

834
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,470
I mean, we're like twins.

835
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,680
Are we not like twins?

836
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:05,270
All the way down to the photo booth.

837
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,900
You name me one way in
which we're different.

838
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:09,820
Well, Dad, you know, I
never, in a million years,

839
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,610
would have gone out
with her, if I knew that

840
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:13,030
you were, you know, the other guy.

841
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:15,360
Me, neither.

842
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,740
I wouldn't have, either.

843
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,660
Damn it. You know?

844
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,780
You gotta believe me.

845
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:21,200
This is just...

846
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,910
- This is, uh...
- Yeah...

847
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,210
How'd you know about the photo booth?

848
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:38,010
How... you... 'cause you said,
"Right down to the photo... "

849
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:40,470
I said, "Right down to the photo booth."

850
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:48,600
Ironically, he could've
told the truth and said

851
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:50,310
he'd taken a forget-me-now.

852
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,520
But like the victim of a roofie circle,

853
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:55,860
having taken one was the
only memory he had lost.

854
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,860
So, instead, he doubled-down on this.

855
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:00,820
It's like we're identical twi...

856
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,970
Gob gets an important call

857
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:01,050
- from his mother.
- Hello. She's gone.

858
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:04,810
Lucille 2 has disappeared and
it's time for you to step up

859
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:07,060
and be president of the Bluth Company.

860
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,600
Keep your nose clean. No scandals!

861
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,520
Okay.

862
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,860
And even though Gob hadn't
taken a forget-me-now

863
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,730
the night before...

864
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:16,070
it seems Tony Wonder had.

865
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:19,900
Hey, Gobie. It's Tony.

866
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:22,740
We still on for our sex date tonight?

867
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:36,920
And this happens...

868
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,010
Oh! Okay.

869
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:39,840
Are you Buster Bluth?

870
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,130
I am.

871
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,130
- Okay, this...
- Can we come in?

872
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,550
This isn't my house.

873
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,760
- What is this regarding?
- That's all right.

874
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:49,770
You're under arrest for the
murder of Lucille Austero.

875
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:51,310
Read him his rights.

876
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:53,060
Okay, I think there's
been some kind of mistake.

877
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,110
That left hand might be difficult to cuff.

878
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:57,400
- Trouble cuffing him.
- I'm not a monster!

879
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,900
I got it.

880
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,900
Uh... all right, great.

881
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:06,450
Well, the infamous Bluth
family is at it again,

882
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:08,990
this time facing murder charges,

883
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:12,000
and our Imagine cameras
were there to capture it all.

884
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,290
Hey, did you see this?

885
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:14,790
Yeah, I saw it just now in the elevator.

886
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,130
Is this the family
you've been talking about?

887
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:17,170
It sure is.

888
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:18,630
Wow! You got the rights to this?

889
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:20,010
Well, only for the
killer... but that's enough

890
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:21,340
for us to get a green light, right?

891
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,180
Absolutely! It's our next Da Vinci Code!

892
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:26,100
Yay! That's great!

893
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:28,810
Plus, it's gonna put
Imagine News on the map.

894
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:31,890
- This is John Beard.
- Love each other.

895
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:59,890
