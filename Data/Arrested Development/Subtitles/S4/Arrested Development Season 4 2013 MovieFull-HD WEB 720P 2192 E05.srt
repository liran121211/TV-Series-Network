1
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,570
Keep your eyes open.

2
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,030
All right, guys, what do we got?

3
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,370
It's quiet out there.

4
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,910
Stand by.

5
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,000
Yeah, we, uh,
we better be ready.

6
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,460
Yeah, I'm a man.

7
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,750
Don't make it look like makeup.

8
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,550
Car.

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,180
Car.

10
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,970
Is that guy one of ours?

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,760
Look at the license plate.

12
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:43,640
Looks like we got ourselves
an anus tart.

13
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,400
Tobias Funke
was on his way to reconnect

14
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,310
with a daughter
he'd lost touch with.

15
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,320
Hey, there.

16
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,940
It's Big Daddy.

17
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:55,070
I thought I'd try to call you
before I surprised you.

18
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:58,360
Things are...
really looking up, and...

19
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,780
Hello? Oh, damn it.

20
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:02,870
What Sudden Valley does
to these cell phones.

21
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,000
Oops.

22
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,830
Unbeknownst to Tobias, however,

23
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:08,620
the Sudden Valley home
he was on his way to visit...

24
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,540
Anus tart is turning
on Tracey Lane.

25
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,000
...had been rented out
to a television crew.

26
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:14,090
He's creeping up George Michael.

27
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:15,510
All right, guys, let's entrap

28
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:16,920
a local predator.

29
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:18,340
Come on. Lowlife.

30
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,430
We got to put
this piece of (bleep)...

31
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:21,870
Who, what, when,
where, why and how.

32
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:23,220
Who, what, where, when,
why and how.

33
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,890
Who, what, when,
where, why and how.

34
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,560
Anus tart is
approaching the portico.

35
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,360
Yes, Tobias was
finally about to get

36
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,360
a starring role
on a hit TV show.

37
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,740
Is there a little girl here
all by herself?

38
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,740
And now the story
of the awful people

39
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,160
who are about to lose
everything, and the one newsman

40
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,700
who had no choice but to
entrap them all together.

41
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:49,710
It's John Beard's To Entrap
a Local Predator, "Supercreeps."

42
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,790
Now the story of a family

43
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:55,050
whose future
was abruptly cancelled,

44
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,010
and the one son-in-law
who had no choice

45
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,550
but to keep himself together.

46
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,930
It's Tobias's
Arrested Development.

47
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:13,020
Five years before Tobias was to
appear on John Beard's TV show,

48
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,360
his acting career
was as washed up...

49
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,360
- None taken.
- ...as his family...

50
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,070
You are soaked to the bone.

51
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,570
...and those men he was
touching for some reason.

52
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,450
And his wife challenged him

53
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:26,040
to reexamine the other parts
of his life as well.

54
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,750
There's nothing
keeping us together.

55
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:30,710
It's time to give up our dreams
if they're not working.

56
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,500
You know, your acting career,

57
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,130
this marriage
that everyone thinks is a sham

58
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,250
because you're gay.

59
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,920
I-I'm sorry.

60
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,130
Everyone thinks I'm gay?

61
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:45,560
Well, I mean, it's kind of
a running joke in the family.

62
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,390
I mean, y-you know that, right?

63
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,680
'Cause of the misleading way
you talk sometimes.

64
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:53,980
Oh, you're saying the way I talk
makes me sound gay?

65
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,270
When in the last year

66
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,860
have I said anything
remotely mis...

67
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,610
♪ It's just a fallacy! ♪

68
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:03,490
...leading? Is this because
I want to be an actor,

69
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,200
and all the leading men
in Hollywood are gay?

70
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,030
I don't think
that all the leading men

71
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,120
in Hollywood are gay.

72
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,660
Oh, honey.

73
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,370
Look, we're chasing things
that aren't real.

74
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,130
Maybe we need to go out there
and find out

75
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,710
what we're meant to do.

76
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,210
His wife was giving him
the cold shoulder.

77
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,840
And after kissing it good-bye,

78
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,760
he sat with her family,
feeling lost...

79
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,640
Well, you look like I feel.

80
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,560
...and very misunderstood.

81
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,980
Gay?

82
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,060
No, I...

83
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,480
No.

84
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,110
Tobias knew
it was time to find out

85
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,350
what he was truly meant to do.

86
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,440
So when he came across a book

87
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,700
the universe
had placed in his path,

88
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,030
he was open to its inspiration.

89
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,160
Oh, they're still reading,
but...

90
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,410
well, I guess I can
leave them some love.

91
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,450
So he just took
"eat" and "pray."

92
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,040
"Eat" was easy,

93
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,420
although it provided
no cosmic answers for him.

94
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:01,630
But it was the part about India
that really got to him.

95
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:04,130
And so, like the heroine
of Eat, Pray,

96
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,050
- Tobias decided
- Wait a minute.

97
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:09,180
to get as far away
from his wife as possible.

98
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:15,810
And so Tobias found himself
booking passage to India.

99
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:18,610
And soon, he discovered
his wife was also

100
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:20,570
preparing to go somewhere...

101
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,530
- I think you have my suitcase.
- ...far away.

102
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,530
I'm so sorry, Tobias.

103
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:25,860
Look, I've already packed.

104
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,860
Can I just use this one?

105
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,700
Oh, what the heck.

106
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,990
I guess having matching luggage
isn't so romantic anymore.

107
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,660
And these romantic gestures are

108
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,330
possibly why people think
I'm a homosexual.

109
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:40,130
Well, it's time to correct
old misconceptions.

110
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:42,550
And that is why
I'm making a new start.

111
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,970
Oh, a new start.

112
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:47,510
Filled with compassion and love.

113
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,890
I like that.

114
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,300
Well, I've already got
the license plate,

115
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,430
so go cry in your pie!

116
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,640
And so Tobias, hoping to

117
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,770
"straighten out" his image,
set out on a new start,

118
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:01,110
beginning with a trip
to the airport in an outfit

119
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,400
he pretty much put together
himself.

120
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,110
Well, I guess this is why

121
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,570
you never see them
driving convertibles.

122
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,070
I'll have to check on that one.

123
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,160
But it certainly
wasn't embraced...

124
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,530
Stay in your lane, anus tart!

125
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,910
(bleep) anus tart!

126
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,330
...by the local
Indian community.

127
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:15,750
You have the true sense
of the oneness of all.

128
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,370
And his quest
hit a bump early on,

129
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,630
as he struggled to learn
the customs and gestures of

130
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:23,630
- the culture he hoped to adopt.
- Oh, goddamn it!

131
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,720
Am I the only one
who still dresses to fly?

132
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,970
Well, there we go.

133
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,340
India clean.

134
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,390
Now, how did I...

135
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,680
No. No.

136
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,020
Unfortunately,
recreating the look

137
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,850
- of the traditional Indian garb
- Are you finished? Oh.

138
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:40,520
turned out to be more
difficult...

139
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,440
I look like one of those
hot guys from Spartacus.

140
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,650
...without the aid of Pradeep,
the helpful Indian salesman...

141
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:47,860
I feel like there was
less up top.

142
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,820
...at Bed, Bath & Beyond, who
helped him learn how to tie it.

143
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,320
Ah, got it, okay.

144
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,200
Yes, I actually
like this better.

145
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,710
Yes?

146
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,500
Canadian?

147
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,170
No, I'm American.

148
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:06,300
Oh, yeah. I'm Canadian.

149
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,670
Oh. Sorry.

150
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,590
But because it was
a long flight,

151
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:12,300
he figured he'd wait a beat
on finding his true calling

152
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,260
and watch something to
take his mind off Lindsay...

153
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,680
How could they not have
Failure to Launch?

154
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,810
...who he knew was far away
at the time.

155
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,310
Goddamn it.

156
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,980
And after taking

157
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,570
the wrong bag at the airport...

158
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,190
Do not leave
any goats unattended.

159
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:29,610
All unattended goats
will be confiscated.

160
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,990
...Tobias finally arrived...

161
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:34,620
And so Tobias Funke
embarked on a--

162
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:38,330
Oh, dear, Lord, it's... hot!

163
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,250
...in India, yes, where he was
very uncomfortable.

164
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:43,540
Not only because
the wind whipped up

165
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,750
his queen-sized
fitted mini-sarong,

166
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,590
but because he looked
the wrong direction

167
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,830
when stepping into the street.

168
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:53,140
And so Tobias experienced India

169
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,140
from the inside
of a hospital room,

170
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,640
where the staff
was being trained...

171
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,600
This man here broke his skull
in two places.

172
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,890
...by the same doctor
he'd had in America.

173
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:03,060
Once outside the airport
and once in the elevator

174
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,860
when his sheet got caught and
he was pulled off his gurney.

175
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,020
Literally.

176
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,350
Two places indeed.

177
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,940
This is very funny.

178
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,740
It's like that new show
we just caught, Laugh-In.

179
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,070
My name is...

180
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,700
Oh!

181
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:18,040
Now I've broken my skull
in a third place!

182
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,710
On this elephant guy statue!

183
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,420
Tobias had wanted the universe
to provide him a sign.

184
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,170
You should be a comedy actor.

185
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,340
And finally it had.

186
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,380
This is the sign I've been...

187
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,590
Looking for.

188
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,510
And after two more weeks
in the hospital,

189
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,720
it was time
for his flight home.

190
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,640
And that's when he got
another sign.

191
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,180
A call from Lindsay.

192
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,980
Although he wouldn't be able
to reach the phone for hours...

193
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,690
I'm ready to make this work.

194
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:48,020
...due to his already
weakened spine.

195
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,240
Tobias and Lindsay

196
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,110
shared the news
of their new start

197
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,530
at a family gathering.

198
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,200
I got the part.

199
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,410
You know, it's funny,
for I, too, find that

200
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:01,830
I am on a journey.

201
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,160
Although, as we discovered

202
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:05,080
when our MasterCard bill
came back,

203
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,670
it was the same one she took.

204
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,500
But mine has confirmed
that I should

205
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,920
redouble my efforts to achieve

206
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,880
the unachievable dream
of being an actor.

207
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:17,720
A journey
that has left me eager

208
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,390
to connect with my true love.

209
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,640
Particularly if she finds her...

210
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,400
way clear to covering
a 2, 000-rupee

211
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,570
City of Hopelessness
hospital debt.

212
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,730
The trick is going to be
getting anyone to believe

213
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,030
that her husband
is straight enough

214
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,950
to have a true love
that's a woman.

215
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,700
What are you implying?

216
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,740
Oh, I don't think there was
any implying going on at all.

217
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,950
Didn't hear any implying.

218
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,160
I wasn't implying.

219
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,540
I'm sorry, Mother.

220
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,120
It's just, I've got
a bit of a stick

221
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,620
up my "bunghole"
about what I've now found

222
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,080
is a running joke about me.

223
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,920
But let's be honest.

224
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,550
For 2, 000 rupees, we'd both
go down on Matthew McConaughey.

225
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,420
Yes, Michael?

226
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,470
At the time of this
family meeting,

227
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,680
2, 000 rupees was $36.

228
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,640
I wouldn't.

229
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,720
Of course you wouldn't, Michael.

230
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,720
You never accept help
from anyone.

231
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:06,020
And hoping to do things
differently this time,

232
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,900
Lindsay immediately started
spending money she didn't have.

233
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,520
Are you ready to make a move?

234
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,150
As you can see,
I'm ready for a lot that's new.

235
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,650
Oh, good heavens.

236
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,660
While Tobias pursued

237
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,660
the life of
a professional actor.

238
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,700
Listen, I'm an actor,
you're an agent.

239
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,830
You do the math.

240
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,330
I want you to represent me.

241
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:27,540
In other words,
you do the math--

242
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,960
the money, the negotiating.

243
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,040
You know I'm not
that kind of agent, right?

244
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,670
I'm a real estate agent.

245
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:35,420
I'm a predator; I sell
giant houses to very poor people

246
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,170
who can't afford them
with predatory loans.

247
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,130
No, see, that's the money stuff
I don't understand.

248
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,050
All you need to do
is tell people

249
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:43,140
what a terrific actor I am,
'cause I can't do it believably.

250
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,520
What do you say?

251
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,270
Sounds like it shouldn't be
too much work.

252
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:47,430
Huzzah!

253
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,690
Okay, here's the number

254
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,730
of my current agent
Mike Matthews.

255
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:53,820
He's at Allstate. Fire him.

256
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,820
Tobias started seeing positive
career signs everywhere...

257
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,240
...decorating my quarters.

258
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,700
...he chose to put them.

259
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,540
And at his new agent's
suggestion...

260
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,450
Hi. I'm after pending.

261
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,080
...he even snuck on to a studio
lot to hand out head shots

262
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,330
to extras and other
show business insiders.

263
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,000
Taft-Hartley pending.

264
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,750
Things were
looking up for the Funkes.

265
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,130
They even celebrated
their first

266
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:20,380
- home-cooked Thanksgiving.
- Including duck l'orange.

267
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:21,680
Oh!

268
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,600
Oh, no!

269
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,930
Lindsay!
Lindsay, get the scooper!

270
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:27,310
Throw oranges at it.

271
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,270
Hot orange! Hot orange.

272
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,560
All right...

273
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,190
It's throwing its voice!

274
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,770
- Oh!
- Lindsay!

275
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,030
And so they went

276
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,780
to the Fountain Valley
China Garden instead.

277
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,990
And if the collapse
of the housing market,

278
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:45,450
- his lack of auditions...
- Tobias Funke.

279
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,410
or even the writers' strike

280
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,500
couldn't deter Tobias
from his dream,

281
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,460
the suicide of his ruined

282
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,460
and despondent agent
certainly could.

283
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,760
I believe he died as a warning,
in a way, his message perhaps

284
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,800
to live within our means

285
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,630
and be realistic
about our lives.

286
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,220
And yet it didn't.

287
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,680
Well, then I shall
redouble my efforts

288
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,560
so that he died in vain.

289
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,650
Meaning he will have led
a pointless life,

290
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:14,770
is what I mean.

291
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:16,070
Yes, carry on. Thank you.

292
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,480
And he soon found himself

293
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,900
bringing his wife
to an acting class

294
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:23,530
in an effort to jump-start
his career and marriage.

295
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:25,410
If everyone's good,
you'll get your juice.

296
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:27,950
What did you say the name
of this acting class was again?

297
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,450
Method One Clinic.

298
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,010
Okay, I'm gonna go get coffee.

299
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,170
Garden Grove Method One Clinic.

300
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,040
And Tobias found himself
captivated

301
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,710
by one of the monologues.

302
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,420
And I made it in that movie,
the Fantastic Four,

303
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:43,300
uh, but it wasn't fantastic
for me.

304
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,260
Uh, I got carried away.

305
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,850
And I'm like,
"This (bleep) is (bleep) up,

306
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:50,310
"and I've got to get
my (bleep) together

307
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,430
or I'm gonna be (bleep), too."

308
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,940
Anyways, now I'm sober,
and I'm trying.

309
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,810
It's... super hard.

310
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,860
Thank you. Thank you.

311
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,150
It was a devastating
and personal story.

312
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,860
Okay, notes:

313
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,030
um, first of all, it seemed
you were slurring a bit there,

314
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:08,530
and I just think
you'd have so much more fun

315
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,040
punching those... those words.

316
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,450
Get it out there.

317
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,160
"This (bleep)
is (bleep) up, sir."

318
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:16,170
I'm-I'm sorry. I'm not familiar
with the piece, so...

319
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,090
No, no, that's it.

320
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:21,840
But I am familiar with your work
in the Fantastic Four, however.

321
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,760
- You've seen that?
- Of course I have.

322
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,880
20 years earlier,
DeBrie Bardeaux

323
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:28,100
had played Sue Storm
in the low-budget version

324
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:31,140
of the Fantastic Four, produced
by Imagine Entertainment,

325
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,140
when, during Imagine's
Christmas party,

326
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:36,100
a drunk lawyer reminded them
they'd lose the rights

327
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:39,360
if they didn't make the film
in the next six days.

328
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:44,030
After a two-hour search,
they found their entire cast.

329
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:47,160
They also proved useful six
days later at the wrap party.

330
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,200
I almost never get recognized
as the Invisible Girl.

331
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,870
I can't believe you saw me.

332
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,660
Well, I-I thought it was
"fantastic."

333
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,750
Actually, most
of the performance

334
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,330
that had so captivated
Tobias...

335
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,130
Hey, maybe she came into
this Light Bulbs Unlimited.

336
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,800
She was here a minute ago.

337
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,880
...was performed
by a fishing line.

338
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,130
This is the gayest
Starbucks ever!

339
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,180
Did his fishing line break, too?

340
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,640
Well, my acting career is over.

341
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,930
Oh, don't say that. You've got
to say, "Keep the dream alive."

342
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:15,350
That's what helps me.

343
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,230
Well, this is what's helping me.

344
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,350
- Oh.
- It's really good.

345
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,400
Carl Weathers used to give us
grape juice.

346
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,860
But then he'd add five dollars
to our credit card.

347
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,240
Well, here is to
our acting addiction.

348
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,240
Yep.

349
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,280
May we never be cured.

350
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,580
Are you crying? Oh, I'm crying.

351
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,290
Oh, it's a nosebleed.

352
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:38,080
Oh, thank you so much.

353
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,210
Tobias had found a friend.

354
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,750
- You're neat!
- You're neat.

355
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,170
You're neat.

356
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:44,670
You're neat.

357
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:49,340
And after a
not-very-cute meet-cute,

358
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,890
Tobias continued to find
DeBrie's behavior delightful,

359
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:53,890
even when the methadone
made her think

360
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:56,890
she was a piece of toast.

361
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,890
There, now I can see

362
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:01,860
a pretty face under all that
butter substitute.

363
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,940
And I recognize you
from somewhere,

364
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:07,650
but it's not the Fantastic Four;
it's from somewhere else.

365
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:10,110
I've done some things
I'm not proud of.

366
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,700
Episodics? Been there.

367
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,660
It wasn't episodic.

368
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,200
She had been in a series

369
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,660
of soft-core porn movies
about women

370
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,500
leading straight men
into gay sex,

371
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,750
- called Straight Bait.
- This is my brother. He's gay.

372
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,330
If you want to have sex with me,

373
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,380
then you've got to have sex
with him first.

374
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:28,760
And if you don't want to have
sex with her, you must be gay.

375
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,970
I'll show you how not gay I am.

376
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,930
She did six of these movies,

377
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:38,890
and after lunch,
did three more.

378
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:40,640
It's nice to be
recognized though.

379
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,440
Marky Bark--
sometimes he doesn't know

380
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,520
when I'm in the same room.

381
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,900
And sometimes it feels like

382
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,460
it's not the face blindness,
you know?

383
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,440
It's the same
with me and Lindsay.

384
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:51,820
I know she's trying,
but she doesn't believe

385
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,820
in my acting career.

386
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:56,580
Maybe she's right. I've yet
to make more money as an actor

387
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,620
than I ever did as a doctor.

388
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,460
And that's with
Country-Wide behind me.

389
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,670
You're... wait, you're a doctor?
You can write scripts?

390
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,630
Well, I like to think so.

391
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:08,010
You should never give up a dream
if you can write scripts.

392
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:11,010
You seem like you'd be
a good doctor/actor.

393
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:13,340
It was the first
positive reinforcement

394
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,470
Tobias had had since India.

395
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:19,100
You remind me of
Billy Crystal... Mmm, mmm!

396
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:21,810
It would have broken
Tobias's heart if he knew

397
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:23,980
she was about to say
"Billy Crystal Meth,"

398
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,440
a funny drug dealer.

399
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,980
Uh, I... got a bit carried away

400
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:31,280
when you compared me
to Billy Crystal.

401
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,820
You remind me
of Billy Crystal...

402
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:37,410
Once again, she was going
to say "Billy Crystal Meth."

403
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:40,160
I'm sorry, but, DeBrie,
I-I've never met anyone

404
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,040
who understands me like you do.

405
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,250
- Or at all.
- Maybe, with someone like you,

406
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:45,920
I could have a new start.

407
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,380
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

408
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:53,090
Did you see my license plate--
"A-N-U-S-T-A-R-T"?

409
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:55,680
Whoa. Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

410
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,430
Did you see my Straight Bait
movie of the same name?

411
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:01,810
Coincidence.

412
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:03,350
We should be together.

413
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,770
We should run away.

414
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,480
Oh, my gosh.

415
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,150
Well, this is happening so fast.

416
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:10,730
Well, what do I do
about Lindsay?

417
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:13,530
I mean, can I just improv my way
out of a marriage?

418
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:18,120
Yes, and... let's do this.

419
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,200
Blackout.

420
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,870
Unaware that a similar

421
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:23,410
off-menu swap had just occurred
at Swappigans,

422
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,000
Tobias broke the news

423
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,380
that he was leaving Lindsay
in a phone call.

424
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,880
...for I have met someone.

425
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,500
It's not important who it is.

426
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,090
It's Sue Storm.

427
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,260
I'm so sorry,
but DeBrie believes in me,

428
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,220
and she stopped my heart, too.

429
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:39,300
If you're wondering what "too"
referred to, it was this:

430
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:40,640
Let's do this.

431
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,140
Blackout.

432
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,350
And scene, as they say.

433
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,750
Her heart stopped!
She-She's dying!

434
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:48,230
Please, someone!
She had too much butter!

435
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,730
- She's a very famous actress!
- Someone say "butter" out here?

436
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:51,480
Oh, my God,
that's a butter face.

437
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,780
- How much butter did the patient have?
- I don't know.

438
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,610
- A Star Trek chess set's worth.
- Damn it, that Swappigans

439
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:58,070
puts more people in
this hospital. Make way, people!

440
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,320
We got a 61-year-old male

441
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:00,780
in full cardiac arrest
coming through.

442
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,040
You have to wait outside, sir.

443
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,330
Be careful of her face!

444
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,120
She's an actress!

445
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,460
It's worth noting that Tobias

446
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,790
had heard this hospital
in Orange County

447
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,380
was a favorite
of show business big shots

448
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,880
seeking plastic surgery.

449
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,010
We're both actors!

450
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,140
On the day of Lucille's trial,

451
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,440
Tobias was in a hospital
with a woman

452
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,150
he'd both fallen for
and had rushed into an ICU.

453
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:31,900
See? Makeup makes everyone
feel a little better.

454
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,400
You didn't leave me.

455
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,320
Everybody leaves me.

456
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,110
I've been left in Dumpsters
and on a curb and...

457
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,660
Oh, I wouldn't dream of it.

458
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,080
Excuse me. Could you, uh,
leave us alone for...

459
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,830
- Yeah, absolutely, yes.
- Thank you.

460
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:47,120
Oh, no, I-I'd like him
to-to stay.

461
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,210
- Really?
- Yeah.

462
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,210
Okay.

463
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,500
I'm afraid that you have

464
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,420
tested positive
for chlamydia, syphilis,

465
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,880
gonorrhea, hepatitis,
pancreatitis,

466
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,220
trichomonitis,
nongonococcal urethritis.

467
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:00,180
All the itises, really,
and there's also

468
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,430
a host of osises.

469
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,180
Now, what this means
in nonmedical terms

470
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,140
is that you have landed, uh,
a real party girl.

471
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,060
Well, will she be okay?

472
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,770
Well, we can treat
all of these things,

473
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,440
but if she's really
gonna be okay,

474
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,440
uh, she's gonna have to tackle
this drug problem.

475
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,690
You didn't tell me
you had a drug problem.

476
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:17,900
We met at a methadone clinic.

477
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:18,900
Are you high?

478
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,360
We met at an acting class.

479
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:22,120
The Method One...

480
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,830
There it is. I'm gonna let
you guys, uh, hash this out.

481
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,910
I guess I shouldn't have
lied about being clean

482
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:30,170
when I took that methadone,
but I'll do better this time.

483
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,500
Or are you gonna leave me

484
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,710
now that you know
that I'm a druggie?

485
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:37,050
DeBrie, look, some people
struggle with addiction,

486
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:39,670
other people are incapable
of ever being nude.

487
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,220
Everybody has something.

488
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:44,260
And it's my professional opinion
that your drug use

489
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:48,230
is a direct result of your
abandoning your dream of acting.

490
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:50,020
You are a gifted actress.

491
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:52,020
When I first saw Straight Bait,

492
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,360
there were two men making love,

493
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,400
but I couldn't take
my eyes off of you.

494
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,150
You watched Straight Bait?

495
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,690
Oh, just2, 4and9.

496
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,110
You were with a guy
who didn't care about you.

497
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:04,370
But stick with me,
and I'll make you famous.

498
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:08,120
By cashing in
on your most celebrated role.

499
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,290
Come one, come all!

500
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:11,750
Get your photo taken
with Sue Storm

501
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,250
from the Fantastic Four!

502
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:14,880
Hey, is that Jessica Alba?

503
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,800
No, this is the original
Sue Storm, DeBrie Bardeaux!

504
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,710
- Who?
- The original Sue Storm,

505
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,340
DeBrie Bardeaux. She--
No, no!

506
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,340
No free pictures, kids!

507
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,340
No, no, scram!

508
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:24,390
Get out of here! Go!

509
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,720
Go, get out of here.

510
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,260
I don't think this is working.

511
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,640
Maybe I need to get
a regular job.

512
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,810
I do have a law degree.

513
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:33,690
I know, I know,
and I'm a doctor.

514
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:35,650
But no, let's not settle.

515
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,650
Look, it's the Fantastic Four.

516
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:40,190
No one recognizes one alone.

517
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,570
I've got an idea.

518
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:43,700
Ten dollars gets you
a picture with

519
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,950
real Hollywood characters!

520
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:46,160
What do you say? Ten dollars.

521
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,160
That's certainly cheap.

522
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,410
Oh! Hello, young man,

523
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:51,700
and his... uncle? Neighbor?

524
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,000
Father.

525
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,290
Oh! That's terrific.

526
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:55,710
Well, how would you like

527
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,090
to have your picture taken

528
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:59,960
with real Hollywood
movie land characters?

529
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,380
Are you the Smurfs?

530
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,970
No, no, no.

531
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:04,550
They're the Ambiguously Gay Duo.

532
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:05,890
Oh, I assure you,

533
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:07,720
there's nothing ambiguous
about me.

534
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,010
I'm Johnny Storm,
the human flamer.

535
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:13,850
And this is Sue Storm, my sister
and fellow fighter-in-law.

536
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:16,020
Now watch as I get--
no, I have special effects!

537
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,900
Look, children love fire.

538
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,940
Oh.

539
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:19,940
This isn't working either.

540
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,610
You're right.

541
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:24,070
Two people in blue
doesn't say Fantastic Four.

542
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,780
You know what though?

543
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,870
I think I may have
just the thing.

544
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:29,080
Oh?

545
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,160
Just "the thing."

546
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,620
Cut to...

547
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,210
Now that I'm the iconic
rock man The Thing,

548
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,830
no one will misunderstand.

549
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:39,590
I'm sure the Blues Brothers here
will know who we are.

550
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:41,460
Excuse me, are you Sue Storm
and The Thing?

551
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,300
Oh, who's smart now?

552
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,010
Indeed we are.

553
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:47,140
In fact, they were orthodox
members of the law firm

554
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,850
Feinberg, Feinberg, Feinberg
& Feinberg.

555
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:52,600
We represent Stan Lee
and Marvel Enterprises.

556
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,270
This is a cease and desist

557
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,060
ordering you
to stop impersonating

558
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,730
any of our trademark characters.

559
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:59,230
Oh, let me take a look at that.

560
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,320
I have a law degree.

561
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,530
No, DeBrie, I've got this.

562
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:03,730
Mr. Feinberg?

563
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,400
Uh, would it change your mind

564
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:09,490
if I offered you
a free Sue Storm armband?

565
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,410
It did not change his mind.

566
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:14,160
And although the hate crime
charges were dismissed,

567
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,910
they were told
they could not continue

568
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,420
to pose as the Fantastic Four.

569
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,170
Can they really make us leave
Hollywood Boulevard?

570
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:23,300
Well, apparently in
this instance, paper beats rock.

571
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,300
You have a rock?

572
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,630
No, I am your rock now.

573
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,680
Oh.

574
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,840
So what are we gonna do

575
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:30,550
now that we don't
have the rights?

576
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,350
Well, we just go off-brand.

577
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:35,930
Uh, we'll just change the names
and do a cheap generic knockoff.

578
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,730
Kids don't care.

579
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:39,480
Tobias took them down
to a street

580
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,190
near Harbor Boulevard,
where his friend Gary Goose

581
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:43,770
told him
they didn't police very much.

582
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,700
Rock Monster and Ability
to Be Invisible Person.

583
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,320
Hello, young man.
What brings you

584
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,280
to at least 500 feet
past the entrance of Disneyland?

585
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,450
Dad, can I get my picture taken

586
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:52,620
with The Thing
and Invisible Girl?

587
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,160
They're the Fantastic Four.

588
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,160
Well, actually, technically,
I'm Rock Monster,

589
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,500
and this is
Ability to Be Invisible Person.

590
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,420
- Hey, you guys want the ten dollars or not?
- Yeah.

591
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,960
- Uh...
- Yeah, yeah.

592
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,670
Yes. Okay.

593
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:06,260
We're The Thing
and the Invisible Girl.

594
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,380
- You're under arrest.
- What?

595
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,930
Boom. Turn around.

596
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,300
- Let's go.
- I didn't...

597
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:11,720
- Let's go. Get up there.
- Oh! Oh!

598
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,510
Come on.

599
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,520
- Oh, come on, now.
- No, no, no.

600
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,930
We're not gonna kill him,
we're just gonna handcuff him.

601
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,560
You can't shoot us
'cause it's not a felony.

602
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,690
Keep your eyes on her.
I'll be right back.

603
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:23,690
Okay.

604
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,400
If it happens again,

605
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,530
you know, it will be
a third strike.

606
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:31,240
Three-strikes law's up for
review in the appellate courts,

607
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,570
but we really
shouldn't be charging.

608
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,330
I know of a street
in Garden Grove

609
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:36,330
- where they don't police very much.
- Okay.

610
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:37,870
Things were looking down.

611
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:40,540
And over the following weeks,

612
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:42,380
their financial situation
grew dire enough

613
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,670
for this to happen.

614
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,590
We're broke.

615
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,550
But you can't sell
your Fantastic Four costume.

616
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:48,920
I mean, that would be
like a fisherman

617
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:50,970
selling his fishing costume.

618
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:53,220
No, I was gonna
have sex with him.

619
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,800
For money.

620
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:56,510
What? No. Put that back on.

621
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,520
You don't have to
degrade yourself this way.

622
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,690
Hey, I'm not a thing.

623
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:02,940
Hey, I am a Thing.

624
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:05,520
And so, with no other options,
Tobias returned

625
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:07,020
to his in-laws' penthouse,

626
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:09,990
desperate enough
to ransack the place,

627
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:12,950
when it appeared
someone had beaten him to it.

628
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:14,780
Michael.

629
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,490
No, George Michael.

630
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:18,410
Somebody, help!

631
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:20,330
And that's when he heard
what sounded like two ostriches

632
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:22,460
making love to a pop hit.

633
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,170
But was actually this.

634
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:27,710
♪ Why don't you
go away, go away ♪

635
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,260
♪ Get away, get away ♪

636
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,220
♪ Stay away ♪

637
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,800
♪ You're hopelessly
hopeless... ♪

638
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,220
Good bird.

639
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,270
Stop it, chicken!

640
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:41,480
Somebody help!

641
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,690
Lucille 2!

642
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:44,520
Help! Help!
Kevin, give me a hand!

643
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,060
Get Dr. Bowman or Alicia.

644
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,440
Either one.

645
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,610
This woman's been
attacked by an ostrich!

646
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:51,570
Ah, Tobias got a new girlfriend.

647
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:58,080
Tobias had acted like
an actual superhero

648
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,200
- and saved Lucille 2.
- There's my hero.

649
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,700
You know, the doctor said

650
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,000
if that bird had gotten through

651
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,960
my second layer of makeup,
it could've done

652
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,210
permanent damage to my skin.

653
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:06,960
And I want to repay you.

654
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,630
You're a doctor,
and you're out of work.

655
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:11,550
- Well...
- How would you like to come work for me,

656
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,010
at Austerity?

657
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:15,050
The rehab center? That's yours?

658
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:17,090
Well, my brother Argyle
runs it day to day.

659
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,300
But we are so understaffed.

660
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,810
You'd be such a gift.

661
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:22,890
It would only pay
120 grand a year to start.

662
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:25,140
Tobias, whose girlfriend
had nearly

663
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:27,560
sold her body for money
in front of him,

664
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:30,820
knew that everyone at some time
has to face reality.

665
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:36,990
- But that this wasn't the time.
- No.

666
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,740
- You turned it down?!
- Uh-huh.

667
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:41,620
I almost  a guy
for a hamburger,

668
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,540
and you turned down
$120, 000 a year?

669
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,000
To keep our dream alive,
yes, I did.

670
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,750
I thought you'd be proud of me.

671
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:50,670
After all, a doctor in India

672
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:53,260
told me that I have the gift
to make people laugh.

673
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,920
Why are you crying?

674
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:57,010
You're worse than Marky.

675
00:24:57,050 --> 00:25:01,010
He couldn't see me,
but you can't hear me.

676
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,520
The setback sent
an emotionally fragile DeBrie

677
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,230
back to her old ways.

678
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:10,820
And before long,
she was picked up by a limo

679
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,570
for a night of
being passed around

680
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:15,030
amongst Hollywood creeps.

681
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:19,070
For three weeks, Tobias waited,
hoping DeBrie would return.

682
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,290
Perhaps it was
the morning he awoke to find

683
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:23,870
two bums using him as a pillow

684
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:26,080
that he realized
she wasn't coming back.

685
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,670
Who are you supposed to be?

686
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:30,170
Oh, I'm The Thing
from Fantastic Four.

687
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:33,170
You've been served, (bleep).

688
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:35,760
Oh, (bleep) me.

689
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,590
Are you undercover as well?

690
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:39,550
I'm CIA.
Not here for you though.

691
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:41,930
Scoping out
Imagine Entertainment.

692
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:44,350
So, with nowhere to go...

693
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:46,060
Thought I'd try you again.

694
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,770
...and no one to help him
out of his rock suit...

695
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:49,900
Honey, you read
comic books, yes?

696
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,440
...he went to see
if his daughter

697
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,940
would give him a place to stay.

698
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:01,280
Now the fun begins,
right, Officer Three?

699
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,160
I'll say.

700
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,750
...and why and how. Who, what,
when, where, why and how.

701
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,920
Is there a little girl here
all by herself?

702
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,250
And perhaps it was this
that would finally

703
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:14,840
get him to admit
that he sometimes did speak

704
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,550
in a misleading way.

705
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:19,380
Daddy needs to get
his rocks off.

706
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:26,850
On the next
To Entrap a Local Predator...

707
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:28,850
I'll be down in a minute.

708
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:30,650
Have some lemonade.

709
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:32,440
Predator gets
its first rock-solid case.

710
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,150
Pretty good lemonade, huh?

711
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:36,440
It is.

712
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,150
Is there alcohol in here--
John Beard!

713
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,150
Please, have a seat.

714
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,150
Okay.

715
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,320
Why are you here?

716
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,740
I'm here to see my little girl.

717
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,990
I wanted to show her
Daddy's Thing.

718
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,330
What are you doing here?

719
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:49,120
I'm doing a, um,
a local interest piece.

720
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,120
Mm.

721
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,210
Okay, get in there, boys.

722
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:52,920
Oh, really local.

723
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,960
That's right, yeah.

724
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,040
Is this about my daughter?

725
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:56,210
Oh, so it's your daughter

726
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:57,920
- you're here to see?
- Yes.

727
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:00,050
Maeby.

728
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:01,930
If he's got a daughter,
then how old is she?

729
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:03,050
Let me ask you this.

730
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:04,050
How old is she?

731
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:06,100
Oh.

732
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,970
Why do you put me on the spot?

733
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:10,890
Um, I want to say 19?

734
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:13,480
But I like
to think of her as 15.

735
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,520
Well, you're free to go.

736
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,150
She's not here.

737
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:17,870
But this creep won't take "go"

738
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,320
- for an answer.
- Oh, that's all right.

739
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,900
I'll stay, I'll wait.

740
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:22,910
And this creep makes himself
right at home.

741
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:24,910
- Give me just a minute.
- He's not leaving.

742
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,870
- He's not leaving.
- He's not leaving.

743
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:28,790
Tell him there's a raccoon
in the backyard.

744
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:30,370
Hey, guess what.

745
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:32,160
There's a raccoon
out on the patio!

746
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:33,230
Bull (bleep).

747
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,520
Where is that little guy?

748
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,420
And this guy turns out to be
a real comedian.

749
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:40,150
I just broke my skull
in a fourth place:

750
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,750
the patio!
