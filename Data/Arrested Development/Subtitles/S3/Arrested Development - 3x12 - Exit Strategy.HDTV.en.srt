1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,900
It's... Attested Development

2
00:00:05,289 --> 00:00:08,988
Michael was preparing his sister for her upcoming deposition

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,544
in the case against their father.

4
00:00:10,637 --> 00:00:14,569
If they say "Did you know of any financial improprieties," you'll...

5
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:17,051
Unbutton my shirt a bit and give him this look.

6
00:00:18,231 --> 00:00:19,621
Not really sure what you're going for there.

7
00:00:19,722 --> 00:00:21,498
Yeah, I'm sorry, I drank a lot last night.

8
00:00:21,597 --> 00:00:22,538
Yeah, why were you drinking?

9
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:27,341
If I look like a man who made love to his wife last night,

10
00:00:27,436 --> 00:00:29,257
it's because I almost did.

11
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:30,336
That's why.

12
00:00:30,422 --> 00:00:33,590
But Tobias had a low tolerance for alcohol.

13
00:00:34,006 --> 00:00:35,766
You look very...

14
00:00:37,112 --> 00:00:38,709
And so you just finished off the bottle?

15
00:00:38,811 --> 00:00:40,367
Well, I had to. It's vodka.

16
00:00:40,461 --> 00:00:41,874
It goes bad once it's opened.

17
00:00:41,962 --> 00:00:43,692
I think that's another one of Mom's little fibs.

18
00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:46,633
You know, like "I'll sacrifice anything for my children."

19
00:00:46,745 --> 00:00:47,801
Speaking of Mom...

20
00:00:47,901 --> 00:00:50,200
she really doesn't want me to do this deposition.

21
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:52,293
Well, you have to, Lindsay. Sorry, you've been subpoenaed.

22
00:00:52,391 --> 00:00:54,752
I'm afraid I might not be able to be deposed either.

23
00:00:54,843 --> 00:00:59,103
I got a call out of the blue for a chance to play a very important part in

24
00:00:59,222 --> 00:01:01,062
The Prosecution.

25
00:01:01,164 --> 00:01:02,374
The prosecution called you?

26
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:04,298
I assume it's a CBS procedural.

27
00:01:04,386 --> 00:01:06,540
Although they didn't send sides, so I thought I'd trot out

28
00:01:06,621 --> 00:01:08,579
a Vagina Monologue, or something else I know.

29
00:01:08,655 --> 00:01:10,405
And they did ask for old photos and documents

30
00:01:10,486 --> 00:01:12,766
so I went and got these out of the secret room.

31
00:01:13,111 --> 00:01:15,185
The prosecution is not a TV show.

32
00:01:15,266 --> 00:01:18,483
It's clearly somebody in the D.A.'s office trying to get you to flip.

33
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:21,675
These guys will bend the law to enforce the law.

34
00:01:21,795 --> 00:01:24,169
Tell me that's not a CBS franchise.

35
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,700
I'm serious, Tobias. Why else would they want all these documents?

36
00:01:26,798 --> 00:01:28,535
For set dressing, silly.

37
00:01:28,641 --> 00:01:30,872
Those Hollywood shows are so incredibly detailed.

38
00:01:30,973 --> 00:01:32,957
Well, you're going to call them and tell them you're not interested.

39
00:01:33,052 --> 00:01:34,401
We all have to be careful, okay?

40
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:36,740
The prosecution is going to be coming after all of us.

41
00:01:36,845 --> 00:01:37,830
Including me?

42
00:01:37,919 --> 00:01:39,647
Hmm? No. You don't have any secrets.

43
00:01:39,748 --> 00:01:42,129
Oh. Yeah, no, I...

44
00:01:42,552 --> 00:01:45,130
Um, hey, speaking of that, uh...

45
00:01:45,249 --> 00:01:48,714
it's actually her birthday soon, so I thought we could all do something for her.

46
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:49,515
Whose birthday?

47
00:01:49,632 --> 00:01:50,937
Maeby's.

48
00:01:52,453 --> 00:01:56,389
I was changing the subject. We-- no, yeah, we weren't talking about Maeby.

49
00:01:56,495 --> 00:01:58,465
But she's been feeling kind of left out of the family lately

50
00:01:58,568 --> 00:02:01,914
and I thought maybe we could throw her a surprise party, you know.

51
00:02:02,011 --> 00:02:04,356
Actually, he'd already told her about it.

52
00:02:04,463 --> 00:02:06,410
Well, I just poured Mom into bed.

53
00:02:06,518 --> 00:02:08,249
Would it kill her to let some vodka go bad?

54
00:02:08,356 --> 00:02:09,278
Oh, no, vodka doesn't...

55
00:02:09,371 --> 00:02:12,052
You know, it's my birthday in a week and I bet you they don't even know.

56
00:02:12,153 --> 00:02:13,417
They forget every year.

57
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,038
I should just move out.

58
00:02:15,374 --> 00:02:18,033
But they're planning a surprise party for you.

59
00:02:18,137 --> 00:02:20,247
They wouldn't forget your 16th birthday.

60
00:02:20,356 --> 00:02:23,351
Oh, my gosh. Our little girl's turning 14.

61
00:02:23,464 --> 00:02:24,445
16, actually.

62
00:02:24,553 --> 00:02:27,234
Well, I am off to buy the perfect present.

63
00:02:27,334 --> 00:02:29,295
Maybe she'd like a suit like this.

64
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,597
That is her suit.

65
00:02:30,685 --> 00:02:32,659
They probably don't make it in a woman's though.

66
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:34,784
They only make it in a woman's.

67
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,252
Well, I'm off, my love.

68
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,053
You see, sometimes shame can be fun.

69
00:02:38,167 --> 00:02:38,838
Shame?

70
00:02:39,591 --> 00:02:40,426
Secrets.

71
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:42,356
You said "shame."

72
00:02:42,466 --> 00:02:44,063
He said "shame."

73
00:02:45,495 --> 00:02:47,025
How does he know about her?

74
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,268
Didn't he say that Gob should be ashamed of himself?

75
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,997
No, but give it a little while, somebody will.

76
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,202
What's all that for?

77
00:02:52,532 --> 00:02:53,944
It's for my out of town act.

78
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:55,134
Out of town?

79
00:02:55,243 --> 00:02:58,130
Gob, the prosecution is watching every move we make.

80
00:02:58,227 --> 00:02:59,845
Michael, I'm just going to Iraq.

81
00:03:00,045 --> 00:03:00,844
No, you're not.

82
00:03:00,938 --> 00:03:01,342
Yes, I am.

83
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:04,988
No, you're not. Dad is up on treason charges for building homes in Iraq.

84
00:03:05,086 --> 00:03:05,995
It's a USO tour.

85
00:03:06,092 --> 00:03:07,195
- You're not going.
- Yes, I am.

86
00:03:07,296 --> 00:03:08,615
And I'm doing my whole Christian magic act

87
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:10,250
that my relig-y girlfriend helped me work out.

88
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,807
I dress up like Jesus, walk on water, which you've seen.

89
00:03:12,911 --> 00:03:14,108
And I do the wine into water...

90
00:03:14,218 --> 00:03:15,603
It's "water into wine."

91
00:03:15,858 --> 00:03:19,574
Then I emptied out all your wine bottles and filled them with fake stuff for nothing.

92
00:03:19,678 --> 00:03:22,610
Great, how am I supposed to have sex with my husband now?

93
00:03:22,796 --> 00:03:24,771
Gob, we've got the depositions, okay?

94
00:03:24,863 --> 00:03:25,981
You're not going to Iraq.

95
00:03:26,153 --> 00:03:28,955
You're just jealous that I am the son that the father has asked

96
00:03:29,058 --> 00:03:31,371
to do his work in the Holy Land.

97
00:03:31,471 --> 00:03:33,023
So Dad is behind this.

98
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,132
And he won't bump me up to business class.

99
00:03:35,501 --> 00:03:39,607
Later that day, Tobias met with the prosecutor, Wayne Jarvis.

100
00:03:39,714 --> 00:03:41,433
"A flower in my garden,

101
00:03:41,548 --> 00:03:44,014
a mystery in my panties."

102
00:03:44,128 --> 00:03:46,696
Again, this is not an audition for a CBS show.

103
00:03:46,786 --> 00:03:48,865
I was just looking for some feedback.

104
00:03:49,045 --> 00:03:50,845
It  was a little contrived.

105
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:53,153
Now, we think we can offer you a good deal

106
00:03:53,252 --> 00:03:56,531
if  you provide evidence that puts George Bluth behind bars.

107
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:58,605
Well, I'll tell you what else is contrived, the odds that

108
00:03:58,699 --> 00:04:01,794
I would turn on my family for somebody who are not only trying to hurt them,

109
00:04:01,888 --> 00:04:04,287
but who wouldn't know good acting if it marched through the door

110
00:04:04,382 --> 00:04:06,928
and gave them headshots and decorative soaps.

111
00:04:07,635 --> 00:04:12,390
And as Tobias waited for the elevator, he noticed an interesting flier,

112
00:04:12,506 --> 00:04:16,807
promising the perfect gift for the daughter who didn't feel a part of the family.

113
00:04:16,903 --> 00:04:17,757
He took the bait.

114
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:20,159
He's a classic scrapbooker.

115
00:04:20,264 --> 00:04:22,464
Right down to the woman's suit.

116
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,480
And Michael went to confront his father about Gob's trip to Iraq.

117
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,536
Everyone knows that you built homes for Saddam Hussein.

118
00:04:28,633 --> 00:04:29,506
Please tell me what's going on.

119
00:04:29,616 --> 00:04:32,548
For the millionth time, I was a patsy.

120
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:34,417
I've got to find a loophole to get out of this,

121
00:04:34,536 --> 00:04:38,875
but Buster took coma, and your mother took rehab.

122
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:41,303
You're going to rehab again?

123
00:04:41,397 --> 00:04:42,859
I'm bringing Lindsay.

124
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,289
I'm worried about her.

125
00:04:44,395 --> 00:04:45,789
Did you get the corkscrew?

126
00:04:46,801 --> 00:04:48,830
So there's going to be wine at the rehab, huh?

127
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,123
Well, wine only turns into alcohol if you let it sit.

128
00:04:52,776 --> 00:04:54,171
How do you come up with these?

129
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,869
So I guess I'll just meet with the prosecutor, ask for a postponement,

130
00:04:56,949 --> 00:04:59,558
but that means I'm going to have to go on the record about why you two aren't there.

131
00:04:59,649 --> 00:05:01,591
And if you make a liar out of me, we're gonna be in big trouble.

132
00:05:01,686 --> 00:05:04,415
This constant bickering is going to put me in a coma!

133
00:05:04,536 --> 00:05:05,584
Nice try, Dad.

134
00:05:05,697 --> 00:05:09,239
But Buster was finding his fake coma hard to sustain.

135
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:12,586
It takes a lot of courage to endure what they put you through.

136
00:05:12,692 --> 00:05:15,615
Especially since your mother saw that website.

137
00:05:15,729 --> 00:05:19,849
Buster was not only providing medical students a live body to learn on...

138
00:05:19,957 --> 00:05:21,190
That's okay. Try again...

139
00:05:21,301 --> 00:05:24,308
No, that's a tendon. He'd be screaming right now.

140
00:05:24,406 --> 00:05:25,970
It's okay. try again.

141
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,200
...he'd also served as a human canvas for aspiring beauticians...

142
00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:32,805
That's okay, you put too much collagen in there.

143
00:05:32,906 --> 00:05:33,931
No, no, try it again.

144
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:37,406
...and a much needed set of teeth for a dental program

145
00:05:37,532 --> 00:05:39,540
designed to encourage at-risk youths.

146
00:05:39,646 --> 00:05:40,906
That's okay, Turf.

147
00:05:41,001 --> 00:05:42,325
No, try again.

148
00:05:42,826 --> 00:05:46,525
Oops, you've got your forearm right on his windpipe there, Dogbone.

149
00:05:46,645 --> 00:05:48,970
It really was amazing for their self-esteem.

150
00:05:49,075 --> 00:05:50,046
I did it.

151
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,667
Even Buster was moved.

152
00:05:52,816 --> 00:05:55,313
But he endured it all for Adelaide.

153
00:05:55,417 --> 00:05:56,933
I love you, Buster.

154
00:05:57,044 --> 00:06:00,288
Oh, what I would give to hear you say you love me, too.

155
00:06:00,409 --> 00:06:03,508
Even if it meant you'd been faking this whole time.

156
00:06:03,627 --> 00:06:04,571
Speak to me.

157
00:06:04,689 --> 00:06:07,154
Say anything, my love.

158
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,823
Anything?

159
00:06:09,696 --> 00:06:10,465
Faker!

160
00:06:10,567 --> 00:06:12,384
No, I wasn't faking my love for you.

161
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,508
I just don't want to testify at my dad's trial.

162
00:06:14,613 --> 00:06:15,864
Well, you're a coward!

163
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:16,313
No.

164
00:06:16,413 --> 00:06:19,660
Adelaide, how could you let this happen again?

165
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:23,149
I wish you'd come to. Don't you care about me?

166
00:06:23,266 --> 00:06:25,461
Of course I care about you.

167
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:26,662
Faker!

168
00:06:26,788 --> 00:06:29,141
Oh, how could I let this happen to me again?

169
00:06:29,268 --> 00:06:33,363
Take a single step to show me your love, Gary.

170
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:34,921
Faker!

171
00:06:35,143 --> 00:06:36,717
She was wrong on that one.

172
00:06:36,824 --> 00:06:39,401
It was love that made Gary take that step.

173
00:06:39,507 --> 00:06:42,736
Oh, whoever said vegetables were good for your heart.

174
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,374
No, no, no. No, please.

175
00:06:45,361 --> 00:06:48,886
Of course, he hadn't used his legs in three weeks.

176
00:06:49,004 --> 00:06:50,734
And Michael met with Wayne Jarvis.

177
00:06:50,826 --> 00:06:53,336
I apologize for the rest of my family not being here.

178
00:06:53,435 --> 00:06:56,831
They wanted to testify, but they all have perfectly legal excuses.

179
00:06:56,924 --> 00:06:59,379
And I can assure you that no one is hiding.

180
00:06:59,487 --> 00:07:03,166
Michael,  your mother and your sister are not in a rehab center.

181
00:07:03,255 --> 00:07:04,165
Where are they really?

182
00:07:04,261 --> 00:07:04,950
We don't know.

183
00:07:05,051 --> 00:07:07,621
But we do know that the two people who checked into Shady Pines

184
00:07:07,725 --> 00:07:12,146
under the names Lucille Bluth and Lindsay Funke are not your relatives.

185
00:07:12,249 --> 00:07:13,731
Also, for someone in a coma,

186
00:07:13,847 --> 00:07:16,757
 your brother Buster has made an impressive 15 phone calls

187
00:07:16,866 --> 00:07:20,451
to radio stations alternately requesting "I Will Survive" and...

188
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:21,084
what was the other one?

189
00:07:21,184 --> 00:07:22,588
"She's Out Of My Life."

190
00:07:22,685 --> 00:07:24,002
"She's Out Of My Life."

191
00:07:24,117 --> 00:07:26,634
As for your brother Gob in the USO...

192
00:07:26,741 --> 00:07:28,059
Don't tell me he's not in Iraq.

193
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,207
Oh, no, he's there.

194
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:32,154
In fact, Michael, he's on the news right now.

195
00:07:34,063 --> 00:07:37,189
Are bees better at sniffing out drugs than dogs?

196
00:07:37,283 --> 00:07:38,254
I'm sure it's coming right up.

197
00:07:38,371 --> 00:07:39,722
They've been playing it all day.

198
00:07:39,829 --> 00:07:42,122
...and they deliver insulin right to my door.

199
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:44,511
I'm sure it's right after this series of ads.

200
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,566
It's like every time you turn on the TV.

201
00:07:46,689 --> 00:07:48,269
Why don't we just go on-line?

202
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:49,830
Cool your Japanese jets.

203
00:07:50,068 --> 00:07:53,019
An insurgent in Iraq from Orange County, California?

204
00:07:53,109 --> 00:07:57,315
Why he's being held in jail, and why he won't be coming home any time soon.

205
00:07:57,409 --> 00:08:01,900
And imagine the impact if that had come on right when we turned on the TV.

206
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:08,931
Michael had been called to sign his brother out of the hospital.

207
00:08:09,034 --> 00:08:10,833
Buster, you can stop pretending to be in a coma.

208
00:08:10,939 --> 00:08:12,559
We just heard your request on the way over.

209
00:08:12,623 --> 00:08:14,054
I'm not faking it, Michael.

210
00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:16,023
I really am this expressionless.

211
00:08:16,131 --> 00:08:17,899
My love thinks I'm a coward

212
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,954
just because I was using precious hospital resources to avoid my legal obligation.

213
00:08:22,055 --> 00:08:23,039
That does say "coward."

214
00:08:23,145 --> 00:08:23,630
Yeah.

215
00:08:23,722 --> 00:08:26,570
We've got bigger problems. Gob is locked in a prison in Iraq.

216
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:27,115
What?

217
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:29,100
So he's actually in an Iraqi prison?

218
00:08:29,194 --> 00:08:30,772
No, it's U.S.-run.

219
00:08:30,914 --> 00:08:32,475
God knows what they're doing to him.

220
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,728
Mom  and Lindsay are pretending to be in rehab.

221
00:08:34,825 --> 00:08:39,250
I can't get a hold of Dad. And I have to fly to Iraq myself to get Gob.

222
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,737
Do you have to go by yourself?

223
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,726
Let me go with you.

224
00:08:42,844 --> 00:08:44,909
I was trained by Army.

225
00:08:45,014 --> 00:08:46,589
I speak the language.

226
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:47,777
You speak Arabic?

227
00:08:47,867 --> 00:08:48,696
La-ach-ha-tem.

228
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:49,519
What's that mean?

229
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,222
No, I was just clearing my throat,

230
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:54,525
but I think it actually does mean "laundry" but like, a child's laundry.

231
00:08:54,621 --> 00:08:55,903
We don't really have a word for it.

232
00:08:56,017 --> 00:08:59,283
But this is exactly what I need to prove to my love

233
00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:01,778
that I'm a hero, not a coward.

234
00:09:01,896 --> 00:09:04,339
And  I have my uniform here. Mother brought it for the photo shoot.

235
00:09:06,016 --> 00:09:08,319
But would you be back in time for Maeby's surprise party?

236
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:09,010
Probably not.

237
00:09:09,106 --> 00:09:10,797
We'll do something when I get back, okay?

238
00:09:10,897 --> 00:09:12,624
Now why don't you go ahead and drive the staircar home

239
00:09:12,743 --> 00:09:14,299
and Buster and I'll leave from here.

240
00:09:14,412 --> 00:09:15,371
Well, be careful.

241
00:09:15,463 --> 00:09:17,877
Hey. Who's tougher than us?

242
00:09:21,406 --> 00:09:22,319
Close one.

243
00:09:25,202 --> 00:09:27,104
The depositions had been delayed,

244
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:31,225
but the prosecution was about to get a Lord & Taylor bag full of evidence.

245
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,997
We supply the glitter, the glue, the crepe paper

246
00:09:34,095 --> 00:09:38,049
and the ready-made template pages for you to decorate and fill out with...

247
00:09:38,276 --> 00:09:39,917
"My Favorite Birthday,"

248
00:09:40,421 --> 00:09:42,284
"Foreign Bank Statements,"

249
00:09:42,834 --> 00:09:46,109
and of course, "Shh! Family Secrets."

250
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:48,950
The scrapbooking sting had helped the D.A. gather evidence

251
00:09:49,036 --> 00:09:52,540
against people as diverse as Ken Lay...

252
00:09:54,512 --> 00:09:55,993
 ...Oliver North

253
00:09:56,777 --> 00:09:59,628
but ironically not Martha Stewart.

254
00:09:59,737 --> 00:10:02,122
So dig up whatever you can

255
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:06,019
and remember, photocopies are not admissible as memories.

256
00:10:06,121 --> 00:10:09,775
Uh, sir, I'm going to have to go or our old family storage unit in Reseda.

257
00:10:09,887 --> 00:10:10,692
No problem.

258
00:10:10,808 --> 00:10:13,048
We can arrange for a helicopter to take you there right now.

259
00:10:13,161 --> 00:10:17,020
Wow, this is the best free scrapbooking class I've ever taken.

260
00:10:17,137 --> 00:10:20,196
Meanwhile Lindsay and Lucille were at a spa in the desert

261
00:10:20,302 --> 00:10:23,280
avoiding both rehab and their depositions.

262
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,718
Four saunas, three steam baths, Olympic sized pool

263
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,335
and you're telling me there's no alcohol?

264
00:10:29,432 --> 00:10:32,221
What the hell are we supposed to do for two days.

265
00:10:32,322 --> 00:10:34,909
I could take the top off this grape juice and maybe by morning...

266
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,970
Oh, for God's sake, Lindsay, grow up.

267
00:10:37,075 --> 00:10:38,590
You're 40 years old.

268
00:10:38,693 --> 00:10:39,790
Thirty-five.

269
00:10:39,917 --> 00:10:41,619
Well, maybe this will be nice.

270
00:10:42,024 --> 00:10:45,851
We can talk... and connect a little.

271
00:10:48,498 --> 00:10:51,474
- I must have a Xanax.
- I'll go score some weed from the staff.

272
00:10:51,821 --> 00:10:54,500
And Michael and Buster checked out of the hospital.

273
00:10:54,598 --> 00:10:56,749
I can't believe they wouldn't even give me a wheelchair ride.

274
00:10:56,859 --> 00:10:59,850
We're going to be sitting on a plane for 18 hours to Iraq.

275
00:10:59,962 --> 00:11:01,856
Yeah, I should definitely get one for the airport.

276
00:11:02,097 --> 00:11:03,357
You're going to Iraq?

277
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:05,791
Yes, I'm going to save my brother.

278
00:11:05,884 --> 00:11:08,660
Oh, so you are brave after all.

279
00:11:08,837 --> 00:11:11,069
Fighting for your brother.

280
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,895
Oh, Buster, you're such a ( bleep ).

281
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:14,826
That means she likes you.

282
00:11:14,943 --> 00:11:15,424
Oh.

283
00:11:15,531 --> 00:11:16,705
It's more than like.

284
00:11:16,823 --> 00:11:19,004
I'd give anything to have you stay here.

285
00:11:19,142 --> 00:11:21,774
Well, then I will stay here. I was scared to go anyway.

286
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:23,173
Faker!

287
00:11:23,286 --> 00:11:24,779
I knew you were no good!

288
00:11:24,903 --> 00:11:27,260
Than I shall go-- to forget you.

289
00:11:27,368 --> 00:11:29,041
Oh, Buster, don't go.

290
00:11:29,148 --> 00:11:30,245
I don't want to go.

291
00:11:30,498 --> 00:11:32,662
I'm going to save everybody a lot of trouble and say that we are going.

292
00:11:32,752 --> 00:11:33,989
He is going. Come on, here we go.

293
00:11:34,095 --> 00:11:38,772
When I miss your lips, I'll put a fig in my mouth and think of you.

294
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,079
They have figs over there, right?

295
00:11:42,238 --> 00:11:43,660
I'll wait for you.

296
00:11:44,181 --> 00:11:45,108
What's this?

297
00:11:45,244 --> 00:11:48,518
Cabdriver said he went into a coma as soon as they pulled up to the hospital.

298
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:51,330
Oh, what a brave man.

299
00:11:51,508 --> 00:11:56,082
And soon the Bluth boys found themselves in a strange land.

300
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,108
What did he say? Where are we?

301
00:12:04,209 --> 00:12:05,820
He said he's taking surface streets to LAX

302
00:12:05,917 --> 00:12:08,397
because the freeway's backed up all the way to Knott's Berry Farm.

303
00:12:08,505 --> 00:12:11,838
George Michael meanwhile got ahold of Maeby's address book

304
00:12:11,952 --> 00:12:15,555
to invite all of her friends to her Sweet 16.

305
00:12:15,665 --> 00:12:19,219
He did however, decide against some guests he found threatening.

306
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:21,553
I don't think Steve Holt has to come to this.

307
00:12:21,798 --> 00:12:24,507
And yet he did invite Mickey Rourke.

308
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:27,437
And the guys finally did get to Iraq.

309
00:12:27,558 --> 00:12:30,033
But Buster's Arabic was a little rusty

310
00:12:30,131 --> 00:12:34,336
and instead of a cab he hired them the only rickshaw in Baghdad.

311
00:12:34,446 --> 00:12:36,747
So you ready for Operation Hot Brother?

312
00:12:36,953 --> 00:12:38,220
I'm not ready to call it that.

313
00:12:38,323 --> 00:12:42,835
And they arrived at the prison the Americans were training Iraqis to run.

314
00:12:43,203 --> 00:12:44,556
What did you forget?

315
00:12:45,047 --> 00:12:46,757
Walk them through the...?

316
00:12:46,845 --> 00:12:47,513
The what?

317
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:48,766
The metal detector.

318
00:12:48,871 --> 00:12:50,707
That's okay. Try again.

319
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,038
My God, you came!

320
00:12:52,152 --> 00:12:53,034
Okay, okay.

321
00:12:53,132 --> 00:12:54,540
Oh, I missed you, Michael!

322
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,775
All right.

323
00:12:56,382 --> 00:12:58,371
Or should I say robot.

324
00:12:58,477 --> 00:12:59,612
What, 'cause I'm not crying?

325
00:12:59,719 --> 00:13:01,924
Maybe you don't have enough RAM to understand this, Michael,

326
00:13:02,003 --> 00:13:04,869
but there's such a thing as brotherly love.

327
00:13:05,163 --> 00:13:07,008
What's he doing here? I thought he was in a coma.

328
00:13:07,105 --> 00:13:09,030
I was trying to prove to this nurse that I'm brave.

329
00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:11,829
I need to get a picture of me with the insurgent. I can send it on my phone.

330
00:13:12,051 --> 00:13:13,850
Why were you arrested by the Americans?

331
00:13:13,947 --> 00:13:15,932
I was just doing a little off-mission street magic.

332
00:13:16,027 --> 00:13:17,209
Trying to make a few dinars.

333
00:13:17,317 --> 00:13:24,988
And that is why Jesus was often referred to as the King of Kings.

334
00:13:25,368 --> 00:13:26,248
Queens.

335
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,773
The King of Queens.

336
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:32,065
And now I would like to behold one of the late great Jesus' biggest illusions,

337
00:13:32,165 --> 00:13:33,677
The Burning Bush.

338
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:38,449
Burn Bush, burn Bush, burn Bush, burn Bush...

339
00:13:38,528 --> 00:13:41,282
But soon the security forces arrived to suppress

340
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:44,955
what now appeared to be an anti-American demonstration.

341
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:46,960
Burn Bush, burn Bush...

342
00:13:47,044 --> 00:13:49,176
That's okay, use your foot.

343
00:13:49,277 --> 00:13:50,448
The thigh bruises.

344
00:13:50,544 --> 00:13:51,283
What doesn't?

345
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:52,176
Try again.

346
00:13:52,283 --> 00:13:53,906
So you weren't doing anything for Dad?

347
00:13:54,005 --> 00:13:56,906
Well, Dad... I mean, he had said if I happened to be in the neighborhood

348
00:13:56,975 --> 00:13:59,993
of Sadr City or Momoon would I mind torching a couple model homes.

349
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,999
But you know, Dad's just trying to keep information out of the hands of the Iraqis.

350
00:14:03,116 --> 00:14:05,028
I have a feeling he was trying to keep information

351
00:14:05,121 --> 00:14:06,726
out of the hands of the federal marshals.

352
00:14:06,827 --> 00:14:09,036
I'm going to go collect my things and say my good-byes.

353
00:14:09,132 --> 00:14:10,028
You guys check me out of here.

354
00:14:10,129 --> 00:14:13,141
Gob, you're an enemy combatant. It's not going to be that easy.

355
00:14:13,232 --> 00:14:17,857
I mean, I'll talk to them, but you might want to prepare for a long stay.

356
00:14:24,182 --> 00:14:26,187
Oh, shoot, I forgot to say good-bye to Yusef.

357
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:28,487
That was a lot easier than I expected.

358
00:14:28,589 --> 00:14:29,917
Almost too easy.

359
00:14:30,033 --> 00:14:31,638
Hey, why aren't we going to the airport?

360
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:34,088
Well, I want to go check out this house Dad asked you to burn down.

361
00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:36,342
See what he's hiding. I think that's it, sir.

362
00:14:38,906 --> 00:14:40,330
Buster, this guy speaks English.

363
00:14:40,418 --> 00:14:42,264
Oh, no. I swallowed a moth.

364
00:14:42,365 --> 00:14:43,805
I'm sorry it took so long,

365
00:14:43,904 --> 00:14:47,410
but the Cheney Expressway was backed up all the way to Halliburton Drive.

366
00:14:49,593 --> 00:14:51,491
Let's  see what all the mystery is about, huh?

367
00:14:51,607 --> 00:14:56,510
And that's when Michael found someone the U.S. government had been able to depose.

368
00:14:56,599 --> 00:14:57,689
Hello.

369
00:14:58,993 --> 00:15:00,905
Take my picture! Take my picture!

370
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:07,228
Michael was in Iraq when he came across a familiar face.

371
00:15:07,345 --> 00:15:08,816
Are you, uh...?

372
00:15:08,911 --> 00:15:10,486
Saddam Hussein.

373
00:15:11,108 --> 00:15:12,752
Look-alike.

374
00:15:13,311 --> 00:15:14,296
Who are you?

375
00:15:14,427 --> 00:15:18,228
I'm Michael Bluth. These are my brothers, Buster and Gob Bluth.

376
00:15:18,329 --> 00:15:21,117
Bluth? Is he here to fix the air-conditioning?

377
00:15:21,213 --> 00:15:23,750
Are you both Saddam Hussein look-alikes?

378
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:26,359
Hardly. Invite them in.

379
00:15:26,473 --> 00:15:29,464
I am behaving like an Uday look-alike.

380
00:15:29,569 --> 00:15:31,310
Come on in. Come on in, guys.

381
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:34,571
I'd always heard that there were Saddam Hussein look-alikes.

382
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:37,464
I guess I'm just a little surprised to see you all living here

383
00:15:37,577 --> 00:15:40,411
in one house that looks so similar to ours.

384
00:15:40,537 --> 00:15:42,701
Scar on that one dude's forehead's got to be a problem.

385
00:15:42,795 --> 00:15:45,622
That's Achmed. Never stops watching the trial.

386
00:15:45,742 --> 00:15:48,050
We are all following it pretty closely.

387
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,436
I understand. They put this guy away you guys are out of a job, huh?

388
00:15:50,544 --> 00:15:53,884
Yes, and we wanted to keep the house for just one more season.

389
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,835
I have a baby on the way.

390
00:15:55,954 --> 00:15:57,852
I do a better Saddam than this guy.

391
00:15:57,967 --> 00:15:59,447
My Saddam would show his teeth.

392
00:15:59,554 --> 00:16:01,413
Yes, to chew the scenery.

393
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,918
And so Michael decided the least he could do

394
00:16:04,013 --> 00:16:05,973
was take a look at the air-conditioning.

395
00:16:06,089 --> 00:16:08,261
But before he did, he decided to see

396
00:16:08,356 --> 00:16:12,203
if there was a secret room in this model home as well.

397
00:16:12,856 --> 00:16:16,429
And that's when Michael discovered the bombshell.

398
00:16:17,547 --> 00:16:18,317
Buster!

399
00:16:18,429 --> 00:16:20,772
And back at the American model home,

400
00:16:20,881 --> 00:16:24,062
none of the invitees had shown up for Maeby's party.

401
00:16:24,169 --> 00:16:25,698
Surprise.

402
00:16:25,803 --> 00:16:26,960
Yeah, that's what I figured.

403
00:16:27,082 --> 00:16:30,780
So, did you send one of these to everyone in my address book?

404
00:16:30,878 --> 00:16:32,327
Yeah. I'm really sorry they didn't come.

405
00:16:32,423 --> 00:16:33,190
I don't know what happened.

406
00:16:33,287 --> 00:16:33,831
I do.

407
00:16:33,944 --> 00:16:35,523
They found out I was 16.

408
00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:38,678
And a lot of us just didn't want to drive down to Orange County.

409
00:16:38,772 --> 00:16:39,515
What are you talking about?

410
00:16:39,634 --> 00:16:41,673
This cost me my job, George Michael.

411
00:16:41,787 --> 00:16:43,535
I was a studio executive.

412
00:16:43,633 --> 00:16:44,879
I made movies.

413
00:16:44,988 --> 00:16:47,035
Well, is that why you've been so stressed out all the time?

414
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,233
Have I been?

415
00:16:48,348 --> 00:16:49,617
You know what, I'm a kid.

416
00:16:49,715 --> 00:16:51,191
I'm going to start acting like one.

417
00:16:51,299 --> 00:16:52,294
What, you're going to drink?

418
00:16:52,391 --> 00:16:53,827
Do you want to join me?

419
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:56,071
Well, I guess if you can run a studio.

420
00:16:56,175 --> 00:17:00,031
But they didn't know it was the fake wine from Gob's magic show.

421
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:00,644
It's good.

422
00:17:00,754 --> 00:17:02,396
And back in Iraq...

423
00:17:02,501 --> 00:17:03,236
What is this?

424
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,389
Looks like a mid-range nuclear warhead.

425
00:17:05,506 --> 00:17:09,168
Has a range capacity of 4,000 to 5,000 nautical miles.

426
00:17:09,275 --> 00:17:11,855
You've got a pretty sophisticated knowledge of this technology.

427
00:17:11,956 --> 00:17:14,497
My God, it makes me want to have an ice-cream cone.

428
00:17:14,596 --> 00:17:15,938
Doesn't this make you want to have an ice-cream cone?

429
00:17:16,037 --> 00:17:16,947
It does make me want to have an ice-cream cone.

430
00:17:17,057 --> 00:17:20,133
You'll have plenty of time for ice cream in prison.

431
00:17:20,237 --> 00:17:22,343
Ice cream sandwiches.

432
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:23,766
CIA undercover.

433
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:27,336
CIA, of course. This explains why it was so easy to get you out of prison.

434
00:17:27,438 --> 00:17:31,695
I knew that if he got out he would lead us right to whatever your dad was hiding.

435
00:17:31,797 --> 00:17:34,597
They'd even created opportunities for this to happen.

436
00:17:34,699 --> 00:17:36,392
Get in the cell, stupid.

437
00:17:36,547 --> 00:17:39,957
You... you... you're the one who didn't even shut the door.

438
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:41,707
Come on!

439
00:17:41,824 --> 00:17:44,556
Yeah, you guys can run this place without us.

440
00:17:44,692 --> 00:17:48,105
As soon as you stop dropping your keys.

441
00:17:48,371 --> 00:17:49,320
Come on!

442
00:17:49,427 --> 00:17:52,603
They'd even staged something called an honor marathon

443
00:17:52,703 --> 00:17:55,209
they thought he was sure to take advantage of.

444
00:17:55,332 --> 00:17:55,842
Come on.

445
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,825
We've been looking for WMD's for years.

446
00:17:58,921 --> 00:18:00,501
WMD's?

447
00:18:00,984 --> 00:18:03,804
This thing is as fake as Achmed's mustache.

448
00:18:03,865 --> 00:18:04,393
See?

449
00:18:04,497 --> 00:18:06,161
Yeah, look, it's a Homefill.

450
00:18:06,266 --> 00:18:09,635
It's the company that makes the fake stuff we fill the model homes with.

451
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,022
What the hell?

452
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:12,739
What is that, a recording device?

453
00:18:12,849 --> 00:18:13,839
This is our stuff.

454
00:18:13,942 --> 00:18:15,608
Okay, I got to call this in.

455
00:18:16,488 --> 00:18:17,487
Buster, please.

456
00:18:17,588 --> 00:18:18,521
Baker.

457
00:18:19,209 --> 00:18:21,054
No, it doesn't sound like CIA East.

458
00:18:21,154 --> 00:18:22,761
I'll check with CIA West.

459
00:18:22,955 --> 00:18:25,120
Did we bug a house in Mamoon?

460
00:18:26,669 --> 00:18:28,590
Yeah. We got some guy named George Bluth

461
00:18:28,696 --> 00:18:30,930
to build houses down there so we could wire them.

462
00:18:31,733 --> 00:18:33,534
Look, I'm Uncle Buster.

463
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:36,710
I'm sorry no one from the family came.

464
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:39,034
Sometimes I wish I wasn't even part of the family.

465
00:18:39,128 --> 00:18:42,175
No, don't... no... I've never wanted to say this...

466
00:18:42,315 --> 00:18:45,950
but you might not even be related to us.

467
00:18:46,005 --> 00:18:46,739
No.

468
00:18:46,854 --> 00:18:48,109
'Cause Gangee once said to me,

469
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,590
your mom might not have ever even been pregnant with you.

470
00:18:50,699 --> 00:18:53,131
Okay, now you're just saying that to make me feel better.

471
00:18:53,245 --> 00:18:56,210
No, I'm... I wouldn't.

472
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:58,379
Everyone still loves you.

473
00:18:59,417 --> 00:19:00,911
Some more than others.

474
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,212
And perhaps it was the fake wine,

475
00:19:03,327 --> 00:19:07,485
but that was the night George Michael and Maeby went to second base.

476
00:19:09,784 --> 00:19:12,349
So my dad was a patsy?

477
00:19:12,808 --> 00:19:16,334
We call them "unintentional operations victims," but yes.

478
00:19:16,443 --> 00:19:18,966
We ran the whole operation through a British building company.

479
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,492
And they contacted my dad for the plans.

480
00:19:20,604 --> 00:19:23,196
I can't believe it-- after all of that he wasn't lying.

481
00:19:23,316 --> 00:19:26,772
Look, we feel terrible because this is really our mistake.

482
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:30,079
But I'm afraid I'm going to have to take you guys out.

483
00:19:30,189 --> 00:19:31,170
Take us out?

484
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:31,778
Where?

485
00:19:31,895 --> 00:19:33,469
I could really go for some Italian.

486
00:19:33,577 --> 00:19:35,362
There is an Olive Garden in Mamoon.

487
00:19:35,479 --> 00:19:37,517
I think he means to shoot you in the head.

488
00:19:37,646 --> 00:19:41,075
But please, at least let him look at the air-conditioning.

489
00:19:41,188 --> 00:19:44,314
Sir, if you're worried about us talking, we will not say a word.

490
00:19:44,438 --> 00:19:47,244
Well, don't be mad, but I have been sending the pictures from my cell phone to my friend.

491
00:19:47,351 --> 00:19:49,740
He doesn't not know what he's saying...

492
00:19:50,728 --> 00:19:51,870
You have?

493
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:56,771
Well, who knows who she sent them to?

494
00:19:59,122 --> 00:20:01,660
Yeah. Yeah, I get it.

495
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:05,140
Looks like you are a hero, Buster.

496
00:20:05,366 --> 00:20:06,783
We both are.

497
00:20:06,895 --> 00:20:07,564
Well...

498
00:20:07,675 --> 00:20:09,294
Okay, looks like you got us.

499
00:20:09,407 --> 00:20:11,828
What can the U.S. government do for you?

500
00:20:11,982 --> 00:20:14,905
We're going to need some business class tickets home.

501
00:20:15,003 --> 00:20:18,783
And direct flights. None of this stopping in Phoenix bull ( bleep ).

502
00:20:18,891 --> 00:20:21,160
And more importantly, maybe we can drop

503
00:20:21,251 --> 00:20:23,316
some of these treason charges against my father.

504
00:20:23,435 --> 00:20:27,478
And I do believe there was some mention of some ice cream.

505
00:20:27,605 --> 00:20:31,131
And so, with Operation Hot Brother a success,

506
00:20:31,234 --> 00:20:33,540
Our American heroes left Iraq.

507
00:20:33,656 --> 00:20:35,743
Take Condoleezza Rice Lane.

508
00:20:35,866 --> 00:20:37,145
It's quicker.

509
00:20:37,223 --> 00:20:38,436
Mission accomplished.

510
00:20:40,234 --> 00:20:42,438
On the next... Arrested Development

511
00:20:42,751 --> 00:20:46,580
Tobias gives his daughter the gift he'd stayed up all night making.

512
00:20:46,692 --> 00:20:49,000
And here's a picture of your mother pregnant.

513
00:20:49,106 --> 00:20:52,084
And here's a whole series of your head starting to crown.

514
00:20:52,204 --> 00:20:55,614
Look at you-- so full of wonder and shock.

515
00:20:55,729 --> 00:20:57,016
You still do it.

516
00:20:57,141 --> 00:20:58,604
And so does he!

517
00:20:59,156 --> 00:21:01,555
Boy, you guys really are related.

518
00:21:01,669 --> 00:21:04,894
And Michael and Gob make an interesting discovery.

519
00:21:04,992 --> 00:21:06,491
You've got the wrong guy.

520
00:21:06,594 --> 00:21:08,776
The real Saddam has a scar on his head.

521
00:21:09,492 --> 00:21:10,804
I'm "No scar."
