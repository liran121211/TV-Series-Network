1
00:00:00,502 --> 00:00:03,575
Now the story of a wealthy family who lost everything

2
00:00:03,632 --> 00:00:07,380
and the one son who had no choice but to keep them all together.

3
00:00:13,254 --> 00:00:15,162
It's... Arrested Development.

4
00:00:18,159 --> 00:00:21,548
Michael Bluth began his day with something he'd never seen before.

5
00:00:21,594 --> 00:00:23,667
I'm hearing good things about the Bluth Company. What do you think?

6
00:00:23,714 --> 00:00:25,886
Good news about his family's housing business.

7
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,485
Old Man Bluth's in jail. I think his son is running the company.

8
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:30,882
Doesn't seem like a total moron to me.

9
00:00:30,937 --> 00:00:32,975
You know what? I've had this thing as a triple sell,

10
00:00:33,017 --> 00:00:35,289
and I am upgrading it, right here, right now!

11
00:00:35,336 --> 00:00:38,971
I think this thing could even go as high as a "Don't Buy."

12
00:00:39,038 --> 00:00:40,281
"Don't Buy!"

13
00:00:40,363 --> 00:00:42,545
Huh? Mom, did you see that?

14
00:00:42,552 --> 00:00:43,784
Don't buy Bluth!

15
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:46,595
You build a house that's good, people are going to want to come...

16
00:00:51,454 --> 00:00:53,523
The sinkhole spread a little bit more last night?

17
00:00:53,604 --> 00:00:55,186
Anyway, I'm going to go to the prison.

18
00:00:55,254 --> 00:00:56,799
I'm going to tell Dad about this news.

19
00:00:56,886 --> 00:00:58,540
I thought you said we shouldn't visit him.

20
00:00:58,616 --> 00:01:00,455
Uh, visit, no. Gloat, yes.

21
00:01:00,526 --> 00:01:03,722
I've worked very, very hard for this. I sold the cabin property to keep us afloat.

22
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,815
I haven't had any time to spend with my son.

23
00:01:05,882 --> 00:01:08,458
Well, now you can spend time with my son.

24
00:01:08,539 --> 00:01:10,956
I want your brother Buster to come live with you.

25
00:01:11,013 --> 00:01:14,811
And it's not because he has that horrible hook for a hand now.

26
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:15,871
It's the snoring.

27
00:01:15,952 --> 00:01:17,090
Listen to this.

28
00:01:17,165 --> 00:01:19,623
This is Buster snoring, Wednesday night.

29
00:01:21,101 --> 00:01:23,167
It's driving me craz...

30
00:01:23,277 --> 00:01:24,615
You won't even know he's here.

31
00:01:24,678 --> 00:01:26,931
You seem more villainous than usual, mom. Are you sober?

32
00:01:27,008 --> 00:01:28,763
Michael, it's 8:00 a.m.

33
00:01:28,836 --> 00:01:30,191
So it's not that.

34
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:32,322
I don't know.

35
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:35,430
Maybe it's because I went off my post-partum medication.

36
00:01:35,496 --> 00:01:38,513
You were still taking that? You had Buster 32 years ago.

37
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,985
And that's how long I've been depressed about him.

38
00:01:41,144 --> 00:01:44,032
Actually, I did go off it in the early '90s,

39
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:45,900
but I didn't like what happened to me.

40
00:01:45,967 --> 00:01:49,669
Claiming she could take it no more, the young mother released the emergency brake,

41
00:01:49,725 --> 00:01:53,606
allowing her car to roll backwards into the nearby lake.

42
00:01:53,692 --> 00:01:54,999
Good for her!

43
00:01:57,175 --> 00:01:58,910
I must have gained three pounds.

44
00:01:58,981 --> 00:02:00,476
Why'd you go off them this time?

45
00:02:00,563 --> 00:02:04,752
Well, apparently, mood-altering medication leads to street drugs.

46
00:02:04,839 --> 00:02:08,669
That's what this very handsome, young doctor said on The Today Show.

47
00:02:09,457 --> 00:02:11,787
That was Tom Cruise, the actor.

48
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:14,664
They said he was some kind of scientist.

49
00:02:15,145 --> 00:02:16,917
Maybe you should get away from Buster.

50
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,395
Why don't you go up to the cabin in the woods?

51
00:02:19,477 --> 00:02:20,870
I thought you said we sold it.

52
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,927
We sold the property. I worked it out so that we could relocate the cabin,

53
00:02:23,999 --> 00:02:26,588
but it is going to be up in Tahoe for another couple of days.

54
00:02:26,661 --> 00:02:29,241
Maybe you can take a date up there.

55
00:02:29,503 --> 00:02:34,015
How am I supposed to find someone willing to go into that musty old claptrap?

56
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:41,294
The cabin! Yes, th... well, that would be difficult, too.

57
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,151
Please get back on the meds, Mom. We miss the old, old you.

58
00:02:49,194 --> 00:02:51,098
I didn't even know that we had a cabin.

59
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:52,353
Ah, ( bleep ).

60
00:02:52,809 --> 00:02:55,794
Well, for what it's worth, Gob, I've never actually been there.

61
00:02:55,871 --> 00:02:57,679
Although he'd often been promised.

62
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,532
Hey, pal. Something's come up.

63
00:02:59,603 --> 00:03:01,969
This nice young lady has lost her puppy,

64
00:03:02,046 --> 00:03:03,811
and your dad's got to help her find him.

65
00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:05,922
Oh, bad news, buddy.

66
00:03:06,008 --> 00:03:08,096
This young lady's dad is sick, and...

67
00:03:08,298 --> 00:03:09,771
I'm taking her to the hospital.

68
00:03:09,844 --> 00:03:13,386
Come on, you're old enough to figure this out. I'm nailing this broad.

69
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:16,367
Pardon me if I don't burst into tears, Michael,

70
00:03:16,443 --> 00:03:18,429
but at least he promised to take you.

71
00:03:18,783 --> 00:03:21,491
He just let me blindly enjoy my childhood.

72
00:03:22,085 --> 00:03:25,182
I didn't even know there was a cabin he wasn't taking me to!

73
00:03:25,302 --> 00:03:27,317
Hmm, mine's sadder.

74
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:29,299
I don't see you crying, robot.

75
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,826
You taste these tears.

76
00:03:30,928 --> 00:03:32,140
Taste my sad, Michael.

77
00:03:32,144 --> 00:03:33,939
I am not going to lick your eye, okay?

78
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:36,907
Well, I will tell you this, Michael...

79
00:03:36,974 --> 00:03:37,906
I don't have a son...

80
00:03:37,978 --> 00:03:38,505
He does.

81
00:03:38,566 --> 00:03:41,982
But if I ever do, I'm either going to take him to the cabin in the woods,

82
00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:44,332
or I'm going to promise to take him and then not take him.

83
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:47,937
But the one thing that I will never do is not tell him

84
00:03:47,982 --> 00:03:51,797
that I'm taking him to a cabin in the woods, and then not take him!

85
00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:53,461
Gob was growing up.

86
00:03:53,758 --> 00:03:57,208
Well, the cabin in the woods is going to be stacked up next to our carport.

87
00:03:57,327 --> 00:04:00,281
But... maybe we should head up there tonight, huh?

88
00:04:00,364 --> 00:04:03,159
One first time...

89
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,389
Taste the happy, Michael.

90
00:04:06,609 --> 00:04:07,541
Taste it.

91
00:04:07,711 --> 00:04:09,231
Tastes kind of like sad.

92
00:04:09,323 --> 00:04:13,635
Michael set off to prison, to tell off his father, when he discovered his son.

93
00:04:13,706 --> 00:04:14,715
George Michael?

94
00:04:15,027 --> 00:04:16,004
Dad. Hey.

95
00:04:16,077 --> 00:04:16,833
What are you doing?

96
00:04:16,906 --> 00:04:19,487
I didn't want to miss you because you've been leaving so early lately.

97
00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:20,970
You slept out here to see me?

98
00:04:21,078 --> 00:04:24,930
Michael had never been so touched by something his son had said...

99
00:04:25,042 --> 00:04:26,296
but it wasn't true.

100
00:04:26,417 --> 00:04:29,972
He was hiding from his cousin, after an awkward incident.

101
00:04:33,218 --> 00:04:35,262
They'd since been trying to avoid each other,

102
00:04:35,347 --> 00:04:38,539
which was difficult, considering they shared a bunk bed.

103
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,829
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

104
00:04:44,615 --> 00:04:46,501
- I'm off to the car.
- I'll be in the crawl space.

105
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,563
Tell you what. How would you like to head up to the cabin?

106
00:04:48,805 --> 00:04:50,274
Can you afford to skip work?

107
00:04:50,354 --> 00:04:54,529
I think the president of a "Don't Buy" company can afford to take a day off.

108
00:04:54,626 --> 00:04:56,090
We're up from "Sell"?

109
00:04:57,138 --> 00:04:59,188
- It's happening, isn't it?
- It's really happening.

110
00:04:59,362 --> 00:05:01,327
And it's time for us to start creating some memories.

111
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,621
You know, there's been enough disappointment in this family.

112
00:05:07,604 --> 00:05:11,173
There's only one sleeping bag, so we're going to have to double up.

113
00:05:11,251 --> 00:05:15,464
Sorry, pal, something came up.

114
00:05:16,769 --> 00:05:17,977
It is worse to know.

115
00:05:18,092 --> 00:05:20,968
Gob was getting life lessons all over the place.

116
00:05:21,005 --> 00:05:24,296
And Michael broke a two-month silence and went to visit his father.

117
00:05:24,308 --> 00:05:25,044
You came!

118
00:05:25,121 --> 00:05:26,308
Someone came!

119
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:30,901
Only to tell you that the company is back on track and it's because you're behind bars.

120
00:05:30,969 --> 00:05:33,855
And now I get to do with my son what you never did with me.

121
00:05:33,943 --> 00:05:35,643
I'm taking him to the cabin.

122
00:05:35,734 --> 00:05:38,152
...scar, and every night they...

123
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:41,120
I'm scarred, too, but my son is not going to be.

124
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:45,288
...and they cover it with soap, and you're supposed to thank them,

125
00:05:45,371 --> 00:05:47,623
- like they're doing you a favor!
- That's all I came to say.

126
00:05:47,668 --> 00:05:50,045
Is there anything you'd like for me to pass on to the family?

127
00:05:50,188 --> 00:05:51,313
I'm your uncle!

128
00:05:51,939 --> 00:05:54,238
I'm your dad's twin brother.

129
00:05:55,078 --> 00:05:56,327
I'm Oscar!

130
00:05:56,532 --> 00:05:58,125
He switched on me.

131
00:05:58,395 --> 00:06:00,173
No one believes me.

132
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:04,797
Unfortunately for Oscar, "You've got the wrong twin" was a very popular alibi.

133
00:06:04,888 --> 00:06:06,496
...you simply got the wrong twin!

134
00:06:06,578 --> 00:06:07,878
We're quadruplets.

135
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,373
You got the wrong two.

136
00:06:09,461 --> 00:06:10,592
We're Larry and Dave.

137
00:06:10,663 --> 00:06:12,383
You want Curtis and Jack.

138
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:15,691
I even started a Web site-- ImOscar.com.

139
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:18,368
I'm innocent, Michael.

140
00:06:18,446 --> 00:06:19,613
I'm Oscar!

141
00:06:19,848 --> 00:06:21,087
.com!

142
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,307
No, no, don't buy it. I'm taking my son to the cabin,

143
00:06:25,373 --> 00:06:29,028
and there's nothing you can say to make me believe that you are not my father.

144
00:06:30,144 --> 00:06:31,476
I understand.

145
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:34,762
Your child comes first.

146
00:06:36,632 --> 00:06:38,337
Oh, my God, you're Oscar.

147
00:06:38,685 --> 00:06:39,904
.com!

148
00:06:45,126 --> 00:06:48,875
So Michael returned to the office to try and free his uncle,

149
00:06:51,767 --> 00:06:55,172
when he realized how much that freedom would cost his employees.

150
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:58,910
Don't buy! We did it, Mikey! We're super rich again!

151
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:01,285
And, I'm going to buy a car. The Volvo.

152
00:07:01,367 --> 00:07:04,624
Lindsay, you're not going to start spending money. And this is not a Volvo...

153
00:07:04,705 --> 00:07:06,057
Oh, that's from sitting on the copier.

154
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,269
- Lindsay, no...
- Michael, I've got nothing!

155
00:07:08,351 --> 00:07:10,767
My husband dumped me and ran off to Vegas with Kitty.

156
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,478
That bleached blonde whore!

157
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:13,809
Well, he's definitely got a type.

158
00:07:13,917 --> 00:07:15,248
I can't believe he left me.

159
00:07:15,341 --> 00:07:19,006
I mean, this, and these and this!

160
00:07:19,101 --> 00:07:20,338
That's the car.

161
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,054
Oh.

162
00:07:21,187 --> 00:07:22,007
This.

163
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,762
Glad I didn't spring for color.

164
00:07:23,849 --> 00:07:26,367
Lindsay, the only reason you want Tobias is because you can't have him.

165
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:29,451
And the second that you can have something, all of a sudden you don't want it.

166
00:07:29,538 --> 00:07:31,033
That's not who I am, Michael.

167
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:33,059
Well, all right, maybe you're right.

168
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,740
Maybe we should get you this car.

169
00:07:34,904 --> 00:07:37,284
Yeah? I don't know, it's so boxy.

170
00:07:39,338 --> 00:07:40,096
Gob?

171
00:07:40,244 --> 00:07:41,452
Oh, Michael.

172
00:07:42,226 --> 00:07:43,081
How's Dad?

173
00:07:43,387 --> 00:07:46,285
Uh, I don't know. It's Oscar who is in prison,

174
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,767
and if I let him out, people will know that Dad is free and those people out there

175
00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:51,267
will end up paying for it.

176
00:07:51,431 --> 00:07:55,696
Dad hasn't tried to contact you, has he?

177
00:07:55,844 --> 00:07:58,599
Yeah, like I'd ever hear from that son of a bitch.

178
00:07:59,874 --> 00:08:02,982
Earlier that day, Gob received a letter from a group

179
00:08:03,058 --> 00:08:07,795
that reunited abandoned sons with their fathers-- called S.A.D.

180
00:08:07,882 --> 00:08:09,474
A father-son reunion?

181
00:08:10,633 --> 00:08:11,975
Dad's still in prison.

182
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:14,077
But now the letter made sense.

183
00:08:14,258 --> 00:08:16,387
That son of a bitch.

184
00:08:16,514 --> 00:08:17,882
Law Offices of Barry Zuckerkorn.

185
00:08:17,994 --> 00:08:19,382
Hi, it's Michael Bluth for Barry.

186
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:21,352
Barry went to Reno to see your father.

187
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,107
Reno? He said he's been visiting my father in prison.

188
00:08:24,246 --> 00:08:26,785
Yeah, Barry says a lot of things he doesn't mean!

189
00:08:28,772 --> 00:08:31,271
Well, I guess I'm going to Reno to look for Dad.

190
00:08:31,353 --> 00:08:33,499
Good luck, favorite son.

191
00:08:34,363 --> 00:08:38,900
So once again Michael went after the father who'd once again abandoned him,

192
00:08:38,982 --> 00:08:42,827
only to find that he was about to do the same to his own son.

193
00:08:44,118 --> 00:08:45,853
It's not happening, is it?

194
00:08:46,012 --> 00:08:47,276
Something came up.

195
00:08:51,537 --> 00:08:54,905
Michael had just told his son they wouldn't be going to the cabin.

196
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,226
Right, but the cabin's in Lake Tahoe.

197
00:08:56,288 --> 00:08:58,116
So I'm saying that's right near Reno. We could just...

198
00:08:58,172 --> 00:09:01,392
Yeah, but you know, this is going to be like an adult trip. Aunt Lindsay will be here. Hi.

199
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:04,494
Hey, why don't you pop a tent in front with your cousin Maeby?

200
00:09:04,664 --> 00:09:05,478
What?! No!

201
00:09:05,565 --> 00:09:07,864
I'm not really the outdoorsy type.

202
00:09:07,951 --> 00:09:10,660
Well, then this is a good chance for you to rub off on her.

203
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:16,962
As Michael set out to find his father,

204
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,231
Gob thought he was doing the same.

205
00:09:19,966 --> 00:09:21,093
There's my guy!

206
00:09:23,107 --> 00:09:24,330
Hey, buddy, come on.

207
00:09:27,085 --> 00:09:29,014
Get them to track down your dad, too?

208
00:09:29,148 --> 00:09:31,226
My dad actually had them track me down.

209
00:09:32,938 --> 00:09:36,326
But it does look like he's not going to show.

210
00:09:37,632 --> 00:09:41,108
I kind of feel like that kid who found the severed hand.

211
00:09:42,119 --> 00:09:43,771
"Hey, Dad, look what I found!"

212
00:09:45,164 --> 00:09:47,258
Anything for his father's approval.

213
00:09:48,845 --> 00:09:50,157
Heartbreaking.

214
00:09:51,472 --> 00:09:52,777
You look familiar.

215
00:09:53,004 --> 00:09:55,251
I think that's because we actually kind of look alike.

216
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:57,432
Remember when I said Gob had a son?

217
00:09:57,524 --> 00:09:58,334
I'm Gob.

218
00:09:58,468 --> 00:10:00,233
I wasn't just saying that.

219
00:10:00,335 --> 00:10:03,858
In high school, Gob became intimate with these girls.

220
00:10:03,961 --> 00:10:05,844
These girls got pregnant.

221
00:10:06,071 --> 00:10:07,828
This one had a baby.

222
00:10:07,945 --> 00:10:10,197
And that baby would grow up to be...

223
00:10:10,417 --> 00:10:11,604
- Steve Holt.
- Steve Holt!

224
00:10:12,306 --> 00:10:15,859
All I ever wanted was to spend a little time with my Dad.

225
00:10:15,912 --> 00:10:17,190
Maybe go camping.

226
00:10:17,233 --> 00:10:19,009
But I guess that'll never happen.

227
00:10:19,182 --> 00:10:21,864
Look, I know this is going to sound kind of crazy, but

228
00:10:21,963 --> 00:10:24,767
my family actually has a cabin in the woods for one more night.

229
00:10:24,871 --> 00:10:27,379
Maybe we could go up to Reno, get the keys and go camping.

230
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:31,465
You know, sort of a son-and-son thing.

231
00:10:31,614 --> 00:10:34,629
If Steve had had a father, he would've warned him not to go

232
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:37,809
into the woods with strange men, but he didn't.

233
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:38,771
Sure!

234
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:39,990
- Let's go!
- Okay!

235
00:10:40,774 --> 00:10:42,602
- This is me right here.
- Oh, okay.

236
00:10:42,688 --> 00:10:44,071
- Camping!
- Whoo!

237
00:10:44,747 --> 00:10:47,154
Michael, meanwhile, arrived in Reno,

238
00:10:47,261 --> 00:10:52,999
a city competing with Las Vegas' successful "What Happens in Vegas Stays in Vegas" campaign,

239
00:10:53,105 --> 00:10:56,104
and set about searching for Barry Zuckerkorn.

240
00:10:56,216 --> 00:11:00,753
I'm looking for a man who's probably in the seedy underbelly of Reno.

241
00:11:00,864 --> 00:11:04,443
Oh, the Christian League had The Seedy Underbelly shut down.

242
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:06,149
Now it's a Swallows.

243
00:11:06,231 --> 00:11:09,394
Swallows was a family-style restaurant by day

244
00:11:09,487 --> 00:11:12,890
- and an anything-goes, pan-sexual bazaar by night.
- Hello, and welcome to Swallows.

245
00:11:12,897 --> 00:11:16,169
Can I interest you in a smoothie or an amyl... Michael!

246
00:11:16,388 --> 00:11:20,582
Tobias, I thought that you were in Vegas with Kitty in the Blue Man Group.

247
00:11:20,664 --> 00:11:26,306
No, as it turns out, the part that I'd destroyed my life to get had already been cast.

248
00:11:26,369 --> 00:11:30,842
The role was filled by George Sr., who used it to hide in plain sight.

249
00:11:30,934 --> 00:11:33,151
That is, until he choked on a marshmallow

250
00:11:33,157 --> 00:11:36,771
and almost died, when no one noticed he'd turned blue.

251
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:41,032
So Kitty suggested we come up here to try out in Reno, and...

252
00:11:41,119 --> 00:11:42,711
Oh, I'll be honest, Michael.

253
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:47,309
Leaving Lindsay was the biggest little mistake I've ever made.

254
00:11:47,421 --> 00:11:50,852
I can't seem to call her, though. Damn, this pride of mine!

255
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:53,950
Tuna melt's up, and you need to flip the cushions in the grind room.

256
00:11:54,026 --> 00:11:55,112
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

257
00:11:55,183 --> 00:11:58,461
Oh, great, now I'm going to be smelling to high heaven like a tuna melt.

258
00:11:58,531 --> 00:12:02,536
Tobias, what would you say if I told you that Lindsay might be willing to get back together with you?

259
00:12:02,627 --> 00:12:04,794
Oh, uh, I'll call her right now!

260
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:07,047
Actually, why don't you let me handle it? You know Lindsay.

261
00:12:07,053 --> 00:12:09,254
- She only wants what she can't have.
- Right.

262
00:12:09,349 --> 00:12:11,906
- What would you do about Kitty?
- I can't lie to you, Michael.

263
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:15,176
Kitty left me two days ago.

264
00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:17,517
There's a blue hand print on the back of your head, Kitty.

265
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:18,945
Are you seeing someone else?

266
00:12:19,011 --> 00:12:21,890
Face it, Tobias. It's over.

267
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,337
Say good-bye to these!

268
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,134
Those are blue, too!

269
00:12:26,359 --> 00:12:27,901
There were blue hand prints on them?

270
00:12:28,007 --> 00:12:30,590
Yes, and I swear to you they weren't...

271
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,184
Yours. No, I know. It all points to Dad.

272
00:12:33,287 --> 00:12:35,652
Dad's in Reno, Kitty's in Reno... Dad's in Kitty.

273
00:12:35,744 --> 00:12:37,736
He must be a Blue Man. I'm gonna go check out the theater.

274
00:12:37,813 --> 00:12:39,789
Okay. I'll meet you there.

275
00:12:40,696 --> 00:12:44,336
I just have to break down the salad bar and set up the leather pony.

276
00:12:44,423 --> 00:12:45,632
What's the leather pony?

277
00:12:45,718 --> 00:12:47,500
I don't know. We don't have that at lunch.

278
00:12:49,092 --> 00:12:51,924
So Michael called Lindsay to say he'd found her husband.

279
00:12:51,996 --> 00:12:53,788
All right, I'm on my way.

280
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:55,796
I'll just bring him back with me.

281
00:12:56,598 --> 00:12:58,073
He wants to come home?

282
00:12:58,176 --> 00:12:59,679
I mean, against his will.

283
00:12:59,794 --> 00:13:02,225
Well, knock him out, if you have to. He's my husband.

284
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:05,103
Just watch the kids like you promised, okay?

285
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:07,243
- I'm not...
- Neither am I.

286
00:13:07,575 --> 00:13:08,651
Hold it.

287
00:13:09,306 --> 00:13:14,026
And the kids found themselves closer than ever on the bumpy road to Reno.

288
00:13:14,831 --> 00:13:15,527
Hello?

289
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:17,211
Lindsay, uh, hey, hi.

290
00:13:17,239 --> 00:13:20,048
Michael said not to call you, but I... I missed you so much.

291
00:13:20,146 --> 00:13:21,733
You miss me?

292
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:24,206
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

293
00:13:24,258 --> 00:13:27,446
I was driving out there, but this is crazy. We have to be realistic.

294
00:13:27,508 --> 00:13:30,032
No, no, but the thing is, I can't leave Kitty.

295
00:13:30,119 --> 00:13:33,340
I just... what with all the sexual intercourse and whatnot.

296
00:13:33,448 --> 00:13:35,041
You bastard!

297
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:37,180
- What are you doing!?
- Nothing!

298
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:41,292
I will be backstage after the Blue Man show, whether Kitty likes it or not.

299
00:13:41,368 --> 00:13:42,873
Sounds good. One quick question, though.

300
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:48,157
What if Kitty's not there and I'm less of a Blue Man and more of a... cocktail waitress?

301
00:13:48,322 --> 00:13:50,152
- She's turning again!
- Hang up! Hang up!

302
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:51,911
I'll see you there. Thank you, bye.

303
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:54,783
Michael was already at the theater looking for George Sr.,

304
00:13:54,864 --> 00:13:57,421
when he ran into Barry doing the same thing.

305
00:13:57,496 --> 00:13:58,629
Hey, Barry.

306
00:13:58,842 --> 00:13:59,878
Hi, Mikey.

307
00:14:00,103 --> 00:14:01,341
So, how much do you know?

308
00:14:01,428 --> 00:14:04,480
I know that Oscar is in prison, and that my father is a Blue Man,

309
00:14:04,551 --> 00:14:06,272
and that you are clearly in cahoots with him.

310
00:14:06,343 --> 00:14:07,741
Ooh, a lot.

311
00:14:07,842 --> 00:14:08,541
Yeah, where is he?

312
00:14:08,606 --> 00:14:12,170
I don't know. I was gonna meet him here, but he must have seen you and run off.

313
00:14:12,267 --> 00:14:16,451
I was gonna give him this: $250,000 and a passport.

314
00:14:17,128 --> 00:14:18,007
Just a passport.

315
00:14:18,104 --> 00:14:19,804
I was up for so long.

316
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:21,555
Barry, you're fired.

317
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:23,410
What?

318
00:14:24,438 --> 00:14:25,667
Just like that?

319
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:26,881
No warning?

320
00:14:26,988 --> 00:14:28,257
You're my only client.

321
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:29,517
What am I supposed to do now?

322
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:30,925
Turn tricks on the street?

323
00:14:31,022 --> 00:14:32,523
How much you think I can get for that, by the way?

324
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:34,612
All right, this is crazy. I've got to let Oscar out of prison.

325
00:14:34,699 --> 00:14:35,871
What about making out?

326
00:14:36,173 --> 00:14:38,672
$50, or is that just L.A.? Am I just...?

327
00:14:44,594 --> 00:14:49,397
Soon, Lindsay arrived at the hotel, and the kids finally faced facts.

328
00:14:49,874 --> 00:14:51,861
Look, it was just a half-kiss, all right?

329
00:14:51,927 --> 00:14:53,740
Maybe that's the reason why we're acting weird.

330
00:14:53,827 --> 00:14:55,410
It's because we didn't finish the kiss?

331
00:14:55,505 --> 00:14:56,509
Is that where...

332
00:14:56,638 --> 00:14:57,897
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I mean...

333
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,711
Do you think we should just finish the kiss, get it out of the way?

334
00:14:59,793 --> 00:15:01,342
Let's get it out of the way!

335
00:15:03,499 --> 00:15:06,150
Hey, kids! Bring the bags, we're sharing a room!

336
00:15:06,264 --> 00:15:08,111
All right, let's meet back here tomorrow morning.

337
00:15:08,224 --> 00:15:09,048
- Okay?
- Yeah.

338
00:15:09,314 --> 00:15:10,289
- Go.
- Oh, you...

339
00:15:10,841 --> 00:15:14,711
Yeah, I'm gonna, um, I'm gonna stay out here and, uh,

340
00:15:14,809 --> 00:15:17,148
and watch that famous Reno sunset.

341
00:15:18,695 --> 00:15:20,231
Isn't it behind you?

342
00:15:21,634 --> 00:15:23,820
There's... Yeah, but there's mirrors.

343
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,514
It'll actually look closer...

344
00:15:25,537 --> 00:15:29,641
While George Michael waited for the sunset, another set of sons arrived.

345
00:15:29,653 --> 00:15:31,172
Michael said he'd meet me here.

346
00:15:31,239 --> 00:15:34,311
I guess I'll get the keys to the cabin... son.

347
00:15:34,957 --> 00:15:37,797
I'll go buy some fishing stuff... son.

348
00:15:38,587 --> 00:15:40,260
So where did you get this kid?

349
00:15:40,347 --> 00:15:41,699
Yeah, I guess I can tell you now.

350
00:15:41,992 --> 00:15:45,390
We were both waiting for our dads at that garden where the little boy found the arm.

351
00:15:45,785 --> 00:15:47,812
The kid's amazing, though. It's almost like...

352
00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:50,081
I wish he could be my dad.

353
00:15:50,172 --> 00:15:53,670
Okay, um, your dad's not trying to find you-- your son is.

354
00:15:53,726 --> 00:15:54,651
That kid's your son.

355
00:15:54,718 --> 00:15:55,726
You're the dad.

356
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,218
Hmm?

357
00:16:02,948 --> 00:16:05,050
I've made a huge, tiny mistake.

358
00:16:05,138 --> 00:16:08,948
No, no, G-G-Gob, Gob, you can't just leave your son in the middle of a parking lot in Reno.

359
00:16:09,045 --> 00:16:12,558
And that's when Michael saw his own son in a parking lot in Reno.

360
00:16:12,645 --> 00:16:15,394
He drove all the way up here to be with me. Wow.

361
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:19,393
Well, I guess I'm, uh, I'm no better than...

362
00:16:22,573 --> 00:16:23,673
No, I'm better.

363
00:16:24,042 --> 00:16:27,554
They were an hour out of Reno when George Michael woke up.

364
00:16:27,638 --> 00:16:30,799
You were out like a light. Pal, our dreams are about to come true.

365
00:16:30,872 --> 00:16:31,583
Maeby?

366
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:33,791
Definitely! We are going camping.

367
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,229
It's finally happening.

368
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,408
It's never happening.

369
00:16:40,646 --> 00:16:44,159
Michael had just surprised his sleeping son by taking him camping.

370
00:16:44,225 --> 00:16:46,621
I put this off too long, and it's too important.

371
00:16:46,688 --> 00:16:49,340
Your Uncle Oscar can stay in prison one more day, right?

372
00:16:49,453 --> 00:16:52,765
Not according to that day's blog on Imoscar.com.

373
00:16:52,863 --> 00:16:55,746
This here is way more important than me trying to find my father.

374
00:16:55,817 --> 00:16:58,837
Although, I was very close. I almost had Pop Up in Reno.

375
00:16:59,899 --> 00:17:00,804
Me, too.

376
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,028
As Michael was forcibly taking his son out to the cabin,

377
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:08,336
Lucille was ready to forcibly throw hers out.

378
00:17:20,562 --> 00:17:22,365
Well, that was a freebie.

379
00:17:22,477 --> 00:17:26,096
Lucille didn't trust herself to be in the house when Buster returned,

380
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,830
so she headed off to the cabin Michael said would be unoccupied.

381
00:17:29,912 --> 00:17:33,066
Tobias, meanwhile, was looking for a way to make his wife jealous

382
00:17:33,147 --> 00:17:37,509
by convincing her that he was not only a Blue Man, but still with Kitty,

383
00:17:37,607 --> 00:17:41,995
when he came across a makeup woman, who, coincidentally, looked a great deal like Kitty.

384
00:17:42,082 --> 00:17:47,633
If this tableau I recreate, perhaps I can re-snare my mate.

385
00:17:47,945 --> 00:17:50,227
Gee, why wouldn't she want him back?

386
00:17:50,372 --> 00:17:53,909
And Michael and his son arrived at the cabin in the woods.

387
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:58,503
Looks like they have trucked off the bedrooms.

388
00:17:58,584 --> 00:18:02,455
Maybe we'll just set up some sleeping bags right here in the living room, huh?

389
00:18:02,553 --> 00:18:06,014
Lucille, meanwhile, heard a familiar sound.

390
00:18:06,895 --> 00:18:09,414
Oh, come on!

391
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:10,243
Mother?

392
00:18:10,371 --> 00:18:12,971
What the hell are you doing back there?

393
00:18:13,044 --> 00:18:16,459
I decided to sleep in the car, so my snoring wouldn't bother you,

394
00:18:16,664 --> 00:18:20,329
and I left that recording of my snoring so you wouldn't know I'm gone.

395
00:18:20,754 --> 00:18:22,162
We're halfway to the cabin.

396
00:18:22,264 --> 00:18:24,563
I'm going to drop you by this light.

397
00:18:24,912 --> 00:18:26,382
Or I could come with you.

398
00:18:26,643 --> 00:18:30,028
That might be the exact shot in the arm our relationship needs.

399
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:33,944
Well, at least I'll have someone to talk to on the way up.

400
00:18:43,093 --> 00:18:44,348
This is fun, isn't it?

401
00:18:44,465 --> 00:18:47,184
This is just like when we used to live up in the attic.

402
00:18:47,266 --> 00:18:48,070
Yeah.

403
00:18:50,056 --> 00:18:52,815
Or, or we could go back to Reno.

404
00:18:52,929 --> 00:18:54,199
Go back to Reno?

405
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:56,319
You don't want to be here?

406
00:18:56,411 --> 00:19:00,399
I mean, you've been sleeping in the stair car just so we could spend time together.

407
00:19:00,584 --> 00:19:02,207
That's not totally true, though.

408
00:19:02,371 --> 00:19:04,361
I'm just in the middle of a problem right now.

409
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,272
Oh, yeah? Well, let's... let's talk about it.

410
00:19:06,364 --> 00:19:07,798
I can't talk about it with you.

411
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:08,950
Why not?

412
00:19:09,082 --> 00:19:11,367
It's just, it's about a girl, and you're not gonna like this.

413
00:19:11,454 --> 00:19:13,246
- Is it about Ann?
- No.

414
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:15,779
Oh. Then of course I'm going to like it.

415
00:19:15,887 --> 00:19:17,489
I, I, I like Ann.

416
00:19:17,628 --> 00:19:23,214
No. It... It's just, it's a problem without an answer.

417
00:19:23,326 --> 00:19:24,904
Well, every problem has an answer.

418
00:19:24,985 --> 00:19:29,160
You're probably just confused because you're going through all of this alone,

419
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:32,579
and that's exactly why we need to spend this time together.

420
00:19:33,212 --> 00:19:34,222
Yeah, I guess so.

421
00:19:34,309 --> 00:19:35,383
I know so.

422
00:19:35,482 --> 00:19:38,319
So, here's the plan. Tomorrow morning, we're gonna get up early.

423
00:19:38,426 --> 00:19:41,482
Before we tell the cops that Pop Up escaped from prison,

424
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,099
we're going to go down to the lake, we're gonna discuss your girl problem,

425
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:45,493
and it's going to be fun.

426
00:19:45,554 --> 00:19:47,170
Especially the part with the cops.

427
00:19:47,672 --> 00:19:51,775
All right? Whatever your problem is with the girl, we're going to figure it out.

428
00:19:51,831 --> 00:19:53,427
That's what this place is for.

429
00:19:54,043 --> 00:19:55,855
That, and cheating on Gangee.

430
00:19:56,162 --> 00:19:57,969
You know, I'm really glad you brought me here, Dad.

431
00:19:58,077 --> 00:19:59,736
Yeah, we needed this.

432
00:20:00,007 --> 00:20:02,987
And this time, I'm not gonna let the family drag me away.

433
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:07,968
And the next morning, Michael rose early to spend the day with his son...

434
00:20:08,511 --> 00:20:12,864
...only to find himself once again dragged away by his family.

435
00:20:14,277 --> 00:20:16,642
Dad! What the hell are you doing?

436
00:20:16,734 --> 00:20:21,424
Sorry, I can't let you let Oscar out of prison, or they'll come for me!

437
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:24,470
Hey, how do you like the cabin?

438
00:20:30,794 --> 00:20:33,165
On the next... Arrested Development...

439
00:20:33,247 --> 00:20:35,307
Lucille arrives at the cabin.

440
00:20:35,745 --> 00:20:37,983
( bleep ) me. There's no cabin.

441
00:20:41,102 --> 00:20:42,115
Mother?

442
00:20:42,311 --> 00:20:43,871
Oh, my God!

443
00:20:44,205 --> 00:20:46,959
You still doing breakfast burritos?

444
00:20:47,393 --> 00:20:49,963
Maeby finds someone to help her forget her cousin...

445
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:50,809
...being stood up.

446
00:20:50,895 --> 00:20:51,868
Yeah, me, too.

447
00:20:51,971 --> 00:20:52,804
...her cousin.

448
00:20:52,903 --> 00:20:54,001
Want to make out?

449
00:20:54,139 --> 00:20:55,426
Yeah, sure, why not?

450
00:20:56,348 --> 00:20:58,791
And Lindsay catches up with Tobias.

451
00:20:58,898 --> 00:21:00,843
Get your hands off my husband, Kitty!

452
00:21:02,145 --> 00:21:04,397
Did someone say "husband"?

453
00:21:06,384 --> 00:21:07,752
I want a divorce.

454
00:21:07,847 --> 00:21:10,392
And I would be thrilled to represent either one of you.

455
00:21:11,647 --> 00:21:13,799
That'll be, uh, $50.

456
