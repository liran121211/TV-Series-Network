1
00:00:00,666 --> 00:00:02,237
The Bluth's were desperate.

2
00:00:02,327 --> 00:00:03,446
I assume you've all seen this.

3
00:00:03,541 --> 00:00:05,612
The press had them all but finished.

4
00:00:05,706 --> 00:00:06,688
What, what is it?

5
00:00:06,767 --> 00:00:08,684
This isn't really going to work over the phone, Dad.

6
00:00:08,773 --> 00:00:11,310
Then get Bob Loblaw to hire to hire me another surrogate.

7
00:00:11,393 --> 00:00:12,280
That's kind of the point.

8
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:16,272
Mr. Loblaw no longer works for us, because someone wanted a boyfriend.

9
00:00:16,365 --> 00:00:17,869
Don't blame me.

10
00:00:17,962 --> 00:00:19,461
I was talking to Lindsay, actually,

11
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,485
but he was clearly turned off to the both of you.

12
00:00:21,582 --> 00:00:23,190
But now we're going to need a new lawyer.

13
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,247
And that is going to mean about a $100,000 retainer.

14
00:00:27,335 --> 00:00:30,790
If we want a chance of keeping this family going past the next few weeks,

15
00:00:30,876 --> 00:00:32,694
we're going to have to pull out all the stops.

16
00:00:33,279 --> 00:00:34,404
What am I talking about?

17
00:00:34,881 --> 00:00:37,825
I'm talking about all of you getting jobs.

18
00:00:37,928 --> 00:00:39,792
Now the best place to look for a job...

19
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,304
Who threw the tomato?

20
00:00:42,086 --> 00:00:44,369
Well, how the hell are we going to get 100 grand?

21
00:00:44,455 --> 00:00:46,410
Well, I know this isn't exactly what you're looking for,

22
00:00:46,488 --> 00:00:48,760
but Maeby was just accepted into private school.

23
00:00:48,852 --> 00:00:50,361
And I've sent the check in already.

24
00:00:50,459 --> 00:00:52,098
No, that's not what I'm looking for at all.

25
00:00:52,192 --> 00:00:54,794
Michael, it's the most prestigious private school in town.

26
00:00:54,877 --> 00:00:56,376
Oh, no, not the Milford Academy.

27
00:00:56,483 --> 00:01:01,586
Children were neither were to be seen nor heard at the school Buster had attended.

28
00:01:01,874 --> 00:01:05,556
It's the exact opposite. It's called "Openings."

29
00:01:05,655 --> 00:01:06,920
Oh, great. That sounds like another one

30
00:01:07,002 --> 00:01:10,538
of those gradeless, structureless, new age feel-gooderies.

31
00:01:10,635 --> 00:01:14,246
They teach self-expression and getting in touch with feelings, Michael.

32
00:01:14,345 --> 00:01:15,727
I mean, I know you don't have any.

33
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:17,381
The boy who couldn't cry.

34
00:01:17,484 --> 00:01:18,877
He's a robot!

35
00:01:19,671 --> 00:01:22,123
Michael can cry. He doesn't want to rust.

36
00:01:22,238 --> 00:01:25,189
Yes, he's like the steel man from The Wizard From Oz.

37
00:01:25,288 --> 00:01:26,124
Tin man?

38
00:01:26,224 --> 00:01:27,307
Is that what he's called?

39
00:01:27,412 --> 00:01:28,199
He knows.

40
00:01:28,293 --> 00:01:29,536
You know, Lindsay, since you already sent the check,

41
00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:30,667
this is how you're going to pay for it.

42
00:01:30,762 --> 00:01:32,201
You're gonna be in charge of the house from now on, okay?

43
00:01:32,282 --> 00:01:33,837
The cooking, the cleaning, all of it.

44
00:01:33,925 --> 00:01:35,977
You're going to put Lindsay in charge of the cooking?

45
00:01:36,062 --> 00:01:37,288
At least you'll lose weight.

46
00:01:37,382 --> 00:01:39,433
You know, Mom, I think the only time you ever cooked for us,

47
00:01:39,523 --> 00:01:41,364
was the morning Rosa's mom died.

48
00:01:41,448 --> 00:01:43,855
You gave us cereal in an ashtray.

49
00:01:43,951 --> 00:01:46,060
Gob, pal, how about you? Can you find some work?

50
00:01:46,163 --> 00:01:47,467
Oh, sure, Michael.

51
00:01:47,997 --> 00:01:50,054
As what, a waiter?

52
00:01:50,162 --> 00:01:52,145
Can I get you something, madam?

53
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,462
I will have a vodka, though.

54
00:01:57,559 --> 00:01:58,180
What? Oh.

55
00:01:58,292 --> 00:02:00,362
You know, if you'd ever accidentally worked a day in your life,

56
00:02:00,457 --> 00:02:02,284
you'd know that there's no indignity in it.

57
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,851
Great. She'll have a vodka.

58
00:02:03,952 --> 00:02:07,585
Instead of us all selling out and becoming housewives and waiters,

59
00:02:07,687 --> 00:02:08,898
why don't we have a big event?

60
00:02:08,992 --> 00:02:12,549
Some sort of "save our Bluths" type thing.

61
00:02:14,236 --> 00:02:17,453
We'll throw a legal defense fund dinner. Ask for donations.

62
00:02:17,564 --> 00:02:20,110
As long as we don't look desperate.

63
00:02:20,211 --> 00:02:22,918
We want them to think we'll take their help, but we don't need it.

64
00:02:23,004 --> 00:02:24,515
I should be seen a lot at the club.

65
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:26,998
Yeah, our backs are against the wall, it's just

66
00:02:27,085 --> 00:02:29,716
hard to accept that it's really come to begging.

67
00:02:29,812 --> 00:02:32,255
Some times it's the only way to stay in the game.

68
00:02:32,388 --> 00:02:34,848
Please tell your friends about this show.

69
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:45,384
Michael had asked Lindsay to take care of the house,

70
00:02:45,484 --> 00:02:46,787
and to his surprise...

71
00:02:46,902 --> 00:02:48,485
- You're sort of doing it.
- ...she was sort of doing it.

72
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,557
Yeah, check it out.

73
00:02:49,658 --> 00:02:52,473
I found that canned ham that we'd had forever,

74
00:02:52,571 --> 00:02:55,822
and I put it in a pot of boiling water, and guess what I'm calling it?

75
00:02:55,911 --> 00:02:56,603
Soup?

76
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:57,918
Hot ham water.

77
00:02:58,009 --> 00:03:00,394
You know, I'm actually a really good mom.

78
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:02,179
I think it's 'cause Maeby's never around.

79
00:03:02,281 --> 00:03:04,742
You should send George Michael to Openings, too.

80
00:03:04,837 --> 00:03:06,928
Yes, it could help him express his feelings.

81
00:03:07,026 --> 00:03:09,032
My son expresses himself just fine.

82
00:03:09,143 --> 00:03:10,143
Isn't that right, son?

83
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:12,284
What? Yeah... fine.

84
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,865
Uh, yes, I don't care.

85
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:14,811
What's up?

86
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,210
Yes, he's a regular Freddy Wilson, that one.

87
00:03:17,323 --> 00:03:18,765
I don't know that reference.

88
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,182
I don't either.

89
00:03:20,813 --> 00:03:22,819
I don't know either.

90
00:03:22,928 --> 00:03:24,369
It's this guy.

91
00:03:24,729 --> 00:03:27,284
My son's just fine where he is. And he's got the SAT's coming up.

92
00:03:27,366 --> 00:03:29,178
You got to do well on those. You studying upstairs?

93
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:31,923
Yeah, I'm just taking a three real quick, so I can get a cream soda.

94
00:03:32,016 --> 00:03:32,980
Oh, I'll get that for you.

95
00:03:33,076 --> 00:03:34,533
No, I will get it. I have to get it myself.

96
00:03:34,635 --> 00:03:35,576
Just, relax...

97
00:03:37,578 --> 00:03:38,514
...just check the stove.

98
00:03:40,671 --> 00:03:43,357
You know, Michael, if I may take off my acting pants for a moment

99
00:03:43,445 --> 00:03:46,210
and pull my analrapist stocking over my head,

100
00:03:46,311 --> 00:03:49,140
George Michael has been acting strange lately.

101
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:59,321
I think he may have developed what we in the soft sciences

102
00:03:59,395 --> 00:04:02,057
refer to obsessive-compulsive disorder.

103
00:04:02,155 --> 00:04:04,409
Or the O.C. disorder.

104
00:04:04,508 --> 00:04:05,061
Don't call it that.

105
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:08,765
I  think ultimately it's because he's afraid to express himself.

106
00:04:08,877 --> 00:04:10,551
Actually, it was because he was afraid

107
00:04:10,643 --> 00:04:13,522
his Aunt Lindsay was going to burn the house down.

108
00:04:13,627 --> 00:04:15,319
Hi, how are you?

109
00:04:20,321 --> 00:04:21,319
Cream soda.

110
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,770
Maybe he does need this school.

111
00:04:23,856 --> 00:04:25,103
Did you see this letter?

112
00:04:25,207 --> 00:04:27,075
You know, it's done wonders for Maeby.

113
00:04:27,173 --> 00:04:28,545
"Maeby is an exceptional young lady."

114
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:29,117
Exceptional.

115
00:04:29,234 --> 00:04:31,267
"We are sure that she is destined for great things..."

116
00:04:31,363 --> 00:04:32,185
Great things.

117
00:04:32,311 --> 00:04:34,980
"...and we wish her luck in all her..."

118
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:38,009
It says, "over."

119
00:04:38,121 --> 00:04:39,691
Probably have to crack this open to be sure,

120
00:04:39,775 --> 00:04:41,934
but this sounds like an expulsion letter.

121
00:04:42,023 --> 00:04:43,638
"She's never been to class."

122
00:04:43,735 --> 00:04:46,038
What kind of boarding school would lose track of its students?

123
00:04:46,128 --> 00:04:47,608
Openings is not a boarding school.

124
00:04:47,707 --> 00:04:49,526
I thought it was a boarding school, too.

125
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:53,324
Actually, Maeby had been on the set of a film called Snowboarding School 2,

126
00:04:53,415 --> 00:04:56,142
in her secret life as a film executive.

127
00:04:56,244 --> 00:04:58,440
There goes that non-refundable tuition.

128
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:00,515
You know, it is the one rule that they do have there.

129
00:05:00,609 --> 00:05:01,877
She should be punished for this.

130
00:05:01,998 --> 00:05:04,320
You know, Tobias, if I can become a more traditional mother,

131
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:05,988
than maybe you could start being more of a...

132
00:05:06,084 --> 00:05:08,473
Non-traditional mother. Yes, you're right.

133
00:05:08,595 --> 00:05:10,458
After all, I am her father.

134
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:13,176
Burners are still off and I re-washed all the clothes.

135
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:16,811
And that's when Michael decided that perhaps Maeby's tuition

136
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:19,251
didn't have to go to waste after all.

137
00:05:19,365 --> 00:05:23,328
Meanwhile, Lucille went to work soliciting for the Bluth fund-raiser.

138
00:05:23,417 --> 00:05:25,429
I mean, we have plenty of money, don't get me wrong.

139
00:05:25,536 --> 00:05:29,487
But we can't use our personal assets to defend the company.

140
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:32,781
Just then, Gob arrived and decided to have a laugh.

141
00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:34,765
Your drink, madam.

142
00:05:35,951 --> 00:05:38,259
- Can I get you anything?
- Get that one out of here.

143
00:05:38,402 --> 00:05:39,787
As you please.

144
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:42,885
But Lucille had never made eye contact with a waiter.

145
00:05:42,982 --> 00:05:44,330
Can you drop these off at two?

146
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,617
Why not.

147
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,571
I'm just a waiter.

148
00:05:47,997 --> 00:05:49,443
So he kept it up.

149
00:05:49,566 --> 00:05:52,006
We're all out of the halibut.

150
00:05:52,716 --> 00:05:54,255
The joke was over...

151
00:05:54,363 --> 00:05:56,744
but the lunch rush was just beginning.

152
00:05:56,809 --> 00:05:58,059
Hey, new guy, you want to seat table four?

153
00:05:58,153 --> 00:06:00,192
Back at the penthouse however...

154
00:06:00,292 --> 00:06:02,291
- My lunch is long overdue.
- ...lunch was long overdue.

155
00:06:02,411 --> 00:06:04,346
I don't suppose she left anything for me to eat?

156
00:06:04,438 --> 00:06:07,857
No, just the soup and a half sandwich and a whole sandwich for me.

157
00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:11,283
Hey, so what's going on with the fund-raiser?

158
00:06:11,382 --> 00:06:15,573
Well, I don't think the Home Builders Organization is going to be supporting us.

159
00:06:15,668 --> 00:06:18,149
Yeah, the HBO's not going to want us. What do we do now?

160
00:06:18,233 --> 00:06:19,894
Well, I think it's show time.

161
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:21,870
I think we have to have a show during dinner.

162
00:06:21,966 --> 00:06:23,767
Hey, we can have some celebrities in.

163
00:06:23,855 --> 00:06:26,839
You know, Oscar winners like Nicole Kidman...

164
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,533
I don't want to just round up a bunch of famous people that have nothing to do

165
00:06:28,627 --> 00:06:31,583
with our family as some sort of cheap stunt. What's that got to do with us?

166
00:06:31,659 --> 00:06:34,508
Nothing. But you're going to write a speech about me

167
00:06:34,587 --> 00:06:36,353
so they can see how wonderful I am.

168
00:06:36,436 --> 00:06:38,159
I think we've got a better chance at Nicole Kidman.

169
00:06:38,249 --> 00:06:41,064
Actually, I may have an in with Andy Richter.

170
00:06:41,175 --> 00:06:42,737
Do you think you can get him?

171
00:06:42,867 --> 00:06:44,380
I'm kidding. Of course, not him.

172
00:06:44,466 --> 00:06:47,504
His brother does teach George Michael at Openings.

173
00:06:47,609 --> 00:06:50,809
George Michael is going to that new age feel-goodery?

174
00:06:50,888 --> 00:06:51,825
I don't think that's a good idea.

175
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:53,723
They're going to poison him against you.

176
00:06:53,818 --> 00:06:56,385
Remember what happened when we sent Lindsay to that kind of school?

177
00:06:56,476 --> 00:06:59,213
All of a sudden I was the bad guy to her.

178
00:06:59,314 --> 00:07:02,095
And you don't respect Mom and you don't respect women.

179
00:07:04,072 --> 00:07:05,246
Are you married?

180
00:07:05,493 --> 00:07:06,681
Damn  school.

181
00:07:06,863 --> 00:07:10,692
I said to the teacher, I said, "You poison her, I'll poison you."

182
00:07:10,779 --> 00:07:13,413
George Sr. did more than just say it.

183
00:07:13,525 --> 00:07:16,113
He sent the man a basket of poisoned muffins.

184
00:07:16,206 --> 00:07:17,557
Do you know the Muffin Man?

185
00:07:17,658 --> 00:07:19,733
There's a reward in it if you do.

186
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,215
Then-- would you like some foam in your coffee?

187
00:07:22,312 --> 00:07:26,354
It's called a cuppakeno and wait till you see what it costs.

188
00:07:26,499 --> 00:07:29,204
You can say what you want about the Milford Academy--

189
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:33,254
the kids that came out of there, prepared for life.

190
00:07:33,345 --> 00:07:34,944
Does anyone know how to eat one of these?

191
00:07:35,045 --> 00:07:36,809
You know, George Michael's going to be just fine, okay?

192
00:07:36,905 --> 00:07:39,111
I just want him to know how to express himself.

193
00:07:39,446 --> 00:07:40,058
It doesn't do anything.

194
00:07:40,163 --> 00:07:43,052
He was actually having trouble expressing himself.

195
00:07:43,149 --> 00:07:44,855
Why don't you tell the group about yourself.

196
00:07:44,971 --> 00:07:46,933
My name is George Michael Bluth.

197
00:07:47,452 --> 00:07:50,580
I'm a 16-year-old Caucasian male.

198
00:07:50,951 --> 00:07:52,107
My mom died.

199
00:07:52,988 --> 00:07:54,361
And I guess that's it.

200
00:07:55,443 --> 00:07:56,388
Hardly.

201
00:07:56,513 --> 00:07:59,647
See, if it were me, I would say I'm Donny Richter.

202
00:07:59,742 --> 00:08:02,272
I have a brother named Andy. He's an attention hog.

203
00:08:02,367 --> 00:08:04,606
He can't seem to really attract a real audience,

204
00:08:04,703 --> 00:08:06,648
but I love the fat S.O.B. anyway.

205
00:08:06,751 --> 00:08:08,612
I thought you looked like that guy Andy Richter.

206
00:08:08,706 --> 00:08:09,957
You guys are identical twins?

207
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,962
Identical quintuplets, actually.

208
00:08:12,052 --> 00:08:15,248
There was Andy the showoff, Donny the sensitive one,

209
00:08:15,342 --> 00:08:19,214
Jerrifth the flirt, Rocky the risk-taker and Andy's stunt double

210
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,688
and Emmet who asked that we not show his picture.

211
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:26,691
Although, composite photography tells us he'd looks something like this.

212
00:08:26,794 --> 00:08:27,767
Here's what I want you to do.

213
00:08:27,894 --> 00:08:31,742
I want you to go home tonight and write something about how you really feel.

214
00:08:31,842 --> 00:08:32,967
Something critical.

215
00:08:33,067 --> 00:08:34,714
Bring it in tomorrow and read it for the group.

216
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,632
Will this go toward my grade?

217
00:08:37,098 --> 00:08:38,993
We don't have grades here.

218
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:41,885
A student either learns and gets an "L,"

219
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:44,161
or they fluctuate in their learning.

220
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,187
What  do we get for that?

221
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,272
An "F."

222
00:08:46,531 --> 00:08:47,457
Mr. F.

223
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,731
Maeby, meanwhile, was about to have a learning experience of her own.

224
00:08:50,829 --> 00:08:54,443
Well, well, I understand you've been having trouble with that expensive boarding school.

225
00:08:54,536 --> 00:08:56,091
That's right, I can read.

226
00:08:56,186 --> 00:08:59,645
Okay, first of all, Variety got it wrong, all right? We didn't even want this project.

227
00:08:59,733 --> 00:09:01,942
It was a co-finance with Miramax then, poof, Miramax is gone

228
00:09:01,971 --> 00:09:05,566
and we're still on the hook, and it turns out Jamie Kennedy can't even snowboard.

229
00:09:06,714 --> 00:09:08,468
All right, I'll listen to this later.

230
00:09:08,556 --> 00:09:11,408
And don't tell me where you've been. It'll just make me worry more.

231
00:09:11,503 --> 00:09:12,583
But guess what?

232
00:09:12,682 --> 00:09:14,378
There's a new daddy in town.

233
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:17,352
A discipline daddy.

234
00:09:20,245 --> 00:09:22,623
Oh, it's a... it's a parenting tape.

235
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,471
If you want to skip school, that's fine.

236
00:09:24,571 --> 00:09:25,875
You'll just come to work with me.

237
00:09:25,986 --> 00:09:27,578
But you don't have a job.

238
00:09:27,688 --> 00:09:30,300
All right, here, tell you what we're going to do...

239
00:09:30,414 --> 00:09:34,099
We are going to stuff each one of these gift bags with

240
00:09:34,197 --> 00:09:38,671
a head shot, some glitter, and a decorative hand soap.

241
00:09:38,774 --> 00:09:41,405
And we're going to send them to every casting director in town.

242
00:09:41,508 --> 00:09:43,801
And don't forget the funny notes.

243
00:09:43,969 --> 00:09:45,688
"I know where you live. Ha-ha."

244
00:09:45,787 --> 00:09:46,924
Casting directors hate this.

245
00:09:47,051 --> 00:09:48,503
They really do.

246
00:09:49,303 --> 00:09:50,950
The glitter queen struck again.

247
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:53,532
Never hire Tobias Funke.

248
00:09:53,637 --> 00:09:56,799
And back at the country club, something unusual had happened.

249
00:09:56,913 --> 00:09:58,734
Oh, I don't have any drugs for sale.

250
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:01,744
Unless... did you expect me to follow you to your car?

251
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,245
They're your tips.

252
00:10:03,362 --> 00:10:04,059
Tips?

253
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:08,396
And Gob realized he'd accidentally worked a day in his life.

254
00:10:09,335 --> 00:10:11,746
Lindsay, meanwhile, was being a mother

255
00:10:11,847 --> 00:10:13,889
when someone showed up who needed one.

256
00:10:13,976 --> 00:10:14,769
How'd you get here?

257
00:10:14,868 --> 00:10:18,754
I walked. I tried hitchhiking, but it's hard to do without a thumb.

258
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:19,963
I'm so hungry.

259
00:10:20,081 --> 00:10:23,167
Would you like to try some of this?

260
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,132
It's so watery.

261
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:29,220
And yet there's a smack of ham to it.

262
00:10:29,336 --> 00:10:31,366
It's hot ham water.

263
00:10:31,469 --> 00:10:34,996
Upstairs, George Michael was struggling with his assignment.

264
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:37,653
Can you think of anything critical to say about my dad?

265
00:10:37,761 --> 00:10:38,885
Are you serious?

266
00:10:39,007 --> 00:10:42,331
I have glitter in my lungs from making goody bags for casting directors.

267
00:10:42,423 --> 00:10:44,394
And he's giving me 100 more to do for homework.

268
00:10:44,497 --> 00:10:47,889
It's like I don't do my homework, George Michael does my homework.

269
00:10:48,107 --> 00:10:51,224
And that's when he decided it was time to cheat off of her.

270
00:10:51,325 --> 00:10:53,456
You know it might help if you expressed yourself.

271
00:10:53,677 --> 00:10:57,752
It also gave him an opportunity to smell her neck.

272
00:10:57,931 --> 00:11:00,060
And the next day, Michael drove to Openings

273
00:11:00,143 --> 00:11:03,395
in the hopes of recruiting Donny's brother for the fundraiser

274
00:11:03,506 --> 00:11:06,955
when he noticed his son expressing himself rather well.

275
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:10,990
He pretends he's the great father all of a sudden and acts like he's all worried about me,

276
00:11:11,114 --> 00:11:14,798
but it turns out he just does it so I can help him with his joke of a career.

277
00:11:14,917 --> 00:11:16,975
No wonder Mom wanted out so bad.

278
00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:19,095
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

279
00:11:20,505 --> 00:11:24,532
Gob, meanwhile, was several days into being an accidental waiter.

280
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,135
And he discovered that a little flirting helped bring in the tips.

281
00:11:28,236 --> 00:11:31,678
If you didn't have adult onset diabetes, I wouldn't mind giving you a little suger.

282
00:11:31,786 --> 00:11:37,047
Oh, Gob... you could charm the black off a telegram boy.

283
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:40,088
Okay, we'll just tell you now. She's the one who dies.

284
00:11:40,213 --> 00:11:42,250
His name is Andy something.

285
00:11:42,348 --> 00:11:45,829
I think he's Ed McMahon's kid, a song and dance man.

286
00:11:45,936 --> 00:11:49,251
Lucille, meanwhile, was there soliciting for the fundraiser,

287
00:11:49,362 --> 00:11:51,108
but still hadn't noticed him...

288
00:11:51,221 --> 00:11:52,535
We'll have the lobster tail.

289
00:11:52,643 --> 00:11:53,768
...until this happened.

290
00:11:53,871 --> 00:11:57,911
And maybe later you can save a little piece of tail for me.

291
00:11:59,004 --> 00:12:00,128
Come on!

292
00:12:00,861 --> 00:12:04,868
I hope that isn't the sort of humor Andy McMahon will be doing.

293
00:12:04,993 --> 00:12:06,059
Lobster,  ma'am?

294
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,278
And Michael went to confront Donny.

295
00:12:08,381 --> 00:12:11,860
Hey, nice haircut. And thanks for turning my son against me.

296
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,239
Oh, oh, no, no, I'm Andy.

297
00:12:14,331 --> 00:12:15,137
Oh.

298
00:12:15,767 --> 00:12:16,493
Sorry.

299
00:12:16,608 --> 00:12:17,406
Oh, hey.

300
00:12:17,512 --> 00:12:19,763
How'd you feel about coming to a fundraiser at our house?

301
00:12:19,883 --> 00:12:21,283
How much does it pay?

302
00:12:21,403 --> 00:12:23,342
- It's just a free dinner...
- I'll be there.

303
00:12:23,439 --> 00:12:24,155
Great.

304
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,758
I'll be in the cafeteria.

305
00:12:25,935 --> 00:12:27,689
Ugh, he's such a pig.

306
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:30,283
You should know about bad mouthing family members.

307
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,600
I  heard what you had my son say out there.

308
00:12:32,744 --> 00:12:34,495
He chose what to say.

309
00:12:34,595 --> 00:12:36,551
Maybe we should include him in this.

310
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:38,689
No need. You're the one that poisoned him against me.

311
00:12:38,795 --> 00:12:40,245
How would you like that done to you?

312
00:12:40,358 --> 00:12:43,153
Are you threatening to poison me?

313
00:12:43,266 --> 00:12:46,577
I'm just expressing myself, man.

314
00:12:49,306 --> 00:12:50,539
What did I tell you?

315
00:12:50,635 --> 00:12:52,471
How dare that Donny Richter.

316
00:12:52,575 --> 00:12:55,003
You know, you got to take care of that guy or I will.

317
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:56,448
Yeah, yeah, let me.

318
00:12:56,555 --> 00:12:58,340
This is not your business, no.

319
00:12:58,457 --> 00:12:59,671
I'm just going to pull him out of that school.

320
00:12:59,782 --> 00:13:02,707
You're damn right you are. We can't have this happen, not now.

321
00:13:02,786 --> 00:13:05,749
This family has got to stick together.

322
00:13:05,856 --> 00:13:07,759
I don't want Gob coming to this dinner.

323
00:13:07,855 --> 00:13:08,624
Good idea.

324
00:13:08,756 --> 00:13:10,330
Guess where he's been getting his money.

325
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:12,251
Is he following people to their cars again?

326
00:13:12,349 --> 00:13:13,866
He's a waiter!

327
00:13:13,991 --> 00:13:15,691
He is? Well, that's great.

328
00:13:15,787 --> 00:13:17,232
No, it's not great.

329
00:13:17,332 --> 00:13:19,174
Well, am I the only one that thinks that this family

330
00:13:19,258 --> 00:13:21,302
is finally starting to become sympathetic and relatable?

331
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,562
I mean, that's what people want to see.

332
00:13:22,651 --> 00:13:24,605
Lindsay's taking care of the house.

333
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:26,662
Oh, I forgot about that.

334
00:13:26,754 --> 00:13:29,951
Tell the "housewife" she's not coming either.

335
00:13:30,217 --> 00:13:31,800
If you don't want her, you don't want me either.

336
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,493
She's taking care of me.

337
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:36,342
She glued my thumb back on.

338
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:37,950
Sister's my new mother, Mother.

339
00:13:38,043 --> 00:13:39,804
And is it just me, or is she looking hotter, too?

340
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,600
- Well, why don't you marry her?
- Maybe I will!

341
00:13:41,712 --> 00:13:43,625
We're veering away from relatability again.

342
00:13:44,578 --> 00:13:47,683
Meanwhile, Maeby was getting tired of being with her father.

343
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:50,803
Now what we do is we paint our lips Joan Crawford red,

344
00:13:50,902 --> 00:13:54,723
pop on a little blue eyeliner and then plant a lipstick kiss on every one of them.

345
00:13:54,825 --> 00:13:55,994
Why the blue eyeliner?

346
00:13:56,115 --> 00:13:58,729
Well, she felt that her eyes were too close together.

347
00:13:58,984 --> 00:13:59,750
Hello?

348
00:14:00,114 --> 00:14:01,361
Uh, y... uh...

349
00:14:01,454 --> 00:14:02,556
It's a casting director.

350
00:14:02,948 --> 00:14:04,525
Yes, he is available.

351
00:14:04,702 --> 00:14:10,114
Uh, let me put my, uh, our assistant on the phone with you. Thank you, yes.

352
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:11,424
I better get changed.

353
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:13,683
Thanks, Deb.

354
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:16,790
Yeah. So he's Tortured Victim #4, right?

355
00:14:16,901 --> 00:14:17,904
No, that's great.

356
00:14:18,174 --> 00:14:19,880
Yeah, he's really into discipline.

357
00:14:19,999 --> 00:14:22,550
And George Michael was about  to get some discipline, too.

358
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,071
You are no longer going to that school.

359
00:14:24,169 --> 00:14:25,964
I don't want to get into a big discussion about it.

360
00:14:26,055 --> 00:14:27,113
But it's just not right for you.

361
00:14:27,207 --> 00:14:28,550
Is this because I cheated off Maeby?

362
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:30,407
Because I've never done that before, Dad, I swear.

363
00:14:30,504 --> 00:14:32,004
I just couldn't think of anything to write about you,

364
00:14:32,111 --> 00:14:34,110
so I asked her to write it about her dad.

365
00:14:34,229 --> 00:14:35,449
You cheated?

366
00:14:35,895 --> 00:14:38,367
Yeah, it was stupid of me. Now Donny's met you.

367
00:14:38,481 --> 00:14:41,111
I mean, he's never going to believe that you were ever up for a part in Wicked.

368
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,224
Yeah, well, you know, you do what you have to do.

369
00:14:43,314 --> 00:14:45,181
You think I want to give that speech about Dad at the fundraiser?

370
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:47,323
Sometimes you say you hate your dad to get a good grade

371
00:14:47,425 --> 00:14:49,896
or you like him to make some money.

372
00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:51,580
Sounds like you're doing a great job over there.

373
00:14:51,676 --> 00:14:53,026
- We're keeping you in.
- No, I wasn't...

374
00:14:53,134 --> 00:14:54,863
Said I don't want to have a whole discussion about it.

375
00:14:54,968 --> 00:14:56,332
Donny... Oh.

376
00:14:57,475 --> 00:14:59,906
I guess I owe you an apology...

377
00:15:02,391 --> 00:15:03,809
It's Andy again, isn't it?

378
00:15:03,928 --> 00:15:04,707
Rocky.

379
00:15:04,815 --> 00:15:05,980
Andy's the pig.

380
00:15:06,087 --> 00:15:06,966
Well, you're not exactly...

381
00:15:07,077 --> 00:15:09,733
I'm his stunt double. You think I like this?

382
00:15:09,836 --> 00:15:11,030
I disgust myself.

383
00:15:11,138 --> 00:15:12,327
Let go of my dad, you're going to hurt him.

384
00:15:12,426 --> 00:15:14,910
Oh, no, I'm only making it look like that.

385
00:15:15,033 --> 00:15:17,417
He's totally in charge of the situation.

386
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:23,251
So what is the problem?

387
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,917
Somebody sent my brother Donny a basket of poison muffins.

388
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,191
It could've been the Muffin Man. They never caught him.

389
00:15:30,318 --> 00:15:31,372
How do you know about that?

390
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:33,856
I saw it on Why We Were Scared of the '70s.

391
00:15:33,969 --> 00:15:36,647
And whatever happened to the Muffin Man? Remember him?

392
00:15:36,744 --> 00:15:39,197
I always pictured a giant six-foot muffin

393
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:41,685
trying to eat me while I was eating him.

394
00:15:41,836 --> 00:15:43,871
It's kind of a fantasy I go to a lot now.

395
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:46,956
And he says you threatened to poison him.

396
00:15:47,074 --> 00:15:51,264
I was upset. I'd just heard that my son thought I was a horrible father.

397
00:15:51,374 --> 00:15:53,009
But, no, I didn't poison him.

398
00:15:53,175 --> 00:15:55,103
Well, if I find out you did...

399
00:15:56,376 --> 00:16:00,108
Oh, Andy wants to know, at this dinner, you want him to sing or anything?

400
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,609
A song would be fantastic.

401
00:16:03,297 --> 00:16:06,255
So, Dad, you saw that? I thought you didn't know what I said about you.

402
00:16:06,361 --> 00:16:08,531
Well, that wasn't exactly the truth.

403
00:16:08,622 --> 00:16:10,910
But don't worry, I know you don't have anything bad to say about me.

404
00:16:11,024 --> 00:16:12,604
Well, no, you know what? I think Donny was right.

405
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,316
I just wasn't digging deep enough.

406
00:16:14,419 --> 00:16:17,099
I think I might've meant what I said. You never listen to me.

407
00:16:17,206 --> 00:16:20,645
You didn't ask me if I wanted to go to the school, you didn't ask me about what I said.

408
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:23,478
You threatened my teacher. You don't respect me.

409
00:16:23,618 --> 00:16:25,143
How can I respect you, man?

410
00:16:26,439 --> 00:16:30,077
It was a complex situation without an easy solution.

411
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:30,844
Hello?

412
00:16:30,934 --> 00:16:33,573
The caterers didn't show up. I used the club.

413
00:16:33,675 --> 00:16:35,364
They said we owe them too much money.

414
00:16:35,468 --> 00:16:36,868
I guess all those lunches...

415
00:16:36,994 --> 00:16:41,175
I've got 50 people coming in three hours and nothing to feed them.

416
00:16:41,286 --> 00:16:42,421
No one to serve it.

417
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:45,524
We have to make a good impression or we're finished.

418
00:16:45,632 --> 00:16:49,274
Now that's a clear cut situation with a promise of comedy.

419
00:16:49,438 --> 00:16:50,555
Tell your friends.

420
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:57,013
The Save Our Bluths Party was starting to heat up.

421
00:17:03,513 --> 00:17:06,107
But the same could not be said for Lindsay's chicken.

422
00:17:06,201 --> 00:17:07,881
What is going on? They're getting restless.

423
00:17:07,979 --> 00:17:09,762
I can't offer to ( bleep ) him in front of their husbands.

424
00:17:09,854 --> 00:17:11,210
This is what you're making?

425
00:17:11,326 --> 00:17:12,493
Poached salmonella?

426
00:17:12,584 --> 00:17:13,589
It'll be fine.

427
00:17:13,712 --> 00:17:15,195
I'll just put the sauce on them.

428
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,742
What kind of sauce is that?

429
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:19,146
Wait, this is the water I thawed the chicken in.

430
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,040
Oh. Well, that should go with chicken.

431
00:17:21,184 --> 00:17:22,083
Yeah.

432
00:17:22,191 --> 00:17:23,204
Fantastic.

433
00:17:23,398 --> 00:17:25,554
And some powerful players showed up.

434
00:17:25,658 --> 00:17:27,923
George, Bill Kinkaid from Phosco Industries.

435
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:28,749
Sort of.

436
00:17:28,849 --> 00:17:31,316
Hope you don't mind, I sent one of those stupid surrogates.

437
00:17:31,421 --> 00:17:32,712
You got busted, too.

438
00:17:32,813 --> 00:17:34,414
No, I had a prior engagement.

439
00:17:34,524 --> 00:17:35,878
I'm at the Fire & Ice Ball.

440
00:17:35,997 --> 00:17:37,952
Coming through. Chicken in chicken sauce.

441
00:17:38,244 --> 00:17:39,908
Thank you very much for showing up.

442
00:17:40,405 --> 00:17:42,498
Maybe you could just sing while they're bringing out the dinners.

443
00:17:42,592 --> 00:17:45,051
Uh, I'm not Andy.

444
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,136
I'm Emmitt.

445
00:17:46,249 --> 00:17:50,121
Andy sent me over to let you know that he's not going to be able to make it tonight.

446
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,683
Michael was suspicious.

447
00:17:51,787 --> 00:17:53,003
I mean, think about it--

448
00:17:53,124 --> 00:17:55,393
We can't show Emmitt without blurring him.

449
00:17:55,509 --> 00:17:59,173
Yeah, he's... singing at the Fire & Ice Ball tonight.

450
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:02,089
Andy Richter is singing at the Fire & Ice Ball?

451
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:06,610
I should send Andy a little basket of poison muffins, too.

452
00:18:06,815 --> 00:18:07,787
Muffins?

453
00:18:08,407 --> 00:18:09,928
Oh, my God, Dad.

454
00:18:10,098 --> 00:18:11,819
You're the Muffin Man?

455
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:14,638
You poisoned 25 teachers during the '70s?

456
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,785
Just the first two. The others were copycats.

457
00:18:16,885 --> 00:18:18,298
You poisoned Donny, didn't you?

458
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:19,798
We're losing them. Come on, come on.

459
00:18:20,326 --> 00:18:25,535
Have your attention. My son would like to say just a couple of words about me.

460
00:18:25,645 --> 00:18:28,216
And that's when Michael noticed his own son.

461
00:18:29,013 --> 00:18:29,982
You came, huh?

462
00:18:30,093 --> 00:18:33,262
Yeah, well, it was wrong of me to say what I did about how I felt.

463
00:18:33,787 --> 00:18:34,914
No, you said what you felt.

464
00:18:35,012 --> 00:18:36,894
And maybe it's about time I did the same thing.

465
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:41,082
So why don't we just let him express himself. Go ahead, son.

466
00:18:41,216 --> 00:18:46,451
Um, I was going to say that you don't know who my father really is

467
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:50,214
and that what has happened to us is a great injustice,

468
00:18:50,321 --> 00:18:53,306
that we were never really given a fair chance.

469
00:18:53,478 --> 00:18:55,067
But that's not the truth.

470
00:18:56,204 --> 00:18:57,981
We've been given plenty of chances.

471
00:18:58,102 --> 00:19:03,242
And maybe the Bluths just aren't worth saving, maybe we're not that likable, you know.

472
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:04,649
We're very self-centered.

473
00:19:04,763 --> 00:19:07,239
And my father may be the worst of us.

474
00:19:07,343 --> 00:19:12,703
Me, too. You know, I seem to... I threaten people who I don't feel support me.

475
00:19:12,822 --> 00:19:14,097
He poisons them.

476
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,681
Anyway, here's my advice to you.

477
00:19:16,783 --> 00:19:20,211
Go ahead and take yourself a goody bag and get out of here while you can.

478
00:19:22,645 --> 00:19:25,756
The speech was disturbing, the food inedible

479
00:19:25,856 --> 00:19:28,416
and the gift bags... pretty frightening.

480
00:19:28,539 --> 00:19:31,191
And when Gob realized he wouldn't get tipped...

481
00:19:31,259 --> 00:19:32,870
Wait, no, no! Where's everyone going?

482
00:19:32,996 --> 00:19:34,433
...the service got a little worse.

483
00:19:34,554 --> 00:19:36,450
No one's leaving until I get my money!

484
00:19:36,587 --> 00:19:38,145
I'll follow you to your cars!

485
00:19:38,222 --> 00:19:41,601
Oh, and then that old racist woman choked on Buster's thumb.

486
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:42,882
My thumb!

487
00:19:42,996 --> 00:19:46,916
All in all, it was one of the Bluth's better dinner parties.

488
00:19:48,684 --> 00:19:50,164
Hey, what'd you think of the speech?

489
00:19:50,379 --> 00:19:51,927
You'd do great at Openings.

490
00:19:52,613 --> 00:19:55,349
You know, pal, you do not have to go there.

491
00:19:55,443 --> 00:19:56,833
I've just been very worried about your behavior.

492
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:00,877
You know, you're always turning off burners and irons and

493
00:20:00,995 --> 00:20:04,236
it may be OCD.

494
00:20:04,524 --> 00:20:08,507
OCD? No, I'm just cleaning up after Aunt Lindsay. She never turns things off.

495
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:09,577
Well...

496
00:20:09,964 --> 00:20:12,425
Guess that explains why I saw the hedge trimmer zipping around the drive way.

497
00:20:12,513 --> 00:20:14,893
I did it again, didn't I? I'm so self-centered.

498
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:18,105
From now on, I want you to just tell me what's on your mind, okay?

499
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,988
And I promise I won't just hear what I want to hear. Okay?

500
00:20:25,567 --> 00:20:27,344
- I love my cousin.
- Love you, too, pal.

501
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:33,489
On the next... Arreted Development

502
00:20:33,825 --> 00:20:36,511
The Bluth family gets some good news.

503
00:20:36,634 --> 00:20:38,794
They're all sending in donations.

504
00:20:38,897 --> 00:20:40,268
And you know what key was?

505
00:20:40,381 --> 00:20:41,330
Your speech.

506
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,925
It didn't sound desperate.

507
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,859
Well, I guess it really doesn't pay to be desperate.

508
00:20:46,282 --> 00:20:48,158
It sure doesn't.

509
00:20:48,381 --> 00:20:50,044
And... cut!

510
00:20:53,404 --> 00:20:55,760
Let's not celebrate yet. We still got the west coast feed, guys.
