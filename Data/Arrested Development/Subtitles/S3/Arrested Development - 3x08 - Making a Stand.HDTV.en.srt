1
00:00:00,517 --> 00:00:03,461
Now the story of a wealthy family who lost everything

2
00:00:03,544 --> 00:00:07,200
and the one son who had no choice but to keep them all together.

3
00:00:13,131 --> 00:00:14,990
It's Arrested Development...

4
00:00:18,078 --> 00:00:23,155
Michael was trying to include his brother in the business at his father's request.

5
00:00:23,595 --> 00:00:26,868
So, the last couple of months have seen us hemorrhaging money.

6
00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:31,131
But he was finding himself overwhelmed by the change.

7
00:00:31,223 --> 00:00:33,181
Is it my turn to speak yet? I've got a good one.

8
00:00:33,263 --> 00:00:34,846
We're gonna wait till after lunch for the tricks.

9
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:36,252
That's not a trick, Michael.

10
00:00:36,395 --> 00:00:38,362
It's a business opportunity.

11
00:00:39,741 --> 00:00:41,960
Okay, you can turn the music off. I already shot my wad.

12
00:00:42,462 --> 00:00:43,261
Off.

13
00:00:43,784 --> 00:00:44,997
No, that's tape.

14
00:00:48,005 --> 00:00:52,870
I have got a quick way for us to literally be showered with money.

15
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,905
That's where the penny thing with the...

16
00:00:58,510 --> 00:00:59,347
Bonus.

17
00:00:59,446 --> 00:01:03,668
Anyway, it involves us making some money with our Mexican friends from Colombia.

18
00:01:03,766 --> 00:01:05,602
I think they're called Colombians.

19
00:01:05,688 --> 00:01:08,784
Oh, I forgot, we're being politically correct now.

20
00:01:10,076 --> 00:01:13,406
Anyway, there's a company there that wants to develop some time-shares with us.

21
00:01:13,446 --> 00:01:17,413
I told them that we'll sell them our blueprints for 100 grand!

22
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:20,537
Gob, we're prohibited from doing any business outside the country

23
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,965
while we're under investigation.

24
00:01:22,045 --> 00:01:23,944
Translation: Wish I'd thought of that.

25
00:01:24,023 --> 00:01:25,496
Nice translating, Dad.

26
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:28,520
Oh, also had this slogan made up.

27
00:01:28,613 --> 00:01:32,101
"A Colombian cartel that won't kidnap and kill you."

28
00:01:32,197 --> 00:01:34,921
I underlined "won't," 'cause it makes the competition look like...

29
00:01:34,997 --> 00:01:36,374
I'm serious: we're not doing it.

30
00:01:36,424 --> 00:01:40,088
It's illegal, and, uh, it's also kind of a stupid way to make a quick buck.

31
00:01:40,186 --> 00:01:42,189
It's not stupid. You're stupid.

32
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,170
Nice pout, Dad.

33
00:01:43,304 --> 00:01:45,945
I wasn't calling you stupid. I was calling the idea stupid.

34
00:01:46,044 --> 00:01:48,278
And if you'd spend a little bit more time learning about the business

35
00:01:48,365 --> 00:01:50,467
and less time with tricks, you'd know that.

36
00:01:50,589 --> 00:01:52,949
If I didn't have a live dove in my pants right now,

37
00:01:53,038 --> 00:01:55,711
I would leap across this table and... you know what? Forget it.

38
00:01:56,845 --> 00:01:58,033
Let's go ahead and take five.

39
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,779
Michael was frustrated

40
00:02:00,144 --> 00:02:03,061
and returned to his office to find Lindsay.

41
00:02:03,151 --> 00:02:04,324
Boy, Gob is driving me crazy.

42
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:07,653
I finally got rid of him for a little while, and Dad put him right back in the business.

43
00:02:07,771 --> 00:02:09,302
You two have always fought.

44
00:02:09,398 --> 00:02:10,873
I think I even have video of that.

45
00:02:10,975 --> 00:02:12,351
You and half of Orange County.

46
00:02:12,443 --> 00:02:16,682
As children, George Sr. would often provoke the boys to fight one another.

47
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,251
He's calling you a liar.

48
00:02:18,412 --> 00:02:20,482
I don't want your cards, Michael!

49
00:02:20,566 --> 00:02:23,219
He believed it created a competitive spirit,

50
00:02:23,302 --> 00:02:26,015
which equipped them for the challenges of life.

51
00:02:26,097 --> 00:02:27,172
Let's keep it in frame.

52
00:02:27,257 --> 00:02:30,634
He also believed footage of the tussles would be a big hit

53
00:02:30,726 --> 00:02:33,164
in the burgeoning home video market.

54
00:02:33,547 --> 00:02:37,106
He soon franchised the concept with such titles as:

55
00:02:37,195 --> 00:02:38,876
Boyfights 2,

56
00:02:40,669 --> 00:02:42,694
A Boyfights Cookout,

57
00:02:43,148 --> 00:02:47,570
and Backseat Boyfights: The Trip to Uncle Jack's 70th.

58
00:02:47,663 --> 00:02:48,973
How do you think I feel?

59
00:02:49,076 --> 00:02:50,209
You weren't even in the tapes.

60
00:02:50,305 --> 00:02:52,252
Uh, no, I was talking about my marriage.

61
00:02:52,346 --> 00:02:53,777
Are we still talking about the tapes?

62
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:55,657
Apparently not. What's going on with your marriage?

63
00:02:55,746 --> 00:03:00,118
Well, as you know, Bob Loblaw and I have had a secret little thing going.

64
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:02,112
Very secret. He doesn't even know, does he?

65
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:04,037
He has not known of it. That's correct.

66
00:03:04,124 --> 00:03:08,136
But, last night, he finally responded to one of my little hints.

67
00:03:08,235 --> 00:03:09,713
Why won't you ( bleep ) me?!

68
00:03:09,801 --> 00:03:11,137
Look, I'm not blind.

69
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:13,997
You're an attractive woman, and you've been dressing like a common whore.

70
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:15,288
Well, I've been trying.

71
00:03:15,376 --> 00:03:17,850
But you asked me to represent you in your divorce.

72
00:03:17,938 --> 00:03:19,360
I can't see a client.

73
00:03:19,462 --> 00:03:21,324
Well, then recommend somebody else.

74
00:03:21,413 --> 00:03:25,111
Well, our copy boy's very striking, but he often has toner on his fingers.

75
00:03:25,202 --> 00:03:26,757
I meant another lawyer.

76
00:03:27,351 --> 00:03:31,726
So now, I have to tell Tobias we're getting divorced, you know, break the news to Maeby,

77
00:03:31,802 --> 00:03:34,307
plus fit an eyebrow pluck in there all before the weekend.

78
00:03:34,392 --> 00:03:36,958
Perhaps you can talk to Maeby while you're getting your eyebrows plucked.

79
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:39,550
It'll look like your eyes are watering 'cause you're sad.

80
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:43,296
Later that day, Michael went to his parents apartment to talk

81
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:46,057
about the problem he was having with Gob.

82
00:03:46,623 --> 00:03:47,298
What's going on here?

83
00:03:47,374 --> 00:03:51,089
Well, they're painting the whole building, so I'm having the inside done, too.

84
00:03:51,173 --> 00:03:53,410
And that goes into storage, right?

85
00:03:53,496 --> 00:03:55,156
Not into your apartment.

86
00:03:55,683 --> 00:03:56,501
Que?

87
00:03:56,822 --> 00:03:59,228
What's Spanish for "I know you speak English"?

88
00:03:59,321 --> 00:04:01,205
Mom, if you're gonna speak to these guys like this,

89
00:04:01,292 --> 00:04:02,862
you might want to sleep with one eye open.

90
00:04:02,971 --> 00:04:05,260
Actually, I'll be sleeping at your place.

91
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,823
Paint fumes are deadly.

92
00:04:08,077 --> 00:04:09,619
You know Dad's under house arrest here?

93
00:04:09,703 --> 00:04:11,773
It'll be nice to get a break from him, too.

94
00:04:11,863 --> 00:04:15,156
Besides, I certainly can't recuperate here.

95
00:04:15,264 --> 00:04:16,259
Recuperate?

96
00:04:16,636 --> 00:04:18,160
I didn't want to worry anyone.

97
00:04:18,248 --> 00:04:21,630
It's a routine procedure, very common for women my age.

98
00:04:21,721 --> 00:04:24,449
I see, the apartment's not the only thing getting a face-lift.

99
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:27,590
Hope you kept your punch card, you're about due for a free one.

100
00:04:27,869 --> 00:04:31,646
No,  no, no, you're not getting a centavo until you finish all the work.

101
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,897
You guys are both gonna be sleeping with your eyes open.

102
00:04:34,157 --> 00:04:35,645
Mom, however, will not have a choice.

103
00:04:35,722 --> 00:04:37,692
Dad, need you to help me get rid of Gob.

104
00:04:37,775 --> 00:04:39,875
That ship sailed 35 years ago.

105
00:04:39,966 --> 00:04:41,155
Doesn't know anything about the business.

106
00:04:41,235 --> 00:04:44,397
Today, he suggested that we do an illegal Colombian deal.

107
00:04:44,538 --> 00:04:46,347
You said that was legal.

108
00:04:46,437 --> 00:04:47,678
That was your idea?

109
00:04:47,772 --> 00:04:49,688
I may have mentioned it.

110
00:04:49,774 --> 00:04:51,749
You  told Gob to do it, didn't you?

111
00:04:51,828 --> 00:04:54,096
Did you just want to get us at each other's throats again like you used to do

112
00:04:54,173 --> 00:04:55,847
with the Boyfights videos?

113
00:04:55,931 --> 00:04:56,742
Boyfights?

114
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:59,541
- Luchas del Muchachos. 
- Si, Luchas del Muchachos!

115
00:04:59,637 --> 00:05:00,995
- We had this video.
- Si!

116
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,761
The tapes were a big hit in Latin America.

117
00:05:03,854 --> 00:05:06,365
Don't look at me. I had nothing to do with them.

118
00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:08,833
Except for some of the Baby Buster shorts.

119
00:05:08,931 --> 00:05:10,231
Maybe I was trying to teach you something.

120
00:05:10,312 --> 00:05:12,221
Maybe I was trying to teach you how to compete.

121
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:15,719
I didn't do it with Buster and look how he turned out.

122
00:05:15,809 --> 00:05:17,123
He's Buster.

123
00:05:17,337 --> 00:05:18,389
Bebe Buster.

124
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:21,477
Yo quiero leche, yo quiero leche del madre.

125
00:05:21,586 --> 00:05:23,576
Even though I'm so old.

126
00:05:24,088 --> 00:05:26,688
Boy, those tapes made quite an impression on these three painters.

127
00:05:26,777 --> 00:05:28,757
I think I turned out pretty darned well, myself.

128
00:05:28,844 --> 00:05:30,389
Oh, you just turned out great.

129
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,525
I used my contacts to get you a job, and you quit!

130
00:05:34,682 --> 00:05:40,554
The job was at an Iraqi-owned toy store that was hoping to deter shoplifting.

131
00:05:40,638 --> 00:05:44,370
Okay, I'll just take off this cheap fake, huh?

132
00:05:44,825 --> 00:05:46,553
And we going to put on this sign.

133
00:05:47,512 --> 00:05:49,235
Beautiful. You like?

134
00:05:49,472 --> 00:05:51,394
They only wanted me because I had one hand.

135
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,425
And I won't do it!

136
00:05:52,521 --> 00:05:54,000
That's not the way Mother is raising me.

137
00:05:54,086 --> 00:05:56,494
Like I won't compete with my older brother anymore,

138
00:05:56,575 --> 00:05:59,046
despite the way Father raised me.

139
00:05:59,128 --> 00:06:00,010
We'll show you.

140
00:06:00,086 --> 00:06:03,038
Just like I showed Mr. al-Jibaaly Muhammed a-Abat.

141
00:06:03,173 --> 00:06:04,977
I stole the sign.

142
00:06:06,218 --> 00:06:08,540
Of course, I left my hand there, also.

143
00:06:10,005 --> 00:06:16,702
But FAO al-Jabaaly Muhammed a-Abat wasn't the only one having trouble scaring kids.

144
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:20,920
So was Hollywood's third youngest movie studio executive,

145
00:06:21,022 --> 00:06:22,191
Maeby Funke.

146
00:06:22,274 --> 00:06:24,557
The creature's in your imagination.

147
00:06:30,036 --> 00:06:31,346
That's a bloodsucker?

148
00:06:31,444 --> 00:06:32,659
It looks like Alf.

149
00:06:33,058 --> 00:06:34,216
You got a week to fix it.

150
00:06:34,303 --> 00:06:36,402
You must be the creature that ate our cat!

151
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,654
And Michael met up with Gob.

152
00:06:40,662 --> 00:06:43,830
Hey, Gob, why didn't you tell me that Colombian thing was Dad's idea?

153
00:06:43,912 --> 00:06:46,459
Well, Dad said not to, because you don't think I'm smart

154
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,054
and that I should take credit for it.

155
00:06:48,148 --> 00:06:50,534
Well, it was just Dad trying to turn us against each other again.

156
00:06:50,615 --> 00:06:52,802
And of course, I think you're smart, okay?

157
00:06:52,885 --> 00:06:54,701
Hey, what's going on down there? What are you doing?

158
00:06:54,779 --> 00:06:57,340
You don't want a hungry dove down your pants.

159
00:06:57,429 --> 00:06:59,266
That's how Tony Wonder lost a nut.

160
00:06:59,342 --> 00:07:02,672
Look, I know that I don't know about this housing stuff,

161
00:07:02,766 --> 00:07:05,112
but I've got this Christian girlfriend now,

162
00:07:05,196 --> 00:07:09,477
and she's trying to get me to be a better man and reconnect with my son.

163
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:12,498
And I'm trying to get her to renounce God and ( bleep ) me.

164
00:07:12,577 --> 00:07:16,439
And I just want to prove to her that I'm worth it.

165
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,155
Well, as always, Gob, a mixed bag there,

166
00:07:18,234 --> 00:07:21,511
but the middle part sounded pretty admirable for a second, so here's what I want to do.

167
00:07:21,592 --> 00:07:24,760
I want to get you your own banana stand franchise,

168
00:07:24,842 --> 00:07:26,661
and you can have Steve work at it.

169
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:27,793
You'd do that for me?

170
00:07:27,872 --> 00:07:30,214
Yes. Yeah, you can design your own shack...

171
00:07:30,313 --> 00:07:31,399
Choose my own location?

172
00:07:31,491 --> 00:07:33,890
Whatever you want. You're gonna be 100% in charge, all right?

173
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:38,386
But the most important thing is that we never let Dad turn us against each other again.

174
00:07:38,781 --> 00:07:39,893
Thanks, Michael.

175
00:07:46,093 --> 00:07:48,303
If you feel something moving down there, it's just the bird.

176
00:07:48,397 --> 00:07:49,413
I know it.

177
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,855
And a few days later, Michael got a call from his son.

178
00:07:56,942 --> 00:07:59,702
Hey Dad. Did you know Gob started a banana stand?

179
00:07:59,785 --> 00:08:02,455
Yeah,  that was my idea. I'm trying to get us to be less competitive.

180
00:08:02,533 --> 00:08:03,947
That's gonna be difficult.

181
00:08:06,301 --> 00:08:08,597
Plus, they have a very aggressive slogan.

182
00:08:13,913 --> 00:08:17,200
Gob had opened a new frozen banana stand, like,

183
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,503
20 feet from the old frozen banana stand.

184
00:08:20,595 --> 00:08:22,613
What's going on? You just thought you'd put the stand right here?

185
00:08:22,686 --> 00:08:23,609
Did the research.

186
00:08:23,687 --> 00:08:25,641
Did you know that more frozen bananas are sold here

187
00:08:25,725 --> 00:08:27,728
on this boardwalk than anywhere in the O.C.?

188
00:08:27,806 --> 00:08:28,364
Don't call it that.

189
00:08:28,452 --> 00:08:30,599
Also, gonna need a check, 'cause I went out of pocket on the new sign.

190
00:08:30,693 --> 00:08:33,439
Oh, and I need some bananas and some chocolate from the other branch.

191
00:08:33,517 --> 00:08:37,129
Just take the sign down. Take the whole booth down. You're cannibalizing our business.

192
00:08:37,201 --> 00:08:39,538
You're just scared of a little competish.

193
00:08:39,626 --> 00:08:41,819
You know, you guys don't even have bananas, so I'm not too worried.

194
00:08:41,902 --> 00:08:43,009
In fact, you know what?

195
00:08:43,141 --> 00:08:45,828
Me and my son are gonna kick your little shack's ass.

196
00:08:45,929 --> 00:08:48,165
Dad, it's okay. We can just work together with them.

197
00:08:48,254 --> 00:08:51,249
Dad, that makes sense. We don't really even know the recipe.

198
00:08:51,352 --> 00:08:53,976
There's no recipe, you just freeze a banana, then you stick it in the...

199
00:08:54,071 --> 00:08:55,578
Don't tell them! Stick it in the what?!

200
00:08:55,686 --> 00:08:57,235
It's okay, son. We'll figure it out!

201
00:08:57,337 --> 00:08:59,308
When we do, we'll have the last laugh.

202
00:08:59,401 --> 00:09:01,764
We'll be the laughingstock of the boardwalk.

203
00:09:03,704 --> 00:09:06,891
Meanwhile, Lindsay was preparing for her own competition.

204
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,280
This is Treat. He'll be representing you.

205
00:09:09,384 --> 00:09:12,256
He started off as my paralegal, but he's a lawyer now.

206
00:09:12,368 --> 00:09:13,741
As of next Monday.

207
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:14,965
Well, we'll fudge that.

208
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:16,995
Lindsay, just do me one favor.

209
00:09:17,071 --> 00:09:20,295
Don't mention me by name when you talk about your future plans for dating.

210
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:21,834
It reflects poorly on me.

211
00:09:22,005 --> 00:09:23,906
Right, right, the conflict of interest.

212
00:09:24,343 --> 00:09:25,459
Yeah, that, too.

213
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:28,254
Hello, Lindsay.

214
00:09:28,352 --> 00:09:30,287
Tobias. Did you get a lawyer?

215
00:09:30,396 --> 00:09:34,419
Only the best-looking and best educated lawyer in the whole O.C.

216
00:09:34,516 --> 00:09:35,841
- Don't call it that. 
- Okay.

217
00:09:35,926 --> 00:09:37,365
Bob Loblaw. How are you?

218
00:09:37,505 --> 00:09:39,077
Bob's representing you?

219
00:09:39,165 --> 00:09:40,287
He was.

220
00:09:40,503 --> 00:09:43,772
One day earlier, Tobias had spoken to him on the phone.

221
00:09:43,865 --> 00:09:45,971
...whether  or not those promises were made explicit.

222
00:09:46,065 --> 00:09:49,937
You want me to be explicit?

223
00:09:50,741 --> 00:09:54,251
Anyway, as it turns out, Bob was offering to be my lawyer.

224
00:09:55,945 --> 00:10:00,180
And that night, Buster arrived with a post-op Lucille.

225
00:10:00,282 --> 00:10:01,662
There she is.

226
00:10:03,714 --> 00:10:05,402
She wants to know where you want to put her.

227
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,604
She can take my room.

228
00:10:07,471 --> 00:10:09,527
She wants to know if I can sleep there, too.

229
00:10:10,853 --> 00:10:12,572
She said that's very important to her.

230
00:10:12,683 --> 00:10:14,420
All right, I'll meet you up there, Mother.

231
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:21,665
You better not lock it! I'll kick it in!

232
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:26,065
Oh, by the way, doctor said no kissing her on the face for one week.

233
00:10:26,455 --> 00:10:29,706
I was like, "Make it two weeks! See if I care!"

234
00:10:30,372 --> 00:10:31,579
Got a new hand?

235
00:10:31,721 --> 00:10:33,180
Oh, yeah, I'm trying it out.

236
00:10:33,274 --> 00:10:35,808
Guess who I ran into at the prosthetics shop while I was waiting for Mother.

237
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,376
Sorry, no refunds.

238
00:10:37,459 --> 00:10:41,267
And that's why you don't take your foot out of its wrapper.

239
00:10:41,359 --> 00:10:42,996
J. Walter Weatherman.

240
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:46,217
You're the man who used to scare us as children, and one time as an adult.

241
00:10:46,314 --> 00:10:51,466
George Sr. had always used him to teach his children lasting lessons.

242
00:10:51,655 --> 00:10:55,677
They usually involved his prosthetic arm being ripped off.

243
00:10:57,205 --> 00:11:01,810
And that's why you always leave a note.

244
00:11:01,908 --> 00:11:03,914
You one of George Bluth's kids?

245
00:11:04,109 --> 00:11:07,169
Hey... I guess you'll be scaring children yourself now.

246
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:08,537
As a matter of fact, I won't.

247
00:11:08,628 --> 00:11:13,354
If anything, it strengthened my resolve to be more than just a one-armed man.

248
00:11:13,462 --> 00:11:16,393
Even if it means me never taking a job again.

249
00:11:18,614 --> 00:11:19,986
A pulse makes him worth it.

250
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:21,002
Hello?

251
00:11:21,085 --> 00:11:24,707
Listen, I heard that you gave Gob a banana stand.

252
00:11:24,796 --> 00:11:27,545
They did great: he and Steve took in over $700.

253
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,446
They  did?

254
00:11:28,577 --> 00:11:29,365
Yeah.

255
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:31,900
So, I guess the Bluth Company's got a new heir.

256
00:11:31,994 --> 00:11:35,890
And that's when Michael realized it was time to get serious.

257
00:11:36,105 --> 00:11:37,296
George Michael?

258
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:39,131
You know where the banana suit is?

259
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:45,642
That night, Maeby, displaced by Buster, heard a noise.

260
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:48,938
Hello?

261
00:11:49,131 --> 00:11:50,077
George Michael?

262
00:11:51,403 --> 00:11:52,995
I'm thirsty.

263
00:11:53,938 --> 00:11:58,044
And Maeby knew she had found her blood-sucking creature.

264
00:11:59,289 --> 00:12:03,398
The next day, Michael took off work to man the banana stand

265
00:12:03,497 --> 00:12:05,814
while his son manned a banana.

266
00:12:05,901 --> 00:12:07,098
How you doing there, Champ?

267
00:12:07,195 --> 00:12:08,308
Is my name "Champ"?

268
00:12:08,444 --> 00:12:09,262
It's so hot...

269
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,447
Okay, why don't you take five.

270
00:12:10,549 --> 00:12:12,912
Not including the five minutes it takes to get out of this, right?

271
00:12:12,989 --> 00:12:14,717
- You're not getting out of it.
- Attention, everyone!

272
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,319
Why go to a banana stand when we can make your banana stand?

273
00:12:19,403 --> 00:12:22,576
I give you Barbara and Dee!

274
00:12:25,086 --> 00:12:28,384
Don't worry, these young beauties have been nowhere near the bananas.

275
00:12:28,505 --> 00:12:30,219
Dad, are they strippers?

276
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,197
If I know your uncle, they're at least strippers.

277
00:12:32,313 --> 00:12:33,641
Well, I guess we have to up the ante.

278
00:12:33,744 --> 00:12:37,357
You know, Dad, then they're just going to up it, and it'll go back and forth all day.

279
00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:39,367
If that's what it takes, that's what we're going to do.

280
00:12:39,488 --> 00:12:40,824
And they did.

281
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:44,911
But it was less entertaining than you might imagine--

282
00:12:45,143 --> 00:12:47,706
no matter what music was put under it.

283
00:13:03,987 --> 00:13:08,729
It was kind of funny to "Yellow Submarine," but who could afford it?

284
00:13:12,746 --> 00:13:14,689
So here's what happened at the end.

285
00:13:15,184 --> 00:13:17,011
Hey! Stop fighting! Stop!

286
00:13:17,138 --> 00:13:20,218
They're right, okay? This is insane. We're just "Boyfighting" again.

287
00:13:20,331 --> 00:13:21,294
And for what?

288
00:13:21,459 --> 00:13:23,420
A Hefty bagfull of pesos.

289
00:13:23,517 --> 00:13:24,919
You've been taking pesos?

290
00:13:25,415 --> 00:13:26,569
Well, dad said I should.

291
00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:28,066
Dad's involved with this?

292
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,485
Well, he chose the location.

293
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:30,819
And the strippers.

294
00:13:30,924 --> 00:13:32,805
And the sign. Every part of it, really.

295
00:13:32,906 --> 00:13:35,224
Wait a minute, don't you see what's happening here?

296
00:13:35,322 --> 00:13:37,068
Dad's clearly going ahead with the Colombian deal

297
00:13:37,145 --> 00:13:38,504
and he's just laundering it through your banana shack.

298
00:13:38,592 --> 00:13:40,779
He pitted us against each other so I'd be too busy to notice.

299
00:13:40,871 --> 00:13:43,234
Well, you know what? I think it's time for us to teach dad a lesson.

300
00:13:43,812 --> 00:13:46,453
Get the person who terrorized us the most in our childhood?

301
00:13:46,555 --> 00:13:47,723
She's still healing.

302
00:13:48,136 --> 00:13:50,093
Let's get J. Walter Weatherman.

303
00:13:55,694 --> 00:13:59,040
Michael and Gob had decided to teach their father a lesson.

304
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,671
So, we need the number of the one-armed man.

305
00:14:01,762 --> 00:14:03,072
I'm not giving you that.

306
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:05,321
You want to use his disability to scare someone.

307
00:14:05,419 --> 00:14:07,143
That's everything I'm against.

308
00:14:07,235 --> 00:14:08,931
Read the button, Mister!

309
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:16,657
"The only scary thing about a one-arm man trying to scare someone is the fact..."

310
00:14:16,734 --> 00:14:19,175
"...that he feels that his one arm is good for nothing but trying to scare somebody."

311
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:19,832
It's upside down.

312
00:14:19,921 --> 00:14:22,311
Well, let's see you try to put a button on with this.

313
00:14:22,467 --> 00:14:24,550
Stop screaming. It's not scary!

314
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,104
I'm going to get the number myself, okay?

315
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:28,120
Because we're not going to go through our lives being controlled by this guy.

316
00:14:28,198 --> 00:14:30,723
What is more pathetic than grown men being scared of their father?

317
00:14:30,821 --> 00:14:32,274
I'm thirsty.

318
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,856
This continued for a while,

319
00:14:37,516 --> 00:14:40,795
and later Michael and Gob went to put their plan in action.

320
00:14:40,885 --> 00:14:42,433
Well, I gave the Colombians back their money and I told them

321
00:14:42,518 --> 00:14:43,846
you had no right to make the deal.

322
00:14:43,936 --> 00:14:46,374
Have to warn you, though, they didn't sound too happy about it.

323
00:14:46,465 --> 00:14:49,215
Let's just hope they don't try to get even by trying to"cirsumventing" the law.

324
00:14:49,297 --> 00:14:50,653
What is that supposed to mean?

325
00:14:50,979 --> 00:14:52,806
Kidnap... or... Michael said...

326
00:14:52,891 --> 00:14:54,790
What, are you kidding? I have an ankle monitor.

327
00:14:54,883 --> 00:14:58,287
I can't even go into the hallway without the cops coming up. Stop it.

328
00:14:58,388 --> 00:14:59,396
So, clearly you know what you're doing.

329
00:14:59,488 --> 00:15:02,287
There's an off chance they might just want to take you, leave the ankle.

330
00:15:02,446 --> 00:15:03,997
But... anyhow.

331
00:15:04,914 --> 00:15:05,706
Stall him.

332
00:15:05,984 --> 00:15:08,674
And Michael went to solicit help for the lesson.

333
00:15:08,769 --> 00:15:12,505
How would you and some of your friends like to help us teach Mr. Bluth a lesson?

334
00:15:12,676 --> 00:15:14,620
Maybe pose as Colombians?

335
00:15:14,722 --> 00:15:17,038
But we are Guatemalan. Won't he know the difference?

336
00:15:17,132 --> 00:15:19,819
I think anything south of San Diego will be just fine.

337
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,419
Rolando was in The Groundlings.

338
00:15:21,511 --> 00:15:22,608
Just classes.

339
00:15:23,027 --> 00:15:25,307
Is it going to be unscripted like Curb?

340
00:15:26,355 --> 00:15:30,144
George Sr., meanwhile, had grown suspicious of his sons.

341
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:32,685
What was that with Michael just now?

342
00:15:33,411 --> 00:15:35,121
He wants to teach you a lesson.

343
00:15:35,287 --> 00:15:36,352
What kind of lesson?

344
00:15:36,453 --> 00:15:37,851
J. Walter Weatherman lesson.

345
00:15:37,939 --> 00:15:40,117
He's going to fake a kidnapping and helicopter ride to Colombia.

346
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:43,050
He's going to teach me a lesson using my own scare toy?

347
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:44,307
The  Weatherman wouldn't do it.

348
00:15:44,404 --> 00:15:45,515
I think Buster turned him.

349
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,050
Yeah, well, he'll say yes for me.

350
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:51,027
All right, we'll go along with his lesson-- but we're going to teach him one of our own.

351
00:15:51,154 --> 00:15:52,765
It's got to be a secret, okay?

352
00:15:52,858 --> 00:15:54,874
Between a dad and his...

353
00:15:55,411 --> 00:15:56,805
his favorite son.

354
00:16:00,027 --> 00:16:01,684
Don't worry, Pop.

355
00:16:01,803 --> 00:16:04,173
- Gob Bluth doesn't cave.
- Yeah, you just did for me.

356
00:16:04,281 --> 00:16:07,237
- Well, you asked me to, so I thought...
- Go. Go. Go. It's fine.

357
00:16:07,355 --> 00:16:10,401
And Lindsay and Tobias were back with the arbitrator.

358
00:16:10,486 --> 00:16:13,946
As you know, it is very difficult to establish fault in a divorce,

359
00:16:14,035 --> 00:16:15,933
but one indicator is fidelity.

360
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:19,550
Now, my client has not pursued sex outside of this marriage.

361
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:20,471
Nor in it.

362
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:21,602
I got this one.

363
00:16:21,709 --> 00:16:22,943
Can the same be said for you?

364
00:16:23,028 --> 00:16:26,150
Oh, absolutely-- I've done everything to make this marriage work.

365
00:16:26,252 --> 00:16:28,946
That's interesting. Can you tell me what your plans are for this evening?

366
00:16:29,104 --> 00:16:30,124
Uh...

367
00:16:30,372 --> 00:16:32,249
I have plans with a friend.

368
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,897
A man? What's his name, please?

369
00:16:33,989 --> 00:16:35,221
Don't answer that.

370
00:16:35,384 --> 00:16:36,666
I withdraw the question.

371
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,006
Why don't we stop for the day...

372
00:16:38,106 --> 00:16:43,194
so Mrs. Funke can get to her date with her mysterious Mister...

373
00:16:44,158 --> 00:16:45,154
Blah-Blah-Blah.

374
00:16:45,302 --> 00:16:47,483
At 8:30, unless you want to sit at the bar.

375
00:16:47,819 --> 00:16:51,003
- It was the first time someone took Tobias's side...
- Bob? Bob?

376
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:52,571
and he wanted to thank him.

377
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,395
Listen, uh... as much as I hate losing Lindsay and everything,

378
00:16:54,465 --> 00:16:56,602
I feel like I'm making a friend in you.

379
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,189
So, I was wondering if maybe tonight you just want to, uh...

380
00:16:59,276 --> 00:17:03,477
take in a movie, or a shvitz... or just stay in and nest.

381
00:17:03,562 --> 00:17:06,802
Actually, I was going to stay in my office tonight and work on my law blog.

382
00:17:06,889 --> 00:17:09,542
Of course-- the "Bob Loblaw Law Blog."

383
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,765
Wow. You, sir, are a mouthful!

384
00:17:12,844 --> 00:17:16,698
While Tobias was trying to get his mouth around Bob Loblaw,

385
00:17:16,961 --> 00:17:20,401
Maeby was showing Mort Myers a monster of her own.

386
00:17:20,492 --> 00:17:22,439
Ah! Oh, it's terrifying!

387
00:17:22,523 --> 00:17:24,273
Who did that for you, Industrial Light and Magic?

388
00:17:24,357 --> 00:17:25,987
Kopelson Plastic and Silicon.

389
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:27,589
Did he do Land of the Dead?

390
00:17:27,677 --> 00:17:29,774
Yeah, he's been in Beverly Hills for years.

391
00:17:29,866 --> 00:17:31,521
Let's get our makeup people on it.

392
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:36,726
And George Sr. waited for the fake kidnapping he knew Michael had orchestrated.

393
00:17:38,492 --> 00:17:39,706
Don't move!

394
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,678
Okay, well, let's do it.

395
00:17:41,797 --> 00:17:43,382
Get into the box, old man!

396
00:17:43,492 --> 00:17:46,925
Oh, a blanket, who thought of that? That is very nice.

397
00:17:47,026 --> 00:17:48,056
Come on. Get in the trunk!

398
00:17:48,176 --> 00:17:50,111
What about my ankle monitor?

399
00:17:50,228 --> 00:17:52,891
We have have an ankle monitor... deactivator.

400
00:17:53,009 --> 00:17:55,030
Oh, good. See? I've been meaning to get one of those.

401
00:17:55,103 --> 00:17:58,782
I'm not going to resist you guys, because, you know, I don't want you to beat me.

402
00:17:58,874 --> 00:18:02,999
But the mistreated painters were actually looking forward to that part.

403
00:18:03,108 --> 00:18:04,883
Oh, I forgot my iPod.

404
00:18:12,353 --> 00:18:13,941
Start the helicopter!

405
00:18:14,213 --> 00:18:18,883
And, so, Michael, believing himself to be aided by Gob, set to work.

406
00:18:20,023 --> 00:18:24,165
But, this, too, produced less-than-compelling footage.

407
00:18:32,639 --> 00:18:34,435
And this is how that ended.

408
00:18:34,526 --> 00:18:36,600
Put on the sound effects! Put on the sound effects!

409
00:18:37,129 --> 00:18:39,332
CD... CD one! CD one!

410
00:18:39,841 --> 00:18:41,663
Track two! Track two!

411
00:18:42,423 --> 00:18:44,529
Put the hostage here by the ottoman!

412
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,280
Get it out of here! What's it doing in here?!

413
00:18:46,379 --> 00:18:47,100
Ottoman out!

414
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:51,370
And George Sr. was released from his long journey into the living room.

415
00:18:51,412 --> 00:18:52,231
Where am I?

416
00:18:52,322 --> 00:18:53,852
Colombia, where do you think?

417
00:18:53,955 --> 00:18:58,340
And you just missed the last train that will come through the jungle for three days.

418
00:18:58,427 --> 00:19:00,027
He's good. He was a Groundling.

419
00:19:00,054 --> 00:19:04,295
You have betrayed us, we will make you pay. And then we will go back for your sons.

420
00:19:04,395 --> 00:19:05,384
Oh, my sons? No.

421
00:19:05,491 --> 00:19:08,634
They, too, will suffer for your terrible decisions.

422
00:19:08,738 --> 00:19:10,786
And you should really pay your workers what they deserve.

423
00:19:10,882 --> 00:19:12,770
Not make them have to buy their own supplies.

424
00:19:12,877 --> 00:19:14,632
Not just the painting, the sanding, too.

425
00:19:14,742 --> 00:19:17,355
Yeah, and the taping is very time-consuming.

426
00:19:17,452 --> 00:19:20,861
And Michael decided his father was ready to learn his lesson.

427
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,311
And that is why...

428
00:19:22,419 --> 00:19:23,990
He's got my gun! It's loaded!

429
00:19:24,905 --> 00:19:29,391
Get away, I'll shoot! I will! I will! I'll take you all out!

430
00:19:29,484 --> 00:19:31,427
This is all fake. These guys are painters!

431
00:19:31,531 --> 00:19:33,523
I'll kill you!

432
00:19:33,674 --> 00:19:34,620
Oh, God, my arm!

433
00:19:34,714 --> 00:19:37,890
Dad, you just shot off this... this guy's arm.

434
00:19:39,238 --> 00:19:43,448
And that's why you don't teach your father a lesson.

435
00:19:43,681 --> 00:19:45,642
Now who's the stupid one now?

436
00:19:45,777 --> 00:19:46,846
Thank you, Gob.

437
00:19:47,631 --> 00:19:48,508
"Gob?"

438
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,648
You told him? I thought we were a team.

439
00:19:51,021 --> 00:19:52,843
It's not fun feeling stupid, is it?

440
00:19:52,946 --> 00:19:54,263
You son of a...

441
00:19:55,576 --> 00:19:57,873
Wait a minute, I have to get my camera.

442
00:19:58,307 --> 00:20:00,727
What is all this? What's going on?

443
00:20:02,141 --> 00:20:02,897
Cheat out.

444
00:20:02,948 --> 00:20:05,297
- I will kill you!
- I'm going to kill you!

445
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:06,730
You're going out of frame.

446
00:20:09,061 --> 00:20:11,380
Oh, my God! Michael!

447
00:20:11,698 --> 00:20:15,502
Dad! It was an accident! I'm sorry.

448
00:20:16,586 --> 00:20:20,409
And that's why you don't pit Gob and me against each other.

449
00:20:20,504 --> 00:20:21,436
Yes!

450
00:20:21,782 --> 00:20:22,867
Yeah!

451
00:20:23,106 --> 00:20:23,994
You set me up.

452
00:20:24,108 --> 00:20:25,202
That's right!

453
00:20:25,322 --> 00:20:26,342
No more "Boyfights."

454
00:20:26,449 --> 00:20:28,568
J. Walter Weatherman was in on it, too?

455
00:20:28,665 --> 00:20:29,763
Right from the very start.

456
00:20:29,867 --> 00:20:31,694
So you did use him.

457
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,973
Look at this place. Look at my home.

458
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,041
Freeze!

459
00:20:36,153 --> 00:20:37,673
- Drop the gun. 
- Oh, God.

460
00:20:37,711 --> 00:20:39,145
We're just trying to teach this guy a lesson.

461
00:20:39,233 --> 00:20:40,204
Drop the gun!

462
00:20:41,735 --> 00:20:42,952
Oh, my God!

463
00:20:43,052 --> 00:20:46,544
Buster's good hand just... came... flying off.

464
00:20:47,933 --> 00:20:52,245
And that's why you don't use a one-armed person to scare someone.

465
00:20:54,352 --> 00:20:56,814
On the next... Arrested Development:

466
00:20:56,913 --> 00:20:59,868
Maeby finds a way to scare an entire generation.

467
00:20:59,965 --> 00:21:03,918
This Christmas, terror has a new face...

468
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:06,447
I'm thirsty...

469
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,503
Gangee.

470
00:21:09,908 --> 00:21:11,896
We should start production on Gangee 2.

471
00:21:12,101 --> 00:21:14,032
Well, I know she wanted a skin peel.

472
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,741
