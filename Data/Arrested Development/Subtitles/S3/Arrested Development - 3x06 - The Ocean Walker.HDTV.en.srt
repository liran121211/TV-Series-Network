1
00:00:00,589 --> 00:00:03,492
Now the story of a wealthy family who lost everything

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:07,249
and the one son who had no choice but to keep them all together.

3
00:00:13,141 --> 00:00:14,964
It's Arrested Development...

4
00:00:17,895 --> 00:00:21,680
Michael was sharing some very important news with his parents.

5
00:00:21,773 --> 00:00:23,591
I am getting married.

6
00:00:25,082 --> 00:00:26,248
Who the hell to?

7
00:00:26,721 --> 00:00:28,436
Who do you think? Rita.

8
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:30,280
Her?

9
00:00:30,386 --> 00:00:31,237
Why?

10
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:33,542
Well, first of all, she needs a green card to stay in the country.

11
00:00:33,629 --> 00:00:34,444
There it is.

12
00:00:34,545 --> 00:00:37,290
She needs a green card to stay in the country, because, secondly...

13
00:00:37,683 --> 00:00:39,082
we're really crazy about each other.

14
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:41,020
You hardly know her.

15
00:00:41,143 --> 00:00:43,541
I know all the important stuff. She was in the Olympics.

16
00:00:43,677 --> 00:00:47,251
She's sweet, she's smart, she's beautiful, she's special.

17
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:48,690
She was special.

18
00:00:48,794 --> 00:00:50,370
Are houses terribly hard to make?

19
00:00:50,454 --> 00:00:52,510
Actually, the hardest part is finding the land.

20
00:00:52,598 --> 00:00:54,636
But she wasn't smart.

21
00:00:54,741 --> 00:00:57,829
Instead of making houses, maybe you should make land.

22
00:00:58,211 --> 00:01:00,615
For Rita had only mentally progressed...

23
00:01:00,707 --> 00:01:01,621
On the ocean.

24
00:01:01,716 --> 00:01:03,512
...to the level of a first grader.

25
00:01:03,606 --> 00:01:05,807
There's no land on the ocean.

26
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:08,352
Michael might have noticed her disability

27
00:01:08,432 --> 00:01:11,569
if it had not been masked by her English accent.

28
00:01:11,664 --> 00:01:12,789
You're brilliant.

29
00:01:12,904 --> 00:01:14,610
Yeah... She wasn't.

30
00:01:14,632 --> 00:01:16,615
I know she's a really, really good person, and everything else

31
00:01:16,704 --> 00:01:18,474
is going to be little surprises along the way.

32
00:01:18,562 --> 00:01:21,241
With the exception of that one big one.

33
00:01:21,326 --> 00:01:22,383
The wedding?

34
00:01:22,877 --> 00:01:24,039
Is in one month.

35
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,329
A month?!

36
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,059
All right, now look, just because a woman gets pregnant

37
00:01:28,146 --> 00:01:29,893
doesn't mean you have to marry her.

38
00:01:29,971 --> 00:01:32,831
Too many lives have been ruined because some cheap waitress

39
00:01:32,907 --> 00:01:35,481
at a HoJo said she used an IUD.

40
00:01:35,571 --> 00:01:36,503
It was Stuckey's.

41
00:01:36,598 --> 00:01:37,840
But I believed you.

42
00:01:37,937 --> 00:01:40,624
She's not pregnant-- truthfully, we haven't even slept together.

43
00:01:42,082 --> 00:01:44,188
- This is funny!
- He's gay!

44
00:01:45,111 --> 00:01:46,221
Where's your hand?

45
00:01:46,403 --> 00:01:50,486
Oh. I'm having my high school ring put on it, and my hook is stuck in the staircar.

46
00:01:50,495 --> 00:01:53,901
Domo arigoto, Mister Roboto...

47
00:01:56,266 --> 00:01:58,603
Do you think getting married will solve your sex problem?

48
00:01:58,689 --> 00:02:01,047
No. And... we don't have a problem.

49
00:02:01,133 --> 00:02:03,353
We just haven't had the right opportunity yet.

50
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:05,356
Lindsay said Rita slept over last night.

51
00:02:05,498 --> 00:02:08,564
Yes. But I gave her the bedroom because I didn't want her to feel pressured.

52
00:02:08,657 --> 00:02:11,506
Actually, it was Michael who felt a little pressured.

53
00:02:11,629 --> 00:02:13,637
And I like to keep the light on.

54
00:02:13,816 --> 00:02:16,563
That way I can see if you have a monster.

55
00:02:17,309 --> 00:02:18,317
Night-night.

56
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:20,573
Can you shut the door on your way out?

57
00:02:20,729 --> 00:02:22,080
I can't believe you're not supporting this.

58
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:24,361
Because it is obvious what she's after.

59
00:02:24,451 --> 00:02:25,306
Our money.

60
00:02:25,399 --> 00:02:26,834
Oh, God, our money!

61
00:02:26,924 --> 00:02:30,093
Let's just all relax, and remind ourselves that we don't have any money.

62
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:31,596
She's already gotten our money!

63
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,899
Let's not forget she's the one that gave us the idea

64
00:02:33,969 --> 00:02:36,216
for that ocean-top town called "Bluthton."

65
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,085
Oh, big deal, I had that same basic idea years ago.

66
00:02:43,034 --> 00:02:45,180
I thought you'd be happy, and I should have known better.

67
00:02:45,288 --> 00:02:46,575
Michael, be careful.

68
00:02:47,177 --> 00:02:49,100
People just see what they want to see.

69
00:02:49,192 --> 00:02:51,194
If she loved you, she'd show it.

70
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:52,919
Michael was worried--

71
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,606
his mother may have been making sense.

72
00:02:56,003 --> 00:02:58,514
So, he returned home to talk to Rita.

73
00:02:58,613 --> 00:03:00,082
Ah, here comes the bride.

74
00:03:00,183 --> 00:03:01,683
Hey. What are you doing in a wheelchair?

75
00:03:01,775 --> 00:03:04,578
No, no, no, it's a dolly to help videotape your nuptials.

76
00:03:05,442 --> 00:03:07,642
I don't think I need any footage of my nuptials.

77
00:03:07,723 --> 00:03:12,138
Tobias, are you sure that this dolly isn't related to your recent health problems?

78
00:03:12,226 --> 00:03:15,710
Okay, so my legs and my left arm occasionally "go to sleep,"

79
00:03:15,802 --> 00:03:18,025
and you want to call it a health problem.

80
00:03:18,756 --> 00:03:20,076
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

81
00:03:20,157 --> 00:03:21,920
No, I can get up myself.

82
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:24,004
Here we go.

83
00:03:24,105 --> 00:03:25,608
Let me get in the dolly.

84
00:03:25,657 --> 00:03:27,226
No, thank you, I don't need your help.

85
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,507
It does seem like you've been having a whole lot of trouble since the hair transplants.

86
00:03:30,597 --> 00:03:33,049
Maybe you should see a bubuman.

87
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,629
A... "bubuman"?

88
00:03:34,712 --> 00:03:36,122
Oh, uh, a doctor.

89
00:03:36,214 --> 00:03:39,076
It's a British expression. Like they say "go-up box" instead of "elevator."

90
00:03:39,165 --> 00:03:41,702
Oh, like when they say "poofter" to mean "tourist," yes.

91
00:03:41,783 --> 00:03:43,330
Boy, that Rita's a smarty.

92
00:03:43,367 --> 00:03:46,115
True, but it's not like anybody appreciates it. Mom and Dad do not like Rita.

93
00:03:46,203 --> 00:03:47,711
Are they crazy?  She's amazing.

94
00:03:47,796 --> 00:03:50,457
I saw her last night and she helped with this little project I was doing.

95
00:03:50,556 --> 00:03:55,206
Maeby was struggling with a screen play in her secret life as a film executive.

96
00:03:55,299 --> 00:03:56,339
Is that a story?

97
00:03:56,434 --> 00:03:58,198
Not yet. It doesn't have an ending.

98
00:03:58,296 --> 00:04:01,740
He's in L.A., she's in Japan. How do I get these two characters together?

99
00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:03,435
Maybe they could walk.

100
00:04:03,532 --> 00:04:04,603
Across the ocean?

101
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:06,116
If it's not too deep.

102
00:04:06,201 --> 00:04:07,984
No, deep is good.

103
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:10,748
People are going to say, "What the hell just happened? I better say I like it."

104
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,170
'Cause nobody wants to seem stupid.

105
00:04:12,272 --> 00:04:13,221
I like it.

106
00:04:13,312 --> 00:04:14,448
The Ocean Walker.

107
00:04:14,524 --> 00:04:16,415
Holy crap, that's going to look good on a hat.

108
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:18,779
And Michael caught up with his brother.

109
00:04:18,868 --> 00:04:21,611
Pal, I need a favor. As you know, I'm getting married in about a month...

110
00:04:21,688 --> 00:04:22,685
Say no more.

111
00:04:22,774 --> 00:04:25,011
Great. Are you sure that you know what...

112
00:04:25,091 --> 00:04:26,800
Yup, yup, yup. Got it. Super.

113
00:04:26,893 --> 00:04:28,863
And-and, just so that we're both clear...

114
00:04:28,946 --> 00:04:31,803
You want me to do a magic show at the wedding. I'm on it.

115
00:04:31,895 --> 00:04:33,524
So glad we pushed through that.

116
00:04:33,646 --> 00:04:35,411
No magic.

117
00:04:35,777 --> 00:04:37,991
Why, because the one little screw up last time?

118
00:04:38,073 --> 00:04:39,211
Put her out! Put her out!

119
00:04:39,294 --> 00:04:40,009
Tracy!

120
00:04:40,846 --> 00:04:42,777
Thank God we already did the pictures.

121
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:46,068
Which reminds me that Rita shouldn't wear any hair spray at this thing.

122
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,099
I just want you to be my witness.

123
00:04:48,202 --> 00:04:49,343
Oh, you want me to...

124
00:04:51,516 --> 00:04:52,736
be your Best Man?

125
00:04:52,822 --> 00:04:55,257
It's just a signature I need. On the license.

126
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:57,812
My son's not old enough. It's no big deal.

127
00:04:57,923 --> 00:05:00,559
I will not take this sacred duty lightly.

128
00:05:01,084 --> 00:05:06,466
I am going to get you the single healthiest call girl that this town has ever seen.

129
00:05:06,564 --> 00:05:08,337
This is why I'm calling it a "Witness," and not a "Best Man."

130
00:05:08,424 --> 00:05:10,112
All you have to do is watch.

131
00:05:10,203 --> 00:05:12,996
Oh, I'm not going to spend this kind of money and not watch.

132
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,081
This may have been a bad choice.

133
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,289
Hey, hello. Well, look at you two, Tweedle Dee, Tweedle Dum.

134
00:05:20,382 --> 00:05:22,352
Michael didn't mean it in that way.

135
00:05:22,446 --> 00:05:24,454
How could he, he didn't even know.

136
00:05:24,535 --> 00:05:25,883
We had the best time!

137
00:05:25,985 --> 00:05:27,749
She's got such an amazing fashion sense.

138
00:05:27,831 --> 00:05:29,265
You guys have these jackets on inside out?

139
00:05:29,351 --> 00:05:30,843
Yeah, that way you see the label.

140
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:34,286
Yeah, I mean, that's what you're paying for, right? It's a great statement on fashion.

141
00:05:34,368 --> 00:05:35,947
Plus, it doesn't tickle your neck.

142
00:05:38,618 --> 00:05:41,465
Michael took Lindsay aside to share his concerns.

143
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,636
So, Lindsay, when did you first realize that you and Tobias

144
00:05:44,714 --> 00:05:46,973
had no chance at a physical relationship?

145
00:05:47,082 --> 00:05:49,997
Oh, my God, do you think we have no chance at a physical relationship?

146
00:05:50,204 --> 00:05:51,386
Just now.

147
00:05:51,532 --> 00:05:54,249
Um, see, Rita and I have not been physical yet, and...

148
00:05:54,377 --> 00:05:56,969
You don't think that she's doing this just for a green card, do you?

149
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:59,176
No. No, she's not that kind of person.

150
00:05:59,268 --> 00:06:01,346
No, you just haven't been alone with her.

151
00:06:01,499 --> 00:06:03,833
Ask her to stay over at a hotel with you tonight.

152
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:05,793
She's going to know what that means.

153
00:06:05,886 --> 00:06:08,909
That is not a bad idea. Don't... don't do that.

154
00:06:09,218 --> 00:06:13,217
And Gob began to prepare a magic trick for Michael's wedding.

155
00:06:13,615 --> 00:06:15,126
King... takes his queen...

156
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,210
and showers her with diamonds!

157
00:06:18,441 --> 00:06:19,298
Clubs.

158
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,774
Club sauce.

159
00:06:21,286 --> 00:06:23,540
He covers her with club sauce.

160
00:06:23,795 --> 00:06:25,690
Right, that'll be my line if that happens.

161
00:06:25,781 --> 00:06:27,022
Is that a magic trick?

162
00:06:27,109 --> 00:06:28,643
I love magic.

163
00:06:29,026 --> 00:06:31,488
I don't appreciate the dry British humor.

164
00:06:33,739 --> 00:06:36,541
Please do a magic trick for me.

165
00:06:36,632 --> 00:06:38,108
Well, I shouldn't...

166
00:06:38,371 --> 00:06:44,173
I'd hate to be blamed for setting another one of Michael's brides... on fire!

167
00:06:44,705 --> 00:06:47,732
Oh, lighter fluid--like Uncle Trevor uses!

168
00:06:47,818 --> 00:06:49,569
But wherever did it come from?

169
00:06:49,658 --> 00:06:52,338
Okay, I've got to get you into an illusion at the wedding.

170
00:06:52,626 --> 00:06:54,157
How long can you hold your breath?

171
00:06:54,244 --> 00:06:56,582
Oh, long. One time, 20 minutes.

172
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,496
Actually, her record was 20 seconds.

173
00:06:59,578 --> 00:07:00,311
You can stop it.

174
00:07:00,749 --> 00:07:02,383
Okay. I'll take your word for it.

175
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:05,641
Now, I just need to find a trick that puts you out of oxygen for 20 minutes.

176
00:07:05,741 --> 00:07:07,487
Sorry, did I hear the word "trick"?

177
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,415
And it smells a lot like lighter fluid in here.

178
00:07:09,497 --> 00:07:11,814
You know, I did say no tricks, Gob, and I mean it.

179
00:07:11,906 --> 00:07:14,809
What if I find a trick that has her float to the alter or something?

180
00:07:14,895 --> 00:07:16,882
No, no. Love for her to walk. And not to drown.

181
00:07:16,972 --> 00:07:19,519
Or fly through the air. Or catch on fire.

182
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:20,930
Is she allergic to cat fur?

183
00:07:21,018 --> 00:07:22,556
Oop-- no tigers.

184
00:07:22,725 --> 00:07:23,602
Right.

185
00:07:24,576 --> 00:07:26,660
So, uh, Rita, um...

186
00:07:26,829 --> 00:07:32,094
I was wondering if maybe you and I might head down to a hotel.

187
00:07:32,186 --> 00:07:33,973
Maybe some alone time.

188
00:07:34,061 --> 00:07:36,017
- Oh, yes.
- Yeah?

189
00:07:36,116 --> 00:07:38,560
Maybe our rooms could touch.

190
00:07:39,207 --> 00:07:43,104
Well, I-I-I was hoping maybe for more than just our rooms to touch.

191
00:07:43,201 --> 00:07:48,205
I was... thinking maybe we could be... in the same room.

192
00:07:48,465 --> 00:07:50,028
Be in the same bed.

193
00:07:50,128 --> 00:07:53,820
Oh, I see what you mean, a real sleepover.

194
00:07:53,908 --> 00:07:54,753
Well, maybe.

195
00:07:54,835 --> 00:07:55,627
Okay.

196
00:07:55,738 --> 00:07:56,683
Really?

197
00:07:56,761 --> 00:08:00,155
Well, maybe I should go home and get my things. I do kind of miss my jammies.

198
00:08:00,239 --> 00:08:02,507
I think they're going to have a lot of that stuff there.

199
00:08:02,603 --> 00:08:04,970
And my tiny teddy.

200
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,332
Good. Yes, get that.

201
00:08:08,229 --> 00:08:11,217
And so George Michael drove Rita to Wee Britain.

202
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,610
It's nice to be with someone young.

203
00:08:13,891 --> 00:08:16,705
We can listen to young people's music for a change.

204
00:08:16,783 --> 00:08:18,192
Great, yeah, please.

205
00:08:18,669 --> 00:08:25,986
- Hot potato, hot potato...
- Hot po-ta-to... Hot "potat-o"...

206
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:28,971
That's when he first grew concerned.

207
00:08:30,532 --> 00:08:32,945
And Rita packed for her sleepover.

208
00:08:33,036 --> 00:08:34,936
Do you have any idea what a "sleepover" is?

209
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:36,298
Cause it's not just sleep.

210
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:39,892
I know what it is, Trevor, I've seen your secret magazine.

211
00:08:42,503 --> 00:08:44,636
I want to have grown-up fun.

212
00:08:44,735 --> 00:08:46,423
Spoon and figgy pudding.

213
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,905
Rabbit downdum druggary's hollow.

214
00:08:49,017 --> 00:08:51,046
And I want to have pop-pop.

215
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:53,925
Well, the very fact that you call it that, tells me you're not ready.

216
00:08:54,052 --> 00:08:57,463
Oh, and for your information, that's a cricket magazine.

217
00:09:00,055 --> 00:09:02,890
Whether you like it or not, you're still a child in many ways.

218
00:09:02,983 --> 00:09:05,921
I've got a problem with you having sexual relations with that man.

219
00:09:06,014 --> 00:09:06,870
So do I.

220
00:09:06,969 --> 00:09:10,413
I mean, it's not your fault your parents were cousins, but... here we are.

221
00:09:10,498 --> 00:09:13,528
Now, I've been charged with taking care of you, and I'm bloody well going to do it!

222
00:09:13,628 --> 00:09:18,221
Well, Michael will be my cousin soon enough, cause we're getting married.

223
00:09:18,315 --> 00:09:19,665
- Married?!
- Married!

224
00:09:19,762 --> 00:09:20,911
Totally out of the question!

225
00:09:21,001 --> 00:09:22,623
Married! Married! Married!

226
00:09:22,705 --> 00:09:25,375
All right, that does it. You're not going anywhere.

227
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:27,112
I'm putting the invisible locks on the door.

228
00:09:27,206 --> 00:09:28,381
That's not fair.

229
00:09:28,498 --> 00:09:30,084
- Lock. Lock. Lock. 
- That's not fair!

230
00:09:30,177 --> 00:09:31,808
- It's just not fair! 
- Lock. Lock.

231
00:09:34,211 --> 00:09:36,771
I've got to find a new hiding place for that magazine.

232
00:09:36,945 --> 00:09:39,232
And Michael was waiting at the hotel.

233
00:09:39,319 --> 00:09:40,371
Hey, Dad?

234
00:09:40,522 --> 00:09:44,372
Just wanted to let you know that I'm at a hotel with my wife-to-be,

235
00:09:44,455 --> 00:09:47,250
and we're very, very much in love.

236
00:09:47,827 --> 00:09:48,718
Put her on.

237
00:09:49,036 --> 00:09:51,875
Michael briefly considered faking the voice.

238
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,979
I... She's in the shower.

239
00:09:54,067 --> 00:09:55,808
- I'll wait.
- Let's wait.

240
00:10:00,721 --> 00:10:02,628
Unless you want me to just call you back or...

241
00:10:02,741 --> 00:10:05,447
No, I have nowhere to go, I'm under house arrest.

242
00:10:05,544 --> 00:10:07,669
Let's watch something together.

243
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:11,884
Wow, that Blossom blew up, huh?

244
00:10:11,977 --> 00:10:13,336
Say, how's that shower coming?

245
00:10:13,437 --> 00:10:15,314
All right, look, she's not in the shower.

246
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:16,342
Really?

247
00:10:16,579 --> 00:10:19,540
She said that she'd meet me at the hotel and I-I called you a little prematurely.

248
00:10:19,615 --> 00:10:20,717
But she is coming.

249
00:10:20,846 --> 00:10:21,707
Really?

250
00:10:27,697 --> 00:10:29,434
Hey, put Rita on.

251
00:10:29,598 --> 00:10:33,955
And that's when Michael finally accepted that Rita wasn't coming.

252
00:10:34,596 --> 00:10:37,742
And that local calls were $2.95 a minute.

253
00:10:37,843 --> 00:10:39,004
Come on!

254
00:10:39,112 --> 00:10:40,607
That's where they get you.

255
00:10:43,374 --> 00:10:46,385
Michael drove to Wee Britain to call off the wedding

256
00:10:46,489 --> 00:10:49,503
that he now realized was not based on love.

257
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:50,595
Who is it?

258
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:52,625
It's Michael, Rita. Can I come in?

259
00:10:52,722 --> 00:10:54,396
I can't let you in!

260
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:55,994
You know, you didn't show up last night.

261
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:58,189
I think the least you can do is talk to me face-to-face.

262
00:10:58,292 --> 00:10:59,234
I can't.

263
00:10:59,345 --> 00:11:00,682
Trevor locked the door.

264
00:11:00,782 --> 00:11:02,918
He doesn't want me to be with you.

265
00:11:03,131 --> 00:11:05,615
What, he locked the door? You can't unlock this door?

266
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,691
I can't even see half the locks!

267
00:11:07,774 --> 00:11:10,019
- Rita? What?
- They're invisible.

268
00:11:10,112 --> 00:11:13,076
- Trevor's the only one who can see them.
- I'm trapped! Listen, I've got an idea.

269
00:11:13,158 --> 00:11:15,155
Go next to the window. I'm gonna climb up.

270
00:11:17,122 --> 00:11:18,476
Be careful.

271
00:11:18,624 --> 00:11:19,514
I will!

272
00:11:22,455 --> 00:11:28,415
And so, Michael set about rescuing the beautiful, sweet, mentally challenged woman

273
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:33,254
he'd fallen in love with, without realizing she was mentally challenged.

274
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,035
- Yay! Michael! Yay!
- What's this?

275
00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:36,046
- Someone undid the locks.
- Okay, come on out. 

276
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:36,796
Trevor's back.

277
00:11:36,884 --> 00:11:39,480
Oh. Fine. Come on, hop on.

278
00:11:39,794 --> 00:11:40,959
- What? 
- Hop on.

279
00:11:42,442 --> 00:11:43,261
Ready?

280
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,475
Hey! Stop that. Both of you come back!

281
00:11:51,572 --> 00:11:52,908
You can't stop us!

282
00:11:53,002 --> 00:11:54,724
Nothing can stop us now.

283
00:11:54,864 --> 00:11:59,405
Nothing in the world of man nor beast, nor time is...

284
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,653
I hate that ( bleep ) doll.

285
00:12:03,678 --> 00:12:05,814
And so, reunited with Rita,

286
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,524
Michael told his parents he'd be getting married tomorrow.

287
00:12:09,617 --> 00:12:11,736
Well, God help her if she tries to rename Bluthton.

288
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,721
I'll sink it first.

289
00:12:12,826 --> 00:12:14,622
I swear, I'll sink the whole damn thing.

290
00:12:15,124 --> 00:12:17,013
They're going through with it... tomorrow.

291
00:12:17,622 --> 00:12:21,140
But that's when George and Lucille had a surprise visitor.

292
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,340
All right, where the hell is Rita?

293
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,343
I'm her uncle.

294
00:12:24,473 --> 00:12:25,827
Let the hand-outs begin!

295
00:12:25,936 --> 00:12:29,125
There's not gonna be any hand-outs, and she is not gonna marry your son.

296
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,441
You're against this marriage, too?

297
00:12:30,562 --> 00:12:31,850
Well, of course I am.

298
00:12:31,966 --> 00:12:34,355
Rita's not capable of making a decision like that.

299
00:12:34,471 --> 00:12:38,595
You are not gonna get Rita's millions just because she's mentally challenged.

300
00:12:38,686 --> 00:12:39,593
Millions?

301
00:12:39,746 --> 00:12:40,438
Millions?

302
00:12:40,545 --> 00:12:41,698
Mentally challenged?

303
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:43,854
Shh! It's not polite.

304
00:12:43,956 --> 00:12:45,669
She owns all of Wee Britain.

305
00:12:45,774 --> 00:12:47,658
And also the Wee Britain in Cleveland.

306
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:49,582
Of course, we're probably gonna lose all that

307
00:12:49,706 --> 00:12:52,869
if her ridiculous idea for Sea Britain goes through.

308
00:12:53,984 --> 00:12:56,083
We are not after her money.

309
00:12:56,208 --> 00:13:00,291
And I don't think Michael even knows about her... condition.

310
00:13:00,401 --> 00:13:02,752
Yes, it's funny how Americans don't pick up on that.

311
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,900
I think it's 'cause of her accent and the plastic surgery she's been able to afford.

312
00:13:07,014 --> 00:13:09,513
We wouldn't have this trouble if they'd met last year.

313
00:13:10,872 --> 00:13:12,566
I got to put a stop to this.

314
00:13:12,655 --> 00:13:15,156
We're gonna search every bloody hotel in town.

315
00:13:15,254 --> 00:13:16,292
Oh, Legoland.

316
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:19,299
- I think they said they were going to Legoland.
- They did say Legoland.

317
00:13:19,385 --> 00:13:21,185
I didn't hear anything about Legoland.

318
00:13:21,586 --> 00:13:23,791
He doesn't know what's talking about.

319
00:13:24,238 --> 00:13:26,881
We think he may be mentally challenged.

320
00:13:26,928 --> 00:13:27,691
What?

321
00:13:27,814 --> 00:13:28,919
All right then.

322
00:13:29,681 --> 00:13:32,380
We have got 24 hours to get them married

323
00:13:32,489 --> 00:13:35,332
before Michael figures out what she really is.

324
00:13:35,424 --> 00:13:41,258
This the first time in two years you've sounded like George Bluth.

325
00:13:43,452 --> 00:13:47,289
Later that night, Michael was at the hotel with his bride to be.

326
00:13:47,739 --> 00:13:49,996
Rita, I've been really looking forward to this.

327
00:13:50,105 --> 00:13:51,055
Me, too.

328
00:13:51,167 --> 00:13:55,174
I want to have sexual relations.

329
00:13:55,303 --> 00:13:58,469
Mere fact that you call it that tells me that you are ready.

330
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:00,227
That's why I brought this.

331
00:14:00,334 --> 00:14:01,204
No.

332
00:14:01,878 --> 00:14:03,709
Why don't you go ahead and whip out that tiny teddy,

333
00:14:03,805 --> 00:14:06,279
and then we're gonna think up a fun safe word, okay?

334
00:14:07,197 --> 00:14:10,471
George Michael. I did not know that you were...

335
00:14:10,686 --> 00:14:14,160
Um, go ahead and... talk out here.

336
00:14:14,263 --> 00:14:17,872
We just got back from the bumpaddle courts. Tomorrow, I'm teaching her baseball.

337
00:14:17,972 --> 00:14:19,524
Yeah. That may take a while.

338
00:14:19,612 --> 00:14:20,274
Sorry?

339
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:25,025
Well, listen, Dad, th-this is... hard for... This is hard for me to say this...

340
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,679
I was videotaping Rita.

341
00:14:27,101 --> 00:14:30,331
Let's just say it would be cute if it was someone much younger.

342
00:14:32,232 --> 00:14:33,963
I'm sorry. We really should get another tape.

343
00:14:34,065 --> 00:14:35,485
I mean, they're not expensive.

344
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:41,036
It's the plastic fruit, Dad.

345
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,715
It's very convincing fruit, okay?

346
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,746
Is she going back in for another?

347
00:14:50,727 --> 00:14:54,215
Well, you know, they don't even have bananas in England, okay, son?

348
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:59,924
Now, I know this is hard for you, but it would be nice to be supported in some...

349
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:02,465
Oh, no, she's going into the grapes.

350
00:15:02,604 --> 00:15:04,022
Yeah, she really liked those.

351
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:06,735
I'm sorry.

352
00:15:07,176 --> 00:15:08,649
I think she might be...

353
00:15:09,081 --> 00:15:10,741
retar... retarded.

354
00:15:13,576 --> 00:15:14,453
I'm sorry.

355
00:15:14,578 --> 00:15:15,603
I'm really sorry.

356
00:15:20,718 --> 00:15:23,309
Say hello to my tiny teddy.

357
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:26,335
Oh! Tiny Teddy!

358
00:15:27,167 --> 00:15:29,385
And that's when it dawned on Michael.

359
00:15:29,487 --> 00:15:30,782
Oh, you teach kids, huh?

360
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:32,917
Oh, I like to think they teach me.

361
00:15:33,331 --> 00:15:36,520
That way I can see if you have a monster.

362
00:15:39,922 --> 00:15:41,182
Be careful.

363
00:15:49,923 --> 00:15:51,843
I've made a huge mistake.

364
00:15:57,663 --> 00:16:02,175
Michael had just been shown that his fiancée might be mentally challenged,

365
00:16:02,269 --> 00:16:03,489
but he needed proof.

366
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:05,569
Are you ready for lie down kisses with me?

367
00:16:05,651 --> 00:16:08,207
Maybe we ought to just talk a little bit, you know? I mean, what the heck.

368
00:16:08,289 --> 00:16:13,109
For instance, you've never told me how many houses there are in the British Parliament.

369
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,100
Seven.

370
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:14,991
Are there?

371
00:16:15,092 --> 00:16:16,700
The answer is three.

372
00:16:16,796 --> 00:16:17,927
Does sound about right.

373
00:16:18,022 --> 00:16:20,048
Three is the correct answer.

374
00:16:20,427 --> 00:16:21,764
- Come on. 
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

375
00:16:21,808 --> 00:16:23,346
Let's have our fun.

376
00:16:23,838 --> 00:16:26,912
Rita corny, Michael.

377
00:16:27,001 --> 00:16:29,895
So, Michael used a line that was just as corny.

378
00:16:30,005 --> 00:16:35,576
You know, I think that we should wait until after we're married.

379
00:16:37,138 --> 00:16:38,123
Married!

380
00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:40,246
Married, married, married!

381
00:16:40,345 --> 00:16:41,921
Okay, night-night.

382
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:48,289
And Michael felt he deserved a $15 thing of candy beans.

383
00:16:52,308 --> 00:16:56,137
The next morning, however, as Michael prepared to let Rita down gently,

384
00:16:56,207 --> 00:16:58,807
- he was met with another surprise.
- Surprise!

385
00:16:59,286 --> 00:17:00,074
What's this?

386
00:17:00,171 --> 00:17:01,787
We're throwing you a wedding.

387
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:04,416
Oh, how lovely!

388
00:17:04,561 --> 00:17:05,659
On us.

389
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:06,887
Everything you see.

390
00:17:06,997 --> 00:17:08,729
Show them the waffle bar, Larry.

391
00:17:08,871 --> 00:17:09,874
It's over there.

392
00:17:09,976 --> 00:17:11,753
And check out banner, Michael!

393
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:13,374
I'm gonna go set up.

394
00:17:13,996 --> 00:17:16,935
Yeah, you know, I-I was just gonna talk to Rita about all of this.

395
00:17:17,026 --> 00:17:21,679
Rita, I think that we should, um, wait a little while.

396
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,873
Wait? Why? I don't want to wait.

397
00:17:23,964 --> 00:17:25,814
I want to get married

398
00:17:25,935 --> 00:17:29,567
and have sexual relations like you promised.

399
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,982
Where did you get this firecracker?

400
00:17:32,069 --> 00:17:33,901
I... love her, Michael.

401
00:17:33,996 --> 00:17:36,526
So do I. I want to kiss my new daughter-in-law.

402
00:17:36,624 --> 00:17:38,087
Hey, not on our time, Larry.

403
00:17:38,176 --> 00:17:38,852
Right on the lips.

404
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,372
No, no, Dad, please take it easy.

405
00:17:40,456 --> 00:17:42,936
I'm gonna go get my dress from the... from the room.

406
00:17:43,024 --> 00:17:45,291
Yes, I'll help you put it on inside out!

407
00:17:45,572 --> 00:17:47,971
Let's-let's not all get, um...

408
00:17:48,092 --> 00:17:51,145
Hey, Mom, what-what's going on? I thought that you guys were against all this.

409
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:55,912
Well, we figured you know best, and who are we to interfere, and you love this girl,

410
00:17:56,015 --> 00:18:01,498
and the rest will just be little happy surprises along the way. Like you said.

411
00:18:01,597 --> 00:18:04,604
Yeah. With the exception of the retard thing.

412
00:18:06,609 --> 00:18:07,464
Oh, God.

413
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:09,575
Tell me you didn't just say that.

414
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:10,911
You knew?

415
00:18:11,627 --> 00:18:14,238
You knew, and yet, you still wanted me to go through with this?

416
00:18:14,337 --> 00:18:15,277
What can I say?

417
00:18:15,369 --> 00:18:17,385
I'm crazy about the little dullard.

418
00:18:17,487 --> 00:18:18,621
Oh, my God.

419
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:19,915
She's rich.

420
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:22,770
This is a new low, even for you, Mom.

421
00:18:25,506 --> 00:18:27,197
What is wrong with you?!

422
00:18:27,305 --> 00:18:28,831
Larry go to a mirror!

423
00:18:31,525 --> 00:18:32,965
- You're fired.
- You're fired.

424
00:18:33,058 --> 00:18:34,043
What?!

425
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,185
It's over.

426
00:18:35,341 --> 00:18:37,934
And this is how you tell me, in the middle of a wedding?

427
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,296
You shouldn't have said anything.

428
00:18:39,695 --> 00:18:42,042
So, you were right. Now what am I gonna do?

429
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:45,754
Well, I've been thinking. You know, I mean, every society has their own rules about this stuff.

430
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:48,624
For instance, in some states, it's legal to marry your own cousin.

431
00:18:48,729 --> 00:18:49,954
California's blocked it twice,

432
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,840
but that's only because they tacked it onto an estate law thing that wasn't gonna pass.

433
00:18:52,928 --> 00:18:54,003
We had the signatures...

434
00:18:54,109 --> 00:18:56,553
You're 16, and you know all that. She's 30 and a half.

435
00:18:56,648 --> 00:18:58,263
She probably can't list the seven Houses of Parliament.

436
00:18:58,345 --> 00:18:59,056
There's three.

437
00:18:59,175 --> 00:19:00,688
Now I got to break her heart.

438
00:19:01,252 --> 00:19:03,719
Well, doesn't she have to leave the country if you don't marry her?

439
00:19:04,028 --> 00:19:06,679
Yeah, I guess I can keep my promise about that, huh?

440
00:19:06,782 --> 00:19:11,144
There wouldn't be any real intimacy, and-and it would be the strongest marriage in the family,

441
00:19:11,235 --> 00:19:13,831
but, you know, as much as I'd like to, you can't ignore the fact

442
00:19:13,927 --> 00:19:16,362
that she is mentally disabled.

443
00:19:16,465 --> 00:19:17,481
Oh, my God.

444
00:19:21,047 --> 00:19:23,104
I'm wearing an inside out bridesmaid's dress.

445
00:19:23,226 --> 00:19:24,244
You better catch her, Dad.

446
00:19:24,345 --> 00:19:26,623
That's not gonna be easy. She's an Olympic Silver.

447
00:19:28,814 --> 00:19:30,195
Just figured that one out.

448
00:19:31,515 --> 00:19:35,005
Okay. Well, I'll have to go stop production on The Ocean Walker.

449
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,289
You found out.

450
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:41,725
Took me long enough.

451
00:19:42,338 --> 00:19:45,258
Maybe you're not smart, either.

452
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,375
I didn't know until they told me.

453
00:19:47,481 --> 00:19:50,834
No, I'm just a narcissist who was too self-involved to see the truth.

454
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,846
That makes no sense to me.

455
00:19:52,986 --> 00:19:55,876
Yeah, maybe you're right. Maybe I'm being too hard on myself.

456
00:19:56,091 --> 00:20:00,157
You know, the truth is, is that I did just see what I wanted to see, Rita.

457
00:20:00,257 --> 00:20:03,349
You're so beautiful, and you're so sweet.

458
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:07,685
And you deserve to find somebody a lot more like you.

459
00:20:07,784 --> 00:20:10,759
I don't think that either of us would be happy.

460
00:20:10,857 --> 00:20:12,914
So, it's bye-bye to Rita, then?

461
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,044
Unless you really want to stay in America.

462
00:20:15,198 --> 00:20:17,373
I wanted to be with you.

463
00:20:17,556 --> 00:20:19,397
Oy, Rita!

464
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:20,608
Time to go now.

465
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:22,686
Back to England, love.

466
00:20:23,357 --> 00:20:25,978
Oh, Michael, will you come visit me lots?

467
00:20:26,168 --> 00:20:29,072
That's gonna be difficult, Rita. You're gonna be across an ocean.

468
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:30,660
Well, you can always walk.

469
00:20:30,755 --> 00:20:32,034
Not on the water.

470
00:20:32,161 --> 00:20:34,610
Oh, Michael, you're such a grown-up.

471
00:20:42,113 --> 00:20:43,233
Hey, hey!

472
00:20:47,777 --> 00:20:50,281
Hang on a sec. That's part of your trick, right?

473
00:20:50,758 --> 00:20:51,739
No.

474
00:20:52,646 --> 00:20:54,743
That's not my trick, Michael.

475
00:20:58,849 --> 00:21:01,072
On the next... Arrested development...

476
00:21:01,706 --> 00:21:03,470
It's my illusion.

477
00:21:03,771 --> 00:21:06,123
Michael relives a wedding nightmare.

478
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,639
- Oh, put him out, put him out!
- My hair, my beautiful hair!

479
00:21:08,736 --> 00:21:09,801
Push him in the pool.

480
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,995
Why am I not going under water?

481
00:21:12,109 --> 00:21:14,395
Dear God, why am I not going under water?

482
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:14,933
