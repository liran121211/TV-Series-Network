1
00:00:00,537 --> 00:00:03,518
Now the story of a wealthy family who lost everything

2
00:00:03,585 --> 00:00:07,192
and the one son who had no choice but to keep them all together.

3
00:00:13,075 --> 00:00:14,965
It's Arrested Development...

4
00:00:17,394 --> 00:00:20,458
Michael Bluth paid an unexpected visit to his mother.

5
00:00:20,553 --> 00:00:21,745
You look pretty, Mom.

6
00:00:21,846 --> 00:00:22,750
What do you need?

7
00:00:22,852 --> 00:00:23,941
Need? Why do you think I need something?

8
00:00:24,021 --> 00:00:26,145
Well, you're too busy for us. No one's seen you.

9
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:28,105
Going on all those dates with Rita.

10
00:00:28,196 --> 00:00:30,242
Or should I say... "play dates."

11
00:00:30,341 --> 00:00:35,340
Michael had recently dated a woman he later found out was mentally challenged.

12
00:00:35,432 --> 00:00:37,541
We're not seeing each other any more, but it's for the best.

13
00:00:37,624 --> 00:00:39,217
I'm actually kind of relieved it's over.

14
00:00:39,305 --> 00:00:43,037
Actually, Michael had been so devastated by their breakup

15
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:45,771
that he'd even broken out the old guitar.

16
00:00:54,501 --> 00:00:56,035
Maybe you should talk to someone.

17
00:00:56,764 --> 00:00:57,844
Like my mom?

18
00:00:58,839 --> 00:01:00,239
I don't know, does she play guitar?

19
00:01:00,984 --> 00:01:03,388
So, can't a guy call his mom pretty without it seeming strange?

20
00:01:03,487 --> 00:01:04,316
Amen!

21
00:01:04,404 --> 00:01:06,425
And how about that little piece of tail on her?

22
00:01:06,518 --> 00:01:07,711
Cute!

23
00:01:07,808 --> 00:01:09,579
I've opened a door here that I regret.

24
00:01:09,667 --> 00:01:11,988
Oh, he's just talking about his stupid turtle.

25
00:01:12,103 --> 00:01:13,454
She has a name, Mother.

26
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,738
And it's "Mother."

27
00:01:14,811 --> 00:01:17,098
Buster had recently brought home a turtle

28
00:01:17,178 --> 00:01:20,885
in an incredibly misguided attempt to make his mother jealous.

29
00:01:20,967 --> 00:01:25,066
Stay in this box that Uncle/Father Oscar left behind.

30
00:01:25,149 --> 00:01:29,279
In fact, it was a box of Oscar's legally obtained medical marijuana.

31
00:01:29,375 --> 00:01:32,685
- Oh, good, you've already got grass.
- Primo bud. Real sticky weed.

32
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,831
Although I was getting a little worried because she was moving really slowly last week.

33
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:37,506
And then she stopped.

34
00:01:39,003 --> 00:01:42,053
Yeah, well, in any event, I'm here, Mom, because you need me.

35
00:01:42,127 --> 00:01:45,357
As you know, the Bluth Foundation dinner is a week away.

36
00:01:45,448 --> 00:01:49,736
I am your cochair, and we don't want to relive the "TBA" debacle.

37
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:53,888
Years earlier, the Bluths had a hard time agreeing on a cause

38
00:01:53,969 --> 00:01:56,335
for their foundation's first fund-raiser.

39
00:01:56,421 --> 00:01:57,693
"Herpes."

40
00:01:58,495 --> 00:01:59,498
"Shrinkage."

41
00:01:59,607 --> 00:02:01,582
Somebody saw Seinfeld last night.

42
00:02:02,245 --> 00:02:03,370
"Neck flap."

43
00:02:04,394 --> 00:02:07,130
"Ovarian cancer." Gee, I wonder who that was.

44
00:02:08,017 --> 00:02:09,456
I'm more for neck flap.

45
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:10,007
Yes.

46
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:12,876
Well, I'll be honest, I haven't heard anything that beats herpes.

47
00:02:12,961 --> 00:02:17,267
So they sent out invitations with the disease still to be announced.

48
00:02:17,341 --> 00:02:19,177
And, much to their surprise,

49
00:02:19,253 --> 00:02:24,559
the Bluths ended up raising over $25,000 to fight "TBA."

50
00:02:24,828 --> 00:02:27,683
And then-- and here's the really horrible part--

51
00:02:27,774 --> 00:02:29,894
they did it again the following year.

52
00:02:29,988 --> 00:02:33,417
Keep fighting, little guy. With your support of the Bluth Foundation,

53
00:02:33,501 --> 00:02:37,874
we'll live in a galaxy where "TBA" does not exist.

54
00:02:37,963 --> 00:02:41,046
When people at the last gala found out, we almost had a riot on our hands.

55
00:02:41,133 --> 00:02:43,958
Well, you don't have to worry about anything like that this year,

56
00:02:44,025 --> 00:02:47,972
because Warden Gentles is the new cochair.

57
00:02:48,058 --> 00:02:49,375
The guy who ran Dad's prison?

58
00:02:49,466 --> 00:02:53,356
He's here now installing cameras because of all your father's escape attempts.

59
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:56,652
Uh, yeah, looks like I won't be going anywhere for a little while.

60
00:02:56,733 --> 00:02:59,869
What do I care, huh? I have a beautiful wife, I have a wonderful hobby.

61
00:02:59,952 --> 00:03:03,317
Hah-- look at me, I'm having the time of my life!

62
00:03:03,399 --> 00:03:07,227
His hobby was making papier-mâché copies of his own head.

63
00:03:07,313 --> 00:03:10,350
Oh, before I forget, do you know if these cameras are hi-def?

64
00:03:10,433 --> 00:03:12,407
I certainly hope so.

65
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:15,560
It'll help me better understand George Bluth,

66
00:03:15,646 --> 00:03:21,428
the main character of the latest and, I pray, final draft of my screenplay, New Warden.

67
00:03:21,522 --> 00:03:22,765
You wrote a screenplay, huh?

68
00:03:22,856 --> 00:03:25,003
I promised myself I wasn't going to become one of those people

69
00:03:25,077 --> 00:03:27,282
who were always going on about their screenplays.

70
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:32,261
So, I'll just say I put together a staged reading with some fabulous young actors,

71
00:03:32,357 --> 00:03:34,324
and it was very well received.

72
00:03:34,427 --> 00:03:38,756
Warden Gentles had convinced his granddaughters' teacher to mount New Warden

73
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:41,563
- as a school play.
- I understand I've been causing problems.

74
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:45,862
Nobody sells any coke in this pen without daddy getting a taste.

75
00:03:45,936 --> 00:03:48,601
Beat him with a pillow case full of batteries.

76
00:03:49,167 --> 00:03:52,785
Ward's letting us hold the event in the new wing of the prison.

77
00:03:52,876 --> 00:03:57,205
After lockdown, everyone's going to spend the night in a cell!

78
00:04:00,111 --> 00:04:02,082
Are they color or black and white?

79
00:04:02,171 --> 00:04:04,506
So, Michael, I don't need your help at all.

80
00:04:04,602 --> 00:04:06,850
Unless you need something from me?

81
00:04:06,935 --> 00:04:08,816
No, I'm fine. Just thought I could help.

82
00:04:08,906 --> 00:04:10,372
Relieved I don't have to.

83
00:04:11,731 --> 00:04:13,101
But he wasn't relieved.

84
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,993
So, he went home to complain to his sister Lindsay.

85
00:04:16,078 --> 00:04:18,814
Prison's the last thing we want people associating with the Bluth name.

86
00:04:18,885 --> 00:04:20,077
Plus, who's going to want to go?

87
00:04:20,148 --> 00:04:21,853
Wait, this is going to be at the prison?

88
00:04:21,906 --> 00:04:23,903
Oh, great. Probably going to run into that warden.

89
00:04:23,998 --> 00:04:25,308
How do you know the warden?

90
00:04:25,491 --> 00:04:29,648
Oh, right. Uh, he spoke at my school for a "Startled Straight" assembly.

91
00:04:29,726 --> 00:04:35,033
Actually, she'd met with him in the hopes of using his prison as a location for a film.

92
00:04:35,115 --> 00:04:38,255
I think you will find the dessert both engrossing

93
00:04:38,651 --> 00:04:40,316
and high grossing.

94
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:42,956
So, we don't get dessert?

95
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:44,899
Guess I have some reading to do.

96
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:49,013
Besides, I doubt very much Mom's come up with a real disease to have a fund-raiser for.

97
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:51,652
I forgot-- we have a real disease. I chose it.

98
00:04:51,736 --> 00:04:54,976
G.V.H.: Graft Versus Host.

99
00:04:55,056 --> 00:04:58,083
It's new, it's fatal, and guess who's got it?

100
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,474
You've  heard of bodies rejecting transplants?

101
00:05:00,559 --> 00:05:04,011
Well, in this case, your transplanted hair is rejecting your body.

102
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:09,156
Either you remove your hair graft, or the host-- you-- will get sicker and eventually die.

103
00:05:09,255 --> 00:05:10,937
Can you think of any benefits?

104
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:12,699
Benefits? No. He'll die.

105
00:05:12,778 --> 00:05:16,990
Oh, yeah, no, I get that. But have there ever been any fund-raisers?

106
00:05:17,076 --> 00:05:19,776
A husband with the headlining disease.

107
00:05:19,854 --> 00:05:21,605
Everyone's going to want to talk to me.

108
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:22,828
You're making him keep the hair?

109
00:05:22,899 --> 00:05:25,393
Did you see the attention Superman's wife got?

110
00:05:25,501 --> 00:05:27,152
Besides,  Tobias wants it, too.

111
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,490
Oh, she's right. This is going to be great for me,

112
00:05:29,563 --> 00:05:32,813
because I'm going to star in the video Gob's making for the gala.

113
00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:35,575
Oh, yeah, it'll be very uplifting.

114
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,018
Oh, here, let me get that for you.

115
00:05:37,051 --> 00:05:38,048
Thank you.

116
00:05:38,221 --> 00:05:39,618
Oh! Oh! This is going hurt!

117
00:05:43,037 --> 00:05:45,281
You know what? We're going to need this from another angle.

118
00:05:45,335 --> 00:05:46,868
And you sure you're okay?

119
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:49,152
Oh, probably. I can't feel anything.

120
00:05:49,234 --> 00:05:50,266
How's my hair?

121
00:05:50,428 --> 00:05:53,412
It's fine. It's sucking the life out of you, Tobias.

122
00:05:53,492 --> 00:05:56,867
I mean, everything has gone crazy, the gala, Mom and Warden Gentles.

123
00:05:56,938 --> 00:05:59,404
I mean, what is in it for him? I think he's taking advantage of Mom.

124
00:05:59,473 --> 00:06:02,677
Did it ever occur to you that maybe Warden Gentiles likes her?

125
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:03,511
Likes her what?

126
00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:07,005
No, I mean, likes her. Like, is attracted to her.

127
00:06:07,092 --> 00:06:08,510
Who's the "her" in that sentence?

128
00:06:08,592 --> 00:06:11,296
Mom. Warden Gentles likes Mom.

129
00:06:11,758 --> 00:06:12,600
"Her?"

130
00:06:12,696 --> 00:06:14,330
I'm afraid I'm with Michael on this.

131
00:06:14,418 --> 00:06:17,307
The guy runs a prison, he can have any piece of ass he wants.

132
00:06:17,387 --> 00:06:20,091
And if he likes her in that sense, it makes it even worse.

133
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,516
I don't want Mom mixed up with the sort of creep that would have her as a fetish.

134
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:26,290
Oh, Michael, you're just feeling neglected by your mother.

135
00:06:26,376 --> 00:06:28,320
You wanted to go to this with her, didn't you?

136
00:06:28,403 --> 00:06:30,720
Hey, I don't need to take my mom to a gala, okay?

137
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,338
Only losers go to those things with their parents, I'm going with my son.

138
00:06:33,413 --> 00:06:35,475
Oh, I may skip that, I don't like galas.

139
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,438
Actually, he loved galas, all kids do.

140
00:06:38,517 --> 00:06:41,569
Oh, come on, don't leave your Uncle Teabag hanging.

141
00:06:41,632 --> 00:06:42,661
Please don't call yourself that.

142
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:46,686
What he was having trouble with was looking directly at his dying uncle.

143
00:06:46,769 --> 00:06:49,362
I can't stand by and watch Mom get hurt. I have to get down there.

144
00:06:50,761 --> 00:06:52,240
This is heartbreaking.

145
00:06:52,322 --> 00:06:54,141
Got to get this for the video.

146
00:06:54,654 --> 00:06:57,797
Hey, George Michael, you want to put your head down there by his drainage shunt.

147
00:06:57,877 --> 00:07:01,531
Buster, meanwhile, was also feeling abandoned by Mother.

148
00:07:03,111 --> 00:07:04,174
Mother!

149
00:07:04,922 --> 00:07:06,362
I have no one now.

150
00:07:06,442 --> 00:07:10,516
But at that very moment, his true father returned.

151
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:13,752
Uncle/Father Oscar? What are you doing here?

152
00:07:13,869 --> 00:07:15,489
Well, you know me.

153
00:07:15,883 --> 00:07:18,879
I could never leave a little bud behind.

154
00:07:19,181 --> 00:07:20,493
Oh, a hug. Nice.

155
00:07:20,577 --> 00:07:23,706
You haven't seen a little box with a turtle on it, have you?

156
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:27,711
Oh, yeah. My turtle was living in it before he ate all the grass and died.

157
00:07:27,783 --> 00:07:29,358
- He ate all the grass?
- Yeah.

158
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:31,743
- Well, it's been great catching up.
- Wait, wait, where are you going?

159
00:07:31,821 --> 00:07:34,972
No, I can't stay, because if my brother finds out that I'm here,

160
00:07:35,045 --> 00:07:38,137
he can try switching places again, and I can't go back to prison.

161
00:07:38,221 --> 00:07:39,391
Wait, wait, wait.

162
00:07:39,475 --> 00:07:41,621
If my father comes in, you can hide in one of Gob's tricks.

163
00:07:41,701 --> 00:07:42,241
I can't.

164
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:45,299
At least you can stay and help me bury my poor turtle.

165
00:07:45,445 --> 00:07:46,759
Or we could cremate it.

166
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:51,595
And Maeby was having a harder time finishing Warden Gentles' screenplay than he did.

167
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:52,688
You're a reader.

168
00:07:52,792 --> 00:07:54,417
How'd you like to read something fun that we could talk about

169
00:07:54,488 --> 00:07:55,995
on the way to the prison gala?

170
00:07:56,093 --> 00:07:58,487
Oh, I'm actually going to sit that out.

171
00:07:58,593 --> 00:08:00,213
I'm just burnt out on prisons lately.

172
00:08:00,309 --> 00:08:01,151
Well, this might change your mind.

173
00:08:01,236 --> 00:08:02,243
Is that a screenplay?

174
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:03,999
Well, that's what you're going to tell me.

175
00:08:04,737 --> 00:08:08,238
And Michael raced to warn his mother of the warden's intentions.

176
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,416
- You can't park there! No stair car parking!
- Sorry, I forgot.

177
00:08:14,605 --> 00:08:15,509
Sorry.

178
00:08:17,682 --> 00:08:19,656
Everything looks delicious.

179
00:08:19,748 --> 00:08:21,939
Oh,  One Eye's a wonderful chef.

180
00:08:22,029 --> 00:08:26,378
I've had to go to his parole hearings twice, and lie through my teeth to keep him here.

181
00:08:28,277 --> 00:08:30,774
Hi, I just, uh... Wow.

182
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,703
What are you guys doing?

183
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:34,930
It's perfectly innocent.

184
00:08:35,034 --> 00:08:37,262
But I can see how, if our roles were reversed,

185
00:08:37,332 --> 00:08:41,153
I might have you beaten with a pillowcase full of batteries.

186
00:08:41,232 --> 00:08:42,304
I'll give you two a moment.

187
00:08:42,382 --> 00:08:43,017
Thank you.

188
00:08:43,104 --> 00:08:45,660
I don't know why I always assume everyone's read my screenplay.

189
00:08:45,704 --> 00:08:47,044
What is wrong with you?

190
00:08:47,119 --> 00:08:49,459
That man is being wonderful to us.

191
00:08:49,545 --> 00:08:51,197
And that doesn't concern you, Mother?

192
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:53,085
For all you know, he could be trying to seduce you.

193
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,615
Oh, Michael, you're crazy.

194
00:08:54,702 --> 00:08:55,449
I certainly hope so.

195
00:08:55,546 --> 00:08:58,057
I'm trying to seduce him.

196
00:08:58,774 --> 00:09:00,444
Who's the "I" in that sentence?

197
00:09:00,592 --> 00:09:01,570
Me.

198
00:09:01,736 --> 00:09:02,754
You?

199
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,162
Her.

200
00:09:06,517 --> 00:09:10,652
Michael had just discovered that his mother was interested in another man.

201
00:09:10,749 --> 00:09:12,792
Mom wants to sleep with the warden.

202
00:09:12,831 --> 00:09:14,521
What? Oh, God!

203
00:09:14,705 --> 00:09:15,885
- Great.
- Great?

204
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:18,521
The man is old enough to be her contemporary, Lindsay.

205
00:09:18,608 --> 00:09:21,334
Plus, she's married, okay? She can't be writhing around underneath...

206
00:09:21,417 --> 00:09:22,871
What is wrong with you?!

207
00:09:22,953 --> 00:09:24,105
It's disgusting! God!

208
00:09:24,187 --> 00:09:25,002
Take it easy.

209
00:09:25,084 --> 00:09:27,879
No, it's just I've always had a thing about Mom and Dad being together.

210
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:30,294
- I know that.
- I have a sense of propriety, my God.

211
00:09:30,358 --> 00:09:31,618
Gob, we've had this conversation.

212
00:09:31,694 --> 00:09:32,617
When?

213
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:34,727
The last time you ended up seeing Mom and Dad go at it.

214
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:37,607
What? No, God, Michael... I did no such thing.

215
00:09:37,701 --> 00:09:39,486
He did very much that thing

216
00:09:39,573 --> 00:09:43,254
when his parents got intimate in the conjugal trailer two years ago.

217
00:09:43,344 --> 00:09:45,585
But, thankfully, he'd found a way to forget that.

218
00:09:45,671 --> 00:09:47,134
I've got a thing of pills in my pocket.

219
00:09:47,229 --> 00:09:49,722
I don't suppose I could convince you to grab me one?

220
00:09:50,406 --> 00:09:52,367
Luckily, that worked, too.

221
00:09:52,409 --> 00:09:53,579
I  can't even hear this.

222
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,833
You may not like it that Mom has needs,

223
00:09:55,924 --> 00:09:57,962
but it never bothered you when Dad was running around.

224
00:09:58,036 --> 00:09:59,520
Well, that was different.

225
00:09:59,594 --> 00:10:01,543
Well, how about when she was sleeping with Uncle Oscar?

226
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,888
The guy looks just like Dad. I don't know, he's family.

227
00:10:04,982 --> 00:10:06,309
It seemed very natural they'd be together.

228
00:10:06,392 --> 00:10:07,895
Ooh, what-what... what is natural?

229
00:10:07,978 --> 00:10:09,572
Is there new legislation on this now?

230
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:13,535
George Michael was concerned about family love after reading Maeby's script,

231
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:16,599
which he took as a subtle message to him from his cousin.

232
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:19,551
Listen, new fish, that bunk was open

233
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,833
because the last guy wouldn't do the things that you're going to do.

234
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:25,101
We're going to do things?

235
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,463
Anything can happen when two people share a cell, cuz.

236
00:10:28,693 --> 00:10:31,518
Um, I'll... I'll go with you to the prison.

237
00:10:31,606 --> 00:10:33,451
George Michael, what I want you to do is run upstairs

238
00:10:33,537 --> 00:10:35,536
and run a nice bath for Uncle Tobias,

239
00:10:35,621 --> 00:10:38,784
and I want you to help him get in the tub. Can you do that for me?

240
00:10:38,863 --> 00:10:39,439
Thanks.

241
00:10:39,518 --> 00:10:42,641
And don't make the water too hot-- the scabs come right off.

242
00:10:42,738 --> 00:10:44,507
So come on, Lindsay, what are we going to do about mother?

243
00:10:44,593 --> 00:10:47,279
Honestly, Michael, all this mother talk...

244
00:10:47,359 --> 00:10:49,565
you're starting to sound a lot like Buster.

245
00:10:49,645 --> 00:10:53,917
And Michael realized there was somebody else in the family that would care about this.

246
00:10:54,001 --> 00:10:55,939
Buster's going to take this so hard.

247
00:10:56,032 --> 00:10:57,710
I cannot let my brotherget hurt.

248
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,893
Oh, it's on "standby"!

249
00:11:08,117 --> 00:11:09,536
Got another one in you?

250
00:11:10,606 --> 00:11:13,521
Buster, meanwhile, was enjoying being with Oscar,

251
00:11:13,605 --> 00:11:16,195
but Oscar was longing for his sweet freedom.

252
00:11:16,268 --> 00:11:19,073
Say, you don't have any Sweet Freedom or Tropical Leaves,

253
00:11:19,162 --> 00:11:21,772
or  any of the Hawaiian blends, do you?

254
00:11:22,304 --> 00:11:23,810
Someone's coming!

255
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:27,114
Oh, get in the cage and hide behind the mirror, it'll look empty.

256
00:11:29,069 --> 00:11:32,607
Oscar never got a chance to hide behind the mirror.

257
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:37,077
Although, it wasn't the first time he'd been knocked out by a powerful lid.

258
00:11:37,369 --> 00:11:38,706
Hey, Buster, listen.

259
00:11:38,792 --> 00:11:41,200
I got some bad news about Mom.

260
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:44,267
She's planning on spending the night with another man.

261
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,209
Gob?

262
00:11:45,308 --> 00:11:46,945
No, not another brother.

263
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,514
Oh, then why do we care?

264
00:11:48,596 --> 00:11:50,816
What is wrong with everyone? Buster.

265
00:11:50,912 --> 00:11:53,178
You've got to talk to Mom about this. She can't possibly do it.

266
00:11:53,243 --> 00:11:54,651
If Dad finds out, he'll go berserk.

267
00:11:54,736 --> 00:11:56,255
Dad finds out about what?

268
00:11:56,535 --> 00:11:58,232
Well, I guess I've got no choice now.

269
00:11:58,316 --> 00:12:05,021
Dad, I've got some bad news about Mom and Warden Gentles... dating.

270
00:12:05,994 --> 00:12:07,348
Better sit down.

271
00:12:09,701 --> 00:12:11,338
Okay, what's the news?

272
00:12:11,412 --> 00:12:12,401
They're dating.

273
00:12:12,496 --> 00:12:15,851
Oh, yeah, because she's my wife. Oh, yeah, damn it.

274
00:12:15,931 --> 00:12:17,218
Surprised you're not more upset about this.

275
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,995
When you first told me. But you see, time passes.

276
00:12:20,076 --> 00:12:23,632
Besides, it's only dinner in the office. It's not Le Cirque.

277
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,054
How'd you know it was in his office?

278
00:12:25,142 --> 00:12:29,634
Well... where the hell else are they gonna go at 4:00 in the afternoon?

279
00:12:29,718 --> 00:12:31,423
It was around 4:00. You already know about this.

280
00:12:31,507 --> 00:12:33,256
- Come on. 
- You're up to something, right?

281
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:34,396
You both are.

282
00:12:34,496 --> 00:12:36,576
She's working the warden. You're making fake heads.

283
00:12:36,657 --> 00:12:37,702
You're planning an escape.

284
00:12:37,792 --> 00:12:39,938
How dare you. I ought to shave your head

285
00:12:40,031 --> 00:12:42,362
and make you sit under that camera all night, mister.

286
00:12:42,444 --> 00:12:45,923
Unbelievable. I was worried that this guy was gonna take advantage of Mom.

287
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,521
You both were taking advantage of him.

288
00:12:47,602 --> 00:12:51,107
I don't know why I work so damn hard to keep this family together.

289
00:12:51,195 --> 00:12:52,688
Michael, can I talk to you for one sec?

290
00:12:52,781 --> 00:12:55,652
And that's when George Sr. got a call from Lucille.

291
00:12:55,694 --> 00:12:58,853
P-2-2-5-2.

292
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,419
Howdy doody, that's it.

293
00:13:01,513 --> 00:13:04,829
Now you get back here so you can smuggle me out past the guards

294
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:06,669
before Michael starts blabbing.

295
00:13:06,758 --> 00:13:08,680
You know what? You can smuggle yourself out.

296
00:13:08,766 --> 00:13:11,088
You want to get away from me so bad, you're free.

297
00:13:11,184 --> 00:13:13,249
But I'm free, too, baby.

298
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:17,629
I'm staying in the conjugal trailer with the warden tonight.

299
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:19,790
Him?

300
00:13:21,138 --> 00:13:23,757
Hey. Why is there an ambulance out front?

301
00:13:23,828 --> 00:13:25,281
Honey, the car is here.

302
00:13:25,382 --> 00:13:28,339
Hey. Do you need a ride? You'll have to lie down.

303
00:13:28,423 --> 00:13:30,074
I'm not going. The whole thing is a scam.

304
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:34,000
Mom was just using that warden to try to get Dad out. She's not trying to seduce him at all.

305
00:13:34,095 --> 00:13:36,205
Oh, no, she is. She's spending the night with him.

306
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:39,589
She just called to ask me to bring her a tube of vag...

307
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,118
...table paste. Hi, George Michael.

308
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,056
You're going, too, huh?

309
00:13:43,134 --> 00:13:45,401
Yeah, I thought I would, um, just go with Maeby

310
00:13:45,484 --> 00:13:48,743
and support her through this whole Graft versus Host thing.

311
00:13:48,837 --> 00:13:51,824
And Michael himself was feeling a little like the host

312
00:13:51,907 --> 00:13:54,067
that the grafting family was rejecting.

313
00:13:54,558 --> 00:13:56,069
Great. Go.

314
00:13:56,176 --> 00:13:57,553
It's a very important cause.

315
00:13:58,449 --> 00:13:59,866
I'll just stay here and read.

316
00:13:59,943 --> 00:14:04,476
But this, too, would prove challenging, as the family had no books.

317
00:14:07,838 --> 00:14:09,400
Other than those.

318
00:14:09,573 --> 00:14:14,632
And that's when Michael got a glimpse into the warden's true intentions with his mother.

319
00:14:14,733 --> 00:14:18,815
You were just using me to get even with the man who broke out of your prison?

320
00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:21,215
That escape cost me my promotion.

321
00:14:21,295 --> 00:14:25,453
And you'll pay for the loss of $2,300 a year.

322
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,011
But you gave me presents.

323
00:14:27,094 --> 00:14:28,629
We made love.

324
00:14:28,736 --> 00:14:30,753
I've given you one last present.

325
00:14:30,889 --> 00:14:32,726
Enjoy the chlamydia, Lucille.

326
00:14:34,069 --> 00:14:37,080
Take this newly-diseased woman to the hole.

327
00:14:37,789 --> 00:14:40,269
I wish I'd read The Man Inside Me.

328
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:45,182
George Sr. needed to escape.

329
00:14:45,255 --> 00:14:48,617
But his handmade replica would never fool the cameras.

330
00:14:48,702 --> 00:14:53,513
So he searched through Gob's magic stuff to find something that might.

331
00:14:54,028 --> 00:14:55,891
Well, that was a freebie.

332
00:14:56,179 --> 00:14:58,518
Hey, Gob, glad you're here. I thought you'd be at the gala.

333
00:14:58,604 --> 00:15:01,098
Yeah, Dad made me move my stuff out of Buster's room.

334
00:15:01,186 --> 00:15:06,180
But only after hiding himself in the cage to get past the cops at the door.

335
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,323
Go.

336
00:15:07,463 --> 00:15:09,425
Mom's being set up. We have to get into that prison.

337
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,451
It's after lockdown.

338
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:12,442
Come on, Gob, you were gonna break out of this place once,

339
00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:13,722
I know you can help me break in.

340
00:15:13,816 --> 00:15:16,017
It's not a Jamba Juice, Michael.

341
00:15:16,094 --> 00:15:18,064
Shouldn't be that hard to break into.

342
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:23,525
And Buster returned, only to find no evidence of his Uncle/Father.

343
00:15:24,328 --> 00:15:25,863
Hey, Father/Uncle Dad.

344
00:15:25,903 --> 00:15:27,644
I was just bringing some juice for my pet.

345
00:15:27,729 --> 00:15:30,771
Wait a minute. You're not really smiling.

346
00:15:31,553 --> 00:15:32,695
I'm Oscar.

347
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:35,352
He  did it again. I told you he would.

348
00:15:35,437 --> 00:15:38,781
I can't go through this again. I can't be caged.

349
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:43,203
And Buster realized he needed to give his true father his freedom.

350
00:15:44,197 --> 00:15:47,180
But it was a freedom that didn't last long.

351
00:15:48,105 --> 00:15:50,554
And as the prison gala was underway,

352
00:15:50,652 --> 00:15:52,763
the guys arrived for their break in

353
00:15:52,845 --> 00:15:56,250
with the help of one of George Sr.'s instruments of escape.

354
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,775
You think this is gonna work?

355
00:15:57,851 --> 00:16:00,780
It's a jetpack, Michael. What could possibly go wrong?

356
00:16:02,025 --> 00:16:04,218
Now just make sure you tell me before you hit any buttons.

357
00:16:07,386 --> 00:16:09,902
Good. Now we know what the strap was for.

358
00:16:10,484 --> 00:16:12,054
- Okay. Under the crotch.
- Need a new plan. Yeah.

359
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,138
Wish I knew the layout of this place.

360
00:16:14,226 --> 00:16:16,730
Way ahead of you, Michael.

361
00:16:16,771 --> 00:16:20,506
Drew a map of it on my stomach. It's upside down, so it might be a little awkward.

362
00:16:20,566 --> 00:16:21,891
It was awkward.

363
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:24,200
I drew us. I think we're, like, right there.

364
00:16:24,259 --> 00:16:25,318
Hey, guys.

365
00:16:25,424 --> 00:16:27,756
If you're gonna party, you want to bring it inside?

366
00:16:28,601 --> 00:16:29,969
That was a freebie.

367
00:16:30,275 --> 00:16:32,156
Well, the new facility isn't so bad, huh?

368
00:16:32,248 --> 00:16:34,367
It's a lot like school, only it's air-conditioned.

369
00:16:34,509 --> 00:16:37,848
So I guess we can just, uh, just choose a cell to stay overnight in...

370
00:16:37,933 --> 00:16:41,605
Oh, great. You could take me through your thoughts about the screenplay, beat by beat.

371
00:16:41,702 --> 00:16:42,970
Sure, yeah.

372
00:16:43,082 --> 00:16:46,463
"Because anything can happen when two people share a cell, cuz."

373
00:16:47,383 --> 00:16:49,759
It's a line from New Warden.

374
00:16:49,851 --> 00:16:53,037
Oh. Oh! Okay, yeah.

375
00:16:53,151 --> 00:16:54,952
I don't know what I was worried about.

376
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:00,749
That would be the happiest moment George Michael would ever experience in his life.

377
00:17:01,711 --> 00:17:03,560
And the warden was happy, too.

378
00:17:03,643 --> 00:17:05,142
What a treat.

379
00:17:05,238 --> 00:17:09,422
The man who cost me my promotion ends up back in my care.

380
00:17:09,515 --> 00:17:15,045
And I don't think there's going to be an "I'm Oscar" website this time.

381
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:17,961
I think this time I'll do a podcast.

382
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:20,276
Graft versus Host.

383
00:17:20,377 --> 00:17:24,616
Sounds like a tennis match between Steffi Graf and Happy Days star Donny Host.

384
00:17:24,701 --> 00:17:25,520
It's Most.

385
00:17:25,614 --> 00:17:27,320
But it's far deadlier.

386
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,745
Hello, I'm Gob Bluth.

387
00:17:30,552 --> 00:17:34,223
As a magician, I can make a lot of things disappear.

388
00:17:34,327 --> 00:17:36,577
There are some things I can't make disappear.

389
00:17:36,677 --> 00:17:39,142
No, not that candy ball machine.

390
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:43,012
The disease G.V.H., without your help.

391
00:17:43,098 --> 00:17:44,551
This is Tobias.

392
00:17:44,649 --> 00:17:48,365
When Toby first came into the family, none of us much wanted him around.

393
00:17:48,459 --> 00:17:51,104
But that's because we couldn't see what was on the inside.

394
00:17:51,201 --> 00:17:54,445
But lately, that's all we've been able to see.

395
00:17:55,058 --> 00:17:57,341
But what was Tobias to do?

396
00:17:57,455 --> 00:17:59,736
Have his hair plugs removed?

397
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:03,913
The doctor says I'd be completely healed if I were to do that.

398
00:18:04,018 --> 00:18:05,621
He just needs his hair plugs out?!

399
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:07,694
Doctor says that's the cure.

400
00:18:07,792 --> 00:18:08,772
There's a cure?!

401
00:18:08,872 --> 00:18:11,752
No way. That horse hair is my ticket back into society.

402
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:15,129
You'll cut it after those idiots at the gala accept me as one of their own.

403
00:18:15,223 --> 00:18:17,833
We're giving money for this guy to keep his hair transplants?!

404
00:18:17,922 --> 00:18:20,636
I'd rather give to T.B.A.! This is bull ( bleep )!

405
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:23,312
The crowd began to grow unruly.

406
00:18:25,954 --> 00:18:30,864
And just as the prisoners had proven they could throw a gala as well as the rich,

407
00:18:30,963 --> 00:18:35,270
so the rich proved they could throw a riot just as well as the prisoners.

408
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:37,912
And Lucille was brought to the conjugal trailer.

409
00:18:37,999 --> 00:18:38,579
Mom.

410
00:18:38,667 --> 00:18:39,891
Michael, what are you doing?

411
00:18:39,973 --> 00:18:42,318
I cannot let you go through with this. You can't sleep with him.

412
00:18:42,395 --> 00:18:43,930
Oh, yes, I can.

413
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,708
I'm making up for the heartbreak your father has caused me.

414
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,152
He doesn't need me. You don't need me.

415
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,447
Of course I need you, Mom.

416
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,322
My heart is kind of broken, too.

417
00:18:53,407 --> 00:18:56,777
I've been kind of denying it lately, but, you know, it's just, I can't deal

418
00:18:56,859 --> 00:19:00,459
with the fact that my family's falling apart now that I really need you.

419
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,524
Oh, Michael, honey.

420
00:19:02,782 --> 00:19:04,864
I want to cry so bad.

421
00:19:05,606 --> 00:19:08,646
But I don't think I can spare the moisture.

422
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:10,357
Well, listen, here's...

423
00:19:12,016 --> 00:19:15,698
The problem is that Gentles doesn't really care for you.

424
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:17,375
He's just using you to get back at Dad for escaping,

425
00:19:17,457 --> 00:19:19,101
at least that's according to his screenplay.

426
00:19:19,197 --> 00:19:20,471
- You read it? 
- Yeah.

427
00:19:20,565 --> 00:19:23,181
Did you like the chlamydia thing? I gave him that.

428
00:19:23,266 --> 00:19:24,445
You gave him chlamydia?

429
00:19:24,544 --> 00:19:27,564
He had crabs, and I said, "You're gonna get laughs."

430
00:19:28,002 --> 00:19:29,295
Then what am I doing?

431
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:36,074
If Dad doesn't care, there's no real threat. And, I guess, just knock yourself out.

432
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:38,035
Where's Gentles?! I'll kill him!

433
00:19:38,313 --> 00:19:39,488
- George? 
- Dad?

434
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:40,564
I can't let you do this!

435
00:19:40,667 --> 00:19:45,814
I can't let what we have, as lousy as it may be at times, be destroyed.

436
00:19:46,215 --> 00:19:49,746
This is where you escaped to? To prison? For me?

437
00:19:49,845 --> 00:19:52,359
No one is breaking this family apart, no one.

438
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:55,156
You know what? I think I needed to hear that.

439
00:19:55,756 --> 00:19:58,001
Sorry about the wait. George?

440
00:19:58,097 --> 00:20:01,810
If you're here, who do we have in the delousing tank?

441
00:20:01,898 --> 00:20:03,352
I'm guessing Oscar.

442
00:20:03,606 --> 00:20:04,547
No.

443
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:07,143
I cannot take another $2,300 hit.

444
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:08,153
I'll tell you what.

445
00:20:08,231 --> 00:20:12,413
You let Oscar out, and you give us an hour in here, and...

446
00:20:13,936 --> 00:20:15,509
we'll call it even.

447
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,029
Please, Ward?

448
00:20:18,127 --> 00:20:22,606
I can't say no to the woman who gave me chlamydia.

449
00:20:22,879 --> 00:20:23,830
One hour.

450
00:20:27,295 --> 00:20:29,113
We ready to have some fun?

451
00:20:29,246 --> 00:20:32,045
I'm so glad I didn't cry.

452
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:33,857
That I didn't need to hear.

453
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:38,385
On the next... Arrested Development...

454
00:20:38,506 --> 00:20:41,017
George Michael gets closer to his family.

455
00:20:43,118 --> 00:20:44,852
That was close, huh, Maeby?

456
00:20:45,571 --> 00:20:47,116
Oh, she's in the next cell.

457
00:20:47,207 --> 00:20:50,092
Looks like we're gonna be sharing a cell all night, cuz.

458
00:20:50,435 --> 00:20:54,923
George Michael experiences his unhappiest moment ever.

459
00:20:55,492 --> 00:20:58,625
Buster tries to forget his recent losses

460
00:21:00,184 --> 00:21:02,786
by breaking out the old guitar.

461
00:21:02,896 --> 00:21:06,461
And Gob finally faces a phobia he'd faced before.

462
00:21:06,484 --> 00:21:07,543
No! Not here!

463
00:21:07,637 --> 00:21:09,950
Wait. I've seen this before.

464
00:21:10,097 --> 00:21:12,184
Oh, God, I've seen this before!

465
00:21:12,277 --> 00:21:15,408
