1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,239
It's Arrested Development...

2
00:00:05,727 --> 00:00:10,887
Michael had snuck out of work to see a British film with his British girlfriend, Rita...

3
00:00:10,938 --> 00:00:14,505
I hate it when they hire Yanks to play Brits. You can always tell.

4
00:00:14,963 --> 00:00:17,317
...when they came upon a toy store.

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,202
We should get George Michael one of these.

6
00:00:20,318 --> 00:00:22,236
Oh, no, that's not really him.

7
00:00:22,244 --> 00:00:24,528
Besides, I already got him his big present for his birthday.

8
00:00:24,632 --> 00:00:25,649
A suit!

9
00:00:25,753 --> 00:00:27,053
Dad, it's a Jack Welch!

10
00:00:27,143 --> 00:00:28,561
I want you to look under the pants.

11
00:00:30,204 --> 00:00:31,874
Quicken! Premier!

12
00:00:31,976 --> 00:00:33,404
Dad, I hope you kept the receipt.

13
00:00:33,494 --> 00:00:34,411
You want to return that?

14
00:00:34,504 --> 00:00:36,034
What? No, I want to deduct it.

15
00:00:37,124 --> 00:00:39,474
Oh, come on, let's get him the train.

16
00:00:39,598 --> 00:00:42,675
It's... really, he would only like it for the receipt. And this is crazy,

17
00:00:42,749 --> 00:00:46,057
I, really... I can't be seeing movies in the afternoon and then go into toy stores.

18
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:48,326
I have to work. I'm not even supposed to be here.

19
00:00:48,434 --> 00:00:50,865
Michael couldn't tear himself away.

20
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:52,699
Could you?

21
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:55,126
I can't promise it'll be fun.

22
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:03,448
Okay... that was fun.

23
00:01:03,592 --> 00:01:06,668
Still, the land probably shouldn't have given out underneath us.

24
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:08,278
But, we've got a mole problem.

25
00:01:09,218 --> 00:01:10,712
A mole problem?

26
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,391
Yeah, they've undermined this whole hill,

27
00:01:12,467 --> 00:01:14,249
and we probably won't be able to build on it for a few months.

28
00:01:14,337 --> 00:01:17,172
But it's my own fault-- this is exactly why I should have been coming to work.

29
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,589
The Japanese backers, if they find out about this, that we haven't started building,

30
00:01:20,662 --> 00:01:22,647
they might not come through with their investments.

31
00:01:22,754 --> 00:01:24,041
I won't tattle.

32
00:01:24,934 --> 00:01:26,630
I really fancy you.

33
00:01:27,748 --> 00:01:29,552
I fancy you, too.

34
00:01:29,876 --> 00:01:32,298
Michael was falling for Rita.

35
00:01:33,813 --> 00:01:34,529
Whoo!

36
00:01:34,631 --> 00:01:37,032
And Rita was falling for Michael, too.

37
00:01:37,411 --> 00:01:39,806
But that wasn't part of the plan.

38
00:01:40,376 --> 00:01:41,258
Rita.

39
00:01:41,562 --> 00:01:43,258
You've dirt on your face.

40
00:01:43,725 --> 00:01:44,805
It's from school.

41
00:01:44,899 --> 00:01:47,036
I called the school, and you weren't there.

42
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,003
You know, we're here to learn things, not to fall in love.

43
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:52,137
Well, so what if I have.

44
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,527
I've got feelings, all right? I'm a woman, too.

45
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:59,271
Not some robot you get to tell everything to! I'm sick of it!

46
00:01:59,363 --> 00:02:01,010
I'm sick of it all!

47
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:03,661
Your instructions! And your letters!

48
00:02:03,754 --> 00:02:07,421
And your little missions! And your stupid assignments--

49
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,843
"You do the math, Rita." Well, no, you do the math!

50
00:02:11,018 --> 00:02:11,974
Oh, God.

51
00:02:12,064 --> 00:02:13,374
Do you remember this?

52
00:02:13,829 --> 00:02:16,134
And the pledge that you made when you were promised it?

53
00:02:16,225 --> 00:02:18,077
I said I'd do anything for it.

54
00:02:18,168 --> 00:02:20,749
I want him out of the picture. Can you do that?

55
00:02:20,835 --> 00:02:22,536
I'm a big girl.

56
00:02:28,524 --> 00:02:30,976
And Michael returned home as well.

57
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:32,429
Hey, what happened to you?

58
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,245
Oh, I got highlights.

59
00:02:34,338 --> 00:02:35,954
It'll blend in in about a week.

60
00:02:36,265 --> 00:02:38,344
Yeah, I actually meant the collapse.

61
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:39,079
Oh, I don't know.

62
00:02:39,172 --> 00:02:43,034
It probably has something to do with the 4,000 hair plugs I had in one sitting.

63
00:02:43,112 --> 00:02:44,376
Maybe you ought to see a doctor.

64
00:02:44,468 --> 00:02:47,912
Yeah, but he's too busy going to the gym to see his friend, Frank.

65
00:02:47,983 --> 00:02:49,613
Oh, we're more than friends.

66
00:02:49,706 --> 00:02:51,246
I'm kind of his spotter.

67
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,665
You missed a spot.

68
00:02:52,775 --> 00:02:56,283
Anyway, we should be looking at some big yen coming in from the Japanese.

69
00:02:56,283 --> 00:03:00,378
And when it does, I'm taking my gym buddy out to dinner--

70
00:03:00,492 --> 00:03:02,068
I barely even know you!

71
00:03:02,312 --> 00:03:03,644
Who's Frank?

72
00:03:03,735 --> 00:03:06,758
Well, I've been wanting to talk to you about that, but it's a little awkward.

73
00:03:06,852 --> 00:03:08,368
Oh, well...

74
00:03:08,494 --> 00:03:11,106
I've been wanting to have my own awkward talk as well.

75
00:03:11,197 --> 00:03:14,222
I think we can be more than just gym buddies.

76
00:03:15,032 --> 00:03:16,776
You're blowing my mind, Frank.

77
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,818
I'm an agent, and I'd like to work with you.

78
00:03:20,196 --> 00:03:22,433
Oh. Oh...

79
00:03:22,524 --> 00:03:24,786
Well, this is great news, okay, good.

80
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,515
I'm so glad you went first. What agency are you with?

81
00:03:27,602 --> 00:03:33,782
Frank said "CIA," a government agency that was responsible for this catastrophe.

82
00:03:33,868 --> 00:03:36,486
But Tobias thought he said "CAA,"

83
00:03:36,578 --> 00:03:39,331
a talent agency which was responsible for this one.

84
00:03:39,405 --> 00:03:41,034
Frank's in the business, Michael.

85
00:03:41,134 --> 00:03:44,122
He's got a big project for me. Says it's "top secret."

86
00:03:44,213 --> 00:03:48,038
He kind of looks like you. Same size. Same curly hair.

87
00:03:48,122 --> 00:03:50,926
Well Tobias, maybe you should spend less time focused on your looks

88
00:03:51,006 --> 00:03:53,220
and a little bit more time focused on your daughter, okay?

89
00:03:53,294 --> 00:03:55,780
Her grades are terrible. She's going to start getting "F's."

90
00:03:55,871 --> 00:03:58,032
Actually, she had already gotten one,

91
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:03,855
as the movie she'd released in her secret life as a studio executive was losing money.

92
00:04:03,938 --> 00:04:05,946
But Maeby had a way to fix that.

93
00:04:06,048 --> 00:04:07,628
We turn it into a ride.

94
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,516
A ride?

95
00:04:08,596 --> 00:04:09,878
On the Studio Tour.

96
00:04:09,962 --> 00:04:13,157
What used to be the "Hell Tunnel," now becomes...

97
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,031
the "Tunnel of Love, Indubitably."

98
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:18,063
But didn't some people die in Hell Tunnel?

99
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:19,715
That is an urban legend.

100
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:24,828
Two elderly people got badly scalded when they tried to climb into the lava cauldron.

101
00:04:24,911 --> 00:04:26,784
But I've got that covered.

102
00:04:27,112 --> 00:04:28,881
They're just like the poster!

103
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:32,151
Grades like those, she's going to be taking tickets at a movie theater the rest of her life.

104
00:04:32,245 --> 00:04:33,761
You know, you're one to talk.

105
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:37,546
You've completely ignored this family since that British bird flew into your life.

106
00:04:37,629 --> 00:04:38,767
No, I haven't.

107
00:04:38,855 --> 00:04:40,555
Well... maybe a little.

108
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:42,140
But, you, know, she's amazing.

109
00:04:42,222 --> 00:04:43,555
You know she was in the Olympics?

110
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,389
She wasn't.

111
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,010
She's that Rita Leeds?

112
00:04:46,094 --> 00:04:47,859
Wasn't she on the cover of Newsweek?

113
00:04:47,932 --> 00:04:48,544
No.

114
00:04:48,624 --> 00:04:49,123
Yes.

115
00:04:49,213 --> 00:04:51,558
Michael was thinking of this man.

116
00:04:51,695 --> 00:04:53,104
She even plays the banjo.

117
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,319
Although, I do have to spend more time at work.

118
00:04:55,412 --> 00:04:57,793
I was at the property the Japanese funded today,

119
00:04:57,874 --> 00:05:00,265
and the whole backside has moles.

120
00:05:00,358 --> 00:05:02,014
Yeah, that's Frank's problem, too.

121
00:05:03,097 --> 00:05:07,973
Later that day, Michael went into the office to find the rest of his family.

122
00:05:08,062 --> 00:05:10,713
Well, look who's finally gracing us with his presence.

123
00:05:10,798 --> 00:05:12,292
What's a surrogate doing here?

124
00:05:12,394 --> 00:05:13,459
We're meeting with the lawyers...

125
00:05:13,557 --> 00:05:15,898
So I've hired this guy to be my eyes and ears.

126
00:05:15,988 --> 00:05:17,828
You know, Dad, this guy costs us a fortune.

127
00:05:17,912 --> 00:05:19,295
He's worth every penny.

128
00:05:19,405 --> 00:05:20,894
Hey, I didn't say that.

129
00:05:20,994 --> 00:05:22,667
- Oh, Michael!
- Mr. Loblaw.

130
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,951
I'll catch you up. The Japanese are coming.

131
00:05:25,037 --> 00:05:25,603
They are?

132
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:28,223
Somebody tipped them off that the property wasn't ready for building.

133
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,219
Which it would have been if Michael hadn't been so busy with his...

134
00:05:31,301 --> 00:05:32,323
English muffin.

135
00:05:32,418 --> 00:05:33,984
- Typical.
- Delicious.

136
00:05:34,089 --> 00:05:35,332
I need a drink.

137
00:05:35,436 --> 00:05:37,019
I'll take an English muffin.

138
00:05:37,108 --> 00:05:39,464
We'll just have to be honest with these Japanese investors.

139
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,745
They, uh, come from a culture that values honor and respect.

140
00:05:42,831 --> 00:05:44,081
And Godzilla!

141
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,268
God-zirra!

142
00:05:50,747 --> 00:05:52,005
God-zirra!

143
00:05:53,939 --> 00:05:56,254
This needs to stop now.

144
00:05:56,919 --> 00:05:59,775
This is exactly what we shouldn't do when they show up.

145
00:06:00,542 --> 00:06:02,135
- Mom, that's enough.
- What?

146
00:06:02,246 --> 00:06:04,090
- We're out of vodka.
- Sorry.

147
00:06:04,178 --> 00:06:05,745
Thought you were doing Godzilla.

148
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,917
Mom, that's enough.

149
00:06:08,004 --> 00:06:09,664
What-- I'm laughing.

150
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:10,812
Okay, maybe that's it.

151
00:06:10,885 --> 00:06:13,729
Maybe we should do to the Japanese what they do in their movies:

152
00:06:13,829 --> 00:06:16,088
build a miniature city. Put it outside the window.

153
00:06:16,185 --> 00:06:18,872
Tell them it's far away. It'll look real if you squint.

154
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,765
God knows they're squinters.

155
00:06:20,858 --> 00:06:22,302
What do you think, Dad?

156
00:06:22,437 --> 00:06:25,690
A whole... tiny town?

157
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:27,964
Another brilliant idea, Einstein.

158
00:06:28,078 --> 00:06:29,235
Really?

159
00:06:29,351 --> 00:06:31,062
You'd like to build it with me?

160
00:06:31,186 --> 00:06:33,851
Larry really never knows how to sell the sarcasm.

161
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,485
It's a stupid idea.

162
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:38,131
Uh... I'll build it with you, Gob.

163
00:06:38,227 --> 00:06:41,846
Oh, great. That's another brilliant idea, Steinberg.

164
00:06:41,945 --> 00:06:43,021
I agree with Michael.

165
00:06:43,118 --> 00:06:46,589
If you take money from these people under false pretenses, you'll be committing fraud.

166
00:06:46,671 --> 00:06:49,256
The government's already watching your father pretty closely.

167
00:06:49,345 --> 00:06:50,524
They're going through his mail.

168
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:52,398
They want to put your father in prison for good.

169
00:06:52,467 --> 00:06:54,930
Yeah, Bob's right. We've got to start thinking practically.

170
00:06:55,008 --> 00:06:58,253
Life is not some cheesy Japanese movie

171
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,452
where the hero pulls on a pair of jet pants...

172
00:07:00,534 --> 00:07:02,982
And flies off the balcony like Astro Boy.

173
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:07,400
And that's when George Sr. did a Web search for the words "jet pants."

174
00:07:08,085 --> 00:07:09,412
Even better.

175
00:07:09,492 --> 00:07:11,868
The bigger problem is, who alerted the Japanese?

176
00:07:11,954 --> 00:07:13,380
I think you might have a spy.

177
00:07:13,481 --> 00:07:17,266
This room, or someone in it, might even be wired with a listening device.

178
00:07:20,564 --> 00:07:23,107
And you need to find that leak and plug it.

179
00:07:23,205 --> 00:07:25,577
Your father said that he was set up by a British syndicate.

180
00:07:25,676 --> 00:07:27,490
Maybe you should look for somebody English.

181
00:07:30,038 --> 00:07:31,036
What?

182
00:07:31,134 --> 00:07:34,027
I think Michael's already plugged our leak.

183
00:07:34,127 --> 00:07:35,315
What is that supposed to mean?

184
00:07:35,408 --> 00:07:38,460
You've been spending a lot of time with Rita, and she's British-ish.

185
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,163
She's a spy!

186
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,789
I haven't told Rita anything.

187
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,956
This was not strictly true.

188
00:07:44,043 --> 00:07:45,992
Let's start with my family's misdemeanors,

189
00:07:46,074 --> 00:07:49,344
and then we're going to push right on through to the lighter treasons.

190
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:52,789
The Japanese backers, if they find out about this, that we haven't started building,

191
00:07:52,877 --> 00:07:54,627
they might not come through with their investments.

192
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:57,853
Then he siphoned off the entire pension fund into a dummy corporation,

193
00:07:57,955 --> 00:08:00,190
filed for bankruptcy and used...

194
00:08:00,277 --> 00:08:01,621
Do you know any other songs?

195
00:08:01,725 --> 00:08:03,093
She's a spy!

196
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:05,908
Rita is not a spy, okay? She's a beautiful, elegant woman.

197
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:06,947
It doesn't make sense.

198
00:08:07,027 --> 00:08:08,870
What doesn't make any sense is why she's dating you.

199
00:08:08,944 --> 00:08:10,005
No, that's a good point.

200
00:08:10,094 --> 00:08:13,629
Actually my sources tell me that the leak goes by the name "Mr. F."

201
00:08:13,999 --> 00:08:15,811
Ah. "Mr. F."

202
00:08:15,887 --> 00:08:16,711
Rita's not a man.

203
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:17,750
As far as you know.

204
00:08:17,841 --> 00:08:19,313
And it could be an alias.

205
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,099
Alias is a show about a spy!

206
00:08:22,196 --> 00:08:24,405
All right, that's it. I finally find someone that I really care about,

207
00:08:24,491 --> 00:08:26,841
my family tries to drive us apart. It's not going to work.

208
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:29,033
So, you know what? I got a switch for you--

209
00:08:29,122 --> 00:08:32,918
you guys handle this problem, I am going to go have some fun.

210
00:08:33,636 --> 00:08:34,946
Unbelievable.

211
00:08:35,033 --> 00:08:37,277
Deserting the family when we most need him.

212
00:08:37,366 --> 00:08:38,356
Shameful.

213
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,976
Gob, I'm sending you a package. You'll know what to do with it.

214
00:08:42,484 --> 00:08:44,081
Michael was upset,

215
00:08:44,178 --> 00:08:45,604
and he called Rita.

216
00:08:45,717 --> 00:08:46,604
Hello?

217
00:08:46,687 --> 00:08:48,878
Hey. I've been thinking.

218
00:08:48,979 --> 00:08:52,848
I'm going to start working less, and I do want to start having more fun.

219
00:08:52,937 --> 00:08:55,394
So, I'd like to take you out tomorrow.

220
00:08:55,484 --> 00:08:57,946
All day, anywhere you want. What do you say?

221
00:08:58,017 --> 00:08:59,565
"Hell Tunnel" takes another name.

222
00:08:59,657 --> 00:09:01,457
Will it take another life?

223
00:09:01,543 --> 00:09:03,245
Oh, I say yes.

224
00:09:04,314 --> 00:09:07,207
Only I'm going to take you out.

225
00:09:09,689 --> 00:09:13,158
The next morning, Michael was heading out for his day with Rita.

226
00:09:13,169 --> 00:09:14,937
- George Michael.
- I love my present, Dad.

227
00:09:15,026 --> 00:09:17,096
I'd wear it to school, but who needs a "Welch wedge," right?

228
00:09:17,285 --> 00:09:18,821
- That's when they...
- Enough business.

229
00:09:18,832 --> 00:09:22,749
In fact, I got you another present. It's something I saw yesterday when I was out with Rita.

230
00:09:22,844 --> 00:09:24,459
It's time for us to start having some fun.

231
00:09:24,544 --> 00:09:27,448
I don't know... "Fun" and "Failure" both start out the same way.

232
00:09:29,281 --> 00:09:31,960
Well, let's just go ahead and rip this down. Hmm?

233
00:09:36,771 --> 00:09:40,649
And Larry the surrogate showed up to pick up the jet pack

234
00:09:40,735 --> 00:09:43,456
that George Sr. had sent to the model home.

235
00:09:43,506 --> 00:09:45,266
What is that, a train set?

236
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,547
Look down, Larry.

237
00:09:46,638 --> 00:09:48,628
No, not down at your feet.

238
00:09:48,648 --> 00:09:49,679
Left.

239
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:51,550
My left, your right.

240
00:09:51,631 --> 00:09:54,366
What is the matter with this guy? And, let me guess, he's probably...

241
00:09:54,432 --> 00:09:56,074
Saying all that, too.

242
00:09:56,309 --> 00:10:00,265
It is a train set. Those Japanese sites.

243
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:03,757
- I'm never going to find my way...
- Past that hallway sensor.

244
00:10:03,887 --> 00:10:05,511
Dad, what are you doing here?

245
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,324
Is this the package you sent me?

246
00:10:09,491 --> 00:10:10,863
Tiny town!

247
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:13,529
This is for tiny town, isn't it!

248
00:10:13,676 --> 00:10:16,604
You did like my idea, didn't you, Dad?

249
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:18,780
I think he's in the can.

250
00:10:18,901 --> 00:10:20,740
Actually, George Sr. was in the kitchen

251
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,218
trying to soothe himself with an ice cream sandwich.

252
00:10:27,607 --> 00:10:32,545
And that's when he discovered a way to possibly slip by the sensors.

253
00:10:32,668 --> 00:10:36,037
If mother sees this, she will blow a cow.

254
00:10:40,392 --> 00:10:41,459
Uh-oh.

255
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:42,655
Dad.

256
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,324
Oh, cool, a train set.

257
00:10:46,405 --> 00:10:48,222
Oh, I've always wanted one of those.

258
00:10:48,344 --> 00:10:50,976
Maybe we could build our tiny town together.

259
00:10:51,697 --> 00:10:53,254
Do you want to, dad?

260
00:10:53,281 --> 00:10:56,535
Buster had always wanted to do the same with Gob.

261
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:59,941
Goody, yeah. I do want to.

262
00:11:00,051 --> 00:11:02,724
Yay, I do want to. Goody.

263
00:11:03,311 --> 00:11:06,389
Gob was thrilled, as was Buster.

264
00:11:06,504 --> 00:11:08,254
Only Larry was disappointed.

265
00:11:08,366 --> 00:11:11,263
But he was such a pro, you'd never know it.

266
00:11:11,397 --> 00:11:14,016
And back at the gym, Tobias was finding out more

267
00:11:14,115 --> 00:11:16,532
about the project the agent had suggested.

268
00:11:16,622 --> 00:11:19,641
Come on, what are you gonna tell me? What do you got for me?

269
00:11:19,735 --> 00:11:22,858
The Japanese investors you told us about are going over to your place today.

270
00:11:22,945 --> 00:11:24,506
I need you there when they are.

271
00:11:24,608 --> 00:11:26,409
We need you to be a mole.

272
00:11:26,651 --> 00:11:31,121
Oh, kind of a backer's audition. Okay, I get it, all right.

273
00:11:31,198 --> 00:11:36,680
Well, then, Frank, I shall be a bigger, hairier mole than the one on your inner left thigh.

274
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:41,885
And later, Michael and Rita were on the Tantamount Studios tour.

275
00:11:41,963 --> 00:11:44,595
...he doesn't understand about bovine sponge...

276
00:11:44,721 --> 00:11:46,776
Hold, hold! Tram! Let's get out of here, folks!

277
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,409
Make some room! Make some room!

278
00:11:48,544 --> 00:11:50,332
Look, it's Malcolm in the Middle.

279
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,368
In the middle of shooting, I guess.

280
00:11:52,456 --> 00:11:54,660
Oh, that's okay. It's more important to show

281
00:11:54,694 --> 00:11:56,905
how we make the show than to actually make it.

282
00:11:58,147 --> 00:11:59,859
( bleep ) Tantamount.

283
00:12:00,648 --> 00:12:01,243
Hello?

284
00:12:01,328 --> 00:12:04,903
Hey, Dad, they just dropped off the package you sent, but I don't think I'm old enough.

285
00:12:04,989 --> 00:12:07,652
Of course you are. I told you I want you to have a little fun.

286
00:12:07,737 --> 00:12:09,144
You're not gonna break anything.

287
00:12:09,249 --> 00:12:12,565
But of course, Michael thought he was talking about the train set.

288
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:17,122
Not the extremely dangerous jet pack the boy had just found at the front door.

289
00:12:17,217 --> 00:12:18,388
Well, what if I crash it?

290
00:12:18,472 --> 00:12:20,047
That's half the fun.

291
00:12:20,893 --> 00:12:26,083
And soon... the tour arrived at the Tunnel of Love, Indubitably...

292
00:12:26,188 --> 00:12:29,342
So take the hand of someone you love

293
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:33,066
as we enter the Tunnel of Love, Indubitably--

294
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,354
Tunnel of Hell!

295
00:12:35,207 --> 00:12:39,977
But Michael was happy to hold the hand of someone he did love.

296
00:12:40,387 --> 00:12:42,669
And then he noticed her bracelet--

297
00:12:46,609 --> 00:12:51,693
Michael had just noticed that Rita was wearing a suspicious bracelet.

298
00:12:52,001 --> 00:12:53,741
What does your bracelet say?

299
00:12:54,514 --> 00:12:55,247
Nothing.

300
00:12:55,337 --> 00:12:58,948
Oh, look, look! There they are on the bicycle made for two.

301
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:01,330
Says Mr. F, doesn't it? Who is he?

302
00:13:01,425 --> 00:13:04,414
Nobody... I can't tell you!

303
00:13:05,163 --> 00:13:07,341
Oh, God. He followed us.

304
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,535
Wait a minute. You know that man?

305
00:13:10,631 --> 00:13:12,949
It's not what you think it is. He's my uncle.

306
00:13:13,037 --> 00:13:14,511
Is that Mr. F? What does he want?

307
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,348
He wants you out of the picture.

308
00:13:16,446 --> 00:13:17,754
Bloody right, I do!

309
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:18,770
Hey, hey!

310
00:13:21,621 --> 00:13:22,764
You lied to me, Rita.

311
00:13:22,847 --> 00:13:25,404
You made me turn against my family, but it's over now.

312
00:13:28,052 --> 00:13:30,298
Oh! Me ( bleep ) are wet.

313
00:13:31,617 --> 00:13:35,348
And Maeby received a call about the latest lava cauldron accident.

314
00:13:35,435 --> 00:13:37,613
Already? It's only been an hour.

315
00:13:37,767 --> 00:13:39,442
I'm going to lose this job.

316
00:13:39,538 --> 00:13:41,190
Maybe I should let Mort take me out to dinner.

317
00:13:41,207 --> 00:13:42,242
Maeby!

318
00:13:42,392 --> 00:13:44,800
Okay, I'm definitely gonna lose this job-- I can explain.

319
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:46,260
Rita set me up, set us all up.

320
00:13:46,345 --> 00:13:49,367
This beautiful, funny, brilliant woman was a spy.

321
00:13:49,456 --> 00:13:52,469
Everybody was right, it was too good to be true! And I am turning her in.

322
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,808
Let me tell you something else.

323
00:13:53,892 --> 00:13:56,399
I would not want to be the next woman who tries to fool me.

324
00:13:58,962 --> 00:14:00,830
Well, that was a freebie.

325
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:05,487
George Michael, meanwhile, was trying to solve a mystery of his own.

326
00:14:06,309 --> 00:14:09,477
The jet pack had come with an instructional DVD

327
00:14:09,575 --> 00:14:12,866
that seemed to confuse more than clarify.

328
00:14:13,049 --> 00:14:16,991
What was clear was that the gift was extremely dangerous.

329
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,083
And it did seem like a lot of work...

330
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:30,660
for a little pay off.

331
00:14:32,145 --> 00:14:33,750
- Have fun!
- Have fun!

332
00:14:33,837 --> 00:14:37,743
Meanwhile, Gob was bonding with the man he thought his father was controlling.

333
00:14:37,831 --> 00:14:40,044
Almost done with the water tower.

334
00:14:40,451 --> 00:14:41,643
Neat-o.

335
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:46,972
His real father, however, had gotten lost within the walls.

336
00:14:47,081 --> 00:14:48,178
Where the hell am I?

337
00:14:48,266 --> 00:14:52,039
He was actually somewhere between the linen closet and the guest room.

338
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,526
You know, I'm really glad that we're doing this together.

339
00:14:54,635 --> 00:14:56,237
I've never felt so close to you.

340
00:14:56,343 --> 00:14:58,636
Oh, I feel the same way.

341
00:14:58,971 --> 00:15:00,491
He's crying now.

342
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:02,289
God, look at us.

343
00:15:02,391 --> 00:15:05,422
We're like a couple of girls on the last day of camp!

344
00:15:07,847 --> 00:15:09,732
And right outside the house,

345
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:13,289
Tobias was working with the man he thought was a talent agent.

346
00:15:13,369 --> 00:15:13,953
You ready?

347
00:15:14,035 --> 00:15:16,382
Oh, yes, I'm going to be a great mole.

348
00:15:16,506 --> 00:15:17,694
Check, two, three.

349
00:15:17,787 --> 00:15:20,177
Let Lily lick Lionels lusty leathers...

350
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,870
The levels are fine.

351
00:15:21,989 --> 00:15:25,253
Remember, no one can know it's you. We need to capture George Sr.

352
00:15:25,349 --> 00:15:27,052
Capture George Sr.?

353
00:15:27,149 --> 00:15:29,353
Is that what you hired me to do?

354
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,823
You didn't realize that?

355
00:15:30,913 --> 00:15:32,034
No.

356
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:35,475
But it does make perfect sense. I have played him before.

357
00:15:35,532 --> 00:15:40,053
He had, in the poorly narrated reality series Scandalmakers.

358
00:15:40,162 --> 00:15:41,993
It's gonna be tough to work that into the character,

359
00:15:42,097 --> 00:15:44,180
and it's going to fight the costume I rented,

360
00:15:44,271 --> 00:15:48,432
but I didn't take six weeks of improv classes at the Groundlings for nothing.

361
00:15:49,341 --> 00:15:52,391
And Michael was on the phone to Bob Loblaw.

362
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:54,358
I don't even think she's here legally, all right?

363
00:15:54,447 --> 00:15:57,609
She's taken advantage of me. I want you to take care of this.

364
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,594
Call the CIA, do whatever you have to do.

365
00:15:59,683 --> 00:16:01,492
Fine, but you take care of your family.

366
00:16:01,579 --> 00:16:03,334
I think they're going ahead with this hoax.

367
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:06,568
And if money changes hands, you're all going to jail.

368
00:16:06,658 --> 00:16:10,091
Unfortunately the roads are out, so we can't take you up there to see it in person,

369
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:14,027
but if you stand absolutely still right there, and just...

370
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:17,516
squint into the light and behold "Sudden Hill!"

371
00:16:17,607 --> 00:16:18,719
Gob, don't!

372
00:16:19,851 --> 00:16:21,912
It actually looked pretty good.

373
00:16:21,995 --> 00:16:24,399
Even the financiers thought so.

374
00:16:24,482 --> 00:16:28,866
Ishiro said, "I am reassured." and "They treat us with respect this time."

375
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:32,937
Motoyoshi said, "I thought the woman was pretending as a monster,

376
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:35,207
but she was just out of vodka."

377
00:16:35,321 --> 00:16:39,380
Let's go ahead and close the curtains and not accept any money while we're ahead.

378
00:16:39,422 --> 00:16:43,177
So as you can see, any rumor of a mole problem is completely untrue.

379
00:16:43,288 --> 00:16:49,127
But unfortunately, this was just as Tobias appeared in his rented mole outfit.

380
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:52,358
- No! The village!
- Families should come-- ow!

381
00:16:52,641 --> 00:16:53,533
Ow!

382
00:16:53,623 --> 00:16:56,702
I'm very particular about building codes.

383
00:16:57,753 --> 00:17:01,053
And this water tower does not pass muster.

384
00:17:01,172 --> 00:17:02,991
Who can save our village?

385
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:09,850
As it turns out, it was George Michael who had finally gotten his grandfather's jet pack to work.

386
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:17,794
I can't stop this thing.

387
00:17:17,857 --> 00:17:20,073
You're blowing my audition!

388
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:23,007
I ache with embarrassment.

389
00:17:25,383 --> 00:17:29,043
The Japanese were never to be heard from again.

390
00:17:29,102 --> 00:17:31,199
Okay, what's going on here?

391
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:33,891
Okay, that's no surprise.

392
00:17:34,518 --> 00:17:35,697
George Michael?

393
00:17:35,787 --> 00:17:38,154
Dad, I'm sorry, I can't fly it very well.

394
00:17:38,242 --> 00:17:39,962
I think I really would rather have the Welch.

395
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:43,790
I didn't buy you that. I bought you the train set, which you guys just destroyed.

396
00:17:43,911 --> 00:17:45,266
Did you keep the receipt?

397
00:17:46,473 --> 00:17:47,545
What is that?

398
00:17:47,729 --> 00:17:50,208
Feedback. Is someone else wired?

399
00:17:50,292 --> 00:17:53,156
Oh, that's me. My friend Frank wired me.

400
00:17:53,278 --> 00:17:54,908
He wanted me to be a mole.

401
00:17:55,026 --> 00:17:57,359
- Our cover's blown!
- Let's get out of here.

402
00:17:59,415 --> 00:18:01,170
Good-bye, Tobias.

403
00:18:01,834 --> 00:18:03,924
He wanted you to be a mole?

404
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:08,891
Oh, my God. Tobias Funke. You're Mr. F.

405
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:11,575
Which means that man was Rita's uncle-- what have I done?

406
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,138
I have to get this suit back.

407
00:18:13,228 --> 00:18:16,906
They destroyed our town, but they can't take away our memories?

408
00:18:17,015 --> 00:18:19,495
Oh, I've had... The time of my life.

409
00:18:19,588 --> 00:18:21,842
I think he's being sarcastic, Gob.

410
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,676
No, I'm not, Mother.

411
00:18:24,801 --> 00:18:25,918
I mean lover.

412
00:18:26,018 --> 00:18:27,206
I like making love to Mother.

413
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:28,142
I mean lover!

414
00:18:28,239 --> 00:18:30,286
Oh, my God, Buster, is that you?

415
00:18:30,464 --> 00:18:31,909
Yes.

416
00:18:32,068 --> 00:18:34,764
Gob, it's just I wanted to spend some time with you.

417
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:36,056
That's all.

418
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:38,539
And you enjoyed it, you can't deny that.

419
00:18:39,049 --> 00:18:40,575
I guess you're right.

420
00:18:40,861 --> 00:18:43,278
Maybe we should spend more time together.

421
00:18:43,371 --> 00:18:45,904
Oh. I'd really like that.

422
00:18:45,998 --> 00:18:47,227
It's weird.

423
00:18:47,328 --> 00:18:51,704
It took some idiot parrot man with a camera in his hat to bring us together.

424
00:18:52,596 --> 00:18:56,228
But even a pro like Larry has a breaking point.

425
00:18:58,273 --> 00:18:59,155
Rita.

426
00:18:59,535 --> 00:19:01,490
What do you want? I have to pack.

427
00:19:01,896 --> 00:19:03,420
Pack? Where are you going?

428
00:19:03,487 --> 00:19:05,220
Someone called the bobbies on us.

429
00:19:05,289 --> 00:19:05,762
Oh, no.

430
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:07,945
My uncle and I have to go back to big Britain.

431
00:19:08,029 --> 00:19:10,413
Oh, that was me, Rita. I'm so, so sorry.

432
00:19:10,496 --> 00:19:12,162
I didn't know what was going on.

433
00:19:12,226 --> 00:19:14,494
Why did your uncle threaten me?

434
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:16,411
He thought you might be trouble.

435
00:19:16,493 --> 00:19:18,147
That was actually very astute of him.

436
00:19:19,002 --> 00:19:20,187
Good-bye, Michael.

437
00:19:21,206 --> 00:19:23,430
You know, I really did fancy you.

438
00:19:23,921 --> 00:19:26,188
- I can't stay here now.
- Marry me!

439
00:19:27,348 --> 00:19:29,692
- What?
- Let me marry you.

440
00:19:29,857 --> 00:19:32,755
You can get a green card, stay here, and we can see if this works.

441
00:19:32,841 --> 00:19:35,384
I know it sounds crazy, but...

442
00:19:35,493 --> 00:19:39,817
This will give us a chance to get away from both of our families and see if this works.

443
00:19:40,294 --> 00:19:41,664
Might be fun.

444
00:19:42,405 --> 00:19:43,415
Yes.

445
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:44,883
Really?

446
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,537
Yes.

447
00:19:47,662 --> 00:19:48,449
Yes.

448
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,161
Yes, yes!

449
00:19:50,318 --> 00:19:51,821
But let's go right now.

450
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,361
Before my uncle gets out of the shower for some more cigarettes.

451
00:19:54,452 --> 00:19:56,517
You take that. I got to leave a note.

452
00:20:04,211 --> 00:20:08,018
But there was one piece of intelligence that Michael didn't have.

453
00:20:08,126 --> 00:20:09,156
Interesting.

454
00:20:09,243 --> 00:20:10,494
Don't even think about it, Jay.

455
00:20:10,589 --> 00:20:11,971
She's an MRF.

456
00:20:12,056 --> 00:20:13,374
MRF? What's that?

457
00:20:13,466 --> 00:20:15,812
Mentally Retarded Female.

458
00:20:16,419 --> 00:20:18,327
That explains what she's doing with him.

459
00:20:18,404 --> 00:20:19,875
And the hats.

460
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,656
Oh, my God.

461
00:20:25,772 --> 00:20:27,423
She's gonna marry him.

462
00:20:27,705 --> 00:20:30,456
On the next... Arrested Development...

463
00:20:30,888 --> 00:20:36,941
George Sr., disoriented in the walls, almost makes contact with a new mole.

464
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:40,654
Not that one.

465
00:20:41,203 --> 00:20:42,458
Wait for it.

466
00:20:42,568 --> 00:20:43,764
Annyong?

467
00:20:44,404 --> 00:20:45,537
Hello?

468
00:20:45,712 --> 00:20:48,579
And Michael and Rita start a new life together.

469
00:20:48,673 --> 00:20:50,135
What's that?

470
00:20:50,241 --> 00:20:51,752
A prize.

471
00:20:51,869 --> 00:20:54,864
A lovely, lovely prize.

472
00:20:57,045 --> 00:20:59,206
