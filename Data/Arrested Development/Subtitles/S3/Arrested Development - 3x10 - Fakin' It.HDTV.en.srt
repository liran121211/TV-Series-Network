1
00:00:00,363 --> 00:00:03,291
Now the story of a wealthy family who lost everything

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:07,244
and the one son who had no choice but to keep them all together.

3
00:00:12,916 --> 00:00:14,996
It's... Arrested Development.

4
00:00:17,807 --> 00:00:21,954
Michael had received a witness list for his father's upcoming trial.

5
00:00:22,057 --> 00:00:23,249
Who's on the list, any blabbers?

6
00:00:23,338 --> 00:00:25,332
Well, they've got one guy who won't be talking.

7
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:28,091
That is unless there's a hand inside of him.

8
00:00:28,178 --> 00:00:30,630
Oh, please, Michael, even then, I wouldn't say anything.

9
00:00:30,724 --> 00:00:33,378
That's reassuring, but I was referring to Gob's puppet, Franklin.

10
00:00:33,476 --> 00:00:35,719
Yes! I got him in the system.

11
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:36,746
You did this on purpose.

12
00:00:36,832 --> 00:00:37,750
Oh, yeah.

13
00:00:37,856 --> 00:00:40,626
He is re-dyed, rested and ready to work.

14
00:00:40,723 --> 00:00:41,982
Thought it'd be a good way to get some press.

15
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:43,366
Oh, I got to tell Franklin.

16
00:00:43,464 --> 00:00:45,030
I think he meant "get Franklin."

17
00:00:45,124 --> 00:00:45,987
Am I on the list?

18
00:00:46,091 --> 00:00:46,980
We all are.

19
00:00:47,023 --> 00:00:48,169
Franklin, guess what?

20
00:00:48,193 --> 00:00:49,090
But I don't know anything.

21
00:00:49,122 --> 00:00:51,290
- He certainly hasn't heard anything from me.
- Mother doesn't know anything either.

22
00:00:51,336 --> 00:00:52,232
I don't know anything.

23
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:54,012
Well, you both certainly act innocent.

24
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:59,123
Buster knew a great deal for Lucille, almost nightly, got drunk and told him.

25
00:00:59,167 --> 00:01:02,952
Your father says he wants me to go all the way to Falluja.

26
00:01:03,184 --> 00:01:07,197
I thought he meant the sex act that's so popular with your generation.

27
00:01:07,316 --> 00:01:09,727
I know you're awake. Faker!

28
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:13,782
More significantly, they've put an N. Bluth on the witness list.

29
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:16,296
I hope that doesn't stand for what I think it stands for.

30
00:01:16,385 --> 00:01:18,014
Whoa, I did not say that.

31
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,993
You did, Gob. Your mouth moved, your hand didn't.

32
00:01:20,112 --> 00:01:22,206
Oh. Well, I should work on that.

33
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:25,252
Is there an N. Bluth in the family that we don't know about?

34
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:28,550
They say there's been money found in an account under that name.

35
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,253
Of course not. The prosecution is trying to test us,

36
00:01:31,362 --> 00:01:33,447
see if we're going to turn against each other.

37
00:01:33,559 --> 00:01:35,030
They make stuff up.

38
00:01:35,235 --> 00:01:36,760
She doesn't exist.

39
00:01:37,158 --> 00:01:39,538
Yet you refer to her as a she.

40
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,421
He, she-- what's the difference?

41
00:01:41,529 --> 00:01:44,727
Oh, here, here. In the dark, it all looks the same.

42
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,768
They're probably just taking a shot in the darkness.

43
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:51,403
But the good news is that Jan Eagleman called,

44
00:01:51,503 --> 00:01:54,519
and she is willing to consider our case.

45
00:01:54,637 --> 00:01:55,407
Jan Eagleman?

46
00:01:55,529 --> 00:01:57,511
She's from the Justice TV.

47
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,732
Not another media whore?

48
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:03,022
You know, frankly, I think I could put together a pretty good defense.

49
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:04,899
Oh, no, he thinks he's a lawyer again.

50
00:02:05,014 --> 00:02:09,372
Devotees will remember that Michael once played a lawyer in a school play.

51
00:02:09,404 --> 00:02:13,554
You're a crook, Captain Hook Judge, won't you throw the book at the pirate...

52
00:02:13,662 --> 00:02:16,546
Michael, just because you played a role doesn't make it real.

53
00:02:16,651 --> 00:02:19,773
Of course, Buster did grow up to be Captain Hook.

54
00:02:19,865 --> 00:02:21,159
Not cool, Mom.

55
00:02:21,579 --> 00:02:23,328
Oh, please, you'd be a lousy attorney.

56
00:02:23,413 --> 00:02:26,172
The first piece of evidence against us, you'd run for the hills.

57
00:02:26,264 --> 00:02:27,605
No, Jan is interested.

58
00:02:27,703 --> 00:02:31,437
She carries a lot of weight, and she is not charging us anything.

59
00:02:31,554 --> 00:02:33,564
Like to see a whore who that!

60
00:02:33,673 --> 00:02:35,983
Not the carrying the weight part, but...

61
00:02:36,086 --> 00:02:37,517
on the other hand, if it's free.

62
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:41,633
She wants us to do a mock trial, sort of a dry run, just get us ready.

63
00:02:41,742 --> 00:02:43,673
Well, I guess we could all use some experience in the courtroom.

64
00:02:43,774 --> 00:02:45,376
Fine, I'll go check her out, but I'll tell you all right now

65
00:02:45,482 --> 00:02:48,374
no one is going to lie on that stand.

66
00:02:49,028 --> 00:02:51,438
And no one is going to betray the family.

67
00:02:52,588 --> 00:02:54,213
Buster was nervous.

68
00:02:54,321 --> 00:02:57,417
That's what all the rocking and humming was about.

69
00:02:57,708 --> 00:03:01,541
And Michael met with Justice TV's Jan Eagleman

70
00:03:01,632 --> 00:03:05,838
- who was currently doing a tech rehearsal.
- ...for my new show-- Judge Reinhold.

71
00:03:05,938 --> 00:03:07,527
It's a reality courtroom show.

72
00:03:07,614 --> 00:03:09,725
You know there's an actor by that name, right?

73
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:10,945
This is what they put me in.

74
00:03:11,053 --> 00:03:13,716
Why did I lose all the weight if they're going to put me in a pool cover?

75
00:03:13,816 --> 00:03:15,417
I'm sorry. Are you an actual judge?

76
00:03:15,537 --> 00:03:17,984
No, that's just a coincidence.

77
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:22,121
I read somewhere Judge Judy made $25 million last year,

78
00:03:22,217 --> 00:03:25,578
and I'm, like, "Hey, I never even heard of the guy."

79
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,298
So you're doing this because your name is "Judge"?

80
00:03:28,397 --> 00:03:31,097
Honestly, this is the first time I put those two things together.

81
00:03:31,206 --> 00:03:33,029
Maybe we should take "Judge" out of the title

82
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:36,478
and go with my original title Mr. Reinhold's Courtroom.

83
00:03:36,592 --> 00:03:38,572
No, no, no. We're changing the name.

84
00:03:39,484 --> 00:03:40,491
Thanks, Michael.

85
00:03:40,798 --> 00:03:45,000
Got 250,000 talking magazine ads and he wants to change the name.

86
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,998
My name is Judge.

87
00:03:47,108 --> 00:03:49,365
I hear you want to do a mock trial. Yeah?

88
00:03:49,449 --> 00:03:50,900
And we can do it here on the set.

89
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,583
'Cause I'm looking for Judge Reinhold to have a little practice too.

90
00:03:53,836 --> 00:03:55,803
I'll be acting as the prosecutor.

91
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,660
That way I can see how your family holds up.

92
00:03:57,764 --> 00:04:00,847
Families that do well are the ones that stick together.

93
00:04:02,062 --> 00:04:04,132
Well, that-that's us.

94
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,836
Um... we are going to need a defense attorney, right,

95
00:04:06,937 --> 00:04:09,048
for the mock trial and that's not going to be cheap.

96
00:04:09,156 --> 00:04:11,510
You know the case. Why not you?

97
00:04:11,761 --> 00:04:14,741
You're a crook Captain Hook...

98
00:04:14,834 --> 00:04:17,130
Yeah, give me a chance to show my dad what I can do.

99
00:04:17,228 --> 00:04:20,207
I'll-I'll show him. I'll make a fool out of him.

100
00:04:21,097 --> 00:04:23,598
While sticking together. One minute.

101
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,822
And that's when Michael found out his brother Buster was in a coma.

102
00:04:27,937 --> 00:04:28,971
Hey, what happened? How is he?

103
00:04:29,087 --> 00:04:30,509
Waiting for the doctor.

104
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:34,670
I  just pray it's one of those things where he's unconscious throughout the entire trial.

105
00:04:34,778 --> 00:04:38,529
And when it's over, he wakes up and gets a big toy.

106
00:04:38,638 --> 00:04:40,843
Wait  a minute. Are you responsible for this, Mom?

107
00:04:40,944 --> 00:04:44,315
Did you put one of your sons into a coma so that he can't testify?

108
00:04:44,432 --> 00:04:46,415
Michael, how dare you?

109
00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:49,613
Of course it crossed my mind. But this was all Buster.

110
00:04:49,728 --> 00:04:51,612
He got into your brother's pills.

111
00:04:51,715 --> 00:04:53,488
Not the Forget Me Nows.

112
00:04:53,595 --> 00:04:56,485
He asked me for them. I didn't know. I thought he was dating again.

113
00:04:56,575 --> 00:04:59,969
Hope you don't mind me saying, but these things can go on indefinitely.

114
00:05:00,072 --> 00:05:02,002
My mother's been in that bed for two years.

115
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:05,709
Oh, how awful. We don't have a private room.

116
00:05:05,807 --> 00:05:07,800
They won't let me take out her feeding tube.

117
00:05:07,927 --> 00:05:11,018
And I'm lucky. I have the resources to pay for these medical bills.

118
00:05:11,117 --> 00:05:12,513
You have resources?

119
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,804
What good is my money if I can't bring her back?

120
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:18,120
But you can't, and money should be spent on dating.

121
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,161
Is that what you were going to say?

122
00:05:19,258 --> 00:05:20,213
Let's go ahead and wait outside.

123
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,899
So, you come here often?

124
00:05:23,594 --> 00:05:24,746
Cute button.

125
00:05:25,157 --> 00:05:25,855
How is he?

126
00:05:25,942 --> 00:05:27,219
We're still waiting to find out.

127
00:05:27,531 --> 00:05:29,391
I got here as soon as I could.

128
00:05:29,494 --> 00:05:30,979
Oh, the red tape.

129
00:05:31,222 --> 00:05:33,021
Looks a little bit more like Red Prawn, Dad.

130
00:05:33,123 --> 00:05:35,873
It's the shrimpfest. Oh, the shrimp.

131
00:05:35,979 --> 00:05:39,426
You realize that Buster is probably in this state because of you and Mom.

132
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:42,440
He's obviously afraid of what he knows and he's just trying to forget.

133
00:05:42,546 --> 00:05:44,490
Does he know who N. Bluth is?

134
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:46,430
Right now he doesn't know who B. Bluth is.

135
00:05:46,545 --> 00:05:48,394
I'm going to need some real answers out of you pretty soon

136
00:05:48,437 --> 00:05:49,912
because I've just discussed it with Jan.

137
00:05:49,988 --> 00:05:52,391
I am going to be pretending to be your attorney

138
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,930
at the mock trial before Judge Reinhold.

139
00:05:55,032 --> 00:05:59,284
You're the lawyer. Oh, that's the same representation Captain Hook had.

140
00:06:00,157 --> 00:06:02,313
Oh, it's so good to laugh again.

141
00:06:02,415 --> 00:06:03,828
- Oh, feels good. 
- It does.

142
00:06:03,954 --> 00:06:05,652
They say seven minutes heals all wounds.

143
00:06:05,762 --> 00:06:09,466
Wait, not the Judge Reinhold show from all those magazine ads.

144
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,356
They're all over the place. Look at this.

145
00:06:13,242 --> 00:06:14,840
My name is Judge.

146
00:06:14,956 --> 00:06:16,906
I didn't even know that this kind of technology even existed.

147
00:06:16,998 --> 00:06:19,363
I could use this in my ventriloquism act.

148
00:06:19,487 --> 00:06:21,004
They have a bar here?

149
00:06:21,586 --> 00:06:25,702
Well, Buster's in what we call a light to no coma.

150
00:06:25,797 --> 00:06:29,330
In layman's term, it might be considered a very heavy nap.

151
00:06:29,427 --> 00:06:30,860
Could that mean that he's faking it.

152
00:06:30,984 --> 00:06:32,339
Oh, highly likely this is fake.

153
00:06:32,451 --> 00:06:34,688
Although there doesn't seem to be very much brain activity.

154
00:06:34,799 --> 00:06:35,964
Nope, that's him.

155
00:06:36,087 --> 00:06:38,563
I think it's very important that we remember he's fully insured.

156
00:06:38,654 --> 00:06:40,672
I say we see how this plays out.

157
00:06:40,786 --> 00:06:42,753
Absolutely. And we're going to be here every day.

158
00:06:42,849 --> 00:06:46,519
I don't care if it takes from now till the end of shrimpfest.

159
00:06:47,744 --> 00:06:49,569
Well, if this young man gets bored,

160
00:06:49,687 --> 00:06:51,487
we need a lot of volunteers here at the hospital.

161
00:06:51,608 --> 00:06:53,769
Turning over the bedridden, changing bedpans.

162
00:06:53,876 --> 00:06:55,397
Heard there's a mall across the street.

163
00:06:55,511 --> 00:06:56,604
Oh, you want excitement.

164
00:06:56,715 --> 00:06:58,038
Well, we have a group of young people

165
00:06:58,138 --> 00:07:01,089
who put on fake weddings for our Alzheimer's patients.

166
00:07:01,207 --> 00:07:04,804
Actually, it would probably look pretty good on some college application.

167
00:07:04,907 --> 00:07:06,474
Would I have to touch the old people?

168
00:07:06,581 --> 00:07:08,689
Only their hearts. You could be a groom.

169
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,298
Bring a little girlfriend up there with you.

170
00:07:10,405 --> 00:07:11,432
Oh, I don't have a girlfriend.

171
00:07:11,554 --> 00:07:13,178
A sister than, or a cousin.

172
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:15,496
Of course, you're going to have to kiss.

173
00:07:15,782 --> 00:07:17,813
Guess who liked that idea?

174
00:07:17,924 --> 00:07:20,378
He says he doesn't want to do it. I'm actually to respec this choices...

175
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:24,419
Good. I... great. I was just... Well, don't answer for...

176
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:28,125
I, um, yeah. 'Cause I exactly the cousin, I mean, the...

177
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,517
the girl I would want to give and she'll want give too.

178
00:07:30,631 --> 00:07:32,233
We'll... and we'll do that together.

179
00:07:32,343 --> 00:07:34,305
For them, for the sake of...

180
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,555
I  ju... it's a great day.

181
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,713
For being sad.

182
00:07:41,112 --> 00:07:44,236
And later, Michael was preparing for his case.

183
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:47,632
So I've got a date with the guy with the brain-dead mom.

184
00:07:47,735 --> 00:07:51,273
I mean, it's just a... for them to pull the plug on our loved ones.

185
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:53,842
Giving up hope on Buster pretty quickly there, Lindsay.

186
00:07:53,947 --> 00:07:56,709
Listen, I know Buster. I know what he wants.

187
00:07:56,821 --> 00:07:58,207
Oh, I love soup.

188
00:07:58,336 --> 00:08:01,913
If the only thing I could do was lay in bed all day and eat soup, I'd be happy.

189
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:04,576
I wouldn't even have to taste it. I could just take it through a tube.

190
00:08:04,676 --> 00:08:07,331
That would actually be better 'cause I wouldn't even burn my mouth.

191
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:10,895
Never let me die.

192
00:08:11,287 --> 00:08:13,326
Yeah, he wants out.

193
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:16,194
Anyway, you and I both know he's probably just faking.

194
00:08:16,466 --> 00:08:17,514
Busy?

195
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:19,965
- Actually...
- Check this out. My lips don't move.

196
00:08:20,078 --> 00:08:22,601
They call me up to the stand, say something like, "Who's this little friend?"

197
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:24,525
- And he's say...
- My name is Judge.

198
00:08:24,615 --> 00:08:26,688
- Who's name is Judge?
- My name is...

199
00:08:26,792 --> 00:08:27,319
Okay.

200
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:28,927
- That's a silly name.
- That's enough.

201
00:08:29,023 --> 00:08:30,855
Judge. My name...

202
00:08:30,964 --> 00:08:33,363
Yes, I am judging your name. It am silly.

203
00:08:33,781 --> 00:08:35,739
- Please stop.
- Oh, now you're correcting my grammar?

204
00:08:35,832 --> 00:08:39,150
Gob, not going to put Franklin on the stand, and your lips are moving just a little bit.

205
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:40,306
Judge.

206
00:08:40,423 --> 00:08:41,770
He's right, his name is Judge now.

207
00:08:41,885 --> 00:08:44,111
You know, I think Dad might actually have a case here.

208
00:08:44,194 --> 00:08:46,458
I mean, I am concerned about this N. Bluth,

209
00:08:46,618 --> 00:08:48,788
but if it is indeed just a ploy on their part,

210
00:08:48,894 --> 00:08:54,278
then the only bombshell that they've got is the blueprint of an Iraqi model home

211
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:58,626
the same blueprint as ours, with no record that we actually got paid for it.

212
00:08:58,729 --> 00:09:00,405
Although this is strange.

213
00:09:00,514 --> 00:09:03,453
It looks like there's a secret room in this one off the hallway.

214
00:09:03,572 --> 00:09:06,055
I wonder if we've got that. I'm gonna check that out.

215
00:09:06,184 --> 00:09:07,814
Okay, and we're going to go back to the hospital.

216
00:09:07,921 --> 00:09:12,238
Yeah, good, check on Buster. We do need to stick together as a family on this.

217
00:09:12,367 --> 00:09:14,226
Actually going to to swipeso me more talking magazines,

218
00:09:14,328 --> 00:09:16,155
but I'll make sureto poke the head in.

219
00:09:16,278 --> 00:09:17,358
My...

220
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:24,796
And  Michael found that there was indeed a secret room

221
00:09:24,907 --> 00:09:28,089
where his father had stored the family mementos,

222
00:09:28,191 --> 00:09:30,576
including his birth certificate.

223
00:09:30,686 --> 00:09:32,225
"Nichael Bluth"?

224
00:09:34,148 --> 00:09:36,445
Am I N. Bluth?

225
00:09:36,553 --> 00:09:41,113
Is he trying to set me up? If I'm N. Bluth, I'm going to prison.

226
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:43,400
Nichael was worried.

227
00:09:46,714 --> 00:09:49,902
Michael had just discovered a hidden room in the model home

228
00:09:49,983 --> 00:09:52,449
where all the family secrets were stored.

229
00:09:52,556 --> 00:09:58,201
My dad's trying to pinall of his crimes on "N. Bluth," and I might be N. Bluth.

230
00:09:58,312 --> 00:10:00,454
At least that's what it says according to my birth certificate.

231
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:02,612
All of our family records are up here.

232
00:10:02,721 --> 00:10:05,984
And, for some reason, this stack of body building magazines.

233
00:10:06,829 --> 00:10:09,831
Well, I guess your, uh... your dad must have had these from way back when, huh?

234
00:10:09,941 --> 00:10:11,111
My  name is Ju...

235
00:10:11,233 --> 00:10:12,795
That seems kind of current.

236
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:14,425
Uh. Who am I trying to kid, Michael.

237
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:16,869
I was trying to beef up to impress that wife of mine,

238
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:20,048
but now she's after some rich guy who's trying to kill his mom, and...

239
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:21,673
I have to go talk to my dad.

240
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:22,720
You coming out?

241
00:10:22,825 --> 00:10:24,977
No. No, I've got to fight for my wife.

242
00:10:25,084 --> 00:10:27,102
I'm going to keep my marriage alive.

243
00:10:29,308 --> 00:10:32,238
One room over, George Michael was also trying

244
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,964
to convince someone to pursue a fake marriage.

245
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,556
We'd have to kiss.

246
00:10:36,723 --> 00:10:38,938
Wouldn't that bekind of weird after what we've been through?

247
00:10:39,044 --> 00:10:40,093
Well, that was a long time ago.

248
00:10:40,217 --> 00:10:43,216
It had been two months since they'd kiss.

249
00:10:43,337 --> 00:10:46,029
Well, it does sound like a good twist on a wedding film.

250
00:10:46,123 --> 00:10:46,564
A film?

251
00:10:46,653 --> 00:10:48,768
Without the corny runaway bride bit in the middle.

252
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:49,622
Oh, well, yeah.

253
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:53,981
And, so, like many people who no longer felt anything for each other,

254
00:10:54,076 --> 00:10:56,139
they decided to get married.

255
00:10:56,247 --> 00:10:59,457
I'm "N. Bluth," aren't I? Legally, that's my real name.

256
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:02,562
You've been doing all the Iraq business under it thinking that it wouldn't be traceable.

257
00:11:02,654 --> 00:11:04,782
But it is, and I'm going down.

258
00:11:04,876 --> 00:11:07,213
For God's sake, it's a typo, Michael.

259
00:11:07,302 --> 00:11:08,902
What kind of father do you think I am?

260
00:11:09,003 --> 00:11:10,546
They even got your birth date wrong.

261
00:11:10,662 --> 00:11:11,941
That is my birth date.

262
00:11:12,045 --> 00:11:13,342
Close to Christmas.

263
00:11:13,471 --> 00:11:14,745
Was that hard?

264
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,033
It's a coincidence, Michael!

265
00:11:17,147 --> 00:11:19,294
You're not N. Bluth. There is no N. Bluth.

266
00:11:19,406 --> 00:11:23,053
I called Jan Eagleman about this, and she says it sounds pretty bad.

267
00:11:23,164 --> 00:11:24,896
You called her? She's with the prosecution.

268
00:11:25,036 --> 00:11:25,901
Just for the mock trial.

269
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:28,086
Yeah, but what if she wasn't, Mi...

270
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,728
You know, I am glad we're having this mock trial,

271
00:11:30,818 --> 00:11:35,337
because it has shown me that you cannot be involved in the real defense.

272
00:11:35,431 --> 00:11:37,228
- Oh, come on.
- Why can't you be like Buster?

273
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:39,913
He put himself in a coma to protect this family.

274
00:11:40,012 --> 00:11:41,065
Poor kid.

275
00:11:42,508 --> 00:11:43,896
I have to get down there now.

276
00:11:44,005 --> 00:11:45,170
Shrimpfest is over, Pop.

277
00:11:45,282 --> 00:11:46,164
Really?

278
00:11:46,532 --> 00:11:47,774
Better go to Chili's.

279
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:52,922
Back at the hospital, Lindsay had joined Brian in protest.

280
00:11:53,016 --> 00:11:55,612
All they're doing in there is trying to keep people alive.

281
00:11:55,736 --> 00:11:56,924
It's a life mill!

282
00:11:57,036 --> 00:11:58,408
Oh, hello, Lindsay.

283
00:11:58,522 --> 00:12:01,244
I'd like to introduce you to a friend of mine that I met at the gym.

284
00:12:01,347 --> 00:12:02,608
Hi. I'm Father Ben.

285
00:12:02,732 --> 00:12:06,810
Ben is a Franciscan who can bench pressover 200 pounds,

286
00:12:06,918 --> 00:12:09,199
and he talked me into protesting, too.

287
00:12:09,303 --> 00:12:10,595
Show them your sign.

288
00:12:12,818 --> 00:12:14,055
No, the other side.

289
00:12:14,173 --> 00:12:18,147
Tobias, Brian and I believe in the dignity of every human being.

290
00:12:18,257 --> 00:12:21,566
Now why don't we leave the fruits with the vegetables and go get a coffee.

291
00:12:22,155 --> 00:12:23,200
Do some push-ups.

292
00:12:23,313 --> 00:12:26,539
George Michael and Maeby were also at the hospital,

293
00:12:26,644 --> 00:12:29,758
putting on a wedding for the Alzheimer's patients.

294
00:12:29,876 --> 00:12:31,883
...and now they are truly family.

295
00:12:31,994 --> 00:12:33,530
It is permanent.

296
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,602
Eternal.

297
00:12:34,706 --> 00:12:38,284
And Maeby did the thing she had always thought was so corny...

298
00:12:38,388 --> 00:12:39,595
I can't do this.

299
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:41,018
- I can't do this. 
- But, we aren't...

300
00:12:41,115 --> 00:12:42,199
- What am I doing?! 
- We're not...

301
00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:43,582
...and ran away.

302
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,198
What are we going to do?

303
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:48,903
Just give it a minute.

304
00:12:52,761 --> 00:12:54,318
Now it's a Bar Mitzvah.

305
00:12:54,472 --> 00:12:58,145
And as George Michael acted like a boy becoming a man,

306
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:02,350
Michael returned to his office to find a man acting like a boy.

307
00:13:02,439 --> 00:13:03,113
What's this?

308
00:13:03,217 --> 00:13:04,863
Just practicing my testimony.

309
00:13:04,961 --> 00:13:06,014
Needed a fake witness box.

310
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,269
And you couldn't have just taken my stuff off the desk first,

311
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:09,386
or unplugged my computer?

312
00:13:09,496 --> 00:13:10,950
Justice is swift, Michael.

313
00:13:11,035 --> 00:13:13,019
Plus, we needed to be prepared for our testimony.

314
00:13:13,117 --> 00:13:16,721
You're not doing any of that "My name is Judge" stuff on the stand, okay?

315
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:19,238
No! They're all out of magazines at the hospital.

316
00:13:19,344 --> 00:13:20,569
Besides, I've got a better idea.

317
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:22,019
Which he got at the hospital.

318
00:13:22,113 --> 00:13:27,202
Patient presented with gastric bacterial infection, coupled with peptic ulcers.

319
00:13:27,304 --> 00:13:30,161
Tetracycline should not be administered due to allergies...

320
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:32,425
Check this out! You'll say, "Who's this little friend?"

321
00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:34,847
And I'll say, "Well, he's not really feeling that well."

322
00:13:34,936 --> 00:13:37,128
And you'll say, "Oh, what's wrong the this little guy."

323
00:13:37,227 --> 00:13:38,491
And he'll say...

324
00:13:38,587 --> 00:13:41,886
Patient presented with gastric bacterial infection.

325
00:13:41,995 --> 00:13:46,437
Wow... Sounds like you could use some "tricyclene."

326
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:49,018
Tetracycline should not be administered due to allergies.

327
00:13:49,107 --> 00:13:52,989
Your lips are still moving, and... you stole the doctor's tape recorder?

328
00:13:53,144 --> 00:13:53,922
Just the tape.

329
00:13:54,029 --> 00:13:54,911
I'm giving it back to him.

330
00:13:55,028 --> 00:13:56,121
- Come on, Michael! 
- Gob...

331
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,506
I need this! My career needs this.

332
00:13:58,602 --> 00:13:59,879
Dad was right.

333
00:14:00,029 --> 00:14:02,674
If you really cared about this family, you'd be more supportive of me in this.

334
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:06,063
Gob, I'm not going to turn this mock trial into some kind of...

335
00:14:06,778 --> 00:14:08,002
You were going to say "mockery," weren't you?

336
00:14:08,093 --> 00:14:09,899
I was in trouble, like, three words into that.

337
00:14:10,006 --> 00:14:12,237
So, Michael went back to the hospital

338
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:15,693
when he had a visit from the real prosecutor.

339
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:17,719
Wayne, what you doing here?

340
00:14:17,811 --> 00:14:19,943
We heard about the trial. We want to make a deal with you.

341
00:14:20,034 --> 00:14:22,145
A deal? It's a mock trial.

342
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:23,192
Read the Patriot Act:

343
00:14:23,292 --> 00:14:25,954
"Anything said in a mock trial or daytime courtroom show

344
00:14:26,059 --> 00:14:29,865
can be used in any real criminal proceeding, or prime-time procedural show,

345
00:14:29,973 --> 00:14:33,438
subject to the interpretation of the presiding judge, or the executive producer."

346
00:14:33,537 --> 00:14:35,512
In our case, Judge Reinhold is both.

347
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,997
- Did he get E.P.?
- Sure did.

348
00:14:37,105 --> 00:14:38,108
Good for him.

349
00:14:38,215 --> 00:14:40,321
Anyway, you put your dad on the stand, get him talking,

350
00:14:40,418 --> 00:14:41,624
and you get full immunity.

351
00:14:41,716 --> 00:14:45,009
If you don't do it, we're going to go after N. Bluth, and we think that's you.

352
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,052
You're asking me to conspire against my own client.

353
00:14:47,141 --> 00:14:48,472
Couldn't you go to jail for that?

354
00:14:48,569 --> 00:14:49,920
Think about it, Michael,

355
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:51,794
it may be time to cut and run.

356
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:53,594
Well, we don't do that in my family.

357
00:14:58,437 --> 00:15:03,476
Maeby had just run away from a fake wedding that had gotten a little too real.

358
00:15:03,588 --> 00:15:05,257
Oh! You know about this room, too?

359
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:07,459
Yeah, it's my dad's exercise room.

360
00:15:07,597 --> 00:15:11,782
Although for all her worldliness, Maeby was still a child in many ways.

361
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:14,528
Um, yeah, I-I come here to think myself sometimes, you know.

362
00:15:14,621 --> 00:15:16,732
I mean, I always knock first. I-I always do that.

363
00:15:16,856 --> 00:15:18,746
I always do that anyway, no matter what room.

364
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,821
So, um, what happened back there?

365
00:15:20,922 --> 00:15:23,909
I don't know, I guess I just got a little weirded out.

366
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:26,239
I  mean, we're cousins. It's wrong.

367
00:15:26,321 --> 00:15:28,435
Well, you know the Torah tells us that the larger wrong

368
00:15:28,531 --> 00:15:31,383
is to put our own feelings before the commitments we've made.

369
00:15:31,487 --> 00:15:33,471
You know, towards the sick, aged and gross.

370
00:15:33,595 --> 00:15:34,814
That's not in the Torah.

371
00:15:34,918 --> 00:15:37,743
And I mean, you know, we weren't there for ourselves today.

372
00:15:37,848 --> 00:15:40,259
We were there to bring happiness to others.

373
00:15:40,444 --> 00:15:46,620
And... I just... I just feel now like we left a lot of old people sad there today.

374
00:15:46,716 --> 00:15:48,587
Again, not true.

375
00:15:53,602 --> 00:15:57,249
I mean, you know, I'm not saying it's not weird for me, too.

376
00:15:57,499 --> 00:15:59,659
I'm just saying maybe we could take those weird feelings

377
00:15:59,756 --> 00:16:01,384
and turn them into something positive.

378
00:16:01,489 --> 00:16:03,456
He really wanted that kiss.

379
00:16:03,557 --> 00:16:06,178
I mean, I guess it would be a good way to freak out our parents.

380
00:16:06,282 --> 00:16:07,621
Let's freak them out!

381
00:16:08,471 --> 00:16:10,697
Ooh. Hey, you guys know about this room, too, huh?

382
00:16:10,784 --> 00:16:13,444
I'm just looking for some evidence for my trial against Pop-Pop.

383
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:14,865
For Pop-Pop.

384
00:16:17,695 --> 00:16:20,389
I mean, seriously, Doctor, when are we going to know something?

385
00:16:20,488 --> 00:16:21,872
I'm trying to get on with my life.

386
00:16:21,968 --> 00:16:23,551
Yeah, so is what remains of Buster.

387
00:16:23,656 --> 00:16:25,420
Dr. Farmer, there's a problem in 302.

388
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:28,094
The patient's having a bad reaction to the tetracycline.

389
00:16:28,193 --> 00:16:29,381
Tetracycline?

390
00:16:29,469 --> 00:16:31,111
Didn't I say not to give him that?

391
00:16:31,203 --> 00:16:33,214
Didn't you listen to my notes?

392
00:16:33,324 --> 00:16:36,024
It ain't easy being white

393
00:16:36,123 --> 00:16:37,504
It ain't easy...

394
00:16:37,618 --> 00:16:40,892
I'm trying to get on with my life. And you know what? You can't deal with it.

395
00:16:40,922 --> 00:16:42,056
No, I can't Lindsay.

396
00:16:42,154 --> 00:16:43,085
You're not interested in me.

397
00:16:43,176 --> 00:16:44,584
And you're not capable of intimacy.

398
00:16:44,675 --> 00:16:46,286
Well, just fake it!

399
00:16:47,627 --> 00:16:48,667
Coma.

400
00:16:49,596 --> 00:16:53,077
And, believe it or not, that actually got through to them.

401
00:16:53,794 --> 00:16:58,212
Now will you please turn on the Cartoon Network and get the hell out of here?

402
00:16:58,343 --> 00:17:01,118
And the next day, the mock trial began,

403
00:17:01,242 --> 00:17:04,937
as did the mock episode of what had now been renamed...

404
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,918
Mock Trial With J. Reinhold.

405
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,693
Take one. In five, four, three...

406
00:17:10,889 --> 00:17:13,269
Mock trial with J. Reinhold

407
00:17:13,498 --> 00:17:16,115
Mock trial with J. Reinhold

408
00:17:16,265 --> 00:17:18,573
Mock trial with J. Reinhold

409
00:17:18,742 --> 00:17:20,241
Mock trial!

410
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:25,642
All rise for acting's highest honor, Judge Reinhold.

411
00:17:25,765 --> 00:17:29,376
Judge Reinhold is neither a real judge, nor has he received acting's highest honor.

412
00:17:30,827 --> 00:17:32,581
Wow. Thank you.

413
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:37,054
That's the first time I ever got a standing ovation before the show.

414
00:17:38,526 --> 00:17:39,385
They're not clapping.

415
00:17:39,494 --> 00:17:41,032
They don't in a courtroom.

416
00:17:41,378 --> 00:17:43,356
Please be seated.

417
00:17:43,472 --> 00:17:45,181
The proceedings got underway,

418
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:49,318
and the Bluths set about pretending they were a family that sticks together.

419
00:17:49,414 --> 00:17:53,268
You never heard anyone in your family discuss plans to either travel to Iraq,

420
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:54,865
or... do business there?

421
00:17:54,946 --> 00:17:59,700
Well, I spend so much time making sweet love on my wife,

422
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:03,987
that it's hard to hear anything over the clatter of her breasts and...

423
00:18:04,086 --> 00:18:04,977
Your witness.

424
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,470
I have nothing.

425
00:18:08,386 --> 00:18:11,090
Oh, how should I know where the money comes from.

426
00:18:11,184 --> 00:18:16,494
I just know where it goes-- to taking care of my poor, comatose son.

427
00:18:16,593 --> 00:18:19,890
And if this were the real trial, I'd cry here.

428
00:18:20,008 --> 00:18:21,874
I'm saving my good stuff, too.

429
00:18:22,467 --> 00:18:23,731
I've no cross at this time.

430
00:18:23,829 --> 00:18:26,628
Now this is why you're not handling my real defense.

431
00:18:26,743 --> 00:18:28,710
I have one witness, Dad, and he'll clearevery thing up.

432
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,442
Gob had a little trouble.

433
00:18:30,537 --> 00:18:31,766
State your name.

434
00:18:32,877 --> 00:18:34,537
My name is Judge.

435
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:37,373
What kind of name is that, "Magazine"?

436
00:18:37,505 --> 00:18:40,807
I'm just going to go ahead and jump in right here. I have nothing for him.

437
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,499
But now it was Michael's turn.

438
00:18:43,621 --> 00:18:45,707
Well, listen, have fun out there, because this is the last time

439
00:18:45,795 --> 00:18:47,626
you're going to see this side of a courtroom

440
00:18:47,706 --> 00:18:50,278
till your second wife divorces your freckled ass.

441
00:18:50,368 --> 00:18:52,035
Look at that, you just blew your wedding speech.

442
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:55,310
I'd like to jump right ahead to calling a surprise witness.

443
00:18:55,404 --> 00:18:57,400
Only witnesses on the list.

444
00:18:57,489 --> 00:18:58,889
Oh, he's on the list.

445
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,409
I would like to call to the stand...

446
00:19:02,649 --> 00:19:05,621
Franklin Delano Bluth.

447
00:19:06,098 --> 00:19:07,623
You're calling Franklin, Mikey?

448
00:19:07,726 --> 00:19:08,856
I sure am, pal.

449
00:19:08,963 --> 00:19:10,474
I support my brother.

450
00:19:11,324 --> 00:19:13,889
It ain't easy being white

451
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,944
It ain't easy being brown

452
00:19:17,034 --> 00:19:19,166
You're my bro

453
00:19:19,747 --> 00:19:23,045
- Not my brother. 
- You Honor, this is highly unusual.

454
00:19:23,139 --> 00:19:26,220
Well, I'm very curious to see where this is going. I'm going to allow it.

455
00:19:26,311 --> 00:19:29,787
But I'm warning you, Mr. Bluth, this better make for a good promo.

456
00:19:29,898 --> 00:19:32,739
I was approached by the real prosecution recently,

457
00:19:32,847 --> 00:19:37,565
and was asked if I would be willing to turn on my family and save myself.

458
00:19:37,658 --> 00:19:42,673
Would you please press the "play" button on the tape recorder inside the puppet.

459
00:19:42,782 --> 00:19:46,053
If you don't do it, we're going to go after N. Bluth, and we think that's you.

460
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,281
You're asking me to conspire against my own client.

461
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,119
Couldn't you go to jail for that?

462
00:19:51,121 --> 00:19:52,111
Think about it, Michael.

463
00:19:52,196 --> 00:19:54,521
Well, it looks like we've got a mistrial.

464
00:19:54,631 --> 00:19:58,998
But on the plus side, we've also got a Hung Jury-- hit it!

465
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:01,708
Mock trial with J. Reinhold

466
00:20:01,816 --> 00:20:04,469
Mock trial with J. Reinhold

467
00:20:04,572 --> 00:20:06,983
Mock trial with J. Reinhold...

468
00:20:07,285 --> 00:20:09,134
You did good out there, Michael.

469
00:20:09,534 --> 00:20:12,653
But it's just a mock trial. Why don't you just take it to the grand jury?

470
00:20:12,737 --> 00:20:14,348
I wanted to prove to you that I could do it.

471
00:20:14,435 --> 00:20:17,223
I'm going to a grand jury with that now.

472
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:21,115
Actually, Michael had no idea that's what he was supposed to do.

473
00:20:21,222 --> 00:20:22,890
Nice job. You have a real shot.

474
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:25,085
You all stuck together, and that's what wins case.

475
00:20:25,187 --> 00:20:27,058
We don't abandon each other.

476
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:29,600
No one's closer than the Bluth family.

477
00:20:29,707 --> 00:20:30,395
They were.

478
00:20:30,492 --> 00:20:33,546
I know pronounce you husband and wife.

479
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:37,841
For as it turns out, the fake priest was called to a patient's room,

480
00:20:37,934 --> 00:20:41,863
and Father Ben filled in-- not knowing it was fake.

481
00:20:41,985 --> 00:20:44,557
And that's how the kids got married.

482
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:47,608
On the next... Arrested development

483
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:50,639
Mock Trial With J. Reinhold leads to imitators.

484
00:20:52,608 --> 00:20:54,163
Please be seated.

485
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:57,039
Hard to sit when you got someone's hand up your ass.

486
00:20:58,329 --> 00:21:00,793
All right, let's lose the puppet.

487
00:21:00,935 --> 00:21:05,341
And Michael discovers that he wasn't "N. Bluth" after all.

488
00:21:06,554 --> 00:21:08,811
I have an older sister?

489
00:21:08,963 --> 00:21:11,077
So much for not abandoning family.

490
00:21:11,167 --> 00:21:12,304
