00:00:00,819 --> 00:00:03,079
Previously on... Arrested Development

2
00:00:03,143 --> 00:00:06,301
Michael and his son were camping out at the family cabin

3
00:00:06,356 --> 00:00:08,273
before it was to be relocated.

4
00:00:08,345 --> 00:00:10,412
I'm just in the middle of a stupid girl problem, that's all.

5
00:00:10,463 --> 00:00:13,510
I don't even have a girl much less a stupid one.

6
00:00:13,571 --> 00:00:15,609
No, the problem is stupid, the girl isn't stupid.

7
00:00:15,676 --> 00:00:17,991
But if they ever had a child, it would be.

8
00:00:18,052 --> 00:00:20,278
Because the girl was his cousin Maeby.

9
00:00:20,335 --> 00:00:23,509
Tomorrow morning, before we tell the cops that that's not Pop-Pop in prison,

10
00:00:23,561 --> 00:00:25,559
we're going to go down to the lake, we're going to discuss

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,929
your girl problem man-to-man and it's going to be fun.

12
00:00:27,984 --> 00:00:29,939
Especially the part about the cops.

13
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:32,204
But Pop-Pop had other plans.

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,688
And Michael awoke to find his camping trip going south.

15
00:00:38,373 --> 00:00:40,991
Well, you better get up now if you want to see the lake.

16
00:00:42,174 --> 00:00:45,613
And that when George Sr. made a desperate plea.

17
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,931
Promise me you won't send me back to prison.

18
00:00:49,003 --> 00:00:51,312
So I can be with my dear love Lucille.

19
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:53,651
In the twilight of her face.

20
00:00:53,733 --> 00:00:56,662
Michael didn't send his father back to prison...

21
00:00:56,734 --> 00:01:00,298
But instead arranged for him to be placed under house arrest...

22
00:01:00,363 --> 00:01:03,902
George, we're never going to be out of each other's sight!

23
00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:06,801
...which made this woman his warden.

24
00:01:06,893 --> 00:01:08,722
Oh, dear God.

25
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:11,280
Send me back to prison. You got to send me back to prison.

26
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:12,494
More touching!

27
00:01:16,917 --> 00:01:21,997
Michael went to his parents' penthouse to discuss his father's ever worsening legal situation.

28
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:22,979
Where is everybody?

29
00:01:23,052 --> 00:01:24,249
How should I know, Michael?

30
00:01:24,316 --> 00:01:27,123
As soon as Father came back, I've been like the invisible man.

31
00:01:27,198 --> 00:01:29,969
Hello? Can anyone see me?

32
00:01:30,075 --> 00:01:31,284
Where's your hand, anyway?

33
00:01:31,346 --> 00:01:33,045
Why even bother getting dressed up?

34
00:01:33,106 --> 00:01:34,101
I have no one.

35
00:01:34,162 --> 00:01:36,425
What? Buster, come on now, you know, if you're really lonely,

36
00:01:36,466 --> 00:01:40,028
maybe it's time you went out there and you got yourself a girlf..

37
00:01:40,137 --> 00:01:40,962
a pet.

38
00:01:41,027 --> 00:01:42,165
How about a turtle?

39
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:42,784
Great.

40
00:01:42,855 --> 00:01:45,514
I've always loved those leathery little snappy faces.

41
00:01:46,762 --> 00:01:48,231
Certainly have a type.

42
00:01:49,522 --> 00:01:50,909
Mother, have you seen my rubber hand?

43
00:01:50,965 --> 00:01:52,282
Oh, it's in the dishwasher.

44
00:01:52,343 --> 00:01:54,407
Your father and I were using it for something.

45
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:55,573
Oh, for God's sake.

46
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:58,113
Can't you keep my hand to yourself?!

47
00:01:58,251 --> 00:01:59,864
Huh... used it for something?

48
00:01:59,936 --> 00:02:03,224
He's just jealous that I have a man back in my life.

49
00:02:03,325 --> 00:02:06,034
And guess what else is back?

50
00:02:07,535 --> 00:02:09,070
My breakfast?

51
00:02:09,352 --> 00:02:11,129
My friskiness.

52
00:02:11,251 --> 00:02:13,013
Mama horny, Michael.

53
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:15,173
No it's my breakfast.

54
00:02:15,256 --> 00:02:18,276
I'm amazed Dad hasn't strangled himself with his belt yet.

55
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,375
Oh, we're into all kinds of freaky stuff.

56
00:02:21,445 --> 00:02:23,299
Why don't eat breakfast before I come here?

57
00:02:24,717 --> 00:02:27,052
What the hell is this?!

58
00:02:27,139 --> 00:02:30,830
Well, now that Dad's back, I'm going to perform one grand illusion for him

59
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,237
before he strangles himself with his belt.

60
00:02:33,312 --> 00:02:34,660
No, no, turns out, they're into that.

61
00:02:34,732 --> 00:02:35,516
Oh.

62
00:02:35,607 --> 00:02:36,642
Well, check it.

63
00:02:36,964 --> 00:02:39,108
The illusion is called "Free Bird".

64
00:02:39,386 --> 00:02:41,480
A magical bird-- me in a beak--

65
00:02:41,542 --> 00:02:42,873
stands on a platform.

66
00:02:42,943 --> 00:02:45,320
There's a puff of smoke, and I'm gone.

67
00:02:45,406 --> 00:02:48,587
Then seconds later, high above in a once-empty cage...

68
00:02:48,664 --> 00:02:49,488
who should appear?

69
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,797
- A guy that kind of looks like you? 
- No.

70
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:53,799
That's not how I do the trick.

71
00:02:54,224 --> 00:02:55,443
Even it was,

72
00:02:55,858 --> 00:02:57,185
how'd the look-alike get up there?

73
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,986
- He was hiding behind this mirror here? 
- No!

74
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,206
For your information, Dad asked me to do this

75
00:03:02,263 --> 00:03:05,791
on the day he pleads not guilty as a spectacular protest.

76
00:03:06,006 --> 00:03:08,698
A protestacular.

77
00:03:08,765 --> 00:03:10,753
Maybe even get it on the local news.

78
00:03:10,809 --> 00:03:11,709
Excuse me.

79
00:03:11,985 --> 00:03:13,818
I was just looking for a marker.

80
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,595
A Magic Marker.

81
00:03:17,034 --> 00:03:20,046
I want it out of my living room. Put it in Buster's room.

82
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:22,646
That's where she keeps things she has no need for.

83
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:24,494
Oh, God.

84
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:27,433
I'm going to run this trough again on "pots and pans"

85
00:03:27,515 --> 00:03:31,007
You know, Gob, instead of trying to impress a father that couldn't care less about you,

86
00:03:31,062 --> 00:03:34,713
why don't try spending some time with your son who's dying to reconnect with you?

87
00:03:34,774 --> 00:03:37,914
Gob had discovered he was the father of this boy.

88
00:03:37,965 --> 00:03:40,843
Then just tell him that Steve Hold stopped by okay?

89
00:03:40,909 --> 00:03:41,231
Okay.

90
00:03:41,309 --> 00:03:43,121
He'd been ducking him ever since.

91
00:03:43,689 --> 00:03:45,477
Tom... Come on over here.

92
00:03:45,548 --> 00:03:46,797
I've got a vitamine for you.

93
00:03:46,863 --> 00:03:48,471
Hey, he's the one who can't see me.

94
00:03:48,544 --> 00:03:49,890
'Cause we were hiding in the trick?

95
00:03:49,967 --> 00:03:52,982
Illusion, Michael.

96
00:03:53,407 --> 00:03:56,976
I so very much would like to be in your protestacular.

97
00:03:57,089 --> 00:03:59,136
As your look-alike.

98
00:03:59,715 --> 00:04:01,896
Right. They're going to see the ink.

99
00:04:01,977 --> 00:04:05,689
It's more of a leading man role. But it's *** dye that way.

100
00:04:05,868 --> 00:04:09,352
I guess I shouldn't have used a permanent... marker.

101
00:04:10,974 --> 00:04:12,939
Start to see why you want that divorce.

102
00:04:13,323 --> 00:04:15,716
Yeah... Well actually, I've been thinking.

103
00:04:15,781 --> 00:04:19,243
Instead of spending money on a divorce which can be slow.

104
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,455
No. Maybe I should get something faster?

105
00:04:21,536 --> 00:04:23,171
Not the car. I said no to the Volvo.

106
00:04:23,246 --> 00:04:26,929
The Lexus. The Volvo didn't have satellite radio, which is crazy.

107
00:04:26,989 --> 00:04:28,137
I mean... What are we? Amish?

108
00:04:28,198 --> 00:04:30,122
I knew you wouldn't have the gut to go through with the divorce.

109
00:04:30,184 --> 00:04:33,226
You want to talk? You haven't had a serious relationship since your wife.

110
00:04:33,302 --> 00:04:37,444
And you guys, weren't even speaking toward the end.

111
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:38,848
Lot of that was the coma.

112
00:04:38,924 --> 00:04:41,004
Yeah I've heard your side of it.

113
00:04:41,397 --> 00:04:43,302
You haven't got the guts to meet someone else.

114
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:46,507
Look who finally got his pants on...

115
00:04:47,757 --> 00:04:49,231
You've got ten minutes.

116
00:04:49,691 --> 00:04:51,674
You got to get me out of here.

117
00:04:51,801 --> 00:04:53,532
You're the one that said no to prison.

118
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:56,558
I was wrong. There, you just have it to shut your eyes and take it.

119
00:04:56,603 --> 00:04:58,202
Here, you have shut your eyes and give it.

120
00:04:58,258 --> 00:05:01,038
Now, listen, we can't go in there and plead "not guilty".

121
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,642
We have to have someone big behind us, our own private Matlock.

122
00:05:04,697 --> 00:05:06,557
So I made calls and I got him.

123
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,387
Got who?

124
00:05:07,452 --> 00:05:08,784
Andy Griffith.

125
00:05:08,866 --> 00:05:09,935
What, you never saw Matlock?

126
00:05:09,998 --> 00:05:11,538
Not a real attorney, Dad.

127
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:17,545
Now, for ten grand, he'll actually sit behind us in court and read the paper.

128
00:05:17,595 --> 00:05:20,233
For $15,000, he'll actually sit at the defense table.

129
00:05:20,324 --> 00:05:24,461
For $20,000, he'll twice lean forward

130
00:05:24,527 --> 00:05:27,002
and whisper something in your ear.

131
00:05:27,734 --> 00:05:29,936
Oh. White suit, that's extra.

132
00:05:30,022 --> 00:05:32,874
Boy, that's an awful lot of money for the stupidest idea I've ever heard.

133
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,937
The juries love him.

134
00:05:35,014 --> 00:05:39,096
That's just it, Dad. There won't be a jury because we are pleading guilty.

135
00:05:39,177 --> 00:05:40,324
I am not guil...

136
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,705
All right, I didn't want to tell you this.

137
00:05:42,986 --> 00:05:44,460
Are you ready for the bombshell?

138
00:05:44,559 --> 00:05:45,976
Andy Griffith wasn't the bombshell?

139
00:05:46,037 --> 00:05:47,010
I'm a patsy.

140
00:05:47,087 --> 00:05:48,194
I was set up.

141
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:49,673
By the Brits.

142
00:05:49,796 --> 00:05:53,242
A group of British builders operating outside the O.C...

143
00:05:53,308 --> 00:05:53,917
Don't call it that.

144
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:57,507
...contacted me for a partnership to build homes overseas.

145
00:05:57,567 --> 00:06:00,030
I did not know they meant Iraq.

146
00:06:00,097 --> 00:06:02,423
We've got a picture of you with Saddam Hussein.

147
00:06:03,276 --> 00:06:05,488
I thought that was the guy who played the Soup Nazi.

148
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:08,166
- Come on.
- I told him how much I liked his work.

149
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,987
Anyway, the Brits used that picture to blackmail me.

150
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,701
A picture like that, Michael, can end your career.

151
00:06:13,769 --> 00:06:15,193
Not in every case.

152
00:06:16,078 --> 00:06:17,618
These are dangerous people, Michael.

153
00:06:17,664 --> 00:06:21,018
They'll do whatever it takes to get inside this family and just bring us down.

154
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,083
British people?

155
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:27,080
Oh, they're polite and the men all sound gay, but they will rip out your heart.

156
00:06:27,132 --> 00:06:29,205
And their breath...

157
00:06:29,262 --> 00:06:30,618
And you want to go after these people?

158
00:06:30,675 --> 00:06:32,942
Well, yes, it takes a little courage, Michael.

159
00:06:33,239 --> 00:06:35,140
I know that's not your strongest suit.

160
00:06:35,206 --> 00:06:38,692
You're even scared to ask a girl out on a date.

161
00:06:38,757 --> 00:06:41,488
What? Why does everybody think that I'm scared of girls?

162
00:06:41,545 --> 00:06:42,604
Because you're a chicken.

163
00:06:42,671 --> 00:06:43,664
You're a chicken!

164
00:06:43,726 --> 00:06:45,036
Coo-coo ca-cha!

165
00:06:45,241 --> 00:06:46,685
Coo-coo ca-cha!

166
00:06:47,143 --> 00:06:48,247
What are you doing?

167
00:06:48,318 --> 00:06:51,473
Michael and women?! A-koodle-doodle doo!

168
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:54,062
That's what I was just telling him. Cha! Cha!

169
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:56,940
Look, I haven't found the right girl. When I do, I will ask her out.

170
00:06:57,001 --> 00:06:59,695
Has anyone in this family ever even seen a chicken?

171
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,953
Wait, wait, wait! I got the perfect thing!

172
00:07:02,558 --> 00:07:04,004
That's enough.

173
00:07:04,308 --> 00:07:08,101
I will give it one day, all right? I'll see if there's any evidence of these nefarious Brits,

174
00:07:08,143 --> 00:07:10,713
but I'm warning you, if I can't, we're pleading guilty,

175
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:14,216
and you're either going back to jail or if the judge shows absolutely no mercy at all,

176
00:07:14,262 --> 00:07:15,848
you'll be staying here with my mother.

177
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:19,607
Lindsay, didn't want to tell you earlier, but I did get you a car.

178
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,855
Is it a Lexus?

179
00:07:20,922 --> 00:07:21,987
It's more like a Lincoln.

180
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:25,858
Cock-a-caw! Cock-a-caw! Cock-a-caw!

181
00:07:30,432 --> 00:07:32,095
Oh, come on!

182
00:07:32,729 --> 00:07:35,852
There's no satellite radio, but there's a banjo in the closet.

183
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,095
And watch out for live-ins.

184
00:07:38,178 --> 00:07:39,708
You will get some live-ins.

185
00:07:46,476 --> 00:07:51,774
Michael was investigating his father's case in the English section of Orange County.

186
00:07:51,831 --> 00:07:53,603
Lanes reverse, mate!

187
00:07:53,737 --> 00:07:56,645
You're driving on the wrong side, you blooming idiot!

188
00:07:56,747 --> 00:08:00,421
I need to check the records for any British-owned building businesses

189
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,040
that would've applied for a license about ten years ago.

190
00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:04,515
Oh, I'm so sorry.

191
00:08:04,576 --> 00:08:07,715
You'll need a UK passport to check those files.

192
00:08:07,848 --> 00:08:10,766
They're for British eyes only.

193
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:14,273
Don't I look kind of British?

194
00:08:14,396 --> 00:08:16,388
Perhaps if you're willing to lose 20 pounds.

195
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:20,674
The clerk was asking for a bribe, but this was lost on Michael.

196
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,374
Well, you guys do go for the jugular.

197
00:08:22,434 --> 00:08:24,842
If you find someone with a passport, we're here 'til 8:00.

198
00:08:24,896 --> 00:08:26,438
And do stay for the Poppuns.

199
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:29,228
So Michael went to the local pub...

200
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,263
Bloody Yank!

201
00:08:30,329 --> 00:08:33,120
...to see if he could find someone with a British passport.

202
00:08:33,201 --> 00:08:37,299
Welcome to the Yellowfang. I am Lionel, and the soup of the day is...

203
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:39,321
What's the soup of the day, Mum?!

204
00:08:39,387 --> 00:08:40,144
Bread.

205
00:08:40,217 --> 00:08:42,725
And the soup of the day is bread.

206
00:08:42,807 --> 00:08:44,692
Unless you're just here for the Poppuns.

207
00:08:44,748 --> 00:08:48,803
And that's when Michael saw the most beautiful woman he'd ever seen.

208
00:08:49,179 --> 00:08:50,258
Not her.

209
00:08:50,667 --> 00:08:51,987
Wait for it...

210
00:08:58,863 --> 00:09:01,280
Are you from Wee Britain?

211
00:09:01,347 --> 00:09:03,108
Great Britain, actually.

212
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:06,635
I was wondering if you might be willing to go somewhere with me.

213
00:09:06,702 --> 00:09:08,156
I would pay you.

214
00:09:08,699 --> 00:09:09,559
You'll pay me?

215
00:09:09,626 --> 00:09:10,532
Not...

216
00:09:11,077 --> 00:09:13,696
Not for sex. You're going to think that I'm Jack the Ripper, right?

217
00:09:13,757 --> 00:09:15,667
Didn't he kill prostitutes or...?

218
00:09:15,745 --> 00:09:17,188
I'm not a prostitute.

219
00:09:17,255 --> 00:09:18,950
Then I shall let you live.

220
00:09:20,296 --> 00:09:21,930
This is my worst hello.

221
00:09:22,032 --> 00:09:23,210
Let me try again.

222
00:09:23,408 --> 00:09:24,422
My name is Michael.

223
00:09:24,505 --> 00:09:25,488
Rita.

224
00:09:25,785 --> 00:09:30,280
I need access to these files that are apparently for British eyes only.

225
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:34,663
Well, lucky for you, my whole face is British.

226
00:09:38,186 --> 00:09:40,275
It's just across the street here. I really appreciate...

227
00:09:40,336 --> 00:09:41,965
Hello.I thought you said you were open 'til 8:00.

228
00:09:42,046 --> 00:09:46,106
Oh, yes, GMT. Everything here is on Greenwich Mean Time.

229
00:09:46,593 --> 00:09:48,379
What a curious street.

230
00:09:48,892 --> 00:09:52,900
Rita... I don't suppose that you're here tomorrow morning?

231
00:09:52,976 --> 00:09:54,417
Oh, no, not in the morning, no.

232
00:09:54,488 --> 00:09:56,122
I'll be back at Slowbrooke.

233
00:09:56,198 --> 00:09:59,060
Slowbrooke. The private school? Oh, you teach kids, huh?

234
00:09:59,134 --> 00:10:00,851
I like to think they teach me.

235
00:10:00,929 --> 00:10:03,080
Like what, how to eat crayons, throw tantrums...

236
00:10:03,218 --> 00:10:04,810
Oh, no, not when I'm there.

237
00:10:04,948 --> 00:10:06,361
I'm very good.

238
00:10:06,424 --> 00:10:10,539
I-I didn't mean to, uh, impugn your ability, or, uh...

239
00:10:11,025 --> 00:10:13,483
It's turning into one of my worst good-byes.

240
00:10:13,581 --> 00:10:18,936
Farewell, and, uh... our paths shan't cross again.

241
00:10:19,934 --> 00:10:21,128
As you like it.

242
00:10:21,199 --> 00:10:22,817
Michael would have walked away forever,

243
00:10:22,878 --> 00:10:25,730
but he was struck by something he remembered from his childhood.

244
00:10:25,776 --> 00:10:26,529
You know...

245
00:10:31,734 --> 00:10:34,071
Well... must be the Poppuns.

246
00:10:34,444 --> 00:10:36,918
Oh, I'm sorry. It's wrong to laugh.

247
00:10:36,989 --> 00:10:38,827
No, no, no, it's good. I liked it.

248
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:41,463
It's just, I was going to ask you, preschools just go half-day, right?

249
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:44,695
And I'm not... I'm not trying to pick you up, but is there any way that I can...

250
00:10:44,741 --> 00:10:47,234
I can come by, pick you up, bring you here?

251
00:10:47,306 --> 00:10:48,638
Yeah, I-I, um...

252
00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:51,822
I suppose I could... sneak out at nap time.

253
00:10:51,925 --> 00:10:53,681
Yes? Perfect. Great.

254
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:56,850
And I shall drop you off alive, hooker or no.

255
00:10:59,124 --> 00:11:02,012
Tobias, still hoping to be in Gob's trick,

256
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:04,924
ventured into a costume shop he'd stumbled upon...

257
00:11:05,068 --> 00:11:06,403
Oh! Look who's back.

258
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,391
...years earlier.

259
00:11:07,469 --> 00:11:09,803
Are you going to buy this time, or you just curious?

260
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:12,656
I suppose I'm, uh... buy-curious.

261
00:11:12,789 --> 00:11:14,320
I have a big TV opportunity.

262
00:11:14,396 --> 00:11:16,762
This is where all the big TV's come.

263
00:11:17,085 --> 00:11:19,204
Uh, let's startwith the Eve Arden.

264
00:11:19,297 --> 00:11:20,151
All right.

265
00:11:20,361 --> 00:11:22,516
Michael, meanwhile, called his sister.

266
00:11:22,609 --> 00:11:26,454
I wanted to call and tell you that I got myself a date with a beautiful woman

267
00:11:26,515 --> 00:11:29,817
named Rita, and you're the chicken, not me.

268
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:32,019
Cluck-cluck-cluck-cluck...

269
00:11:32,909 --> 00:11:36,044
Okay, that's a pretty good chicken.

270
00:11:48,784 --> 00:11:49,622
Watch out!

271
00:11:50,114 --> 00:11:51,317
Crazy Brit!

272
00:11:53,328 --> 00:11:54,476
What's the problem?

273
00:11:54,564 --> 00:11:56,360
I know what you were doing back there.

274
00:11:56,468 --> 00:11:59,836
If you've got half a ( bleep ) brain, you'll leave it alone.

275
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:02,648
You talking about back in Wee Britain? I was just asking a few questions.

276
00:12:02,724 --> 00:12:04,583
Yeah, a few too many, if you ask me.

277
00:12:04,659 --> 00:12:08,058
How would you like someone going after some stupid person in your family?

278
00:12:08,116 --> 00:12:10,460
Now, back off, you ( bleep ) ponce!

279
00:12:13,705 --> 00:12:14,660
Wow!

280
00:12:15,681 --> 00:12:17,793
Dad was not kidding about their breath.

281
00:12:19,564 --> 00:12:23,711
Michael had just been threatened by a foul-mouthed British man.

282
00:12:23,931 --> 00:12:25,518
It's Michael. I'm not dressed.

283
00:12:25,586 --> 00:12:27,332
Gob, this is Michael.

284
00:12:28,018 --> 00:12:30,813
Shouldn't you be getting ready for your "Free Bird" trick?

285
00:12:30,936 --> 00:12:32,511
I couldn't get the rights to "Free Bird."

286
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:35,887
I'm thinking about calling it "Free..." I don't know, "Chicken."

287
00:12:36,148 --> 00:12:38,636
I thought you were investigating Dad's sinister British connection.

288
00:12:38,984 --> 00:12:42,302
Yeah, I tried, but... but when I was leaving,

289
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:45,841
one of those British guys came after me and told me to back off.

290
00:12:45,906 --> 00:12:48,765
Can't believe it, but Dad may have been telling the truth. This might be dangerous.

291
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,704
So you came back here to hide like a child.

292
00:12:50,765 --> 00:12:52,630
What are you doing locked in my office, exactly?

293
00:12:52,726 --> 00:12:54,340
Hiding from a child.

294
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:55,363
Big difference.

295
00:12:55,431 --> 00:12:57,770
Gob, Steve Holt is your son. He probably just feels a connection.

296
00:12:57,845 --> 00:12:59,305
He doesn't know what he feels!

297
00:12:59,374 --> 00:13:01,103
I'm tired of being told...

298
00:13:02,731 --> 00:13:05,859
My God, what is this feeling?

299
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,826
Well, you know the-the feeling that you're...

300
00:13:07,882 --> 00:13:11,514
that you're feeling is-is what many of us call "a feeling."

301
00:13:11,599 --> 00:13:14,436
But it's not like envy, or even hungry.

302
00:13:14,672 --> 00:13:16,032
Could it be love?

303
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:18,731
I know what an erection feels like, Michael. No, it's the opposite.

304
00:13:18,788 --> 00:13:21,815
It's... it's like my heart is getting hard.

305
00:13:23,488 --> 00:13:25,583
Maybe I am ready to be a father.

306
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,489
Hey, Dad?

307
00:13:27,692 --> 00:13:29,182
It's my son, Gob.

308
00:13:29,263 --> 00:13:33,299
What is it with the fathers in this family? Always trying to deceive their...

309
00:13:33,386 --> 00:13:38,976
And that's when Michael realized that the man who threatened him must have been hired by George Sr.

310
00:13:39,054 --> 00:13:40,597
I'm the patsy.

311
00:13:41,634 --> 00:13:42,981
Well, I got to go.

312
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,768
George Michael, I'm sorry, but we're going to talk about that girl later, okay?

313
00:13:46,831 --> 00:13:48,642
Now all I have to do is find that look-alike, Michael.

314
00:13:48,721 --> 00:13:49,898
Michael...

315
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,574
Hey!

316
00:13:55,765 --> 00:13:57,116
That's a woman's wig.

317
00:13:57,562 --> 00:13:59,775
I was told it was a "Bob."

318
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:03,845
And Michael confronted his father.

319
00:14:03,928 --> 00:14:04,894
Find out anything?

320
00:14:04,971 --> 00:14:07,352
Yeah, I did, Dad. I found out that no matter how many times I promise myself

321
00:14:07,409 --> 00:14:09,891
that I'm not going to fall for it, I always end up getting hustled by you.

322
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:10,921
What are you talking about?

323
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,900
The guy that you hired to threaten me after I looked into the British connection.

324
00:14:13,963 --> 00:14:15,867
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Somebody threatened you?

325
00:14:15,932 --> 00:14:18,002
That's a wonderful performance, Dad. You're a regular Brad Garrett.

326
00:14:18,043 --> 00:14:21,845
But I don't watch TV at 3:00 in the afternoon. And you can forget about pleading not guilty.

327
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:23,408
Guilty, we got to plead guilty.

328
00:14:23,474 --> 00:14:23,885
What?

329
00:14:23,951 --> 00:14:27,162
Michael, I didn't hire anyone. I-I-I swear.

330
00:14:27,219 --> 00:14:29,798
If someone came after you, they're for real.

331
00:14:29,859 --> 00:14:30,648
Come on, you're serious?

332
00:14:30,715 --> 00:14:32,717
I told you, these are bad guys.

333
00:14:32,783 --> 00:14:35,323
They do not want this information out.

334
00:14:35,384 --> 00:14:38,861
He said that he was going to come after somebody stupid in our family-- that could be Buster.

335
00:14:39,352 --> 00:14:40,724
Could be Gob.

336
00:14:40,996 --> 00:14:42,295
You're not guilty.

337
00:14:42,419 --> 00:14:43,505
We have to plead guilty.

338
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:44,524
We've got to plead guilty.

339
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,689
We've got to throw ourselves on the mercy of the court.

340
00:14:46,971 --> 00:14:49,449
- We got to get Andy Griffith.
- Andy Griffith in the suit.

341
00:14:50,013 --> 00:14:52,720
And Michael went to cancel with Rita.

342
00:14:52,793 --> 00:14:57,176
Sorry. I just wanted to let you know that I'm not going to be needing your passport, after all.

343
00:14:57,242 --> 00:14:59,377
We're just going to go to court, plead guilty-- that'll be that.

344
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:01,410
So it's bye-bye to Rita, then?

345
00:15:01,491 --> 00:15:06,046
Actually, I was wondering if-if you might want to...

346
00:15:06,501 --> 00:15:07,973
I wouldn't.

347
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,960
I'll make you blue.

348
00:15:10,113 --> 00:15:12,985
Rita was just talking about the fingerpaint,

349
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,737
but Michael didn't know that.

350
00:15:14,829 --> 00:15:20,096
I was just wondering if you might want to bid me fair 'morrow.

351
00:15:20,721 --> 00:15:21,976
That's all. See ya.

352
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:23,993
Michael was filled with self-loathing.

353
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:29,457
Had he been Jack the Ripper he would have soothed himself in a most unsavory way.

354
00:15:29,871 --> 00:15:35,049
But instead, he just sat in his car and ate a whole thing of candy beans.

355
00:15:35,447 --> 00:15:39,723
And back at the penthouse, Gob had been called to see his father.

356
00:15:39,789 --> 00:15:42,850
It's a new plan, right? You put me in the trick.

357
00:15:42,917 --> 00:15:44,387
You make me the guy in the cage.

358
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:46,808
Okay, I just got to say I'm really blown away by this.

359
00:15:47,228 --> 00:15:50,162
You really want to be part of my world.

360
00:15:50,246 --> 00:15:50,986
I do.

361
00:15:51,145 --> 00:15:54,115
God, I feel like my heart is straining through my shirt.

362
00:15:54,182 --> 00:15:56,849
They take the ankle monitor off when I get to court,

363
00:15:56,905 --> 00:15:59,798
so you make me disappear, you put Tobias in the cage--

364
00:15:59,865 --> 00:16:02,972
and by the time they realize that that guy is not me,

365
00:16:03,033 --> 00:16:05,620
I'm running through the storm drains to freedom.

366
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,011
Where every day it rains...

367
00:16:08,138 --> 00:16:10,880
pennies from heaven.

368
00:16:14,943 --> 00:16:17,723
It was... "bird" today...

369
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:21,083
Gob, I know you're looking for a twin for your illusion,

370
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:23,483
and there's somebody I'd like to put in a plug for.

371
00:16:23,675 --> 00:16:27,513
Uh, correction-- make that 4,000 plugs.

372
00:16:27,637 --> 00:16:29,228
- Oh, God.
- Oh, come on!

373
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:31,363
Meestagay , he's bleeding! Meestagay...!

374
00:16:31,445 --> 00:16:36,577
No, no, no, no. I-I was scared too, but I realized it was of being a leading man.

375
00:16:36,646 --> 00:16:39,873
Oh, I can just taste those meaty leading man parts in my mouth.

376
00:16:39,934 --> 00:16:43,442
All right, listen to me, the trick has changed. We want you to play me now.

377
00:16:43,513 --> 00:16:45,997
Oh, but that would mean I'd have to sh...

378
00:16:46,831 --> 00:16:50,213
shave my very tender head. I see, okay.

379
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:54,999
Well, perhaps I jumped the gun on those new head shots.

380
00:16:56,074 --> 00:16:58,998
And later that day, Michael arrived at the courthouse.

381
00:16:59,069 --> 00:17:01,296
I can't believe you're just giving up like this.

382
00:17:01,379 --> 00:17:03,522
The guy threatened our family. We have to plead guilty.

383
00:17:03,574 --> 00:17:05,601
No, I'm talking about that girl you said you had a date with.

384
00:17:05,668 --> 00:17:07,813
All right, so I lied-- it wasn't a date.

385
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,221
But you could have made one with her.

386
00:17:09,293 --> 00:17:11,356
I think that Poppuns knocked the courage out of you.

387
00:17:11,433 --> 00:17:13,000
I guess I'm just not in her league.

388
00:17:13,143 --> 00:17:14,766
How did you hear about the Poppuns?

389
00:17:14,853 --> 00:17:15,843
It was on the news.

390
00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:19,277
An unlicensed Mary Poppuns takes down another tourist.

391
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:23,169
Is this the work of the Itsy-Bitsy IRA?

392
00:17:23,296 --> 00:17:26,221
I don't want to talk about this right now. Dad, we're going to go in there--

393
00:17:26,297 --> 00:17:29,426
Andy Griffith's going to whisper something, we're going to plead guilty, nice and simple.

394
00:17:29,497 --> 00:17:31,377
You didn't hear, we lost Andy.

395
00:17:31,436 --> 00:17:32,241
What? What are you talking about?

396
00:17:32,308 --> 00:17:33,433
He didn't like his trailer.

397
00:17:33,526 --> 00:17:35,185
He thought we were making fun of him.

398
00:17:35,261 --> 00:17:37,628
No one was making fun of Andy Griffith.

399
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:40,148
I can't emphasize that enough.

400
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:45,420
Oh, God, don't look now, but Gob's doing his magic show.

401
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:49,261
Oh, boy, a stupid magic show. We got to watch this.

402
00:17:49,352 --> 00:17:50,678
A big turnout.

403
00:17:50,858 --> 00:17:53,136
I think a lot of people are probably here for the free chicken.

404
00:17:53,224 --> 00:17:55,082
Gather 'round, humans...

405
00:17:55,211 --> 00:17:59,128
and I will show you the plight of an innocent man who yearns to be

406
00:17:59,249 --> 00:18:02,993
free... as a bird!

407
00:18:04,237 --> 00:18:06,392
I've got to start labeling these suits.

408
00:18:06,514 --> 00:18:11,709
Who shall I send on this journey to that dangling cage?

409
00:18:11,773 --> 00:18:13,525
Oh, pick me. Oh!

410
00:18:13,621 --> 00:18:16,039
Look, can I be in his stupid trick? Please?

411
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,846
Steve Holt, what are you doing here?

412
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:20,886
I just came to see the magic show.

413
00:18:20,968 --> 00:18:22,187
I didn't know it was you.

414
00:18:22,264 --> 00:18:23,633
Do you like magic?

415
00:18:23,785 --> 00:18:24,916
No.

416
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:26,463
I love it!

417
00:18:26,529 --> 00:18:30,882
And at that moment, Gob chose to show his own son what he was capable of.

418
00:18:30,995 --> 00:18:35,678
I've decided I will be performing the feat myself!

419
00:18:35,745 --> 00:18:37,456
Wait... we're back to hair?

420
00:18:37,532 --> 00:18:39,513
Fortunately for Tobias, however,

421
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,405
he'd found it too painful to part with his new hair.

422
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,652
Boy, did I catch a break.

423
00:18:45,733 --> 00:18:48,074
So he opted to wear a bald cap.

424
00:18:48,151 --> 00:18:52,927
This chicken shall be wrongly cooped.

425
00:18:56,537 --> 00:18:58,670
What's in his hand? Is that chicken?

426
00:18:58,699 --> 00:19:01,320
Oh, my God! Dad, are you all right?

427
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:03,491
I fooled his own son.

428
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,892
I am a leading man.

429
00:19:06,383 --> 00:19:09,593
And Gob himself was running through the storm drains,

430
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:11,887
free as a chicken.

431
00:19:14,191 --> 00:19:17,654
And George Sr. needed to escape, too.

432
00:19:17,725 --> 00:19:18,698
I got him.

433
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:23,151
Keeps him out of the kitchen.

434
00:19:23,582 --> 00:19:27,217
And Michael, seeing what a life of cowardice leads to,

435
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,188
decided he'd had enough of it.

436
00:19:29,276 --> 00:19:33,263
And soon, George came to, and it was time to render a plea.

437
00:19:33,356 --> 00:19:36,279
The prosecution's got that stud from LA Law.

438
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:39,046
I love my trailer.

439
00:19:39,168 --> 00:19:42,419
In the matter the of People v. Bluth, how do you plead?

440
00:19:42,498 --> 00:19:43,673
We plead...

441
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:46,004
not guilty.

442
00:19:48,276 --> 00:19:50,913
- Michael, what are you doing?
- I'm tired of the cowardice.

443
00:19:50,974 --> 00:19:53,550
You're not guilty. We're going to fight this. We've got the truth on our side.

444
00:19:53,611 --> 00:19:55,804
They don't have a ( bleep ) prayer.

445
00:19:57,006 --> 00:19:58,741
Send the check to my accountant.

446
00:19:59,371 --> 00:20:01,629
This is where Andy could have helped us.

447
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:02,841
Well, I'm proud of you.

448
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:04,497
It's about time I showed a little courage.

449
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,113
I just hope those Brits aren't as dangerous as Dad says.

450
00:20:07,185 --> 00:20:10,124
Well, they're not going to get any closer to us. If they do, we're going to see them coming.

451
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,317
Oh, my God.

452
00:20:11,516 --> 00:20:12,596
That's Rita.

453
00:20:12,765 --> 00:20:14,793
I told her I was coming here, and she came.

454
00:20:15,591 --> 00:20:17,531
- That's Rita?
- Yeah.

455
00:20:19,488 --> 00:20:22,745
Wow. She is way out of his league.

456
00:20:24,363 --> 00:20:26,062
I'm glad you're here.

457
00:20:26,206 --> 00:20:28,658
I want to call you sometime and take you out.

458
00:20:28,888 --> 00:20:32,528
Oh, I'd really like that.

459
00:20:32,956 --> 00:20:33,768
Good.

460
00:20:35,758 --> 00:20:38,909
And then just to prove he wasn't a coward,

461
00:20:38,985 --> 00:20:40,833
he went one step further.

462
00:20:45,051 --> 00:20:48,897
And Rita was happy to be in Michael's life, as well.

463
00:20:50,699 --> 00:20:55,027
For you see, Rita... had a secret of her own.

464
00:21:09,623 --> 00:21:14,549
