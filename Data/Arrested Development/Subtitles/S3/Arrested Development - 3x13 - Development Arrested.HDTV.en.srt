1
00:00:01,877 --> 00:00:03,920
This is Michael Bluth.

2
00:00:04,016 --> 00:00:06,306
Right now he's being honored by his family.

3
00:00:06,402 --> 00:00:09,872
Three years ago, I made a choice to keep this family together...

4
00:00:09,969 --> 00:00:11,541
Uh, today looks like I succeeded.

5
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:13,574
So why is this man crying?

6
00:00:14,137 --> 00:00:18,973
Because now he'll have to stay with these people for a long, long time.

7
00:00:23,844 --> 00:00:27,754
Days earlier, Michael awoke to find his son in his bed.

8
00:00:27,856 --> 00:00:29,909
Hey. Are you scared of a monster?

9
00:00:30,445 --> 00:00:31,286
Kind of.

10
00:00:31,397 --> 00:00:33,657
It was the monster called lust,

11
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,526
to which he'd recently succumbed.

12
00:00:35,622 --> 00:00:38,720
And there's a chance you might not even be related to us.

13
00:00:38,836 --> 00:00:41,746
And although he'd only gotten to second base,

14
00:00:41,847 --> 00:00:43,701
he'd gone in head-first

15
00:00:44,191 --> 00:00:45,667
like Pete Rose.

16
00:00:45,728 --> 00:00:48,316
And they both got some distressing news.

17
00:00:48,364 --> 00:00:50,608
And there you are, Maeby, coming out of your mother's third base.

18
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:52,149
You guys really are related.

19
00:00:52,244 --> 00:00:53,190
And that night...

20
00:00:53,295 --> 00:00:54,667
You're not sleeping in here now.

21
00:00:54,777 --> 00:00:56,010
Yeah, you think that's a bad idea?

22
00:00:56,113 --> 00:00:57,868
What, I mean, so we can make out every night?

23
00:00:57,976 --> 00:01:00,097
Does that... not work for your schedule?

24
00:01:00,253 --> 00:01:02,328
I mean, I'm sure we can control our, you know...

25
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,208
I'm going to go sleep with my dad.

26
00:01:05,341 --> 00:01:06,335
Yeah, I'm going to go get my job back.

27
00:01:06,438 --> 00:01:09,044
You're probably just a little anxious because your old man

28
00:01:09,139 --> 00:01:12,469
is about to start running a successful company for a change.

29
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,734
So Pop-Pop is definitely innocent, huh?

30
00:01:14,834 --> 00:01:17,704
No, not by a long shot, but they have dropped all the charges,

31
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,298
and not just the Iraq ones.

32
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,804
The embezzlement, the pension-robbing...

33
00:01:21,901 --> 00:01:23,899
I don't know why they dropped them, but they did.

34
00:01:23,995 --> 00:01:26,801
Let's see if we are on Mad Money, huh?

35
00:01:26,925 --> 00:01:29,183
...And they deliver insulin right to my door!

36
00:01:29,274 --> 00:01:30,704
It's probably on right after this ad.

37
00:01:30,797 --> 00:01:32,268
This is going to be great for us, too.

38
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:34,653
It's going to give us a chance to spend some time together, you know?

39
00:01:34,753 --> 00:01:37,443
It's like I don't even know what's going on in your life right now.

40
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:39,272
Are there any girls or...?

41
00:01:39,684 --> 00:01:43,419
Actually... I've been wrestling with some pretty taboo...

42
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:44,825
Shh-shh! Do you hear this?

43
00:01:45,026 --> 00:01:46,627
They beat the treason charges!

44
00:01:46,723 --> 00:01:48,289
We had it as a "Don't buy."

45
00:01:48,386 --> 00:01:50,798
Let's bump it up to a "Risky!"

46
00:01:50,921 --> 00:01:54,455
Risky! There it is! We're doing it, huh? Are you happy?

47
00:01:54,555 --> 00:01:55,569
I'm really happy.

48
00:01:55,664 --> 00:01:57,478
Hey, I wonder if we should move out of town.

49
00:01:58,469 --> 00:01:59,436
What?

50
00:01:59,508 --> 00:02:02,267
I feel like we've heard this whole "out of the woods" thing a lot,

51
00:02:02,346 --> 00:02:03,686
you know, and-and I just wouldn't mind...

52
00:02:03,777 --> 00:02:05,856
What have I always said is the most important thing?

53
00:02:05,962 --> 00:02:06,994
Family.

54
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:09,261
I was going to say breakfast, but...

55
00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:11,402
Why don't we go over to Gangee's, have a little of both.

56
00:02:11,505 --> 00:02:14,453
Later we can talk all this out, huh?

57
00:02:15,139 --> 00:02:17,255
Well, I've heard that a couple times, too.

58
00:02:18,067 --> 00:02:21,579
And so the family gathered for a celebratory brunch

59
00:02:21,673 --> 00:02:23,117
catered by a local restaurant.

60
00:02:23,216 --> 00:02:27,293
- Hello! 
- Risky, risky, risky, risky!

61
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:31,434
Look at that, Buster. You would've lost a hand anyway.

62
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:33,639
I'd like to make an announcement.

63
00:02:33,765 --> 00:02:36,799
We need to finish the party we started three years ago,

64
00:02:36,902 --> 00:02:41,052
finally name Michael CEO of a thriving company.

65
00:02:43,108 --> 00:02:47,024
We'll prove to the world that nothing can tear apart the Bluth family.

66
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:49,053
In fact, I've already rented the same boat.

67
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:51,928
Oh, I'm not comfortable near the ocean since the seal attack.

68
00:02:52,016 --> 00:02:53,641
The ocean is my second biggest fear.

69
00:02:53,755 --> 00:02:54,559
Good, don't come.

70
00:02:54,673 --> 00:02:57,062
I need to be rubbing elbows, not working your fork.

71
00:02:57,172 --> 00:02:58,204
We'll find a new venue.

72
00:02:58,316 --> 00:03:00,917
Oh, and before I forget, no magic, Gob.

73
00:03:02,522 --> 00:03:03,427
Where is Gob?

74
00:03:03,534 --> 00:03:05,512
Oh, who knows? I don't even know where he lives.

75
00:03:05,608 --> 00:03:06,594
He doesn't live at Michael's?

76
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:08,421
I've always pictured him in a lighthouse.

77
00:03:08,525 --> 00:03:09,025
Doesn't matter.

78
00:03:09,121 --> 00:03:11,317
Mom, I'm just really flattered that you're willing to do this.

79
00:03:11,401 --> 00:03:15,545
And I was half worried that you'd all be eager to sell your shares and cash out.

80
00:03:15,786 --> 00:03:17,404
W-We-we can do that?

81
00:03:17,525 --> 00:03:21,458
Yeah, but... Stan Sitwell's always had a wild hair to buy this business.

82
00:03:21,543 --> 00:03:23,054
It's the only hair he's got.

83
00:03:23,252 --> 00:03:24,017
What?

84
00:03:24,127 --> 00:03:25,386
He's an alpaca.

85
00:03:25,494 --> 00:03:26,519
He has alopecia.

86
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,323
And, Lindsay, you know, if we did sell, it would only mean, like, what, $2 million each?

87
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,607
$2 million, $2 million, $2 million...

88
00:03:33,712 --> 00:03:35,596
It sounds like a lot more than it actually is.

89
00:03:35,703 --> 00:03:37,826
You know, you've already spent $1,200 on eggs.

90
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,402
And that would be it forever.

91
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:42,517
Keep in mind we are building something that is not only for our own kids;

92
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:44,565
it's also for George Michael and Maeby's kids, too.

93
00:03:44,663 --> 00:03:47,479
What? What? We can't have kids! What are you...?

94
00:03:47,573 --> 00:03:49,062
I mean, it's not even an option, really.

95
00:03:49,143 --> 00:03:50,094
Well, eventually, you'll want to.

96
00:03:50,174 --> 00:03:52,738
Sure, I may want to, you know, now. I-It doesn't matter.

97
00:03:52,826 --> 00:03:54,729
Either way, I won't do anything about it.

98
00:03:54,852 --> 00:03:55,476
Come on!

99
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:58,593
Michael's right, and I for one will not go back to wondering

100
00:03:58,676 --> 00:04:01,101
whether there's going to be enough food on the table.

101
00:04:01,444 --> 00:04:03,307
Might want to worry about the table.

102
00:04:03,418 --> 00:04:07,665
It's fine for you to say "Don't sell," but I'm going to be 40 in three years, you know?

103
00:04:07,783 --> 00:04:10,771
You know, being twins, our birthdays are pretty close to one another.

104
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,394
Yeah,  but a 40-year-old woman has as much a chance of getting married

105
00:04:13,496 --> 00:04:15,835
as she does of getting attacked by a shark.

106
00:04:16,582 --> 00:04:18,561
Oh,  I'm sorry. I thought you were going to say "seal."

107
00:04:19,052 --> 00:04:20,792
- Or a seal. 
- Oh, God!

108
00:04:20,934 --> 00:04:22,627
Lindsay, you have nothing to worry about. You're a beautiful woman.

109
00:04:22,727 --> 00:04:24,346
Any man would be lucky to have you.

110
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:27,661
Michael had given this speech many times to Lindsay.

111
00:04:27,787 --> 00:04:29,840
I'm a giant, fat pig.

112
00:04:29,965 --> 00:04:32,292
I don't know why you say stuff like that.

113
00:04:32,395 --> 00:04:34,240
Girls just grow faster than boys.

114
00:04:34,343 --> 00:04:35,374
Dinner's ready.

115
00:04:35,478 --> 00:04:37,760
We're having Lindsay chops.

116
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:42,787
What? I want her to be prepared in case some bully at school is as clever as I am.

117
00:04:42,897 --> 00:04:44,292
No bully ever would be.

118
00:04:44,394 --> 00:04:46,378
Oh, let's not forget: you're already married.

119
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,276
Hey, Mikey.

120
00:04:47,373 --> 00:04:48,155
Yes?

121
00:04:48,274 --> 00:04:49,965
I think I'm going to cash out myself and, uh,

122
00:04:50,069 --> 00:04:51,857
maybe go down to my little place in Cabo.

123
00:04:51,964 --> 00:04:53,364
What little place in Cabo, Dad?

124
00:04:53,454 --> 00:04:56,042
What, did you build yourself a little hideout in case you needed to escape?

125
00:04:56,135 --> 00:04:57,422
Of course not.

126
00:04:58,457 --> 00:04:59,662
Well, I don't want you to worry, Dad.

127
00:04:59,738 --> 00:05:01,974
There's going to be plenty of money to be made from a business run honestly.

128
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,346
Oh... well, your mom's not going to allow for that.

129
00:05:05,462 --> 00:05:07,469
She'll do whatever it takes to get her way.

130
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:10,469
You think the banana stand was our idea?

131
00:05:10,571 --> 00:05:11,237
It wasn't?

132
00:05:11,347 --> 00:05:12,208
It wasn't.

133
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:16,136
Although they marketed the idea better, the frozen banana itself

134
00:05:16,254 --> 00:05:19,796
was the brainchild of a Korean immigrant who threatened to sue them.

135
00:05:19,895 --> 00:05:21,281
Your mother said she'd take care of it.

136
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:23,562
The guy was deported to Korea the next day.

137
00:05:23,679 --> 00:05:25,390
Where his business never recovered.

138
00:05:25,504 --> 00:05:28,834
You're trying to tell me that all your crimes, all your dishonesty--

139
00:05:29,048 --> 00:05:30,047
she was behind it all?

140
00:05:30,167 --> 00:05:31,579
She's the queen, Michael.

141
00:05:31,684 --> 00:05:33,971
I was her king, but now it's you.

142
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,011
She may appear all sweet and innocent and light, but she has a way of, uh,

143
00:05:37,107 --> 00:05:39,118
controlling your behavior,

144
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,836
and I'm concerned about you because I do not want to see...

145
00:05:41,862 --> 00:05:43,450
- He'll be fine.
- You'll be fine.

146
00:05:48,346 --> 00:05:52,886
Michael went to cancel the reservation on the party boat Buster so feared...

147
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:53,531
Gob!

148
00:05:53,627 --> 00:05:55,778
...when he saw Gob on a party boat of his own.

149
00:05:55,874 --> 00:05:57,954
You might want to untie these ropes first.

150
00:05:58,048 --> 00:05:59,794
Don't tell me how to flee, Michael.

151
00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:00,749
What are you doing here?

152
00:06:00,847 --> 00:06:02,719
Well, I... kind of live here.

153
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:04,635
Lighthouse wasn't far off.

154
00:06:04,741 --> 00:06:06,564
Perhaps you can tell me how you can afford a boat.

155
00:06:06,652 --> 00:06:09,051
You mean on the, uh, paltry $1,500 a week you give me?

156
00:06:09,163 --> 00:06:10,517
Uh, I give you $500 a week.

157
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:12,846
Somebody's drawing a little "one" on those checks.

158
00:06:12,993 --> 00:06:14,065
No big deal.

159
00:06:14,191 --> 00:06:16,923
I plan on using my Bluth Company stock to pay for it.

160
00:06:17,056 --> 00:06:19,265
Sitwell's made me a pretty nice little offer.

161
00:06:19,363 --> 00:06:21,280
About that, Gob-- you cannot sell now.

162
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:22,095
I have to.

163
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:24,450
Gob, you're going to burn through this money and have nothing, all right?

164
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,871
"You give a man a fish, he'll eat for a night.

165
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:27,967
If you teach a man to fish..."

166
00:06:28,082 --> 00:06:31,198
He'll want to use your yacht, and I don't want this thing smelling like fish.

167
00:06:31,237 --> 00:06:32,520
I'm burning through my future for it.

168
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:34,975
But you wouldn't understand that because you're a robot.

169
00:06:35,092 --> 00:06:38,938
Although I don't suppose you'd be willing to have the company buy it?

170
00:06:40,165 --> 00:06:42,395
Well, you can't let Gob sell those shares.

171
00:06:42,497 --> 00:06:44,252
Well, what am I supposed to do? He won't give up the yacht.

172
00:06:44,351 --> 00:06:45,475
Just keep your weight off it.

173
00:06:45,595 --> 00:06:46,978
So lease it to him through the company.

174
00:06:47,076 --> 00:06:48,723
Yeah, that just doesn't feel right.

175
00:06:48,888 --> 00:06:49,798
Oh, really?

176
00:06:49,898 --> 00:06:52,512
How would it feel to lose the company to a man

177
00:06:52,607 --> 00:06:55,618
who has less hair on his ( bleep ) than I have on my ( bleep )?

178
00:06:55,727 --> 00:06:57,668
It can't be worse than hearing that just was.

179
00:06:57,776 --> 00:07:00,355
I guess I couldn't see through the glasses, and I slid into the ladder...

180
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:01,772
Give  Gob the boat.

181
00:07:01,881 --> 00:07:05,619
We need to show the shareholders at this party that the family is united.

182
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:09,924
It's a very small concession to a important cause.

183
00:07:10,031 --> 00:07:12,668
And so Michael sold out just a little.

184
00:07:12,771 --> 00:07:14,954
Fine, I will give him the yacht.

185
00:07:16,844 --> 00:07:17,493
Hey, Dad.

186
00:07:17,586 --> 00:07:18,521
Hey, pal.

187
00:07:18,645 --> 00:07:20,256
Well, you said we could... we could talk later.

188
00:07:20,365 --> 00:07:22,383
Yeah. You excited about the party?

189
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,549
I actually might even just skip that.

190
00:07:24,659 --> 00:07:28,237
What are you talking about? This party is essential for the stockholders to see.

191
00:07:28,332 --> 00:07:30,973
I mean, we got to show them how close this family really is.

192
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:34,509
And this was as good an opening as George Michael was going to get.

193
00:07:34,603 --> 00:07:36,079
Maeby and I made out.

194
00:07:36,398 --> 00:07:37,150
I'm sorry?

195
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:38,181
Me, too.

196
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:40,003
What-what do you mean, son?

197
00:07:40,102 --> 00:07:41,024
You kissed?

198
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,925
Even a little more than that.

199
00:07:43,684 --> 00:07:45,740
I thought she wasn't my real cousin,

200
00:07:45,843 --> 00:07:48,587
but then Uncle Tobias showed us these really rough pictures

201
00:07:48,678 --> 00:07:51,123
that proved that she was really Aunt Lindsay's daughter.

202
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:54,808
I just feel like I can't be around her or Aunt Lindsay.

203
00:07:55,011 --> 00:07:57,419
They were really rough... pictures.

204
00:07:57,517 --> 00:08:00,492
No, I remember their birth announcement like it was yesterday.

205
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,778
I mean, I know it's wrong, you know, but, uh, my feelings are real even...

206
00:08:05,966 --> 00:08:07,173
even if it was a mistake.

207
00:08:07,267 --> 00:08:11,064
Well, obviously, acting on those feelings is not an option.

208
00:08:11,177 --> 00:08:12,686
She's a blood relative.

209
00:08:13,078 --> 00:08:13,982
I know.

210
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:16,125
I've seen the blood.

211
00:08:16,283 --> 00:08:17,967
Now, how long has this been going on?

212
00:08:18,069 --> 00:08:20,332
I don't know... 53 weeks?

213
00:08:20,428 --> 00:08:22,689
I can't be around her with these feelings anymore,

214
00:08:22,774 --> 00:08:25,236
and that's why I'm-I'm not going to this party.

215
00:08:25,337 --> 00:08:29,643
And so Michael made another compromise of his values for the sake of the business.

216
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:33,062
Whatever happened to that Ann we were both so crazy about?

217
00:08:33,157 --> 00:08:35,385
You know, maybe you can bring her to the party.

218
00:08:35,726 --> 00:08:36,770
Yeah...

219
00:08:37,337 --> 00:08:38,876
Ann is the girl for us.

220
00:08:39,384 --> 00:08:43,154
Michael's  sister, meanwhile, was doing some selling out of her own.

221
00:08:43,274 --> 00:08:44,804
...I'm not going to sell my five percent,

222
00:08:44,889 --> 00:08:46,774
even though you haven't made an offer...

223
00:08:46,864 --> 00:08:49,461
which would be how much, by the way?

224
00:08:49,552 --> 00:08:50,393
Five percent?

225
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,333
Lucille actually gave you less than her natural children?

226
00:08:53,451 --> 00:08:57,200
I hope that's not a crack about my hair color, lips, forehead, nose and teeth.

227
00:08:57,295 --> 00:09:00,292
Because at least I'm not wearing a rayon sweater set on my face.

228
00:09:00,395 --> 00:09:01,623
It's alpaca, actually.

229
00:09:01,725 --> 00:09:03,844
Cruelty-free really narrows your choices.

230
00:09:03,942 --> 00:09:07,699
But that's not what I meant when I said "natural child."

231
00:09:07,849 --> 00:09:09,891
Wait a minute, you're saying...

232
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,107
I'm adopted?

233
00:09:11,216 --> 00:09:12,808
I'm sorry. I thought you knew.

234
00:09:12,921 --> 00:09:13,807
Have  I upset you?

235
00:09:13,918 --> 00:09:14,827
Are you kidding me?

236
00:09:14,957 --> 00:09:17,656
This is the happiest I've been since the day I got my new nose!

237
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:19,035
I'm not a Bluth!

238
00:09:19,137 --> 00:09:20,530
You were almost a Sitwell,

239
00:09:20,637 --> 00:09:23,942
but 37 years ago, the Bluths adopted you out from under us.

240
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:27,331
So we said good-bye to you-- our darling little three-year-old...

241
00:09:27,432 --> 00:09:28,944
Uh, wait, "three-year-old"?

242
00:09:29,025 --> 00:09:31,023
Uh, you said it was 37 years ago.

243
00:09:31,129 --> 00:09:32,262
Oh, yeah, right.

244
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,640
Hey, we should do something for your 40th next week.

245
00:09:34,733 --> 00:09:37,541
This part of the news Lindsay didn't take that well.

246
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,854
Be gentle! She's almost 40!

247
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,982
Maeby, meanwhile, had returned to Tantamount Studios,

248
00:09:48,078 --> 00:09:51,164
where word was, she was to be replaced

249
00:09:51,265 --> 00:09:54,558
when it was discovered she wasn't the age she claimed to be.

250
00:09:54,663 --> 00:09:55,657
Please don't fire me.

251
00:09:55,755 --> 00:09:57,484
Fire you? Are you kidding?

252
00:09:57,587 --> 00:10:00,387
I've already gotten ten requests for the TV rights to your story.

253
00:10:00,484 --> 00:10:03,203
You got to get your family to sign the release papers.

254
00:10:03,308 --> 00:10:06,112
This is the biggest thing to happen since Uniprod hired

255
00:10:06,202 --> 00:10:08,888
that wee-brain to run Drama Development.

256
00:10:11,396 --> 00:10:15,437
Michael had compromised his morals, and was having trouble sleeping.

257
00:10:15,691 --> 00:10:17,864
Of course, some of that was Lindsay.

258
00:10:19,388 --> 00:10:20,302
Are you drunk?

259
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,373
A little.

260
00:10:21,493 --> 00:10:22,663
We need to talk.

261
00:10:22,763 --> 00:10:26,427
Yeah, I'll say. Are you aware that your daughter and my son have been getting physical?

262
00:10:26,511 --> 00:10:28,903
I mean, can you imagine anything that inappropriate?

263
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:30,993
Whoa. I guess you can. What are you doing?

264
00:10:31,094 --> 00:10:32,318
- I'm not your sister.
- What?

265
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:33,658
- I'm adopted.
- Wait, Lindsay...

266
00:10:33,749 --> 00:10:34,810
And I'm three years older.

267
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,867
Hey, there must be some mistake.

268
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,443
No. Mom confirmed it.

269
00:10:37,538 --> 00:10:39,265
And I know you've always found me attractive.

270
00:10:39,367 --> 00:10:42,372
You've been telling me that for the last 40 years.

271
00:10:42,489 --> 00:10:44,356
Wait, Lindsay. This is crazy.

272
00:10:44,471 --> 00:10:46,469
If I don't get divorced and remarry in the next month,

273
00:10:46,569 --> 00:10:49,291
I'm going to sell those shares, and I'm gonna cash out.

274
00:10:49,396 --> 00:10:50,342
So, what do you say?

275
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:53,074
But even Michael couldn't sell out that much.

276
00:10:53,176 --> 00:10:55,848
I'm just not that into older women.

277
00:10:58,276 --> 00:10:59,726
You bastard!

278
00:11:02,368 --> 00:11:05,712
Michael had just found out his sister was adopted.

279
00:11:05,814 --> 00:11:08,393
And the next morning, he awoke to a worse surprise.

280
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:09,742
Oh, come on.

281
00:11:09,834 --> 00:11:12,089
Well, I can't sleep in the same room as her.

282
00:11:12,316 --> 00:11:14,566
She wants out of this marriage, fine.

283
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:18,171
I-I'm afraid I'm going to have to sell the Bluth shares and move on.

284
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:20,024
You can't do that.

285
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,200
They're my shares.

286
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:23,786
No, I mean, you can't spoon me like that.

287
00:11:26,428 --> 00:11:30,694
We need a new venue for the shareholders' party, and it cannot be a boat.

288
00:11:30,797 --> 00:11:33,552
Now, if you can find something,

289
00:11:33,746 --> 00:11:36,745
maybe I can fudge the books, get you a Bluth Company salary, huh?

290
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,702
Maybe call you an events coordinator.

291
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:41,088
Can we just lay here for a second while I think about it?

292
00:11:41,196 --> 00:11:44,391
Michael was making compromises all over the place.

293
00:11:44,485 --> 00:11:45,466
Sure.

294
00:11:48,128 --> 00:11:49,784
- I'll do it.
- Sounds great.

295
00:11:50,726 --> 00:11:54,376
Soon, George Michael went to Ann's to try to win her back.

296
00:11:54,477 --> 00:11:58,372
But her Uncle Paul told him that Ann had moved in with her boyfriend.

297
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,827
He also mentioned that we all only had three more weeks on earth,

298
00:12:01,926 --> 00:12:06,125
and that fossils were just something the Jews buried in 1924.

299
00:12:06,222 --> 00:12:08,373
And so, feeling that he couldn't go home,

300
00:12:08,469 --> 00:12:12,577
George Michael decided to seek out his own creepy uncle,

301
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,382
and Michael confronted his mother about the adoption.

302
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,406
Look, she was better off with us.

303
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,691
He wanted to call her Nellie.

304
00:12:18,794 --> 00:12:19,460
Of course.

305
00:12:19,595 --> 00:12:21,322
Lindsay is a Nellie from the photo.

306
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:23,603
Why didn't you just tell people that she was adopted?

307
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:26,849
Adopting a child we didn't want just to stick it to a competitor.

308
00:12:26,937 --> 00:12:28,337
Well, that'd make us look great.

309
00:12:28,429 --> 00:12:29,410
You're right, Mom.

310
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,642
People would have twisted that story to make you look bad.

311
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,897
I don't see what the big deal is.

312
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,984
We loved her just as much as any of you normal kids.

313
00:12:37,074 --> 00:12:38,330
More than Gob.

314
00:12:38,433 --> 00:12:41,386
The big deal, Mom, is that the family is falling apart.

315
00:12:41,496 --> 00:12:43,683
They're trying to sell their stock, and I can't promise you

316
00:12:43,798 --> 00:12:46,307
that I can keep everyone together until the party.

317
00:12:46,989 --> 00:12:48,279
We'll pay them off.

318
00:12:48,396 --> 00:12:51,403
We'll call it an accrued cash dividend,

319
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:55,410
but they don't get their money until sign a document at the party

320
00:12:55,527 --> 00:12:57,709
promising not to sell for ten years.

321
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,998
So, it's embezzlement, bribery and conspiracy?

322
00:13:00,108 --> 00:13:02,428
And a whole lot of love.

323
00:13:02,856 --> 00:13:04,115
Oh, yeah...

324
00:13:05,149 --> 00:13:06,671
Oh, Michael.

325
00:13:06,757 --> 00:13:08,175
Hey. Oh.

326
00:13:08,274 --> 00:13:11,739
I booked the perfect location and some wonderful performers for the party.

327
00:13:11,831 --> 00:13:13,995
We're having it at the Queen Mary.

328
00:13:14,609 --> 00:13:15,672
Queen Mary?

329
00:13:15,782 --> 00:13:16,740
That's a ship!

330
00:13:16,844 --> 00:13:19,440
Oh, no, no, no. It's a chain of popular nightclubs.

331
00:13:19,528 --> 00:13:21,184
Although I haven't been to this particular location.

332
00:13:21,282 --> 00:13:23,425
It's on the Long Beach Harbor.

333
00:13:23,522 --> 00:13:24,400
That's the ship.

334
00:13:24,491 --> 00:13:26,951
Buster, don't worry about it. They've actually welded it to the dock.

335
00:13:27,025 --> 00:13:29,177
Although, perhaps I should call the "Hot Cops"

336
00:13:29,269 --> 00:13:32,622
and tell them to come up with something more nautically themed.

337
00:13:32,733 --> 00:13:34,280
Hot Sailors.

338
00:13:34,386 --> 00:13:36,334
Better yet, Hot Seam...

339
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:38,599
I like Hot Sailors.

340
00:13:38,705 --> 00:13:40,284
Hmm. Me, too.

341
00:13:40,631 --> 00:13:44,753
And George Michael was about to come across a hot seaman of his own.

342
00:13:44,809 --> 00:13:45,468
Uncle Gob?

343
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:46,607
What are you doing here?

344
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:47,554
How'd you find me?

345
00:13:47,662 --> 00:13:50,348
My Dad said that you were living down here with your girlfriend.

346
00:13:51,636 --> 00:13:52,742
You know about her?

347
00:13:52,847 --> 00:13:53,563
Who?

348
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:54,686
Ann.

349
00:13:57,818 --> 00:13:58,674
Her?

350
00:13:58,792 --> 00:14:04,196
Gob had been dating Ann since he awarded her third place in an inner-beauty pageant.

351
00:14:04,305 --> 00:14:09,089
Since then, Ann and her friends tried to teach Gob about the Holy Trinity...

352
00:14:09,613 --> 00:14:11,552
What? I thought that's what all you guys lived for!

353
00:14:11,657 --> 00:14:14,163
...while Gob debased everything they believed in.

354
00:14:14,281 --> 00:14:15,388
What about you? You game?

355
00:14:15,823 --> 00:14:17,660
It's really not that big of a deal, George Michael.

356
00:14:17,768 --> 00:14:20,535
I'm 18 now, and besides, we really haven't even done anything.

357
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:22,073
Practically nothing.

358
00:14:22,859 --> 00:14:24,132
But what are you going to do?

359
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,788
The girl obviously needs a man.

360
00:14:25,894 --> 00:14:27,927
And that's when George Michael became one.

361
00:14:29,271 --> 00:14:30,832
Ann was upset.

362
00:14:33,094 --> 00:14:37,177
As was Buster when he saw the ship where the party was to be held.

363
00:14:40,111 --> 00:14:43,152
And so Michael accepted his congratulations,

364
00:14:43,259 --> 00:14:45,617
all the while looking for his son.

365
00:14:45,722 --> 00:14:48,869
And Buster was approached by his loving father.

366
00:14:48,975 --> 00:14:51,607
Do  you think there's any chance this ship could break away from the dock?

367
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:52,968
We're on a ship?

368
00:14:53,073 --> 00:14:58,050
And Maeby was trying to get the family to sign away the TV rights to their life stories.

369
00:14:58,161 --> 00:15:00,703
TV is not as good as it used to be, huh, Uncle Buster?

370
00:15:00,814 --> 00:15:03,765
But you can help me out by signing my petition to make it better.

371
00:15:03,855 --> 00:15:06,555
Oh, I kind of like Skating with Celebrities. Excuse me.

372
00:15:06,667 --> 00:15:08,774
And Lucille was trying to get signatures, too.

373
00:15:08,821 --> 00:15:10,761
Sign here that you won't sell.

374
00:15:10,859 --> 00:15:12,470
Oh, I don't need to sell, Lucille.

375
00:15:12,596 --> 00:15:15,387
Because now  I know that we're not related, I'm going to marry Michael.

376
00:15:15,511 --> 00:15:17,436
I always saw him with a younger girl.

377
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:21,636
And Gob, angry at Michael for sending his son to the docks...

378
00:15:21,739 --> 00:15:22,958
We're not related?

379
00:15:23,054 --> 00:15:26,617
...went into a kind of knee-jerk revenge mode.

380
00:15:26,738 --> 00:15:30,506
Why go for the best when you can go for the rest?

381
00:15:31,234 --> 00:15:34,234
Of your life with a younger man?

382
00:15:35,979 --> 00:15:37,928
Kitty likes to scratch.

383
00:15:39,411 --> 00:15:41,512
Mom! Mom!

384
00:15:44,107 --> 00:15:49,493
Take these forms to everyone in the family and promise them 100 grand if they sign.

385
00:15:49,593 --> 00:15:53,597
And that's how Maeby found a way to get signatures on her release forms.

386
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:55,543
Well, that was a freebie.

387
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:58,840
And soon the crowd gathered to hear Michael.

388
00:15:58,947 --> 00:16:02,969
I just want to say how much this family really means to me.

389
00:16:03,227 --> 00:16:05,693
My father has always been there for me.

390
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,436
He's a great man.

391
00:16:08,502 --> 00:16:13,266
My brother Gob, who I know would never do anything to hurt anyone in this family.

392
00:16:13,363 --> 00:16:15,923
Except for dating his nephew's girlfriend

393
00:16:16,022 --> 00:16:18,439
and hitting on his adopted sister.

394
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:22,411
Buster, who faced his biggest fear to be here today.

395
00:16:22,517 --> 00:16:23,869
Second biggest.

396
00:16:23,969 --> 00:16:25,337
And my sister, Lindsay.

397
00:16:25,441 --> 00:16:29,681
Yes, she is my sister, no matter what uh, any piece of paper says.

398
00:16:29,914 --> 00:16:32,031
Lindsay and her husband, Tobias.

399
00:16:32,153 --> 00:16:36,694
You know, deep down, they-they both love each other very, very much.

400
00:16:36,802 --> 00:16:41,257
Most of all, my mother, who has always believed in me.

401
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:44,025
Uh, three years ago, I made a choice...

402
00:16:47,493 --> 00:16:50,914
I made a choice to keep this family together.

403
00:16:51,109 --> 00:16:54,369
And that's when Michael finally cried.

404
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:56,803
Uh, today looks like I succeeded.

405
00:16:58,593 --> 00:17:01,276
It wasn't exactly a turn-on.

406
00:17:07,242 --> 00:17:08,867
( bleep ) baby.

407
00:17:09,249 --> 00:17:11,511
It looks like George Michael got his mom back today, huh?

408
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:13,481
Yeah, well, where is George Michael, by the way?

409
00:17:13,585 --> 00:17:15,682
He came by the yacht, and gave me this shiner.

410
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,992
He hit you? What for?

411
00:17:17,092 --> 00:17:18,013
You know teenagers.

412
00:17:18,126 --> 00:17:20,152
Probably lashing out at you because of who I'm dating.

413
00:17:20,201 --> 00:17:20,849
Who are you dating?

414
00:17:21,246 --> 00:17:22,386
Ann.

415
00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:23,582
Her?

416
00:17:23,681 --> 00:17:24,961
Don't worry. I didn't fight back or anything.

417
00:17:25,054 --> 00:17:27,084
I was, like, "Oh, no, take the yacht. Please don't hurt me."

418
00:17:27,173 --> 00:17:29,220
You know, just build up the little guy's self-esteem.

419
00:17:29,331 --> 00:17:30,330
The yacht?

420
00:17:30,422 --> 00:17:33,387
Oh, for God's sake, Gob. I've got to get off this ship.

421
00:17:33,494 --> 00:17:35,597
Mom, George Michael took off in Gob's yacht.

422
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:36,386
I got to go find him.

423
00:17:36,495 --> 00:17:37,665
Well, you can't go now.

424
00:17:37,789 --> 00:17:39,822
That's not going to look good in front of the investors.

425
00:17:39,927 --> 00:17:41,136
Mom, this is important, okay?

426
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,801
Michael, this company is important.

427
00:17:43,902 --> 00:17:48,483
It was at that moment that Michael realized how much he'd sold out.

428
00:17:50,382 --> 00:17:52,668
Never seen a CEO cry like that before.

429
00:17:52,774 --> 00:17:53,927
Except at a sentencing.

430
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,641
That's who you're putting in charge?

431
00:17:55,872 --> 00:17:58,437
I've made a huge mistake.

432
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:01,280
Will you take the company for 20% above market?

433
00:18:01,385 --> 00:18:03,940
Ten, and I'll take the company off your hands right now.

434
00:18:04,051 --> 00:18:05,684
15, and I'll throw in Nellie.

435
00:18:05,789 --> 00:18:06,580
She's 40.

436
00:18:06,688 --> 00:18:07,661
12.

437
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:12,292
Meanwhile, Michael searched the harbor and spotted the yacht.

438
00:18:13,955 --> 00:18:16,434
And Gob noticed something, too.

439
00:18:18,792 --> 00:18:20,845
Are those police boats?

440
00:18:20,942 --> 00:18:22,868
Oh, my God. It's the SEC.

441
00:18:23,002 --> 00:18:23,866
They still have boats?

442
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:24,849
Prepare to be boarded.

443
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:26,962
- Did you do this?
- No.

444
00:18:27,057 --> 00:18:30,946
But I can't help but enjoy the irony that you might be losing three years off your life.

445
00:18:31,064 --> 00:18:34,985
Ah. This is why they dropped those other charges.

446
00:18:35,087 --> 00:18:36,891
You gave me up, George.

447
00:18:36,993 --> 00:18:38,006
George? I'm not George.

448
00:18:38,116 --> 00:18:40,672
George invited me. Oh, stupid.

449
00:18:40,794 --> 00:18:44,479
Oscar, when are you going to learn there's no such thing as free shrimp?

450
00:18:44,593 --> 00:18:47,621
Well, I know it was someone in this family.

451
00:18:47,732 --> 00:18:50,153
Or someone who used to be.

452
00:18:51,471 --> 00:18:53,106
- Annyong?
- Annyong.

453
00:18:53,205 --> 00:18:54,428
- Annyong?
- Annyong.

454
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:57,392
But my real name is Hel-loh.

455
00:18:57,565 --> 00:18:59,174
- Hello?
- Annyong.

456
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:00,856
What the hell did you do this for?

457
00:19:00,966 --> 00:19:03,648
Because my grandfather vowed one day

458
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:06,365
he would get even for banana stand you stole from him.

459
00:19:06,463 --> 00:19:07,459
It was true.

460
00:19:07,553 --> 00:19:13,396
Hel-loh had gathered information against Lucille to avenge his grandfather.

461
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,755
Hey, Maeby ever mention my name?

462
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:18,381
But Lucille was not going peacefully.

463
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,609
You boys know how to shovel coal?

464
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,351
I don't even want to tell you what these guys thought that meant.

465
00:19:24,801 --> 00:19:27,199
And Michael caught up with his son.

466
00:19:27,808 --> 00:19:29,879
George Michael, what are you doing? Where are you going?

467
00:19:29,994 --> 00:19:32,919
I can't stay here. Ann's moved on. Maeby's my cousin.

468
00:19:33,021 --> 00:19:34,659
And we both know that's not an option.

469
00:19:35,596 --> 00:19:37,977
Buddy, Maeby is not your cousin.

470
00:19:38,979 --> 00:19:39,685
What?

471
00:19:39,802 --> 00:19:41,912
Yeah, I found out a couple of days ago.

472
00:19:42,031 --> 00:19:44,173
Aunt Lindsay was adopted.

473
00:19:45,344 --> 00:19:46,729
Why didn't you tell me this?

474
00:19:46,851 --> 00:19:48,922
Because you can't be with Maeby.

475
00:19:49,024 --> 00:19:51,419
You're 15, and so, inevitably,

476
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:53,858
the relationship is gonna fall apart, and then, what do you do?

477
00:19:53,967 --> 00:19:57,427
I mean, she might not be a blood relative, but she is still family,

478
00:19:57,547 --> 00:20:00,024
and that's a bond that lasts forever.

479
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:02,085
You don't want to rock that boat.

480
00:20:03,267 --> 00:20:04,266
What the hell was that?

481
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,960
It was his mother, who moments earlier had taken control of another Queen.

482
00:20:09,078 --> 00:20:11,243
Full steam, boys!

483
00:20:11,363 --> 00:20:12,501
This is degrading.

484
00:20:12,615 --> 00:20:14,019
I thought we were going to strip.

485
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,308
Mother?

486
00:20:17,294 --> 00:20:20,579
Oh. It's moving. It's moving.

487
00:20:20,742 --> 00:20:22,569
I've got to get off. I've got to get off.

488
00:20:23,227 --> 00:20:26,359
And Buster faced his second biggest fear.

489
00:20:26,473 --> 00:20:27,616
I can't swim.

490
00:20:27,733 --> 00:20:29,191
And then his first.

491
00:20:32,503 --> 00:20:33,957
Oh, come on!

492
00:20:34,057 --> 00:20:37,180
And the two grand ladies made their escape together.

493
00:20:37,276 --> 00:20:41,160
Lucille Bluth, please pull over and step away from the historic ship.

494
00:20:41,261 --> 00:20:42,864
I think Gangee's trying to make a break for it.

495
00:20:42,972 --> 00:20:45,276
Well, I guess we should go back. Family sticks together, huh?

496
00:20:45,396 --> 00:20:46,449
Yeah.

497
00:20:46,598 --> 00:20:49,366
On the other hand, we do have a full tank of gas,

498
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:53,066
a house in Cabo, and 500 grand in cashier's checks.

499
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:56,519
What say we give them no choice

500
00:20:56,619 --> 00:21:00,719
but to keep themselves all together for a while?

501
00:21:02,512 --> 00:21:04,614
It was Arrested Development.

502
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:08,207
On the epilogue...

503
00:21:09,112 --> 00:21:14,207
Michael wakes up to another strange bedfellow after his first night at sea.

504
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:15,738
How was the party?

505
00:21:16,434 --> 00:21:20,987
And Maeby pitches her TV show to a Hollywood icon who says...

506
00:21:21,081 --> 00:21:24,428
No, I, uh... I don't see it as a series.

507
00:21:25,738 --> 00:21:27,210
Maybe a movie.

508
00:21:27,301 --> 00:21:28,304
