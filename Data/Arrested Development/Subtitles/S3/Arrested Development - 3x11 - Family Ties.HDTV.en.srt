1
00:00:01,296 --> 00:00:03,351
It's... Arrested Development.

2
00:00:04,419 --> 00:00:07,916
Michael Bluth believed he'd just made a shocking discovery.

3
00:00:07,994 --> 00:00:10,728
That might be an older sister that we've never met.

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:13,272
Wow! Look at the beak on that bird.

5
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,532
Michael found the picture in a secret room

6
00:00:15,613 --> 00:00:18,812
while looking for incriminating evidence against his father.

7
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:20,626
I have an older sister?

8
00:00:20,714 --> 00:00:22,828
Don't you kind of remember having an older sister?

9
00:00:22,917 --> 00:00:24,086
Not at all. What? Do you?

10
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,374
A little bit. You know, I mean, Nellie does sound familiar.

11
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,596
Mom and Dad clearly were trying to keep this hidden from us.

12
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:31,730
But this could be anybody. This could be a deformed neighbor or...

13
00:00:31,826 --> 00:00:34,576
A child that Mom and Dad gave up for some reason,

14
00:00:34,663 --> 00:00:37,131
and whose identity they're now using to pin their crimes on.

15
00:00:37,212 --> 00:00:38,760
You know, the prosecutor said that there was

16
00:00:38,843 --> 00:00:41,575
that account with money in it labeled "N. Bluth."

17
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:42,572
Her name is Nellie.

18
00:00:42,678 --> 00:00:44,683
Michael, do you remember when you thought there was

19
00:00:44,751 --> 00:00:47,026
a mysterious "Mr. F" out to get you?

20
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,397
Mr. F...

21
00:00:48,483 --> 00:00:50,795
Yeah, but that was retard... misguided.

22
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:53,025
This is different. This is "N. Bluth."

23
00:00:53,112 --> 00:00:54,088
Different.

24
00:00:54,174 --> 00:00:57,299
Well, why don't you just go to Dad and ask him who Nellie is, point-blank?

25
00:00:57,325 --> 00:00:58,891
So he can just cover it up and lie?

26
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:01,441
I can't stand to hear one more lie out of this family.

27
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,125
Oh, there's the woman I'm sexually attracted to.

28
00:01:05,245 --> 00:01:06,648
Okay, but that's the last one.

29
00:01:06,897 --> 00:01:09,651
Well, I'm off to the the gym to prepare for our tryst.

30
00:01:09,735 --> 00:01:10,469
Tryst?

31
00:01:10,624 --> 00:01:14,312
Yes. Lindsay and I are planning a night of heterosexual intercourse.

32
00:01:14,416 --> 00:01:15,545
You can just say intercourse.

33
00:01:15,628 --> 00:01:17,271
We talked about it last night.

34
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,052
After a disappointing attempt at lovemaking.

35
00:01:20,144 --> 00:01:23,469
Aw, this isn't going to happen. I just want you to be satisfied.

36
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:25,742
Oh, T, you're always thinking of others.

37
00:01:25,822 --> 00:01:27,866
I tried that. It didn't work either.

38
00:01:27,952 --> 00:01:32,152
Well, you know, maybe I would be more attracted to you if you were in better shape.

39
00:01:32,235 --> 00:01:35,088
You know, if were just more muscular and masculine.

40
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:36,421
Does that make me shallow?

41
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:39,720
No. I was going to say the same thing to you.

42
00:01:39,829 --> 00:01:42,092
Maybe we should take a little time to work on ourselves,

43
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:45,916
and then we'll plan a special night in seven or eight days.

44
00:01:45,998 --> 00:01:46,980
Or a couple of weeks.

45
00:01:47,067 --> 00:01:48,178
Let's say three weeks.

46
00:01:48,265 --> 00:01:49,263
We're going to go for it in a month.

47
00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:50,595
Starting at the start of next month.

48
00:01:50,681 --> 00:01:52,775
And we're going to call it a 31-day month.

49
00:01:52,861 --> 00:01:54,901
Even though this particular month has 30 days.

50
00:01:54,985 --> 00:01:57,777
Oh, you know what? I've already prepared a list of "won'ts."

51
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,454
Oh, you're not going to believe this.

52
00:01:59,534 --> 00:02:01,095
My list of "can'ts."

53
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:03,345
Marital love can be so romantic.

54
00:02:03,427 --> 00:02:04,699
What's that supposed to mean?

55
00:02:04,851 --> 00:02:06,324
- What? 
- Marital love.

56
00:02:06,407 --> 00:02:07,928
You were looking right at me, and you said "marital love."

57
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:09,216
I don't... Why would I...?

58
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:12,324
George Michael was interested because, earlier that day,

59
00:02:12,396 --> 00:02:16,871
he'd discovered that the recent mock wedding he'd acted in with his cousin Maeby...

60
00:02:16,953 --> 00:02:17,776
We're married?

61
00:02:17,845 --> 00:02:21,095
...was, in fact, as real and binding as the rice pudding

62
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:23,545
the disoriented patients had thrown at them.

63
00:02:23,621 --> 00:02:24,936
I was talking to your aunt and uncle.

64
00:02:25,004 --> 00:02:27,938
Oh. Oh, of course. They're married, too.

65
00:02:28,384 --> 00:02:29,078
Each other.

66
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:33,290
Oh, please. Pity the fool who gives me a bunch of jibber-jabber about romance.

67
00:02:33,368 --> 00:02:36,342
My religious girlfriend just dumped me, and for a simple little misunderstanding.

68
00:02:36,428 --> 00:02:38,926
I mean, if someone was always asking you to embrace the Holy Trinity,

69
00:02:39,002 --> 00:02:40,103
what would you think they meant?

70
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,546
Gob thought it meant a three-way.

71
00:02:42,766 --> 00:02:45,159
What? I thought that's what all you guys lived for.

72
00:02:47,221 --> 00:02:48,481
What about you? You game?

73
00:02:48,565 --> 00:02:50,022
Well, maybe she just wasn't for you.

74
00:02:50,097 --> 00:02:51,113
Which one?

75
00:02:51,252 --> 00:02:53,108
I don't know. I really wasn't paying attention.

76
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,634
The real problem is, she keeps saying that God is going to show me a sign.

77
00:02:56,779 --> 00:03:00,376
The... something of my ways.

78
00:03:00,595 --> 00:03:01,617
Wisdom?

79
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,988
It's probably wisdom.

80
00:03:03,067 --> 00:03:06,969
Gob, listen. Can I ask you a question? Do you remember growing up with a sister?

81
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:10,757
Sister? Uh... No, I don't.

82
00:03:10,835 --> 00:03:13,126
Not really... ringing any bells.

83
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:14,257
Other than Lindsay, of course.

84
00:03:14,348 --> 00:03:15,517
Oh! Lindsay!

85
00:03:16,935 --> 00:03:18,901
Well, you might not be the most reputable source on this.

86
00:03:18,986 --> 00:03:22,637
Upstairs, George Michael was sharing his news with his cousin.

87
00:03:22,711 --> 00:03:23,926
You mean we're married?

88
00:03:24,009 --> 00:03:25,866
No. It's just a piece of paper. It doesn't mean anything.

89
00:03:25,951 --> 00:03:27,422
- I mean... 
- We should shred it.

90
00:03:27,518 --> 00:03:29,425
- It's creeping me out.
- Yeah. Me...

91
00:03:29,571 --> 00:03:32,859
But, if we just put it over the dresser, like we think it's a joke,

92
00:03:32,934 --> 00:03:35,034
- and we would always know...
- It is a joke.

93
00:03:35,122 --> 00:03:37,287
I know. Unless we get it framed.

94
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:41,478
And Michael went to investigate his mystery sister.

95
00:03:41,559 --> 00:03:43,399
Michael! What a surprise.

96
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:45,005
Really? Were you expecting somebody else?

97
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,946
Maybe, uh... one of your two daughters?

98
00:03:48,017 --> 00:03:50,826
Oh, Lindsay and Tobias never visit.

99
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,185
Oh, we're so bad!

100
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:56,682
I... I actually meant Lindsay and Nellie.

101
00:03:56,942 --> 00:03:59,043
You call him that, too?

102
00:03:59,202 --> 00:04:01,745
It's so nice to be able to talk like this.

103
00:04:01,823 --> 00:04:02,863
Where's Dad?

104
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:03,879
What's  all this?

105
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,371
Computer stuff from the office.

106
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:08,199
No,  no. No, no, Pop. You're not doing another one of those Black Fridays, are you?

107
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:09,752
Your mass firings?

108
00:04:09,844 --> 00:04:12,431
Before firing his employees, however,

109
00:04:12,524 --> 00:04:15,693
George Sr. had been sure to clear the office of its valuables.

110
00:04:15,782 --> 00:04:17,875
So, when do we get to see our new, fancy office?

111
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,952
Soon as you get your new, fancy job.

112
00:04:20,452 --> 00:04:21,434
You're all fired.

113
00:04:21,554 --> 00:04:23,661
The employees never saw it coming,

114
00:04:23,773 --> 00:04:28,630
even though their first task was often to unload computers from a rental truck.

115
00:04:28,909 --> 00:04:32,118
No, it's not a Black Friday, although I did enjoy those.

116
00:04:32,207 --> 00:04:35,318
No, the prosecution is going to want to have access to the hard drive,

117
00:04:35,392 --> 00:04:38,567
so I just want to make sure everything is nice and clean for them.

118
00:04:39,314 --> 00:04:40,205
What the hell is that thing?

119
00:04:40,317 --> 00:04:43,463
An electromagnet. Think of it as a giant delete key.

120
00:04:43,552 --> 00:04:44,934
Well, I hate to spoil your fun, Dad,

121
00:04:45,046 --> 00:04:48,578
but I got backup son all of that stuff, and this is illegal.

122
00:04:48,658 --> 00:04:54,792
Oh, well, excuse me, Judge Reinhold, but I am trying to protect my family.

123
00:04:56,251 --> 00:04:58,592
That's not a real gold necklace, is it?

124
00:04:58,693 --> 00:05:01,746
Well, it wasn't really your 50th birthday.

125
00:05:02,143 --> 00:05:04,177
You know, Dad, you can't have this stuff in here, all right?

126
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,963
And we don't need more trouble.

127
00:05:06,045 --> 00:05:09,860
It's bad enough you got Buster faking a coma just so he doesn't have to testify.

128
00:05:09,938 --> 00:05:12,043
I've been trying to get him out of that coma.

129
00:05:12,127 --> 00:05:15,050
It's costing us a fortune. He's sleeping us dry.

130
00:05:15,146 --> 00:05:19,090
Okay, faker, I'm cutting the cord.

131
00:05:19,205 --> 00:05:21,156
I'll see you at the snack machine.

132
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:26,012
If he knows that you don't want him in the coma, then why is he still in it?

133
00:05:26,107 --> 00:05:27,982
For some reason he won't tell me.

134
00:05:28,111 --> 00:05:30,130
He had fallen for his day nurse.

135
00:05:30,323 --> 00:05:31,835
You're so dear.

136
00:05:31,936 --> 00:05:36,024
She found his complete lack of personality and movement enchanting.

137
00:05:36,137 --> 00:05:37,734
I wish you would say something.

138
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:40,713
Of course, if you did, everything would be ruined

139
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:43,036
'cause you wouldn't be as pure.

140
00:05:43,207 --> 00:05:45,376
Speaking of living a lie, I don't suppose either one of you

141
00:05:45,455 --> 00:05:47,907
have remembered who this N. Bluth is, huh?

142
00:05:48,004 --> 00:05:50,461
Not a Nick or a Nellie?

143
00:05:50,546 --> 00:05:52,417
Just the one who married Lindsay.

144
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,986
Oh, it isn't fun to talk like this?

145
00:05:58,642 --> 00:06:02,490
So Michael returned to the office where the atmosphere was paranoid.

146
00:06:02,586 --> 00:06:03,386
Is it Black Friday?

147
00:06:03,453 --> 00:06:05,138
No one's getting fired. No one's getting fired.

148
00:06:05,224 --> 00:06:07,246
But we haven't been paid, and they took our computers.

149
00:06:07,336 --> 00:06:08,916
I know how this looks bad, but it's just my father trying

150
00:06:08,996 --> 00:06:11,390
to erase all the hard drives to avoid conviction.

151
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:13,789
The company is fine. This is fun, though, isn't it?

152
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,862
They brought out all the old machines.

153
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,538
I mean, they've seen better days, but I'm sure they're all functional, right?

154
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:20,886
Like Tom here.

155
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:22,307
I'm 30.

156
00:06:22,386 --> 00:06:23,592
You're kidding me!

157
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:27,552
But Michael found the equipment frustrating as well.

158
00:06:27,655 --> 00:06:29,275
"Gob's Program"?

159
00:06:31,407 --> 00:06:32,253
Idiot.

160
00:06:32,363 --> 00:06:34,752
And then he noticed something else.

161
00:06:37,308 --> 00:06:37,865
"Nellie."

162
00:06:37,903 --> 00:06:40,819
Michael, got to talk... Oh, wow.

163
00:06:41,043 --> 00:06:42,524
K-Y Pro, huh?

164
00:06:42,648 --> 00:06:44,532
Hey, don't get any moisture on these bab...

165
00:06:44,616 --> 00:06:45,087
Hey.

166
00:06:45,743 --> 00:06:48,952
Tobias... buddy, I needed that information.

167
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,910
This is that sister I been looking for.

168
00:06:51,006 --> 00:06:54,034
Well, just hit, uh, print screen. I'm sure that...

169
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:55,026
Oh, look at that.

170
00:06:58,667 --> 00:07:00,477
Kind of remember these being faster, you know?

171
00:07:00,547 --> 00:07:04,971
Yeah, well, we were probably all so jacked up on amyl and disco music, we didn't notice.

172
00:07:05,055 --> 00:07:06,815
But you know what? I'm glad about this printer lag,

173
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:10,509
because I was hoping to have a jaw session with you.

174
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,533
Well, why don't we just say--as long as that means a talk.

175
00:07:12,601 --> 00:07:15,671
I find myself attracted to someone...

176
00:07:15,926 --> 00:07:17,307
who is not my wife.

177
00:07:17,405 --> 00:07:18,643
What's her name?

178
00:07:18,862 --> 00:07:20,001
Michael.

179
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:22,510
Can you believe it?

180
00:07:23,046 --> 00:07:24,099
You're  married to my sister.

181
00:07:24,218 --> 00:07:25,447
Don't you think I know that?!

182
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:28,219
I-I'm not interested in you that way.

183
00:07:28,306 --> 00:07:29,040
What way?

184
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:30,066
Pick one.

185
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:33,147
No. No, did you think you were the Michael I was talking about?

186
00:07:33,237 --> 00:07:35,193
- Wh-Wha...?
- No, no...

187
00:07:35,277 --> 00:07:38,898
Interesting that your mind went there, though. Okay, uh, no.

188
00:07:38,971 --> 00:07:42,388
Uh, I'm afraid the Michael I'm talking about is all lady.

189
00:07:42,483 --> 00:07:43,923
She's the trainer at my gym.

190
00:07:44,008 --> 00:07:45,313
The trainer you started with today?

191
00:07:45,408 --> 00:07:47,942
Indeed. Can you believe she's a body builder?

192
00:07:48,011 --> 00:07:48,930
Indeed.

193
00:07:49,063 --> 00:07:51,265
What am I doing? What am I doing? What am I doing?

194
00:07:51,348 --> 00:07:54,391
You're nervous about becoming intimate with Lindsay again.

195
00:07:54,484 --> 00:07:56,456
You probably should not rush into things, you know?

196
00:07:56,545 --> 00:07:58,507
Don't call this girl Michael.

197
00:07:58,598 --> 00:08:00,794
Stay away from the gym. Just leave it alone.

198
00:08:00,882 --> 00:08:02,737
Wise words, Boy Michael.

199
00:08:02,842 --> 00:08:05,839
I'll tell you, if I wasn't so dripping and disgustingly sweaty right now,

200
00:08:05,928 --> 00:08:08,741
I'd hop over this desk and give you such a hug.

201
00:08:08,842 --> 00:08:10,945
Hey, coulda, shoulda, woulda.

202
00:08:11,051 --> 00:08:12,999
Hey, hey. No, no. Ooh, look, number's up.

203
00:08:15,004 --> 00:08:16,669
Well, it would've been a seven.

204
00:08:16,864 --> 00:08:20,397
Later that night, Lucille visited Buster in the hospital.

205
00:08:20,487 --> 00:08:21,595
What the hell is this?

206
00:08:21,684 --> 00:08:24,479
My name is Representative John Van Heusen,

207
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:27,687
and I am here to protect the dignity of this boy's life.

208
00:08:27,781 --> 00:08:29,757
Dignity? Easy for you to say--

209
00:08:29,849 --> 00:08:31,739
I'm the one who has to loofah his stump.

210
00:08:31,829 --> 00:08:34,110
I believe death is wrong in all of its forms.

211
00:08:34,206 --> 00:08:38,128
Except lethal injection, but that's just as a deterrent against more death.

212
00:08:38,221 --> 00:08:41,189
And this young man is enjoying life!

213
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:43,049
Hey! Hey! Huh?

214
00:08:43,129 --> 00:08:45,513
Hey, look us, huh? We're having a blast here.

215
00:08:45,603 --> 00:08:48,542
How the hell'd you even find out about Sleeping Beauty here?

216
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:51,903
It was an anonymous tip from someone who cares about Buster's life.

217
00:08:51,992 --> 00:08:53,970
It's not ringing any bells.

218
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:55,973
In fact, it was Buster himself.

219
00:08:56,058 --> 00:08:58,694
They're trying to kill Baby Buster.

220
00:08:58,841 --> 00:09:00,775
Oh,  that's right-- from the videos.

221
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:04,225
Well, no one's killing Baby Buster on my watch.

222
00:09:04,321 --> 00:09:07,595
That is unless, of course, it's as a penalty in a three-strike scenario.

223
00:09:07,687 --> 00:09:11,918
No one's called him Baby Buster since high school.

224
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:15,719
Michael, meanwhile, had called one number after another

225
00:09:15,804 --> 00:09:20,133
until he found Frank, a colleague of the woman he knew as Nellie.

226
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,507
Yeah, well, she's working a software convention at some hotel.

227
00:09:23,621 --> 00:09:25,744
I could set up a meeting at the bar, man.

228
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:26,654
Appreciate it.

229
00:09:26,788 --> 00:09:32,117
And so Michael arrived at the bar hoping to spot someone who could be his sister.

230
00:09:35,219 --> 00:09:36,906
She grew into the nose.

231
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,951
Nellie? Hey, hi.

232
00:09:39,062 --> 00:09:40,461
Michael. Frank sent me.

233
00:09:40,567 --> 00:09:42,406
I think I might be interested in your services.

234
00:09:42,509 --> 00:09:43,511
You  won't be sorry.

235
00:09:43,615 --> 00:09:46,278
Yeah? I was hoping that maybe we could just talk a little bit first, huh?

236
00:09:46,368 --> 00:09:47,716
Yeah, most people want to.

237
00:09:47,812 --> 00:09:49,109
And they did talk,

238
00:09:49,232 --> 00:09:53,589
and Michael felt a connection like he'd never felt with anyone in his family.

239
00:09:53,692 --> 00:09:57,092
I had a locker on the first floor, freshman year, right next to the caf,

240
00:09:57,184 --> 00:10:00,777
with all the junior lockers so it was clearly a mistake, but I didn't say anything.

241
00:10:00,863 --> 00:10:01,870
Ooh, you're bad.

242
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:04,347
I had that same locker all throughout the sophomore year.

243
00:10:04,443 --> 00:10:07,161
Junior year, they had me up on the third floor with all the frosh.

244
00:10:07,253 --> 00:10:08,082
That is wild.

245
00:10:08,183 --> 00:10:10,985
Had the same combo all throughout, because they...

246
00:10:11,238 --> 00:10:13,893
Hey, let's see what some of the other folks are up to.

247
00:10:16,134 --> 00:10:17,124
Nothing there.

248
00:10:19,637 --> 00:10:20,851
Or there.

249
00:10:24,462 --> 00:10:25,537
Oh, my.

250
00:10:25,796 --> 00:10:27,344
Let's get back to Michael.

251
00:10:27,452 --> 00:10:30,501
Okay, because it was Joe Namath's number, Babe Ruth's number then my birthday.

252
00:10:30,609 --> 00:10:32,417
That is a great story.

253
00:10:32,521 --> 00:10:34,069
It wasn't a great story.

254
00:10:34,182 --> 00:10:36,059
Nellie was just a great listener.

255
00:10:36,185 --> 00:10:37,755
Most prostitutes are.

256
00:10:37,863 --> 00:10:41,540
Nellie, the hell with formalities. I think you and I should do business together.

257
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,881
Me, too.

258
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:53,209
Michael had just hired a woman he secretly believed to be his sister.

259
00:10:53,313 --> 00:10:55,091
How did you get into this line of work?

260
00:10:55,189 --> 00:10:58,618
But of course, he'd also yet to figure out she was a prostitute.

261
00:10:58,723 --> 00:11:01,342
Well, I was buried in loan debt from business school,

262
00:11:01,435 --> 00:11:03,190
so I started whoring myself out.

263
00:11:03,281 --> 00:11:04,905
Not that there weren't clues.

264
00:11:05,005 --> 00:11:07,909
What do you say we go up to my room and seal the deal?

265
00:11:08,006 --> 00:11:08,885
You're staying here, huh?

266
00:11:08,989 --> 00:11:10,763
I was actually hoping to get into your business tomorrow

267
00:11:10,872 --> 00:11:13,641
and it would give you a chance to meet everybody in the office, you know,

268
00:11:13,686 --> 00:11:15,086
because you're going to be working for the whole staff.

269
00:11:15,117 --> 00:11:16,539
You'd be filling, like, three openings.

270
00:11:16,631 --> 00:11:20,860
Oh. I heard there were a couple of girls like me consulting over at Enron.

271
00:11:20,945 --> 00:11:25,229
And so, the next day, Michael introduced his new consultant to his staff,

272
00:11:25,322 --> 00:11:26,695
who weren't that pleased to meet her.

273
00:11:26,801 --> 00:11:28,966
- You hired someone else?
- Yes.

274
00:11:29,072 --> 00:11:30,687
We haven't even been paid yet.

275
00:11:30,771 --> 00:11:32,945
That's exactly why I hired her, to help out with the finances.

276
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,051
She's absolutely amazing at that stuff, right?

277
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,958
You do do finances and stuff, right?

278
00:11:37,043 --> 00:11:38,924
I do all sorts of scenes.

279
00:11:39,085 --> 00:11:42,935
There you go. Okay, guys, don't be afraid to put her in any position that you want, okay?

280
00:11:43,015 --> 00:11:46,516
Dave, you give her access to everything, okay?

281
00:11:46,604 --> 00:11:49,228
I want you guys to think of her as Nellie Bluth, all right?

282
00:11:49,317 --> 00:11:52,849
In fact, we should probably get an I.D. with that printed on it, okay?

283
00:11:52,932 --> 00:11:55,152
But she did have a list of won'ts.

284
00:11:55,237 --> 00:11:57,196
We're gonna have some ground rules first, okay?

285
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:01,455
No ( bleep )( bleep )( bleep )  or ( bleep ).

286
00:12:01,538 --> 00:12:05,166
And no ( bleep ) unless you're wearing a ( bleep )

287
00:12:05,253 --> 00:12:06,996
or you ( bleep )( bleep ) me.

288
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:11,235
If this winds up on the Web, I will ( bleep ) you in the ( bleep ).

289
00:12:11,924 --> 00:12:14,477
Our computers don't even work on the Internet.

290
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:15,734
Who's first?

291
00:12:16,465 --> 00:12:18,892
Back at the model home, George Michael was still trying

292
00:12:18,967 --> 00:12:21,246
to make his accidental marriage work.

293
00:12:21,329 --> 00:12:25,038
Hey, I thought tonight we could pop in ( bleep ) in the old DVD player

294
00:12:25,228 --> 00:12:28,145
and sit and watch it maybe just the two of us, husband and wife?

295
00:12:28,431 --> 00:12:29,511
I'm just kidding.

296
00:12:29,687 --> 00:12:31,817
The State of California isn't, but...

297
00:12:31,902 --> 00:12:32,851
You know, that's what makes it funny.

298
00:12:32,966 --> 00:12:35,691
I'm worried you're taking this too seriously.

299
00:12:35,804 --> 00:12:37,754
Just the opposite.

300
00:12:43,248 --> 00:12:44,422
What the hell is that?

301
00:12:44,528 --> 00:12:46,887
I bought you a weddingring... tone.

302
00:12:48,686 --> 00:12:50,154
Opposite of serious.

303
00:12:50,256 --> 00:12:53,476
And Michael was getting an update on how his newest employee,

304
00:12:53,573 --> 00:12:54,937
Nellie, was working out.

305
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:58,568
Really? And all the guys like her, huh? That is, that is, that is great.

306
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:01,095
Uh, you mean "away," though, right?

307
00:13:01,194 --> 00:13:04,124
Because otherwise it sounds a little different, but, uh,

308
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:06,491
that's, uh, that's outstanding.

309
00:13:06,865 --> 00:13:08,481
You forgot to say "away" again.

310
00:13:08,571 --> 00:13:11,712
But listen, let me call you back in a bit, okay? Bye.

311
00:13:12,732 --> 00:13:15,594
Nellie has blown them all away.

312
00:13:15,675 --> 00:13:17,046
Yeah, well, I think it's crazy.

313
00:13:17,135 --> 00:13:20,317
You've given her access to everything-- the banking and for what?

314
00:13:20,406 --> 00:13:22,000
I mean, you're basing this whole thing on the fact

315
00:13:22,085 --> 00:13:24,450
that she shares a name with someone you played with as a baby.

316
00:13:24,539 --> 00:13:26,348
Lindsay, I can tell that it's real.

317
00:13:26,418 --> 00:13:29,060
It's like that feeling that you read about twins having.

318
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,477
We're twins. You didn't give me access to the banking.

319
00:13:31,558 --> 00:13:35,023
No, you'd just, you'd go out and you'd just whore it up, Lindsay, you know?

320
00:13:35,107 --> 00:13:37,227
Now she's different. She's a little bit more like me.

321
00:13:37,304 --> 00:13:39,505
- It's like we finish each other's...
- Sandwiches?

322
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,715
Sentences.

323
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,488
- Why would I say...?
- Sandwiches?

324
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,681
That time I was going to say sandwiches.

325
00:13:47,358 --> 00:13:49,279
So I guess you haven't told Nellie what you're thinking.

326
00:13:49,368 --> 00:13:51,064
No, I have not. I've been waiting for the right time.

327
00:13:51,141 --> 00:13:52,608
I want to make sure that she trusts me, you know.

328
00:13:52,701 --> 00:13:55,009
Especially since Dad is probably setting her up.

329
00:13:55,102 --> 00:13:57,540
But I might want to hurry with that whole operation

330
00:13:57,621 --> 00:13:59,785
because she's charging us a fortune, and of course,

331
00:13:59,869 --> 00:14:02,099
she's got this old boss that's claiming he wants a percentage.

332
00:14:02,181 --> 00:14:03,860
Yo, man, you owe me money.

333
00:14:03,942 --> 00:14:05,017
I ain't no dummy.

334
00:14:05,085 --> 00:14:08,893
It better be soon or you're going to feel my hand up your ( bleep ).

335
00:14:08,971 --> 00:14:11,658
So Nellie wants to meet me tonight for drinks. Maybe I'll tell her then.

336
00:14:11,734 --> 00:14:13,686
That's funny. I'm going out tonight for drinks, too,

337
00:14:13,761 --> 00:14:15,367
with an exciting new man.

338
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:16,979
Really trying to make that marriage work, aren't you?

339
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:21,025
Well, excuse me, Judge Reinhold, but I'm feeling a little pressure here.

340
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,058
I mean, if you had to have sex with Tobias in four months,

341
00:14:23,126 --> 00:14:24,756
you'd be shopping for a way out, too.

342
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:25,834
I stand corrected.

343
00:14:25,923 --> 00:14:27,165
And disgusted.

344
00:14:27,806 --> 00:14:30,236
And Michael arrived for his meeting with Nellie.

345
00:14:30,318 --> 00:14:31,348
- Are you Michael? 
- Yes.

346
00:14:31,432 --> 00:14:33,449
There's a Nellie at the end of the bar who wants to see you.

347
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:34,637
Great. Thank you.

348
00:14:35,367 --> 00:14:36,779
Oh, it's Tobias.

349
00:14:36,863 --> 00:14:38,961
Michael, look, this has got to stop.

350
00:14:39,057 --> 00:14:42,346
I mean, flattered? Yes. Interested? Not tonight.

351
00:14:42,426 --> 00:14:46,364
I-I think I see what's happening. You're meeting girl Michael at the bar?

352
00:14:46,454 --> 00:14:49,486
It was her idea. She wanted to get a drink. I know it's crazy.

353
00:14:49,586 --> 00:14:52,439
I mean, I'm married. And the carbs!

354
00:14:52,542 --> 00:14:55,908
That's why sometimes life is about making difficult...

355
00:14:55,993 --> 00:14:57,869
Sandwiches. I know.

356
00:14:57,964 --> 00:14:59,047
You read my mind.

357
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:00,527
Oh, God, here she is.

358
00:15:02,682 --> 00:15:03,790
Next to that guy?

359
00:15:04,021 --> 00:15:05,161
What guy?

360
00:15:05,813 --> 00:15:06,930
That guy.

361
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:08,730
No, that's her.

362
00:15:09,717 --> 00:15:10,787
Him?

363
00:15:10,894 --> 00:15:12,307
That's a girl.

364
00:15:12,477 --> 00:15:15,664
I think the name "Michael" is making you look for a man.

365
00:15:15,753 --> 00:15:16,881
I think I'm looking at a man.

366
00:15:17,395 --> 00:15:18,092
M ichael.

367
00:15:18,187 --> 00:15:19,339
- Yes?
- Yes?

368
00:15:19,436 --> 00:15:20,871
No, I meant girl Michael.

369
00:15:20,974 --> 00:15:22,577
I'm gonna leave you two alone.

370
00:15:22,683 --> 00:15:24,775
So nice to meet you, girl Michael.

371
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:27,550
Hello? Yes? Hi, Nellie.

372
00:15:27,653 --> 00:15:30,367
I was thinking that we could meet down here, um...

373
00:15:30,495 --> 00:15:32,390
Actually, I think I'm going to come up.

374
00:15:32,768 --> 00:15:34,352
I really need to see you.

375
00:15:34,436 --> 00:15:35,898
Yeah, I really wanted to see you, too.

376
00:15:35,992 --> 00:15:37,229
There's something we need to talk about.

377
00:15:37,316 --> 00:15:39,304
I've always been mildly attracted to you.

378
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:39,875
What?

379
00:15:39,987 --> 00:15:42,971
Let's face it. There's no denying that there's a heat between us.

380
00:15:43,137 --> 00:15:44,578
I'd like to deny that.

381
00:15:44,685 --> 00:15:45,783
I know you feel it, too.

382
00:15:45,886 --> 00:15:47,097
This burning desire.

383
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,647
I-I-I don't feel anything. I feel a burning mutual respect.

384
00:15:50,746 --> 00:15:54,067
I've got an outfit that's going to turn that respect into something fun.

385
00:15:54,163 --> 00:15:55,130
Respect is fun.

386
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:58,286
Nellie, you know, you're going to want the respect when you hear what I...

387
00:15:58,397 --> 00:15:59,361
Where is the light?

388
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:00,711
Don't touch that light.

389
00:16:00,805 --> 00:16:01,250
What?

390
00:16:01,384 --> 00:16:04,952
This is what happens when you steal from Frank's stable without paying.

391
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,312
You want to be her pimp?

392
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:07,264
You got to settle up.

393
00:16:07,372 --> 00:16:09,386
Pimp? You mean that she's...?

394
00:16:09,487 --> 00:16:11,894
A lady of the evening. Working girl.

395
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,061
She turns illusions for money...

396
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,378
And that's when Michael recognized the voice.

397
00:16:16,471 --> 00:16:17,146
...tricks.

398
00:16:17,231 --> 00:16:17,884
Wait a minute.

399
00:16:17,973 --> 00:16:20,978
Don't you do it! Ain't nobody going to see what Frank look like!

400
00:16:21,082 --> 00:16:23,502
Franklin is Frank?

401
00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:25,334
Mr. F.

402
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:30,787
Michael had just discovered that his brother was the pimp

403
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:32,805
for the woman he thought was his sister.

404
00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:35,520
What the hell is going on? Nellie is not a prostitute.

405
00:16:35,616 --> 00:16:36,754
Of course she is.

406
00:16:36,836 --> 00:16:39,312
Oh, but I can see where the misunderstanding is. You didn't know.

407
00:16:39,394 --> 00:16:41,414
Maybe we can give him a family discount.

408
00:16:41,511 --> 00:16:44,751
Family discount is right, Gob. This is the sister that I've been talking about.

409
00:16:44,844 --> 00:16:47,233
Maybe I should have been getting a family rate.

410
00:16:47,395 --> 00:16:48,209
Oh, my God.

411
00:16:48,315 --> 00:16:49,719
How do you know her?

412
00:16:49,896 --> 00:16:51,272
Met up with her after a show.

413
00:16:51,363 --> 00:16:52,500
And you did things with her?

414
00:16:52,581 --> 00:16:53,341
He didn't.

415
00:16:53,448 --> 00:16:54,518
I did.

416
00:16:54,598 --> 00:16:57,365
Well, if you consider crying like a girl doing something.

417
00:16:57,452 --> 00:17:00,050
I just want my brother to respect me, you know?

418
00:17:00,132 --> 00:17:02,085
I mean, I don't even have a job.

419
00:17:02,201 --> 00:17:04,221
Look, I could use a man's voice on the phone.

420
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,857
And I like your little puppet show.

421
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:10,087
I ain't so little when I take my pants off, lady.

422
00:17:11,171 --> 00:17:13,281
Honestly I'd take some of the cry out of that.

423
00:17:13,409 --> 00:17:15,612
But I am not a pimp, Michael.

424
00:17:15,713 --> 00:17:16,959
She needed protection.

425
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:19,707
So I make some threats, wear this hat,

426
00:17:19,797 --> 00:17:21,593
and I collect my ten percent.

427
00:17:21,686 --> 00:17:22,775
Yeah, that's a pimp.

428
00:17:22,874 --> 00:17:25,298
And our sister is a prostitute.

429
00:17:25,406 --> 00:17:26,693
I'm your sister?

430
00:17:26,801 --> 00:17:27,651
I think so.

431
00:17:27,753 --> 00:17:29,161
I found you in my dad's computer,

432
00:17:29,254 --> 00:17:32,690
and I thought that maybe he was embezzling money and taking advantage of you.

433
00:17:32,786 --> 00:17:34,990
That's why I hired you to do your work at the office.

434
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:36,333
Oh, my God.

435
00:17:36,435 --> 00:17:38,684
What kind of work did you do?

436
00:17:38,773 --> 00:17:41,030
No wonder they were so happy.

437
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,941
I'm so embarrassed.

438
00:17:43,056 --> 00:17:44,743
Nellie, hang on a second.

439
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:49,427
You know, Gob, this might be that sign from God that you should change your ways.

440
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:52,155
No, I think that's going to be something big.

441
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:55,558
Downstairs, mean while, Lindsay arrived at the bar for her date.

442
00:17:55,655 --> 00:17:56,578
Michael.

443
00:17:56,684 --> 00:17:58,002
Oh, my God, my husband!

444
00:17:58,102 --> 00:17:59,457
Oh, my God, my wife!

445
00:17:59,602 --> 00:18:00,872
Are you two here for each other?

446
00:18:00,992 --> 00:18:02,414
Is that what you're doing?

447
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,314
- How dare you?!
- How dare you?!

448
00:18:04,432 --> 00:18:06,016
- And with another woman! 
- And with another man!

449
00:18:06,121 --> 00:18:08,900
Wait, wait. You didn't plan this together?

450
00:18:09,022 --> 00:18:11,245
I just assumed you wanted a Holy Trinity.

451
00:18:11,339 --> 00:18:12,504
Absolutely not!

452
00:18:12,601 --> 00:18:13,887
We're a happily married couple.

453
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,947
Yes, who happen to be very much in love with each other.

454
00:18:17,111 --> 00:18:19,526
Well, you're still going to have to pay Frank.

455
00:18:20,758 --> 00:18:22,369
And Michael confronted his father.

456
00:18:22,482 --> 00:18:25,200
I know who N. Bluth is. It is Nellie.

457
00:18:25,339 --> 00:18:26,931
And I found her.

458
00:18:27,071 --> 00:18:29,626
That's your sissy cousin Larry.

459
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:32,162
Even then we knew. That's why we called him "Nellie."

460
00:18:32,284 --> 00:18:33,808
Do you not know that expression, Michael?

461
00:18:33,931 --> 00:18:35,046
I thought we were on the same page here.

462
00:18:35,152 --> 00:18:37,437
That's a nice try, Pop, but in your old computer, I found a Nellie.

463
00:18:37,518 --> 00:18:39,448
You're trying to tell me that is not my sister?

464
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,319
Yes. It's perfectly innocent.

465
00:18:41,415 --> 00:18:43,003
She's my prostitute.

466
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,871
I'm a red-blooded man. I have certain needs that your mom can't satisfy.

467
00:18:46,964 --> 00:18:48,702
But sex wasn't one of them.

468
00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:51,949
I just want my brother to envy my money,

469
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:54,590
but he's got that hair.

470
00:18:54,687 --> 00:18:59,079
Why can't I have hair and money and him nothing?

471
00:18:59,733 --> 00:19:00,789
She's not my sister.

472
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:02,075
I let her into the company.

473
00:19:02,185 --> 00:19:04,530
You didn't give her access to the cash, did you?

474
00:19:04,629 --> 00:19:05,709
She said she liked me.

475
00:19:05,816 --> 00:19:11,404
She's a prostitute! That's her job! Oh, no, the N. Bluth account.

476
00:19:11,499 --> 00:19:14,131
What? The N. Bluth account? That is your account?

477
00:19:14,231 --> 00:19:15,193
Maybe.

478
00:19:15,335 --> 00:19:19,123
But it's only embezzlement if you spend it outside the company.

479
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,449
It's gone. It's empty.

480
00:19:21,548 --> 00:19:22,460
She got to it.

481
00:19:22,548 --> 00:19:23,736
Well, there goes the company.

482
00:19:23,814 --> 00:19:24,812
Okay, now, hold on now.

483
00:19:24,905 --> 00:19:29,320
Let's not panic because I-I know someone who can find her.

484
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:30,486
His name is Frank.

485
00:19:30,578 --> 00:19:32,134
That's Gob's puppet.

486
00:19:32,584 --> 00:19:33,889
I'm going to prison.

487
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:37,818
You haven't heard from Oscar lately have you?

488
00:19:37,836 --> 00:19:39,066
- No. 
- Okay.

489
00:19:39,258 --> 00:19:41,833
And the next day, Michael returned to the office

490
00:19:41,917 --> 00:19:45,366
to tell the employees that Black Friday had indeed arrived.

491
00:19:45,443 --> 00:19:46,772
Hey, Ted, what's going on?

492
00:19:46,879 --> 00:19:50,344
Nellie got all of us our checks and these great new computers and have you been...?

493
00:19:50,425 --> 00:19:52,171
Excuse me. Nellie, you did this?

494
00:19:52,256 --> 00:19:54,087
I took it out of the N. Bluth account.

495
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,371
And if you spend it within the company, it gives the prosecutors nothing.

496
00:19:57,459 --> 00:20:00,268
Also, it was the only way to get myself the ten grand that you owed me.

497
00:20:00,354 --> 00:20:03,104
Ten grand? What did you do with these guys, exactly?

498
00:20:03,191 --> 00:20:04,581
They mostly just cried.

499
00:20:04,683 --> 00:20:06,858
You've got a real morale problem here.

500
00:20:07,045 --> 00:20:08,113
You cried?

501
00:20:08,894 --> 00:20:11,243
Listen, I thought that you were going to...

502
00:20:11,334 --> 00:20:12,963
- Steal it? 
- Yes!

503
00:20:13,052 --> 00:20:15,221
But I might be your sister, remember?

504
00:20:15,316 --> 00:20:18,863
Well, the fact that you didn't steal it might actually be proof that you're not.

505
00:20:18,948 --> 00:20:22,216
Even if we're not related, I think I would like for you to work here.

506
00:20:22,309 --> 00:20:23,520
You're very, very good at it.

507
00:20:23,618 --> 00:20:27,899
And what you do for a job is not really a great way to make a living, you know?

508
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,827
I make 300 grand a year.

509
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,143
Marry me.

510
00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:33,761
It's weird on so many levels.

511
00:20:33,852 --> 00:20:35,982
On the next... Arrested Development

512
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,159
Gob has a religious conversion.

513
00:20:38,257 --> 00:20:39,457
I've seen a sign.

514
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:40,771
And I want to make this work.

515
00:20:40,867 --> 00:20:43,747
A committed relationship that actually means something.

516
00:20:47,665 --> 00:20:49,893
