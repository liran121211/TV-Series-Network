1
00:00:01,877 --> 00:00:03,420

Now the story of a wealthy

2
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:05,005

family who lost everything

3
00:00:05,047 --> 00:00:06,924

and the one son who had no

4
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,800

choice but to   
keep them all together.

5
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:16,516

It's Arrested Development.

6
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,687

Michael Bluth   
and his family were

7
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:22,355

meeting with   
their new attorney.

8
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,107

Look, this is not  
 the first time I've

9
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:26,026

been brought in to   
replace Barry Zuckerkorn.

10
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,028

I think I can do for  
 you everything he did.

11
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:29,571

Plus, skew younger.

12
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:31,114

With juries and so forth.

13
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:32,199

Any other questions?

14
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,159

Yes. How can   
you be even cuter in

15
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:36,036

person than you  
 are in your ads?

16
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:38,246

Are you a CEO, CFO or other

17
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,332

executive facing   
these or similar charges?

18
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,918

Why should you go to jail for

19
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:45,045

a crime someone else noticed?

20
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:47,797

You don't need double-talk.

21
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,507

You need Bob Loblaw.

22
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:51,676

Bob Loblaw,  no habla Espanol.

23
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,137
Well, we're not here to talk
nonsense to Bob Loblaw.
 

24
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,305

We need to find out if the

25
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:56,973

government has a   
good case against us.

26
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:58,558

There was a lot  
 of proof that my

27
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:00,143

father was   
building houses in Iraq.

28
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:01,561

Well, your   
father claims he was

29
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:03,146

put up to it by a  
 British syndicate.

30
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:05,064
And you've been threatened,
isn't that correct?
 

31
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:06,149

It was.

32
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:07,984

How would you   
like someone going

33
00:01:08,067 --> 00:01:09,819

after some stupid   
person in your family?

34
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,905

Now back off,   
you ( bleep ) ponce!

35
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:13,531

It's been a week.  
 Nothing's happened.

36
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,450

Yeah, but you're  
 not the one stuck

37
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,285

under house arrest  
 like a sitting duck.

38
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:18,703

Yeah, that's my father.

39
00:01:18,786 --> 00:01:20,038

That's why we had the meeting

40
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:21,664

here-- so that he  
 couldn't interfere.

41
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,833

Interfere? I   
ought to pull down

42
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:25,960

your pants and   
spank your ass raw.

43
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,211

I'm sorry. Have we met?

44
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:28,755

Oh, yes, this   
is Larry Mittleman.

45
00:01:28,796 --> 00:01:29,964

He's your father's surrogate.

46
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,049

Surrogate?

47
00:01:31,215 --> 00:01:33,176

That's right,   
you dumb ( bleep ).

48
00:01:33,217 --> 00:01:35,511
I hired this guy to wear  a
camera in his hat so he
 

49
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:36,721

could be my eyes and ears

50
00:01:36,804 --> 00:01:38,264

while I'm stuck   
in this penthouse.

51
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:41,309

This camera helps me   
keep tabs on you idiots,

52
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:43,853

while this thing  
 rubs my ankle raw.

53
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:46,105

I mean, look at this thing.

54
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:47,607

I can't even go  
 in the hallway...

55
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:48,608

- ...without hearing..

56
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:51,235

...that beep, beep, beep.

57
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,404

That's one of my   
partners. Excuse me.

58
00:01:53,487 --> 00:01:56,032

I would like to be   
one of your partners.

59
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:58,326

Do you think he got   
that-- the two meanings?

60
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,244

He's running pretty  
 fast. I think he did.

61
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:02,705

Well, he was flirting 
earlier, I'll tell you that.

62
00:02:02,788 --> 00:02:05,458

Just so you know... I'm  
 looking to get divorced.

63
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:07,335

- Are you interested?   
- Yes.

64
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:13,466

Let's call that a half hour.

65
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:16,010
So you're not the only  one
who's got a date later.
 

66
00:02:16,093 --> 00:02:17,094

You've got a date?

67
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:18,929

Her name's Rita. She  
 teaches children at a

68
00:02:18,929 --> 00:02:20,723

private school and   
we're just having lunch.

69
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:23,601

Oh, lunch? Well,   
better bring some dog food.

70
00:02:23,684 --> 00:02:25,686

'Cause all the girls   
you date are dogs, and...

71
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:27,730

Dogs love dog   
food, right, Pop?

72
00:02:27,813 --> 00:02:30,274
Shut up, you idiot. I'm
trying to watch the game.
 

73
00:02:30,357 --> 00:02:31,859

I was trying to   
make you laugh, Dad.

74
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,444

That's all I ever wanted.

75
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:35,946

You know, Gob,  
 she's not a dog.

76
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,448

It's the just   
opposite, actually.

77
00:02:37,531 --> 00:02:39,950

She's exquisitely   
beautiful. She's fun,

78
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:43,412

carefree, smart,  
 full of surprises.

79
00:02:43,495 --> 00:02:44,997

Including the fact that she

80
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,498

was working with this man--

81
00:02:46,582 --> 00:02:48,917

who was currently   
dropping her off for her date.

82
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:50,627

All this fun   
and carefree act is

83
00:02:50,711 --> 00:02:52,254

only going to   
fool him for so long.

84
00:02:52,337 --> 00:02:53,547

I'm a big girl.

85
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,508

Yeah. Well, if he   
finds out what you really are

86
00:02:56,592 --> 00:02:58,802

he might not make   
things so simple for you.

87
00:02:58,886 --> 00:03:02,347

Rita, don't forget your hat.

88
00:03:06,518 --> 00:03:07,603

I know, that might make you

89
00:03:07,686 --> 00:03:08,770

feel she's too good for me.

90
00:03:08,854 --> 00:03:09,855

How do you think I feel?

91
00:03:09,938 --> 00:03:11,857

Bob Loblaw's a handsome,

92
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,775

professional man   
and I'm only just a...

93
00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:15,444

well, none of those things.

94
00:03:15,527 --> 00:03:17,112

Okay, Lindsay,   
are you forgetting

95
00:03:17,195 --> 00:03:18,780

that I was a   
professional twice over--

96
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,490

an analyst and a therapist.

97
00:03:20,574 --> 00:03:22,784

The world's first analrapist.

98
00:03:22,868 --> 00:03:24,411

Yes, and you were almost

99
00:03:24,494 --> 00:03:25,954

arrested for   
those business cards.

100
00:03:25,996 --> 00:03:27,873

Yes. No, it did not   
look good on paper but I

101
00:03:27,956 --> 00:03:29,791

didn't stop because   
of the police inquiries,

102
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:32,377

I stopped to raise  
 our little daughter.

103
00:03:32,461 --> 00:03:34,379

But since we have both started

104
00:03:34,463 --> 00:03:36,256

to grow hair in   
unexpected places,

105
00:03:36,339 --> 00:03:38,967
I supposed I shall soon be
working as a leading man.
 

106
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:41,136

And she may soon start dating.

107
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:42,637

Maeby had   
already started dating.

108
00:03:42,637 --> 00:03:44,097

- All right, see  
 you tomorrow night

109
00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:46,016

Another date with Steve Holt?

110
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:48,351

Yeah. We're   
getting pretty serious.

111
00:03:48,435 --> 00:03:49,436

They weren't.

112
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,146

She was just avoiding her

113
00:03:51,229 --> 00:03:52,689

real crush on George Michael.

114
00:03:52,772 --> 00:03:54,691

That Steve sure   
knows how to please a lady.

115
00:03:54,774 --> 00:03:55,859

Good.

116
00:03:55,942 --> 00:03:58,445

I was helping he   
would be gifted sexually.

117
00:03:58,528 --> 00:04:00,405

I guess it   
makes sense, you know,

118
00:04:00,488 --> 00:04:02,282

older guys   
expect certain things.

119
00:04:02,365 --> 00:04:03,366

They do?

120
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,577

What a fun, sexy time for you.

121
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,495

I'd be very careful   
of these British people.

122
00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:09,330

They're going to try  
 to get their hands on

123
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,040

any evidence they   
can to hurt the family.

124
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,625

So you're saying   
shred the evidence?

125
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:14,002

No, that's illegal.

126
00:04:14,085 --> 00:04:16,129

The prosecution is   
entitled to that evidence.

127
00:04:16,212 --> 00:04:17,672

Without it, they  
 don't have a case.

128
00:04:17,714 --> 00:04:19,215

So you're saying   
shred the evidence?

129
00:04:19,257 --> 00:04:20,466

That's a felony.

130
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,635
And I certainly couldn't
endorse anything like that.
 

131
00:04:22,719 --> 00:04:23,887

Got ya.

132
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:24,971

Wink.

133
00:04:25,054 --> 00:04:26,055

Wink.

134
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:28,558

Did you say   
"wink" or did you wink?

135
00:04:28,641 --> 00:04:30,143

He said that, too, Dad.

136
00:04:30,226 --> 00:04:32,061

We'll talk soon,  
 folks. Thank you.

137
00:04:32,145 --> 00:04:34,605

Where you going? Where  
 is the surrogate going?

138
00:04:34,689 --> 00:04:35,690

Stay there.

139
00:04:35,773 --> 00:04:37,817

I want to see what he's 
going to say. Don't leave.

140
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,943

See you, pop.

141
00:04:39,027 --> 00:04:42,196
Gob, instead of trying to
impress your fake father,
 

142
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,365
maybe you should spend some
time with your real son.
 

143
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:45,783

Steve Holt's not my son.

144
00:04:45,867 --> 00:04:46,868

Steve Holt?

145
00:04:46,951 --> 00:04:48,286

With the moron jock?

146
00:04:48,369 --> 00:04:50,288

That's my son, you pothead.

147
00:04:50,371 --> 00:04:51,747

Hey, hey, hey, that's my son.

148
00:04:51,831 --> 00:04:54,125
Wait, so that means   that
Steve Holt is my cousin?
 

149
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:55,626

And Maeby's cousin, too.

150
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:56,711

I guess.

151
00:04:56,794 --> 00:04:58,296

Shoot, I'm late for my date.

152
00:04:58,379 --> 00:04:59,797

At the kennel.

153
00:04:59,881 --> 00:05:00,882

Right.

154
00:05:00,965 --> 00:05:02,300

Sorry. You lobbed that one

155
00:05:02,383 --> 00:05:03,593

right over the plate, Michael.

156
00:05:03,676 --> 00:05:04,677

Home run.

157
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,596

And Michael   
hurried to the British

158
00:05:06,679 --> 00:05:08,431

section Orange   
County for his date.

159
00:05:08,514 --> 00:05:10,516

...American!   
Get out of the road.

160
00:05:10,599 --> 00:05:13,352

Only to find that  
 Rita had chosen Wee

161
00:05:13,436 --> 00:05:16,105

Britain's one   
American-themed restaurant.

162
00:05:16,188 --> 00:05:17,815

Oh, hello. I'm sorry I'm late.

163
00:05:17,898 --> 00:05:19,400

Oh, no bother.

164
00:05:19,483 --> 00:05:21,819

I've been having such   
fun on this space shuttle.

165
00:05:21,902 --> 00:05:22,903

Strike one, huh?

166
00:05:22,987 --> 00:05:24,447

Shall we go   
ahead and sit down?

167
00:05:27,491 --> 00:05:31,287
Hey, dudes, I'll get you a
couple of 64-ounce colas
 

168
00:05:31,328 --> 00:05:33,330

to wash down this basket of

169
00:05:33,414 --> 00:05:35,332

doughnut and get   
your nachos started.

170
00:05:35,374 --> 00:05:37,459
I guess this is what the
British think of Americans.
 

171
00:05:37,543 --> 00:05:39,753

- They like our food.   
- Whatever do you mean?

172
00:05:41,255 --> 00:05:42,673

Yeah. Uh...

173
00:05:42,798 --> 00:05:43,924

You know, Rita, you're going

174
00:05:43,924 --> 00:05:45,134

to figure this out eventually,

175
00:05:45,217 --> 00:05:47,845
but I have not been on a date
in a long, long time.
 

176
00:05:47,928 --> 00:05:50,514

- Neither have I.   
- I wonder why?

177
00:05:50,806 --> 00:05:52,641

No, I bet men ask  
 you out constantly.

178
00:05:52,725 --> 00:05:54,059

Not men like you.

179
00:05:54,476 --> 00:05:56,353

I seem to only   
meet little boys.

180
00:05:56,395 --> 00:05:57,604

Part of that might be that you

181
00:05:57,688 --> 00:05:58,897

spend your day at a preschool.

182
00:05:58,981 --> 00:06:01,400

And they think the   
stupidest things are funny.

183
00:06:01,483 --> 00:06:03,610
Yeah, that's a cultural
problem, is what it is.
 

184
00:06:03,694 --> 00:06:05,404

You know, your   
average American male

185
00:06:05,487 --> 00:06:07,156

is in perpetual   
state of adolescence,

186
00:06:07,239 --> 00:06:08,574

you know.   
arrested development.

187
00:06:08,657 --> 00:06:10,450

Hey, that's the  
 name of the show.

188
00:06:10,534 --> 00:06:12,494

No attention span. You know,

189
00:06:12,578 --> 00:06:14,413

can't even carry   
on a typical conv...

190
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:16,665

Michael thought he spotted the

191
00:06:16,748 --> 00:06:18,333

man who'd   
threatened him earlier.

192
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,460

I'm getting back   
on the space shuttle.

193
00:06:20,544 --> 00:06:22,796

No, no, no. Sorry,  
 sorry. Sit, please.

194
00:06:22,921 --> 00:06:24,923

Let's talk about you.   
Tell me about your family.

195
00:06:24,923 --> 00:06:25,924

No.

196
00:06:26,717 --> 00:06:29,302

They're pushy,   
bossy, want to control me.

197
00:06:29,594 --> 00:06:30,971

What about your family?

198
00:06:31,847 --> 00:06:33,765

I'd love to meet your family.

199
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,934

Michael knew from experience

200
00:06:36,017 --> 00:06:37,936

that this would   
not turn out well.

201
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,734

If you like the small, why

202
00:06:44,818 --> 00:06:46,319

don't you come   
back for the medium?

203
00:06:52,367 --> 00:06:54,244

I probably should   
warn you about my mother...

204
00:06:54,244 --> 00:06:55,453

Hi.

205
00:06:57,372 --> 00:06:58,873

So he came up with a

206
00:06:58,957 --> 00:07:00,458

solution so   
simple, he'd wondered

207
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,211

why he'd never   
told anyone it before.

208
00:07:03,712 --> 00:07:05,338

I don't have a family.

209
00:07:06,256 --> 00:07:09,300
I can't believe I've never
told anybody that before.
 

210
00:07:09,676 --> 00:07:10,844

That's so sad.

211
00:07:10,885 --> 00:07:12,470

Yes,it's sad. Super sad.

212
00:07:12,554 --> 00:07:13,805

Shall we eat?

213
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,185

Michael had   
started a relationship by

214
00:07:19,269 --> 00:07:21,229

lying about the   
existence of his family.

215
00:07:21,312 --> 00:07:22,814

I think this   
went really well, huh?

216
00:07:22,897 --> 00:07:24,357

Maybe sometime   
we can have dinner?

217
00:07:24,607 --> 00:07:26,067

Could I see your house?

218
00:07:26,192 --> 00:07:28,987

Michael was caught   
off guard by the question.

219
00:07:29,988 --> 00:07:32,991

No, no, I-I can't do that.

220
00:07:33,116 --> 00:07:34,117

Okay, bye-bye.

221
00:07:34,492 --> 00:07:35,618

Uh... bye.

222
00:07:36,452 --> 00:07:38,997

And he vowed not to be  
 caught off guard again.

223
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:40,248

I didn't mean that...

224
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:43,251

So did he   
invite you over, then?

225
00:07:43,334 --> 00:07:44,752

Not yet, but he will.

226
00:07:46,254 --> 00:07:48,589

So Michael went back to work.

227
00:07:49,298 --> 00:07:50,883

Hey, who   
brought in the wood...?

228
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,472

Gob, you can't shred this

229
00:07:56,556 --> 00:07:58,266

evidence.   
You'll end up in jail.

230
00:07:58,307 --> 00:07:59,475

Dad told me to.

231
00:07:59,517 --> 00:08:01,269

How can I say no to that face?

232
00:08:01,394 --> 00:08:03,271

Get this stuff   
out of here, and put

233
00:08:03,354 --> 00:08:05,106

it somewhere where  
 Dad can't get to it.

234
00:08:05,273 --> 00:08:06,524

Are you in on this, too?

235
00:08:06,524 --> 00:08:07,775

No, I'm just here to go out

236
00:08:07,858 --> 00:08:08,985

to lunch with your father.

237
00:08:10,444 --> 00:08:13,072
The man said he's never felt
more free in his life.
 

238
00:08:13,155 --> 00:08:14,949

I'm like a bird up there...

239
00:08:14,991 --> 00:08:17,576

Ah, did you tell   
him about my medal?

240
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,203

Medal? What for?

241
00:08:19,286 --> 00:08:21,122

Oh, who knows   
what they were saying?

242
00:08:21,205 --> 00:08:22,998
...private citizenship and
hereby reenlist in
 

243
00:08:23,082 --> 00:08:25,126
the armed services of the
United States of America?
 

244
00:08:25,209 --> 00:08:27,211

If you agree with   
this, say thank you."

245
00:08:27,294 --> 00:08:29,130

Thank you. Wow.

246
00:08:29,213 --> 00:08:30,714

I have so many  
 people to thank.

247
00:08:30,798 --> 00:08:32,174

- Private   
Ashford, step forward

248
00:08:32,258 --> 00:08:34,760

It's probably because   
a seal bit off his hand.

249
00:08:34,844 --> 00:08:37,847
The army has taken to giving
medals for being food.
 

250
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:38,931

Just then...

251
00:08:40,891 --> 00:08:42,768

It's so simple.

252
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,271

My ankle monitor only goes

253
00:08:45,354 --> 00:08:46,981

off when go   
out the front door.

254
00:08:47,064 --> 00:08:48,274

We need balloons.

255
00:08:48,357 --> 00:08:49,358

A party.

256
00:08:49,441 --> 00:08:50,901

We need to throw a party...

257
00:08:50,985 --> 00:08:52,319

for Buster's stupid thing.

258
00:08:52,403 --> 00:08:54,363

Larry, go get some balloons.

259
00:08:54,446 --> 00:08:56,031

And Michael found a way to

260
00:08:56,115 --> 00:08:57,616

get Rita to his  
 house after all.

261
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,369
That's a great idea.   Honor
Buster tomorrow night.
 

262
00:09:00,452 --> 00:09:02,037

We'll get the   
whole family over to

263
00:09:02,121 --> 00:09:03,664

the penthouse,   
show him our support.

264
00:09:03,747 --> 00:09:05,916

Well, I suppose it's   
better than drinking alone.

265
00:09:05,999 --> 00:09:07,000

What time?

266
00:09:07,084 --> 00:09:08,460

It doesn't   
matter to me. I can't

267
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,962

be there. I've   
got a date with Rita.

268
00:09:11,296 --> 00:09:12,673

Well, Mom's probably right. I

269
00:09:12,756 --> 00:09:14,174

couldn't even   
stand up to a seal.

270
00:09:14,258 --> 00:09:16,093

I don't real   
deserve a medal or a party.

271
00:09:16,176 --> 00:09:17,678

No, you deserve this.

272
00:09:17,678 --> 00:09:19,846

Here, take my business card.

273
00:09:20,222 --> 00:09:22,474

No, no, it's   
pronounced a-nal-ra-pist.

274
00:09:22,516 --> 00:09:23,517

It wasn't really the

275
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,935

pronunciation   
that bothered me.

276
00:09:24,935 --> 00:09:26,478

You see, Buster, it wasn't the

277
00:09:26,561 --> 00:09:28,105

seal that you   
couldn't stand up to.

278
00:09:28,188 --> 00:09:30,357

It was... Lucille.

279
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:33,276

Oh, I'm getting chills.

280
00:09:33,402 --> 00:09:35,529

If this was a   
Lifetime Moment of

281
00:09:35,612 --> 00:09:37,614

Truth movie, this   
would be our act break.

282
00:09:39,908 --> 00:09:41,118

But it wasn't.

283
00:09:41,284 --> 00:09:44,579
And later Lindsay was on the
phone with Bob Loblaw.
 

284
00:09:44,621 --> 00:09:46,248

The thing about Tobias-- that

285
00:09:46,331 --> 00:09:47,874

he's never   
fulfilled me sexually.

286
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,668

Can you catalog   
for me the various

287
00:09:49,751 --> 00:09:51,461

ways you've been   
promised to be fulfilled

288
00:09:51,461 --> 00:09:53,755

whether or not said   
promise was made explicit?

289
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,507

You want me to be explicit?

290
00:09:55,632 --> 00:09:57,217

Yes, but I will be needing

291
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,718

to get off in four minutes.

292
00:09:58,802 --> 00:10:02,472
Well, let's see if I can't
hit that target for you.
 

293
00:10:02,555 --> 00:10:04,808

The next day on the  
 way to pick up Rita,

294
00:10:04,891 --> 00:10:07,185

Michael stopped   
by his house to make

295
00:10:07,268 --> 00:10:09,521

sure there were no   
signs of his family...

296
00:10:09,646 --> 00:10:12,273

only to discover   
there was nothing but.

297
00:10:12,357 --> 00:10:13,733

What the hell is all this?

298
00:10:13,858 --> 00:10:15,318

Oh, Gob brought   
all this stuff in.

299
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,946

And, Mom, what is   
with all the family photos?

300
00:10:18,029 --> 00:10:20,949

Oh, I'm teaching Buster  
 to stand up for himself.

301
00:10:21,032 --> 00:10:22,492

I'm surrogating your mother.

302
00:10:22,575 --> 00:10:23,993

By wearing her sealskin coat?

303
00:10:24,077 --> 00:10:25,703

Michael, I have tried on

304
00:10:25,787 --> 00:10:27,497

everything, and   
nothing seems be working.

305
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:28,957

I thought the   
Donna Karan worked;

306
00:10:28,998 --> 00:10:30,542

you just didn't   
have the right shoes.

307
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:31,960

Look, I've got   
to get rid of any

308
00:10:32,001 --> 00:10:33,461

evidence of my   
family and quickly--

309
00:10:33,545 --> 00:10:35,088

including you guys.

310
00:10:35,171 --> 00:10:36,381

Get out of here.

311
00:10:36,464 --> 00:10:38,758

See, now that's how   
you stand up to Mother.

312
00:10:38,841 --> 00:10:40,677

Meanwhile, worried about

313
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,553

Steve Holt's   
sexual expectations,

314
00:10:42,637 --> 00:10:44,222

Maeby tried to  
 cancel her date.

315
00:10:44,305 --> 00:10:45,348

My whole family and I now

316
00:10:45,431 --> 00:10:46,849

have to go to   
my grandma's house,

317
00:10:46,891 --> 00:10:48,685

'cause my uncle lost his hand.

318
00:10:48,768 --> 00:10:51,729
Awesome! So you and I can
party alone at your house.
 

319
00:10:51,813 --> 00:10:54,232

Maeby was too   
young to know what to do.

320
00:10:54,315 --> 00:10:56,401

Ironically, in  
 her after-school

321
00:10:56,484 --> 00:10:58,444

job as a movie   
studio executive,

322
00:10:58,528 --> 00:11:00,530

she'd just green-lit two films

323
00:11:00,613 --> 00:11:02,573

that dealt   
with the very issue.

324
00:11:02,657 --> 00:11:03,866

Rock the house.

325
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:04,951

All right.

326
00:11:05,034 --> 00:11:07,453

George Michael also   
didn't know what to do.

327
00:11:07,537 --> 00:11:09,163

If he pointed out that the two

328
00:11:09,247 --> 00:11:10,748

were cousins to  
 drive them apart,

329
00:11:10,831 --> 00:11:12,458

he might be burning the very

330
00:11:12,542 --> 00:11:14,126

bridge that he one  
 day hoped to cross.

331
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,920

Michael. I'm doing  
 your cousin tonight.

332
00:11:16,003 --> 00:11:17,046

So are you.

333
00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:18,130

What?

334
00:11:18,214 --> 00:11:19,674

She's your cousin, too.

335
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:21,384

Back at the penthouse, party

336
00:11:21,467 --> 00:11:23,010

preparations were underway.

337
00:11:23,052 --> 00:11:24,553

He's not wearing that to the

338
00:11:24,637 --> 00:11:26,138

party. I've go   
the exact same thing.

339
00:11:26,222 --> 00:11:28,099

No, he was just analraping me.

340
00:11:28,182 --> 00:11:29,725

Then Michael   
barged in, and kicked us

341
00:11:29,809 --> 00:11:31,435

out so he could   
shred all the evidence.

342
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,145

Shred the evidence?

343
00:11:33,229 --> 00:11:34,772

Thought he didn't  
 want us to do that.

344
00:11:34,855 --> 00:11:36,482

He didn't want us   
to get into trouble.

345
00:11:36,565 --> 00:11:38,192

He's taking the heat.

346
00:11:38,275 --> 00:11:39,985

He's doing that for us?

347
00:11:40,069 --> 00:11:42,029

And on the night   
of his date with Rita.

348
00:11:42,112 --> 00:11:44,073

Who he didn't want  
 to bring over here.

349
00:11:44,156 --> 00:11:45,991

Probably because,  
 let's face it, you

350
00:11:46,075 --> 00:11:47,868

people haven't been   
great with the others.

351
00:11:47,952 --> 00:11:49,411

Well, in our defense, Mom,

352
00:11:49,495 --> 00:11:50,871

we're not exactly dog people.

353
00:11:50,955 --> 00:11:52,706

We have got to   
start being nicer.

354
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,041

I'm starting right now.

355
00:11:54,124 --> 00:11:56,460

Buster, the party's  
 not for you anymore.

356
00:11:56,794 --> 00:11:59,129

It's a "Welcome Rita" party.

357
00:11:59,254 --> 00:12:00,464

I know where she works. We can

358
00:12:00,547 --> 00:12:01,715

pick her up and surprise her.

359
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:03,092

You're so right.

360
00:12:03,175 --> 00:12:05,594

This is better   
than a party for me.

361
00:12:05,677 --> 00:12:07,888

Come on. Grow a pair.

362
00:12:09,848 --> 00:12:12,392

You know, we need   
some weather balloons

363
00:12:12,476 --> 00:12:15,020

for this party and   
maybe a tank of hydrogen.

364
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,855

You know, really   
float those suckers.

365
00:12:16,939 --> 00:12:18,649

Meanwhile, Michael was hiding

366
00:12:18,732 --> 00:12:20,400

the evidence wherever he could

367
00:12:20,442 --> 00:12:21,902

when he heard   
from his brother.

368
00:12:21,985 --> 00:12:23,779

Hey, friend. Gob here. We

369
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,531

really want you at the party.

370
00:12:25,572 --> 00:12:29,618

We're really nice   
now, and God, we love you.

371
00:12:30,077 --> 00:12:31,828

Oh, damn it.

372
00:12:31,912 --> 00:12:34,081

And the family   
picked up Rita in the

373
00:12:34,164 --> 00:12:36,208

only vehicle big   
enough to hold them all.

374
00:12:36,249 --> 00:12:37,584

Hey, excuse me, Rita.

375
00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:38,710

I'm Rita.

376
00:12:38,835 --> 00:12:40,837

We're here to pick  
 you up for Michael.

377
00:12:40,921 --> 00:12:42,798

You can just go in the cabin.

378
00:12:47,469 --> 00:12:48,470

Michael?

379
00:12:48,595 --> 00:12:50,931

Oh, he's not here.

380
00:12:51,014 --> 00:12:52,307

We're his family.

381
00:12:52,474 --> 00:12:54,184

His family?

382
00:12:54,267 --> 00:12:55,560

We're nice.

383
00:12:56,019 --> 00:12:57,521

I'm sorry. I have to leave.

384
00:12:57,604 --> 00:13:00,273

Oh, no, you can't   
leave. Drive, Lindsay.

385
00:13:00,357 --> 00:13:01,733

Bye!

386
00:13:01,775 --> 00:13:03,276

We're doing this for Michael.

387
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,361

Stop her, Buster.

388
00:13:04,361 --> 00:13:05,362

What am I supposed to do?

389
00:13:05,403 --> 00:13:07,072

- Stop her!   
- Stop yelling at me!

390
00:13:07,155 --> 00:13:08,156

I'm leaving!

391
00:13:08,239 --> 00:13:09,866

And that's when Buster

392
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:11,493

noticed the seal   
on Rita's backpack.

393
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,293

Hey, talk about cathartic.

394
00:13:20,377 --> 00:13:22,087

Now that's an act break.

395
00:13:26,633 --> 00:13:29,385

Buster had   
overcome his fear of seals.

396
00:13:29,385 --> 00:13:31,221

Unfortunately, he'd done so by

397
00:13:31,262 --> 00:13:33,056

knocking out   
Michael's new girlfriend.

398
00:13:33,056 --> 00:13:34,599

What the hell did you do?

399
00:13:34,682 --> 00:13:35,683

You curious, Mom?

400
00:13:35,725 --> 00:13:37,227

I can show you.

401
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:38,478

You made a mistake.

402
00:13:38,603 --> 00:13:39,646

You're human...

403
00:13:39,812 --> 00:13:40,897

except for the hand.

404
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,315

It's okay, she's alive.

405
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,692

And soft. Soft and alive.

406
00:13:44,734 --> 00:13:47,403

All right, let's not   
add that to the charges.

407
00:13:47,403 --> 00:13:49,530

What do we do? She's  
 going to tell Michael.

408
00:13:49,697 --> 00:13:51,199

And he won't   
hear the good stuff.

409
00:13:51,282 --> 00:13:52,742

He'll just hear   
about the beating.

410
00:13:52,742 --> 00:13:54,911

Wait! Maybe we can   
give her a Forget-Me-Now.

411
00:13:54,952 --> 00:13:57,955

Here you go, hot   
dog. Take the pill.

412
00:13:57,955 --> 00:13:58,998

What's a Forget-Me-Now?

413
00:13:59,082 --> 00:14:00,249

They're pills that create a

414
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:01,751

sort of   
temporary forgettingness.

415
00:14:01,751 --> 00:14:03,294

So if somebody   
finds out how you do a

416
00:14:03,294 --> 00:14:04,879

trick, you just   
give 'em one of these,

417
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:06,255

and they forget  
 the whole thing.

418
00:14:06,255 --> 00:14:08,257

It's a mainstay of   
the magician's toolkit,

419
00:14:08,341 --> 00:14:10,384
like how clowns always  have
a rag soaked in ether.
 

420
00:14:10,468 --> 00:14:12,512

Gob, this is Flunitrazepam.

421
00:14:12,595 --> 00:14:13,846

It's a roofie.

422
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:15,473

Those are illegal.

423
00:14:15,556 --> 00:14:16,557

Shut up, Mom.

424
00:14:16,641 --> 00:14:18,559

Don't make me give   
you another one of these.

425
00:14:20,102 --> 00:14:22,146

Lindsay, help me! Three!

426
00:14:25,733 --> 00:14:28,069

Back at the house,  
 Michael finished his

427
00:14:28,152 --> 00:14:30,404

work and now late,   
rushed to pick up Rita.

428
00:14:30,446 --> 00:14:32,406

Moments later,   
Maeby prepared to

429
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,367

tell Steve she   
wasn't ready for romance.

430
00:14:34,408 --> 00:14:36,577

Well, this   
sends a mixed message.

431
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,412

Just as Steve showed up to

432
00:14:38,496 --> 00:14:40,206

call things off  
 with his cousin.

433
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:41,749

You did all this for me?

434
00:14:41,874 --> 00:14:44,001

Yes, well...

435
00:14:44,126 --> 00:14:46,295

I'm going to go get sexy.

436
00:14:49,381 --> 00:14:51,383

And Michael missed Rita.

437
00:14:53,636 --> 00:14:54,637

Damn it.

438
00:14:54,803 --> 00:14:56,138

Strike two.

439
00:14:57,181 --> 00:14:58,182

Take it down.

440
00:14:58,265 --> 00:14:59,516

We don't want anything in

441
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,851

this house that says "Rita."

442
00:15:00,935 --> 00:15:04,104

Hi, it's   
Michael. I will be coming

443
00:15:04,188 --> 00:15:07,274

to the party   
because I love you, too.

444
00:15:07,358 --> 00:15:09,610

Okay, we need a new banner.

445
00:15:09,902 --> 00:15:12,404

And that's when   
Michael found Rita.

446
00:15:12,446 --> 00:15:13,572

Rita...

447
00:15:14,239 --> 00:15:16,283

Why am I on a   
bus bench, Michael?

448
00:15:16,366 --> 00:15:17,576

I get it... because I'm late.

449
00:15:17,618 --> 00:15:19,369

I'm sorry, but the  
 rest of the night's

450
00:15:19,453 --> 00:15:21,163

going to be all   
about you, I promise.

451
00:15:21,288 --> 00:15:22,623

Great, great.

452
00:15:22,706 --> 00:15:24,208

I am going to   
have to make one quick

453
00:15:24,249 --> 00:15:25,959

stop. Maybe you can  
 just wait in the car.

454
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:28,295

It's just going to be  
 two seconds, I promise.

455
00:15:28,378 --> 00:15:30,047

And so Michael raced up to

456
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,673

pay his quick   
respect to Buster.

457
00:15:31,757 --> 00:15:33,759

Ah, there he   
is, my favorite son.

458
00:15:33,842 --> 00:15:37,095

- Everybody's favorite son!   
- Mr. Wonderful!

459
00:15:37,179 --> 00:15:38,680

I had a great time. I wish

460
00:15:38,764 --> 00:15:40,182

I could have stayed longer.

461
00:15:40,265 --> 00:15:41,600

It was a great party, huh?

462
00:15:41,683 --> 00:15:43,101

Tell Buster I stopped by,

463
00:15:43,185 --> 00:15:44,644

please. I do   
have to leave, though.

464
00:15:44,686 --> 00:15:47,606

Oh, no, no. The party   
is not for Buster anymore.

465
00:15:47,689 --> 00:15:49,816

No, Michael, it's for you.

466
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,985

Take a look at  
 banner, Michael!

467
00:15:52,861 --> 00:15:55,530

You guys did   
all of this for me?

468
00:15:55,614 --> 00:15:57,949

- "Family love..."   
- Michael?

469
00:15:58,033 --> 00:15:59,743

Everyone froze.

470
00:15:59,868 --> 00:16:01,536

Michael feared he'd been

471
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,121

caught in a lie  
 about his family.

472
00:16:03,163 --> 00:16:06,166

His family feared   
they'd been caught by a

473
00:16:06,249 --> 00:16:09,127

woman they clubbed,   
drugged and left on a bench.

474
00:16:09,794 --> 00:16:11,171

It was awkward.

475
00:16:11,338 --> 00:16:12,839

Who's this?

476
00:16:12,964 --> 00:16:15,842

Mother! Mother!   
This is from army.

477
00:16:15,884 --> 00:16:17,636

I have to report  
 for duty tomorrow.

478
00:16:17,719 --> 00:16:20,138
It says by accepting this
medal, I was reenlisting.
 

479
00:16:20,138 --> 00:16:21,598

I didn't hear them say that.

480
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:23,058

Perhaps if the sergeant had

481
00:16:23,099 --> 00:16:24,559

spoken more   
slowly she would have.

482
00:16:24,642 --> 00:16:26,311

In acceptance of   
this medal, you proudly

483
00:16:26,394 --> 00:16:28,021

waive all rights   
to private citizenship

484
00:16:28,104 --> 00:16:29,647

and hereby   
reenlist in the armed

485
00:16:29,731 --> 00:16:31,441

services of the   
Unites States of America.

486
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:33,026

If you agree with  
 is, say thank you.

487
00:16:33,109 --> 00:16:36,529

Than-nk... you.

488
00:16:36,613 --> 00:16:38,490

What am I going to   
do? I can't go back there.

489
00:16:38,573 --> 00:16:39,824

I've never been.

490
00:16:39,908 --> 00:16:41,576

Who are these people?

491
00:16:41,659 --> 00:16:43,077

This is my family.

492
00:16:43,161 --> 00:16:45,705

No. No, I don't   
like these people.

493
00:16:45,788 --> 00:16:47,874

Me, you mean. She means me,

494
00:16:47,957 --> 00:16:50,001

because I lied   
about having a family

495
00:16:50,084 --> 00:16:52,962

because I was   
embarrassed by them.

496
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:55,089

And I'm ashamed of that.

497
00:16:55,173 --> 00:16:56,674

I have to leave.

498
00:16:58,343 --> 00:16:59,802

Strike three.

499
00:16:59,844 --> 00:17:03,097

You said you   
didn't have a family?

500
00:17:03,306 --> 00:17:06,726

- Everody's favorite son.   
- Mr. Terrible.

501
00:17:07,935 --> 00:17:10,521

And her, too good for us? Huh!

502
00:17:10,605 --> 00:17:12,773

Buster, you should   
have finished the job.

503
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,150

Job? What job?

504
00:17:14,192 --> 00:17:16,444

Did I say job? I meant Gob.

505
00:17:16,944 --> 00:17:18,196

Buster's the one that hit

506
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:19,655

her! I just   
gave her the roofie.

507
00:17:19,697 --> 00:17:20,698

Roofie?

508
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,741

Forget-Me-Now.

509
00:17:21,824 --> 00:17:24,327

You beat and drugged Rita?

510
00:17:26,203 --> 00:17:27,705

Take this and love us again.

511
00:17:27,705 --> 00:17:29,749

- No, Just take it!   
- No, no! No, no, Gob!

512
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,710

Um, I'm leaving, too.

513
00:17:34,462 --> 00:17:38,591

Well, no good   
deed goes unpunished.

514
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:41,427

Oh, look, it's   
not all bad. I-I got

515
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:44,221

Buster feeling   
better about his medal.

516
00:17:44,305 --> 00:17:45,473

Not anymore.

517
00:17:45,473 --> 00:17:47,183

I'm getting rid of this thing.

518
00:17:47,308 --> 00:17:50,811
It has caused me nothing but
pride and self-respect!
 

519
00:17:50,853 --> 00:17:52,646

Buster went to get rid of the

520
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:54,398

medal he finally  
 felt he deserved,

521
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,066

but it was exactly when

522
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:57,776

George Sr. was   
making his escape.

523
00:17:57,818 --> 00:17:59,737

Farewell to you all!

524
00:18:02,156 --> 00:18:04,283

But it turns out that hydrogen

525
00:18:04,366 --> 00:18:06,410

is more explosive than helium.

526
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,047

And George   
Michael came home to

527
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,673

find an   
unconscious Steve Holt.

528
00:18:19,715 --> 00:18:20,924

What have you guys been doing?

529
00:18:21,008 --> 00:18:22,259

I gave him a roofie.

530
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:24,678

A girl's got to  
 grow up sometime.

531
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,888

He's your cousin.

532
00:18:26,555 --> 00:18:27,556

My cousin?

533
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:29,600

I should have told  
 you that. Now you've

534
00:18:29,683 --> 00:18:31,602

drugged him and   
had your way with him.

535
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:33,729

How is that even possible?

536
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:35,606

No, George Michael,   
we didn't do anything.

537
00:18:35,689 --> 00:18:37,232

I just wanted   
him to think we did.

538
00:18:37,274 --> 00:18:38,817

Don't you see? I drugged him

539
00:18:38,901 --> 00:18:40,360

not to go all   
the way with him.

540
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:42,321

Well, I think   
even the anti-drug

541
00:18:42,404 --> 00:18:43,989

people are going   
to be okay with that.

542
00:18:44,406 --> 00:18:47,075

Well, let's get   
his pants back on.

543
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:48,243

You took his pants off?

544
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,787

And Michael   
tried to salvage the

545
00:18:50,871 --> 00:18:52,914

remains of the   
files from the car fire.

546
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:54,833

- You call the attorney?   
- Yeah, I sure did,

547
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,668

but he's not   
taking our calls because

548
00:18:56,752 --> 00:18:58,462

apparently the   
retainer all used up.

549
00:18:58,545 --> 00:19:00,672

He took my   
call. He's very good.

550
00:19:00,756 --> 00:19:02,757
Yeah, that's how the
retainer got eaten up, okay?
 

551
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,050

The secretary took it all

552
00:19:04,134 --> 00:19:05,343

down here on the transcript.

553
00:19:06,094 --> 00:19:07,220

She's very good, too.

554
00:19:07,304 --> 00:19:08,305

I'm not paying for this.

555
00:19:08,388 --> 00:19:09,556

Well, what am supposed to do?

556
00:19:09,639 --> 00:19:10,682

I don't know, Lindsay.

557
00:19:10,765 --> 00:19:12,267

The thing you   
say on page seven

558
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,019

looks like it could  
 be worth some money.

559
00:19:17,647 --> 00:19:18,815

Speaking to me yet?

560
00:19:18,898 --> 00:19:20,150

It's only been an hour.

561
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,485

You know, here, here's  
 what I don't understand.

562
00:19:22,569 --> 00:19:23,570

What were you guys doing

563
00:19:23,653 --> 00:19:24,821

with Rita in the first place?

564
00:19:24,904 --> 00:19:26,072

We just wanted to do

565
00:19:26,156 --> 00:19:27,532

something nice   
for you, Michael,

566
00:19:27,532 --> 00:19:29,576

because you do so much for us.

567
00:19:29,659 --> 00:19:30,994

I guess we screwed it up.

568
00:19:31,077 --> 00:19:32,954

Well I screwed it up because

569
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:34,831

I was trying to impress her

570
00:19:34,914 --> 00:19:37,292

and let's face it, she's 
probably too good for me.

571
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,085

No. What you   
need to do is go to

572
00:19:39,169 --> 00:19:40,753

her and ask   
for another chance.

573
00:19:40,837 --> 00:19:42,839

She'd be lucky to  
 have you, Michael.

574
00:19:45,258 --> 00:19:46,342

Thanks, Gob.

575
00:19:46,801 --> 00:19:48,595

Sometimes you do surprise me.

576
00:19:48,636 --> 00:19:50,805

I've got one   
more surprise for you.

577
00:19:53,182 --> 00:19:55,268

It ain't easy being whi...

578
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:57,770

And Michael did try  
 again with Rita, but

579
00:19:57,854 --> 00:20:00,231

this time,   
determined to keep no secrets.

580
00:20:00,315 --> 00:20:02,233

I want to tell you everything

581
00:20:02,317 --> 00:20:04,110

if, if you're   
willing to listen.

582
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,612

I'm a very good listener.

583
00:20:07,447 --> 00:20:08,448

Great.

584
00:20:09,157 --> 00:20:11,242

I'll start with the  
 misdemeanors and then

585
00:20:11,325 --> 00:20:12,577

we're going to push right on

586
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,036

through to the   
lighter treasons.

587
00:20:14,036 --> 00:20:17,123

So, 1983, uh...

588
00:20:24,172 --> 00:20:27,717
Lindsay tries to work off her
debt with Bob Loblaw.
 

589
00:20:27,758 --> 00:20:29,510

I'm willing to debase myself.

590
00:20:29,594 --> 00:20:31,053

Get a maid's uniform and

591
00:20:31,137 --> 00:20:32,430

come by my house around 7:00.

592
00:20:32,972 --> 00:20:34,557

There is no way   
to misterpret that.

593
00:20:34,682 --> 00:20:36,058

Except the one.

594
00:20:40,229 --> 00:20:43,566

And a traumatized   
Steve Holt needs a father.

595
00:20:43,649 --> 00:20:45,526

I've made a huge mistake.

596
00:20:49,238 --> 00:20:50,448

I know the feeling.

597
00:20:51,157 --> 00:20:52,366

I had you.

598
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,661

I'm your father, Steve Holt!

599
00:20:55,744 --> 00:20:57,329

I can't hide from it anymore.

600
00:20:58,372 --> 00:21:01,167

I won't forget this... Dad.

601
00:21:08,674 --> 00:21:09,675

I will.

602
00:21:14,763 --> 00:21:15,764

I will.
