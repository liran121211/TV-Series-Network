1
00:00:01,086 --> 00:00:04,351
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:04,456 --> 00:00:06,447
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:06,558 --> 00:00:08,549
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:14,132 --> 00:00:15,793
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

5
00:00:18,704 --> 00:00:20,899
<i>Michael Bluth arrived at work...</i>

6
00:00:21,006 --> 00:00:23,975
<i>to find his brother adjusting
to his newjob as president.</i>

7
00:00:24,076 --> 00:00:27,136
What have you got there?
"Don't be afraid to make a mi-"

8
00:00:29,381 --> 00:00:31,508
I'm not gonna
beat myself up over that.

9
00:00:31,616 --> 00:00:35,313
Oh. It works. So, I wrote your "Message from
the President" on the shareholders' statement.

10
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,320
Starla's making copies.

11
00:00:37,422 --> 00:00:39,720
Did I tell you that she'd make
a great secretary?

12
00:00:39,825 --> 00:00:41,986
Yeah. I'm not so sure that
hiring her wasn't a mistake.

13
00:00:42,094 --> 00:00:46,394
And I'm not afraid to make mistakes.
Or have you forgotten this little- Damn it!

14
00:00:46,498 --> 00:00:49,626
- My legs are so powerful.
- So I thought you might want to read it...

15
00:00:49,735 --> 00:00:51,635
seeing as how you are
the president now...

16
00:00:51,737 --> 00:00:55,400
- even though it's just a title.
- Uh, right. Yes, well...

17
00:00:55,507 --> 00:00:57,975
we should "circumvrent"
union penalties.

18
00:00:58,076 --> 00:01:00,943
- "Circumverate."
- Circumvent. Circumvent. Means to go around.

19
00:01:01,046 --> 00:01:02,775
The old reach around.

20
00:01:02,881 --> 00:01:05,145
Trust me. This makes you
look like a leader. Okay?

21
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,912
I don't think that
I need any help with that.

22
00:01:09,354 --> 00:01:12,187
it.
Just leave it where it is.

23
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:15,259
- Now, if you just flip-
- Here are the copies.

24
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,523
Hey. These are-
These are very small.

25
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,121
When you said you wanted
photocopies...

26
00:01:21,233 --> 00:01:24,168
I thought that you meant you
wanted them on a photo printer.

27
00:01:24,269 --> 00:01:27,466
Tell you what. From now on,
we're gonna use just the big printer.

28
00:01:27,572 --> 00:01:30,166
Okay. You're a perfectionist.

29
00:01:30,275 --> 00:01:32,175
Flashes of Quincy.

30
00:01:32,277 --> 00:01:36,373
<i>Starla claimed to have had
a relationship with music legend QuincyJones.</i>

31
00:01:36,481 --> 00:01:39,609
Mr. President, I'm gonna go look into
some LEGOLAND tickets for the weekend.

32
00:01:39,718 --> 00:01:43,518
- Cool. Let's do it.
- Actually, I just meant me and my son.

33
00:01:43,622 --> 00:01:45,351
Isn't he a little old
for that?

34
00:01:45,457 --> 00:01:48,119
No. Sorry.
I've been looking...

35
00:01:48,226 --> 00:01:51,889
to get some alone time with him,
and it just hasn't seemed to work out lately.

36
00:01:51,997 --> 00:01:54,158
No problem. I'll just call up
some of my friends.

37
00:01:55,734 --> 00:01:58,862
- What?
- What friends?

38
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:02,133
I've got friends, Michael.
I just don't talk to them because...

39
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,004
I work all the time.

40
00:02:09,481 --> 00:02:13,008
I think the plant lady's
wearing a thong.

41
00:02:13,118 --> 00:02:15,609
<i>Michael, this is
your office now?</i>

42
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,620
Yeah. Well, it's temporary.

43
00:02:17,722 --> 00:02:19,690
We gotta make sure Gob
looks like he's in charge.

44
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:23,488
Oh. Please. Allow me.
I'll just "circumvrent" you.

45
00:02:23,595 --> 00:02:26,086
<i>Let's make sure we don't
give him any real power.</i>

46
00:02:26,198 --> 00:02:30,692
- Mmm.
- So, I gotta a call today from
Gene Parmesan, our private eye.

47
00:02:30,802 --> 00:02:33,737
- He said he found something big.
- We have a private eye, huh?

48
00:02:33,839 --> 00:02:37,400
Oh, I hired him a hundred years ago to find out
if your father was cheating on me.

49
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:41,240
- He never did find anything.
- Well, he can't be very good then.

50
00:02:41,346 --> 00:02:43,906
- What did he find?
- He said he wanted to tell us in person.

51
00:02:44,015 --> 00:02:46,506
Don't get up. I just a-find-a the supplies...

52
00:02:46,618 --> 00:02:49,052
because I'm a-
Private detective.

53
00:02:49,154 --> 00:02:51,520
Gene Parmesan.
How are you doing?

54
00:02:51,623 --> 00:02:53,887
Gene! Oh, Gene!

55
00:02:53,992 --> 00:02:56,859
<i>- Isn't he the best?
- Gene was far from the best.</i>

56
00:02:56,962 --> 00:02:58,862
<i>- Very impressive.
- Thank you.</i>

57
00:02:58,964 --> 00:03:01,262
- What did you find?
- Oh, nothing.

58
00:03:01,366 --> 00:03:04,199
- Just your father's getaway car.
- You're kidding.

59
00:03:04,302 --> 00:03:08,466
<i>Michael's father had used
the family stairway vehicle to escape from prison.</i>

60
00:03:08,573 --> 00:03:11,474
If I could find Dad, I'd be off the hook.
I could be president again.

61
00:03:11,576 --> 00:03:14,374
- Where is it?
- Mexico.

62
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:17,710
You get the country for free.
The city-That's gonna cost ya.

63
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:23,879
- It's a $200 fine.
- Oh!

64
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:26,253
I feel like such an-

65
00:03:26,358 --> 00:03:28,258
The car is in
a town called Encanta.

66
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,158
If you think that's worth more than $200,
I'd really appreciate it.

67
00:03:31,263 --> 00:03:33,561
- All right. Here.
- I'm not even gonna count it.

68
00:03:35,167 --> 00:03:37,897
You can leave tomorrow
after my going-away party for Buster.

69
00:03:38,003 --> 00:03:40,563
I still can't believe
he's going into the army.

70
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,572
You know, he's doing it
just to spite me.

71
00:03:42,674 --> 00:03:45,234
- Then why are you throwing him a party?
- Just to spite him.

72
00:03:45,343 --> 00:03:47,174
You guys have such
a healthy thing going.

73
00:03:47,279 --> 00:03:49,804
Okay, I'll go to your party,
and then I'll go to Mexico.

74
00:03:49,915 --> 00:03:52,816
- I guess that'll be my quality time with my son.
- Mexico?

75
00:03:52,918 --> 00:03:57,252
- Yeah. Mom's P.I. Found the stair car down there.
- Gene Parmesan?

76
00:03:57,355 --> 00:04:00,449
Right here.

77
00:04:00,559 --> 00:04:03,084
I counted it. Come on.

78
00:04:03,195 --> 00:04:05,186
<i>And that's when Gob became suspicious...</i>

79
00:04:05,297 --> 00:04:09,427
<i>that Michael had only made him president
to stick him with the failing business...</i>

80
00:04:09,534 --> 00:04:13,334
<i>while Michael himself
escaped to Mexico to be with his father.</i>

81
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:17,306
<i>- So, inspired by his mother's private detective-
- "Ice."</i>

82
00:04:17,409 --> 00:04:20,503
<i>He decided to hire someone
to keep an eye on his brother.</i>

83
00:04:20,612 --> 00:04:24,776
I think I might have someone
who's going to "cirsumvrent" the law.

84
00:04:24,883 --> 00:04:27,875
<i>And Michael returned home,
eager to tell his son of their trip.</i>

85
00:04:27,986 --> 00:04:30,181
George Michael,
what say you and I take a road trip...

86
00:04:30,288 --> 00:04:32,950
down to Mexico tomorrow
right after Buster's party?

87
00:04:33,058 --> 00:04:35,652
- Oh, I can't. I'm meeting Ann.
- Who?

88
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,388
Ann. Here. You took
this picture of us...

89
00:04:38,496 --> 00:04:41,397
in front of that bagel place
before it was burned down.

90
00:04:41,499 --> 00:04:44,059
I guess I thought
she was with another family.

91
00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:46,637
She's kind of my girlfriend.

92
00:04:46,738 --> 00:04:49,002
- Her?
- Do you not like her?

93
00:04:49,107 --> 00:04:51,803
I don't know her.
It's like you spend all your time with her.

94
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:55,243
It's like you're hoggin' her-
like you're a little Ann hog.

95
00:04:55,347 --> 00:04:58,248
Okay? Don't be such an Ann hog.
But we're gonna go to Mexico.

96
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:00,318
Try to find Pop-Pop.
It'll be an adventure.

97
00:05:00,418 --> 00:05:02,352
Well-

98
00:05:02,454 --> 00:05:05,548
And 8:01. Curtain has risen.

99
00:05:05,657 --> 00:05:09,753
Hey, Tobias, I was wondering if you were
available tomorrow to go down to Mexico.

100
00:05:09,861 --> 00:05:12,591
- I need two drivers.
- Alas, I have two shows tomorrow...

101
00:05:12,697 --> 00:05:14,756
<i>where I'm on standby
for the Blue Man Group.</i>

102
00:05:14,866 --> 00:05:19,166
Might as well keep this makeup on
since it takes so- long to get off.

103
00:05:19,271 --> 00:05:21,171
Hmm. Lindsay, what about you?

104
00:05:21,273 --> 00:05:24,003
Uh, can't. I have
a big date tomorrow.

105
00:05:24,109 --> 00:05:27,101
You know, this open marriage is ridiculous.
Somebody's gonna get hurt.

106
00:05:27,212 --> 00:05:30,477
The important thing is
that you guys don't lose focus on yourselves.

107
00:05:33,018 --> 00:05:35,009
First of all,
we are doing this for her.

108
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,782
Okay? Because neither one of us
wants to get divorced.

109
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:41,086
<i>And "second-of-ly,"
I know you're the big marriage expert-</i>

110
00:05:41,192 --> 00:05:46,220
Oh. I'm sorry. I forgot. Your wife is dead.

111
00:05:49,234 --> 00:05:53,534
I'm sorry. That was 100% inappropriate,
and I do apologize profusely.

112
00:05:53,638 --> 00:05:56,539
I'm- Oh.

113
00:05:56,641 --> 00:05:58,700
Okay, look. I don't
have a date tomorrow.

114
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,710
But why can't you ask
Gob to go with you?

115
00:06:00,812 --> 00:06:03,440
<i>Michael and Gob had been to Mexico once before.</i>

116
00:06:03,548 --> 00:06:06,540
- Chiclet? Chiclet?
- You're the Chiclet! Not me!

117
00:06:06,651 --> 00:06:08,778
<i>Unfortunately, in Mexican culture...</i>

118
00:06:08,887 --> 00:06:11,788
<i>this was a much more
inflammatory gesture.</i>

119
00:06:19,597 --> 00:06:21,997
Hey, hey.

120
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,796
<i>I just think you and I would have
a lot more fun.</i>

121
00:06:24,903 --> 00:06:27,872
- Plus you can bring Maeby.
- You know, I've sensed her...

122
00:06:27,972 --> 00:06:30,668
feeling a little
left out lately.

123
00:06:30,775 --> 00:06:34,541
<i>And the next morning,
the family met at Buster's send-off party...</i>

124
00:06:34,646 --> 00:06:37,114
<i>where Lucille was not keeping
her feelings hidden.</i>

125
00:06:37,215 --> 00:06:39,945
- A camcorder.
- That's so you can videotape it...

126
00:06:40,051 --> 00:06:43,953
when they put you in a naked pyramid
and point to your Charlie Browns.

127
00:06:44,055 --> 00:06:46,080
I ought to point to
Uncle Oscar's Charlie Browns...

128
00:06:46,191 --> 00:06:48,091
next time you're
on top of him, Mother.

129
00:06:48,193 --> 00:06:51,924
He's moving out.
See how he treats me?

130
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:55,557
<i>Just because he thinks
I'm having an affair with the boy's uncle.</i>

131
00:06:55,667 --> 00:06:59,797
Yes. And she's not having an affair
with the boy's... uncle.

132
00:07:01,706 --> 00:07:05,043
It's too late for apologies.
I'm going to the army.

133
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:07,601
Get me out.
You've got to get me out.

134
00:07:07,712 --> 00:07:09,612
Well, I'm headed down
to Mexico to find Dad...

135
00:07:09,714 --> 00:07:11,944
but when I get back,
maybe we'll try to figure something out.

136
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,611
<i>And that's when Buster decided
to sneak into Mexico to avoid the service.</i>

137
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,781
No, no. I think it'll be worked out by then.

138
00:07:19,891 --> 00:07:22,553
- What was that all about?
- I think Buster's gonna escape to Mexico.

139
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:26,118
Did the secretary not give you the picture
for Dad? I need that to show people there.

140
00:07:26,231 --> 00:07:30,292
<i>- Yeah. She brought that over.
- Well, this, uh, is a blueprint...</i>

141
00:07:30,402 --> 00:07:32,893
of Dad's face.

142
00:07:33,004 --> 00:07:36,633
- She used the big printer.
I'll give her that. Let's go.
- Not so fast.

143
00:07:36,741 --> 00:07:40,006
- Gob, who is that man on the couch?
- Who? That guy?

144
00:07:40,111 --> 00:07:43,080
- He's my friend.
- You don't have any friends.

145
00:07:43,181 --> 00:07:45,081
I have lots of friends,
Lindsay.

146
00:07:45,183 --> 00:07:47,344
<i>In fact, the man was Ice, a bounty hunter...</i>

147
00:07:47,452 --> 00:07:49,352
<i>that Gob hired
to follow Michael.</i>

148
00:07:49,454 --> 00:07:51,979
- Ice may be my best friend.
- George Michael.

149
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:54,820
- He's moving.
- He's moving.

150
00:07:54,926 --> 00:07:57,156
- Fun party, huh?
- No. No, it isn't.

151
00:07:57,262 --> 00:07:59,753
- Let's go down to Mexico.
- All right. Let me grab Ann real quick.

152
00:07:59,864 --> 00:08:02,094
- Ann's here?
- Yeah. I invited her.

153
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,000
You said you wanted to spend some time with her.
You said I was being an Ann hog.

154
00:08:06,104 --> 00:08:09,039
- Ann Hog's coming? I thought
it was just the two of us.
- Just Ann.

155
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,335
- All right. Load her up in the car.
- All right.

156
00:08:11,443 --> 00:08:14,674
Lupe, that sweater's
not a take-home.

157
00:08:14,779 --> 00:08:18,943
- Michael, give her a ride home.
- I'm gonna have to start
putting people in the trunk.

158
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:23,714
<i>In fact, at that moment,
Buster was climbing into the trunk.</i>

159
00:08:27,859 --> 00:08:31,351
Mother, when you see this videotape,
you'll know that I left.

160
00:08:31,463 --> 00:08:33,693
Not out of cowardice,
but out of-

161
00:08:34,933 --> 00:08:37,424
Oh, man.
It's tiring in here.

162
00:08:39,103 --> 00:08:41,003
Oh.

163
00:08:42,841 --> 00:08:46,208
<i>Six minutes later,
Michael dropped offhis mother's housekeeper.</i>

164
00:08:47,812 --> 00:08:49,712
Mexico.

165
00:08:49,814 --> 00:08:52,840
<i>In fact, he was in Santa Ana...</i>

166
00:08:52,951 --> 00:08:55,545
<i>a town six minutes inland
from his own.</i>

167
00:08:55,653 --> 00:08:58,884
<i>But the combination oflosing his glasses
and breathing carbon monoxide...</i>

168
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:01,322
<i>had impaired Buster's judgment.</i>

169
00:09:01,426 --> 00:09:05,419
Oh, this shall keep me safe
from the hot Mexican sun.

170
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:08,556
<i>Excuse me. What are you doing?</i>

171
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:12,261
I'm trying to find a place to live.

172
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:16,830
<i>Ay.</i>

173
00:09:21,345 --> 00:09:23,905
<i>Michael was heading down to Mexico...</i>

174
00:09:24,014 --> 00:09:25,914
<i>to find his fugitive father.</i>

175
00:09:26,016 --> 00:09:28,951
Can you believe this?
This is my trip with my son...

176
00:09:29,053 --> 00:09:31,988
and he's too busy whispering secrets
to Ann to say one word to me.

177
00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:34,785
- What's that?
- Nothing.

178
00:09:34,892 --> 00:09:37,952
We're not
whispering secrets up here.

179
00:09:38,062 --> 00:09:40,326
<i>Hey. Check out who's on that hog
in the rearview mirror.</i>

180
00:09:40,431 --> 00:09:42,763
- George Michael!
- What?

181
00:09:42,866 --> 00:09:45,801
Twenty miles to LEGOLAND.

182
00:09:48,706 --> 00:09:50,674
The Ice.

183
00:09:50,774 --> 00:09:54,767
- What have you got?
- Still on his tail, about 20 miles from LEGOLAND.

184
00:09:54,878 --> 00:09:58,507
- Go get him, friend.
- You're not my friend. You're a client.

185
00:09:58,615 --> 00:10:02,449
<i>Gob realized that perhaps
he really didn't have any friends.</i>

186
00:10:02,553 --> 00:10:04,817
<i>And Lucille sent hers away.</i>

187
00:10:04,922 --> 00:10:07,049
Buster, Oscar's leaving.
You win.

188
00:10:07,157 --> 00:10:08,988
Buster get in trunk
of car.

189
00:10:09,093 --> 00:10:11,459
So he's not going
to the army.

190
00:10:11,562 --> 00:10:15,498
<i>He must have had Michael
sneak him into Mexico. Oh, thank God.</i>

191
00:10:15,599 --> 00:10:17,829
- It's better this way. Mmm.
- Mmm.

192
00:10:17,935 --> 00:10:19,562
I'll go unpack.

193
00:10:21,805 --> 00:10:25,138
<i>Here's some money. Go see a Star War.</i>

194
00:10:25,242 --> 00:10:27,369
<i>- Who is it?
- Uh, your son.</i>

195
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,577
- What?
- I was looking for Buster.

196
00:10:31,682 --> 00:10:34,207
- He's not here.
- Uh, what are you doing?

197
00:10:34,318 --> 00:10:38,482
<i>- I mean, do you want to go out?
- Why are you trying to get me out of the house?</i>

198
00:10:38,589 --> 00:10:41,080
I just thought
that we could hang out.

199
00:10:44,361 --> 00:10:48,695
<i>Lucille was suspicious
that Gob was up to some sort of power grab.</i>

200
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:51,393
Gene Parmesan?
Lucille Bluth.

201
00:10:51,502 --> 00:10:54,062
My son is trying to
get me out of my house.

202
00:10:54,171 --> 00:10:56,537
I think he may be up to something.

203
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,040
Oh. Hold on.
That's probably him.

204
00:11:02,146 --> 00:11:04,011
Gene?

205
00:11:04,114 --> 00:11:06,674
It's just some idiot
with balloons.

206
00:11:06,784 --> 00:11:11,312
- Oh, is it?
- I knew it!

207
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:13,889
I want you to keep an eye
on my son Gob.

208
00:11:15,459 --> 00:11:17,723
<i>And Buster was finding himself right at home.</i>

209
00:11:17,828 --> 00:11:20,388
Oh, my God.
I used to have a shirt just like that.

210
00:11:20,497 --> 00:11:23,330
<i>It was Buster's old shirt.
Lucille had given it to Lupe.</i>

211
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:27,460
And the hand chair. I had one in my room.
I wonder where that went.

212
00:11:27,571 --> 00:11:30,597
<i>- It went right there.
- I never thought I'd miss a hand so much.</i>

213
00:11:30,707 --> 00:11:33,073
You people are just like me.

214
00:11:34,311 --> 00:11:36,370
<i>Meanwhile, in the real Mexico...</i>

215
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,710
<i>- Michael had found the stair car.
- There it is.</i>

216
00:11:40,317 --> 00:11:42,478
<i>And Michael set about
finding his father.</i>

217
00:11:42,586 --> 00:11:46,545
<i>Oh, yeah. Sure, señor. No problem.
When do you want us to start building?</i>

218
00:11:47,758 --> 00:11:49,658
<i>Thank you.
Gracias.</i>

219
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,785
<i>- Dad? Dad?
- Yeah.</i>

220
00:11:51,895 --> 00:11:53,795
So, what do you
think of Ann so far?

221
00:11:53,897 --> 00:11:57,731
Oh, Ann? I just-
You know, I barely know her.

222
00:11:57,835 --> 00:12:02,397
You know? Neither of us do. She's just really
some girl as far as we're concerned. Right?

223
00:12:02,506 --> 00:12:04,838
- L-l-I'm determined to get to know her.
- Yeah.

224
00:12:04,942 --> 00:12:07,274
- Okay?
- Okay. I have an idea. When we go back...

225
00:12:07,377 --> 00:12:10,244
why don't just the two of you go back
in the stair car together?

226
00:12:10,347 --> 00:12:12,474
Well, that's no fun.

227
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:15,074
For you. You know,
you guys should be together.

228
00:12:15,185 --> 00:12:17,847
- Oh-
- Or maybe just you and me...

229
00:12:17,955 --> 00:12:20,185
- if you'd rather.
- Yeah.

230
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:23,088
- Or me and Ann-
- Great! Yes. Okay.

231
00:12:23,193 --> 00:12:26,094
I'll tell Maeby that I'll be going back
with her and Aunt Lindsay. Great.

232
00:12:26,196 --> 00:12:28,494
- No, no. Wait. Let's keep looking for Pop-Pop.
- Okay.

233
00:12:28,599 --> 00:12:31,466
Maybe somebody in the church
will know something.

234
00:12:31,568 --> 00:12:34,731
<i>In fact, George Sr.
Was in the church, where he was mourned...</i>

235
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:39,104
<i>by his longtime assistant
and accomplice to his escape, Kitty...</i>

236
00:12:39,209 --> 00:12:42,508
<i>as only a few days earlier,
he'd been declared dead.</i>

237
00:12:44,615 --> 00:12:47,175
<i>But before Michael could go inside the church-</i>

238
00:12:48,218 --> 00:12:51,016
Hey. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

239
00:12:51,121 --> 00:12:54,648
- I know you. You're Gob's friend.
- Not friend. Bounty hunter.

240
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:58,023
Gene? There's no way
you're that good.

241
00:12:58,128 --> 00:13:01,620
Name's Ice. Gob hired me to stop you
from fleeing the country.

242
00:13:01,732 --> 00:13:06,863
What? Are you kidding me? I'm not fleeing
the country. I'm here looking for my father.

243
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:09,632
But you're obviously better
at this kind of thing. I'll tell you what.

244
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:13,642
I'm gonna continue paying you
to find my father.

245
00:13:13,744 --> 00:13:16,144
You can also collect
the real bounty on his head.

246
00:13:16,246 --> 00:13:18,840
Nice deck.
Is this where you saw him last?

247
00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:20,883
No, this-
That's actually him.

248
00:13:20,984 --> 00:13:23,919
- He's just- He's much smaller in real life.
- I can see that's a man.

249
00:13:24,021 --> 00:13:26,387
I'll find him.

250
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:30,426
<i>- Lucky.
- What did he say? Did he ask about me?</i>

251
00:13:30,527 --> 00:13:32,893
I can't believe he followed us
all the way to Mexico.

252
00:13:32,996 --> 00:13:37,023
Uh, that's a bounty hunter, and, uh,
he's on the case, so we can all head home.

253
00:13:37,134 --> 00:13:40,661
So, he's not interested in me?

254
00:13:40,771 --> 00:13:42,830
Not unless
you know where Dad is.

255
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,908
George Michael.

256
00:13:48,979 --> 00:13:53,313
Oh, hi, Dad. Yeah. They think you're in Mexico.
I'll see you when I get home.

257
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:58,616
<i>Ye- Oh, yes. Thank you. No, I found
my birth control pills. Thanks for asking, Dad.</i>

258
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:02,349
<i>Maeby had had enough ofher mother...</i>

259
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:04,359
<i>and decided to go back
with Michael.</i>

260
00:14:04,461 --> 00:14:07,055
I'm so sick of her.
The lame flirting.

261
00:14:07,164 --> 00:14:09,655
<i>Michael, of course,
thought Maeby was referring to Ann.</i>

262
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:12,530
I think he's gonna get sick of her
before it goes too far.

263
00:14:12,636 --> 00:14:14,763
Of course he will.
She's a child.

264
00:14:14,871 --> 00:14:16,805
Well, that- that part's
not really her fault.

265
00:14:16,907 --> 00:14:19,102
I just hate to see him
wasting his time, you know?

266
00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:22,269
- Let's go. I'll be in your car.
- Is George Michael okay with that?

267
00:14:22,379 --> 00:14:24,711
<i>- It's fine. Just drive.
- At no point...</i>

268
00:14:24,815 --> 00:14:27,045
<i>were Michael and Maeby
talking about the same person.</i>

269
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:29,243
<i>And there were only
four people in their group.</i>

270
00:14:29,353 --> 00:14:31,188
And it's not a race thing.

271
00:14:31,254 --> 00:14:33,222
Yeah. Whoever
gets there first.

272
00:14:33,323 --> 00:14:36,884
<i>And so Michael left with his niece...</i>

273
00:14:36,994 --> 00:14:40,293
<i>followed by his sister
and his son...</i>

274
00:14:40,397 --> 00:14:42,297
<i>followed by the bounty hunter.</i>

275
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:48,167
<i>Unfortunately, this left the girl Michael was
determined to get to know alone in Mexico.</i>

276
00:14:48,271 --> 00:14:52,765
<i>Meanwhile, Buster was adapting
to life in what he thought was Mexico...</i>

277
00:14:52,876 --> 00:14:56,277
<i>but was in fact a town so close to home
that they shared a paperboy.</i>

278
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:59,110
I know that guy.
Hey! Where's your mother?

279
00:14:59,216 --> 00:15:01,411
Oh, I love this way of life.
This is where I belong.

280
00:15:01,518 --> 00:15:03,486
I love being Mexican.

281
00:15:03,587 --> 00:15:07,523
<i>- We must work now, amigo. Adiós.
- Oh, no. I'm going with you.</i>

282
00:15:07,624 --> 00:15:11,082
<i>I am one of you now. Ssí?</i>

283
00:15:11,194 --> 00:15:13,992
<i>And Michael,
on his way back home, bonded with Maeby.</i>

284
00:15:14,097 --> 00:15:16,930
I mean, why does everyone
have to date anyways?

285
00:15:17,034 --> 00:15:19,525
Right. I mean, isn't family
enough for people?

286
00:15:19,636 --> 00:15:23,663
<i>And, you know, not to feel sorry for myself,
but it's like I'm being forgotten here.</i>

287
00:15:26,143 --> 00:15:29,271
<i>And soon they all arrived at home.</i>

288
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:31,506
- Hey. You're here already.
- Yeah. We won.

289
00:15:31,615 --> 00:15:33,845
So, uh, you guys have
a good talk?

290
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:37,716
Yeah. Great talk. That cousin of yours
is a hell of a girl. Too bad you can't date her.

291
00:15:37,821 --> 00:15:40,949
No. I meant-Wait, you wouldn't have
a problem with that?

292
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:45,694
Nothing. No, I was
talking about Ann.

293
00:15:45,796 --> 00:15:47,787
What did you think of her?

294
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:02,659
<i>Michael had just discovered
he'd left his son's girlfriend in Mexico.</i>

295
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:06,536
She's gonna be fine.
We just gotta beat the sun.

296
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:10,435
Hey. You think I'm happy
about this?

297
00:16:10,545 --> 00:16:12,877
But, hey, we are getting
that trip together we wanted, huh?

298
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,039
And look. Two exits
to LEGOLAND.

299
00:16:15,149 --> 00:16:17,117
I just want to find Ann.

300
00:16:17,218 --> 00:16:18,981
That's my whole thing too.

301
00:16:20,421 --> 00:16:22,651
<i>And Gob was still searching for a friend.</i>

302
00:16:22,757 --> 00:16:27,421
- Show tonight?
- Well, I won't know officially until 8:01...

303
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:31,055
but I figured
if I blue myself early...

304
00:16:31,165 --> 00:16:35,397
I'd be nice and relaxed for
a 9:00 dinner reservation.

305
00:16:35,503 --> 00:16:37,994
And if you'd like,
I can make that reservation for-

306
00:16:38,106 --> 00:16:41,007
- Looking for some company or-
- I sure am.

307
00:16:43,511 --> 00:16:45,775
What are you doing?
You're gonna scare away the Ice.

308
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,338
Ice? Ice is out there?
Where's Michael?

309
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:51,418
He went back to Mexico.

310
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,079
Hmm. I knew he was
trying to flee.

311
00:16:54,188 --> 00:16:55,849
<i>Where the hell did he go?</i>

312
00:16:55,957 --> 00:16:57,891
Whoa!

313
00:16:57,992 --> 00:17:00,859
- Ice, what are you doing?
- George Bluth, you're coming with me.

314
00:17:00,962 --> 00:17:03,692
<i>- That's not my father.
- Well, according to my photograph...</i>

315
00:17:03,798 --> 00:17:05,789
it is.

316
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:10,337
It's an honest mistake.
Also, I think your knee is on my heart.

317
00:17:10,438 --> 00:17:13,236
He's my husband.
My father is probably still in Mexico.

318
00:17:13,341 --> 00:17:16,833
- I was just hoping to have sex with you.
- Why am I not blacking out?

319
00:17:16,944 --> 00:17:20,004
He set me up.
Michael set me up.

320
00:17:20,114 --> 00:17:23,379
Hey. Who wants to go to the hospital?

321
00:17:23,484 --> 00:17:26,009
<i>And Buster went to his job as a dishwasher.</i>

322
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,588
This is great. We're like slave buddies.

323
00:17:28,689 --> 00:17:31,055
Oh.

324
00:17:31,159 --> 00:17:35,255
<i>Soon, the guys arrived
in Mexico and split up to find Ann.</i>

325
00:17:35,363 --> 00:17:38,298
Ann? Ann?
Oh, thank God, you're all right.

326
00:17:38,399 --> 00:17:42,028
- Mr. Bluth?
- Ann. Oh, thank God, you're all right.

327
00:17:42,136 --> 00:17:45,731
Uh, you are Ann, right?
Yes. Of course you are.

328
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,365
<i>- Ann. Oh, my-
- It is. We got her.</i>

329
00:17:48,476 --> 00:17:52,469
Okay. Let's go ahead and load up in the truck.
I think we're crashing some poor guy's wake.

330
00:17:53,815 --> 00:17:56,784
Michael, Michael, Michael!

331
00:17:56,884 --> 00:17:59,409
- Gob? What are you doing?
- Fleeing the country. You bastard.

332
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,420
No. I'm still not
fleeing. Okay?

333
00:18:01,522 --> 00:18:03,581
I'm just here to pick up
my son's girlfriend.

334
00:18:03,691 --> 00:18:05,659
She ran off the last time
we were leaving.

335
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,696
- Actually, I was sitting right there the whole time.
- Yeah? Way to plant, Ann.

336
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:12,732
George Michael, uh, listen.
Why don't you and Plant wait in the stair car.

337
00:18:12,834 --> 00:18:15,496
- I'm gonna finish up with Gob.
- What a scare.

338
00:18:15,603 --> 00:18:17,332
- That's his girlfriend?
- Yeah.

339
00:18:17,438 --> 00:18:19,429
- Is she funny or something?
- Don't worry about it.

340
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:22,509
- Why do you keep thinking that I'm running away?
- It is kind of suspicious.

341
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:24,908
You didn't even ask me
to drive down here with you.

342
00:18:25,012 --> 00:18:28,812
The only reason I didn't ask you to come
is because of your chicken impression.

343
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:31,612
- We sure did get in a lot
of trouble for that last time.
- Yeah.

344
00:18:31,719 --> 00:18:34,279
- I was all-
- Hey, no. You're doing it again.

345
00:18:36,724 --> 00:18:38,954
Get off him. He doesn't know
what he's doing. He's American.

346
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,960
<i>Americano, eh?
Just like me.</i>

347
00:18:41,062 --> 00:18:43,587
Gene Parmesan.
How you doing?

348
00:18:43,698 --> 00:18:46,792
- Gene! What the hell are you doing?
- Your mother sent me to find you.

349
00:18:46,901 --> 00:18:50,997
- She was worried you were up to something.
- I was just looking for a friend.

350
00:18:51,105 --> 00:18:53,130
- What?
- Yeah, that's right, Michael.

351
00:18:53,241 --> 00:18:55,971
I went to our mother
because I don't have any friends.

352
00:18:56,077 --> 00:18:58,807
<i>- Oh, that's funny.
- Thank you.</i>

353
00:18:58,913 --> 00:19:00,847
Gene, can I have
a private moment, please?

354
00:19:00,948 --> 00:19:02,848
- Okay. You're on the clock.
- Thank you.

355
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:04,975
Gob, what are you
talking about?

356
00:19:05,086 --> 00:19:08,112
If anybody needs a friend right now, it's me.
My son's furious at me...

357
00:19:08,222 --> 00:19:12,022
and he spends all his free time with this girl
that, frankly, I'm not that crazy about.

358
00:19:12,126 --> 00:19:14,788
Not crazy about?
Or not crazy about your son growing up?

359
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:19,223
Uh- Maybe- Maybe
you're right about that.

360
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,699
And I really haven't
gotten to know her.

361
00:19:21,802 --> 00:19:24,236
I've been
a little selfish. So-

362
00:19:24,338 --> 00:19:26,465
See? You are a friend.

363
00:19:26,574 --> 00:19:29,702
You know, I'm- I'm always gonna
look out for you. All right?

364
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:32,643
And you're always gonna
look out for me.

365
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:38,950
Sorry. I did see him
coming. It's just...

366
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:41,715
I kind of wanted to see
where you were going with that.

367
00:19:45,626 --> 00:19:47,526
Where's Uncle Gob?

368
00:19:47,628 --> 00:19:50,495
<i>Well, I gave the bounty hunter
and the P. I...</i>

369
00:19:50,598 --> 00:19:52,998
a few extra bucks to be his friends
for the weekend-

370
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,931
while the three of them
are looking for my father.

371
00:19:55,036 --> 00:19:57,402
And I want to get to know
a new friend too.

372
00:19:57,505 --> 00:20:03,205
Ann, why don't you tell me
a little bit about yourself?

373
00:20:04,512 --> 00:20:07,606
<i>The next day, Buster was happy.</i>

374
00:20:07,715 --> 00:20:12,049
<i>And he decided to never go home again.</i>

375
00:20:12,153 --> 00:20:15,020
<i>Delivery from the kitchen.
- But unfortunately,
he was already there.</i>

376
00:20:15,122 --> 00:20:17,556
- Mother!
- Buster!

377
00:20:17,658 --> 00:20:20,718
- I thought you were in Mexico.
- So did I.

378
00:20:20,828 --> 00:20:23,888
<i>Oh!
- And the next day,
Michael returned to work...</i>

379
00:20:23,998 --> 00:20:26,091
<i>knowing a little more
about his son's girlfriend.</i>

380
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,499
Tell Ann to make sure she studies
for Mr. Mason's Algebra II test tomorrow...

381
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:33,369
and tell her to make sure that Kim Cho
doesn't cheat off her this time.

382
00:20:35,076 --> 00:20:36,907
Wow. You really
got to know her.

383
00:20:37,011 --> 00:20:39,479
Well, we did spend
three hours together in that car ride.

384
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:42,572
- So, what'd you think?
- I don't like her.

385
00:20:42,683 --> 00:20:45,083
<i>On the next Arrested Development.</i>

386
00:20:45,186 --> 00:20:48,246
<i>Buster reclaims
his favorite chair.</i>

387
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:52,950
<i>But the victory is short-lived.</i>

388
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:56,052
Make love in
your own hand, Mother!

389
00:20:56,163 --> 00:20:57,926
<i>And Tobias gets
medical attention.</i>

390
00:20:58,032 --> 00:21:00,933
Thank God! A new doctor. Finally we can get
a straight answer in this place.

391
00:21:01,035 --> 00:21:03,936
Uh, I've got
some bad news.

392
00:21:04,038 --> 00:21:06,939
I'm Gene Parmesan. How you doin'?

393
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:09,407
He got me again!

394
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:13,446
But I did overhear that
he's bleeding internally.
