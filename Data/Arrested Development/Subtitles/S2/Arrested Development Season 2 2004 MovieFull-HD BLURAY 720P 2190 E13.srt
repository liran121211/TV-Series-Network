1
00:00:00,979 --> 00:00:04,415
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:04,516 --> 00:00:06,507
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:06,618 --> 00:00:08,609
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:14,159 --> 00:00:15,854
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

5
00:00:19,464 --> 00:00:21,432
<i>Michael Bluth had gotten up early...</i>

6
00:00:21,533 --> 00:00:24,525
<i>in the hopes of avoiding his family.</i>

7
00:00:24,636 --> 00:00:28,663
<i>His mother, however, was already dressed,
made up and waiting for him-</i>

8
00:00:28,774 --> 00:00:30,867
<i>- Good morning.
- Ooh!</i>

9
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:34,070
<i>Which put her wake-up time
in the 3:00, 3:30 area.</i>

10
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:37,376
<i>I couldn't sleep.
I always get this way before Motherboy.</i>

11
00:00:37,482 --> 00:00:39,712
Oh, God.
It's Motherboy already?

12
00:00:39,818 --> 00:00:44,084
<i>Motherboy was a dinner dance
aimed at promoting mother-son bonding.</i>

13
00:00:44,189 --> 00:00:47,716
<i>Lucille had gone
over 25 times with Buster...</i>

14
00:00:47,826 --> 00:00:51,353
<i>and on a few occasions,
had won Cutest Couple.</i>

15
00:00:51,463 --> 00:00:54,364
<i>As one entered sexual maturity,
and the other one left it...</i>

16
00:00:54,466 --> 00:00:56,400
<i>it became harder to win.</i>

17
00:00:56,501 --> 00:00:59,868
- I'm so hot.
- If you were hot, Mother, we would win.

18
00:00:59,971 --> 00:01:03,304
<i>It's not just Motherboy.
It's Motherboy XXX!</i>

19
00:01:03,408 --> 00:01:06,969
- And I think with you, I've got a shot.
- Oh, no.

20
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:10,344
- Buster, for the first time ever,
doesn't want to do this?
- No, he does.

21
00:01:10,449 --> 00:01:12,576
It's just,
he's been so mopey.

22
00:01:12,684 --> 00:01:15,653
That could have something to do
with the fact that a seal ate his hand.

23
00:01:15,754 --> 00:01:18,552
- I don't know what it is.
- I think that's what it is.

24
00:01:18,657 --> 00:01:21,319
<i>- Who knows?
- It was that.</i>

25
00:01:21,426 --> 00:01:24,691
<i>It had happened weeks earlier when Buster
went swimming in the ocean...</i>

26
00:01:24,796 --> 00:01:28,459
<i>against his mother's wishes.</i>

27
00:01:28,567 --> 00:01:30,899
<i>He had become haunted by the loss...</i>

28
00:01:31,002 --> 00:01:34,802
<i>seeing reminders of the accident everywhere.</i>

29
00:01:43,348 --> 00:01:48,251
<i>Mother, I can't sleep. I may not be able
to go to dance practice today.</i>

30
00:01:48,353 --> 00:01:50,150
I'm going out. Zip me up.

31
00:01:50,255 --> 00:01:52,314
<i>I mean,
look how he zips now.</i>

32
00:01:52,424 --> 00:01:55,052
I know what this is. You're embarrassed
by him, aren't you?

33
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,094
You spent your whole life
over-mothering the guy...

34
00:01:57,195 --> 00:01:59,425
and when he finally needs you,
you're not there.

35
00:01:59,531 --> 00:02:01,431
Well, I don't see you
spending time with him.

36
00:02:01,533 --> 00:02:05,025
<i>The Bluth children had been
uneasy about missing limbs...</i>

37
00:02:05,137 --> 00:02:08,629
<i>since their father used a one-armed man
to teach them lessons.</i>

38
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,174
That's why you don't yell.

39
00:02:11,276 --> 00:02:15,337
As a matter of fact, I'm going to see Buster today.

40
00:02:15,447 --> 00:02:18,439
So you're gonna have to find a different
dance partner for Motherboy.

41
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:22,111
God. Not that "I'm in love
with my mother" dance thing.

42
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:25,280
I'm so glad there wasn't one of
those for daddies and daughters.

43
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:28,882
- Of course they have father-daughter dances.
- They do? He never took me?

44
00:02:28,994 --> 00:02:32,725
It was before we did your nose.
Toodle-oo.

45
00:02:32,831 --> 00:02:35,800
- You're up awful early.
- Well, my marriage is falling apart.

46
00:02:35,901 --> 00:02:39,803
<i>- Tobias is back with Carl.
- Tobias had gotten a call...</i>

47
00:02:39,905 --> 00:02:43,068
<i>from his one-time acting
teacher, Carl Weathers.</i>

48
00:02:43,175 --> 00:02:48,306
He's directing something for TV,
but he thinks he might have a part for me.

49
00:02:48,413 --> 00:02:52,816
<i>If this takes off, I might be able to buy you
the happiness that you deserve.</i>

50
00:02:52,918 --> 00:02:55,944
He said the same thing when he got cast as
Frightened Inmate Number Two...

51
00:02:56,054 --> 00:02:58,181
in that film he got fired from.

52
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:02,249
<i>He had even gotten a vanity plate
made up announcing the achievement.</i>

53
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,488
<i>And this wasn't the first time.</i>

54
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,736
He's so clueless.
He's not your real "take charge" husband.

55
00:03:12,837 --> 00:03:15,829
Lindsay, you're still looking
for somebody like Daddy, okay?

56
00:03:15,941 --> 00:03:19,570
Let's not forget that he was also
dismissive and disinterested.

57
00:03:19,678 --> 00:03:21,669
No. No, he had good qualities.

58
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,578
<i>Actually, George Sr. Was secretly living...</i>

59
00:03:24,683 --> 00:03:28,175
<i>- in the attic above them
and was starved for company-
- Nellie.</i>

60
00:03:28,286 --> 00:03:29,719
Now-

61
00:03:29,821 --> 00:03:32,346
who wants to take their top off?

62
00:03:32,457 --> 00:03:35,017
<i>when George Michael and Maeby came in.</i>

63
00:03:35,126 --> 00:03:38,254
<i>So you and Ann are actually going on
a Christian camping trip?</i>

64
00:03:38,363 --> 00:03:41,457
It's called the Promise Land.
You're supposed to make promises...

65
00:03:41,566 --> 00:03:45,730
about your relationship as a tribute to
the generations that preceded you.

66
00:03:45,837 --> 00:03:47,737
Hey, there's booze in this.

67
00:03:47,839 --> 00:03:50,307
That's the Promise Land
that Ann's taking you to?

68
00:03:50,408 --> 00:03:52,740
You're gonna need this
more than Polly here.

69
00:03:52,844 --> 00:03:57,213
<i>- That one's Polly?
- Hey! What are you kids doin' up here?</i>

70
00:03:57,315 --> 00:04:00,716
We're lookin' for the camping stuff. Do you
know where the pump is for the air mattress?

71
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:04,220
I had to take all pumps
out of here a long time ago.

72
00:04:04,322 --> 00:04:06,119
Take this down to
the kitchen, will you?

73
00:04:06,224 --> 00:04:08,283
I think it's getting too risky
keeping you up here.

74
00:04:08,393 --> 00:04:11,055
You know what's risky?
Lettin' your son go on that church thing.

75
00:04:11,162 --> 00:04:13,562
Her name's Ann, Dad,
and he's not "going" on her, okay?

76
00:04:13,665 --> 00:04:15,565
<i>- They're just friends.
- Not for long.</i>

77
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:17,658
They're making promises
to each other.

78
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:21,500
It's all that fidelity and pledging
yourself to a woman garbage.

79
00:04:21,606 --> 00:04:24,074
<i>I wine 'em and dine 'em,
but I don't let 'em tell me what to do.</i>

80
00:04:24,175 --> 00:04:29,010
I don't... let 'em tell me...
what to do.

81
00:04:30,682 --> 00:04:32,650
<i>Okay, I should've never taken
the pumps out ofhere.</i>

82
00:04:32,751 --> 00:04:36,585
<i>Listen, unlike you,
I respect my son's choices.</i>

83
00:04:36,688 --> 00:04:40,317
<i>George Michael, I don't think you should
be going on this Promise Land thing.</i>

84
00:04:40,425 --> 00:04:42,086
What? Why?
Because I'd miss school?

85
00:04:42,193 --> 00:04:44,184
- No.
- You get to miss school for that?

86
00:04:44,296 --> 00:04:47,561
<i>And that's when Maeby decided
to become a devout Christian.</i>

87
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:51,102
Do you guys know where I could get one of
those gold necklaces with the "T" on it?

88
00:04:51,202 --> 00:04:54,171
- That's a cross.
- Across from where?

89
00:04:54,272 --> 00:04:57,264
Um, it's not about school, pal.
It's more about family.

90
00:04:57,375 --> 00:05:00,435
<i>Your Uncle Buster's been very depressed
lately, and you haven't visited him.</i>

91
00:05:00,545 --> 00:05:05,005
<i>Family first. Or did they not teach you that
at the Promise Land?</i>

92
00:05:05,116 --> 00:05:07,880
- I don't know. You won't let me go.
- Attaboy.

93
00:05:10,555 --> 00:05:13,524
<i>Michael then went to the office,
where he ran into Gob.</i>

94
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:17,152
Barry come by yet?
I need to talk to him about my divorce.

95
00:05:17,262 --> 00:05:19,753
<i>Gob had once
gotten married on a dare...</i>

96
00:05:19,864 --> 00:05:23,732
<i>a fact he'd only remembered
when he was served with divorce papers.</i>

97
00:05:23,835 --> 00:05:26,668
- That cow is going after me.
- Your wife? She was super-thin.

98
00:05:26,771 --> 00:05:28,170
- She was?
- Yeah.

99
00:05:28,273 --> 00:05:30,036
What about her cans?
She have big cans?

100
00:05:30,141 --> 00:05:33,008
- You don't remember her at all?
- It was one night of wild passion.

101
00:05:33,111 --> 00:05:36,638
- And yet you didn't notice her body.
- I like to look in the mirror.

102
00:05:36,748 --> 00:05:41,481
That would be disgusting if you'd actually
slept with her, but I don't think you did.

103
00:05:41,586 --> 00:05:45,420
<i>- I did! And it was disgusting.
- They didn't, but it would have been.</i>

104
00:05:45,523 --> 00:05:48,185
Anyway, remember that seal of hers
that I released into the ocean?

105
00:05:48,293 --> 00:05:50,193
- Bit off Buster's hand?
- Vaguely.

106
00:05:50,295 --> 00:05:53,162
Her lawyers are claiming
that the seal's worth 250 grand.

107
00:05:53,264 --> 00:05:55,164
And that's not even
including Buster's Swatch.

108
00:05:55,266 --> 00:05:59,066
Listen, Gob, if you admit in court that
you never consummated the marriage...

109
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:01,365
you can get it annulled
and walk away free and clear.

110
00:06:01,473 --> 00:06:05,170
You just can't deal with the fact that I've got
a super-thin wife with huge cans.

111
00:06:05,276 --> 00:06:08,245
All right. Who's ready to show
their lawyer some love?

112
00:06:08,346 --> 00:06:11,315
<i>The seal?
Must've had a tracking device on it.</i>

113
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,680
Someone tracked it all the way
to a dock in Dana Point.

114
00:06:13,785 --> 00:06:18,222
You know, if that hand is still intact inside
the seal, Buster's got a shot at a transplant.

115
00:06:18,323 --> 00:06:20,814
At the very least, we can get Buster's
Swatch back, right?

116
00:06:20,925 --> 00:06:22,893
Up top. No?

117
00:06:22,994 --> 00:06:24,562
<i>And Tobias met with
Carl Weathers at Burger King.</i>

118
00:06:24,562 --> 00:06:26,189
<i>And Tobias met with
Carl Weathers at Burger King.</i>

119
00:06:26,297 --> 00:06:28,094
Thanks for meeting me down here
at Burger King.

120
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:31,327
I'm tryin' to get them to underwrite
a new TV project I'm workin' on.

121
00:06:31,436 --> 00:06:34,872
Get some money in exchange
for settin' a scene here in Burger King.

122
00:06:34,973 --> 00:06:37,464
As long as you
don't draw attention to it.

123
00:06:37,575 --> 00:06:40,442
<i>I'm directing an episode
of the series Scandal Makers.</i>

124
00:06:40,545 --> 00:06:43,708
It's about the Bluth family and your
father-in-law's escape from justice.

125
00:06:43,815 --> 00:06:46,875
- I play the lead- a bounty hunter, name of Ice.
- Oh, no.

126
00:06:46,985 --> 00:06:49,044
You want me to play myself,
don't you?

127
00:06:49,154 --> 00:06:51,054
I swore I'd not go reality.

128
00:06:51,156 --> 00:06:54,887
- I will do-
- No, I already got a great guy
named Dave Attell to play you.

129
00:06:54,993 --> 00:06:56,961
I wasn't actually here
to ask you to be in it.

130
00:06:57,061 --> 00:06:59,154
I'm lookin' for somebody
in your family to sign a release.

131
00:07:01,132 --> 00:07:03,225
I could not betray my family
like that.

132
00:07:03,334 --> 00:07:06,633
Come on, man. I've got every part cast
except for George Sr.

133
00:07:06,738 --> 00:07:09,901
- I want that part.
- Then sign over the rights.

134
00:07:10,008 --> 00:07:12,067
I'm gonna go get a new soda.

135
00:07:12,177 --> 00:07:17,274
Did you know that you can get a refill
on any drink you want here, and it's free?

136
00:07:17,382 --> 00:07:19,907
It's a wonderful restaurant.

137
00:07:20,018 --> 00:07:24,352
<i>It sure is. George Michael,
meanwhile, spent an afternoon...</i>

138
00:07:24,456 --> 00:07:27,152
<i>- with his uncle, at his father's suggestion.
- King me.</i>

139
00:07:27,258 --> 00:07:29,658
Oh, God! I keep forgetting about this.

140
00:07:29,761 --> 00:07:33,754
- Oh, me too.
- Well, that's a do-over. So, who should go first?

141
00:07:33,865 --> 00:07:35,765
I know.
Let's rock-paper-scissors for it.

142
00:07:35,867 --> 00:07:38,961
- No! You would've-You would've won that, so-
- Oh.

143
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:43,268
George Michael- Buster, did you at least
offer your nephew a bowl of soup?

144
00:07:43,374 --> 00:07:45,342
Yes, Mother, I did.

145
00:07:45,443 --> 00:07:48,469
- Can I open a can of soup for you?
- Can it open a can?

146
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,174
- Can what open a can? Oh, God!
- Oh, God!

147
00:07:51,282 --> 00:07:54,376
Actually, I just wanted to spend some time
with my Knuckle Buster.

148
00:07:54,486 --> 00:07:58,752
- See, Mother? Not everybody is afraid of me.
- Oh, my God!

149
00:07:58,857 --> 00:08:03,385
<i>Aren't you the sweetest thing, spending
some time with what's left of your uncle.</i>

150
00:08:03,495 --> 00:08:07,556
I was supposed to go away to the Promise Land
this weekend, but my dad didn't want me to.

151
00:08:07,665 --> 00:08:10,657
- Family first.
- Well, you've done your duty this week.

152
00:08:10,768 --> 00:08:13,635
You're a very sympathetic
young man.

153
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,467
Very sympathetic.
You know what?

154
00:08:17,575 --> 00:08:21,204
You deserve to go out of town this weekend,
and I'm taking you.

155
00:08:21,312 --> 00:08:24,509
Really?
George Michael should have realized...

156
00:08:24,616 --> 00:08:27,414
<i>by the sailor suit
Lucille dressed him in...</i>

157
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:30,317
<i>that he wasn't going north
to the Promise Land.</i>

158
00:08:30,421 --> 00:08:34,323
I can't believe you don't know this song,
George Michael.

159
00:08:34,425 --> 00:08:37,917
No, he was going south.

160
00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:40,395
<i>- South to Motherboy.</i>

161
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,193
<i>And Michael and Gob headed out
to find the seal with the tracking device.</i>

162
00:08:48,304 --> 00:08:51,899
I guess we should call Buster
and have him meet us at the dock, right?

163
00:08:52,008 --> 00:08:54,374
I guess so.

164
00:08:56,212 --> 00:08:58,271
Or we could make sure
it's the right seal first?

165
00:08:58,381 --> 00:09:01,214
- I mean, why get his hopes up?
- Yeah, that's better.

166
00:09:01,317 --> 00:09:03,285
- Knock, knock.
- Oh, God!

167
00:09:03,386 --> 00:09:05,047
- Monster!
- Hey, Brothers.

168
00:09:05,154 --> 00:09:06,849
- Buster.
- Bonster!

169
00:09:06,956 --> 00:09:09,254
- Sorry about the window.
- Not a problem.

170
00:09:09,358 --> 00:09:14,853
I really hate this stupid hook.
But I certainly can't walk around like this.

171
00:09:14,964 --> 00:09:16,864
- Why not?
- Very handsome.

172
00:09:16,966 --> 00:09:20,732
We were just gonna call you.
We think we know where the seal is.

173
00:09:20,836 --> 00:09:22,804
- The seal that did this to me?
- Yeah.

174
00:09:22,905 --> 00:09:25,066
- Take me!
- Yes. That's a good idea.

175
00:09:25,174 --> 00:09:28,166
I'm gonna go with Barry.
You should get in here. I'll just go with Barry.

176
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:33,044
There's not enough room for you and me
and the stump and the thing- stuff. Barry!

177
00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:36,118
<i>Tobias had gotten his first speaking role...</i>

178
00:09:36,218 --> 00:09:40,086
<i>simply by signing away
the life rights of everyone he loved.</i>

179
00:09:40,189 --> 00:09:43,716
<i>- And now he needed some research.
- I'm George Sr.</i>

180
00:09:43,826 --> 00:09:46,954
Ooh, that's good.
That's the voice. I've got the voice.

181
00:09:47,063 --> 00:09:49,429
<i>- That's not my voice.
- Oh, my God!</i>

182
00:09:49,532 --> 00:09:52,433
- What are you doing here?
- I'm havin' a- tea party.

183
00:09:52,535 --> 00:09:57,472
What does it look like? I live here.
You tell anybody, you are dead.

184
00:09:57,573 --> 00:09:59,837
<i>Tobias saw the raw power of George Sr.</i>

185
00:09:59,942 --> 00:10:04,208
Stop licking my hand,
you horse's ass.

186
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:07,908
<i>Apower he needed
the man to teach him.
- That's it.</i>

187
00:10:08,017 --> 00:10:12,317
<i>So he explained the project,
and George Sr. Agreed on one condition.</i>

188
00:10:12,421 --> 00:10:14,389
If you play me,
you gotta play me like a man...

189
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:18,017
and not some mincing little
Polly or Nellie.

190
00:10:18,127 --> 00:10:22,086
I get those names confused.
Apologies. Apologies all around.

191
00:10:23,532 --> 00:10:26,000
<i>And the search
for Buster's hand continued.</i>

192
00:10:26,102 --> 00:10:28,434
I would love to be able
to say "Look what I've had reattached...

193
00:10:28,537 --> 00:10:31,404
while you and George Michael
were off to Motherboy."

194
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:33,771
Motherboy? Wait a minute.

195
00:10:33,876 --> 00:10:35,776
Mom took him to Motherboy?

196
00:10:35,878 --> 00:10:40,542
He couldn't wait to swoop in and throw on that
sailor suit, because he's not damaged goods.

197
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:42,447
Wait a minute.
I don't want him doing that.

198
00:10:42,551 --> 00:10:44,883
You gotta go with me down there
and help me get him, all right?

199
00:10:44,987 --> 00:10:48,252
- That place is your scene.
- Face it, Michael. They've won.

200
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:50,257
He's the new Buster.

201
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:53,487
<i>This was the worst thing
Michael could possibly hear.</i>

202
00:10:53,596 --> 00:10:58,056
Oh, I'm so sorry. False alarm.
What they tracked down was a shark...

203
00:10:58,167 --> 00:11:01,136
<i>and he must've bitten off the part of
the seal with the tracking device on it.</i>

204
00:11:01,237 --> 00:11:05,037
- Left flipper.
- So, the seal lost his hand too.

205
00:11:05,141 --> 00:11:07,632
Yeah, poor guy's probably out there
without a flipper...

206
00:11:07,743 --> 00:11:11,338
<i>swimming around in a circle,
freaking out his whole family.</i>

207
00:11:11,447 --> 00:11:14,075
That tracking device tells me
he was raised in captivity.

208
00:11:14,183 --> 00:11:18,415
<i>- There's no way he stood a chance
out in the real world.
- See that? He was a victim too.</i>

209
00:11:18,521 --> 00:11:22,048
<i>You both were too sheltered
to learn how to protect yourselves...</i>

210
00:11:22,158 --> 00:11:24,058
and we can't let that happen
to George Michael.

211
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,891
I will help you, Michael.
We've got to rescue your son.

212
00:11:27,997 --> 00:11:30,158
<i>And I've got to
staple this to a seal.</i>

213
00:11:30,266 --> 00:11:32,325
<i>And I've skipped breakfast,
so I'm off to Burger King.</i>

214
00:11:36,372 --> 00:11:40,638
<i>And Lucille arrived at
the hotel where Motherboy was taking place.</i>

215
00:11:40,743 --> 00:11:43,371
This is nice, spending some time,
just the two of us.

216
00:11:43,479 --> 00:11:47,210
Oh- me.
The exact same color.

217
00:11:47,316 --> 00:11:49,216
What are the odds?

218
00:11:49,318 --> 00:11:51,286
Not to worry.
Gangy brought some backups.

219
00:11:51,387 --> 00:11:53,287
We'll get a room
so we can change.

220
00:11:53,389 --> 00:11:56,290
You think enough time has passed
to do Sonny and Cher?

221
00:11:56,392 --> 00:11:58,417
<i>- Who?
- We're here for Motherboy.</i>

222
00:11:58,527 --> 00:12:00,927
And you do realize
this is not the band.

223
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,624
<i>Motherboy was also a heavy metal band...</i>

224
00:12:03,733 --> 00:12:06,725
<i>That used to rock
pretty hard in the '70s.</i>

225
00:12:06,836 --> 00:12:09,202
<i>We are legally obligated
to make the distinction.</i>

226
00:12:09,305 --> 00:12:11,296
Maybe I should let
my dad know that we're here.

227
00:12:11,407 --> 00:12:14,205
Oh, he'll know when we
bring home the trophy.

228
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:16,778
Yeah, but maybe
I'll just give him a call.

229
00:12:16,912 --> 00:12:20,245
<i>And what name shall we
put the room under?</i>

230
00:12:20,349 --> 00:12:23,318
<i>- Karmopolis.
- And Lindsay was about to see...</i>

231
00:12:23,419 --> 00:12:26,877
<i>a Tobias with
the raw power of George Sr.</i>

232
00:12:26,989 --> 00:12:28,889
I sort of want to talk
to you about some things.

233
00:12:28,991 --> 00:12:32,324
It's a little late for talk, Lindsay.
I'm a man of action now.

234
00:12:36,866 --> 00:12:39,892
You don't need the calories.

235
00:12:42,104 --> 00:12:44,436
This isn't working.

236
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:48,738
Is it my imagination, or is he more
commanding and mannish?

237
00:12:48,844 --> 00:12:52,007
It's like- I don't know.
Maybe I do want to be with him.

238
00:12:52,114 --> 00:12:54,582
Then you should go to him.
For as it is written...

239
00:12:54,683 --> 00:12:59,950
you shall be with whom you have formed
a more perfect union with under God.

240
00:13:00,055 --> 00:13:02,250
She's right.

241
00:13:02,358 --> 00:13:04,451
This isn't working.

242
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,619
I'm sorry.
You've got the wrong Motherboy.

243
00:13:06,729 --> 00:13:08,629
This looks like the place.

244
00:13:08,731 --> 00:13:10,824
<i>And Michael and Buster
arrived at Motherboy.</i>

245
00:13:10,933 --> 00:13:13,959
Excuse me.
Has a Lucille Bluth checked in?

246
00:13:14,069 --> 00:13:16,367
- I have no one by that name.
- God.

247
00:13:16,472 --> 00:13:18,702
- She knows you're after her.
- She does?

248
00:13:18,808 --> 00:13:21,436
Wait a minute.
I recognize those outfits.

249
00:13:21,544 --> 00:13:23,944
- We're getting you out of here.
- Thank you! Thank you!

250
00:13:24,046 --> 00:13:27,015
<i>- Oh, God! It's red.
- Take me with you! No, please! Please!</i>

251
00:13:27,116 --> 00:13:29,084
- It's the wrong child.
- Where do we go next?

252
00:13:29,185 --> 00:13:33,417
I will tell you this, Michael. If Mother saw
those two, she is going to change clothes.

253
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:35,422
And that means
he'll be on the balcony.

254
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:39,221
Whenever she changed clothes,
she made me wait on the balcony until zip-up.

255
00:13:39,328 --> 00:13:41,558
And yet, anything goes at bath time.

256
00:13:41,664 --> 00:13:44,292
Let's check the balconies.

257
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,960
<i>And Barry prepared Gob
to meet with his wife.</i>

258
00:13:47,069 --> 00:13:49,196
If you really want
to settle this, your job...

259
00:13:49,305 --> 00:13:51,239
is to convince
that "wife" of yours...

260
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:54,969
<i>that you are willing to go in front of thejudge
and admit that you never had sex.</i>

261
00:13:55,077 --> 00:13:58,945
She has a name, Barry. You don't happen
to know what it is by the way, do you?

262
00:13:59,048 --> 00:14:02,176
<i>That's why I want to settle.
I'm not super prepared.</i>

263
00:14:02,284 --> 00:14:05,913
Well, we did have sex.
And I'm not a great liar.

264
00:14:06,021 --> 00:14:08,046
<i>Both things hejust said were lies.</i>

265
00:14:08,157 --> 00:14:11,058
- But if you think it'll scare her off.
- I do, and it will.

266
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,596
And you don't want to go in front of
that judge. I caught him in a drag club.

267
00:14:14,697 --> 00:14:18,861
- What were you doin' there?
- Wow. You should be the lawyer.

268
00:14:23,873 --> 00:14:26,273
<i>And soon, Michael and Buster
surveyed the hotel...</i>

269
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:28,275
<i>Iooking for George Michael.</i>

270
00:14:28,377 --> 00:14:31,141
There's a very bored-looking little
Sonny Bono on that balcony.

271
00:14:31,247 --> 00:14:33,875
<i>Oh, God. That means
she'll be dressed like Cher.</i>

272
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:37,680
I have an idea.

273
00:14:37,786 --> 00:14:42,223
It is time I used something I trained for in army,
but I never got a chance to do.

274
00:14:42,324 --> 00:14:46,021
<i>- You cannot zip-line over there!
- Either I zip down or he zips up!</i>

275
00:14:46,128 --> 00:14:48,426
And that is a mighty long zipper
on Mother's Cher jumpsuit.

276
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:50,964
You have to get on
your knees to start it.

277
00:14:51,066 --> 00:14:53,557
This is much less scary.
Godspeed, Buster.

278
00:14:58,974 --> 00:15:01,772
One, two, three-

279
00:15:01,877 --> 00:15:04,471
You came for me!

280
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,605
<i>Zip me up.</i>

281
00:15:13,589 --> 00:15:17,116
We're switching rooms again.
And costumes.

282
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:22,964
<i>Tobias had begun work
on the set of Scandal Makers.</i>

283
00:15:23,066 --> 00:15:26,627
<i>What's so great about Tobias is he's got this
obligation to his wife and daughter.</i>

284
00:15:26,736 --> 00:15:29,296
- Whoa. This guy's straight?
- Yeah.

285
00:15:29,406 --> 00:15:32,432
Then what the hell am I wearin' these for?
Look at that.

286
00:15:32,542 --> 00:15:35,102
Hey, gang. I'm sorry.
I don't want to note you to death...

287
00:15:35,211 --> 00:15:37,975
but you should be wearing those
under your pants.

288
00:15:38,081 --> 00:15:41,812
- Why?
- It's a thing. There's dozens of us.

289
00:15:41,918 --> 00:15:44,113
This whole thing is startin' to feel
like a real career killer.

290
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,120
- Yeah, I know, man.
- Also, l-

291
00:15:46,222 --> 00:15:49,157
Tobias, why don't you go learn
your lines, man? Work on them.

292
00:15:49,259 --> 00:15:51,591
Did I get lines? God!

293
00:15:51,695 --> 00:15:53,629
They told me I was just jumping
onto a moving stair car.

294
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:56,756
If that man's straight,
then I am sober.

295
00:15:56,866 --> 00:15:59,494
Hi. Um, I'm waiting
for "Gawb" Bluth.

296
00:15:59,602 --> 00:16:01,797
I'm Gob Bluth.
My wife send you?

297
00:16:01,905 --> 00:16:04,373
- I'm your wife.
- I knew that.

298
00:16:04,474 --> 00:16:07,602
Nice to see you again, Usarmy.

299
00:16:07,711 --> 00:16:11,442
You lost a lot of weight in Iraq,
especially up in the northern region.

300
00:16:11,548 --> 00:16:14,676
- So where's the seal?
- Hey, that's not my problem.

301
00:16:14,784 --> 00:16:17,275
As far as I'm concerned,
we were never even married.

302
00:16:17,387 --> 00:16:20,322
<i>Maybe I'll just say that
we never sealed the deal.</i>

303
00:16:20,423 --> 00:16:23,449
- You're willing to admit that?
- Lie about it? Yes.

304
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,461
<i>Wow. I mis-underestimated you.</i>

305
00:16:26,563 --> 00:16:30,465
You've got some courage.
Makes me wonder what I'm missing.

306
00:16:30,567 --> 00:16:32,535
You mean, other than your cans?

307
00:16:32,635 --> 00:16:35,195
No. They're still here.

308
00:16:35,305 --> 00:16:37,899
<i>And so Gob set about consummating...</i>

309
00:16:38,008 --> 00:16:40,977
<i>the marriage he'd finally agreed
to claim he hadn't.</i>

310
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:48,540
<i>And back at Motherboy XXX, Lucille
was finding her new partner an asset.</i>

311
00:16:48,651 --> 00:16:51,745
- Is this your son?
- No, I'm his grandmother.

312
00:16:51,855 --> 00:16:53,846
- He's an orphan.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

313
00:16:53,957 --> 00:16:57,358
- Well, you guys should win.
- I'm not an orphan. I have a dad.

314
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,758
Well, good luck to you.

315
00:17:02,532 --> 00:17:04,830
Well, that little bit
of honesty helped nothing.

316
00:17:04,934 --> 00:17:07,835
You'd better bring it
to the waltz, young man.

317
00:17:07,937 --> 00:17:11,771
<i>Meanwhile, Michael and Buster
had retrieved Buster's hook...</i>

318
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:14,241
<i>and were staking out
the situation.</i>

319
00:17:14,344 --> 00:17:17,336
<i>Gypsies.</i>

320
00:17:17,447 --> 00:17:20,507
Hey.

321
00:17:20,617 --> 00:17:23,848
They've changed into gypsies.
My army training...

322
00:17:23,953 --> 00:17:28,390
tells me that this is
going to be a hot mission.

323
00:17:28,491 --> 00:17:30,959
- One hot mission.
- Yes.

324
00:17:31,061 --> 00:17:34,519
I create a diversion, and you grab
George Michael and go.

325
00:17:34,631 --> 00:17:37,498
We need a name.

326
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,559
Maybe "Operation Hot Mother."

327
00:17:41,671 --> 00:17:45,903
<i>- No, let's try to top that.
- They never did.</i>

328
00:17:46,009 --> 00:17:49,103
<i>And later, Operation Hot Mother was underway.</i>

329
00:17:49,212 --> 00:17:52,875
<i>Buster was waiting for Michael's cue
to unplug the lights.</i>

330
00:17:52,982 --> 00:17:56,440
<i>But that's when Buster
caught his hook on a sandbag.</i>

331
00:17:56,553 --> 00:17:59,386
Hey!

332
00:18:01,157 --> 00:18:05,491
<i>And now from the land of gypsies,
Lucille Bluth and her orphaned grandson.</i>

333
00:18:05,628 --> 00:18:07,493
What the hell's goin' on, Buster?
Cut the lights!

334
00:18:12,001 --> 00:18:15,300
- Buster?
- Grab him! Take the gypsy boy!

335
00:18:15,405 --> 00:18:18,135
- I'm taking you out of here. Let's go.
- They haven't served dinner yet.

336
00:18:18,241 --> 00:18:19,970
- George Michael.
- You're not taking him.

337
00:18:20,076 --> 00:18:22,943
- Take me with you!
- What are you doin'? I can't.

338
00:18:23,046 --> 00:18:25,310
<i>Get off of me!
Buster, let's get out of here.</i>

339
00:18:25,415 --> 00:18:28,907
I'm stuck. Go.
Take the boy. Go!

340
00:18:29,018 --> 00:18:31,646
<i>All right, Motherboys.
Our curtain seems to be stuck.</i>

341
00:18:31,754 --> 00:18:35,656
We're going to do some freestyle
waltzing while we get it fixed.

342
00:18:35,758 --> 00:18:38,352
Boys' choice.

343
00:18:38,461 --> 00:18:41,294
<i>- George Michael, you're choosing me.
- No, Mom.</i>

344
00:18:41,397 --> 00:18:44,366
You had no right to bring him to this freak show.
He was supposed to be visiting Buster.

345
00:18:44,467 --> 00:18:46,367
No, you were supposed
to be visiting Buster...

346
00:18:46,469 --> 00:18:48,994
but you made your son do it
because you didn't want to.

347
00:18:49,105 --> 00:18:51,096
- You were supposed to do it?
- You didn't want to?

348
00:18:51,207 --> 00:18:55,940
No. Buster, l- I didn't know how
to, uh, treat you, all right?

349
00:18:56,045 --> 00:18:58,980
I thought that you would be a little
different, but you're not.

350
00:18:59,082 --> 00:19:01,482
I was wrong, okay?
I'm sorry.

351
00:19:01,584 --> 00:19:05,611
You know, you're as good a brother
as you ever were.

352
00:19:05,722 --> 00:19:08,816
- Thank you.
- All right?

353
00:19:08,925 --> 00:19:12,190
Yes. I am no different.
I am the same old Motherboy.

354
00:19:12,295 --> 00:19:15,526
George Michael still has a chance.
Take him!

355
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,225
Thanks. Let's go.

356
00:19:20,336 --> 00:19:22,964
Boys' choice?

357
00:19:23,072 --> 00:19:28,009
That is, if you're not embarrassed
to take my hook.

358
00:19:28,111 --> 00:19:30,170
Of course not.

359
00:19:33,316 --> 00:19:36,547
I'm Peter Pan,
and you're Captain Hook.

360
00:19:36,653 --> 00:19:40,987
We'll pretend it's a costume.
Let's dance.

361
00:19:45,662 --> 00:19:48,597
<i>And that night, Michael,
his brother and his son...</i>

362
00:19:48,698 --> 00:19:51,098
<i>- arrived at the Promise Land.
- All right.</i>

363
00:19:51,201 --> 00:19:53,328
I appreciate you taking me
up here to see Ann.

364
00:19:53,436 --> 00:19:55,768
- A promise is a promise.
And I'm glad the three of us...
- Yeah.

365
00:19:55,872 --> 00:19:58,500
- Were able to spend some time together.
- Oh, yeah.

366
00:19:58,608 --> 00:20:04,069
<i>- And I finally feel good about myself. "Saddest."
- And I saw some of those people.</i>

367
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:07,047
- That was a very competitive category.
- Oh, don't I know it.

368
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:09,050
- Here we go.
- I can't get out, actually.

369
00:20:09,152 --> 00:20:11,916
<i>On the next Arrested Development.</i>

370
00:20:12,021 --> 00:20:16,185
<i>Lindsay finds herself strangely compelled
to be with Tobias.</i>

371
00:20:16,292 --> 00:20:19,022
I have never
been more attracted to you.

372
00:20:19,128 --> 00:20:21,062
Wow. The service
sent you over fast.

373
00:20:21,164 --> 00:20:23,792
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.
I'm in the wrong trailer.

374
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,800
<i>But not the one she's married to.</i>

375
00:20:25,902 --> 00:20:28,894
So you don't cry
when you take those off?

376
00:20:29,005 --> 00:20:32,168
<i>Having finally had sex, Gob can admit...</i>

377
00:20:32,275 --> 00:20:34,470
<i>he never consummated
their marriage.</i>

378
00:20:34,577 --> 00:20:39,708
Judge, maybe you should take a look at this.
It was taken in your office just moments ago.

379
00:20:39,816 --> 00:20:42,910
<i>- But Gob catches a lucky break.
- There's no way to tell who this man is.</i>

380
00:20:43,019 --> 00:20:45,044
<i>But it doesn't last long.</i>

381
00:20:45,154 --> 00:20:47,554
That's me, Your Honor.
L- my wife.

382
00:20:47,657 --> 00:20:50,990
<i>We really lost this case.</i>

383
00:20:51,094 --> 00:20:53,961
<i>And Maeby impresses
the kids at the Promise Land...</i>

384
00:20:54,063 --> 00:20:56,930
<i>with her one
scary campfire story.</i>

385
00:20:57,033 --> 00:21:00,230
Knock, scrape.
The only thing more terrifying...

386
00:21:00,336 --> 00:21:03,601
<i>than the escaped lunatic's hook
was his twisted call!</i>

387
00:21:03,706 --> 00:21:06,607
Hey, campers.

388
00:21:10,713 --> 00:21:13,739
I'm a monster!

389
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:15,818
This may have been
a step backwards.

390
00:21:23,926 --> 00:21:29,330
<i>Upon her knee</i>

391
00:21:29,432 --> 00:21:33,835
<i>So fine to be</i>

392
00:21:33,936 --> 00:21:39,841
<i>Mother and boy</i>

393
00:21:39,942 --> 00:21:44,845
<i>Mother-</i>

394
00:21:44,947 --> 00:21:47,848
<i>...boy</i>
