1
00:00:01,014 --> 00:00:04,415
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:04,517 --> 00:00:06,508
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:06,619 --> 00:00:08,610
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:14,127 --> 00:00:15,890
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

5
00:00:19,899 --> 00:00:22,629
<i>Michael came home
to find his brother-in-law Tobias...</i>

6
00:00:22,735 --> 00:00:26,398
<i>- who'd been kicked out of
the house earlier that week.
- How are you?</i>

7
00:00:26,506 --> 00:00:28,406
Good.

8
00:00:28,508 --> 00:00:31,306
- Didn't I already see you today?
- Not that I know of.

9
00:00:31,411 --> 00:00:34,812
<i>Michael had seen him earlier that day...</i>

10
00:00:34,914 --> 00:00:37,906
<i>as Tobias had been posing as an English
nanny named Mrs. Featherbottom.</i>

11
00:00:38,017 --> 00:00:40,451
Who'd like a banger
in the mouth?

12
00:00:40,553 --> 00:00:45,786
Oh, right. I forgot. Here in the States
you call it a sausage in the mouth.

13
00:00:45,892 --> 00:00:49,988
<i>We just call it a sausage.
- The family,
of course, knew it was Tobias...</i>

14
00:00:50,096 --> 00:00:51,620
<i>but the house had
never been cleaner.</i>

15
00:00:51,731 --> 00:00:54,393
Hello, young lady.
I haven't seen you in a week.

16
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,901
<i>Oh. Right. That means
Mrs. Featherbottom isn't here.</i>

17
00:00:58,004 --> 00:01:00,598
Which means she didn't iron
my blouse...

18
00:01:00,706 --> 00:01:04,164
which means I don't have
anything to wear for my premiere.

19
00:01:04,277 --> 00:01:07,178
<i>The premier-
of Canada.</i>

20
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,646
He's going out
with my gym teacher.

21
00:01:09,749 --> 00:01:12,240
<i>Maeby was actually
referring to the premiere of a film...</i>

22
00:01:12,351 --> 00:01:15,411
<i>from the studio
where she had conned her way into a job.</i>

23
00:01:15,521 --> 00:01:17,682
Hey, Jeff. Did you get
a chance to do coverage on...

24
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,690
<i>History In Prespective?</i>

25
00:01:19,792 --> 00:01:23,250
Yeah. I looked that up.
It's a ninth grade history textbook.

26
00:01:23,362 --> 00:01:27,799
Yeah. And if I don't get your report on it,
I won't be able to pass.

27
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,859
On it.
Because I have a feeling it's a piece of-

28
00:01:31,971 --> 00:01:34,940
<i>Unfortunately, thejob was
wreaking havoc with her language.</i>

29
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:37,305
Maybe we just need a new-
housekeeper.

30
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:39,571
<i>Okay. I'm sure she would
have ironed it for you...</i>

31
00:01:39,679 --> 00:01:42,807
had you told her about it before
she changed out of her bloody work clothes.

32
00:01:42,915 --> 00:01:45,782
<i>But I am off then.</i>

33
00:01:48,387 --> 00:01:51,117
I gotta keep him trying. That is the job.

34
00:01:53,826 --> 00:01:55,794
Michael, what are you
doing tomorrow?

35
00:01:55,895 --> 00:01:59,126
Having my day ruined with
whatever you're about to ask me to do.

36
00:01:59,232 --> 00:02:03,134
It's my wedding anniversary,
and Oscar wants to throw me a party.

37
00:02:03,236 --> 00:02:05,864
He is aware that
he's not married to you, right?

38
00:02:05,972 --> 00:02:09,806
<i>In fact, Oscar had started to perceive
that Lucille was pulling away from him.</i>

39
00:02:09,909 --> 00:02:13,310
Not now.
It's my time of the month.

40
00:02:13,412 --> 00:02:18,145
Not now. I don't want to risk
having a baby. It could kill me.

41
00:02:18,251 --> 00:02:21,516
<i>- So he went to Buster for advice.
- I think she misses my brother.</i>

42
00:02:21,621 --> 00:02:24,818
- My father?
- Yes? I mean, yes.

43
00:02:24,924 --> 00:02:28,087
- Maybe I should throw her an anniversary party.
- Oh.

44
00:02:28,194 --> 00:02:31,994
So when he doesn't show, she'll realize that
you were the one who was always there for us.

45
00:02:32,098 --> 00:02:34,726
Well, I was thinking one more party,
and then I'd move out.

46
00:02:34,834 --> 00:02:36,927
But no.
I like your plan better.

47
00:02:37,036 --> 00:02:39,903
The only problem is we know he's-
he's around somewhere.

48
00:02:40,006 --> 00:02:42,167
Well, he didn't return
when I lost my hand.

49
00:02:42,275 --> 00:02:45,108
But you-
you not only embrace it...

50
00:02:45,211 --> 00:02:48,339
but I saw you kissing it
while you thought I was sleeping.

51
00:02:53,853 --> 00:02:57,186
<i>Who knows what goes on in
that pot-addled mind ofhis.</i>

52
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:00,748
Anyway, it's a party,
and I want the whole family there.

53
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,090
- We're havin' a party?
- No.

54
00:03:03,196 --> 00:03:07,860
<i>Well, I'm sorry if I don't want you
doing one of your stupid puppet shows.</i>

55
00:03:07,967 --> 00:03:11,926
I did that once, Mom.
And a lot of people thought it was pretty cool.

56
00:03:12,038 --> 00:03:14,097
<i>In an effort to hip up his act...</i>

57
00:03:14,207 --> 00:03:16,368
<i>Gob had briefly
introduced a puppet.</i>

58
00:03:16,475 --> 00:03:19,376
- Can I tell you somethin', my man?
- Sure, Franklin.

59
00:03:19,478 --> 00:03:23,608
<i>You are one cool-</i>

60
00:03:23,716 --> 00:03:28,585
Speakin' of mothers,
let me give that oatmeal some brown sugar.

61
00:03:28,688 --> 00:03:32,089
- Get off my wife, you bastard!
- Oh, man. What's the matter with you?

62
00:03:32,191 --> 00:03:34,159
Franklin said some things
Whitey wasn't ready to hear.

63
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,219
Gob, weren't you also mercilessly beaten
outside of a club in Torrance for that act?

64
00:03:38,331 --> 00:03:41,596
He also said some things that
African-Americany wasn't ready to hear either.

65
00:03:41,701 --> 00:03:43,896
You know, Mom,
we have no idea where Dad is.

66
00:03:44,003 --> 00:03:45,903
How's he gonna
hear about the party?

67
00:03:46,005 --> 00:03:48,496
Why do you have
the baby monitor out?

68
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:51,736
- I'm, uh, listening in-
- She wants her man back.

69
00:03:51,844 --> 00:03:55,109
- On my son.
- Yo, man. You're gonna get your
sorry white ass thrown in jail.

70
00:03:55,214 --> 00:03:58,149
I said that's enough.

71
00:03:58,251 --> 00:04:01,277
<i>Michael came up with an excuse
he knew his mother would understand.</i>

72
00:04:01,387 --> 00:04:03,753
I'm listening in on my son.

73
00:04:03,856 --> 00:04:06,450
I'm a little worried
about his girlfriend, Ann.

74
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:09,255
<i>My advice, get one of those teddy bears
with the cameras in them.</i>

75
00:04:09,362 --> 00:04:13,355
I had one in Buster's room to make sure
he wasn't getting too serious with anyone.

76
00:04:13,466 --> 00:04:17,493
As it turned out,
he got too serious with the teddy bear.

77
00:04:17,603 --> 00:04:22,040
I'll see you
at the anniversary party.

78
00:04:22,141 --> 00:04:24,632
- Gangy's having an anniversary party?
- Seems that way.

79
00:04:24,744 --> 00:04:28,202
- Is Franklin gonna be there?
- See that, Mike? Kids love Franklin.

80
00:04:28,314 --> 00:04:31,340
I just don't want him to point out
my cracker ass in front of Ann.

81
00:04:33,486 --> 00:04:35,454
Imagine what he'd say
about her.

82
00:04:35,554 --> 00:04:38,648
<i>So you were listening in
on George Michael.</i>

83
00:04:38,758 --> 00:04:41,192
Can you believe
what he asked me this morning?

84
00:04:41,294 --> 00:04:43,626
Do you think my mom's
engagement ring is still around?

85
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:47,563
Of course it is. Your father would never
part with something so precious.

86
00:04:47,667 --> 00:04:52,468
<i>In fact, Lindsay was currently
wearing it on her middle toe, roast beef.</i>

87
00:04:52,571 --> 00:04:54,869
I'm thinking of asking Ann
to get pre-engaged.

88
00:04:54,974 --> 00:04:59,035
- You are?
- Yeah. I feel like God moved her
here from Ohio to be with me.

89
00:04:59,145 --> 00:05:02,308
<i>- Her?
- Well, that's the first I've heard of this.</i>

90
00:05:02,415 --> 00:05:05,851
- Well, then who said "Her?"
- Me. That was-That was me.

91
00:05:05,951 --> 00:05:08,511
But, um, her?

92
00:05:08,621 --> 00:05:10,987
Look, it's just a pre-engagement.
It's exciting.

93
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:12,717
You know,
it's young love.

94
00:05:12,825 --> 00:05:15,760
I had it once.
A man I loved-

95
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:21,025
- Here's young Maeby's blouse.
- And then things took a turn somehow.

96
00:05:21,133 --> 00:05:24,830
<i>Master Bluth.
I haven't seen you in a week's time.</i>

97
00:05:24,937 --> 00:05:27,997
Actually, you tried to put a banger
in my mouth this morning.

98
00:05:28,107 --> 00:05:31,474
Oh, was it this morn-
Well, I'm sorry.

99
00:05:31,577 --> 00:05:35,343
- I'm just so exhausted.
- So I'm just gonna talk to my son.

100
00:05:35,448 --> 00:05:38,508
I'm gonna tell him that I'm against this.
I don't like her.

101
00:05:38,617 --> 00:05:41,586
You know, maybe if you
stop judging her, he'd trust you.

102
00:05:41,687 --> 00:05:45,623
Look, if you say no,
you're just gonna drive him right to her.

103
00:05:45,725 --> 00:05:47,955
<i>Hey, Dad.
Can you drive me to Ann's?</i>

104
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,358
N-N-N-

105
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:54,058
- Y-Yes.
- Great. I'll wait in the car.

106
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:56,464
I don't think that worked.

107
00:05:56,569 --> 00:06:01,700
<i>Meanwhile, Gob went to check on
the one friend who didn't mind having him around.</i>

108
00:06:01,807 --> 00:06:04,640
<i>Get your loser hand out of my ass.</i>

109
00:06:04,744 --> 00:06:07,372
- Hello, Son.
- Oh, Dad. I thought- Dad?

110
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,506
This is where you've been hi- Michael.

111
00:06:10,616 --> 00:06:12,584
I just came back
because of your mother.

112
00:06:12,685 --> 00:06:15,210
She's with my brother
on my anniversary.

113
00:06:15,321 --> 00:06:17,221
But I got an idea
from George Michael.

114
00:06:17,323 --> 00:06:19,257
I need to recommit myself
to your mother.

115
00:06:19,358 --> 00:06:22,259
- Her?
- But you gotta get me into that party.

116
00:06:22,361 --> 00:06:24,295
Then you gotta
take me to this church.

117
00:06:24,397 --> 00:06:26,524
I found this brochure
that Ann left behind.

118
00:06:26,632 --> 00:06:29,100
That's gonna be tough.
I'm not really all that invited.

119
00:06:29,201 --> 00:06:31,635
I got it all worked out,
but I need a limousine.

120
00:06:31,737 --> 00:06:34,262
L- I can do this, Dad.
I'm gonna make you proud.

121
00:06:34,373 --> 00:06:36,739
Never too late to start.

122
00:06:36,842 --> 00:06:42,075
<i>And Michael drove to Ann's house,
where he finally got to meet Ann's parents.</i>

123
00:06:42,181 --> 00:06:44,809
This is my father,
Pastor Terry Veal.

124
00:06:44,917 --> 00:06:48,409
- Hello.
- Oh, Pastor. I didn't know. You didn't tell me.

125
00:06:48,521 --> 00:06:50,421
- I told you.
- No, you didn't.

126
00:06:50,523 --> 00:06:53,117
People treat you so differently
when they find out you're a man of God.

127
00:06:53,225 --> 00:06:56,786
- Oh, believe me, I know.
- Oh, are you a churchgoing man?

128
00:06:56,896 --> 00:06:58,625
I am.

129
00:06:58,731 --> 00:07:01,666
Sometimes. Yes.
I don't go religiously.

130
00:07:01,767 --> 00:07:03,792
I mean,
I'm not a nut about it.

131
00:07:03,903 --> 00:07:08,203
Because there is no such thing
as a nut when it comes to religion, Pastor.

132
00:07:08,307 --> 00:07:10,639
I've met a few.

133
00:07:10,743 --> 00:07:13,541
I'm sure if you look a bit closer
you'll find some very earnest people...

134
00:07:13,646 --> 00:07:15,546
that are just
doing their best.

135
00:07:15,648 --> 00:07:17,548
<i>- What are you doin', Dad?
- I'm not sure.</i>

136
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:21,518
Why don't you kids run along and let us
get to know each other a bit better? Thank you.

137
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,111
- Maybe I should get my wife. Honey.
- Okay.

138
00:07:24,223 --> 00:07:26,123
<i>This is George Michael's father.</i>

139
00:07:26,225 --> 00:07:29,456
<i>This is your wife.
Didn't- Didn't realize you could remarry.</i>

140
00:07:29,562 --> 00:07:32,690
- What?
- Is this Ann's mother?

141
00:07:32,798 --> 00:07:34,959
- I'm Mrs. Veal.
- I'm sorry. I just-

142
00:07:35,067 --> 00:07:37,399
I did not expect
somebody so young.

143
00:07:37,503 --> 00:07:40,131
Next you're gonna say
how Ann and I can be sisters.

144
00:07:40,239 --> 00:07:42,503
No, I'd never say that.

145
00:07:42,608 --> 00:07:44,303
Listen, I'm here because...

146
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:48,073
I think my son might be planning on
asking your daughter to get pre-engaged.

147
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,341
<i>- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, my gosh.</i>

148
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:52,974
Well, that is something
to celebrate.

149
00:07:53,085 --> 00:07:55,576
Can we open up
some sparkling apple cider?

150
00:07:55,688 --> 00:07:58,657
- No.
- Oh, did you want us to
go down to the liquor store...

151
00:07:58,757 --> 00:08:00,657
and get you some liquor?

152
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:02,818
No. Don't you think
they're a bit too young?

153
00:08:02,928 --> 00:08:04,657
Oh, we got serious
around his age.

154
00:08:04,763 --> 00:08:06,856
Who can blame you?
You gotta lock that down.

155
00:08:06,966 --> 00:08:09,161
But I'm not quite sure
that they're ready.

156
00:08:09,268 --> 00:08:12,237
Michael, in my experience,
there is no recipe for a perfect match.

157
00:08:12,338 --> 00:08:14,602
<i>It takes the love
of two families.</i>

158
00:08:14,707 --> 00:08:16,868
Well, you haven't met
my family.

159
00:08:16,976 --> 00:08:20,878
<i>And that's when Michael devised
a new plan to win the Veals'disapproval.</i>

160
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,414
You haven't met my family.

161
00:08:23,516 --> 00:08:25,541
You should meet my family.

162
00:08:25,651 --> 00:08:27,744
We're gonna be having
an anniversary party.

163
00:08:27,853 --> 00:08:29,878
What a wonderful surprise.

164
00:08:29,989 --> 00:08:32,924
We would love to witness
a celebration of their love.

165
00:08:33,025 --> 00:08:34,993
That would be
a wonderful surprise.

166
00:08:35,094 --> 00:08:37,289
<i>But he did want a little bit of insurance.</i>

167
00:08:37,396 --> 00:08:42,095
Hey, Gob.
Mom wants Franklin at the party.

168
00:08:42,201 --> 00:08:44,635
Yeah. What?

169
00:08:44,737 --> 00:08:48,070
No, no, no. I don't want to talk-
Hey, Franklin.

170
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:55,469
<i>Lucille was setting up for the anniversary party...</i>

171
00:08:55,574 --> 00:08:57,735
<i>that she didn't expect
her husband to attend.</i>

172
00:08:57,843 --> 00:09:00,539
<i>- Where's the food?
- Sorry. Just stuffing the mushroom.</i>

173
00:09:00,646 --> 00:09:03,979
<i>You realize that's Tobias,
don't you?</i>

174
00:09:04,082 --> 00:09:06,482
If he's gonna raid my closet,
he's gonna work for it.

175
00:09:06,585 --> 00:09:10,214
<i>- What happened to his ankle?
- Tobias had attempted an entrance...</i>

176
00:09:10,322 --> 00:09:12,222
<i>that he hoped
would enchant his daughter.</i>

177
00:09:14,393 --> 00:09:17,385
Ohhhh!

178
00:09:17,496 --> 00:09:20,829
We shan't be telling
your mother this, shan't we?

179
00:09:20,933 --> 00:09:25,131
Maybe you can point out to your mother
that your father hasn't arrived yet.

180
00:09:26,171 --> 00:09:30,267
Hmm. So, my father's
not here.

181
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:33,139
Maybe he is.

182
00:09:36,548 --> 00:09:40,006
Ann just called. They had a predawn mass,
and then they're gonna go to mass, so-

183
00:09:40,118 --> 00:09:43,087
Well, Ann's got
a great deal of mass.

184
00:09:43,188 --> 00:09:46,157
Anyway, I hope
that the Veals like us.

185
00:09:46,258 --> 00:09:48,317
Why don't you go top off
your Gangy? Thanks.

186
00:09:48,427 --> 00:09:50,452
Wait a minute.
You invited the Veals?

187
00:09:50,562 --> 00:09:52,792
Only so that they'll
disapprove of us.

188
00:09:52,898 --> 00:09:55,093
I gotta kill this
pre-engagement somehow.

189
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,760
And after Mom's second vodka,
and after Buster's second juice box...

190
00:09:57,869 --> 00:10:00,099
they're gonna forbid Ann
from even seeing my son...

191
00:10:00,205 --> 00:10:03,174
much less taking his ring,
and I'm still the good guy.

192
00:10:03,275 --> 00:10:07,336
So the devout religious family-
they're the bad guys?

193
00:10:07,446 --> 00:10:09,505
You'll understand when Maeby
starts getting proposals.

194
00:10:09,615 --> 00:10:12,175
<i>Actually, Maeby had given two that day.</i>

195
00:10:12,284 --> 00:10:14,616
<i>I'm sorry. I can't read
what you wrote on this buck slip.</i>

196
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,881
You've got the handwriting
of a 15-year-old.

197
00:10:16,989 --> 00:10:19,287
Fifteen-year-old.
Marry me!

198
00:10:21,426 --> 00:10:24,395
Hey, I'm almost done with that coverage.
I can bring it to you tonight.

199
00:10:24,496 --> 00:10:26,396
Are you still
at the Balboa Towers?

200
00:10:26,498 --> 00:10:29,126
<i>Maeby had used her grandmother's address...</i>

201
00:10:29,234 --> 00:10:31,134
<i>so as not to arouse
suspicion at home.</i>

202
00:10:31,236 --> 00:10:34,501
<i>This required convincing the guard
she was several years younger than her age.</i>

203
00:10:34,606 --> 00:10:37,507
Boy, you get a lot of mail
from that movie studio.

204
00:10:37,609 --> 00:10:40,043
I write a lot of letters
to movie stars.

205
00:10:40,145 --> 00:10:42,978
- You seem a little old for that.
- Babysit me.

206
00:10:43,081 --> 00:10:45,709
<i>That place seems
so old for you.</i>

207
00:10:45,817 --> 00:10:47,751
I'll send Dr. Epstein
your compliments.

208
00:10:47,853 --> 00:10:50,344
- And may I add, marry me.
- Okay.

209
00:10:50,455 --> 00:10:54,084
<i>And Maeby realized
she might be in need of a new deflection.</i>

210
00:10:54,192 --> 00:10:56,717
<i>Hi, Mrs. Veal. Welcome.</i>

211
00:10:56,828 --> 00:10:58,853
Mom, this is Ann's mother.

212
00:10:58,964 --> 00:11:00,864
Are you sure
this isn't her sister?

213
00:11:00,966 --> 00:11:04,561
- What a lovely thing to say.
- That's an awful thing to say, Mom. Please.

214
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,570
I'm so eager
to meet your husband.

215
00:11:06,672 --> 00:11:10,506
Yeah. Dad escaped from prison.
Did you not know that?

216
00:11:10,609 --> 00:11:14,170
<i>In fact, George Sr. Had
just been picked up by his son.</i>

217
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:18,010
Oh, great. It's stuck. All right.
Just stay down and let me handle this.

218
00:11:19,184 --> 00:11:21,084
Is that Mr. Bluth there?

219
00:11:21,186 --> 00:11:23,211
He's got us, Dad.
Come on out.

220
00:11:23,321 --> 00:11:25,915
<i>He's talking to you,
you idiot. Cover.</i>

221
00:11:26,024 --> 00:11:28,015
I ain't your daddy!

222
00:11:28,126 --> 00:11:31,220
How's it goin', brother?

223
00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:34,560
You want to pop the trunk
and roll the windows down, please?

224
00:11:39,504 --> 00:11:42,632
I'm just messin' with you. Hey, Franklin.
How you doin', little man?

225
00:11:46,178 --> 00:11:48,271
So I'm afraid Ann's
with my husband.

226
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,439
He had a last-minute
vow renewal at the chapel.

227
00:11:50,549 --> 00:11:53,484
<i>A call that was made by George Sr.</i>

228
00:11:53,585 --> 00:11:56,213
How do we get her to the church?
Tell her you're in here?

229
00:11:56,321 --> 00:11:58,915
No. Cover her eyes
and take her to the limo.

230
00:11:59,024 --> 00:12:02,790
No. Bring her in here, knock her out with this
ether, and you stuff her into this garment bag.

231
00:12:02,894 --> 00:12:06,125
Anyone sees, you do the same.
Oh, hi, Tobias.

232
00:12:06,231 --> 00:12:08,131
Oh.

233
00:12:08,233 --> 00:12:11,725
Whenever I get a wee bit scared
I hum a little tune

234
00:12:11,837 --> 00:12:13,737
Hum diddle diddly
Hum di-do

235
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,501
You put a handkerchief over her mouth
for a couple of seconds.

236
00:12:16,608 --> 00:12:18,633
No more than two though.
'Cause you could kill her.

237
00:12:18,744 --> 00:12:20,302
- I don't have a handkerchief.
- Fine.

238
00:12:20,412 --> 00:12:23,813
Put the ether on the puppet's lips.
Have the puppet kiss her.

239
00:12:23,915 --> 00:12:25,906
I ain't kissin'
that old bitch.

240
00:12:26,017 --> 00:12:28,076
That's my wife, you bastard!

241
00:12:28,186 --> 00:12:30,177
Dad, that's my wrist!

242
00:12:30,288 --> 00:12:33,587
Hey, man! That's his neck!

243
00:12:33,692 --> 00:12:36,855
Hey, Gob. Mrs. Veal,
this is my brother Gob.

244
00:12:36,962 --> 00:12:39,453
- Where's your pal Franklin?
- Throat's a little sore.

245
00:12:39,564 --> 00:12:42,032
And wrist.
Nice to meet you.

246
00:12:42,134 --> 00:12:44,159
What a lovely family.

247
00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:46,703
Does it seem that way?
Where's Buster?

248
00:12:46,805 --> 00:12:48,773
Should help.

249
00:12:48,874 --> 00:12:51,843
It's really great you did this.
I thought you didn't even like Ann.

250
00:12:51,943 --> 00:12:54,673
But since you do, I thought maybe
I could get your opinion.

251
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:57,044
I was thinking of giving her, like,
a pre-engagement-

252
00:12:57,149 --> 00:12:59,481
- Ring?
- Ah.

253
00:12:59,584 --> 00:13:02,451
Wow. That catches me off guard,
George Michael. I'm not sure about that.

254
00:13:02,554 --> 00:13:04,852
I don't know if it's-

255
00:13:04,956 --> 00:13:06,890
I think it's gonna
backfire on you.

256
00:13:06,992 --> 00:13:10,086
I think it could backfire on you
because it's gonna seem...

257
00:13:10,195 --> 00:13:12,720
like you're taking marriage,
uh, lightly, you know.

258
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:15,356
And you can't.
It's very sacred.

259
00:13:15,467 --> 00:13:18,265
- Sacred.
- Yeah. That's it.

260
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:20,270
All right.
Well, yeah.

261
00:13:20,372 --> 00:13:22,272
You know, it did kind of
feel right to me.

262
00:13:22,374 --> 00:13:25,036
- But, yeah. I've gotta trust you, right?
- Thank you. Thank you.

263
00:13:25,143 --> 00:13:27,373
Damn. Maybe I should-

264
00:13:27,479 --> 00:13:31,813
Maybe I should ask if she wants to get
pre-pre-engaged. Add another-

265
00:13:31,917 --> 00:13:33,885
The mere fact that you're
laughing about marriage...

266
00:13:33,985 --> 00:13:36,249
- means that you're not ready, okay?
- Wha-

267
00:13:36,354 --> 00:13:38,879
<i>And Lucille was asked to the kitchen.</i>

268
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:42,983
What's so important that you're dragging me
away from this miserable party?

269
00:13:43,094 --> 00:13:46,825
Well, I just had an old friend
who wanted to tell you...

270
00:13:46,932 --> 00:13:49,560
how much I miss you!

271
00:13:49,668 --> 00:13:53,160
Oh, who let this little black-

272
00:13:53,271 --> 00:13:55,034
Hey, Brother.

273
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,836
- Who you callin' brother, you hook-ass-
- Mother!

274
00:14:01,947 --> 00:14:04,177
What the hell kind of puppet
does Buster have on his hand?

275
00:14:04,282 --> 00:14:06,273
Just let me think.

276
00:14:06,384 --> 00:14:08,352
God, Franklin.
Your breath- Oh, God.

277
00:14:08,453 --> 00:14:10,751
<i>So I'm really getting excited
about your proposal.</i>

278
00:14:10,856 --> 00:14:12,721
Oh, yeah.
I'm not gonna do it now.

279
00:14:12,824 --> 00:14:15,122
Because Ann's mom doesn't approve
of our family? Come on.

280
00:14:15,227 --> 00:14:17,695
It's just some stupid plan
your father was trying.

281
00:14:17,796 --> 00:14:19,923
Plan?

282
00:14:20,031 --> 00:14:21,362
What plan?

283
00:14:21,466 --> 00:14:23,434
Well, it's off. Sorry.

284
00:14:23,535 --> 00:14:25,526
I know that you were
excited about it.

285
00:14:25,637 --> 00:14:28,367
But, uh, you know,
in the secular world...

286
00:14:28,473 --> 00:14:30,373
I feel like
they're a bit young.

287
00:14:30,475 --> 00:14:34,707
You know, l- I didn't want to say anything
in front ofTerry, but I agree.

288
00:14:34,813 --> 00:14:38,180
I mean, perhaps there's someone else
they're meant to meet.

289
00:14:38,283 --> 00:14:40,911
Well, let's- let's just say
that in the secular world...

290
00:14:41,019 --> 00:14:44,113
one finds oneself
with their fair share of temptations.

291
00:14:44,222 --> 00:14:46,656
Not that anyone
would ever act-

292
00:14:46,758 --> 00:14:48,555
Take me.

293
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,560
- Mrs. Veal.
- Take me to your secular world.

294
00:14:50,662 --> 00:14:52,562
<i>Hey. Hey, listen.</i>

295
00:14:52,664 --> 00:14:55,724
I can't believe my dad. First he's saying
I need to respect the sanctity of marriage...

296
00:14:55,834 --> 00:14:57,734
then he's making out with her
on the balcony.

297
00:14:57,836 --> 00:15:00,566
- I thought he didn't even like Ann.
- No, no. Mrs. Veal.

298
00:15:00,672 --> 00:15:02,765
Know what else he's not gonna like?
I'm getting pre-engaged.

299
00:15:02,874 --> 00:15:05,502
- God, that's so romantic.
- The hell with him.

300
00:15:07,779 --> 00:15:10,976
Take it.
Take the sacred ring.

301
00:15:11,082 --> 00:15:13,141
Not the snake.
That doesn't come off.

302
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:20,091
<i>Michael had just been kissed
by the mother of his son's girlfriend.</i>

303
00:15:20,194 --> 00:15:22,162
- Oh, my golly!
- Listen.

304
00:15:22,263 --> 00:15:25,596
- Don't do this. Don't do this.
- I can't believe we're making love.

305
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:29,659
- What are you talking about?
We're not making love.
- I want to please you secularly.

306
00:15:29,771 --> 00:15:33,434
- We're not gonna do this.
- But you kept telling me how beautiful I was.

307
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,975
I was surprised
because of Ann.

308
00:15:36,077 --> 00:15:37,601
- Well-
- Why because of Ann?

309
00:15:37,712 --> 00:15:40,806
<i>Because of
an old wives' tale.</i>

310
00:15:40,915 --> 00:15:42,940
- Oh, I'm so ashamed.
- All right. No-

311
00:15:43,051 --> 00:15:44,985
Mrs. Veal.

312
00:15:45,086 --> 00:15:48,954
Jolly news, governor.
Young master's proposing.

313
00:15:49,057 --> 00:15:52,026
George Michael?
I told him not to. He said he wouldn't.

314
00:15:52,126 --> 00:15:56,358
Well, this was before he saw you
pounding that sweet piece of veal.

315
00:15:56,464 --> 00:16:00,457
- He saw that? Where is he?
- Oh, he left with Lady Lindsay-

316
00:16:00,568 --> 00:16:03,867
- Tobias, where are they?
- It is me. It's Tobias.

317
00:16:06,107 --> 00:16:08,007
<i>- What happened?
- What's going on?</i>

318
00:16:08,109 --> 00:16:10,475
<i>Gob made me kiss Franklin.
I think my father was here.</i>

319
00:16:10,578 --> 00:16:12,705
Maybe he still is.

320
00:16:12,814 --> 00:16:14,714
Shut up. What do you mean
he was here?

321
00:16:14,816 --> 00:16:17,216
I think he was
dragging my mother out with Gob.

322
00:16:17,318 --> 00:16:19,616
- Oh, you shut up.
- What's goin' on?

323
00:16:19,721 --> 00:16:22,315
<i>We're tryin'to figure that out.
Apparently Pop-Pop kidnapped Gangy...</i>

324
00:16:22,423 --> 00:16:24,721
and I have no idea where George Michael is-
or Lindsay.

325
00:16:24,826 --> 00:16:27,818
I just saw them drive off.
They're gonna go look for Bland.

326
00:16:27,929 --> 00:16:30,090
- Who's the hottie?
- This is Ann's mother.

327
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:31,324
Her?

328
00:16:31,432 --> 00:16:34,094
Does she look old enough
to play Topher Grace's mom?

329
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:36,500
- Where did you say Ann was?
- At the chapel.

330
00:16:36,604 --> 00:16:40,506
Yeah, we gotta get down there.
My son's gonna pre-propose to your daughter.

331
00:16:40,608 --> 00:16:44,374
<i>Fortunately,
Tobias had rented a car to maintain his ruse.</i>

332
00:16:44,479 --> 00:16:46,379
I had this shipped over
from "Blackstool."

333
00:16:46,481 --> 00:16:49,450
It's what I used to drive
the Roger Moores about in.

334
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,018
<i>And Lucille awoke, half in the bag.</i>

335
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,418
What am I doing
in a Nordstrom bag?

336
00:16:54,522 --> 00:16:58,686
It's me. I'm taking you
to renew our vows.

337
00:16:58,793 --> 00:17:00,761
- But first-
- Uh, Dad-

338
00:17:00,862 --> 00:17:03,695
<i>- we make love.
- The partition doesn't go
all the way up, remember?</i>

339
00:17:03,798 --> 00:17:06,824
No. No. After your vows.

340
00:17:06,934 --> 00:17:09,698
I want to know you won't
run out on me again.

341
00:17:09,804 --> 00:17:13,433
- I need to know you're in it for keeps.
- Just let me see 'em.

342
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:17,238
<i>- Seriously, Dad. The radio doesn't work either.
- George!</i>

343
00:17:17,345 --> 00:17:19,643
<i>Gob raced his parents to the church...</i>

344
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,908
<i>passing George Michael
and Lindsay...</i>

345
00:17:22,016 --> 00:17:24,644
<i>who were soon followed
by Mrs. Featherbottom.</i>

346
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,845
Oh, mercy me!

347
00:17:26,954 --> 00:17:29,218
I keep forgetting
I'm in the colonies.

348
00:17:29,323 --> 00:17:32,781
<i>Buster was talking to
the police when Oscar found a clue.</i>

349
00:17:32,894 --> 00:17:34,919
They must be going
to this church.

350
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:37,554
He's going to renew
his vows.

351
00:17:37,665 --> 00:17:40,896
He's my twin brother.
I know how he thinks.

352
00:17:41,002 --> 00:17:43,061
They're at
the Church of the Good Shepherd.

353
00:17:43,171 --> 00:17:46,538
<i>And at the chapel, Pastor Veal was officiating.</i>

354
00:17:46,641 --> 00:17:49,007
"...to love and honor
your spirit and flesh.

355
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,943
"First the flesh.
I will caress and tweak.

356
00:17:52,046 --> 00:17:53,775
"I will nibble and bite.

357
00:17:53,881 --> 00:17:57,647
<i>I will blow alternatingly
hot and cool."</i>

358
00:17:57,752 --> 00:18:00,949
Oh, man.
I can't wait to get married.

359
00:18:01,055 --> 00:18:03,751
<i>Ann went to cool down,
where George Michael found her.</i>

360
00:18:03,858 --> 00:18:05,758
<i>Ann, I have something
to ask you.</i>

361
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,760
Well, l- I really like you.

362
00:18:07,862 --> 00:18:10,956
I guess what l- I want to ask you is,
will you one day...

363
00:18:11,065 --> 00:18:12,760
uh, intend to marry me?

364
00:18:12,867 --> 00:18:16,462
It would be great to hear back on this
before the real hard A.P. Stuff kicks in.

365
00:18:16,571 --> 00:18:18,630
Let's do it. Now.

366
00:18:18,739 --> 00:18:21,207
- Let's actually get married.
- Right now?

367
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:23,869
My father's in there.
He can do it as soon as he finishes.

368
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:28,210
"I'll always be here for you
to rest your ankles upon my shoulders."

369
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:30,284
<i>And Michael showed up at the chapel.</i>

370
00:18:30,384 --> 00:18:32,284
Uh, listen, buddy. Dad?

371
00:18:32,386 --> 00:18:34,320
Uh, faster, Pastor.

372
00:18:34,422 --> 00:18:38,017
<i>Stop this!
Stop this now!</i>

373
00:18:38,126 --> 00:18:41,721
<i>Oscar charged at George Sr.,
finally willing to fight for Lucille.</i>

374
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:44,821
<i>But they did think alike...</i>

375
00:18:44,932 --> 00:18:47,298
<i>and neither could
land a blow.</i>

376
00:18:49,237 --> 00:18:51,228
Dad, do us.
We're ready to get married.

377
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:53,603
George Michael,
don't do this just to get back at me.

378
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:57,371
What you saw on the balcony-
Uh, Mrs. Veal started kissing me.

379
00:18:57,478 --> 00:18:59,708
<i>This part of it was news to George Michael.</i>

380
00:18:59,814 --> 00:19:02,783
<i>Unfortunately, it was
also news to Pastor Veal.</i>

381
00:19:02,884 --> 00:19:05,409
- You kissed my wife?
- No. She started kissing me.

382
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,420
You really should
lock that down.

383
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:11,686
<i>And Pastor Veal, too,
was ready to fight for the woman he loved.</i>

384
00:19:15,129 --> 00:19:17,256
Ah. Finally.
Where have you been?

385
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:20,857
<i>The police had been delayed when they
thought they'd cornered a kidnapping suspect.</i>

386
00:19:20,968 --> 00:19:24,233
Put your hands up, or we'll take that
as a sign of aggression against us.

387
00:19:24,338 --> 00:19:26,738
They're not up!
He's aggressive!

388
00:19:26,841 --> 00:19:29,708
<i>- Got a little hot out there.
- Well, it's getting pretty hot in here.</i>

389
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:33,075
<i>- She's mine!
- No. She's mine.</i>

390
00:19:33,181 --> 00:19:35,547
<i>Oscar, I don't want her.
I don't want either of them.</i>

391
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:37,845
Oh. Sorry.
Where's my brother?

392
00:19:37,952 --> 00:19:40,011
Look at all the bobbies.

393
00:19:40,121 --> 00:19:43,181
<i>Oh, no. My wig
seems to have run off.</i>

394
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:45,452
<i>On George Sr., as it turned out.</i>

395
00:19:47,295 --> 00:19:51,231
- Who is this guy?
- This guy is my husband.

396
00:19:51,332 --> 00:19:54,028
<i>Terry, I don't know what happened.</i>

397
00:19:54,135 --> 00:19:58,128
I fell under the spell
of that horrible secular family.

398
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:00,207
Forgive me.

399
00:20:00,308 --> 00:20:03,539
<i>Could've used that horrible
family stuff about a halfhour ago.</i>

400
00:20:03,644 --> 00:20:06,772
I hope you notice
I didn't run.

401
00:20:06,881 --> 00:20:10,317
- You fought for me.
- What I meant to say is l- I think I broke my ankle.

402
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:14,582
Let's alternate
hot and cool on that.

403
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:19,220
- Guess the wedding's off?
- Yeah. That's okay, Dad.

404
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:22,490
We were talking, and we think that
we were doin' it for the wrong reasons.

405
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:26,465
Yeah? You have so much to experience before
you make a commitment you're not ready for.

406
00:20:26,567 --> 00:20:28,398
You need to get to
know each other better...

407
00:20:28,502 --> 00:20:31,562
and then you can be comfortable
going all the way with it.

408
00:20:31,672 --> 00:20:35,073
- Do you mean it?
- Yes. This time I'm being honest with you.

409
00:20:35,176 --> 00:20:37,906
- Thanks, Dad.
- Okay.

410
00:20:38,012 --> 00:20:42,745
It sounds like your father just
gave us permission to start doing it.

411
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:45,011
You must teach me,
George Michael.

412
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:48,418
You must teach me
the ways of the secular flesh.

413
00:20:52,727 --> 00:20:54,922
<i>On the next Arrested Development.</i>

414
00:20:55,029 --> 00:20:56,929
That doesn't bother you.

415
00:20:57,031 --> 00:21:00,262
<i>Buster finds someone else
interested in kissing his hook.</i>

416
00:21:00,368 --> 00:21:03,303
- Oh, God!
- Drug dog's got something. Get him, Bennett!

417
00:21:03,404 --> 00:21:05,668
<i>So Buster gets a hook replacement.</i>

418
00:21:05,773 --> 00:21:08,264
They're not gonna let you in
at the country club with that.

419
00:21:08,376 --> 00:21:11,004
I don't want no part
of your tight-ass country club...

420
00:21:11,112 --> 00:21:13,205
you freak bitch!
