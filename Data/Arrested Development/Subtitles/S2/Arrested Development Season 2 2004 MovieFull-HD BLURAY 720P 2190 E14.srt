1
00:00:01,011 --> 00:00:04,412
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:04,514 --> 00:00:06,505
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:06,616 --> 00:00:08,607
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:14,124 --> 00:00:15,751
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

5
00:00:18,061 --> 00:00:20,291
<i>Michael was surprised to find the house...</i>

6
00:00:20,397 --> 00:00:22,865
<i>still a mess a week
after the fumigation.</i>

7
00:00:22,966 --> 00:00:27,699
You still haven't put this stuff back yet?
You've got to be the laziest person in the world.

8
00:00:27,804 --> 00:00:30,898
If you weren't all the way on the other side
of the room, I'd slap your face.

9
00:00:31,007 --> 00:00:34,443
- I asked you to clean this up.
- Yeah, and you also asked me
to call the fumigators...

10
00:00:34,544 --> 00:00:36,705
and you haven't even thanked me
for doing that.

11
00:00:36,813 --> 00:00:39,976
<i>Michael had asked her
to do this, but that was long before...</i>

12
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:42,643
<i>he began hiding his fugitive father
in the attic.</i>

13
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:46,620
What? Uh- Oh, God.

14
00:00:46,723 --> 00:00:49,715
Polly, cover your mouth!

15
00:00:49,826 --> 00:00:53,728
<i>Luckily, Michael was notified in time.</i>

16
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:57,129
<i>Well, we had a deal, you know. I'd pay
for everything, and you'd clean the house.</i>

17
00:00:57,233 --> 00:01:00,066
<i>- And you've only done it once.
- She hadn't even done it that time...</i>

18
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,298
<i>but instead, intercepted
her mother's housekeeper...</i>

19
00:01:03,406 --> 00:01:05,772
<i>- as she was arriving for work.
- Can I take you the rest of the way?</i>

20
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:10,403
<i>- Mrs.- Mrs.-
- Oh, I have to make one quick stop first.</i>

21
00:01:10,513 --> 00:01:15,007
<i>Almost done. Yours or mister's?</i>

22
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:17,143
Mister's.

23
00:01:17,253 --> 00:01:20,086
<i>Lupe never accepted a ride from Lindsay again.</i>

24
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:24,149
<i>Well, I'm sorry, Michael,
but Tobias moving out hasn't been easy.</i>

25
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,285
For any of us.

26
00:01:26,396 --> 00:01:28,626
You didn't even notice he'd gone,
did you?

27
00:01:28,731 --> 00:01:30,926
<i>I did notice we'd stopped TiVoing
The Christopher Lowell Show.</i>

28
00:01:31,034 --> 00:01:34,663
<i>- What happened?
- I tried to give it one last chance.</i>

29
00:01:34,771 --> 00:01:37,831
<i>- Like what you see?
- I've been looking for those.</i>

30
00:01:37,941 --> 00:01:40,603
- You're gonna stretch them out.
- That's all you can say?

31
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,941
Well, excuse me for liking the way
they shape my junk.

32
00:01:44,047 --> 00:01:46,447
I don't know why, but that's it.

33
00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:50,349
You can pack your junk
and get out.

34
00:01:50,453 --> 00:01:53,013
You're kicking me out?
At the beginning of pilot season?

35
00:01:53,123 --> 00:01:57,492
You're not gonna make it as an actor,
and we're not gonna make it as a couple.

36
00:01:57,594 --> 00:02:00,620
<i>With nowhere to go,
Tobias went to the studio...</i>

37
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:04,063
<i>where he'd occasionally worked
as a security guard and took up residence...</i>

38
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:08,126
<i>in the apartment of Detective Frank Wrench,
on the set of the television show...</i>

39
00:02:08,238 --> 00:02:10,365
Wrench.

40
00:02:10,473 --> 00:02:13,499
<i>I'm really sorry to hear that.
How's Maeby taking it?</i>

41
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:17,205
- Well, she's really hard to read.
- You haven't told her yet.

42
00:02:17,313 --> 00:02:19,873
Well, she was so excited the hot water
in the shower was lasting longer.

43
00:02:19,983 --> 00:02:22,816
How could I have the heart to tell her
it's because her father moved out?

44
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:26,150
Tobias moved out?

45
00:02:26,256 --> 00:02:29,987
<i>- Did he take the good video camera with him?
- That's touching.</i>

46
00:02:30,093 --> 00:02:33,187
- What do you need the camera for?
- I'm making a magic video.

47
00:02:33,296 --> 00:02:35,924
I'm gonna tape myself
doing tricks around the office.

48
00:02:36,032 --> 00:02:40,264
<i>I'm calling it Tricks-
Let me finish- around the Office.</i>

49
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,861
I figured out a way to
make money while I'm working.

50
00:02:42,972 --> 00:02:46,237
<i>That is what we call working. Something
you might wanna try next time you're at the office.</i>

51
00:02:46,342 --> 00:02:50,039
<i>You've been missing things lately.
I'm gettin'real tired of it.</i>

52
00:02:50,146 --> 00:02:52,740
<i>Incidentally, today we're having a big vote
on that building renovation.</i>

53
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:55,682
- I need you there to help me vote it in.
- Fine. I'll vote...

54
00:02:55,785 --> 00:02:57,685
as long as
you give me the camera.

55
00:02:57,787 --> 00:03:00,620
I think we all know
that George Michael was using it last.

56
00:03:00,723 --> 00:03:04,819
<i>A fact the family had discovered
when they'd gathered to watch a home video.</i>

57
00:03:04,928 --> 00:03:08,261
Was that a 40th anniversary party, huh?
Didn't cost us a thing.

58
00:03:08,364 --> 00:03:11,299
Is that Qusay Hussein
at the omelet bar?

59
00:03:11,401 --> 00:03:14,461
Look at this. If these guys move,
they don't get paid.

60
00:03:16,206 --> 00:03:19,107
<i>It seems that as a 13-year-old,
George Michael had been...</i>

61
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:21,871
<i>heavily influenced
by the Star Wars films...</i>

62
00:03:21,978 --> 00:03:25,470
<i>and had endeavored to
re-create his favorite moments.</i>

63
00:03:25,582 --> 00:03:28,745
- You're not my father! You'll never be!
- I spent $2.1 million...

64
00:03:28,851 --> 00:03:31,319
<i>of good company money
and end up with this?</i>

65
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:33,719
<i>You cut off my hand!
Worth every penny.</i>

66
00:03:33,823 --> 00:03:37,315
Even you have to admit that
that was the lamest thing ever put on tape.

67
00:03:37,427 --> 00:03:40,692
<i>Not so. Buster
had once videotaped himself...</i>

68
00:03:40,797 --> 00:03:44,665
<i>re-creating moments from his
then favorite film, Chicago.</i>

69
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:49,397
<i>He also liked Star Wars.</i>

70
00:03:51,341 --> 00:03:54,310
His self-esteem is low enough as it is,
and I have no idea why.

71
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:57,573
<i>I mean, he's such a great kid, and
everybody loves him. He's George Michael!</i>

72
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,777
<i>Truthfully, that's why I'm not that crazy
about that Ann, but he'll move on.</i>

73
00:04:02,885 --> 00:04:06,821
Unless he knocks her up like you did
with his mother. Plus, she's religious.

74
00:04:06,923 --> 00:04:09,915
If that one gets pregnant,
it stays pregnant.

75
00:04:10,026 --> 00:04:13,860
Believe me. I dated a chick like that
once in high school.

76
00:04:13,963 --> 00:04:16,090
No, I didn't.

77
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:19,965
<i>I gotta work
on that boy's self-esteem.</i>

78
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:23,334
<i>Michael went to do so,
only to hear Ann beating him to it.</i>

79
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:25,498
<i>- I want you to do it.
- I don't think I'm ready.</i>

80
00:04:25,608 --> 00:04:27,872
<i>- Of course you are.
- I'm gonna lose it before I start.</i>

81
00:04:27,977 --> 00:04:30,309
Don't start!

82
00:04:30,413 --> 00:04:34,782
Smoking. It's a killer. That Sammy Davis Jr.
Should still be performing.

83
00:04:34,884 --> 00:04:37,876
- What's going on?
- Ann thinks I should run
for student body president.

84
00:04:37,987 --> 00:04:40,455
- That's a great idea.
- Well, I don't have a chance.

85
00:04:40,556 --> 00:04:43,491
- They only vote for the cool kids.
- But everyone loves you.

86
00:04:43,593 --> 00:04:45,857
You are George Michael!
Who's cooler than you?

87
00:04:48,264 --> 00:04:50,494
Plus, you would be following
in your old man's footsteps.

88
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,693
- You were student body president?
- Oh-ho.

89
00:04:52,802 --> 00:04:55,134
- It was close.
- So you lost.

90
00:04:55,238 --> 00:04:57,001
- Who remembers?
- I know I would remember.

91
00:04:57,106 --> 00:04:59,165
Ann, if my dad says
that he won, then he won.

92
00:04:59,275 --> 00:05:01,709
<i>Didn't say I won.
Said I can't remember.</i>

93
00:05:01,811 --> 00:05:06,145
But now that we're thinking about it, I seem
to remember the other guy won the title...

94
00:05:06,249 --> 00:05:09,218
although there were plenty in the school
who wanted to overturn the decision.

95
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:13,847
I said, "Let's- Do not- Let's not
put the school through that."

96
00:05:13,956 --> 00:05:16,424
Haven't thought about that for years.
Good memory.

97
00:05:16,526 --> 00:05:20,485
<i>Well, anyway, I'll help you run your campaign
and make your commercial for election day.</i>

98
00:05:20,596 --> 00:05:23,121
Well, that's great.
The important thing is...

99
00:05:23,232 --> 00:05:28,932
to raise the old self-esteem and not
to rush a physical relationship.

100
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:32,371
<i>- Those are really the two important things.
- No. We're both waiting.</i>

101
00:05:32,475 --> 00:05:36,844
- Good.
- And then that first time,
after waiting and waiting-

102
00:05:36,946 --> 00:05:40,211
It's gonna be so awesome, because it's not
just gonna be my love and George Michael's...

103
00:05:40,316 --> 00:05:42,284
but God's love as well.

104
00:05:42,385 --> 00:05:46,014
<i>- God, it's gonna be incredible.
- All right. I'll do it. I'm in.</i>

105
00:05:46,122 --> 00:05:48,352
- Campaign?
- I'm pumped.

106
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:51,552
<i>As George Michael was
on the path to higher self-esteem...</i>

107
00:05:51,661 --> 00:05:54,494
<i>Buster was losing
what little he had.</i>

108
00:05:54,597 --> 00:05:56,531
I can't put the aorta in
with this thing.

109
00:05:56,632 --> 00:05:59,499
<i>Oh, stop complaining.</i>

110
00:05:59,602 --> 00:06:03,868
- Buster!
- I'm sorry I'm an inconvenience to you, Mother.

111
00:06:03,973 --> 00:06:08,603
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh!

112
00:06:08,711 --> 00:06:11,874
<i>As Lupe felt sorry...</i>

113
00:06:11,981 --> 00:06:16,884
<i>for Buster's loss of a hand,
Lindsay felt sorry for her loss of Lupe.</i>

114
00:06:30,266 --> 00:06:33,963
<i>Lindsay had cleaned one room
and now had a garbage problem.</i>

115
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:37,471
<i>And while looking for a spot to stash the refuse...</i>

116
00:06:37,573 --> 00:06:39,473
<i>She came upon an old friend.</i>

117
00:06:39,575 --> 00:06:43,170
I haven't seen this in ages. EBay.

118
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:46,180
<i>Unfortunately,
it was a new friend to George Sr.</i>

119
00:06:46,282 --> 00:06:49,308
Polly!

120
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:54,049
<i>Back at the office, Michael came
to regret having given Gob the video camera.</i>

121
00:06:54,157 --> 00:06:56,318
Well, I certainly
appreciate your decision...

122
00:06:56,426 --> 00:06:59,088
but if my brother was here,
we could've voted this thing through.

123
00:06:59,195 --> 00:07:03,393
What's this?
A stuffy office meeting?

124
00:07:03,499 --> 00:07:07,993
<i>Well, maybe it's time
for a little... Office Magic.</i>

125
00:07:08,104 --> 00:07:13,440
<i>- What's "office magic"?
- Sometimes it's as simple as turning 10:45...</i>

126
00:07:13,543 --> 00:07:17,479
in the morning into lunchtime!

127
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,845
- Okay.
- Why does lunch have to be so dull?

128
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:25,148
Maybe you'd
prefer some chicken instead!

129
00:07:25,254 --> 00:07:28,815
All right. Let's cut.
Take five, everybody.

130
00:07:28,925 --> 00:07:32,156
- No, no. We're not takin' five.
Hey, is this guy with you?
- Yeah, he's an actor.

131
00:07:32,261 --> 00:07:35,287
Well, you know, I thought
he was an investor. He voted against me...

132
00:07:35,398 --> 00:07:37,958
which is the vote I asked you
to be here for, so-

133
00:07:38,067 --> 00:07:41,867
You know what? I don't know why, but that's it.
I don't think I can work with you anymore.

134
00:07:41,971 --> 00:07:44,462
- You kind of have to, guy. I'm the president.
- No. I'm the president.

135
00:07:44,574 --> 00:07:48,408
No. You lost the presidency, just like you did
in high school when you refused to play dirty.

136
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:50,979
- Worked when I ran.
- We're talkin' about the office here, okay?

137
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,071
I do all the work. I've been helping you.
That's over now.

138
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:57,016
Sorry to hear you say that, Michael,
'cause it just cost you your job.

139
00:07:57,119 --> 00:07:59,883
- I'm serious. It's over.
- How do you call Security on this thing?

140
00:07:59,989 --> 00:08:03,049
- You hit pound-zero-zero to operate the system.
- Pound is tic-tac-toe, right?

141
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:05,855
- Yeah. Pound is right-
- When I keep hitting that, the other thing flashes.

142
00:08:05,962 --> 00:08:08,396
- Hit pound and then zero-zero.
- I do. I know.

143
00:08:08,498 --> 00:08:11,399
Tell you what. You don't need to learn
the system, because you're out of here.

144
00:08:11,501 --> 00:08:13,992
You're fired.

145
00:08:14,103 --> 00:08:16,003
Have Security send a man up.

146
00:08:16,105 --> 00:08:18,505
You've got the wrong guy.

147
00:08:18,608 --> 00:08:21,600
<i>Uh, no, you don't,
but you don't have to do this.</i>

148
00:08:21,711 --> 00:08:25,442
<i>But the guard had recently
lost halfhis tie to Office Magic.</i>

149
00:08:25,548 --> 00:08:28,415
- Oh, I don't mind.
- Get this. You getting this?

150
00:08:28,518 --> 00:08:31,419
Cheat out.
You have to cheat out a little bit.

151
00:08:31,521 --> 00:08:34,183
- Oh, hey.
- What was that all about?

152
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:37,123
Your uncle doesn't
not-work here anymore.

153
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:41,526
- So I guess your mom told you
about your dad moving out, huh?
- No, she did not tell me that.

154
00:08:41,631 --> 00:08:43,861
- Oh.
- But she doesn't tell me anything.

155
00:08:43,966 --> 00:08:47,026
- Neither of them do.
- Sorry. Guess I shouldn't have said anything.

156
00:08:47,136 --> 00:08:50,299
Maybe I should just start
keeping some secrets of my own.

157
00:08:50,406 --> 00:08:52,465
Why aren't you at school right now?

158
00:08:52,575 --> 00:08:55,066
Marry me.

159
00:08:55,177 --> 00:08:58,078
I'm so sorry.
I forgot who I was talking to.

160
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:01,775
I was just using your copier
to make some campaign posters.

161
00:09:01,884 --> 00:09:04,648
Well, then, by all means,
let me help you out.

162
00:09:04,754 --> 00:09:07,552
I mean, I don't even know why I'm doing it.
He's gonna win by a landslide.

163
00:09:07,657 --> 00:09:10,148
- That's what I was tellin' him.
- How do you know Steve Holt?

164
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:12,659
- Are you in A.A.?
- I was talkin' about George Michael.

165
00:09:12,762 --> 00:09:14,992
He's running for student body president.
Who's Steve Holt?

166
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:18,066
He's just the hottest guy in school.
And he's won three years in a row-

167
00:09:18,167 --> 00:09:20,067
every year after his first junior year.

168
00:09:20,169 --> 00:09:22,399
So, then, he's more popular
than George Michael?

169
00:09:22,505 --> 00:09:26,908
Well, that's like comparing apples
and some fruit nobody's ever heard of.

170
00:09:27,009 --> 00:09:29,500
He might even finish
after the Indian kid.

171
00:09:29,612 --> 00:09:33,048
I guess I gotta get down to the school
and see if I can stop him from signing up, huh?

172
00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:37,017
Yes. You have to. And do you think you could
put up a couple of these when you're there...

173
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:40,179
'cause I was really not
in the mood to go down there.

174
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:44,089
<i>Michael went to take care ofhis son...</i>

175
00:09:44,193 --> 00:09:47,924
<i>as Lucille discovered that hers
was already being taken care of.</i>

176
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:53,058
Mother!
- And yet you're too good
to polish the candlesticks?

177
00:09:53,169 --> 00:09:55,763
- You're fired!
- You can't fire me. I'm your son.

178
00:09:55,871 --> 00:09:58,669
- I'm firing you!
- I was firing Lupe!

179
00:09:58,774 --> 00:10:00,503
Well, that makes more sense.

180
00:10:03,521 --> 00:10:06,251
<i>- Lindsay came upon Lupe, who'd just been fired.
- I no clean for family anymore.</i>

181
00:10:06,358 --> 00:10:10,089
Can't you at least
come over and Dust Buster or something?

182
00:10:10,195 --> 00:10:13,722
- I no does Buster anymore.
- Fine.

183
00:10:13,832 --> 00:10:17,825
I'll Dust Buster! God.

184
00:10:17,936 --> 00:10:20,166
- Hello?
- Hey. I can't talk loudly.

185
00:10:20,271 --> 00:10:23,172
<i>I'm in the bathroom of the Wrench set,
and they've started shooting.</i>

186
00:10:23,274 --> 00:10:27,404
Also, I don't think this is a real toilet.

187
00:10:27,512 --> 00:10:31,380
So I just wanted to check on Maeby
and tell you that I haven't landed a part yet...

188
00:10:31,483 --> 00:10:35,214
but despite what you may think,
my talent shall win out.

189
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,120
Well, Maeby's fine. We've been looking
for a cleaning lady, so if you hear of one-

190
00:10:39,224 --> 00:10:41,954
<i>Shh- Shh.
- ... dirty cop,
so Frank Wrench is gonna clean ya.</i>

191
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,995
<i>- Why is this door locked?
- Cut!</i>

192
00:10:45,096 --> 00:10:48,190
<i>- Is somebody using the set bathroom?
- I gotta go.</i>

193
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:52,099
<i>Michael arrived at school
to talk his son out of running for office.</i>

194
00:10:52,203 --> 00:10:55,229
It took me all day, but I got the 10 signatures.
I'm running for student body president.

195
00:10:55,340 --> 00:11:00,903
<i>- Listen, George Michael-
- We're gonna use your idea
and highlight being chaste.</i>

196
00:11:01,012 --> 00:11:04,311
I just meant you two shouldn't-
You're not gonna put up this poster, are you?

197
00:11:05,917 --> 00:11:08,010
It's really gonna appeal
to the Christian crowd.

198
00:11:08,119 --> 00:11:10,815
I couldn't have done this without you guys.
I'm gonna win this thing.

199
00:11:10,922 --> 00:11:15,382
Four more years! Four more years!

200
00:11:15,493 --> 00:11:17,961
Four more years!
Four more years!

201
00:11:18,063 --> 00:11:20,964
<i>And Gob showed up at his mother's.</i>

202
00:11:21,066 --> 00:11:24,229
- Well, guess who's been fired.
- Michael fired you?

203
00:11:24,335 --> 00:11:28,066
No. I fired him. As a result,
I'm no longer welcome in the office.

204
00:11:28,173 --> 00:11:31,142
What a coincidence.
I just fired my housekeeper...

205
00:11:31,242 --> 00:11:33,642
but I've already found a replacement.

206
00:11:33,745 --> 00:11:36,509
It's a robot.

207
00:11:36,614 --> 00:11:40,983
- I hate it. I miss Lupe.
- No. I won't let you go down that road.

208
00:11:41,086 --> 00:11:44,180
I want you to be strong, and you don't
need the comfort of an immigrant...

209
00:11:44,289 --> 00:11:46,951
in Mother's old stirrup pants
to make you feel that way.

210
00:11:48,026 --> 00:11:49,926
Oh.

211
00:11:50,028 --> 00:11:53,520
Ohh, you're hungry.

212
00:11:53,631 --> 00:11:57,294
<i>Lindsay was about
to find a replacement for Lupe as well.
- Who is it?</i>

213
00:11:57,402 --> 00:12:00,530
The new housekeeper. The agency sent me over.

214
00:12:00,638 --> 00:12:02,697
I'm sorry. I didn't call any-

215
00:12:02,807 --> 00:12:08,040
Oh, allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Phyllidia Featherbottom...

216
00:12:08,146 --> 00:12:13,049
and I can cook and I can clean
and I can take care of the little ones.

217
00:12:13,151 --> 00:12:17,952
I can also sing a song or two,
if it comes in handy.

218
00:12:18,056 --> 00:12:22,425
When you put a squirt
of frosting on your throat

219
00:12:22,527 --> 00:12:24,495
Before we take
our medications

220
00:12:24,596 --> 00:12:29,192
<i>Tobias had gained access to
the studio's wardrobe and makeup department.</i>

221
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,598
<i>He was eager
to both see his daughter...</i>

222
00:12:31,703 --> 00:12:35,639
<i>and prove to his wife
that he had what it took to be an actor.</i>

223
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:40,541
<i>- It was the exact plot of the film Mrs. Doubtfire.
- In the most delicious way</i>

224
00:12:40,645 --> 00:12:44,809
<i>There was also
some Mary Poppins in there.
- Let's get this house cleaned.</i>

225
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:48,079
Hey. Lindsay,
the place looks fantastic.

226
00:12:48,186 --> 00:12:53,180
- What? Did you pay somebody to do this?
- Oh, I've no need for payment.

227
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,919
The love of the family
is more than enough.

228
00:12:56,027 --> 00:12:59,053
I'm sorry.
This is Mrs. Featherbottom.

229
00:12:59,164 --> 00:13:01,997
From Blackstone.
I'm charmed, I'm sure.

230
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,399
Ooh!

231
00:13:05,503 --> 00:13:07,869
Back to work.

232
00:13:07,972 --> 00:13:10,600
- I think he misses his daughter.
- That's convenient...

233
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:13,939
considering you didn't even have the courage
to tell Maeby that he'd moved out.

234
00:13:14,045 --> 00:13:16,513
I'm sorry.
I'm not the perfect parent, like you.

235
00:13:16,614 --> 00:13:19,777
I'm not that perfect. I pushed George Michael
into running for office...

236
00:13:19,884 --> 00:13:22,785
and I think he's gonna
get crushed by this kid Steve Holt.

237
00:13:22,887 --> 00:13:26,288
<i>Yeah. I'd vote for Steve.
Too bad Dad's on the lam.</i>

238
00:13:26,391 --> 00:13:31,090
You could finally use some of his dirty tricks
to get George Michael elected.

239
00:13:31,196 --> 00:13:33,596
<i>As it happens,
George Sr. Had come to...</i>

240
00:13:33,698 --> 00:13:37,395
<i>in the attic, and perhaps it was the effect
oflosing his one friend-</i>

241
00:13:37,502 --> 00:13:40,528
<i>- Polly?
- or the lingering effects of the fumigation-</i>

242
00:13:40,638 --> 00:13:43,471
<i>or perhaps it really was
divine intervention-</i>

243
00:13:43,575 --> 00:13:47,375
<i>but he'd had a profound realization.</i>

244
00:13:50,548 --> 00:13:54,109
<i>Unfortunately, the timing
of the enlightenment wasn't ideal for Michael.</i>

245
00:13:54,219 --> 00:13:58,280
- That's why I need your help.
- "Our Heavenly Father let his son die...

246
00:13:58,389 --> 00:14:00,789
so that our sins
could be absolved."

247
00:14:00,892 --> 00:14:04,953
- Great. So you're a Christian now.
- "We must all seek forgiveness."

248
00:14:05,063 --> 00:14:07,554
Well, I'll call the warden for you.
You can ask him yourself.

249
00:14:07,665 --> 00:14:13,126
Well, I think that's for fresh crimes.
Besides, you've always tried to lead a clean life.

250
00:14:13,238 --> 00:14:18,574
You and Gob were like
those biblical brothers, Gallant and, um-

251
00:14:18,676 --> 00:14:20,667
"Goofuth."

252
00:14:20,778 --> 00:14:24,009
<i>Michael realized he had lived like Gallant...</i>

253
00:14:24,115 --> 00:14:26,675
<i>and ifhe wanted
to help his son's election...</i>

254
00:14:26,784 --> 00:14:28,911
<i>he would have to find...
Goofuth.</i>

255
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,614
- Been lookin' all over for you, pal.
- If you came to grovel...

256
00:14:31,723 --> 00:14:33,691
for the job of president,
you're too late.

257
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:38,785
- My brother already fired me.
- Listen, I'm really sorry that I got upset with you...

258
00:14:38,896 --> 00:14:42,300
you know, and I never meant to, um-
I didn't even mean to fire you.

259
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,325
You know, and I never meant to, um-
I didn't even mean to fire you.

260
00:14:44,435 --> 00:14:48,804
You know? I just got so frustrated,
and, Gob, you are my brother.

261
00:14:48,906 --> 00:14:52,637
- Of course I'm gonna support you.
- Well...

262
00:14:52,744 --> 00:14:54,803
now I feel bad for firing you.

263
00:14:54,912 --> 00:14:58,348
Listen, George Michael is running
for student body president...

264
00:14:58,449 --> 00:15:00,349
and I have a feeling
he's gonna get slaughtered.

265
00:15:00,451 --> 00:15:03,386
The guy he's running against
is basically a young you.

266
00:15:03,488 --> 00:15:08,790
Wow. It won't be easy
to win a race against myself.

267
00:15:08,893 --> 00:15:11,726
- Of course, if anyone can do it, I can.
- That's right.

268
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:15,321
- I wish I was 15 years younger.
- He doesn't need to beat him.

269
00:15:15,433 --> 00:15:18,891
- He just needs to beat the Indian kid.
- If I do this, you'll rehire me?

270
00:15:19,003 --> 00:15:21,767
- Of course I will.
- The mere fact that you think you can...

271
00:15:21,873 --> 00:15:25,001
says to me
that I shouldn't let you.

272
00:15:25,109 --> 00:15:29,307
Course,
we both need the work.

273
00:15:29,414 --> 00:15:31,382
Robot'll get it.

274
00:15:31,482 --> 00:15:34,076
Where the hell is my maid?
Robot!

275
00:15:34,185 --> 00:15:37,643
<i>But the robot was busy elsewhere.</i>

276
00:15:40,792 --> 00:15:44,387
What do you expect, Mother? I'm half machine!

277
00:15:45,863 --> 00:15:48,457
I'm a monster!

278
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:59,784
<i>Michael brought Gob in
to consult on his son's campaign.</i>

279
00:15:59,893 --> 00:16:03,124
Focus on the video and shy away
from the virgin thing.

280
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:06,097
Oh, we should definitely
sacrifice the whole virgin thing.

281
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,191
<i>And I got the perfect way.</i>

282
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:12,432
We hand out rubbers that say,
"We salute George Michael."

283
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:15,633
- We're not supposed to have help.
- I don't wanna make Steve look bad.

284
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:18,802
Yeah, I just don't want my son to be
embarrassed up there. Let's not play too dirty.

285
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:22,712
- Uh, good point, two percent.
- Two percent, huh? Is that how little I lost by?

286
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:24,784
- Lost by? That's all you got.
- Not really important.

287
00:16:24,885 --> 00:16:28,787
<i>Well, if your son wants more than two percent,
he's gonna have to go after Steve Holt.</i>

288
00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:32,620
<i>So I want you to tell me every awful rumor
you've ever heard about this kid.</i>

289
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:35,160
I can't support this,
and neither can the Christian kids...

290
00:16:35,262 --> 00:16:37,958
- that were gonna make you president.
- Uh-

291
00:16:38,065 --> 00:16:40,966
<i>Ann? I think
she's really upset about this.</i>

292
00:16:41,068 --> 00:16:44,401
She'll forgive ya.
You're George Michael.

293
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:47,406
<i>Meanwhile...</i>

294
00:16:47,508 --> 00:16:49,476
<i>Maeby was meeting
her new singing nanny.</i>

295
00:16:49,576 --> 00:16:52,340
Now. Take your Fun-fun.

296
00:16:52,446 --> 00:16:56,815
This is my mom's, and it's fen-phen,
and it's been banned by the F.D.A.

297
00:16:56,917 --> 00:17:01,411
Oh! Well.
You should always read the label

298
00:17:01,522 --> 00:17:05,049
<i>You should always read it well
in the most delicious way</i>

299
00:17:05,159 --> 00:17:07,218
- Mr. Fingerbottom?
- Mrs.

300
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,557
<i>Right. Mrs.
I should really get going.</i>

301
00:17:09,663 --> 00:17:13,258
No, no, no, no, no.
Sit back. What's the rush? Please.

302
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:16,097
I wanna hear about you.
Tell me about your family.

303
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:20,765
I'm sure wherever your father is right now,
she loves you very, very much.

304
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:23,900
Not enough to be honest
with me.

305
00:17:26,513 --> 00:17:28,879
<i>And after a few days, Gob was ready...</i>

306
00:17:28,982 --> 00:17:31,212
<i>to unveil
George Michael's new message.</i>

307
00:17:31,318 --> 00:17:34,116
<i>Drought, starvation-</i>

308
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:38,419
These are the things my family
has had to deal with for generations...

309
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:41,460
although, fortunately,
not since we moved to Corona del Mar.

310
00:17:41,562 --> 00:17:45,259
<i>Go home, you terrorist!</i>

311
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:48,095
How stupid do you have to be
to say something like that?

312
00:17:48,202 --> 00:17:51,603
- You're not wanted here!
- Gob.

313
00:17:51,705 --> 00:17:54,572
- Michael.
- You got George Michael's tape?

314
00:17:54,675 --> 00:17:58,577
Yeah. I gave it to the tech guy.
Don't worry. It's very tastefully done.

315
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:01,580
Sure you didn't make that video in a cave?

316
00:18:01,682 --> 00:18:04,412
<i>- Perennial candidate Steve Holt!
- Soon it was time...</i>

317
00:18:04,518 --> 00:18:06,577
<i>for Steve Holt to play his video...</i>

318
00:18:06,687 --> 00:18:09,952
<i>which had been produced
by his new campaign manager, Ann Veal.</i>

319
00:18:10,057 --> 00:18:14,289
<i>- Hi. I'm Steve Holt.
- Evil!</i>

320
00:18:14,394 --> 00:18:17,625
This kid's popular?

321
00:18:17,731 --> 00:18:20,256
Looks like a chick I did
once in high school.

322
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:22,426
Get a haircut!

323
00:18:22,536 --> 00:18:25,562
Recently, I've been dealing with the fact
that I've never known my father...

324
00:18:25,672 --> 00:18:29,267
<i>but I finally found a new Father.</i>

325
00:18:29,376 --> 00:18:32,243
You're probably wondering
what these footsteps are.

326
00:18:32,346 --> 00:18:37,648
Well, this is my second take. It's kind of
like a second chance at making good.

327
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:43,651
<i>Yeah. Okay. We need
to pull the videotape.</i>

328
00:18:43,757 --> 00:18:46,123
- My tape?
- Why?
- I've made a huge mistake.

329
00:18:46,226 --> 00:18:50,162
<i>But it was too late
to do anything about it.</i>

330
00:18:50,264 --> 00:18:54,633
Steve Holt is a bastard.
He doesn't even know who his real father is.

331
00:18:54,735 --> 00:18:59,468
What else don't we know
about Steve Holt?

332
00:18:59,573 --> 00:19:02,838
George Michael Bluth
is a cool guy.

333
00:19:02,943 --> 00:19:06,208
His dad is a powerful executive
working for this man.

334
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:10,215
The girls like him just fine.
Young and old. It doesn't matter.

335
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:13,377
- In the dark.
- That's why you had me do that?

336
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:16,718
<i>George Michael
had never been more embarrassed.</i>

337
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:19,485
<i>Until this part.</i>

338
00:19:19,593 --> 00:19:21,652
I couldn't find another tape.

339
00:19:27,934 --> 00:19:30,960
I like Steve's more.

340
00:19:31,071 --> 00:19:34,131
Guess I underestimated
the religious vote.

341
00:19:34,241 --> 00:19:37,404
- So Steve won?
- No. Steve dropped out of the race.

342
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:40,071
He says he wants to spend some time
trying to find his real father.

343
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:43,479
Rav Nadir, the Indian kid,
he got 97% of the vote.

344
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:48,179
Well, that leaves three percent.
You did better than I did when I ran.

345
00:19:48,288 --> 00:19:50,984
I tied with Bart Simpson
and "School Sucks."

346
00:19:51,091 --> 00:19:53,116
I'm really sorry, buddy.
Believe it or not, I did this...

347
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:55,558
because I didn't want you
to feel bad about yourself.

348
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:58,392
Hey, it's Star Dork.

349
00:19:58,498 --> 00:20:01,524
Hey, he knows you now.
I'm really sorry, buddy.

350
00:20:01,635 --> 00:20:05,571
It's just a drag. I mean, I'm pretty sure
my girlfriend's gone forever...

351
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:07,697
and I never wanted
to do this in the first place.

352
00:20:07,808 --> 00:20:13,212
George Michael, was that really you
doing those lightsaber moves?

353
00:20:13,313 --> 00:20:16,510
- You were incredible.
- I've only gotten better.

354
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:19,210
You're still doin' that?

355
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:24,086
<i>So, you wanna grab a curtain rod
and go over to my place?</i>

356
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:27,251
Wow. I'd love that.
Thanks, Ann.

357
00:20:27,361 --> 00:20:30,455
You really make me
feel good about myself.

358
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,432
Gotta do something
about that kid's self-esteem.

359
00:20:37,537 --> 00:20:39,971
<i>On the next Arrested Development.</i>

360
00:20:42,175 --> 00:20:44,871
Yoo-hoo!
I'll take you the rest of the way!

361
00:20:44,978 --> 00:20:48,744
<i>Lucille finds a housekeeper
that she won't lose her son to.</i>

362
00:20:48,849 --> 00:20:53,684
Always keep from crying
even though your heart is dying

363
00:20:59,693 --> 00:21:02,560
<i>And Steve Holt finally
tracks down his real father.</i>

364
00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:05,062
I've been wonderin'
my whole life who he is-

365
00:21:05,165 --> 00:21:08,100
a scientist,
a doctor, a senator?

366
00:21:08,201 --> 00:21:11,261
Well, we got some bad news.

367
00:21:11,371 --> 00:21:15,899
Wow. Is that what's
gonna happen to my hair?
