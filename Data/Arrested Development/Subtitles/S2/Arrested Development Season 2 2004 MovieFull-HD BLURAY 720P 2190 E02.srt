1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:04,421
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:04,523 --> 00:00:06,548
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:06,658 --> 00:00:08,626
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:14,233 --> 00:00:15,791
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

5
00:00:19,538 --> 00:00:22,871
<i>Michael Bluth was at home
working on a plan to save the company.</i>

6
00:00:22,975 --> 00:00:26,877
How's this for a business model?
We make the company look like it's in the black...

7
00:00:26,979 --> 00:00:29,106
by starting construction
on the phase two development.

8
00:00:29,214 --> 00:00:31,114
I know what you're thinking,
we're not in the black.

9
00:00:31,216 --> 00:00:33,707
How're we gonna build 30 houses without
any money? We don't. We build one-

10
00:00:33,819 --> 00:00:37,721
then we have a huge ribbon-cutting ceremony
while raising funds for the others.

11
00:00:37,823 --> 00:00:41,122
<i>Michael's father always
unveiled his construction projects...</i>

12
00:00:41,226 --> 00:00:44,423
<i>with a highly publicized
ribbon-cutting ceremony.</i>

13
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:46,760
<i>He even did so
for the prison he built...</i>

14
00:00:46,865 --> 00:00:49,561
<i>and, somewhat ironically,
would later occupy.</i>

15
00:00:49,668 --> 00:00:53,434
The only difference is this time
I get to cut the ribbon. What do you think?

16
00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:55,632
There's a cream
with real diamonds in it.

17
00:00:55,741 --> 00:00:59,575
I can actually smear diamonds on my face,
and it's only $400 a tub.

18
00:00:59,678 --> 00:01:03,170
That's like, what, like
a million diamonds for $400?

19
00:01:03,282 --> 00:01:05,580
- Mm.
- A million- diamonds.

20
00:01:05,684 --> 00:01:09,245
<i>- Okay.
- Is she on you about that diamond cream?</i>

21
00:01:09,354 --> 00:01:11,982
<i>My husband's jealous because since
we decided to have an open marriage...</i>

22
00:01:12,091 --> 00:01:14,082
I've been doing
a little better than he has.

23
00:01:14,193 --> 00:01:16,320
It is not a competition, Lindsay.

24
00:01:16,428 --> 00:01:18,760
We are doing this
to save our marriage.

25
00:01:18,864 --> 00:01:22,630
<i>But I should be telling you that I have
been meeting my fair share of groupies.</i>

26
00:01:22,734 --> 00:01:25,294
Or should I say "Bluepies"?

27
00:01:25,404 --> 00:01:27,599
<i>Tobias had recently
auditioned as an understudy...</i>

28
00:01:27,706 --> 00:01:30,470
<i>for the silent performance
art trio, the Blue Man Group.</i>

29
00:01:30,576 --> 00:01:35,206
<i>And this is "Kids" from Bye, Bye, Birdie.</i>

30
00:01:36,515 --> 00:01:38,949
<i>He had yet to hear back from them.</i>

31
00:01:39,051 --> 00:01:42,543
You guys really think you have the guts to go
through with this "seeing other people" thing?

32
00:01:42,654 --> 00:01:46,556
<i>In fact, neither Lindsay nor
Tobias did have the guts to go through with it.</i>

33
00:01:46,658 --> 00:01:48,558
- I already have.
- I have too.

34
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,787
Can I buy you a drink?

35
00:01:50,896 --> 00:01:53,990
<i>No.
- Lindsay, because
she'd lost her self-confidence.</i>

36
00:01:54,099 --> 00:01:57,068
I'd like to buy you a drink.
Where's she going?

37
00:01:57,169 --> 00:02:00,696
<i>And Tobias, because
he was busy keeping an eye on Lindsay.</i>

38
00:02:00,806 --> 00:02:03,240
Who are you gonna bring
to this ribbon-cutting dance?

39
00:02:03,342 --> 00:02:07,472
It's not a dance, and you don't need a date.
Although, George Michael...

40
00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:10,377
I'd love for you to come with me
when I cut the ribbon at the new house.

41
00:02:10,482 --> 00:02:12,416
Oh, wow.
Hey, can I bring Ann?

42
00:02:12,518 --> 00:02:14,213
Who?

43
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,686
Ann. You know, she's- she's the girl
I'm kinda hanging out with.

44
00:02:17,789 --> 00:02:19,313
- I haven't met Ann.
- Yes, you have.

45
00:02:19,424 --> 00:02:22,723
<i>- Michael had met Ann.
- You let her in.</i>

46
00:02:23,929 --> 00:02:26,830
See, that's her right over there.

47
00:02:26,932 --> 00:02:28,832
<i>- Oh, Ann. Yes, yes, yes, yes.
- Yeah.</i>

48
00:02:28,934 --> 00:02:33,166
I know Ann. Hey, you!
She's got a little hard-boiled egg going there.

49
00:02:33,272 --> 00:02:35,934
Oh, it's so cute. She sometimes takes
a little pack of mayonnaise...

50
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:38,407
and she'll squirt it in her mouth,
and then she'll take an egg...

51
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,671
and kind of- mmm.

52
00:02:40,779 --> 00:02:43,577
She calls it a mayonn-egg.

53
00:02:43,682 --> 00:02:45,775
- Are you okay?
- I don't feel so good.

54
00:02:45,884 --> 00:02:48,512
You know, I kind of wanna
buy her a diamond.

55
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,350
- Her?
- Ann.

56
00:02:51,456 --> 00:02:54,391
I know I can't afford it, but Aunt Lindsay
was telling me about this diamond cream.

57
00:02:54,493 --> 00:02:59,123
George Michael, um, I'm sure that Egg is
a very nice person. I just don't want you spending-

58
00:02:59,231 --> 00:03:02,564
- It's Ann. Her na-
- all your money getting her
all glittered up for Easter.

59
00:03:02,668 --> 00:03:04,693
You know? More importantly,
I want us to do this together.

60
00:03:04,803 --> 00:03:07,203
Kinda like a father-son
sort of thing, you know?

61
00:03:07,306 --> 00:03:10,707
And since Pop-Pop is no longer president,
we get to do it.

62
00:03:10,809 --> 00:03:14,370
- I thought Gob was president.
- Yeah, and I don't have any problem with that.

63
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:17,346
<i>In fact,
since Michael's father escaped from prison...</i>

64
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:21,442
<i>his brother Gob had been made president,
albeit in name only.</i>

65
00:03:21,553 --> 00:03:25,011
<i>Which is why Michael was surprised
when he got to work the next day.</i>

66
00:03:25,123 --> 00:03:28,115
- You're still in my office.
- Gosh, Michael, I am kind of the president.

67
00:03:28,227 --> 00:03:30,787
And I have no problem with that.
But it is just a title, remember?

68
00:03:30,896 --> 00:03:34,491
Just doing this to appease the stockholders,
while they scrutinize me for Dad's crimes.

69
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,730
Hey, Dad may have illegally built some homes
in Iraq, which is kinda not cool.

70
00:03:38,837 --> 00:03:40,828
I know, but that's why
I've got a business model...

71
00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:43,567
that I think is going
to restore the image of our company.

72
00:03:43,675 --> 00:03:45,575
We're going to build
a second model home.

73
00:03:45,677 --> 00:03:47,736
That's great.
Can I announce it to the board?

74
00:03:47,846 --> 00:03:49,780
Gee, it is my business model.

75
00:03:49,881 --> 00:03:52,748
If you had a business model, then by all means,
go in there and do your little dance.

76
00:03:52,851 --> 00:03:54,842
Tell you what we're gonna do.
Rock, paper, scissors for it.

77
00:03:54,953 --> 00:03:57,444
- No, no, I'm not interested in doing-
- One, two, three.

78
00:03:57,556 --> 00:04:00,787
- Paper covers rock.
- It is a rock though. It should beat everything.

79
00:04:00,892 --> 00:04:05,124
There's not a lot of logic to it. It's like
on a boat with "Women and children first."

80
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,927
Why should they-which, before I forget,
I'm buying a company boat.

81
00:04:09,034 --> 00:04:10,934
Sorry?

82
00:04:11,036 --> 00:04:14,437
<i>That morning, Gob had gone to a
boat show, where he saw something he wanted.</i>

83
00:04:14,539 --> 00:04:16,939
- Hello.
- Hi.

84
00:04:17,042 --> 00:04:18,976
- What a beauty.
- Thank you.

85
00:04:19,077 --> 00:04:21,443
- I meant you.
- Well.

86
00:04:21,546 --> 00:04:24,947
<i>Gob flirted with her
for a while, and finally asked for her number.</i>

87
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:29,111
- Let's get some digits.
- I'm sorry. I don't give it out without a firm offer.

88
00:04:29,221 --> 00:04:32,054
Oh, I'll make you a firm offer.

89
00:04:32,157 --> 00:04:34,182
<i>Unfortunately, she wasn't flirting.</i>

90
00:04:34,293 --> 00:04:37,729
And here again, please.

91
00:04:37,829 --> 00:04:40,662
- The Seaward.
- You're not getting a boat.

92
00:04:40,766 --> 00:04:43,667
- One, two, three.
- No, not gonna do it.

93
00:04:43,769 --> 00:04:46,294
- Paper covers rock.
- Fine. But rock sinks boat.

94
00:04:46,405 --> 00:04:48,930
- Michael?
- Mom, I'm right in the middle of something.

95
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:52,374
- Get rid of the Seaward.
- I'll leave when I'm good and ready.

96
00:04:54,179 --> 00:04:57,808
<i>It's about your Uncle Oscar.
I want him to move in with you.</i>

97
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,975
You're not kicking him out
already, are you?

98
00:05:00,085 --> 00:05:03,350
<i>Michael's uncle
had recently moved into Lucille's apartment...</i>

99
00:05:03,455 --> 00:05:06,913
<i>where they quickly rekindled
a long-dormant romance.</i>

100
00:05:07,025 --> 00:05:10,153
<i>- It was a secret she hoped to keep-
- Oscar, we'll be heard.</i>

101
00:05:10,262 --> 00:05:12,730
<i>- and he didn't.
- That's what makes it so hot.</i>

102
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:15,061
<i>Mother?</i>

103
00:05:15,167 --> 00:05:16,691
<i>Mother!</i>

104
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:21,171
- I heard zoo noises.
- It's nothing. Go back to bed.

105
00:05:21,273 --> 00:05:24,265
<i>So, everybody's still up, huh?</i>

106
00:05:29,114 --> 00:05:31,674
It's not fair to Buster.
He's a nervous wreck right now.

107
00:05:31,783 --> 00:05:34,377
He's going into the army,
for God's sake.

108
00:05:34,486 --> 00:05:36,852
You volunteered him.

109
00:05:36,955 --> 00:05:40,186
I knew you were going to
throw that in my face.

110
00:05:40,292 --> 00:05:42,522
Don't worry about it, okay?
They're never gonna take him anyway.

111
00:05:42,627 --> 00:05:45,994
<i>At that moment, Buster was taking
his physical at the recruitment center.</i>

112
00:05:46,098 --> 00:05:49,397
I don't have a hole in my heart.
I've never opened my eyes underwater.

113
00:05:49,501 --> 00:05:51,526
My-
Reproductive organ...

114
00:05:51,636 --> 00:05:53,866
is shaped like-
a lobster tail...

115
00:05:53,972 --> 00:05:56,372
but without its shell, hmm?

116
00:05:56,475 --> 00:05:58,670
Oh, I guess I have the panic attacks
under control.

117
00:05:58,777 --> 00:06:01,302
Oh, and I'm legally blind at night.

118
00:06:01,413 --> 00:06:05,042
<i>But Buster had miscalculated
the army's current need for personnel.</i>

119
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:07,050
Okay, then, let's get you fitted
for a uniform.

120
00:06:07,152 --> 00:06:09,712
What? What?

121
00:06:09,821 --> 00:06:12,415
Hey, why don't you volunteer Oscar?
That would solve both of your problems.

122
00:06:12,524 --> 00:06:14,651
He'd never cut his hair.

123
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,751
That hair.

124
00:06:16,862 --> 00:06:19,990
Listen, Oscar's your problem. I'm taking care
of everything else in this family...

125
00:06:20,098 --> 00:06:23,625
including starting construction
on a second model home.

126
00:06:23,735 --> 00:06:26,067
We're having
a ribbon-cutting ceremony.

127
00:06:26,171 --> 00:06:29,572
We can't have a ribbon-cutting
without your father, and he's God knows where.

128
00:06:29,674 --> 00:06:31,938
<i>George Sr. Was in Mexico...</i>

129
00:06:32,043 --> 00:06:34,068
<i>with his escape accomplice
and ex-secretary, Kitty.</i>

130
00:06:34,179 --> 00:06:38,980
I keep eating so many eggs. It must be
my unconscious desire to have a baby.

131
00:06:39,084 --> 00:06:43,077
Oh, my God. Can you even imagine how cute
the combination of the two of us would be?

132
00:06:44,523 --> 00:06:48,050
I mean, we're all out of
"prophylacticos" anyway.

133
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,096
Somebody used the last two on his feet
to walk across the bathroom floor.

134
00:06:52,197 --> 00:06:55,064
<i>But he was growing tired
of their confined intimacy.</i>

135
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:57,931
- I've made a huge mistake.
- Hey, it's me.

136
00:06:58,036 --> 00:07:00,664
- Dad?
- Yeah. Listen, I gotta make this quick.

137
00:07:00,772 --> 00:07:04,299
You're the only one who can save the family,
but you gotta keep the company strong...

138
00:07:04,409 --> 00:07:06,434
because I'm gonna need
some of that money later.

139
00:07:06,545 --> 00:07:08,809
I will, Dad. It's funny,
after all these years of...

140
00:07:08,914 --> 00:07:11,940
- you making fun of me for the magic shows and-
- Gob!

141
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,383
Oh, for God's- I called to talk to Michael,
you horse's-

142
00:07:17,856 --> 00:07:20,188
<i>- Gob was hurt.
- Bye, Pop.</i>

143
00:07:20,292 --> 00:07:23,056
Hey, whoa, whoa, was that Dad?

144
00:07:23,161 --> 00:07:25,561
Yeah, I had to, uh, jump off.

145
00:07:25,664 --> 00:07:27,791
You just had Dad on the phone?
Where was he?

146
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:29,799
No way to tell, really.
Portugal.

147
00:07:29,901 --> 00:07:32,392
<i>- Down South America way.
- Well, did he wanna talk to me?</i>

148
00:07:32,504 --> 00:07:35,803
No, he wanted to talk
to the president.

149
00:07:35,907 --> 00:07:39,468
<i>- I have no problem with that.
- Michael was also hurt.</i>

150
00:07:39,578 --> 00:07:41,705
<i>And George Sr.
Was brutally hurt...</i>

151
00:07:41,813 --> 00:07:44,304
<i>when he was mistaken
for his twin brother Oscar.</i>

152
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:46,543
<i>Marijuana? No, no.</i>

153
00:07:46,651 --> 00:07:49,677
That's my brother.
"Brothero. Brothero."

154
00:07:52,357 --> 00:07:54,257
<i>That night, Lindsay headed to the club...</i>

155
00:07:54,359 --> 00:07:56,293
<i>to try again to meet someone.</i>

156
00:08:02,934 --> 00:08:06,700
<i>Soon, having struck out again,
she spotted a man who looked interesting.</i>

157
00:08:06,805 --> 00:08:09,205
<i>He had the lean look,
effortless hair...</i>

158
00:08:09,307 --> 00:08:11,366
<i>and dressed-down manner
of a movie star.</i>

159
00:08:11,476 --> 00:08:14,707
- Buy me a drink?
- I think the bar's closing.

160
00:08:14,813 --> 00:08:16,940
I know a place.

161
00:08:19,684 --> 00:08:22,847
<i>It was at that point
that Lindsay had a startling revelation.</i>

162
00:08:22,954 --> 00:08:25,821
Uh, uh, uh, you get out.
Get out. Get out. Out, out, out!

163
00:08:25,924 --> 00:08:29,360
- No homeless in here!
- Homeless? You're homeless?

164
00:08:29,461 --> 00:08:32,953
You're gross. Oh, God.

165
00:08:38,803 --> 00:08:41,704
They're taking me in the army. They didn't
think there was enough wrong with me.

166
00:08:41,806 --> 00:08:44,468
Well, did they check everything?

167
00:08:44,576 --> 00:08:48,535
Yes. They even touched my Charlie Browns.
You lied to me.

168
00:08:48,647 --> 00:08:50,706
- You said I wasn't fit to serve.
- Okay, hold on.

169
00:08:50,815 --> 00:08:52,715
Let's calm down, people.

170
00:08:52,817 --> 00:08:55,945
Um, I think I know a little bit
about avoiding combat duty.

171
00:08:56,054 --> 00:08:58,386
Now which pinkie do you use less?

172
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:01,789
Are you nuts? Do you know
what I went through to have this boy?

173
00:09:01,893 --> 00:09:05,420
Oh, I know where the boy came from.

174
00:09:07,566 --> 00:09:10,057
Wait.
Why were you in the pantry?

175
00:09:11,436 --> 00:09:13,563
<i>And Lucille realized
it was time to end...</i>

176
00:09:13,672 --> 00:09:15,572
<i>whatever it was
she had with Oscar.</i>

177
00:09:15,674 --> 00:09:17,574
So, I believe it's a good plan.

178
00:09:17,676 --> 00:09:21,168
<i>The next day, Michael was ready to wow
the board with his new business model.</i>

179
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,509
As I told my brother,
the president...

180
00:09:23,615 --> 00:09:25,640
if we start construction
on a second model home...

181
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,150
we can be cutting this ribbon
within two months.

182
00:09:29,454 --> 00:09:33,584
I said, "That's why you're
no longer president."

183
00:09:33,692 --> 00:09:38,288
Two weeks.
Let's do it in two weeks. Hey!

184
00:09:41,866 --> 00:09:44,596
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Can we stop the music?

185
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:47,137
<i>I'm not as optimistic that we can get that done.</i>

186
00:09:47,238 --> 00:09:50,401
Gob, I think we both agree
that we would do things your way...

187
00:09:50,508 --> 00:09:52,772
if you had a business model.

188
00:09:52,877 --> 00:09:55,471
Do you have
a business model, Gob?

189
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,980
I am so happy
that you asked me that, Michael...

190
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:01,951
because I just happen
to have a business model right here.

191
00:10:02,053 --> 00:10:04,886
<i>Solid as a rock</i>

192
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:08,391
Meet Starla, the new Bluth Company
business model...

193
00:10:08,493 --> 00:10:10,552
<i>for our phase two campaign.</i>

194
00:10:10,662 --> 00:10:13,961
Solid as a rock.

195
00:10:14,065 --> 00:10:17,228
We'll see you at the ribbon-cutting
in two weeks...

196
00:10:17,335 --> 00:10:19,895
if my brother doesn't
screw it up first.

197
00:10:21,106 --> 00:10:24,041
- Hey!

198
00:10:25,844 --> 00:10:30,144
<i>Gob had committed Michael
to building a model home in two weeks.</i>

199
00:10:30,248 --> 00:10:34,412
We can't build a house in two weeks.
Also, I'm not sure how "Solid as a Rock"...

200
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:37,545
helps people forget the fact
that we built houses in Iraq.

201
00:10:37,656 --> 00:10:39,988
- I love that.
- But you probably know best
because you're president.

202
00:10:40,091 --> 00:10:41,991
We don't have to build
a real house, Michael.

203
00:10:42,093 --> 00:10:45,585
Like you said, it's all for appearances anyway.
We throw up a couple of walls.

204
00:10:45,697 --> 00:10:47,665
- We build a fake one.
- What are you talking about?

205
00:10:47,766 --> 00:10:50,326
Nothing on the inside.

206
00:10:50,435 --> 00:10:53,029
I'll never get a crew to build it.
They'd lose their licenses.

207
00:10:53,138 --> 00:10:55,436
Then you build it
yourself, damn it!

208
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:59,237
Hey, there she is,
my little business model.

209
00:11:02,147 --> 00:11:04,741
Sorry about that
"build it yourself' crap.

210
00:11:04,849 --> 00:11:06,578
I might take her
to the ribbon-cutting.

211
00:11:06,685 --> 00:11:08,949
- You end up finding a date yet?
- No.

212
00:11:09,054 --> 00:11:12,182
<i>As Michael grew frustrated
by his relationship with Gob...</i>

213
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:14,952
<i>Lucille tried to end hers
with Oscar.</i>

214
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,551
- I want you out of the house.
- Oh, I want you everywhere.

215
00:11:17,662 --> 00:11:21,928
Oscar, no. I can't have this in my life
anymore. I'm a married woman.

216
00:11:22,033 --> 00:11:24,194
Lucille, you wanna leave?
I won't chase after you.

217
00:11:24,302 --> 00:11:26,964
But before you do, ask yourself,
"Where's your husband?"

218
00:11:27,072 --> 00:11:31,099
Because I am here. I am real.
I am flesh and blood.

219
00:11:31,209 --> 00:11:33,109
<i>And hair.</i>

220
00:11:33,211 --> 00:11:36,078
Oh, God, that hair.

221
00:11:36,181 --> 00:11:38,672
What will people say?

222
00:11:38,783 --> 00:11:42,014
They'll say,
"Those people are in love."

223
00:11:44,355 --> 00:11:47,415
<i>That night, the evening news
report said something very different.</i>

224
00:11:47,525 --> 00:11:51,894
Lucille Bluth, caught on tape
breathing life into a homeless man.

225
00:11:51,996 --> 00:11:54,897
The surprising home video
at 10:00.

226
00:11:54,999 --> 00:11:56,967
<i>And Michael prepared to build a house.</i>

227
00:11:57,068 --> 00:11:59,559
Two weeks?
But what if my date's not available?

228
00:11:59,671 --> 00:12:02,663
I'm trying to get a last-minute crew together.
Your inability to get a man interested...

229
00:12:02,774 --> 00:12:05,675
- is not at the top of my list.
- Oh, I've got a man interested, Michael.

230
00:12:05,777 --> 00:12:07,938
- What's wrong with him?
- There's nothing wrong with him.

231
00:12:09,114 --> 00:12:11,776
He is homeless.

232
00:12:11,883 --> 00:12:14,078
Well, I didn't know
he was homeless at the time.

233
00:12:14,185 --> 00:12:16,915
- It was humiliating.
- Is this about Gangy's homeless guy?

234
00:12:17,021 --> 00:12:19,683
- Gangy's homeless guy?
- Yeah, it's all over the news.

235
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:23,420
Gangy gave C.P.R.
To a homeless guy on the beach.

236
00:12:23,528 --> 00:12:25,462
<i>Lindsay felt respect for her mother...</i>

237
00:12:25,563 --> 00:12:29,431
<i>and decided that perhaps she could overcome
her pride and help someone too.</i>

238
00:12:29,534 --> 00:12:34,369
I've got someone for your crew, Michael.
My boyfriend, the homeless guy.

239
00:12:34,472 --> 00:12:37,805
I wonder if he even has an apartment or-

240
00:12:37,909 --> 00:12:40,639
- Hello.
- Did you see the news?

241
00:12:40,745 --> 00:12:43,475
Your Uncle Oscar forced himself on me
at the beach today...

242
00:12:43,581 --> 00:12:45,947
- and I didn't have my horn.
- Of course.

243
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:48,780
It was Uncle Oscar. Mom,
you're not having an affair with him, are you?

244
00:12:48,887 --> 00:12:51,447
You're building a house?
I want you to give it to him.

245
00:12:51,556 --> 00:12:54,787
- It's not a real house.
- Perfect. He's not a real man.

246
00:12:54,893 --> 00:12:57,657
<i>And George Sr.
Made his case to the Mexican police.</i>

247
00:12:57,762 --> 00:13:00,890
<i>My God, I was beaten up here. I'm telling you.
I'm George. I'm not Oscar. I'm George.</i>

248
00:13:00,999 --> 00:13:05,231
<i>- The Cornballer.
- Ssí. The Cornballer.</i>

249
00:13:05,336 --> 00:13:10,137
<i>George Sr. Had marketed
a device called the Cornballer in Mexico...</i>

250
00:13:10,241 --> 00:13:13,506
<i>after the severe burns
it caused led to it being banned in the U.S.</i>

251
00:13:13,611 --> 00:13:17,308
<i>- Why, did you have one?
- Ssí.</i>

252
00:13:21,619 --> 00:13:24,179
<i>Lindsay, meanwhile,
was having trouble finding her homeless man.</i>

253
00:13:24,289 --> 00:13:28,749
<i>- He looked like a movie star.
- The man looked like a movie star
because he was a movie star.</i>

254
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,591
<i>His name was Tom Jane, and he was making
two movies for a major studio.</i>

255
00:13:32,697 --> 00:13:35,791
<i>One was a gritty personal project
about a junkie's life...</i>

256
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,562
<i>which he got to do
in exchange for making...</i>

257
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:41,230
<i>a rigidly, formulaic popcorn movie.</i>

258
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:43,830
<i>- He was living on the streets, researching his role.
- Hey, homeless guy.</i>

259
00:13:43,942 --> 00:13:46,536
- Hey.
- I'm not proud of the way...

260
00:13:46,644 --> 00:13:49,078
I was so grossed out when I found out
you were gross before.

261
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,080
You really thought
I was gross, huh?

262
00:13:51,182 --> 00:13:55,278
Well, at first, I thought you were kind of hot,
but I hadn't looked closely enough.

263
00:13:55,386 --> 00:13:58,253
Listen, I have
a construction job for you.

264
00:13:58,356 --> 00:14:02,725
And if you clean yourself up, who knows?
You might actually get a date out of this.

265
00:14:04,362 --> 00:14:08,025
- Okay.
- See ya.

266
00:14:12,704 --> 00:14:16,800
Okay, we've all made some sacrifices to be here,
but we all want the same thing.

267
00:14:16,908 --> 00:14:19,934
- I wanna live here.
- I wanna buy Ann some diamond dust.

268
00:14:20,044 --> 00:14:23,411
<i>I'm just hoping to get mildly injured,
so I can get out of the army.</i>

269
00:14:23,514 --> 00:14:25,880
Bottom line is we've got two weeks
to build a house.

270
00:14:25,984 --> 00:14:28,145
It doesn't have to be good.
It just has to look good.

271
00:14:28,253 --> 00:14:30,448
I just want my kids back.

272
00:14:32,423 --> 00:14:34,482
<i>And so, the guys went to work.</i>

273
00:14:39,364 --> 00:14:42,822
<i>Things didn't go smoothly at first.</i>

274
00:14:44,102 --> 00:14:46,764
<i>Buster looked for ways
to hurt himself.</i>

275
00:14:51,542 --> 00:14:56,104
<i>But soon the project came together-
when Gob stopped by.</i>

276
00:14:57,682 --> 00:14:59,582
<i>Now we're building a house.</i>

277
00:14:59,684 --> 00:15:03,085
- Yeah, I'm pretty proud-
- So, what do you think? Did I do this or what?

278
00:15:03,187 --> 00:15:05,087
Seems like your brother did it.

279
00:15:05,189 --> 00:15:07,453
My brother does what I tell him to do.
I'm the president.

280
00:15:07,558 --> 00:15:09,958
Where's your "P"?

281
00:15:10,061 --> 00:15:12,689
What?
Oh, no, not again.

282
00:15:12,797 --> 00:15:14,765
I got it.

283
00:15:14,866 --> 00:15:18,358
Hey, sorry for the "my brother does
what I tell him to do" crap...

284
00:15:18,469 --> 00:15:20,699
but I want this to be perfect
for when I cut the ribbon tomorrow.

285
00:15:20,805 --> 00:15:22,705
You're cutting the ribbon?

286
00:15:22,807 --> 00:15:25,139
I kinda thought
that since I built it...

287
00:15:25,243 --> 00:15:27,438
- I might go ahead and give it a-
- Yeah, okay.

288
00:15:27,545 --> 00:15:30,013
Can you imagine how
that would look to the board?

289
00:15:30,114 --> 00:15:34,448
The construction worker cutting the ribbon.
No, no, that's a job for the president.

290
00:15:34,552 --> 00:15:37,146
<i>Michael had a problem with that.</i>

291
00:15:37,255 --> 00:15:39,587
<i>- Gob had taken away something
Michael always wanted.
- You got the "P."</i>

292
00:15:39,691 --> 00:15:43,491
<i>Now it was Michael's turn
to take something from Gob- Starla.</i>

293
00:15:43,594 --> 00:15:47,963
<i>And later, Michael
set about his plan.</i>

294
00:15:48,066 --> 00:15:49,966
Gob, do you have
Starla's phone number?

295
00:15:50,068 --> 00:15:52,628
<i>I got a few business things
I'd like to go over with the business model.</i>

296
00:15:52,737 --> 00:15:56,833
<i>Guess who was just over her?
Don't, I'll tell you- me.</i>

297
00:15:56,941 --> 00:15:59,637
- Hmm?
- L- the business model.

298
00:15:59,744 --> 00:16:01,371
<i>Actually, theyjust made out.</i>

299
00:16:01,479 --> 00:16:04,312
Yeah, she had
all kinds of orgasms.

300
00:16:04,415 --> 00:16:07,316
Imagine that. I finally nailed
somebody that you weren't after.

301
00:16:07,418 --> 00:16:11,184
That's it. I've worked too hard and too long
for you to keep getting all the credit.

302
00:16:11,289 --> 00:16:13,553
I built that company, that house,
and I'm gonna be cutting the ribbon...

303
00:16:13,658 --> 00:16:16,354
whether we're all pretending
that you're president or not.

304
00:16:16,461 --> 00:16:18,486
Yeah, sure.
I just wanted-

305
00:16:18,596 --> 00:16:22,828
- You just wanted what?
- I just wanted you to be impressed with me.

306
00:16:22,934 --> 00:16:26,870
Dad never was.
Never said a nice thing about me.

307
00:16:26,971 --> 00:16:29,667
He called you the other day.
He didn't even wanna talk to me.

308
00:16:29,774 --> 00:16:33,904
Of course he did!
He never wants to talk to me. He never has.

309
00:16:39,183 --> 00:16:41,083
- Cut the ribbon.
- Really?

310
00:16:41,185 --> 00:16:42,880
- Yeah. How about that?
- Michael.

311
00:16:42,987 --> 00:16:44,955
I have no problem with it.

312
00:16:45,056 --> 00:16:48,958
- All right? Take it easy. Come on.
- Thank you.

313
00:16:50,862 --> 00:16:54,696
<i>The next day, the Bluth family
prepared to unveil phase two.</i>

314
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:57,097
Have you seen your Uncle Gob around?

315
00:16:57,201 --> 00:17:00,102
No. And I can't find that diamond dust
that Aunt Lindsay bought for me.

316
00:17:00,204 --> 00:17:03,469
Oh, well, your Aunt Lindsay has probably taken it.
She's just a taker.

317
00:17:03,574 --> 00:17:06,372
This is your chance, huh?
With the big ribbon-cutters after all these years?

318
00:17:06,477 --> 00:17:08,604
Well, actually, I figured,
give Gob a chance, you know?

319
00:17:08,713 --> 00:17:11,204
The guy doesn't get
a whole lot of attention in this family.

320
00:17:11,315 --> 00:17:16,810
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the president
of the Bluth Company, Gob Bluth.</i>

321
00:17:19,457 --> 00:17:21,982
My brother wasn't optimistic
it could be done.

322
00:17:22,093 --> 00:17:26,154
<i>But I didn't take "wasn't optimistic
it could be done"...</i>

323
00:17:26,264 --> 00:17:28,164
<i>for an answer.</i>

324
00:17:30,435 --> 00:17:34,235
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you
phase two of the Bluth Company.</i>

325
00:17:34,338 --> 00:17:38,240
A house truly solid as a rock.

326
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,741
<i>But as it turns out...</i>

327
00:17:44,849 --> 00:17:49,013
<i>Michael was right to not be optimistic
it could be done.</i>

328
00:17:51,556 --> 00:17:55,322
<i>And Buster
saw the chance to get injured enough...</i>

329
00:17:55,426 --> 00:17:57,326
<i>to keep him out of the army.</i>

330
00:17:59,464 --> 00:18:03,594
<i>But instead...</i>

331
00:18:03,701 --> 00:18:06,101
<i>- got a glimpse inside.
- I can't look at that.</i>

332
00:18:06,204 --> 00:18:08,104
<i>Unfortunately, Tobias had to.</i>

333
00:18:08,206 --> 00:18:11,767
I got the wrong homeless man.
I am sorry. I was looking for Lindsay.

334
00:18:11,876 --> 00:18:15,937
<i>You lied to me.
You both lied to me. I'm goin'to war.</i>

335
00:18:16,047 --> 00:18:19,346
- Buster, you can't!
- Yes, I can.

336
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:21,941
I don't agree
with your dirty doings here...

337
00:18:22,053 --> 00:18:24,681
but I will defend with my life
your right to do it.

338
00:18:26,424 --> 00:18:28,858
<i>You planned this all along,
didn't you, Michael?</i>

339
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,793
- No, I didn't. I had no crew. I had no time.
- You set me up.

340
00:18:31,896 --> 00:18:34,660
<i>Gob charged
at Michael with the scissors...</i>

341
00:18:34,765 --> 00:18:37,632
<i>but Michael,
as he always did, picked rock-</i>

342
00:18:37,735 --> 00:18:40,033
<i>- You wanted to make me look foolish!
- Put down the scissors.</i>

343
00:18:40,138 --> 00:18:42,868
- Put 'em down.
- Foolish with scissors!

344
00:18:42,974 --> 00:18:45,204
<i>Which beat scissors.</i>

345
00:18:47,111 --> 00:18:50,205
<i>Unfortunately, the whole incident
was covered by the paper.</i>

346
00:18:50,314 --> 00:18:52,214
Nobody looks good in this.

347
00:18:52,316 --> 00:18:55,774
- Especially that little dude.
- That's Ann.

348
00:18:55,887 --> 00:18:57,878
- Who's-
- It doesn't matter. Listen.

349
00:18:57,989 --> 00:19:01,390
You know I didn't set you up, okay?
I think the only reason you and I always fight...

350
00:19:01,492 --> 00:19:04,154
is that since we were little kids,
Dad's always played us off each other.

351
00:19:04,262 --> 00:19:06,696
Dad always said
that was your fault.

352
00:19:06,797 --> 00:19:08,992
Anyway, what we oughta do
is make a decision right now...

353
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,227
not to let Dad get in the middle
of our relationship anymore.

354
00:19:11,335 --> 00:19:13,735
- He's not even in town, and we're fighting.
- We're grown men.

355
00:19:13,838 --> 00:19:17,239
- Yeah, let's just move on.
- Look at me. I'm the president of a company now.

356
00:19:17,341 --> 00:19:20,367
Oh, that's Dad's line. I bet he saw the paper.

357
00:19:20,478 --> 00:19:23,413
Listen, if you want my respect,
you won't answer that, okay?

358
00:19:23,514 --> 00:19:25,414
It's just gonna
cause more problems.

359
00:19:27,785 --> 00:19:31,915
Hello? They hung up.

360
00:19:32,023 --> 00:19:34,287
They hung up on me.
Hiya, guys.

361
00:19:34,392 --> 00:19:36,587
I couldn't get the money.
I don't know what happened.

362
00:19:36,694 --> 00:19:38,594
- I'm impressed you hung up.
- Did I hang up?

363
00:19:38,696 --> 00:19:40,926
- I meant to hit speaker.
- Oh.

364
00:19:41,032 --> 00:19:43,364
- You gotta hit the line first.
- I'm hitting both at the same time.

365
00:19:43,467 --> 00:19:45,526
- These are the lines. There's a line here.
- But she said-

366
00:19:45,636 --> 00:19:47,536
- It's line and then-
- Hey.

367
00:19:47,638 --> 00:19:50,607
I don't wanna wait until Dad's dead
for us to get along.

368
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:53,074
<i>But it was too late...</i>

369
00:19:53,177 --> 00:19:56,044
<i>as George Sr. Would be declared dead...</i>

370
00:19:56,147 --> 00:19:58,377
<i>within the hour.</i>

371
00:19:58,482 --> 00:20:01,315
- From now on, we support each other.
- We start with a clean slate.

372
00:20:01,419 --> 00:20:04,582
- Yeah.
- We almost did it though, didn't we?

373
00:20:04,689 --> 00:20:07,055
We almost pulled it off.

374
00:20:07,158 --> 00:20:09,786
- No, it wasn't even close.
- Yeah, a lot of people got hurt.

375
00:20:09,894 --> 00:20:12,385
- This was very, very bad.
- Not great. Not great.

376
00:20:12,496 --> 00:20:15,431
<i>On the next Arrested Development.</i>

377
00:20:15,533 --> 00:20:18,934
<i>Lindsay finds out the true identity
ofher homeless man.</i>

378
00:20:19,036 --> 00:20:23,132
Look. You're a really nice chick,
but I'm not homeless.

379
00:20:23,241 --> 00:20:25,334
I'm Tom Jane.

380
00:20:25,443 --> 00:20:27,468
<i>And even though Lindsay
doesn't know who that is...</i>

381
00:20:27,578 --> 00:20:29,842
<i>hearing that he isn't homeless
is good enough for her.</i>

382
00:20:29,947 --> 00:20:34,281
- Buy me a drink?
- You're really sweet, but, no.

383
00:20:34,385 --> 00:20:36,285
I'm Tom Jane.

384
00:20:36,387 --> 00:20:38,821
<i>And Lindsay, crushed and alone...</i>

385
00:20:38,923 --> 00:20:41,892
<i>for the first time
misses her husband.</i>

386
00:20:41,993 --> 00:20:46,930
Tobias.

387
00:20:47,031 --> 00:20:50,660
Lindsay, I'm-

388
00:20:50,768 --> 00:20:52,497
Is that George Michael's
diamond cream?

389
00:20:52,603 --> 00:20:56,095
Oh, yes, well, I ran out of blue,
and I couldn't find anything else.

390
00:20:56,207 --> 00:20:59,665
I think my nipples are bleeding though. I don't
know if you're supposed to use quite this much.

391
00:21:01,779 --> 00:21:04,509
- That guy's a jerk.
- No, I am.

392
00:21:04,615 --> 00:21:08,107
No, no, I am.

393
00:21:08,219 --> 00:21:10,483
Because I think I need
to go to the hospital right away...

394
00:21:10,588 --> 00:21:14,991
and see if I can't get some of this diamond dust
vacuumed from out of my lungs.

395
00:21:15,092 --> 00:21:16,719
This way.
