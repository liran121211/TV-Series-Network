1
00:00:01,012 --> 00:00:04,243
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:04,348 --> 00:00:06,509
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:06,617 --> 00:00:08,608
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:15,888
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

5
00:00:19,196 --> 00:00:22,063
<i>Michael was having brunch with Sally Sitwell.</i>

6
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:25,192
I still can't believe we got in.
This place is usually so packed on Sundays.

7
00:00:25,302 --> 00:00:27,998
<i>In addition to its Sunday popularity...</i>

8
00:00:28,105 --> 00:00:31,905
<i>the bistro was also famous
for something called the Skip's Scramble-</i>

9
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:34,375
<i>an egg dish that contained
everything on the menu.</i>

10
00:00:34,478 --> 00:00:36,946
<i>Don't order the Skip's Scramble.</i>

11
00:00:37,048 --> 00:00:40,950
<i>Just more good luck. Everything's been
going so well since we started goin'out.</i>

12
00:00:41,052 --> 00:00:43,452
I think we've actually
gone out eight times now.

13
00:00:43,554 --> 00:00:45,545
<i>Which included a record-tying...</i>

14
00:00:45,656 --> 00:00:48,056
<i>three lovemaking sessions
in one night for Michael.</i>

15
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:50,059
<i>- Yes!
- Just think...</i>

16
00:00:50,161 --> 00:00:53,824
how different everything in our lives would be
if we'd gotten together in high school.

17
00:00:53,931 --> 00:00:56,161
Of course, I wouldn't
have had George Michael.

18
00:00:56,267 --> 00:01:00,101
We probably would've had
an entirely different kind of child.

19
00:01:02,907 --> 00:01:05,569
I really hope
he's okay with us goin' out.

20
00:01:05,676 --> 00:01:07,940
We're very close.
We don't keep anything from each other.

21
00:01:08,045 --> 00:01:10,912
Oh, no, it's my Dad.
I'm supposed to be at work.

22
00:01:11,015 --> 00:01:13,609
You know, George Michael,
you worry too much.

23
00:01:13,717 --> 00:01:17,244
It's Sunday. You're allowed to
have a couple of hours off.

24
00:01:17,354 --> 00:01:20,619
You don't see me nervous
about being on my third Virgin Mary.

25
00:01:20,724 --> 00:01:23,192
Why would you be nervous?
There's no alcohol in a Virgin Mary.

26
00:01:23,294 --> 00:01:26,024
There isn't?
This is unbelievable.

27
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,121
Can I get a virgin piña colada
when you get a chance?

28
00:01:28,232 --> 00:01:30,200
Now we'll get
things started.

29
00:01:30,301 --> 00:01:33,202
<i>Hi. This is so, uh-
I was just-</i>

30
00:01:33,304 --> 00:01:35,295
Hey, okay.

31
00:01:35,406 --> 00:01:37,499
I want to introduce you to Sally.
This is George Michael.

32
00:01:37,608 --> 00:01:40,099
<i>- My niece, Maeby.
- It's nice to meet you.</i>

33
00:01:40,211 --> 00:01:42,611
I just shut down the banana stand
for a half an hour.

34
00:01:42,713 --> 00:01:45,113
- I can keep it open late tonight if you-
- No. Hey. Come on.

35
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:47,707
Make me sound like a taskmaster.

36
00:01:47,818 --> 00:01:51,049
But if- if you want to keep it open
an extra hour, you know.

37
00:01:51,155 --> 00:01:53,453
<i>So, this is Sally.</i>

38
00:01:53,557 --> 00:01:56,025
- Is she your girlfriend?
- No.

39
00:01:56,127 --> 00:01:58,618
- Yes!
- A little.

40
00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:01,823
<i>You know what? I'm gonna meet
you in a few minutes, okay?</i>

41
00:02:01,932 --> 00:02:04,560
- Okay.
- And maybe we'll work on
breaking that record, huh?

42
00:02:04,668 --> 00:02:07,228
Okay.

43
00:02:07,338 --> 00:02:09,636
She's a shot-putter.
And I'm dating her.

44
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:12,538
<i>But I just want to make sure
that you're comfortable with everything.</i>

45
00:02:12,643 --> 00:02:16,135
<i>Well, of course. We could double-date.
You and Sally and me and Ann.</i>

46
00:02:16,247 --> 00:02:18,647
- Who?
- W-Ann.

47
00:02:18,749 --> 00:02:20,478
- Yes. Yes.
- Yeah, we had-

48
00:02:20,584 --> 00:02:23,246
Of course I know Ann.
Yeah, see, I didn't mean "who."

49
00:02:23,354 --> 00:02:26,653
I meant, uh, "her."
That's a great idea.

50
00:02:26,757 --> 00:02:29,248
<i>- I love Ann.
- Great.</i>

51
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,591
Excuse me, ma'am.

52
00:02:32,696 --> 00:02:34,857
<i>George Michael, you said that
you couldn't come to church...</i>

53
00:02:34,965 --> 00:02:37,058
because you were working,
and now you're doing neither?

54
00:02:37,168 --> 00:02:40,103
That's quite a lot of sins
for a Sunday afternoon, don't you think?

55
00:02:40,204 --> 00:02:42,536
- Your virgin piña colada.
- And now you're drinking?

56
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,006
No. We're just having
a little fun, you know.

57
00:02:45,109 --> 00:02:46,940
I think the church
and studying are fun.

58
00:02:47,044 --> 00:02:49,035
- I thought you felt the same.
- Well, I do.

59
00:02:49,146 --> 00:02:51,046
L- I like not having fun.

60
00:02:51,148 --> 00:02:53,048
I like your idea
of fun, I mean.

61
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:56,017
Our idea of fun.
I like not having that.

62
00:02:57,955 --> 00:03:00,082
I'm going
back to church.

63
00:03:00,191 --> 00:03:02,853
Well, she just
killed my buzz.

64
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,690
So, you're still
enjoying this relationship?

65
00:03:05,796 --> 00:03:08,424
I mean, I guess we've lost some of the heat
since we have kissed.

66
00:03:08,532 --> 00:03:10,693
<i>I mean, how do you
relight that fire?</i>

67
00:03:10,801 --> 00:03:13,429
But I can't break up with her. I always assumed
she would break up with me.

68
00:03:13,537 --> 00:03:17,268
Well, we may have to find
a way to speed that process up.

69
00:03:17,374 --> 00:03:20,036
<i>And later that day,
Michael caught Lindsay up...</i>

70
00:03:20,144 --> 00:03:23,739
<i>on the emotional bond
he was forming with Sally.</i>

71
00:03:23,847 --> 00:03:26,975
Oh, big deal, three times.
I've had three times plenty of times.

72
00:03:27,084 --> 00:03:29,075
Yes!

73
00:03:29,186 --> 00:03:30,983
Did you call my name?

74
00:03:31,088 --> 00:03:33,113
Absolutely not.

75
00:03:33,224 --> 00:03:35,283
I just hope that George Michael
is really okay with it.

76
00:03:35,392 --> 00:03:38,589
I think you're looking
for a reason this isn't going to work...

77
00:03:38,696 --> 00:03:41,893
because you can't handle happiness,
and you like to suffer.

78
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:45,992
<i>Oh, how delicious!</i>

79
00:03:46,103 --> 00:03:48,594
Oh, hey, let's not spin
in the comfy chair.

80
00:03:48,706 --> 00:03:52,164
Look at this delicious piece of irony.
I'm being sued for divorce.

81
00:03:52,276 --> 00:03:54,403
- Me.
- Thought you were single?

82
00:03:54,511 --> 00:03:56,138
Yeah, I keep forgetting
that I got married.

83
00:03:56,247 --> 00:03:59,614
<i>Gob met a woman one night.</i>

84
00:03:59,717 --> 00:04:03,175
<i>And after a series of
escalating dares, married her.</i>

85
00:04:03,287 --> 00:04:05,084
Yes, but it's all
coming back to me now.

86
00:04:05,189 --> 00:04:06,816
<i>She was a seal dealer.</i>

87
00:04:06,924 --> 00:04:10,985
She raised and sold seals to aquariums
and marine parks, that sort of thing.

88
00:04:11,095 --> 00:04:14,656
Then she went off to fight her war
and left me to look after them.

89
00:04:14,765 --> 00:04:17,495
<i>It was while in the service
that her penchant for daring...</i>

90
00:04:17,601 --> 00:04:19,569
<i>found a natural outlet.</i>

91
00:04:20,938 --> 00:04:22,872
I've never known you
to look after a seal.

92
00:04:22,973 --> 00:04:25,669
Turns out it's a major hassle.
Tried to include one in my act once.

93
00:04:25,776 --> 00:04:28,643
There's a reason you don't typically
see live seals in a magic show.

94
00:04:28,746 --> 00:04:31,010
So with a simple wave of my-

95
00:04:32,283 --> 00:04:34,945
Oh, look-it over... there.

96
00:04:35,052 --> 00:04:37,543
Well, one of the "Desperate Housewives,"
looking so desperate.

97
00:04:39,757 --> 00:04:42,920
So I released them from whence they came,
and now she's stomping on my heart.

98
00:04:43,027 --> 00:04:44,995
- What's her first name? Quickly.
- Krindy.

99
00:04:45,095 --> 00:04:47,325
Name's not Krindy, Gob.

100
00:04:47,431 --> 00:04:51,060
Ah, Saul Zentsman.
No, that's her lawyer.

101
00:04:51,168 --> 00:04:54,035
Well, she's got a name.
And I'm gonna find out what it is...

102
00:04:54,138 --> 00:04:57,574
and then I'm gonna make a pun on it,
and that's what I'll call her.

103
00:04:57,675 --> 00:04:59,802
Bad example- if her name's Amy,
I'll call her Blamy.

104
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:01,901
That's a strong defense.
I'll tell you what.

105
00:05:02,012 --> 00:05:04,503
I'll help you look for Barry tomorrow.
I think Dad prepaid him...

106
00:05:04,615 --> 00:05:06,845
for Lindsay and Tobias's
divorce anyway.

107
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:10,317
Look at us. Three relationships,
all falling apart.

108
00:05:10,421 --> 00:05:13,618
Maybe it's time we actually
took some responsibility for that.

109
00:05:13,724 --> 00:05:16,557
- I think it's Mom's fault.
- I was gonna say the exact same thing.

110
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,220
No, that's not a spinner.

111
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:23,232
<i>So this is how my children
speak of me when I'm not here.</i>

112
00:05:23,334 --> 00:05:25,427
<i>- What are you doin' here, Mom?
- Your brother Buster...</i>

113
00:05:25,536 --> 00:05:27,504
wants to meet me
at the beach tomorrow.

114
00:05:27,604 --> 00:05:31,096
Do you know what this is about?
Because if it's about going in the ocean...

115
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:33,608
the answer is
no, he's not going in the ocean.

116
00:05:33,711 --> 00:05:35,975
Well, there are
bigger dangers, Mom.

117
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,345
Like, say, signing him up
for the army during wartime.

118
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,509
What the hell
was I supposed to do?

119
00:05:41,618 --> 00:05:44,018
Michael Moore confronted me
in front of the whole country.

120
00:05:44,121 --> 00:05:46,681
First of all, it wasn't Michael Moore.
It was a look-alike.

121
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,883
And it wasn't in front
of the whole country.

122
00:05:48,992 --> 00:05:50,926
<i>It was for a bit
on Jimmy Kimmel Live.</i>

123
00:05:51,028 --> 00:05:53,428
I don't know who that is,
and I don't care to find out.

124
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:57,091
<i>But the next day,
she did find out what Buster wanted.</i>

125
00:05:57,201 --> 00:05:59,795
Okay, I think we have enough
of you two kissing.

126
00:05:59,903 --> 00:06:02,872
Oh, I can't believe
you hired a photographer.

127
00:06:02,973 --> 00:06:06,033
<i>We haven't done this since
the Balboa Bay Window magazine.</i>

128
00:06:08,312 --> 00:06:11,372
So, I wanted you to have
a recent picture of me...

129
00:06:11,482 --> 00:06:14,417
because they want to ship me
out tomorrow with army.

130
00:06:14,518 --> 00:06:16,884
What?
To where?

131
00:06:16,987 --> 00:06:19,717
Iraq. And I just
might be out of options.

132
00:06:19,823 --> 00:06:21,723
I don't want to go,
but they keep-

133
00:06:21,825 --> 00:06:24,555
I know what this is about.
You want to go swimming in the ocean.

134
00:06:24,661 --> 00:06:26,561
Well, you can forget it.

135
00:06:26,663 --> 00:06:28,654
<i>- I don't think that's what this is about.
- Yes, it is.</i>

136
00:06:28,766 --> 00:06:30,927
He's trying to punish me
or something.

137
00:06:31,034 --> 00:06:34,526
- Whatever happened to "Keepin' It Fresh"?
- I was 30 years old then, Mother.

138
00:06:34,638 --> 00:06:38,005
I'm 32 now! And I'm not
trying to teach you a lesson.

139
00:06:38,108 --> 00:06:40,008
Well, I may not have
been a perfect mother.

140
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:41,975
But, you know,
kids don't come with a handbook.

141
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:45,515
<i>In fact, there are
thousands ofbooks written on child-rearing.</i>

142
00:06:45,616 --> 00:06:48,016
<i>But Lucille was in denial.</i>

143
00:06:48,118 --> 00:06:50,109
If he wants to
go swimming, let him.

144
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,054
<i>And Buster was far from ready
to go swimming in the ocean.</i>

145
00:06:56,527 --> 00:06:59,462
<i>And later, Michael and Gob
tracked down their attorney...</i>

146
00:06:59,563 --> 00:07:02,896
<i>- Barry Zuckerkorn.
- Thank you so much for coming down here.</i>

147
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,128
I've got a big case.
I'm representing Skip Church's restaurant.

148
00:07:06,236 --> 00:07:08,966
- I don't care.
- A waitress that works there is claiming...

149
00:07:09,072 --> 00:07:12,599
that by eating Skip's Scramble
several times a week is making her a fatty.

150
00:07:12,709 --> 00:07:15,007
<i>We need to speak to you
about getting a divorce for Gob.</i>

151
00:07:15,112 --> 00:07:18,343
- Oh, well, I got Michael
out of his marriage, didn't I?
- Actually, she died.

152
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:22,613
- You're kidding. I've been
taking credit for that for years.
- Credit?

153
00:07:22,719 --> 00:07:24,949
- Who's their lawyer?
- Saul Zentsman. Do you know him?

154
00:07:25,055 --> 00:07:28,047
I have Chinese with him every
Friday night at Miss Temple's.

155
00:07:28,158 --> 00:07:30,991
- He's tough.
- I just want my wife back.

156
00:07:31,094 --> 00:07:32,823
Save it for the stand,
okay, Tom Jane?

157
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:36,366
Fine. I'll get into this
as soon as I lose this case.

158
00:07:36,467 --> 00:07:39,231
You know who's defending
the fatty? Maggie Lizer.

159
00:07:39,336 --> 00:07:41,566
Maggie Lizer,
our old prosecutor?

160
00:07:41,672 --> 00:07:43,970
<i>Michael had an affair
with Maggie Lizer...</i>

161
00:07:44,074 --> 00:07:47,237
<i>while she was both pretending to be blind
and prosecuting the family.</i>

162
00:07:47,344 --> 00:07:50,541
<i>It was with her he'd first set
the three-time record.</i>

163
00:07:50,647 --> 00:07:52,615
Yes!

164
00:07:52,716 --> 00:07:55,310
<i>Their relationship
ended somewhat abruptly.</i>

165
00:07:57,788 --> 00:08:00,188
- Wow. How does she look?
- Well, she's get-

166
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:02,190
If you ask me, bigger.

167
00:08:02,292 --> 00:08:05,022
<i>- She was bigger-
- Are you sure you're okay to go on?</i>

168
00:08:05,128 --> 00:08:07,028
<i>Because she was pregnant.</i>

169
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:10,224
It's not my belly we have to
worry about, Your Honor.

170
00:08:10,334 --> 00:08:12,495
It's Loretta's.

171
00:08:12,603 --> 00:08:18,508
<i>Being tempted day in and day out
by those Skip's Scrambles.</i>

172
00:08:19,543 --> 00:08:21,340
Bring 'em in, boys.

173
00:08:23,413 --> 00:08:25,347
<i>Oh, I'm cooked. They love her.</i>

174
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:27,679
Tell you the truth,
I preferred it when she was blind.

175
00:08:27,784 --> 00:08:30,981
<i>And so, Michael caught up
with his onetime lover.</i>

176
00:08:31,088 --> 00:08:34,251
How you doin'?
Wow, you look... fantastic.

177
00:08:34,358 --> 00:08:37,759
Wow. Haven't seen you since we had
an affair and you ruined my career.

178
00:08:37,861 --> 00:08:40,955
Yeah, I was gonna call you
a couple of times, and then I just-

179
00:08:41,064 --> 00:08:44,056
I got to thinking, uh,
"What if she brings that up?"

180
00:08:44,167 --> 00:08:48,433
To tell you the truth, I am so relieved
not to be pretending to be blind anymore.

181
00:08:48,539 --> 00:08:53,476
It's actually taught me not to rely
on cheap tricks to get the jury's sympathy.

182
00:08:53,577 --> 00:08:55,704
<i>I'm sorry. I know I'm not
supposed to do this...</i>

183
00:08:55,812 --> 00:08:57,803
but we just spend
so much time in that box.

184
00:08:57,915 --> 00:09:01,146
- I knitted you something.
- Oh, Juror Number Four!

185
00:09:01,251 --> 00:09:05,551
Gosh, thank you. I feel so bad
I fought so hard to keep you off the jury.

186
00:09:05,656 --> 00:09:07,783
- Oh-
- Ms. Lizer, can I see you in my chambers?

187
00:09:07,891 --> 00:09:10,223
Oh. Yes, Your Honor.

188
00:09:10,327 --> 00:09:13,763
<i>In fact,
Judge Ping had a gift for Maggie too-</i>

189
00:09:13,864 --> 00:09:18,062
<i>an Ocean-Sounds Toddler Rocker
he'd asked his bailiff to assemble.</i>

190
00:09:18,168 --> 00:09:20,898
Too bad the trial's not going longer.
She could've knit you something that fit.

191
00:09:21,004 --> 00:09:23,165
I know.
I'm so big now.

192
00:09:23,273 --> 00:09:25,332
No, no, come on.
They look great.

193
00:09:25,442 --> 00:09:26,909
You look great.
You look fantastic.

194
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:29,570
Last time I saw you was in
that jury box right there, wasn't it?

195
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,773
- Wasn't it like a year ago?
- Oh, Chip, you know what?

196
00:09:31,882 --> 00:09:34,282
Can you take this
back to my house?

197
00:09:37,154 --> 00:09:39,588
Actually, it's been about
eight and a half months.

198
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,590
Eight and a half
months, huh? Wow.

199
00:09:41,692 --> 00:09:43,785
I see somebody has
been counting the, uh-

200
00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:49,329
Eight and a half months. Wow. Really?
Could've sworn it was a year.

201
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:53,581
<i>Michael had just learned...</i>

202
00:09:53,684 --> 00:09:57,415
<i>that the woman he'd been intimate
with eight and a half months earlier...</i>

203
00:09:57,521 --> 00:09:59,352
<i>was eight-and-a-half
months pregnant.</i>

204
00:09:59,457 --> 00:10:01,618
- Didn't I use something?
- No.

205
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:04,889
You thought
I was blind, remember?

206
00:10:04,995 --> 00:10:07,793
Don't worry. You're not the father, Michael.

207
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:09,058
- No problem.
- Really?

208
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:10,565
- Right.
- You sure? I mean, uh-

209
00:10:10,668 --> 00:10:13,933
<i>I could be. What if I was?
Don't you want to discuss this maybe?</i>

210
00:10:14,038 --> 00:10:16,165
Michael, I haven't
heard from you.

211
00:10:16,273 --> 00:10:18,264
L- I really don't want
to hear from you now.

212
00:10:18,376 --> 00:10:20,936
Listen, if you're interested,
come to the baptism.

213
00:10:21,045 --> 00:10:23,309
You can hurl a Bible
at the baby.

214
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:26,815
<i>And that night,
Michael met up with Sally...</i>

215
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:29,886
<i>where he felt he needed
to be honest with her.</i>

216
00:10:29,987 --> 00:10:31,887
Sally...

217
00:10:31,989 --> 00:10:33,923
you need to know
about my child.

218
00:10:34,024 --> 00:10:35,924
George Michael.
He approves.

219
00:10:36,026 --> 00:10:38,722
No, there may be
another child in the mix.

220
00:10:38,829 --> 00:10:43,266
I ran into an ex.
We had a very messed up relationship.

221
00:10:43,367 --> 00:10:46,234
It was based totally on lies.
But she's pregnant.

222
00:10:46,337 --> 00:10:49,306
She said something that led me
to believe that it might be mine.

223
00:10:49,407 --> 00:10:52,865
- But you said she was a liar.
- Sh-She is.

224
00:10:52,977 --> 00:10:55,172
She said it
wasn't mine, so-

225
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,338
- Why are you telling me this?
- Well, because obviously...

226
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,814
if it is my child, I'm gonna
have to be responsible for it...

227
00:10:59,917 --> 00:11:02,181
and that's going to make things
awfully complicated for us.

228
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:05,517
Michael, you know what? You're always
looking for things to get between us.

229
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,523
First, it was
"What's your son gonna think?"

230
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,525
And now you think
you're having a baby...

231
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,822
because a woman who lies
told you you weren't.

232
00:11:11,929 --> 00:11:15,092
That's a great way to say that. We really do
communicate well, do you know that?

233
00:11:16,367 --> 00:11:18,232
<i>Are you insane?
You broke up with her because...</i>

234
00:11:18,335 --> 00:11:21,634
somebody who doesn't want you
might be pregnant with your baby?

235
00:11:21,739 --> 00:11:24,970
No, Sally broke up with me.
And as for Maggie...

236
00:11:25,075 --> 00:11:27,441
I didn't even know that
she was pregnant when I first saw her.

237
00:11:27,545 --> 00:11:29,536
All I could see was
her giant chest- box.

238
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:32,514
She had this- Some people
call it a chest. I call it a box.

239
00:11:32,616 --> 00:11:35,517
She was holding this giant box.
Maybe I should've just stayed out of it.

240
00:11:35,619 --> 00:11:38,247
She did make it pretty clear
that she doesn't want me around.

241
00:11:38,355 --> 00:11:40,983
Come on, Michael.
She's probably not even pregnant.

242
00:11:41,091 --> 00:11:43,184
You said she was
carrying a big box?

243
00:11:43,294 --> 00:11:45,194
Pregnant women
tend not to do that.

244
00:11:45,296 --> 00:11:47,457
It did say "60 pounds" on it.

245
00:11:48,566 --> 00:11:50,659
Okay, l-I've done
this wrong.

246
00:11:50,768 --> 00:11:54,135
I should've found out whether it was a real
pregnancy before I told my dream girl about it.

247
00:11:54,238 --> 00:11:56,365
<i>You know what I do, Mike?
Check their urine.</i>

248
00:11:56,474 --> 00:11:59,841
Make 'em pee in a cup,
and pee in a cup right in front of me.

249
00:11:59,944 --> 00:12:03,141
Yeah, well, thanks, Gob. But, uh, I think
we should just keep on lookin'.

250
00:12:03,247 --> 00:12:05,238
<i>I don't know how I can
make that sound like me.</i>

251
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:08,580
So you get someone to break
into her house, rig the toilet...

252
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:11,655
collect the pee, test it,
and expose the lie.

253
00:12:11,755 --> 00:12:14,315
I mean, I'd do it, but I'm goin'
through a divorce here, guy.

254
00:12:14,425 --> 00:12:17,189
Oh, a pregnancy test.

255
00:12:17,294 --> 00:12:19,990
There's something we never had,
huh, Lindsay? Oh, no.

256
00:12:20,097 --> 00:12:22,930
We had to create our
little Frankenstein monster...

257
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:26,093
out of science and money
and just a dash of-

258
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:28,865
Maeby, what- H-How long
have you been standing there?

259
00:12:28,973 --> 00:12:31,601
- I just walked in.
- Just walked in.

260
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:35,702
Seems like only yesterday you were
bursting forth from your mother's fertile womb.

261
00:12:35,813 --> 00:12:39,613
<i>You know what? Tobias and I will
break into her house and get the specimen.</i>

262
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,345
<i>- We've been looking for a little excitement.
- Yeah!</i>

263
00:12:42,453 --> 00:12:46,048
It'll be fun. We will be like Tracy and Hepburn.

264
00:12:46,156 --> 00:12:50,422
- "What do you say, you old poop?"
- Oh, God, he's Hepburn.

265
00:12:50,528 --> 00:12:52,587
I am done with Buster.

266
00:12:52,696 --> 00:12:54,755
He pushes my buttons.
That's all he does.

267
00:12:54,865 --> 00:12:56,924
He also zips you up
and sands your elbows.

268
00:12:57,034 --> 00:13:00,470
Not anymore. No, no, no.
He's pretending he's going to war.

269
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,971
Mr. Big Shot. God knows
what he's really doing.

270
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:05,974
Wait a minute. He said he's
going to war? Aren't you worried?

271
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:07,976
Oh, you're sounding
like your uncle.

272
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:10,740
And I've had enough
of his attitude too.

273
00:13:10,848 --> 00:13:14,375
- The boy is going to war.
You're gonna have to face that.
- It's none of your business!

274
00:13:14,485 --> 00:13:16,385
He is my boy!

275
00:13:16,487 --> 00:13:18,614
- I need macaroons.
- Oh, you're high!

276
00:13:18,722 --> 00:13:22,488
Oh, well, you can win every argument like that,
but that does not make you right.

277
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:26,461
I don't want you telling him
you're his father! I need ice!

278
00:13:26,564 --> 00:13:28,589
Can't you see you're in denial?

279
00:13:28,699 --> 00:13:31,167
- You're high!
- You're drunk!

280
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:33,828
- Where did Buster say he was going?
- Iraq.

281
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:36,998
Which is a shot at your father.
Thank God he's not here to hear this.

282
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:40,304
Excuse me one second.

283
00:13:40,411 --> 00:13:42,845
<i>- It's the pipes.
- You know, Mother Lucille...</i>

284
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,745
there's a psychological
concept...

285
00:13:45,849 --> 00:13:48,317
known as denial that I
believe you're evincing.

286
00:13:48,419 --> 00:13:51,479
It's when a thought
is so hateful...

287
00:13:51,589 --> 00:13:54,319
that the mind
literally rejects it.

288
00:13:54,425 --> 00:13:58,384
You are a worse psychiatrist
than you are a son-in-law...

289
00:13:58,495 --> 00:14:00,656
and you will never
get work as an actor...

290
00:14:00,764 --> 00:14:02,994
because you have no talent.

291
00:14:04,735 --> 00:14:08,501
Well, if she's not going to say anything,
I certainly can't help her.

292
00:14:08,606 --> 00:14:11,040
<i>And Maeby
saw a way to help her cousin.</i>

293
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:13,507
I know how to get rid of Ann.
You put her in a room with Gangy.

294
00:14:13,611 --> 00:14:17,308
- She'll criticize her away.
- But what would Gangy
have to criticize about Ann?

295
00:14:17,414 --> 00:14:19,939
Oh, George Michael-

296
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,211
<i>In the attic,
Michael met with George Sr...</i>

297
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:26,119
<i>- who'd overheard about Buster.
- He can't go. You can't let him.</i>

298
00:14:26,223 --> 00:14:28,123
I command you.

299
00:14:28,225 --> 00:14:30,284
I really hate it when
you put on the God costume.

300
00:14:30,394 --> 00:14:32,521
<i>George Sr.
Had always worn the God costume...</i>

301
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:35,190
<i>at the annual
Living Classics Pageant...</i>

302
00:14:35,299 --> 00:14:39,963
<i>where he and Buster re-created
Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam.</i>

303
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:44,530
What if I never get a chance to reach out
and touch that hand of his again?

304
00:14:44,642 --> 00:14:46,906
- I gotta go to him.
- Pop, you're a wanted man.

305
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,343
You cannot risk leaving
the attic all the time.

306
00:14:49,446 --> 00:14:51,676
Oh, when? When have I
ever left the attic?

307
00:14:51,782 --> 00:14:54,979
Two days ago. Right? Saw you
floating around the Ford dealership.

308
00:14:55,085 --> 00:14:57,553
Yeah, well, have you seen
the new Ford Mustang?

309
00:14:57,655 --> 00:14:59,555
You could hump that hood.

310
00:14:59,657 --> 00:15:02,353
<i>And Michael
set the plan in motion to get...</i>

311
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:04,859
<i>- Maggie out ofher house.
- Hi, Maggie.</i>

312
00:15:04,962 --> 00:15:07,328
- Are you blind again?
- For the pizza guy.

313
00:15:07,431 --> 00:15:09,899
I give him a five.
I tell him to keep the change.

314
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,264
What are you doin' here,
Michael? I'm with a client.

315
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:14,132
- Is that the pizza?
- No!

316
00:15:14,238 --> 00:15:16,001
You'll get your pizza.

317
00:15:16,106 --> 00:15:19,234
She's taking the stand tomorrow.
I want to make sure it creaks.

318
00:15:19,343 --> 00:15:21,402
There's so much I don't
understand about the law.

319
00:15:21,512 --> 00:15:25,949
Look, Maggie, if this child is mine,
I really need to know.

320
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:29,611
So can you spare a few minutes for someone
who might be the father of your baby?

321
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,950
Of course I can.

322
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:35,048
- Okay.
- But it's not you.

323
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,530
Oh, for God's sakes.

324
00:15:41,632 --> 00:15:44,226
Oh, come on!

325
00:15:44,334 --> 00:15:46,564
Fine.
Let me get Miss Fat Ass outta here...

326
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,729
- and I'll meet you in the car.
- Okay.

327
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:51,865
<i>Meanwhile,
on the other side of Maggie's house...</i>

328
00:15:51,975 --> 00:15:55,342
<i>Lindsay and Tobias were putting
their plan into action.</i>

329
00:15:55,446 --> 00:15:57,937
- I'm cloaking myself in her scent.
- Oh! She's not blind.

330
00:15:58,048 --> 00:15:59,948
Well, she was
when she bought this.

331
00:16:02,052 --> 00:16:04,418
- Oh, my God! That's her!
- Get in the tub!

332
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:09,487
<i>Buster, meanwhile,
received an unexpected visitor.</i>

333
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:12,721
I want you to know that
it's okay for you to hide.

334
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:16,732
A man can hide.
There's a quiet courage in that.

335
00:16:16,834 --> 00:16:18,734
You're a good uncle.

336
00:16:18,836 --> 00:16:21,805
I'm not your uncle.
I'm your father.

337
00:16:21,905 --> 00:16:24,135
- What?
- Shh. Shh. Quiet courage.

338
00:16:24,241 --> 00:16:26,675
Quiet courage.
Hide.

339
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:29,177
<i>But Buster was confused.</i>

340
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,839
You lied to me.
Uncle Oscar's my father.

341
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,611
He just told me so. And maybe
you're not even my real mother.

342
00:16:34,718 --> 00:16:37,949
For all I know, Lucille 2
is my real mother. Oh!

343
00:16:38,055 --> 00:16:39,989
Buster, you were
never supposed to know.

344
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:43,184
Oh, yeah? Well, here's something
you should know. I'm going to war!

345
00:16:48,084 --> 00:16:51,349
<i>Buster had just discovered
he'd been lied to by his parents.</i>

346
00:16:51,454 --> 00:16:53,718
I'm going to war!

347
00:16:53,823 --> 00:16:55,950
- You told him you were his father!
- I did no such thing!

348
00:16:56,058 --> 00:16:58,219
- You're high!
- You're drunk!

349
00:16:59,695 --> 00:17:01,595
George.

350
00:17:01,697 --> 00:17:04,131
He must've come here
to say good-bye to Buster.

351
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:07,725
<i>And that's when
Lucille snapped out ofher denial.</i>

352
00:17:07,837 --> 00:17:09,964
My baby's going to war.

353
00:17:10,072 --> 00:17:12,370
<i>Lindsay and Tobias
were gathering evidence...</i>

354
00:17:12,475 --> 00:17:14,636
<i>that Maggie
was truly pregnant.</i>

355
00:17:14,744 --> 00:17:16,644
<i>And they were
having fun doing it.</i>

356
00:17:16,746 --> 00:17:19,544
That's the first time we were
in the shower since our honeymoon.

357
00:17:19,649 --> 00:17:21,549
And this time, no tears.

358
00:17:21,651 --> 00:17:24,381
Tobias, this is the box that
Michael was talking about. "60 pounds."

359
00:17:24,487 --> 00:17:28,480
<i>But it didn't weigh 60 pounds.</i>

360
00:17:28,591 --> 00:17:32,254
<i>Michael was stalling Maggie,
and they were also having fun.</i>

361
00:17:32,361 --> 00:17:35,660
Sally Sitwell? You know,
I think I had her little play oven.

362
00:17:35,765 --> 00:17:38,233
Yeah, I know. It's a funny name.
But she's a doll.

363
00:17:38,334 --> 00:17:40,461
Yeah, I had one.

364
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:42,902
If you pull her hair,
she'd cry or something.

365
00:17:43,005 --> 00:17:44,802
This one kinda
does that too.

366
00:17:44,907 --> 00:17:47,171
- Hello.
- We got the pee, and we're gonna get it checked.

367
00:17:47,276 --> 00:17:51,007
But, listen, you should know that
that box that says "60 pounds"-

368
00:17:51,113 --> 00:17:53,308
it's actually
like two pounds.

369
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:56,385
I think she's pregnant, Michael.
I mean, there's baby stuff here and-

370
00:17:56,485 --> 00:17:59,386
Tobias, stop it.
That's for the baby. It's not-

371
00:17:59,488 --> 00:18:01,615
<i>- We're having a really good time.
- Yeah?</i>

372
00:18:01,724 --> 00:18:04,921
- Well, I kind of am too.
- Bye.

373
00:18:05,027 --> 00:18:07,518
So, no more lies.
Tell me the truth.

374
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:11,259
If-lf that baby is mine,
maybe we're meant to be together.

375
00:18:13,336 --> 00:18:15,770
Of course it is, Michael.

376
00:18:17,807 --> 00:18:20,742
<i>But that's when the Fünkes
discovered what was in the box...</i>

377
00:18:20,843 --> 00:18:22,834
<i>that was so easy to lift.</i>

378
00:18:25,781 --> 00:18:28,773
- That's what it is.
- Okay, the box was light 'cause
it had a fake stomach in it.

379
00:18:28,884 --> 00:18:31,512
It looks like she's faking it.
Oh, God. I hope you get this.

380
00:18:31,621 --> 00:18:33,486
Wait up, please.

381
00:18:33,589 --> 00:18:36,387
<i>And George Michael and Maeby
brought Ann to the penthouse...</i>

382
00:18:36,492 --> 00:18:39,222
<i>in hopes that Lucille
would drive her away.</i>

383
00:18:39,328 --> 00:18:41,057
Isn't Ann great?

384
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:42,960
<i>- Oh, she's lovely.
- Unfortunately...</i>

385
00:18:43,065 --> 00:18:45,829
<i>she was distracted by
the thought oflosing Buster.</i>

386
00:18:45,935 --> 00:18:47,664
Hey, do you have
any bread pudding?

387
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:50,830
<i>'Cause you'd be surprised
how much this one can put away.</i>

388
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,137
- Ha!
- Now that Buster's not here,
there's no one to finish it.

389
00:18:54,243 --> 00:18:57,576
<i>I don't care
if I ever eat again.</i>

390
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,550
You know,
when times are tough...

391
00:19:06,656 --> 00:19:09,921
you can always turn to
the power of prayer.

392
00:19:10,026 --> 00:19:12,358
Here we go.

393
00:19:12,461 --> 00:19:15,055
Show me.

394
00:19:15,164 --> 00:19:18,065
<i>This was a big get for God...</i>

395
00:19:18,167 --> 00:19:20,499
<i>and Michael brought
Maggie home to meet his son.</i>

396
00:19:20,603 --> 00:19:23,538
This is gonna be easy. He's been signing off
on everyone lately. Maybe he called.

397
00:19:23,639 --> 00:19:26,107
Hey, so what's the deal on Zuckerkorn?

398
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,972
'Cause you know my fat case-
it's really pretty thin.

399
00:19:29,078 --> 00:19:32,241
- Lying, untrustworthy-
- Yeah.

400
00:19:32,348 --> 00:19:34,714
Plus, I heard he
hangs out at rest stops.

401
00:19:34,817 --> 00:19:36,717
No, no. I'm talkin'
about you, Maggie.

402
00:19:36,819 --> 00:19:38,719
I don't know why I'm surprised.
I shouldn't be.

403
00:19:38,821 --> 00:19:40,686
You're a liar.
You lie.

404
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:43,782
<i>Well, I mean, I heard
he hangs out at rest stops. Okay-</i>

405
00:19:43,893 --> 00:19:47,454
And I keep buying it too. And so maybe
there is something wrong with me.

406
00:19:47,563 --> 00:19:49,428
I thought we were startin'
to trust each other.

407
00:19:49,532 --> 00:19:53,525
I got a message from my sister saying
there's a box at your house with a fat suit in it.

408
00:19:53,636 --> 00:19:56,628
- What've you got?
A different one for each trimester?
- You had your sister...

409
00:19:56,739 --> 00:19:59,435
- break into my house?
- Which one are you wearin' right now?

410
00:19:59,542 --> 00:20:01,442
Is this
the ready-to-burst model?

411
00:20:01,544 --> 00:20:04,638
Now, there's
zero trust here. Good-bye.

412
00:20:04,747 --> 00:20:07,773
It's been fun-

413
00:20:07,883 --> 00:20:10,443
<i>not.
- Michael had hoped
something more dramatic...</i>

414
00:20:10,553 --> 00:20:12,384
<i>would have
come out ofhis mouth.</i>

415
00:20:12,488 --> 00:20:14,115
<i>Or at least more current.</i>

416
00:20:14,223 --> 00:20:17,249
Oh, you're so right, Michael.
I really can't be trusted.

417
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:19,953
'Cause I'm fakin' it-

418
00:20:21,597 --> 00:20:23,497
not.

419
00:20:26,102 --> 00:20:28,662
Hello, Michael.
Well, my wife and I...

420
00:20:28,771 --> 00:20:33,037
finally had the thrill of seeing
a plus sign on a pregnancy test.

421
00:20:33,142 --> 00:20:35,235
You're gonna be a daddy!

422
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,605
<i>On the next
Arrested Development.</i>

423
00:20:39,715 --> 00:20:42,081
<i>Barry gets a big break on his case.</i>

424
00:20:42,184 --> 00:20:44,744
The fat girl in my
Skip Church's case? Not fat.

425
00:20:44,854 --> 00:20:47,823
The attorney bought her a fat suit.
Oh! I've got another case.

426
00:20:47,923 --> 00:20:49,584
Maggie is suing you
for paternity.

427
00:20:49,692 --> 00:20:52,354
<i>And for the first time, Lucille prays.</i>

428
00:20:52,461 --> 00:20:55,021
Take something else from us.
Do whatever you have to...

429
00:20:55,131 --> 00:20:57,031
to keep my boy
from going to war.

430
00:20:57,133 --> 00:20:59,033
<i>And Buster is on his way...</i>

431
00:20:59,135 --> 00:21:02,832
<i>when he decides to pursue
a long-delayed rite of passage.</i>

432
00:21:04,406 --> 00:21:07,204
<i>Loose seal!
Watch out for loose seal!</i>

433
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:09,368
I don't care about Lucille!

434
00:21:09,478 --> 00:21:11,378
She lies!

435
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,505
<i>And then a seal bites offhis hand.</i>

436
00:21:13,616 --> 00:21:14,674
Aaa-

437
00:21:14,784 --> 00:21:16,012
...men.
