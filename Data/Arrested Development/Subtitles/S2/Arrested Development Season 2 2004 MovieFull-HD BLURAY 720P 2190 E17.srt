1
00:00:01,344 --> 00:00:04,404
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:04,514 --> 00:00:06,505
<i>and the one son who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:06,616 --> 00:00:08,607
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:14,157 --> 00:00:15,852
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

5
00:00:18,895 --> 00:00:22,353
<i>Michael Bluth had set up
a meeting with Cal Cullen...</i>

6
00:00:22,465 --> 00:00:25,263
<i>owner of one of the largest
parcels ofland in Orange County.</i>

7
00:00:25,368 --> 00:00:28,599
I hope that I can prove to you
that we have a very impressive company.

8
00:00:28,705 --> 00:00:32,539
<i>Well, your family did not come off well
on last night's Scandalmakers.</i>

9
00:00:32,642 --> 00:00:34,542
<i>Scandalmakers was a show...</i>

10
00:00:34,644 --> 00:00:37,112
<i>that reenacted
headline-grabbing stories.</i>

11
00:00:37,213 --> 00:00:39,113
<i>The latest was
about the Bluth family...</i>

12
00:00:39,215 --> 00:00:41,479
<i>the rights of which had been
signed away by Tobias...</i>

13
00:00:41,584 --> 00:00:44,451
<i>in exchange for the part of George Sr.</i>

14
00:00:44,554 --> 00:00:48,217
<i>When allegations
surfaced he'd illegally built homes in Iraq...</i>

15
00:00:48,324 --> 00:00:51,122
<i>George Bluth Sr.,
assisted by his secretary, Kitty...</i>

16
00:00:51,227 --> 00:00:53,127
<i>escaped the country.</i>

17
00:00:53,229 --> 00:00:57,290
<i>Due to poor acting, the burden
of the story was placed on the narrator.</i>

18
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,029
<i>Only to be found hiding
under one of the homes that he built.</i>

19
00:01:01,137 --> 00:01:03,901
<i>He was actually found
in a hole near the house...</i>

20
00:01:04,007 --> 00:01:06,601
<i>but this inattention
to detail was typical...</i>

21
00:01:06,709 --> 00:01:09,974
<i>- of the laziness the show's
narrator was known for.
- I can't survive under the house.</i>

22
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,140
Perhaps an attic shall I seek.

23
00:01:13,249 --> 00:01:15,649
<i>Real shoddy narrating.
Just pure crap.</i>

24
00:01:15,752 --> 00:01:18,653
But we're back on track,
and we are scandal-free.

25
00:01:18,755 --> 00:01:22,452
<i>Hey! You start
the meeting without me?</i>

26
00:01:22,559 --> 00:01:26,689
Mother, uh, this is Cal Cullen.
You remember my mother, Lucille.

27
00:01:26,796 --> 00:01:29,264
We're right in the middle of talking...

28
00:01:29,365 --> 00:01:31,629
about this exciting giveaway
spa package to entice buyers.

29
00:01:31,734 --> 00:01:33,929
You know, he's never taken me anywhere.

30
00:01:34,037 --> 00:01:37,006
Oh, no. We have to live high and dry.

31
00:01:37,107 --> 00:01:39,132
Well, you're certainly not dry.

32
00:01:39,242 --> 00:01:43,838
<i>Michael, I'm not a prude, but it's 1:00
in the afternoon. Is your mother drunk?</i>

33
00:01:43,947 --> 00:01:47,041
<i>I'd have to get up pretty early
to get drunk by 1:00.</i>

34
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,641
<i>As it turns out,
she had gotten up early...</i>

35
00:01:49,752 --> 00:01:53,188
<i>and had taken pain medication
because of a hangover-related headache.</i>

36
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:57,157
<i>However, she mistook
the "drowsy eye"alcohol warning...</i>

37
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:00,752
<i>for a "winking eye"alcohol suggestion.</i>

38
00:02:00,864 --> 00:02:04,891
<i>Fortunately, she had the good sense
not to drive herself to the meeting.</i>

39
00:02:05,001 --> 00:02:07,265
No. I'll call for a car.

40
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:12,034
<i>Unfortunately, this was
after a failed attempt to do so.</i>

41
00:02:12,142 --> 00:02:14,542
Who the hell put-

42
00:02:14,644 --> 00:02:17,738
<i>Michael, I'm sorry.
I cannot do business with you.</i>

43
00:02:17,847 --> 00:02:20,577
<i>I mean, I couldn't afford
to end up on Scandalmakers.</i>

44
00:02:20,683 --> 00:02:23,652
Oh, you could afford to do anything
you want. You're just a big chicken.

45
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,660
<i>Michael realized it might be time...</i>

46
00:02:32,762 --> 00:02:34,821
<i>to deal with his mother's
apparent problem.</i>

47
00:02:34,931 --> 00:02:37,991
Okay, that seems as good a place
as any to end the meeting.

48
00:02:41,471 --> 00:02:43,769
No, I'm not doing another
intervention with her.

49
00:02:43,873 --> 00:02:45,932
Last time, I felt terrible for a week.

50
00:02:46,042 --> 00:02:49,239
<i>One year earlier,
the family had tried an intervention.</i>

51
00:02:49,345 --> 00:02:52,246
- You're pouring a drink? What are you doing?
- What if she's mad?

52
00:02:52,348 --> 00:02:55,249
- Good point.
- Perhaps I'll have a little sip of something.

53
00:02:55,351 --> 00:02:57,581
Guys, what could she do to us?

54
00:02:58,888 --> 00:03:01,049
Do we have anything single malt?

55
00:03:01,157 --> 00:03:04,058
<i>And although
the intervention didn't work-</i>

56
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,357
- We think you have a "prollen."
- You're a mesh.

57
00:03:07,463 --> 00:03:10,432
<i>It turned into one
of the Bluth family's better parties.</i>

58
00:03:18,675 --> 00:03:21,075
<i>Well, maybe an intervention
is the wrong approach.</i>

59
00:03:21,177 --> 00:03:23,577
What about rehab?
She was just a mess at the meeting.

60
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,444
Where were you, by the way?
I could've used your help with Mom.

61
00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:30,280
I believe I told you I was gonna be out
for the holidays. It's spring break.

62
00:03:30,386 --> 00:03:33,082
Not that I can enjoy it.
My reputation's been ruined...

63
00:03:33,189 --> 00:03:37,216
by that jerk Phillip Litt, who put
my one magic show flub on his DVD.

64
00:03:37,327 --> 00:03:40,091
<i>Gob had performed a magic act
at an earlier spring break...</i>

65
00:03:40,196 --> 00:03:43,563
<i>to get exposure on the
best-selling video series...</i>

66
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:45,634
<i>Girls with Low Self-Esteem.</i>

67
00:03:48,338 --> 00:03:49,999
Or two flubs or whatever.

68
00:03:50,106 --> 00:03:52,006
<i>There were seven flubs...</i>

69
00:03:52,108 --> 00:03:54,303
<i>and after the show,
he signed a release.</i>

70
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:58,244
- You're not gonna use the time
that I screwed up, right?
- That wasn't part of the act?

71
00:03:58,348 --> 00:04:01,044
Come on, man.
I'd never do anything to embarrass you.

72
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,050
Please.

73
00:04:04,387 --> 00:04:08,187
Oh. Uh, you don't know
a good bird hospital, do you?

74
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,191
You're getting all this, right?

75
00:04:10,293 --> 00:04:14,024
<i>Well, at least the Orange County Register
didn't say of your performance...</i>

76
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:18,032
"If this is who George Sr. Is,
let's hope he remains missing."

77
00:04:18,134 --> 00:04:21,069
Meanwhile, they loved
Dave Attell's risky choice...

78
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,730
of wearing cutoffs
while portraying me.

79
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,001
<i>In fact, Mr. Attell was portraying...</i>

80
00:04:26,109 --> 00:04:28,669
<i>Tobias's actual never-nude affliction...</i>

81
00:04:28,778 --> 00:04:31,246
<i>but this perplexed
the Scandalmakers audience...</i>

82
00:04:31,347 --> 00:04:35,249
<i>due to the unfocused nature
of the narrator's explanation.</i>

83
00:04:35,351 --> 00:04:38,912
No, I think mine's worse. You should've seen
what happened to me on the boardwalk today.

84
00:04:39,022 --> 00:04:41,547
They were laughing at me. Me!

85
00:04:44,027 --> 00:04:47,224
Those tapes are awful.
Women tricked into taking their tops off.

86
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:50,026
I have a daughter I don't want
corrupted by the media.

87
00:04:50,133 --> 00:04:51,794
<i>Unbeknownst to Lindsay...</i>

88
00:04:51,901 --> 00:04:53,994
<i>Maeby was a fairly prominent
member of the media...</i>

89
00:04:54,103 --> 00:04:58,870
<i>as she had secretly conned her way
into a job as a film executive.</i>

90
00:04:58,975 --> 00:05:00,875
<i>This Young Man on the Beach
script sucks.</i>

91
00:05:00,977 --> 00:05:02,911
She'd go to the guy just
'cause he said she's awesome?

92
00:05:03,012 --> 00:05:05,708
- You call that dialogue?
- Hey, I didn't write it.

93
00:05:05,815 --> 00:05:09,342
No, but you're gonna fix it. It's a spring break
movie. Find out what they sound like.

94
00:05:09,452 --> 00:05:12,387
Oh, yeah, right. Do you really
think I look college-aged?

95
00:05:12,488 --> 00:05:15,719
I'm not drunk.
But I'm willing to be. Hint.

96
00:05:15,825 --> 00:05:19,158
Oh, Mort, you're gonna be
so easy to blackmail. Hint.

97
00:05:23,266 --> 00:05:26,997
This pig Phillip Litt is out there
asking girls to take their tops off.

98
00:05:27,103 --> 00:05:31,130
- It's an outrage.
- Well, of course you feel that way. You're jealous.

99
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,505
You're a surfboard.
But I do agree he is a pig.

100
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,510
Hey! What the hell was that for?

101
00:05:36,612 --> 00:05:38,876
Can we stop worrying about girls
with low self-esteem...

102
00:05:38,981 --> 00:05:42,075
and start focusing on sobering up
the woman who gave us ours?

103
00:05:42,185 --> 00:05:46,519
- What do you think about rehab?
- She won't go willingly. I can tell you that.

104
00:05:46,622 --> 00:05:50,251
May I make a suggestion?
Get implants. Really.

105
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,521
Wha- Come on!
This stuff is expensive!

106
00:05:52,628 --> 00:05:55,927
<i>So Michael set out to convince
his mother that she needed help.</i>

107
00:05:56,032 --> 00:05:58,933
Hello? Hello?
I have a surprise for you.

108
00:05:59,035 --> 00:06:01,196
- Did I win the prize?
- You won the prize.

109
00:06:01,304 --> 00:06:05,104
I won the prize!
I won the prize! For what?

110
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:07,699
We were gonna give
one employee a week at the spa.

111
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,370
We were even gonna put them
in the ad, but then I thought...

112
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,880
"What about Mom?
She's elegant. She deserves it."

113
00:06:12,982 --> 00:06:15,212
I was gonna tell you at the office,
but then I thought...

114
00:06:15,318 --> 00:06:19,755
"No. If I bring her around now,
she might vomit on the overhead projector."

115
00:06:19,856 --> 00:06:23,883
I'm so embarrassed about that. I don't think
I was supposed to drink with my medication.

116
00:06:23,993 --> 00:06:26,928
<i>Actually, it wasn't even her medication.</i>

117
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:29,463
Of course, I can't take Oscar
to an elegant place.

118
00:06:29,565 --> 00:06:32,830
His only remaining pair of pants
blew apart the other day.

119
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:35,768
I was thinking that I would
go with you for the week.

120
00:06:35,872 --> 00:06:39,968
So what? I just stay here alone? I'm not
exactly equipped to run this place by myself!

121
00:06:40,076 --> 00:06:42,135
You can't just
leave me here alone!

122
00:06:43,179 --> 00:06:45,579
Have a great trip.

123
00:06:45,681 --> 00:06:49,082
<i>But it wouldn't turn out
to be a great trip at all.</i>

124
00:06:49,185 --> 00:06:51,847
Hello. Welcome to Shady Pines Rehab.
Just sign right here.

125
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:54,718
Rehab? This isn't a spa.
This isn't a spa!

126
00:06:54,824 --> 00:06:57,418
- Come here. Wait. Get her. Come here, Mom!
- We got a runner!

127
00:06:57,527 --> 00:07:00,462
<i>As Michael's mother
was being held against her will...</i>

128
00:07:00,563 --> 00:07:04,090
<i>George Sr. Was about to be confronted
with a similar problem.</i>

129
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,100
Kitty. How'd you find me?

130
00:07:06,202 --> 00:07:09,763
<i>I thought you were dead
until I saw Scandalmakers!</i>

131
00:07:09,872 --> 00:07:13,638
They got so much wrong. But something
about your son-in-law's comment...

132
00:07:13,743 --> 00:07:18,339
<i>"Perhaps an attic shall I seek,"
had the ring of truth to it.</i>

133
00:07:18,448 --> 00:07:20,507
<i>Notice it wasn't
something the narrator said.</i>

134
00:07:20,616 --> 00:07:25,610
- You abandoned me in Mexico!
- Kitty, honey, l-I know you're mad.

135
00:07:25,721 --> 00:07:28,451
Stop talking, George.
You stop talking!

136
00:07:28,558 --> 00:07:31,789
I am in charge now.
You're coming with me.

137
00:07:31,894 --> 00:07:34,385
No, I can't. I ca-
I have a life here.

138
00:07:34,497 --> 00:07:37,796
There are people who-
who depend on me.

139
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,334
Fine. But I can't make
any promises...

140
00:07:40,436 --> 00:07:43,371
about what happens to that
cooler of evidence I have.

141
00:07:43,473 --> 00:07:47,375
If I could just have
a moment to say good-bye.

142
00:07:49,412 --> 00:07:51,312
<i>Meanwhile, at the banana stand...</i>

143
00:07:51,414 --> 00:07:53,644
<i>Maeby was hoping to find
some witty banter...</i>

144
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:56,149
<i>with which to authenticate
her feature film.</i>

145
00:07:56,252 --> 00:07:58,777
I want the hot chick to serve me.

146
00:07:58,888 --> 00:08:01,186
What other words would you
use to describe me?

147
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:03,258
- Um, she's 15, and she's my cousin.
- So?

148
00:08:03,359 --> 00:08:06,988
So you can't touch
your cousin- my cousin.

149
00:08:07,096 --> 00:08:09,189
You know, you don't
have to stick around.

150
00:08:09,298 --> 00:08:12,995
I could just work late tonight. It doesn't
matter, 'cause my girlfriend, she's out of town.

151
00:08:13,102 --> 00:08:15,002
She's actually kind of lucky in the end...

152
00:08:15,104 --> 00:08:17,595
'cause all these guys
would be coming on to her.

153
00:08:17,707 --> 00:08:20,369
Yeah, you really
dodged a bullet there.

154
00:08:20,476 --> 00:08:24,344
<i>Nearby, Phillip Litt
was making his latest video.</i>

155
00:08:24,447 --> 00:08:27,678
Everybody gather around!
Gather around! Ladies, here's the deal.

156
00:08:27,783 --> 00:08:30,115
We have hats. You have breasts.

157
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:32,585
You show your breasts,
you get a hat, okay?

158
00:08:32,688 --> 00:08:36,249
So if anyone wants to get back
at Daddy, now's the time.

159
00:08:36,359 --> 00:08:40,853
<i>- Whoo! Wait. Cut, cut.
We got a surfboard in the shot.
- Surfboard. Stop tape.</i>

160
00:08:40,963 --> 00:08:43,557
We're here to stop you from
taking advantage of these girls.

161
00:08:45,668 --> 00:08:48,865
You know what? You're sassy. You're sexy.
You speak your mind. There's nothin' hotter.

162
00:08:48,971 --> 00:08:52,805
- Give her a hat, Barry.
- I don't want a hat.
I want you to leave these women alone.

163
00:08:52,909 --> 00:08:54,877
I'm giving them a chance
to be idolized...

164
00:08:54,977 --> 00:08:57,207
which is an opportunity these women
are never gonna have again.

165
00:08:57,313 --> 00:08:59,440
<i>- I want to be ideolized.
- Yeah, you do!</i>

166
00:08:59,549 --> 00:09:03,212
Eileen, stop it.
You've got nothing to gain from that.

167
00:09:03,319 --> 00:09:05,913
That's easy for you to say.
You already have a hat.

168
00:09:06,022 --> 00:09:08,388
<i>Come on, girls!</i>

169
00:09:08,491 --> 00:09:11,790
This is no way to get
your daddies to notice you!

170
00:09:11,894 --> 00:09:14,863
<i>Nearby, Lindsay's
own daddy failed to notice her...</i>

171
00:09:14,964 --> 00:09:17,728
<i>as he was being taken
to a local motel...</i>

172
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:21,166
<i>where he refused
Kitty's sexual advances.</i>

173
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:25,229
You promised me power
and a child, and I have neither.

174
00:09:25,341 --> 00:09:30,176
I'm gonna take care
of this problem... on my own.

175
00:09:33,516 --> 00:09:36,349
You never promise crazy a baby.

176
00:09:36,452 --> 00:09:40,081
<i>George Sr. Was abandoned
and longed for Lucille...</i>

177
00:09:40,189 --> 00:09:43,522
<i>and Buster felt the same way.</i>

178
00:09:44,694 --> 00:09:49,688
<i>Upon her knee</i>

179
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:55,101
<i>- So fine to be
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!</i>

180
00:09:55,204 --> 00:09:58,765
<i>Mother and boy</i>

181
00:09:58,874 --> 00:10:00,774
<i>Restless, Buster went to the kitchen...</i>

182
00:10:00,876 --> 00:10:02,810
<i>to find something to help him sleep...</i>

183
00:10:02,912 --> 00:10:06,211
<i>- when he came across Lucille's
emergency stash of wine-
- Motherboy</i>

184
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:09,307
<i>which he mistook
for a giantjuice box.</i>

185
00:10:12,555 --> 00:10:17,618
<i>It was the first taste of alcohol
Buster had since he was nursing.</i>

186
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,661
- Mama!

187
00:10:19,762 --> 00:10:21,662
<i>And Michael, his mother
no longer a threat...</i>

188
00:10:21,764 --> 00:10:24,699
<i>- Thank you so much for your understanding, sir.
- met again with Cal Cullen.</i>

189
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,634
As I mentioned on the phone,
she did seek help.

190
00:10:30,673 --> 00:10:34,666
And it was extremely moving when she
finally admitted that she has a problem.

191
00:10:34,777 --> 00:10:36,904
We'll take good care of you
here at Shady Pines.

192
00:10:37,013 --> 00:10:38,913
I'll take care of you,
you son of a-

193
00:10:39,015 --> 00:10:42,382
Shady Pines is a wonderful
facility up there on the hill.

194
00:10:42,485 --> 00:10:46,319
<i>- You know, they used to film Sugarfoot up there.
- No?</i>

195
00:10:46,422 --> 00:10:49,482
<i>- Were you a fan of Sugarfoot?
- I loved it.</i>

196
00:10:49,592 --> 00:10:51,457
<i>Sugarfoot had been off the air...</i>

197
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,721
<i>12 years before Michael was born.</i>

198
00:10:53,829 --> 00:10:56,992
<i>Sing the theme song
of Sugarfoot along with me.</i>

199
00:10:59,568 --> 00:11:01,399
- Yes

200
00:11:06,842 --> 00:11:09,242
Oh, what the hell.
You're a good kid.

201
00:11:09,345 --> 00:11:11,245
Let's make the deal.

202
00:11:11,347 --> 00:11:13,247
<i>- Oh, great. I've got papers-
- Michael!</i>

203
00:11:13,349 --> 00:11:16,477
Remember me? Perhaps
this'll jog your memory.

204
00:11:16,585 --> 00:11:19,713
- Oh! They're crooked.
- I've kidnapped your father, Michael...

205
00:11:19,822 --> 00:11:22,017
and I have a cooler full of evidence...

206
00:11:22,124 --> 00:11:24,422
that will bring down
this corrupt company.

207
00:11:24,527 --> 00:11:29,226
Unless your mother meets me
today at 4:00 at Señor Tadpole's.

208
00:11:29,331 --> 00:11:32,562
Spring break. Whoo!

209
00:11:36,584 --> 00:11:40,645
<i>Dad?
- Michael's father
had just been kidnapped.</i>

210
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44,821
Hello?

211
00:11:44,926 --> 00:11:48,157
<i>And then he received a call that
his brother had been found drunk.</i>

212
00:11:48,262 --> 00:11:50,059
No, I'm fine. I'm telling you.

213
00:11:50,164 --> 00:11:53,395
For the first time, I realize that
maybe I am better off without her!

214
00:11:53,501 --> 00:11:56,732
- Yeah, well, we've gotta bring her back.
- Oh, thank God!

215
00:11:56,838 --> 00:11:59,102
So if we want to get
that evidence back, and Dad...

216
00:11:59,207 --> 00:12:01,232
Kitty is insisting
on a meeting with Mom.

217
00:12:01,342 --> 00:12:04,743
- What can Mom do for her?
- I don't know. I've gotta get
my hands on that evidence.

218
00:12:04,846 --> 00:12:06,746
Problem is I just
checked her into rehab.

219
00:12:06,848 --> 00:12:09,009
They're not exactly gonna
let me take her to a bar.

220
00:12:09,117 --> 00:12:11,585
<i>So, Gob, I need you to help me
sneak her past the guards.</i>

221
00:12:11,686 --> 00:12:15,452
Well, gee, I didn't think the woman I'd be
checking out at spring break would be Mom.

222
00:12:15,556 --> 00:12:18,286
- She's better looking
than the whores you date.
- Don't call my escorts whores.

223
00:12:18,392 --> 00:12:20,917
- Mom's still got it!
- I don't date whores!

224
00:12:21,028 --> 00:12:24,486
Stop it! Stop it! This objectification
of women has to stop!

225
00:12:24,599 --> 00:12:27,261
- It's just Mom and whores.
- No, how would you like it?

226
00:12:27,368 --> 00:12:29,268
Actually, that's not a bad idea.

227
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:32,430
I should turn the tables on men
and see how they like being objectified.

228
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:36,442
- Men with low self-esteem. Get their clothes off.
- That is a great-

229
00:12:36,544 --> 00:12:39,809
That is a great social statement.

230
00:12:39,914 --> 00:12:43,975
<i>I shall get the video camera.
This is ripe for parody.</i>

231
00:12:44,085 --> 00:12:46,349
This is ripe!

232
00:12:46,454 --> 00:12:50,356
<i>Hejust wants to see
boys'Linuses. Oh, God.</i>

233
00:12:53,127 --> 00:12:55,027
Here we go.

234
00:12:55,129 --> 00:12:59,327
<i>And so Michael went back to see his mom.</i>

235
00:12:59,433 --> 00:13:01,264
<i>L- I know that you're upset with me...</i>

236
00:13:01,369 --> 00:13:03,963
<i>because I brought you here
under false pretenses...</i>

237
00:13:04,071 --> 00:13:06,198
<i>- but I really was worried about you.
- Oh, please.</i>

238
00:13:06,307 --> 00:13:08,298
I've been drinking
since before you were born.

239
00:13:08,409 --> 00:13:11,378
So if alcohol is the reason I'm here,
I've got news for you, bub.

240
00:13:11,479 --> 00:13:13,379
It's the only reason you're here too.

241
00:13:13,481 --> 00:13:15,676
Hey, you're mean sober too.

242
00:13:15,783 --> 00:13:18,081
<i>Uh, listen. I need your help.</i>

243
00:13:18,186 --> 00:13:21,349
Kitty has shown up,
and she got ahold of Dad.

244
00:13:21,455 --> 00:13:23,923
She found him in the attic?

245
00:13:24,025 --> 00:13:27,984
<i>They had a rerun of Scandalmakers
last night. Everybody figured it out.</i>

246
00:13:28,095 --> 00:13:30,086
She would like to meet you at a bar.

247
00:13:30,198 --> 00:13:34,157
She says she's got some evidence that could
bring the business down if you don't go.

248
00:13:34,268 --> 00:13:36,168
You're sending me into a bar?

249
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:39,398
Are you sure you can trust me
to make decisions for myself?

250
00:13:39,507 --> 00:13:41,600
I just need you to find
out what she wants...

251
00:13:41,709 --> 00:13:43,700
while I check all the local
motels for Dad.

252
00:13:43,811 --> 00:13:45,870
<i>All right.
But here's what I want.</i>

253
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,948
A spa weekend with you.
A real one.

254
00:13:48,049 --> 00:13:50,517
I want to spend
spring break with you.

255
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,880
You have high self-esteem, right?

256
00:13:54,989 --> 00:13:56,889
Not after being in here.
It's a nightmare.

257
00:13:56,991 --> 00:14:01,052
<i>Michael, Mom. We've gotta go now.
I created a diversion.</i>

258
00:14:01,162 --> 00:14:02,925
You're gonna love this.

259
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:05,055
I'd like to check my uncle in
for rehab.

260
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,066
I thought we were
buying me some pants.

261
00:14:07,168 --> 00:14:10,069
Oh, of course you think that.
You're high as a kite!

262
00:14:10,171 --> 00:14:13,368
He needs help! Any-
He needs help! He needs help!

263
00:14:16,644 --> 00:14:20,546
<i>And so Lucille was able
to meet with Kitty at Señor Tadpole's.</i>

264
00:14:20,648 --> 00:14:22,912
I want what's due to me-
a Bluth son.

265
00:14:23,017 --> 00:14:25,417
And I know
you have the material.

266
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,215
<i>Kitty was right. Ten years earlier...</i>

267
00:14:28,322 --> 00:14:31,849
<i>George Sr. Was taking an
experimental hair growth drug.</i>

268
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:34,052
<i>Fearing damage to his fertility...</i>

269
00:14:34,161 --> 00:14:36,994
<i>he froze a specimen
ofhis reproductive material...</i>

270
00:14:37,098 --> 00:14:40,261
<i>in case he ever wanted
another child.</i>

271
00:14:40,368 --> 00:14:42,427
<i>Soon, news came out that the drug...</i>

272
00:14:42,536 --> 00:14:44,766
<i>although somewhat successful...</i>

273
00:14:44,872 --> 00:14:48,000
<i>wreaked havoc
on the central nervous system.</i>

274
00:14:51,312 --> 00:14:55,078
<i>So what do you need me for?
He's not taking the monkey drug anymore.</i>

275
00:14:55,182 --> 00:14:58,174
- And you're the one who's got him. Not me.
- Oh, you know why.

276
00:14:58,286 --> 00:15:01,414
He won't touch me. He said
he doesn't cheat on his wife anymore.

277
00:15:01,522 --> 00:15:03,090
<i>- He said that?
- Drinking contest!</i>

278
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:05,354
<i>- He said that?
- Drinking contest!</i>

279
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:08,451
<i>Tell you what.
I'll drink you for it.</i>

280
00:15:08,562 --> 00:15:11,827
Oh, I heard you don't handle
your booze so well anymore.

281
00:15:11,933 --> 00:15:13,833
So this should be easy for you.

282
00:15:16,804 --> 00:15:19,500
That one didn't count.

283
00:15:19,607 --> 00:15:23,008
<i>And Michael met up with Gob
to try and find their father.</i>

284
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:25,271
I got it.
From the banana stand freezer.

285
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:28,280
The exact same kind of cooler
that's in the photo with Dad.

286
00:15:28,382 --> 00:15:31,044
- What do we need another cooler for?
- Ah, poor Michael.

287
00:15:31,152 --> 00:15:33,143
You do not think like a magician.

288
00:15:33,254 --> 00:15:35,381
- Such a "How'd he do dat?"
- Uh-huh.

289
00:15:35,489 --> 00:15:38,151
It's a classic bait and switch.
This is a decoy cooler.

290
00:15:38,259 --> 00:15:41,490
We take it in, switch it with the one
from the photo and get out of there.

291
00:15:41,595 --> 00:15:44,462
Kitty comes back. Everything's normal.
It's like we were never there.

292
00:15:44,565 --> 00:15:48,501
- But Dad's gone.
- Long gone. But it buys us
all the time in the world.

293
00:15:48,602 --> 00:15:51,696
I got it back, Mikey.
The self-confidence. I am a magician!

294
00:15:51,806 --> 00:15:53,899
I'm saying, when Kitty comes back,
notices Dad's gone...

295
00:15:54,008 --> 00:15:56,943
first thing she's gonna do is check
the cooler, see if the evidence is still there.

296
00:15:57,044 --> 00:15:58,944
Buys us, like, one second.

297
00:15:59,046 --> 00:16:00,980
- I am a worthless magician.
- Not true.

298
00:16:01,082 --> 00:16:02,811
- I can't even do one simple trick.
- Come on.

299
00:16:02,917 --> 00:16:05,044
- I'm covered in sweat. Look at me!
- It's a great trick.

300
00:16:05,152 --> 00:16:08,747
- Would've been flawless
if you had a decoy Dad too.
- Damn it.

301
00:16:08,856 --> 00:16:12,155
And I used a guy that looked
just like him in my last bait and switch.

302
00:16:12,259 --> 00:16:16,923
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

303
00:16:17,031 --> 00:16:19,192
- Well, I'm no longer needed here.
- No, no, no.

304
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,200
I think the cooler's
actually gonna help us.

305
00:16:21,302 --> 00:16:23,497
The extra second that it buys us
could be the difference.

306
00:16:23,604 --> 00:16:26,869
Great. Just give me a couple
of minutes to catch my breath.

307
00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:35,387
<i>Lucille, minutes out of rehab...</i>

308
00:16:35,492 --> 00:16:38,325
<i>was engaging in a drinking contest...</i>

309
00:16:38,428 --> 00:16:40,692
<i>at the behest ofher son.</i>

310
00:16:40,797 --> 00:16:43,095
<i>. Let me know when you're ready, dear.
- She's mixing!</i>

311
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,997
<i>While right outside the bar-</i>

312
00:16:45,102 --> 00:16:47,332
I know what the shape
of a banana reminds you of...

313
00:16:47,437 --> 00:16:49,701
and I know that when I say
"nuts," it makes you giggle.

314
00:16:49,806 --> 00:16:52,707
But do you have any other response...

315
00:16:52,809 --> 00:16:55,607
to "here's a banana with nuts"?

316
00:16:58,348 --> 00:17:01,374
Why are we even going after
this idiot demographic?

317
00:17:01,485 --> 00:17:04,648
Don't you get it? They're not even eating these.
They just like saying bananas and nuts.

318
00:17:04,755 --> 00:17:07,690
And I won't- I won't tell you why.
That's your father's job.

319
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:10,351
<i>Come on! Let's see
some bananas and nuts!</i>

320
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:13,190
Oh, perhaps we should
just pull their pants off.

321
00:17:13,296 --> 00:17:16,231
Hey, what the hell do you think
you're doing? This is where we shoot.

322
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,961
Yeah, well, you've got competition now,
'cause we're making our own video.

323
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:21,367
Will you just get over it!
It's nudity.

324
00:17:21,471 --> 00:17:24,031
Just because you're ashamed of your body
doesn't mean everybody should be.

325
00:17:24,141 --> 00:17:28,305
Oh, really? Well, let's see how you feel
about what you're packing.

326
00:17:28,412 --> 00:17:31,745
You're a- never-nude?

327
00:17:31,848 --> 00:17:35,113
<i>You're asking girls to take their tops off,
and you can't even be naked?</i>

328
00:17:35,218 --> 00:17:40,087
- I've gotta get this.
- Lindsay, I've already got it.

329
00:17:41,324 --> 00:17:44,782
I'm back into cutoffs. Lindsay?

330
00:17:44,895 --> 00:17:46,795
I didn't see you at the convention.

331
00:17:46,897 --> 00:17:49,331
- No, I was in Germany. I teleconferenced in.
- Ohhh.

332
00:17:49,433 --> 00:17:51,924
- Did you go to the seminar on chafing?
- Dr. Schoenweiss. Yes.

333
00:17:52,035 --> 00:17:54,936
This is never gonna work. There's
too many people, too many rooms.

334
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:57,404
Michael, we can't give up.
This is important.

335
00:17:57,507 --> 00:18:01,238
Believe me. I'd rather be down at the beach
having drinks, howling at chicks.

336
00:18:02,846 --> 00:18:04,336
Dad?

337
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,685
Oh, my boys. Yes, you-
you came for me.

338
00:18:09,786 --> 00:18:13,449
Yeah, hi, Dad. Uh, Gob's gonna get you
out of those handcuffs. Can you do it?

339
00:18:13,557 --> 00:18:16,219
- One handcuff key coming up.
- Great.

340
00:18:19,629 --> 00:18:21,597
What the hell are you doing?

341
00:18:21,698 --> 00:18:23,928
Swallowed a key just in case
I ended up doing a show.

342
00:18:24,034 --> 00:18:26,764
Come on. This is disgusting.

343
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:29,771
<i>- I'm doing this for you.
- This continued for some time...</i>

344
00:18:29,873 --> 00:18:31,966
<i>while Michael switched out the coolers.</i>

345
00:18:32,075 --> 00:18:34,441
- Why are you switching out the coolers?
- It buys us time, Dad.

346
00:18:34,544 --> 00:18:36,671
<i>- What? Like a second?
- Don't worry about it, okay?</i>

347
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,613
When I get this evidence out of here,
I'm turning it right into the court.

348
00:18:39,716 --> 00:18:42,947
Are you kidding? I don't care if the evidence
gets out there. It gets me off the hook.

349
00:18:43,053 --> 00:18:45,544
<i>- What are you saying? This exonerates you?
- I told you before.</i>

350
00:18:45,655 --> 00:18:50,319
I was a patsy. I was set up.
I am tired of looking guilty.

351
00:18:50,427 --> 00:18:53,624
Well, that's- that's great.

352
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:57,960
Now who's a horrible magician?

353
00:18:58,068 --> 00:19:01,970
That is a crown, you horse's ass.

354
00:19:02,072 --> 00:19:04,734
- How does that make you feel?
- Awesome.

355
00:19:04,841 --> 00:19:09,471
<i>And George Michael caught up
with Maeby, determined to save her self-esteem.</i>

356
00:19:09,579 --> 00:19:12,412
Look, I don't want to ruin your fun,
but I hate to see guys treat you like this.

357
00:19:12,516 --> 00:19:15,212
You're better than that.
To me, anyway. You're-

358
00:19:15,318 --> 00:19:17,309
- Awesome?
- No, I was gonna say you're-

359
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:20,719
you're like this flower,
and I know it's springtime...

360
00:19:20,824 --> 00:19:23,292
but I just- I'd hate
to see you get plucked...

361
00:19:23,393 --> 00:19:26,055
by someone who doesn't even care
that you're blossoming.

362
00:19:26,163 --> 00:19:29,155
That's what I've been waiting to hear.

363
00:19:30,934 --> 00:19:32,993
<i>Maeby was referring to the dialogue...</i>

364
00:19:33,103 --> 00:19:37,062
<i>but George Michael had just rediscovered
his feelings for his cousin.</i>

365
00:19:37,174 --> 00:19:39,472
Hi, Ann. It's-It's George Michael Bluth.

366
00:19:39,576 --> 00:19:42,773
Um, when you get back
into town, we should talk.

367
00:19:46,816 --> 00:19:48,716
Can I get you
anything else, ma'am?

368
00:19:48,818 --> 00:19:51,013
No, thanks.
I have to get back to rehab.

369
00:19:51,121 --> 00:19:54,022
<i>She's in rehab!</i>

370
00:19:54,124 --> 00:19:58,083
<i>And so George Sr. Was free...</i>

371
00:19:58,195 --> 00:20:00,254
<i>and Michael and Gob
absconded with the evidence.</i>

372
00:20:00,363 --> 00:20:03,264
One heck of a trick
you ended up pullin' in there, Gob.

373
00:20:03,366 --> 00:20:05,391
Truthfully, that wasn't part of the act.

374
00:20:05,502 --> 00:20:08,403
I was actually trying to get the key
to come out of my mouth.

375
00:20:08,505 --> 00:20:12,942
That part was very surprising, but I'm talking
about how you helped me get Dad out of there.

376
00:20:13,043 --> 00:20:15,603
Thanks to you, this family
could end up being okay.

377
00:20:15,712 --> 00:20:19,239
<i>And Gob had finally
overcome his own low self-esteem.</i>

378
00:20:19,349 --> 00:20:23,251
Hey, aren't you that magician
who always embarrasses himself?

379
00:20:23,353 --> 00:20:26,789
Not anymore. Not anymore.

380
00:20:29,826 --> 00:20:32,420
<i>- Gob!
- But he lost it...</i>

381
00:20:32,529 --> 00:20:34,895
<i>along with the exonerating evidence.</i>

382
00:20:34,998 --> 00:20:38,991
They're laughing, Michael. They're laughing.

383
00:20:39,102 --> 00:20:42,230
<i>And that's how you narrate a story.</i>

384
00:20:42,339 --> 00:20:45,570
<i>On the next Arrested Development.</i>

385
00:20:45,675 --> 00:20:47,734
<i>Lucille gets some
disturbing information.</i>

386
00:20:47,844 --> 00:20:51,109
- Did you get the evidence?
- Yes, and then Gob ruined it.

387
00:20:51,214 --> 00:20:55,241
After all the trouble we went through to
switch coolers with the one from the banana stand.

388
00:20:55,352 --> 00:20:58,913
The one in the freezer? I was storing
very important things there.

389
00:20:59,022 --> 00:21:03,482
<i>And Kitty finds
what she's been looking for.</i>

390
00:21:08,732 --> 00:21:13,965
There was 250 c.c.'s of your
father in that banana stand!

391
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:16,038
No touching.
