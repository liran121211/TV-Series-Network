1
00:00:01,007 --> 00:00:04,408
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:06,501
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:06,612 --> 00:00:08,603
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:14,153 --> 00:00:15,848
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

5
00:00:18,024 --> 00:00:22,427
<i>Michael Bluth was working
at home when he noticed something unusual.</i>

6
00:00:26,632 --> 00:00:28,532
That can't be good.

7
00:00:28,634 --> 00:00:32,035
Okay, I checked underneath,
and there is a problem.

8
00:00:32,138 --> 00:00:34,606
- You know this isn't a real house?
- It's a model house.

9
00:00:34,707 --> 00:00:38,108
Well, the drain pipes aren't hooked up.
Just empty under the house.

10
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,407
<i>- Plus, there's a lot ofblue paint down there.
- And some pieces of denim?</i>

11
00:00:41,514 --> 00:00:43,414
- Yeah.
- We've got a guy like that here.

12
00:00:43,516 --> 00:00:45,711
<i>Well, that's why
your living room is sinking.</i>

13
00:00:45,818 --> 00:00:48,548
And I think the city's
gonna have to red-tag it.

14
00:00:48,654 --> 00:00:50,417
The city is sending out an inspector.

15
00:00:50,523 --> 00:00:53,321
They're gonna be crawling over every inch
of this place. You're going to need to leave.

16
00:00:53,426 --> 00:00:56,725
Where the hell do you want me to go?
Back to your mother's?

17
00:00:56,829 --> 00:01:00,265
I believe there's a freeloading loser
in my bed.

18
00:01:00,366 --> 00:01:02,391
Buster just lost a hand.
He's going through a lot.

19
00:01:02,501 --> 00:01:04,401
I'm talking about Oscar.

20
00:01:04,503 --> 00:01:07,131
Oh, yes. Your brother.
I can see why that would bug you.

21
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:12,006
<i>In fact, Oscar had stayed with
Lucille primarily to reconnect with Buster...</i>

22
00:01:12,111 --> 00:01:15,979
<i>- whom he secretly believed to be his natural son.
- Hey, Uncle.</i>

23
00:01:16,082 --> 00:01:17,811
I feel so responsible for that.

24
00:01:17,917 --> 00:01:21,250
<i>Oscar had gotten injured on a shoddy device
George Sr. Had invented...</i>

25
00:01:21,353 --> 00:01:25,084
<i>- when he forgot Buster
was wearing a prosthetic hand.
- Buster! The Cornballer!</i>

26
00:01:27,693 --> 00:01:29,957
- It's my father's fault!
- My fault?

27
00:01:30,062 --> 00:01:33,225
I was trying to keep you
from burning yourself, you idiot!

28
00:01:33,332 --> 00:01:36,768
I mean, yes, yes.
George Sr. Sure rushed this to market.

29
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:39,463
<i>The only reason she likes him
is he has hair.</i>

30
00:01:39,572 --> 00:01:42,905
And the only reason he has any
is because he's never had any stress.

31
00:01:43,008 --> 00:01:46,375
Yeah? Well, you could save me
a lot of stress if you just turned yourself in.

32
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,677
No, never. I can't go back to the joint.
No, I cannot go back there.

33
00:01:54,086 --> 00:01:58,284
- Hey, man!

34
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,790
Yeah!

35
00:02:03,562 --> 00:02:06,827
- It's a hell-hole.
- I finally got the court to try you in absentia.

36
00:02:06,932 --> 00:02:09,400
Which means we're not supposed to
have any idea where you are.

37
00:02:09,502 --> 00:02:12,960
So you don't have to go to prison,
but you can't stay here.

38
00:02:13,072 --> 00:02:17,406
<i>Remember that French movie we tried to
sneak into once- Dangerous Cousins?</i>

39
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,705
No, l-Why? Did we-

40
00:02:19,812 --> 00:02:23,248
I don't remember that, no.

41
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:25,408
<i>George Michael remembered very well.</i>

42
00:02:25,518 --> 00:02:30,217
<i>In fact, he currently had a copy of the DVD
hidden in his sock drawer.</i>

43
00:02:30,322 --> 00:02:32,051
Kind of.

44
00:02:32,158 --> 00:02:34,217
Why do you ask?

45
00:02:34,326 --> 00:02:37,989
I got passes to the premiere of the American
remake. Supposed to be great.

46
00:02:38,097 --> 00:02:40,190
<i>It wasn't great, and Maeby knew it.</i>

47
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:45,202
<i>The studio at which she'd finagled a job
had hoped to avoid controversy...</i>

48
00:02:45,304 --> 00:02:48,933
<i>by artlessly explaining that the two leads
weren't biological cousins.</i>

49
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:51,236
<i>Shut up and kiss me!</i>

50
00:02:52,645 --> 00:02:54,613
- Where is everybody?
- They've been fired.

51
00:02:54,713 --> 00:02:57,614
And you gotta fix this,
or you're gonna be fired too.

52
00:02:57,716 --> 00:03:01,083
- Cut it down if you have to.
- But it's only 71 minutes long.

53
00:03:01,187 --> 00:03:04,179
And it's only, like, 63 minutes long.
So bring Ann.

54
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:06,485
No, that's not her kind of thing.

55
00:03:06,592 --> 00:03:10,892
I mean, if it maintains any of the complex
eroticism of the French original anyway.

56
00:03:10,996 --> 00:03:13,590
I like the way they think.

57
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:16,167
<i>And later, at the office,
Michael had another surprise.</i>

58
00:03:16,268 --> 00:03:18,168
This can't be good.

59
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:21,296
"Michael, it saddens me
greatly to say to you...

60
00:03:21,407 --> 00:03:24,399
"that I can no longer work
at the Bluth Company.

61
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:27,377
- You've been a great boss"-
- I'm sorry, Tobias. Do you work here?

62
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:31,779
Do I work- I developed an eating disorder
being your assistant, Michael.

63
00:03:31,884 --> 00:03:33,875
I never saw you at the desk.

64
00:03:33,986 --> 00:03:36,921
Well, excuse me if I was too busy
on my knees in front of the toilet, Michael.

65
00:03:38,557 --> 00:03:40,457
"I have a tremendous opportunity...

66
00:03:40,559 --> 00:03:42,459
"now that the Blue Man Group
has dropped their cease-and-desist...

67
00:03:42,561 --> 00:03:44,495
"and invited me to audition in Las Vegas.

68
00:03:44,597 --> 00:03:46,428
Also, I've developed
some issues with food"-

69
00:03:46,532 --> 00:03:49,968
I'm sorry to interrupt one more time.
Is this the real Blue Man Group this time?

70
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:53,800
<i>Tobias had recently been asked
to address a group of depressed men...</i>

71
00:03:53,906 --> 00:03:56,568
<i>who had been described
over the phone as blue.</i>

72
00:04:02,414 --> 00:04:05,406
I feel like a- idiot.

73
00:04:05,517 --> 00:04:08,953
<i>Fortunately, I found a wonderful circle
of men to get me through that.</i>

74
00:04:09,054 --> 00:04:13,252
Oh, before I forget, your old secretary,
Kitty Sanchez, called...

75
00:04:13,359 --> 00:04:14,849
and wanted to meet with you.

76
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,088
- I penciled her in for 4:00 today.
- Why didn't you tell me?

77
00:04:18,197 --> 00:04:19,926
Oh, this is my fault too?

78
00:04:20,032 --> 00:04:23,263
Everything- No. No!
I will not let this make me eat!

79
00:04:25,437 --> 00:04:28,372
<i>So get this. Tomorrow I gotta go on record
and say I don't know where Dad is.</i>

80
00:04:28,474 --> 00:04:31,500
And now Kitty Sanchez
wants to meet with me.

81
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:34,044
<i>And meetings with Kitty
had never ended well.</i>

82
00:04:34,146 --> 00:04:36,808
- Say good-bye to these.
- Spring break! Whoo!

83
00:04:36,915 --> 00:04:39,213
<i>- Perhaps this'll jog your memory.
- Oh! They're crooked!</i>

84
00:04:39,318 --> 00:04:41,843
Plus, Dad will not leave the attic,
which means he's gonna get caught...

85
00:04:41,954 --> 00:04:43,854
which means I'm gonna
get caught for hiding him.

86
00:04:43,956 --> 00:04:46,686
Well, why don't you get Gob
to do your dirty work for you?

87
00:04:46,792 --> 00:04:49,693
<i>Shall I knock Dad out
and chain him to a pipe somewhere?</i>

88
00:04:49,795 --> 00:04:52,229
Or should I risk another
herpes outbreak with Kitty?

89
00:04:52,331 --> 00:04:55,459
<i>- Which is it this time?
- Definitely not one of those two things.</i>

90
00:04:55,567 --> 00:04:57,467
But are you upset about something, Gob?

91
00:04:57,569 --> 00:05:01,528
<i>I made you a thank-you gift last week
about which you haven't said word one.</i>

92
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:05,201
Come on.
You asked me for $5,000...

93
00:05:05,311 --> 00:05:07,836
so that you could invest
in a Franklin CD.

94
00:05:07,946 --> 00:05:10,972
Now, I assumed that you were
talking about the mutual fund...

95
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:13,244
and not a compact disc
of you singing to your hand.

96
00:05:13,352 --> 00:05:16,412
<i>Gob had recently made
a recording ofhis ventriloquism act.</i>

97
00:05:16,522 --> 00:05:18,752
"Franklin Comes Alive." Take one.

98
00:05:18,857 --> 00:05:21,519
<i>He hoped it would break down racial
barriers and maybe be a crossover hit.</i>

99
00:05:21,627 --> 00:05:24,653
It ain't easy bein' white

100
00:05:24,763 --> 00:05:27,698
It ain't easy bein' brown

101
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,236
<i>All this pressure to be bright</i>

102
00:05:31,337 --> 00:05:34,898
I got childrens all over town

103
00:05:35,007 --> 00:05:38,170
Sometimes-
Hey, where'd the guy go?

104
00:05:38,277 --> 00:05:41,508
I tried to express something to you
in a couple of those numbers...

105
00:05:41,613 --> 00:05:44,343
and maybe, just maybe,
heal this country a little bit.

106
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:47,078
<i>But you, you didn't even
bother to listen to it.</i>

107
00:05:47,186 --> 00:05:51,680
I did listen to it.
L-l-l-I am listening to it. Gob. Hey.

108
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:55,351
Maybe the reason I didn't say anything
is 'cause I didn't want to embarrass you.

109
00:05:55,461 --> 00:05:57,554
It's my favorite, favorite record.

110
00:05:57,663 --> 00:05:59,756
Well, then you-
you- up.

111
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:03,424
Because I am so embarrassed.

112
00:06:03,535 --> 00:06:06,231
It's a good CD.
It's a really good CD.

113
00:06:06,338 --> 00:06:09,535
- I can't believe that you love it.
- I love it so much.

114
00:06:09,641 --> 00:06:13,304
Oh, God. Oh, God, look at us.

115
00:06:13,412 --> 00:06:15,778
Crying like a couple of girls.

116
00:06:15,881 --> 00:06:20,250
Aw, you're the only one crying.
But I love the music.

117
00:06:20,352 --> 00:06:22,377
<i>- And the card with your face on it?
- And the healing.</i>

118
00:06:22,488 --> 00:06:24,388
Home run!

119
00:06:26,658 --> 00:06:29,092
We'll do your dirty work
for you, Mikey.

120
00:06:30,996 --> 00:06:34,830
- You leave the rough stuff to Franklin and me.
- Now I gotta listen to that CD.

121
00:06:34,933 --> 00:06:36,628
<i>- Hi, Dad.
- Right.</i>

122
00:06:36,735 --> 00:06:39,226
You remember Franklin.

123
00:06:39,338 --> 00:06:41,898
<i>- Hey, Franklin.
- My man!</i>

124
00:06:42,007 --> 00:06:44,999
- How 'bout some tongue?
- Wha- Oh-

125
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,738
<i>But Franklin didn't want to kiss at all.</i>

126
00:06:47,846 --> 00:06:50,280
<i>Gob had soaked
the puppet's mouth in ether.</i>

127
00:06:50,382 --> 00:06:54,614
<i>And downstairs, Tobias shared
his good news with Lindsay.</i>

128
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,984
"...once in a lifetime."

129
00:06:57,089 --> 00:06:59,990
Tobias, I am not uprooting my life
and moving to Vegas.

130
00:07:00,092 --> 00:07:03,357
Maybe this is a sign that our relationship
isn't working, and we should split again.

131
00:07:03,462 --> 00:07:06,989
<i>Wait a second. I thought we were split up,
and this would bring us back together.</i>

132
00:07:07,099 --> 00:07:10,557
Well, maybe the fact that we don't know
if we're together or not...

133
00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:13,035
is a sign that we should split again.

134
00:07:13,138 --> 00:07:15,129
<i>Or stay split up.</i>

135
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,539
Okay, forget about Vegas.
We'll stay here and get back together.

136
00:07:18,644 --> 00:07:23,638
Or stay together and either
rekindle or fan this fire.

137
00:07:23,749 --> 00:07:28,015
<i>And soon, Gob was on his way to
dump his father on the police station steps.</i>

138
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,747
Do you forgive me?

139
00:07:29,855 --> 00:07:33,621
<i>And he decided to let himself off the hook
using his ventriloquist skills.</i>

140
00:07:33,725 --> 00:07:37,320
I cherish you, Gob.
Come here and give me a kiss.

141
00:07:37,429 --> 00:07:40,626
I'm driving, Dad.
Now!

142
00:07:40,732 --> 00:07:43,166
<i>It was weird.</i>

143
00:07:43,268 --> 00:07:48,205
<i>And that's when Gob noticed the CD
and card that he'd made for Michael.</i>

144
00:07:48,307 --> 00:07:51,640
It's not even open. Michael!

145
00:07:51,743 --> 00:07:56,476
<i>Meanwhile, Michael's meeting with Kitty
wasn't as distressing as he'd thought.</i>

146
00:07:56,582 --> 00:08:01,019
The program has changed my life. And I have
a sponsor now. He's famous.

147
00:08:01,119 --> 00:08:03,178
<i>- That's great.
- I can't tell you who he is.</i>

148
00:08:03,288 --> 00:08:07,418
<i>But let's just say that
he was on Night Court.</i>

149
00:08:07,526 --> 00:08:09,653
- Well, you look great.
- I can tell you who it's not.

150
00:08:09,761 --> 00:08:11,661
<i>It's not Bull.
It's not Harry Anderson.</i>

151
00:08:11,763 --> 00:08:12,855
- I got it.
- He's white.

152
00:08:12,965 --> 00:08:15,263
I know who it is.

153
00:08:15,367 --> 00:08:19,428
What happens is, when I don't have
a man in my life, I tend to go a little crazy.

154
00:08:19,538 --> 00:08:21,335
<i>- Mm-hmm.
- But I'm keeping it together now.</i>

155
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,537
And I wanted to tell you I'm not gonna
try to hurt you guys anymore.

156
00:08:26,645 --> 00:08:29,910
- Don't suppose I can get that in writing.
- You did try to blow me up.

157
00:08:30,015 --> 00:08:32,609
- Sorry about that.
- Just don't piss me off again.

158
00:08:35,787 --> 00:08:37,448
You all right?

159
00:08:37,556 --> 00:08:40,923
"Oftentimes the heart acts
without consulting the head, and thusly"-

160
00:08:41,026 --> 00:08:44,689
Oh, I see you wasted no time
in filling my seat hole.

161
00:08:44,796 --> 00:08:49,426
Oh, no, no. I just came by so that you
could say good-bye to these.

162
00:08:49,535 --> 00:08:53,835
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
- It's the last time you're going to be seeing these.

163
00:08:53,939 --> 00:08:56,134
<i>How ironic.
I just found out I'm staying.</i>

164
00:08:56,241 --> 00:08:59,438
- Will you take these back?
- Okay, let's just all put our tops down.

165
00:08:59,545 --> 00:09:01,035
Just put 'em on down.

166
00:09:01,146 --> 00:09:03,114
You're not goin' to Vegas?

167
00:09:03,215 --> 00:09:06,116
Sadly, my wife said no to my dream.

168
00:09:06,218 --> 00:09:10,882
So I shall continue
to toil through this waking life.

169
00:09:10,989 --> 00:09:15,016
Wow, you are so real.
Why can't I meet someone like you?

170
00:09:15,127 --> 00:09:18,688
<i>And Michael decided that he
better keep Kitty occupied with a man.</i>

171
00:09:18,797 --> 00:09:20,697
<i>At least until after his meeting.</i>

172
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:25,327
Hey, gang, I got an idea. Tobias, why don't
you take Kitty out for the afternoon?

173
00:09:25,437 --> 00:09:27,337
Huh?

174
00:09:27,439 --> 00:09:30,465
Are you trying to set up your former
assistant with your current assistant?

175
00:09:30,576 --> 00:09:34,478
What a great idea for a
Hugh Grant-Julia Roberts type movie.

176
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:39,074
I recently heard that the actor, John Larroquette,
was looking for a meaty character piece.

177
00:09:39,184 --> 00:09:40,981
<i>And so, free of obstacles...</i>

178
00:09:41,086 --> 00:09:43,782
<i>Michael prepared
to sign the affidavit...</i>

179
00:09:43,889 --> 00:09:46,619
<i>maintaining he had no idea
where his father was.</i>

180
00:09:46,725 --> 00:09:49,455
You have not been in contact with him.
Are you prepared to do that?

181
00:10:04,142 --> 00:10:05,803
Officers!

182
00:10:05,911 --> 00:10:08,209
Michael, these men are here-
just a little bit early-

183
00:10:08,313 --> 00:10:09,712
because we have
photographic evidence...

184
00:10:09,815 --> 00:10:11,840
which discredits
the affidavit you just signed.

185
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:14,714
Are those balls? 'Cause the last time
we were here, they were balls.

186
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,118
These are not balls. This was taken
with a traffic camera.

187
00:10:17,222 --> 00:10:22,785
<i>It shows you in your car with your father
within the last 24 hours.</i>

188
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,962
I wish they were balls.

189
00:10:30,014 --> 00:10:32,175
<i>Michael was in police custody...</i>

190
00:10:32,282 --> 00:10:35,376
<i>after a photo ofhim helping
his father escape had turned up.</i>

191
00:10:35,486 --> 00:10:37,545
Did you see that picture?
That's you, right?

192
00:10:37,655 --> 00:10:39,816
Were you holdin' up
a photo of me or somethin'?

193
00:10:39,923 --> 00:10:41,982
Of course you don't recognize it.

194
00:10:42,092 --> 00:10:46,085
<i>- It's the card from the CD you didn't even open.
- You found that, did you?</i>

195
00:10:46,196 --> 00:10:48,858
Right between the gearbox
and the "pull back from aircraft" lever.

196
00:10:48,966 --> 00:10:51,833
So this is how you repay me
for how I repay you?

197
00:10:51,935 --> 00:10:53,960
I actually did not get
a chance to listen to it yet.

198
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:56,369
Probably should've told you,
but I didn't want to hurt your feelings.

199
00:10:56,473 --> 00:10:58,270
Oh, you're so sensitive.

200
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:01,173
Just like when you whipped up those tears
talking about how much you loved it.

201
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:05,510
I will listen to it, I promise. But I'm
in a lot of trouble here. Where is Dad?

202
00:11:05,616 --> 00:11:07,516
I've got him stashed away
somewhere safe now.

203
00:11:07,618 --> 00:11:10,348
- Get him, quickly,
otherwise I'm gonna be stuck in here.
- Good!

204
00:11:10,454 --> 00:11:12,251
- I hope you rot in here!
- What-

205
00:11:12,356 --> 00:11:14,756
And guess what else?
Dad kissed me.

206
00:11:14,858 --> 00:11:17,190
How? He looked pretty unconscious
in that picture.

207
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:21,060
I didn't say he was totally into it.

208
00:11:23,467 --> 00:11:25,765
<i>And George Michael
tried to break up with Ann.</i>

209
00:11:25,869 --> 00:11:29,100
I can't go out tomorrow night,
'cause there's this movie premiere at-

210
00:11:29,206 --> 00:11:31,003
It's kinda racy, but-

211
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:34,544
Oh, the cousin one? I can't believe it.
I was just gonna ask you to go.

212
00:11:34,645 --> 00:11:38,411
- You want to see that?
- No, I want to get
the whole church group together.

213
00:11:38,515 --> 00:11:40,415
We're gonna picket those bastards.

214
00:11:40,517 --> 00:11:43,577
<i>George Michael
had only heard Ann swear once before...</i>

215
00:11:43,687 --> 00:11:48,283
<i>when hejoined some ofher youth group
to protest the home of Marc Cherry...</i>

216
00:11:48,392 --> 00:11:50,724
<i>executive producer
of the hit show Desperate Housewives.</i>

217
00:11:50,828 --> 00:11:54,992
<i>- It's a satire!
- There's nothing funny about fornication!</i>

218
00:11:55,099 --> 00:11:56,999
The bastard saw us!

219
00:11:57,101 --> 00:12:01,094
<i>And the promise of another kiss
was too enticing to turn down.</i>

220
00:12:01,205 --> 00:12:03,366
<i>Well, yes. The bastards.</i>

221
00:12:03,474 --> 00:12:07,069
<i>Oscar, meanwhile,
checked in on Buster.</i>

222
00:12:07,177 --> 00:12:10,146
Buster! Buster! Be careful!

223
00:12:10,247 --> 00:12:13,341
- It's not a real hand, remember?
- I'm so forgetful.

224
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:15,645
<i>- I hope you don't get that from me.
- Get that from you?</i>

225
00:12:15,753 --> 00:12:17,414
Do you feel okay?

226
00:12:17,521 --> 00:12:20,513
Just forget it!

227
00:12:20,624 --> 00:12:24,958
I wanted to share my Pop Secret with you.
Oh, but forget it!

228
00:12:25,062 --> 00:12:26,859
Pop secret?

229
00:12:28,132 --> 00:12:31,932
Pop se- Is Oscar my real father?

230
00:12:32,035 --> 00:12:35,027
<i>Lucille, meanwhile,
was on the phone with Michael.</i>

231
00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:38,700
They're keeping me overnight.
Could you tell my son I'm on a business trip?

232
00:12:38,809 --> 00:12:41,277
- Why can't the girl at work do it?
- Tobias?

233
00:12:41,378 --> 00:12:44,108
I sent him on a date with Kitty
to keep her off our backs.

234
00:12:44,214 --> 00:12:47,149
You better hope Lindsay doesn't find out.
She'll be devastated.

235
00:12:47,251 --> 00:12:50,118
- Find out what?
- Your husband's dating Kitty the whore.

236
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,781
<i>He is? That's- That's horrible.</i>

237
00:12:53,891 --> 00:12:55,859
Do I know my daughter?

238
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:57,950
She only wants what she can't have.

239
00:12:58,061 --> 00:12:59,460
Since you're devastating people...

240
00:12:59,563 --> 00:13:01,929
tell Gob I'll be telling the cops
it was him in the truck...

241
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:03,932
so he'll be joining me here.

242
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:06,525
I've got a nice, hard cot
with his name on it.

243
00:13:06,637 --> 00:13:10,471
- You'd do that to your own brother?
- I said "cot."

244
00:13:10,574 --> 00:13:12,804
Where's Mother?

245
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:17,108
You lied to me. You said my father
was my father, but my uncle is my father.

246
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:20,672
My father is my uncle!

247
00:13:20,784 --> 00:13:25,312
<i>At that moment, the guards
played a CD they'd recently confiscated.</i>

248
00:13:25,422 --> 00:13:28,721
Now I got a special thank you
to the brother who made this happen.

249
00:13:28,826 --> 00:13:30,623
Is that Franklin?

250
00:13:45,042 --> 00:13:48,534
<i>Michael realized that
he could never turn his brother in.
- Michael!</i>

251
00:13:48,645 --> 00:13:51,546
<i>- Gob, meanwhile, was having a similar epiphany.</i>

252
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:04,392
Barry, it's Gob.
Tell Michael not to testify.

253
00:14:04,494 --> 00:14:07,190
I'm bringing in Dad.

254
00:14:10,467 --> 00:14:12,367
Franklin.

255
00:14:12,469 --> 00:14:14,699
You've ruined the act, Gob.

256
00:14:16,306 --> 00:14:17,933
<i>And Lucille confronted Oscar.</i>

257
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:21,738
- You told him you were his father?
- I did no such thing!

258
00:14:21,845 --> 00:14:23,437
- You're high!
- You're drunk!

259
00:14:23,547 --> 00:14:25,981
Not this time.
I've had enough of you.

260
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,711
So say good-bye to these,
because it's the last time-

261
00:14:30,888 --> 00:14:33,220
<i>And Ann in a protest at the theater.</i>

262
00:14:33,323 --> 00:14:36,053
George Michael?
Are you protesting this?

263
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:39,094
- This isn't the line?
- Yes, he is protesting this.

264
00:14:39,196 --> 00:14:41,130
He even helped me make the signs.

265
00:14:41,231 --> 00:14:44,257
Well, only mine and the one that says,
"This is a tricky, gray area."

266
00:14:44,368 --> 00:14:46,393
- What are you guys protesting?
- It's a disgusting movie...

267
00:14:46,503 --> 00:14:48,596
about cousins
who are into each other.

268
00:14:48,705 --> 00:14:50,332
Are there any more seats?

269
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,807
Yeah. It's the best 52 minutes
you'll spend all day.

270
00:14:53,911 --> 00:14:56,106
Oh, no. We're making it worse.

271
00:14:56,213 --> 00:14:59,011
Prepare to be swallowed
into the depths of hell!

272
00:14:59,116 --> 00:15:02,517
- I guess that means no kiss?
- I'm not really in the mood for a kiss.

273
00:15:02,619 --> 00:15:04,849
This isn't Marc Cherry's house.

274
00:15:11,528 --> 00:15:14,326
- Where's your dad?
- I don't know. I just got here.

275
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,763
Oh, that's right.
Mother told me he went to jail.

276
00:15:16,867 --> 00:15:19,131
I'm so mad at her.

277
00:15:19,236 --> 00:15:21,431
- Guess who I just found out my father is?
- Jail?

278
00:15:21,538 --> 00:15:24,098
Oscar! He didn't mean to tell me,
but I figured it out.

279
00:15:24,207 --> 00:15:27,870
- No, I mean, my dad is in jail?
- I wouldn't worry about it. Barry's very good.

280
00:15:27,978 --> 00:15:33,109
<i>I'm going to take a long shower. I don't
even want to smell like Mother anymore.</i>

281
00:15:33,216 --> 00:15:35,207
I don't think we're supposed
to shower right now, Bus-

282
00:15:35,319 --> 00:15:36,980
- Tobias back yet?
- No.

283
00:15:37,087 --> 00:15:39,214
Oh, my God. He's really out with her.

284
00:15:39,323 --> 00:15:40,984
- Are you drunk?
- Not enough.

285
00:15:41,091 --> 00:15:43,958
I pushed him right into
someone else's skanky, bony arms.

286
00:15:44,061 --> 00:15:46,029
Well, let me tell you something,
George Michael.

287
00:15:46,129 --> 00:15:49,030
You have to grab love while you have it.
Don't let it get away.

288
00:15:49,132 --> 00:15:50,463
Oh, there you are.

289
00:15:50,567 --> 00:15:53,798
Oh, Maeby, everything's fine.
Your daddy's just out.

290
00:15:53,904 --> 00:15:55,633
Yeah, we're doing great.

291
00:15:55,739 --> 00:15:58,333
Mommy's gonna take a bath
with a bottle of wine.

292
00:15:58,442 --> 00:16:00,342
- I don't know if we're supposed to use-
- So get this.

293
00:16:00,444 --> 00:16:04,710
All the press actually made the premiere a hit.
There's lines for the next show.

294
00:16:04,815 --> 00:16:07,306
Thanks, buddy.

295
00:16:07,417 --> 00:16:11,410
Hey, look at that.
We didn't get swallowed up into hell.

296
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:17,916
<i>And that's when George Michael
finally got close to Maeby...</i>

297
00:16:18,028 --> 00:16:21,054
<i>who, by the way, might not
be his biological cousin.</i>

298
00:16:21,164 --> 00:16:25,658
<i>Just then, Gob came home to retrieve
his father from where he'd stashed him.</i>

299
00:16:25,769 --> 00:16:28,567
- Dad's gonna be crushed.
- You don't have to tell him!

300
00:16:28,672 --> 00:16:31,334
<i>But Gob was referring
to his own father...</i>

301
00:16:31,441 --> 00:16:34,604
<i>who he had hidden under the house.</i>

302
00:16:34,711 --> 00:16:36,576
Uh-oh.

303
00:16:38,636 --> 00:16:42,299
<i>Gob had hidden his father
under a house that had just collapsed.</i>

304
00:16:42,406 --> 00:16:44,966
Children, you're small.
Crawl under there.

305
00:16:45,076 --> 00:16:47,476
<i>- We don't want to go under there.
- He's not under there.</i>

306
00:16:47,578 --> 00:16:49,478
He got away. Thank God.

307
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:53,812
<i>But then Gob remembered that this meant
Michael would have to go to prison.</i>

308
00:16:55,119 --> 00:16:57,587
- We-
- l-

309
00:16:59,123 --> 00:17:02,149
<i>And Michael and Barry
made their way to the arraignment.</i>

310
00:17:02,259 --> 00:17:04,819
Gob is bringing your father.
Everything is going to work out fine.

311
00:17:04,929 --> 00:17:09,195
I wish they'd hurry up.
But I gotta tell you, I am a little torn.

312
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:13,396
My father, he has created
a lot of problems for the family...

313
00:17:13,504 --> 00:17:17,270
and by staying in the attic he was insuring
I would go to jail with him, but-

314
00:17:19,243 --> 00:17:21,143
Well, maybe I'm not so torn.

315
00:17:21,245 --> 00:17:23,008
- Michael. Barry.
- Hey, Gob.

316
00:17:23,114 --> 00:17:26,277
- Where's Dad?
- Great news. Dad wasn't crushed to death.

317
00:17:26,384 --> 00:17:28,045
<i>- Was there risk of that?
- Yes.</i>

318
00:17:28,152 --> 00:17:29,710
Well, I handcuffed him
under the house.

319
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,948
But he got free- the pipes I chained him
to weren't connected to anything.

320
00:17:33,057 --> 00:17:36,117
- Oh, I'm not prepared for this case.
- Are you insane?

321
00:17:36,227 --> 00:17:41,597
- No "thank you" for trying?
- I'm sick of you needing constant
validation for screwing up.

322
00:17:41,699 --> 00:17:46,193
Let me tell you what's gonna happen.
I'm gonna tell them it was you in the stair car.

323
00:17:46,303 --> 00:17:49,272
Well, let me tell you
what's gonna happen.

324
00:17:49,373 --> 00:17:52,706
First, I'm gonna beat the crap out of you,
then I'm gonna call an ambulance.

325
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:55,711
Then knowing you, I'm gonna have
to wait for some kind of an apology.

326
00:17:57,782 --> 00:17:59,716
Come here!

327
00:18:02,153 --> 00:18:06,055
<i>As the boys set to once again
fighting in front of the courthouse-</i>

328
00:18:06,157 --> 00:18:08,921
<i>- Stop it! Stop it!
- the family began to show up for the arraignment.</i>

329
00:18:09,026 --> 00:18:13,326
<i>I know you're in the middle of something,
but I'm afraid I can't work for you today.</i>

330
00:18:13,431 --> 00:18:15,456
I'm going to Vegas with Kitty.

331
00:18:15,566 --> 00:18:18,262
<i>But Lindsay wasn't
about to lose her man without a fight.</i>

332
00:18:18,369 --> 00:18:20,394
Over my dead body!

333
00:18:20,504 --> 00:18:22,734
<i>Oh, my-</i>

334
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:27,106
Hey! Hey! I said- I said enough!

335
00:18:27,211 --> 00:18:28,974
Now, stop it.

336
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:33,278
I am so tired of this family fighting.
The anger ends now.

337
00:18:33,384 --> 00:18:37,787
You're brothers, and brothers
stick together no matter what.

338
00:18:38,889 --> 00:18:40,823
<i>Families stick together.</i>

339
00:18:40,925 --> 00:18:44,656
I have torn this family apart
with my lies and my cowardice...

340
00:18:44,762 --> 00:18:47,492
but that comes to an end now.

341
00:18:47,598 --> 00:18:49,156
<i>So I'm turning myself in.</i>

342
00:18:49,266 --> 00:18:52,758
I don't want you to come
and visit me in prison this time.

343
00:18:54,705 --> 00:18:57,299
'Cause you deserve Oscar now.

344
00:19:03,914 --> 00:19:06,314
<i>Tobias, I actually fought for you.</i>

345
00:19:06,417 --> 00:19:08,317
I can't believe it.

346
00:19:08,419 --> 00:19:12,219
<i>- I'm going to Vegas with Kitty.
- Huh?</i>

347
00:19:19,296 --> 00:19:21,958
Oh, George, I've lost you again.

348
00:19:22,066 --> 00:19:24,500
Take back Oscar, Mother.

349
00:19:24,602 --> 00:19:26,502
I think I lost him too.

350
00:19:26,604 --> 00:19:29,630
<i>In fact, Oscar
was on his way out of town...</i>

351
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:32,140
<i>when he was approached by George Sr...</i>

352
00:19:32,243 --> 00:19:34,211
<i>who had just escaped
from under the house.</i>

353
00:19:34,311 --> 00:19:38,338
I want you to turn me in so you can
get the reward, take care of the family.

354
00:19:38,449 --> 00:19:40,644
Why would you do that for me?

355
00:19:40,751 --> 00:19:42,378
Because we're brothers.

356
00:19:44,054 --> 00:19:48,013
<i>Later, while George Sr. Was shaving
his unconscious brother's head...</i>

357
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:52,528
<i>he wondered whether there really was
a reward, and ifhe could get it.</i>

358
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:57,465
<i>But there was no time, and getting even
with his brother was reward enough.</i>

359
00:20:00,304 --> 00:20:04,104
<i>So it was Oscar who was going to be
spending a little time alone in prison.</i>

360
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:07,666
I guess Dad finally came through for us.
He actually made a sacrifice.

361
00:20:07,778 --> 00:20:09,939
Although who knows
what he's up to.

362
00:20:10,047 --> 00:20:13,847
We should just stay away from him,
let him have a little time alone in prison.

363
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:16,749
He is right about one thing, though.
We're brothers. We shouldn't be fighting.

364
00:20:16,854 --> 00:20:19,186
- We cannot afford to lose each other.
- I can't.

365
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:22,054
- I already lost a brother today.
- Franklin?

366
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,923
Well, I didn't lose him.
But he's all puckered and white.

367
00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:27,862
On the plus side, you can take him
to lunch at the club now.

368
00:20:27,965 --> 00:20:30,365
That's the kind of joke
he would have loved.

369
00:20:30,467 --> 00:20:32,367
Oh, man!

370
00:20:36,373 --> 00:20:39,934
- Please don't do this.

371
00:20:40,044 --> 00:20:42,205
- All right.

372
00:20:44,648 --> 00:20:47,981
<i>On the next season
of Arrested Development.</i>

373
00:20:48,085 --> 00:20:50,610
I burned them on a Cornballer.

374
00:20:50,721 --> 00:20:55,124
<i>Oscar, robbed of his fingerprints,
has difficulty proving his identity...</i>

375
00:20:55,226 --> 00:20:57,126
My hair's gonna grow back.
You'll see.

376
00:20:57,228 --> 00:20:59,162
<i>Tobias and Kitty go to Vegas...</i>

377
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:02,426
<i>- only to find that his dream job has been filled.
- You found someone already?</i>

378
00:21:02,533 --> 00:21:04,398
Just came out of nowhere, this guy.

379
00:21:04,501 --> 00:21:08,301
<i>And the great thing is,
he's never out of character.</i>

380
00:21:08,405 --> 00:21:12,569
<i>And George Sr. Turns out to be right
about the effects of stress.</i>

381
00:21:12,676 --> 00:21:15,406
What's happening to me?
Why won't it grow back?
