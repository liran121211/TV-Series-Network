1
00:00:02,521 --> 00:00:04,421
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:04,523 --> 00:00:06,514
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:06,625 --> 00:00:08,616
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:14,133 --> 00:00:15,794
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

5
00:00:19,304 --> 00:00:22,068
<i>Michael Bluth
had scheduled a meeting with Stan Sitwell...</i>

6
00:00:22,174 --> 00:00:24,608
<i>the Bluth Company's
chief competitor.</i>

7
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:26,769
Why are we having this meeting at home?

8
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:30,679
Let him see he's not the only one
who builds solid houses, you know?

9
00:00:32,751 --> 00:00:35,481
I think he'll be pretty impressed,
knock on wood.

10
00:00:39,558 --> 00:00:44,018
<i>In fact, Michael was meeting
at home at the behest ofhis fugitive father.</i>

11
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:45,926
<i>...knock on wood.</i>

12
00:00:46,031 --> 00:00:48,522
Don't you find the timing
of this meeting a little suspicious?

13
00:00:48,634 --> 00:00:51,933
<i>Right before we play
his company in softball?</i>

14
00:00:52,037 --> 00:00:55,006
No, no. Our business is in trouble,
and I think he sees an opportunity.

15
00:00:55,107 --> 00:00:58,076
So, I figured the guy's a family man,
why not invite him over...

16
00:00:58,177 --> 00:01:00,805
- let him see us in our element.
- I hope you don't mean the whole family...

17
00:01:00,913 --> 00:01:03,609
- 'cause George Michael's off with Ann.
- Ann?

18
00:01:03,715 --> 00:01:07,014
<i>Hmm. That'll play well with Sitwell.
"Where's your son?" "He's out with Ann."</i>

19
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,986
"Who's Ann?" "Don't ask me,
I'm just the boy's father."

20
00:01:10,089 --> 00:01:12,557
Hey, screw Sitwell!
He comes in here telling us...

21
00:01:12,658 --> 00:01:16,321
how to build our houses,
how to raise our kids.

22
00:01:16,428 --> 00:01:18,794
We know what we're doing.
We don't need any help from him.

23
00:01:18,897 --> 00:01:22,526
Damn it. This thing got pushed in again.

24
00:01:22,634 --> 00:01:24,795
<i>- Gonna need a butter knife.
- That's what I'm talking about.</i>

25
00:01:24,903 --> 00:01:27,303
George Michael's got these powerful
little fingers. He should be here.

26
00:01:27,406 --> 00:01:30,204
How do you think I feel?
He said he would help me on this essay...

27
00:01:30,309 --> 00:01:33,278
<i>- for The Old Man and the Sea.
- I'll help you with that later.</i>

28
00:01:33,378 --> 00:01:37,542
Oh, great. Okay. So you have to
read this, and then explain it...

29
00:01:37,649 --> 00:01:40,140
and, this is important,
say it in my own words, okay?

30
00:01:40,252 --> 00:01:43,050
Smart, but not too smart.
Let's have a four-syllable max.

31
00:01:43,155 --> 00:01:46,090
Do you wanna say something
or should I, Tobias?

32
00:01:46,191 --> 00:01:48,819
No. I believe in letting children learn
from their mistakes, Michael.

33
00:01:48,927 --> 00:01:53,125
They make a mistake once,
they shan't make it twice.

34
00:01:53,232 --> 00:01:55,598
Oh, here I go!

35
00:01:55,701 --> 00:02:00,263
<i>Don't worry. It has not fallen
into the garage. Knock on wood.</i>

36
00:02:02,441 --> 00:02:04,500
You gonna want to help me with that?

37
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:07,101
No, I can't.
I have an audition tomorrow.

38
00:02:07,212 --> 00:02:11,581
I'm up for a minor, but meaty, role
in a feature film.

39
00:02:11,683 --> 00:02:15,346
<i>- "Confidence Man Two."
- Oh, yeah? I didn't see the first Confidence Man.</i>

40
00:02:15,454 --> 00:02:18,048
No. Confidence Man Two
is my character.

41
00:02:18,157 --> 00:02:21,558
I think I'll drive up today
and plot my route to the studio.

42
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,890
How 'bout I come with you?
I could help you prepare.

43
00:02:23,996 --> 00:02:28,433
Yes, well, it's for a con man, which
I don't think you know anything about.

44
00:02:28,534 --> 00:02:31,128
And besides, don't you have school?

45
00:02:31,236 --> 00:02:36,139
No. Um- Today is
"Help Your Dad Follow His Dream" day.

46
00:02:36,241 --> 00:02:39,768
Great. We can take the carpool lane.

47
00:02:39,878 --> 00:02:42,870
- I need ice.
- I'm glad Sitwell's coming over.

48
00:02:42,981 --> 00:02:46,041
<i>Let him see that
we're doing fine as a family.</i>

49
00:02:46,151 --> 00:02:48,779
<i>The only help we need
is from each other.</i>

50
00:02:48,887 --> 00:02:51,515
- And apparently whatever's in that bottle.
- Thanks for reminding me.

51
00:02:51,623 --> 00:02:54,217
- My Teamocil.
- Wait a minute. Teamocil?

52
00:02:54,326 --> 00:02:57,818
Isn't that that supplement that you and Tobias
were hocking before the F.D.A. Shut you down?

53
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,058
<i>In the mid '90s,
Tobias formed a folk band...</i>

54
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:03,999
<i>to promote a supplement
that promised better unity and teamwork.</i>

55
00:03:04,102 --> 00:03:08,300
- Teamocil
- Teamocil may decrease your sex drive.

56
00:03:08,407 --> 00:03:11,069
- Teamocil
- Good job, buddy.
- Thanks, friend.

57
00:03:11,176 --> 00:03:14,703
Since I've been taking this again, I've been
getting along great with my husband.

58
00:03:14,813 --> 00:03:16,781
You're taking it for the side effect,
aren't you?

59
00:03:16,882 --> 00:03:18,349
<i>- Michael.
- Oh God.</i>

60
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,418
Mother, not a good time.
I'm having a meeting here.

61
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:23,317
- Look at what Buster sent from the army.
- It's blacked out.

62
00:03:23,422 --> 00:03:25,413
Oh, the government.
Keep reading.

63
00:03:25,524 --> 00:03:28,322
"Sergeant Blank is
treating me very blank...

64
00:03:28,427 --> 00:03:31,396
"and it looks like I'll be shipping off
to blank in about a blank.

65
00:03:31,496 --> 00:03:34,659
- I blank you, Mother. Buster."
- I've done everything I can.

66
00:03:34,766 --> 00:03:37,064
I even tried to convince them he's gay,
but no one would believe...

67
00:03:37,169 --> 00:03:39,194
that a woman like me
would have a gay son.

68
00:03:39,304 --> 00:03:42,102
Well, you certainly tried. You guys wore
matching outfits till he was 12.

69
00:03:42,207 --> 00:03:44,107
<i>Even once on a magazine cover...</i>

70
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:46,871
<i>that had been mocked
within the family for years.</i>

71
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:51,211
Lucille, l-I'll say it again. You never know
what's going to happen in the army.

72
00:03:51,316 --> 00:03:55,878
- Remember, Lucille?
- No, I don't.

73
00:03:55,988 --> 00:03:58,957
- Get me a vodka, rocks.
- Mom, it's breakfast.

74
00:03:59,057 --> 00:04:01,855
- And a piece of toast.
- Please, Stan Sitwell's coming over.

75
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,726
<i>That hairless freak is coming here?
None ofhis hair is real, you know.</i>

76
00:04:05,831 --> 00:04:09,858
You mean the guy we're meeting with
can't even grow his own hair? Come on!

77
00:04:09,968 --> 00:04:13,597
It's called alopecia, and I'd appreciate it
if we could all be sensitive to it, okay?

78
00:04:13,705 --> 00:04:17,300
<i>He happens to be
a very modest and generous man.
- Modest and generous?</i>

79
00:04:17,409 --> 00:04:20,378
Then why is he always waving giant
$10 million checks over his head...

80
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:23,937
- every time some-
- Go ahead, Mom. Finish your thought.

81
00:04:24,049 --> 00:04:27,075
"Every time some children's
hospital needs funding"?

82
00:04:27,185 --> 00:04:30,643
Nonetheless, we could get
a giant checkbook too.

83
00:04:30,756 --> 00:04:33,156
We're just not
that starved for attention.

84
00:04:34,926 --> 00:04:37,224
<i>And later, Sitwell
laid out his plans.</i>

85
00:04:37,329 --> 00:04:40,162
- Sorry that my son couldn't be here-
- Let me guess. Girlfriend.

86
00:04:40,265 --> 00:04:45,066
You know, it could be worse. He could
wanna marry your mother.

87
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:47,604
Oh, I'm sorry. Is your family not
laughing at that yet?

88
00:04:47,706 --> 00:04:49,333
Okay. Let me tell you
what I'm offering.

89
00:04:49,441 --> 00:04:51,739
You got a wonderful piece of property
here that's going nowhere.

90
00:04:51,843 --> 00:04:54,641
So what I propose is a co-venture
with your Sudden Valley Development.

91
00:04:54,746 --> 00:04:57,374
The first thing you might
wanna change though is the name.

92
00:04:57,482 --> 00:05:00,451
You know, Sudden Valley conjures up
the image of a sinkhole, no?

93
00:05:00,552 --> 00:05:03,350
I told that to Dad.
I told that to my dad.

94
00:05:03,455 --> 00:05:06,549
<i>I'm thinking- Paradise Gardens.</i>

95
00:05:06,658 --> 00:05:10,287
I swear to God, I have that written-

96
00:05:10,395 --> 00:05:13,387
I want you to see so you don't think-
I have that written down in my notebook.

97
00:05:13,498 --> 00:05:15,466
<i>When George Sr. Was in charge...</i>

98
00:05:15,567 --> 00:05:19,025
<i>he had a habit of shooting down
any idea Michael came up with.</i>

99
00:05:19,137 --> 00:05:23,767
And Sudden Valley just sort of implies that
something awful could happen all of a sudden.

100
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:27,367
- Plus, it's on a hill.
- What are you taking, stupid pills? Come on.

101
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:29,447
Save us some money.

102
00:05:29,548 --> 00:05:32,381
<i>This was a management tool
that he used to keep Michael...</i>

103
00:05:32,484 --> 00:05:36,045
<i>- working for his approval.
- That was a hard one to say no to.</i>

104
00:05:36,154 --> 00:05:38,782
The only thing I ask is
out of the 450 homes we build...

105
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:41,381
one be given to a disadvantaged family
from the inner city.

106
00:05:41,493 --> 00:05:45,429
<i>That's great. So the other
449 families live in fear?</i>

107
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:48,727
Is that what we're saying?
I mean, come on! Where's your decen-

108
00:05:48,834 --> 00:05:51,132
What the hell just fell off your face?

109
00:05:51,236 --> 00:05:54,228
- One of this guy's eyebrows fell in the candy beans.
- I always carry a spare.

110
00:05:54,339 --> 00:05:57,399
<i>Well, I hope you also carry a spare bowl
of candy beans.</i>

111
00:05:57,509 --> 00:05:59,500
Gob! I'm very impressed
with the offer.

112
00:05:59,611 --> 00:06:02,273
I'm gonna run it upstairs,
see what kind of reaction it gets.

113
00:06:02,381 --> 00:06:05,179
- Hmm?
- So to speak.

114
00:06:05,283 --> 00:06:08,775
<i>- Michael hoped to impress his father.
- I think it sounds pretty good.</i>

115
00:06:08,887 --> 00:06:11,879
Pretty good? It was horrible.
What are you taking, stupid pills again?

116
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:15,084
<i>But their old dynamic
returned when George Sr. Did.</i>

117
00:06:15,193 --> 00:06:18,822
Gob was the only one down there
who knew how to handle that hairless freak.

118
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,057
- Thank God we have Gob on our team.
- You know, Dad...

119
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:23,964
Gob doesn't really do
all that much for our team.

120
00:06:24,069 --> 00:06:26,663
In fact, I think it's time
that I get put back in charge.

121
00:06:26,772 --> 00:06:29,172
Michael, listen to me.
Lately, your ideas, they're horrible.

122
00:06:29,274 --> 00:06:32,766
<i>And Sitwell's just trying to
figure out our batting order...</i>

123
00:06:32,878 --> 00:06:35,369
for the softball game
on Saturday, I'm telling you.

124
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,971
Gob said the same thing, Dad,
but l-I doubt that this guy's...

125
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:41,644
trying to drop $15 million
to find out our batting order.

126
00:06:41,753 --> 00:06:43,618
Hey. This game goes way, way back.

127
00:06:43,722 --> 00:06:46,850
<i>It was a fierce rivalry, with George Sr. Using...</i>

128
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:51,190
<i>- everything at his disposal to win-
- No hair. Hey, we got no hair.</i>

129
00:06:51,296 --> 00:06:55,960
<i>While Stan Sitwell used the game
to raise funds for underprivileged children.</i>

130
00:06:56,067 --> 00:07:00,128
- Oh, I think one of your orphans
is heading towards the street.
- Strike three.

131
00:07:00,238 --> 00:07:03,036
You go down there, and you tell him
to go screw himself...

132
00:07:03,141 --> 00:07:04,540
and apologize to your brother.

133
00:07:04,643 --> 00:07:07,077
We need him on our side,
and we need him happy.

134
00:07:07,212 --> 00:07:09,510
- Where's Sitwell?
- Sorry. I told him to screw off.

135
00:07:09,614 --> 00:07:12,583
- But get this, he offered me a job.
- What?

136
00:07:12,684 --> 00:07:15,653
Well, I'm not waiting
on my brother. I pass.

137
00:07:15,754 --> 00:07:19,246
- You look surprised.
- I'm sorry. I must've put it on too high.

138
00:07:19,357 --> 00:07:22,986
But you were right. It was a bad offer
and you were smart enough not to take it.

139
00:07:23,094 --> 00:07:26,393
You got gumption. You speak your mind. That
means you're good enough to work for me.

140
00:07:26,498 --> 00:07:28,159
you.

141
00:07:28,266 --> 00:07:30,894
And I accepted.
He's waiting for me outside.

142
00:07:31,002 --> 00:07:35,234
We're gonna swing by his wigmaker.
His "just woke up" hair is finally ready.

143
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,604
You're really gonna do this?

144
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:42,009
It's ready, Mike. They're only
gonna hold it for 24 hours.

145
00:07:42,113 --> 00:07:46,072
<i>Tobias and Maeby, meanwhile,
had mapped the route to the audition.</i>

146
00:07:46,184 --> 00:07:49,642
Well, here we are
and home we go...

147
00:07:49,754 --> 00:07:53,087
with plenty of time
to get you to English class.

148
00:07:53,191 --> 00:07:55,250
Wait. You can't do
a U-turn on your dream.

149
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,160
I say, we get you on the lot and get
the Fünke name out there.

150
00:07:59,264 --> 00:08:02,722
- Start talking you up around the watercoolers.
- Maeby, we'll never get on here.

151
00:08:02,834 --> 00:08:06,361
I mean, behind these walls
are the biggest stars in the world.

152
00:08:06,471 --> 00:08:09,099
<i>America's treasures.</i>

153
00:08:11,576 --> 00:08:15,535
- Damn it!
- Dad, you're auditioning for the part
of a confidence man.

154
00:08:15,647 --> 00:08:17,376
Let's try a little confidence.

155
00:08:17,482 --> 00:08:20,076
You say confidence man?
Hey, I'm up for that part too.

156
00:08:20,185 --> 00:08:22,483
- Oh.
- Good luck to you.

157
00:08:22,587 --> 00:08:24,384
Good luck to you too.

158
00:08:24,489 --> 00:08:26,889
<i>As Tobias was gaining
self-confidence...</i>

159
00:08:26,992 --> 00:08:28,926
<i>- Michael was struggling to keep his.
- Hi, Dad.</i>

160
00:08:29,027 --> 00:08:31,723
- Wow, you're president again?
- Yes, this is the way it should be.

161
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:34,492
What do you think of when you hear
the words, "Sudden Valley"?

162
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:38,501
Salad dressing, I think. But for
some reason, I don't wanna eat it.

163
00:08:38,603 --> 00:08:43,506
- Right. But "Paradise Gardens."
- Yeah. Okay. I can see marinating a chicken in that.

164
00:08:43,608 --> 00:08:46,975
Um, I'm actually here about the softball game.
We need some girls on the team, right?

165
00:08:47,078 --> 00:08:48,909
Yes, we do.
That's a league requirement.

166
00:08:49,014 --> 00:08:51,915
<i>One that was difficult to meet,
given Gob's behavior...</i>

167
00:08:52,017 --> 00:08:54,349
<i>in the third inning
oflast year's game.</i>

168
00:08:54,452 --> 00:08:56,283
We could stay here,
wait for another pop-up.

169
00:08:56,388 --> 00:08:59,653
<i>- And in the fifth inning.
- Come on! Yeah, here we go!</i>

170
00:08:59,758 --> 00:09:02,090
<i>Oh, and before the game.</i>

171
00:09:04,796 --> 00:09:07,765
We lost our entire outfield
and a couple of court cases.

172
00:09:07,866 --> 00:09:11,267
Well, you know who would be great
and not at all litigious is Ann.

173
00:09:11,369 --> 00:09:13,929
- Mmm, not Ann.
- No?

174
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:17,839
'Cause you know this-this
game is kind of our thing.

175
00:09:17,943 --> 00:09:20,207
But Ann's amazing.
You know, she could play my position.

176
00:09:20,312 --> 00:09:24,180
You should be playing the field...
there, in right, you know?

177
00:09:24,282 --> 00:09:27,547
Plus, I got Aunt Lindsay playing this year.
I can't very well pull her off the roster.

178
00:09:27,652 --> 00:09:32,146
Let's make Ann the backup, okay? Very good
way to think about her... as a backup.

179
00:09:32,257 --> 00:09:34,054
- She's gonna be so excited.
- Good.

180
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:37,959
- Maybe-Maybe now I'll get a kiss.
- Okay.

181
00:09:38,063 --> 00:09:42,227
Oh. I meant from Ann.

182
00:09:43,535 --> 00:09:46,470
Yes, I know.
I just want to get in there first.

183
00:09:46,571 --> 00:09:49,369
Okay.

184
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:54,408
Lindsay, wake up. I need you
to play on the softball team this year.

185
00:09:54,512 --> 00:09:57,640
<i>Lindsay felt the intended effect of Teamocil-</i>

186
00:09:57,749 --> 00:10:01,378
<i>- a sense of camaraderie.
- Count me in, Michael. Happy to help the team.</i>

187
00:10:04,856 --> 00:10:07,484
- Great news. I'm back.
- You just left.

188
00:10:07,592 --> 00:10:09,719
Yeah, I don't think
things are gonna work out with Sitwell.

189
00:10:09,828 --> 00:10:12,797
<i>I mean, we picked up his sleepy-head wig,
everything was cool.</i>

190
00:10:12,897 --> 00:10:15,422
Next thing I know, he's asking me
for a bunch of work ideas.

191
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:19,594
So, I thought I'd just quit
and go back to being president here.

192
00:10:19,704 --> 00:10:23,265
<i>I need to do this job, okay?
I need to prove that I can do this job.</i>

193
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:28,005
- To who?
- To... you.

194
00:10:28,113 --> 00:10:32,174
Michael, I'm your big brother.
I'll never be impressed with you.

195
00:10:32,283 --> 00:10:34,251
- Still.
- Anyway, look. You can still do it.

196
00:10:34,352 --> 00:10:38,914
I just want the office
and my stuffs and title.

197
00:10:39,024 --> 00:10:44,189
What about... if I help you with
your work over at Sitwell?

198
00:10:44,295 --> 00:10:46,855
- You'd do that?
- Sure.

199
00:10:46,965 --> 00:10:49,399
You really want me
to succeed at Sitwell.

200
00:10:49,501 --> 00:10:55,133
Well, I just- Hey. Come on. I really want
you to be over at Sitwell.

201
00:10:58,239 --> 00:11:03,472
<i>Lucille was worried that her son
Buster was being sent into battle with the army.</i>

202
00:11:03,578 --> 00:11:06,706
I feel that we've not brought
something up that might be a solution...

203
00:11:06,814 --> 00:11:09,374
um, to spare my feelings.

204
00:11:09,484 --> 00:11:12,942
Send you in his place? I called.
They don't want you back.

205
00:11:13,054 --> 00:11:17,684
<i>Oscar had served in Vietnam
as a croc spotter on a Swift boat.</i>

206
00:11:17,792 --> 00:11:20,022
Croc! No, Sorry. Wait. Log.

207
00:11:20,128 --> 00:11:22,096
Just a log.
No, wait. Sorry. Croc!

208
00:11:22,197 --> 00:11:26,497
<i>It was there that he met
a young U.S.O. Dancer named Lucille.</i>

209
00:11:26,601 --> 00:11:28,466
<i>I prefer an older man.</i>

210
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:33,166
<i>- Hey, I'm free after the show.
- I said older, Bob, not dead.</i>

211
00:11:35,009 --> 00:11:38,137
I swore I'd never
say his name again, but...

212
00:11:38,246 --> 00:11:40,908
it's time to call you-know-who.

213
00:11:41,015 --> 00:11:45,145
<i>"You-know-who"was
an army sergeant named Bill Anderson.</i>

214
00:11:45,253 --> 00:11:49,986
<i>He and Lucille were an item
before she left him for Oscar.</i>

215
00:11:50,091 --> 00:11:54,892
<i>At the studio, Tobias began to
create buzz around the watercooler.</i>

216
00:11:54,996 --> 00:11:56,987
That Fünke is some kind of something.

217
00:11:57,098 --> 00:11:59,362
Boy, this Fünke is all anybody's
ever talking about.

218
00:11:59,467 --> 00:12:02,800
So sick and tired of hearing about
how brilliant that Fünke is.

219
00:12:02,904 --> 00:12:06,965
Overrated.
I'll just move- I'm sorry.

220
00:12:07,075 --> 00:12:09,600
Okay. We're okay. Okay.

221
00:12:09,711 --> 00:12:13,340
<i>Meanwhile, Maeby looked for
an empty office to call George Michael.</i>

222
00:12:13,448 --> 00:12:17,544
Where are you? I bought you a day.
I can't put this book report off forever.

223
00:12:17,652 --> 00:12:19,847
<i>Sorry, is this your office?</i>

224
00:12:19,954 --> 00:12:23,481
No. I'm just sitting behind someone else's
desk pretending these are my kids.

225
00:12:23,591 --> 00:12:26,617
<i>Can you getJude Law
in here for a meeting?</i>

226
00:12:26,728 --> 00:12:28,787
- Oh, I'm just a reader.
- A reader?

227
00:12:28,896 --> 00:12:32,525
- Yeah.
- I need a report by tomorrow.

228
00:12:32,634 --> 00:12:37,264
<i>Before gym-lunch...
with Jim... Carrey.</i>

229
00:12:37,372 --> 00:12:39,636
<i>It's the Grinch guy.
You're too young.</i>

230
00:12:43,578 --> 00:12:47,378
So get this.
Sitwell loved my ideas.

231
00:12:47,482 --> 00:12:50,451
Well, my ideas and I knew it.
That's great.

232
00:12:50,551 --> 00:12:53,349
- You know, Dad never complimented any of those.
- Here's the thing.

233
00:12:53,454 --> 00:12:57,322
<i>- I need more.
- There were 34 proposals in there.</i>

234
00:12:57,425 --> 00:13:00,155
You'd be amazed how fast they come out
when you read them all in a row.

235
00:13:00,261 --> 00:13:04,391
"Thirty-one, bamboo floor upgrades.
Cheaper, stronger." I can't read this word.

236
00:13:04,499 --> 00:13:07,434
"Thirty-two, wireless 'crapability."'
That one explains itself.

237
00:13:07,535 --> 00:13:09,833
- "Thirty-three"-
- Gob, that was six-months' worth of work.

238
00:13:09,937 --> 00:13:11,905
<i>- You can't just blurt them all out at once.
- Mr. Bluth.</i>

239
00:13:12,006 --> 00:13:15,237
- He's coming. I've got to go.
- You blew them away.

240
00:13:15,343 --> 00:13:19,143
Bought you something. Maybe
we can play catch sometime.

241
00:13:19,247 --> 00:13:22,546
<i>Gob's own father had only
once played catch with him.</i>

242
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:26,746
<i>And it ended as badly
as any game of catch could end.</i>

243
00:13:26,854 --> 00:13:29,982
- White power!
- Better yet, maybe we can play ball on Saturday.

244
00:13:30,091 --> 00:13:33,060
I'll meet you there.
I've got a neck hair fitting at 11:00.

245
00:13:33,161 --> 00:13:38,121
<i>Gob was both angry...
and overwhelmed...</i>

246
00:13:38,232 --> 00:13:41,360
<i>by the approval
from this new father figure.</i>

247
00:13:41,469 --> 00:13:44,529
<i>It was confusing.</i>

248
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,540
<i>Michael was less torn
and went to brag to his father.</i>

249
00:13:47,642 --> 00:13:52,375
So, apparently my ideas aren't so bad,
and that comes from Sitwell himself.

250
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,211
- You let your ideas go to Sitwell?
- Uh, no. I gave them to Gob...

251
00:13:56,317 --> 00:14:00,048
who, uh, works there now.

252
00:14:00,154 --> 00:14:02,122
You let Gob go to Sitwell?

253
00:14:02,223 --> 00:14:04,521
- What'd I tell you? I told you-
- "Don't let him go." I know.

254
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:07,560
- But my point is that I do all the work, Pop.
- He makes all the plays.

255
00:14:07,662 --> 00:14:09,994
Don't you understand? He was the best
softball player in the league.

256
00:14:10,098 --> 00:14:15,229
<i>Gob was especially gifted
at sacrificing his body for the play.</i>

257
00:14:15,336 --> 00:14:18,464
<i>- Play's at second. Play's at second.
- Yeah! Suck on that, Sitwell.</i>

258
00:14:18,573 --> 00:14:21,064
<i>Although at times,
even that wasn't enough.</i>

259
00:14:21,175 --> 00:14:24,008
Your Tweety Bird dance
just cost us a run, you moron.

260
00:14:24,112 --> 00:14:26,342
<i>Why do you think
Sitwell hired him?</i>

261
00:14:26,447 --> 00:14:29,814
You can't do this. You're gonna lose the game,
the company, and you can't do this.

262
00:14:29,917 --> 00:14:32,909
What are you saying? If I win the game,
you're comfortable with me running the company?

263
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,147
- That's what I'm saying.
- I'll win the game.

264
00:14:35,289 --> 00:14:38,520
And I'll show him that
his little plan didn't work, all right?

265
00:14:38,626 --> 00:14:42,255
- We can build houses. We can win games.
- That is what I wanna hear.

266
00:14:42,363 --> 00:14:46,424
We can win games.

267
00:14:48,035 --> 00:14:51,937
Lindsay, did that oven vent hit you?
Your foot is bleeding.

268
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:55,634
<i>My foot is bleeding.
- Teamocil may cause
numbness of the extremities.</i>

269
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,711
You're gonna be able
to play on our team, right?

270
00:14:57,812 --> 00:15:01,111
- Why do you think I'm taking Teamocil?
- To curb your sex drive.

271
00:15:01,215 --> 00:15:03,115
That's right. What team
are you talking about?

272
00:15:03,217 --> 00:15:06,812
<i>It may also cause
short-term memory loss.</i>

273
00:15:06,921 --> 00:15:09,617
<i>Okay. Looks like I'm gonna need
that female backup player after all.</i>

274
00:15:09,724 --> 00:15:12,659
<i>- And Ann's really good at softball, huh?
- Yeah. She's amazing.</i>

275
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,354
You know, she's got this low center
of gravity. You can't knock her over.

276
00:15:15,463 --> 00:15:18,193
<i>- Well, I could knock her over.
- Dad, I'm telling you, you can't.</i>

277
00:15:18,299 --> 00:15:20,529
<i>They call her "The Wall,"
you know?</i>

278
00:15:20,635 --> 00:15:24,799
Well, that's great. But I could
knock her over. I won't, but I could.

279
00:15:24,906 --> 00:15:27,534
<i>- And Lucille called on an old lover.
- William?</i>

280
00:15:27,642 --> 00:15:30,076
- Yes, ma'am?
- You don't remember me?

281
00:15:30,178 --> 00:15:34,308
<i>General Anderson had done
three tours of duty in Vietnam...</i>

282
00:15:34,415 --> 00:15:39,375
<i>- but the only memory he'd blocked
was being left by Lucille.
- Oh, God. That touch.</i>

283
00:15:39,487 --> 00:15:43,355
- Oh, how could I forget? Pat?
- Lucille.

284
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:46,325
I could never forget that touch.

285
00:15:46,427 --> 00:15:50,158
Bill, they're shipping my son Buster off.
I can't have that happen.

286
00:15:50,264 --> 00:15:54,564
- I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do.
- Is there anything I can do?

287
00:15:55,870 --> 00:16:00,933
Maybe if you... go downtown.

288
00:16:01,042 --> 00:16:04,910
Oh, I haven't done that in 30 years.

289
00:16:15,389 --> 00:16:18,119
You make me want to puke, Bluth!

290
00:16:18,226 --> 00:16:21,024
<i>And so, Buster was pulled out
of combat training-</i>

291
00:16:21,128 --> 00:16:25,690
<i>- Put 'em down and halt!
- and put into U.S.O. Training.</i>

292
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:33,029
<i>- It jolts, but it's not really doing it right now.
- And back at Gob's new office.</i>

293
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,937
- Michael.
- Do you still need those ideas?

294
00:16:35,042 --> 00:16:37,875
<i>Come on. Are you kidding me?
I can't let Sitwell down.</i>

295
00:16:37,979 --> 00:16:41,540
- L-I'm desperate here.
- Then I'll make you a deal.

296
00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:45,642
- I want you to throw the softball game.
- Never!

297
00:16:45,753 --> 00:16:48,415
- He gave me this.
- Course he did. Why do you think he hired you?

298
00:16:48,523 --> 00:16:51,390
He liked my ideas.

299
00:16:51,492 --> 00:16:53,392
They were my ideas,
and, no, he didn't.

300
00:16:53,494 --> 00:16:57,225
He wants you for the softball game because
he's trying to make our family look foolish.

301
00:16:57,331 --> 00:17:02,166
<i>I knew you had bad ideas.
All right, we'll play him.</i>

302
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:04,898
I'll throw that softball game.

303
00:17:05,006 --> 00:17:08,237
Nobody makes a fool of
our family without my help.

304
00:17:13,613 --> 00:17:17,845
<i>Tobias had talked up the name
Fünke, and it was time to audition.</i>

305
00:17:17,951 --> 00:17:20,681
- What's your name?
- Tobias.

306
00:17:20,787 --> 00:17:22,812
He's too short. Give it to the guard.

307
00:17:22,923 --> 00:17:28,259
Oh. L- I'm not. L-
On camera, I seem much taller.

308
00:17:28,361 --> 00:17:31,660
<i>And Maeby picked up the reader's report,
which had now become her book report.</i>

309
00:17:31,765 --> 00:17:34,461
- Whatcha got there?
- I can't really discuss it.

310
00:17:34,568 --> 00:17:36,968
If you wanna get it made,
I'm the guy who has to see it.

311
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:40,699
You're the Fünke everyone's talking about?
What are you, like, 15?

312
00:17:40,807 --> 00:17:44,675
- Marry me.
- Everyone thinks I look young too.

313
00:17:44,778 --> 00:17:47,770
- So who are you thinking about?
- Jude Law. Why do you ask?

314
00:17:47,881 --> 00:17:50,349
<i>Yeah. Go young. Young Guy and the Sea.
Big spring-breaker.</i>

315
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:53,442
Four C.G.I. The fish.
Let's fast-track this one.

316
00:17:53,553 --> 00:17:56,954
<i>And that's when Maeby realized
she had become a successful film executive.</i>

317
00:17:57,057 --> 00:17:59,218
- It's all waxed up.
- All waxed up? What do you mean?

318
00:17:59,326 --> 00:18:02,318
- I need something. Ajob for my dad.
- Yeah, yeah. Sure. Okay.

319
00:18:02,429 --> 00:18:05,796
Listen to me.
Brand new cars don't get waxed!

320
00:18:05,899 --> 00:18:08,367
<i>That afternoon it was game time...</i>

321
00:18:08,468 --> 00:18:10,959
<i>and Michael felt confident
about a Bluth win.</i>

322
00:18:13,473 --> 00:18:15,703
Spin, spin, spin.

323
00:18:15,809 --> 00:18:20,542
<i>Ann wasn't as amazing as
George Michael led his father to believe.</i>

324
00:18:21,615 --> 00:18:23,810
<i>But Gob was playing
worse than ever...</i>

325
00:18:23,917 --> 00:18:26,818
<i>as per his agreement with Michael.</i>

326
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,593
<i>Your guy can't hit, Sitwell.
He's never gonna touch it.</i>

327
00:18:37,697 --> 00:18:39,756
- Time out.
- Time out.

328
00:18:39,866 --> 00:18:41,993
Gob, are you okay?

329
00:18:42,102 --> 00:18:44,900
Yeah, just can't hit today.
Guess you're really disappointed in me.

330
00:18:45,005 --> 00:18:48,168
Hey. Everybody has days like this.
It's only a game.

331
00:18:48,274 --> 00:18:51,334
After that list of ideas you gave me,
I don't care if you blow the whole season.

332
00:18:51,444 --> 00:18:54,174
Come here, you.

333
00:18:55,582 --> 00:18:57,345
Okay. We're good.

334
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:01,409
<i>And Gob finally felt
that someone believed in him.</i>

335
00:19:01,521 --> 00:19:05,184
<i>Even though they weren't his ideas.</i>

336
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:07,919
<i>And he decided
to make Sitwell proud.</i>

337
00:19:11,064 --> 00:19:13,191
<i>Get on that ball!</i>

338
00:19:15,535 --> 00:19:18,026
You go!

339
00:19:18,138 --> 00:19:20,038
You better pull an ankle or something.

340
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,040
<i>Come on, George Michael!
Get that ball in there!</i>

341
00:19:22,142 --> 00:19:24,201
<i>Then he went headfirst into The Wall.</i>

342
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,278
- I'm safe.
- You're out!

343
00:19:26,379 --> 00:19:29,712
<i>Out? I was safe! I'm safe!</i>

344
00:19:29,816 --> 00:19:32,876
- Stop with the Tweety Bird dance, you moron.
- Dad?

345
00:19:32,986 --> 00:19:35,318
He made the call. You're out.
What are you doing?

346
00:19:35,422 --> 00:19:37,219
- Shush, shush, shush.
- Dad?

347
00:19:37,323 --> 00:19:39,723
- He's safe.
- What the hell are you doing here?

348
00:19:39,826 --> 00:19:42,920
I'm taking care of what you
screwed up. You blew it again, Michael.

349
00:19:43,029 --> 00:19:47,398
Let me tell you something. I blew it when
I let you start controlling me again.

350
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,400
I even stooped to cheat here
at a softball game.

351
00:19:49,502 --> 00:19:51,902
You've been talking to each other.
How come nobody called me?

352
00:19:52,005 --> 00:19:55,304
- What's going on there?
- I'm just fixing something that's been bugging me.

353
00:19:55,408 --> 00:19:58,002
<i>He was safe.</i>

354
00:19:58,111 --> 00:20:01,740
He was. We lost.
Get over it.

355
00:20:01,848 --> 00:20:05,340
Yeah, and Stan Sitwell liked my ideas.
He really believed in me.

356
00:20:05,452 --> 00:20:07,249
- My ideas.
- Well.

357
00:20:07,353 --> 00:20:10,254
And I'm president, whether
you like it or not, Dad.

358
00:20:10,356 --> 00:20:12,483
I don't need your approval anymore.

359
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:17,359
- I'm proud of you.
- Really?

360
00:20:17,464 --> 00:20:19,557
Yeah. See ya.

361
00:20:22,569 --> 00:20:25,094
Michael, I could've sworn
I just saw Dad.

362
00:20:25,205 --> 00:20:28,606
Or not. I think hallucination
is one of the side-effects ofTeamocil.

363
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:30,835
<i>It isn't.</i>

364
00:20:30,944 --> 00:20:33,242
- Thanks for making the right call there, Mike.
- Yeah.

365
00:20:33,346 --> 00:20:36,474
- Sorry I didn't blow the game.
- No. You did the right thing...

366
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:39,143
and you finally got Dad
to one of your ball games.

367
00:20:39,252 --> 00:20:41,880
- Screw him.
- Yeah.

368
00:20:41,988 --> 00:20:45,651
I miss him so much.

369
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:48,523
<i>On the next
Arrested Development.</i>

370
00:20:48,628 --> 00:20:51,825
<i>- Maeby gets her father a job.
- I gotta fire one of ya.</i>

371
00:20:51,931 --> 00:20:54,627
<i>Andy Richter! Here are those head shots
I was telling you about.</i>

372
00:20:54,734 --> 00:20:58,192
- Yeah. I gotta go.
- It's Tobias Fünke. I told you about the head shots?

373
00:20:58,304 --> 00:21:00,795
<i>And Buster visits the general.</i>

374
00:21:00,907 --> 00:21:03,307
I just wanted to thank you for my new job.

375
00:21:03,409 --> 00:21:06,970
- What's wrong?
- I'm shipping out tomorrow.

376
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:12,814
- I've got just the thing.
- Oh. I haven't felt hands like that in years.

377
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:15,854
You are coming to the front.
