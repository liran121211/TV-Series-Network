1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:04,421
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:04,523 --> 00:00:06,514
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:06,625 --> 00:00:08,616
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:14,166 --> 00:00:15,861
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

5
00:00:18,037 --> 00:00:20,528
<i>George Michael
was getting ready for school...</i>

6
00:00:20,639 --> 00:00:23,699
<i>when he came across a box
oflove letters he'd written...</i>

7
00:00:23,809 --> 00:00:27,370
<i>but never sent
to his cousin Maeby.</i>

8
00:00:27,479 --> 00:00:30,209
<i>One letter titled "If You Weren't My Cousin,"</i>

9
00:00:30,315 --> 00:00:32,215
<i>was particularly incriminating.</i>

10
00:00:32,317 --> 00:00:34,285
Hey, pal, you want a ride to school?

11
00:00:34,386 --> 00:00:36,786
Um, no. Actually, I'm-

12
00:00:36,889 --> 00:00:39,050
I'm riding with the Veals, Ann's parents.

13
00:00:39,158 --> 00:00:42,685
You don't need to be penned up with them.
I'll drive you both. We'll take the stairs.

14
00:00:42,795 --> 00:00:45,491
<i>Right. Here's the thing though.
It's kind of cramped in there.</i>

15
00:00:45,597 --> 00:00:48,964
<i>Plus, a lot ofkids are still talking about when
you took down that homecoming banner.</i>

16
00:00:50,669 --> 00:00:53,137
Listen, are you embarrassed
to be seen in that car?

17
00:00:53,238 --> 00:00:55,399
It's not a car. But- But, no.

18
00:00:57,342 --> 00:00:59,936
I've got to get a new car.

19
00:01:00,045 --> 00:01:02,946
<i>George Michael decided
to hide the love letters in the attic...</i>

20
00:01:03,048 --> 00:01:04,948
<i>although Maeby
had her own problems.</i>

21
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:06,950
<i>After lying about her age...</i>

22
00:01:07,052 --> 00:01:10,886
<i>she had conned her way into a job
as a movie studio executive.</i>

23
00:01:10,989 --> 00:01:14,254
Did you get the stack of scripts that I sent you?
'Cause you certainly look well-rested.

24
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:17,419
- Marry me.
- Ha! I need your notes on those tomorrow.

25
00:01:17,529 --> 00:01:20,157
- Wanna have a drink?
- Yeah. Why don't we ask your wife
to come with us?

26
00:01:20,265 --> 00:01:22,426
Okay, then.
I'll see you tomorrow.

27
00:01:22,534 --> 00:01:25,298
<i>And downstairs, Buster paid a visit.</i>

28
00:01:25,404 --> 00:01:28,669
- Hey, Brother. I need a favor.
- Of course you do.

29
00:01:28,774 --> 00:01:31,265
I'm on furlough this week, and
everybody's out dancing with their girl...

30
00:01:31,376 --> 00:01:34,277
- and I'm home sitting with Mom.
- Mom doesn't wanna go dancing?

31
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:37,280
I think the age difference
is really starting to catch up to us.

32
00:01:37,382 --> 00:01:39,942
Maybe it's time you got out there
and started meeting people, you know?

33
00:01:40,052 --> 00:01:43,351
Meetin' women. Meetin' women
who didn't give birth to you.

34
00:01:43,455 --> 00:01:47,949
- Maybe you could go with me.
- Not really what I meant-
I have a very busy schedule now.

35
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,724
<i>My schedule, however, is as open
as my relationship with my wife.</i>

36
00:01:52,831 --> 00:01:55,493
So why don't we pair up?

37
00:01:55,601 --> 00:01:57,466
<i>And-And hit the town together.</i>

38
00:01:57,569 --> 00:01:59,560
- Oh.
- I'll be your wingman.

39
00:01:59,671 --> 00:02:03,971
Even if it means
me taking a chubby, I will suck it up.

40
00:02:04,076 --> 00:02:06,271
Boy, that's enough
family stuff for today.

41
00:02:06,378 --> 00:02:09,404
<i>That's right, Michael.
Guess whojust got fired.</i>

42
00:02:09,515 --> 00:02:12,746
<i>Gob was recently hired
by the Bluth Company's rival...</i>

43
00:02:12,851 --> 00:02:14,751
<i>Sitwell Enterprises.</i>

44
00:02:14,853 --> 00:02:18,846
<i>- Although he started off well-
- Fifty-two percent of the country is single.</i>

45
00:02:18,957 --> 00:02:21,653
That's a market that's been
dominated by apartment rentals.

46
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,424
<i>Let's take some of that market.
I call it Single City.</i>

47
00:02:26,532 --> 00:02:28,659
<i>His ideas failed to evolve.</i>

48
00:02:28,767 --> 00:02:31,668
It's like, "Hey, you wanna
go down to the whirlpool?"

49
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,330
"Yeah. I don't have a husband."
I call it Swing City.

50
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:37,101
Let's get into some new
areas, if you don't mind.

51
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:40,508
<i>But Gob continued
to fine-tune his first one.</i>

52
00:02:40,612 --> 00:02:42,512
How do we filter out the teases?

53
00:02:42,614 --> 00:02:44,605
We don't let them in.

54
00:02:44,716 --> 00:02:46,616
This goes for the guys too...

55
00:02:46,718 --> 00:02:48,743
because sometimes the guys
are tapped out.

56
00:02:48,854 --> 00:02:53,450
But check your lease, man,
because you're livin' in- City.

57
00:02:53,559 --> 00:02:55,527
<i>- You're fired.
- So get this.</i>

58
00:02:55,627 --> 00:02:57,322
I took his dress eyebrows.

59
00:02:57,429 --> 00:03:00,694
<i>Sitwell suffered from a disease
that rendered him completely hairless.</i>

60
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:03,029
He's not gonna be happy about that.

61
00:03:03,135 --> 00:03:06,070
No, especially when he goes to the opera
with two mustaches on his forehead.

62
00:03:06,171 --> 00:03:09,197
Oh, but the good news is:
I'm coming back to the Bluth Company.

63
00:03:09,308 --> 00:03:12,869
Gob, we're gettin' all jammed up here, okay?

64
00:03:12,978 --> 00:03:15,572
The only reason that you were president
was to appease the board.

65
00:03:15,681 --> 00:03:17,581
They've been appeased.
I got the job.

66
00:03:17,683 --> 00:03:21,949
No, I don't need to be president.
I just liked having an office, a title.

67
00:03:22,054 --> 00:03:23,817
- Sure.
- Paycheck.

68
00:03:23,922 --> 00:03:27,380
Also I need a company car.
You do have to match Sitwell there.

69
00:03:27,492 --> 00:03:29,255
Hang on. He gave you
a company car?

70
00:03:29,361 --> 00:03:32,057
Yeah. And it was way better than any
of the company cars Dad ever gave me.

71
00:03:32,164 --> 00:03:34,632
- Yeah, right.
- I mean, the Camaro was okay.

72
00:03:36,501 --> 00:03:39,231
Are you serious?
Dad gave you the Camaro?

73
00:03:39,338 --> 00:03:42,273
<i>I thought you won that
on Card Sharks.</i>

74
00:03:42,374 --> 00:03:46,970
<i>Michael, I was never on Card Sharks.
Dad told us not to tell you.</i>

75
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:49,513
<i>Michael decided to confront his father...</i>

76
00:03:49,615 --> 00:03:52,607
<i>who'd been living in the attic
since he'd escaped from prison.</i>

77
00:03:52,718 --> 00:03:55,278
- Dad?
- Oh, thank God you're here.

78
00:03:55,387 --> 00:03:57,855
I'm going crazy
with the boredom, Michael.

79
00:03:57,956 --> 00:04:01,016
At least in prison, we had knife fights,
and we had movie night.

80
00:04:01,126 --> 00:04:05,790
<i>And once both. Those men did not enjoy Soapdish.
I think you have to know that world.</i>

81
00:04:05,897 --> 00:04:09,833
Yeah, listen, did you buy a company car
for everyone in the family except me?

82
00:04:09,935 --> 00:04:12,096
Well, according to the books,
I gave you four.

83
00:04:12,204 --> 00:04:14,866
I'm serious. I'm driving
a staircase, for God's sake.

84
00:04:14,973 --> 00:04:16,964
It smells like gas.
I get hop-ons.

85
00:04:17,075 --> 00:04:20,010
- Well, of course you're gonna get hop-ons.
- I pull down banners, all right?

86
00:04:20,112 --> 00:04:23,309
And most importantly, Dad,
my son does not like to be seen in it.

87
00:04:23,415 --> 00:04:25,645
But he likes being seen with that girl.

88
00:04:25,751 --> 00:04:28,117
- It makes no sense, I know.
- It doesn't.

89
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,620
I never gave you a-a company car.

90
00:04:30,722 --> 00:04:33,156
No, I gave you something
far more important.

91
00:04:33,258 --> 00:04:35,988
I gave you company, which, apparently,
you don't want to give to me.

92
00:04:36,094 --> 00:04:39,257
- You're not listening to me.
I'd love to sit and chat, but...
- I'm lonely up here.

93
00:04:39,364 --> 00:04:42,265
I've got to get an early start.
I'm expecting headwinds on the stair car.

94
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:46,235
You see anybody here? You could bring me
a book. Pop-Pop gets a Grisham?

95
00:04:46,338 --> 00:04:49,398
So you take your mom to work
every day? Bummer.

96
00:04:49,508 --> 00:04:53,035
Moms are such a pain in the ass, huh?
It's like "Die already!"

97
00:04:53,145 --> 00:04:55,511
- I love my mother.
- Huh?

98
00:04:55,614 --> 00:04:58,310
She's one of the two most
important people in my life.

99
00:04:58,417 --> 00:05:00,317
You know, she and Quincy.

100
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:03,650
<i>A spokesman
for Mr. Jones denies they've ever met...</i>

101
00:05:03,755 --> 00:05:08,715
<i>although he could not explain the six
signed gold records in Starla's apartment.</i>

102
00:05:08,827 --> 00:05:11,853
I could never be with a man
who doesn't love his mother.

103
00:05:11,963 --> 00:05:13,828
- Oh.
- Wow.

104
00:05:13,932 --> 00:05:17,698
So, Michael, listen. I'm here
to convince you to hire me back.

105
00:05:17,803 --> 00:05:21,398
I'm an ideas man, Michael. I think
I proved that with- Mountain.

106
00:05:21,506 --> 00:05:23,406
Listen, I want this, Michael.

107
00:05:23,508 --> 00:05:25,703
I'm gonna prove to you that
I'm worthy of rehiring...

108
00:05:25,811 --> 00:05:28,780
if it takes every ounce of
determination that I've got.

109
00:05:30,282 --> 00:05:32,182
Where are you going?

110
00:05:32,284 --> 00:05:34,844
Did you want me
to stay and do that?

111
00:05:38,023 --> 00:05:41,186
- Barry.
- Good news and even better news.

112
00:05:41,293 --> 00:05:43,193
Your company's stock is unfrozen...

113
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,195
and my lawsuit against
the L.A. Kings is moving forward.

114
00:05:45,297 --> 00:05:48,198
- How did that happen?
- Maybe a puck hit me. It could happen.

115
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:53,294
No, the stock. Now, that means we can sell,
right? We can do whatever we want with it?

116
00:05:53,405 --> 00:05:56,374
I'll tell you one thing you don't want to do
is buy stock in the L.A. Kings.

117
00:05:56,475 --> 00:05:58,602
Do you think I could sell
enough to buy a car?

118
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:01,577
I thought you had four.
Oh, you mean a real one. Yeah, sure.

119
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,410
You can get one, as long as everyone
doesn't sell the company stock at once.

120
00:06:04,516 --> 00:06:07,383
<i>You don't want someone else
to get control of the company.</i>

121
00:06:07,486 --> 00:06:11,047
Right. Gotta keep the company intact, right?
The other people shouldn't risk selling their-

122
00:06:11,156 --> 00:06:13,989
Maybe you can draft up
a letter to the investors:

123
00:06:14,092 --> 00:06:16,925
<i>"Yes, the stock is unfrozen.
We urge you not to sell."</i>

124
00:06:17,028 --> 00:06:20,555
Uh, yeah. Wh-What you just said was
perfect. Why do you want me to write it?

125
00:06:20,665 --> 00:06:24,601
Just send it out on your stationery.
And do it quickly. I have a car to buy.

126
00:06:24,703 --> 00:06:28,935
<i>Meanwhile, Maeby snuck
upstairs to secretly read her scripts.</i>

127
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,500
Ow! Back to film school-

128
00:06:35,046 --> 00:06:38,573
<i>And George Sr. Was only too happy
to have something to read.</i>

129
00:06:38,683 --> 00:06:41,311
<i>Armageddon."</i>

130
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:44,583
That's a bad title.

131
00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:48,420
<i>Meanwhile, Michael went to get
a good deal on a modest company car.</i>

132
00:06:48,527 --> 00:06:51,655
Oh, something like this?
We have, like, 400 of these.

133
00:06:51,763 --> 00:06:53,958
L- I don't need
anything too popular.

134
00:06:54,065 --> 00:06:55,999
Oh, they're not popular.
We have 400 of them.

135
00:06:56,101 --> 00:06:58,001
Sold.

136
00:06:58,103 --> 00:07:02,506
Although, uh, I'm wondering if maybe
it should just be a little bit nicer.

137
00:07:02,607 --> 00:07:05,974
I got a kid, and safety's kind of
a factor. But nothing too flashy.

138
00:07:06,077 --> 00:07:10,013
This is it, isn't it?
I can tell. You're excited.

139
00:07:10,115 --> 00:07:12,083
- I am.
- I'll draw up the papers.

140
00:07:12,184 --> 00:07:15,347
Unless you think it's too drab.

141
00:07:15,454 --> 00:07:17,354
And it gets very good mileage.

142
00:07:17,456 --> 00:07:20,357
Yeah, well, it, uh- it looks light.

143
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:22,552
You know, I'm not
so concerned about mileage.

144
00:07:22,661 --> 00:07:26,153
I spent the last 10 years on a bike,
with the exception of the stair car.

145
00:07:26,264 --> 00:07:28,892
Oh, you're the stair car guy.
You took down our banner.

146
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,026
Yeah. Sorry.
I got a hop-on.

147
00:07:32,137 --> 00:07:34,469
I got distracted.
I hate this.

148
00:07:34,573 --> 00:07:37,667
I like these sunglasses.
They come with any car?

149
00:07:37,776 --> 00:07:41,576
Just this one. They throw these extras
at you because it's so impractical.

150
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,875
No back seat.
It attracts so many tickets...

151
00:07:43,982 --> 00:07:46,644
the insurance alone costs as much
as the last three cars we saw.

152
00:07:46,751 --> 00:07:48,651
The windbreaker?
Windbreaker comes with it too?

153
00:07:48,753 --> 00:07:51,381
I guess. I don't know. I've never
sold one of these before, so-

154
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:54,220
I'll take it.

155
00:07:57,327 --> 00:08:00,819
<i>Michael had just indulged
himself with an expensive sports car-</i>

156
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,830
And here again, please.

157
00:08:02,932 --> 00:08:06,163
<i>While Buster indulged
in a night out with Tobias.</i>

158
00:08:06,269 --> 00:08:08,499
This place is exactly
what I had hoped for.

159
00:08:08,605 --> 00:08:11,665
- All ladies.
- Mmm.

160
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:14,335
Well, I've heard that this uniform
is the best way to meet-

161
00:08:14,444 --> 00:08:17,413
- Lucille 2!
- Buster!

162
00:08:17,514 --> 00:08:20,915
- So you're back.
- Oh, I'm back, Buster!

163
00:08:21,017 --> 00:08:24,578
- Yeah?
- And I am rock steady! No more dizzies.

164
00:08:24,688 --> 00:08:27,054
<i>Lucille Austero had just returned...</i>

165
00:08:27,157 --> 00:08:32,094
<i>from a month-long stay at a facility that
specialized in the treatment of vertigo.</i>

166
00:08:32,195 --> 00:08:35,392
Ah. Ah, just a minute. You're okay.

167
00:08:35,498 --> 00:08:37,898
You're okay. You're okay.
We're okay. We're okay!

168
00:08:38,001 --> 00:08:41,300
Somebody'll be here in a second.
We're okay. We're okay.

169
00:08:41,404 --> 00:08:43,372
I am stable as a table.

170
00:08:43,473 --> 00:08:47,637
So, is there a-
a girl in your life?

171
00:08:47,744 --> 00:08:51,305
Well, I would hardly
call my mother a girl.

172
00:08:51,414 --> 00:08:53,644
But, yeah, she's still
very much a part of my life.

173
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:57,777
No, I mean, uh, someone
who makes you hear music.

174
00:08:57,887 --> 00:09:00,856
Oh. Well, she mostly
likes talk radio.

175
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:05,656
I mean, a girl who
makes you feel romantic...

176
00:09:05,762 --> 00:09:09,095
and also who makes you
hear beautiful music.

177
00:09:09,199 --> 00:09:11,258
Oh. No.

178
00:09:11,367 --> 00:09:15,269
I guess what I'm trying to say is-

179
00:09:18,775 --> 00:09:21,573
Everybody thinks
they're Frank Sinatra.

180
00:09:21,678 --> 00:09:25,011
- Maybe we could start anew.

181
00:09:28,118 --> 00:09:31,349
<i>And later, Michael got
an urgent call from his mother.</i>

182
00:09:31,454 --> 00:09:35,618
He's with her again.
Buster's taken up with that Lucille 2.

183
00:09:35,725 --> 00:09:37,625
That's why you called me here?

184
00:09:37,727 --> 00:09:40,389
I've got my secretary bringing over
a bunch of important papers.

185
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:42,931
- I thought this was urgent.
- Well, it's all your fault.

186
00:09:43,032 --> 00:09:45,933
You're the one who insisted
he get away from Mother.

187
00:09:46,035 --> 00:09:48,936
Well, I wasn't trying to send him
to a new one. Where is he?

188
00:09:49,038 --> 00:09:50,938
He's on the balcony.

189
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,736
Buster?

190
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,038
Mom's becoming a little controlling.

191
00:09:56,146 --> 00:09:58,614
<i>What tripped you off? When she
locked you out on the balcony again?</i>

192
00:09:58,715 --> 00:10:02,708
That was half my fault. I thought
I saw a graham cracker out there.

193
00:10:02,819 --> 00:10:05,982
<i>- You baited the balcony?
- Prove it.</i>

194
00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:08,421
<i>So I don't typically
take sides with Mother...</i>

195
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:11,255
but l-l-I do agree that Lucille 2...

196
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:14,489
might not be
the best choice for you.

197
00:10:14,597 --> 00:10:17,293
I wouldn't even have been there
if Mom wanted to go bowling.

198
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,800
How am I gonna meet someone
who has my interests?

199
00:10:19,903 --> 00:10:21,461
- Hi, Michael.
- Hey. Great.

200
00:10:21,571 --> 00:10:23,471
- I have those papers for you to sign.
- Perfect.

201
00:10:23,573 --> 00:10:25,734
<i>By the way, I love your mother.</i>

202
00:10:25,842 --> 00:10:28,208
- Oh, yeah, I do too.
- Oh.

203
00:10:30,013 --> 00:10:33,449
I think I may have found
a new girl for Buster.

204
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:37,452
Good. That Lucille isn't really
interested in Buster anyway.

205
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:40,990
- She's just trying to get even with me.
- Get even with you for what?

206
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:44,685
She wanted me to let in her remodeling
crew while she was out of town.

207
00:10:44,794 --> 00:10:48,025
Wait a minute. This tub's
a little bigger than it used to be.

208
00:10:48,131 --> 00:10:51,692
<i>It was.
Instead ofletting the construction crew...</i>

209
00:10:51,801 --> 00:10:53,701
<i>- into Lucille Austero's penthouse-
- Come right in.</i>

210
00:10:53,803 --> 00:10:56,533
<i>Lucille had put them to work
on a project ofher own.</i>

211
00:10:57,941 --> 00:11:01,843
- What'd you do?
- Well, I sat on one of these jets.

212
00:11:01,945 --> 00:11:05,472
<i>- But I think we can fix it.
- Don't give me that look.</i>

213
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:09,348
I moved the wall a couple
of inches into her penthouse.

214
00:11:09,452 --> 00:11:13,047
Don't think she's not over there
right now, plotting her revenge.

215
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:18,951
God, the new equilibrium
really does-

216
00:11:19,062 --> 00:11:21,860
It makes the room seem tighter.

217
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:25,566
<i>She's always a step ahead of me.</i>

218
00:11:25,668 --> 00:11:27,727
That's what makes her
such a worthy opponent.

219
00:11:27,837 --> 00:11:31,500
- How'd you pay for it?
- I cashed in some stock. You knew it was unfrozen.

220
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:35,374
I know. I sent you that letter. It says
not to sell, or we're gonna lose control.

221
00:11:35,478 --> 00:11:39,039
<i>It does? I stopped at "unfrozen."</i>

222
00:11:39,148 --> 00:11:42,379
<i>Lindsay, you didn't cash in your stock,
did you? Tell me you didn't.</i>

223
00:11:42,485 --> 00:11:44,385
<i>- I didn't.
- Yet.</i>

224
00:11:44,487 --> 00:11:47,115
There's a pretty long wait list
for membership right now.

225
00:11:47,223 --> 00:11:49,555
Gob, you didn't sell, did you?

226
00:11:49,659 --> 00:11:54,255
What? No. I'm trying to get
a job from you, Mikey. Come on.

227
00:11:54,364 --> 00:11:57,060
Okay. As long as you two didn't sell,
I think we should be okay.

228
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,396
- I was afraid that l-
- I just bought the Queen Mary.

229
00:11:59,502 --> 00:12:02,232
<i>You're kidding.
I was just gonna get a yacht.</i>

230
00:12:02,338 --> 00:12:06,240
No, no, no. The club. I was dancing with
what turned out to be the club's owner...

231
00:12:06,342 --> 00:12:09,334
and he was looking to sell.

232
00:12:09,445 --> 00:12:12,005
Oh, he really, really
did look like a woman.

233
00:12:12,115 --> 00:12:15,414
But anyhoo, can you believe that
the only reason the club is going under...

234
00:12:15,518 --> 00:12:17,577
is because it's
in a terrifying neighborhood?

235
00:12:17,687 --> 00:12:20,349
- This is unbelievable.
- Tobias, I promised that money
to the country club.

236
00:12:20,456 --> 00:12:23,914
- Country club?
- It's in such a good neighborhood.

237
00:12:24,027 --> 00:12:26,188
I don't believe this.
Did you guys not read the letter?

238
00:12:26,296 --> 00:12:29,595
<i>None of them
had read past the word "unfrozen."</i>

239
00:12:29,699 --> 00:12:31,690
I hope you're all proud of yourselves.

240
00:12:31,801 --> 00:12:35,168
Your careless, selfish spending sprees
may have cost us the Bluth Company.

241
00:12:35,271 --> 00:12:37,171
Hey, Dad, is that
your new car in the driveway?

242
00:12:37,273 --> 00:12:40,208
I can't believe you got a Corvette!

243
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:42,972
It's a company car.

244
00:12:46,116 --> 00:12:48,607
<i>Michael had bought a car...</i>

245
00:12:48,718 --> 00:12:50,948
<i>and it had helped
put the company in jeopardy.</i>

246
00:12:51,054 --> 00:12:54,820
I'm sorry about the patch. I'm testifying
against the Kings this afternoon.

247
00:12:54,924 --> 00:12:57,324
You can't see it. I just winked.

248
00:12:57,427 --> 00:13:01,557
<i>So basically, you're
about 2,000 shares short...</i>

249
00:13:01,664 --> 00:13:04,132
of being the majority stockholders.

250
00:13:04,234 --> 00:13:06,634
<i>Now unfortunately, it's a private stock...</i>

251
00:13:06,736 --> 00:13:10,467
<i>so you cannotjust buy up the shares
unless someone is willing to sell.</i>

252
00:13:10,573 --> 00:13:13,235
- Are you sure?
- That's what they said on AskJeeves.

253
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:16,835
- All right, who's the majority shareholder now?
- A company called Standpoor.

254
00:13:16,946 --> 00:13:21,042
- Standpoor?
- As in the opposite of Sitwell...

255
00:13:21,151 --> 00:13:23,551
which is run by a certain
hairless man...

256
00:13:23,653 --> 00:13:25,883
who could be very upset
with you right now.

257
00:13:25,989 --> 00:13:28,184
What would he have to be upset
with me about?

258
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:32,159
- You're wearing his eyebrows?
- They make me feel dressier.

259
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:37,298
- Hello?
- Is it true, Michael? Did we lose the company?

260
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,200
Kind of. To something called
Standpoor. Yeah, it's Sitwell.

261
00:13:41,304 --> 00:13:44,740
- It's Lucille Austero.
- Lucille 2?

262
00:13:44,841 --> 00:13:48,368
<i>Standpoor, because she can't
stand up without falling over.</i>

263
00:13:48,478 --> 00:13:52,039
I don't know why she'd have any trouble.
A piano could stand on those legs.

264
00:13:52,148 --> 00:13:54,708
<i>She's trying to get even
with me for the remodeling.</i>

265
00:13:54,817 --> 00:13:58,253
I think we're gonna need
a new floating thermometer.

266
00:13:58,354 --> 00:14:00,686
Could I have your-
your Blue Cross number?

267
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:05,284
Well, let's think about this, Mom. I mean,
maybe there's a way that we can reason with her-

268
00:14:05,395 --> 00:14:07,295
- Give her Buster.
- What?

269
00:14:07,397 --> 00:14:10,525
- We need our company back.
- Mom, that's horrible.

270
00:14:10,633 --> 00:14:14,034
<i>I don't suppose you've spent money
on something you can return?</i>

271
00:14:14,137 --> 00:14:15,968
<i>- Sweet ride, dude.
- Let's give her Buster.</i>

272
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,140
Starla, do you know
where my brother is?

273
00:14:19,242 --> 00:14:21,870
<i>Yes, he's on cloud nine.
That was me, Michael.</i>

274
00:14:21,978 --> 00:14:24,105
What's going on?
Where's Starla?

275
00:14:24,214 --> 00:14:26,580
Oh, she's saying good-bye
to someone named Q.

276
00:14:26,683 --> 00:14:29,719
If she can get past his security system,
she's gonna tell him it's over.

277
00:14:29,719 --> 00:14:30,481
If she can get past his security system,
she's gonna tell him it's over.

278
00:14:30,587 --> 00:14:32,578
She's amazing.

279
00:14:32,689 --> 00:14:36,489
We completely connected.
And it's all because of you.

280
00:14:36,593 --> 00:14:39,426
You made this happen.

281
00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:41,429
I feel alive!

282
00:14:41,531 --> 00:14:44,659
<i>Indeed,
Starla and Buster did hit it off well-</i>

283
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:48,897
<i>Buster being a sweeter, more supportive
man than she was used to...</i>

284
00:14:49,005 --> 00:14:51,735
<i>and Starla being a woman
that wasn't 70.</i>

285
00:14:51,841 --> 00:14:56,744
<i>I'm just wondering if you
didn't upgrade a little too fast.</i>

286
00:14:56,846 --> 00:15:01,249
You know, you want something sensible, you
end up getting pushed into something flashy.

287
00:15:01,351 --> 00:15:03,114
What does that mean?

288
00:15:03,219 --> 00:15:05,585
Don't you think
you belong in a Lucille?

289
00:15:11,894 --> 00:15:14,419
<i>Maeby, meanwhile,
gave reading her script another shot...</i>

290
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:17,795
<i>only to discover her work was done.</i>

291
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,266
<i>Her scripts had been noted.</i>

292
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:23,066
<i>So she went to find the person
she thought was responsible.</i>

293
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,606
George Michael,
I read your notes.

294
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:28,768
What? You-
Oh, you found the-

295
00:15:28,878 --> 00:15:31,176
- Well, look, I don't-That was a long-
- They were great.

296
00:15:31,281 --> 00:15:35,217
I mean, they said so many things I wanted
to say, but I didn't know how, you know?

297
00:15:35,318 --> 00:15:37,286
Don't tell anyone, okay?

298
00:15:37,387 --> 00:15:39,947
Never.

299
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:45,686
I guess she didn't see the drawings.

300
00:15:45,795 --> 00:15:49,231
<i>Meanwhile, Tobias prepared
to assume ownership of the Queen Mary.</i>

301
00:15:49,332 --> 00:15:52,631
No, no. It's supposed to say
"Tobias's Queen Mary."

302
00:15:52,735 --> 00:15:56,796
No, that is not what it says.
I distinct- Hello?

303
00:15:58,241 --> 00:16:00,539
Well, I suppose I could just
paint over "Mary."

304
00:16:00,643 --> 00:16:03,134
Don't bother, man.
This is our club now.

305
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:11,713
<i>Tobias didn't want to sell
his new club, but Lindsay did.</i>

306
00:16:11,821 --> 00:16:15,985
<i>Which is why she hired several members
of a local stripper agency...</i>

307
00:16:16,092 --> 00:16:18,890
<i>called the Hot Cops
to pose as the roughnecks.</i>

308
00:16:18,995 --> 00:16:22,158
All right, fellas, look. I know you know
nothing but a life on the street...

309
00:16:22,265 --> 00:16:25,166
but I'd like to offer you something
that the Queen Mary gave me.

310
00:16:25,268 --> 00:16:27,202
The joy of the stage.

311
00:16:27,303 --> 00:16:30,329
So maybe you could, uh,
start jeté-ing...

312
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,841
and stop "je-terrorizing" me.

313
00:16:33,943 --> 00:16:36,776
- Yeah!
- Absolutely!

314
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:39,507
<i>- We could do Rent.
- Well, this is joyous news.</i>

315
00:16:39,615 --> 00:16:42,607
<i>And Buster,
now convinced that Lucille 2...</i>

316
00:16:42,719 --> 00:16:46,348
<i>was the right woman for him,
broke up with Starla.</i>

317
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:49,790
You okay?

318
00:16:49,892 --> 00:16:52,190
It was for the best anyway.

319
00:16:52,295 --> 00:16:56,231
A girl like that deserves to be taken
care of, and I'm just a poor soldier.

320
00:16:56,332 --> 00:16:58,857
You didn't sell your stock?

321
00:16:58,968 --> 00:17:01,903
What? No. Your letter said not to...

322
00:17:02,004 --> 00:17:04,268
and I would never
want to hurt the family.

323
00:17:04,374 --> 00:17:06,842
<i>And Michael realized his little brother...</i>

324
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:09,070
<i>deserved happiness more than anyone.</i>

325
00:17:09,178 --> 00:17:11,942
You know, uh, I want you
to forget about what I said.

326
00:17:12,048 --> 00:17:13,948
I was wrong.
You two belong together.

327
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:16,109
I'll take care of Lucille 2 for you.

328
00:17:16,219 --> 00:17:18,210
- Really?
- Yeah.

329
00:17:18,321 --> 00:17:22,724
Let her down easy. That right knee
could go at any time.

330
00:17:22,825 --> 00:17:25,225
Starla!

331
00:17:25,328 --> 00:17:28,229
<i>And at the "Tobias is Queen Mary"...</i>

332
00:17:28,331 --> 00:17:30,993
<i>Tobias couldn't believe
how quickly he had gotten through...</i>

333
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:35,560
<i>to his ragtag gang of neighborhood toughs.</i>

334
00:17:35,671 --> 00:17:39,573
Wow. You really have made
some amazing strides in a half an hour.

335
00:17:39,675 --> 00:17:41,734
<i>We have to take this to the streets.</i>

336
00:17:41,844 --> 00:17:44,244
We have to strut!

337
00:17:44,347 --> 00:17:46,406
<i>Michael knew ifhe had any chance...</i>

338
00:17:46,516 --> 00:17:48,848
<i>of getting control of the company again...</i>

339
00:17:48,951 --> 00:17:51,010
<i>- he would need to charm Lucille 2.
- Lucille 2.</i>

340
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,281
- Your hair!
- Can I take you for a spin?

341
00:17:53,389 --> 00:17:57,348
<i>But the spin in Michael's
new car retriggered her vertigo.</i>

342
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:01,590
<i>That night, Tobias's plan
to change the streets with his gang...</i>

343
00:18:01,697 --> 00:18:04,291
<i>also turned out to be ill-conceived.</i>

344
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,631
<i>Hey, "fezellas,"looks like
you guys are up to no good.</i>

345
00:18:07,737 --> 00:18:12,436
Well, this gang used to be
like that too- three, four!

346
00:18:12,542 --> 00:18:15,443
So you think you're tough
Well, we hate rappin'

347
00:18:15,545 --> 00:18:18,013
But don't bust a cap in
'Cause here's what's happenin'

348
00:18:18,114 --> 00:18:21,277
<i>We're breakin'out
some old-fashioned tappin'</i>

349
00:18:23,419 --> 00:18:25,319
Oh, I've been shot!

350
00:18:25,421 --> 00:18:28,788
<i>- We miscalculated! Retreat!
- Quick, switch to Follies!</i>

351
00:18:28,891 --> 00:18:31,223
That's not gonna help!

352
00:18:31,327 --> 00:18:35,661
<i>Meanwhile, Michael and
Lucille 2 arrived to find the club nearly empty.</i>

353
00:18:35,765 --> 00:18:37,824
<i>Although Michael
would have fit in perfectly.</i>

354
00:18:37,934 --> 00:18:40,869
Something? It's probably-
I'll tell you what, Lucille.

355
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:43,768
- I'm gonna take you dancing, huh?
- No, Michael, please.

356
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:46,808
You have undone all
of Dr. Sandor Plumb's work.

357
00:18:46,909 --> 00:18:51,312
Oh, I'm sorry. Look, the reason
that I showed up tonight...

358
00:18:51,414 --> 00:18:55,407
was because I don't think that it's right
for you to be dating my brother.

359
00:18:55,518 --> 00:18:58,180
I mean, he's met someone else,
and, frankly...

360
00:18:58,287 --> 00:19:00,380
the only reason that
he asked you out tonight...

361
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:03,755
was because I wanted him to get
the stock back from you...

362
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:06,351
so that I could regain
control of the company.

363
00:19:06,462 --> 00:19:09,863
But I would- I'd rather
have my brother back.

364
00:19:09,966 --> 00:19:12,662
So- I'm sorry.

365
00:19:12,768 --> 00:19:14,861
- I understand.
- Thank you.

366
00:19:14,971 --> 00:19:19,533
And I do not blame you for
not liking the Bluths anymore.

367
00:19:19,642 --> 00:19:22,440
Like the Bluths?
I love the Bluths.

368
00:19:22,545 --> 00:19:26,345
- Why did you buy up all of our company stock?
- To support you guys.

369
00:19:26,449 --> 00:19:32,183
I have always had a standing order
to buy up any available Bluth stock.

370
00:19:32,288 --> 00:19:35,951
You do know that we're about 2,000 shares
short of controlling the company now.

371
00:19:36,058 --> 00:19:39,221
- Well, you could have some of mine.
- Really? Would you do that?

372
00:19:39,328 --> 00:19:42,058
- Yeah, of course.
- Well, that's-Thank you.

373
00:19:42,164 --> 00:19:44,462
- Actually, there is a condition.
- Anything.

374
00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:49,231
- Call me a cab.
- Ah, because of my driving. Yes.

375
00:19:49,338 --> 00:19:51,397
<i>And so the next day...</i>

376
00:19:51,507 --> 00:19:54,271
<i>Michael was thrilled to have
control of the company back.</i>

377
00:19:54,377 --> 00:19:56,345
<i>- I fixed everything.
- Oh?</i>

378
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:59,437
With the business.
It's all taken care of.

379
00:19:59,549 --> 00:20:03,144
- You didn't think I could, but I did.
- Gob, what'd you do?

380
00:20:03,252 --> 00:20:07,382
<i>Hi.
- Gob had run into Lucille 2
after Michael dropped her off.</i>

381
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:09,549
My mom really took up
a bunch of your space, huh?

382
00:20:09,659 --> 00:20:12,219
- What a bitch.
- What do you mean?

383
00:20:12,328 --> 00:20:15,161
When she expanded her bathroom
and moved your wall over.

384
00:20:15,264 --> 00:20:18,062
That's why all your stuff s
sticking out.

385
00:20:18,167 --> 00:20:20,567
Oh.

386
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:26,074
Your mother really has a way of getting my goat.

387
00:20:26,175 --> 00:20:28,143
<i>So Gob- Lucille 2.</i>

388
00:20:28,244 --> 00:20:32,112
- You what?
- Oh, and she's not gonna give
the shares back now.

389
00:20:32,214 --> 00:20:35,411
<i>- You just said that you fixed everything.
- Oh, I meant my problems.</i>

390
00:20:35,518 --> 00:20:38,078
Yeah, she's gonna make me
the new president.

391
00:20:39,622 --> 00:20:43,854
You don't need to prove
yourself to me, little brother.

392
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,758
You will always have a job here.

393
00:20:46,862 --> 00:20:49,490
But I do need the keys
to the company car.

394
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,861
<i>On the next Arrested Development-</i>

395
00:20:54,971 --> 00:20:57,906
<i>Lucille 2 reclaims some space.</i>

396
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:02,810
<i>The Queen Mary
changes hands once again.</i>

397
00:21:02,912 --> 00:21:06,814
L-I've wanted a small family restaurant
since I got the Kings settlement.

398
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:09,146
It still has the dungeon area, right?

399
00:21:09,251 --> 00:21:11,583
<i>And Gob gets needy.</i>

400
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,917
- Oh.
- Let's go for it.
