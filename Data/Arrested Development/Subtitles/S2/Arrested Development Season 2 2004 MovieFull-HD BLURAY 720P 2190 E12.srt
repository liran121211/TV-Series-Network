1
00:00:01,007 --> 00:00:04,408
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:06,501
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:06,612 --> 00:00:08,603
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:14,153 --> 00:00:15,848
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

5
00:00:18,057 --> 00:00:20,389
<i>George Michael?
Michael was looking for his son...</i>

6
00:00:20,493 --> 00:00:22,586
<i>with whom he had a secret to share.</i>

7
00:00:22,695 --> 00:00:25,596
- There you are. Hey, pal. You alone?
- Almost always, yeah.

8
00:00:25,698 --> 00:00:28,030
<i>You know,
Maeby's never around anymore...</i>

9
00:00:28,134 --> 00:00:30,796
<i>and Ann's off with her religious group,
trying to get Nip/Tuck off the air.</i>

10
00:00:30,903 --> 00:00:33,463
<i>- They don't like Nip/Tuck?
- Well, you know, they don't like anything.</i>

11
00:00:33,572 --> 00:00:36,040
Something about God wants people
to age naturally- I don't know.

12
00:00:36,142 --> 00:00:38,042
Ironically, she likes Gangy.

13
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:42,706
Listen, you know, I would never date anyone
without you being okay with it, right?

14
00:00:42,815 --> 00:00:46,911
- You don't have to do that.
- Great, because I didn't do it this time.

15
00:00:47,019 --> 00:00:52,047
<i>L- I kind of reconnected with that blind
prosecutor I used to date, Maggie Lizer.</i>

16
00:00:52,158 --> 00:00:53,887
Her?

17
00:00:53,993 --> 00:00:57,258
<i>- Didn't she turn out to not be blind though?
- Exactly.</i>

18
00:00:57,363 --> 00:01:00,264
But she's filled out a little bit.

19
00:01:00,366 --> 00:01:02,994
<i>Michael hadn't seen her
in eight and a half months...</i>

20
00:01:03,102 --> 00:01:05,070
<i>during which she had filled out.</i>

21
00:01:05,171 --> 00:01:07,401
Really?
Could have sworn it was a year.

22
00:01:07,506 --> 00:01:12,136
And it seems as if I'm the father.

23
00:01:12,244 --> 00:01:14,838
Do you know this for sure?
I mean, she does lie.

24
00:01:14,947 --> 00:01:17,472
- She might not really be pregnant.
- See, that's what I thought.

25
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:19,483
- Boy, you really are my kid.
- Good.

26
00:01:19,585 --> 00:01:22,179
Apparently, so is this one.

27
00:01:22,288 --> 00:01:24,756
<i>Michael found this out
after having Lindsay and Tobias...</i>

28
00:01:24,857 --> 00:01:28,190
<i>break into Maggie's house
and hide in the bathroom...</i>

29
00:01:28,294 --> 00:01:30,262
<i>to collect and test her urine.</i>

30
00:01:30,362 --> 00:01:34,696
<i>- It was there that they stumbled upon a fat suit.
- That's what it is.</i>

31
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,825
<i>Michael confronted Maggie about this.</i>

32
00:01:36,936 --> 00:01:40,667
Oh, you're so right, Michael,
'cause I'm fakin' it-

33
00:01:40,773 --> 00:01:44,209
<i>- But he was proven wrong.
- Not.</i>

34
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,473
<i>Maybe it'll be exciting, you know?
Be a big brother. It'll be fun.</i>

35
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:50,606
- There you go. It would be fun, wouldn't it?
- Big brother. Me.

36
00:01:50,716 --> 00:01:53,116
Not gonna happen though.
She doesn't want anything to do with me.

37
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:56,882
But I know you've been bored.
You and I are gonna have some fun together.

38
00:01:56,989 --> 00:01:59,617
Maybe we'll even have ourselves
a little adventure.

39
00:01:59,725 --> 00:02:02,751
- Yeah.
- Meanwhile, I guess
this family's big enough, huh?

40
00:02:02,862 --> 00:02:06,059
<i>In fact, Michael's family
had just gotten a little smaller.</i>

41
00:02:06,165 --> 00:02:08,258
Hello?

42
00:02:08,367 --> 00:02:11,063
Mom, you've got to stop
starting conversations like that.

43
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:14,799
Something happened to Buster.
He lost part of his body.

44
00:02:14,907 --> 00:02:17,808
- I don't know which one.
- The hand.

45
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,344
I told him to stay out of the ocean,
but we had a fight.

46
00:02:20,446 --> 00:02:22,573
<i>- Who remembers about what?
- I do.</i>

47
00:02:22,681 --> 00:02:26,515
<i>Buster had discovered that
his Uncle Oscar was his true father.</i>

48
00:02:26,619 --> 00:02:29,144
- You lied to me.
- You were never supposed to know.

49
00:02:29,255 --> 00:02:31,746
I'm going to war!

50
00:02:31,857 --> 00:02:36,157
<i>As an act of defiance to Lucille,
he first went swimming in the ocean...</i>

51
00:02:36,262 --> 00:02:39,026
<i>where he was attacked by a loose seal.</i>

52
00:02:39,131 --> 00:02:41,156
If only your father was here.

53
00:02:41,267 --> 00:02:45,397
- Oh, that George. God only knows where he is.
- The car!

54
00:02:45,504 --> 00:02:49,668
- Up yours, granny!
- You couldn't handle it!

55
00:02:49,775 --> 00:02:52,573
<i>In fact, George Sr.
Had snuck out of the attic...</i>

56
00:02:52,678 --> 00:02:54,976
<i>and gone to a local Ford dealership.</i>

57
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,048
Yeah, the Bronco's been discontinued.

58
00:02:57,149 --> 00:02:59,583
We're trying to shed that whole
"fugitive on the run" thing.

59
00:02:59,685 --> 00:03:02,586
- This is the Escape.
- What a fun name, hmm?

60
00:03:02,688 --> 00:03:04,883
- Mm-hmm.
- May I test-drive?

61
00:03:07,293 --> 00:03:10,524
<i>- Up yours, granny!
- You couldn't handle it!</i>

62
00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:14,030
<i>Soon, Michael and
George Michael arrived at the hospital.</i>

63
00:03:14,133 --> 00:03:17,466
- If something happens to Buster, I'll be lost.
- Yeah. Excuse me.

64
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:20,937
George Michael, you're going to
have to be the baby of the family.

65
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,908
<i>- Um, Maeby's younger than me.
- You're never going in the ocean! Never!</i>

66
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:27,638
- We're here to see him.
- You're my baby! I'm never letting you go!

67
00:03:27,746 --> 00:03:30,738
- Please stay away from my son.
- You're my baby now! No, he's my baby!

68
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:33,113
The hell with all of you.
I have a man.

69
00:03:33,219 --> 00:03:37,053
Excuse me.

70
00:03:37,156 --> 00:03:39,386
<i>- Are you the Bluths?
- Not Dr. Wordsmith.</i>

71
00:03:39,491 --> 00:03:42,085
- How's my son?
- He's going to be all right.

72
00:03:42,194 --> 00:03:44,389
<i>- Thank God.
- Finally some good news from this guy.</i>

73
00:03:44,496 --> 00:03:46,964
- No other way to take that.
- That's a great attitude.

74
00:03:47,066 --> 00:03:50,763
I gotta tell you. If I was given this news,
I don't know that I'd take it this well.

75
00:03:50,869 --> 00:03:52,496
But you said he was all right.

76
00:03:52,605 --> 00:03:56,132
Yes. He's lost his left hand,
so he's going to be "all right."

77
00:03:56,242 --> 00:03:58,676
You son of a bitch!
I hate this doctor!

78
00:03:58,777 --> 00:04:03,510
- He's a very literal man.
- Yes, that's more the way I would take the news.

79
00:04:03,616 --> 00:04:05,516
<i>Actually, I'm relieved.</i>

80
00:04:05,618 --> 00:04:08,746
I don't have to go to army because
the seal with the bow tie attacked me.

81
00:04:08,854 --> 00:04:12,119
- I feel like I've lost three pounds.
- Seal with the bow tie?

82
00:04:12,224 --> 00:04:14,283
Yeah.
I think that's what I saw bite me.

83
00:04:14,393 --> 00:04:18,124
I just wish I could remember why I went
in the ocean. Did we fight or something?

84
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:20,130
Of course not.

85
00:04:20,232 --> 00:04:23,497
Although I always have warned you
against the ocean. So has your father.

86
00:04:23,602 --> 00:04:26,264
My father.

87
00:04:26,372 --> 00:04:28,499
George Sr. You need more juice.

88
00:04:28,607 --> 00:04:32,600
Where's the juice?
Give my son the juice!

89
00:04:32,711 --> 00:04:34,941
Buster, it's okay.
Doctor says you're gonna be fine.

90
00:04:35,047 --> 00:04:37,538
And if they can find the hand,
they're gonna be able to reattach it.

91
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,550
<i>- You know, like a transplant.
- I'm fine.</i>

92
00:04:39,652 --> 00:04:45,284
This is a blessing. And speaking of blessings,
I heard there's gonna be a baby.

93
00:04:45,391 --> 00:04:49,293
Oh, yeah, yeah.
But please, don't worry about that.

94
00:04:49,395 --> 00:04:51,955
What's more important is that you're
really doin' well with this, pal.

95
00:04:52,064 --> 00:04:53,793
My hat is off to you.

96
00:04:53,899 --> 00:04:56,800
And my hand is off to you.

97
00:05:00,239 --> 00:05:03,299
No, no, I meant, don't get
your hopes up about that-

98
00:05:03,409 --> 00:05:06,867
Hand transplant.

99
00:05:06,979 --> 00:05:10,506
No, the, uh, baby.
The mother doesn't want me around.

100
00:05:10,616 --> 00:05:13,346
We kind of had a little bit of a fight.

101
00:05:13,452 --> 00:05:16,649
- You obviously care about
this Maggie woman, don't you?
- Yes, I do. Of course I do.

102
00:05:16,755 --> 00:05:19,519
I mean, a seal didn't bite
your Linus off, did it?

103
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:22,253
- No, a seal didn't bite my Linus off.
- Good.

104
00:05:22,361 --> 00:05:24,352
<i>- Then go to her. Ask for her hand.
- Yeah.</i>

105
00:05:24,463 --> 00:05:27,432
And, uh, maybe...

106
00:05:27,533 --> 00:05:30,229
I'll get one for my brother
while I'm at it.

107
00:05:30,336 --> 00:05:34,204
Yeah. Get him out of here.

108
00:05:34,306 --> 00:05:36,433
- Hmm?
- Get him out of here!

109
00:05:36,542 --> 00:05:38,339
Get the-
Out of my room!

110
00:05:38,444 --> 00:05:40,742
- Oh, my God! Buster!
- Oh, my God!

111
00:05:40,846 --> 00:05:43,940
Buster, what's wrong? Nurse!

112
00:05:44,049 --> 00:05:46,017
<i>So, at his brother's suggestion...</i>

113
00:05:46,118 --> 00:05:48,848
<i>Michael went to the courthouse
determined to win Maggie back.</i>

114
00:05:48,954 --> 00:05:52,014
- Have you seen Maggie? It's kind of important.
- Oh, you just missed her.

115
00:05:52,124 --> 00:05:55,025
She's in the bar.
What a spanking I gave her in court today.

116
00:05:56,128 --> 00:05:58,596
- Go get 'em.
- He spanked me!

117
00:05:58,697 --> 00:06:00,665
- Did you spank her?
- No!

118
00:06:00,766 --> 00:06:04,361
<i>You know, that waitress she's representing
is suing my client for making her fat.</i>

119
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:08,031
But here's the thing.
Loretta is not fat.

120
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:12,099
Maggie bought her a fat suit,
and I've got the receipt to prove it.

121
00:06:12,211 --> 00:06:14,577
Of course.
That's what the fat suit is for.

122
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,581
Well, I've gotta find her. I owe her an apology.
You said she's at a bar?

123
00:06:17,683 --> 00:06:20,777
Friday night. You might want
to try Miss Temple's. Tell her Barry said-

124
00:06:20,886 --> 00:06:23,320
Ooh, I did good today.

125
00:06:23,422 --> 00:06:25,549
<i>And Michael caught up with Maggie.</i>

126
00:06:25,657 --> 00:06:27,591
You know,
there have been lies, yes.

127
00:06:27,693 --> 00:06:31,288
But it's not like either one of us would ever
do anything to hurt the other person.

128
00:06:31,397 --> 00:06:33,297
Hello, Officers.

129
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:36,562
Well, there's no further sign
of a break-in at your house.

130
00:06:36,668 --> 00:06:40,729
<i>And since you haven't called us back, we again
left the number, in case there's a problem.</i>

131
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:43,603
<i>- Thanks, Officer Taylor.
- Just next time, uh, call us back.</i>

132
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:45,734
Hey, the break-in?
I told you that was us.

133
00:06:45,844 --> 00:06:49,610
Well, maybe I did want to hurt you,
because I was hurt.

134
00:06:49,715 --> 00:06:55,654
- The only reason you're here
is out of loyalty to the baby.
- It's not just about the baby.

135
00:06:55,754 --> 00:06:58,621
Maggie, there was a reason that you and I
got together in the first place...

136
00:06:58,724 --> 00:07:00,692
when we made this baby, okay?

137
00:07:00,793 --> 00:07:05,423
There's something here, as long
as we never lie to each other again.

138
00:07:05,531 --> 00:07:08,864
Well, then I have to come clean
about one more thing.

139
00:07:08,967 --> 00:07:10,935
- Oh, no.
- You're not the father.

140
00:07:11,036 --> 00:07:12,503
Come on.

141
00:07:12,604 --> 00:07:16,301
I went to a sperm bank, okay,
the week before we even met.

142
00:07:16,408 --> 00:07:20,105
The father's some guy from Harvard,
but that's all I know.

143
00:07:20,212 --> 00:07:23,306
<i>That's great. He's probably
some geek Simpsons writer's kid.</i>

144
00:07:23,415 --> 00:07:25,781
I never thought
I'd meet someone like you.

145
00:07:25,884 --> 00:07:27,613
- Mmm.
- But come on.

146
00:07:27,719 --> 00:07:30,620
I mean, do you still really want me?

147
00:07:30,722 --> 00:07:32,519
Are you really that great of a guy?

148
00:07:32,624 --> 00:07:36,424
<i>Michael had always thought
ofhimself as that great a guy.</i>

149
00:07:36,528 --> 00:07:40,794
<i>- The kind of guy who could
raise someone else's baby.
- Of course I am.</i>

150
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:42,867
<i>But he wasn't...</i>

151
00:07:42,968 --> 00:07:45,801
<i>and he regretted it the moment he said it.</i>

152
00:07:49,152 --> 00:07:52,918
<i>The next day, the family gathered
to welcome Buster home from the hospital.</i>

153
00:07:53,023 --> 00:07:55,218
<i>He's coming.
What he's wearing is temporary.</i>

154
00:07:55,325 --> 00:08:00,262
Please don't comment on it or salute him
like that idiot guard down there did to him.

155
00:08:00,363 --> 00:08:03,628
Well, look who's back.

156
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,928
<i>- Let's all say hello.
- Hi.</i>

157
00:08:06,036 --> 00:08:09,233
And while you're at it,
let's all give me a big hand!

158
00:08:14,344 --> 00:08:17,404
George Michael, get your uncle
a bandage for his forehead.

159
00:08:17,514 --> 00:08:19,482
And while you're at it, uh, get two.

160
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:20,982
Oh, my God.

161
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:23,882
Guess this means you don't wanna
play "got your nose" with me.

162
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,653
Oh, what's the matter, Buster?

163
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,658
- Did you hurt yourself?
- Uh, hi, Gob.

164
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,228
Oh, my God! What-What happened to your-
He's got no hand!

165
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:35,298
Buster went swimming in the ocean...

166
00:08:35,398 --> 00:08:38,094
and, according to him,
a seal with a bow tie bit off his hand.

167
00:08:38,201 --> 00:08:39,566
Bow tie?

168
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:42,797
It's merely the playful mutterings
of the shock victim.

169
00:08:42,906 --> 00:08:44,965
A seal would never prey on a human...

170
00:08:45,075 --> 00:08:47,839
unless, of course, it had acquired
a taste for mammal blood.

171
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,242
<i>Gob had recently dressed a seal in a bow tie...</i>

172
00:08:50,347 --> 00:08:52,815
<i>and used him in a magic trick.</i>

173
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:55,441
<i>When it failed,
he released the seal into the ocean.</i>

174
00:08:55,552 --> 00:08:59,511
You're back in the real world.
You're not gonna be hand-fed anymore.

175
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:02,353
How the hell would a seal know
how to tie a bow tie anyway?

176
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:06,828
- I can barely tie
the yellow one that I wear in my act.
- This one had a yellow bow tie!

177
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,522
Really?

178
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:11,430
<i>And later, Lucille
could not contain her guilt any longer.</i>

179
00:09:11,534 --> 00:09:15,368
I did this. I prayed that God
take anything he wanted from us...

180
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,372
so that Buster wouldn't
have to go to war.

181
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:21,103
Oh, Mom. After all these years,
God's not gonna take a call from you.

182
00:09:21,211 --> 00:09:23,338
<i>I did this.</i>

183
00:09:23,446 --> 00:09:26,040
<i>I think that the seal with
the yellow bow tie might be the one...</i>

184
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:29,380
that I released into the sea after giving it
the taste for mammal blood.

185
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:32,546
Okay. You've got a better case
than Mom does.

186
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:35,056
Still, I could hunt down that seal.

187
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:38,787
They said if you retrieve Buster's hand,
they might be able to do a transplant.

188
00:09:38,895 --> 00:09:42,661
At the very least, I can remove
that incriminating bow tie.

189
00:09:42,766 --> 00:09:45,826
<i>And Michael told Lindsay
about his commitment to Maggie...</i>

190
00:09:45,935 --> 00:09:47,903
<i>and the child that wasn't his.</i>

191
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:51,303
<i>Well, first of all, I'm sure there are writers
on The Simpsons who aren't geeks.</i>

192
00:09:51,408 --> 00:09:54,343
And secondly, I think this commitment
you're making is great.

193
00:09:54,444 --> 00:09:56,344
It is. It's great, it's great.

194
00:09:56,446 --> 00:09:59,506
I do think something might be up though.
What if she's still lying?

195
00:09:59,616 --> 00:10:01,914
Oh, no. You're trying to
get out of this, aren't you?

196
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,248
- L-I thought you were a good guy.
- I am a good guy.

197
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:07,414
- Is he trying to get out of having this baby?
- We want this child.

198
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:10,049
It's given us a reason to stay together.

199
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,754
<i>In fact,
it was investigating the pregnancy...</i>

200
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:16,593
<i>that had reignited
Lindsay and Tobias's passion.</i>

201
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,668
<i>It was weird.</i>

202
00:10:18,768 --> 00:10:20,736
- Where's your child?
- I don't have a child, Michael.

203
00:10:20,837 --> 00:10:23,305
- We don't have a child, Michael.
- That's why we want-

204
00:10:23,406 --> 00:10:25,567
- Oh.
- Did you mean Maeby?

205
00:10:25,675 --> 00:10:29,771
- I did mean Maeby.
- Well, she's hardly a child, is she, Michael?

206
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,847
Yeah. And we know where she is.

207
00:10:31,948 --> 00:10:35,782
She's with her debate club, and they're on
their way to Sacremende for the semifinals.

208
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,785
<i>She wasn't.</i>

209
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:41,983
<i>And a Google search of the word
"Sacremende"only came up with this.</i>

210
00:10:42,092 --> 00:10:46,392
<i>In fact, she was overseeing a remake
ofThe Old Man And The Sea...</i>

211
00:10:46,496 --> 00:10:49,897
<i>for the film studio where she'd
bluffed her way into a job.</i>

212
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:51,967
What on earth is taking so long?

213
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,593
Am I the only one who wants
to get home and see their kids?

214
00:10:54,704 --> 00:10:57,298
<i>So please don't tell me
I don't know where my kid is.</i>

215
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:01,741
All I'm saying is that Maggie claims
that no one else is involved.

216
00:11:01,845 --> 00:11:04,746
But what if she's lying again
and there is someone else involved?

217
00:11:04,848 --> 00:11:07,180
You know, a boyfriend, a husband.

218
00:11:07,283 --> 00:11:10,446
Someone that got dumped
when something better came along.

219
00:11:10,553 --> 00:11:13,750
- Of course. Why wouldn't she?
- I'm a good guy, you know.

220
00:11:13,857 --> 00:11:16,325
So I'm thinkin' maybe you can
break into her house again for me...

221
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,155
and see if you can find some, uh-

222
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:20,821
Way out of this for you?
I don't think so.

223
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:25,026
No, I was gonna say, find some evidence
of who the father is, but forget it.

224
00:11:25,135 --> 00:11:29,094
I'll find somebody
who wants an adventure.

225
00:11:29,205 --> 00:11:32,299
George Michael, how would
you like to get away from Uncle Buster?

226
00:11:32,409 --> 00:11:34,377
- I'd really like that.
- Good. Shh, shh, shh.

227
00:11:34,477 --> 00:11:37,207
<i>And so, with his son's help,
Michael went to Maggie's...</i>

228
00:11:37,313 --> 00:11:39,247
<i>to find some evidence of another man.</i>

229
00:11:39,349 --> 00:11:41,817
It's another Bluth Boy adventure.
We're like a team.

230
00:11:41,918 --> 00:11:44,250
- We're like Red McGibbon and Bullet.
- Who?

231
00:11:44,354 --> 00:11:46,322
They're this old, uh-
Never mind. Okay, listen.

232
00:11:46,423 --> 00:11:49,859
<i>Anything you find in there-name, phone
number-you bring it out to Daddy, all right?</i>

233
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,950
- You mean you're not going in with me?
- Hmm? No.

234
00:11:52,061 --> 00:11:54,359
I can't fit through that doggy door.

235
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:57,922
But I am gonna risk being caught out here.
Be careful.

236
00:11:59,702 --> 00:12:03,160
Okay, I got a phone number.
Let's go. Drive.

237
00:12:03,273 --> 00:12:05,434
- Let's go. Hit the gas.
- You didn't even go inside.

238
00:12:05,542 --> 00:12:08,136
- It was taped to the door.
- It's probably the Sparkletts guy.

239
00:12:08,244 --> 00:12:11,543
Listen, it's okay. I'm telling you.
There's nothing to be scared about.

240
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:14,378
I'm not getting that vibe. Hey!

241
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,452
- Everything all right?
- Yes, Officer.

242
00:12:16,553 --> 00:12:19,044
- Just waiting to see if Maggie's home.
- Oh.

243
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:22,124
I was making sure there wasn't
another break-in.

244
00:12:22,225 --> 00:12:24,557
My partner is inside
with his gun drawn.

245
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:27,221
Everything's gonna be just fine.

246
00:12:30,033 --> 00:12:33,059
Close call there, Bullet.
I'm so sorry about that.

247
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:37,128
<i>But listen, I think- I think that you do have
something here with this phone number.</i>

248
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,265
"Really eager to hear from you."

249
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:42,503
You know, that's something a guy would say
if he was the father of her child...

250
00:12:42,612 --> 00:12:45,479
and the mother stopped calling
'cause she found a really good guy.

251
00:12:45,582 --> 00:12:49,074
I think this is him. I'm gettin' that vibe.
We're havin' some fun, aren't we?

252
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,914
I'm really sorry about that.

253
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:55,354
<i>Gob arrived at the dock,
hoping to recover his brother's missing hand.</i>

254
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:58,985
I'm lookin' for the seal
that's got the taste for kitty blood.

255
00:12:59,095 --> 00:13:01,427
I'll pay you handsomely.

256
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:04,989
<i>In fact, the skipper had already
rented his boat to be shot in Maeby's film.</i>

257
00:13:05,101 --> 00:13:08,229
<i>So neither he nor Gob were prepared...</i>

258
00:13:08,338 --> 00:13:11,671
<i>for the challenges of using cats to catch a seal.</i>

259
00:13:11,774 --> 00:13:15,767
God! It's like herding cats.

260
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:17,904
Here's your kitty cat. Aah! Fine!

261
00:13:18,014 --> 00:13:19,914
You don't get to be bait!

262
00:13:20,016 --> 00:13:21,984
Why are there cats in the shot?

263
00:13:22,085 --> 00:13:25,577
This is the camera boat.
Can you lose the- cats, please?

264
00:13:25,688 --> 00:13:27,588
Uncle Gob?

265
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:30,792
Maeby?

266
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:34,227
<i>And Michael traced the phone
number he found on the note to an address.</i>

267
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:37,390
Thank you, Mr. Parmesan. Okay.

268
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,436
In there is the father of the child
that Maggie wants me to help her raise.

269
00:13:41,538 --> 00:13:44,701
<i>And he probably doesn't know
that she's got another man involved.</i>

270
00:13:44,807 --> 00:13:47,640
So I want you to stay here
and enjoy the adventure from the car.

271
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:51,236
This one could get a little ugly.

272
00:13:51,347 --> 00:13:55,545
And, hey, I'd like to see that cop of Maggie's
do detective work this good. Huh?

273
00:13:57,987 --> 00:14:01,081
Oh, come on.
Is this your phone number?

274
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:04,455
Hey, I told you at the bar.
I left that on Maggie's door.

275
00:14:04,561 --> 00:14:06,722
And why are you hangin'
around Maggie's house, anyway?

276
00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:09,161
L- I'm sorry.
I'm in this crazy relationship.

277
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:12,234
She wants me to raise this child with her
because there's no father.

278
00:14:12,335 --> 00:14:14,303
- No father?
- I thought I'd come here-

279
00:14:14,404 --> 00:14:17,066
There's a father.
There's two fathers. David!

280
00:14:17,173 --> 00:14:20,973
<i>- I'm making gravy.
- That bitch is gonna keep our child.</i>

281
00:14:21,077 --> 00:14:24,843
I knew she was up to something.

282
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:27,508
<i>Hot cops
Hot</i>

283
00:14:30,634 --> 00:14:34,536
<i>Michael had tracked down the
couple who'd hired Maggie to carry their child.</i>

284
00:14:34,638 --> 00:14:38,165
<i>- So that's why you guys are staking out her house.
- She hasn't returned our calls.</i>

285
00:14:38,275 --> 00:14:40,937
<i>- There's something about her I just don't trust.
- I'll say.</i>

286
00:14:41,044 --> 00:14:43,410
She said she doesn't know
who the father is.

287
00:14:43,513 --> 00:14:46,607
<i>In a funny way, neither do we.
Wejust gave her a mixed cocktail.</i>

288
00:14:46,717 --> 00:14:48,617
- Two parts Taylor.
- Two parts Carter.

289
00:14:48,719 --> 00:14:50,619
And let her do her thing.

290
00:14:50,721 --> 00:14:53,884
<i>We decided we never want to know
which of us is the real father.</i>

291
00:14:56,593 --> 00:14:58,493
Well, why should you?

292
00:14:58,595 --> 00:15:01,758
I just hope you find out which one of you
can breast-feed.

293
00:15:01,865 --> 00:15:04,561
You know,
we're in a loving relationship.

294
00:15:04,668 --> 00:15:08,069
<i>Andjust because we don't have breasts
does not mean we cannot nourish our child.</i>

295
00:15:08,171 --> 00:15:10,071
<i>I'm sorry. I didn't mean to-</i>

296
00:15:10,173 --> 00:15:13,142
I don't want you guys to worry about
getting that child back from Maggie...

297
00:15:13,243 --> 00:15:15,473
because I'm gonna help you.

298
00:15:15,579 --> 00:15:17,638
Wow. What a... good guy.

299
00:15:17,748 --> 00:15:21,411
I know. And for once,
I'm one lie ahead of Maggie Lizer's lies.

300
00:15:21,518 --> 00:15:24,248
<i>In fact, Michael was one lie behind her.</i>

301
00:15:24,354 --> 00:15:28,882
<i>And what if I told you
that Loretta was not fat...</i>

302
00:15:28,992 --> 00:15:31,426
but actually a very greedy woman...

303
00:15:31,528 --> 00:15:34,588
in a very cheap fat suit?

304
00:15:34,698 --> 00:15:37,223
<i>What, do you think I'm kidding?
Huh?</i>

305
00:15:37,334 --> 00:15:40,303
- What are you doing?
- Okay, so she's fat.

306
00:15:40,404 --> 00:15:44,170
- Your Honor, this is an outrage!
- Wow. Did I lose this one.

307
00:15:44,274 --> 00:15:46,742
Mr. Zuckerkorn,
you've been warned about touching.

308
00:15:46,843 --> 00:15:50,176
- You said spanking.
- I want this case thrown out immediately.

309
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,010
<i>In fact, Loretta wasn't overweight-</i>

310
00:15:53,116 --> 00:15:56,745
- Oh, no! My water just broke!
- Quickly, Your Honor. Quickly throw it out.

311
00:15:56,853 --> 00:15:59,788
<i>but was carrying the child
that Maggie was supposed to.</i>

312
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:04,987
<i>You see, it was Loretta's urine that
Tobias and Lindsay ended up testing...</i>

313
00:16:05,095 --> 00:16:08,690
<i>a fact they missed when they were
making out in the shower.</i>

314
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:11,700
<i>And Maggie did buy the fat suit
to serve as her pregnancy belly.</i>

315
00:16:11,802 --> 00:16:13,702
All right, this is goin' back.

316
00:16:13,804 --> 00:16:18,537
<i>But soon upgraded
to a higher-quality latex model.</i>

317
00:16:18,642 --> 00:16:21,167
<i>It's time!</i>

318
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:24,475
<i>- Is there a doctor in the house?
- Oh, my God! My water broke too!</i>

319
00:16:24,581 --> 00:16:26,481
I'm in labor!

320
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:31,452
<i>Maggie wasn't, but had no choice
but to pretend to deliver at the same time.</i>

321
00:16:31,555 --> 00:16:34,683
<i>And Gob caught up with Maeby
and made a confession.</i>

322
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,952
I think I'm responsible
for Buster's hand.

323
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,824
Yeah, and I'm responsible for
an $80-million movie without an ending.

324
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:42,558
I know those problems seem big
when you're a kid, Maeby.

325
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:45,260
Look, this is kind of weird
advice for me to be giving...

326
00:16:45,368 --> 00:16:47,495
but why don't you
just tell him the truth?

327
00:16:47,604 --> 00:16:49,504
I mean, he'll respect you for it.

328
00:16:50,607 --> 00:16:53,132
Thanks, Maeby.

329
00:16:53,243 --> 00:16:56,076
Okay, now I'm just lying
for no reason.

330
00:16:58,281 --> 00:17:00,511
<i>And Michael arrived at the courthouse...</i>

331
00:17:00,617 --> 00:17:05,213
<i>only to discover that Maggie
had already been rushed to the hospital.</i>

332
00:17:05,322 --> 00:17:08,985
<i>And back at the penthouse, Lucille was
praying for the second time in her life.</i>

333
00:17:09,092 --> 00:17:11,526
Lord, let Buster forget everything.

334
00:17:11,628 --> 00:17:15,291
And if you need to take another hand
to make that happen...

335
00:17:15,398 --> 00:17:17,366
please make it Gob's.

336
00:17:17,467 --> 00:17:22,427
<i>It was at that exact moment
that Buster did forget he'd lost his hand.</i>

337
00:17:22,539 --> 00:17:24,598
Oh! No, stop it, stop it, stop it!

338
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:27,973
<i>Oh, you caught my tendon
in your claw!</i>

339
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:32,606
My claw? Aw, God!

340
00:17:32,716 --> 00:17:35,583
I'm a monster!

341
00:17:38,154 --> 00:17:42,887
No!

342
00:17:42,993 --> 00:17:45,894
Whose idea was the temporary hand?

343
00:17:45,996 --> 00:17:48,430
<i>Buster!</i>

344
00:17:48,532 --> 00:17:50,898
Hi. There's something
you need to know.

345
00:17:51,001 --> 00:17:54,061
There's nothing he needs to know.
Take his hand. Take it now!

346
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:56,400
It was my fault. It was my seal.

347
00:17:56,506 --> 00:17:59,100
I released him,
and he bit off your hand.

348
00:17:59,209 --> 00:18:01,734
Wow. Truth feels good.

349
00:18:01,845 --> 00:18:04,245
- You did this to me?
- Yeah.

350
00:18:04,347 --> 00:18:08,306
<i>And Gob was about to experience
something that didn't feel that good.</i>

351
00:18:08,418 --> 00:18:10,409
<i>No, Buster! Oh!</i>

352
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,387
<i>Michael, meanwhile, notified the
policemen that Maggie was in the hospital.</i>

353
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:16,118
- I will meet you there.
- We're on our way.

354
00:18:16,226 --> 00:18:18,126
I'm getting goose bumps.

355
00:18:18,228 --> 00:18:20,696
Hi. Okay.
I'm gonna go in there with Maggie.

356
00:18:20,797 --> 00:18:23,265
As far as I know, she's already
had the kid, okay?

357
00:18:23,366 --> 00:18:26,824
We're havin' some adventure though, huh?
You can't say we're not havin' fun.

358
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,240
Don't smoke, sonny.

359
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,273
Michael.
Oh, I'm glad you're here.

360
00:18:38,381 --> 00:18:43,751
<i>Is this our little bundle
of... two gay cops' baby?</i>

361
00:18:47,223 --> 00:18:50,124
<i>Shh, shh, shh, shh.
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.</i>

362
00:18:50,226 --> 00:18:52,319
Here it is.
This came from our cup.

363
00:18:52,429 --> 00:18:54,624
That fellow was in our cup once.

364
00:18:54,731 --> 00:18:57,131
Here's something I think
you both need to have.

365
00:18:59,069 --> 00:19:02,505
Boy, you just cannot get off
the breast thing, can you?

366
00:19:02,606 --> 00:19:05,973
Okay, where's the baby?

367
00:19:06,076 --> 00:19:09,603
- I'm not pregnant.
- But we paid you to do this, Maggie.

368
00:19:09,713 --> 00:19:12,477
I know, and I wanted to, but then
it turns out I couldn't get pregnant.

369
00:19:12,582 --> 00:19:16,382
And I had this client-You know,
we were working on the fat case.

370
00:19:16,486 --> 00:19:19,478
So l-
Hey, I outsourced it, okay?

371
00:19:19,589 --> 00:19:22,683
And you weren't gonna let
these nice guys have a baby?

372
00:19:22,792 --> 00:19:24,692
You were gonna have us raise it?

373
00:19:24,794 --> 00:19:26,694
Of course not.

374
00:19:26,796 --> 00:19:29,663
<i>I'm gonna give 'em their baby.
I never thought you'd stick around.</i>

375
00:19:29,766 --> 00:19:31,666
I'm not goin' anywhere, baby.

376
00:19:31,768 --> 00:19:34,202
What is wrong with me?

377
00:19:34,304 --> 00:19:37,034
<i>Oh! Here it comes!
Here comes the baby!</i>

378
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,005
<i>Is that the head?</i>

379
00:19:39,109 --> 00:19:43,375
<i>Loretta had her baby, and
the new family couldn't have been happier.</i>

380
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:47,280
<i>- And Michael reunited with his son.
- You disappointed?</i>

381
00:19:47,384 --> 00:19:50,649
You kiddin' me?
You're the only son I've ever needed.

382
00:19:50,754 --> 00:19:53,279
That's all the adventure I've ever needed.

383
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:57,884
Okay. Son, I'm going to meet you
at the car. "M." Main floor.

384
00:19:57,994 --> 00:19:59,894
<i>No adventure there.</i>

385
00:19:59,996 --> 00:20:02,863
<i>But "M"didn't stand for "main floor."</i>

386
00:20:05,135 --> 00:20:07,103
<i>Dr. Ward to the morgue, please.</i>

387
00:20:07,203 --> 00:20:09,831
<i>Dr. Ward to the morgue, please. Stat.</i>

388
00:20:09,939 --> 00:20:12,237
<i>And Michael said good-bye to Maggie.</i>

389
00:20:12,342 --> 00:20:14,606
- I know. I've got a problem.
- We obviously both do.

390
00:20:14,711 --> 00:20:19,239
We obviously both crave
some crazy complication in our lives.

391
00:20:19,349 --> 00:20:22,216
When we're together, it is like-

392
00:20:22,318 --> 00:20:24,582
- Magic?
- I was gonna say "train wreck."

393
00:20:24,688 --> 00:20:27,213
We have to make a vow, okay?
This is over.

394
00:20:27,323 --> 00:20:31,760
No more lying.
No deceit, no sex. Everything.

395
00:20:31,861 --> 00:20:35,353
No more lies.

396
00:20:35,465 --> 00:20:38,662
<i>But that, too, turned out to be a lie.</i>

397
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:56,644
<i>On the next
Arrested Development.</i>

398
00:20:56,753 --> 00:20:59,779
<i>Buster and Gob
find themselves closer than ever.</i>

399
00:20:59,889 --> 00:21:02,722
And there you are. We've removed the hook,
and there's been no damage.

400
00:21:02,826 --> 00:21:05,852
- Oh, thank God.
- Yeah, he's gonna be fine.

401
00:21:05,962 --> 00:21:09,557
But unfortunately,
you've still got a hook in your ass.

402
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:12,134
<i>And Maggie gets a big surprise.</i>

403
00:21:12,235 --> 00:21:15,329
<i>You have got to be kidding me.</i>

404
00:21:18,274 --> 00:21:20,708
<i>Hot cops
We'll clean up the town</i>

405
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:23,506
<i>We'll turn that old frown
upside down</i>

406
00:21:23,613 --> 00:21:26,138
<i>Hot cops
We're aiming to please</i>

407
00:21:26,249 --> 00:21:29,218
<i>You know we'll get down
on our knees</i>

408
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:31,947
<i>We're taking on the bad boys</i>

409
00:21:32,055 --> 00:21:34,683
<i>With our loaded guns</i>

410
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:37,692
<i>We'll pump you full
of molten lead</i>

411
00:21:37,794 --> 00:21:40,160
<i>Bang, bang, you're dead</i>

412
00:21:40,263 --> 00:21:42,527
<i>Hot cops</i>

413
00:21:42,632 --> 00:21:45,294
<i>Just give us a squeeze</i>

414
00:21:45,401 --> 00:21:48,199
<i>Hot cops
Hot</i>
