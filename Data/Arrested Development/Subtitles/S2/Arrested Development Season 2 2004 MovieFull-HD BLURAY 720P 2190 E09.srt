1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,921
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:04,023 --> 00:00:06,514
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:06,625 --> 00:00:08,616
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:14,166 --> 00:00:15,861
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

5
00:00:19,705 --> 00:00:23,698
<i>Michael Bluth was working
at home when his son made a curious request.</i>

6
00:00:23,809 --> 00:00:26,710
<i>Dad, would anyone miss this
Peter and the Wolf read-along record?</i>

7
00:00:26,812 --> 00:00:29,872
No. I think that's part of
the model home decorations. Why?

8
00:00:29,982 --> 00:00:34,146
You're right. My girlfriend Ann wants
to have a Christian music bonfire here.

9
00:00:34,253 --> 00:00:37,882
That sounds like some mild fun.
I think we've got some Christmas music.

10
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:42,051
Oh, no. It's not- It's not a "Christian music"
bonfire. It's a Christian "music bonfire."

11
00:00:42,161 --> 00:00:44,220
You know, we burn
all satanic music.

12
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:47,389
The thing is, though, the only music
I have is either instructional or humor.

13
00:00:47,499 --> 00:00:50,900
<i>He'd been particularly fond
of a CD of something called TheJerky Boys.</i>

14
00:00:51,003 --> 00:00:52,903
Hello.

15
00:00:53,005 --> 00:00:55,974
Hey, nitz. Hey, jerky.
I wanna buy a house, Dad.

16
00:00:56,075 --> 00:00:58,236
- It's gotta be big.
- You said "Dad," buddy.

17
00:00:58,343 --> 00:01:01,471
Shut up, jerky.

18
00:01:03,749 --> 00:01:06,775
<i>Hey, George Michael. Jesus called.
He wants your Thriller album.</i>

19
00:01:06,885 --> 00:01:09,581
<i>Yeah, I don't think the bonfire
is such a great idea.</i>

20
00:01:09,688 --> 00:01:11,918
I know it might be weird,
but Ann's my girlfriend...

21
00:01:12,024 --> 00:01:14,322
so I think I'll go
buy some albums today.

22
00:01:14,426 --> 00:01:16,917
Hey, can you cover for me
at the banana stand if l-

23
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,191
<i>- No.
- I'll cover for you, pal.</i>

24
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:22,927
It's been a long time since I've been down
at that banana stand.

25
00:01:23,035 --> 00:01:26,801
Oh, okay. Good. It's the only way
we're ever gonna get it air-conditioned.

26
00:01:26,905 --> 00:01:31,103
<i>Michael! How would you like
me to owe you a favor?</i>

27
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,838
I want you to bid on me at
the charity auction this year.

28
00:01:33,946 --> 00:01:36,380
Okay. Now I'd like to use up
my favor and decline.

29
00:01:36,482 --> 00:01:38,541
And isn't that Buster's annual job?

30
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:41,483
Yes, but I can't have
a replay of last year.

31
00:01:41,587 --> 00:01:45,045
<i>When Buster
inadvertently bid on Lucille 2.</i>

32
00:01:45,157 --> 00:01:48,058
- $10,000!
- Buster.

33
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,391
And you're embarrassed to have Oscar bid on you.

34
00:01:51,497 --> 00:01:53,624
With his two pair
of pants? You bet.

35
00:01:53,732 --> 00:01:57,293
Oh, hi, Mom.
I have the afternoon free.

36
00:01:57,402 --> 00:02:00,030
<i>Really? Did nothing cancel?</i>

37
00:02:00,139 --> 00:02:02,573
All right.
I need to borrow a fur.

38
00:02:02,674 --> 00:02:06,633
I thought you were antifur, Lindsay. Weren't
you protesting some hunter gun thing yesterday?

39
00:02:06,745 --> 00:02:08,804
I stopped by.
I hadn't chosen a side.

40
00:02:08,914 --> 00:02:11,144
...which follows all the rules.
- Murderers! You're all murderers!

41
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,016
<i>There are plenty of rules
about guns already on the books.
- Murderers!</i>

42
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,350
You're not allowed
to sell a gun to a kid.

43
00:02:17,456 --> 00:02:21,187
<i>- You're not even allowed
to fire your gun in the air-
- Is that Frank Wrench?</i>

44
00:02:21,293 --> 00:02:23,056
On the Fourth ofJuly.

45
00:02:23,162 --> 00:02:26,996
<i>In fact, it was People's Choice
nominated actor Moses Taylor...</i>

46
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:30,364
<i>famous for his portrayal
of the rule-abiding detective-</i>

47
00:02:30,469 --> 00:02:32,266
<i>- Stop sign.
- Frank Wrench...</i>

48
00:02:32,371 --> 00:02:35,670
<i>star of the television show Wrench.</i>

49
00:02:35,774 --> 00:02:38,106
<i>Well, that's one rule
I'm not gonna follow.</i>

50
00:02:40,012 --> 00:02:42,776
- Aah.
- That's the Second Amendment. Read it.

51
00:02:42,881 --> 00:02:44,849
What do you need
with one of Mom's furs?

52
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:47,510
- I'm cold.
- So am I.

53
00:02:47,619 --> 00:02:49,450
- No.
- All right, look.

54
00:02:49,555 --> 00:02:52,888
I met Moses Taylor. We're having
a date in the park tomorrow.

55
00:02:52,991 --> 00:02:56,449
Try to get him to bid on you at the auction
tomorrow, because Michael can't.

56
00:02:56,562 --> 00:02:58,462
He's bidding on Mother.

57
00:02:58,564 --> 00:03:02,864
Except that I'm not. Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go work in the banana stand.

58
00:03:02,968 --> 00:03:06,460
And I'm gonna see if I can get
a wrench to strip my nuts.

59
00:03:06,572 --> 00:03:09,234
I was trying to be sexy.

60
00:03:09,341 --> 00:03:11,309
It just got away from me.

61
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:16,541
<i>It's bachelorette season in Newport Beach,
and some lovely ladies are up for auction.</i>

62
00:03:16,648 --> 00:03:19,845
<i>Plus, another wolf sighting in the park.
What that means for your weekend-</i>

63
00:03:19,952 --> 00:03:21,852
Bad news, Michael.

64
00:03:21,954 --> 00:03:25,082
I'm afraid the Blue Man Group
and I have parted ways.

65
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:29,251
Seems I'm officially no longer
a standby understudy.

66
00:03:29,361 --> 00:03:33,161
- "Cease and desist."
- Seems they don't appreciate competition.

67
00:03:33,265 --> 00:03:35,733
<i>Tobias had recently taken out an ad...</i>

68
00:03:35,834 --> 00:03:38,302
<i>in a trade magazine
for a one-man show.</i>

69
00:03:38,403 --> 00:03:42,430
<i>And the worst part is Lindsay's out there
chasing some successful actor.</i>

70
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:45,009
Television's Frank Wrench.

71
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:48,841
I need to prove to her that I'm
not just a man, but a man's man.

72
00:03:48,947 --> 00:03:51,074
I think she knows that.

73
00:03:51,183 --> 00:03:54,744
Jesus! It's the wolf! That is
the wolf! The wolf is upstairs!

74
00:03:54,853 --> 00:03:57,185
<i>I think it's just my son's
Peter and the Wolf record.</i>

75
00:03:57,289 --> 00:03:59,917
I thought that was a Homefill.

76
00:04:00,025 --> 00:04:02,619
<i>Michael went
to check on his fugitive father...</i>

77
00:04:02,728 --> 00:04:05,196
<i>- who was living in the attic.
- You heard my call?</i>

78
00:04:05,297 --> 00:04:08,960
Have you been doing that all over town?
Because people think there's a wolf on the loose.

79
00:04:09,067 --> 00:04:12,093
Yes, there is a wolf on the
loose. His name is Oscar.

80
00:04:12,204 --> 00:04:16,436
Tell me he's not gonna be bidding on your
mother at that charity auction with my money.

81
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,509
Is that why you called me
up here, Dad?

82
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:21,374
Because you are a fugitive, and as far
as she knows, you're in another country.

83
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:25,280
It's driving me crazy.
They're parading in public.

84
00:04:25,384 --> 00:04:29,184
My back is-is- it's in knots.
I haven't had a massage since prison.

85
00:04:29,288 --> 00:04:31,188
Hope that was forced.

86
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:34,657
But then I found a way to fix my back
in this old catalog. Look at this hot tub.

87
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:38,218
I could use it for so many things.
It could be my, you know, water supply.

88
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:43,131
And those, uh, premade boil-in-bag meals-
You just toss those in there.

89
00:04:43,235 --> 00:04:45,294
- You're not getting a hot tub.
- Come on. Please!

90
00:04:45,404 --> 00:04:48,373
Dad, please. We can't afford that.
We're in this mess because of you.

91
00:04:48,473 --> 00:04:50,964
I'm working at the banana stand
just so we don't lose a shift.

92
00:04:51,076 --> 00:04:53,909
- But-
- We're done pampering ourselves in this family.

93
00:04:55,414 --> 00:04:58,645
Yeah, I would like the biggest
air-conditioner you've got.

94
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,877
No, no, not tomorrow.
I need-

95
00:05:00,986 --> 00:05:02,886
I need it today.
I'm not here tomorrow.

96
00:05:02,988 --> 00:05:05,980
<i>Just then, Michael ran into
a woman whom he hadn't seen in years.</i>

97
00:05:06,091 --> 00:05:09,424
- Michael?
- Sally Sitwell.

98
00:05:09,528 --> 00:05:12,554
<i>Michael had always
been in love with Sally Sitwell.</i>

99
00:05:12,664 --> 00:05:15,633
- We could steal a golf cart.
- No, they keep 'em locked up.

100
00:05:15,734 --> 00:05:18,828
- I know, 'cause I have a key.
- I'll go get my sweater.

101
00:05:18,937 --> 00:05:20,837
Oh, so you wanna use the key.

102
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:24,238
<i>But his father had
a longtime competition with her father.</i>

103
00:05:24,343 --> 00:05:27,335
It looks like my boy is gonna be
sticking it to your daughter, Sitwell.

104
00:05:27,446 --> 00:05:30,438
<i>Stick it to her.
Stick it to her.</i>

105
00:05:30,549 --> 00:05:32,517
<i>As a result,
Michael was awkward around her.</i>

106
00:05:32,617 --> 00:05:36,018
Should we go or... stick around?

107
00:05:36,121 --> 00:05:39,090
No, we're not gonna be sticking anything.
Not-Not gonna stick a thing.

108
00:05:39,191 --> 00:05:43,025
<i>Since then, he'd always been
eager to show her that he'd become a man.</i>

109
00:05:43,128 --> 00:05:47,087
- Are you still working here?
- No, no, no. Filling in for my son.

110
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,963
<i>Michael, and- Wow.</i>

111
00:05:50,068 --> 00:05:53,629
<i>- Sally Stickwell.
- Right.</i>

112
00:05:53,739 --> 00:05:56,299
Because the guys
wanted to stick it to me.

113
00:05:56,408 --> 00:05:58,205
- What? No.
- I never-

114
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,369
- Michael used to say that.
- No, I didn't.

115
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,572
- You said other stuff.
- I absolutely did not say that.

116
00:06:02,681 --> 00:06:05,479
- Man, he loved you.
- So, Gob, tell me-

117
00:06:05,584 --> 00:06:07,552
are you still doing
your little tricks?

118
00:06:07,652 --> 00:06:10,143
Do you consider this
to be a little trick?

119
00:06:10,255 --> 00:06:13,952
Oh. Did you just
squirt me with something?

120
00:06:14,059 --> 00:06:16,721
It's lighter fluid.
Didn't put in a new flint.

121
00:06:16,828 --> 00:06:20,730
<i>But still, where did
the lighter fluid come from?</i>

122
00:06:20,832 --> 00:06:25,269
- That's- great.
- Michael, maybe I'll see you over at the club.

123
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:28,168
<i>We never really took
that cart ride, did we?</i>

124
00:06:28,273 --> 00:06:31,640
And we never will,
'cause I'm not there.

125
00:06:31,743 --> 00:06:35,679
- Nor am I here. I mean, I'm here today.
- I'm gonna go.

126
00:06:35,781 --> 00:06:38,011
- Okay.
- Okay.

127
00:06:39,117 --> 00:06:41,585
Smooth, Michael...

128
00:06:41,686 --> 00:06:44,917
like her father's head,
chest, arms, legs and ass.

129
00:06:45,023 --> 00:06:48,117
- What are you talkin' about?
- He's hairless, Michael. It's a condition.

130
00:06:48,226 --> 00:06:51,354
I hate the guy, but at least he's got-
Satiny and smooth probably.

131
00:06:51,463 --> 00:06:53,363
I'm just different
than you, Gob.

132
00:06:53,465 --> 00:06:57,424
I'm not gonna siphon gas out of some girl's
car like you used to in high school...

133
00:06:57,536 --> 00:07:00,528
just so you can show up
and say, "Car troubles?"

134
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,335
It's called taking advantage.
It's what gets you ahead in life.

135
00:07:03,442 --> 00:07:06,536
Like you did with our biggest
shareholder, Lucille Austero.

136
00:07:06,645 --> 00:07:08,943
That was a one-time thing,
Michael. It's over.

137
00:07:09,047 --> 00:07:11,709
<i>It was far from over.</i>

138
00:07:11,817 --> 00:07:17,221
- Shall I put the Posturepedic in the down position?
- Elevate the knees this time.

139
00:07:17,322 --> 00:07:20,450
You just let Sally Sitwell slip away
right when she was ready to go.

140
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:22,527
- You were scared.
- What are you talking about?

141
00:07:22,627 --> 00:07:24,595
Come on.

142
00:07:24,696 --> 00:07:27,392
You gonna get off and do
your little dance too?

143
00:07:27,499 --> 00:07:30,957
No, l-I hurt my ankle yesterday
shooting hoops or something.

144
00:07:31,069 --> 00:07:34,129
Oh, God. My ankle.

145
00:07:34,239 --> 00:07:37,367
- Don't move. Let me-
- No, no, no. It's bad.

146
00:07:37,476 --> 00:07:39,706
<i>- Mother! Mother!
- Buster, it hurts.</i>

147
00:07:39,811 --> 00:07:43,303
<i>Michael decided
that perhaps he should go after Sally.</i>

148
00:07:43,415 --> 00:07:45,474
Have you seen
my other pair of pants?

149
00:07:45,584 --> 00:07:48,246
Lupe washed them, and they
sprouted. I threw them out.

150
00:07:48,353 --> 00:07:50,821
Well, that puts a lot
of pressure on this pair.

151
00:07:50,922 --> 00:07:53,982
<i>I think this one's good.
Looks like it would've put up a fight.</i>

152
00:07:54,092 --> 00:07:57,289
- I put up one to get it.
- As long as it gets Frank Wrench to bid on me.

153
00:07:57,395 --> 00:07:59,295
<i>- It won't.
- Hey, Mom.</i>

154
00:07:59,397 --> 00:08:01,695
I need to borrow
your country club card.

155
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,827
There's a friend I have that has lunch
there often I'd like to run into.

156
00:08:05,937 --> 00:08:07,734
Sounds like you're asking
for a favor.

157
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:11,969
- I know what that's gonna cost me.
I'm willing to bid on you.
- I'll give you the money.

158
00:08:12,077 --> 00:08:15,535
Start at five grand. If there are
other bidders, back off gracefully.

159
00:08:15,647 --> 00:08:21,108
Shout out, "I get her 364 days
a year for free!" or something.

160
00:08:21,219 --> 00:08:23,187
You're not gonna hear
that phrase.

161
00:08:23,288 --> 00:08:26,621
<i>Soon, Tobias came across
a flyer that promised to improve...</i>

162
00:08:26,725 --> 00:08:30,422
<i>both his masculine self-image
and his financial standing.</i>

163
00:08:30,529 --> 00:08:32,429
They're literally blue, not sad.

164
00:08:32,531 --> 00:08:36,023
<i>Meanwhile, Michael went to
have his accidental encounter with Sally...</i>

165
00:08:36,134 --> 00:08:39,194
<i>- but had forgotten about the
club's dress code for lunch.
- We have a dress code.</i>

166
00:08:40,705 --> 00:08:42,696
I can't wear this.
I look like I'm 16.

167
00:08:42,807 --> 00:08:44,297
<i>- Michael?
- Oh, no.</i>

168
00:08:44,409 --> 00:08:46,377
- Hello, Michael.
- Stan.

169
00:08:46,478 --> 00:08:49,811
- Hello, Sally.
- Hi. So, are you meeting someone here for lunch?

170
00:08:49,915 --> 00:08:53,043
No. I was going to, then they canceled.
So I'm gonna take off.

171
00:08:53,151 --> 00:08:56,609
<i>- No. Just join us, please.
- Michael knew he couldn't say no...</i>

172
00:08:56,721 --> 00:09:00,384
<i>- but he also knew he couldn't
flirt in front ofher father.
- Let's do it.</i>

173
00:09:00,492 --> 00:09:04,394
<i>And at another table,
Gob was being taken out to lunch.</i>

174
00:09:04,496 --> 00:09:06,396
Read me the appetizers again.

175
00:09:06,498 --> 00:09:10,491
Fried cheese with club sauce.

176
00:09:10,602 --> 00:09:15,403
Popcorn shrimp with club sauce.

177
00:09:15,507 --> 00:09:17,634
Chicken fingers-

178
00:09:17,742 --> 00:09:19,972
Oh, stop it.
You're making me dizzy.

179
00:09:20,078 --> 00:09:22,569
With spicy club sauce.

180
00:09:22,681 --> 00:09:24,979
No! I mean stop it.

181
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:27,449
- Gob?
- Michael.

182
00:09:27,552 --> 00:09:29,417
- Why don't you join us?
- Oh, no.

183
00:09:29,521 --> 00:09:33,150
- I'm just helping her eat.
- Oh, if you'd prefer privacy-

184
00:09:33,258 --> 00:09:37,194
<i>What? No. Are you kidding? I didn't even
wanna have lunch with her in the first place.</i>

185
00:09:37,295 --> 00:09:41,356
I just- or- I ju-

186
00:09:41,466 --> 00:09:44,765
<i>And so lunch continued
with both Bluth boys trying to prove...</i>

187
00:09:44,869 --> 00:09:48,498
<i>they weren't interested in the
women they were interested in.</i>

188
00:09:48,607 --> 00:09:52,441
When I saw those golf carts,
it kind of brought back some memories.

189
00:09:52,544 --> 00:09:54,774
Did you have too much club sauce
on your calamari?

190
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:58,042
<i>Gob, read me the desserts.</i>

191
00:09:58,149 --> 00:09:59,844
She p-

192
00:09:59,951 --> 00:10:02,317
probably forgot
her old lady glasses.

193
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,388
What is the matter
with you, Goby?

194
00:10:04,489 --> 00:10:07,185
<i>I'm happy to read to the lovely lady.</i>

195
00:10:07,292 --> 00:10:10,352
An assortment
of ice creams and sorbets.

196
00:10:10,462 --> 00:10:12,692
- You all right with him reading to your girl?
- Not my girl.

197
00:10:12,797 --> 00:10:14,856
- Huh?
- Why don't you read to your girl?

198
00:10:14,966 --> 00:10:17,264
Come on. I don't have
a girl. No, thanks.

199
00:10:17,369 --> 00:10:19,837
- Already taken care of. Thank you. Thanks.
- I'm sorry.

200
00:10:19,938 --> 00:10:22,839
Apparently there's been some
increased activity on your card.

201
00:10:22,941 --> 00:10:25,136
It's been declined.

202
00:10:25,243 --> 00:10:29,304
<i>In fact, the increased activity
on Michael's card was his father's.</i>

203
00:10:29,414 --> 00:10:31,905
You think a hot tub is the best thing
for someone with your condition?

204
00:10:32,017 --> 00:10:36,317
I can't see, but, uh, I didn't know
there was a doctor installing this.

205
00:10:36,421 --> 00:10:38,981
Somebody order a case
of Bag & Boil frozen dinners?

206
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:42,287
- I'm happy to get this.
- No, no. No, please, Stan. I'll do it. Um-

207
00:10:42,394 --> 00:10:44,885
Can you put this on my mother's card?

208
00:10:44,996 --> 00:10:47,863
Your mother? No. No, no, no.
She's a pool member only.

209
00:10:47,966 --> 00:10:50,161
<i>You'll excuse me
if my tone is not polite...</i>

210
00:10:50,268 --> 00:10:52,566
but this is more polite
than she has ever talked to me.

211
00:10:52,671 --> 00:10:57,005
<i>Michael had a feeling
why his credit card had been rejected.</i>

212
00:10:57,108 --> 00:11:00,202
What the hell did you do?

213
00:11:00,311 --> 00:11:03,007
I overdid it.

214
00:11:03,114 --> 00:11:05,947
Oh, it's so hot.

215
00:11:10,677 --> 00:11:14,909
<i>Michael's father had just
installed a hot tub in the attic.</i>

216
00:11:15,015 --> 00:11:18,007
- What happened to you?
- I tried to drink some of the water...

217
00:11:18,118 --> 00:11:20,848
and it was too hot,
and it tasted like soy sauce.

218
00:11:20,954 --> 00:11:24,822
<i>I think the teriyaki chicken burst.</i>

219
00:11:24,925 --> 00:11:28,053
That's why people typically don't cook
in these things or install them in attics.

220
00:11:28,162 --> 00:11:32,462
You gotta get it out of here,
Mikey. My eyes, they're burning.

221
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,693
<i>Wanna thank you for charging it
to my credit card.</i>

222
00:11:34,801 --> 00:11:37,031
You made me look very foolish
in front of Sally Sitwell.

223
00:11:37,137 --> 00:11:39,298
- Did you stick it to her?
- No, I didn't.

224
00:11:39,406 --> 00:11:42,136
You screwed that up, just like
you screwed up this hot tub.

225
00:11:42,242 --> 00:11:44,210
Is that veal Marsala
stuck in the intake?

226
00:11:44,311 --> 00:11:47,075
They all look so good
on the boxes.

227
00:11:47,181 --> 00:11:49,206
You know, it's good
you backed off Sally.

228
00:11:49,316 --> 00:11:54,845
<i>I don't need that guy saying his
daughter's sticking it to my loser son.</i>

229
00:11:54,955 --> 00:11:59,790
You know something? The reason I never went
after her is because you're always pushing me.

230
00:11:59,893 --> 00:12:03,693
<i>But now that I know that I don't have
your approval, l-I think that, uh...</i>

231
00:12:03,797 --> 00:12:06,595
I think that I'll
finally go for it.

232
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:11,569
<i>This isn't turning into
the party hangout I hoped.</i>

233
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,668
<i>- Hey.
- Hey, I thought I heard something before...</i>

234
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,767
like a wolf drowning
or something.

235
00:12:17,878 --> 00:12:20,244
I think that that was
maybe the house settling.

236
00:12:20,347 --> 00:12:22,815
Speaking of settling, how's Ann?
I mean, have you-

237
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:25,544
have you settled on an
artist's work to burn?

238
00:12:25,652 --> 00:12:27,711
- I was thinking Eminem for a while.
- Sure.

239
00:12:27,821 --> 00:12:30,312
But everyone is gonna be burning
Eminem. So, you know-

240
00:12:30,424 --> 00:12:33,757
And then I got this Pat Boone
album, but the guy is Christian.

241
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,488
But, you know, I don't know.
Somebody's gotta burn, right?

242
00:12:36,597 --> 00:12:39,828
- Well, I guess.
- Right.

243
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:46,571
- Hey.
- Oh, boy. I got some looks
on the bus 'cause of this.

244
00:12:46,673 --> 00:12:48,504
What are you doing
with that thing?

245
00:12:48,609 --> 00:12:52,067
I am going to catch that wolf, Michael. I'm
gonna shoot it with this tranquilizer gun...

246
00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:55,273
get the reward, and bid on my
woman at the charity auction.

247
00:12:55,382 --> 00:12:58,545
Isn't there some kind of a waiting period
for a rifle like that?

248
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:00,620
It turns out there is.

249
00:13:00,721 --> 00:13:03,121
Two weeks?
Isn't there a loophole?

250
00:13:03,223 --> 00:13:05,953
There is a gun show loophole.

251
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:09,825
What timing, huh? I mean, right
out back they were having one.

252
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:12,831
Gob, I'm going hunting
for my wife.

253
00:13:12,933 --> 00:13:15,265
<i>How lame was Lucille 2 at lunch, huh?</i>

254
00:13:15,369 --> 00:13:17,337
You've gotten attached, haven't you?

255
00:13:17,437 --> 00:13:19,632
You're not gonna tell
anybody about this, are you?

256
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,640
Come on. I'm not one to judge.

257
00:13:21,742 --> 00:13:24,802
Every time I've gone out with Sally,
I've looked like I'm 12 years old.

258
00:13:24,911 --> 00:13:27,709
But, yes, I probably will
tell people about this.

259
00:13:27,814 --> 00:13:32,308
Maybe we can strike up a deal. You keep
this to yourself, I help you get Sally.

260
00:13:32,419 --> 00:13:34,387
Siphon a little
something from her car...

261
00:13:34,488 --> 00:13:36,979
you show up in the Corvette,
looking like a man.

262
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:38,990
Car troubles?

263
00:13:39,092 --> 00:13:41,356
Probably shouldn't do the fireball
when you siphon the gas.

264
00:13:41,461 --> 00:13:44,794
I guess this flint's still got
a little life left in it, huh?

265
00:13:44,898 --> 00:13:48,561
<i>Lindsay, meanwhile, was waiting
in the park for her date with Moses Taylor.</i>

266
00:13:48,669 --> 00:13:51,194
<i>Sorry I'm late. Fans.</i>

267
00:13:51,305 --> 00:13:54,502
Sometimes it takes a while to jar their memories.

268
00:13:54,608 --> 00:13:59,409
Nice fur. You know, there are some nuts out
there who'd wanna throw red paint all over you.

269
00:13:59,513 --> 00:14:03,142
Wait a minute. I think
there's one right over there.

270
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:06,515
- Oh, my God. You're-
- Someone needs to read this.

271
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:09,589
<i>And that's when Lindsay's heel went out.</i>

272
00:14:13,927 --> 00:14:16,760
- I got him.
- False alarm.

273
00:14:19,032 --> 00:14:21,023
Crap.

274
00:14:24,338 --> 00:14:28,434
<i>- I'm being saved by Frank Wrench.
- No, you're not.</i>

275
00:14:28,542 --> 00:14:30,533
- Frank Wrench.
- Shut up.

276
00:14:30,644 --> 00:14:33,704
<i>But, unbeknownst
to Lindsay and Tobias-
- Oh, shoot.</i>

277
00:14:33,814 --> 00:14:37,113
<i>- Oh, great.
- the actor who played Frank Wrench
wasn't saving her...</i>

278
00:14:37,217 --> 00:14:39,583
<i>but was just trying
to distance himself...</i>

279
00:14:39,686 --> 00:14:43,622
<i>from the outlandish "Moses
Taylor Hunts People"scandal...</i>

280
00:14:43,724 --> 00:14:46,955
<i>that had been started
by a rabid anti-gun fanatic.</i>

281
00:14:50,831 --> 00:14:53,595
<i>And that night,
Michael went to help Sally...</i>

282
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,260
<i>with the car problems
Gob had created.</i>

283
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:59,339
What the hell?

284
00:14:59,439 --> 00:15:02,602
<i>Only to find out
things had gotten out ofhand for Gob.</i>

285
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:05,610
<i>Michael did look heroic as
he went to put out the fire.</i>

286
00:15:05,712 --> 00:15:08,909
<i>Unfortunately, Sally arrived
too late to see him that way.</i>

287
00:15:09,015 --> 00:15:10,915
God, what happened?

288
00:15:11,017 --> 00:15:14,783
Car trouble.

289
00:15:19,006 --> 00:15:21,474
<i>Gob had just blown up a car.</i>

290
00:15:21,575 --> 00:15:23,975
The next thing I know,
I'm running for my life.

291
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:27,570
And all I could think was, if something
were to ever happen to me...

292
00:15:27,681 --> 00:15:29,581
how sad I'd be, you know?

293
00:15:29,683 --> 00:15:33,449
What you did to me at lunch today-
You were ashamed to be with me.

294
00:15:33,554 --> 00:15:38,423
<i>No! I was ashamed to be seen
with you. I like being with you.</i>

295
00:15:38,526 --> 00:15:42,257
I'm sorry,
but you have no courage.

296
00:15:42,363 --> 00:15:44,661
How can you say that? Shh.

297
00:15:44,765 --> 00:15:49,099
I thought I heard my mom.
How can you say that?

298
00:15:49,203 --> 00:15:51,671
<i>- And on the other side of the wall-
- Michael?</i>

299
00:15:51,772 --> 00:15:53,899
<i>Lucille was finalizing
her plans for the evening.</i>

300
00:15:54,008 --> 00:15:55,908
You can bid up to 10,000.

301
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:58,706
The deal is off. You didn't
tell me it was a restricted membership.

302
00:15:58,813 --> 00:16:00,610
Find somebody else
to do your bidding.

303
00:16:00,714 --> 00:16:02,511
There is no one else.

304
00:16:02,616 --> 00:16:04,880
- Hi.
- Hi.

305
00:16:04,985 --> 00:16:07,647
- They said I could see you finally.
- Yes.

306
00:16:07,755 --> 00:16:11,282
God, I just feel awful
for whoever's car that was.

307
00:16:11,392 --> 00:16:14,691
Mm-hmm. I know it.

308
00:16:14,795 --> 00:16:18,856
Sally, I was thinking that maybe you
and I could-

309
00:16:18,966 --> 00:16:23,062
Don't try to talk. I have to run anyway.
I gotta do this charity auction thing.

310
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:27,698
<i>I'm sorry, sir. Your Blue Cross Blue Shield
was denied. We've called your mother.</i>

311
00:16:30,845 --> 00:16:34,474
I'll be back. I'll check
on you later. Feel better.

312
00:16:34,582 --> 00:16:38,279
Go out sometime.

313
00:16:38,385 --> 00:16:40,853
<i>Michael decided
to bid on her at the auction...</i>

314
00:16:40,955 --> 00:16:43,924
<i>and he knewjust where he
could get the money to do so.</i>

315
00:16:44,024 --> 00:16:47,187
Yeah. Start draining
the hot tub. It's going back.

316
00:16:47,294 --> 00:16:49,922
<i>And Lucille, with no other prospects...</i>

317
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:52,828
<i>turned to the son she least
expected to support her.</i>

318
00:16:52,933 --> 00:16:57,768
Gob, I don't suppose I could pay you
to bid on me at a charity auction.

319
00:16:57,872 --> 00:17:00,705
<i>And Gob was just
depressed enough to do so.</i>

320
00:17:00,808 --> 00:17:02,935
- Whatever you want.
- Oh, goody.

321
00:17:03,043 --> 00:17:05,511
<i>And finally, George Michael and Ann's...</i>

322
00:17:05,613 --> 00:17:08,241
<i>Christian music bonfire was under way.</i>

323
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:12,342
- Without ever going to the gym.
- I can't believe how many
people you told about this.

324
00:17:12,453 --> 00:17:15,718
Yeah, I hope I didn't confuse people
by saying it was a CD burning party.

325
00:17:15,823 --> 00:17:17,791
Great party!

326
00:17:17,892 --> 00:17:20,884
Maeby, I burned like 10 CD's
from somebody's MP3 player.

327
00:17:20,995 --> 00:17:22,895
This is a disaster.

328
00:17:22,997 --> 00:17:25,465
<i>Maybe you shouldjust try
listening to some of the music.</i>

329
00:17:25,566 --> 00:17:27,693
Yeah, some of the artists
are kind of talented.

330
00:17:27,801 --> 00:17:31,464
I don't know if you've heard ofThe
Jerky Boys. They do prank phone calls.

331
00:17:31,572 --> 00:17:35,201
It's kind of old school, but-
I have the tape in my room.

332
00:17:35,309 --> 00:17:37,800
I accidentally didn't burn it yet.

333
00:17:39,313 --> 00:17:41,781
<i>- Meanwhile, the auction began.
- Next up...</i>

334
00:17:41,882 --> 00:17:44,680
<i>we've got last year's
charity case, Lindsay Fünke.</i>

335
00:17:44,785 --> 00:17:47,253
<i>- Lindsay showed up-
- Oh, no. Not again.</i>

336
00:17:47,354 --> 00:17:50,323
<i>although she was still
feeling the effects of the tranquilizer.</i>

337
00:17:50,424 --> 00:17:53,825
- Hundred dollars, folks?
- Stick a wrench in me. I'm done.

338
00:17:53,928 --> 00:17:55,759
<i>- Anybody got 50?
- My wife is humiliated.</i>

339
00:17:55,863 --> 00:17:59,390
This is my chance to right
the small wrong that I did.

340
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:03,095
You shot her in the ass with about
four ounces of horse tranquilizer.

341
00:18:03,203 --> 00:18:06,001
<i>I haven't been the perfect husband.
Yes, I admit that.
- Twenty?</i>

342
00:18:06,106 --> 00:18:08,574
But now is my chance to be a hero.

343
00:18:08,676 --> 00:18:11,509
<i>- Please, Michael, give me some of your money.
- Ten?</i>

344
00:18:11,612 --> 00:18:14,581
<i>- Does anybody have 10?
- I've got $5,000, and I need that for Sally...</i>

345
00:18:14,682 --> 00:18:17,913
- but if you wanna make a low bid-
- Five thousand dollars.

346
00:18:18,018 --> 00:18:20,987
For that? Sold.

347
00:18:21,088 --> 00:18:23,249
I think you overpaid.

348
00:18:23,357 --> 00:18:25,655
<i>George Michael's
prospects were also improving...</i>

349
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:28,523
<i>- as the two made prank phone calls together.
- Let me try.</i>

350
00:18:29,563 --> 00:18:31,656
- Hey, rubberneck.
- Ann...

351
00:18:31,765 --> 00:18:35,030
could you and George Michael please
call someone else for a little while?

352
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:37,103
- He knows it was us.
- What?

353
00:18:44,078 --> 00:18:46,103
<i>We finally got a good
one comin'up.</i>

354
00:18:46,213 --> 00:18:49,774
Sally Sitwell. What do I hear?

355
00:18:49,883 --> 00:18:52,647
<i>- Five hundred dollars.
- You're not bidding? I was hoping you would.</i>

356
00:18:52,753 --> 00:18:54,618
<i>- Six hundred!
- You were?</i>

357
00:18:54,722 --> 00:18:56,417
You're a good kid.
You always have been.

358
00:18:56,523 --> 00:18:59,151
Not like that showboat of a father
of yours, if you don't mind me saying.

359
00:18:59,259 --> 00:19:01,989
<i>- Seven hundred!
- I've called him so much worse.</i>

360
00:19:02,096 --> 00:19:04,690
The truth is, sir,
I am interested...

361
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:07,289
but I don't have the money
to buy your daughter.

362
00:19:07,401 --> 00:19:11,030
<i>- You sure do drive a nice car.
- Eight hundred.</i>

363
00:19:11,138 --> 00:19:13,732
And I need one.
Mine got torched today.

364
00:19:13,841 --> 00:19:16,901
<i>One thousand!
Drop it off when you drop
my daughter off tonight.</i>

365
00:19:17,011 --> 00:19:20,811
<i>And finally, with
both the approval of Sally's father...</i>

366
00:19:20,914 --> 00:19:25,874
<i>and the lack of approval ofhis own,
Michael was ready to make his move.</i>

367
00:19:25,986 --> 00:19:29,217
<i>- 15,000.
- What?</i>

368
00:19:29,323 --> 00:19:31,314
- Wow.
- Yeah.

369
00:19:31,425 --> 00:19:33,655
I gotta tell ya.
This puts a lot of pressure on me.

370
00:19:33,761 --> 00:19:36,924
- It's for a good cause.
- I heard it was to reseed the greens.

371
00:19:37,031 --> 00:19:40,330
Gonna be a lot of shifts for you
at the banana stand, huh?

372
00:19:40,434 --> 00:19:43,232
I should be honest with you.
I don't have that much money...

373
00:19:43,337 --> 00:19:46,738
- and I sold the Corvette to cover it.
- That's quick. To who?

374
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,434
- Your father, as a matter of fact.
- My father?

375
00:19:49,543 --> 00:19:52,205
- Yeah.
- My father can't drive a convertible.

376
00:19:52,312 --> 00:19:54,337
Mind if I open it up?

377
00:19:56,316 --> 00:19:58,341
Wow!

378
00:19:58,452 --> 00:20:01,353
<i>- Got some pickup.
- This is just like him.</i>

379
00:20:01,455 --> 00:20:03,616
He always interferes
with everyone I date.

380
00:20:03,724 --> 00:20:06,921
Well, you can tell him
to give you your car back.

381
00:20:07,027 --> 00:20:10,929
- But I bought you.
- I'm sorry. I'm not like you.

382
00:20:11,031 --> 00:20:15,695
I'd almost rather date someone
my father doesn't approve of.

383
00:20:15,803 --> 00:20:18,601
Thanks anyway.

384
00:20:21,542 --> 00:20:25,876
That-That-That is like me.
That's exactly like me!

385
00:20:25,979 --> 00:20:29,005
<i>And soon it was time
for Gob to bid on his mother.</i>

386
00:20:29,116 --> 00:20:33,075
Not all bad. The only one bidding
on Lucille 2 is that hairless Sitwell.

387
00:20:33,187 --> 00:20:34,950
<i>Seven right there. Eight.</i>

388
00:20:35,055 --> 00:20:36,886
<i>- Sitwell's bidding on Lucille 2?
- Nine.</i>

389
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:40,517
First he fires me,
then he steals my-

390
00:20:40,627 --> 00:20:43,460
<i>- Going once-
- mother's best friend.</i>

391
00:20:43,564 --> 00:20:45,794
Going twice.
Nine going twice.

392
00:20:45,899 --> 00:20:49,096
- $10,000.
- Oh, how grand.

393
00:20:49,203 --> 00:20:53,401
<i>Sold. Up from $800
to $ 10,000.</i>

394
00:20:53,507 --> 00:20:56,499
<i>Wow. You guys really
want a new golf course.</i>

395
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:59,909
And all from nonmembers.

396
00:21:00,013 --> 00:21:02,743
<i>On the next Arrested Development.</i>

397
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:06,081
<i>George Sr. Shows up to bid on Lucille.</i>

398
00:21:06,186 --> 00:21:08,154
<i>But the sound ofhis wolf call...</i>

399
00:21:08,255 --> 00:21:10,951
<i>and the smell of chicken
teriyaki interfere.</i>

400
00:21:11,058 --> 00:21:12,958
No, no, no, no.

401
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,824
<i>No. Oh.
Oh. Oh, no.</i>
