1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:04,421
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:04,523 --> 00:00:06,514
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:06,625 --> 00:00:08,616
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:14,133 --> 00:00:15,862
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

5
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:21,771
<i>Michael was adjusting
to his new position as vice president...</i>

6
00:00:21,874 --> 00:00:24,434
<i>which meant doing the work of
the president, his brother Gob.</i>

7
00:00:24,543 --> 00:00:26,408
- Michael.
- Hey.

8
00:00:26,512 --> 00:00:29,640
<i>So, did you see the new Poof?</i>

9
00:00:31,016 --> 00:00:33,712
His name's Gary,
and we don't need any more lawsuits.

10
00:00:33,819 --> 00:00:36,982
No, I was talking about the magazine-
Wait. Gary's gay?

11
00:00:37,089 --> 00:00:39,887
- Yeah.
- Uh-oh. He's gonna think I was coming on to him.

12
00:00:39,992 --> 00:00:42,051
You've got a nice mouth.

13
00:00:42,161 --> 00:00:44,152
I'd kill for that ass.

14
00:00:44,263 --> 00:00:46,163
Okay, the chair's
not doing it now...

15
00:00:46,265 --> 00:00:49,098
but lately it's been giving out
as soon as I lean back.

16
00:00:49,201 --> 00:00:52,898
<i>Anyway, I was talking about Poof magazine,
the magazine for magicians.</i>

17
00:00:53,005 --> 00:00:56,634
This guy Tony Wonder bakes himself into
a loaf of bread and pops out of a giant sandwich...

18
00:00:56,742 --> 00:00:58,767
to feed the troops.

19
00:01:00,379 --> 00:01:01,812
I had that idea 10 months ago.

20
00:01:01,914 --> 00:01:03,779
- You had that idea?
- Well, basically.

21
00:01:03,882 --> 00:01:08,182
I was gonna boil myself alive into a chowder
and then be ladled into a giant cauldron...

22
00:01:08,287 --> 00:01:11,256
- to entertain and feed the firemen.
- That's pretty close.

23
00:01:11,356 --> 00:01:13,449
<i>I should be in this Poof!</i>

24
00:01:15,894 --> 00:01:19,193
- Michael Bluth.
- He found him. Ice found your father.

25
00:01:19,298 --> 00:01:21,129
<i>Michael recently
had hired a bounty hunter...</i>

26
00:01:21,233 --> 00:01:23,098
<i>to track down his fugitive father.</i>

27
00:01:23,202 --> 00:01:25,670
- Wh-Where?
- He's coming over here at 5:00 to tell us.

28
00:01:25,771 --> 00:01:27,671
But he wants to get paid first.

29
00:01:27,773 --> 00:01:30,105
Dad goes back to jail,
I can be cleared, I can be president again.

30
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:34,270
And I'm halfway to getting out of this office
and into a steaming bowl of soup.

31
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:35,710
- Everybody wins.
- Yeah.

32
00:01:35,814 --> 00:01:39,682
Oscar, close it. You look like
the window of a butcher shop.

33
00:01:39,785 --> 00:01:43,221
- Thank God I can finally get rid of him.
- I'll see you at 5:00, Mom.

34
00:01:43,322 --> 00:01:47,315
<i>Michael then headed down
to the frozen banana stand...</i>

35
00:01:47,426 --> 00:01:50,020
<i>where his son
was supposed to be working.</i>

36
00:01:50,129 --> 00:01:53,121
It just seems like every time we wanna
be together, your father comes along-

37
00:01:53,232 --> 00:01:55,996
Hey, guys. What's going on?
Why's the banana stand closed?

38
00:01:56,101 --> 00:01:59,229
Oh, Ann came to see me,
so I thought I'd take a little break.

39
00:01:59,338 --> 00:02:01,670
- Can we talk about this later?
- Sure. No problem.

40
00:02:01,773 --> 00:02:04,367
Just, let's keep the phone on.
Okay, pal? Great.

41
00:02:04,476 --> 00:02:06,376
Hey, you.

42
00:02:08,046 --> 00:02:11,538
See? That's a perfect example of
how your father's always interrup-

43
00:02:15,621 --> 00:02:18,522
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:18,624 --> 00:02:21,149
- Hello.
- Hey, buddy. They found your grandfather.

45
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,353
- That's what I wanted to tell you.
- That's great.

46
00:02:23,462 --> 00:02:26,488
<i>- I didn't wanna say that
when you were talking to Egg.
- I'm still talking with Ann.</i>

47
00:02:26,598 --> 00:02:30,261
Oh, she's still goin'? Listen,
I'll talk to you later. I'm very excited.

48
00:02:30,369 --> 00:02:32,337
That's good.

49
00:02:34,273 --> 00:02:37,208
I think we should break up.

50
00:02:39,344 --> 00:02:41,244
<i>The bounty hunter, meanwhile...</i>

51
00:02:41,346 --> 00:02:43,246
<i>was eager to impress
the family attorney.</i>

52
00:02:43,348 --> 00:02:45,213
I cannot believe
that you made these.

53
00:02:45,317 --> 00:02:49,185
<i>Indeed, Ice had always bounty-hunted
to support his first love-</i>

54
00:02:49,288 --> 00:02:51,586
<i>party-planning.</i>

55
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,124
<i>And Lindsay was still hoping
to score a date with him.</i>

56
00:02:54,226 --> 00:02:58,356
I don't suppose you'd be interested in
catering an affair with me.

57
00:02:58,463 --> 00:03:02,126
Well, when you get a full guest list,
let me know.

58
00:03:02,234 --> 00:03:04,634
Why can't I do this anymore?

59
00:03:04,736 --> 00:03:06,636
That's got to bother you,
huh, Dad?

60
00:03:06,738 --> 00:03:10,640
- I mean, she's flirting right in front of you.
- Hmm? Oh! No.

61
00:03:10,742 --> 00:03:16,009
I am surprised, though, that she's going
after somebody so similar to my own type.

62
00:03:16,114 --> 00:03:20,050
But I suppose we all do expose
our inner desires, don't we?

63
00:03:20,152 --> 00:03:22,052
I think you just did.

64
00:03:22,154 --> 00:03:24,054
No, I didn't.

65
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:27,485
Is there any way
I can divorce them?

66
00:03:27,593 --> 00:03:29,493
Oh, sure.
It's called emancipation.

67
00:03:29,595 --> 00:03:32,325
But you've got to prove that
you're living in an unstable environment.

68
00:03:32,431 --> 00:03:36,128
Both my parents are trying to have affairs.
Of course, they haven't succeeded yet.

69
00:03:36,235 --> 00:03:39,796
If they do, I could have you out of this house,
on the street, in a month.

70
00:03:39,905 --> 00:03:41,429
- Sweet!
- Mm-hmm.

71
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,509
<i>Soon, Michael arrived,
and Ice began his presentation.</i>

72
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:48,068
When word got out that he was
building houses for Saddam Hussein...

73
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,843
he escaped to Mexico where, as you know,
he was arrested and interred in a local prison.

74
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,577
Until he was killed by this guard.

75
00:03:53,685 --> 00:03:56,779
<i>Body was held for six days
within the prison walls when-</i>

76
00:03:56,888 --> 00:04:00,415
<i>- I'm sorry- he killed a guard?
- No, the guard killed him.</i>

77
00:04:00,525 --> 00:04:02,652
He's dead.
Buried in Mexico.

78
00:04:02,761 --> 00:04:07,198
Uh, h-hold on. How do we know this is true?

79
00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:10,757
Because I have here his dental records,
his death certificate...

80
00:04:10,869 --> 00:04:14,532
and a political cartoon
from a leading Mexican publication.

81
00:04:15,641 --> 00:04:17,836
<i>Okay, again, I'm a caterer...</i>

82
00:04:17,943 --> 00:04:23,108
so if you do have any family events-
weddings, wakes-

83
00:04:23,215 --> 00:04:25,445
I'll leave my card.

84
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,950
Is it true?

85
00:04:28,053 --> 00:04:30,021
Is he really gone?

86
00:04:31,256 --> 00:04:33,156
- Ow.
- Just checking.

87
00:04:33,258 --> 00:04:36,489
These are his teeth.
He had such perfect teeth.

88
00:04:36,595 --> 00:04:39,325
- It was that Glisten.
- He swore by that Glisten.

89
00:04:39,431 --> 00:04:43,299
"Who left the cap off my- Glisten?"

90
00:04:43,402 --> 00:04:45,302
<i>It's all hitting me now.</i>

91
00:04:45,404 --> 00:04:47,463
This is really happening.

92
00:04:48,907 --> 00:04:51,467
All this awful funeral stuff!

93
00:04:51,576 --> 00:04:53,476
<i>The will.
We have to get the will.</i>

94
00:04:53,578 --> 00:04:57,810
I don't know if enough time has passed.
I don't know what I'm saying.

95
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:00,282
Is it in your car, Barry?
I'm gonna throw up!

96
00:05:00,385 --> 00:05:02,216
Check the car, Barry.
I don't know what I'm saying!

97
00:05:02,321 --> 00:05:04,221
The will is not here.

98
00:05:04,323 --> 00:05:07,724
The will is at my office, next to
the hot plate with the frayed wires.

99
00:05:07,826 --> 00:05:09,726
I didn't, uh- It wasn't-

100
00:05:09,828 --> 00:05:12,729
<i>In fact, Barry had lost George Sr. 's will.</i>

101
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:16,528
How did I get here?
Oh, my God, Lucille. He is gone!

102
00:05:16,635 --> 00:05:18,432
We have to have a wake.

103
00:05:18,537 --> 00:05:21,506
<i>Maeby was upset,
but saw a chance to fix up her mother.</i>

104
00:05:21,606 --> 00:05:25,667
Maybe we could get Ice to cater it
or something- I don't know what I'm saying!

105
00:05:25,777 --> 00:05:29,144
- We don't even have a body.
- I will be my father's body.

106
00:05:29,948 --> 00:05:31,848
I'll be the one buried.

107
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:34,282
Because he loved magic
so very much.

108
00:05:34,386 --> 00:05:37,617
- I don't think Gob knows what he's saying.
- I know exactly what I'm saying.

109
00:05:37,723 --> 00:05:40,123
I will be buried in my father's place...

110
00:05:40,225 --> 00:05:43,717
<i>and then, one week later,
I will emerge from the grave...</i>

111
00:05:43,829 --> 00:05:46,195
in one of the greatest illusions ever!

112
00:05:46,298 --> 00:05:50,234
<i>- This about getting into Poof?
- I mean, how does that not get me a cover?</i>

113
00:05:50,335 --> 00:05:52,303
Buster!

114
00:05:52,404 --> 00:05:55,896
- We can't tell him about this!
- I think the boy's been lied to enough.

115
00:05:56,007 --> 00:05:58,373
You weren't here
for the parakeet, Oscar.

116
00:05:58,477 --> 00:06:01,241
<i>As a child, Buster had a beloved parakeet...</i>

117
00:06:01,346 --> 00:06:04,782
<i>who, after landing on their
housekeeper Rose's wig, flew away...</i>

118
00:06:04,883 --> 00:06:08,649
<i>when she took out the trash
and into a transformer.</i>

119
00:06:08,754 --> 00:06:12,281
<i>When Buster found out,
he destroyed the family's kitchen...</i>

120
00:06:12,391 --> 00:06:15,918
<i>believing this to be
where Rosa lived.</i>

121
00:06:17,896 --> 00:06:20,729
- Whoa.
- What are you doing home?

122
00:06:20,832 --> 00:06:23,562
The army had half a day.

123
00:06:23,668 --> 00:06:25,863
- Are you guys planning a party?
- Yes.

124
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:31,409
It's your father's birthday, which,
coincidentally, is... my birthday.

125
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:34,240
Because you're twins.

126
00:06:34,346 --> 00:06:36,473
Well, I've got some shopping to do.

127
00:06:36,581 --> 00:06:39,482
<i>George Michael,
meanwhile, had just been broken up with...</i>

128
00:06:39,584 --> 00:06:41,484
<i>by his first girlfriend...</i>

129
00:06:41,586 --> 00:06:43,713
<i>and was on his way home.</i>

130
00:06:48,026 --> 00:06:50,995
<i>- And he went to his father for comfort.
- Dad?</i>

131
00:06:53,899 --> 00:06:55,867
I've got some bad news.

132
00:06:57,035 --> 00:06:59,333
What? What?
Is Ann telling everyone?

133
00:06:59,438 --> 00:07:01,804
It's your grandfather.

134
00:07:01,907 --> 00:07:04,603
- Apparently, he's dead.
- Are you okay?

135
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:06,768
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

136
00:07:06,878 --> 00:07:09,438
Uh, I'm sorry.
What were you saying about Ann?

137
00:07:09,548 --> 00:07:12,449
<i>George Michael didn't want
to burden his father with his break-up.</i>

138
00:07:12,551 --> 00:07:16,385
Nothing. I just- I broke up with her.
It's no big deal.

139
00:07:16,488 --> 00:07:18,046
- Really?
- Yeah.

140
00:07:18,156 --> 00:07:21,125
- Are you okay?
- Me? I'm great.

141
00:07:21,226 --> 00:07:23,126
- Yeah?
- I'm great.

142
00:07:23,228 --> 00:07:25,628
Good. Yeah.
She wasn't for us.

143
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,391
No, she's- she's a great girl.

144
00:07:27,499 --> 00:07:30,491
- For those other guys.
- You think there are other guys?

145
00:07:30,602 --> 00:07:33,162
I don't know what I'm saying.
Come here.

146
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,140
Hey, Brother.

147
00:07:37,242 --> 00:07:39,142
- You wanted to see me?
- Buster, yeah.

148
00:07:39,244 --> 00:07:41,872
I need you to help me with
this illusion I'm working on.

149
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:44,073
Oh, for Dad's birthday.

150
00:07:44,182 --> 00:07:46,673
Yeah. For Dad's birthday.

151
00:07:46,785 --> 00:07:49,913
So, look, I'm gonna
get in this coffin.

152
00:07:50,021 --> 00:07:54,082
What I'm gonna need you to do
is to spin it around...

153
00:07:54,192 --> 00:07:58,060
to show everybody
that there's no trap door.

154
00:07:58,163 --> 00:08:01,155
<i>Then I'm gonna escape
out the trap door.</i>

155
00:08:01,266 --> 00:08:04,167
- Ooh!
- You close the trap door...

156
00:08:04,269 --> 00:08:07,500
<i>bring in the pallbearers
and bury an empty box.</i>

157
00:08:07,606 --> 00:08:10,166
<i>So it's a hoax.</i>

158
00:08:10,275 --> 00:08:13,176
But why are you doing a coffin trick
on Dad's birthday?

159
00:08:13,278 --> 00:08:15,007
Black humor.

160
00:08:15,113 --> 00:08:19,743
<i>Say, "Hey, Dad, look at you.
You're... a year older...</i>

161
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:23,787
and a year closer to death."

162
00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:27,188
Oh, yeah, I guess that's kinda funny.

163
00:08:27,292 --> 00:08:30,386
Okay, but you have to
do a favor for me.

164
00:08:30,495 --> 00:08:33,430
I'm not really in the army,
and I told Mom I was...

165
00:08:33,532 --> 00:08:36,433
but I can't go to a family event
without an army uniform.

166
00:08:36,535 --> 00:08:39,470
- Oh, yeah. I used to be a stripper.
- Strippers don't wear clothes.

167
00:08:39,571 --> 00:08:41,061
Not at the end of the show.

168
00:08:41,172 --> 00:08:44,198
You can wear stripper clothes
when you're not stripping?

169
00:08:45,577 --> 00:08:47,545
You tell me.

170
00:08:47,646 --> 00:08:51,309
<i>George Michael
went for a walk in the adjoining lot...</i>

171
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:53,884
<i>to grieve both losses in private...</i>

172
00:08:53,985 --> 00:08:57,421
<i>and he made
an interesting discovery.</i>

173
00:08:59,324 --> 00:09:02,487
- Pop-Pop?
- Hide me.

174
00:09:02,594 --> 00:09:05,791
Don't turn in Pop-Pop.
Help Pop-Pop.

175
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:14,442
<i>George Michael snuck his grandfather
into the attic and helped him clean up.</i>

176
00:09:14,553 --> 00:09:18,182
- Wow, they're perfect.
- Years of brushing with Glisten.

177
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:21,020
Listen, you can't
tell anybody I'm up here.

178
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:23,027
- You have to protect me.
- Yeah, I know.

179
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,222
- I just- I can't not tell my father.
- I'm your grandfather.

180
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:27,492
<i>- I went through hell to get here.
- He had.</i>

181
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,468
<i>After being arrested, he found a loophole
in the Mexican judicial system.</i>

182
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,538
I have, uh- I have money.

183
00:09:34,573 --> 00:09:36,973
<i>The Mexican authorities...</i>

184
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,976
<i>even attempted
to fake his funeral...</i>

185
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:42,241
<i>although it was
a less-than-perfect deception.</i>

186
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:46,182
Anyway, I was halfway down to Panama,
and I saw something in the local paper.

187
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:48,185
<i>What he saw was a story...</i>

188
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:51,188
<i>about his wife giving mouth-to-mouth
to a homeless man.</i>

189
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:54,521
<i>She was kissing his brother.</i>

190
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:03,233
Well, I understand what that feels like.
I was dumped today.

191
00:10:03,335 --> 00:10:07,897
I can't tell Dad how upset I am about it because
he'll think I should just be upset about you.

192
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:10,237
- He wouldn't be wrong.
- What?

193
00:10:10,342 --> 00:10:13,243
Seems like we're
going through the same thing.

194
00:10:13,345 --> 00:10:17,111
- Why don't we keep each other's secrets?
- Yeah, okay.

195
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:22,248
Listen, if you pass a mini-mart,
Pop-Pop gets a treat?

196
00:10:23,989 --> 00:10:26,184
<i>The next morning...</i>

197
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,419
<i>- Michael ran into his son
doing something suspicious.
- Morning!</i>

198
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:30,552
- Hi.
- Where are you goin' with that food?

199
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:34,690
I was just gonna eat some of my
grandfather's favorite foods in my room.

200
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,234
It's the form that my grief is taking.

201
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:39,270
Okay.

202
00:10:42,841 --> 00:10:45,742
<i>I think George Michael's
hiding Ann in the attic.</i>

203
00:10:45,844 --> 00:10:47,744
From who, the Nazis?

204
00:10:47,846 --> 00:10:50,542
<i>No, his girlfriend, from me.</i>

205
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:53,083
I just caught him
sneaking up to her in the attic...

206
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:56,279
and he clearly did so
because he thinks I don't approve.

207
00:10:56,388 --> 00:10:59,289
I think I'm gonna
invite her to the wake.

208
00:10:59,391 --> 00:11:02,121
Why make him hide? Why do to him what-

209
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:05,789
Why do to him
what Dad used to do to me?

210
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:08,799
He was so amazing.

211
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:11,802
<i>That was actually an example
of how not so amazing he was.</i>

212
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:14,134
You're really going
through something here, huh?

213
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,969
I know!

214
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:18,976
You know, it's funny-
all those years when I pretended to cry...

215
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:21,979
I used to use Dad's death
to get me going.

216
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:25,482
I tried it with Mom's, but I'd
just end up smiling and ruining it.

217
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:27,575
But it feels, like, real.
You know?

218
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:30,917
And you haven't really allowed yourself
to grieve much at all, Michael.

219
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:34,925
My relationship with Dad was much more-
much more complicated than yours.

220
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:40,021
It was predicated a lot on secrets and lies.
There wasn't a lot of trust there.

221
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:41,861
<i>Here he comes.</i>

222
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:43,935
Here comes John Wayne.

223
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:48,534
I'm not gonna cry about my pa.

224
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:51,542
I'm gonna build an airport,
put my name on it.

225
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:55,637
Why, Michael?
So you can fly away from your feelings?

226
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:59,445
<i>You can keep 'em bottled up,
but they will come out, Michael.</i>

227
00:11:59,551 --> 00:12:02,952
Sometimes in the most unexpected-

228
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:06,286
Hey, where the-
Are my hard-boiled eggs?

229
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,794
<i>Meanwhile, Gob was preparing
for the illusion ofbeing buried alive.</i>

230
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,806
Boy, you sure
got this hole dug out quick.

231
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,809
<i>In fact, the laborer had been hired
by George Sr. Three days earlier...</i>

232
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,879
<i>for the same hole.</i>

233
00:12:29,481 --> 00:12:32,314
<i>And Buster searched
for the perfect card.</i>

234
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:36,081
"Someone wanted to send you
a birthday greeting. See you soon!"

235
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:39,157
Oh! That is wicked.

236
00:12:41,593 --> 00:12:44,494
<i>And soon, the wake
that Ice had catered began.</i>

237
00:12:44,596 --> 00:12:48,862
- What are you doing? Is this what you're wearing?
- My father's dead, Maeby.

238
00:12:48,967 --> 00:12:51,868
Yeah, but you're not,
and Ice is right there.

239
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:55,098
<i>Maeby knew that if she
could get her mother to have an affair...</i>

240
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:57,107
<i>she could emancipate.</i>

241
00:12:57,209 --> 00:13:01,339
All Pop-Pop ever wanted was to see you
with another man besides Daddy.

242
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,347
You're right.

243
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,349
You know what?

244
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:09,114
I'm gonna throw on a skirt, take off my
underwear and make your Pop-Pop proud.

245
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:12,054
Let me ask Barry.
That might be enough right there.

246
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,660
Is Oscar wearing my suit?

247
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:18,662
Hey-

248
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:21,927
You tell my brother
you don't wear a dead man's pants.

249
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:25,265
Shame on him. And you say that to him.
You say, "Shame on you."

250
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:28,306
- Okay.
- Say it to me like you're gonna say it to him.

251
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:30,807
I'm probably not
gonna say it to him.

252
00:13:30,909 --> 00:13:32,809
Okay.

253
00:13:32,911 --> 00:13:35,641
Look at her down there.
Does she look sad to you?

254
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:37,648
- Oh, my God. That's Ann.
- Who?

255
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,150
It's the girl
who ripped my heart out...

256
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:43,483
the girl whose face
will always be etched in my mind.

257
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,557
Her?

258
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:49,159
She's really funny.

259
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:51,821
Well, let's hope so.

260
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:53,557
<i>Don't forget the chicken wings!</i>

261
00:13:53,665 --> 00:13:56,634
Hey! Ann!
You're here. That's great.

262
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:59,795
- I wasn't sure whether you got my message.
- It wasn't a message.

263
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:02,840
- We talked.
- Uh, Ann?

264
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:05,810
Did Dad invite you?

265
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:10,075
I figured life's too short. You two care for
each other. Why throw that away? Huh?

266
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:13,049
Huh? Okay.

267
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:18,181
- Do you think we really do?
- A father can tell. Okay?

268
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:21,316
It's as Ann as the nose on Plain's face.

269
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:23,327
<i>And Buster arrived...</i>

270
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,989
<i>dressed in the military outfit
Gob had procured for him.</i>

271
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:28,896
- What the hell are you wearing?
- It's all regulation, Michael.

272
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:31,603
To get the top right,
the pants had to be a little snug.

273
00:14:31,603 --> 00:14:32,797
To get the top right,
the pants had to be a little snug.

274
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:35,465
Is there a birthday gift pile?
Hmm?

275
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:37,474
A birthday gift pile?

276
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:40,943
<i>Michael recalled what Buster
did to what he thought was Rose's car...</i>

277
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:44,675
<i>with what he thought
was Rose's favorite toy.</i>

278
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:46,683
<i>Hey!</i>

279
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:51,051
- Yours is the first.
- And the most wicked.

280
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:54,319
Get him out of here.
We can't let him know it's a wake.

281
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:56,326
<i>Buster!</i>

282
00:14:56,428 --> 00:15:00,865
Let's go get that coffin ready to be buried.

283
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:04,026
<i>And so the family
gathered to remember George Sr.</i>

284
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:07,731
<i>If anyone would
like to say anything about Dad...</i>

285
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,808
now's the time.

286
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:15,303
- Anyone.
- Anyone?

287
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:19,441
Perhaps my son George Michael
would like to say something.

288
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,418
Huh? Wanna share
your feelings? Eh?

289
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:25,684
- It's okay to cry, pal. It's okay.
- Yeah?

290
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,692
Wow.
He's really gone.

291
00:15:30,028 --> 00:15:34,795
<i>But I think that ifhe
was here right now...</i>

292
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,859
I would probably tell him
that it all worked out...

293
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:41,872
<i>and that, um...</i>

294
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:45,410
I'll be bringing you
some salmon rolls right away...

295
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:48,207
in... heaven.

296
00:15:48,313 --> 00:15:51,578
How many times
I gotta tell this kid chicken wings?

297
00:15:51,683 --> 00:15:54,948
<i>Lindsay got up to speak
in an outfit her daughter had chosen.</i>

298
00:15:55,053 --> 00:15:57,578
My father meant the world to me.

299
00:15:57,689 --> 00:16:00,590
Wipe, Mom. Give it a wipe.

300
00:16:00,692 --> 00:16:02,455
That's a home run.

301
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:05,462
<i>And finally, Michael got up to speak.</i>

302
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:08,465
I had a very complicated relationship
with my father.

303
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:14,061
Ice, can we- can we just cool it
on the smoothies for right now?

304
00:16:14,172 --> 00:16:16,436
There are smoothies?

305
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:18,442
I could never trust my father.

306
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:21,707
But I always want my son
to be able to trust me...

307
00:16:21,813 --> 00:16:24,373
so from now on...

308
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:27,043
we're always gonna be
honest with each other.

309
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,711
Okay?

310
00:16:29,821 --> 00:16:34,781
'Cause there's nobody I love
more than you in this whole world.

311
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:40,662
Michael, listen, can we
move the eulogy outside...

312
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:44,497
so I can time being lowered into
Dad's grave with your big finish?

313
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:47,128
- I'm done.
- Wow. That was your eulogy?

314
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:49,639
Glad Dad wasn't around
to see that.

315
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:53,476
- That was great.
- Well, I meant it.

316
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:56,980
So no more secret trips
up to the attic. Right?

317
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:59,482
<i>George Michael
didn't want to betray his grandfather...</i>

318
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:02,452
<i>but it appeared his father
already knew the truth.</i>

319
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:05,648
- I have Pop-Pop in the attic.
- What?

320
00:17:05,757 --> 00:17:08,783
The mere fact that you call making love
"pop-pop" tells me you're not ready.

321
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:11,362
<i>Hey!
Before we lose the sun!</i>

322
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:13,431
Come on.

323
00:17:15,005 --> 00:17:18,202
The speeches we heard today
are nothing more than words.

324
00:17:18,308 --> 00:17:21,277
<i>But I will prove that I love my father
more than anybody.</i>

325
00:17:27,351 --> 00:17:29,581
Buster!

326
00:17:35,959 --> 00:17:39,053
Stop it!

327
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,700
As you can see,
this is a normal coffin.

328
00:17:49,006 --> 00:17:50,974
Take me halfway around.

329
00:17:57,114 --> 00:17:59,582
I will become my dead father's body...

330
00:17:59,683 --> 00:18:02,413
<i>as I am lowered into his grave.</i>

331
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:04,749
- All right. Spin it back around.
- Dead father?

332
00:18:04,855 --> 00:18:06,755
Is he de- Dad's dead?

333
00:18:06,857 --> 00:18:09,917
Just keep it together, Buster,
and spin this back around.

334
00:18:10,027 --> 00:18:12,495
Oh, my God!
The card! The card!

335
00:18:15,699 --> 00:18:17,929
<i>Something's gone wrong.</i>

336
00:18:19,703 --> 00:18:22,137
<i>How about that?</i>

337
00:18:25,509 --> 00:18:27,602
<i>Michael noticed something in the dirt.</i>

338
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:29,906
Glisten.

339
00:18:30,013 --> 00:18:34,950
<i>And suddenly he realized what his son meant
when he said he had Pop-Pop in the attic.</i>

340
00:18:35,052 --> 00:18:37,350
Dad? Dad.

341
00:18:40,023 --> 00:18:43,083
How you doin', Michael?

342
00:18:43,193 --> 00:18:47,254
Uh, hey, but your father's alive, Michael.
He's alive.

343
00:18:47,364 --> 00:18:50,299
- How could you do this to us?
- I had no choice.

344
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,301
My brother is with Lucille.
She's destroying the family.

345
00:18:53,403 --> 00:18:57,464
You put the entire business in peril, you escape
from prison, then make us think you've died?

346
00:18:57,574 --> 00:19:01,032
L-l-I'm an innocent man,
Michael. I'm a patsy.

347
00:19:01,144 --> 00:19:04,341
<i>L- I signed some documents-
I thought they were gonna kill me.</i>

348
00:19:04,448 --> 00:19:07,349
Don't turn me in. Okay?
Can you help me out?

349
00:19:07,451 --> 00:19:10,352
<i>And for a moment
Michael was conflicted.</i>

350
00:19:10,454 --> 00:19:13,355
Well, I'm not gonna let you stay here
and make my son an accomplice. Okay?

351
00:19:13,457 --> 00:19:16,324
I'm sorry. I'm not gonna let you
spread your guilt to him.

352
00:19:16,426 --> 00:19:20,556
Ice, my mother
has something to tell you.

353
00:19:20,664 --> 00:19:24,191
- I find you very attractive.
- She cleans up nice too. Trust me.

354
00:19:24,301 --> 00:19:27,168
Uh, I think I'm finally off the clock.

355
00:19:28,538 --> 00:19:30,438
I'm out of here, right?

356
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:33,407
Hi. Dad's alive.
He's hiding in the attic.

357
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:36,308
- He's upstairs?
- Oh, my God!

358
00:19:36,413 --> 00:19:39,382
<i>Dad?</i>

359
00:19:44,187 --> 00:19:46,087
He's gone.

360
00:19:46,189 --> 00:19:49,158
Stack the chafing dishes outside
by the mailbox. I'm on the job.

361
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,996
I can't seem to give this away.

362
00:19:54,097 --> 00:19:56,429
<i>I can't believe it!
And I just found the will!</i>

363
00:19:56,533 --> 00:19:59,730
<i>Can someone
explain to me what's going on?</i>

364
00:20:05,475 --> 00:20:07,602
<i>Thanks, Mikey.</i>

365
00:20:07,711 --> 00:20:10,612
Yeah.
Well, now it's our secret.

366
00:20:12,616 --> 00:20:15,380
<i>And Michael met up
with his son, their roles now reversed.</i>

367
00:20:15,485 --> 00:20:19,114
I'm sorry. From now on
we'll just tell the truth to each other.

368
00:20:20,524 --> 00:20:22,424
- We're gonna try.
- Yeah.

369
00:20:22,526 --> 00:20:25,427
So, wait, obviously
Ann wasn't in the attic.

370
00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:29,090
- So you actually did break up with her?
- She broke up with me.

371
00:20:29,199 --> 00:20:33,397
The great thing is, she was so moved by what
you said tonight that we're back together.

372
00:20:33,503 --> 00:20:35,733
- Ah!
- Yeah!

373
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:38,034
Oh, is that great.

374
00:20:38,141 --> 00:20:41,338
Well, we're family,
and we stick together, huh?

375
00:20:41,445 --> 00:20:43,640
Hmm.

376
00:20:43,747 --> 00:20:47,444
Okay, let's go dig up your uncle.

377
00:20:48,985 --> 00:20:50,816
<i>On the next Arrested Development...</i>

378
00:20:50,921 --> 00:20:54,084
<i>Buster finds out about
the death of Captain Kangaroo.</i>

379
00:20:57,427 --> 00:20:59,759
<i>Michael grows weary
of caring for his father.</i>

380
00:20:59,863 --> 00:21:03,822
No, Pop-Pop does not get a treat.
I just brought you a- pizza.

381
00:21:05,435 --> 00:21:08,768
<i>And Gob finally makes
the cover of Poof magazine.</i>
