1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:04,421
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:04,523 --> 00:00:06,514
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:06,625 --> 00:00:08,616
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:14,133 --> 00:00:15,794
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

5
00:00:18,737 --> 00:00:20,637
<i>It was Monday morning...</i>

6
00:00:20,739 --> 00:00:22,934
<i>and Michael Bluth
was nervous about meeting...</i>

7
00:00:23,042 --> 00:00:25,476
<i>with the new prosecutor
ofhis father's criminal case.</i>

8
00:00:25,577 --> 00:00:27,772
I don't know what you're
so nervous about, Michael.

9
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,007
It's a new prosecutor.
It's a whole new beginning...

10
00:00:30,115 --> 00:00:33,607
a new day, a new case,
a whole new set of lies.

11
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:36,415
<i>- I'm not lying anymore, Mom.
- Michael was lying.</i>

12
00:00:36,522 --> 00:00:38,513
<i>He found his fugitive father
earlier in the week...</i>

13
00:00:38,624 --> 00:00:40,524
<i>and he was hiding him
in the attic...</i>

14
00:00:40,626 --> 00:00:43,459
<i>where George Sr. Was currently
waiting for his breakfast.</i>

15
00:00:43,562 --> 00:00:45,723
About the business,
just for the record...

16
00:00:45,831 --> 00:00:48,391
I was not involved with Dad
building houses in Iraq.

17
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,128
- That's exactly what I'm gonna tell them.
- Is that for Lindsay?

18
00:00:51,236 --> 00:00:53,397
<i>Because she's not scared
to eat in front of me anymore.</i>

19
00:00:53,505 --> 00:00:55,405
<i>Those are
the whites only, yes?</i>

20
00:00:55,507 --> 00:00:58,169
These aren't for Lindsay.
These are mine.

21
00:00:58,277 --> 00:01:00,177
Anyway, I'm not lying
anymore either, Michael.

22
00:01:00,279 --> 00:01:03,180
I'm being lied...

23
00:01:03,282 --> 00:01:05,182
on.

24
00:01:05,284 --> 00:01:07,309
Wow. Now more's gonna
come up than go down.

25
00:01:10,289 --> 00:01:12,189
I gotta get outta here.

26
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:14,350
<i>- Hmm?
- I can't take this anymore.</i>

27
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,726
I mean, she's just
so loving and affectionate.

28
00:01:18,831 --> 00:01:21,026
L- l-This is not the woman
I fell in love with.

29
00:01:21,133 --> 00:01:23,260
Oscar, please. You can't go.
You gotta stay, okay?

30
00:01:23,368 --> 00:01:26,303
This is the nicest she's been since
she found out Rosa could breast-feed Buster.

31
00:01:26,405 --> 00:01:29,772
Oh, Buster. Don't even bring that up.
He's well into his army training.

32
00:01:29,875 --> 00:01:33,174
<i>Actually, Buster had
hit a wall in his army training.</i>

33
00:01:33,278 --> 00:01:36,372
I can't do it! I can't make my bed,
and I can't do this either!

34
00:01:36,482 --> 00:01:40,646
Aren't you supposed to yell at me and call me
"homo" and motivate me over this wall?

35
00:01:40,752 --> 00:01:42,879
We can't do that anymore. Lawsuit.

36
00:01:42,988 --> 00:01:45,320
<i>In fact, it was a recent ruling...</i>

37
00:01:45,424 --> 00:01:48,621
<i>prosecuted by the same man
who Michael was soon to meet with.</i>

38
00:01:48,727 --> 00:01:51,525
It's going to be a long time
before Sergeant Wendell Baker...

39
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,121
calls someone
"Private Homo" again.

40
00:01:54,233 --> 00:01:56,292
God willing,
he'll fail boot camp.

41
00:01:56,401 --> 00:01:58,835
Well, why wouldn't he?
He already failed day camp.

42
00:01:58,937 --> 00:02:01,462
- Hey.
- Hi. Hey, Dad.

43
00:02:01,573 --> 00:02:04,508
<i>- You ready for the prosecutor?
- Hi. I hope so.</i>

44
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:07,170
- How'd that math test work out?
- Oh, it was okay, I guess.

45
00:02:07,279 --> 00:02:09,645
But- I don't know.
It was weird. I studied with Ann...

46
00:02:09,748 --> 00:02:11,648
but I still got a B-minus.

47
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:15,982
- Ann got you a B-minus?
- Well, it wasn't Ann. She's an expert in math.

48
00:02:16,088 --> 00:02:18,818
- Isn't that cute?
- Is it?

49
00:02:18,924 --> 00:02:21,085
<i>Michael felt his son
was setting the bar too low...</i>

50
00:02:21,193 --> 00:02:23,491
<i>with his dating standards.</i>

51
00:02:23,595 --> 00:02:29,033
No, it wasn't Ann's fault. I think I just
ended up thinkin' about the questions too long.

52
00:02:29,134 --> 00:02:31,728
And so, by the time I put
an answer down, I went with, like...

53
00:02:31,837 --> 00:02:33,737
my fifth choice
or somethin' like that.

54
00:02:33,839 --> 00:02:36,000
George Michael,
never settle for fifth choice.

55
00:02:36,108 --> 00:02:39,168
Something better is gonna come along.
She just has to.

56
00:02:39,278 --> 00:02:42,008
I think maybe sitting in the back
of the class with Ann is a bad idea.

57
00:02:42,114 --> 00:02:44,446
You know,
she's just so pretty.

58
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,916
- I get distracted, I guess.
- Do you?

59
00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:50,580
- I wish I could draw her nose.
- Maybe it's your eyes.

60
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:54,117
Maybe you need glasses...
for your grades.

61
00:02:54,226 --> 00:02:56,126
Didn't you say you had
a hard time readin' the board...

62
00:02:56,228 --> 00:02:58,753
- sittin' in the back row?
- No, I said I was in the back of the classroom.

63
00:02:58,864 --> 00:03:00,764
- That's what I mean. Yeah?
- It's different. No. No.

64
00:03:00,866 --> 00:03:03,460
Well, I don't know. Maybe.

65
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:05,537
- No, definitely. I'll call the eye doctor.
- I guess.

66
00:03:05,637 --> 00:03:07,935
I'm gonna set you up
an appointment. Okay?

67
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,235
<i>- Hey, gang.
- Tobias.</i>

68
00:03:10,342 --> 00:03:12,936
Oh. Ooh, I'm afraid I'll have to
take them to go. I'm late for the gym.

69
00:03:13,045 --> 00:03:14,945
Oh, and also,
here's a number...

70
00:03:15,047 --> 00:03:18,073
in case the Blue Man Group
calls and needs an understudy.

71
00:03:18,183 --> 00:03:20,981
I just found out
that my cellular telephone was a lemon.

72
00:03:21,086 --> 00:03:23,316
- It didn't work.
- Neither do you.

73
00:03:23,422 --> 00:03:26,482
<i>Pretty brave card for you to play.</i>

74
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:29,060
I just can't stand it. Tobias getting in shape...

75
00:03:29,161 --> 00:03:31,061
For a bunch
of slutty gym rats.

76
00:03:31,163 --> 00:03:33,791
- What's wrong with your voice?
- Nothing. I've been going out.

77
00:03:33,899 --> 00:03:36,333
<i>Lindsay had been frequenting singles clubs...</i>

78
00:03:36,435 --> 00:03:38,733
<i>also still hoping to make
her open marriage work-</i>

79
00:03:38,837 --> 00:03:41,431
<i>- Whoo!
- which it won't.</i>

80
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,304
- I didn't catch that.
- Whoo!

81
00:03:47,846 --> 00:03:50,280
I wonder how many women
he's slept with, if any.

82
00:03:50,382 --> 00:03:52,282
Lindsay, it's not
a competition.

83
00:03:52,384 --> 00:03:55,080
Of course it is, Michael.
That's why they call it scoring.

84
00:03:55,187 --> 00:03:58,588
- Maybe in the '70s.
- That many? We've only
been doing this for a month.

85
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:01,090
Instead of competing with Tobias,
why don't you try spending...

86
00:04:01,193 --> 00:04:03,627
- a little more time with your daughter?
- Why? Tobias doing that?

87
00:04:03,729 --> 00:04:06,095
<i>At that moment, Lindsay's daughter...</i>

88
00:04:06,198 --> 00:04:09,463
<i>- was in the process of wooing her own man.
- Who is it?</i>

89
00:04:09,568 --> 00:04:13,834
<i>- Steve Holt!
- Maeby had even started
ordering unnecessary items...</i>

90
00:04:13,939 --> 00:04:15,839
<i>just to have more occasions
to see him.</i>

91
00:04:15,941 --> 00:04:18,000
Uh, you ordered a "Memories
ofThanksgiving" basket?

92
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:22,012
<i>- Wow, that looks great.
- Maeby, who's your friend?</i>

93
00:04:22,114 --> 00:04:25,049
- Is this your sister?
- No.

94
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,209
<i>But you just made my day.</i>

95
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:30,015
Thank you for the basket.
See ya.

96
00:04:31,723 --> 00:04:33,953
He thinks I'm cute.

97
00:04:34,059 --> 00:04:36,755
He's 19. He's a senior
at my high school.

98
00:04:36,862 --> 00:04:39,456
<i>And had been for several years.</i>

99
00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:45,296
<i>You know what?</i>

100
00:04:45,404 --> 00:04:48,396
<i>I think I am gonna spend more time
with my daughter.</i>

101
00:04:50,108 --> 00:04:53,134
I can't promise you I won't tell
the prosecutor about that.

102
00:04:55,914 --> 00:04:59,907
- Where you been?
- Are you wearing my
dead wife's maternity clothes?

103
00:05:00,018 --> 00:05:02,578
Yeah. It's the only thing
I could find.

104
00:05:02,688 --> 00:05:05,748
<i>- Where are the eggs?
- Doctor says they're bad for the baby.</i>

105
00:05:05,857 --> 00:05:09,486
- So, you ready for this new prosecutor?
- I was until you came back.

106
00:05:09,594 --> 00:05:11,494
You're not gonna
turn me in, are you?

107
00:05:11,596 --> 00:05:14,759
Because I had no idea there were sanctions
against, uh, Iraq.

108
00:05:14,866 --> 00:05:17,334
<i>You know, th-they sent me over there.
They said, "Go build."</i>

109
00:05:17,436 --> 00:05:20,428
Uh- Uh, Do I look like
a criminal mastermind to you?

110
00:05:20,539 --> 00:05:23,565
How do you get this ham open?
I can't- I can't get this ham open.

111
00:05:23,675 --> 00:05:26,610
I'm not gonna turn you in. But you have put me
in a position where I'm gonna have to lie.

112
00:05:26,712 --> 00:05:28,612
Why did you come back here
in the first place?

113
00:05:28,714 --> 00:05:32,741
<i>Oh, no reason. Your mother happens
to be shtupping my brother, that's all.</i>

114
00:05:32,851 --> 00:05:34,751
<i>I'm only here to find out
if I have a shot with her.</i>

115
00:05:34,853 --> 00:05:38,084
If she's really in love with Oscar-
I don't know- to hell with her.

116
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,590
I'll just-
I'll just leave.

117
00:05:42,394 --> 00:05:44,954
- I'll never come back.
- Great. She's really in love with him.

118
00:05:45,063 --> 00:05:48,362
That's very funny.
I need you to find out, okay?

119
00:05:48,467 --> 00:05:50,435
<i>'Cause ever since
l- I heard about this-</i>

120
00:05:50,535 --> 00:05:52,662
I can't sleep.

121
00:05:52,771 --> 00:05:55,103
I can't- I can't eat.

122
00:05:55,207 --> 00:05:58,802
Oh. Look, it just peels off.
Isn't that clever?

123
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:03,006
<i>Later that day,
George Michael was having his eye exam...</i>

124
00:06:03,115 --> 00:06:05,549
<i>and finding it to be just as difficult
as his math exam.</i>

125
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:08,050
- One or two?
- Two. No. No, one.

126
00:06:08,153 --> 00:06:11,714
- Okay. Two or three?
- Three.

127
00:06:13,024 --> 00:06:14,924
Uh, unless three is too much
of an improvement.

128
00:06:15,026 --> 00:06:17,722
I'm sorry.
Is one- Is one in the mix still?

129
00:06:17,829 --> 00:06:20,957
<i>And Michael met
with the new prosecutor, WayneJarvis.</i>

130
00:06:21,066 --> 00:06:23,591
I'm sorry. I don't understand
how this is not a conflict of interest.

131
00:06:23,702 --> 00:06:25,795
You almost represented us,
and now you're the prosecutor.

132
00:06:25,904 --> 00:06:27,804
The Patriot Act. Read it.

133
00:06:27,906 --> 00:06:30,340
L-I'm not even the president anymore.
My brother Gob is.

134
00:06:30,442 --> 00:06:32,637
<i>I spoke with Gob.
He appears to know nothing.</i>

135
00:06:32,744 --> 00:06:35,474
<i>Yeah, that's not an act.
He twice tried to microwave...</i>

136
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,639
<i>a Ding Dong
while it was still in its foil.</i>

137
00:06:37,749 --> 00:06:39,410
- Twice.
- Twice?

138
00:06:39,518 --> 00:06:43,648
<i>- Two times.
- In fact, Gob had been grilled earlier.</i>

139
00:06:43,755 --> 00:06:46,588
- I don't know anything about the business!
- We're gonna get you, Bluth.

140
00:06:46,691 --> 00:06:49,854
We'll give you a few minutes
to think about what you want to do.

141
00:06:52,697 --> 00:06:55,029
He knows less than anyone
we have ever questioned.

142
00:06:55,133 --> 00:06:57,601
<i>Gob knew too little
to know that, however...</i>

143
00:06:57,702 --> 00:07:01,194
<i>and his confidence
had never been more shaken.</i>

144
00:07:01,306 --> 00:07:04,605
<i>Andjust when he thought he couldn't
handle another embarrassment-</i>

145
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:06,609
You're free to go.

146
00:07:06,711 --> 00:07:10,647
<i>Things could get very messy for you, Michael,
unless you have something to bargain with...</i>

147
00:07:10,749 --> 00:07:13,183
like, say, a fugitive.

148
00:07:13,285 --> 00:07:15,617
<i>- I don't know where to find such a thing.
- Look harder.</i>

149
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,951
- There might be something in it for you.
- Something to get me off?

150
00:07:19,057 --> 00:07:21,855
<i>If you could find
a certain someone.</i>

151
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,555
Can I have a moment alone
with my client, please?

152
00:07:25,664 --> 00:07:29,100
Did you follow any of that?

153
00:07:29,201 --> 00:07:31,567
Yeah. He's hinting that
he's gonna grant me immunity...

154
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:33,865
but only on the condition
that I turn in my father.

155
00:07:33,972 --> 00:07:36,873
You know where your father is?
No, wait. Don't tell me now.

156
00:07:36,975 --> 00:07:40,502
<i>Okay. If you know,
give me a high five.</i>

157
00:07:42,147 --> 00:07:44,047
Mm-mmm.

158
00:07:46,951 --> 00:07:48,816
<i>Michael had just found out...</i>

159
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,913
<i>that his legal problems might go away
ifhe turned in his father.</i>

160
00:07:53,024 --> 00:07:54,992
It's just you and me now, huh?

161
00:07:55,092 --> 00:07:59,552
No, Barry, l- I know
where my father is, okay?

162
00:07:59,664 --> 00:08:02,827
He came back to make sure that my mother
wasn't really in love with my uncle.

163
00:08:02,934 --> 00:08:06,165
He wants to know if he's still got a shot with her.
If he doesn't, he's leaving.

164
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,898
If he's got a shot with her,
just give me a little tap on the fanny.

165
00:08:09,006 --> 00:08:10,906
- That's not gonna happen.
- Okay.

166
00:08:11,008 --> 00:08:14,739
Then look, just tell him anything
he wants to hear to keep him from running.

167
00:08:14,846 --> 00:08:17,110
We just have to keep him here
until we can hear...

168
00:08:17,215 --> 00:08:19,115
what kind of deal
they're offering you.

169
00:08:19,217 --> 00:08:22,550
You just trust me.
I'm a lot more competent than you can imagine.

170
00:08:24,388 --> 00:08:27,357
Oh, I forgot to take
the tinfoil off too.

171
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,358
I really wanted that.

172
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:32,520
<i>Buster, meanwhile, was sharing his failure...</i>

173
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,359
<i>with someone who was
well-versed on the subject.</i>

174
00:08:34,465 --> 00:08:38,458
I mean, I couldn't get over the wall.
They put me on suspension until I can.

175
00:08:38,569 --> 00:08:40,799
Perhaps you need to find somebody
who can motivate you.

176
00:08:40,905 --> 00:08:43,635
<i>- Yeah, but who?
- And then it hit him.</i>

177
00:08:43,741 --> 00:08:46,869
<i>Gob had always proven
a good motivator for Buster.</i>

178
00:08:46,978 --> 00:08:50,436
Do it!

179
00:08:50,548 --> 00:08:53,642
When you do this without getting punched
in the chest, you'll have more fun.

180
00:08:53,751 --> 00:08:56,413
- Thanks, Brother.
- Hey, Brother...

181
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,148
how would you like to go
to the old playground with me?

182
00:08:59,257 --> 00:09:02,658
I'm sure as hell not gonna go back to work.
I'm never going back there.

183
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,163
Oh. Well, then perchance I might be able
to borrow your cellular telephone?

184
00:09:07,265 --> 00:09:09,665
I'm not fit
to run a company.

185
00:09:09,767 --> 00:09:11,667
And I don't deserve
a fancy phone.

186
00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:15,899
<i>Well, the Blue Man Group might need me.
And I do deserve a fancy phone.</i>

187
00:09:16,007 --> 00:09:18,407
<i>They didn't, and he doesn't.</i>

188
00:09:18,509 --> 00:09:20,977
<i>Michael knew he couldn't
let his father get away.</i>

189
00:09:21,078 --> 00:09:24,536
<i>So he decided to see ifhis mother
and Oscar really were in love.</i>

190
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:27,982
So, come on. Aren't you really just dating
Oscar to get back at Dad?

191
00:09:28,085 --> 00:09:30,610
Oh, it may have
started as that...

192
00:09:30,721 --> 00:09:34,589
but I have
fallen in love with Oscar.

193
00:09:34,692 --> 00:09:37,422
And it's so nice not to have to worry
about getting pregnant.

194
00:09:37,528 --> 00:09:40,520
The doctor said
I couldn't be a mother now if I tried.

195
00:09:40,631 --> 00:09:42,656
And that was without
even interviewing me.

196
00:09:42,767 --> 00:09:44,758
Here you go. Hot tea.

197
00:09:44,869 --> 00:09:48,100
Because that's what you are-
a hottie.

198
00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:55,042
Stop me from pouring this on myself.
I can't take this anymore.

199
00:09:55,146 --> 00:09:57,046
All right. Now, listen, Oscar.

200
00:09:57,148 --> 00:09:59,343
Maybe you should think
about moving on, you know.

201
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:03,284
This really isn't your scene,
with the sweaters and the furniture.

202
00:10:03,387 --> 00:10:06,356
Maybe you should take a leap at freedom,
like my father.

203
00:10:06,457 --> 00:10:08,357
Just run.

204
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:11,394
Is that her rape horn?

205
00:10:11,495 --> 00:10:14,726
It's more like
a starter's pistol.

206
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,393
Run.

207
00:10:20,738 --> 00:10:23,832
<i>Meanwhile, Tobias set about
learning how to operate his new cell phone.</i>

208
00:10:23,941 --> 00:10:26,409
Oh!

209
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:29,445
<i>And Lindsay tried to spend
more time getting to know her daughter.</i>

210
00:10:29,547 --> 00:10:33,142
Hi, baby. Oh, Steve. Hi.

211
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,480
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

212
00:10:35,586 --> 00:10:37,747
I thought I'd spend a little time
with my daughter.

213
00:10:37,855 --> 00:10:40,187
<i>After all, it hasn't been that long
since I've been in high school.</i>

214
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,316
Is that a fire?

215
00:10:42,426 --> 00:10:45,759
- We have to go to class.
- Okay. Well, this was fun.

216
00:10:45,863 --> 00:10:50,664
Maybe later we can all spend a little
more time together. Go shopping. Get a drink.

217
00:10:50,768 --> 00:10:52,998
<i>I'm in school.
And I'm 15.</i>

218
00:10:53,104 --> 00:10:57,006
Oh. Well, I'm much, much, much...

219
00:10:57,108 --> 00:10:59,008
older than 15.

220
00:11:00,111 --> 00:11:02,011
- You don't look it.
- Oh, Steve.

221
00:11:02,113 --> 00:11:04,877
He thinks I'm young.
You made my day again!

222
00:11:09,687 --> 00:11:12,815
- Your mom's pretty, uh, out there.
- She's not my mom.

223
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:14,914
But she said
you were her daughter.

224
00:11:15,026 --> 00:11:17,358
His daughter.
That's my dad.

225
00:11:17,461 --> 00:11:20,123
- That's a dude?
- And the worst part is...

226
00:11:20,231 --> 00:11:22,131
he thinks he's passing.

227
00:11:25,202 --> 00:11:28,296
<i>Right outside the school,
Buster tried to put his own plan...</i>

228
00:11:28,406 --> 00:11:30,772
<i>into action
by stirring up old memories.</i>

229
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:34,038
What do you say?
I need your help to get over the wall. Push me.

230
00:11:34,145 --> 00:11:36,079
I'm the pathetic one, Buster,
not you.

231
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,705
I totally freaked out in front
of that prosecutor today.

232
00:11:38,816 --> 00:11:41,649
Like a little girl
in a little dress-

233
00:11:41,752 --> 00:11:44,721
little saddle shoes,
little pigtails.

234
00:11:44,822 --> 00:11:47,052
Wow, that does sound
like a little girl.

235
00:11:47,158 --> 00:11:49,285
<i>Come on, get my ire up.</i>

236
00:11:49,393 --> 00:11:51,293
Push me!

237
00:11:51,395 --> 00:11:53,295
Oh.

238
00:11:55,366 --> 00:11:58,164
Oh, this is turning out to be
much more fun than I'd hoped.

239
00:11:58,269 --> 00:12:00,931
<i>It was fun. But it wasn't
making him a better soldier.</i>

240
00:12:01,038 --> 00:12:02,938
Push me higher.

241
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,008
Ooh! I'll do it.

242
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:08,110
Whoo!

243
00:12:08,212 --> 00:12:11,545
<i>And Michael reported to
his father about his meeting with the prosecutor.</i>

244
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:14,049
- Prosecutor offer you a deal?
- That was not said.

245
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:19,418
But, uh, more importantly, you should know
that it seems like Oscar's on his way out.

246
00:12:19,523 --> 00:12:23,084
- Really?
- Yeah. So just sit tight,
and everything should be fine.

247
00:12:24,628 --> 00:12:27,426
<i>Wow. Hey, by the way,
I broke this thing. L-</i>

248
00:12:27,531 --> 00:12:30,329
- What the hell is it anyway?
- That's a breast pump, Dad.

249
00:12:30,434 --> 00:12:33,631
Oh. Well, I did not
use it for that.

250
00:12:33,737 --> 00:12:37,036
<i>And so Michael went to meet the prosecutor.</i>

251
00:12:37,141 --> 00:12:39,166
I felt obligated to share
some photographs with you.

252
00:12:39,276 --> 00:12:41,437
I obtained these from
the Bluth Company e-mail server.

253
00:12:41,545 --> 00:12:43,945
You tapped into our e-mail?
That's legal?

254
00:12:44,048 --> 00:12:45,948
I'm going for a hot Ding Dong.

255
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:48,985
Hot Ding Dong? Yeah?

256
00:12:49,086 --> 00:12:52,783
Michael, this is a close-up satellite photograph
of the Iraqi countryside.

257
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:55,381
See this little series of hills
around that stream?

258
00:12:55,493 --> 00:12:57,484
Those are bunkers.
We believe that those bunkers...

259
00:12:57,595 --> 00:12:59,722
contain weapons
of mass destruction.

260
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:03,664
We also think that your father
was building on that land to hide them.

261
00:13:03,767 --> 00:13:06,463
<i>Which is why that photograph
was on his e-mail.</i>

262
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:09,198
- Are you serious?
- Almost always.

263
00:13:09,306 --> 00:13:12,673
I was once called the worst audience
participant Cirque Du Soleil ever had.

264
00:13:12,776 --> 00:13:15,973
- This is a big accusation.
- I did not find their buffoonery amusing.

265
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:20,813
- About my father.
- He's guilty, Michael, of medium to heavy treason.

266
00:13:20,918 --> 00:13:23,011
That proves it.
You can't protect him.

267
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,987
Turn him in
and immunity is yours.

268
00:13:28,459 --> 00:13:30,859
<i>Michael returned home
to confront his father.
- Michael?</i>

269
00:13:30,961 --> 00:13:32,861
Mom was just here
looking for you.

270
00:13:32,963 --> 00:13:35,158
She's claiming Oscar's disappeared
because of something you said.

271
00:13:35,266 --> 00:13:37,234
- Can't talk right now.
- Really?

272
00:13:37,334 --> 00:13:39,325
<i>What's wrong with your voice?</i>

273
00:13:39,436 --> 00:13:42,030
I can talk, sure.
I didn't say anything to Oscar.

274
00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:44,039
- Anything else?
- No.

275
00:13:44,141 --> 00:13:47,076
Oh. Hey, did I tell you?
I accidentally ran into Steve Holt.

276
00:13:47,178 --> 00:13:49,738
Wow. Everything about you
is so womanly.

277
00:13:49,847 --> 00:13:52,008
You're everything
a woman should be.

278
00:13:52,116 --> 00:13:54,710
Thank you, Steve.

279
00:13:54,818 --> 00:13:56,410
We ended up
making a lunch date.

280
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,454
I thought you were
spending time with Maeby.

281
00:13:58,556 --> 00:14:00,547
Yeah. I'll have to
reschedule her.

282
00:14:00,658 --> 00:14:04,754
But Mom isn't the only one "finding love"
where she least expects it. Her words.

283
00:14:04,862 --> 00:14:08,628
Wh-Whoa! Finding love-
She said that? Where, here?

284
00:14:08,732 --> 00:14:10,632
Yeah, she won't
shut up about him.

285
00:14:10,734 --> 00:14:12,702
She said "tingling,"
like, 75 times.

286
00:14:12,803 --> 00:14:17,570
<i>Gets me tingling.
And, you know, with Oscar there's tingling.</i>

287
00:14:17,675 --> 00:14:21,873
- She said those words in this house?
- Yeah.

288
00:14:21,979 --> 00:14:23,708
Dad?

289
00:14:23,814 --> 00:14:25,714
Hello?

290
00:14:29,856 --> 00:14:33,019
<i>Michael had just discovered
that his father had escaped from the attic.</i>

291
00:14:33,126 --> 00:14:35,026
Hello?

292
00:14:35,128 --> 00:14:37,653
This is gonna sound like a strange question,
but have you seen Dad?

293
00:14:37,764 --> 00:14:39,664
Of course not.
And I'm not talking to you.

294
00:14:39,766 --> 00:14:42,200
You tried to scare away Oscar,
which didn't work.

295
00:14:42,302 --> 00:14:45,135
- He's back.
- I just, uh-

296
00:14:45,238 --> 00:14:48,537
I just wanted to have sex with you.
That's-That's all I'm good for.

297
00:14:48,642 --> 00:14:51,202
Did you hear that?
He said he just wants to-

298
00:14:51,311 --> 00:14:53,802
- Good-bye, Mom.
- Have sex with me.

299
00:14:56,983 --> 00:14:59,543
- You smell like a pinecone.
- Yeah, that's the weed.

300
00:14:59,653 --> 00:15:02,178
I went to my, uh,
my- hole trailer...

301
00:15:02,289 --> 00:15:04,484
and l- I smoked some
like a cigarette.

302
00:15:04,591 --> 00:15:07,025
Should we take it
into the bedroom?

303
00:15:08,295 --> 00:15:11,560
- Only if you really love me.
- Of course I do.

304
00:15:14,301 --> 00:15:16,667
Ohh.

305
00:15:18,772 --> 00:15:21,172
<i>What's wrong with you?
Where are you going?</i>

306
00:15:21,274 --> 00:15:23,299
I'm on mushrooms!

307
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:26,311
I'm on bad mushrooms!

308
00:15:26,413 --> 00:15:29,041
<i>And soon,
the prosecutor's evidence became public.</i>

309
00:15:29,149 --> 00:15:34,086
We've obtained photographs that officials
call definite proof of W.M.D.'s in Iraq.

310
00:15:34,187 --> 00:15:36,485
What that means
for your weekend at 10:00.

311
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:40,219
<i>It seems that due
to the new information-sharing provisions...</i>

312
00:15:40,327 --> 00:15:42,761
<i>in the Patriot Act, the photos
had made the rounds...</i>

313
00:15:42,863 --> 00:15:45,889
<i>through several branches
of government...</i>

314
00:15:45,999 --> 00:15:48,126
<i>and ultimately
to the U.S. Army itself.</i>

315
00:15:48,235 --> 00:15:50,362
I just came back to tell you.
I can't do that wall.

316
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:52,700
There's no time for that.
We're shipping out without you.

317
00:15:52,806 --> 00:15:54,865
- What?
- Didn't you see?

318
00:15:54,975 --> 00:15:59,674
<i>- Pick it up. Pick it up.
- Weapons of mass destruction?</i>

319
00:15:59,779 --> 00:16:01,906
- Those bastards.
- I did not say that.

320
00:16:02,015 --> 00:16:05,917
Are you gonna let that slide?
Are you gonna allow your children...

321
00:16:06,019 --> 00:16:08,044
and your children's children...

322
00:16:08,154 --> 00:16:10,122
and any children
that I might have out there...

323
00:16:10,223 --> 00:16:12,953
to live in fear
for the rest of their lives?

324
00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:15,892
Climb that wall, homo!

325
00:16:15,996 --> 00:16:17,930
Climb it.

326
00:16:18,031 --> 00:16:20,898
<i>Andjust as the men
thought the day could get no more surprising...</i>

327
00:16:21,001 --> 00:16:22,901
<i>it did.</i>

328
00:16:23,003 --> 00:16:24,903
Ohh! Ooh!

329
00:16:25,005 --> 00:16:28,463
When you do this without getting
punched, you'll have more fun.

330
00:16:28,575 --> 00:16:31,976
- Oh, hey, George Michael.
- Oh, hi.

331
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:34,069
They found W.M.D.'s in Iraq,
so we got a half-day.

332
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:37,149
Cool. So I got
a "C" on my math test.

333
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,480
Not anticipating
a good reaction on that.

334
00:16:39,586 --> 00:16:43,078
Well, the "B" got you glasses.
Maybe this time you'll get a neck brace.

335
00:16:43,189 --> 00:16:46,488
Anyways, have you seen my mom?

336
00:16:46,593 --> 00:16:48,493
Seems possible.

337
00:16:48,595 --> 00:16:50,893
<i>- She's on her way to meet Steve Holt.
- I thought you liked him.</i>

338
00:16:50,997 --> 00:16:53,295
I do. I'm crazy about him.
But he's obsessed with her.

339
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,300
<i>That's all he wants
to talk about.</i>

340
00:16:55,402 --> 00:16:57,962
<i>Lindsay felt bad.
Perhaps she had hurt her daughter...</i>

341
00:16:58,071 --> 00:16:59,971
<i>by putting herself first.</i>

342
00:17:00,073 --> 00:17:02,564
<i>But she would have felt worse
if she'd remained even a moment longer.</i>

343
00:17:02,676 --> 00:17:05,008
But it's only because
he thinks she's got a penis.

344
00:17:05,111 --> 00:17:07,272
Oh, I told him
she was a tranny.

345
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,678
<i>Meanwhile, Michael was still up in the attic.</i>

346
00:17:09,783 --> 00:17:12,047
Dad, what's goin' on?
Somebody could see you.

347
00:17:12,152 --> 00:17:15,588
What's the difference, Mike?
You're turning me in, aren't you?

348
00:17:15,689 --> 00:17:18,522
They say you're involved in something
real big, Dad. They've got photos.

349
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,991
Not true. But go.
Knock yourself out. Turn me in.

350
00:17:21,094 --> 00:17:24,325
<i>I went and I saw for myself.</i>

351
00:17:24,431 --> 00:17:26,331
She's in love with him.

352
00:17:29,235 --> 00:17:32,033
<i>Then why did you come back?
Why didn't you just leave forever like you said?</i>

353
00:17:32,138 --> 00:17:34,038
And go where?

354
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,007
Make a deal for yourself, Mike.

355
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:39,101
I got no love
in my life anymore.

356
00:17:39,212 --> 00:17:41,646
<i>And Michael realized for the first time...</i>

357
00:17:41,748 --> 00:17:45,377
<i>that his father was capable
ofhaving his heart broken.</i>

358
00:17:45,485 --> 00:17:47,612
<i>Later that day,
Michael had his meeting with the prosecutor.</i>

359
00:17:47,721 --> 00:17:50,884
So, where the hell is he?
Come on, Bluth. What's it gonna be?

360
00:17:50,991 --> 00:17:53,551
Your father or your freedom?

361
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:56,060
<i>And Michael had to do the right thing.</i>

362
00:17:56,162 --> 00:17:58,687
I don't know
what happened to him.

363
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:04,193
Michael, when we started talking to you,
we didn't have anything.

364
00:18:04,304 --> 00:18:07,034
But now... we got something.

365
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,041
- And you're gonna do time for it.
- Those are the pictures?

366
00:18:10,143 --> 00:18:12,543
They're all over the news.

367
00:18:12,646 --> 00:18:15,012
- Those are balls.
- What?

368
00:18:15,115 --> 00:18:18,482
<i>Barry was right. Tobias had
inadvertently photographed himself...</i>

369
00:18:18,585 --> 00:18:20,485
<i>while learning to use
his camera phone.</i>

370
00:18:20,587 --> 00:18:23,750
See, uh, this close,
they always look like landscape.

371
00:18:23,857 --> 00:18:27,054
Nope, you're lookin' at balls.

372
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,720
<i>Soon, forensic scientists confirmed this.</i>

373
00:18:29,829 --> 00:18:31,854
<i>And for the second time
in two days...</i>

374
00:18:31,965 --> 00:18:35,401
<i>the information-sharing network
put into place by the Patriot Act...</i>

375
00:18:35,502 --> 00:18:37,402
<i>was put to use.</i>

376
00:18:37,504 --> 00:18:40,268
They're balls?

377
00:18:40,373 --> 00:18:42,273
<i>We're looking at balls. Let's turn it around.</i>

378
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:44,275
<i>Copy on balls. We're turning.</i>

379
00:18:44,377 --> 00:18:46,845
<i>And eventually, the news
traveled back to the source.</i>

380
00:18:46,946 --> 00:18:50,438
We got one wrong,
and we do apologize.

381
00:18:53,887 --> 00:18:55,912
I'm on TV.

382
00:18:56,022 --> 00:18:58,252
<i>And Michael returned home a free man.</i>

383
00:18:58,358 --> 00:19:01,589
You got the glasses.
Now you'll do better on those math exams.

384
00:19:01,695 --> 00:19:05,131
I think I blew the eye exam too.
Every time I take these off, I feel better.

385
00:19:05,231 --> 00:19:08,257
Let me see 'em.

386
00:19:08,368 --> 00:19:11,462
<i>- I've seen this before.
- For a while, George Michael...</i>

387
00:19:11,571 --> 00:19:13,835
<i>had shared a room
with his Uncle Tobias.</i>

388
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:16,534
- Oh, th-there's a ladder.
- I don't need it.

389
00:19:18,978 --> 00:19:21,446
Yeah, I don't think
you need glasses, Son.

390
00:19:22,749 --> 00:19:25,912
Well, if the cops are waiting,
I'm ready to go.

391
00:19:26,019 --> 00:19:27,987
I got nothin'
since your mother deserted me.

392
00:19:28,088 --> 00:19:29,988
You know,
you-you deserted her, Dad.

393
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:31,990
You know, you escaped,
and then you faked your death.

394
00:19:32,092 --> 00:19:34,390
I'm not so sure she sees you
as that reliable.

395
00:19:34,494 --> 00:19:36,826
But, listen,
for what it's worth...

396
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:38,830
I did not turn you in.

397
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,668
- You didn't?
- No.

398
00:19:42,769 --> 00:19:45,329
And I don't know whether
it's just Tracy's maternity clothes...

399
00:19:45,438 --> 00:19:49,101
but it's very nice to see
a softer side of you.

400
00:19:49,209 --> 00:19:52,508
Although I'm sorry that you feel
you have no love in your life.

401
00:19:52,612 --> 00:19:55,012
Well, I don't-
I don't feel that way anymore.

402
00:19:57,584 --> 00:19:59,484
Thanks.

403
00:19:59,586 --> 00:20:02,350
Been a long time
since someone stood up for me.

404
00:20:05,959 --> 00:20:08,519
- Found her perfume, huh?
- Just a little left in the bottle.

405
00:20:08,628 --> 00:20:10,687
- Well, that was the end of it.
- Yeah.

406
00:20:10,797 --> 00:20:12,697
- It's nice on you.
- Thank you.

407
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,597
<i>On the next
Arrested Development.</i>

408
00:20:15,702 --> 00:20:18,762
<i>Oscar returns to find
a now-distant Lucille.</i>

409
00:20:18,872 --> 00:20:21,966
I'm back.
But just for now.

410
00:20:22,075 --> 00:20:24,100
'Cause you get
on my case- shoo-

411
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:26,940
- I am out of here.
- Then go. Who needs you?

412
00:20:27,046 --> 00:20:28,980
<i>Which was what attracted him to her...</i>

413
00:20:29,082 --> 00:20:32,108
<i>- in the first place.
- God, I missed you.</i>

414
00:20:32,218 --> 00:20:35,551
<i>- Lindsay reconciles with her daughter.
- Hey, Mom. I got you somethin'.</i>

415
00:20:35,655 --> 00:20:37,748
That is so sweet.

416
00:20:37,857 --> 00:20:40,291
You know what? I was hoping
we could go to dinner tonight.

417
00:20:40,393 --> 00:20:42,861
Oh, I thought you were gonna
go see Steve Holt at school.

418
00:20:42,962 --> 00:20:44,862
No, I just wanted
to check him out...

419
00:20:44,964 --> 00:20:47,728
and make sure he's good enough
for my daughter.

420
00:20:47,834 --> 00:20:50,200
- Is it-
- It's a "Sheh-ma-lee."

421
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:52,271
It's gorgeous.

422
00:20:52,372 --> 00:20:54,397
I'm wearing it to dinner.
