1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:04,421
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:04,523 --> 00:00:06,514
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:06,625 --> 00:00:08,616
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:14,166 --> 00:00:15,861
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

5
00:00:18,804 --> 00:00:21,705
<i>Michael was using
the Bluth Company crane...</i>

6
00:00:21,807 --> 00:00:26,039
<i>to retrieve the family-owned frozen banana stand
after it had been dumped in the bay...</i>

7
00:00:26,145 --> 00:00:28,978
<i>a holiday tradition
among the local youth.</i>

8
00:00:29,081 --> 00:00:32,881
<i>- Soon he returned home so that he and his son-
- George Michael?</i>

9
00:00:32,985 --> 00:00:35,385
<i>Could share
their holiday tradition of rebuilding it.</i>

10
00:00:35,487 --> 00:00:37,955
- Another one of Dad's suits?
- Hey, I'm the president now.

11
00:00:38,057 --> 00:00:42,255
I'm filling Dad's shoes...
literally, except his shoes don't fit.

12
00:00:42,361 --> 00:00:44,625
But I did finally get
into Dad's pants...

13
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,824
although I had to have
the crotch taken in a little.

14
00:00:47,933 --> 00:00:50,629
You know, Gob, maybe it's the suits,
but I think you may be beginning...

15
00:00:50,736 --> 00:00:53,830
to alienate some
of the employees down at work.

16
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:56,464
What? Oh, that's great.

17
00:00:56,575 --> 00:01:00,011
The president has to worry
about alienating the employees now.

18
00:01:00,112 --> 00:01:03,639
<i>In fact, Gob had started
to alienate some ofhis colleagues.</i>

19
00:01:03,749 --> 00:01:08,482
The worst that could happen is I could
spill some on my $3,000 suit. Come on!

20
00:01:08,587 --> 00:01:11,454
- Hey!
- The guy in the $4,000 suit...

21
00:01:11,557 --> 00:01:14,424
is holding the elevator for the guy
who doesn't make that in three months.

22
00:01:16,395 --> 00:01:18,829
Why don't I just take a whiz
through this $5,000 suit?

23
00:01:18,931 --> 00:01:22,458
Come on! They like me just fine.
You'll see that tonight...

24
00:01:22,568 --> 00:01:25,969
when they toast me at the Christmas party,
just like they used to with Dad.

25
00:01:26,071 --> 00:01:28,232
<i>They used to roast Dad
'cause they thought that...</i>

26
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,275
he had a sense of humor about himself,
but he didn't, and neither do you.

27
00:01:31,376 --> 00:01:34,436
Hey, nobody laughed louder
than me at any joke about Dad.

28
00:01:34,546 --> 00:01:38,482
<i>You're the one who's all Mr.
"I take myself too seriously all the time."</i>

29
00:01:38,584 --> 00:01:41,451
<i>Michael did tend to take
the Christmas party somewhat seriously.</i>

30
00:01:41,553 --> 00:01:44,852
Merry Christmas. You can go ahead
and put that right in the charity barrel.

31
00:01:44,957 --> 00:01:47,755
Thanks a lot. Sorry, pal.
We just can't have them resent us.

32
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:51,921
<i>I know some of the numbers haven't all
added up, and there is some speculation...</i>

33
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:55,830
that George has been into the kitty-

34
00:01:55,934 --> 00:01:58,129
"Into the kitty"! That's awesome.

35
00:01:58,237 --> 00:02:01,900
Fire Tom
and get your jackass brother out of here.

36
00:02:02,007 --> 00:02:05,636
This year I'm not officially president,
and it'll be nice to actually have some fun...

37
00:02:05,744 --> 00:02:08,008
with my son
at a Christmas party.

38
00:02:08,113 --> 00:02:10,911
- Thank God I don't have to go.
- So glad to hear you say that.

39
00:02:11,016 --> 00:02:12,813
I wanna meet someone there.

40
00:02:12,918 --> 00:02:15,250
What? So I'm not invited to
the Bluth Company Christmas party?

41
00:02:15,354 --> 00:02:18,983
Oh, honey, of course
you can go if you want to.

42
00:02:19,091 --> 00:02:22,151
- Thanks, Mom.
- No. You're not going to that.

43
00:02:22,261 --> 00:02:25,753
You see, if I show up with you,
it'll just make me seem like I'm a mother.

44
00:02:25,864 --> 00:02:28,526
- I've never thought of you that way.
- That's sweet.

45
00:02:28,634 --> 00:02:33,867
<i>Well, I won't be going. I will
be head to toe in blue makeup until 8:01...</i>

46
00:02:33,972 --> 00:02:35,906
in case the Blue Man Group
needs their understudy, so-

47
00:02:36,008 --> 00:02:38,499
No, no, you have to go.
So when men find out...

48
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,942
we're in an open relationship,
they'll see you're no threat.

49
00:02:41,046 --> 00:02:45,107
People hear the name Tobias,
they think big, black guy.

50
00:02:45,217 --> 00:02:47,742
Well, obviously I'm not a big guy.

51
00:02:47,853 --> 00:02:50,447
<i>I'm not a Carl Weathers, par exemple.</i>

52
00:02:50,556 --> 00:02:53,719
I forgot about Carl.
Is he still single?

53
00:02:53,825 --> 00:02:57,693
Hey, George Michael, I need you
to help me fix up the banana stand.

54
00:02:57,796 --> 00:03:00,196
No, I can't. I was supposed
to go to Ann's parents' Christmas party.

55
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:03,894
- We're makin' yams.
- Tonight? Tonight is the office party.

56
00:03:04,002 --> 00:03:07,870
Well, did you want me to go to that? You're
always telling me not to have fun at those things.

57
00:03:07,973 --> 00:03:11,204
Yes. We might even
snatch a gift from the charity barrel.

58
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:15,872
Oh. Okay, well-well, I think Ann's parents
are having their party on Bethlehem time...

59
00:03:15,981 --> 00:03:18,040
which is pretty early,
so maybe I can make an appearance.

60
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:21,278
Make an appearance?
Uh- Uh- No, no. It's okay.

61
00:03:21,386 --> 00:03:24,150
- You be with Yam. It's fine. It's good.
- It's Ann.

62
00:03:24,256 --> 00:03:26,554
It's good. Have fun.

63
00:03:26,658 --> 00:03:30,185
<i>The boy's pulling away from you.
Are we having yams?</i>

64
00:03:30,295 --> 00:03:33,230
Yeah, I don't know what's goin' on with him.
You know, he's on Bethlehem time.

65
00:03:33,332 --> 00:03:35,266
He's spending every moment
of the day with this girl.

66
00:03:35,367 --> 00:03:38,234
- It's, like, I'm his father.
He should be spending most-
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

67
00:03:38,337 --> 00:03:42,774
Don't get involved. Believe me. When
I thought your first wife was driving us apart...

68
00:03:42,874 --> 00:03:44,842
I did not make a stink.

69
00:03:44,943 --> 00:03:49,573
You complained all the time,
and she was my only wife. And she died.

70
00:03:49,681 --> 00:03:52,844
Well, see, things have a way
of working themselves out.

71
00:03:52,951 --> 00:03:55,749
Nonetheless, it's family first at the holidays.

72
00:03:55,854 --> 00:03:58,584
<i>- Oh, God. It's Mom again.
- Put it on speakerphone.</i>

73
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:01,158
I wanna hear
her beautiful voice.

74
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,990
Michael! There's a hole in the window!
There's been a break-in!

75
00:04:04,096 --> 00:04:06,326
- Get over here!
- I'm leaving now.

76
00:04:06,431 --> 00:04:08,399
Sounds tense.

77
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,869
That means she's not gettin' any
from my brother, Oscar. Lovely. That's nice.

78
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,209
I heard about the banana stand,
and now there's been a break-in.

79
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:21,643
But I have a surprise
for whoever it is if he comes back.

80
00:04:21,747 --> 00:04:24,272
First I blow him;
then I poke him.

81
00:04:24,383 --> 00:04:27,352
Guy has no idea
what he's in for.

82
00:04:27,452 --> 00:04:32,151
You know, Mom, all the glass seems to be
on the outside. Plus, here's your little statue...

83
00:04:32,257 --> 00:04:36,193
<i>so I guess what this says to me is,
I doubt anyone was trying to break in, Mom.</i>

84
00:04:36,295 --> 00:04:39,287
If anything, someone was trying
to break out. Where is Oscar?

85
00:04:39,398 --> 00:04:42,799
Well, he's on his walkabout
or pilgrimage.

86
00:04:42,901 --> 00:04:46,462
<i>Every year,
Oscar attempts the 420-mile walk...</i>

87
00:04:46,571 --> 00:04:49,233
<i>from Newport Beach
to Berkeley, California.</i>

88
00:04:49,341 --> 00:04:52,139
<i>In the 12 years
he's attempted this...</i>

89
00:04:52,244 --> 00:04:56,010
<i>he's never made it past U.C. Irvine.</i>

90
00:04:56,114 --> 00:04:59,572
He calls it a quest to recharge his chi.
I call it an excuse for him...

91
00:04:59,685 --> 00:05:02,153
to score his pot
and wag his pickle at coeds.

92
00:05:02,254 --> 00:05:05,417
You sound mad, Mom, mad enough
to throw one of these little lady heads at him.

93
00:05:05,524 --> 00:05:09,620
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Well, maybe you're a little bit lonely...

94
00:05:09,728 --> 00:05:12,162
and you're acting out
for attention.

95
00:05:12,264 --> 00:05:15,324
That's ridiculous.
I want you to move in with me.

96
00:05:15,434 --> 00:05:19,370
What? No. No. No.
No, no, no, no.

97
00:05:19,471 --> 00:05:22,770
Didn't you adopt a child for this very reason?
So that you would never be alone?

98
00:05:22,874 --> 00:05:26,241
Michael, a mother doesn't have a child
to give herself company.

99
00:05:26,345 --> 00:05:30,008
- Annyong was to teach Buster a lesson.
- And where is that little lesson?

100
00:05:30,115 --> 00:05:34,950
<i>I sent him to the Milford Academy to
teach him a lesson. I can't remember about what.</i>

101
00:05:35,053 --> 00:05:38,045
And Buster left this morning
to finish his army training.

102
00:05:38,156 --> 00:05:42,786
<i>In fact, Lucille had refused
to drive him to the army base...</i>

103
00:05:42,894 --> 00:05:45,795
<i>so Buster was taking
his very first bus ride.</i>

104
00:05:45,897 --> 00:05:48,297
- I can't change a hundred.
- Oh.

105
00:05:49,735 --> 00:05:53,637
Oh, God. Oh.

106
00:05:53,739 --> 00:05:57,072
<i>And that's when Buster
saw something interesting.</i>

107
00:05:58,844 --> 00:06:01,438
That could be good for army.

108
00:06:04,216 --> 00:06:08,414
<i>Whilejust 20 yards away,
Michael went to work repairing the banana stand.</i>

109
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,385
What are you doin' here?

110
00:06:10,489 --> 00:06:13,890
My mom signed me out of school early,
so she wouldn't have to pick me up later...

111
00:06:13,992 --> 00:06:16,051
so she wouldn't be late
for the Christmas party.

112
00:06:16,161 --> 00:06:18,789
- That's about the worst thing I've ever heard.
- I had to drive...

113
00:06:18,897 --> 00:06:22,094
- because she had a little bit of a buzz on.
- No. That's it.

114
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,897
- You doing this alone?
- Yeah. Well, thanks.

115
00:06:26,004 --> 00:06:29,064
I guess George Michael's gettin' a little too old
to hang out with his dad.

116
00:06:29,174 --> 00:06:32,075
- Yeah, and I'm getting too old
for my mom to be with me.
- You know what?

117
00:06:32,177 --> 00:06:34,577
- Maybe we should go to this party together.
- Really?

118
00:06:34,679 --> 00:06:37,307
Yeah. You're my little niece. I think
we should be spending more time together.

119
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:41,910
- And if it makes my mom jealous-
- And George Michael can run back
to his precious Ann.

120
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,648
Great. Good deal.

121
00:06:52,696 --> 00:06:55,961
<i>Michael and Maeby stopped
by the office to see if Gob needed help...</i>

122
00:06:56,066 --> 00:06:58,125
<i>for the party
that was now hours away.</i>

123
00:06:58,234 --> 00:07:00,930
...king $6,300 suit!

124
00:07:01,037 --> 00:07:03,369
- Come on!
- Hi there.

125
00:07:03,473 --> 00:07:08,342
- What's she doin' here?
- Merry Christmas to you too, Uncle Gob.

126
00:07:08,445 --> 00:07:12,108
- Everything all right?
- I just don't want people's kids
getting their sticky fingers...

127
00:07:12,215 --> 00:07:14,115
all over these $2,600 pants.

128
00:07:14,217 --> 00:07:16,276
Oh, yeah? You think
they're gonna go right for the pants?

129
00:07:16,386 --> 00:07:21,449
Okay, okay, okay. So, should-
should- should- should, should, should-

130
00:07:21,558 --> 00:07:25,551
- Shh.
- Should- should- should-

131
00:07:25,662 --> 00:07:27,789
<i>We'll do it your way.
I'm just here to have fun.</i>

132
00:07:27,897 --> 00:07:30,991
Not too much fun, all right? I already
gave my big sexual harassment speech today.

133
00:07:31,101 --> 00:07:34,400
And please refrain from
discussing or engaging...

134
00:07:34,504 --> 00:07:37,405
in any sort of interoffice-

135
00:07:37,507 --> 00:07:39,998
<i>Or-
Or finger-</i>

136
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:43,136
Or- fisting
or-

137
00:07:43,246 --> 00:07:49,185
Or even- even though
so many people in this office are begging for it.

138
00:07:49,285 --> 00:07:53,187
And if anybody does anything
with my sister Lindsay...

139
00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:57,658
<i>I'll take off my pants,
I'll shave-</i>

140
00:07:57,761 --> 00:07:59,991
And I'll personally-

141
00:08:00,096 --> 00:08:02,189
- Let's get this going.
- What are you talking about?

142
00:08:02,298 --> 00:08:04,858
Now? You're not gonna let these people
go home and change their clothes?

143
00:08:04,968 --> 00:08:08,369
I don't think we need people tryin'
to compete with what I'm wearing.

144
00:08:08,471 --> 00:08:12,498
Everybody, come out of your offices, please.
The party has now started.

145
00:08:12,609 --> 00:08:17,410
Here we go. Let's go.

146
00:08:19,382 --> 00:08:22,874
Everybody dance now.

147
00:08:22,986 --> 00:08:26,251
<i>Everybody dance now.</i>

148
00:08:28,158 --> 00:08:30,854
I think we're off
to a great start.

149
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,191
<i>And so, Michael started
to become relaxed, and a short time later...</i>

150
00:08:34,297 --> 00:08:36,322
<i>his mother arrived anything but.</i>

151
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:39,459
Someone broke in again.
The liquor is gone. All of it- gone.

152
00:08:39,569 --> 00:08:42,595
<i>In fact, Gob had stolen it earlier that day...</i>

153
00:08:42,706 --> 00:08:44,799
<i>to cut down on the cost
of the party.</i>

154
00:08:44,908 --> 00:08:49,368
- Hey, need a hand with that?
- No, Al. I wanna spill booze all over my f-

155
00:08:49,479 --> 00:08:52,880
- I'm all alone there, Michael.
- You know, Buster's only
stationed about five miles away.

156
00:08:52,982 --> 00:08:55,917
<i>In fact, Buster never went to the army.</i>

157
00:08:56,019 --> 00:09:00,922
<i>He'd gotten hooked playing the skill crane
and missed his first day.</i>

158
00:09:01,024 --> 00:09:05,051
<i>- Somewhat ashamed and with nowhere
to go, he returned home.
- Hey, Buster.</i>

159
00:09:05,161 --> 00:09:07,721
Buster!

160
00:09:07,831 --> 00:09:12,495
Thank God you're back!
There's no shame in being a coward.

161
00:09:12,602 --> 00:09:15,469
A coward? I'm not a coward.

162
00:09:15,572 --> 00:09:19,133
- Would a coward have this?
- What the hell is that?

163
00:09:19,242 --> 00:09:22,837
These are my awards, Mother,
from army.

164
00:09:22,946 --> 00:09:25,176
The seal is for marksmanship...

165
00:09:25,281 --> 00:09:28,580
and the gorilla is for sand racing.

166
00:09:28,685 --> 00:09:31,813
- You're doing well?
- I was just dropping these off.

167
00:09:31,921 --> 00:09:36,255
Now, if you'll excuse me, they're
putting me in something called Hero Squad.

168
00:09:36,359 --> 00:09:39,590
You have no idea what it's like
to be abandoned by your son.

169
00:09:39,696 --> 00:09:42,187
Do you see my son?
He chose his girlfriend over me.

170
00:09:42,298 --> 00:09:46,928
How the worm has turned.
Look who feels the sting of an ungrateful child.

171
00:09:47,036 --> 00:09:49,630
Mother, you have
to receive something to be ungrateful.

172
00:09:49,739 --> 00:09:52,708
I'm not gettin' worked up over it tonight.
I'm not gonna let anything bother me.

173
00:09:52,809 --> 00:09:58,247
Good. I'll get a drink and then go home
and wait for you to come stay with me.

174
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,942
Thank God they've got my brands here.

175
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,984
<i>This was an unacceptable solution.</i>

176
00:10:03,086 --> 00:10:08,956
Hey, Tobias, it's Michael. I hope you get this.
I need you to go over to my mother's tonight.

177
00:10:09,058 --> 00:10:11,288
<i>Unfortunately, Tobias missed the call...</i>

178
00:10:11,394 --> 00:10:13,294
<i>and it went through
to Michael's home voice mail.</i>

179
00:10:13,396 --> 00:10:15,626
The Blue Men!

180
00:10:15,732 --> 00:10:19,133
<i>You have
101 unheard messages. First message.</i>

181
00:10:19,235 --> 00:10:22,204
- Michael, it's your mother-
- Michael, pick up.

182
00:10:22,305 --> 00:10:24,296
Happy Thanksgiving- Michael, it's Mother-

183
00:10:24,407 --> 00:10:26,307
Michael, pick up-

184
00:10:26,409 --> 00:10:29,867
- Hey, Tobias, it's Michael.
- Bluth Company.

185
00:10:32,015 --> 00:10:34,415
<i>And Lindsay showed up
at the Christmas party.</i>

186
00:10:34,517 --> 00:10:38,977
<i>Unfortunately, she didn't realize the employees
had been threatened against flirting.</i>

187
00:10:39,088 --> 00:10:43,491
Oh, hello, Ted. Oh, if you're worried
about my husband, it's fine.

188
00:10:43,593 --> 00:10:48,155
He's no bigger than a Cub Scout. You could
take him, and you could certainly take me.

189
00:10:48,264 --> 00:10:51,995
This has been pleasant and professional.
Good luck in the coming business year.

190
00:10:55,972 --> 00:11:00,432
Hey, you guys are
sticking stuff on Gob's suit?
- Shh.

191
00:11:00,543 --> 00:11:03,239
Go away.
You're gonna ruin it.

192
00:11:04,614 --> 00:11:06,912
Aunt Lindsay,
how's the party?

193
00:11:07,016 --> 00:11:09,507
It is the worst Christmas party
I've ever been to in my life.

194
00:11:09,619 --> 00:11:12,213
Yeah. Watch this.

195
00:11:12,322 --> 00:11:16,190
Yep. Like my last 10 years. And my daughter
won't give me the time of day.

196
00:11:16,292 --> 00:11:18,852
- How was your party?
- Oh, it was good.

197
00:11:18,962 --> 00:11:23,023
They're kind of religious,
Ann's family, so it was-

198
00:11:23,132 --> 00:11:25,623
Yeah, it was just kind of-

199
00:11:25,735 --> 00:11:29,262
<i>The word George Michael
was searching for was "creepy."</i>

200
00:11:39,215 --> 00:11:42,116
Let me give you a hand
with that, little fella.

201
00:11:48,258 --> 00:11:51,386
Hey, I was talkin' to the sound guy,
and he said he's got this karaoke thing.

202
00:11:51,494 --> 00:11:54,088
- Yeah. Let's do it. Put the first song on in the book.
- Okay.

203
00:11:54,197 --> 00:11:57,064
Okay? Thanks very much.
Hey. I thought you were at your party.

204
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,760
No, no. They said I could leave
for the second hour of silent prayer.

205
00:11:59,869 --> 00:12:03,635
But Ann and I do have to go back,
so I should- I should go soon.

206
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,799
- Uncle Michael-
- Okay. I'll be right there.

207
00:12:05,909 --> 00:12:09,401
Sorry. I gotta go do this.
I'll be right back.

208
00:12:09,512 --> 00:12:12,970
<i>And Michael
sang a duet with his niece.</i>

209
00:12:16,219 --> 00:12:18,813
My daughter doesn't need me.

210
00:12:18,922 --> 00:12:20,981
Neither does my dad.

211
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:24,389
<i>Had George Michael
and Lindsay stayed, they might have discovered...</i>

212
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:29,955
<i>what Michael and Maeby did- that
"Afternoon Delight"was more adult-themed...</i>

213
00:12:30,066 --> 00:12:32,261
<i>than its innocent melody
would have you believe.</i>

214
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:41,768
- Hang on, Maeby.

215
00:12:41,878 --> 00:12:45,644
Listen. I'm gonna
go get some more punch, because it is toast time.

216
00:12:45,748 --> 00:12:50,151
<i>Okay? No, no, no.
It'll look worse. Go that way.</i>

217
00:12:50,253 --> 00:12:53,279
So, let's toast me.
Who's first?

218
00:12:53,389 --> 00:12:58,952
Huh. Tom, why don't you come up here
and talk about me for a few minutes?

219
00:12:59,062 --> 00:13:02,293
Uh, I wanna thank
the Bluth family for hiring me back.

220
00:13:02,398 --> 00:13:04,628
It's been a tough couple years.

221
00:13:04,734 --> 00:13:07,464
<i>- My brother did that. Talk about me.
- Oh, okay.</i>

222
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:11,131
Uh, you certainly
do love those suits.

223
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,836
<i>At seven grand, you'd better believe I love 'em.
I mean, look at what you're wearing.</i>

224
00:13:15,945 --> 00:13:19,346
You look like crap.
I mean, at least this is-

225
00:13:19,449 --> 00:13:21,747
Who did this?

226
00:13:21,851 --> 00:13:24,319
You do this, Tom?

227
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:27,981
- No.
- You're a real smart-ass. You know that, Tom?

228
00:13:28,091 --> 00:13:30,025
Look, I don't know him very well...

229
00:13:30,126 --> 00:13:34,187
but Gob seems like
he'd be a really smart boss.

230
00:13:34,297 --> 00:13:36,822
Please don't laugh.

231
00:13:36,933 --> 00:13:40,494
Look, he's a great magician.

232
00:13:40,603 --> 00:13:44,039
<i>- That's even better!
- you, Tom.</i>

233
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,267
- Please don't.
- You know what? You're fired.

234
00:13:46,376 --> 00:13:50,608
No. You're all fired,
each and every one of you.

235
00:13:50,713 --> 00:13:53,079
Merry Christmas.

236
00:13:53,182 --> 00:13:56,379
I didn't know the lyrics.
Where's everybody goin'?

237
00:13:56,486 --> 00:13:58,511
- We don't work here anymore.
- What?

238
00:13:58,621 --> 00:14:01,590
Is your sister still around?

239
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:08,497
<i>The Christmas party had been a disaster.</i>

240
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:13,093
I did the right thing, Michael. If I don't
fire them, how do I teach a lesson to the others?

241
00:14:13,204 --> 00:14:18,608
- There are no others. You fired everyone.
- Oh, that- that's great.

242
00:14:18,709 --> 00:14:23,203
The guy who's dirty dancing with his niece
is gonna tell the guy in the $3,600 suit...

243
00:14:23,314 --> 00:14:25,748
how to run the business.

244
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:28,148
- Come on.
- I know. Maybe we're better off...

245
00:14:28,252 --> 00:14:32,814
with me being businesslike and you
being the good-time, useless party guy.

246
00:14:32,924 --> 00:14:34,892
- It got us this far.
- Mm-hmm.

247
00:14:34,992 --> 00:14:39,088
And I must say that I miss the laughter.
Oh, God, how they used to laugh with me.

248
00:14:39,196 --> 00:14:41,926
At you. We gotta figure out a way
to hire everybody back.

249
00:14:42,033 --> 00:14:43,933
- A meeting.
- A party.

250
00:14:44,035 --> 00:14:46,902
- No. We just had a party.
- Yeah, but I didn't get to have any fun.

251
00:14:47,004 --> 00:14:49,802
<i>So Michael went to work
on another Christmas party...</i>

252
00:14:49,907 --> 00:14:52,740
<i>this time with the help
ofhis niece.</i>

253
00:14:52,843 --> 00:14:55,437
<i>I appreciate you doing this.
I didn't wanna ask George Michael.</i>

254
00:14:55,546 --> 00:14:59,346
Did you see that he showed up at the party
for five minutes and left without saying good-bye?

255
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:03,079
- Hey, my mom doesn't even wanna
be in the same room with me.
- Michael...

256
00:15:03,187 --> 00:15:06,384
I was almost attacked
last night in my own home.

257
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,617
I walk in, and there's a colored man
in my kitchen.

258
00:15:08,726 --> 00:15:11,820
- "Colored"? What color was he exactly?
- Blue.

259
00:15:13,397 --> 00:15:15,262
Hello, Lucille.

260
00:15:17,134 --> 00:15:20,103
- I sent him to your house to keep you safe.
- Well, he did a terrible job.

261
00:15:20,204 --> 00:15:25,608
Didn't he? I need someone else, someone better.
What about this one? She's got thick arms.

262
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:28,838
Mom, you just need to calm down a little bit.
You're so tense.

263
00:15:28,946 --> 00:15:31,141
How am I supposed
to calm down?

264
00:15:31,248 --> 00:15:35,446
Sounds tense. That means she's not
gettin' any from my brother Oscar.

265
00:15:35,553 --> 00:15:37,748
<i>Maybe I should move in with you.</i>

266
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:40,688
<i>And Michael realized
he needed to retrieve his Uncle Oscar.</i>

267
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:43,055
How would you like
to go on a road trip?

268
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,027
No. I wanna stay here
with her. Let's go.

269
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:48,997
<i>And so the two of them
prepared to drive up the coast.</i>

270
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:52,900
You're in charge of the radio, and we're
not stopping until we find Uncle Oscar.

271
00:15:53,004 --> 00:15:56,132
There he is.

272
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:01,735
My mom is very stressed out,
and she needs something that I can't give her-

273
00:16:01,846 --> 00:16:05,304
um, maybe a little
afternoon delight.

274
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:08,647
<i>Oscar thought that Michael
was referring to a particular brand of cannabis...</i>

275
00:16:08,753 --> 00:16:13,087
<i>named Afternoon Deelite,
a strain famous for slowing behavior.</i>

276
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:16,057
<i>Well, sure. The question is...</i>

277
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,153
which way do I try
to get it in her?

278
00:16:20,264 --> 00:16:22,732
I don't need any details.

279
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:25,199
- Maybe I'll put it in her brownie.
- Hey!

280
00:16:25,302 --> 00:16:28,601
- What happened to you?
- What?

281
00:16:28,706 --> 00:16:34,201
<i>Oh, oh. My ears. The doctor said
I can't go to sleep for five hours...</i>

282
00:16:34,311 --> 00:16:37,280
or I might die or something.

283
00:16:37,381 --> 00:16:41,340
Oh, I got blown,
so I can't sleep.

284
00:16:43,154 --> 00:16:45,384
<i>Hey, have you seen Maeby?</i>

285
00:16:45,489 --> 00:16:48,617
You're not gonna believe this. Apparently
my dad and Maeby took a drive up the coast.

286
00:16:48,726 --> 00:16:52,218
<i>- You're kidding me.
- Uh-oh. I should not have picked at that.</i>

287
00:16:52,329 --> 00:16:54,422
<i>- That's blood.
- This is ridiculous.</i>

288
00:16:54,532 --> 00:16:57,262
- So she's got a new parent.
- Yeah. Now my dad's got a new kid.

289
00:16:57,368 --> 00:17:03,034
I'm gonna lie down for a little bit,
but just- I c- I can't fall-

290
00:17:05,643 --> 00:17:08,612
Hey, how would you like
to come to the party with me today?

291
00:17:08,713 --> 00:17:12,615
<i>And Oscar was giving Lucille
a little Afternoon Deelite.</i>

292
00:17:12,717 --> 00:17:16,153
- These are really delicious.
- I'll get some more.

293
00:17:16,253 --> 00:17:18,312
<i>Okay</i>

294
00:17:19,356 --> 00:17:21,756
<i>Mm-hmm</i>

295
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:24,794
Where did she go?

296
00:17:24,895 --> 00:17:28,956
<i>Soon, the second Bluth Company
Christmas party in as many days began.</i>

297
00:17:29,066 --> 00:17:32,092
- You are not fired, sir.
- I really appreciate that.

298
00:17:32,203 --> 00:17:34,569
You got it. Here you go. Merry Christmas.
Where the hell is my brother?

299
00:17:34,672 --> 00:17:37,232
<i>Sure, the guy in the $600 banana suit.</i>

300
00:17:37,341 --> 00:17:41,107
- Come on!
- Hi.

301
00:17:46,183 --> 00:17:48,447
- What the hell are you doing?
- Hey, don't be mad at me...

302
00:17:48,552 --> 00:17:50,679
'cause you didn't think
about going out to Tarzana...

303
00:17:50,788 --> 00:17:52,688
to get the old banana suit
out of storage.

304
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:56,248
<i>But it's worth it, because it's time for me
to make people laugh again.</i>

305
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,294
With me.

306
00:17:58,395 --> 00:18:02,263
And what's funnier than a guy in-
Oh- Hey, wait. Hey.

307
00:18:05,269 --> 00:18:09,228
Okay.

308
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:13,532
<i>Later, Gob was inside the banana stand...</i>

309
00:18:13,644 --> 00:18:17,842
<i>and it was getting pretty hot in there,
so he decided to lose a layer.</i>

310
00:18:17,948 --> 00:18:22,317
<i>Hey, look. There's your mom and George Michael.
I guess they did come to support us after all.</i>

311
00:18:22,419 --> 00:18:25,047
Look at that. They're all over each other
with their little secrets.

312
00:18:25,156 --> 00:18:28,148
- What can you do, right?
- Yeah.

313
00:18:28,259 --> 00:18:31,285
How would you feel
about singing a little karaoke?

314
00:18:31,395 --> 00:18:35,024
<i>Unfortunately, Lindsay wasn't there
to see all of Michael and Maeby's song...</i>

315
00:18:35,132 --> 00:18:37,498
<i>and was about
to have a similar revelation.</i>

316
00:18:37,601 --> 00:18:39,535
Could not be caught
that didn't bite

317
00:18:39,637 --> 00:18:42,800
But you got some bait
a-waitin', and I think I might

318
00:18:42,907 --> 00:18:45,398
<i>- Try nibbling a little afternoon delight
- That's my wife and nephew.</i>

319
00:18:45,509 --> 00:18:49,639
<i>- Skyrockets in flight
- We have an open relationship.</i>

320
00:18:49,747 --> 00:18:54,684
<i>Just then, Lucille arrived,
craving a frozen banana.</i>

321
00:18:54,785 --> 00:18:58,846
<i>And the effects of Lindsay and George Michael's
"Afternoon Delight"was overshadowed-</i>

322
00:18:58,956 --> 00:19:02,050
<i>- Mom?
- by the effects of Oscar
and Lucille's Afternoon Deelite.</i>

323
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:05,651
<i>- Tobias-Tobias, watch out.
- Tobias couldn't hear-</i>

324
00:19:05,763 --> 00:19:08,425
<i>- Tobias!
- and didn't manage to get out of the way in time.</i>

325
00:19:08,532 --> 00:19:10,557
What the hell was that?

326
00:19:10,668 --> 00:19:14,934
<i>And Gob couldn't move freely.
Lucille tried to stop...</i>

327
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,007
<i>but the car
hit Gob's banana peel.</i>

328
00:19:22,646 --> 00:19:24,773
I can't get out of here. I'm stuck.

329
00:19:24,882 --> 00:19:27,180
Mom, are you crazy?
You could've killed somebody.

330
00:19:27,284 --> 00:19:31,618
<i>Hey, Mikey, relax.
It's just a giant banana.</i>

331
00:19:31,722 --> 00:19:35,681
<i>And that's when Buster
saw an opportunity to be a hero.</i>

332
00:19:35,793 --> 00:19:37,886
- Gob?
- Mom, I'm stuck!

333
00:19:37,995 --> 00:19:40,896
I got you, Brother!

334
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:53,677
<i>And for the second time
since he became president...</i>

335
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:56,541
<i>Gob heard the sweet sound
oflaughter.</i>

336
00:19:56,647 --> 00:20:02,381
They're laughing with me, Michael.
They're laughing with me!

337
00:20:02,486 --> 00:20:05,819
<i>Unfortunately,
Buster's newfound skills...</i>

338
00:20:05,923 --> 00:20:09,916
<i>did not involve
lowering gently.</i>

339
00:20:10,027 --> 00:20:13,121
<i>Ooh. Oh.</i>

340
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,232
<i>Hey, it's Tobias.
Who wants to take me to the hospital?</i>

341
00:20:20,337 --> 00:20:22,931
<i>And so father and son reunited...</i>

342
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,975
<i>rebuilding the banana stand
for a second time.</i>

343
00:20:26,076 --> 00:20:29,136
<i>- Hey. Can I give you a hand?
- Hey. Yeah.</i>

344
00:20:29,246 --> 00:20:33,080
- That would be great.
- Okay.

345
00:20:33,183 --> 00:20:37,552
- Oh, I'm sorry about-
It's embarrassing, the whole-
- Listen, I, uh-

346
00:20:37,655 --> 00:20:39,987
I've been a little out of line lately.
You're entitled...

347
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:42,524
to be with your girlfriend,
and I guess I got a little bit jealous.

348
00:20:42,626 --> 00:20:45,595
- Yeah. Well, me too.
- Yeah.

349
00:20:45,696 --> 00:20:48,392
Okay.

350
00:20:54,204 --> 00:20:57,503
- Gonna grab some afternoon-
- Afternoon

351
00:20:57,608 --> 00:21:00,168
- It does not seem like it would be that dirty.
- It's- It is catchy.

352
00:21:00,277 --> 00:21:01,608
Right. That's the thing.

353
00:21:01,712 --> 00:21:04,647
<i>On the next Arrested Development.</i>

354
00:21:04,748 --> 00:21:07,876
<i>The Blue Man Group finally calls for Tobias...</i>

355
00:21:07,985 --> 00:21:11,819
<i>With a life-changing opportunity.</i>

356
00:21:11,922 --> 00:21:15,949
<i>Unfortunately, he can't hear it,
and his life stays the same.</i>
