1
00:00:00,985 --> 00:00:04,386
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:04,489 --> 00:00:06,480
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:06,591 --> 00:00:08,582
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:14,098 --> 00:00:15,759
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

5
00:00:18,036 --> 00:00:21,597
<i>Michael Bluth arrived home
to find his mother, Lucille...</i>

6
00:00:21,706 --> 00:00:24,869
<i>- in a state of agitation.
- I think the company's in trouble.</i>

7
00:00:24,976 --> 00:00:27,342
What tipped you?
The falling profits...

8
00:00:27,445 --> 00:00:30,505
or that we're a regular feature on Bill O'Reilly's
"Most Ridiculous Item of the Day"?

9
00:00:30,615 --> 00:00:35,177
I'm talking about the fact that my "friend"
Lucille Austero bought our company...

10
00:00:35,286 --> 00:00:38,585
<i>and I think she's going for
a power grab, that bitch!</i>

11
00:00:38,689 --> 00:00:41,123
You're not at home, Mom.
She doesn't live next door when you're here.

12
00:00:41,225 --> 00:00:44,524
Secondly, she's already grabbed power.
She's the majority shareholder of the company.

13
00:00:44,629 --> 00:00:48,030
Your brother Gob.

14
00:00:48,132 --> 00:00:51,431
<i>In fact, Lucille 2
was already with Gob-
- You look really nice.</i>

15
00:00:51,536 --> 00:00:54,369
<i>- but she was growing tired ofhis neediness.
- Where are you going?</i>

16
00:00:54,472 --> 00:00:56,372
I'm going to my spin class.

17
00:00:56,474 --> 00:00:58,374
Thought you had vertigo.

18
00:00:58,476 --> 00:01:01,570
<i>She'll sell the company or break it up
into little parts or something...</i>

19
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:04,944
all under the guise of
"caring" about our family.

20
00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:09,042
Gotta stop quoting when you drink.
I certainly hope she's not planning a move.

21
00:01:09,153 --> 00:01:13,419
I wouldn't put it past her.
She'd love to get at me any way she could.

22
00:01:13,524 --> 00:01:15,424
That's why she's been
flirting with Gob.

23
00:01:15,526 --> 00:01:19,121
She's trying to prove that she's closer
to my children than I am...

24
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:22,722
but the joke's on her, because she doesn't know
how little I care for Gob.

25
00:01:22,834 --> 00:01:26,065
Think that makes the joke on Gob.

26
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,104
<i>- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, buddy.</i>

27
00:01:28,206 --> 00:01:30,106
Was that Gangy who was just-

28
00:01:30,208 --> 00:01:34,008
You all right? Sorry.
Your grandmother had a little accident here.

29
00:01:34,112 --> 00:01:36,842
Oh. Does that mean she's gonna
have to come live with us?

30
00:01:36,948 --> 00:01:40,816
No, no. No. It was- It was her drink,
and even if it wasn't, just-

31
00:01:40,918 --> 00:01:43,887
Do you remember when I bid on Sally Sitwell
at the bachelorette auction?

32
00:01:43,988 --> 00:01:47,617
They sent me this basket with all this stuff
for our date, you know. It's a whole package.

33
00:01:47,725 --> 00:01:50,694
I thought that maybe we could do it
together, like a Valentine's present.

34
00:01:50,795 --> 00:01:53,025
- You're not gonna take Sally?
- Sally, no. No.

35
00:01:53,131 --> 00:01:55,531
L-I wanted it for us.
I never wanted to be with Sally.

36
00:01:55,633 --> 00:01:58,602
<i>Actually, Michael
had gone over to Sitwell Enterprises-</i>

37
00:01:58,703 --> 00:02:02,867
<i>- Michael Bluth to see Sally.
- one day earlier to set up a date with Sally.</i>

38
00:02:02,974 --> 00:02:07,308
I'm afraid she's not here. If you'd like me
to take the package, I can give it to her.

39
00:02:09,113 --> 00:02:12,640
No, no. This is, uh-
This is not for her. It's for my son.

40
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,116
Just don't tell her I came by.

41
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:17,483
<i>In fact, Sally wasn't there...</i>

42
00:02:17,588 --> 00:02:19,886
<i>and the person Michael saw
was her father.</i>

43
00:02:19,991 --> 00:02:23,552
<i>- You kidding? This makes me
look like my daughter.
- No one's going to think that.</i>

44
00:02:23,661 --> 00:02:26,596
I look like Edgar Winter.
Forget it. I gotta get to spin class.

45
00:02:26,697 --> 00:02:30,030
<i>So what do you say?
We got a basketful of father-son fun here.</i>

46
00:02:30,134 --> 00:02:33,797
- What's Kama Sutra oil?
- Maybe it's not for us.

47
00:02:33,905 --> 00:02:37,136
<i>Ah, Valentine's Day, which-</i>

48
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:39,209
Oh! Was your mother here?

49
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:42,006
Here. You all right?
I'll help you up.

50
00:02:42,113 --> 00:02:45,207
Oh, that is quite a basket
you've got there, Michael.

51
00:02:45,316 --> 00:02:47,409
That Sally Sitwell
is one lucky lady.

52
00:02:47,518 --> 00:02:51,249
Well, I'm- I'm not so sure that she's actually...
right for me, anyway.

53
00:02:51,355 --> 00:02:55,155
But you got one of these too, didn't you?
Y-You bought Lindsay at the same auction.

54
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:58,751
Well, yes, but I'm afraid
I prematurely shot my wad...

55
00:02:58,863 --> 00:03:00,990
on what was supposed to be
a dry run, if you will.

56
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:04,158
So now I'm afraid I have
something of a mess on my hands.

57
00:03:04,268 --> 00:03:07,169
It's just-There's so many
poorly chosen words in that sentence.

58
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:10,934
<i>Tobias wanted to make sure
that everything was perfect for Lindsay...</i>

59
00:03:11,042 --> 00:03:14,170
<i>so he went to check it out first.</i>

60
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:16,678
Oh. Body chocolate.

61
00:03:18,716 --> 00:03:23,050
- It's a wonderful package. I'll take it.
- You just did.

62
00:03:23,154 --> 00:03:25,884
<i>Why don't you take this?
I don't have anyone to go with anyway.</i>

63
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,458
Can you imagine
how jealous that would make her?

64
00:03:28,559 --> 00:03:30,493
"Where's Tobias?"

65
00:03:30,595 --> 00:03:34,156
"Oh, he's just sharing
a romantic horseback ride with Michael Bluth...

66
00:03:34,265 --> 00:03:36,426
and they're dipping each other in"-

67
00:03:36,534 --> 00:03:40,436
- Oh, you didn't get any body chocolate.
- L-I didn't mean with me.

68
00:03:40,538 --> 00:03:44,372
L-I hate to see you struggle like this.
In fact, why don't you let me ask her for you?

69
00:03:44,475 --> 00:03:48,036
Well, Michael, you really are
quite the Cupid, aren't you?

70
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:52,104
I tell you, you can zing your
arrow into my buttocks anytime.

71
00:03:52,216 --> 00:03:55,982
Okay. You know what you do? Buy yourself a
tape recorder. Record yourself for a whole day.

72
00:03:56,087 --> 00:03:58,817
I think you're gonna be surprised
at some of your phrasing.

73
00:03:58,923 --> 00:04:01,824
Butterscotch! Want a lick?

74
00:04:01,926 --> 00:04:05,362
<i>And later, Lindsay
stopped by the office at Michael's request.</i>

75
00:04:05,463 --> 00:04:09,991
Great. Thank you. Listen. I want you to take...
my romance package at the Four Seas Hotel.

76
00:04:10,101 --> 00:04:12,661
- Oh, yea!
- That's great. Tobias is gonna be thrilled.

77
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:16,399
- Oh. I have to go with Tobias?
- Lindsay, your husband really wants this to work.

78
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:19,965
- Come on. Let me play Cupid this year.
- I thought he went already.

79
00:04:20,077 --> 00:04:24,514
- I'm giving you mine.
- Because you're afraid to ask
Sally Sitwell to go with you.

80
00:04:24,615 --> 00:04:28,073
That's not true at all.
- Mmm?
Chaw-chee-chaw, chee-chaw.

81
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:30,449
- What is that? Is that a chicken?
- What's this?

82
00:04:30,554 --> 00:04:32,988
- Oh. Michael's scared to ask out Sally.
- No, I'm not.

83
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:36,821
- Chaw-chee-chaw-
- This is priceless.

84
00:04:36,927 --> 00:04:40,419
You too. This is great. Come on.
These aren't even birds.

85
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:43,091
I am not-That's enough.
There are people working.

86
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,862
Listen, I think that Lucille 2
is up to something.

87
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:49,701
Mom said the same thing. I thought she was
ticked off'cause you're seeing her.

88
00:04:49,807 --> 00:04:52,332
What? You're seeing Lucille 2?
Does Buster know?

89
00:04:52,443 --> 00:04:56,174
No. And I'm not.
Just don't tell people-

90
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,046
I'm playing the part of the gigolo
so that she'll keep the company afloat.

91
00:05:00,151 --> 00:05:03,780
But something weird happened yesterday
when I was trying to find a way out of there.

92
00:05:07,925 --> 00:05:09,825
Hello?

93
00:05:09,927 --> 00:05:13,829
<i>In fact, it was Stan Sitwell calling her...</i>

94
00:05:13,931 --> 00:05:16,798
<i>as he'd become quite taken
with Lucille 2 himself.</i>

95
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:19,631
It all makes sense.
Why else would Sally Sitwell be avoiding me?

96
00:05:19,737 --> 00:05:23,639
- She thinks you're a loser.
- And why would Lucille 2
be so distant toward me?

97
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:26,403
- 'Cause she knows you're a loser.
- I think it's pretty clear.

98
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,910
Lucille 2 and Sitwell
are working on a business deal.

99
00:05:29,013 --> 00:05:31,948
Lindsay, I'd like for you to go over
to Sitwell and see what you can find out.

100
00:05:32,049 --> 00:05:34,176
- I can't go there again.
- Why do I have to do that?

101
00:05:34,285 --> 00:05:36,879
Because you've been helping yourself
to the company money for some time.

102
00:05:36,987 --> 00:05:39,478
It's not like you do anything
for the family anyway.

103
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,524
Gob doesn't do anything
for the family.

104
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:44,059
Hey, I'm-
Lucille 2.

105
00:05:44,161 --> 00:05:46,254
Oh. I could do
something like that.

106
00:05:46,364 --> 00:05:49,765
<i>This is what Dad was really good at-
getting us out of tight spots.</i>

107
00:05:49,867 --> 00:05:54,201
<i>In fact, at that very moment,
George Sr. was in a tight spot...</i>

108
00:05:54,305 --> 00:05:56,933
<i>as he'd gotten himself
wedged under the furnace...</i>

109
00:05:57,041 --> 00:06:00,636
<i>while chasing after a sour ball
that had rolled out ofhis pocket.</i>

110
00:06:04,648 --> 00:06:06,616
<i>Eventually, Michael rescued him.</i>

111
00:06:06,717 --> 00:06:08,844
<i>I'm starting to worry
she's gonna sell us out.</i>

112
00:06:08,953 --> 00:06:12,286
I think the answer
to this problem is money.

113
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:16,622
Now, this may just be me having my head against
a hundred-degree furnace for an hour...

114
00:06:16,727 --> 00:06:19,252
but maybe we should
bring in Jack Dorso.

115
00:06:19,363 --> 00:06:23,925
- UncleJack?
- Well, no. He's not my uncle.
He's, uh, my dad's friend.

116
00:06:24,034 --> 00:06:26,298
But, uh, this guy
has got a fortune.

117
00:06:26,404 --> 00:06:29,396
<i>Jack Dorso
first achieved success in the '40s...</i>

118
00:06:29,507 --> 00:06:33,409
<i>as a costar of the radio and then film serial,
- Nazi Hunters.</i>

119
00:06:34,512 --> 00:06:36,412
<i>There are two Nazis
up there in that dance hall.</i>

120
00:06:36,514 --> 00:06:38,448
<i>Shoot me.</i>

121
00:06:38,549 --> 00:06:41,074
Happy Valentine's Day, Nazis.

122
00:06:41,185 --> 00:06:43,779
<i>When the actor
who played Red McGibbon...</i>

123
00:06:43,888 --> 00:06:46,686
<i>was jailed for his
Communist sympathies...</i>

124
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:50,591
<i>Jack Dorso made one attempt
at a solo Bullet feature.</i>

125
00:06:50,694 --> 00:06:54,926
<i>But the audience was not ready
to accept Bullet as a romantic lead...</i>

126
00:06:55,032 --> 00:06:57,899
<i>despite his powerful upper body.</i>

127
00:06:58,002 --> 00:06:59,902
<i>So he started
a chain of gymnasiums...</i>

128
00:07:00,004 --> 00:07:03,735
<i>having stolen the idea
from Red during a prison visit.</i>

129
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:06,366
<i>- And as the years passed-
- Hey, Jack!</i>

130
00:07:06,477 --> 00:07:10,937
<i>He became well-known
for his annual birthday feats of strength.</i>

131
00:07:11,048 --> 00:07:14,074
Five pounds for each year of my life.

132
00:07:14,185 --> 00:07:17,245
<i>Sadly, he lost the use
ofhis legs on his 70th birthday-</i>

133
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:21,757
<i>- Release!
- at the newly-remodeled Jack Dorso's
in Albany, New York.</i>

134
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:24,623
Too much!

135
00:07:26,497 --> 00:07:29,125
If he's got so much money,
how come we never called him before?

136
00:07:29,233 --> 00:07:31,895
But I have. I mean, there wouldn't be
a Bluth Company without him.

137
00:07:32,002 --> 00:07:34,334
I could never have afforded
that first tract of land.

138
00:07:34,438 --> 00:07:36,338
But he always wants
something in return.

139
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,340
I don't know.

140
00:07:38,442 --> 00:07:42,276
See if you can talk your mother into
taking another bullet for the Bluth family.

141
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:51,343
<i>The family gathered at Lucille's
to welcome and solicit UncleJack.</i>

142
00:07:51,454 --> 00:07:53,445
<i>And remember,
he wasn't really their uncle.</i>

143
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:57,356
Buster. Nice of you to take a break
from that common whore you've been dating.

144
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:01,988
She is not a whore, Mother. She happens to
be the new secretary of the Bluth Company.

145
00:08:02,098 --> 00:08:06,660
<i>And, yes, she's more experienced
than a normal girl.</i>

146
00:08:06,769 --> 00:08:11,297
<i>- But sometimes love should be terrifying.
- In fact...</i>

147
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:14,342
<i>Buster had even started
using his army stealth training.
- Buster.</i>

148
00:08:14,444 --> 00:08:18,039
I'll be right in, and then
maybe we can talk about-

149
00:08:18,147 --> 00:08:21,275
Makin' that love.

150
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:29,490
<i>I shouldn't complain. It's better than
you dating Lucille 2, that bitch!</i>

151
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:33,824
<i>Lucille 2's not a "B,"Mother.
She's kind, and she's caring...</i>

152
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,832
<i>and she's certainly less experienced
than that whore that I'm dating now.</i>

153
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,300
<i>And perhaps it was
screaming it out loud...</i>

154
00:08:40,403 --> 00:08:42,496
<i>that made Buster realize
that he missed Lucille 2.</i>

155
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:45,904
<i>I'm wondering if you can keep
some of the more piercing profanities down...</i>

156
00:08:46,009 --> 00:08:47,909
when the 90-year-old
fitness buff gets here?

157
00:08:48,011 --> 00:08:50,741
You know, Michael, I was happy
to call UncleJack for you...

158
00:08:50,847 --> 00:08:53,179
but that's as much
as I'm going to do.

159
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,183
If you know what I mean.

160
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:57,753
I need a more vital man.

161
00:08:57,854 --> 00:09:00,982
<i>Someone order 140 pounds
of upper-body strength?</i>

162
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:04,218
Well, he certainly
sounds vital to me.

163
00:09:04,327 --> 00:09:06,795
<i>Walk, Dragon! Walk!</i>

164
00:09:06,896 --> 00:09:09,364
<i>- Enter the room!
- Welcome, UncleJack.</i>

165
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:13,492
He's half deaf.
It was a stupid, stupid hire.

166
00:09:13,603 --> 00:09:17,266
Not "higher."
Eye level! Eye level!

167
00:09:17,373 --> 00:09:20,240
Kisses, and then we talk.
Which one is Michael?

168
00:09:20,343 --> 00:09:22,538
- Uh-
- Swoop me!

169
00:09:24,247 --> 00:09:27,444
<i>Oh.
- I, uh, really appreciate
you coming over, UncleJack.</i>

170
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:30,280
Thank you for having me.
You may be amazed.

171
00:09:30,386 --> 00:09:34,117
Uh, I'm invited into
very few personal homes.

172
00:09:34,223 --> 00:09:36,123
To the nuts!

173
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,393
The bridge mix!
The bridge mix! Fool!

174
00:09:41,698 --> 00:09:43,563
Hey, fake UncleJack.

175
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:47,966
Is this the boy? Is this the little one?
My God, you're an army man.

176
00:09:48,071 --> 00:09:51,370
- Well-
- I was never in the army. I was in the pictures.

177
00:09:51,474 --> 00:09:54,272
Here comes UncleJack. Shoot me!

178
00:09:54,377 --> 00:09:56,937
Oh, God!

179
00:09:57,046 --> 00:10:00,777
Look at that. I pinned him. I pinned the army man.

180
00:10:00,883 --> 00:10:05,286
God bless you for being in the army.
Up, Dragon!

181
00:10:05,388 --> 00:10:10,758
Lift. Lift with vigor.

182
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:15,354
<i>- Remember me?
- Lucille. You look younger
than you did the day l-</i>

183
00:10:15,465 --> 00:10:19,299
Oh, you old fool. I'm Lucille.

184
00:10:19,402 --> 00:10:24,203
You look fabulous.
Back to the blonde. Back to the blonde.

185
00:10:25,408 --> 00:10:28,536
Isn't she beautiful? Oh, yeah.

186
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,438
He's kind of scary, that guy, huh?

187
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,948
Not to me.
I think he's kind of cool.

188
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,679
Well, why don't you go get your kiss
from Mr. Cool Half-Man?

189
00:10:37,787 --> 00:10:39,687
- I'd be fine with that.
- Let's go.

190
00:10:39,789 --> 00:10:41,620
- So what's your point?
- Come on.

191
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,988
Why, she's no bigger
than one of my legs.

192
00:10:44,093 --> 00:10:46,891
Shake them for her.

193
00:10:46,996 --> 00:10:49,123
Excuse me, UncleJack.
I'm George Michael.

194
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,723
It's okay. Just ignore it!

195
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:55,463
Ignore it. Just something the body does
when you're shaken.

196
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:57,368
<i>Don't shake it!
Don't shake it!</i>

197
00:10:57,473 --> 00:10:59,373
- Towel!
- Not the good ones!

198
00:10:59,475 --> 00:11:02,376
Is he dying? What if he's dying?

199
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,374
Boy, that Dragon's cute, huh?

200
00:11:06,482 --> 00:11:08,541
What, the deaf giant
who's holding our fake uncle?

201
00:11:08,651 --> 00:11:10,846
He's been flirting
with me all night.

202
00:11:10,953 --> 00:11:13,513
I was thinking maybe it would
be best for the family...

203
00:11:13,623 --> 00:11:17,218
if I went on that romance thing
with Drag instead ofTobias...

204
00:11:17,326 --> 00:11:19,260
<i>which would be a drag.</i>

205
00:11:19,362 --> 00:11:22,525
Yeah, that's just the kind of joke Drag can't hear.

206
00:11:22,632 --> 00:11:26,898
No, you're gonna go with Tobias or not at all.
Now tell me what you found out at Sitwell.

207
00:11:27,003 --> 00:11:29,403
- Oh. You still want me to do that?
- You didn't?

208
00:11:29,505 --> 00:11:32,736
Lindsay, I give you one thing to do
for the business, and you can't even do it.

209
00:11:32,842 --> 00:11:35,834
I mean, if you'd tried and failed,
I'd understand, but you didn't even try.

210
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:39,745
So, I didn't even fail, and I don't see you
giving me credit for that.

211
00:11:39,849 --> 00:11:43,512
<i>Michael knew
that since Lindsay let him down...</i>

212
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:49,285
<i>he had no choice but to ask UncleJack
for the money to save his company.</i>

213
00:11:49,392 --> 00:11:51,986
- Pretty.
- Yes.

214
00:11:52,095 --> 00:11:56,225
Do you think you should be perched
on the edge of the building like this?

215
00:11:56,332 --> 00:11:58,766
Oh, Dragon's got me.

216
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,332
- Dragon's in the bathroom.
- Mama!

217
00:12:03,439 --> 00:12:07,034
Come on. I got ya. I got ya. It's okay.

218
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:10,874
<i>And so Michael laid out his dilemma.
...family company get ruined.</i>

219
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:15,815
- I was hoping that this was a social visit-
- Well-

220
00:12:15,918 --> 00:12:20,446
particularly when that sister of yours
started giving me the cutie eye.

221
00:12:20,556 --> 00:12:22,251
She did?

222
00:12:22,358 --> 00:12:27,523
Unfortunately that moose was holding me,
so I couldn't make my move.

223
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:32,226
Of course I couldn't make that move
without that moose, but that's my challenge.

224
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,997
I won't go wheelchair!

225
00:12:35,104 --> 00:12:37,072
Twirl me around.

226
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:42,136
Hey, hey. No.
I got you. I got you.

227
00:12:42,245 --> 00:12:44,304
You all right?

228
00:12:44,413 --> 00:12:48,372
But Valentine's Day is here,
and I'm alone.

229
00:12:48,484 --> 00:12:50,418
The moose is no one.

230
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,183
Perhaps if I had
a little... companionship...

231
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:58,226
I'd be a little more
disposed to whip out...

232
00:12:58,327 --> 00:13:01,091
that old wallet of mine.

233
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,825
You're saying if I were
to set you up with my sister...

234
00:13:03,933 --> 00:13:07,425
- you would consider bailing us out?
- Oh, joy. Yeah.

235
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,437
<i>Michael was torn.</i>

236
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:12,474
<i>- The business meant the world
to him, but his sister's honor-
- Let's do it.</i>

237
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:15,271
<i>- uh, meant a lot too.
- Let's go share the good news.</i>

238
00:13:20,547 --> 00:13:23,812
<i>Michael had offered his sister
to his UncleJack...</i>

239
00:13:23,917 --> 00:13:26,317
<i>in exchange for money
to save the company.</i>

240
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,820
<i>Remember, it's not their real uncle.</i>

241
00:13:28,922 --> 00:13:32,858
- He's cute, isn't he?
- So cute.

242
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,292
- Imagine him without that muscly
little old guy in his arms.
- Oh, Dragon. Right.

243
00:13:36,396 --> 00:13:40,628
Well, that's why I was thinking maybe you
should go with Dragon on that romantic getaway.

244
00:13:40,734 --> 00:13:43,134
- Oh.
- Now, I know he's working...

245
00:13:43,236 --> 00:13:45,466
so UncleJack's
gonna have to go along.

246
00:13:45,572 --> 00:13:48,200
Oh. Well, as long as
he promises not to shake him.

247
00:13:48,308 --> 00:13:50,299
- Mmm.
- So, what did he say about the money?

248
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:53,846
He said he'd like to sleep on it.

249
00:13:53,947 --> 00:13:58,008
<i>Meanwhile,
Buster had decided to pursue a new girlfriend:</i>

250
00:13:58,118 --> 00:14:00,018
<i>His old girlfriend.</i>

251
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,486
Hey- Brother?
What are you doing here?

252
00:14:02,589 --> 00:14:05,251
I'm keeping an eye on the woman
who controls our company.

253
00:14:05,359 --> 00:14:07,327
In her robe and slippies?

254
00:14:07,427 --> 00:14:12,057
Getting into her head. I think she's planning
on selling our company to Stan Sitwell.

255
00:14:12,165 --> 00:14:15,999
But I've lost her trail, and I don't think
I have the skills to pick it up.

256
00:14:16,103 --> 00:14:18,731
Skills?

257
00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:24,609
These kind of skills?

258
00:14:24,711 --> 00:14:27,339
Not really.

259
00:14:27,447 --> 00:14:31,543
But if you give me one of those outfits,
we can hide in the bushes and spy on them.

260
00:14:32,753 --> 00:14:35,916
I would like to see her again.
You've got it.

261
00:14:36,022 --> 00:14:39,788
<i>And Michael told his father
the good news about UncleJack.</i>

262
00:14:39,926 --> 00:14:43,089
- You are pimping out your sister?
- You were pimping out my mother.

263
00:14:43,196 --> 00:14:46,597
Yes, because she was
sleeping with my brother, but your sister?

264
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,362
Everything's gonna be fine.
No one's gonna get hurt.

265
00:14:49,469 --> 00:14:51,630
No one is going to get hurt.

266
00:14:51,738 --> 00:14:55,902
<i>Oh. Hey, Michael. My dad wanted me
to thank you for the romantic getaway.</i>

267
00:14:56,009 --> 00:14:58,034
Don't tell me what that means.

268
00:14:58,145 --> 00:15:01,205
- Where is your dad?
- He left, dressed all western-y.

269
00:15:01,314 --> 00:15:03,214
You could leave me
out of that part too.

270
00:15:03,316 --> 00:15:06,547
<i>And Michael realized
that perhaps somebody would get hurt.</i>

271
00:15:06,653 --> 00:15:10,749
- I just screwed my brother-in-law.
- Well, I'm all grown up now.

272
00:15:10,857 --> 00:15:13,417
<i>So Michael rushed
to the Four Seas Hotel...</i>

273
00:15:13,527 --> 00:15:16,655
<i>to keep Tobias from finding out
about Lindsay's date.</i>

274
00:15:16,763 --> 00:15:19,891
Michael, this is Jeff.
He does all the horse work here.

275
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,798
You'll meet him again at the end.
Plus, he gets you your juice.

276
00:15:22,903 --> 00:15:25,667
Not your first juice,
but the one you get at the spa.

277
00:15:25,772 --> 00:15:29,230
- That's right. You've done this before.
- But not with a lovely lady.

278
00:15:29,342 --> 00:15:33,574
Jeff doubts one's coming at all,
don't you? Sorry. Sorry.

279
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,114
About the lovely lady-

280
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:40,046
Stop. You dropped the boot.
Dropped the boot.

281
00:15:41,755 --> 00:15:45,418
<i>Michael came up with
the only evasion he could think of.</i>

282
00:15:45,525 --> 00:15:48,551
<i>Tobias, the lovely lady, she's gonna be
a little bit late. She's doing some work.</i>

283
00:15:48,662 --> 00:15:50,562
She said to get started without her.

284
00:15:50,664 --> 00:15:54,100
- Saddle me up, Jeff.
- It's gonna take a few minutes
to tack another horse.

285
00:15:54,201 --> 00:15:59,366
<i>So Michael embarked on
the romantic adventure he'd spent so lavishly for.</i>

286
00:15:59,473 --> 00:16:03,204
Well, you certainly didn't help
with my reputation as a lady's man with Jeff.

287
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:06,040
<i>But we'll clear all that up in the spa
when I get my facial.</i>

288
00:16:06,146 --> 00:16:08,546
Hey, did you ever get
that tape recorder?

289
00:16:08,648 --> 00:16:12,744
You're funny.
Come on, boy. Hoo-cha-cha!

290
00:16:12,853 --> 00:16:16,516
<i>Soon the next group
began their romantic date.</i>

291
00:16:16,623 --> 00:16:19,319
- So nice of you to cover this, UncleJack.
- My pleasure.

292
00:16:19,426 --> 00:16:21,621
It's nice to do something
you don't need legs for.

293
00:16:27,801 --> 00:16:30,895
Towel!

294
00:16:31,004 --> 00:16:34,496
<i>And Lucille 2
showed up with Stan Sitwell...</i>

295
00:16:34,608 --> 00:16:37,168
<i>who did look a little
like Edgar Winter.</i>

296
00:16:37,277 --> 00:16:43,182
<i>And one by one, they each enjoyed
the activities of their romantic getaways.</i>

297
00:16:43,283 --> 00:16:45,547
- Body chocolate?
- No.

298
00:16:45,652 --> 00:16:47,643
<i>Of course, in the spa...</i>

299
00:16:47,754 --> 00:16:52,714
<i>thejets proved too powerful
for UncleJack's tiny legs.</i>

300
00:16:52,826 --> 00:16:57,729
<i>The spa portion also proved challenging
to Stan Sitwell and Lucille 2...</i>

301
00:16:57,831 --> 00:17:00,595
<i>who in turn
were being followed by Buster...</i>

302
00:17:02,502 --> 00:17:04,561
<i>and Gob.</i>

303
00:17:06,106 --> 00:17:08,700
<i>And soon, Michael and Tobias
awaited their massage therapists.</i>

304
00:17:08,808 --> 00:17:10,867
So, uh, Tobias...

305
00:17:10,977 --> 00:17:15,175
I'm afraid that your wife
might not actually end up here with you.

306
00:17:15,282 --> 00:17:19,013
<i>You know, Michael, perhaps
I should buy you that tape recorder.</i>

307
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,917
Do you have any idea how often
you say the word "afraid"?

308
00:17:22,022 --> 00:17:24,013
Well, I know I used it
in theJacuzzi.

309
00:17:24,124 --> 00:17:27,059
And I apologize for that.
I thought it was a pool toy.

310
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,924
<i>But you were supposed
to be here with Sally Sitwell...</i>

311
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:32,760
but... you were afraid
to ask her.

312
00:17:32,866 --> 00:17:36,700
So what do you do? You create issues,
and you make up imaginary problems...

313
00:17:36,803 --> 00:17:39,931
like this merger
I hear you're worried about.

314
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,235
Well, uh, you're probably right-

315
00:17:42,342 --> 00:17:45,971
About me being afraid of the word "No," but-

316
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:48,513
You know, the merger's real.
I'm not imagining that.

317
00:17:48,615 --> 00:17:51,049
Lucille! Michael.

318
00:17:51,151 --> 00:17:53,551
- Michael?
- What are you doing here?

319
00:17:53,653 --> 00:17:56,383
Following Lucille 2.
She's with Sitwell.

320
00:17:56,489 --> 00:17:58,923
She probably figured
that we'd never track her.

321
00:17:59,025 --> 00:18:02,426
But we lost her.
Everyone put on white robes and outsmarted us.

322
00:18:02,529 --> 00:18:05,464
Lucille! Lindsay?

323
00:18:05,565 --> 00:18:08,227
Lindsay.

324
00:18:08,335 --> 00:18:11,395
Wait, wait, wait.
Lindsay's here? With two men?

325
00:18:11,504 --> 00:18:13,404
Sort of one and a half.

326
00:18:13,506 --> 00:18:15,974
Tobias. Hey, Tobias!

327
00:18:17,377 --> 00:18:20,278
Lindsay, look. L- Oh.
Lucille 2. I'm sorry.

328
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,348
<i>- And, miss, I don't know your name.
- Tobias?</i>

329
00:18:22,449 --> 00:18:24,747
Lucille? Sitwell? What's this?

330
00:18:24,851 --> 00:18:26,819
It's our romantic getaway, Michael.

331
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,083
Romantic? So, then the company
isn't being taken over...

332
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:32,818
so Lindsay doesn't have
to be with UncleJack?

333
00:18:32,926 --> 00:18:36,362
Oh, Tobias.
We gotta stop Linds-Tobias?

334
00:18:36,463 --> 00:18:39,694
- How'd you like to take a nap, baldy?
- I'll handle this.

335
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:42,791
She's my girlfriend, pal.
Take him down, Buster.

336
00:18:42,902 --> 00:18:46,201
Your girlfriend? That's why
you were in her robe and slippies.

337
00:18:46,306 --> 00:18:48,399
You weren't trying
to get into her head.

338
00:18:48,508 --> 00:18:51,534
You were trying to get into her...
robe and slippies.

339
00:18:51,645 --> 00:18:54,205
She's my girlfriend!

340
00:18:57,417 --> 00:19:00,045
So this is
who you choose over me?

341
00:19:00,153 --> 00:19:03,953
She's not with him.
She's with the Bullet.

342
00:19:04,057 --> 00:19:05,991
Oh, thank God.

343
00:19:06,092 --> 00:19:10,495
But if you want a fight,
you got it. Shoot me!

344
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:17,068
<i>Stop it! Stop it!</i>

345
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:21,607
Look, I wasn't trying
to sell your company, but I am now.

346
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:24,370
The hell with all of you.

347
00:19:24,477 --> 00:19:26,536
I'm gonna try and lowball her.

348
00:19:26,646 --> 00:19:30,377
- Not while we're around.
- We're not done here, Gob!

349
00:19:31,818 --> 00:19:34,582
<i>Tobias? Tobias, I'm sorry.</i>

350
00:19:34,688 --> 00:19:37,316
I set this up for Lindsay.
Lindsay, I'm sorry.

351
00:19:37,424 --> 00:19:40,359
- You were not on a date with Dragon.
- I know that, Michael.

352
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:43,657
It was pretty obvious when Dragon
kept swooping UncleJack in for a kiss.

353
00:19:43,763 --> 00:19:47,062
<i>You said I never did anything
for the company. L-I just thought I'd try.</i>

354
00:19:47,167 --> 00:19:51,661
<i>Tobias, I never thought
you'd ever fight for me.</i>

355
00:19:51,771 --> 00:19:56,174
I had no idea a 90-year-old man
could cave in my chest cavity like that.

356
00:19:56,276 --> 00:19:59,507
Dragon, would you mind
carrying my husband to the car?

357
00:20:03,149 --> 00:20:05,481
Oh, God.

358
00:20:05,585 --> 00:20:09,146
<i>I love takin' a guy down!</i>

359
00:20:09,255 --> 00:20:11,723
I think I snapped one of his ribs.

360
00:20:11,825 --> 00:20:14,350
<i>No. It's my leg.</i>

361
00:20:14,461 --> 00:20:16,861
I'll bet that would hurt.

362
00:20:16,963 --> 00:20:19,932
I guess the deal's off now,
now that I actually need you to help us out?

363
00:20:20,033 --> 00:20:23,230
<i>I'll make you a deal.
You carry me, and I'll carry you.</i>

364
00:20:23,336 --> 00:20:25,702
Thanks, UncleJack.

365
00:20:25,805 --> 00:20:28,933
- Yeah. I think we should get to the hospital.
- Let me see.

366
00:20:29,042 --> 00:20:32,375
I think this duct tape is the only thing
that's keeping the ankle on.

367
00:20:32,479 --> 00:20:37,314
Okay. Ah. Right around there.
Oh. I think you're right inside me now.

368
00:20:37,417 --> 00:20:39,044
<i>On the next
Arrested Development.</i>

369
00:20:39,152 --> 00:20:41,279
<i>UncleJack buys the company...</i>

370
00:20:41,387 --> 00:20:43,321
<i>but makes some changes ofhis own.</i>

371
00:20:43,423 --> 00:20:46,449
And he's gonna make me president.

372
00:20:48,561 --> 00:20:51,189
<i>Tobias listens to
a day's worth ofhis own words...</i>

373
00:20:51,297 --> 00:20:53,925
<i>to see what Michael was referring to.</i>

374
00:20:54,033 --> 00:20:57,196
Even if it means
me taking a chubby, I will suck it up.

375
00:20:57,303 --> 00:21:00,795
Nothing wrong with that.
I've been in the film business for a while...

376
00:21:00,907 --> 00:21:03,102
but I just can't seem
to get one in the can.

377
00:21:03,209 --> 00:21:05,234
It's out of context.

378
00:21:05,345 --> 00:21:08,940
<i>I wouldn't mind kissing
that man between the cheeks, so to speak.</i>

379
00:21:09,048 --> 00:21:12,506
<i>And he realizes there is
something distinct about the way he speaks.</i>

380
00:21:12,619 --> 00:21:15,850
Tobias, you blowhard!

381
00:21:16,619 --> 00:21:59,850
