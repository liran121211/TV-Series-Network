00:00:01,015 --> 00:00:04,007
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:04,118 --> 00:00:06,177
<i>and the one son who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:06,286 --> 00:00:08,618
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:14,128 --> 00:00:15,789
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

5
00:00:19,633 --> 00:00:21,601
<i>This is Michael Bluth.</i>

6
00:00:21,702 --> 00:00:25,900
<i>Right now he's taking his son, George Michael,
to start a new life in Arizona.</i>

7
00:00:26,006 --> 00:00:28,770
Phoenix, Arizona, huh?
This is it, boy.

8
00:00:28,876 --> 00:00:30,867
We are free.

9
00:00:30,978 --> 00:00:32,969
We're gonna follow our dreams,
you know?

10
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,981
And the best part of it?
Not workin' for the family anymore.

11
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:39,382
Yeah, but don't-
don't you always say "family first"?

12
00:00:39,486 --> 00:00:44,150
Yes, I do.
But that is not a family, okay?

13
00:00:44,258 --> 00:00:48,194
They're a bunch of greedy, selfish people
who have our nose.

14
00:00:48,295 --> 00:00:51,696
- And Aunt Lindsay.
- She's not my real aunt?

15
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:55,064
Not a real nose. Got a picture of her
when she's 14 in a swimming cap.

16
00:00:55,169 --> 00:00:57,137
She looks like a falcon.

17
00:00:57,237 --> 00:01:01,333
Spent an entire year living in that
stupid model home with those people...

18
00:01:01,442 --> 00:01:03,603
and all they did was lie to us.

19
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:07,578
<i>The most recent lie was Michael's
father had had a heart attack while in prison.</i>

20
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:10,411
We lost him.

21
00:01:10,517 --> 00:01:14,248
<i>What the doctor meant to say
was that George Sr. Had escaped...</i>

22
00:01:14,354 --> 00:01:17,949
<i>a feat he'd accomplished by using
the family's portable stairway vehicle.</i>

23
00:01:20,194 --> 00:01:23,095
I'd love to see the look on their faces
right now.

24
00:01:23,197 --> 00:01:26,428
- "Where'd he go?"
- Or they- they think we're just headed home.

25
00:01:26,533 --> 00:01:29,001
Actually, you know,
that's kind of what I thought...

26
00:01:29,103 --> 00:01:31,298
until I heard about
all that Phoenix stuff.

27
00:01:31,405 --> 00:01:35,102
<i>Michael was concerned
that the full impact ofhis departure...</i>

28
00:01:35,209 --> 00:01:37,769
<i>might have been lost on his family.</i>

29
00:01:37,878 --> 00:01:40,540
- Hello. Who is this?
- Yes, this is Dr. Blumen.

30
00:01:40,647 --> 00:01:43,081
I'm calling regarding Michael Bluth.

31
00:01:43,183 --> 00:01:47,119
Michael! Phone!

32
00:01:47,221 --> 00:01:51,487
They think we're still there.
We're goin' back.

33
00:01:51,592 --> 00:01:54,561
Hey, Mom. Any messages?

34
00:01:54,661 --> 00:01:57,186
None.

35
00:01:57,297 --> 00:01:59,231
No, there was a message.

36
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:01,301
It was about my health,
but it doesn't matter.

37
00:02:01,401 --> 00:02:03,301
My son and l-

38
00:02:03,403 --> 00:02:05,963
<i>Buster, what are you doing
with Mother's rape horn?</i>

39
00:02:06,073 --> 00:02:11,136
<i>Yes, I have a rape horn, Michael,
because you took away my mace.</i>

40
00:02:11,245 --> 00:02:14,646
Yeah, like anyone would want to "R" her.

41
00:02:14,748 --> 00:02:16,648
This is what I'm talking about, Michael.

42
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:20,743
<i>Now that your father has deserted us,
Buster's become impossible to control.</i>

43
00:02:20,854 --> 00:02:24,085
<i>Suddenly he's too much of a big shot
to brush Mother's hair.</i>

44
00:02:24,191 --> 00:02:25,818
Well, I'm not he-

45
00:02:28,662 --> 00:02:32,098
I'm not helping you
with Buster anymore.

46
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:34,895
I'm not helping anyone with anything.

47
00:02:35,002 --> 00:02:37,869
I came here to tell you
that my son and l-

48
00:02:43,443 --> 00:02:46,571
<i>George Michael, meanwhile,
was approached by his cousin Maeby.</i>

49
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,773
So, you're really leavin', huh?

50
00:02:48,882 --> 00:02:51,578
Have you told your girlfriend, Bland?
I mean, Ann.

51
00:02:51,685 --> 00:02:55,086
- She's not my girlfriend, and she's not bland.
- Really?

52
00:02:55,189 --> 00:02:57,783
Because, I mean, under her school picture
it said "not pictured."

53
00:02:57,891 --> 00:03:00,416
Okay, they printed a retraction
in the spring supplement.

54
00:03:00,527 --> 00:03:03,758
And, yeah, she was really lookin' forward
to seeing me in my Uncle Sam outfit...

55
00:03:03,864 --> 00:03:06,059
<i>in that Get Out The Vote
assembly tomorrow.</i>

56
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:08,191
Wasn't that supposed to be
before the election?

57
00:03:08,302 --> 00:03:11,362
They had to postpone it when that foreign
exchange student parked too close to the gym.

58
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:13,564
I do it. I play Uncle Sam.

59
00:03:13,674 --> 00:03:16,973
Better than part I have now-
guy who orders strike on Pearl Harbor.

60
00:03:17,077 --> 00:03:20,569
<i>I don't know why you're not taking
this "I'm out ofhere"seriously...</i>

61
00:03:20,681 --> 00:03:23,912
but I am out of here, seriously.

62
00:03:24,017 --> 00:03:27,544
- Let's face it, Michael.
You've made this threat before.
- Tell me. When?

63
00:03:29,223 --> 00:03:31,987
That's it. I'm out of here.

64
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:38,791
- Ta-da!
- I'm out of here.

65
00:03:38,899 --> 00:03:42,027
<i>We got the attacking animal down.</i>

66
00:03:42,135 --> 00:03:44,729
I'm out of this family, seriously.

67
00:03:44,838 --> 00:03:47,807
This time we're gonna be so far away,
you'll never be able to find us.

68
00:03:47,908 --> 00:03:50,172
- We're goin' to Phoenix.
- Don't tell 'em where.

69
00:03:50,277 --> 00:03:52,302
- L-I just thought-
- It doesn't matter why.

70
00:03:52,412 --> 00:03:54,880
Michael, maybe the reason
why you always come back...

71
00:03:54,982 --> 00:03:57,576
is because you need us
more than we need you.

72
00:03:57,684 --> 00:03:59,811
Oh, that's rich.

73
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,016
Huh. I need you.
All right, I'll tell you what.

74
00:04:04,124 --> 00:04:06,820
<i>Mom, you're always asking me
to help you look after Buster.</i>

75
00:04:06,927 --> 00:04:09,521
You can find somebody else.
I hope she doesn't kill you.

76
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,928
I'll kill her first.

77
00:04:12,032 --> 00:04:15,695
And good luck trying to find someone else
to run the business, by the way.

78
00:04:15,802 --> 00:04:18,270
Gob, instead of always coming to me
asking me for money...

79
00:04:18,372 --> 00:04:20,363
saying, "I've made a huge mistake"...

80
00:04:20,474 --> 00:04:22,499
you can bail yourself out next time.

81
00:04:22,609 --> 00:04:26,773
I've never admitted to a mistake.
What would I have made a mistake about?

82
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,372
<i>Lindsay, instead of sleeping in twin beds,
you and your husband take the master bedroom.</i>

83
00:04:30,484 --> 00:04:33,453
It's not like you've never come to me
with your marital problems...

84
00:04:33,553 --> 00:04:36,545
saying, "Oh, help me, Michael.
I think my husband might be a"-

85
00:04:36,657 --> 00:04:38,557
Ohh!

86
00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:42,993
- Well- It's-
- Here we go.

87
00:04:43,096 --> 00:04:47,032
<i>And so, once again, the guys were
on their way to Phoenix, never to look back.</i>

88
00:04:47,134 --> 00:04:49,034
It's just the lab calling.

89
00:04:49,136 --> 00:04:51,229
We'll give him the bad news in Phoenix.

90
00:04:51,338 --> 00:04:53,806
- They know we're gone.
- Great.

91
00:04:53,907 --> 00:04:57,502
You did say Phoenix again,
but what do we care?

92
00:04:57,611 --> 00:04:59,511
Sorry.

93
00:04:59,613 --> 00:05:04,573
Now, do you want to steer, or are you
too old to sit on your pop's lap and drive?

94
00:05:08,155 --> 00:05:10,146
I think I might be.

95
00:05:10,257 --> 00:05:12,157
Okay.

96
00:05:23,603 --> 00:05:26,071
Car's registered to George Bluth,
so we had to check.

97
00:05:26,173 --> 00:05:29,336
- But he's been caught, so you're free to go.
- He's been caught?

98
00:05:29,443 --> 00:05:31,911
<i>Michael knew
ifhe went back to see his father...</i>

99
00:05:32,012 --> 00:05:34,879
<i>he would only end up
saying something hurtful.</i>

100
00:05:34,981 --> 00:05:37,279
We're goin' back.

101
00:05:37,384 --> 00:05:40,046
<i>In fact, the police only
thought they'd arrested George Sr.</i>

102
00:05:40,153 --> 00:05:43,850
Do you have any cookies
with no preservatives?

103
00:05:43,957 --> 00:05:46,619
<i>But had gotten
his twin brother, Oscar, instead.</i>

104
00:05:46,727 --> 00:05:49,355
- Oscar! A tall tea for Oscar!
- Yeah!

105
00:05:49,463 --> 00:05:51,863
Oh, good grief. It's Oscar.

106
00:05:51,965 --> 00:05:54,866
Oh, thank God you've come.

107
00:05:54,968 --> 00:05:58,404
<i>Lucille had a relationship
with Oscar years earlier...</i>

108
00:05:58,505 --> 00:06:00,973
<i>- which she was not eager to rekindle.
- What is wrong with you?</i>

109
00:06:01,074 --> 00:06:03,042
- The boy is here.
- Oh.

110
00:06:03,143 --> 00:06:07,204
<i>- They said my father was here.
- Did they?</i>

111
00:06:09,483 --> 00:06:12,452
- Let's get out of here.
- What-What about Oscar?

112
00:06:12,552 --> 00:06:14,918
Yes. They impounded my, uh-
my humble trailer.

113
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:16,921
- You'll stay with us.
- No, he won't.

114
00:06:17,023 --> 00:06:19,218
You're the one who says
I need a father figure.

115
00:06:19,326 --> 00:06:22,659
Yes. A father figure.

116
00:06:24,698 --> 00:06:27,394
Fine. But you're not sleeping
in my bed.

117
00:06:27,501 --> 00:06:29,969
- Okay.
- Okay. Yeah.

118
00:06:31,671 --> 00:06:34,162
<i>Soon, Michael arrived to claim his father...</i>

119
00:06:34,274 --> 00:06:37,175
<i>and was met by the family attorney,
Barry Zuckerkorn.</i>

120
00:06:37,277 --> 00:06:39,245
- Hmm.
- No, I know, I know, I know.

121
00:06:39,346 --> 00:06:41,906
Everybody says leave it alone,
leave it alone.

122
00:06:42,015 --> 00:06:44,745
Does this look contagious to you?
Hey, kiddo.

123
00:06:44,851 --> 00:06:47,251
All right. It wasn't your father.

124
00:06:47,354 --> 00:06:50,255
It was your uncle.
I ran into them as they were leaving.

125
00:06:50,357 --> 00:06:52,450
There he is! Got ya!

126
00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:55,687
- Oh, for God's sake.
- Yeah!

127
00:06:55,796 --> 00:06:59,095
I only came back to tell him I was leaving,
so I guess it's time to go, Son.

128
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,997
- Where you going?
- We can't tell you.

129
00:07:02,102 --> 00:07:04,764
No, no. We can tell Barry.
We're going to Phoenix.

130
00:07:04,871 --> 00:07:07,066
Oh, I wish you hadn't have said that.

131
00:07:07,174 --> 00:07:10,143
As your lawyer, I have to inform you
you cannot leave the state.

132
00:07:10,243 --> 00:07:12,438
With your father gone,
they want to hold you.

133
00:07:12,546 --> 00:07:14,776
- M-Me?
- They're going to indict you tomorrow.

134
00:07:14,881 --> 00:07:18,476
All you have to do is come up with the bail.
Take it out of the business.

135
00:07:18,585 --> 00:07:21,611
But l- I can't. I quit. I don't want
to follow in my father's footsteps.

136
00:07:21,721 --> 00:07:24,815
Then you might wind up on his cot.

137
00:07:24,925 --> 00:07:30,056
Oh, man, I wish you hadn't
said Phoenix. Wow.

138
00:07:31,963 --> 00:07:32,297
<i>Michael had just found out
he couldn't leave the state...</i>

139
00:07:32,297 --> 00:07:34,527
<i>Michael had just found out
he couldn't leave the state...</i>

140
00:07:34,632 --> 00:07:36,532
<i>unless he came up with bail.</i>

141
00:07:36,634 --> 00:07:39,899
Okay, listen. I'm gonna get the company
checkbook and don't tell the family.

142
00:07:40,004 --> 00:07:43,132
We can't give them the satisfaction of
telling them that I need money, okay?

143
00:07:43,241 --> 00:07:46,540
- Do you remember what we say about the family?
- It's not Aunt Lindsay's nose.

144
00:07:46,644 --> 00:07:48,202
Yes, but no.

145
00:07:48,313 --> 00:07:50,713
Don't- Don't tell them
that we were goin' to-

146
00:07:50,815 --> 00:07:53,807
- We say we don't need them. Hmm?
- Oh. Yeah. Okay.

147
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:56,352
The new one. I didn't-

148
00:07:56,454 --> 00:07:59,116
<i>It comes
from knowing you're toned and fit.</i>

149
00:07:59,224 --> 00:08:01,488
- What are you doing?
- I'm exercising, Michael.

150
00:08:01,593 --> 00:08:04,858
I see you found an exercise tape
made for people as lazy as you are.

151
00:08:04,963 --> 00:08:08,228
- I do have a love life.
- Tighten, one, two, three.

152
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,233
Okay, this is going off.

153
00:08:10,335 --> 00:08:14,396
<i>One night in the master bedroom,
and you got yourself a love life again?</i>

154
00:08:14,506 --> 00:08:16,701
Well, I'll be honest.
At first, it was awkward.

155
00:08:16,808 --> 00:08:20,574
Together, two, three, four.

156
00:08:20,678 --> 00:08:23,306
<i>- Release, two, three, four.
- Oh, Lindsay.</i>

157
00:08:23,414 --> 00:08:28,113
Uh, well, this is exciting.

158
00:08:28,219 --> 00:08:31,017
- Finally we can be a normal couple.
- Nice to be back in a queen.

159
00:08:33,324 --> 00:08:35,292
- It's too much pressure.
- I can't do this.

160
00:08:35,393 --> 00:08:39,352
<i>So Lindsay and Tobias finally
took a hard look at their relationship.</i>

161
00:08:39,464 --> 00:08:43,958
You know, Lindsay, as a therapist,
I have advised a number of couples...

162
00:08:44,068 --> 00:08:47,060
<i>to explore an open relationship...</i>

163
00:08:47,171 --> 00:08:50,163
where-where the couple
remains emotionally committed...

164
00:08:50,275 --> 00:08:54,075
but free to explore
extramarital encounters.

165
00:08:54,178 --> 00:08:57,204
- Did it work for those people?
- No. It never does.

166
00:08:57,315 --> 00:09:01,775
These people somehow delude themselves
into thinking it might, but-

167
00:09:03,421 --> 00:09:06,356
but it might work for us.

168
00:09:06,457 --> 00:09:10,052
- We could give it a shot.
- Great. We'll hammer out the details later.

169
00:09:10,161 --> 00:09:12,925
Right now we've got a daughter to tell.

170
00:09:13,031 --> 00:09:15,795
Maeby, we're having a family meeting!

171
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,233
<i>- On her way to the family meeting...
- Family meeting!</i>

172
00:09:19,337 --> 00:09:21,271
<i>- Lindsay had an unexpected encounter.
- Hello.</i>

173
00:09:21,372 --> 00:09:23,101
Oh, hi. Gob told me to come by.

174
00:09:23,207 --> 00:09:24,902
Well, uh, I don't think he's here.

175
00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:28,001
Well, tell him I like what I see.

176
00:09:29,747 --> 00:09:33,080
And we probably won't even act on it.
We're not gonna get a divorce.

177
00:09:33,184 --> 00:09:35,744
If anything, it'll bring
Mommy and Daddy closer together.

178
00:09:35,853 --> 00:09:37,821
I met someone. I've got a date.

179
00:09:37,922 --> 00:09:39,822
I'm dating someone.

180
00:09:40,925 --> 00:09:46,659
Well.
Let the great experiment begin!

181
00:09:46,764 --> 00:09:50,427
- You're not using my master bedroom for that.
- I believe you left.

182
00:09:50,535 --> 00:09:52,662
Or did you realize
how much you need us after all?

183
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:55,364
- Actually, I came back because I need something.
- Hmm.

184
00:09:55,473 --> 00:09:59,432
Some things. Like the checkbook.
Where's the corporate checkbook?

185
00:09:59,544 --> 00:10:01,774
Gob must've taken it to the office.

186
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:05,940
<i>Mom put him in charge.
That's right, Michael. He's got your oldjob.</i>

187
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:09,508
Well, I better get over there before
he brings the whole company down.

188
00:10:09,621 --> 00:10:12,647
It's only been three hours.
How much damage could he really do?

189
00:10:12,757 --> 00:10:14,657
And release.

190
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:19,628
<i>In three hours,
Gob had done $45,000 in damage.</i>

191
00:10:19,731 --> 00:10:21,699
In there, please.

192
00:10:23,468 --> 00:10:26,130
Hey, where's my desk?

193
00:10:26,237 --> 00:10:29,297
Oh, I think it's the massage table
in the break room now.

194
00:10:30,341 --> 00:10:32,172
- Take the window.
- No, hold it.

195
00:10:32,276 --> 00:10:34,540
Gob, Mom may think
that she's given you my job...

196
00:10:34,646 --> 00:10:36,841
but the board still has to
approve that decision.

197
00:10:36,948 --> 00:10:40,213
- Actually, they already have.
- Why should we believe in you?

198
00:10:40,318 --> 00:10:43,253
For the same reason you should
believe that a hundred-dollar bill...

199
00:10:43,354 --> 00:10:46,517
is no more than a hundred pennies.

200
00:10:49,761 --> 00:10:51,319
<i>They approved me unanimously.</i>

201
00:10:51,429 --> 00:10:54,592
Why wouldn't they?
You've only lost them $99 so far.

202
00:10:54,699 --> 00:10:56,758
I've already been pretty successful.

203
00:10:56,868 --> 00:10:59,996
Showing the model house again.
Sent a Realtor over there yesterday.

204
00:11:00,104 --> 00:11:03,699
<i>It was this Realtor who'd run into
Lindsay, thinking she was looking for a home.</i>

205
00:11:03,808 --> 00:11:07,676
I have an open thing goin' on too.
I'll give you the address, and you can come by.

206
00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:10,748
<i>And I think you'll really
like the neighbors.</i>

207
00:11:10,848 --> 00:11:12,679
Okay.

208
00:11:12,784 --> 00:11:15,878
So what brings you here?
I hope it's not for a handout.

209
00:11:15,987 --> 00:11:18,353
I run a pretty tight ship around here.

210
00:11:18,456 --> 00:11:21,118
- With a pool table?
- It's a gaming ship.

211
00:11:21,225 --> 00:11:25,093
<i>I'm here because
I thought you might need me.</i>

212
00:11:26,264 --> 00:11:28,391
- I need you?
- That's right.

213
00:11:28,499 --> 00:11:30,933
Oh, boy, that's good.

214
00:11:31,035 --> 00:11:34,903
Can't wait to call the guys in
to hear this one.

215
00:11:35,006 --> 00:11:37,531
Listen-
How do you intercom on this?

216
00:11:37,642 --> 00:11:39,633
- Star two.
- Yeah. At the same time?

217
00:11:39,744 --> 00:11:41,712
Yeah, just-
No, the star in the corner. The star.

218
00:11:41,813 --> 00:11:44,281
- So if I do it like that-
- No, turn it around the other way. Star.

219
00:11:44,382 --> 00:11:46,850
- Oh, that star.
- Let's just hang it up. There we go.

220
00:11:46,951 --> 00:11:50,148
L-I thought that you might need me
to help you with the books.

221
00:11:50,254 --> 00:11:53,121
You know, the corporate checkbook.
Where is it?

222
00:11:53,224 --> 00:11:56,853
Actually, Mom's got it.
She wasn't comfortable with me-

223
00:11:56,961 --> 00:11:59,429
<i>Michael now had the distasteful choice...</i>

224
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:02,158
<i>of either asking his mother for money
or going tojail.</i>

225
00:12:02,266 --> 00:12:05,064
Maybe Buster killed her already.

226
00:12:05,169 --> 00:12:07,637
<i>Tobias was also having a bad day.</i>

227
00:12:07,739 --> 00:12:11,140
<i>Lindsay had met someone,
and he hadn't.</i>

228
00:12:11,242 --> 00:12:15,508
<i>And that's when he found what he thought
was a support group for depressed men.</i>

229
00:12:19,383 --> 00:12:21,977
Well, if it isn't the boy
who cried "Phoenix."

230
00:12:22,086 --> 00:12:26,079
Ohh! No, I was just, uh-
just worried about Buster.

231
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:30,092
<i>I thought maybe I should
give him a little guidance.</i>

232
00:12:30,194 --> 00:12:33,254
Write him a check. Be a role model.
Where's the company checkbook?

233
00:12:33,364 --> 00:12:35,832
I already have a new role model,
Michael.

234
00:12:35,933 --> 00:12:39,801
- His Uncle Oscar is living here now.
- Wow.

235
00:12:39,904 --> 00:12:42,702
You guys have accomplished a lot
in the last three hours.

236
00:12:42,807 --> 00:12:45,708
- Where is he?
- I sent him out for a new air horn.

237
00:12:50,548 --> 00:12:53,449
Yeah!

238
00:12:53,551 --> 00:12:56,884
- We've got it all under control.
- Great.

239
00:12:58,923 --> 00:13:02,484
I'm just worried that it's
only gonna be a matter of time...

240
00:13:02,593 --> 00:13:06,120
before the media starts putting together
all the pieces of this Iraq story.

241
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:08,892
<i>Michael had recently
found out that the model home...</i>

242
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,560
<i>he and his son currently lived in...</i>

243
00:13:11,669 --> 00:13:16,470
<i>was very similar to some his father
may have illegally been building in Iraq.</i>

244
00:13:16,574 --> 00:13:21,204
They haven't yet. And frankly,
it's a very difficult charge to prove.

245
00:13:26,918 --> 00:13:29,978
Man, that jury's gonna
fall in love with you.

246
00:13:30,087 --> 00:13:34,581
- What do you need, Michael?
- I don't need anything.

247
00:13:34,692 --> 00:13:37,661
I'm great,
'cause everyone else is great.

248
00:13:37,762 --> 00:13:41,755
I can't tell you how nice it is
to not be needed anymore.

249
00:13:41,866 --> 00:13:44,426
<i>I want you.</i>

250
00:13:46,003 --> 00:13:50,064
Okay, the jury might actually like that.

251
00:13:50,174 --> 00:13:54,270
<i>It was at that moment that Gob
found something thejury might not like.</i>

252
00:13:55,346 --> 00:13:57,541
Hammer. Oops.

253
00:14:07,525 --> 00:14:09,959
<i>And Lindsay arrived
at what she thought was a date.</i>

254
00:14:10,061 --> 00:14:11,961
<i>Hey! You found it.</i>

255
00:14:12,063 --> 00:14:14,554
So, shall we start in the kitchen?

256
00:14:14,665 --> 00:14:17,361
- I thought the bedroom.
- Sure.

257
00:14:17,468 --> 00:14:20,403
I'll meet you up there.
I gotta make this place smell like cookies.

258
00:14:20,504 --> 00:14:24,907
And you should know,
I am anticipating multiples on this.

259
00:14:25,009 --> 00:14:28,706
Well, I wouldn't be doing this
if I didn't think that was a possibility.

260
00:14:33,184 --> 00:14:36,745
<i>Lindsay was nervous
and took a shower to relax.</i>

261
00:14:36,854 --> 00:14:40,290
I can't do this. I'm not ready for this.

262
00:14:42,026 --> 00:14:44,790
<i>Come on, kids. We'll go downstairs
and have some cookies.</i>

263
00:14:44,896 --> 00:14:47,091
<i>The kids were in for some bad news too.</i>

264
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:50,929
<i>Tobias, meanwhile, discovered that
what he thought was a support group...</i>

265
00:14:51,035 --> 00:14:54,163
<i>turned out to be a team
ofbald men painted blue.</i>

266
00:14:55,773 --> 00:14:58,367
<i>Even Lucille was about
to find herself in trouble.</i>

267
00:14:58,476 --> 00:15:00,569
Oh, you've done this before.

268
00:15:00,678 --> 00:15:03,146
You know, you should let
your hair grow long.

269
00:15:03,247 --> 00:15:06,444
Yeah? I've thought about it.
I guess I'd look like you.

270
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:09,576
More than you'll ever know.

271
00:15:12,423 --> 00:15:14,721
Are you living in one
of Saddam's many palaces?

272
00:15:14,825 --> 00:15:17,293
They may have been built
by the same developer.

273
00:15:17,395 --> 00:15:21,525
<i>And a seal attack.
Meet one surprised bather, coming up.</i>

274
00:15:24,869 --> 00:15:28,270
<i>Seven minutes had passed
since Gob had discovered the document.</i>

275
00:15:28,372 --> 00:15:31,136
Gob, your mother on line one.

276
00:15:32,343 --> 00:15:35,107
I'm coming over.
Don't talk to anyone.

277
00:15:35,212 --> 00:15:38,704
<i>It was at that moment that Lucille
was stopped by a documentary filmmaker.</i>

278
00:15:38,816 --> 00:15:43,082
Uh, your company's being accused of
profiting off the building of houses in Iraq.

279
00:15:43,187 --> 00:15:45,621
That's crazy.
We're all loyal Americans.

280
00:15:45,723 --> 00:15:49,250
Oh, yeah. Would you enlist
your son or daughter in the army?

281
00:15:51,996 --> 00:15:54,464
Yes.

282
00:15:57,134 --> 00:16:00,626
<i>Michael was out of options...</i>

283
00:16:00,738 --> 00:16:05,141
<i>and, knowing that his father had a penchant
for hiding valuable things in walls...</i>

284
00:16:05,242 --> 00:16:08,405
<i>considered one last desperate gambit.</i>

285
00:16:08,512 --> 00:16:12,312
This is crazy. What am I doing?
Using a hammer to try to-

286
00:16:17,254 --> 00:16:19,848
- Are you crazy?
- Are you blue?

287
00:16:19,957 --> 00:16:23,358
Only in color, Michael.
Only in color.

288
00:16:23,461 --> 00:16:26,328
It seems I might have stumbled
upon an acting opportunity.

289
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,660
As a member of the Blue Man Group?

290
00:16:28,766 --> 00:16:30,666
Oh, no, you're thinking
of the support group.

291
00:16:30,768 --> 00:16:34,499
I made that same mistake myself.
They're called the Blue Man Group.

292
00:16:34,605 --> 00:16:37,369
But it's funny. If I hadn't
sought out a support group...

293
00:16:37,475 --> 00:16:42,208
I never would've gotten this gig
as an understudy for a performance art group.

294
00:16:44,015 --> 00:16:46,950
You know, the universe works
in mysterious ways, Michael.

295
00:16:47,051 --> 00:16:51,511
You never know where help is going
to come from until you look for it.

296
00:16:51,622 --> 00:16:54,682
Why does everybody think
that I need help?

297
00:16:54,792 --> 00:16:57,761
Michael, look at you.

298
00:16:57,862 --> 00:17:02,231
I mean, you're holding a sledgehammer,
your shirt is cov- Oh, I did that.

299
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:05,734
Um, here, let me, uh-Well-

300
00:17:05,836 --> 00:17:08,896
<i>And Michael realized
that he, too, had been too proud.</i>

301
00:17:09,006 --> 00:17:11,372
- I need money.
- I can't help you.

302
00:17:11,475 --> 00:17:16,003
I know. It did bother me
that they did so well without me.

303
00:17:16,113 --> 00:17:18,411
But l-I do have to ask them for help.

304
00:17:18,516 --> 00:17:20,780
And I have to ask for an audition.

305
00:17:20,885 --> 00:17:23,251
You haven't auditioned yet?

306
00:17:23,354 --> 00:17:25,686
Oh, no, no.
I'm not in the group yet.

307
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:28,884
No, I'm afraid I just "blue" myself.

308
00:17:30,361 --> 00:17:33,125
There's gotta be
a better way to say that.

309
00:17:34,665 --> 00:17:37,099
<i>Tobias rushed to the theater,
hoping to be seen.</i>

310
00:17:37,201 --> 00:17:39,465
<i>Unfortunately, it was dusk,
and he couldn't be seen.</i>

311
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:42,835
What the hell was that?

312
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:47,240
<i>So, for the second time in two days,
the family gathered at the hospital.</i>

313
00:17:47,344 --> 00:17:49,904
Everything's gonna be okay.
I'm sure he's gonna be fine.

314
00:17:50,014 --> 00:17:53,745
I'm so sorry that this happened.
I spoke to him just before he left the house.

315
00:17:53,851 --> 00:17:57,582
- Oh, really? What was the last thing he said?
- I just "blue" myself.

316
00:17:57,688 --> 00:18:01,454
He said some wonderful things...

317
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:04,926
including the fact
that sometimes people...

318
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:07,759
are too proud to ask for help
when they need it.

319
00:18:07,865 --> 00:18:11,995
- Oh, God! Fine. I need you!
- I need you, okay, Michael?
- No, l-I didn't mean for-

320
00:18:12,103 --> 00:18:14,867
He was a Realtor, Michael.
Now my husband's in the hospital.

321
00:18:14,972 --> 00:18:20,000
Mom volunteered me for the army
just because the fat man dared her to.

322
00:18:20,111 --> 00:18:24,275
- We can't let them take Buster.
- I lost my wig, my Uncle Sam wig.

323
00:18:24,381 --> 00:18:27,373
<i>Michael, I am sitting on
some very hot information here.</i>

324
00:18:27,485 --> 00:18:30,545
I know too much.
I've got the thingy.

325
00:18:30,654 --> 00:18:33,680
Half in English, half in scribbly.

326
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:37,022
Michael, please, we need you!

327
00:18:38,596 --> 00:18:41,258
Well, I hate to cancel
my medical follow-up in Phoenix...

328
00:18:41,365 --> 00:18:44,357
but you give me the corporate checkbook,
I'll see what I can do.

329
00:18:44,468 --> 00:18:46,698
Excuse me. Mrs. Fünke.

330
00:18:46,804 --> 00:18:49,864
- Oh, this guy again.
- How is he, Doctor?

331
00:18:49,974 --> 00:18:52,340
It, uh, looks like he's dead.

332
00:18:52,443 --> 00:18:54,741
<i>- Oh, my God!
- Oh, little guy!</i>

333
00:18:54,845 --> 00:18:58,281
- The tears aren't coming!
The tears just aren't coming!
- Okay, okay.

334
00:18:58,382 --> 00:19:00,475
<i>Uh, just to be clear-</i>

335
00:19:00,584 --> 00:19:03,018
Looks like he's dead, or he is dead?

336
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,088
It just looks like he's dead.

337
00:19:05,189 --> 00:19:08,022
He's got, like, blue paint on him
or something, but he's going to be fine.

338
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:10,593
- What is wrong with you?
- What a- doctor!

339
00:19:10,694 --> 00:19:14,858
- I'll let you celebrate privately.
- Hey, we want this comped!

340
00:19:14,965 --> 00:19:17,433
Well, I'm gonna-
I'm just gonna head out.

341
00:19:17,535 --> 00:19:21,494
You don't need some, uh, piece of-
uncle hanging around.

342
00:19:21,605 --> 00:19:24,733
Hey, hey! That's not my dad. That's not the guy
you want. If you want anybody, it's me.

343
00:19:24,842 --> 00:19:26,503
<i>- What?
- Michael?</i>

344
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:29,238
<i>Yeah. I gotta turn myself in
or make bail...</i>

345
00:19:29,346 --> 00:19:31,314
uh, maybe by, like, 8:00.

346
00:19:31,415 --> 00:19:33,679
Hey, hey, hey. That's enough.

347
00:19:33,784 --> 00:19:36,912
Whoa, hey. You might want
to have that looked at.

348
00:19:37,021 --> 00:19:40,184
Thanks, Mikey.

349
00:19:41,859 --> 00:19:44,089
They think I'm involved
in this Iraq thing...

350
00:19:44,195 --> 00:19:46,663
and I can't prove that I'm not
with Dad not around...

351
00:19:46,764 --> 00:19:49,460
so I need your help
or I'm gonna go to jail.

352
00:19:49,567 --> 00:19:54,402
We've got the proof, Michael.
Dad signed a contract with Saddam.

353
00:19:55,739 --> 00:19:57,707
Hussein.

354
00:19:59,343 --> 00:20:01,038
Use it.

355
00:20:01,145 --> 00:20:04,876
<i>If it makes your father look bad,
then so be it. He's long gone now.</i>

356
00:20:04,982 --> 00:20:08,713
- Hey, uh, where's the briefcase?
- Oscar has it.

357
00:20:08,819 --> 00:20:11,253
Hey, I'm awfully sorry I'm late.

358
00:20:11,355 --> 00:20:14,916
I got here as fast as l-
Oh, how is he?

359
00:20:15,025 --> 00:20:16,993
Did you just change your clothes?

360
00:20:17,094 --> 00:20:19,722
Hey, look what I found on windowsill.

361
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:22,230
<i>Just hat. Someone take wig.</i>

362
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:25,769
<i>In fact, it was George Sr. Who took wig...</i>

363
00:20:25,869 --> 00:20:28,633
<i>- Hit it!
- and was fleeing the country with the evidence...</i>

364
00:20:28,739 --> 00:20:30,764
<i>Michael so badly needed.</i>

365
00:20:32,876 --> 00:20:34,844
You made a huge mistake.

366
00:20:37,248 --> 00:20:39,375
<i>On the next Arrested Development.</i>

367
00:20:39,483 --> 00:20:44,182
<i>- Lindsay almost stumbles
upon a dating opportunity.
- You look really hot.</i>

368
00:20:44,288 --> 00:20:49,248
<i>But instead, is admitted to the hospital
with a fever of 104.</i>

369
00:20:50,728 --> 00:20:53,356
<i>Michael finally gets
the corporate checkbook...</i>

370
00:20:54,999 --> 00:20:58,264
<i>only to find that the family
has gotten to it first.</i>

371
00:20:58,369 --> 00:21:00,428
<i>And Barry lands in jail.</i>

372
00:21:00,537 --> 00:21:02,596
You're glad Tobias is pressing charges?

373
00:21:02,706 --> 00:21:06,198
I am having the time of my life.

374
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:08,574
<i>- Hey.
- Hey, Dr. Hate.</i>

375
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:10,647
<i>No touching!</i>
