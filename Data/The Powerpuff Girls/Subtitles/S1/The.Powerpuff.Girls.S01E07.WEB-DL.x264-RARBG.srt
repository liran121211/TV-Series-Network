- Greatest...
- Video game...

13
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,503
Ever!

14
00:00:42,043 --> 00:00:46,045
"Dragon wizard skateboard
fighters"!

15
00:00:46,047 --> 00:00:48,180
I've studied
all the secret codes.

16
00:00:48,182 --> 00:00:50,749
I'm gonna customize my character
with a bunny hat.

17
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:52,251
I'm gonna blow stuff up.

18
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:55,087
You get it.
You get it.

19
00:00:55,089 --> 00:00:56,188
You get it.

20
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:58,390
Okay, rock paper scissors.

21
00:00:58,392 --> 00:00:59,725
Go!

22
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:01,527
1, 2, 3!

23
00:01:01,529 --> 00:01:04,563
Scissors?
Man, I always lose this game.

24
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,698
Hello?

25
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,500
Emergency at city hall?!

26
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:13,038
Man, I was just about to flip
a 1080 off that dragon spike.

27
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:18,410
Okay, mayor, how can we help
so we can get back to our...

28
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:19,511
Game?

29
00:01:19,513 --> 00:01:21,547
Uh, mayor?

30
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:24,083
Looks like someone had
a wicked party.

31
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:28,587
Mayor?

32
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,422
What happened?

33
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:34,359
"Dear mayor..."

34
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:37,096
"By the time
you read this, I'll be gone."

35
00:01:37,098 --> 00:01:41,233
By working as your assistant
every day for the past 12 years,

36
00:01:41,235 --> 00:01:45,304
I have accumulated
over 1,000 vacation days

37
00:01:45,306 --> 00:01:50,275
"that I'm required to use
on a 1,000-day vacation."

38
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:52,077
1,000-day vacation?

39
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,245
Sweet.

40
00:01:53,247 --> 00:01:56,081
"I couldn't bear to tell you
face-to-face."

41
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:56,882
Goodbye, mayor.

42
00:01:56,884 --> 00:01:58,217
"You'll do just fine."

43
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:00,119
"Miss bellum."

44
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:03,055
Whoa, blossom, you do a really
good miss bellum impression.

45
00:02:03,057 --> 00:02:04,790
Thanks!

46
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:06,291
But
apparently, it's worthless now.

47
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,994
Oh!
Miss bellum was my everything.

48
00:02:09,897 --> 00:02:12,064
This may surprise you, friends,

49
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:16,268
but I've grown
quite dependent on miss bellum.

50
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,003
Eh, eh, eh, eh.

51
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:19,005
Ooh!

52
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,409
Whoo!

53
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:31,850
I'm already beginning
to forget her face.

54
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:34,286
What will I do without her?!

55
00:02:34,288 --> 00:02:35,487
Yeah, that's rough.

56
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:36,688
Well, got to go.
Video game's calling.

57
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,123
Don't worry, mayor.

58
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,992
We'll help you with
whatever you need.

59
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:43,462
Well, I do have a few things.

60
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,032
This to-do list
doesn't look so bad.

61
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:49,101
We should be done with it
by the end of the day.

62
00:02:49,103 --> 00:02:51,803
7 da... ooh, 8 days later...

63
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:54,673
Whoa.
This list sure is extensive.

64
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:58,677
You said it, bubbles.
This is ridiculous!

65
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:01,780
We got to get back to fighting
dragon wizards on skateboards.

66
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:03,682
<i>Breaking news... Bianca Bikini,</i>

67
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:07,186
<i>one-half of the notoriously
overdressed, fashion-obsessed</i>

68
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:10,355
<i>fashionista gang, has
broken out of albatross prison.</i>

69
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,057
<i>She has vowed to free her sister</i>

70
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:14,326
<i>and destroy the powerpuff girls.</i>

71
00:03:14,328 --> 00:03:18,130
<i>I will destroy you,
powerpuff girls!</i>

72
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:19,892
<i>Police warn that she is
armed and fabulous.</i>

73
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:23,068
Ooh! I am fabulous!

74
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,705
But not in these dreadful
horizontal stripes.

75
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:30,409
I'd kill for something
a little more couture.

76
00:03:30,411 --> 00:03:31,743
Dry cleaners?

77
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:33,545
It's not boutique chic,
but it will do.

78
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:36,215
How can I help y... ow!

79
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:39,051
We'll never
get through this list.

80
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:42,354
We need to find the mayor
a new assistant, pronto!

81
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:46,425
Evil is back in
sty-y-y-le!

82
00:03:46,427 --> 00:03:48,193
How 'bout this lady?

83
00:03:48,195 --> 00:03:50,329
A powerpuff girl?

84
00:03:50,331 --> 00:03:51,563
She looks good to me.

85
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,098
Wait. What are her
qualifications?

86
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,400
Hey, lady,
you have a job or what?

87
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,236
A job? I don't job.

88
00:03:57,238 --> 00:03:58,238
You're hired.

89
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,739
Mayor, we got you
a new assistant.

90
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:01,907
Everything's great.
Got to go.

91
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,242
We are video games.
Bye-bye!

92
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:09,081
So, you're the mayor?

93
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,350
I know. Can you believe it?

94
00:04:11,352 --> 00:04:14,219
Well, I can't believe
you're wearing that outfit.

95
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:15,254
Disgraceful.

96
00:04:15,256 --> 00:04:17,089
And you're my new assistant!

97
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:19,358
Anyone recommended by
the powerpuff girls

98
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,592
is okay by me.

99
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,427
Those girls are just
so responsible.

100
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,896
Anyhoo, let me give you a tour.

101
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:27,032
We'll start with
the least interesting part.

102
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,104
This is the master control room.

103
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:33,972
These panels control
all the power

104
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:36,441
to the entire
city of townsville.

105
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,210
The entire city?

106
00:04:38,212 --> 00:04:41,880
So you could
shut off the power to, say,

107
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:45,083
the prison of albatross,
where, say,

108
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:49,388
the extremely trendy
barbarus bikini is being held?

109
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:52,624
Well, that's an oddly specific
and suspicious question,

110
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:55,093
but, uh, yeah, I suppose so.

111
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:56,461
Hmm.

112
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:57,729
Oopsies.

113
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:59,331
Ooh! Fluffy ball!

114
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:00,666
There's so many colors.

115
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:02,100
Uh, come back here, you.

116
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:06,305
Get ready to crush
the powerpuff girls, Barbie.

117
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:09,508
Jailbreaks are so in season.

118
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:27,292
Ugh! Barbie, I love you,
but you can't annihilate

119
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:30,028
the powerpuff girls
looking like that.

120
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,865
Ooh!

121
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:35,767
You read my mind.

122
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:39,671
Shoplifting spre-e-e-e-e-e!

123
00:05:47,715 --> 00:05:50,015
I'm really tired.

124
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:52,184
Well, it's taken bubbles
two hours

125
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:53,852
to customize her character.

126
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,854
But it was tough
to find an outfit

127
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,656
to go with the bunny hat.

128
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:01,693
Well, hello,
passe-puff girls.

129
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,862
Looks like
you're all pooped out.

130
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:08,066
Revenge is the new black.

131
00:06:11,138 --> 00:06:13,372
Don't tell the pickles,
but you may be

132
00:06:13,374 --> 00:06:16,508
my new best friend,
magical color ball.

133
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:18,677
Ooh! My heinie!

134
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:20,912
<i>This just in...</i>

135
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:23,215
hey! That's my new assistant.

136
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:24,916
<i>Bianca bikini,
fiendish criminal...</i>

137
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:26,518
Criminal?!

138
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,754
<i>has just broken
her sister out of prison...</i>

139
00:06:28,756 --> 00:06:30,222
Prison?!

140
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:33,225
<i>and has kidnapped
the powerpuff girls.</i>

141
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:35,827
Kidnapped the powerpuff girls?!

142
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:36,895
<i>More news at 11:00.</i>

143
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:39,164
<i>Next up, cute kittens playing.</i>

144
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,565
Kittens!

145
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:44,035
Wait, kidnapped
the powerpuff girls?!

146
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:48,440
Sweet salami,
what am I gonna do?

147
00:06:48,442 --> 00:06:51,543
I know.
I'll call the powerpuff girls.

148
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:53,912
No. I should call the mayor.

149
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,247
No. I'm the mayor.

150
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:57,582
Ooh! I should call miss bellum.

151
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,853
Oh, this is all my fault!

152
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:06,925
If I weren't so irresponsible,
this wouldn't have happened.

153
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:13,799
Founding fathers,
what should I do?

154
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:15,634
True courage comes from within.

155
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:17,035
What?

156
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:18,537
You want to be a man?

157
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:21,440
Then put on a skirt
and get out there!

158
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:25,610
A
true hero must embrace his destiny.

159
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,813
I know what I have to do.

160
00:07:27,815 --> 00:07:29,981
Get my picture taken.

161
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:32,617
No! It is time
to mayor up.

162
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:33,819
Oh, right!

163
00:07:33,821 --> 00:07:36,755
Uh, "mayor up."
Uh, thanks, Sam.

164
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:43,128
Time to get this party started!

165
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:48,633
Ooh, Barbie, killer idea
to bring this fashion video game

166
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:49,668
to the hideout.

167
00:07:51,405 --> 00:07:52,437
You're right.

168
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:55,307
This tasteless bunny hat
has got to go.

169
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:56,641
Delete!

170
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:57,742
No!

171
00:07:57,744 --> 00:08:00,111
I'd kick your fashionista butts

172
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:04,749
if I wasn't so tired.

173
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:07,986
Not in those mid-'90s throwbacks
you're wearing.

174
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:10,021
That vat of molten polyester

175
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:13,492
is gonna put you puffs
out of style permanently.

176
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:16,661
Prepare to dye, powerpuff girls.

177
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:19,998
And by that,
I mean tie-dyed.

178
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:28,607
Get ready for the clearance bin,
fashionistas.

179
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,943
Is it the polyester fumes,

180
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:34,846
or does that action guy
look like the mayor?

181
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:43,021
Dude, that is the mayor.

182
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,065
Kee-yaa!

183
00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:56,434
Aah!

184
00:08:57,804 --> 00:08:59,204
Ooh!

185
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,873
Whoa. Split-kick combo.

186
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,041
Nice.

187
00:09:15,489 --> 00:09:16,888
Help, mayor!

188
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,724
Hold on, girls!

189
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:25,163
You want to know the real reason
ladies wear heels?

190
00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:33,405
Ha!

191
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:34,839
Get over here.

192
00:09:38,345 --> 00:09:39,644
Oh, no!

193
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,250
Tie-dye!

194
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:49,788
I'm... I'm... Tacky!

195
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:54,693
Powerpuff girls,
are you all right?

196
00:09:54,695 --> 00:09:56,461
Mayor, you saved us.

197
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:59,598
Well, girls,
I'm just glad you're safe.

198
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:02,267
Whoa!

199
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,568
Ow!

200
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,542
All right girls,
time to level up.

201
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:19,651
Ooh.

202
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:26,124
Mayor, are you all right?

203
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:30,161
Oh, girls, uh, what's going on?

204
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:31,630
Uh, where are we?

205
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:33,131
Don't say anything, mayor.

206
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,566
We're sorry.

207
00:10:34,568 --> 00:10:37,068
We were being irresponsible
in our responsibilities

208
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,137
of being responsible
protectors of the city.

209
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:42,073
Basically, we really
junked this one.

210
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:44,943
So, thanks for saving us,
Mr. mayor.

211
00:10:44,945 --> 00:10:46,911
<i>I</i> saved<i> you?</i>

212
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:48,313
Seriously, where are we?

213
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:50,582
And so once again,
the day is saved,

214
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:54,853
thanks to the powerpuff girls
and the action mayor.

215
00:10:57,257 --> 00:11:00,659
I knew you'd do just fine.
