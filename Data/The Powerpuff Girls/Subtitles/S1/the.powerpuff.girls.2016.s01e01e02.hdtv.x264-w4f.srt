1
00:00:01,669 --> 00:00:03,202
Ohh, yeah!

2
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,121
Oh! Yeah!

3
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:36,535
Sensitive thugz
is the best band of all time.

4
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,437
All time.

5
00:00:38,472 --> 00:00:40,072
And my main man Dax

6
00:00:40,107 --> 00:00:42,541
is like the baddest boy
the world's ever seen.

7
00:00:42,576 --> 00:00:45,044
He takes guff from no one.

8
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:47,179
Except the people he lets in.

9
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:51,450
And their manager, Kevonne, has
such an eye for organization.

10
00:00:51,485 --> 00:00:53,152
He'll keep
their profiles growing

11
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:54,787
long after they become obsolete.

12
00:00:54,822 --> 00:00:58,357
That was "I want to listen
to your problems, gurl"

13
00:00:58,392 --> 00:00:59,691
by the sensitive thugz.

14
00:01:01,462 --> 00:01:03,595
And now, the moment
you've all been waiting for.

15
00:01:03,631 --> 00:01:05,197
It's your last chance
to win tickets

16
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:06,799
for their sold-out show
tonight.

17
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:08,600
Get those phones out
because the tickets will go

18
00:01:08,636 --> 00:01:10,402
to the listener who
can answer this question...

19
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:13,639
If chance, the lead singer
of the sensitive thugz,

20
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:17,109
could have any animal as a pet,
what would it be?

21
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:19,745
Hello, what's your name?

22
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,214
This is Bubbles
from central Townsville.

23
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:25,250
Chance would have a wallaby
because they're sweet,

24
00:01:25,286 --> 00:01:28,153
but also tough, just like
the sensitive thugz.

25
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:29,822
True dat, girl.

26
00:01:29,857 --> 00:01:32,291
Congratulations, Bubbles!

27
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:35,127
Because you
and one guest of your choice

28
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:37,596
are seeing sensitive thugz
tonight!

29
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:39,765
Ahhh!

30
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,733
I did it, I did it, I did it!

31
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:43,402
You won, you won, you won!

32
00:01:45,306 --> 00:01:48,440
I can't believe I won!

33
00:01:48,476 --> 00:01:51,176
Now you just have to decide
who to take!

34
00:01:51,212 --> 00:01:52,878
Yeah, 'cause you can...

35
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:54,413
Only take...

36
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:55,614
One of us.

37
00:01:57,184 --> 00:02:00,786
Oh, yeah! 'Cause there's
only... Two tickets.

38
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,523
So... Bubbles.

39
00:02:04,558 --> 00:02:06,525
Who are you, uh,
thinking of taking, huh?

40
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,394
Um... I guess... Um...

41
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,562
I'll take...

42
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:13,232
that phone call.

43
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:15,567
Hello, this is Bubbles
from central Townsville.

44
00:02:15,603 --> 00:02:17,769
Mayday! Mayday!

45
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:19,505
Mayor?
What's the matter?

46
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,773
There's something wrong
with my plane.

47
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:23,408
It doesn't seem to have...

48
00:02:23,444 --> 00:02:24,476
A pilot.

49
00:02:24,512 --> 00:02:26,345
Aah!

50
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,180
Don't worry, mayor!
We're on our way.

51
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:29,215
Let's go!

52
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:32,217
The mayor's distress signal

53
00:02:32,253 --> 00:02:35,254
was coming from somewhere
near monster island.

54
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:37,222
That's a dangerous place!

55
00:02:37,258 --> 00:02:38,790
Look!
There it is!

56
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,727
Hey, it's the mayor's plane!

57
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:44,196
But where's the mayor?

58
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:45,731
This place is creepy.

59
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:47,834
What's that?

60
00:02:50,738 --> 00:02:53,172
Oh, my gosh!
He's so cute!

61
00:02:53,207 --> 00:02:55,807
But not as cute as you, girl.

62
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:58,277
Be careful!
He might be dangerous!

63
00:03:00,648 --> 00:03:04,683
His name is Frederick,
and he's not dangerous.

64
00:03:19,567 --> 00:03:20,766
Yeah!

65
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:22,868
Fight, fight, fight, fight!

66
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:25,304
Come on.
We have to find the mayor.

67
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:28,173
Aw, man! That fight was
just getting started!

68
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:30,542
That spiky monster was
gonna do something big!

69
00:03:30,578 --> 00:03:32,611
You see?!

70
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:36,815
Good thing you found
the mayor's tracks, Frederick.

71
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,617
Hey, Bubbles!

72
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:41,453
Did you know that chance's
middle name is also Frederick?

73
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:43,488
Oh.
No, I did not.

74
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:45,958
Well, there's a lot more
sensitive thugz knowledge

75
00:03:45,993 --> 00:03:48,527
where that came from
that I'd be happy to share

76
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:49,728
with you later tonight.

77
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:51,496
She'll just yammer on

78
00:03:51,532 --> 00:03:53,365
about that dorky nonsense
forever.

79
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,667
Hey!
At least I'm a fan.

80
00:03:55,703 --> 00:03:57,536
A fan of your own voice.

81
00:03:57,605 --> 00:04:00,239
Oh, is that right?
Well, let me tell you something.

82
00:04:00,274 --> 00:04:01,406
Girls!

83
00:04:01,442 --> 00:04:02,808
We're never gonna find the mayor

84
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:04,409
if you keep fighting like that.

85
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:05,677
Now, be nice to each other.

86
00:04:05,713 --> 00:04:06,878
Fine.

87
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:08,413
Okay. Now hug.

88
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:12,184
Say "I love you."

89
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:14,853
I love you.
I love you.

90
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:16,521
Now say "I'm a buttzilla."

91
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:18,490
I'm a buttzilla.

92
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:21,760
You're a buttzilla.

93
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,796
Hey! What? Wait!
Blossom!

94
00:04:24,832 --> 00:04:26,932
Say you're a buttzilla.

95
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:31,803
Aah!

96
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,945
That was...
Um... Unexpected.

97
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:46,351
I think he smells something.

98
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,858
Um... Where are we?

99
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,929
It looks like we're inside a...

100
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,064
Volcano!
Volcano!

101
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:00,699
Jinx!

102
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:04,770
You can't talk till someone
says your full name, dude!

103
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:07,306
That's for calling me
a buttzilla.

104
00:05:07,341 --> 00:05:09,908
Aww. Are you two
getting along now?

105
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:13,779
Sure are.
Isn't that right, Bloss?

106
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,647
That is just so very great!

107
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,450
The mayor's hat!

108
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,419
He must have been down here.

109
00:05:27,695 --> 00:05:29,861
She seems... Nice.

110
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:37,002
Bubbles, we really got to work
on your definition of "nice."

111
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,607
Don't you think
using your ice breath

112
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:43,909
is kind of like talking?

113
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:46,845
Bloss-sister?

114
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,780
Oh, snap, girl.

115
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:51,483
You best recognize
the rules of jinx.

116
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,552
Don't worry, Bubbles.
I got this.

117
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,389
Hey! Lava lady!

118
00:06:00,461 --> 00:06:02,494
You're not so hot.

119
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:10,736
Dax would be proud.

120
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:13,638
Yeah, girl.
You know I am.

121
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:15,807
Yay!

122
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,719
That was awesome, Buttercup!

123
00:06:27,755 --> 00:06:29,020
Yeah, well.

124
00:06:32,126 --> 00:06:33,859
What's wrong?
Are you okay?

125
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:38,864
Hoo-hoo!

126
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:42,100
Ohh, it's about the sensitive
thugz tickets, isn't it?

127
00:06:42,136 --> 00:06:44,035
Well, if you're
gonna be like that,

128
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:46,805
then I'm just gonna give
my other ticket to Buttercup.

129
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,807
Yes!

130
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:51,543
Sorry, Blossom.
I just think that...

131
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,680
She said your full name, girl.

132
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:57,616
Now you can unbottle
those feelings

133
00:06:57,651 --> 00:07:00,152
and spill out your heart, girl.

134
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:04,456
Buttercup jinxed me as payback

135
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:06,625
because she called herself
a buttzilla alone!

136
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,126
She doesn't deserve the ticket!

137
00:07:08,162 --> 00:07:10,662
Whatever, dude!

138
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:13,098
You're just jealous!
I totally deserve that ticket.

139
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:15,600
You do not!

140
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:18,136
Oh, and the volcano
is about to erupt.

141
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:24,810
So you guys never
stopped fighting?

142
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:26,611
She never stopped first!

143
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:28,480
That doesn't even make sense!

144
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:30,882
Buttercup, I am not
taking you anymore.

145
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:32,684
What?
Yes!

146
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:35,587
It seems like the only person
I can count on is frede...

147
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,823
Rick.

148
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:44,930
Frederick!

149
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,570
Come on, bubbs!

150
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:53,839
You... Gotta... Decide!

151
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:59,578
Pick... One...

152
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:01,580
Of... Us!

153
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:03,648
Eeeeee-nough!

154
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:08,453
Frederick!

155
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:16,094
All right. There's only one way
to settle this.

156
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:18,029
Rap battle.

157
00:08:18,065 --> 00:08:19,498
Bubbs is the judge.

158
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:20,533
Wait, what?

159
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:24,603
Unh! Yeah!

160
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:27,072
Well, my name is
Blossom, and I'm here to say...

161
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:29,841
No! No rapping!

162
00:08:29,877 --> 00:08:31,743
You two have gotten so greedy

163
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:34,446
that you forgot why we're here!

164
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:36,014
We need to find the may...

165
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:45,524
Frederick! Help!

166
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,160
Wow, super helpful.

167
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:51,563
Glad to have you
part of the team, pal.

168
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:02,073
Aw, man!

169
00:09:02,109 --> 00:09:03,675
Being devoured by monsters

170
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,777
is really low
on my list of ways to die.

171
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:07,479
Bubbles...

172
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:12,083
We... I was being selfish,
and I completely lost focus.

173
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:17,589
And we've been really lame
with the fighting

174
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:19,925
and the jinxing and...
And...

175
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,461
We... we're sorry that
we got you into this mess.

176
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,008
Aaah!

177
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:47,886
Hey, girls!

178
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,855
H-how did you even...
When did you...

179
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:53,692
How did you not get
eaten by those monsters?

180
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:56,227
Oh, these monsters are darling!

181
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:58,663
They go nuts for my pickles!

182
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:01,800
So all you had to do
to keep the monsters tame

183
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:03,068
is feed them pickles?

184
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,837
Yep! Ooh,
and that was the last one.

185
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:11,042
Okay.
Time to go.

186
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,614
Sorry we were being
such buttzillas.

187
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:17,148
It's all right, girls.

188
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:19,851
But I do think I know who
I'm gonna take to the concert.

189
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:21,586
Please be me, please be me.

190
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:23,655
Please be me, please be me.

191
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:26,691
Is it me?
It is me, right?

192
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:29,594
Tell me it's me.
You can tell me it's me.

193
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:42,240
Hey. This song goes out
to our number-one fan, Bubbles.

194
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:43,675
Oh, my gosh!

195
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,845
It's called "I'm a crazy
dangerous monster"

196
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,015
when it comes to holding
your hand, girl."

197
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:52,984
Yay!

198
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:57,789
I'm a crazy monster, girl

199
00:11:06,655 --> 00:11:10,157
Ah, lunchtime
at the school cafeteria.

200
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:11,458
Cute ribbons.

201
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,793
Ooh, glitter!

202
00:11:12,795 --> 00:11:14,828
Scrapbooking is so awesome!

203
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:15,762
Yay!

204
00:11:15,764 --> 00:11:18,365
Dudes!
It's sloppy Joe Tuesday!

205
00:11:18,367 --> 00:11:20,200
They should make this a holiday.

206
00:11:20,202 --> 00:11:22,869
Um, what happened
to your forehead?

207
00:11:22,871 --> 00:11:26,039
Oh, that? Funny story.
Check it.

208
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,875
So there's this guy
at the construction yard, Mac.

209
00:11:28,877 --> 00:11:32,946
So he says his forklift
can crush anything... anything!

210
00:11:32,948 --> 00:11:35,749
And I'm all like,
"I'm stronger than that."

211
00:11:35,751 --> 00:11:40,053
And anyway,
I arm-wrestled a forklift.

212
00:11:40,055 --> 00:11:41,521
Oh.

213
00:11:41,523 --> 00:11:42,622
Interesting.

214
00:11:42,624 --> 00:11:44,958
Uh, hey, Buttercup.

215
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:49,830
Do you want to, uh, sit with us
and, you know, chew?

216
00:11:49,832 --> 00:11:51,932
We're talking about
scrapbooking!

217
00:11:51,934 --> 00:11:53,500
Uh, yeah.

218
00:11:53,502 --> 00:11:54,534
No.

219
00:11:54,536 --> 00:11:55,769
That's not really my thing.

220
00:11:55,771 --> 00:11:57,437
I'll just grab a seat
over there.

221
00:11:58,841 --> 00:12:01,141
Pfft.
Scrapbooking.

222
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:19,025
Hey.
You're Buttercup, right?

223
00:12:19,027 --> 00:12:20,026
Who's asking?

224
00:12:20,028 --> 00:12:22,762
I'm Maylyn,
head of the derbytantes.

225
00:12:24,533 --> 00:12:25,899
Dig your head scrape.

226
00:12:25,901 --> 00:12:28,235
You get that from fighting
a monster or something?

227
00:12:28,237 --> 00:12:30,670
Forklift.

228
00:12:30,672 --> 00:12:32,606
Dig your skates.

229
00:12:32,608 --> 00:12:34,508
Yeah.
We never take them off.

230
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:36,343
We grind on skates.

231
00:12:36,345 --> 00:12:38,478
We skateboard on skates.

232
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,481
We even do pottery on skates.

233
00:12:41,483 --> 00:12:42,949
Best work yet.

234
00:12:42,951 --> 00:12:44,151
Thanks!

235
00:12:45,521 --> 00:12:46,987
Whoo! Whoo!

236
00:12:46,989 --> 00:12:50,123
We also play deathball
on skates.

237
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,758
Whoa. Back up.

238
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,693
What's deathball?

239
00:12:53,695 --> 00:12:55,362
You should find out.

240
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,900
Hey, Buttercup.
Who are your friends?

241
00:12:59,902 --> 00:13:03,203
Do they want to come
scrapbooking, too?

242
00:13:03,205 --> 00:13:05,105
Deathball.

243
00:13:07,075 --> 00:13:09,276
Hey, girls.

244
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:10,710
Princess morbucks?

245
00:13:12,648 --> 00:13:15,849
I see butterbutt has
left you for new friends.

246
00:13:15,851 --> 00:13:17,150
No, she's just off...

247
00:13:17,152 --> 00:13:18,218
Playing deathball...

248
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,786
With some people.

249
00:13:19,788 --> 00:13:22,556
Well, if you need a replacement,

250
00:13:22,558 --> 00:13:25,258
I know a stunningly
gorgeous redhead

251
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:28,395
with loads of sass
and gobs of cash.

252
00:13:28,397 --> 00:13:29,863
Mike drop!

253
00:13:29,865 --> 00:13:31,698
We don't need a replacement.

254
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,167
Come on, Bubbles.
We'll see Buttercup later.

255
00:13:35,437 --> 00:13:37,370
Sure you will.

256
00:13:37,372 --> 00:13:39,239
"Later."

257
00:13:40,642 --> 00:13:42,609
Where's Buttercup?

258
00:13:42,611 --> 00:13:44,177
Deathball!

259
00:13:45,547 --> 00:13:47,147
Where's Buttercup?

260
00:13:48,517 --> 00:13:49,816
Ow!

261
00:13:49,818 --> 00:13:51,685
Where's Buttercup?

262
00:13:55,557 --> 00:13:58,358
I miss Buttercup.

263
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,694
Deathball!

264
00:14:07,135 --> 00:14:09,669
Buttercup, Buttercup, Buttercup!

265
00:14:09,671 --> 00:14:12,472
Buttercup, Buttercup, Buttercup!

266
00:14:14,009 --> 00:14:16,576
Hey, guys. You see that
butt-whupping I just gave?

267
00:14:16,578 --> 00:14:18,612
Oh, yeah.
You did great.

268
00:14:18,614 --> 00:14:21,214
Thanks.
So... What's up?

269
00:14:21,216 --> 00:14:23,650
Well, we noticed that
you've been hanging out

270
00:14:23,652 --> 00:14:25,085
with your new friends a lot,

271
00:14:25,087 --> 00:14:27,020
and we thought
that we would come by

272
00:14:27,022 --> 00:14:28,888
and bring you some lunch
and stuff.

273
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:30,690
We brought leftover lasagna.

274
00:14:30,692 --> 00:14:33,393
Everything chill
over here, Buttlyn?

275
00:14:33,395 --> 00:14:34,761
Uh, Buttlyn?

276
00:14:35,897 --> 00:14:37,430
That's my new nickname.

277
00:14:37,432 --> 00:14:39,966
Everyone in the gang has names
that rhyme with "lyn."

278
00:14:39,968 --> 00:14:41,735
This is Maylyn.
'Sup?

279
00:14:41,737 --> 00:14:43,036
Jaylyn.
Yo.

280
00:14:43,038 --> 00:14:45,705
And bobbysuzerae... Lyn.

281
00:14:45,707 --> 00:14:46,840
Hi, guys.

282
00:14:46,842 --> 00:14:48,742
Come on, Buttlyn, let's bolt.

283
00:14:50,646 --> 00:14:52,379
See you cats on the flip side.

284
00:14:52,381 --> 00:14:53,513
Buttercup, wait!

285
00:14:54,449 --> 00:14:58,451
I should have called it
death-lasagna.

286
00:14:59,321 --> 00:15:01,688
We've lost our sister,
haven't we?

287
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:03,089
Don't be silly, Bubbles!

288
00:15:03,091 --> 00:15:06,259
Buttercup is just being,
well, Buttercup.

289
00:15:06,261 --> 00:15:07,394
I guess.

290
00:15:07,396 --> 00:15:09,796
Hey, super gal pals!

291
00:15:09,798 --> 00:15:11,798
Looks like there's an opening

292
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,734
now that your sister
ditched you.

293
00:15:16,271 --> 00:15:17,971
Ahh!

294
00:15:17,973 --> 00:15:19,606
She didn't ditch us.

295
00:15:19,608 --> 00:15:20,840
Yes, she did.

296
00:15:20,842 --> 00:15:23,743
And I want to be
a powerpuff girl.

297
00:15:23,745 --> 00:15:25,879
There is an opening, after all.

298
00:15:25,881 --> 00:15:27,781
She does have a point.

299
00:15:27,783 --> 00:15:29,215
No, she doesn't.

300
00:15:29,217 --> 00:15:31,284
Bubbles, she can't even fly.

301
00:15:31,286 --> 00:15:32,552
Powerboots!

302
00:15:32,554 --> 00:15:33,653
Big deal.

303
00:15:33,655 --> 00:15:34,921
You don't have any superpowers.

304
00:15:34,923 --> 00:15:37,724
Powergloves!

305
00:15:37,726 --> 00:15:40,560
Well, you don't even
have a costume.

306
00:15:40,562 --> 00:15:42,529
Power-threads!

307
00:15:43,632 --> 00:15:45,632
So am I in or what?

308
00:15:45,634 --> 00:15:47,067
Just... no.

309
00:15:47,069 --> 00:15:49,936
Look, Buttercup is our sister.

310
00:15:49,938 --> 00:15:51,404
And we're a team.

311
00:15:51,406 --> 00:15:54,741
She'll always be there for us,
no matter what.

312
00:15:54,743 --> 00:15:56,209
Hmph!

313
00:15:56,211 --> 00:16:00,447
Oh, really?
Well, then, let's find out.

314
00:16:02,384 --> 00:16:05,318
<i>Initiate monster attack.</i>

315
00:16:09,191 --> 00:16:12,459
<i>Monster needed 2.3 miles.</i>

316
00:16:16,598 --> 00:16:17,864
Showtime.

317
00:16:21,169 --> 00:16:25,405
Fear me
for I am an evil monster!

318
00:16:27,976 --> 00:16:31,578
Feel my wrath,
oh, citizens of Townsville!

319
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,713
Trouble!
Let's go, Bubbles!

320
00:16:33,715 --> 00:16:35,315
But what about Buttercup?

321
00:16:35,317 --> 00:16:36,383
She'll be there!

322
00:16:37,619 --> 00:16:40,387
We'll just see about that.

323
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:47,394
Man, this is the most fun
I think I've ever had.

324
00:16:47,396 --> 00:16:48,862
I know, right?

325
00:16:48,864 --> 00:16:51,631
No thanks to you losers.

326
00:16:51,633 --> 00:16:54,000
Awesome!

327
00:16:56,705 --> 00:16:58,972
Oh! Scoundrels.

328
00:16:58,974 --> 00:17:01,908
Whoa, no!
My sisters need me!

329
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,143
Whoa.

330
00:17:03,145 --> 00:17:04,744
What's your hurry, Buttlyn?

331
00:17:04,746 --> 00:17:08,348
We're about to order some pizzas
and huck 'em on the rooves!

332
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:11,017
I'll hang later.
Duty calls.

333
00:17:11,019 --> 00:17:13,353
But the pizzas will get cold.

334
00:17:13,355 --> 00:17:15,622
We'll order more.
I got to go.

335
00:17:16,425 --> 00:17:19,159
Sorry, Buttlyn.
Can't let you do that.

336
00:17:19,161 --> 00:17:20,827
Maylyn, what do you mean?

337
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:22,662
Princess moneyface or whatever

338
00:17:22,664 --> 00:17:25,732
is paying us to keep you away
from your sisters.

339
00:17:25,734 --> 00:17:27,434
Moneyface?

340
00:17:27,436 --> 00:17:29,369
Moneyface.

341
00:17:29,371 --> 00:17:30,270
Morbucks?!

342
00:17:30,272 --> 00:17:32,338
Yeah. Yeah.
Moneybutt.

343
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,574
She paid us
to hang out with you.

344
00:17:36,211 --> 00:17:39,245
So you're not really my friends.

345
00:17:39,247 --> 00:17:41,414
No, we are.
You're cool and all,

346
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:44,150
but we need monies
for skates and junk.

347
00:17:44,152 --> 00:17:46,019
You understand, right?

348
00:17:46,021 --> 00:17:50,490
The only thing I understand
is that my sisters need me.

349
00:17:50,492 --> 00:17:52,792
Now get out of my way.

350
00:17:55,397 --> 00:17:57,096
Where's Buttercup?

351
00:17:57,098 --> 00:17:59,199
She'll be here any sec.

352
00:17:59,201 --> 00:18:01,634
Huh?

353
00:18:01,636 --> 00:18:04,037
Yah! Hah! Ugh! Yah!

354
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:06,005
Huh! Ha! Nyah!

355
00:18:06,007 --> 00:18:08,141
Need someone to lend a hand?

356
00:18:08,143 --> 00:18:11,211
My offer's still on
the very expensive table!

357
00:18:11,213 --> 00:18:12,011
Fine.

358
00:18:12,013 --> 00:18:13,313
Whatever...

359
00:18:13,315 --> 00:18:14,414
You... Want!

360
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,716
I want to be a powerpuff girl!

361
00:18:16,718 --> 00:18:18,151
Okay!

362
00:18:18,153 --> 00:18:20,253
You're a power...

363
00:18:20,255 --> 00:18:21,754
Puff... Girl!

364
00:18:21,756 --> 00:18:23,056
Yes!

365
00:18:23,058 --> 00:18:26,726
And soon I'll be
the only powerpuff girl.

366
00:18:28,763 --> 00:18:32,432
Excuse me.
I think we're done here.

367
00:18:35,136 --> 00:18:37,103
<i>Monstering complete.</i>

368
00:18:37,105 --> 00:18:39,472
That was a four-star performance
if I ever saw one.

369
00:18:39,474 --> 00:18:41,274
You better give me
a good rating.

370
00:18:41,276 --> 00:18:46,246
Oh, the folly of my ways!

371
00:18:47,182 --> 00:18:48,848
This is for Blossom!

372
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:50,183
This is for Bubbles!

373
00:18:50,185 --> 00:18:53,453
This is for me!
This is also for me!

374
00:18:56,091 --> 00:18:58,725
<i>Skates.</i>

375
00:18:58,727 --> 00:19:00,059
<i>Buttercup.</i>

376
00:19:01,596 --> 00:19:03,863
That kid's all right.

377
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,568
Buttercup didn't come.

378
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:10,103
Maybe she...

379
00:19:11,573 --> 00:19:14,440
Thanks for making me
part of the team, girls.

380
00:19:14,442 --> 00:19:18,945
I got you a little something
as a token of my appreciation.

381
00:19:20,048 --> 00:19:21,881
Ooh. Pretty.

382
00:19:23,251 --> 00:19:24,417
Hey!

383
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:28,555
It's an necronium diamond...
Indestructible.

384
00:19:30,025 --> 00:19:33,259
Ah, because
a true superstar... me...

385
00:19:33,261 --> 00:19:35,662
Knows when it's time to go solo.

386
00:19:35,664 --> 00:19:39,132
After all, I'm pretty much
the most beautiful,

387
00:19:39,134 --> 00:19:41,901
most talented,
most powerful, most...

388
00:19:41,903 --> 00:19:44,103
Most annoying.

389
00:19:44,105 --> 00:19:46,406
Buttercup!

390
00:19:47,842 --> 00:19:50,910
Buttercup!

391
00:19:50,912 --> 00:19:52,579
Stand back!

392
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,115
Hey, girls.

393
00:19:56,117 --> 00:19:59,619
Look what I got
for my half un-birthday.

394
00:20:01,022 --> 00:20:03,723
This is going to be too easy.

395
00:20:03,725 --> 00:20:05,825
Aw, man.

396
00:20:07,362 --> 00:20:09,495
Wait. Check this out.
It came with the suit.

397
00:20:09,497 --> 00:20:12,365
You'll
never save your sisters now.

398
00:20:12,367 --> 00:20:15,134
You like that?
'Cause it's true.

399
00:20:15,136 --> 00:20:18,871
Yeah, not really true,
like, at all.

400
00:20:18,873 --> 00:20:22,508
You see, the derbytantes,
we protect our sisters,

401
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:25,078
and that includes
sisters of sisters.

402
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,081
I thought you were
working for moneypants.

403
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,616
Why should I trust you?

404
00:20:29,618 --> 00:20:32,251
Yeah, you're supposed to be
working for me.

405
00:20:32,253 --> 00:20:35,722
Buttercup earned our respect.
You just paid for it.

406
00:20:35,724 --> 00:20:38,658
Come on. If there's
one thing we're good at,

407
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,360
it's thrashing stuff.

408
00:20:40,362 --> 00:20:42,161
Rock and roll, ladies!

409
00:20:46,067 --> 00:20:48,101
Blades up, girls!

410
00:20:55,877 --> 00:20:58,044
Anyone for a game of deathball?

411
00:20:58,046 --> 00:20:59,746
Deathball!

412
00:21:08,289 --> 00:21:10,823
Okay, we'll call it a draw.

413
00:21:10,825 --> 00:21:12,792
Aaaaaaah!

414
00:21:13,628 --> 00:21:16,896
Buttercup! I thought you were
gone forever and ever

415
00:21:16,898 --> 00:21:18,598
and ever and ever and ever!

416
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,133
Sorry I got so carried away

417
00:21:20,135 --> 00:21:21,634
hanging out
with the derbytantes.

418
00:21:21,636 --> 00:21:24,570
I guess I forgot
who my real friends are.

419
00:21:24,572 --> 00:21:26,706
We're not just friends,
we're sisters.

420
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:30,243
Yeah! And we're sorry
we replaced you with morbucks!

421
00:21:30,245 --> 00:21:31,477
Wait, what?

422
00:21:31,479 --> 00:21:33,246
And so, once again,

423
00:21:33,248 --> 00:21:36,215
the day is saved
by the powerpuff girls!

424
00:21:36,217 --> 00:21:38,284
And deathball!
