about last night?

Ugh, why?

17
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:22,314

What did we do?

18
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:25,217
Ohh!
I can't remember anything!

19
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:27,486
And I remember every
grocery list I ever made.

20
00:01:27,488 --> 00:01:29,855
Hey, relax, would ya?

21
00:01:29,857 --> 00:01:32,958
I remember last night
like it was yesterday.

22
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,696
We had a slumber party,
ate a ton of candy,

23
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:42,668
um... Ate more candy,
then we...

24
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:43,936
Hmm...

25
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:46,572
Kidnapped an angry bull
and put him in our kitchen?

26
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:51,210
There's a bull in the kitchen!

27
00:01:51,212 --> 00:01:53,579
But he's not angry.
He's making breakfast.

28
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:56,448
Okay, okay, okay.
Maybe Bubbles knows.

29
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,184
Hmm.
Where is Bubbles?

30
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:00,752
Bubbles?

31
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:02,121
Bubbles?

32
00:02:02,123 --> 00:02:03,956
Bubbles?

33
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:05,657
Hey, dude.

34
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:06,859
Bubbles?

35
00:02:06,861 --> 00:02:08,327
Bubbles?

36
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:14,766
Bubbles?
I can't find her anywhere.

37
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:16,468
We lost Bubbles!?

38
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,370
Okay, okay.
Let's not panic.

39
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:20,606
We just have to
retrace our steps.

40
00:02:20,608 --> 00:02:23,308
We had a slumber party,
and, um...

41
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,177
Oh, yeah!
I remember now.

42
00:02:25,179 --> 00:02:29,148

Oh, thank you!

48
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:39,858
I'll allow myself
one piece of candy.

49
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,694
Mmm. I see why
they call it "fun size."

50
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:45,030
Hey, girls.
Don't stay up too late.

00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:48,867

city water park in the morning.

Go easy on the candy, girls.

00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:16,495
No!

55
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:19,565
I mean, don't worry, professor.

56
00:03:19,567 --> 00:03:21,833
We won't eat too much.
We promise.

57
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:24,236

00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:12,851

I'm running some errands,

74
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:15,687
so I'll be back to pick
all you girls up in one hour.

Oh, okay, professor.
S-sounds great.

00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:21,793
One hour?!
What are we gonna do?!

77
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:24,263
I knew we should've stopped
eating all of that candy!

78
00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:25,764
We should've gone to bed early!

79
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,599
We should've listened
to the professor!

80
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:30,902
Ugh! Pipe down,
captain shoulda.

81
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:32,871
Sorry.
But how are we gonna find bu...

82
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:34,740
Bubbles?!
Bubbles?!

83
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:38,143
Mojo!
Mojo!

84
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:40,078
What are you doing here?
Me?

85
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,514
This was your doing!
Although I do admit,

86
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:44,216
the adorable kitties
were my idea.

87
00:04:44,218 --> 00:04:49,354
I came by last night to enact
my latest, most ingenious plan.

88
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:53,925
I, mojo jojo, have once again

89
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:57,562
proven myself
a master of disguise.

90
00:04:57,564 --> 00:05:01,833
And I have assembled the most
evil of pizza toppings...

91
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:04,403
Forbidden artichokes
of the Sahara,

92
00:05:04,405 --> 00:05:07,139
transylvanian wurst pepperoni,

93
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:09,875
broccoli of the doomed,

94
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:12,644
and pineapple, 'cause I like it.

95
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:16,214
One bite, and the powerpuff
girls will fall beneath...

96
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:18,517
Hey, wait!
I'm not finished!

97
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,852
I said they'll fall...
They'll fall...

98
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:24,156
They... my power...

99
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:26,792
Curses!

100
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,564
Mojo!

101
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:36,568
Yeah, yeah,
but what about Bubbles?

102
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,670
Mojo does not know.

103
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,673
But he did hear something
about a monster and a bridge.

104
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:44,076
I remember.
We saved the bridge.

105
00:05:44,078 --> 00:05:46,378
But the monster
must have taken Bubbles.

106
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,146
Let's fly!

107
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:51,316
No, no!
No, wait!

108
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:54,519
Hey, I thought
we saved the bridge?

109
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,922
Oh, no, not you guys again.

110
00:05:56,924 --> 00:05:59,391
Hey!
What did you do with our sister?

111
00:05:59,393 --> 00:06:01,693
Stay away from me, you maniacs.

112
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:02,728
Maniacs?

113
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,663
You were the one
destroying the bridge!

114
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:07,366
Me? It was you!

115
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:13,138
Wow, guys.
This thing is really comin...

116
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,740
Whoa!

117
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:20,245
I guess we know
who the real monster is.

118
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:23,582
Plus, this bridge was supposed
to be fixed by this morning.

119
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:26,985
Now those orphans
can't visit puppy island.

120
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:30,355
Darn.
Maybe next year, kids.

121
00:06:30,357 --> 00:06:31,890
Aww!

122
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,759
Oh.
All right, all right.

123
00:06:33,761 --> 00:06:35,560
Look, we're trying
to find our sister.

124
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,062
Did you see where she went?

125
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:40,732
I overheard something about
always wanting to fight a bull.

126
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:44,169
Oh, yeah!
Bullfighting!

127
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:47,906
How can we fight
without our muse?

128
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,608
Without El toro?

129
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:55,414
Bullfighters crying?
What a bunch of dorks.

130
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:58,550
Mata-dorks.
Ha. Nice one.

131
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:01,420
Hey, dudes with hats!
Have you seen my sister?

132
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:04,423
La flor de la lucha!

133
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:06,425
She has returned!

134
00:07:06,427 --> 00:07:08,794
Uh, we were here last night?

135
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:12,564
None could forget
la flor de la lucha.

136
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:14,433
El flashback-o!

137
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:24,209
Ehh,
you don't look so tough to me!

138
00:07:24,211 --> 00:07:27,112
So why don't you just
bring it on, mister...

139
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:28,880
Aah!

140
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:32,350
Hey, Mr. bull!

141
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:34,186
What does that mean?

142
00:07:34,188 --> 00:07:38,123
I think it means, um,
he forgot his keys.

143
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:41,026
Blossom, churro me!

144
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:43,128
Sure thing!

145
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,064
Om-nom-nom-nom-nom-nom!

146
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,774
Touchdown!

147
00:07:55,776 --> 00:07:57,175
Yay!

148
00:07:57,177 --> 00:07:58,510
Ha, ha! Whoa!

149
00:07:58,512 --> 00:08:00,245
It's raining roses!

150
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:02,147
Ha, ha!

151
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:06,585
But El toro disappeared
after the fight.

152
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:12,123
Help us find El toro!

153
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,826
Well, first I'm gonna need you
to talk quieter.

154
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,162
El toro isn't lost.
He's in our kitchen.

155
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:19,498
He wasn't cooking, was he?

156
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,032
Yeah, I think so.

157
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:22,734
I opened a jar of marmalade
for him.

158
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:26,004
Marmalade?
He'll be gone for days.

159
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:30,008
No bullfighting today!

160
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,578
Today just isn't our day, kids.

161
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,013
Aww!

162
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,348
Oh, come on!

163
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,150
We're running out of time
to be first on rocktopus.

164
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:43,688
I think finding Bubbles is
more important than rocktopus.

165
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:46,491
Stop saying that!

166
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:48,159
I didn't even
say "rocktopus."

167
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:51,830
Whatever.
Let's just go.

168
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:53,565
All right. Where?

169
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:55,400
Hello.
I am still here.

170
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:59,671
La flor de la lucha did say
something about an arcade.

171
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:01,907
Oh, yeah!
The arcade!

172
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:04,276
Bubbles was in the ball pit.

173
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:08,980
Bubbles!

174
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:11,583
Where are all the balls?
Oh, you're too late.

175
00:09:11,585 --> 00:09:13,852
Those balls got changed out
this morning.

176
00:09:13,854 --> 00:09:15,520
Have you seen our sister?

177
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:17,222
She was in there last night.

178
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:19,624
Well, whatever was in there
got smashed...

179
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:21,059
...Rearranged...

180
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,861
...Melted down...

181
00:09:22,863 --> 00:09:25,096
Ohh!
...Bedazzled, embroidered,

182
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:28,533
squashed again,
and turned into novelty hats.

183
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:33,104
No!

184
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:38,543
What are we gonna
tell the professor?

185
00:09:38,545 --> 00:09:40,378
The truth, Buttercup.

186
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,380
I'll try anything once.

187
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:44,215
Ha, good one.

188
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:48,687
Oh, girls!
Where have you been?

189
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:50,455
You had me worried.

190
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:52,157
Professor, we're sorry!

191
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:54,659
You said not to eat too
much candy, but we did.

192
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:56,695
A-a-and we destroyed
a bridge.

193
00:09:56,697 --> 00:09:58,363
And Buttercup became a matador.

194
00:09:58,365 --> 00:10:00,699
And these orphans
kept following us around,

195
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:04,269
and... and...
And now Bubbles is...

196
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:05,937
A hat.

197
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,706
I'm a hat?

198
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,342
Bubbles!
Bubbles!

199
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:12,010
We were so worried!

200
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:14,279
Sounds like you all
had quite the night.

201
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:17,215
We shouldn't have
eaten so much candy.

202
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:18,550
We feel terrible.

203
00:10:18,552 --> 00:10:20,452
In more ways than one.
Blech.

204
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:25,457
Well, it seems you girls
certainly learned your lesson.

205
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:28,727
Now, then, I believe we can
still make it in time

206
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:29,961
for splash city.

207
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:34,099
Actually, professor,
we have a better idea.

208
00:10:34,101 --> 00:10:39,838
Thanks for the tickets to
splash city, powerpuff girls!

209
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,907
I am really proud of you girls,

210
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:44,976
giving away your tickets
like that.

211
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,278
Eh, rocktopus
ain't going nowhere.

212
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,680
Rocktopus!

213
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:53,151
Well, since the day's free,
why don't we get some ice cream?

214
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:56,988
Hello? Little help?

215
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,225
My cuticles are getting dry!
