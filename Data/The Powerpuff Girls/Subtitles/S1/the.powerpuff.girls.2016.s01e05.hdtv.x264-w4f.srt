Aaah!

39
00:01:43,871 --> 00:01:45,938
We're going to be
best friends forever,

40
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,606
and I'll name you "pointy".

41
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:49,808
Bubbles, the bus is
about to leave.

42
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,444
Whoa. How'd that horse
get loose?

43
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:53,912
Buttercup, this isn't a horse,

44
00:01:53,914 --> 00:01:56,348
it's my magical, mystical,
best friend unicorn.

45
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:00,452
Uh, hate to break it to you,
bubbles, but that's no unicorn.

46
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:02,020
That's a plain ol' pony.

47
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:04,957
No way. Ponies have
shorter legs. It's a Colt.

48
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,792
A Colt?
What's a Colt?

49
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:09,194
A baby horse.
Then what's a filly?

50
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:11,964
Uh...
A horse with... Attitude?

51
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:14,566
Either way,
it's definitely not a unicorn.

52
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:15,634
It's just...

53
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:19,138
sad.

54
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,573
Well excuse me!

55
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:24,376
I may not have a horn,
but I do have a heart!

56
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:27,946
And in that heart,
I know I'm a beautiful unicorn!

57
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:30,349
You can talk?

58
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:32,384
Yes, I can talk.
But who cares?

59
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:36,488
I'll never be anything more than
just Donny, the wannabe-corn.

60
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,023
Whoa, drama bomb.

61
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:41,226
We'll get the professor
to turn you into a real unicorn.

62
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:42,494
What?

63
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,129
Bubbles, I don't think
that's a good idea.

64
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:45,097
Of course it is.

65
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:47,166
You'll be a real, live unicorn!

66
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,333
Yeah!

67
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,903
And I'll be friends
with a real, live unicorn.

68
00:02:50,905 --> 00:02:52,204
Yeah!

69
00:02:52,206 --> 00:02:54,940
And everyone will see
how<i> wrong</i> they were!

70
00:02:54,942 --> 00:02:56,475
Bubbles!

71
00:02:56,477 --> 00:02:58,410
You're an incredible person!

72
00:02:59,947 --> 00:03:02,915
It'll be the most awesomest
thing that ever awesomed.

73
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:07,219
Speaking of awesome,

74
00:03:07,221 --> 00:03:11,456
the townsville pickle museum
is having its grand opening.

75
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:14,393
Here we have the world's
oldest pickle.

76
00:03:14,395 --> 00:03:18,497
And this a pickle made entirely
of used toothpicks...

77
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:20,199
My toothpicks.

78
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:23,202
And here we have our hall
of pickledents,

79
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:25,971
which are pickles
in the shape of presidents.

80
00:03:25,973 --> 00:03:28,674
This one resembles Dolly parton.

81
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:32,344
Hey! Dolly parton
was never president!

82
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:34,846
Well, not yet, anyway.

83
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:38,317
Gee, bubbles, I don't know.

84
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,819
Professor, please!

85
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:44,590
Well, I suppose I could
try and turn him into a unicorn

86
00:03:44,592 --> 00:03:46,291
using the transmorgrifying ray

87
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:48,794
I just happened to finish
this afternoon.

88
00:03:48,796 --> 00:03:51,563
But it hasn't been
properly tested.

89
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:54,566
Professor, he needs this.

90
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:57,903
<i>I need this!</i>

91
00:03:57,905 --> 00:03:59,805
Well, it's up to you, Donny.

92
00:03:59,807 --> 00:04:02,007
Is this something
you want to try?

93
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:03,775
As long
as my b.F.F. Bubbles

94
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:06,778
says it's a good idea,
I am down.

95
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,614
Completely trust you, brah.

96
00:04:08,616 --> 00:04:10,415
I've detailed out
a comprehensive list

97
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:13,285
of possible risks and side
effects from this procedure.

98
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:14,319
Okay.

99
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:15,354
I need you to be aware

100
00:04:15,356 --> 00:04:16,855
of all the consequences.
Yep!

101
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:18,056
This is your body,

102
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:19,858
and it's a serious choice.
Got it!

103
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,860
Thoroughly weigh your options...
Uh-huh.

104
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:24,663
As you read through
this document in it's entirety.

105
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,666
Eh, I skimmed it.

106
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,238
This is gonna be
the best day of my life!

107
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,973
Thank you, bubbles!

108
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:36,875
You're welcome, Donny!

109
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:39,878
All right, girls,
vision-safety time.

110
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:48,220
So...
How beautiful am I?

111
00:04:48,222 --> 00:04:49,888
Um, well...

112
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,324
You look very...
Majestical.

113
00:04:52,326 --> 00:04:55,060
Honestly, that's not as bad
as I thought it was going to be.

114
00:04:55,062 --> 00:04:58,263
Oh, man.
I feel different already.

115
00:04:58,265 --> 00:04:59,531
Aah!

116
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:02,734
Um, professor?

117
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:08,540
Bubbles, what have you
done to me?!

118
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:10,442
Best two out of three?

119
00:05:10,444 --> 00:05:11,843
No! Ragh!

120
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:13,378
I hate science!

121
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:17,249
Wait!

122
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:20,018
Donny, come back!

123
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,720
O...Kay.

124
00:05:21,722 --> 00:05:23,689
Now it's as bad as I thought
it was gonna be.

125
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:25,724
How could you hate science?

126
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:27,526
That's what you got out of that?

127
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:34,232
Hey, what is that?

128
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:38,837
Don't look at me!

129
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:40,839
Oh, no.

130
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:43,108
No, no, no!

131
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,677
Not again!

132
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,747
No, no, no!

133
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:54,553
Huh. Bigfoot.

134
00:05:54,555 --> 00:05:56,455
I knew it.

135
00:05:57,925 --> 00:06:00,525
This is the crystal pickle
of despair.

136
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,327
Legend has it that if it breaks,

137
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:05,797
bad luck would rain down
upon us forever.

138
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:08,633
A freak!

139
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:11,336
I am not a freak!

140
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:14,473
Oh, that reminds me...
I've gotta mail a letter.

141
00:06:14,475 --> 00:06:15,674
Ooh, uh, hello.

142
00:06:20,147 --> 00:06:23,682
Donny, you have to calm down!

143
00:06:23,684 --> 00:06:25,283
Calm down?!

144
00:06:25,285 --> 00:06:26,618
Look at me.

145
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,019
I'm a freak.

146
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:31,790
We are no longer b.F.F.S!

147
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:39,865
No!

148
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:43,635
Whoa.
He's a freak.

149
00:06:43,637 --> 00:06:45,804
He is not a freak!

150
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:47,172
He is my friend!

151
00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:50,842
Well, your "friend" is
terrorizing the city.

152
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:53,111
Just let me talk to him.

153
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:55,213
I knew this was a bad idea.

154
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:58,583
Donny!

155
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,452
I'm so sorry.

156
00:07:00,454 --> 00:07:01,920
This is all my fault.

157
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,321
I put you in danger

158
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:05,891
just because I wanted
to be friends with a unicorn

159
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:08,460
and prove to everyone
they were real.

160
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:10,562
Well, they're not real!

161
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:11,963
You were wrong!

162
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:14,199
We were both wrong!

163
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:18,470
Listen to me.

164
00:07:18,472 --> 00:07:21,406
Unicorns<i> are</i> real,
and this proves it.

165
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:23,775
Because I summoned you.

166
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:26,678
And you appeared.

167
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,147
Stop blowing that stupid horn!

168
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:31,016
Donny, in your heart of hearts,

169
00:07:31,018 --> 00:07:34,319
you know you are
a real, live unicorn!

170
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:38,056
No! In my heart,
I know I'm a monster!

171
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:44,930
Oh, no! Bubbles!

172
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:46,364
I...Didn't mean to.

173
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:49,401
Oh, no.
What have I done?!

174
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,871
Aah!

175
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:54,072
Whee!

176
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:57,042
Museums sure are exhilarating.

177
00:07:57,044 --> 00:07:59,144
Bubbles?!
Are you okay?

178
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:01,179
Wha...
Where's Donny?

179
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:03,849
I'm sorry, bubbles, he...

180
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:09,688
Huh?

181
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:13,325
He's turned back into a pony!

182
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:14,593
But how?

183
00:08:14,595 --> 00:08:16,962
Um, you guys...

184
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:24,970
I can't believe
this is happening!

185
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,242
Oops. My bad.

186
00:08:30,244 --> 00:08:32,811
Donny.
Will he be okay?

187
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:35,347
He'll be just fine,
lady bubbles.

188
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:37,516
We heard the call
of your summoning horn.

189
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:38,750
Sorry we're late.

190
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:40,719
Somebody didn't want
to use the GPS.

191
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:42,888
I knew a shortcut.

192
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,222
Well, I thought I did.

193
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:45,490
Stallions.

194
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:47,125
Wait, which ones are stallions?

195
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:49,928
They're like colts, but...
Oh, forget it. Who cares?

196
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,563
B-bubbles?

197
00:08:51,565 --> 00:08:53,565
Donny, I'm so sorry.

198
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:55,567
I feel terrible.

199
00:08:55,569 --> 00:08:57,068
I'm sorry, too, bubbles.

200
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,970
I blamed you, but, heck,

201
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:01,306
I didn't think about
the consequences, either.

202
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:03,508
I know you were only
trying to help me.

203
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:07,512
I mean, dude, I<i> so</i> wanted
to be a unicorn, too.

204
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:11,283
But, Donny,
you already are a unicorn.

205
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:14,019
Uh, okay, bubbles,
I get the sentiment,

206
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:16,555
but, honestly, this is getting
kind of redundant.

207
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:18,757
No, she's right, Donny.

208
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:22,093
Mom? What are you doing hanging
out with a bunch of unicorns?

209
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:24,429
You're old enough now
to know the truth.

210
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:27,999
I had to wait until you went
on an intense journey

211
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:30,835
of adolescent
self-discovery.

212
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:35,240
Whoa! What is even
going on right now?!

213
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:37,776
I mean, you probably could've
figured it out sooner

214
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:39,911
if you'd ever
cut that hair of yours.

215
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,947
What is that, a zit?

216
00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:43,248
It's a horn!

217
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,017
Oh, Donny, I'm so happy for you.

218
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,853
This was the best day ever!

219
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,857
And be sure
to grab a pickle-chute,

220
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:54,526
available at the gift shop.

221
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:02,334
Oh, what a world!

222
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:13,278
Oh, thank you,
mythical unicorns.

223
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,548
Donny, it's time for you
to say good-bye.

224
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,816
We're all needed back

225
00:10:17,818 --> 00:10:20,685
at the unicorn coalition
alliance brigade headquarters.

226
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:22,520
It sounds made up,
but it's totally not.

227
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:25,924
Bubbles, you are my b.F.F.
<i>For reals.</i>

228
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:30,095
It's beautiful!

229
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:34,499
Use this to summon me anytime.

230
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:35,800
Or just shoot me a text.

231
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,669
You know I will all the time!

232
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:40,505
Ugh, hopefully not <i>all</i> the time.

233
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:44,175
Bye-bye, Donny!
- We'll miss you.

234
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:46,311
I actually connected
with you guys!

235
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:48,680
Told you unicorns were real.

236
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:51,883
And so,
the day was saved thanks to...

238
