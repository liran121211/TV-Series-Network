Now, class, I've got a really
cool surprise for you.

12
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:35,584
Is it an ice-cream party?

13
00:00:35,586 --> 00:00:36,252
No.

14
00:00:36,254 --> 00:00:37,486
Early-dismissal party?

15
00:00:37,488 --> 00:00:39,922
No. Even cooler than that.

16
00:00:39,924 --> 00:00:40,990
Hmm.

17
00:00:40,992 --> 00:00:42,258
Ufo party?!

18
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,993
What is it, Ms. keane?

19
00:00:43,995 --> 00:00:45,861
Ms. keane has left the building.

20
00:00:51,636 --> 00:00:53,969
My name is sansa syntax,

21
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:55,805
the grammar wizard!

22
00:00:55,807 --> 00:01:00,309
And it's time to begin
this year's language unit!

23
00:01:00,311 --> 00:01:02,144
Yay.

24
00:01:02,146 --> 00:01:05,014
What?!
That's the opposite of cool.

25
00:01:05,016 --> 00:01:07,350
Who can tell me a little bit

26
00:01:07,352 --> 00:01:11,053
about the magic
of dangling participles?

27
00:01:11,055 --> 00:01:13,823
Why don't you check
your spell book?

28
00:01:15,193 --> 00:01:16,525
Very funny, buttercup.

29
00:01:16,527 --> 00:01:18,494
But please save your comments
for later.

30
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:20,196
We need to get through this.

31
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:25,234
Now, do any of you know
when to use "you and I"

32
00:01:25,236 --> 00:01:27,370
instead of "you and me"?

33
00:01:27,372 --> 00:01:31,207
<i>Don't ask me. Eye don't know.</i>

34
00:01:31,209 --> 00:01:33,509
Buttercup, please!

35
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:35,678
<i>I know this isn't what you
wanted to do today,</i>

36
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,514
but I am trying hard
to make it fun for you guys.

37
00:01:38,516 --> 00:01:41,183
The grammar unit
is really important, and...

38
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:43,886
- Grammar?
- More like

39
00:01:46,991 --> 00:01:48,858
okay, buttercup!

40
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,226
That's it!

41
00:01:50,228 --> 00:01:52,661
There is a time and a place
for goofing off,

42
00:01:52,663 --> 00:01:54,096
and it's not in my classroom.

43
00:01:54,098 --> 00:01:55,531
I hate to do this,

44
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:59,568
but I'm going to have
to send you to the...

45
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:02,204
Principal's...

46
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:04,540
Rainbow!

47
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:07,576
Wow. What was I saying?

48
00:02:07,578 --> 00:02:09,712
Uh, probably nothing important.

49
00:02:09,714 --> 00:02:11,080
Oh, yeah!

50
00:02:11,082 --> 00:02:14,283
I was just about to give you
a hug,

51
00:02:14,285 --> 00:02:18,421
because you're just such
a special little lady.

52
00:02:18,423 --> 00:02:21,524
Special?
I thought I was being bad.

53
00:02:21,526 --> 00:02:22,391
Yes!

54
00:02:22,393 --> 00:02:24,927
You're so good at being bad.

55
00:02:24,929 --> 00:02:29,098
You always do what you want,
and it's so much fun!

56
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,400
Let's all do what we want!

57
00:02:31,402 --> 00:02:34,136
Yay!

58
00:02:34,138 --> 00:02:36,372
I want to sit upside down.

59
00:02:36,374 --> 00:02:38,240
And I want to eat candy.

60
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:39,775
What about the grammar lesson?

61
00:02:39,777 --> 00:02:42,244
I thought it was, like,
really important or whatever.

62
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:44,780
Grammar can wait till next year.

63
00:02:44,782 --> 00:02:48,417
Now, how's about that
early-dismissal party?

64
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:49,251
Okay!

65
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:50,486
Yay!

66
00:02:50,488 --> 00:02:53,289
Whoo!
Early-dismissal candy party!

67
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:55,124
Today is awesome!

68
00:02:55,126 --> 00:02:57,660
Today is the absolute worst!

69
00:02:57,662 --> 00:02:59,829
We made dioramas
in geography class,

70
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:00,896
and I worked really hard,

71
00:03:00,898 --> 00:03:02,932
and the teacher gave me
an a-plus!

72
00:03:02,934 --> 00:03:05,301
And that's a problem why?

73
00:03:05,303 --> 00:03:08,270
He gave everyone an a-plus!

74
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:10,773
I sneezed in a box.

75
00:03:10,775 --> 00:03:11,907
Aah!

76
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:14,944
If grades are meaningless, then

77
00:03:14,946 --> 00:03:17,146
I am meaningless!

78
00:03:17,148 --> 00:03:19,782
I can't live in this world!

79
00:03:19,784 --> 00:03:21,584
Mellow out, man.

80
00:03:21,586 --> 00:03:23,819
Everyone's just having
a good time.

81
00:03:23,821 --> 00:03:25,120
Check this out.

82
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:28,624

Buttercup, that was hilarious!

84
00:03:32,463 --> 00:03:35,197
I want to give you a big hug!

85
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:37,466
No way, Barry!
Get ahold of yourself.

86
00:03:37,468 --> 00:03:39,168
Barry wants a hug!

87
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:41,203
Hug party!

88
00:03:41,205 --> 00:03:44,807
Buttercup, I think something
is amiss in townsville.

89
00:03:46,177 --> 00:03:47,476
He-e-y!

90
00:03:47,478 --> 00:03:49,311
I wanted to go first.

91
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:52,047
Hey! I wanted to go first, too!

92
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:53,916
Yay!

93
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:57,720
Hey. I want to go outside today.

94
00:03:57,722 --> 00:04:01,557
And I want to let you
go outside today!

00:04:01,559 --> 00:04:03,292
Yay!

96
00:04:05,363 --> 00:04:07,863
Huh. Have you seen bubbles?

97
00:04:11,202 --> 00:04:12,902
I never thought
I would say this,

98
00:04:12,904 --> 00:04:16,372
but I can't handle
any more hugs.

99
00:04:16,374 --> 00:04:18,807
Why is everyone acting
so insane?

100
00:04:18,809 --> 00:04:21,744
I'm not sure.
Let's go ask the professor.

101
00:04:21,746 --> 00:04:24,179
He's the sanest person we know.

102
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:25,748
Ya-ay!

103
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,850
Whee!

104
00:04:27,852 --> 00:04:30,819
Oh, you can't get me! Look out!

00:04:32,023 --> 00:04:33,355

113
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:50,940

00:07:49,186 --> 00:07:50,252
♪ Je ne sais quoi ♪

187
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,256
Ugh. Gross.

188
00:07:54,258 --> 00:07:56,759
Come on, buttercup.

189
00:07:56,761 --> 00:07:58,794
You love to party.

190
00:07:58,796 --> 00:08:01,196
Isn't this what you wanted?

191
00:08:01,198 --> 00:08:02,431
You guys, stop!

192
00:08:02,433 --> 00:08:03,732
This isn't you!

193
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:05,400
The town needs us.

194
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:07,970
I'm sure they're fine.

195
00:08:12,076 --> 00:08:16,612
I guess buttercup just doesn't
want anyone to have fun.

196
00:08:16,614 --> 00:08:18,046
That's not true.

197
00:08:18,048 --> 00:08:21,083
But there's a time and a place
for having fun

198
00:08:21,085 --> 00:08:22,284
and doing what you want,

199
00:08:22,286 --> 00:08:24,920
just like Ms. keane
was saying earlier.

200
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:27,990
Whoa. I guess she was right.

201
00:08:27,992 --> 00:08:30,592
I was trying to be funny
and screw around

202
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:32,661
when she was trying to teach.

203
00:08:32,663 --> 00:08:36,465
Uh-oh.
Introspection bums allegro out.

204
00:08:36,467 --> 00:08:37,332
Oh, man.

205
00:08:37,334 --> 00:08:38,667
Having fun is okay,

206
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:41,336
but not if it hurts
someone's feelings.

207
00:08:41,338 --> 00:08:43,839
You're ruining my chill vibes.

208
00:08:43,841 --> 00:08:48,110
Party lobsters, fix her!

209
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,648
You're harshing the party vibe.

210
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:55,584
I know! Give me a hug!

211
00:08:55,586 --> 00:08:57,019
Ugh. No way, man!

212
00:08:57,021 --> 00:08:58,020
I'm having a moment.

213
00:08:58,022 --> 00:09:01,957
Hug me!
Hugs make everything better!

214
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:03,492
Dude, no!

215
00:09:03,494 --> 00:09:06,295
Just one little hug.

216
00:09:06,297 --> 00:09:07,763
Back off!

217
00:09:10,334 --> 00:09:11,266
What the...

218
00:09:11,268 --> 00:09:12,601
Hug me!

219
00:09:12,603 --> 00:09:13,702
Give me a hug!

220
00:09:13,704 --> 00:09:15,304
Get away from me, you creep!

221
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:23,011
Come on. Just one little hug.

222
00:09:23,013 --> 00:09:26,381
I said no!

223
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:30,886
Huh?

224
00:09:32,456 --> 00:09:33,789
Whoa.

225
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:36,959
Buttercup, what happened?

226
00:09:36,961 --> 00:09:39,328
I just want to party.

227
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:41,563
I just want to party.

228
00:09:41,565 --> 00:09:43,465
I just want to party.

229
00:09:43,467 --> 00:09:44,733
I just want to party.

230
00:09:44,735 --> 00:09:45,834
I just want to party.

231
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:46,869
I just want to party.

232
00:09:46,871 --> 00:09:48,170
I just want to party.

233
00:09:48,172 --> 00:09:48,737
Uh-oh.

234
00:09:48,739 --> 00:09:50,405
Party, party.

235
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,379
Wow.

236
00:09:57,381 --> 00:09:58,914
Guess the party's over.

237
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:00,182
Nice.

238
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:03,185
I hope the town
is back to normal.

239
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:06,221
Well, now that
the town is back to normal,

240
00:10:06,223 --> 00:10:09,024
we can continue
our grammar quest

241
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:11,927
into the realm of conjunctions,

242
00:10:11,929 --> 00:10:16,098
the most used conjunctions
being "and," "or," and "but."

243
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:20,202
First, let's reveal
the mysteries of "but."

244
00:10:20,204 --> 00:10:23,605
There are many times
when "buts" are useful.

245
00:10:23,607 --> 00:10:25,874
Does anyone have
any "but" questions?

246
00:10:27,378 --> 00:10:28,844
Yes, buttercup?

247
00:10:28,846 --> 00:10:31,680
Are you going to make fun
of my lesson again?

248
00:10:31,682 --> 00:10:32,748
No way.

249
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,049
Actually, I was wondering

250
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:36,051
if you could remind me
of the difference

251
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:38,720
between "you and I"
and "you and me."

252
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:40,923
Wow. I am impressed, buttercup.

253
00:10:40,925 --> 00:10:43,892
You're actually taking
this seriously for once.

254
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:47,362
And here I thought you were gonna
make fun of something I said.

255
00:10:47,364 --> 00:10:48,730
I would never.

256
00:10:50,434 --> 00:10:52,935
And so, once again,
the day is saved.

257
00:10:52,937 --> 00:10:55,437
Thanks to the powerpuff girls!

258
00:10:55,439 --> 00:10:56,905
And the importance of grammar.

259
00:10:56,907 --> 00:11:01,076
"But" questions!

260
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:02,411
Whoo!

261
00:11:02,413 --> 00:11:04,112
That felt good.
