1
00:00:01,602 --> 00:00:02,701
Ohh, yeah!

2
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,121
Oh! Yeah!

3
00:00:28,062 --> 00:00:30,262
Hey, there, groovy people.

4
00:00:30,264 --> 00:00:32,931
Today is the Townsville
zen-aissance fair.

5
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:35,234
It's all peace and love and...

6
00:00:35,236 --> 00:00:36,535
ugh! I hate this place.

7
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:39,004
Why did you guys drag me
to this lame-fest?

8
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:40,739
Where's the monster trucks?

9
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:42,441
Where's the alligator wrestling?

10
00:00:42,443 --> 00:00:44,510
Where is anything cool
around here?!

11
00:00:44,512 --> 00:00:46,545
Buttercup, you always have

12
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:48,914
a really bad attitude
about everything.

13
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:50,215
Hmm. Thanks!

14
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:53,619
You have to learn
how to relax a little.

15
00:00:53,621 --> 00:00:54,620
Oh!

16
00:00:54,622 --> 00:00:56,722
Like this guy.

17
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:59,258
"Let chillaxi
help you relaxi!"

18
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,161
Check it out.
He's got a free class tomorrow.

19
00:01:02,163 --> 00:01:05,264
I've got a better idea.

20
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:06,899
Ooh!

21
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:10,436
Why would I want to take a class

22
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:13,272
that teaches you to sit
on your butt and be boring?

23
00:01:13,274 --> 00:01:16,308
Meditation isn't
just sitting and being boring!

24
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,444
It's about achieving inner peace

25
00:01:18,446 --> 00:01:22,114
and not getting distracted
by what's going on around you.

26
00:01:22,116 --> 00:01:24,316
Wow.
He's good.

27
00:01:24,318 --> 00:01:28,954
Attention, citizens
of wimpsville... I am...

28
00:01:28,956 --> 00:01:30,889
Manboy!

29
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:33,859
Manboy?

30
00:01:33,861 --> 00:01:35,727
All the power of a man

31
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:39,998
in the body of a boy.

32
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:44,870
Ewww!

33
00:01:44,872 --> 00:01:46,638
This town used to be
a man's town!

34
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:49,174
Where men were men!

35
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:51,143
And boys were men!

36
00:01:51,145 --> 00:01:53,045
Townsville needs to get back to

37
00:01:53,047 --> 00:01:54,546
its manly roots.

38
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:57,950
And if that means destroying
this hippie carnival,

39
00:01:57,952 --> 00:01:59,485
then so be it!

40
00:01:59,487 --> 00:02:03,422
Unless there's somebody here
man enough to stop me!

41
00:02:03,424 --> 00:02:04,890
Nah, we're good.

42
00:02:04,892 --> 00:02:08,360
This day finally
got interesting.

43
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:09,761
If you're lookin' for a fight,

44
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:13,632
ol' Buttercup can satisfy
your need for a beatdown!

45
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:22,441
Why don't you go play
with your dollies, Princess?

46
00:02:22,443 --> 00:02:26,311
"Princess"?
Did you just call me Princess?!

47
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:29,948
Uh-oh.
Listen Princess, I...

48
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,750
waaaah!

49
00:02:33,154 --> 00:02:37,723
Think you can fight me
like a man, Princess?!

50
00:02:37,725 --> 00:02:40,859
Don't... Call me... Princess!

51
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,432
Unh!

52
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:52,604
Your girly ways are no match
for my manbot.

53
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:56,742
I control him
purely with my manly will!

54
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:03,348
I see great pain in your future.

55
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,184
Aah!

56
00:03:05,186 --> 00:03:07,419
That'll be 5 bucks.

57
00:03:12,092 --> 00:03:15,427
Don't... Call me... Princess!

58
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:17,896
Whoa-aaah!

59
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:19,965
You throw like a girl!

60
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:23,702
Nobody calls me Princess!

61
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:26,038
You!

62
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:29,341
I'll show you Princess!

63
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:36,949
I see more pain in your future.

64
00:03:36,951 --> 00:03:39,251
What? Oh, no.
No, no, no!

65
00:03:39,253 --> 00:03:40,619
Oww!

66
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:42,020
5 bucks, please.

67
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:51,797
Buttercup...

68
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:53,131
Buttercup...

69
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:56,535
Whoa!
What happened?

70
00:03:56,537 --> 00:03:57,669
You happened!

71
00:03:57,671 --> 00:03:59,371
This is
the third time this month

72
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:01,006
you've had an episode like this.

73
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:02,307
Your uncontrollable anger

74
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:04,343
is beginning to be
a serious problem!

75
00:04:04,345 --> 00:04:07,012
Oh, please.
It's not like I hurt anyone.

76
00:04:07,014 --> 00:04:08,747
Isn't that right, Bubbles?

77
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:12,751
Oh, man.
<i>I</i> did that?

78
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:15,087
Maybe I do have a problem.

79
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:16,855
It's okay, Buttercup.

80
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:19,057
I think I've got an idea.

81
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:25,163
Welcome to chillaxi's
dojo of chillaxitude.

82
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:27,766
In this class,
I will teach you how to find

83
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:31,470
that missing piece of inner
peace you've been peacing for.

84
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:34,039
Is there gonna be a quiz?

85
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,073
Nope.

86
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:36,441
Ooh!
Can there be a quiz?!

87
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,343
Mnh, that's not really the...

88
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:41,747
Mr. guru, on the quiz,
can I use my lucky bunny pencil?

89
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:43,482
- No.
- Aww.

90
00:04:43,484 --> 00:04:45,484
No, like,
there isn't gonna be a quiz,

91
00:04:45,486 --> 00:04:47,619
so there's no need
to use a pencil on it.

92
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,888
That's okay, Bubbles.
I brought pens.

93
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,490
Uh, why did you bring pens?

94
00:04:51,492 --> 00:04:53,825
In case there's a quiz.
I always have pens.

95
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:57,229
So, you just walk around
looking for quizzes?

96
00:04:57,231 --> 00:04:58,930
I don't understand the question.

97
00:04:58,932 --> 00:05:02,134
Now you see why I'm so angry
all the time?

98
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:09,041
There are two sides
of all of us... fire and water.

99
00:05:09,043 --> 00:05:11,310
Fire is all about force.

100
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:14,746
Water is force without effort.

101
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:21,253
To be at peace, one must find
balance between fire and water.

102
00:05:21,255 --> 00:05:23,322
Nice presentation.

103
00:05:24,692 --> 00:05:27,826
Okay.
Now show me your flow.

104
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:30,128
Fl-o-o-o-ow...

105
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,831
Fl-o-o-o-ow...

106
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,933
Fl-o-oh-oh-ohh!

107
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:36,001
Oof!

108
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:38,236
I think I see your problem.

109
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:42,207
You are very gifted,
but your anger is blocking you.

110
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:44,343
What do you know about anger,
anyway?

111
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:46,611
I know plenty.

112
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:50,115
I was once the greatest
rv salesman in the world.

113
00:05:50,117 --> 00:05:51,917
But I had a mortal enemy...

114
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,618
the tube man.

115
00:05:55,356 --> 00:05:56,722
Rv sales were my life,

116
00:05:56,724 --> 00:05:59,524
and that tube man
made a mockery of my career.

117
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,026
Raaah!

118
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:05,897
When I came to, I had beaten up
every tube man for 50 miles.

119
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:07,132
Whoa.

120
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:09,735
I bet you felt great
after that, huh?

121
00:06:09,737 --> 00:06:10,902
No, Buttercup.

122
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:14,740
My rage burned a hole
inside of me, just like you.

123
00:06:14,742 --> 00:06:16,608
I want you to have this.

124
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,412
Uh... Jewelry's not really
my thing.

125
00:06:20,414 --> 00:06:23,815
Every time you feel your anger
burning inside you,

126
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:27,052
I want you to concentrate
on this pendant.

127
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:30,188
Now... Show me your flow.

128
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:32,724
Whoa. Whoa!

129
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:36,294
<i>Feel the flow, dude.</i>

130
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:43,835
Fl-o-o-o-o-ow...

131
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:44,903
Very good.

132
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,739
You're on your path
to inner peace.

133
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,174
Awesome!

134
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:50,509
Whoa!

135
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:51,343
Unh!

136
00:06:51,345 --> 00:06:55,414
I mean, namaste.

137
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:01,253
Nemesis, thy name is Buttercup!

138
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:04,189
No girly girl bests Manboy!

139
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:13,799
This city will know
its true glory

140
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:17,903
after I defeat
its false champion... Buttercup!

141
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:28,079
Aw, man.
That was gonna be so cool.

142
00:07:32,386 --> 00:07:34,453
Buttercup's been like this
all week.

143
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:36,054
It's kind of weirding me out.

144
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:39,090
Thanks for grooving with us,
beautiful people.

145
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:42,861
We'd like to thank tom's
tofu hut for providing lunch.

146
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:44,362
So... Buttercup...

147
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:46,431
I'm no longer Buttercup.

148
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:48,366
I'm moonbeam sunshine.

149
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:50,068
That's an oxymoron.

150
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:55,740
Attention,
citizens of wussville!

151
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:57,409
Great.
Not him again.

152
00:07:57,411 --> 00:08:02,314
I, Manboy,
born of brawn and musk,

153
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:07,285
declare this
the city... Of... Mansville!

154
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:11,389
Oh, yeah?
You and what army?!

155
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:14,326
I'm glad you asked.
This army!

156
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:20,265
A steak army?

157
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:21,266
Ew!

158
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:23,335
Ugh. Men...

159
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:24,769
Fear not, dear sister.

160
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:27,739
I shall solve this
with the power of love.

161
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:29,841
What is even going on right now?

162
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:34,946
What darkens your cloud,
he-child?

163
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:36,481
You!

164
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:39,518
You're not going to
wreck my plans again.

165
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,254
And this time...
It's personal.

166
00:08:42,256 --> 00:08:45,524
But not too personal,
like in an emotional way!

167
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:48,860
I will not fight you.
It's not my way anymore.

168
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:53,331
Well, a man's got to do
what a man's got to do.

169
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:03,275
Where am I?

170
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:05,810
What truth do you seek?

171
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:08,146
I tried being angry...
fail.

172
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:10,549
I tried being nice...
double fail.

173
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:13,018
Hit me. That's not
my thing anymore.

174
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,052
Fire.

175
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,053
What are you...

176
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,087
fire.

177
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:17,055
Hey!

178
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,423
Fire!

179
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:21,459
All right, you asked for it,
captain wiggles.

180
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:24,195
Water...

181
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:26,264
And fire.

182
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:28,066
Water...

183
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,868
And fire!

184
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:30,936
You see...

185
00:09:30,938 --> 00:09:35,106
Fire and water...
you must be both.

186
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,477
Unh!

187
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:42,247
Buttercup, stop playing around!

188
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:45,550
Aah!

189
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:49,020
Time for
a well-balanced beatdown.

190
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:52,324
Here's some water...

191
00:09:52,326 --> 00:09:54,025
And some fire!

192
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:57,095
Tenderizing these steaks
is too easy.

193
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,496
Oof!

194
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:02,634
Okay, one more time.

195
00:10:02,636 --> 00:10:04,703
Fire plus water...

196
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:05,937
Yeah, you already said...

197
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:08,073
fire plus water...

198
00:10:08,075 --> 00:10:10,408
yeah, I know, but...
fire and water!

199
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,510
Okay, but...
look, that's all I got!

200
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:14,746
I'm just a tubeman!

201
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:20,285
Okay, hair beast, let's tangle.

202
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,253
Water and fire.

203
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:25,256
Water and fire.

204
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:27,525
Water and fire.

205
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:34,232
Aw, man, I...

206
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:36,368
Whoa!

207
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,702
Aaaaah!

208
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:38,704
Oof!

209
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:45,343
Hey, there, groovy sisters.

210
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:46,911
Buttercup!

211
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:49,714
I guess we'll have to get used
to a more peaceful Buttercup.

212
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:51,416
I'm a changed powerpuff.

213
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:52,917
No more bad attitudes.

214
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:55,553
Except for
the zen-aissance fair.

215
00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:57,656
And what's up
with all those lame hippies?

216
00:10:57,658 --> 00:10:59,658
And I don't even like tofu!
