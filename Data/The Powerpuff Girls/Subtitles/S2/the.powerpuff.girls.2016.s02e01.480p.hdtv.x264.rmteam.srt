Donny, I didn't know
you could teleport.

61
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,270
Yeah, I can teleport
lots of places,

62
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,610
just as long
as they're bowling alleys.

63
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:41,180
I call the piggy ball!

64
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,150
Ooh, let me polish it up
with Mr. Used Tissue.

65
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,980

to pack the essentials.

No bowling!

67
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,990
Way to run away, Blockhead!

68
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:53,190
Now the robot thinks
we're wusses.

69
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,320
Why you got to be
such a chicken?

70
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:57,390
I'm not a chicken.

71
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,300
I just have
chicken-like qualities.

72
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,770
Donny, it's time
to tell us what's going on.

73
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:05,100
All right.

74
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,570
But you better
go to the bathroom now...

75
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:08,870
I don't want to have to
stop my story in the middle.

76
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,770
Tell us already!

77

<i>At that moment,</i>

122

<i>I knew I was looking
at beings of pure evil.</i>

123
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,960
<i>So I did
what any brave soul would do.</i>

00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,570
Get him!

126
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,240
And then that killer-corn thing
was like, "Pew! Pew! Pew!"

127
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,640
And I was like, "Aah! Aah! Aah!"

128
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,340
And you were like,
"Well, I don't know,"

129
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,640
and then, "Brrrnnn,"
and we're here!

130
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,850
Oh, Donny,
you did the brave thing...

131
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:06,110
by running away like a coward.

132
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,980
Seems like a trend with<i> you.</i>

133
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,920
We'll find a way to fix this.

00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,980
Unh!

184
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:57,720
Bubbles!

185
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,820
Nooooooooooo!

186
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:07,330
Your friend is very noble
but very much a dum-dum.

187
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:12,770
You are the only thing standing
in the way of my master's plan.

188
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:20,210
Prepare to be annihilated!

189
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:21,940
Aww, come on, dude.

190
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,210
Let's make a deal!

191
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:24,680
How about, um...?

192
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,880
How about...

193
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,980
you leave us alone
for this cool game token?

194
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:31,350
Or how about this bubble bath?

195
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:34,160
Or this red car
missing its wheels,

196
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,890
presumably on purpose.

197
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,220
How about a pot holder?

198
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,390
Or stock model mug?
Or this used tissue?

199
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,430
Or... or... or, um...

200
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:43,970
<i>Adios,</i> Donny.

201
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:46,900
Or... Or this second-place
macaroni trophy?!

202
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:53,440
♪

203
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,980
He is...

204
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:00,210
the chosen...

205
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,250
one...

206
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,590
Whoa!

207
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:08,520
He was a robot the whole time!

208
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,430
Donny, what... what happened?

209
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,930
Did you destroy the big baddie?

210
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:15,560
Yes? No?

211
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,230
Did you want me to?

212
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:21,240
Guys, we can celebrate later,
after we save Unicorn Land.

213
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,600
Psh, yeah.

214
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:24,070
W-We can't go to Unicorn Land.

215
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:26,270
Four more of those things
came out of that mirror!

216
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,080
Don't you remember
my excellent story?

217
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,340
But Don-Bon,

218
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:32,080
what about your friends
and your family?

219
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,250
My family?

220
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,620
We got to go.

221
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,280
Plus, I left my lunch
on the counter!

222
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:38,920
And it's string-cheese day!

223
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,060
Looks like the Powerpuff Girls
are going to...

224
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,390
Unicorn Land!

225
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:46,660
So... how do we get there?

226
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:50,930
I'll teleport us to the
bowling alley in Unicorn City!

227
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:52,670
Hang on!

228
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:56,970
Whoo!

229
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:59,540
We can totally get a game in
before we have to...

230
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,440
save Unicorn Land?

231
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:04,380
You know, there's something
different here,

232
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,150
but I can't really
put my hoof on it.

233
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,450
You think?

234
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:08,750
Freeze!

235
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,450
Man, this is just not my day.

236
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,120
Don't move!

237
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,590
Oh, no! This is it!

238
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,530
I never got to warn my mother

239
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:20,090
that Unicorn Land
is under attack!

240
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,500
Don't worry, Donny.

241
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,100
She already knows.

242
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,230
Hiya, Donny! Pbht!

243
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,700
M-Mom? Axel? Gretel?

244
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,140
We came to tell you
Unicorn Land is under attack!

245
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,340
Yeah, Donny.

246
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,540
We know. Now hurry.

247
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,910
Let's get you
to the U.A.C.B.R.H.Q.

248
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,180
before it's too late.

249
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,980
What's<i> that</i> stand for?

250
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:43,020
The Unicorn Coalition Alliance
Brigade Rebel Headquarters.

251
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:46,120
Oh, my gosh! It's so cute! Hurl.

252
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,460
Listen up, kids.

253
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,390
There's, like,
some for-real important stuff

254
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,930
you need to know.

255
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:53,860
Gretel has prepared
a visual presentation for us.

256
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,200
Pbht!

257
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,700
Donny, do you remember

258
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,400
the mirror you found earlier?

259
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,200
Yeah! I mean, kind of.

260
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,570
No.

261
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:03,900
That mirror is the infamous

262
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:07,170
Darkhorse Dark Magic Mirror
of Darkness,

263
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:10,380
into which the Four Unicorns
of the Apocalypse

264
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,350
were banished many years ago.

265
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:16,080
When Donny looked into it
and made one of his funny faces,

266
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:18,720
it broke the spell
and unleashed them

267
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,990
into the unicorn world
to spread their evil.

268
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:24,460
And now their leader, Stanicorn,

269
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:28,800
is harvesting the magic from all
the unicorns in Unicorn Land.

270
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,060
That's awful!

271
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:32,600
Once he absorbs
enough unicorn magic,

272
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,740
he will be powerful enough
to leave the unicorn world

273
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,840
and enslave other worlds, too...

274
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,340
Including yours, girls.

275
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:43,110
Man, Donny, you done goofed.

276
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,450
The only way to banish them

277
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:46,710
is by getting them
back into that mirror.

278
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,120
But it's deep in the fortress
being guarded 24/8.

279
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,350
"24/8"?

280
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:53,950
Yes.
Unicorn weeks have eight days.

281
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,390
Today's a Spursday,

282
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:58,390
so it's obviously the best day
to infiltrate their defense.

283
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:01,860
Donny, you must find the mirror
and make the same funny face

284
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:04,930
to send the four unicorns
back from whence they came.

285
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:07,540
Aw, why's it got to be me?

286
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:10,040
Because, Donny, you are...

287
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,340
the Chosen One!

288
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,240
What does that even mean?

289
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,380
I don't know! But it
sounds really cool!

290
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,250
I wish
I had more time to explain,

291
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:22,120
but we need to get you
in that fortress now.

292
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,780
You'll need disguises.

293
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:27,150
We're unicorns!

294
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,260
This is my nightmare.

295
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,760
And for you, Donny...

296
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,300
A beard? Hey-o-o-o!

297
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,500
Don't worry, dudes.

298
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,300
I'll be with you the whole time.

299
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,830
Now follow me! Unh!

300
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:43,900
Gretel, how many times
do I have to tell you

301
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:46,510
not to leave your jellybean
collection on the floor?

302
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,810
Bluhah-ruh!

303
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:50,180
Well, looks like
you're on your own, girls.

304
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,380
My magic can only get you
to the outside of the castle.

305
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,480
You'll have to find
your own way in.

306
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,480
Wait. What?

307
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:02,420
There's the fortress.

308
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:06,430
We just need
to get past the guards.

309
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,430
Get down!

Uh... yeah!

323
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,360
It's over there!

324
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,160
Hmm, actually, buddy,
I'm pretty sure it's over there.

325
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,900
Um, excuse me, I've been working
at this fortress for 50 years,

326
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:46,670
and I always go to the bathroom
right over there!

327
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:49,870
Well, I've been working here
for<i> 51</i> years,

328
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:52,910
and I always
do my bathrooms over there!

329
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,170
Guys!

330
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,410
This place has only
been around for a few days!

331
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:57,880
Hey, she's right!

332
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,550
You don't work here at all!

333
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,550
Then neither do you!

334
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,590
Imposter! Imposter!

335
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,660
Oh, hey, guys!

336
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,560
Are we sure "the Chosen One"
doesn't mean "biggest screw-up"?

337
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,060
I'm sorry, guys.

338
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,330
I was just really getting into
my beardy character.

339
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,030
Ah-ta-ta-ta-ta!

340
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,200
Silence!

341
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,740
Allow us
to formally introduce ourselves.

342
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:27,980
We are the Four Unicorns
of the Apocalypse!

343
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:30,910
I am Joeicorn,
and my sword-wielding skills

344
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:33,210
have conquered
countless civilizations

345
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,420
throughout history.

346
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:38,050
I'm Petercorn,
and my thrashing guitar skills

347
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:40,290
have demolished entire planets!

348
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,560
Oww!

349
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:45,230
I'm Tanyacorn,
and I'm the girl one!

350
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,460
I am...

351
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,960
A short balding dude?

352
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,800
Aah! Hey!

353
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,440
Get a sense of humor, will you?

354
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,770
Humor?

355
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:57,940
I've never laughed at anything,

356
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,340
not once in my entire life!

357
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,780
Hmm!

358
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,810
Wow.

359
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:04,510
You must be
a real blast at parties.

360
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:06,980
I'm going to especially enjoy

361
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:10,780
taking my time to destroy
you four jerks

362
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:15,860
