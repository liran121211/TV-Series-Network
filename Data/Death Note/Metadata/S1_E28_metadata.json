With the exchange set to take place in Los Angeles, Near lends his support while secretly planning to take the Death Note and bring down Kira; however, Mello (Sayu's kidnapper) resets the time and place of the exchange to get the notebook.

Soichiro takes the Death Note to the exchange point chosen by the kidnappers in Los Angeles, but Mello's men hijack the plane he is on and drop him off in the middle of the desert.
