all the trouble of making this?

How could you be so generous, to share
something so precious and expensive?

I heard Duk Seon is
learning Baduk as of late?

100
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,860
I did hear that Baduk is good for
increasing one's concentration.

101
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,860
Baduk must be difficult for her.

102
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,360
She probably won't last too long.

103
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,550
Hey, how can you say that?

104
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,110
What do you mean,
she won't last long?

105
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,860
I bet she already gave up on it
without lasting a full day!

106
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,350
I know I shouldn't talk about
my own daughter like this...

107
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:24,350
but she really has no talent
for studying.

108
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:28,350
But, you know, I heard
something else too.

109
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:32,350
I heard that Baduk really is that good
for increasing one's concentration.

What are you doing?
Why aren't you eating?

111

Shut it.
Don't eat.

348
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:00,770
Just do it, already!

349
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:02,270
Do it for your sister's sake,
at least!

350
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:04,270
I said no!

351
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:08,270
They're letting you join even though
Jung Hwan is the one getting tutored.

352
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:09,270
For free.

353
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:10,270
Shut it.

354
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:12,770
You really didn't catch onto that?

355
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:15,270
It's as if Jung Bong's mother
is giving you allowance!

356
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:17,270
You think that Jung Hwan
really needs tutoring?

357
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:19,270
You're the only one on the block
that needs any tutoring!

358
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:20,770
There's Dong Ryong, too.

359
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:24,210
Dong Ryong's father is a teacher!
So why would he need tutoring?

360
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:28,270
Either way, we decided to do it starting
today, so don't say a word. Just study.

361
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:31,270
Don't think of her as your older sister.
Think of her as your teacher!

362
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:33,270
I'm not doing it.
I'm really not doing it.

363
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:36,770
And why the hell not?

364
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:38,270
They said that Jung Hwan and Sun Woo

365
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:41,270
ranked Number one and two respectively,
are coming.

366
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:44,270
Why are you being so stubborn?

367
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:47,270
Huh? Stop being stupidly stubborn!
Just do it!

368
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:49,270
Just do as your mother tells you--

369
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:53,270
<i>Sun Woo is coming!</i>

370
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:58,270
Older Bro.

371
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:25,770
Ugh, so cold!

372
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:39,770
Would you like some juice?

373
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:41,270
Enjoy it yourself.

374
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:49,770
Hurry up and get dressed too.

375
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:51,770
The kids will come to get tutored soon.

376
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:54,270
I don't want to make them
feel awkward, so let's leave.

377
00:36:58,270 --> 00:36:59,770
I said, let's leave!

378
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:02,770
Go out by yourself.

379
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:04,770
I'm just going to stay here.

380
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:20,270
Jung Bong's father loves to stick
by your side... so where is he today?

381
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:22,770
I don't know!
What's he grumpy about this time?

382
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:25,270
Geez... it's like raising another kid.

383
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:27,270
Oh, come here!
Have a beer.

384
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:29,770
Oh geez... what's this,
drinking in broad daylight?

385
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:31,270
I'm afraid of what others will think.

386
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:33,770
We're all friends here on this block,
so whatever.

387
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:35,770
But... what about Bo Ra's father?

388
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:38,770
Why didn't you two come out together?
He could've had a drink with us.

389
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:41,770
I don't know. He left in the morning
saying he was meeting friends.

390
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:47,270
I wish he'd take No Eul to the public
baths or help around the house today.

391
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:48,770
He's so selfish.

392
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:51,770
He doesn't even bother you... how nice.

393
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,020
Geez, lady.

394
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,770
You're so lucky to be able to
say something like that.

395
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:56,870
If Bo Ra's father was even half
the man that Jung Bong's father was

396
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:58,270
I'd carry him on my back every day.

397
00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:00,270
I'd treat him like a king.

398
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:02,770
It's only nice for a day or two...
trust me.

399
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:06,270
I wish he'd see his friends
or go off somewhere on the weekends.

400
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:10,270
All he does is
roll around the house... geez!

401
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:13,270
Wow... you two have no etiquette.

402
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:16,270
Are you poking fun at me
for being a widow?

403
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:19,270
Are you bragging about
your husbands in front of me?

404
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:20,270
Geez.

405
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:22,270
Your life is the best, honestly.

406
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:24,270
Geez... it must be nice to be you.

407
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:25,770
Really.

408
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:29,020
Then... get together with Taek's dad.

409
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:31,270
It's pretty much fate that
you live on the same block.

410
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:33,700
What did you say?
Are you out of your mind?

411
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,270
Why? What's wrong with it?

412
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:38,270
Oh, my.

413
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:40,770
It's like fate... it's Taek's father.

414
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:50,270
Well... then again, living with him
would be like living with a rock.

415
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:52,770
But he has a lot of money...

416
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:55,770
Looks like our Sun Young's life
will blossom in her older years!

417
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:57,770
What good would that be?

418
00:38:57,770 --> 00:39:00,270
I barely hear him say
two words in a single day.

419
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:02,770
I have to practice abstinence
forever, at this age?

420
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:06,770
I'm fine with someone with no money, but
I'm not fine with someone who's no fun.

421
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:08,270
What about my husband, then?

422
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:11,270
No thanks.
You can keep him.

423
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:14,770
Oh! I was going to come back for that!

424
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:16,770
Well, you live right here, so...

425
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:18,270
How's Taek?

426
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:20,770
Well.. you know.

427
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:23,270
Just act as if nothing happened.
That's the best thing to do.

428
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:24,270
Yes.

429
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:27,770
It's not like he can win all the time.
He has to lose sometimes.

430
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:29,770
We won't say a word to him.

431
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:33,270
But... I know it's Sunday,
but the block is especially quiet.

432
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:34,270
What about the kids?

433
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:37,270
Oh... the kids are getting
tutored by Bo Ra today.

434
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:38,270
What?

435
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:40,770
They're going to be juniors soon.

436
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:43,270
That's why they're
getting tutored by Bo Ra.

437
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:46,270
Our friend over here
treated all our kids!

438
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:48,470
Isn't tutoring... illegal?

439
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:50,270
It's among us,
so what does that matter?

440
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:52,270
Who would report us?

441
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:54,770
Are you going to report us?

442
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,270
Of course not.

443
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:00,770
- Here, have one!
- Look, he's going off to report us.

444
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:12,770
You're here too?

445
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:14,770
Yes.

446
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:17,770
Your father is a teacher, though.

447
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:19,770
Yes.

448
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:22,270
What if he reports us
to the Board of Education?

449
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:23,770
Did you tell your dad about us?

450
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:26,270
My dad's busy.

451
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:27,770
My mom registered me for this.

452
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:30,270
Why is your dad busy?
It's Sunday.

453
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:34,270
My dad...

454
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:35,770
tutors.

455
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:50,770
You all think that
I'm a science teacher, right?

456
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:52,770
That's a load of bull!

457
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:58,180
I'm... not a science teacher,
but what?

458
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:00,270
- A music teacher!
- A music teacher!

459
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:01,770
Okay, bingo!

460
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:04,770
All right... shall I have a listen, then?

461
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:07,770
We're starting the periodic table.
Ready?

462
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:11,270
One! Two!
One, two, three, four!

463
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:23,270
<i>H, He, Li, Be, B, C, N, O, F, Ne, Na, Mg
Al, Si, P, S, Cl, Ar, K, Ca!</i>

464
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:24,270
One more time!

465
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:30,270
<i>H, He, Li, Be, B, C, N,
O, F, Ne, Na, Mg...</i>

466
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:36,770
The dean... no, your father... he's a
chemistry teacher. He teaches math too?

467
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:40,770
His major in college
was mathematics.

468
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:42,270
What a plot twist,
am I right?

469
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:44,270
Wow.

470
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:47,270
All right.
Quadratic formula.

471
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:50,270
One! Two!
One, two, three, four!

472
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:59,770
<i>x equals negative b
plus or minus the square root</i>

473
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:04,770
<i>of b squared minus 4ac
all over 2a. All done!</i>

474
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:07,200
You punks.

475
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:10,270
Did you bring your math textbooks?

476
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:30,770
What is this?

477
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:33,270
She only looked at the section on sets.

478
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:35,270
I do sets better than
anyone in my class!

479
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:37,270
Geez... good for you.

480
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,770
What's with your book?

481
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:47,270
It's so wrinkly!

482
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:49,270
Don't touch that.
That's his drool.

483
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:07,270
Let's just give up on math.

484
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:11,770
Physics.
Let's test you two on physics.

485
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:14,270
A really easy question, too.

486
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:15,770
A middle school problem.

487
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:18,770
You know the formula,
F equals ma, right?

488
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,270
Jung Hwan, who is 70 kilograms

489
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:28,770
hits Sun Woo with a force
of 20 Newtons.

490
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:30,770
What's the acceleration?

491
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:35,770
How did you endure that?

492
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:37,770
It must have hurt.

493
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:42,270
You endured it well.

494
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:44,770
If you didn't get hurt,
that's good enough.

495
00:43:57,770 --> 00:43:59,270
Juice.

496
00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:02,270
Enjoy.

497
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:07,270
Thanks, Jung Bong.

498
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:11,770
You're welcome.
My pleasure.

499
00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:19,270
Older Bro.
Where are you going?

500
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:20,270
Huh?

501
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:24,270
Oh, I want to ask Taek how to solve this.

502
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:26,270
Taek's not home.
He went to the club.

503
00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:28,270
Even we barely get
to see him these days.

504
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:31,270
What?

505
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:34,270
<i>[Korean Baduk Club]</i>

506
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:55,270
What brings you here on a Sunday, Sir?

507
00:44:55,770 --> 00:44:59,270
Same goes to Taek, 6-dan.
It's Sunday, so you should relax.

508
00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:01,770
For him, this level of play
is relaxing.

509
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:06,770
How can you win every time?

510
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:08,770
Losses happen.

511
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:12,270
They say that losses are all
a part of gaining experience.

512
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:17,730
Just consider this a good experience
and forget about it already.

513
00:45:19,770 --> 00:45:24,870
Even so, Choi Taek, 6-dan's still the
likely winner of this competition.

514
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:28,770
It's fine!
It's fine!

515
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:30,270
Don't worry about it.

516
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:34,270
Other people lose 20 or 30 times a year.

517
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:38,270
The fact that you have a
70-percent winning rate...

518
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:41,270
even that's impressive enough!

519
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:43,270
Hey!

520
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:46,270
What brings you here?
You never come out on Sundays.

521
00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:48,770
I came to console our Taek.

522
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:52,770
You're okay, right?

523
00:45:54,270 --> 00:45:55,270
Of course.

524
00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:58,270
Even if you're the Almighty Choi Taek,
you can't win all the time.

525
00:45:58,270 --> 00:46:00,270
And you still have the the finals.

526
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:02,270
It's fine.
It's fine.

527
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:13,270
I'm worried about Taek.

528
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,770
Yeah.

529
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:17,270
I'm more worried about your lives!

530
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:19,770
I thought you at least knew some English.

531
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:21,270
Geez!

532
00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:23,770
You guys.

533
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:26,270
English is just memorization.
Just memorize it!

534
00:46:26,270 --> 00:46:29,270
Just forget everything else
and memorize it! Okay?

535
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:32,270
Do you even know any words?

536
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:34,770
Do you know anything that will
supplement your memorization?

537
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:37,270
Of course I do!
What do you take me for?

538
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:38,270
What, then?

539
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:40,770
I, my, me, my.

540
00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:43,770
You, your, you, yours.

541
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:46,270
- That's first-year middle school stuff.
- He, his, him, his.

542
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:47,770
Jesus.

543
00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:49,270
She... her, her, hers!

544
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:51,270
We, our, us, ours.

545
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:54,770
I know how to speak German, too.

546
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:56,770
Der, des, dem, dem,
die, der, der, die

547
00:46:56,770 --> 00:46:59,270
das, des, dem, das,
die, der, dem, die.

548
00:47:00,270 --> 00:47:03,270
Hey, I know Spanish.
Spanish.

549
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:04,770
Jeez.

550
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:08,270
<i>When I walk down the street</i>

551
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:16,270
<i>the bright sunlight flows down
and beckons me.</i>

552
00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:18,270
<i>Chiquilla mia somos</i>

553
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:21,270
<i>como el temporal
que arrastra todo y no</i>

554
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:24,770
<i>le importa donde va
nuestro carino es un</i>

555
00:47:24,770 --> 00:47:30,270
<i>barco en alta mar navega libre
sin temor a naufragar.</i>

556
00:47:30,270 --> 00:47:35,770
<i>Carino mio, somos dos
y tu y yo pajaro y la flor</i>

557
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:42,270
<i>y tu y yo lanzamos el amor
y tu y yo directo al corazon</i>

558
00:47:42,270 --> 00:47:44,270
<i>al corazon eres carino mio.</i>

559
00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:46,770
<i>My lovable dearest,
I want to keep you by my side forever</i>

560
00:47:46,770 --> 00:47:55,270
<i>the one I want to kiss,
who has shaken my heart</i>

561
00:47:55,270 --> 00:47:58,270
<i>my eternal love!</i>

562
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:07,270
You didn't forget that you're coming to
Duk Seon's school with me tomorrow, yes?

563
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:10,270
Hey, I don't know when
I'm getting out of work.

564
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:12,270
You go by yourself.

565
00:48:12,270 --> 00:48:13,770
They asked both of us to come!

566
00:48:13,770 --> 00:48:16,770
It's the first meeting about her future.
How can I go alone?

567
00:48:16,770 --> 00:48:19,270
All right, already!
Give it a rest!

568
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:20,270
I'll come.

569
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:22,270
Thank you!

570
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:26,770
Don't go talking to strangers
on your way home.

571
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:28,770
Call home as soon as you leave the bank.

572
00:48:28,770 --> 00:48:30,270
Why do you never call?

573
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:33,270
Look at Jung Bong's dad. He calls
every hour after he leaves his shop.

574
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:34,270
Other husbands--

575
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:36,770
All right, already!
Give it a rest!

576
00:48:36,770 --> 00:48:38,770
I'm not your child.

577
00:48:38,770 --> 00:48:42,770
Every time I try to say something,
you're just dying to nag at me!

578
00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:45,270
Really, I...
oh my.

579
00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:49,770
Oh, T...

580
00:48:50,270 --> 00:48:52,270
He probably feels terrible.

581
00:48:52,270 --> 00:48:55,170
Don't say anything to aggravate him.
Be really careful.

582
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:57,270
Why, I ought to...

583
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:00,770
Master Choi!
Hi, there.

584
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:05,770
Oh, yes.

585
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:09,270
Um... here. Have one of these.

586
00:49:09,770 --> 00:49:14,770
Also, why don't you and your father
come eat dinner at our place tonight?

587
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:17,770
I'm going to make seaweed soup today.

588
00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:19,270
You like seaweed soup, right?

589
00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:21,270
It's okay.

590
00:49:21,770 --> 00:49:24,770
Um... then...

591
00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:25,770
Okay.

592
00:49:26,270 --> 00:49:28,770
Okay. Bye.

593
00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:29,770
Bye, now!

594
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:31,770
Bye!

595
00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:33,270
How sad...

596
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:35,270
Why, I ought to...

597
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:38,270
Did you feed your common sense
to Haeng Gook?

598
00:49:38,270 --> 00:49:41,270
How could you offer seaweed soup
to someone who lost a match?

599
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:44,270
Oh my God! It's an allegory for failure.
You're right.

600
00:49:44,270 --> 00:49:46,770
Oh my God, what do I do?
I totally forgot.

601
00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:48,770
Geez... what do I do?

602
00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:50,770
Go and tell him that
you're sorry, already!

603
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:54,270
Geez...

604
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:04,770
You're just getting home?

605
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:09,270
What about dinner?

606
00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:11,270
I ate.

607
00:50:12,270 --> 00:50:13,270
Taek.

608
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:17,270
Have strength. Okay?

609
00:50:18,270 --> 00:50:19,270
Yes.

610
00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:34,270
What about your dad?

611
00:50:34,270 --> 00:50:35,770
He says he doesn't want any.

612
00:50:40,770 --> 00:50:41,770
Wait.

613
00:50:48,770 --> 00:50:50,270
Dinner, honey.

614
00:50:52,770 --> 00:50:54,270
Your food is going to get cold.

615
00:51:02,770 --> 00:51:04,730
I wonder what he's
grumpy about this time.

616
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:05,770
Geez.

617
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:10,410
Where are you going?
You're not eating dinner?

618
00:51:10,410 --> 00:51:12,770
I'm going to Taek's.
I'll eat with the guys.

619
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:14,770
Don't bother Taek
and come home early!

620
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:15,770
Okay!

621
00:51:20,270 --> 00:51:21,270
Eat up already.

622
00:51:22,270 --> 00:51:27,270
<i>My mom really likes this!
And this, too!</i>

623
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:29,270
<i>You're a filial son, Chil Deuk.</i>

624
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:31,770
<i>But don't just play.
Do some hard work, too.</i>

625
00:51:31,770 --> 00:51:33,270
<i>- Okay?
- Okay.</i>

626
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:35,270
<i>Earn some money fishing.</i>

627
00:51:35,270 --> 00:51:39,610
<i>- Your mother is worried because of you.
- What do you know about my mom...</i>

628
00:51:39,610 --> 00:51:41,270
Hey. Eat.

629
00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:42,270
Okay.

630
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:46,770
Hey, that's Kim Hye Soo,
right?

631
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:52,270
Wow... she's so pretty.

632
00:51:52,270 --> 00:51:55,770
What is she, 22, 23?

633
00:51:55,770 --> 00:51:56,770
She's 19!

634
00:51:56,770 --> 00:51:59,270
She's 19! She's younger than Bo Ra!

635
00:51:59,270 --> 00:52:01,270
Oh my... she's 19?

636
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:05,770
What kind of 19-year-old
is so good at acting?

637
00:52:05,770 --> 00:52:09,270
Look at her face.
She's a pretty one.

638
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:16,270
Geez... who doesn't look that good at 19?

639
00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:19,270
I was pretty like that when I was 19.

640
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:22,270
What utter nonsense.

641
00:52:22,270 --> 00:52:26,270
When I met you, you were 18.

642
00:52:26,270 --> 00:52:29,270
There wasn't a single part of you
that was pretty.

643
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:32,270
Then did I date Il Hwa or Yi Hwa?
(wordplay of "one" and "two")

644
00:52:32,270 --> 00:52:34,270
Please!
Do you know how you were back then?

645
00:52:34,270 --> 00:52:37,270
You had such terrible dry skin...

646
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:39,770
you're lucky that you met me.

647
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:46,270
Geez, you... how could you talk
to your almighty husband like that?

648
00:52:46,270 --> 00:52:49,770
It's so obvious that you're uneducated.

649
00:52:49,770 --> 00:52:51,770
Almighty, my ass.

650
00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:53,770
Don't joke with me.

651
00:52:56,270 --> 00:52:57,770
Don't joke with me?

652
00:52:57,770 --> 00:53:00,770
Look at the way you talk!

653
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:01,770
I...

654
00:53:04,270 --> 00:53:06,770
And just where the hell
are you going?

655
00:53:06,770 --> 00:53:07,770
To Taek's.

656
00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:09,270
- Don't go!
- Don't go!

657
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:12,270
Taek is still sad about his loss.

658
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:14,770
Don't hang around there.
Stay the hell at home!

659
00:53:14,770 --> 00:53:17,270
It's too late to be visiting people.
Leave Taek alone.

660
00:53:20,770 --> 00:53:22,270
Mom, I'm off!

661
00:53:22,270 --> 00:53:23,770
It's dinnertime!
Where are you going?

662
00:53:23,770 --> 00:53:26,270
To Taek's!
I'll eat with the others!

663
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:28,270
Sun Woo!

664
00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:30,270
Don't say anything to Taek!

665
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:34,950
You'll make him feel worse...
Geez.

666
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:36,770
<i>Taek.</i>

667
00:53:37,770 --> 00:53:38,770
Taek...

668
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:40,270
<i>I'm washing up.</i>

669
00:53:40,270 --> 00:53:41,770
Okay.

670
00:54:11,570 --> 00:54:13,270
Mister, is Taek home?

671
00:54:13,270 --> 00:54:15,770
Yeah, he is.
But his condition isn't...

672
00:54:15,770 --> 00:54:17,770
Taek!
The Almighty Me is here!

673
00:54:20,770 --> 00:54:22,770
- Mister!
- Hello!

674
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:24,270
Is Taek home?

675
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:25,770
Yeah. But he's...

676
00:54:25,770 --> 00:54:28,770
<i>- No need to explain...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!</i>

677
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:31,770
<i>If you try it yourself...
ah, ah, ah!</i>

678
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:34,270
<i>I don't know, I don't know,
I don't know! Do you know?</i>

679
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:37,270
<i>- I don't know.
- I don't know, either.</i>

680
00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:40,770
Hello. Is Taek...

681
00:54:40,770 --> 00:54:43,270
Yeah, he's here. Yeah.
He's been here for a while now.

682
00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:44,270
Yes.

683
00:54:44,270 --> 00:54:47,270
Taek!

684
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:13,270
Geez...

685
00:55:13,270 --> 00:55:15,270
I heard you got beat badly.

686
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:17,270
Way to go, bastard.

687
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:18,770
You've humiliated our town.

688
00:55:19,770 --> 00:55:21,270
Hi, Taek!

689
00:55:21,770 --> 00:55:23,270
I heard you lost.

690
00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:24,270
Geez.

691
00:55:26,770 --> 00:55:28,270
I heard they stepped all over you.

692
00:55:28,270 --> 00:55:30,770

869
01:10:53,830 --> 01:10:54,830
Yes, Sir!

870
01:10:54,830 --> 01:10:56,330
Hey, Jung Hwan.
You clean up, okay?

871
01:10:56,330 --> 01:10:57,330
Okay.

872
01:11:03,830 --> 01:11:05,330
Hey... hey!

873
01:11:05,330 --> 01:11:07,330
Hey, hey, hey... cramp!
Cramp, cramp, cramp!

874
01:11:07,330 --> 01:11:08,830
Are you okay?

875
01:11:09,830 --> 01:11:10,830
Ow...

876
01:11:10,830 --> 01:11:12,830
Are you okay?
What do we do?

877
01:11:12,830 --> 01:11:14,330
I got a cramp in my leg!

878
01:11:14,330 --> 01:11:15,830
Okay, already!

879
01:11:15,830 --> 01:11:18,330
Ow... ow!
Don't touch. Ow.

880
01:11:18,330 --> 01:11:19,830
Ow!

881
01:11:19,830 --> 01:11:22,330
Do something about it!

882
01:11:23,830 --> 01:11:24,830
Meow!

883
01:11:27,890 --> 01:11:29,830
Meow!

884
01:11:30,330 --> 01:11:32,830
What the hell are you doing?

885
01:11:33,830 --> 01:11:35,830
No?

886
01:11:37,330 --> 01:11:38,330
Meow!

887
01:11:39,830 --> 01:11:40,830
Hey... stop that.

888
01:11:40,830 --> 01:11:41,830
Fine.

889
01:11:42,330 --> 01:11:43,830
Don't touch it!

890
01:11:43,830 --> 01:11:45,330
What do you want me to do, then?

891
01:11:45,330 --> 01:11:46,830
Okay, then... meow!

892
01:11:46,830 --> 01:11:47,830
I said stop!
Ow!

893
01:11:48,330 --> 01:11:49,830
- Meow!
- Stop it!

894
01:11:49,830 --> 01:11:51,830
- Ow...
- Here, let me see!

895
01:11:51,830 --> 01:11:53,830
Let go! Ow!

896
01:11:53,830 --> 01:11:55,830
It really hurts!

897
01:11:55,830 --> 01:11:57,330
- Meow, meow, meow!
- Stop it!

898
01:11:57,330 --> 01:11:58,830
Meow!

899
01:11:58,830 --> 01:12:01,830
Let me see, already!

900
01:12:01,830 --> 01:12:04,330
Ow, ow, ow!

901
01:12:04,330 --> 01:12:05,330
Roar!

902
01:12:05,330 --> 01:12:07,330
You think roaring is going to work?

903
01:12:07,330 --> 01:12:08,330
Roar!

904
01:12:11,330 --> 01:12:12,830
I'm off!

905
01:12:16,330 --> 01:12:17,830
Oh yeah, my lunch.

906
01:12:22,330 --> 01:12:23,330
Damn it!

907
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:47,330
- What are you going?
- Huh?

908
01:12:47,330 --> 01:12:48,950
Are you waiting for me?

909
01:12:48,950 --> 01:12:51,330
No!
I'm waiting for Sun Woo!

910
01:12:51,830 --> 01:12:52,830
Oh.

911
01:12:52,830 --> 01:12:53,830
Sun Woo?

912
01:13:18,830 --> 01:13:20,330
Miss, what about Sun Woo?

913
01:13:20,330 --> 01:13:22,330
Sun Woo?

914
01:13:22,330 --> 01:13:24,330
He already left!

915
01:13:25,830 --> 01:13:26,830
Damn it!

916
01:13:59,830 --> 01:14:01,830
Hey, Mister!

917
01:14:01,830 --> 01:14:02,830
Geez!

918
01:15:11,830 --> 01:15:12,830
Geez!

919
01:15:28,830 --> 01:15:30,830
<i>I'm going to be gone for two days or so.</i>

920
01:15:30,830 --> 01:15:33,830
<i>If you want to live,
listen carefully to what I have to say.</i>

921
01:15:35,330 --> 01:15:37,330
<i>Don't you worry.</i>

922
01:15:37,330 --> 01:15:38,330
<i>All right?</i>

923
01:15:41,330 --> 01:15:42,330
<i>Yay!</i>

924
01:15:42,330 --> 01:15:44,330
<i>We did it up yesterday, right?</i>

925
01:15:44,330 --> 01:15:46,830
<i>I'll borrow this and give it right back!</i>

926
01:15:46,830 --> 01:15:48,830
<i>This, too!</i>

927
01:15:48,830 --> 01:15:51,120
<i>They said that they've
arrived at the terminal.</i>

928
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:52,330
<i>Terminal?</i>

929
01:15:52,330 --> 01:15:53,830
<i>This is an emergency!</i>

930
01:15:53,830 --> 01:15:56,830
<i>Change your clothes and
clean everything!</i>

931
01:16:01,330 --> 01:16:03,330
<i>You're dead today!</i>

932
01:16:03,330 --> 01:16:04,830
<i>- Let go!
- Get over here!</i>

933
01:16:05,330 --> 01:16:06,830
<i>Are you trying to ruin your life?</i>

934
01:16:06,830 --> 01:16:09,830
<i>Do I have to foam at the mouth and
pass out for you to come to your senses?</i>

935
01:16:09,830 --> 01:16:11,830
<i>What if Big Sis gets a criminal record?</i>

936
01:16:11,830 --> 01:16:15,330
<i>Bo Ra is the issue!
She's so scary!</i>

937
01:16:15,330 --> 01:16:16,330
<i>Hey!</i>

938
01:16:17,330 --> 01:16:18,830
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!</i>

939
01:16:18,830 --> 01:16:20,330
<i>Aren't you worried about your child?</i>

940
01:16:20,830 --> 01:16:22,830
<i>Sun Woo.
Have you seen my Bo Ra?</i>

941
01:16:22,830 --> 01:16:25,830
<i>Stop coming here, already!</i>

942
01:16:25,830 --> 01:16:27,330
<i>Bo Ra!</i>
