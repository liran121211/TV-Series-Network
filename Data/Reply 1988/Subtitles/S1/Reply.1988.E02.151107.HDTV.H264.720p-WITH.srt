Granny. Do you know what

00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:04,350
Don't you dare.

59

It's "IWESS."

60
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:08,050
It stands for
"Idiots Who Especially Suck at Studying."

61
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:10,550
As if you're good at studying...
all you do is go to protests!

62
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,640
Did you just call me "you?"

Then, good night.

Granny.

74
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:46,850
What?

75
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:49,350
What was Uncle like?
Did he study better than Dad?

76
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:52,850
No. Your father was a whole lot smarter
than him when it came to school.

77
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:57,850
And he graduated from
that prestigious school in Gwangju.

78
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,850
Your uncle...

79
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:08,850
took it upon himself since he was young
to earn money for his younger siblings.

80
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,350
But even so, Uncle is the
richest among us.

81
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,350
He even lives in the U.S.

82
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:17,850
You think that running a laundromat
in the States is prestigious?

83
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:22,350
He's barely managing
to put food on the table nowadays.

84
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:26,850
Geez. When I think about your uncle...

85
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:33,350
my heart just hurts.

86
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,350
Then, who's a better son to you?

87
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:39,350
Dad calls you every morning.

88
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:42,350
Why are you asking that?

89
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,850
Both of them are good sons.

90
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:52,350
Your dad and your uncle never fought.

91
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:55,850
Why can't you two be like that? Geez.

92
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:59,850
That's because Bo Ra
always picks fights with me first.

spend another night here.

She left early to go to the library.

108
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:13,350

She probably went to protest.

It looks fine!

114

00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,850
They're not Korean noodles...

177
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:08,350
It's called spaghetti.

178
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:09,850
You've never had it, right?

179
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,850
It's the first time I've seen it.

180
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:14,350
You should have just made
normal noodles.

181
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,350
I have money, so might as well spend it.

182
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,350
I'm going to eat what
rich people eat before I die.

183
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,850
What are you doing?

184
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,350
Are you boiling Korean noodles?

185
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,850
Are these chewy noodles?

186
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,350
I said it's spaghetti!

187
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,350
Okay.

188
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:29,350
Stop glaring like that.
You look so scary.

189
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:34,350
At any rate, why are we celebrating
Taek's victory at our place?

190
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,950
It's just the two of them,
so it's not like they'll cook anything.

191
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,250
I told them to just buy chicken.

192
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,850
- Taek is coming, too.
- Oh, really?

193
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:42,850
I guess I'll see Mr. Choi
for the first time in a while, huh?

194
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:46,350
Wouldn't it be great if I had a daughter
and got him as a son-in-law?

195
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,850
I claimed Taek first.

196
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,350
He's going to be my son-in-law.

197
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:53,350
But, Bo Ra isn't coming today?
Everyone else is.

198
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:57,350
She does something at school
every Saturday and comes home late.

199
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,350
She won't be home after
12:00 a.m. today, either.

200
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:02,350
Mom! Where are you?

201
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:04,350
Bo Ra?

202
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:07,850
What the heck?
Why is she back so early?

203
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,350
Mom!

204
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:17,850
Eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve,
thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen...

205
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:19,350
How old am I, again?

206
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,850
Eighteen.

207
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:22,350
Click it two more times.

208
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,850
Seventeen, eighteen.

209
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,850
If it breaks, your love is doomed.

210
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,350
If it breaks, your love won't come true.

211
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:37,850
Hey. Don't you even dream
of love until you get those braces off.

212
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:40,850
Shush.

213
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:43,350
My first love depends on this.

214
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:46,350
I'm going to a club trip today.

215
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,350
I'm going to go as soon as I pack my bag.

216
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,850
What's this about a club trip,
all of the sudden?

217
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,350
I don't know.

218
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:02,850
An upperclassman said he got
paid today, so he wants to go Daesungri.

219
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:05,350
Crazy bastard!
He just does whatever he wants!

220
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,350
Mom.

221
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:13,350
Did you see my tan pants
that were here?

222
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,850
I washed those this morning
and hung them up.

223
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:18,750
They should be dry by now.
Let me go get them.

224
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,350
No, it's okay.
I'll just wear these pants.

225
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:26,350
But Mom...

226
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:28,350
I don't see that.

227
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,850
You know... my jacket.

228
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,850
Where's my jacket?

229
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,850
The baseball jacket.

230
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,850
I left that at the dry cleaner's...

231
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:43,850
No, no. My denim jacket.

232
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:47,850
Huh?

233
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,350
Where's my denim jacket?

234
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:51,850
It was definitely here.

235
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:53,350
I even saw it this morning!

236
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,350
Where's my denim jacket?

237
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,350
Huh?

238
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:00,350
Um... that is...

239
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,850
um... Bo Ra.

240
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:03,350
It was definitely here
this morning!

241
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:06,350
Why isn't it here now?

242
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,350
Where's my denim jacket?

243
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:12,850
Damn it! Hmm... did I wash it?

244
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:14,350
Wait just a minute.

245
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,850
Where's my denim jacket?

246
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,350
Damn it!

247
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:22,850
<i>Sung Duk Seon! I'll kill her!</i>

248
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,350
<i>I'm going to kill her!</i>

249
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,850
<i>Damn Sung Duk Seon!</i>

250
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:38,850
I think watching the fiasco downstairs
would be more entertaining than this.

251
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:42,350
Ma'am. Lend me your phone.
Oh, and the phone book.

252
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,350
<i>Yes, this is Ssangmundong High School.</i>

253
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,850
Sir! No, no...

254
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:58,350
Can you put a the dean
on the line?

255
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,850
Yes, this is the dean.

256
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:04,350
Dong Ryong's father!

257
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:05,850
Can you put No Eul on the line?

258
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,350
Yes, hello?

259
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:10,850
Mom?

260
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:38,850
Duk Seon!

261
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:45,350
Duk Seon! Jacket!

262
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:15,350
<i>[Dae Wang Computer Game Cafe]</i>

263
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,340
He's definitely on steroids. For sure.

264
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:06,340
<i>What the hell am I going to wear?</i>

265
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:09,340
<i>I'm going to kill Sung Duk Seon!
Damn it!</i>

266
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,340
<i>Where did Sung Duk Seon go?</i>

267
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:15,340
Geez... where do you think?
School, obviously.

268
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:18,840
Geez... sometimes, I wonder how
she even got into Seoul University.

269
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,840
She's coming. Over there.

270
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,840
Where are you going?

271
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,840
To go kill Sung Duk Seon.

272
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,840
Here it is!

273
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,340
It was right here.

274
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,340
I totally forgot.

275
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,340
I'm back from school.

276
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,840
Oh, you're home, Duk Seon?

277
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,340
You're early today.

278
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:28,340
It's Saturday so I got out earlier.

279
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,340
Hey, Sung Duk Seon.

280
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,340
What?

281
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,340
Did you wear your indoor slippers
to school today?

282
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,230
Yeah. Duh.

283
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,840
Duk Seon.

284
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,750
Go get washed up,
and let's go to Jung Hwan's.

285
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,840
We're celebrating Taek's victory today.

286
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,340
So Jung Hwan's mom bought
American noodles and everything.

287
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,840
Damn it!

288
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,340
What are you going to do about this?

289
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,340
- Should I use the hair dryer?
- I don't have time for that!

290
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,340
Why did you wash this
without even asking me?

291
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:01,340
What am I supposed to wear today?

292
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:04,340
Hey. Grow up.

293
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,840
What did you just say to me?

294
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,340
I said, grow up instead
of harassing Mom!

295
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,340
You little... hey!

296
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,340
You grow up.

297
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,340
You're always last place.

298
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:15,340
I'm not last place!
There are other people lower than me!

299
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,840
Is that something to brag about?

300
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,650
And also, what do you need clothes for
when all you do is play all day?

301
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,340
Just wear whatever!

302
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:24,040
You're ugly, so it's not like
you need to worry about looks anyway.

303
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,040
I held back a lot today.

304
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,840
You're dead today. Hey!

305
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,340
You think you're pretty?

306
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,840
You nose looks like a man's!

307
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,340
Damn it!

308
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,840
I'm back... off to school.

309
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,840
Am I your friend? Huh?

310
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,540
I'm going to kill you!
You drive me crazy!

311
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,840
"You?" I'll kill you!

312
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,840
Crazy bitch!

313
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:58,340
<i>[A moment's decision influences
the next 10 years of your life.]</i>

314
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:28,840
If I met Mr. Young Pil,
my life would be complete!

315
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:33,840
Jo Young Pil is two years younger
than you! No need call him "Mr."

316
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,340
Even so...

317
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:40,840
Hi! What are you all up to?

318
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,340
- They're still not here?
- Oh, hi, Jin Joo!

319
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:46,340
Wow, look at everyone!

320
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,840
Honey, you're home early today.

321
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,840
Geez, you...

322
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,650
Mr. Choi's dad said that he's treating us
for the first time in a while

323
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:54,750
so of course I couldn't be late
on a day like today.

324
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,840
Speaking of which,
what's on the menu for today?

325
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,340
We have spaghetti.

326
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,840
Get... getty?
What's that?

327
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,340
Spaghetti. It's American food.

328
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,840
How are we supposed to eat this, anyway?

329
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,340
How do you think?
The same way you eat anything else.

330
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,340
Why isn't Mr. Choi here yet?
The noodles are getting bloated.

331
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,840
Mr. Choi is like the Jo Young Pil
of our neighborhood.

332
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,340
The superstar always comes last.

333
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,340
Oh, the superstar is here.

334
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,340
The door is open,
so why is he using the bell?

335
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,340
Here you go.

336
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,340
Hello.

337
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,340
"Kantapia."

338
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,840
Go to Jung Bong's room.

339
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,340
Why did you get here so late?

340
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,340
We were waiting for you.

341
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:36,840
You should have closed shop
on a day like today.

342
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,450
You don't need to work so hard
when your son earns so much money.

343
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:42,340
That's not my money.
That's Taek's.

344
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,840
Where would Taek even use that money?

345
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,340
Why not use some of it?

346
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,340
Oh yes... here you go.

347
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:52,340
Wow... you bought two of them?

348
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:54,340
Honey. Put this in Jung Hwan's room.

349
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,340
Okay.

350
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,340
Is Taek coming, too?

351
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,840
It's been so long since
I've seen him.

352
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,340
He's coming.

353
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,540
He doesn't even attend school

354
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:07,340
so the only friends he has
are the kids from this block.

355
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,840
But he wants to cool his head first.

356
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,840
<i>Oh, geez.</i>

357
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,840
<i>Mr. Choi.</i>

358
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,340
<i>Say a greeting for me.</i>

359
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,340
<i>- Huh?
- What's that?</i>

360
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,340
<i>Mr. Choi!</i>

361
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,340
<i>Please grant this wish of mine!</i>

362
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,340
<i>No, it's okay.</i>

363
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,340
<i>Geez... then...</i>

364
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,840
<i>Bo Ra's dad,
please say something!</i>

365
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:36,840
<i>Then, what about the Ugly Sisters
of our town?</i>

366
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,340
<i>- A camera!
- So amazing!</i>

367
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,840
<i>It records our movements!</i>

368
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,840
<i>Geez.</i>

369
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,840
<i>Oh!</i>

370
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,340
<i>There's a missing lady here.</i>

371
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,840
<i>There was a lady who was
the prettiest among you three.</i>

372
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,840
<i>Has anyone seen my cheetah?</i>

373
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,840
<i>Here she is.</i>

374
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,540
<i>I'm giving you until the count of three.</i>

375
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,840
<i>One, two, three!</i>

376
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,340
You thought I was putting it down,
right?

377
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,340
- Geez...
- Ow!

378
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,340
Get rid of it!

379
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,840
My eye almost popped out! What
would I do if that happened?

380
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,840
- I'm back.
- Hello.

381
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,840
Hey there.

382
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,340
- Where's our Sun Woo?
- He's coming.

383
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,840
- Hello! I'm back from school!
- You're here, my son?

384
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,840
Our Sun Woo... you know that
I brag about you, right?

385
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,840
Yes.

386
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,840
I wonder why my friend
isn't coming?

387
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,840
Who?

388
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:33,340
Oh, President Sung!

389
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:36,840
Oh, President Kim!

390
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:42,340
- It's so great to see you!
- It's so great to see you!

391
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:44,340
Oh, Duk Seon!

392
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:47,340
Thanks for reciprocating.

393
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:51,340
I got it. I know.

394
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,840
What the hell are you two doing?

395
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,840
How come Taek didn't come with you?

396
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,840
He's coming.

397
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,840
The star of the show
always shows up last!

398
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,840
I told him to go borrow some comic books.

399
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,840
Wow, Duk Seon.
You've got some nerve.

400
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,340
Making the Almighty Taek
do that for you?

401
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,340
Only outsiders care about that stuff.

402
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,840
Do you think the kids
treat him any differently?

403
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,340
They're childhood friends.

404
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,840
Hello.

405
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,840
- Congratulations!
- Yay!

406
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,840
- Come on in!
- Hi!

407
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,340
Thank you for gracing us with
your presence today, sir.

408
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:33,340
This place is unfit for your presence,
and yet you've come.

409
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,840
What an honor this is.

410
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:40,340
Oh yeah, I want you all to greet him.
He's our son-in-law.

411
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:44,340
What are you saying?
He's going to marry my Jin Joo!

412
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,340
We called dibs first! Right, Taek?

413
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,840
Welcome. I'm your new mother.

414
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,340
I'm your new father.

415
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,340
Oh, stop it, already.

416
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,340
Go inside.
All the kids are here.

417
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,340
Enjoy your meal.

418
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,340
Okay.

419
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,340
Look at him.
He's all grown now.

420
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:07,340
Geez... he's totally like an adult!

421
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:11,340
Compared to our kids,
he seems so much older!

422
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,840
He's still just a kid.

423
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,340
All he knows how to do
is play Baduk.

424
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,340
He knows nothing about the world.

425
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:22,340
Geez, you... elements of the real
world are all a part of Baduk.

426
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,340
Do you think Taek doesn't know that?

427
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:27,340
And he's one of the
best Baduk players ever.

428
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:30,840
In some ways, he might know more about
the world than we adults do.

429
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:35,340
Speaking of which, how much was
the prize money this time around?

430
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,840
I heard that he won the largest
competition in all of Korea.

431
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,930
50,000,000 won.

432
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,340
Oh my goodness!

433
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:50,840
Taek should buy a huge round
for the kids today!

434
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,340
Oh my God...
50,000,000 won...

435
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,340
I'm speechless.

436
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,840
- That's so much money.
- You must be so happy. I'm so jealous.

437
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,250
- 50,000,000 won?
- 50,000,000 won?

438
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,340
Buy us ddukbokki.

439
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:14,340
- Ddukbokki!
- Ddukbokki!

440
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,840
- Hey, have some chicken.
- That's okay.

441
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:21,840
Look at how pale your face is. Don't
forget to work out once in a while.

442
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:25,340
Is this your stomach or your back?
You're so thin.

443
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,340
I'm fine.

444
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,250
Hey, Taek. You're going to China again,
right?

445
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,950
When are you coming back?
Are you coming back before your birthday?

446
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,000
Why?

447
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,750
- You want to throw him a birthday party?
- No. Bring us some liquor.

448
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:37,840
- Mom!
- What's wrong with you?

449
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,040
Why are you telling Taek to do that?
Buy it yourselves!

450
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,840
He's on a different level.

451
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,340
They always give him expensive
bottles of liquor in China.

452
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,340
Hey, Choi Taek.

453
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:48,340
Don't give it to your dad this time.
Give it to us. Okay?

454
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,840
- Hey.
- Where are you going?

455
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,210
- To get some juice.
- Don't you dare tell on us.

456
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:57,840
Fine.

457
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,840
Hey, ugly.

458
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,340
Get only the juice, all right?

459
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:04,340
Don't eat the sausage in the fridge.
It's Jung Bong's.

460
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,840
I won't!

461
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,840
Land.

462
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,840
Land is the best.

463
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,840
Mr. Choi, buy some land no matter what.

464
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,450
They say that the value of the land
in Ilsan is rising nowadays.

465
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:17,340
Geez... if you don't know anything,
don't talk.

466
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:20,340
What's there to see in Ilsan?
It's in the middle of nowhere!

467
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:25,340
Rather, it's safest to put
your money in a bank.

468
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:28,340
Geez... bank interest
doesn't even amount to much.

469
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:31,840
Of course, the interest rates
have decreased a bit

470
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:36,340
so it'll only be about 15 percent or so
but even so, you'll accrue interest.

471
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,840
There's no place safer than a bank.

472
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,340
You're going to put
all that money in a bank?

473
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,340
Mr. Choi.

474
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:47,340
Buy an apartment.
A great one, in Gangnam.

475
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:50,560
Um... what's it called?
Umma (Mom) Apartment, yes.

476
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,190
It's Eunma...

477
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:53,340
Yeah. Umma. Umma Apartment.

478
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:57,340
- Eunma. Eunma.
- That's what I just said! Umma. Umma.

479
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,340
I heard they go for 50,000,000 won.

480
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:03,340
What? How is an apartment
that much money?

481
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,340
Where is it?

482
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:26,340
- Anyway, congratulations, Mr. Choi!
- Yes. Thank you.

483
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:30,340
Meanwhile, our daughters
are busy blowing our money...

484
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:33,340
Mr. Choi is so lucky.

485
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,840
Mr. Kim, come sit down.
It's still not working?

486
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:42,340
Geez... you paid so much for it
but you don't know how to use it?

487
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,840
If it doesn't work, just give up
and come sit here!

488
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:48,340
Why are you fussing about putting on
some music in the middle of the day?

489
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:51,840
Then, let's just toast! Cheers!

490
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,340
Congratulations!

491
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,840
Thank you.

492
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:12,160
Jin Joo.

493
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,340
Does that taste good?

494
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,840
Can you give me just a bite?

495
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,340
Here, here, here!

496
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,340
Here it is!

497
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,840
Who could that be?

498
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,840
Who could that be?

499
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,170
I think someone's here.

500
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,440
Mr. Choi.

501
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,440
What did I say before?

502
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,440
Excuse me?

503
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:49,440
What did I tell you to buy
if you got a lot of money?

504
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,120
An apartment.

505
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:03,120
Here, get up.

506
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,620
Everyone, get up! Yeah!

507
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,620
All right!

508
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,120
Took you long enough.

509
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,620
They're at it again.

510
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,120
Who's the featured singer today?

511
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,120
The usual.

512
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,620
- My mom...
- And my dad.

513
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,620
Taek.

514
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,620
Do you have anything you want
for your birthday?

515
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,620
Yeah. Tell us before you leave for China.

516
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:16,620
Do you listen to music?

517
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,620
He only listens to
Deulgukhwa.

518
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:21,620
Oh, yeah. Jeon In Kwon's
solo album is out. Do you want that?

519
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,620
Kim Jung Hwan, you heard him, right?

520
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,620
- Buy it.
- No, thanks.

521
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,620
Hey.

522
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,620
Brazil Ddukbokki is going to close soon.

523
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,820
They close early on Saturdays.

524
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,120
Where are you going?

525
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,120
To eat ddukbokki!

526
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,620
Goodbye!

527
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:07,620
<i>After the ceremony last night
at 7:00 p.m. at the Seoul Olympic Stadium</i>

528
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,620
<i>the 1988 Seoul Olympics
has come to a close.</i>

529
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:14,120
<i>The Seoul Olympics,
in which 159 countries participated</i>

530
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:17,120
<i>had the Soviet Union get first place,
with 55 gold medals</i>

531
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,620
<i>and East Germany in second place,
with 37 gold medals.</i>

532
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:23,620
<i>Korea came in fourth place
with 33 gold medals</i>

533
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,620
<i>and performed quite well
during the Olympics.</i>

534
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,620
Hey, get up!

535
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,620
Why does he always shift down
in his sleep?

536
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,620
Get up, Sung No Eul!
You have to go to school!

537
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,620
- What time is it?
- 6:30 a.m. Eat and wash up.

538
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,620
Hello? Mom!

539
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:48,120
<i>Oh... you're awake?
What about food?</i>

540
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:51,620
We're eating now. How's Granny?
Is Granny okay?

541
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:54,620
<i>She's not doing so well. I have to stay
here a couple more days.</i>

542
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,620
<i>Did you pack the lunches?</i>

543
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,120
Yeah.

544
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,620
What about Dad? Is he okay?

545
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,620
<i>He's fine. He's doing well.</i>

546
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,120
<i>Did you wake up your older sister?</i>

547
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,120
<i>She has to go to school
early today.</i>

548
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,620
Whatever.
I'm sure she'll wake up on her own.

549
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,120
Bo Ra. Wake up and eat breakfast.

550
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,620
Damn it...

551
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:36,120
Why, I ought to... kill you...

552
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,620
She says she's not eating.

553
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:47,120
I told her she has to eat.

554
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,120
Tell her I said that.

555
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,620
She said, "I told her she has to eat."

556
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,620
Damn it!

557
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:05,620
Tell Sung Duk Seon
to stuff her own damn face.

558
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,620
Okay.

559
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:13,120
She told you to stuff her own damn face.

560
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:17,120
Tell her that, if she doesn't stuff her
damn face, I'll wash up first!

561
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,120
Damn it...

562
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:30,620
She says, "If you don't stuff your
damn face, I'll wash up first!"

563
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:34,120
Tell her to do that
if she has a death wish!

564
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,120
Okay.

565
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:45,120
She said, "Do that
if you have a death wish."

566
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:49,620
Is this fun for you?
Huh? I ought to kill you!

567
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:52,620
Damn it! You're all psychopaths!

568
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:54,620
Ow!

569
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,120
Mommy...

570
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,620
Damn it!

571
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,120
Is there no hierarchy
in this house?

572
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,620
Why are you washing up first?

573
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:30,320
You didn't wash up when you were
supposed to! I'm going to be late!

574
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,720
I told you last night that
I was washing up first, didn't I?

575
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,720
Then why don't you get up early
and wash up first?

576
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,720
What? "You?"

577
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,620
You think you're a freaking queen
or something?

578
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,620
"You?"

579
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:40,120
Yeah, "you!"

580
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,620
Hey!

581
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,620
I'm going to go insane!

582
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,120
Hey!

583
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,120
- Get over here.
- Hey!

584
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,120
I'm telling Mom!

585
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,620
Let go. Let go!

586
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,620
You know what we're doing tonight, right?

587
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,620
- Yeah.
- What?

588
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,220
Look at you,
acting like you don't know.

589
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,220
We promised to go
to the 19 and over movie theater.

590
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,220
Oh... yeah.

591
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:34,120
I heard that it's a lot better
than the last one.

592
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,120
Ew. Ew!

593
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:43,120
Just what the hell
did your mother make?

594
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,820
I feel like my tongue
is going to fall off!

595
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:47,120
It's better than your crappy
instant noodle lunch!

596
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:50,620
You know about lunchtime, right?

597
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,120
What is it now?

598
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,120
Soccer, bastard!

599
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,720
I'm not playing with Crazy Mutt.
I don't want to break my ankle.

600
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,620
He's always singling me out!
He's a total psycho!

601
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:02,620
It's fine. He's a nice guy.

602
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,120
And what do you base that on?

603
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,120
He doesn't smoke.

604
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,620
Does that automatically mean
that he's a nice guy?

605
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:10,620
Yeah.

606
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,620
Geez... you're so simple.
Are you an amoeba?

607
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:14,620
Anyway, show up. Okay?

608
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:16,620
Whatever. I'm sleeping
during lunchtime.

609
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:18,620
Crazy bastard.
Why are you sleeping during lunch

610
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:20,720
when you don't even have
to do your class rep duties?

611
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,020
Jung Hwan says he'll cover you.

612
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,920
Sun Woo. Sun Woo! Please?

613
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,120
If you're not there,
who's going to score goals for us?

614
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,620
Tell me, who? Please?

615
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,620
No.

616
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:39,120
Sun Woo. Please?

617
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,120
I'll kill you.

618
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:03,120
Stop reading romance novels
already, you two.

619
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:09,020
Aren't you tired of them by now?
What's this?

620
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,120
<i>[An Officer and a Princess]</i>

621
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,620
"An Officer and a Princess?"

622
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:17,620
"He headed straight,
toward her lips."

623
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:20,620
"And he desired
her luscious lips deeply."

624
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,620
"However, she grew flustered."

625
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,620
"What flustered her was"

626
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:30,620
"not his rough lips, but the feeling of
his bare, rock hard chest against..."

627
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,520
Are you living out your fantasies
vicariously through these?

628
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,120
Whatever. Give it here.

629
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,620
Hey, come to your senses, already.

630
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:40,120
There are no guys like this
in real life.

631
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:43,120
"Bare, rock hard chest," my ass.

632
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:48,120
Hey. Ben Johnson.
He has the best body.

633
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,620
Hey, hit them no matter what.

634
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:55,620
Do it when the referee isn't watching,
okay?

635
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:56,620
Okay.

636
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:59,120
If we lose again today,
I'm going to hit you upside the head.

637
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,120
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

638
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,120
Let's work hard.

639
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,120
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

640
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,120
Why aren't these bastards coming?

641
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,620
Hurry up and get your asses over here!

642
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:30,120
You take care of Crazy Mutt.

643
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,820
You know that
I hate guys like him, right?

644
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:35,620
Geez.

645
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,120
I got that goal in.

646
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,620
Geez... damn it.

647
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,120
Did you see that? He can't get it in.

648
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:47,620
Over here, over here!

649
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,120
Damn it.

650
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,120
<i>[Audition of Love]</i>

651
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:17,620
This one is a bit weak.

652
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:19,320
They don't get further
than just kissing.

653
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:21,620
Throw it out.

654
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:29,120
Don't disappoint me.

655
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:33,120
Give me some raunchy passages, okay?

656
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:36,620
Duk Seon!

657
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,620
The teacher is looking for you.

00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:55,620
Hey... what do I do?

659
00:41:56,620 --> 00:42:00,120
If you get caught,
just say that they're mine.

660
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,620
All you did was bring them to me.

661
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,620
Okay?

662
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,120
Duk Seon.

663
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,620
Yes, Teacher?

664
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,120
Pick up the phone.

665
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,120
It's from your family.

666
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,120
What?

667
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:32,120
Hello? Who is it?

668
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:43,620
If it weren't for Crazy Mutt,
we could have won 5-0.

669
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,620
No, 10-0.

670
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,620
Hey, what time is the movie tonight?

671
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,120
We can just skip night class, right?

672
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:51,620
Three o'clock.

673
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:53,720
You crazy bastard...
we're going to miss Math class!

674
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,620
No, Crazy Mutt...
the three of them are coming!

675
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:56,620
What?

676
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:58,620
Get out of my way.

677
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,620
You guys are real friendly.

00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,120
Yes, sir. We're friends.

679
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,620
Hey, Student Council President.

680
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,620
You're all right at soccer.

681
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:13,620
Why don't you be the MVP from now on?

00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:18,620
You do it!

683
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:22,620
Wow, look at his glare.

684
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:30,620
What are you going to do
by just glaring at me, huh?

685
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:33,820
You think you're hot shit
because you're the President?

686
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:38,620
And what's this? Is it a necklace?

687
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:42,620
Take it off, bastard.

688
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,620
A student can't wear
a necklace to school.

689
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:46,620
Huh?

690
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:50,120
You have to set an example
for the rest of the students, right, sir?

691
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:55,120
I said take it off, bastard.
Take it off.

692
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:57,120
Take it off!

693
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:02,620
Are you deaf?

694
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:05,620
I said, take it off,
bastard!

695
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,120
Hey.

696
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:11,620
We'll be late to our next class.
Come on.

697
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:12,620
Let's go.

698
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:15,120
This son of a bitch...

699
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,620
See you next time.

700
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:19,620
I'll kill you.

701
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,620
You dropped something.

702
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:36,620
Damn it... let's go.

703
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:38,120
We have orchestra.

704
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:45,120
Can't you just take that off
for a little bit?

705
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:47,620
My dad gave this to me,
how could I take it off?

706
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:50,120
Why can't you?
You can just put it back on later.

707
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:53,620
Geez... you're so frustrating.

708
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:08,620
<i>Don't cry. Pack your bag and come.</i>

709
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,120
Bo Ra.

710
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,120
Bo Ra!

711
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,620
<i>It's okay. Stop crying.</i>

712
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:19,120
<i>Granny is in a better place now.</i>

713
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:23,620
<i>I told your teacher everything
so pack your bag quickly and come.</i>

714
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:25,120
Bo Ra!

715
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:27,120
<i>No Eul is coming, too.</i>

716
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:30,120
<i>There isn't much time. Hurry and come.</i>

717
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:32,120
Bo Ra!

718
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:59,120
Hurry and go to sleep.

719
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,120
It'll be a while until we get to Goksung.

720
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:03,120
You won't be able to sleep there.

721
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:41,030
<i>[Funeral Condolences]</i>

722
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:57,620
Okay. I won't cry anymore.

723
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:00,620
Are you sadder than Dad?

724
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:06,620
Don't you cry, either.

725
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:08,620
We have to console Dad.

726
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:12,620
Let's go.

727
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:56,120
Is this really a funeral?

728
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:58,620
It feels more like a party.

729
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:02,120
This is Granny's house... right?

730
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:09,690
Bo Ra, you're here? Eat.

731
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:24,120
Where did Dad go?

732
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:26,620
I only see our aunts.

733
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:35,620
What if Dad is sick?

734
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:39,120
Oh. Hey, Bo Ra!

735
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:48,120
Dad...

736
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:52,620
What are you doing? Say hello.

737
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:57,620
Sir! This is my eldest, Bo Ra.

738
00:48:57,620 --> 00:49:01,620
She goes to Seoul University,
the best college in the nation!

739
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:03,120
She's a student there!

740
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,120
- Hello.
- Yes, yes!

741
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,620
You're Bo Ra?

742
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:08,620
When did she grow up to be a lady?

743
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:12,620
Wow, you're so pretty
and study well to boot!

744
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:18,620
We couldn't send her to cram school
because we have no money

745
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:19,620
or get her a tutor.

746
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:25,620
Even so, she studied up all on her own.

747
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:31,120
And... this is my second eldest,
Duk Seon.

748
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:35,120
She's the one who was on TV!

749
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:39,120
This is Duk Seon! I saw her on TV!

750
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:44,620
Hey... after this is over,
let's take a photo together!

751
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:47,120
Yes, yes.

752
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:55,120
I heard that holding those picket signs
is really competitive.

753
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:59,620
Since you're seen on
international television and all.

754
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:04,120
I heard hundreds and thousands
competed for a spot!

755
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:07,120
That's amazing.

756
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:12,620
Oh yes, and the one on the end
is my youngest, No Eul.

757
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:17,620
He's more filial son than he seems.

758
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:20,620
He looks kind.

759
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:22,120
Sir. It's me, Jae Young.

760
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,620
You must be so mournful.

761
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:27,120
Oh my, Jae Young! You punk!

762
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:30,620
Wow, it's really been a while!

763
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:33,020
Wow... you look like you're
doing well for yourself nowadays!

764
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:34,120
No, sir.

765
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:36,620
Sit down, and let's have a drink.

766
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:37,620
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

767
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:46,620
Bo Ra. Is Dad a cyborg?

768
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:49,620
How could he not shed
even one tear?

769
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:55,620
Wow... it's really been a long time
since I've seen you.

770
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:59,580
- Yes.
-

771
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:02,120
Are all adults like that?
They don't get sad?

772
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:04,620
Shush. Just keep frying these.

773
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:07,120
Our aunts, too.
It's their mother.

774
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:09,020
Is this the time to be
showing off her ring?

775
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:11,820
I told you, it's white gold!

776
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:15,120
White gold? Please.
This is so much better.

777
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:17,120
Just look at the design.

778
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:19,620
I feel so bad for Granny.

779
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:25,620
Geez... take the younger kids
and go to sleep.

780
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:28,120
I'll take care of this.

781
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:30,120
Uncle isn't coming?

782
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:32,620
We gave him a call as soon as
Granny passed out.

783
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:34,920
He didn't even to be by her side
during her final moments.

784
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:37,120
I'm sure he'll be here tomorrow.

785
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:39,620
It's not like the U.S.
is around the corner.

786
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:41,820
And there's nothing that can be done
if he can't come.

787
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:45,120
I feel so bad for Granny...

788
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:49,620
Stop crying.

789
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:51,120
I won't stand for it anymore.

790
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:53,120
What? I can't even cry if I want to?

791
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:54,620
You little...

792
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:59,120
Stop it. Other people are watching.

793
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:20,620
But... what if there are cops there?

794
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:23,620
You know how busy
Korean police officers are?

795
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:26,120
Why would they waste time
being there?

796
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:28,620
That's nonsense.

797
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:54,760
Why are the cops...
was there a thief?

798
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:58,120
It's probably because today's
the premiere. Tomorrow will be fine.

799
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:00,120
- You want to come back tomorrow?
- Of course!

800
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:03,620
- Let's go.
- Where? Back to school?

801
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:05,620
- Are you crazy? No. Taek's place.
- Why?

802
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:09,120
An erotic love tale among mulberry trees,
as sweet as honey.

803
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:12,440
I borrowed a steamy one.

804
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:17,950
Taxi!

805
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:10,620
I'm off!

806
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:14,120
Sun Woo!

807
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:17,120
You're going to be late
again today, right?

808
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:18,620
Uh... yeah.

809
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:19,620
Oh yeah, Mom.

810
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:21,120
When are you going to Goksong?

811
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:24,620
Tomorrow. I was going to go
with everyone in town.

812
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:26,920
Sun Woo. Your lunch will
be cold by dinnertime.

813
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:29,620
Buy yourself some cup noodles
to eat with it. How much do you need?

814
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:30,620
I only need 500 won.

815
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:33,120
Here's your lunch.

816
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:36,620
Eat it with some cup noodles.
How much is it?

817
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:38,620
10,000 won.

818
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:40,120
Want to die?

819
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:43,620
I'm off.

820
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:49,120
Oh my God! Geez.

821
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:52,120
Mother. Please just give me 10 won.

822
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:56,120
With just 10 won, I can play all day
with an Olympic legend.

823
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:58,120
Study, damn it.

824
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:01,620
Mother, please just give me 10 won!

825
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:55,120
Here he is.

826
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:58,120
Dong Il, wake up and have breakfast.

827
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:01,120
Okay? Breakfast.

828
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,620
Let's eat.

829
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:04,620
Geez... eat up.

830
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:06,620
Put the rice in the soup.

831
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:08,120
Oh. Thanks...

832
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:12,620
You didn't make any seasoned clams?
How come?

833
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:14,320
You don't need so much food
in the morning.

834
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:16,120
Eat it while it's still warm.

835
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:17,620
Okay.

836
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:22,120
Wow. This soup is great.

837
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:29,620
Wow. Rich kids are really
on a different level.

838
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:31,620
Here we go.

839
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:36,120
It's kimchi.

840
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:38,120
What the hell?
You only have kimchi?

841
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:40,120
Let's see what else.

842
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:45,120
Curry and rice.

843
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:48,120
Then eat that for dinner.

844
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:50,620
I think I will. I had curry
for breakfast, too.

845
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:53,120
All right.

846
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:58,120
Side dishes? Nope, none.

847
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:01,620
Do we have any soup?

848
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:04,620
No, we do not.

849
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:08,620
Then... kimchi fried rice. Damn.

850
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:11,620
Hey, have some of mine.

851
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:17,620
Wow, sausages.
It's hard to make these taste bad.

852
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:19,120
Shall I try one?

853
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:23,620
Ugh, it's so salty!

854
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:27,620
Just what the hell does
your mom make every day?

855
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:29,620
I think this tastes fine.

856
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:31,620
Huh?

857
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:35,120
Oh, it's just an eggshell. It's fine.

858
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:39,120
At your house, no one could gain
weight no matter how hard they tried.

859
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:40,620
Ugh, so salty.

860
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:46,620
Don't forget... round two today.

861
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:50,620
The cops are probably going to
be there today, too.

862
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:54,120
That's why I came prepared.

863
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:58,120
You guys are just nerds
with no street smarts.

864
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:08,620
What about dinner, though?
My mom packed me extra food.

865
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:10,620
It's all eggshell-encrusted
sausages, anyway.

866
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:13,620
I'll buy today.
Hamburgers. You down?

867
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:15,120
Of course.

868
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:17,120
We don't have much time. Strip!

869
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:27,620
Three soldiers.

870
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:44,120
Hey, wait.

871
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,620
I have to go to the bathroom.

872
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:48,620
What, already?

873
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:51,620
You crazy bastard.

874
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:23,620
Sun Woo.

875
00:59:23,620 --> 00:59:27,460
He wants you to come over here, too.

876
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:45,120
Look at Uncle.
He's acting like nothing's wrong.

877
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:47,120
Hey. Even his wife, the daughter,
is acting fine.

878
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:49,620
So why would he be any different?

879
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:09,120
Bo Ra. Why are they singing?

880
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:18,620
Way to go, you little shits.

881
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:22,620
You're third years with
important exams coming up!

882
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:24,620
Are you bastards out of your mind?

883
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:28,620
You think you'll make it into college,
at this rate?

884
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:31,120
You really must be out of your
goddamned minds.

885
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:33,650
How dare you come here?

886
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:35,620
Geez... these bastards.

887
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:46,120
Oh, look here.
Isn't this my son?

888
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:47,920
You must be so busy studying, sir.

889
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:49,720
So how did you make time
to wander down here?

890
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:50,820
- Hello, Father.
- Yes, yes.

891
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:54,120
You see, I was just going to have partake
in some cultural education, and then...

892
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:55,520
What the hell did you say, bastard?

893
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:56,620
Cultural education, my ass.

894
01:00:56,620 --> 01:01:01,120
- Why I ought to...
- Ow... Father, Father!

895
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:03,120
Who's your father, huh?

896
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:07,120
I'm sure your father died
from being worried sick about you!

897
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:11,620
If you're shit at studying,
don't cause any trouble, at least.

898
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:13,120
You useless little...

899
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:21,120
Geez.

900
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:24,620
Consider yourselves saved
thanks to Sun Woo. Got that?

901
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:25,620
All right?

902
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:29,120
Come to the teacher's lounge
after classes tomorrow. Got that?

903
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:30,120
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

904
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:31,120
- Got that?
- Yes sir!

905
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:32,120
Got that?

906
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,120
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

907
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:36,620
I'll see you later at home...

908
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:40,120
Don't you dare think about
coming home tonight, bastard.

909
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:44,040
I respect you, Father!

910
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:53,620
Wow, Mr. President.

911
01:01:54,620 --> 01:01:58,120
Why don't we chat for a sec?

912
01:01:58,510 --> 01:01:59,510
Hey.

913
01:02:00,510 --> 01:02:01,510
Hey.

914
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:03,470
Thanks.

915
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:06,630
How can I ever repay this debt to you?

916
01:02:06,630 --> 01:02:08,630
- Upperclassman, it's not like that...
- Back off.

917
01:02:13,270 --> 01:02:17,770
Hey, Mr. President.
I said thank you.

918
01:02:17,770 --> 01:02:18,770
All right?

919
01:02:23,770 --> 01:02:25,270
Look at this asshole.

920
01:02:25,270 --> 01:02:27,270
His upperclassman
is saying something to him...

921
01:02:30,270 --> 01:02:31,270
What's this?

922
01:02:35,270 --> 01:02:36,770
I told you to take it off.

923
01:02:39,770 --> 01:02:41,770
Take it off, bastard!

924
01:02:46,270 --> 01:02:48,270
This bastard... hey.

925
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:51,770
That... that was Sun Woo's father's.

926
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:58,270
He got it as a keepsake
when his father passed away.

927
01:03:05,270 --> 01:03:07,270
So what?

928
01:03:07,770 --> 01:03:09,270
So what?

929
01:03:10,770 --> 01:03:13,270
Can you disrespect your elders
because you have no dad?

930
01:03:14,270 --> 01:03:16,270
You proud that you don't
have a dad or something?

931
01:03:16,770 --> 01:03:19,770
You flaunting that, bastard?

932
01:03:25,270 --> 01:03:27,770
Are you out of your mind,
you crazy bastard?

933
01:03:29,270 --> 01:03:32,370
You just say whatever the hell comes
out of that shithole you call your mouth?

934
01:03:32,370 --> 01:03:34,170
Choose your words before
you speak, asshole.

It's almost 10:00 p.m.

938
01:03:58,770 --> 01:04:02,770
Tomorrow's the wake so if he can't
make it today, he won't come.

939
01:04:16,270 --> 01:04:19,610
Dad. Get some sleep.

940
01:04:21,770 --> 01:04:26,770
Geez... my pretty and kind daughter.

941
01:04:27,770 --> 01:04:30,270
Your Dad is fine.

942
01:04:30,770 --> 01:04:32,270
I'm fine.

Our poor mother...

947
01:05:52,270 --> 01:05:54,770
Our poor mother!

948
01:05:55,270 --> 01:05:59,270
Why did she have to go so soon?

949
01:05:59,770 --> 01:06:02,270
Why?

950
01:06:03,270 --> 01:06:06,270
Now we can't see her anymore!

951
01:06:07,770 --> 01:06:09,910
I want to see Mom...

952
01:06:11,170 --> 01:06:13,170
- Brother!
- You're here!

953
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:16,170
Why did you come so late?

954
01:06:17,170 --> 01:06:19,670
We waited for so long!

955
01:06:19,670 --> 01:06:22,170
You couldn't even say goodbye to her...

956
01:06:22,170 --> 01:06:25,670
Mom wanted to see you so much!

<i>It's just that adults keep it bottled up.</i>

958
01:06:35,670 --> 01:06:38,170
<i>They were just busy being adults</i>

959
01:06:38,170 --> 01:06:42,170
<i>and they just acted strong due to
the pressure that came with their age.</i>

960
01:06:44,170 --> 01:06:47,170
<i>Adults feel pain, too.</i>

961
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:50,170
I can't go on.

962
01:06:50,170 --> 01:06:53,170
I can't go on without my mother!

963
01:06:54,170 --> 01:06:55,170
Mom!

964
01:06:56,170 --> 01:06:59,170
Mother!

965
01:07:00,170 --> 01:07:03,170
Mother...

966
01:07:20,170 --> 01:07:25,170
Sit down.

967
01:07:30,170 --> 01:07:31,170
Give me your hand.

968
01:08:18,670 --> 01:08:19,670
Bye.

Can I sleep over at your place tonight?

971
01:08:24,170 --> 01:08:25,670
I don't want to face my dad.

972
01:08:26,170 --> 01:08:28,170
You think he won't know, you idiot?

973
01:08:34,670 --> 01:08:36,670
What do we do about your necklace?

974
01:08:36,670 --> 01:08:38,670
I'll just not wear it anymore.

975
01:08:39,670 --> 01:08:41,670
What about your face, though?

976
01:08:42,170 --> 01:08:44,170
Worry about yourself.

977
01:08:48,170 --> 01:08:49,170
Bye.

01:08:53,170 --> 01:08:54,170

Oh, you're home, my son?

984
01:10:05,170 --> 01:10:06,670
- Yes!
- Oh, my son!

985
01:10:06,670 --> 01:10:09,170
I'm going to go wash up. Go to sleep.

986
01:10:09,170 --> 01:10:10,170
Okay.

987
01:10:11,670 --> 01:10:16,670
Wow... my Sun Woo ate all of his lunch.
They were good, huh?

988
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:18,670
Yeah!
They were delicious!

You have to treat your parents well

01:11:18,170 --> 01:11:20,170
Is it a blackout?

1004
01:11:20,170 --> 01:11:22,170
I think it's just the bulb.

1005
01:11:22,670 --> 01:11:25,170
I'll go buy one. Give me some money.

1006
01:11:26,870 --> 01:11:29,170

tomorrow morning.

01:12:35,170 --> 01:12:40,670
Wow... our Taek is an adult now.

1015

Why are you bringing that up?

1022
01:13:11,670 --> 01:13:14,170
I'm going to start crying.

01:13:16,670 --> 01:13:19,170
That's right.

Hmm?

1030
01:14:04,670 --> 01:14:08,670

<i>An adult-like child is just one

It's going to blow out.
Hurry.

1048
01:15:50,370 --> 01:15:52,170
Hurry! One, two, three!

1049
01:15:54,170 --> 01:15:58,170
- Here, your present.
- Yay!

1050
01:15:58,170 --> 01:15:59,170
<i>[Jeon In Kwon]</i>

1051
01:15:59,170 --> 01:16:00,170
We're done now, right?

1052
01:16:00,170 --> 01:16:02,170
Where is it, huh? Hurry it up.

1053
01:16:02,170 --> 01:16:03,370
- Where is it?
- Take it out!

1054
01:16:03,370 --> 01:16:04,670
Here, here.

1055
01:16:04,670 --> 01:16:07,170
Hey, let's do this later.
Where is it?

1056
01:16:07,170 --> 01:16:09,670
Let's watch TV.

1057
01:16:09,670 --> 01:16:11,170
Hurry up and take it out!

1058
01:16:12,170 --> 01:16:13,670
Hey, let me see.

1059
01:16:13,670 --> 01:16:15,670
Where is it? Hey, lower the volume!

1060
01:16:15,670 --> 01:16:18,270
Taek, you're not going to eat
all this, right? I'm taking it home!

1061
01:16:18,270 --> 01:16:19,270
- Okay?
- Where is it?

1062
01:16:19,270 --> 01:16:21,170
Hey, it's obviously in his bag!
Geez!

1063
01:16:21,170 --> 01:16:22,170
Bag! Give me that.

1064
01:16:22,170 --> 01:16:24,170
Let me see. Open it.

1065
01:16:24,170 --> 01:16:26,170
All right, all right, all right!

1066
01:16:27,670 --> 01:16:29,670
It's a good one! Nice job!

1067
01:16:29,670 --> 01:16:32,170
Mom! These kids are drinking!

1068
01:16:32,170 --> 01:16:34,170
Stop screaming! Hey!

1069
01:16:36,170 --> 01:16:37,170
Ow!

1070
01:16:37,170 --> 01:16:39,170
They're drinking!

1071
01:16:39,170 --> 01:16:42,670
<i>Taek was the last one to move here.</i>

1072
01:17:19,170 --> 01:17:21,670
<i>After his mother passed away,
they left</i>

1073
01:17:21,670 --> 01:17:24,670
<i>her hometown which was
full of her scent and came to Seoul.</i>

1074
01:17:27,170 --> 01:17:31,670
<i>We don't know why this father and son
chose this block in particular</i>

1075
01:17:31,670 --> 01:17:32,750
<i>but what I am sure of</i>

1076
01:17:32,780 --> 01:17:38,670
<i>is that the four troublemakers of
this block found a new friend.</i>

1077
01:18:12,670 --> 01:18:15,670
<i>Taek was a quiet kid.</i>

1078
01:18:16,170 --> 01:18:22,170
<i>So the boisterous kids on this block
may have been too much for him.</i>

1079
01:19:38,170 --> 01:19:41,670
<i>Even so, Taek was always with us.</i>

1080
01:19:42,170 --> 01:19:44,670
<i>Even when we were
doing mischievous things</i>

1081
01:19:44,670 --> 01:19:48,170
<i>or doing pathetic things
he was always by our side.</i>

1082
01:19:49,170 --> 01:19:52,670
<i>Of course, he always had
an expressionless face.</i>

1083
01:19:52,670 --> 01:19:55,170
<i>But even so, he was with us.</i>

1084
01:20:02,170 --> 01:20:07,170
<i>Still, the block creates friendships
just through the power of time.</i>

1085
01:20:07,670 --> 01:20:12,670
<i>That is how the taciturn child
and the four noisy kids became friends.</i>

1086
01:20:12,670 --> 01:20:16,170
<i>And that's how we became five.</i>

1087
01:20:34,170 --> 01:20:36,170
Geez... really.

1088
01:20:38,170 --> 01:20:39,670
Just from drinking this?

1089
01:20:39,670 --> 01:20:42,170
And here, I thought you guys
could handle your liquor.

1090
01:20:47,170 --> 01:20:48,170
Hey.

1091
01:20:48,670 --> 01:20:51,670
Just try it, then. You'll die.

1092
01:20:53,170 --> 01:20:55,170
Who do you think I am?

1093
01:21:11,170 --> 01:21:12,170
Oh... hey!

1094
01:21:19,670 --> 01:21:22,170
Hey! You're all dead!

1095
01:21:22,170 --> 01:21:24,670
Ugh... ow!

1096
01:21:24,670 --> 01:21:27,170
Ugh... what do I do?

1097
01:21:47,170 --> 01:21:49,170
She's pretty. Joey Wang.

1098
01:21:50,170 --> 01:21:51,170
Yeah.

1099
01:21:54,670 --> 01:21:57,670
There's no such girl in real life.

1100
01:21:59,670 --> 01:22:01,670
Who do you think is the prettiest?

1101
01:22:02,670 --> 01:22:08,460
Um... Joey Wang.

1102
01:22:08,670 --> 01:22:11,170
We said there's no such woman
in real life.

1103
01:22:11,670 --> 01:22:14,570
I've also fallen for another girl
at Jung Yi Performing Arts High School.

1104
01:22:15,170 --> 01:22:18,670
The girl with the short hair
with the pale face?

1105
01:22:18,670 --> 01:22:20,670
How did you guys know?

1106
01:22:20,670 --> 01:22:23,670
Everyone has a crush on her.

1107
01:22:23,670 --> 01:22:27,670
Then... there's another girl
that I've fallen for, in the study room.

1108
01:22:27,670 --> 01:22:29,170
She's a Third Year with long hair.

1109
01:22:29,170 --> 01:22:30,670
She goes to a performing arts school.

1110
01:22:30,670 --> 01:22:32,170
And wears a white cardigan, right?

1111
01:22:33,670 --> 01:22:38,670
You little punks...
you don't study but only ogle at girls?

1112
01:22:42,170 --> 01:22:44,170
Who else has a pretty face?

1113
01:22:45,170 --> 01:22:46,170
Also...

1114
01:22:46,170 --> 01:22:47,670
You have another one?

1115
01:22:50,270 --> 01:22:53,170
Doesn't it seem like Duk Seon has
gotten just a little bit cuter, lately?

1116
01:22:57,170 --> 01:22:58,170
Huh?

1117
01:22:58,170 --> 01:22:59,170
Yeah.

1118
01:23:00,670 --> 01:23:02,670
Yeah. A little.

1119
01:23:04,670 --> 01:23:07,170
Hey, Taek. What about you?

1120
01:23:10,170 --> 01:23:11,170
Yeah.

1121
01:23:12,670 --> 01:23:13,670
Hey, Jung Hwan.

1122
01:23:13,670 --> 01:23:15,670
You all must be crazy!

1123
01:23:15,670 --> 01:23:17,670
You're all out of your minds.

1124
01:23:17,670 --> 01:23:19,670
Are you all drunk?

1125
01:23:21,170 --> 01:23:22,170
Geez.

1126
01:23:23,170 --> 01:23:24,170
Geez.

1127
01:23:24,170 --> 01:23:26,170
You've all had too much.

1128
01:23:26,670 --> 01:23:28,670
Dammit! You farted!

1129
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:29,670
Ew, it smells!

1130
01:23:29,670 --> 01:23:31,670
Stop that, already!

1131
01:23:31,670 --> 01:23:33,170
Why did you have to fart on us?

1132
01:23:34,170 --> 01:23:36,170
Damn it...

1133
01:24:00,170 --> 01:24:01,670

My diary!

1137
01:24:06,170 --> 01:24:07,170
No.

1138
01:24:07,170 --> 01:24:08,670
Yeah, you did!

1139
01:24:08,670 --> 01:24:10,670
I told you, I didn't. Stop being so loud.

1140
01:24:10,670 --> 01:24:12,670

so mind your own!

1141

Be quiet.

1147
01:24:32,170 --> 01:24:33,170
You did.

Mom! Duk Seon has someone she likes!

1158
01:25:08,670 --> 01:25:10,170
She even gave them chocolate!

<i>[2015]</i>

01:25:19,670 --> 01:25:21,870
How did I write these words
if I was sane at the time?

1162
01:25:23,170 --> 01:25:25,670
I want to throw it away,
but I don't know where I can.

1163
01:25:27,170 --> 01:25:29,670
I'm afraid to put it in the trash
in case someone finds it...

1164
01:25:31,670 --> 01:25:35,170
Oh my God... what nonsense.

1165
01:25:37,170 --> 01:25:39,170
You were a totally
rebellious kid back then.

1166
01:25:41,170 --> 01:25:43,670
Why did you spend time
with so many guys?

1167
01:25:47,170 --> 01:25:48,670
You read my diary, didn't you?

1168
01:25:51,170 --> 01:25:53,670
Wow. I can't believe you.

1169
01:25:53,670 --> 01:25:55,170
What the hell.

1170
01:25:56,170 --> 01:25:58,170
You read my diary, right?

1171
01:25:58,170 --> 01:26:01,170
- No.
- Yeah, you did!

1172
01:26:01,170 --> 01:26:02,170
I didn't.

1173
01:26:02,170 --> 01:26:05,170
Hey. Be honest with me.

01:26:05,670 --> 01:26:08,170
How can you say "hey"
to your husband?

1175
01:26:08,170 --> 01:26:11,170
If you can say it,
why can't I?

1176
01:26:11,170 --> 01:26:12,670
You did read it, didn't you?

1177

01:26:24,670 --> 01:26:27,170

01:26:27,170 --> 01:26:28,170
Huh? Why?

1182
01:26:28,170 --> 01:26:29,670
Who did you give it to?

1183

Geez... it was him.

01:27:05,170 --> 01:27:08,170
It's been almost 30 years,
