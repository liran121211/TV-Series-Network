Stop eating so much so late!
You'll fart up a storm later!

13
00:00:52,503 --> 00:00:57,703
Geez... the New Year's holiday is over,
and I have to go back to work tomorrow...

14
00:00:57,703 --> 00:01:00,304
I just want to hit somebody.

15
00:01:01,503 --> 00:01:05,504
It'd be nice if banks had vacations too,
huh? Right, Dad?

16
00:01:05,504 --> 00:01:08,203
Life really feels like it's worth living
because there's no school.

17
00:01:08,203 --> 00:01:09,804
You'll be a junior in high school soon!

18
00:01:09,804 --> 00:01:12,004
Don't you dare sink any lower
than 1000th place.

19
00:01:12,004 --> 00:01:14,004
What about Duk Seok?
She's in 1000th place too.

20
00:01:14,004 --> 00:01:17,804
Even so, she's never gotten lower
than 1000th place.

21
00:01:17,804 --> 00:01:19,302
She's better that you are, at least.

22
00:01:19,302 --> 00:01:24,703
Yeah. Last month, Duk Seon
jumped up 10 ranks.

23
00:01:24,703 --> 00:01:28,304
You little... speaking of which,
where's our little Miss 989th Place?

24
00:01:28,304 --> 00:01:30,403
Dooly Supermarket
to buy snacks.

25
00:01:30,403 --> 00:01:32,203
Wow, that girl has no fear.

26
00:01:32,203 --> 00:01:35,403
There are so many dangerous
street crimes lately.

27
00:02:07,703 --> 00:02:09,003
What's with you?

28
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:14,003
Damn it... hey, you surprised me!

29
00:02:14,003 --> 00:02:16,126
Why the hell were you following me?

30
00:02:16,126 --> 00:02:19,234
What are you talking about?
This is my house.

31
00:02:19,234 --> 00:02:21,133
Then make some noise
when you walk or something!

32
00:02:21,133 --> 00:02:23,932
What do you mean? Who does that?

33
00:02:23,932 --> 00:02:26,432
Hey, I was about to call out to you too.

34
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:28,633
But you walked so damn fast!
Is someone following you?

35
00:02:28,633 --> 00:02:30,832
You! You! You did!

36
00:02:30,832 --> 00:02:35,533
Who the hell followed who?
I was just walking home!

37
00:02:35,533 --> 00:02:38,533
- What's with you?
- I don't know! Whatever!

38
00:02:40,932 --> 00:02:43,033
- Hey!
- What?

39
00:02:51,832 --> 00:02:53,432
Good night.

40
00:03:56,832 --> 00:03:58,832
You bought it, Duk Seon?

41
00:03:59,832 --> 00:04:01,832
- Here.
- Thank you!

42
00:04:01,832 --> 00:04:02,932
What about Sung Bo Ra?

43
00:04:02,932 --> 00:04:05,033
Bo Ra? She's on a date.

44
00:04:05,033 --> 00:04:06,533
What? Didn't they break up?

45
00:04:06,533 --> 00:04:08,432
I think they got back together.

46
00:04:08,432 --> 00:04:12,134
Oh. So he's her first love, eh?

47
00:04:23,632 --> 00:04:28,334
Duk Seon. Who sings this song?

48
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:29,632
It's awesome.

49
00:04:29,632 --> 00:04:32,533
On the radio? It's Zoo.

50
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:33,932
Can't you tell?

51
00:04:33,932 --> 00:04:35,033
What's the title?

52
00:04:35,033 --> 00:04:37,932
<i>That was Zoo's "Hyehwa-dong."</i>

53
00:04:38,533 --> 00:04:43,334
<i>Listeners of "Starry Night,"
I have some great news.</i>

54
00:04:43,334 --> 00:04:50,132
<i>"Starry Night," which began in 1969
is now 20 years old this year.</i>

55
00:04:50,132 --> 00:04:55,334
<i>So we at "Starry Night"
had a bit of an outrageous idea.</i>

56
00:04:55,334 --> 00:04:57,334
<i>You're all curious as to
what it may be, right?</i>

57
00:04:58,834 --> 00:05:02,632
<i>"Starry Night" and musicians
who love our shows</i>

58
00:05:02,632 --> 00:05:08,533

a "Starry Night Jam Concert!"</i>

59
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:13,432
<i>I can hear our audience crying out
all the way from here.</i>

60
00:05:13,432 --> 00:05:16,334
<i>Yes, I hear it all the way
from MBC's office.</i>

61
00:05:17,533 --> 00:05:20,834
<i>Since this is our first Jam Concert</i>

62
00:05:20,834 --> 00:05:27,233
<i>a lot of great musicians from all over
Korea are coming to help us celebrate.</i>

63
00:05:27,233 --> 00:05:32,932
<i>First, on the guitar is Lee Chi Hyun
and Lee Moon Sae on the second guitar!</i>

64
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:34,533
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

65
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:37,334
<i>On the drums, Kim Soo Chul!</i>

66
00:05:37,334 --> 00:05:38,632
Wow!

67
00:05:38,632 --> 00:05:40,834
<i>On the piano, Woo Soon Shil!</i>

68
00:05:40,834 --> 00:05:42,733
<i>On the synthesizer, Kim Chang Nam!</i>

69
00:05:42,733 --> 00:05:46,132
<i>Oh, and this person...
he was really hard to get.</i>

70
00:05:46,132 --> 00:05:51,632
<i>On the bass guitar, Masam Trio's
Lee Soo Man!</i>

71
00:05:51,632 --> 00:05:52,632
Wow.

72
00:05:52,632 --> 00:05:54,432
<i>We have one more special...</i>

73
00:05:54,432 --> 00:05:57,132
Did you hear?
Lee Soo Man is playing the bass.

74
00:05:57,132 --> 00:05:58,334
The lineup sounds awesome!

75
00:05:58,334 --> 00:06:03,334
<i>A new comedian at "Starry Night,"
Lee Kyung Kyu!</i>

76
00:06:03,334 --> 00:06:06,334
Hey! The new comedian, Lee Kyung Kyu
is joining them, too!

77
00:06:06,334 --> 00:06:07,932
Who's funnier, me or him?

78
00:06:11,834 --> 00:06:12,932
Sun Woo.

79
00:06:12,932 --> 00:06:14,334
You're not sleeping?

80
00:06:14,334 --> 00:06:16,132
The floor is really warm.

81
00:06:17,033 --> 00:06:18,632
Go home and sleep.

82
00:06:18,632 --> 00:06:20,033
Your house is warmer.

83
00:06:20,033 --> 00:06:23,033
Would you be able to sleep in the
teacher's lounge, even if it were warm?

84
00:06:24,033 --> 00:06:25,834
I'm sleeping.

85
00:06:29,533 --> 00:06:31,632
Would you sleep in the teacher's lounge?

86
00:06:33,334 --> 00:06:35,233
Weirdo.

87
00:06:35,432 --> 00:06:39,834
<i>Anyone who loves "Starry Night"
is welcome!</i>

88
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:42,526
<i>Okay. Let's meet at the convention hall</i>

89
00:06:42,526 --> 00:06:45,632
<i>at Hanhwa 63 City at 8:00 p.m.
on January 11th.</i>

90
00:06:45,632 --> 00:06:50,932
<i>Now, with that bit of great news,
here's the last song.</i>

91
00:06:50,932 --> 00:06:52,733
<i>He's the eldest of the Masam Trio</i>

92
00:06:52,733 --> 00:06:58,334
<i>and the one taking on the bass
at our Jam Concert.</i>

93
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:01,834
<i>He went to the States for a bit
to buy a bass guitar.</i>

94
00:07:01,834 --> 00:07:05,233
<i>Here's Lee Soo Man's
"Happiness."</i>

95
00:07:56,733 --> 00:07:59,033
I don't see Mr. Choi today.

96
00:07:59,033 --> 00:08:01,432
Why isn't he out today?

97
00:08:03,132 --> 00:08:05,033
Taek!

98
00:08:05,033 --> 00:08:06,834
Where's your dad?

99
00:08:06,834 --> 00:08:08,432
Hello!

100
00:08:08,432 --> 00:08:10,834
Where's your dad?
He's not sweeping like usual.

101
00:08:10,834 --> 00:08:15,533
He went to Gimhae.
His best friend passed out.

102
00:08:15,533 --> 00:08:16,932
Oh no.

103
00:08:17,432 --> 00:08:20,833
Then come over, Taek!
Let's have breakfast together.

104
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,432
I made braised short ribs!

105
00:08:23,432 --> 00:08:25,333
Ah... yes!

106
00:08:25,932 --> 00:08:28,133
Madam, me too.

107
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:29,533
Did your mother go somewhere?

108
00:08:29,533 --> 00:08:31,633
No. I just want to eat
braised short ribs.

109
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:56,533
Is my place the Red Cross
or something?

110
00:08:56,533 --> 00:08:58,033
What's that?

111
00:08:58,033 --> 00:08:59,133
It's a charity.

112
00:08:59,133 --> 00:09:00,133
Oh.

113
00:09:02,133 --> 00:09:05,133
Speaking of which,
why are you here, Dong Ryong?

114
00:09:05,133 --> 00:09:07,633
Go eat at your own place!
You guys are well off, too.

115
00:09:07,633 --> 00:09:10,933
My mom left for work early,
and the dean's making curry.

116
00:09:10,933 --> 00:09:13,133
How could I not come,
when there's braised short ribs?

117
00:09:13,133 --> 00:09:15,432
How did you know that there were
braised short ribs here?

118
00:09:15,432 --> 00:09:18,833
I can hear everything from my room.
Your father went to Gimhae?

119
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:20,633
Let's watch a video in your room today.

120
00:09:23,533 --> 00:09:24,933
Madam!

121
00:09:24,933 --> 00:09:26,333
Oh, you're here?

122
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,333
Hey, come and eat.

123
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,833
No thanks. I already ate.

124
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:31,633
Can you tell your mom
that we enjoyed the japchae?

125
00:09:31,633 --> 00:09:32,633
Sure.

126
00:09:34,734 --> 00:09:38,333
Oh yeah. They're having the Starry Night
Jam Concert next week!

127
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:39,333
Let's go together.

128
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,433
It's not pronounced "Jam,"
it's "Jem."

129
00:09:41,433 --> 00:09:43,533
Good for you.

130
00:09:43,533 --> 00:09:46,333
Anyway, let's go! Lee Moon Sae,
Lee Chi Hyun, Lee Soo Man!

131
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:50,633
And... naturally... boing!
Lee Kyung Kyu!

132
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:51,833
Boing!

133
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,133
I'm down.

134
00:09:53,133 --> 00:09:54,133
What about you?

135
00:09:54,133 --> 00:09:56,333
I have a competition.

136
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:58,833
I want to go too, but I can't.

137
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,234
- I have...
- Whatever. Don't care.

138
00:10:00,234 --> 00:10:01,234
Dong Ryong, let's go.

139
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:03,833
I'm going to Jeju Island next week
to visit my older brother.

140
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,633
What the hell?

141
00:10:05,633 --> 00:10:07,833
So you guys want me to go alone
with Jung Hwan?

142
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,633
Let's go next time, then.

143
00:10:10,533 --> 00:10:12,133
I'm going.

144
00:10:15,133 --> 00:10:18,833
Just come. I thought you
liked Lee Moon Sae.

145
00:10:23,734 --> 00:10:25,133
Mom!

146
00:10:25,133 --> 00:10:26,633
Where's the crispy rice?

147
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:30,333
Didn't you say you bought
concert tickets too, Sun Woo?

148
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:31,433
For a Lee Sun Hee concert?

149
00:10:31,433 --> 00:10:32,433
Lee Sun Hee?

150
00:10:32,433 --> 00:10:34,734
The one who wears round glasses?

151
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:36,933
Wow... how do you know
who Lee Sun Hee is?

152
00:10:36,933 --> 00:10:38,333
I thought you only knew
Deulgukhwa.

153
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,734
Sun Woo lent me some of her tapes.

154
00:10:39,734 --> 00:10:41,433
When's the concert?

155
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:44,433
The 28th. But you can't come.

156
00:10:44,433 --> 00:10:45,433
What?

157
00:10:45,433 --> 00:10:47,133
I only have two tickets.

158
00:10:49,133 --> 00:10:50,633
Who are you going with, then?

159
00:10:51,633 --> 00:10:53,033
Thanks, Sun Woo.

160
00:10:53,033 --> 00:10:55,833
What are you saying?
You can't come either.

161
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,833
I have someone I'm going with.

162
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,234
What are you doing here?

163
00:11:22,533 --> 00:11:26,033
Bo Ra. Come to the
Lee Sun Hee concert with me.

164
00:11:26,033 --> 00:11:28,633
I don't want to. Why would I?

165
00:11:28,633 --> 00:11:32,333
It's just a concert ticket.
It has no deep meaning behind it.

166
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:33,833
Even so, I'm not going with you.

167
00:11:37,234 --> 00:11:41,133
I held back all this time
because I know you're a good kid.

168
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:45,633
Yeah... you're going through puberty,
so this kind of thing is normal.

169
00:11:45,633 --> 00:11:49,133
That's why I let you off the hook, but...
but I won't be so generous anymore.

170
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,133
Stop messing around.

171
00:11:52,133 --> 00:11:54,633
You're only my
younger sister's friend to me.

172
00:11:54,633 --> 00:11:56,433
To me, you're just Duk Seon's friend.

173
00:11:56,433 --> 00:11:58,933
So... don't cross the line anymore.

174
00:11:58,933 --> 00:12:02,333
The fact that you keep doing things like
this makes me annoyed and uncomfortable.

<i>[Episode 9: What it Means to
Cross the Line]</i>

176
00:12:26,734 --> 00:12:29,033
Wow... that was freaking awesome!

177
00:12:29,033 --> 00:12:31,734
- They were right next to me!
- Ow!

178
00:12:31,734 --> 00:12:33,833
Stop it! That hurts!

179
00:12:34,133 --> 00:12:35,633
What's with you?

180
00:12:35,633 --> 00:12:37,033
It's so cold.

181
00:12:37,033 --> 00:12:40,133
So why'd you wear a skirt?

182
00:12:40,133 --> 00:12:42,033
Geez... you have no common sense.

183
00:12:45,533 --> 00:12:47,833
How would you go on
without me?

184
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,133
What are you talking about?

185
00:12:51,133 --> 00:12:54,033
You know, since you seem to live off
the joy you get from tormenting me!

186
00:12:54,033 --> 00:12:57,633
Also, when a girl says she's cold, a guy
should give her his jacket or something!

187
00:12:57,633 --> 00:13:00,133
Are you crazy? Why should I?

188
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:05,533
Um... I'm sorry, but could you
take a photo of us?

189
00:13:05,533 --> 00:13:06,533
Yes, of course.

190

191

Thank you. I'll take
one for you two, too.

192
00:13:23,433 --> 00:13:25,333
- Oh, no thank--
- Yes, thank you.

00:14:08,734 --> 00:14:10,833
Look at how he put his hand
on my shoulder.

202
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:14,133
Look at that expression.
He's so happy.

203
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:18,933
Well, she was pretty back then.

204
00:14:19,633 --> 00:14:21,033
What about now, honey?

205
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,033
Want me to pass you a mirror?

206
00:14:24,033 --> 00:14:26,433
Ow! Hey!

207
00:14:34,633 --> 00:14:36,333
What's this?

208
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,433
He's had the store closed
for so long.

209
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:44,633
He's the type to keep the store open
even on holidays, though...

210
00:14:45,933 --> 00:14:47,433
Sun Young!

211

How could this happen?

Are we already at this age?

218
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:50,833
Is 45 years old really an acceptable age
to die?

219
00:15:52,033 --> 00:15:59,433
His young girl is just 10 years old.

220
00:16:01,033 --> 00:16:03,633
There's no set order
when it comes to dying.

221
00:16:03,633 --> 00:16:06,833
This is just the way life is.

222
00:16:07,734 --> 00:16:09,833
What's the point of living intensely?

223
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:14,734
People live and die in a day.

00:16:27,933 --> 00:16:30,133
All right!

226
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,933
I don't see Jung Bong around.
Did he go somewhere?

227
00:16:34,933 --> 00:16:36,633
Oh. He went to a Buddhist temple.

228
00:16:37,433 --> 00:16:39,133
A Buddhist temple?

229
00:16:39,133 --> 00:16:40,734
Why? Is he sick again?

230
00:16:40,734 --> 00:16:43,033
No. He said he's just going
to get some fresh air.

231
00:16:43,033 --> 00:16:46,133
I guess he wants to think about
a lot of things on his own.

232
00:16:46,133 --> 00:16:48,133
- Oh.
- He really likes Buddhist temples.

233
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:49,833
He's the only Buddhist
in our family.

234
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:52,834
Even so, I'm sure the food there
won't suit his tastes.

235
00:16:53,733 --> 00:16:56,633
Do you know what Jung Bong likes most
after ramyun?

236
00:16:56,633 --> 00:16:58,433
- Huh?
- Herbs and greens.

237
00:16:58,433 --> 00:17:01,933
He goes nuts for bibimbap
with greens and herbs in it.

238
00:17:01,933 --> 00:17:04,833
It's not easy to gain weight
on herbs and greens either, you know.

239
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:39,833
Um, excuse me, sir...

240

00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:50,433
He said he's left the store
for too long.

344
00:23:50,433 --> 00:23:54,032
I guess he must have been really close
to him to have left his store that long.

345
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:55,634
They were like
the Three Musketeers.

346
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:59,933
My Dad, Mr. Tae Yong, and
the one who passed away.

347
00:23:59,933 --> 00:24:01,532
Is that right?

348
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:03,433
Thank you for the meal.

349
00:24:03,433 --> 00:24:05,433
Sure! Eat up!

350
00:24:05,433 --> 00:24:06,933
Hello?

351
00:24:06,933 --> 00:24:10,134
Yeah. Yes.
What's up?

352
00:24:10,134 --> 00:24:12,833
Okay, hold on.
I'll be right over.

353
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:15,933
I'm going to Sun Woo's for a bit.
Eat up, Taek.

354
00:24:15,933 --> 00:24:17,833
- Yes.
- If you want more rice, ask Duk Seon--

355
00:24:18,933 --> 00:24:22,032
I'm helping him out!
He doesn't eat that much.

356
00:24:24,433 --> 00:24:26,333
<i>[Seoul District Court,
Northern Branch Decision]</i>

357
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:28,532
That mother-in-law is just too much.

358
00:24:28,532 --> 00:24:32,433
What about her grandkids?
She wants to throw them on the street?

359
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:37,433
She says that she'll raise them.

360
00:24:37,433 --> 00:24:39,532
And she said if I don't like that

361
00:24:39,532 --> 00:24:42,634
I should sell this house
and move to a smaller one.

362
00:24:42,634 --> 00:24:44,933
What a twisted old bitch!

363
00:24:44,933 --> 00:24:47,333
Geez... she pisses me off!

364
00:24:47,833 --> 00:24:52,134
But where will you get 10 million won?
Geez...

365
00:24:52,134 --> 00:24:54,532
You have to give it to the bank
by the end of this month?

366
00:24:54,532 --> 00:24:55,532
Yes.

367
00:24:55,532 --> 00:24:58,933
If I repay the money to a nice bank
by the end of the month

368
00:24:58,933 --> 00:25:03,634
they said that the foreclosure thing
will automatically disappear.

369
00:25:03,634 --> 00:25:06,233
She's basically telling me to go die.

370
00:25:06,233 --> 00:25:11,032
I barely manage to scrape by
every month with 300,000 won.

371
00:25:11,032 --> 00:25:13,634
Where will I get 10 million won?

372
00:25:14,333 --> 00:25:16,933
She's telling me to go die!

373
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:19,833
Geez... if it were just a couple
million won, I could do something...

374
00:25:19,833 --> 00:25:25,333
but I spent a lot last month on
Jung Bong's surgery so I don't have much.

375
00:25:25,833 --> 00:25:28,232
Even so, I'll try my best
to try and get some money for you.

376
00:25:28,232 --> 00:25:31,433
I have about 2 million won
that I hid away from my husband.

377
00:25:31,433 --> 00:25:34,634
I'll go and borrow money
from some people I know.

378
00:25:34,634 --> 00:25:36,634
No, no, it's fine!

379
00:25:36,634 --> 00:25:39,833
Please don't say things like that.

380
00:25:39,833 --> 00:25:42,032
I have a sense of decency.

381
00:25:42,032 --> 00:25:46,634
I'm sure the money I've borrowed from
you both amounts to a lot as it is.

382
00:25:47,134 --> 00:25:50,634
This time, I'll try and figure
something out of my own.

383
00:25:51,833 --> 00:25:54,433
And if it doesn't work out,
it can't be helped.

384
00:25:54,433 --> 00:25:56,134
I'll have to move out.

385
00:25:57,032 --> 00:26:00,634
Sun Young. It's okay.

386
00:26:00,634 --> 00:26:03,733
You don't have to feel ashamed
by feeling indebted to others.

387
00:26:03,733 --> 00:26:05,933
It's okay to feel that way.

388
00:26:07,634 --> 00:26:09,634
It's okay.

389
00:26:10,134 --> 00:26:12,233
I...

390
00:26:13,933 --> 00:26:16,032
I'm really okay.

391
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:17,634
I'll take care of it.

392
00:26:26,134 --> 00:26:27,333
Missus.

393
00:26:35,634 --> 00:26:41,833
Isn't life... and this world...
so unfair?

394
00:26:43,032 --> 00:26:50,634
Even though I borrowed money
here and there from you two...

395
00:26:50,634 --> 00:26:54,333
I've never taken out huge loans

396
00:26:54,333 --> 00:26:59,634
or been hugely indebted to others
all my life.

397
00:27:02,532 --> 00:27:05,134
And what about my Sun Woo?

398
00:27:05,134 --> 00:27:11,833
Geez... he hates seeing me suffer so
he doesn't want me doing dishes

399
00:27:11,833 --> 00:27:14,134
or doing other part time jobs.

400
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:17,022
And because of that

401
00:27:17,022 --> 00:27:23,357
he's never asked for brand name
goods his whole life.

402
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:26,333
Yeah. Where could you find
a better child than Sun Woo?

403
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:29,634
It's because you raised him so well.

404
00:27:30,532 --> 00:27:32,833
Even though I've lived like that...

405
00:27:32,833 --> 00:27:37,333
I've lived like that all my life...

406
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:40,833
but even so, it seems that
the three of us

407
00:27:40,833 --> 00:27:43,233
will be cast out into the streets
in this cold weather.

408
00:27:46,433 --> 00:27:48,134
Sun Young.

409
00:27:51,134 --> 00:27:58,134
Madam... is life so hard for just me?

410
00:27:58,134 --> 00:28:00,233
Huh?

411
00:28:00,233 --> 00:28:05,634
Why is mine so difficult?

412
00:28:29,634 --> 00:28:31,433
Mom, your son's home!

413
00:28:35,233 --> 00:28:37,233
You're here, my son?

414
00:28:37,733 --> 00:28:41,933
You're hungry, right? Wash up.
I bought some tangerines for you.

415
00:28:41,933 --> 00:28:43,833
Okay. What about Jin Joo?

416
00:28:43,833 --> 00:28:46,134
She's already asleep.

417
00:28:46,134 --> 00:28:48,433
Mom, you go to sleep first.
I'll go to sleep later.

418
00:28:48,433 --> 00:28:51,532
Is your wrist okay?
I told you to go to the doctor.

419
00:28:51,532 --> 00:28:53,933
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'll go.

420
00:28:53,933 --> 00:28:55,932
Geez... you always say you will,
but you don't...

421
00:28:55,932 --> 00:28:58,333
I'll really go!

422
00:28:58,333 --> 00:29:00,032
Stop worrying so much.

423
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:02,576
Should I bring you the tangerines
to your room?

424
00:29:02,576 --> 00:29:03,576
Yeah.

426
00:30:40,233 --> 00:30:41,233
Wow!

427
00:30:42,933 --> 00:30:44,634
Hey, Mr. Choi!

428
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:45,634
When did you get back?

429
00:30:45,634 --> 00:30:48,532
How about a drink this evening?

430
00:30:56,134 --> 00:30:57,933

Wow... it's already 6:00 p.m.
Tour of Duty is on, huh?

435
00:31:15,933 --> 00:31:19,032
How does time pass by so quickly
on Sundays?

436
00:31:19,833 --> 00:31:24,634
Um... I'm going out for a bit.
Have dinner and go to sleep early.

437
00:31:24,634 --> 00:31:26,634
You're going out to drink again,
aren't you?

438
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:29,433
Geez... the important thing
isn't the alcohol.

439
00:31:29,433 --> 00:31:33,532
Mr. Choi's friend abruptly passed away.

440
00:31:33,634 --> 00:31:37,833
So it's to console him,
not because I want to drink.

441
00:31:37,833 --> 00:31:39,933
Nice excuse you've got there.

442
00:31:39,933 --> 00:31:44,233
How do you manage to find
so many reasons to go drinking?

443
00:31:44,233 --> 00:31:46,333
Geez... that's a real talent
you've got there.

444
00:31:46,333 --> 00:31:51,933
Geez. I told you... today, it's really
all about consoling Mr. Choi.

445
00:31:51,933 --> 00:31:56,032
I'll just have one glass and come home.

446
00:31:56,032 --> 00:31:58,433
So have dinner
and go to sleep early.

447
00:32:00,233 --> 00:32:03,333
No Eul, help out your mother.

448
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:06,134
I'll bet he's so sad!

449
00:32:06,134 --> 00:32:07,134
Have a safe night.

450
00:32:07,134 --> 00:32:09,433
I'm sure he won't
even be in the right mind.

451
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:12,333
Geez!

452
00:32:20,532 --> 00:32:23,134

Mr. Choi!

457
00:32:43,317 --> 00:32:45,116
Mr. Choi!

458
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,718
What a close call.

459
00:33:01,218 --> 00:33:02,218
Geez...

460
00:33:02,218 --> 00:33:03,718
I was so shocked...

461
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:08,817
Even if you'd brought him 30 minutes
later, he would have become a vegetable.

462
00:33:08,817 --> 00:33:13,218
Oh my God... Is he okay now?

463
00:33:13,218 --> 00:33:15,718
Yes. Thankfully, you discovered him early

464
00:33:15,718 --> 00:33:17,817
so he doesn't have any
life-threatening conditions.

465
00:33:17,817 --> 00:33:20,417
He almost died.

466
00:33:20,417 --> 00:33:21,718
- Oh my...
- Oh my...

467
00:33:21,718 --> 00:33:27,018
Um... but a brain hemorrhage
surgery is a big deal.

468
00:33:27,018 --> 00:33:29,317
Did his surgery go well?

469
00:33:29,317 --> 00:33:32,718
He has high blood pressure,
so he should've been more careful.

470
00:33:32,718 --> 00:33:36,018
Even so, there wasn't too much
hemorrhaging, so the surgery ended well.

471
00:33:36,018 --> 00:33:38,417
- Oh, thank you so much.
- Thank you so much.

472
00:33:38,417 --> 00:33:40,116
He'll regain consciousness soon.

473
00:33:40,116 --> 00:33:44,616
We'll have to continue monitoring him,
but he'll be able to eat and talk soon.

474
00:33:44,616 --> 00:33:45,616
- Oh my...
- Oh my...

475
00:33:45,616 --> 00:33:46,718
His hands may tremble.

476
00:33:46,718 --> 00:33:51,518
This is a common symptom after brain
hemorrhages, so you don't need to worry.

477
00:33:51,518 --> 00:33:54,218
If he takes care of himself well,
it'll cease after time.

478
00:33:54,218 --> 00:33:55,317
- Yes.
- Yes.

479
00:33:55,317 --> 00:33:58,418
At any rate, you saved his life.

480
00:33:58,418 --> 00:34:03,117
It's very rare that a brain hemorrhage
patient is discovered so early.

481
00:34:03,117 --> 00:34:04,918
Oh... yes.

482
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:12,318
He's such a nice guy
so I guess he was blessed.

483
00:34:22,318 --> 00:34:26,217
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Yes.

484
00:34:26,217 --> 00:34:27,217
Then...

485
00:34:28,117 --> 00:34:30,418
Geez... what a relief.

486
00:34:34,018 --> 00:34:36,117
I feel so bad for him.

487
00:34:36,117 --> 00:34:39,717
He doesn't have a wife,
and I can't reach Taek...

488
00:34:39,717 --> 00:34:44,603
Hey, you heard what
he said, right?

489
00:34:44,603 --> 00:34:47,842
Alcohol saved his life!

490
00:34:49,717 --> 00:34:51,918
Oh, all right, already.

491
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:54,117
Can you call the Baduk Club
one more time?

492
00:35:05,518 --> 00:35:07,817
Oh!

493
00:35:07,817 --> 00:35:09,217
When are you going to the hospital?

494
00:35:09,217 --> 00:35:11,217
I was about to head out soon.
What's that?

495
00:35:11,217 --> 00:35:14,117
Oh, I made some rice porridge. I thought
anything else would be too much.

496
00:35:14,117 --> 00:35:16,217
He can eat starting today, right?

497
00:35:16,217 --> 00:35:18,416
Yes, he'll be allowed to eat
starting this evening.

498
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:19,617
Oh, really?

499
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:22,416
Then I'll have to grill him some croakers
when it's my turn.

500
00:35:22,416 --> 00:35:24,518
I'm sure fish would be better
than red meat.

501
00:35:24,518 --> 00:35:27,617
Wow, I'm sure he'll be so happy,
eating croakers!

502
00:35:27,617 --> 00:35:31,317
But... he didn't hire
a personal nurse, right?

503
00:35:31,317 --> 00:35:33,217
Probably not.

504
00:35:33,217 --> 00:35:36,817
I don't know what he's planning to do
with all the money he has.

505
00:35:36,817 --> 00:35:39,117
It'd be so convenient for him
to have a personal nurse.

506
00:35:39,117 --> 00:35:40,916
We can make him food,
but I'm sure

507
00:35:40,916 --> 00:35:43,518
it'd be really difficult for him
to use the bathroom and wash up.

508
00:35:43,518 --> 00:35:46,018
It's because he's always been alone.

509
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:49,416
I'm sure Taek will be in and out.
He takes good care of himself, so...

510
00:35:49,416 --> 00:35:50,617
you don't need to worry.

511
00:35:50,617 --> 00:35:52,617
Wow, looks delicious.

512
00:35:52,617 --> 00:35:54,317
- Wow, look at this.
- It's nothing much.

513
00:35:54,317 --> 00:35:55,817
Looks yummy.

514
00:36:05,416 --> 00:36:07,416
Geez...

515
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:20,418
Mr. Choi Moo Sung?
I'll be taking your blood pressure.

516
00:36:21,918 --> 00:36:24,818
Why are you sitting up?
I'm sure you're dizzy.

517
00:36:24,818 --> 00:36:27,418
Your guardian isn't here?

518
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:29,918
Your hands will be shaking a lot

519
00:36:29,918 --> 00:36:32,018
and you'll be very uncomfortable
for the time being.

520
00:36:32,018 --> 00:36:35,318
Oh, I do have one... my son.

521
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:38,117
Oh... the famous one?

522
00:36:38,117 --> 00:36:41,117
But... I heard he's very busy.

523
00:36:41,117 --> 00:36:43,717
The doctor told me that he
just met him today.

524
00:36:43,717 --> 00:36:45,436
Your father is a very lucky case.

525
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:47,516
When people usually pass out from
blood hemorrhages

526
00:36:47,516 --> 00:36:50,617
they're rendered paralyzed
or become aphasic

527
00:36:50,617 --> 00:36:52,818
but your father was
very quickly discovered

528
00:36:52,818 --> 00:36:55,717
so he'll have no time
re-assimilating into society.

529
00:36:57,717 --> 00:36:59,818
The surgery ended well, too.

530
00:36:59,818 --> 00:37:03,117
He'll be able to be discharged
after a week or so.

531
00:37:03,117 --> 00:37:04,918
Thank you.

532
00:37:04,918 --> 00:37:07,418
We've overcome a huge hurdle
so don't worry too much.

533
00:37:07,418 --> 00:37:09,817
All you have to do is take care
of him well from here on in.

534
00:37:09,817 --> 00:37:12,617
Yes. Thank you, doctor.

535
00:37:12,617 --> 00:37:15,918
Um, also...

536
00:37:20,617 --> 00:37:22,918
can I have your autograph?

537
00:37:22,918 --> 00:37:24,217
Oh... yes.

538
00:37:36,617 --> 00:37:38,617
I'm fine.

539
00:37:38,617 --> 00:37:40,117
Really.

540
00:37:40,117 --> 00:37:42,418
They said that you almost died.

541
00:37:43,918 --> 00:37:46,217
I almost became an orphan.

542
00:37:47,117 --> 00:37:52,318
I can't leave you behind so easily.

543
00:37:52,318 --> 00:37:53,518
Hey.

544
00:37:54,418 --> 00:37:59,318
Everything ended without a hitch, so
don't worry and focus on your own stuff.

545
00:38:00,617 --> 00:38:03,018
Get a personal nurse, Dad.

546
00:38:03,018 --> 00:38:06,518
Geez... my limbs are fine,
so why would I need one? No.

547
00:38:07,117 --> 00:38:08,617
I'm going to China this week.

548
00:38:08,617 --> 00:38:11,117
I won't be by your side, so
how will you manage on your own?

549
00:38:11,117 --> 00:38:14,518
Geez... the ladies come by once a day.

550
00:38:15,318 --> 00:38:19,717
I'm fine, so worry about
your own stuff. Okay?

551
00:38:21,617 --> 00:38:23,717
But... what do we do?

552
00:38:23,717 --> 00:38:25,717
I heard that Mr. Lee
from the Baduk Club

553
00:38:25,717 --> 00:38:27,617
won't be able to go
with you this time, either.

554
00:38:27,717 --> 00:38:31,217
Then I'll have to go to China with you.

555
00:38:31,217 --> 00:38:32,918
It's fine.

556
00:38:32,918 --> 00:38:37,717
The chief is coming with me.
And I'll be fine if I go alone.

557
00:38:37,717 --> 00:38:40,217
But even so, someone has to stick by you
and take care of you.

558
00:38:40,217 --> 00:38:43,918
Just worry about yourself.

559
00:38:45,117 --> 00:38:49,217
Mr. Guardian? We have to take care of
the subtotal for the hospital fees.

560
00:38:49,217 --> 00:38:50,217
Yes.

561
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:07,318
- Yes?
- Hey, you! I'm here!

562
00:39:07,318 --> 00:39:09,617
- The one who saved--
- Hurry up!

563
00:39:09,617 --> 00:39:10,818
Hello!

564
00:39:10,818 --> 00:39:12,617
Oh, you're here?

565
00:39:12,617 --> 00:39:14,617
Speaking of which,
are you feeling okay?

566
00:39:14,617 --> 00:39:17,018
Are your hands shaking a lot?

567
00:39:17,018 --> 00:39:19,418
- I've gotten a lot better.
- Oh.

568
00:39:19,418 --> 00:39:21,418
Ms. Mi Ran made you some rice porridge.

569
00:39:21,418 --> 00:39:22,918
Have some with some
doenjang soup.

570
00:39:22,918 --> 00:39:24,018
Oh, thank you.

571
00:39:24,018 --> 00:39:27,818
Oh yeah. If you want anything,
let me know.

572
00:39:27,818 --> 00:39:31,318
I'll bring it to you
on my way home from work.

573
00:39:32,518 --> 00:39:34,418
I do have one request.

574
00:39:36,117 --> 00:39:41,217
Since you've saved my life,
can I ask you for one more favor?

575
00:40:24,117 --> 00:40:26,418
But... why her?

576
00:40:26,918 --> 00:40:29,217
There's Jung Hwan and Sun Woo too.

577
00:40:32,617 --> 00:40:34,117
<i>Duk Seon?</i>

578
00:40:34,117 --> 00:40:36,318
Our second daughter?
Ms. 989th Place?

579
00:40:36,318 --> 00:40:37,918
You're talking about Duk Seon
right now?

580
00:40:37,918 --> 00:40:40,637
This time, Taek is going to China

581
00:40:40,637 --> 00:40:44,717
and I was wondering if
she could go with him.

582
00:40:44,717 --> 00:40:47,117
When he goes abroad for a competition

583
00:40:47,117 --> 00:40:50,418
Mr. Lee from the Baduk Club
or I always go with him

584
00:40:50,418 --> 00:40:53,617
but this time, neither of us can make it.

585
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:58,717
If someone doesn't take care of him,
he's like a corpse in his room.

586
00:40:58,717 --> 00:41:00,117
He doesn't come out at all.

587
00:41:00,117 --> 00:41:04,318
So... all she has to do is
make sure that he eats.

588
00:41:04,318 --> 00:41:08,418
Oh my. You must not be
in your right mind.

589
00:41:08,418 --> 00:41:10,918
That girl is a total idiot
who doesn't know anything.

590
00:41:10,918 --> 00:41:12,717
Duk Seon will do well.

591
00:41:12,717 --> 00:41:15,918
And Taek will be more comfortable
with her than with anyone else.

592
00:41:15,918 --> 00:41:19,418
But there's Jung Hwan
and Sun Woo, too.

593
00:41:19,418 --> 00:41:23,117
Those two will be seniors in high school
soon, so they have to study...

594
00:41:24,717 --> 00:41:25,717
Oh, no.

595
00:41:25,717 --> 00:41:30,318
That's not... what I meant
to say was... um...

596
00:41:30,318 --> 00:41:31,918
- that is...
- No, no, I get it.

597
00:41:31,918 --> 00:41:34,617
What you're saying is right.

598
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:39,617
The only kid on our block who
doesn't study is Duk Seon.

599
00:41:40,617 --> 00:41:42,217
No, that's not it.

600
00:41:42,217 --> 00:41:47,217
It seems that it takes a while
for guys to get their passports.

601
00:41:47,217 --> 00:41:49,117
They said that it takes
a couple of months.

602
00:41:49,117 --> 00:41:50,818
But Duk Seon is a girl

603
00:41:50,818 --> 00:41:54,918
so she can get one in a couple days
if the Baduk Club helps out.

604
00:41:59,418 --> 00:42:03,918
Oh... if it's difficult,
you don't need to send her.

605
00:42:03,918 --> 00:42:05,617
I just asked, just in case.

606
00:42:05,617 --> 00:42:11,818
No, it's nothing like that...
it's just because I feel bad for Taek.

607
00:42:11,818 --> 00:42:14,418
Taek's scary when he gets angry,
isn't he?

608
00:42:14,418 --> 00:42:18,617
No. Taek likes Duk Seon.

609
00:42:18,617 --> 00:42:21,418
I'm sure that the two of them
will get along fine.

610
00:42:26,318 --> 00:42:28,418
I'll bet Taek feels so ashamed.

611
00:42:28,418 --> 00:42:30,717
Who's taking care of who, exactly?

612
00:42:30,717 --> 00:42:33,617
Duk Seon.
Where did you get that suitcase?

613
00:42:33,617 --> 00:42:34,717
From Taek's room.

614
00:42:34,717 --> 00:42:35,717
What about the camera?

615
00:42:35,717 --> 00:42:37,117
It's Taek's.

616
00:42:37,117 --> 00:42:39,117
Thieving bitch.

617
00:42:39,117 --> 00:42:41,418
It's okay. He won't notice anyway.
He's an idiot.

618
00:42:45,918 --> 00:42:48,818
How can you call your older sister
a thieving bitch, you bastard?

00:42:52,918 --> 00:43:00,818
<i>[Guangzhou, China
TV Baduk Asia Championship Finals]</i>

620
00:43:10,617 --> 00:43:13,217
Wow... why all the luggage?

621
00:43:13,217 --> 00:43:14,818
Is this all yours, Miss?

622
00:43:15,818 --> 00:43:18,418
Oh, yes.
It's my first time abroad, so...

623
00:43:18,418 --> 00:43:20,418
I brought everything
just in case.

624
00:43:20,418 --> 00:43:21,418
Oh.

625
00:43:21,418 --> 00:43:23,918
You're friends with
Choi Taek, 6-dan?

626
00:43:23,918 --> 00:43:25,817
Yes. We're neighbors.
We're childhood friends.

627
00:43:25,817 --> 00:43:32,117
Oh... Master Choi has such
a cute friend. I'm jealous.

628
00:43:32,918 --> 00:43:34,518
Are you his girlfriend?

629
00:43:34,518 --> 00:43:36,617
Excuse me?
What are you saying?

630
00:43:36,617 --> 00:43:37,818
We're just friends.

631
00:43:37,818 --> 00:43:40,918
But, um... are you from
the Baduk Club too, Mister?

632
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:42,418
Do you play Baduk too?

633
00:43:42,418 --> 00:43:44,117
These two are reporters.

634
00:43:44,117 --> 00:43:45,117
Oh.

635
00:43:45,617 --> 00:43:47,717
Wow... as to be expected,
your cameras are awesome!

636
00:43:47,717 --> 00:43:50,918
This guy here is a newbie too.

637
00:43:50,918 --> 00:43:52,918
It's his first time abroad.

638
00:43:52,918 --> 00:43:56,818
It's the first time abroad
for you too, right, Mr. Yoo?

639
00:43:56,818 --> 00:43:58,717
I've been to Japan once or twice before.

640
00:43:58,717 --> 00:44:00,617
Here are your room keys.

641
00:44:00,617 --> 00:44:02,217
This concludes
your check-in process.

642
00:44:02,217 --> 00:44:03,418
Oh, thank you.

643
00:44:05,418 --> 00:44:07,617
We all can use the same room.

644
00:44:08,117 --> 00:44:10,717
This one is for Ms. Duk Seon... room 403.

645
00:44:10,717 --> 00:44:12,617
And this one is for Master Choi...
room 405.

646
00:44:12,617 --> 00:44:15,516
I asked them to give you two rooms
that are right across from each other

647
00:44:15,516 --> 00:44:17,117
so it'll be easy to go back and forth.

648
00:44:17,117 --> 00:44:20,318
Also, this is a spare key
for Master Choi's room.

649
00:44:20,318 --> 00:44:22,117
Hold onto this, Duk Seon.

650
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:26,617
He passed out in his room one time,
so keep it just in case.

651
00:44:27,217 --> 00:44:29,117
Ah... yes.

652
00:44:42,217 --> 00:44:44,617
This is your room key. Room 405.

653
00:44:44,617 --> 00:44:45,918
Okay.

654
00:44:45,918 --> 00:44:48,518
We've decided to have dinner
at this hotel's Chinese restaurant.

655
00:44:48,518 --> 00:44:50,418
You just need to come
to the lobby by 6:00 p.m.

656
00:44:51,518 --> 00:44:55,117
I'll head up first. I'll go on ahead.

657
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:59,117
I'll come get you by 5:55 p.m.

658
00:45:01,018 --> 00:45:02,617
He won't come.

659
00:45:02,617 --> 00:45:04,918
He doesn't eat before matches.

660
00:45:04,918 --> 00:45:08,318
And during competitions in China,
he really doesn't eat much.

661
00:45:08,318 --> 00:45:11,117
He can't digest well, and the food
doesn't really suit his palate.

662
00:45:11,117 --> 00:45:13,818
He's a bit sensitive before matches.

663
00:45:13,818 --> 00:45:16,617
Mister, um...

664
00:45:16,617 --> 00:45:19,818
do they have tangsooyook
(Korean-Chinese fusion dish) here?

665
00:45:24,318 --> 00:45:25,717
I bet it'll be delicious.

666
00:45:26,918 --> 00:45:28,418
Yeah. Sure.

667
00:45:33,717 --> 00:45:36,418
Wow... what the heck?

668
00:45:36,418 --> 00:45:38,018
Can I eat all of this?

669
00:45:38,018 --> 00:45:39,418
Yeah. Hurry and sit.

670
00:45:39,418 --> 00:45:40,418
Yes!

671
00:45:42,818 --> 00:45:43,818
How's Master Choi?

672
00:45:43,818 --> 00:45:45,217
He says he'll eat later.

673
00:45:46,018 --> 00:45:47,717
I knew this would happen.

674
00:45:47,717 --> 00:45:50,818
Even so, he would've acted like
he were eating if his father were here.

675
00:45:55,018 --> 00:45:57,018
Is this place famous?

676
00:45:57,018 --> 00:45:58,518
They make great food here.

677
00:45:58,518 --> 00:46:01,318
This city is near the sea,
so they make great fish dishes.

678
00:46:02,117 --> 00:46:03,918
What other restaurants
have good food?

679
00:46:04,918 --> 00:46:08,018
I heard that there's a famous
Japanese place around here.

680
00:46:08,018 --> 00:46:10,617
Oh... the place across the street?

I'm worried that she's going
to cause trouble.

small incidents.

in acting like that.

I couldn't sleep all night, either.

all night.

I'm sure she must have been
even more uncomfortable, as a girl.

are like that.

Geez... I'll bet that Master Choi
won't be in such good condition.

This is Jae Il Real Estate, right?

858
01:02:31,329 --> 01:02:36,030
Um... are there any cheap places?

859
01:02:36,030 --> 01:02:38,530

860

Oh... you don't have any cheaper ones?

861
01:02:46,030 --> 01:02:51,030

- Yes.

866
01:03:02,730 --> 01:03:04,931
She slipped on the stairs.

867
01:03:04,931 --> 01:03:09,030
She has to take care of both men today
so can you go today?

868
01:03:09,030 --> 01:03:11,431
We'll feed Sun Woo and Jin Joo.

869

Okay. The youngest
should deliver, after all.

870

You know, I got a call from
Mr. Choi this morning, anyway

871
01:03:16,829 --> 01:03:18,730
asking for shampoo and conditioner.

872
01:03:18,730 --> 01:03:21,630
Wow... come to think of it, it's
time for him to wash his hair, isn't it?

873
01:03:21,630 --> 01:03:23,931
He hasn't washed his hair once
since his surgery, right?

874
01:03:23,931 --> 01:03:26,230
I bet his hair is really
oily and matted by now.

875
01:03:26,230 --> 01:03:28,431
Isn't it usually like that anyway?

876
01:03:28,431 --> 01:03:30,829
That's his usual style.

877
01:04:34,730 --> 01:04:36,730

878
01:05:07,329 --> 01:05:11,931
Oh yeah. Doesn't Taek have a match today?
Did he win?

879
01:05:13,230 --> 01:05:15,329
I haven't heard from him yet.

880
01:05:23,829 --> 01:05:25,329
Thank you.

881
01:05:27,931 --> 01:05:30,230
He's going to break his record
at this rate.

882
01:05:30,829 --> 01:05:35,931
Mister, how could a person
sit still for 10 hours?

883
01:05:35,931 --> 01:05:37,431
Is he human?

884
01:05:37,431 --> 01:05:40,030
I'll bet he doesn't even know
that 10 hours have gone by.

885
01:05:40,431 --> 01:05:42,030
Wow.

No, he won.

889
01:06:13,030 --> 01:06:14,829
What? Why's his expression
like that, then?

890
01:06:14,829 --> 01:06:16,230
He's confusing me.

891
01:06:16,230 --> 01:06:17,269
It's Baduk Etiquette.

892

What?

893
01:06:18,931 --> 01:06:21,130
Oh... even if they win,
they have to be humble

894
01:06:21,130 --> 01:06:23,230
and have to be polite
even if they lose.

that sells goldfish bread.

01:19:03,730 --> 01:19:08,029
Why didn't you tell me?

1030
01:19:11,230 --> 01:19:13,029
My older brother told you, didn't he?

1031
01:19:13,029 --> 01:19:15,930
Girl. We see each other
every day...

1032
01:19:15,930 --> 01:19:19,430
and yet, I had to hear about that
from Tae Yong?

1033
01:19:21,029 --> 01:19:24,029
Oh yeah... Moo Sung.

1034
01:19:24,029 --> 01:19:25,029
Yeah?

1035
01:19:25,029 --> 01:19:28,131
You haven't heard, right?

1036
01:19:28,131 --> 01:19:30,029
What are you talking about?

1037
01:19:30,029 --> 01:19:33,131
She didn't tell you, it seems.

1038
01:19:33,131 --> 01:19:36,029
About what? Huh?

1039
01:19:37,329 --> 01:19:40,029
My younger sister... Sun Young.

1040
01:19:40,930 --> 01:19:42,430
Why? What happened?

1041
01:19:45,930 --> 01:19:49,730
I was going to tell you but
she told me that she'd tell you herself

1042
01:19:49,730 --> 01:19:51,730
and asked me not to tell you.

1043
01:19:51,730 --> 01:19:54,329
It's that...

1044
01:20:08,730 --> 01:20:13,730
Moo Sung.
It's because this is so humiliating.

1045
01:20:13,730 --> 01:20:18,029
Girl... what are you embarrassed about?
I'm like your older brother!

1046
01:20:19,230 --> 01:20:23,829
I'm not embarrassed
at the state I'm in at all.

1047
01:20:27,930 --> 01:20:29,529
Sun Young.

1048
01:20:29,529 --> 01:20:35,829
In life, sometimes you become indebted to
others or inconvenience others.

1049
01:20:35,829 --> 01:20:37,230
It happens.

1050
01:20:37,230 --> 01:20:39,529
Everyone lives like that.

1051
01:20:40,730 --> 01:20:44,230
Don't suffer too much on your own.

1052
01:20:46,631 --> 01:20:54,230
I only wanted you to see me
living a good life.

1053
01:20:54,230 --> 01:20:55,430
What kind of nonsense--

1054
01:20:56,029 --> 01:20:58,029
You're living a perfectly good life!

1055
01:20:58,029 --> 01:21:00,730
How could one live a better life
than yours?

1056
01:21:01,730 --> 01:21:05,529
You raised Sun Woo and Jin Joo so well.

1057
01:21:06,230 --> 01:21:08,930
Even that's an incredible feat in itself.

1058
01:21:08,930 --> 01:21:12,730
You're running your household well,
and you've raised your children well.

1059
01:21:12,730 --> 01:21:18,430
And... you take such good care of
your older friend from your hometown.

1060
01:21:24,131 --> 01:21:28,529
If you hadn't called me to Seoul
at that time, Sun Young...

1061
01:21:28,529 --> 01:21:33,829
I would have still been drinking every
day, unable to forget Taek's mom.

1062
01:21:36,930 --> 01:21:42,029
Thanks for calling me here.

1063
01:21:42,631 --> 01:21:44,529
That's nothing worth thanking me for.

1064
01:21:49,829 --> 01:21:50,930
Oh geez.

01:22:00,829 --> 01:22:03,230
Why would I go to Seoul?

1070
01:22:04,529 --> 01:22:07,230
I'm just going to stay here.

1071
01:22:07,230 --> 01:22:08,829

1072
01:22:08,829 --> 01:22:13,631

to forget about Min Joo, who passed away!</i>

1073
01:22:13,631 --> 01:22:16,029

to grow up in Seoul.</i>

1074
01:22:16,029 --> 01:22:18,029
<i>Come move to our neighborhood.</i>

1075
01:22:18,029 --> 01:22:20,430
Seoul is no place for a person to live.

1076
01:22:20,430 --> 01:22:22,730
I can't live in a place like that.

1077
01:22:22,730 --> 01:22:26,029
Moo Sung, it's even more rural
here than in Gimhae.

1078
01:22:26,029 --> 01:22:28,829
Everyone here is so nice.
Hurry up and move up here.

1079
01:22:28,829 --> 01:22:31,230
You have to live your own life!

1080
01:22:31,230 --> 01:22:33,730
How long will you cling on to
Min Joo?

1081
01:22:49,829 --> 01:22:51,529
Are you Taek?

1082
01:22:53,230 --> 01:22:54,730
You are, right?

1083
01:22:58,029 --> 01:23:04,529
Wow... you're so pretty looking!
You don't look like your dad at all.

1084
01:23:04,529 --> 01:23:06,631
The heavens really
helped you out with that one.

Come on!
Let's go.

01:23:16,829 --> 01:23:21,029
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!

1088
01:23:25,029 --> 01:23:31,029
<i>The best thing I ever did
was moving to Seoul.</i>

1089
01:23:31,029 --> 01:23:37,230
This time, too... if not for the people
in the neighborhood, I'd already be dead.

1090
01:23:37,230 --> 01:23:39,719
I'm indebted to a lot of people
and have inconvenienced people

1091
01:23:39,719 --> 01:23:41,230
and I do feel sorry
about that, but...

1092
01:23:41,230 --> 01:23:43,331
but I'm not going to worry
too much about it anymore.

1093
01:23:43,331 --> 01:23:47,131
It's not like I'll ever forget
their kindness toward me.

1094
01:23:48,029 --> 01:23:52,029
So don't try to do everything
on your own, either.

1095
01:23:52,029 --> 01:23:54,230
Who cares if you're indebted
to other people?

1096
01:24:09,230 --> 01:24:12,230
Here you go. 10 million.

1097
01:24:16,829 --> 01:24:19,529
Take it. My arm hurts.

1098
01:24:21,131 --> 01:24:26,529
No... Moo Sung... I won't accept this.

1099
01:24:26,529 --> 01:24:29,029
Girl, have you heard anything
that I just said?

1100
01:24:29,029 --> 01:24:31,329
Hurry up and take it!

1101
01:24:36,430 --> 01:24:41,029
I'm not giving this to you.
I'm lending it to you. Okay?

1102
01:24:41,029 --> 01:24:43,131
You can pay me back later.

1103
01:24:43,131 --> 01:24:44,430
Take it!

1104
01:24:56,230 --> 01:25:00,230
And this... is something
I'm just giving you.

1105
01:25:00,230 --> 01:25:04,230
Get your wrist fixed while
I'm still saying it nicely.

1106
01:25:04,230 --> 01:25:07,329
I've made all the arrangements.

1107
01:25:07,329 --> 01:25:11,829
When you come to the hospital,
go to the first floor to take care of it

1108
01:25:11,829 --> 01:25:13,829
and you can come whenever you want.

1109
01:25:13,829 --> 01:25:16,829
You'd better go. All right?

1110
01:25:20,829 --> 01:25:24,930
When Tae Yong came by,
he didn't worry about me one bit

1111
01:25:24,930 --> 01:25:29,230
and just worried about you
the whole time.

1112
01:25:29,930 --> 01:25:36,230
Stop making him worry and be indebted
to people when you need to be.

1113
01:25:36,230 --> 01:25:40,730
All right? And when you're
having a hard time, say so.

1114
01:25:40,730 --> 01:25:43,230
Don't live life in such a difficult way.

1115
01:25:45,230 --> 01:25:46,930
Have some goldfish bread.

1116
01:25:49,029 --> 01:25:50,329
Here.

1117
01:25:58,029 --> 01:26:04,430
Speaking of which...
just how many did you buy?

1118
01:26:04,430 --> 01:26:06,529
How many is this?

1119
01:26:06,529 --> 01:26:07,930
We can finish them all if we try.

1120
01:26:07,930 --> 01:26:11,930
Geez. You're even greedier
than you were before.

1121
01:26:11,930 --> 01:26:13,329
I'm going to eat them all!

1122
01:26:13,329 --> 01:26:14,829
I can take some home too.

1123
01:26:15,529 --> 01:26:17,829
Are Gangnam's goldfish breads
any different?

1124
01:26:18,631 --> 01:26:20,829
How many is this, really?

1125
01:26:22,730 --> 01:26:24,829
I couldn't help myself.

1126
01:26:28,829 --> 01:26:30,829
- I...
- Yeah.

1127
01:26:30,829 --> 01:26:32,230

- Photo?

1128
01:26:32,230 --> 01:26:33,230
Yes.

1129
01:26:33,230 --> 01:26:35,029
- With him.
- Oh, with Taek?

1130
01:26:35,029 --> 01:26:37,229
- Yeah. Photo.
- Geez... of course I can do that much.

1131
01:26:37,229 --> 01:26:39,730
Duk Seon. Let's go upstairs.

1132
01:26:39,730 --> 01:26:42,430
Taek. Jang Pyo wants to take
a photo with you.

1133
01:26:43,230 --> 01:26:45,730
- Okay.
- His name is Jang Pyo?

1134
01:26:45,730 --> 01:26:47,430
I guess you two are friends now.

1135
01:26:47,430 --> 01:26:49,829
Yes. We became friendly
while we were arguing.

1136
01:26:54,829 --> 01:26:57,230
Hey. Smile a bit.

1137
01:26:57,230 --> 01:26:59,329
Okay.

1138
01:26:59,329 --> 01:27:03,730
One, two, three!

1139
01:27:05,730 --> 01:27:07,029
Thank you.

1140
01:27:08,829 --> 01:27:10,329
Thank you.

1141
01:27:10,730 --> 01:27:13,730
Why don't you two stand together?
I'll take a photo for you.

1142
01:27:13,730 --> 01:27:14,730
Us?

1143
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:16,730
Go stand there.
It's fine.

1144
01:27:16,730 --> 01:27:18,631
Go! It's fine!

1145
01:27:18,631 --> 01:27:20,430
His photos are really like masterpieces.

1146
01:27:20,430 --> 01:27:23,029
- Hurry. Go and stand together.
- Go, go, go.

1147
01:27:26,230 --> 01:27:29,029
Damn it... I don't look pretty today.

1148
01:27:29,930 --> 01:27:32,430
- You look pretty.
- Really?

1149
01:27:32,430 --> 01:27:35,329
Yeah. Your clothes
are pretty, too.

1150
01:27:35,329 --> 01:27:38,029
These clothes look okay?

1151
01:27:38,029 --> 01:27:39,131
Yeah.

1152
01:27:39,730 --> 01:27:41,430
It's your clothes.

01:27:43,230 --> 01:27:44,329
Oh.

1154
01:27:47,631 --> 01:27:50,930
Okay... I'm taking it now!

1155
01:27:52,230 --> 01:27:58,029

Hmm... January, 1989.

Wow. You remember
the most peculiar things, huh?

1163

This was the best day
of your life, right?

01:28:30,029 --> 01:28:31,829
Right?

1165
01:28:33,730 --> 01:28:38,631
How could you remember something
that happened 30 years ago so well?

1166
01:28:38,631 --> 01:28:43,131
I guess people come to remember
everything when they get older?

1167
01:28:45,631 --> 01:28:47,329
Are you getting senile?

1168
01:28:48,829 --> 01:28:51,230
The date is written right there
on the bottom.

1169
01:28:54,430 --> 01:28:55,829
You're embarrassed, right?

1170
01:28:55,829 --> 01:28:57,829
I bet you are.

1171
01:28:57,829 --> 01:28:58,930
Want some water?

1172
01:28:58,930 --> 01:29:01,829
No thanks. Choke some down yourself.

Bo Ra. Are you okay?

1174
01:30:49,430 --> 01:30:51,730
There are no more buses tonight,

18 years old. Why all of the sudden?

1192
01:32:18,131 --> 01:32:20,230
I've been watching you
for eighteen years.

1193
01:32:20,230 --> 01:32:23,930
Have I ever gotten angry at you
in those eighteen years?

1194
01:32:25,029 --> 01:32:29,529
I've bitched out all the other kids,
but I don't think I ever did to you.

You're kind, righteous, and smart.

1199
01:32:47,930 --> 01:32:50,430
I do like you, as a person.

1200
01:32:51,329 --> 01:32:57,829
Can't we just go back
to the way we were before?

1201
01:33:00,730 --> 01:33:03,230
I don't want to not have
a relationship with you at all.

1202
01:33:03,230 --> 01:33:05,329
You understand what I'm saying, right?

1203
01:33:11,230 --> 01:33:13,029
I don't want to.

1204
01:33:16,029 --> 01:33:18,529
I hate having this type of
relationship with you.

1205
01:33:18,529 --> 01:33:20,829
It has no meaning to me.

1206
01:33:30,730 --> 01:33:33,329
<i>[Lee Sun Hee]</i>

1207
01:33:36,730 --> 01:33:39,029
Let's go to the concert together.

1208
01:33:45,829 --> 01:33:50,430
Not as friends, but as a man and a woman.

1209
01:34:02,631 --> 01:34:07,329
<i>A line indicates a limit,
saying, "That's as far as you get."</i>

1210
01:34:08,029 --> 01:34:13,730
<i>To maintain that boundary means to
maintain the same familiarity...</i>

1211
01:34:13,730 --> 01:34:15,653
<i>and it means that one
will respect the universe</i>

1212
01:34:15,653 --> 01:34:17,501
<i>that it outlines through
abiding by its rules</i>

1213
01:34:17,501 --> 01:34:19,954
<i>and maintaining the relationships
existing in it as they are.</i>

1214
01:34:20,730 --> 01:34:23,730
<i>This also means that, if one were to
never cross that line, one would never</i>

1215
01:34:23,730 --> 01:34:27,329
<i>experience the world, rules,
and relationships</i>

1216
01:34:27,329 --> 01:34:30,529
<i>outside of the currently
established boundaries.</i>

1217
01:34:37,730 --> 01:34:42,029
<i>If one wishes for a new relationship...
if one wishes for love...</i>

1218
01:34:42,029 --> 01:34:44,131
<i>one must cross the line.</i>

1219
01:34:46,829 --> 01:34:48,829
<i>If one were to not cross the line</i>

1220
01:34:48,829 --> 01:34:53,029
<i>that line would demarcate the limit
of how far you and that person can go.</i>

1221
01:35:10,230 --> 01:35:15,829
<i>Of course, there are some lines in
this world that should never be crossed.</i>

1222
01:35:41,430 --> 01:35:42,829
Um...

1223
01:35:47,829 --> 01:35:49,529
you are him... right?

1224
01:35:51,730 --> 01:35:52,829
You are.

1225
01:36:09,430 --> 01:36:11,829
That person...

1226
01:36:11,829 --> 01:36:12,829
that person!

1227
01:36:12,829 --> 01:36:14,730
It's him!

1228
01:36:15,029 --> 01:36:16,930
Chun Doo Hwan!
(Controversial Korean president)

1229
01:36:17,730 --> 01:36:19,829
It's you!

01:36:33,329 --> 01:36:35,730
<i>Throw these out, already!</i>

1232
01:36:35,730 --> 01:36:38,730
<i>Bring all of those, as they are,
back inside.</i>

1233
01:36:41,329 --> 01:36:44,829
<i>How fascinating. What's the reason?</i>

1234
01:36:44,829 --> 01:36:48,230
<i>I don't know. He doesn't know.
I don't know. Nobody knows.</i>

1235
01:36:48,230 --> 01:36:51,829
<i>But, um... I haven't seen Jung Bong
all day. Do you know where he went?</i>

1236
01:36:51,829 --> 01:36:54,329
- Hey, punk!
- Stop right there!

1237
01:36:54,329 --> 01:36:56,829
<i>Okay, don't go anywhere.</i>

1238
01:36:56,829 --> 01:36:58,529
<i>He's really not the type of kid
to do that.</i>

1239
01:36:58,529 --> 01:37:00,829
<i>You're so annoying!</i>

1240
01:37:06,430 --> 01:37:08,529
<i>Don't concern yourself over me.</i>

1241
01:37:10,631 --> 01:37:14,131
<i>How do you know you might not
meet the man you're fated for?</i>

1242
01:37:14,131 --> 01:37:17,230
<i>Hey. I'm a guy.
Am I a girl, then?</i>

1243
01:37:20,930 --> 01:37:22,529
<i>I have something to
talk to you about.</i>

1244
01:37:22,529 --> 01:37:23,730
<i>With me?</i>

1245
01:37:23,730 --> 01:37:26,230
<i>Excuse me!
You have to go in now.</i>

1246
01:37:26,230 --> 01:37:28,131
<i>Yes, just a moment.</i>

1247
01:37:29,430 --> 01:37:31,329
<i>[Can't go.]</i>

1248
01:37:31,329 --> 01:37:33,029
<i>What do I do if he
really does like me?</i>

1249
01:37:34,029 --> 01:37:36,329
<i>You two really do suit each other.
Do your best.</i>

1250
01:37:38,029 --> 01:37:39,631
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

1251
01:37:39,631 --> 01:37:42,029
<i>I have something to ask you.</i>

1252
01:37:42,029 --> 01:37:44,329
<i>Hey, you know...</i>
