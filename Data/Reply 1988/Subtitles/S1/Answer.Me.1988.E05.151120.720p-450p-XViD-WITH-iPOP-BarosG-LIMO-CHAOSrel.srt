Other places are even worse off!

31

Between here and Jongro,
protesters are everywhere!

32
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,780
At any rate, it'll be difficult to
get the tear gas out of my suit...

She's not home yet?

35

Sung Bo Ra is quite
a busy individual nowadays.

36

Yes... that's right.

37
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,840
I guess she's really preoccupied
with studying nowadays.

38
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,340
Well, it's only to be expected,
since she's a college student.

39

eaten yet, right?

so that you could go around protesting?

53

Bo Ra, hurry up and say you're sorry!

54

Even though her father is
getting so worked up over it

80

she won't even think of apologizing.

81

talked back to him. Geez.

with her dad.

Isn't the eldest daughter usually
close to her dad?

84

No, they are close!

85

It just seems that way,
but that's not the case.

86
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,820
That girl, Bo Ra, is the problem!
Her father isn't the issue!

or has any cute traits about her.

88

You can say that again.
She's really not a normal kid.

94
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:22,540
I don't want much. I'll just be satisfied
if she didn't get kicked out of school.

I wonder if there will ever come a day
that I can have tons of these stacked up.

170
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:09,430
What are you saying? Up until
three years ago, I had to use firewood.

171
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,930
That's right.

172
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:13,430
Wow... you did have a time when
you were once poor, didn't you?

173
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:15,130
It hasn't been long,
but I forgot already.

174
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:18,430
- Oh yeah. Don't make dinner tonight.
- Why not?

175
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:21,430
I made abalone porridge. I heard
that Sun Woo hurt his leg.

176
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:24,430
Why did you go through the trouble
of making that?

177
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:28,430
Then, can I just have a little bit?
I'm expecting a guest tonight.

178
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,930
- Who?
- The kids' grandmother.

179
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,430
What? Why is that
nasty bitch coming?

180
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,430
How much is she planning
to upset you this time?

181
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:40,430
It's not like she's coming to see me.
She's coming to see the kids.

182
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:43,430
It doesn't even affect me anymore.

183
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:47,010
She treated you so badly after
her son died!

184
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:51,430
She said that you devoured
her precious son alive!

185
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:55,430
She didn't watch any of her words
and said so many crude things to you!

186
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:56,930
Is she nobility or something?

187
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:59,930
It's not like you owe her money
or something. Geez.

188
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:02,630
Geez... when I think of that day,
I get so angry.

189
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,430
Is she the only one
who ever lost her son?

190
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,330
She has no consideration
for her daughter-in-law

191
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:07,730
who became a widow at a young age!

192
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:10,330
She's the one who cut ties with you,
calling you an unlucky bitch.

193
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:13,930
So why the hell is she coming
to see you, now? Pisses me off.

194
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:17,930
It's fine! Why are you
getting so worked up?

195
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:20,430
It's frustrating to me as a bystander!

196
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:23,430
Geez... and you can't even say
a single thing to her, like an idiot.

197
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:24,930
Geez! So frustrating!

198
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:26,930
What good would it do
if I did say something?

199
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:30,930
It will just wear my jaw out.
It doesn't affect me anymore.

200
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:32,930
I'm going to think of her as a stranger.

201
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:36,430
But... is this what you're going to wear?

202
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,930
What's wrong with what I'm wearing?

203
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,930
You don't have any new clothes?

204
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:42,430
It's fine! Appearances
aren't important.

205
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,730
I don't feel embarrassed at all,
even looking like this.

206
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:46,930
I'm really not going to care anymore.

207
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:50,430
- Put this on.
- Can I?

208
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:51,430
Oh, how nice.

209
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:54,430
- Wait, it doesn't suit you.
- Stop it! I'm wearing it!

210
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,430
All right, then.

211
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:01,430
Sun Woo. If there's anything
you need, call me right away.

212
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:04,430
- Okay?
- Yes. Goodbye.

213
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,930
- You're out of rice?
- I'm going to buy some today.

214
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:43,430
- You should have--
- I'll take care of it.

215
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:47,930
Why is Sun Woo so skinny?

216
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:50,930
Compared to last time,
he's skin and bones.

217
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:52,930
You don't care about your children?

218
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:57,930
Also, you... you only have
those clothes to wear?

219
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:03,930
Look at you. So grim. Pathetic.

220
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:06,930
I'm sure any incoming luck would go
running at the sight of you. Geez.

221
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:11,430
And why is it so chilly in here? You
don't have any charcoal briquettes?

222
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:14,430
What if the kids catch a cold?

223
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:19,430
Geez! What exactly do you
do around the house?

224
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:22,430
Do you bring any money home,
or go to work?

225
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:24,930
After swallowing my son whole...

226
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:28,930
you receive my son's pension
and live in my house

227
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:31,930
and you can't even raise the kids right?

228
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:34,430
We're getting along just fine.

229
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:36,430
And I'm raising my son
just fine, too.

230
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:38,430
Don't worry about it.

231
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:42,430
How could I not,
when you're living in this state?

232
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,930
Are you doing this to spite me?

233
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:48,430
You want to show me just how much
of an unlucky bitch you are?

234
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:49,430
Huh?

235
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,430
What did he ever see in you?

236
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:57,930
What a terrible fate.

237
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:04,430
What crime did I commit in my past life
to be associated with you?

238
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,430
Geez.

239
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:09,430
Why do you have to say things like that?

240
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:15,430
You know...

241
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,930
I'm my mother's precious daughter, too.

242
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:23,930
If my mother knew I was subjected
to this kind of talk from someone

243
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:26,430
I'm sure she'd cry tears of blood.

244
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:31,430
At the very least,
for my mother's sake...

245
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:33,930
I won't sit by and listen to you
talk to me like that anymore.

246
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:36,430
Mother-in-Law.

247
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:39,430
Don't ever come here again.

248
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:47,430
Even if I have to shave my head, I'll do
whatever it takes to raise my kids well.

249
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:51,930
Even if I can't buy them
brand-name shoes

250
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:57,430
I won't let them starve
and will buy them pretty clothes

251
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:01,430
and will live a life that
nobody would consider shameful.

252
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:09,430
So... Mother-in-Law... Don't
ever come back here again!

253
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,930
Don't ever come back here

254
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:15,930
so that the three
of us can live in peace!

255
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:19,930
I won't ever agree to see you again.

256
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:23,930
Even if you come to see us,
I won't open the door!

257
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,430
You got that?

258
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:43,430
Buy the kids some clothes with this.

259
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:45,930
It's fine.

260
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:47,430
Did anyone say that this is for you?

261
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:48,930
I'm giving it to my little ones.

262
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:58,500
How dare she... geez!

263
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:01,930
I don't need it.

264
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:04,930
I'll clothe my own kids.
Goodbye.

265
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:55,930
I feel so much better.

266
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:58,930
What a load off my chest.

267
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:02,930
Sun Woo! Eat this before you go to sleep.

268
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:23,930
Jung Hwan's mother
made abalone porridge for you...

269
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:50,430
Geez. Stop sweeping
the street, already!

270
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:53,930
- Is it because you're lonely?
- Hello.

271
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:58,130
Hello. Oh yeah. Is Taek home?
Did he come back yesterday?

272
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:00,630
Yes. He came home yesterday.

273
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:05,430
- Dad, the hot water doesn't work.
- What?

274
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:09,430
- Hello.
- Yes, hello.

275
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,930
Taek. You haven't had
breakfast yet, right?

276
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:12,930
No.

277
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:15,930
I made some abalone porridge,
so come and take some.

278
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:18,930
- I've put some aside for you.
- Thank you.

279
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:29,930
- You have a microwave at home, right?
- Yes.

280
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:32,620
Just keep it in the refrigerator.
Put some in a separate container

281
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,930
when you want to eat it and
heat it up with the microwave.

282
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:37,930
You have small bowls at home, right?
Not glass ones, but ceramic.

283
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:41,430
Put about two ladle’s worth
in a soup bowl, and...

284
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:47,430
It's fine. I'll call your dad.

285
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:51,430
- Go ahead. - Yes. Goodbye.

286
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:55,930
What brings you here
so early in the morning?

287
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:57,930
- Did you get home last night?
- Yeah.

288
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:01,430
- You didn't go to school today?
- Hey, today's Sunday.

289
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:04,930
- Oh.
- Geez... I'm so jealous of you, bastard.

290
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:07,430
Jung Hwan. Go buy one square of tofu.

291
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:09,430
Okay. Let's go.

292
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:10,930
- Thank you!
- Okay!

293
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:24,930
- Open your eyes, Special Unit.
- Oh... it's Taek. Hi, Taek.

294
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:28,430
Oh, hi. Did you not get any sleep?

295
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:29,430
Yeah.

296
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:32,430
Duk Seon!

297
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:44,430
- When did you get back, Taek?
- Last night.

298
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:46,430
What brings you here,
when you've hurt your leg?

299
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:51,430
Oh... Duk Seon, can I borrow
your Korean-English dictionary?

300
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:53,930
Mine? You came to borrow mine?
With that leg?

301
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:55,630
You don't have
a Korean-English dictionary?

302
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:58,400
Yeah... I don't.

303
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:03,430
Is that right? Well, yeah.

304
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:04,930
Hers is completely new.

305
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:07,830
It's better to borrow it from her instead
of spending money on a new one.

306
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:08,930
Shut it.

307
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:10,930
Is your leg okay?

308
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:13,430
I just stretched a ligament. I'm fine.

309
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:15,430
Wait here, Sun Woo. I'll bring it.

310
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,930
No, it's fine. I can walk that much.

311
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:20,430
- Hey, hey.
- Geez!

312
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:22,430
I'm fine!

313
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:27,430
I'm fine.

314
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:30,430
No, no... other side. Yeah.

315
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:34,930
I'm fine. I'm fine.

316
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:37,930
I'm fine! Hey, watch the stairs.

317
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:58,930
Um... Mother.

318
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:02,430
The room is cold...
did the briquettes go out?

319
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:04,430
Your father put it out
early this morning.

320
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:08,430
I re-ignited it not too long ago so just
wait a bit. Jung Bong, pass me a dish.

321
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:19,430
Go back to your room.

322
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:26,430
Honey. The toilet's
clogged again.

323
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:27,930
Set the table.

324
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:28,930
Okay.

325
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:36,430
- Lower the volume!
- Okay. Mom, did you see the newspaper?

326
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:40,930
Geez... ow! Mother!

327
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:45,430
What? I'm bleeding!

328
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:47,430
Where?

329
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:56,930
Where? Hmm?

330
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:59,930
Honey, the steamed egg is overflowing.
Come quickly!

331
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:00,930
Turn off the flame then!

332
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:03,930
- Mom, this is yesterday's paper.
- I turned the flame off!

333
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:06,930
- Ow!
- It's still overflowing!

334
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:07,930
Hurry over here! Quick!

335
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:08,930
Ow!

336
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:11,930

Where's today's paper?

Geez... I ought to...

341
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:37,430
Oh my. Did the sun rise
from the west today?

It's the first time I've seen

Duk Seon awake early enough to
eat breakfast on a Sunday!

345
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:47,430
Dad. I go to the
study room nowadays.

346
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:49,330
I have to head straight there
after breakfast.

347
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:54,930
Wow. I guess this daughter of
mine is studying now, after all!

348
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:58,430
How long have you been going there?
You never even told me!

349
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:01,930
Today's her first day. She
hasn't even gone once yet.

350
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:05,830
Don't you know that getting started
is half the battle?

351
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:10,430
Thank you for the meal! I'm
going to hurry over there now.

352
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:19,930
Dad. You didn't know that Duk Seon
has a chronic illness, right?

353
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:23,430
A chronic illness? What
do you mean by that?

354
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:25,430

she's been suffering from it.

been sleeping this whole time?

Where is she?

364
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:09,930
She went to school. She has finals
starting tomorrow.

365
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:12,930
She said that she wants to get a good
spot in the library, and left early.

366
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:16,430
What if she went out early
to go to another protest?

367
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:18,930
No! Why can't you trust people?

368
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:21,430
It's true. She took a bunch

Wow.

How great would it be if
Lee Mi Yeon was my older sister?

375
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:52,430
How is she so different from Duk Seon,
when they're the same age?

Hey. That girl is the
same age as Duk Seon?

377
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:59,930
Yeah. She's 18, just like Duk Seon.

378
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:04,430
Someone looks like that
while others... ugh.

379
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:07,930
Hey, you bastard.
What's wrong with our Duk Seon?

380
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:11,430
In my eyes, Duk Seon is so much prettier!

381
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:14,930
Yeah. I agree.

Hello? Hi, Mi Sook.

389
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:26,430
Why did she go up to the mountains again?

390
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:28,430
It's not like chestnuts
are even worth much.

391
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:33,430
Okay. I'll come. Why isn't she going
to the hospital?

392
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:37,430
Just wait. I'll take her.
Okay... bye.

393
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:45,430
- Your grandmother sprained her ankle.
- Is she badly hurt?

394
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:49,430
I don't know. She won't go to the
hospital, so I have to go see her.

395
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:53,430
Let's go together. It's been a while
since I've seen my in-laws.

396
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:56,030
Stay here, honey. Are you going
to let the kids starve to death?

397
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:03,930
Okay. I'm going to be away
for two days.

398
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:07,430
If you want to live, heed my words.
Got it?

399
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:24,430
Underwear goes here. Undershirts go here.
Socks go here. Got it?

400
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:27,930
Here.

401
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:30,430
- The briquette has gone out.
- What do you do?

402
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:34,930
- Use a mini-briquette.
- Correct!

403
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:38,930
Look here.

404
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:41,130
What do you do when
the briquettes are stuck together?

405
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:44,430
- Kitchen knife.
- That's right!

406
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,930
This is beef. You just have to
saute this in the frying pan.

407
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:05,430
These greens are going to go bad,
so have them for lunch and dinner.

408
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:08,430
As for the salad and the black beans,
put them in smaller bowls.

409
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:09,430
Got it?

410
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:12,930
I have a question.
Can't we just order in?

411
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:16,930
Cook, damn you! I even made all
of the side dishes already!

412
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:24,930
Make sure you check the gas.

413
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:27,730
Make sure the water in the toilet
goes down all the way, or it'll clog.

414
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:29,630

by today, okay?

- Okay, okay!

418
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:36,930
Hurry up and go!
I'm sure your mother is waiting!

419

Oh yeah, Jung Hwan.

uniform and put them in your room...

up and leave this block, already.

00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:23,630
What the hell did you say?
Get the hell back here!

500
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:25,630
Honey!

501
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:29,630
Heed my words. All right?

502
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,630
If anyone even gives her a glass of water

503
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:35,630
I'm going to flip
the whole house upside down!

504
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:40,630
Don't you dare give a damn whether
or not she dies. Any of you.

505
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:42,630
- Got it?
- Okay.

506
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:45,240
Don't give her anything.

507
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:49,130
Don't you dare.

508
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:57,630
<i>That damned girl.
We sacrificed so much for her.</i>

509
00:42:57,630 --> 00:43:02,130
<i>Even though we scrimped and saved
when it came to our own things</i>

510
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:07,130
<i>we never hesitated to give her the best.</i>

511
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:08,630
<i>I wanted to treat her</i>

512
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:12,130
<i>like the smart and precious child
that we told everyone she was!</i>

513
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:15,630
<i>We poured so much into her...
that ungrateful wench!</i>

514
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:21,130
<i>She's aware of all that, and yet she has
the gall to do this to her parents?</i>

515
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:22,710
<i>Huh?</i>

516
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:35,130
I heard that all of her upperclassmen
were captured already.

517
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:37,130
What if they take Bo Ra
away, too?

518
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:39,630
What if she gets a criminal record?

519
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:43,630
If so, then all of Korea's college
students will have criminal records.

520
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:46,630
Don't worry.

521
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:47,920
And even if she
does get arrested

522
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,730
she just has to write a letter of
reflection to be released right away.

523
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:52,130
What's that?

524
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:56,130
Geez... it's basically a document
saying that you're sorry.

525
00:43:56,130 --> 00:43:58,130
It's this thing you write
to formally apologize.

526
00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:00,330
If she just writes that,
she'll be released right away.

527
00:44:00,330 --> 00:44:05,630
Damn it! She's done for! My older
sister is Sung Bo Ra, okay?

528
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:07,630
She'll never say that
what she did was wrong.

529
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:11,630
- You know how she is.
- All too well.

530
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:15,630
But you said that she made it home.
Then she'll be fine.

531
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:19,630
- Oh, you're here?
- Yeah.

532
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:22,130
What are you two doing
by yourselves?

533
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:26,130
- What?
- What are you two doing?

534
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:28,630
What do you mean, bastard?
We're just conversing here.

535
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:30,630
You know, talking. Talking.

536
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:32,630
What's with you? I'm leaving.

537
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:37,630
- Where are you going?
- To the study room.

538
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:38,630
What?

539
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:40,830
Apparently, she's been
going to the study room lately.

540
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:44,630
Hey, do you know what time it is?
The sun set already.

541
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:46,130
I'll be back before 12:00 a.m.

542
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:47,630
I'm someone who has willpower, too.

543
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:50,630
Hey, even though your face
can be considered a lethal weapon

544
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:52,630
walking around past midnight
is dangerous.

545
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:53,630
Just give up on college.

546
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:55,130
Like me.

547
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:57,130
The study room is right there.

548
00:44:57,130 --> 00:44:59,630
I'll be back before 12:00 a.m.
Bye!

549
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:01,630
Bye, friend!

550
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:11,630
Yes, this is Master Choi Taek's home.

551
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:13,130
Yes.

552
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:14,630
Yes.

553
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:16,130
Yes.

554
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:21,130
Who was that?

555
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:22,130
Kyu Won?

556
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:23,630
Your dad.

557
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:24,630
Huh?

558
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:27,430
He says he's hungry, so he wants you
to hurry over and make him dinner.

559
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:53,630
What the hell is this?

560
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:57,630
My younger brother.

561
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:18,130
Grandfather once said,
"All things expand and shrink."

562
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:20,630
If you have hot water on the bottom
and cold water on the top

563
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:24,630
the two different temperatures work
together in harmony to do this.

564
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:26,730
We can make them come apart like this.

565
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:32,130
My son.

566
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:40,130
Shall your father lend you a hand?

567
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:51,630
Dad, this is burning!

568
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:40,130
Wow.

569
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:06,630
It's cold over there.
Come over here and sleep.

570
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:08,630
Don't you worry whether I die or not.

571
00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:12,630
What if she leaves in the
middle of the night while I'm sleeping?

572
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:15,130
I'm going to guard this door
no matter what

573
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:17,130
so go ahead and sleep, honey.

574
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:20,630
Speaking of which,
Duk Seon still isn't home?

575
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:24,130
It's almost midnight!
She should come home earlier!

576
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:26,630
Did she fall asleep?

577
00:50:06,130 --> 00:50:07,630
<i>I'm home!</i>

578
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:10,130
<i>Hi, honey. Come home earlier.</i>

579
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:11,630
<i>Okay.</i>

580
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:25,130
<i>- Sun Woo! Breakfast!
- Okay!</i>

581
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:31,130
Mom, we're eating in here?

582
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:32,830
It's okay. We can eat in the living room.

583
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:34,630
It's warmer in here. So nice.

584
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:37,130
Let's eat in here.

585
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:52,130
- Mom, why aren't you eating?
- Hmm? I will.

586
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:56,130
We don't have a lot of side dishes.

587
00:50:56,130 --> 00:50:59,130
I should make you some meat dishes...

588
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:02,130
Oh... it's fine! I don't even
like meat that much.

589
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:08,630
It's delicious.

590
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:11,630
Who is that? It's so early.

591
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:14,130
Yes?

592
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:16,630
Mom! What is it?

593
00:51:18,130 --> 00:51:19,130
What?

594
00:51:19,130 --> 00:51:20,630
Is he badly hurt?

595
00:51:21,130 --> 00:51:25,130
He was probably not watching his
step, as usual... which hospital?

596
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:31,130
You don't need to! I can
take care of him! Geez, Mom.

597
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:34,130
You have to hurry up
and get Tae Soo married, already!

598
00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:37,630
What?

599
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:42,400
You're... coming to my house right now?
You're at the terminal?

600
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:44,660
You're getting off in Seoul now, Mom?

601
00:51:45,630 --> 00:51:47,630
<i>I have some things to give you</i>

602
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:51,630
<i>and I wanted to see Sun Woo and Jin
Joo so I'll be dropping by for a bit.</i>

603
00:51:51,630 --> 00:51:55,130
<i>It'll only take me 30 minutes
to get there by bus.</i>

604
00:51:55,130 --> 00:51:57,130
<i>You don't need to come and pick me up!</i>

605
00:51:57,130 --> 00:51:59,130
<i>I'll take a taxi and I'll be right there.</i>

606
00:51:59,130 --> 00:52:03,630
<i>I'll just drop by for a bit and just have
a glass of water before I go.</i>

607
00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:06,130
<i>You don't need to worry. Not one bit.</i>

608
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:07,630
<i>See you soon!</i>

609
00:52:20,630 --> 00:52:23,130
You're not going to work today, Dad?

610
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:24,630
He's taking the day off.

611
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:27,130
He's doing it to make sure Bo Ra
doesn't escape.

612
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:30,630
Even so, we should feed her, at least.
She didn't even have dinner last night.

613
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:32,630
I told you, no!

614
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:37,630
Until she gets on her knees
and apologizes, I'm not budging.

615
00:52:37,630 --> 00:52:42,130
I worked so hard to send her to a good
college and this is how she repays me.

616
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:44,130
She won't come to her senses
unless she starves.

617
00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:48,490
Don't you dare sneak her anything.
Got it?

618
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:04,630
Dad. The briquettes went out.

619
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:12,130
No they didn't. I just changed it
early this morning.

620
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:15,130
It's way too cold.

621
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:22,630
The fire's fine.

622
00:53:22,630 --> 00:53:24,130
What could be the issue?

623
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:28,630
Grandfather once said this.

624
00:53:28,630 --> 00:53:31,130
There are two different types of
briquette boilers.

625
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:34,130
The type that uses the briquette
as a direct source of heat

626
00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:37,630
and the type that uses briquettes to
heat water, which in turn heats rooms.

627
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:39,330
The type that our home uses
is the latter.

628
00:53:39,330 --> 00:53:42,130
If the briquette is fine
but the room is still cold...

629
00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:44,130
in that instance, the issue lies with...

630
00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:50,130
this.

631
00:53:51,130 --> 00:53:55,130
The possibility that this tank has
run out of water is close to 100 percent.

632
00:53:55,130 --> 00:53:56,630
- Oh.
- Ah.

633
00:54:02,130 --> 00:54:07,630
Jung Hwan. What's for breakfast today?

634
00:54:07,630 --> 00:54:11,130
Oh. It's your favorite.

635
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:15,630
Is it, perhaps... ramyun?

636
00:54:15,630 --> 00:54:17,630
I need something to put this on!
Hurry!

637
00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:29,130
Aw, yeah! What about Dad?

638
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:31,130
Dad!
Have breakfast!

639
00:54:37,630 --> 00:54:41,130
Children. The toilet
is clogged again.

640
00:54:43,630 --> 00:54:46,130
Oh geez. I just lost my appetite.

641
00:54:46,130 --> 00:54:48,130
I tried using the plunger,
but it wouldn't work.

642
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:54,630
Grandfather once said this.

643
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:58,130
If the floor is full of feces,
you have to lower the pressure.

644
00:54:58,130 --> 00:55:01,130
I have a good feeling about this one.

645
00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:04,630
Stop spouting bullcrap
and do something about this.

646
00:55:29,130 --> 00:55:31,130
Then, I'll leave the rest to you.

647
00:55:31,130 --> 00:55:32,130
Thornton.

648
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:45,630
Sun Woo! Your grandmother is coming!
It's an emergency!

649
00:55:45,630 --> 00:55:48,630
Change into something else
and clear the table! Don't eat!

650
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:55,630
Here, this one. Wash your face first!

651
00:55:55,630 --> 00:55:57,130
I have to go to school, though.

652
00:55:57,130 --> 00:55:58,130
Oh... yeah.

653
00:56:32,630 --> 00:56:36,630
I'll use only a little
and give this right back!

654
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:52,630
These, too!

655
00:57:24,130 --> 00:57:27,130
Jung Bong! Can you help me?

656
00:57:31,130 --> 00:57:35,130
Oh... oh geez.

657
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:04,130
Oh my God, you scared me!

658
00:58:05,630 --> 00:58:07,130
It is finished.

659
00:58:15,130 --> 00:58:19,630
Jung Bong, thanks so much. I'll
put everything back later.

660
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:21,130
You can take your time with that.

661
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:24,630
Wow... I think this is
pretty much perfect now.

662
00:58:25,630 --> 00:58:27,230
I won't be caught at this rate, right?

663
00:58:33,130 --> 00:58:38,130
These are sesame seeds,
and these are senna seeds.

664
00:58:38,130 --> 00:58:39,830
Make it into tea and give it to Sun Woo.

665
00:58:39,830 --> 00:58:41,630
I heard it's good for one's health.

666
00:58:41,630 --> 00:58:46,130
Mom. They sell this stuff in Seoul, too.
Why did you bring it here?

667
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:47,130
Oh, geez.

668
00:58:47,130 --> 00:58:48,630
- Mom, also...
- Yes?

669
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:50,130
Eat something before you go.

670
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:53,130
I called Tae Soo and he seems fine.

671
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:56,130
Things like that happen
when you're a cab driver.

672
00:58:56,130 --> 00:58:58,130
You can take your time
heading over there.

673
00:58:58,130 --> 00:59:01,130
No. I have to hurry
and go there.

674
00:59:17,630 --> 00:59:20,630
Jin Joo!
Granny's going now!

675
00:59:20,630 --> 00:59:21,630
Already?

676
00:59:23,130 --> 00:59:26,630
Mom, it hasn't even been 10 minutes
since you got here! Stay a bit longer!

677
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:29,230
Oh, geez... what good would it do
for me to stay here any longer?

678
00:59:39,130 --> 00:59:40,130
Oh my.

679
00:59:40,130 --> 00:59:42,630
I'm just getting more worried about you.

680
00:59:42,630 --> 00:59:45,630
Don't come outside to see me off.
I'm leaving now.

681
00:59:45,630 --> 00:59:49,130
Mom! You should stay a bit longer!

682
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:54,630
Geez! You really don't listen!

683
00:59:55,630 --> 01:00:00,130
Where's your bathroom? I kept
drinking so much juice, so...

684
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:01,840
Over there.

685
01:00:22,130 --> 01:00:24,130
I told you, go back inside!

686
01:00:24,130 --> 01:00:26,130
You're in such a hurry!

687
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:32,130
- Oh, hello, Sun Woo's grandmother!
- Yes! How are you?

688
01:00:32,130 --> 01:00:34,630
- You're doing well, right?
- Yes.

689
01:00:34,630 --> 01:00:37,130
You're already leaving, ma'am?

690
01:00:37,130 --> 01:00:42,130
My son hurt his leg, so I have to
go see him at the hospital.

691
01:00:42,130 --> 01:00:45,130
Then... I'm off!

692
01:00:45,130 --> 01:00:46,630
I'm leaving now!

693
01:00:46,630 --> 01:00:48,130
Have a safe trip home, ma'am!

694
01:00:48,130 --> 01:00:49,630
- Thank you!
- Bye, Mom.

695
01:00:51,130 --> 01:00:54,630
She came here for the first time in a
while, but didn't even stay the night?

696
01:00:55,130 --> 01:00:57,130
She came here because
of your brother's leg injury?

697
01:00:57,130 --> 01:01:00,130
- Is he badly hurt?
- I don't think so.

698
01:01:00,130 --> 01:01:02,130
She probably just came to
see how I was doing.

699
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:07,130
She was probably curious
about my living situation.

700
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:10,630
She worries that
I don't eat properly and such.

701
01:01:10,630 --> 01:01:12,630
She thinks that I'm not aware of that.

702
01:01:12,630 --> 01:01:13,630
Is that right?

703
01:01:14,130 --> 01:01:19,130
Madam. Look at me. I've been doing all
sorts of crazy things since this morning!

704
01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:21,130
But I didn't get caught!

705
01:01:22,630 --> 01:01:28,130
- Oh yeah. Is Bo Ra okay?
- No, she's not okay.

706
01:01:28,130 --> 01:01:31,230
Her father didn't even go to work today
because he's watching her like a hawk.

707
01:01:31,630 --> 01:01:36,630
Geez! She didn't even have anything
to eat... I'm so worried about her!

708
01:01:44,630 --> 01:01:49,130
- Eat.
- Oh... put it here.

709
01:01:53,130 --> 01:01:56,130
Oh my. That's all the side
dishes you have for me?

710
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:58,130
Yep. Just eat.

711
01:01:58,630 --> 01:02:02,630
You should have made me
a fried egg, at least.

712
01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:06,130
We don't have any eggs!

713
01:02:06,130 --> 01:02:10,130
Anyway... what about you?
You're not eating with me?

714
01:02:10,630 --> 01:02:16,630
You think that I could eat at a
time like this? How inhumane.

715
01:02:25,630 --> 01:02:26,630
- Oh!
- Oh!

716
01:02:26,630 --> 01:02:27,630
Bo Ra's mother!

717
01:02:27,630 --> 01:02:30,130
What are you doing outside
on such a chilly day?

718
01:02:30,130 --> 01:02:33,130
Geez... my heart feels so heavy,
so...

719
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:35,330
Jung Bong's mother hasn't come back yet?

720
01:02:35,330 --> 01:02:37,130
No. She's coming back tomorrow.

721
01:02:37,130 --> 01:02:39,130
I guess it's a vacation
for the guys at your place.

722
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:41,130
The house is a mess, right?

723
01:02:41,130 --> 01:02:44,130
No, that's not true.
We're getting by so well.

724
01:02:44,130 --> 01:02:47,630
It's just that we don't do housework...
but when we do, we're good at it.

725
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:48,630
I see.

726
01:02:49,130 --> 01:02:53,130
You should put some socks
on, at least. Geez.

727
01:02:57,130 --> 01:02:59,630
- You made alcohol out of ginseng?
- Yes!

728
01:02:59,630 --> 01:03:02,130
When else could I drink it,
except when my wife is gone?

729
01:03:02,130 --> 01:03:05,130
- My husband is home today, too.
- Oh, really?

730
01:03:05,130 --> 01:03:09,130
- Then we can have a drink together!
- Yes!

731
01:03:26,130 --> 01:03:32,130
There's no use in
getting your kids educated.

732
01:03:32,130 --> 01:03:37,130
Even if you get them to study hard,
they act like they're hot shit

733
01:03:37,130 --> 01:03:40,130
and do whatever they want.

734
01:03:40,630 --> 01:03:47,630
Even so... I wish Jung Bong
could be half of what Bo Ra is.

735
01:03:49,630 --> 01:03:56,630
He's my child, but... this kid...
I'm so worried about him.

736
01:03:58,130 --> 01:04:04,130
Because my wife and I had
a soft spot for him

737
01:04:04,130 --> 01:04:07,130
we just let him do as he wished, but...

738
01:04:08,630 --> 01:04:11,630
I'm really worried about him.

739
01:04:14,130 --> 01:04:17,130
Speaking of which...
is Bo Ra okay?

740
01:04:22,130 --> 01:04:23,130
I'm not eating.

741
01:04:24,130 --> 01:04:28,130
Eat already!
Are you planning to starve to death?

742
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:30,130
I'm not hungry and I have no appetite.

743
01:04:32,630 --> 01:04:34,130
Just have one spoonful.

744
01:04:34,130 --> 01:04:36,130
Just have one spoonful  and sleep.

745
01:04:36,130 --> 01:04:39,630
I made your favorite. Just have one bite.

746
01:04:40,130 --> 01:04:45,130
I told you, I'm not eating!
Leave me alone!

747
01:04:45,130 --> 01:04:51,130
Just one spoonful, Bo Ra!
Okay? Just one.

748
01:04:56,630 --> 01:05:03,130
Then... I'll leave it here. So eat it
later whenever you want to. Okay?

749
01:05:03,130 --> 01:05:08,130
If you don't want to eat now,
eat later, at least. Got it?

750
01:05:37,630 --> 01:05:42,630
Jin Joo! Oh, geez.
I have to wash that again!

751
01:05:43,130 --> 01:05:45,130
Seriously...

752
01:05:50,630 --> 01:05:52,630
Okay. Your arms.

753
01:05:55,130 --> 01:05:58,130
- Whose daughter is my little Jin Joo?
- Mommy's daughter!

754
01:05:59,130 --> 01:06:04,630
Oh, my child! Jin Joo, what do you want
to eat? What should we eat?

755
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:06,130
Banana.

756
01:06:06,130 --> 01:06:08,630
Banana? You had that yesterday
too, though.

757
01:06:08,630 --> 01:06:10,130
Banana!

758
01:06:11,130 --> 01:06:16,630
Okay. I'll go buy some later.
Go to your room. Good girl!

759
01:06:49,030 --> 01:06:52,530
<i>To my kind and beautiful daughter</i>

760
01:06:54,630 --> 01:07:00,130
<i>I don't have much money,
so I couldn't put in a lot.</i>

761
01:07:00,130 --> 01:07:03,630
<i>Buy some pretty clothes
for yourself, my daughter.</i>

762
01:07:04,130 --> 01:07:08,130
<i>My daughter, whom I love so much...
don't live life with your head hung low.</i>

763
01:07:08,630 --> 01:07:14,130
<i>You've done nothing wrong!
Make sure to take care of your health!</i>

764
01:07:53,130 --> 01:07:55,130
Geez. Mom... really...

765
01:08:19,630 --> 01:08:21,630
When did she leave that?

766
01:08:25,630 --> 01:08:27,130
I can't believe her.

767
01:08:52,630 --> 01:08:54,630
Honey, your laundry...

768
01:08:57,630 --> 01:09:00,130
Oh geez. Way to go.

769
01:09:20,030 --> 01:09:23,530
Sun Woo's mother. Have you see Bo Ra?

770
01:09:23,530 --> 01:09:28,530
No, I haven't seen her.
Why, she's not home?

771
01:09:28,530 --> 01:09:32,230
Oh geez... where did that girl go?

772
01:09:34,030 --> 01:09:36,530
No, I haven't seen her.
She didn't come by here.

773
01:09:37,530 --> 01:09:38,530
Okay.

774
01:09:41,030 --> 01:09:45,530
Taek's father. Did you see Bo Ra?
Did she pass by here?

775
01:09:45,530 --> 01:09:47,030
No, I didn't see her.

776
01:09:48,030 --> 01:09:51,530
- Oh my... what do I do?
- Ma'am!

777
01:09:53,030 --> 01:09:55,030
- Here.
- Thank you.

778
01:10:45,530 --> 01:10:47,530
Sung Bo Ra. That's you, right?

779
01:10:48,030 --> 01:10:50,030
Freshman, Math Education major
at Seoul University.

780
01:10:50,030 --> 01:10:51,530
You're student Sung Bo Ra, right?

781
01:10:53,530 --> 01:10:56,030
You know Ko Heung, right?

782
01:10:56,030 --> 01:11:00,530
Student body president
at Seoul University.

783
01:11:00,530 --> 01:11:02,530
He's your leader, isn't he?

784
01:11:07,030 --> 01:11:11,530
Did you participate in the protest
at Garak-dong or not?

785
01:11:13,030 --> 01:11:15,530
No, I didn't. I didn't do it.

786
01:11:15,530 --> 01:11:17,030
Look at this bastard.

787
01:11:17,030 --> 01:11:19,530
Cooperate and come with us
while we're still being civil.

788
01:11:20,030 --> 01:11:21,530
Bo Ra!

789
01:11:30,530 --> 01:11:34,530
Bo Ra. My daughter isn't the one
you're looking for.

790
01:11:34,530 --> 01:11:36,030
You can't take her away.

791
01:11:36,530 --> 01:11:39,030
Um... Madam... Do you know
what kind of daughter she is?

792
01:11:39,030 --> 01:11:41,530
She's the smartest kid
in the entire neighborhood.

793
01:11:41,530 --> 01:11:45,030
She's even smarter than
the kids from rich families!

794
01:11:45,030 --> 01:11:47,160
She could have went to Seoul
University's law school

795
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:52,030
but she wanted to get a scholarship
to she settled for the Education major.

796
01:11:52,030 --> 01:11:55,030
Her dream since she was young
was to be a prosecutor or a judge

797
01:11:55,030 --> 01:12:02,530
but she didn't want to burden
her parents financially, and settled.

798
01:12:02,530 --> 01:12:03,930
You know Seoul University, right?

799
01:12:03,930 --> 01:12:06,730
It's the university that only accepts
the smartest kids in our country!

800
01:12:06,730 --> 01:12:10,530
She was never tutored or went to a cram
school, but she got in on her first try!

801
01:12:10,530 --> 01:12:13,530
That's the type of daughter
that my daughter is.

802
01:12:14,030 --> 01:12:16,530
Do you know how many days
our neighborhood celebrated?

803
01:12:16,530 --> 01:12:20,530
Even her father's company
sent flowers as a congratulatory gift.

804
01:12:20,530 --> 01:12:23,530
Also, when she was graduating
high school...

805
01:12:23,530 --> 01:12:28,030
she got an award from the principal
as the student representative!

806
01:12:28,030 --> 01:12:31,030
She also made the top ten when it
came to her Suneung (Korean SAT) scores!

807
01:12:31,030 --> 01:12:33,130
Her uncle is a provincial governor

808
01:12:33,150 --> 01:12:36,530
and she's close enough with
him to have dinner with him!

809
01:12:36,530 --> 01:12:39,530
and one of her cousins
is going to medical school now!

810
01:12:39,530 --> 01:12:42,530
Also, also... do you know
about her father?

811
01:12:43,030 --> 01:12:45,530
He worked so hard for 20 years

812
01:12:45,530 --> 01:12:47,830
that he received an award
from the president of the bank!

813
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:51,530
He even had dinner with her, and wow...

814
01:12:51,530 --> 01:12:55,030
he said that there couldn't be a smarter
or kinder daughter in the world.

815
01:12:55,030 --> 01:12:57,530
The president even gave her
some spending money!

816
01:12:57,530 --> 01:13:01,530
And he even drove her all the way home
in his personal car!

817
01:13:01,530 --> 01:13:04,030
I'm sorry! I'm sorry
for what I did.

818
01:13:04,030 --> 01:13:06,530
Bo Ra! Don't say such nonsense!

819
01:13:06,530 --> 01:13:08,470
- What I did was wrong!
- No, no, no!

820
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:12,530
My child would never do that!
My daughter isn't that kind of child!

821
01:13:12,530 --> 01:13:15,030
I said, what I did was wrong!
I'll go to the police station.

822
01:13:15,030 --> 01:13:19,530
No, Bo Ra! You did nothing wrong!
My child isn't that kind of child!

823
01:13:19,530 --> 01:13:21,530
- Let's go.
- No.

824
01:13:21,530 --> 01:13:22,530
Let's go.

825
01:13:22,530 --> 01:13:24,330
I told you, my daughter
would never do that!

826
01:13:24,330 --> 01:13:27,530
- Please let go, ma'am.
- Let go! Let go!

827
01:13:28,030 --> 01:13:29,530
My child isn't that kind of child!

828
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:32,530
<i>Sometimes, I felt like my mom
was an embarrassment.</i>

829
01:13:33,530 --> 01:13:36,530
<i>There were time I couldn't understand
why she seemed to have</i>

830
01:13:36,530 --> 01:13:39,530
<i>self-consciousness or a sense of pride
and got angry.</i>

831
01:13:40,530 --> 01:13:46,330
<i>I didn't realize it then, but it was
because there was something precious</i>

832

- Of course.

868
01:17:19,530 --> 01:17:21,030

869
01:17:21,030 --> 01:17:25,530
Sit her down and give her a scary look
and strike fear into her heart!

870
01:17:27,530 --> 01:17:32,530
Geez. Why should I do that? It's
not like she committed a crime.

871
01:17:32,530 --> 01:17:38,530
How could I make her
get on her knees and yell at her?

872
01:18:23,030 --> 01:18:24,530
Banana.

873
01:18:31,030 --> 01:18:34,030
Okay. The biggest one is for Jin Joo.

874
01:18:34,530 --> 01:18:37,530
And, this one is for Mom!

875
01:18:37,530 --> 01:18:39,030
No, it's okay.
I'm not going to eat.

876
01:18:39,030 --> 01:18:40,030
You eat it.

877
01:18:40,030 --> 01:18:42,030
Geez... then, I won't eat it either.

878
01:18:42,030 --> 01:18:43,030
Let's throw it out.

879
01:18:43,030 --> 01:18:45,030
Okay, okay! I'll eat it!

880
01:18:48,030 --> 01:18:50,030
Is it yummy, Jin Joo?

881
01:18:55,030 --> 01:18:56,530
I'm home!

882
01:18:59,030 --> 01:19:00,530
What should we do about dinner?

883
01:19:02,530 --> 01:19:03,530
What about Dad?

884
01:19:04,530 --> 01:19:06,030
Yeah. What about dinner?

885
01:19:06,030 --> 01:19:08,030
I'm hungry. Okay. Hurry over.

886
01:19:08,030 --> 01:19:10,260
I used all the leftover side
dishes to make fried rice.

887
01:19:10,260 --> 01:19:11,360
I put dumplings in it, too.

888

891
01:19:29,030 --> 01:19:31,030
She said she just arrived
at the terminal.

892
01:19:36,030 --> 01:19:37,030

893
01:19:37,030 --> 01:19:39,030

Hurry up and clean!

894
01:19:51,030 --> 01:19:53,530
When did anyone play badminton?

895
01:20:44,030 --> 01:20:45,530
What about the charcoal briquettes?

896
01:20:45,530 --> 01:20:47,030
You didn't let it go out?

897
01:20:47,030 --> 01:20:49,530
Of course we didn't.
It's nice and warm.

898
01:20:53,530 --> 01:20:54,930
What about laundry? It's raining.

899
01:20:54,930 --> 01:20:57,230
You forgot to get the laundry
from the clothesline, right?

900
01:20:57,230 --> 01:21:00,530
We collected it all. Jung Bong collected
them, folded them, and put them all away.

901
01:21:01,030 --> 01:21:09,030
Honey. See? I told you we'd be fine. We
were totally fine without you here!!

902
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:12,480
Don't you worry about us! Okay?

903
01:21:17,030 --> 01:21:18,130
Aren't you hungry?

904
01:21:18,130 --> 01:21:21,030
I made the dumpling soup that you like.

905
01:21:21,030 --> 01:21:23,030
I'm fine. You have some.

906
01:21:38,030 --> 01:21:42,530
Since it's raining and all,
want to have some soju?

907
01:21:42,530 --> 01:21:44,530
It's time to go to sleep... what soju?

908
01:21:44,530 --> 01:21:46,030
Drink by yourself.

909
01:21:46,030 --> 01:21:48,030
Should I make some kimchi pancakes
for you, then?

910
01:21:48,030 --> 01:21:50,530
It's fine! Go and watch TV.

911
01:21:58,030 --> 01:22:01,030
Why? Why do I feel uneasy?

912
01:22:01,030 --> 01:22:03,530
I guess something at home is a mess.

913
01:22:03,530 --> 01:22:05,530
No way. We cleaned everything.

914
01:22:05,530 --> 01:22:07,830
We cleaned, did the laundry,
and did the dishes perfectly.

915
01:22:07,830 --> 01:22:09,230
We even changed all the briquettes

916
01:22:09,230 --> 01:22:11,130
and ate all the side dishes
she told us to eat.

917
01:22:11,130 --> 01:22:14,030
I'm sure my mom was shocked, too. She
doesn't even have to lift a finger.

918
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:16,030

01:22:16,030 --> 01:22:18,030

Geez... geez, geez, geez!

932
01:23:41,030 --> 01:23:44,030

No.

946
01:24:24,530 --> 01:24:27,250
It's because the family
is doing way too well.

947
01:24:29,530 --> 01:24:33,030
