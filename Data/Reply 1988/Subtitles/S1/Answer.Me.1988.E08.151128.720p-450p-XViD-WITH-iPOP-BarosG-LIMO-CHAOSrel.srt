<i>[December 1988]

3
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:21,930
Oh!

4
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:24,330
Mr. Choi!

5
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,630
Where did you get such pretty gloves?

6
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,330
Wow... did a lady friend
get them for you?

7
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:32,430
I'm not crazy, right?
Those are actually pink, right?

8
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,930
Where did you get those gloves?

9
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:38,430
Taek gave them to me
as my birthday gift.

10
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:44,030
Wow... our Taek is so cool.

11
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:45,130
Wow!

12
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:47,830
He bought his dad such pretty pink ones!

13
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:52,630
<i>Here's the weather.</i>

14
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:55,530
<i>A cold front is taking
over the entire country.</i>

15
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:00,330
<i>The middle region of Korea will be
around negative ten degrees Celsius</i>

16
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:04,830
<i>and in the Seoul region, it will go up to
about negative two degrees Celsius.</i>

<i>[Episode 8: One Warm Remark]</i>

18
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,030
Do you two think that I'm an idiot?

19
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,230
No.

20
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:41,030
This time, it's for real.

21
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,030
Hey.

22
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,630
Isn't it obvious?

23
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,030
He's totally crazy about you!

24
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,030
Of course he is.
Hey.

25
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,430
Why else would he come all the way

26
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,630
to the McDonald's in Apgujung
from Ssangmundong?

27
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,730
He totally likes you!

28
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,930
Congratulations, Duk Seon.

29
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,030
You just got yourself
a boyfriend again.

30
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,130
Shut it!

31
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,130
Pipe down, already.

32
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,930
When I think about how humiliated
I was because of you two, I... geez!

33
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:08,530
Hey.

34
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,730
Also, what do you guys
even know about men anyway, huh?

35
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:18,030
If you rush to conclusions
one more time, I'll end you!

36
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,530
All right, already.

37
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,930
Hey, Joey Wang.

38
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,330
Your hair color looks nice.

39
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,530
What did you dye it with?

40
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:27,730
Oh, this?

41
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,030
Hydrogen peroxide.

42
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,430
What?
You did that to your hair?

43
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,830
Just get it done at the salon!

44
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,030
Hey.

45
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,630
Why don't you stay out of this one,
Ms. Rich Girl?

46
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,830
Us two, broke girls
are in the middle of talking.

47
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:42,430
Wow, Sung Duk Seon!

48
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,930
You know the English word, "talking?"

49
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,530
Are you kidding me?

50
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,860
Should I dye my hair
during winter break, too?

51
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,430
I have hydrogen peroxide at home.

52
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,230
Don't, don't.
Use something else.

53
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,530
My head hurts so much from the smell.

54
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,230
Really?
What should I use, then?

55
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:57,730
What else?

56
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:29,030
Duk Seon.

57
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,830
Where did you go this morning?

58
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,330
To meet the girls.

59
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,730
- What did you eat?
- Ddukbokki.

60
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:37,630
Why?
Did something happen?

61
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,830
Never mind.

62
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,630
What's with Mom?
Did something happen?

63
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:53,230
Apparently, 30,000 won
disappeared from her wallet.

64
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,030
So?

65
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,630
It wasn't you?

66
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,430
What does she take me for?

67
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:07,330
Where's the hair dryer?

68
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:17,430
Why are you digging through
someone else's wallet?

69
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,130
You call yourself
an older sister?

70
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,930
How could you doubt
your younger sister?

71
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,930
Here!
Happy?

72
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,230
Huh?

73
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,530
If it's not you, whatever.

74
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:36,330
It wasn't me, Mom!
It really wasn't me!

75
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,330
I didn't take it!

76
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,930
I don't even know
where you keep your wallet!

77
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:42,530
Why are you doubting me?

78
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:46,530
I really didn't take it!
Really!

79
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:49,030
Okay, Duk Seon.
Okay.

80
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,530
I'm sorry.

81
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,630
Want a sweet potato?

82
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,930
Oh geez...

83
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:08,230
Does it taste good?

84
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:09,730
Yes.

85
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:11,930
But Mom...

86
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,130
Yes?

87
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,230
It might be No Eul.

88
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:20,230
He's the only one who
could have done it, right?

89
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:25,300
Even if he did,
don't say anything to him.

90
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,330
He'll feel hurt by that
and go down a crooked path.

91
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:33,330
He'll rebel because I suspected him.
Got it?

92
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,030
Okay?

93
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,430
What about me, then?

94
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,830
You're not worried about me
going down a crooked path?

95
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,630
Bo Ra...
Have some sweet potatoes.

96
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,730
What about me?

97
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:53,930
I'm only a year older than him!
I feel hurt too, you know!

98
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,930
Oh yeah.

99
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:07,330
Isn't today the day that Jung Bong
gets the test results?

100
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:08,530
Probably.

101
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:10,130
I wonder how he did...

102
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:30,130
We could have misheard.
I'll call them again.

103
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,630
<i>I'm sorry.
You didn't pass.</i>

104
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:59,230
I apologize.

105
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:03,230
I have nothing to say.

106
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,230
Geez.

107
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,030
It's fine.

108
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:09,330
You can just take it again. Right?

109
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:16,030
Geez, you're going to cause an earthquake
with your tremendous sighs!

110
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:19,340
What's on your head? Is it Sports Day?
Are you cheering for the white team?

111
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:22,130
Jung Bong.
Go to your room and rest.

112
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:24,330
You're being hospitalized tomorrow.
It's no good for you to be stressed.

113
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,230
Hurry!
Go to your room!

114
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:39,030
It's fine!
Chin up, okay?

115
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,500
Kim Jung Bong!
These things happen!

116
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,500
They call it an exam
because you might fail!

117
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,130
It wouldn't be an exam if everyone
passed every time! It's okay! Okay?

118
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,130
If only he wasn't getting surgery...

119
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:57,030
Even so, he grew up so well.

120
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,130
I'm thankful, even just for that.

121
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:04,430
You sure are hard to please.

122
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:06,530
Did you forget everything already?

123
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:07,930
No...

124
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:14,030
Honey, leave the house
for about two hours.

125
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,930
Go to Mr. Choi's
jewelry shop or something.

126
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,030
And what will you be doing?

127
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,630
The lady from Amore is coming.

128
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,330
Just go play outside for two hours.

129
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,730
Are you going to buy makeup again?

130
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:24,730
Just leave!

131
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,830
Okay, okay.
I'm going.

132
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,530
But why two hours?
Doesn't it usually only last an hour?

133
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,630
The woman from Jutanhak is coming too.

134
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,820
Oh.

135
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:38,330
Oh.

136
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,530
Oh, really?

137
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:45,330
Yeah, I ate.

138
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,630
Where would I go, on a weekend?

139
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,330
No. I told you,
I'm not going.

140
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,430
You're going?

141
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:56,730
It can't be helped then.

142
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,130
We can just meet up next week.

143
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:02,930
Don't be disappointed that
I'm not asking you not to go.

144
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:05,530
I thought you were going because
you had something to take care of.

145
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:07,130
I told you, go ahead.

146
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,030
I'll be fine.

147
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,630
<i>What?</i>

148
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:13,230
Hurry it up.
I'm expecting a call.

149
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:15,430
Yeah.

150
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:18,230
Okay.
See you next week.

151
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:19,230
Okay.

152
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:23,130
Who would you be expecting a call from?

153
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:26,130
Dong Ryong! We're going to watch
the Pop Top Ten together today.

154
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:29,030
When did you guys ever
call before meeting up?

155
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,311
Hello?

156
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,480
Hello?

157
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,680
Oh, Hwang Hee Soo?
What's up?

158
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,780
Right now?

159
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,680
Hi, Bo Ra.

160
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,280
That's "hello" to you, punk.

161
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,380
Hello.

162
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,180
Are you going somewhere?

163
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,680
I'm going to see my boyfriend.

164
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:09,700
Oh, top-of-the-morning to you!

165
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,580
Greet me properly, damn it!

166
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,480
Yes, ma'am.
Sorry, ma'am.

167
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,680
Watch yourself, kid.

168
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,280
I will indeed watch myself, ma'am!

169
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,680
You like her, even when she's like that?

170
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,200
Not that attitude in particular.

171
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,580
Right?

172
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,380
You're human after all, too, huh?

173
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:29,180
What are you going to do? She says
she's going to see her boyfriend.

174
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,650
No, she isn't.

175
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:34,080
When she goes to meet her boyfriend,
she always wears a skirt.

176
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,380
But look.
She wore pants.

177
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,180
She just lied on purpose,
for me to hear.

178
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,400
Geez... that freak.

179
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,280
He freaks me out.

180
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,780
She's not human.

181
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,080
What is she then?

182
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,980
A daffodil...

183
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,680
Crazy bastard.

184
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,380
You've moved on
from Joey Wang, then?

185
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,260
Yeah.
Ji Yeon's the best.

186
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,480
She's not really my type.

187
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,280
Yeah, of course not.

188
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,980
What?

189
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,680
This bastard is into aggressive girls.

190
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,380
You know, strong girls and such.

191
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,680
Yeah.

192
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,680
You know, someone like Bo Ra.

193
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,380
What?

194
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,880
Well, that's plausible.

195
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,180
But I'll bet that even she doesn't
act that way in front of her boyfriend.

196
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,980
What do you mean?

197
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:44,680
Wow... you guys really
don't know anything.

198
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,980
All you know are formulas.
You know nothing about women.

199
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,080
No matter how much girls fool around
and do the crab-leg dance at home

200
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:54,080
she'll be on her best behavior
in front of the guy she likes.

201
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:58,580
If a girl fools around or does
the crab-leg dance in front of you...

202
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:01,180
that means that she doesn't
see you as a man.

203
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,580
If she did, she wouldn't be
act like that, no matter what.

204
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,280
She'd be too embarrassed.

205
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,780
<i>Who is it?</i>

206
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,780
I'm the young lady from Amore!

207
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,580
Sun Young?

208
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:15,380
This feels so good...

209
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:21,480
- Wow... thanks to you...
- This is great...

210
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,980
She does it the best.

211
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,080
It feels so nice.

212
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,380
Don't smile.
You'll get wrinkles.

213
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,580
Your skin is so good!

214
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,260
Maybe it's because you're
an affluent woman?

215
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,980
She's always had great skin.

216
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:38,080
Even so, she took such good care of it.

217
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,280
And it seems that
she never gets stressed out!

218
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,980
Well, figures, since
you live in such a big home.

219
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,080
What concerns could you possibly have?

220
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,760
Does it really seem like that?

221
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,680
Of course!

222
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:55,480
You look like such an affluent woman
who's never suffered once in her life!

223
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,280
Wow... I'm so jealous!

224
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,760
Does it really seem that way?

225
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,340
She really looks like someone
who's never suffered once in her life?

226
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,680
Yes!

227
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:09,080
- Wow... you've succeeded!
- I'll say.

228
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,080
What do you mean?

229
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,080
Oh, nothing.

230
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,080
Oh yeah.

231
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,280
You're going to give us
a lot of samples today, right?

232
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,680
Of course! You bought all that makeup,
so of course I will!

233
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,910
Just give us 300 or so.

234
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:25,080
Oh, my!

235
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,860
- Rock, papers, scissors, shoot!
- Rock, papers, scissors, shoot!

236
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,280
- All right!
- All right!

237
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,280
I'm not good at making ramen, though.

238
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,090
<i>[La Bamba]</i>

239
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:37,340
Stop messing around. You make it every
day because of Jung Bong. Hurry up, go!

240
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,920
I'm hungry!
Hurry up!

241
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,580
Damn it...

242
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,580
Hey... it's been a while
since Taek's been home.

243
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:46,300
Ramyun won't do. Let's just order in.
Okay? How about it?

244
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,780
- I want ramen.
- You little...

245
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:52,180
Don't turn it on until I get back,
all right? I haven't seen "La Bamba!"

246
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,780
Hurry the hell up and go!

247
00:15:55,990 --> 00:16:08,010
<i>I've never been the same...
because I love my girl...</i>

248
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,180
Oh yeah.

249
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,130
You didn't forget about tomorrow...
right, Taek?

250
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:15,270
Wow... look at you and
your selective memory.

251
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,680
You forgot, didn't you?

252
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,980
We're all going to see a movie
in Jongro tomorrow, remember?

253
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:24,580
I bought the tickets
at the theater in Jongro.

254
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,580
I stood in line for an hour!

255
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,580
I remember now.

256
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:31,580
I have a competition tomorrow though,
and it'll be late when it's over.

257
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:35,080
Hey, that's why we decided to see it
in the evening, in the first place!

258
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,280
Did you forget?

259
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,680
Oh yeah... you're right.

260
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,680
Yes, that's right, Master Choi Taek.
Do you even know where the theater is?

261
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,810
Yeah. I just have to go to Jongro.
The Dansungsa Theater... right?

262
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:46,280
Yes, that's right...
but just wait for us at the club.

263
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,080
We'll come pick you up.

264
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,080
It's fine.
You think I can't even find a theater?

265
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,080
- Yep. You can't.
- Yep. You can't.

266
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,380
It's on the way to the theater anyway,
so we'll come get you.

267
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:59,780
Don't take a taxi, get off somewhere
weird, and wander away again.

268
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:00,980
Got it?

269
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:04,180
Don't go wandering off,
and wait for me... okay, honey?

270
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,580
Hasn't it been forever
since you went to the movies?

271
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,050
Not since we finished
graduated middle school, right?

272
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:09,450
He went with me a while ago.

273
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:12,080
Oh, really? Was it fun?
What did you watch?

274
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,380
As if he'd know.
He slept through the whole thing.

275
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,580
He'd stayed up two nights in a row
before he came.

276
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,480
<i>Who is it?</i>

277
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,780
I'm the lady from Jutanhak!

278
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,080
What the hell is this?

279
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:24,280
I just tossed in
whatever was in the fridge.

280
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,280
That's how we make it at our place.

281
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,580
My older brother eats like this.

282
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,680
It tastes great!

283
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,680
Thanks.

284
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,780
When is his surgery?

285
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,580
This weekend.
He'll be hospitalized tomorrow.

286
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:42,980
We all have to go visit him there.
Which hospital is it?

287
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:45,280
No need for that... he's just
having a one-hour surgery.

288
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,280
You don't need to come.

289
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,080
One hour?
It only takes that long?

290
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,180
Didn't it take about ten hours last year?

291
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,580
He had to get new valves that time.

292
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,880
This time, they're just
changing the batteries in it.

293
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,380
What about his exam?
Did he get into college?

294
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,680
He failed.

295
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,480
Your nose is bleeding.

296
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,980
I guess winter really has come.

297
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,580
What if you're sick, too?

298
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,980
What are you saying?

299
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,180
He got a checkup,
but they said he's fine.

300
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:22,180
They said it was his immune system.
He and his brother have weak bodies.

301
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,680
Geez... I wonder how many perverted
things he saw for it to be this bad.

302
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,380
It's because of my immune system, okay?

303
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,380
Good for you.

304
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,680
You little...

305
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,180
Even so, I'll bet your mother
feels sad about it.

306
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,480
Even if it's a simple surgery.

307
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,580
Who?
My mom?

308
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,880
We're talking about Ms. Ra here.

309
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:44,080
- Wow, feels great!
- My face feels so soft.

310
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,980
Sun Young, look at my face!
How does it look?

311
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:48,580
You look beautiful!

312
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:53,080
Thanks!
You look pretty, too!

313
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,980
I feel like an affluent woman!

314
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,480
Wow... look at your hands!

315
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,980
Wow... they're so soft!

316
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:04,180
I'll bet this lady lives like a queen!

317
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,600
Why do you say that?

318
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,760
Your hands are so soft. It looks
like they've never touched cold water.

319
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,480
Isn't that right?

320
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,690
And you have no worry lines
on your face either!

321
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:18,380
I'm so jealous!

322
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:21,180
Oh my... even it's just flattery,
it's nice to hear.

323
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,680
What do you mean?
It's as clear as day, here!

324
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:27,280
But... you're going to give us
a lot of samples, right?

325
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,680
The young lady from Amore left us a ton!

326
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,280
Oh, of course!
I'll leave you a ton!

327
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,480
You bought so much at once, after all!

328
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,280
Just leave us 300 or so.

329
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,580
Let me see your face.

330
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:51,180
Wow, you're glowing!

331
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,580
No matter how I look at you

332
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:55,280
you're not the same person
you were three years ago.

333
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,180
Is there anyone who has
suffered as much as you?

334
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:03,080
Just ask anyone who has suffered
more than you to step forward!

335
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,880
Words can't express
just how much you've suffered.

336
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,680
Geez... yeah.
Strange things happen in life, huh?

337
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:12,780
I can't believe they'd say such things.

338
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,380
You suffered so much
when Jung Bong got sick.

339
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:21,180
Wow.
You're really a fighter.

340
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:24,580
You'd leave Jung Bong at home to go work.

341
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,380
You used to wallpaper
people's walls, right?

342
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:29,580
Well... yeah, I'd do that,
and I would deliver newspapers.

343
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,580
And I worked at a restaurant.

344
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,580
You're really incredible.

345
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:37,480
If someone told me my child had
heart disease, I'd pass out right there.

346
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,980
What else was I supposed to do?

347
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:42,580
He had to get surgery,
but I had no money.

348
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,580
I had to earn money any way I could.

349
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:48,180
There were times that my husband and I
starved for a day or two, too.

350
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,780
Wow... and you didn't even tell me!

351
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,090
You're really something!

352
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:54,680
It's not like I was the only poor one.
You two had it worse.

353
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,280
Well, yes.

354
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:01,080
Oh, yeah. What kind of surgery
is he getting this time?

355
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,980
Didn't he get a new valve
or something last time?

356
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:08,580
Yeah. He got that surgery last year.

357
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,680
Why does he need surgery again?

358
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,580
Oh, it's a simple one this time around.

359
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:15,180
There's a battery-like thing inside,
and they need to swap it.

360
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,780
It'll be about... an hour?
Two, if it takes a long time.

361
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,050
It'll be over quickly, then.

362
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:20,680
Yeah.

363
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:25,180
Wow... even so, if my child were
getting surgery, simple as it may be...

364
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:29,290
I'd be so nervous,
I wouldn't able to eat anything!

365
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:31,280
Why worry?

366
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,880
We have money now, so the best doctor
in Korea is operating on him.

367
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,480
There's nothing to worry about.

368
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,680
Wow... you're such a tough one!

369
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,180
That's how she managed to endure
during those hard times!

370
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:45,580
Otherwise, you would've
gone mad already, right?

371
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,580
Exactly.

372
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,480
But where's Jung Bong?
Where did he go?

373
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:16,380
Hey. We've heard all the songs
on the LP already.

374
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,880
Hurry up and spill it.

375
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,080
What is it?

376
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,180
What's so bad that
you can't tell a friend?

377
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,880
Bo Ra.

378
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,880
Yeah?

379
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,980
Um... about Jong Hoon...

380
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,780
Jong Hoon?

381
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,180
Um, no...
I mean, upperclassman Jong Hoon.

382
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,280
What is this?

383
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:45,380
Why are you referring to
my boyfriend so casually?

384
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:47,380
There's really nothing between us.

385
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,580
What do you mean?

386
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,780
Did something happen
between you two?

387
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:58,980
I felt that you should know,
no matter what.

388
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:03,280
On the day you couldn't go on the
retreat because of family issues...

389
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,380
I had a lot to drink that day.

390
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:12,280
I drank a lot, and upperclassman
Jong Hoon was really drunk too.

391
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,480
And so?

392
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,080
I went out for a bit
to get some fresh air...

393
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,380
and upperclassman Jong Hoon followed
me out, saying his head hurt too.

394
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,880
Did you two kiss?

395
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,580
I'm sorry, Bo Ra.

396
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,180
It was honestly a mistake!

397
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:43,080
The two of us were way too drunk.
We weren't in our right minds.

398
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,780
I'm really sorry.

399
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:56,180
I felt so bad, I couldn't even
look you in the eyes properly.

400
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:01,680
Even so, you're my friend, so...

401
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,480
you're my best friend, so...

402
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,880
I couldn't just keep quiet
and let it slide.

403
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,280
Bo Ra!

404
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,880
I'm sorry.
Really.

405
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,880
It's fine.

406
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,780
I'm not going to associate
myself with him anymore.

407
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,680
So don't cry.

408
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:25,780
And I'm not associating myself
with you anymore, either.

409
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,380
Friend?

410
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,380
As if.

411
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:45,980
<i>Buckwheat jelly for sale!</i>

412
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:50,280
<i>Buckwheat jelly for sale!</i>

413
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,580
No Eul, what time is it now?

414
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,480
I bet your dad is having
a drink somewhere again.

415
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:03,480
Geez... what a wretched fate...

416
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,280
My Il Hwa!

417
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,180
I'm home!

418
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,080
Hey. Your hubby is here!

419
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,980
You're at it again! You drank up a storm,
didn't you?

420
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:21,780
Geez... is that any way
to talk to your husband?

421
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:25,180
I really tried to come home early today

422
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:28,380
but there was something really important
to be done at the bank, so...

423
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:32,580
it couldn't be helped,
and I just had one drink.

424
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:36,580
Work, my ass! How is it that you have to
work overtime every single day?

425
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,380
And just what is that, now?

426
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:44,880
This is a liquid that erases ink!

427
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,980
It's the first time you've seen
such a thing, right?

428
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,240
So, uh...

429
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:54,490
I was taking the subway
on my way home

430
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:59,680
and I saw a kid,
about No Eul's age, selling these!

431
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,380
Oh my, oh my...

432
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:06,880
You know as well as I do that
I usually don't buy this kind of stuff!

433
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,280
But they said that this
really erases ink!

434
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:15,380
I would've regretted it if I didn't
buy it, so I bought just one.

435
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:18,580
And then... I bought just one more!

436
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:23,580
And then, just... three!

437
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,580
Wait a minute.
Where's the ink?

438
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,080
Let's just see.

439
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:50,180
It's okay!

440
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:54,380
I can just get it out
with this stuff!

441
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:57,380
Just watch! Just watch.

442
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:01,080
You take this here, and
do this, and then... this.

443
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,380
You just sprinkle it on here,
like so. Rub, rub, rub, rub!

444
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:10,080
And then, you just rub it in!
Like this! Rub, rub, rub, rub.

445
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,310
Rub, rub, rub, rub!

446
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,930
This is weird... it worked so well
during the demo on the subway.

447
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:26,380
Geez... you half-wit! Half-wit!

448
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,880
How can you call your husband that?
A half-wit? A half-wit?

449
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,000
What else would you be then?
You idiot!

450
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,200
Huh?
What does that mean?

451
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,280
I'm calling you an idiot, stupid!

452
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:44,010
How dare you call your husband an idiot?
Why I ought to--

453
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:46,760
Wow, what a saint we have here!

454
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,660
How many years ago
was your last promotion?

455
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,360
Why the hell are you
bringing that up now?

456
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:54,960
What does that have
to do with this liquid?

457
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,060
If you had performed
your wifely duties better

458
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,960
I would have kept on
being promoted by now--

459
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,860
Promoted, my ass!

460
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:07,810
My ass? My ass?
How dare you talk to me that way?

461
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:09,180
Yeah, you heard me!

462
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,760
If only... imagine you didn't
rack up all that debt?

463
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,260
Would we still be living like this,
in a half-basement? Huh?

464
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:17,460
Why are you bringing up
irrelevant things again?

465
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:20,660
I dare you to say that again!
I'll kill you!

466
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:21,760
What did you say?

467
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,360
What did you say you'd do to me?

468
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,060
Go ahead and try to kill me, then!
Go ahead!

469
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,860
- What are you doing?
- Go ahead!

470
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:29,860
You must be out of your mind!

471
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,460
Just try and kill me!

472
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,460
Are you... okay?

473
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,460
What do we do?

474
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,560
Can you see with that eye?

475
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,960
How many fingers am I holding up?

476
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,560
Try and count them.

477
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,960
I'll kill you...

478
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,960
What's all this, Big Bro?

479
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,660
This is my other half.

480
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:23,760
These are my Rubik's cubes...

481
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:28,460
And this is my stamp collection.

482
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:36,460
And these are my
Campus Music Festival LPs.

483
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:42,760
And these are all the
movie posters I've collected.

484
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:51,960
And this is... my journal.

485
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,760
I'll give you all of this.

486
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,460
I don't need any of this anymore.

487
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:02,060
Geez... quit overreacting!

488
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:05,160
Why are you making such a big deal
over an hour-long surgery?

489
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,760
Even so, surgery is surgery.

490
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,560
Big Bro.

491
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:14,460
They say that the chances of the surgery
failing are less than three percent.

492
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,960
I looked into it already.

493
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:25,360
The chance of getting heart disease when
you're young is less than two percent.

494
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:31,660
That's why... I'm so scared of
that three percent chance.

495
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,160
Geez...

496
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:53,560
Stop overreacting!

497
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:57,660
Big Bro! They say that it's a surgery
that doctors can do with their eyes shut.

498
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,960
Stop saying silly things
and go to sleep already.

499
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,960
Want to sleep with me tonight,
Little Bro?

500
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,260
That's a little...

501
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:11,160
Yeah.
I'm not too keen on it, either.

502
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,760
I'm home.

503
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,560
Oh, you're home?
Hurry and wash up.

504
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,660
Are you hungry?

505
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,860
I'm fine.

506
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:53,760
Oh my God, oh my God.
I'm totally hungry!

507
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,060
Want to eat red bean porridge?

508
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,060
Yeah.

509
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,460
Honey.

510
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:01,360
Do you want a bowl of
red bean porridge, too?

511
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,960
I do, indeed.

512
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,660
You must have been inconvenienced
by other household affairs...

513
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:11,260
When did you find the time
to make such a thing?

514
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,660
What's with your eye, Dad?
Did you get hit?

515
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,660
It's nothing, child of mine.

516
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,460
Mom threw a rock at him.

517
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,960
Do you want red bean porridge,
No Eul?

518
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,860
I'm good... ma'am.

519
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:23,860
All right.

520
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:24,860
Darling.

521
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:30,260
May I inconvenience you by
asking you for a glass of cold water?

522
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:33,060
Oh! Of course I'll get it for you!

523
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,360
Is there anything else you might like?

524
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,060
No, my lady.

525
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,460
Ah, yes.

526
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:45,100
I shall change the
charcoal briquette out tonight.

527
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,060
Oh my, I'm so thankful!

528
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,960
I'll leave it to you, then!

529
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,360
Don't stand the pillow up
like that, bastard.

530
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:58,160
If you could wait for me, my lady...

531
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,160
What's with them?

532
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,760
They decided to speak formally
to each other, starting today.

533
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,460
What?
Why?

534
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,860
They said they keep fighting because
of the way they speak to each other.

535
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:10,160
They say it's embarrassing
doing that in front of us.

536
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,860
This is more embarrassing, though.

537
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,160
Exactly, my lady.

538
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,960
Food's ready!
Time to eat!

539
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:26,960
Why don't any of you ever come out
the first time I call you?

540
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,360
What are you doing? Eat!

541
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,360
There's not much we're packing this year.

542
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:40,060
I stuffed the entire car
with luggage last year.

543
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,860
What's with this,
first thing in the morning?

544
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,960
Stop saying useless crap,
and eat already.

545
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,560
Bonggie!
Let's eat breakfast!

546
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,660
I don't want to.

547
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,260
Hurry and wake the hell up!

548
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:02,460
Don't ask me to make you something later!
Just eat with everyone else!

549
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:08,160
I don't think I can
stomach anything right now.

550
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,960
What the hell are you saying?
Hurry the hell up!

551
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,560
Mom.
We don't have pork cutlets?

552
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,860
We always have the same sides.

553
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:26,360
Just eat. Don't you complain
about side dishes either.

554
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:31,460
Honey, hurry over!
The soup will get cold!

555
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,660
Apparently, the two of them decided
to use formal speech with each other.

556
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:34,660
Isn't it hilarious?

557
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,860
Honey!

558
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:51,060
You must have waited for me.
You all should have eaten without me.

559
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,760
Even so, we have to wait for the
head of our household to eat first!

560
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,960
How long are you going to keep this up?
It's seriously embarrassing to watch.

561
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,560
Don't spill your food when you eat!

562
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:02,160
Who do you take after
that you're so sloppy?

563
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:07,660
Did you say that with the intention to
have me freaking hear that, my lady?

564
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:12,160
Oh, no!
Of course not!

565
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,360
Let's eat.

566
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,160
Yes, hello?

567
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,860
They're looking for Bo Ra.

568
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,960
Tell them that I'm not here.

569
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,560
Yes, she told me to say
that she's not here.

570
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,760
Yes, I understand.

571
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,060
They said they'll call again.

572
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:41,760
I wonder who our No Eul took after,
that he's a bit slow in the head?

573
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:48,500
Did you, by chance, say that to imply
he's stupid because he takes after me?

574
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,460
Now, now... of course not.

575
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:53,660
Shall we eat?

576
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:55,160
Yes.

577
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:58,060
You're done eating already?
Have some more, will you?

578
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:00,660
No. I'm going to sleep.
Don't wake me up.

579
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,660
Jung Bong.

580
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:17,960
You've already had two of these difficult
surgeries. Why are you so worried?

581
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,850
Don't you worry one bit, okay?

582
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:22,160
Yes, Father.

583
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:26,260
Jung Hwan!
Hurry over.

584
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,760
Thank you for the meal.

585
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,260
You got another nosebleed?

586
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:35,060
It's not like this is anything new.

587
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:37,260
It always happens when
I wash up with warm water.

588
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:39,960
You're going this afternoon, right?

589
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:40,960
Yeah.

590
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,660
You don't have to come, though.

591
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:45,060
Yeah. There's no place
for you sleep there, anyway.

592
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,160
Just stay home.

593
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,360
It's not a big surgery. There's no need
for the whole family to be there.

594
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,460
Yeah. Come tomorrow, Jung Hwan.

595
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:55,460
The surgery is on the day after tomorrow
so you can just come tomorrow.

596
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,760
Okay.

597
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,260
Taek should be done by now, right?

598
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,250
Yeah, he has to be.
Just look at the time.

599
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:09,560
I wonder if he won.
Isn't the competition today a huge one?

600
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,160
I'm sure he won.

601
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:14,260
Isn't it because he was confident,
he agreed to see it in the first place?

602
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,460
We're here.
I see the Baduk Club.

603
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:18,060
What time was the movie, again?

604
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,160
Hey, over here.

605
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,460
Hey, go and get Taek.

606
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,860
You have to hold his hand tight
so you don't lose him, okay?

607
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,260
Want me to come with you?

608
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,260
It's fine.

609
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,060
Master Choi!

610
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,260
You've worked hard.

611
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,560
Congratulations.

612
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,160
Thank you.

613
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,760
It's an honor, Sir!

614
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,860
Congratulations, Sir!

615
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:06,960
You've worked hard, Sir.

616
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,360
Congratulations, Sir!

617
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,860
You've worked hard, Sir.

618
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,360
You've worked hard, Sir!

619
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:22,060
Hey, what about your bag?
You had it this morning.

620
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,060
Oh yeah.

621
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,060
You did it again!

622
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:27,160
What the hell do you do
with that brain of yours?

623
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,660
Hurry up and get it.

624
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,960
I'll get it for you, Sir!

625
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,960
No, it's okay!

626
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,260
He needs some exercise.

627
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,860
I'll be at the food cart over there.
Come over there, okay?

628
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:39,860
Okay.

629
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,760
Don't mope around!
Come straight there, got it?

630
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,960
Okay.

631
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:51,660
Then... goodbye.

632
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:02,260
<i>[Korean University Hospital]</i>

633
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:16,360
Jung Bong!

634
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,860
Let's eat!

635
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:21,960
There's a pork cutlet place
out front, so I got some to go.

636
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,660
Oh, good.

637
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:26,940
He won't be allowed to eat starting
tomorrow, so let's feed him a lot today.

638
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,560
I don't want to eat, though.

639
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,960
Stop talking nonsense
and get over here.

640
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,760
Mr. Kim Jung Bong.

641
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,760
- Yes.
- Yes.

642
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,860
His surgery is
the day after tomorrow, yes?

643
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:40,860
Yes, Doctor.

644
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:42,160
The surgery we'll be doing will involve

645
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,160
making adjustments to his
artificial heart's pacemaker.

646
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,260
You can just think of this as
a surgery to switch the batteries

647
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:49,760
on the pacemaker we inserted during
last year's cardiac valve surgery.

648
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,060
They last about five to ten years,
but there are some instances in which

649
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:56,360
surgery is needed, when they're placed
in less-than-ideal locations.

650
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:59,560
It's a simple surgery... right, Doctor?

651
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,910
There's no such thing as
a "simple surgery" in this world.

652
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:03,160
We have to open him up to know for sure.

653
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:06,460
But, even so... I heard that these types
of surgeries end in about an hour or so.

654
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:09,760
Even I, a doctor, doesn't know that,
so how would you know?

655
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,980
We'll only know after we do the surgery.

656
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,160
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

657
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:20,040
He could have spoken
a bit more kindly to us.

658
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,060
How could we ask him anything,
with him being so intimidating?

659
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,760
He's always like that.

660
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,260
He was like that last year, too.

661
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:29,260
And doctors always talk like that.
It's not exactly a new development.

662
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,360
Jung Bong, let's--

663
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:48,260
Hello?

664
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:51,660
Yes, are you looking for Bo Ra?

665
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,460
And who are you?

666
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:58,160
Oh.
Okay. Just a minute.

667
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,560
Bo Ra, pick up the phone!

668
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,660
They say they're your friend,
Park Jong Hoon!

669
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,960
But, um...
what relationship do you have with my--

670
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,660
Don't pick up his calls, Mom.
He's a crazy bastard.

671
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,260
Geez.

672
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:51,260
I feel like Bo Ra is irritated
about something lately.

673
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:54,060
I almost pissed my pants the other day
because of her!

674
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:56,060
She got into a huge fight
with her boyfriend.

675
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:57,260
Wow.

676
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:59,060
She has a boyfriend?

677
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:01,260
Yeah. But I think they'll break up soon.

678
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:04,760
Even so, who in their right mind
would like her?

679
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:07,440
You'd have to be a real piece of work,
that's for sure.

680
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:17,760
Jung Hwan!
Come sit over here.

681
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,190
No thanks.
We're almost here, anyway.

682
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,860
Where are you going?

683
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:44,060
To the waiting room.
I'm going to go watch some TV.

684
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:45,260
You go to sleep first.

685
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:46,760
Yeah, okay.

686
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:49,060
My Mi Ran...

687
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,460
You've gotten so strong.

688
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:54,660
You couldn't even
fall asleep in past years.

689
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:56,960
Now, you can even watch TV.

690
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,760
I'm not the same as I was back then.

691
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,960
This kind of surgery isn't even surgery.

692
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,660
I'll just watch the Drama Awards
and come right back.

693
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:46,860
Did Jung Bong get admitted
to the hospital already?

694
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:47,960
You don't need to go?

695
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,160
They said to come tomorrow.

696
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,060
Thinking about it,
it's been a really long time

697
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:52,860
since we've played soccer with him.

698
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:57,260
We used to play soccer with him so much,
up until the night of his first surgery.

699
00:45:58,460 --> 00:45:59,460
Jung Hwan.

700
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:02,360
Wasn't it your dream in elementary school
to be a professional soccer player?

701
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:04,360
Because you were crazy about
Diego Maradona?

702
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:07,260
This punk was good at soccer
back in the day, too...

703
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:11,760
Geez.
He's sleeping so soundly.

704
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:16,060
I'm sleeping.

705
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:17,360
Okay.

706
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:20,260
Ugh, it smells!

707
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:22,660
When did you fart?
Damn it!

708
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:23,960
Ten minutes ago.

709
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:26,160
Just what the hell do you eat?

710
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:30,660
Do you smell it?

711
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:32,060
- Of course!
- I don't smell it, though.

712
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:33,960
- What the hell are you saying?
- What the hell are you saying?

713
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:36,660
I don't smell anything.
Hold on.

714
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:41,060
- Damn it!
- Damn it!

715
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:42,760
Why?
Just... why?

716
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:56,960
<i>[Do Not Feed]</i>

717
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,360
Isn't it about time for
Jung Hwan to be here?

718
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:03,960
I told him to bring my razor.

719
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:04,960
Big Bro.

720
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,560
- You're here?
- What about my razor?

721
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:07,560
Oh, here.

722
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,660
Geez... you're fine, right?

723
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:19,160
What's with you? You were once in surgery
for ten hours, and you were fine.

724
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:23,060
Where did you get such precious things
like pineapples and bananas?

725
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:24,060
Did you buy them?

726
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:25,160
Oh, Taek gave those to me.

727
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:28,160
He got them as a gift, and he
gave them to me to give to Big Bro.

728
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:32,860
He's not allowed to eat, already?

729
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:35,060
They just put that sign up now.

730
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,160
Wait here.
Let me go ask the doctor.

731
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:38,960
Yes, go ahead.

732
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:47,060
Um, excuse me...
where is Dr. Choi Hyun Sung?

733
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:49,260
What is it, ma'am?
Please tell me.

734
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:52,760
I have something to ask the doctor.

735
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:55,060
Oh, here he comes now.

736
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:57,960
Oh, hello, Doctor.

737
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:01,460
Um, Doctor...

738
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:04,660
My child's younger brother's friend
is Choi Taek.

739
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:06,060
He's a really famous Baduk player.

740
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:08,260
You've heard of him, right?

741
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:15,660
He sent pineapples and bananas
for my boy.

742
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:17,760
Couldn't he just have a little bit?

743
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,160
They only put the "Do Not Feed"
sign up a short while ago.

744
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,360
He'll fast as soon as he's done
eating this, I promise. Please?

745
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:26,860
Do whatever you want.

746
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:27,860
Excuse me?

747
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:29,660
I said, do whatever you want.

748
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:47,160
Did you get a nosebleed this morning?

749
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:48,860
Huh?

750
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:51,060
When did this happen?

751
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:56,860
How strange. I used to get nosebleeds
a lot too, around your age.

752
00:48:56,860 --> 00:49:00,360
That's a really useful trait
you passed down to him, isn't it?

753
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,660
Give this to Jung Bong.

754
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:06,560
No, no thank you.

755
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,460
Jung Hwan, eat up.

756
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:12,660
What's this? You're giving up food
to someone else for a change?

757
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:15,360
You really are scared of getting surgery,
aren't you?

758
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,960
I don't have a good feeling
about this one.

759
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:22,260
Stop that kind of talk this instant!

760
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:24,960
They said it's a surgery that
even little kids handle well!

761
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,660
Stop spouting nonsense
and eat this banana, already!

762
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:30,760
Yes, Sir.

763
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,860
I'm expecting a call.

764
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:43,960
Hurry it up.

765
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:46,260
Oh, okay.

766
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:49,040
You're coming to our neighborhood?

767
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:53,410
No, I'll just meet you in front of
Sungshin Women's University...

768
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:57,060
Okay.

769
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:59,760
I'll wait for you
in front of the bus station.

770
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:02,660
Okay.

771
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:11,160
You have a girlfriend?

772
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:12,860
What school?
What grade?

773
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:15,360
A student should be studying!

774
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:17,160
Is this the time for you
to have a girlfriend?

775
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:18,260
I'm going to tell Mom!

776
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:21,760
Geez... I've only met her
a couple of times.

777
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,760
She's not my girlfriend.

778
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:27,150
I'm breaking up with her today.

779
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:29,660
She's not even your girlfriend,
so why do you need to break up?

780
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,360
She has one-sided feelings for me.

781
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,960
For you?
Why?

782
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,260
What's with this development?
You expect me to believe that?

783
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:39,660
It's the truth.

784
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:41,760
Just let me off the hook for today.

785
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:44,960
I'm going to take care of it.

786
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:50,960
You better take care of it
by today, got it?

787
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:10,760
Um... Soo Kyung.

788
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:12,360
I think we should break--

789
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,860
What the flying f--k!
That f--king scared me!

790
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:20,560
Hey.

791
00:51:21,850 --> 00:51:23,060
What did you say, just now?

792
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:24,260
Nothing, I swear.

793
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:26,960
I thought I just heard you say
that we should break up.

794
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:29,660
Why?

795
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,760
- You don't like me anymore?
- No, I like you.

796
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:32,760
You little...

797
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,760
Do you take me for a fool?

798
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:36,760
Hey.

799
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:41,160
Even if we started on your terms,
we can't part on your terms, too.

800
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,960
What's with your hair?

801
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:00,360
I got a pinkle-perm.
This was seriously expensive!

802
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:03,860
Hey. Who cares if it's expensive?
It doesn't suit you at all.

803
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,660
You two have weirder hair, you know!

804
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,160
What's with you?
You dyed your hair again?

805
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,260
Yeah.
It cost a bit, too.

806
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:13,260
I knew you'd end up
doing that eventually.

807
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:14,360
It looks pretty.

808
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:15,360
- It's pretty, right?
- Yeah.

809
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,060
I used two bottles of
hydrogen peroxide for this color.

810
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:18,060
Really?

811
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:21,360
Way to go.

812
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:28,060
Hey.
Isn't that your younger brother?

813
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:40,060
Wow, No Eul!
You're hanging out with girls already?

814
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:41,760
Who are you ladies?

815
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,460
You know my No Eul?

816
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:46,060
Wow, you're so skilled, No Eul!

817
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:48,560
Wow...

818
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:51,260
How pathetic.
Really.

819
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:53,660
No Eul.
You don't want to come with us?

820
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:55,060
I'll buy you ddukbokki.

821
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:56,060
Hey.

822
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:58,160
No Eul has plans with us.

823
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,760
Please go on ahead.

824
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:07,260
Hey, No Eul...
are you crying?

825
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:12,060
Hey, you made my younger brother cry?

826
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:13,660
- Let go!
- Did you make him cry?

827
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:15,860
- Huh?
- Are you out of your damn mind?

828
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:16,860
Oh no!

829
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:25,260
Hey!

830
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:39,060
<i>Spread the wings of adventure!</i>

831
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:42,060
<i>The Boy of the Sun, Esteban!</i>

832
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:45,660
<i>Open up the dictionary of youth.</i>

833
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:48,860
<i>There's no such thing
as "impossible!"</i>

834
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:55,760
<i>Let's follow the path that the horizon
has drawn for us, with the seagulls...</i>

835
00:54:55,760 --> 00:55:01,060
<i>let's run with vigor
toward the faraway horizon!</i>

836
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:04,360
Look like my daughter
is having a lot of fun!

837
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:05,360
Where are you going, Mom?

838
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:07,560
It's raining.
I have to go get the laundry.

839
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:08,960
It's cold.
I'll do it, Mom.

840
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,360
Just a moment, Jin Joo.

841
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:11,360
I'll be right back.

842
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:12,860
I'll do it.

843
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:14,860
Okay, then.

844
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:21,060
Oh yeah!

845
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,060
Let's run, let's run!

846
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:26,160
Good job, good job!

847
00:55:58,060 --> 00:55:59,660
Let's talk.

848
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:01,260
I have nothing to say to you.

849
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:09,460
Even so... you can at least
hear me out, can't you?

850
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:39,260
Wow... they're all frozen solid!

851
00:56:57,860 --> 00:56:59,850
It was a mistake, is all.

852
00:56:59,850 --> 00:57:04,960
I drank way too much,
and I wasn't thinking.

853
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:09,560
The weird thing is... I only remembered
all of this after I woke up the next day.

854
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:12,560
It was a mistake.

855
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:14,060
Okay?

856
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:18,660
Okay, yes.
Mistake or not, it's my fault.

857
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:22,460
I know. I'm the crazy bastard here.
I really am...

858
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:25,760
such a crazy bastard... geez.

859
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:28,760
I'm really sorry.

860
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:32,060
Forgive me just this once.

861
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:35,260
If I ever do that again, I...

862
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:37,560
I'm sorry.
I really am.

863
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:40,960
Okay?

864
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,660
Will anything change
just because you're sorry?

865
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:48,860
A mistake?

866
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:51,560
You've never done such a thing
under the influence before.

867
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:53,560
I've never seen you do that.

868
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:57,260
I don't understand you,
and I can't forgive you.

869
00:57:57,260 --> 00:58:00,260
I just can't rationalize what you did.

870
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:02,360
You call yourself a human being?

871
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:05,460
How could you do that
with my best friend?

872
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:08,060
Just let me go this once, already!

873
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:10,760
Hey, I said I was sorry!

874
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:12,660
How many damn times
did I say it already? Geez.

875
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:13,960
Wait a minute.

876
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:18,760
What qualifies you to be
so high and mighty, huh?

877
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:20,260
Are you perfect?

878
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:21,260
You never make mistakes?

879
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:25,060
Yes, that's right...
you are perfect.

880
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:26,360
Yeah.

881
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:28,160
You're smart.

882
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:33,260
You always have to be number one,
and you hate receiving help from anyone.

883
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:36,760
You rush home just because
your boyfriend got a little drunk.

884
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:38,860
And you act repulsed, like I'm an insect,
when I try to hold your hand.

885
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:40,860
Look!
Look!

886
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:42,360
Shit.

887
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:44,960
Do you even have emotions?
Do you?

888
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,560
I've never met a more inconsiderate,
cold bitch than you.

889
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:50,150
Really, you're the first.

890
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,160
Whatever.

891
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:57,560
Dating you, I felt so suffocated
that I thought I'd die.

892
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:02,660
I feel like I'm not dating a girl...
more like a hunk of ice.

893
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:06,360
If you don't fix that damn temper of
yours, you'll be alone forever.

894
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:07,360
You know that?

895
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:14,260
You're really the worst
a woman could ever be.

896
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:23,560
Whatever.

897
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:43,460
Wow... that guy really knows
nothing about you.

898
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:48,160
I don't need your pity.

899
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:52,860
You're a warm person.

900
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:59,360
And you're a good person.

901
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:21,960
<i>[Winter, Two Years Ago]</i>

902
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:24,160
Oh, Bo Ra's coming.

903
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:25,960
School's over, Bo Ra?

904
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:27,060
Hello.

905
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:29,960
Go inside.
Your mother should be there.

906
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:30,960
Okay.

907
01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:52,160
Hey, just cry.

908
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:56,060
Don't hold it in,
and just cry.

909
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:04,160
At times like this, you're supposed
to just let it out, Sun Woo.

910
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:10,660
It's okay.
You can cry.

911
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:46,860
Hey.
Something's falling.

912
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:56,760
It's raining, Sun Woo.
Let's go inside.

913
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:59,860
I really hate getting caught in the rain.

914
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:02,760
Bo Ra.

915
01:03:03,460 --> 01:03:06,460
Why are your hands so cold?

916
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,960
Because my heart is warm.

917
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:13,260
People with warm hearts have cold hands.

918
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:15,460
Let's go.

919
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:46,660
Coffee.

920
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:50,960
What about yours?

921
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:53,060
I only had enough money for one.

922
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:56,860
Um, Sun Woo...

923
01:03:56,860 --> 01:03:59,260
I won't tell anyone else about this.

924
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:02,160
How did you read my mind?

925
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:05,860
I'm very interested in you,
that's why.

926
01:04:05,860 --> 01:04:06,860
Hey.

927
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:10,860
I'm not in the mood for jokes right now.

928
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:23,960
But... what happened to your hand?

929
01:04:25,460 --> 01:04:26,560
Oh.

930
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,360
I tripped.

931
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:34,360
Geez. Way to go, you klutz.

932
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:48,360
Ouch.

933
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:52,960
Doesn't it hurt?

934
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:59,160
I'll... go on ahead.

935
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:37,160
Oh, thank you for your hard work.
Where are my children?

936
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:39,460
Duk Seon!

937
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:41,560
Mom!

938
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:44,060
Are you hurt anywhere?

939
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:46,160
Oh my... my child.

940
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:47,960
What happened to you?

941
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:50,560
Oh my!
It must have hurt so much!

942
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:52,560
Who did this to you?
Huh?

943
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:56,460
It was you?

944
01:05:56,460 --> 01:05:58,260
You hit my Duk Seon?

945
01:05:58,260 --> 01:05:59,760
I got hit too, lady!

946
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:01,960
How dare you look an adult in the eyes?

947
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:07,460
And what are you doing here?

948
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:10,460
She's No Eul's girlfriend.
He must be out of his mind.

949
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:12,160
What did you say?
Sung No Eul!

950
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:17,460
Geez... just look at this girl's head.

951
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:19,760
Who, in their right mind,
would take her for a high schooler?

952
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:22,460
What's it to you, lady?

953
01:06:22,460 --> 01:06:25,860
Wow... and just look at how she talks.
What is the world coming to?

954
01:06:25,860 --> 01:06:27,660
How in the world
did your parents raise you?

955
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:34,460
Excuse me!
May we go now? I have to feed my kids.

956
01:06:34,460 --> 01:06:36,060
I'm hungry, Mom.

957
01:06:36,060 --> 01:06:37,060
You are, right?

958
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:38,560
That student's parents have to come too.

959
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:42,260
Both parents have to come and sign this
for them to be able to leave.

960
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:51,860
Oh my... look at her mother.
What's with her?

961
01:06:51,860 --> 01:06:53,960
It's probably her stepmother.

962
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:55,960
I'm sorry.
I just got out of work.

963
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:58,660
I'm very sorry.
I'm Soo Kyung's guardian.

964
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:02,660
What's your relationship with her,
exactly?

965
01:07:02,660 --> 01:07:04,660
I'm Soo Kyung's older sister.

966
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:05,660
What about your parents?

967
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:10,760
Our parents...
passed away last year in a car accident.

968
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,460
She lives with me now.

969
01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:13,960
Oh... I see.

970
01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:18,260
It was just a fight between kids,
so you don't need to worry too much.

971
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:20,960
Please sign here and take her home.

972
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:21,960
Yes.

973
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:24,960
I'm sorry.

974
01:07:29,660 --> 01:07:31,260
I'm sorry.

975
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:32,960
Get up.

976
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:38,160
I'm really sorry.
I should have taught her better.

977
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:40,160
I'm very sorry.

978
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:43,760
Oh... no... it's fine.
We're sorry.

979
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:48,160
She's actually a good kid, but
after our parents passed away last year

980
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:50,260
she hasn't been able to
deal with it properly, it seems.

981
01:07:50,260 --> 01:07:51,460
I'm sorry.

982
01:07:51,460 --> 01:07:53,260
She really is a good kid.

983
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:54,460
She's really not like this
on the inside.

984
01:07:54,460 --> 01:07:57,160
What the hell are you saying?
Stop it, already!

985
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:58,260
Shut your mouth.

986
01:07:58,260 --> 01:07:59,960
You did nothing right!

987
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:01,760
- Hurry up and apologize!
- I don't want to.

988
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:02,760
Hey!

989
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:04,660
Oh... oh, it's okay.

990
01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:06,560
My kid did nothing right, either.

991
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:10,660
Geez... I didn't even know,
and you have red hair and all...

992
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:12,460
So I misjudged you.

993
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:14,360
Oh... my hair?

994
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:17,160
I'm attending cosmetology school.

995
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:20,660
I'm practicing right now, so my hair
and makeup are a bit over the top.

996
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:21,660
I'm sorry.

997
01:08:21,660 --> 01:08:22,660
Oh, I see.

998
01:08:22,660 --> 01:08:24,960
Someone between us
has to earn some money, so...

999
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:29,760
Oh, I didn't even know that,
and... geez.

1000
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:31,060
I'm sorry.

1001
01:08:31,060 --> 01:08:32,860
Oh, geez!

1002
01:08:32,860 --> 01:08:35,360
You have such a great personality.

1003
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:39,760
So you two can live on well then,
since you seem so dependable.

1004
01:08:40,260 --> 01:08:42,860
Who was it? Huh?

1005
01:08:42,860 --> 01:08:44,860
Who laid their hand on
my precious daughter?

1006
01:08:44,860 --> 01:08:46,060
Huh?

1007
01:08:48,860 --> 01:08:51,660
Duk Seon! Are you okay?
Huh?

1008
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:53,760
Oh, look here.

1009
01:08:56,660 --> 01:09:02,660
Look at your damn hair.
You two did it, didn't you?

1010
01:09:02,660 --> 01:09:04,360
You two must have done it.

1011
01:09:04,860 --> 01:09:10,760
You two really look like a pair of
disgustingly delinquent punks, too!

1012
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:13,560
How could two girls pick up
such bad mannerisms

1013
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:15,460
and beat up
someone else's precious child?

1014
01:09:15,460 --> 01:09:17,860
Are you two gangsters?
Or part of a crime syndicate?

1015
01:09:17,860 --> 01:09:20,960
Did your mother and father
teach you to act like that?

1016
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:25,160
Do your parents even know
you're living like this? Huh?

1017
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:27,160
How dare you two...

1018
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:29,060
Huh?

1019
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:32,460
Honey.
When did you get here?

1020
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:36,160
It seems that these two girls' parents
haven't come yet.

1021
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:40,760
I'm curious as to why they're fine with
letting their kids be such thugs.

1022
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:43,360
Shut your mouth already!
You're so annoying!

1023
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:46,060
And that's the end of the
formal speech saga.

1024
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:50,260
Their parents passed away
in a car accident last year.

1025
01:09:50,260 --> 01:09:53,960
And the older sister's hair is like that
because she goes to cosmetology school.

1026
01:09:54,460 --> 01:09:56,860
And Duk Seon is the one
who started it in the first place!

1027
01:09:56,860 --> 01:10:00,660
What the hell are you blabbing on about
when you don't even know their situation?

1028
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:02,360
What do you mean, "blabbing... on"?

1029
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:04,160
What the hell do you think?

1030
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:07,160
You can't think clearly
without cooling your head, all right?

1031
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:09,560
Jesus... how the hell can you
speak like that to your husband?

1032
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:13,660
I guess you really must love to
humiliate your husband in public!

1033
01:10:13,660 --> 01:10:16,960
Want to go for round two right here?
Huh? Damn it!

1034
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,660
You're so damn loud!

1035
01:10:18,660 --> 01:10:20,460
Be quiet, please!

1036
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:22,360
What are you doing,
in front of these kids?

1037
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:24,960
- Yes... Sir.
- I'm sorry.

1038
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:26,260
Um, Sir.

1039
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:28,360
I'm truly sorry.

1040
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:30,960
I'll teach her to be better from now on.

1041
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,160
I'm really sorry.

1042
01:10:33,260 --> 01:10:35,860
Oh, oh, oh...
no need for that!

1043
01:10:35,860 --> 01:10:39,460
I didn't even know anything, and I...
I'm the one who's sorry.

1044
01:10:39,460 --> 01:10:41,360
Oh my...

1045
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:42,960
You bastard!

1046
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:45,160
What were you doing while
your sister was getting in trouble?

1047
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:49,860
Hello, there.
Who's the captain here?

1048
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:55,860
Bring them here!

1049
01:10:55,860 --> 01:10:59,060
I'm the dean at Ssangmun High

1050
01:10:59,060 --> 01:11:04,460
and I heard that Ms. Sung Duk Seon was
badly assaulted by some shady characters.

1051
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:07,860
So I came here to deliver
some divine justice.

1052
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:11,860
What is this?
Who called Dong Ryong's father here?

1053
01:11:11,860 --> 01:11:15,060
Um... I felt a bit nervous
on my way here from the bank

1054
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:17,660
and Dong Ryong's dad said he knew
a lot of people in law enforcement

1055
01:11:17,660 --> 01:11:18,860
so I made a small request...

1056
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:21,160
Oh my God... what am I going to do?

1057
01:11:24,830 --> 01:11:28,360
Offending the other person's appearance,
their hair, and physical violence!

1058
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:31,960
With all these offenses, we have
more than enough to put you behind bars!

1059
01:11:34,860 --> 01:11:39,260
Student, consider your life
officially over.

1060
01:11:39,260 --> 01:11:40,660
Please, stop it already...

1061
01:11:40,660 --> 01:11:42,360
And of course,
your expulsion is a given.

1062
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:47,260
Mr. Sung.
No need for such deep sighs.

1063
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:49,960
I have, with me here, an inspector.

1064
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:52,260
He's my friend,
Detective Kim.

1065
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:53,260
Say hello.

1066
01:11:53,260 --> 01:11:54,660
Hello!

1067
01:11:58,460 --> 01:12:00,260
Bring the police captain
out here, already!

1068
01:12:00,260 --> 01:12:03,260
I'm going to have a nice
one-on-one chat with him.

1069
01:12:03,260 --> 01:12:05,160
You two are dead today.

1070
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:08,460
Goddammit... stop it, already!

1071
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:10,160
Please, stop it, already!

1072
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:13,260
I'm so sorry.

1073
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:18,060
I'm extremely sorry
for the inconvenience.

1074
01:12:23,060 --> 01:12:25,160
Then, I'll be off now.

1075
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:27,860
Oh, um... Inspector.

1076
01:12:27,860 --> 01:12:32,360
Thank you so much for coming
all the way here, in person.

1077
01:12:33,860 --> 01:12:35,460
This man isn't an inspector.

1078
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:36,460
Excuse me?

1079
01:12:36,460 --> 01:12:38,260
He's the principal of our school.

1080
01:12:39,460 --> 01:12:41,560
His name is Kim Gum Sa. (Inspector Kim)

1081
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:46,360
Your younger sibling's name is
Kim Pan Sa, right? (Judge Kim)

1082
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:49,960
And what was your
younger sister's name, again?

1083
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:51,960
Kim Jip Sa. (Deaconess Kim)

1084
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:55,760
Then, we'll be going now.

1085
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:04,560
Geez... he really does have a family
full of law enforcement officers.

1086
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:10,260
I always wondered who Dong Ryong
took after. He's just like his dad.

1087
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:14,460
I'm hungry.

1088
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:15,460
Me too.

1089
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:19,060
You are, right? Let's go home.
I made doenjang soup.

1090
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:21,060
Goodbye.

1091
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:27,060
Um, then... we'll also be leaving.

1092
01:13:27,660 --> 01:13:29,560
Come eat at our place.

1093
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:33,960
Our house is right around here.
We can have dinner together.

1094
01:13:34,460 --> 01:13:36,360
No, thanks.

1095
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:39,660
Hey, don't act all high and mighty.
Just come.

1096
01:13:39,660 --> 01:13:40,960
I'm so hungry, I could die.

1097
01:13:44,260 --> 01:13:48,060
All right!
It's not too good, right?

1098
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:51,660
No, it's delicious! It's the first time
in a while we've eaten like this.

1099
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:53,760
We only ever eat ramen.

1100
01:14:05,860 --> 01:14:08,660
Hey.
What the hell are you doing?

1101
01:14:08,660 --> 01:14:10,260
All right, all right.

1102
01:14:13,260 --> 01:14:14,460
Hey.

1103
01:14:14,460 --> 01:14:16,260
What did you use to dye your hair?

1104
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:17,660
This?

1105
01:14:17,660 --> 01:14:19,460
No way you did that with beer.

1106
01:14:19,460 --> 01:14:20,660
Hydrogen peroxide.

1107
01:14:20,660 --> 01:14:23,160
Hydrogen peroxide? You can't
get that kind of color with that.

1108
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:25,460
Three times.
You have to do it three times.

1109
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:27,160
And you need to
give it sunlight for one hour.

1110
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:28,160
Oh...

1111
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:33,060
Damn girl...

1112
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:35,260
Fix that hair color of yours first!

1113
01:14:35,260 --> 01:14:38,760
If you don't, I'll shave it all off
and ship you off to a monastery.

1114
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:40,460
Why are you only saying that to me?

1115
01:14:41,260 --> 01:14:43,560
And you too, Soo Kyung!

1116
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:45,160
What's with that hair of yours?

1117
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:47,660
You have that beautiful hair
your parents left you

1118
01:14:47,660 --> 01:14:50,360
so why did you dip-dye it like that?

1119
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:54,860
And take off that
ghoulish-looking makeup!

1120
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:58,760
And wear nice clothes,
suitable for a student! Got it?

1121
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:01,060
I'm going to check on you
once a week!

1122
01:15:01,060 --> 01:15:02,260
Got that?

1123
01:15:03,260 --> 01:15:04,460
Yes.

1124
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:09,260
We'll have to move.

1125
01:15:12,060 --> 01:15:14,460
Um... I'd like more rice.

1126
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:15,460
Oh, sure.

1127
01:15:15,460 --> 01:15:18,160
- No, I'll do it.
- No, no.

1128
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:29,460
Hey, you...
why do you like No Eul, anyway?

1129
01:15:29,460 --> 01:15:31,260
- Big Sis!
- Shut it!

1130
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:35,560
With a face like yours,
you could do a lot better.

1131
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:37,360
You have really low standards.

1132
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:41,360
He was the first one.

1133
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:46,160
What do you mean?
First what?

1134
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:48,260
The first one who told me
not to smoke.

1135
01:15:49,860 --> 01:15:53,460
He's the first one who
ever said that to me.

1136
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:04,760
After my parents passed away last year,
people only said nice things to me.

1137
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:08,560
Things like, "It's okay"
or "Everything's fine."

1138
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:09,960
Or, that anything I did was okay.

1139
01:16:12,460 --> 01:16:15,360
But No Eul was the first one to
get mad at me and bitch me out.

1140
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:16,860
And he was doing it earnestly, too.

1141
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:22,760
I was really thankful for that.

1142
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:45,760
Honey.

1143
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:48,260
Go sign the surgery consent form.

1144
01:16:49,060 --> 01:16:50,660
Okay.
Let's go together.

1145
01:16:50,660 --> 01:16:53,360
We don't both need to go.
Go by yourself.

1146
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:55,460
Okay.
Got it.

1147
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:04,860
Hurry up and go to sleep.
Your surgery is tomorrow.

1148
01:17:04,860 --> 01:17:06,460
I can't fall asleep.

1149
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:10,460
And why not?
Huh?

1150
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:14,860
Are you scared?

1151
01:17:17,060 --> 01:17:18,360
A little bit.

1152
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:22,760
Jung Bong.

1153
01:17:23,260 --> 01:17:26,760
I asked all the nurses here
this afternoon

1154
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:30,860
whether or not there's a chance
that the surgery won't go well.

1155
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:33,960
They said that there's
no chance at all. Really.

1156
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:36,160
Have you ever seen me lie?

1157
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:44,160
Also... I had ribs
with your dad for dinner.

1158
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:47,860
Do you think I'd be able to
eat out if I were worried?

1159
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:53,260
Neither of us are worried at all.

1160
01:17:56,160 --> 01:18:05,560
So... don't you worry either.
Hurry and get a good night's rest, okay?

1161
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:10,960
What's wrong, my son?

1162
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:14,360
You handled that other huge surgery
so well, too.

1163
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:23,860
You're a strong person, Mom.

1164
01:18:28,860 --> 01:18:35,560
You're a strong person,
but your son has such a weak body...

1165
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:39,360
and such a weak heart.

1166
01:18:44,660 --> 01:18:46,860
Why is my child weak?

1167
01:18:46,860 --> 01:18:50,660
You have so much strength,
because you take after me.

1168
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:55,360
Do you think just anyone overcomes
such a difficult surgery, like you did?

1169
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:57,160
Jung Bong.

1170
01:18:58,160 --> 01:19:00,660
That, in and of itself,
is an amazing feat.

1171
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:08,660
You're a much stronger and greater
person that I am, honey.

1172
01:19:16,260 --> 01:19:19,660
Hurry and go to sleep.
I'm going to go watch some TV.

1173
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:49,760
What are you doing over there?

1174
01:20:51,860 --> 01:20:53,460
Oh... Doctor.

1175
01:20:55,660 --> 01:20:57,860
Why are you still up?

1176
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:02,160
I was watching some TV.

1177
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:17,160
Ma'am.

1178
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:18,760
You don't need to worry.

1179
01:21:19,460 --> 01:21:21,660
It's a very simple
surgical procedure.

1180
01:21:21,660 --> 01:21:23,860
It's quite easy.

1181
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:28,360
It won't even take an hour, and it has
almost no risk factors whatsoever.

1182
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:31,960
So please don't worry,
and go to sleep.

1183
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:44,760
Thank you.

1184
01:21:46,060 --> 01:21:49,860
I... I just...

1185
01:21:51,260 --> 01:21:53,460
What's come over you?

1186
01:21:53,460 --> 01:21:55,760
You seemed to
bear it all so well up until now.

1187
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:02,960
But, um... it's really nothing
to cry over.

1188
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,960
It really won't take that long.

1189
01:22:05,460 --> 01:22:08,660
I'll make sure to
finish it within an hour.

1190
01:22:15,460 --> 01:22:17,260
Oh my.

1191
01:22:17,260 --> 01:22:19,960
You must have been
so worried up until now.

1192
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:23,260
It's almost all over now.

1193
01:22:23,260 --> 01:22:24,960
You just have to overcome this one thing.

1194
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:01,360
<i>[Korean University Hospital]</i>

1195
01:23:21,260 --> 01:23:22,960
Oh, Doctor.

1196
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:25,460
It ended without a hitch.

1197
01:23:25,460 --> 01:23:27,160
- Oh...
- Thank you.

1198
01:23:27,860 --> 01:23:31,060
Thankfully, we adjusted the location
and he didn't lose too much blood.

1199
01:23:31,060 --> 01:23:34,160
Thank you so much, Doctor.
You've worked so hard!

1200
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:36,760
You won't need to see me for some time.

1201
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:38,660
I'll see you again
in ten years.

1202
01:23:38,660 --> 01:23:39,760
Thank you so much.

1203
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:43,660
- Thank you so much!
- You've worked so hard, Sir!

1204
01:24:08,260 --> 01:24:09,860
Mr. Kim Jung Bong.

1205
01:24:09,860 --> 01:24:11,760
Mr. Kim Jung Bong?

1206
01:24:12,460 --> 01:24:14,560
Yes... he's almost completely
conscious now.

1207
01:24:18,660 --> 01:24:19,760
Jung Bong.

1208
01:24:20,660 --> 01:24:22,860
Jung Bong.
It's me, Mom.

1209
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:27,460
Your surgery went well!

1210
01:24:28,460 --> 01:24:30,660
What a relief...

1211
01:24:31,460 --> 01:24:33,360
You've worked hard.

1212
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:34,660
You've worked so hard.

1213
01:24:38,860 --> 01:24:42,560
I'm so sorry that I couldn't
give birth to you as a healthy child.

1214
01:24:47,160 --> 01:24:49,360
Why are you crying again?

1215
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:54,560
Jung Bong!
They said your surgery went really well!

1216
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:56,060
You don't need to worry!

1217
01:24:56,060 --> 01:24:58,260
They said that everything is fine now!
Okay?

1218
01:25:06,460 --> 01:25:08,060
Jung Hwan.

1219
01:25:10,460 --> 01:25:12,060
Jung Hwan.

1220
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:14,860
Yeah, Big Bro?

1221
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:16,660
Your... nose...

1222
01:25:16,660 --> 01:25:17,760
Huh?

1223
01:25:20,060 --> 01:25:22,160
Your... nose...

1224
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:23,160
Huh?

1225
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:29,260
Is your nose okay?

1226
01:25:35,260 --> 01:25:37,760
Damn it... what the hell?

1227
01:25:40,460 --> 01:25:42,960
<i>One's feelings can be put into words.</i>

1228
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:46,860
<i>That's why just one remark
can give off warmth.</i>

1229
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:54,260
<i>In this cold, harsh world,
the thing that allows one</i>

1230
01:25:54,260 --> 01:25:57,660
<i>to recognize the warmth that is present
in life, and makes it worth living</i>

1231
01:25:57,660 --> 01:26:02,160
<i>is not a wise saying,
or a refined, witty remark.</i>

1232
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:06,660
<i>Rather, it is one warm remark filled
with one's raw, unrefined feelings.</i>

<i>[Brazil Ddukbokki]</i>

1234
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:23,460
Hey. Do you have a hole in your chin?

1235
01:26:23,460 --> 01:26:25,460
Why do you keep spilling food
all over the place?

1236
01:26:25,460 --> 01:26:27,460
Ew!

1237
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:30,660
But, um... Big Sis.

1238
01:26:30,660 --> 01:26:32,760
Who do you think took
Mom's 30,000 won, that time?

1239
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:34,260
How did you know about that?

1240
01:26:34,260 --> 01:26:36,360
I heard from Bo Ra.

1241
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:37,660
It wasn't you?

1242
01:26:37,660 --> 01:26:39,760
Are you out of your mind?

1243
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:42,160
Dad gives me plenty of allowance.

1244
01:26:42,860 --> 01:26:43,960
Really?

1245
01:26:44,460 --> 01:26:46,160
Who could it have been, then?

1246
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:50,560
It wasn't Sung Bo Ra, or you.

1247
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:52,360
Or me.
Then...

1248
01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:49,460
Just a moment.

1249
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:52,660
<i>[November 2015]</i>

1250
01:27:52,910 --> 01:27:54,210
Who is it?

1251
01:27:54,210 --> 01:27:56,010
It's me, No Eul.

1252
01:27:56,010 --> 01:27:57,110
Okay!

1253
01:27:57,110 --> 01:27:58,310
No Eul's here?

1254
01:27:58,310 --> 01:28:00,610
Yeah. I told him I'd give him
some red ginseng.

1255
01:28:00,610 --> 01:28:01,710
Oh.

1256
01:28:01,710 --> 01:28:05,710
What took you so long?
Were you playing baseball again?

1257
01:28:05,710 --> 01:28:07,010
Big Sis!

1258
01:28:10,210 --> 01:28:12,010
Oh, Brother-in-Law.
Long time, no see.

1259
01:28:12,010 --> 01:28:14,010
Yeah.
Come on in.

1260
01:28:14,010 --> 01:28:16,310
Hey... how is it that you look
younger by the day?

1261
01:28:16,310 --> 01:28:18,010
What are you saying?

1262
01:28:18,010 --> 01:28:19,910
It must be tough,
living with my Big Sis.

1263
01:28:19,910 --> 01:28:21,510
Oh, please.

1264
01:28:21,510 --> 01:28:26,410
Hey... what's with your foot?
Did you get hurt?

1265
01:28:26,410 --> 01:28:28,010
Someone must have stepped
on his foot during baseball.

1266
01:28:28,010 --> 01:28:29,010
It looks like it hurts.

1267
01:28:29,010 --> 01:28:31,510
Oh, I'm fine.
Big Sis, give me my red ginseng already.

1268
01:28:31,510 --> 01:28:33,310
I left my car outside
without parking properly.

1269
01:28:33,310 --> 01:28:35,010
Big Sis.
Where are you going?

1270
01:28:35,010 --> 01:28:37,010
Who was it?
Lead the way!

1271
01:28:37,010 --> 01:28:39,210
How could they do this
to your foot?

1272
01:28:39,210 --> 01:28:43,410
Come on, Big Sis!
I'm not a little kid!

1273
01:28:43,410 --> 01:28:45,110
Do something
about that temper of yours.

1274
01:28:45,110 --> 01:28:47,510
How is it that your temper
has gotten worse than Bo Ra's?

1275
01:28:48,210 --> 01:28:50,010
Are you really okay?

1276
01:28:50,010 --> 01:28:51,010
Yeah.

1277
01:28:51,510 --> 01:28:53,410
Shouldn't he see a doctor, or something?

1278
01:28:53,410 --> 01:28:56,010
Oh, he definitely should.
Looks like he needs surgery right now.

1279
01:28:56,010 --> 01:28:58,610
I'll bet it'll take three whole hours
to recover from this.

1280
01:28:59,610 --> 01:29:02,310
Do you still see me as
seventeen years old, and in high school?

1281
01:29:02,310 --> 01:29:04,210
I'm turning 48 this year!

1282
01:29:04,710 --> 01:29:07,910
To me, you'll always be a high schooler.

1283
01:29:07,910 --> 01:29:09,010
Got it?

1284
01:29:09,310 --> 01:29:11,310
Okay, Big Sis.

1285
01:29:11,310 --> 01:29:13,310
How is it that you never seem
to get any older?

1286
01:29:13,310 --> 01:29:14,710
You look exactly the same
as when you were younger!

1287
01:29:15,410 --> 01:29:17,910
And how is it that you just
seem to get older and older?

1288
01:29:17,910 --> 01:29:20,910
He finally looks his age, is all!

1289
01:29:20,910 --> 01:29:23,210
It took me ten years to speak
informally to this punk.

1290
01:29:23,210 --> 01:29:26,510
Shut it.
He's still a kid to me.

1291
01:29:26,510 --> 01:29:28,210
As if.
He's like... 70.

1292
01:29:28,210 --> 01:29:30,210
I said shut it!
The kid will hear.

1293
01:29:30,710 --> 01:29:32,210
I already heard it all, though.

1294
01:29:32,710 --> 01:29:34,810
Don't listen to evil things, my child.

1295
01:29:36,310 --> 01:29:37,710
- Okay.
- Only listen to good things, okay?

1296
01:29:37,710 --> 01:29:38,710
Okay.

1297
01:29:38,710 --> 01:29:40,610
I won't.
I can't hear anything.

1298
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:43,110
<i>I haven't seen Jung Bong lately.
Did he go somewhere?</i>

1299
01:29:43,110 --> 01:29:44,110
<i>He went to a Buddhist temple.</i>

1300
01:29:44,110 --> 01:29:45,710
<i>Why, is he sick again?</i>

1301
01:29:45,710 --> 01:29:46,710
<i>Whoa!</i>

1302
01:29:48,010 --> 01:29:50,410
<i>Oh my.
She really has no fear.</i>

1303
01:29:50,410 --> 01:29:53,310
<i>Bo Ra... will be fine, right?</i>

1304
01:29:56,110 --> 01:29:58,210
<i>How dare you use
informal speech with me?</i>

1305
01:29:58,210 --> 01:29:59,210
<i>Do you know me?
Huh?</i>

1306
01:29:59,210 --> 01:30:01,210
<i>Hello?
Who is it?</i>

1307
01:30:01,710 --> 01:30:02,710
<i>Bo Ra.</i>

1308
01:30:02,710 --> 01:30:05,010
<i>Are... are you okay?</i>

1309
01:30:08,710 --> 01:30:09,810
<i>Oh, geez!</i>

1310
01:30:09,810 --> 01:30:12,410
<i>There's no set order
when it comes to dying.</i>

1311
01:30:12,410 --> 01:30:17,710
<i>Oh my god... what'll we do?
How could this have happened?</i>

1312
01:30:17,710 --> 01:30:21,610
<i>Isn't this world
just way too unfair?</i>

1313
01:30:21,610 --> 01:30:23,610
<i>They said they'll raise them.</i>

1314
01:30:23,610 --> 01:30:25,910
<i>How am I supposed to live now?</i>

1315
01:30:26,410 --> 01:30:28,710
<i>Then come eat with us,
at my place.</i>

1316
01:30:28,710 --> 01:30:30,810
<i>Okay.
Give that here.</i>

1317
01:30:30,810 --> 01:30:33,410
<i>Taek likes Duk Seon.</i>

1318
01:30:33,410 --> 01:30:35,610
<i>It has to go well.</i>

1319
01:30:35,910 --> 01:30:38,810
<i>What the...
so it's first love, huh?</i>

1320
01:30:39,710 --> 01:30:41,810
<i>What would you do without me?</i>

1321
01:30:43,610 --> 01:30:45,210
<i>Taek!</i>
