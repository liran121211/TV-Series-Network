Hey. We have two whole months left.
Worry about yourselves.

11
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:17,070
Even if you get everything else wrong
you really have to get this right.

12

Why are you here? You didn't
go to picket girl practice?

16
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:36,970
What about you guys?
What brings you guys all the way here?

17
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,570
Hey. Our school is closer than yours.

18
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,570
- Jung Hwan, I'm ordering ddukbokki, too.
- Okay.

19
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,470
Miss! Three servings of
ddukbokki too, please!

20
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:44,170
Jung Hwan, we're getting some too, then.

21
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,070
- Hey!
- That means it's okay.

22
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:48,570
Miss, give us some more ddukbokki, too!

23
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,570
Hey, Duk Seon,
can you pass me the water?

24
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:51,570
Sure.

25
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,070
I guess you don't have
picket girl practice today.

26
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,070
You pretty much live at the stadium.

27
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:00,070
I have to go after eating.
There's late practice today.

28
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,070
Hey, Special Unit.

29
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,070
Shut it. Who are you
calling Special Unit?

30
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,070
Even so, she turned right around,
didn't she?

31
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,570
Did you get a lot of practice in?

32
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,870
I heard that you guys were
doing that song by Sobangcha.

33
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,970
Yeah. When are you going to manage
to get that done?

34
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,270
I'm sure you're already so busy
with picket girl practice.

35
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:17,070
- The ramyun's done!
- Okay!

36
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,570
Duk Seon. Do you want some ramyun?
Want one?

37
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:25,570
- Hey!
- I'm not eating it! Damn.

38
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,610
Duk Seon, we'll be heading out first.
Jung Hwan covered everything.

39
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:38,110
- Just how much did she freaking eat?
- Hey, hey.

40
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,110
Bye.

41
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:50,310
You're not eating? It's free, though.

42
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:53,810
He's the Student Council President
at Ssangmun High, right?

43
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:57,310
Who, Sun Woo? The tall one? Why?

44
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,610
- What are you going to do?
- What?

45
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:07,010
It seems like he likes you.

46
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,310
He was only looking at you
from the moment he walked in.

47
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,810
I know, right? I saw it, too.

48
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:13,310
Why did he ask you to pass the water?

49
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,310
He could have just asked
the cook for it.

50
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:21,310
Also. Did you see his worried expression
when you said you had to practice?

51
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:25,250
- I totally saw it. Hey.
- I really saw it.

52
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:28,310
And the last piece
of decisive evidence...

53
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,310
"Do you want ramyun?"

54
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:48,310
Congrats, Duk Seon. You... just
got yourself a boyfriend.

60
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,310
Can you lend me some white-out?
You know, correction fluid.

61
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,810
White-out? I don't have any.

62
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,810
Way to go. What kind of student
doesn't even have white-out?

63
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,110
Hello.

64
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:41,510
Sun Woo, don't hang out with her.
You'll become stupid, too.

65
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:44,310
- Shut it!
- What did you say?

66
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:47,810
Hey, whatever. It's fine.
I'll just ask Jung Hwan. Bye.

67
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:52,120
- Goodbye.
- Okay... bye.

68
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,110
Eat up.

69
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:09,310
Is this the second Korean War
or something?

70
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:12,310
Why is it just "Potatoville" over here?

71
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,310
Are we on emergency rations
or something?

72
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,310
You're really going to be like this?

73
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,310
You bought an entire box
of potatoes yesterday.

74
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:20,310
Because you felt bad for
that guy's grandmother.

75
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:22,810
When did I ever? Why, I ought to...

76
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,310

77
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,310
Your dad is great
at acting, right?

78
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,310
Why do you keep using all the money?

79
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:38,310
I want to actually have some money
left over, for once! Stop using it all!

80
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,810
Not in front of the kids!

81
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:44,810
Also, do you know just how good
potatoes are for the body? Huh?

82
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:49,310
I bought it for our kids' health,
but you didn't even realize that?

83
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:52,010
Your hands are so strong
for no good reason.

84
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:58,310
By the way, Duk Seon. Isn't it time
for the Sports News? Turn on NBC.

85
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:04,810
- It's not time for the Sports News yet.
- Oh... really?

86
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:08,310
I really like that guy, Kang Sun Ho.

87
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:12,310
He looks like an actor and looks so tall!

88
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:15,310
Geez, you... All he does is
sit in that chair and blabber!

89
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:17,810

Sun Woo! Come in and have dinner with us!

101
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:51,970

for Sun Woo.

My... she was just there a second ago.
Where did she go?

103
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:02,810
- Wow... look at his face.
- He's totally shocked. Oh dear.

104
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:22,310
Wow... it's the first time I've seen
a live broadcast interrupted like that.

105

108
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,310
Yeah. Have something.

109
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:35,310
No, it's okay. I'm having ramyun
with the others at Taek's...

110
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:43,310
Jesus... you shocked me more
than the interruption on TV...

111
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:46,310
What the... where are you going
at this hour, with your face like that?

112
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,620

Why are you in such a rush?

169
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,310
You should hurry.

170
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:30,010
He has to finish up everything
before the kids get home, after all.

171
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:31,010
I'm sure he's excited.

172
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:33,810
What did you buy now, huh?

173
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:34,810
Eh?

174
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:35,810
They're bracken ferns.

175
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:38,410
They say that they're not good for
a man's sexual stamina, though.

176
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:39,950
Geez. How good must
his stamina be

177
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:42,330
if he's trying to get rid of
his excess stamina? Right?

178
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,810
I told you, let's talk inside.

179
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:46,810
And what's this, over here?

180
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:49,810
Wow... she's getting a head start, huh?

181
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:57,810
Damn it!

182
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:05,310
I don't know how they can stand to
chatter like that 365 days of the year!

183
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,810
I hate seeing them.
We have to move or something.

184
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,810
What the hell is all this?

185
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,310
Can't you tell just by looking at it?

186
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:12,810
They're greens.

187
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:15,810
I bought just a little
on the way home.

188
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:18,810
You call this "a little?" Huh?

189
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:19,810
Geez.

190
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:22,810
You know the paper store?

191
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:27,310
There's an old woman who sits in front
of that and sells greens all day.

192
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:29,810
And she looks just like my older sister.

193
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:32,310
She was squatting down there
and selling these

194
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:36,810
and she probably couldn't
sell all of these by the end of the day.

195
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:40,310
So how could I, as a human being,
just ignore that?

196
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:44,080
So... I just bought a couple.

197
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:50,310
Geez... these didn't even
cost that much!

198
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:54,140
People who are less fortunate
should help each other out!

199
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,810
We're not in the situation to be
helping other people right now.

200
00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:00,310
Because of your frivolous purchases,
I can't even buy things for the kids.

201
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:02,810
Just look. I have to live wearing
holey socks because of you!

202
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:05,810
Look, look! Take a good, hard, look!

203
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:10,810
What? I bet it's nice and cool,
you'll have more ventilation that way.

204
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:15,810
Geez! Are you seriously
saying that, right now?

205
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:19,310
Geez, it's always money with you.

206
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:22,010
With money, you'll never be satisfied
whether you have a lot or not!

207
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:25,310
You wouldn't know, since we've
never had money, would you?

208
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:29,810
- Damn it!
- You, really...

209
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,310
Which greens should I prep first?
Huh?

210
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:35,810
Two...

211
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:40,810
three...

212
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:48,310
four.

213
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,810
You thought that there was
only four, right?

214
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:57,810
Five.

215
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,810
Are you kidding me, right now?

216
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:04,310
There's four of us,
but you only bought five?

217
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:07,310
One person gets one each.
And you get two.

218
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:19,310
Honey. Please... let's start living
like people now, okay?

219
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:22,310
Let's use as much as other people
and live like other people live.

220
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:24,310
Okay, Mr. Kim Sung Kyun?

221
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:26,810
What's wrong with the way we live?

222
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:29,810
Three years ago,
we couldn't even have tangerines!

223
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:33,310
We used to live on boiled dough
because we had no money for rice!

224
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,010
Thinking of how I used to live back then

225
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:37,210
even buying these feels like
something out of a dream.

226
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,810
Again with that past crap!

227
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:43,360
If you like talking about it so much,
why don't you go back to those times?

228
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:46,810
Geez. You... geez.

229
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:50,310
Who cares if we have money?
You don't have a rich person's mindset.

230
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:54,810
I'm worried that our kids
will take after you!

231
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,810
What are you going to do about Jung Bong?

232
00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:00,810
He takes after you
so he's cowardly and miserly.

233
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:03,310
Do you think he'll actually
be able to function in society?

234
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,810
Aren't you even a little bit worried?

235
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,810
He'll change when he goes to college.

236
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:11,310
He has to study
to be able to go to college!

237
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,990
Lately he's been doing nothing
but studying in his room!

238
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:17,510
You want to make a bet?

239
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:02,810
See? You call that studying?

240
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:05,310
Are you studying right now?

241
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:07,310
No, Mother.

242
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:09,010
There's not much time left
until the exams.

243
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,610
Are you not planning to go to college?

244
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:15,310
President Roosevelt once said

245
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:20,280
"There's more to be learned from stamps
than from school."

246
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:29,310
And your mother once said this

247
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:31,310
"I've never seen
such a useless piece of shit!"

248
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:33,810
You motherf**cker!

249
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:36,810
You took exams for
five f**king years in a row... and what?

250
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:37,810
If you were of sound mind

251
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:40,350
you would have taken your mother
and father into consideration,

252
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:44,310
at least you should have buckled down
in front of your motherf**king desk

253
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:48,180
and studied your f**king brains out,
you immoral f**king dipshit!

254
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:55,310
All right.

255
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:58,810
What's so important about school?
Continue with what you were doing.

256
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,640
Yes, Mother.

257
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:14,960
There's a lot of greens,
so eat a lot of those.

258
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:20,310
You bastard... why do you
keep pushing the table?

259
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,310
I didn't.

260
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:25,810
Then would the table grow legs
and crawl toward me?

261
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:28,810
I can't move because
it's so close to my stomach!

262
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:32,310
Dad, can't you buy
me one of those?

263
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,310
Everyone in my class has one
except me.

264
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:39,310
Tsk... Your sister has one!
Share that!

265
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:43,580
- Mine broke. Buy me one, too.
- I guess I need to buy it then.

266
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:49,540
Whatever. I wasn't expecting
anything from you, anyway.

267
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:52,810
Have some greens. I bought them.

268
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:15,310
Hey. You got it wrong again.

269
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:17,810
No, I didn't! She did!

270
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:19,310
Crazy bitch.

271
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:22,810
Sung Duk Seon. I really don't think
you have a talent for dancing.

272
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,710
We've been practicing for months
and you can't get that one thing right?

273
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:28,310
- I only got it wrong once.
- You get it wrong every day.

274
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:31,310
How are you going to be able to perform
at the overnight trip, at this rate?

275
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,810
- We still have two days.
- Just drop out.

276
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:36,810
Why do you want to do the talent show
so badly when you can't even dance?

277
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:58,310
<i>[Announcement for home:

You guys don't need to worry.

282
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:10,310
I'm going to master it perfectly tonight.

283
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:12,310
How?

284
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:14,810
Don't you know that Park Nam Jung
lives in my neighborhood?

285
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:18,310
There's a guy in Ssangmundong we call
Park Nam Jung, who dances really well.

286
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:20,510
You probably saw him
at the ddukbokki place last time.

287
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,310
The one who had glasses on.

288
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,810
Oh. That guy.

289
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:27,310
He got first place once doing a
Park Nam Jung dance number.

290
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,310
It was this one.

291
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:35,810
<i>My dreams, which have been
broken into small pieces...</i>

292
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:41,810
<i>They scatter far, far away
into the sky...</i>

293
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,310
Damn it!

294
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,310
I told you, it's a Sobangcha song!

295
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,910
Who dances to Sobangcha songs anymore?

296
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:59,310
Everyone!

297
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:01,510
Come on. Stop messing around
and do "About Last Night."

298
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:06,140
That's way too basic. There isn't
anyone who can't dance to that!

299
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:09,810
Hey. Can you guys do it?

300
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:12,810
Us?

301
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:26,810
Damn it.

302
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:32,810
How many months
have you been at it, already?

303
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:36,110
I bet my dog would dance better than you
if it'd been practicing for three months.

304
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,310
Hey. We got first place
with this dance last year.

305
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:40,310
He does this dance
better than Dong Young does.

306
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:42,810
Geez... stop it. It's not like
that's anything impressive.

307
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:44,810
Go ahead and dance to it. I'll watch.

308
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,810
Yeah. Let's see how well you can do it.

309
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:49,310
If you shut him up, I'll dance.

310
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,810
Don't you say a word! Got it?

311
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:52,810
I can't even laugh?

312
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,310
No. Just go to sleep.

313
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,310
Satisfied? Dance now. I'll watch.

314
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,310
No!

315
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:09,810
Geez. So annoying.

316
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,810
Good! Keep going!

317
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:19,810
Okay, let's go.

318
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:26,310
One, two, three, four. Five,
six, seven... hey. No.

319
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:28,310
What are you doing?

320
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:29,810
Geez...

321
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:45,810
Am I that bad? I didn't
get any of it down?

322
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:47,810
Not a single move!

323
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:49,810
Geez! You got everything wrong!

324
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:51,810
Shut it!

325
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:54,310
Sun Woo, was it weird?
Did I get a lot wrong?

326
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:56,310
Yeah. I don't think
dancing is your thing.

327
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:58,310
It's not like she's good at
anything else.

328
00:21:58,810 --> 00:21:59,810
Duk Seon.

329
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:03,310
We'll save money and just buy you a MyMy.

330
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:06,310
No... ask Taek to buy you one.
I feel like I'm going to die.

331
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:09,310
No, Let's open the door. It's hot.

332
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,510
Oh... my God. You scared me.

333
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,810
You're home and you're still
playing Baduk?

334
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:15,810
Geez.

335
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:19,310
Taek! You should have said something
if you came home!

336
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:22,310
I've been craving ramyun
since a while ago.

337
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:24,310
Taek! Five ramyuns!

338
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:26,310
Hey, hey, hey! I'll make it!

339
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,910
Anyway, you don't know how to make it.

340
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:48,810
Hey, Il Hwa! Dong Il's here!
You know, your husband!

341
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:51,310
What the hell is that ruckus all about?

342
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:56,310
You went and bought something again.

343
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:59,310
Your hubby, Dong Il is here.

344
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,810
What the hell did you buy this time?

345
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:07,810
Ta-da!

<i>[Prenatal Baby Music]</i>

347
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:22,310
There are so many unfortunate people
living in this world.

348
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:27,310
Remember, the person who
got us insurance last summer?

349
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:29,810
You know, Dang Soo's cousin's
daughter's hometown friend.

350
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:34,310
She lost her husband at such a young age

351
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:36,410
and is raising a baby boy
that's about Jin Joo's age

352
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:39,310
and is suffering so much.

353
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:42,810
After hearing that,
I started to cry.

354
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:47,310
What is that?

355
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:53,310
Can't you tell by looking at it?
Pre... natal... you know...

356
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:56,460
Why? You want to have another kid even
though we're already having a hard time?

357
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:59,460
No... if she just sold one of these
she'd be able to have dinner, at least.

358
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,960
How could I ignore her, hearing that?

359
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,920
And on top of that, she's Dang Soo's
cousin's daughter's hometown friend!

360
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:08,590
- It's not like she's a stranger!
- She is a stranger!

361
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:12,950
<i>Come to your damn senses, already!
I can't live like this anymore!</i>

362
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:19,760
<i>Seoul is in shock after hearing
the news of the 12 convicts</i>

363
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,740
<i>who were to receive sentences
in the countryside, but fled.</i>

364

<i>Citizens are troubled by the fact

365
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,740

366
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:32,240
<i>But to day, the authorities apprehended
Kim Dong Yeon, who had escaped.</i>

367
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,240
Geez. What a world we live in...

368
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,740
I'm going to rip that up!

369
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,240
It's still wearable!

370
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,240
It doesn't have any holes or anything.

371
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,740
Who wears tanktops
until they get holes nowadays?

372
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,850
Throw that away immediately!

373
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:00,240
Do you know what
the scariest thing in the world is?

374
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,740
The fact that someone who has nothing
is trying to help others.

375
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,640
We're not well off enough
to be helping others!

376
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,740
Geez... you're always like this
about money!

377
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:09,740
- Have you gone mad?
- Oh my God.

378
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,740
Am I the one who is weird
in this situation?

379
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,240
Ask anyone.

380
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,340
Is the guy who has nothing who gives all
he has to other people the normal one

381
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:19,240
or is the one who's trying to feed
and raise her kids?

382
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,740
What's wrong with living in
this basement room, anyway?

383
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:23,740
What did you say?

384
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:26,740
It's cold in the summer and
warm in the winter, so it's great!

385
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,740
Oh! Fine!

386
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:32,240
If you're nice and cool,
live like this forever yourself.

387
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,240
I can't live like this anymore!

388
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:40,740
Also... do you even know about
Duk Seon's overnight trip?

389
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:45,020
How are we going to pay for that
with no money, huh?

390
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,740
We have to give her 20,000 won for that

391
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:51,240
but we only have 30,000 left
for the rest of this month!

392
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,240
What the hell are you going to
do about this? Huh? Tell me!

393
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,240
Geez... keep it short, already!

394
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,240
Where the hell are you going?

395
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,240
Where else?

396
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,240
To borrow money from Dang Soo's
cousin's daughter's hometown friend!

397
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,240
Oh, good...

398
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,740
Hey.

399
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,740
You guys are going on
an overnight trip tomorrow?

400
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:57,240
You remembered that?

401
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,740
I got this from your bag, Sun Woo.

402
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,440
We didn't have anything
to put the pot on.

403
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,440
That's fine.

404
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,740
Gyeongju, huh?

405
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,240
Your school, too?

406
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,240
Yeah. We're going
to Gyeongju, too.

407
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:17,240
You're kind of jealous, right?
That's why I told you not to quit school.

408
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,240
Who cares about quarterfinals?

409
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,240
Geez.

410
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,740
Jung Hwan.

411
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,240
Taek made 200 million won last year.

412
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,740
Even so, he'd probably
want to come to Gyeongju.

413
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,740
You've never been there, right?

414
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:31,740
Yeah.

415
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:35,240
Taek. Where's your match tomorrow, again?

416
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,240
Tokyo.

417
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:08,240
<i>Madam! I brought some potatoes.
You're not asleep yet, right?</i>

418
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,740
<i>Oh, come on in!</i>

419
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:19,740
Prenatal music tapes? Wow.

420
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:27,240
Geez. Who understands
how I feel right now?

421
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,240
Because of that, we had a huge fight.

422
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,740
Even thought he has no money,
he's the neighborhood philanthropist.

423
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:35,740
What can you do about the fact
that he's a good person?

424
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,740
I guess he felt really bad.

425
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:41,740
But he doesn't feel bad for his own kids?
Geez. So pathetic.

426
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,740
Even so, you're better off than me.

427
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:48,240
My husband still can't overcome
the mentality he had when he was poor.

428
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,240
Even if we have money, we can't use any.

429
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,740
It can't be helped.

430
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:58,240
He's the one who was the worst off among
any of us in the neighborhood long ago.

431
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,240
It's not like that he could forget
about living in poverty overnight.

432
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,240
I mean, if he'd already lived
like a poor man once

433
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,240
he should learn how to spend money now.

434
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:10,240
I'm so embarrassed by what other people
might think.

435
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:14,740
I'm sure he'll change, little by little.

436
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:18,740
He acquired that wealth overnight

437
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,740
so you can't expect him
to change that quickly.

438
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:24,240
Even so, you're the one
I'm most jealous of.

439
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:29,740
Wow... I wonder if I'll ever get to live
without worrying about money.

440
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:33,240
But, at any rate...
what brings you here so late?

441
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:41,740
Oh, um... that is...
it's, um... um...

442
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,740
What is it?

443
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,840
We're close enough that you should feel
comfortable asking me about anything.

444
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,740
Geez... I'm always indebted to you...

445
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,740
Madam. Um... can I...

446
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:54,240
It's because of the money
you borrowed before, right?

447
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,240
Geez.
It's fine! Give it to me next time.

448
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,740
You can pay me back slowly.

449
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,740
Money is no object for me, you know.

450
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,240
Geez. No need to worry so much.

451
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,240
What are you doing?

452
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,740
Oh... nothing. Nothing.

453
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:43,060
Is that money?

454
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,310
It's for school.
Money that was collected at school.

455
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,240
You sure collected a lot from your class.

456
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,740
You guys really must have
more than 70 kids in your class, huh?

457
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,740
Yeah.

458
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,740
Hey, be careful with that.

459
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:02,240
I heard about another kid
who got school funds stolen from him.

460
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,740
Oh... really? Yeah,
I'll be careful.

461
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,240
Go ahead and sleep, Duk Seon.

462
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,240
- I want to get some air.
- Okay.

463
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,740
What?

Go ahead and sleep.

00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,740
I'll give you five minutes

Five minutes, my ass.

00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:04,240
I don't know what I'll do
after the five minute mark.

471
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,740
Do you know how
the steel was tempered?

472
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,240
I'm not talking about what happened in

490
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,240
I'll bet they're delicious.

just watch.

00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:55,740
If I tell my dad,
he'll buy you one.

676
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,240
Shut it.

677
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:05,240
They said you can be discharged now.

678
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:07,740
Mi Ok. You can walk, right?

679
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:09,240
Yes.

680
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,740
You two... only stay at the
hostel from now on, all right?

681
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:14,240
You two are forbidden from leaving.

682
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:16,240
What about the talent show, Teacher?

683
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,740
They have to compete in the
talent show with me tomorrow!

684
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,640
Talent show, my ass.

685
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,640
In this state?

686
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:27,140
I heard you guys were doing
Sobangcha (Firetruck)?

687
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:29,240
You want to ride
an ambulance one more time, instead?

688
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:32,640
No, Teacher!
I really have to compete!

689
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,840
So I'm saying,
how are they going to compete like this?

690
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:41,210
At any rate, I won't un-register you so
give it your all on your own, Duk Seon.

691
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:45,640
- All I have to do is be on stage, right?
- Why?

692
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:48,480
Are you going to sing a song,
or something?

693
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,140
Okay. One, two, three!

695
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:47,140

698
00:54:15,390 --> 00:54:16,390
Hey, where are you going?

699
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:19,890
Sun Woo. Come over
here for a second.

700
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:20,890
Yes.

701
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,580
Hey, Kim Jung Hwan!

702
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:30,980
Hey, Kim Jung Hwan!

703
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:32,480
Hey!

704
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:37,900
What is that?

705
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:40,480
Hold onto this for us.
They're checking our bags soon.

706
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:41,480
Are you out of your mind?

707
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:44,140
At 12:00 a.m. come to
the steel gates... all right?

708
00:54:45,090 --> 00:54:47,690
If you don't come, you're dead,
and if you open that, you're dead.

709
00:54:47,690 --> 00:54:51,390
And if you lose it,
you're definitely dead.

710
00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:53,390
Hey! Kim Jung Hwan!

711
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:55,890
Jung Hwan! Hey!

712
00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:00,890
What are you doing?

713
00:55:01,390 --> 00:55:04,890
Dong Ryong! I'm so glad to see you!

714
00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:07,890
Wow...

715
00:55:13,390 --> 00:55:16,390
Just this once....
save me this once. Please?

716
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:19,890
Even so... how could I compete
in your school's talent show?

717
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:22,490
I heard that kids from your school
officially registered last year

718
00:55:22,490 --> 00:55:24,890
for our talent show
and they were allowed to perform!

719
00:55:24,890 --> 00:55:27,390
They even got second place
and won Gyeongju Bread!

720
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:29,690
Even so, no.

721
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:32,390
Dong Ryong! Bring the rest of them.
Please?

722
00:55:32,390 --> 00:55:34,890
Please? I need the MyMy!

723
00:55:34,890 --> 00:55:38,130
I said I can't. I'm allergic to girls.

724
00:55:43,390 --> 00:55:47,390
Among my friends, there's a girl
we call Wang Jo Hyun.

725
00:55:49,390 --> 00:55:54,390
Her real name is Wang Ja Hyun,
but she looks just like Joey Wang.

726
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:56,390
So we call her Joey Wang.

727
00:55:58,390 --> 00:56:02,890
There's one more. We
call her Maggie Cheung.

728
00:56:17,890 --> 00:56:19,890
<i>[Get well soon!]</i>

729
00:56:19,890 --> 00:56:23,390
<i>[Get well soon!
From the lovely Joey Wang.]</i>

730
00:56:24,690 --> 00:56:26,890
How am I going to get
that bastard over there, though?

731
00:56:26,890 --> 00:56:27,890
Who, Sun Woo?

732
00:56:27,890 --> 00:56:30,890
He's the Student Council President,
so he won't want to cause any trouble.

733
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:35,390
He'll come. Sun Woo will come.

734
00:56:35,390 --> 00:56:36,890
How do you know?

735
00:56:36,890 --> 00:56:39,890
Tell him that I requested it.
Throw me under the bus.

736
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:40,990
What are you talking about?

737
00:56:40,990 --> 00:56:45,390
- And tell Jung Hwan just one thing.
- What?

738
00:56:45,390 --> 00:56:48,390
- "Something Special."
- What?

739
00:56:48,390 --> 00:56:51,890
See you later. 9:00 p.m. at the metal
gates in front of the Kim Yu Shin Hostel!

740
00:56:53,890 --> 00:56:54,890
All right.

741
00:56:54,890 --> 00:56:56,390
Next up is...

742
00:56:56,390 --> 00:56:59,390
"Tonight, Her Eyes are Scarier."

743
00:56:59,890 --> 00:57:04,390
Ssangmun Girls' High's very own
Choi Jin Ah!

744
00:57:22,390 --> 00:57:24,390
I guess they're not coming.

745
00:57:25,390 --> 00:57:27,890
Duk Seon, just give it up.

746
00:57:27,890 --> 00:57:29,890
If it were me, I'd be
too embarrassed to come, too.

747
00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:35,890
They're here.

748
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:36,890
Over there.

749
00:57:43,890 --> 00:57:46,390
Hey, hey, come back here. Hey!

750
00:57:48,390 --> 00:57:50,790
The news casts a negative light on it

751
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:55,890
but honestly, there aren't any kids who
don't run "One-day cafes" nowadays.

752
00:57:55,890 --> 00:57:58,720
We ask the parents to come in
as a formality

753
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:01,890
but honestly, you don't need to worry.

754
00:58:01,890 --> 00:58:04,890
Even so, I'm truly sorry.

755
00:58:04,890 --> 00:58:07,890
I'm going to get No Eul
and really teach him a lesson.

756
00:58:07,890 --> 00:58:10,390
No, no. Don't do that, sir.

757
00:58:10,390 --> 00:58:12,490
No Eul is a good kid.
And he does well academically..

758
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:16,390
Just please direct him well
so that this doesn't happen again.

759
00:58:16,390 --> 00:58:17,890
Oh, also...

760
00:58:17,890 --> 00:58:23,390
since it's the rules, he'll be cleaning
bathrooms for the next 10 days.

761
00:58:23,390 --> 00:58:25,390
Please don't be too upset about that.

762
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:27,890
Oh, geez. Merely that won't suffice.

763
00:58:27,890 --> 00:58:31,890
Make him clean up after
everyone's poop or something.

764
00:58:32,390 --> 00:58:35,390
Um... it's about time for No Eul
to be finished with cleaning.

765
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:36,890
Please go home with him, sir.

766
00:58:37,390 --> 00:58:40,390
- Oh, Teacher... I'm so sorry.
- No, it's fine.

767
00:58:40,390 --> 00:58:41,890
- I'm so sorry.
- It's fine, really.

768
00:58:47,890 --> 00:58:48,890
Dad!

769
00:58:50,890 --> 00:58:52,390
Dad, I'm sorry. I won't do it again.

770
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:53,390
Okay? I promise.

771
00:58:53,390 --> 00:58:54,890
Please let me off the hook
this once.

772
00:58:55,390 --> 00:58:57,890
You idiot!

773
00:58:58,390 --> 00:59:00,890
Boys will be boys! Things happen!

774
00:59:00,890 --> 00:59:02,390
What are you apologizing for?

775
00:59:02,390 --> 00:59:06,890
It's fine! Relax your shoulders!
My darling child.

776
00:59:11,890 --> 00:59:17,390
Here. I caught a few goldfish
for my good son to eat.

777
00:59:17,390 --> 00:59:19,390
I already got all the bones out.

778
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:24,390
- Dad.
- No, it's okay.

779
00:59:28,890 --> 00:59:33,890
Anyway... about those kids who run
the "One-day cafe" with you...

780
00:59:33,890 --> 00:59:36,390
Are you guys really close?

781
00:59:36,390 --> 00:59:37,390
Sung No Eul!

782
00:59:37,390 --> 00:59:40,890
Yeah. I've been friends with
them since middle school.

783
00:59:41,390 --> 00:59:42,890
I'm sure you know them too.

784
00:59:42,890 --> 00:59:43,890
Tae Joo and Hong.

785
00:59:43,890 --> 00:59:44,890
- Oh yeah.
- No Eul!

786
00:59:44,890 --> 00:59:47,890
Wow... you're still
hanging out with them?

787
00:59:47,890 --> 00:59:51,080
Yeah. We're in different classes
but we see each other every day.

788
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:53,390
We eat lunch together, too.
And play soccer together.

789
00:59:53,390 --> 00:59:55,390
And sometimes study together, too.

790
00:59:56,890 --> 01:00:00,390
Oh yeah. Your mother must be waiting.
Let's go.

791
01:00:00,390 --> 01:00:01,890
- Okay.
- Hey!

792
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:02,890
Hey, Basement Room!

793
01:00:04,390 --> 01:00:05,890
Basement Room!

794
01:00:05,890 --> 01:00:07,390
Wait!

795
01:00:08,390 --> 01:00:09,890
- Hello.
- Hello.

796
01:00:09,890 --> 01:00:11,890
- Come over here.
- What the hell?

797
01:00:12,390 --> 01:00:14,390
Dad. Just a moment.

798
01:00:15,890 --> 01:00:20,390
- What are you eating?
- Want one?

799
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:21,890
My dad bought these goldfish breads.

800
01:00:25,390 --> 01:00:27,390
You're supposed to
eat these from the tail.

801
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:46,890
All right...
this is the last act for tonight.

802
01:00:52,390 --> 01:00:55,390
I'll read exactly as it says
on this.

803
01:00:55,890 --> 01:00:57,390
Contestant Number 10!

804
01:00:57,390 --> 01:01:02,390
From Ssangmun High School,
"About Last Night" by Sobangcha!

805
01:01:36,390 --> 01:01:41,390
Sobangcha! Sobangcha!

806
01:01:43,390 --> 01:01:46,890
<i>Last night, I didn't like you.</i>

807
01:01:49,390 --> 01:01:52,890
<i>Last night, I grew to hate you.</i>

808
01:01:54,890 --> 01:02:00,390
<i>As I stared at the spinning lights</i>

809
01:02:00,890 --> 01:02:04,390
<i>I faced heartache alone.</i>

810
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:15,890
<i>Why didn't my friends see
how miserable I looked...</i>

811
01:02:17,890 --> 01:02:28,390
<i>when I held your hand
and danced with you?</i>

812
01:02:28,390 --> 01:02:39,390
<i>The party last night
was so lonely.</i>

813
01:02:40,390 --> 01:02:43,390
<i>Even if I were to offer
the whole world to you</i>

814
01:02:43,390 --> 01:02:45,390
<i>nothing would change.</i>

815
01:02:45,890 --> 01:02:50,390
<i>Why don't you know that?</i>

816
01:02:51,890 --> 01:02:55,890
<i>Last night, I didn't like you.</i>

817
01:02:57,390 --> 01:03:01,390
<i>Last night, I grew to hate you.</i>

818
01:03:02,890 --> 01:03:08,390
<i>As I waited for
the unending music to end</i>

819
01:03:08,890 --> 01:03:13,390
<i>I was depressed by myself.</i>

820
01:03:18,390 --> 01:03:27,390
Sobangcha! Sobangcha!

821
01:03:45,890 --> 01:03:46,890
Hey, we're leaving now.

822
01:03:46,890 --> 01:03:48,890
Okay. Thanks, Sun Woo!

823
01:03:48,890 --> 01:03:50,590
You were the best!
You're really the best.

824
01:03:50,590 --> 01:03:51,690
You're that happy?

825
01:03:51,690 --> 01:03:53,890
You're probably going to get it taken
by Bo Ra anyway.

826
01:03:53,890 --> 01:03:55,590
Are you crazy?
Don't you dare tell anyone.

827
01:03:57,390 --> 01:03:58,390
Duk Seon.

828
01:03:58,390 --> 01:03:59,890
We have something to discuss, right?

829
01:04:02,890 --> 01:04:04,890
Guys, say hi.
These are my friends.

830
01:04:07,890 --> 01:04:08,890
- Hello.
- Hello.

831
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:14,390
This is Jang Mi Ok,
who we call Maggie Cheung.

832
01:04:14,890 --> 01:04:16,390
Yes... hello.

833
01:04:16,890 --> 01:04:19,390
And this is Wang Ja Hyun,
who we call Joey Wang.

834
01:04:19,390 --> 01:04:20,890
Hello.

835
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:22,390
Hello.

836
01:04:22,890 --> 01:04:24,390
What's your nickname then,
Duk Seon?

837
01:04:24,390 --> 01:04:25,390
Me?

838
01:04:25,390 --> 01:04:26,390
Lee Mi Yeon.

839
01:04:26,390 --> 01:04:27,890
- Oh.
- Want to be slapped?

840
01:04:28,390 --> 01:04:31,390
How could you defile the name
of Lee Mi Yeon like that?

841
01:04:32,390 --> 01:04:34,390
You saw each other at
the ddukbokki place, right?

842
01:04:34,390 --> 01:04:36,690
It's okay to use informal speech.
We're all the same age.

843
01:04:36,690 --> 01:04:37,890
Shall we, then?

844
01:04:37,890 --> 01:04:41,390
Hey. You were really
great at dancing.

845
01:04:41,390 --> 01:04:42,390
The best!

846
01:04:42,890 --> 01:04:46,390
Uh... no... I can't dance, ma'am.

847
01:04:46,390 --> 01:04:48,790
What are you talking about?
It's okay, use informal speech.

848
01:04:48,790 --> 01:04:50,390
You're "Park Nam Jung,"
right?

849
01:04:50,390 --> 01:04:51,390
Hey.

850
01:04:51,390 --> 01:04:53,890
You dance a lot better
than Park Nam Jung.

851
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:58,390
Oh, geez...
you've made a mistake. I apologize.

852
01:04:58,390 --> 01:05:01,390
I think it's time we went.
Hey guys, let's go.

853
01:05:01,390 --> 01:05:03,990
Duk Seon. You know that we have
something to discuss later, right?

854
01:05:03,990 --> 01:05:06,890
- Huh?
- Then... we must go. Guys, let's go.

855
01:05:09,890 --> 01:05:11,390
Hey, Duk Seon,
come here for a second.

856
01:05:11,390 --> 01:05:12,890
- Hey, talk on the way.
- Me?

857
01:05:17,390 --> 01:05:20,390
How the hell is she Joey Wang?

858
01:05:20,390 --> 01:05:23,390
Hey, but... we're really late
so we're probably going to get caught.

859
01:05:23,890 --> 01:05:25,690
And what was with
so-called "Maggie Cheung?"

860
01:05:25,690 --> 01:05:26,690
Whatever!

861
01:05:26,690 --> 01:05:28,890
- Hurry up and hand it over.
- What?

862
01:05:28,890 --> 01:05:32,390
- My liquor!
- Oh... yeah.

863
01:05:33,390 --> 01:05:34,390
Hey.

864
01:05:34,890 --> 01:05:37,890
The liquor... I definitely
had it this afternoon...

865
01:05:38,890 --> 01:05:41,390
I did have it until then...

866
01:05:43,390 --> 01:05:44,480
<i>See you later.</i>

867
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:46,920
At the gates in front of
the Kim Yu Shin Hostel!

868
01:05:47,890 --> 01:05:48,890
Huh?

869
01:05:48,890 --> 01:05:50,890
I think they're getting on the bus.

870
01:05:50,890 --> 01:05:52,390
Oh no! I'm off!

871
01:05:52,390 --> 01:05:53,390
Hey, wait up!

872
01:06:14,890 --> 01:06:17,390
Dammit!

873
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:20,890
I was the crazy bastard
for leaving it with you!

874
01:06:20,890 --> 01:06:22,890
It's the dean! Run!

875
01:06:23,390 --> 01:06:25,890
Huh? Isn't that Dong Ryong's dad?

876
01:06:25,890 --> 01:06:26,890
Teacher!

877
01:06:26,890 --> 01:06:28,390
Dong Ryong's father!

878
01:06:29,390 --> 01:06:30,590
Are you out of your damn mind?

879
01:06:31,890 --> 01:06:35,390
Stop right there, bastards!
You're not stopping?

880
01:06:35,390 --> 01:06:38,390
Stop right there, or I'll kill you!

881
01:06:52,390 --> 01:06:54,390
You're dead, you bastards!

882
01:06:57,390 --> 01:06:59,390
You bastards... hey!

883
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:00,390
You bastards!

884
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:10,970
Hey!

885
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:17,970
Hey!

886
01:07:18,310 --> 01:07:20,510
Good going, bastards!
You're in for a hefty punishment!

887
01:07:20,510 --> 01:07:24,810
That's what you get! Stay right there!

888
01:07:26,310 --> 01:07:27,810
Hey, are you okay? Huh?

889
01:07:30,810 --> 01:07:33,310
Damn... how is he so fast?

890
01:07:33,310 --> 01:07:34,310
Sun Woo.

891
01:07:35,810 --> 01:07:37,810
Do you have a blunt object?

892
01:07:38,810 --> 01:07:40,310
Why?

893
01:07:41,810 --> 01:07:43,810
Can you knock me out?

894
01:08:02,810 --> 01:08:06,310
- Hey, breathe a bit quieter!
- Hush!

895
01:08:26,810 --> 01:08:30,810
Let's hurry it up and go.
Go... It hurts, right?

896
01:08:30,810 --> 01:08:31,810
Let's go, you bastard.

897
01:08:31,810 --> 01:08:35,810
- You bastard...
- I'm sorry!

898
01:09:02,810 --> 01:09:04,810
<i>Where's that last one?</i>

899
01:09:05,310 --> 01:09:07,810
<i>He should be here somewhere...</i>

900
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:08,810
<i>Jung Hwan.</i>

901
01:09:09,310 --> 01:09:11,310
<i>Where did you go?</i>

902
01:09:12,310 --> 01:09:14,310
<i>This bastard...</i>

903
01:11:48,310 --> 01:11:49,310
Dad!

904
01:11:52,310 --> 01:11:55,310
Dad. Mom says to hurry up and come home.
Let's go.

905
01:11:55,310 --> 01:11:56,310
Okay?

906
01:11:58,310 --> 01:12:02,810
Okay. Just finish that, and come. Okay?
I'll be waiting until you come home!

907
01:12:03,810 --> 01:12:07,310
Take this and go home first.

908
01:12:14,310 --> 01:12:16,310
I'm sorry.

909
01:12:33,810 --> 01:12:35,510
<i>You didn't get it
exchanged today, either?</i>

910
01:12:41,310 --> 01:12:44,310
You better get this exchanged tomorrow.
Got it, honey?

911
01:12:45,810 --> 01:12:49,310
I bought it from a friend,
so how could I ask them to exchange it?

912
01:12:49,310 --> 01:12:50,810
I'll just wear it.

913
01:12:51,810 --> 01:12:57,310
Friend? Friend, my ass. How could you
call that bastard a friend?

914
01:13:05,810 --> 01:13:08,310
What kind of friend does that?

915
01:13:08,310 --> 01:13:11,310
Why are all your friends like that?

916
01:13:12,810 --> 01:13:13,810
Geez.

917
01:13:13,810 --> 01:13:17,310
After they heard we became better off,
they all came asking for money.

918
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:21,310
And when we didn't even have a single
briquette, they didn't even call.

919
01:13:24,810 --> 01:13:27,310
But, um... what does
he do nowadays?

920
01:13:27,310 --> 01:13:29,210
You know, when Jung Bong
was about this big

921
01:13:29,210 --> 01:13:31,310
and he caught a cold
but we had no money for medicine

922
01:13:31,310 --> 01:13:33,310
so we were borrowing money
left and right...

923
01:13:33,310 --> 01:13:35,810
you know, your friend
from your hometown.

924
01:13:35,810 --> 01:13:37,310
The one who came to Seoul with you.

925
01:13:38,310 --> 01:13:39,310
Geez.

926
01:13:39,310 --> 01:13:44,310
He came by suddenly,
and... did he have soju with you then?

927
01:13:44,310 --> 01:13:45,310
Geez.

928
01:13:45,310 --> 01:13:47,810
I thought that he really
had no common sense.

929
01:13:47,810 --> 01:13:50,810
A guest in a dilapidated home?

930
01:13:52,310 --> 01:13:53,810
That's what I thought, but...

931
01:13:54,310 --> 01:13:58,310
he gave me 50,000 won
secretly on the way out

932
01:13:58,310 --> 01:14:01,810
telling me to buy
something delicious for the kids.

933
01:14:02,810 --> 01:14:05,310
Even though he was in dire straits, too.

934
01:14:07,810 --> 01:14:11,810
Back then, with 50,000 won...
geez.

935
01:14:12,810 --> 01:14:15,310
Back then, that friend of yours
seemed like God himself.

936
01:14:15,310 --> 01:14:16,810
Our savior.

937
01:14:21,810 --> 01:14:23,810
Have more of those friends.

938
01:14:23,810 --> 01:14:27,310
Instead of having bad friends
who hurt you.

939
01:14:29,810 --> 01:14:30,810
Okay?

940
01:14:32,310 --> 01:14:33,810
Give him a call!

941
01:14:36,310 --> 01:14:38,310
That's him.

942
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:45,810
He's... the one.

943
01:15:43,310 --> 01:15:44,810
No thanks.

944
01:15:55,310 --> 01:15:59,310
Ma'am. Give it here.

945
01:16:06,310 --> 01:16:10,810
Today's the last time.

946
01:16:11,810 --> 01:16:15,310
I can't help you out anymore.

947
01:16:20,310 --> 01:16:23,810
Yes, yes. Go home.

948
01:17:18,310 --> 01:17:20,310
It was a shocking Sunday morning.

949
01:17:20,310 --> 01:17:25,810
<i>The four convicts who escaped
were caught at a home of a hostage.</i>

950
01:17:25,810 --> 01:17:29,310
<i>Unfortunately, this hostage situation
ended in bloodshed.</i>

951
01:17:29,810 --> 01:17:33,310
<i>The escapees had final words to say</i>

952
01:17:33,310 --> 01:17:35,310
<i>"The rich are innocent,
and the poor are guilty."</i>

953
01:17:35,310 --> 01:17:36,810
<i>If one has money,
one is blameless</i>

954
01:17:36,810 --> 01:17:38,810
<i>and if one has no money,
one bears blame.</i>

955
01:17:39,310 --> 01:17:42,310
<i>This incident shows the
shortcomings of our society...</i>

956
01:17:42,310 --> 01:17:47,310
Oh dear. Geez. How pitiful.

957
01:17:48,310 --> 01:17:50,810
What's so pitiful about them?

958
01:17:50,810 --> 01:17:55,310
Did they just figure that out?

959
01:17:56,310 --> 01:17:59,310
Mom! Dad! I'm back!

960
01:17:59,310 --> 01:18:01,310
Ta-da!
A present!

961
01:18:01,310 --> 01:18:03,810
You little... where did I put the switch?

962
01:18:03,810 --> 01:18:06,310
How dare you lose that?
You know how expensive it was?

963
01:18:09,810 --> 01:18:10,810
Hey!

964
01:18:17,310 --> 01:18:19,810
I'm sorry, Mom! Forgive me!

965
01:18:19,810 --> 01:18:22,310
Just where do you keep your brain?

966
01:18:22,310 --> 01:18:24,310
How could you be so absentminded?

967
01:18:24,310 --> 01:18:25,310
I'm sorry!

968
01:18:28,310 --> 01:18:30,310
Stop right there!

969
01:18:30,310 --> 01:18:33,310
Mom, I thought you said it was okay!
Why are you so mad?

970
01:18:33,310 --> 01:18:35,810
Then, what was I supposed to say
in front of your teacher?

971
01:18:35,810 --> 01:18:37,110
I'm going to beat you to death!

972
01:18:37,110 --> 01:18:39,810
Stop hiding behind him!
Jung Hwan, move!

973
01:18:40,310 --> 01:18:41,310
Move!

974
01:18:42,310 --> 01:18:45,310
Can't you just buy another one?

975
01:18:45,310 --> 01:18:48,310
Ma'am, please calm down.

976
01:18:48,310 --> 01:18:51,310
Jung Hwan, move.
I'm going to beat her to death today.

977
01:18:51,310 --> 01:18:53,310
- Move!
- Mom!

978
01:18:53,310 --> 01:18:54,810
I'm so sorry!
I won't do that again!

979
01:18:54,810 --> 01:18:55,810
Okay?

980
01:18:55,810 --> 01:19:01,310
"Again," my ass!
Get over here!

981
01:19:13,310 --> 01:19:14,310
Damn it!

982
01:19:14,310 --> 01:19:16,310
I can't live like this.

983
01:19:16,310 --> 01:19:18,310
Who did she take after
to be like that?

984
01:19:18,310 --> 01:19:20,310
Geez... you know how
expensive that was?

985
01:19:22,310 --> 01:19:26,310
My treasure... oh, my treasure.

986
01:19:26,310 --> 01:19:29,310
At this rate, you'll kill her over it.

987
01:19:29,310 --> 01:19:31,810
We can just buy a new camera.

988
01:19:31,810 --> 01:19:36,310
You beat her that much
just because she lost that?

989
01:19:36,310 --> 01:19:38,310
This is all your fault.

990
01:19:39,310 --> 01:19:41,310
If only you earned a lot of money...

991
01:19:41,310 --> 01:19:44,310
do you think I would have
beat her like that, then?

992
01:19:44,310 --> 01:19:46,810
Even if you hadn't
become riddled with debt

993
01:19:46,810 --> 01:19:48,810
we'd be living like the folks upstairs.

994
01:19:48,810 --> 01:19:52,310
If only I had money, I could've
been such a better mom for the kids.

995
01:19:52,310 --> 01:19:55,810
This is all because
we don't have any money!

996
01:19:55,810 --> 01:19:57,810
This is all your fault!

997
01:20:01,810 --> 01:20:03,310
Where are you going?

998
01:20:03,810 --> 01:20:05,310
To go earn some money.

999
01:20:05,810 --> 01:20:08,810
I thought you wanted to
live like the folks upstairs.

1000
01:20:08,810 --> 01:20:12,810
So I'm going to acquire me
some sudden wealth, too.

1001
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:18,310
Don't buy it! It's a waste of money!

1002
01:20:19,310 --> 01:20:22,310
You think just anyone has
that kind of luck?

1003
01:20:24,810 --> 01:20:25,810
Damn it...

1004
01:20:28,810 --> 01:20:29,810
Geez!

1005
01:20:37,810 --> 01:20:41,810
<i>[May 1985, Three Years Ago]</i>

1006
01:21:00,810 --> 01:21:02,810
Ooh, it's a new side dish!

1007
01:21:02,810 --> 01:21:05,810
Looks yummy. Wow, there's even
tofu in there!

1008
01:21:05,810 --> 01:21:07,810
Is today a special day?

1009
01:21:11,310 --> 01:21:13,310
Hurry up and eat while
I'm still saying it nicely.

1010
01:21:14,310 --> 01:21:15,310
Yes, Mother.

1011
01:21:16,810 --> 01:21:18,310
Jung Bong.

1012
01:21:18,310 --> 01:21:19,810
What are you collecting lately?

1013
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:26,310
I'm sure everyone remembers.

1014
01:21:26,310 --> 01:21:27,310
Yeah?

1015
01:21:27,310 --> 01:21:29,310
In 1981, on September 30...

1016
01:21:29,310 --> 01:21:33,810
Some great news reached us from a
small city in Germany called Baden Baden.

1017
01:21:36,810 --> 01:21:39,310
The one who won the bid
for the 1988 Olympics was...

1018
01:21:39,310 --> 01:21:40,310
Seoul!

1019
01:21:44,310 --> 01:21:46,510
He's interested in collecting
