Hello, ma'am!

3
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,890
Oh, you're here, Jung Hwan?

4
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:27,940
- I need the bathroom. Go to my room.
- Okay.

5
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:42,650
Wow... he put them all in
alphabetical order? What a freak.

I'm 100 percent sure now.

15

What are you talking about? Sit down.
I'll explain everything.

16
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,440
I'm good. I have no interest in hearing
about other people's love lives. Bye.

17

21
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,440
Is he home now?

22
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,440
He did come home, but he stayed up
all night so he's probably asleep now.

23
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,940
Then don't make any soup
for breakfast tomorrow.

24
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,440
I'm making some delicious
shirak soup tonight.

25

It's fine, though...

Hey, the blanket!

35
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:59,440
There's never any damn sunlight
down in this basement room...

36
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,940
Hey, my feet!
My feet are still not covered!

37
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,440
Hey!

38
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,120
Ugh, so cold!
Mom, there's no more hot water?

39
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,940
Oh, I guess No Eul used it to wash his
hair this morning. Just use cold water.

40
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,440
How can I do that?
I'll freeze to death!

What about Dad?

42
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:26,940
Huh?

I am.

49

- Aren't you going to be late?
- Yep, I am. I'm just going to go later.

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,940
Hey, Sung Duk Seon.

53
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,440
Did he confess his feelings to you yet?

54
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,940
You didn't, huh?

55
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:45,940
Hey.

56
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:49,940
Maybe he considers you to be
too precious, or something?

57
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:53,440
I think it's because he's worried
that you'll be way too shocked.

58
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,440
Geez.
You're so lucky.

59
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,440
Wow.
What a sincere guy.

60
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,440
Even so, he'll probably confess
before Christmas.

61
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,940
What if he misses his chance?

62
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,940
I think he'll confess soon.
I just have a hunch.

63
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:07,940
Hey.

64
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:12,440
If you kiss him, by any chance...
you have to tell us, okay? Got it?

65
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,440
Okay!

66
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,440
Of course I will.

67
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,940
Hey, can you get an autograph for me?

68
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,940
What?

69
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,440
Why do you need his autograph?

70
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,440
What's so great about being
student council president?

71
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,440
No, not from your boyfriend...
from Choi Taek!

72
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,440
Huh?

73
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,940
You said Choi Taek lives
in your neighborhood.

74
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,440
You know, the genius Baduk player.

75
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,440
My dad wants his autograph.

Duk Seon.

77
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,440
Can you introduce him to me?
I'll be really good to him.

78
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,440
No... just give me his phone number.
I'll take care of the rest.

79
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,440
Even I don't see him that often.
He's not home often.

80
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,440
And even when he is,
he just plays Baduk all day.

81
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,940
Even so, I bet you talk to him and stuff.

82
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,440
I'm so jealous!

83
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,440
He doesn't talk much.

84
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,940
It's so freaking frustrating.

85
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,940
Hey.

86
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,440
Apparently, they consider him
a God over in China.

87
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,940
I heard that they treat him as if
he is a god. The God of Baduk.

88
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,440
A god among gods.

89
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,940
A god?

90
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,140
More like the "King of Idiots."

91
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,440
Here.

92
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,940

You only act like this around us, right?

94
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,440
You won't act like this
anywhere else, right? Right?

95
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,440
Hey, people respect you like crazy.

96
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,440
There are some people who
believe that you're a god.

97
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,940
So, don't do anything
in front of other people.

98
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,440
Don't touch anything.

99
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,030
Ask other people to do something
for you if you don't know how. Okay?

100
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,440
Do you think that I'm an idiot?

101
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,940
It won't work.

102
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,440

What about my suit jacket?

graduate from Ssangmun Kindergarten?

177
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:09,940
Duk Seon.

178
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:14,440
Speaking of...
your cheeks are really red. Seriously!

179
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,940
See?

180
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:19,940
Hey, it's because I came from
the cold and into this warm room!

181
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,440
It won't last that long!

182
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,440
Geez, you...

183
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,440
Duk Seon.
Want me to make you a ramen?

184
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,440
It won't take that long.

185
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,940
No, it's okay.
I'm fine with this.

186
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,940
But why does Taek have to play
five rounds on his own?

187
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,440
It's because they're consecutive.

188
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,940
Hey... you think she understands
what you're saying?

189
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:40,440
All of the Korean players lost
and he's the only one left

190
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,440
but China has three,
while Japan has two.

191
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,940
But he'll have to win today
to keep going.

192
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:46,940
Oh.

193
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,940
But I think it'll be hard for
our Taek this time around.

194
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,440
How can he beat them all
on his own?

195
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,440
He doesn't seem to be
in a good state either.

196
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,440
Hey, Dong Ryong.

197
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,940
Worry about yourself.

198
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,440
Have you ever even seen him play?

199
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,690
And what about you,
Nello and Aurora?

200
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:11,940
He's on a different level than us,
is what I'm trying to say.

201
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,940
You idiots from the Forsythia class
at Ssangmun Kindergarten.

202
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:16,940
Okay?

203
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,440
Asshole.

204
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,440
Yes?

205
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,440
Yes.

206
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,440
Ow, my shoulder.

207
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,440
- Ah... you're so warm. How nice.
- Get away from me.

208
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,440
But I'm so cold.

209
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,940
My body and heart
are so cold lately.

210
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,440
<i>On this starry night...</i>

211
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,440
<i>Hello, everyone.</i>

212
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,440
<i>I'm Lee Moon Sae.</i>

213
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:12,440
<i>Wow... it's gotten very windy outside.</i>

214
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,440
<i>If, by any chance, you're with
someone you love right now</i>

215
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:22,940
<i>why not use the harsh winds as an excuse
to gently lean on them?</i>

216
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,440
<i>Into the embrace of your loved one,
which is warmer than anything else.</i>

217
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,940
<i>I'm sure they'll hold you tight.</i>

218
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,940
Oh yeah.
Jung Hwan.

219
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,440
There's not much time before
Jung Bong's college exams, right?

220
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,940
Are his studies going well?

221
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,940
Do you know what
my Big Bro's favorite number is?

222
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,440
What?

223
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,940
Lucky seven.

224
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,440
I think he's going to make a mistake.

225
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,940
He's busy writing postcards lately.

226
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,440
What postcards?

227
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,440
To who?

228
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,440
<i>This is today's first story.</i>

229
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,440
<i>Hello, Mr. Moon Sae.
I'm Kim Jung Bong from Ssangmundong.</i>

230
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,940
<i>It's been three years since I first
started listening to your program.</i>

231
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,940
<i>I'm a student who is about to retake
the college entrance exams again.</i>

232
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:12,940
Yes!

233
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:15,940
<i>Your voice and the great songs you play
are a great source of comfort</i>

234
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:19,440
<i>and strength to me, someone
who is worn out from studying.</i>

235
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:23,940
<i>If I make it into college this time,
it'll all be thanks to "Starry Night."</i>

236
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,440
<i>Mr. Moon Sae...</i>

237
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,440
Why does he call him mister
even though Jung Bong looks older?

238
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:32,440
I send postcards to them all the time...
I wonder why they never read mine?

239
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,940
Hey, shush.
Let's listen.

240
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,940
<i>I'm sure it's hard for you
to believe, but</i>

241
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,940
<i>do you know who lives on my block? </i>

242
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,940
<i>It's the genius Baduk player,
Choi Taek!</i>

243
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:48,440
<i>Choi Taek, 6-dan, and I,
are quite close.</i>

244
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:53,440
<i>But you know, Mr. Moon Sae,
Taek is having a difficult time</i>

245
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,940
<i>because he's competing
in a huge competition.</i>

246
00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:00,440
<i>Soon, he'll have his first match
in Shanghai, China</i>

247
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,440
<i>and his opponents all have an IQ of 160!</i>

248
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,440
<i>My IQ is lower than 90.</i>

249
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,440
<i>Jung Bong...</i>

250
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,940
<i>it seems that you've revealed your IQ
to the entire country.</i>

251
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,440
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

252
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:23,440
<i>Mr. Moon Sae, please cheer on our Taek
so he can beat his brainy opponents.</i>

253
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,440
<i>Since China is such a big country,
I'm sure he'll need a lot of support.</i>

254
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:33,440
<i>Honestly, I'm a Buddhist,
but I'll be praying for his success.</i>

255
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,940
<i>Ah...</i>

256
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,940
<i>But, what do we do,
Mr. Kim Jung Bong?</i>

257
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:41,440
<i>We get at least 50 postcards
from people who say</i>

258
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,940
<i>that they live on the same block
as Choi Taek.</i>

259
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:49,440
<i>So... next time, include a photo
you took with Choi Taek.</i>

260
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,440
<i>We need some means of confirmation.</i>

261
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,440
<i>Even so, we'll have to give you a gift.</i>

262
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,440
<i>To you, Mr. Kim Jung Bong
of Ssangmundong...</i>

263
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,940
<i>We'll give you the third place prize...
it's all the rage lately.</i>

264
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,940
<i>A Cabbage Patch Kids doll!</i>

265
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:08,440
<i>We'd love to have Choi Taek
on our show sometime.</i>

266
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,440
<i>That'd be nice... right?</i>

267
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,940
<i>Oh, we also have some news
that just came in.</i>

268
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:20,440
<i>Choi Taek, 6-dan, defeated
that IQ-of-160 Chinese player!</i>

269
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,440
- Wow!
- Wow!

270
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,440
<i>Wow, how amazing.</i>

271
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:31,440
<i>For Choi Taek,  6-dan, who was
victorious in a lonely battle.....</i>

272
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,440
<i>With well wishes sent his way, saying
that today will be a special day...</i>

273
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,440
<i>- We'll play One Day's...</i>
- On That Kind of Day!

274
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,940
<i>"On That Kind of Day."</i>

275
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,940
Give me some room.

276
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,940
Hey, give me some of the blanket!

277
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:51,940
Fine.

278
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,940
Hey, hey, hey!

279
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:55,940
Geez!

280
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,940
Keep still.

281
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,940
Hey, hey, hey!
Stay still!

282
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,440
I'm off.

283
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,440
Okay, bye.

284
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,440
See you tomorrow.

285
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,440
How many more people does
Taek have to play now?

286
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:55,940
Four.

287
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:59,440
The Chinese have two people left,
but all of them are really skilled.

288
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,440
Wow!

289
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,940
Do you think Taek can win?

290
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:05,440
- I don't know. He has to keep it up.
- It'd be nice if he won though, right?

291
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,440
Yeah. If he wins,
we'll get pizza.

292
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,440
Yeah!

293
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:21,440
<i>The second round of the 6th International
Baduk Championships will start soon.</i>

294
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,440
<i>Choi Taek, 6-dan's opponent today
is Japan's Jang Shuei, 9-dan.</i>

295
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,940
He is a skilled Japanese player
who has won over 1,400 matches.<i></i>

296
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:32,440
<i>Japan stated that Korea
would lose today for sure--</i>

297
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,940
Hi!

298
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,940
How many more does
he have to beat, now?

299
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:38,940
Four.

300
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,440
Wow... still four more left to go?

301
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,940
That'll be difficult.

302
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,940
At any rate, if...

303
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:51,940
Taek defeats both China and Japan...
you can't settle for chicken this time.

304
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:55,440
You know, that thing... Maotai
or Mueitai, or whatever...

305
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,940
that really expensive Chinese liquor.
You have to buy that for us, all right?

306
00:21:58,940 --> 00:21:59,940
Okay.

307
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,440
But...

308
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,440
I think it'll be difficult
for him this time.

309
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,940
He has matches every day...

310
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:07,440
so it'll be hard on his health.

311
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,440
And on top of that,
he's in a slump lately.

312
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,440
I don't think it'll be possible
for him to be victorious.

313
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:19,940
Also, the remaining Chinese and
Japanese players are really good, so...

314
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:20,940
Yes.

315
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:27,940
That's why I said, "If!"

316
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,940
If he wins...

317
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,440
Maota or whatnot.
You know that thing, right?

318
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:38,440
Are you, by any chance... saying this
because you don't want to buy the liquor?

319
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,940
No, not at all!

320
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,940
It's just that...

321
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:48,440
he doesn't even get one day off
in between matches

322
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:52,440
and my Taek wasn't in such a good state
before this championship

323
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,940
so his mental state isn't great.

324
00:22:53,940 --> 00:23:00,440
So... whether or not he wins all depends
on how he overcomes these burdens.

325
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,440
<i>[Second Match]</i>

326
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:16,440
<i>[Korea's Choi Taek, 6-dan,
vs. Japan's Jang Shuei, 9-dan]</i>

327
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,440
Ah...

328
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,580
So you can make this kind of play
in this situation.

329
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,440
This is how you play.

330
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,440
Taek is amazing.

331
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,440
Should I make him my son-in-law?

332
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,940
My daughter...
daughter, daughter!

333
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:45,440
Oh, is that right?
Shall I try and seduce him for you, then?

334
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,440
Yeah!
Go ahead and do that!

335
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,440
I'm sure he has no eye for women
since all he knows is Baduk anyway.

336
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,440
What? What's wrong with me?

337
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,440
I'm a catch!

338
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:22,790
What is this?
Where did you get this car?

339
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,130
It's my upperclassman's.

340
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,390
They're going away for a while
so I'm using it for a few months.

341
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:28,790
Oh dear...

342
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:32,300
That's dangerous!
You've never driven before!

343
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,290
It's fine!
I just need to take it easy.

344
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:36,790
What's with that jacket?

345
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:40,790
I bought it by saving up my allowance.
So don't you pay any mind to it.

346
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:43,290
I'm wearing that jacket tomorrow.

347
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:44,790
Then I'm going to wear your dress.

348
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:46,290
The white, knee-length one.

349
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:47,790
Sure.

350
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:53,290
Wow, it's cold.
Let's go home. I'll make sujebi.

351
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,790
Get in!
We can take my car.

352
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,290
- No...
- We're almost home anyway!

353
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:58,290
It's cold!
Hurry up and get in!

354
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:01,790
- No! it's fine!
- It's right there!

355
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,290
Damn it!

356
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:07,290
- No! It's okay!
- Get in! It's cold!

357
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:09,290
Hurry up and get in!

358
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:10,290
Oh, but...

359
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:11,290
Hurry up and get in, Mom!

360
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:13,790
<i>We have some great news
from Shanghai, China.</i>

361
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:17,290
<i>Choi Taek, 6-dan, defeated
Jang Shuei, 9-dan of Japan</i>

362
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:20,290
<i>in 245 moves.</i>

363
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:23,290
<i>Choi Taek, 6-dan,
now has three matches left.</i>

364
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:26,790
<i>So, Korea is regaining the hope it had
lost in potentially winning it all.</i>

365
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:27,790
Honey!

366
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,790
I made some castella.
Come out and have some.

367
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:32,290
It's fine.
I don't want any.

368
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:34,290
Okay. Study, then.

369
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,790
What, he said he doesn't want any?

370
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:39,790
Yeah.

371
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,790
Jung Bong!

372
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,790
Bonggie!

373
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,790
He's busy studying!

374
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:46,290
<i>Don't bother him!</i>

375
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:48,290
Jung Bong! Have some castella.

376
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:50,790
No thank you, Mother.
I don't want any.

377
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,290
I don't have much time.

378
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:07,290
What did I tell you?

379
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:09,290
I told you not to bother him.

380
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:11,790
He just might really
have a shot this time.

381
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,790
His level of concentration is
totally different now.

382
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:16,790
See? When push comes to shove,
he gets things done.

383
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:27,790
Here... here.
I'll give it to you.

384
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,270
Stop it.
I'm serious.

385
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:33,290
Okay.
I won't.

386
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:45,790
How could you be so dumb,
as to fall for that again?

387
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:47,790
Okay.
For real, this time.

388
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:49,290
I won't do that again.

389
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:51,790
Really.
Okay?

390
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:16,790
<i>The first song on "Starry Night" tonight
is a song that many people requested.</i>

391
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:20,290
<i>Kim Hee Ae's "Don't Forget Me."</i>

392
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:23,290
<i>Um... I was thinking of reading</i>

393
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:27,790
<i>another one of Ssangmundong's
Kim Jung Bong's postcards.</i>

394
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:30,290
<i>I guess he's unemployed.
He sends postcards so often.</i>

395
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:32,790
<i>No... he said he was studying
for college entrance exams.</i>

396
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:36,790
<i>Maybe he gave up on them,
or maybe he's totally prepared for them.</i>

397
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,290
<i>It's one of those two.</i>

398
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:42,790
<i>"Mr. Moon Sae, I want to introduce you
to another star living in Ssangmundong."</i>

399
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,790
<i>Wow... I'm going to go insane.</i>

400
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:49,290
<i>Strangely enough, a lot of stars
seem to live in that neighborhood.</i>

401
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:54,290
<i>"The star I want to introduce today
is someone who lives downstairs from me."</i>

402
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:56,290
<i>"Her name is Sung Bo Ra."</i>

403
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:02,290
<i>"Bo Ra is the smartest person
in our neighborhood."</i>

404
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:05,290
<i>"She always had
the highest grades in school"</i>

405
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:07,290
<i>"and made 80th percentile
in the entire nation."</i>

406
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:09,290
"She was able to attend
Seoul University for Math Education"

407
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:10,290
<i>"due to her stellar grades."</i>

408
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:12,290
<i>"She's a genius among geniuses."</i>

409
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:19,290
<i>"Adults look at Ms. Sung and say that
she's off-putting and scary"</i>

410
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:22,290
<i>"and even say that she makes them
want to piss their pants."</i>

411
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:25,790
<i>"But the Sung Bo Ra that I know
just has a rough exterior."</i>

412
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:28,790
<i>"Otherwise, she has a heart of gold."</i>

413
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:36,790
Big Sis, are you out of your mind?

414
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:38,790
If Dad catches you,
you're dead!

415
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:40,290
Whatever.
What do you want?

416
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:44,290
Our great-aunt passed away.
We have to go see the family now.

417
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:45,790
Oh, really?

418
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:49,290
Okay.

419
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:02,790
Um... Bo Ra.

420
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:05,290
We can just take the bus, you know.

421
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:07,300
None of the buses are running anymore.

422
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:10,290
Which one was it, again?

423
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,290
Bo Ra!

424
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:13,790
Bo Ra, we'll take a taxi.
This is hard on you, right?

425
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:14,790
It's not like we're rich.

426
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:16,290
We have no money for that.

427
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:17,290
Let's just go.

428
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,790
This goes here,
and then...

429
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:26,790
Damn this shitty car...

430
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:29,440
Hey, you have to
turn off the side lights.

431
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,790
Oh yeah.

432
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:32,260
- Big Sis! Look forward!
- Bo Ra! Forward!

433
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,290
I am looking forward!

434
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:36,290
It's a puppy!

435
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:37,790
I told you, I am looking!

436
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:50,790
Hey... I think...
the car hit something.

437
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:51,790
Should I go take a look?

438
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:52,790
No! Don't leave the car!

439
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:54,290
It'll only take a second!

440
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:55,290
Don't leave the car!

441
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:56,290
Don't move!

442
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:58,790
I think we hit a puppy or something.
We have to go out and take a look!

443
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:00,290
We can't just sit here!

444
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:01,290
I told you, don't leave!

445
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:03,790
Then hurry up and go!
What if another car comes up behind us?

446
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:05,290
No!
I'm not moving!

447
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:06,790
What if it just makes it worse?

448
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:10,790
Honey, get out of the car
and see what it is!

449
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:11,790
Don't leave the car!

450
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:14,290
Don't leave!
Nobody move!

451
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:16,290
Hurry and go!
A car is coming!

452
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:17,790
I told you, I'm not budging!

453
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:19,790
I'm not moving!

454
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:21,790
Jesus.

455
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:30,290
Hey.
Turn it off!

456
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:34,790
Hey, you have to get out
and check out the situation!

457
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:37,160
No! You can't go out, no matter what!
If you do, watch what happens!

458
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:40,160
Bo Ra... I think it'd be fine for us
to keep going slowly then.

459
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,790
Are you crazy? What if it's a dead dog?
We can't just leave it here!

460
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:46,290
We're going to spend all night here,
at this rate!

461
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:49,790
You're so damn immature!

462
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:52,290
What the hell did I do?

463
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:57,790
<i>One day...
he'll come back to my side...</i>

464
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:58,790
Turn that shit off!

465
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:01,290
You're not dead, bastard!
Keep it together!

466
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:02,790
We're going to spend the night here...

467
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:06,790
<i>This heart quivers
at the thought of you...</i>

468
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:31,290
Did something happen?
You're dancing so happily.

469
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:33,290
Yeah.
Taek won again.

470
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:34,290
Really?

471
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:37,290
Taek said he'll buy us pizza
if he wins again.

472
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:40,290
But there's still three more people left.

473
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:42,190
Ugh... I need to catch my breath.

474
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:46,070
The King of Baduk in Korea.

475
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,270
- Man, what are you doing?
- The King of Baduk in Korea.

476
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,790
Hey, stop it!

477
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:56,290
<i>[The Third Match]</i>

478
00:31:56,290 --> 00:32:01,790
<i>[Korea's Choi Taek, 6-dan,
vs. China's Wang Le Yi, 9-dan]</i>

479
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:12,790
The match will now begin.

480
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:00,290
Mom, did you see my jacket?

481
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:03,290
Your sister has it. She said she has
an athletic competition today.

482
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:06,290
Really?
Then I'm going to wear her dress.

483
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:08,790
Go ahead.
You two made a promise, didn't you?

484
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:10,290
But can you wear that,
in this weather?

485
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:12,290
It's okay!
I just need to wear a coat over it.

486
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:36,290
Damn it...

487
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:43,290
Sung Bo Ra, that crazy bitch!

488
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:46,790
I'm going to kill her!

489
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:50,790
I got it!

490
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:08,790
All right!

491
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:10,790
I got it!

492
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:15,290
Move, move!
It's mine! Go away!

493
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:17,790
I got it!

494
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:22,650
I bought this bag today.

495
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:24,490
Wow. Looks awesome.

496
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:27,160
Try and make some sense.

497
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:31,290
Students.

498
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:35,790
Let's chat for a second.

499
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:37,790
This was expensive, man.

500
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:40,290
Hey!

501
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:42,790
Who are you?

502
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:47,790
You two made two mistakes.

503
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:51,790
The first was that
you two students were smoking.

504
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:54,790
The second one was that you two threw
your cigarette butts on the ground.

505
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:56,790
Okay?

506
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:59,790
Hey, Mister.
Just go.

507
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:05,790
You made a third mistake just now.

508
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:10,790
I'm not a "Mister."

509
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:17,290
I told you to leave, Mister!

510
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:20,290
I told you, I'm not a "Mister."

511
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:21,790
Goddamn it...

512
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:23,290
Hey!

513
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:24,290
You little...

514
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:25,290
Ow!

515
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:32,790
What the hell did you say,
you little shit?

516
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:36,290
Who are you?

517
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:38,290
Who do you think?
The Harbinger of Justice.

518
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:41,290
Hey, you're from
Ssangmun High, right?

519
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:43,790
Want me to get the dean? Huh?

520
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:45,290
He lives right around here!

521
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:48,290
- No, ma'am.
- No, ma'am.

522
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:53,290
You damn troublemakers.

523
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:56,490
A student smokes '88s?
And not even Evergreens?

524
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:57,790
I'm sorry, ma'am.

525
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,790
Oh ho.

526
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:03,290
U.S.A. handmade goods? Huh?

527
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:05,790
You know how great
Korean-made goods are, nowadays?

528
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:07,790
Now, repeat after me.

529
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,790
Let's use Korean-made products!

530
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:11,790
- Let's use...
- Let's use...

531
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:13,790
Louder!

532
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:15,790
Let's use Korean-made products!

533
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:17,790
- Let's use Korean-made products!
- Let's use Korean-made products!

534
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:19,290
Let's quit smoking!

535
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:22,290
- Let's quit smoking!
- Let's quit smoking!

536
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:24,750
We are the nation's hope!

537
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,790
We are the...

538
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:27,790
nation's...

539
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:29,790
We are the nation's hope!

540
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:31,790
- We are the nation's hope!
- We are the nation's hope!

541
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:34,790
We will free the country!

542
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:36,790
- We will free the country!
- We will free the country!

543
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:42,290
Free the unjustly imprisoned protesters!

544
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:45,790
Stop raising the tuition!

545
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:47,790
- Stop raising...
- Stop raising...

546
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:49,790
- The tuition!
- Tuition!

547
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:52,290
- Stop raising the tuition!
- Stop raising the tuition!

548

<i>A miracle is happening at the
championships in Shanghai, China.</i>

549
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:11,290
<i>The only player left representing
Korea, Choi Taek, 6-dan</i>

550
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:15,790
<i>defeated China's Wang Lei, 9-dan, and
Japan's Wang Li Man, 9-dan consecutively.</i>

551
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:21,290
<i>And today will be his last match,
against China's Wang Shi, 6-dan.</i>

552
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:25,290
I'm off.

553
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:26,290
Okay.

554
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:31,790
Why not just live here
if you're going to come by every day?

555
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:33,790
I'm not here to see you.

556
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:36,290
Is Jung Bong up?

557
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:37,290
Yeah.

558
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:38,790
Why?

559
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:41,790
I always send postcards to
"Starry Night"

560
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:43,290
but they only ever pick his.

561
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:46,290
I want to borrow some
postcards from Jung Bong.

562
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:54,290
Your Big Bro isn't studying lately?

563
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:56,790
Did he ever?

564
00:37:58,290 --> 00:37:59,790
I'm off.

565
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:06,790
Oh my, oh my!
What are you up to?

566
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:09,790
There's only one guy left now, huh?

567
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:12,290
Yes. If he wins today,
he'll be the champion.

568
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,790
Wow.

569
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:17,290
Taek is really something.

570
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:20,790
He just destroyed five guys on his own!

571
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:22,790
Then, when Taek comes back

572
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:26,540
shall we throw him a congratulatory party
and have some drinks?

573
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,900
There's still one game left.

574
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,790
He has to win today to be the champion.

575
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:32,290
Geez... stop spouting all this nonsense.

576
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:35,790
Isn't that last Chinese guy a newbie?

577
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:39,450
Of course Taek will win!

578
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:41,290
It's not so simple
when it comes to Baduk.

579
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:44,790
What do you mean?
Our Taek is no ordinary kid.

580
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:48,290
All the great Baduk players in the world
were beaten by Taek!

581
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:53,290
So there's no way that some greenhorn
would have a chance against him!

582
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:55,790
Taek has a curse.

583
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:57,790
Huh? What do you mean?

584
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:01,790
As you know, he's a quiet kid.

585
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:03,790
He doesn't take well to strangers.

586
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:06,790
Yeah, that's true.

587
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:09,290
He's wary of strangers
when it comes to Baduk, too.

588
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:10,290
What?

589
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:12,290
He's somewhat weak mentally.

590
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:15,790
When he faces someone
for the first time, he crumbles.

591
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:17,290
Oh.

592
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:18,790
Mister!

593
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:20,290
Did Sun Woo pass by?

594
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:21,290
Yeah, just now.

595
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:22,290
Damn it!

596
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:23,790
Greet people properly!

597
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:25,290
Goodbye!

598
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:32,790
So if he's really unlucky,
he could lose. Geez.

599
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:35,790
Well, even if he loses,
we've been cheering him on so much

600
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:39,290
we wore ourselves out, so...
let's have a drink.

601
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:40,290
Good luck!

Sir.

606
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:23,290
Why isn't Choi Taek here yet?

607
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:26,790
Did something happen?

608
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:31,290
Choi Taek comes right on time.

609
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:35,790
He gets lost in thought, and comes
right as the match is supposed to begin.

610
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:41,290
He's here.

611
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:52,790
Wow.

612
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:55,790
He looks like he's about to pass out.

613
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:57,790
I guess he didn't get any sleep.

614
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:59,290
Reporter Shi.

615
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,790
He's had five consecutive matches!

616
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:04,290
Even during nationals,
they give people at least one day off.

617
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:09,290
The fact that he's even able to
sit there is an incredible feat.

618
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:14,330
Even if he loses today, make sure
you write a nice article about him.

619
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:16,790
No way he'll lose!

620
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:21,790
It's because everyone speaks like that,
that Taek can't sleep.

621
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:22,790
Geez.

622
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:41,290
I guess Choi Taek will be
playing with the black stones.

623
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:47,790
But... isn't his record better when
he plays with white stones?

624
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:54,790
We will now begin the match.

625
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:57,790
We would like all the members
of the press to leave in ten minutes.

626
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,620
Geez.

627
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:43,290
Mister, have you heard anything?

628
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:44,290
Did you get a call?

629
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:45,790
No, not yet.

630
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:47,790
Ah, okay.

631
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:57,290
Hey! What happened with Taek?

632
00:42:57,290 --> 00:42:58,290
Did he win?

633
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:00,790
What, did he lose?

634
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:05,290
The match isn't over yet.
I'm waiting for his call.

635
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:06,290
Damn it.

636
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:15,790
Mister, how about Taek?
Did he win?

637
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:17,790
No, not yet.

638
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:27,790
You haven't heard from Taek yet?

639
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:29,290
We don't know yet.

640
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:30,790
Oh...

641
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:41,790
The match isn't over yet,
and I haven't gotten a call.

642
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:43,790
Go home and wait.

643
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:54,290
He still hasn't called?

644
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:55,790
No, not yet.

645
00:43:55,790 --> 00:43:57,290

<i>Not only that, I've fallen in love
with a childhood friend.</i>

654
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:38,290
<i>Whenever I see him,

<i>Even his name is so cool, right?</i>

660
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:54,290
<i>But his looks are even more
charismatic than his name.</i>

661

Hey!

670
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:18,290
What happened?
Did he win?

671
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:20,180
Did he win, or lose?

672
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:22,790
I'm sure the results must have
been announced by now!

673
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:24,290
Tell us!

674
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:25,790
Jung Hwan didn't tell you?

675
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:28,790
No. He just went straight to his room.

676
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:34,290
Stop beating around the bush and tell us!
I'm going to get mad!

677
00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:38,790
He won.

678
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:42,790
I told you, didn't I?
That Taek would win!

679
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:44,790
Hip, hip, hooray!

680
00:47:44,790 --> 00:47:47,790
On a day like this,
we can't not have these!

681
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:27,790
What are you going to do now?

682
00:48:30,290 --> 00:48:32,290
There aren't any competitions coming up.

683

00:48:58,790 --> 00:49:03,290
<i>has beaten the odds and won five
straight matches to win the championship.</i>

689
00:49:05,790 --> 00:49:09,790
Oh my! I knew Taek was good,
but I didn't know he was this good.

690
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:10,790
It's just us.

691
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:14,290
Apparently, they treat him better than
the President himself everywhere else.

692
00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:15,790
Really?

693
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:20,570
Duk Seon, what are you doing?
Come eat some sweet potatoes.

694
00:49:20,570 --> 00:49:22,790
I'm sure she shoved something else
down her pie hole already.

695
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:27,790
How can you say that about your sister?
Why not just say "ate?"

696
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:29,790
Duk Seon.

697
00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:32,290
Have some sweet potatoes
before they get cold.

698
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:35,790
I'm not having any!
I can't get full on something like that.

699
00:49:37,290 --> 00:49:39,790
Geez... he should've called by now.

700
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:46,790
<i>Choi Taek, 6-dan, was suffering through
a slump prior to the championship.</i>

701
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:51,790
<i>However, he proved his world-class
skill set to the nation once again</i>

702
00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:57,790
<i>by winning five consecutive games to
become the reigning champion.</i>

703
00:49:57,790 --> 00:50:01,290
<i>Choi Taek, 6-dan, remained
unaffected by the doubt surrounding him</i>

704
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:04,290
<i>and confidently won the championship
with his arsenal of sklls.</i>

705
00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:10,290
<i>His performance makes one go
crazy at the fact that he is merely 18.</i>

706
00:50:11,030 --> 00:50:13,350
Jung Hwan.
Have some sweet potatoes.

707
00:50:14,790 --> 00:50:16,790
It's fine.

708
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:18,290
Taek still isn't home yet?

709
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:28,830
Have some rice cakes!
Aren't you hungry?

710
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:30,790
You have some.
I'm fine.

711
00:50:30,790 --> 00:50:34,290
Geez... your head is going to roll off
your shoulders while you wait.

712
00:50:37,290 --> 00:50:39,290
Hello?
You're here?

713
00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:40,790
Okay.

714
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:42,790
Mom, I'm off!

715
00:50:45,790 --> 00:50:46,790
Hello?

716
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:48,290
Okay!

717
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:52,790
I'm sure Taek is tired!
Come home soon, okay?

718
00:50:56,290 --> 00:50:58,790
Yeah! Taek, you're home?

719
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:01,290
Okay!
I'm coming! Okay!

720
00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:03,790
Oh geez...

721
00:51:03,790 --> 00:51:05,290
Watch your step!

722
00:51:05,290 --> 00:51:07,210
You're going to trip like that.

723
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,430
You're here?

724
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:40,790
I came as quickly as I could,
but I stopped by the club...

725
00:51:47,790 --> 00:51:49,290
Hurry over.

726
00:51:56,790 --> 00:51:57,790
Then...

727
00:51:57,790 --> 00:51:58,790
I'm eating this one.

728
00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:00,280
Why?
Are you out of your mind?

729
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,790
You want to die?

730
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,790
What the hell?
You were all like, "I have no appetite."

731
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:06,790
I'm taking it home.

732
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:08,290
Hey, play rock-paper-scissors for it!

733
00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:10,790
Damn it.

734
00:52:11,290 --> 00:52:14,290
I confessed to the girl that works
at the study room, and got rejected.

735
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:16,290
I'm so pitiful.

736
00:52:17,290 --> 00:52:19,290
I live in a half-basement.

737
00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:26,290
Jung Hwan lived in a one-bedroom house
until three years ago.

738
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:32,290
My older sister is Sung Bo Ra.

739
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:37,290
His older brother is Kim Jung Bong.

740
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:38,610
Damn it...

741
00:52:38,610 --> 00:52:40,790
What?
I like my older brother.

742
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:41,790
Then I'm eating this one.

743
00:52:41,790 --> 00:52:42,790
No, no, no, wait.

744
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:44,290
Want to chime in?

745
00:52:44,290 --> 00:52:45,790
What, something pitiful about myself?

746
00:52:50,290 --> 00:52:52,290
You better not bring up your dad.

747
00:52:53,290 --> 00:52:55,790
You better not bring up your mom.
That's cheating.

748
00:52:56,290 --> 00:52:57,790
You punks...

749
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:07,860
I have someone I like...

750
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:09,800
But I haven't been able to confess
my feelings for two years now.

751
00:53:21,790 --> 00:53:24,790
I was just kidding...
What's up with this mood shift?

752
00:53:24,790 --> 00:53:26,290
Fine. You eat it.

753
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:27,790
Yeah, go ahead.

754
00:53:27,790 --> 00:53:29,290
It's true, though.

755
00:53:33,790 --> 00:53:35,790
What's up with this gloomy mood?

756
00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:39,290
I don't know what to do.

757
00:53:41,790 --> 00:53:43,290
Confess.

758
00:53:43,790 --> 00:53:44,790
What?

759
00:53:45,290 --> 00:53:46,790
I said, confess!

760
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:50,290
Do it on the first day that it snows.

761
00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:56,790
Damn it...

762
00:53:57,790 --> 00:54:00,790
Confess on the day of
the first snowfall! Okay?

763
00:54:08,290 --> 00:54:10,790
Wow... Taek is really something.

764
00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:15,400
You must be so happy!

765
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:18,290
Yes, I feel good today.

766
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:21,790
Um... that's why I'm saying this...

767
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:27,290
But do you want to trade,
my three kids for Taek?

768
00:54:27,290 --> 00:54:28,790
Three-for-one trade.

769
00:54:28,790 --> 00:54:32,790
If you think about it,
you're not really losing out.

770
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:38,290
It's because it's so damn hard
to raise daughters!

771
00:54:38,290 --> 00:54:39,790
That's right!

772
00:54:39,790 --> 00:54:42,290
Raising a daughter
like Bo Ra is difficult!

773
00:54:42,290 --> 00:54:45,790
I can't even look her in the face,
she's so scary.

774
00:54:45,790 --> 00:54:48,290
Geez.

775
00:54:48,790 --> 00:54:50,790
Where's Jin Joo?
I don't see her around.

776
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:52,790
I sent her to her grandmother's house.

777
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:55,790
Tae Seok said he was going,
so I had her tag along.

778
00:54:55,790 --> 00:54:57,790
Even so, I guess she's not
putting up a fuss and is doing well.

779
00:54:57,790 --> 00:55:00,290
Yeah! She loves my mom!

780
00:55:00,290 --> 00:55:04,790
She gets to eat all the things she likes
and, in turn, so do I...

781
00:55:06,290 --> 00:55:07,790
What the...

782
00:55:07,790 --> 00:55:09,290
We're already out of liquor!

783
00:55:11,290 --> 00:55:12,290
Geez.

784
00:55:12,290 --> 00:55:19,790
Yeah... why'd you only buy one?
You should've bought at least three.

785
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:21,790
- I'll go buy some.
- No, no, no.

786
00:55:21,790 --> 00:55:24,290
We have some plum wine at home.

787
00:55:24,290 --> 00:55:27,790
Honey, call home and
ask Bo Ra to bring in.

788
00:55:27,790 --> 00:55:29,790
We have other kids, though.

789
00:55:29,790 --> 00:55:33,790
No Eul went to go sleep over
at his friend's house

790
00:55:33,790 --> 00:55:37,290
and Duk Seon is hanging out at Taek's.

791
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:39,790
What are you doing?
Hurry up and call.

792
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:48,790
<i>Why are you asking me to bring that?</i>

793
00:55:48,790 --> 00:55:49,790
<i>No!</i>

794
00:55:49,790 --> 00:55:51,290
<i>I'm getting ready to go to
my upperclassman's place!</i>

795
00:55:51,290 --> 00:55:52,790
<i>I told you that I'm sleeping there!</i>

796
00:55:55,290 --> 00:55:57,790
So... like... on your way out...

797
00:55:57,790 --> 00:56:00,790
you can drop by here for a quick second.

798
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:05,790
You'd be here after you take
four steps out the door.

799
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:15,290
Geez, that girl.

800
00:56:15,290 --> 00:56:17,290
She was so loud,
I thought she'd pop out of the phone.

801
00:56:17,790 --> 00:56:19,790
Just watch.
She'll come anyway.

802
00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:21,290
Really, Miss?

803
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:23,290
Want to bet on it?
Whether she'll come or not?

804
00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:24,790
She'll come!
Just watch!

805
00:56:24,790 --> 00:56:27,790
Even though she talks like that,
she has a warm heart.

806
00:56:28,790 --> 00:56:33,290
If her heart was any warmer,
we'd all burn to death.

807
00:56:39,790 --> 00:56:41,790
See?
I told you she'd come.

808
00:56:41,790 --> 00:56:44,790
Bo Ra, come over here!

809
00:56:47,290 --> 00:56:48,790
Where's the bathroom?

810
00:56:48,790 --> 00:56:50,790
Bathroom?

811
00:56:50,790 --> 00:56:52,290
This way.

812
00:56:58,290 --> 00:57:00,790
Oh... who could that be,
at this hour?

813
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:07,290
Since when?

814
00:57:08,290 --> 00:57:10,790
What did the people at the hospital say?

815
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:12,790
Yeah.

816
00:57:13,790 --> 00:57:14,790
Oh.

817
00:57:15,290 --> 00:57:17,790
Even so, you have to stay by her side
and watch her all night.

818
00:57:17,790 --> 00:57:19,790
Her fever could go up
out of nowhere.

819
00:57:22,290 --> 00:57:27,790
Um... I'll take the first bus down there
tomorrow morning, Mom.

820
00:57:29,290 --> 00:57:30,290
Yeah.

821
00:57:30,290 --> 00:57:31,290
Okay.

822
00:57:35,790 --> 00:57:37,700
Is Jin Joo sick?

823
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:38,790
Yeah.

824
00:57:38,790 --> 00:57:41,290
She said that her fever went up to
40 degrees, Celsius.

825
00:57:41,790 --> 00:57:43,290
What about the hospital?

826
00:57:43,290 --> 00:57:45,740
They went and she got
better after that, but...

827
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:47,290
Geez.

828
00:57:47,290 --> 00:57:50,790
I didn't even know she was sick...
and here I was, getting drunk.

829
00:57:52,290 --> 00:57:54,790
Don't you have to go down there?

830
00:57:55,290 --> 00:57:57,290
Let's go.
I'll give you a ride down there.

831
00:57:57,290 --> 00:57:58,790
Sit down!

832
00:57:58,790 --> 00:58:00,790
You can't drink and drive!

833
00:58:01,290 --> 00:58:02,290
Oh geez...

834
00:58:02,290 --> 00:58:04,290
I bet that the trains
stopped running by now, too.

835
00:58:04,290 --> 00:58:06,790
Just take the first train
down there tomorrow.

836
00:58:06,790 --> 00:58:07,790
She'll be fine.

837
00:58:07,790 --> 00:58:10,790
They said they went to the hospital,
so I'm sure she'll be fine.

838
00:58:11,290 --> 00:58:14,290
Don't worry! Kids all get sick
while they're growing up.

839
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:16,290
Goodbye.

840
00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:19,790
Hey!

841
00:58:19,790 --> 00:58:23,790
About this upperclassman...
it's a girl, right?

842
00:58:23,790 --> 00:58:25,790
Geez, she's an adult now!

843
00:58:25,790 --> 00:58:29,790
Stop interrogating her.
Who cares if it's a guy or a girl?

844
00:58:30,790 --> 00:58:34,790
Geez, I don't know where the hell
she's off to, all the time.

845
00:58:35,290 --> 00:58:38,290
Don't worry about Bo Ra.
She'll take care of herself.

846
00:58:38,290 --> 00:58:40,790
She's a smart one, after all.

847
00:58:40,790 --> 00:58:46,290
If she were any smarter,
she'd be bossing us around.

848
00:58:46,290 --> 00:58:47,290
<i>[Jewelry Store]</i>

849
00:58:57,790 --> 00:58:58,790
Taek!

850
00:58:59,790 --> 00:59:01,290
Good night!
I'm off to bed!

851
00:59:01,290 --> 00:59:03,790
Yes!
Good night!

852
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:07,290
- Good night, Mister!
- Good night, Mister!

853
00:59:27,790 --> 00:59:28,790
Sun Woo.

854
00:59:29,790 --> 00:59:30,790
What?

855
00:59:31,790 --> 00:59:33,790
Switch spots with me.

856
00:59:33,790 --> 00:59:36,790
No! I want to sleep next to Taek.

857
00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:38,290
He's so nice and toasty.

858
00:59:38,790 --> 00:59:40,790
He's the perfect person to cuddle with.

859
00:59:41,790 --> 00:59:43,290
It's not that...

860
00:59:46,290 --> 00:59:48,290
This bastard farted again.

861
00:59:49,290 --> 00:59:51,790
Geez... why do you keep doing that?

862
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:53,790
Ew! It smells!

863
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:54,790
Ew!

864
00:59:54,790 --> 00:59:56,290
Hey, hey, hey!

865
00:59:56,290 --> 00:59:59,790
Why do you always do this? Damn it!

866
01:00:00,790 --> 01:00:02,790
She's not asking for me?

867
01:00:03,290 --> 01:00:04,790
Oh.

868
01:00:04,790 --> 01:00:08,790
She could be indigested,
so don't feed her anything.

869
01:00:09,790 --> 01:00:10,790
Okay.

870
01:00:10,790 --> 01:00:13,290
Okay. I'll go first thing,
tomorrow morning.

871
01:00:13,290 --> 01:00:14,290
Okay.

872
01:00:17,790 --> 01:00:18,790
Damn it...

873
01:00:22,790 --> 01:00:24,790
What is it?
Did Jin Joo wake up?

874
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:39,540
What is it?
Did Jin Joo wake up?

875
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:09,400
I can just go tomorrow, you know.

876
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:11,930
You probably won't
be able to sleep all night.

877
01:01:11,930 --> 01:01:16,930
Even if I went to my upperclassman's,
we would've just partied all night.

878
01:01:17,550 --> 01:01:18,930
Get in.

879
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:23,430
Hurry up and get in!

880
01:01:25,430 --> 01:01:26,930
It's cold!

881
01:01:27,210 --> 01:01:29,430
Oh, okay. Okay.

882
01:01:52,430 --> 01:01:54,430
Would you like to
listen to some music?

883
01:01:54,430 --> 01:01:56,430
Can we?

884
01:01:56,430 --> 01:01:59,930
I'll turn it on.
You focus on driving.

885
01:02:07,930 --> 01:02:09,930
It's a song you like, huh?

886
01:02:09,930 --> 01:02:13,930
<i>Even in bitter, stinging winds...</i>

887
01:02:13,930 --> 01:02:17,930
<i>Even in the face of bitter oppression...</i>

888
01:02:17,930 --> 01:02:23,930
<i>Even so, we gathered together!
We stood face-to-face!</i>

889
01:02:23,930 --> 01:02:25,930
Second verse!

890
01:02:25,930 --> 01:02:32,930
<i>Love, eternal love...
my unchanging comrade!</i>

891
01:02:32,930 --> 01:02:39,430
<i>Love, eternal love...
you are my comrade!</i>

892
01:02:39,430 --> 01:02:40,930
Aw, yeah!

893
01:02:53,430 --> 01:02:56,930
Bonggie. Call Dad and tell him
to come eat dinner.

894
01:02:57,220 --> 01:02:58,930
Yes.

895
01:02:59,490 --> 01:03:03,110
<i>It has been very harmonious in Korea...</i>

896
01:03:08,430 --> 01:03:09,430
Yes.

897
01:03:12,430 --> 01:03:14,930
He asks what we'll be having
as side dishes for dinner.

898
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:16,930
Meat.

899
01:03:18,430 --> 01:03:19,930
She says "meat," Father.

900
01:03:22,930 --> 01:03:26,930
"What kind of meat?
Beef? Pork?"

901
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:31,930
Beef! Beef! Beef! Beef! I bought beef!
Hurry up and come home.

902
01:03:32,430 --> 01:03:34,430
<i>Now, for the weather forecast.</i>

903
01:03:34,430 --> 01:03:36,930
<i>It seems that today,
the first Wednesday of November</i>

904
01:03:36,930 --> 01:03:38,930
<i>will also be the first day
of snow this year.</i>

905
01:03:38,930 --> 01:03:43,750
<i>We are predicting that
there will be heavy snowfall.</i>

906
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:44,930
I'm back from school!

907
01:03:44,930 --> 01:03:47,430
Yes. Hurry and get washed up for dinner.

908
01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:48,430
Okay.

909
01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:51,930
I'm home.

910
01:03:51,930 --> 01:03:53,430
You're home, my son?

911
01:03:53,430 --> 01:03:55,430
Hurry and get washed up.
I bought beef today.

912
01:03:55,430 --> 01:03:57,430
You haven't been eating lately.

913
01:03:57,430 --> 01:03:59,430
No, thank you.
My stomach doesn't feel good.

914
01:03:59,430 --> 01:04:00,930
I'll go wash up.

915
01:04:02,430 --> 01:04:03,430
Huh?

916
01:04:09,430 --> 01:04:11,930
<i>All right, shall we read
some stories, then?</i>

917
01:04:11,930 --> 01:04:12,930
Yes!

918
01:04:12,930 --> 01:04:14,930
<i>It may be because
Christmas is coming up</i>

919
01:04:14,930 --> 01:04:17,930
<i>but we're getting
a lot of love-related ones lately.</i>

920
01:04:17,930 --> 01:04:19,930
<i>This is the first one.</i>

921
01:04:19,930 --> 01:04:24,410
<i>I'm Lee Ji Eun,
from Myunmokdong.</i>

922
01:04:24,410 --> 01:04:26,930
<i>Duk Seon!
Set the table!</i>

923
01:04:26,930 --> 01:04:28,430
Okay!

924
01:04:35,930 --> 01:04:39,430
Wow!
It really looks like it'll snow.

925
01:04:39,430 --> 01:04:41,430
Geez... so cold!

926
01:04:50,930 --> 01:04:53,430
Younger Brother!
Snow--

927
01:04:59,430 --> 01:05:03,430
It might snow tonight.
If it does, wake me up.

928
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:07,930
I really want to see
the first snowfall of the year.

929
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:35,930
Oh, geez...

930
01:05:36,430 --> 01:05:39,430
please, just read mine, just once!

931
01:05:40,430 --> 01:05:41,480
Duk Seon!

932
01:05:43,570 --> 01:05:44,930
Sung Duk Seon!

933
01:05:57,930 --> 01:06:00,430
Oh... it's you, Sun Woo?

934
01:06:01,430 --> 01:06:02,930
Come in.

935
01:06:02,930 --> 01:06:04,430
No, that's okay.

936
01:06:04,930 --> 01:06:06,430
What is it?

937
01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:09,430
Is Bo Ra here?

938
01:06:09,430 --> 01:06:11,140
Who?
Sung Bo Ra?

939
01:06:11,140 --> 01:06:13,430
She's not here.

940
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:18,430
Why are you looking for her?

941
01:06:21,430 --> 01:06:23,430
It's... snowing.

942
01:06:24,430 --> 01:06:25,430
Huh?

943
01:07:07,310 --> 01:07:09,930
Sun Woo, just a moment.

944
01:07:09,930 --> 01:07:10,930
I'll bring it quickly.

945
01:07:10,930 --> 01:07:11,930
Okay.

946
01:07:34,930 --> 01:07:36,430
Bo Ra!

947
01:07:36,430 --> 01:07:39,320
Oh, Sun Woo. Did you come to
borrow something again?

948
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:41,430
Just some lead pencil lead.

949
01:08:26,550 --> 01:08:28,430
What are you looking at?

950
01:08:28,430 --> 01:08:29,930
Did you come to watch over me?

951
01:08:29,930 --> 01:08:30,930
<i>No.</i>

952
01:08:31,430 --> 01:08:34,430
I just wanted to know
if you were okay.

953
01:08:37,630 --> 01:08:38,930
Sun Woo.

954
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:41,930
Here. A sewing kit.

955
01:08:41,930 --> 01:08:43,930
That's mine.

956
01:08:44,850 --> 01:08:47,430
You think she'd have a sewing kit?

957
01:08:47,430 --> 01:08:49,430
Borrow it from the
right person next time.

958
01:08:49,430 --> 01:08:51,930
You're a frustrating kid.

959
01:08:51,930 --> 01:08:54,930
How did you manage to become
student council president?

960
01:10:10,430 --> 01:10:11,930
Hey!

961
01:10:11,930 --> 01:10:13,430
Stop right there.

962
01:10:16,930 --> 01:10:17,930
Why?

963
01:10:17,930 --> 01:10:19,430
Why is it Sung Bo Ra,
of all people?

964
01:10:19,430 --> 01:10:21,430
Why her?

965
01:10:22,430 --> 01:10:23,930
Because I like her.

966
01:10:23,930 --> 01:10:24,930
What part of her?

967
01:10:24,930 --> 01:10:26,430
What part of her do you like?

968
01:10:26,430 --> 01:10:27,620
She's pretty.

969
01:10:27,620 --> 01:10:28,680
My ass.

970
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:30,120
And she's smart.

971
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:31,120
Oh my God.

972
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:32,550
And she's kind.

973
01:10:32,550 --> 01:10:34,430
You crazy bastard...

974
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:36,930
I think that even the mole
next to her eye is pretty.

975
01:10:36,930 --> 01:10:38,430
I made that for her!

976
01:10:38,430 --> 01:10:41,430
I stabbed her with
a lead pencil there once!

977
01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:48,930
Oh my God!
Why does it have to be her? Why?

978
01:10:54,930 --> 01:10:56,200
Ow! Hey!

979
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:58,930
I'm never seeing you again.

980
01:12:01,930 --> 01:12:04,390
What are you going to do if you
keep starving yourself like this?

981
01:12:04,390 --> 01:12:07,250
You're really not hungry?
Want me to make you ramen, or something?

982
01:12:07,250 --> 01:12:08,430
Yes, please.

983
01:12:08,930 --> 01:12:10,430
Ramyun.

984
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:13,930
Ramyun.

985
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:21,930
<i>Ah, and this is the last story for today.</i>

986
01:12:21,930 --> 01:12:28,430
<i>Honestly, we've been waiting for this day
to be able to read this.</i>

987
01:12:28,430 --> 01:12:30,930
<i>The first snowfall of the year.</i>

988
01:12:31,930 --> 01:12:35,430
<i>I'm sure those of you listening to
"Starry Night"</i>

989
01:12:35,430 --> 01:12:38,930
<i>really want to see
a loved one on a day like this.</i>

990
01:12:38,930 --> 01:12:45,930
<i>But I bet that the person who sent this
feels that way more than anyone.</i>

991
01:12:45,930 --> 01:12:50,430
<i>Sunny from Ssangmundong
sent us this one.</i>

992
01:12:51,430 --> 01:12:53,930
<i>"Hello, Mr. Moon Sae!"</i>

993
01:12:53,930 --> 01:12:58,430
<i>"I'm Ssangmundong Sunny,
who is love-sick from her first love."</i>

994
01:12:58,430 --> 01:13:02,930
<i>"I have a crush on someone
living in my neighborhood."</i>

995
01:13:02,930 --> 01:13:05,930
<i>"And that guy likes me, too."</i>

996
01:13:05,930 --> 01:13:11,430
<i>"But... I haven't received
a confession from him yet."</i>

997
01:13:11,430 --> 01:13:16,930
<i>"Since he's such a shy guy, he doesn't
seem to be able to muster the courage."</i>

998
01:13:16,930 --> 01:13:18,430
<i>"Mr. Moon Sae."</i>

999
01:13:18,430 --> 01:13:23,430
<i>"My wish is for him to be confessed to
on the day it first snows."</i>

1000
01:13:23,430 --> 01:13:27,930
<i>"So please read my postcard
on the day of the first snow, okay?"</i>

1001
01:13:27,930 --> 01:13:32,930
<i>"That's because, even if
I'm not confessed to on that day"</i>

1002
01:13:32,930 --> 01:13:38,430
<i>"this will be broadcast all over the
country, which will console me a bit."</i>

1003
01:13:38,430 --> 01:13:43,430
<i>"Oh... of course, if I'm confessed to
and my postcard is read..."</i>

1004
01:13:43,430 --> 01:13:44,930
<i>"that would be even better!"</i>

1005
01:13:44,930 --> 01:13:50,430
<i>"Mr. Moon, please pray with me
that my first love works out."</i>

1006
01:13:50,430 --> 01:13:52,430
<i>"I'll put all my faith in you!"</i>

1007
01:13:53,430 --> 01:13:55,430
<i>Wow, that's a lot of pressure.</i>

1008
01:13:55,430 --> 01:13:58,930
<i>It's nice that you believe in me, but...</i>

1009
01:13:58,930 --> 01:14:00,930
<i>Wow.</i>

1010
01:14:00,930 --> 01:14:06,430
<i>I think a lot of people feel the
same way as Ssangmundong Sunny.</i>

1011
01:14:06,430 --> 01:14:11,930
<i>Ssangmundong Sunny,
you know that it's snowing now, right?</i>

1012
01:14:12,930 --> 01:14:16,930
<i>Did you get confessed to?
I'm really curious.</i>

1013
01:14:17,930 --> 01:14:20,930
<i>I wonder what it feels like to
be confessed to from your first love</i>

1014
01:14:20,930 --> 01:14:22,430
<i>on the first day of snow of the year.</i>

1015
01:14:22,430 --> 01:14:26,930
<i>I bet she'd be the
happiest person on the planet.</i>

1016
01:14:27,930 --> 01:14:29,930
<i>That's what I think.</i>

1017
01:14:29,930 --> 01:14:33,930
<i>Just like that beautiful
first snowfall outside</i>

1018
01:14:33,930 --> 01:14:38,930
<i>I hope that you all nurture
a beautiful love.</i>

1019
01:14:42,430 --> 01:14:44,930
<i>Listeners of "Starry Night..."
do you know this?</i>

1020
01:14:44,930 --> 01:14:47,930
<i>They say that the chances
of your confession succeeding</i>

1021
01:14:47,930 --> 01:14:50,930
<i>increase to over 90 percent on
the first day of snow of the year.</i>

1022
01:14:50,930 --> 01:14:54,930
<i>I wonder if it's because of
the romantic atmosphere it creates.</i>

1023
01:14:55,430 --> 01:14:58,930
<i>If you love someone right now...</i>

1024
01:14:59,430 --> 01:15:02,930
<i>and you're wondering whether or not
you should confess...</i>

1025
01:15:02,930 --> 01:15:05,930
<i>tonight's your chance.</i>

1026
01:15:05,930 --> 01:15:08,430
<i>Muster up your courage and confess.</i>

1027
01:15:08,430 --> 01:15:09,430
Bo Ra!

1028
01:15:09,930 --> 01:15:13,430
<i>Well, though there's over
a 90 percent chance of success...</i>

1029
01:15:13,430 --> 01:15:19,430
<i>the remaining 10 percent...
has you relying on sheer luck.</i>

1030
01:15:19,430 --> 01:15:21,930
<i>You'll have to leave it to chance.</i>

1031
01:15:21,930 --> 01:15:22,930
<i>Yes. Well.</i>

1032
01:15:22,930 --> 01:15:24,930
<i>Have strength.</i>

1033
01:15:24,930 --> 01:15:26,430
Where have you been?

1034
01:15:26,430 --> 01:15:28,430
I had to go to the countryside for a bit.

1035
01:15:28,430 --> 01:15:30,930
Dressed like this?

1036
01:15:30,930 --> 01:15:33,430
Damn. Speaking of which,
I'm so cold, I could die.

1037
01:15:33,430 --> 01:15:35,430
Why?
Is something the matter?

1038
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:36,930
What are you doing here?

1039
01:15:37,930 --> 01:15:39,930
I was waiting for you.

1040
01:15:42,140 --> 01:15:43,430
For me?

1041
01:15:44,390 --> 01:15:45,930
Why?

1042
01:15:45,930 --> 01:15:47,930
Because I have something
to talk to you about.

1043
01:15:49,430 --> 01:15:50,930
Go ahead, then.

1044
01:15:51,930 --> 01:15:53,030
I'm really going to say it.

1045
01:15:53,030 --> 01:15:54,430
Sure.
Go ahead.

1046
01:15:56,410 --> 01:15:58,430
I like you.

1047
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:10,930
I said, I like you.

1048
01:16:13,870 --> 01:16:17,930
<i>I hope that everyone who confesses
today has their love come true.</i>

1049
01:16:17,930 --> 01:16:20,430
<i>And, by any chance, if there is anyone</i>

1050
01:16:20,430 --> 01:16:24,430
<i>who hasn't been confessed to
by the one they love yet...</i>

1051
01:16:24,430 --> 01:16:29,930
<i>or, if you're suffering from
love-related pains...</i>

1052
01:16:29,930 --> 01:16:31,930
<i>don't be too sad.</i>

1053
01:16:32,430 --> 01:16:36,430
<i>Another person may be
in love with you, right now.</i>

1054
01:16:39,930 --> 01:16:41,430
Hello?

1055
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:44,430
Oh! Why are you calling at this hour?

1056
01:16:44,930 --> 01:16:46,930
Oh, okay.
Hold on.

1057
01:16:47,930 --> 01:16:49,930
Duk Seon, pick up the phone!

1058
01:16:49,930 --> 01:16:52,430
<i>And they may just confess to you</i>

1059
01:16:52,430 --> 01:16:57,930
<i>that they've liked you for a long time,
even though you were totally unaware.</i>

1060
01:16:57,930 --> 01:16:59,390
Hello?

1061
01:16:59,390 --> 01:17:03,930
<i>Wow. Okay.
This is the last song for tonight.</i>

1062
01:17:03,930 --> 01:17:05,930
<i>It suits tonight so well.</i>

1063
01:17:05,930 --> 01:17:09,430
<i>Lee Jung Suk's
"The First Snow is Falling."</i>

1064
01:17:13,930 --> 01:17:15,430
It's me.
Taek.

1065
01:17:15,430 --> 01:17:17,760
<i>Yeah.
Why are you calling so late?</i>

1066
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:19,930
<i>Did something happen?</i>

1067
01:17:20,430 --> 01:17:21,930
No. Nothing like that.

1068
01:17:21,930 --> 01:17:22,930
<i>Oh.</i>

1069
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:25,930
<i>Hurry and go home.
Go home and sleep.</i>

1070
01:17:25,930 --> 01:17:27,430
<i>It's almost midnight.</i>

1071
01:17:27,430 --> 01:17:28,930
Okay.

1072
01:17:30,430 --> 01:17:31,430
Duk Seon.

1073
01:17:32,930 --> 01:17:34,430
<i>Yeah, what is it?</i>

1074
01:17:36,430 --> 01:17:39,430
Shall we... go see a movie?

1075
01:17:43,110 --> 01:17:45,430
Let's go see a movie.

1076
01:17:45,430 --> 01:17:46,430
The two of us.

1077
01:18:01,930 --> 01:18:05,930
<i>[November 2015]</i>

1078
01:18:05,930 --> 01:18:08,430
Big Sis!
Come on!

1079
01:18:10,930 --> 01:18:14,430
Hey, just let me off the hook.

1080
01:18:14,430 --> 01:18:15,930
I can't smoke at home.

1081
01:18:15,930 --> 01:18:17,700
I can only smoke here.

1082
01:18:17,700 --> 01:18:18,930
Then go smoke outside.

1083
01:18:18,930 --> 01:18:20,430
Out on the porch.

1084
01:18:20,430 --> 01:18:23,050
Geez! You punk...

1085
01:18:23,050 --> 01:18:24,930
It's your phone.

1086
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:27,650
It's your husband.

1087
01:18:27,650 --> 01:18:29,930
It's a video call.

1088
01:18:30,930 --> 01:18:33,930
Hey...

1089
01:18:33,930 --> 01:18:35,430
Sorry, sorry.

1090
01:18:36,930 --> 01:18:37,930
Honey!

1091
01:18:38,430 --> 01:18:40,430
Why are you calling so late?

1092
01:18:40,930 --> 01:18:42,930
I'm at Duk Seon's.

1093
01:18:43,930 --> 01:18:44,930
See?

1094
01:18:45,930 --> 01:18:46,930
Duk Seon!

1095
01:18:46,930 --> 01:18:48,930
It's snowing!

1096
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:51,430
You're right.

1097
01:18:51,930 --> 01:18:52,930
Honey!

1098
01:18:52,930 --> 01:18:54,270
Jae Woo is with me, too.

1099
01:18:54,270 --> 01:18:55,930
Hey!

1100
01:18:55,930 --> 01:18:58,930
It's snowing! Hurry over!
You come too, honey.

1101
01:18:58,930 --> 01:19:00,930
I miss you!

1102
01:19:03,930 --> 01:19:06,930
The thing I remember most
when you say, "First snow?"

1103
01:19:06,930 --> 01:19:08,430
When you got rejected by Sun Woo?

1104
01:19:08,930 --> 01:19:10,930
In 1988?

1105
01:19:10,930 --> 01:19:14,430
She was writing so many postcards
to "Starry Night" and stuff...

1106
01:19:14,430 --> 01:19:15,930
She put on quite a show.

1107
01:19:15,930 --> 01:19:18,930
- Geez.
- How do you know that?

1108
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:22,160
Did I tell you, by any chance?

1109
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:24,430
There's nothing I don't know about you.

1110
01:19:24,430 --> 01:19:26,430
Be good to me.

1111
01:19:26,930 --> 01:19:28,990
It's because it's me that
I'm so accepting of all this.

1112
01:19:28,990 --> 01:19:30,640
Where else would you
find a husband like me?

1113
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:31,930
Don't be ridiculous.

1114
01:19:31,930 --> 01:19:34,930
Want to talk about all the people you
dated before we got married?

1115
01:19:34,930 --> 01:19:36,430
We could spend all night doing that!

1116
01:19:36,430 --> 01:19:38,930
Hey, but in '88...

1117
01:19:39,430 --> 01:19:41,430
wasn't that when
they did the singing contest?

1118
01:19:41,430 --> 01:19:42,930
Was that at the gymnasium?

1119
01:19:42,930 --> 01:19:44,930
And just who did you take to that?

1120
01:19:45,430 --> 01:19:48,430
No... we went there with everyone else!

1121
01:19:48,430 --> 01:19:51,430
I saw it on TV at home!

1122
01:19:51,430 --> 01:19:52,930
No. We went and saw it.

1123
01:19:52,930 --> 01:19:56,180
Who won the award that year, again?
Jeon Yoo Na's "That Thing Called Love?"

1124
01:19:56,180 --> 01:19:57,930
That was in '89!

1125
01:19:57,930 --> 01:20:00,930
In '88, it was Endless Orbit's
"To That Person!"

1126
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:03,430
Oh...

1127
01:20:03,930 --> 01:20:05,430
No. It was Jeon Yoo Na.

1128
01:20:05,430 --> 01:20:08,430
I told you, it was Endless Orbit!

1129
01:20:40,430 --> 01:20:42,430
<i>Should we bet on it?</i>

1130
01:20:42,430 --> 01:20:44,430
<i>Everyone puts in 1,000 won,
and winner takes all.</i>

1131
01:20:49,930 --> 01:20:51,430
<i>Merry Christmas
in advance.</i>

1132
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:53,930
<i>See you on Christmas Eve, okay?</i>

1133
01:20:53,930 --> 01:20:56,430
<i>Then, this year, the gift for the
kids in this neighborhood will be...</i>

1134
01:20:56,430 --> 01:20:59,430
<i>I don't have any of that.</i>

1135
01:20:59,430 --> 01:21:01,430
<i>Oh my, oh my!</i>

1136
01:21:02,930 --> 01:21:04,930
<i>Hurry up and apologize!</i>

1137
01:21:04,930 --> 01:21:06,930
<i>Why do I need to apologize
over something like that?</i>

1138
01:21:07,930 --> 01:21:10,930
<i>Just try and stop me.</i>

1139
01:21:12,430 --> 01:21:15,930
<i>What's with the mood today,
when it's Christmas?</i>

1140
01:21:15,930 --> 01:21:18,430
<i>What, what is it?</i>

1141
01:21:18,430 --> 01:21:20,430
<i>Did something huge happen?</i>

1142
01:21:24,930 --> 01:21:26,930
<i>Don't tell anyone what happened today.</i>

1143
01:21:26,930 --> 01:21:27,930
<i>Got it?</i>

1144
01:21:29,430 --> 01:21:31,430
<i>I have something to talk to you about.</i>

1145
01:21:31,430 --> 01:21:32,430
<i>With me?</i>

1146
01:21:32,430 --> 01:21:33,930
<i>What?
What is it now?</i>

1147
01:21:33,930 --> 01:21:34,930
<i>Damn you!</i>

1148
01:21:35,430 --> 01:21:39,430
<i>Let's do Secret Santa!</i>

1149
01:21:39,930 --> 01:21:41,430
<i>I got you, Jung Bong.</i>

1150
01:21:41,930 --> 01:21:44,430
<i>You're... my Secret Santa, right?</i>

1151
01:21:44,430 --> 01:21:45,430
<i>Geez!</i>

1152
01:21:45,430 --> 01:21:46,930
<i>I don't even have a Secret Santa.</i>

1153
01:21:47,430 --> 01:21:49,930
<i>I don't deserve to be loved.</i>

1154
01:21:54,930 --> 01:21:56,430
<i>Then, see you on Christmas day.</i>

1155
01:21:56,430 --> 01:21:58,430
<i>Don't fall asleep.</i>

1156
