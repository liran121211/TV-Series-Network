359
00:16:43,882 --> 00:16:45,881
- Well, now you can relax,
my ducky duck.

360
00:16:45,882 --> 00:16:47,881
You've earned
a good nights rest.

361
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:48,881
- Good night, guys!

362
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,881
- Both: [Screams]

363
00:16:50,882 --> 00:16:51,882
- Whoa my gosh.

364
00:16:52,882 --> 00:16:53,882
Buhdeuce,
look at that nest.

365
00:16:54,882 --> 00:16:54,882
- What?

366
00:16:54,883 --> 00:16:56,881
- Let me fixify it
for you.

367
00:16:56,882 --> 00:16:58,881
- No, no, no, no, no,
please!

368
00:16:58,882 --> 00:16:59,882
Not my nest!

369
00:17:03,882 --> 00:17:08,882
- Ta-da-di-da!
The comfy bed 12000.

370
00:17:09,882 --> 00:17:10,882
State-of-the-art
hydraulics guaranteed

371
00:17:11,882 --> 00:17:13,881
to gently sooth you
to sleep.

372
00:17:13,882 --> 00:17:17,881
- Wasn't that thoughtful
of our guest, buhdeuce?

373
00:17:17,882 --> 00:17:20,881
Go ahead.
Give it a try.

374
00:17:20,882 --> 00:17:23,881
- [Chuckles]
It's great.

375
00:17:23,882 --> 00:17:25,881
- Welp, g'night guys.

376
00:17:25,882 --> 00:17:28,881
Don't let
the bread bugs bite.

377
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:29,882
- Whew. See, bap?

378
00:17:30,882 --> 00:17:31,881
That didn't turn out so bad,
now did it?

379
00:17:31,882 --> 00:17:33,881
- Yeah, you know, I--

380
00:17:33,882 --> 00:17:35,882
[grunting]

381
00:17:42,882 --> 00:17:47,881
- Both: [Screaming]

382
00:17:47,882 --> 00:17:53,881
- Quack-a-doodle-do!

383
00:17:53,882 --> 00:17:57,881
- Both: [Sighing]

384
00:17:57,882 --> 00:17:59,881
- I can't take it
any more, bap!

385
00:17:59,882 --> 00:18:03,881
Ketta's inventions
are driving me quazy!

386
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:04,882
- Easy, deucer.

387
00:18:05,882 --> 00:18:07,881
I know just the thing to
un-ruffle your feathers.

388
00:18:07,882 --> 00:18:10,881
A fun-filled game
of ducky Kong!

389
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:12,881
- Yeah! Ducky Kong!

390
00:18:12,882 --> 00:18:14,881
- Correction!

391
00:18:14,882 --> 00:18:19,881
Ducky Kong 15000!

392
00:18:19,882 --> 00:18:21,881
I fixified your game.

393
00:18:21,882 --> 00:18:25,881
The graphics are so good now
you'll think they're real.

394
00:18:25,882 --> 00:18:27,881
- Ducky punch!

395
00:18:27,882 --> 00:18:29,881
- Ow!

396
00:18:29,882 --> 00:18:31,882
- Oh and by the way,
in order to upgrade your game,

397
00:18:32,882 --> 00:18:33,881
I had to reset
all your high-scores.

398
00:18:33,882 --> 00:18:36,881
- Rika-rika-reset?

399
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:38,881
But it took me
ten years

400
00:18:38,882 --> 00:18:41,881
to reach my high score!

401
00:18:41,882 --> 00:18:43,882
Ten years!

402
00:18:44,882 --> 00:18:47,881
Quack-quackity-quack-quack-
quack-quack-quack!

403
00:18:47,882 --> 00:18:49,881
Stupid...Fixifying...
For gooses' sake..

404
00:18:49,882 --> 00:18:51,881
- Easy, swaysway!

405
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:53,881
Our guest was just trying
to help!

406
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,881
- Worst thing ever! Crummers!

407
00:18:55,882 --> 00:18:58,881
Ketta, we loaf you,

408
00:18:58,882 --> 00:19:01,881
but you're drivin'
us quazy!

409
00:19:01,882 --> 00:19:06,881
- Oh. Sorry, baps.

410
00:19:06,882 --> 00:19:09,881
I'll go find
somewhere else to stay.

411
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:12,881
Maybe under a dark,
cold rock somewhere.

412
00:19:12,882 --> 00:19:15,881
- No, ketta, wait!

413
00:19:15,882 --> 00:19:17,881
I didn't mean
to hurt her feelings.

414
00:19:17,882 --> 00:19:19,881
- Poor ketta.

415
00:19:19,882 --> 00:19:21,881
But on the bright side,

416
00:19:21,882 --> 00:19:24,882
I can finally lay an egg
in peace.

417
00:19:28,882 --> 00:19:30,881
- Oh, good going,
ketta.

418
00:19:30,882 --> 00:19:32,881
You had to go
fixifying stuff

419
00:19:32,882 --> 00:19:33,882
that didn't need
fixifying.

420
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:35,881
[Grunts]

421
00:19:35,882 --> 00:19:37,881
- [Growls]
Hey!

422
00:19:37,882 --> 00:19:40,881
Don't throw your garbage
in the swamp!

423
00:19:40,882 --> 00:19:41,881
This is my home!

424
00:19:41,882 --> 00:19:43,881
- Ahh!
- Not a toilet!

425
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:45,881
- Sorry, mister, I just--

426
00:19:45,882 --> 00:19:47,881
[gasps]
Toilet!

427
00:19:47,882 --> 00:19:48,882
Oh, no!

428
00:19:49,882 --> 00:19:53,881
I forgot to tell them that
I fixified the toilet!

429
00:19:53,882 --> 00:19:54,881
- [Sighs]

430
00:19:54,882 --> 00:19:56,881
I shouldn't have lost
my temper at ketta

431
00:19:56,882 --> 00:19:58,881
over a video game.

432
00:19:58,882 --> 00:20:01,881
I'm such a crumbskull.

433
00:20:01,882 --> 00:20:03,881
Aw, jelly.

434
00:20:03,882 --> 00:20:04,881
Thanks for lettin' me share
my feelings with you

435
00:20:04,882 --> 00:20:06,881
while buhdeuce
takes a poop.

436
00:20:06,882 --> 00:20:07,881
- Ahh! Ugh!

437
00:20:07,882 --> 00:20:12,881
We're out
of toilet paper.

438
00:20:12,882 --> 00:20:16,881
- Thank you for using
robo toilet 30000.

439
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,881
- Run!

440
00:20:18,882 --> 00:20:21,881
- Total flush mode initiated.

441
00:20:21,882 --> 00:20:26,881
Flush, flush.
Flush, flush.

442
00:20:26,882 --> 00:20:30,881
- Why do ketta's inventions
always have to backfire?

443
00:20:30,882 --> 00:20:31,881
- I don't know.

444
00:20:31,882 --> 00:20:33,881
But maybe
her inventions

445
00:20:33,882 --> 00:20:35,881
are just what
we need right now!

446
00:20:35,882 --> 00:20:36,881
Both: [Grunting]

447
00:20:36,882 --> 00:20:39,881
- Flush, flush, flush.

448
00:20:39,882 --> 00:20:42,881
- Toilet, you about
to get clogged.

449
00:20:42,882 --> 00:20:44,881
[Grunts]

450
00:20:44,882 --> 00:20:46,882
[Screams]

451
00:20:47,882 --> 00:20:50,881
Deucer, the vacbot!

452
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:53,882
- Flush this.

453
00:20:54,882 --> 00:20:58,881
- Activate overflow blast.

454
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:01,881
Both: [Grunting]

455
00:21:01,882 --> 00:21:04,881
- T.P. Torpedo.

456
00:21:04,882 --> 00:21:07,882
Both: Ahh!

457
00:21:08,882 --> 00:21:09,881
- Nothing can stop
that thing!

458
00:21:09,882 --> 00:21:13,881
- Lives, you about to get
flushed down the toilet.

459
00:21:13,882 --> 00:21:17,881
- Flush, flush, flush, flush.

460
00:21:17,882 --> 00:21:19,881
- Sic 'em, girl!

461
00:21:19,882 --> 00:21:21,092
- Both: Whoa!

462
00:21:31,882 --> 00:21:35,881
- [Growls]

463
00:21:35,882 --> 00:21:36,882
- Sorry, guys.

464
00:21:37,882 --> 00:21:38,881
This was
all my fault.

465
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:41,881
- Ketta, you are
totally right.

466
00:21:41,882 --> 00:21:42,881
- Don't be riduckulous.

467
00:21:42,882 --> 00:21:44,881
Ketta, your
dangerous inventions

468
00:21:44,882 --> 00:21:48,881
are what saved us from
your dangerous inventions!

469
00:21:48,882 --> 00:21:50,881
- Aw, thanks.

470
00:21:50,882 --> 00:21:52,881
But the swamp pad's
a total wreck.

471
00:21:52,882 --> 00:21:55,881
Now where are we
all gonna stay?

472
00:21:55,882 --> 00:21:57,881
Both: Good night, ketta.

473
00:21:57,882 --> 00:21:59,882
- Good night, baps.
