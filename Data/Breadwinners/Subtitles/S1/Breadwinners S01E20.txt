00:13:58,021 --> 00:14:00,020
Oh-oh-oh-oh!

360
00:14:00,021 --> 00:14:02,021
[all screaming]

361
00:14:03,021 --> 00:14:05,020
Lava balls!
Quick--

362
00:14:05,021 --> 00:14:07,021
use your umbrella bread!

363
00:14:08,021 --> 00:14:11,020
Hey, I wasn't supposed
to eat this?

364
00:14:11,021 --> 00:14:12,020
Aah!

365
00:14:12,021 --> 00:14:14,020
Buh-buh-buh-booty kick,
booty kick,

366
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:16,021
booty kick!

367
00:14:23,021 --> 00:14:26,020
See? That wasn't
so bad, was it?

368
00:14:26,021 --> 00:14:28,021
[everyone groaning, moaning]

369
00:14:30,021 --> 00:14:31,021
[quacking]

370
00:14:33,021 --> 00:14:35,020
[quacking]

371
00:14:35,021 --> 00:14:38,020
Looks like
they gave up.

372
00:14:38,021 --> 00:14:41,020
Guess they just weren't
Breadwinner material.

373
00:14:41,021 --> 00:14:44,020
Buhdeuce! Way to use
your booty back there.

374
00:14:44,021 --> 00:14:45,020
Nice work, bap.

375
00:14:45,021 --> 00:14:48,021
Oh, my bap.
He called me bap!

376
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:50,020
Now, to mine bread,

377
00:14:50,021 --> 00:14:52,021
you just whack your ax
up and down.

378
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:57,020
Yep. Just like that.

379
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,020
Up and down.

380
00:14:59,021 --> 00:15:00,020
Now faster.

381
00:15:00,021 --> 00:15:02,020
Faster!

382
00:15:02,021 --> 00:15:03,020
This is easy!

383
00:15:03,021 --> 00:15:06,020
Especially for someone
as athletic as me.

384
00:15:06,021 --> 00:15:07,020
Oh, hey, before
I forget...

385
00:15:07,021 --> 00:15:09,021
rule number six
of being a Breadwinner--

386
00:15:09,022 --> 00:15:12,020
try not to get eaten
by monsters.

387
00:15:12,021 --> 00:15:14,020
[roaring]

388
00:15:14,021 --> 00:15:16,020
- Like that--don't do that.
- Aah!

389
00:15:16,021 --> 00:15:17,020
Oh!
Some...

390
00:15:17,021 --> 00:15:18,020
body...

391
00:15:18,021 --> 00:15:20,020
help...me!

392
00:15:20,021 --> 00:15:22,020
Quick--does anyone know
how to perform

393
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:24,020
a buddy toss?

394
00:15:24,021 --> 00:15:26,021
Yip, yip, I know,
I know!

395
00:15:28,021 --> 00:15:32,020
Whoa! I can't believe
this is really happening!

396
00:15:32,021 --> 00:15:35,021
Buh-buh-buh-buh buddy toss!

397
00:15:37,021 --> 00:15:39,020
He buddy tossed me!

398
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,020
He totally
buddy tossed me.

399
00:15:40,021 --> 00:15:43,020
It's like we're born
to be best baps!

400
00:15:43,021 --> 00:15:44,020
Don't worry, Thon.

401
00:15:44,021 --> 00:15:46,020
Breadwinners only get
attacked by monsters

402
00:15:46,021 --> 00:15:48,020
two, three times a day...
tops!

403
00:15:48,021 --> 00:15:51,021
Oh! I give up.

404
00:15:54,021 --> 00:15:56,020
Now that we've mined
the bread,

405
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:58,020
it's time to get it up
to the hangar

406
00:15:58,021 --> 00:15:59,020
with a little suckage.

407
00:15:59,021 --> 00:16:00,020
[click]
[whirring]

408
00:16:00,021 --> 00:16:02,020
[foom foom foom foom]

409
00:16:02,021 --> 00:16:04,020
Easy peasy.

410
00:16:04,021 --> 00:16:06,020
[foom foom foom foom]

411
00:16:06,021 --> 00:16:07,020
Bye-bye,
Bubblegum Rye!

412
00:16:07,021 --> 00:16:08,020
Ciao!

413
00:16:08,021 --> 00:16:10,021
[foom foom foom]

414
00:16:12,021 --> 00:16:14,020
Oh, boy.

415
00:16:14,021 --> 00:16:16,020
Eee hee hee hee!

416
00:16:16,021 --> 00:16:18,020
- Help!
- I have to admit...

417
00:16:18,021 --> 00:16:20,020
aside from having
to risk your beak 24-7,

418
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:22,020
being a Breadwinner
is a blast!

419
00:16:22,021 --> 00:16:24,020
- Help!
- And the best part

420
00:16:24,021 --> 00:16:26,020
is that Breadwinners
are best baps for life.

421
00:16:26,021 --> 00:16:28,020
That's exactly what I want!

422
00:16:28,021 --> 00:16:30,020
And, as best baps,

423
00:16:30,021 --> 00:16:32,020
we'll share adventures,
we'll share meals,

424
00:16:32,021 --> 00:16:33,020
we'll share the bathroom.

425
00:16:33,021 --> 00:16:35,020
We'll even share
a toothbrush!

426
00:16:35,021 --> 00:16:38,020
It's been in my family
for generations.

427
00:16:38,021 --> 00:16:41,020
Uh...you know?
On second thought,

428
00:16:41,021 --> 00:16:42,021
I give up.

429
00:16:44,021 --> 00:16:46,020
Ah. Another one
bites the crust.

430
00:16:46,021 --> 00:16:48,021
[machine whirring]
- Aah--whoa--

431
00:16:50,021 --> 00:16:52,021
Going up!

432
00:16:54,021 --> 00:16:56,020
Well, looks like
you're the only one left.

433
00:16:56,021 --> 00:16:59,020
- Aah!
- I guess even that crazy

434
00:16:59,021 --> 00:17:00,020
little dude Buhdeuce gave up.

435
00:17:00,021 --> 00:17:02,020
(Buhdeuce)
No, I didn't!

436
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,020
I liked him, too.

437
00:17:03,021 --> 00:17:05,021
(Buhdeuce)
I like you too!

438
00:17:07,021 --> 00:17:08,020
So what's your name
anyway?

439
00:17:08,021 --> 00:17:11,020
- [quack]
- Well, Doug, congratulations.

440
00:17:11,021 --> 00:17:13,020
I know you'll make
a great Breadwinner.

441
00:17:13,021 --> 00:17:17,020
[harp music]

442
00:17:17,021 --> 00:17:18,020
[quack]

443
00:17:18,021 --> 00:17:20,020
Whoa--oh!

444
00:17:20,021 --> 00:17:21,020
[groaning]

445
00:17:21,021 --> 00:17:23,020
Now, let's deliver
some dough, yo!

446
00:17:23,021 --> 00:17:26,021
Next up, T-Midi's!

447
00:17:29,021 --> 00:17:31,020
Wait! Don't go!
[coughing]

448
00:17:31,021 --> 00:17:34,020
I just wanted
a best bap!

449
00:17:34,021 --> 00:17:38,021
And he seemed
so best bap worthy.

450
00:17:40,021 --> 00:17:41,020
Aw, thanks, Jelly,

451
00:17:41,021 --> 00:17:43,020
but I can't eat this bread.

452
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:45,020
It's for the delivery
SwaySway's making.

453
00:17:45,021 --> 00:17:47,020
Right now.

454
00:17:47,021 --> 00:17:49,020
Oh, no!

455
00:17:49,021 --> 00:17:51,020
They forgot the bread!

456
00:17:51,021 --> 00:17:53,021
We have to help!

457
00:17:58,021 --> 00:18:00,020
Next stop, T-Midi's!

458
00:18:00,021 --> 00:18:02,021
Legs, don't fail me now!

459
00:18:06,021 --> 00:18:08,020
Okay, my fellow
Breadwinner,

460
00:18:08,021 --> 00:18:09,020
hope you're good
at directions,

461
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:12,020
'cause you're
my navigator now.

462
00:18:12,021 --> 00:18:14,020
[quack quack]

463
00:18:14,021 --> 00:18:16,020
No! Don't...

464
00:18:16,021 --> 00:18:17,020
eat...that!

465
00:18:17,021 --> 00:18:18,939
Aw, crummers.

466
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,021
[swallows]

467
00:18:22,021 --> 00:18:25,020
Never give up, never give up,
never give up!

468
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:29,021
Never give up,
never give up, never give up!

469
00:18:36,021 --> 00:18:38,020
Whoo! Good thing I remembered
how to get here.

470
00:18:38,021 --> 00:18:42,020
Okay. T-Midi was my parents'
number one customer,

471
00:18:42,021 --> 00:18:44,020
and I have to make him
my number one customer.

472
00:18:44,021 --> 00:18:45,021
[quack]

473
00:18:48,021 --> 00:18:51,020
Oh, great.
You again.

474
00:18:51,021 --> 00:18:52,020
Please, T-Midi?

475
00:18:52,021 --> 00:18:54,020
I know I messed up
your last delivery,

476
00:18:54,021 --> 00:18:55,020
so to make it up
to you,

477
00:18:55,021 --> 00:18:57,020
we brought you 100
complimentary loaves

478
00:18:57,021 --> 00:18:59,020
of Huckleberry Spaghetti,
Bubblegum Rye,

479
00:18:59,021 --> 00:19:00,020
and Jelly-Filled Alfalfa.

480
00:19:00,021 --> 00:19:02,020
Really?

481
00:19:02,021 --> 00:19:05,020
Hmm. Well, I'll believe it
when I see it.

482
00:19:05,021 --> 00:19:07,020
Yo, Doug,
bust out the bread!

483
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:09,020
[quack]

484
00:19:09,021 --> 00:19:12,020
What do you mean,
you didn't pack the bread?

485
00:19:12,021 --> 00:19:13,020
Sheesh-a-roo-roo!

486
00:19:13,021 --> 00:19:15,020
[brakes screech]

487
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:16,563
Never...

488
00:19:16,564 --> 00:19:18,020
give...

489
00:19:18,021 --> 00:19:19,021
up!

490
00:19:22,021 --> 00:19:24,020
Never give up, never give up,

491
00:19:24,021 --> 00:19:26,020
never give up,
never give up.

492
00:19:26,021 --> 00:19:28,020
[quacking]

493
00:19:28,021 --> 00:19:29,020
You thought I packed
the bread?

494
00:19:29,021 --> 00:19:32,020
- [quacking]
- I thought you packed it!

495
00:19:32,021 --> 00:19:33,020
This is ri-duckulous!

496
00:19:33,021 --> 00:19:36,020
Find yourself some other
number one customer!

497
00:19:36,021 --> 00:19:37,020
[quack quack]

498
00:19:37,021 --> 00:19:41,020
You give up? Wait!
No, come on!

499
00:19:41,021 --> 00:19:42,020
What about our motto?

500
00:19:42,021 --> 00:19:45,020
[grunting]

501
00:19:45,021 --> 00:19:45,021
Never...

502
00:19:45,022 --> 00:19:47,020
give...

503
00:19:47,021 --> 00:19:49,020
up.
Ahh.

504
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,020
Holy guacamole
on rye!

505
00:19:51,021 --> 00:19:52,020
Buhdeuce!

506
00:19:52,021 --> 00:19:55,020
Hey, bap.
Brought the bread.

507
00:19:55,021 --> 00:19:56,020
Can someone please
tell me

508
00:19:56,021 --> 00:19:59,020
why there's a naked
little duck on my porch?

509
00:19:59,021 --> 00:20:02,020
He's just making sure
your delivery got here.

510
00:20:02,021 --> 00:20:03,020
Here you go, T-Midi!

511
00:20:03,021 --> 00:20:06,020
My name is--

512
00:20:06,021 --> 00:20:09,020
[chomping, smacking lips]

513
00:20:09,021 --> 00:20:11,020
Mmm! Oh, this bread
is so fresh!

514
00:20:11,021 --> 00:20:14,020
Absolutely delicious!
Oh...

515
00:20:14,021 --> 00:20:16,020
Forget what I said.

516
00:20:16,021 --> 00:20:18,020
I'll be your
number one customer

517
00:20:18,021 --> 00:20:20,020
just like I was
with your parents.

518
00:20:20,021 --> 00:20:21,020
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

519
00:20:21,021 --> 00:20:22,020
You did it, man.

520
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:24,020
<i>You</i> never gave up!

521
00:20:24,021 --> 00:20:26,020
Congratulations,
Buhdeuce.

522
00:20:26,021 --> 00:20:29,020
You are officially
a Breadwinner!

523
00:20:29,021 --> 00:20:31,021
And my best bap
for life.

524
00:20:34,021 --> 00:20:36,021
Oh, my ba--

525
00:20:37,021 --> 00:20:40,020
So, uh, this hat come
with pants or something?

526
00:20:40,021 --> 00:20:43,021
[chuckles]
Feelin' a little
exposed here.

527
00:20:45,021 --> 00:20:48,020
Ha! I still can't believe
you did all that naked.

528
00:20:48,021 --> 00:20:51,020
Well, like your great-
great-great times infinity

529
00:20:51,021 --> 00:20:52,020
Grandpa Bear used to say...

530
00:20:52,021 --> 00:20:56,020
Duck naked
is the only way to ride!

531
00:20:56,021 --> 00:21:00,020
Duck naked is
the only way to ride!

532
00:21:00,021 --> 00:21:04,020
That's it! That's how
you ride a Tunnel Eater!

533
00:21:04,021 --> 00:21:06,020
Naked.

534
00:21:06,021 --> 00:21:07,020
Uh...why that is?

535
00:21:07,021 --> 00:21:10,020
Because, man, not even
a Tunnel Eater

536
00:21:10,021 --> 00:21:13,020
can resist the soft,
downy feathers of a duck.

537
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:16,020
