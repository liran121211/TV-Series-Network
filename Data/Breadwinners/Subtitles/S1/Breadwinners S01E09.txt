- Aw, bubble nuggets!

351
00:15:19,382 --> 00:15:21,382
Now we'll never get there
before sundown.

352
00:15:21,382 --> 00:15:23,382
- Deucer, I don't want
to freak you the beak out but,

353
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:26,382
[chomps] You're going to have to
drive the rocket van.

354
00:15:26,382 --> 00:15:29,382
[Gasps]

355
00:15:29,382 --> 00:15:31,382
Yeaaaah, boyeeee!

356
00:15:31,382 --> 00:15:34,382
Yip, yip, yip, yippity yip yip.
Yip, yip, yip, yippity yip yip.

357
00:15:34,382 --> 00:15:37,382
- Okay, the hardest part
about driving the rocket van

358
00:15:37,382 --> 00:15:38,382
is taking off.

359
00:15:38,382 --> 00:15:40,382
- Don't worry, bap.

360
00:15:40,382 --> 00:15:42,382
I've seen you do it
a million times.

361
00:15:42,382 --> 00:15:45,382
You just turn the ignition
and hit the gas and--

362
00:15:48,382 --> 00:15:49,382
[crash]

363
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:50,382
[Engine revs]
[Thud]

364
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:52,382
[Crash, thud]

[Crash]

368
00:16:01,382 --> 00:16:04,382
- Buhdeuce,
I would just like to say...

369
00:16:04,382 --> 00:16:08,382
That was the best take-off
I've seen in my entire life.

370
00:16:08,382 --> 00:16:11,382
- Thanks, bap.
I learned it from watching you.

371
00:16:11,382 --> 00:16:12,382
- Aw, shucks, my duck.

372
00:16:12,382 --> 00:16:14,382
Oh, by the way, you're headed
right for the water.

373
00:16:16,382 --> 00:16:17,382
[Both screaming]

374
00:16:20,382 --> 00:16:22,382
- [Chuckles]
Lily pads.

375
00:16:22,382 --> 00:16:24,382
More like tasty pads.

376
00:16:24,382 --> 00:16:26,382
[Chomping]

377
00:16:26,382 --> 00:16:27,382
- Stop shoving food
in my body

378
00:16:27,382 --> 00:16:29,382
and show me how to get
to tree city.

379
00:16:29,382 --> 00:16:30,382
- [Belches]

380
00:16:30,382 --> 00:16:32,382
- You da navigator now.

381
00:16:32,382 --> 00:16:35,382
- Hang on. All right.

382
00:16:35,382 --> 00:16:36,382
Let's see here.

383
00:16:36,382 --> 00:16:38,382
Oh, one question--

384
00:16:38,382 --> 00:16:40,382
how do we turn this thing on?

385
00:16:40,382 --> 00:16:42,382
- Wait, I think I see it!

386
00:16:42,382 --> 00:16:46,382
Hold on, bap, 'cause
I do not know what I'm doing!

387
00:16:53,382 --> 00:16:55,382
- Hoo-hoo! Nice flying, b.

388
00:16:55,382 --> 00:16:56,382
Couldn't have crash-landed
better myself.

389
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:59,382
- You know, having your body
isn't so bad.

390
00:16:59,382 --> 00:17:02,382
I can drive the rocket van,
I'm not hungry all the time,

391
00:17:02,382 --> 00:17:04,382
and I can even do this.

392
00:17:06,382 --> 00:17:07,463
[Intricate knocking rhythm]

393
00:17:09,382 --> 00:17:11,382
- T-midi!
- T-midi!

394
00:17:11,382 --> 00:17:13,382
- Sheesh-uh-roo-roo.

395
00:17:13,382 --> 00:17:16,382
Or should I say
switch-uh-roo-roo?

396
00:17:16,382 --> 00:17:18,382
- Yo, we ate switcheroo bread
and we need to switch back

397
00:17:18,382 --> 00:17:21,382
before sundown.
Can we come in? Thanks.

398
00:17:24,382 --> 00:17:26,382
So, where's
your switcheroo bread?

399
00:17:26,382 --> 00:17:29,382
'Cause I am starving!
[Rumbling]

400
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,382
Oh, yeah.
I hear you, baby.

401
00:17:31,382 --> 00:17:34,382
- Oh, no. Abso-hoot-ly not.

402
00:17:34,382 --> 00:17:36,382
That loaf is rare
and precious.

403
00:17:36,382 --> 00:17:39,382
Which is why it's in my rare
and precious bread collection.

404
00:17:39,382 --> 00:17:41,382
- But if we don't eat
that loaf,

405
00:17:41,382 --> 00:17:43,382
we'll be stuck
like this forever.

406
00:17:43,382 --> 00:17:46,382
- Do I look like I give a hoot?
- Yes?

407
00:17:46,382 --> 00:17:49,382
- No! Perhaps you could just
change your names

408
00:17:49,382 --> 00:17:51,382
to swadeuce and buhsway.

409
00:17:51,382 --> 00:17:53,382
[Laughing]

410
00:17:53,382 --> 00:17:56,382
You know, because I took
sway from swaysway and the--

411
00:17:56,382 --> 00:17:59,382
- we get it. We get it.
[Rumbling]

412
00:17:59,382 --> 00:18:01,382
Does anyone know
if this is edible?

413
00:18:01,382 --> 00:18:03,382
- Look, bap, maybe
this was meant to be

414
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:06,382
and we should just be happy
with our new bodies.

415
00:18:06,382 --> 00:18:09,382
- What? No way.
Breadwinners never give up.

416
00:18:09,382 --> 00:18:11,382
[Rumbling]
What about just the shade?

417
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:12,382
- Don't eat that.

418
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:15,382
- Then I want my body back.

419
00:18:15,382 --> 00:18:16,382
- Why?

420
00:18:16,382 --> 00:18:18,382
My body isn't good enough
for you?

421
00:18:18,382 --> 00:18:19,382
- It's not that.

422
00:18:19,382 --> 00:18:22,382
I just cannot deal
with your appetite anymore.

423
00:18:22,382 --> 00:18:25,382
I am <i>so hungry!</i>

424
00:18:25,382 --> 00:18:28,382
I am this close
to going zombie on someone.

425
00:18:28,382 --> 00:18:30,382
This close.

426
00:18:30,382 --> 00:18:32,382
- Tough.
I'm keeping your body.

427
00:18:32,382 --> 00:18:34,382
One day, you'll get used
to my body

428
00:18:34,382 --> 00:18:36,382
and learn
to not totally hate it.

429
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:38,382
- Oh, I don't hate your body.

430
00:18:38,382 --> 00:18:41,382
In fact, I think your body
is perfect.

431
00:18:41,382 --> 00:18:42,382
- You do?

432
00:18:42,382 --> 00:18:46,382
- Yeah, for this.

- Cuckoo-roo-roo.

435
00:18:50,382 --> 00:18:53,382

with my own Booty.

Huh.
[Chomps]

- Ooh.
Ow...

00:19:17,382 --> 00:19:21,134
Please, take your
rough-housing

445
00:19:21,134 --> 00:19:22,382
out of my house.

- Hey, that's my line!

00:19:32,382 --> 00:19:35,382
First you take my body,
now you take my lines?

00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:38,382
- Oh, I'll take your lines
and I'll take your moves, too!

comes out of your chest?

- Oh, you mean
the six-pack punch?

00:19:50,382 --> 00:19:51,382
- Yeah, yeah, that.

460
00:19:51,382 --> 00:19:53,382
- Well, first, you got
to rip your shirt off.

461

- Yeah ha ha!

462
00:19:54,382 --> 00:19:56,382
- Now lean back and flex
your pecs and abs

00:19:56,382 --> 00:19:58,382
at the same time.

464

00:19:59,382 --> 00:20:02,382
- Yeah. Sometimes it helps
if you shout hoo-ahh!

00:20:02,382 --> 00:20:03,382
- Hoo-ahh!

467
00:20:03,382 --> 00:20:05,382
- Ooh!
Oh ho ho!

468
00:20:05,382 --> 00:20:07,382
Nice job, bap.

469
00:20:07,382 --> 00:20:11,382
- So, uh, how do you put it
back in?

- [Grunts]

471
00:20:13,382 --> 00:20:16,382
- Ow. Ow, my melon.

take the switcheroo bread.

Just please
stop destroying my--

Dude, the sun is setting.
If we don't eat this loaf

477

right now,
we'll be stuck this way forever.

wasn't worth

so totally cool

how you saved the loaf
like that.

without your righteous bod,

which I get to keep forever

494

because apparently
you don't want it.

a lot of great times together.

Okay, I changed my mind.
I want my body back.
