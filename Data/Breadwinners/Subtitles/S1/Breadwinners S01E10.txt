00:16:36,424 --> 00:16:38,424
- Aw, bubble nuggets.

362
00:16:49,424 --> 00:16:52,424
- Buhdeuce, I just want
to say that...

363
00:16:52,424 --> 00:16:55,424
Without you today...

364
00:16:55,424 --> 00:16:57,424
Was the best day ever!

365
00:16:57,424 --> 00:16:58,424
- Oh, yeah?
Same here.

366
00:16:58,424 --> 00:17:00,424
My customers wept
tears of joy

367
00:17:00,424 --> 00:17:02,424
when I delivered
their bread.

368
00:17:02,424 --> 00:17:03,424
- My customers said,

369
00:17:04,424 --> 00:17:05,424
"the bread tastes
so much better

370
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:09,424
without buhdeuce's stinkiness
ruining the flavor!

371
00:17:09,424 --> 00:17:12,424
- Jenny quackles kissed me.

372
00:17:12,424 --> 00:17:13,424
On the beak.

373
00:17:13,424 --> 00:17:15,424
- [Gasps]

374
00:17:15,424 --> 00:17:16,424
Yeah, well,

00:17:16,424 --> 00:17:18,424
how's living in a frog house?

376
00:17:18,424 --> 00:17:19,424
- Quazy good.

377
00:17:19,424 --> 00:17:20,424
Especially after I made

378
00:17:20,424 --> 00:17:22,424
a few homey modifications.

379
00:17:25,424 --> 00:17:28,424
- Well, I guess
you're happy, then.

380
00:17:28,424 --> 00:17:29,424
- I am.

Riduckulously happy.

No.

I'm riduckulously sad.

384
00:17:36,424 --> 00:17:38,424
I need my best bap.

march over there and--

386
00:17:44,424 --> 00:17:45,424
buhdeuce?

387
00:17:45,424 --> 00:17:47,424
What are you doing here?

388
00:17:47,424 --> 00:17:48,424
- Oh, hey, swaysway.

00:17:48,424 --> 00:17:49,424
I was just coming
to, um...

Find my lucky right sock?

391
00:17:53,424 --> 00:17:54,424
What are you doing?

392
00:17:54,424 --> 00:17:55,424
- Me?

393
00:17:55,424 --> 00:17:57,424
Oh, I was just, uh...

394
00:17:57,424 --> 00:17:59,424
Making sure there's

Yep.

- Look, swaysway,

398
00:18:03,424 --> 00:18:05,424
the real reason I came
was to say--

00:18:05,424 --> 00:18:06,424
[phone ringing]

400
00:18:06,424 --> 00:18:07,424
It's an order!

Hyah!

402
00:18:13,424 --> 00:18:16,424
- Breadwinners, delivering bread
up in your beak.

403
00:18:16,424 --> 00:18:18,424
So leave a message
at the beep.

[Duck quacking]

405
00:18:19,424 --> 00:18:20,424

[Duck quacking]

407
00:18:22,424 --> 00:18:24,424
He's having a big shindig

[Duck quacking]

409
00:18:26,424 --> 00:18:28,424
And he needs 100 loaves

410
00:18:28,424 --> 00:18:30,424
To the rocket van!

411

I'm gonna crush buhdeuce!

418
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:46,424
I've got the bread,

I've got the speed,

420
00:18:47,424 --> 00:18:49,424

421
00:18:49,424 --> 00:18:52,424
No idea where I'm going.

[Farts sputtering]

423
00:18:55,424 --> 00:18:57,424
- Oh, at this rate,

424
00:18:57,424 --> 00:18:59,424
I won't get
to the mayor's vacation home

425
00:18:59,424 --> 00:19:00,424
until next year.

426
00:19:00,424 --> 00:19:02,424
Better step on my gas.

00:19:11,424 --> 00:19:12,424
then I am...

430
00:19:12,424 --> 00:19:13,424
Lost.

431
00:19:14,424 --> 00:19:15,424
Man, navigating is much harder

432
00:19:15,424 --> 00:19:17,424
than just flying
the rocket van.

433
00:19:17,424 --> 00:19:19,424
Flying the rocket van?

434
00:19:21,424 --> 00:19:23,424

because buhdeuce
is a feather brain.

You wrecked the rocket van.

- Yeah, well, you wrecked
my feather fluffer.

- Are you guys seriously
still fighting?

452

I'm not rescuing you
until you end this quazy feud

453
00:20:11,424 --> 00:20:12,424
and make up.

We'll just get sucked
into the boiling hot lava.

doesn't even compare

to how much I missed you!
