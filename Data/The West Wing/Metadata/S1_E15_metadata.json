Meanwhile, he's intermittently on the phone with Toby and Sam, who have flown to Connecticut and are now lost in a rental car on the Connecticut Turnpike. They've gone on critical business: the president's nominee for the Supreme Court, Roberto Mendoza, was pulled over by the local police for \"driving while Hispanic\" and refused to take a drunk test, so he was incarcerated. Toby has to talk the judge down from making a big public issue of his arrest by fighting the charges in court.\u2014meebly"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0745602", "rating": 8.9, "votes": 1563, "number_of_episodes": 155}
