With no clear nominee going into the convention, the Democratic party risks appearing unsure about both Santos and Russell - a position that President Bartlet does not want the Republicans to be able to exploit.\u2014Murray Chapman"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0745636", "rating": 8.2, "votes": 715, "number_of_episodes": 155}
