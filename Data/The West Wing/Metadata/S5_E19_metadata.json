At the 11th hour, however, the CEO of an IBM-like company tells Josh that the first effect of the new agreement, of which his company is a huge beneficiary, will be the immediate transfer of 17,000 programming jobs to India; the head of the communications workers' union, which is representing the affected programmers, brings two of the programmers to Josh's office, and they refuse to leave, which leaves Josh to question the underlying adverse effects of the trade deal. Throughout the episode, Ryan tries to make Josh care that he's completing his internship that day. Donna, meanwhile, pesters Josh to bring her on the Brussels trip in an effort to make her a more active player in West Wing activities, eventually leading to a trade-off that will mean even bigger things for Donna in the long run.\u2014meebly"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0745684", "rating": 7.5, "votes": 709, "number_of_episodes": 155}
