1
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:10,572
<i>The NBA title up for grabs</i>

2
00:00:10,635 --> 00:00:12,355
<i>beginning Wednesday night
in Salt Lake City.</i>

3
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:13,471
Utah Jazz!

4
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:16,766
<i>Part two between the defending
champs and the Mailman's crew.</i>

5
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:19,352
<i>Super Mike and the gang looking human,</i>

6
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:23,106
<i>working on just two days' rest
in the thin air of Salt Lake City.</i>

7
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,068
After they lost
the year before...

8
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:30,155
Utah came back better the next year.

9
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:39,289
The atmosphere in Utah was, "This is it.
We can finally vanquish them."

10
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:41,708
Utah was waiting for us.

11
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:45,545
We basically had to fly
to Salt Lake the next day.

12
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:49,424
It seemed like, uh,
we were running on fumes.

13
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:55,805
Most people struggle
to be present.

14
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,810
People go and sit in ashrams for 20 years
in India trying to be present.

15
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:05,899
Do yoga, meditate,
trying to get here, now.

16
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,030
What you listening to?

17
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:15,325
- What are you listening to?
- Huh?

18
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:16,688
What are you listening to?

19
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:20,663
Kenny Lattimore.
It's brand new, not even out yet.

20
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:23,708
He's a friend of mine,
you know I can get that.

21
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:31,299
<i>Most people live in fear because
we project the past into the future.</i>

22
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:35,553
<i>Michael's a mystic.
He was never anywhere else.</i>

23
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,263
Hey.

24
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,850
I sense you know
you're gonna win this first game.

25
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:42,870
- I sense that.
- What'd you say?

26
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:45,438
Whatever it is, it's "Yes. No. Maybe."

27
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:50,401
Coming into the final series,
what's your mental preparation like?

28
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:53,196
Yes. No. Maybe. Whatever that was.

29
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:58,576
<i>His gift was not that he could
jump high, run fast, shoot a basketball.</i>

30
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,330
- Can I walk in peace?
- Go ahead.

31
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:03,414
I love you guys.

32
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:08,002
<i>His gift was that
he was completely present.</i>

33
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,462
<i>And that was the separator.</i>

34
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:13,091
Go ahead!

35
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:30,650
I got up, I stretched...

36
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:32,944
had a couple beers...

37
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:35,864
played the piano...

38
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:36,947
one cigar.

39
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:39,284
In the lobby bar?

40
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,411
No, in my room.

41
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:44,998
I've got a piano in my room, man.
I was in there...

42
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,916
It's called the Jordan Bar.

43
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:50,003
You see that go in?
Don't look at my fuckin' feet.

44
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,505
Look at where the ball is going.

45
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,342
MJ, you got four?

46
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:57,552
KB's got none.

47
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:59,596
Come on, Keith.
Get on the board, baby.

48
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,139
Get on the board.

49
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:05,727
Get on the board.
Go down and rebound that.

50
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,104
<i>The big downfall
of a lot of players</i>

51
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:11,149
<i>who are otherwise gifted
is thinking about failure.</i>

52
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,987
- Goddamn it!
- Midair right there. That's like...

53
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:22,202
<i>Michael didn't allow what he
couldn't control to get inside his head.</i>

54
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:27,248
<i>He would say, "Why would I think about
missing a shot I haven't taken yet?"</i>

55
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,332
Garbage.

56
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,257
Goddamn!

57
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,636
Damn! Put 'em away, MJ.

58
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:47,018
Ooh, I just love it!

59
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:48,894
Whoo!

60
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,233
<i>A spectacular move!</i>

61
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:54,901
<i>The game's over!</i>

62
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:57,320
<i>Chicago Stadium is going wild!</i>

63
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,467
<i>First of all,
there's no backstabbing going on here.</i>

64
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,801
<i>It's time for me to move on.</i>

65
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:05,385
<i>This will be Phil's last year
as the coach of the Bulls.</i>

66
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,875
- <i>Are the expectations too high?
- Where do we go from here?</i>

67
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,919
<i>The only question: how long can it last?</i>

68
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:27,141
<i>This year's Finals
has a familiar feel.</i>

69
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:30,561
<i>Same time, same teams,
same places, same high stakes.</i>

70
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:33,398
<i>But Utah is hoping
for a different end result this year.</i>

71
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:36,752
Remember what we said
about your breathing,

72
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,570
and your centering,
and getting yourself focused to the court.

73
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:43,032
You guys know that you gotta support
yourselves and your teammates.

74
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:46,286
Here in this building,
it's like sheep to the wolves.

75
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,544
In '98,
were you guys in Utah?

76
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,773
- No, my mom didn't let us go.
- We were downstairs in the basement.

77
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,882
- Exactly.
- Watching the game. We had school.

78
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:03,511
She felt like Utah
was a little hostile for us as young kids.

79
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:12,186
I don't remember much of the games,
and seeing him play.

80
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,982
But I remember the fans
and it was so loud.

81
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:19,944
I mean, the screaming was just nonstop.

82
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,279
It was brutal.

83
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:23,740
We didn't like the Jazz at all.

84
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:27,118
As a family, we would get down there
and just talk so much trash.

85
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,120
Those games would get crazy.

86
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,791
<i>This Utah team is vastly
improved from last year's finalists.</i>

87
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,377
<i>Better skills and much more confident.</i>

88
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,742
<i>The Bulls have beaten
every team this season,</i>

89
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:40,840
<i>except for the Utah Jazz.</i>

90
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:46,763
Let's get ready to rumble!

91
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:49,474
<i>Pippen working on Russell.</i>

92
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,976
<i>Double team,
Stockton comes over and steals.</i>

93
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,229
<i>Stockton waltzes in
off the left side of the lane.</i>

94
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,358
I never said, "Oh, my goodness,
this is the Bulls."

95
00:05:58,441 --> 00:05:59,484
Great team,

96
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:02,570
all the respect that they deserved,
they'd get from me.

97
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:06,866
But I sure didn't feel an aura
about Michael Jordan or the Bulls.

98
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:10,912
I don't know how you would play against
somebody with that. We were there to win.

99
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:12,789
<i>Kukoc has it picked off
by Russell,</i>

100
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,832
<i>handed to Stockton, now Malone!</i>

101
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:20,129
<i>Twenty-second timeout, Chicago!</i>

102
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:26,719
Guys, this is a scary fucking situation.
This game should be dead fucking meat.

103
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,639
Now, goddamn it,
get yourselves serious on this.

104
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:32,058
Come on, think positive, man.
Let's go.

105
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,894
<i>It's Scottie back to Michael.
Russell's on him.</i>

106
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:38,564
<i>Around the Longley screen.
Michael... dishes to Longley.</i>

107
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,983
<i>Up with the shot... to tie the game!</i>

108
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:44,529
<i>And it's overtime in game one.</i>

109
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:47,990
Come on now, let's go.

110
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,120
<i>Twenty-one for Malone!
Hooked away by Hornacek!</i>

111
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:53,538
<i>Trying to stop him.</i>

112
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:56,124
<i>He's chased by Jordan,
but makes it in anyway!</i>

113
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:06,926
<i>And game one goes to Utah in overtime.</i>

114
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,390
Knowing that this
is the last dance,

115
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:15,143
I'm trying to muster up
the energy to finish this off.

116
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,979
We were mentally, physically exhausted,

117
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:21,357
but we didn't lose focus
on what we were trying to achieve.

118
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:25,486
<i>Hornacek on Michael, fadeaway...</i>

119
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:26,945
<i>Got it!</i>

120
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,450
<i>Pippen slices through the defense
and slams it.</i>

121
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,786
<i>Kukoc... hits off the baseline.</i>

122
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:38,082
<i>Michael, with the shot clock winding down,
against Hornacek.</i>

123
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,793
<i>Michael's gonna do it.
Two defenders, a whistle...</i>

124
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:44,046
<i>Count the basket, plus the foul.</i>

125
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:49,677
<i>Chicago comes into Salt Lake City,
weary or not, and gets out with a split.</i>

126
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,345
Three more, three more.

127
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,349
They swept LA.

128
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:58,811
You know how much it takes to guard Shaq
and try to push that motherfucker around?

129
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,771
That ain't the point. I ain't Shaq.

130
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,607
- Huh?
- I ain't Shaq.

131
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:05,568
Like I said, I ain't Shaq.

132
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,906
The Jazz won game one
in overtime at home.

133
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,991
The Bulls won a close game to even it.

134
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,784
It was a hard-fought series...

135
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:16,287
except for game three in Chicago.

136
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,122
<i>♪ Right here! Right now! ♪</i>

137
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,666
<i>♪ Right here! Right now!
Right here! ♪</i>

138
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,377
Gentlemen, game three!
Have a great game.

139
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:24,461
Careful.

140
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,966
<i>Here's Scottie, into the lane,
another runner.</i>

141
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,260
<i>He hits it, plus he's coming to the line.</i>

142
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,096
<i>Eisley has it blocked by Harper.</i>

143
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,183
<i>Karl on the run, a hook. It's an airball.</i>

144
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:42,396
<i>Michael spins on Hornacek
to the left hand. An absolute beauty.</i>

145
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:02,917
<i>Somehow, someway... he scores.</i>

146
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:09,173
The Utah Jazz of Malone and Stockton,

147
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:12,343
the Jazz who managed to get to the Finals
two years in a row,

148
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:14,512
were held to 54 points.

149
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:19,559
The lowest point total since the advent
of the shot clock in any game,

150
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,018
not just a playoff game.

151
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:22,811
Ridiculous.

152
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:25,439
Now Bill's the only one who ain't scored.

153
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:28,526
<i>Wennington,
the only Bull who hasn't scored.</i>

154
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:29,777
<i>So let him do it.</i>

155
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,281
<i>Well, the evening is complete!</i>

156
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:38,661
<i>A total humiliation for the Utah Jazz.</i>

157
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,246
<i>Beaten by 42.</i>

158
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:47,003
<i>Chicago leads the series two games to one,
but somehow it seems like more than that.</i>

159
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,673
- Coach...
- This is actually the score?

160
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,261
- Is this the final?
- That's the final.

161
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:09,817
In sports, Dennis Rodman
is in more hot water this morning.

162
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,569
<i>The talk at practice Monday</i>

163
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:14,614
<i>wasn't just about what the Jazz
was missing in game three,</i>

164
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:17,366
<i>but who the Bulls were missing
the day after.</i>

165
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,203
<i>Dennis Rodman, once again,
was nowhere to be found.</i>

166
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,599
Is it true that Dennis
wasn't at practice today?

167
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,559
- That's true.
- Is that an excused absence?

168
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,002
- No, it's not.
- What transpired?

169
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,087
I don't know. He's not here.

170
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:37,470
I got the world heavyweight title,
and with Rodzilla in the house,

171
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:42,975
there will be no stopping
nWo Hollywood now!

172
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,686
So, Dennis Rodman
ran off after game three.

173
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,022
He took a detour, um,

174
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:50,191
from playing with the Bulls

175
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,902
to become a wrestler with Hulk Hogan.

176
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:57,990
And by the way, big dog,
I just love the way

177
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:01,285
you threw Malone around like a dishrag.

178
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:04,121
You just be the bomb, brah.

179
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,791
I wasn't trying anything.

180
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:10,211
I was just trying to play basketball,
party... fuck all the girls.

181
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:13,464
And so that just happened to be me,
Dennis shit, you know.

182
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:17,051
There are some things
worth missing practice for, brother.

183
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:22,682
He has a chartered plane ready and waiting
to whisk him off to some wrestling deal

184
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:26,102
where the scripted action called for him
to hit a guy with a chair.

185
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,814
<i>Oh, my goodness!
That was Rodman!</i>

186
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:34,026
Dennis' sideshow,
is it a reality check for the Bulls?

187
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,321
I think they're all very disturbed,
the coaches and the players.

188
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,949
<i>He'll be fined
for this latest offense.</i>

189
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,576
Rodman faces punishment by the Bulls
for missing practice.

190
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,563
Dickey, you weren't here
at the start were you?

191
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:54,587
No.

192
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,300
We beat up Dennis with some boffers.
You got to miss out on that shit.

193
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:03,597
Because he brought fame
and disreputation on all of us.

194
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:05,474
We were dishonored.

195
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,643
That's a good piece of money,
though.

196
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,095
All right, let's go.

197
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:15,025
Come on, Rodzilla! Rodzilla!

198
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:20,281
The bad-boy reputation that, frankly,
Dennis carefully cultivated

199
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,616
overshadowed his contributions
as a player.

200
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:27,204
But Phil knew
that he was a singular defensive player

201
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:32,418
who contributed mightily
to the success of that team.

202
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:36,005
Does it bother you that he's
taking away the focus from the Finals?

203
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:39,258
No, he's only taking your focus
away from the Finals, not ours.

204
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:44,388
I just think that Phil realized
that I need to always do me,

205
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:45,723
just go do what I do.

206
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:48,726
You know, like the playoff game,
I went to go wrestle.

207
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:51,937
If I did this, I go over here,
if I do that, I got to go do this.

208
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,064
They're gonna get 100%
when I'm on the court.

209
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,007
If they see him, they'll think
he'll go out that way.

210
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,695
If he closes the door, they just think...

211
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:00,779
Here's the problem.

212
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:03,699
You got 300 freaking media out there.

213
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:07,495
Dennis blew off practice and he got fined
and he's got nothing to say to nobody.

214
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,288
As he would say, "in his words."

215
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:12,917
So we gotta try to sneak him out
gate three and a half...

216
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:16,629
while 300 media are in the main hallway
in front of the locker room.

217
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,339
I don't know if we'll get that done.

218
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,807
<i>Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

219
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:12,852
<i>Has there been a Rodman sighting or is he
off wrestling with Hulk Hogan tonight?</i>

220
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,437
<i>Eisley, gotta get rid of it.</i>

221
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,817
<i>Rebound to Rodman.
It's a two-point game...</i>

222
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,696
<i>and it stays there as Pippen misses,
but Rodman chases it down.</i>

223
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,199
<i>Rodman is there!</i>

224
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,868
<i>Scottie for three!</i>

225
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,414
<i>Rodman's there and Anderson fouled him.</i>

226
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,417
<i>The Worm is a poor free throw shooter.</i>

227
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,671
<i>Certainly not the guy you want on the line
in this situation if you're Phil Jackson.</i>

228
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:45,050
<i>He rolls the dice, he makes 'em both!
Who needs practice?</i>

229
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,928
<i>Off the court,
his tired freak show continues,</i>

230
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:51,599
<i>but on the court,
he brings tremendous energy and heart.</i>

231
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,517
<i>And Chicago wins it by four.</i>

232
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,520
<i>They're poised to finish Utah off
on Friday night.</i>

233
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,441
What are your thoughts?

234
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:04,028
It might not only be your last game
with the Bulls, but your last game ever.

235
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:07,031
You've sat... Sitting on the fence here,

236
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:09,867
and obviously it's a thing
that the world wants to know.

237
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:13,871
Well, the world basically is gonna
have to wait and see what happens.

238
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,165
I mean, uh...

239
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:19,084
The job is not done,
so let's not celebrate yet.

240
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:32,222
Hey, try not to be dogshit tonight, dog.

241
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:34,266
For one time, come out ready to play.

242
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:37,892
Know what I mean?

243
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,275
You go out there, play hard, and we win,

244
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,402
you don't have to hear me
no more, ever again!

245
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,738
- I'm going to California with you.
- Shit!

246
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:51,283
- What time is our flight?
- Scott, after tonight...

247
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:55,120
if I ever see you again,
I'm gonna whip your ass.

248
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,917
You know I'mma whip your ass.

249
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:02,503
If it's in a bar,
I'mma start a barroom brawl.

250
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,422
Are your shoes okay?

251
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,841
I don't want you sliding all over
the damn place out there.

252
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:11,470
I'mma slide a ring on your hand tonight,
Tex. That's all you need to know.

253
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:16,266
<i>Tonight, game five
of the 1998 NBA Finals,</i>

254
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,269
<i>and a win for the Bulls
caps the repeat three-peat.</i>

255
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,606
<i>The stage is set
for a celebration.</i>

256
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:26,568
<i>When Michael smells
the finish line, he knows how to close.</i>

257
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,820
<i>If this is the last dance,</i>

258
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,114
<i>you might as well have it
on your own dance floor.</i>

259
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,160
<i>Malone's first shot is there.</i>

260
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:37,746
<i>Stockton... gives it to Malone.</i>

261
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,601
<i>I sense a little anxiety,
a little tightness here in Chicago.</i>

262
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,962
<i>May be a lack of focus
preparing for the parade and celebration,</i>

263
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:47,965
<i>you're forgetting that you gotta come out
and play a game.</i>

264
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:52,428
<i>Malone... 39 points!</i>

265
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:56,015
<i>Personally pushing back for Utah.</i>

266
00:16:57,141 --> 00:17:01,270
<i>10.4 seconds remaining.
Kukoc will play it in. Pippen...</i>

267
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,105
<i>Out to Kukoc for three,</i>

268
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:04,940
<i>he hits it!</i>

269
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,317
<i>Five seconds, it's a one-point game.</i>

270
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:16,827
<i>A two-point Utah lead.
Timeout Chicago. Bulls ball at half court.</i>

271
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,247
<i>For the Bulls
to win this at home,</i>

272
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:24,126
<i>they're gonna have to finish with a bang,
and a giant bang.</i>

273
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,209
<i>Harper...</i>

274
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,799
<i>Into Jordan, a prayer...</i>

275
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,135
<i>And we go to Utah.</i>

276
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:38,599
<i>Rip up the headlines.
It is very much a series.</i>

277
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:43,771
I would have loved to have
won it here at home...

278
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,397
but it didn't happen.

279
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,944
Everyone thought I could make the shot
and that's the beauty of the game.

280
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,446
For 1.1 seconds,

281
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:55,407
everybody was holding their breath,
which is kinda cute.

282
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:07,044
<i>The Bulls know how to close,
but last night, the Jazz held their own.</i>

283
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,338
<i>Utah knew it was going
to Salt Lake City</i>

284
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,839
<i>after Friday night's game five.</i>

285
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,926
<i>The Jazz just didn't know
Chicago would also be along for the ride.</i>

286
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:16,637
<i>The Bulls now 5-4
in title-clinching games,</i>

287
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,890
<i>and if they hope to win it this year,
it'll have to be in Utah.</i>

288
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,771
<i>This is it.
The Jazz have forced a game six.</i>

289
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:28,065
<i>Can they stay alive and take it to seven?</i>

290
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:31,944
<i>Both games here in Salt Lake City.
The crowd is going nuts.</i>

291
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,126
The calm before the storm.

292
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,128
Not a lot of joking today, huh?

293
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:53,340
Like in those movies when you see the lion
just sitting in the shade, just staring?

294
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:56,885
Might see the kill today.

295
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,598
<i>Some injury news,
and it's not good news</i>

296
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,350
<i>for Bulls forward Scottie Pippen.</i>

297
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:06,145
<i>After a great defensive effort
in game three,</i>

298
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,188
<i>during which he drew numerous charges,</i>

299
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:12,818
<i>Pippen has been experiencing stiffness
in his back. Earlier, we spoke with...</i>

300
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,303
Everybody got their hand in?

301
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:21,368
Hands in means
"All for one, and one for all."

302
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:23,491
This is it.
Let's go out and give our best.

303
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,832
- What time is it?
- Game time!

304
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:30,586
<i>We welcome you back
to Salt Lake City for game six.</i>

305
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:34,131
<i>And should the Jazz win tonight
and force a game seven,</i>

306
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:35,549
<i>then it would be worth noting</i>

307
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:39,553
<i>that very few teams have ever won
a seventh game on the road in the Finals.</i>

308
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:43,265
<i>Utah would have a slight edge,
it would seem, in that scenario.</i>

309
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,767
<i>So, if the Bulls want to
bring the hammer down,</i>

310
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,978
<i>game six is the time to do it.</i>

311
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,409
<i>Jordan, guarded by Russell.</i>

312
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:06,205
<i>Hornacek will open on Pippen.
They'll try and post Scottie on him.</i>

313
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:09,291
<i>They go to it right away.
Stockton comes over on the double team.</i>

314
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,710
<i>Now back to Scottie,
and they couldn't recover,</i>

315
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,337
<i>and an easy two for Scottie.</i>

316
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,006
I started the game,

317
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:20,135
and the first play of the game,
I went for a dunk.

318
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,721
And it jammed my back.

319
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:26,183
I was done after that.

320
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:31,647
I'm telling MJ I can't go no more.
"Dude, I'm done."

321
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:38,028
<i>It looks like Pippen is laboring
as he moves up and down the court.</i>

322
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:41,406
<i>A back injury is one of
the most crippling of injuries.</i>

323
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,869
<i>Malone... gets his first!</i>

324
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,250
<i>Jordan for three. Got it!</i>

325
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:56,088
<i>The Bulls lead by nine,
but here's the bad news for them:</i>

326
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:59,466
<i>moments ago, Scottie Pippen,
accompanied by trainer Chip Schaefer,</i>

327
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:01,760
<i>leaves the bench
and heads for the locker room.</i>

328
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:03,720
He was in such pain.

329
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,847
Um, so disabled.

330
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,892
He had continued loss of function.

331
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:11,478
He was losing mobility
and his pain was increasing.

332
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:14,064
It was just sort of...
kind of spiraling.

333
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,987
<i>Scottie's telling
the medical staff he is not able to play.</i>

334
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:20,070
<i>That could be the end of it
for Scottie tonight.</i>

335
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,031
<i>Malone in traffic.</i>

336
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:25,826
<i>Got his own, and put it back in.</i>

337
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:27,911
<i>Malone against Wennington.</i>

338
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:30,914
<i>Off balance,
hit it, plus the foul!</i>

339
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:35,794
When Scottie left,
we were just kinda holding on.

340
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:43,635
<i>Shot clock violation.
Michael gave it up.</i>

341
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:47,889
<i>They weren't even close to hoisting a shot
before 24 seconds.</i>

342
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,099
<i>It's Malone...</i>

343
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,145
<i>And it's Utah with the lead.</i>

344
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:56,189
<i>Only moments ago, they trailed by nine.</i>

345
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:59,401
<i>This will be
a very wearing game for Jordan.</i>

346
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,820
<i>They'll try to tire him down
and wear him out.</i>

347
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:05,198
<i>It will be interesting to see if he'll
have enough at the end of the game</i>

348
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:07,284
<i>because of the minutes
he's gonna have to play.</i>

349
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:14,499
During the break,
I was in the locker room

350
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,919
trying to get some heat and steam
and stuff put on it

351
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:21,214
to try to see if I can,
you know, do something.

352
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:24,137
<i>Ahmad Rashad,
back at the Delta Center,</i>

353
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,844
<i>where the Jazz lead the Bulls by four.</i>

354
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:29,598
<i>The big story in the first half has been
the condition of Scottie Pippen's back.</i>

355
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:30,682
<i>He's really been hurting.</i>

356
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,018
<i>Scottie Pippen is back
out here on the floor.</i>

357
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:36,480
<i>Whether or not he'll be able to play,
and play effectively, we'll find out.</i>

358
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,734
Could you start? Really?

359
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:42,778
All right.

360
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:45,923
<i>Utah in possession
as we start the third quarter.</i>

361
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:47,240
<i>Malone, right to work!</i>

362
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:53,455
<i>Rodman battling like crazy,
but can't quite hold onto it.</i>

363
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:56,708
<i>And Rodman trips Malone up.
They've got to call a flagrant here.</i>

364
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:58,377
<i>They've got to call a flagrant.</i>

365
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:05,217
<i>I love what I'm seeing,
the battle between these two guys.</i>

366
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,719
<i>They're fighting,
giving it everything they got.</i>

367
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:15,143
<i>Rodman... drills a 20-footer,
and gives it that "go figure" gesture.</i>

368
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:18,063
<i>This is Scottie out high,
immediately returns it to Harper.</i>

369
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:19,689
<i>A little jump hook. It's good.</i>

370
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:24,194
<i>Is Pippen anything more than a decoy now
on offense for Chicago?</i>

371
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:27,697
I was a decoy that whole game,
but they didn't know it.

372
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:32,411
Michael said, "You just stay out here,
do what you can do.

373
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,664
You better being out here
than in the locker room."

374
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:38,500
So I gutted myself through that game.

375
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,087
<i>Pippen, giving it his best.</i>

376
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,880
<i>And that time, it was good enough.</i>

377
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,925
Pippen is barely
getting up and down the floor.

378
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,219
So, I'm taking all the shots,

379
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:54,057
I'm bringing all the energy,
and I got very little left in the tank.

380
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:57,853
<i>As we start the fourth quarter,
Jordan has scored 29 points.</i>

381
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:01,523
<i>He's played 34 of the 36 minutes so far...</i>

382
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,484
<i>after playing 45 on Friday night.</i>

383
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:08,113
<i>You have to believe fatigue
is an important factor now.</i>

384
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:11,533
<i>Out to MJ for three! It's short.</i>

385
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,827
<i>Michael... Short.</i>

386
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:17,539
<i>The jumpers come up short
when fatigue is a factor.</i>

387
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,292
<i>There's Pippen heading back
to the locker room again</i>

388
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,836
<i>to try to stretch out that ailing back.</i>

389
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,691
We had a massage therapist
working with him

390
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:29,342
and using medication
and doing everything we could...

391
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:32,345
to try to relieve his pain
and his symptoms.

392
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:36,725
Treat him for five minutes so he can get
pain relief and play for five minutes.

393
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:38,916
<i>They had him in the back,</i>

394
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:42,063
<i>they were putting ice on his back and
electrical stimulation for pain relief,</i>

395
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:45,317
<i>and they were trying to bide their time
up until the ten-minute mark</i>

396
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,737
<i>to bring him back out and see if he
can play the last ten minutes of the game.</i>

397
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:52,365
<i>As you can see, he's back on the floor.
We just have to see how it goes.</i>

398
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:57,412
Anybody that'd have a notion
that Pippen was a soft player

399
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,164
is patently absurd.

400
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:03,001
He's as tough a player and as intense
a competitor as anybody I've worked with.

401
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:05,712
What he did in game six was extraordinary.

402
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,548
I know so many players
that would've tapped out

403
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,258
without hesitation in that situation.

404
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:15,347
And he was gonna just throw it out there
and finish it no matter what.

405
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,768
<i>Malone, three defenders on him
and they take it away.</i>

406
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:23,396
<i>It's Pippen wincing as he
comes up with the loose ball.</i>

407
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,732
<i>Scottie just hobbling around.</i>

408
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,693
<i>Jordan with the jumper.</i>

409
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:31,655
<i>And with 37 points</i>

410
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:36,284
<i>as Utah falls behind now for
the first time since the second quarter.</i>

411
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:39,496
<i>Stockton has a little daylight...</i>

412
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,831
<i>and Utah has a three-point lead.</i>

413
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,127
<i>Pippen in the lane,</i>

414
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:49,965
<i>connects on the turnaround.
Playing through clenched teeth.</i>

415
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,552
Game six is going back and forth
and back and forth...

416
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,846
and I just didn't see any way
this wasn't going seven.

417
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:00,600
Utah was really mentally tough.

418
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:02,685
<i>Fifty seconds.</i>

419
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:05,521
<i>Malone...</i>

420
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:10,485
<i>Crosscourt Stockton, a three...</i>

421
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:11,569
<i>It's there!</i>

422
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:21,454
There was less than a minute to play.
We're down three.

423
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,498
Phil calls timeout.

424
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:27,377
<i>This is a big 20-second
timeout for Chicago</i>

425
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:30,046
<i>because it allows Jordan to get some rest.</i>

426
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:33,425
Michael Jordan,
at this advanced stage of his career,

427
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:35,385
has to carry the team.

428
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:38,972
He has to play extra minutes
in a grueling series.

429
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:43,560
And that last sequence
in the final half-minute-plus...

430
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:48,648
is one of the greatest sequences
you'll ever see in any sport.

431
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:51,860
<i>The Bulls want a
two-for-one possession here.</i>

432
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:54,321
<i>Try to get a quick score
and get to the free-throw line</i>

433
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:56,364
<i>to give them two opportunities for one.</i>

434
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,367
<i>Pippen into Jordan.</i>

435
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:02,996
<i>Michael working on Russell.</i>

436
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,498
<i>Brings them to within one.</i>

437
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:10,420
Michael takes it right to the rim
and lays it in, so now we need to stop.

438
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:13,548
When I made the layup
and it went back down,

439
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:16,801
I knew they were gonna run
that patented play through Karl Malone.

440
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:19,554
They ran that play a couple times prior.

441
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:23,683
And Dennis and Malone
had been fighting all game.

442
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:26,311
And Karl totally forgot
that I was on the weak side.

443
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:31,566
<i>Malone is doubled.
They swat at it and steal it.</i>

444
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:36,863
<i>Michael never clears,
so Malone doesn't see him.</i>

445
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:39,199
<i>He comes from the blind side
and strips him.</i>

446
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:42,452
Now I got the ball,
and I can see Phil,

447
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:44,454
basically out of the corner of my eye.

448
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:46,122
He wasn't gonna call a timeout.

449
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:50,168
If we could do something
without them talking about it,

450
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:52,212
working against a set defense,

451
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:54,673
we'd rather go with a live ball situation.

452
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:59,302
<i>Seventeen seconds from game seven
or from championship number six.</i>

453
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:02,806
What are you thinking
as you're coming back up the floor?

454
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:05,266
"Get the hell out the way."

455
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:08,895
"Get the hell out the way,"
only thing I was thinking.

456
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,316
I ain't had to do shit. All I did was
plant myself right down there.

457
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,902
I knew it, I said,
"He's gonna shoot this fucker."

458
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:17,946
He is not gonna pass this fucking ball.

459
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:22,158
I don't give a fuck if it's John Paxson
or fucking Steve Kerr.

460
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,868
Hell no, this is his turn.

461
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,663
<i>When I scoped over the floor,</i>

462
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:30,083
<i>I felt like I can get a jump shot off
or I can get all the way to the basket.</i>

463
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:33,837
<i>So it's just a matter of me
picking the right time when to attack.</i>

464
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,590
<i>Jordan, open...</i>

465
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:39,217
<i>Chicago with the lead!</i>

466
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:44,639
<i>Timeout Utah.</i>

467
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:47,517
<i>5.2 seconds left.</i>

468
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:53,064
<i>Michael Jordan running on fumes
with 45 points.</i>

469
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:57,610
<i>At the end of the game,
you gotta get it out of his hands.</i>

470
00:28:57,694 --> 00:28:58,987
<i>He's a killer.</i>

471
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,411
<i>Watch Jordan's left hand here
as he gives Russell the push.</i>

472
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:08,246
<i>Referee can't see that.</i>

473
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:11,750
<i>Jordan frees himself up for a clean look.</i>

474
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,754
Everybody say I pushed off him.

475
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:19,591
Bullshit. His energy was going that way.
I didn't have to push him that way.

476
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:22,260
Russell was already stumbling away.

477
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:25,138
That hand on his backside

478
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:28,475
was the equivalent of a maître d'
showing someone to their table.

479
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:32,854
<i>When he took that shot,</i>

480
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:36,149
<i>you could just hear the energy
get sucked right out of the building.</i>

481
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:44,908
<i>That may have been the last shot
Michael Jordan will ever take in the NBA.</i>

482
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:52,624
<i>If that's the last image
of Michael Jordan, how magnificent is it?</i>

483
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,336
And those devastated fans...

484
00:29:57,003 --> 00:30:02,342
were just groaning this collective groan
as the Jazz take timeout.

485
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:11,142
I'm tired as hell. I'm exhausted.

486
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:13,144
<i>But I have one more stop.</i>

487
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,396
One more stop, big man,
one more stop.

488
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,235
Here we go, baby.
Come on, baby, one more stop.

489
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:25,365
I can't do nothing else.
Just go to the basket.

490
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:28,535
You got to be ready to run a charge.
Don't give 'em another T.

491
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:50,640
I'm collecting my thoughts,
but I'm tired.

492
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,434
I'm trying to muster up the energy...

493
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:56,354
to finish this off.

494
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:59,899
<i>If they score,
there's a game seven.</i>

495
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:03,319
<i>If they don't,
for the second straight year,</i>

496
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:05,113
<i>they go out on six.</i>

497
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,699
<i>Stockton, Harper's on him.</i>

498
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:10,326
<i>Behind the screen.
Harper got a piece of it.</i>

499
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,661
<i>It comes off!</i>

500
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:17,208
<i>The Chicago Bulls...</i>

501
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:21,921
<i>have won their sixth NBA championship,</i>

502
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:24,424
<i>and it's their second three-peat.</i>

503
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:33,850
Oh, my God! That was beautiful!

504
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:36,227
- What a finish!
- I had faith!

505
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,897
I'll bet you did. God bless you.

506
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:52,410
The Chicago Bulls, the 1998 NBA Champion,

507
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:55,121
and a team for the ages.

508
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:58,958
- Can you believe it?
- Yeah, I can.

509
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:00,042
I can't believe it.

510
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:02,128
- I believed in it.
- That was beautiful.

511
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:04,714
I never gave up. I never gave up.

512
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:08,134
Every time we were close,
I knew we were gonna do it. I knew it.

513
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:12,972
1998 NBA Finals MVP, Michael Jordan.

514
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:39,958
He's a hero. He's the guy
that delivered every time he was asked

515
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:41,751
during these types of situations.

516
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:45,463
Man, can you believe it? Six.

517
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,007
- Six!
- Six.

518
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:51,219
Six of 'em! Six of 'em!

519
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:55,056
Yes, sir! Six of them!

520
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:58,935
Now, y'all say whatever you want,
they can't win till we quit.

521
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:12,073
Check that out. Man, look at that.

522
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:14,909
That's waterproof color right there,
that's waterproof.

523
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:19,414
- What was you watching this afternoon?
- I was watching <i>Man with the Iron Face.</i>

524
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:21,666
- Iron Mask.
- Iron Mask.

525
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:23,584
And he's here!

526
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:26,004
You know what I told the guys
when we stuck our hands in?

527
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,630
- What?
- All for one and one for all.

528
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:29,507
I did. I'm not kidding.

529
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,735
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. I'm glad you came.

530
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:34,637
You did some beautiful stuff
just now, man. That was poetic.

531
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:35,972
Thank you. Thank you very much.

532
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:38,099
Can you continue this,
with this championship?

533
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,977
I'm not even gonna think about this.
All I'm gonna think about is

534
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,980
tonight have fun, tomorrow morning,
we'll worry about everything else.

535
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:46,315
Scottie, now that you're celebrating,
feeling good,

536
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,234
you're coming back next year, right?

537
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:52,113
I'll answer that in a couple days.
Maybe at Grant Park.

538
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:56,075
Greatest team to ever play this game.

539
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,369
You just gotta respect it.
If they don't respect that?

540
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:02,040
There's a lot of people
doing a lot of illegal drugs.

541
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,841
- Thanks, man.
- That's what it is. That's it.

542
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:07,920
Can you imagine? It's still daylight.

543
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:10,548
We might be able
to get some golf swings in.

544
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:19,974
This is great. This was the greatest.

545
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,310
Dennis, good job.

546
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:25,063
Fellas. Great job.

547
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:28,691
Thank you, man. Take care, man.
Tell the wife I say hello, okay?

548
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:30,276
See you guys. Excuse me.

549
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:49,128
Upon arrival at the hotel...

550
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:54,717
we just had cameras in front of us
and people waiting for autographs.

551
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:57,762
That was so amazing, you know,
just being with the group...

552
00:34:57,845 --> 00:35:01,099
- Jordan! Jordan! Jordan!
- ...and feeling that rush of adrenaline...

553
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:05,061
because of people's adoration
for Michael, mainly.

554
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:29,167
Goddamn!

555
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:31,345
I'm sorry,
is this the smoking floor?

556
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,019
- Yes, it is.
- It is now.

557
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:39,345
<i>♪ We are the champions ♪</i>

558
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:41,263
<i>♪ My friend! ♪</i>

559
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:43,808
- Kiss it.
- Kiss the trophy?

560
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:45,518
- Yeah.
- Oh, man!

561
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:53,901
Yeah! Damn right!

562
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:58,156
Phil said, "Can you play 48 minutes?"
I said, "Whatever it takes."

563
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:00,950
It didn't help much
when Scottie went down.

564
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:03,995
I wasn't expecting him to go down.
That scared the shit out of me.

565
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:06,918
How good did that
jumper feel? I see you gave the little...

566
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:08,833
Oh, I had to, everything was short!

567
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:12,295
Flicking my wrist, everything was short.
I had a great...

568
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,214
- That time I put one of them...
- All the way!

569
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,842
Fundamental shit,
you throw your two fingers at it.

570
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:22,138
Got another one in ya?

571
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:24,265
It's the moment, man. It's the moment!

572
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:27,435
That Zen Buddhism shit,
y'all get in the moment and stay here.

573
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:32,523
Just stay in the moment till next October,
then we know where the hell we are.

574
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:40,865
<i>Champs,
world champs, NBA mack daddies.</i>

575
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:43,951
<i>Chicago completing
its second three-peat this decade.</i>

576
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:47,830
<i>Tens of thousands of fans
in Chicago's Grant Park,</i>

577
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,248
<i>chanting, "One more year!"</i>

578
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:50,875
One more year!

579
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:54,253
I wanna tell Jerry Reinsdorf
he'd better bring 'em back.

580
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:57,006
Because if he doesn't,
we're gonna ride him out of town.

581
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:04,805
<i>And now,
your six-time world champion</i>

582
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,807
<i>Chicago Bulls!</i>

583
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:15,983
About a year ago,
Jerry Reinsdorf called me and asked me,

584
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,777
did I think we could do it again?

585
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:21,989
I said yes.

586
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:26,118
Without Scottie coming back,
we never would have got it done.

587
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:29,789
And Michael loaded us up on his shoulders
and carried us home.

588
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:37,046
And I want to thank Jerry Krause
for giving us the opportunity to do it.

589
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:40,383
He had another plan, but he put it aside.

590
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:41,466
Thanks, Jerry.

591
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:45,179
We can't knock him.
We gotta give him credit.

592
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:50,184
He deserves the credit because
he was the general manager of those teams.

593
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:55,940
I've had a lot of great people in my life,
and that's why my success happened.

594
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:59,568
I played with Phil Jackson,
the greatest coach in the game.

595
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:01,946
Michael Jordan, the greatest player
in the game.

596
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:05,700
Jerry Krause, obviously the greatest
general manager in the game.

597
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:10,830
I want to thank all my teammates,
the organization. It's been a great run.

598
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,291
Thank you for our last dance.

599
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:21,215
I know a lot of people didn't think
we'd end up back in Grant Park this year.

600
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:25,303
Nobody knows if we're gonna be
in Grant Park next year.

601
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:34,145
But the one thing I do know is
my heart, my soul and my love

602
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:36,397
has always gone to the city of Chicago.

603
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:44,155
And I do know that,
no matter what happens,

604
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:47,992
my heart and my soul and my love
will still be in the city of Chicago.

605
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:55,958
You have to
almost appreciate his celebrity even more.

606
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:59,670
Because he didn't have those platforms
to be known worldwide.

607
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:03,507
There was no ability to promote yourself
through social media,

608
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:07,887
to post videos, no tweets,
nothing like that.

609
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,680
He was known for his play

610
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:12,558
and for having
this larger-than-life persona.

611
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:19,732
I'm most proud of the impact

612
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:23,069
that those teams had
on the city of Chicago and the fans.

613
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:28,449
When we had the celebrations after
each of the championships in Grant Park,

614
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:33,204
and to look out over a crowd of faces as
far as you can see, and they're all happy.

615
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:36,874
They're all happy. It makes you feel good
that you played some role

616
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:38,876
in bringing happiness to these people.

617
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:43,255
In '92,
the NBA was in 80 countries.

618
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:47,343
And now the NBA is in 215 countries.

619
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:51,472
Anyone who understands that phenomenon
of that historical arc

620
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:54,600
will understand
that Michael Jordan and his era

621
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:56,811
played an incredibly important part in it.

622
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:59,146
He advanced us tremendously.

623
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:07,863
There are great players who don't have
an impact beyond their sport.

624
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:14,829
And then there are certain sports figures
who become a larger cultural force.

625
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:19,834
Michael Jordan helped
to create a different way

626
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:23,212
in which people thought about
the African-American athlete,

627
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:27,508
a different way in which
people saw athletics

628
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:30,845
as part of the entertainment business.

629
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:36,016
He became an extraordinary ambassador
not just for basketball,

630
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,644
but I think for
the United States overseas,

631
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:42,523
and part of American culture
sweeping the globe.

632
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:45,609
Michael Jordan and the Bulls...

633
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:48,487
changed the culture.

634
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:05,171
That night, Jerry Reinsdorf called me up,
and he asked me to come back.

635
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,007
After the sixth championship,

636
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:10,426
I offered him the opportunity
to come back.

637
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:12,761
"You've earned the chance,
the opportunity to come back,

638
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:15,139
regardless of what was said before now."

639
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:19,268
I said, "Well, I think I should
just take a break."

640
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:23,272
I said, "I don't think it's fair to Jerry,

641
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:25,983
and I know it'd be difficult for him
to accept that."

642
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:28,194
Let me play you...

643
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:32,114
This is Jerry Reinsdorf saying why
he had to break the team up.

644
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:33,491
- Reinsdorf?
- Yeah.

645
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:36,994
I can't wait to hear this.
I never understood...

646
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:40,956
We've never had any dialogue about why.
I made my own assumptions why.

647
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:47,304
<i>Now after
the sixth championship,</i>

648
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:48,578
<i>things were beyond our control.</i>

649
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:51,759
Because it would have been suicidal

650
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:54,094
at that point in their careers,
to bring back...

651
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:58,098
Pippen, Steve Kerr, Rodman, Ron Harper.

652
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:01,769
Their market value individually
was gonna be too high.

653
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:04,522
They weren't gonna be worth the money
they'd get in the market.

654
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:09,777
<i>So, when we realized that we were
gonna have to go into a rebuild,</i>

655
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,238
<i>I went to Phil and offered him</i>

656
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:14,448
<i>the opportunity to come back
the next year.</i>

657
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:17,159
<i>But he said,
"I don't wanna go through a rebuild.</i>

658
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:18,869
<i>I don't wanna coach a bad team."</i>

659
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:21,789
<i>That was the end.
It just came to an end on its own.</i>

660
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:25,543
<i>You know, had Michael been healthy
and wanted to come back,</i>

661
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:28,754
<i>I don't doubt that Krause could've rebuilt
another championship team</i>

662
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:32,216
<i>in a couple years. But, yeah,
it wasn't gonna happen instantly.</i>

663
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:43,269
In '98... Krause already said
at the beginning of the season,

664
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:47,314
Phil can go 82-0,
and he was never gonna be the coach.

665
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:51,986
So, when Phil said it was the last dance,
it was the last dance.

666
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:54,405
We knew they weren't gonna keep the team.

667
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:58,534
Now, they could have nixed all of it
at the beginning of '98.

668
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:01,036
Why say that statement
at the beginning of '98?

669
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,414
If you ask all the guys who won in '98...

670
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:06,166
Steve Kerr, Jud Buechler,
blah, blah, blah...

671
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:09,169
"We give you one-year contract
to try for the seventh."

672
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:12,673
You think they would've signed?
Yes, they would've signed.

673
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:15,342
Would I have signed for one year?
Yes, I would have.

674
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:18,095
I'd been signing one-year contracts
up to that.

675
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:20,264
Would Phil have done it? Yes.

676
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:22,766
Now, Pip,
you would've had to do some convincing,

677
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,476
but if Phil was gonna be there,

678
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,271
if Dennis was gonna be there,
if MJ was gonna be there,

679
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:31,150
to win our seventh,
Pip is not gonna miss out on that.

680
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:35,195
You know, '91-'92, I was...

681
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:39,825
I was young, full of energy, hungry.

682
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:44,204
In '98, when you're winning
six out of eight,

683
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:48,334
and yet being just as dominant
as you were in '91,

684
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:52,171
that's where the craftsmanship came in.

685
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:55,674
I think '98 was much better
than any of the other years

686
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:59,762
because of how I was able to use my mind
as well as my body.

687
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:04,224
So was it then satisfying
to leave at your peak?

688
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,224
No.

689
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:07,394
Or is it maddening
to leave at your peak?

690
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:10,272
It's maddening, yeah,
because I felt like...

691
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:12,775
we could have won seven.

692
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:15,611
I really believe that.

693
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:19,782
We may not have, but, man,
just not to be able to try,

694
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:23,952
that's something that I just can't accept.

695
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:26,246
For whatever reason,
I just can't accept it.

696
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:31,543
This is a good time to go.

697
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:35,214
It's a great run,
we'd had a wonderful time. Good team.

698
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:38,132
Time to go.

699
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:49,853
I remember there was this
team meeting with Phil...

700
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:53,899
and it was like, "This is it."

701
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:59,196
My wife had gotten her master's
in social work

702
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:03,117
and she was part of a group that went in
to help people who were grieving.

703
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:10,249
One of the things they did was a ritual,
in which they put things to rest.

704
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:17,589
He says, "This is it, the last dance.
Last time we're ever gonna be together."

705
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:24,138
He asked everybody to bring in
anything you want to write

706
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:26,181
about what the team means to you.

707
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:30,644
"Write what being on this team
has meant to you during this year...

708
00:45:31,186 --> 00:45:33,522
and read it and we'll burn it
in a coffee can."

709
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:37,985
And every guy
had emotional words to say.

710
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:40,696
And I remember
Michael actually wrote a poem.

711
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:46,660
It was a depth of emotion
that you never thought he had.

712
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:50,539
<i>♪ You can spend your time alone ♪</i>

713
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:52,791
Phil had this knack,

714
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:55,753
no matter how big you are
or how big you think you are,

715
00:45:55,836 --> 00:46:00,174
to always draw you in
to be a part of the process.

716
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:05,179
I'm not a poet.
I just spoke what I felt at the time.

717
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,390
We're always gonna be bonded.

718
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:13,187
You say thanks for the past,
enjoy the moment.

719
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:15,272
Let's make sure we end it right.

720
00:46:17,232 --> 00:46:19,735
We saw him as this bully sometimes.

721
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:24,156
But that day, he showed his compassion
and his empathy for all of us.

722
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:28,744
Then everybody put the paper in the can,
and at the end of the session...

723
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:33,248
Phil turned out the lights
and he lit the paper in the can.

724
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:36,919
It's one of the most powerful things
I've ever seen.

725
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:41,507
<i>♪ You can spend your time alone ♪</i>

726
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:45,052
<i>♪ Re-digesting past regrets, oh ♪</i>

727
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:50,182
When I look back, it's very gratifying
to come from Wilmington, North Carolina,

728
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:53,060
and never been in Chicago

729
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:57,064
but that became my home
and became a part of my history.

730
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:05,656
My passion on the basketball court
should have been infectious

731
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:09,493
because that's how I tried to play.
I played for them.

732
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:11,954
Start with hope.

733
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:13,997
Start with hope.

734
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:17,626
<i>♪ In the present tense ♪</i>

735
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:21,922
We went from a shitty team...

736
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:26,176
to one of the all-time best dynasties.

737
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:29,471
All you needed was one little match...

738
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:32,349
to start that whole fire.

739
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:39,815
<i>Stolen by Pippen!
Scottie Pippen, a great play!</i>

740
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:47,364
<i>Here's Michael
at the foul line, a shot on Ehlo... Good!</i>

741
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:49,950
<i>The Bulls win it!
They win it!</i>

742
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:03,755
<i>A spectacular move by Michael Jordan!</i>

743
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:41,209
I just want the franchise
and Chicago Bulls to be respected.

744
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:44,504
Like the Lakers or the Philadelphia 76ers
or the Boston Celtics.

745
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:46,840
Hopefully I can... That this team

746
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:49,635
and this organization
can build a program like that.
