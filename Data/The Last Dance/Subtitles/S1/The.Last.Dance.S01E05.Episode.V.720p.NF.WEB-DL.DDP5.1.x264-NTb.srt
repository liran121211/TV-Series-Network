00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:19,399
<i>Michael Jordan
has said it many times.</i>

2
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:23,314
<i>He considers Madison Square Garden to be
the mecca of basketball.</i>

3
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,945
<i>If, in fact, this is his final
NBA All-Star Game,</i>

4
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,489
<i>it's a perfect place
to make a last statement.</i>

5
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:34,409
<i>On the verge
of a repeat three-peat,</i>

6
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:36,786
<i>Michael Jordan is playing his last year.</i>

7
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,331
<i>Bulls GM Jerry Krause swore on Wednesday</i>

8
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:43,001
<i>that Phil Jackson
would not return next year,</i>

9
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:45,462
<i>and said if Michael chooses to leave</i>

10
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,797
<i>because there was another coach,
then it's his choice.</i>

11
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,424
- Boy! Hey!
- What's up?

12
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:50,967
Hey, your feet look good!

13
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:55,680
<i>Kobe Bryant,
the youngest All-Star in history</i>

14
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:58,725
<i>- at 19 years, five months.
- I've talked to him.</i>

15
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:00,528
<i>It's the same thing.
He's a 19-year-old kid.</i>

16
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,105
<i>They're saying, "Kobe, you look ready
to be the man at the All-Star Game."</i>

17
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:06,357
<i>You can't forget the king
is still on the court.</i>

18
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:09,027
<i>♪ If I ruled the world ♪</i>

19
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:12,030
Michael's going here?

20
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:14,967
- There you go.
<i>- </i>You get the chair.

21
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:18,369
Man, I must be the old guy.
I remember I used to be way in the back.

22
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,533
We gave you
a nice, comfortable chair.

23
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:28,630
So you're feeling all right, huh?

24
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:31,007
I guess so,
since you're gonna play me 40 minutes.

25
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,926
You better be ready.

26
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,469
Good shots out there.

27
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:36,947
If you don't have anything
in the middle, kick it out,

28
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:39,451
make that extra pass,
somebody should be wide open for a three.

29
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,268
While we're here, we might as well win.

30
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:43,832
- Yeah.
- Right?

31
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:47,148
That Laker boy's
gonna take everybody one-on-one.

32
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,399
I know, right?

33
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,777
- Yeah!
- Who, Kobe? Yeah.

34
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:54,823
He don't let the game come
to him. He just go out there and take it.

35
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:59,244
I'm going to make this shit happen.
I'm gonna make this a one-on-one game.

36
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:03,189
I figured after the first four
attempts didn't go in, he was gonna chill.

37
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,082
What?

38
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:05,792
After the first four attempts?

39
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,628
If I was his teammate,
I wouldn't pass him the fucking ball!

40
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:12,882
You want this ball again, brother,
you better rebound.

41
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:18,680
- This is the East locker room.
- Hold up, hold up.

42
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:21,200
- Got nothing to do with the West.
- Hold up.

43
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:24,519
He got nothing
but his damn Laker colors on.

44
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:26,604
Yeah, yeah, like he coaching.

45
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,899
Now, I'm with the old motherf... Oops!

46
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,985
- The old mugs.
- There ain't many of us here.

47
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:34,320
That's why I come to say
"What's up?" to my boy.

48
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,844
- What's happening? How you doing?
- How you feeling?

49
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:37,906
Damn!

50
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,242
Good, man.

51
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,427
- Michael...
- I'm lovin' it.

52
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:42,662
Would you like to have
some of his ass today?

53
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:45,582
Hey, you know
I'd be coming at him, Larry.

54
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:48,084
Just like I used to come
at both of y'all.

55
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,672
<i>Just about tip-off time
at Madison Square Garden</i>

56
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:55,175
<i>for the 48th NBA All-Star Game.</i>

57
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,886
<i>And there you see Kobe Bryant
in the foreground,</i>

58
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:00,221
<i>the man many have dubbed
the next Michael Jordan.</i>

59
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:02,056
I got Mike, I got Mike.

60
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,975
- <i>Here is Michael.</i>
- Ah!

61
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,395
<i>Count it,
plus the foul for Jordan!</i>

62
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:13,276
I grew up watching Michael on TV,

63
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,737
and now you got a chance
to go face-to-face with him.

64
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,907
You get a chance to really see
and touch and feel...

65
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:23,369
the strength, speed, quickness. And, um...

66
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,747
It was fun to be out there.

67
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,082
<i>He's got the ball
in his hands again.</i>

68
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,001
<i>To Garnett. Back to Kobe!</i>

69
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:31,085
Oh!

70
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:35,423
He just wants to get
to the offensive end and go one-on-one.

71
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:37,026
I'm gonna make his ass work down here.

72
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,771
He make it out,
we gotta get back!

73
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:40,261
He hauling ass.

74
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,805
I ain't tryin' to be down there
on a poster, dog.

75
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:45,308
I ain't jumpin' with him. No.

76
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,745
It was a rough couple of years for me,
coming to the league.

77
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,649
At the time, the league was much older.
It's not as young as it is today.

78
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:53,691
So, nobody was really thinking much of me.

79
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:57,445
I was the kid that... shot a bunch
of air-balls, you know what I mean?

80
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:01,449
And at that point, Michael provided
a lot of guidance for me.

81
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:04,702
I had a question
about shooting his turnaround shot,

82
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:05,995
so I asked him about it.

83
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:09,165
And he gave me a great, detailed answer,

84
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:13,127
but on top of that, he said, "If you ever
need anything, give me a call."

85
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,463
He's like my big brother.

86
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:23,263
I truly hate having discussions
about who would win one-on-one,

87
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,933
and fans saying, "Kobe,
you'd beat Michael one-on-one."

88
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,351
And I feel like, "Yo!

89
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:31,187
What you get from me
is from him."

90
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:36,109
I don't get five championships here
without him,

91
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:39,737
'cause he guided me so much
and he gave me so much great advice.

92
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,501
<i>Kobe had challenged Michael.</i>

93
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:45,702
<i>Michael comes out and he's saying,
"Not tonight, young fella. Uh-uh, Kobe.</i>

94
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,954
<i>I got some more tricks left in my bag."</i>

95
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:50,415
<i>He's not ready to leave yet, folks.</i>

96
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,918
Great job, guys.
Hey, Jordan, you're my boy.

97
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,254
Thank you. You know it, you know it.

98
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:58,506
- I'll see you down the road.
- Cool.

99
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:00,049
- Congratulations.
- You're my boy.

100
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,719
See you in the Finals. Hopefully.

101
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:05,138
- Y'all gonna be there.
- I know we will.

102
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:06,639
I ain't that soft!

103
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,223
Big Daddy!

104
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,394
I'm only gonna allow him
to have his trophy

105
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:14,355
if he promises to come back
and do it again.

106
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:22,780
The All-Star of All-Stars,
the MVP, Michael Jordan.

107
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,615
If there was ever any doubt

108
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:27,785
that he could've kept playing
at an MVP and championship level...

109
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:30,705
there's the All-Star Game, he's the MVP.

110
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:34,375
He's still the star among stars.

111
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:37,503
Even though there were
explanations offered,

112
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:41,049
people couldn't understand
why he was gonna step away.

113
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,967
The public wanted him to keep going.

114
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,513
<i>A spectacular move!</i>

115
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,182
<i>The game's over!</i>

116
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:51,601
<i>Chicago Stadium is going wild!</i>

117
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:56,064
<i>First of all,
there's no backstabbing going on here.</i>

118
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,023
<i>It's time for me to move on.</i>

119
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:59,506
<i>This will be Phil's last year
as coach of the Bulls.</i>

120
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:04,673
- <i>Are the expectations too high?
- Where do we go from here?</i>

121
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,200
<i>The only question: how long can it last?</i>

122
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:29,430
Knowing this is the last dance,
unless something actually changes,

123
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,350
I went into Madison Square Garden,

124
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,894
"This is the last time
I'm gonna be playing here."

125
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,397
And that was my favorite place to play.

126
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:43,945
Went back and grabbed
an old pair of Jordan 1s.

127
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,115
It's the first shoe I wore in the Garden,

128
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:49,158
so this was gonna be the last shoe,

129
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,482
being that this was the last time
I'd play in the Garden.

130

Sweet. You laced those.

135
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,309
Toni, you weren't around.
You was a baby when I broke these out.

136
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,641
What was the year?

137
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:16,519
- '84. How old were you?
- That's when I started.

138
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:17,812
You were 12 years old.

139
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:19,801
Toni was still in diapers.

140
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,732
You look at these shoes,

141
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:24,068
you put these shoes on
then put on some of them...

142
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,864
Innovation has taken a long turn.

143
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:50,970
I first met Michael Jordan in 1984.
I went to North Carolina

144
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:53,473
to interview Michael and his family
to represent him.

145
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:56,934
His parents asked great questions.

146
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,645
They were very intelligent,
extremely personable.

147
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:04,692
Our firm, ProServ, had a lot of
very high-profile tennis clients,

148
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:07,320
like Jimmy Connors,
Stan Smith, Arthur Ashe.

149
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:10,281
Arthur Ashe had his own shoes
and tennis racket.

150
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:15,495
This is the racket I won Wimbledon with.
You could've bought it. Really.

151
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:19,499
The strategy was to try to take
a team sport player

152
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:23,127
and treat him more like a golfer
or a boxer or a tennis player.

153
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:25,922
I said to David,
"What are you trying to do?

154
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,424
You trying to turn this guy
into a tennis player?

155
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,427
He's a basketball player,
he's not a tennis player."

156
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:36,807
I said, "That's exactly what I'm trying
to do." And the very first deal was shoes.

157
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,477
We took him out to meet Converse,

158
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,230
which, at that time,
was the official shoe of the NBA.

00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:02,542
Converse had big players,
and told me, "We cannot...

166
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:05,336
envision you being put ahead of them."

167
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,296
Okay. Fine.

168
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,067
Did you have a shoe company
that you wanted to go with?

169
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,091
That was Adidas.

170
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:15,263
I like the Lakers
and I like Marques Johnson.

171
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:17,765
And I like Adidas. I like the Adidas shoe.

172
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:21,811
Adidas was really dysfunctional
by that time.

173
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,313
They had just told me,
"We'd love to have Jordan.

174
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,983
We just can't make a shoe work
at this point in time."

175
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:31,779
I wanted Michael to go with Nike
because they were the upstart.

176
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:37,118
In the early '80s, Nike was,
for the most part, a track shoe company.

177
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:41,330
Michael didn't even wanna be at Nike.

178
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:45,710
I couldn't even get him to get on
the damn plane and go visit the campus,

179
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,628
so I called his parents.

180
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,672
My mother said,
"You're gonna go listen.

181
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,882
You may not like it,
but you're gonna go listen."

182
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,677
"Mom, I don't wanna hear it.
I know what I wanna do.

183
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,554
I am not going to Nike's, Mama."

184
00:09:56,637 --> 00:10:00,516
I says, "Michael,
you have to give 'em an opportunity."

185
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,643
She made me go on that plane
and go listen.

186
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,772
I go into that meeting,
not wanting to be there.

187
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,525
Nike made this big pitch.

188
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,737
My father said, "You gotta be a fool
for not taking this deal."

189
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:20,786
Back then, the best guys might've gotten
$100,000 or so,

190
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,372
and he got probably $250,000.

191
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,457
It was like...

192
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,001
"You will pay him what?

193
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:29,045
A young rookie...

194
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,589
that's done nothing?

195
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,008
You must be out of your mind."

196
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,929
When I negotiated the Nike deal,
I said to them,

197
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:41,474
"You're a small company,
and if you want Michael Jordan,

198
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:43,559
he's gotta have his own shoe line."

199
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:46,854
Nike had just come out
with this new technology

200
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:49,398
for their running shoes called Air Soles.

201
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,567
And obviously, Michael played in the air.

202
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,819
I said, "I got it.
We're gonna call it Air Jordan."

203
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:58,449
"Air Jordan"?
That got a pretty good ring to it.

204
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,705
Nike's expectation,
when we signed the deal,

205
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,666
was at the end of year four,

206
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:10,419
they hoped to sell $3 million
worth of Air Jordans.

207
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,089
In year one, we sold $126 million.

208
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,691
<i>♪ I get paid when my record is played ♪</i>

209
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:15,883
<i>♪ To put it short ♪</i>

210
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,719
<i>♪ I got it made ♪</i>

211
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,016
<i>As a commodity,</i>

212
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,936
<i>Michael Jordan is as hot
as a Cabbage Patch doll right now.</i>

213
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,063
<i>The endorsements are fast and furious.</i>

214
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:31,482
<i>The photo sessions seem endless.</i>

215
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:32,805
<i>Like a politician,</i>

216
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,898
<i>Jordan moves gracefully
through a crowd of admirers,</i>

217
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:37,988
<i>sipping orange juice,
collecting business cards.</i>

218
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:41,534
<i>Deals have already been cut with
Wilson Sporting Goods, McDonald's...</i>

219
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:49,208
For a kid, it was almost like...
holding a lightsaber from <i>Star Wars.</i>

220
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,544
You needed that shoe to be like him.

221
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:53,963
It was more than a status symbol.

222
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,257
You knew this guy was the guy.

223
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,926
<i>♪ 'Cause I got it made ♪</i>

224
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,928
They came in different styles.

225
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:04,223
The other brands didn't change too much.
Jordans changed with the times.

226
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:07,768
Everybody was like,
"You gotta get a pair of Jordans."

227
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:11,313
And so, every year we would save up money.

228
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,858
I would cut grass, and do chores,

229
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,444
and save up money,
and wait in line at Foot Locker.

230
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:21,574
Before Michael Jordan,
sneakers were just for playing basketball.

231
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:27,037
And all of a sudden,
sneakers became fashion and culture.

232
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:30,082
My first film was <i>She's Gotta Have It.</i>

233
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,919
I played a character called Mars Blackmon.
And I made sure that Mars

234
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,838
would be wearing a pair of Air Jordans

235
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,924
because Michael is the hero
of the youth today.

236
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:45,890
You stepped on my brand new
white Air Jordans that I just bought.

237
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,743
- How much you pay for 'em?
- A hundred bucks!

238
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,727
- American dollars!
- $108 with tax!

239
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,353
I'd give him 100 headaches.

240
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:56,484
And the fact that Nike used Spike Lee
to produce Jordan commercials

241
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:59,278
suddenly brought urban culture

242
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:01,405
and crossed it together with sports.

243
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:02,323
Mark.

244
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:05,785
Yo! Mars Blackmon here
with my main man Michael Jordan.

245
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:08,329
Yo, Mike, what makes you
the best player in the universe?

246
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:10,706
- Is it the vicious dunks?
- No, Mars.

247
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,666
- Is it the haircut?
- No, Mars.

248
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,127
- Is it the shoes?
- No, Mars.

249
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,712
Money, it's gotta be the shoes.

250
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,422
Shoes. Shoes. Shoes. Shoes.

251
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,674
- You sure it's not the shoes?
- I'm sure, Mars.

252
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,218
Cut!

253
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,428
My game
was my biggest endorsement.

254
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:28,307
What I did on the basketball court,
my dedication to the game,

255
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,934
led to all this other stuff.

256
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:33,395
Believe me, if I was averaging two points,
three rebounds,

257
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,023
I wouldn't have signed anything
with anybody.

258
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:38,025
So, my game did all my talking.

259
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,739
<i>We are back at Madison Square Garden.</i>

260
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,301
<i>Michael Jordan wearing
the original Air Jordans</i>

261
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:50,287
<i>that he wore the first time he played
at Madison Square Garden back in 1984.</i>

262
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,623
<i>And Michael will get
a standing ovation</i>

263
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,375
<i>from the Garden crowd here.</i>

264
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:04,218
<i>Michael. Two seconds
to shoot. Over Houston. Got it!</i>

265
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,345
<i>It must be the shoes.</i>

266
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,932
<i>Michael... hits again!</i>

267
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,246
<i>This is beautiful
basketball that we're watching.</i>

268
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,068
By half-time, my feet are bleeding.

269
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,113
But I'm having a good game.
I don't wanna take 'em off.

270
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,908
<i>Michael... Oh, my goodness!</i>

271
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,829
<i>A number of the players and even
two of the officials are laughing.</i>

272
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,706
<i>Michael Jordan now has 40 points.</i>

273
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:37,418
<i>And only one guy
has this level of artistry.</i>

274
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,379
<i>Spinning in the lane for the slam!</i>

275
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,923
<i>And Spike Lee
is all over Michael Jordan,</i>

276
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,634
<i>and Michael has a few words
by way of retort.</i>

277
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,078
<i>He just told him
that he couldn't guard him.</i>

278
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,723
<i>He said, "You can't guard me.
You too little."</i>

279
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:55,311
<i>Then he says, "You come out here."
Spike says, "I will, Money."</i>

280
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,690
<i>Michael with 42,</i>

281
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:02,902
<i>and if this was Michael Jordan's
final game at Madison Square Garden,</i>

282
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:06,989
<i>he leaves no doubt whatsoever
that he exits just as he entered.</i>

283
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,574
<i>The best there is.</i>

284
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,368
I couldn't take those shoes off
fast enough.

285
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:15,289
And when I took the shoes off,
my sock was soaked in blood.

286
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,542
It's kind of fun to
come back here and play,

287
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,961
and remember some of the old days
and some of the things...

288
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:24,590
Some of the games that I've had here,
and the shoes was a part of that...

289
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:26,091
My feet are killing me.

290
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,636
- Michael!
- Michael!

291
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:38,062
Close that door.
Hey, close that door!

292
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,565
I had to go back to all the way to '84
to whip y'all ass.

293
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,025
- Don't start that shit.
- I won't.

294
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,234
How you been doing?

295
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,802
Prior to the season of '92,

296
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:13,013
the team talked about the difficulty
of repeating.

297
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,933
And we had this statement,
"You're only a success

298
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:18,352
at the moment you perform
a successful act."

299
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:19,645
You have to do it again.

300
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:30,864
<i>Jordan with the block
and then the save, which was unbelievable.</i>

301
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:39,039
I've always thought that the '92 team
was maybe the best Bulls team ever.

302
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,291
<i>♪ You can get with this
Or you can get with that ♪</i>

303
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,877
<i>♪ You can get with this
Or you can get with that ♪</i>

304
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,005
<i>♪ You can get with this
Or you can get with that ♪</i>

305
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,400
<i>♪ I think you'll go with this
'Cause this is where it's at ♪</i>

306
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,884
<i>♪ You can get with this
Or you can get with that ♪</i>

307
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:57,057
Starting with that season, I felt Michael
never played basketball anymore.

308
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,809
He just figured out how to win the game.

309
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:04,773
He knew how to steer momentum,
he knew how to get guys going.

310
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:08,277
And not only was he that good
on the offensive end,

311
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,279
he was just as good on the defensive end.

312
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,949
He was just playing a different game
than the rest of us.

313
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:18,579
He'd let us play.
But he was there to win the game.

314
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,456
And he knew that.

315
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:23,959
And once he figured that out,
you couldn't beat him.

316
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:28,505
<i>Good evening,
basketball fans, wherever you may be.</i>

317
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:33,427
<i>Tonight begins the 1992 NBA Finals.</i>

318
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:37,532
<i>The Chicago Bulls,
the Portland Trail Blazers.</i>

319
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,684
<i>The two best teams in the NBA
go head-to-head.</i>

320
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:43,896
<i>We have two great teams
led by two superstar players.</i>

321
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:47,608
<i>All eyes will be focused on the matchup
of Drexler and Jordan.</i>

322
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:49,193
<i>When you look at these two players,</i>

323
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,612
<i>there's not a whole lot of difference
between 'em.</i>

324
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:55,616
Both had outstanding seasons, seasons that
statistically mirrored each other.

325
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,161
<i>Clyde The Glide says,
"We're the two best in the game,</i>

326
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,747
<i>but I'm not getting into
a war of words with Mike."</i>

327
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:05,250
Clyde was a threat.
I'm not saying he wasn't a threat.

328
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:08,670
But me being compared to him,
I took offense to that.

329
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,756
I'm working for NBC.

330
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:12,966
I'm covering the Finals.

331
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:19,014
So, the night before game one,
we're at Michael's house, playing cards,

332
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,683
and he said, "You know
what's gonna happen tomorrow.

333
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,435
I'm gonna give it to this dude."

334
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:27,534
<i>And the matchup
at the start,</i>

335
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:30,484
<i>Michael Jordan facing Clyde Drexler.</i>

336
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:35,030
<i>Jordan... from three-point land!</i>

337
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,365
So he hit that first three.

338
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:39,219
- <i>Here's Pippen.
- </i>And then here come the second.

339
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:42,579
- <i>Open for another three!
- </i>The third one.

340
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:45,124
<i>Back to Jordan.
And hit for three!</i>

341
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,918
<i>That's his fourth three-point field goal.</i>

342
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:53,882
<i>Michael Jordan, with four three-pointers
in a half, has tied the NBA Finals record.</i>

343
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:58,345
Michael didn't want anybody
to have nothing over him.

344
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:01,014
<i>Jordan for three! Yes!</i>

345
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:07,813
<i>An NBA Finals record.
Five three-pointers in a half.</i>

346
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:12,025
And every time he hit a three,
he glanced over at me, at the NBC table.

347
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:15,404
<i>Here's Jordan again
from downtown.</i>

348
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:21,243
<i>Did you see that look?
Michael indicating he can't believe it.</i>

349
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:29,293
<i>An NBA championship record,
35 points in the half.</i>

350
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:32,546
And he was like...
"I'm killing this dude."

351
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,970
Based on the way I was playing
at that time, it wasn't even close.

352
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,806
So I attacked him every night.

353
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:47,811
<i>Here's Jordan.</i>

354
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:54,443
<i>Jordan. Nice.</i>

355
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,819
<i>Thirty-five seconds.</i>

356
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:57,779
<i>Grant wide open!</i>

357
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:05,412
<i>What a move by Jordan!
Amazing! And hitting!</i>

358
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:13,545
<i>Four-point Chicago lead.</i>

359
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:17,090
<i>Drexler with the check. He thought
there might be a timeout remaining.</i>

360
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:29,061
<i>The Chicago Bulls have won
the NBA championship</i>

361
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:31,230
<i>for the second straight season!</i>

362
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:41,949
One is great, two is almost impossible.
Congratulations, Chicago.

363
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:44,993
This is the happiest moment
in many, many years!

364
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:48,997
It feels so good. Oh, boy!

365
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:52,709
The one thing I would say, and I'd say it
from Jerry Reinsdorf on down,

366
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,795
this is a great organization.

367
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:56,880
This organization is special.

368
00:20:56,964 --> 00:21:00,259
From Jerry... It starts with Jerry,
and it goes down all the way to Joe Lee,

369
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,761
our clubhouse guy
who's been here 25 years.

370
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:05,514
It's an organization thing,
and that's what it's all about.

371
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:08,850
The team is great, but the organization
is one of the all-time great,

372
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:12,521
if not the greatest organization ever.
That's what I'm so much proud of.

373
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,608
- Are you smoking a cigar, Mike?
- Yeah.

374
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:17,692
Give me one.

375
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:20,404
You can't smoke it.
It will stunt your growth.

376
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:25,284
Coming off
his second championship...

377
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:29,079
second Finals MVP, second MVP season,

378
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,873
Michael was the king of the world.

379
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:38,046
And it was the first year that we were
trying to get the pros into the Olympics.

380
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,382
When are you putting on
the USAB sneakers?

381
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:43,802
Uh... It's a week from Sunday, isn't it?

382
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:44,928
Yeah.

383
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:47,639
Yeah, but I got a lot of partying to do
from now until then.

384
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,392
- Hey, Phil!
- I'm in charge of it today.

385
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:51,893
He knows the neighborhood.

386
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:54,062
I tell you, the Olympics...

387
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:57,190
If Chuck Daly plays me
over ten minutes, I'm quitting.

388
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:15,334
With the United States Basketball
taking a beating at international play,

389
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:19,046
the call went out for NBA help.
The result?

390
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:21,882
In 1992, for the first time,

391
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:25,927
a team of mostly NBA players
will defend America's Olympic pride.

392
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:31,433
Before the '92 Olympics,

393
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:36,438
Rod Thorn calls me and says, "We would
love for you to be on the Dream Team."

394
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,607
I says, "Who's all playing?"

395
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:42,819
He says, "What does that mean?"
I said, "Who's all playing?"

396
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:46,448
He says,
"Well, the guy you're talking about

397
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,950
or you're thinking about
is not gonna be playing."

398
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:53,372
We're going
to ask a few things about the Olympics.

399
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:55,248
All right. No Isiah Thomas stuff.

400
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:57,172
- No Isiah Thomas questions.
- Cool.

401
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:00,045
Now there has been speculation

402
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:04,424
that your icy relationship
with Isiah Thomas

403
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:07,803
is the reason that he was not selected.

404
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,514
I respect Isiah Thomas' talent.

405
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:14,434
To me, the best point guard
of all time is Magic Johnson

406
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,478
and right behind him is Isiah Thomas.

407
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:20,315
No matter how much I hate him,
I respect his game.

408
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:23,026
Now, it was insinuated
that I was asking about him,

409
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,445
but I never threw his name in there.

410
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:29,199
I don't know what went into that process.

411
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:33,328
I met the criteria to be selected.

412
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:35,414
But I wasn't.

413
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:38,917
The Dream Team, based on the environment,

414
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:42,546
and the camaraderie that happened
on that team...

415
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,006
It was the best harmony.

416
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:48,677
Would Isiah have made
a different feeling on that team? Yes.

417
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:53,849
- <i>Magic Johnson angry.
- He's very upset.</i>

418
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,685
At that point, Magic and Isiah
had had their thing.

419
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,521
Bird and Isiah have had their thing.

420
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:03,358
And Scottie. That's half the team.

421
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,860
They did not want to play with him.

422
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,654
Everybody puts it on Michael

423
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:10,115
'cause we knew that dislike
was out in the open.

424
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:13,827
<i>They left the bench
although there's 7.9 seconds remaining.</i>

425
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,704
<i>The Pistons just left.</i>

426
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:17,497
But there was a lot more to it than that.

427
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:22,210
You want to attribute it to me, go ahead,
be my guest, but it wasn't me.

428
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:25,839
<i>With Jordan, Pippen, Magic
and Bird leading the way,</i>

429
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:28,717
<i>this team's billed as
the greatest ever assembled.</i>

430
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,188
<i>What did you treasure
the most</i>

431
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,721
<i>about that experience that summer?</i>

432
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:35,807
The practices... and the camaraderie.

433
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:38,059
You know, how the guys bonded together.

434
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:42,314
<i>♪ Sometime I dream
That he is me ♪</i>

435
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,817
<i>♪ I just wanna be like Chuck...
I mean, Mike ♪</i>

436
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,653
Great!

437
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:51,031
You can't get too close to Michael.
It's a foul.

438
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:52,991
Hey.

439
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:57,162
You haven't committed a foul in almost
a year and a half, man. How can you talk?

440
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:58,997
My goodness.

441
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:02,042
I don't think you ever
fouled out of a game.

442
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:03,668
When did he ever foul out of the game?

443
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:07,422
I'm the young guy
with the elder statesmen.

444
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:10,425
That's right, that's right.
They all have to listen to me.

445
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,010
Whatever I say, goes.

446
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,220
Who's that?

447
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:19,017
Man, I had some of my fondest
memories just hanging out with Michael.

448
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:23,730
We played cards every night
against each other,

449
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:27,692
and if I had the upper hand,
he wanted to play another hour.

450
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,070
Another hour.

451
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,864
And then, he never wants to just beat you.

452
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:37,869
He wants to put his foot
on your neck and just...

453
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,664
I mean, "You're not satisfied
with beating me,

454
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:42,207
you wanna crush me, too?"

455
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,124
"Yup."

456
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:46,086
They had a practice game in Monte Carlo.

457
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:52,217
And Magic and Barkley's team
got off to a big lead.

458
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:55,011
- Ball!
- Whoo! Yes!

459
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:59,724
That was the greatest basketball, I think,
that we all were involved in.

460
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:04,437
Great passing, great shooting,
great defense.

461
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,191
All NBA players going back and forth
at each other.

462
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:10,527
Let's go.

463
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:13,029
There was real trash talking
going on from...

464
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:15,282
Particularly from Charles and Magic
toward Michael.

465
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:16,491
Don't be cheatin' on me!

466
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:19,035
Magic always got under Michael's skin
for some reason.

467
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,831
Right there.
Right back at it, baby.

468
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,916
I'm coming after you. Free throws.

469
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,378
It's all right! That's all right!
Here we go!

470
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:32,799
God damn.
You don't play no defense. That's weak.

471
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:35,468
We ain't in Chicago Stadium
no more.

472
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:38,597
We're up about eight points, I think.
Something like that.

473
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,557
And I went over and tapped him.

474
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:46,229
I said, "Look, man, if you don't turn into
Air Jordan, we gonna blow you out."

475
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,566
Man, what did I say that for?

476
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:53,403
Michael proceeded to score
every time down the court.

477
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:56,114
He was like,
"You wanna know who the guy is?

478
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:57,197
Here's who the guy is."

479
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,951
He broke the huddle,
hit a three. Bam!

480
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,621
Came back down, hit another three. Bam!

481
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:05,915
He came through the middle
and just shook everybody. Bam!

482
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:09,586
Before we know, they was up two.

483
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:11,171
Yes!

484
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:12,088
Yes!

485
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:16,134
He drove to the basket
and the referee called a foul,

486
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:20,096
and Magic threw the ball up
to the top of the arena

487
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,724
and was screaming about,

488
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:26,770
"Just like the NBA, he gets every call!
Same thing over here!"

489
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:29,773
All they did was move
the Bulls stadium right here.

490
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:32,442
That's all they did. That's all they did.

491
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:34,653
This is the '90s.

492
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:38,448
I don't care if it's the '90s
or not. What's that supposed to mean?

493
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:40,408
This is the '90s.

494
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:45,205
How you like that ass kicking
we gave y'all?

495
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:46,873
No, no, no. Come on, now.

496
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:52,212
After the practice, they get
on the bus to go back to the hotel.

497
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:57,133
And for a couple of minutes,
there's no talking.

498
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:01,346
When we got on the bus,
it was... It was... Whoo! Man.

499
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:05,308
And all of a sudden,
Magic says to Barkley,

500
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:08,269
"Hey, Charles, I guess we
shouldn't have pissed the man off."

501
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:12,065
And then everybody, "This is
the greatest practice ever. We love this!"

502
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:13,692
Ooh, la, la!

503
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:19,239
After that game, everyone
acknowledged we're in a new era.

504
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:22,826
Michael Jordan was the alpha-alpha.

505
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:25,537
Period.

506
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,722
- Michael!
- What's up?

507
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:29,874
Game on the line,
who would take the last shot?

508
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:30,958
Me.

509
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:33,920
- That's a dumb question. Me.
- Yeah.

510
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:37,924
<i>But now,
a cavalry rides to the rescue.</i>

511
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:39,467
<i>As the Olympics open to NBA players,</i>

512
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:42,637
<i>the US sends
the greatest team ever assembled.</i>

513
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:46,349
<i>The United States will be
the overwhelming favorite in Barcelona.</i>

514
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:49,477
Among the competition, though,
there's one team that stands out.

515
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,813
Like the USA, it's loaded with talent.

516
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:54,524
Croatia has built a basketball powerhouse.

517
00:28:57,777 --> 00:29:02,282
There's Toni Kukoc, the 6'10" wizard
they call the left-handed Magic Johnson.

518
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:05,577
A lot of excitement about
tomorrow's game against Croatia,

519
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:09,456
our first chance to see Toni Kukoc
against this kind of competition.

520
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,583
What do you know about him and them?

521
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:12,876
I don't know a lot about him,

522
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:16,629
but if you listen to Michael and Scottie,
they know a whole lot about him

523
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:19,007
because, apparently,
there was some mixed emotions

524
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,217
about him going to Chicago.

525
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:27,974
With the second pick in the second round,
the Chicago Bulls select Toni Kukoc.

526
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:31,644
Toni's certainly an outstanding
young prospect.

527
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:34,731
I also think
that he's an outstanding young man.

528
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,318
But after I was drafted
by the Bulls,

529
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:41,738
the situation at home was not so great,

530
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:44,115
'cause of the war and everything.

531
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:47,368
<i>Yugoslavia is, of course,
a country divided.</i>

532
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:50,663
<i>In June, two of its republics,
Croatia and Slovenia,</i>

533
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:54,167
<i>declared their independence,
igniting a bloody civil war.</i>

534
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:58,630
I just decided to play
a couple more years in Europe first.

535
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:06,596
Just to be there, kind of,
just to, uh, not take off completely.

536
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:10,350
And I was making
considerably more in Europe

537
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:13,269
than I would make
my first couple of years here.

538
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:17,732
We're not talking a little money,
we're talking a couple million.

539
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:22,362
Jerry went over to watch Toni play
in what was then Yugoslavia

540
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:27,158
and said Toni Kukoc is gonna be
the future of the Chicago Bulls.

541
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:33,373
Jerry was fawning
over Toni so much

542
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:37,293
while our team here
was winning championships.

543
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:41,798
And it just... It rubbed a lot of
the players the wrong way, unfortunately.

544
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:45,385
The timing of this Kukoc thing
is where the problem has been all along.

545
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:47,720
He went out to negotiate with Kukoc

546
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:50,849
while Pippen was waiting to sign
the deal that he's currently under.

547
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:53,476
They put him on hold
while they negotiated with Kukoc.

548
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:58,064
Krause, you know, he's willing to put
someone in front of his actual kids,

549
00:30:58,147 --> 00:31:01,985
who have given him everything
that we could give him.

550
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:07,740
At that time, I have no idea
what was going on with the Bulls.

551
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:11,911
I don't know the frictions between
Scottie and Jerry, Michael and Jerry.

552
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:17,792
So, going to the Olympics,
I kinda thought everything was okay.

553
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:21,963
<i>The major story line
that carries into this game</i>

554
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:24,132
<i>involves European star Toni Kukoc.</i>

555
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:27,719
In the Dream Team locker room,
before the first game against Croatia,

556
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:32,599
Michael just said, "Hey, guys. Kukoc.
Leave him for Scottie and me."

557
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:37,061
<i>Kukoc being played
by Pippen.</i>

558
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:40,189
<i>And Kukoc went to the reverse.</i>

559
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:43,651
<i>There's Jordan with the step on Kukoc.</i>

560
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,447
<i>Kukoc trying to return it,
Pippen with the steal.</i>

561
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,699
Well, I didn't play a good game.

562
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:54,412
I got surprised
by how strict they played defense.

563
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:58,708
I didn't expect somebody to be next to me
literally the whole game.

564
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:03,463
<i>Jordan and Pippen are intent
on showing their superiority.</i>

565
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:08,593
Toni Kukoc became a great teammate
and I love Toni Kukoc for who he is,

566
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:11,804
but the way he was introduced
to me and Scottie was...

567
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:14,891
I didn't appreciate it
and it drove my energy.

568
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:17,352
<i>And at this point,
Toni Kukoc...</i>

569
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:21,397
<i>zero points, zero rebounds
for the Croatian team.</i>

570
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,650
<i>Jordan and Pippen have been all over him.</i>

571
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:27,528
I felt bad for Toni and I thought
Michael and Scottie were out of line.

572
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:28,821
He was terrified.

573
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:31,699
<i>And it's Pippen again.</i>

574
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,368
<i>Here's Pippen...</i>

575
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:37,705
<i>Third foul.
Pippen with a setup from below.</i>

576
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,708
<i>Well, to this point,
it has been all Scottie Pippen.</i>

577
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:45,421
Jerry paved the way
for a lot of hell on Toni Kukoc.

578
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,800
Not only was it just me and Michael,

579
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:53,388
but every guy on that Olympic team
looked at that kid and felt like,

580
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:56,891
"He may not even think about coming
to the NBA after he played against us."

581
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,559
<i>The pressure continues.</i>

582
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:03,523
It wasn't anything personally
about Toni...

583
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:08,277
but we were gonna do everything
that we could to make Jerry look bad.

584
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:10,029
<i>Eighteen off a 19-5 run.</i>

585
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:13,449
<i>Jordan rejected Kukoc.
Here's a three-on-two.</i>

586
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,618
<i>Pippen, all the way!</i>

587
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:19,831
<i>A 33-point victory.</i>

588
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:22,875
<i>Pippen also holding
Toni Kukoc to four points.</i>

589
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:28,172
I know Scottie was a little pissed about
all the publicity surrounding Kukoc,

590
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:32,510
and he proved today that if they gonna
give anybody in Chicago any more money,

591
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:33,720
it better be him.

592
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:37,890
I still hear talk that he just had
a bad game, he was nervous, but...

593
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:42,270
if he's that nervous, then he can't
come to the NBA and play two games.

594
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:43,521
They didn't know me.

595
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:47,191
I don't see a reason...
Why would they try and take it on me?

596
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,693
They don't know me at all.

597
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:51,237
That's the first time we meet.

598
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,240
Scottie says he doesn't
think he could play in the NBA.

599
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:55,323
Do you agree?

600
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,537
Yeah, that's a little bit unfair
and unjust to him. You gotta realize,

601
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:03,124
the guy was playing against 11
of the best players in the league.

602
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,793
Once we were in the finals,
because obviously...

603
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:10,673
the United States is gonna be
the second finalist, then we'll play.

604
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,884
<i>Coming up shortly,
the Dream Team,</i>

605
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:16,596
<i>the US Men's Basketball Team,
will take on Croatia for the gold medal.</i>

606
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:20,767
This is the second meeting
between the United States and Croatia.

607
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:25,563
The last time they met, last week,
the United States won by 33 points.

608
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:27,486
The second game
when we played them,

609
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:29,043
Kukoc came back and I give him credit.

610
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:32,445
He came back and played a much better game
than he did the first game.

611
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:38,326
<i>Toni Kukoc certainly
has turned it around</i>

612
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:42,872
<i>from his performance in the earlier
meeting against the United States.</i>

613
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:47,043
Americans didn't understand
how tough people like Toni Kukoc were.

614
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:47,960
They had no idea.

615
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:51,547
Some people have no idea
about the war-torn situations,

616
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:56,761
and the poverty and the oppression
that guys like Kukoc came from,

617
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:58,805
that produced them, that hardened them.

618
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:00,640
So, it was stupid to call him soft.

619
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:05,103
He had to fight to gain their respect...
and he did it.

620
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,523
To come back after being
totally emasculated,

621
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:10,650
it showed me a lot about Toni Kukoc.

622
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:14,362
<i>Kukoc now has 16 points,
six assists.</i>

623
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:17,073
I remember Michael coming
to the locker room saying,

624
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:19,951
"He played pretty well.
He's tougher than we thought."

625
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:29,961
<i>...117-85 and they have,
as expected, won the gold.</i>

626
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:33,381
The team won the '92 Olympics.

627
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,842
And then, Michael decided

628
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:41,389
that he didn't want to display
the Reebok logo

629
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:43,516
that was on his uniform.

630
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:48,604
<i>Maybe Michael Jordan
did come to the '92 Olympics</i>

631
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:52,066
<i>with an innocent desire
to recapture his pure love of sport,</i>

632
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,861
<i>but money quickly complicated
the sentimental journey.</i>

633
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:58,781
<i>Reebok had spent millions
to outfit the teams in Barcelona</i>

634
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:01,909
<i>and expected all US athletes
to display its logo,</i>

635
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:04,704
<i>especially the high-profile Dream Team.</i>

636
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:10,585
Harvey Schiller. What a dick.

637
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:11,586
Who is that?

638
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:14,714
The guy who said
if we don't wear our uniforms,

639
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:18,467
we can't accept our gold medal
and all that stuff.

640
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,596
Is that still a big issue?
They still talking about that?

641
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:25,224
Nah. They said they are going
to try to hide the Reebok on it.

642
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,643
But they can't hide it
like I'm gonna hide it.

643
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,272
They in for a big fucking surprise.

644
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:37,945
Michael was so singular
in his competitive drive

645
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,740
and the drive that extended
to his partners, like Nike,

646
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:45,828
that he could not bear the thought of
wearing the Reebok logo on a global stage,

647
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:48,289
receiving a gold medal at the Olympics.

648
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:55,838
So he covered the Reebok logo up
with the United States flag.

649
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:59,342
<i>Michael Jordan draped
in the American flag...</i>

650
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:00,593
It was extraordinary.

651
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:03,346
<i>I think that is not solely
for patriotic reasons.</i>

652
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:09,894
Here in Barcelona and the Olympics, these
folks have done a job taking basketball,

653
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:14,190
and Michael Jordan, particularly,
to unbelievable heights.

654
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:16,692
Michael was the face
of the Dream Team,

655
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:21,739
and the Dream Team changed everything
about international basketball.

656
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:25,451
The Dream Team's entirely responsible
for the NBA's profile

657
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:29,080
taking a massive jump forward.

658
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:33,668
It just... It shaped how the world
felt about the NBA.

659
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:36,879
Michael Jordan, the Dream Team,

660
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:42,551
helped bring sports into that place
of cultural influence globally.

661
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:45,763
So it wasn't just music that was cool,

662
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:49,892
it wasn't just fashion in the US
that was translating into other countries.

663
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:52,353
All of a sudden, it was the NBA.

664
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,734
I think it was the first time that
sports was being sold in a cultural way.

665
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,362
We were selling Americana.

666
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:06,951
And then what attached to it was this
incredibly handsome, successful player...

667
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:11,914
his swagger, and people
wanted to be part of that.

668
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:20,506
After the Olympics,
Michael was the most recognizable,

669
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:23,676
the most popular sports figure,

670
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:26,804
but really, cultural figure, in the world.

671
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:29,307
He was really a global superstar.

672
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:32,310
Everyone around the world
knew Michael Jordan.

673
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:40,735
<i>♪ Sometimes I dream ♪</i>

674
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:43,279
<i>♪ That he is me ♪</i>

675
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:47,074
<i>♪ You've got to see
That's how I dream to be ♪</i>

676
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:53,122
Once he got to the point
where it was "Be like Mike"...

677
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:55,583
<i>♪ If I could be like Mike ♪</i>

678
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,543
...that changed everything for him.

679
00:38:58,377 --> 00:38:59,837
There's pressure to be like Mike.

680
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,841
If you're gonna be like him, you've gotta
be clean, you've gotta be Teflon.

681
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:07,470
You've gotta be completely spotless
as a person,

682
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:08,971
and no human being is like that.

683
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,973
<i>- ♪ Be like Mike! ♪
- ♪ Be like Mike! ♪</i>

684
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:13,768
<i>♪ Like Mike, if I could be like Mike ♪</i>

685
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:20,691
Any African-American in this society

686
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,985
that sees significant success

687
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:26,614
has an added burden.

688
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:30,159
And a lot of times,
America's very quick to embrace

689
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:34,372
a Michael Jordan or an Oprah Winfrey
or a Barack Obama, uh...

690
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:40,419
so long as it's understood
that you don't get too controversial

691
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:43,506
around broader issues of social justice.

692
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:45,758
Part of the reason
he remained popular is that

693
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:47,927
he never did anything to piss anybody off.

694
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:51,972
Probably the most controversial thing
Jordan said in his career

695
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:55,184
was when Harvey Gantt
was running for Senate

696
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:57,978
to be the first African-American
from North Carolina

697
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,314
to serve in the US Senate.

698
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:03,734
Michael would not come out
and endorse or support Gantt

699
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:07,738
and, uh, was quoted as saying,
"Republicans buy sneakers, too."

700
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:11,965
<i>Democrats in North Carolina
have nominated Harvey Gantt</i>

701
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:13,577
<i>as their candidate for the Senate.</i>

702
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,788
<i>If he defeats incumbent Jesse Helms,</i>

703
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:18,416
<i>Gantt would become
the state's first black senator.</i>

704
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:22,670
1990 North Carolina Senate race.

705
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:25,673
You have the infamous Jesse Helms

706
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:28,676
and an African-American
by the name of Harvey Gantt.

707
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,429
The stakes are really high.

708
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:35,015
Jesse Helms was a reprehensible figure

709
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,810
in terms of his racism
and conservative politics.

710
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:39,854
Nothing cool about Jesse Helms.

711
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:42,565
<i>Jesse Helms can take
full credit or blame</i>

712
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:45,443
<i>for killing a new National
African-American Museum.</i>

713
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:48,779
Helms also stood against
the Martin Luther King holiday.

714
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:51,907
I'm not saying to you that
we wouldn't have segregated schools,

715
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:54,160
or largely segregated schools,

716
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:58,289
under a Freedom of Choice plan,
such as I've suggested,

717
00:40:58,372 --> 00:41:02,501
but I will say to you that
that would be the choice.

718
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:08,424
Michael refuses to do a commercial
to support Harvey Gantt

719
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:12,720
and the statement that emerges,
"Republicans buy Nikes, too,"

720
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:15,181
sounds as though Michael is saying,

721
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:20,603
"My personal wealth
is more important than my politics

722
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:22,563
as it pertains to the issue of race."

723
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,607
I don't think that statement
needs to be corrected

724
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:30,654
because I said it in jest on a bus
with Horace Grant and Scottie Pippen

725
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:33,073
and it was thrown off the cuff.

726
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:36,619
My mother asked me to do
a PSA for Harvey Gantt.

727
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:40,247
And I said, "Look, Mom, I'm not speaking
out of pocket about someone I don't know,

728
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:44,710
but I will send a contribution
to support him," which is what I did.

729
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:48,589
<i>Conservative incumbent
Jesse Helms won a fourth term,</i>

730
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:51,425
<i>defeating liberal black Harvey Gantt.</i>

731
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:54,595
There is no joy
in Mudville tonight.

732
00:41:57,389 --> 00:41:59,069
<i>Gantt was not bitter in defeat,</i>

733
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:03,145
<i>but this contest proves that race is still
a powerful issue in American politics.</i>

734
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:04,563
Harvey! Harvey!

735
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:08,651
Michael did lose some credibility
with an African-American audience

736
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:13,113
and people were disappointed because
he did not come out and support Gantt.

737
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:16,742
Everybody in the world
respects Muhammad Ali.

738
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:19,537
You know why?
Because he stood for something.

739
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:24,250
He stood for something
even if it meant sacrificing a payday.

740
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,960
We respect that.

741
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:29,964
Ultimately, Michael Jordan
may be forgotten.

742
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:31,799
Muhammad Ali won't be forgotten.

743
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:37,972
I do commend Muhammad Ali
for standing up for what he believed in,

744
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:41,392
but I never thought of myself
as an activist.

745
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:43,686
I thought of myself
as a basketball player.

746
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:50,693
I wasn't a politician when I was playing
my sport. I was focused on my craft.

747
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:52,236
Was that selfish? Probably.

748
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:55,406
But that was my energy,
that's where my energy was.

749
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:57,825
I'll be honest that when...

750
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:03,455
it was reported that Michael said,
"Republicans buy sneakers, too..."

751
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:05,165
Uh...

752
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:08,794
For somebody who was, at that time,

753
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:12,840
preparing for a career in civil rights law
and in public life

754
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:15,426
and knowing what Jesse Helms stood for,

755
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:20,139
you would've wanted to see
Michael push harder on that.

756
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:22,474
On the other hand,

757
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:28,939
he was still trying to figure out,
"How am I... managing this image

758
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:32,693
that has been created around me, um,

759
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:34,361
and how do I live up to it?"

760
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:38,115
It's never gonna be enough for everybody.
I know that, I realize that,

761
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:40,034
'cause everybody has a preconceived idea

762
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:43,203
in terms of what they think I should do
or what I shouldn't do.

763
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:48,459
The way that I go about my life
is I set examples.

764
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:53,672
And if it inspires you, great.
You know, I will continue to do that.

765
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:57,926
If it doesn't, then maybe I'm not
the person that you should be following.

766
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:15,986
In '97 and '98, the ticket
requests went through the roof

767
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:20,157
because there was a question mark,
"Did Michael wanna play or retire?"

768
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:26,538
That year, we put our tickets on sale
on a Saturday morning, at ten o'clock.

769
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:29,416
And people lined up
at the Chicago Stadium.

770
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:33,629
By noon, the entire season was sold out,

771
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:38,926
but then, every request was a battle
for the rest of the season.

772
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:45,099
Michael, on most nights, would need
anywhere from 12 to 20 tickets.

773
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:47,226
Other players would want some.

774
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:50,521
It was funny, too, because at some point,
I had to limit the players.

775
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:53,315
We didn't have unlimited tickets
in those days.

776
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:59,863
Does it matter where they are, man?
Or you want 'em just in the building?

777
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:01,707
They could be in the locker room
next to God.

778
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:04,743
Bam.

779
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:08,956
- Next to who?
- God.

780
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:12,334
You just got one from him.

781
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:14,168
Just kidding.

782
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:17,339
No, he ain't.
No, he ain't, dude. No, he ain't.

783
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:18,549
Hang on, that's a lie.

784
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:20,801
- Do not take that off the tape either.
- You better.

785
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:22,344
- He's not kidding.
- Shit!

786
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:23,470
Lord, I am with you.

787
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:25,764
- I was just kidding.
- He's not kidding.

788
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:27,975
- Don't edit that off.
- Get your ass on outta here.

789
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:29,601
I gave you a ticket, get the hell out.

790
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:32,771
Thank you. Make sure y'all don't
edit that off. He ain't kidding.

791
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:35,649
The road was sometimes
more challenging than at home

792
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:38,819
because you were dealing
in other people's arenas.

793
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:41,697
When he played down at Atlanta,
the Bulls played there,

794
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:44,450
they had more people
than you'd have for a football game

795
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:46,201
in the Atlanta Dome, just to see Michael.

796
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:04,136
<i>NBA record 62,046 fans
packed into the Georgia Dome</i>

797
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:07,973
<i>to see what may have been
Michael Jordan's final game in Atlanta.</i>

798
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:09,767
Right now, if we had another 15,000 seats,

799
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,810
I believe we could still
sell them for this game.

800
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:13,437
It's the hottest thing I've ever seen.

801
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,606
All I know is when the tickets
came in this morning,

802
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:18,192
my wife ran downstairs
and she was crying, she was so happy.

803
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:19,275
So, I'm the hero.

804
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:22,237
<i>Oh!</i>

805
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:25,824
<i>There's nothing you can do about that.
See that's Michael Jordan at his best.</i>

806
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:30,662
Everywhere you went,
people wanted tickets,

807
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:32,706
but it became overwhelming.

808
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:35,125
We gonna see Michael Jordan!

809
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,921
This is what you call a Pope
and Jesus phenomenon.

810
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:44,009
<i>♪ Ah ha, hush that fuss ♪</i>

811
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:46,178

816
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:58,690
We saved a lot of money

817
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:01,777
and we traveled 24 hours
to see Chicago Bulls.

818
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,420
It's a dream!

819
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:05,322
Tonight's game is sold out.

820
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:08,826
Do not purchase tickets
from scalpers on Seventh Avenue.

821
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:10,118
They are counterfeit.

822
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:13,413
And everybody in the world
begged me for tickets.

823
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:17,334
Movie stars would come in
and celebrities would come in.

824
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:18,877
You got to know people.

825
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:20,629
I can beg. I'm a beggar.

826
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:22,673
If there's tickets to be gotten,
I will find 'em.

827
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:25,384
<i>♪ Say ah ha, hush that fuss ♪</i>

828
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:27,636
<i>♪ Everybody move to the back of the bus ♪</i>

829
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:30,180
<i>♪ Do you wanna bump and slump with us? ♪</i>

830
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:32,304
<i>♪ We the type of people
Make the club get crunk... ♪</i>

831
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:35,519
People expect him to still put on a show
and he does that every night.

832
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:38,897
Hey, look, I wanna be like Mike also.

833
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:42,568
What up, fighter?

834
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,780
Michael doesn't pass me the ball.

835
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:49,408
- You heard it here first.
- He doesn't pass me the ball at all.

836
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:51,660
I want Michael to play
as long as he wants.

837
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:52,995
He's at the top of his game.

838
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:55,914
It's a shame what Krause and Reinsdorf
are doing. I don't understand.

839
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:58,333
The similarity between
the Bulls and <i>Seinfeld?</i>

840
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:01,420
The show of the '90s,
the team of the '90s,

841
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:05,173
and I'm trying to make quitting
the move of the '90s.

842
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:06,884
Let the new people in.

843
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:10,345
- Hey, partner. How you doing?
- How you doing?

844
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:12,556
Haven't seen you since the photo shit.

845
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:14,850
These are a couple
of your good fans right here.

846
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:17,412
- Every day we come in to watch the game...
- Nice to meet you.

847
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:18,913
...they're watching your show.

848
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:21,398
Sooner or later,
you gotta get tired of <i>Seinfeld.</i>

849
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:22,733
Let's go, guys.

850
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:25,736
- Hi, Phil.
- How are you doing?

851
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:26,945
All right, have a good game.

852
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:29,281
- Principal's kicking you out.
- Good to see you.

853
00:48:29,364 --> 00:48:30,699
I'll see you, Jerry.

854
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:32,826
All right...

855
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:36,330
This is not gonna work, by the way.
I would get that out of there.

856
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:38,899
- How you doing?
- All right.

857
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:39,875
Have a good game.

858
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:43,629
<i>When you get to the top,
it's great to be admired and respected.</i>

859
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:45,923
<i>I'm not saying that wasn't fun.</i>

860
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:49,134
<i>But every time I would get by myself,</i>

861
00:48:49,217 --> 00:48:52,596
<i>I'd think about the end of the season
and the ultimate goal,</i>

862
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:54,640
<i>holding up that championship trophy</i>

863
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:57,476
<i>and being recognized
as the best team in the world.</i>

864
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:00,771
<i>It's something at the end
of this rainbow that I'm fighting for</i>

865
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:03,440
<i>and I'm going to give
every little bit to get to it.</i>
