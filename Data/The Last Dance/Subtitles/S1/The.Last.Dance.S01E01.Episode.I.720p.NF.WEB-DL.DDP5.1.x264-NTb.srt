1
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:36,077
<i>Thank you.</i>

2
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,080
To all the fans in the city of Chicago,

3
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:43,585
if you guys remember in 1984
when they drafted Michael Jordan...

4
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,715
<i>I said then, when I got here,</i>

5
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:50,638
<i>that we would be champions
by the time I leave.</i>

6
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,470
- Here they are.
- This is what you're looking for.

7
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:58,349
<i>Well, we are five-time champions,
going for six,</i>

8
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:02,103
<i>and we need your support.
Thank you very, very much.</i>

9
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:31,953
<i>You have any sense of destiny,
you know, why is all this meant for you,</i>

10
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:35,095
<i>and what's down the road,
or are you just taking it a day at a time?</i>

11
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:39,307
I just want the franchise and
Chicago Bulls to be respected as a team...

12
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:44,187
like the Lakers or Philadelphia 76ers
or the Boston Celtics.

13
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:49,067
It's very hard for something like that
to happen, but it's not impossible.

14
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,778
But hopefully, I, and this team

15
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:54,739
and this whole organization
can build a program like that.

16
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,997
<i>Michael Jordan...
with 30 points.</i>

17
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:09,587
<i>And the Chicago Bulls have won
their first-ever NBA championship.</i>

18
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,391
<i>There's Jordan for three!</i>

19
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,062
<i>They have done it again!</i>

20
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,690
<i>Now, Pippen gets a snatch.</i>

21
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,277
<i>There's Paxson for three! Yes!</i>

22
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,072
<i>For three straight NBA championships.</i>

23
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:39,951
<i>Debate will now rage about
whether they are the best team ever.</i>

24
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:44,372
<i>They're not just great athletes. They're
a fascinating assortment of personalities.</i>

25
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:47,750
The most famous man on the planet is here!

26
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:54,340
My name is Michael Jordan.
I played with the Bulls from '84 to '98.

27
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:58,052
Took an 18-month vacation, hiatus.

28
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:02,015
So I would say that 13 years
that I played with the Bulls.

29
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,146
Please welcome from the Chicago Bulls,
all-star forward Scottie Pippen!

30
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:14,777
Scottie Maurice Pippen
from Hamburg, Arkansas.

31
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,864
<i>Great passing! Oh!</i>

32
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:22,160
<i>Baby! It looked like
he shifted gears mid-air.</i>

33
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:27,373
He has led the NBA in rebounds
for the last five years.

34
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,667
Please welcome back Dennis Rodman.

35
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,920
Dennis Rodman. What's up?

36
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:36,382
I was shocked the Chicago Bulls
even asked me to come.

37
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,384
I think
I was a little more eccentric for them.

38
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,637
<i>There's something about you
that's frightening.</i>

39
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,840
Is it because I'm different?

40
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:46,017
<i>And Rodman just kicked the
photographer! The photographer is hurt.</i>

41
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,811
<i>That is the last
we will see of Dennis Rodman.</i>

42
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:54,359
At the heart of this team
is a rare spirit, coach Phil Jackson.

43
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,946
We created an image
that people wanted to be part of.

44
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,530
I think that's all you can hope for.

45
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,284
<i>The Chicago Bulls have won</i>

46
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:07,330
<i>the '96 NBA championship!</i>

47
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,874
<i>What's unique
about this particular dynasty?</i>

48
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:12,418
I guess what's unique is that,
we're, uh...

49
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:15,213
You know, we've got Michael.

50
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:22,220
Michael! Michael!
Michael! Michael!

51
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,500
Why is everybody here?

52
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:27,058
- Michael Jordan.
- Michael Jordan.

53
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:29,352
Everybody loves Chicago Bulls
and Michael Jordan.

54
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:39,237
<i>...was about to do.</i>

55
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,074
<i>Five seconds remaining in regulation.
The inbound...</i>

56
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,577
<i>Pippen rolls it to Kukoc!</i>

57
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:51,791
<i>Chicago Bulls have won
their fifth championship</i>

58
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:53,668
<i>in the last seven years!</i>

59
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:57,588
<i>It is bedlam here at the United Center.</i>

60
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,261
<i>To hometown Chicago fans,</i>

61
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:06,639
<i>winning the big one is starting to feel
almost like a constitutional right</i>

62
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:10,310
<i>as the Bulls took
their fifth NBA title on Friday night.</i>

63
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:16,441
<i>Count them. One, two, three,
four and five NBA championship trophies.</i>

64
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:19,110
<i>As hundreds of thousands
of fans cheered the Bulls,</i>

65
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:20,653
<i>the drama of what will happen</i>

66
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,406
<i>to this great dynasty
was apparent to all...</i>

67
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,451
After the fifth championship,
which was '96-'97,

68
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:32,123
we were looking at this team
and we realized, other than Michael,

69
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:36,878
the rest of the guys were probably
at the end of their high-productive years.

70
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,257
We had to decide
whether we keep the team together or not,

71
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,677
and we realized
maybe this was the time to do a rebuild

72
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,387
and not try to win a sixth championship.

73
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:47,990
<i>Can they
keep the team together?</i>

74
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,450
<i>Is there any doubt Michael...</i>

75
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,851
<i>Questions about
the future of Phil Jackson.</i>

76
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:53,811
<i>Will this be his last year?</i>

77
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:56,332
<i>How will the Bulls
deal with their aging stars...</i>

78
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:59,650
<i>...becoming something
transcendent, you can see it evaporating.</i>

79
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:07,200
I just kept hearing this over and over,
and I was just getting irritated, like...

80
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:08,785
We were winning.

81
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:14,457
We felt like
we were the greatest team ever.

82
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,501
<i>You have to wonder
why Michael Jordan,</i>

83
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:20,713
<i>who is surely the most popular player
in our time, would be, in effect,</i>

84
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,590
<i>driven out of professional basketball.</i>

85
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,476
<i>A spectacular move!</i>

86
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,186
<i>The game's over!</i>

87
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,563
<i>Chicago Stadium is going wild!</i>

88
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:42,026
<i>First of all, there's
no backstabbing going on here.</i>

89
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,068
<i>It's time for me to move on.</i>

90
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,469
<i>This will be Phil's last year
as coach of the Bulls.</i>

91
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,636
- <i>Are the expectations too high?
- Where do we go from here?</i>

92
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,162
<i>The only question:
how long can it last?</i>

93
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:11,013
So, going into 1997-98,
the Bulls have won five championships.

94
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,266
There's drama that summer

95
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:16,602
as to whether they're gonna come back,
although I think most of us

96
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:20,606
who are from Chicago and call Chicago home
knew somehow they'd be back.

97
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,944
Jerry Reinsdorf, the majority owner...

98
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:28,239
would have to leave town
if they didn't come back.

99
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:31,951
You can't argue with championship
after championship after championship.

100
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,037
They were still the best team in the NBA.

101
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:39,500
You have Scottie Pippen,
an incredibly talented athlete,

102
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:40,960
very skilled scorer.

103
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:44,172
His mental sharpness
and his court awareness

104
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:47,592
and his basketball savvy made him
the greatest number-two player ever.

105
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:52,972
Dennis Rodman was the defensive presence,
the rebounder,

106
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:56,309
someone who, on a team with big egos,
didn't need the ball.

107
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,270
And he never ran out of energy,
that was the thing.

108
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:00,897
Whoo!

109
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:05,818
At that point, Michael Jordan's
already the ultimate sports alpha male.

110
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:10,114
I mean, the only comparisons
that I can recall being apt

111
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:13,326
were to Babe Ruth and Muhammad Ali.

112
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,662
That's it. That's the list.
There's nobody else on it.

113
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:18,664
Michael, obviously,

114
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:21,626
in the wake of this
incredible celebration,

115
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:24,504
there'll be some
very difficult business decisions.

116
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:29,133
We are entitled to defend what we have
until we lose it.

117
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,762
If we lose it, then you look at it
and say, "Okay, let's change.

118
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,556
Let's just go through a rebuilding."

119
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:40,311
No one's guaranteeing rebuilding's
gonna be two or three, four, five years.

120
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:43,231
Cubs have been rebuilding for 42 years.

121
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,029
If you wanna look at this
from a business thing,

122
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:54,408
have a sense of respect for the people
who have laid the groundworks

123
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:57,036
so that you could be
a profitable organization.

124
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,331
<i>We had just finished
winning a fifth title.</i>

125
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:49,839
<i>It's a lot of uncertainty,
and management started talking about</i>

126
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:53,134
<i>the franchise is gonna change
or we're gonna rebuild.</i>

127
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,303
<i>I thought it was unfair.</i>

128
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:00,891
<i>I would never let someone
who's not putting on a uniform</i>

129
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:05,896
<i>and playing each and every day dictate
what we do on the basketball court.</i>

130
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:12,778
<i>So, you know, my mentality was,
"Let's put things aside,</i>

131
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,781
<i>you know, from a business sense
and focus on that craft.</i>

132
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,534
<i>Let's give them a reason
not to think that way."</i>

133
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:25,166
<i>Michael Jordan waded into
the undertone of bitterness on the Bulls</i>

134
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:28,294
<i>when asked what the Bulls'
biggest challenge would be this year.</i>

135
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,797
Um...

136
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:35,468
<i>Michael glancing up
at the office of GM Jerry Krause.</i>

137
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:42,391
Jerry Krause was the
general manager of the Bulls,

138
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,853
and he was certainly at the root of

139
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:49,231
what made the tension
of that season so severe.

140
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,738
Jerry Krause was a scout
for the White Sox.

141
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,491
He was there
when I bought the White Sox in 1981.

142
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,827
And after I bought the Bulls,
he came to see me.

143
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,372
<i>Said he'd like to be
general manager of the Bulls.</i>

144
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,791
If everybody's ready, we can get started.

145
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:08,394
<i>I asked around the league,</i>

146
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:11,003
<i>and everybody I talked to said,
"Don't touch the guy."</i>

147
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,422
Yeah, he had a way of alienating people.

148
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,760
But I wasn't hiring somebody
to win a personality contest.

149
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:21,097
I wanted somebody who
truly believed in building a team

150
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,432
the way I wanted to,
and Krause was the guy.

151
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:27,895
To his credit, he did his job.

152
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:29,979
But...

153
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,066
Jerry had the "little man" problem.

154
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,944
He grew up a little fat kid.

155
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,488
Not a lot of money.
He was always the underdog,

156
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:42,076
and he just couldn't control
that part of him that needed...

157
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:43,911
credit.

158
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:45,787
Michael!

159
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,258
All the attention
is going to Michael

160
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,627
and Scottie and Dennis and Phil.

161
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,797
And Krause was growing resentful
about this.

162
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,718
He was good,
but he wasn't good enough

163
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,428
to do it without Michael Jordan.

164
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,847
You could argue that Michael Jordan
was as good at his job

165
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,808
as anyone has ever been at their job,
ever, in anything.

166
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,185
And Krause wants to make the point,

167
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:11,063
organizations win championships,
not players.

168
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:16,527
Jerry Krause, Bulls general manager, says,
"Organizations win titles, not players."

169
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,780
Funny thing, I've never seen him post up
and hit a short jump shot.

170
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:22,491
This quote
that was attributed to you...

171
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,660
Well, as you know, David,
it was a misquote.

172
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:28,914
What I said was that players and coaches
alone don't win championships,

173
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,040
that organizations do.

174
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:33,169
I do sincerely believe that organizations,
as a whole, win.

175
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,254
One part of it can't win alone.

176
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,465
The guy left the word "alone"
out of there.

177
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,359
Right.

178
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:41,469
He admitted it later on.
"Yeah, I left a word out."

179
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:44,305
You dumb son of a bitch,
that's what killed the quote.

180
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:48,768
It sounded like he was making
a very specific point

181
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,519
to a very specific person.

182
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:54,190
We know that the team is much bigger
than the 15 players.

183
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:58,486
Those guys who work in the front office,
they were good people,

184
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:03,949
but the most important part
of the process is the players.

185
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:09,205
So, for him to say that is offensive
to the way that I approach the game.

186
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:14,960
<i>Krause was picked on an awful lot
during this by Michael and Scottie.</i>

187
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:18,297
I mean, they made fun of him.
They mocked him. They mocked him openly.

188
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:21,008
So those are the pills you take
to keep you short.

189
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,511
Or are those diet pills?

190
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,599
Was Jerry Krause a bad guy? No.

191
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,976
He was a good guy. He was fun.

192
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:35,064
If you saw him interact with your kids,
and saw him, you knew he was a good man.

193
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:40,194
Jerry Krause was one of the nicest,
kindest, sweetest men I've ever known.

194
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:45,407
But sometimes, he would love people
who really didn't love him back,

195
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,909
and it would disappoint him.

196
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,661
Did he love Phil?

197
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,205
Well, he loved Phil in the beginning,

198
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:55,459
but then, you know, they developed
a tension between the two of 'em.

199
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:56,543
Phil,

200
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:59,171
from a contract standpoint,

201
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,048
wanted to be compensated,

202
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:06,554
like the other coaches that he had beaten,
and Jerry wasn't going to do that.

203
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:09,431
In Jerry's mind,
you moved pieces in and out.

204
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,141
You didn't move Michael Jordan pieces.

205
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:15,229
Phil Jackson? You can move him in and out.
And he was wrong about that.

206
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,191
I said from day one,

207
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:22,361
if Phil's not coaching,
I'm not gonna be a part of rebuilding.

208
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:26,156
Phil should be the head coach,
and I shouldn't be put in a position

209
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,369
to have to make a choice to play
for another coach other than Phil Jackson.

210
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:32,705
Sadly as it may be, I have choices.

211
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:36,625
You know, and I will not choose to play
for another coach.

212
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:42,256
I think Jerry was looking forward
to having a clean slate

213
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:44,592
and going out and, you know, rebuilding.

214
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:49,054
His relationship with me
had become such a circus.

215
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,182
There was no chance for reconciliation.

216
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:56,437
All of a sudden, there's this guy from
Iowa State, Tim Floyd, the head coach.

217
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:59,857
He goes fishing with Jerry Krause,
and I'm like, "What?"

218
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:04,528
So, Krause clearly
is grooming the next guy.

219
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:08,240
He's gonna be the next Phil Jackson.

220
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:11,493
Krause's stepdaughter
gets married that summer.

221
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:16,373
He invites everybody from the team
and Tim Floyd...

222
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:20,794
and he doesn't invite Phil Jackson,
the head coach.

223
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:24,590
I recall that, and I think
that was bad form on Jerry's part.

224
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:26,342
I'm not sure it bothered Phil that much.

225
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:29,553
If somebody doesn't invite me
to a wedding, I'd like to thank 'em.

226
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,891
It was sad that there was
such an acrimonious relationship

227
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:37,353
because Jerry Krause started
Phil Jackson's NBA coaching career.

228
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:42,024
Jerry Krause brought him to Chicago
as an assistant coach.

229
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,694
If that hadn't happened, you never
would have heard of Phil Jackson.

230
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:50,157
You know,
things evolve, people evolve.

231
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,035
They don't stay stagnant
and static in any position.

232
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:56,705
And more than anything else,
coaches' salaries went like this

233
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,500
and general managers' salaries
might have gone like this.

234
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,710
Do you think
Jerry Krause resents that?

235
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,338
I'm not gonna speculate on that.

236
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:09,218
I have tremendous regard for Phil,
personally and professionally.

237
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,512
I really like Phil Jackson,

238
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:14,515
and I wanted Phil Jackson to come back
and coach the team.

239
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:18,769
And I just thought that the presence
of Jerry was counterproductive.

240
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:22,147
I just thought if Phil and I
would sit down and talk, we'd work it out.

241
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,524
And I flew out to Montana.

242
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,943
I offered him the opportunity
to come back.

243
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,778
After weeks of public debate,

244
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:31,782
many would argue that Bulls owner
Jerry Reinsdorf has come to his senses,

245
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:36,245
signing Phil Jackson to a one-year deal
to return as coach next season.

246
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:39,999
Phil is the coach, Jerry's the owner.
Those two needed to talk.

247
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:43,043
And we got it done,
and we're very happy to have it done.

248
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,713
This will be Phil's last year
as the coach of the Bulls.

249
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:48,590
At the conclusion of the year,
we'll look towards the future.

250
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:52,761
Jerry called me to his office and said,
"This is going to be your last year.

251
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:56,223
I don't care if you win 82 games in a row,
this will be your last year here."

252
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:59,101
So, I said, "Fine,"
and I walked out of the room.

253
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:02,062
And that was the only words
that were exchanged.

254
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:33,469
Michael... Hello, Michael.

255
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:40,350
- How much French do you know?
- Very little. But that's okay, I get by.

256
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,528
Michael, what do you think
about the Eiffel Tower?

257
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:56,200
<i>The Bulls were coming off
this glorious season.</i>

258
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:59,161
<i>They had a three-peat
and they won two more.</i>

259
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,955
And there they are in Paris,
where they were mobbed.

260
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,542
<i>I mean, it was like
The Beatles had come to town.</i>

261
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:08,003
- Come on.
- Don't stop. Let's go.

262
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,546
Quick step, quick step.

263
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:16,553
Michael was like the Pied Piper
walking down the Champs-Élysées.

264
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,223
I think he was wearing a beret,
because he's Michael.

265
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,767
How do you feel, Michael?

266
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:24,103
How do you feel?

267
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:25,872
<i>The NBA champions,
Chicago Bulls,</i>

268
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:28,065
<i>were in Paris for McDonald's Championship.</i>

269
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:31,151
<i>Just one man is hogging
the attention, Michael Jordan.</i>

270
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:34,446
<i>"He's bigger than the Pope,"
screams the morning paper,</i>

271
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,115
<i>and everybody wants a piece of him.</i>

272
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,951
- Uh, that's fine. Yeah.
- Pocket?

273
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,452
And for the translation.

274
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,287
- Right here is fine?
- Right. Yes.

275
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,206
Will you mind signing this, please?

276
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,792
No, no. Not now, not now.

277
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:54,973
You don't
have to be a connoisseur

278
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,511
to know the greatest basketball player
of all time.

279
00:18:57,594 --> 00:19:01,348
The person who is the closest
to a god on Earth,

280
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:03,642
Michael "Air" Jordan! Please!

281
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:06,562
Michael! Michael!

282
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:10,149
Michael Jordan!

283
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:14,611
Michael Jordan!

284
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:19,616
<i>You couldn't make
a shortlist</i>

285
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:24,538
<i>of the most consequential
and successful teams in American sports,</i>

286
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:27,583
<i>and leave Michael Jordan
and the '90s Bulls out.</i>

287
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:31,628
But the Bulls who immediately preceded
the Michael Jordan era

288
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:34,381
could be characterized as mediocre.

289
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:45,475
Hi, I'm Bob Costas.
Join me and Johnny Kerr

290
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:51,231
for exciting Chicago Bulls basketball
action here on WGN Television, channel 9.

291
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:56,528
We weren't very good, uh,
during the time leading up to Michael.

292
00:19:56,612 --> 00:20:00,991
The team was, you know,
on a downward keel, if you will.

293
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:04,035
<i>They've obviously got
some problems.</i>

294
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,913
<i>The ball club has not been winning.</i>

295
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,876
Back then, in Chicago,
everyone was a Bears fan.

296
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:16,006
Northsiders were Cubs fans.
Southsiders were Sox fans.

297
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:19,259
Blackhawks had fans scattered throughout,

298
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,012
but there was no buzz about the Bulls.

299
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:25,074
The Bulls were being outdrawn
at the Chicago Stadium

300
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:28,310
by an indoor soccer team,
the Chicago Sting.

301
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:31,396
Basically, the state of the team was...

302
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,233
It was Rodney Dangerfield,
it didn't get no respect.

303
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,818
The Bulls were in need
of a lot of reinforcements

304
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,502
if they were gonna be a contending team.

305
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:45,244
And here comes a young Michael Jordan,
brimming with charismatic talent.

306
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:47,764
When he was in high school,

307
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:50,832
Michael was one of the top recruited
high school players in America.

308
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,627
He decided to play at Chapel Hill

309
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,963
for one of the great coaches
of all time, Dean Smith.

310
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:01,760
At the University of North Carolina,
Coach Smith ran a very tight ship.

311
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:06,431
He was a disciplinarian.
A tremendous teacher.

312
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,308
Michael had a ton of respect for him

313
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,519
and he knew he had
the best interest for Michael.

314
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:13,105
I think Mr. Jordan's vision and my vision,

315
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:16,942
who is going to help him continue to grow
as a young adult,

316
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:20,153
not just basketball, but his education.

317
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:22,781
Because for me, then,
the first priority was education.

318
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,333
Penetrate. Look at the basket. That's it.

319
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,878
Michael's parents
did a tremendous job with him.

320
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,798
He was a fine young man.

321
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:42,217
A very conscientious student,
a very good student.

322
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:46,888
This is your mom
reading aloud a letter home from you.

323
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:54,313
"Dear Mom. How has life been treating you?
Fine, I hope. I am doing just fine.

324
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,940
<i>I am sending you
my account number</i>

325
00:21:57,024 --> 00:22:00,569
<i>so that you can deposit some money
in my account.</i>

326
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,654
<i>I have only $20 left.</i>

327
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:06,450
<i>Tell everyone I said hello and smile.</i>

328
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,952
<i>God and I love you.
Love, Michael.</i>

329
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:13,915
P.S. Sorry about the phone bill.
Please also send me some stamps."

330
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:20,839
Is that not a college student?
"Please send me some stamps."

331
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,761
<i>He was very inconsistent
as a freshman,</i>

332
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:29,348
<i>but he's one of the most competitive ones
we've ever had in our drills.</i>

333
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:32,851
<i>He wanted to get better,
and then he had the ability to get better.</i>

334
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:38,523
Michael Jordan told me he wants
to be the best player to ever play here.

335
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:41,985
I said, "You gotta work harder
than you did in high school."

336
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:45,197
He said, "I worked as hard as everybody."
I said, "Excuse me.

337
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,075
I thought you wanted to be
the best player to ever play here."

338
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:51,578
He said, "I'm gonna show you.
Nobody will ever work as hard as I work."

339
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:58,877
After about two and a half hours
of hard practice,

340
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,838
I'm walking off the floor,
drenched sweat, tired,

341
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:04,591
and here comes Michael,
pushing me back on the floor,

342
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:08,220
wanting to play a little one-on-one,
wanting to see where his game was.

343
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:10,722
I was better than he was

344
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,058
for about two weeks.

345
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,268
<i>Watch out!</i>

346
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:20,315
<i>He wanted to learn,
he wanted to grow quickly.</i>

347
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,067
<i>He's on a tear right now...</i>

348
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,920
<i>From month to month,
from game to game,</i>

349
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,821
<i>he was soaking up information.</i>

350
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:31,910
<i>Once he got something and added it
to the raw talent that he already had,</i>

351
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:34,079
<i>it was really explosive to see.</i>

352
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:41,878
<i>And by the time we got to
the national championship game,</i>

353
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,839
<i>he was a great player.</i>

354
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:48,760
<i>Forty-fourth NCAA
Division One</i>

355
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,470
<i>Men's Basketball Championship.</i>

356
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:53,974
<i>The largest crowd ever
for a basketball game,</i>

357
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:56,143
<i>an electric atmosphere.</i>

358
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,938
We were getting out there
in front of 60-some thousand people.

359
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:04,025
I was young, but I had no time
to be nervous.

360
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:08,488
You had two great teams going
against each other, who were well coached.

361
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:11,241
Both teams were equally matched.

362
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:18,957
Michael had some big key buckets
and had some big shots.

363
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,334
<i>Jordan on the... Oh!
What a lay-up!</i>

364
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:24,337
<i>He put that ball up about 12 feet!</i>

365
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:27,257
It was about as tightly contested a game

366
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,259
as you could ever want to see.

367
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:32,304
And then, for the ending
to be the way that it was,

368
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:35,223
was rather amazing, as well.

369
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:39,311
<i>Thirty-two seconds to go.
A one-point lead for Georgetown.</i>

370
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:42,230
<i>Dean Smith has said that's timeout.</i>

371
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:45,734
Coach Smith called that timeout.
We're down one.

372
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:49,696
This was where Coach Smith
was extremely cool.

373
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:53,575
He was drawing up
a play for James.

374
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:57,621
And he says that, "When you get the ball,
swing it back, swing it around.

375
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:59,122
Michael should have a shot."

376
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:02,268
He looked at me and said,
"If you get the shot, take the shot."

377
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,960
He gave me the green light.

378
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:08,673
<i>Thirty-two seconds to go.
A one-point lead for Georgetown.</i>

379
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:11,384
<i>They stay in the one-three-one,
with Ewing in the middle.</i>

380
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:13,011
<i>They've gotta look to get it in there.</i>

381
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:15,198
They knew they'd be
focusing on the internal.

382
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:17,599
That's where the defense was collapsing.

383
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:21,811
Our offense shifted to one side.
The whole defense went that way.

384
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:23,855
And Michael was on the left side,

385
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:27,025
- the ball was reversed...
- And Michael's wide open.

386
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,945
I caught it in total rhythm.

387
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:33,198
They had no clue
that I was gonna take that shot.

388
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,242
<i>...shot. Jordan!</i>

389
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:39,079
<i>Three! It's over! It's over!</i>

390
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:44,417
<i>North Carolina has won
the 1982 NCAA Championship.</i>

391
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:53,510
And the man who hit
the crucial shot down the stretch

392
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:56,805
for North Carolina, Michael Jordan.
Those points proved to be the game winner.

393
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:59,516
Michael, how did it feel
when the ball dropped through the net?

394
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:03,562
It felt really good, that I did something
to help out the whole team

395
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:08,358
and maybe win the game, and I just felt
very excited at the time.

396
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:12,112
That turned my name from Mike
to Michael Jordan.

397
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:14,906
It gave me the confidence that I needed

398
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,367
to start to excel
at the game of basketball.

399
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:27,335
I'm just a freshman on the block,
and I enjoyed my freshman year.

400
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:36,303
And I hope in the next three years
that I'm here

401
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:38,597
that we can win
at least two or three more.

402
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:43,768
What Michael really did
was improve considerably

403
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:46,521
between his freshman and sophomore year.

404
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,541
<i>North Carolina turns it over.</i>

405
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:50,108
<i>Dawkins trying to run past Braddock.</i>

406
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:52,777
<i>Look at Michael Jordan cover ground!</i>

407
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:55,155
<i>I think he hit his head on the backboard.</i>

408
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:58,199
<i>I heard a little bang. And that's how high
that young man got up,</i>

409
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,784
<i>he hit the back of his head...</i>

410
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:04,039
I can't pick one moment. When I think of
Michael Jordan, yes, I think of the shot,

411
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:07,375
but I think of three years
of watching that youngster

412
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,628
get better and better and better.

413
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:13,173
Michael Jordan's the only player
that could ever turn it on and off,

414
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,550
and he never frickin' turned it off.

415
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:20,096
<i>Jordan...
Look at that! Holy cow!</i>

416
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:29,230
<i>But after junior year,
I was planning on coming back to school...</i>

417
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:30,814
What's up?

418
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,024
<i>What's up?</i>

419
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:35,570
<i>...but Coach Smith
recommended I go pro.</i>

420
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:39,032
He was very comfortable
in Chapel Hill.

421
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,202
But at the same time, he was hearing,

422
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,829
"You could be one of the top three
or four picks."

423
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:47,624
So, it was weighing heavy on him.

424
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:54,923
Well, to tell you the truth,
I really just decided,

425
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:57,801
uh, I guess, an hour and a half ago.

426
00:27:57,884 --> 00:28:00,512
I didn't know, I was, you know, 50-50,

427
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:03,765
and I talked to Coach
this morning and, you know,

428
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,767
he helped me and my parents helped me,

429
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:11,773
and I felt that would be better for me
to start now, while I'm young.

430
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:21,408
<i>The USA Network presents
the 1984 NBA college draft.</i>

431
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:24,994
<i>We are just about ready to go,
as we go to the podium</i>

432
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:28,540
<i>and introduce commissioner
of the NBA David Stern.</i>

433
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,543
The Houston Rockets select

434
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:36,131
Hakeem Olajuwon
of the University of Houston.

435
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:42,512
Olajuwon would have been first
by anybody who picked, including me.

436
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:46,224
<i>- </i>Portland had Clyde Drexler...
<i>- Clyde the Glide!</i>

437
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:48,727
...who played the same position
as Michael.

438
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:53,314
So, Portland's feeling was that
they needed a center.

439
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:56,210
<i>Now, the second choice,
owned by the Portland Trail Blazers.</i>

440
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,278
<i>Let's go to the commissioner, David Stern.</i>

441
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:02,824
Portland selects Sam Bowie,
University of Kentucky.

442
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:08,079
So, I knew that, you know,
Jordan would be there for us.

443
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:11,249
<i>Michael Jordan seems to be
the next one up.</i>

444
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,543
The Chicago Bulls

445
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:19,007
pick Michael Jordan
of the University of North Carolina.

446
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:22,093
<i>The Chicago Bulls,
having the third pick in the draft,</i>

447
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:25,972
<i>and went with the sensational
Michael Jordan of North Carolina.</i>

448
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:30,185
<i>Jordan, who led North Carolina,
now looking to step in to lead the Bulls.</i>

449
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,395
You've got a great opportunity
to step in

450
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:34,522
and win a city
that is crying for a winner.

451
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,983
Perhaps you can turn
that Bulls thing around.

452
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:40,528
Hopefully, I can go in and contribute
and maybe turn it around.

453
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:42,864
I'm looking forward to that.

454
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:51,706
The reality is we were lucky the draft
was before the Olympics.

455
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:57,962
Michael became the most popular
amateur basketball player in the world

456
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,422
because of the Olympics.

457
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:02,175
<i>Jordan gets it,
puts it in the hole.</i>

458
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:03,802
<i>Jordan...</i>

459
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:05,594
<i>Jordan...</i>

460
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,990
He's the best athlete,
one of the best competitors.

461
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:09,599
He's one of the most skilled players

462
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:13,812
and that makes him the best basketball
player that I've ever seen play.

463
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:18,858
<i>US has its ninth gold medal,</i>

464
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:23,196
<i>but it's been an all-USA show
in this tournament.</i>

465
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:32,956
I came from a program in college.

466
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:36,459
It was about team game.
You know, it was a clean program.

467
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,838
It prepared me to go
into the Chicago situation,

468
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:41,422
which was totally different.

469
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:48,471
<i>Before Michael Jordan got to the
Bulls in 1984, drugs were prevalent.</i>

470
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:51,724
<i>Cocaine and recreational drugs
of all types.</i>

471
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:53,893
<i>So, they had a lot of partiers.</i>

472
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,771
One of the articles I read,
they called it

473
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,773
"The Bulls' traveling cocaine circus."

474
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:07,866
I've never read that article.

475
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:13,788
- Accurate?
- Uh... Look...

476
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:17,292
Guys were doing things that I didn't see.

477
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:21,880
I had one event, preseason.
I think we were in Peoria.

478
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:24,424
It was in a hotel
so I'm trying to find my teammates.

479
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:26,467
So I start knocking on doors.

480
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:29,596
I get to this one door,
and I knock on the door,

481
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:32,348
and I can hear someone says, "Shh.

482
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:34,642
Someone's outside."

483
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:40,231
And then you hear this deep voice,
says, "Who is it?" I says, "MJ."

484
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,692
And then they all say,
"Oh, fuck, he's just a rookie.

485
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:45,069
Don't worry about it."
So they open up the door.

486
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:49,490
I walk in, and practically
the whole team was in there.

487
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:54,162
And it was like,
things I've never seen in my life,

488
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:56,289
you know, as a young kid.

489
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:59,167
You got all...
You got your lines over here.

490
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,170
You got your weed smokers over here.
You got your women over here.

491
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,175
So the first thing I said,
"Look, man, you know, I'm out,"

492
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:10,553
because all I can think about,
if they come and raid this place,

493
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:15,975
right about now, I am just as guilty
as everybody else that's in this room.

494
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:19,520
And from that point on,
I was more or less on my own.

495
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:23,733
His townhouse
was just a regular place.

496
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:26,277
And at the start,
his mom would be there an awful lot.

497
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:29,238
And Jordan's buddies would come by,

498
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:33,451
players and what have you, but he was
just living like he was still in college.

499
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:37,413
<i>I enjoyed, you know,
just hanging out, playing cards,</i>

500
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:40,500
<i>watching movies, you know,
I wouldn't go into the clubs.</i>

501
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:44,045
Whatever somebody else
might've been doing off the court,

502
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:48,508
if it was partying or whatever,
that wasn't part of what he wanted to do.

503
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:50,843
Orange juice and 7-Up was his go-to.

504
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:56,641
I don't smoke, I don't do lines.
I didn't drink at the time.

505
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:59,811
I was looking just to get some rest,
get up and go play.

506
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:04,565
When Jordan first came to the Bulls,
he was the number-three pick

507
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:08,903
so a lot of people thought, "Well, he's
only 6'6". So how much can he really do?"

508
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:13,074
We wish he were 7'1", but he isn't.

509
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:15,284
Michael gotta realize he's not seven foot,

510
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:17,787
so he's not gonna carry a team in the NBA.

511
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:20,999
I really don't think that, uh,

512
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:24,544
in the NBA anymore, there's really not
any such thing as a one-man team.

513
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:27,588
And I don't think that you can
come in expecting one guy

514
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,048
to turn the whole thing around.

515
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:34,721
There was no one alive, not Coach Smith,
not Rod Thorn, who drafted him,

516
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:39,225
no one, none of the experts, thought
that he would become what he became.

517
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,437
When I first got to Chicago,

518
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,440
I went in considering myself
the lowest on the totem pole.

519
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:48,985
Whatever people had been saying about me,
I still had to earn my stripes.

520
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:54,657
When he arrived into the gym
on the first day of practice,

521
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:57,952
you can see that this guy
is the best player here.

522
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,955
This cat is different.

523
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:05,793
When we drafted Michael,
I did not know how good Michael was.

524
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:09,213
The strength he had,
the physical strength, was amazing.

525
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,719
The first day of practice,

526
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:19,557
I got a call from the assistant coach,
and he said to me,

527
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,894
"Congratulations," and I said, "For what?"

528
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:26,814
And he said,
"You did not screw this draft up.

529
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,108
This guy is really good."

530
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:33,780
From the first day in practice,
my mentality was

531
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:35,907
whoever is the team leader on that team,

532
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,492
I'm going after him

533
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:40,787
and I'm not gonna do it with my voice
because I had no voice.

534
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,914
I had no...
I had no status.

535
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:45,263
I have to do it with the way that I play.

536
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:47,001
<i>Twenty-three, Michael Jordan!</i>

537
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,378
I felt like I earned my stripes
in the third game.

538
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:55,510
Milwaukee's always been
a nemesis for Chicago.

539
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:58,554
Every time we played 'em, they beat us.

540
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:04,310
They had Sidney Moncrief, who was
the reigning defensive player of the year,

541
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:06,395
and they had a tremendous defensive team.

542
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:08,898
I kind of thought I knew his potential

543
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:12,318
because I had played against
the best players in the NBA so far.

544
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:15,905
The Magics and the Birds and the Dr. J
and Kareem. There were some great players.

545
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:19,784
Then all of a sudden,
this rookie comes into the NBA,

546
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,912
and I watched the way he moved
on the court and his instincts,

547
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:25,248
I'm like, "Wow. That's going to be scary."

548
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:27,959
<i>Milwaukee Bucks
have taken control here,</i>

549
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:29,627
<i>and they have a nine-point lead.</i>

550
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:32,255
We were losing,
going into the fourth quarter.

551
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:36,300
Before, guys would get down on themselves
and then they just kind of give up.

552
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:39,595
"Okay, we just chalk this up.
We look for the next game."

553
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:41,722
I'm saying, "The game's not over with."

554
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,809
And Kevin Loughery sensed that in me,

555
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:47,812
and he just started feeding me the ball,
and I just started going.

556
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:50,207
<i>Jordan now has 24
and is keeping the Bulls in it.</i>

557
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:51,816
<i>Jordan goes for it! Gets it!</i>

558
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:54,527
<i>There's Jordan driving...</i>

559
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:57,155
<i>Whoa! Unbelievable!</i>

560
00:35:57,238 --> 00:36:01,701
Every time we went to trap him,
he would split, go down the lane,

561
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:03,327
make a really difficult shot.

562
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,246
He was so explosive.

563
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:08,040
I don't think there's anybody
that could defend Michael.

564
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:10,668
We come back and we win the game.

565
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,005
From that point on,
everybody on that team felt like,

566
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:16,215
"This young kid is not gonna let us lose."

567
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:20,219
Everybody on that Bull team,
within a two-week period,

568
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:22,430
knew he was the best player we had.

569
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:25,683
<i>And now the noise factor
begins to really increase.</i>

570
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:29,020
<i>Here is the man, Michael Jordan,
from North Carolina,</i>

571
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:31,397
<i>the number-three pick in the NBA draft.</i>

572
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,030
<i>Jordan... What a move!</i>

573
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:43,409
<i>Jordan on the breakout,
driving all the way and jams it home!</i>

574
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:45,494
As a rookie, he was not a rookie.

575
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:48,998
He proved, right out of the gates,

576
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:51,209
there was none other like him.

577
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:53,502
<i>Driving all the way in...</i>

578
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:56,714
<i>That's unbelievable! He's put it in...</i>

579
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:59,050
It was like he had, like, a...

580
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:00,968
extra levitation gear or something.

581
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,386
It just didn't seem real.

582
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,267
His balance, his footwork,

583
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:09,685
his fundamentals.

584
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:12,605
<i>To Jordan.
Looking for penetration.</i>

585
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:14,106
The dude was just...

586
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,816
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

587
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:20,196
<i>Bodies going flying.
What a move!</i>

588
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:22,782
<i>Jordan driving... What a move!</i>

589
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:28,913
How's the transition been
from college to the NBA?

590
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:30,790
Well, I think it's been pretty easy.

591
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:32,513
<i>♪ Your off-beat DJ, if anything he play ♪</i>

592
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,418
<i>♪ Sound familiar, I'll wait till E say ♪</i>

593
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,837
<i>♪ Play 'em
So I'mma have to diss and broke ♪</i>

594
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,924
<i>♪ You could get a smack for this
I ain't no joke ♪</i>

595
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:57,501
<i>He's only played
professional basketball a few months,</i>

596
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:58,776
<i>but at age 21,</i>

597
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:03,197
<i>Michael Jordan is the National Basketball
Association's hottest draw.</i>

598
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,116
<i>Since he arrived,
the stadium,</i>

599
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:09,161
<i>which used to be two-thirds empty,
has been sold out every game.</i>

600
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:11,372
When Michael first came to town,

601
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:14,959
I didn't have the money to buy tickets
for a Bulls game,

602
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:18,796
even the discount ones, back in the day.
I was pretty broke.

603
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:26,012
But suddenly, you have a sports figure
that put Chicago on the map,

604
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:28,431
and that everybody
was able to rally around.

605
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:32,018
Chicagoans like to think
of themselves as being a little tough,

606
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:34,270
blue collar, roll up your sleeves.

607
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:36,314
You never mail it in.

608
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:40,026
So people love to see somebody
who gives it everything they've got.

609
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,110
Jordan did that.

610
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:46,157
<i>Tonight's attendance: 18,688.</i>

611
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,452
When Michael came in '84,
we got an immediate shot in the arm.

612
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:52,163
The city was just beside herself.

613
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:55,541
The interest just grew,
and it grew dramatically.

614
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:58,294
It was just a phenomenal thing
to watch it.

615
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:03,966
Country boy that comes into the big city
and makes the big city a special place.

616
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,761
Seems like it's exciting again.

617
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:09,263
He does some things
that I just never seen before.

618
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:12,224
Words can't describe him.
He's poetry in motion.

619
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,828
<i>...sellouts everywhere they go...</i>

620
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:19,523
The 1984-85 season will go down in history
as the year Michael Jordan came to town.

621
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:22,485
He has touched the hearts
of Chicagoland and the nation.

622
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:24,195
What's in his immediate future?

623
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:27,031
Coronation as
the NBA's Rookie of the Year.

624
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:32,578
A fitting tribute to a man who rescued
what some considered a dying franchise.

625
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:36,832
The 1984-85 NBA Rookie of the Year:

626
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:37,832
Michael.

627
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:22,378
Don't mess up.

628
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:26,173
Don't mess up. Don't mess up.

629
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:36,475
Come on.

630
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:41,188
- I like this. This is French.
- Okay.

631
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:43,065
- How's the wife?
- Good.

632
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:45,526
- You just get here?
- I was here for the game last night,

633
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:47,528
- when we came in.
- Really? Cool.

634
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,171
- Pretty great.
- Reading all about you.

635
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:51,449
- Enjoyed the photo of you.
- Yeah...

636
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:56,745
You guys are not allowed. Sorry.
Nah, I'm just kidding. Come on.

637
00:40:58,038 --> 00:40:59,478
- Thanks.
- All right.

638
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:06,797
I'd like to thank you for coming along
on this ride, on this fabulous train.

639
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:10,468
You gotta set me up with a schedule
for when I get back.

640
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:12,386
Get this shit taken care of.

641
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,830
- Okay, so that looks good.
- Yeah.

642
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,649
Basketball fans
from around the world

643
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,276
have been gathering since early today,

644
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:30,821
here at the Palais Omnisports de Bercy,
here in Paris.

645
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:33,199
They're here to see
one man, Michael Jordan,

646
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:36,368
five-time NBA champion Chicago Bull.

647
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:55,137
Scottie Pippen wasn't there.
He had an injury,

648
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:57,264
and you figure,
"Well, they don't need him."

649
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:00,017
Dennis Rodman wasn't there either,
he was holding up.

650
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,560
But it was almost irrelevant

651
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:04,021
'cause you knew Michael was going to
annihilate everybody.

652
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:08,984
<i>The Bulls
are without Dennis Rodman</i>

653
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:10,611
<i>and they're without Scottie Pippen.</i>

654
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:14,466
<i>Intimidation,
that's what this is all about.</i>

655
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:18,118
<i>These guys have never played
against a team like this.</i>

656
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:20,788
<i>Nothing but net for Michael Jordan!</i>

657
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:24,625
<i>Jordan... Look out! Three in a row!</i>

658
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:25,793
<i>Jordan...</i>

659
00:42:27,002 --> 00:42:28,045
<i>Oh, baby!</i>

660
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:31,715
Michael played every game
as if it was his last.

661
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:32,800
Every single game.

662
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:35,052
There was never a day off.

663
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:38,472
He knew that there was gonna be
somebody in that crowd

664
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:41,267
that never saw him play before.
That's what kept him going.

665
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:45,604
It wasn't, "I went to see this guy play
and he only got 12 points." Didn't happen.

666
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:50,317
<i>Call Häagen-Dazs 'cause
I want two scoops of this scoop shot.</i>

667
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:53,213
<i>The French players
just helpless out there.</i>

668
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:56,490
<i>The Bulls won by 26.
Jordan,</i> il fait très bien.

669
00:42:58,784 --> 00:43:00,995
Your first championship.
Congratulations, dog.

670
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:02,958
I'll get a bottle of champagne
with you tonight.

671
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:04,038
All right.

672
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:05,958
Can I get a hug, too?

673
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:12,298
- It don't count.
- I'm gonna hug Jeffrey and Marcus, then.

674
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:15,134
- I won a championship, I'mma go tell them.
- It don't count.

675
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:19,513
Good game. All right, man. Good game.

676
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,265
- Can I have your...
- Good game.

677
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:35,613
<i>♪ We can go home, home, home ♪</i>

678
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:46,975
- Is that going to the Berto Center?
- Get out of here.

679
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:50,044
- Is that going to the Berto Center?
- No. Phil, keep it.

680
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:53,714
- Don't let Jerry get it.
- What?

681
00:43:57,551 --> 00:44:00,429
All right. For all you guys
who have never won before,

682
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:01,930
welcome to being a champion.

683
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:05,976
That's a good start. That's a good start.

684
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,520
Tonight, Michael put on quite a show.

685
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:15,611
And we're proud to go home and continue
on this quest for another championship

686
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:19,031
in 1997-98. Thank you.

687
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:24,828
Phil always looked for a theme
for every season,

688
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:28,791
and given that it was the last year
we were going to be together,

689
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:31,001
management had already made that decision.

690
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:33,712
In typical Phil fashion, you know,

691
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:36,131
he had a name for it.

692
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:39,469
We arrived
at the practice facility.

693
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:42,638
It's our first official meeting as a team.

694
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:44,181
Get the team handbook.

695
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:48,602
Laminated on the front page: Last Dance.

696
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,854
I talked to the players about,

697
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:54,775
particularly, how important
it was for us to really be together

698
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:57,861
in this last run
that we were going to have.

699
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:00,406
So, I called it The Last Dance.

700
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:02,366
That whole meeting was...

701
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:06,370
enjoy what's happening because this is it.

702
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:18,590
<i>Good evening,
and welcome once again to Bulls basketball</i>

703
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:22,511
<i>as the Bulls open the home portion
of their '97-'98 campaign.</i>

704
00:45:22,594 --> 00:45:26,390
Game time programs tonight, folks.
Only two bucks on the outside.

705
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:30,144
If you don't go see Michael Jordan,
you're missing out on life. For sure.

706
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:34,231
She said do you want
Christmas presents under the tree

707
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:39,069
or do you wanna see Michael Jordan
and Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman?

708
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:40,696
- Yeah.
- We picked the Bulls.

709
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:45,409
Bulls caps, T-shirts!
Right here! T-shirts!

710
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:49,788
<i>Tonight, Jordan and the Bulls
return to Chicago for the ring ceremony.</i>

711
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:52,708
<i>It's not like the first time,
but it ain't bad for MJ and company.</i>

712
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:54,543
<i>Ring number five and banner number five.</i>

713
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:57,306
Your fifth ring ceremony
just as exciting as the first?

714
00:45:57,755 --> 00:46:01,175
Even more so. You put it in perspective
so we're looking for number six.

715
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:02,843
Good luck tonight. Thanks for stopping.

716
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:04,446
<i>Always nice to hear Michael</i>

717
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,680
<i>talk about the possibility
of winning number six.</i>

718
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:08,682
<i>And you'll see that ring ceremony.</i>

719
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:10,893
<i>It's only moments away,
here at the United Center.</i>

720
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:16,732
This is the last night

721
00:46:16,815 --> 00:46:18,984
we celebrate the championship
of last year.

722
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:21,403
It's going to be a nice celebration,
and we'll enjoy it.

723
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:24,948
What's important is winning this game.
We've got to start off with a win.

724
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:26,742
Okay. So get yourself back in tune

725
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:29,286
to what we have to do,
and take care of business tonight.

726
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:30,621
Okay. All right, guys.

727
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:38,021
<i>David Stern,
thank you for talking to us.</i>

728
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:38,961
<i>Good to be here.</i>

729
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:41,402
<i>Talk about the perspective
you can put on this team</i>

730
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:42,966
<i>and what it has meant to your league.</i>

731
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:45,511
<i>There'll never be
quite another team like this.</i>

732
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:50,182
<i>They have gotten to be
the number-one sports team in the world.</i>

733
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:54,436
It's a very exciting time in the life
of the league and in my life, too.

734
00:47:02,444 --> 00:47:03,987
How's it going? You gonna warm up now?

735
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:05,989
Yeah, we just gonna warm up right now.

736
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:09,493
Look, Jerry, you wanna
do some layups with us?

737
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:10,576
Yep.

738
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,746
- They gotta lower the rim.
- Yep.

739
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:16,834
<i>I'm here on behalf
of basketball fans around the world</i>

740
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:22,089
<i>to congratulate
the 1997 NBA champion Chicago Bulls,</i>

741
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:28,262
<i>a team for our time, the basketball team
of our time and one for the ages.</i>

742
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:32,891
The architect of the 1996-97
Bulls championship team

743
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:35,686
and two-time executive of the year,
Jerry Krause!

744
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,443
Phil Jackson, the coach!

745
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:53,704
And now, your five-time world champion
Chicago Bulls!

746
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:05,465
Bill Wennington!

747
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,926
Steve Kerr!

748
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,970
Toni Kukoc!

749
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:12,514
Dennis Rodman!

750
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:16,727
Scottie Pippen!

751
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:23,442
From North Carolina,

752
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:28,572
at guard, 6'6", Michael Jordan!

753
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:39,416
If you guys remember in 1984

754
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:42,002
when they drafted Michael Jordan
to the city of Chicago...

755
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:46,715
I said then that we would be champions
by the time I leave.

756
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:49,635
Well, we are five-time champions,
going for six,

757
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:53,472
and we need your support.
Thank you very, very much.

758
00:48:57,184 --> 00:49:00,187
<i>That season could be the end,
you know.</i>

759
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:03,482
<i>It could very well be the end,
and we had to think that way.</i>

760
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:06,735
Let's get refocused back in this game,
let's get out of the blocks quickly,

761
00:49:06,818 --> 00:49:08,654
and let's do what we did last time.
Let's go.

762
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:11,698
- What time is it?
- Game time!
