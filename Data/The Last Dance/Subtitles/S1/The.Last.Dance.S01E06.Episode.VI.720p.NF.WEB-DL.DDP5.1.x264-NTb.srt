1
00:00:07,048 --> 00:00:08,425
Here we go. Quiet!

2
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:10,486
- Roll sound!
- Rolling.

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:11,510
Two.

4
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:14,723
It's funny, a lot of people say
they'd like to be Michael Jordan

5
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:16,141
for a day or for a week,

6
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:20,770
but let them try to be Michael Jordan
for a year, see if they like it.

7
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:22,981
Let's get one more.

8
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:24,845
- Rolling.
- Two.

9
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:28,862
It's funny, a lot of people told me
they'd like to be Michael Jordan

10
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:30,447
for a day or for a week,

11
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,908
but I don't think you can see
the true Michael Jordan for just a day.

12
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:38,078
Rolling.

13
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,123
Cameras.

14
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:44,794
It's funny, a lot of people say
they'd like to try to be Michael Jordan

15
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,087
for a day or for a week,

16
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:50,133
but I don't think
they quite understand it's no fun.

17
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:52,385
Good. Okay.

18
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:10,195
All right, well,
I just wanted to touch base...

19
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:17,827
This is it. Lay back, watch TV all day.

20
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:22,290
It was peaceful until you guys
come up in here.

21
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,794
I don't have to worry about
anybody bothering me.

22
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:31,091
I think what people don't realize

23
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:36,012
is that from the moment
Michael Jordan leaves his hotel room,

24
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:37,806
the spotlight is on him.

25
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:50,401
Everybody in the world
wanted to see him, talk to him.

26
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:54,531
They all wanted a piece of him
in some way or another.

27
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:59,452
He was under pressure to be "on"
all the time with people.

28
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,579
Could I get a picture with you and my son?

29
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,081
Skipping nursery school, huh?

30
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,754
Given his hectic schedule,

31
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:13,716
before a game, he would sit down
for five minutes, ten minutes,

32
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,677
with a terminally ill child...

33
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,887
- You ain't got a birthday, do you?
- No.

34
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,682
He made the kids feel like
they knew Michael Jordan.

35
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:26,062
On top of all that,
he had to perform.

36
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:30,567
<i>Jordan! The double-clutch
reverse layup. Michael Jordan!</i>

37
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,946
He knew that everybody,
for every game, was there to see him.

38
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:41,995
After the game, he has ten minutes
in the locker room to cool off,

39
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:45,123
and then a room full of media.

40
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:47,017
How do you deal
with all the attention?

41
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,881
How will you
entertain us tonight?

42
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,212
Even when he's done
with the interviews,

43
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:54,424
you still had the hanger-on people
that would come up to him.

44
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:58,595
It was like a flock of bees around honey,
trailing him down the hallway.

45
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:02,098
Listen, everybody! Can we move this way,
spread out a little?

46
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,975
I swear he ain't gonna run away.

47
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:08,104
Then you get back to the hotel,
another large group of people.

48
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:18,990
<i>I wouldn't want to be like Mike.
It's an impossible task.</i>

49
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,244
Yeah, this is not...

50
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,623
one of those lifestyles that you envy,

51
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:30,001
where you can't...
You're confined to this room.

52
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:34,214
I'm ready for getting out of this life.

53
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:36,382
You know when you get to that point.

54
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:41,554
I'm there. And with no reservations
at all. I'm there.

55
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,476
<i>A spectacular move!</i>

56
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,144
<i>The game's over!</i>

57
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,563
<i>Chicago Stadium is going wild!</i>

58
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:55,026
<i>First of all,
there's no backstabbing going on here.</i>

59
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:55,985
<i>It's time for me to move on.</i>

60
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,469
<i>This will be Phil's last year
as coach of the Bulls.</i>

61
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,636
- <i>Are the expectations too high?
- Where do we go from here?</i>

62
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,162
<i>The only question: how long can it last?</i>

63
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,600
<i>Wayne, Kovalev and Gretzky.
And the...</i>

64
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,227
That's still not...

65
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,147
Don't show the money.

66
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,357
How much you want?

67
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,525
Wait, I gotta learn.

68
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:36,818
I need another quarter.

69
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:38,569
You only need one. Shit.

70
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:41,423
- That didn't look good.
- Not that one.

71
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,908
They get all the tries
till they get one close.

72
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:47,578
- I get three or two tries to beat 'em.
- This is the last one. I mean it.

73
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:52,458
- Oh, all right, how many tries?
- I get three tries.

74
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,169
That's too far.
Two tries on that one, MJ.

75
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,087
Two tries.

76
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,357
- Look at how far that is.
- Okay, Jerry Krause.

77
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,300
Negotiate with somebody else.

78
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:05,057
- Will you get out the way?
- Come on!

79
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:09,684
Nope.

80
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,312
- That's in.
- No.

81
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,188
Nope! No!

82
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:17,251
- Get our money!
- No!

83
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,777
- Get our money, Travis.
- All right.

84
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,447
Michael was competitive
at everything,

85
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:26,409
whether it was on the golf course
or playing cards, whatever it was.

86
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:29,495
I mean,
his life was just one big competition.

87
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,540
Scottie, Michael...

88
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:34,876
Ron Harper.

89
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,422
These guys would play cards
in the back of the plane for major money.

90
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:41,799
I'm talking thousands of dollars.

91
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:44,802
This is my way
of giving some of my money back.

92
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:45,970
Does it hurt?

93
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:50,475
And me, John Paxson, B.J. Armstrong,

94
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:54,479
we would play blackjack in the front
of the plane for a dollar a hand.

95
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:57,231
He knows that we would never
play with him in the back

96
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,483
'cause it's too much money.

97
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:01,152
But he would come to the front,
"What are you guys doing?

98
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:02,528
You mind if I play?"

99
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,406
I remember John Paxson
looking at him and going,

100
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,201
"Why in the hell
do you want to play with us?

101
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:10,244
We're playing for a dollar a hand."

102
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:15,416
I remember he looked at him, "Because I
wanna say I got your money in my pocket."

103
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,295
I'll give y'all four tries
to beat my one toss.

104
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,713
- One toss?
- Yeah.

105
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:21,839
- In four tries?
- Yeah.

106
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,049
- Yeah, I take it.
- Okay.

107
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:24,884
Put your money up first.
Without seeing it.

108
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,386
- How much? $20?
- Yup.

109
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:32,409
- You can beat that.
- In four tries. Come back here.

110
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:42,068
- Give him his...
- Hey, Gus, CT.

111
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:48,449
Hey, man, your stuff rolls.
He's out here, it just rolls up there.

112
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,660
Watch this roll
right into my pocket.

113
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,996
- I got good at this.
- Y'all get out of here.

114
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,957
Go protect the damn United Center.

115
00:06:56,499 --> 00:07:00,044
Security! Come get security outta here!

116
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:01,628
Arrest you.

117
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,345
Hey, Mike. Hey, Scottie.

118
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,432
- Okay, my brother.
- This guy's funny.

119
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:15,726
- I'm sure you have full season tickets.
- You guys know the money man here?

120
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,228
Yeah, we know him.

121
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,313
We knew him well.

122
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,110
We used to see him in the playoffs.
We don't know about this year.

123
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,591
<i>Welcome to another edition
of Bulls basketball.</i>

124
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:32,493
<i>The Bulls remain just one game away</i>

125
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:36,330
<i>from securing home-floor advantage
in the Eastern Conference playoffs.</i>

126
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,332
<i>They could do it with a win tonight.</i>

127
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:42,044
<i>Pippen gets the screen
from Wennington...</i>

128
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,797
<i>Rodman goes backdoor,
Jordan at the baseline.</i>

129
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,801
<i>Boy, Michael versus Orlando
is a mismatch so far tonight.</i>

130
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:52,346
<i>Jordan ahead of Pippen. And the jam!</i>

131
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:57,185
<i>Bo Outlaw back quickly.
Kerr tees up a three! Ring it up!</i>

132
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,688
<i>Thirty-seven for Jordan.
I think that's the dagger.</i>

133
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:03,357
<i>And this one is history.</i>

134
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:09,113
<i>Chicago Bulls, with an 87-78 victory
over the Orlando Magic,</i>

135
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,782
<i>win their 60th game of the season.</i>

136
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:27,548
Sixty wins.

137
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:35,515
After a hard day,

138
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,935
I would take grape Gatorade, but...

139
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:41,811
I don't think so.

140
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,273
That's all we be thinking about
in the fourth quarter.

141
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,234
- Icy, icy beer.
- Cold beer.

142
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:49,946
I don't know why y'all filming.

143
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,281
We don't want y'all filming us
drinking no beer.

144
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:55,034
I don't care what you film.

145
00:08:56,327 --> 00:09:00,915
Hey, if they go back...
go back ten years ago,

146
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:03,251
you'd see half the brothers
drinking a case.

147
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,211
At halftime!

148
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:06,754
When I first joined the team,

149
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:09,298
they was drinking beers
at half and smoking cigarettes.

150
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,591
And you know what?

151
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,637
Shit, they was getting the cigarettes
from the coaches.

152
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,308
Yo, Stan, can I borrow a cigarette?

153
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,392
Motherfucker...

154
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,994
- Your drinking problem...
- Don't tell 'em that.

155
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,207
- I gotta do the press.
- Have to do it?

156
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,941
- I'm going out the other way.
- All right.

157
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,568
How you doing?

158
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,279
Man, you tripping?

159
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,742
So you coming back
next year, Michael?

160
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:56,137
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
your world champion Chicago Bulls!</i>

161
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,848
Once again, I wanna say thanks.

162
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,350
It's been eight years,
going into my ninth year.

163
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:05,187
We got two championships,
and hopefully we got a lot left.

164
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,274
Hopefully we can bring more
championships to Chicago. Thanks!

165
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:19,994
<i>You don't have to be a sports
fan to know that this man is beyond human.</i>

166
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:25,082
<i>At age 30, Jordan has led
the Chicago Bulls to NBA championships,</i>

167
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:29,003
<i>the Dream Team to an Olympic gold medal,
and most importantly,</i>

168
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:32,757
<i>he's given America, and the world,
a sorely needed hero.</i>

169
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,509
<i>A Jordan sighting sparks a frenzy.</i>

170
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,762
<i>- His touch, a burst of tears.</i>
- You're good.

171
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:41,641
<i>And being Mike means being
the most popular human on the planet.</i>

172
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:45,061
Michael Jordan had become such a huge

173
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:48,439
cultural figure in the early '90s.

174
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,317
He was so widely celebrated,

175
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,904
inevitably there's going to be someone

176
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,740
who's going to
start trying to find some dirt.

177
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,994
I guess one of the things
that started problems

178
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,914
was Sam Smith's book, <i>Jordan Rules.</i>

179
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:10,544
I'd been an investigative reporter
when I started my journalism career.

180
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,922
I wasn't a typical sports reporter
coming in.

181
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,800
I was interested in what happened
behind the scenes.

182
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:19,553
Every time I look up, you've been on TV.
You must be carrying one with you now.

183
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:22,264
<i>'Cause everybody always said,
"Pull the curtain back.</i>

184
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,767
<i>What really goes on in the locker room?"</i>

185
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,313
When you do books like that,
you gotta have controversial things,

186
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:33,693
you gotta have things that are, you know,
people would not suspect or know.

187
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:37,446
<i>The</i> Sun-Times <i>reports the book
details conflicts within the team.</i>

188
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,741
The book outlines
alleged turmoil on the club

189
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,702
during its run for the title last season.

190
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:46,205
It alleges Jordan was kind of
a tough guy with some of his teammates.

191
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:48,749
Everybody got tired of seeing
the McDonald's and the Cokes

192
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:49,875
and all the other stuff.

193
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:54,255
They really wanted to see something
other than something positive.

194
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,967
I was shocked when it exploded
like it did.

195
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:04,098
But the book is popular because it made it
public that Michael Jordan is not perfect.

196
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,391
Not everybody loves him.

197
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:07,601
He wasn't particularly beloved
by his teammates.

198
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:10,020
<i>Michael told teammates</i>

199
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,982
<i>not to pass the ball to a certain player
during crunch time.</i>

200
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,276
<i>Threatening the others,
saying, if they did it,</i>

201
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:17,820
<i>they would never
get the ball from him again.</i>

202
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:21,782
<i>Jordan also allegedly punched
Will Perdue during a practice session.</i>

203
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,660
Everybody loved Michael around the world.

204
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,955
But after Sam Smith's book, <i>Jordan Rules,</i>

205
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:32,668
there was a certain backlash
and some of the brightness had come off.

206
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:38,382
People saw a side
that we didn't see before.

207
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:42,136
<i>Concerning team GM Jerry Krause,
Jordan says,</i>

208
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:45,848
<i>"This thing isn't over.
I'm going to get that guy fired."</i>

209
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,975
Jerry invited me
to come to his room,

210
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:53,397
and he had earmarked
about 25 different quotations in the book.

211
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:56,734
He wanted me to sit and listen to them
while he read them.

212
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:02,364
And that started with, "Who do you think
could do this? Were you part of this?"

213
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:05,743
<i>While the early reports have brought
a flurry of denials,</i>

214
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:08,245
<i>players giving out sensitive information
to the press</i>

215
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:11,624
<i>is one surefire way
to cause a division within the team.</i>

216
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:14,335
I didn't contribute to that.
That was Horace.

217
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:18,631
He was telling everything
that was happening within the group.

218
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:22,843
As we started
winning championships,

219
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:27,056
and everybody talked about Michael,
and talked about "everybody else,"

220
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:31,435
I mean, that really pissed off Horace.

221
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:36,357
He felt slighted.
He was in Michael's shadow.

222
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:42,238
No. Not one thing have I ever
divulged to Sam Smith

223
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:46,659
about my relationship
with my former teammates.

224
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:50,871
A lot of people, because Sam and I
have a great relationship,

225
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:55,334
used me as a scapegoat, and... so be it.

226
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,169
It couldn't have just been Horace.

227
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,505
Had to be coming from
a number of different places.

228
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:02,132
It could've been the coaches,

229
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:05,469
it could've been the owners,
it could've been management.

230
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,556
We have a star
for five or six years,

231
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,141
and then, pretty soon,
people start chipping away

232
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,477
at the pedestal of that star or that hero

233
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:14,979
and try to knock him off the block.

234
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:18,858
If I'm going to be knocked off
this pedestal,

235
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,610
I'm going to make sure I do something
to be knocked off.

236
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,905
I'm not going to let someone else
knock me off for no apparent reason

237
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,824
or comments that I didn't say.

238
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,792
<i>While some of
Michael Jordan's teammates</i>

239
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,745
<i>view the book as "a bunch of bull,"</i>

240
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:36,709
<i>Smith says it may have a positive effect
down the road on the world champions.</i>

241
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,378
I think Phil will use this book
to say,

242
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:43,632
"Here, this is out there.
They're trying to divide us apart."

243
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,801
In a lot of ways,
it'll bring the team together.

244
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:50,055
<i>I was under siege when the book came out.
Everyone turned on me,</i>

245
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,266
<i>to the point where
I was getting a lot of threats</i>

246
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:55,686
<i>and the newspaper had me stay home
for a week, told me not to come.</i>

247
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:01,025
The Jordan Rules <i>took a big toll on him
off the court.</i>

248
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:06,280
<i>But on the court, he was still
the most dominant figure in the game</i>

249
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:07,865
<i>on the most dominant team.</i>

250
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:18,667
<i>And Horace with the slam!</i>

251
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,794
<i>Jordan intercepts.
What a play!</i>

252
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,212
<i>They're tearing them apart.</i>

253
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,924
<i>Fourteen.
Jordan past Petrovic.</i>

254
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:36,518
<i>Michael blocked him...
...denied by Horace...</i>

255
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,730
<i>...three on two. To Jordan. And a foul...</i>

256
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:41,607
<i>Oh, he scored! Yes!</i>

257
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:49,156
<i>Michael in control, feeds Horace Grant.</i>

258
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,283
<i>Michael on the line.</i>

259
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:02,336
<i>No fouling here.
From mid-court, a 50-footer to go...</i>

260
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:03,587
<i>Michael Jordan!</i>

261
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,258
A lot of the people in...

262
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:12,888
that era that you would consider
Michael's peers had won two in a row.

263
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,892
Isiah won two straight.
Magic had won two straight.

264
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,395
But none of them won three in a row.

265
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:22,606
A third championship was the separator.

266
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,733
You win three, you're on Mount Rushmore.

267
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:28,737
So, for that team, it was all about
winning a third straight.

268
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,115
Who was their biggest obstacle?

269
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:35,786
Without question,
it was this incredibly... tough,

270
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:39,748
motivated and well-coached Knicks team.

271
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:45,754
In the early '90s, the Knicks replaced
the Bad Boy Pistons

272
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,132
as the team that Chicagoans
hated the most.

273
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:51,468
It was very intense 'cause I know
how bad they wanted to beat us.

274
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,472
<i>Both clubs going at each other.</i>

275
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:58,684
<i>Michael Jordan and Xavier McDaniel
having words.</i>

276
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:03,313
<i>Double technicals were called
on McDaniel and Jordan.</i>

277
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:08,902
They were on the come up.
They were trying to be...

278
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:14,533
the next Chicago Bulls
as we were to the Detroit Pistons.

279
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:18,620
Mentally,
they were a hard-working team,

280
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:23,751
but I firmly believe that...
when we were playing at our best

281
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:26,253
and they're playing at their best,
we're a better team.

282
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:30,883
Patrick Ewing was the biggest focus
for us, offensively.

283
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,052
We hated each other.

284
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,055
It was extremely physical.

285
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:41,060
It wasn't really a foul
till you drew blood.

286
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,854
When I was coaching the Knicks,

287
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:46,440
I told the team,
"You can't let him dunk on you!"

288
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,151
Hello!

289
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,989
You gotta knock him down.

290
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:57,493
If we don't meet him at the rim,
he's gonna embarrass you.

291
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,996
<i>...ball that he followed up.
Jordan with the recovery. Jordan!</i>

292
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,544
Only way we can beat this guy,

293
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:08,796
we had to hit him,

294
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:11,298
let him know that
you just can't fly to the rim.

295
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,139
The battle lines
were drawn between them.

296
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:24,269
And then, 1993 playoffs, they're playing
the Knicks in the Conference Finals.

297
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,984
<i>It has come down to this: game one</i>

298
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:33,737
<i>of the eagerly anticipated best-of-seven
Eastern Conference Final.</i>

299
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,864
<i>Patrick Ewing and his New York Knicks</i>

300
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,742
<i>facing Michael Jordan
and the Chicago Bulls.</i>

301
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:43,705
We got tested in that playoffs
by the Knicks.

302
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:50,337
The Knicks had that same defense that
we'd just had to overcome versus Detroit.

303
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,256
They were gonna be physical,

304
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:54,883
they were gonna come up
body-to-body all the time.

305
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,427
<i>Things beginning to get a bit rough.</i>

306
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:58,929
That was a tremendous battle.

307
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:10,983
<i>The basket counts and the foul!</i>

308
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:18,323
<i>So the Knicks defeat the Bulls in game one
of this best-of-seven.</i>

309
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:22,452
<i>Jordan knows that
all eyes are on him tonight</i>

310
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:26,206
<i>as the Bulls go for the needed split in
New York in the Eastern Conference Finals.</i>

311
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,792
<i>After shooting 3-for-13
in the second half Sunday,</i>

312
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,878
<i>Jordan needs to light it up in game two.</i>

313
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,815
<i>And Jordan... Just ran...</i>

314
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,425
<i>He is walloped by Anthony!</i>

315
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,468
<i>Now the Bulls are very upset.</i>

316
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:40,804
In the second game
in the series,

317
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:43,765
they were stepping things up,
really physical.

318
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:45,893
<i>Ewing! And...</i>

319
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,812
<i>Look out! Cartwright submarines.</i>

320
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,772
<i>Starks! Yes!</i>

321
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:57,196
<i>What a move by Starks,
who was able to sky to the basket!</i>

322
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:05,162
<i>In sports, the Chicago Bulls
are down two games to none</i>

323
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:07,331
<i>in their playoff series
with the New York Knicks.</i>

324
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:11,919
<i>Some are suggesting that superstar
Michael Jordan may have dropped the ball.</i>

325
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:14,546
<i>In the last quarter against
the Knicks Tuesday night,</i>

326
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,381
<i>Michael Jordan looked tired.</i>

327
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:20,344
<i>Was he worn down by the Knicks' defense
in a grueling physical game</i>

328
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:21,762
<i>or was he worn down</i>

329
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:25,891
<i>by a visit to this Atlantic City hotel
on the eve of the game?</i>

330
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:27,935
<i>The </i>New York Times<i> said today</i>

331
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:32,105
<i>Jordan was seen in the hotel's casino
as late as 2:30 in the morning.</i>

332
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,816
My father said,
"Let's get away from New York City.

333
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,361
Let's you and I go to Atlantic City."

334
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:41,823
We got a limo, we went and gambled
for a couple of hours. We came back.

335
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:46,828
Everybody went totally ballistic.
"Hey, he was in a casino last night."

336
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:50,040
I wasn't late.
We got home by 12:30, one o'clock.

337
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:53,293
The reason I was there was more or less
to get away from New York,

338
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:57,297
hear about all the losing,
you know, the game situation.

339
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,341
I went out to get my mind away
from basketball.

340
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,676
I couldn't go play golf,

341
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,011
so I rode up there
with my family and friends.

342
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,555
<i>Jordan's hours
triggered harsh headlines</i>

343
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,641
<i>and dominated the sports talk shows.</i>

344
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:10,435
What it shows me is a lack of commitment

345
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:13,438
to what is the goal right now,
and that is a third championship.

346
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:18,485
<i>Jordan had violated no team rules,
no league rules, no state laws.</i>

347
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:22,072
<i>All he violated
were people's expectations.</i>

348
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:26,451
I addressed the
Atlantic City thing, and he was like,

349
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:30,247
"Going down to Atlantic City in the
afternoon and getting back at midnight?

350
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,666
That's not gonna affect my basketball.

351
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,835
It's gonna take my mind away

352
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:38,046
from this pressure
we have building up in the playoffs."

353
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:41,341
Why was the trip
to Atlantic City such a big deal?

354
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,385
Okay, the backstory is this.

355
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:46,638
So, the Bulls win in '91.
They win the championship.

356
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:49,766
You go to the White House
when you win the championship.

357
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,101
Ready. Get set...

358
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:53,228
Except Jordan didn't show.

359
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:56,815
He said, "Time with family. I gotta be..."

360
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,942
No, he was out gambling with Slim Bouler.

361
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,741
Slim Bouler was a golf hustler

362
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:09,619
and back in December of 1991,

363
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:13,999
he was brought up on drug
and money laundering charges.

364
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:19,796
And federal agents found a check
made out from Michael Jordan

365
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,091
to Slim Bouler for $57,000.

366
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,969
Jordan initially said,
"That was just a loan I made him."

367
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:32,517
But Michael was a witness in this case
involving Slim Bouler,

368
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:36,646
and Michael admitted
that he was repaying a gambling debt.

369
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:39,483
<i>"What was the money for?"
asked Bouler's attorney.</i>

370
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:43,445
<i>Answer: "It was what I lost gambling.
It was never a loan.</i>

371
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:47,240
<i>I said it was a loan strictly to save
the embarrassment and pain."</i>

372
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:51,286
So, when Michael spends
all night gambling in Atlantic City,

373
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:55,874
after they lost game one,
it became a very public issue

374
00:22:55,957 --> 00:23:01,046
in terms of, "Is this signs of
some kind of a problem with him?"

375
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:04,716
And then you add to that
the Esquinas book,

376
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:09,513
which came out in the midst
of that Atlantic City fiasco.

377
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:13,392
In a book titled
<i>Michael and Me: Our Gambling Addiction,</i>

378
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,977
Richard Esquinas,
a onetime general manager

379
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,646
of the San Diego Sports Arena,

380
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:22,692
makes the claim that Michael Jordan
owed him more than $1.2 million,

381
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:25,278
a result of gambling
on their golf matches.

382
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:28,949
Yeah, Richard Esquinas...
We met from a third party.

383
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:32,119
I'm actually playing golf with people
all the time now.

384
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,745
If they wanna gamble, we gamble.

385
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,622
The character of those individuals,

386
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:39,501
I found out later what kind of people
I was playing with.

387
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,628
I learned that lesson.

388
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:44,756
But the act of gambling,
I didn't do anything wrong.

389
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:50,345
And it right away went right to the most
deepest, darkest kind of side of it.

390
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:51,888
Is he throwing games?

391
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:54,224
Has it gone beyond golf?

392
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:56,017
Never has. Never has.

393
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:58,854
Michael and I were competitive
and gambling on the golf course.

394
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,188
We play cards.

395
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:04,234
I was in many of the card games,
but never anything else.

396
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:08,321
I never bet on games, I only bet
on myself and that was golf.

397
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:11,783
Do I like to play blackjack?
Yeah, I like playing blackjack.

398
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,034
There's no laws with that.

399
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:16,288
And the league did call me
and they asked questions about it,

400
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:18,415
and I told them
exactly what was happening.

401
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:24,254
Michael was betting
on his golf game.

402
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:28,758
Larger numbers than you or I might bet
if we played golf together.

403
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:32,596
But, you know,
given Michael's earnings and the like,

404
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:37,767
we just never... It never reached
epic crisis levels in my view.

405
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:44,441
I understand that people

406
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:46,776
would see and hear about
amounts of money like that

407
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,528
and go, "Wow! That's a lot of money."

408
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:51,364
What I used to always say
to people is that,

409
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:55,744
for Michael Jordan,
$10,000 is like you gambling $10.

410
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:59,289
He's got it. He's good for it.
You don't have to worry about it.

411
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:00,916
The thought has occurred

412
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:03,919
that you aren't really gambling
with money,

413
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:06,421
you're gambling with your reputation.

414
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,924
Gambling with your good name.

415
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:13,720
What would they consider my good name?
The purest of all pure?

416
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,806
The person that doesn't make mistakes?

417
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:20,852
It wasn't all part of this
carefully cultivated image

418
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:24,523
that he had had of being
the best basketball player in the world

419
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:26,650
that everyone wanted to be like.

420
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:29,361
Do you think you have
a gambling problem at all?

421
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:32,113
No. Because I can stop gambling.

422
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,949
I have a competition problem.

423
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:36,409
A competitive problem.

424
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:41,039
It didn't affect his endorsements.
It didn't affect him monetarily.

425
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:43,083
It didn't really affect his popularity.

426
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,419
But the damage was to his reputation.

427
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:52,259
And the price to pay
was how tedious this all became

428
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:56,012
for Michael to have to
answer these questions.

429
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:03,228
Were you playing
$1,000-a-hole golf down there?

430
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:05,981
- Is that what was going on?
- Is this an addiction?

431
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,400
When you're answering these questions
over and over again,

432
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:12,153
and feeling you have to defend yourself,
it's exhausting.

433
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,823
Get 'em off the floor. It's one o'clock.

434
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:16,116
Let's start it up.

435
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:22,247
He was really starting
to grate against the media onslaught.

436
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:25,792
Michael becomes irate
and refuses to talk to the media.

437
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:28,962
The curtain of silence
started to come down.

438
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,506
He wanted no part of it.

439
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,593
Let someone like his dad
have to answer these questions for him.

440
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,721
I stopped talking.
My father said, "Let me handle this."

441
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:40,515
I said, "Dad, you don't have to."
He said, "Nah." He wanted to.

442
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:44,019
He has given the best of him.

443
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:48,565
He has sacrificed
to try to satisfy everybody.

444
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:52,694
And after doing all of that,
people still find a way of knocking him.

445
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:55,280
And he's saying,
"Damn, how much is enough?"

446
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:02,120
Around that time,
I remember Magic Johnson saying,

447
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:05,290
"You guys are gonna drive him
out of this game

448
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:07,834
if you keep this up,
'cause he's tired of it.

449
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:09,878
He's tired of you guys picking on him."

450
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:17,302
People build you up
to tear you down.

451
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:19,929
It happens in sports all the time.

452
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:22,974
If a team wins too much,
you want 'em to lose.

453
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:30,982
The public has an appetite for
these kind of rise-and-fall narratives.

454
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:37,447
Let's go, baby! Let's go!

455
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:40,950
I think he was disgusted
with what happened,

456
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:43,286
and Michael had to respond.

457
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:46,998
And respond he did.

458
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,586
<i>Here's Jordan for the fadeaway.</i>

459
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,840
<i>Jordan off the hesitation dribble!</i>

460
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:59,719
<i>Look out! Starks went
barreling into Pippen.</i>

461
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:03,098
<i>And Starks in the face of Pippen
who just looks to walk away.</i>

462
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,933
<i>Look out. They're pushing and shoving.</i>

463
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:08,436
<i>And they continue on!
Jordan wants a go at him!</i>

464
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:15,694
<i>The team rally
in the support of Michael Jordan.</i>

465
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:18,947
<i>He is so upset
with the criticism he received</i>

466
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,865
<i>for his journey down to Atlantic City.</i>

467
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:25,453
<i>A convincing Chicago Bulls victory.</i>

468
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:29,332
Michael could make things up
to motivate himself.

469
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,626
He didn't have to make anything up.
This was real.

470
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,337
This was the media scolding you.

471
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:38,591
And he says, "I'll show you." And he did.

472
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:53,523
<i>A standing ovation
for the Chicago Bulls.</i>

473
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:57,235
<i>Fifty-four points for Michael Jordan.</i>

474
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:09,080
Game five. The series is tied.

475
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:16,671
The Bulls are up one
with 20 seconds left,

476
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:20,717
and there's poor Charles Smith trying
his best to get the ball into the basket.

477
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,344
<i>Ewing for Smith! Smith!</i>

478
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:28,600
<i>Smith! Smith... stopped!
Smith stopped again by Pippen!</i>

479
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:30,185
<i>What a play by Scottie Pippen!</i>

480
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,936
Jordan and Pippen and Grant

481
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:37,484
simply refusing to let the ball
go in the basket. Wouldn't allow it.

482
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,488
It's one of the great defensive sequences
of all time.

483
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,449
<i>The Bulls
have defeated the Knicks!</i>

484
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:50,830
That's the series. They close it out
in Chicago the next game.

485
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:03,843
<i>There it is!
Chicago going on to the NBA Finals.</i>

486
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:08,431
<i>Chicago will attempt to three-peat,</i>

487
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:14,479
<i>trying to be become only the third team
in NBA history to pull off three in a row.</i>

488
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:18,024
Did you feel all that negative publicity
about Michael going to Atlantic City

489
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:19,734
really pulled you guys together?

490
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,486
Yeah, we take that personally.

491
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:23,738
We're a team,
we've been a team a long time,

492
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:26,241
and when you attack one of ours,
we gotta bond together.

493
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:28,910
It's the only thing we have,
and it showed on the floor.

494
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:40,880
- 11:45.
- What is it?

495
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:43,925
- Eleven... Oh, I'm sorry. 1:45.
- Let's go, Phil!

496
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:46,553
Ten minutes over!

497
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:49,722
- Let's go. Where you going?
- I'm ready.

498
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,516
- Let's go. Come on.
- You hear that?

499
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:54,352
- Nah, come on. Y'all miss out on this.
- How's it going?

500
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:57,689
- Now that's entertainment.
- 1:45.

501
00:30:58,565 --> 00:30:59,774
Let's go!

502
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:03,111
He's got a tee time at 3:30.

503
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:07,073
Scottie,
can I talk to you for a sec?

504
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:09,701
Nah, man, we done. We outta here.
Let's go, Pip. Come on.

505
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:11,703
- Just till Phil comes by.
- Nah.

506
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:13,371
- Michael!
- Come on!

507
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,124
He's healthy,
he'll be playing tomorrow.

508
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:17,834
He's got a tee time!

509
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,254
Scottie, how're you feeling?
Everything all right?

510
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:23,590
Yeah, I'm feeling good,
just a little sore.

511
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:35,101
Is there... Is there any chance
Mike has got a tee time?

512
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,398
Come on, get on here, Bill.
Hey, give me 20 cents.

513
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:42,942
He must be ready to go.
Driver's getting mad at you.

514
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:47,113
Y'all gotta pay a fare to get on this bus.
Let's go. Get out the way!

515
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:51,302
- You know how to put it in gear?
- Yeah, watch this.

516
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:52,327
Oh, no.

517
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:54,370
- Get back.
- We got it.

518
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:55,454
Let's go.

519
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:56,872
What?

520
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:02,629
You going to the swimming pool, guys?

521
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:04,088
No, I'm going to Hooters.

522
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:07,842
Watch some tits and ass. The shit!

523
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:12,472
Let's go, man.

524
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:14,432
Don't leave that spot. Hold on!

525
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:15,767
Come on, Ron Harper!

526
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,810
Don't y'all be trying
to run out of here!

527
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:19,938
Come on, Ron. You taking all day.

528
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:22,065
Throw the clubs up here
and come sit next to me.

529
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:24,943
You all right, though?

530
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,528
Bye-bye!

531
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:30,531
All right, thanks!

532
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:40,208
- Fore!
- Fore!

533
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,876
- Fore!
- Fore.

534
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,127
That's way past 'em.

535
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:45,922
Choong. Right off their cart.

536
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:48,257
I said, "Fore."
They don't listen.

537
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:52,929
Get your ass in there!

538
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:57,016
- You hit that...
- Garbage!

539
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,436
Shit, I can't get my drive together.

540
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,776
I can't read the green.

541
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:13,116
Didn't even hesitate.
Right off the bat. Get that shit!

542
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:17,412
We broke even on a little side bet.
A hundred. 200.

543
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:19,714
For what?
That wasn't a do/don't one.

544
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:21,666
- Shit!
- You said 100. You didn't say do/don't.

545
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:23,668
I said par-birdie.
What do you think that is?

546
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:24,919
Okay. You right.

547
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,171
But I win $20 on that hole anyway.

548
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,716
No. I win $40 on that hole.

549
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:40,143
That's good about Phil.
Phil knows we need a break.

550
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:48,192
Young coaches,
it would probably be a practice day today.

551
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,946
And you would have some mean guys.

552
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:26,514
<i>As Michael Jordan and the Bulls
get ready to take on the Suns in Phoenix,</i>

553
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:29,650
<i>they're knocking on the door
of the pantheon of the greats.</i>

554
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:32,945
<i>Winning three straight NBA titles
would put Jordan and his teammates</i>

555
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:35,865
<i>in the company
of the great dynasties of the past.</i>

556
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:40,119
Hi, everybody. I'm Bob Costas.
Welcome to the NBA Finals.

557
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:44,916
The news is that Michael Jordan has broken
his two-week media silence.

558
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:47,335
About an hour and a half before
the game began,

559
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:50,797
he was willing to talk specifically
to Ahmad Rashad.

560
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:54,175
Before game one,
Mike goes, "Hey, man,

561
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,844
can you go get a camera?
I wanna do this interview.

562
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:59,597
They've been talking about my gambling.
I'm sick of all this stuff.

563
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,141
Let's just get it done right now."
I went, "Okay."

564
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:06,062
- Do you have a gambling problem?
- No, I enjoy it. It's a hobby.

565
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:08,773
If I had a problem, I'd be starving.

566
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:12,026
I'd be hocking this watch,
my championship rings. I would...

567
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,945
sell my house, I would do this.

568
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:15,113
My wife would've left me

569
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,156
or she'd be starving
or my kids would be...

570
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,951
I do not have a problem. I enjoy gambling.

571
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:23,913
It didn't help that Michael had sunglasses
on when he was doing the interview.

572
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:28,251
Which I was...
"Man, take them sunglasses off."

573
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:32,338
The media has taken it
far greater than what it is.

574
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,258
Soon, whenever I walk away from this game,

575
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:38,928
I think that's the only thing
that people are gonna say

576
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:40,805
was a bad thing about Michael Jordan.

577
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:42,473
Could soon be after this year?

578
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:44,099
Could be.

579
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:52,441
In Phoenix, we had a great year.

580
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,735
We had the best record in the league.

581
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:57,864
And Charles was the MVP that year.

582
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:02,243
I felt very confident
going into that series.

583
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:07,456
We were very determined because,
if there's anybody you wanna beat,

584
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,708
it's Michael Jordan.

585
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:14,463
<i>Barkley behind the back!
Barkley for Majerle for the reverse.</i>

586
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:15,715
<i>Kevin Johnson.</i>

587
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:17,884
<i>Dumas puts it down!</i>

588
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:20,094
Handle the goddamn pressure!

589
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:23,973
I was a little bit upset

590
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:27,101
that I didn't get the MVP that year.
They gave it to Charles Barkley.

591
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:30,605
But with that said, "Okay, fine.
You can have that. I'm gonna get this."

592
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:34,483
<i>Jordan with the steal!
And Jordan goes all the way!</i>

593
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,444
<i>Beautiful finish by Michael!</i>

594
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:41,991
<i>The Purple Heart award
goes to Dan Majerle</i>

595
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:43,701
<i>who has to guard Michael Jordan.</i>

596
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:49,332
I knew that Jerry Krause
loved Dan Majerle.

597
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:53,628
And just because Krause liked him
was enough for me.

598
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:56,339
"You think he's a great defensive player?
Okay, fine.

599
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:58,257
I'mma show you that he's not."

600
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,152
<i>Jordan spins away
on Majerle.</i>

601
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,976
<i>He'll take it all the way to the basket
and drops it in!</i>

602
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,854
I put it in my mindset
that if I don't do this,

603
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:15,024
then they're gonna consider him
on the same level as me.

604
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:18,319
And that motivated me to attack.

605
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:21,364
<i>Jordan off the dribble!</i>

606
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:25,701
<i>So, the Chicago Bulls take game one.</i>

607
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:30,957
<i>They led by as many as 22.
And they win it 100 to 92.</i>

608
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:35,419
Game one of the series could be summed up
in a word: nerves.

609
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:39,298
The Bulls show that experience does pay.
The Suns' lack of it cost 'em.

610
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:44,804
We lost game one
because we were so nervous.

611
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:50,268
But in game two,
I played as well as I could play.

612
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:52,103
<i>Barkley from the outside!</i>

613
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:56,190
<i>Barkley! Barkley! Barkley...</i>

614
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:59,527
And Michael just outplayed me.

615
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:01,988
<i>Jordan... Yes.</i>

616
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:04,573
<i>Jordan. Jordan.</i>

617
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:09,078
<i>The Suns looking down
a real dark road right now.</i>

618
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:12,873
That was probably
the first time in my life

619
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:16,210
that I felt there was a better
basketball player in the world than me,

620
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,378
to be honest with you.

621
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:23,092
<i>So the final score: the Bulls 111, the Suns 108.</i>

622
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:27,096
We had won two games in Phoenix,

623
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:30,683
and we came back to Chicago and, like,
"Let's finish this out."

624
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:37,732
<i>Jordan. With room.
For three! Yes!</i>

625
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,901
Michael is not beating us!

626
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:46,532
Don't let him catch. Double him.
Make somebody else win the game.

627
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:50,411
<i>Barkley setting
for the three. And he hits it!</i>

628
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:51,787
It was, like...

629
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:57,668
one of the most roller-coaster series
I've ever been in.

630
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:00,713
Game three went into triple overtime.

631
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:03,507
<i>We head off
to a third overtime.</i>

632
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:07,011
Not to brag on myself,
I was not going to let us lose.

633
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:13,112
<i>Johnson came up
with a steal,</i>

634
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:14,560
<i>and Barkley able to finish it off.</i>

635
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:17,813
<i>Barkley on the intercept!</i>

636
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:21,734
<i>Charles Barkley with the interception
and the field goal.</i>

637
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:24,862
<i>The Phoenix Suns in triple overtime</i>

638
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:30,826
<i>have defeated the Chicago Bulls 129-121</i>

639
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:34,205
<i>to battle their way back into this series.</i>

640
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:36,248
After Sunday night's epic,

641
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:40,127
there's a feeling that the Phoenix Suns
are here as foes, not foils.

642
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,837
That they made it a series again.

643
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:44,840
And now it's the Bulls' turn
to respond to a challenge.

644
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:47,385
<i>Jordan... Yes.</i>

645
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:51,847
<i>Jordan around Dumas. Yes! And it counts.</i>

646
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:54,600
<i>Jordan and Ainge trash-talking.</i>

647
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:56,352
<i>Ainge with his hands on Jordan.</i>

648
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:58,813
<i>Jordan just told him,
"Get your hands off me."</i>

649
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:02,400
<i>Bulls with a two-point lead.</i>

650
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:07,696
<i>Jordan... Yes! And it counts!</i>

651
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:17,957
<i>So, the Chicago Bulls have taken
a three games to one lead,</i>

652
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:22,378
<i>led by Michael Jordan who had 55 points.</i>

653
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:25,756
Don't take it personally, Charles!

654
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:32,430
Before game five, they already
started celebrations in Chicago.

655
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:35,516
They were boarding up windows.

656
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:40,146
They want you to celebrate with class
and don't destroy stuff.

657
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:43,524
By the time you get to the game,
you're steaming, to be honest.

658
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:46,944
We're like,
"Guys, we cannot lose this game."

659
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:52,116
<i>Jordan's pass broken up.</i>

660
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:54,452
<i>Johnson for Barkley. Armstrong back.</i>

661
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:58,122
<i>And Charles Barkley extends
to a 27-15 lead.</i>

662
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:01,125
<i>Jordan... Stopped from behind.</i>

663
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:04,503
<i>Dumas got a piece of it.
And Dumas will finish it off.</i>

664
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:09,133
<i>Michael Jordan upset.</i>

665
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,553
<i>I tell you,
the Phoenix Suns are playing better.</i>

666
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:15,222
<i>They're hotter, they're playing better
than the Chicago Bulls,</i>

667
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:16,474
<i>and the Bulls are in trouble.</i>

668
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:17,892
<i>That will do it.</i>

669
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:23,272
<i>The Phoenix Suns, leading most of the way,
remain alive in this best-of-seven</i>

670
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:26,734
<i>but this series goes back to Phoenix.</i>

671
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:31,197
Charles, a final message
to the people of Chicago as you head back?

672
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,115
Take that shit off the windows.

673
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:36,911
You don't need it tonight.

674
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:40,539
We lost game five,

675
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:44,210
so we have to fly out to Phoenix
and play this game number six.

676
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:48,547
Michael got on the plane. He had a cigar.

677
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,550
Then he said
he wanted to speak to the team.

678
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:56,597
Everybody is dreading getting back on
the plane and going back to Phoenix.

679
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,808
So I just say, "Look, man,
I don't know about you guys.

680
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:01,435
I'm only packing one suit.

681
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:04,897
We're going back to win one game.
I'm not going there to play two games."

682
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:07,858
<i>Michael Jordan
on a pull-up. Yes.</i>

683
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:09,276
<i>Jordan for three.</i>

684
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,904
<i>And Michael Jordan has tied the game.</i>

685
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:14,532
<i>Jordan hits another three!</i>

686
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:18,285
Michael had that ability
where he was not going to let them lose.

687
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:21,330
<i>Just under one minute
remaining in this fourth quarter.</i>

688
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:24,083
<i>Suns lead 98 to 94.</i>

689
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:29,547
<i>Frank Johnson, not the man that the Suns
would've wanted to take that shot.</i>

690
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:32,383
<i>And Jordan was able to go the distance.</i>

691
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:34,009
<i>Worst thing to happen!</i>

692
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:36,679
<i>Let 'em score and use up
very few precious seconds!</i>

693
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:38,657
<i>It's Chicago's game
to win or lose.</i>

694
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:41,767
<i>They put 14.1 seconds up,
Suns lead by two.</i>

695
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:44,728
<i>They're gonna put the ball
in Michael Jordan's hands.</i>

696
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:48,774
<i>It's come down to
this possession. The Suns by two.</i>

697
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:50,693
<i>And Pippen got the snatch.</i>

698
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,861
<i>Here's Paxson. For three!</i>

699
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:57,324
<i>Yes! The Bulls
take a one-point lead and...</i>

700
00:42:58,325 --> 00:43:02,204
<i>Yeah! Hits the three!
The crowd is stunned.</i>

701
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:04,582
<i>John Paxson
nails the three!</i>

702
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:08,460
<i>That's the first score by anybody
other than Michael Jordan</i>

703
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:10,379
<i>in the entire fourth quarter!</i>

704
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:12,673
The ball was not supposed to come to me.

705
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:15,342
But as a player, you're always ready.

706
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:21,473
And for me, personally,
it was pretty special.

707
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,226
<i>It's all over!</i>

708
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:30,024
<i>The Chicago Bulls have made it
three straight NBA championships.</i>

709
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:33,694
<i>A three-point shot by John Paxson,
the game winner.</i>

710
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:36,614
I have no problem losing to Michael.

711
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:39,742
Losing to Michael,
there's no shame in that.

712
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:43,829
Sports are like a gunfight.

713
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:48,626
And... we lost to the fastest gun.

714
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:51,753
Whoo!

715
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,926
<i>Physically,
I was getting exhausted,</i>

716
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:02,848
<i>but, mentally, I was
way past exhausted.</i>

717
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:06,268
<i>When you try to do something repetitively,</i>

718
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:10,397
<i>you lose some of the hunger
and some of the edge.</i>

719
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:22,451
Here's the thing. I think,
when we won the third championship,

720
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:28,499
being around him,
there was more relief than true joy.

721
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:32,503
Like, it's over, you know? He was tired.

722
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:36,965
The aftermath, you kind of feel like...

723
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,554
"What are we gonna do?"

724
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:48,352
<i>This has been a very hard and trying time.
This has been a tough year.</i>

725
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:52,398
Do I have to do anything else?

726
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:54,692
- Can I just sit here for a few minutes?
- Yup.

727
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:56,026
Did you want to call your wife?

728
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,695
Yeah, man. Yes.

729
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:08,789
Is it... Is it joy or is it relief
or is it a combination?

730
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:10,833
This has been a great year,
but a tough year.

731
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:14,002
It's both. It's a relief.
Plus it's great to win.

732
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:15,587
I think we've gone through a lot.

733
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:18,507
Me, personally, I've gone through a lot
up to now, but...

734
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:21,468
To cap it off this way
means a lot to me, believe me.

735
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:33,564
My fame is...

736
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:36,066
It was good at the beginning.

737
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,610
Any time people talk about you
in a positive way,

738
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:44,408
yeah, it's great to hear those comments,
but now that you are... on a pedestal,

739
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:46,452
it's not just the positive talking
that you hear.

740
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:49,538
You hear some points and some people
taking shots at you, and...

741
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:55,919
that really changes the whole idea
of being out there for people to see you.

742
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:58,964
You wanna get behind closed doors
so people don't know you as much.

743
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:01,967
So, I'm at that stage in my career
and my life that...

744
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:06,221
I'd rather get behind closed doors
than to be out there in the spotlight

745
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:10,058
to be taking shots from everyone
that really don't know you as a person.

746
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:15,147
<i>If I had the chance
to do it all over again,</i>

747
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:18,275
<i>I would never wanna be considered
a role model.</i>

748
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:21,987
<i>It's like a game
that's stacked against me.</i>

749
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:23,655
<i>There's no way I can win.</i>

750
00:46:57,272 --> 00:47:00,275
I think I've been asked
about a million times,

751
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:02,778
"Is he gonna quit, is he not gonna quit?"

752
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:04,738
I'm having fun making up stuff.

753
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:12,120
No one wants me to walk out,
knowing that I can still play the game.

754
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:14,915
- But I wanna leave two years before...
- Right.

755
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:17,835
...my skills say
that I can't play this game.

756
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:18,918
Mm-hmm.

757
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:22,881
I don't wanna miss my time to go.
There's a lot of players...

758
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:26,093
say that, "I'm gonna play
until I can't play ever again."

759
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:28,720
- Right.
- I think Patrick said that one time.

760
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:32,474
That they'll have to carry him
off the court. You know.

761
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:34,810
- Mm-hmm.
- That's a... Ain't never...

762
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:37,563
Nobody gonna carry me off the court.
I wanna walk off the court.

763
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:43,360
A lot of people say,
"Well, you're gonna miss it."

764
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:47,114
I'm not... I'm not sure
if I'm gonna miss it.

765
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:50,659
I don't think I'm gonna miss it.

766
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:53,912
<i>...Michael is Zen-calm
around the Bulls,</i>

767
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:55,956
<i>as they start their postseason tonight.</i>

768
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:59,126
<i>A calm that blocks out the speculation
about Jordan's retirement,</i>

769
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:02,004
<i>Phil Jackson's departure,
all the front-office politics.</i>

770
00:48:02,087 --> 00:48:04,464
<i>If indeed this is the fabled last dance,</i>

771
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:06,800
<i>then pay attention
because it does begin tonight</i>

772
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,927
<i>for a team
that has a rested Scottie Pippen,</i>

773
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:11,430
<i>the best player in the world,
the top eastern seed,</i>

774
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:14,308
<i>and five games to
tune it up against the New Jersey Nets.</i>
