1
00:00:07,048 --> 00:00:08,758
Scottie, in the paper today,

2
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:11,594
it says that Phil wants
one more year back here

3
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:14,055
and Michael wants $36 million.

4
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:18,226
And it also quotes Jerry Krause
as not ruling out a trade for you,

5
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:21,604
which leaves you flapping in the breeze.
Does that bother you?

6
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:22,688
No.

7
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:27,694
I would love the opportunity
of finishing my career out in Chicago,

8
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:31,656
but if it don't happen,
then I'll just have to look elsewhere.

9
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:35,118
I'm one of the best players
to ever play the game.

10
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,622
I understand what my value is
to this game.

11
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,751
You're underpaid
as one of the top players.

12
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:44,210
What do you think your value is...

13
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:45,420
My day'll come.

14
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,464
My day will come.

15
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:02,062
Thank you.

16
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:06,399
Thank you for all the wonderful moments
that the fans here in this city

17
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:10,445
have shown me and my teammates
for ten long seasons.

18
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:15,700
I've had a wonderful career here,

19
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:19,287
and if I never have the opportunity
to say this again: thank you.

20
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,836
Scottie Pippen
with a tearful thank you.

21
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,214
We thought, for one unconscionable moment,

22
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:31,508
we might be hearing
a retirement statement there.

23
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:38,056
What made me upset was
I knew it was the end of the journey,

24
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:42,143
and I never saw it ending like that.

25
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:46,940
Jerry Krause made everything
real murky when he said,

26
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:49,067
"This is Phil's last year.

27
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:53,321
We're dismantling this team
after this season."

28
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:56,241
We're basically relieved of our duties.

29
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,455
<i>A spectacular move!</i>

30
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,124
<i>The game's over!</i>

31
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:06,543
<i>Chicago Stadium is going wild!</i>

32
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:11,005
<i>First of all, there's
no backstabbing going on here.</i>

33
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,047
<i>It's time for me to move on.</i>

34
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:14,448
<i>This will be Phil's last year
as coach of the Bulls.</i>

35
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:19,615
- <i>Are the expectations too high?
- Where do we go from here?</i>

36
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,142
<i>The only question: how long can it last?</i>

37
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:37,198
I'm being squished.

38
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,242
- Sorry.
- Take it easy.

39
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:42,829
Michael, what did you make
of Scottie Pippen's speech?

40
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:44,789
He was kind of caught up in emotions.

41
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,167
Scottie has feelings.

42
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,004
He certainly has dedication and love
for the city of Chicago and, uh...

43
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:57,010
you know, it's tough when you have
so much appreciation for the fans

44
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:59,345
who have supported you for so many years

45
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,639
and sometimes,
when you get out there and speak,

46
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,309
it has to touch you deep down inside, um,

47
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,895
and with all that's happened thus far,

48
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:10,231
it certainly can be
a very emotional situation for him.

49
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,484
Have you talked
with him at all...

50
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:16,029
Are y'all gonna talk about the game
or about Scottie?

51
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:17,028
A little bit of both.

52
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,070
Well, you talk to Scottie
to answer Scottie's reply.

53
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:21,051
- Okay, what about the game, then?
- There you go.

54
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,897
Scottie Pippen
was the underrated,

55
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,984
underappreciated Robin
to Michael's Batman.

56
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:58,821
<i>I would never be able to find
a tandem, another support system,</i>

57
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,866
<i>another partner in the game of basketball
like Scottie Pippen.</i>

58
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,576
<i>He was a pleasure to play with.</i>

59
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:06,955
<i>What a show the Bulls
are putting on here.</i>

60
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:11,167
<i>Pippen right back
to Jordan! Yes. Oh, my!</i>

61
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:13,753
Through trial and error,

62
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:18,591
through that kind of blast furnace
that Michael would put people through,

63
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:20,676
Scottie got tough.

64
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:22,804
<i>Scottie coming hard
on the drive,</i>

65
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:26,057
<i>- takes it all the way to the rack... Oh!
- Over Barkley!</i>

66
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,560
And he was lethal, defensively.

67
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,896
<i>Sedale Threatt.
Antonio hard...</i>

68
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,274
<i>- Oh, my, Pippen!
- What a play!</i>

69
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:37,652
<i>Sensational end-to-end defensive action!</i>

70
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:40,737
<i>Oh, Pip!</i>

71
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:45,201
He helped me so much in the way
that I approached the game,

72
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,619
the way I played the game.

73
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,932
Whenever they speak Michael Jordan,
they should speak Scottie Pippen.

74
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,254
When everybody says, well,
I won all these championships.

75
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:59,007
But I didn't win without Scottie Pippen.

76
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:03,845
And, you know, that's why I consider him
my best teammate of all time.

77
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,645
I grew up in a town
of about 3,500 people.

78
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,732
Everybody pretty much knew each other.

79
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:22,488
My mom and my dad were very strong people
and they were about surviving,

80
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:25,950
and obviously that's what they were about
if they had 12 kids.

81
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:32,749
We used to have a basket
in my grandmother's yard.

82
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:36,377
It was in the dirt,
so it would be dusty all the time.

83
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:40,131
It didn't matter. I had old shoes anyway.

84
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:44,093
Everybody was close-knit,
everybody shared everything, you know.

85
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:47,055
It was just a good time.
We didn't even know we were poor.

86
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,560
I was about 11 or 12.

87
00:05:54,937 --> 00:06:00,360
My dad had just gotten home
and as he was eating his dinner,

88
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:01,444
he just, kinda...

89
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:06,366
fell back
and he suffered a stroke.

90
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:13,623
I can still see it every time
I think about it.

91
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:19,504
He lost his speech
and he was stuck in a wheelchair

92
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:22,131
and bedridden for the rest of his life.

93
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:25,593
Six years before that,

94
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:30,431
my second-oldest brother
was in junior high school.

95
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:36,521
A kid fell on him in a PE class
with a wrestling move.

96
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,190
It paralyzed him, so...

97
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,902
- So, you grew up with...
- Two.

98
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:46,155
Yeah. Yeah, with two people
in my house in a wheelchair.

99
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:52,412
Basketball gave me an opportunity
just to get out of the house and play.

100
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:55,415
And didn't need anyone to play with.

101
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:59,335
Dr. J was my childhood hero.

102
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:04,257
I always wanted to play like him
and dunk the basketball like him.

103
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,803
I felt like, that one day,
I was gonna be in his shoes.

104
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:11,264
Yeah, that's every kid's dream.

105
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:15,017
Every kid's dream, wanna play in the NBA
at one time or another.

106
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:18,563
It's just a dream.

107
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,942
He always knew
he was going to make it to the NBA.

108
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:25,194
- And you believed him?
- Not really.

109
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:33,661
Scottie arrived at UCA, and he started off
as being the equipment manager,

110
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:36,330
but he was practicing
and doing all of those things

111
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,040
that he should do with the team.

112
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:45,673
A few guys academically fall off
so some scholarships come available,

113
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,801
and I go back, ask the coach.

114
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,764
I was very persistent
and he finally gave me a scholarship.

115
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:57,810
He came in as a 6'1", 155-pound guard.

116
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,272
I got to watch him play and I thought,

117
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:04,066
"Wow, this guy's got a little something
if he can fill out."

118
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,319
<i>He started lifting weights.</i>

119
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,821
<i>He could handle the ball better,
he could shoot better.</i>

120
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,031
<i>He could jump higher.</i>

121
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:13,367
I was getting better at such a rapid pace.

122
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:17,914
And in my freshman to my sophomore year,
over the summer...

123
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,000
I grew five inches.

124
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:24,921
When I seen him the next time,
he was 6'5".

125
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:27,590
And then the next time I seen him,
he was 6'7".

126
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,676
<i>Beautiful pass and he... Oh!</i>

127
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,970
<i>To Pippen cutting right across the line...</i>

128
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:34,639
He exploded.

129
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:37,600
<i>Three-on-one break,
Parish to Pippen to the...</i>

130
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,395
He kept his guard skills
that he had even when he grew.

131
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,106
<i>Scottie Pippen
underneath McClain...</i>

132
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,108
He could grab a rebound on one end,

133
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:49,487
take it the length of the court,
weave in and out of people and dunk it.

134
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,197
Very few players can do that.

135
00:08:56,911 --> 00:09:00,623
I remember the coach saying, "Scottie,
they out there, they looking for you now."

136
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,505
I was a fanatic basketball fan

137
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:10,758
and I went down and watched Pippen play.
I knew he was gonna be really good.

138
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:13,511
First time I met him, he could hardly
string three words together,

139
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:14,594
he was so shy.

140
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:17,807
By the time he graduated from
the University of Central Arkansas,

141
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,184
which was an NAIA team,

142
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,728
he was the best player
in his division in America.

143
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,230
I just really got excited.

144
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:26,190
When I saw Scottie Pippen
play the first time,

145
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:29,026
I thought, "Oh, my Lord,
he's gonna be a special player."

146
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:32,738
<i>The NBA scouts saw the versatility,
they saw the athletic ability,</i>

147
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,031
<i>they saw the humbleness.</i>

148
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:41,080
The Seattle SuperSonics select
Scott Pippen of Central Arkansas.

149
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:45,668
<i>Scott Pippen
from the University of Central Arkansas.</i>

150
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,337
<i>He's 21 years old,
and that's right, folks,</i>

151
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,048
<i>you probably have never heard
of Scottie Pippen.</i>

152
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,359
Scottie, one year ago,

153
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,552
if someone said you'd be
the fifth player in the draft,

154
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:55,761
what would you have said?

155
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,347
I would have told them, probably,
that they was joking.

156
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,059
I would have figured
it's just been a big joke.

157
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:05,563
Do you know that there's
a deal involving Seattle and Chicago

158
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:06,856
and you're going to be traded?

159
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,357
No, I have not heard about it.

160
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:13,904
- Apparently, you're wearing the wrong hat.
- Yeah?

161
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:17,450
We realized that we were gonna
have to maneuver to get up in the draft

162
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:20,536
to get a higher pick than we otherwise
would have had to get him.

163
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,330
And Krause was able to pull off a trade.

164
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,560
We were able to work a trade
the night before the draft

165
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,878
and technically,
the Seattle club took him for us,

166
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,838
and then we acquired him.

167
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:34,091
You know, Chicago is a great franchise
and probably every player

168
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:37,511
that's sitting out in the audience
wants to be a part of the Bulls.

169
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,972
<i>The Bulls brought in
Scottie Pippen,</i>

170
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:43,225
<i>touted to make
an immediate impact in the NBA.</i>

171
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,309
Let's go!

172
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,897
<i>Scottie Pippen
about to make his big-league debut.</i>

173
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,233
<i>Barkley nearly kicked it away,
plays it outside. Stolen by Pippen!</i>

174
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,943
<i>Scottie Pippen on the breakaway!</i>

175
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,529
<i>Scottie Pippen made the steal</i>

176
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,865
<i>and then jammed
with both hands at the other end.</i>

177
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,508
Scottie talked a lot of trash.

178
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:03,287
Scottie came in and said,
"I'll be better than Michael Jordan..."

179
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,790
as a rookie.

180
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:09,752
I was pretty confident
in who I was as a player.

181
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:13,422
But as a rookie,
you get treated like a rookie and...

182
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:18,427
Charles was a bully,
so he beat me up for saying that.

183
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,388
- He's a rookie here.
- We had a deal...

184
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,684
He get treatment like this
until next year at this time.

185
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,268
All right? All right?

186
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,268
- Yeah.
- Okay.

187
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,480
You gotta slap him.

188
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:32,817
I recognized instantly that, you know,

189
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,779
you're not the top guy
on the basketball team anymore.

190
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,699
<i>Ball tipped away
by Jordan... It's loose.</i>

191
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,659
<i>Ahead to Jordan with the breakaway...</i>

192
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:49,917
Michael was such a superstar
in the game of basketball,

193
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,382
and he was bigger than any superstar
that any sport had ever had,

194
00:11:56,465 --> 00:12:01,804
so it wasn't like he was an average guy,
like, "Let's go have lunch," or whatever.

195
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,140
It was different.

196
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:12,064
Actually, my rookie year,
he gave me a pair of golf clubs.

197
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:15,192
That's a nice thing to do,
to give a rookie a set of clubs.

198
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:20,072
Yeah, he was trying to lure me in
so he could take all my money.

199
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:24,118
Everybody needs
that number two,

200
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:27,037
the person that does the dirty work,
and Pippen was great at it.

201
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:29,415
<i>Here comes Michael,
for a three again.</i>

202
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:33,252
<i>- Scottie with the left hand!
- Wow!</i>

203
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,838
But he was so low paid,

204
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:39,925
he was not even
the 100th highest-paid player in the NBA.

205
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:43,095
Pippen is as underpaid as underpaid gets.

206
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:47,224
Only the 122nd highest-paid player
in the league.

207
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:50,770
Scottie Pippen
signed a deal in 1991.

208
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,022
Do you recall the terms of that deal?

209
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:56,567
I don't recall the terms but I do recall
that it was a longer contract

210
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,319
than I thought was smart for him.

211
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:00,987
Pippen!

212
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,199
I worship you, man!

213
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:09,580
Scottie Pippen signed a deal in 1991
for 7 years for $18 million.

214
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:14,835
And if he'd played it right, he could have
made nine times that amount, ten times.

215
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:18,172
I said to Scottie
the same thing I'd said to Michael.

216
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:20,055
"If I were you,
I wouldn't sign this contract.

217
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,717
You may be selling yourself too short.

218
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,053
It's too long a contract
you're locking yourself in for."

219
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:29,183
I felt like I couldn't afford
to gamble myself

220
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:32,394
getting injured
and not being able to provide.

221
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:39,026
I needed to make sure that people
in my corner were taken care of.

222
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:44,114
He did take care of my dad and my mom,
and he built them a house.

223
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,408
He sent 'em money every month
and everything.

224
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,660
They were taken care of.

225
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,288
I don't know nothing
that I need or want.

226
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:54,500
Some of the things
I don't have to ask him for.

227
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:58,337
So I feel like he love me.

228
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:01,131
I know I love him.

229
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:09,098
He signed a long-term deal
and it was undervalued pretty quickly.

230
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,767
The league took off, you know,

231
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,603
revenues went way, way up,
salaries went up.

232
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:20,734
Jerry Reinsdorf was emphatic about it
when guys signed a contract.

233
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,361
I don't want to hear from you again.

234
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,446
Don't come back in here,
try to renegotiate.

235
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,283
It was embarrassing

236
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:30,160
because he was
maybe the number-two player in the NBA.

237
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,122
His value was immense.

238
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,833
Just drop straight down,
there you go.

239
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:39,128
You know what,
I'm finding it's okay on this one,

240
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,797
but on my other, my patella doesn't...

241
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,966
<i>When we got to '97 and '98,</i>

242
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,635
<i>that was the last year
of Scottie's contract,</i>

243
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:51,473
I know he was very frustrated,
because Scottie needed to get paid.

244
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,808
He deserved to get paid.

245
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:58,022
There was a lot of, uh,
anger from Scottie.

246
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:01,400
He'd been one of the best players
in the game for many years.

247
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,152
He had done so much for the Bulls.

248
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:06,822
So his frustration bubbled over.

249
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,199
The world champs
making news this week.

250
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:12,244
Scottie Pippen of the Bulls will be out
for two to three months.

251
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:15,372
Pippen underwent surgery Monday
on a sore foot in New York.

252
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,082
It's an injury that's been bothering him

253
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,460
dating back to the
Eastern Conference Finals.

254
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:22,922
I had a ruptured tendon
in my ankle

255
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:26,342
and I decided to have surgery late

256
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,887
because I was, like, "You know what?

257
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:36,185
I'm not gonna fuck my summer up
trying to rehab for a season, you know?

258
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:39,563
They're not gonna be looking forward
to having me.

259
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:44,318
So, I'mma enjoy my summer,
and I'll use the season to prepare."

260
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:46,278
Scottie was wrong
in that scenario.

261
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:50,032
He could have got his surgery done
as soon as the season was over,

262
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,617
and be ready for the season.

263
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:55,496
What Scottie was trying to do
was trying to force management

264
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,790
to change his contract.

265
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:00,584
And Jerry wasn't gonna do that.

266
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:08,550
So, now I gotta start the season knowing
that Scottie wasn't gonna be around.

267
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,637
But we have to find a way to win.

268
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:15,849
How do you carry this team, now,
November and December without Scottie?

269
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,518
I think we have to do it collectively.

270
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,721
I don't think one individual's
gonna be able to do it.

271
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,815
I think, uh, we as a team,
that's what a team is all about,

272
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:25,234
so we have
to cover up for Scottie not being here.

273
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,861
We know he's not here,
but that don't mean we stop playing.

274
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,073
<i>Our Chicago Bulls
without Scottie Pippen,</i>

275
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,866
<i>and they apparently missed him tonight.</i>

276
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:38,455
<i>The Atlanta Hawks
beat the Bulls here in Atlanta.</i>

277
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,082
<i>The final score, 80-78.</i>

278
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:44,670
<i>This is going to be
the worst setback for the Chicago Bulls.</i>

279
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:47,965
<i>Cavaliers beat up the Chicago Bulls...</i>

280
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,550
<i>Again, it is still early,</i>

281
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,552
<i>but four and four for the Bulls
out of the gate.</i>

282
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:53,846
<i>Have not
scored 100 points yet this season.</i>

283
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:01,729
We're not playing with much continuity
and much rhythm

284
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:04,481
and that's something
that Scottie really provides for us.

285
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:07,943
Scottie was so key for our team.
He tied us together in many ways.

286
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:13,198
And when you're a really good team,
one loss feels like five.

287
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:16,452
You're just... You're expected to win,
you're supposed to win.

288
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:20,080
And so, early in that season,
we were losing games

289
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:22,041
and it felt like trouble.

290
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,545
<i>As time expires,
the Phoenix Suns</i>

291
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:32,176
<i>have hung on for a dramatic victory
over the Chicago Bulls.</i>

292
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:40,100
Scottie could've had
surgery after the season ended.

293
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,142
Yes.

294
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:44,646
He purposely did this late
to thumb his nose at management.

295
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,565
Were you frustrated
by how he handled this?

296
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,358
No, I wasn't.

297
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:52,237
You have to understand players' mentality
and where they're coming from,

298
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,573
and some guys can handle it,
some guys can't.

299
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:58,577
And Scottie probably needed to have this

300
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,121
to feel like
he justified what his salary was.

301
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:05,375
So I stayed solid, said,
"We're gonna survive this, we'll be fine.

302
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:06,543
We'll go forward."

303
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:10,005
That's one of the things
that Phil was really good at,

304
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,759
is managing distractions and keeping
us focused on what we had to do.

305
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:15,636
<i>Scottie's on a different timetable.</i>

306
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,429
<i>Gonna be a bumpy road till he gets back,</i>

307
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,723
<i>but we gotta manage without him
for right now.</i>

308
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:23,811
<i>When it came down to it,
this burden always fell on Michael.</i>

309
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,231
And he welcomed it, in a lot of respects.

310
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,691
He liked that.
He liked to take the responsibility.

311
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:33,946
I'm gearing myself up physically,
to deal with whatever I have to deal with.

312
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,469
I'm looking forward to it, actually.

313
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:40,577
Michael wanted to be
the best player on the best team.

314
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:45,207
Scottie's not here
but we're still better than this.

315
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,377
<i>I was trying to get the guys
to understand it from my standpoint.</i>

316
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,007
<i>Scottie was out.
My voice had to be the loudest.</i>

317
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:59,012
<i>I let my anger motivate
the players by saying,</i>

318
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,515
<i>"I want this! Do you guys want it?"</i>

319
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,184
He's raising his voice
and calling guys out.

320
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,228
<i>"You gotta rebound better, box out.</i>

321
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:09,314
<i>We're not playing well as a team.
Defensively, we're lazy."</i>

322
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:13,235
You know what he does? You sit back
and wait. What are you waiting for?

323
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,638
Waiting on the double team.

324
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:17,739
Why? You play aggressive,
they'll come and help you?

325
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:21,493
He's not worried about hurting feelings.
If he did, you could leave.

326
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:25,455
He would gladly tell you, "Get out.
We don't need you here. Get out."

327
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,958
Fuckin' Harp,
what you waitin' all day for?

328
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,752
- You think we can't cope?
- We got time.

329
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:33,463
Toni, it's okay.

330
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:34,756
You know why?

331
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,758
'Cause I got to scream at you all day.

332
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,846
<i>Every day
that Scottie wasn't playing</i>

333
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:43,223
<i>gave someone else the confidence
that they could beat us.</i>

334
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,307
Hey!

335
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:47,686
And if you're trying to maintain
dominance over people,

336
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:50,564
you don't want to give them
a chance to gain confidence.

337
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:55,402
<i>So that drove my energy.
Let's get this thing rolling.</i>

338
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:58,631
Let's go out and get our first win.
I ain't gonna say this shit again.

339
00:19:58,655 --> 00:19:59,823
Let's do it.

340
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,201
- What time is it?
- Game time!

341
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:06,955
<i>This Bull team
fired up tonight, really wants to get off</i>

342
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,793
<i>this 0-4 start on the road.
Embarrassing for such a good team.</i>

343
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:15,088
<i>The Bulls in their road blacks.
The Clippers are home white.</i>

344
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:19,051
They play the Clippers, who were a joke,

345
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:20,802
the worst team in the league.

346
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:25,265
And yet, the dregs of the league
took the Bulls to two overtimes.

347
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:28,769
Jordan kept waiting
for somebody else to help him,

348
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:30,437
and nobody else would help.

349
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:35,692
For that game, he went somewhere
and he found a switch.

350
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,213
<i>And the answer to the question,</i>

351
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,529
<i>"Is Michael Jordan tired?"</i>

352
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,156
<i>- No.
- No.</i>

353
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:45,244
<i>Jordan had to score 49
for them to win that game.</i>

354
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,639
<i>No question,
we saw greatness here tonight.</i>

355
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:50,666
<i>The Bulls win
for the first time on the road, 111-102.</i>

356
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,502
<i>Jordan finishes with a mere 49 points.</i>

357
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:56,713
We've had opportunities to win, you know,

358
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:59,258
in all the games on the road
except for Cleveland.

359
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:02,386
Hopefully, we can build upon this.
We can finish games on the road.

360
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:06,223
We've been in those games.
And we really needed a win like this.

361
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:10,310
Jordan was really worn out.
Worn out physically, worn out emotionally.

362
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:14,439
Good job, bro. Way to finish, man.

363
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:16,566
Did I have a choice?

364
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:22,364
- Anyway, Michael, hope you like the story.
- Thank you.

365
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:29,830
<i>My innate personality
is to win at all costs.</i>

366
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:32,040
<i>If I have to do it myself,
I'm gonna do it.</i>

367
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,836
Excuse us, please. Excuse us. Excuse us.

368
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:38,797
<i>Every time I step
on that basketball court,</i>

369
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,008
<i>my focus is to win the game.</i>

370
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:43,135
Excuse us, please.

371
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,012
Step back.

372
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:48,223
It drives me insane when I can't.

373
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,522
<i>As you get older, you look back</i>

374
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:58,233
<i>and you understand how you became
the person you are.</i>

375
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:01,278
<i>I don't think I would be here without</i>

376
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,697
<i>the lessons that I learned
at a very young age.</i>

377
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:07,951
<i>That competitiveness within me
started when I was a kid.</i>

378
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,599
My parents provided us

379
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:33,935
with all the opportunities
to succeed in life.

380
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:38,607
My father worked at General Electric.
My mother worked at the banks.

381
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:42,694
As a black person growing up
in Wilmington,

382
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:46,281
we were trying to make our...
our own footsteps.

383
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:50,702
As a family, we were naturally tough.
My father was tough, my mom was tough,

384
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:53,914
and the environment they brought
us in was a tough environment.

385
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:56,958
You get knocked down, you gotta get up.

386
00:22:57,042 --> 00:23:00,003
And you always give it your best
and you always try to win.

387
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,255
We hated to lose.

388
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:06,635
Mr. Jordan and myself always
tried to share with them,

389
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,970
"Don't wait for somebody
to give you something.

390
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:12,307
You're strong, you're intelligent,
go out and earn it and work for it."

391
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:16,603
We had five kids and both the wife and I,
both worked and, uh...

392
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:19,731
we would worry, at times,
about the kids being home

393
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:23,193
so we thought something we could do
was get them involved in sports.

394
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:25,487
Drop them off
at the Little League field or the gym

395
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,322
and keep 'em involved in the community.

396
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:31,660
My parents were trying
to keep me busy.

397
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:36,498
They always wanted all of us
to play organized sports

398
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:39,126
so that we learn more about life.

399
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:43,171
At the time, you had racism
all over North Carolina,

400
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,215
all over, you know, the United States.

401
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,467
And there was a lot of it around there.

402
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:52,139
So, as a kid, it was like,
"Okay, this is where I don't want to be.

403
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:54,224
I want to excel outside of this."

404
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:58,061
So my motivation was to be something
outside of Wilmington.

405
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:01,481
For me, it became athletics.

406
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:05,569
We used to compete
an awful lot in the backyard.

407
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:10,866
My brothers hated losing
but not on the same level like me,

408
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:14,035
because if you beat me back then,
we had to fight.

409
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,829
And that's just the way I was.

410
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,623
They were so competitive
between the two of 'em.

411
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:22,127
Matter of fact, at that time,
it might be said

412
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,337
that Larry was the best basketball player.

413
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:27,132
My father pushed, he pushed everybody.

414
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:31,052
And he had the tendency, if he felt
you weren't doing the best you could,

415
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:33,972
he would find a way to push you harder.

416
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:35,765
And that really drove Michael,

417
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:37,726
because Larry was pretty good
at quite a bit.

418
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:40,979
I don't think,
from a competitive standpoint,

419
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:44,941
I would be here without
the confrontations with my brother.

420
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:48,528
When you come to blows
with someone you absolutely love...

421
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:51,490
that's igniting every fire within you.

422
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:56,369
And I always felt like I was
fighting Larry for my father's attention.

423
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,039
I'm a do-it-yourselfer around the house.

424
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:00,707
So, I could take Larry out

425
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,460
and he was fascinated
by fixing things with his hands.

426
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:04,794
Took a lot of pride in it.

427
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:07,589
Michael would be out, you'd say,
"Give me a Phillips screwdriver."

428
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,216
He might give you a pair of pliers.

429
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,736
And I guess I was a little short patient
with him and I'd say,

430
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,512
"Get back in the house with your mom, boy.

431
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:16,223
You're never going to be anything.
Just go back with your mom."

432
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:18,975
When you're going through it,
it's traumatic,

433
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:22,854
because I want that, you know,
I want that approval.

434
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,356
I want that type of confidence.

435
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:27,067
So my determination got even greater

436
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:31,029
to be as good, if not better,
than my brother.

437
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,790
I met him in tryouts,

438
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:45,669
but there was nothing
particularly outstanding in tryouts.

439
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:47,754
He did not make the varsity team

440
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:49,673
as a sophomore.

441
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:52,801
When I got home
and I told my mother I was cut,

442
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:55,720
I was demoralized,
I didn't want to play any more sports.

443
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,931
I felt like the coach didn't like me.

444
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,143
He was devastated.
He came home upset, crying.

445
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:06,231
And we both cried, 'cause I knew he wanted
to really compete with the other guys.

446
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:11,903
My words to him was, "If you really
want it, you work hard over the summer."

447
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,197
And he did that summer.

448
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:19,286
He focused, he would practice all day.
That basketball never left his hand.

449
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:21,246
If you wanna bring out
the best in Michael,

450
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:22,581
tell him he can't do something.

451
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:25,375
Or he can't do it
as good as somebody else and, uh,

452
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:29,254
I think that he takes it as
a personal challenge to go out and do it,

453
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:30,547
just to prove you wrong.

454
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:36,052
Mike's improvement from his sophomore year
to his junior year was tremendous.

455
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,513
A lot of it had to do with his size.

456
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:42,809
He was about 5'10" or 5'11".
He came back about 6'3" that fall.

457
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:45,746
He had great guard skills.
He always played guard.

458
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,314
He always handled the ball.

459
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:49,482
And now becoming, you know, 6'3 ", 6'4",

460
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:52,777
that just made him
into a much better ball player.

461
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:56,740
We knew that he was special.

462
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:01,536
The athletic director of Hanover County
Schools called us and said,

463
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,289
"I've got a guy down here
I think may have a chance."

464
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:06,207
And that was Mike Jordan.

465
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:10,128
And so we invited him
to our basketball camp.

466
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:15,133
When he got here, we knew of him,
we'd heard he's pretty good.

467
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,800
Five days later, when he left, we thought
he was the best player in America.

468
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:48,722
It was the third game
of the season in the second season.

469
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:52,629
We're playing Golden State.
I go up for a lob...

470
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:54,712
<i>Bulls on the run to Michael Jordan...</i>

471
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:57,801
...and when I landed,
I landed flat-footed.

472
00:27:57,884 --> 00:28:00,428
<i>Looks like Michael
came out limping a little bit.</i>

473
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:03,973
<i>He's a little ginger on that ankle.
He had hurt it a little earlier.</i>

474
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:09,270
When they did the CAT scan,
it was a clear break, and...

475
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,022
I was done.

476
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:14,067
Last year's Rookie of the Year
Michael Jordan

477
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,568
out with a broken left foot.

478
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:20,865
I was devastated
because I never got hurt.

479
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:24,494
I'm in a cast. I couldn't do anything.
I was anxious.

480
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,747
I'm pretty sure
I was irritable to a lot of people.

481
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:31,876
He broke this bone,
right in the middle.

482
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,504
It's an area of the body

483
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:38,967
that may not heal very rapidly
because of the poor blood supply.

484
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:44,264
The healing time can vary from six weeks,
12 weeks or even longer.

485
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:46,933
And occasionally,
that fracture does not heal.

486
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:50,437
Michael had never missed
a game, through high school,

487
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,815
college and the NBA, so far.

488
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:56,151
All of a sudden, he misses 64.

489
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:59,988
I'm doing nothing,
watching games, sitting on the bench.

490
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:02,741
My mother and father came up
and spent a lot of time.

491
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:06,286
You could not keep him
on that bench.

492
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:10,039
Mr. Jordan and myself is saying,
"Michael, you are not ready."

493
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:14,127
He said, "I don't think you can tell me.
I know when my body's ready."

494
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,795
"The doctor knows when you're ready."

495
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:19,048
I was itching to do something.

496
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,134
So...

497
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,971
I talked the Bulls into letting me
go back to college.

498
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:29,267
I just started going to the gym, shooting.

499
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,561
Then I started playing one-on-one,

500
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:34,814
and then I started playing two-on-two,
then I started playing three-on-three.

501
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:38,359
Next, I was playing five-on-five,
and the Bulls never knew I was doing it.

502
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:42,572
And when I got back with the Bulls...

503
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:50,997
my calf muscles in my injured calf
were stronger than my uninjured calf.

504
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,500
So the first thing they said,
"What the hell you been doing?

505
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:54,626
Blah blah blah."

506
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:57,629
No, we didn't really know he was playing
until he came back and told us.

507
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:59,005
When Michael came back, he said,

508
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:01,568
"I've been playing an hour and a half
a day for the last week."

509
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,176
And after my heart dropped out,

510
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:05,303
I just dropped down
and, oh, my God.

511
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:09,390
I gradually worked my way up to a point
where I'm playing five-on-five in a game.

512
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:14,270
And I got the confidence that the foot
is completely healed and I can play on it.

513
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:19,609
Michael asked, "If I play, what percentage
is there that I'm gonna get hurt again?"

514
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:21,569
Doctor said, "10%."

515
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:24,864
And I just lost it.
I said, "Look, it's 10% chance,

516
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:27,200
but it's 90% chance that I won't."

517
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:29,744
And then I chimed in to the doctors,

518
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:32,163
"What happens if the 10% kicks in?"

519
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:34,582
And they said,
"Then his career would be over."

520
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,001
Well, everybody's just thinking
about the negative.

521
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:40,922
While I think the glass is half full,
everybody's thinking it's half empty.

522
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:45,677
So, I said to Michael, "You're not
understanding the risk-reward ratio.

523
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:50,306
If you had a terrible headache
and I gave you a bottle of pills,

524
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:54,018
and nine of the pills would cure you
and one of the pills would kill you,

525
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,271
would you take a pill?"

526
00:30:57,021 --> 00:31:00,233
I look at him and I said, "Depends on
how fucking bad the headache is."

527
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,777
From Jerry Reinsdorf's perspective,

528
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:06,447
a pure business decision,
you don't play the guy.

529
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:09,868
Here's your franchise.
Literally, your franchise.

530
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:12,954
In my mind, he should not risk coming back

531
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,915
because we weren't winning
a championship anyway.

532
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:19,043
Why even take a 10% risk
that your career is going to be over?

533
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,336
He didn't see it that way.

534
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:24,507
I'm starting to think,
"Well, maybe it's not me playing,

535
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:26,509
as opposed to us trying to lose games

536
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:28,428
so we can move into the lottery."

537
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:30,364
Is there something
to this business

538
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,408
of wanting a better position?
Getting in the lottery?

539
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:34,809
I hope not.
That just shows a losing attitude

540
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:38,104
and not just on the team,
but in the front office also.

541
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:40,189
We should always go out and try to win.

542
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:42,650
<i>Exasperated Bulls owner
Jerry Reinsdorf</i>

543
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,527
<i>finally agreed to a compromise</i>

544
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,112
<i>which would allow his star to play</i>

545
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:48,573
<i>a specified number of minutes
in each game.</i>

546
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:51,409
We reached a compromise
and we allowed him to come back

547
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:53,244
and play seven minutes each half.

548
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:54,954
So they let me go back and play,

549
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:57,165
and then
they put a time restriction on me.

550
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:01,233
<i>Jordan with ten points
in limited playing time.</i>

551
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:05,256
They had him on seven minute
per half time limit, with a stopwatch.

552
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:07,842
<i>Short.</i>

553
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:11,304
<i>That counts for Michael!</i>

554
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:15,224
He could be almost in mid-shot,
it's like... tweet.

555
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:18,645
"Jordan, you're out."

556
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:20,772
<i>Michael Jordan sat down.</i>

557
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,568
<i>He doesn't seem happy.
He's fired up and ready to go.</i>

558
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:27,403
<i>They're gonna have to hold him back.</i>

559
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:31,131
What was the rationale
for the seven minutes per half?

560
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:35,203
Well, we felt that the doctors had said
a certain amount of time.

561
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:38,539
We felt we were gonna try
to make the odds right

562
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,875
in a situation
where we would reduce the odds.

563
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:43,878
At the time,
the coach was Stan Albeck.

564
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:47,090
So, I said, "Stan, fuck these guys, man.

565
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:50,885
Give me the most important seven minutes
that you can think about."

566
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:55,765
So, now we start winning and we start
getting into the playoff picture.

567
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:58,977
We get to a pivotal game.

568
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:02,271
We go and play Indiana in Indiana.

569
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:06,150
We need this game because it puts us
in a position to make the playoffs.

570
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:11,447
Stan got berated,
saying, "If you put him in one second

571
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:14,117
more than 14 minutes,
you're fired on the spot."

572
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,160
<i>Jordan around an Oakley screen,</i>

573
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:17,870
<i>lean-in jumper, left baseline, is in...</i>

574
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:21,833
For 14 minutes,
I just go absolutely ballistic.

575
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,627
And we were in a position to win.

576
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:26,921
<i>On the drive,
in from the left,</i>

577
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,382
<i>Eighteen-footer good.
Bulls have the lead...</i>

578
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:32,635
<i>Outside, Richardson, right side, Fleming,
20-footer, good!</i>

579
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:38,599
<i>Thirty-one seconds left.
The Bulls take time. Down one...</i>

580
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:41,102
All of a sudden, my time is up.

581
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:43,688
I don't know if Jerry came down
from the stands to say,

582
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:46,566
"Get him out of the game."
There's, like, 30 seconds left.

583
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:48,443
<i>Thirty-one seconds to go.</i>

584
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,029
<i>Michael's time is up.</i>

585
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:53,281
I'm just like... I'm angry.

586
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:56,409
<i>What a sensational performance...</i>

587
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:58,369
Michael saw it for what it was.

588
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:01,956
You play the game to win. Period.

589
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,876
"I don't want to hear about
your draft pick.

590
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:07,128
I don't want to hear about
missing the playoffs

591
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:08,463
and how good that would be.

592
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:10,631
That's not how you play the game."

593
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,593
I'm begging Stan, "Put me in the game.

594
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:17,472
Come on, there's only
14 fuckin' seconds, Stan... 13 seconds.

595
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:19,140
Put me in for 13 seconds."

596
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,559
He said, "MJ, I can't put you in.
I'll lose my job."

597
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:24,395
It fueled the whole theory that,

598
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,481
here, we're trying
to not make the playoffs

599
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:27,940
so we can get a better draft pick.

600
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,568
But I vowed
to make the playoffs every year,

601
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:32,862
and this is a chance for us
to make the playoffs.

602
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:38,284
It's our ball, there's 13 seconds left.

603
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:44,123
Lo and behold,
John Paxson hits a game-winning shot.

604
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:47,043
<i>Pax comes down
with a jumping one-hander...</i>

605
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:49,712
Fortunately, I get lucky
and throw some shot in

606
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,380
and we end up winning the game.

607
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:55,468
<i>The Bulls win it!
The Bulls hang on and win by one!</i>

608
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:58,721
<i>What a big victory by the Bulls!</i>

609
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,072
We went into the locker room...

610
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,935
Stan locked that door.

611
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:07,188
And Jerry Krause came, wanting to get in
at the end of the game

612
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,791
and Stan wouldn't let him in.

613
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:09,816
You know, it was...

614
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:10,942
It was...

615
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:14,695
It wasn't a good...
It wasn't a good situation.

616
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:19,075
The mistrust Michael had
with management,

617
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:20,910
specifically with Jerry Krause,

618
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:26,666
was he believed that they violated
the most fundamental aspect of sport,

619
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:29,460
of, I would argue,
the most fundamental aspect

620
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,462
of the way Michael conducted his life.

621
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:35,383
You do it at the highest level
and you do it to win, all the time.

622
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:38,386
From that moment on,

623
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:43,766
Michael's relationship with the ownership
and management was deeply soured.

624
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:45,935
That never went away.

625
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:51,274
<i>No one could limit the power
and the glory of Michael Jordan.</i>

626
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:54,569
<i>The Bulls made a late-season rush
into a playoff berth,</i>

627
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,654
<i>which, ironically, cost them a chance</i>

628
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:59,490
<i>at one of the first seven choices
in next year's draft.</i>

629
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,214
We end up making the playoffs having a...

630
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:03,720
I believe we won only 30 games
in the regular season that year.

631
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:04,829
We end up the eighth seed.

632
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:10,293
Jordan essentially wills his team,
with a losing record, into the playoffs.

633
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,003
And what is their reward?

634
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:15,006
Well, they get to play
the almighty Boston Celtics

635
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:18,009
with four guys
who'd make the Hall of Fame.

636
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:23,806
We had Parish, McHale and Walton.

637
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:29,020
All of 'em were about seven foot tall,
that could score, run, defend.

638
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:32,732
We had Danny Ainge and Dennis Johnson,
our guards, and I was a small forward.

639
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:36,652
So, we had a big team, and, uh,
we were deep, we were big,

640
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:40,323
and of all the teams I've been on, there's
no question, that was the best team.

641
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:42,658
That setting, against that team...

642
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:45,786
That's what you play for,
you get to be in those situations.

643
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,015
<i>The Celtics
have won 31 in a row at home.</i>

644
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:52,043
<i>They beat Chicago six times this year
in the regular season.</i>

645
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:55,338
Michael had this supreme confidence
about him.

646
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:56,839
He loved the big stage.

647
00:36:56,923 --> 00:37:00,134
This is the opportunity to play
against Larry Bird and the Celtics.

648
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,053
Man, this is showtime.

649
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:04,555
Well, Michael was coming off
a pretty serious injury

650
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,098
and we didn't know what to expect.

651
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:09,143
Michael Jordan is back and there are
no limits to his playing time.

652
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,187
He's really ready to cut loose.

653
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:13,481
<i>We're ready to go
at the Boston Garden.</i>

654
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:16,651
They took all the limitations off
and it was like unleashing

655
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,444
a wild dog.

656
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:21,322
<i>Jordan hangs in the air,
puts it down.</i>

657
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:24,158
<i>Jordan, shot it from the baseline.</i>

658
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:27,411
<i>Jordan changed it in midair.
Got it, nonetheless.</i>

659
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:31,290
Our whole thing was just,
"Do what we can do to hold Michael down."

660
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:33,417
But you don't hold the great ones down.

661
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:37,171
<i>Michael Jordan wheels,
fades, off-balance...</i>

662
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,965
<i>Absolutely amazing!</i>

663
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:40,758
<i>Jordan beats Dennis.</i>

664
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:44,971
<i>Carlisle has the unenviable task
of playing Jordan.</i>

665
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:47,473
<i>Isn't that something?</i>

666
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:51,352
<i>I mean,
Carlisle just wants his mommy.</i>

667
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,982
<i>Jordan with great anticipation.
He's off to the races.</i>

668
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:57,316
<i>Watch this! Whoo-hoo!</i>

669
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,237
We had a lot of guys in our league
that could score a lot of points.

670
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,446
He took it to another level.

671
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,866
We stuck with the game plan,
and we end up winning the ball game.

672
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,869
<i>McHale, Bird, Parish...
And a foul...</i>

673
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,163
<i>There's the Celtics.</i>

674
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:16,752
<i>Who's your player of the game, John?</i>

675
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,671
<i>Hard to ignore
Jordan tonight.</i>

676
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:20,339
<i>We chose him as our player of the game.</i>

677
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:22,633
<i>Forty-nine points, four rebounds.</i>

678
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:25,303
<i>A spectacular individual effort
by this guy.</i>

679
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:28,389
Tough job for the Chicago team now
and for Stan Albeck,

680
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:30,016
trying to get 'em ready for game two.

681
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:31,559
They played so hard here tonight.

682
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:34,895
I remember game two. I'd played golf
with Michael the day before.

683
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:41,235
It was Michael, Danny,
Mike Carey and myself.

684
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:44,238
And Michael and Danny are giving it
to each other back and forth.

685
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:48,242
Before game two,
you played golf with Danny Ainge.

686
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:49,785
Mmm-hmm.

687
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:53,539
Get through.

688
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:56,042
I cannot hit it today.

689
00:38:56,876 --> 00:39:00,880
I took a few bucks off of Michael that day
and we're talking trash to each other.

690
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:02,798
That might have been a mistake.

691
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:06,218
Get it out.

692
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:10,598
Pissing me off, man.

693
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:14,310
We get done, we get in the car,
we drop Danny off first.

694
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,520
And, uh, Michael says,

695
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:19,190
"Tell your boy DJ
I got something for him tomorrow."

696
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,028
The first game,
the guy scores 49...

697
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:27,239
but I don't think anyone expected,

698
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:29,301
going into the next game,
what was going to happen.

699
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:36,165
<i>♪ No rapper can rap quite like I can ♪</i>

700
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:38,793
<i>♪ I'll take a musclebound man
And put his face in the sand ♪</i>

701
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:41,962
<i>♪ Not the last Mafioso, I'm a MC cop ♪</i>

702
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:45,132
<i>♪ Make you say "Go LL"
And do the wop ♪</i>

703
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,301
He was scoring at will.
Dunks, bankers.

704
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,178
He'd get in the middle
and shoot over guys.

705
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:52,348
<i>♪ Trendsetter, I'm better
My rhymes are good ♪</i>

706
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:55,476
<i>♪ I got a gold nameplate that says
"I wish you would" ♪</i>

707
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:58,270
I played practically
every minute in the second game.

708
00:39:58,354 --> 00:39:59,354
I just never stopped.

709
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:01,565
<i>On the switch.
Bird guards Jordan.</i>

710
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,025
<i>Jordan hits the jumper anyway.</i>

711
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:05,861
Stan Albeck kept putting me
in isolated situations

712
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:08,781
and I just took advantage of my youth
and my energy.

713
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:11,242
<i>Jordan uses
his quickness and it works.</i>

714
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:14,328
<i>Jordan with 31. Bullseye.</i>

715
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:20,167
<i>Jordan against Ainge, spins into the lane,
scoops the shot up and draws the foul.</i>

716
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:23,796
We all took our cracks at him that day.
It wasn't one guy.

717
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:26,257
DJ was our best defensive player,

718
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:30,010
and he picked up four fouls early
in the third quarter.

719
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,847
<i>Four fouls
on Johnson. Welcome to the club.</i>

720
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:36,392
I was on him for a while,
Danny was on him, DJ was on him a lot.

721
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:39,186
I remember laughing
in the middle of the game

722
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:42,440
because Walton was cursing me out

723
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:45,359
because he had to guard Jordan
on a few occasions.

724
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:48,154
<i>Walton with five.
Next foul and he's gone...</i>

725
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:50,197
<i>Jordan isolated one-on-one...</i>

726
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:51,822
<i>Basket...</i>

727
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:52,908
Walton fouled out.

728
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:56,579
<i>Jordan has shot
18 free throws and made 16.</i>

729
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:59,123
<i>♪ I eliminate punks
Cut 'em up in chunks ♪</i>

730
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:01,834
<i>♪ You were souped, you heard me

731
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:04,545
<i>♪ I'm devastating
I'm so good it's a shame ♪</i>

732
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:07,214
<i>♪ Cause I eat rappers like a cannibal
They call me insane ♪</i>

733
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,842
<i>♪ I'm as strong as a bull
Of course you know why I pull ♪</i>

734
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:11,886
<i>♪ I enjoy what I'm doing... ♪</i>

735
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,387
<i>Oh, my!</i>

736
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,306
<i>48 for Michael Jordan.</i>

737
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:24,815
<i>You liked 49 on Thursday.
How about 50 on Sunday?</i>

738
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,400
<i>Pull-up shot on Parish, good.</i>

739
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:27,776
<i>Fifty-two for Jordan...</i>

740
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:31,030
<i>Michael, right base-line jumper... good!
And a foul called.</i>

741
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:34,408
<i>Michael shooting for the tie
with no time left.</i>

742
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:38,787
<i>Overtime in Boston Garden!</i>

743
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:40,623
<i>Jordan hits it. Fifty-six for Jordan.</i>

744
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:45,461
<i>Sixty-one points to tie all-time
single-game playoff record...</i>

745
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:47,671
<i>Got it! Sixty-three for Jordan!</i>

746
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:50,966
<i>A new NBA record has been set
in the Boston Garden.</i>

747
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,635
It was a high-scoring game.

748
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:55,012
Fortunately for us, we had the last shot.

749
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,806
<i>Bird, pick and roll
to Parish.</i>

750
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:03,896
<i>And a hard-fought victory
for the Boston Celtics</i>

751
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:05,397
<i>to take a 2-0 lead.</i>

752
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:09,026
We were fortunate to win that game,
but Michael put on a show.

753
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:11,153
<i>Our Miller Lite
most valuable player</i>

754
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:12,905
<i>of the game is Michael Jordan,</i>

755
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:17,409
<i>with an all-time record 63 points
in a single playoff game.</i>

756
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:18,933
We end up winning the series,

757
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:22,331
but it was an incredible,
incredible playoff performance.

758
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:26,043
I've never seen it before
and I had never seen it after.

759
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:29,463
That wasn't Michael Jordan out there.
That was God disguised as Michael Jordan.

760
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:35,344
Nobody like him.

761
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:37,721
Point blank.
I never seen nobody play like he plays,

762
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:40,849
and, uh, you can include all of 'em.

763
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:44,937
Jordan is the most talented player
in the NBA...

764
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:48,190
uh, by far.

765
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:50,693
Guys like myself and Larry,
who knew the game,

766
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:53,279
who knew championship basketball,

767
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:55,990
we knew the guy was coming. Right?

768
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:59,660
He just needed the right horses
to go along with him.

769
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:02,997
We realized
that Michael Jordan

770
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,291
was the greatest ball player in the NBA.

771
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:09,253
So, a year later,
we basically rebuilt the entire team.

772
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:11,046
Krause went to work.

773
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:15,551
We added some great people
like Horace Grant and Scottie Pippen.

774
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:19,054
We changed the makeup of the team.

775
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:25,728
I will always give Jerry Krause
credit for assembling a roster that fit.

776
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:29,398
I'm sure one of the hardest trades
he ever had to make

777
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:32,109
was trading Charles Oakley to New York
for Bill Cartwright.

778
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,946
We needed a big man.
So, Bill was a great fit.

779
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,032
As much as I love Charles,

780
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,743
this fits us better than
what Charles gives us right now.

781
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:44,121
Michael was very fond of Charles
'cause Charles was his protector.

782
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:47,082
Mike was always attacking the basket
and he got knocked down a lot,

783
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:49,209
and Charles was always the guy
to back him up.

784
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:51,879
<i>Oakley going
right after "Hot Rod" Williams.</i>

785
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,923
When Krause pulled
the trigger on that trade,

786
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,676
that was probably
one of the defining things in his career.

787
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:00,262
Charles Oakley and I
were good friends.

788
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:02,139
We'd spent a lot of time together.

789
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:06,268
But things were in place for us to win,
you know, when he left.

790
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:09,188
Jerry did a phenomenal job
with the team.

791
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:12,691
He made great trades,
made great free agent signings.

792
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:14,234
He deserves a lot of credit.

793
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,403
But he couldn't get out of his own way.

794
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:38,384
Scottie had problems with Jerry and, um,

795
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:41,178
it came out on several occasions.

796
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:45,265
The thing was... And part of,
you know, Scottie's anger,

797
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:48,185
was they did look
into seriously trading him

798
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:50,562
after the '96-'97 season.

799
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:52,231
Anybody can be traded

800
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:54,525
and part of my responsibility

801
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:57,861
is to listen to other teams
when they talk to me about our players.

802
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:00,906
And we think Scottie Pippen is certainly,

803
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:02,991
one of the top couple of players
in basketball,

804
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:04,493
and feel very strongly about him.

805
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:07,287
And I can't tell you
what's gonna happen in the future,

806
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:08,371
because I don't know.

807
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:15,045
Krause's point then was,
"Look, we're gonna lose Pippen in a year.

808
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:17,089
The group doesn't have that much left.

809
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,425
Let's blow it up now."

810
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:20,968
But ownership said no.

811
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:24,138
But I killed that
because I decided that

812
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:26,974
as long as Michael Jordan
was still gonna be here,

813
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:28,726
we gotta go for the sixth championship.

814
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:32,187
Jerry, how close did you come
to dealing Scottie Pippen?

815
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:35,524
Well, we had a number of offers

816
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:41,655
we thought were good offers for Scottie
and for some of our other players.

817
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:44,575
I'm never going to stop being aggressive,

818
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:48,162
and I will never stop trying to do things
to make the team better.

819
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,789
That really is what sort of...

820
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:55,419
tarnished my relationship with Jerry.

821
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:59,631
He tried to make me feel so special,

822
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:06,430
but yet, he was still, like,
willing to trade and do all that stuff,

823
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:10,100
but never would tell me to my face.

824
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,437
<i>After you're in the game for a while,</i>

825
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,565
<i>you realize that nobody is untradeable,</i>

826
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:19,943
<i>but I felt insulted.</i>

827
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:26,658
I sort of took the attitude
of disrespecting him to some degree.

828
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:32,623
There was always barbs
going back and forth,

829
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:35,250
but at a certain point,
Scottie crossed a line.

830
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:39,546
I mean, it was getting... personal.

831
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:45,511
Pippen started abusing Krause openly,
cursing him out on the bus.

832
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:49,431
Couldn't tolerate him anymore.
Didn't respect him.

833
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:54,353
I remember some shots coming
from the back of the bus.

834
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,481
Raise your eyebrows, you know.

835
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:04,238
Pippen started berating Jerry Krause...

836
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:06,824
in front of the team.

837
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:12,746
We had to say, "Hey, let's hold it down."
You know?

838
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,999
But that's when it was, like,
"Hey, there's a divide here."

839
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:20,462
It's not your normal...
I mean, there's some hard feelings.

840
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:22,256
"You don't appreciate me.

841
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:24,508
You're trying to trade me.
You won't pay me.

842
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:27,761
Well, screw you.
I'm taking care of myself now."

843
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:33,225
I was at that point where I felt
like I needed to do what was best for me.

844
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:37,396
I felt like it was time for me
to go shopping.

845
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:40,190
Pippen is now demanding a trade
and he says

846
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:43,861
he will not return from the injured list
until he is gone from Chicago.

847
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:46,363
He said he's never gonna play
for the Bulls ever again.

848
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:48,448
"I'm never gonna wear this uniform
ever again."

849
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:51,452
Should the Bulls do something
that would make you want to stay?

850
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:55,622
I mean, no. I don't...
I don't see myself carrying on.

851
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:59,626
Scottie made some
earth-shattering comments last night

852
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:02,588
to one of the Chicago writers,
about wanting to be traded.

853
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:06,008
- Can we get your thoughts on that?
- I don't really have any right now.

854
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:09,720
I felt like Scottie was being selfish.

855
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:12,222
Worrying about himself as opposed to

856
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:15,851
what his word was to the organization
as well as to the team.

857
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:20,063
I'm done here,
you know what I'm saying?

858
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:24,359
You've already written my script out
that this is it.

859
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:27,988
So, I had to do what was best for me.
