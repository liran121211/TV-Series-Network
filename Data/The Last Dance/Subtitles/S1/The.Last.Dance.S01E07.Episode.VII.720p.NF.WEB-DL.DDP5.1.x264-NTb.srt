1
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:20,061
Are you surprised
the team has stayed together

2
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:21,396
and the chemistry has been good

3
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:24,315
with the backstabbing between you
and coach and everything else?

4
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:29,154
First of all, there's no backstabbing
going on here, okay?

5
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:32,699
Okay? You understand me when I say that?

6
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:35,535
There's no backstabbing
going on here, okay?

7
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:37,620
Second, no, I'm not surprised at all.

8
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:40,749
And I'm amazed that you would
even make a statement like that,

9
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:44,335
but I'm not surprised at all because
this team is composed of professionals.

10
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:48,840
It's composed of guys who understand
what they have to do and who are winners,

11
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:51,968
unlike the comment you just made.
Gentlemen, good night.

12
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:58,141
Way to go, Craig.

13
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:02,854
<i>A spectacular move!</i>

14
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:04,522
<i>The game's over!</i>

15
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,941
<i>Chicago Stadium is going wild!</i>

16
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,088
<i>First of all,
there's no backstabbing going on here.</i>

17
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:12,423
<i>It's time for me to move on.</i>

18
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:15,007
<i>This will be Phil's last year
as the coach of the Bulls.</i>

19
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:20,497
- <i>Are the expectations too high?
- Where do we go from here?</i>

20
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,540
<i>The only question:
how long can it last?</i>

21
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:34,886
<i>We're at
the United Center in Chicago,</i>

22
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:37,222
<i>opening of the NBA playoffs.</i>

23
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:39,557
<i>Tonight, game one of round one</i>

24
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:43,812
<i>and the start of a best-of-five series
against the New Jersey Nets.</i>

25
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:46,606
Michael Jordan said
to lose a game to the Nets,

26
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:50,401
lose a <i>game</i> to the Nets,
his team would have to "fall asleep."

27
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:53,780
Can that backfire on him or does that
just not happen to Superman?

28
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:56,741
These are the Bulls.
They're not worried about the Nets.

29
00:01:56,825 --> 00:02:01,496
This is a sweep. Bring the brooms out,
3-0, move on to the next series, man.

30
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,996
Come on.

31
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:06,042
Starts off with hard work,
ends in champagne. Let's start.

32
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:09,838
- What time is it?
- Game time!

33
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:17,679
The playoffs is the highest level
of competition that we have in our game.

34
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:20,932
You got 82 games in the regular season,

35
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:24,602
but you can kick all that aside.
The playoffs is the playoffs.

36
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:30,441
And to be able to play against
the best competition,

37
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,778
that was the driving force for me,
without a doubt.

38
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:52,297
<i>Opening tip,
and it'll be Bulls possession.</i>

39
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,966
<i>And Keith Van Horn
gives the Nets the lead.</i>

40
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:58,928
<i>Now, you can see the athleticism
of the New Jersey Nets early on,</i>

41
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:03,850
<i>and a shocked crowd and Phil Jackson
watches the Bulls trail by seven.</i>

42
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:08,229
<i>And here is Kerry Kittles
with a great sweeping lay-in,</i>

43
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:11,441
<i>and New Jersey have taken a 12-3 lead.</i>

44
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,237
<i>Here's Ron Harper, stuffing it through.</i>

45
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:20,325
<i>And the Bulls have come back
to trail John Calipari's Nets.</i>

46
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,202
<i>Jordan over Kittles, hits.</i>

47
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:26,080
<i>But the Nets keep coming.
Under two minutes to go, it's Gatling.</i>

48
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,791
<i>He had 24, here are two of them.</i>

49
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,044
<i>Tied at 89, we go to overtime.</i>

50
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:34,464
<i>Knocked away, stolen by Michael!
MJ on the right.</i>

51
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:38,426
<i>Michael dunks the ball and a foul! Oh, my!</i>

52
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,805
<i>And here come the Nets.
Douglas for three. At the horn.</i>

53
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,974
<i>Short. Rebound Pippen, and that'll do it.</i>

54
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,604
<i>The Bulls win it.
Not without a scare from the Nets.</i>

55
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:52,148
<i>A pretty bumpy start
for the Bulls.</i>

56
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:57,403
<i>If Friday's opener is any indication,
Chicago could be in for a long series.</i>

57
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,615
Watching this team
as they embarked on the playoffs,

58
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:03,034
you just had the feeling
that Michael Jordan

59
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:06,371
was mentally, emotionally exhausted.

60
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:11,167
He kind of looked like
the Michael Jordan of 1993.

61
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:17,090
<i>Oliver Miller plays it.
Here's Johnson.</i>

62
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:19,342
<i>Johnson gets...
No, he could not get it off.</i>

63
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,552
<i>Knocked away by Grant. It's over!</i>

64
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:26,933
<i>The Chicago Bulls have made it
three straight NBA championships!</i>

65
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,397
After we won the championship,
I sat in the gym with my father.

66
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:36,651
In the back of my mind,
I knew that was probably my last game.

67
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:39,445
And no one really knew
except for my father and myself.

68
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:45,076
He was my rock.
You know, we were very close.

69
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,912
He constantly gave me advice.

70
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:54,043
I remember in ninth grade,
I got suspended three times in one year,

71
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,130
and my father pulled me aside
that summer and said,

72
00:04:57,213 --> 00:05:00,216
"Look, you don't look like
you're headed in the right direction.

73
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:05,221
You wanna go about doing all this
mischievous stuff, you can forget sports."

74
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:08,099
That's all I needed to hear.

75
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:10,643
From that point on,
it was like tunnel vision,

76
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,812
and I never got in trouble
from that point on.

77
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,025
He had a very strong influence
on Michael's life.

78
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,902
He just was a wonderful, positive man.

79
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,698
Hey... And I feel cool with this man.

80
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,993
I wanna negotiate my contract...

81
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:30,330
If you knew Michael,
you pretty much knew James

82
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:34,125
because they were always together.
They were very close. Best friends.

83
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,627
We'd hang out before the games,

84
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:40,381
and he'd find some kid
in the stands, somewhere,

85
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:43,384
some kid that never had a chance
in the world to meet Michael Jordan.

86
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,928
When the game was over,
he'd walk that kid in the locker room.

87
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,638
The kid would be through the roof.

88
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,642
<i>James Jordan was there</i>

89
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:56,856
<i>when his son Michael led the Chicago Bulls
to their first NBA championship in 1991.</i>

90
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,485
<i>James and Deloris Jordan
remained an anchor for him.</i>

91
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,279
<i>They attended every Bulls game they could.</i>

92
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,115
<i>Around the NBA,</i>

93
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,744
<i>James Jordan relished his stand-in role
for a superstar son.</i>

94
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:12,914
To tell you how proud I am, uh...

95
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:15,333
I'd have to search for more words
than what I've got.

96
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:19,337
He's a voice of reason
that always drove and challenged me.

97
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,297
That's the type of father I had.

98
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,758
- Like a friend?
- Yeah, like a friend.

99
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,043
I had to pick up
Michael's father from the airport.

100
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:39,232
He was supposed to come into town
for a charity event Michael was throwing.

101
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:43,236
And I went to the airport to pick up
his dad, and he never showed up.

102
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:48,616
So, of course, I called his mom and said,
"Hey, Pops isn't here."

103
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:52,954
We knew he was down
at the Hilton Head house, playing golf.

104
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,124
When we didn't hear from him,
we both thought,

105
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,376
"Well, okay, they're still playing golf."

106
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,088
She said, "Well, just come on back.
Don't worry about him.

107
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:04,424
He probably got sidetracked a bit.
He'll show up."

108
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:10,596
I was off doing my thing, and my mom said
she hadn't talked to him in some time.

109
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:15,184
He drives and goes down to Wilmington
to visit old friends,

110
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:18,062
stay a couple of days, drive back,

111
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,606
but my mother's always
in dialogue with him.

112
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,695
When she got worried, we all got worried.

113
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,614
Was it unusual for him
to be out of contact?

114
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,908
Oh, yes, definitely unusual.

115
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,994
I knew something wasn't right.

116
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:38,207
James Jordan, the father
of Bulls superstar Michael Jordan,

117
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,251
has not been seen for three weeks.

118
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,130
His car was found stripped and hidden

119
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:46,883
in some woods
near Fayetteville, North Carolina.

120
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:50,636
<i>The car, a red Lexus,
was missing the license plates.</i>

121
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,931
<i>It was battered.
The windows were broken out.</i>

122
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,684
You know, we try to backtrack
what his actions were.

123
00:07:56,767 --> 00:08:00,313
He left a certain day.
He was driving back,

124
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:04,859
and just got tired. Instead of driving,
he pulled off and he just took a nap.

125
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,780
Next thing you know,
things happen the way they happen.

126
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:17,997
<i>We're coming on the air now
with word that the body of James Jordan</i>

127
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,502
<i>has been found in a creek near the border
between South and North Carolina.</i>

128
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:25,732
<i>Investigators say Jordan
was driving late at night</i>

129
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:27,590
<i>when he pulled off the road
to take a nap...</i>

130
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:30,134
And he was awakened.

131
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:34,514
And at that time,
he was shot once in the chest.

132
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,599
<i>Two 18-year-old men
are charged</i>

133
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,935
<i>with the robbery
and murder of James Jordan.</i>

134
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:41,669
<i>As for Michael Jordan,</i>

135
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,981
<i>he arrived back home today
in North Carolina.</i>

136
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:48,152
<i>Back to face the most painful moments
of an already troubled year.</i>

137
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:52,073
Meanwhile, Jordan's murder
adds another bitter twist to the dark side

138
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:53,866
of an all-American success story.

139
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,463
You know, that's just such a...

140
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:11,259
It's just such a horrible,
hard thing to talk about.

141
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:16,097
I can remember that,
flying into... North Carolina.

142
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,688
Michael couldn't tie his tie.

143
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:28,359
So I had to tie the tie for him,
and that moment was just so hard.

144
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,653
So hard of what we were there for.

145
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,659
We all were together,
and it was devastating,

146
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:40,204
but it was about support.
We had to support each other.

147
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,418
My mother was so strong.

148
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:50,423
And the first thing she says,
"You gotta be thankful."

149
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:52,675
And I started looking at the positive.

150
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:58,264
Michael's the one who got up and spoke,
and he spoke about, I think,

151
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:03,311
what a father he had been to him.
More of a father but also a friend.

152
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:06,897
He'd been there. A lot of things
he wouldn't share with anybody else,

153
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,190
he shared with his dad.

154
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:14,697
One of the things he taught me
is that you have to take a negative

155
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,115
and turn it into a positive.

156
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:20,786
So I started looking
to the other side of it,

157
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,955
and that helped me get through it.

158
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,126
When his dad was murdered,

159
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:30,546
all the articles,
the speculation that came out,

160
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,548
it was not journalism's finest hour.

161
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:37,678
The violent death sparked
a half-dozen theories about the motive,

162
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:40,139
some including possible connections
to gambling.

163
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:46,270
That was really bad.
That was really unfair.

164
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:50,107
Imagine your father gets killed
and they're blaming you?

165
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,652
That was really cheap-shot stuff.

166
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:56,781
It did hurt,

167
00:10:56,864 --> 00:11:00,493
but you had people that were throwing
darts who wanted to hurt me anyway.

168
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,912
It wasn't from the people that I loved,

169
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,955
or people that knew me
and people that care.

170
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,417
It was the people that got tired
of me being on top.

171
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,003
Basketball superstar
Michael Jordan

172
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,505
issued a statement Thursday.

173
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:15,508
He expressed that he was outraged
by some media speculation

174
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:18,052
linking his behavior
to his father's murder.

175
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:20,513
Jordan said, "I simply cannot comprehend

176
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:23,683
how others could intentionally
pour salt in my open wound

177
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:26,060
by insinuating that mistakes in my life

178
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:28,688
are in some way connected
to my father's death."

179
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,900
There isn't a thimble's worth of evidence

180
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:35,903
to connect that horrible incident

181
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,072
to Michael Jordan's gambling

182
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:40,533
or any other aspect
of Michael Jordan's behavior.

183
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:44,286
Police said it was no more
than brutality and greed,

184
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:48,207
that James Jordan
"could have been any one of us."

185
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,544
What is still unclear
and will be for some time

186
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:54,046
is what effect this tragedy
will have on Michael Jordan

187
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,923
and his future with the Chicago Bulls.

188
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:58,342
Basketball?
Haven't thought about basketball.

189
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:01,887
I didn't think about basketball
before all this happened, so, uh...

190
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:05,641
Right now, everything's tentative
for my schedule from this point on.

191
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,770
David Falk came over to me
at a charity dinner

192
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,313
that was sponsored by Michael,

193
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:15,151
and said, "You're not gonna believe this,
but Michael wants to retire."

194
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,403
I said, "I don't believe it."

195
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:22,158
At that time, we were coming off
of three championships.

196
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,327
I fulfilled my responsibility
to the city,

197
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:28,372
to the Bulls, to my teammates.

198
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,959
I did not try to talk him out of it,
but I did say to him,

199
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:34,962
"You can't make a final decision
until you talk to Phil."

200
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:36,525
Where was that meeting?

201
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,884
Reinsdorf's office in the Berto Center.

202
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,611
- Just the two of you?
- Yeah.

203
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:45,055
When I told Phil, I said,
"Look, I'm about here. I'm about done.

204
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:48,100
I have no more challenges,
I have no motivation."

205
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,393
I was done.

206
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:54,565
This was... a young man that'd
gone through some heart-rending things.

207
00:12:54,648 --> 00:13:00,237
You're denying a gift to society,
but I understand.

208
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:02,823
You know, I understand.

209
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:09,371
<i>Game one of the
American League Championship Series</i>

210
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,833
<i>as the Chicago White Sox greet
the world champion Toronto Blue Jays.</i>

211
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,294
Michael was scheduled
to throw out the first pitch.

212
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:18,631
<i>He threw out the first pitch
of game one of the ALCS.</i>

213
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:21,634
<i>Then he went up into a private box
with his family.</i>

214
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:25,137
<i>I'm watching a White Sox
playoff game</i>

215
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,722
<i>in Comiskey Park.</i>

216
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,246
<i>A kid comes up and says,
"Mr. Reinsdorf wants to talk to you."</i>

217
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:32,770
<i>So I went up and I grab Jerry and,
"What's up?"</i>

218
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,815
<i>He said, "Michael's quitting."
I said, "What?</i>

219
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:39,318
<i>No, no. What's up? Don't joke with me,
that's serious stuff."</i>

220
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,153
<i>He said, "No, he's quitting, Jerr."</i>

221
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,072
That game was a Tuesday,

222
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,574
and I wanted to hold the story
until Wednesday,

223
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:47,243
but it leaked out.

224
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,369
Breaking story here.

225
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:51,622
The Chicago Bulls have called
a press conference for tomorrow morning,

226
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:53,791
and there's high speculation and a report

227
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:57,670
that Michael Jordan will retire
from basketball forever.

228
00:13:57,753 --> 00:14:01,215
So, all hell broke out at the ballpark
on a Tuesday night.

229
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,761
Media trying to get into my box
to get to Michael. It was wild.

230
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:09,557
<i>Michael decided
to exit stage left in the seventh inning.</i>

231
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,768
<i>Jordan speeding away
from Comiskey Park without comment.</i>

232
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,652
Did Michael
talk to you about it?

233
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,773
<i>So, too, Chicago Bulls owner
Jerry Reinsdorf.</i>

234
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,233
Before we continue tonight,

235
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:21,443
a late-breaking story
of enormous interest.

236
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:24,446
A shocking revelation tonight
for all Chicagoans.

237
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,615
Sources with the Chicago Bulls
have confirmed

238
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,660
that Michael Jordan will announce
his retirement effective immediately

239
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:31,412
at a Wednesday morning press conference.

240
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:34,123
CBS News will carry
Michael Jordan's announcement live.

241
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:38,043
Our coverage will begin this morning
at 11 o'clock Eastern time.

242
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,462
Allison, this is the ultimate
press conference.

243
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,173
Every cameraman and reporter
I've ever known in this business

244
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:46,844
from all parts of the country,
from Dick Schaap to Tom Brokaw,

245
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:49,013
to everyone here waiting for the arrival

246
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:52,016
of players, Michael Jordan, his entourage
and the Bulls management...

247
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:53,726
Whether you agree or not

248
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:57,187
that this should be the news story
of the year, it is.

249
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,940
<i>Close to 100 cameras
from around the world...</i>

250
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,358
Get ready for entry on camera.

251
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,402
<i>...and three times
as many reporters.</i>

252
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:08,073
<i>They've come from everywhere,
from the local weeklies to network news.</i>

253
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:11,035
That's a tribute to Michael Jordan's
presence in American life

254
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,704
as the greatest basketball player
who ever lived.

255
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:18,334
Here they come. Here they come.
Here he comes. Here he comes.

256
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,961
<i>Michael Jordan now...
is entering.</i>

257
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,799
<i>Here's Michael Jordan,
taking his place at the podium,</i>

258
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,509
<i>surrounded by security.</i>

259
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:31,972
<i>It's hard to overstate
the loss of Michael Jordan</i>

260
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:34,183
<i>to the National Basketball Association</i>

261
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,727
<i>and to the heartbeat
of this community of Chicago.</i>

262
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:40,064
<i>He has led this team
to three NBA championships, of course.</i>

263
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:43,192
<i>The superstar's frequently
the talk of the town.</i>

264
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:46,862
<i>This time, the talk is more like
a chorus of mourning.</i>

265
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,281
<i>Michael all smiles.</i>

266
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:52,743
<i>Jerry Reinsdorf, Phil Jackson,
Jerry Krause.</i>

267
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:56,080
<i>NBA Commissioner David Stern
even in attendance.</i>

268
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:57,998
<i>It looks like </i>The Last Supper.

269
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,421
This is a very bittersweet day.

270
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:06,507
There's a certain sadness

271
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:10,803
because the greatest athlete to ever play
a team sport is leaving the game,

272
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,889
but it's really, for me,
a very, very happy day

273
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:17,601
because somebody who I admire
and respect...

274
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:21,230
is doing exactly what he wants to do.

275
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:25,234
And I'm absolutely convinced that
he's doing the right thing.

276
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:26,776
Michael?

277
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:30,823
Thanks, Jerry.
I'm a very optimistic person.

278
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:33,867
I guess the biggest positive thing
that I can take out of

279
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:39,498
my father not being here with me today
is that... he saw my last basketball game.

280
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:40,791
And that means a lot.

281
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,294
The word "retired" means...

282
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,631
you can do anything you want
from this day on.

283
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,384
So if I desire to come back
and play again,

284
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,378
maybe that's what I wanna do.

285
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,972
Maybe that's the challenge
I may need someday down the road.

286
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,349
I'm not gonna close that door.

287
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,353
I was at peace with that decision.

288
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,605
Totally, 100%.

289
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,483
You know, I felt ready.

290
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:16,118
Michael Jordan's retirement in 1993
was one of those seismic

291
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,955
"where were you when you
heard the news" moments.

292
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,126
And you immediately think, "Why?"

293
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:32,968
Nobody could rationalize
that Michael would just walk away.

294
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,223
There's one side of this

295
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,434
we ought to mention.
I don't wanna sound negative

296
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:46,190
but, uh, Michael did leave abruptly
in the middle of a gambling investigation.

297
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:48,734
Look at some of the events
that have recently happened.

298
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:51,445
His father was tragically murdered.

299
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:55,741
There's a number of questions
about his gambling.

300
00:17:56,992 --> 00:18:00,954
And you start to connect some dots
and you think, "Is this all related?

301
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,625
Was this a secret suspension?"

302
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,336
The retirement,
there were people who said,

303
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,379
"David Stern suspended him. Wink, wink.

304
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,090
It's suspension, right?"

305
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:14,760
And that was... It was out there.

306
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,179
You're telling me...

307
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:22,726
that David Stern, the ultimate capitalist,
takes his number one player

308
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,812
on his number one franchise,

309
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:28,357
and unilaterally decides
to lower the value

310
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,235
of the rest of the league franchises
by taking him out

311
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:33,070
and the Bulls out effectively...

312
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:34,863
um...

313
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:39,576
for some secret penalty,
and no one ever finds out about it?

314
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:43,372
What's your opinion
of the theory that

315
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:47,292
Commissioner Stern suspended Michael
for 18 months?

316
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:51,338
How can I phrase this delicately?

317
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:52,673
Total bullshit.

318
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:54,550
Can you use that?

319
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,302
Total bullshit.

320
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:01,473
There was so much speculative reporting.

321
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:04,560
Nobody had concrete facts,
nobody had anything.

322
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:10,107
The folklore, the urban legend that
I sent him away because he was gambling...

323
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:14,403
Ridiculous. It never...
No basis in fact whatever.

324
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:18,240
I could bang on the table
and say it's a calumny,

325
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:21,118
a slanderous lie or whatever.
It's just not true.

326
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:25,622
Never was and never will be, no matter
how many times people ask the question.

327
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:28,959
So Michael Jordan left
the league of his own volition in 1993?

328
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:30,294
Yes, he did.

329
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:34,464
I didn't retire
because he kicked me out

330
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:37,009
or they suspended me
for a year and a half.

331
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,553
That is not true.
There is no truth to that.

332
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:44,183
I needed a break, you know,
my father just passed and I retired.

333
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:47,269
I retired with the notion
that I wasn't going to come back.

334
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:49,396
The conspiracy stuff was stupid

335
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:53,442
because I had sat with him a year earlier,
and he told me what he was gonna do.

336
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,321
It was the summer of '92,
and it's the Dream Team summer.

337
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,823
You could tell he was really tired.

338
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:03,160
As tired as he looked
and as beat up as he looked,

339
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,913
I said, "So, what are you gonna do?"

340
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,225
Long pause, and he said,
"I'm gonna shock the world.

341
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:11,376
Now I'm gonna quit and go play baseball."

342
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,254
And I said, "When?"

343
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:17,758
And he said, "Well, I'd do it right now,

344
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:20,594
except Bird and Magic never won
three in a row,

345
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:22,679
and I gotta do the Olympics,

346
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:26,183
but if it wasn't for that,
I'd be playing this summer."

347
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:30,979
<i>The big top for this circus
went up at 10:45 this morning.</i>

348
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:35,400
<i>Michael went through a series of drills,
including fielding, catching and throwing.</i>

349
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,487
<i>With batting practice done,</i>

350
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:42,449
<i>MJ headed to his news conference,
and rumor became reality.</i>

351
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:47,955
Thank you all for coming out here today
and getting a glimpse of Michael.

352
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:52,501
After watching the progress that Michael
has made in the past two months,

353
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,586
I'd like to announce
that the Chicago White Sox

354
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,129
are extending an invitation

355
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,966
to Major League camp in Sarasota.

356
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:02,970
<i>Hope you got a pen.</i>

357
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,931
Along with the Bulls,
I owned the Chicago White Sox,

358
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,059
and when Michael was signed
to play baseball,

359
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:11,186
I continued paying
his basketball contract,

360
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,605
which was something
over $3 million a year.

361
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:18,110
There was no reason to pay him other than
he was underpaid his entire career,

362
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:20,529
and he made a lot of money
for a lot of people.

363
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:24,491
Picture this now. Bottom of the ninth,
bases loaded, 3-2.

364
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,994
Michael Jordan takes one out of the yard.

365
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:29,162
<i>Michael Jordan
got what he wanted.</i>

366
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,540
<i>He is a rookie again.</i>

367
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:34,751
A lot of people may think this...
off the wall.

368
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:38,588
Maybe it is but, I mean,
I'm doing something that I choose to do.

369
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:42,634
That's try to follow one of the dreams
that I had when I was a kid.

370
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,637
He'd always
loved playing baseball.

371
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:50,058
We thought we was going to be Major League
Baseball players, growing up as a kid.

372
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:56,940
He loves baseball, and his father
always wanted him to play baseball.

373
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,944
Do you recall
your last conversation with him?

374
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,780
We were debating, me and him.

375
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:06,199
We were debating
about me playing baseball.

376
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,868
"Dad, I wanna go play baseball.

377
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:10,245
I'm thinking about retiring.
I wanna play baseball."

378
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:13,248
And all the things that he was saying,
"Do it. Do it."

379
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,334
Because he got me started in baseball.

380
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:18,879
It was always his father's dream
that he'd be a baseball player.

381
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:21,256
I didn't try to talk him out of it,
but I did say,

382
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,551
"Playing baseball
is a lot harder than you think it is."

383
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:31,224
I said, "What position you gonna
be playing?" He says, "In the outfield."

384
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:34,186
So, I said, "Michael, let's understand
something here."

385
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:37,356
I said, "The workouts are going to be
totally different.

386
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:42,944
Two totally different methods
of training your body and muscles.

387
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:46,406
This is going to be detrimental
to your basketball game."

388
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:49,201
He's like, "I don't care.
Baseball. I'm all in."

389
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:53,622
He played baseball
until he was 17 years old.

390
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:57,042
Then doesn't play baseball again
till he's 31 years old.

391
00:22:57,125 --> 00:23:01,713
We don't send anybody to Double-A after
they come out of college or high school

392
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,673
because it's too high a level.

393
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:06,802
We start them out
either at rookie ball or at A-ball.

394
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,845
But we couldn't do that with Michael

395
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:12,766
because the press facilities
were inadequate below Double-A.

396
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:17,145
So we put him at Double-A strictly because
we needed to be able to handle the media.

397
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:20,107
<i>Michael Jordan went to
the Birmingham Barons,</i>

398
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:23,026
<i>the Double-A farm team
of the Chicago White Sox.</i>

399
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,695
When we found out he was coming
to the Birmingham work group,

400
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,781
there was four days left
in spring training,

401
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:32,911
and I just said, "Hey, man, I'm Terry,
and I guess I'm gonna be your manager."

402
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:41,128
I remember him being
in Birmingham, Alabama.

403
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:44,631
You never would have thought
you were at a minor league game.

404
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:49,177
You can't believe... commotion,
the excitement.

405
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:52,097
<i>Never has one rookie
gotten so much attention.</i>

406
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,808
<i>Folks are lying on the ground
for a glimpse of MJ.</i>

407
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:56,908
<i>Reporters and photographers</i>

408
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,812
<i>continue to arrive
from all over the world.</i>

409
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:07,320
Every ballpark we'd go to sold out.

410
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,448
Everybody wants a piece of him.

411
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:12,451
<i>♪ If you can't take the heat
Get yo' ass out the kitchen ♪</i>

412
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:14,202
<i>♪ We on a mission ♪</i>

413
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:19,624
<i>♪ Come along and ride
On a fantastic voyage ♪</i>

414
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,585
<i>♪ Slide slide who-ride ♪</i>

415
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:22,668
Nice hit, Mike.

416
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:27,007
It was kind of fashionable
to roll your eyes at him playing baseball.

417
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:32,846
After I met him, I realized quickly
how much he respected what we were doing.

418
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:34,973
<i>One-one pitch to Michael.</i>

419
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:37,517
<i>Looping drive. It'll score at least one.</i>

420
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:40,687
The thing that people
forget about that season

421
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:43,773
was he started out
with a 13-game hitting streak.

422
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,403
<i>Jordan, base-hit left field.</i>

423
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:54,701
<i>Jordan delivers a two RBI single
to right-center field.</i>

424
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:57,120
Every night
during that 13-game hitting streak,

425
00:24:57,204 --> 00:25:00,165
I'm going, "When's it going to happen?"
And finally it did.

426
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:02,292
He did not see a fastball
in the strike zone

427
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:03,752
for probably a month and a half.

428
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:05,795
They're trying to get him out
with breaking balls.

429
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:08,423
It's breaking ball after breaking ball.

430
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:11,551
And he's swinging at every one of them.

431
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:14,638
<i>Second strikeout in a row
for Michael Jordan.</i>

432
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:17,698
<i>Seen a lot
of breaking balls the last two nights.</i>

433
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:20,701
<i>That hitting streak
in April was kind of a fluke.</i>

434
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:24,606
At that point, the national media
was just giving him some shit.

435
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:29,486
<i>I think his chances of being
any good are almost nil.</i>

436
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:32,239
<i>Playing and...
can't make the play.</i>

437
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:34,383
Just because
you're considered the best

438
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:36,243
to have ever played basketball

439
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:39,454
does not mean you'll find
similar success on the diamond.

440
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:42,624
And now they put him on the cover
of <i>Sports Illustrated.</i>

441
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,709
He's missing a pitch by about that much

442
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:49,297
and it says, "Bag It, Michael.
Jordan embarrasses baseball."

443
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,008
I remember seeing it
and thinking "Oh, no."

444
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:55,720
He calls it his dream that he wants
to be a Major League Baseball player.

445
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:56,930
I call it a delusion.

446
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:59,766
He never spoke to anybody
from <i>Sports Illustrated</i> again.

447
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:02,435
Did you feel betrayed
by that <i>SI</i> cover?

448
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:03,519
Definitely.

449
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:06,147
I never was interviewed for that.

450
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,733
They came out to critique me

451
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:11,528
without understanding
what my passion was at the time.

452
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:14,030
If you had a question to ask...

453
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:17,158
and then if you want to write it,
then you write it.

454
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,578
That's fine. No problem.
That's your opinion.

455
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:22,956
But I can care less what people do.
This is what I want to do.

456
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,459
It's not what... I'm not doing
what they think I should be doing.

457
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:29,963
My father already told me
I was doing the right thing and I did it.

458
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:35,719
Being away from basketball
gave him an opportunity

459
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:38,763
to adjust his life
to not having his dad...

460
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:41,600
and moving on.

461
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,728
So when you want to
get in the cage?

462
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:46,187
- 7:30?
- I'm there.

463
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:50,275
That fueled me more than anything
and it drove me to make this thing work.

464
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:52,777
"I gotta play catch-up
but I'm gonna do it."

465
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:57,115
I had fucking blisters, the second skin,
swinging that bat.

466
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:02,287
His work ethic
was the best I've ever been around.

467
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:06,124
He would hit early in the day.
He'd hit off the breaking ball machine.

468
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:09,419
He would come in
after regular batting practice,

469
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:13,298
hit some more before the game,
and then would hit again after the game.

470
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,426
By the time we got to August...

471
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:20,555
you can see it just building,

472
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:23,433
and he kept getting better and better
and better.

473
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:24,851
<i>...in the seventh.</i>

474
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:30,315
<i>It's a fly ball, that's deep,
that's back and... gone!</i>

475
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:33,360
<i>Home run, Michael Jordan. Barons lead.</i>

476
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:36,863
And he hit over .200.
That was amazing that he did that well.

477
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:41,201
I can't believe he actually hit .202
and he drove in 50 runs.

478
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:44,496
We had a lot of good prospects
that didn't drive in 50 runs.

479
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,666
In my opinion, with 1,500 at-bats,

480
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:50,001
he'd have found a way
to get to the Major League.

481
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,961
<i>Swing and a fly ball!</i>

482
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:58,927
I think the time away in baseball
freed his mind of, you know,

483
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,345
what had happened to his father.

484
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:04,349
When you're on the road
with a baseball team,

485
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:05,850
that's who you're with.

486
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,394
Your family doesn't travel with you

487
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:09,479
so you hang out
with the guys that you're with,

488
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:11,189
and that was all of his teammates.

489
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:12,899
I think he enjoyed it immensely.

490
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:16,861
Sure, I mean,
I was this big icon...

491
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:20,198
but they treated me
as I wanted to be treated.

492
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:21,366
Just one of the guys.

493
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,535
It was good for him.

494
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:24,994
He was like a kid again.

495
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:37,966
The pre-playoff buzz around the league

496
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,218
was that the Chicago Bulls
were vulnerable.

497
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:42,846
Now we've heard
those same declarations in the past

498
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:44,389
from the so-called pundits

499
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:46,975
but maybe this year,
they finally have some merit,

500
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:51,354
especially after the injury-riddled
and eighth-seeded New Jersey Nets

501
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:54,941
took the five-time NBA world champions
into overtime.

502
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:57,235
Every time we would play good

503
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:58,945
and we were winning games,

504
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:00,321
everything was okay.

505
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:07,203
But everybody was always on alert
around Michael after a bad game like that.

506
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:15,462
He would say, "You motherfuckers
didn't do a thing today.

507
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,714
Come ready tomorrow to practice."

508
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:22,510
His theory was, "If you can't handle
pressure from me,

509
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:28,141
uh, you're not gonna be able
to handle pressure of the NBA playoffs."

510
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:31,186
And so he talked trash in practice.

511
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,520
He went at guys.

512
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,814
He challenged guys.

513
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:41,905
Hee! Hee! Hee!

514
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:45,909
Hoo! Hee! Whoo!

515
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:50,622
Whoo! Yeah, I remember, yeah.

516
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:54,042
He wants to win
and you gotta earn everything in Chicago.

517
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,211
There was nothing easy.
Nothing given to you.

518
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:58,838
You better go out there and earn it.
You earn it in practice.

519
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:00,548
Scott Burrell.

520
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:02,592
What up, Scott?

521
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:04,719
You ready today?

522
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,971
We gonna bust y'all ass today.

523
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,974
Yeah, I know. We wounded. We're wounded.

524
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,519
When there's a sick dog down,
keep 'em down.

525
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:14,687
Yeah, but you better watch out
for the lead dog,

526
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:17,607
he'll bite the shit out of you.

527
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:21,736
I mean, they just rode Scotty

528
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,781
and Scotty just smiled at Michael

529
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:27,242
and took it and fired right back at him.

530
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:30,787
Scott, I advise you to guard
somebody else, like Jud.

531
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,872
You can't even guard Jud.

532
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,541
I don't wanna... I wanna guard you.

533
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:36,167
You don't wanna... Hey.

534
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,460
If you can guard me,

535
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:40,171
there's 290-something jobs
looking for you.

536
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,675
I got Scott.

537
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:46,344
<i>Scotty Burrell
was a talented guy.</i>

538
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:50,306
<i>And Scott Burrell,
an exceptional basketball player</i>

539
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,767
<i>out of the University of Connecticut...</i>

540
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:58,773
What Scotty was lacking was commitment,
determination, seriousness.

541
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:02,026
So he became, you know,
my guy to kinda push,

542
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,194
keep pushing.

543
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:08,408
I tried to get him to fight me
a couple of times, in a good sense.

544
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:11,536
Just to get him, "All right.
I'm tired of you picking on me."

545
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:13,288
You know, that type of mentality.

546
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:15,874
I could never get...

547
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:17,959
He's such a nice guy.

548
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:23,715
<i>But I know we were gonna need him
at some point in time.</i>

549
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:25,216
<i>And he's gonna remember this</i>

550
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,468
<i>and he's gonna get out there
and he's gonna fight.</i>

551
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,513
Garbage. Don't bring that bullshit.

552
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:32,932
You're playing with the guy

553
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:35,810
that has the highest standards
of any basketball player ever.

554
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:38,104
You wanna live up to that challenge.

555
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:39,981
It's tough. Tough love.

556
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:42,108
You gotta go out there and do your job.

557
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:45,028
Go sit your asses down! Game time!

558
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:46,821
That's nine, bitch!

559
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,866
Hey, Scott,
where your mouth at now, homie?

560
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,287
He'd get feisty in a practice
and maybe get up against people.

561
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,749
I'd have to talk a little bit
about toning it down

562
00:31:57,832 --> 00:32:01,377
and make amends, and, you know,
keep that level of team camaraderie.

563
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:05,006
That's your role too,
as a part of this and being a captain.

564
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:13,640
My mentality was to go out
and win at any cost.

565
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:18,019
If you don't want to live
that regimented mentality,

566
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:20,063
then you don't need to be alongside of me

567
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:23,191
because I'mma ridicule you
until you get on the same level with me.

568
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:26,069
If you don't get on the same level,
then it's gonna be hell for you.

569
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:29,364
Why you keep fucking up that play,
you big, fat-head motherfucker?

570
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:31,366
Shoot a layup, you dumbass!

571
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:38,706
People were afraid of him.

572
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,709
We were his teammates and we were afraid.
There was just fear.

573
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:44,003
Catch the ball when I throw it to you.

574
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:45,838
I just threw it to you.

575
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:48,722
...ignore this guy,
he's come through, but he's overplayed...

576
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:52,804
The fear factor of MJ
was so, so thick.

577
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:56,683
Yeah, let's not get it wrong.
He was an asshole. He was a jerk.

578
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,936
He crossed the line numerous times.

579
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:02,146
But as time goes on and you think back

580
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:05,149
about what he was actually
trying to accomplish,

581
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,735
you're like,
"Yeah, he was a hell of a teammate."

582
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,904
He was pushing us all to be better.

583
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:12,699
Because he wanted to win.

584
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:13,782
And guess what?

585
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:15,660
It worked.

586
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:17,996
We needed that, you know what I'm saying?

587
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:21,290
I needed him to be the bad guy,
the tough guy.

588
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:24,043
You couldn't make
a damn jump shot all night long.

589
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:26,337
How many did you make?
You made one, didn't you?

590
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:27,922
One for seven.

591
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:31,968
I feel bad for you, dog, your cat's sick.
Go home and feed it Purina Cat Chow.

592
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:33,511
It was a struggle.

593
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:36,097
You know, Scott got a great personality.

594
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:40,685
He took it like a man and he embraced it.

595
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:42,979
Come on, Scott Burrell.

596
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:45,732
You wanna be on this damn team,
you better do something right.

597
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:46,983
Make this free throw.

598
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,066
Dance, boy.

599
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,236
There you go.

600
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,948
Each and every day,
he's going to push you

601
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,324
to try to get you where he is,

602
00:33:55,408 --> 00:34:00,913
but I'm not sure if he knows
that only he can achieve those goals.

603
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:03,416
But he can push other guys
to try to get there, though.

604
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:13,384
<i>The Bulls held their first
workout minus Michael Jordan today,</i>

605
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:16,137
<i>the central peg gone from a nine-year era</i>

606
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:19,098
<i>that left the Bulls with several
key challenges and question marks</i>

607
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,641
<i>about the upcoming season.</i>

608
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:24,854
It's a great opportunity for ball players
that have wanted larger roles

609
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:26,856
on this team to step up
and fill some shoes.

610
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:30,985
Scottie has now stepped out
of the shadow of a great figure

611
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,362
and he's now got the light
all shining on him.

612
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:38,034
We just gotta put the story behind
with having Michael and go on.

613
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:42,121
I mean, our lives goes on,
the game goes on, basketball goes on.

614
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:43,956
<i>Pippen on the move.</i>

615
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,502
<i>Pippen accelerates, down the lane.
That is vintage Scottie Pippen.</i>

616
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:49,646
<i>Rider takes it,
and blocked away by Scottie.</i>

617
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:54,300
<i>Horace Grant running down
the left side. Pippen on the right.</i>

618
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:56,719
<i>Gives it back to Steve Kerr.
Lets fly for a...</i>

619
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:59,972
<i>Time winding down.
Batted... Scottie Pippen!</i>

620
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:01,656
<i>And the reverse jam!</i>

621
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:03,684
<i>Oh, man!</i>

622
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:09,774
Scottie was our prime motivator,
initiator, organized the offense.

623
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:11,901
He really stepped into that role.

624
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:15,165
How did the team do
that first season without Michael?

625
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:16,905
Great.

626
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:19,408
They had nobody yelling at 'em.

627
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:22,703
They got up plenty of shots.

628
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:27,041
Michael would just
bludgeon everybody around him,

629
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:30,336
and Scottie was the much softer touch.

630
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:33,840
He was the guy who would comfort you
when things weren't going well

631
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:36,843
and put his arm around you and,
"Hang in there. You'll be all right."

632
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:42,890
Everyone expected me to try to be the man,

633
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:48,146
but we beat teams by committee
and we just learned to play together

634
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:50,815
and share the ball and win together.

635
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,780
That particular season,
when Michael was gone,

636
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:00,408
that was the season
Phil did his best coaching.

637
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,118
I heard Chuck Daly say,

638
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:04,829
"Let's see the triangle offense work now
without Michael."

639
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:06,592
- Did he really say that?
- Yes.

640
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:07,999
Wait till I see Chuck.

641
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,629
Everybody criticizes the triangle

642
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:16,883
and says, "When you have Michael,
then it works."

643
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:21,512
But that one year,
his star player was Pippen,

644
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,140
who is not a scorer.

645
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:25,933
He's a facilitator...

646
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:31,856
and they ran the triangle to perfection.

647
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:36,194
<i>Toni Kukoc makes the move on
the baseline. Back to Wennington. Paxson.</i>

648
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:37,528
<i>Over to Scottie, baseline.</i>

649
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:40,114
<i>Steve Kerr drives in,
delivers to Wennington.</i>

650
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:45,036
<i>Another surprise for the Bulls</i>

651
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,747
<i>has been the emergence
of rookie Toni Kukoc.</i>

652
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:50,208
<i>The international superstar from Croatia</i>

653
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,418
<i>came to the Bulls
after a long courtship</i>

654
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:54,545
<i>by Bulls general manager Jerry Krause.</i>

655
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:56,881
For those...

656
00:36:56,964 --> 00:37:01,135
For those of you
who are, uh, new to number seven,

657
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:07,516
number seven in Europe is
the most popular number on the continent.

658
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,019
A lot of youngsters wanna be like Toni.

659
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:16,901
He was a typical European player
at that time,

660
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:19,320
who was an incredible shooter,

661
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:21,239
but defense was not his thing.

662
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:23,115
<i>One-on-three and put it in.</i>

663
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,909
Phil was tough on him.

664
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:29,747
Well, I understood that part,

665
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:32,750
that coming here,
nothing's going to be given to me

666
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:36,337
just because I was really good in Europe.

667
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:40,341
Obviously, you needed time
to prove some things to each other.

668
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:44,512
That season, we were winning a lot.

669
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:48,557
<i>And the Chicago Bulls
will advance to round number two...</i>

670
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:52,770
I felt, "Okay. There is a chance

671
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:56,607
we might actually get to the NBA finals
without Michael."

672
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:03,155
<i>We ended up playing the Knicks
in the east semis.</i>

673
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:06,867
<i>We're down 2-0 and we were trying
to get back in the series.</i>

674
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:11,539
<i>Patrick Ewing made a shot with about
two seconds left to tie the game</i>

675
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:15,751
<i>and we were at risk
of losing the whole series right there.</i>

676
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:19,422
<i>Chicago have taken
their last timeout</i>

677
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:23,718
<i>to set up a shot with 1.8 seconds
on the clock.</i>

678
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:28,889
So we come to the bench
and I have this sequence

679
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:32,560
that Toni has run before
and he scored before on it.

680
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,645
I know he can do this.

681
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:38,858
I did hit a lot of last-second shots
during the season.

682
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:42,320
<i>Gives it back.
Toni, long three.</i>

683
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:46,449
<i>Here's Kukoc,
he hits on the left...</i>

684
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:50,453
<i>Toni got it.
Put it up. Look out!</i>

685
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:51,536
<i>He got it!</i>

686
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:54,582
So anyway, I set this up
and then Scottie was angry about it.

687
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:58,711
I felt like it was an insult,
coming from Phil.

688
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:02,089
I was the most dangerous guy on our team

689
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:04,759
so why are you asking me
to take the ball out?

690
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:08,721
This is a season
where he's taken the role of Michael.

691
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:10,723
He's had this MVP-caliber season.

692
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:14,018
He thought
it should be him taking the shot.

693
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:19,190
And so Jim Cleamons came over
and said Scottie's not going in.

694
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:21,567
Phil said, "What do you mean
he's not going in?"

695
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:24,236
I go down and said,
"Are you in or out?" He said...

696
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:26,696
"I'm out."

697
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:30,201
I remember Phil said,
"Fuck him. Pete Myers, come on in."

698
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:34,080
When Pip refused
to go in that game,

699
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,166
it was like a <i>Twilight Zone</i> moment.

700
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:39,418
Like, "What the hell is going on?"

701
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:41,295
<i>Scottie's gonna sit here.</i>

702
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:44,924
<i>That's strange, isn't it?
That he would sit on this.</i>

703
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:49,470
<i>1.8 left,
no timeouts left for the Bulls.</i>

704
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,430
<i>Myers,
triggers the in-bounds pass.</i>

705
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,811
<i>Kukoc, for the win...</i>

706
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:04,318
<i>Bulls win! Bulls win!</i>

707
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:07,988
<i>Kukoc with the life-saver. Oh, man!</i>

708
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:13,536
<i>What a basket by Toni Kukoc at the buzzer.</i>

709
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:17,164
I would say I was obviously happy
for making a shot,

710
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:20,126
but the whole situation,
even going towards the locker,

711
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:25,673
you see everybody is pissed
that things are not right.

712
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:29,009
We don't know how to act 'cause
Scottie's one of our favorite teammates,

713
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,469
one of our favorite people.

714
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:35,433
He quit on us
and we couldn't believe that happened.

715
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:38,436
It was... it was devastating.

716
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:43,149
What he did, you know,
you just don't expect a teammate to do.

717
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:46,193
So I go out,
and just address it to the team.

718
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,863
This is something that we never thought
would ever happen,

719
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:50,406
that we would stop playing.

720
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:54,827
"It's affected us as a whole team,
Scottie, that you did this."

721
00:40:55,411 --> 00:41:00,124
What I remember most, though,
is Bill Cartwright after the game.

722
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:06,464
Bill Cartwright gets up
and makes this speech...

723
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:13,512
saying, "Pip, you let us down.
I can't believe..." and he started crying.

724
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:17,766
Tears were coming down his face
and he said,

725
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:21,395
"Scottie, I cannot believe
that you quit on us like that."

726
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:26,692
We had come too far with that team
to go out like that.

727
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:31,489
Scottie was in tears and upset
and he realized, "I made a mistake.

728
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:33,657
I thought I was bigger than the game.
I'm not."

729
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:34,950
And he apologized to us.

730
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:39,705
I think the worst part was that we knew
it was not Scottie's character.

731
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:41,165
We knew that wasn't him,

732
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:45,961
uh, and we knew it was gonna be a stain
on his reputation.

733
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,007
The next day,
I get a call from Michael.

734
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:54,678
He said, "I don't know
if Scottie's ever gonna live this down."

735
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,639
It's always going to come back
to haunt him

736
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:58,724
at some point in some conversation.

737
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:02,353
Pip knows better than that.

738
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:07,316
It's one of those incidents
where I wish it never happened,

739
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:11,570
but if I had a chance to do it over again,
I probably wouldn't change it.

740
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:15,157
The next couple of days
were really important.

741
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:19,703
We had to refocus and get back at it
for the rest of the series.

742
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,046
<i>Great passing!</i>

743
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,803
Scottie had a great series
and he turned things around.

744
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:38,264
<i>Scottie Pippen
just went over</i>

745
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:42,017
<i>to tell Spike Lee a few things, close up.</i>

746
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:48,732
We all respected his apology
and we moved forward.

747
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:52,444
We came very close
to making a deep playoff run.

748
00:42:57,533 --> 00:43:00,286
But we lost in seven games to the Knicks
in the Garden.

749
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:02,454
<i>It has been a wonderful run</i>

750
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:04,707
<i>for the Chicago Bulls franchise
this season,</i>

751
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:07,167
<i>despite the loss of Michael Jordan.</i>

752
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:10,546
<i>He wanted solitude
from the cameras</i>

753
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:13,007
<i>to watch his former mates' final moments.</i>

754
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:15,217
It's no different from a fan, you know?

755
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:16,969
<i>It's Jordan, the fan,</i>

756
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:19,847
<i>who watches a replay
of the Bulls' futile attempt.</i>

757
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:25,603
I'd rather just...
do it privately so it's no,

758
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:28,355
"Well, he's itching to get back
into the game"

759
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,316
or, you know, none of that stuff.

760
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:33,235
I'm happy to be where I am.
But I'm still a fan.

761
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:35,696
I like being around and watching the game.

762
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:52,439
Let's go out and play hard.

763
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,223
Let's prove we can play
better than game one.

764
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:55,256
Come on, fellas.

765
00:43:56,508 --> 00:43:57,760
<i>Here we are,</i>

766
00:43:57,843 --> 00:44:00,262
<i>game two of the New Jersey Nets
and the Chicago Bulls.</i>

767
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:02,681
<i>Crawford's gonna toss it up
and we're going to be underway.</i>

768
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:15,444
<i>Pippen back.
Finds Kerr all alone.</i>

769
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:17,696
<i>And that's what usually happens.</i>

770
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:20,658
<i>And a reverse slam
by Bill Wennington.</i>

771
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:23,202
<i>Where did that come from?</i>

772
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:25,996
<i>This is a shot in the arm
for the Bulls.</i>

773
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,082
<i>Their bench much livelier today,</i>

774
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:30,626
<i>much more aggressive,
looking for their shots.</i>

775
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:35,255
<i>Chicago is gonna take
the two games at home,</i>

776
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:39,635
<i>but it turns out to have been
much more difficult than they anticipated.</i>

777
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:42,278
<i>Coming up,
game three of our best-of-five series.</i>

778
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:45,933
<i>The Bulls can pull off
the sweep tonight with a victory.</i>

779
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:55,484
<i>Filling the lane
is Burrell with the easy layup.</i>

780
00:44:57,361 --> 00:45:01,532
<i>Burrell for another three and he's got it.
Scott Burrell...</i>

781
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:03,534
<i>What a game he's having.</i>

782
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:06,578
<i>Burrell,
9-of-11 shooting, 23 points.</i>

783
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:08,872
<i>Finishing touches, Jordan on point.</i>

784
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:16,338
<i>Time runs out. And the
Chicago Bulls sweep a first-round series.</i>

785
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:19,633
<i>So, Scott Burrell with 23 points tonight.</i>

786
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:25,514
<i>Final score, 116-101.
The Bulls, led by that man, with 38.</i>

787
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:27,224
<i>One down and three to go</i>

788
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:30,686
<i>if the Chicago Bulls are to claim
NBA title number six.</i>

789
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:34,231
<i>The New Jersey Nets having been
disposed of in three straight.</i>

790
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:36,483
<i>Next up are the Charlotte Hornets.</i>

791
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:42,322
We all know Michael's tenacious
on the court.

792
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:44,032
It was business on the court,

793
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:46,410
but he was a good guy
to be around off the court.

794
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:49,496
You can relax around him off the court.
He's fun, he's enjoyable.

795
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:54,042
- You like that yes or no question? Yes.
- I had a follow-up for that too.

796
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:56,086
Yeah, I know.
That's why I answered it yes.

797
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:57,880
What's up, partner?

798
00:45:58,505 --> 00:45:59,506
How you doing, Mike?

799
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,383
- Steve?
- Nice to meet ya.

800
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:02,843
Know this guy? What's your name?

801
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:04,261
- I'm Jerry.
- Nice to meet you.

802
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:06,054
- Can I get an autograph?
- Sure.

803
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:08,640
- I got some of your shoes. Appreciate it.
- You do?

804
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:09,724
Hell, yeah.

805
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:11,894
Could you sign this real quick for me?

806
00:46:11,977 --> 00:46:14,396
I'm a collector, man.
You owe me a thousand bucks.

807
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:17,316
He gonna pay it too.

808
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,109
How long are you in town?

809
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:21,361
I dunno, we might leave tonight.

810
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:23,280
- We drove up from Connecticut.
- Yeah?

811
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:25,574
Yeah, we got about a 14-hour drive.

812
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:27,576
UConn's got a great women's team.

813
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:32,998
You had to say that, didn't you?
So does Carolina, though.

814
00:46:33,081 --> 00:46:34,708
No, I mean, that's not a knock.

815
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:36,752
So does Carolina.

816
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:42,341
Off the floor, he was gonna
be cordial and accepting,

817
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:46,220
he was gonna be nice, but as a teammate,
he had certain expectations.

818
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:48,430
Was he a nice guy?

819
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:52,559
He couldn't have been nice.

820
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:59,566
With that kind of mentality he had,
he can't be a nice guy.

821
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:02,653
He would be difficult to be around

822
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:05,447
if you didn't truly love
the game of basketball.

823
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:06,907
He is difficult.

824
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:09,952
Through the years,
do you think that intensity

825
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:13,580
has come at the expense of being perceived
as a nice guy?

826
00:47:15,457 --> 00:47:16,458
Well, I mean...

827
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:19,837
I don't know, I mean...

828
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:23,715
Winning has a price.

829
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:27,135
And leadership has a price.

830
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:32,349
So, I pulled people along
when they didn't wanna be pulled.

831
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:36,311
I challenged people
when they didn't wanna be challenged.

832
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:40,858
And I earned that right
because my teammates who came after me

833
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:43,819
didn't endure all the things
that I endured.

834
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:46,029
<i>Michael Jordan
is down in pain.</i>

835
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:48,156
<i>Michael Jordan got taken out. He's hurt.</i>

836
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:52,828
<i>And Jordan
came down hard and is injured.</i>

837
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:55,122
<i>The Pistons have moved on</i>

838
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:58,333
<i>but you really gotta feel
for this man right here.</i>

839
00:47:58,417 --> 00:47:59,918
<i>I mean, playing his heart out.</i>

840
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:01,907
Once you join the team,

841
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:03,964
you live at a certain standard
that I play the game

842
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:06,466
and I wasn't gonna take anything less.

843
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:10,888
Now, if that means I had to go in
and get in your ass a little bit?

844
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:12,097
Then I did that.

845
00:48:16,768 --> 00:48:20,314
You ask all my teammates?
"The one thing about Michael Jordan was

846
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:23,650
he never asked me to do something
that he didn't fucking do."

847
00:48:33,827 --> 00:48:37,164
When people see this, they gonna say,
"He wasn't really a nice guy.

848
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:39,082
He may have been a tyrant."

849
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:41,585
Well, that's you,
because you never won anything.

850
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:46,340
I wanted to win, but I wanted them to win
and be a part of that as well.

851
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:14,785
Look, I don't have to do this.
I'm only doing it because it is who I am.

852
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,287
That's how I played the game.

853
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:19,414
That was my mentality.

854
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:24,795
If you don't wanna play that way...

855
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:27,255
don't play that way.

856
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:31,634
Break.
