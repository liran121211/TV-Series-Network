1
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:10,677
<i>Pacers lead by six, 20-14.</i>

2
00:00:11,594 --> 00:00:14,723
<i>Pippen gets the screen,
trying to go by Smits.</i>

3
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:16,599
<i>Moves on the baseline, lost it.</i>

4
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:21,396
<i>And Richardson has it. He is one on three,
takes it to the basket.</i>

5
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:23,106
<i>And... it's tipped in.</i>

6
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:27,652
<i>Oh, and Reggie Miller came over
and smacked Mike and MJ is upset.</i>

7
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:29,112
<i>I can't blame him.</i>

8
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:32,991
<i>Yes, sir, he ran
right into him. We got a brouhaha here.</i>

9
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,581
Don't hold him back. Let him go.

10
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:47,464
He and I had somewhat
of a unique relationship.

11
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:52,719
Most people feared Michael Jordan,
and rightfully so.

12
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:57,223
But I didn't fear him
like the rest of the league did,

13
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:01,269
and we had to lock horns quite a bit.

14
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:05,315
<i>Pacers lead by ten.
Jordan, the steal!</i>

15
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:08,526
<i>- In on... Jackson...
- Oh!</i>

16
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,154
<i>Throws the ball at Jackson
in frustration.</i>

17
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,466
<i>He thought
Jackson tried to take him out,</i>

18
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,784
<i>so Michael's gonna get a technical
on that play.</i>

19
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,787
<i>And then
Reggie Miller came over.</i>

20
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:20,413
I respected him so much,

21
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:23,958
but he probably just thought
I was some mouthy, skinny kid...

22
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:28,046
and he was one of the best
trash talkers in our game.

23
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:32,801
My rookie year,
we're playing against Chicago.

24
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,846
And as a rookie, you're gonna go 110%

25
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,641
because you're trying
to impress your vets on your team.

26
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,186
<i>Miller around a Stipanovich screen,</i>

27
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:44,604
<i>turns a corner, down the lane,
lays it in, foul called.</i>

28
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:47,190
<i>Reggie Miller scores,
and he was fouled by Jordan.</i>

29
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,401
I remember
I had, like, ten points at half,

30
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,862
and MJ didn't shoot the ball
particularly great.

31
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,490
So, I was like,
"Yeah, you're Michael Jordan,

32
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:56,950
the guy that walks on water?"

33
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,409
He looks at me.

34
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,806
<i>Jordan at the foul line,
comes up shooting, good.</i>

35
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,624
Second half,
I ended up with only two points.

36
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:08,461
So I had 12 for the game, and he ended up
with a lot more.

37
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,131
<i>Jordan's got 37.</i>

38
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,717
And I remember him
walking off the court.

39
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:16,426
He was like...

40
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,514
"Don't ever talk trash to Black Jesus."

41
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:23,935
And that's when I stopped referring to him
as Michael Jordan,

42
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:26,604
and I always refer to him
either as "Jordan,"

43
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,858
"Black Jesus" or "that Black Cat."

44
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:33,194
I never called him
Michael Jordan again after that.

45
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:37,574
<i>A spectacular move!</i>

46
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,242
<i>The game's over!</i>

47
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,661
<i>Chicago Stadium is going wild!</i>

48
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:45,808
<i>First of all,
there's no backstabbing going on here.</i>

49
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,143
<i>It's time for me to move on.</i>

50
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,727
<i>This will be Phil's last year
as the coach of the Bulls.</i>

51
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:55,216
- <i>Are the expectations too high?
- Where do we go from here?</i>

52
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,260
<i>The only question: how long can it last?</i>

53
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:12,692
<i>Good afternoon.
Welcome to the Eastern Conference Finals,</i>

54
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,986
<i>the Bulls and the Indiana Pacers.</i>

55
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:18,031
<i>First time these two clubs
have faced each other in the playoffs.</i>

56
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:20,867
<i>The tip to Indiana.</i>

57
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:27,457
In '98,
that was my first year coaching

58
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,794
and it was our best opportunity
to win a championship.

59
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:35,131
We were confident
that we can dethrone the Bulls.

60
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,634
We felt like we were just as versatile.

61
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,637
We had Rik Smits, the Dunking Dutchman.

62
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,724
Mark Jackson, one of the greatest
assist guys the league has seen.

63
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:46,309
We had the Davis brothers.

64
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:52,899
Chris Mullin, one of the sweet
shooting players of all time.

65
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:56,027
And Reggie Miller, a Hall of Famer.

66
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,029
We had a squad.

67
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:03,868
That series with Indiana
was the hardest playoff series we had.

68
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,746
They were big, strong, physical.

69
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:11,125
If I had to pick a team that gave us
the toughest time in the east,

70
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:14,963
Indiana was probably the toughest,
outside of Detroit.

71
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,257
They were tough.

72
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,593
Every time I'd go in that fucking game
and come out, I got a new scratch.

73
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,887
It became personal with me.

74
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:27,183
<i>Michael through the hole,
reverse, plus the foul!</i>

75
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:31,562
<i>Here's Michael with the steal,
and Chicago with the lead.</i>

76
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,942
<i>Game one to Chicago.</i>

77
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:40,738
<i>Welcome back
to the United Center.</i>

78
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:45,827
<i>Game two of the
NBA Eastern Conference Finals.</i>

79
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:50,123
It's my privilege
to present Michael Jordan

80
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:53,543
with his fifth
NBA Most Valuable Player trophy.

81
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,797
May I say on behalf of everyone
this evening, thank you.

82
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:10,184
<i>Here is Longley going
strong to the basket. Luc Longley.</i>

83
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,396
<i>Here's Kerr for three again,
and if this hits...</i>

84
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:18,151
<i>Somehow, someway, every year,
Steve Kerr gets a big basket</i>

85
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:19,694
<i>to put a dagger in someone's heart.</i>

86
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:23,573
<i>Under two minutes remaining
here in the fourth quarter. Jordan...</i>

87
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,868
<i>Michael Jordan with a fallaway...</i>

88
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:29,954
<i>Oh! What a shot by Michael Jordan!</i>

89
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,666
<i>And that may be the exclamation point
for the Chicago Bulls.</i>

90
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,794
<i>The Bulls are winners, 104-98.</i>

91
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:39,922
<i>Bulls lead the series 2-0.
Jordan, 41 points.</i>

92
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:44,594
It's back to the drawing board.
This is...

93
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,013
You play for this time of year,

94
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:50,099
and we've come too far
to let something like this slip away.

95
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,771
- My brother. You all right?
- I'm doing good.

96
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,147
How's your family? Good?

97
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,110
- It's gonna be a battle. I know.
- You know it.

98
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:00,526
- I knew that coming in.
- Okay.

99
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,538
Pacers are gonna kick Chicago's rear end.

100
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,211
The Bulls are going down! Going down!

101
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:22,715
Step up and pound...
the Bull-Crap Mobile.

102
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,390
We won the first two games
in Chicago.

103
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:34,143
But the next game that we had,
it was on the road.

104
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:39,482
And their arena was really,
like, a tough place to win.

105
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:48,408
Let's give 'em something to boo about.
Let's go, boys.

106
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:53,246
Game three,
Reggie was a problem.

107
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,665
Because Reggie had...

108
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,209
insane confidence.

109
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:00,378
<i>Reggie...</i>

110
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:01,671
When he was on...

111
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:06,008
he could make it from anywhere
over anybody at any time.

112
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:09,095
<i>Miller, catch, shoot, score.</i>

113
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:11,431
<i>Reggie Miller!</i>

114
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:13,683
<i>Miller...</i>

115
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,435
<i>hits the three out of the corner!</i>

116
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,174
<i>Miller for three...</i>

117
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:26,654
<i>That may have finished the Bulls.</i>

118
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:28,990
<i>Twenty-six for Reggie.</i>

119
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,910
<i>And Indiana wins game three.</i>

120
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:40,877
Now we give ourselves a shot on Monday
to try and tie this thing up.

121
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,880
So, you know Chicago
is never gonna go away.

122
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:47,717
As long as that Black Cat's out there,
anything is possible.

123
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,472
We'll be fine.
I think today is just a bump in the road.

124
00:07:57,518 --> 00:08:01,105
<i>The Bulls weren't impressed
by the Pacers' game three victory.</i>

125
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,232
<i>Michael Jordan called it
"a bump in the road."</i>

126
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,319
<i>Phil Jackson said, "Look, they had
to play very well at home to beat us,</i>

127
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,446
<i>and even then, they barely beat us."</i>

128
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:13,034
It was a hard-fought series.
The most memorable game was game four.

129
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,329
<i>The tip to Indiana.</i>

130
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:21,334
<i>Reggie out of the corner. Tough shot, air.</i>

131
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,713
<i>Pippen dishes to Michael.</i>

132
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:31,969
<i>Jordan's shot is shoved back in his face.</i>

133
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,013
<i>Michael appears to be bleeding.</i>

134
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:36,557
<i>It's Miller for three.</i>

135
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,604
<i>Michael starting to heat up
after a slow start.</i>

136
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:47,652
<i>It's a one-point game
with 6.4 on the clock.</i>

137
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:50,947
Control the boards. We gotta have
everybody come in and rebound.

138
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,491
Mike, this kid's got a hot hand right now.

139
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,537
<i>Indiana has a timeout.
They elect not to use it.</i>

140
00:08:58,579 --> 00:08:59,747
<i>McKey looking.</i>

141
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,250
<i>Gets it in for Miller, batted away,</i>

142
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,544
<i>grabbed by Pippen,
and they have to foul him.</i>

143
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:10,216
I was so upset that I felt,

144
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:14,387
"Is this gonna be it?
Are they gonna go up 3-1?"

145
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:17,348
Because you go down 3-1,
it's going back to Chicago.

146
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:20,768
It's a death sentence, really.
We can't go out like this.

147
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:23,938
<i>Scottie Pippen has had a great game,</i>

148
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:26,566
<i>but he's only two of five
from the foul line.</i>

149
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:28,401
<i>A miss!</i>

150
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,032
<i>You don't wanna give up a second shot.</i>

151
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:40,288
<i>Missed them both.
Loose ball, out of bounds, who's got it?</i>

152
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:44,125
<i>Indiana ball with 2.9 seconds.</i>

153
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,254
<i>And Larry Bird uses his last timeout.</i>

154
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,135
When I was coaching,

155
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:56,971
we always had something a little different
at the end of the game,

156
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:59,599
two seconds left,
four seconds left or whatever.

157
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,226
So, if it got close,
we knew what we were running.

158
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:06,230
There are a lot of players to make shots
the first three quarters of the game,

159
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:09,817
but when you talk about who gonna
make a shot late, get the ball to Reggie.

160
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,900
I remember when Larry
was drawing the play.

161
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:18,034
I was thinking, "Put all the pressure
on the official to make a call."

162
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:22,413
<i>Jordan is on Best.
Harper's on Miller.</i>

163
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:24,415
When the play was drawn up,

164
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:27,376
I knew they were gonna switch
and MJ was gonna be on me.

165
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,629
So I just went right to his chest...

166
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:36,510
and lightly, lightly shoved him
a little bit to create that space...

167
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,554
and the rest was history.

168
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,517
<i>McKey...
gets it in to Miller for the win!</i>

169
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,897
<i>Four tenths of a second!</i>

170
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:53,277
<i>One of the greatest clutch
playoff performers of his generation...</i>

171
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,821
<i>has apparently done it again.</i>

172
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,202
<i>Yeah, you can dance, Reggie.</i>

173
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,835
The entire building
was in a frenzy, as we should be,

174
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:13,214
but please put the camera on Larry Bird.

175
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,343
Larry looked up at that clock.

176
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:22,306
It's like... stoic demeanor
because he knew what we all knew,

177
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:25,518
that they had Michael Jordan
and there was still time on the clock.

178
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,196
We knew
where the ball was gonna go.

179
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,524
Everyone in the building knew
where the ball was gonna go.

180
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,569
<i>Kukoc to Michael at the buzzer...</i>

181
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,865
I remember being underneath the basket
as the ball is coming.

182
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,576
And I'm looking, I'm like,
"This is going in."

183
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,162
<i>He lobs to Jordan,
he got it off...</i>

184
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,499
<i>It spun out, and it's two to two!</i>

185
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:52,962
<i>Unbelievable!</i>

186
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:56,924
I mean, millimeters,
millimeters in and out.

187
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:01,846
And we made 'em double clutch
on that shot, and he still almost made it.

188
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:13,441
<i>You said Saturday's loss
was just a bump in the road.</i>

189
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:15,484
<i>What about this game?
Where do you go from here?</i>

190
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:21,532
You still gotta come through Chicago,
Utah, Indiana.

191
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:24,785
They still got to come through Chicago.
I don't care what happens today.

192
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,954
I don't care what happened
in the other series.

193
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:28,873
They still gotta come through Chicago.

194
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:55,107
We had our hands full out west
for my entire career. Um...

195
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:58,569
We played great teams,
and we were so close so many times,

196
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:00,696
and just couldn't get over the top.

197
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:03,908
Then we win
in kind of a last-second fashion.

198
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:06,702
<i>Stockton, open three...</i>

199
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:07,870
<i>Yeah!</i>

200
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:13,292
<i>John Stockton sends the Utah Jazz
to the NBA Finals!</i>

201
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:16,837
We had a chance to play
and test ourselves against the best,

202
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,631
and that means as much to me as anything.

203
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,383
What's the biggest
motivating factor

204
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:22,760
going into that series for you?

205
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:25,971
Karl Malone getting MVP.

206
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,682
Congratulations, Karl Malone,

207
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:34,104
1996-97 NBA Most Valuable Player.

208
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,192
Karl Malone
was the MVP that year.

209
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:42,154
Here was added motivation for Michael.
He thought he should've been MVP.

210
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:45,741
So, we knew immediately
where this was going.

211
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,786
I'm not saying
he wasn't deserving of it.

212
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,413
All I'm saying is that
that fueled the fire in me.

213
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,875
I said, "Okay. You think he's MVP.
Okay, fine. No problem."

214
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,546
This team likes to run, they need to get
easy baskets for them to score.

215
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,381
They gotta get 100 points.

216
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:03,259
Remember, this team is second
in the league in scoring.

217
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,845
They have a pretty potent offense
when they run.

218
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:13,185
<i>It is game one
of the NBA Finals.</i>

219
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:16,522
<i>For the Utah Jazz,
it is their first trip to the Finals</i>

220
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:19,692
<i>in the history of the franchise.</i>

221
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:20,775
<i>Game one.</i>

222
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,071
<i>Here's Jordan... Yes!</i>

223
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:29,368
<i>Karl Malone with a nice lead
for John Stockton.</i>

224
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,035
Defense!

225
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:33,873
<i>The lead for Malone,
off the pick and roll.</i>

226
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,142
<i>Karl Malone
very aggressive offensively.</i>

227
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,543
The Jazz were good, man.

228
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,504
Freaking Karl Malone,
he's a bad match-up for us.

229
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:43,215
<i>Down to three.
Malone... Yes.</i>

230
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,843
John Stockton's a bad matchup.

231
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:49,930
So that first game in Chicago was close.

232
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:53,350
<i>The game is tied at 82.</i>

233
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,563
<i>Down to 7.5 seconds remaining.</i>

234
00:14:57,646 --> 00:15:00,858
<i>They got Bryon Russell on Michael Jordan.</i>

235
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:02,568
We had probably

236
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:05,863
three guys that were typically assigned
to match up with Michael,

237
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:08,657
and Bryon Russell would have been
first and foremost.

238
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,577
Bryon Russell made our team
in the first place through

239
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,621
incredible effort defensively.

240
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:18,709
So he earned the right to take on
some of the tougher assignments,

241
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:20,669
and it doesn't get any tougher
than Michael.

242
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,841
Yeah. Bryon Russell?

243
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,846
When I was playing baseball,
Utah's in town to play the Bulls.

244
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,766
They're practicing at the facility.

245
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:36,602
I go over to say hello to John and Karl.

246
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,773
This kid, Bryon Russell, comes up to me,
says, "Man, why you quit?

247
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:44,944
Why you quit? Man, you knew I could
guard your ass. You had to quit."

248
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,613
I said, "Karl, you need to talk
to this dude, man."

249
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:49,490
"Nah, he's just a young rookie."

250
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,160
But from that point on,
he's been on my list.

251
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:57,539
Bryon's a very playful guy,
and he said things all the time.

252
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,084
I have no doubt
Michael had a number of edges

253
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:03,337
that he could have sharpened
for whatever reason.

254
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,548
I knew how he played.

255
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,301
You know,
he played on the front of his toes.

256
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,638
Give him a head-and-shoulder fake,
go one way, he can't stop.

257
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,519
<i>They're with
Shandon Anderson to guard Scottie Pippen.</i>

258
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:21,146
<i>They got Bryon Russell on Michael Jordan.</i>

259
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,608
<i>We're down to five.
Jordan putting moves on Russell.</i>

260
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,652
<i>We're down to two. Now one...</i>

261
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:35,327
<i>It's all over! The Bulls
have won at the buzzer in game one.</i>

262
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:38,414
<i>The jump shot by Michael Jordan.</i>

263
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:06,066
Game two was... not particularly close.

264
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,194
<i>Oh, is Michael Jordan feeling it now!</i>

265
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,947
<i>Bulls blew out the Jazz 97-85</i>

266
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,408
<i>to take a 2-0 lead in that series.</i>

267
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:18,871
But... you know, Utah fights.

268
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:22,332
They go out to Utah,
and it's a different story.

269
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,793
<i>Setting up Malone...</i>

270
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:29,173
<i>Karl Malone went off, 37 points.</i>

271
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:33,510
<i>Jazz win it 104-93. They now trail
in the series, two games to one.</i>

272
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:38,140
So, game four of that series,
it's a tight game.

273
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,392
<i>It's a one-point Chicago lead.</i>

274
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,312
<i>Just under one minute remaining.</i>

275
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:48,150
Stockton throws the single best pass
I've ever seen a point guard throw.

276
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:54,490
<i>Game four of the NBA Finals
with the Bulls up two games to one.</i>

277
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,244
<i>Stockton fires down to Malone!</i>

278
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:12,174
<i>And the series is tied at two!</i>

279
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:23,352
Before game five in Utah,
I'm at the Marriott.

280
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:31,652
So it was George, myself, Tim,
and I think a couple of security guys.

281
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:35,614
The night before the game,
we're all in Michael's room, hanging out.

282
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:39,535
But it's like 10:00, 10:30 at night,
I'm hungry.

283
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,496
No room service. Michael gets hungry.

284
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,041
So we're calling
all these different places.

285
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:50,045
George and I are looking around,
we find one pizza place open. One.

286
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:54,007
So he ordered a pizza,
and when the pizza came,

287
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:56,593
there was four or five guys
outside the door.

288
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,971
Five guys delivering one pizza.

289
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,058
You know, it's very rare
that you get five delivery guys

290
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,602
from the pizza place
to bring you your pizza.

291
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:08,897
And they're all trying to look in,
and everybody knew it's Mike.

292
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,359
So I take the pizza, I pay them,
and I put this pizza down,

293
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,611
and I said,
"I got a bad feeling about this."

294
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:18,490
I ate the pizza. All by myself.
Nobody else ate the pizza.

295
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:23,287
I wake up about 2:30,
throwing up left and right.

296
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:27,624
It's three o'clock in the morning.
I get a call in my room.

297
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,376
"Hey, man, come to the room right now."

298
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:34,173
All right, I get in to him. He's literally
curled up in a ball, shaking.

299
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,218
He goes, "Man, find the team doc, now."

300
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:41,972
So really, it wasn't the flu game,
it was food poisoning.

301
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:46,935
Oh, my heavens.

302
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,563
I was in the room in Utah.

303
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:52,733
And I went over, and he says,
"Oh, I'm so sick."

304
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:56,111
I said, "How are you gonna play tonight?"
"Mom, I have to play."

305
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,655
And I'm thinking, "You should not play."

306
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:02,117
But when we went to the stadium,
there he was.

307
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,041
<i>Now the big story here tonight,</i>

308
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:06,371
<i>Michael Jordan's physical condition.</i>

309
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,332
Guys, look out behind.

310
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:10,215
- <i>I stayed in bed all day.</i>
- Come on.

311
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,363
<i>Couldn't eat anything,
couldn't hold nothing down.</i>

312
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,841
He had an IV hooked up to him,
and he was chalky white.

313
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:19,801
Didn't look good.

314
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:23,055
And I was like,
"Oh, boy, we're in trouble."

315
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:26,725
Phil comes in, "What do you think?"
I said, "I'm gonna try. It's game five.

316
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:30,270
If anything, I can be a decoy.
So, I'm going out. I'm gonna play."

317
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:33,541
<i>At 3:30 this morning,
Michael Jordan woke up</i>

318
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:34,650
<i>with flu-like symptoms.</i>

319
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,402
<i>He had a stomachache and a headache.
He couldn't go back to sleep.</i>

320
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:40,948
<i>He threw up all night. And as reported
earlier, he missed his shootaround.</i>

321
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:44,243
<i>But he was in bed all day
and continued to throw up.</i>

322
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:49,498
Utah Jazz! Utah Jazz! Utah Jazz!

323
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:01,343
<i>Utah Jazz control the tip.</i>

324
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,720
<i>The key
for Utah tonight is offense.</i>

325
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,555
<i>Stockton got the stuff.</i>

326
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,725
<i>Utah's got the quick start</i>

327
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,727
<i>that they needed
to keep the crowd into it.</i>

328
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:14,064
<i>Jordan to the crossover...</i>

329
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:18,068
<i>Way off.
Visibly shaken by the flu symptoms.</i>

330
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,570
<i>This is an ugly start
for Chicago.</i>

331
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:23,824
He'd be out there on the floor playing,
a whistle would blow for a timeout.

332
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:25,408
And you could see,

333
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,662
it was like the life just went out
of his body inside, and he just...

334
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:34,626
Every timeout,
he was just, like... gassed.

335
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:40,007
He was in pretty bad shape...

336
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,760
but, you know,
a lot of times when you're sick...

337
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:49,558
you're able to find something deep down
inside that you didn't know was there.

338
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,977
And I think it was just one of those games

339
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:56,815
where he wanted to win so badly that,

340
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:59,234
you know, he stayed with it.

341
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:03,530
After that timeout,
when that whistle blew,

342
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:07,367
somehow, somewhere...
he got up and played.

343
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:11,747
<i>Michael Jordan is back,
putting the move on Chris Morris.</i>

344
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,916
<i>Jordan puts moves on Hornacek.</i>

345
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,628
<i>And this the best spurt of the night.</i>

346
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,134
<i>Jordan finding Longley.</i>

347
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:28,096
<i>And the Jazz now leading by just nine.</i>

348
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,451
- He's like the Terminator.
<i>- Steal by Jordan!</i>

349
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:36,104
He went somewhere
and he found... a switch.

350
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:40,317
<i>What a play! And the Bulls
actually have a chance to take the lead.</i>

351
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:46,865
At the end of that game,
he started rising up

352
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:48,492
and making shots...

353
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:50,994
and carrying that team.

354
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:54,706
<i>And the game
is tied at 85.</i>

355
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:58,293
<i>The Bulls
have been here year after year.</i>

356
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:01,380
<i>The confidence, the poise,
the determination,</i>

357
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,882
<i>the discipline and organization
down the stretch,</i>

358
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:07,844
<i>all paying off right now
with Jordan masterfully at the line.</i>

359
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,810
<i>Jordan able to scoop up the loose ball</i>

360
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:18,271
<i>for the possession
with 40 seconds remaining.</i>

361
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,857
<i>The game tied at 85.</i>

362
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:30,283
<i>Ten on the shot clock.
Pippen backing Hornacek.</i>

363
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,868
<i>Here's Jordan for three.</i>

364
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:32,952
<i>Yes!</i>

365
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,789
<i>Michael Jordan from straight away.</i>

366
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:04,276
He had shown that no matter
how sick he was...

367
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:06,653
he's still the best player in the world.

368
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,627
Coach,
how much did you know about

369
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,546
Jordan's condition going into the game?

370
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:27,132
What did he look like early?
And describe the effort

371
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:29,926
that he put forth
with the illness that he had.

372
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,720
First of all, I didn't know he's sick.

373
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:36,558
And I thought he played a great game.

374
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:43,440
Did everybody else know he was sick?

375
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:46,776
I guess I was the last one to know.

376
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:54,993
- Come on, chief?
- Are you crazy?

377
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:06,421
My innate personality
is to win at all costs.

378
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,632
If I have to do it myself,
I'm gonna do it.

379
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:12,093
But over the period
of getting to the Finals,

380
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:17,265
there have been moments that other guys
really expanded their games.

381
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:23,313
I think Michael recognized
that there were guys

382
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:25,398
who were sort of overachievers.

383
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:31,446
Guys who maybe don't have the star power,
but came in and did what we could.

384
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:34,241
Which I'm sure he looked at me
as an overachiever.

385
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,662
Coming into the NBA,

386
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:42,874
I was not a high draft pick
or a highly-touted player.

387
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:47,546
Phoenix drafted me, gave me a chance
and kept me around for a year.

388
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:51,383
And my first real break in the NBA
was with the Cleveland Cavaliers.

389
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:55,929
<i>...against Kerr.
They swing to Kerr, he steps up and fires.</i>

390
00:25:56,012 --> 00:26:00,892
We played the Bulls a lot,
and I used to watch John Paxson.

391
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,144
I used to guard him
when we played the Bulls,

392
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,814
and then I'd watch him on TV
when we would prepare for them.

393
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,440
<i>Paxson for three...</i>

394
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:11,486
<i>Yes! The Bulls take a one-point lead.</i>

395
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,113
John was my guy.

396
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:17,158
I kept thinking...
"That's the spot I need to be."

397
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:19,911
By the time I got there,

398
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:23,373
John was entering the final year
of his career.

399
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:25,834
And he kinda took me under his wing.

400
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:29,921
I learned early in my career
that I was gonna be a role player.

401
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:33,258
What I did well... complemented Michael.

402
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:37,012
So, I tried to tell Steve about

403
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:41,933
how Michael had to really trust
who you were out there.

404
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,935
If he was gonna go to battle with you,

405
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:46,813
he had to know you were in it
and you weren't gonna back down.

406
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:52,068
I had to fight and scrap and claw
for everything I got in the NBA.

407
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,531
And that was just enough to make it.

408
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,701
Oh, man,
you gotta call that shit.

409
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,411
- I got half...
- It's all good.

410
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:05,540
Michael lived a different life
than the rest of us, out of necessity.

411
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:09,419
He couldn't live that normal life.
It was very difficult to reach him...

412
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:12,631
emotionally.

413
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:15,176
Did you ever discuss your fathers?

414
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:17,344
We never discussed that.

415
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:23,725
I think it was probably too painful, um...
for each of us.

416
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:39,282
My dad supported me when I was a kid.
He saw how much I loved sports.

417
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:41,451
He loved basketball,
he loved watching me play.

418
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:45,580
We played together all the time,
out in the driveway.

419
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:47,415
His competitiveness
was honed...

420
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:52,671
by playing basketball in the driveway
with his father and his older brother.

421
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,923
That's where the family action was:

422
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:58,635
Malcolm, John and Steve
playing basketball.

423
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:00,970
Naturally, they would sometimes win.

424
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,598
And that hurt him. Oh, oh!

425
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,600
It was terrible.

426
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,269
My dad was a professor

427
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:11,022
of Middle East history
and politics at UCLA.

428
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,482
My mom was a full-time mom,

429
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:15,527
but she became a professor
later on in life.

430
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:18,071
So a very academically-minded family.

431
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:21,282
Monday through Thursday,
we were not allowed to watch TV

432
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:25,537
unless there was a really big game on,
so my dad came in handy on those nights.

433
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:32,085
My dad's affiliation with UCLA
stoked my fire for basketball.

434
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:35,505
Going to Pauley Pavilion in the early '70s

435
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:38,800
as a five, six-year-old kid,
it was like magic.

436
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,261
It was an incredible place to be.

437
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:44,848
<i>Walton shoots and hits
the short shot from the left baseline.</i>

438
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:48,494
What kind of attention
did you get from college scouts

439
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:50,854
- when you were coming out of high school?
- Very little.

440
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:54,899
Um, about the same attention that I was
getting from girls in high school.

441
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:58,737
So, not many girls, not many
college recruiters, so...

442
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:02,532
I finished my senior year of high school
without a scholarship,

443
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:06,244
but Arizona offered me a scholarship
kind of at the last second,

444
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:09,748
and I took it without ever
having visited the school.

445
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:12,333
I was just thrilled to have a place to go.

446
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,461
And then when I went off to college,

447
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:18,173
my mom and my younger brother went
and joined my dad in Beirut.

448
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:23,803
My dad left UCLA
before I graduated high school,

449
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:26,765
and became the president
of the American University in Beirut.

450
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:29,309
<i>In the chapel of
American University of Beirut,</i>

451
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:32,353
<i>the 117th school year officially began.</i>

452
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:35,732
<i>With the summer of fighting in Beirut,
it almost didn't occur.</i>

453
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:39,277
<i>AUB's acting president was kidnapped
from the campus three months ago</i>

454
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,528
<i>and is still missing.</i>

455
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:43,782
<i>AUB's new president believes
Dodge is still alive.</i>

456
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:47,243
I was looking forward
to working with him as vice president.

457
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,454
If I'd gotten here on time
on the 1st of July,

458
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:52,123
it might've been me instead of him
who was kidnapped.

459
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:55,752
He was a really good scholar
of the Middle East.

460
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:58,046
He was trying to produce students

461
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:02,675
that were tolerant, globally-minded,
humanitarian citizens.

462
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:07,096
So, it was a realization of a dream...

463
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,557
but it didn't last very long.

464
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:13,186
The international peacekeeping force
left the Beirut area last year,

465
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:16,731
and life in the Lebanese capital
has become increasingly dangerous.

466
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,775
It's bad for almost everyone
who lives there,

467
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:21,319
but it is especially bad for Americans.

468
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:24,405
Malcolm was the visible American.

469
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,616
He was representing a government

470
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:31,871
that stood for values that were contrary
to the sectarian militia.

471
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:37,252
What do you remember
about that day in 1984?

472
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:41,965
Well, it was raining.

473
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:43,633
I'd just taught my class.

474
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:48,847
I got a call from the guard
at the gate to, um...

475
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:54,936
go to the president's office,
and I went there, and, um...

476
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:58,982
I was told that Malcolm had been shot,
on the phone...

477
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:01,651
and I thought maybe just a leg or an arm.

478
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:06,489
The president of the American University
in Beirut was shot in the head

479
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:08,867
by two gunmen posing as students.

480
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,578
Malcolm Kerr
had just gotten off an elevator

481
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:14,914
and was about to go into a meeting
on campus when he was killed.

482
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:21,713
Uh, so, I received a phone call in the
middle of the night from a family friend.

483
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:25,550
My phone rang in my dorm
at three o'clock in the morning,

484
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:28,303
so I knew something was up, and...

485
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,847
And he just said...

486
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:34,767
He just said,
"Steve, I have terrible news."

487
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,020
So...

488
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:41,481
Yeah.

489
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:46,195
<i>The murdered academic
had long been popular</i>

490
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,530
<i>with his colleagues in Beirut.</i>

491
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:48,865
<i>Though he was an American,</i>

492
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:51,659
<i>his roots within the Arab world
were just as strong.</i>

493
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:56,039
Basketball was the one thing
that I could do

494
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:58,458
to take my mind off
what happened, you know?

495
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,125
Um...

496
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:06,883
So, I went to practice the next day.
I didn't know what else to do.

497
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:11,554
We all react differently to these things.

498
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:18,895
Steve reacted by throwing himself
even more deeply into playing basketball.

499
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,565
I used to think about it all the time
when I was playing.

500
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,944
During the national anthem,
I would always...

501
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:30,239
think about my dad
and think he would love this right now.

502
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:31,741
He wouldn't even believe it.

503
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:33,701
He would love this.

504
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:44,128
<i>♪ By the dawn's early light ♪</i>

505
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:48,967
<i>♪ What so proudly we hailed ♪</i>

506
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:53,221
<i>♪ At the twilight's last gleaming? ♪</i>

507
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:56,432
<i>♪ Whose broad stripes
And bright stars... ♪</i>

508
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:59,477
<i>And the latest
on Michael Jordan's physical condition.</i>

509
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,729
<i>Jordan feeling much better.</i>

510
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:05,858
<i>He's apparently made it back
from the difficult siege with the flu.</i>

511
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:09,070
I sense that Michael Jordan
is almost out of gas

512
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:12,240
and will make a concerted effort
to end it tonight

513
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:14,450
to avoid a seventh-game showdown.

514
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:19,080
<i>Chicago starting slowly,
and Utah is taking advantage of that.</i>

515
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,290
<i>Hornacek... Yes!</i>

516
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:22,750
<i>Look out, Chicago.</i>

517
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,634
<i>It's not gonna be easy
wrapping it up tonight.</i>

518
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:27,171
<i>Karl Malone
with 12 points.</i>

519
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:31,384
<i>The Jazz leading 46-39.</i>

520
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:36,222
The ultimate trust from Michael
comes in the playoffs if you come through.

521
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:38,975
I think he respected me

522
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:41,602
because he knew I fought,
and I was competitive,

523
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,772
and I worked,
and I got the most out of myself,

524
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:47,483
but I hadn't performed very well
in the Finals.

525
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:49,819
<i>That's a good block there.</i>

526
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,113
<i>Kerr for three!</i>

527
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:57,035
I was struggling, and, you know,
I was so hard on myself.

528
00:33:57,577 --> 00:34:00,788
As a role player,
I'd get five shots a game.

529
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,833
And so every shot
took on way too much importance.

530
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,879
<i>Jordan... Yes!</i>

531
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:12,258
<i>The Bulls 86-83.</i>

532
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:15,136
The Jazz tied the game
with less than two minutes to play.

533
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:18,931
<i>Hornacek gotta save
that pass... Russell for three!</i>

534
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:24,604
<i>An enormous shot by Bryon Russell.
He's tied the game at 86.</i>

535
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:28,149
Phil calls timeout,
and Michael knew what was coming.

536
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:30,651
Earlier in the series,

537
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,779
in a very similar situation
late in the game,

538
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:35,656
John Stockton had come over
and doubled him and stolen the ball,

539
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,825
which helped seal the win for Utah.

540
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:41,496
He mumbled something like,
"Hey, Steve, Steve, be ready."

541
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:46,667
<i>He knew the camera was always on him...
you know, and I'm oblivious.</i>

542
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,628
He comes off, I'll be ready.

543
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:51,964
And then I'm yelling back,
"I'll be ready, I'll be ready!"

544
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:08,689
I know if they're gonna double-team me,
Steve's gonna be open.

545
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:11,109
<i>It is Michael Jordan time.</i>

546
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:14,153
<i>Did not have the shot, Kerr does.</i>

547
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:18,157
<i>Steve Kerr with five seconds remaining!</i>

548
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:25,081
<i>Kerr hits the big shot,
cranked up the John Paxson '93 comparison.</i>

549
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:27,542
<i>One last chance now for Utah.</i>

550
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:31,170
<i>Five seconds remaining
in regulation.</i>

551
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:33,214
<i>Inbound... Stolen by Pippen.</i>

552
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,091
<i>Pippen rolls it to Kukoc.</i>

553
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:37,635
<i>And the Chicago Bulls</i>

554
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:43,057
<i>have won their fifth championship
in the last seven years.</i>

555
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:47,436
<i>Just six tenths of a second remaining.
It's a four-point lead.</i>

556
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:52,900
Whoo-hoo!

557
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:07,748
Tonight, Steve Kerr earned his wings,
and I'm very happy for Steve.

558
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,555
<i>And now...</i>

559
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:27,852
<i>your 1997 world champions!</i>

560
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:35,776
A lot of people have been asking me
about the shot the other night,

561
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,654
and there've been some misconceptions
about what actually happened.

562
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:39,947
I wanted to clear it up.

563
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:43,492
When we called timeout
with 25 seconds to go...

564
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:45,912
we went into the huddle,

565
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:49,582
and Phil told Michael, he said, "Michael,
I want you to take the last shot."

566
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:53,920
And Michael said, "Phil, I don't feel
real comfortable in these situations.

567
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:57,757
So, maybe we oughta go
in another direction.

568
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:00,551
Why don't we go to Steve?"

569
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:08,434
So I thought to myself, "Well, I guess
I gotta bail Michael out again."

570
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:13,022
Anyway, the shot went in,

571
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:15,942
and that's my story,
and I'm sticking to it.

572
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:51,018
<i>It is game seven in Chicago.</i>

573
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:55,022
<i>This could be the last time
we see the Bulls as we know them.</i>

574
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:59,360
The dynasty's been shoved up
to the brink. Game seven with the Pacers.

575
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:02,822
If the unthinkable occurs
and the Bulls do go down in flames,

576
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:07,076
life might return to the pre-Jordan days,
also known as the Tom Boerwinkle era.

577
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,847
It's bigger than just being
knocked out of the playoffs.

578
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:12,957
It's the end of an era.

579
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:15,626
I told them today that you can lose.

580
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:18,754
You have to face the possibility
you can lose a game like this.

581
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:21,757
Everybody thought
if the Bulls were to be broken up,

582
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:23,050
the dynasty was to be ended,

583
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:26,470
it would be ended
by somebody in a suit someplace.

584
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:30,891
There'd be more closure and more justice
if it happened on the floor.

585
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,771
<i>Mr. Jordan is taking a page
from Joe Namath's book.</i>

586
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:38,441
<i>We all remember he predicted
the Jets would win Super Bowl III.</i>

587
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:42,611
We're gonna win game seven.
We will win game seven.

588
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:48,826
At that time, I hung around
with my security guys, with George.

589
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,954
They became my "entourage."

590
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:55,666
I knew that the maturity
that I gathered from them

591
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,085
would help me make sound decisions.

592
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:04,675
I needed good, sound, open-minded
older guys saying... keeping my focus.

593
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,594
Relax. Relax...

594
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:12,892
Michael had a real warm spot
with his security guards,

595
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:14,560
and the head of them was Gus.

596
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:22,026
Gus was a Chicago police officer,
and I guess, back in his younger days,

597
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:24,153
he was pretty badass back in the day

598
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:26,572
and very well-respected
in the Chicago Police Department.

599
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:31,410
He started as a patrolman and he worked
his way up and became sergeant.

600
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:35,247
He and some of his friends worked
for the United Center as security.

601
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:40,711
Gus befriended Michael when he first
came to Chicago, when he broke his foot.

602
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:44,965
That's when
Gus would meet me at the car

603
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:48,886
and make sure I get to my seat and get to
the locker room. We spent time together.

604
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:54,058
And from then on, it started to grow.
He was a great protector for me.

605
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:56,769
- Excuse us. Excuse me.
- No, we gotta go.

606
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:59,706
He wouldn't let anybody through
that wasn't supposed to go through there.

607
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,983
Listen, everybody. Can we move this way
and spread out a little?

608
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,485
Nothing got past Gus.

609
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,906
When people around, they think
they're entitled to certain things.

610
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:11,117
Gus would put 'em straight.

611
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:14,578
That was Gus. He's a protector.

612
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:20,042
But he was more than that,
and I saw him for being more than that.

613
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:25,756
At that time,
Michael was hurt about his dad.

614
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,883
He still had a hard time with his death.

615
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,760
And he would call him...

616
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:34,265
crying at two o'clock in the morning.
Gus would get up and go to him.

617
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:36,809
He would get up and go see about him.

618
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:39,687
He was there for whatever he needed.
He was there to take care of him.

619
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:45,734
When my father got killed,
he became like a father figure to me.

620
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:49,280
I had to have him next to me
everywhere I went.

621
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:59,994
Gus, can I throw a couple questions
at you while you're relaxing there?

622
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:03,043
Yeah. The chemo, I can't hear real well,
so you gotta...

623
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:05,212
- Can I throw some questions at you?
- Sure.

624
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:08,883
When Gus got sick, um...

625
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:13,220
Mike was the first one
to notice him being sick.

626
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:15,723
They were traveling someplace.
He called me to tell me that.

627
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:18,225
He said, "Tish, you gotta take him
to the doctor."

628
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:23,063
Gus was diagnosed with lung cancer,
and Michael was there.

629
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:27,735
He was there in the hospital with us.
He was there in my home.

630
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:31,822
He was there calling.
As I said, he was there for him.

631
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:35,493
Well, he... He got cancer and...

632
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:39,538
He took a leave of absence from us
and went for his treatments.

633
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:43,250
So, when Gus came back before game seven,

634
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:46,378
he looked frail, but he had that Gus,
that smile on,

635
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:49,840
and it was kind of like we got the band
back together kind of thing.

636
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:53,761
Hey! How you doing, Gus?
Welcome back, buddy.

637
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,721
- Vacation's over?
- Yeah.

638
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:58,557
- Get you back to work.
- For the time being anyway.

639
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:01,143
He was inspiration for me.

640
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,979
I wanted to win this game for Gus.

641
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:12,780
It'll be interesting.
Let's see what happens.

642
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:15,282
Nut crunchin' time.

643
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:21,163
Some can... some can't.

644
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:25,042
That's the way it look like to me.

645
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:26,794
Some can, some can't?

646
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:30,130
Some can, some can't.

647
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:33,384
That's just the way it is.

648
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:37,888
- Stay away from Scott Burrell.
- I...

649
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,932
You're not instructed
to talk to Burrell.

650
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:41,475
You'll scare the shit out of him.

651
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:50,027
Knowing that we was going
to a game seven,

652
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:52,695
had an opportunity to knock
Michael out of the playoffs

653
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:54,154
was pretty special for that group.

654
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:57,950
We hadn't been tested like that
in a long time.

655
00:42:58,033 --> 00:43:02,329
We were all mentally exhausted,
you know, physically exhausted.

656
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:06,709
All right, baby, there's no tomorrow.
Let's go out and do it.

657
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:08,794
Let's leave everything
on this fucking floor.

658
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:26,020
Defense. Defense wins it now.
Rebound and defend.

659
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,064
<i>Miller lobs to Smits.</i>

660
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:32,693
<i>He finds Dale Davis,
who gets inside for the dunk.</i>

661
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:35,571
<i>Michael with his back to the basket,
guarded by Miller.</i>

662
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:38,407
<i>Spins into the lane,
and misses the jumper.</i>

663
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:41,035
In a game seven, anything is possible.

664
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:43,537
You rip up game plans,

665
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,748
because in a game seven,
it doesn't matter.

666
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:48,083
It's all whoever wants it more.

667
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:51,730
<i>It's Kukoc alone on him,
now Harper comes on the double.</i>

668
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:55,132
<i>Davis hits the turnaround,
and the Pacers lead by a dozen.</i>

669
00:43:57,509 --> 00:44:01,263
We were down 12 right away.
The first quarter, they came out on fire.

670
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:04,141
We had to claw our way back in.

671
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:07,770
<i>Two on that break, Michael to Pippen...</i>

672
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:12,775
<i>Jordan back the other way.
It's Kerr, his three...</i>

673
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:13,858
<i>It's there!</i>

674
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:19,573
<i>Jordan splits the defense
and ties the game!</i>

675
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:23,535
<i>Michael Jordan is now
the all-time leading postseason scorer.</i>

676
00:44:26,538 --> 00:44:29,917
<i>Jordan... to the hoop,
then dishes it out to Pippen.</i>

677
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,086
<i>Cross-court Kerr, open three...</i>

678
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:39,468
We got back into the game, and...
I thought we were gonna pull away.

679
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:42,831
- <i>Around a Davis screen...
- </i>But they made a great comeback.

680
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:44,890
<i>...evens the issue at 69!</i>

681
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:50,104
<i>Chicago once led by as many as 8.
Indiana is on an 11-0 run.</i>

682
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:55,693
<i>And the Bulls wanna talk it over.</i>

683
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,320
When they called timeout...

684
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:01,031
I just remember just jumping,
giving high fives,

685
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:03,575
chest bumping, like,
"We got this. Hell, yeah!"

686
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:06,412
You guys can switch
on this thing if you need to.

687
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:08,372
I'm not switching, Phil. I won't do it.

688
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:10,791
I'm chasing.
I'm not switching nothing off.

689
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:13,460
Move the ball ahead of the foul.

690
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:16,839
Look, six minutes left in game seven,
I thought Indy was going to win.

691
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:19,508
<i>Fourth quarter, we're down.</i>

692
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:23,429
<i>You know, the thought ran through my mind,
"Man, this could be it."</i>

693
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:27,766
<i>Jordan, knocked away by McKey cleanly...</i>

694
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,768
<i>And a jump ball is called.</i>

695
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:35,858
We had the lead,
but it came down to one jump ball.

696
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:38,815
<i>How big is this jump ball right now?</i>

697
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:41,021
<i>You get this jump ball,
you got a chance to go up five.</i>

698
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:45,701
If we win that jump ball,
and go down and score and go up five...

699
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:47,870
this could be it for them.

700
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:50,581
<i>Michael can really jump,
but Smits is 7'4".</i>

701
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:52,541
<i>Smits tipped it, but right to Pippen.</i>

702
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:55,502
They win the jump ball...

703
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:58,881
it finds the hands of Steve Kerr...

704
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:03,093
<i>Kerr can tie it...</i>

705
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:04,761
<i>and does!</i>

706
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:07,848
<i>Steve Kerr,
he's been big today.</i>

707
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:09,808
<i>This is his 11th point of the game.</i>

708
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:14,104
Steve Kerr hit the biggest shot
of that series.

709
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:17,816
And to me, I think that's where
everything went downhill for us.

710
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,276
It changed everything.

711
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:24,114
All of a sudden, a volt of electricity
went through the building.

712
00:46:24,656 --> 00:46:26,033
<i>Pippen...</i>

713
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:28,410
<i>Chicago leads with five on the shot clock.</i>

714
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:30,954
<i>Michael dumps it off to an open Longley.</i>

715
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:34,541
<i>And the Bulls have a little bit
of breathing room.</i>

716
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:36,251
<i>Ahead by four.</i>

717
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:40,881
<i>They look for Smits and Harper deflects it
and comes up with a steal.</i>

718
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:45,010
It was like we were a ninth-grade
JV team that had no shot.

719
00:46:45,093 --> 00:46:48,764
<i>Throws up a little hook.
It bounces home, plus a foul.</i>

720
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:58,941
<i>And onto the Finals,
for the sixth time in eight years,</i>

721
00:46:59,024 --> 00:47:00,526
<i>go the Chicago Bulls.</i>

722
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:08,283
We had the better team,
I really do believe that,

723
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:12,412
but championship DNA
and championship experience...

724
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:17,459
really rose to the forefront
in game seven for Chicago.

725
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:26,176
You know what was great?

726
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:30,222
Not only did the team win, but...

727
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:33,350
Michael snatched the game ball for me.

728
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:37,437
That's... that's all right.
It's all right.

729
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,439
We got four more, dog. Four more.

730
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:41,441
Four more, this shit is hard.

731
00:47:42,484 --> 00:47:44,987
We can't wait to smile
at the end of the day.

732
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:46,196
Way to go, D-Rod.

733
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:51,410
- Big shots, boy.
- Thank you.

734
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:53,745
Way to go, Luc.
Way to come in, Jud.

735
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:54,913
That's huge.

736
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:58,917
That's huge, man. It's the hardest
we worked in, shit, 13 years.

737
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:00,669
Goddamn!

738
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:02,670
Whoo!

739
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:06,967
I had to bring in the ace in the hole
for us to win the game.

740
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:08,050
Yeah.

741
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:10,554
That's why we struggling,
your ass ain't around no more.

742
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:13,098
Got to take you out to the Utah.

743
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:19,187
Enjoy yourself, dog.

744
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:21,398
You bitch, fuck you.

745
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:24,860
- Y'all gave us a run for our money.
- Yeah. I'll see ya.

746
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:27,946
All right, take care. Now you can
work on that golf game of yours.
