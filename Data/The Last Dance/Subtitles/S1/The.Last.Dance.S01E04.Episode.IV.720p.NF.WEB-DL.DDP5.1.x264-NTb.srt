1
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:24,733
I do remember being in Vegas with him.

2
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:26,234
It was on!

3
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:28,611
The party was starting right away.

4
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:32,782
Mixin' it up. Bring on the shookers!

5
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,701
That's whores and sluts,
you're gonna learn.

6
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:36,828
- That's smart hookers.
- Yeah.

7
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:37,911
Wow.

8
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:44,210
<i>One thing about Dennis: he had to escape.</i>

9
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:46,880
He'd like to go out.
He liked to go to clubs.

10
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:51,134
We'd go to his favorite restaurant,
then we'd go to a nightclub,

11
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:53,094
then we'd go to after hours.
It didn't stop.

12
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:58,224
It's all about getting
your groove on, right?

13
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:02,687
It was definitely an occupational hazard
to be Dennis' girlfriend.

14
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:05,648
He was wild.

15
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:11,154
<i>♪ It's Kamikaze time ♪</i>

16
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,406
<i>♪ It's time to blow your mind ♪</i>

17
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,742
<i>♪ It's Kamikaze time ♪</i>

18
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:17,285
Suck it down, motherfucker!

19
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:23,541
But to be honest, I didn't realize
what the team's schedule was.

20
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,710
I didn't know he took a detour.

21
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,052
Did Dennis
come back on time?

22
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:35,512
Mmm-mmm.

23
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:39,099
He didn't come back on time.
We had to go get his ass out of bed.

24
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:43,394
And I'm not gonna say what's in his bed
and where he was and blah, blah, blah.

25
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,898
There's a knock on the door.
It's Michael Jordan,

26
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:48,358
and I hid.

27
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:52,904
I didn't want him
to see me like that, so I...

28
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:55,865
I'm just hiding behind the couch
with covers over me.

29
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,701
"Come on, you...
We gotta get to practice."

30
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,412
Dennis came back and joined the team.

31
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,541
And that's the way it went that year.

32
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:08,813
I wanted to tell you...

33
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,922
Did you get your body
through anything today, Dennis?

34
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:15,051
You gotta put your body through things
so the muscles have a memorization, too.

35
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:20,974
His body made it here, Phil.
Don't beg for too much.

36
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,811
Michael and Scottie
accepted me for who I am.

37
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:30,150
They say, "You know what? He does
what he does, but he cares a lot."

38
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,319
I go party hard, but I work hard.

39
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:38,241
I think that we get along so well because
we wanna win. We wanna win a championship.

40
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:44,914
Kamikaze.

41
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,378
<i>A spectacular move!</i>

42
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:51,963
<i>The game's over!</i>

43
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:54,382
<i>Chicago Stadium is going wild!</i>

44
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:58,782
<i>First of all, there's
no backstabbing going on here.</i>

45
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,263
<i>It's time for me to move on.</i>

46
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,746
<i>This will be Phil's last year
as coach of the Bulls.</i>

47
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,413
- <i>Are the expectations too high?
- Where do we go from here?</i>

48
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:10,231
<i>The only question:
how long can it last?</i>

49
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:56,444
After his vacation,
Dennis comes back to practice.

50
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:00,448
Phil's now... His whole motive
is to get Dennis back in shape.

51
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,535
So, we start this drill
called the Indian drill.

52
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,205
Everybody starts running in a line.

53
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:12,418
And Phil blows a whistle.
Whoever's at the back, run to the front.

54
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:16,589
Now, you can't stop.
Whoever's in front controls the pace.

55
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,217
So, I'm saying,
"Fuck, this is kind of messed up,"

56
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:23,054
because now I'm getting caught up
in "Dennis getting in shape drill,"

57
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:25,056
when in essence,
I hadn't taken a vacation.

58
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:29,102
So I tell everybody in that group, "Look,
whoever gets in the front of that row,

59
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:31,020
slow down to a fucking walk.

60
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:34,107
We just gonna jog and jog
and jog and jog."

61
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:41,572
So, Steve Kerr and Jud Buechler,
they all get to the line, we just slowly,

62
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:44,867
we just running, slowly just running,
and then,

63
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,286
Dennis takes off. Boom!

64
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,704
Now, he blows the whistle.

65
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:51,666
Now, we cannot stop
until we get back in front of Dennis.

66
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:54,127
It took us four laps
to catch up to Dennis.

67
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,547
It was in his psyche.
He needed to get away.

68
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,841
But, in all honesty,
Dennis was always there.

69
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:01,592
He was always on point.

70
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:09,434
Phil realized
that I was different, man.

71
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:13,354
Phil knew me so well,
'cause he knew I...

72
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:17,066
So much shit I was doing.
But I had to get my head right.

73
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,861
But that's what's so cool about
playing with that team,

74
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:24,532
and they was all about... Anybody needed
to do something, they was all about it.

75
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:26,034
And Phil was cool about it.

76
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,871
Dennis is always a rebel, at some point.

77
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:33,833
He wants to join the group, but the other
part of him wants to be autonomous.

78
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,795
So, we appreciate the fact
that he's a maverick.

79
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:41,049
But yet, when it comes time
for him to perform,

80
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,968
he's always on the court for us,
always playing hard for us.

81
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,555
Dennis and I have this...

82
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,975
Native American bond between us.

83
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:56,606
He comes in one day,
and Dennis and I met in the team room.

84
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:59,317
In the team room,
I have a bear claw necklace,

85
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,570
a turtle shell that came from
another Indian reservation,

86
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,198
and various other Indian artifacts.

87
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,495
And so, Dennis is like, "Wow."

88
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:14,415
He said, "I have this necklace from
the Ponca Indians in Oklahoma.

89
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,501
I can... I'm hip to that."

90
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:21,214
And I say, "Dennis, in their tradition,
and the tradition that I knew,

91
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:24,342
you would be a <i>heyoka,</i>
a backward-walking person.

92
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:27,387
There were people that were different,
and you're a <i>heyoka.</i>

93
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,597
So, you're this <i>heyoka</i> in this tribe."

94
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,432
He don't look at me
as a basketball player.

95
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,853
He look at me as a great friend.

96
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:39,399
He realized that I probably needed him
for inspiration.

97
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,277
He wants to see me persevere.

98
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:50,368
I had never met a coach
who was that different

99
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:55,415
and genuine when it came
to bringing the group together.

100
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:59,419
He had this real interest
in Native American history,

101
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,006
and he would weave that
into our own culture.

102
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:08,469
He brought in Zen Buddhism
and Native American Indian philosophies.

103
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:12,140
Everything was about being focused,
playing as one.

104
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,724
When I was at Great Falls
as a kid growing up,

105
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,239
my grandparents had this boarding house
with small little cabins.

106
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:32,743
And Native American people
from a popular Indian reservation

107
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,871
used to come and they'd have their kids.

108
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:40,585
And so I started learning more and more
about this Native American culture.

109
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:44,839
There was a certain negativity
about playing with these kids.

110
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:46,841
I didn't feel that at all.

111
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:50,303
Cowboys and Indians was a game
that kids played.

112
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:51,971
And I was always the Indian.

113
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,434
My dad was a pastor.

114
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,103
My mother was also a minister.

115
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:04,108
She had an extreme belief
about the, uh, second coming of Christ.

116
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:09,697
So, that was something that was
foremost in your mind in growing up.

117
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:12,241
"Would you be ready, if Christ came,

118
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:16,454
to be taken as part of that group
that would be raptured?"

119
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,875
My goal was always in conflict.

120
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:24,253
I would rather be playing sports
than being on my knees, praying.

121
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,633
I played basketball from the time
I was a little kid,

122
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,595
and eventually went
to the University of North Dakota.

123
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,596
<i>Jackson is having
a whale of a night.</i>

124
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,016
<i>He scored 28 in the first half</i>

125
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:39,685
<i>and has continued the onslaught
here in the second half.</i>

126
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,856
The Knicks drafted me
in the second round.

127
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,610
And I'd made the All-Rookie Team,
my rookie season.

128
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,612
<i>Jackson defensively
gets the ball.</i>

129
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,489
I remember seeing Phil Jackson.

130
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,324
<i>Jackson knocking it away...</i>

131
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:55,243
He was always smacking guys around.

132
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,788
He was like an earlier version
of Dennis Rodman.

133
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,417
I was 11 years with the Knicks.

134
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:06,420
We had seven good years.
We went to the finals three years.

135
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,631
<i>White has the ball.
Stolen by Jackson!</i>

136
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,926
<i>Racing ahead of the field,
he drives, lays it up...</i>

137
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,844
And we won two championships.

138
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:25,439
Phil and I wrote
Maverick together.

139
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:29,402
In that book,
Phil talks about taking acid.

140
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:37,868
And thinking he was a lion,
roaring up and down the beach in LA.

141
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,829
Phil was like a hippie

142
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:44,375
and different from the NBA fraternity.

143
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:47,003
When I was playing as a pro,

144
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,839
Red Holzman encouraged me
to think about coaching,

145
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:53,426
and particularly in Puerto Rico,
where I ended up coaching for a while.

146
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:59,682
I spent a lot of time down there
in the Superior League, it was called.

147
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,309
They played every other day.

148
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:05,688
And these players
would just play ferociously.

149
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:20,911
<i>Jackson steps
on the court to argue with the referees.</i>

150
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:24,123
There was a local animosity
among these small towns.

151
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:30,087
There were fires on your way out of town,
and rocks being thrown at your car.

152
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:34,050
They'd kill a chicken... in a graveyard,

153
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:37,511
and pour the blood
on the visiting team's bench.

154
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:41,891
The town I went to,
Quebradillas, was ferocious.

155
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:45,853
The mayor had actually shot an official
one time with a gun

156
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:47,897
and hit him in the lower leg.

157
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,649
So, his punishment was

158
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:53,694
he wasn't allowed to go to any more
home games for the rest of the season.

159
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:57,615
But, really,
there's a lot of love about the game,

160
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:00,159
and I learned a lot of things
from the process.

161
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:06,499
And then I got a call about coaching
over in the CBA for the Albany Patroons.

162
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,753
<i>And now introducing
the head coach of the Patroons,</i>

163
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:14,090
<i>formerly of the New York Knickerbockers,
Phil Jackson.</i>

164
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,341
<i>Phil Jackson.</i>

165
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,886
<i>Then in '84,
we won the championship.</i>

166
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:20,388
They came together as a group,

167
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,640
and it's been a great team effort
ever since.

168
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:24,058
- We're ecstatic.
- Whoo!

169
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,812
After that,
the Bulls tracked me down,

170
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:33,317
and I got up to interview for
an assistant job under Stan Albeck.

171
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:37,279
Jerry Krause and I
had a really good relationship.

172
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,906
I wanted to bring Phil in.

173
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:42,785
He came in, uh... not dressed real well.

174
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,578
Stan was very conservative.

175
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:47,039
Phil looked anything
but conservative at that point.

176
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:51,836
And Stan quickly, uh, nixed that idea.
Two years later, we had an opening.

177
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,214
And this time I called Phil,
and I told him how to dress

178
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:59,677
and how to, uh, talk to Doug.
Doug Collins was our coach.

179
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:03,389
And I kind of helped Doug think about it,
and we hired Phil.

180
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,227
Under Doug Collins,

181
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,688
one of the assistant coaches
was Tex Winter.

182
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:14,692
Jerry Krause had the idea
that Tex was gonna be a mentor.

183
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:18,904
Doug was gonna follow the things
that he would teach as a coach.

184
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:22,742
When I took this job 11 years ago,
the first person we hired was Tex Winter.

185
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:27,621
<i>He's a brilliant man.
The finest offensive mind in basketball.</i>

186
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,332
Triangle is formed between...

187
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,921
Forward Two, Guard One,
who has now moved to the corner,

188
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,799
and Center Five,
who forms the apex of the triangle.

189
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:42,344
<i>He had a system
called "the triangle."</i>

190
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:46,015
<i>Jerry said, "I've been listening
to his basketball philosophy for years.</i>

191
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:49,935
He's got the kind of philosophy
I'd like to see happen with this team."

192
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:52,855
Doug's philosophy was different.

193
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:56,609
Doug would have these plays that always
ended up with Michael Jordan

194
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,736
being the recipient of the score.

195
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:00,738
Tex was always like,

196
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:03,657
"There's a way of playing this game
that's different than that."

197
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,620
Tex Winter... would berate Doug about,

198
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:11,248
"You should institute the triangle."
Doug would not hear of it.

199
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,292
Doug finally had heard it enough and said,

200
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:16,837
"I'm tired of hearing that,"
and then the argument escalated a bit,

201
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,548
and Tex Winter was banned from the bench.

202
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,928
He wasn't coaching on the floor anymore.

203
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:27,181
He was sitting in the corner,
taking notes about the practice.

204
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:30,100
Jerry Krause was really unhappy with that.

205
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:32,978
During that period of time,

206
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:36,148
Krause made the decision that I should
work together with Tex.

207
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:41,195
<i>Phil was picking the brains of
the best basketball man I've ever known,</i>

208
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:42,571
<i>and I was watching it.</i>

209
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:45,074
<i>And I thought, you know what?</i>

210
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,701
<i>This is getting more and more interesting
all the time.</i>

211
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,955
Is there anything that you missed?

212
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,415
You still got a bit more room.

213
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,585
I could've done
another tier here, Mike.

214
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,546
Mike, we want you to deny the ball,

215
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:01,131
so they can't throw the ball
in easy to the blocks.

216
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,133
So, big man, if your man clears,

217
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,094
you must tell Michael
that he's alone out there

218
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,346
so he doesn't get naked
on a back-door situation.

219
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,602
Midway through my second year,
I felt Phil could be the coach.

220
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:17,439
- What gave you that sense?
- Just sense.

221
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,778
- You don't want to go into the details?
- It's just feeling.

222
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:26,198
Jerry wanted to talk to me,
so I go in and talk.

223
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:30,452
He says, "I may have to do something
that's gonna rock this... franchise."

224
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,163
I said, "What?" He says,
"I'm gonna have to fire Doug Collins."

225
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,332
I said, "It's gonna be some fuckin' balls,

226
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,294
fire a guy that just took us
to the Eastern Conference Final."

227
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:42,381
If you're getting ready for work now,
you're probably not Doug Collins.

228
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:45,634
The Bulls head coach was fired
in a surprise move yesterday.

229
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:49,305
I have the worst-kept secret in town
sitting next to me.

230
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:52,850
You guys, as usual, got us on that one.

231
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,060
For the last two years,

232
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:58,230
Phil Jackson has been a very integral part
of this organization.

233
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:01,525
He's now ready to be a head coach.
Welcome, coach.

234
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:02,693
Thanks, Jerry.

235
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:05,864
Have you talked to
Michael Jordan yet?

236
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,948
- Yes, I have.
- What'd he say?

237
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,534
"Congratulations!
Let's go win a championship."

238
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:15,581
Phil took over and just
had a different approach.

239
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:20,669
Doug's approach was
more catered to Michael,

240
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:25,549
and Phil's approach was more catered
to the team.

241
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:29,261
I wasn't a Phil Jackson fan,
you know, when he first came in,

242
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:32,473
because he was coming in
to take the ball out of my hands.

243
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:34,266
Doug put the ball in my hands.

244
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,312
Tex Winter, his right-hand man,

245
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:41,649
had sold him on an offense
that he believed

246
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:46,737
would get us out of this
one-on-one type of basketball.

247
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,697
The triangle offense is set

248
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:52,201
so that there's a key pass
that creates motion.

249
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:57,665
Then there's 33 different types of options
that come out of that single pass.

250
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:05,047
Players can do spontaneous,
creative things using their strengths.

251
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,258
Everybody has an opportunity
to touch the ball

252
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:11,637
but I didn't want Bill Cartwright
to have the ball with five seconds left.

253
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,640
<i>...bounce into Cartwright,
shoots over Rollins. Nope.</i>

254
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:18,852
That's not equal-opportunity offense.
That's fucking bullshit.

255
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:23,440
<i>Oh, my!
Michael Jordan has 54 points!</i>

256
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:25,526
<i>Sixty points for Jordan!</i>

257
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:28,320
<i>Sixty-nine points for Michael Jordan.</i>

258
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:31,407
There was so many times
Tex used to yell at me, saying,

259
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,576
"Move the ball. Move the ball."
He says, "No 'I' in team."

260
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,328
I said, "There's an 'I' in win."

261
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:40,040
I met Michael and I told him
what we were gonna do.

262
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:45,212
"Obviously, you've scored 37,
38 points a game the last couple years.

263
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:48,841
I don't anticipate you're going to be
the scoring champion in the league.

264
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:53,429
The spotlight's on the ball and if you're
always the guy that's gonna have the ball,

265
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,682
teams can generate a defense against that,

266
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:59,560
which happened with the Pistons
the last couple years."

267
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,104
He said, "I'm not worried about you,

268
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,690
but we gotta find a way
to make everybody else better.

269
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,025
We gotta create other threats."

270
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,404
I came in the game as being a point guard,

271
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:15,909
but my growth sort of, uh,
grew me into a small forward.

272
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:21,123
The triangle offense allowed me
to be more of what I wanted to be.

273
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:24,251
<i>Scottie Pippen's turnaround!</i>

274
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:27,796
Scottie kinda developed that new position
called the point forward.

275
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,924
Instead of being in Michael's shadow,

276
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:34,053
Scottie was starting to blossom
as one of the top players in the NBA.

277
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,263
<i>Beautiful move by Scottie!</i>

278
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:40,142
<i>Making his All-Star debut
from the Chicago Bulls, Scottie Pippen.</i>

279
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:49,026
<i>Michael Jordan is making
an adjustment to this new philosophy,</i>

280
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:51,945
<i>which tries to relieve him
of the offensive burden.</i>

281
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:56,408
He realized that him playing
and just scoring 30 points

282
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:59,328
wasn't going to win
the last game of the season.

283
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,997
I'm not gonna be the type of person

284
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,833
who's very hungry to lead the league
in scoring once again,

285
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,960
or to chase individual accolades.

286
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:12,257
He made a conscious effort to say,
"No individual is gonna be the team."

287
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,676
Now, I'm more or less
geared towards team success.

288
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,929
That's a special thing to have happen,

289
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:20,516
when the largest icon
that the NBA's ever had understands that,

290
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,976
"I don't have to have the ball
in my hands all the time."

291
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:28,982
With the triangle offense, certainly,
it needed some little time to adjust,

292
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,401
for everyone to adjust to it
at their own pace,

293
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:36,406
and it took us about a year or so,
as a team, to do it.

294
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:43,413
But by the 1990 playoffs, we all felt that
we were ready to beat the Detroit Pistons.

295
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,791
The hurdle that comes up
now is the big one.

296
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:50,420
And we know that the challenge
of the Detroit Pistons is immense.

297
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:53,048
It's one that we've been
waiting for all season long.

298
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:57,010
Chicago was the only team to beat
the Pistons in the playoffs last year

299
00:18:57,094 --> 00:19:00,264
and they're a deeper
and more balanced team this time around.

300
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:03,725
I felt like we were
in a position to win, you know.

301
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,812
And we pushed them to a game seven
in their building.

302
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:09,982
That's the Scottie
migraine game, right?

303
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:11,524
Yeah.

304
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:17,322
<i>The defending
world champions, the Detroit Pistons,</i>

305
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,616
<i>extended to a seventh game.</i>

306
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:25,998
<i>And 21,500 are gathered here
for a very special afternoon.</i>

307
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,210
When I got up that morning
and went down for breakfast,

308
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,212
I had a headache.

309
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,424
I started feeling like
I wanted to throw up.

310
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:42,681
I went to the arena,
did my regular routine warming up,

311
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:46,351
and I was just, like, blind.
I couldn't see.

312
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,687
Game seven... Let's go!

313
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,481
- You know what time it is.
- Go 110%.

314
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:52,625
Know what time it is.

315
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:54,109
We got Scottie and BJ?

316
00:19:56,987 --> 00:20:00,115
- Yeah.
- You know we gotta go.

317
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,451
- This is it.
- Let's go.

318
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:03,660
All in.

319
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,078
- All out.
- No doubt.

320
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,748
We worked all season for this, guys.
Let's play hard.

321
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:09,124
Leave it all on the floor.

322
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:18,717
<i>Game seven from the Palace.</i>

323
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,472
<i>Piston ball.</i>

324
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,518
As the game started,
I couldn't focus.

325
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:32,689
Everything was blurry,
I was seeing double, black, and I just...

326
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,775
I couldn't get my eyesight.

327
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,819
<i>Pippen is one and five
in the field.</i>

328
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:39,446
<i>One and six.</i>

329
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,368
I told 'em, "I can't see,"

330
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:47,204
and I was taken out of the game.

331
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:52,709
He said he had a migraine. I don't...

332
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:55,128
I can't argue the point
that he had a migraine.

333
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:58,966
It was just one of those things that,
you know, it was so unfortunate.

334
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,175
When you can't see,

335
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,303
you're seeing double, and want to vomit,

336
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,847
and you gotta play
against Dennis Rodman?

337
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:19,611
<i>Pippen passes inside,
Laimbeer knocks it away.</i>

338
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:23,240
<i>4:10 to go. Here's Isiah.</i>

339
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:27,995
<i>The players on the Bulls
are playing from desperation.</i>

340
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,414
<i>Guys are trying to do more
than they're capable of doing,</i>

341
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:32,577
<i>and that includes Michael Jordan.</i>

342
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,047
<i>The lead is 20.</i>

343
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:43,051
<i>The Detroit Pistons will meet
the Portland Trail Blazers</i>

344
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:47,472
<i>in a best of seven,
beginning Tuesday night on CBS.</i>

345
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,524
<i>Michael Jordan had 31,
and he's with Pat O'Brien.</i>

346
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,486
Mike... Michael Jordan here,
in the midst of the celebration.

347
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,530
What are you saying to the other players?

348
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:07,826
All you can do is wish them good luck.
We fought hard. They were the better team.

349
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:09,494
We wanna be where they are.

350
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:12,289
We still gotta wait our turn,
and try to improve our team.

351
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,374
They were the better team
and played better today.

352
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:20,922
We were sitting
in the locker room after the game,

353
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:22,924
and nothing was said.

354
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,094
Everyone just sat there for a moment.

355
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:31,350
We had a chance to beat 'em.
We just didn't respond.

356
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:34,269
We got to that hill,
we almost looked over the hill.

357
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,857
I was devastated.
I was absolutely devastated.

358
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,736
I cried on the bus.
My father came on and said,

359
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:46,656
"Look, it's just one game.
Bounce back, come back next year."

360
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:53,747
I remember losing to the Pistons.

361
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:54,830
Damn Pistons.

362
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:56,458
Um...

363
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:59,628
That shit hurt.

364
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,992
You couldn't deny
that they were a great team.

365
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:05,300
We had to either change
something about ourself,

366
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:07,344
or we weren't gonna beat them.

367
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:08,929
Can't touch this!

368
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:12,265
- Congratulations!
- Thanks, Pat!

369
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:13,475
After that game,

370
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,353
instead of us all going on vacation,

371
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:18,438
we all showed up
and we started working out.

372
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:25,195
Everybody, starting with Michael, changed.

373
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:27,864
Before the Pistons,
Michael didn't weight train.

374
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:30,075
He didn't go in much
for strength training.

375
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:32,452
After the Pistons
beat the shit out of him,

376
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:35,288
he finally decided,
"I gotta put some muscle on."

377
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:38,542
I was getting
brutally beaten up.

378
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,795
And I want to administer pain.

379
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,756
I wanted to start fighting back.

380
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:47,342
It's difficult to add muscle

381
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,970
for an athlete that's
constantly burning calories,

382
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:51,721
running up and down all the time.

383
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:54,850
We started at 200.

384
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:57,436
We added five pounds

385
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:01,022
until he got to 215.

386
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:09,114
<i>When did you decide
to build it?</i>

387
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:13,160
I put it in just to get myself physically
strong enough to go against Detroit.

388
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:15,829
I was a slim and skinny kid.

389
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:18,498
But now, after I put on a couple pounds,

390
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,709
I can throw my weight around
a little more.

391
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,670
I would give him
a certain amount of reps to do.

392
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:25,505
He would never stop at that number.

393
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:28,300
If I asked for six,
I know he was gonna do 12.

394
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,846
He got to the point where he was like,

395
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:36,016
"Instead of them dishing it to me,

396
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:37,934
I'm gonna dish it back to them."

397
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:43,607
One of the criticisms has been
that Jordan is a great player,

398
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:46,318
but he can't lead his teammates
to a championship.

399
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:48,487
He can't make them better players.

400
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,947
You were known at that time

401
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,158
as the guy
who was a spectacular performer,

402
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:56,203
but not the winner
that Magic and Larry were.

403
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:57,996
Which ate at me.

404
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:00,040
It did. It did.

405
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:06,087
My energy started
to gear towards my teammates,

406
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,924
and pushing them to excel.

407
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,551
Michael forced the hand
of a lot of the players

408
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:15,639
to really dedicate themselves
to off-season training.

409
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:19,142
"Okay, we're gonna spend the summer
dedicated to this proposition,

410
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:22,896
that we're not gonna be runners-up.
We're gonna be champions."

411
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,148
Michael was on us.

412
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,275
No mistakes allowed.

413
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:30,862
Man, I see a screaming devil.

414
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,697
You make a mistake,

415
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:35,909
he's gonna scream at you,
he's gonna belittle you.

416
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:39,287
He demands almost perfection.

417
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:45,001
Man, when you see your leader
working extremely hard in practice,

418
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:50,549
you feel like, "Oh, man, if I don't
give it my all, I shouldn't be here."

419
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:54,386
He taught me how to stay in the gym.

420
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:59,558
And he spent a lot of time starting
to build the confidence that I needed.

421
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,935
Pippen became my focal point.

422
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:03,645
More than any other player,

423
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:06,189
Scottie benefited from
playing with Michael Jordan...

424
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:11,278
because Scottie had this
raw athletic ability.

425
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:13,280
<i>Two-hand dunk by Pippen!</i>

426
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:16,575
What he didn't have was
what Michael brought every day,

427
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:20,704
which was the drive to be the very best,
every single day.

428
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,415
The mental focus of the game.

429
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:27,669
Dumars, see I gotta help,
I gotta give him a bump...

430
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:31,256
So I'm gonna be a step slow.
I'll go to yours.

431
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:33,800
The thing about Pip is, you know,

432
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:36,553
you stand next to him,
you make him stronger.

433
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:41,808
All the Detroit times
when Rodman wanted to pick on him,

434
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:44,936
he needed someone there
to stand there and say,

435
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,605
"I'll fight with you, just fight."

436
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:53,028
Scottie and I bonded because he felt,
okay, he has someone that he can count on.

437
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:56,948
And I'm looking at, "Okay, I got someone
who I can actually count on."

438
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,409
And then Horace came right behind that.

439
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:02,954
During the time that the Pistons
reigned over us,

440
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:05,582
every time they'd do something to us,

441
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:08,710
we would complain to the referee
or try to go back at them.

442
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:12,005
Horace used to get beaten up.

443
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:15,133
<i>He got Grant
with an elbow in the side...</i>

444
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:18,678
And he would come back whining.
And I'd say, "Don't fucking whine.

445
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:22,015
Don't let 'em see you whine.
That's when they know they got you."

446
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:25,727
With them being more
mentally dominant than we were,

447
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:30,148
they knew, soon as we start complaining,
they had us. And they did.

448
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:33,443
<i>Grant has got
to realize this game is not over.</i>

449
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:36,529
<i>You can't give
the world champions anything.</i>

450
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:39,824
Just be strong.
We gonna beat these bullies.

451
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:41,743
In '91,

452
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:44,496
the Bulls were determined
to be the tougher team.

453
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:49,918
The pain of losing to Detroit,
again, the year before,

454
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:55,465
brought a fury into that season
that they had not had.

455
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:57,550
<i>Jordan knocks the ball
out of bounds.</i>

456
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,594
<i>No, he didn't! He saved it and played...</i>

457
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:02,514
<i>What a spectacular defensive play
by Jordan!</i>

458
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:03,932
<i>A pass stolen by Jordan...</i>

459
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:08,728
Being around Michael every day
like that, it just brought it out of us.

460
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:12,774
Scottie evolved, Horace evolved,
I evolved.

461
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:14,984
It was a great feeling.

462
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:18,822
We had matured in a lot of ways,
physically, mentally.

463
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:22,033
<i>Jordan dribbles out,
a hook pass to Pippen for the dunk.</i>

464
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:25,704
It was time for us to become
the top team in the game.

465
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:41,261
<i>And now, the starting lineup
for your Chicago Bulls...</i>

466
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:46,683
Everybody in Chicago
hated the Pistons.

467
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:48,393
This was personal.

468
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:51,354
Anybody says it wasn't personal,
it was personal.

469
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:55,734
<i>Game one
of the best of seven.</i>

470
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:59,362
I didn't wanna deal with
my relatives in Detroit during that time.

471
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:02,031
I didn't wanna go stay with them.
My first cousins,

472
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:05,785
"Yeah, whatever. We don't like you
right now." They didn't like us.

473
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:09,205
<i>The opening tip. Game one.</i>

474
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:12,542
Our character was challenged
the last two years and we failed.

475
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:14,294
But that third year,

476
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,589
we put them in our rearview mirror.

477
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:18,965
<i>Bill Laimbeer.</i>

478
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:20,925
<i>Jordan with the steal.</i>

479
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:22,844
<i>Jordan!</i>

480
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,527
<i>He'll go to the foul line.</i>

481
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:27,348
<i>Jordan is not gonna
back down from anyone right now.</i>

482
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:30,477
<i>He's the leader and understands
what to expect during the series.</i>

483
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,771
<i>He's gonna hold his ground,
make a statement.</i>

484
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:40,820
I thought we were
a good enough team

485
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:43,323
to at least make the series

486
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:45,325
a little bit more competitive.

487
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:46,284
And we didn't.

488
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:49,746
<i>Pippen against Vinnie
up the right side to the baseline.</i>

489
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:51,915
<i>Fills it up, and a foul!</i>

490
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:01,466
<i>All right, Ahmad,
game four of the best of seven.</i>

491
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:05,512
<i>Nice fake by Jordan... Goes to the scoop!</i>

492
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:09,265
<i>Pippen...</i>

493
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:12,727
<i>Oh! Beautiful move by...
Scottie Pippen off to a fast start.</i>

494
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,270
<i>He has ten points.</i>

495
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:18,079
You know something's coming.

496
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,443
This team is desperate.

497
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:23,571
They've done everything they can.
Now, they're really desperate.

498
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:27,242
<i>Armstrong and Craig Hodges
in the back court.</i>

499
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:30,078
<i>Cliff Levingston, Bill Cartwright
and Scottie Pippen up for...</i>

500
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:33,039
<i>A beautiful back court pass for Pippen!
And he is walloped.</i>

501
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:34,916
<i>And that will be a flagrant foul.</i>

502
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:38,378
<i>And it's getting
very, very tough out there.</i>

503
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:41,256
Dennis Rodman pushed Scottie,

504
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:45,885
and could have injured him
pretty severely.

505
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:50,014
It was clearly, um, a flagrant foul.

506
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:53,726
<i>That's a clear-cut
cheap shot, no question. Clear cut.</i>

507
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,937
<i>Scottie Pippen was racked up.</i>

508
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:01,317
When Pippen didn't respond
to that abuse...

509
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:04,028
there was nothing
they could do to beat us then.

510
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:12,370
Scottie was unshakable,
didn't even want a Band-Aid.

511
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:14,372
When we saw that, it was over.

512
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:17,166
You know, it was like, "Okay, it's a foul.

513
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:20,795
Um, let's go ahead and finish
kicking their ass and you know..."

514
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,714
And put 'em out of their misery.

515
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:25,174
<i>Jordan rebounds. He has Pippen.</i>

516
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:32,307
<i>The Chicago Bulls
about to put the Pistons away in four...</i>

517
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,768
<i>And Pippen able to feed it off to Jordan!</i>

518
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,479
<i>Chuck is now
clearing the bench.</i>

519
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:41,441
<i>Miller Genuine Draft
player of the game,</i>

520
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:43,818
<i>Scottie Pippen of the Chicago Bulls.</i>

521
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:48,865
We were tasting victory over
a team that just kicked your butt

522
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:50,909
for the last three or four years.

523
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:57,415
I mean, the gratification...
You truly cannot put it into words.

524
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,960
<i>It is all over.</i>

525
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:08,176
That was the only time
that I think I'd ever been swept, um...

526
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:12,430
in a series. I was normally the one
doing the sweeping.

527
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:18,978
Their time had arrived and ours was over.

528
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:24,317
As we're coming out of the game,
Laimbeer said, "You know...

529
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:26,694
we're not shaking their hands.

530
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:28,947
This is how we're leaving."

531
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:32,867
<i>The Pistons wasting no time
in getting outta here,</i>

532
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,827
<i>as they are headed off...</i>

533
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:37,413
We didn't shake hands.
We just walked off the court.

534
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,749
"Fuck you guys.
Thank you for kicking our ass."

535
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:43,336
<i>They left the bench
although there's seven seconds remaining.</i>

536
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:45,004
<i>The Pistons just left.</i>

537
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,465
I think
it was difficult for them

538
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:49,801
because they were two-time champions.

539
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:53,262
But, you know,
there certainly has to be some respect.

540
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:55,974
Straight up bitches.

541
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:58,685
That's what
they walked off like.

542
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:03,022
"Yeah, we just kicked your ass.
Go ahead and go."

543
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:06,234
Detroit had a similar thing with Boston

544
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:07,652
that we had with them.

545
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:10,822
They had to overcome Boston, and they did.
I still remember...

546
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:13,533
it was the first time that, uh...

547
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:14,909
Detroit beat them,

548
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,745
and I can see Kevin McHale
coming out to half court

549
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,664
and shaking hands, things like that.

550
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,332
No.

551
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,086
Adrian Dantley
was shooting a free throw

552
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:30,258
and the Boston Celtics
were walking off during the game.

553
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:33,177
And I grab McHale,

554
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:38,808
and then he stopped
as he was walking off the floor.

555
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:44,564
That's how they left the floor.
And to us, that was okay.

556
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,316
Knowing what we know now,

557
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:51,696
and the aftermath of what took place,

558
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,614
I think we would have stopped

559
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:56,159
and said, "Hey, congratulate..."
like they do now.

560
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:59,203
"Hey, congratulate... ""Love ya, man!"
"Hey, congratulations..."

561
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,789
We would have did it.
Of course, we would have done it.

562
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:07,712
But during that period of time,
that's just not how it was passed.

563
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:10,965
When you lost, you left the floor.
That was it.

564
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:15,553
This is Isiah,
talking about the walk-off.

565
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,347
Well, I know it's all bullshit.

566
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:22,143
Whatever he says now,
you know it wasn't his true actions then.

567
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,270
He's had time enough to think about it.

568
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:27,899
Or the reaction of the public
that's changed his perspective of it.

569
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,778
You can show me
anything you want.

570
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:34,405
There's no way you can convince me
he wasn't an asshole.

571
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,618
<i>Knowing what we know now,</i>

572
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:43,122
<i>and the aftermath of what took place...</i>

573
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:48,544
<i>But during that period of time,
that's just not how it was passed.</i>

574
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:50,463
<i>It just... Just wasn't.</i>

575
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:53,049
<i>You can go back
and look at any of those old games,</i>

576
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:55,718
<i>or whatever, when you lost,
you left the floor.</i>

577
00:34:56,969 --> 00:35:02,100
<i>All you gotta do is you go back
to us losing in game seven.</i>

578
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:04,310
<i>I shook everybody hand.</i>

579
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:06,604
Two years in a row.

580
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:09,232
<i>We shook their hands when they beat us.</i>

581
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:13,778
<i>There's a certain respect to the game
that we paid to them.</i>

582
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,907
That's sportsmanship,
no matter how much it hurts.

583
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,409
And believe me, it fucking hurt.

584
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:22,537
But they didn't have to shake our hands.

585
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,497
We knew we whooped their ass already.

586
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,874
We'd gotten past them
and that was the most...

587
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:30,503
To me, that was better than,
in some ways, winning a championship.

588
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:43,141

607
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:14,148
In sports,

608
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:17,318
the stage is set for the Air-Magic show
in the NBA Finals.

609
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:20,613
Starting Sunday, it'll be Michael Jordan
and the Chicago Bulls

610
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:23,157
against Magic Johnson and the LA Lakers.

611
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:28,162
When you're a competitor,
you want to play against the best.

612
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,705
I played against Larry,

613
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:31,874
and I've always wanted
to play against Michael.

614
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,795
Up until that point,
there was a stigma that...

615
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:39,715
"Michael Jordan only wins scoring titles,
never championships."

616
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:42,510
That was my chance

617
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:46,555
to get in the category
of Larry Bird and Magic Johnson.

618
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,892
I guess this is something that
I've been waiting for.

619
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:53,771
It's the team that's won it the most,
in the time I've been in the league...

620
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:56,983
Even though they may have that experience,
we have that hunger.

621
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,235
The NBA is a league of stars,

622
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:02,863
and none shine brighter
than Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan.

623
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:05,574
While much has been said
about their respective teams,

624
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:08,786
nothing has been more anticipated
than their individual match-up.

625
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:16,502
<i>We're set
for the start of game one.</i>

626
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:19,297
<i>The opening tip
controlled by the LA Lakers,</i>

627
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:23,634
<i>as Magic Johnson moves across,
against Michael Jordan.</i>

628
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:27,013
You know, we were nervous.
It's our first time,

629
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:28,431
and we didn't even play well.

630
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:30,641
<i>And now,
Magic got it out for Worthy...</i>

631
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,518
<i>What a play! Magic Johnson...</i>

632
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:34,895
Sam Perkins
hits a three at the end.

633
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:35,813
<i>He's got it!</i>

634
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:37,648
And the Bulls lose game one.

635
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:41,110
Everybody, including me, goes,
"Lakers are gonna win this thing."

636
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:44,739
They beat us on our home court,
but in our minds,

637
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,908
we had a chance to beat them,
and we didn't even play good.

638
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,785
We were looking forward to game two.

639
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:54,457
<i>We are set for game two
of the NBA Finals.</i>

640
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,001
So, game two, Jordan goes nuts.

641
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:58,336
<i>Over Scott.</i>

642
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:00,963
<i>Michael Jordan on fire.</i>

643
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:05,134
<i>He's got it. Twelve straight field goals
for Michael Jordan!</i>

644
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:08,596
<i>Look away, to Levingston... Jordan...</i>

645
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:14,226
<i>Oh! A spectacular move by Michael Jordan!</i>

646
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:18,105
<i>That's 13 consecutive field goals!</i>

647
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:27,257
<i>The change
of putting Pippen on Magic Johnson</i>

648
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:28,491
<i>rather than Michael Jordan...</i>

649
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:31,118
Johnson's the greatest
point guard I've ever seen,

650
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:34,121
and Scottie Pippen was picking
Magic Johnson up full court.

651
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:36,999
Nobody did that.

652
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:41,754
Scottie accepted that challenge
and I knew what Scottie was gonna do.

653
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:43,672
I see it in practice all the time.

654
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:46,384
He gets up in your face
and he harasses you and...

655
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,010
Pip never let him get started.

656
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:54,642
<i>The crowd reacts
to Scottie Pippen</i>

657
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:58,270
<i>who did a tremendous job
in defending against Magic...</i>

658
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:01,899
Once we did that in game two,
we never looked back.

659
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:04,568
<i>Jordan around Divac.</i>

660
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:11,575
<i>Chicago Bulls take a 2-1 lead
in the best of seven.</i>

661
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:14,495
<i>And Teagle now one for six,
and it leads to this!</i>

662
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:20,501
<i>The Chicago Bulls come away
with a resounding victory.</i>

663
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:24,296
<i>In command
virtually all the way.</i>

664
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:30,511
<i>And it's this simple,
the Lakers have to win three in a row.</i>

665
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:32,388
<i>Game five, moments away.</i>

666
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,890
Hello, I'm Bob Costas.

667
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:36,976
This is the Larry O'Brien Trophy.

668
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:39,478
All indications are that by evening's end,

669
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:41,689
it'll be in the possession
of the Chicago Bulls.

670
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:49,697
Game five was a great back-and-forth,
back-and-forth game.

671
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:52,241
<i>Magic fires for Smith...</i>

672
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:53,324
<i>Good recovery...</i>

673
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:54,367
<i>It counts!</i>

674
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:57,246
<i>Lakers with a one-point lead.</i>

675
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:59,415
<i>Jordan with a gorgeous move.</i>

676
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:00,958
<i>The Bulls lead it by three.</i>

677
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:02,251
<i>Magic...</i>

678
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:04,211
<i>Drops it off...</i>

679
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:09,341
<i>After three, the Bulls and the Lakers
are tied at 80.</i>

680
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:15,097
So, the fourth quarter,
it's a precarious lead.

681
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:19,477
So, during a timeout, Phil asks Michael,

682
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,729
"MJ, who's open?" And he goes, "Paxson."

683
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,397
He goes, "Then get him the ball."

684
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,982
You don't have to shoot that shot.

685
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:26,567
Run around to the point.

686
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,194
John's open right there.

687
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:29,820
You can still create.

688
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:30,821
All right?

689
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,740
He's hitting shots.

690
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:37,036
Phil said, you know, forcefully,
"Paxson is open, get him the ball."

691
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,954
And I started looking for Paxson.

692
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:43,501
Everybody in the world's expecting Jordan
to force something through a double team.

693
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,712
He doesn't do it. He draws and dishes.

694
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:49,298
<i>Paxson open again...</i>

695
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:53,469
He trusts his teammate to make the shot.

696
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:57,389
Once Pax hits that first shot,
"Oh, okay. Fine.

697
00:41:57,473 --> 00:42:00,142
Let me do this again.
Penetrate, find Pax."

698
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:02,645
And he kept hitting 'em, kept hitting 'em.

699
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:05,231
<i>Again! Eighteen for Paxson!</i>

700
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:08,609
That was exactly what Phil was trying
to get Michael to understand

701
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,694
and believe in over the couple years,
is that,

702
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:12,571
"These other guys can help you out."

703
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:16,033
<i>It is a two-point lead
for Chicago.</i>

704
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:17,243
<i>Paxson!</i>

705
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:20,162
<i>Yes! John Paxson again!</i>

706
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:26,585
<i>The Chicago Bulls have won
their first-ever NBA championship!</i>

707
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:55,614
You did it the right way.

708
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:56,991
You did it the right way.

709
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:03,330
I love you.

710
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,623
- Scottie...
- Yes!

711
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:14,883
<i>When you get to that finish line
and you know that you won...</i>

712
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:17,595
<i>all those emotions
that you wrapped up into,</i>

713
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:18,929
<i>you can just let go.</i>

714
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,347
I'm so happy.

715
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:24,643
Everybody knows...

716
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:28,981
Has the picture in their mind of
when we beat Cleveland on that last shot

717
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:31,692
and he's punching the air,
he's all excited.

718
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:35,571
That's who we knew,
the competitive Michael Jordan.

719
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:39,867
The win-at-all-costs Michael Jordan.

720
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:44,121
Sometimes we'd question
whether he was human,

721
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,081
whether he had feelings.

722
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:50,753
A guy that was totally focused
on one thing and one thing only.

723
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:53,756
The only emotion
we had ever seen out of him

724
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:55,299
was anger or frustration.

725
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:59,303
We were literally stunned
to see those emotions.

726
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,389
Seven-year struggle.

727
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:04,058
Seven-year struggle.

728
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:09,563
And when they beat us, well,

729
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:14,068
we met in between both locker rooms,
and he put his arms...

730
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:15,653
<i>and started crying.</i>

731
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:19,239
<i>He was so happy that he had won,
that he busted through.</i>

732
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:23,202
<i>That was a special moment
for him and myself.</i>

733
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:25,496
It's a beautiful feeling.

734
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:27,539
If you're gonna lose, you lose to them.

735
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:29,375
I'm going to lose to Michael.

736
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:31,919
And that... That's how...
how it should be.

737
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:36,173
At last, I fit somewhere in

738
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:39,009
the category of Larry Bird
and Magic Johnson.

739
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:11,709
Shit! C'mon, drop my money down.

740
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,645
You said I can't show nobody
what I give you.

741
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:16,213
No. We're here. Don't show it to anybody.
Let me show it.

742
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:18,756
Yeah.

743
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:21,009
Denver. Denver.

744
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:25,389
How 'bout them Broncos?

745
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:29,059
Hey! Hey! Cheesehead!

746
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:34,022
Security. Security.

747
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:38,110
This man never gets sleep.

748
00:45:38,193 --> 00:45:41,238
- Dennis Rodman... Junior.
- Come on.

749
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:43,031
Hey, hey, don't say it on camera.

750
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:45,909
He never gets his sleep. Single man.
Thinks he can hang out all night.

751
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:47,995
Hey, hey, don't put that on tape.

752
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:50,122
Don't put that on... Hey, M.

753
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:51,790
- If he committed to one girl...
- M...

754
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,125
- M, come on.
- It's a lie.

755
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:54,877
It's a lie, he's out every night.

756
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,962
Do not put this on tape right here.

757
00:45:57,045 --> 00:45:59,423
- Why not? Get some sleep, man!
- That's messed up.

758
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:00,841
I get a whole lot of sleep.

759
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:03,218
- You've got a hangover this morning.
- No, I... M.

760
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:05,512
My mom and dad are gonna watch this, M.

761
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,181
Mom and dad, he's an alcoholic.

762
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:08,098
Hey.

763
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:14,354
Hey, hey, Phil, he can't work
for the media and be on this plane.

764
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:17,649
Right here, see him?
The highest-paid media guy in the world.

765
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:20,402
Come on, Ahmad makes more than me.

766
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:24,656
No. He wishes, though.
He wishes he does. Believe me.

767
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:29,536
The FC finally won.

768
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:33,624
It's actually kind of like a sign
of times are changing.

769
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:35,584
Might be changing the NBA, too.

770
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,185
<i>While the Bulls
were on the road,</i>

771
00:46:43,258 --> 00:46:45,594
<i>their GM took his shot back home.</i>

772
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:49,306
<i>Jerry Krause again
made his plans for next season very clear.</i>

773
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:52,351
<i>Coach Jackson won't be back.
And with Michael Jordan on record</i>

774
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:54,728
<i>as saying he won't play
for anyone other than Jackson,</i>

775
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,563
<i>Krause told the </i>Chicago Tribune,

776
00:46:56,647 --> 00:47:00,734
<i>"If Michael chooses to leave
because there is another coach here,</i>

777
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:02,361
<i>then it's his choice, not ours.</i>

778
00:47:02,444 --> 00:47:03,946
<i>We would love to have Michael back.</i>

779
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:06,240
<i>But Michael is going to have to play
for someone else.</i>

780
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:08,075
<i>It isn't going to be Phil."</i>

781
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,744
If Phil's not back,
then certainly I'm not back.

782
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:14,039
So, I mean, you know, it doesn't leave me
with any other choices,

783
00:47:14,122 --> 00:47:15,582
but not to play next year.

784
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:19,086
There's no room at all for you coming back
under any other circumstances?

785
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:20,462
No. None. None at all.

786
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:27,147
The Bulls
were dominating the east.

787
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:28,697
The east didn't seem to be a question.

788
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:30,097
The question was out west

789
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:33,517
with the team that they had met
in the finals the year before, Utah.

790
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:38,438
Now, keep in mind,
this was probably a finals preview.

791
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:42,150
This is the litmus test.

792
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:46,196
<i>Good evening.
Welcome to the Delta Center.</i>

793
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,282
<i>The thing that's really surprising</i>

794
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:51,743
<i>is the timing of that story
by Jerry Krause.</i>

795
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:55,998
<i>Yeah, Dick, unfortunately,
it's very cold. It's sad.</i>

796
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:57,916
<i>And if you really think about this,</i>

797
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,086
<i>performance and loyalty,
by the coaches and players,</i>

798
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:03,463
<i>are being just thrown out the window.</i>

799
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:08,552
<i>And the Bulls
starting out solidly, lead 8-2.</i>

800
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:12,431
<i>Here's Rodman,
after Pippen got the loose ball,</i>

801
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:15,726
<i>and Jordan hits the open shot!
The Bulls are doing it all.</i>

802
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:17,060
<i>It has been all Bulls...</i>

803
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:20,647
<i>Great pass from Longley
to a cutting Scottie Pippen.</i>

804
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,610
<i>And it's a 47-24 lead.</i>

805
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:27,154
<i>The Chicago Bulls
are running the Jazz wild</i>

806
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:28,572
<i>on the Jazz home court.</i>

807
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:30,782
<i>Loose ball, Karl Malone...</i>

808
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:32,506
<i>Dennis... There it is.</i>

809
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:34,745
<i>Down goes Malone and Rodman.</i>

810
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:36,204
<i>A double foul will be called.</i>

811
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:39,917
<i>You can see that this could
ignite something here that we don't need.</i>

812
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,712
<i>The Jazz with a 7-0 run
of their own here.</i>

813
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:45,839
<i>It's an eight-point game,
believe it or not.</i>

814
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:47,799
<i>This is as close as the Jazz have come.</i>

815
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:50,344
<i>Malone over Pippen, he's got it.</i>

816
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:52,512
<i>He's got it, he's right.</i>

817
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,890
<i>- He's un...
- Yeah. Unstoppable.</i>

818
00:48:56,850 --> 00:49:00,062
<i>Yes! And the Jazz have come back big!</i>

819
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:04,691
<i>Standing ovation for the Jazz,
who had to fight way back in this game.</i>

820
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:09,863
<i>Utah Jazz ending up
sweeping the Chicago Bulls this year,</i>

821
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:11,782
<i>winning here in Salt Lake City.</i>

822
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:14,242
<i>But Jerry Krause,
the big question is,</i>

823
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:16,536
<i>"Why now, come out
with a statement like this,</i>

824
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,331
<i>at the All-Star break?"
It's something for after the season.</i>

825
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:22,501
<i>I think it's just
a bad case of judgment on his part.</i>

826
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:25,003
<i>This looks like
a reality check for everybody.</i>

827
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:26,922
<i>Is this the end of the Bulls
as we know them?</i>
