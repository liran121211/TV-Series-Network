1
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,379
<i>I could have been a bomb,</i>

2
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:22,397
<i>I could have been in jail,
I could have been dead.</i>

3
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,524
<i>But I worked my ass off to get here.</i>

4
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,368
<i>You hear a lot of negative things
about Dennis Rodman.</i>

5
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:37,746
<i>Well, people don't actually know
Dennis Rodman.</i>

6
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,707
<i>They just see what they see on the court
and read in the papers,</i>

7
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,792
<i>and they say, "God, he's a bad person."</i>

8
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:46,880
Does it hurt you
that the public perceives you

9
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:49,215
as this bombastic, crazy guy?

10
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:53,094
No, I just think that
I created this monster.

11
00:00:56,097 --> 00:01:00,018
<i>But, uh, nobody could say anything bad
about me as a teammate.</i>

12
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,104
<i>You got the great Michael Jordan,</i>

13
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:05,315
<i>the great Scottie Pippen,
the great Phil Jackson,</i>

14
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:10,278
<i>but if you take me away from this team,
do they still win a championship?</i>

15
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:13,114
<i>I don't think so.</i>

16
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,745
<i>I love Michael Jordan to death.
I love Scottie Pippen, all these guys,</i>

17
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:21,372
<i>but they really don't do the things
that I do.</i>

18
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:27,629
<i>I'm the only guy
who does all the dirty work,</i>

19
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:29,339
<i>taking abuse from other players.</i>

20
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:33,843
<i>I wanna go out there
and get my nose broke, I wanna get cut.</i>

21
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,722
<i>Something that's gonna really
just bring out the...</i>

22
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,642
<i>the hurt, the pain.</i>

23
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:42,644
<i>I wanna feel that.</i>

24
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,774
<i>A spectacular move!</i>

25
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:49,442
<i>The game's over!</i>

26
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,861
<i>Chicago Stadium is going wild!</i>

27
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:56,324
<i>First of all,
there's no backstabbing going on here.</i>

28
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:57,283
<i>It's time for me to move on.</i>

29
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,767
<i>This will be Phil's last year
as coach of the Bulls.</i>

30
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,934
<i>- Are the expectations too high?
- Where do we go from here?</i>

31
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,460
<i>The only question: how long can it last?</i>

32
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:27,272
<i>They still might be considered
world champs, but so far this season,</i>

33
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:30,608
<i>the Chicago Bulls have looked more like
that old circus act from the '80s</i>

34
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:33,111
<i>called "Michael and his Jordanaires."</i>

35
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:36,406
They need help.
They're reeling, looking average.

36
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:38,908
<i>As for MJ's supporting cast,</i>

37
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,286
<i>Rodman is having trouble
getting out of the gate.</i>

38
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:47,167
Michael, are you tired
of talking about Pippen and all that yet?

39
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,334
Pretty much.

40
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,713
Until something happens,
until he says what he's gonna do,

41
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:53,840
we have to continue on.
We gotta do our jobs.

42
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:58,469
Let's go, fellas.

43
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:03,805
<i>First meeting with Michael
the player against Larry the coach.</i>

44
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,643
<i>Bulls and Pacers.</i>

45
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,897
<i>Dennis Rodman, blocked by Dale Davis.</i>

46
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,106
<i>Reggie Miller.</i>

47
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:13,401
<i>Look at the crossover,
right past Jordan for the hoop.</i>

48
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:16,029
<i>Phil Jackson, we've seen that look
before this year.</i>

49
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:18,823
<i>Pacers go on to the win,
dropping the Bulls to 8-7.</i>

50
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:22,035
<i>Last season, Chicago didn't lose
their seventh until game 56.</i>

51
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:23,953
We missed a lot of easy shots.

52
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,717
We haven't shot the ball
particularly well.

53
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:28,917
But, uh, tonight what killed us
was our rebounding.

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,501
Our rebounding was horrendous.

55
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:33,366
We couldn't get the rebound,
we couldn't clear the boards.

56
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,928
Dennis is kind of lagging
back there behind everybody else

57
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:43,097
in, you know,
his enthusiasm for the game right now.

58
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,434
Dennis Rodman's the best on-ball defender

59
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:49,479
I've ever seen in 30 years.

60
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:55,944
<i>The problem was that
he wasn't always motivated to play.</i>

61
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:58,446
It's another one of those periods
that I'm bored as hell.

62
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:02,242
I gotta find some way
to put a log on the fire.

63
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:07,247
...that's a low blow down here, right?
Intentional foul.

64
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,581
I didn't see it that way.

65
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,251
There's a lot of things I don't see.

66
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,757
Most of the time, though,
I see the shit you do.

67
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,850
Dennis hadn't accepted
the role that...

68
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:28,101
Scottie wasn't gonna be around
and we needed you to be more accountable.

69
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,727
I need to count on you.

70
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:35,358
So, around that time, we had a game,
and he gets kicked out for some shit.

71
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:39,654
And I'm livid,
because he got kicked out of the game

72
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:42,657
and leaves me out there by myself
'cause Scottie's not playing.

73
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,994
And Dennis knew he fucked up.
He knew he screwed up.

74
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,456
I hear someone knocking on my door
at the hotel.

75
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,334
Now, Dennis never comes in my room,

76
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:56,045
and he comes and says,
"Man, you got an extra cigar?"

77
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:59,340
I went to Michael Jordan's room,
asked for a cigar, but...

78
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:02,844
But I think that he knew the fact that...

79
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:04,887
That's probably his way...

80
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:08,683
Of me showing him that, you know,
"Man, my thing, my bad."

81
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,853
He didn't say an apology,
he didn't say anything,

82
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:13,813
but by him coming to my room,

83
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:16,024
it was his way of saying,
"Look, I fucked up."

84
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:20,236
<i>And from that point on,
Dennis was straight as an arrow.</i>

85
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,238
<i>And we started to win.</i>

86
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,032
I'd like to ask y'all one question.

87
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,451
- What time is it?
- Game time!

88
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:40,298
When Scottie left, I think
Mike had a lot of confidence in me

89
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:42,467
to know that I'm gonna be there for him.

90
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,178
I'm not going to let him down,
I'm not going to let the team down,

91
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:46,846
let the city down. No.

92
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:51,768
<i>Rodman clears
the defensive board for the Bulls.</i>

93
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:58,107
<i>Nets gave it a whirl,
but just did not have enough.</i>

94
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:03,905
<i>The defending champion Chicago Bulls
knocked off the New Jersey Nets 100 to 92.</i>

95
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:06,699
Dennis is what held us together
when Scottie was out.

96
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:10,995
He had to really focus to make us
as competitive as we were.

97
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:15,666
We adapt and we adapt quickly,
and we're off and running.

98
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,920
<i>Rodman,
battling for the rebound, saving it in!</i>

99
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:21,047
<i>And Kerr snatches it out of the air,</i>

100
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:22,589
<i>and drills it!</i>

101
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,176
<i>Now that's...
that's winning basketball.</i>

102
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:30,056
<i>Those are the plays that Dennis Rodman
does to make his team great.</i>

103
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:31,682
<i>Awesome.</i>

104
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,073
As a black kid
living in the projects,

105
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:49,992
life was really fucking nuts,
right, it was like... Whoa!

106
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,747
My mother drove buses for the school.

107
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:58,835
She got sick and tired of my ass
not providing, not doing anything.

108
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:02,046
And, I think... What was I, 18?

109
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,382
She just got tired of me
and kicked me out

110
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:06,384
so I lived in the street for two years.

111
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:10,972
I was just trying to bounce around,
see where I could stay at.

112
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,851
People's backyards, my friends' backyards,
stuff like that.

113
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,978
I could've been a drug dealer,
I could've been dead,

114
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:19,188
I could've been...
Shit, anything at that time.

115
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:23,317
I don't know why I never did
that drug stuff, but I never did.

116
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,280
I'd just sit there and watch 'em do it,
watch 'em sell it, stuff like that,

117
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:29,782
and I walk out the door every day,
go to the gym.

118
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:32,160
Come back, do the same thing every day.

119
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:35,663
I was just fortunate to start picking up
a basketball and start playing.

120
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:39,542
And I just got lucky that

121
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,336
some guy from some college said,
"Dennis, you wanna play for us?"

122
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,796
I was like, "All right, great."

123
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:49,677
I went balls-out every time. I don't know.
I just know how to go full speed.

124
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,391
So, when I was in college, I averaged,
like, 27 points, 14, 15, rebounds a game.

125
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:05,568
I'm trying to get through school,
try to get a degree and things,

126
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:11,240
and whatever's... When I finish school,
I just hope for the best.

127
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,452
We had two other picks in the second round
that I'll give you quickly.

128
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:16,913
Greg Dreiling went to Indiana,
the big center,

129
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:20,500
and Dennis Rodman, the youngster
from Southeast Oklahoma State,

130
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:24,045
went to Detroit
as the 27th pick in the 1986 draft.

131
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:30,426
When he first came to Detroit,
he was just an innocent, beautiful person,

132
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,888
but a little naive about, like, the world.

133
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:37,016
He was simple at that time.

134
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,727
He would say, "Man, you don't know life

135
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,688
till you can just go out,
get away from everybody,

136
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:47,443
make a fire, cook food outside,
and just look at the stars."

137
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,729
I think the second
or third year in the league,

138
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:55,868
I actually figured out what I can do best:
rebound and play defense.

139
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,995
<i>Barkley, with the drive...</i>

140
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,748
I just started
learning how to perfect that.

141
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:02,959
<i>Holy cow! How about that?</i>

142
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,044
I used to have my friends late at night,

143
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:08,881
shit, 3:00, 4:00 in the morning,
go to the gym. I said, "Shoot the ball."

144
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,509
I said, "Shoot over here,
shoot over there..."

145
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:13,886
I'd just sit there, react, react.

146
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:18,391
I practiced a lot about the angle
of the ball and trajectory of it.

147
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:22,395
You got a Larry Bird, it's gonna spin.
You got a Magic, it maybe spin.

148
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:25,314
When Michael shoot over here,
I position myself right there.

149
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,984
Now if it hit the rim, it's... Boom.

150
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,444
Click and go back this way.
It going here and here.

151
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,696
Click, it going that way.

152
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:32,822
Boom! That way.

153
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,657
Click here and go this way.

154
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,119
So, basically, I started learning how to
put myself in a position to get the ball.

155
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:40,663
<i>Rebound,
kept alive by Rodman, and...</i>

156
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:44,750
I was pretty much like that rash
on players,

157
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,003
that rash you can't
never get rid of, right?

158
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:55,177
Dennis Rodman was the fuck-up person.
He just fucks everything up.

159
00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:00,057
He's a pest.
Shutting down whoever he wanted to.

160
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,059
It was always a challenge.

161
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:07,023
He was one of them players that had
changed the game just by his presence.

162
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:11,694
You talk about coach's dreams,
there aren't many players like him.

163
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:15,573
Couldn't be a player I'm more proud of
and proud to be associated with.

164
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:18,159
He had a great relationship
with Chuck Daly.

165
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:21,078
<i>Chuck was the only person
that understood him.</i>

166
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,455
Let's say your guy stops side,

167
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:25,082
you're in here,
you're defense, lock him here.

168
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,918
I remember one time,
I was working with Dennis,

169
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:31,714
and then Chuck called me over,
and he said, "Just leave him alone.

170
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,800
You don't put a saddle on a mustang."

171
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:41,932
Were you considered
a troublemaker on the court in college?

172
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,977
- Did you have that reputation?
- No. I built that in Detroit.

173
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,646
There's no disputing that Detroit

174
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,398
is one of the most physical teams
in the NBA,

175
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,359
and it's all part of their strategy

176
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,778
to take their opponents
out of their rhythm.

177
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:57,740
The Detroit Pistons
were the epitome

178
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:04,205
of the physical, tough,
hard-nosed brand of half-court basketball.

179
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:11,253
They had big strong guys in Laimbeer,
Mahorn, Rodman, Salley.

180
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:15,841
They had a great defensive player
in Joe Dumars, they had Isiah Thomas.

181
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:19,637
Were they threatening
the safety of the league's top players?

182
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,848
I don't think they cared.

183
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,437
<i>Wilkins gets knocked
to the deck, and wants Mahorn.</i>

184
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,232
<i>Rivers...</i>

185
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:34,276
<i>Pushed hard. I mean,
he was driven to the floor.</i>

186
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:38,364
At that time, in the NBA,
you could do anything you want.

187
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:42,451
Compared to today,
30 years ago, shit.

188
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:46,330
Back then, you could just sit there
and just literally beat people up

189
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:49,667
and get away with it
without a technical or anything.

190
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:54,296
<i>Dennis Rodman and Lohaus,
under the basket, going at it.</i>

191
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:58,634
We're like a hockey team,
everybody wanna see us fight.

192
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,303
Rick Mahorn taught me
how to elbow and said,

193
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,305
"If you hit somebody, do it on purpose.

194
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:07,351
Don't get a cheap foul. That's stupid.
If you're gonna hit him, hit him."

195
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:10,438
They acquired the moniker "The Bad Boys."

196
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:16,277
They played a tough, intimidating style,
and a lot of people didn't like it

197
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,196
'cause it was getting away
from the beauty of basketball.

198
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,824
<i>Bird and Laimbeer go at it.</i>

199
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:25,244
We weren't "the league's favorite."
We weren't the...

200
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:29,915
We weren't the pretty team that had got
invited to the Lakers' and Celtics' party.

201
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:34,170
When we showed up, it was almost like
we were crashing their party.

202
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:37,214
This is the way the game of basketball
was played at the time.

203
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:40,301
These guys on the other side
may not be as talented,

204
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:42,136
but when you do come into Detroit,

205
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,513
you gonna get your ass whooped.

206
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,975
<i>We got a fight.
Laimbeer and Daugherty going after it.</i>

207
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,228
We just basically...
"Okay, we're the bad boys."

208
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:54,315
We started feeding into it.
Next thing you know, we starting to win.

209
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,614
The Pistons
had overtaken the Celtics

210
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,908
as kings of the Eastern Conference,

211
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:08,370
and they're rolling along just as
the Bulls are really starting to emerge.

212
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:13,709
In '86-'87, when Jerry Krause
made a head coaching hire,

213
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,463
I think we all felt that
we needed something different.

214
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,007
This speaks to Jerry's strengths.

215
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:23,093
He identified a young Doug Collins,

216
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:28,390
who he felt would bring an energy
and enthusiasm that a young team needed.

217
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,018
This is a game
that we need to have high energy.

218
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:34,355
We have a high energy level.
We win tonight, we got tomorrow off,

219
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:37,209
so you can spend all night in LA
doing whatever you want. I don't care.

220
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:40,194
Otherwise, we got practice tomorrow...

221
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:42,822
<i>Dougie was a breath of fresh air.</i>

222
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,658
He believed in everything that
I believed in. He wanted to win.

223
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:48,077
He was an easy guy, great guy to play for.

224
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:53,123
Welcome, sports fans,
this is the Chicago sports... casino.

225
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:55,292
- He cheats.
- Man! Take that!

226
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:58,212
- Wins again.
- Bet, bet, bet.

227
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:01,674
- We know why he win, he got kings.
- Kings, that's right.

228
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:05,761
Doug's energy on the sideline
was unparalleled.

229
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:10,266
He'd walk off the floor of a game,
and he would be drenched in sweat.

230
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,852
I mean, he just...
He looked like he played.

231
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:16,188
Let's make sure, above all,
we get some rest.

232
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:19,149
Detroit, we're one and four
against those.

233
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:23,988
And it's on national TV, and I want to
beat those guys on Sunday. Let's go.

234
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,656
Yeah!

235
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,242
The year before I came,

236
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:31,996
the Bulls had been eliminated
by Boston in the playoffs.

237
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,956
<i>The ball game's over.</i>

238
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,250
<i>The series goes to Boston
in three straight.</i>

239
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,336
<i>The final score, 122-104, Celtics.</i>

240
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,630
The roster
was a little thin at that time.

241
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:45,217
I'd seen Michael play, but I really never
had spent any time around him.

242
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,428
<i>Number 34, Charles Oakley.</i>

243
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:50,031
Our second-best player
at the time was Charles Oakley.

244
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,725
He was a vicious rebounder,
brought a lot of toughness.

245
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:55,603
John Paxson was on that team,
Dave Corzine.

246
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,814
<i>And their head coach,
Doug Collins.</i>

247
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:02,735
The first game I coached,
we went to Madison Square Garden.

248
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:06,196
And the Knicks had Patrick Ewing,
Bill Cartwright, they were loaded.

249
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,615
Hubie Brown, Hall of Fame coach.

250
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,951
Two minutes to go in the game.
The game was tied.

251
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,411
I'm soaking wet with sweat.

252
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:15,289
I've chewed my gum to a powder,
it's around my mouth.

253
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:18,918
And I saw this hand come out
with a cup of water,

254
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,629
and it was Michael Jordan.
He looked at me and said,

255
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:24,840
"Coach, take a drink of that water,
clean that stuff off your mouth.

256
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,675
I'm not gonna let you lose
your first game."

257
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,741
<i>Here's Jordan again.</i>

258
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,221
<i>All alone...</i>

259
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,766
<i>Turns, off the glass.</i>

260
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:36,018
<i>Forty-two points for Michael Jordan.</i>

261
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:40,105
<i>Ten seconds on the shot clock,
Rory Sparrow working on it.</i>

262
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,358
<i>Jordan, to the basket, scores.</i>

263
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:45,986
He went out and scored the last ten points
of the game, ended up with 50.

264
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:50,532
<i>Michael Jordan setting
a new Madison Square Garden record</i>

265
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,285
<i>for an opposing player tonight,
scoring 50 points.</i>

266
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:56,789
<i>The Chicago Bulls make
Doug Collins a winner his first time out,</i>

267
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:59,291
<i>and it is a happy Doug Collins
on the far side.</i>

268
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,835
I remember being on the plane,
going back to Chicago, I said,

269
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,631
"Wow. This guy is something
like I've never seen before."

270
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:08,008
Doug and I, we're like this, you know.

271
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,052
<i>He designed the offense</i>

272
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:14,181
<i>to support the way I play the game
and the way he wanted to coach.</i>

273
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:17,101
It's all right, Michael. It's all right.

274
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:19,019
<i>I think he loved my competitiveness.</i>

275
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:23,232
He understands that the greatest respect
you can give a great player

276
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,275
is to coach him and coach him hard.

277
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:31,156
<i>Michael's big thing was,</i>

278
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,367
"Stack the practice against me
and I'll still win."

279
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:38,038
Doug always tried to maintain
a competitive advantage in practice.

280
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,712
I'd be with the starting five.

281
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,256
Then next thing you know,

282
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,925
while I was winning,
he'd put me with the second team.

283
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,929
One day at practice, he got upset.
He thought I was cheating on the score.

284
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:59,601
And, uh, he got upset and left practice,
and, uh, we came back the next day,

285
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,604
they were asking, "You talked
to Michael since practice yesterday?"

286
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:06,025
I said, "I haven't had a chance. We will."
Then Michael came out.

287
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,193
I reached over, grabbed him,
kissed him on the cheek.

288
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,862
I said, "I love him. He loves me."

289
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:12,698
- Would you come here so we can kiss on TV?
- Here we go.

290
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:16,535
- Would you tell them everything is fine?
- Aww.

291
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,680
We've kissed and made up now.

292
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:24,543
I coached him for three years,
from the '86-'87 season through '88-'89.

293
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:29,089
When I was coaching him,
he was the MVP of the league.

294
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,133
<i>...in deep, scoops it in!</i>

295
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:34,011
He was the MVP
of the All-Star Game.

296
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:39,600
He won the slam dunk competition...

297
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,978
and he was
the Defensive Player of the Year.

298
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,622
<i>...pass stolen by Jordan.</i>

299
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:47,941
<i>Michael Jordan takes it
coast-to-coast. Whoo!</i>

300
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,110
That's greatness.

301
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,821
You know, I mean,
he was now the best player.

316

Under Doug Collins,
the Bulls were rapidly improving,

317
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:45,434
and suddenly becoming a real contender
in the Eastern Conference.

318
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:50,772
Detroit was certainly, at the time,
the team to beat in the east,

319
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,691
but who was going to be their challenger?

320
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:55,736
Who was going to really rise up
and challenge Detroit?

321
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,696
It was gonna be one of two teams.

322
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:00,115
The Bulls were in ascension,
obviously, at that time,

323
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,660
with their young core of Jordan
and Pippen and Horace Grant.

324
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:07,789
But Cleveland was,
at the time, a great team.

325
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,751
So these are the two rising teams
in the east.

326
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:16,048
The Bulls play
Cleveland in '89 in a best-three-of-five.

327
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,967
Most basketball observers believed

328
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,594
Cleveland was better.

329
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:22,304
Nobody has picked the Bulls.

330
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:25,682
The media picked Cavs.
Everybody's picked, nationally, the Cavs.

331
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:30,020
Back then, we played teams
six times in our division.

332
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:33,982
They beat us six times, 6-0.

333
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,860
So now in our mind,
we got nothing to lose.

334
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:41,823
Bulls win the first game,
Cleveland wins the second in Cleveland.

335
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,787
<i>Tied 1-1
with Cleveland's victory.</i>

336
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:45,994
Back to Chicago,
Bulls win game three.

337
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,372
<i>Chicago wins it, 101-94.</i>

338
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:53,001
Game four, Jordan's got a free throw
at the end of regulation, misses.

339
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:57,923
<i>Missed it. The Cavaliers
have kept their hopes alive.</i>

340
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,883
We go back to Cleveland for game five.

341
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:03,804
<i>And welcome
to the Richfield Coliseum for game five</i>

342
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:06,640
<i>between the Chicago Bulls
and the Cleveland Cavaliers.</i>

343
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,810
Up to that time, the franchise,

344
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:12,104
the history of the Bulls
was blowing leads.

345
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:14,856
And you're like, "Oh, my God,
this is gonna happen again.

346
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,235
They're gonna blow this. They're gonna
lose the series to Cleveland."

347
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:21,822
So, game's about to start,
and there was two other beat writers.

348
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:25,033
Beat writer from the Sun-Times, Lacy Banks

349
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,452
and Kent McDill from the Herald and me.

350
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,872
And Lacy's picked
the Cavs to sweep in three.

351
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:34,710
Kent's picked the Cavs to win in four,
and I've picked the Cavs to win in five.

352
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,504
So, Michael... Game's just about to start,

353
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:41,258
Michael walks over to Lacy, and points
to him and says, "We took care of you."

354
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:43,844
He looks at Kent and says,
"We took care of you."

355
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:46,513
And he looks at me,
"And we take care of you today."

356
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:50,892
<i>Mark Price and Ron Harper
in the backcourt</i>

357
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,020
<i>and we're underway. Cleveland has it.</i>

358
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:56,481
We went back and forth
the whole time.

359
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:59,359
<i>Jordan against Harper,
great turnaround.</i>

360
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:00,986
It was a very tough game.

361
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:02,654
<i>This is the playoffs,</i>

362
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:06,199
<i>and here we have two great teams
right here, guys that lay it out.</i>

363
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,326
It was a constant battle.

364
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:23,604
<i>We have had drama
in the final minutes of the game.</i>

365
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:26,136
<i>- Eleven seconds to go.
- In the middle...</i>

366
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:27,471
<i>Jordan has it,</i>

367
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:31,266
<i>and Jordan puts up a jumper and hits,
with six seconds to go.</i>

368
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:35,354
<i>Jordan hits the basket and now
has 42 points in the game,</i>

369
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:38,065
<i>and the Cavaliers have called a timeout.</i>

370
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:41,902
<i>Ehlo will inbound. He gets it in to Nance,
gets the ball back,</i>

371
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:45,072
<i>drives to the hoop, lays it in
with three seconds to go.</i>

372
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:53,246
<i>Here's our story,
here at Richfield Coliseum.</i>

373
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:57,626
<i>One of these teams will advance.
It has been a thrilling game.</i>

374
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:02,547
<i>The Bulls have three seconds to try a shot
and try to win the game.</i>

375
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:05,384
Everybody knew
where the ball was gonna go.

376
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:10,430
They had Craig Ehlo on me
at the time which,

377
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,766
honestly, was a mistake,

378
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:16,436
because the guy that played me better
was Ron Harper.

379
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,772
We up by one.

380
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:21,400
I said, "Coach, I got MJ.

381
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:23,944
I got MJ."

382
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:28,698
So the coach tells me,
"I'm gonna put Ehlo on MJ."

383
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:30,409
And I'm, like...

384
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:34,621
"Yeah, okay, whatever,
fuck this bullshit."

385
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:39,709
Defense! Defense!

386
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:43,922
We drew a play
where I was coming to the ball.

387
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:48,135
But I only had time to get
one dribble and get a jump shot off.

388
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,346
We were gonna live and die
with that scenario.

389
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,558
So I was doing everything
I can to get the ball.

390
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:57,436
<i>The inbounds pass
comes in to Jordan.</i>

391
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:59,896
<i>Here's Michael at the foul line,
a shot on Ehlo...</i>

392
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:03,066
<i>Good! The Bulls win, they win it!</i>

393
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:13,160
<i>And Chicago
has knocked off the Cavs, 101-100.</i>

394
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,620
Michael!
Michael, you stuck it, baby!

395
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:17,873
Michael, you stuck it, baby.

396
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,374
- You stuck it!
- Yeah!

397
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,837
I feel very vindicated from
when we started the playoff

398
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,131
with the dim look
that everybody was giving us...

399
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:28,758
Even I asked you in the locker room,
I asked everybody,

400
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:32,345
"What was the feeling back in Chicago?
Did they write us off yet?"

401
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:34,181
You said, "Some of 'em
have written us off."

402
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,849
I said, "Tell those guys to stay home."

403
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:39,153
Somebody had written or said,
"The Bulls were gonna go home,

404
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:40,896
send them home."

405
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:44,065
So when he hits the shot,
"Go home, motherfuckers, go home."

406
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:48,195
Get the fuck out of here, go fucking
anywhere, but you out of here.

407
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:50,906
Whoever is not with us,
all you fuckers, go to hell.

408
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:54,284
<i>Jordan beat them
at the buzzer with a jump shot.</i>

409
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:56,828
It was so dramatic and it was typical

410
00:24:56,912 --> 00:25:00,248
of what we'd see Michael do
the rest of his career in big moments.

411
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:05,003
That shot enabled the Bulls
to start growing

412
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:07,714
and believing
that something special was on the horizon.

413
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:10,926
We finally got over
the hump of losers' mentality.

414
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:13,470
We were starting to become
a winning franchise,

415
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:16,473
and, you know, the sky was the limit.

416
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:22,437
<i>How high can this man fly?
Michael Jordan is soaring</i>

417
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,814
<i>and the Chicago Bulls
are going right with him.</i>

418
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,235
<i>But now Superman faces his toughest test.</i>

419
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:33,198
<i>And we bring you the first game
of the Eastern Conference Championship</i>

420
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:38,495
<i>between the underdog Chicago Bulls
and the favored Detroit Pistons.</i>

421
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:43,124
The NBA was invested
in making Michael Jordan its star.

422
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,126
The Pistons were...

423
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:47,837
slowing that down.

424
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:53,718
We knew how important to the NBA it was
to get Michael to go to the next level.

425
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:59,015
The blueprint was Larry,
Magic, now Michael.

426
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,228
And all of a sudden,
there was this little team in Detroit

427
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:05,480
who just messed up the whole story.

428
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,065
We loved that.

429
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:09,067
How legitimate
was the hatred

430
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,278
between those Bulls teams
and those Pistons?

431
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:12,362
Oh, I hated 'em.

432
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:15,490
Yeah, the hate carries even to this day.

433
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,704
They made it personal.
They physically beat the shit out of us.

434
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:22,998
When we played the Pistons
in that series,

435
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:26,751
it was...
it was arm-to-arm physical combat.

436
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:30,964
But we never backed down. We fought them.

437
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,509
<i>The Bulls have won
the first game.</i>

438
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,219
So we got game one.

439
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:37,554
They won game two.

440
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,973
We came back to Chicago,

441
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:42,475
Michael had
one of the most incredible games.

442
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:46,521
<i>Jordan. Steal,
he kept it in bounds, here it is again.</i>

443
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:49,816
<i>Oh! Yes!</i>

444
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:55,530
<i>You'll see him elevate,
do a 360 and just toss it up.</i>

445
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,574
<i>Pippen, finds Jordan.</i>

446
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,367
<i>Rodman is on him, one-on-one.</i>

447
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:01,578
<i>Five seconds to go.</i>

448
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:03,788
<i>Jordan, off the glass. Yes!</i>

449
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,626
<i>It's over. Chicago wins.</i>

450
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,759
What was your call
on that last play?

451
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:17,510
That was, "Get the ball to Michael,
everybody get the fuck out of the way..."

452
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:19,754
"...and go to the basket."

453
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,267
Jordan pretty much took over the game,

454
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:26,770
made all the big field goals
down the stretch,

455
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:29,564
showed like the...
Showed the superstar he really is.

456
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,400
Chuck, how do you bounce back?

457
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:36,905
We knew Michael Jordan's
the greatest player,

458
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:41,534
and we tried to use it as a rallying cry
to come together.

459
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:47,082
We had to do everything from
a physicality standpoint to stop him.

460
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:51,336
Detroit had "Jordan Rules"
just for Michael.

461
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:53,755
I don't know how he came out of it alive.

462
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:56,424
<i>The infamous "Jordan Rules,"</i>

463
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:59,761
<i>the Pistons' defensive tactics
designed to contain their namesake,</i>

464
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:02,389
<i>are enforced whenever
Michael is on the floor.</i>

465
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:04,683
When he was in the air, we had no shot.

466
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:09,062
Uh, but when everything was on the floor,
you can hold your own.

467
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:11,272
You have to stop him
before he takes flight

468
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,233
'cause, you know, he's not human.

469
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,422
<i>Michael Jordan. Fouled.</i>

470
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:19,239
<i>Jordan. Jordan again, pushed.</i>

471
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:22,409
<i>Here again,
the implementation of the "Jordan Rules."</i>

472
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:27,080
<i>The Pistons will even it up
at two apiece,</i>

473
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:30,208
<i>and the story of this game,
the Detroit defense.</i>

474
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:33,044
This is what
the "Jordan Rules" were:

475
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:37,215
on the wings, we're going to push him
to the elbow,

476
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,260
and we're not gonna let him
drive to the baseline.

477
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:45,974
Number two: when he's on top,
we're going to influence him to his left.

478
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:51,062
When he got the ball in the low post,
we were going to trap him from the top.

479
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:53,648
That's the "Jordan Rules,"
and it was that simple.

480
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,680
What happens
when he does make the baseline?

481
00:28:57,527 --> 00:29:00,905
That's when Laimbeer and Mahorn would
go up and knock him down to the ground.

482
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:05,243
As soon as he steps in the paint...

483
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:07,286
hit him.

484
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:10,457
Chuck Daly said,
"This is a 'Jordan Rule:'

485
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,959
every time he go to the basket,
put him on the ground."

486
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:15,420
He comes to the basket,
he ain't gonna dunk.

487
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:17,338
We gonna hit you.
You gonna be on the ground.

488
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,822
<i>Jordan is still down.</i>

489
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,776
We are trying
to physically hurt Michael.

490
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:24,095
<i>Jordan had no place to go.
Clobbered.</i>

491
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,890
How bad do you want it?

492
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:30,810
Are you willing to be injured
to score a basket?

493
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:34,230
<i>The Pistons want to make
Jordan pay whenever he gets in the paint.</i>

494
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:37,984
The referees back then didn't
look to see if Michael was hurt or not.

495
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:41,946
It wasn't, "Make sure
that the savior is okay," it wasn't...

496
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,406
That wasn't the way it is.

497
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:49,788
<i>It is over at the Palace.
The Pistons have beaten the Bulls.</i>

498
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:54,709
I could compare Michael Jordan to nobody
because for him to survive that

499
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:59,297
and still maintain that greatness,
I mean, it's very unparalleled.

500
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,217
We were not ready for the Detroit Pistons

501
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,593
at that point in time.

502
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:07,806
They were more physical than us.
Uh, they were the aggressors.

503
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,432
Detroit had our number.

504
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:13,394
<i>The Detroit Pistons,
by virtue of a 103-94 victory,</i>

505
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:16,523
<i>have eliminated the Bulls
and indeed are headed for the finals.</i>

506
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:19,484
<i>Unfortunately for the Bulls,
the story was the same.</i>

507
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:21,528
<i>"Control Michael and the win is yours."</i>

508
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,075
We did not have, as a unit,

509
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:30,411
the confidence that we felt
like we needed to beat Detroit.

510
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:32,447
<i>The game's over</i>

511
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,377
<i>and the Pistons have won
the world championship.</i>

512
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:38,711
<i>They're going down
in the record books</i>

513
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:42,257
<i>as one of the greatest defensive teams
ever in the history of this league.</i>

514
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:46,094
It seems that, in sports,
there's always that one team...

515
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,346
that you have to overcome,

516
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:52,559
and you almost build your team
to beat them,

517
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:57,480
and unequivocally, for the Bulls,
it was the Pistons.

518
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,784
A friend of Dennis Rodman
was worried enough

519
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:14,289
about the Piston's whereabouts overnight
that he called 911 to initiate a search.

520
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:18,209
Police found Rodman at the Palace
early this morning in Auburn Hills.

521
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:21,421
Rodman had taken
his legally registered rifle with him.

522
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:23,965
His mood characterized as despondent.

523
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:27,719
What happened?
Why are people concerned?

524
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:29,137
You get the right answer.

525
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,680
I'm here.

526
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:34,187
<i>That's Dennis
at 8:00 this morning,</i>

527
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:36,477
<i>trying to assure reporters that he's fine,</i>

528
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,980
<i>that he's not on the verge
of an emotional breakdown,</i>

529
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:42,233
<i>and that he did nothing
out of the ordinary, at least for him.</i>

530
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:47,238
The report that we have is
he took a gun, had a gun in his truck.

531
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:49,991
Uh, have you heard that,
can you confirm that?

532
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:52,785
I've heard that, yeah. That's all I know.

533
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:56,289
I had a gun in my hand,
like, in the front seat.

534
00:31:57,081 --> 00:32:01,169
Luckily, I fell asleep,
and the cops came and got me.

535
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:06,758
I was at a lost place at the time.
Just a lost place.

536
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:14,933
That time in my life, I think that was
both a wake-up call and a rescue call.

537
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:19,562
Last night may have been the last time
we see Dennis Rodman in a Pistons uniform.

538
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:22,982
<i>- Rodman used to be a Piston.
- He's out of there.</i>

539
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:27,028
<i>The Worm is now a Spur,
traded for Sean Elliott and David Wood.</i>

540
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,781
Dennis goes to San Antonio,

541
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:33,076
and then <i>Demolition Man</i> comes out,
and he changes his hair color.

542
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:34,786
That's me, that's Dennis Rodman.

543
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:37,580
I'm not trying to please anybody.

544
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:39,707
And Madonna goes, "He's cute."

545
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,960
And they started seeing each other.

546
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,712
Madonna explained to him,

547
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:48,341
"You have to establish
who you want to be in this life.

548
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:51,094
Don't be who they tell you you should be."

549
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:57,058
He started realizing
he can push to any boundary,

550
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:59,185
and that's a freedom.

551
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:03,106
People that write the things in the paper
don't really know Dennis Rodman.

552
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:06,776
They don't even talk to me so they have
to write something that's crazy and stupid

553
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:08,528
to make me look like an asshole.

554
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:12,031
I just wanna do something
that makes me feel like I'm free,

555
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:14,075
that I can go do anything I want to do.

556
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:16,744
What does it mean?
The outfits, the tattoos,

557
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:21,749
the sunglasses, the velvet hat,
the rings, the... stuff.

558
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:23,417
Why?

559
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:25,712
I like doing what I'm doing.

560
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:29,007
It makes me happy. It makes me feel
like I'm a ten-year-old kid.

561
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:32,468
Can I ask you to do one thing for me
before we leave this interview?

562
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:35,388
- Take off the hat.
- Why does everybody say that to me?

563
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:38,057
- Let me see what color it is.
- It's no color.

564
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,977
I've been pretty much lazy
and just, "Hell with it."

565
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,770
I'm thinking about shaving it off.

566
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:47,650
I wanted no part of Dennis.

567
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:49,193
Didn't want anything to do with him.

568
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:52,572
And, uh, Jimmy Stack,
who was my assistant at that point,

569
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:54,490
came to me, said,
"Let's talk about Rodman."

570
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:56,409
I said "No, I don't wanna
talk about Rodman."

571
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:59,328
And he said,
"Jerry, I've done some homework."

572
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:03,499
I really felt like I had
a different perspective on Dennis.

573
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:06,794
<i>Why, Dennis Rodman,
who already has a T...</i>

574
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:09,964
<i>...gets another one, and out he goes.</i>

575
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:13,885
Dennis was acting out in San Antonio.

576
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:19,974
But I felt like the structure we had, with
Michael and Scottie and the leadership,

577
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:23,811
Dennis would respect those guys
and play and thrive.

578
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,689
If we had not had
Michael and Scottie

579
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:29,692
and the people in that locker room,
we would've never taken Dennis.

580
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:32,695
If Phil hadn't been the coach,
I don't think we would've taken him.

581
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:34,864
Because I knew that Phil could handle him.

582
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:38,493
Do you remember
your first meeting with Rodman?

583
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:39,827
Oh, it was awful.

584
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:43,247
I walk into Jerry Krause's house.

585
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:48,127
He's sitting on the couch.
He's got a pool boy hat over his eyes,

586
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,755
he's got the rings in his nose
and his mouth,

587
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:54,300
and he doesn't stand up to meet me.
So I said, "Stand up, Dennis.

588
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:57,512
Take your hat off, shake hands.
Let's go outside and talk."

589
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:00,515
We had to break bread then, at the house.

590
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,725
He said "Dennis,
you wanna play for the Bulls?"

591
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:05,770
I said, "I don't care.
Whatever. What's up?"

592
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:07,814
Last week, the Bulls
announced the acquisition

593
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:09,524
of a player many people consider

594
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:12,193
the most controversial basketball star
in the NBA.

595
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:17,156
He is Dennis Rodman, one of the best
rebounders in NBA history.

596
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,701
Is it one of the shrewdest moves the Bulls
have ever made or one of the dumbest?

597
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,995
There was this visceral reaction
to Rodman.

598
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:26,624
Rodman was at the center
of the most hated team

599
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:28,042
in the history of Chicago.

600
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:32,547
We all thought, "Well, there's no way
they would ever accept him.

601
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:35,258
Even if they signed him,
they will never accept him."

602
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:37,260
You know, and to their credit,

603
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:40,263
Jordan and Pippen, especially, said,
"He can help us win.

604
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:42,348
We know how tough he is."

605
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,332
How did Dennis fit in
with the team when he first arrived?

606
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:51,983
Like a hand in a glove.

607
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:55,903
Dennis was a dominant
defensive player,

608
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:59,198
and what Dennis brought
was exactly what we needed,

609
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:02,535
somebody who gave us that edge
on the front line.

I played with.

623
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:40,364
He understood defensive strategy,
with all the rotations.

624
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,950
He had no limits in terms of what he does.

625
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,745
He could guard multiple players.

626
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:49,916
He studied each guy. He knew
players' strengths and weaknesses.

627
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,627
<i>Rodman with the interception...</i>

628
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,379
Dennis knows how to play
his role well.

629
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:59,800
He has a great understanding
of what it takes to win.

You know I was just kidding.

I know.
You gave me a good article the other day.

637
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:50,611
- I appreciate that.
- Which one?

638
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:52,770
You said, "Quit worrying
about what he's gonna do

639
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:55,564
and live for the present.
Don't worry about next year.

640
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:58,401
Leave him alone. Quit asking
questions about what's happening."

641
00:37:58,484 --> 00:37:59,724
I'm sick of it, too.

642
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:02,780
I'm tired of it, totally tired of it.
I'mma stop talking to y'all.

643
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:04,198
Just say, "Next question."

644
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,951
Y'all guys don't do it anymore,
but it's on the road.

645
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:08,595
- That's what kills me.
- Yeah.

646
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:11,789
It's gotta be
a little draining, every city, like,

647
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:14,625
"Is it Michael's last game?"
Everything that's going on with that.

648
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:17,837
Is it wearing on you a little?
Does it wear on you little bit?

649
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,047
Yeah, it gets old. Questions don't change

650
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:22,341
and the answer is the same.

651
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:25,136
Wouldn't it be nice if Bulls fans
could enjoy this title run

652
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:27,779
without worrying that it could be
the final running of the Bulls?

653
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:30,099
More questions in that vein
for Michael Jordan today.

654
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:32,184
You said
that this is your last year.

655
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:34,037
Is this your last outing
in the Bay Area?

656
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:35,330
Think it's your last season?

657
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:37,274
Is it Michael's final run
as a Bull?

658
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,084
Think it's your last time
in Atlanta?

659
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:41,610
- Should he retire?
- It's his decision.

660
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:44,447
We're required to ask
every game if you're gonna retire.

661
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,865
You're gonna get the same answer.

662
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:49,785
Although I may have the same answers,
I practice them quite a bit.

663
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,120
I don't know. I don't know.

664
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:52,872
You never know. You never know.

665
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:54,081
Beats me.

666
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:57,293
This may be the last time,
the last dance, whatever, but...

667
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:59,712
I'm not focusing on that,
I'm focusing on the moment.

668
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:02,548
Enjoy the moment, you know,
enjoy the game.

669
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:05,468
And whenever... Whatever happens
for this organization,

670
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:06,969
at the end of the season, happens.

671
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,322
What happens after that happens.

672
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:13,476
<i>I think people, well, the media basically,
are trying to redirect, trying to change</i>

673
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:17,521
<i>some kind of little emphasis within
the question and see if my answers change,</i>

674
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:18,939
and my response won't change.

675
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,983
So what about next year, Michael?

676
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:26,864
You guys are... I love you guys.
You're great. Excuse me.

677
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:42,213
Okay, everybody,
let's go meet the Sniff Brothers.

678
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:48,844
These are the Sniff Brothers over here.

679
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:52,306
First, there's Gus Sniff, CT Sniff,

680
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,059
Calvin Sniff, Tom Sniff.

681
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:57,102
- John Michael Sniff.
- That's John Michael Sniff.

682
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:57,978
George Sniff.

683
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,689
The Sniff Brothers.
They take care of Michael.

684
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:04,568
Sniff Brothers
are Michael's security guys.

685
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:07,363
A sniff brother
is actually a jock sniffer.

686
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:10,616
So we used to say everybody
was sniffing Michael's jocks.

687
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:12,284
All those guys would always be around.

688
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:16,789
He's the general sniff right here.
Brigadier General Gus Sniff.

689
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,917
Brigadier General.

690
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:23,170
All right.

691
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:25,589
Y'all get out of here.
We got a heated debate.

692
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:28,509
Heated debate about the president.
Y'all gotta get out of here.

693
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:31,429
He'll be running the country
next week.

694
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:33,055
Gus is gonna be running the country.

695
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:35,182
If the president
had Sniff Brothers,

696
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:36,559
he wouldn't have this problem.

697
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,482
That'll pay for your fine.

698
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:46,235
Oh, yeah? It'll pay for my fine, see?

699
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:48,571
See what I'm saying?

700
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:52,575
All people that's in the business are
crooked, too. I'm letting you know.

701
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:56,162
That was Craig Sager gave me
20 bucks to pay for my fine.

702
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:59,345
- Sounds like a bribe. Report him.
- That's what I'm saying.

703
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:02,543
He must want to interview me.
He wants something. That's his problem.

704
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:06,714
He's just saying hi.

705
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:10,593
Thank you so much.

706
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:13,378
They love you so much.

707
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:15,848
...the entertainment...
Anyway, entertainment...

708
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:17,016
Here you go, dude.

709
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:20,311
Oh, my God! Thank you!

710
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:21,479
Just a signature!

711
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:24,565
Please, Mr. Rodman. Thank you so much.

712
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:27,485
Y'all like Chicago?

713
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:29,737
- Yes, it's awesome.
- We love it.

714
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,364
- You need to come to Nashville sometime.
- No, hell no.

715
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:35,201
I've been to Nashville, brother, uh-uh.
No.

716
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:54,303
Two months ago, Scottie Pippen said
he would never play for the Bulls again.

717
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:58,474
But he softened his stance, saying he was
looking forward to returning to the team.

718
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:00,893
So the question became
when would he come back?

719
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:03,737
What made you
change your mind?

720
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:07,441
- Change my mind about coming to play?
- Yeah.

721
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:11,362
I just... I knew that it was
probably going to come down

722
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:15,324
to me and the team
trying to play hardball,

723
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:17,701
and I would lose in that situation

724
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:21,580
because they would start to fine me,
probably, so, uh...

725
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:26,877
I wasn't going to let them benefit
in that way.

726
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:34,218
Bottom line is, uh, I was willing
to accept a trade if they did it.

727
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:36,679
And I knew they wasn't going to do it.

728
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:39,932
<i>After watching 35 games
from the bench,</i>

729
00:42:40,015 --> 00:42:43,811
<i>the Bulls forward suited up at the
United Center tonight and took the court.</i>

730
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:47,022
<i>As for Dennis Rodman,
check out the newest hairstyle.</i>

731
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:51,235
<i>Word is that those are 33s in tribute
to Pippen's return.</i>

732
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:54,280
<i>Pippen ended up playing
31 minutes,</i>

733
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:57,700
<i>scoring 14 points, grabbing four rebounds,
dishing out five assists,</i>

734
00:42:57,783 --> 00:43:01,328
<i>and the Bulls have to feel uplifted
by having Pippen back.</i>

735
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,747
<i>When Scottie wasn't there,</i>

736
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:06,959
<i>Dennis loved the fact
that Michael needed him.</i>

737
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:09,003
Hey, Dennis...

738
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:13,090
Let me know when Oakley's gonna
set a back screen on me.

739
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:15,610
- He set that screen right there so he...
- Yeah.

740
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:17,469
You want me to open up and just hold him?

741
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:20,681
If you have to switch out, switch out.

742
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:22,951
I can stop Houston right there,
Oak's gotta turn around,

743
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:25,615
- I can stop him as you catch up.
- When the clock is running down,

744
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:27,813
he's setting that screen,
and veering over the top...

745
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,357
switch in that situation.

746
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:34,862
He was, "Hey, Michael, it's me and you.
We got this."

747
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:38,324
And when Scottie came back,
that's when they lost him.

748
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:42,411
<i>When Scottie came back,
we've got the Three Amigos again,</i>

749
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:45,414
<i>and I'm pretty much the third wheel
of the family.</i>

750
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:52,212
Rodman's descent became dramatic,
his drinking, his partying,

751
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,757
his connection with reality.

752
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:57,468
People don't understand,

753
00:43:57,551 --> 00:44:00,721
it's just not basketball
that we have to deal with on this team.

754
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:07,478
It's the pressure of the bullshit,
you know. I'll play the game for free,

755
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:11,023
but you get paid for the bullshit
after you leave the floor.

756
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:14,610
<i>The public pressure, the media pressure.</i>

757
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:18,030
Get out of my face, I'm done. I'm done.

758
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:20,699
I'm not talking, man.

759
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,910
No comment. How about that one?

760
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:29,917
Basketball is simple, it's a simple game,

761
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,045
but when you leave this confined zone...

762
00:44:34,546 --> 00:44:36,090
It's hard, it's hard.

763
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:40,094
I never have to prove anything
to people in this country.

764
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:44,056
This business can kiss my ass. I don't
give a damn what they think about me.

765
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:48,644
Everybody understood
Dennis' impact on the group,

766
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:52,564
and we understood that he had,
uh, different, uh...

767
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:55,943
needs in his personal life than we did.

768
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,527
I'll play you something
from Michael.

769
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:07,287
<i>While Scottie was out,
Dennis was a model citizen,</i>

770
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:11,542
to a point where it was
driving him fucking insane.

771
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:14,878
So, when Scottie came back,

772
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:17,131
<i>Dennis wanted to take a vacation.</i>

773
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:22,386
I come to practice. Phil calls me, says,
"Dennis wants to tell you something."

774
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:26,890
When Dennis wants to tell me something,
I knew it's not something I want to hear.

775
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:28,892
It sounds...

776
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:32,271
So, Dennis says, "I need a vacation."

777
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:35,232
And I look at Phil,
"Phil, what do you mean, a vacation?"

778
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:37,735
He says, "He needs a vacation,
time off to let loose."

779
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:40,237
<i>I said, "Look, Phil, let me
tell you something, man.</i>

780
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:43,198
If anybody need a fucking vacation,
I need a vacation."

781
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:46,452
He says... We look at Dennis,
"Dennis, what are you gonna do?"

782
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:49,121
<i>He says, "Well, I need to go to Vegas."</i>

783
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:55,461
"Phil, you let this dude go to vacation,
we're not going to see him.

784
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:58,130
You let him go to Vegas,
we definitely not going to see him."

785
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:01,258
So, he looks at Dennis,
he says, "Dennis, well,

786
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:03,802
can your vacation be, like, 48 hours?"

787
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:05,554
And Dennis is like,

788
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:09,141
<i>"I got no other choice, I take whatever
you can give me, I'll take the 48 hours."</i>

789
00:46:09,224 --> 00:46:12,186
<i>"Forty-eight hours.
You got 48 hours, Dennis."</i>

790
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:15,814
I'm looking at Phil, "You ain't gonna
get that dude back in 48 hours.

791
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:17,775
I don't care what you say. He's done.

792
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:19,777
<i>Okay. 48 hours."</i>

793
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:24,656
If he leaves that room,
go straight to the airport... Boom!

794
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,950
They don't hear or see Dennis
for 48 hours.

795
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:30,078
I remember that.

796
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:33,207
I went to fucking Vegas.

797
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:45,928
Dennis was bizarre,
but I think what made it work was

798
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:48,972
Phil and Michael's understanding...

799
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:52,392
that to get the most
out of him on the court,

800
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:54,186
you had to give him some rope.

801
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:56,855
And they gave him a lot of rope.
