Playoff programs!

00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:18,935
Bulls-Charlotte program!

3
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,122
- What time is it?
- Game time!

4
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:24,482
<i>In Chicago,
game one of round two.</i>

5
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:27,286
<i>Pregame with the Bulls
and the Hornets. Who's gonna win?</i>

6
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,779
<i>I believe the Bulls
are gonna win by 18 points.</i>

7
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,591
- <i>The Bulls'll win by 13.
- Blowout city. Bulls.</i>

8
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:34,343
<i>- Clean sweep.
- All right.</i>

9
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:35,660
<i>It will be a sweep.</i>

10
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:38,913
By then,
I was playing for Charlotte,

11
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:42,709
and... look, let's just be honest here.

12
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:47,297
The Bulls were a far superior team,
and they knew it.

13
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,376
<i>Now it's Michael.</i>

14
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,979
<i>Spinning, shooting over Wesley,
and there's his first basket.</i>

15
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:06,316
<i>If the Hornets
don't contain Jordan,</i>

16
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,818
<i>look for this to be a very short series.</i>

17
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,658
<i>Phil Jackson smiling
at game's end.</i>

18
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,870
<i>His team now 4-0 in this year's playoffs.</i>

19
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,706
We lost the first one,

20
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:25,585
but I thought I knew that system
as well as anybody.

21
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:27,837
And I knew how to beat them.

22
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,973
<i>Here is BJ Armstrong
with a jumper.</i>

23
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:40,737
<i>That was just bad defense.</i>

24
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,019
<i>And BJ Armstrong...</i>

25
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,855
<i>pushing it up, guarded by Kerr.</i>

26
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:49,651
<i>And now BJ Armstrong,
the former Chicago Bull,</i>

27
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:52,695
<i>hits a basket to give the Hornets
a three-point lead.</i>

28
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,490
<i>BJ Armstrong
getting more minutes</i>

29
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:57,075
<i>than he usually has this year.</i>

30
00:01:57,158 --> 00:02:00,995
<i>Perhaps his knowledge of the Bulls
is part of Dave Cowens' thinking here.</i>

31
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:05,125
<i>Here's Armstrong.
Trying to push it up again.</i>

32
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,501
<i>And Armstrong hits,</i>

33
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:10,338
<i>and now the Hornets can't miss
as Phil Jackson wants a timeout.</i>

34
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,125
I was excited to face them
in the playoffs,

35
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:18,471
knowing what I knew about the Bulls,
what I knew about Michael,

36
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:22,058
and to see if everything that
I had learned would actually work.

37
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:26,020
Michael was Michael, but anybody
can have a moment. I just had a moment.

38
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:29,482
And in that moment, I knew what to do.

39
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:32,944
<i>Out to BJ
with 30 seconds to go.</i>

40
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:35,530
<i>BJ against his former teammate, Michael.</i>

41
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,699
<i>Here come the Hornets
with a three-point lead.</i>

42
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:39,617
<i>Hornets can hold on to this ball.</i>

43
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:43,955
<i>Jordan against Armstrong.
Armstrong backs up to the sideline.</i>

44
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:46,708
<i>Works off a Divac screen
to the right wing, pull-up pop.</i>

45
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:47,791
<i>And it's good!</i>

46
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:52,005
<i>BJ gives the Hornets
a five-point lead</i>

47
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:57,427
<i>with 17.8 seconds to go. Timeout, Chicago.</i>

48
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:59,554
I hit that shot...

49
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:03,391
and I remember, I let Michael know.

50
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,897
I let Phil Jackson know,
I let Scottie know,

51
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,399
I let everyone
that I knew over there know.

52
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:13,985
<i>The Hornets
have evened the series</i>

53
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:17,322
<i>in a stunning upset
over the Chicago Bulls.</i>

54
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:22,911
<i>Believe me, fans,
no Hornet is happier than BJ Armstrong.</i>

55
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:27,123
<i>For him, this is not just a ball game,
this is vindication.</i>

56
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:30,376
<i>This is "get back in your face," big-time.</i>

57
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,463
<i>He just opened up a can of "Whoop-Bulls."</i>

58
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,507
I felt like BJ
should know better.

59
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:40,511
If you're gonna high-five, talk trash,
now I had a bone to pick with you.

60
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:44,641
I'm supposed to kill this guy,
I'm supposed to dominate this guy,

61
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,768
and from that point on, I did.

62
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,189
<i>A spectacular move!</i>

63
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:52,857
<i>The game's over!</i>

64
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,276
<i>Chicago Stadium is going wild!</i>

65
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,423
<i>First of all,
there's no backstabbing going on here.</i>

66
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:00,758
<i>It's time for me to move on.</i>

67
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:03,342
<i>This will be Phil's last year
as the coach of the Bulls.</i>

68
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:08,831
<i>- Are the expectations too high?
- Where do we go from here?</i>

69
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,835
<i>The only question:
how long can it last?</i>

70
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,513
Earlier in the show, you saw the vision

71
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,641
<i>of how the Hornets shocked the Bulls
78-76 in Chicago</i>

72
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:28,685
<i>to even that best-of-seven series at one,</i>

73
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,979
<i>and it was a former Bull, BJ Armstrong,</i>

74
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,542
whose jumper, with 18 ticks left,
sealed the win for Charlotte.

75
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:35,692
<i>After, the reaction...</i>

76
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,904
Michael holds himself
to such a high level.

77
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:43,908
When you've played as long as he did,
at the level he did,

78
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:48,371
he constructed reasons
to play hard that night.

79
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:54,043
These little slights
were deep indignations to him.

80
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,881
That's all he needs.
That's like throwing meat to a tiger.

81
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,969
He'd find a game within the game
to keep him interested.

82
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,388
But it was all in his mind.

83
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:08,141
<i>The second straight year
the Bulls lost game two...</i>

84
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:11,269
Do you know the LaBradford Smith story?
Has anybody told you that?

85
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,354
This was back in '93.

86
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:16,524
<i>At one guard from
Louisville, LaBradford Smith.</i>

87
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:20,653
The Bullets were terrible.
LaBradford Smith was their draft pick,

88
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:23,406
but this is what I always say,
"You never know.

89
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,783
It could be your night. You never know."

90
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:29,620
This night...
was LaBradford Smith's night.

91
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:32,040
<i>LaBradford Smith,
left wing, drains it.</i>

92
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:36,002
<i>LaBradford Smith came off the screen,
from 16. Wow!</i>

93
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:39,881
<i>Baseline. Smith has hit everything else
from there, why not another one?</i>

94
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:44,260
LaBradford Smith had a game.
I mean, he had a game of games.

95
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,196
<i>...Jordan posted up
against Smith.</i>

96
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,740
For whatever reason,
Michael couldn't make a basket.

97
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:51,100
<i>Spins in the lane,
couldn't get it.</i>

98
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,145
<i>LaBradford Smith with a move, and...</i>

99
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:56,814
<i>Michael hits him
on the body... He nails it.</i>

100
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,567
<i>Smith, he has really got that touch going.</i>

101
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,737
<i>Not talking about him,
we're talking about LaBradford Smith.</i>

102
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:07,950
In Chicago, LaBradford Smith scores
37 points against Michael Jordan.

103
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,788
He said thatLaBradford Smith,
walking out of the gym,

104
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,581
had said, "Nice game, Mike."

105
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,628
You knew that wasn't gonna go down well.

106
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:22,673
The next night, they play in Washington.

107
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:25,676
We played 'em back-to-back.
So, we're flying to Washington.

108
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:31,224
He said, "Tomorrow, in the first half,
I'm gonna have...

109
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,726
what this kid had in the game."

110
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:40,108
I've never seen a man go after
another player the way he did.

111
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,031
<i>You saw that coming.</i>

112
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:50,451
<i>I think he's made his statement.</i>

113
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:54,163
Jordan scores 36 in the first half.

114
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:58,626
<i>He's concentrating
almost solely on LaBradford.</i>

115
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:03,256
He took such umbrage at a guy saying,
"Nice game, Mike,"

116
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:08,010
that he torched and humiliated him
in front of 20,000 people.

117
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:14,809
Fast forward to decades past the incident,

118
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,395
and there's a rumor this never happened.

119
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:20,857
Smith never put his arm around Mike
and said, "Nice game, Mike."

120
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:26,279
A couple of writers went up to Michael
and said, "Did this ever happen?"

121
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:29,282
Michael, with a smile,
was just like, "No, I made it up."

122
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:35,997
There's nothing he would not do
to get himself to the place

123
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,540
where he's going to beat you.

124
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:46,632
You pissed off about last night?

125
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:47,716
Uh-uh.

126
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,721
Why? You think I should be?

127
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,640
So what? We lost one game.

128
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,184
Okay.

129
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,646
It'll be a dogfight tomorrow.

130
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:05,693
With BJ hittin' that shot and staring
the whole bench down and whatnot,

131
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,988
it just didn't sit well with Michael,
and we knew.

132
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:12,742
In the locker room, we said,
"Listen, guys, we're gonna have a dogfight

133
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:16,871
from here on out because
we have woke Michael Jordan up."

134
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:17,954
Yeah.

135
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,083
I mean, that's all right.

136
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,630
Let's see if all that trash-talking starts
when it's zero-zero

137
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:28,424
instead of five, six-point lead.

138
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:30,843
That's where it starts.

139
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:36,265
That's the sign of a good man,
if you can talk shit when it's even score,

140
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:40,728
or talk shit when you're behind score.
When you're ahead, it's easy to talk.

141
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:49,695
Mike does not need any more gas
in his car to get going.

142
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,864
But then when you do that,

143
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:57,870
you have to expect all hell
to break loose from that point on.

144
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,542
And, yeah, that's what happened.

145
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,554
All right.
Let's bring our best game.

146
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:15,680
Come on.

147
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,765
Let's play hard. Get pissed.

148
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,183
Payback is a motherfucker.

149
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,726
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

150
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,104
- What time is it?
- Game time!

151
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,983
<i>Armstrong at the top,
shadowed by Michael.</i>

152
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,610
<i>Gives up his dribble,
pressured by Michael.</i>

153
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:30,736
He came after me

154
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,864
in the rest of the series,
especially that next game.

155
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,284
<i>Armstrong, top of the circle.</i>

156
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:39,412
<i>Michael all over him.
Armstrong, nowhere to go.</i>

157
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:43,249
<i>Jordan with a turnaround
over Armstrong. He knew he had him.</i>

158
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:46,377
<i>So the Hornets take Armstrong
off of Jordan momentarily.</i>

159
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,460
<i>Armstrong tonight,
only two points on one-of-seven shooting.</i>

160
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:53,259
<i>Michael Jordan has 20,
and the Bulls doing everything right.</i>

161
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,387
<i>♪ Let the man go through ♪</i>

162
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,223
<i>♪ Move aside
And let the man go through ♪</i>

163
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,017
<i>♪ Let the man go through ♪</i>

164
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:04,604
<i>The Bulls coming back,
winning the game they had to win.</i>

165
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,901
I think BJ kind of forgot what drives us.

166
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:16,657
He woke us up, if we were in a sleep,
and we've been able to capitalize on that.

167
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:21,680
<i>Welcome to
game four of this series with the Hornets,</i>

168
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,748
<i>the home club, trailing two games to one.</i>

169
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,168
<i>Here's the steal!</i>

170
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,339
<i>And count the basket.</i>

171
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:34,008
<i>The Bulls win it 94-80.</i>

172
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,211
<i>The Bulls
have just taken their heart.</i>

173
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,637
<i>That's what the Bulls do to you.</i>

174
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,032
<i>Jordan getting a step,
Rice stays with him.</i>

175
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:42,183
<i>And Jordan scores anyway.</i>

176
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:45,770
<i>And the final score, 93-84,</i>

177
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:48,856
<i>as the Bulls knock out the Hornets in five</i>

178
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:51,442
<i>and will now face the Indiana Pacers.</i>

179
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,945
Halfway home. The way I look at it.

180
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,994
Better watch out.
We may go undefeated from here on in.

181
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:17,778
The fact of the matter is,

182
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,638
in my opinion, if Michael had stayed
with baseball,

183
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,473
he would've gotten to the major leagues.

184
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:27,978
But when the baseball strike
started in '94

185
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:31,982
and Major League Baseball came up
with what was a really dumb idea

186
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:34,819
of trying to start the season
with replacement players.

187
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,946
Today, in spring training camps
across the nation,

188
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:41,075
replacement baseball players
facing replacement baseball players.

189
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:47,081
There was a strike that year, and
they asked him to cross the picket line.

190
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:49,291
Michael said, "No, I'm not doing that."

191
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,086
Michael Jordan has said all along
that he will not play

192
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,796
in replacement games during the strike.

193
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:58,509
A man of his word, Jordan today walked out
of the White Sox camp.

194
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:06,225
One day, he called me
and said, "I'm in town.

195
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,437
What are you doing?"
I said, "I'm about to go to practice,

196
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,481
you know the routine."
He was like, "Let's meet at...

197
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,734
Bakers Square." I said, "All right."

198
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:18,487
After breakfast,
we eat our little pancakes,

199
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,949
and I was like, "I gotta go to practice."
I was like,

200
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:26,036
"Why don't you just come over? Say hello.
Everybody would like to see you."

201
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,164
Morning.

202
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,168
He comes over to practice,

203
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,295
and I started telling him,

204
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:36,797
"You old, you been out of the game.
You can't play no more.

205
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:40,468
I'll kick your ass right now."
More or less.

206
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:42,887
First, it was a joke,

207
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:46,307
and before I knew it,
we were playing a full one-on-one.

208
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:50,269
I just could feel something different
was going on that day.

209
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,980
You just had a different feeling
in that locker room,

210
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:56,233
and I remember asking Harp,
"What's going on?"

211
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:59,361
And Harp just turned to me and said,
"The man is here."

212
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,740
Super Mike working out
yesterday with his old teammates.

213
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:06,452
Is this a trend
or just scratching his basketball itch?

214
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:10,664
Just the hint that Michael Jordan
might be returning to the NBA

215
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:14,084
sent newsrooms and reporters
scurrying all day today.

216
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:18,380
Too much speculation. There are too many
ifs and too many things to be worked out.

217
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:22,510
Trying to guess what Mike will do next
has become a full-time hobby for many.

218
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:26,931
It started to come into my mind,
"Maybe go back, maybe go back."

219
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,767
Scottie, actually, on TV,

220
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,269
with the shoes up,
telling me to come back.

221
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:35,773
<i>Did you see
Scottie pointing to the Air Jordan emblem</i>

222
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:37,066
<i>on the bottom of his sneaker?</i>

223
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,527
<i>Will the basketball great
return to the Bulls?</i>

224
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,987
<i>Jordan participated
in the Bulls practice</i>

225
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,739
<i>for the third time in a week.</i>

226
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,534
The MJ watch continues
among fans, the media,

227
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,786
and his possible future teammates,

228
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:50,246
but even with fingers crossed,

229
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:53,624
not everyone believes
that Michael is really coming back.

230
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,793
I would be surprised if he came back.

231
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,754
The sports world hangs on the next word
of Michael Jordan.

232
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,548
But he isn't talking yet.

233
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:03,676
But only Jordan knows the answer
everyone's looking for,

234
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:06,846
and it seems he'll share it
in his own good time.

235
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,767
So, finally, after all this stuff,
he called me and he said,

236
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,394
"I think I'm ready to come back."

237
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:17,481
So I wrote three or four
different versions, you know,

238
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:20,484
of the press release, for him to announce
he was coming back,

239
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:25,239
but he didn't feel comfortable that
it had captured what he wanted to say.

240
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,825
So I said,
"Why don't you freaking write one?"

241
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,785
I gave him the pen and paper
and he just wrote.

242
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,581
That's all he needed to say.

243
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,209
<i>The sign says it all.</i>

244
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:40,004
<i>Now, Bulls fans can take
a deep breath and relax.</i>

245
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:43,549
<i>We no longer have to endure life
without Michael.</i>

246
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,009
<i>The drought is over.</i>

247
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,969
<i>Jordan is back.</i>

248
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,054
We should all bow our heads
in a moment of silence

249
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,849
in recognition of Jordan's return
to pro basketball.

250
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:55,477
<i>Chicago sports fans riding
high on Air Jordan these days.</i>

251
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,206
<i>Word from the Windy City,
Air Jordan is back with the Bulls.</i>

252
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,317
<i>All seems right in the world
because MJ's back.</i>

253
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,738
He sends the famous fax out,
"I'm back."

254
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:07,907
And it was shocking

255
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:12,202
given that we were almost
at the end of the season.

256
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:17,333
<i>The Chicago Bulls are barely
above .500 with a 34-31 record.</i>

257
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:21,253
That '94-'95 season, we struggled.

258
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:24,882
We lost Horace Grant
when he went to Orlando,

259
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:26,884
and that was really upsetting.

260
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:30,971
Yesterday afternoon, Bulls owner
Jerry Reinsdorf cut ties with Grant.

261
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:34,391
They could have extended his contract
and they didn't.

262
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:37,728
And then Horace Grant goes out
and becomes the star with Orlando.

263
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:40,564
<i>Here's Horace! In person!</i>

264
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:43,901
That year, the Bulls had missed
that power forward, that rebounder,

265
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:46,153
that defensive presence
with the loss of Grant.

266
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,531
It wasn't the previous season where

267
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,993
we had the residual effect
of the championships

268
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:56,080
and the foundation and the core group.

269
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,833
We were kind of a mess the next year.
We weren't that good.

270
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,544
So, when Michael came back,
it gave us new life.

271
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:03,628
It was like...

272
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:07,508
"Wait a second, you know, we can...
we can do this again."

273
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,650
When Michael first came back,

274
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:15,099
he's like, "Billy, we're finally gonna
get to play together.

275
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:16,767
I want you to jump on the cape.

276
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,019
But you need to hold on."

277
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:22,147
"All right."
That set the tone from day one.

278
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,817
After the baseball,
he was even more committed.

279
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,695
More... goal oriented,

280
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:30,239
and the goals were only
winning a championship.

281
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,699
Winning a championship.

282
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:39,790
Today's the day
basketball fans have been waiting for.

283
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,459
After an absence of a year and a half,

284
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:45,004
superstar Michael Jordan
is back in the game,

285
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:48,590
and he'll play with the Bulls later today
against the Indiana Pacers.

286
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:57,766
We landed and we got off the airplane.
I was waiting for Michael.

287
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,269
Waited a few minutes and whatnot,

288
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,771
and I think Michael was just having
a quiet emotional time

289
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,189
on the plane by himself 'cause...

290
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:08,777
this is the first time he was gonna play
without his father being around.

291
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,612
And, uh, it hit him hard.

292
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:15,200
And he was tearing up a little bit,

293
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:19,204
and I said, "Hey, you got this.
You ready to go?"

294
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:22,332
"Yeah. Just give me a minute.
I'll be with you in a minute."

295
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:28,839
I was nervous...

296
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:34,261
'cause I hadn't played competitive
in a long time.

297
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:39,183
And I just felt naked, you know,
because my father just wasn't there.

298
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,269
So different.

299
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:46,065
Playing a game
without his dad being there...

300
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:51,653
I think that brought James' death
back to light for him.

301
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,906
MJ's in town!

302
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,741
Who needs tickets? Four together.

303
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:56,824
$150 each.

304
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:59,119
- I give you $200.
- Give me $225.

305
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,455
Been offered two grand
for these tickets. Said, "No way."

306
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,416
This is as close to the Super Bowl
I'm ever gonna come.

307
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,711
What Michael Jordan does today

308
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,130
and what he will attempt to do
in the next several months

309
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,674
or maybe years is truly unprecedented.

310
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:16,428
He doesn't want to simply be effective
or even be an All-Star.

311
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,972
He wants to be the best again.
He wants to dominate.

312
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:22,559
Can he? And if he can,
are the Bulls a championship contender?

313
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:30,275
The atmosphere in Market Square
was electric.

314
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,152
We ran out onto the floor,

315
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:38,033
and the air was thick
with anticipation and anxiety.

316
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,660
It felt like the Finals.

317
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:43,163
Oh, boy. Listen to the
reaction here at Market Square Arena

318
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,873
as Michael took the court.

319
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:48,627
It was an emotional moment.
There he was. He was back.

320
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:54,508
<i>Twenty-one months after
his last appearance in an NBA game,</i>

321
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:59,221
<i>Michael Jordan has returned
and he's wearing number 45.</i>

322
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,932
I didn't want to go with 23

323
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,351
because I knew my father wasn't there
to watch me,

324
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:06,687
and I felt it was a new beginning.

325
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:10,023
And 45 was my first number
when I played in high school.

326
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:14,736
<i>The much-heralded return
of superstar Michael Jordan</i>

327
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,238
<i>got off to a rocky start.</i>

328
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:20,492
<i>His shooting touch was missing,
and his shorts were on backwards.</i>

329
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:25,831
<i>He struggled, trying to
shake off the rust, and it showed.</i>

330
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:29,501
<i>Michael, outside, inside,
couldn't get it to go.</i>

331
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:33,130
<i>Then the patented drive.
Rik Smits gets a piece of it.</i>

332
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:35,215
<i>Michael, 0-for-6 from the floor.</i>

333
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,551
<i>Then the old Jordan would finally emerge.</i>

334
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:41,388
<i>MJ, the steal from Rik Smits,
and takes it the distance.</i>

335
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:45,601
<i>The Pacers would get the last word,
and they look to Reggie Miller.</i>

336
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:51,940
<i>Not quite a Disney ending
for Michael Jordan, but he's back.</i>

337
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,362
Being away
from the game that long,

338
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:00,407
and just how much the body had changed,

339
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:03,035
I was very unsure...

340
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,038
that he could perform

341
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:11,627
at the level that he's accustomed
to performing on a regular basis.

342
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:18,175
That just added more pressure to prove
he's still Michael Jordan,

343
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:23,388
and that was part of his greatness,
was never being satisfied.

344
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:28,101
<i>The inbound to Michael.
Racing the clock.</i>

345
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,313
<i>Jordan for the win...</i>

346
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:32,606
<i>Yes!</i>

347
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,483
<i>He is now back!</i>

348
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:38,987
<i>Holy mackerel! And it was vintage Jordan.</i>

349
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:42,407
When he came back,
we were full power again.

350
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:43,825
Yeah, we were off and running.

351
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:47,454
Well, the big star plays a big city,
and that makes for very big news.

352
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:50,624
The Michael Jordan comeback tour
sets down at Madison Square Garden.

353
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:52,209
Tip-off in about 90 minutes.

354
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,262
<i>Anybody who was everybody,
or everybody who was anybody,</i>

355
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:06,556
<i>on hand to watch Michael's return
to the Garden.</i>

356
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,934
<i>They would not be disappointed.</i>

357
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:13,272
<i>Jordan... 15-footer.
Look out!</i>

358
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:17,401
<i>Jordan is 2-for-2 to start this game.</i>

359
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:19,569
<i>Double team, Oakley gets there. Too late!</i>

360
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:22,614
<i>Michael is four of five.</i>

361
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:27,494
<i>Jordan... starts out on fire.</i>

362
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:32,499
After that long layoff,
he was able to come back

363
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:34,960
and have one of his best games
in the Garden.

364
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:37,296
<i>♪ Nope, shut him down
The king with a crown ♪</i>

365
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,589
<i>♪ 'Cause all you wanna be
is Diggy Down ♪</i>

366
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:44,136
It's unfortunate because I think I had
a great game that game as well,

367
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:46,263
but no one remembers that.

368
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:48,682
<i>Fourteen ticks left, tie game.</i>

369
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:50,809
<i>Jordan. You've gotta double team him.</i>

370
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:55,397
<i>Wennington!</i>

371
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,359
<i>He made a pass when he had to.
Bulls win. He's back.</i>

372
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:02,446
<i>Jordan scores 55
in just his fifth game back.</i>

373
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:08,243
When he came back
and he scored 55 in the Garden,

374
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,787
I'm thinking, "Oh, man,

375
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:15,000
it's gonna be crazy if we meet them
in the playoffs."

376
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:23,592
<i>We're set for game one of
the Eastern Conference Semifinals series</i>

377
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,052
<i>between the Bulls and the Magic.</i>

378
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:27,971
I felt great about that year.

379
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:33,393
We had some very good young players
in Shaquille O'Neal...

380
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,354
<i>Nice move by Shaquille.</i>

381
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:37,081
...Penny Hardaway...

382
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:39,208
<i>Hardaway,
down the lane to hammer it home.</i>

383
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:40,275
...Nick Anderson.

384
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,694
<i>...Shawn Bradley.
He'll challenge him into the hole!</i>

385
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:46,740
I knew Michael. He was still
working himself back into condition.

386
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:54,873
<i>Horace Grant, the one-time
Chicago Bull, able to control.</i>

387
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:57,959
All the world's a stage
when your name is Michael Jordan,

388
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,629
so the spotlight
that shines brightly on your triumphs

389
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,464
also burns intensely on your mistakes.

390
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:05,842
On Sunday in Orlando,
Jordan had more than a bit-part

391
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:09,012
during the closing scene
in game one, fourth quarter.

392
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:12,974
Bulls up 91-90. 22 seconds to go.

393
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:18,146
So the Bulls up one.
Michael's got the ball in his hands.

394
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,230
Not any longer.

395
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:24,152
Penny to the former Bull, Horace Grant.
Magic up by one.

396
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:32,119
When Michael came back
from playing baseball,

397
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:34,246
and Nick Anderson stole his rock,

398
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:35,705
the reason that stood out,

399
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:38,625
you hadn't seen anybody
take Michael's rock in a long time.

400
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:44,464
It's like watching Muhammad Ali
in the second half of his career

401
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,675
when someone lands a punch on him.

402
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:49,219
It's like,
"You mean, you can hit this guy?"

403
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:54,975
<i>Jordan still
had a chance to deliver</i>

404
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:57,018
<i>one of his patented buzzer-beaters,</i>

405
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,812
<i>but instead he threw it away.</i>

406
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:01,106
<i>He dropped it out of bounds!</i>

407
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:04,651
This just in: Michael Jordan is human.

408
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:07,863
In crunch time, gives up a steal,
throws the ball away, Bulls lose.

409
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:14,703
After the game, Nick Anderson said,
"45 isn't 23."

410
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:17,164
Oh, man.

411
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:20,667
<i>Obviously,
Jordan is superstitious.</i>

412
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:24,421
<i>45 is in mothballs. 23 is back.</i>

413
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:28,091
I just felt like 45 wasn't natural.

414
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:31,219
I wanted to go back to the feeling
I had with 23.

415
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:35,056
When we met them in the next game...

416
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,059
MJ just went off.

417
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,937
<i>Pippen... finds Michael.</i>

418
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:42,856
<i>The pull up.</i>

419
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:44,191
<i>It's down for a three.</i>

420
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:46,735
<i>That first quick step,
that jump stop,</i>

421
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,403
<i>the lean-in, that's a tough shot.</i>

422
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,989
<i>Averaged 11 field goals attempts
during the regular season.</i>

423
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:53,325
<i>Jordan with the block
on O'Neal!</i>

424
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:54,534
<i>Oh, baby!</i>

425
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:57,787
<i>Bulls back.
Jordan looking to go to the basket.</i>

426
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,207
<i>How about... On cue.</i>

427
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,333
<i>That's a big play!</i>

428
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:04,878
<i>Oh, my! Scott had it
blocked by Jordan. Over the back.</i>

429
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:06,213
<i>This could be entertaining.</i>

430
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:10,175
<i>Chicago gets the win 104-94.</i>

431
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:16,348
<i>Jordan un-retires number 23,
shocks the world. Bulls win game two.</i>

432
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,518
<i>The Bulls pulled even
with the Magic,</i>

433
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:22,979
<i>but does Jordan have the legs
to last throughout the playoffs?</i>

434
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:24,731
He was not 100% of himself.

435
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:28,151
That year, he was
80-something percent of himself.

436
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:30,820
<i>You're looking at
an exhausted Jordan.</i>

437
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,704
Obviously,
he's not in great shape.

438
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:36,243
He's in "I've been playing baseball
for 21 months" shape.

439
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:39,246
He didn't have time
to get his legs underneath him,

440
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:42,791
and that was reflected in some
of the postseason games that year.

441
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,876
<i>The Magic are one win away</i>

442
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,256
<i>from eliminating Michael Jordan
and the Bulls from the playoffs.</i>

443
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:51,758
There are a couple of things
wrong with Chicago right now.

444
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:54,302
They didn't have Michael
for the course of the season

445
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:58,056
so while other players are in great shape
and can go game in and game out,

446
00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:01,810
Michael has not been able to sustain
the effort over the course of a game.

447
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:06,773
Looking back, I didn't have enough time
to prepare my body for basketball.

448
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,110
So I was a little nervous
going into that playoff.

449
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:13,488
<i>As the Bulls teeter
on the brink of elimination,</i>

450
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:16,700
<i>tonight, the Magic will try
to give them a little push.</i>

451
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:19,035
<i>It is a one-point
Bulls lead.</i>

452
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:22,998
<i>Orlando has reeled off
seven straight points.</i>

453
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,584
<i>Tough shot by Michael. Air ball.</i>

454
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:28,003
<i>A chance for Orlando to take the lead.</i>

455
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:31,548
<i>I don't remember
seeing Michael Jordan this tired.</i>

456
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:33,133
<i>This is unbelievable.</i>

457
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:34,759
<i>Eight seconds on the shot clock.</i>

458
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,928
<i>Let Anderson
go against Kukoc.</i>

459
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,972
<i>- Take him to the basket.
- Five.</i>

460
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:42,642
<i>Oh, my goodness!
What a shot by Nick Anderson!</i>

461
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:47,147
<i>It's all over.
The Bulls season comes to an end.</i>

462
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:51,443
<i>Here at the United Center,
the Orlando Magic gets the victory.</i>

463
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,280
<i>Look at Horace,
they're booing him,</i>

464
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:56,865
<i>but he's up on their shoulders, Bob.</i>

465
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:00,453
That was
one of Michael's lowest points,

466
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:02,621
is when he came back and they didn't win.

467
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,416
He hated the fact that Horace was on
the other team when they beat him.

468
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:11,129
And just to watch all the celebrating
that they were doing,

469
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:14,257
I think that's what he took to heart.

470
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:18,845
He used that for that next year.

471
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:22,307
After the season,

472
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:27,562
usually there's a time period
where Michael takes some time off.

473
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:31,441
The night they lost to Orlando,

474
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:34,611
I said, "Michael, you know,
I'm about to get out of here.

475
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:36,488
Let me know when you want me to see you."

476
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,657
He goes, "I'll see you tomorrow."

477
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:45,997
Michael had an obligation
to himself, the fans,

478
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:50,335
his teammates, the organization,
his family.

479
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:51,336
Everybody.

480
00:27:51,337 --> 00:27:56,091
He said, "If you're going to sit down
and take three hours out of your day...

481
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,844
to watch me on TV,

482
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:04,641
I have an obligation to give you my best.

483
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:10,230
To give you my best, all the time."

484
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:22,200
And action!

485
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:28,330
Cut!

486
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:32,961
The summer after Michael came back,
he was filming the movie <i>Space Jam.</i>

487
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:37,173
NBA superstar Michael Jordan
starts filming his movie this summer

488
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:39,467
with longtime screen veteran Bugs Bunny.

489
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:42,303
Really, this is the truth.
The movie's called <i>Space Jam.</i>

490
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:46,975
<i>Here's the premise.
A bunch of aliens wanna kidnap Bugs.</i>

491
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:51,438
<i>Soon, there's a basketball game
and Michael Jordan joins the team.</i>

492
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:54,566
He knew that <i>Space Jam</i>
was not as important

493
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:57,986
as getting back and playing basketball
at the level he wanted to play at.

494
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,406
And while they were filming,
he went back to work.

495
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:06,661
I said, "Look, I need to practice.
I need a facility where I can work out."

496
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:09,330
"Don't worry about it.
We'll build you that."

497
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:13,918
Sure enough, when we came out there
to do the film, it was all set up.

498
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:16,171
We had the Jordan Dome.

499
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:19,215
It was like a professional facility.
Fabulous.

500
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:22,093
Beautiful floor, big dome, weights.

501
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,596
Grover was there, his workout guy.

502
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:29,768
The days would be
Monday through Saturday.

503
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,227
We start off at 7:00.

504
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:37,776
I would get a two-hour break
and I would go work out with Tim.

505
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:40,904
I had a whole program designed up,

506
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:43,948
working all the muscles
for going back to basketball.

507
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:48,286
I spent 15 months turning my body
into a baseball body.

508
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:51,915
Basketball is a little bit
more shoulders, chest.

509
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:55,585
So I had to reconstruct
my whole body, which was hard.

510
00:29:57,545 --> 00:30:01,633
And then after we finish,
usually around 7:00,

511
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:05,053
we would invite people
and we'd play pick-up games.

512
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:10,683
We had the idea if we invited

513
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:13,978
the best players in the league out here,

514
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:18,483
he would get a chance to see everybody
before the season started,

515
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:20,693
and then it became, like, a thing.

516
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,904
Everyone had to come out
to Warner Bros. studio

517
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:24,155
to play against Michael.

518
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:30,328
And this was an opportunity
for him to see everybody

519
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:32,121
and we would do scouting reports.

520
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:35,875
This is what Chris Mullin
and Reggie Miller would do.

521
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,252
We got Reggie Miller.

522
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:40,338
Patrick Ewing today. Shawn Bradley.

523
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:43,508
It was some of the best games.

524
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:46,970
There was no officials.
You're calling your own fouls.

525
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:50,098
So it was a little bit
more rugged and raw.

526
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,269
I don't know how he did it.

527
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,521
I don't know how he filmed all day...

528
00:30:57,146 --> 00:31:00,233
and then still had the energy
to play three hours.

529
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,820
I mean, we would play
until 9:00 or 10:00 at night.

530
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:06,114
He still had to get weightlifting in,

531
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,867
and then his call time was
at 6:00 or 7:00 in the morning

532
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:12,036
so I don't know how...
This dude was like a vampire. For real.

533
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:19,460
Playing against young talent,
they were full of energy

534
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:22,589
and I had to help excel my talent,
get my talents back.

535
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:32,140
Honestly, one of the best things
that could have possibly happened,

536
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:33,808
as much as everyone hates losing,

537
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:37,562
is that we lost to Orlando because Michael
came back with a vengeance.

538
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:43,985
When Michael came back, it was a new team.

539
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:48,781
Scottie was the only one still there
from the first championship team.

540
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:51,117
Michael hadn't played
with Luc Longley yet.

541
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,578
He hadn't played with Jud Buechler
and Steve Kerr yet,

542
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:55,580
and Bill Wennington and all those guys.

543
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:59,167
<i>That preseason
training camp was unbelievable.</i>

544
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,752
<i>You could tell he was on a mission.</i>

545
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:05,089
By the time camp started,
he was in incredible shape,

546
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:07,675
but he was also frothing at the mouth.

547
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:10,845
That's how angry he was from losing.

548
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:13,973
So every day at training camp
was just a war,

549
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:17,685
every day was a battle
and he talked a lot of shit.

550
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:20,813
I wanted them to understand
what it felt like to be in the trenches.

551
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:24,692
If you don't understand, then you're
not going to respond when the war starts.

552
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:28,571
Steve and Luc, all those guys,

553
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:33,368
they come in riding high on the three
championships that we won in '91, '92...

554
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:36,871
And they had no fucking, you know...
Anything to do with it.

555
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,540
But yet now they play
for the Bulls and they...

556
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,334
No, dude, it's... It's...

557
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:43,419
We were shit when I got there

558
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:46,714
and we got to elevate to being
a championship-quality team.

559
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,342
There's certain standards
that you have to live by.

560
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:51,052
You don't come pussyfooting around.

561
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:53,096
You don't come in joking
and kidding around.

562
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:55,014
You gotta come in ready to play.

563
00:32:56,474 --> 00:33:01,562
So, one day at practice,
Phil put Steve Kerr guarding me.

564
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:06,693
We're on opposite sides in a scrimmage
and he's talking all kinds of trash

565
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:10,071
and I'm pissed because, you know,
we're getting our ass kicked.

566
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:14,450
Phil sensed my aggression,
but he was trying to tone me down

567
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:17,245
and he starts calling
these ticky-tack fouls.

568
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:21,165
I'm getting mad because,
for you to be protecting this guy,

569
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:23,668
that's not gonna help us
when we play New York,

570
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:27,213
it's not going to help us when we play
these teams that are very physical.

571
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:30,508
Next time he did it, I just hauled off
and fucking... I said...

572
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:33,261
When I fouled Steve Kerr, I said,
"Now that's a fucking foul."

573
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:36,639
I have a lot of patience as a human being,

574
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:41,352
but I tend to snap at some point
because I'm extremely competitive too.

575
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:45,106
Just not really good enough
to back it up, usually, but I'm going.

576
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,983
I'm going. I'm gonna fight.

577
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:49,402
He hauls off and hits me in the chest

578
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:52,405
and I just haul off and hit him
right in the fucking eye.

579
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,533
And Phil just throws me out of practice.

580
00:33:56,617 --> 00:34:00,496
So I go down to the locker room
and Michael says,

581
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:02,748
"I know.

582
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:06,544
You know, I lost it for a second."

583
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:07,670
I'm in the shower and say,

584
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:10,089
"I just beat up the littlest guy
on the court,"

585
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,883
and I felt about this small.

586
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,553
So when I get in the car,
you know, I called...

587
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:19,140
Went back to the Berto Center and said,
"Please give me Steve Kerr's number."

588
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,017
I called Steve and I apologized.

589
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,227
"Look, man,
it had nothing to do with you."

590
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,563
You know, "I feel bad."

591
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:30,735
We talked it out
and it was probably, in a weird way,

592
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:35,573
the best thing that I ever did,
was stand up for myself with him,

593
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:40,161
because he tested everybody
he played with and I stood up to him.

594
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:43,956
He earned my respect
because he wasn't willing to back down

595
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,918
to be a pawn in this whole process.

596
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:51,422
From that point on,
our relationship dramatically improved,

597
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,591
and our trust in each other, everything.

598
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:55,843
It was like,
"All right, we got that out of the way.

599
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,095
We're going to war together."

600
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:02,642
And that season has to be the best team
I've ever been a part of.

601
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:06,229
Dennis Rodman had just arrived in Chicago.

602
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:07,814
Dominant defensive player.

603
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,942
He was a new character, but I knew Dennis,

604
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:13,236
and I knew what
he could do basketball-wise.

605
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:17,448
<i>♪ Step into a world ♪</i>

606
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:27,750
<i>♪ But the very best ♪</i>

607
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:31,087
That year, they were on it from the jump.

608
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,341
<i>Look out!</i>

609
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:37,760
<i>Rodman has restored
the rebounding presence</i>

610
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:40,513
<i>that disappeared when Horace Grant
left for Orlando.</i>

611
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:42,181
I loved it in Chicago.

612
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:43,181
I loved it.

613
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:45,644
Michael's Michael, Scottie's Scottie,
Dennis is Dennis.

614
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:46,727
So it was, like, great.

615
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:49,105
When we come together,
we feed off each other.

616
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:53,651
Michael can count on me and vice-versa.

617
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:56,112
<i>...blocked by
Dennis Rodman.</i>

618
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:57,363
<i>What a great play.</i>

619
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:03,327
<i>The Bulls rattled off
an amazing 23 wins in their first 25 games</i>

620
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:08,082
<i>and it became apparent this team
had a shot to be the greatest of all time.</i>

621
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:11,252
<i>The Bulls
have been superb.</i>

622
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,015
Everybody knew we were witnessing

623
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:15,464
the best season in NBA history
to that point.

624
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:16,757
<i>♪ I'm sorry, I lied ♪</i>

625
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:19,427
<i>♪ I'm number one, two, three
Four and five ♪</i>

626
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,262
<i>♪ Stop wastin' your money... ♪</i>

627
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:23,556
I'm sitting on a plane
with Steve and Scottie.

628
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:25,933
We're looking at the schedule
and Scottie's like,

629
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:30,354
"Hmm, wow, I don't think we're going to
lose a game for three months."

630
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,316
<i>The Bulls are trying
to break the record</i>

631
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:34,859
<i>for most wins in a single season.</i>

632
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:38,821
<i>The team they are trying to
beat for that is the '71-'72 Lakers team.</i>

633
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:42,283
<i>And that team had 69 wins
and 13 losses for the year.</i>

634
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:43,868
Well, if the Bulls win 70 tonight,

635
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:47,205
they go down in history
as possibly the best team of all time.

636
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:52,627
<i>There it is! Seventy has
become a reality for the Chicago Bulls.</i>

637
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:57,381
<i>The Chicago Bulls tonight
have made history.</i>

638
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:02,094
<i>The debate will now rage
about whether they are the best team ever.</i>

639
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:11,270
This year's Chicago Bulls squad

640
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:14,065
just may go down
as the greatest team of all time.

641
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:17,443
<i>The Bulls finished the season
with a record of 72 and 10,</i>

642
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:20,780
<i>but they said, "It don't mean a thing
without the ring."</i>

643
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:26,494
<i>This one's in the books.
Chicago goes to the second round.</i>

644
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:29,789
<i>Phil Jackson, the NBA Coach of the Year,</i>

645
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:33,000
<i>has his team in the
Eastern Conference Finals.</i>

646
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:36,921
If you know MJ, as I do very well,

647
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:39,799
only thing he was doing during the summer

648
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:43,427
is having Orlando Magic
on his mind. That's all.

649
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:48,891
<i>Today's game one
of the Eastern Conference Finals</i>

650
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:54,563
<i>is between the Orlando Magic
and your Chicago Bulls!</i>

651
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:56,816
They needed a rebounder.

652
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:59,193
They needed a defensive stopper.

653
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,237
<i>Rodman
with his ninth rebound.</i>

654
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,571
That's what Dennis did.

655
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:05,908
<i>Pass to Pippen.
Scottie Pippen goes all the way.</i>

656
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:08,703
We didn't have a chance.

657
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:11,789
<i>The Bulls
have swept the Magic.</i>

658
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:14,834
<i>Jordan finishes with 45 points.</i>

659
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:18,546
<i>The Bulls do it 106-101</i>

660
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:22,425
<i>as the Orlando Magic have been swept.</i>

661
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:25,511
Was it extra sweet
beating Orlando for you?

662
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:29,056
That had been a motivating thing
for you for over a year now.

663
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,267
Because of last year
and the number change,

664
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:35,021
and 45 didn't look like 23
and, you know, whatever, but...

665
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,857
we all were disappointed last year.

666
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:42,945
We came back to redeem ourselves as a unit
and I think we did that effectively.

667
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,914
<i>From the United Center
in Chicago, Illinois,</i>

668
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,834
<i>welcome to the 1996 NBA Finals.</i>

669
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:59,128
- Go Bulls! Number one!
- Yeah!

670
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:01,339
Bulls-Seattle program! Playoff program!

671
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:04,759
<i>Hi, everybody. I'm Bob Costas
and welcome to these NBA Finals</i>

672
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:09,764
<i>with due respect to Seattle SuperSonics
and apologies to their fans,</i>

673
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:13,392
<i>the prevailing attitude in Chicago,
and for most of the country really,</i>

674
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:19,273
<i>is that these NBA Finals loom not so much
as a competition, as a coronation.</i>

675
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:23,736
<i>This is viewed as the greatest mismatch
in NBA Finals history.</i>

676
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:32,453
That team was a good team.
They won 72 games.

677
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:36,290
But we was a pretty goddamn good team too.

678
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,293
And we had beat them
in the regular season.

679
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:40,878
During the regular season,

680
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:44,757
that '96 Seattle team had been
the best team in the Western Conference.

681
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:48,636
They had Gary Payton, a great point guard,
all-defensive player.

682
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,012
<i>Steal by Payton.</i>

683
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:52,640
<i>They call him The Glove,
he's such a good defender.</i>

684
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:55,601
He had a great
alley-oop partner in Shawn Kemp.

685
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:57,895
<i>He will go to get it
with the right hand!</i>

686
00:39:57,978 --> 00:40:00,398
They had a good coach
in George Karl.

687
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:02,358
- Let's go!
- Kick their ass

688
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:04,068
and be proud of what you've done.

689
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:06,088
- Now go out there and be big.
- Let's go.

690
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:08,989
- Go!
- Sonics!

691
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:17,081
During the Finals,
we go out to dinner one night.

692
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:20,084
George Karl's having dinner
on the other side.

693
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:22,128
"Hey, it's George Karl over there."

694
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:25,131
And George Karl does not come over
and speak to him.

695
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:26,882
He walked right past me.

696
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:30,886
I look at him, I say, "Really?
So that's how you're gonna play it."

697
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:34,557
He just kind of went by and I went,
"Uh-oh. Should have never done that."

698
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,016
I said, "That's a crock of shit."

699
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:40,396
We went to Carolina, we know Dean Smith,
I've seen him in the summer, we play golf.

700
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:41,939
"You gonna do this? Fine."

701
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:43,566
That's all I needed.

702
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:47,820
That's all I needed for him to do that
and it became personal with me.

703
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:51,490
<i>Jordan's being guarded
by Wingate.</i>

704
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:53,409
<i>Jordan...</i>

705
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:56,662
<i>Jordan... Yes!</i>

706
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:59,185
<i>That's just
an impossible matchup for Douglas.</i>

707
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:03,252
He's always finding some place
to find something to get him all fired up.

708
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:06,005
<i>Now Jordan going
against Payton.</i>

709
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:08,174
<i>Goes to the fadeaway.</i>

710
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:12,803
<i>He wanted that shot.
He wanted Gary Payton.</i>

711
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:15,973
<i>As soon as he had him one-on-one,
he waved everybody out of there...</i>

712
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:19,685
He used that
for every single game.

713
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:22,229
"I'm gonna show him.
He won't come and speak to me?"

714
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:26,233
<i>The Bulls over the Sonics 92-88.</i>

715
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:34,241
<i>Here is Jordan for three.</i>

716
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:39,330
<i>Game three, 108-86.</i>

717
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:44,210
The first three games, Mike ripped us.

718
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:46,670
Ripped a hole in us,
ripped a hole in our ass, really.

719
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:50,216
The Sonics lose the first three,

720
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:53,302
but George Karl didn't play his best card,

721
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:55,346
which was putting Payton on Jordan.

722
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:59,058
I had just won Defensive Player
of the Year, made All-League.

723
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:02,770
But me and George had a meeting.

724
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:05,147
He said, "I don't care
about your defense right now.

725
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:06,398
I know you can do that."

726
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:07,900
He said, "I need you to score."

727
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:11,987
So, he didn't want to sacrifice me
on both ends of the floor,

728
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:14,073
but we got down 3-0.

729
00:42:14,156 --> 00:42:15,074
I was mad.

730
00:42:15,075 --> 00:42:17,159
I said, "Fuck what
you're talking about, George.

731
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:18,702
I'm guarding, whatever you say."

732
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:20,913
I said, "You can't control this no more."

733
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:22,836
Lots of changes
for the SuperSonics.

734
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,792
Defensive Player of the Year Gary Payton

735
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:26,710
will start the game guarding Jordan.

736
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:30,047
That's the matchup many have
wanted to see this entire series.

737
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:32,591
Jordan is not like he used to be.

738
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:35,469
You know, he got a little aged,
he was off of basketball.

739
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:39,473
I think, uh, my best bet
is to really get him tired.

740
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,602
<i>The call against Chicago.</i>

741
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:47,648
<i>Offensive foul on Michael Jordan.</i>

742
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:50,359
Gary really got into him,
was talking shit to him too.

743
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:53,279
Gary did about as good a job
as you can expect guarding Michael.

744
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:55,197
<i>Fourth quarter.
Here is Jordan.</i>

745
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:59,368
<i>Whoa. It is one of those nights
for Michael.</i>

746
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:03,747
<i>He is now 6-for-19 from the field.</i>

747
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:06,792
<i>The Sonics will not be swept.</i>

748
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:09,878
<i>This will go to a fifth game.</i>

749
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:14,258
<i>Oh, Jordan beat badly
backdoor defensively.</i>

750
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:16,635
Everyone thought the Bulls
were gonna sweep.

751
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:20,139
The 72-10 season was going to be
capped off by a sweep in the Finals.

752
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:23,058
This was gonna be the greatest team.
The Sonics said, "Not so fast."

753
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:26,854
<i>Payton feeling it.
Nobody guarding, everybody backing off.</i>

754
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:28,314
<i>Not afraid at all.</i>

755
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:31,191
<i>And that'll do it.</i>

756
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:35,821
<i>The Sonics with an 89-78 win
over the Bulls.</i>

757
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:40,326
<i>It's been a complete
and remarkable turnaround for Seattle.</i>

758
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:43,579
<i>Gary Payton outplayed Michael Jordan
the last two games...</i>

759
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:46,165
A lot of people back down to Mike.

760
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:47,707
I didn't.

761
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:50,794
I made it a point.
I said, "Just tire him out.

762
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:54,173
Tire the fuck out of him.
You just gotta tire him out."

763
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:57,760
And I kept hittin' him and bangin' him
and hittin' him and bangin' him.

764
00:43:57,843 --> 00:43:59,136
<i>It took a toll on Mike.</i>

765
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:00,596
<i>It took a toll and then...</i>

766
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:02,222
<i>I feel so selfish.</i>

767
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:04,058
<i>...resting him a little bit.</i>

768
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:08,812
<i>And then, the series changed
and I wish I could've did it earlier.</i>

769
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:11,106
<i>I don't know if the outcome
would've been different,</i>

770
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:16,320
<i>but it was a difference...
and beating him down a little bit.</i>

771
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:19,572
The Glove.

772
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:23,077
I had no problem with The Glove.

773
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:27,122
I had no problem with Gary Payton.

774
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:29,667
I had a lot of other things on my mind.

775
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:38,133
<i>Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen,</i>

776
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:42,346
<i>and a Happy Father's Day
to dads all around the world.</i>

777
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:47,142
One of the main things I saw really
that affected him was Father's Day.

778
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:52,398
That championship game
was on Father's Day.

779
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:58,779
<i>The importance of his father
to him, it was huge.</i>

780
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:02,199
<i>James was always there in those moments.</i>

781
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:07,413
If you see some of the highlights
of Michael celebrating, where's his dad?

782
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:10,248
Right next to him.

783
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:12,000
His dad was always next to him

784
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:16,338
so a piece of Michael's heart
was missing.

785
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:23,655
<i>He thought back to when
he won his first championship</i>

786
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:25,439
<i>and he was crying
on the Larry O'Brien Trophy</i>

787
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:27,725
<i>and his father was right there
over his shoulder.</i>

788
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:29,393
<i>Now they're back in the Finals,</i>

789
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:32,229
<i>and his father wasn't there
to share it with him.</i>

pretty close to the vest

798

He was holding it together

<i>♪ You're stumbling into all ♪</i>

822
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:34,601
<i>♪ Stumbling into all ♪</i>

823
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:58,250
<i>We're just over 40 minutes
from the tip-off</i>

824
00:47:58,333 --> 00:48:01,336
<i>of the Eastern Conference Finals
between Indiana and Chicago.</i>

825
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:06,049
<i>Can the Pacers
end the Jordan era?</i>

826
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:10,429
<i>Such big-picture questions loom
as the Conference Finals begin in Chicago.</i>

827
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:15,142
<i>Could be another awe-inspiring exhibition,
could be the end of an era.</i>

828
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:18,645
<i>If the Jordan era
is going to end, and one day it will,</i>

829
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,649
<i>a loss to Indiana
in the Eastern Conference Final</i>

830
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:23,009
<i>in front of home folks
is not what the Bulls might consider</i>

831
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:24,693
<i>the most optimum way to wrap it up.</i>

832
00:48:25,193 --> 00:48:27,696
Gotta get out of the box quick.
Don't let them come in here...

833
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:39,458
Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome
once again to Bulls basketball,

834
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:43,086
playoff basketball, as we move
to the Eastern Conference Finals.

835
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:44,963
The Bulls and the Indiana Pacers.

836
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:50,427
We all looked at the Bulls
as the standard model of success.

837
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:56,475
They were considered the best
at that time, but we felt...

838
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:59,186
I feel to this day,
we were the better team.

839
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:03,440
The whole thing is, there was whispers

840
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:05,984
that this was going to be
Mike's last year.

841
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:09,696
So, I think a perfect storm was brewing...

842
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:15,035
and in my mind, I was thinking,
"All right, this is it.

843
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,287
You're going to retire Michael Jordan."
