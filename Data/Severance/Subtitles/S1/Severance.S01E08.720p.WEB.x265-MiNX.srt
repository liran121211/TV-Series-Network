1
00:00:44,671 --> 00:00:47,132
All right, Radar. Okay,
come on. Let's go.

2
00:05:25,118 --> 00:05:26,620
- Going good?
- Yep.

3
00:05:26,645 --> 00:05:27,729
Yeah?

4
00:05:29,664 --> 00:05:31,541
- Think you'll have it by...
- I'll get there.

5
00:05:54,147 --> 00:05:57,150
- She's not gonna make it, is she?
- You should be at your desks.

6
00:05:57,234 --> 00:05:59,694
We've both been done a
week. What is there to do?

7
00:05:59,778 --> 00:06:01,738
- Is she gonna make it?
- She's gonna make it.

8
00:06:01,821 --> 00:06:02,822
Mark.

9
00:06:02,906 --> 00:06:03,907
Yes?

10
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,243
- Don't laugh.
- At?

11
00:06:06,952 --> 00:06:10,288
I just wonder if it might be
helpful for us to stand behind her

12
00:06:10,372 --> 00:06:12,374
and perhaps chant her name.

13
00:06:15,293 --> 00:06:18,755
Okay. She'll make it.
Just let her focus.

14
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,058
How's she doing?

15
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,561
Gonna be down to the wire.

16
00:06:38,942 --> 00:06:40,235
She'll make it.

17
00:06:40,944 --> 00:06:43,113
Let's prep for
when she makes it.

18
00:06:48,451 --> 00:06:49,661
And I want to schedule

19
00:06:49,744 --> 00:06:52,789
a end-of-the-quarter
wellness session for Mark…

20
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:55,417
One last time.

21
00:06:57,961 --> 00:06:59,087
Really?

22
00:07:04,551 --> 00:07:05,552
Seth.

23
00:07:06,928 --> 00:07:09,598
I know that this has
been a trying quarter,

24
00:07:09,681 --> 00:07:11,850
and you have availed
yourself well.

25
00:07:14,144 --> 00:07:16,897
Mr. Graner sits with Kier now,

26
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:20,817
and I imagine they're both
very satisfied with you.

27
00:07:52,432 --> 00:07:53,808
Hey.

28
00:07:55,727 --> 00:07:56,728
Did you…

29
00:07:57,354 --> 00:07:58,438
I think I did.

30
00:08:13,495 --> 00:08:14,746
- She do it?
- She did it!

31
00:08:17,832 --> 00:08:19,084
Fuck and yes.

32
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:21,169
Oh, my goodness.

33
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,858
I knew you could do it, Helly R.

34
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,488
Even in your darkest moments,
I could see you arriving here.

35
00:08:50,198 --> 00:08:54,744
In refining your macrodata file, you have
brought glory to this company and to me.

36
00:08:55,537 --> 00:08:56,871
Kier Eagan.

37
00:08:57,372 --> 00:09:00,625
I... I love you.

38
00:09:01,751 --> 00:09:05,338
But now I must away, for there are
others who need me around the world.

39
00:09:06,256 --> 00:09:09,593
Goodbye, Helly
R., and thank you.

40
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:29,988
Boom! That's quota. We did it.

41
00:09:30,697 --> 00:09:31,698
Good work.

42
00:09:36,286 --> 00:09:37,370
So it's on now?

43
00:09:53,887 --> 00:09:56,723
Oh, Mark. I don't
know how you knew

44
00:09:56,806 --> 00:09:59,768
for the end of the quarter
I wanted a heart attack.

45
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:05,857
Well, we made it, despite
a staffing shake-up.

46
00:10:05,941 --> 00:10:10,111
Yes, and spending half of your
time farting around the halls.

47
00:10:10,195 --> 00:10:12,822
Still, yes. You made it.

48
00:10:12,906 --> 00:10:16,368
Have you decided who you want
to stay for the waffle party?

49
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,119
I was thinking Dylan.

50
00:10:21,623 --> 00:10:25,126
You know you can choose
yourself or anyone but Dylan.

51
00:10:25,961 --> 00:10:30,966
Yeah, but it's more his thing,
and he really worked hard.

52
00:10:37,097 --> 00:10:38,598
Well, I'll make
the arrangements.

53
00:10:39,182 --> 00:10:40,684
- Great.
- But before you celebrate,

54
00:10:41,601 --> 00:10:43,436
I'd like you to
drop by wellness.

55
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,521
Really?

56
00:10:44,604 --> 00:10:48,233
Yes. I'm having all department
heads do it end-of-quarter.

57
00:10:49,067 --> 00:10:53,572
With all of this stress and
Mr. Graner retiring and everything.

58
00:10:54,948 --> 00:10:55,949
Of course.

59
00:11:01,162 --> 00:11:03,290
Mark, all sarcasm aside…

60
00:11:04,207 --> 00:11:05,417
Yeah.

61
00:11:07,085 --> 00:11:08,128
Thank you.

62
00:11:10,297 --> 00:11:11,298
I...

63
00:11:11,965 --> 00:11:13,842
Lumon needed this.

64
00:11:26,855 --> 00:11:27,856
Mark.

65
00:11:29,024 --> 00:11:30,108
Ms. Casey.

66
00:11:38,617 --> 00:11:39,784
Where'd the tree go?

67
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:44,289
You can have a seat.

68
00:11:49,002 --> 00:11:50,503
Why's everything in boxes?

69
00:11:53,423 --> 00:11:56,593
Evidently Lumon's been blessed
with a new wellness director.

70
00:11:57,969 --> 00:12:01,014
So I'll be retiring at the conclusion
of this session, and the room is...

71
00:12:01,097 --> 00:12:02,265
What? Wait.

72
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,601
When did they tell you?

73
00:12:07,854 --> 00:12:10,565
Just now. Just a moment ago.

74
00:12:30,835 --> 00:12:31,878
Mark S.,

75
00:12:33,088 --> 00:12:37,008
you have successfully led your
department, Macrodata Refinement,

76
00:12:37,092 --> 00:12:38,760
to meet their quarterly quota,

77
00:12:39,553 --> 00:12:43,974
and are thus eligible for this
special, augmented wellness session.

78
00:12:44,057 --> 00:12:45,892
I didn't think you'd get fired.

79
00:12:49,479 --> 00:12:51,815
"Your outie is kind."

80
00:12:52,983 --> 00:12:58,238
Your outie has brightened
people's days by merely smiling.

81
00:12:59,155 --> 00:13:02,784
Your outie makes time
for people, even when...

82
00:13:02,867 --> 00:13:04,536
Hey, let me talk to somebody.

83
00:13:16,172 --> 00:13:19,384
I really liked being in the
office with you all that day.

84
00:13:22,387 --> 00:13:23,889
I know I vexed you.

85
00:13:24,556 --> 00:13:27,183
I know I'm… strange.

86
00:13:27,976 --> 00:13:30,312
No, you're not strange.

87
00:13:31,021 --> 00:13:33,648
My life has been 107 hours long.

88
00:13:34,482 --> 00:13:37,277
Most of that has been
these half-hour sessions.

89
00:13:39,362 --> 00:13:43,450
For me, my favorite
time was the eight hours

90
00:13:43,533 --> 00:13:47,370
I spent in your
department watching Helly.

91
00:13:50,165 --> 00:13:52,500
It's the longest
I've ever been awake.

92
00:13:56,338 --> 00:13:59,132
I suppose it's what you
could call my good old days.

93
00:14:04,346 --> 00:14:06,097
There must be
something we can do.

94
00:14:16,024 --> 00:14:18,318
Why do you care
what happens to me?

95
00:14:31,414 --> 00:14:34,793
Because we're people,
not parts of people.

96
00:14:36,002 --> 00:14:39,089
Even with what little they
gave us, these are our lives.

97
00:14:40,924 --> 00:14:43,009
No one gets to
just turn you off.

98
00:14:48,598 --> 00:14:49,933
You're nice, Mark.

99
00:15:07,242 --> 00:15:09,619
"Your outie is kind."

100
00:15:11,204 --> 00:15:16,084
Your outie can set up a
tent in under three minutes.

101
00:15:17,627 --> 00:15:22,007
Your outie knows a beautiful
rock from a plain one.

102
00:15:23,425 --> 00:15:25,719
Your outie likes giving...

103
00:15:27,012 --> 00:15:28,722
You know it's good, right?

104
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,850
That they don't
remember each other?

105
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,104
It means the chips work.

106
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:39,816
It's a win.

107
00:15:43,737 --> 00:15:45,405
Take her back down

108
00:15:46,948 --> 00:15:49,492
to the testing floor, please.

109
00:16:45,382 --> 00:16:48,552
Do you know if I'm
happy up there?

110
00:16:50,178 --> 00:16:51,179
Of course.

111
00:16:52,055 --> 00:16:54,516
You do all sorts of
wonderful things.

112
00:17:12,617 --> 00:17:14,285
- Could I just...
- I'm sorry.

113
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:16,912
I just have so much to do today.

114
00:17:17,706 --> 00:17:19,040
On you go.

115
00:17:58,747 --> 00:18:00,498
- Mark.
- Where were you?

116
00:18:00,582 --> 00:18:02,459
They gave me a wellness check.

117
00:18:03,251 --> 00:18:05,921
Okay. You're all set
for the waffle party.

118
00:18:06,546 --> 00:18:07,547
How's Ms. Casey?

119
00:18:07,631 --> 00:18:09,674
I mean, I'm over her, but
I still wanna be friends.

120
00:18:12,928 --> 00:18:14,471
- They fired her.
- What?

121
00:18:14,554 --> 00:18:15,639
Yeah. She just found out.

122
00:18:15,722 --> 00:18:18,058
Well, can we help her? Is
there anything we can do?

123
00:18:18,934 --> 00:18:20,060
I don't know.

124
00:18:22,103 --> 00:18:24,022
Is everyone sure
they wanna do this?

125
00:18:25,065 --> 00:18:27,567
Any Macrodats ready to party?

126
00:18:28,985 --> 00:18:29,986
Yeah.

127
00:18:33,448 --> 00:18:35,909
Dylan G.'s waffle party will
commence at close of day.

128
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,036
In the meantime,

129
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:41,873
I've ordered the pre-waffle party
egg bar social for everyone.

130
00:18:42,707 --> 00:18:45,835
Yes! Pay dirt! Yeah!

131
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,922
All of you deserve this
for reaching quota.

132
00:18:49,589 --> 00:18:51,216
But before we begin…

133
00:18:53,343 --> 00:18:57,597
A very special gift for
a very special Dylan.

134
00:18:58,473 --> 00:19:01,268
Our three-time R of the Q!

135
00:19:02,018 --> 00:19:04,896
A man whose mind is as
sharp as his incisors.

136
00:19:05,438 --> 00:19:06,481
Right, bud?

137
00:19:14,739 --> 00:19:15,782
Open it.

138
00:19:15,865 --> 00:19:19,536
Yeah, I bet you'd like that,
fuckers. But my prize, my eyes, so…

139
00:19:19,619 --> 00:19:21,371
Maybe you should
show them, Dylan.

140
00:19:21,871 --> 00:19:23,582
Show them what you requested.

141
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,293
Yeah, show us, man.

142
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:28,378
Fine.

143
00:19:41,683 --> 00:19:43,935
Okay, yeah. Let's switch
up the vibe in here.

144
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,401
Good?

145
00:20:13,757 --> 00:20:16,426
Jesus, this is actually good.

146
00:20:16,927 --> 00:20:19,221
Yeah, the egg bar
is coveted as fuck.

147
00:20:27,437 --> 00:20:29,356
Look at this thing over here.

148
00:20:29,439 --> 00:20:30,649
Looking good.

149
00:20:39,157 --> 00:20:40,992
I should be the
one to stay behind.

150
00:20:41,826 --> 00:20:42,869
Nope.

151
00:20:44,871 --> 00:20:46,581
Don't you wanna
see your kid again?

152
00:20:47,707 --> 00:20:50,043
What we're doing tonight
is just the first step.

153
00:20:54,214 --> 00:20:55,382
Are you sure?

154
00:21:23,827 --> 00:21:26,204
Helly R. Attempted
suicide three weeks ago.

155
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,708
Yes, she did.

156
00:21:32,419 --> 00:21:33,670
How could you not tell us?

157
00:21:36,089 --> 00:21:37,799
Did Milchick give you those?

158
00:21:39,926 --> 00:21:41,261
Answer the question.

159
00:21:43,346 --> 00:21:44,973
Am I speaking with the Board?

160
00:21:47,309 --> 00:21:49,352
We also know that you've
been spending time

161
00:21:49,436 --> 00:21:51,396
at the home of Mark
Scout's sister.

162
00:21:55,108 --> 00:21:56,109
Right.

163
00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:01,865
It has been decided that you be suspended
from your position, effective immediately.

164
00:22:03,742 --> 00:22:04,868
You are fired.

165
00:22:06,953 --> 00:22:08,204
Go...

166
00:22:10,874 --> 00:22:12,918
Oh, fuck off, Natalie!

167
00:22:14,502 --> 00:22:16,087
Is the Board even there?

168
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,553
Yes.

169
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:35,398
I'm sorry. That was rude.

170
00:22:36,858 --> 00:22:40,612
I can explain everything to
the Board tonight, please.

171
00:22:44,366 --> 00:22:45,992
The Board has
concluded the call.

172
00:23:22,445 --> 00:23:25,073
"Endow in each swing of your ax

173
00:23:25,156 --> 00:23:29,286
or swipe of your pen the
sum of your affections,

174
00:23:30,161 --> 00:23:33,248
that through me
they may be purified

175
00:23:34,332 --> 00:23:35,667
and returned.

176
00:23:39,504 --> 00:23:42,090
No higher purpose may
be found than this.

177
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:48,597
"Nor any… higher love."

178
00:24:18,168 --> 00:24:19,377
I figured it out.

179
00:24:20,295 --> 00:24:22,255
The goats lay the eggs.

180
00:24:22,339 --> 00:24:23,590
Oh, my God. You got it!

181
00:24:39,064 --> 00:24:40,357
You scared about tonight?

182
00:24:44,527 --> 00:24:45,528
Yeah.

183
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:51,451
I'm scared of getting caught.

184
00:24:55,705 --> 00:24:58,875
They left us unattended, and
thought we'd be too dumb to notice.

185
00:24:59,918 --> 00:25:01,503
They won't see this coming.

186
00:25:05,006 --> 00:25:06,466
Or we won't wake up.

187
00:25:17,477 --> 00:25:19,104
Or we're all assholes out there.

188
00:25:20,814 --> 00:25:22,232
Well, that's a given for me.

189
00:25:26,152 --> 00:25:30,532
You know, I just hope it turns
out I have things I care about.

190
00:25:31,575 --> 00:25:32,701
Like, for real.

191
00:25:35,787 --> 00:25:37,914
You pretended to care
about me pretty well.

192
00:25:43,712 --> 00:25:45,589
You're easy to
pretend to care about.

193
00:25:53,054 --> 00:25:54,055
Thank you.

194
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:57,851
As are you.

195
00:25:58,351 --> 00:25:59,352
Thanks.

196
00:26:03,023 --> 00:26:04,357
Okay, Refiners!

197
00:26:05,317 --> 00:26:08,028
I need to see about a management
issue, and this party is over.

198
00:26:09,946 --> 00:26:11,448
I'll leave the food.

199
00:26:11,531 --> 00:26:13,033
Thank you, Mr. Milchick.

200
00:26:13,116 --> 00:26:16,620
Dylan, I'll be back to escort
you to perpetuity shortly.

201
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,741
Key card.

202
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,508
On you go then.

203
00:27:34,531 --> 00:27:37,367
Okay, look, you don't mess
with any other departments.

204
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:38,910
- It's just us three.
- I know.

205
00:27:39,786 --> 00:27:41,556
The machine's designed
to be operated by two...

206
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,914
Two people. I'll be fine.

207
00:27:42,998 --> 00:27:44,332
Can I have the stuff, please?

208
00:27:51,506 --> 00:27:54,509
Now, look, it's likely we'll
all wake up around people.

209
00:27:54,593 --> 00:27:57,721
Could be driving or skiing,
whatever we do up there.

210
00:27:57,804 --> 00:27:59,973
So be ready for anything
as you go up the elevator.

211
00:28:00,056 --> 00:28:01,057
Okay?

212
00:28:01,641 --> 00:28:04,895
The important thing is you find
someone it seems you can trust,

213
00:28:04,978 --> 00:28:07,188
and you tell them everything.

214
00:28:07,272 --> 00:28:09,292
And we don't know how long
Dylan will be able to give us,

215
00:28:09,316 --> 00:28:11,526
so we can't get distracted
digging into our lives.

216
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:13,653
Right. The mission
is the priority.

217
00:28:20,619 --> 00:28:23,038
I probably should've
told you guys…

218
00:28:27,083 --> 00:28:29,502
But I kept this.

219
00:28:31,296 --> 00:28:33,632
And there was a
part of it that...

220
00:28:35,467 --> 00:28:36,676
Well…

221
00:28:42,766 --> 00:28:46,728
"Our job… is to taste free air."

222
00:28:48,521 --> 00:28:53,944
Your so-called boss may own the
clock that taunts you from the wall.

223
00:28:54,027 --> 00:28:56,738
- But, my..."
- "But, my friends, the hour is yours."

224
00:29:02,619 --> 00:29:04,246
Page 197 slaps.

225
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:21,846
Okay, kids.

226
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:27,519
Let's find out
what's for dinner.

227
00:29:34,442 --> 00:29:36,486
You think we're about
to meet our spouses?

228
00:29:37,779 --> 00:29:38,989
Maybe.

229
00:29:39,823 --> 00:29:40,991
Maybe it's each other.

230
00:29:42,117 --> 00:29:43,368
That'd be a hoot.

231
00:29:43,451 --> 00:29:44,536
Yeah.

232
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:49,833
Yeah, like, mid-argument
over car wash coupons.

233
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,460
"Honey, you're
cutting them wrong!"

234
00:30:00,135 --> 00:30:01,261
- Okay.
- All right.

235
00:30:26,202 --> 00:30:27,829
In case we don't come back.

236
00:30:29,164 --> 00:30:30,790
Or, I don't know, in case we do?

237
00:30:31,374 --> 00:30:32,375
Right.

238
00:30:39,716 --> 00:30:41,092
Good luck out there, boss.

239
00:31:11,706 --> 00:31:13,541
"Type. Trackball. Type. Flip.

240
00:31:13,625 --> 00:31:17,420
Trackball. Enter. Shift. Enter."

241
00:31:20,715 --> 00:31:21,800
Okay.

242
00:31:22,384 --> 00:31:24,594
Are you ready, Dylan G.?

243
00:31:28,265 --> 00:31:29,266
Dylan G.?

244
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:31,893
I'll be out in a minute!

245
00:31:31,977 --> 00:31:33,395
"Select, flip…."

246
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:36,791
Enjoy.

247
00:33:40,772 --> 00:33:44,109
Fuck her goddamn soul
forever into hell!

248
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:49,239
Filth and fucking fire
until she fucking dies!

249
00:33:50,115 --> 00:33:54,327
Fuck her and her
fucking fake smile!

250
00:33:55,161 --> 00:33:56,496
Oh, God.

251
00:33:57,622 --> 00:34:00,292
Fuck her goddamn soul!

252
00:36:10,463 --> 00:36:11,590
No.

253
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,187
Why?

254
00:37:32,504 --> 00:37:33,672
Mark.

255
00:37:35,048 --> 00:37:36,174
Hi, Mrs. Selvig.

256
00:37:36,258 --> 00:37:37,759
Sorry to just pop over…

257
00:37:37,842 --> 00:37:39,636
Yes? What is it?

258
00:37:40,845 --> 00:37:43,014
Well, I'm headed to
Devon and Ricken's.

259
00:37:43,098 --> 00:37:45,267
- They have that party tonight.
- And?

260
00:37:45,892 --> 00:37:50,480
Well, Devon asked me to double-check,
see if you're interested in coming.

261
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:57,737
I am sorry, Mark. I'm just... I'm not
feeling quite myself this evening.

262
00:37:58,321 --> 00:38:00,657
Oh, no. I get it.

263
00:38:01,157 --> 00:38:03,285
I mean, it's not
a funeral. So...

264
00:38:10,417 --> 00:38:12,752
You know, maybe I
could drive my own car.

265
00:38:14,921 --> 00:38:16,006
Yes!

266
00:38:16,089 --> 00:38:19,426
And that way I could leave if
I'm uncomfortable or afraid.

267
00:38:19,926 --> 00:38:21,678
Sure, yeah. That sounds great.

268
00:38:30,186 --> 00:38:31,313
Hey.

269
00:38:36,151 --> 00:38:37,319
Did you miss me?

270
00:39:19,361 --> 00:39:23,031
- The elusive Mark.
- Never thought of myself as elusive.

271
00:39:24,115 --> 00:39:25,700
Welcome. Welcome.

272
00:39:26,243 --> 00:39:30,580
Okay. The reading
starts in eight minutes.

273
00:39:31,164 --> 00:39:33,917
Mark, you've got your
copy to follow along, yes?

274
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,838
I... You know, I think
I left it by my bed.

275
00:39:40,382 --> 00:39:41,716
Shoot. Really?

276
00:39:42,384 --> 00:39:44,469
- Okay, shoot!
- Indeed. Yeah, I'm sorry.

277
00:39:44,553 --> 00:39:47,514
And it's a 15-minute drive back,
so you could still catch...

278
00:39:48,265 --> 00:39:49,724
You know what? It's fine.

279
00:39:49,808 --> 00:39:51,059
- Unless you want to.
- Well…

280
00:39:51,142 --> 00:39:52,394
My friends.

281
00:39:52,477 --> 00:39:53,728
- Hey.
- Hi.

282
00:39:53,812 --> 00:39:56,106
Baby's first party for Daddy.

283
00:39:56,189 --> 00:39:57,857
Look, she's so drunk.

284
00:39:57,941 --> 00:39:59,776
So there is so
much food in there.

285
00:39:59,859 --> 00:40:03,280
Rebeck! She may be willing
to share her copy with you.

286
00:40:03,363 --> 00:40:06,533
But I should ask her directly,
or she might be offended.

287
00:40:06,616 --> 00:40:08,243
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

288
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:11,037
- He is on it.
- I know.

289
00:40:12,038 --> 00:40:13,915
- Sister and brother.
- Alone at last.

290
00:40:13,999 --> 00:40:16,084
Gross. Hey, do you
wanna give me your coat?

291
00:40:17,794 --> 00:40:18,879
This is nice.

292
00:40:18,962 --> 00:40:20,088
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

293
00:40:20,839 --> 00:40:24,676
- You're a good wife and mother and stuff.
- Thanks.

294
00:40:24,759 --> 00:40:26,928
Oh, yeah. All glory unto Devon.

295
00:40:27,012 --> 00:40:29,097
Yeah, all glory, and screw you.

296
00:40:29,598 --> 00:40:31,850
- Hey, we should talk later.
- Yeah?

297
00:40:31,933 --> 00:40:35,687
Yeah. I've been pondering a
decently-sized life change.

298
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:36,813
Uh-oh.

299
00:40:36,897 --> 00:40:39,524
Well, I gotta float around and
host, but thank you for being here.

300
00:40:39,608 --> 00:40:41,048
- Yeah, of course. Yeah.
- Come here.

301
00:40:44,029 --> 00:40:45,488
Watch for leakies, Mark.

302
00:40:45,572 --> 00:40:47,407
Hi, Mrs. Selvig.

303
00:41:19,731 --> 00:41:21,358
But, Mark,

304
00:41:21,441 --> 00:41:24,444
I am sorry I was
so terse before.

305
00:41:24,527 --> 00:41:25,737
Oh, no, no, no.

306
00:41:27,739 --> 00:41:30,492
I just had a bad
day at the shop.

307
00:41:30,575 --> 00:41:34,788
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
But it's... Glad you're here now.

308
00:41:36,039 --> 00:41:37,207
Yeah.

309
00:41:38,458 --> 00:41:40,585
Work's just work, right?

310
00:41:45,465 --> 00:41:46,883
Yes.

311
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:24,421
Okay.

312
00:42:27,507 --> 00:42:32,804
Okay, "Trackball, track... Flip
timing switch. Type in. Trackball."

313
00:42:33,722 --> 00:42:35,765
Okay, so this is...

314
00:42:35,849 --> 00:42:38,226
Where's... Where's MDR?

315
00:42:39,936 --> 00:42:41,605
Shift.

316
00:42:45,525 --> 00:42:47,027
Manage.

317
00:42:48,153 --> 00:42:49,487
Confirm. Okay.

318
00:42:55,201 --> 00:42:56,328
That's...

319
00:43:00,957 --> 00:43:02,876
"Function." Boom.

320
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:09,883
Okay. Helly R.

321
00:43:13,595 --> 00:43:15,180
Come on. Come on. Come on.

322
00:43:15,889 --> 00:43:16,889
Mark.

323
00:43:19,643 --> 00:43:20,685
All right. Irving.

324
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,500
Fuck.

325
00:43:45,168 --> 00:43:46,378
Okay, "flip."

326
00:43:48,255 --> 00:43:50,549
Irving, Helly, Mark.

327
00:43:54,052 --> 00:43:55,372
Well, anyway, I
should probabl...

328
00:43:55,428 --> 00:43:57,556
- I don't mean to be nosy, but…
- No, no.

329
00:43:57,639 --> 00:44:01,643
…I heard you say to Devon
something about a life change?

330
00:44:05,272 --> 00:44:10,277
Well, I was gonna have a talk
with her about my job actually.

331
00:44:11,278 --> 00:44:12,404
At Lumon?

332
00:44:12,487 --> 00:44:13,488
Yeah.

333
00:44:14,281 --> 00:44:18,577
I was gonna tell her that
I'm thinking I might quit.

334
00:44:20,996 --> 00:44:21,997
Quit?

335
00:44:25,375 --> 00:44:26,626
"Beehive."

336
00:44:29,004 --> 00:44:31,298
"Lullaby, open house, overtime."

337
00:44:31,381 --> 00:44:32,507
Yes.

338
00:44:32,591 --> 00:44:34,092
Are you serious?

339
00:44:34,593 --> 00:44:36,136
Yeah. I just...

340
00:44:37,721 --> 00:44:39,556
This severance thing, it…

341
00:44:42,142 --> 00:44:43,810
Not sure I need it anymore.

342
00:44:56,990 --> 00:44:57,991
Okay.

343
00:44:59,659 --> 00:45:01,995
"Now find… A."

344
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:06,374
Great.

345
00:45:06,458 --> 00:45:07,751
Do it.

346
00:45:08,752 --> 00:45:10,003
Shit.

347
00:45:12,672 --> 00:45:14,007
Come on.

348
00:45:14,090 --> 00:45:17,510
Get away from them, Mark.

349
00:45:25,977 --> 00:45:27,270
Come here.
