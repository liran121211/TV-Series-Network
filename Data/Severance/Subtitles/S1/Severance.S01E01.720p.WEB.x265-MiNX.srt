1
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:15,307
Who are you?

2
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:27,152
Who are you?

3
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:50,717
Hello?

4
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,269
I'm sorry, I got ahead of myself.

5
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,313
Hi there, you on the table.

6
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,650
I wonder if you'd mind
taking a brief survey.

7
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:08,944
Who is that?

8
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:10,487
Five questions.

9
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:11,864
Now, I know you're sleepy,

10
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:15,325
but I just bet
it'll make you feel right as rain.

11
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:17,828
Who's speaking?

12
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:28,380
Oh, God.

13
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:40,517
Hey! Open the door!

14
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:50,694
I'd be just thrilled to chat
once we've run the survey.

15
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,030
Shall we begin with question one?

16
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:55,908
I'm not taking your survey.

17
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:59,328
Shall we begin with question one?

18
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:04,124
Let me out of here.

19
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,086
Hey!

20
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:12,174
Open the door!

21
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,134
Fuck.

22
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:18,096
Hey! Let me out!

23
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:42,246
Hey.

24
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,040
Hello.

25
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,167
Five questions?

26
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:49,753
Five questions.

27
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:52,339
What do I get at the end?

28
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:56,301
Depends on your answers.

29
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:00,764
Okay.

30
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,016
Great. Off we go.

31
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:06,019
Now to start, who are you?

32
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,522
That's the first question?

33
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,399
First name will do.

34
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:25,873
I don't...

35
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,417
It's okay.

36
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,545
If you can't answer the question,
feel free to say, "unknown."

37
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,089
What is this?

38
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:35,424
Okay, unknown.

39
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:39,761
Question two, in which US state
or territory were you born?

40
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:42,014
- Wait.
- Which state or territory, please?

41
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:44,183
- I don't know.
- Unknown.

42
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:48,437
Question three,
please name any US state or territory.

43
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,956
- Fuck. I...
- First that comes to mind.

44
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,858
- I don't know. Delaware. What is this?
- Delaware.

45
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:57,070
Question four,
what is Mr. Eagan's favorite breakfast?

46
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:58,864
I don't... That one makes no sense.

47
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:01,325
Right? Unknown. Question five.

48
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,994
And as a reminder,
this is the final question.

49
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,370
To the best of your memory,

50
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:09,416
what is or was the color
of your mother's eyes?

51
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,686
Okay, what's hap... What's happening?

52
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,146
Unknown.

53
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:37,110
So that's unknown,
unknown, Delaware, unknown, unknown.

54
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:39,905
What the hell did you do to me?

55
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,001
That's a perfect score.

56
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:51,495
Are you ready for Mr. Scout?

57
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,421
Thank you.

58
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,134
Go ahead.

59
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:32,929
Mr. Scout.

60
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,014
Hi, Judd.

61
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,528
- All right, see you this evening.
- Yep, see you soon.

62
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,886
- You're breathing shitty.
- Sorry.

63
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,137
You sick?

64
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:21,390
Maybe. Petey was sniffling yesterday.

65
00:11:21,974 --> 00:11:23,851
If you breathe on me,
I'll rip your larynx out.

66
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:26,353
Wow. That went right to ten.

67
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,647
I feel like
ripping out my germ-ridden larynx

68
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:31,358
would get you sicker
than just me breathing on you.

69
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:33,068
Nah. Endorphins.

70
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,781
Petey better not be out for the day,
'cause I'm about zero seconds

71
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:40,701
from wrapping the Tumwater file,
and he needs to process it.

72
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,369
I think he's out.

73
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:47,040
If he doesn't process today, they won't
know until Tuesday of next week.

74
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:49,751
- It's typical Lumon bullshit.
- Careful, guy.

75
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:52,129
Hi, kids. What's for dinner?

76
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,047
Goddamn it, Irv. We warned you.

77
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:55,716
About the greeting? You were kidding.

78
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:59,761
No, we sincerely hate it.
How many reasons did we come up with?

79
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,723
- Eight.
- Eight reasons.

80
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:05,267
Chief among them the
latent condescension.

81
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:08,854
And it's confusing. Like, did the kids
make you dinner in this scenario? Or...

82
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:10,939
Yeah. What kind of a shit dad are you?

83
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:14,526
- No Petey?
- We think he's sick.

84
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:17,446
Oh, no. And Dylan's
about to wrap Tumwater today.

85
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:19,072
Yeah, and if he doesn't see me finish,

86
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:21,158
I might get passed over
for refiner of the quarter

87
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,951
and miss out on my goddamn waffle party.

88
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:26,079
Grumble, grumble.
These perks are so out of hand.

89
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:28,081
When we'd process
a file in the old days,

90
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:29,965
they'd shake our hand
and fill up the creamer.

91
00:12:30,042 --> 00:12:32,377
I still don't buy
they actually incentivized creamer.

92
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:35,297
They did.
And back then, we were grateful for it.

93
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,049
That's fucked, dude.

94
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:38,759
Yes, very fucked.

95
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:43,388
To put in an honest day's work and not
get a children's breakfast in return.

96
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:45,766
Irv's got claws today.

97
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:49,269
Good morning, Macrodata Refinement.

98
00:12:49,353 --> 00:12:50,562
Hi, Mr. Milchick.

99
00:12:51,647 --> 00:12:53,315
Mark, could I have a word?

100
00:13:23,387 --> 00:13:26,557
Last time you saw Ms. Cobel,
she was in her old office.

101
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,100
Now she's in her new office.

102
00:13:28,684 --> 00:13:30,352
It's a completely different office.

103
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,354
What's this about?

104
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:33,897
She'd never say so,

105
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:36,817
but I know a compliment about the office
would just make her day.

106
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:50,247
Mark? Come in. Shut the thing.

107
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,291
Nice office.

108
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,042
It's horrid.

109
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:56,920
Yeah, the old one was better.

110
00:14:04,553 --> 00:14:06,847
You look awful. You look hungover.

111
00:14:08,182 --> 00:14:09,266
Have a seat.

112
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:17,024
The Board will be joining us
remotely today.

113
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:22,362
I have Mark S. at my desk.

114
00:14:32,748 --> 00:14:33,874
Hello. You...

115
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,215
I assume this is about me acting
as department chief today.

116
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:44,468
Okay. Well... I mean,

117
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:47,679
I've subbed for Petey before,
so it shouldn't be that big a thing.

118
00:14:47,763 --> 00:14:50,933
Petey is no longer with this company.

119
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:53,060
I'm sorry?

120
00:14:54,478 --> 00:14:59,900
I said,
Petey is no longer with this company.

121
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:04,279
I'm sorry, Mark. You guys were
one of my favorite office friendships.

122
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:10,077
I mean, there should have been
some notice of this. What happened?

123
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,286
We'd love to tell you,

124
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:14,331
but unfortunately,
non-disclosure policy forbids.

125
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:17,167
We'd be aiding an assault
on Petey's privacy by you.

126
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:25,133
Mark, would you place your key card
on my desk?

127
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:34,142
Mark S., at this time I confer upon you
the freedom to serve Kier

128
00:15:34,226 --> 00:15:37,896
in the advanced role of Macrodata
Refinement department chief.

129
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,231
Congratulations.

130
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:52,119
A handshake is available upon request.

131
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,085
Thank you. May I have a handshake?

132
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:11,054
I know you haven't run a training before,
but Irving will be there to shadow.

133
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:15,601
Just stick to the flowchart and escalate
properly depending on dialectics.

134
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:16,685
You'll be fine.

135
00:16:17,561 --> 00:16:19,921
- If you need to take a few minutes...
- Thank you. I don't.

136
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:26,653
And thank you to the Board as well.

137
00:16:28,447 --> 00:16:33,493
The Board won't be contributing
to this meeting vocally.

138
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:46,256
Our last refiner, who
was a woman, was...

139
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,883
Carol. Dylan's old seat.

140
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:52,012
Don't be sad.

141
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:54,723
I'm fine. We'll be fine.

142
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:56,683
I know you and Petey were close.

143
00:16:56,767 --> 00:17:00,103
He was the only one
who really appreciated your humor.

144
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:04,107
Everything's fine. So, I'm supposed
to start with just the input survey?

145
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:05,400
Isn't that a little weird?

146
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:06,527
It's standard.

147
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:09,946
Just start at 1A and continue by line,
based on her answers.

148
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,031
Well, what if I just talk to her?

149
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:15,661
She deserves to have the information
presented to her in the proper order.

150
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,162
Just as you had.

151
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:22,960
"If the trainee becomes agitated
and demands to leave, skip to page 19."

152
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:26,964
She has to ask three times
for you to let her.

153
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:28,924
Right. Yes.

154
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:35,639
Image is good.

155
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,058
She looks nice.

156
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:40,811
Okay. You're all set.

157
00:17:44,606 --> 00:17:46,942
I just love
seeing you all come in like this.

158
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:50,153
Go on ahead when you're ready.

159
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:55,367
- All right.
- Okay.

160
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,041
There you go.

161
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:07,004
Who are you?

162
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:17,598
All right.

163
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:21,018
Who are you?

164
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:27,941
- Mark.
- What?

165
00:18:28,025 --> 00:18:29,526
You skipped the preamble.

166
00:18:30,152 --> 00:18:31,153
Hello?

167
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:32,696
Shit!

168
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:38,827
I'm sorry, I got ahead of myself.

169
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:43,916
- That's it.
- Okay.

170
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,793
Hi there, you on the table.

171
00:18:46,877 --> 00:18:49,546
I wonder if you'd mind
taking a brief survey.

172
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:52,674
Who is that?

173
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:54,927
Five questions.

174
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,220
Now, I know you're sleepy,

175
00:18:56,303 --> 00:18:59,348
but I just bet
it'll make you feel right as rain.

176
00:19:01,058 --> 00:19:02,351
Who's speaking?

177
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:04,394
"Who's speaking?"

178
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:18,659
Hey! Open the door!

179
00:19:18,742 --> 00:19:20,035
Mark.

180
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:22,913
I'd be just thrilled to chat,
once we've run the survey.

181
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:24,265
Shall we begin with question one?

182
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:26,250
I'm not taking your survey.

183
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:31,922
Shall we begin with question one?

184
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:34,049
Let me out of here. Hey!

185
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:40,264
- Open the door!
- She's not supposed to do that.

186
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:41,849
Hey!

187
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:43,225
She's going to break in.

188
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:44,893
- Let me out!
- No, she's not.

189
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,479
Are you seeing this?

190
00:19:48,981 --> 00:19:49,982
I'm watching.

191
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:52,442
Should I help?

192
00:19:54,403 --> 00:19:55,445
You should not.

193
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,538
That's a perfect score.

194
00:20:05,998 --> 00:20:09,626
Now, I think I know where
our disconnect is coming from.

195
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:13,255
- What?
- Well, there was a preamble,

196
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:15,883
which I was supposed to read
before the survey,

197
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:18,510
to lead into the questions and...

198
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:22,222
But I unfortunately skipped that
and went straight into the survey.

199
00:20:22,306 --> 00:20:23,348
Am I livestock?

200
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:25,350
I'm sorry?

201
00:20:26,602 --> 00:20:30,522
Like, did you grow me as food
and that's why I have no memories?

202
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:38,197
You think we grew a full human,
gave you consciousness...

203
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,920
- I don't know.
- did your nails and...

204
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:41,200
I don't know. I don't know you.

205
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:43,493
No, you're not livestock. Good Lord.

206
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:45,579
Then what's my name?

207
00:20:47,122 --> 00:20:48,123
Helly.

208
00:20:48,624 --> 00:20:51,251
Your name is Helly. Helly R.

209
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:53,670
Please.

210
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:10,187
Thank you for taking the welcome survey.

211
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:14,274
I can sense that the questions
made you feel afraid or disoriented.

212
00:21:14,358 --> 00:21:18,695
Well, the good news is,
you're at an orientation.

213
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:27,955
You see, you have
been hired to a position

214
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:31,083
on the severed floor
of Lumon Industries.

215
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:32,835
The what floor?

216
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:48,559
I understand you're confused
about the severance procedure.

217
00:21:49,101 --> 00:21:50,853
Before we hop on that,

218
00:21:50,936 --> 00:21:55,607
let's chat about something I bet you
have heard of, the work/life balance.

219
00:21:56,567 --> 00:21:58,652
To start, imagine yourself as a seesaw.

220
00:22:01,238 --> 00:22:02,531
Fuck!

221
00:22:02,614 --> 00:22:04,700
That locks from out there!

222
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:06,159
- Let me out!
- God!

223
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:12,207
Can we just take a beat? Please.

224
00:22:24,303 --> 00:22:25,304
Please.

225
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:49,203
Okay, my name's Mark.

226
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:53,790
And... So, I...

227
00:22:53,874 --> 00:22:56,376
You know, few years back,
I woke up on this table.

228
00:22:57,002 --> 00:22:58,045
In this room.

229
00:22:58,128 --> 00:23:03,884
And a disembodied voice
asked me 19 times who I was.

230
00:23:07,012 --> 00:23:09,223
And when I realized I couldn't answer,

231
00:23:09,306 --> 00:23:14,728
I told that voice that I would find him
and kill him.

232
00:23:16,647 --> 00:23:19,566
I don't know why I said that.
I mean, I was scared too.

233
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:22,152
Did you kill the voice?

234
00:23:23,862 --> 00:23:24,863
No.

235
00:23:25,572 --> 00:23:30,118
No, that voice's name was Petey,
and he became my best friend.

236
00:23:32,204 --> 00:23:35,749
So, look, you know,
there is a life to be had here, Helly.

237
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:38,293
A life to be had?

238
00:23:47,344 --> 00:23:53,809
Well, you see,
life, like a seesaw, requi...

239
00:23:56,562 --> 00:23:58,313
Let me the fuck out of here!

240
00:24:07,948 --> 00:24:10,826
- Ask me again.
- What?

241
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:14,830
You've asked twice to be let go.
Ask one more time.

242
00:24:16,331 --> 00:24:17,875
- Mark.
- Yeah?

243
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:21,253
I would like to leave the building now.

244
00:24:23,672 --> 00:24:26,675
I understand you don't feel
it's working out for you here at Lumon.

245
00:24:26,758 --> 00:24:30,345
While disappointed, I'd hate to
keep you somewhere you're not happy.

246
00:24:30,429 --> 00:24:33,390
So, let's get you outta here.

247
00:24:39,855 --> 00:24:40,856
Irv.

248
00:25:03,629 --> 00:25:07,424
The departments are pretty spaced out,
but it'll all fill in one day.

249
00:25:07,508 --> 00:25:09,218
They're planning an expansion.

250
00:25:10,052 --> 00:25:11,637
And I'm, what, part of that?

251
00:25:12,471 --> 00:25:14,431
No. You're a replacement.

252
00:25:15,224 --> 00:25:16,517
Replacement for who?

253
00:25:18,393 --> 00:25:20,103
Why are you saying
that like you hate it?

254
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:29,696
Here's your stairwell.
Just past the bend.

255
00:25:36,995 --> 00:25:38,163
You're not coming with me?

256
00:25:38,247 --> 00:25:39,665
I'm not allowed to see.

257
00:25:39,748 --> 00:25:41,250
Excuse me?

258
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:42,751
Well, once you leave, you...

259
00:25:44,503 --> 00:25:45,838
I just can't watch you leave.

260
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:54,388
Of course you can't.

261
00:26:27,546 --> 00:26:29,590
What the hell?

262
00:27:21,892 --> 00:27:23,477
- Am I dead?
- No.

263
00:27:24,102 --> 00:27:26,480
- This isn't, like, hell or something?
- No.

264
00:27:27,648 --> 00:27:29,358
Then why the fuck can't I leave?

265
00:27:29,441 --> 00:27:32,236
Well, you did leave, just now.
Out into the stairwell at least.

266
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:34,696
You left, but you came back.

267
00:27:35,781 --> 00:27:37,366
- I did not.
- You did.

268
00:27:38,325 --> 00:27:39,326
Come on.

269
00:27:42,746 --> 00:27:45,666
Weaponizing office equipment
on your first day.

270
00:27:46,834 --> 00:27:49,127
You are gonna be fun.

271
00:27:49,837 --> 00:27:51,672
Look, I do sympathize.

272
00:27:51,755 --> 00:27:56,760
I've wanted to pummel Mark myself,
but I am his employer.

273
00:27:56,844 --> 00:27:58,887
And he is your department chief.

274
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,266
So we'll both have to be strong.

275
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:07,104
The good news is, there's only
one part left of your orientation,

276
00:28:07,187 --> 00:28:10,315
which Mark can't possibly derail.

277
00:28:11,108 --> 00:28:12,359
Why is that?

278
00:28:12,943 --> 00:28:14,862
Because it's a video.

279
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:24,538
Welcome to Lumon, Helly.

280
00:28:50,439 --> 00:28:51,732
Have a seat.

281
00:29:10,709 --> 00:29:12,085
Are you mad at me?

282
00:29:13,253 --> 00:29:17,633
For the incompetence
or the disobedience?

283
00:29:18,842 --> 00:29:20,677
- Well...
- Yes!

284
00:29:22,471 --> 00:29:24,848
You know, my mother was an atheist.

285
00:29:25,807 --> 00:29:29,186
She used to say that there was
good news and bad news about hell.

286
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:31,188
The good news is,

287
00:29:31,855 --> 00:29:36,693
hell is just the product
of a morbid human imagination.

288
00:29:36,777 --> 00:29:37,778
The bad news is,

289
00:29:39,363 --> 00:29:43,283
whatever humans can imagine,
they can usually create.

290
00:29:47,621 --> 00:29:49,164
I don't know what that means.

291
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:54,628
A department like yours
can go so good or so bad.

292
00:29:55,379 --> 00:29:57,297
You know what makes the difference?

293
00:30:04,179 --> 00:30:05,180
The people.

294
00:30:16,692 --> 00:30:17,985
You can have a seat.

295
00:30:31,915 --> 00:30:34,543
Okay, go ahead and have a seat.

296
00:30:44,344 --> 00:30:45,429
My name is Helly R.

297
00:30:47,764 --> 00:30:48,932
I'm making this video

298
00:30:49,016 --> 00:30:53,187
roughly two hours
before it will be shown to me.

299
00:30:55,147 --> 00:30:58,483
I have, of my own free accord,
elected to undergo the procedure

300
00:30:58,567 --> 00:31:00,485
colloquially known as severance.

301
00:31:02,321 --> 00:31:07,409
I give consent for my perceptual
chronologies to be surgically split,

302
00:31:07,492 --> 00:31:11,663
separating my memories between
my work life and my personal life.

303
00:31:12,623 --> 00:31:13,957
I acknowledge that, henceforth,

304
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:18,128
my access to my memories
will be spatially dictated.

305
00:31:19,421 --> 00:31:21,965
I will be unable to access
outside recollections

306
00:31:22,049 --> 00:31:24,968
whilst on Lumon's
severed basement floor,

307
00:31:25,052 --> 00:31:27,513
nor retain work memories upon my ascent.

308
00:31:29,932 --> 00:31:33,185
I am aware that this alteration

309
00:31:33,268 --> 00:31:36,188
is comprehensive and irreversible.

310
00:31:37,773 --> 00:31:39,441
I make these statements freely.

311
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:47,699
Okay, that's a wrap.

312
00:31:54,831 --> 00:31:55,832
Okay.

313
00:31:56,917 --> 00:31:57,918
Go ahead.

314
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:18,272
So I'll never leave here?

315
00:32:20,524 --> 00:32:21,817
You'll leave at 5:00.

316
00:32:22,317 --> 00:32:25,487
Well, actually,
they stagger our exits, so 5:15.

317
00:32:26,697 --> 00:32:29,867
But it won't feel like it.
Not to this version of you anyway.

318
00:32:31,577 --> 00:32:32,911
Do I have a family?

319
00:32:33,954 --> 00:32:35,289
You'll never know.

320
00:32:36,874 --> 00:32:38,584
And I have no choice.

321
00:32:39,751 --> 00:32:45,007
Well, every time you find yourself here,
it's because you chose to come back.

322
00:33:13,076 --> 00:33:14,077
Hello.

323
00:33:52,199 --> 00:33:53,325
Good night.

324
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:54,409
Good night.

325
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:46,043
"Dear Mark,
Whilst carrying boxes in a room today,

326
00:34:46,128 --> 00:34:48,505
you slipped on an
overhead projector slide

327
00:34:48,589 --> 00:34:52,176
and sustained a minor
blow to the temple."

328
00:35:20,287 --> 00:35:21,496
Hey!

329
00:35:22,164 --> 00:35:23,749
Sorry.

330
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:26,960
Maybe keep your eyes on the icy road.

331
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:30,839
Sorry.

332
00:36:30,566 --> 00:36:34,570
Indeed, this gnat will spend
much of its three to seven-day life...

333
00:36:52,504 --> 00:36:56,925
No, I know, Mrs. Selvig.
It's just, it was in my space again.

334
00:36:57,759 --> 00:37:01,513
Yeah. Well, trash comes tomorrow night.
Tonight's recycling.

335
00:37:02,514 --> 00:37:05,642
Yeah, it is weird,
but that's how they do it.

336
00:37:05,726 --> 00:37:08,061
And with both yours,
there's no room for...

337
00:37:25,746 --> 00:37:26,997
- Hey.
- Hey.

338
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:32,211
Did you forget?

339
00:37:37,174 --> 00:37:38,759
Oh, yeah. Shit.

340
00:37:38,842 --> 00:37:39,843
That's okay.

341
00:37:40,844 --> 00:37:41,845
- Sorry.
- That's fine.

342
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:44,640
- Do you wanna put on pants, and I'll...
- I'm wearing pants.

343
00:37:44,723 --> 00:37:46,517
meet you in... Those are not pants.

344
00:37:47,893 --> 00:37:51,730
So if there's no
dinner, how is it dinner?

345
00:37:51,813 --> 00:37:52,940
- Okay.
- Like...

346
00:37:53,649 --> 00:37:55,317
You actually owe me this.

347
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,944
- Do I?
- Yep.

348
00:37:57,027 --> 00:38:00,322
You remember that time when we were kids
and I was a way better sibling than you?

349
00:38:00,822 --> 00:38:02,866
Must have slipped my mind.

350
00:38:04,326 --> 00:38:06,745
Also,
I know we're nearing the anniversary,

351
00:38:06,828 --> 00:38:08,908
so I just thought
maybe you'd wanna be around people.

352
00:38:10,123 --> 00:38:11,124
Nope.

353
00:38:13,168 --> 00:38:15,462
This is nice. When did you get it?

354
00:38:15,546 --> 00:38:17,756
Something from work,
and they apologized.

355
00:38:18,382 --> 00:38:19,800
They apologized. Thank God.

356
00:38:20,843 --> 00:38:22,761
Did they tack an explanation
onto that apology?

357
00:38:22,845 --> 00:38:25,180
It's fine. Got a gift card.

358
00:38:25,764 --> 00:38:28,475
You got a gift card.
Where's he going to?

359
00:38:29,518 --> 00:38:30,644
I don't know. Pip's.

360
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:34,147
Of course it's Pip's. Well, enjoy.

361
00:38:34,231 --> 00:38:36,024
I will, without you.

362
00:38:45,284 --> 00:38:46,743
There's our captive.

363
00:38:46,827 --> 00:38:49,246
- Hi, Rick.
- Ricken. Come on, it's Ricken.

364
00:38:50,497 --> 00:38:52,416
- You, sir, look at peace.
- You know.

365
00:38:53,125 --> 00:38:54,334
- Okay.
- Hi, baby.

366
00:38:54,418 --> 00:38:55,419
Hi.

367
00:38:56,170 --> 00:39:00,757
No, what a lot of people overlook,
I think, is that life is not food.

368
00:39:00,841 --> 00:39:02,551
- Right.
- You've got life,

369
00:39:02,634 --> 00:39:06,054
this complex quality
of sentience and activity.

370
00:39:06,138 --> 00:39:08,932
And then you've got food, which is what?

371
00:39:09,016 --> 00:39:10,392
- Yes, what is it?
- Fuel.

372
00:39:11,018 --> 00:39:13,353
Calories. It's not the same thing.

373
00:39:13,437 --> 00:39:15,814
- Yes, that is spot on, Patton.
- I definitely agree.

374
00:39:15,898 --> 00:39:17,566
Though, if I'm...

375
00:39:17,649 --> 00:39:22,863
Sorry, Mark and my dad used to have
"whiskey is life" carved on a flask.

376
00:39:24,448 --> 00:39:26,325
- True.
- It was low-hanging fruit.

377
00:39:26,408 --> 00:39:28,785
He did. He was a misdiagnosed alcoholic.

378
00:39:28,869 --> 00:39:32,247
Now, Mark, Ricken told Rebeck and me
that you're a former history professor.

379
00:39:32,331 --> 00:39:33,332
Yeah.

380
00:39:33,415 --> 00:39:35,792
So I'm curious
for your take on all of this.

381
00:39:37,211 --> 00:39:39,213
The food v life of it.

382
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:44,885
Well, I'm not sure.
I taught mostly about World War I.

383
00:39:44,968 --> 00:39:47,095
Okay. Well, I got one for you.

384
00:39:47,179 --> 00:39:48,931
I was just reading this think piece

385
00:39:49,014 --> 00:39:52,768
about the comparative levels of violence
and warfare throughout history.

386
00:39:53,393 --> 00:39:54,394
Nerd alert.

387
00:39:54,478 --> 00:39:55,896
War porn, I know.

388
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:02,444
But anyway, in it, he said that the
people actually called it the Great War.

389
00:40:03,028 --> 00:40:05,868
Apparently, it would have been a
faux pas to have called it World War I.

390
00:40:06,281 --> 00:40:07,616
Is that right?

391
00:40:11,411 --> 00:40:16,792
Well, you know,
no one would've called it World War I

392
00:40:16,875 --> 00:40:20,212
'cause World War II hadn't happened yet.

393
00:40:21,463 --> 00:40:23,090
- Wow.
- Of course.

394
00:40:23,173 --> 00:40:24,591
- That's absolutely right.
- Duh.

395
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,343
That's so true.

396
00:40:26,426 --> 00:40:27,970
This is why we bring this guy.

397
00:40:28,929 --> 00:40:32,516
Mark's late wife, Gemma, was an educator
as well. Russian literature.

398
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:34,518
- I love literature.
- Right?

399
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:37,688
But Mark is a Lumon man now.

400
00:40:37,771 --> 00:40:39,106
- Ricken.
- Really?

401
00:40:39,189 --> 00:40:41,066
Yeah. About two years.

402
00:40:41,149 --> 00:40:43,110
- Do you design the medicines?
- No.

403
00:40:43,193 --> 00:40:45,863
I thought Lumon
was more on the tech side of things.

404
00:40:45,946 --> 00:40:47,739
- They began in the 1800s.
- Really?

405
00:40:47,823 --> 00:40:49,616
Topical salves, right?

406
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:50,784
What don't they make?

407
00:40:51,743 --> 00:40:54,454
Yeah, but I'm in
the corporate archives division, so...

408
00:40:54,538 --> 00:40:56,790
So you know all the dirty secrets.

409
00:40:57,332 --> 00:40:59,126
- No, not really.
- No.

410
00:40:59,209 --> 00:41:03,338
Mark's work is sensitive enough
as to require the severance procedure.

411
00:41:07,843 --> 00:41:08,844
Well.

412
00:41:10,762 --> 00:41:12,264
That's something, isn't it?

413
00:41:14,016 --> 00:41:17,311
Yeah. It's also, I think, something
that's his choice to tell people or not.

414
00:41:17,394 --> 00:41:18,854
- Right, Ricken?
- Oh, my God.

415
00:41:18,937 --> 00:41:20,814
- No. No.
- Oh, God, Mark.

416
00:41:20,898 --> 00:41:22,625
- Please forgive me.
- No. It's okay. I don't care.

417
00:41:22,649 --> 00:41:25,694
- My apologies.
- No, I think it's fascinating.

418
00:41:25,777 --> 00:41:27,446
I mean, I wish I could do it.

419
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:31,909
I'd just always be thinking about,
you know, the other one.

420
00:41:34,786 --> 00:41:37,748
Well, there is no other one.

421
00:41:38,624 --> 00:41:40,709
It's me. I do the job.

422
00:41:40,792 --> 00:41:44,922
I just don't grasp the visceral element.
What does it feel like?

423
00:41:48,175 --> 00:41:51,553
Well, it's simple.
One's memories are bifurcated,

424
00:41:51,637 --> 00:41:54,973
so when you're not at work, you have no
recollection of what it is you do there.

425
00:41:55,057 --> 00:41:56,117
Did I get that right, Mark?

426
00:41:56,141 --> 00:41:58,936
- Well, it's...
- So you walk in at 9:00 a.m.,

427
00:41:59,019 --> 00:42:01,605
and then suddenly it's 5:00,
and you're leaving?

428
00:42:01,688 --> 00:42:04,233
- Well, they stagger us a little, so...
- They stagger you?

429
00:42:04,316 --> 00:42:07,569
And then, conversely, when you're at
work, you can't access outside memories.

430
00:42:07,653 --> 00:42:11,323
So, in effect,
that version of you is trapped there.

431
00:42:11,406 --> 00:42:13,575
Well...

432
00:42:13,659 --> 00:42:16,203
- Well, I mean, not trapped, but...
- But what?

433
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:24,253
No, no. I'm curious. What were you
gonna say? But not trapped, but what?

434
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:28,131
What were you saying?

435
00:42:32,261 --> 00:42:35,055
So I suppose we know where you fall
on the congressional goings-on.

436
00:42:35,138 --> 00:42:36,431
Okay, I think we may be

437
00:42:36,515 --> 00:42:37,795
- missing the point here.
- Yeah.

438
00:42:39,309 --> 00:42:41,979
The point is that Mark made a decision.

439
00:42:42,062 --> 00:42:43,814
And that decision was controversial,

440
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:47,150
ethically and socially.

441
00:42:47,734 --> 00:42:50,487
Morally. Scientifically.

442
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:54,950
But, Mark, I stand behind you

443
00:42:55,576 --> 00:42:56,785
without reservation.

444
00:42:56,869 --> 00:42:58,495
- So well said.
- Thank you.

445
00:42:58,579 --> 00:43:00,998
- Absolutely.
- I definitely stand behind Mark.

446
00:43:02,124 --> 00:43:03,125
Wow.

447
00:43:04,751 --> 00:43:07,087
Thank you. That's very sweet.

448
00:43:07,963 --> 00:43:10,382
Well, we're at the point
where, traditionally,

449
00:43:10,465 --> 00:43:12,509
I would say something like, "Dig in."

450
00:43:13,886 --> 00:43:16,471
But I must say,
I do think that the lack of food

451
00:43:16,555 --> 00:43:21,101
has allowed us to already do so
on a much deeper level.

452
00:43:21,185 --> 00:43:23,020
- Oh, yeah. No, absolutely.
- Right?

453
00:43:23,103 --> 00:43:26,023
I was saying, my friend in Lima hasn't
had a food-based dinner event in...

454
00:43:27,608 --> 00:43:30,277
If I give you $3,000,
will you forgive me?

455
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:36,491
Well, because your child
is innocent of tonight's atrocities,

456
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:40,037
I'll wait until after it's born
to murder you.

457
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:43,540
Oh, my God. Here you go, buddy.

458
00:43:46,585 --> 00:43:47,586
Thank you.

459
00:43:52,508 --> 00:43:56,595
Hey, how's the good doctor therapy man
with that weird little mustache?

460
00:44:01,517 --> 00:44:02,518
You're not going?

461
00:44:04,353 --> 00:44:06,813
Well, the work thing's helped.

462
00:44:08,148 --> 00:44:09,149
Yeah.

463
00:44:10,734 --> 00:44:13,529
I'm proud of you for taking that job.
I really am.

464
00:44:14,738 --> 00:44:17,098
And I think she would've been too.
I know she would've been.

465
00:44:20,327 --> 00:44:23,872
I just feel like forgetting about her
for eight hours a day

466
00:44:23,956 --> 00:44:26,792
isn't the same thing as healing.

467
00:44:34,842 --> 00:44:36,722
You wanna crash here,
since you're already here?

468
00:44:38,178 --> 00:44:39,179
No.

469
00:44:40,347 --> 00:44:41,348
Why?

470
00:44:41,431 --> 00:44:43,267
Your house smells like pregnancy.

471
00:44:47,062 --> 00:44:49,273
Yeah, I'm just not grasping
the visceral element of it.

472
00:44:51,108 --> 00:44:52,526
She is fun, wasn't she?

473
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:55,904
- You're definitely staying here tonight.
- No, I'm not.

474
00:44:55,988 --> 00:44:57,906
I'm making all the bedsheets myself,

475
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:01,034
so I won't finish with the big one
for some time.

476
00:45:01,785 --> 00:45:04,288
But the twin is comfortable,

477
00:45:04,371 --> 00:45:07,124
and the pajamas were made
on a Baltic handloom,

478
00:45:07,207 --> 00:45:09,585
so you'll sleep well.

479
00:45:10,127 --> 00:45:14,256
Thanks.
I still don't quite get the three beds.

480
00:45:14,339 --> 00:45:16,341
- Right.
- Ricken's colleague told us

481
00:45:16,425 --> 00:45:20,262
that switching out the beds
as the child grows can wound that child.

482
00:45:20,345 --> 00:45:21,722
Irreparably.

483
00:45:21,805 --> 00:45:26,018
But if you provide said child
with all of its beds upon birth,

484
00:45:26,101 --> 00:45:29,146
you allow it to progress across the room
at its own rate.

485
00:45:29,771 --> 00:45:31,356
Got it. Yeah.

486
00:45:36,486 --> 00:45:37,487
Yeah.

487
00:45:38,572 --> 00:45:40,574
I think people really
enjoyed you tonight, Mark.

488
00:45:42,826 --> 00:45:43,827
Good.

489
00:45:44,328 --> 00:45:45,537
All right, baby.

490
00:45:46,663 --> 00:45:47,748
- You ready, baby?
- Yeah.

491
00:45:47,831 --> 00:45:48,916
- Let's go.
- Sweet dreams.

492
00:45:48,999 --> 00:45:50,000
Thanks.

493
00:45:51,543 --> 00:45:53,045
Good night, milord.

494
00:45:53,128 --> 00:45:54,546
Good night, milady.

495
00:47:51,955 --> 00:47:52,956
Hey.

496
00:47:53,457 --> 00:47:54,458
Hey.

497
00:47:54,958 --> 00:47:55,959
How long you been up?

498
00:47:56,543 --> 00:47:57,669
A while.

499
00:48:00,923 --> 00:48:04,468
There was a businessman
in the yard last night.

500
00:48:04,551 --> 00:48:06,220
- A businessman?
- Yeah.

501
00:48:06,303 --> 00:48:08,222
Entry-level or management?

502
00:48:08,305 --> 00:48:09,306
I'm serious.

503
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:11,659
There was seriously a man
in my yard last night?

504
00:48:11,683 --> 00:48:12,935
Yeah.

505
00:48:13,519 --> 00:48:14,520
Holy shit.

506
00:48:15,646 --> 00:48:18,482
He, you know, looked at me weird,
like he knew me.

507
00:48:19,024 --> 00:48:21,610
Did the prowler invading my home
make you feel seen?

508
00:48:21,693 --> 00:48:22,945
So seen.

509
00:48:24,488 --> 00:48:27,282
Well, there's a bar down the hill.
It's probably just a stumbler.

510
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,911
Speaking of which,
you still smell like a distillery.

511
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:35,332
I'm sorry,
I just had to drown out the memory

512
00:48:35,415 --> 00:48:38,627
of Mom and Dad switching out my beds
when we were kids.

513
00:48:39,211 --> 00:48:41,004
You've been sitting on that one.

514
00:49:32,514 --> 00:49:33,515
Hello.

515
00:49:35,058 --> 00:49:40,022
Okay. So, recycling was
last night, Mrs. Selvig.

516
00:49:40,105 --> 00:49:41,398
Tonight's garbage.

517
00:49:41,481 --> 00:49:45,152
And you keep putting
your bin on my side. So...

518
00:49:47,154 --> 00:49:48,655
Yeah. Okay.

519
00:49:49,907 --> 00:49:53,202
You know, I actually can't talk
right now. I'm out at dinner. But...

520
00:49:54,786 --> 00:49:56,288
No, by myself.

521
00:49:59,041 --> 00:50:01,502
Pip's Bar and Grille.

522
00:50:02,544 --> 00:50:03,629
Excuse me.

523
00:50:05,214 --> 00:50:07,424
Hang up. Quickly.

524
00:50:12,513 --> 00:50:15,724
I'm sorry, Mrs. Selvig.
They've cooked the food, and it's here.

525
00:50:18,018 --> 00:50:20,938
Hi, kids. What's for dinner?

526
00:50:26,026 --> 00:50:28,820
I'm sorry. You don't get that reference.

527
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,700
Are you following me?

528
00:50:34,701 --> 00:50:36,245
Your voice is different here.

529
00:50:37,204 --> 00:50:38,288
Worse.

530
00:50:40,374 --> 00:50:42,918
- Okay, who the fuck are you?
- Petey.

531
00:50:43,001 --> 00:50:45,337
My name is Petey. I'm from work.

532
00:50:47,631 --> 00:50:51,510
Well, that's not plausible.
Everyone in my department is...

533
00:50:51,593 --> 00:50:54,513
Severed. Severed. I was.

534
00:50:56,390 --> 00:50:58,559
Okay. Well, severance
is pretty permanent.

535
00:50:58,642 --> 00:51:02,312
Yeah. Bypassing the implant wasn't easy.
I had help.

536
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:18,120
So, what, you were unhappy at work?

537
00:51:18,203 --> 00:51:20,789
- And instead of lodging a complaint, you...
- No.

538
00:51:21,498 --> 00:51:24,585
I tried that first. So did you.

539
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:29,506
Right. Okay. So...

540
00:51:30,966 --> 00:51:32,426
You've unsevered.

541
00:51:32,509 --> 00:51:37,306
And now you, what, think they're
after you or something?

542
00:51:41,101 --> 00:51:42,102
Yeah.

543
00:51:45,439 --> 00:51:49,610
"They" being Graner,
who's probably out here right now.

544
00:51:49,693 --> 00:51:54,323
Graner. Okay.
Is that, like, a person you know or...

545
00:51:54,406 --> 00:51:57,701
We both know him. We don't like him.

546
00:51:59,286 --> 00:52:00,287
I see.

547
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:10,506
Nothing down there is what they say.

548
00:52:12,049 --> 00:52:13,759
If something happens to me,

549
00:52:14,718 --> 00:52:18,180
the things I know need to stay known.

550
00:52:20,682 --> 00:52:22,559
I'd prefer it be by a friend.

551
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:30,692
So, we're friends?

552
00:52:32,194 --> 00:52:33,570
I'm your best friend.

553
00:52:35,239 --> 00:52:36,740
You're my very good friend.

554
00:53:12,109 --> 00:53:14,820
Mark, sorry about the card.

555
00:53:15,863 --> 00:53:18,198
I had to grab something,
and I know it's not appropriate.

556
00:53:18,282 --> 00:53:21,493
Though I'm sure you'd be
a really fucking awesome niece.

557
00:53:23,745 --> 00:53:27,291
We used to wonder
what kind of men we were on the outside,

558
00:53:27,916 --> 00:53:30,627
what choices we had made and why.

559
00:53:37,384 --> 00:53:39,344
I used to think it would take a monster

560
00:53:39,428 --> 00:53:41,805
to put someone
in a place like that office.

561
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:46,143
Especially if the person was himself.

562
00:53:49,146 --> 00:53:52,941
But we're not monsters, Mark.
Not real ones.

563
00:53:55,694 --> 00:53:59,740
If you don't wanna know what's
going on down there, I won't force it.

564
00:54:02,326 --> 00:54:06,330
But if you do, there's an address
on the back of this card.

565
00:54:08,332 --> 00:54:13,128
Go alone, and you'll find
the beginning of a very long answer.

566
00:54:34,733 --> 00:54:37,069
Mark, is that you?

567
00:54:37,152 --> 00:54:38,445
Hi, Mrs. Selvig.

568
00:54:39,905 --> 00:54:44,201
Will you color me embarrassed
for the mix-up with the bins?

569
00:54:44,284 --> 00:54:45,577
No, it's no problem.

570
00:54:46,787 --> 00:54:47,788
How was dinner?

571
00:54:48,789 --> 00:54:51,750
Fine. I'm just, you know, tired.

572
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:56,004
You know, my mother was a Catholic.

573
00:54:56,088 --> 00:55:01,802
She used to say it takes the saints
eight hours to bless a sleeping child.

574
00:55:02,678 --> 00:55:05,055
I hope you aren't rushing the saints.

575
00:55:06,139 --> 00:55:09,560
Well, I'll give them ample time tonight.

576
00:55:11,144 --> 00:55:12,646
Good night, Mrs. Selvig.

577
00:55:12,729 --> 00:55:13,730
Mark.

578
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:18,610
You're good people.
