1
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:15,950
<i>Devon! Devon!</i>

2
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:19,662
<i>No, no, no.
Listen, we're not happy, we're miserable.</i>

3
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:20,938
Burt!

4
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:24,209
- They torture us down there!
<i>- Devon!</i>

5
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:25,502
<i>We're prisoners!</i>

6
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:26,920
<i>Burt!</i>

7
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:28,111
She's alive!

8
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:37,222
- Yeah. Okay.
- Mmm. Okay.

9
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:39,224
Mark?
Here. Will you take her for a second?

10
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:41,434
- It's okay. I got her. Yeah.
- Be careful with her.

11
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,978
- Don't go far though.
- Mm-hmm. I won't.

12
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,087
Mark.

13
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:50,676
So, this is you now?

14
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:52,987
Yeah.

15
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,096
Are you okay?

16
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:55,722
Yeah.

17
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:58,433
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

18
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:01,645
What's my name?

19
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:05,858
Persephone.

20
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:08,235
Can you spell that?

21
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:10,922
- Never.
- Okay.

22
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:12,298
Babe...

23
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:14,616
- Okay.
- ...need help with this diaper.

24
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,261
Oh, boy.

25
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:17,828
I think she wants mommy.

26
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:17,137
Fetid moppet.

27
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:22,559
Father.

28
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:36,257
We'll have someone
from the floor liaise with the outies.

29
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:40,244
We need to find out
who they talked to. Promptly.

30
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,434
<i>I need you to go see all of them.</i>

31
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,271
Find out every word they said
and who they said it to.

32
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:32,838
And shall I fire them?

33
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:35,316
Let Kier guide your hand.

34
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,508
Of course.

35
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,968
Please, sit.

36
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,867
We've commandeered the footage
taken by guests.

37
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:27,976
Natalie is already
doing outreach to media.

38
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:31,813
And the severed employees
who were involved are being dealt with.

39
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,201
Thank you for acting so quickly.

40
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:46,453
You saved us from disaster.

41
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,766
Will Mr. Eagan be joining?

42
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:50,874
Just me.

43
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,254
I personally owe you a debt of gratitude.

44
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:01,051
It cost me dearly.

45
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:03,762
It did.

46
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,349
And still,
you proved your loyalty tonight.

47
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,479
Which is why we'd like to ask you back.

48
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:26,410
An apology is warranted.

49
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:34,668
I apologize.

50
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:39,089
My father apologizes.

51
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:42,509
The Board apologizes.

52
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,971
We've treated you poorly.

53
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,683
I'm sorry.

54
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,984
I welcome your contrition.

55
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:02,779
I'm so glad.

56
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,410
There's much damage to control.

57
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:12,891
I recommend we start by scouring the feed,

58
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:17,103
and I need to interview Dylan G.
to see how he gained access to the--

59
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:18,795
We have something else in mind.

60
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:24,760
We'd like to offer you a promotion.

61
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,393
Severance Advisory Council.

62
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:47,074
I never heard of such a thing.

63
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:51,495
It's a brand-new initiative.
You'd be spearheading its formation.

64
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:55,332
Your expertise is greatly valued.

65
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:08,178
Which is why
I should be running the severed floor.

66
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:15,727
Mr. Milchick
has been promoted to floor manager.

67
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:25,571
You don't value me.

68
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:30,284
You fear me.

69
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:35,789
We fear no one.

70
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:46,234
<i>And if we didn't hold you
in such high esteem,</i>

71
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:48,719
we wouldn't be making this generous offer.

72
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:59,313
I'll put some thought to it.

73
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:10,365
Thank you for coming in, Harmony.
Mr. Drummond will see you out.

74
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:14,077
<i>I don't need an escort.</i>

75
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,068
Ready?

76
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:55,678
<i>Earlier this evening,</i>

77
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:59,182
<i>at an event where I was excited
to share my status as a severed individual</i>

78
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,124
<i>with a group of friends and allies,</i>

79
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:04,062
<i>I made the poor decision
to consume alcohol</i>

80
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:06,630
<i>while on a non-Lumon medication
for an arm rash.</i>

81
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:10,217
<i>This had an inebriating effect,</i>

82
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:13,595
<i>which caused me
to say some deeply regrettable things.</i>

83
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:18,600
- Ah, Mr. Milchick.
- Apologies for the hour.

84
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:20,894
Is everything all right?

85
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,523
How's your night been...
...Mr. Bailiff?

86
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:28,920
Fine. Uh, they're showing
<i>Barber of Seville</i> on TV.

87
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:30,964
So I've just been here.

88
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:33,365
Wonderful. And you're feeling well?

89
00:09:35,117 --> 00:09:37,929
Oh, God. What did I eat in there?

90
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:42,124
We just need to know
if anything of note occurred.

91
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,668
Anything at all.

92
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:49,965
W-Why don't you tell me
what's going on, Mr. Milchick?

93
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:52,277
<i>In the moment,
I thought I was being funny.</i>

94
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:54,821
But in the hours since this outburst,

95
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:58,366
I've been reminded
just how seriously my family's company

96
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,767
affects the lives of real people
around the world.

97
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,984
You know, your innie is a friend of mine.

98
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:13,322
I feel confident
he'd approve of me saying so.

99
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:18,535
And he's a man of principle,
which is rare.

100
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:22,581
Which is what makes this so difficult.

101
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:26,960
You're firing me?

102
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,647
When Lumon falters,

103
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:33,007
it's our cherished workers
and their families who suffer first.

104
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:39,240
<i>So for the fear and insecurity
this has caused, I must sincerely atone.</i>

105
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,326
You were involved
in a physical altercation

106
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,244
with another employee this evening.

107
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,497
It was brief but violent.

108
00:10:45,521 --> 00:10:47,749
And I regret to say
that you were the aggressor.

109
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:49,167
- Wait--
- As such,

110
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:52,670
I'm afraid we've no choice
but to terminate your employment,

111
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:54,506
effective immediately.

112
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:57,950
Distrust of Lumon
has been sadly endemic since its founding.

113
00:10:58,951 --> 00:11:03,014
My words provided more fuel
for a pernicious hate and derision.

114
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:05,642
You can't just do that.
What... What happened?

115
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:10,021
Did I break something? Or I-I can...
I can pay. I-I have cash upstairs.

116
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:11,796
When I said my innie was being tortured...

117
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,277
What am I supposed to tell my wife?

118
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:19,197
This was a joke and a lie.

119
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:20,305
I'm sorry.

120
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,479
I'm committed to this company
with every part of me.

121
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:38,323
<i>But I'm also human.</i>

122
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:42,911
Just like my innie...

123
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,123
<i>and just like you.</i>

124
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:20,860
Well,
that was more drama than I planned.

125
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:21,945
I guess so.

126
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:23,530
I'll let you know if we do
another reading.

127
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:24,638
Yes, please do.

128
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:30,620
And don't punish the baby, Ricken.
This wasn't its fault.

129
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:33,438
Of course. Good night, Rebeck.

130
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:37,168
I'm not the only one who heard you say it.

131
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:39,379
- It's not like I made this up.
- Right. You know, I'm just--

132
00:13:39,403 --> 00:13:41,464
We can reschedule
the reading to next month. It's fine.

133
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,091
I just have to decide
if I'm going to restart

134
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:44,175
- with chapter 1.
- So what?

135
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:46,034
So you said, "She's alive."

136
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:49,305
- If I may--
- I'm trying to help you.

137
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:52,600
If I may, I really did feel it was clear
you were referencing the baby.

138
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:55,562
- Patton had just saved her.
- Well, he found her, yeah.

139
00:13:55,586 --> 00:13:57,880
And I think that your workie was excited.

140
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,067
I have to say, Mark, he really is a jewel.

141
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:05,113
Guys,
obviously I was referencing the baby.

142
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:06,388
Yeah.

143
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,659
- Okay?
- Yes.

144
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:11,870
No...
Yeah. I agre... I think Ricken is right.

145
00:14:11,894 --> 00:14:12,829
I agree.

146
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:14,497
I... Babe,
will you take her for a second?

147
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:15,748
Uh, yep.

148
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,709
So let's...
...Occam's razor this shit.

149
00:14:17,733 --> 00:14:19,669
You're looking for Eleanor,

150
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:22,380
you find this picture,
which obviously is of interest to you,

151
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:23,756
- so you pick it up.
- Right.

152
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,967
And then when Patton found Eleanor--

153
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:28,303
- Saved her, I'd still say.
- Okay, whatever, yes.

154
00:14:28,327 --> 00:14:31,514
- You still had it with you.
- Yeah.

155
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:34,124
Yeah. I think it's the only thing
that makes sense.

156
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:38,313
Okay. And Eleanor
was in the study because...

157
00:14:38,337 --> 00:14:40,565
Because Mrs. Selvig left her in there.

158
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:41,816
- Or Cobel, whatever the fuck.
- Right.

159
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,903
Perhaps "Cobelvig"
would be a helpful nomenclature.

160
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:47,697
And assuming that "She's alive"
really was about the baby--

161
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:49,491
I mean, you don't think it was?

162
00:14:49,515 --> 00:14:51,951
- I do think it was.
- Then why are you saying it like that?

163
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:53,745
I don't... Sorry, I'm just exhausted.

164
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:56,164
- It's been a weird fucking night, Mark.
- Oh, my God.

165
00:14:56,188 --> 00:14:57,290
Why are you getting aggressive

166
00:14:57,314 --> 00:14:58,666
- with me right now?
- Oh, my God! Th--

167
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,919
- Okay, guys. Okay, okay.
- Whatever.

168
00:15:00,943 --> 00:15:04,154
Let's deal with what we know to be true,
all right?

169
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:09,826
Mark's workie went to great lengths
to awaken himself to alert us to abuses.

170
00:15:10,536 --> 00:15:12,204
Um, he was inspired by my book.

171
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:15,183
He found great meaning in it. Profundity.

172
00:15:15,207 --> 00:15:16,810
Um--

173
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:18,418
Oh, goddamn it, Rebeck.

174
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:21,171
- Honey, can-- Got her?
- Yeah.

175
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,361
What the fuck are you even saying?

176
00:15:26,385 --> 00:15:28,780
Why are you being a dick to me?
I'm trying to help you.

177
00:15:28,804 --> 00:15:30,907
- I'm just trying to get--
- Good evening, Dr. Hale.

178
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:33,684
- Good evening.
- Seth Milchick from Lumon.

179
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:35,769
Is Mark Scout here by chance?

180
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:39,499
Uh, yes, he is.

181
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:42,276
Um, come in.

182
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:45,070
Thank you.

183
00:15:50,868 --> 00:15:51,952
Mr. Scout.

184
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:55,998
I imagine you have a few questions.

185
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:59,751
Oh, you could say that.

186
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:01,336
May I sit with you?

187
00:16:03,881 --> 00:16:05,215
Right this way.

188
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:11,096
You must be Devon.

189
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:26,713
Okay. So...

190
00:16:26,737 --> 00:16:29,156
That is a magnificent helmet.

191
00:16:31,283 --> 00:16:32,284
Thank you.

192
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,581
What happened tonight is what we call
the "overtime contingency."

193
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:39,809
It's a safeguard we employ

194
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:43,962
if we ever need to access
your work personage off company grounds.

195
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:46,149
Yeah, you never told me about this.

196
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:49,259
OTC disclosure can be found
in your start paperwork.

197
00:16:50,594 --> 00:16:54,616
It seems the tech was commandeered
by one of your office mates,

198
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:58,101
allowing him to wake the rest of you
for a period of 39 minutes.

199
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:02,064
Innie Mark was here in this house.

200
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:06,276
I know. I talked to him.

201
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:10,196
What did he say to you?

202
00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:13,885
If I tell you,
are you gonna punish him for it?

203
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:16,012
We have no punishments at Lumon.

204
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:17,538
Uh-huh.

205
00:17:20,249 --> 00:17:23,377
We're more concerned
about how you're doing, Mr. Scout.

206
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:28,149
I can only imagine how violated
you feel by his actions.

207
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:29,776
- Yes, speaking of violations...
- You--

208
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,110
...just wondering how common it is

209
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:33,321
for your managers to commit
fucking lactation fraud

210
00:17:33,345 --> 00:17:35,097
against their employees' families.

211
00:17:38,392 --> 00:17:39,518
Pretty common?

212
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:41,454
Ms. Cobel.

213
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:42,729
Yeah.

214
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:49,212
What we learned tonight
is that she is quite severely unwell.

215
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:51,673
Uh, yeah. She lives next door to me.

216
00:17:51,697 --> 00:17:54,175
I, like, know her.

217
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:55,802
And her behavior at Lumon

218
00:17:55,826 --> 00:17:58,078
seems to be the source
of your innie's distress.

219
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:02,791
She will never descend
to that floor again.

220
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:07,296
Nor bedevil you out here any further.

221
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,881
You have my word.

222
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:14,595
But we do need to know
what we're dealing with.

223
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:20,184
Is there anything?
Anything you can tell me?

224
00:18:23,854 --> 00:18:24,980
I mean--

225
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,212
No... I mean, we're very tired.

226
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:32,797
Yes, we are.

227
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:37,576
I think, uh,
we've just said all there is to say.

228
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:47,002
Okay. Of course. I'll circle back.

229
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:51,715
In the meantime, I hope to see you Monday.

230
00:18:52,591 --> 00:18:53,800
Yeah. I don't know, man.

231
00:18:59,473 --> 00:19:04,436
What your innie did tonight
was completely unauthorized.

232
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:07,481
It was also very brave.

233
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:13,612
I'd hate to reward his courage
with nonexistence.

234
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,162
<i>You think we're about to meet our spouses?</i>

235
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:29,248
<i>Uh, maybe.</i>

236
00:21:29,873 --> 00:21:31,250
<i>Maybe it's each other.</i>

237
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:33,210
<i>That'd be a hoot.</i>

238
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:39,025
<i>Yeah. Yeah, like, uh,
mid-argument over car wash coupons.</i>

239
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:41,634
<i>"Honey, you're cutting them wrong!"</i>

240
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:48,600
<i>- Okay.
- All right.</i>

241
00:22:08,203 --> 00:22:11,874
In case we don't come back.

242
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:17,421
<i>Or, I don't know, in case we do?</i>

243
00:22:43,614 --> 00:22:46,909
<i>In case we don't come back.</i>

244
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:49,912
<i>Or, I don't know, in case we do?</i>

245
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:17,708
You got this.

246
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:21,044
No pressure. Be cool.

247
00:24:22,838 --> 00:24:25,299
You are so awesome. Smile.

248
00:24:39,855 --> 00:24:42,876
May I, um, ask about benefits?

249
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,484
There's a coffee maker.

250
00:24:45,944 --> 00:24:48,923
I meant, uh, health care benefits.

251
00:24:48,947 --> 00:24:51,533
Oh, sure. Yes, of course.
For you. Your family.

252
00:24:52,284 --> 00:24:55,054
Okay. Okay, great. Yeah, you know,

253
00:24:55,078 --> 00:24:58,290
I... I think this is gonna be
a really great fit for me, Mr. Saliba.

254
00:24:58,916 --> 00:25:00,852
You know...
...ever since I was a kid,

255
00:25:00,876 --> 00:25:03,212
- I've always felt like doors had--
- How old?

256
00:25:03,712 --> 00:25:04,713
Sorry?

257
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:07,841
How old were you
when you knew you loved doors?

258
00:25:10,928 --> 00:25:12,721
- Five.
- Mm-hmm.

259
00:25:14,306 --> 00:25:16,808
If you could be any kind of door,
what would it be?

260
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:19,811
Uh...

261
00:25:21,605 --> 00:25:22,773
pocket.

262
00:25:23,357 --> 00:25:25,776
- Interesting. Tell me more.
- Yes.

263
00:25:27,861 --> 00:25:32,658
Well, you're, you know,
doing your door thing and then,

264
00:25:33,283 --> 00:25:35,011
uh, when you're not needed, you can just--

265
00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:36,787
Just tuck yourself away.

266
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,374
Flat finish or eggshell?

267
00:25:43,293 --> 00:25:44,687
- Semi-gloss.
- Oh.

268
00:25:44,711 --> 00:25:47,172
Hmm. That's hot.

269
00:25:48,632 --> 00:25:51,343
You remind me of me, Dylan.

270
00:25:53,428 --> 00:25:54,471
You like kickball?

271
00:25:56,765 --> 00:26:01,955
As a skill? Or, like,
do I follow it professionally? I--

272
00:26:01,979 --> 00:26:03,289
Yeah.

273
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:05,899
We play on Fridays.
There's a fun prize if you win.

274
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,360
You mean a door prize.

275
00:26:15,492 --> 00:26:16,302
Sorry.

276
00:26:16,326 --> 00:26:20,372
A lot of short-term employment.
And then Lumon.

277
00:26:20,914 --> 00:26:23,101
- Yes.
- And they make their doors in-house.

278
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:24,459
It's fucking hubris.

279
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:28,940
Uh... yeah.

280
00:26:28,964 --> 00:26:32,134
Um, I was a severed employee, so...

281
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:36,471
You're a severed?

282
00:26:38,223 --> 00:26:41,119
Yes. Yeah, I was. Um, but you know,

283
00:26:41,143 --> 00:26:43,729
it's just me here and, um...

284
00:26:45,272 --> 00:26:47,250
Well, Mr. George, thanks for coming in.

285
00:26:47,274 --> 00:26:48,585
What?

286
00:26:48,609 --> 00:26:50,652
We'll consider
your application thoroughly.

287
00:26:51,445 --> 00:26:53,923
That's it?
Just because I'm severed?

288
00:26:53,947 --> 00:26:56,676
Like I said, we'll consider
your application thoroughly.

289
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,761
Okay. You're not considering me at all.
That's discrimination.

290
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:00,930
We need a certain kind of person here,
Mr. George,

291
00:27:00,954 --> 00:27:02,640
not a certain kind of two people.

292
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:04,058
What do you think this is?
A carpet factory?

293
00:27:04,082 --> 00:27:06,102
- What?
- You want to circumcise your brain,

294
00:27:06,126 --> 00:27:07,312
that's your business.

295
00:27:07,336 --> 00:27:12,424
But it doesn't mean I have to hire you.
And personally, I think it's abhorrent.

296
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:36,633
Read the room.

297
00:27:36,657 --> 00:27:38,760
I would have picked up the phone
if it was good news.

298
00:27:38,784 --> 00:27:42,639
<i>Oh, I'm sorry. You'll get the next one.</i>

299
00:27:42,663 --> 00:27:43,914
Stop being nice.

300
00:27:50,629 --> 00:27:54,383
Hey, do we need, um...
Do we need more baby wipeys?

301
00:27:54,925 --> 00:27:55,985
<i>I don't think so.</i>

302
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:59,614
You know what? I'll get some anyway.
I'll be home soon.

303
00:27:59,638 --> 00:28:01,223
<i>Okay. Bye, hon.</i>

304
00:28:09,898 --> 00:28:11,441
<i>So, he's your boss?</i>

305
00:28:12,067 --> 00:28:14,528
And what about "Cobelvig"?
Have you heard from her?

306
00:28:15,237 --> 00:28:17,674
I went by there.
No one answered the door though.

307
00:28:17,698 --> 00:28:20,677
Fuck. Well, I was just thinking,

308
00:28:20,701 --> 00:28:24,037
maybe there was a way we could confirm
what your innie meant.

309
00:28:25,831 --> 00:28:27,684
Devon. Jesus Christ. Are you serious?

310
00:28:27,708 --> 00:28:29,644
I know we're not supposed to contact him...

311
00:28:29,668 --> 00:28:31,312
...but Danise is a lawyer and apparently,

312
00:28:31,336 --> 00:28:33,088
- you can petition--
- I'm quitting.

313
00:28:34,965 --> 00:28:36,175
- You're quitting?
- Yeah.

314
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:42,514
Okay. Have you...
Have you called them already?

315
00:28:43,098 --> 00:28:45,017
No, I was gonna do it tonight.

316
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:46,810
Uh-huh.

317
00:28:47,936 --> 00:28:49,581
I'm sorry.

318
00:28:49,605 --> 00:28:52,333
Haven't you been trying to get me
to quit that place since I got there?

319
00:28:52,357 --> 00:28:54,627
I thought
I was finally doing what you want.

320
00:28:54,651 --> 00:28:58,155
No. Yes, but don't you think
that was strange last night?

321
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:01,092
I mean... why was he so curious?

322
00:29:01,116 --> 00:29:06,097
Devon, what are you doing?
You remember I identified her, right?

323
00:29:06,121 --> 00:29:08,099
- Yes, Mark.
- I saw her body.

324
00:29:08,123 --> 00:29:09,208
Yeah, I know.

325
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:15,023
My thing is, if we could just get, like,
a half-step more confirmation,

326
00:29:15,047 --> 00:29:18,651
then it's not gonna be something
that continues to haunt us.

327
00:29:18,675 --> 00:29:20,153
- Do you know what I mean?
- Us?

328
00:29:20,177 --> 00:29:23,114
Yes. She was my family too, Mark. Fuck.

329
00:29:23,138 --> 00:29:25,492
Yeah. But she was my wife.

330
00:29:25,516 --> 00:29:27,952
I know, but you're not the only one
her death affected.

331
00:29:27,976 --> 00:29:29,370
- Oh, really? It affected you?
- Yes.

332
00:29:29,394 --> 00:29:32,397
Did you have to tell her parents
that she was dead?

333
00:29:33,232 --> 00:29:34,375
How about her students?

334
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:35,460
How about this.

335
00:29:35,484 --> 00:29:39,863
Did your sheets smell like her
for weeks afterwards?

336
00:29:42,491 --> 00:29:46,679
You know what? Honestly,
if Ricken died and his body burned,

337
00:29:46,703 --> 00:29:48,681
- I'd be sad for you.
- Wow.

338
00:29:48,705 --> 00:29:50,207
But I wouldn't be affected.

339
00:29:51,124 --> 00:29:52,185
This is obscene.

340
00:29:52,209 --> 00:29:53,394
I just want to be sure.

341
00:29:53,418 --> 00:29:55,045
I am sure!

342
00:30:03,178 --> 00:30:04,680
- I'll talk to you later.
- Mark.

343
00:30:06,723 --> 00:30:07,724
Mark.

344
00:31:24,593 --> 00:31:25,820
Okay.

345
00:31:25,844 --> 00:31:27,596
You're not picking up. I get it.

346
00:31:28,096 --> 00:31:30,891
I want you to know
my innie got the message.

347
00:32:27,197 --> 00:32:28,240
Mr. Milchick?

348
00:32:30,492 --> 00:32:32,202
{\an8}Compliments of the company.

349
00:32:34,705 --> 00:32:36,683
We got off on the wrong foot last night.

350
00:32:36,707 --> 00:32:38,792
- Hmm.
- Okay to talk a minute?

351
00:32:41,295 --> 00:32:43,505
Uh, yeah. Come on in.

352
00:32:45,424 --> 00:32:46,425
Thank you.

353
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:57,495
So, Mr. Scout, I know you're still
weighing whether to return to Lumon.

354
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,645
Yeah.

355
00:33:00,564 --> 00:33:03,734
I'd like to ask you a few questions
that may inform your decision.

356
00:33:04,693 --> 00:33:05,986
Is that all right?

357
00:33:06,862 --> 00:33:08,840
Okay.

358
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,282
Terrific.

359
00:33:11,158 --> 00:33:15,537
First, how happy are you
with your current financial compensation?

360
00:33:16,496 --> 00:33:17,473
Uh...

361
00:33:17,497 --> 00:33:22,187
I ask because our endearment to you
is such that a 20% bump is on the table,

362
00:33:22,211 --> 00:33:23,337
should you return.

363
00:33:25,088 --> 00:33:28,485
Oh, 20%. Um. Wow.

364
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:33,072
My second question is whether a full
investigation into your innie's claims,

365
00:33:33,096 --> 00:33:36,201
and regular wellness checks
from independent orgs,

366
00:33:36,225 --> 00:33:39,019
would help you
feel more excited to return?

367
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:42,248
Well, I... I don't know.
Is that what they're doing?

368
00:33:42,272 --> 00:33:43,899
It's the first step of many.

369
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,241
My third question
concerns your late wife, Gemma.

370
00:33:57,204 --> 00:33:58,205
What about her?

371
00:33:59,498 --> 00:34:00,683
In your intake interview,

372
00:34:00,707 --> 00:34:04,169
you cited her death
as a primary motivator for severing.

373
00:34:06,296 --> 00:34:07,714
Do you remember what you said?

374
00:34:09,466 --> 00:34:10,467
No.

375
00:34:11,385 --> 00:34:14,847
You said since she died,
every day feels like a year.

376
00:34:17,014 --> 00:34:19,643
That you felt like
you were choking on her ghost.

377
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,397
Do you still feel that way, Mr. Scout?

378
00:34:33,031 --> 00:34:35,742
The Mark I've come to know
at Lumon is happy.

379
00:34:37,286 --> 00:34:40,746
He cares for people and he's funny.

380
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,918
He knows nothing of the pain
I see in you right now.

381
00:34:51,842 --> 00:34:52,842
He's found love.

382
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,761
Love?

383
00:34:57,014 --> 00:34:58,199
With who?

384
00:34:58,223 --> 00:35:03,145
The solace you have given him down there
will make its way to you.

385
00:35:04,771 --> 00:35:05,939
It just takes time.

386
00:35:08,233 --> 00:35:12,154
I hope you'll give us that time,
Mr. Scout.

387
00:36:14,842 --> 00:36:16,218
Are you satisfied with this?

388
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:20,138
The sister seems more uppity than he is.

389
00:36:22,182 --> 00:36:23,892
So, who are you bringing into MDR?

390
00:36:24,518 --> 00:36:29,064
I've got a floater from overseas
and a pair who were laid off from 5X.

391
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:30,691
5X?

392
00:36:32,401 --> 00:36:33,402
Really?

393
00:36:35,153 --> 00:36:38,031
<i>I had 48 hours to pull this together.</i>

394
00:36:38,907 --> 00:36:40,659
<i>Hopefully there will be some chemistry.</i>

395
00:36:45,581 --> 00:36:47,332
<i>We don't need chemistry.</i>

396
00:36:48,834 --> 00:36:50,436
<i>We need Mark S. back to work.</i>

397
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,545
Go on ahead.

398
00:36:52,296 --> 00:36:54,298
Long enough to complete Cold Harbor.

399
00:36:56,049 --> 00:36:57,426
- See you tonight.
- All right.

400
00:37:03,891 --> 00:37:05,642
- Good night, Mr. Scout.
- Good night, Judd.

401
00:37:06,143 --> 00:37:07,579
Good morning, Mr. Scout.

402
00:37:07,603 --> 00:37:08,770
Morning, Judd.

403
00:37:09,646 --> 00:37:11,607
- Good night, Mr. Scout.
- Night, Judd.

404
00:37:14,818 --> 00:37:16,212
Good morning, Mr. Scout.

405
00:37:16,236 --> 00:37:17,529
Good morning, Judd.

406
00:37:42,095 --> 00:37:43,847
- Mr. Scout.
- Good night, Judd.

407
00:37:49,811 --> 00:37:51,831
<i>Hello? Is anyone there?
Is the Board on?</i>

408
00:37:51,855 --> 00:37:55,692
<i>It's Mark S. from Macrodata Refinement.</i>

409
00:37:56,318 --> 00:37:58,713
<i>Okay. Well</i>...
...<i>if you're there, please listen.</i>

410
00:37:58,737 --> 00:38:02,175
<i>Now, I know that you want to
do the right thing for severed people,</i>

411
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:05,428
<i>- which is why I need to see my team again.
- Mark!</i>

412
00:38:05,452 --> 00:38:08,264
<i>If we truly are the face
of severance reform, as you say,</i>

413
00:38:08,288 --> 00:38:11,392
<i>- then they deserve a chance.
- Mark!</i>

414
00:38:11,416 --> 00:38:14,628
{\an8}<i>Please. They're my friends!
You can't just make them disappear!</i>

415
00:38:19,883 --> 00:38:21,885
Of course, I bear full responsibility.

416
00:38:22,761 --> 00:38:24,763
The Board's gonna give him what he wants,

417
00:38:25,973 --> 00:38:27,641
including Helly R.

418
00:38:29,726 --> 00:38:31,353
He won't finish without them.

419
00:38:47,786 --> 00:38:48,787
Mr. Milchick?

420
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:52,416
Mr. George.

421
00:39:16,815 --> 00:39:18,418
This is unheard of.

422
00:39:18,442 --> 00:39:20,211
- I'm sorry, Mr. Wilkins.
- Three days of work.

423
00:39:20,235 --> 00:39:22,589
I broke a fucking lease in Grand Rapids.

424
00:39:22,613 --> 00:39:23,923
Fucking touch me.

425
00:39:23,947 --> 00:39:25,574
Give me another reason to sue.

426
00:39:26,783 --> 00:39:28,368
Fuck you, Lumon!

427
00:39:33,081 --> 00:39:34,208
- Hey, Judd.
- Mm-hmm.

428
00:40:59,668 --> 00:41:00,669
Morning, Judd.

429
00:42:17,621 --> 00:42:18,622
Hey!

430
00:42:22,793 --> 00:42:26,088
Hello, Mark. Just back from work?

431
00:42:29,675 --> 00:42:31,301
Where do you think you're going?

432
00:42:32,594 --> 00:42:33,762
What do you care?

433
00:42:35,764 --> 00:42:37,766
What do I care?

434
00:42:38,475 --> 00:42:39,476
What do I c--

435
00:42:41,353 --> 00:42:42,354
Who are you?

436
00:42:43,522 --> 00:42:45,482
I thought you were quitting.

437
00:42:46,024 --> 00:42:47,234
I trusted you.

438
00:42:48,652 --> 00:42:52,155
I told you what I'd gone through
these past two years.

439
00:42:53,448 --> 00:42:54,449
You...

440
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:01,248
You were in my house. You...

441
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:04,918
I ate your shitty fucking cookies.

442
00:43:07,629 --> 00:43:09,339
They convinced you to stay?

443
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,594
Was a pineapple involved?

444
00:43:17,598 --> 00:43:19,183
You're so easy to sway.

445
00:43:22,394 --> 00:43:25,062
What? So that's it? You're just...
You're le... You're leaving?

446
00:43:26,607 --> 00:43:28,442
Are you fucking kid--

447
00:43:37,451 --> 00:43:41,955
Why did you do this?
What the fuck is this all about?

448
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,852
Do you know something about Gemma?

449
00:44:34,508 --> 00:44:35,676
Whoa!
