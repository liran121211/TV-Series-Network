1
00:00:02,294 --> 00:00:03,754
I acknowledge that, henceforth,

2
00:00:03,836 --> 00:00:08,132
my access to my memories
will be spatially dictated.

3
00:00:09,218 --> 00:00:11,720
I will be unable to access
outside recollections

4
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:14,848
whilst on Lumon's
severed basement floor,

5
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:17,351
nor retain work memories upon my ascent.

6
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:22,898
I am aware that this alteration

7
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:25,526
is comprehensive and irreversible.

8
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:29,112
I make these statements freely.

9
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:34,117
Okay, that's a wrap.

10
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:38,205
Come with me, please.

11
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,257
So your work personage will be waking
in a few hours on the severed floor.

12
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,593
But the next time you yourself
will be sentient will be this evening,

13
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:53,136
in the elevator back up.

14
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,221
Okay.

15
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:58,267
The elevator has a handrail at hip-level
if you feel dizzy.

16
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,768
Oh, man.

17
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:04,815
I love seeing the sunrise on his face.

18
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:09,361
You know he used to drink three raw eggs
in milk each morning?

19
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,445
I've heard.

20
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:12,114
His favorite breakfast.

21
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,533
We'll get you prepped in here.

22
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,176
- Good morning, Lawrence.
- Good morning.

23
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:45,189
They say it doesn't hurt.

24
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,403
Just relax.

25
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,378
Little vibration now.

26
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:50,003
I'll be upstairs after
to let you know how it went.

27
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:53,757
Sorry if I freak out on you a little.

28
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:58,428
Don't worry. I'm very
excited to meet you.

29
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:41,805
Hey, Helly.

30
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:43,932
What's happening?

31
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:45,142
Great to see you.

32
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,103
Your orientation's been so much fun.

33
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,232
Where am I?

34
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:57,404
Okay, so sometimes when a new hire
is adjusting to a severed space,

35
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,698
we help by bringing them here
to the stairwell,

36
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,658
to experience the transition viscerally.

37
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,619
Oh, no. I'm trying to leave?

38
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:04,912
No, no.

39
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:06,455
It's all part of the process.

40
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:09,018
If you wanna spin around
and head back in, that should be that.

41
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:14,838
Hey, there.

42
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,427
- What the hell?
- That's okay.

43
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,262
Not a problem.

44
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,640
Wanna give it another shot?

45
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:26,141
Maybe with a little oomph?

46
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,480
Hi.

47
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:33,982
I'm at the stairwell.

48
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:36,777
It's going fair.

49
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:39,321
No, she's...

50
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,405
Fuck!

51
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:42,991
I'ma call you back.

52
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:46,245
Wow.

53
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:50,415
You're an inquisitive one.

54
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,501
I don't wanna be in there, do I?

55
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:53,794
You're learning that you do.

56
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,882
Hey, when we heard you were coming here,
it was like a miracle.

57
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,593
It's amazing what you're doing.

58
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:25,367
Hey, old-timer!

59
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:27,160
One day down.

60
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:43,232
Hey.

61
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,234
Hey.

62
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:46,610
So it's tomorrow now?

63
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:48,946
Yeah.

64
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,822
Well, it's Monday.

65
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:53,200
- A weekend just happened?
- Yeah.

66
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:54,701
I don't even feel like I left.

67
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:57,496
Yeah, that's how nights
and weekends feel here.

68
00:08:58,288 --> 00:08:59,289
Like nothing?

69
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:00,499
Well, you get used to it.

70
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:03,210
I mean, I find it helps to
focus on the effects of sleep

71
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:05,629
since we don't actually
get to experience it.

72
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:09,216
You may feel rejuvenated or happy.

73
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,885
Less tense in the shoulders. Spry.

74
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:15,931
So it's 09:05?

75
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:19,268
Yeah, they stagger the entries too
so we don't meet on the outside.

76
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:20,686
It's important apparently.

77
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:24,940
So I guess we're not friends.

78
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:27,901
Guess not.

79
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,074
My current file's called "Tumwater"...

80
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,368
which I started some 11 weeks back.

81
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:37,786
"Tumwater." All one word.

82
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,413
Should I be taking notes?

83
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,832
- No.
- I've got it 96% sorted,

84
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,585
which means I've earned
four of the five tier incentives,

85
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:49,256
including the erasers and the finger
traps that you see displayed here.

86
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,010
100% is tier five.
That gets you a caricature portrait.

87
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:56,972
You'll note I've accrued an
embarrassment of wealth in that regard.

88
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:58,515
- Wow.
- Correct.

89
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:00,976
Each one of these?
Finished file in the can.

90
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:03,312
So that's the highest award?

91
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:04,521
Percentage-wise, yes.

92
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:06,690
But if we hit our numbers
by quarter's end,

93
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,817
one of us gets named
refiner of the quarter,

94
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:11,195
and that shit gets you a waffle party.

95
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:12,863
I'm sorry, a waffle party?

96
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,364
Okay, hazards on, eager lemur.

97
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:17,701
I'm a dead lock for that this quarter,
so don't get your hopes up.

98
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:22,414
What about Mark's crystal head cube?

99
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:25,417
That's not a prize,
that's just something they gave him.

100
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:27,878
Helly, could you flip on this console?

101
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:45,479
Okay.

102
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:49,191
That's... Excuse me.

103
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:58,951
Mark, sorry to interrupt.
I know you're training Helly.

104
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:02,246
I just noticed you've removed
the group photos from the desks.

105
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:05,457
Yeah. We're gonna take the new ones
at Helly's party today.

106
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:11,880
Okay, this is the Siena file.

107
00:11:11,964 --> 00:11:13,799
Now, all the data you see

108
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:17,344
falls into one of four
essential categories.

109
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:19,555
And we group each line of code,

110
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:24,184
and then sort it evenly
between five digital buckets.

111
00:11:24,268 --> 00:11:25,269
Party.

112
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:27,229
Just poke around first. Use the arrows.

113
00:11:27,855 --> 00:11:31,233
I do think the old photos are supposed
to stay on the desk

114
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:32,943
until the new ones come in.

115
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:40,951
Right.

116
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:43,787
- Should this mean something to me?
- No.

117
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:46,331
No, all the data
comes from upstairs fully encoded.

118
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,917
Then how do I categorize it?

119
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:52,045
What?

120
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:58,677
Each category of numbers
presents in such an order as to elicit

121
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,971
an emotional response in the refiner.

122
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:07,477
So, Cat 1 numbers, for example,
feel a certain way on sight.

123
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:10,731
They'll be sort of disconcerting, scary.

124
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:11,815
Scary?

125
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:13,108
I know.

126
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:14,943
My job is to scroll
through this spreadsheet

127
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:16,612
and look for numbers that are scary?

128
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:18,697
It sounds dumb, and Mark said it dumb.

129
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:21,950
Are the numbers bloody? Do they chant?

130
00:12:22,034 --> 00:12:24,912
It doesn't make sense till you see it,
and it takes a while to see.

131
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:26,872
Hey, Mark. I just printed out

132
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:29,333
the passage of the handbook
on changing out group photos.

133
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,544
Just might be good to peruse
when you're between things.

134
00:12:32,628 --> 00:12:34,463
- Thank you.
- Sorry.

135
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:38,967
Am I trapped here?

136
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:42,638
In what way?

137
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:46,433
Like if it turns out I hate this
and I want to quit, is that an option?

138
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:51,188
Look.

139
00:12:52,523 --> 00:12:53,815
If you're really unhappy,

140
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:58,111
you can submit a resignation request
with your outside self for review.

141
00:12:58,195 --> 00:13:00,072
And good luck getting that approved.

142
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:03,867
Well, they do tend to be rejected.
Plus, you know...

143
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:06,453
What?

144
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:12,167
Well, since this perceptual
version of you only exists at Lumon,

145
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:15,462
I mean, quitting
would effectively end your life.

146
00:13:15,546 --> 00:13:17,464
I mean, in so much
as you've come to know it.

147
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:20,968
Hello, Refiners.

148
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:23,136
Sweet. Melon bar.

149
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,680
Hi, Mr. Milchick.

150
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:27,099
Helly, welcome.

151
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:30,686
I'm agog at how well I can tell
you're already fitting in.

152
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:33,397
The office feels whole.

153
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:38,527
Now, let's get this party started.

154
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:47,870
Well, my name is
Irving, as you all know.

155
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:50,122
And I've worked here for three years,

156
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:55,002
and something about me is that
I know all nine core Lumon principles.

157
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:57,546
Awesome. What's your favorite?

158
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:01,550
All nine.

159
00:14:02,426 --> 00:14:06,680
But today, I think I'd say, "cheer".

160
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:07,764
Great.

161
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,229
No trust fall today, Irv.

162
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,441
Right.

163
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:28,202
No. No.

164
00:14:35,918 --> 00:14:37,878
Hello, I'm Helly.

165
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:39,671
I've been at Lumon for, like...

166
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:41,840
ten hours total, and...

167
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:46,553
I'm sorry,
I don't know anything about myself.

168
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:48,847
Sure you do, Helly.

169
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:51,308
I really don't.

170
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:53,924
I guess I went home last night,

171
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:56,063
but I don't know if home is a house,
or an apartment,

172
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:57,290
or if I live with a family...

173
00:14:57,314 --> 00:14:59,983
I like to think my outie lives on,
like, a riverboat.

174
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,612
I'm sorry, outies are...

175
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:06,490
They're us on the outside.

176
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,784
You saw yours yesterday in the video.

177
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:12,120
Right. I actually have a few things to
say to her. Can I record something back?

178
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:16,917
So what you'll find here is that
communication between selves

179
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,377
is pretty curtailed.

180
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:20,462
So what if I write her a note?

181
00:15:20,546 --> 00:15:24,591
Fortunately, the elevators are equipped
with something called "code detectors."

182
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,969
So messages can't be passed through.

183
00:15:27,052 --> 00:15:30,472
Yeah... They're like metal detectors
for written symbols.

184
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:31,807
A Lumon original, apparently.

185
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:32,975
That's right. Right.

186
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:34,893
Sure. Okay, well what if I...

187
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:37,688
I don't think you're quite
getting the game here, Helly.

188
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:39,898
May I?

189
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:44,027
Guys, this is Helly.

190
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:47,447
She's 30 years old, she's allergic
to almonds and has weak enamel.

191
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:51,243
At 5'6'', she's the fourth
tallest person in your office,

192
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:54,496
and her hair
is what we call shoulder-length.

193
00:15:56,123 --> 00:16:00,419
And seeing her here with you all, I'd
say she most definitely has a family.

194
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:09,094
Wow. Well, that's a lot to follow.

195
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:12,514
So I'll just say that I'm Mark.

196
00:16:12,598 --> 00:16:18,312
Been with Lumon about two years,
and I absolutely love this game.

197
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:23,567
Nice try, pal,
but you said that last time.

198
00:16:24,902 --> 00:16:26,361
Fair enough.

199
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:31,200
Well, I...

200
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:40,334
I broke protocol this morning.

201
00:16:43,921 --> 00:16:46,924
I was dusting the old group photos,
the ones with Petey,

202
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:48,550
and it just...

203
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:52,054
made me feel sad.

204
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:55,265
And, I guess,

205
00:16:56,225 --> 00:17:00,103
worried that I won't be able to
run MDR like he did.

206
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:02,231
That tracks. I have similar worries.

207
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:04,775
So I...

208
00:17:05,776 --> 00:17:08,862
took 'em from the cubicles
and put 'em in the storage closet,

209
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:11,156
which we're not supposed to do.

210
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:15,702
I recall this. I objected.

211
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:21,124
Thank you for telling me, Mark.

212
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:25,253
I actually find your reaction sweet.

213
00:17:25,337 --> 00:17:29,383
Though, it is puzzling you have
an outburst like this for Petey,

214
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:32,553
and not for, say, Carol D.

215
00:17:33,512 --> 00:17:36,557
But we knew
Carol D. was leaving beforehand.

216
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,600
I mean, her outie filmed a thank-you.

217
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,728
Petey was just gone.

218
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:45,107
And I mean, I... I don't know

219
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:51,488
if he's at some new job
or drunk on a beach, or dead...

220
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:53,031
That's enough, please.

221
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,043
I think this is a good time
to remind ourselves

222
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:08,255
that things like deaths
happen outside of here.

223
00:18:09,715 --> 00:18:10,716
Not here.

224
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:15,179
A life at Lumon is protected
from such things.

225
00:18:16,305 --> 00:18:21,977
And I think a great potential response
to that from all of you is gratitude.

226
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:33,614
I also think
that melon isn't getting any tastier.

227
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:10,400
Hey, sorry I derailed your game.

228
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:15,280
I thought I already had, but then, yeah,
you made it way worse.

229
00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:20,786
So how are you gonna figure out
if Petey's okay?

230
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:23,372
I think Milchick was pretty clear.

231
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:26,089
You're just done
asking about your best friend

232
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:27,918
because our babysitter told you to stop?

233
00:19:30,045 --> 00:19:32,214
You know, Milchick's a nice man.

234
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:35,175
When he says something,
it's best to listen.

235
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:38,095
- I don't care.
- 'Cause he can't always be nice like that.

236
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,097
Okay, Refiners!

237
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:43,350
Let's get this new group photo
before the melon bloat sets in.

238
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:56,488
At last.

239
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:04,329
All right. Great big smiles. Remember,
you're gonna be looking at this every day.

240
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:07,624
Say "gratitude."

241
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,585
Gratitude!

242
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:13,881
Say "cheer."

243
00:20:14,423 --> 00:20:15,883
Cheer!

244
00:20:20,262 --> 00:20:22,181
Helly? What are you doing?

245
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:26,143
I just think
I'm not gonna work here anymore. Sorry.

246
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:27,394
What do you mean?

247
00:20:27,978 --> 00:20:28,978
I quit.

248
00:20:29,021 --> 00:20:30,731
I don't wanna do the file-sorting thing

249
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:33,209
or the never-seeing-the-sun-thing
or the disappearing-friends thing.

250
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:35,753
- I just don't want any of it.
- We told you there's code detectors.

251
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:39,489
Do you know that? Have you tried?
Because frankly, it sounds made-up.

252
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:48,582
Helly!

253
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:53,253
Helly!

254
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:07,142
Please, you don't know...

255
00:21:09,061 --> 00:21:10,646
Oh, God. Come on.

256
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:23,116
Shit. Mr. Graner?

257
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:27,704
Come on out.

258
00:21:33,627 --> 00:21:35,045
What have we got here?

259
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:39,675
Perhaps you'd better come with me.

260
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:40,843
Mr. Graner.

261
00:21:43,554 --> 00:21:47,766
Hey. I see you've found
my wayward trainee.

262
00:21:48,892 --> 00:21:50,936
Appreciate your help, sir, as always.

263
00:21:53,981 --> 00:21:54,982
The note.

264
00:21:55,607 --> 00:21:59,403
So, this is embarrassing,
but it's my first time training,

265
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:03,699
and I must've just forgotten to go over
data-smuggling rules with Helly.

266
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:06,702
Sorry. This is Helly.

267
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:07,786
Helly, Mr. Graner.

268
00:22:08,996 --> 00:22:09,997
Yeah.

269
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:14,668
Yeah, so if Helly
tripped the code detectors,

270
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:19,298
that one, it's on me
and I apologize for that, sir.

271
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:20,799
Earnestly.

272
00:22:22,593 --> 00:22:24,303
Big department chief now, Mark S.?

273
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:25,971
Well...

274
00:22:27,556 --> 00:22:30,517
On you, then. Let's go.

275
00:23:46,635 --> 00:23:47,886
Mark.

276
00:23:51,056 --> 00:23:52,933
So you're a doula?

277
00:23:53,016 --> 00:23:55,352
A midwife, actually.

278
00:23:57,688 --> 00:24:01,525
And how many deliveries have you,
I don't know, seen?

279
00:24:05,404 --> 00:24:06,822
Over 300?

280
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:09,199
This is mostly back in Montana.

281
00:24:09,283 --> 00:24:11,743
- Wow. That's so cool.
- Yeah.

282
00:24:11,827 --> 00:24:14,162
That's such a high amount.

283
00:24:14,246 --> 00:24:17,749
Yeah. We get two a day.

284
00:24:18,876 --> 00:24:19,918
Depending.

285
00:24:30,012 --> 00:24:32,723
So, is that, like, ten a week?

286
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:34,725
Like, in a five-day work week, or...

287
00:24:34,808 --> 00:24:36,435
- Yeah, or so.
- Yeah. Okay.

288
00:24:37,436 --> 00:24:41,106
- Are you vetting me for your sister?
- No. Oh, no. You seem great.

289
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:42,733
- Yeah, I'm kidding.
- I know.

290
00:24:52,326 --> 00:24:53,410
Thank you.

291
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:55,996
So, Lumon?

292
00:24:57,122 --> 00:24:58,957
- Yeah.
- Like half this town.

293
00:24:59,791 --> 00:25:01,835
And half of me. That was a joke.

294
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:03,962
It was funny.

295
00:25:04,046 --> 00:25:09,885
Yeah. I'm in the archives division, sort
of a corporate historian, apparently.

296
00:25:10,802 --> 00:25:14,181
So a lot of sensitive
material, hence the...

297
00:25:16,892 --> 00:25:18,310
So you don't know...

298
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:23,148
who you work with, or what you do,
or... or anything?

299
00:25:23,232 --> 00:25:24,942
Yeah, that's the idea.

300
00:25:25,025 --> 00:25:27,319
- What if you snuck in a note?
- You can't sneak notes.

301
00:25:27,903 --> 00:25:28,946
So...

302
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,966
- you could have a girlfriend at Lumon...
- Thank you.

303
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:32,991
...and not know it.

304
00:25:33,075 --> 00:25:35,702
And if you met someone out here,
you wouldn't know it in there.

305
00:25:36,286 --> 00:25:38,163
Like, you could get
married and have kids,

306
00:25:38,247 --> 00:25:40,791
and just forget they exist
for eight hours every day,

307
00:25:40,874 --> 00:25:42,251
for your whole life.

308
00:25:42,835 --> 00:25:44,336
That doesn't mess with your head?

309
00:25:47,631 --> 00:25:50,384
I think for some people, it's the point.

310
00:25:55,305 --> 00:25:59,560
So, as a local, this just feels like
a reasonable temperature to you?

311
00:25:59,643 --> 00:26:01,603
Well, technically, I'm from Ganz.

312
00:26:01,687 --> 00:26:04,022
And you're one to talk.

313
00:26:04,106 --> 00:26:08,318
Isn't Minnesota, like,
crazy cold with the lakes?

314
00:26:08,402 --> 00:26:10,737
Yes. Minnesota was very cold

315
00:26:10,821 --> 00:26:14,908
the one time I visited
from my home in Montana.

316
00:26:15,868 --> 00:26:17,068
So those are different places.

317
00:26:20,414 --> 00:26:22,165
So do you live in Lumon housing?

318
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,669
You make it sound
like dorms or something.

319
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,648
- No, I just meant that there's...
- I live in Baird Creek.

320
00:26:28,672 --> 00:26:33,343
And, yes, they happen to be subsidized
by the company that employs me.

321
00:26:33,427 --> 00:26:35,780
Excuse me, do you have a moment
for children's brain health?

322
00:26:35,804 --> 00:26:37,444
And legalized severance
in the workplace?

323
00:26:38,974 --> 00:26:41,602
- Nice. The WMC's out and about.
- Who?

324
00:26:41,685 --> 00:26:44,313
Most severed workers don't see the sun
their whole lives.

325
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:46,690
The Whole Mind
Collective. They're great.

326
00:26:46,773 --> 00:26:49,443
Excuse me, do you have a moment
for children's brain health?

327
00:26:49,526 --> 00:26:50,527
We're all good.

328
00:26:50,611 --> 00:26:52,547
You folks have a moment
for children's brain health?

329
00:26:52,571 --> 00:26:53,447
- We do.
- Great!

330
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:55,240
We're trying to get a measure
on the ballot

331
00:26:55,324 --> 00:26:58,076
to keep mega-corporations like Lumon
from continuing to force

332
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,470
legalized severance on our state.

333
00:26:59,494 --> 00:27:00,871
They're forcing it now?

334
00:27:00,954 --> 00:27:03,808
That's what they're lobbying for. And
Jame Eagan is trying to sever kids...

335
00:27:03,832 --> 00:27:07,085
Okay, well, what about the
self-mutilating types who do it willingly?

336
00:27:07,169 --> 00:27:09,671
I mean, I heard that some of them
are so deluded

337
00:27:09,755 --> 00:27:11,507
they don't even know they're victims.

338
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:14,176
I also heard that if you're severed,

339
00:27:14,259 --> 00:27:17,346
you go to two separate hells.
Is that true?

340
00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:19,848
Hey, man, you wanna benefit off
forced labor, that's up...

341
00:27:19,932 --> 00:27:22,142
- Hey, man. Forced labor?
- ...then that's up to you.

342
00:27:22,226 --> 00:27:23,268
Fucking really?

343
00:27:23,352 --> 00:27:24,561
- Hey!
- Yeah.

344
00:27:24,645 --> 00:27:25,938
- Forced labor? Okay.
- Really.

345
00:27:26,021 --> 00:27:28,482
So people can just, like, self-imprison?

346
00:27:28,565 --> 00:27:30,067
Are you captive right now?

347
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:34,363
No, seriously, because your past self
chose to walk you down here

348
00:27:34,446 --> 00:27:36,907
to be an infantilizing prick to people.

349
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:39,785
Severance is subjugation, asshole.

350
00:27:40,786 --> 00:27:42,621
That's nice language for a...

351
00:27:42,704 --> 00:27:44,122
What... What are you? Twelve?

352
00:27:44,206 --> 00:27:47,084
Are you 12 years old?
Are you even in high school yet?

353
00:27:49,753 --> 00:27:51,255
Okay. Come on.

354
00:28:21,952 --> 00:28:22,953
Mrs. Selvig.

355
00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:24,746
Peace offering.

356
00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:26,790
Are we fighting?

357
00:28:26,874 --> 00:28:30,002
I just keep thinking
about those damn bins.

358
00:28:30,961 --> 00:28:35,382
Well, that is so not necessary,
but very kind. Thank you.

359
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,221
Here, why don't you
come in? I have milk.

360
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,682
- Why, thank you!
- Yeah.

361
00:28:46,018 --> 00:28:49,855
I'm experimenting with chamomile,
so no hard feelings if you gag.

362
00:28:49,938 --> 00:28:51,106
I'm sure I won't.

363
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:58,030
Still waiting for that third bulb
to revive itself?

364
00:28:58,113 --> 00:29:01,158
Oh, yeah. Keep
forgetting to change that.

365
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:04,786
My, you smell nice. Were you on a date?

366
00:29:05,829 --> 00:29:12,753
Sort of. My sister set me up with,
like, her doula, or midwife.

367
00:29:12,836 --> 00:29:14,505
Didn't really feel like anything.

368
00:29:19,885 --> 00:29:22,262
Well, let's see here. I'll...

369
00:29:32,064 --> 00:29:33,190
Wow.

370
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:35,150
This i... These are magic.

371
00:29:39,446 --> 00:29:41,281
My late husband was a carpenter,

372
00:29:41,365 --> 00:29:42,824
and before he passed,

373
00:29:42,908 --> 00:29:47,788
he said he would start building us
a house in the hereafter.

374
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:52,292
And there would be
a small guest apartment in the back,

375
00:29:52,376 --> 00:29:55,337
in case I found a new man
before I got there.

376
00:29:58,966 --> 00:30:00,843
That's... so sweet.

377
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:07,516
Yes. He even drew blueprints,
which I keep in my purse.

378
00:30:13,063 --> 00:30:14,648
Well, come by the shop, okay?

379
00:30:14,731 --> 00:30:19,319
I'll give you a mugwort bath bomb
that'll make you sleep like a rag doll.

380
00:30:19,403 --> 00:30:20,863
I'll try to get down there.

381
00:30:21,947 --> 00:30:23,448
Good night, Mrs. Selvig.

382
00:31:19,922 --> 00:31:21,924
The nerve, my new partner's a woman.

383
00:31:22,007 --> 00:31:24,259
I just think
you could've mentioned it sooner.

384
00:31:24,343 --> 00:31:28,931
You'd better be on the stakeout
and not... out for a steak.

385
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,868
Seth Milchick, Lumon Industries.

386
00:32:30,951 --> 00:32:33,036
Mr. Milchick, it's Mark Scout.

387
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,081
I'm a severed worker.
Employee number 4502.

388
00:32:36,164 --> 00:32:39,168
Mr. Scout, what a pleasure.
How can I help you?

389
00:32:39,251 --> 00:32:41,712
I actually woke up
not feeling terribly well.

390
00:32:41,795 --> 00:32:43,380
I'm sorry I'm just now calling.

391
00:32:44,047 --> 00:32:47,176
Oh, no. May I ask how serious it is?

392
00:32:47,259 --> 00:32:51,930
Well, nothing bad,
just very minor stomach event.

393
00:32:52,014 --> 00:32:53,307
Should be back tomorrow.

394
00:32:54,391 --> 00:32:55,517
Well, I'm sorry.

395
00:32:55,601 --> 00:32:58,228
I know your innie will be sad
to have missed the day.

396
00:33:00,522 --> 00:33:02,983
You feel better. Okay, Mr. Scout?

397
00:33:07,946 --> 00:33:10,324
- Where's Mark?
- Missed you too.

398
00:33:10,407 --> 00:33:13,327
He should be coming down first now.
You don't think that...

399
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:16,055
He's probably sick. They wouldn't
bounce him and Petey the same week.

400
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:17,414
I certainly hope not.

401
00:33:17,497 --> 00:33:18,916
Quarterly deadline's coming up,

402
00:33:18,999 --> 00:33:21,502
and I'm not looking
to be department chief.

403
00:33:21,585 --> 00:33:25,422
Wow. Lot a confidence for a man
who once got disciplined for dozing.

404
00:33:27,841 --> 00:33:29,343
Sorry. That was...

405
00:33:32,137 --> 00:33:35,182
I can't help
that I was hired older than you.

406
00:33:37,976 --> 00:33:39,603
It just never stops, huh?

407
00:33:39,686 --> 00:33:40,938
Endless toil.

408
00:33:42,272 --> 00:33:43,398
Where's Mark?

409
00:33:43,482 --> 00:33:45,651
Sick or fired. Probably sick.

410
00:33:46,151 --> 00:33:48,296
They wouldn't have fired him
for my note thing, would they?

411
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,031
No. No way. He did his stint
in the break room yesterday.

412
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,370
He said he was ill.

413
00:33:56,954 --> 00:33:58,163
Did he sound ill?

414
00:33:58,247 --> 00:34:00,499
I don't know. He said it was abdominal.

415
00:34:02,042 --> 00:34:03,210
Funny timing.

416
00:34:44,877 --> 00:34:47,963
The erasers are mostly decorative,
since we don't have pencils.

417
00:34:48,045 --> 00:34:50,441
Finger trap is fun, as long as
you know how to use it safely.

418
00:34:50,465 --> 00:34:53,594
But it's really more about what they
represent, how far you got in the file.

419
00:34:54,261 --> 00:34:57,261
- But why don't we always finish the files?
- 'Cause they only keep so long.

420
00:34:57,806 --> 00:35:01,185
You know, we finish, on average,
one in five files before they expire.

421
00:35:01,268 --> 00:35:04,938
Which is better than it used to be
before Mark's freshman fluke.

422
00:35:05,022 --> 00:35:06,273
What's a freshman fluke?

423
00:36:05,332 --> 00:36:06,416
No!

424
00:36:07,251 --> 00:36:08,252
Irv?

425
00:36:11,129 --> 00:36:12,464
I'm... I'm sorry.

426
00:36:13,257 --> 00:36:14,299
Irving?

427
00:37:17,404 --> 00:37:20,490
We'll deduct the time you spent dozing
from your outie's paycheck.

428
00:37:20,991 --> 00:37:24,661
What will be harder to fix, Irving,
is my and Ms. Cobel's trust in you.

429
00:37:25,204 --> 00:37:28,081
I'm so sorry, sir. I'm just so sorry.

430
00:37:28,165 --> 00:37:31,126
Well, no one is hankering
to throw you in the break room.

431
00:37:31,835 --> 00:37:34,922
We'll do a wellness check with Ms. Casey
and go from there, all right?

432
00:37:35,422 --> 00:37:36,840
Thank you, Mr. Milchick.

433
00:37:59,404 --> 00:38:00,656
Nothing scary yet.

434
00:38:09,957 --> 00:38:11,291
Oh, God! A four!

435
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:12,543
Don't fuck around.

436
00:38:13,085 --> 00:38:16,338
I told you, you'll understand
when you see it, so just be patient.

437
00:38:16,964 --> 00:38:18,423
What even are these numbers?

438
00:38:18,507 --> 00:38:20,884
Like, do we even know
what we're supposedly cleaning?

439
00:38:23,262 --> 00:38:24,263
My theory?

440
00:38:25,973 --> 00:38:26,974
The sea.

441
00:38:29,268 --> 00:38:30,269
The sea?

442
00:38:30,978 --> 00:38:32,437
Yeah. Think about it.

443
00:38:32,521 --> 00:38:35,649
Okay, if our outies are up there
severing their brains,

444
00:38:35,732 --> 00:38:37,526
shit must have gotten pretty bad.

445
00:38:37,609 --> 00:38:40,279
Famine, plagues, et cetera.

446
00:38:40,362 --> 00:38:43,574
So what is a desperate humanity to do?

447
00:38:46,034 --> 00:38:47,035
Populate the sea?

448
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:48,495
Populate the sea.

449
00:38:48,579 --> 00:38:52,332
But first, they gotta send probes
down to the sea to clean up

450
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:55,878
all the deadly eels and shit,
'cause we can't cohabitate with that.

451
00:38:56,378 --> 00:38:59,882
So we send the probes down,
they send us the data coded,

452
00:38:59,965 --> 00:39:04,511
we sense what's eels, and then
we tell the probes what to blow up.

453
00:39:08,015 --> 00:39:09,266
This is the leading theory?

454
00:39:11,226 --> 00:39:14,313
Nah, Irv thinks we're cutting
swear words out of movies.

455
00:39:18,775 --> 00:39:22,362
But what is it? Like, what... what
are we actually workin' on down there?

456
00:39:24,448 --> 00:39:25,449
I don't know.

457
00:39:26,742 --> 00:39:29,328
I thought without severance
it would make more sense, but...

458
00:39:31,163 --> 00:39:33,832
They separate us
from the other departments.

459
00:39:33,916 --> 00:39:35,751
We don't even know how many there are.

460
00:39:40,255 --> 00:39:42,508
But I've been reintegrated
for two weeks now.

461
00:39:45,135 --> 00:39:46,887
I've been mapping out the floor.

462
00:39:58,607 --> 00:40:00,984
I hid the original for you when I left.

463
00:40:20,963 --> 00:40:22,089
You okay?

464
00:40:30,222 --> 00:40:31,223
Sorry.

465
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:33,892
Reintegration sickness.

466
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,188
Never heard of that one.

467
00:40:38,981 --> 00:40:41,400
Because I'm the first dipshit
that's ever had it.

468
00:40:42,693 --> 00:40:46,530
Plus, living in a cold-ass greenhouse
doesn't help, but I can't go home.

469
00:40:49,658 --> 00:40:53,787
Okay, so what is it that happens
down there that's so bad?

470
00:40:57,666 --> 00:40:58,667
There's this room...

471
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:07,759
We go in there when we don't act right.

472
00:41:15,517 --> 00:41:16,643
What is that?

473
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:24,943
I'm afraid you're not sorry.

474
00:41:26,069 --> 00:41:30,282
Please. I truly am. I'm sorry.

475
00:41:30,365 --> 00:41:32,034
Please read the statement again.

476
00:41:33,994 --> 00:41:38,415
Forgive me for the harm
I have caused this world.

477
00:41:38,498 --> 00:41:44,338
None may atone for my actions but me,
and only in me shall their stain live on.

478
00:41:44,421 --> 00:41:46,632
I am thankful to have been caught,

479
00:41:46,715 --> 00:41:50,802
my fall cut short
by those with wizened hands.

480
00:41:51,678 --> 00:41:55,307
All I can be is sorry,
and that is all that I am.

481
00:41:56,475 --> 00:42:00,896
I'm afraid you don't mean it.
Again, please.

482
00:42:02,439 --> 00:42:07,069
Forgive me for the harm
I have caused this world.

483
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:11,865
None may atone for my actions but me.

484
00:42:15,327 --> 00:42:16,662
The fuck is that?

485
00:42:19,081 --> 00:42:20,332
That's the break room.

486
00:42:53,448 --> 00:42:54,700
I'm... I'm sorry.

487
00:42:54,783 --> 00:42:56,034
No, I'm sorry, sir.

488
00:42:56,118 --> 00:42:58,328
I didn't think anybody was out here.

489
00:42:58,412 --> 00:43:01,206
I'm coming out from my session.

490
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:06,587
I was just going in.
I was admiring the art while I wait.

491
00:43:07,462 --> 00:43:11,133
That piece hung in the perpetuity wing
for many years.

492
00:43:11,216 --> 00:43:14,094
I know. And it broke my heart
when they took it down.

493
00:43:14,678 --> 00:43:16,972
It's better here. It's calming.

494
00:43:20,184 --> 00:43:22,895
I'm Irving. Macrodata Refinement.

495
00:43:23,478 --> 00:43:24,938
Are you a department head?

496
00:43:25,022 --> 00:43:26,940
Well, Optics and Design.

497
00:43:27,691 --> 00:43:30,152
A two-person department, so, barely.

498
00:43:30,235 --> 00:43:31,653
So this is your work?

499
00:43:32,446 --> 00:43:35,199
We don't paint them. We do hang them.

500
00:43:35,282 --> 00:43:40,495
I loved that you did the Ambrose cycle
in the team-building space last quarter.

501
00:43:41,038 --> 00:43:42,956
I'd never seen it.

502
00:43:43,457 --> 00:43:45,959
Well, it's rare to meet a sophisticate.

503
00:43:46,877 --> 00:43:50,881
Most people only think of O&D
when new handbook totes come in.

504
00:43:51,924 --> 00:43:53,717
Well, I love those too.

505
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,177
Yeah?

506
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:57,638
There's new ones coming next month.

507
00:43:58,597 --> 00:44:00,390
Best design yet, in my view.

508
00:44:01,433 --> 00:44:05,437
Wow! Well, that's all
I'll be thinking about until then.

509
00:44:06,063 --> 00:44:07,063
Irving?

510
00:44:45,352 --> 00:44:46,645
All right, Irving.

511
00:44:47,479 --> 00:44:51,400
What I'd like to do is share with you
some facts about your outie.

512
00:44:52,985 --> 00:44:58,991
Because your outie is an exemplary person,
these facts should be very pleasing.

513
00:45:00,659 --> 00:45:04,663
Just relax your body
and be open to the facts.

514
00:45:05,455 --> 00:45:08,584
Try to enjoy each equally.

515
00:45:09,918 --> 00:45:13,130
These facts are not to be shared
outside this room.

516
00:45:14,673 --> 00:45:17,885
But for now, they're yours to enjoy.

517
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:25,350
Your outie is generous.

518
00:45:27,978 --> 00:45:31,899
Your outie is fond of music
and owns many records.

519
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:39,448
Your outie is a friend to children
and to the elderly and the insane.

520
00:45:41,491 --> 00:45:45,704
Your outie is strong
and helped someone lift a heavy object.

521
00:45:47,748 --> 00:45:53,420
Your outie attends many dances and
is popular among the other attendees.

522
00:45:54,755 --> 00:46:01,720
Your outie likes films
and owns a machine that can play them.

523
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:08,894
Your outie is splendid
and can swim gracefully and well.

524
00:46:10,395 --> 00:46:11,605
I'm sorry.

525
00:46:12,481 --> 00:46:15,067
Please try to enjoy each fact equally,

526
00:46:15,734 --> 00:46:18,403
and not show preference
for any over the others.

527
00:46:18,987 --> 00:46:21,990
That's ten points off.
You have 90 points remaining.

528
00:46:22,074 --> 00:46:24,284
- Points?
- Please don't speak.

529
00:46:32,042 --> 00:46:34,628
Your outie won a game two weeks ago.

530
00:46:36,046 --> 00:46:38,632
Your outie values water.

531
00:46:39,925 --> 00:46:44,638
A photo of your outie with a trophy
was once in a newspaper.

532
00:46:46,265 --> 00:46:50,602
Your outie has no fear
of muggers or knaves.

533
00:46:52,563 --> 00:46:55,607
Your outie likes the sound of radar.

534
00:46:58,193 --> 00:47:03,073
Your outie is skilled
at kissing and lovemaking.

535
00:47:05,909 --> 00:47:06,910
I'm sorry.

536
00:47:06,994 --> 00:47:09,913
Please don't respond
to any specific fact.

537
00:47:09,997 --> 00:47:11,790
That's ten points off.

538
00:47:11,874 --> 00:47:14,084
- I was just...
- Please don't speak further,

539
00:47:14,168 --> 00:47:18,005
or all remaining points will be deducted
and the wellness session will end.

540
00:47:35,772 --> 00:47:36,815
Okay.

541
00:47:57,753 --> 00:47:59,254
- Is it just the elevators?
- What?

542
00:47:59,338 --> 00:48:01,673
With the code detectors.
Or is it the stairwells too?

543
00:48:01,757 --> 00:48:03,675
Jesus. Stairwells too. Why?

544
00:48:03,759 --> 00:48:05,969
If no one accepts the resignations,

545
00:48:06,053 --> 00:48:07,906
what makes you think
they're being delivered at all?

546
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:10,224
You gotta let
the info-smuggling notion go.

547
00:48:10,307 --> 00:48:11,618
Okay, but how good are the scanners?

548
00:48:11,642 --> 00:48:14,811
Like, what if you wrote the letters
funky, like one of those robot tests?

549
00:48:14,895 --> 00:48:16,772
- Hi, kids. What's for dinner?
- Nope!

550
00:48:16,855 --> 00:48:18,106
How was wellness?

551
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:20,067
Great. Very restorative.

552
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:21,944
I met the O&D department head.

553
00:48:22,027 --> 00:48:26,198
Burt? I've met that guy. He's a fuck. You
didn't tell him where we are, did you?

554
00:48:26,281 --> 00:48:28,367
Burt's not a fuck. And no.

555
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:30,577
I'm asking for the safety
of this department.

556
00:48:30,661 --> 00:48:32,180
- I don't need to tell you...
- That's a myth.

557
00:48:32,204 --> 00:48:34,098
And don't pretend you care
about this department.

558
00:48:34,122 --> 00:48:35,749
You just want your waffle party.

559
00:48:35,832 --> 00:48:38,794
Beg-fucking-pardon.
We're supposed to like the perks.

560
00:48:38,877 --> 00:48:42,881
"And all in Lumon's care shall revel
in the bounty of the incentives spur."

561
00:48:42,965 --> 00:48:45,676
Don't pervert a handbook passage
to me, okay?

562
00:48:45,759 --> 00:48:46,927
- Don't do it.
- Hey, guys?

563
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:48,905
Lumon has been good to us,
and it is feckless to...

564
00:48:48,929 --> 00:48:49,930
Guys!

565
00:48:58,480 --> 00:48:59,731
That.

566
00:49:00,524 --> 00:49:01,525
Yep.

567
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:03,694
Why is... Why is it...

568
00:49:03,777 --> 00:49:06,488
You okay. Just fence off
the bad data like I showed you.

569
00:49:06,572 --> 00:49:08,448
Can you see the perimeter?

570
00:49:17,624 --> 00:49:19,042
And bin it.

571
00:49:31,263 --> 00:49:33,140
Boom. Fucking refined.

572
00:49:33,223 --> 00:49:35,392
All right, Helly. Hip, hip.

573
00:49:36,143 --> 00:49:39,146
They were scary. The numbers were scary.

574
00:49:56,997 --> 00:50:00,375
Here's the couch.
I'll find you a sleeping bag.

575
00:50:01,251 --> 00:50:04,671
And you can use the shower if you want.

576
00:50:05,422 --> 00:50:06,840
What are you trying to say?

577
00:50:11,845 --> 00:50:13,138
Thanks for doing this, Mark.

578
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,517
Well, I, you know, figured my work self
would be pissed

579
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,185
if I let you sleep in a greenhouse.

580
00:50:24,316 --> 00:50:25,317
Light's on the left.

581
00:50:53,011 --> 00:50:54,179
You okay in there?

582
00:50:54,263 --> 00:50:56,557
Yeah! Yeah, I'm good.

583
00:52:09,546 --> 00:52:10,672
Petey, are you okay?
