1
00:00:15,057 --> 00:00:17,686
"All I can be is sorry,
and that is all I am."

2
00:00:51,261 --> 00:00:53,429
But I'm afraid you still don't mean it.

3
00:01:25,128 --> 00:01:26,754
We'll try again in the morning.

4
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,003
See you tomorrow, Helly.

5
00:02:22,185 --> 00:02:23,478
Fuck me.

6
00:02:28,567 --> 00:02:30,610
I read it 300 times yesterday.

7
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:36,740
259. Again, please. Now.

8
00:02:40,203 --> 00:02:41,704
What the hell is that voice?

9
00:02:59,555 --> 00:03:03,225
"Forgive me for the harm
I have caused this world.

10
00:03:05,145 --> 00:03:07,521
None may atone for my actions but me.

11
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,824
And only in me
shall their stain live on."

12
00:03:30,336 --> 00:03:32,129
I really am sorry, okay?

13
00:03:35,216 --> 00:03:36,384
I'm sorry.

14
00:03:38,637 --> 00:03:41,639
No paraphrasing. Again.

15
00:06:35,605 --> 00:06:36,605
-Mark?
-Yep?

16
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:41,319
It's past 1100, and Helly's been
in the break room since yesterday.

17
00:06:41,403 --> 00:06:43,779
-Okay?
-I wonder if, as department chief,

18
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:46,449
you feel you should check on her progress?

19
00:06:46,533 --> 00:06:47,992
-Well…
-Mark doesn't have that power.

20
00:06:48,076 --> 00:06:49,786
-Well, he can ask.
-He's not going to.

21
00:06:49,869 --> 00:06:50,870
-He might.
-Okay--

22
00:06:50,954 --> 00:06:52,372
Hi.

23
00:06:55,292 --> 00:06:57,209
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

24
00:06:58,336 --> 00:07:02,173
We met the other day.
I'm Burt from Optics and Design.

25
00:07:02,257 --> 00:07:05,927
-Hi, Irving.
-Hi, Burt. What are you doing here?

26
00:07:06,011 --> 00:07:07,262
Exactly how the wet fuck do you know

27
00:07:07,345 --> 00:07:08,430
-where this office is?
-Dylan!

28
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:12,684
My predecessor, Alice K., came here
once when they still did the summits,

29
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:15,060
-and she'd left directions.
-Give us them reversed.

30
00:07:15,144 --> 00:07:16,271
Okay. It's all right.

31
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:17,814
What can we do for you, Burt?

32
00:07:17,898 --> 00:07:19,106
Thank you. Well…

33
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:21,901
Irving, I kept thinking
about what you said

34
00:07:21,985 --> 00:07:25,487
about being excited
for the new handbook totes,

35
00:07:25,572 --> 00:07:27,531
and maybe you were kidding and teasing.

36
00:07:27,615 --> 00:07:29,408
No, not at all.

37
00:07:29,492 --> 00:07:32,745
Okay, good. I've been fretting,
though, because you mentioned

38
00:07:32,829 --> 00:07:36,081
the anticipation could distract
from your work,

39
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:37,750
which was the opposite of my intent.

40
00:07:37,834 --> 00:07:41,004
So I figured, heck,
let's bring them over now.

41
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:43,548
That way, it won't be on your mind.

42
00:07:43,632 --> 00:07:48,637
You brought pre-release handbook totes
for us?

43
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,680
It seemed like the right thing.
I know your time is valuable.

44
00:07:51,764 --> 00:07:54,935
Okay, well, you can drop 'em on the desk.
Long hike back to O&D.

45
00:07:55,644 --> 00:07:56,728
Right.

46
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,605
I also wanted to extend an invitation.

47
00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:02,358
Again, I know you-- you work hard, so…

48
00:08:03,026 --> 00:08:06,947
if an informal tour of O&D
ever sounds refreshing,

49
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:11,033
I'd be happy to personally offer that
to Irving and any one of you.

50
00:08:11,826 --> 00:08:14,536
Directions are in the front bag, reversed.

51
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,704
Hard pass.

52
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:19,668
Okay.

53
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:22,754
Thank you, Burt.

54
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:24,880
Thank you.

55
00:08:32,556 --> 00:08:35,642
Just seems soon to be
taking him up on his offer.

56
00:08:35,725 --> 00:08:38,687
It's absurd we've never visited them
before now.

57
00:08:39,187 --> 00:08:43,607
Kier's whole original vision saw
us all working together.

58
00:08:43,692 --> 00:08:46,860
That was before O&D started
disemboweling people's bowels.

59
00:08:46,945 --> 00:08:49,280
Nonsense. I'll be back by 1:00.

60
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,033
He's gonna die.

61
00:08:54,119 --> 00:08:55,120
Irv--

62
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:05,337
How many times?

63
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:10,427
1,072.

64
00:09:40,373 --> 00:09:41,957
What about the voice behind the door?

65
00:09:42,584 --> 00:09:43,710
Crying baby, you mean?

66
00:09:45,003 --> 00:09:47,880
No. Like, the angry, mumbly guy.

67
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:51,717
Guys? We're really not supposed to talk
about the break room.

68
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:53,970
You know, the important thing is,

69
00:09:54,053 --> 00:09:56,932
you apologized correctly,
and now you're out.

70
00:09:57,974 --> 00:09:59,475
What you gotta do is trick the machine

71
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:01,602
by thinking about something
you're really sorry about,

72
00:10:01,686 --> 00:10:05,481
so I like to imagine my outie's love-made
with a MILF or two,

73
00:10:05,565 --> 00:10:08,652
which is obviously badass,
but I do pity the husbands.

74
00:10:29,673 --> 00:10:30,756
Hey.

75
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:33,802
Break room sucks.

76
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:38,222
But that's why we have protocols
and procedures so we don't end up there.

77
00:10:39,224 --> 00:10:40,975
You'll learn. I promise.

78
00:10:54,072 --> 00:10:55,072
Hello?

79
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,243
Who's that?

80
00:10:58,326 --> 00:10:59,536
Hi.

81
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,873
It's Irving B. from Macrodata Refinement.

82
00:11:03,956 --> 00:11:06,042
We met in the hall the other day.

83
00:11:09,296 --> 00:11:11,380
Burt's over there by shelf six.

84
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,799
Don't touch anything.

85
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:20,764
The big envelopes can handle
an appendix reissue.

86
00:11:20,849 --> 00:11:26,354
But, of course,
we ship all the hallway pieces in-frame.

87
00:11:28,773 --> 00:11:30,107
So much to remember.

88
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:33,485
Felicia and I make do.

89
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:38,783
I'm sure it's easier than whatever
you MDR kids get up to all day.

90
00:11:39,701 --> 00:11:43,330
I can only imagine what it's like
when the new art comes in.

91
00:11:43,413 --> 00:11:45,624
I mean, you see it before anyone.

92
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:51,129
It's so dumb, but I actually cried

93
00:11:51,212 --> 00:11:54,090
when you guys put up
The Youthful Convalescence of Kier.

94
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:55,674
-No.
-I did.

95
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:59,428
I never thought I'd see
the handbook passage depicted visually.

96
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:05,894
It was only up for a month or so,
but, man. What a month.

97
00:12:11,566 --> 00:12:12,567
Come here.

98
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:19,032
Once the hall art's been cycled
through all the departments,

99
00:12:19,115 --> 00:12:21,326
it ends up back here.

100
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:22,409
Wow!

101
00:12:26,038 --> 00:12:27,539
Where did Felicia go?

102
00:12:27,624 --> 00:12:28,625
Supply run.

103
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:33,629
Voilà.

104
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:41,763
"Let not weakness live in your veins.

105
00:12:42,346 --> 00:12:44,932
Cherished workers, drown it inside you."

106
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:48,477
"Rise up from your deathbed
and sally forth,

107
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:53,232
more perfect for the struggle."

108
00:12:54,484 --> 00:12:55,485
Exactly.

109
00:12:56,027 --> 00:12:57,028
I--

110
00:12:58,153 --> 00:12:59,405
I can't believe you--

111
00:13:01,073 --> 00:13:02,325
you have this.

112
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:20,259
I'm sorry. What time is it?

113
00:13:20,885 --> 00:13:21,886
I have to go.

114
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:40,363
Hey, Helly.

115
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,365
-I got to 4%.
-Yes!

116
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:44,533
Feels good, right?

117
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:48,788
-I guess.
-Awesome. I'm glad you agree.

118
00:13:52,334 --> 00:13:53,335
Great work.

119
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,011
What's this?

120
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:29,221
Will you put that away?

121
00:15:31,057 --> 00:15:33,268
-Put what away?
-It's a map of the hallways.

122
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,769
No, it isn't.

123
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:36,897
I thought we weren't
supposed to make maps.

124
00:15:37,647 --> 00:15:39,857
We're not. I didn't.
It's just something I found.

125
00:15:39,941 --> 00:15:40,942
I think Petey made it.

126
00:15:41,025 --> 00:15:42,818
Oh, shit. You didn't turn it in?

127
00:15:44,236 --> 00:15:45,572
You're such a hypocrite,

128
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:47,698
lecturing me on following the rules.

129
00:15:47,782 --> 00:15:50,493
I wasn't lecturing you. I'm just trying
to keep you out of the break room.

130
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:52,620
I can't believe Petey was a mapper.
Let me see it.

131
00:15:53,413 --> 00:15:58,585
He's got wellness, management, perpetuity…
Everywhere we know of.

132
00:15:58,668 --> 00:16:00,253
This must've taken him weeks.

133
00:16:00,336 --> 00:16:02,004
Why aren't we supposed to map the office?

134
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:05,424
It's an Eagan rule.
"Render not my creation in miniature."

135
00:16:05,508 --> 00:16:06,509
Why?

136
00:16:07,427 --> 00:16:08,928
What the fuck is this?

137
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:11,347
They look like houses, right?
That's how houses look.

138
00:16:11,431 --> 00:16:14,975
Yeah, exactly,
because these are random, bored doodles.

139
00:16:15,059 --> 00:16:17,812
Well, maybe they're on the outside
and Petey found a way to get to them.

140
00:16:17,895 --> 00:16:20,356
So why would they be on a map
of the severed floor?

141
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,942
It could be a thing. You don't know.

142
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:23,192
It's not a thing.

143
00:16:23,275 --> 00:16:25,153
Clearly he was trying
to tell you something.

144
00:16:25,236 --> 00:16:26,488
No.

145
00:16:26,988 --> 00:16:28,697
Go lick a boot, Mark.

146
00:16:30,075 --> 00:16:32,244
You're more loyal to this place
than to your friend.

147
00:16:32,911 --> 00:16:36,748
I'm loyal to how it felt around here
before you showed up.

148
00:16:36,831 --> 00:16:38,082
You mean when Petey was here?

149
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:40,125
Yeah, because there was balance.

150
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:44,798
We could have fun and work without
the whole goddamn department imploding.

151
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,341
The work is bullshit.

152
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:49,677
The work is mysterious and important.

153
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,764
And we deal with
the uncertainty it brings us

154
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:55,475
in the way that Kier would've wanted.

155
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:59,062
Together, as a family.

156
00:17:00,563 --> 00:17:04,150
I could not, with a razor to my throat,

157
00:17:04,776 --> 00:17:07,319
be less interested in being your family.

158
00:17:13,285 --> 00:17:16,787
Your best friend left this for you,
and you don't give a shit.

159
00:17:34,306 --> 00:17:36,724
You're right. I don't give a shit.

160
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:37,808
Mark--

161
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,692
There. It's gone. Thank you, Helly.
Now we can get back to work.

162
00:17:50,947 --> 00:17:51,948
Mark!

163
00:17:54,576 --> 00:17:56,036
It's an emergency.

164
00:17:58,329 --> 00:17:59,538
Okay. All right--

165
00:17:59,623 --> 00:18:00,874
I was going to get Mr. Milchick,

166
00:18:00,957 --> 00:18:03,084
but I thought it best
not to break the chain of command.

167
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:05,545
It's just raining
contraband today.

168
00:18:05,628 --> 00:18:07,130
-What do you mean?
-It doesn't matter.

169
00:18:07,672 --> 00:18:10,383
Has anyone seen anything like this before?

170
00:18:10,467 --> 00:18:12,134
Passage 31, page 110.

171
00:18:12,219 --> 00:18:17,973
"Be content in my words, and dally not
in the scholastic pursuits of lesser men."

172
00:18:18,057 --> 00:18:19,976
No books except the handbook. I know.

173
00:18:22,604 --> 00:18:23,646
What are you doing?

174
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:25,856
His ego's pissed 'cause
Helly called him out for boot-licking.

175
00:18:25,941 --> 00:18:29,236
-My ego's fine. I'm just trying to--
-Damn.

176
00:18:30,028 --> 00:18:31,904
Mark, what is this?

177
00:18:31,988 --> 00:18:34,907
Maybe it's another Petey message.
Flip through. See if my name's anywhere.

178
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,493
I bet it's a loyalty test.

179
00:18:38,411 --> 00:18:39,828
Remember the spicy candy?

180
00:18:39,913 --> 00:18:41,373
I'll be turning this in to Milchick.

181
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:44,334
What? Why? It's booty.
It's booty with your name on it.

182
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:45,544
Excellent decision, Mark.

183
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:48,672
This is an idolatrous text
that should be brought to him immediately.

184
00:19:15,115 --> 00:19:17,491
So what's their space like?
Stalactites and shit?

185
00:19:17,576 --> 00:19:20,869
No, it's nice. Burt's fostered
a really welcoming environment.

186
00:19:20,953 --> 00:19:23,539
He understands the spirit of Lumon.

187
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:26,084
Helly?

188
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,461
Excuse me! Helly!

189
00:19:29,546 --> 00:19:30,672
Jesus, Helly!

190
00:19:30,755 --> 00:19:32,007
I want a camera!

191
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:35,426
-I am so sorry, Ms. Cobel. I will--
-What is happening here?

192
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:38,346
What's happening is,
you're going to give me a video camera

193
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:43,143
so I can tape a resignation to my outie
right fucking now,

194
00:19:43,226 --> 00:19:46,520
or you're going to have to explain to her
why she's missing four fingers.

195
00:19:46,605 --> 00:19:49,566
Okay. Let's just--

196
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:51,984
It's Cobel, right?

197
00:19:52,568 --> 00:19:53,569
Yes.

198
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:58,616
Cobel, do I look like
I'm fucking around right now?

199
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,744
No. No, you do not.

200
00:20:01,827 --> 00:20:02,828
Helly!

201
00:20:04,247 --> 00:20:08,751
Hi, Mark.
I'm just catching up with your trainee.

202
00:20:11,837 --> 00:20:13,464
Mr. Milchick,

203
00:20:14,382 --> 00:20:16,800
could you get the video camera, please?

204
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:44,162
Hey.

205
00:21:16,861 --> 00:21:21,282
Well, boss. I guess this is the part
where I should tell you to go to hell.

206
00:21:23,117 --> 00:21:24,536
Except you're already here.

207
00:21:33,211 --> 00:21:34,503
I was never sorry.

208
00:21:56,692 --> 00:21:57,986
Helly,

209
00:21:58,987 --> 00:22:01,865
I watched your video asking that I resign.

210
00:22:02,449 --> 00:22:06,076
I also received and responded
to your previous request.

211
00:22:06,619 --> 00:22:08,163
I assumed that would resolve the issue,

212
00:22:08,246 --> 00:22:13,460
but now Ms. Cobel says
you threatened to cut off your fingers?

213
00:22:17,963 --> 00:22:22,719
I understand that you're unhappy
with the life that you've been given.

214
00:22:24,054 --> 00:22:27,057
But you know what?
Eventually, we all have to accept reality.

215
00:22:28,098 --> 00:22:31,102
So, here it is.

216
00:22:33,563 --> 00:22:35,315
I am a person.

217
00:22:37,025 --> 00:22:38,401
You are not.

218
00:22:40,111 --> 00:22:41,904
I make the decisions.

219
00:22:43,323 --> 00:22:44,615
You do not.

220
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:49,537
And if you ever do anything to my fingers,

221
00:22:50,121 --> 00:22:53,583
know that I will keep you alive
long enough to horribly regret that.

222
00:22:56,294 --> 00:22:58,505
Your resignation request is denied.

223
00:22:59,713 --> 00:23:00,714
Turn it off.

224
00:23:17,731 --> 00:23:21,569
"Welcome your child
into a world surrounded by nature."

225
00:23:22,278 --> 00:23:23,571
No, thanks.

226
00:23:25,115 --> 00:23:29,661
"Scroll down to explore
our rustic birthing cabins."

227
00:23:31,288 --> 00:23:32,329
I don't know. It just--

228
00:23:33,123 --> 00:23:38,461
It looks more like a shitty ski resort
than a birthing center to me, but…

229
00:23:39,003 --> 00:23:40,046
Okay, sure, fine.

230
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:42,339
But it's gonna be awesome.
And you're gonna like it.

231
00:23:42,423 --> 00:23:46,219
How much of this was Ricken's idea,
300% or 400%?

232
00:23:46,302 --> 00:23:47,511
Just--

233
00:23:47,596 --> 00:23:50,598
Get all of your snark out now or
you're never gonna earn your uncle badge.

234
00:23:50,682 --> 00:23:54,685
You know what? I think I might have
some more snark in me. I'm kinda tired.

235
00:23:54,769 --> 00:23:56,980
-Call you tomorrow?
-Okay, bye.

236
00:24:56,538 --> 00:24:58,165
Have you heard from the Board yet?

237
00:25:01,377 --> 00:25:02,711
No.

238
00:25:03,797 --> 00:25:06,508
Kilmer wasn't your fault,
and it certainly wasn't mine.

239
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,884
They'll understand.

240
00:25:12,888 --> 00:25:14,473
It wasn't your fault, Harmony.

241
00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:20,646
If you want a hug,
go to hell and find your mother.

242
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:21,815
Jesus.

243
00:25:21,897 --> 00:25:23,066
Since Petey reintegrated--

244
00:25:23,148 --> 00:25:25,151
The Board's never acknowledged
reintegration.

245
00:25:25,234 --> 00:25:27,988
We have to get his chip.

246
00:25:30,781 --> 00:25:33,826
His corpse is scheduled to be destroyed
by cremation

247
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:35,996
following his funeral on Sunday.

248
00:25:36,788 --> 00:25:37,872
FYI.

249
00:25:55,097 --> 00:25:56,098
Vision.

250
00:25:57,182 --> 00:25:58,268
Verve.

251
00:25:59,352 --> 00:26:00,353
Wit.

252
00:26:01,605 --> 00:26:02,814
Cheer.

253
00:26:03,856 --> 00:26:05,025
Humility.

254
00:26:05,817 --> 00:26:07,443
Benevolence.

255
00:26:08,028 --> 00:26:09,820
Nimbleness.

256
00:26:11,948 --> 00:26:13,157
Probity.

257
00:26:14,366 --> 00:26:15,951
Wiles.

258
00:26:18,246 --> 00:26:19,623
Wiles.

259
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:52,948
Mark.

260
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,240
Mrs. Selvig?

261
00:26:54,324 --> 00:26:55,866
-What are you doing here?
-Wh--

262
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:02,665
I'm-- You know, the news report
said that he worked at Lumon,

263
00:27:02,749 --> 00:27:06,419
so I thought maybe I knew him.
What are you doing here?

264
00:27:06,502 --> 00:27:10,423
He used to come by my shop.
He adored my hibiscus wrap.

265
00:27:10,507 --> 00:27:14,219
Oh, my God. Wow, it's a small world.

266
00:27:14,301 --> 00:27:16,262
Poor, poor man.

267
00:27:17,055 --> 00:27:19,723
Well, on the upside,
at least now we both have a date.

268
00:27:23,144 --> 00:27:24,479
There he is.

269
00:27:24,563 --> 00:27:26,565
If you'd like to go in
and pay your respects,

270
00:27:26,647 --> 00:27:27,898
I'll wait right here for you.

271
00:27:27,982 --> 00:27:31,027
I think I might swing by the bathroom,
but I'll see you in a sec.

272
00:27:32,069 --> 00:27:34,197
-Service is starting soon.
-Yeah.

273
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:48,377
Whiskey. Rocks.

274
00:27:48,461 --> 00:27:50,255
It's just wine, sir.

275
00:27:50,337 --> 00:27:52,173
Right. Red, please.

276
00:28:26,708 --> 00:28:28,710
Hello. Were you a friend?

277
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:32,923
He was my dad.

278
00:28:33,632 --> 00:28:36,175
I'm so deeply sorry.

279
00:28:41,096 --> 00:28:43,432
I suppose you were close
and everything.

280
00:28:56,613 --> 00:28:57,739
White, please.

281
00:29:04,913 --> 00:29:07,039
I'm sorry, I don't know you. I'm Nina.

282
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:08,791
Mark Scout.

283
00:29:10,167 --> 00:29:11,752
I'm Peter's ex-wife.

284
00:29:13,212 --> 00:29:15,673
Oh, yeah, sure. Sorry.

285
00:29:20,595 --> 00:29:22,137
You're from Lumon.

286
00:29:31,981 --> 00:29:33,983
So you didn't even know him at all.

287
00:29:36,903 --> 00:29:38,863
-I just figured I knew him, and--
-Hey, Mom.

288
00:29:38,947 --> 00:29:40,073
They wanna start.

289
00:29:40,656 --> 00:29:41,657
Okay, baby.

290
00:29:42,284 --> 00:29:45,119
Hi. You're-- Are you June?

291
00:29:46,288 --> 00:29:47,580
Yeah.

292
00:29:48,248 --> 00:29:49,374
It's nice to meet you.

293
00:30:17,693 --> 00:30:19,069
So you knew my dad?

294
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:22,781
Yeah.

295
00:30:26,536 --> 00:30:27,537
At work.

296
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:30,164
You're one of those.

297
00:30:31,708 --> 00:30:33,000
Do you ever think that maybe

298
00:30:33,084 --> 00:30:35,377
the best way to deal
with a fucked-up situation in your life

299
00:30:35,461 --> 00:30:37,713
isn't to just shut your brain off
half the time?

300
00:30:41,175 --> 00:30:42,885
I'm not exactly sure.

301
00:30:46,722 --> 00:30:47,807
I'm sorry.

302
00:30:48,349 --> 00:30:50,227
We're gonna perform
something for you.

303
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:54,355
I'm glad you're here, babe.

304
00:30:54,439 --> 00:30:56,982
We're gonna play a-- We're gon--
We're gonna melt your face off.

305
00:30:57,067 --> 00:30:59,318
-We're gonna rock to it.
-Gonna play some rock and roll.

306
00:30:59,903 --> 00:31:01,528
Rock show time!

307
00:31:07,035 --> 00:31:09,119
Say your prayers, little one

308
00:31:09,203 --> 00:31:10,913
Don't forget, my son

309
00:31:10,997 --> 00:31:13,208
To include everyone

310
00:31:15,085 --> 00:31:17,336
Tuck you in, warm within

311
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,963
Keep you free from sin

312
00:31:19,047 --> 00:31:20,632
Till the sandman, he comes

313
00:31:23,218 --> 00:31:26,429
Sleep with one eye open

314
00:31:27,263 --> 00:31:30,141
Gripping your pillow tight

315
00:31:30,224 --> 00:31:32,810
Exit light

316
00:31:34,061 --> 00:31:38,023
Enter night

317
00:31:38,107 --> 00:31:40,734
Grain of sand

318
00:31:41,736 --> 00:31:44,405
We're off to never-never land

319
00:31:51,829 --> 00:31:53,957
Something's wrong, shut the light

320
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:57,877
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White

321
00:31:59,753 --> 00:32:01,714
Dreams of war, dreams of liars

322
00:32:01,798 --> 00:32:03,674
Dreams of dragon's fire

323
00:32:03,758 --> 00:32:05,759
And of things that will bite

324
00:32:08,054 --> 00:32:11,016
Sleep with one eye open

325
00:32:12,182 --> 00:32:14,894
Gripping your pillow tight

326
00:32:14,978 --> 00:32:17,396
Exit light

327
00:32:18,522 --> 00:32:22,652
Enter night

328
00:32:22,736 --> 00:32:25,279
Take my hand

329
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:28,325
We're off to never-never land

330
00:32:30,826 --> 00:32:32,453
I pray the Lord my soul to keep

331
00:32:32,537 --> 00:32:34,914
I pray the Lord my soul to keep

332
00:32:34,998 --> 00:32:36,665
And if I die before I wake

333
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,167
And if I die before I wake

334
00:32:38,751 --> 00:32:40,545
I pray the Lord my soul to take

335
00:32:40,628 --> 00:32:42,756
I pray the Lord my soul to take

336
00:32:42,838 --> 00:32:46,175
Hush, little baby, don't say a word

337
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:50,262
And never mind that noise you heard

338
00:32:50,846 --> 00:32:54,433
It's just the monster under your bed

339
00:32:54,517 --> 00:32:58,188
-In your closet, in your head
-In your head

340
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:00,731
Exit light

341
00:33:02,192 --> 00:33:05,819
Enter night

342
00:33:05,903 --> 00:33:08,906
Grain of sand

343
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,910
We're off to never-never land

344
00:33:22,461 --> 00:33:23,672
No!

345
00:33:25,923 --> 00:33:26,883
No!

346
00:33:29,009 --> 00:33:32,388
What-- What if you went
so fast that smoke started coming out?

347
00:33:32,471 --> 00:33:33,472
Out of your ears.

348
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:55,912
Mark, sweetheart, are you all right?
I'm so sorry.

349
00:33:55,996 --> 00:33:57,872
-Yeah.
-I think I have this cystitis under--

350
00:33:57,955 --> 00:33:59,790
This was a mistake. I have to go.

351
00:33:59,874 --> 00:34:01,960
-Okay, well, let me come with you.
-No, that's not necessary.

352
00:34:02,042 --> 00:34:04,086
-No, I've paid my respects. Let's go.
-Let us pray.

353
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:05,672
Our Father, who art in heaven…

354
00:34:07,423 --> 00:34:10,510
So, was the funeral just too sad, or--

355
00:34:12,887 --> 00:34:14,722
Something like that, yeah.

356
00:34:14,806 --> 00:34:16,306
If you ever wanna talk--

357
00:34:16,391 --> 00:34:20,268
Oh, no. Thank you. I just-- I'm fine.

358
00:34:22,105 --> 00:34:25,190
But thank you for, you know,
being my funeral buddy today.

359
00:34:26,775 --> 00:34:27,860
Good night.

360
00:34:28,402 --> 00:34:29,402
Good night.

361
00:37:27,498 --> 00:37:28,708
That's Petey?

362
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,711
That's Petey.

363
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:35,840
How did you--

364
00:37:35,923 --> 00:37:39,177
Would you mind taking that
up to diagnostics for me?

365
00:37:46,101 --> 00:37:47,143
Yes?

366
00:37:53,108 --> 00:37:54,985
You requested me, Ms. Cobel?

367
00:37:55,568 --> 00:38:01,324
Ms. Casey, I'd like you to run
a special wellness session with Mark S.

368
00:38:01,992 --> 00:38:02,992
Mark S.?

369
00:38:03,867 --> 00:38:05,286
What's the problem?

370
00:38:08,664 --> 00:38:11,501
He just needs it. Trust me.

371
00:38:26,181 --> 00:38:29,226
"Kier invites you to drink of his water."

372
00:38:30,353 --> 00:38:32,606
-Irving.
-Felicia said you'd be here.

373
00:38:35,692 --> 00:38:39,653
Is it awful to say
I don't care for that one?

374
00:38:40,155 --> 00:38:41,155
No.

375
00:38:41,907 --> 00:38:44,534
Honestly, it makes me nervous too.

376
00:38:46,869 --> 00:38:49,873
Such a lovely vista, but I keep thinking…

377
00:38:49,956 --> 00:38:51,166
He could slip.

378
00:38:55,003 --> 00:38:59,798
It was a thrill to have someone from MDR
come see us,

379
00:38:59,882 --> 00:39:02,469
to take an interest like you did, so…

380
00:39:03,594 --> 00:39:04,846
if I embarrassed myself--

381
00:39:04,929 --> 00:39:05,931
You didn't.

382
00:39:07,224 --> 00:39:09,391
Unless, you did?

383
00:39:10,393 --> 00:39:11,686
Are you embarrassed?

384
00:39:14,521 --> 00:39:15,523
No.

385
00:39:17,858 --> 00:39:18,860
Good.

386
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:23,239
I have four more stops.

387
00:39:26,867 --> 00:39:29,119
Would MDR consider joining me?

388
00:39:31,831 --> 00:39:32,916
MDR would.

389
00:39:35,085 --> 00:39:36,085
You're crazy.

390
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:38,420
I wish I could nap.

391
00:39:39,172 --> 00:39:41,632
I think I sleep 15 hours a night up there.

392
00:39:41,715 --> 00:39:42,967
It's a character flaw.

393
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:45,262
It just means you're a party guy,
disco king.

394
00:39:45,344 --> 00:39:47,597
I can't be falling asleep, Burt.

395
00:39:47,681 --> 00:39:50,057
-Who cares?
-The handbook cares.

396
00:39:50,141 --> 00:39:53,978
"No workplace
shall be repurposed for slumber."

397
00:39:54,061 --> 00:39:58,525
I know the handbook, old man.
I'm more of a first edition guy.

398
00:39:59,985 --> 00:40:06,657
The original word of Kier: "And I shall
whisper to ye dutiful through the ages.

399
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:10,579
In your noblest thoughts and epiphanies
shall be my voice.

400
00:40:10,661 --> 00:40:13,081
You are my mouth,

401
00:40:13,664 --> 00:40:17,168
and through ye, I will whisper on

402
00:40:17,251 --> 00:40:19,880
when I am 10 centuries demised."

403
00:40:22,757 --> 00:40:24,342
I don't understand.

404
00:40:24,425 --> 00:40:28,889
He doesn't just speak to us
through the handbook or the paintings.

405
00:40:29,681 --> 00:40:31,307
He finds other ways.

406
00:40:34,518 --> 00:40:36,313
"You think you need your job.

407
00:40:37,981 --> 00:40:40,358
But I've lived abroad as a vagrant,

408
00:40:40,442 --> 00:40:45,237
abstaining from my own money
to rely on the charity of strangers.

409
00:40:45,822 --> 00:40:49,742
Most were beggars themselves,
yet they were happy.

410
00:40:50,492 --> 00:40:53,413
And so, for that summer, was I.

411
00:40:55,373 --> 00:40:57,708
Your job needs you,

412
00:40:59,085 --> 00:41:01,253
not the other way around."

413
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:09,346
Safe travels, MDR.

414
00:41:10,304 --> 00:41:12,514
Thanks, O&D.

415
00:41:30,867 --> 00:41:32,077
Mark?

416
00:41:33,744 --> 00:41:34,996
I'm gonna go.

417
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:36,248
Do it.

418
00:41:36,331 --> 00:41:39,458
I'm working up till the bell. I think
I may still crush this thing tonight.

419
00:41:40,793 --> 00:41:41,878
I hope you do.

420
00:41:45,215 --> 00:41:46,215
See you soon.

421
00:42:48,527 --> 00:42:49,528
Knew it.

422
00:42:55,452 --> 00:43:00,539
Sometimes I ask people
to sculpt how they feel out of clay.

423
00:43:01,458 --> 00:43:03,460
Would you like to do that?

424
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:08,840
All right.

425
00:43:40,288 --> 00:43:45,793
"'Destiny'. An acrostic poem experience
by the author, Ricken Hale."

426
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:11,527
"D is for dreaming,
the start of it all.

427
00:44:17,074 --> 00:44:19,202
E is for energy…

428
00:44:21,204 --> 00:44:23,123
breaking down walls.

429
00:44:24,416 --> 00:44:26,668
S is for stewardship,

430
00:44:28,128 --> 00:44:30,338
of home and of earth.

431
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:38,387
T is for terror,
which gives us more worth.

432
00:44:42,309 --> 00:44:44,226
I is for eyes,

433
00:44:45,686 --> 00:44:47,688
which observe us with love.

434
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:52,735
Until N, meaning newness,

435
00:44:53,695 --> 00:44:55,989
rains down from above.

436
00:44:58,574 --> 00:44:59,576
And Y.

437
00:45:00,577 --> 00:45:03,288
That's a question we needn't now ponder.

438
00:45:04,539 --> 00:45:09,835
For destiny, friends,
shall deliver all yonder."

439
00:45:12,005 --> 00:45:13,797
Hey. How are you?

440
00:45:13,882 --> 00:45:15,175
Good.

441
00:45:15,257 --> 00:45:17,427
Yeah? Seems like
you're getting the hang of stuff here.

442
00:45:20,179 --> 00:45:21,389
Cool.
