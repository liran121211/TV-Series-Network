1
00:00:50,594 --> 00:00:51,677
Helly leave?

2
00:00:51,761 --> 00:00:52,762
Yeah.

3
00:00:58,475 --> 00:00:59,978
Maybe you should get out of here.

4
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:03,564
I know. Just wrapping up.

5
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,275
Sorry, I love the work.

6
00:01:29,507 --> 00:01:30,549
Jesus.

7
00:01:33,762 --> 00:01:34,763
Help!

8
00:01:37,057 --> 00:01:38,390
Help!

9
00:01:41,645 --> 00:01:43,313
Goddamn it!

10
00:01:47,025 --> 00:01:48,401
Oh, my God.

11
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,371
Is she okay?

12
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:04,584
Helly?

13
00:02:06,085 --> 00:02:08,670
- Mark, get in the elevator.
- Helly? Helly!

14
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:10,006
Get in the elevator!

15
00:02:17,597 --> 00:02:18,848
Is she okay?

16
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,783
- Judd.
- Mr. Scout, you have a good evening.

17
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,201
Will do. Same to you.

18
00:04:41,992 --> 00:04:43,158
Is she alive?

19
00:04:44,786 --> 00:04:46,329
Have a seat, Mark.

20
00:04:59,843 --> 00:05:01,552
She's in the hospital.

21
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:07,350
She has severe bruising but,
thankfully, no permanent damage.

22
00:05:07,434 --> 00:05:08,643
Okay.

23
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:11,855
Okay, so you... You're letting her go?

24
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:14,231
Helly's outie has
no intention of resigning...

25
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:16,151
She almost died.
She doesn't wanna be here.

26
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:18,612
And she will be back at her desk
in a few days.

27
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:19,946
Is that enough time?

28
00:05:22,365 --> 00:05:26,286
This happened on your watch, Mark S.

29
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:34,752
And you can thank Kier himself
it went the way it did.

30
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,379
Have a productive day.

31
00:06:09,954 --> 00:06:11,538
What is it to fail?

32
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:16,961
My failure to break into the literary
world in my 20s was devastating,

33
00:06:17,045 --> 00:06:18,879
yet it taught me a vital lesson.

34
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:24,511
That it was not me who was wrong,
but literature itself.

35
00:06:25,762 --> 00:06:28,430
And that to truly find
my place in that world,

36
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:31,518
I would first need to break it entirely.

37
00:06:32,769 --> 00:06:33,853
And so I did.

38
00:06:33,937 --> 00:06:37,023
A society with festering workers
cannot flourish,

39
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:41,235
just as a man with rotting toes
cannot skip.

40
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:48,867
What separates man from machine is that
machines cannot think for themselves.

41
00:06:49,869 --> 00:06:53,747
Also, they are made of metal,
whereas man is made of skin.

42
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:56,709
If you are a soldier,
do not fight for my freedom.

43
00:06:57,711 --> 00:07:01,213
Fight for the freedom
of the soldier fighting next to you.

44
00:07:02,298 --> 00:07:05,552
This will make the war more inspiring
for you both.

45
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:09,180
A good person will follow the rules.

46
00:07:09,723 --> 00:07:12,182
A great person will follow himself.

47
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:16,478
Bullies are nothing but Bull and Lies.

48
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:21,276
At the center of "Industry" is "Dust."

49
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:26,406
They cannot crucify you
if your hand is in a fist.

50
00:07:27,574 --> 00:07:31,577
Should you find yourself contorting
to fit a system, dear reader,

51
00:07:32,954 --> 00:07:37,042
stop and ask if
it's truly you that must change

52
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,002
or the system.

53
00:07:42,422 --> 00:07:43,882
Ran the diagnostics.

54
00:07:44,382 --> 00:07:45,925
And?

55
00:07:46,634 --> 00:07:50,137
Full synaptic coupling.
Petey Kilmer's memory was reintegrated.

56
00:07:52,307 --> 00:07:53,475
You were right, Harmony.

57
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,478
We should celebrate.

58
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:04,194
I figure you'll take a beat
before telling the Board,

59
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:06,196
especially after
what happened with Helly R.

60
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,451
Jesus. You haven't told them.

61
00:08:14,788 --> 00:08:17,456
Comb the chip data for source signatures.

62
00:08:17,999 --> 00:08:20,125
It's saved, so you can keep it.

63
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:24,172
A gift.

64
00:08:25,423 --> 00:08:27,425
Please find out who did this.

65
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:31,053
I'd like to deliver everything
to the Board at once.

66
00:08:41,147 --> 00:08:42,774
Oh, shit.

67
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,274
Hi, Mark, it's Ricken.

68
00:08:44,359 --> 00:08:47,736
Listen, I know you're still
in severed Mark form,

69
00:08:47,821 --> 00:08:51,783
but Devon's at 4 centimeters,
so this baby is officially coming.

70
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:55,662
We're headed to the birthing retreat now,
so please come.

71
00:08:55,745 --> 00:08:57,581
Mark, Ricken again.

72
00:08:57,663 --> 00:09:00,917
We're at the retreat, and the child
is continuing toward the birth canal,

73
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,544
so it would be really great
if you were here.

74
00:09:03,628 --> 00:09:06,464
I don't know if they let you
have your phone down there...

75
00:09:06,965 --> 00:09:10,092
Actually, if this is Mark's work self,

76
00:09:10,176 --> 00:09:12,721
please tell him
Ricken said to come quickly.

77
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:16,057
Mark, we're still here.
Wondering if you're lost.

78
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,767
We are in cabin six,

79
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:20,269
which is through the gate
and at the end of the row.

80
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:22,938
It's one of the more
affordably sized units,

81
00:09:23,023 --> 00:09:24,649
but you should be able to find it.

82
00:09:24,732 --> 00:09:26,317
Please do come soon.

83
00:09:35,869 --> 00:09:37,037
Hey.

84
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,495
Hey. Hey.

85
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:42,792
Did you forget that I was gonna be here?

86
00:09:45,336 --> 00:09:46,337
Slightly.

87
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:53,260
Look, I'm sorry about the other night. I…

88
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,554
Yeah, no, it's fine.

89
00:09:56,764 --> 00:09:57,765
Yeah.

90
00:09:59,142 --> 00:10:01,019
- She's doing great, by the way.
- Yeah?

91
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:01,937
- Yeah.
- Okay.

92
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:05,105
The contractions are about
20 minutes apart,

93
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,649
so we still have some time.

94
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:10,903
Ricken is doing this thing
where he cries over her.

95
00:10:11,571 --> 00:10:13,072
So, I'm...

96
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:16,116
I'm giving them some privacy.

97
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,830
Sounds good.

98
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,671
Hey, thank you for,
you know, taking care of her.

99
00:10:29,422 --> 00:10:30,798
Yeah. Of course.

100
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,269
Babe, I just don't wanna be
like my father.

101
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:45,730
I know, baby. I think it's good
you're getting it out now.

102
00:10:46,898 --> 00:10:48,191
It's okay.

103
00:10:49,442 --> 00:10:50,943
Hey. I'm looking for baby camp?

104
00:10:53,822 --> 00:10:55,698
The uncle-to-be. Welcome, Mark.

105
00:10:55,782 --> 00:10:57,658
Yay! I'm so glad you're here.

106
00:10:57,741 --> 00:11:00,263
I didn't know if they were gonna
wake you up from work or whatever.

107
00:11:00,287 --> 00:11:02,663
Oh, no, I just saw the message
when I got off. Sorry.

108
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:04,541
No, it's been pretty boring so far.

109
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:09,461
All right.
Well, glad to be here in this cozy nook.

110
00:11:09,546 --> 00:11:11,274
- Wow.
- Dude, did you see the one next door?

111
00:11:11,298 --> 00:11:14,216
- Yeah.
- It's, like, psychotically expensive.

112
00:11:14,301 --> 00:11:16,595
It's like a freakin' lodge.
I hate whoever's in there.

113
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:19,306
It's just fat cats making fat kittens.

114
00:11:19,389 --> 00:11:20,389
Yeah.

115
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,183
Oh, shit.

116
00:11:23,268 --> 00:11:24,269
It's a contraction.

117
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:27,313
- Fuck.
- Mark, say a secret quickly.

118
00:11:27,397 --> 00:11:28,940
He doesn't have to, babe.

119
00:11:29,524 --> 00:11:32,277
- What?
- The fetus is drawn to clear air.

120
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,697
Purging secrets can create a soul void
that speeds the labor.

121
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:37,282
Okay, and we want that?

122
00:11:37,365 --> 00:11:39,200
- We do.
- Hey, baby, not right now.

123
00:11:39,283 --> 00:11:42,495
It's fine, I'll start. Mark…

124
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,706
I love you, and I feel hurt
that you haven't called me

125
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:47,207
to thank me for the book yet.

126
00:11:48,418 --> 00:11:50,253
- There. Good.
- The book?

127
00:11:50,336 --> 00:11:53,048
We left a copy of his new book
on your doorstep.

128
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,884
Five days ago. Five full days.

129
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:58,510
Okay, well,
I definitely haven't seen that.

130
00:11:58,595 --> 00:12:00,764
I mean, it must've been stolen
or something. I...

131
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:03,515
What? That was an advanced copy.

132
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,311
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

133
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:09,563
- Are you okay?
- Oh, my God.

134
00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:11,649
I'm okay.

135
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:13,275
It's fine. It's all fine.

136
00:12:16,654 --> 00:12:20,533
Okay, okay. I'm okay. Are you okay?

137
00:12:20,616 --> 00:12:21,743
Okay.

138
00:12:22,326 --> 00:12:23,787
- I'm good.
- Yeah?

139
00:12:24,495 --> 00:12:26,873
- Yeah, I'm gonna go get coffee.
- Really?

140
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:29,542
Yeah. I think. I'm gonna get going.

141
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:32,504
- Are you sure?
- Thank you. Thanks, bud.

142
00:12:34,088 --> 00:12:35,631
- All right. I'll be back.
- Yeah.

143
00:12:35,715 --> 00:12:37,008
Okay. Be careful.

144
00:12:45,225 --> 00:12:47,644
Well, this is good.
We can finish setting up the room.

145
00:12:53,524 --> 00:12:55,568
Mark, would you help me hang the kelp?

146
00:12:56,986 --> 00:12:58,572
Hang the kelp? Why?

147
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:01,575
Do you really want me to explain it?

148
00:13:13,336 --> 00:13:14,336
Hi.

149
00:13:22,011 --> 00:13:23,221
Hi. Excuse me?

150
00:13:24,306 --> 00:13:25,307
Sir?

151
00:13:26,182 --> 00:13:27,182
Sir...

152
00:13:30,854 --> 00:13:31,980
Hey.

153
00:13:32,898 --> 00:13:35,609
What the fuck, man? Oh, my Go...

154
00:13:37,235 --> 00:13:39,821
Hi, I'm so sorry.
I'm another pregnant lady.

155
00:13:39,904 --> 00:13:42,782
I'm from over there.
I just came out on a coffee run,

156
00:13:42,865 --> 00:13:45,784
and I got distracted
by your beautiful coffee,

157
00:13:45,869 --> 00:13:48,580
and I was wondering if there's any chance
you could hook me up.

158
00:13:51,415 --> 00:13:52,417
Okay.

159
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,503
Yeah? Yes. Thank you. Thank Christ.

160
00:13:59,341 --> 00:14:00,841
Hi. Thank you so much.

161
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:03,094
I'm gonna squeeze right past you.

162
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:10,684
I'm Devon.

163
00:14:11,227 --> 00:14:12,354
Gabby.

164
00:14:12,437 --> 00:14:14,272
Thank you for narcotics.

165
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:17,692
My husband is driving me fucking crazy.

166
00:14:18,235 --> 00:14:21,779
My brother's… depressing me.

167
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:25,741
Is it your first?

168
00:14:26,493 --> 00:14:27,786
Yeah. Yours?

169
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:29,788
My third.

170
00:14:30,705 --> 00:14:32,039
I'm naming him William.

171
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:36,086
Three kiddos. I'm so fucking scared
of ruining one child.

172
00:14:37,044 --> 00:14:38,587
How do you handle it?

173
00:14:39,297 --> 00:14:41,633
- Lotta help, I guess.
- Yeah.

174
00:14:42,133 --> 00:14:45,553
Holy shit, by the way,
how about this cabin? It's so nice.

175
00:14:46,346 --> 00:14:47,389
Are you rich?

176
00:14:54,187 --> 00:14:58,316
Because really…
if the thief reads the book,

177
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,692
it will have been worth it.

178
00:15:00,402 --> 00:15:03,529
In fact, I bet you
he turns himself in afterward.

179
00:15:05,782 --> 00:15:10,620
Listen, I know the last time you were
in a medical facility was for Gemma.

180
00:15:12,038 --> 00:15:14,624
Is that what this is? A medical facility?

181
00:15:16,835 --> 00:15:20,462
Of course, the baby's middle name could've
been so lovely a tribute to her, but…

182
00:15:21,715 --> 00:15:24,551
I understand you were unable
to be comfortable with it.

183
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:28,679
Your kid deserves her own name
without some…

184
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:31,932
big, feely baggage.

185
00:15:41,025 --> 00:15:42,318
Yes.

186
00:15:55,331 --> 00:15:56,499
I got coffee.

187
00:15:58,585 --> 00:16:00,253
Toll, please.

188
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:05,674
I made friends
with the richest lady in baby camp.

189
00:16:06,927 --> 00:16:07,969
She was…

190
00:16:08,845 --> 00:16:10,388
quiet, but she was nice.

191
00:16:11,056 --> 00:16:13,600
Very cute. I should send you up there.

192
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:16,477
I'd imagine she's spoken for.

193
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,106
I bet Alexa would give you another shot.

194
00:16:23,275 --> 00:16:24,818
I bet she wouldn't.

195
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,322
- I bet you could ask her.
- Okay.

196
00:16:30,575 --> 00:16:33,370
You okay? Do you want me to go get her?

197
00:16:33,452 --> 00:16:35,996
No, no, no. Hold on,
can I squeeze your hand?

198
00:16:36,081 --> 00:16:37,790
Yeah. There we go.

199
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:39,750
All right.

200
00:16:43,254 --> 00:16:46,173
- Need me to tell a secret?
- Yeah, go ahead.

201
00:16:46,258 --> 00:16:47,926
Give me your dark shit.

202
00:16:48,009 --> 00:16:50,095
Well, so…

203
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:04,608
I kinda think Lumon might be
up to something.

204
00:17:05,234 --> 00:17:07,945
What do you mean?
Like, with your paychecks?

205
00:17:08,946 --> 00:17:13,450
No, I've just been hearing stuff.
Just around.

206
00:17:14,118 --> 00:17:15,494
Who've you been talking to?

207
00:17:17,872 --> 00:17:19,164
So…

208
00:17:23,127 --> 00:17:24,128
What?

209
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:27,882
Do you remember the businessman?

210
00:17:32,846 --> 00:17:35,347
Holy fucking pit of hell!

211
00:17:35,432 --> 00:17:36,974
Okay. Darling, you okay?

212
00:17:37,851 --> 00:17:39,769
- Why do people do this?
- I'll go get Alexa.

213
00:17:39,853 --> 00:17:42,814
- Great.
- Don't touch me, baby.

214
00:17:42,897 --> 00:17:43,898
Okay.

215
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:47,192
- One more big push.
- Oh, my God.

216
00:17:47,277 --> 00:17:50,447
She's right here.
She's right here. You're doing so great.

217
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:54,284
- It hurts.
- I know it hurts but she's right here.

218
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:57,037
- I can see her. She's crowning. Okay?
- Oh, my God.

219
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:01,750
All right, now. You know,
I can see her. Here she comes.

220
00:18:24,396 --> 00:18:26,775
- Oh, my God.
- She's coming.

221
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:29,277
Oh, my God.

222
00:18:29,361 --> 00:18:31,278
Oh, my God.

223
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,116
Thank you.
She did great. I'm gonna pass out.

224
00:18:36,992 --> 00:18:39,663
She was in outie form
at the time she woke up.

225
00:18:39,746 --> 00:18:44,084
So this will be innie Helly's first
conscious experience since the hanging.

226
00:18:46,044 --> 00:18:49,923
When she sees you,
it's important your eyes be kind.

227
00:18:53,009 --> 00:18:55,470
Do you know how to make your eyes kind?

228
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:41,223
You're okay.

229
00:19:42,726 --> 00:19:45,478
You're okay. It's all right.

230
00:19:58,909 --> 00:20:05,332
So they locked away the extension cords
and other dangerous items so, you know,

231
00:20:06,415 --> 00:20:07,625
you should be safe.

232
00:20:12,797 --> 00:20:16,300
And if you wanna focus on looking for
happy numbers for a while, that's fine.

233
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:23,391
Yeah.

234
00:20:30,315 --> 00:20:31,566
Do you wanna talk about it?

235
00:20:46,122 --> 00:20:49,334
We should hide
inspirational handbook quotes

236
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:53,630
around the office for her to stumble upon.

237
00:20:54,463 --> 00:20:56,674
She just needs
to start earning perks, dude.

238
00:20:56,758 --> 00:20:59,301
I'd end my life
if I didn't have any finger traps yet.

239
00:20:59,844 --> 00:21:02,305
You know, what one of us should do
is lend her our trap

240
00:21:02,388 --> 00:21:04,223
until she has one of her own.

241
00:21:05,141 --> 00:21:08,103
Yeah, but not me though
'cause I already contributed the idea.

242
00:21:08,185 --> 00:21:09,436
It's only fair.

243
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:12,731
Ms. Casey.

244
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:15,902
I'm here to observe Helly R.

245
00:21:17,903 --> 00:21:19,071
No one told me.

246
00:21:19,698 --> 00:21:24,160
Ms. Cobel's orders.
I am to watch her for signs of sadness,

247
00:21:24,243 --> 00:21:27,788
and verbally encourage her
to forgo further suicide attempts.

248
00:21:27,872 --> 00:21:30,250
Upon request, I can also perform a hug.

249
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:34,880
You know I've been exhibiting signs
of sadness. Could I get one of those?

250
00:21:34,962 --> 00:21:35,962
No.

251
00:22:05,367 --> 00:22:06,577
Did you get all that?

252
00:22:09,204 --> 00:22:10,457
Are you upset?

253
00:22:11,499 --> 00:22:14,920
No. I'm peachy.

254
00:22:17,713 --> 00:22:19,465
If you're upset, you can request a...

255
00:22:19,548 --> 00:22:23,510
A hug. I know. I'm good.

256
00:23:15,271 --> 00:23:16,397
Irv.

257
00:23:20,442 --> 00:23:22,237
We lose you again there, buddy?

258
00:23:26,865 --> 00:23:27,866
Irv?

259
00:23:28,367 --> 00:23:30,369
I have to go to O&D.

260
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:33,373
Something's come up.

261
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:39,296
And I'd like to seek Burt's counsel.

262
00:23:40,797 --> 00:23:41,798
Well…

263
00:23:44,342 --> 00:23:48,262
Okay, fine. Just make a copy of that map
in case we have to come find you.

264
00:24:12,787 --> 00:24:13,788
Oh, God.

265
00:24:26,343 --> 00:24:29,054
Oh, no. I'm sorry, Irving.

266
00:24:29,596 --> 00:24:32,782
We must have sent this print job here by
mistake. You weren't supposed to see this.

267
00:24:32,807 --> 00:24:34,017
What are these?

268
00:24:34,683 --> 00:24:38,063
Nothing. A joke for Ms. Cobel.

269
00:24:39,064 --> 00:24:44,527
It's the O&D coup, isn't it?
The one that Dylan talks about, huh?

270
00:24:46,947 --> 00:24:51,992
Did that actually happen, Mr. Milchick?

271
00:24:52,076 --> 00:24:56,373
Of course not.
Nothing like that could happen here.

272
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:02,086
It's proof. It is ironclad proof.

273
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:04,297
Milchick says it didn't happen.

274
00:25:04,381 --> 00:25:07,467
And why would one department
physically attack another?

275
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:10,391
Lumon wouldn't just then give them
all the other department's resources.

276
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:13,431
Does O&D know that?
Are we even sure about it?

277
00:25:13,515 --> 00:25:16,768
Because with seven people,
there is a lot that they could do to us.

278
00:25:18,769 --> 00:25:20,355
- I could ask...
- Your new friend,

279
00:25:20,438 --> 00:25:23,066
who lied to you
about the size of his department?

280
00:25:23,148 --> 00:25:25,229
How do we know
what else he isn't being kosher about?

281
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,670
You ran a 266 on Irving B.?

282
00:25:44,587 --> 00:25:46,798
Yeah. Just now.

283
00:25:51,176 --> 00:25:54,513
I thought it might dissuade him
from spending so much time with Burt G.

284
00:25:58,934 --> 00:26:01,186
I'm sorry. Should I have consulted you?

285
00:26:03,565 --> 00:26:05,942
No, no. Good initiative.

286
00:26:09,613 --> 00:26:11,280
I saw Ms. Casey down there.

287
00:26:13,074 --> 00:26:14,992
You're having her watch Helly R.

288
00:26:16,161 --> 00:26:17,162
I am.

289
00:26:18,454 --> 00:26:20,414
May I ask why?

290
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:27,422
"The light of discovery shines truer
upon a virgin meadow than a beaten path."

291
00:26:33,845 --> 00:26:37,557
I'm trying something new with Ms. Casey.

292
00:26:41,102 --> 00:26:42,770
Keep it between us.

293
00:26:47,901 --> 00:26:48,902
Right.

294
00:27:37,576 --> 00:27:38,785
Helly R.

295
00:27:39,911 --> 00:27:41,246
Hi, Ms. Casey.

296
00:27:42,288 --> 00:27:44,624
Please describe for me
your time in the restroom.

297
00:27:45,709 --> 00:27:52,590
Oh, no. I'm so sorry, Ms. Casey.
I just... I turned and...

298
00:27:52,673 --> 00:27:55,885
Bet you're drunk. What'd your mouth
taste like when you got in today?

299
00:27:57,304 --> 00:28:00,432
Helly R., you have to come with me
to distribution supply.

300
00:28:00,515 --> 00:28:03,559
That's okay.
I can watch Helly R. while you're gone.

301
00:28:03,643 --> 00:28:05,311
It's only a few minutes, right?

302
00:28:05,394 --> 00:28:09,023
Distribution supply is eight minutes,
round trip.

303
00:28:21,076 --> 00:28:24,705
You know, I go to distribution supply
all the time, so I could... If you...

304
00:28:28,167 --> 00:28:30,295
Well, that's one less horrible thing.

305
00:28:31,712 --> 00:28:33,632
For eight minutes anyway.

306
00:28:35,217 --> 00:28:39,762
Helly, I just realized I haven't shown you
where we keep the extra pen caps.

307
00:28:41,056 --> 00:28:42,265
It's not far. Do you mind?

308
00:28:43,432 --> 00:28:45,769
I'm good, thanks.

309
00:28:46,478 --> 00:28:49,730
Nah, you're right. We shouldn't go
anywhere without Ms. Casey.

310
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,574
Careful out there, boss.

311
00:29:00,784 --> 00:29:02,368
Weird energy about.

312
00:29:31,981 --> 00:29:33,732
So where are all these pen caps at?

313
00:29:35,986 --> 00:29:37,278
How are you doing, Helly?

314
00:29:37,988 --> 00:29:40,740
Jesus. Did you make up the pen caps
to ask me that?

315
00:29:40,824 --> 00:29:42,409
Well, I just wanted to talk.

316
00:29:44,577 --> 00:29:45,996
I'm really bad, Mark.

317
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,664
Thanks for noticing.

318
00:29:51,209 --> 00:29:52,210
Come here.

319
00:29:59,217 --> 00:30:00,259
Come on.

320
00:30:14,356 --> 00:30:15,400
Here.

321
00:30:18,737 --> 00:30:19,820
Petey's map.

322
00:30:20,821 --> 00:30:24,021
Yeah. Since you've been gone, I've been
trying to recreate it on my lunch breaks.

323
00:30:24,534 --> 00:30:25,535
And…

324
00:30:26,368 --> 00:30:29,079
I thought maybe
if we work on it together, we can…

325
00:30:31,124 --> 00:30:32,334
you know.

326
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:35,045
I'm not your new Petey.

327
00:30:47,182 --> 00:30:48,224
Helly.

328
00:30:51,228 --> 00:30:52,269
Helly R.?

329
00:30:54,189 --> 00:30:57,107
- Mark took her to look at pen caps.
- Where?

330
00:30:58,192 --> 00:30:59,861
- Now?
- They're fine.

331
00:30:59,944 --> 00:31:02,279
Just at the end of the storage wing.

332
00:31:08,118 --> 00:31:09,913
Burt G. is in the conference room.

333
00:31:26,429 --> 00:31:27,430
Burt.

334
00:31:29,598 --> 00:31:30,599
Irving.

335
00:31:33,435 --> 00:31:34,895
What are you doing here?

336
00:31:35,771 --> 00:31:39,526
You know, I was turned around.

337
00:31:40,277 --> 00:31:41,278
Actually, I...

338
00:31:42,653 --> 00:31:45,865
I was looking for you.
I hadn't heard from you.

339
00:31:51,162 --> 00:31:52,413
Well, I...

340
00:31:53,248 --> 00:31:55,040
- Dylan! Oh, my God! What are...
- Irving.

341
00:31:55,125 --> 00:31:56,250
What are you doing?

342
00:31:56,334 --> 00:31:57,919
- He was coming at you.
- Let him out!

343
00:31:58,002 --> 00:31:59,730
- Out? Why the fuck is he here?
- Let him out!

344
00:31:59,753 --> 00:32:01,147
- What's wrong with you?
- You saw that painting.

345
00:32:01,172 --> 00:32:03,048
You want to get disemboweled today?

346
00:32:03,133 --> 00:32:04,718
Hey, where's your friends? Plural.

347
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,386
As in, the six fucking people
you've been hiding from us.

348
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:09,055
Oh, my word. I...

349
00:32:09,138 --> 00:32:11,016
I need a manager!

350
00:32:11,098 --> 00:32:12,433
Irving, wait. Don't go.

351
00:32:12,517 --> 00:32:14,394
- I... We...
- I know what you're up to.

352
00:32:14,477 --> 00:32:17,396
- What is wrong with you? Open the door.
- Manager!

353
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,690
Open the door.

354
00:32:18,772 --> 00:32:21,358
- We need a manager. We need a manager.
- Irving!

355
00:32:21,442 --> 00:32:22,818
Irving!

356
00:32:24,904 --> 00:32:25,905
Helly?

357
00:32:31,786 --> 00:32:32,787
Helly.

358
00:32:35,373 --> 00:32:36,625
Helly.

359
00:32:41,837 --> 00:32:43,173
Where the fuck are we?

360
00:32:43,882 --> 00:32:46,009
Look, don't you want to get these to...

361
00:32:46,092 --> 00:32:49,011
I told her I wanted out,
and she told me I wasn't a person.

362
00:32:49,721 --> 00:32:51,347
My own self told me that.

363
00:32:51,431 --> 00:32:55,894
Yeah, and that's horrible.
But don't focus on her.

364
00:32:56,769 --> 00:32:59,980
What do you want? In here?

365
00:33:01,566 --> 00:33:06,070
What I want is for her to wake up
while the life drains out of her

366
00:33:06,153 --> 00:33:07,864
and to know it was me who did it.

367
00:33:19,459 --> 00:33:21,627
- If I could just explain...
- Save it, marauder.

368
00:33:21,711 --> 00:33:24,297
I checked the whole storage wing.
No sign of him or Helly.

369
00:33:24,381 --> 00:33:26,383
Shit. O&D has probably
killed them already.

370
00:33:26,465 --> 00:33:28,009
Irving, what?

371
00:33:28,676 --> 00:33:33,181
Our department chief and new hire have
gone missing. Do you know where they are?

372
00:33:33,265 --> 00:33:35,392
No, I just came to see you.

373
00:33:35,474 --> 00:33:37,018
And the rest of your department?

374
00:33:37,102 --> 00:33:40,145
They're back in O&D, Irving.
I know I said it was just Felicia and me...

375
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:43,732
If you came here to see me,
then why are you in the conference room?

376
00:33:43,817 --> 00:33:45,484
Why not come right to the office?

377
00:33:45,568 --> 00:33:48,947
I didn't know why you hadn't been back,
and I didn't wanna scare you again.

378
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:50,240
Like with the hand thing.

379
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,701
You didn't scare me.

380
00:33:52,784 --> 00:33:56,246
Or embarrass you.
Look, I was working out a joke.

381
00:33:56,328 --> 00:33:57,913
- A joke?
- To say when I got in.

382
00:33:57,998 --> 00:33:59,124
Prove it. Tell it.

383
00:33:59,207 --> 00:34:01,084
I hadn't worked it out yet.

384
00:34:05,087 --> 00:34:09,592
Why did you lie about
the number of people in your department?

385
00:34:10,844 --> 00:34:11,844
Because…

386
00:34:14,597 --> 00:34:16,016
we don't trust your guys.

387
00:34:16,099 --> 00:34:18,934
- You? The king of fucks don't trust us?
- I do.

388
00:34:19,018 --> 00:34:24,148
But people just talk about MDR.
Stupid old stories, jokes even.

389
00:34:24,231 --> 00:34:25,608
What do you mean?

390
00:34:25,692 --> 00:34:26,693
I…

391
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,532
It's literally silly.
Like, they say you all have pouches.

392
00:34:32,614 --> 00:34:36,119
- Pouches? Like to carry young?
- Yes.

393
00:34:36,202 --> 00:34:40,206
According to some,
you each have a larval offspring

394
00:34:40,289 --> 00:34:43,335
that will jump out and attack
if we get too close.

395
00:34:43,418 --> 00:34:44,628
That's fucking psycho.

396
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:47,672
I mean, it's a joke of course,
but I don't know.

397
00:34:47,755 --> 00:34:50,759
The sentiment, you know, somehow holds.
People are weird.

398
00:34:50,842 --> 00:34:53,385
- Yeah.
- Though, I'd be remiss not to say

399
00:34:53,469 --> 00:34:59,266
that in this theory, the larva
eventually eats and replaces you.

400
00:35:00,684 --> 00:35:03,521
Which, Irving, would solve the mystery…

401
00:35:05,231 --> 00:35:07,108
of your youthful energy.

402
00:35:14,782 --> 00:35:17,077
Irv. Irv?

403
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:18,994
- Excuse me.
- Where are you going?

404
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:20,121
Yes?

405
00:35:21,206 --> 00:35:22,623
Are you sweet on this guy?

406
00:35:25,043 --> 00:35:26,085
You disapprove?

407
00:35:26,168 --> 00:35:28,295
I do. I do disapprove.

408
00:35:29,047 --> 00:35:32,132
Certainly the handbook forbids
taking heart to other employees.

409
00:35:32,217 --> 00:35:33,717
Rat-fuck the handbook.

410
00:35:33,802 --> 00:35:37,264
This guy's O and goddamn D,
who are duplicitous snakes to a one.

411
00:35:37,347 --> 00:35:38,514
It's not safe.

412
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:34,278
They're not ready.

413
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,990
You can't take them yet.
They're not ready.

414
00:36:39,784 --> 00:36:40,952
It isn't time!

415
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,206
- We don't...
- Get the hell out of here.

416
00:36:47,708 --> 00:36:49,001
Go!

417
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:58,385
"The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design"?

418
00:36:58,469 --> 00:37:00,347
That's what it said.

419
00:37:01,097 --> 00:37:03,516
There's definitely
no painting by that name.

420
00:37:04,016 --> 00:37:06,101
What kind of barbarities were we enacting?

421
00:37:06,186 --> 00:37:08,938
It doesn't matter.
I don't think it was real.

422
00:37:09,521 --> 00:37:13,610
I mean, I'll have to confer with my larva,
of course.

423
00:37:17,405 --> 00:37:23,286
- I'm sorry you had to do this.
- It's all right.

424
00:37:23,369 --> 00:37:25,079
I mean, you know that

425
00:37:25,163 --> 00:37:30,543
relationships beyond the
platonic are frowned upon anyway.

426
00:37:33,755 --> 00:37:35,465
Is that what we are?

427
00:37:38,842 --> 00:37:43,514
Well, Burt G., at this time I

428
00:37:43,597 --> 00:37:48,769
formally release you
from MDR's supervision.

429
00:37:49,271 --> 00:37:52,773
As Kier said, "Be ever merry."

430
00:37:55,777 --> 00:37:56,987
Would you like to come in?

431
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:01,199
There is something in the storeroom
I'd like to show you.

432
00:38:03,784 --> 00:38:05,327
And Dylan, of course.

433
00:38:06,871 --> 00:38:08,331
No.

434
00:38:10,708 --> 00:38:14,003
The Courtship of Kier and Imogene.

435
00:38:14,963 --> 00:38:19,384
He met his wife
while a stewman in an ether factory.

436
00:38:20,844 --> 00:38:22,762
Damn dumb being here.

437
00:38:23,346 --> 00:38:25,306
She was a swab girl.

438
00:38:25,806 --> 00:38:29,728
The handbook just says they were
bonded by the spirit of industry.

439
00:38:30,561 --> 00:38:34,065
I know,
but if this interpretation is correct,

440
00:38:34,148 --> 00:38:38,695
they met as colleagues.
Took heart to each other as colleagues.

441
00:38:47,202 --> 00:38:52,208
Makes you wonder
how something could be wrong if Kier...

442
00:38:52,291 --> 00:38:55,170
- Get away from him! You lying fuck!
- Dylan, what?

443
00:38:55,253 --> 00:38:56,606
- Dylan!
- He claims he doesn't know

444
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:59,048
about this painting, meanwhile,
it's sitting on his shelf.

445
00:38:59,132 --> 00:39:01,592
- That isn't.
- Irv, we need to go. Now.

446
00:39:02,385 --> 00:39:03,719
It's not the same.

447
00:39:04,387 --> 00:39:05,931
- What?
- Look.

448
00:39:06,014 --> 00:39:08,641
Look at the badges
the raiders are wearing.

449
00:39:08,724 --> 00:39:12,686
That's not O&D, Dylan. It's us.

450
00:39:13,938 --> 00:39:16,733
This one's never gone
into the hallway rotation.

451
00:39:17,358 --> 00:39:19,860
It's called
"The Macrodata Refinement Calamity."

452
00:39:19,945 --> 00:39:21,744
Okay, but we've never done
anything like that.

453
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:24,490
Why the hell would there be
two versions of the same painting?

454
00:39:37,045 --> 00:39:40,005
I mean, what if the goats are the numbers?

455
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:43,552
Like, we're deciding which goats live
and which ones... Oh, God.

456
00:39:43,635 --> 00:39:44,885
I doubt it's that.

457
00:39:44,969 --> 00:39:45,971
Look…

458
00:39:48,097 --> 00:39:50,934
I know you don't wanna be here. But…

459
00:39:52,518 --> 00:39:54,186
I'm glad you are.

460
00:39:55,981 --> 00:40:00,402
And I'm sorry
that this is the best I can do right now.

461
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:05,824
If you give me the map, I'll clean it up.

462
00:40:09,744 --> 00:40:11,204
Your drawing is shit.

463
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:17,960
Hi, Ms. Casey.

464
00:40:18,043 --> 00:40:20,838
We were just heading back
from our mental health walk.

465
00:40:21,672 --> 00:40:23,382
You're both unhurt?

466
00:40:24,384 --> 00:40:25,552
We are.

467
00:40:26,802 --> 00:40:30,514
I'm glad. I was scared.

468
00:40:31,016 --> 00:40:32,141
I'm sorry.

469
00:40:34,018 --> 00:40:35,311
I forgive you.

470
00:40:38,606 --> 00:40:39,940
Okay, then.

471
00:40:59,793 --> 00:41:02,005
You aware what MDR is up to right now?

472
00:41:02,088 --> 00:41:05,217
I thought that's what you were paid for.

473
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,092
You're not stopping it?

474
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:11,847
"The surest way to tame a prisoner
is to let him believe he's free."

475
00:41:12,431 --> 00:41:14,226
There's a Kier quote for everything.

476
00:41:14,309 --> 00:41:16,329
How many more departments
are you gonna let them find?

477
00:41:16,353 --> 00:41:18,396
I'll have a word with Mark.

478
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,233
I would be careful.
Upstairs wouldn't look kindly on this.

479
00:41:23,318 --> 00:41:24,652
Yes, Daddy.

480
00:41:27,947 --> 00:41:31,492
You can talk to me when you figure out
who hacked Kilmer's chip.

481
00:41:41,168 --> 00:41:43,088
Excuse me, everyone.

482
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:48,969
I wanna introduce you all
to Irving and Dylan.

483
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,221
They're from MDR.

484
00:41:53,889 --> 00:41:54,974
And they're friends.
