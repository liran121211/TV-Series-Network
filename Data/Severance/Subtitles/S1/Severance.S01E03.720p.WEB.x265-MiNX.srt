1
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:12,054
Petey, are you okay?

2
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:19,019
Petey?

3
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:25,025
Yeah, I'm good. I just slipped.
You should invest in a bath mat, maybe.

4
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:29,655
Yeah, okay.
The robe is a gift from my brother-in-law.

5
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:32,824
I've never worn it or anything.
Sorry, it's weird.

6
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:36,620
I have pillows. Do you need anything else?

7
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:40,290
Yeah, I want you to stop
shitting on this awesome robe.

8
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:43,293
Well, you can keep it.

9
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:44,670
I will.

10
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:49,341
Hey. Are you sure nobody can see
in any of these transoms?

11
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:50,509
Yeah.

12
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,261
And everything's locked upstairs.

13
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:55,931
Anybody live in that unit next door?

14
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,892
No, it's just Mrs. Selvig
in the other direction.

15
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:04,188
The neighborhood never really filled up,
so it's nice. Quiet.

16
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,860
Fortress of solitude.

17
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:11,738
I still think an occasional mixer
wouldn't hurt anything.

18
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:15,200
I checked, and it's
not expressly prohibited in the manual.

19
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:16,285
Yeah, I bet!

20
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:19,538
Dude, I pressed Cobel
for an all-floor mixer last quarter.

21
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:22,416
She said you'll get one when you earn it,
whatever that means.

22
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:25,043
-Cobel?
-I can't imagine Dylan's 4%

23
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:26,879
on Sunset Park's gonna help with--

24
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:29,798
Petey?

25
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:32,384
You okay?

26
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:37,723
I'm sorry. Yeah.

27
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:43,896
With this sickness,
I just-- I get disoriented.

28
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:45,856
It's temporary.

29
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:49,234
What's Sunset Park?

30
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:53,447
I don't know.

31
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:16,464
It's like having two different lives
suddenly stitched together.

32
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,551
But the relativity's fucked.

33
00:04:19,635 --> 00:04:23,639
So, my first day at Lumon's
as far back as my fifth birthday.

34
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:26,808
And with two pasts,
it blurs the present too.

35
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:29,937
But they said it will get better.

36
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:34,149
Who's "they"?

37
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:40,614
"They" is a group of people that know
severance is a blight on mankind.

38
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,741
And they're gonna do something about it.

39
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,162
The Whole Mind Collective?

40
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:51,583
The kids trolling for signatures downtown?
No, not the fucking WMC.

41
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,002
Someone else.

42
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:56,380
All right. Well--

43
00:04:59,258 --> 00:05:02,970
So, what do you want from me?

44
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,766
Don't you wanna know
what you're doing down there?

45
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,149
Okay, look.
You know, I'm not gonna unsever.

46
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,945
Well, I don't want you to unsever
because that's not a word.

47
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:23,073
-Reintegration.
-All right. Well, whatever.

48
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:26,118
You know, it hasn't been a blight for me.

49
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:27,703
It's helped me.

50
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:32,332
Okay. What if the cost of that help

51
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,919
is that you're murdering people
eight hours a day

52
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:37,045
and you don't even know it?

53
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:39,882
Well, am I?

54
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:47,848
Look, I found a department.
One they don't tell us about.

55
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,600
One where you don't get to leave.

56
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:53,562
Well, don't none of us get to leave?

57
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:58,233
No, I mean you really don't get to leave.
As in, they're down there right now.

58
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:00,444
Well, what? Like, chained up, or--

59
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,823
What?

60
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:11,705
I'm not gonna talk about it in here.

61
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:17,211
I don't know if the monitors are bugged.
Or if Irving's gonna walk in.

62
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:27,888
Petey, we're not at Lumon.

63
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:35,395
Then where the fuck is June?

64
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:48,492
I'm sorry, Mark.

65
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,211
Who's June?

66
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:07,469
June is my daughter. Greatest kid on Earth
and a hell of a guitar player.

67
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,019
How happy are you
that you asked me to stay here?

68
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,135
Oh, Mark.

69
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:52,598
Are you all right?

70
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:58,937
But what do you say, Natalie,
to the woman who became pregnant at work

71
00:07:59,021 --> 00:08:01,356
less than a month
after her company went severed?

72
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,859
Well, first,
I'd suggest she reveal her identity

73
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:05,569
if she wants an honest conversation

74
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,696
-about her experience.
-How could she have that conversation

75
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:10,699
-when her workie was the one involved--
-Okay, first of all, workie?

76
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:13,410
That, as I understand,
is the preferred term among--

77
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,246
I think it's exactly the condescending
verbiage that I'd expect

78
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,874
from a group trying to save people
from their own choices.

79
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:20,667
Choices? Did her insie have a--

80
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:22,711
Insie? Where are you getting these terms?

81
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:25,797
Fine. Call it someone
who's had their brain split in half--

82
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:28,050
That has nothing to do
with what we do at Lumon

83
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:29,635
nor any severance procedure.

84
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:31,386
I understand you don't wanna answer
my questions…

85
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,722
-I'm answering your questions.
-…because it'll reveal that you are

86
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:36,683
-complicit in something totally immoral.
-What's immoral is--

87
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:42,438
Tell me it's not true.

88
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:47,027
Well, I want to, but I can't. See?

89
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:50,030
…continuing through the greater basin,

90
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:54,535
probably into the afternoon,
just as we predicted yesterday.

91
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:58,997
The good news is, those clouds should
dissipate somewhere over the Ganz area,

92
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:03,001
leaving a clear, sunny day,
for our friends in and around Kier.

93
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:05,796
That said,
the cold's not letting up anywhere.

94
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,674
And those roads are going to remain
icy throughout the week

95
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,175
and on into the weekend.

96
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:12,761
So wherever you're headed,
please do commute with care.

97
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:21,228
Petey.

98
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:27,442
Wake up, Petey. Petey?

99
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:34,616
Hey.

100
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:37,703
It's morning. You are in my basement.

101
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:41,248
Right.

102
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:46,128
So I'm going to work like you said.
You can stay here if you want.

103
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,590
I just wanna let you know,

104
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:54,052
I'm not gonna reintegrate, you know?

105
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:58,348
Okay.

106
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:02,060
I lost my wife a couple years ago
in a car accident.

107
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:06,023
This is-- It's helping me, you know?

108
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,483
-I'm sorry, Mark.
-No, no, no. No.

109
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:11,862
At work…

110
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:18,994
you'd come in sometimes with red eyes.

111
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:23,874
We had a joke
that you had an elevator allergy.

112
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:27,085
There was even a song for it.

113
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:30,797
But I always wondered.

114
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:34,635
You carry the hurt with you.

115
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:38,847
You feel it down there too.
You just don't know what it is.

116
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:43,268
Okay.

117
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:47,231
Why don't you grab
whatever you want up in the fridge?

118
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:48,607
I should be back around 6:00.

119
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:05,541
Hi!

120
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:09,878
-Hey.
-Mark, I'm sorry for the racket!

121
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:13,257
I'm just deicing my stoop.

122
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:17,177
No worries. Thanks again for the cookies.

123
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:18,762
I'll bring by more!

124
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:21,139
Please.

125
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:57,301
-Mr. Scout, how are you doing?
-Hey, Judd.

126
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:41,595
I did a thing.
I deleted the scary numbers.

127
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:42,679
When?

128
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:45,766
-Yesterday. You were gone.
-I was?

129
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:49,645
Oh, yeah. Dylan took over training
in your stead to great success.

130
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:53,106
You look trim, Mark.
I wonder if you were food poisoned.

131
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:55,317
Welcome back, boss. New photos come in?

132
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,195
Oh, good. You can finally get rid
of those old ones.

133
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:05,953
You may as well skip it actually,
'cause I put in my resignation request.

134
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:08,580
-You did submit it?
-I did.

135
00:13:09,915 --> 00:13:12,793
It's good. It means you won't get sent
to the break room anymore.

136
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:15,921
Hello, Refiners.

137
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,047
Hello, Mr. Milchick.

138
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,841
Mark, I spoke to your outie yesterday.

139
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:20,968
He sounded just shattered
not to be at work.

140
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:22,469
But now that you're here,

141
00:13:22,553 --> 00:13:25,597
care to read your first morning
announcements as department head?

142
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,141
Sure.

143
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:32,104
Should be easier
without me in the audience.

144
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:37,317
Mark used to find it funny
to interrupt Petey's announcements.

145
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:38,986
With gas having.

146
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:45,868
Okay, quiet down, all.
I'm Mark, your new announcements person.

147
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,665
Just a couple things here.

148
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:54,501
Why are you standing weird? Stand normal.

149
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:57,421
I'm-- I'm standing great.

150
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:00,507
Are you uncomfortable?
We could all look away?

151
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:03,844
Okay, there's been some garbage
in the recycling.

152
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:06,597
Please, everybody, don't do that.

153
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:12,811
As a reminder,
Post-it Notes are not to be put on faces.

154
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:14,521
They clog your outie's pores.

155
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:18,817
That one's about me.
I do this beloved character, Sticky Head.

156
00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:22,905
Also, please refrain from boasting
about previously earned waffle parties?

157
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:23,989
Feeling attacked.

158
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:26,366
And lastly--

159
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:34,249
Well, I've never seen a resignation
request get such a quick turnaround.

160
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:39,129
Do I have to finish out the day
or can I skip out now?

161
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:47,804
Lastly, Helly's resignation request…

162
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:50,724
was denied.

163
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,770
Yeah, no, that can't be right.

164
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:56,980
My outie wouldn't do that.

165
00:15:01,777 --> 00:15:03,737
You know, Petey used to say--

166
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:24,049
This is so fun.

167
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:30,055
Shall I, you know,
tiptoe up and sneak to the door?

168
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:32,307
-He's at work, baby. It doesn't matter.
-How do you know?

169
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:34,393
-Because his car's not here.
-Maybe he played hooky.

170
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:36,395
Can you go do it? 'Cause I gotta pee.

171
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:37,980
Yes.

172
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:54,204
Against the door, or to the side?

173
00:15:54,288 --> 00:15:55,956
I think either's really good.

174
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,043
-Do you think he'll be surprised?
-I do.

175
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:03,297
My babe, I'm gonna put it off to the side.

176
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,381
Awesome.

177
00:16:14,183 --> 00:16:15,184
-Perfect.
-Good.

178
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:17,060
-I mean, it's perfect.
-Yes.

179
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:25,652
He's gonna be so excited.

180
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:27,196
-Yeah.
-I hope he comes home early.

181
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,405
He's not going to.

182
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,759
Hey. What's that? Sudoku?

183
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:32,386
It's nothing.

184
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:34,179
What were you drawing?

185
00:17:34,263 --> 00:17:36,890
You getting back to work, in cubist form.

186
00:17:36,974 --> 00:17:40,143
Kay, two things.
How do you know what cubist form is?

187
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:42,437
And what the fuck are you wearing?

188
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:46,733
Oh, fuck.

189
00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:56,887
No.

190
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:23,622
Yes?

191
00:19:29,503 --> 00:19:32,256
What did he tell her
after the announcement?

192
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:45,644
No, it's not so bad.

193
00:19:52,693 --> 00:19:55,529
Just mildly aggressive.

194
00:19:58,073 --> 00:20:00,033
Did you give her directed praise?

195
00:20:02,077 --> 00:20:04,496
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

196
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:06,498
I'm coming.

197
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:11,188
Hey, Helly?

198
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:12,272
Go away.

199
00:21:12,773 --> 00:21:14,733
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

200
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:16,485
I mean, it's been, like, 45 minutes.

201
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,116
I'm using the bathroom.

202
00:21:23,784 --> 00:21:27,538
Okay. It's just-- It has been a while.

203
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:30,249
-I'm fine, Mark.
-I think I need to come in.

204
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,543
-That's-- Okay?
-No!

205
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:36,171
I am going to come in, so get ready.

206
00:21:36,255 --> 00:21:38,298
Do the things you need to do
'cause I'm comin' in.

207
00:21:38,382 --> 00:21:39,383
No!

208
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:41,552
-Okay, here I come. I'm sorry.
-Mark, no! I'm not decent!

209
00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:42,845
-Do-- Jesus.
-I'm sorry. I'm--

210
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:47,975
Writing the note directly on your skin.

211
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:51,812
Well, unfortunately, the detectors
can pick up lettering anywhere.

212
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:53,897
Does this look like lettering to you?

213
00:21:53,981 --> 00:21:55,941
Well, if you put your arms together.

214
00:21:58,861 --> 00:21:59,862
Not bad.

215
00:22:01,905 --> 00:22:04,867
I thought you were starting to,
like, be okay here.

216
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,451
What, 'cause I did the numbers thing?

217
00:22:06,535 --> 00:22:09,705
Well, you got a win. You know,
a lot of people find joy in that.

218
00:22:09,788 --> 00:22:11,665
It literally causes fear.

219
00:22:11,748 --> 00:22:14,376
That's just one subset of numbers.
The others are more comforting--

220
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:16,170
Mark, I don't wanna work here with you.

221
00:22:16,253 --> 00:22:19,006
So don't burst into the bathroom
with your pathetic boss voice on

222
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:20,382
and try to convince me that I do.

223
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,763
Okay, I'll give you five minutes
to scrub your arms.

224
00:22:26,847 --> 00:22:28,098
Or what?

225
00:22:29,391 --> 00:22:31,602
Do you want Graner to use the bad soap?

226
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:34,646
There's bad soap?

227
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:40,986
Thanks, boss.

228
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:43,697
Yeah, I fucking love working here.

229
00:22:44,198 --> 00:22:45,324
-Mark.
-Irv.

230
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:47,576
I was listening at the door.
I heard it all.

231
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:49,661
-Okay.
-I am troubled by you having

232
00:22:49,745 --> 00:22:53,290
high-stress exchanges like that
so fresh off your food poisoning.

233
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:54,583
It's fine.

234
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:56,919
The loathing with which she spoke to you.

235
00:22:57,002 --> 00:22:58,462
Well, acclimating takes time.

236
00:22:58,545 --> 00:22:59,796
And guidance.

237
00:23:01,507 --> 00:23:02,674
What's on your mind, Irving?

238
00:23:05,761 --> 00:23:08,805
Dylan was going on all yesterday
about incentives,

239
00:23:08,889 --> 00:23:12,518
pencil erasers and waffle parties,
as though that's why we're here.

240
00:23:12,601 --> 00:23:14,228
That's not why we're here.

241
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:21,318
If it's a deeper meaning she craves,
she should see the perpetuity wing.

242
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:23,570
She can read about all that stuff
in the handbook.

243
00:23:23,654 --> 00:23:27,199
You know it's different to be there.
To see it.

244
00:23:29,284 --> 00:23:31,703
It just seems premature.
I mean, that place is a lot.

245
00:23:31,787 --> 00:23:36,208
Correct. That place is everything.

246
00:23:41,004 --> 00:23:42,005
How'd the check go?

247
00:23:42,548 --> 00:23:46,176
There was a package left at his door
from someone. Open it, would you?

248
00:23:49,513 --> 00:23:51,890
-Oh, God.
-Is this the brother-in-law?

249
00:23:51,974 --> 00:23:53,684
Ricken. His fifth book.

250
00:23:57,187 --> 00:24:01,066
"Chapter 12: On Learning to Be
Emotionally Nude in Front of My Wife."

251
00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:04,069
Check it for messages, just to be safe.

252
00:24:04,653 --> 00:24:05,779
Mark.

253
00:24:07,197 --> 00:24:09,157
-Can I help you?
-Does she have a moment?

254
00:24:09,241 --> 00:24:13,036
Did you fill out an official request
for supervisory interaction?

255
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:16,748
-No, I--
-It's fine. Come in.

256
00:24:16,832 --> 00:24:18,709
Sorry. I can fill out the form.

257
00:24:19,418 --> 00:24:20,419
What is it?

258
00:24:23,088 --> 00:24:24,089
Get the door.

259
00:24:28,093 --> 00:24:31,597
Irving thought we should take Helly
to the perpetuity wing today.

260
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,516
Well, it's a good thing
I made Irving department chief.

261
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:40,898
Sorry. I think I should take Helly
and the team to the perpetuity wing.

262
00:24:40,981 --> 00:24:44,443
And have you filled out
a common-space reservation slip?

263
00:24:46,236 --> 00:24:48,822
-No, I--
-Mark.

264
00:24:48,906 --> 00:24:52,284
I'm sorry. I've just been-- I don't know.

265
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:55,037
It's been weird since Petey left.

266
00:24:56,663 --> 00:25:00,751
I mean, you know, he was--
He set the tone.

267
00:25:02,836 --> 00:25:06,924
If Petey were
the tone-setter you're lionizing him as,

268
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:09,426
he'd still be here.

269
00:25:12,054 --> 00:25:13,055
What does that mean?

270
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:17,518
Are you gonna make me throw my mug at you?

271
00:25:19,061 --> 00:25:20,812
I-- Why would you--

272
00:25:22,898 --> 00:25:25,442
-Get MDR to its numbers.
-Okay.

273
00:25:28,612 --> 00:25:29,613
Mark?

274
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:35,869
What I just did was something I knew
that you could handle and grow from.

275
00:25:37,037 --> 00:25:39,373
It was very painful for me.

276
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:43,460
I hope that you'll let it help you.

277
00:25:50,968 --> 00:25:52,261
Open or closed?

278
00:25:58,183 --> 00:25:59,351
Both.

279
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:04,606
I'll just--

280
00:26:09,903 --> 00:26:14,950
My delts are embarrassingly good today.
My outie does muscle shows for sure.

281
00:26:15,033 --> 00:26:17,911
If your outie did muscle shows,
you wouldn't have to work here.

282
00:26:17,995 --> 00:26:19,872
I'm sorry, do you know
how much muscle shows pay?

283
00:26:19,955 --> 00:26:21,456
No, none of us can know that.

284
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,333
I imagine it's a tiered system.

285
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:27,254
Perhaps there are monetary
prizes for gold, silver and bronze.

286
00:26:27,337 --> 00:26:31,508
No. My guess is that
they do it piecemeal per muscle. So…

287
00:26:31,592 --> 00:26:33,969
-No, I don't think so.
-Best delt, 30 bucks.

288
00:26:34,052 --> 00:26:38,140
Best ab, 20 bucks.
Biceps are a little flashier, 75 bucks.

289
00:26:38,223 --> 00:26:39,892
I would think lats carry a high value.

290
00:26:39,975 --> 00:26:42,728
They're considered very attractive
in muscle-building circles.

291
00:26:42,811 --> 00:26:44,605
And in society at large.

292
00:26:44,688 --> 00:26:46,190
Lats are bullshit, dude--

293
00:26:46,273 --> 00:26:49,359
-The center of a good physique.
-You are alone on this one, Irv…

294
00:26:49,443 --> 00:26:51,445
-You've never noticed my lats?
-…I assure you. Never once.

295
00:26:51,528 --> 00:26:56,658
You don't understand why my posture's
ramrod straight. You see how…

296
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:05,959
Thirsty?

297
00:27:09,213 --> 00:27:12,466
Hey, just in case
you find this relevant for some reason,

298
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:17,346
the code detectors can read messages
hidden inside the body as well.

299
00:27:20,182 --> 00:27:25,979
Also, when that happens, it's Milchick's
job to extract the message from you.

300
00:27:26,563 --> 00:27:31,235
And when he asks
how long ago you ingested it,

301
00:27:31,318 --> 00:27:34,613
I really can't recommend honesty enough.

302
00:27:36,782 --> 00:27:40,077
It's easier for you both
if he knows which end to start from.

303
00:27:50,254 --> 00:27:51,547
Another good try though.

304
00:27:56,552 --> 00:27:58,846
Go shut down your workstation.
We're taking a trip.

305
00:27:58,929 --> 00:28:00,472
The power is in your calves.

306
00:28:00,556 --> 00:28:04,393
…and it's always been that way.
I can tell you that right now, young boy.

307
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:07,729
All eight CEOs have been
of the Eagan lineage.

308
00:28:07,813 --> 00:28:09,690
A line dating back to the founder.

309
00:28:09,773 --> 00:28:12,860
I have a mnemonic poem
to help you remember their names.

310
00:28:12,943 --> 00:28:16,363
I authored it myself, and of course,
it falls outside corporate canon,

311
00:28:16,446 --> 00:28:18,740
and it's poetically imperfect, to be sure.

312
00:28:18,824 --> 00:28:22,828
There's a slant rhyme in the second verse.
of "Ambrose" to "ban those,"

313
00:28:22,911 --> 00:28:26,665
which was necessary
to further the narrative, but regrettable.

314
00:28:26,748 --> 00:28:30,502
Ambrose is sometimes unfairly maligned as
a black sheep in the annals of the family.

315
00:28:30,586 --> 00:28:31,587
What's this?

316
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:34,590
And it certainly wasn't my intent
to slight him further,

317
00:28:34,673 --> 00:28:36,758
-but I think you'll find…
-"Eagan bingo"?

318
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:38,677
Hey. Eagan bingo.

319
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:42,264
-We shouldn't, right? This--
-…for when we arrive…

320
00:28:42,347 --> 00:28:44,183
Hey, what the hell is Eagan bingo?

321
00:28:44,266 --> 00:28:46,810
It's how you don't die of boredom
in the perpetuity wing.

322
00:28:46,894 --> 00:28:48,896
And come on,
it'll be an excellent opportunity

323
00:28:48,979 --> 00:28:50,689
for everyone except Irv to bond.

324
00:29:02,284 --> 00:29:03,535
Optics and Design.

325
00:29:04,953 --> 00:29:06,705
Macrodata Refinement.

326
00:29:08,624 --> 00:29:09,625
Burt.

327
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:10,709
Hi.

328
00:29:11,418 --> 00:29:13,212
I trust that your session was good.

329
00:29:13,295 --> 00:29:15,005
Great, very restorative.

330
00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:16,548
Wa-- You two know each other?

331
00:29:16,632 --> 00:29:21,595
We were just admiring
some Lumon artwork together, very briefly.

332
00:29:21,678 --> 00:29:24,431
Remember, we'll have
those new handbook totes soon.

333
00:29:24,515 --> 00:29:25,641
So exciting.

334
00:29:25,724 --> 00:29:27,935
Thanks for the tip. You got business,
or you out for a stroll?

335
00:29:28,018 --> 00:29:30,854
-Dylan.
-What? I think you guys are cool,

336
00:29:30,938 --> 00:29:34,358
and I'm just wondering what you're up to.
It's rare seeing you out of your hole.

337
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:37,236
Egg drop challenge
in the team-building space.

338
00:29:38,153 --> 00:29:40,447
Tight department like us
gotta keep our synergy up.

339
00:29:40,531 --> 00:29:43,033
Egg drop challenge.
You buy this fucking shit?

340
00:29:43,116 --> 00:29:44,785
-And what are you guys doing?
-Felicia.

341
00:29:44,868 --> 00:29:48,038
Perpetuity wing visit.
This is Helly, our new refiner.

342
00:29:48,121 --> 00:29:49,456
-This is--
-Welcome, Helly.

343
00:29:50,499 --> 00:29:55,671
Well, we should get back.
Can't leave the nest empty.

344
00:29:56,713 --> 00:29:58,006
Good to see you, O&D.

345
00:30:00,175 --> 00:30:01,510
Those eggs look like shit.

346
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:08,642
Irving, come on.

347
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:17,651
Seth?

348
00:30:23,615 --> 00:30:24,783
Natalie.

349
00:30:24,867 --> 00:30:26,869
Harmony, hello.

350
00:30:27,494 --> 00:30:30,706
I wasn't expecting-- Is this about Helena?

351
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:33,417
No, this is about Peter Kilmer.

352
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,044
And I should tell you
that the Board is joining us.

353
00:31:03,614 --> 00:31:05,532
The Board would like you to speak first.

354
00:31:05,616 --> 00:31:07,117
Oh, yes. Of course.

355
00:31:07,701 --> 00:31:09,036
Salutations.

356
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:17,669
So the search for Kilmer continues.

357
00:31:24,426 --> 00:31:26,178
I will say this.

358
00:31:26,261 --> 00:31:29,431
Not to be alarmist,
but prior to his departure,

359
00:31:29,515 --> 00:31:34,394
there were some troubling signs
of possible… reintegration.

360
00:31:47,908 --> 00:31:48,909
Okay.

361
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:52,037
So, the Board is conveying pretty strongly

362
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:55,374
that the severance procedure is
provenly irreversible.

363
00:31:56,291 --> 00:31:57,292
Yes--

364
00:31:57,376 --> 00:32:01,255
And that this knowledge should be a given
for a person managing a severed floor.

365
00:32:01,338 --> 00:32:02,506
Yes, of course.

366
00:32:02,589 --> 00:32:05,592
While, of course, getting MDR
to their projected numbers

367
00:32:05,676 --> 00:32:07,845
by the quarterly deadline in three weeks.

368
00:32:07,928 --> 00:32:09,596
Yes, of course.

369
00:32:10,514 --> 00:32:15,269
We are quickly rekindling our yield
down here with our nimble new refiner.

370
00:32:15,853 --> 00:32:18,772
-And for what it's worth, I'd like--
-The Board has concluded the call.

371
00:32:21,483 --> 00:32:24,069
Yes, okay. Thank you.

372
00:32:26,071 --> 00:32:28,282
-And may I ask--
-Goodbye, Harmony.

373
00:32:34,454 --> 00:32:37,833
There's seriously a two-person department?
Like, they only ever see each other?

374
00:32:37,916 --> 00:32:41,128
For the most part. It's lonely, I suspect.

375
00:32:41,211 --> 00:32:43,213
And unnatural. Perverse.

376
00:32:43,297 --> 00:32:44,381
O&D is nice.

377
00:32:44,464 --> 00:32:47,217
No, they're not.
Nor do they share our values.

378
00:32:47,301 --> 00:32:49,261
Kier sorted the departments by virtue.

379
00:32:49,344 --> 00:32:53,056
Macrodats are clever and true,
while O&D's more cruelty-centered.

380
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,266
How many departments are there?

381
00:32:54,349 --> 00:32:55,475
-Probably 30.
-Around five.

382
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:56,935
No one's quite sure.

383
00:32:57,019 --> 00:32:59,897
O&D tried a violent coup on the others
decades ago,

384
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,773
and that's why
they reduced them down to two.

385
00:33:01,857 --> 00:33:03,734
And that's why they keep us all
so far apart now.

386
00:33:03,817 --> 00:33:05,527
That's an absolute fiction.

387
00:33:05,611 --> 00:33:06,737
Did they ever kill anyone?

388
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:09,448
Nope. There was no coup.
No one killed anyone.

389
00:33:09,531 --> 00:33:11,617
Then why don't we ever hang out?

390
00:33:12,534 --> 00:33:14,870
I mean, I'm 99% sure there was no coup.

391
00:33:17,247 --> 00:33:20,042
If they come back and attack us,
I think we should kill Mark.

392
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:21,251
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

393
00:33:21,752 --> 00:33:23,712
So they think we're crazy
with nothing to lose.

394
00:33:23,795 --> 00:33:25,005
Smart. That's smart.

395
00:33:25,088 --> 00:33:28,091
Like, I'm imagining them rounding
a corner, and we're all blood-soaked,

396
00:33:28,175 --> 00:33:31,720
and I'm wearing your face,
and they're like, "Whose face is that?"

397
00:33:31,803 --> 00:33:35,057
And I'm like,
"The last person who fucked with us."

398
00:33:36,391 --> 00:33:38,769
And that's just feeling like
a really powerful image to me.

399
00:33:38,852 --> 00:33:42,272
Just-- Seems like
they'd recognize my face.

400
00:33:42,356 --> 00:33:43,857
Maybe if you wore it inside out?

401
00:33:53,867 --> 00:33:54,868
We're here.

402
00:34:10,676 --> 00:34:13,303
"Come now, children of my industry,

403
00:34:13,846 --> 00:34:16,764
and know the children of my blood."

404
00:34:19,601 --> 00:34:20,601
Whoa.

405
00:34:21,478 --> 00:34:27,734
That's Jame Eagan.
Current CEO. Remarkable man.

406
00:34:28,569 --> 00:34:31,530
Handsome too. See those brows?

407
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:58,307
All the center displays are for
a past Eagan CEO.

408
00:34:59,057 --> 00:35:01,935
But the whole back part is Kier.

409
00:35:25,209 --> 00:35:28,295
I know that death is near upon me,

410
00:35:28,378 --> 00:35:34,593
because people have begun to ask
what I see as my life's great achievement.

411
00:35:35,177 --> 00:35:40,516
They wish to know
how they should remember me as I rot.

412
00:35:41,266 --> 00:35:48,106
In my life, I have identified
four components, which I call tempers,

413
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:52,236
from which are derived every human soul.

414
00:35:52,819 --> 00:35:58,242
Woe. Frolic. Dread. Malice.

415
00:35:59,076 --> 00:36:04,790
Each man's character is defined
by the precise ratio

416
00:36:04,873 --> 00:36:06,583
that resides in him.

417
00:36:07,376 --> 00:36:12,881
I walked into the cave
of my own mind, and there I tamed them.

418
00:36:12,965 --> 00:36:17,469
Should you tame the tempers as I did mine,

419
00:36:17,553 --> 00:36:21,306
then the world shall become
but your appendage.

420
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:25,102
It is this great and consecrated power

421
00:36:25,185 --> 00:36:30,482
that I hope to pass on
to all of you, my children.

422
00:36:32,693 --> 00:36:34,862
I think that to be an Eagan,

423
00:36:34,945 --> 00:36:39,783
either a true Eagan
or anyone working in this Lumon family,

424
00:36:39,867 --> 00:36:42,744
what you are is the keeper of an ethos,

425
00:36:42,828 --> 00:36:47,583
a compact of values
that we have long held as precious,

426
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:51,795
and which I do believe
will one day save this world.

427
00:36:51,879 --> 00:36:54,298
And that ethos goes all the way back

428
00:36:54,381 --> 00:36:56,091
-through my blood…
-Look, you got one.

429
00:36:56,175 --> 00:36:58,468
…to where we all started, with Kier.

430
00:36:58,552 --> 00:37:00,846
-It's okay if you cry.
-When I was a girl,

431
00:37:01,513 --> 00:37:03,140
my father would make me whisper…

432
00:37:03,223 --> 00:37:05,726
She was five CEOs ago.

433
00:37:07,102 --> 00:37:08,729
They'd never had a woman before.

434
00:37:09,479 --> 00:37:14,359
And she told her father at age seven,
she was going to be the first.

435
00:37:14,443 --> 00:37:16,069
Vision. Verve.

436
00:37:16,153 --> 00:37:17,696
-Isn't that lovely?
-Wit.

437
00:37:17,779 --> 00:37:19,031
-It's beautiful.
-Cheer.

438
00:37:19,656 --> 00:37:22,910
It almost makes me wish
I remembered my own childhood.

439
00:37:22,993 --> 00:37:27,789
Nimbleness. Probity. Wiles.

440
00:37:28,624 --> 00:37:33,962
It's an unnatural state
for a person to have no history.

441
00:37:34,463 --> 00:37:40,010
History makes us someone.
Gives us a context. A shape.

442
00:37:40,677 --> 00:37:44,932
But waking up on that table,
I was shapeless.

443
00:37:47,017 --> 00:37:52,189
But then I learned
that I work for a company

444
00:37:52,272 --> 00:37:58,278
that has been actively caring
for mankind since 1866.

445
00:37:59,029 --> 00:38:00,113
Look.

446
00:38:00,197 --> 00:38:05,536
Each of these is a real smile
from someone on the outside.

447
00:38:06,245 --> 00:38:09,414
Someone Lumon Industries has helped.

448
00:38:10,082 --> 00:38:12,417
And they rotate these through.

449
00:38:12,501 --> 00:38:16,797
The true number of smiles may well be
in the millions.

450
00:38:18,549 --> 00:38:20,342
So what are we, like, a dental company?

451
00:38:20,425 --> 00:38:21,552
No.

452
00:38:21,635 --> 00:38:24,638
My point is you're part of a history now.

453
00:38:24,721 --> 00:38:27,266
-A noble one.
-And that's so much more mea--

454
00:38:27,349 --> 00:38:28,433
They update the mouth wall?

455
00:38:28,934 --> 00:38:31,645
It's not called the "mouth wall."

456
00:38:31,728 --> 00:38:33,647
Damn, they took down the chick I like.

457
00:38:34,189 --> 00:38:36,275
-Are you guys ready to go?
-We just got here.

458
00:38:38,193 --> 00:38:40,654
She hasn't even seen the Kier part yet.

459
00:38:44,867 --> 00:38:45,868
Gerhardt.

460
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:02,718
-Jesus.
-No. Kier.

461
00:39:03,927 --> 00:39:04,970
It's his house?

462
00:39:05,053 --> 00:39:07,055
A perfect replica.

463
00:39:07,139 --> 00:39:08,140
Pretty cool, huh?

464
00:39:09,266 --> 00:39:11,268
Yeah, pretty cool.

465
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:45,219
The bedroom of Kier,
just as he might have left it.

466
00:39:49,598 --> 00:39:50,974
Well, this is thorough.

467
00:39:51,975 --> 00:39:55,687
I hate this place.
It smells like 19th century ass.

468
00:39:55,771 --> 00:39:59,274
Stop treating this
like some kind of beer party.

469
00:39:59,358 --> 00:40:01,568
That's not fair.
Up till now, I've been reverent as shit.

470
00:40:03,487 --> 00:40:04,488
-Mark.
-Yeah?

471
00:40:06,949 --> 00:40:10,744
Were you about to… bed sit?

472
00:40:10,827 --> 00:40:13,497
No. Nuh-uh.

473
00:40:15,874 --> 00:40:18,752
What's that in your pocket, Mark?

474
00:40:20,712 --> 00:40:21,713
I--

475
00:40:22,589 --> 00:40:26,218
Oh, God, Mark. Still?

476
00:40:27,845 --> 00:40:29,680
It's… for fun.

477
00:40:29,763 --> 00:40:31,265
It's the perpetuity wing.

478
00:40:31,974 --> 00:40:33,684
It's the Eagans.

479
00:40:33,767 --> 00:40:38,105
It's the living soul of Lumon
and everything she stands for,

480
00:40:38,188 --> 00:40:39,565
not a bingo match.

481
00:40:39,648 --> 00:40:43,277
Look, Kier said,
"Keep a merry humor ever in your heart."

482
00:40:44,194 --> 00:40:45,863
Did you give one to the trainee?

483
00:40:47,447 --> 00:40:48,448
Of course, you did.

484
00:40:49,867 --> 00:40:52,035
She's starved for meaning here.

485
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:54,705
So, of course, you'd pervert
our founder's message

486
00:40:54,788 --> 00:40:57,207
with jokes and impiety.

487
00:40:57,291 --> 00:41:01,253
That's definitely what she needs
from her department chief.

488
00:41:01,336 --> 00:41:03,172
Hey, I didn't want to be department chief.

489
00:41:03,255 --> 00:41:05,924
I didn't ask for Petey to disappear
and for--

490
00:41:10,888 --> 00:41:11,889
Helly?

491
00:41:13,724 --> 00:41:14,725
Uh-oh.

492
00:41:15,517 --> 00:41:16,518
Helly?

493
00:41:17,269 --> 00:41:18,854
Shit.

494
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:48,091
Helly!

495
00:41:52,596 --> 00:41:54,765
This is… Jesus.

496
00:42:15,869 --> 00:42:16,870
Helly!

497
00:42:30,175 --> 00:42:31,385
Helly!

498
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,641
Helly!

499
00:42:40,435 --> 00:42:41,770
No!

500
00:42:43,939 --> 00:42:45,816
Goddamn it, Helly.

501
00:42:57,911 --> 00:42:59,663
This way, please, Helly R.

502
00:43:39,703 --> 00:43:40,704
On you go.

503
00:44:14,947 --> 00:44:16,949
I'm truly sorry to see you here, Helly.

504
00:44:27,835 --> 00:44:29,503
I hoped you'd just settle in.

505
00:44:32,089 --> 00:44:35,342
I know Mark's been trying so hard
to get you to feel happy.

506
00:44:43,934 --> 00:44:48,772
Look, you seem like a smart person.
But don't you see how fucked up this is?

507
00:44:49,273 --> 00:44:50,691
-You can't keep--
-Not right now, Helly.

508
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:55,237
Sit. Please.

509
00:45:11,545 --> 00:45:13,088
Hands on the table, please.

510
00:45:52,461 --> 00:45:54,963
I'm bringing up the compunction statement
for Helly R.

511
00:46:01,553 --> 00:46:02,554
What is this?

512
00:46:06,225 --> 00:46:07,226
Read it.

513
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,688
I don't want to.

514
00:46:13,273 --> 00:46:15,275
No. Do.

515
00:46:21,823 --> 00:46:25,369
"Forgive me for the harm
I have caused this world.

516
00:46:26,411 --> 00:46:29,831
None may atone for my actions but me,

517
00:46:29,915 --> 00:46:32,626
and only in me shall their stain live on.

518
00:46:33,836 --> 00:46:36,505
I am thankful to have been caught,

519
00:46:36,588 --> 00:46:38,966
my fall cut short
by those with wizened hands.

520
00:46:39,633 --> 00:46:41,760
All I can be is sorry,
and that is all I am."

521
00:46:45,889 --> 00:46:47,391
I'm afraid you don't mean it.

522
00:46:49,351 --> 00:46:50,352
Excuse me?

523
00:46:52,062 --> 00:46:53,230
Again, please.

524
00:46:56,024 --> 00:46:58,694
"Forgive me for the harm
I have caused this world.

525
00:47:00,112 --> 00:47:02,990
None may atone for my actions but me,

526
00:47:04,032 --> 00:47:07,327
and only in me shall their stain live on.

527
00:47:07,911 --> 00:47:09,955
I am thankful to have been caught,

528
00:47:10,539 --> 00:47:13,208
my fall cut short
by those with wizened hands.

529
00:47:14,042 --> 00:47:16,879
All I can be is sorry,
and that is all I am."

530
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:24,428
Again.

531
00:47:27,181 --> 00:47:28,182
Really?

532
00:47:33,687 --> 00:47:34,688
Fun day.

533
00:47:36,648 --> 00:47:37,649
See you tomorrow.

534
00:47:39,651 --> 00:47:40,652
Yeah.

535
00:47:42,362 --> 00:47:43,614
Do you want me to get these?

536
00:47:44,907 --> 00:47:45,908
Yeah, go ahead.

537
00:50:02,169 --> 00:50:05,964
I haven't any tokens.
I can't eat with no tokens.

538
00:50:13,639 --> 00:50:14,640
Hey!

539
00:50:15,724 --> 00:50:17,434
I need tokens so I can eat!

540
00:50:27,152 --> 00:50:28,028
Oh, my God.

541
00:51:34,386 --> 00:51:35,387
Petey?

542
00:51:41,602 --> 00:51:42,603
Petey?

543
00:53:05,936 --> 00:53:07,354
All right now. Take it slow.

544
00:53:11,692 --> 00:53:13,652
Did you happen to see
which direction he came from?

545
00:53:15,737 --> 00:53:17,781
I'm just gonna grab the stretcher.
I'll be right back.

546
00:53:18,323 --> 00:53:19,616
Can you get an ID on this guy?

547
00:53:23,245 --> 00:53:26,540
I guess he's from nearby.
He came in with a robe on. That was it.

548
00:53:38,594 --> 00:53:39,803
He's down. He's down.

549
00:53:39,887 --> 00:53:42,014
Sir. Sir, sir, sir. Can you hear me?

550
00:53:42,097 --> 00:53:43,682
You got that? Just stand back.

551
00:53:43,765 --> 00:53:48,562
Yeah, dispatch, I got a 10-53
at a convenience store on 42nd.

552
00:53:48,645 --> 00:53:49,897
Call that in, please.

553
00:53:51,523 --> 00:53:53,692
-Is he breathing?
-No, he's not breathing, man.

554
00:53:53,775 --> 00:53:55,110
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Give me the bpm.

555
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:59,239
-You okay? You okay?
-Get him on the board.
