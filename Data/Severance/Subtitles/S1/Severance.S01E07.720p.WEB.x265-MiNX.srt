1
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:13,598
Who are you?

2
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:17,852
Come with me.

3
00:01:11,823 --> 00:01:14,992
You could've thrown away Petey's phone
weeks ago. Why didn't you?

4
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,745
I'm sorry, just-- Who are you?

5
00:01:17,829 --> 00:01:19,664
I'm the one who helped your friend.

6
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:22,959
Helped? You mean reintegration?
It killed him.

7
00:01:23,043 --> 00:01:25,045
The procedure didn't kill Petey.

8
00:01:25,128 --> 00:01:27,046
If he had followed my post-op instructions

9
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:29,674
and not simply run away
at the first sign of sickness--

10
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:31,384
So, you-- You're a doctor?

11
00:01:33,637 --> 00:01:35,472
I put that chip in your head,

12
00:01:35,555 --> 00:01:38,140
and I'm still the only one
who can deactivate it.

13
00:01:46,691 --> 00:01:48,526
Maybe I don't want it deactivated.

14
00:01:49,194 --> 00:01:52,112
Right. Well, maybe your innie does.

15
00:01:52,781 --> 00:01:56,575
You wonder what he thinks about all this,
don't you? You wonder if he's happy?

16
00:01:57,326 --> 00:02:00,579
I hate that term, "innie."
So infantilizing.

17
00:02:01,706 --> 00:02:04,334
Then again, you've been severed
for two years, right?

18
00:02:04,417 --> 00:02:06,710
So your innie really is still just a baby.

19
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:13,759
My innie lives his own life and,
as a result, I get to live mine.

20
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,764
But he only exists because of you.

21
00:02:17,847 --> 00:02:20,975
And for all intents and purposes,
he is you.

22
00:02:23,853 --> 00:02:25,896
Do you really think
he's different down there?

23
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,693
Combs his hair differently,
laughs at different jokes?

24
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:33,028
Maybe he loves it, you're right.

25
00:02:33,655 --> 00:02:35,073
But maybe he doesn't.

26
00:02:36,408 --> 00:02:40,453
Maybe he dreams every day
about clawing his way to the surface.

27
00:02:42,581 --> 00:02:46,918
But you wouldn't know. You'll never know.

28
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:53,383
You brought him into this world
without his permission,

29
00:02:54,175 --> 00:02:57,596
based on your own desire
for emotional convenience.

30
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:03,435
I'm not a bad person.

31
00:03:04,436 --> 00:03:06,687
I think you wanna do what's right.

32
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,566
Both of you.

33
00:03:14,612 --> 00:03:15,780
Mr. Scout.

34
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:21,161
Do I know you?

35
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:24,997
We work together. Down there.

36
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:31,212
You having a chat with someone, Mark?

37
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:36,759
It's okay. I'm a friend.

38
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,221
Shit!

39
00:03:40,722 --> 00:03:42,223
What the fuck are you doing?

40
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:47,853
-Grab his arms.
-What?

41
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,481
Come here. His arms.

42
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:56,987
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

43
00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:00,116
Oh, fuck! Oh, my God.

44
00:04:03,662 --> 00:04:05,872
Fuck. Oh, God.

45
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:08,667
I work with him.

46
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,252
No, you don't.

47
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,590
He's Doug Graner.
Head of security on the severed floor.

48
00:04:15,674 --> 00:04:17,341
Security? Oh, my God.

49
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,762
Okay, I'm gonna get sick.
I need to throw up.

50
00:04:20,845 --> 00:04:24,266
-I'm gonna throw up right now.
-Don't! Don't! Don't!

51
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:25,559
Your DNA's in that!

52
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,817
Look, Graner's security card.

53
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:36,860
Full access,
and it can't be tied to anyone.

54
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:39,697
Take it to work tomorrow.
He'll know what to do.

55
00:04:40,365 --> 00:04:41,740
Who'll know what to do?

56
00:04:41,824 --> 00:04:42,992
You.

57
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:48,163
Give me the phone.
Petey's phone. Give it to me.

58
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,207
I'll take care of this.

59
00:04:51,584 --> 00:04:53,961
Go home, get rid of your clothes.

60
00:04:55,213 --> 00:04:56,213
Go now.

61
00:05:04,014 --> 00:05:07,057
I'll be in touch. It's gonna be okay.

62
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:09,226
We'll finish what Petey started, Mark.

63
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:11,937
Now get the fuck out of here!

64
00:08:09,074 --> 00:08:10,908
-Oh, hey.
-Hey.

65
00:08:10,992 --> 00:08:13,452
Just getting some water.
Do you need anything?

66
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:15,038
Where were you?

67
00:08:15,872 --> 00:08:16,872
Who, me?

68
00:08:17,499 --> 00:08:19,000
-Yeah.
-Just--

69
00:08:19,084 --> 00:08:20,334
I heard the car.

70
00:08:22,963 --> 00:08:24,129
You heard a car?

71
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:33,721
You're being weird.

72
00:08:36,518 --> 00:08:38,519
Maybe it was just a dream.

73
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,441
I've been up for an hour,
and you weren't here.

74
00:08:48,738 --> 00:08:50,030
Okay, just--

75
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:53,659
I'm sorry, I…

76
00:08:55,662 --> 00:08:58,831
I just needed to drive a little.

77
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,251
Are you okay?

78
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:11,344
Well, I mean,
this is kind of a big deal for me. And…

79
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:16,932
I don't know. It's--

80
00:09:22,105 --> 00:09:23,315
Do you want me to go?

81
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:28,736
Maybe.

82
00:09:30,822 --> 00:09:31,947
Maybe.

83
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,253
Fucking shit.

84
00:10:28,797 --> 00:10:29,838
Mark!

85
00:10:30,465 --> 00:10:33,759
-Hey.
-You're out early in all this snowiness.

86
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:38,222
You usually dispose of your waste
in the early afternoon.

87
00:10:38,306 --> 00:10:43,394
Oh, well, just
getting a head start on the day, I guess.

88
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:46,438
You look troubled, Mark.

89
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:53,572
Maybe we should talk later
over a nice hot cup of lavender tea?

90
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:58,618
Yeah. I'm just gonna see
how the day goes, you know?

91
00:10:59,619 --> 00:11:03,789
Jack Frost certainly needs
some new dandruff shampoo.

92
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:30,793
Burt G.

93
00:12:31,461 --> 00:12:34,755
Mr. Milchick. Pleasure to see you, sir.

94
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:36,423
-So early.
-Please, sit.

95
00:12:36,508 --> 00:12:37,509
Thank you.

96
00:12:38,176 --> 00:12:39,719
I have something for you.

97
00:12:40,636 --> 00:12:43,431
The missing 7199-G.

98
00:12:43,514 --> 00:12:47,309
Oswald will be so delighted.
I, too, am delighted.

99
00:12:47,394 --> 00:12:50,145
Oh, good. Now we can focus on
the final preparations.

100
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:52,231
-That we can.
-Without interruptions.

101
00:12:52,315 --> 00:12:54,359
-That we shall.
-Excellent.

102
00:12:58,697 --> 00:13:00,490
-May I?
-Yes, of course.

103
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:07,581
Outstanding.

104
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:08,914
-Yep.
-Wow.

105
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:12,668
You've been a great leader
to this department, Burt G.

106
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:13,753
Thank you.

107
00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:15,629
You deserve something special.

108
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:20,051
Not-- Not a trip
to the break room, I hope.

109
00:13:20,134 --> 00:13:21,845
Yesterday was quite enough.

110
00:13:25,432 --> 00:13:30,519
No. No, not that. Something else.
Stay tuned.

111
00:13:38,445 --> 00:13:41,405
Dylan G. Good morning.

112
00:13:43,033 --> 00:13:44,158
What the hell was that?

113
00:13:44,701 --> 00:13:45,744
Walk with me.

114
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:52,167
What happened last night
is called the overtime contingency.

115
00:13:52,834 --> 00:13:57,129
It's a safeguard we occasionally employ
to remotely awaken workers off-site.

116
00:13:57,213 --> 00:13:59,256
You never told us you could do that.

117
00:13:59,341 --> 00:14:00,799
It's for emergency use only.

118
00:14:01,634 --> 00:14:04,471
And I didn't consult Ms. Cobel
because she's been so stressed.

119
00:14:05,263 --> 00:14:08,350
The boy. Was he-- Was that my son?

120
00:14:12,604 --> 00:14:15,565
He'd agreed to count to a thousand,
which he then violated.

121
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,072
I really wouldn't mention this
to your colleagues, Dylan.

122
00:14:22,739 --> 00:14:26,451
This OTC's pretty need-to-know.
Understand?

123
00:14:31,206 --> 00:14:32,539
Can you tell me his name?

124
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,836
Not knowing is probably for the best.

125
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:43,717
Hey, I know this has been a tough quarter.

126
00:14:44,469 --> 00:14:47,304
I'm gonna see about rustling you up
some special perks.

127
00:14:48,807 --> 00:14:49,975
That sound good?

128
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,567
Good man, Dylan. Good man.

129
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:55,206
Mark S. Good morning.

130
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,417
Good morning.

131
00:16:02,172 --> 00:16:03,548
So, am I going to the--

132
00:16:03,631 --> 00:16:05,549
I'm here to escort you to your desk.

133
00:16:06,384 --> 00:16:07,469
New protocol.

134
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:10,304
Sounds good.

135
00:16:11,431 --> 00:16:12,432
Lead the way.

136
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:56,809
Wait, we're locked in now?

137
00:16:56,893 --> 00:16:59,437
I prefer the phrase, "safely situated."

138
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:04,608
These doors help us to ensure you all are
tucked nicely in your work spaces.

139
00:17:04,692 --> 00:17:06,443
Did Mr. Graner order this?

140
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:10,406
Mark S. is here.

141
00:17:10,489 --> 00:17:11,490
Have a seat.

142
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:14,785
-I…
-Coffee. Black. I'll bring it to you.

143
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:16,328
Good morning, Mark.

144
00:17:17,497 --> 00:17:18,998
-Morning.
-Morning.

145
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:21,834
Mark, what is this?

146
00:17:26,673 --> 00:17:27,673
How're you doing, Irv?

147
00:17:27,757 --> 00:17:29,884
I'm well, thank you. I--

148
00:17:29,968 --> 00:17:33,305
The renovations are… very nice.

149
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:34,806
Yeah.

150
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,016
Dylan, you all right?

151
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:38,018
I'm fine.

152
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,355
That's the best you can do?
Where's the sly, profanity-laced comeback?

153
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:47,903
Here you go.
Straight from the hills of Rwanda.

154
00:17:51,155 --> 00:17:52,156
Thanks.

155
00:17:57,453 --> 00:18:00,832
Hey, it's me. Don't know if you heard,
but Graner didn't come in.

156
00:18:00,915 --> 00:18:03,417
Everything's fine,
just wondering where you are.

157
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,342
So I lean my upper body slightly forward,

158
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:13,178
while cradling the top of the neck,
just so.

159
00:18:15,346 --> 00:18:19,517
Exhale softly. Just a whisper of a breeze.

160
00:18:20,268 --> 00:18:23,688
Then I do this, and this.

161
00:18:24,355 --> 00:18:29,152
Show the baby the areola, and we latch.

162
00:18:30,653 --> 00:18:31,904
Now you try.

163
00:18:33,198 --> 00:18:34,199
All right.

164
00:18:34,824 --> 00:18:36,867
You ready? You ready, buddy?

165
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:39,746
Okay.

166
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:44,584
-Yeah, expose the areola. Let her see it.
-Okay.

167
00:18:44,667 --> 00:18:48,003
-She's--
-There she is.

168
00:18:48,087 --> 00:18:51,340
-Yes, Eleanor, yes! Yes.
-Oh, my God.

169
00:18:52,259 --> 00:18:56,221
Baby sips, baby sips.

170
00:18:59,432 --> 00:19:05,313
So she goes into the airport restroom
to try to hand express.

171
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:11,236
She gets into the stall, and
she's trying to do it in the toilet paper,

172
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:14,154
but it's just flying everywhere.

173
00:19:14,239 --> 00:19:17,241
-Yes, like an angry fire hose.
-Oh, no!

174
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:20,202
Stop.

175
00:19:21,288 --> 00:19:26,041
Oh, God. Thank you for helping me.

176
00:19:27,626 --> 00:19:29,378
Did you say you need to get to the store?

177
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:34,634
They can do without me. I'm having fun.

178
00:19:34,718 --> 00:19:38,512
Besides, it's not as if you have
a fleet of nannies and manservants

179
00:19:38,596 --> 00:19:40,682
coming to take care of you, do you?

180
00:19:40,765 --> 00:19:41,766
Nope.

181
00:19:45,979 --> 00:19:48,272
I met this rich woman
at the birthing retreat.

182
00:19:48,856 --> 00:19:50,983
I guess her husband's a state senator.

183
00:19:51,067 --> 00:19:52,359
Oh, wow.

184
00:19:52,443 --> 00:19:56,823
I know, but it was weird 'cause I saw her
again at the park a few days later,

185
00:19:56,906 --> 00:19:59,159
and she 100% didn't remember me.

186
00:19:59,742 --> 00:20:01,243
What a snoot.

187
00:20:02,037 --> 00:20:03,038
Yeah.

188
00:20:04,663 --> 00:20:08,375
Like-- I don't know. This is stupid.

189
00:20:11,337 --> 00:20:16,092
Mark's company, Lumon, they say
that they only sever people for work.

190
00:20:16,843 --> 00:20:20,096
But I was thinking, what if someone--

191
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,683
Like, what if you wanted a baby,
but you didn't wanna--

192
00:20:26,769 --> 00:20:27,770
I don't know.

193
00:20:30,941 --> 00:20:33,943
Well, I don't think
I'd remember even Clark Gable

194
00:20:34,027 --> 00:20:35,612
if I'd just given birth, so…

195
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:38,280
Yeah.

196
00:20:43,662 --> 00:20:44,746
Severed.

197
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,708
Why do you think Mark did it?

198
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:53,712
Well, it was right after he lost his wife.

199
00:20:56,633 --> 00:20:59,719
At first, he tried to keep teaching
at the college, but he couldn't.

200
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:04,182
Does he ever talk about her?

201
00:21:04,932 --> 00:21:06,183
Not as much as I'd wish.

202
00:21:08,019 --> 00:21:11,355
When my husband passed,
I thought I saw him everywhere.

203
00:21:11,439 --> 00:21:13,607
It was just so hard.

204
00:21:15,777 --> 00:21:17,778
Does Mark ever think he sees her?

205
00:21:31,542 --> 00:21:32,544
Hey.

206
00:21:33,586 --> 00:21:34,587
Hey.

207
00:21:34,671 --> 00:21:36,548
-I was just in the bathroom.
-Yeah?

208
00:21:36,631 --> 00:21:40,969
Yeah. Hey, what ever happened
to the soap labels?

209
00:21:41,845 --> 00:21:42,971
-The soap labels?
-Yeah.

210
00:21:43,054 --> 00:21:48,101
Shouldn't there be labels
on the soap dispensers saying, "soap"?

211
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:49,810
There's never been that.

212
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:51,980
We all know it's soap.

213
00:21:54,023 --> 00:21:56,276
Seems like an O&amp;D question.

214
00:21:56,358 --> 00:22:00,029
Irv, you know we can't go anywhere.

215
00:22:00,113 --> 00:22:01,990
I mean, I get
that you're worried about Burt.

216
00:22:03,532 --> 00:22:07,037
Suppose he's being disciplined
for our visit?

217
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:08,997
Suppose he is, thanks to you.

218
00:22:10,123 --> 00:22:12,291
If only someone had told you

219
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:15,545
that going there was a shitty fucking idea
from the jump.

220
00:22:17,213 --> 00:22:19,340
Good day, Refiners!

221
00:22:20,342 --> 00:22:21,675
What's this?

222
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:24,721
It's an MDE.

223
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:27,265
She got to 75%?

224
00:22:32,811 --> 00:22:35,315
Helly R., please step forward.

225
00:22:37,025 --> 00:22:38,108
MDE?

226
00:22:38,192 --> 00:22:42,154
By reaching 75% refinement on Siena,
you have earned

227
00:22:42,239 --> 00:22:47,952
for you and your fellow refiners
a five-minute Music Dance Experience.

228
00:22:48,827 --> 00:22:52,958
Mr. Milchick, she's at 73%.

229
00:22:54,084 --> 00:22:56,169
Yes, well, it's been a tough morning
on all of us.

230
00:22:56,877 --> 00:22:59,172
-Why for you?
-And I thought a little frivolity

231
00:22:59,256 --> 00:23:01,258
would be just what the doctor ordered.

232
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,760
Helly, please approach the MDE cart.

233
00:23:06,846 --> 00:23:09,932
You may choose one genre
and one accessory.

234
00:23:15,188 --> 00:23:18,400
The maraca. Excellent choice.

235
00:23:18,482 --> 00:23:20,818
Should've gone for the castanets.

236
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:25,448
I choose "Defiant Jazz."

237
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:29,076
Though this experience
is in Helly's honor,

238
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,913
I urge all the refiners to take advantage
of the opportunity presented.

239
00:23:46,302 --> 00:23:47,304
Wow.

240
00:23:48,846 --> 00:23:49,847
Okay.

241
00:23:56,104 --> 00:23:57,105
Cheers.

242
00:23:57,814 --> 00:23:58,940
I'm nervous!

243
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:21,421
Come on, Mark.

244
00:24:42,317 --> 00:24:44,236
Irving, what you got? Let's see it.

245
00:25:29,948 --> 00:25:32,741
Daddy. Daddy. Daddy.

246
00:25:38,999 --> 00:25:42,251
-What is his name? Tell me his name!
-Dylan! Get him off me!

247
00:25:42,335 --> 00:25:43,336
Get him off me!

248
00:25:46,298 --> 00:25:48,799
-He's biting me!
-Dylan, what the hell!

249
00:25:48,884 --> 00:25:52,261
-Jesus Christ! Dylan! Come on, Dylan!
-He's biting me!

250
00:26:03,355 --> 00:26:04,566
He broke the skin.

251
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:07,277
He needs a full tetanus toxoid panel.

252
00:26:10,154 --> 00:26:13,450
You've done it now, Dylan.
I'm reporting this to Ms. Cobel.

253
00:26:14,241 --> 00:26:15,911
Yeah, you wanna go see her together?

254
00:26:30,174 --> 00:26:33,302
The Music Dance Experience
is officially canceled.

255
00:26:46,273 --> 00:26:47,733
What is wrong with you?

256
00:26:48,526 --> 00:26:49,778
They can wake us up.

257
00:26:50,737 --> 00:26:51,820
What?

258
00:26:52,989 --> 00:26:55,991
On the outside.
It's called the overtime contingency.

259
00:26:56,826 --> 00:26:58,161
What are you talking about?

260
00:26:58,912 --> 00:27:00,997
Last night, after I went up the elevator,

261
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,625
I woke up outside, in my house,
with Milchick.

262
00:27:05,751 --> 00:27:06,752
What?

263
00:27:09,381 --> 00:27:10,589
I saw my son.

264
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,888
And then he hugged me.

265
00:27:19,391 --> 00:27:21,226
He was so happy to see me.

266
00:27:23,603 --> 00:27:26,272
Then Milchick pulled him off,
and it was over.

267
00:27:28,357 --> 00:27:31,152
It happened so fast,
I just keep trying to remember more.

268
00:27:31,236 --> 00:27:34,364
-Jesus, Dylan. That's crazy.
-Yeah, it's not fair.

269
00:27:35,323 --> 00:27:38,117
And now I'm just supposed to
have that in my head every day here.

270
00:27:38,201 --> 00:27:39,702
And I never get to see him again.

271
00:27:39,786 --> 00:27:42,038
He's not your son, Dylan.
He's your outie's son.

272
00:27:42,122 --> 00:27:45,000
That's bullshit. He's my son too.

273
00:27:46,125 --> 00:27:48,920
This is good. We could use this.

274
00:27:49,003 --> 00:27:50,255
What?

275
00:27:50,337 --> 00:27:51,882
If they can wake us up on the outside,

276
00:27:51,964 --> 00:27:54,174
what's to stop us
from doing it to ourselves?

277
00:27:54,259 --> 00:27:55,926
What's to stop us?

278
00:27:56,845 --> 00:28:00,640
We can find whatever they use to
control it and, you know, commandeer it.

279
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:04,435
We can all see the outside,
find out who we are.

280
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:07,939
But, Helly, forgive me,
but that's perverse. We're innies.

281
00:28:08,022 --> 00:28:11,942
Plus, the controls are surely
somewhere we can't access.

282
00:28:13,153 --> 00:28:14,904
Like the security office?

283
00:28:16,906 --> 00:28:18,157
Is that…

284
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,451
Graner's key card?

285
00:28:20,117 --> 00:28:22,162
-Where did you find it?
-In my pocket

286
00:28:22,244 --> 00:28:23,829
during the Music Dance Experience.

287
00:28:23,913 --> 00:28:27,666
I think I must've had it with me
when I came in today.

288
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:30,336
Why does your outie have the key card
of our head of security?

289
00:28:34,673 --> 00:28:35,799
I don't know.

290
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,097
I think it's time for a field trip.

291
00:28:42,682 --> 00:28:45,184
To the security office
where all the security guards work?

292
00:28:45,268 --> 00:28:46,269
Amazing. Yeah.

293
00:28:46,353 --> 00:28:49,230
Who's to say there are security guards?
I've only ever seen Graner.

294
00:28:49,314 --> 00:28:52,067
-What about Milchick?
-He can't be everywhere at once.

295
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:54,903
-This whole line of con--
-Do you know where the office is?

296
00:28:55,903 --> 00:28:58,573
Petey saw it during a fire alarm
last year. He showed me.

297
00:29:02,243 --> 00:29:03,619
We can do this.

298
00:29:15,714 --> 00:29:18,134
Look, if Milchick does show up, stall him.

299
00:29:18,218 --> 00:29:19,385
-I got it.
-Okay.

300
00:29:32,523 --> 00:29:34,067
Hopefully this works.

301
00:29:46,829 --> 00:29:48,289
No cavalry yet.

302
00:29:48,957 --> 00:29:51,542
Okay, it's a ways past perpetuity, so--

303
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:52,626
Irving.

304
00:29:52,711 --> 00:29:53,795
I'm sorry, Mark.

305
00:29:53,878 --> 00:29:56,423
-Where you going?
-I have to make sure Burt's okay.

306
00:29:56,506 --> 00:29:57,632
What about the plan?

307
00:29:57,715 --> 00:30:00,594
I-- I'm sorry, Mark. I can't hear you!
I'll be back!

308
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,679
-I mean--
-What?

309
00:30:05,598 --> 00:30:06,599
Okay.

310
00:30:33,626 --> 00:30:34,836
It's this one.

311
00:31:16,044 --> 00:31:17,796
This is fucking weird.

312
00:31:27,055 --> 00:31:28,347
It's over here.

313
00:31:38,275 --> 00:31:39,608
Oh, my God.

314
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:47,075
Look, that's us.

315
00:31:48,951 --> 00:31:50,828
What's the name of that thing?
The oversight something?

316
00:31:50,912 --> 00:31:52,038
The overtime contingency.

317
00:31:58,252 --> 00:31:59,587
Shit.

318
00:32:08,387 --> 00:32:10,097
-Shit.
-What?

319
00:32:14,352 --> 00:32:15,644
It's Cobel.

320
00:32:15,729 --> 00:32:16,896
She won't come here.

321
00:32:18,397 --> 00:32:21,483
Okay. It's great you know that.
Let's get the fuck outta here.

322
00:32:35,248 --> 00:32:36,499
Harmony, I was looking for you.

323
00:32:36,583 --> 00:32:38,500
-Now isn't a good--
-I have the Board here.

324
00:32:39,544 --> 00:32:40,711
Right now?

325
00:32:41,337 --> 00:32:42,547
Doug Graner is dead.

326
00:32:46,468 --> 00:32:47,469
What?

327
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:50,387
The Board finds this deeply troubling.

328
00:32:51,181 --> 00:32:53,599
The Board wants to know
if you knew he was missing

329
00:32:53,682 --> 00:32:55,101
and if you've spoken to the police.

330
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:00,565
Whoever killed Mr. Graner is probably

331
00:33:00,648 --> 00:33:03,984
the same person
who reintegrated Peter Kilmer.

332
00:33:07,989 --> 00:33:09,657
The Board reminds you
that reintegration is not--

333
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:13,411
Reintegration happened.
And I have the data to prove it.

334
00:33:13,994 --> 00:33:19,041
And I would be happy
to share my findings in person

335
00:33:19,125 --> 00:33:21,294
without intermediaries.

336
00:33:28,384 --> 00:33:29,553
The Board agrees…

337
00:33:33,222 --> 00:33:36,768
and will be available to meet with you
at the Eagan Family Gala next week

338
00:33:36,851 --> 00:33:40,105
to discuss this further. Details to come.

339
00:33:50,656 --> 00:33:52,866
I look forward to receiving them.

340
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:33,532
So, no one is in there?
That's lax as fuck.

341
00:34:34,492 --> 00:34:37,494
Well, maybe it's enough that
we think we're constantly being watched.

342
00:34:37,579 --> 00:34:40,289
It's too bad nobody told you guys
that everything here is bullshit.

343
00:34:40,373 --> 00:34:42,123
-Is that making sense?
-Yeah.

344
00:34:42,708 --> 00:34:45,378
There's a bunch of steps,
but it's actually pretty straightforward.

345
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,755
You just engage the trackball,
type the code,

346
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:50,382
then it's switch, type, flip,

347
00:34:50,467 --> 00:34:52,219
-type, hold.
-What?

348
00:34:54,304 --> 00:34:57,681
Trackball, type, switch,
type, flip, type, hold. Boom.

349
00:34:58,724 --> 00:34:59,851
What?

350
00:34:59,934 --> 00:35:03,605
I'm smart. That's why I have three times
as many finger traps as you guys.

351
00:35:04,188 --> 00:35:07,192
But to do this,
one of us has to stay behind, right?

352
00:35:07,275 --> 00:35:10,402
Yeah, after work. I can do it.
I've already been out, so it's only fair.

353
00:35:10,487 --> 00:35:13,739
Very noble of you, but I think
it's designed as a two-man operation.

354
00:35:13,822 --> 00:35:15,492
Great. I have the strength of two men.

355
00:35:16,492 --> 00:35:18,077
It's not about strength.

356
00:35:18,661 --> 00:35:21,623
Yeah, see. There are two lever switches
that you have to hold open

357
00:35:21,706 --> 00:35:23,123
during the actual procedure.

358
00:35:24,125 --> 00:35:26,126
And they're on either side of the door.

359
00:35:28,505 --> 00:35:29,505
I can do it.

360
00:35:33,467 --> 00:35:35,135
Ladies and gentlemen,

361
00:35:35,219 --> 00:35:39,807
how about a round of applause
for the man of the hour?

362
00:35:42,268 --> 00:35:45,355
Come and circle up! Gather round.

363
00:35:45,438 --> 00:35:47,148
Burt, Burt, Burt.

364
00:35:56,532 --> 00:35:58,577
Greetings, Designers…

365
00:35:59,869 --> 00:36:01,454
and one Refiner.

366
00:36:03,956 --> 00:36:06,041
We'll have to get those doors looked at.

367
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:08,043
In the meantime…

368
00:36:08,753 --> 00:36:12,757
Burt G. This is for you.

369
00:36:19,806 --> 00:36:20,806
Hello.

370
00:36:22,851 --> 00:36:24,853
This is kinda strange, but…

371
00:36:26,855 --> 00:36:29,315
a lot of things about this job are.

372
00:36:29,815 --> 00:36:32,110
You all know that better than me,
I'm guessing.

373
00:36:32,193 --> 00:36:36,197
And, of course,
I don't really know any of you,

374
00:36:36,989 --> 00:36:39,576
but the man standing there
with you now does.

375
00:36:40,367 --> 00:36:43,704
He's worked with you
for nearly seven years,

376
00:36:43,788 --> 00:36:46,123
and I hope they've been good years.

377
00:36:46,206 --> 00:36:48,460
I-- I don't know what they've been like,

378
00:36:48,543 --> 00:36:51,713
or what exactly I, or he,
has been doing with you,

379
00:36:51,795 --> 00:36:57,510
but I do know how I feel
every day when I come from being with you.

380
00:36:58,344 --> 00:37:04,016
I come home feeling tired but fulfilled.
I feel satisfied.

381
00:37:04,099 --> 00:37:06,018
I must like you very much.

382
00:37:06,101 --> 00:37:09,021
And though today is my last day with you,

383
00:37:09,105 --> 00:37:12,858
I'm certain you will remain
with me in spirit

384
00:37:12,943 --> 00:37:18,489
in some deep, yet completely unaccessible,
corner of my mind.

385
00:37:18,989 --> 00:37:21,909
The impression you've left on me
is indelible,

386
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:25,454
though I'm unaware of it
on a conscious level, and…

387
00:37:25,996 --> 00:37:29,960
I will never forget any of you,
even though sitting here right now,

388
00:37:30,043 --> 00:37:33,630
I have no recollection
of actually ever meeting you

389
00:37:33,713 --> 00:37:36,257
and no idea of your names

390
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:39,219
or any of your physical characteristics

391
00:37:39,302 --> 00:37:42,054
or even how many of you there are.

392
00:37:42,137 --> 00:37:44,807
Anyway, I just wanna say, thank you, all.

393
00:37:44,891 --> 00:37:47,018
And Burt, I see you.

394
00:37:47,726 --> 00:37:49,771
Congratulations.

395
00:37:50,771 --> 00:37:52,148
Good job, buddy.

396
00:37:53,817 --> 00:37:55,150
Bon voyage.

397
00:38:11,001 --> 00:38:13,753
You're all just gonna stand here…

398
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:16,630
and let him die?

399
00:38:17,215 --> 00:38:18,465
Irving, what?

400
00:38:19,092 --> 00:38:24,556
Are we being punished
for defying the guidance of the founder?

401
00:38:25,139 --> 00:38:29,518
Burt's outie is retiring.
It'll happen to you too someday.

402
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:32,981
You smug motherfucker.

403
00:38:34,523 --> 00:38:35,983
You're not severed.

404
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:39,195
You walk out of here with your memories.

405
00:38:39,278 --> 00:38:41,780
You carry them home with you every night.

406
00:38:42,699 --> 00:38:45,911
No one can rip them away from you,
snuff them out.

407
00:38:46,577 --> 00:38:48,204
Like they never existed.

408
00:38:48,871 --> 00:38:50,581
Like you never existed!

409
00:38:50,664 --> 00:38:53,585
That's enough! You will go back to MDR.

410
00:38:53,668 --> 00:38:55,961
Mr. Milchick, please.

411
00:38:56,045 --> 00:38:58,590
It'd be so wonderful to have him here.

412
00:39:00,257 --> 00:39:01,675
He won't say anything more.

413
00:39:12,478 --> 00:39:15,898
You can stay for Burt's party
and support his transition.

414
00:39:16,565 --> 00:39:20,195
But only if you behave in a manner
that brings no shame upon yourself,

415
00:39:20,277 --> 00:39:22,030
the founder or his progeny.

416
00:39:25,449 --> 00:39:27,744
I don't know
what's gotten into you people today.

417
00:39:36,418 --> 00:39:39,672
Yes, Mr. Milchick.

418
00:39:41,173 --> 00:39:45,469
Now, let's all say goodbye to Burt.

419
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:58,315
I hope you all will enjoy Burt G.'s
innie retirement song selection.

420
00:40:16,293 --> 00:40:21,755
Good morning, yesterday

421
00:40:22,465 --> 00:40:28,221
You wake up
And time has slipped away

422
00:40:28,889 --> 00:40:32,349
And suddenly it's hard to find

423
00:40:32,434 --> 00:40:35,186
The memories you left behind

424
00:40:35,269 --> 00:40:40,900
Remember, do you remember?

425
00:40:41,483 --> 00:40:46,780
The laughter and the tears

426
00:40:47,532 --> 00:40:53,163
The shadows of misty yesteryears

427
00:40:53,746 --> 00:40:57,000
The good times and the bad you've seen

428
00:40:57,083 --> 00:41:00,170
And all the others in between

429
00:41:00,253 --> 00:41:04,673
Remember, do you remember

430
00:41:04,757 --> 00:41:08,427
The times of your life?

431
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:12,556
Do you remember?

432
00:41:12,641 --> 00:41:18,438
Reach back for the joy and the sorrow

433
00:41:19,231 --> 00:41:24,485
Put them away in your mind

434
00:41:25,195 --> 00:41:30,742
For memories are time that you borrow

435
00:41:31,451 --> 00:41:37,373
To spend when you get to tomorrow

436
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:45,047
Here comes the saddest part

437
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:47,050
Comes the saddest part

438
00:41:47,132 --> 00:41:52,137
The seasons are passing one by one

439
00:41:53,139 --> 00:41:56,434
So gather moments while you may

440
00:41:56,518 --> 00:41:59,436
Collect the dreams you dream today

441
00:41:59,521 --> 00:42:01,481
Remember

442
00:42:02,315 --> 00:42:07,278
Will you remember
The times of your life?

443
00:42:15,661 --> 00:42:16,663
Irving?

444
00:42:29,467 --> 00:42:32,219
Let's burn this place to the ground.

445
00:43:42,123 --> 00:43:43,541
-Hey.
-Hey.

446
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:47,211
My phone.

447
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:49,965
Right, yeah. Come on in.

448
00:43:56,179 --> 00:43:57,179
How are you?

449
00:43:57,806 --> 00:43:59,724
-I'm good. How are you?
-That's great.

450
00:43:59,807 --> 00:44:02,518
Come on in.
You know, make yourself at home.

451
00:44:04,603 --> 00:44:07,398
You know, I found it
between the wall and the bed.

452
00:44:09,442 --> 00:44:13,153
You know, I would've dropped it off,
but I don't know where you live.

453
00:44:13,237 --> 00:44:15,532
So, this is great.

454
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:20,452
Are you okay?

455
00:44:21,579 --> 00:44:24,873
Yeah. I'm fine. You know, a little tired.

456
00:44:26,668 --> 00:44:27,668
Okay. I'm gonna go.

457
00:44:27,751 --> 00:44:28,961
No, no. Come on.

458
00:44:29,045 --> 00:44:31,047
Hey, look.
I just don't think you're ready for this.

459
00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:33,215
-No, I think I'm really ready for this.
-No.

460
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,927
I don't think you're ready for anything.
I think you're a mess right now.

461
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:38,096
-Well, I'm really sorry.
-Okay.

462
00:44:38,179 --> 00:44:41,891
And I'm sorry for talking about her.

463
00:44:42,976 --> 00:44:44,603
No, it was too much. It was--

464
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:47,981
You know what? You can talk about her.
You can not talk about her.

465
00:44:48,063 --> 00:44:50,275
-Whatever you want.
-Okay. H-Hold on.

466
00:44:50,358 --> 00:44:51,358
Watch this.

467
00:45:00,869 --> 00:45:02,996
See? That's her.

468
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:15,592
Gone.

469
00:45:28,521 --> 00:45:29,521
What?

470
00:45:31,233 --> 00:45:33,150
Okay. Wow.

471
00:45:35,195 --> 00:45:39,074
Alexa, you know, we could--
We'll talk all about Gemma.

472
00:45:40,242 --> 00:45:43,702
She was great. She wa--

473
00:45:43,786 --> 00:45:45,288
Goodbye, Mark.

474
00:45:47,373 --> 00:45:48,500
Really?

475
00:45:50,751 --> 00:45:51,753
Oh, my--

476
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:14,358
She was great.

477
00:46:23,909 --> 00:46:25,411
She was extraordinary.

478
00:46:36,755 --> 00:46:42,429
I'll be seeing you

479
00:46:43,471 --> 00:46:50,103
In all the old familiar places

480
00:46:51,563 --> 00:46:58,402
That this heart of mine embraces

481
00:46:59,070 --> 00:47:02,824
All day through

482
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:12,626
In that small café

483
00:47:13,918 --> 00:47:19,925
The park across the way

484
00:47:21,675 --> 00:47:27,306
The children's carousel

485
00:47:28,599 --> 00:47:31,268
The chestnut tree

486
00:47:31,353 --> 00:47:34,731
My wife was extraordinary.

487
00:47:37,233 --> 00:47:42,572
I'll be seeing you

488
00:47:42,655 --> 00:47:45,867
My wife was allergic to nutmeg.

489
00:47:45,951 --> 00:47:49,871
In every lovely summer's day

490
00:47:49,954 --> 00:47:53,166
And when she sneezed,
she always sneezed twice.

491
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:58,380
In everything that's light and gay

492
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:00,715
My wife liked other people's dogs.

493
00:48:00,798 --> 00:48:04,344
I'll always think of you that way

494
00:48:04,427 --> 00:48:07,722
My wife thought
cardigans looked ridiculous.

495
00:48:07,806 --> 00:48:10,474
I'll find you…

496
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:12,561
I loved all these things about her…

497
00:48:16,106 --> 00:48:17,106
equally.

498
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:21,987
And when the night is new

499
00:48:23,445 --> 00:48:27,826
I'll be looking at the moon

500
00:48:28,577 --> 00:48:33,414
But I'll be seeing you

501
00:48:40,588 --> 00:48:47,429
I'll be seeing you

502
00:48:49,054 --> 00:48:55,061
In every lovely summer's day

503
00:48:57,146 --> 00:49:03,402
In everything that's light and gay

504
00:49:05,155 --> 00:49:11,286
I'll always think of you that way

505
00:49:12,369 --> 00:49:15,623
I'll find you

506
00:49:16,333 --> 00:49:20,170
In the morning sun

507
00:49:21,463 --> 00:49:27,385
And when the night is new

508
00:49:28,469 --> 00:49:33,432
I'll be looking at the moon

509
00:49:34,768 --> 00:49:41,608
But I'll be seeing you
