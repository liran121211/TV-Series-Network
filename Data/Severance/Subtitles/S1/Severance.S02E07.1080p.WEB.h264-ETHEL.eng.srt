1
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:52,218
All set.

2
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,556
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

3
00:01:04,188 --> 00:01:06,108
- What do you, uh, got there?
- Hmm?

4
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:08,068
Sorry. What do you… What do you got there?

5
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:13,824
Uh, themes of religious conversion
in Tolstoy's The Death of Ivan Ilyich.

6
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,784
Oh, my God. Spoiler alert, please.

7
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:17,077
What about you?

8
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:20,330
- Are you reading…
- Me? Uh, well… It's…

9
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:22,291
Oh, yeah, this is a real treat.

10
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:25,002
"All Quiet on the Western Blunt:

11
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:28,672
Drug Use by Enlisted Soldiers
during World War I."

12
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:31,258
- No, stop.
- No, that's… that's what it is.

13
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,468
Kid's a genius.
You should flunk every other child.

14
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:36,096
I couldn't agree more.

15
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:40,893
I'm sorry. Who are you?

16
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:44,062
Gemma.

17
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:49,610
- Uh… All right.
- Oh.

18
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:51,737
Mark.

19
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,490
- Nice to meet you, Mark.
- You too.

20
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:52,297
Gemma, where did you go?

21
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,214
He'll be okay.

22
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:36,633
There might be some deficits.

23
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:39,011
Hopefully, nothing long term.

24
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:40,095
Are you a doctor?

25
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,347
Do we need an ambulance?

26
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:46,059
C-Can you answer
one of my questions, please?

27
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:48,812
- Do we need an ambulance?
- No.

28
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,190
He's gonna sleep for a while.

29
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:52,733
Okay. How long?

30
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,109
Hard to say.

31
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:57,237
We'll need some equipment
from downstairs. Are you clumsy?

32
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:59,948
What? Why-Why do you
have equipment in Mark's basement?

33
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:02,409
Your brother's reintegrating.

34
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:04,536
No, he's not.

35
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,788
- I know that was troubling.
- Okay.

36
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:08,266
I can tell that you're smarter than me,

37
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,292
so forgive me if I say this,
like, super plainly,

38
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,504
but if you give one solitary thought
to messing with my brother again,

39
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,756
I will throw you off a fucking bridge.

40
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,050
- Devon--
- We don't do that again.

41
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:19,801
- We'll discuss it later.
- Nope!

42
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:22,804
No. It's settled fucking law, lady, okay?

43
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:24,097
Just accept it.

44
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,098
The end.

45
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:29,228
It's what he wants.

46
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,080
What he wants is to know
whether Gemma's alive or not.

47
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,104
She is.

48
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,443
Please don't mess with me.

49
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:38,987
She is alive.

50
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:44,363
You've eaten today, honey?

51
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:46,365
Yes.

52
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:50,077
Done your reading?

53
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,829
Fifty pages.

54
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,626
Calisthenics?

55
00:06:58,293 --> 00:06:59,503
Yes.

56
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:06,468
If you were caught in a mudslide,

57
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:10,264
would you be more afraid
of suffocating or drowning?

58
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:15,352
Drowning.

59
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:42,045
How many rooms today?

60
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:44,798
Six.

61
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:06,403
Shit.

62
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:16,473
Ready?

63
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:07,691
There she is.

64
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,821
Could I please get a break?

65
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:14,656
Just for a little while.

66
00:10:15,908 --> 00:10:17,451
But it's been six weeks.

67
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,205
I was just here.

68
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:23,332
I know.

69
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:26,627
Nobody likes the dentist.

70
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:30,005
I should have been an accountant
like my mom wanted.

71
00:10:33,217 --> 00:10:34,510
Please, have a seat.

72
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:01,662
Excellent.

73
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:10,003
Now, let's see how we're doing.

74
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:13,340
Open wide, please.

75
00:11:28,564 --> 00:11:30,065
How long was I in there?

76
00:11:30,566 --> 00:11:31,608
Two hours.

77
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:03,891
Okay.

78
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:12,774
Oh, bud.

79
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:14,109
I need you back, m'lady.

80
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:17,112
Please come back.

81
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:05,619
- Hey. Oh. Oh, bless you.
- Hey.

82
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,287
Excuse me.

83
00:13:07,371 --> 00:13:08,872
- Hi.
- Hey.

84
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,416
That was, uh, fun last night.

85
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,584
It was.

86
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,754
I'm sorry. I have a lecture at 3:00
on Hadji Murad

87
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:18,316
- and my notes are all over the place.
- Uh, no, no. That's… It's okay.

88
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:21,635
Um, I just… I brought you something.

89
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:24,680
Oh. Um…

90
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:27,015
It's an ant farm.

91
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:31,520
Last night you said you liked ants. So…

92
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:36,316
I said I liked… I like plants.

93
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,776
Plants.

94
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:42,364
- I hate ants.
- Oh, shit.

95
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:45,701
- But I… I love farms.
- Oh, good.

96
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:49,162
I'm so fucking behind.

97
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:51,540
- Aw. I'm not even here.
- Oh?

98
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:54,376
Y-You're not here? Okay.

99
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:56,295
What are you doing?

100
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:58,547
What are you doing? What are you doing?

101
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:07,138
Yeah.

102
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:12,769
- Really?
- Well, I mean, you know, it was on sale.

103
00:14:13,312 --> 00:14:17,733
And, um, who's putting it together,
Mr. Handyman? You?

104
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:19,985
I happen to be quite handy.

105
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:21,361
No, you're not.

106
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:23,780
- What? How dare you.
- Handsy.

107
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:24,948
Handsy?

108
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,911
Oh, all right. Maybe I am kinda handsy.

109
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:30,621
- Yeah?
- I like it.

110
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:29,263
Yeah. Well…

111
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:31,098
This is what
I was hoping would come up.

112
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:32,015
What happened?

113
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:34,059
It really, truly wasn't that bad.

114
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:36,395
For you. That's 'cause you can
scale walls like a gecko.

115
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:40,023
This… It was like half a mile
of just exposed rock face.

116
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:41,483
- Boulders. Fine.
- It sounds fun.

117
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,277
There were… There were a few boulders.

118
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,280
Boulders? Babe, come on.
It was like the death zone of Everest.

119
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:47,906
- Like Chomolungma.
- Mm-hmm.

120
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,825
- Any frozen bodies?
- No, I looked.

121
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:51,702
But I do have photo evidence.
Look at them.

122
00:15:52,578 --> 00:15:54,663
- Oh, my God. What's wrong with you?
- Look.

123
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:56,558
- Yeah, Ricken, what is wrong with you?
- Yeah.

124
00:15:56,582 --> 00:15:59,001
Hey, I belayed my first couloir
in middle school.

125
00:15:59,084 --> 00:15:59,918
- So, I…
- What?

126
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:01,253
Um, what?

127
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:03,231
- That sounds painful.
- We all know what that means.

128
00:16:03,255 --> 00:16:04,131
I'm sorry he said that.

129
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:06,258
Outdoorsmanship
courses through my veins.

130
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:07,819
- I think it's hot.
- I make no apology for it.

131
00:16:07,843 --> 00:16:09,469
Wait, how did you get down?

132
00:16:09,553 --> 00:16:11,889
- I scooted on my ass.
- Ooh. Are there photos of that?

133
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:12,890
No. It was a no-photo zone.

134
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:14,433
A no-photo death zone.

135
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:16,059
Exactly. Thank you.

136
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:18,520
You and I will ramble
together someday. The two of us.

137
00:16:18,604 --> 00:16:19,873
- It will be a grand adventure.
- Mm-mm.

138
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:21,899
I feel like we spend
a lot of time together.

139
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:23,692
- Not enough. No, Mark.
- Really?

140
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:25,461
- Are you not drinking?
- What are we gonna do there?

141
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,446
Did you know
you can purify urine into…

142
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:28,798
- Oh, fuck right off.
- …drinkable water?

143
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:29,948
Why would I do that?

144
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:32,743
To experience the beauty
and wonder of nature.

145
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:34,426
But why is it
you want to do this so bad?

146
00:16:34,453 --> 00:16:36,246
- Okay.
- I want to know you better.

147
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:39,499
W-Why is it you-you need
to have me come with you…

148
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:02,583
Hey, hon. Do you know
where I put the keys?

149
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:09,006
- Are you okay? Oh, baby.
- No.

150
00:18:30,903 --> 00:18:31,904
Ms. Casey.

151
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:34,531
I'm here to observe Helly R.

152
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,159
Oh. No one told me.

153
00:18:37,993 --> 00:18:42,289
Ms. Cobel's orders.
I am to watch her for signs of sadness,

154
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:45,584
and verbally encourage her
to forgo further suicide attempts.

155
00:19:58,448 --> 00:20:00,576
Are the severance barriers holding?

156
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:04,496
Yes, the technology is working.

157
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,960
You like her.

158
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:13,046
She's easy to like.

159
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:16,550
She is fond of me too, of course.

160
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:20,554
Didn't she try
and break your fingers?

161
00:20:45,162 --> 00:20:45,996
Hi.

162
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,165
Hi. I'll be right with you.

163
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:49,249
Thanks.

164
00:21:26,787 --> 00:21:27,788
You know…

165
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:32,376
it's the next step for a lot of people.

166
00:21:36,755 --> 00:21:37,756
I love you.

167
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:40,217
I love you too.

168
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,679
I'm sorry.

169
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:28,390
You ready?

170
00:22:28,473 --> 00:22:30,058
- Huh?
- It's time.

171
00:22:37,107 --> 00:22:38,609
Locked and loaded.

172
00:22:38,692 --> 00:22:40,110
Third time's the charm.

173
00:22:40,194 --> 00:22:41,486
That's what they say.

174
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:43,030
I'll write you a thank-you note.

175
00:22:43,906 --> 00:22:45,657
You hate writing thank-you notes.

176
00:22:45,741 --> 00:22:48,785
Oh, my God.
I'm a little nervous.

177
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:51,872
- Baby?
- Mmm?

178
00:22:51,955 --> 00:22:53,057
I said I'm a little nervous.

179
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:55,459
Oh, yeah. Well, you know,

180
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:58,795
it's the final step and, you know,

181
00:22:58,879 --> 00:23:02,841
there's a kid that's out there
just waiting for us.

182
00:23:03,509 --> 00:23:05,719
Just got to reach out and grab her. Right?

183
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:08,555
What if it doesn't work?

184
00:23:08,639 --> 00:23:10,599
Turn around and bend over.

185
00:23:13,852 --> 00:23:16,647
- Ow.
- Sorry. You okay?

186
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:44,258
How are you feeling?

187
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:47,719
My mouth hurts.

188
00:23:48,804 --> 00:23:50,931
Which room
caused your mouth to hurt?

189
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,225
The first one.

190
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,561
Wellington.

191
00:24:03,777 --> 00:24:05,946
How many rooms did you visit today?

192
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:09,616
Six.

193
00:24:10,158 --> 00:24:12,828
The Billings room, the Lucknow room,

194
00:24:12,911 --> 00:24:18,125
St. Pierre, Cairns, Zurich, and…

195
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:19,793
The Wellington room.

196
00:24:19,877 --> 00:24:21,712
The Wellington. Excellent.

197
00:24:23,172 --> 00:24:27,092
And what happened in the rooms?
You remember nothing?

198
00:24:29,261 --> 00:24:30,262
Nothing.

199
00:24:38,562 --> 00:24:40,189
How did you feel in the hall?

200
00:24:41,231 --> 00:24:45,444
Did you exit any of the rooms
feeling despair?

201
00:24:46,612 --> 00:24:49,198
Fervor? Gaiety?

202
00:24:51,783 --> 00:24:53,744
There's only one room
I haven't been to yet,

203
00:24:53,827 --> 00:24:55,329
and today it had a name on it.

204
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:00,334
Cold Harbor.

205
00:25:02,127 --> 00:25:06,882
So, what happens,
once I've been in all the rooms?

206
00:25:12,387 --> 00:25:16,725
You will see the world again,
and the world will see you.

207
00:25:20,604 --> 00:25:23,941
So, I'll see Mark?

208
00:25:25,776 --> 00:25:28,529
Mark will benefit
from the world you're siring.

209
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:33,200
Kier will take away all his pain,
just as Kier has taken away yours.

210
00:25:38,914 --> 00:25:43,001
Can you please just talk
like a normal person?

211
00:25:48,006 --> 00:25:51,718
Good night, Gemma. Dream sweet.

212
00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:16,034
Gemma, coffee's ready!

213
00:26:35,137 --> 00:26:36,138
Is he okay?

214
00:26:36,221 --> 00:26:37,306
He's stable.

215
00:26:37,389 --> 00:26:38,932
It was an isolated event.

216
00:26:39,516 --> 00:26:40,976
He's journeying now.

217
00:26:42,394 --> 00:26:43,854
When will he wake up?

218
00:26:43,937 --> 00:26:45,147
When he's ready to.

219
00:26:45,856 --> 00:26:46,982
Great.

220
00:26:49,818 --> 00:26:51,258
You really think this is gonna work?

221
00:26:52,321 --> 00:26:53,572
There's no other choice.

222
00:27:00,078 --> 00:27:01,830
There's an innie cabin.

223
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:03,582
Come again?

224
00:27:04,166 --> 00:27:05,435
There… I mean, it's technically…

225
00:27:05,459 --> 00:27:08,253
It's a cottage where severed people
become their innies,

226
00:27:08,337 --> 00:27:09,546
and there was this woman--

227
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:10,881
Damona Birthing Retreat.

228
00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:15,469
Well, so maybe if we go to the cabin,
we could talk to his innie, and he could--

229
00:27:15,552 --> 00:27:17,721
They're two completely different things.

230
00:27:18,263 --> 00:27:20,349
This is how you get Gemma out.

231
00:27:20,432 --> 00:27:22,893
Really, this? Because this looks like
how you kill my brother.

232
00:27:24,978 --> 00:27:26,647
You two are definitely related.

233
00:27:35,405 --> 00:27:36,990
- I could call her.
- Who?

234
00:27:37,074 --> 00:27:39,493
- Harmony Cobel.
- What? Why would you do that?

235
00:27:39,576 --> 00:27:41,036
She runs the severed floor.

236
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:43,997
Not anymore, she doesn't.
She might know how to get in the cabin.

237
00:27:44,081 --> 00:27:46,208
And, fuck, she might know
how to get to Gemma.

238
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:48,043
She's Lumon through and through.

239
00:27:48,126 --> 00:27:50,671
She was raised by them. She's a soldier.

240
00:27:50,754 --> 00:27:52,631
- It's a risk. I get that.
- A risk?

241
00:27:52,714 --> 00:27:55,008
- Yeah.
- She will turn you over to them.

242
00:27:55,092 --> 00:27:56,301
Both of us.

243
00:27:56,385 --> 00:27:58,512
Everything I've done to fight, gone.

244
00:27:58,595 --> 00:28:00,931
We resume the treatment
as soon as he wakes up.

245
00:28:01,014 --> 00:28:04,518
Okay. I have custody
of his brain now. You don't.

246
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:05,769
I'm calling her.

247
00:28:18,156 --> 00:28:20,742
- Well, then, I can't be a part of this.
- What?

248
00:28:20,826 --> 00:28:23,495
If you do that…
If you make that choice…

249
00:28:24,204 --> 00:28:25,682
What are you…
No, seriously, what are you doing?

250
00:28:25,706 --> 00:28:28,292
- Good luck.
- You can't leave him like this.

251
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:30,669
No, no, no, I can't do this without you.

252
00:28:32,129 --> 00:28:33,922
You… Are you kidding?

253
00:28:34,715 --> 00:28:36,091
You're leaving now?

254
00:28:36,675 --> 00:28:39,970
This… This isn't my choice. It's yours.

255
00:28:40,053 --> 00:28:41,847
No, I need you to stay. I can't…

256
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:44,683
I don't know what to do with this.
What do I do if he wakes up?

257
00:28:44,766 --> 00:28:46,351
Do not call that woman.

258
00:28:46,894 --> 00:28:47,895
Oh, my God.

259
00:28:59,907 --> 00:29:00,908
Hey.

260
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,035
Chi…

261
00:29:03,869 --> 00:29:07,289
- Mark?
- Chikha… Chikha…

262
00:29:07,372 --> 00:29:09,583
- What are you trying to say?
- Chikhai…

263
00:29:11,543 --> 00:29:12,961
Chik…

264
00:29:13,045 --> 00:29:14,379
Chikhai bardo?

265
00:29:14,963 --> 00:29:17,174
I don't know.
It looks like two guys fighting.

266
00:29:18,175 --> 00:29:23,639
No, it's the same guy fighting himself,
defeating his own psyche. Ego death.

267
00:29:24,348 --> 00:29:26,225
How do you know it's the same guy?

268
00:29:26,308 --> 00:29:28,185
Well, the hair's the same.

269
00:29:28,268 --> 00:29:29,311
Oh.

270
00:29:30,187 --> 00:29:31,522
That thing came in the mail?

271
00:29:32,773 --> 00:29:35,484
Yeah. It's one of those things
where you have to draw a duck

272
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:37,110
or a rabbit or whatever.

273
00:29:37,819 --> 00:29:40,697
I think I got onto the mailing list
at the clinic.

274
00:29:42,115 --> 00:29:43,742
Why are you wasting your time with this?

275
00:29:47,162 --> 00:29:49,122
Why are you being an asshole?

276
00:29:49,206 --> 00:29:51,542
I'm not. I'm just… I don't know.
It seems kind of…

277
00:29:53,669 --> 00:29:55,921
- weird.
- I'm enjoying this.

278
00:29:56,505 --> 00:29:59,424
Or was, until you ruined it.

279
00:29:59,508 --> 00:30:01,628
I think you might be
overreacting a little bit, Gemma.

280
00:30:02,344 --> 00:30:03,470
Don't do that.

281
00:30:04,096 --> 00:30:05,097
Do what?

282
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:09,768
- Tell me how I'm feeling.
- I have no idea how you're feeling.

283
00:30:09,852 --> 00:30:12,229
Like shit. Beat to shit.

284
00:30:12,312 --> 00:30:14,231
So let's stop.

285
00:31:28,889 --> 00:31:31,850
It's okay. This is perfectly normal.

286
00:31:31,934 --> 00:31:35,229
Let's get you set up with that meal.
Bon appétit.

287
00:31:35,854 --> 00:31:38,524
Can I get you anything else? Coffee? Tea?

288
00:31:38,607 --> 00:31:40,817
Another pillow…

289
00:31:47,115 --> 00:31:49,201
He's stuck at 96%.

290
00:31:50,827 --> 00:31:52,871
The nose bleeds set us back.

291
00:31:54,831 --> 00:31:57,709
When he's done,
you're gonna have to say goodbye to her.

292
00:32:00,379 --> 00:32:01,588
I'm aware.

293
00:32:05,634 --> 00:32:06,677
For Kier.

294
00:32:12,349 --> 00:32:13,433
For Kier.

295
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:21,900
Why are you wearing that stupid sweater?

296
00:32:53,432 --> 00:32:56,393
Dear Mr. Tisdale,

297
00:32:57,644 --> 00:33:00,606
I cannot thank you enough…

298
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:05,694
for the thoughtful Christmas gift

299
00:33:06,403 --> 00:33:09,907
you sent my husband and I this year.

300
00:33:17,247 --> 00:33:20,834
We have never owned…

301
00:33:21,418 --> 00:33:24,796
…an electric grouter.

302
00:33:27,174 --> 00:33:30,302
And we look forward…

303
00:33:30,385 --> 00:33:31,887
…to…

304
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:36,642
…the many happy

305
00:33:37,601 --> 00:33:39,728
memories…

306
00:33:41,021 --> 00:33:43,398
…it will

307
00:33:44,316 --> 00:33:45,317
provide.

308
00:33:49,821 --> 00:33:53,492
Come on now, sweetheart.
It's the last one.

309
00:34:03,001 --> 00:34:04,461
Nothing…

310
00:34:05,254 --> 00:34:06,463
says…

311
00:34:07,422 --> 00:34:10,759
Christmas like…

312
00:34:13,428 --> 00:34:14,554
grouting.

313
00:34:16,681 --> 00:34:19,351
I-It's actually a-a de-grouter,

314
00:34:20,936 --> 00:34:22,478
but close enough.

315
00:34:26,315 --> 00:34:28,569
How much longer do I have to do this?

316
00:34:29,319 --> 00:34:31,655
I told you, you're done.

317
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:37,077
But Christmas has a funny way
of coming back around each year.

318
00:34:44,293 --> 00:34:46,170
It's always Christmas.

319
00:34:50,674 --> 00:34:51,884
Let's go.

320
00:35:03,896 --> 00:35:04,897
I love you.

321
00:35:07,566 --> 00:35:08,567
Ooh.

322
00:35:10,194 --> 00:35:12,613
I said, "I love you."

323
00:35:18,702 --> 00:35:20,120
I love you too.

324
00:37:34,546 --> 00:37:35,547
Hello, Gemma.

325
00:37:36,507 --> 00:37:37,633
Dr. Mauer.

326
00:37:38,675 --> 00:37:39,843
How are you feeling?

327
00:37:42,221 --> 00:37:43,388
My hand hurts.

328
00:37:45,516 --> 00:37:48,060
And what room caused your hand to hurt?

329
00:37:52,814 --> 00:37:54,149
Allentown.

330
00:37:54,733 --> 00:37:55,734
Hmm.

331
00:38:04,785 --> 00:38:05,994
I want to go home.

332
00:38:17,714 --> 00:38:19,550
Your husband remarried last year…

333
00:38:23,387 --> 00:38:25,264
and he has a daughter now.

334
00:38:30,227 --> 00:38:32,563
I don't believe you.

335
00:38:32,646 --> 00:38:34,815
You've been gone a long time, Gemma.

336
00:38:35,858 --> 00:38:37,192
He's moved on.

337
00:38:38,902 --> 00:38:40,487
Maybe you've moved on too.

338
00:38:42,281 --> 00:38:44,157
In one of the rooms. What do you think?

339
00:38:50,455 --> 00:38:54,084
Do you feel yourself gravitating
towards one room or another?

340
00:38:55,294 --> 00:38:58,797
Maybe you felt things behind those doors
you never felt with Mark.

341
00:39:01,049 --> 00:39:02,467
Maybe I've seen it.

342
00:39:06,471 --> 00:39:07,514
Hmm.

343
00:39:08,223 --> 00:39:10,559
The Death of Ivan Ilyich.

344
00:39:10,642 --> 00:39:14,563
Let me guess. He dies at the end.

345
00:40:53,871 --> 00:40:54,913
Gemma!

346
00:41:01,879 --> 00:41:03,630
Gemma! Stop!

347
00:41:03,714 --> 00:41:05,007
Gemma!

348
00:41:22,566 --> 00:41:23,567
Hey.

349
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:25,277
You sure you don't want to come?

350
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,237
Uh… It's charades.

351
00:41:27,321 --> 00:41:29,031
That's gonna be, like, 20 minutes of it.

352
00:41:29,114 --> 00:41:30,699
Yeah. But, you know.

353
00:41:32,451 --> 00:41:33,952
Or I could stay?

354
00:41:34,036 --> 00:41:36,246
No, you should probably go.

355
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:38,665
I mean, this thing's
gotta be in tonight anyway, so…

356
00:41:40,042 --> 00:41:44,046
Okay. Did you get the, uh,
Denali thing I sent?

357
00:41:44,129 --> 00:41:45,714
The… Uh, no.

358
00:41:45,797 --> 00:41:49,176
Uh, I'll-I'll look at it.
I'll-I'll check it out.

359
00:41:49,259 --> 00:41:52,346
All right. Well, I'll be back
at, like, 10:00.

360
00:41:52,971 --> 00:41:54,223
Okay.

361
00:41:54,306 --> 00:41:55,349
I love you.

362
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,813
- I said--
- Oh, no, I love you too, hon. I'm sorry.

363
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:05,734
- Bye.
- See you.

364
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:47,442
Ms. Casey.

365
00:42:50,654 --> 00:42:51,905
Mr. Milchick.

366
00:42:52,531 --> 00:42:53,699
I'm so sorry.

367
00:42:56,118 --> 00:42:57,452
What's happening?

368
00:42:57,536 --> 00:42:58,537
Nothing.

369
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:01,874
Your outie came in
for a public art exhibition

370
00:43:01,957 --> 00:43:05,294
and found herself
in the wrong elevator.

371
00:43:07,296 --> 00:43:08,297
Oh.

372
00:43:10,841 --> 00:43:12,009
How long have I been--

373
00:43:12,092 --> 00:43:15,053
If you wouldn't mind turning around
and heading back in,

374
00:43:15,137 --> 00:43:16,680
it would be greatly appreciated.

375
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:19,683
- But--
- On you go.

376
00:43:36,617 --> 00:43:38,660
- Where's--
- Thank you, Ms. Casey.

377
00:45:06,874 --> 00:45:08,542
No.

378
00:46:25,994 --> 00:46:28,664
Mark.

379
00:46:33,585 --> 00:46:35,963
- Come on.
- Mark.

380
00:47:27,514 --> 00:47:28,515
Mark?

381
00:47:30,434 --> 00:47:32,769
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

382
00:47:34,938 --> 00:47:35,939
Hi.

383
00:47:41,111 --> 00:47:42,779
Hey.

384
00:47:50,537 --> 00:47:52,039
Careful. Easy.

385
00:47:59,087 --> 00:48:00,464
Oh, Mark.

386
00:48:02,716 --> 00:48:03,926
Where'd you go?
