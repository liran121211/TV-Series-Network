1
00:00:51,136 --> 00:00:52,137
Graner.

2
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:54,639
We ran the data
from Kilmer's head like you asked.

3
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:57,362
We found the signature from the console
they used to hack the chip.

4
00:00:57,392 --> 00:00:59,310
Whose was it?

5
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:00,561
Ours.

6
00:01:00,645 --> 00:01:02,271
I think it's traceable to Reghabi.

7
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:04,814
- Reghabi.
- Yep.

8
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,319
She cracked reintegration. I'll find her.

9
00:01:32,051 --> 00:01:35,388
"Tame in me the tempers four"

10
00:01:37,057 --> 00:01:39,391
that I may serve thee evermore.

11
00:01:41,269 --> 00:01:44,063
Place in me the values nine

12
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:48,359
"that I may feel thy touch divine."

13
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:56,213
Can I come in?

14
00:04:56,298 --> 00:04:58,007
Yeah. Yeah.

15
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,560
You found this?

16
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:12,021
A while back.

17
00:05:13,398 --> 00:05:16,776
I come here sometimes, just me.

18
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:24,492
Now, I want to show it to you.

19
00:05:25,869 --> 00:05:27,161
It's beautiful.

20
00:05:29,247 --> 00:05:33,043
It could be just for us. Our secret place.

21
00:05:35,211 --> 00:05:36,379
Finally.

22
00:05:37,672 --> 00:05:41,634
What I mean to say is that
your O&D colleagues are very nice,

23
00:05:41,718 --> 00:05:43,261
but they're also…

24
00:05:43,345 --> 00:05:45,221
- Always around.
- Yes.

25
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:55,231
Is this okay?

26
00:05:58,526 --> 00:06:04,615
Irving, you know, the Lumon manual doesn't
say anything about lip-to-lip contact.

27
00:06:05,658 --> 00:06:10,329
It does discourage
romantic fraternization, though.

28
00:06:10,413 --> 00:06:12,249
This can't be romantic then.

29
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:15,418
No.

30
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:21,257
Not romantic… at all?

31
00:06:25,762 --> 00:06:27,055
I'm truly sorry…

32
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:31,141
I'm just not ready.

33
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,521
I'm... I'm sorry.

34
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:42,194
It's fine.

35
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:46,615
Just stay.

36
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:52,122
Stay here with me.

37
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,353
You did so good.

38
00:07:15,437 --> 00:07:19,481
Now we're gonna go home
and see if you'll eat. Please.

39
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,552
Looks like we both made it through.

40
00:07:47,636 --> 00:07:49,553
- Oh, hello.
- Hi.

41
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:52,307
Devon. From the retreat.

42
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:54,600
I accosted you for your coffee.

43
00:07:56,937 --> 00:07:58,687
He's beautiful.

44
00:07:58,771 --> 00:08:00,064
He looks like a William.

45
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,942
His name's Bradley, actually.

46
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,110
Not William?

47
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:09,490
- You changed it?
- Did we leave the juice boxes in the car?

48
00:08:10,367 --> 00:08:11,492
We must have, yeah.

49
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:15,247
Hi. Angelo Arteta.

50
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:17,040
I'm Devon. Nice to meet you.

51
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,500
- Congratulations there.
- Oh, thank you.

52
00:08:19,584 --> 00:08:21,293
You two know each other?

53
00:08:21,377 --> 00:08:24,129
Yeah, I was... We were...
Met at the birthing cottages.

54
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:29,177
- Nice to meet you too, Devon.
- Yeah. You too.

55
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:33,389
Wow-kazow.

56
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:36,684
We should go.

57
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,272
- Bye. Bye.
- Bye, you guys.

58
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:42,355
Bye, Bradley.

59
00:08:45,277 --> 00:08:47,403
Declan, Kai, come on.

60
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:50,740
What in the fuckity fuck?

61
00:08:51,991 --> 00:08:52,993
Sorry.

62
00:08:55,245 --> 00:08:57,330
What does camaraderie mean?

63
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:02,501
Most linguists agree
it comes from the Latin "camera,"

64
00:09:03,128 --> 00:09:06,255
which means
"a device used to take a photograph."

65
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:12,261
And of course, the best photographs
are of groups of happy friends

66
00:09:12,345 --> 00:09:13,889
who love each other deeply.

67
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:19,311
But I think camaraderie is more
than smiling together in photos.

68
00:09:19,894 --> 00:09:22,563
It's standing together in hard times.

69
00:09:23,315 --> 00:09:27,067
It's recognizing a common struggle
in another person

70
00:09:27,903 --> 00:09:31,990
and reaching out
to offer them a loving hand.

71
00:09:36,786 --> 00:09:40,248
We should return to O&D immediately.

72
00:09:40,331 --> 00:09:41,832
All of us. Today.

73
00:09:41,917 --> 00:09:43,335
Someone's eager to fraternize.

74
00:09:43,418 --> 00:09:45,169
Fraternization has nothing to do with it.

75
00:09:45,253 --> 00:09:48,631
This could be the start
of us uniting the departments

76
00:09:48,715 --> 00:09:50,799
the way Kier always intended.

77
00:09:50,884 --> 00:09:52,677
Maybe his ghost can
officiate your wedding.

78
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,846
This is inappropriate workplace
commentary. And I'm self-reporting you.

79
00:09:55,931 --> 00:09:58,099
You're reporting me to yourself?

80
00:09:58,182 --> 00:10:00,059
Okay. You said they were making things?

81
00:10:00,143 --> 00:10:02,312
Yes, in some kind of machines.
We didn't ask what.

82
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:04,115
It's the clubs
they murder those goats with.

83
00:10:04,188 --> 00:10:05,190
Shut up.

84
00:10:05,774 --> 00:10:07,984
I agree with Irving.
O&D is the next piece of this.

85
00:10:08,067 --> 00:10:11,863
- Now, once we've mapped the whole floor...
- To be clear, I do not approve of mapping.

86
00:10:12,655 --> 00:10:13,740
Right.

87
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:16,326
What if we go on
another "mental health walk"?

88
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:17,409
Could be fun.

89
00:10:19,913 --> 00:10:21,081
What... I don't know.

90
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:24,583
I mean, we still
have a lot of work to do, so…

91
00:10:24,668 --> 00:10:25,876
Oh, right.

92
00:10:27,254 --> 00:10:29,880
The work is mysterious and important.

93
00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:35,095
That's good.
That sounds just like me.

94
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:36,221
I know.

95
00:10:38,557 --> 00:10:40,225
Back to work, slackers.

96
00:10:44,437 --> 00:10:45,437
Praise Kier.

97
00:10:47,065 --> 00:10:48,066
Hey.

98
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,277
Are you fraternizing too?

99
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,028
What? No, I...

100
00:10:53,113 --> 00:10:56,950
I'm a leader who cares about his employees

101
00:10:57,033 --> 00:10:58,909
and takes their requests seriously.

102
00:10:58,994 --> 00:11:00,120
- Really?
- Yeah.

103
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:02,746
Look at you all dewy mouthed.

104
00:11:02,831 --> 00:11:04,874
- You never smile at me.
- He's right, Mark.

105
00:11:04,957 --> 00:11:08,086
You are sparing
with the facial encouragements.

106
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,297
That's ridiculous. I smile all the time.

107
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:11,548
Hey there.

108
00:11:12,298 --> 00:11:14,091
What are you all talking about?

109
00:11:15,802 --> 00:11:16,845
Just...

110
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:17,928
- We're...
- Dis...

111
00:11:18,013 --> 00:11:20,347
- Discussing the...
- Yes, Mrs...

112
00:11:20,432 --> 00:11:23,726
- Ms. Casey. Ms. Casey.
- Ms. Casey. Yeah.

113
00:11:24,894 --> 00:11:25,937
Wait, where is she?

114
00:11:28,523 --> 00:11:34,195
Part-time innies may not be as
socialized and sophisticated as yourself,

115
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:37,698
but they still must be held accountable
for their actions.

116
00:11:38,283 --> 00:11:43,413
Ms. Casey was told to supervise Helly,
and she failed at that task.

117
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:46,332
Because I snuck Helly out.

118
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:48,751
I mean, if anyone should be
in the break room, it's me.

119
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:52,963
Valiance.

120
00:11:53,715 --> 00:11:56,426
Not a core principle, but sweet.

121
00:11:57,469 --> 00:11:59,929
Who won't you go to the break room for?

122
00:12:02,349 --> 00:12:05,476
She's just a wellness counselor, Mark.

123
00:12:06,019 --> 00:12:07,812
Yes, but she shouldn't be punished.

124
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:09,563
I mean, I thought Helly needed a walk.

125
00:12:09,648 --> 00:12:11,274
I mean, I'm allowed to do that.

126
00:12:11,357 --> 00:12:12,942
Just a walk?

127
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:14,568
Yeah.

128
00:12:20,283 --> 00:12:22,494
Or were you sniffing around
other departments

129
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:25,996
while your department falls
woefully below quota?

130
00:12:26,831 --> 00:12:28,541
She almost died.

131
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:32,336
It's not your job
to play nursemaid to every new refiner.

132
00:12:33,922 --> 00:12:36,216
Okay, so what is my job?

133
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:37,884
Are you really asking me that?

134
00:12:39,302 --> 00:12:40,302
Yeah.

135
00:12:40,803 --> 00:12:42,972
What is it we actually do here?

136
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:48,311
We serve Kier, you child!

137
00:12:48,812 --> 00:12:54,734
And until you get that through
your mildewed little brain and hit quota,

138
00:12:55,317 --> 00:12:59,280
MDR's hallway privileges
are hereby revoked.

139
00:13:00,115 --> 00:13:05,245
So get your little ass back to your desk
and stay there until you're told to move.

140
00:13:12,126 --> 00:13:14,421
Goddamn tragedy for the ages.

141
00:13:14,504 --> 00:13:17,966
MDR will mourn the "will-they-won't-they"
energy shared by Ms. Casey and myself.

142
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:19,049
Oh, yeah?

143
00:13:19,134 --> 00:13:21,302
And to think
I wore this nice-ass shirt for her today.

144
00:13:23,471 --> 00:13:25,682
When you picked that shirt,
you didn't know she existed.

145
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:28,100
Well, maybe love transcends severance.

146
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:30,269
- You think so?
- No.

147
00:13:32,898 --> 00:13:34,149
What about you and Mark?

148
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:35,482
What?

149
00:13:35,567 --> 00:13:38,068
You two enjoy
sneaking off the other day?

150
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,196
"Baby goats"?

151
00:13:41,447 --> 00:13:43,283
Why are you saying it like that?

152
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:49,163
Are you implying that "baby goats" is
code for sex with Mark S.?

153
00:13:51,165 --> 00:13:52,709
Wow.

154
00:13:53,293 --> 00:13:56,379
Is "baby goats"
code for sex with Mark S.?

155
00:13:56,962 --> 00:13:58,380
No, they were actual goats.

156
00:13:58,465 --> 00:13:59,966
Why would we call it that?

157
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:02,760
Okay. Yeah, I believe you.

158
00:14:02,844 --> 00:14:03,970
Mark.

159
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:07,014
You find out what happened?

160
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:09,142
She's in the break room.

161
00:14:09,225 --> 00:14:11,811
Shit. Is that because of us?

162
00:14:14,272 --> 00:14:17,399
And we're not allowed in the
outer hallways anymore till we hit quota,

163
00:14:17,484 --> 00:14:21,153
so no more interdepartmental visits!

164
00:14:23,865 --> 00:14:25,366
Are you serious?

165
00:14:30,705 --> 00:14:31,706
I'm…

166
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:35,751
I'm sorry, Mark. It's... It's my fault…

167
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:43,176
that I've been setting a bad example
as the senior-most refiner.

168
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:51,017
Which way did you say it was to O&D?

169
00:15:13,748 --> 00:15:15,375
Milchick!

170
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:16,543
I'm on it.

171
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:51,912
This is more people than I've ever seen.

172
00:15:52,578 --> 00:15:53,996
Same.

173
00:15:56,917 --> 00:15:58,375
It's okay.

174
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:02,339
I know change can be disorienting,

175
00:16:02,923 --> 00:16:04,673
but MDR is here now.

176
00:16:07,719 --> 00:16:09,011
You are welcome here,

177
00:16:09,095 --> 00:16:14,725
much as I hope all of us will be welcome
to visit you at your place of endeavors.

178
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:18,647
Now go on. Surely you must have
some questions for them.

179
00:16:24,235 --> 00:16:27,197
So, it's called Macrodata Refinement?

180
00:16:29,573 --> 00:16:31,201
What do you refine?

181
00:16:36,248 --> 00:16:37,414
Is that a watering can?

182
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:45,215
We think it might be supplies
for the executive wing upstairs.

183
00:16:45,298 --> 00:16:49,677
Then again, last week's output had
more of an aggressive feel.

184
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,136
The hatchets weren't aggressive.

185
00:16:51,221 --> 00:16:53,181
Hatchets?

186
00:16:54,599 --> 00:16:57,309
We've been trying to figure out
how it all fits together.

187
00:16:57,394 --> 00:17:01,313
We found a department
the opposite way from here

188
00:17:01,398 --> 00:17:05,192
that's, well, raising baby goats.

189
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:07,778
Raising baby goats?

190
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:17,497
There is a lot unknown to us as well,
but we keep plugging along.

191
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,248
It's important work, obviously.

192
00:17:19,332 --> 00:17:21,959
Everything we do here is important.

193
00:17:24,253 --> 00:17:27,464
It's important because it actually is
or because you're saying it is?

194
00:17:30,093 --> 00:17:33,680
Look, maybe we should
work together on this.

195
00:17:35,557 --> 00:17:39,184
Together doing what, exactly?

196
00:17:39,269 --> 00:17:42,355
I don't know.
Finding out why there are goats.

197
00:17:42,439 --> 00:17:47,234
Or, you know, finding out
how big this place is

198
00:17:47,318 --> 00:17:48,987
or how many of us there are.

199
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,787
I mean, why won't they tell us
what we're doing here?

200
00:17:58,747 --> 00:18:00,457
What-What are they so afraid of?

201
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:06,587
If the Eagan philosophy is
illumination above all...

202
00:18:06,671 --> 00:18:08,548
Illumination beyond all.

203
00:18:08,632 --> 00:18:09,673
But yes.

204
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:12,885
Then why doesn't that include us?

205
00:18:13,595 --> 00:18:18,557
Why are we down here
still working in the dark?

206
00:18:25,565 --> 00:18:27,358
That was poetic as shit, man.

207
00:18:27,442 --> 00:18:28,526
Thanks.

208
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,197
Mark is right.

209
00:18:32,822 --> 00:18:34,365
- He is?
- He is.

210
00:18:34,449 --> 00:18:40,454
Irving, Kier would want us to feel
the warm embrace of knowledge and truth.

211
00:18:40,538 --> 00:18:43,458
That way we could be true partners
in his teachings.

212
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,042
Exactly.

213
00:18:46,502 --> 00:18:50,798
I think, as the two department chiefs,

214
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:55,761
Mark and I should make contact with this
goat department, see what they know.

215
00:18:57,513 --> 00:19:01,977
And we can each bring one aide-de-camp.

216
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:27,251
We're not children, Mr. Milchick.
We didn't do anything wrong.

217
00:19:50,692 --> 00:19:55,572
Kier, chosen one, Kier

218
00:19:56,072 --> 00:20:01,368
Kier, brilliant one, Kier

219
00:20:01,452 --> 00:20:07,834
Brings the bounty to the plain
Through the torment, through the rains

220
00:20:08,417 --> 00:20:13,131
Progress, knowledge Show no fear

221
00:20:13,923 --> 00:20:18,678
Kier, chosen one

222
00:20:18,761 --> 00:20:21,056
Kier

223
00:20:27,061 --> 00:20:31,566
I trusted you, and you abused that trust.

224
00:20:32,776 --> 00:20:36,028
Your inefficiency
and free-range chicken roaming

225
00:20:36,112 --> 00:20:38,906
is ultimately your responsibility.

226
00:20:47,374 --> 00:20:50,125
Escort him to the break room.

227
00:22:02,406 --> 00:22:03,407
I'm sorry.

228
00:22:22,426 --> 00:22:23,845
What happened to your hand?

229
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:30,227
Apparently, I jammed my hand at work
replenishing a watercooler.

230
00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:32,019
Or at least that's what they tell me.

231
00:22:32,103 --> 00:22:33,646
Those jugs are very heavy.

232
00:22:34,271 --> 00:22:35,440
Indeed they are.

233
00:22:35,522 --> 00:22:36,732
Another merlot?

234
00:22:36,816 --> 00:22:37,817
I'm fine, thanks.

235
00:22:38,484 --> 00:22:40,111
I'm good with water, thank you.

236
00:22:42,697 --> 00:22:44,782
Have you seen the princess?

237
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:47,701
No, not since her birth.

238
00:22:47,786 --> 00:22:49,913
But I did talk on the phone
with your sister.

239
00:22:50,413 --> 00:22:52,266
I don't know
how much she tells you about her...

240
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:54,000
- Latching difficulties?
- Yes.

241
00:22:54,084 --> 00:22:56,795
I-I'm aware.
Maybe too aware. I don't know.

242
00:22:56,877 --> 00:23:00,339
Well, she just wanted
the names of some lactation consultants.

243
00:23:01,423 --> 00:23:03,343
Well, it's not something serious, is it?

244
00:23:03,425 --> 00:23:04,885
No. It's very common.

245
00:23:05,511 --> 00:23:07,763
Still, it's probably good
to get an expert opinion.

246
00:23:07,846 --> 00:23:09,266
I mean, from someone other than…

247
00:23:09,348 --> 00:23:11,809
- Ricken? Yes.
- …Ricken.

248
00:23:13,894 --> 00:23:15,980
Did you ever think about having kids?

249
00:23:18,066 --> 00:23:19,067
With Gemma?

250
00:23:20,527 --> 00:23:21,528
Yes.

251
00:23:27,075 --> 00:23:28,742
Yeah, we tried for a little while.

252
00:23:29,618 --> 00:23:30,953
It wasn't really working.

253
00:23:32,413 --> 00:23:34,665
We talked about adopting at one point,
but…

254
00:23:37,085 --> 00:23:41,548
I don't know. Then you think,
"Okay, this is the life you've been given."

255
00:23:42,173 --> 00:23:46,260
And, um, that's another life,
and you don't get that one.

256
00:23:46,344 --> 00:23:48,387
"So do something with this."

257
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,057
That's very healthy.

258
00:23:52,142 --> 00:23:54,769
Well, it's mostly stuff she said.

259
00:23:56,313 --> 00:23:59,691
She was very pragmatic.

260
00:24:00,357 --> 00:24:01,942
Always had a plan B.

261
00:24:02,027 --> 00:24:05,529
You know, one time we were supposed to go
on this camping trip and...

262
00:24:05,614 --> 00:24:08,032
Is it weird
that I'm talking about her right now?

263
00:24:08,115 --> 00:24:10,993
- I feel like...
- No, I think it's also healthy.

264
00:24:11,786 --> 00:24:13,329
Yeah, but we're on a date. I...

265
00:24:14,914 --> 00:24:16,583
I haven't walked out on you yet.

266
00:24:23,464 --> 00:24:28,636
You know, sometimes I think…
she'd want me to get off my ass.

267
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:32,032
And sometimes I think
she's not worried about me at all.

268
00:24:32,057 --> 00:24:34,517
She's just pissed that she's dead.

269
00:24:37,895 --> 00:24:39,940
Sorry, I know this doesn't
totally make sense.

270
00:24:41,732 --> 00:24:43,067
She's a part of you.

271
00:24:44,109 --> 00:24:46,278
You know?
You can't just separate yourself...

272
00:24:46,363 --> 00:24:50,325
- Oh, no, but you can, Alexa.
- Oh, shit.

273
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:52,535
With this exciting new procedure.

274
00:24:52,618 --> 00:24:54,996
- Walked right into that.
- Yes, you did.

275
00:25:40,165 --> 00:25:41,375
- Love?
- Yeah?

276
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,628
- She's here.
- Yeah.

277
00:25:49,675 --> 00:25:52,846
Careful. Watch your step.
Right this way.

278
00:25:52,929 --> 00:25:56,348
- Love it.
- Okay. My girl. There's my girl.

279
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,854
Okay.

280
00:26:02,771 --> 00:26:04,441
You must be Devon.

281
00:26:04,523 --> 00:26:06,026
Devon, this is Mrs. Selvig.

282
00:26:06,108 --> 00:26:09,278
Hi. Yeah, and you're Mark's neighbor.
Thanks so much for meeting with us.

283
00:26:09,362 --> 00:26:11,030
Oh, it's a privilege.

284
00:26:11,114 --> 00:26:13,782
I went giddy when Mark mentioned
you were looking for someone.

285
00:26:13,866 --> 00:26:16,744
- So serendipitous.
- I know.

286
00:26:16,827 --> 00:26:18,288
The kelp worked, huh?

287
00:26:18,954 --> 00:26:21,583
And this must be little Eleanor.

288
00:26:21,665 --> 00:26:23,585
Hello, little Eleanor.

289
00:26:26,337 --> 00:26:28,632
- You had a vaginal birth, yes?
- Oh, yeah.

290
00:26:28,714 --> 00:26:30,674
We should talk about
different nursing positions.

291
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:32,301
Oh, and I brought you this.

292
00:26:33,385 --> 00:26:36,013
Shea butter salve for your nipples.

293
00:26:36,096 --> 00:26:37,097
It's on the house.

294
00:26:37,598 --> 00:26:39,558
- We are talking to a few candidates.
- Of course.

295
00:26:39,643 --> 00:26:41,310
Oh, here we go.

296
00:26:41,394 --> 00:26:42,979
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Yeah.

297
00:26:43,063 --> 00:26:47,483
Oh, no, don't be sorry.
That's what babies do.

298
00:26:47,567 --> 00:26:48,902
May I?

299
00:26:48,984 --> 00:26:49,986
Yeah, yeah.

300
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:54,199
Darling.

301
00:26:54,281 --> 00:26:56,992
There, there, there. Okay.

302
00:27:25,188 --> 00:27:27,231
…seventy hundred one,

303
00:27:27,898 --> 00:27:30,026
seventy hundred two,

304
00:27:30,652 --> 00:27:32,988
seventy hundred forty-three,

305
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:36,782
seventy hundred forty-six,

306
00:27:36,865 --> 00:27:40,327
seventy hundred forty-eight…

307
00:27:42,122 --> 00:27:43,163
Dylan.

308
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:47,836
I've awoken you at home.
I need to know where you put it.

309
00:27:48,878 --> 00:27:50,005
Where I put what?

310
00:27:50,087 --> 00:27:51,839
The ideographic card you took from O&D.

311
00:27:51,923 --> 00:27:53,674
I saw the footage of you taking it.

312
00:27:53,758 --> 00:27:55,885
Did you smuggle it out? Is it here?

313
00:27:55,969 --> 00:27:57,511
Holy shit, is this my house?

314
00:27:57,596 --> 00:28:00,932
Dylan, listen. You have no idea
how sensitive this information is.

315
00:28:02,017 --> 00:28:04,352
If someone paid you
to smuggle out that card...

316
00:28:04,435 --> 00:28:06,479
No, no. I just...
I put it in the bathroom.

317
00:28:06,563 --> 00:28:08,189
Second stall, behind the toilet.

318
00:28:08,272 --> 00:28:09,316
Thank you.

319
00:28:09,398 --> 00:28:10,650
I didn't even know what it was.

320
00:28:10,733 --> 00:28:12,402
- That's fine too.
- Daddy.

321
00:28:13,068 --> 00:28:14,069
Daddy.

322
00:28:14,695 --> 00:28:16,323
Wh... What the fuck?

323
00:28:16,405 --> 00:28:19,992
We told you to count to a thousand
and wait outside.

324
00:28:20,076 --> 00:28:21,243
Is that my kid?

325
00:28:22,453 --> 00:28:23,454
End it.

326
00:28:29,376 --> 00:28:30,377
Daddy.

327
00:28:35,925 --> 00:28:36,926
We good here?

328
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,761
We're good.

329
00:28:48,438 --> 00:28:51,482
So, should we...

330
00:28:52,067 --> 00:28:53,652
We should probably call our cars.

331
00:28:55,862 --> 00:28:56,863
Yeah.

332
00:29:02,493 --> 00:29:03,494
Oh, wow.

333
00:29:06,288 --> 00:29:07,499
That's June.

334
00:29:09,084 --> 00:29:12,170
Hey, this is tonight. Like, right now.

335
00:29:13,003 --> 00:29:15,798
Should... Should we go to this, maybe?

336
00:29:16,633 --> 00:29:17,634
What is it?

337
00:29:18,468 --> 00:29:21,930
Well, it's this band.
I... I kind of know one of them.

338
00:29:23,557 --> 00:29:25,016
If it's lame, we'll leave.

339
00:29:25,517 --> 00:29:27,602
You mean
if it isn't as cool as we are.

340
00:29:29,354 --> 00:29:30,355
Exactly.

341
00:29:40,699 --> 00:29:44,118
I am feeling very old right now.

342
00:29:44,201 --> 00:29:47,038
No, you totally fit in.
Don't worry about it.

343
00:29:56,463 --> 00:29:59,342
Hi. Two beers, please.

344
00:30:04,013 --> 00:30:05,015
Hello.

345
00:30:06,557 --> 00:30:07,558
Thank you.

346
00:30:11,145 --> 00:30:16,401
Hi. Who's doing sound
in this alleyway tonight? It's terrible.

347
00:30:16,483 --> 00:30:18,278
All right, let's get this over with.

348
00:30:30,373 --> 00:30:32,791
Summer rain As I work these days

349
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:35,836
I feel a callus on my heart
'Cause every day's the same

350
00:30:35,921 --> 00:30:38,381
Broken heart, broken spirit

351
00:30:39,089 --> 00:30:41,218
Skylark's fires smash a window…

352
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,596
No filming, you fuck.

353
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:45,721
Sure, thank you.

354
00:30:45,805 --> 00:30:50,602
You can make this all come true
Build a sky in my eye that perfect blue

355
00:30:50,684 --> 00:30:53,188
I hate you, Lumon
You took my first love

356
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:56,023
Fuck you, Lumon, it's never enough

357
00:30:56,106 --> 00:30:59,736
You think that you can fight me
You are wrong to even try me

358
00:31:00,737 --> 00:31:02,364
Fuck you, Lumon!

359
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,699
I hate you, Lumon!

360
00:31:06,492 --> 00:31:08,036
Fuck you, Lumon!

361
00:31:13,875 --> 00:31:16,586
Fuck you, Lumon
You took my first love

362
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:19,506
I hate you, Lumon
It's never enough

363
00:31:19,588 --> 00:31:20,714
Fuck you, Lumon.

364
00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:24,134
I hate you, Lumon!

365
00:31:25,428 --> 00:31:27,471
Fuck you, Lumon!

366
00:31:27,556 --> 00:31:29,557
I hate you, Lumon!

367
00:31:29,641 --> 00:31:32,309
What's happening?
This is depraved.

368
00:31:32,978 --> 00:31:33,979
Hi.

369
00:31:34,938 --> 00:31:36,690
Hey, I'm…

370
00:31:36,772 --> 00:31:38,983
- The guy from work.
- Yeah.

371
00:31:41,486 --> 00:31:43,904
How are you holding up?

372
00:31:49,786 --> 00:31:51,997
Sorry. This is my friend, Alexa.

373
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:53,748
This is June.

374
00:31:53,832 --> 00:31:56,084
- Hey. You guys are really good.
- Yeah.

375
00:31:56,166 --> 00:31:58,920
Are we? I'm pretty sure we suck.

376
00:31:59,003 --> 00:32:00,713
Well, that last song was great.

377
00:32:02,089 --> 00:32:04,134
- Write what you know, right?
- Yeah.

378
00:32:06,635 --> 00:32:08,471
Your dad would've really liked it, I bet.

379
00:32:09,556 --> 00:32:10,973
- Really?
- Yeah.

380
00:32:11,849 --> 00:32:13,643
How the fuck would you even know that?

381
00:32:13,727 --> 00:32:16,313
Hey, fuck you, man.

382
00:32:19,231 --> 00:32:20,901
I think we're gonna take off.

383
00:32:21,526 --> 00:32:22,611
Yeah.

384
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,996
So…

385
00:32:35,414 --> 00:32:39,711
she's the daughter
of someone I worked with.

386
00:32:40,211 --> 00:32:42,255
He died.

387
00:32:42,338 --> 00:32:47,134
And it's...
It's been difficult to piece toge...

388
00:33:07,154 --> 00:33:08,155
Harmony.

389
00:33:09,199 --> 00:33:10,282
Did you find her?

390
00:33:10,366 --> 00:33:13,369
I got a tip from a campus cop
at Ganz College.

391
00:33:13,452 --> 00:33:15,955
She... What the fuck are you wearing?

392
00:33:17,665 --> 00:33:20,501
I was doing some private research.

393
00:33:21,336 --> 00:33:22,962
What's that a euphemism for?

394
00:33:24,588 --> 00:33:26,090
Doug, I've had a day.

395
00:33:27,133 --> 00:33:29,510
And I'm still trying to figure out

396
00:33:29,594 --> 00:33:33,847
what part of this conversation
couldn't have happened on the phone.

397
00:33:34,432 --> 00:33:37,309
Someone's holed up
in one of Ganz's old lab buildings.

398
00:33:37,394 --> 00:33:39,729
The dean's told security
to look the other way.

399
00:33:40,564 --> 00:33:42,440
Probably is Reghabi.

400
00:33:42,523 --> 00:33:43,775
It is her.

401
00:33:44,817 --> 00:33:46,278
Wanna come with me and find out?

402
00:33:47,278 --> 00:33:49,322
No, I do not.

403
00:33:50,073 --> 00:33:51,700
Let me know when you have her.

404
00:33:52,826 --> 00:33:55,287
Oh, maintenance is installing tonight.

405
00:33:55,369 --> 00:33:56,788
I think it's a good call.

406
00:33:59,249 --> 00:34:02,544
So, you're like a nurse or something?

407
00:35:16,659 --> 00:35:17,661
Hello?

408
00:35:18,911 --> 00:35:20,121
Who is this?

409
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:28,045
A friend of Petey's.

410
00:35:35,554 --> 00:35:39,724
Hello? Are... Are you there?

411
00:35:41,684 --> 00:35:42,936
Is this Mark Scout?

412
00:35:48,983 --> 00:35:50,818
What did he tell you before he died?

413
00:35:52,487 --> 00:35:53,822
Nothing.

414
00:35:53,905 --> 00:35:55,407
I just...

415
00:35:57,074 --> 00:35:59,034
I-I-I... I wanna...

416
00:36:01,621 --> 00:36:03,123
I wanna understand.

417
00:36:06,835 --> 00:36:08,085
Can you meet me now?

418
00:38:08,748 --> 00:38:09,873
Are you alone?

419
00:38:16,547 --> 00:38:18,048
Yeah, it's just me.

420
00:38:22,721 --> 00:38:24,639
I used to teach at this school.

421
00:38:24,722 --> 00:38:25,724
I know.

422
00:38:29,936 --> 00:38:30,936
Who are you?

423
00:38:36,318 --> 00:38:37,318
Come with me.
