1
00:00:57,933 --> 00:00:59,059
Do you have them?

2
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:17,119
Thank you.

3
00:03:58,864 --> 00:03:59,841
- Hey.
<i>- Hey.</i>

4
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:01,134
<i>How was the weekend thing?</i>

5
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:03,011
Uh, good, I guess.

6
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:05,930
Although my innie fell off a rope,
apparently.

7
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,599
- <i>A rope?</i>
- Mm-hmm.

8
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:09,017
<i>Are you hurt?</i>

9
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,352
No, I just got a little wet, that's all.

10
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,563
<i>Jesus, it's like it never ends
with these guys.</i>

11
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,523
<i>Do you know what the fuck
actually happened?</i>

12
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:16,798
I have no idea.

13
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:23,472
<i>Fuck. Well, how's the old, uh, "burning
shit into your eyeballs" thing going?</i>

14
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:28,453
Uh, I still can't get it
to last long enough.

15
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:31,456
<i>Okay. So, what do we do?</i>

16
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,459
Uh, just keep trying, I guess.

17
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:36,026
<i>Do you have any other ideas?</i>

18
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,509
Uh, hey, I'm sorry. I gotta get to work.

19
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:44,826
- <i>All right. Bye.</i>
- Yeah. Bye.

20
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:48,497
- Hey.
- You need to get your dryer fixed.

21
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:52,685
Yeah. Or you could just,
like, not live here.

22
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,128
I can't keep coming in and out.

23
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,830
You think they're watching us?

24
00:04:58,382 --> 00:05:00,342
Depends on how dumb you've played it.

25
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,322
Hey, when do we keep going?

26
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:06,616
Maybe tonight. I'll decide later.

27
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,184
'Cause I haven't remembered anything else.

28
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:12,604
Right. Well, maybe your innie has.

29
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:50,851
You took the rest of the weekend
to recover?

30
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:52,853
I'm fine.

31
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:56,064
Will I be updating Father later?

32
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,863
He should hear it from me.

33
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:11,079
We have decided to spare him knowledge
of this contretemps.

34
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:20,047
Well, please let him know
that his daughter is alive and well.

35
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:24,134
The medical team
says your tempers will rebalance quickly.

36
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,070
Good to hear.

37
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:31,058
Some residual trauma is to be expected
after such an ordeal.

38
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,479
Perhaps we could arrange
another obligement session this evening.

39
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,481
I said I'm fine.

40
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:39,983
We're close, Helena.

41
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:43,463
What's he at, 78%?

42
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:46,365
Eighty-one. As of Friday.

43
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,492
It won't be much longer.

44
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:50,285
You can do this.

45
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:55,082
I'm not going back down there.

46
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,127
It won't be you. It will be your innie.

47
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,756
My innie who tried to kill me?

48
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:06,635
And then the other one tried to kill me.

49
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,682
They're fucking animals.

50
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:19,707
I'll just fake it again.

51
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:21,275
We can't take that chance.

52
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,628
We need to clean this up.

53
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:27,531
Milchick's many errors this weekend
have forced our hand.

54
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:30,450
And Father approves?

55
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:34,246
Father encouraged it.

56
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:39,835
<i>It's a risk.</i>

57
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:41,587
<i>We know this.</i>

58
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:45,090
<i>But there is no other solution.</i>

59
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,677
<i>Mark S. won't work without her.</i>

60
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:52,347
And the work is mysterious and important.

61
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:55,559
So we must give him her.

62
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,901
<i>The Board
appreciates your sacrifice.</i>

63
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,182
Good morning, Helly R.

64
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,727
Who the fuck are you?

65
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:45,734
I'm Miss Huang.

66
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:50,113
What the hell?

67
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:52,282
Please follow me.

68
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,743
Mr. Milchick will explain.

69
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:26,543
- Hey.
- Hey.

70
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:29,194
- Is she...
- Her innie.

71
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:32,155
MDR.

72
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:35,200
Together again.

73
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:36,952
Come on in.

74
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:39,806
I need to know what's going on.

75
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:40,890
Like, right now.

76
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,308
Where's Irving?

77
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:43,893
And why was he trying to drown me?

78
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,169
'Cause you're a fucking Eagan.

79
00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:48,606
- Was she spying on us?
- Wait, what?

80
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,816
The whole time.

81
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,592
It's called a Glasgow block.

82
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,738
- It allows one's outie to--
- Wait, wait, wait.

83
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,639
Are you saying that she was down here?

84
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,117
As me?

85
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:00,451
Maybe she still is.

86
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:03,288
Hey, I repeat myself. Where is Irving?

87
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:05,331
- Yeah, where is he?
- I'm so confused.

88
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,167
Answer my question!

89
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:08,901
Excuse me.

90
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:21,205
Helena Eagan, in her executive capacity,
was conducting valuable research.

91
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:24,750
By stealing my fucking body?

92
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:29,505
Irving had no knowledge of what
management's intention was in this action,

93
00:10:30,923 --> 00:10:33,717
and in so doing, he nearly drowned you.

94
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:39,640
Our only option was permanent dismissal.

95
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:45,437
So he is dead?

96
00:10:47,523 --> 00:10:48,524
No.

97
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:52,444
Irving B's outie has departed
on an elongated cruise voyage.

98
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:57,258
I don't give three dry fucks
about his outie.

99
00:10:57,282 --> 00:11:02,162
She doesn't... She doesn't have
the right to ta... to take my identity.

100
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:13,215
Have you ever heard the story
of the <i>Gråkappan</i>?

101
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:25,060
Uh, let's assume we haven't.

102
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:34,879
In ancient times,
the king of Sweden himself

103
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:38,341
was known to go incognito
amongst his people

104
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:41,702
in the hopes of learning
their true grievances.

105
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:47,749
He would don an old, gray robe,
a <i>Gråkappan</i>,

106
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,919
the name for which he was remembered,

107
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:55,465
to disguise his royal vestments.

108
00:11:56,466 --> 00:12:00,446
Kier Eagan himself was known
to do so in his ether factories,

109
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:06,018
and Ms. Eagan
was carrying on this noble tradition.

110
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:13,192
This smells like horseshit.

111
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:17,905
Yeah. Swedish horseshit,
and Irving is still dead.

112
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:23,052
As I said, Irving B's outie
has departed on an elonga--

113
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,138
On an elongated cruise voyage.
Yeah, I know.

114
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:26,914
Is he gonna come back or not?

115
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:42,721
He is not.

116
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:48,393
Wow. Some actual honesty.

117
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,332
You fucking murderers.

118
00:12:52,356 --> 00:12:54,107
You can't do this to people.

119
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:58,195
It will take time to absorb
all that has occurred.

120
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:03,283
This went well.

121
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,455
Allow me to escort you to MDR

122
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:12,709
and help reacclimate you
to your work environment.

123
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:34,064
What in the abominable fuck?

124
00:13:47,286 --> 00:13:48,513
This is you.

125
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:50,622
Hell no. I'm not going near that thing.

126
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,917
Dylan, please.

127
00:13:58,547 --> 00:14:00,525
If you're taking feedback,
I hate it.

128
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:01,842
Same.

129
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:12,728
Well, the ORTBO was a challenge for us all
in ways expected and non.

130
00:14:19,318 --> 00:14:22,654
You mean like Jame Eagan's daughter
<i>Gråkappanning</i> us?

131
00:14:24,323 --> 00:14:28,678
Careful, Dylan. Words have consequences.

132
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:31,330
I'd hate to rescind certain privileges.

133
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,060
As you can see, all of your items

134
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:38,629
have been moved
to your new work tri-stations.

135
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:40,857
Hall passes will still be available.

136
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:42,341
Let us have a funeral.

137
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,635
I'm sorry?

138
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:48,114
Irving is a person, and he's gone.

139
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:49,223
So,

140
00:14:50,474 --> 00:14:51,850
we'd like to have a funeral.

141
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:57,064
Not a retirement party, a funeral.

142
00:14:58,065 --> 00:14:59,066
Right?

143
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,361
Yeah.

144
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:06,365
A funeral.

145
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:10,428
Is this MDR's position?

146
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:11,620
Dude?

147
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:13,580
Little help?

148
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:19,062
Uh, sure. As long as it's quick.

149
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:21,231
- Quick?
- Quick. Yes.

150
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:23,608
So it doesn't take up the whole day.

151
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:25,092
Well said, Mark.

152
00:15:25,801 --> 00:15:27,612
I'll see if we can
pull something together.

153
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:32,140
In the meantime, let's make some
forward progress on the files at hand.

154
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:33,642
Shall we?

155
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:35,769
Thank you.

156
00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:38,438
Not you.

157
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:05,150
Miss Huang, we need to ready
a bereavement kit for MDR.

158
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:06,717
Meet me in the back office.

159
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:19,730
Mark?

160
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:22,149
Hello?

161
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:26,921
I'm gonna come in.

162
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:28,029
I'm coming in.

163
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:33,702
Hey.

164
00:16:36,455 --> 00:16:37,682
Are you okay?

165
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:40,209
Uh-huh. No, not really.

166
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:44,105
Yeah. This is seriously fucked up.

167
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:45,214
Yeah.

168
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:52,387
You couldn't tell?

169
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:54,348
That she wasn't me?

170
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:57,601
Obviously not.

171
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:00,562
What was she like?

172
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,942
Uh...

173
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:07,670
Like you.

174
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:11,549
Or you're like her? I don't know.

175
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:15,160
I don't know who you are, I guess.

176
00:17:17,913 --> 00:17:19,540
Yes, you do.

177
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:21,375
Okay.

178
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,106
It's-It's not my fault
that my outie hijacked me.

179
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:30,217
Yeah. No.
No, totally. I get it. It s-sucks.

180
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:35,698
- Mark...
- Yeah.

181
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:37,474
What happened to you up there?

182
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:40,995
Doesn't matter.

183
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:42,539
- It doesn't matter?
- No.

184
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:44,123
Don't you want to hear
what happened to me?

185
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:48,317
No, I don't. And, uh,
let's just try to forget it. Okay?

186
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:17,014
I thought bereavement events
were for innies who die on the floor.

187
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:20,058
Yes.

188
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:25,189
Well, the Affections Index for Irving B.
was in the high 60s.

189
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:28,025
It will help the others to grieve.

190
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:34,865
May I say a question?

191
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:36,658
You may.

192
00:18:39,912 --> 00:18:42,247
You shouldn't let them have a funeral.

193
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,959
It makes them feel like people.

194
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:49,755
That wasn't a question.

195
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:51,757
That was an opinion.

196
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:54,468
Unsolicited.

197
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:09,149
Your first performance review
is today, right?

198
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:21,370
That was a question.

199
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,227
I'll ready the refreshments.

200
00:19:27,251 --> 00:19:29,586
You focus on the mournful signage.

201
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:43,267
<i>Today we honor Irving B.</i>

202
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:47,413
<i>Normally, when an innie
goes to be with Kier,</i>

203
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:51,275
<i>we hold a retirement party,
which they attend.</i>

204
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:56,321
But given the sudden
and frigid events which brought us here,

205
00:19:57,281 --> 00:19:58,574
that's not feasible.

206
00:20:00,117 --> 00:20:02,470
As such, let us each take nine seconds

207
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:07,583
to silently remember Irving
and thank Kier for our time with him.

208
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:16,383
There. You may now lift your heads
and open your eyes.

209
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:19,845
We will now have a eulogy from Dylan G.

210
00:20:36,153 --> 00:20:38,822
It's hard to pinpoint
a favorite Irving story.

211
00:20:40,616 --> 00:20:43,243
For the least fun guy in the world,
he was really fun.

212
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:47,664
He put the "dick" in contradiction.

213
00:20:50,501 --> 00:20:53,754
One time, he was pissed at me
for watering down the toner,

214
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:56,715
so he put toner in my water cup.

215
00:20:57,966 --> 00:20:59,360
He stopped me before I drank it, though.

216
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:03,055
He just wanted to make a point,
not harm me physically.

217
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:09,645
But I did accidentally take a sip of it
later 'cause I forgot he said that.

218
00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:17,194
He asked me for help with something
near the end, and I didn't listen.

219
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:21,090
And in his final moments,

220
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:25,702
he would have been totally justified
in telling me to suck my own fuck.

221
00:21:26,495 --> 00:21:28,038
But he didn't.

222
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,251
Yeah.

223
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:37,464
He was awesome, and I miss him.

224
00:21:42,594 --> 00:21:44,137
Thank you, Dylan G.

225
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:48,600
A little sugar with your usual salt.

226
00:21:52,938 --> 00:21:55,649
Thank you for your attendance
and your participation.

227
00:21:56,567 --> 00:22:00,737
You may now briefly partake
in Irving's fruit head,

228
00:22:01,446 --> 00:22:04,741
whose dark hair is courtesy
of the Black Beauty Watermelon.

229
00:22:05,242 --> 00:22:07,828
From the country of Malaysia.

230
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:13,667
Miss Huang.

231
00:22:28,182 --> 00:22:29,784
I thought I was going to perform.

232
00:22:29,808 --> 00:22:33,187
Yes, well, I feel the theremin
works best in moderation.

233
00:22:33,687 --> 00:22:36,106
- But I practiced--
- You can play your piece for me later.

234
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:37,691
Yes?

235
00:23:02,674 --> 00:23:03,759
You okay?

236
00:23:06,261 --> 00:23:07,596
How about you?

237
00:23:08,222 --> 00:23:09,222
Okay.

238
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:14,728
You're not staying?

239
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:18,708
I gotta get to work,
but great ceremony, guys.

240
00:23:18,732 --> 00:23:20,067
Seriously?

241
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:24,613
I mean, isn't it kind of over?

242
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:26,382
Mark...

243
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:27,741
Just let him go.

244
00:23:29,034 --> 00:23:32,388
- What?
- Irving was your friend, and he's dead.

245
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:35,141
- Why don't you give a shit?
- Because he's not dead.

246
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:36,834
He's just not here.

247
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:40,128
You two catch up?

248
00:23:41,505 --> 00:23:42,506
What's that?

249
00:23:45,342 --> 00:23:47,177
You tell her Ms. Casey's your wife yet?

250
00:23:50,806 --> 00:23:51,974
Wait, what?

251
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:55,745
Yeah, I mean,
it's my outie's wife, but sure...

252
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:58,522
No, it's pretty crazy.

253
00:24:00,566 --> 00:24:01,567
Mark.

254
00:24:05,404 --> 00:24:07,573
Mark, what the hell?

255
00:24:09,575 --> 00:24:11,845
- Why won't you talk to me?
- What do you want to talk about, Helly?

256
00:24:11,869 --> 00:24:14,705
Uh, I don't know. Maybe the fact
that Ms. Casey's your outie's wife?

257
00:24:15,205 --> 00:24:16,206
What are we gonna do?

258
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:19,060
Well, we're not gonna do anything.

259
00:24:19,084 --> 00:24:20,145
Not gonna do anything?

260
00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:23,189
- Seriously?
- Yes. Seriously.

261
00:24:23,213 --> 00:24:26,109
Come on. We'll work as a team.
We'll figure this out.

262
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:29,195
- "We'll"? There's no "we," Helly.
- What?

263
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:31,698
- It doesn't matter.
- Why?

264
00:24:31,722 --> 00:24:32,824
- Why?
- Yeah. Why?

265
00:24:32,848 --> 00:24:35,493
Because they are smarter than us, okay?

266
00:24:35,517 --> 00:24:37,120
They know everything.

267
00:24:37,144 --> 00:24:39,747
Me looking for Ms. Casey,

268
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:42,375
us wandering around,
meeting other departments,

269
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:43,835
mapping the floor, all of it.

270
00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:45,795
They know everything we're doing

271
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:49,907
because Helena told them
everything we're doing.

272
00:24:50,574 --> 00:24:51,759
That wasn't me.

273
00:24:51,783 --> 00:24:55,662
Mark, lo... I'm not her. I'm not.

274
00:24:57,581 --> 00:24:58,707
I'm me.

275
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:01,835
Helly.

276
00:25:03,045 --> 00:25:04,546
And how do I know that?

277
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:12,346
You... You don't.

278
00:25:14,598 --> 00:25:16,225
You just have to trust me.

279
00:25:20,812 --> 00:25:22,147
This is real.

280
00:25:27,528 --> 00:25:29,571
Not everything here is a lie.

281
00:25:36,662 --> 00:25:38,664
And stop being a fucking asshole.

282
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:51,301
Your first performance review
as Department Chief. Excited?

283
00:25:53,887 --> 00:25:55,180
Very much so.

284
00:25:56,306 --> 00:25:57,575
Shall we?

285
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:00,161
Natalie, just before we begin,

286
00:26:00,185 --> 00:26:02,396
I was wondering
if I could have a word with you.

287
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:10,362
The paintings.

288
00:26:12,114 --> 00:26:15,200
I want you to understand
I am grateful for them.

289
00:26:15,868 --> 00:26:16,869
Truly.

290
00:26:17,494 --> 00:26:20,789
If they're a measure of appreciation,
then I accept that appreciation.

291
00:26:27,671 --> 00:26:29,941
I was just wondering
if you could share with me a little

292
00:26:29,965 --> 00:26:33,927
how you felt
when you received the paintings.

293
00:26:34,887 --> 00:26:35,888
Because I'm thinking

294
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:40,017
our experiences here
have been similar in some ways,

295
00:26:41,768 --> 00:26:43,687
we face similar challenges,

296
00:26:44,438 --> 00:26:48,859
and perhaps the paintings and the
somewhat complicated feelings they evoke.

297
00:26:57,534 --> 00:26:58,785
Mr. Drummond's waiting.

298
00:27:00,454 --> 00:27:01,830
Yes, of course.

299
00:27:04,917 --> 00:27:05,918
Let us go.

300
00:27:21,642 --> 00:27:23,727
Okay, asshole.

301
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:25,812
Guess this is it.

302
00:27:27,856 --> 00:27:29,149
Sorry I let you down.

303
00:28:34,339 --> 00:28:35,841
<i>Welcome, Mr. Milchick.</i>

304
00:28:36,967 --> 00:28:40,429
{\an8}Today, I will be conducting
your monthly performance review.

305
00:28:41,305 --> 00:28:43,741
This review can take
anywhere from two to six hours,

306
00:28:43,765 --> 00:28:47,579
depending on the number of atonements
and approbations required.

307
00:28:47,603 --> 00:28:50,248
If the review is to take longer
than four hours,

308
00:28:50,272 --> 00:28:54,544
there will be a break for lunch,
with the order taken in advance.

309
00:28:54,568 --> 00:28:56,820
Well, I hope that won't be necessary.

310
00:28:59,281 --> 00:29:01,033
Here is the lunch menu.

311
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:11,835
Let's start with the positives.

312
00:29:12,336 --> 00:29:16,649
You received the gift
of Kier paintings with grace.

313
00:29:16,673 --> 00:29:19,861
Your attendance and urinalysis
are both in the excellent range.

314
00:29:19,885 --> 00:29:21,362
Wonderful.

315
00:29:21,386 --> 00:29:23,948
Alternatively and sadly,

316
00:29:23,972 --> 00:29:27,976
there have been three contentions
reported anonymously

317
00:29:28,685 --> 00:29:31,104
which have been investigated
and confirmed.

318
00:29:32,773 --> 00:29:33,750
Oh.

319
00:29:33,774 --> 00:29:36,860
"One: uses too many big words."

320
00:29:38,862 --> 00:29:41,299
Well, perchance I may
colloquially employ a--

321
00:29:41,323 --> 00:29:44,826
Anti-deflections will be heard
after the lunch break.

322
00:29:45,494 --> 00:29:46,471
Yes, sorry.

323
00:29:46,495 --> 00:29:50,600
Two: on several of your daily logs,

324
00:29:50,624 --> 00:29:53,728
the paper clip
was installed back to front,

325
00:29:53,752 --> 00:29:58,298
which led to a confusion as to where
in the document to begin reading.

326
00:29:59,007 --> 00:30:01,218
Here are the incidents.

327
00:30:03,053 --> 00:30:07,224
But the bulk of our day
will revolve around the following.

328
00:30:07,766 --> 00:30:11,996
You brought in
a new refining team for Mark S.

329
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,022
which failed to coalesce.

330
00:30:14,523 --> 00:30:16,501
You instituted kindness reforms.

331
00:30:16,525 --> 00:30:18,503
Because I'm not Harmony Cobel.

332
00:30:18,527 --> 00:30:23,716
Kindness reforms
that seemed to have, in no way,

333
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:28,263
deterred curiosity or idling by the team
once they returned.

334
00:30:28,287 --> 00:30:32,767
You arranged an outdoor retreat
and team-building occurrence

335
00:30:32,791 --> 00:30:35,502
which resulted in the termination
of one employee,

336
00:30:36,086 --> 00:30:38,690
and the discovery
of the true identity of another

337
00:30:38,714 --> 00:30:41,758
at great risk and harm to the Eagan name.

338
00:30:59,276 --> 00:31:04,281
{\an8}<i>Look, Seth, Mark Scout's completion
of Cold Harbor...</i>

339
00:31:05,157 --> 00:31:06,509
will be remembered

340
00:31:06,533 --> 00:31:10,370
as one of the greatest moments
in the history of this planet.

341
00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:14,499
It will take place under your stewardship.

342
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:17,437
<i>That's quite a legacy you will leave.</i>

343
00:31:17,461 --> 00:31:18,670
<i>Thank you, Mr. Drummond.</i>

344
00:31:19,838 --> 00:31:21,381
That means a great deal.

345
00:31:24,218 --> 00:31:27,179
<i>This milestone
seems to have clouded your judgment.</i>

346
00:31:27,763 --> 00:31:31,099
I think it's time to go
back to the basics, Seth.

347
00:31:31,683 --> 00:31:34,603
To remember these severed workers'
greater purpose...

348
00:31:39,566 --> 00:31:43,237
and to treat them as what they really are.

349
00:32:30,909 --> 00:32:32,494
I'm tightening the leash.

350
00:32:53,265 --> 00:32:54,266
Hi, Mark.

351
00:32:54,808 --> 00:32:56,202
Mr. Milchick.

352
00:32:56,226 --> 00:32:58,705
I see you left work
six minutes early.

353
00:32:58,729 --> 00:32:59,938
May I come in?

354
00:33:08,363 --> 00:33:10,199
How was the rest of the funeral?

355
00:33:11,033 --> 00:33:12,826
Did you get what you needed from it?

356
00:33:14,369 --> 00:33:16,038
Yeah, sure.

357
00:33:18,332 --> 00:33:21,502
Hey, did Miss Huang take notes?

358
00:33:22,503 --> 00:33:26,399
I can't wait to read her article about it
in that newspaper you showed me.

359
00:33:26,423 --> 00:33:27,883
What was it called again?

360
00:33:28,884 --> 00:33:31,178
<i>The Bullshit Gazette</i>?

361
00:33:33,847 --> 00:33:37,744
Hopefully, now we can put
all this grief and tumult behind us

362
00:33:37,768 --> 00:33:40,705
and look forward
to some productive workdays ahead.

363
00:33:40,729 --> 00:33:44,042
Oh, you mean
putting the numbers in the thing--

364
00:33:44,066 --> 00:33:45,460
- Refining.
- Right.

365
00:33:45,484 --> 00:33:47,754
Yes. Does that sound good?

366
00:33:47,778 --> 00:33:49,964
Whatever you say, Mr. Milchick.

367
00:33:49,988 --> 00:33:51,240
Praise Kier.

368
00:34:00,916 --> 00:34:02,668
Did you and Helly R. catch up?

369
00:34:04,169 --> 00:34:05,063
We did.

370
00:34:05,087 --> 00:34:08,465
Did you tell her that you
fucked her outie at the ORTBO?

371
00:34:14,012 --> 00:34:15,389
Helena Eagan,

372
00:34:16,473 --> 00:34:18,684
leader-in-waiting of this company.

373
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,612
Have a restful evening.

374
00:34:51,842 --> 00:34:53,510
<i>"The workers were diligent,</i>

375
00:34:54,261 --> 00:34:56,138
<i>focused on the task at hand.</i>

376
00:34:57,639 --> 00:35:01,727
<i>Pleasantly surprised, I noticed
that not a single worker had a watch.</i>

377
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:05,772
<i>They simply referenced
a large standard clock near the door,</i>

378
00:35:06,356 --> 00:35:09,193
<i>just hands and numbers
and cogs and purpose.</i>

379
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:13,214
Your sovereign boss may own the clock
that greets you from the wall,

380
00:35:13,238 --> 00:35:16,992
but you get to enjoy its ticking
and thus should be happy."

381
00:35:20,204 --> 00:35:21,181
Yes.

382
00:35:21,205 --> 00:35:24,374
Babe, it's the literal opposite
of what you were saying before.

383
00:35:26,168 --> 00:35:27,169
Okay.

384
00:35:27,753 --> 00:35:31,149
I-- I see how you'd feel that way.

385
00:35:31,173 --> 00:35:33,234
But one point that Nat made was--

386
00:35:33,258 --> 00:35:34,343
Nat, okay.

387
00:35:35,969 --> 00:35:40,575
She said that innies tend to thrive
in an environment of structure,

388
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:42,327
and once that is established,

389
00:35:42,351 --> 00:35:45,163
then they are more open to self-expansion.

390
00:35:45,187 --> 00:35:47,707
So I am just trying
to speak their language.

391
00:35:47,731 --> 00:35:50,126
I know, but this sounds
like Lumon's language.

392
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:52,962
Well, it's a Trojan's horse.

393
00:35:52,986 --> 00:35:56,466
If I can get my ideas
to severed workers all across the world,

394
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:59,594
it might beget a revolution.

395
00:35:59,618 --> 00:36:01,370
But these aren't your ideas.

396
00:36:01,995 --> 00:36:04,474
These are not your ideas, and also...

397
00:36:04,498 --> 00:36:05,582
Whatever.

398
00:36:06,291 --> 00:36:07,268
And what?

399
00:36:07,292 --> 00:36:10,522
Okay, Lumon hurts people, you know that,
and if you want to water down your work

400
00:36:10,546 --> 00:36:12,732
so they can use it
for their fucking propaganda,

401
00:36:12,756 --> 00:36:14,150
then you're hurting people too.

402
00:36:14,174 --> 00:36:17,695
Okay. I will reflect on your words.

403
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:18,846
Thank you.

404
00:36:20,931 --> 00:36:23,433
And also,

405
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:28,498
this is a fiscal and creative opportunity

406
00:36:28,522 --> 00:36:30,524
unlike any I have yet seen.

407
00:36:32,025 --> 00:36:34,611
And I'm not inclined
to just walk away from it.

408
00:36:36,697 --> 00:36:40,051
Unless me selling
millions of copies of my book

409
00:36:40,075 --> 00:36:44,705
and the life that that manages to give us
has somehow lost its appeal for you.

410
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:49,501
Okay. Whatever. I'm gonna go to bed.

411
00:36:50,085 --> 00:36:52,438
No. Babe.

412
00:36:52,462 --> 00:36:53,630
No, thank you.

413
00:37:52,981 --> 00:37:54,358
It's me again.

414
00:37:55,234 --> 00:37:57,962
So, they fired me.

415
00:37:57,986 --> 00:38:00,548
I think they knew what my innie was up to.

416
00:38:00,572 --> 00:38:02,199
I'm telling you to--

417
00:38:04,451 --> 00:38:05,451
I have to go.

418
00:38:14,127 --> 00:38:15,128
Hey!

419
00:38:17,256 --> 00:38:18,257
Hey!

420
00:38:19,258 --> 00:38:22,010
You. Why are you following me?

421
00:38:26,431 --> 00:38:27,492
I got this thing.

422
00:38:27,516 --> 00:38:33,146
When somebody shows up on my doorstep
screaming my name, I wanna know why.

423
00:38:33,647 --> 00:38:35,023
Call it a quirk.

424
00:38:37,401 --> 00:38:38,735
You're with Lumon.

425
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,909
Why were you at my house the other night?

426
00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:50,539
I don't know.

427
00:38:51,582 --> 00:38:54,251
It wasn't you at all, was it?

428
00:38:54,751 --> 00:38:55,752
You're severed.

429
00:39:01,216 --> 00:39:03,820
I got canned a couple of weeks ago.

430
00:39:03,844 --> 00:39:05,155
When I pressed them for a reason,

431
00:39:05,179 --> 00:39:10,243
they said my innie had an unsanctioned,
erotic entanglement with another worker.

432
00:39:10,267 --> 00:39:11,852
They wouldn't tell me who.

433
00:39:14,188 --> 00:39:17,274
Then you show up at my door.

434
00:39:22,654 --> 00:39:24,323
You think we were an item?

435
00:39:24,948 --> 00:39:27,093
Well, Fields certainly thinks so.

436
00:39:27,117 --> 00:39:30,162
We had to cancel our trip to Milwaukee.
Thanks for that.

437
00:39:31,246 --> 00:39:34,791
- Fields?
- That's my husband, Fields.

438
00:39:35,417 --> 00:39:37,353
I'm, uh... I'm sorry.

439
00:39:37,377 --> 00:39:38,855
Yeah, well...

440
00:39:38,879 --> 00:39:41,381
And I'm sorry I came at you just now.

441
00:39:44,134 --> 00:39:45,177
It's fine.

442
00:39:50,724 --> 00:39:53,435
Maybe you could... I don't know.

443
00:39:54,686 --> 00:39:55,687
What?

444
00:39:57,231 --> 00:40:00,234
We got a ham.
We're planning to have it tomorrow.

445
00:40:00,734 --> 00:40:05,364
Might be nice if you come over.
We could sit down, talk through it all.

446
00:40:08,784 --> 00:40:10,285
You, me, and...

447
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:12,120
Fields.

448
00:40:17,793 --> 00:40:19,062
I suppose.

449
00:40:19,086 --> 00:40:20,295
Great.

450
00:40:21,797 --> 00:40:22,965
We like red wine.

451
00:40:23,715 --> 00:40:24,692
Expensive.

452
00:40:24,716 --> 00:40:26,844
Okay. Tomorrow.

453
00:40:28,929 --> 00:40:30,013
You need a lift?

454
00:40:30,806 --> 00:40:32,242
I'll walk. Thanks.

455
00:40:32,266 --> 00:40:33,350
You sure?

456
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,019
I know where you live.

457
00:40:41,483 --> 00:40:44,403
- See you tomorrow.
- Yes.

458
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:21,648
Uh, sorry there wasn't any eggnog.

459
00:41:22,191 --> 00:41:23,942
Might be out of season.

460
00:41:25,694 --> 00:41:27,046
What the fuck are you doing?

461
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:30,240
I needed some pressure points.
Things to rattle your memories.

462
00:41:30,782 --> 00:41:31,885
- Knitting?
- Yeah.

463
00:41:31,909 --> 00:41:34,578
She said it gave her time to think.

464
00:41:39,374 --> 00:41:40,375
That her?

465
00:41:42,461 --> 00:41:44,004
What I thought was her.

466
00:41:51,845 --> 00:41:54,264
She's not dead. She's just not here.

467
00:41:57,643 --> 00:41:58,977
Who's in there?

468
00:42:00,437 --> 00:42:02,415
They know people at the morgue.

469
00:42:02,439 --> 00:42:03,500
On the payroll,

470
00:42:03,524 --> 00:42:05,943
like everywhere else in Kier.

471
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:11,007
You feel all right?

472
00:42:11,031 --> 00:42:13,593
Mmm. Basically.

473
00:42:13,617 --> 00:42:16,763
So, uh, are... are... are we gonna...

474
00:42:16,787 --> 00:42:17,871
One more day.

475
00:42:19,498 --> 00:42:21,041
Usually that's best.

476
00:42:22,084 --> 00:42:24,354
Usually? You've done this once.

477
00:42:24,378 --> 00:42:25,814
I don't wanna rush things.

478
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:27,065
There's risk.

479
00:42:27,089 --> 00:42:28,817
It's not an exact science, Mark.

480
00:42:28,841 --> 00:42:32,135
I'm not sure it's science,
period, but okay.

481
00:42:35,305 --> 00:42:36,890
You good on snacks?

482
00:42:37,474 --> 00:42:38,517
For now.

483
00:42:58,412 --> 00:42:59,746
Are they hurting her?

484
00:43:04,126 --> 00:43:05,419
I don't know.

485
00:43:15,345 --> 00:43:16,322
<i>Your outie.</i>

486
00:43:16,346 --> 00:43:17,431
What?

487
00:43:18,849 --> 00:43:20,267
I didn't say anything.

488
00:43:29,109 --> 00:43:33,947
<i>Your outie
can parallel park in less than 20 seconds.</i>

489
00:43:45,375 --> 00:43:48,837
<i>Your outie can roller-skate with grace.</i>

490
00:43:54,426 --> 00:43:59,806
<i>Your outie pays all of his gas and
electric bills within three business days.</i>

491
00:44:20,869 --> 00:44:27,084
<i>Your outie listens to music
while shaving, but not while showering.</i>

492
00:44:35,676 --> 00:44:39,596
<i>Your outie prefers two scoops
of ice cream in a serving,</i>

493
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:43,892
<i>but they must be the same flavor.</i>

494
00:44:50,232 --> 00:44:54,403
<i>Your outie once captured a butterfly.</i>

495
00:45:03,662 --> 00:45:06,081
Your outie is going to--
