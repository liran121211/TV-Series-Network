1
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,526
<i>Devon!</i>

2
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:16,236
<i>No, no, no. Listen, we're
not happy. We're miserable.</i>

3
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,286
<i>Burt!</i>

4
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:19,946
<i>They torture us down there!</i>

5
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:21,036
<i>Devon!</i>

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,866
- <i>We're prisoners!
- Burt!</i>

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,390
<i>She's alive!</i>

8
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,970
I suppose you're Mark s.

9
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,970
- I...
- I'm Mark w.

10
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:49,770
Who are you people?

11
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,536
Would you be open to
using a different first name

12
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,110
to avoid confusion?

13
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,360
Welcome back, Mark s.

14
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,120
Been a minute.

15
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:15,856
Where are they?

16
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,936
I think it's best to save any queries

17
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,816
till we arrive at the management office.

18
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,066
Were they fired?

19
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:24,156
You can leave the balloons
in the foyer by my old desk.

20
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,736
We've much to discuss, and I
don't want them distracting you.

21
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,236
I assure you, they won't be taken.

22
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,406
Mr. Milchick, please.

23
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,206
What you all did five months ago

24
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,956
was one of the most painful
moments in the history of this company.

25
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:35,877
Five months?

26
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:37,916
I, too, was wounded by it.

27
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:42,546
But we must be cut to heal, mustn't we?

28
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:44,426
Wait, did you say your old office?

29
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,836
Mark, this is miss huang.

30
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,426
Miss huang, Mark s.

31
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:48,530
Hello.

32
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,830
She'll be happy to mind
your balloons while we chat.

33
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:54,370
Right this way, Mark.

34
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:01,170
You can shut it.

35
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,680
Is it normal for a child
to... excuse the clutter.

36
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,850
Okay. What's happening?

37
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,770
Ms. Cobel is no longer
with this company.

38
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,190
I now manage the severed floor.

39
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:24,650
What about my team?

40
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,360
We didn't fire them.

41
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,056
Helly r. And Irving b. Both successfully
made contact with persons on the outside,

42
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,330
just as you did.

43
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,000
Dylan g.'S outie learned
what happened after the fact.

44
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,300
The four of you have
achieved international fame.

45
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:47,446
As a group, you've become known
as the face of severance reform.

46
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,470
- Severance ref...
- Have a seat, Mark.

47
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,366
Shortly before your mutiny,
we installed security doors

48
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,980
to keep you in mdr.

49
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:59,860
This accompanied a punitive rendition
of the kier hymn performed by Ms. Cobel.

50
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,690
Do you recall?

51
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,030
I do.

52
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,660
I locked you in a room
like an animal, Mark.

53
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,057
As an unsevered man,

54
00:06:15,081 --> 00:06:17,500
I'll carry that knowledge
the rest of my life.

55
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:20,936
But for the past five months,

56
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,936
we've been asking how a
sadist like Harmony cobel

57
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,550
could take fertile root in lumon soil.

58
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,550
And what that says about us.

59
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,366
We also know Ms. Cobel
was at your sister's home

60
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,850
when you awoke there.

61
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,690
Yeah. Why was that?

62
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:43,230
We believe she'd developed
an erotic fixation on you

63
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,126
and had plans to pursue
both you and your outie

64
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:48,070
in what might be termed "a throuple."

65
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,070
What?

66
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,530
Thankfully, she failed at this.

67
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,210
You still haven't told
me where my team is.

68
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,880
We tried for weeks to
get them back, Mark.

69
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:07,710
None of them agreed.

70
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:12,930
We told them of the
reforms, but it wasn't enough.

71
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,640
Except for me?

72
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,850
Your outie insisted on returning.

73
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,440
In fact, he begged us to
let him back right away.

74
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,990
So the others, they refused?

75
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:34,990
Yes.

76
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:41,120
Well, I'd like to hear it from them.

77
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,130
That's not possible.

78
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,350
Enjoy your balloons.

79
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:23,186
Yeah. We showed up
about an hour before you did.

80
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:26,146
It's a little cramped
compared to our old mdr,

81
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:27,646
but I love the green carpet.

82
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:30,236
Ours was a crème brûlée
and the keyboards were puce.

83
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,147
They were purple.

84
00:08:31,171 --> 00:08:33,736
No. They were puce. I know
because it makes me nauseous,

85
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,906
and I hate sweets.

86
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:38,050
Speaking of which, how much
do we see of that Mr. "milkshake"?

87
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:40,076
Milchick.

88
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,100
What?

89
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,916
It's milchick, not
milkshake. And I don't know.

90
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:51,256
Marco, where I can
find some ink pencils?

91
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,360
Supply closet.

92
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,330
I'll show ya.

93
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,420
- So, did you really see the outie world?
- Yeah.

94
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,567
How's the sky?

95
00:09:11,591 --> 00:09:12,760
I don't know.

96
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:16,106
- What, you didn't see it?
- Well, I went outside for a second,

97
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:18,550
but I was distracted by my brother-in-law.

98
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,657
Seriously?

99
00:09:20,681 --> 00:09:23,496
Because we made a list of what
we'd most like to see on the outside.

100
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,996
And sky was an easy number one.

101
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,416
Brothers-in-law weren't even on the list.

102
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,440
<i>Grazie.</i>

103
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,836
Could you tell what state we were in?

104
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,586
Because three of us put
Wyoming on our input survey.

105
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:35,966
- Did you see any buttes?
- No.

106
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,967
My god. How's wind?

107
00:09:36,991 --> 00:09:38,636
Is it just like getting
breathed on, kind of?

108
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,136
Hello, refiners.

109
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,676
Hello, miss huang.

110
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,950
No. It's the ball game.

111
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,160
Let's head to the kitchenette.

112
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,720
Okay. So,

113
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,480
my name is miss huang.

114
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:09,190
It's my first day here as deputy manager.

115
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:16,400
I guess something about me is that
before this, I was a crossing guard.

116
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:26,540
Mark w.?

117
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:28,790
Why are you a child?

118
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,170
Because of when I was born.

119
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,566
Right. I'm Mark w.

120
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:43,326
I'm from the mdr
department of branch 5x,

121
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,350
where I worked with Gwendolyn y.

122
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:51,206
Kind of a fun fact about me is that
I thought I'd be permanently retired

123
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,980
when my branch shut down.

124
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,780
So this is a nice surprise.

125
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,030
Mark s.?

126
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,240
Okay.

127
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,010
I'm Mark s.

128
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,800
And I've been here about two years.

129
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,640
Something about me...

130
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:44,740
Is...

131
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:54,170
That I am lucky enough to have
made four new friends today.

132
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,920
That's nice, Mark.

133
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,170
But I have to remind
you that I'm a supervisor,

134
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,550
not a friend.

135
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,740
Three new friends.

136
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,250
Okay.

137
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,210
Congratulations to our
two marks. And now...

138
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,366
What's your perpetuity wing like?

139
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:35,520
- Do the eagans move?
- No.

140
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,876
Probably because it's an older branch.

141
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,456
Ours were animatronic.

142
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,506
They even did this little
choreographed dance.

143
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,716
So yours just stand there? That's weird.

144
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:48,966
In my first perpetuity wing,
the eagans were brooms.

145
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,080
Brooms?

146
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,886
- Each with a face made of a plate.
- A plate?

147
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:53,950
We were very poor.

148
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,396
Did you guys have the cpr dummies?

149
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,936
- Yeah.
- What were those made of?

150
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,146
- Brooms.
- Did you have an elevator?

151
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:04,436
We had... how do you say a rope.

152
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,630
Jesus.

153
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:24,046
I'm heading out. You good?

154
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:26,796
Yep. Just about to close out.

155
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,110
Good. Thank you.

156
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,830
You know, my old team
was a bunch of dirt bags.

157
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:39,210
We never hit quota. Not once.

158
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:45,340
But it seems like you really liked yours.

159
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,390
So, I'm sorry.

160
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,270
Good night, Mark.

161
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,900
Good night.

162
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:38,366
Hey, everybody.

163
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,520
"Dear outie,

164
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:43,786
I don't know if this will reach
you, but I'm writing to alert you

165
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,086
of the heinous conditions
in the severed office

166
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:48,070
to which you have transferred me.

167
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:53,870
"The branch is run by a shambolic
rube who goes by milkshake."

168
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,556
My god.

169
00:15:55,580 --> 00:16:00,710
"A man whose stupidity is rivaled
only by that of the nine core principles."

170
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:05,566
If you must continue to send me here,
please consider strapping a bomb to me,

171
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:11,130
so that I may explode both milkshake
and the very spirit of kier eagan.

172
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,510
"Wrathfully, your innie, Mark w."

173
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:20,140
My god. That's very serious.

174
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,480
Is it earnest?

175
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,780
Do you really think
I'm a shambolic rube?

176
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,950
Wait, you think I wrote this note?

177
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:40,516
Were you going to frame
all of us or just Mark w.?

178
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:44,170
Clever way to secure the
name for yourself, I suppose?

179
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:48,976
- I don't know why you hate this team.
- I don't hate this team.

180
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,590
You didn't even disguise
your own handwriting.

181
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,350
You know what? I don't
even know who this team is.

182
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,810
I told you. I want my team.

183
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,480
Which part of that don't you understand?

184
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:16,006
Mark s., at this time, I revoke
your status as department chief,

185
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:19,990
which will be transferred to
your intended victim, Mark w.

186
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,266
I accept.

187
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:26,226
You will be relegated to the office

188
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,250
and must check in
regularly as to your progress.

189
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:35,430
Do you even have a
brother-in-law, asshole?

190
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,100
What's funny?

191
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,060
You don't know what I did
to the kitchenette yet, do you?

192
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:03,370
Goddamn it.

193
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,250
Hey!

194
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,720
You're definitely not supposed to do that.

195
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:24,076
Mr. Milchick, I've got
Mark s. In your office.

196
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,350
He's got the speaker.

197
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:31,860
Hello? Is anyone there? Is the board on?
It's Mark s. From macro data refinement.

198
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,006
Okay. Well, if you're there, please listen.

199
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:39,756
Now, I know that you want to do
the right thing for severed people,

200
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,676
- which is why I need to see my team again.
- Mark!

201
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,886
If we truly are the face of
severance reform, as you say,

202
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:48,976
- then they deserve a chance.
- Mark!

203
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,476
Please. They're my friends!

204
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,840
You can't just make
them disappear! Please!

205
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,046
Look, Mr. Milchick, I only went
to the board because I cannot

206
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:17,070
the board does not converse with innies.

207
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:22,596
It is clear your outie's fame
has gone to your innie's head.

208
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:27,660
No, my innie just wants his coworkers
back so we can serve kier together.

209
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,640
Are you firing me?

210
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:43,850
On you go.

211
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,770
Why can't you just bring them back?

212
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,570
Goodbye, Mark s.

213
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:57,860
Wait!

214
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,136
- Dylan!
- Mark.

215
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,226
- Did it work?
- It worked.

216
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,830
- Where are the others?
- I don't know.

217
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,686
Milchick was... I didn't
think I was coming back.

218
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:58,646
- I've been back a couple days already.
- What?

219
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:00,606
Yeah. And they had a whole new team.

220
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:02,276
- Cobel just replaced us?
- No.

221
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,026
Cobel's gone. Milchick's in charge.

222
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:07,526
Okay, so the man who just tackled me
and cut up my best belt is our boss now?

223
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:09,116
- Fuck me.
- Wait. He tackled you?

224
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,456
Yeah, bad. Which... I mean,
fair, I tackled the man first,

225
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,206
but I didn't fuck with his belt.

226
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,350
"Kier pardons his betrayers"?

227
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,940
Burt!

228
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,660
Dude, are you okay?

229
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:46,696
Irving, what happened?

230
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,600
The fuck? Irv! Dude, what's
wrong? You poor up there?

231
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:56,480
Come on.

232
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,176
Helly!

233
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,780
My god. Are you okay?

234
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,966
I'm okay. Did you wake up?

235
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:11,966
- Yeah, it was crazy.
- Same.

236
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,516
My god. I was so worried about you.

237
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,186
- How long has it been?
- Five months, maybe more.

238
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,370
Where's everybody else?

239
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,880
Come on.

240
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:23,760
They're gone.

241
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,430
Irving?

242
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:29,890
He won't come out.

243
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,156
- Hey, Irv?
- I'm sorry, Mark.

244
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:36,520
I just need a moment, please.

245
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,600
Okay. Take your time.

246
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:41,876
Okay, so what is going
on? We're not in trouble?

247
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,126
I don't think so. I mean,
milchick said our message got out.

248
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:45,666
He said we're famous.

249
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:47,716
All of us equally or one
of us is, like, the star?

250
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:50,716
I don't know. But then
he tried to fire me, I think.

251
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,056
Why?

252
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,426
Well, because I sort of
sabotaged the new people.

253
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:58,596
- New people?
- So, what the fuck happened up there?

254
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,646
Well, look, milchick is probably coming.

255
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:03,276
Good. I owe him a fucking
belt cut. Now tell me.

256
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,526
What if they're waiting for us
to tell each other what happened

257
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,356
because they don't
know what happened?

258
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,446
I mean, what if they're listening, Dylan?

259
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:11,190
Wait, what happened
to the security camera?

260
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:14,470
I

261
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,350
I'm sorry, I was...

262
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:20,400
Just

263
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:24,980
are you okay?

264
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,990
Hi, everyone. I'm miss huang.

265
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,780
Mr. Milchick's waiting
for you in the break room.

266
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:43,606
What the fuck is going
on? Why is she, like, eight?

267
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,800
I don't know.

268
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:46,896
Wait, so they replaced us?

269
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,066
For a couple days.

270
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:49,146
Who was me?

271
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:51,316
They weren't, like, specific counterparts.

272
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,736
They were, I don't know, weird.

273
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,616
Okay. Well, I don't think
you should feel bad at all.

274
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,496
- Feel bad?
- Yeah, for ending their lives. Fuck 'em.

275
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,036
Well, I wasn't trying to

276
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,706
no, dude, I'm saying don't feel bad.

277
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:03,230
Like, I'm sure they deserved it.

278
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,320
Macrodata refinement. Welcome back.

279
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,280
Please, take a seat.

280
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:40,200
Irving, if you wouldn't mind being in back.

281
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,750
Tall glass of water.

282
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,880
I guess the board
reconsidered my terms.

283
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:50,550
Guess so.

284
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,366
What you're about to see will be
shown to every innie who sets foot

285
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,220
in this building after today.

286
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:04,020
I hope it will give you a
sense of lumon's feelings.

287
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:26,226
<i>Hi. You probably don't
recognize me from this angle.</i>

288
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:29,976
<i>I'm the lumon administrative
building, branch 501.</i>

289
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,776
<i>And you're sitting in me right now.</i>

290
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,406
<i>The name's a mouthful,
or as I say, a "doorful."</i>

291
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:38,890
<i>So you can just call me lumon.</i>

292
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:44,866
<i>I've gone through a lot of changes
since my siring here in 1870.</i>

293
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:49,036
<i>But one thing I've always
had is a love for my workers,</i>

294
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:52,456
<i>both unsevered and severed.</i>

295
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,796
<i>Not to brag,</i>

296
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:57,546
<i>but my basement floor is one of
the premier severed workspaces</i>

297
00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:01,716
<i>in the 206 countries from
which lumon operates.</i>

298
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:04,580
<i>Hey, no running in my halls!</i>

299
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:07,410
<i>That tickles.</i>

300
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:14,880
<i>But what makes a building truly happy?</i>

301
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:19,486
<i>This question came to
light when four mdr workers,</i>

302
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:21,526
<i>dissatisfied with their severed lives,</i>

303
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:25,746
<i>conspired to mount what
lumon historians will forever call</i>

304
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:28,020
<i>the macrodat uprising.</i>

305
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:35,030
<i>Under my literal nose unfolded a
human drama of danger and intrigue.</i>

306
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,780
<i>Righteous anger.</i>

307
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,700
<i>Let's burn this place to the ground.</i>

308
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,000
<i>Inspiration.</i>

309
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:53,090
<i>Why are we down here
still working in the dark?</i>

310
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:57,630
<i>And love.</i>

311
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:02,680
What the shit?

312
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:09,810
<i>The macrodat uprising
yielded bounteous reforms.</i>

313
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:15,586
<i>These include tasty new
snacks, like fruit leather, cut beans,</i>

314
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:18,570
<i>Christmas mints, and salsa.</i>

315
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:27,016
Wh... <i>not sold yet?</i>

316
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,766
<i>The incentives were also reformed</i>

317
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:34,920
<i>and now range from hall
passes to pineapple bobbing...</i>

318
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,550
<i>To our brand-new playful mirror room.</i>

319
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:51,996
<i>You know, it's funny. I've sat by
this reflective pool my whole life,</i>

320
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:58,860
<i>yet it took the quiet courage of four
mdr heroes to show me who I really am.</i>

321
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:02,296
<i>They made quite a splash.</i>

322
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:07,870
<i>They sure did, water tower.
And I thank kier for them.</i>

323
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:13,620
<i>I thank kier for the macrodat uprising.</i>

324
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:33,230
I know we have our differences...

325
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:39,730
But I want you to know that I truly
respect each and every one of you.

326
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,650
And I don't wanna be your jailer.

327
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:51,136
By end of day, each of you will
choose whether you want to remain here.

328
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:54,000
Not your outies, but you.

329
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:57,976
If you start work on your file,
I'll assume you want to stay.

330
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,710
If not, I'll send you to
the surface. No ill will.

331
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,470
Maybe I'll even buy you
a drink at a bistro one day.

332
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,946
Like the rest of the severed floor,

333
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:14,640
the break room has no
cameras or microphones.

334
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:19,036
Privacy shouldn't mean
packing into a supply closet

335
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,690
like so many sardines.

336
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:30,620
I truly hope you all will choose to
stay and enjoy what you've helped build.

337
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,910
A new quarter. A fresh start.

338
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:37,670
For all of us.

339
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,287
What the hell was that?

340
00:30:53,311 --> 00:30:55,430
Massive-ass head
game is what that was.

341
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,440
So what the hell did
you guys see up there?

342
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:03,256
Well... He said there were
no microphones in here.

343
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,716
Yeah, he says a lot of shit,
so just fucking whisper it.

344
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:06,876
Okay.

345
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:12,176
So, I was at a party at my
sister's house for ricken hale.

346
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,290
Wait, what?

347
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,096
You know ricken hale?

348
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,186
He's my outie's brother-in-law.

349
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:18,646
What?

350
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:22,920
And for some reason,
we both know cobel.

351
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,840
That's insane.

352
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,720
Yeah. Well, there's something else.

353
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:32,946
Just before I switched back,
I found a wedding photo.

354
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:36,706
Now, I guess my outie's
wife died a few years ago.

355
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,286
Shit.

356
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:40,996
Which, apparently, is part of
why I decided to get severed.

357
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,110
Except...

358
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:50,700
The woman in the photo was Ms. Casey.

359
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,476
Ms. Casey is your wife?

360
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,886
Is my outie's wife.

361
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:00,476
But she's dead.

362
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,960
No, I know, but it was her.

363
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:08,720
Then she's down here.

364
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:13,010
No. I went to wellness. It's gone.

365
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,946
What do you mean, gone?

366
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:17,680
I mean, it's gone.

367
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,150
My god. Mark, are you okay?

368
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:25,940
Yeah. Well, I don't know.

369
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,280
What about you? What did you see?

370
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:37,096
I saw the inside

371
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,830
of a really fucking boring apartment.

372
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,460
So, you live by yourself?

373
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,540
Yeah.

374
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:51,510
I was watching some nature show on
TV, wearing sweatpants and a t-shirt.

375
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:56,486
What kind of t-shirt? Did it
feature, like, a band or pocket?

376
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:58,770
It was like a "save the gorillas" shirt.

377
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:00,826
Cool.

378
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:02,060
I guess.

379
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,310
And then what?

380
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:10,400
Then I went outside and found
a guy. He looked like a gardener.

381
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,716
Told him everything. I think
he kind of thought it was bullshit.

382
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,966
But he said that his brother was a cop

383
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:18,370
and that he would tell him everything.

384
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:25,330
I don't know. Sorry, guys. I really tried.

385
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,130
A gardener?

386
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,430
Yeah.

387
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,590
A night gardener?

388
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:40,310
I think so. I mean, maybe he
has a different job during the day.

389
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,060
What about you, Irv?

390
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,150
Do you suppose he's serious?

391
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,950
About letting us leave?

392
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,210
Irv, what did you see?

393
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,710
It's not our world up there.

394
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,260
That's what I saw.

395
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,720
Come on, man.

396
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:19,760
You can tell us.

397
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,940
Yeah, it's okay.

398
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,770
Even if it's bad.

399
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:04,827
Irv.

400
00:35:04,851 --> 00:35:07,440
I just wanna walk for a bit.

401
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,036
- I'll talk to him.
- No, no. We should all go.

402
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,296
No. He's fine, okay?

403
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,296
Let me talk him down. You go
back to camp. I'll get you if I need you.

404
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,570
- Are you sure? You...
- but...

405
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,000
Hey, Irv's gonna be okay, right?

406
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:34,050
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

407
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,920
Dylan's on it.

408
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,946
And we have till the end of the day.

409
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:41,050
Yeah.

410
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:52,310
Did you guys look happy
in the wedding photo?

411
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,480
Yeah, we did.

412
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:04,660
You know, I never, like... Ms.
Casey and I never felt that way.

413
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:07,580
Okay.

414
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:11,710
So, what are you gonna do?

415
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,630
Well.

416
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,130
I gotta get her out of here.

417
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:24,390
Right? I mean, if she's my wife...

418
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,890
Right. Of course. I mean,
assuming she's still here.

419
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,520
Though technically, strictly
speaking, she's not your wife.

420
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:37,480
I'm pretty sure your outie bought the ring.

421
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:39,610
Sure.

422
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:44,530
Except, you know, we're
the same-ish person.

423
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:48,660
So, it's mushy.

424
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,226
It's mushy?

425
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,976
- Is that what it is? Mushy? Okay.
- It's... yeah. Listen, helly

426
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,170
we're not the same, actually.

427
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,220
Us and the outies, we're not.

428
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:04,890
And speaking for myself, I
don't think we owe them shit.

429
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:10,140
But Ms. Casey is

430
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:12,980
well, she's one of us.

431
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,480
So, if you wanna help your outie
and find out what happened to her.

432
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:22,950
I'll help.

433
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:28,120
So you're staying?

434
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,120
I think I'm staying.

435
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:49,696
- Irv. Hold up.
- Leave me alone, Dylan.

436
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:54,520
Oka... dude. Is it... you can't
leave until the end of the day.

437
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,046
Are you sure?

438
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:59,150
Irv.

439
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,690
I failed at the objective.

440
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,360
What?

441
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,820
I went to go find Burt.

442
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:09,830
Okay. Did you see him?

443
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:16,960
He's married, or, at
least, he's with someone.

444
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:20,630
I saw them through the window.

445
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:22,210
Shit.

446
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:25,720
I should be happy he's happy.

447
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:31,970
Yeah. But seems like
you're probably not, right?

448
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:37,270
The last time I was happy
was when all I knew was mdr.

449
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,820
When I was good at my job

450
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,730
and not trying to be happy.

451
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:46,126
I'm going to leave, Dylan.

452
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:48,676
It is not leaving. So
stop fucking calling it that.

453
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,740
- I know, you want... I know...
- just fucking try.

454
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:02,500
You're a good friend, Dylan.

455
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:13,786
Before I went to Burt's, I
woke up in my apartment.

456
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:14,980
What?

457
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:19,496
I was standing in front
of some kind of easel.

458
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,416
Fuck. There's easels up there?

459
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:26,796
Yeah. My outie was working on a
painting of a hallway. A black hallway.

460
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,136
Like the break room one?

461
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,030
No, it was different. Darker.

462
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:34,160
There was an elevator at the
end with a downward arrow.

463
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:36,306
He painted dozens of them.

464
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:37,227
Fuck. Why?

465
00:39:37,251 --> 00:39:42,396
I don't know. And I wanted
you to know before I left.

466
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,066
Okay. Well, you're not. You... no.

467
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,816
Stop it. Listen to me.

468
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:50,986
Look, I'm sorry that outie Burt
has a hot husband or whatever.

469
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:54,406
But he is not the point. Innie
Burt is the guy you fell for,

470
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:56,730
and I know because I
encouraged the courtship.

471
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,060
I

472
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,876
I want it to be over.

473
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:06,796
Okay. So then after you
find the black hallway or

474
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:09,700
I want the pain to be over.

475
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:15,516
If he's gone and I'm
gone... Stop saying that.

476
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,476
Then somehow, we'll be together.

477
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,636
He wouldn't want that.

478
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:19,750
How do you know?

479
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,000
Because I don't want that.

480
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:28,760
Because I would be sad,

481
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:31,866
and I would be less productive,

482
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:35,326
and I'm really good at
what I do here, whatever it is.

483
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:39,100
And you're part of what makes
me good at it. So please, do not go.

484
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:45,980
Dylan.

485
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:55,120
I'm your favorite perk.

486
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,620
Don't bring them into this.

487
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:02,266
All I'm saying is, if Burt was still here,

488
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:06,040
he would be telling you to stick around
and figure out what the fuck this is.

489
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:08,710
Dylan g.

490
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,680
Mr. Milchick would like to see you.

491
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,520
Right.

492
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:56,760
I know, but they said it
would be corrected by now.

493
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,720
It should be Mr. Milchick.

494
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:06,190
M-r-period-space-m-i-l-c-h-i-c-k.

495
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,956
- Well, I sympathize...
- Mr. Milchick,

496
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:14,400
but could you please see that
it's taken care of? Yes. Thank you.

497
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,546
If someone calls about
my welcome screen,

498
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:19,256
I need you to put that
call through immediately.

499
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,370
Yes, sir.

500
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:23,370
You wanted to see me?

501
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:26,290
I did.

502
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,090
Thank you, miss huang.

503
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:40,140
You gonna apologize about the belt?

504
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:51,480
Your wife's name is Gretchen.

505
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:56,610
What?

506
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:59,240
She wanted you to know.

507
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:01,830
Come with me.

508
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:17,010
And I do apologize, Dylan,
for not being a better listener.

509
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:20,050
For not hearing your needs.

510
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:26,140
Take a look.

511
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:33,006
These are blueprints
for a new renovation,

512
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:35,610
of which I chose not to
inform your colleagues.

513
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:39,870
It's called the outie
family visitation suite.

514
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,660
Are you saying I could
see my family here?

515
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:53,090
If you take the name of the
room at face value, I'd say yes.

516
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:57,380
Holy fuck.

517
00:43:58,300 --> 00:43:59,430
The holiest.

518
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,470
Sadly, everyone else in
your department is single.

519
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:07,326
As such, I'm asking that
you keep this between us...

520
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:10,600
- Are you...
- Only to avoid resentment.

521
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,900
I'd hate for your friends to turn against
you after all you've done for them.

522
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,410
You okay?

523
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:49,726
I'm okay.

524
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:50,830
Where's Irv?

525
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:55,750
Right here.

526
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:06,800
Irv. You okay?

527
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:09,520
I'm okay.
