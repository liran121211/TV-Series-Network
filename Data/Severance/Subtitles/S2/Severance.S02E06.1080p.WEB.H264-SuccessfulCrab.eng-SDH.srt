1
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:14,348
There was... [stammers] ...this gray hall,
but then... [stammers]

2
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:19,394
...everything was, like, so white.

3
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:22,940
We're making progress.

4
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:25,710
It's not just waking up on a table.

5
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:27,611
It's human interaction.

6
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:31,341
This didn't feel human,
this felt like a nightmare.

7
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:34,368
I mean, why is she
rattling off a bunch of facts?

8
00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:37,621
[stammers] What are they doing to her?

9
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,832
All I know is she's essential.

10
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:46,922
She didn't even recognize me.

11
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:52,845
The Gemma you know is still in there.

12
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:58,684
And when you get her out, it will be
the two of you out here together.

13
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,566
[slurps, sighs]

14
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:13,574
Bargaining.

15
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:16,034
You know what that is?

16
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:18,161
What do you mean?

17
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:22,332
Well, it's one of the stages.

18
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:28,898
You think about all the things you'd do,

19
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:34,970
and all the ways you'd change
to get that person back.

20
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:43,228
You'd drink less. You'd listen more.

21
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,878
It's dumb, but you do it anyway.

22
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:51,004
[Reghabi] It's normal.

23
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:52,112
Yeah.

24
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,242
But for me, it might actually happen.

25
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:07,395
[Dylan] <i>It was a sketch
of a black hallway,</i>

26
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:09,880
with a black elevator that only goes down.

27
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,112
So there's a floor beneath us.

28
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,822
That must be where they're keeping her.

29
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,890
There were directions on the back.

30
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:21,642
Well, let's see it.

31
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,229
I left it there, behind the poster.

32
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,041
Why didn't you just take it?

33
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:29,626
I just didn't, okay?

34
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,169
I don't wanna get in trouble right now.

35
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:33,379
Okay. Well, I don't give a shit
about that, so I'll go get it.

36
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,548
You said it's behind the poster
of you actually being brave?

37
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,592
Okay, yeah. Fuck you.
You don't know everything.

38
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:38,992
Then tell us.

39
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,162
It's okay.

40
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:45,415
[sighs]

41
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:54,359
Okay. Well, I still have a hall pass,
so I can go to the break room now,

42
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:56,236
- and then we can start after lunch.
- Yeah. Maybe.

43
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,445
Maybe?

44
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:59,906
Did everyone sever their balls
in the elevator this morning?

45
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,306
I'm starving.

46
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:03,851
[sighs]

47
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,329
[birds chirping]

48
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:26,999
[Helly] Mark?

49
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:29,668
Are you okay?

50
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,254
[knocking]

51
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,304
[Miss Huang] Sir?

52
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:07,808
Have a seat.

53
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:17,609
I had my performance review yesterday.

54
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:21,947
How did it go?

55
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:34,168
Many valid concerns were raised,
which I look forward to addressing.

56
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:37,045
I'm glad for you.

57
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,056
I feel I should remind you,

58
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:50,118
you cannot graduate from this fellowship

59
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:53,270
until I have deemed you
Wintertide material.

60
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:02,821
This will mean using your time well,
focusing on your own duties,

61
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:06,825
and eradicating
from your essence childish folly.

62
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:13,165
I understand, sir.

63
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,794
I shall be busy for the rest of the day.

64
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:21,256
I trust you can steward
the floor in my stead?

65
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,569
- Of course.
- Good.

66
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:26,845
You may sit at your regular desk.

67
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:34,144
Thank you, Mr. Milchick.

68
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:42,152
[door opens, closes]

69
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:51,095
- [Helly] <i>He threatened you?</i>
- [Mark] <i>As I was leaving.</i>

70
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,263
In the elevator.

71
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:53,973
They're trying to intimidate us.

72
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,725
- Divide us.
- And also--

73
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,352
It's so that we won't work together,

74
00:06:57,376 --> 00:06:59,896
because they know what will happen
if we do. I'm gonna go get that map.

75
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,672
Helly, we shared vessels.

76
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:04,216
What's that?

77
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:08,512
Well, we...

78
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:14,476
we had, uh, sex.

79
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:17,771
Okay.

80
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:24,945
Y-You and... [chuckles] Like...
Like, in a Wellness session?

81
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:28,883
No. Not... [stammers] ...Ms. Casey.

82
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:32,679
It was, uh, at the retreat.

83
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:36,832
[stammers] In your tent.

84
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,088
- Oh.
- Yeah.

85
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:46,592
Oh.

86
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:50,053
You mean...

87
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,869
I mean, obviously, you know,
I thought it was you.

88
00:07:55,893 --> 00:08:02,417
Uh, 'cause, you know,
I've been having those feelings since,

89
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:04,711
like, before the OTC.

90
00:08:04,735 --> 00:08:09,239
So when she... [stammers]
I just... I... I had no idea, okay?

91
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:13,469
- Uh-huh.
- I'm... I'm sorry, Helly.

92
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,971
I, uh... She tricked me.

93
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,806
I mean, I... [stammers]
...you know, wanted to, but she...

94
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,875
she tricked b-both of us.

95
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:28,050
It's probably another tactic.

96
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:31,237
Something to drive a wedge between us.

97
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:32,822
- Like--
- Helly--

98
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,640
I'm gonna go for a walk.

99
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:40,729
[Mark] Helly, I'm sorry.
I thought it was you.

100
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,688
[Helly] But it wasn't me.

101
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:45,734
Yeah, I'm just gonna go walk around.

102
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:48,779
[door closes]

103
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:05,480
[Dylan] First date, let me guess.

104
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,585
- Scuba.
- [Gretchen] Thai food.

105
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:09,669
[Dylan] Nice.

106
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:12,005
[Gretchen] Though you did take
scuba lessons last year.

107
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:14,299
[Dylan] Yeah? Which sea?

108
00:10:14,323 --> 00:10:15,800
[Gretchen] It... It was in a pool.

109
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:17,868
[Dylan] Okay. Cool.

110
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,787
- [Gretchen] It was a little expensive.
- [Dylan] Oh.

111
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:24,976
You've had a lot of phases.

112
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,979
Scuba diving, woodworking.

113
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:30,190
Wow. So, my outie's really diverse.

114
00:10:30,214 --> 00:10:32,108
Garage beer-making.

115
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,300
[chuckles]

116
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:40,933
Maybe I'm trying to find something
I excel in up there, like I do down here.

117
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:47,105
I sometimes wonder
if you're just not happy.

118
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,526
I'm sure it's not that.

119
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:57,574
'Cause, like, you know... I mean,
here, with you, I'm super happy.

120
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:01,679
I just, like, wanna hear
about all my offspring

121
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:04,289
and stare at your face.

122
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:11,105
- Sorry. That was weird.
- [inhales sharply] No.

123
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:12,798
It was really sweet.

124
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:15,342
I like it.

125
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:17,886
I like this.

126
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,535
I wish we could really be together.

127
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:26,520
Like, all the time.

128
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:30,107
I mean, we are.

129
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:32,901
Aren't we?

130
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:36,613
You and him are.

131
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:39,616
But I'm not.

132
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:50,544
[sighs]

133
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:55,859
Is it okay if we try the hug again?

134
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:57,593
I kind of like the hugging.

135
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:17,738
[Dylan chuckles]

136
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:19,865
[Gretchen chuckles]

137
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,748
[Dylan breathes heavily]

138
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:00,906
[chuckles]

139
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,770
Oh, hey. I was coming to find you.

140
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:57,171
Same.

141
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:01,776
Look, I am so sorry.

142
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,279
I can't even imagine
what it must be like to--

143
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:05,721
You thought it was me.

144
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:08,449
Hundred percent.

145
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:09,993
Which means you wanted to.

146
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:11,351
With me.

147
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,105
Yeah.

148
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:19,318
What sucks is that she got
to have that, and I didn't.

149
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:25,341
That she used me to trick my friends.

150
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,844
Used my body to get close to you.

151
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:30,662
That she dresses me in
the morning like I'm a baby.

152
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:34,142
That she controls me,
and this company, and all of us.

153
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,542
It's disgusting.

154
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:44,635
[breathing shakily]

155
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:55,121
Hey, do you... do you want me to, like,
describe... [stammers] ...what happened?

156
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:56,748
Like, I feel like you
have every right to know.

157
00:14:56,772 --> 00:14:58,565
No, no, no. I don't want her memory.

158
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:00,400
Okay.

159
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,197
I want my own.

160
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,664
[stammers] Would you like that?

161
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:20,128
Yeah, I'd like that.

162
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,053
But how?

163
00:16:17,436 --> 00:16:19,730
Ta-da. A tent.

164
00:16:20,314 --> 00:16:21,315
[Mark chuckles]

165
00:16:48,634 --> 00:16:49,801
I'm nervous.

166
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:52,429
Me too.

167
00:16:54,223 --> 00:16:55,575
- You too.
- It's okay.

168
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:57,476
- Okay.
- [chuckles]

169
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:17,579
[both chuckle]

170
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:21,666
[Mark chuckles]

171
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:25,002
[kisses]

172
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,300
[kissing]

173
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:37,617
[Helly breathes heavily]

174
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:38,767
[kisses]

175
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:43,373
[Helly moans]

176
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:44,565
[Mark] Oh, wait.

177
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:55,576
[kisses]

178
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:01,582
Yes?

179
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:04,960
Yes.

180
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:19,766
[breathes deeply]

181
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:23,145
[moans]

182
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:27,524
[breathing shakily]

183
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:38,368
[exhales sharply]

184
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:04,394
[breathing deeply]

185
00:19:30,254 --> 00:19:34,675
You must eradicate from
your essence childish folly.

186
00:19:39,263 --> 00:19:44,059
You must eradicate from
yourself childish folly.

187
00:19:57,781 --> 00:20:00,367
You must abandon childish things.

188
00:20:03,954 --> 00:20:05,414
You must grow up.

189
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:10,085
You must grow up.

190
00:20:11,128 --> 00:20:12,379
Grow up.

191
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:14,798
Grow up.

192
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:18,218
Grow up.

193
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,638
Grow.

194
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:23,599
Grow.

195
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:25,851
Grow.

196
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:28,520
Grow.

197
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:32,191
Grow.

198
00:20:56,632 --> 00:20:58,258
Was it different with me?

199
00:21:06,725 --> 00:21:08,310
[kisses]

200
00:21:10,604 --> 00:21:12,356
Oh, no, you're bleeding.

201
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:17,194
No, you are.

202
00:21:23,742 --> 00:21:25,410
You have two minutes left.

203
00:21:26,828 --> 00:21:31,083
Humidity on the severed floor
is maintained at a consistent 45%.

204
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:33,770
It must be something else.

205
00:21:33,794 --> 00:21:35,980
[Mark clicks tongue] Oh. Oh.

206
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:37,214
Did you punch him?

207
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:40,819
[stammers] Uh, I mean, not today.

208
00:21:40,843 --> 00:21:43,637
What were you doing
when the nosebleed occurred?

209
00:21:44,972 --> 00:21:48,642
We were refining s... something.

210
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:51,812
Do you have a deviated septum?

211
00:21:52,604 --> 00:21:54,565
Well, I don't know what that is.

212
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:57,544
Would you like me to put
petroleum jelly in your nostrils?

213
00:21:57,568 --> 00:22:00,129
[sighs] Uh, no, thanks.

214
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:02,215
Any other symptoms?

215
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:04,950
Any auras or hallucinations?

216
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:10,414
No. I think it stopped. I feel better.

217
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:14,501
I'm going to take your blood pressure.

218
00:22:21,383 --> 00:22:22,986
[Reghabi] <i>Where are you?</i>

219
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:25,345
I'm at Lumon.

220
00:22:29,183 --> 00:22:31,143
- What?
- What?

221
00:22:35,814 --> 00:22:38,734
- Fuck. I was just--
- [Miss Huang] <i>Mark?</i>

222
00:22:40,819 --> 00:22:41,904
Wha--

223
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:43,923
Were you just at Lumon?

224
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:45,758
What time is it?

225
00:22:45,782 --> 00:22:47,844
Are you at Lumon
or in your basement with me?

226
00:22:47,868 --> 00:22:50,138
I... I... I don't know.

227
00:22:50,162 --> 00:22:51,389
Do you remember a hallway?

228
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:52,473
A black hallway?

229
00:22:52,497 --> 00:22:57,937
I remember, uh...
[stammers] I remember... Okay.

230
00:22:57,961 --> 00:22:59,505
I remember a desk.

231
00:23:00,214 --> 00:23:03,985
[stammers] I remember a desk.

232
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:09,574
I remember... I remember...
I remember... Shit.

233
00:23:09,598 --> 00:23:12,535
[coughing, breathing heavily]

234
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,478
That was another crossover memory.

235
00:23:15,187 --> 00:23:17,290
A recent one. That's good.

236
00:23:17,314 --> 00:23:20,168
You'll feel gaps in time
until it all comes back together.

237
00:23:20,192 --> 00:23:21,832
Well, when the fuck is that gonna happen?

238
00:23:25,322 --> 00:23:28,033
We need to enhance. Speed up the process.

239
00:23:29,326 --> 00:23:30,410
Is that safe?

240
00:23:31,954 --> 00:23:33,830
There's a slight chance of hemorrhage.

241
00:23:34,665 --> 00:23:37,084
Okay. So, me bleeding to death.

242
00:23:39,086 --> 00:23:40,546
[Reghabi] Not necessarily.

243
00:23:42,422 --> 00:23:44,424
We'll flood the chip itself.

244
00:23:44,967 --> 00:23:46,051
[Mark] Flood the chip?

245
00:23:46,844 --> 00:23:49,864
- [Reghabi] Through the hole in your head.
- Jesus Christ.

246
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:51,533
- [Reghabi] That you've already got.
- Okay--

247
00:23:51,557 --> 00:23:52,867
You know what?

248
00:23:52,891 --> 00:23:54,619
Get the fuck off me.

249
00:23:54,643 --> 00:23:56,663
- I am not doing this, okay?
- We're close. It's happening.

250
00:23:56,687 --> 00:23:58,873
- Get this shit off right now! Please.
- We need to push!

251
00:23:58,897 --> 00:24:00,375
Get it off--

252
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:02,919
- [groans]
- [sighs] God. I'm fu... I'm starving.

253
00:24:02,943 --> 00:24:04,587
That's also from reintegration.

254
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:06,196
Okay, you know what?

255
00:24:06,989 --> 00:24:08,532
I'm gonna go eat.

256
00:24:13,036 --> 00:24:14,037
Fuck.

257
00:24:47,112 --> 00:24:48,614
[door bell chimes]

258
00:24:53,243 --> 00:24:54,244
[Irving] Hello.

259
00:24:56,788 --> 00:24:58,123
Who the hell are you?

260
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:03,146
- [chuckles] It's a joke.
- Oh.

261
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:05,857
- Come on in. Hey.
- Oh. Okay.

262
00:25:05,881 --> 00:25:07,466
- What the heck?
- [Irving stammers]

263
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:13,740
Fields is tending the ham.

264
00:25:13,764 --> 00:25:15,742
I hope you like a cumin glaze.

265
00:25:15,766 --> 00:25:18,161
Oh. Ye... Yes, of course.

266
00:25:18,185 --> 00:25:20,121
- Do you not?
- No, I do.

267
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:21,289
[Fields] Attila.

268
00:25:21,313 --> 00:25:22,832
Yes, Attila?

269
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:24,876
[Fields] Did you just ask about the glaze?

270
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,902
- [Burt] I did.
- [Fields] Well, don't.

271
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:28,820
I've already put it on.

272
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:32,258
I was gonna say w... we also have corn.

273
00:25:32,282 --> 00:25:34,302
Oh, yes.

274
00:25:34,326 --> 00:25:38,872
We could feed him
a pile of loose corn. [chuckles]

275
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:40,892
Oh.

276
00:25:40,916 --> 00:25:45,420
What your innie ever saw
in this Philistine

277
00:25:46,463 --> 00:25:48,090
is beyond me.

278
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:51,653
Fields, I presume.

279
00:25:51,677 --> 00:25:52,779
Yes.

280
00:25:52,803 --> 00:25:54,179
- Irving.
- Irving.

281
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:55,698
Yes.

282
00:25:55,722 --> 00:25:57,575
Welcome back to our home.

283
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:01,496
Yes. I'm sorry about the last time.

284
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:05,148
I'm sure that felt quite invasive.

285
00:26:06,066 --> 00:26:07,484
Nonsense.

286
00:26:08,235 --> 00:26:09,945
What's mine's yours.

287
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:13,866
And you've brought wine.

288
00:26:17,286 --> 00:26:22,225
Irving, no one's ever thrown blood
on you on your way into work?

289
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:25,145
- No.
- It wasn't blood. It was paint.

290
00:26:25,169 --> 00:26:26,729
[Burt] Meant to evoke blood.

291
00:26:26,753 --> 00:26:27,856
Not what you said.

292
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:32,026
The Whole Mind people
are off the deep end, is my point.

293
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:35,220
And, Burt, how di... how did
you come to be at the company?

294
00:26:36,263 --> 00:26:38,432
- [Burt] Me?
- [Irving] Yes, I'm very curious.

295
00:26:38,932 --> 00:26:43,979
Well, as a matter of fact,
I was guided to Lumon's door by Jesus.

296
00:26:45,856 --> 00:26:46,857
Oh.

297
00:26:47,858 --> 00:26:50,444
Jesus Christ?

298
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:52,905
That's the one. [laughs]

299
00:26:54,948 --> 00:26:58,136
You should just leave it at that, and
let him wonder what the hell you meant.

300
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:01,955
No, we'd been attending
the Lutheran church for some years.

301
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:06,895
And I should mention that I'd been
what you might call a scoundrel...

302
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:08,646
- [Fields chuckles]
- ...in my younger days.

303
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:11,191
To put it mildly. [chuckles]

304
00:27:11,215 --> 00:27:14,903
So, one Sunday at breakfast,
Fields asked me point blank,

305
00:27:14,927 --> 00:27:16,720
do I think I'm going to heaven?

306
00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:20,599
Hmm. As one asks at breakfast.

307
00:27:21,225 --> 00:27:27,373
I pretend to think about it,
but I know the answer is no.

308
00:27:27,397 --> 00:27:32,528
To which I replied, "What am I supposed to
do up there for eternity all by myself?"

309
00:27:33,362 --> 00:27:36,466
- I see.
- So we hop on the train to church,

310
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:40,011
and it so happens the sermon that day
is about severance...

311
00:27:40,035 --> 00:27:43,056
- [Fields] Uh. Yeah.
- ...which was still very new at the time.

312
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,641
And the pastor says--

313
00:27:44,665 --> 00:27:48,210
As if he'd been listening
to our conversation,

314
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:53,817
he said the church's stance
is that innies are, you know,

315
00:27:53,841 --> 00:27:59,137
complete individuals, with souls...

316
00:28:01,139 --> 00:28:05,227
that can be judged
separately from their outie.

317
00:28:07,771 --> 00:28:11,125
So, an innie can go to heaven.

318
00:28:11,149 --> 00:28:13,235
Whilst the outie burns.

319
00:28:16,446 --> 00:28:18,240
[Fields] We're not zealots, I swear.

320
00:28:18,991 --> 00:28:22,428
But we... we figured that if it were true,

321
00:28:22,452 --> 00:28:26,748
it may be a way for part of Burt to--

322
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:30,085
Oh, you know...

323
00:28:34,923 --> 00:28:35,966
Wow.

324
00:28:38,135 --> 00:28:41,263
- He's looking for the exit. [chuckles]
- No, it's... it's just, uh--

325
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:48,121
So, the hope was for Burt's
innie to go to heaven.

326
00:28:48,145 --> 00:28:51,565
Yes. With me.

327
00:28:56,236 --> 00:28:57,237
[Irving] Hmm.

328
00:29:32,481 --> 00:29:33,774
[Merrick babbles]

329
00:29:35,025 --> 00:29:36,878
[Dylan] Gretch, it's the end of the month.

330
00:29:36,902 --> 00:29:40,298
Those salesmen are just dying to hit
their numbers and get cars off the lot.

331
00:29:40,322 --> 00:29:42,449
They'll basically be giving me money.

332
00:29:45,869 --> 00:29:46,846
[Gretchen] Mmm.

333
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:49,098
[sighs] Okay. Fine.

334
00:29:49,122 --> 00:29:50,934
Just test drive only.

335
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:53,061
I won't commit to anything.

336
00:29:53,085 --> 00:29:58,131
- [babbling] No. No.
- Thank you.

337
00:29:58,924 --> 00:30:01,653
You didn't tell me how'd it go.
You went back to Lumon, right?

338
00:30:01,677 --> 00:30:02,886
[Merrick babbling]

339
00:30:03,804 --> 00:30:06,574
- Oh. [sighs] Um...
- [Merrick] No.

340
00:30:06,598 --> 00:30:08,767
- [babbles]
- That good?

341
00:30:11,728 --> 00:30:12,813
They canceled it.

342
00:30:13,647 --> 00:30:15,566
I didn't see him... you.

343
00:30:16,483 --> 00:30:18,127
- Happy plate. Happy plate.
- Happy plate.

344
00:30:18,151 --> 00:30:19,462
Go play with your sister.

345
00:30:19,486 --> 00:30:21,130
- [clears throat]
- Canceled it? What happened?

346
00:30:21,154 --> 00:30:22,215
[Merrick moans]

347
00:30:22,239 --> 00:30:25,993
[clicks tongue] They didn't say.
Guess you got too busy.

348
00:30:28,787 --> 00:30:33,000
- Hey. Buddy. Try it. No. Okay.
- Oh. Mm-mmm. No.

349
00:31:02,112 --> 00:31:03,113
Thank you.

350
00:31:44,446 --> 00:31:48,033
Mark Scout.

351
00:31:49,826 --> 00:31:52,847
Thought that was you.
I'm Helena Eagan. I work at Lumon.

352
00:31:52,871 --> 00:31:55,415
Yeah. No, I... I... I...
I know who you are.

353
00:31:59,044 --> 00:32:00,604
Well, it's nice to officially meet you.

354
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:10,305
Have you had enough to eat?

355
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,601
Uh, yeah, quite possibly.

356
00:32:16,186 --> 00:32:18,206
I hope they're feeding you at work.

357
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,314
May I?

358
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:22,651
Please.

359
00:32:27,698 --> 00:32:30,009
[chuckles] It's really great
to run into you.

360
00:32:30,033 --> 00:32:32,512
I've heard nothing but good things
about your work, by the way.

361
00:32:32,536 --> 00:32:35,622
Thank you. I've heard nothing at all
about my work, so...

362
00:32:36,748 --> 00:32:38,977
- Severance humor. That's so clever.
- Hmm.

363
00:32:39,001 --> 00:32:40,252
And so easy.

364
00:32:43,297 --> 00:32:49,136
Look, I'm sorry for the systemic error
from the other night.

365
00:32:49,803 --> 00:32:51,072
The systemic error?

366
00:32:51,096 --> 00:32:54,266
You mean the... the overtime thing?

367
00:32:55,184 --> 00:32:58,687
- Yes. The OTC. [clears throat]
- Oh.

368
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,901
It never should have happened,
and it... and it never will again.

369
00:33:04,484 --> 00:33:10,466
We take pride as a company to be better
than that, and we will be better.

370
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:13,243
- Well, that's nice to hear. Thanks.
- Of course.

371
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,584
So, you know all about it then.

372
00:33:21,084 --> 00:33:22,961
Yes, I know all about it.

373
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,174
I'm, like, the head of the company, Mark.

374
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:32,947
Right. [stammers] Dumb. Sorry.

375
00:33:32,971 --> 00:33:34,115
Yeah, you should be sorry.

376
00:33:34,139 --> 00:33:36,367
- Really? Okay.
- I'm kidding.

377
00:33:36,391 --> 00:33:38,203
You're clearly not dumb.

378
00:33:38,227 --> 00:33:39,913
I don't know. You...

379
00:33:39,937 --> 00:33:42,790
You're the one who invented
a revolutionary medical procedure.

380
00:33:42,814 --> 00:33:44,709
Hey, now, that was... that was not me.

381
00:33:44,733 --> 00:33:45,793
That was my father.

382
00:33:45,817 --> 00:33:46,902
Uh-huh.

383
00:33:48,904 --> 00:33:50,239
You should meet him sometime.

384
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,051
Your father?

385
00:33:53,075 --> 00:33:54,135
Sure. Why not?

386
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,245
You wanna take me home to Dad already?

387
00:33:57,079 --> 00:33:58,556
Yeah, I think it's finally time.

388
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,624
Okay. Sure. Let's do it.

389
00:34:02,209 --> 00:34:03,293
You'd be the first.

390
00:34:03,877 --> 00:34:07,422
- Oh. So, no pressure.
- Yeah. None whatsoever.

391
00:34:11,092 --> 00:34:12,719
[both chuckle]

392
00:34:13,387 --> 00:34:16,407
But seriously, I'd love to hear
about your experiences sometime.

393
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:18,016
Okay. Yeah.

394
00:34:19,476 --> 00:34:20,452
About severance?

395
00:34:20,476 --> 00:34:24,707
I... I meant the overtime con...
I meant the other night.

396
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:25,815
[clears throat]

397
00:34:26,525 --> 00:34:30,505
I mean, I can't imagine how confusing
that must have been.

398
00:34:30,529 --> 00:34:31,989
Traumatic, even.

399
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:38,495
And I know you've already been through
so much with losing your wife and all.

400
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:41,748
Hanna.

401
00:34:46,295 --> 00:34:47,295
Gemma.

402
00:34:49,005 --> 00:34:52,092
Right. Gemma. Sorry.

403
00:34:54,428 --> 00:34:56,346
It was a car accident, right?

404
00:34:57,890 --> 00:34:58,891
That's right.

405
00:35:00,893 --> 00:35:02,394
Yeah, such a shame.

406
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:05,981
She was so young.

407
00:35:11,528 --> 00:35:12,529
Thank you.

408
00:35:19,578 --> 00:35:22,932
[coughing]

409
00:35:22,956 --> 00:35:24,541
Are you all right?

410
00:35:25,501 --> 00:35:27,812
I'm fine. I'm just about finished here.

411
00:35:27,836 --> 00:35:29,546
Okay. Right.

412
00:35:32,799 --> 00:35:35,469
Well, it was nice to meet you, Helena.

413
00:35:36,053 --> 00:35:38,055
Yeah. You too, Mark.

414
00:35:52,194 --> 00:35:53,278
What is it?

415
00:35:56,406 --> 00:35:57,407
Nothing.

416
00:36:00,786 --> 00:36:03,080
Good night.

417
00:36:22,641 --> 00:36:24,476
[engine starts]

418
00:37:16,445 --> 00:37:18,590
We used to call each other hon,

419
00:37:18,614 --> 00:37:22,594
then about ten years ago
that became Attila.

420
00:37:22,618 --> 00:37:25,638
- [laughs]
- Because... Do you know history?

421
00:37:25,662 --> 00:37:28,474
- Yeah. [chuckles]
- He knows history.

422
00:37:28,498 --> 00:37:30,477
[laughs]

423
00:37:30,501 --> 00:37:32,937
And it wasn't ten years ago. It was 20.

424
00:37:32,961 --> 00:37:35,690
- No. No.
- Yes. Yes!

425
00:37:35,714 --> 00:37:42,614
Because I remember we were having drinks
with your Lumon partner.

426
00:37:42,638 --> 00:37:44,223
Quite startled him.

427
00:37:48,352 --> 00:37:51,915
Didn't the first severed office
open 12 years ago?

428
00:37:51,939 --> 00:37:53,649
- [Burt] Yes, it did.
- Yeah.

429
00:37:54,233 --> 00:37:58,654
[clicks tongue] Maybe
that's enough of that, hmm?

430
00:38:05,035 --> 00:38:06,370
[Fields swallows]

431
00:38:09,122 --> 00:38:12,185
[Irving] Mmm.
[clicks tongue, inhales sharply]

432
00:38:12,209 --> 00:38:15,462
You know the... the corn is very special.

433
00:38:16,171 --> 00:38:18,233
Do you think you two
ever made love at work?

434
00:38:18,257 --> 00:38:20,050
Fields, Jesus.

435
00:38:21,009 --> 00:38:24,805
Can we not just be
pragmatic adults about this?

436
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:33,856
There is a nonzero chance that
the two of you had unprotected sex.

437
00:38:35,774 --> 00:38:38,527
And so, I felt the right to ask.

438
00:38:42,531 --> 00:38:46,451
Are you done humiliating our guest?

439
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,849
[Fields] Sounds like I'm mad, but I'm not.

440
00:38:50,873 --> 00:38:52,749
Cards on the table.

441
00:38:53,876 --> 00:38:56,312
I've been talking to
Pastor Gale about this,

442
00:38:56,336 --> 00:39:03,010
and I... I believe that
innies deserve to experience love.

443
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:08,891
I mean it.

444
00:39:11,977 --> 00:39:14,188
And I hope it was beautiful.

445
00:39:30,287 --> 00:39:31,622
[panting]

446
00:39:33,999 --> 00:39:35,268
Sorry for being a dick.

447
00:39:35,292 --> 00:39:36,436
Let's do it.

448
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:38,545
[pants] Tonight.

449
00:39:45,177 --> 00:39:47,179
[Mark panting]

450
00:39:48,972 --> 00:39:50,974
[breathing heavily]

451
00:40:04,738 --> 00:40:05,739
[grunts]

452
00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:19,670
[exhales sharply]

453
00:40:41,233 --> 00:40:43,527
[strains, inhales deeply]

454
00:40:49,783 --> 00:40:51,743
[grunting, breathing heavily]

455
00:40:52,786 --> 00:40:53,996
[groans]

456
00:40:56,081 --> 00:40:58,876
[breathing heavily]

457
00:41:05,591 --> 00:41:07,050
[breathing heavily]

458
00:42:17,955 --> 00:42:20,958
[breathes heavily, sighs]

459
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:37,432
[sighs] There.

460
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,579
How long will it take?

461
00:42:41,603 --> 00:42:43,188
It'll be fast.

462
00:42:44,022 --> 00:42:45,708
Fast. How fast?

463
00:42:45,732 --> 00:42:47,234
[rumbling, whirring]

464
00:42:51,196 --> 00:42:52,531
[panting]

465
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,285
[rumbling continues]

466
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,620
[Helly] <i>I'm nervous.</i>

467
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:01,456
<i>Yes.</i>

468
00:43:02,374 --> 00:43:03,709
[breathing heavily]

469
00:43:15,429 --> 00:43:17,115
[gasps] What the fuck?

470
00:43:17,139 --> 00:43:20,201
- Don't move like that.
- [groaning]

471
00:43:20,225 --> 00:43:22,465
- [breathing heavily]
- You have to keep your head still.

472
00:43:23,145 --> 00:43:24,414
[groans]

473
00:43:24,438 --> 00:43:25,689
- [knocking]
- [gasps]

474
00:43:27,441 --> 00:43:28,442
Ignore it.

475
00:43:29,234 --> 00:43:30,295
Tell me--

476
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:32,070
- [groaning]
- [knocking continues]

477
00:43:33,113 --> 00:43:35,925
- [Devon] Mark?
- [groaning]

478
00:43:35,949 --> 00:43:37,760
My car's in the driveway.
She knows I'm here.

479
00:43:37,784 --> 00:43:39,286
No... [stammers]

480
00:43:40,454 --> 00:43:41,997
[sighs]

481
00:43:42,789 --> 00:43:44,100
[exhaling sharply]

482
00:43:44,124 --> 00:43:45,393
[knocking]

483
00:43:45,417 --> 00:43:46,561
- [Devon] Mark.
- Yeah?

484
00:43:46,585 --> 00:43:50,047
[breathing heavily]

485
00:43:50,839 --> 00:43:51,816
Hey.

486
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:54,110
Dude, I left you, like, five messages.
Are you better?

487
00:43:54,134 --> 00:43:55,987
No, I'm still sick.

488
00:43:56,011 --> 00:43:59,115
Well, you can't not pick up when
we're doing corporate espionage shit.

489
00:43:59,139 --> 00:44:00,658
The floodlight thing was a bust, right?

490
00:44:00,682 --> 00:44:03,119
Because I have had an idea
that is a little dumber.

491
00:44:03,143 --> 00:44:04,204
Okay, Devon...

492
00:44:04,228 --> 00:44:05,747
Do you remember
the rich lady from baby camp?

493
00:44:05,771 --> 00:44:07,606
The one I, like, kind of had a crush on?

494
00:44:08,106 --> 00:44:10,043
- I was thinking--
- Yeah. Look, uh,

495
00:44:10,067 --> 00:44:12,444
I'm already trying something else.

496
00:44:14,947 --> 00:44:16,532
Okay. What are you trying?

497
00:44:17,658 --> 00:44:20,637
Just don't worry about it.

498
00:44:20,661 --> 00:44:23,389
- What the fuck does that mean?
- I'm doing it myself.

499
00:44:23,413 --> 00:44:26,226
[stammers] F-Fuck that.

500
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:27,977
Why are you trying to cut me out of this?

501
00:44:28,001 --> 00:44:30,462
[gasps] Shit.

502
00:44:31,755 --> 00:44:33,316
I'm really not, Devon.

503
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:35,276
- You... You literally are. [chuckles]
- Okay, fine.

504
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:38,154
I am, but I didn't ask for your help!

505
00:44:38,178 --> 00:44:39,447
Fuck you, officially.

506
00:44:39,471 --> 00:44:41,807
And what is that smell?

507
00:44:43,475 --> 00:44:44,476
[Devon] What smell?

508
00:44:59,324 --> 00:45:01,326
[breathes heavily]

509
00:45:05,497 --> 00:45:06,540
Oh, my God.

510
00:45:11,211 --> 00:45:13,064
- [grunts]
- Mark.

511
00:45:13,088 --> 00:45:14,232
[Reghabi] Don't touch him.

512
00:45:14,256 --> 00:45:15,841
[Devon] Who the fuck are you?

513
00:45:16,717 --> 00:45:17,694
Mark?

514
00:45:17,718 --> 00:45:19,195
[gasping]

515
00:45:19,219 --> 00:45:21,531
[Devon] It's okay.
It's okay, buddy. It's okay.

516
00:45:21,555 --> 00:45:22,848
It's okay.

517
00:45:29,438 --> 00:45:31,791
Thank you for the spare ham.

518
00:45:31,815 --> 00:45:33,376
Is Fields...

519
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,278
He's fine. He'll be embarrassed tomorrow.

520
00:45:37,196 --> 00:45:39,257
You know, he... he gets fuzzy.

521
00:45:39,281 --> 00:45:41,301
Like saying I worked
at Lumon 20 years ago,

522
00:45:41,325 --> 00:45:44,888
which is, of course,
before severance even existed.

523
00:45:44,912 --> 00:45:45,996
Of course.

524
00:45:48,999 --> 00:45:53,480
- Sorry.
- No, this... this was fun.

525
00:45:53,504 --> 00:45:55,106
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Yeah.

526
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:58,091
So, we should do it again sometime.

527
00:45:59,551 --> 00:46:01,362
You, me, Fields? Or you, me?

528
00:46:01,386 --> 00:46:03,990
Oh... [stammers] No, I meant with Fields.

529
00:46:04,014 --> 00:46:06,099
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

530
00:46:07,017 --> 00:46:13,440
Yeah. But, you know, it's either way.

531
00:46:16,527 --> 00:46:18,612
- Good. [chuckles]
- [chuckles]

532
00:46:24,117 --> 00:46:25,577
- Good night, Burt.
- Good night.
