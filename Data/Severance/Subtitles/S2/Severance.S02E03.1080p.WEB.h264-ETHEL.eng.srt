1
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:40,082
Ow.

2
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:17,846
Good morning, Mr. Scout.

3
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:48,377
One, two, three, four, five,

4
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:54,591
six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12.

5
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:59,638
Thirty-two, 33, 34,

6
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:03,725
35, 36, thirty-se--

7
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:37,486
Okay, me and Helly will find the goat man
and other possible goat people.

8
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:39,363
Dylan, hit the new break room.

9
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,448
Maybe some of
the other departments use it too.

10
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:43,450
Um, yeah. Maybe later.

11
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,329
Uh, okay.
This is kind of important, Dylan.

12
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,667
Yeah. Uh, I'm in a good groove here,
but don't worry about it. I'll get to it.

13
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:56,338
Okay. Well, just show them the sketch.
Do not leave it behind.

14
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,300
O… O&D.

15
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,638
Yes, Irv. You can do this.

16
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:07,683
I know.

17
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,828
You guys really think
they're gonna let us roam around?

18
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:13,021
They said on the video
we can go wherever we want.

19
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:14,940
Lumon is listening, remember?

20
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,168
I thought that meant
they were listening to our conversations.

21
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:20,779
Yeah, he's right, Mark.
I did get the hint of a double meaning.

22
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:23,490
Well… …be discreet.

23
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:26,368
If they don't know we're doing it,
how can they punish us?

24
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:32,249
Hey, y-you…
you haven't been back there, have you?

25
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,584
No, no.

26
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,340
We've got you.

27
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:44,386
Thank you, Helly.

28
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:57,691
So, say we find her…

29
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:58,901
Sorry?

30
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:01,195
Say we get to the goat department
and they're like,

31
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:05,073
"Yes, Ms. Casey's here.
She's in this goat cage."

32
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:06,241
What do we do then?

33
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:09,494
Well, we get her to the south stairwell…
I'll go with her…

34
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:12,831
and once we're out the door,
my outie'll know what to do.

35
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:17,002
Right. Okay. Well, sounds like
you've got it figured out.

36
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:24,134
Are you sure you're okay
helping me out with this?

37
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,096
Yeah, of course.

38
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:31,808
Okay, good.

39
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:51,370
Yeah.

40
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,004
Um…

41
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,845
I… I… Um.

42
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:53,390
Dylan.

43
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,685
I thought you were going to O&D.

44
00:07:58,604 --> 00:07:59,605
Dylan.

45
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:03,025
I've recreated the paintings.

46
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:07,446
The ones I told you about.
The ones my outie was working on.

47
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:08,530
What?

48
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:10,449
You see, I've been thinking.

49
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:13,869
Maybe the hallway is really down here.

50
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,539
Maybe that's what my dreams have been.

51
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,460
We could look for it, Dylan.

52
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:24,087
We could go today.

53
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,673
You could accompany me.

54
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,802
Yeah. Um,

55
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:33,597
yeah, maybe.

56
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:38,602
Or maybe… maybe you go yourself,
like, for… for stealth, you know?

57
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:42,648
- S… Stealth?
- Yeah.

58
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:45,317
Look, I… I can't really explain. I just--

59
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:48,820
Miss Huang.

60
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:57,621
Hall pass.

61
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:07,464
Everything chill?

62
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:13,470
Dylan G., come with me, please.

63
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:19,768
Good morning, Seth.

64
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:21,854
Natalie.

65
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:27,150
Looks like your balloons
could use some coffee.

66
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:30,195
Uh, they were in the--

67
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,572
I've got the Board.

68
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:33,866
Of course.

69
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:39,454
Hello.

70
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:42,916
The Board says, "Hello."

71
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:52,926
Hello. I want to thank the Board humbly
for my recent betterment.

72
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,726
The Board says, "You're welcome."

73
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:06,440
The Board is jubilant at your ascendance.

74
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:10,027
It wants you to feel appreciated
and asks if you do.

75
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:13,071
I do.

76
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:22,539
The Board austerely desires for you
to feel connected to Lumon's history.

77
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:25,000
To that end,

78
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:31,965
please accept from the Board these
inclusively re-canonicalized paintings

79
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:36,345
intended to help you see yourself
in Kier, our founder.

80
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:08,210
Oh. Oh, my.

81
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:10,838
You'll find the whole Kier cycle.

82
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:33,360
The Board wishes to express
that I, Natalie,

83
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:37,114
received the same gift
upon receipt of my current position

84
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,616
and found it extremely moving.

85
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:42,703
I'm grateful.

86
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:43,620
Yes.

87
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:49,877
It's meaningful
to see myself reflected in…

88
00:11:58,302 --> 00:12:00,179
The Board has concluded the call.

89
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:18,864
Congratulations, Seth.

90
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:53,584
Is that it?

91
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:55,085
Think so.

92
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:20,652
Whoa.

93
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:31,914
Oh, you're gonna--

94
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:37,794
You sure?

95
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:42,216
Okay.

96
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:50,641
All right.
Okay, we're doing this.

97
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:55,437
Can you see anything?

98
00:14:56,605 --> 00:14:59,233
No. Careful, there's poop.

99
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:00,651
Okay.

100
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:06,281
Okay.

101
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,638
Oh, my God.

102
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:32,057
What the hell?

103
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:10,387
Are you here to kill me?

104
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:14,725
Uh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no.

105
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:18,020
I… Sorry. Hi, I-I… I'm Mark.

106
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:21,481
- I'm Helly.
- And we're with Macrodata Refinement.

107
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:31,617
What is this place?

108
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:36,997
Mammalians Nurturable.

109
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:48,008
Please, we…
we mean you no harm. We just wanna talk.

110
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:49,843
Please.

111
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:52,906
Irving.

112
00:17:54,283 --> 00:17:55,909
Felicia, hello.

113
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:59,413
I'm… I'm sorry to pop in
after all this time.

114
00:17:59,496 --> 00:18:01,832
I'm sure you must be very busy.

115
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,376
It's good to see you.

116
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:28,358
Her name's Ms. Casey.

117
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:31,069
She's our former Wellness Director.

118
00:18:41,205 --> 00:18:42,206
Wellness…

119
00:18:48,712 --> 00:18:51,089
we don't abide such fripperies here.

120
00:18:55,344 --> 00:18:58,972
Right. Well, she's been retired, but
we believe she may still be on the floor.

121
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:01,391
Are you sure you don't know her?

122
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:10,400
Maybe you should take that page
of paper and be on your way.

123
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:13,403
Not until you've answered my question.

124
00:19:17,074 --> 00:19:18,408
Mark.

125
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:46,687
You should have left.

126
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:07,708
Um, it would be cool to know
what this is about.

127
00:20:15,716 --> 00:20:19,928
So, like, is it rude to keep asking
why you're a kid?

128
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:26,852
I… I don't mean to impugn.
It's just like, are you okay, you know?

129
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:28,975
They're not, like,
forcing you to be here, are they?

130
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:35,861
Oh, fuck.

131
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:43,785
Why are we going to the security room?

132
00:21:31,542 --> 00:21:32,543
Wow.

133
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:38,298
Dylan?

134
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,386
Hi.

135
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:44,972
Hi.

136
00:21:51,436 --> 00:21:55,357
Dylan G.,
through good behavior and output,

137
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,694
you've earned an 18-minute
visitation event with your outie's wife,

138
00:21:59,611 --> 00:22:00,612
Gretchen G.

139
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,157
Cool.

140
00:22:04,908 --> 00:22:06,451
Your time begins now.

141
00:22:20,841 --> 00:22:22,009
Should we sit?

142
00:22:37,149 --> 00:22:38,150
Nice sack.

143
00:22:38,901 --> 00:22:39,902
Sorry?

144
00:22:40,861 --> 00:22:43,363
Uh, your… The, um--

145
00:22:43,447 --> 00:22:48,493
Oh, thanks.
Um, they made me put my stuff in here.

146
00:22:49,077 --> 00:22:52,289
Badass.

147
00:22:53,624 --> 00:22:57,669
You really don't know me at all?

148
00:22:59,046 --> 00:23:04,259
No. Um… Well, I mean,
from the photos from just now, but…

149
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:09,056
Yeah, Seth warned me
that this might be weird.

150
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:13,852
- Who's Seth?
- Don't you--

151
00:23:13,936 --> 00:23:15,729
Please refrain from sharing information

152
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:17,981
that may be privileged or sensitive.

153
00:23:18,649 --> 00:23:19,650
Thank you.

154
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:21,360
Okay.

155
00:23:21,443 --> 00:23:23,195
Who is that child?

156
00:23:23,946 --> 00:23:24,947
Miss Huang.

157
00:23:30,953 --> 00:23:35,999
Look. Uh, it's really nice to meet you,
but am I in trouble?

158
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:39,711
Oh, no. No, you're not…
you're not in trouble.

159
00:23:39,795 --> 00:23:40,963
Um…

160
00:23:45,217 --> 00:23:46,760
We have three kids.

161
00:23:48,637 --> 00:23:49,638
Right.

162
00:23:49,721 --> 00:23:53,934
And y-you, um…

163
00:23:54,017 --> 00:23:56,144
No, he… Or--

164
00:24:00,649 --> 00:24:05,445
My husband has had trouble
keeping other jobs.

165
00:24:07,072 --> 00:24:08,073
He dumb?

166
00:24:08,657 --> 00:24:09,950
No.

167
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:11,326
He a dick?

168
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:12,661
No.

169
00:24:13,287 --> 00:24:14,788
What is wrong with him?

170
00:24:14,872 --> 00:24:16,957
Oh, nothing's wrong with him.

171
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:19,209
He just…

172
00:24:21,753 --> 00:24:24,089
He never quite found his thing.

173
00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:35,559
So he's actually kind of a fuck up?

174
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:47,070
Do you wanna see a picture of the kids?

175
00:24:49,656 --> 00:24:50,741
Yeah.

176
00:24:54,453 --> 00:24:55,996
Okay.

177
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:07,508
So, Jim is six.
He's in the first grade now.

178
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:10,677
And Ruth is four.

179
00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:13,972
And Merrick just turned two.

180
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:15,891
Wow.

181
00:25:16,725 --> 00:25:18,060
Holy shit.

182
00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:21,480
Look at them.

183
00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:24,900
They're awesome.

184
00:25:27,027 --> 00:25:28,028
They are.

185
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,453
And we live on a cattle ranch?

186
00:25:42,543 --> 00:25:44,795
And then… And Burt says,

187
00:25:46,296 --> 00:25:50,008
"I don't care if
you're Baird goddamn Eagan,

188
00:25:50,092 --> 00:25:54,179
you don't come to my department
and tell me how to print a snow globe."

189
00:25:57,474 --> 00:26:00,477
I ca… My God, he was… he was fearless.

190
00:26:00,561 --> 00:26:03,939
I worked with Burt for six years.

191
00:26:04,773 --> 00:26:07,234
And I only ever saw him
scared of one thing.

192
00:26:09,486 --> 00:26:12,823
He spent two hours on his hair
the first time he went to visit you.

193
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:15,534
Really?

194
00:26:18,996 --> 00:26:22,374
I should…
…I should show you something.

195
00:26:24,209 --> 00:26:26,628
- If we see her--
- N-Not her… Not her. It's a…

196
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:30,465
Here.

197
00:26:34,344 --> 00:26:38,765
Oh, Irving, it's lovely.

198
00:26:39,266 --> 00:26:42,102
I'd draw one every day I couldn't see him.

199
00:26:42,811 --> 00:26:45,397
My numbers went down,
but I didn't even care.

200
00:26:54,823 --> 00:26:56,909
Oh, no.
That's… That's not Burt.

201
00:26:56,992 --> 00:27:00,579
That's s…That's something else.
That's just a… That's nothing.

202
00:27:01,914 --> 00:27:04,124
It's…

203
00:27:06,168 --> 00:27:08,629
How do you know about the exports hall?

204
00:27:13,467 --> 00:27:14,551
I'm sorry?

205
00:27:19,097 --> 00:27:21,141
We send a lot of shipments there.

206
00:27:22,726 --> 00:27:24,311
Used to go ourselves.

207
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:28,273
But now, they send a guy.

208
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:35,155
Do you remember where it is?

209
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:47,459
Hello.

210
00:27:49,378 --> 00:27:50,379
Hi.

211
00:27:59,388 --> 00:28:02,599
- Excuse me. Have you seen this woman?
- Hey! Stop that!

212
00:28:02,683 --> 00:28:04,935
Her name's Ms. Casey.
She was the Wellness director.

213
00:28:05,018 --> 00:28:07,271
- Stop that!
- Have any of you seen her?

214
00:28:08,021 --> 00:28:12,526
Enough! We've decided to send a courier
to inform Mr. Milchick of your inquiry.

215
00:28:12,609 --> 00:28:15,737
No, no, no, no. You can't do that.
They could kill her if they find out--

216
00:28:15,821 --> 00:28:18,115
That's not a Mammalians problem.

217
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:19,908
It's an innie problem.

218
00:28:19,992 --> 00:28:22,661
Listen, we used to be afraid of
other departments too--

219
00:28:22,744 --> 00:28:23,954
We're not afraid of you.

220
00:28:24,872 --> 00:28:27,249
Look, they just disappeared her.

221
00:28:27,332 --> 00:28:29,793
And if we let this happen to Ms. Casey,

222
00:28:29,877 --> 00:28:32,546
then who's gonna step up
when it happens to us?

223
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:42,222
If one of your goats went missing,
wouldn't you go looking for it?

224
00:29:03,702 --> 00:29:06,997
She used to come do her sessions
in our husbandry tanks.

225
00:29:11,668 --> 00:29:13,837
She had a gentle way about her.

226
00:29:15,964 --> 00:29:18,967
She said my outie excels at stargazing.

227
00:29:21,595 --> 00:29:23,055
Meant a great deal to me.

228
00:29:28,393 --> 00:29:33,232
As far as we know,
she was retired, just like they say.

229
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:41,198
But if you suspect otherwise,
we won't hinder your search.

230
00:29:43,116 --> 00:29:44,201
Thank you.

231
00:29:44,993 --> 00:29:46,203
Yes, thank you.

232
00:29:56,588 --> 00:29:58,549
But before you go, we would…

233
00:30:02,928 --> 00:30:04,596
like to see your bellies.

234
00:30:07,516 --> 00:30:08,725
Our bellies?

235
00:30:11,103 --> 00:30:12,104
Please.

236
00:30:17,025 --> 00:30:18,026
Okay.

237
00:30:29,204 --> 00:30:31,164
See? Pouchless.

238
00:30:34,334 --> 00:30:35,460
Proves nothing.

239
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:42,759
Uh, okay. Let's--

240
00:30:42,843 --> 00:30:45,262
- So we'll just… Yeah.
- Yeah.

241
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:54,521
Uh--

242
00:30:57,691 --> 00:30:58,859
Uh…

243
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,612
I'm… I'm glad we did this.

244
00:31:02,487 --> 00:31:06,617
I mean, I hope, for you, this was…
I don't know. Uh…

245
00:31:07,618 --> 00:31:08,702
Yeah, it was.

246
00:31:10,245 --> 00:31:12,873
And I'll be good.
I'm gonna make you all proud.

247
00:31:15,167 --> 00:31:17,085
I'm always proud of you, Dylan.

248
00:31:18,504 --> 00:31:19,505
Cool.

249
00:31:22,341 --> 00:31:23,342
Um…

250
00:31:30,224 --> 00:31:31,558
I love you.

251
00:31:33,185 --> 00:31:34,186
Oh.

252
00:31:35,812 --> 00:31:36,855
Sorry.

253
00:31:36,939 --> 00:31:38,524
- Habit.
- No, it's, um…

254
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:44,821
Okay.

255
00:31:49,993 --> 00:31:52,204
All right.

256
00:31:55,415 --> 00:31:56,959
- Bye.
- Yeah.

257
00:32:26,947 --> 00:32:30,868
So remember Merrick's ear thing, okay?

258
00:32:30,951 --> 00:32:31,952
Copy that.

259
00:32:32,035 --> 00:32:34,204
- Left ear.
- Yep.

260
00:32:34,288 --> 00:32:37,124
And did you do the cookies
for Jim's class?

261
00:32:37,207 --> 00:32:38,208
Bye.

262
00:32:38,292 --> 00:32:41,086
It's our week for cookies. Mmm.

263
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:45,340
I did not do the cookies. Sorry.

264
00:32:47,009 --> 00:32:50,179
So, it's a tube
and you just need to slice them

265
00:32:50,262 --> 00:32:52,973
- and then you put them in the oven.
- Got it, yeah.

266
00:32:53,056 --> 00:32:55,893
Love you. Mmm.

267
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:59,813
Hey, um, how was the thing?

268
00:32:59,897 --> 00:33:01,190
What thing?

269
00:33:03,025 --> 00:33:04,151
The thing with me.

270
00:33:05,861 --> 00:33:08,947
Oh. Yeah, it was good.

271
00:33:09,031 --> 00:33:10,324
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

272
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:13,619
Weird good, but good.

273
00:33:13,702 --> 00:33:15,037
Cool.

274
00:33:16,121 --> 00:33:20,250
Yeah. Okay. Okay, okay.
I'll see you in the morning.

275
00:33:20,334 --> 00:33:21,335
- Bye.
- Bye.

276
00:33:21,418 --> 00:33:22,794
- Bye.
- Bye.

277
00:33:29,801 --> 00:33:34,139
"But surely beer and juleps
cannot fill the void left by love.

278
00:33:34,806 --> 00:33:39,186
Indeed, only wine can achieve this,
but it is famously costly,

279
00:33:39,686 --> 00:33:43,815
which is why sadness is among the most
recurrent issues facing the poor."

280
00:33:44,858 --> 00:33:47,569
Remarkable. So astute.

281
00:33:47,653 --> 00:33:50,239
Is it? That's what I was going for.

282
00:33:50,322 --> 00:33:51,365
- Hi.
- Hmm.

283
00:33:51,448 --> 00:33:53,158
Oh, my babe.

284
00:33:53,242 --> 00:33:57,913
Um, this is Natalie Kalen from Lumon.

285
00:33:58,789 --> 00:33:59,957
Is everything okay?

286
00:34:00,624 --> 00:34:02,376
Oh, yes. God, yes.

287
00:34:02,459 --> 00:34:07,339
Uh, Natalie just stopped by to, um,
discuss my book, actually.

288
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,007
Oh.

289
00:34:09,091 --> 00:34:12,928
It's a joy to meet you, Devon.
You must be so proud.

290
00:34:13,011 --> 00:34:14,221
Mmm.

291
00:34:15,222 --> 00:34:16,223
I am.

292
00:34:16,764 --> 00:34:18,684
I'm sure you know by now
that your husband's work

293
00:34:18,725 --> 00:34:20,893
has found its way onto our severed floor.

294
00:34:20,978 --> 00:34:24,313
Yeah.
Do we know how that happened yet?

295
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:29,152
Uh, so w-we've actually moved beyond that,
and we are now discussing the, um--

296
00:34:29,235 --> 00:34:31,989
Uh, what was the…
the term you used?

297
00:34:32,072 --> 00:34:34,324
- The result.
- The result.

298
00:34:34,408 --> 00:34:36,243
Ricken's words have had a profound effect

299
00:34:36,326 --> 00:34:37,703
- upon our workers.
- Huh.

300
00:34:37,786 --> 00:34:39,663
We think he's really tapped
into something.

301
00:34:39,746 --> 00:34:44,251
And, uh, Natalie wants to discuss
a version of The You You Are,

302
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:47,129
specifically for innies.

303
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,880
Oh.

304
00:34:49,422 --> 00:34:53,969
Okay, w-well, that's cool. I mean,
but what's wrong with the current version?

305
00:34:54,594 --> 00:34:55,596
Nothing.

306
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,724
No, uh, the… the explanation
is actually very interesting.

307
00:34:58,807 --> 00:35:03,353
Um…

308
00:35:03,437 --> 00:35:05,272
It's fascinating, actually. You, please.

309
00:35:05,355 --> 00:35:09,443
There's a certain verbiage
to which innies respond more favorably.

310
00:35:09,526 --> 00:35:11,445
If we just tweak it here and there.

311
00:35:12,362 --> 00:35:14,865
They think that it could be
a real game changer.

312
00:35:17,951 --> 00:35:18,952
Gotcha.

313
00:35:19,536 --> 00:35:22,456
Um, I gotta go.
But she needs a bottle in an hour. So…

314
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,166
Of course.

315
00:35:24,666 --> 00:35:26,877
- Devon.
- Yes?

316
00:35:28,045 --> 00:35:32,466
Can I just say, your brother is one of
the sweetest members of our severed team.

317
00:35:34,426 --> 00:35:35,677
Yeah, he's a good egg.

318
00:35:37,054 --> 00:35:38,805
Okay. One hour.

319
00:35:42,601 --> 00:35:44,520
So she said her name's Natalie?

320
00:35:44,603 --> 00:35:46,313
Natalie Kalen, I think.

321
00:35:47,189 --> 00:35:50,526
Wh-What… Was she asking,
like, what I'm up to or--

322
00:35:50,609 --> 00:35:52,945
Nope, 'cause it's Ricken they're after.

323
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:55,405
- Ricken?
- Yep. His book.

324
00:35:55,489 --> 00:35:56,490
What?

325
00:35:56,573 --> 00:35:59,409
I guess… …you and
your work friends were so inspired by it.

326
00:35:59,493 --> 00:36:00,661
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- Yep.

327
00:36:00,744 --> 00:36:03,956
That they're… They wanna do like a…
an innie specific cut.

328
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:07,793
Wow, okay. Well, there's just…
There's a lot I'm not gonna say.

329
00:36:07,876 --> 00:36:09,711
And that is so appreciated.

330
00:36:12,506 --> 00:36:14,675
Have you told Ricken
what we're doing here?

331
00:36:14,758 --> 00:36:16,760
- Are you insane? No.
- Okay.

332
00:36:18,345 --> 00:36:20,055
- Good.
- Okay,

333
00:36:20,138 --> 00:36:22,700
so you need to see the afterimage
for, like, two and a half minutes?

334
00:36:22,724 --> 00:36:24,560
Two minutes, 18 seconds.

335
00:36:24,643 --> 00:36:27,980
It's from the parking spot
to the elevator, give or take.

336
00:36:31,066 --> 00:36:34,820
Yeah, I think the Whole Mind Collective
would be very proud of this.

337
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,798
As well as your kindergarten teacher.

338
00:36:36,822 --> 00:36:38,699
What the fuck was her name?
Mrs. Lustgarten?

339
00:36:38,782 --> 00:36:41,368
- Yeah, Mrs. Lustgarten. Yeah.
- Wow.

340
00:36:41,869 --> 00:36:42,870
She really got me.

341
00:36:42,953 --> 00:36:46,456
Yeah. Fuck, I gotta skedaddle.

342
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,417
Will you be careful, please?

343
00:36:49,251 --> 00:36:50,586
Yeah.

344
00:36:51,378 --> 00:36:52,713
Okay.

345
00:36:53,338 --> 00:36:54,464
I do love you.

346
00:36:55,966 --> 00:36:56,967
Okay.

347
00:36:57,634 --> 00:36:59,915
Even thought you left me
with the check at Pips, you dick.

348
00:37:00,554 --> 00:37:01,555
Thanks.

349
00:37:01,638 --> 00:37:03,098
You're welcome.

350
00:38:52,124 --> 00:38:54,668
Two,

351
00:38:54,751 --> 00:38:58,172
three, four, five,

352
00:38:58,255 --> 00:39:00,591
six, seven,

353
00:39:00,674 --> 00:39:04,261
eight, nine, ten,

354
00:39:04,344 --> 00:39:07,764
11, 12. Shit.

355
00:39:09,975 --> 00:39:12,477
Fuck.

356
00:40:18,252 --> 00:40:23,632
If you want me back,
you must accommodate my needs.

357
00:40:27,219 --> 00:40:28,387
I'm listening.

358
00:40:30,556 --> 00:40:33,267
MDR. Non-negotiable.

359
00:40:35,686 --> 00:40:41,066
Mark S. is so close
to completing Cold Harbor.

360
00:40:42,401 --> 00:40:45,863
I intend to finish the work
that I started,

361
00:40:47,406 --> 00:40:48,615
which is why

362
00:40:50,284 --> 00:40:51,827
Milchick must go.

363
00:40:53,078 --> 00:40:55,247
He's not equipped for the task.

364
00:40:57,624 --> 00:40:59,710
I must be floor manager.

365
00:41:05,549 --> 00:41:06,925
I hear ego…

366
00:41:11,013 --> 00:41:12,014
hubris…

367
00:41:14,016 --> 00:41:15,017
arrogance.

368
00:41:17,895 --> 00:41:20,522
Kier teaches us they only cause pain.

369
00:41:22,816 --> 00:41:25,235
Everything I accomplished, I earned…

370
00:41:28,405 --> 00:41:31,116
through dedication and industry,

371
00:41:32,284 --> 00:41:35,078
not because I was born into it.

372
00:41:42,961 --> 00:41:45,714
I think you've overestimated
your contributions

373
00:41:47,049 --> 00:41:49,218
and underestimated your blessings.

374
00:41:52,971 --> 00:41:54,723
We didn't have to ask you back.

375
00:41:58,018 --> 00:42:00,229
You didn't have a choice.

376
00:42:03,023 --> 00:42:04,149
Are you sure?

377
00:42:12,241 --> 00:42:13,742
Why don't we reset?

378
00:42:16,161 --> 00:42:17,746
It doesn't have to be this way.

379
00:42:30,217 --> 00:42:31,218
Natalie.

380
00:42:32,761 --> 00:42:36,139
Please see if the Board is available

381
00:42:37,057 --> 00:42:38,725
for Ms. Cobel and myself.

382
00:42:52,114 --> 00:42:53,699
Let's go speak with them together.

383
00:43:58,472 --> 00:43:59,473
Harmony.

384
00:44:45,185 --> 00:44:50,440
Thirty-three, 34, 35, 36,

385
00:44:51,692 --> 00:44:52,693
thirty s--

386
00:44:53,277 --> 00:44:54,987
Jesus Christ.

387
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:59,491
Are you trying to burn a message
to your innie into your retinas

388
00:44:59,575 --> 00:45:03,370
because your computer told you
that was a brilliant idea?

389
00:45:06,081 --> 00:45:07,082
Yeah.

390
00:45:09,042 --> 00:45:12,004
No, no. What? No, no, no, no, no.

391
00:45:12,087 --> 00:45:14,339
What are you… What?

392
00:45:14,965 --> 00:45:16,258
It doesn't work.

393
00:45:17,342 --> 00:45:20,262
- No shit.
- The switch briefly dilates the pupils.

394
00:45:20,345 --> 00:45:21,180
Clean slate.

395
00:45:21,263 --> 00:45:23,765
- Okay, thank you. Thanks.
- Also, you could blind yourself.

396
00:45:23,849 --> 00:45:26,643
And how was the innie
gonna send you a message back? Hmm?

397
00:45:26,727 --> 00:45:29,980
Uh, that's his problem. I don't know.

398
00:45:30,647 --> 00:45:32,399
Mark, unlock the door.

399
00:45:32,482 --> 00:45:33,483
Why?

400
00:45:34,234 --> 00:45:35,319
We need to talk.

401
00:45:36,028 --> 00:45:38,113
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Mark, unlock the--

402
00:45:38,197 --> 00:45:41,658
Mark, unlock this fucking door!

403
00:45:45,954 --> 00:45:48,957
Goddamn it.
This goddamn fucking thing.

404
00:45:52,586 --> 00:45:55,005
- What?
- There's an easier way.

405
00:45:57,633 --> 00:46:00,093
Didn't seem particularly easy for Petey.

406
00:46:02,179 --> 00:46:03,764
Heard about the OTC.

407
00:46:08,268 --> 00:46:12,064
Yeah, my sister talked to my innie.
He said a lot of things.

408
00:46:15,025 --> 00:46:17,402
Did he tell her
your wife is alive at Lumon?

409
00:46:20,948 --> 00:46:22,157
Who told you that?

410
00:46:33,418 --> 00:46:34,419
Is she?

411
00:46:44,137 --> 00:46:46,431
Is Gemma alive?

412
00:46:49,476 --> 00:46:51,353
She was, the last time I saw her.

413
00:47:32,186 --> 00:47:34,021
How could you not tell me?

414
00:47:34,104 --> 00:47:36,690
We were interrupted, if you recall.

415
00:47:37,691 --> 00:47:41,945
Mark, I want to help you,
but you have to trust me.

416
00:47:42,029 --> 00:47:45,282
How the fu…

417
00:47:45,365 --> 00:47:49,620
There is one way, and one way only,
to get information in and out of Lumon,

418
00:47:49,703 --> 00:47:51,538
and that's reintegration.

419
00:47:51,622 --> 00:47:55,792
I'm better at it now.
I can make it work with you.

420
00:47:55,876 --> 00:47:59,254
I can sew together a version of you that
loves her with a version of you that can--

421
00:47:59,338 --> 00:48:01,048
Yes. Do it.

422
00:48:04,927 --> 00:48:05,928
You're sure?

423
00:48:07,221 --> 00:48:09,806
I wanna see my wife.

424
00:49:04,069 --> 00:49:07,489
The monitors differentiate
the five brain wave frequencies

425
00:49:07,573 --> 00:49:08,699
of the innie and outie.

426
00:49:09,533 --> 00:49:11,869
Delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma.

427
00:49:12,619 --> 00:49:16,957
One frequency, two waves per oscilloscope.

428
00:49:18,083 --> 00:49:21,336
The waves aren't in sync. Not yet, anyway.

429
00:49:22,337 --> 00:49:24,464
That's what we're here to do.

430
00:49:27,176 --> 00:49:28,177
Lean forward.

431
00:49:29,178 --> 00:49:30,179
Uh…

432
00:49:32,181 --> 00:49:34,766
…is it gonna hurt?

433
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:36,226
Ideally not.

434
00:49:37,686 --> 00:49:39,271
What does your mouth taste like?

435
00:49:40,856 --> 00:49:41,857
Nothing.

436
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:42,941
Good.

437
00:49:57,789 --> 00:50:00,167
Um, w-what the fuck?

438
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:01,251
Shit.

439
00:50:08,675 --> 00:50:09,676
You all right?

440
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,720
I don't know. Am I?

441
00:50:12,763 --> 00:50:15,974
I'm gonna start with easy questions
and get more complex.

442
00:50:16,058 --> 00:50:17,309
Do you remember protocol?

443
00:50:17,809 --> 00:50:20,729
Uh, is that the first question?

444
00:50:20,812 --> 00:50:22,481
No, we haven't started yet.

445
00:50:22,564 --> 00:50:23,857
Uh, yes, I remember.

446
00:50:23,941 --> 00:50:28,737
Relax your body. You should feel good
when this is over. Who am I?

447
00:50:30,364 --> 00:50:31,365
Okay, so are… are--

448
00:50:31,448 --> 00:50:32,866
We've started. Who am I?

449
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:34,326
Uh, Asal Reghabi.

450
00:50:34,409 --> 00:50:35,410
Where are we?

451
00:50:36,245 --> 00:50:37,246
My basement.

452
00:50:38,455 --> 00:50:39,957
What was your mother's name?

453
00:50:40,457 --> 00:50:41,542
Fern Scout.

454
00:50:42,125 --> 00:50:43,460
What was her eye color?

455
00:50:45,796 --> 00:50:47,047
Uh…

456
00:50:47,548 --> 00:50:48,465
Seriously?

457
00:50:48,549 --> 00:50:51,426
Brown. It was brown.

458
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:52,719
Did you love her?

459
00:50:54,137 --> 00:50:55,138
Yeah.

460
00:50:58,392 --> 00:51:00,227
Name a dam.

461
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:01,311
Hoover.

462
00:51:03,146 --> 00:51:05,315
What does MDR stand for?

463
00:51:06,358 --> 00:51:07,192
What?

464
00:51:07,276 --> 00:51:08,819
MDR.

465
00:51:11,613 --> 00:51:13,448
- Mystic--
- That's wrong.

466
00:51:14,616 --> 00:51:16,869
What is something
for which you feel shame?

467
00:51:18,412 --> 00:51:20,414
- Uh…
- Shame.

468
00:51:22,249 --> 00:51:25,210
My dog died w-when I was a kid.
It was my fault.

469
00:51:25,294 --> 00:51:26,587
Why?

470
00:51:28,297 --> 00:51:29,798
I left the gate open.

471
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:32,593
Where were you born?

472
00:51:36,638 --> 00:51:40,142
Uh. I'm not sure.

473
00:51:41,351 --> 00:51:43,020
What month is it?

474
00:51:43,103 --> 00:51:44,188
You mean, what quarter?

475
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:47,316
Wait.

476
00:51:48,317 --> 00:51:49,902
What is your first memory?

477
00:51:51,111 --> 00:51:54,072
- I don't know.
- Tell me.

478
00:51:56,116 --> 00:51:57,117
Holy shit.

479
00:51:58,702 --> 00:52:00,787
- I don't know. I don't remember.
- Tell me.

480
00:52:00,871 --> 00:52:03,165
- Tell me your first memory.
- I don't remember.

481
00:52:03,248 --> 00:52:05,876
Hey there, you on the table.

482
00:52:05,959 --> 00:52:08,170
I wonder if you'd mind taking
a brief survey.

483
00:52:09,671 --> 00:52:11,048
Five questions.

484
00:52:11,757 --> 00:52:15,135
To start out, who are you?
