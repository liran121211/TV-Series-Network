1
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:04,390
The Flint Lock... whoa!

2
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:10,790
Steve!

3
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:13,290
Nerd!

4
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:16,230
Flint Lockwood!

5
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,140
Uh oh!

6
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,180
<i>Shoo! Shoo! Get away,
you stinky rat-birds.</i>

7
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:36,150
Oh, Sam Sparks here.
I'm with Flint Lockwood,

8
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:39,550
Swallow Falls' most
unappreciated kid inventor.

9
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:41,220
I thought we agreed
on "best inventor"?

10
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:42,660
Shhh, we're live.

11
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:43,320
Right.

12
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,960
Hello, Swallow Fallians!

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,930
Gather round and prepare
to be awed and amazed.

14
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,930
I've got every invention
to improve your life...

15
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:53,000
Three lemonades,
Flockwood. So thirsty.

16
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,940
Mmmm. Lemonade.
Cal's favourite.

17
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:57,010
Me too!

18
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,540
Extra sour.

19
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,940
Uh, it's not that kind of stand.

20
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,210
How about Laser Soap!

21
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:07,080
Demonstrating is my trusty
lab assistant, Steve!

22
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,020
Steve!

23
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:11,650
Hot hot hot hot hot hot!

24
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,190
That's right, Steve. Get
'em while they're hot!

25
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:20,900
Booo! That is awful.
I'm Baby Brent.

26
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:24,770
Whoo! Uh oh!

27
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,740
OK. Regrouping... how about
this: Face probe!

28
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:30,140
Rainbow dust! Sentient produce!

29
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:33,170
Or this for grooming on the go,
try the Come-Here Mirror!

30
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:35,780
Hey.

31
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:38,150
Look what you did!

32
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,250
You're gonna ruin this
town, Flint Lockwood!

33
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,780
Glad he's not my son.

34
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:43,990
That kid is strange.

35
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,850
Maybe I just wasn't
cut out for this.

36
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,360
What? Don't say
that, Flint.

37
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:51,260
You just need to find that one
invention to blow them away.

38
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:55,200
Blow them away...
That's it! Reverse dynamite.

39
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,130
Do your chores.

40
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:01,700
But Da-ad, I did
those months ago.

41
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,240
That's the thing about
chores. They're cyclical.

42
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,350
They come. They go. Then
hey, there they are again.

43
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,810
What I'm saying is...

44
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:12,773
...take out the garbage.

45
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,980
I'm kind of in the middle

46
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,420
of making the world
a better place.

47
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,160
Fine. Where do
you want it?

48
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,120
The curb.

49
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,320
Right! Let's see, to
the curb. Should I push?

50
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,830
Maybe it's more of a
pulley thing? A ramp?

51
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,230
Or I could dig a trench
and fill it with water

52
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,770
and I could float
it across on a barge

53
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,063
that I build out of recyclables.

54
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,800
Or I could build
a garbage magnet

55
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,793
and reverse the polarity.

56
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,400
You're really
over-thinking this, Flint.

57
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,670
That's it!

58
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,880
Plotting, planning, thinking.

59
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,320
Accepting award for
best inventor.

60
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:49,850
Thank you!

61
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,760
Ladies and Gentlemen
and Dad, I give you

62
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:59,030
the Flint Lockwood
Garbage Go Bye Bye,

63
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,900
or Fli-Lo GuhGuh-BuhBuh
for short!

64
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:18,480
No it's Guh Guh Buh Buh. Whoo!
Go Fli Guh Ba Guh Ba!

65
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,150
Ga-buh Ga buh. You know, it's
just weird like I don't really...

66
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,020
I hear the 'buh' but I don't hear the 'guh'
The emphasis is a little off though...

67
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,490
Like a baby! Guh
Guh Buh Buh!

68
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,490
Guh Buh...

69
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,720
Guh Guh Buh Buh!

70
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,360
I'll take it!
Guh Ba Ba?

71
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:33,730
Can't you just take
the garbage to the curb?

72
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,230
You better believe it, Dad!

73
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,840
You are garbage!

74
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,980
Whoo, did you see that?

75
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,780
Everyone is going to want that.

76
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,220
No one is gonna want that.

77
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,850
<i>I want that.</i>

78
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,820
Wow! Really? That's a
presale right there!

79
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,120
This is crazy!

80
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,390
Garbage.

81
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,130
Yee hoo!

82
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,500
Who is responsible for this?

83
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,500
<i>Garbage.</i>

84
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:13,740
Hey, I'm the mayor!

85
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,000
Sorry about that, Mr. Mayor!

86
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,840
Sorry about nothing!

87
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,410
That little gizmo of
yours is fantastic.

88
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,940
It's just the reason
I've been looking for

89
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,110
to fire the entire
sanitation department

90
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:27,420
and pocket the cash for myself.

91
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:31,290
I mean, integrity, protect the
taxpayers. Here's an idea:

92
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,890
can you get that
invention of yours to toss

93
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,190
all our town garbage
over to the dump?

94
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,430
Yes, sir!

95
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,460
I just have to re-calibrate
the feedback sensors,

96
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,600
amplify the power tran...

97
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:46,030
Less science-y, science,
science, and more do, do, do!

98
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:48,940
Adjusting, tweaking,
amplifying, loosening,

99
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,463
tightening, re-loosening,
re-tightening, twisting,

100
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,040
tinkering, more tinkering,

101
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,510
and a touch of
attitude for flavour.

102
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:58,310
Wooo weee. What is that stench?

103
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:01,820
Out of the way, Poindexter,
I've got some trash to toss.

104
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:05,490
Seriously? I've seen boogers
with better shades of green.

105
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,460
You. Are. Garbage!

106
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,160
Bye bye, baggy!

107
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:15,930
Hmm. Efficient, saucy and
completely terrifying.

108
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:18,530
Let's hear it for
Flink Lampshade!

109
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,940
Chore accomplished!

110
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:24,910
We'll see.

111
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,080
C'mon, Dad. Everyone
else likes what I did.

112
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,080
Sam likes what I
did. Tell him.

113
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:32,010
Oh! OK,
I like what you did.

114
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,980
See? Even the Mayor
likes what I did.

115
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,880
He gave me the key to the city.

116
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,350
Now I can finally
open this door.

117
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,290
It's just I think sometimes
there's a simpler solution

118
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,430
than all your buttons
and calculatin'.

119
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,500
It always comes back to
bite you in the caudal fin.

120
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,000
Huh!

121
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:52,100
A fish's behind. You
know, the pooper.

122
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,300
Fishing metaphors!

123
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,100
What ever happened
to acknowledgement,

124
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:59,010
appreciation, a parental
pat on the back...

125
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,270
Garbage!

126
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:05,110

Can I get your autograph?

134
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,940
Sure. No problem. Who
should I make it out to?

135
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,910
Yeah, just make it
out to my cousin.

00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,720
Hello?

180
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,230
Dad was right. There's
definitely an easier way

181
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:37,370
to take out the garbage.

182
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:40,130
Hey! What's with the long face?

183
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,700
Aaaah, sorry, it's
always that way.

184
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,640
You. Are. Garbage!

185
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,610
Think, Flint, think! I
could karate slap it.

186
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:53,750
I could, I could start
a store for robots only

187
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,380
and then when he comes in
to buy something I'll say,

188
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,350
"Hey, we're not open today"

189
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:01,160
and then I'll call the
police! For trespassing.

190
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:04,390
FLINT! Seriously.
Don't overthink it.

191
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:07,130
Hey, excuse me, mister,
the 70's called.

192
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,600
They want their moustache back!

193
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:12,570
My mother gave me
this moustache.

194
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,470
Daaad!

195
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,740
That's it! Your reign
of cleanliness is over!

196
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:25,250
Gripping.
Struggling. Stretching.

197
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,180
Look at you. Failing.
Stinking. Losing. Laming.

198
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,620
Before that. ay? Laming?

199
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:31,250
Losing?
No.

200
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:32,190
StiNo.ng?

201
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:32,850
FaiNo.g?

202
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:33,750
Look at you?

203
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,460
That's it!

204
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,490
The Come-Here Mirror!

205
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:45,770
Look at me!
Shoddy workmanship.

206
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:52,710
Cheap plastic parts. Offshore
electronics.

207
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,380
You... Are... GARBAGE.

208
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:02,320
<i>♪</i>

209
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:07,320
And now, a sacrificial gift
for our monkey overlord.

210
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,190
This town is so weird.

211
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,830
Garbage!

212
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:17,900
GARBAGE! GARBAGE! GARBAGE!

213
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:19,730
Hey! Ow!

214
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:24,170
Well, it looks like
everything is back to normal.

215
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:27,210
I proclaim myself
the Mayor once again.

216
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,780
I'm the mayorest!
A merry moda-mooda-mada-meeda

217
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:32,810
bud up doodle op deedle
op doodle up mayor!

218
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:35,750
Sorry, Dad. You were
right from the get-go.

219
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,650
I should have just
taken out the garbage

220
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,850
instead of building a super
cool, awesome killer robot.

221
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:44,730
Maybe we could start with a
simpler chore. Like... dishes.

222
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,490
Hmm, dishes.

223
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:51,570
I'LL DO IT YOUR WAY
NEXT TIME. I PROMISE!

224
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,230
Just run.

225
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:52,770
And scream?

226
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,700
Good thinking, son.
