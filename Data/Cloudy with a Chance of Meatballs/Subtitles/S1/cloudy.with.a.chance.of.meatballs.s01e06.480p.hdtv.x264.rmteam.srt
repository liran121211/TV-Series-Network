Flint Lockwood!

00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,170

12
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:50,300
Happy Birthday, Johnny Sardine!

13
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:53,100
There's no way that
sardine is 50 years old!

14
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,970
I mean look at him,
that's ridiculous.

15
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:56,940
I know. He looks
great for his age.

16
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,810
And after all these years.

17
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,010
Johnny Sardine in
the Mod 60s, the 70s

18
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,310
when he discovered rock and
roll, the power-suit 80s,

19
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,810
the slacker 90s.
Always super famous.

20
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,250
Always granting wishes.

21
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,220
It makes no sense. Unless...

22
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,850
granting wishes
is a form of energy

23
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,020
represented by "E"
over T for Time divided

24
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,860
by the rate of aging...
Nope, no sense.

25
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:19,330
Move it! Average
people back off. Uh oh!

26
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,860
Hey Sam. It's me,
Baby Brent. Boom!

27
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,730
Yo, Fishery-dude!

28
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:30,140
I wish my face could even be
more impossibly beautiful

29
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:33,010
than it already is. Just do it.

30
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,910
Oh, look at that jaw!
It's like it's 3D.

31
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,350
Thanks, Jimmy Sardinelli.

32
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:42,050
Uh oh! BB out.

33
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,280
Wow.

34
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,820
And if you think that's cool.

35
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,250
I don't. I do not.

36
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,390
There was this one time
I wished for a pony

37
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:49,420
and when I got home...

38
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:54,000
Flint, there's a pony on TV.

39
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,170
LOOK, IT'S A PONY!
THERE'S A PONY ON TV!

40
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,730
AH, IT'S LIKE A
LITTLE HORSE!

41
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,400
Whoa.

42
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,370
Flint Lockwood, I won't have
you threatening Swallow Falls'

43
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,940
most beloved wish-granting fish

44
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,510
with your jumpy up and
downy nincompoopery.

45
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:13,210
Morning Mr. Earl.
You're crushing my lungs.

46
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,350
Oh, Great Johnny Sardine.

47
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:18,250
Give me a sign that
my precious son, Cal,

48
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:21,690
loves his daddy even half as
much as his daddy loves him.

49
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:34,200
Woohoo! You did it
again, Johnny Sardine.

50
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,410
You did it again. Happy
Birthday. Whoo hoo hoo!

51
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,840
Give it a go.

52
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,510
Oh fine. But only to
prove how lame this is.

53
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,010
How 'bout an ice cream.

54
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,950
Wha?! How.
Did that happen?

55
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,790
That's the power
of Johnny Sardine!

56
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:51,990
That'll be two bucks, kid.

57
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:57,460
- A wish-granting fish.
- . Who knew?

58
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,990
My turn. Let's
see... that's it!

59
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,940
Ah! I killed
Johnny Sardine!

60
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:14,080
C'mon, Flint, it's
a sardine, right?

61
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,080
How much trouble can
we possibly get into?

62
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:21,380
Hey-hey-hey! As the Mayor
of Swallow Falls...

63
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:23,990
Sorry, Dad.

64
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,490
I have an announcement to make.

65
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,090
It's Johnny Sardine's
50th birthday!

66
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,560
So if anything
happens to him today,

67
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:38,830
that person or persons are in
BIG TROUBLE! HUGE TROUBLE!

68
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:41,600
So where's the birthday boy?

69
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,370
C'mere you little finny friend.

70
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:45,070
<i>Where are you hiding?</i>

71
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,010
He's uh...

72
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,180
He's teleported to
another dimension!

73
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,250
He got a really
lucrative job offer...

74
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,050
...to that drug store...

75
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,543
...drug store
over... under the water...

76
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,020
...under the bridge...

77
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:57,920
Good thing I'm not
listening to either of you.

78
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:00,560
Yoo-hoo, Johnny!

79
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,990
I have an idea, Sam.

80
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,390
Great, we tell Mayor Shelbourne

81
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,930
that it was all an accident?

82
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,100
No, I'll invent Johnny
Sardine back to life!

83
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:09,860
TO THE LAB! But
first... MAYOR DISTRACTION!

84
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,430
Fine.

85
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,970
Yes I do.
Want an ice cream?

86
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,440
I do, I do want some ice cream! Mmmm.
Little ice cream, little ice cream...

87
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:17,550
So distractingly delicious.

88
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,540
I wasn't finished!

89
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,180
<i>♪ HE WAS A MIGHTY

93
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,400

94
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,670
OVER! OVER!

95
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,200
Not yet, Lab Assistant Steve.

96
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,370
It's not over till
the fat fish fries.

97
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,140
Still looking very dead.

98
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:52,840
Inflating.

99
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,310
Deflating.

100
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:58,210
And... CLEAR!

101
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:01,550
Still dead.

102
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,180
Pickling.

103
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,120
Still dead.

104
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,050
Flambéing!

105
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:06,350
Nope.

106
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,420
And... CLEAR!

107
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,030
He gone.

108
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:12,990
Clear harder!

109
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:17,600
Begging! Please come back,
oh wish-granting sardine.

110
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,470
Johnny, it's me
Flint, we met earlier.

111
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,500
JOHNNY!

112
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,010
It's about time! Wah!

113
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,580
Why don't we just tell
the Mayor the truth?

114
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:34,480
We can't tell anyone. Johnny
Sardine was a fish hero.

115
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,390
Songs were written about him.
Not good ones, but songs!

116
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:41,690
Hey, come on. They
can't all be hits.

117
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,520
He's not smelling so fresh.

118
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,460
I know. I just
wish, I wish...

119
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,460
That's it! I'll just wish Johnny
Sardine back to normal.

120
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,570
I wish for Johnny Sardine
to be good as new.

121
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,600
YOU'RE THE ONE
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS!

122
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:01,080
Responsible for
these shiny floors?

123
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,110
Take a look at those hammies.
Even my pecs are shimmering

124
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:07,580
Whoa, Earl, put those pecs
away before you hurt someone.

125
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,420
Again?

126
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,160
I can't believe anyone buys

127
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,190
this oldest fish
malarkey anyway.

128
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:24,770
Now to collect
all those pennies.

129
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,140
I'm a wish-destroyer.
A dream-crusher.

130
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,710
A hope-squashing
fish-squisher.

131
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,650
Relax. They don't
even know it's us.

132
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,250
I'M GONNA LOCK YOU UP!

133
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,720
Lock you up, good and tight
so no one can steal you!

134
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,420
Such a cute little
bike. Look at that bell.

135
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,290
Bing bing bing bing!

Mmmm, that's some nice scales.

141
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,770
Dad! I'm leaving town!

142
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:09,180
Your son is a nothing
but a sardine-killer.

143
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:11,580
If anyone asks, I loved
that Johnny Sardine

144
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:15,580
like he was my slimey bro. I
tried to save him, Dad. I tried.

145
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:18,650
Uhm... uhm... Gone Fishing.

146
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,120
THIS IS CRIMINAL!

147
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:26,160
Criminal how tasty your ice
cream is.

148
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,460
I only wish my whole body was
a tongue so I could roll up

149
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,470
in this here ice cream and
taste it all over.

150
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,570
I know a guy who can
make that happen.

151
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,040
It's invasive; it's expensive;
and you will regret it.

152
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,580
We can't stay in
Swallow Falls anymore.

153
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,240
We have to put
as much distance between us

154
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,800
and the scene of the
crime as possible.

155
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,180
OK, this'll be fun.

156
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,820
Yeah. We'll get
new identities.

157
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:51,350
Oh, we'll get really
convincing wigs.

158
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,250
We'll change our voices.

159
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:54,760
Invent new laughs.

160
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:55,910
And we'll need cool aliases.

161
00:07:55,930 --> 00:08:00,090
Like, I'll be Rocket Johnson,
and you can be Swamp Worm.

162
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,460
What, no! I don't
wanna be Swamp Worm.

163
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,270
I want to be Rainbow
Mist, Queen of the Clouds.

164
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,270
No no, it's gotta be
tougher, like, Stingray,

165
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,710
or Cobra Strike.
Or Spruce Willis.

166
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,740
I don't wanna be that.

167
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,780
I don't wanna be Spruce
Willis; that's silly.

168
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:16,610
Actually I think
I'll be Cobra Strike.

169
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:18,850
Wait, do you hear something?

170
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,620
MEATBALLS!

171
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:23,520
Who's ready to Party?

172
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:27,190
Uh oh! They're hot
and ready, watch it!

173
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,260
My mouth is willing and open...

174
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,690
They're hot little
nuggets; have some!

175
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:33,330
They've been in
here all day. Whoo!

176
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,530
Whoo!

177
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:38,570
This town is so weird.

178
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,730
C'mon Sam, JUMP!

179
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,240
Agh!

180
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,480
What can I say about Johnny
Sardine? . Not much.

181
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:54,780
But today we celebrate his
50th birthday with respect.

182
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,320
By respect, I mean,
money in the fountain.

183
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,620
Roll in the cake!
2 bucks a slice.

184
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,420
You wanna use a fork,
that's another dollar.

185
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,420
If you wanna use a
spoon, that's 50 cents.

186
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,290
But you have to
buy a fork with it.

187
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,830
Flint Lockwood, and new girl
whose name I can never remember!

188
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,640
Sitting in a cake is pure shenaniganism.
It's Sam.

189
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:18,340
Intolerable by law!

190
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,740
FOR SHAMEITY SHAME SHAME!
Drop and give me twenty!

191
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,880
Flint, we have to
tell the truth!

192
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:25,950
You're right, Sam. Our
days on the lam are over.

193
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,320
No more ruthless renegades
on the run from old man law.

194
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,290
What? We didn't
really run.

195
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,850
We were children
of the universe. What?

196
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,560
...and now we must return.

197
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,890
Thank you, we got it.

198
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:40,390
Mayor Shelbourne,
fellow Swallow Fallians.

199
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:42,460
I'm afraid we killed...

200
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:48,400
Stop the press!
That is not Johnny Sardine.

201
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,370
Boo!

202
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,570
Outrageous!

203
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:51,870
Lies! What's-her-name lies!

204
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,710
The foreign one lies!

205
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,640
No, Sam's right. It's a
Johnny Sardine miracle!

206
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,280
My wish came true!
He's good as new!

207
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,880
But we totally killed him. And
that fish has a moustache.

208
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,750
Oh Sam, don't you see? Johnny
Sardine isn't about facts,

209
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:09,860
or truth, or even facial hair.

210
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:12,590
He's about hope, and
wonder, and believing

211
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:15,730
something good can happen.
Who doesn't want that?

212
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:19,430
The kid's right. Hey, if you
want to cynically believe

213
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:21,970
that I replace Johnny
Sardine every day,

214
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,900
is that what you're
trying to tell me?

215
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:27,240
Is that what's happening now?
Then you just go right ahead.

216
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,380
I mean, here's one
for next Monday.

217
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:32,880
And how about this one
for Thursday?

218
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:37,390
Please. Like I'd do that.

219
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,520
Now it's got an eye
patch and an afro.

220
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,760
Looking good, little fishy.

221
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,390
This town is so weird.

222
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:43,760
Happy Birthday, Johnny Sardine!

223
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:52,500
