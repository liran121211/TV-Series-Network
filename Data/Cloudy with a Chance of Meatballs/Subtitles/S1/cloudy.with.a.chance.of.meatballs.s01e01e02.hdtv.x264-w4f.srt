into science too.

73
00:03:05,286 --> 00:03:08,453
Yeah! I'm
especially into weather.

00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:11,256
Oh, speaking of which,
looks like I'm out of wind.

75
00:03:13,928 --> 00:03:15,194

76

We have so much in common.

77
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:18,897
So weird. t's true!

78
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:21,166
So much. I think we're both
about to plummet though.

going to be friends.

82

Whoa. I don't really do
the friendship thing.

What? But I thought...

84
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:38,250
Um, nope. Now excuse me,
I have some work to do

85

that science fair.

Well, I hate to break it to you,

that science fair.

A lot, actually.

92
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:54,233
Besides, weather isn't
really science per se.

93

What?!

94
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:57,002
It's kind of like a pastime,

95
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:59,538
like duck counting
or witchcraft or...

96
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:00,539

97

the friendship thing.

you about something?

111
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:31,603
It's about a girl.

112
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:35,440
Oh, well, uh,
hm... Girl. Yes. Uuuuh.

113
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:39,544
Well, son, when a little fish
meets another little fish,

114
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:45,117
they're not, they, um, swim
around each other, you know,

115
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:48,086
and they say, "I like
this fish" so they just,

116
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:50,922
life happens, and you
know, time goes by,

117
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,925
and what? More fish.

118
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:55,041
What are you talking about?

119

Just email.

183
00:07:57,244 --> 00:07:59,244
You don't even know him,
honey. He's the mover.

184
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:02,614
Well, what if we agree
that if you have to move

185
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,115
from Swallow Falls,

186
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:06,485
I'll invent the Flint
Lockwood Memory Eraser

187
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,587
and it'll wipe out any
memory of our friendship.

188
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:11,056
That way you won't
have anything to miss.

189
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:12,757
You can do that?

190
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:19,664
I... uh... yeah. For a friend.
So, what do you say? Friends?

191
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:24,269
Friends. By the way, now
that we're not enemies,

192
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:27,539
your wind-powered sound
machine was kinda cool.

193
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:30,742
And your sound-powered wind
thingy wasn't half-bad either.

195
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:33,378
Of course!

196
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:34,713
It's such an obvious plan.

We're number one!

My son, Gil.

227
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,363
WHAT?!

228
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:00,799
For his work in

No, they don't.

Hey! What about us?!

235
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,478
Yeah! We saved
the town.

236
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:14,879
You destroyed the town!

237
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:19,217
Plus, you worked together.
That's cheating.

238
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:24,189
Please. Please. Please.

Oh, fine.

241
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:33,431
Here. It's for... whatever
you want to make it for.

242
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:37,268
Huh, I guess neither of us won.

243
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:38,670
What do you mean?
I clearly won.

244
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:39,671
What?! But-

245
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:42,207
And you did, too. Mayor
Principal Shelbourne

246
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:44,476
said that award could be used
for whatever we wanted.

247
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:47,312
So I'm making it our
official friendship award.

248
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:50,682
We won! We won!
We're number one!

249
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:53,418
Actually Sam, these are
typically used for number two.

250
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:54,619
Ew. You can have it.

251
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:06,631
Sardine slop.

252
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:10,535
Sardine slop or
sardine surprise.

253
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,337
What's the difference?

254
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:13,972
Sardine slop.

255
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,807
Sardine surprise!

256
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,742
Oh! My beautiful face!

257
00:11:17,778 --> 00:11:20,311
You're just lucky
this is so delicious.

258
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:27,585
Sweet! Sardines
again! Jealous?

259
00:11:30,624 --> 00:11:32,957
Do you like what you see?

260
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:34,926
Mmm, nibble nibble
nibble nibble!

261
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,964
Nothing? I thought
you hated sardines.

262
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,733
And what's with the beeps?

263
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:45,437
Of course!
Sam is a cyborg.

264
00:11:45,472 --> 00:11:48,573
It all makes sense now.
Her weird square face.

265
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:50,008
Her rubbery skin.

266
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:53,511
The fact that she beats me in
an arm-wrestle so easily.

267
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:56,781
Maybe I should just ask why
your hands are giggling?

268
00:11:56,817 --> 00:11:58,316
It's nothing!

269
00:11:58,351 --> 00:12:00,752
Oh. Is this one of
those girl things

270
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:02,082
I'm not supposed
No. to know about?

271
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:03,688
No. Like make-up?

272
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:05,490
No. Or "sleep-overs"?

273
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:06,324
Or "feelings"?

274
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:07,092
No.

275
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:08,660
Or asking for
No. directions?

276
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:10,695
Or always asking other
girls for a hair elastic,

277
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:12,864
but it's like, why don't
you ever have one yourself?

278
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,332
I said it's nothing!

279
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:21,005
So it's not so hard to
see why people consider it

280
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,608
one of nature's most
beautiful creatures.

281
00:12:26,113 --> 00:12:27,512
Is it a mind-control
pencil?

282
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:28,613
No.

283
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:29,647
Oh, it's a beard eraser.

284
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:30,782
What, No.

285
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:32,011
Is it a mind-control
beard eraser?

286
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:33,351
A shiny spaceship?

287
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:34,619
It's rhino repellent, right?

288
00:12:34,654 --> 00:12:36,554
Flint Lockwood, is that
you yibber yabbering

289

Cal-aesthetics course?

290
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:40,058
Sorry, Mr. Earl!

291
00:12:44,664 --> 00:12:45,897
Friends don't keep secrets.

292
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:48,967
Which is why I'm going to show
you my weird and hideous rash.

293
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:54,639
No! OK. I will
show you. But no touchies.

294
00:12:54,674 --> 00:12:56,574
OK.

295
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,443
Ha ha ha ha!

296
00:12:58,478 --> 00:13:00,845
It's my Princess Kittymittens.

297
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:03,648
Princess Kittymittens?
What does it do?

298
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:05,383
<i>What doesn't it do?</i>

299
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:06,918
<i>Princess Kittymittens!
Look at it!</i>

300
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,920
<i>Pick it up. Put it
down. Smell it out.</i>

301
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:11,523
<i>Lick it. Eat it!</i>

302
00:13:11,558 --> 00:13:13,892
<i>DO NOT EAT IT!</i>

303
00:13:13,927 --> 00:13:18,630
<i>It's cute! It's
better than friends!</i>

304
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:20,532
<i>than friends. If
ingested, call a doctor.</i>

305
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:23,735
Whoa! It must be loaded up
with some awesome video games.

306
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,503
Nope.

307
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:27,099
Then I assume it's
equipped with its own

308
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:27,867
artificial intelligence?

309
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:29,073
Nuh-uh.

310
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:30,537
Does it interface with
orbiting satellites

311
00:13:30,544 --> 00:13:32,438
to communicate with other
Princess Kittymittenses?

312
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:34,646
Nope. It's just a
Princess Kittymittens!

313
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:36,014
Ooh!

314
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:38,550
NO TOUCHIES!

315
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:43,054
Sorry. It's just... she's
like family.

316
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:46,558
I've moved so many times
and Princess Kittymittens

317
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:50,562
is the one thing that I've
always taken with me.

318
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:54,098
C'mon, just a quick game.

319
00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:56,801
It's not a game! It's

320
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:58,436
Request denied.

321
00:13:58,471 --> 00:13:59,304
Just one
No. round?

322
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,072
C'mon! One level, that's all.
NO!

323
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:02,974
No! No. C'mon just
one, just one...

324
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:03,808
Please...
No.

325
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:05,577
I really wanna try.

326
00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:07,879
I bet I could beat
the whole game!

327
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:09,180
Please!

328
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:12,584
Really?
OKAY! OKAY! YOU WIN!

329
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:15,019
Yes, but only because
you're super annoying.

330
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:16,221
But you have to be-

331
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:18,089
Super careful! Got
it! Nothing's gonna-

332
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:19,457
Uh oh.

333
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:20,558
What happened?

334
00:14:20,594 --> 00:14:22,160
Ha ha ha ha.

335
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,729
Uh, I think I hear
my dad calling!

336
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:26,531
FLINT, it's uh, bedtime!

337
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:29,133
I can't argue with that. BYE!

338
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:31,202
Flint Lockwood,
you get back here

339
00:14:31,238 --> 00:14:33,037
with my Princess Kittymittens!

340
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:38,610
Welding... nailing... taping...
Suppressing guilt...

341
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:39,257
. Aaaaah.

342
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:50,054
Behold, Princess Kittymittens!

343
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:57,128
Busted!

344
00:14:57,163 --> 00:14:59,631
I know, Steve. I know.

345
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:02,166
What am I gonna do, I
gotta fix it, I gotta fi...

346
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:04,869
Sam's my best friend;
what am I gonna do,

347
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:08,539
what am I gonna do, what
am I gonna do... I got it!

348
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:12,543
Planning... tinkering...
flailing!

349
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:15,880
The Vacuu-Brush!

350
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:17,916
Flint, you're panic-inventing.

351
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:22,253
What? Me?
Panicking? Who's panicking?

352
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:24,055
Do I look like I'm panicking?

353
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,124
Like a bucket of
chum in a shark tank.

354
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:28,927
Flint. Flint. Flint!

355
00:15:30,864 --> 00:15:32,964
It's just I borrowed Sam's
Princess Kittymittens

356
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:36,034
cause I wanted to know how it
worked but then I broke it

357
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:37,869
and now Sam's going
to hate me forever

358
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:39,771
and I don't know what to do.

359
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:43,207
Uh, why don't you just
tell her the truth?

360
00:15:43,243 --> 00:15:45,977
You're right! The truth!

361
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:47,679
Aliens from another planet

362
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:49,514
kidnapped your
Princess Kittymittens!

363
00:15:58,825 --> 00:16:01,960
It's a tragedy, I
know. It's... terrible.

364
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:03,823
It's the worst thing that's
ever probably happened

365
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,930
to you maybe, I don't
know there's a lot of...

366
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:09,067
Aliens? ALIENS? You
expect me to believe that?

367
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:11,936
A little bit. OK, so she wasn't
kidnapped.

368
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:15,206
But don't worry, Princess
Kittymittens is definitely

369
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:16,841
not completely destroyed.

370
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:21,646
Completely destroyed?! Flint,
where is my Kittymittens?!

371
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:26,217
OK, OK. But remember,
that I can still fix her.

372
00:16:26,252 --> 00:16:30,688
Probably. Maybe.
But also maybe not.

373
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:39,130
Murderer! You're
a murderer! You are a...

374
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:40,598
Sam, wait...

375
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:43,267
What I... agh.

376
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:47,605
Shame. Shame. Shamity
shame shame shame shame.

377
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:51,376
Shame. Shamity shame
shame shamity shame.

378
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:55,680
Gil, I was doing the shaming.
Get out. You should be ashamed.

379
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:57,849
...and she
just kept screaming.

380
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,754
And calling me a
murderer! Of things,

381
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:05,223
which I didn't even
know could be murdered.

382
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:07,225
Did you tell her the truth?

383
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,261
Absolutely! I mean,
first I lied, obviously.

384
00:17:10,296 --> 00:17:11,929
But eventually I
got to the truth.

385
00:17:11,965 --> 00:17:15,266
Now she thinks we're not
friends. What do I do?

386
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:18,302
You could apologize.

387
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:22,240
First "the truth"
and now "an apology"?

388
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:24,175
You're full of
interesting ideas, Dad!

389
00:17:25,979 --> 00:17:29,947
Bottoms up. Ahhh. Chum.

390
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:40,691
Sam? Can we talk? I,
well, I made you this.

391
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:42,093
Steve.

392
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:44,796
And what is that supposed to be?

393
00:17:44,831 --> 00:17:46,230
It's a replacement Kittymittens!

394
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:47,665
PRETTY.

395
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,802
I think he looks pretty!
So, are we friends?

396
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:55,339
I'm sorry I broke your
toy. Really, I am.

397
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:58,776
Flint, Kittymittens
was very special to me.

398
00:17:58,812 --> 00:18:03,414
Just imagine if I broke,
oh, I don't know, Steve.

399
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,917
That would be terrible!

400
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:07,919
Though I don't know how
you'd break a monkey...

401
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:09,854
Break his spirit, maybe?
Or housebreak him?

402
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:12,323
That would actually be really
great. How would I do that?

403
00:18:12,392 --> 00:18:14,358
I'd have to like
get, like get a tree,

404
00:18:14,394 --> 00:18:16,360
a monkey-friendly tree,
and I'd have to put it,

405
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:18,729
put a toilet by the tree
then every other day

406
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:20,231
I'd have to take
the toilet away.

407
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:20,960
And then eventually...

408
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:22,133
What were we talking about?

409
00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:23,734
Flint...

410
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:27,438
- Right. Me bad, you mad.
- Hey! I know!

411
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:29,240
Because I broke
something of yours,

412
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:30,808
why don't you break
something of mine!

413
00:18:30,844 --> 00:18:32,710
Then you won't be
mad at me anymore

414
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:34,312
and we can be super
best friends again!

415
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:39,016
[sigh[ That actually makes
sense. I accept.

416
00:18:39,052 --> 00:18:42,286
I didn't mean for you
to break my hand... ow!

417
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,892
OK! You can break any
of my precious things,

418
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:49,327
just take your pick!

419
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:51,262
Mmmm... OK... that one.

420
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:52,163
No.

421
00:18:52,198 --> 00:18:53,731
Not that!
That one?

422
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:55,166
Uh, no. Oh, How about that one?

423
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:57,001
Oh, that's That's not
the winner. the winner.

424
00:18:57,036 --> 00:18:59,070
I don't think it is.
Oh that's the winner!

425
00:18:59,105 --> 00:18:59,937
I'm thinking that.

426
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:00,566
I'm thinking not that.

427
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:02,406
Oh, that looks good.

428
00:19:02,442 --> 00:19:04,142
Looks bad to me, though.

429
00:19:04,177 --> 00:19:06,444
How about this? It
means A LOT to me.

430
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,312
I call him Prince
Paperclip and we have

431
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:10,414
lots of crazy
adventures together.

432
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:13,918
What? Nice try.
What about this?

433
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:18,089
Mr. Eureka? He's
my idea bulb!

434
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:20,491
But... I could never
get rid of him!

435
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:24,195
Fine, I'll just dry my tears
with the broken pieces

436
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:27,298
of my Princess Kittymittens.

437
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,368
It's a good choice.

438
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:40,144
I'm going to do it now and
then we're going to be even.

439
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,346
OK? So, here I go.

440
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:46,450
Wait! Let me say goodbye first!

441
00:19:46,486 --> 00:19:48,953
I had so many ideas
under Mr. Eureka.

442
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:51,022
Like my lightning
proof weather balloon,

443
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:53,191
so you could track air-
to-air lightning strikes.

444
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:54,425
Oh, that was pretty cool.

445
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:57,061
Or those automatic
duck legs I made you...

446
00:19:57,096 --> 00:19:59,330
for that stupid duck
parade I signed up for.

447
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,265
Yeah, sorry they never worked.

448
00:20:01,301 --> 00:20:04,936
Or the cloud-punching machine
you said you wished you had...

449
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:07,939
So I could punch the sky
and not feel weird about it.

450
00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:09,440
Yeah.

451
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:12,577
You made all those things
especially for me.

452
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:20,551
Well, I guess you can
break him now.

453
00:20:20,587 --> 00:20:24,388
Awwwww... You can
keep Mr. Eureka.

454
00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:27,058
[gasp] FOR REALSIES?!
YOU'RE THE BEST!

455
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:45,243
Phew. At least Mr.
Eureka didn't...

456
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:51,482
I guess I deserve that.

457
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,221
Flint. I don't need Princess
Kittymittens anymore...

458
00:20:57,257 --> 00:21:00,091
now that I have a best friend.

459
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:03,594
Well, that's really nice.
And whoever that is,

460
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:08,432
I probably won't break it.
Probably. No promises, though.

461
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:10,101
It's you.

462
00:21:10,136 --> 00:21:11,969
Oh right, me!
Of course.

463
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:14,238
Well, I definitely
won't break me!

464
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:16,507
I mean, how would you even
break a Flint Lockwood,

465
00:21:16,542 --> 00:21:18,009
I don't even know how you'd...

466
00:21:18,044 --> 00:21:19,944
Dah!

467
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:26,217
That's how you break
a Flint Lockwood.
