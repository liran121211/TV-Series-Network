1
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,360
Previously on Dystopia.

2
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,670
- Our only hope
lies with the Biocorp

3
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:18,100
scientists finding a
cure for this pandemic.

4
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,840
- We're talking about the
extinction of mankind.

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,870
- He murdered a
Biocorp employee.

6
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:23,870
This is your new target.

7
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,310
- Hit it.

8
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:26,380
- If this is right we're
talking about time travel.

9
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:27,810
- Let me get this straight.

10
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,650
I'm going to become the
president of the United States

11
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:32,050
and be responsible for
the demise of the planet.

12
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:33,570
- You we can go ahead
and release that.

13
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:35,350
- Find who killed my son.

14
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:36,750
- I feel like something's coming

15
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,720
and I may not always
be able to be here.

16
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,430
- Today Noble Peace Prize
winning Biocorp made history

17
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,600
by administering the
cure for cancer available

18
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,100
to the entire world's
population in exchange

19
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,300
for their compulsory enrollment
in the ID chip program,

20
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,740
which allows for increased
population security.

21
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,510
The scheme is said to be
the greatest single stride

22
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:59,810
in medical science
ever achieved.

23
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,810
However, activists have warned
that a chip so fully immersed

24
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:06,620
into our bodies has godlike
control, citing that

25
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,720
something that looks too
good to be true, often is.

26
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:13,660
- Okay get ready.

27
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,230
- Come on.

28
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,330
Come on.

29
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,530
- No not yet.

30
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:23,430
- Come on.

31
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:24,270
- Wait.

32
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:25,100
- Come on, call it.

33
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,100
- Okay now.

34
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,250
- No don't touch her.

35
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,250
- Screaming.

36
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:49,790
- Hello.

37
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,830
What do we have here?

38
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:00,870
When you speak you will say
only what I want to hear.

39
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:03,440
- Please help my friend.

40
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,010
- You will tell me only what

41
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,880
I want to hear and nothing else.

42
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,780
Do you understand?

43
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,080
Good girl.

44
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,890
Those machines, what do they do?

45
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,460
Why are those men
attached to them?

46
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,780
Hey, the machines,
what do they do?

47
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,810
- Leave her alone.

48
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,640
- You son of a.

49
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:46,080
- I told you, you do not say
anything I don't want to hear.

50
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,960
You must not know me.

51
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,560
But you can guess what
I'm capable of, can't you?

52
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,730
Now I'm gonna give
you one more chance.

53
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,970
The machines, what do they do?

54
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:11,980
- Go to hell.

55
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:16,710
- See your little
friend over there?

56
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,790
Would you like me to give
you proof of my resolve?

57
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,510
- I don't think drinking
more wine is gonna help.

58
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:24,080
- I'm not getting
through this without it.

59
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:26,720
Case and point.

60
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,190
- I hate guns.

61
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,620
- Well maybe you'd
learn to appreciate

62
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,890
them more if you
were in a gun fight.

63
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:36,830
- Maybe.

64
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,470
- Do you thinK
the boys are okay?

65
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,540
- I'm sure they are.

66
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,370
Nico will look after them.

67
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:50,610
And I seriously doubt
Thomas is gonna let

68
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:53,140
anything get in his way
of coming home to you.

69
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,310
- What makes you say that?

70
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,950
I don't know what
you're talking about.

71
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,250
- Oh of course you don't.

72
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,560
- What if it's just the
way it's supposed to be?

73
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:14,130
- What, Biocorp
at our doorsteps?

74
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,370
Our men in comas,
theoretically in another time.

75
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:19,200
Um yeah, I'm guessing no.

76
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,800
- No I mean the pandemic.

77
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,470
I mean maybe, maybe we're
all supposed to die off.

78
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,910
You know?

79
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,280
Be extinct.

80
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,850
It happened to the dinosaurs

81
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,420
and maybe it's just
happening to us.

82
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:35,920
- No we're not
going extinct, Lauren.

83
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,220
- What makes you say that?

84
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,860
- Because when people fight

85
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,990
for life there's always hope.

86
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:50,170
- Maybe we're just supposed
to bow out gracefully?

87
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:51,870
- Will you stop
talking like that?

88
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:02,780
I heard that there
are women outside

89
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,380
the city who are still fertile.

90
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,720
They have a natural immunity

91
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,950
to the virus that those
inside the city don't.

92
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:13,290
Their babies live for
more than a few minutes.

93
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:19,560
But they're just so afraid,
they keep it hidden.

94
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,030
Besides, dinosaurs don't have

95
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,930
the brain power to
solve this problem.

96
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,470
We do, they do.

97
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:31,370
They're just trying to scare us.

98
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:33,910
- Sir, they've activated
the emergency power.

99
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:34,740
- Which floor?

100
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,580
- Not sure, sir.

101
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,410
- Well find out!

102
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:37,410
- Sir!

103
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,920
- They're not up there.

104
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,920
They're underground.

105
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,290
Give me the plans for
sewage access tunnels.

106
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:47,920
- Sir.

107
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,130
- Alright, so Phillip
Edier is in charge

108
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:50,690
of the Biocorp soldiers
outside of our home.

109
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:51,960
- Yeah.

110
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,030
You were supposed to
stay with the girls.

111
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,160
- I was.

112
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,630
You don't understand,
they're gonna

113
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,000
cut the power, they're
gonna storm the building.

114
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,200
- There's a backup
generator in the apartment.

115
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,400
- That'll buy us
time, it'll also light

116
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,670
the apartment up like
a Christmas tree.

117
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,510
- Weapons?

118
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,510
- Naw, we got none.

119
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,080
- We should've stayed with
them and now we can't get home.

120
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,880
- We can, we just have
to wait for the window.

121
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,280
- The next window
everybody could be dead.

122
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,520
- Us too.

123
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,180
- No, no, no, guys,
we're gonna save them.

124
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,990
We're gonna save everyone,
we have no choice.

125
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:19,290
- I didn't make you
come here, Nico.

126
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:20,520
- You're right.

127
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,790
All you did was kill
a Biocorp soldier

128
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:23,260
and led them back to our house.

129
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,700
- I'm sorry, next time I'll
just roll over and die.

130
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,000
What else could I do?

131
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,260
- Are you talking
about when you killed

132
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,200
the soldier or when you
executed Jack Williams?

133
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,670
- We don't have time for this.

134
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,100
- You know he's right, there
is actually too much to do.

135
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,710
- No matter what
you have in mind,

136
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:37,470
we all have to be in a
state of induced sleep

137
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,680
at the time the machine in
our time runs out of power.

138
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,140
- Why?

139
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,380
When we tried to bring
you back, you were awake,

140
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,910
you went into arrest,
we almost lost you.

141
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:44,850
- That explains the seizures

142
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:46,220
I had before you got here.

143
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,480
- Best we figure you have to be

144
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,390
asleep to make the trip home.

145
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:51,090
- Well how much time do we have?

146
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:53,220
- Told them to wake
me up in four hours.

147
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,730
- How long before the
emergency power fails?

148
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:56,890
- About the same time.

149
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:57,760
- You sure?

150
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,030
- Yeah.

151
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,500
If they tried to cut
the power out before

152
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,800
we only have about four
hours left in the generator.

153
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,300
- Yeah but this is also assuming

154
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,230
that they don't breach
the building first.

155
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,740
- Right.

156
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:09,710
- So, if we aren't asleep
when they try to revive us,

157
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,540
we all die in cryostasis.

158
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,780
- Great.

159
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,180
So we've got about
four hours to change

160
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,450
the entire future,
otherwise we're all dead.

161
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:20,420
- Thomas, I'm willing to sacrifice
my life to save humanity.

162
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:23,590
- Ah you know what, Nico,
if it's all the same to you

163
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,190
I'd like to save the
world and get home.

164
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,720
- You know we need to
finish what we started

165
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,420
otherwise there's going to
be no home to go back to.

166
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,420
- So what do we do?

167
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,300
- Biocorp headquarters,
it's here.

168
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:40,940
- So the ID chip,
the prototype for it,

169
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,040
if it exists now that's
where it will be?

170
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,270
- Exactly.

171
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,510
So David and I, we're
gonna go there together.

172
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,180
- And do what?

173
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,280
- We're gonna find
it and destroy it.

174
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,750
- What am I doing?

175
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:57,190
- Find the young Phillip Edier,
just do what you have to do.

176
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,560
- Are you asking me to
kill somebody, Nico?

177
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,790
- No I, I can do it.

178
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,160
- No, no, no, it's
okay, I just want to

179
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,190
be sure we know what
we're talking about?

180
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:06,360
- He's outside of our door

181
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,430
in 2037 with an
itchy trigger finger.

182
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:11,400
So do whatever it takes
to protect my family.

183
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,670
So in three hours
and 30 minutes,

184
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,400
meet us back at the
medical hospital.

185
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,400
Don't be late.

186
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:22,950
- You hear that?

187
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,410
They're growing by the minute.

188
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,780
- Yeah there's a
swarm out there.

189
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,020
- We should think about what

190
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,500
we're gonna do when
they come in here.

191
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,440
It's just an old man.

192
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,440
Look.

193
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,010
- Open it, let him in.

194
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,350
- I lost my way in the
dark, may I come in?

195
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,550
- Of course, but hurry please.

196
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,690
- I saw the light
under your door.

197
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,230
- You want to have a seat?

198
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:20,700
Uh, sir, do you
want to have a seat?

199
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,640
- Oh that's nice, thank you.

200
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:34,850
It's just too much out
there, for we wrestle

201
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:39,620
not against flesh and blood,
but spiritual wickedness.

202
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:43,460
I must get back out there
and fight those demons.

203
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:48,160
- You know, maybe you
should just have a seat.

204
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,070
It's cold outside.

205
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,800
We have a blanket,
we could warm you up.

206
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,400
- Oh that's nice, thank you.

207
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:01,210
Thanks.

208
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:09,250
You know it's just too much
out there, for we wrestle

209
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:14,160
not against flesh and blood
but spiritual wickedness.

210
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,460
I must get back out there
and fight those demons.

211
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,390
- Do you want some tea?

212
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,600
It'll warm you up.

213
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,600
- Tea?

214
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,100
Yes.

215
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:27,070
- I think you should stay
here and get strong first.

216
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,240
He seems a bit crazy.

217
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,810
- Well the war did
strange things to people.

218
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:44,490
- How much time do you think
'til the power goes out?

219
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,860
- Um, I don't know exactly.

220
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,190
Probably a few hours.

221
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,200
- Enough time to get them back.

222
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,830
- I hope so.

223
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,680
- There we go.

224
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,980
Huh, alright,
this'll be the best

225
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,420
dressed we've been in awhile.

226
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:18,120
- Ah, it's gonna
be a little tight.

227
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,660
- And I am a thief, I'm
stealing things now.

228
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,630
- Come on Dave.

229
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,000
Alright here's the
Biocorp headquarters,

230
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,230
okay now when we go in.

231
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,670
- You know we really
probably should've

232
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,170
gotten suits if we're gonna
pretend to be bankers.

233
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,640
Which, by the way, I don't
really know about finances,

234
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,440
and I definitely don't know
anything about finances in 2017.

235
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,540
You know in the future they
shoot people who bother them?

236
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,410
They probably do it now too.

237
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:40,410
- David, David!

238
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:42,450
You're gonna blow our cover man.

239
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,150
- Okay, okay.

240
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:46,680
- Just relax, I got this.

241
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,880
- You got this?

242
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,420
You look like you're
in a boy band,

243
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,920
which does fit the time
period, but doesn't really

244
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,490
explain why you're going
in there looking like that.

245
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:52,490
- David.

246
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:58,130
- Okay, okay, okay, you
got this, you got this.

247
00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:58,960
- I got this, alright?

248
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,960
Relax.

249
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,070
- Shouldn't you shave at least?

250
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,200
- Okay, okay, this is good,
this is good, this is good.

251
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,160
My friend's gonna die,
gonna be stuck in the past.

252
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,150
- Hello, how may I assist you?

253
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:22,190
- Ah yeah, hi what's your name?

254
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,020
- Monica.

255
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,350
- Monica, nice name.

256
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,750
- Thank you.

257
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,120
- I am a venture capitalist
and I need to speak

258
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,230
to someone about investing
in your amazing company.

259
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:33,230
- Sure, sure.

260
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:37,370
- Thank you.

261
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:00,860
- Crap!

262
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,100
You okay?

263
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,600
Alright.

264
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,700
Hey, word of advice kid,
football's on its way out.

265
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,970
Learn how to shoot a gun.

266
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:19,810
- Hello sir, how are you doing?

267
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:21,010
Sara Washington.

268
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:23,110
- Hey I'm great, uh Paul Little.

269
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,350
- Wonderful, right this way,

270
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,510
I'm gonna give you a
tour of our facility.

271
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,420
- Okay, that's
really nice of you.

272
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,920
- Oh it's my pleasure.

273
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,950
I just happen to believe
in Biocorp very strongly.

274
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:33,960
I have passion in
everything we do here.

275
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,190
- That's great.

276
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,130
- It really is a
wonderful company.

277
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:38,060
- That's really good to hear.

278
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,470
- Phillip.

279
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,470
- Huh?

280
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,970
- I'm afraid I can't
answer that either, sir.

281
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:59,580
- So, how am I suppose to invest

282
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,850
if you're not willing
to talk about anything?

283
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:06,080
There's plenty of
information about Biocorp

284
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,480
readily available to
serious investors.

285
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,480
- Oh serious.

286
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,020
What about government contracts,
can you tell me about that?

287
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,690
You know, up and coming
projects, new ventures.

288
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:17,990
- I'm afraid I can't
disclose any information

289
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:20,130
about our company's
R&D contacts.

290
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,060
- Alright.

291
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,270
- You must understand that many

292
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,270
are of a commercially
sensitive nature.

293
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,470
- Mm hmm.

294
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,500
- As I'm sure you can imagine.

295
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,800
- Yeah.

296
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,400
- I can tell you, however,

297
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,740
we have an entire floor dedicated
to R&D of various forms.

298
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,280
But as to who our
clients are, sir,

299
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,280
that's proprietary information.

300
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,650
- Well can I get a sneak
peak of the R&D wings?

301
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:41,220
No details, I just want
a quick look, that's it.

302
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,320
- Will you excuse
me for a moment?

303
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,320
I'll be right back.

304
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:46,850
- Right.

305
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,410
- I apologize about this, sir,

306
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:11,980
but asking questions
of a sensitive nature

307
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,550
has tripped our security
director's interest.

308
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,950
I'm afraid we'll have to detain
you for a short while whilst

309
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:21,390
we establish identity and
validate your queries as genuine.

310
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,790
I assure you that
these gentlemen

311
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:25,190
will keep you more than
comfortable as you wait.

312
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,000
- If you can come with us, sir.

313
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Now.

314
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,240
- Hey guys can I tie my shoe?

315
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,950
I just gotta tie
my shoe real quick.

316
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:55,890
Okay, okay, see, not doing
anything, not doing anything.

317
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,240
Where is it?

318
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,540
Where's the chip, chip, chip?

319
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,670
Oh this is it.

320
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,510
Oh my gosh.

321
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,720
They're already in production.

322
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,460
This must be an earlier version,

323
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:31,260
this is way bigger than
the one in my body.

324
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,100
Hard drive.

325
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,100
Hard drive.

326
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,340
Got it.

327
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:47,810
- We have a security breach.

328
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,210
- Let's go.

329
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,350
Copy.

330
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:57,750
Okay.

331
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:00,120
Come on, come on.

332
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,590
Come on, come on, come on.

333
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,500
Come on, come on.

334
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,500
Got it.

335
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,840
- Get me security.

336
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,840
- Hey they didn't shoot you.

337
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,710
- No, no, I'm good.

338
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:23,550
- That's good.

339
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,980
- How about you?

340
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,220
- You know I think I
would've been a good dad.

341
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,550
- Alright, tell
me about it later.

342
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:28,550
- Begin.

343
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,390
- You should just tell Nico.

344
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:39,700
- Tell him what?

345
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:45,900
I don't think my
brother would approve.

346
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,700
- He is your brother, exactly,

347
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,970
he just wants you to
be happy, he loves you.

348
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:55,410
- Jenny, the
emergency power is running low.

349
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:56,880
You have two hours remaining.

350
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:00,420
- You girls seem
worth fighting for.

351
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:05,320
You remind me of how my
wife used to look at me.

352
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,320
- Oh yeah, where is she?

353
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,690
- Heaven.

354
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:11,530
If you believe in
that sort of thing.

355
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:16,200
You know it's hard
losing the one person

356
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,540
that was made just for you.

357
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:29,210
- I think the power's going out.

358
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:33,420
- Ah that's just her,
she does that sometimes.

359
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,460
Well, I want to thank you ladies

360
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:42,090
for all of your hospitality.

361
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:44,730
Now it's time for me to go.

362
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:49,430
I need to get back out
there, there's something I'm

363
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:54,400
supposed to do but I just can't
quite remember what it is.

364
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,140
- Why don't you stay until
the main power comes back on?

365
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,040
I can make you more
tea if you want.

366
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,050
- It's good tea.

367
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:06,680
But my bladder's not as strong
as it used to be, I'm afraid.

368
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,990
- Oh come on, we have
a bathroom right there.

369
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:10,990
- You're too kind.

370
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:19,590
- Poor guy.

371
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,570
I couldn't imagine
loving Nico that long

372
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:26,470
and then just losing
him, you know?

373
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,040
- I'm sure he'll be okay.

374
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,340
You're survivors.

375
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,610
- Lauren I don't
want you to die here.

376
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:40,750
Nico would want you to
try to at least get out.

377
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,650
- Nico would want
me to stay with you.

378
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,220
- They're coming for him.

379
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,790
- They're coming for all of us.

380
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,960
Besides, where else would I go?

381
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:07,180
- Please, don't hurt me.

382
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:09,210
- Shut up.

383
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,520
Shut up!

384
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:18,190
All I have to do to save my
whole world is pull the trigger.

385
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:21,460
- I haven't done
anything, I'm just a kid.

386
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,730
- You will.

387
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:26,230
You will.

388
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:28,330
You are going to cause so
many people so much pain.

389
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,530
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

390
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:33,570
- But if I pull the trigger,

391
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:36,000
the ripples may make things
worse where I'm from.

392
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,280
The butterfly effect,
you see, we don't know.

393
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,180
Broad brush strokes,
they're too much.

394
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:48,850
The future, the future
needs a finer touch.

395
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:51,120
- I don't know what the hell

396
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,390
you're talking about
or who you are.

397
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:55,260
Please, please let me go.

398
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:58,930
- Shut up, Phillip, because
I'm gonna try and help you.

399
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,060
I'm gonna give you a chance
to do the right thing,

400
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,930
to make the right choice,

401
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:06,870
so that our future
really is in your hands.

402
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:08,840
- Please, my dad has money.

403
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,710
- I don't want your
father's money.

404
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:14,010
Don't you get that?

405
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:14,840
Don't you get that?

406
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,710
I want my future back.

407
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:20,680
- I don't know what the
hell you're talking about.

408
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,550
- Do you believe in time travel?

409
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,490
You will.

410
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:33,860
Because if I fail,
many years from now,

411
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:36,030
you and I are going
to come face to face

412
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:38,500
and you remember my face,
you take a good look,

413
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,040
because I won't have
aged a single day.

414
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:43,040
Look at my face.

415
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,470
- You're crazy.

416
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,640
- Where I'm from,
in a world you can't

417
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,610
possibly comprehend,
everything's crazy.

418
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:56,650
All hope is gone, because
people like you took it away.

419
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:01,060
And I'm not gonna stand here
and watch my future end.

420
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:14,670
But I am gonna stick
to the mission.

421
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:16,200
- What are you doing?

422
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,370
- I'm gonna give you a way
to remember me, real easy,

423
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:21,810
you look at my
face as I do this.

424
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,430
I'll see you again, Phillip.

425
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,040
- How much time do we have?

426
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:53,880
- Less than five minutes.

427
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,140
- Oh gosh.

428
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,750
Are you sure this is the
right medical facility.

429
00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:00,050
- Yeah, it was here when
I was 10, broke my leg.

430
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:01,050
Lots of ice cream.

431
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:05,450
- David, Thomas should've
been here by now.

432
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:07,690
- Well, what if he.

433
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:08,720
- No, no, no, no,
he's fine, he's fine,

434
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,130
he can take care of himself.

435
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:14,100
- Alright, we need to
find someplace secluded.

436
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,030
- Why?

437
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,570
- Because we gotta go to sleep.

438
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:19,940
Which, by the way, really not
sure I'm gonna be able to do.

439
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,500
- I got an idea, follow me.

440
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,840
What is this place?

441
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,040
- It's a simulation center.

442
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,310
Yeah, doctor's used to
use these to practice on.

443
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,420
It's not creepy at all.

444
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,650
- Yeah.

445
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:36,050
Alright, what are we
looking for again?

446
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:38,050
- Chloroform or any good
anesthetic should do the trick.

447
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:38,920
- It's probably in there.

448
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,320
- Yes, yes, okay.

449
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,320
This is weird.

450
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,890
- What do we got, what
do we got, come on.

451
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:47,000
- I'll look over here.

452
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:52,970
Ah here we go.

453
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:53,800
- What do we got?

454
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,670
Perfect.

455
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:55,670
Okay.

456
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:58,940
- Come on Thomas, come on.

457
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,080
- We're running out of time.

458
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,580
- We can't leave Thomas, man.

459
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,550
- He could've put
himself to sleep already.

460
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:05,010
Look we can't wait for him,

461
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:06,950
otherwise we're gonna get stuck
here or we're gonna be dead.

462
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:08,380
- Fine let's get it ready.

463
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,220
If he comes, he comes.

464
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,190
- Yep.

465
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:11,420
- If not then we'll have to put

466
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,350
ourselves under and
hope he did the same.

467
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,350
- Okay.

468
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,420
- You're sure this
is gonna work?

469
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,990
- No, but it's the
only choice we got.

470
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:20,030
- Alright well try
it on me first.

471
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,500
- No, no, no, it's me first.

472
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,030
The girls know to
wake me up first,

473
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,130
that's why I'm on the clock.

474
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:25,400
- Well what if it doesn't work?

475
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,640
- Well then they won't
wake up you or Thomas.

476
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,810
- Well what so we're
here and you're dead?

477
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:31,040
- Or stuck here with you.

478
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,880
Either way this is the
only choice we got.

479
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,080
- Just do it on me first.

480
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,310
- No we can't do
it like that, Nico.

481
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,540
- I'm not letting
you risk your life.

482
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:39,010
- Look I'd risk my life
for you any day, okay?

483
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:40,280
- Look stop being dramatic,

484
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,450
just, let's do it
at the same time.

485
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:42,280
Let's go.

486
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,820
- Alright, alright.

487
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:46,890
Sorry, pal, can't argue
with you on this one.

488
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:51,730
- Dammit, David.

489
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:53,460
- Oh man I hate needles.

490
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,440
- Out of time.

491
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,750
Welcome back, David.

492
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,110
- Nico.

493
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:13,580
- It worked.

494
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,780
- No, no, no, no, no, not yet!

495
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,290
- Why!?

496
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:19,390
- He's, he's not asleep yet,
he's still waiting for Thomas.

497
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:21,560
- No, no, they're
here, they're here.

498
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,990
- We can't stay here.

499
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:25,590
- We have to give them
more time to put themselves

500
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:28,300
into stasis before we wake
them up or it'll kill them.

501
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,470
- What happened there?

502
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:33,500
- We got split up,
Thomas was supposed

503
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,970
to meet us, he never showed.

504
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:37,470
- No, no, no, no, wait look,
look, he's still alive,

505
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,940
his brain activity's still high.

506
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:42,810
- Okay where was mine
when we walked through?

507
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:44,280
- Just right here.

508
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,350
- Okay so that's obviously
where sleep patterns kick in.

509
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,750
We need to wait until
their brain activity

510
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:50,320
is where mine was
before we wake them up.

511
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,550
- What about Nico, is he okay?

512
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:53,820
- He's fine, he's
fine, so is Thomas.

513
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,790
We were all together,
we just got split up.

514
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:57,030
- Oh thank god.

515
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,590
I can't believe
you were in 2017.

516
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:01,200
- Yeah, yeah it's beautiful.

517
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,430
- That's crazy.

518
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,300
- Did you change anything?

519
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,600
- Nothing you want
to know about.

520
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,670
For all I know it
made things worse.

521
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:08,940
- Worse?

522
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,110
How would we know
if it were worse?

523
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,310
If you changed
something the ripple

524
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,270
would be part of our
present, always with us.

525
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,310
- Ripples indeed.

526
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,650
- Who is that?

527
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:20,010
- Don't worry about him, he
came in the blackout, he's fine.

528
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,160
What, what, what's so funny?

529
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,720
- It worked.

530
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:34,160
They did it, they
invented time travel.

531
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,230
And I'm the guy who got to go
and come back in one piece.

532
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,370
- I wouldn't rely on being
in one piece for too long.

533
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:51,610
They're getting closer.

534
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:53,080
- Can we move them?

535
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,020
- No they need to stay
hooked up to the machine.

536
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:54,680
- Then we need to wake them up.

537
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,880
- You can't.

538
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,820
- The power source
is almost out.

539
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,290
- Look we have to risk it.

540
00:28:58,290 --> 00:28:59,690
Either the Biocorp soldiers are
gonna burst through the door

541
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:00,720
or the power's going out.

542
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,890
Either way, they'll die.

543
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:02,830
We have to pull them back.

544
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:03,630
- No, you'll kill them.

545
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:04,860
- Let go of me.

546
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:05,690
- No wait.

547
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:06,930
- No.

548
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:08,200
- Jen, Jen, just wait.
- No, let go of me.

549
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,000
- You have to wait,
give them more time,

550
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,930
he will find Thomas.

551
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:12,370
- Please, I can't lose Nico.

552
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:15,500
- You won't, Nico's a survivor.

553
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,870
But if you do this he is dead.

554
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:20,580
- They're on the floor above us.

555
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:23,680
- Okay, okay, okay, is
there another way out?

556
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,910
- Maybe through the
sewers, but I don't know.

557
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:27,150
- No, no, no, we're
not leaving them.

558
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:29,850
- Alright I'll stay, I'll
stay, and I'll wake them up.

559
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,650
- What happens then?

560
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:33,890
- Then we'll find you.

561
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:35,360
We can find you.

562
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,190
Look I swore to Nico I'd
keep you safe, both of you.

563
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:40,730
Please just go.

564
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,270
- I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry.

565
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:52,540
- Where the hell were you, man?

566
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,080
- I was busy with
our mutual friend.

567
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,640
- Did you kill him?

568
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,010
- Where's David?

569
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:00,010
- He's gone.

570
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:02,850
- What do you mean gone?

571
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:04,120
It worked?

572
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,450
- He just disappeared
right in front of me.

573
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:07,590
- That's incredible.

574
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:08,420
- It's crazy.

575
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,420
- So we can go home.

576
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:13,030
- So what did you do with Edier?

577
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:13,860
- I'll explain later.

578
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:14,700
- No, no, wait, wait.

579
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,900
What'd you do?

580
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,770
- I gave him a
chance okay, Nico?

581
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:19,230
- You let him go?

582
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:21,200
- Nico, I'm sorry, okay, I
didn't want to kill him, Nico.

583
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,240
- Oh my god, Thomas.

584
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,670
- I'm sorry.

585
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:24,940
- What, you killed Jack
Williams like that, and then.

586
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,340
- Yeah and look how that
turned out for us, okay?

587
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,310
Remember the butterfly effect?

588
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,980
That doesn't work.

589
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,850
- Oh my gosh, Thomas.

590
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:31,850
- I know, I know.

591
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:32,650
- All you had to
do was kill him.

592
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:33,580
The siege is done.

593
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,050
- We don't know that, okay Nico?

594
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:36,990
He could've been replaced
by somebody worse.

595
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:38,890
Somebody that wanted to
bomb the whole building.

596
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:40,860
- Look Thomas we have
a little bit of time

597
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,490
to make a big impact
to avoid the future.

598
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:43,790
- I know, I know, I know,

599
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:47,030
but is that what you
did at Biocorp, huh?

600
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,530
No.

601
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:50,530
Let me guess, broad brush
strokes, it don't work, right?

602
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:51,830
Come on we know that.

603
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:52,530
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I
know, I remember that,

604
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:54,770
but come on man.

605
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,500
You killed Jack Williams
with no hesitation

606
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,110
and now you're trying
to do the right thing

607
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,510
because you think you
understand the butterfly effect.

608
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:01,480
- I didn't say I understood,
okay, I didn't say

609
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,850
I understood, I said
I gave him a chance.

610
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:05,180
I left him with such a lasting

611
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,880
impression of me that
he will never forget.

612
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,220
When he sees my face
in 20 years from now,

613
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,490
he is not gonna forget.

614
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:13,390
And he's gonna believe
in time travel, Nico.

615
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:14,790
He's gonna do the right thing.

616
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,130
- How do you know?

617
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,160
How do you know that?

618
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,100
- I don't.

619
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,030
- Do you know what he becomes?

620
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,330
Do you?

621
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:25,570
- No.

622
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:26,730
- And we won't know
until we go back.

623
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:28,670
- Okay so we should
just go back.

624
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:30,170
Or we can stand here
for another hour

625
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:33,340
and talk about it whilst
we leave the girls alone.

626
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:36,140
- Let's go.

627
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:41,120
- What is it?

628
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,420
- They've activated the signal.

629
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:44,340
They're getting ready to
put themselves to sleep.

630
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,990
Candles, blow out the candles.

631
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:51,830
Okay get ready.

632
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,360
- Come on, come on.

633
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,140
- No not yet.

634
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:01,970
- Come on, come on, come on.

635
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:02,800
- Not yet, Jenny.

636
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,110
- Come on.

637
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:05,110
- Wait.

638
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:07,510
- Come on, call it.

639
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,510
- Wait.

640
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:14,020
- Is this gonna work?

641
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:17,420
- I dunno, it worked for David.

642
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,720
- Well how do we know?

643
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,650
How do we know that
David just didn't

644
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:21,120
simply blip out of existence?

645
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:23,690
- We don't.

646
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:25,590
- Brilliant.

647
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,460
- It's now or never.

648
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:33,740
- Now, now.

649
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:36,970
- About time.

650
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:49,050
- No, don't touch her.

651
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,450
- Lauren!

652
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:01,930
- Hello.

653
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,070
What do we have here?

654
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:14,580
When you speak you will say
only what I want to hear!

655
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,580
- Please help my friend.

656
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,080
- You will tell me only what

657
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,950
I want to hear and nothing else.

658
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:23,250
You understand?

659
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:24,250
Hmm?

660
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,720
Good girl.

661
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:35,960
Those machines, what do they do,

662
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,630
and why are those
men attached to them?

663
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,840
Hmm?

664
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,150
Hey the machines,
what do they do?

665
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:52,250
- Leave her alone.

666
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,880
- I told you.

667
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:00,160
Now I'm gonna give
you one more chance.

668
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:05,060
The machines, what do they do?

669
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,060
- Go to hell.

670
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,870
- You see your little
friend over there?

671
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:17,340
Would you like me to give
you proof of my resolve.

672
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:20,380
- Phillip Edier!

673
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:31,690
- Can I help you, grandpa?

674
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:34,220
- Take a closer look

675
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:38,860
and remind yourself
of what you once knew.

676
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:47,270
- Lauren.

677
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:04,820
- It can't be.

678
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:07,590
I know you.

679
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:15,500
You called it the
butterfly effect.

680
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,440
You said you wouldn't change.

681
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:32,710
It's been 20 years and
I remember your face.

682
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:37,690
You haven't aged a day.

683
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:38,920
- Don't touch him.

684
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:45,590
Time travel.

685
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:53,070
- Please, she's going to die!

686
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:54,900
- Get that woman
medical attention.

687
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:55,740
- Sir.

688
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:56,740
- Stabilize her.

689
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,680
Well how does this
wonderful machine work, hmm?

690
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,780
Bring in a science team.

691
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:08,850
- Yes, sir.

692
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:15,790
- Emergency power
failing, system shutting down.

693
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,390
- Wait, you, leave her.

694
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:26,230
If you want your two
friends to survive,

695
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:27,740
you better tell me everything.

696
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:31,040
- Turn the power back
on or you get nothing.

697
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:33,210
- I'll just let her die.

698
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:39,880
- Go ahead, kill us all,
then you'll have no answers.

699
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,520
- Start talking.

700
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:46,790
- Power.

701
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,730
- Main power to the
building, turn it back on.

702
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:58,770
- Yes, sir.

703
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:06,740
- System power restored.

704
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,380
- Start talking.

705
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:14,250
- What is it you want to know?

706
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:23,660
- Those men, where are they?

707
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:25,660
Or rather when are they?

708
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:39,040
- Hey you can't sleep here.

709
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,910
Hey, I need some help.

710
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:49,580
Two guys, I think they're dead.

711
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:53,990
- Page Dr. Mangan.

712
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,360
- That's magnificent,
such potential.

713
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:05,070
- We're all though here, sir.

714
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,270
- She'll survive?

715
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:07,740
- She's as good as new.

716
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:14,510
- The boys are okay,
they miss you very much.

717
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,380
- You hear that?

718
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,680
They're gonna be okay,
you're gonna be okay.

719
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:22,680
How are you feeling?

720
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:25,650
- I'm okay.

721
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,390
- Time to wake up.

722
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:33,760
There you go, that's
it open your eyes.

723
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,260
That's it.

724
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,380
There you go, come on back,
come on back, you're safe.

725
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,800
Welcome back to reality.

726
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:48,940
- Where am I?

727
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:51,610
- You're in a hospital.

728
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:53,520
You were found unconscious.

729
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,020
You remember how you got here?

730
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,150
- What year is it?

731
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,890
- What year do you think it is?

732
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,990
- What are these for?

733
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:05,760
- Those are for
your own protection.

734
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:14,870
- Where am I?

735
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,440
- You're okay.

736
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:20,580
- I'm dreaming?

737
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:22,980
- Yes, you're dreaming.

738
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,980
But you have to wake up.

739
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:28,780
- I don't want to wake up.

740
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:32,420
I want to stay here with you.

741
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,920
- I want to stay too.

742
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,930
But you have to help Nico.

743
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:46,270
Wake up.

744
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:48,030
- No.

745
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,680
- Good morning.

746
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:58,950
- What is this?

747
00:39:58,950 --> 00:39:59,780
- It's okay.

748
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,120
You've had a seizure.

749
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,720
- Why am I tied up?

750
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,320
Where am I?

751
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,060
- You're in the hospital.

752
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,320
- What?

753
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,600
- The doctor will be right here.

754
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:17,430
- Nico.

755
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:19,430
No wait, my friend Nico.

756
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:20,430
Hello?

757
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,080
- Can you tell me your name?

758
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,440
- Why am I tied down?

759
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,510
- You had a seizure.

760
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:35,450
This tattoo, it's
very interesting.

761
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:38,090
This bracelet, the material,

762
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:40,920
I've never seen
anything like it before.

763
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:45,230
So can you tell me your name?

764
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:48,230
- How long have I been here?

765
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:49,230
- Since last night.

766
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:52,030
You had a strong
tranquilizer in you.

767
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:54,440
So strong you're
lucky you're alive.

768
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,810
- I guess I over did it.

769
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:00,610
- You did this to yourself?

770
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:02,280
- Look, you wouldn't understand.

771
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,480
- I understand that you

772
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,680
and your friend are
both lucky to be alive.

773
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,680
- Where is he?

774
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:07,810
- He's safe.

775
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:09,720
- Excuse me Dr. Mangan,

776
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,620
you're needed in the other room.

777
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:14,290
- Okay get some rest.

778
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:15,990
I'll come back and
check up on you later.

779
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:22,560
- We didn't want to hurt anyone.

780
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,530
Such an unpleasant
waste of time.

781
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:29,140
We could all help each other.

782
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:33,170
We could help the world.

783
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:39,110
I'll guarantee your
freedom if you tell me what

784
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:43,520
your friends are up to or I
can just shoot you one by one.

785
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,020
- That's not necessary.

786
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:55,130
- Then speak up.

787
00:41:57,330 --> 00:41:59,300
- We were just trying
to save the world.

788
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:03,910
- Is that all?

789
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:07,510
I'm listening.

790
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:17,750
- Mike, is it?

791
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,590
- Yeah um, Michael Smith.

792
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:23,520
- So where are you from, Mike?

793
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,730
- Uh Pennsylvania.

794
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:26,660
I uh.

795
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:27,930
- Your eyes blurry?

796
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:29,100
- Yeah.

797
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:30,260
- I'll get the
nurse to hook you up

798
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:31,780
with an IV, help
flush out your system.

799
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:35,170
- How much longer do
I have to be here?

800
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:37,810
- Relax, I need to find
out who you are first.

801
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,140
Speaking of.

802
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:45,680
- Michael Smith?

803
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:50,620
- What are you doing?

804
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:53,250
- Just trying to
figure out who you are.

805
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:55,660
Don't worry, we'll get
you back where you belong.

806
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:02,000
- We're trying to avert
the chipdemic virus

807
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,270
that has doomed our
planet to extinction.

808
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:07,270
- It's true, everything
he speaks of.

809
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:09,340
- Who are you anyway?

810
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:10,810
- He's harmless.

811
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:12,970
- I wouldn't say harmless now.

812
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:15,680
- Before you start
trying to save the world,

813
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,010
how many trips
have they been on?

814
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:20,980
- None.

815
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:22,150
- None?

816
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:24,450
Oh well that is
interesting and brave.

817
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:28,190
For all you know
there is no way back.

818
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:29,190
- I got back.

819
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,230
I got back.

820
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:39,700
- And did you have any success
in changing the future?

821
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:43,840
- I honestly don't know, I
don't know what they've done.

822
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,240
- What did you do?

823
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:50,240
- I don't know what changes
have been made if any.

824
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,580
We might not know
'til they get back,

825
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:53,010
we might never know.

826
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:56,180
Everything's in a
state of temporal flux

827
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:58,590
until the link we've
created is severed.

828
00:43:58,590 --> 00:44:00,860
It's only when the tunnel is
closed that we'll actually

829
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:03,660
see the full effect of the
changes that were made.

830
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:05,890
- But you were in the past?

831
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:09,060
- I was.

832
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,940
- I want to go there myself.

833
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:16,200
- You could get lost forever

834
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,710
if you don't know
what you're doing.

835
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:19,110
- Well that's why you gotta
make things smooth for me.

836
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:20,610
- I can't assure that.

837
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,280
- If anything goes wrong, everyone
in this room is executed.

838
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,780
- What, what, what happens
if you get yourself

839
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:29,620
killed back there,
that's not our fault.

840
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:31,420
Spare the girls at least.

841
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:33,290
- Make it work and
you'll have no problems.

842
00:44:33,290 --> 00:44:34,520
- It's not that easy.

843
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,820
- Then make it easy!

844
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:38,860
Or I'll make it hard,
beginning with her!
