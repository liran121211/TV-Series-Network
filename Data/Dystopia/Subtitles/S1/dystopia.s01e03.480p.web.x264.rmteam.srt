1
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:13,100
Previously on Dystopia.

2
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,200
- Those
machines, what do they do?

3
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,700
- Find the young Philip Edier.

4
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:21,340
I'm gonna give you a
way to remember me.

5
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,270
- Biocorp,
headquarters, it's here.

6
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:25,210
- So, the ID chip,
the prototype for it.

7
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:27,980
- The girls know
to wake me up first,

8
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,280
that's why I'm on the clock.

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,250
- You girls seem
worth fighting for.

10
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,080
- You're in the hospital.

11
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,050
- What, what year is it?

12
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:36,150
- What year do you think it is?

13
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:37,590
- I wanna go there myself.

14
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:38,860
- It's not that easy.

15
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:40,260
- Then make it easy!

16
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:46,230
- And finally,
tonight's top story.

17
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,600
Today, Nobel Peace Prize
winning Biocorp made history

18
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,000
by administering
the cure for cancer,

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,200
available to the entire
world's population

20
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,370
in exchange for their
compulsory enrollment

21
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,580
in the ID chip
program, which allows

22
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,840
for increased
population security.

23
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,980
Biocorp's CEO stated,
"It takes a brave man

24
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,350
"to knock on the
door of evolution

25
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:07,820
"without knowing what
lies on the other side.

26
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,020
"But we've taken
the first brave step

27
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,290
"to improving our
children's future today.

28
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:13,920
"Go through the door
and what awaits you

29
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,990
"on the other side is
something worth fighting for."

30
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,000
- Why don't you just
kill us all now?

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,270
Huh?

32
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:26,700
Kill us now, kill
us all, go ahead.

33
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,970
- I need to undo the
damage they've done.

34
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:31,910
Who gave these men the right

35
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:34,010
to change the course of history?

36
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,180
Who made them gods?

37
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,880
- So what, now you're
gonna play God?

38
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,020
- They're trying to save us all.

39
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,320
If you stop what they started,

40
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,290
we're all doomed to extinction.

41
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,330
- You mean your friend, Thomas?

42
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:49,760
Let me tell you about him.

43
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,500
20 years ago he kidnapped
me, he held a gun

44
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,330
to my head and he cut
this into my neck!

45
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,130
So don't pretend
that I'm the bad man

46
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:00,470
in some pathetic
childhood story.

47
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:04,270
I didn't want the
world to end like this!

48
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:09,850
But from my perspective they've
always been in the past.

49
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:13,350
So how the hell do I know that
they didn't cause all this?

50
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,020
- You heard her.

51
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,250
They're trying to save us all.

52
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,420
- This sort of power shouldn't
be reserved for just anyone.

53
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,230
- Then you're okay
with this power?

54
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,300
- Of course, I am a
government official.

55
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,930
- It's your government that
caused it in the first place!

56
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,840
- That's why I trust you'll
never let anything happen to me.

57
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:34,900
Because without me they will die

58
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,970
and you'll never know
if you can be saved.

59
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:40,980
- The Butterfly Effect
works both ways.

60
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,610
- What's that you're
saying, Grandpa?

61
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,680
- Time's not an arrow
always going forward.

62
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,590
The ripples can travel
forward or backward.

63
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,250
- I'll bear that
in mind, Grandpa.

64
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,960
Cut him loose.

65
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,680
- You'll need to wear this.

66
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,010
- What is it?

67
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:17,150
- It's how we get you back.

68
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,250
This lets us monitor
your condition

69
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,650
as well as tell
you when you are.

70
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:25,590
You ping it here, it
sends us the signal,

71
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,360
and we bring you back.

72
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,500
So don't lose it.

73
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,830
I don't know what
your intentions are,

74
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:41,340
but please, for the
sake of mankind,

75
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,310
keep in mind that for every
catalyst there is a reaction.

76
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,850
For every cause
there's an effect.

77
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,250
- I'm counting on it.

78
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,420
Let's get on with it.

79
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:49,570
- I hope that every American,

80
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:51,480
regardless of where he lives,

81
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,210
will stop and examine
his conscience.

82
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,780
This nation was founded by men

83
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,280
of many nations and backgrounds.

84
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,250
It was founded on the principle

85
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,550
that all men are created equal.

86
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:05,460
And that the rights of
every man are diminished

87
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,920
when the rights of one
man are threatened.

88
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:11,960
Today we are committed
to a worldwide struggle

89
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,360
to promote and
protect the rights

90
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,700
of all who wish to be free.

91
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,840
In short, every American
ought to have the right

92
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,810
to be treated as he
would wish to be treated.

93
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:26,310
As one would wish his
children to be treated.

94
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,610
But this is not the case.

95
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,720
- Come in.

96
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:40,620
- Sorry to disturb
you, sir, madam,

97
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,830
but there seems to be
a situation developing.

98
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,560
- What is it, the Chinese?

99
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,800
- No, sir, it's domestic.

100
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,430
The details are
few at this point,

101
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,470
but it seems there's
been an attack on

102
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:52,470
a Biocorp officer and
a seige is developing.

103
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,410
- A siege?

104
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:57,440
- Apparently, a group of
rogue scientists have killed

105
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,910
a Biocorp officer
and they have...

106
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:03,750
- Have what?

107
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,480
- Well sir, they seem to have
built a machine of some type.

108
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,820
No one knows what it
does, but it seems people

109
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,820
are hooked up to it, the
scientists themselves.

110
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,960
- And that's all we know?

111
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,360
- Yes, sir.

112
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,860
- Well, who's in
charge down there?

113
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,430
- The local officer
on the scene.

114
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:21,200
Apparently, they breached
the building and he's inside.

115
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,700
- You get yourself
a regional commander

116
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,030
out there right away.

117
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:24,970
- Yes, sir.

118
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,970
- Before this thing escalates.

119
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,770
Find out who they are
and why they're there.

120
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,270
- Yes, Mr. President.

121
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,270
- Okay.

122
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,090
- Adam, run program.

123
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:51,630
- Program initiated, David.

124
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:54,930
- That's it.

125
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:56,500
He's a time traveler.

126
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,600
Hey, hey, can I check on them?

127
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:46,220
I can kill Philip by
severing the upload link.

128
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,950
The guards won't
know the difference.

129
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,820
It'll just look like
he's still asleep.

130
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,250
- What do you think?

131
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,720
- I think that they
would find out eventually

132
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,720
and if we're not out of
here by then we're done.

133
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,830
- We'll wake up Nico and
Thomas, we'll fight our way out.

134
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:00,600
- Well, how do we do that
without them noticing?

135
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,730
- I haven't figured
that part out yet.

136
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,370
- Even if...

137
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:07,400
- Temporal
displacement complete.

138
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,610
- He's fine!

139
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:10,440
That's all good, his
brain activity's normal,

140
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,310
his heart rate is fine,
everything's fine.

141
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,150
So?

142
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,850
- What about the
Butterfly Effect?

143
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:25,920
- Yeah, it could screw up
everything for them as well as us.

144
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,090
- So we wake him up
and we kill him now.

145
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:31,730
It won't affect the
future or the past.

146
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:33,400
- Maybe Philip will have
about epiphany there

147
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,330
and realize what they're
really trying to do.

148
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:39,740
- I wouldn't bet on that.

149
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:04,460
- So, we verified your identity.

150
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,460
Nicholai Stone.

151
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,170
We found your father, they're
trying to contact him...

152
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,400
- No, no, don't, don't
contact him, he's...

153
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,040
Listen, he suffers from
a rare mental disease.

154
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,210
He makes up stories,
gets confused.

155
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,380
- I empathize, my father has
cancer, but it is protocol.

156
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,110
- What type of cancer?

157
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:27,420
- Brain, don't
change the subject.

158
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,580
Who are you?

159
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,940
- Look, let me
level with you, Doc.

160
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,020
I haven't talked
to my dad in years.

161
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,530
You're right, my name
is Nicholai Stone

162
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,500
and the reason why
my records show

163
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,300
that I'm 10 is because
I was born in 2007.

164
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,900
- Look, I don't know what
you're talking about.

165
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,170
I'm in no mood for games.

166
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:46,670
- I'm not, either,
look, please wait.

167
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,740
I need your help, okay?

168
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,140
You seem like a good man.

169
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,340
I need time to explain.

170
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,880
I need you to keep
an open mind because,

171
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,180
look, I'm the least
craziest person that I know.

172
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:00,780
- I'm listening.

173
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:10,630
- I'm a scientist
from the year 2037

174
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:13,460
where life as I know it is
on the verge of extinction.

175
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,300
Women are completely infertile

176
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,770
and not a child has
been born in years

177
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:20,440
that has survived
longer than an hour.

178
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,370
- I think you need to
get some more rest.

179
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:23,510
Look, we'll do a CS scan,

180
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,770
check for any cranial
hemorrhaging...

181
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:26,110
- Look, I don't suffer
from delusions, okay?

182
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,310
Do you know the company Biocorp?

183
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:28,310
- Yes, they make most
of our equipment.

184
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,510
- What about them?
- Exactly!

185
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,610
They're the reason
why we are infertile!

186
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:31,850
- How do you know this?

187
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:33,080
- Because I told you,
I'm from the future!

188
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,150
Humanity is on the
verge of extinction.

189
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:38,490
There's no children, there
is no cure, there is no hope!

190
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:40,090
- This is why I'm gonna need
a psychiatric evaluation!

191
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,520
- I'm telling you the truth!

192
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,330
I know you might
think it sounds crazy

193
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:47,100
and you think I'm
delusional, but I'm not.

194
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,800
You are a doctor, your
job is to save people.

195
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,600
You have a chance right now
to save the entire world!

196
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,810
- Look, I need you to relax!

197
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:57,770
If not, I will call security.

198
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:58,840
Do you understand?

199
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,640
Do you?

200
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:03,910
- Yes.

201
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,010
- Good!

202
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:11,490
Look, I'm gonna get you
all the help that you need.

203
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,730
Yes, Frank, he needs
to be seen right away.

204
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:24,130
He might be perfect for
that study you're doing.

205
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:26,170
Oh yes, full
manifested delusions.

206
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,540
At 9 a.m.?

207
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,780
Thank you, I'll keep him
sedated for an hour or so.

208
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,780
Alright, Frank, thanks.

209
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,780
See you tomorrow.

210
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,390
- Why are you here?

211
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:45,690
Really?

212
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:47,990
- Okay.

213
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,660
I'm from the future.

214
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,730
20 years from now, to be exact.

215
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,200
Me and my friend
have time traveled

216
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,570
back here to fix something.

217
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,340
Something that threatens
the very existence

218
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,210
of the human race.

219
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:06,180
- The doctor said your
friend said that, too.

220
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,240
- Well, he's telling the truth.

221
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,240
And so am I.

222
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,720
- I know you believe
that, but it's not true.

223
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,290
- You have to open
your eyes, here.

224
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:19,620
Some things are true whether
you believe in them or not.

225
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,290
You have no idea what's coming.

226
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:24,260
In a couple of years the
government is gonna try

227
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:27,330
and make it law that
every single human being

228
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,130
gets a chip implanted
under their skin,

229
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:31,730
but it has the
unfortunate side effect

230
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:33,570
of making the whole
planet infertile.

231
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:38,710
Where I'm from not a single
child has been born in 20 years.

232
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:40,280
- I know you believe all this,

233
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:44,610
the time travel and the future...

234
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:45,610
- What if I'm right?

235
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,820
Think about it for
just a second, okay?

236
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,390
What damage can I possibly
do to a dying old man

237
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,320
that the world hasn't
already done, huh?

238
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:58,930
But if you release me, let
me go, let me out of here.

239
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,900
But I can't do it alone.

240
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,300
I need your help.

241
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:07,740
Please, release me.

242
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,510
- I can't.

243
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,890
- I should go check on him.

244
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:24,090
- Make it quick.

245
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,130
- Be ready.

246
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:45,240
- Everything will be okay.

247
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,040
Don't attack them, trust me.

248
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,250
- We have to.

249
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,980
- You will gain nothing.

250
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,750
You will lose everything.

251
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,720
- You're a kind man.

252
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,220
- I'm just an old fool trying

253
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:01,090
to save two beautiful
young ladies.

254
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:06,100
- What is all the
whispering about?

255
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,970
- He's not feeling well.

256
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:13,900
Do you mind if I make
everyone something to eat?

257
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,280
- Can I help her?

258
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,280
She's really weak.

259
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:26,980
- No.

260
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,430
- For some reason I believe you.

261
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:42,370
- Thank you.

262
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:43,800
- Then let's get right to it.

263
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,500
- What's that for?

264
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,940
- This is mine.

265
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,340
- And what are you
gonna do with it?

266
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,570
- If they come in
here I want them

267
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,240
to know that you
held me hostage.

268
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,440
- Okay, deal.

269
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:00,050
Thank you.

270
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,200
- Hey, Jen.

271
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,200
Who's your friend?

272
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:20,340
- Uh, this is actually an
old friend of Dr. Mangan's.

273
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,340
- Father or son?

274
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:23,810
- Uh, both, actually.

275
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,110
- Did you call it in ahead?

276
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,650
Yeah, here it is.

277
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:31,010
- Where is Dr. Mangan?

278
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,720
- I guess he's still
out on a consult.

279
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,280
- He's always really busy.

280
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,990
- Was he supposed
to meet you here?

281
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:37,990
- No.

282
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,920
- It doesn't matter.

283
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,390
- No, it doesn't matter.

284
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:46,130
It just proves that it's
like father, like son, huh?

285
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,760
- It seems that way.

286
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,760
I love your accent.

287
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,130
- Isn't it great?

288
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:52,400
- Oh, ladies are just
flattering me, I'm gonna blush.

289
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,440
It's really quite
ordinary where I'm from.

290
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,740
- Well, to us it's a
break in the every day.

291
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,410
You guys can go ahead
and go on through.

292
00:15:58,410 --> 00:15:59,710
- Thank you.

293
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,640
Would you give me a
moment alone with him?

294
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,640
- Sure.

295
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,180
- Thank you, nice to meet you.

296
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,220
- It was nice to meet you.

297
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,490
- Nico!

298
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:10,950
I've only got a minute.

299
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:12,420
- I never thought I'd be
happy to see your ugly face.

300
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,960
- What the hell happened,
how are we still here?

301
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,630
- I don't know, they could
wake us up at any minute.

302
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,230
- Well, did you send
the signal to David?

303
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,430
- I did, I sent him the signal

304
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:21,300
right before we put
ourselves under.

305
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,630
- Then there's a problem.
- I don't know.

306
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:24,070
- At their end!

307
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:26,670
- Their end, but I don't
know how long we've been out.

308
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:27,870
I'm just afraid they
could wake us up

309
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,340
at any minute, the
power could get cut...

310
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,910
- If the power gets
cut we're dead.

311
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,380
- No, we don't
know that for sure.

312
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,840
We don't.

313
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,540
- Okay, but what we do know
is that we gotta leave.

314
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,650
- I have a plan.

315
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:37,880
- What is it?

316
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,420
- The doctor, his
dad has cancer.

317
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,520
- Real cancer?

318
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,790
- Yeah, like real cancer.

319
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:46,220
This is 2017, they don't
a cure for three years.

320
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,160
- Okay, and?

321
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:49,990
- So, what?

322
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:50,830
We can save him!

323
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:51,760
That'll save us.

324
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,130
- Save the doctor's father, why?

325
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:56,330
Why would we, what about
the Butterfly Effect?

326
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:58,570
- I thought about that but we
need the doctor to believe us.

327
00:16:58,570 --> 00:16:59,740
We need him to believe us.

328
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,000
- Oh, I don't know, Nico.

329
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,310
If the cure for cancer isn't out

330
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,540
for another three years think of

331
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,210
all the damage we
could do by letting

332
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:06,680
the cat out of
the bag too early.

333
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,280
- Okay, what, saving millions
of people, is that so bad?

334
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,280
- This isn't a question
of right or wrong, Nico.

335
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,750
This is about causing
too much damage,

336
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,980
ripping our own future apart.

337
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,550
- What's so bad about that?

338
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,720
Think about all the mothers,
the fathers we would save.

339
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,420
All the children we would save.

340
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,190
The possibility of them living.

341
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:21,890
- I thought we couldn't rule
out the Butterfly Effect.

342
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,060
That's a rule you made up.

343
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,590
- I'm not ruling...
- You said it yourself!

344
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:25,790
I'm not ruling it out, okay?

345
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:27,930
I'm just saying we
can't be slaves to it.

346
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:29,270
We've been here
interacting with people.

347
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:31,000
You know how much damage
that has caused already?

348
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,930
Are you thinking?

349
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:33,200
- That is different, okay?

350
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,370
We weren't trying to
cure cancer before.

351
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:36,610
- If you're so worried about it

352
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:37,410
why don't we just
kill ourselves now?

353
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:38,410
Is that what you want?

354
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,610
- No, I want us to
be careful, Nico,

355
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:43,010
and remember that
we're not gods.

356
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,910
- I'm not saying we're gods.

357
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,320
I'm just saying we...

358
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,620
I'm saying we need to try.

359
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:50,450
- Come on.
- Okay.

360
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:51,620
- Now get your ugly face
over here and cut me out.

361
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,260
- Stop calling me ugly.

362
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,190
I'll take care of the father.

363
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:57,510
You find drugs to
put us to sleep.

364
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,700
- Attention, a violent patient

365
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,130
has escaped on
Wing C, code blue!

366
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,630
- Can I have security, please?

367
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:11,370
Attention all units.

368
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:13,710
Our suspect is at large
inside the hospital

369
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,480
and under delusions,
he's violent.

370
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,150
Use extreme caution.

371
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:27,090
- Nice to meet you, Frank.

372
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:32,090
It's your lucky day.

373
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,980
This means you won't be
able to have kids, Frank.

374
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,120
I'm hoping that's okay.

375
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,600
You'll be alright.

376
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,440
- Freeze!

377
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,700
- Suspect apprehended.

378
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,900
- Hands up!

379
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,980
- ICU Room 4, second floor.

380
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:18,610
- Hey, hey!

381
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:19,540
- Put it down!

382
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,910
- Alright, alright.

383
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,040
- Turn around.

384
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,680
Hands on your head!

385
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,580
On your knees.

386
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,580
You, go!

387
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:30,850
Hands on your head,
hands on your head.

388
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,860
- Hey, what are you doing?

389
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:44,170
- Heading to second floor.

390
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:47,500
- Fine, fine.

391
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,870
- So, Nicholai,
where did you go?

392
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,010
- To visit my friend.

393
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:53,680
- What, fully clothed?

394
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,610
- Well, the robe gave me chills.

395
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:57,910
- Unfortunately,
this escape attempt

396
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:01,420
solidifies my feeling, you're
not ready to be released yet.

397
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,590
Paranoia is a frequent symptom.

398
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:05,420
I have some medicine
to help you rest.

399
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,790
- Look, I don't
need medicine, okay?

400
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:07,790
I'm not crazy.

401
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,130
- Nicholai, you are
not from the future!

402
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:12,830
Time travel does not exist.

403
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,030
And until you start
to realize that

404
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,560
I can't trust you to
function within society.

405
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,130
- Look, I can prove it.

406
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,530
Just give me a chance.

407
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:19,370
- Hold him down.

408
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:20,340
- Wait, no, no, listen!

409
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,170
I can save your father.

410
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,370
Listen to me, I can
save your father!

411
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:25,240
Look, I have a cure,
you have to believe me!

412
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,410
Look at me, I'm not lying!

413
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:28,140
I have a cure, I have a cure!

414
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:30,680
I'm not lying!

415
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,180
I can save your father!

416
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,380
I can save your dad!

417
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,520
- Hold him down.

418
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,780
- Get, no!

419
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,950
Get, no, no, no, no!

420
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:43,030
Believe me, I can cure,
I can cure your father.

421
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:44,060
Believe me!

422
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:44,890
- There you go.

423
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:45,890
- Believe me.

424
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:49,970
No, no, Jenny.

425
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:52,030
Jenny!

426
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,030
- Jenny?

427
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,350
- Mm, smells good.

428
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:14,490
- Help yourself.

429
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,180
- Hello, Nicholai.

430
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,180
- Who is it?

431
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,920
- Don't you recognize me?

432
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:43,850
- No.

433
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,390
- My name is Philip Edier.

434
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:50,230
- Where's my wife, my sister?

435
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:51,790
- So you do know who I am?

436
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,160
- Are they alive?

437
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,240
- My men are looking
after them and you,

438
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,740
just for everybody's protection.

439
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:04,510
If anything happens to me and I

440
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:08,240
don't return
they'll be executed.

441
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,510
- What are you doing here?

442
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:12,950
- Oh, I am here to
help all humanity.

443
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:16,750
To set right what you've
attempted to undo.

444
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,120
- Thomas should have killed
you when he had the chance.

445
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,190
- Oh, is he here with you?

446
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:23,030
Nearby, maybe?

447
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:25,790
I'm just dying to
meet him again.

448
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,000
- He spared your life.

449
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,700
He could have killed you.

450
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,970
- You have no idea
what he did to me.

451
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,440
What he made me.

452
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,540
- Commander on site!

453
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:43,610
- I knew it.

454
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,080
- If it were any
other day I'd be

455
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,750
irritated by another
uninvited guest.

456
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:56,960
He can't by any
worse than the last.

457
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,250
- Report.

458
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,280
- Sir, this is how
they time travel.

459
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,620
- Thank you for that
penetrating analysis.

460
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,260
- The other two
are the only ones

461
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,990
that know how the
machine operates.

462
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:32,390
This is his team.

463
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:34,400
They're not telling us much.

464
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,930
They claim not to
know enough to effect

465
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:37,170
any changes on the device.

466
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:38,930
- Edier believe this?

467
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:40,440
- I'm unsure, sir.

468
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,670
He followed them into stasis

469
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,270
to find the answers for himself.

470
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:46,370
- What orders did he leave?

471
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,610
- If we were to receive
signal from the stasis chamber

472
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:52,180
we're to start executing
hostages one at a time.

473
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:03,930
- What you may not be aware
of is that time travel

474
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:07,300
not under state
control is illegal.

475
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,370
- You expect me to believe that

476
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:12,370
the government has
access to time travel?

477
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:14,070
- You expect me to believe that

478
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:16,640
your friends created
this out of thin air?

479
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,880
- You're bluffing.

480
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,550
- Perhaps, but thank you for
confirming one of my theories.

481
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:29,920
We have located the source
of temporal disturbance,

482
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:33,390
but it's a lot more complicated
than we first thought.

483
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:34,790
Tell me everything you know.

484
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:38,060
- I already told him everything.

485
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:41,030
- Yes, well, I can't very well
much talk to him now, can I?

486
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,640
Edier may have flair,
but he's reckless.

487
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,780
Luckily for him, I
don't have such faults.

488
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:03,120
- So, why are you really here?

489
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,120
- To follow you.

490
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,560
To ask questions
that need answering.

491
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,560
- Like what?

492
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:12,130
- What's the key to
staying here without

493
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:15,030
being dependent on a
stable body in 2037?

494
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:18,870
- I don't know.

495
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:23,770
But even if I did,
I wouldn't tell you.

496
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:24,770
- Indeed.

497
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:29,140
You see, Nicholai,
I want to stay here.

498
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:32,880
This is a much better reality
than the one we came from.

499
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,120
- We already lived
this reality once.

500
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,790
- As children, that's nothing.

501
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:42,190
What power do children have?

502
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,160
None.

503
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:48,130
And just think of all
the pain they cause.

504
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:53,740
- So, are you saying
the infertility

505
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:56,640
of our future is a good thing?

506
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,370
- Oh, who knows?

507
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:00,640
This insistence that
children will somehow

508
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,150
save us from our inhumanity
towards each other.

509
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:06,850
You see this, hmm?

510
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,090
Your friend Thomas
did that to me,

511
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,560
in this time, when
I was a child.

512
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,830
So how can he and
you claim to lament

513
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:20,530
the loss of children
when you do this to them?

514
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,170
When you create
monsters like me?

515
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:26,530
- You're a coward!

516
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,710
You're running away.

517
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:34,680
We can fix the future.

518
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:37,750
Help me.

519
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:42,580
Help me fix what Biocorp
is doing now, here,

520
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:45,120
before it happens.

521
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:49,960
- I wonder what would
happen, Nicholai,

522
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:53,060
if I was to kill you now?

523
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:59,030
Would you just wake up in 2037?

524
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,370
I guess there's only
one way to find out.

525
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:15,680
- How's it looking?

526
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,680
- Not good.

527
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:20,590
They're even military out there.

528
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:22,460
- Not the police?

529
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:25,990
- No, well, the guy is dressed
in black with big guns,

530
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:27,760
so I don't think
it really matters.

531
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,600
- I don't wanna be here anymore.

532
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,270
- Okay, wait, hold on.

533
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,110
I can't let you go just yet.

534
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:41,840
I need you for just a
little bit more, okay?

535
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:47,120
What are you doing?

536
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:52,420
Relax, okay?

537
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:56,190
- I don't wanna stay
here, I'm scared.

538
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:57,190
- Look at my face.

539
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:01,600
You're just scared,
I'm scared, too.

540
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,470
Do you think I'm gonna hurt you?

541
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:08,000
- No.

542
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,170
- Do you think I'm gonna let
anybody out there hurt you?

543
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:11,510
- No.

544
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:13,580
- Okay, that's because I'm not.

545
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:17,010
The only person in
danger of hurting

546
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:22,020
anybody is you right
now, and I need you.

547
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:25,850
Jen, I can't do this alone.

548
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,290
I need you.

549
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:34,960
- Hey.
- Hmm?

550
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,800
- You okay?

551
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,430
- Yeah.

552
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:38,900
I'm okay.

553
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:39,900
- That's my girl.

554
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,410
Now I need you to leave.

555
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:45,410
- There's a whole
SWAT team out there.

556
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:47,740
- They won't hurt you, okay?

557
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,080
They'll see you're unarmed.

558
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:53,080
You'd look like just a hostage.

559
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:53,920
Go.

560
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,920
- Okay.

561
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,460
- This was a real good idea.

562
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,170
- What in the name
of God is going on?

563
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:18,610
- Doctor, you and your staff

564
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:19,840
should not be here,
it's not safe.

565
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,940
- Safe, what are
you talking about?

566
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,180
- We have a hostage situation.

567
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,780
One of the patients has
taken a nurse hostage.

568
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:25,910
- Which patient?

569
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:27,080
- An English guy.

570
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,620
- Who'd he take hostage?

571
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:31,150
- He took Jen, he said he
knew you and your father.

572
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:31,990
- Is this true?

573
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:32,990
- Certainly not.

574
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:34,990
- Then she must be under duress.

575
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:36,660
He used her to get into the ICU.

576
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,660
- Why would he...

577
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:40,530
- What is it?

578
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:43,100
- What was he doing in the ICU?

579
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,400
What'd he do to my father?

580
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,240
- He's safe.
- That's not what I'm asking.

581
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,340
- I saw him inject
something into

582
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,800
the IV and I called security.

583
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,040
- And that's
when we stopped him,

584
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:51,970
but whatever it
was he was doing...

585
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:53,240
- Is he still in his room?

586
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,800
- Yes, he's stable,
we're running tests.

587
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:58,510
- Come with me, ma'am.

588
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:04,090
- You have one minute to tell
me everything I need to know.

589
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,420
- Go to hell.

590
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:12,490
- One minute before
I signal my men

591
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:16,830
to execute either your
wife or your sister.

592
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:18,100
You see, I like my men to make

593
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,040
their own decisions
from time to time.

594
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,040
- You already know everything.

595
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:26,110
Otherwise you wouldn't be here.

596
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:29,040
- I need to understand
all about this

597
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,410
so I don't have to rely
on you and your friend.

598
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:35,880
- If that were the truth,
once I tell you, I'm dead.

599
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,920
There would be no
reason to keep me alive.

600
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:42,090
- Well, there are worse
things than just killing you.

601
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,160
You understand?

602
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:53,470
- How you doing, Dad?

603
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:58,040
- Alright, I'll just send my
men the signal to execute...

604
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,580
- Okay, okay, okay,
no, wait, wait, just...

605
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:07,550
It's all about
temporal mechanics.

606
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,720
We were trying to invent
teleportation, not time travel.

607
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,120
- Teleportation?

608
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,690
- So, I don't know anything.

609
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:17,330
I wasn't trying to find
this, this found me.

610
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:18,490
And I'm learning as I go.

611
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:20,500
- Am I expected to believe that?

612
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:24,000
- You know what, believe what
you want, but it's the truth.

613
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,530
David's the only one
that's went back and forth

614
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:27,340
and you're the only one
who's talked to him.

615
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,540
- Well, pretty soon, there'll
be someone else going back

616
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:34,540
because I ordered my men
to wake you in 30 minutes.

617
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,840
- Why?

618
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:39,910
- Because when you
get back there'll be

619
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:41,950
a guy waiting for you.

620
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:44,320
He's real good at
getting information.

621
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,160
He'll have a lot of
questions for you.

622
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:51,260
- So you're sending me
back to get tortured?

623
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,490
- And to prove the process

624
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:54,960
to get back to 2037
actually works.

625
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,000
- It does work, David
already went back.

626
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,200
- No!

627
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,670
He was awake when I arrived.

628
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:01,100
You think I'm gonna
trust his word?

629
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,940
- So you came all the way here

630
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,610
without knowing
you can get back?

631
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:08,980
- It was a risk I
was willing to take.

632
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,110
Come on, start talking.

633
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,720
- I have to be in stasis first.

634
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,820
If I'm awake when this
happens then I die.

635
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,720
- So what do I do?

636
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,960
Come on, clock's ticking.

637
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,690
- Okay, well, I
have to be asleep.

638
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:25,530
And I need drugs to
make this happen.

639
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:28,060
This applies to you,
too, so don't send

640
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:30,930
a signal until you're
ready to be under.

641
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:31,930
Do you understand?

642
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:40,540
- You try anything,
people will die.

643
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:42,510
You understand?

644
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:44,950
- Yes.

645
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:53,360
- What happened?

646
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,360
- His pulse-ox is up to
97 and still climbing

647
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,960
so we took him off the O2.

648
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,390
- We need a CT scan
done right away.

649
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:00,060
- It's already ordered.

650
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,230
- CBC with tox screen?

651
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:02,330
- Just came back negative.

652
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:03,630
- Well, that's preliminary.

653
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,030
- What are you talking about?

654
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:07,270
- That man injected my father

655
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:09,040
with a substance,
poison perhaps.

656
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,410
I'm just trying to find
out what damage he's done.

657
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:13,680
My father has a
Stage 4 brain tumor.

658
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,610
- We ran the CBC and
the tox screen twice.

659
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:17,710
It came back all clear.

660
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:19,150
- Well, perhaps it was...

661
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:22,180
- No, I mean he came
back clear of everything.

662
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:25,150
- Everything?

663
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:27,120
- I don't know what
to tell you, we ran it twice.

664
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,190
- What are you trying
to tell me, is he cured?

665
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:31,830
- We won't know until
we run further tests.

666
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:34,200
But I can say I haven't seen
him looking so well in months.

667
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,660
- So are you trying
to tell me that some

668
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:38,270
other patient injected
your father with something

669
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:40,440
and now his cancer
might be gone?

670
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,440
- That is a very
real possibility.

671
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,710
- What the hell?

672
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:45,340
- But I've never seen
a case of heart rate,

673
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:48,210
blood pressure, blood oxygen
level and overall power,

674
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:51,210
return to someone with
little time to live.

675
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:52,410
- We gotta find this guy!

676
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:53,920
- Look, it happened,
you can't just...

677
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,050
- Doc, Doc, don't worry,
we're not gonna shoot him.

678
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:57,490
But, whatever happened,
whatever miracle,

679
00:33:57,490 --> 00:33:59,020
we really need to
talk to this guy.

680
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,020
Team!

681
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:07,460
- Good news!

682
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:10,130
I have been ordered to wake
Thomas with the adrenaline shot.

683
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:11,170
- No, he'll die!

684
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,540
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

685
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:16,040
My sources tell me I am to
wake him up in 10 minutes.

686
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,840
He will be prepared to return.

687
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,570
- And how the hell
do you know that?

688
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:22,710
- We know everything
we need to know.

689
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:24,910
What can you
possibly understand?

690
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:27,880
Rabble, that's all you are.

691
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,680
Which one is Thomas?

692
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,420
- I don't know.

693
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,650
- Don't try me.

694
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:33,650
- Okay.

695
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:39,490
- No!
- Stop, you're gonna kill him!

696
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,830
- I am going to put the
adrenaline shot in both of them.

697
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:47,840
One will win, the
other will lose.

698
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,740
Which one is Thomas?

699
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,810
- No, Jenny, don't!

700
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,710
- Open your mouth.
- No!

701
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:00,080
- Open it!
- Lauren!

702
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,850
- Tell me now.

703
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:05,950
I am going to kill
each of you one by one

704
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:08,120
over the next 10
minutes until you speak!

705
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:11,030
Or shall I wake them all now?

706
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:12,890
- Young man, please,
have mercy on

707
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:14,360
these innocent people,
they're harmless!

708
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,600
- Be quiet, old man!

709
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,080
- Please don't harm
them, let them go!

710
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:18,900
- Stop it.

711
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,200
Not so tough now, tell me!

712
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,670
- No!
- Three!

713
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,540
- Two!
- Wait!

714
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:25,970
I'll tell you.

715
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:34,520
This is Thomas.

716
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,280
- Are you sure, old man?

717
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:40,020
- As sure as the fact
that you'll be dead soon.

718
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,620
- Alright, have it your way.

719
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,790
Prep two injections!

720
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:45,190
- Wait, what, no, no!

721
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:47,760
- I don't care if
they're ready or not!

722
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,000
We're going to
execute them anyway

723
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,700
for murdering a
Biocorp employee.

724
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,130
They're already dead.

725
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:54,440
Might as well just finish
them off now, right?

726
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,600
- Okay, okay!

727
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,840
I'll tell you whatever
you wanna hear!

728
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,040
- Oh, that wasn't
so hard, was it?

729
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,710
Philip has a more exciting
way of executing you.

730
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:06,950
- No!

731
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:09,020
- Much more brutal
than a gunshot.

732
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:12,290
Besides, we really should
interrogate him first.

733
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:15,160
He may hold all the answers.

734
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,630
I think I'll just
watch the show.

735
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:25,830
- What is this?

736
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:28,240
Dummies?

737
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,240
- No, it's a
simulation facility.

738
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:32,640
- You're running out of time.

739
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,780
If you don't get into
stasis you'll be a dead man.

740
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:37,780
- I know.

741
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:40,010
- What are you looking for?

742
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:42,050
- Pills, tranquilizers,
anything to put us under.

743
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,490
- You got 'em, come on!

744
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:52,230
You're not thinking of
backing out on me, are you?

745
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:53,900
- Look, see?

746
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,400
Right here.

747
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,400
Okay?

748
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,670
Alright, um, first I have to...

749
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,580
- You son of a bitch!

750
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:25,160
You just signed the death
warrant of all you hold dear.

751
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,580
- Okay, alright!

752
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,580
- Game's over.

753
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,650
- Alright.

754
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:45,910
- Syringe, now!

755
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,950
- I got it.

756
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:52,290
- On the gurney.

757
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:57,090
Come on.

758
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,500
Do it!

759
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:06,970
- Okay.

760
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:22,980
- System shutting down.

761
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,190
- Not such a harmless
old man now, am I?

762
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:26,420
- Nicholai connection lost.

763
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:28,420
- No!

764
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:29,620
- Get the power on!

765
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,960
- Thomas connection lost.

766
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,790
- Please, don't, wait!

767
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:33,860
- Fix it now!

768
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:02,190
- Goodnight, sweetheart.

769
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,130
- Distress detected.

770
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:10,970
- Wake him up!

771
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:12,230
- But how?

772
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:13,000
I can't, the link
has been severed!

773
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
- Do it!

774
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:34,720
- There's nothing you can do!

775
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,860
- Do something!
- Like what?

776
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:36,790
- Or I will!

777
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:38,090
- Please, just wait!

778
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,510
- Room clear!

779
00:39:58,510 --> 00:39:59,510
- Secure the room.

780
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:07,220
Father!

781
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,420
- Nico!

782
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:10,530
- Father, what happened?

783
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:11,990
- No, don't!

784
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:14,200
- We weren't sure if you
were gonna send the signal.

785
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,560
Maybe I should have waited.

786
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:19,330
- You arrived just
when you were meant to.

787
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:20,600
- Don't!
- Get off!

788
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:24,440
- You okay, are you okay?

789
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,910
- This is all your fault!

790
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:27,910
No!

791
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:31,550
- Sir?

792
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:32,880
- Why aren't these men cuffed?

793
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,220
- They surrendered to us, sir.

794
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,380
They said they're
patients and friends

795
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,150
with the man in ICU 4.

796
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,390
- How about this guy?

797
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:40,320
- No, no, no, no,
these men are with me.

798
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,920
I've been trying
to tell you this.

799
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,060
They're patients of
mine and I can vouch

800
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:46,290
that they had nothing
to do with this.

801
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:48,860
Everything they say is
pretty much the truth.

802
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:51,030
- So, that's your
story and that's

803
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:52,570
what's going in my report?

804
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:54,440
- Of course, your report
should reflect the truth.

805
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,600
Let's get our patients
back into their rooms.

806
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,600
Right this way.

807
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,080
- Is this who you spoke of?

808
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,540
- Protect them, my son.

809
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:06,080
This is our duty.

810
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,080
- Who are you?

811
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:10,550
- We're the resistance and
we're here to help you.

812
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,220
- Who are you?

813
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:21,630
- Hello, son.

814
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,930
- How you doing, Dad?

815
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:25,430
- I never thought
that hospital food

816
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:27,800
could make me feel as
good as I feel right now.

817
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,510
- Dad, these are the gentlemen
who helped save your life.

818
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:34,380
- How can I ever thank you?

819
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:35,580
- It's all good.

820
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,880
- You see, the fact
that he couldn't

821
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,280
save me was killing him.

822
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,280
- He's a good man.

823
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:44,950
- Don't try to eat too
much at once, okay?

824
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:46,620
- You just stop fussing
over me and find me

825
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:49,020
a room where I can
watch a baseball game.

826
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,130
- You got it, pops.

827
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:53,130
You got it.

828
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:01,000
As you can see, I owe you far
more than I can ever repay.

829
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,540
- Well, perhaps we can pull
in a big favor one day.

830
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:06,540
- I doubt that's
possible, but I will try.

831
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:07,780
- I'm gonna get the adrenaline.

832
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:09,010
- No, wait, what
if you kill them?

833
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:09,640
- We have to bring them back!

834
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,580
- No!

835
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:12,480
- We have to, they're gonna die!

836
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,920
- They will only die here if you

837
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:17,550
wake them up when
they're not ready.

838
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:18,490
- What?

839
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:20,220
- You'll kill them for good.

840
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,220
Forever.

841
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,460
- Well, we can't
just do nothing.

842
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:24,630
- That's exactly
what you must do.

843
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:28,460
Exactly what was asked of me.

844
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:34,670
They're alive, but their
connection's been severed.

845
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:37,040
- So you knew them all along?

846
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,440
- So you didn't show up
at my door accidentally.

847
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:43,380
- I owed Nicholai
and Thomas a favor.

848
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:46,050
- What favor?

849
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:47,950
- Doesn't matter now.

850
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:49,150
My debt's been repaid.

851
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:54,890
- So, you knew them in the past?

852
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:55,890
- I did.

853
00:42:57,290 --> 00:43:02,200
They're alive, but to you
they're trapped in 2017.

854
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:09,070
Nicholai entrusted me
with something to do.

855
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:12,410
Travis will take you to it.

856
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,010
It's in my room.

857
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:21,650
Jenny, Nicholai
loved you very much.

858
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:24,990
He wanted me to tell you.

859
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:27,550
- Thank you.

860
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:31,660
- Thomas told me
to tell you to look

861
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:33,960
under his bedside table.

862
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,200
Now, I've done all they asked.

863
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:45,010
Give me some time
with my own son.

864
00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:47,340
- Of course.

865
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:48,340
Let's go.

866
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:53,880
- My son, I love you.

867
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:58,290
- I don't know what to do.

868
00:43:58,290 --> 00:44:00,520
- You protect them.

869
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:04,130
Your grandfather
promised them we would.

870
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:10,300
- Tell Mom I love her.

871
00:44:12,570 --> 00:44:13,570
- Yes.

872
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:22,480
- Now what we're
gonna ask you to do is

873
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,010
not only to save our lives,

874
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:26,150
but the lives of
billions of people.

875
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:30,220
- Maybe the whole future
of the human race.

876
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:32,690
- Again gentlemen,
I'm only one man.

877
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:34,020
- And we're just two.

878
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:39,890
- Okay, what do I need to do?
