1
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,960
Previously, on Dystopia.

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,500
- Track the microchip.

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,500
Find Nico and come home.

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,500
- My son.

5
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:19,400
I love you.

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,840
- See how even Travis

7
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,110
gets nervous at the
thought of death.

8
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:25,510
- She died trying
to save your life.

9
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:28,150
She never gave up, so stubborn.

10
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:30,180
- The names on this list.

11
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,680
All the information is enough
to save the whole world,

12
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,220
all we have to do execute it.

13
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:37,690
- I'm not killing
2,000 people, Thomas.

14
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:39,260
- Then I'll do it alone.

15
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:42,960
- I will use it to go back and
change things for the better.

16
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,000
- The greatest
evil is not done now,

17
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:55,210
but it is conceived and
ordered, moved, seconded,

18
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:59,480
carried, and communicated
in clear, carpeted, warmed

19
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,980
and well-lighted offices by
quiet men with white collars

20
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:06,750
and cut fingernails and
smooth-shaven cheeks,

21
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,420
who do not need to
raise their voice.

22
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,190
They are the focus of
evil in the modern world.

23
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,610
- Today, Nobel Peace Prize
winning Biocorp made history

24
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,010
by administering
the cure for cancer,

25
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:10,380
available to the enter
world's population

26
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,320
in exchange for their
voluntary enrollment,

27
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,720
compulsory enrollment
in the ID chip program,

28
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,620
which allows for increased
population security.

29
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,690
Biocorp CEO stated,
in time, we understand

30
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:23,660
that the only thing worth
fighting for is family,

31
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,200
and today is a day
when we must decide

32
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,500
to fight for what's right
or roll over and die.

33
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:32,440
That's all for tonight.

34
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,140
- We're all clear.

35
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,140
- Thank you.

36
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,780
Come here, babe.

37
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,120
- Was it a good news day?

38
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,490
- I don't know baby, we're
gonna have to wait and find out.

39
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,460
- What's going to happen now?

40
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:54,590
- I don't know, but things
are going to change.

41
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,390
- Mrs. Adams.

42
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,590
- Yes.

43
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,660
- I'm David Johnson
from Biocorp.

44
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,900
Both of you come with me.

45
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,130
Now!

46
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:07,340
- Okay, come on.

47
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,410
- Yeah, babe, you see,
Thomas has the list

48
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,650
so we can't warn
everyone ahead of time.

49
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,850
- He's not gonna go
through the entire list.

50
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,650
Plus, the police would
catch him here in this time.

51
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:24,520
- What's that?

52
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,920
- Why is this going off?

53
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,930
- Is that your tracker?

54
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,530
- Yeah, David
programmed it for me.

55
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:34,360
- Oh, well we can use
this to find Thomas.

56
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,870
- No, someone else is here.

57
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,300
- Babe, but no, that's
Thomas right there.

58
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,870
- No, there's a fourth signal.

59
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,300
Maybe it's David.

60
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,670
- No, you and I know
that's unlikely.

61
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,810
- Well if it's not
David, it's not friendly.

62
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,950
And whoever it is,
they are moving fast.

63
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,080
- We need to
get outta here then.

64
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,020
- Wherever we go
they're gonna track us.

65
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,850
- Yeah, well let me think, okay?

66
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:57,290
All right so, Thomas said
that everyone on that list,

67
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,120
that they're from
all over the globe.

68
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,330
So, uh...

69
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,790
- So you think he's
gonna fly everywhere?

70
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:03,830
- No, it's too slow.

71
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,000
I know.

72
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,260
- What?

73
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,300
- If you don't have a
way to go to everyone.

74
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,240
- You bring everyone to you.

75
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,040
- Exactly, he's trying to attack
everyone at the same time.

76
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,140
- I have an idea.

77
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,410
- What?

78
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,780
- David, he put an
AI on my tracker.

79
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,310
- Ah, good boy, David.

80
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,520
- We can have the AI, it'll
link over to the computer system

81
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,750
and we can have
internet in this time.

82
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,820
Okay, moment of truth.

83
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,720
Computer, do you
have internet access?

84
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,120
- Yes of course, what would you

85
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,660
- like to see?
- All right.

86
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:39,230
Adam, pull the database for
any upcoming Biocorp events.

87
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,460
- I have accessed
the public calendar

88
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,330
for Biocorp, there's a
staff gala this Friday,

89
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:44,600
would you like the details?

90
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,600
- Yes.

91
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,170
Bingo, there it is,
everybody on the list.

92
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:51,440
- Wow, we gotta move.

93
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:58,980
- You know it's a good thing
I went back and you stayed.

94
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,620
I never could've
built that thing.

95
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,950
You're very versatile,
you know that?

96
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,720
You having doubts?

97
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,760
Hey, I get it.

98
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,200
I mean, of course you are, you're
not some kinda psychopath.

99
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,100
If you weren't having doubts,
then I'd be worried about ya.

100
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:19,940
This is a serious
move, my friend.

101
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:23,970
I mean, not like what you've
already been doing isn't,

102
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:28,450
but this, this is the next step.

103
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,050
This is where you've
been heading all along,

104
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:35,250
and it's been a dark
road the whole way.

105
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,290
Have you thought
about how many people

106
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:39,660
are gonna be there tonight?

107
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,160
I mean, really thought about it?

108
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:47,030
People with families,
with children.

109
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,230
2000 people with
hopes and dreams

110
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,700
and you're gonna turn
'em al into corpses

111
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,740
in the span of a second.

112
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,780
You know what 2000
people is, Thomas?

113
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,710
- Shut up.

114
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:02,710
- Do you?

115
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:07,920
It's 0.0022%

116
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:13,260
of how many are gonna get
killed in the riots of 2021.

117
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,260
It's 0.000029%

118
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,430
of the population of this world,

119
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:26,170
all of whose futures are
being determined here,

120
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,740
now, by you.

121
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:34,180
So you push that button
and don't even pretend

122
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,710
you've gotta think about it.

123
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,090
I mean hey, let's
not kid ourselves,

124
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:46,020
what you're
doin' is, a horrible thing.

125
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,760
You're already a
murderer buddy, but this,

126
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,030
this makes you a butcher.

127
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:57,870
What you do tonight
will haunt your dreams

128
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,770
for the rest of your life.

129
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:01,170
- Stop.

130
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,410
- So really at this point,

131
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,310
there's only one thing
you gotta ask yourself.

132
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,710
How much is your
sleep really worth?

133
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,820
One horrifying act

134
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,460
for the future of all mankind,

135
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,760
and for her.

136
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,670
- I guess if he's
talking from your head,

137
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:30,900
that makes me your heart.

138
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,470
You can't escape your fate.

139
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,940
Maybe it's our time to bow out.

140
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:45,210
Everything and
everyone has its time.

141
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,490
The only tragedy
is, we missed ours.

142
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,260
I'm going to see
you again, my love.

143
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,430
And when I do,

144
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,540
I wanna recognize your face.

145
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:15,680
Don't save me and lose yourself.

146
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:01,160
- Yeah, yeah I'm on my way
from work right now, actually.

147
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:03,890
- Yeah, I know...
- Excuse me, officer.

148
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,360
- Oh hey, yeah
man, what's goin' on?

149
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,130
- Could you tell me
where Calley Avenue is?

150
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,360
- Calley Avenue?
- Yeah.

151
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,500
- Yeah, actually
if you head over.

152
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:22,380
- I love these old antiques.

153
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:25,080
- I need you to hear me out.

154
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,020
- What?

155
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:26,820
- We need to stop Thomas.

156
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,050
- I-I-I know that, baby.

157
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,920
- No, no, no, we need
to do whatever it takes.

158
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,120
- What do you
mean, whatever it takes?

159
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,690
- We can't let him
kill all those people.

160
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,520
- I know, but I'm not
gonna kill Thomas!

161
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,330
Okay, I'm not playing this
kill or be killed game.

162
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:39,460
- So what, you're gonna try to
talk him down off the ledge?

163
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,730
I mean, have you seen him?

164
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,200
- Yeah, I saw him,
baby, just, just,

165
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,400
you know what, just stop.

166
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,870
Let me just talk
to him first, okay?

167
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:48,000
- Talk to him, Nico you are not
the one he wants to talk to.

168
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,870
- All right, you're right.

169
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:51,870
All right.

170
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,920
- Last chance to
change your mind.

171
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,760
- I don't wanna change my mind.

172
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,230
- Bye.

173
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,560
- Well, I guess you're
really gonna do this then.

174
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,200
- Yeah, it looks that way.

175
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,270
- Is he goin' to work?

176
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,400
- Yeah, workin'
hard for his family.

177
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,870
- Reminds me of someone I know.

178
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,330
- Still never fixed it.

179
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:23,770
Man.

180
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,040
Sorry, sis.

181
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:39,420
- Who the hell are you?
- Look, look, look...

182
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,720
- Where're you taking my baby?
- No, listen, look,

183
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,290
mom, mom, mom, listen.

184
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,890
- Help, somebody help me!
- No, look, mom, mom, mom,

185
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,720
look, okay, look, I'm your son.

186
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,120
I know it's hard to
believe, it's me, Nico.

187
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,460
Look, I broke my arm
in a baseball game

188
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,990
with Jimmy Fink, okay?

189
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:53,230
I used to ice cream, in a
special bowl, with bananas.

190
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:55,000
Do you remember, when
I was four, okay.

191
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,500
- We don't have much time.

192
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,100
- Okay, listen, I'm
gonna let you go, mom,

193
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,440
but you cannot scream,
do you understand?

194
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,540
Do you promise?

195
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,540
Okay.

196
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,410
- Who are you people?

197
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:08,610
You look so much like...

198
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:10,580
- I know, I know, I
need you to focus, okay?

199
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,850
Okay look, I'm your
son, I'm all grown up.

200
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:16,890
This, this is my wife,
Jenny, from the future.

201
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:17,850
- Hi.

202
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:19,320
- We're here to save Lauren.

203
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,720
- What?

204
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,230
- Something horrible happened
to her in the future.

205
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:23,760
Okay, we have a
chance to save her,

206
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,260
if you let her come with me.

207
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,660
- It's not possible!

208
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:29,030
- Yes, listen, you
have to believe me.

209
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:31,570
Listen, she deserves to
live a good, full life.

210
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,670
- What, what happened to her?

211
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,270
- If you help us,
she'll still grow up

212
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,940
to be a beautiful woman,
marry the man of her dreams,

213
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,440
have kids, have a family.

214
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,610
But if you don't help us
mama, she's gonna die.

215
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:45,710
- I don't understand,
you are at school,

216
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:48,480
and now you are so old.

217
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,750
- It's been a long time.

218
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:53,360
- My son, my son,
even if I believe you,

219
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,560
how can I let you
take my little girl?

220
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,530
- Don't hurt my baby.
- Believe me,

221
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:57,730
we're here to save Lauren.

222
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:59,400
We're here to save Lauren, okay?

223
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,800
- Nico, we have to go.

224
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,400
- Okay, listen mom, Lauren's
gonna be safe, okay.

225
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,300
You need to cherish your
life with your husband,

226
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,300
and your son.

227
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,570
- What did you do to her?

228
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:10,770
Did you drug her?

229
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:12,610
- Listen mom, I gave
her something to sleep.

230
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:13,940
Okay, I just gave her
something to sleep.

231
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,740
- I can't let her go, no!

232
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:20,550
- Listen to me, she is my
best friend in our time.

233
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,050
She looks just like you,
your eyes and everything.

234
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,090
Nico.

235
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:28,320
- Okay, okay, look, okay,
promise me you can't tell dad.

236
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,560
He will not understand
if you tell him.

237
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,300
- This is too much,
this is not happening.

238
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,830
This is a lot of information.

239
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:36,530
I cannot even process
all what's happening now.

240
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:39,270
- Don't you feel it,
that he's your son?

241
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:44,110
- I know this is real, and I
can feel that you're my son,

242
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:47,080
but, yes, take care of her.

243
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,080
- I will.

244
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,050
- Nico, we have to go.

245
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:52,480
- I know babe, just
give me a minute.

246
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,320
- Please hurry.

247
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,780
- I will, I promise.

248
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:55,780
Take her to the car.

249
00:13:58,850 --> 00:13:59,850
- Take care of her.

250
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,130
You grew up to be
a fine-looking man,

251
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:13,000
and your wife,
she's so beautiful.

252
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,200
- Yes, she is beautiful.

253
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,570
- What happened, what's
wrong, what's wrong?

254
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:20,140
- Mom, I have to
tell you something.

255
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,650
Where I'm from, you're not
in the future with me...

256
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:25,920
- But I'm here now, I'm with
you, I'll always be with you.

257
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,650
I'm your mother.

258
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:30,150
- Listen, you really
were the best mother

259
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:32,760
in the entire world,
the best mother.

260
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,520
- You always say that to me.

261
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,860
- Come on, Nico.

262
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:44,070
Guess you really
always were beautiful.

263
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:49,040
- Mom, you can come with me.

264
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,870
You can take care
of Lauren with me.

265
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:53,980
- But, who will be your
mother, here and now?

266
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,480
Who's gonna take care of you?

267
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,550
Who's gonna be there when
your father cannot be there?

268
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:00,050
I can't leave him,
I have to stay here

269
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:01,680
with you and your father.

270
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,420
- I heard that there are women

271
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,390
outside the city that
are still fertile.

272
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,630
They have a natural
immunity to the virus

273
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:14,460
that those inside
the city don't.

274
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:27,910
- I have to go now.

275
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,920
No, mom, no!

276
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,090
No mom!

277
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:42,930
- Are you hit?

278
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:43,860
- No, my mom's hit.

279
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,130
- Nico, you have to leave her.

280
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:46,230
Stand up, you have
to run, leave her.

281
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,100
- No, no.
- Nico.

282
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,610
- I don't normally do house
calls, but who's first?

283
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:59,240
- She is, doc.

284
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,480
How close?

285
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,710
- We have time.

286
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,650
- Doc, can you do
this fast, or what?

287
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:03,910
- I have no choice, let me see.

288
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:07,780
All right, this will
numb the area, okay?

289
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:10,290
- Okay, that sounds
like a good idea.

290
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:11,520
- It'll be fine.

291
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,990
- Okay.

292
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,590
- Don't look, don't
look babe, it's good.

293
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:17,430
- Jesus.

294
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:20,730
- No, it's okay babe, it's okay.

295
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,800
- Okay, all right.

296
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,470
- It's okay babe, no don't
look, don't look, don't.

297
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:26,740
You're doin' fine,

298
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,940
you're doin' just fine.

299
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,810
- Well come on, come
on, let's go, let's go.

300
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:33,610
- I've seen it, looks ordinary.

301
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:35,040
- We don't have time
for sightseeing, Doc.

302
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,210
- Yes, of course.

303
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,450
All right.

304
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:40,280
- It worked, but
he's getting closer.

305
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,880
- Stitch her quick
then, stich her quick.

306
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,850
- There's a bandage, okay.

307
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,320
Your turn.

308
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,820
- No, forget about it
doc, just forget about it.

309
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,060
- If you flinch, I could sever
a blood vessel or a tendon.

310
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,430
- Look, I'm not gonna
flinch, just do it.

311
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:50,930
- Okay, hold him still.

312
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:51,930
- Come on, let's go!

313
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,700
- Do not move.

314
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,400
You can't be still.

315
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,240
Almost there.

316
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,370
- And he's almost here.

317
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:04,240
- Where's the chip?
- I've got the chip,

318
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,080
it's in really deep.

319
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,710
- Go baby, go, go check
on Lauren in the car.

320
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:10,880
- What?
- Go to the car.

321
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,280
Go to the car and
check on Lauren, do it!

322
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,550
Do it, come on, it's
there and let's go.

323
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:15,480
- Almost there okay,
I'm almost there.

324
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,050
- Uh, come on Doc, come on Doc!

325
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:18,450
- Got it, I've got it.

326
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,960
Hey, I need to patch you up.

327
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,290
- Not enough time.

328
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,090
- You okay?

329
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:58,430
- What, oh yeah.
- You're just having a dream.

330
00:17:58,430 --> 00:17:59,430
- Yeah.

331
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,130
- A dream.

332
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:02,060
- What?
- A dream.

333
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,670
- Oh, I had a nightmare.

334
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,470
- What, about the kid?

335
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:08,400
- Sort of.

336
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,840
- What do you mean, sort of?

337
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,410
- Well it started off that way

338
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:13,980
and then Thomas showed
up, and the kid, he...

339
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,150
- And it ended the
way it always does.

340
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,150
- Yeah.

341
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,120
Babe, he wants her.

342
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:20,950
- No, he doesn't, that's...

343
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,420
- Yes he does,

344
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,650
- he wants to hurt her.
- He doesn't, he doesn't.

345
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:24,850
- We gotta get her
somewhere safe.

346
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:26,090
- She is safe, it
was just a nightmare.

347
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:27,020
- No, we gotta protect her.

348
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,060
- We will.

349
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,530
- From Thomas.

350
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:31,960
- Thomas would never do anything
to hurt her, you know that.

351
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,960
- I'm afraid I don't, babe.

352
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,960
- Dammit.

353
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,400
Still got you.

354
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:16,210
(tense, suspenseful music

355
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:50,810
- Ow.

356
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,780
- You're still alive.

357
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:59,210
- Yeah, still ticking.

358
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:00,210
- Hi.

359
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:03,620
- And who is this little
person at my door?

360
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,090
What's your name, young lady?

361
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:08,890
- My name's Lauren, do you
have any apple juice, please?

362
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:12,260
- Yeah, come on in, we'll
what we can do for you.

363
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,230
- Thank you.

364
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:14,460
- Come on, I'll take you.

365
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,070
- Ow.

366
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,070
- Still sore?

367
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,840
- Yeah, it's all right.

368
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,400
- I should sew it up.

369
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,400
- Please.

370
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:43,130
- Well you managed not
to wreck your arm completely.

371
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,760
- Not that he didn't try.

372
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,330
- So who is your little friend?

373
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:50,570
- That's my sister.

374
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,970
- If you don't mind me
asking, where are you?

375
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:59,940
- My younger self,
I'm at home, with my father.

376
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:02,040
- What about your mother?

377
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,950
Things are getting more
and more complicated.

378
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,450
- You have no idea.

379
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:11,950
- What, what's the big secret?

380
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:16,490
- In the future, where I
come from, you saved my life.

381
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,660
His too.

382
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,700
- It's true.

383
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,130
- How'd I do that?

384
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:25,470
- We reconnect, but I
shouldn't tell you too much

385
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:27,240
about your own life.

386
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,510
- Well I'm glad to know
that I'm still around then.

387
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:32,170
- Anyway, I just
wanted to thank you.

388
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:35,610
You are one of the bravest
people that I ever meet.

389
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,180
- Well, it's the least
I can do for the man

390
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,980
that saved my father's life.

391
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:43,990
- Dad?

392
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:45,250
- Oh, come here, son.

393
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,790
We have some guests.

394
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:49,290
- You didn't tell
me you had a son.

395
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:51,760
- I mean, why else do I
have all those juice boxes?

396
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,660
This is Travis, Travis,
these are my friends.

397
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:57,170
- Hell Travis, I'm
Nicholai, you can call me Nico.

398
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:00,070
- Now go on and
play with Lauren, okay?

399
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,300
- Huh?

400
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,170
- She's staying here for
a bit, it's all right.

401
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:14,320
His mother passed away two
years ago in an accident.

402
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,950
He's all that I
have left of her.

403
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:20,220
Thanks to you, we have
more time, years perhaps.

404
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:24,560
And for that, I
am ever grateful.

405
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,460
- So he's doing well?

406
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:30,170
- He's healthy, and he has
a positive outlook on life.

407
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:32,640
And knowin' that
I have 30 years,

408
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,840
he'll probably still outlive me.

409
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,710
And poor Travis
is stuck with me.

410
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,780
- That's a good thing, Doc.

411
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,780
Spending time with
family's important.

412
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:45,910
- Yes it is, and Travis
is a full-time job.

413
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,680
Something wrong?

414
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,350
- No.

415
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,360
- You sure, babe?

416
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,190
- Um-hm, yeah, I'm fine.

417
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:01,430
- Thomas has one of these
trackers too, as I recall.

418
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:02,360
So where is he?

419
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,430
- Oh, he's, he's changed.

420
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,710
- We think that he's planning
something, something terrible.

421
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:11,510
- Something like what?

422
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,110
- I can't tell you right now.

423
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,850
- Well, whatever it is,
let me know if I can help.

424
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:19,750
- Actually, I do
need your help, Doc.

425
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,750
- No.

426
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,990
- I need you to
watch her for me.

427
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:27,190
- Oh course.

428
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:33,200
- You see something,
something bad happens to her

429
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,030
in the future, and we're
trying to prevent that.

430
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:40,040
- Is that what changes Thomas?

431
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:40,970
- Hm?

432
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:42,470
- He spoke of Lauren last time.

433
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:46,410
- Yeah I guess.

434
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,680
- Look, I'll watch over her
like she's one of my own.

435
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,410
- Are you sure, we don't
wanna inconvenience you.

436
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:54,080
- We could...
- Baby, it's just for now.

437
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,050
- I don't wanna pile
anything extra on him,

438
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:56,590
we should just take her and...

439
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,690
- Look, I understand,
if you don't stop Thomas

440
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:01,390
from whatever it is, it'll
only make matters worse.

441
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,390
- That's just it,
we gotta get goin'.

442
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,970
Is that Thomas?

443
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:17,810
- It's hard to say,
there's two signals

444
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:19,170
and they're getting closer to
each other, we have to go now.

445
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:20,910
- Wait, wait, wait, Nico.

446
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,280
Good luck, okay, and
don't worry about her,

447
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,550
she's in good hands.

448
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,550
- Thanks, Doc.

449
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,350
Let's go, babe.

450
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:31,720
Hey, what was that about?

451
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,890
- What?

452
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:34,390
- You look like you saw a ghost.

453
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:36,020
- He gave his life for you,

454
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,360
I wasn't sure if I
should say anything.

455
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,460
- I know but...

456
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:43,170
- His son, Travis, he doesn't
turn out quite so well.

457
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:45,830
It's nothing, okay just...

458
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:46,900
- Hey, hey, you sure?

459
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,670
- Yeah, I was just
caught off guard.

460
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,370
Let's go.

461
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:53,380
- All right.

462
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:02,380
Wish I could go back and
destroy that machine.

463
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,490
- Babe, none of this is your
fault, you know that, right?

464
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:05,690
- If I wouldn't have
built the machine,

465
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:06,960
none of this would've happened.

466
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,220
- You give people
a fighting chance

467
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,630
at something that
they never had before.

468
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:11,690
- There're gonna keep
sending people back after us,

469
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:12,930
don't you get it?

470
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:14,600
- What're you saying?

471
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,930
- What I'm saying is,
we need to get home now,

472
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:16,930
more than ever.

473
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,800
I've gotta rebuild the machine.

474
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,340
- Then you'll rebuild it.

475
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:26,140
- I, I can't
do it without Thomas.

476
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,910
- Then we'll convince Thomas,

477
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:31,980
after we stop him
from killing everyone.

478
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,520
- Right.

479
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,120
- Wait, wait, stop.

480
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,500
- Babe we can't, we
can't, no, babe, we don't...

481
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:46,560
- Okay, okay, everything's
gonna be okay.

482
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,230
- It hurts.
- Nico, call an ambulance.

483
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:49,460
- My baby!

484
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,330
- What's your name,
what's your name?

485
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:51,830
- Carmen.

486
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,070
- Carmen, okay, I need you
to breathe, Carmen okay,

487
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,700
stay with me, I'm
not gonna leave you.

488
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,940
- All right.

489
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,470
- You're not gonna be
alone, just relax, okay.

490
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:59,070
- Okay, the ambulance is coming.

491
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,980
Babe, you know we can't stay.

492
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,680
- Nico, I'm not
leaving her, I can't,

493
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,910
and you know why.

494
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:06,150
- No, no, no, we have to go.

495
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:07,950
- No, you need to go,
just go without me.

496
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:12,090
Find Thomas, I'll be right
behind you, I promise.

497
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,960
I'm meant to be here.

498
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,790
- Okay, okay.

499
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:16,790
- I love you.

500
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:21,630
Okay, okay, Carmen, I
need you to breathe, okay.

501
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:22,830
What's your baby's name?

502
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:25,470
- Kadence.
- Kadence, baby Kadence right?

503
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:26,940
You know how lucky you are?

504
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:30,340
- Do you, do you
have any children of your own?

505
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,940
- Not yet, one day.

506
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,440
- One day.

507
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,950
- One day.

508
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:46,890
- Hey how you doin'?

509
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:47,820
- Good, and you?

510
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:48,760
- Good, good, good, did you get

511
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,030
into the Biocorp Ball tonight?

512
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:50,960
- Yeah, of course.

513
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,060
- You got an invite?

514
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,260
- Yeah, right here.

515
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:55,700
- Okay so I need that,
and your clothes.

516
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,170
- Good one, Arnie.

517
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:02,600
- Get out of the car,
give me the invite, man.

518
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,600
Come on.

519
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,910
Take your jacket off.

520
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:09,280
You work for Biocorp?

521
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,210
- Yeah.

522
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:12,550
- Well you really shouldn't.

523
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:16,050
- Come on, come on, come on.

524
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:18,220
- We didn't find any downside.

525
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,720
From all the research
that we've done, sir,

526
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,930
we have had absolutely
nothing goin' on,

527
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:25,630
but what I'm talking about
is we need to make extra sure

528
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:26,900
before we go in front of the FDA

529
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,060
or any of the other
approval boards...

530
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,700
- That's exactly...
- Senator, I'm so sorry.

531
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,970
- Oh, that's all right.

532
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:32,800
- But I just wanted
to shake your hand.

533
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,970
- Hello.

534
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:35,470
- Hello.

535
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:38,070
And Robert, I didn't expect
to see you again so soon.

536
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:40,840
What a bonus that you're here.

537
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,680
- Yeah, it's good
to see you too.

538
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,180
- Enjoy the party.

539
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:16,580
- There's a possible intruder
in the maintenance area.

540
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:58,590
Sir, this area's off limits.

541
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:00,120
- I'm sorry?

542
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,520
- I said sir, this
area's off limits.

543
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,130
- Okay, I'm
sorry, I'm not from here.

544
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:07,930
I was just looking for a
place for a cheeky cigarette.

545
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:08,860
- Sir, you're gonna
have to come with me.

546
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,170
- Yes, of course, please.

547
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:22,580
- Sir, this area's off limits.

548
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:25,950
- Yes, I'm sorry gentlemen, I
was looking for the bathroom.

549
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:28,120
- It's just off the main
entrance, it's this way.

550
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,190
- Ah, it is, well I will
just go straight there.

551
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:32,120
- We'll escort you.

552
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,260
- Please, lead the way.

553
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,860
- Can I see your
invitation, please?

554
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,130
- Yes of course, I've
got it right here.

555
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:56,080
- May I help you, sir?

556
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,180
- Hi, I'm here for
the Biocorp event.

557
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,650
- Sir, the main entrance
is around to the front.

558
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:03,890
- Oh I'm with a special
group within the company

559
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:06,520
that's here to put on a
special surprise tonight.

560
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,790
- Well do you have a
regular invitation, sir?

561
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:11,130
- No.

562
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:13,360
- Then I'm afraid I
can't let you in at all.

563
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,130
- Well I'm afraid
that I outrank you

564
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:18,470
in every conceivable
way and I am coming in.

565
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:20,870
- Sir, please leave the
premises immediately.

566
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:23,370
- Or what?

567
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:25,090
- Or I'll have you
arrested for trespassing.

568
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:28,580
- Then I guess you
better arrest me.

569
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:32,080
- Okay, give me one
big push, all right?

570
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,450
Come on try it,

571
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:34,780
you're okay, you're okay.

572
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:35,820
- I can't do it!
- Yes you can, yes you can.

573
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,350
I can't do it!

574
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,320
- You're doin' good, you're
doin' good, okay, look at me.

575
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,420
You're doin' a great job.

576
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,360
- I can't!
- One big push, okay.

577
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,090
- No!
- Okay, huh?

578
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,260
- Yes you can,

579
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,360
- keep on goin'.
- I see it, I see it.

580
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,460
- You're almost there.
- Come on,

581
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,730
- yes, there you go.
- No!

582
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:48,210
- Nice and big one,
come on, let's go.

583
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,600
- Yeah, yeah, here you go,
here you go, here you go.

584
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,730
Here you go, that's it.

585
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:54,200
Congratulations.

586
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,320
- Baby girl, congratulations.
- Cute little baby girl.

587
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,310
- She's beautiful.
- Wow.

588
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:02,280
- Aw, she's beautiful.

589
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,980
Trust me, I got the
better end of this deal.

590
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,990
I have to go, good luck, okay.

591
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:11,420
- Thank you so much.

592
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:13,090
- Thank you, doctor.

593
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,100
- Excuse me.

594
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,230
'Cuse me.

595
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:27,070
'Cuse me.

596
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,490
- I missed you.

597
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:25,460
- What're doin', baby?

598
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,960
- I did what I have to.

599
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:33,400
- I came here to save you.

600
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,570
- No, no, I'm
trying to save you.

601
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,110
- No, this isn't the way.

602
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:48,320
- Please, let me do this,
otherwise I can miss you.

603
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:52,120
- Do you trust me?

604
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:54,890
- Yeah.

605
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:58,390
- Do you love me?

606
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:00,330
- Oh,

607
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:06,630
I do, I love you, I've always
loved you, always loved you.

608
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:22,120
- Trust it will be enough,
we'll see each other again.

609
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:48,180
- Honorable members
of the council,

610
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:52,410
it is my great privilege
to address you today

611
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:56,080
with a body of findings,
even if I do not...

612
00:33:58,650 --> 00:33:59,650
- We warned you.

613
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:09,430
- Ladies and gentlemen, we
have a special guest tonight.

614
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:12,470
It's my pleasure to introduce
to you, Senator Jim Williams.

615
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:21,440
- Thank you, thank you all.

616
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:27,280
We're not quite sure where
Bob Tinker is right now,

617
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,850
but if it's all right with
you, I'll do the honors.

618
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:34,420
You have had a wonderful
and successful year

619
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,860
here at Biocorp.

620
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:43,400
Your hard work has
made the company

621
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:47,200
as powerful and
proficient as it is today.

622
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:53,310
But now, I have had
the honor of being

623
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:57,780
one of the prime architects
in the establishment

624
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:01,020
of a new government
contract with Biocorp.

625
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:09,490
The goal is that you, Biocorp,

626
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,160
will rid the entire world

627
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,800
of crime within
the next 10 years.

628
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,120
- Thomas, where are you?

629
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,790
Thomas, Thomas, Thomas.

630
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:43,360
Oh Thomas, thank god it's you.

631
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,830
- Nico, what're you doing here?

632
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:46,460
- What am I doing?

633
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:49,760
I'm here to stop you from
doing something horrible.

634
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,270
- How do you know about that?

635
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:53,170
- Thomas man, we're not
idiots, we figured it out.

636
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:55,570
- You probably figured out you
can't stop it either, Nico.

637
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,740
- Oh god.
- Nothing can stop it now.

638
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:57,670
- No.

639
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:58,840
- And in the name of God, Nico,

640
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,380
why would you
wanna stop it, huh?

641
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:03,040
Look at these people, they're
murderers, mass murderers,

642
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,510
every single one of 'em.

643
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:06,150
- No, no, they're innocent.

644
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:07,650
- Lauren was innocent!

645
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:09,080
- Look, Lauren wouldn't
want you to be doing this.

646
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,590
- Yes she would Nico,
she'd want me to kill a few

647
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:12,020
to save a billion,
you know she would!

648
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:14,560
- Do you want that on
your conscience, do you?

649
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,930
- It's bigger than us, Nico,
it's bigger than me and you.

650
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:21,260
Okay so just go, let
me do this, go, go.

651
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:25,400
- And what're you gonna do, huh?

652
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,400
It's a bomb, isn't it?

653
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,740
- It doesn't matter what it is!

654
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:29,400
- It's a bomb, isn't it?
- Yes!

655
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,440
- Oh my god, please
Thomas, we've got Lauren.

656
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,880
- No.

657
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,680
- No, we can fix this.
- Stop it, stop it, stop it.

658
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,640
- Thomas, look at me.

659
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,440
- Look at me!
- Stop it.

660
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,580
- She's with the doctor,

661
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:39,550
- we can fix this.
- No, as a baby, right?

662
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:42,080
You went and got her as a
baby, Nico it's not the same.

663
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,420
Nothing is gonna

664
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,650
- change my mind.
- Please come, please come.

665
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:48,960
- No, you, you gotta
go, for me please, go.

666
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:52,630
- Okay, fine, if you
kill these people,

667
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:55,860
then you kill me too, I'm
not leavin' without you.

668
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:58,130
- Then I'm gonna kill
Jenny too, right?

669
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:00,470
'Cause she's in the building
somewhere Nico, right?

670
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:02,570
She's here, right, somewhere?

671
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:04,870
You gonna take that
risk with her life?

672
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:06,810
Don't waste your
time following me,

673
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:09,310
you'll never find that bomb
Nico, you haven't got the time.

674
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,010
- Thomas, Thomas!

675
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,590
Oh my god, where is it?

676
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:21,420
- Was that Thomas?

677
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,920
- Yeah, that was Thomas.

678
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,060
Oh my god, there's a bomb
in here, we need to find it.

679
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:26,730
- It could be anywhere,
Dane's here too.

680
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,370
- What was it, honey?

681
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:31,530
- A baby girl.

682
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:32,730
- And what's...
- Everything's okay.

683
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:34,200
- Okay, that's good,
that's so good.

684
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,640
Okay, we need to
get everyone out.

685
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:39,840
Okay, everyone,
everyone listen up,

686
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,340
- listen to me!
- Listen!

687
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:44,380
- There's a bomb in the
building, we have to leave.

688
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:46,850
Everyone listen to
me, there's a bomb!

689
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:53,460
Get outta here!

690
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:58,460
Get outta here, there's a bomb!

691
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:00,290
There's a bomb, get out!

692
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:04,000
- Okay, come on, we gotta go.

693
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:22,250
Move, move, move!

694
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,960
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- Freeze, don't move!

695
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,290
- Look, look, look,
look okay, we're okay.

696
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,840
- Nico!

697
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,380
- Thomas.

698
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,780
- What have you done?

699
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,950
- Are you crazy?

700
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:27,880
- What have you done?

701
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,380
- We had to stop you.

702
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:32,220
- Stop me, you, you just
totally ruined everything.

703
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:34,420
- Thomas!
- Nico!

704
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,660
- There's still time
Nico to fix this.

705
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,190
Tell me what you
did with the bomb.

706
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:38,590
- You let her go, I swear to
god I'm gonna kill you, man.

707
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:40,130
- You already killed us, Nico.

708
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:42,260
You killed me, you killed
Jenny, you killed Lauren,

709
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:44,730
you killed every single
person we ever loved.

710
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:46,870
And for what, for these people?

711
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:51,040
- Look, look, look I'll figure,
I'll figure something out,

712
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,270
just let her go.

713
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:54,840
- No, Nico, this is
kill or be killed.

714
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,740
Time to man up,
give me the bomb.

715
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,450
- Whoa, whoa, oh,
wait, wait, wait,

716
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:07,390
there's a guy with
a gun in there.

717
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:08,690
He just shot two officers.

718
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:10,790
He's goin' crazy, he's
shootin' everybody.

719
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:34,450
- What was that?

720
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:40,760
Sir, something's wrong.

721
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,490
- What do you
mean, what's wrong?

722
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:44,490
- His
brain activity's all wrong.

723
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:45,460
- What do you mean, wrong?

724
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,730
- His heart rate's slowing too.

725
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:49,060
- Can't anyone here
do anything right?

726
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,600
- Baby, baby, hang in there.

727
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,840
- Okay, I will, okay.

728
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,540
- No, no, no, no, no!

729
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:00,680
- You should go, go.

730
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:03,210
- You know they're gonna send
more people back, Thomas.

731
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,080
You know he's not the end!

732
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,050
I need your help.

733
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:07,850
- To do what, to fix it?

734
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:11,250
I was trying to fix it, Nico,
that's what I was doing!

735
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:13,220
- Not that way, not in that way.

736
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:18,060
We can rebuild the machine,
okay, I just need your help.

737
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,590
I need your help, I need you.

738
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:22,060
- You can find the cause of
the virus before it spreads.

739
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:24,330
- The cause of the
virus was in that room

740
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:26,130
and you let them get away!

741
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:27,300
- We, we can...

742
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,500
- We can what, we can wait

743
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,440
for Biocorp to send back
another guy to kill us?

744
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:35,380
Or send back a guy to kill our
families before we're born!

745
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:37,280
What're we waitin' for?

746
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:42,150
We're waitin' for nothin', Nico.

747
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:45,720
And don't you worry, I'm
gonna fix it my friend.

748
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,820
And I'm gonna ask you
for just one more thing,

749
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:50,060
and then we never have
to see each other.

750
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:55,600
When I fix it,
don't get in my way.

751
00:41:57,130 --> 00:41:59,330
That's the one extra thing.

752
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:05,340
- No, no, Jenny, no!
- We have to stop him, Nico!

753
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:06,270
- No, Jenny.

754
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:07,210
- Get another chance.

755
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:08,910
- Jenny, let him go.

756
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:18,320
- His brain
activity is inactive.

757
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:23,490
His heart rate's flat.

758
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:29,630
- Is there any chance that
he is still alive in 2017?

759
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,770
- No sir, he's uh, he's dead.

760
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,350
- Prepare the clean
sweep protocol.

761
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:45,680
- Do we have the authorization?

762
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,310
- Prep the machines!

763
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:49,250
- Yes, sir.

764
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:53,190
- This whole thing has
spun outta control.

765
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:54,790
How many can we send in?

766
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:56,590
- The speaker says
that by hour's end,

767
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:57,860
they will have completed
enough chambers

768
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:59,430
to send 50 at a time.

769
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:03,700
- 50?

770
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,000
- Yes, Mr. President.

771
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,940
- All right, tell him
to send four waves,

772
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:09,640
soon as possible.

773
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:13,710
- Four, sir, are you aware
of the concern many have?

774
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:15,580
- I'm very well
aware of the dangers.

775
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:19,180
We may be causing
our own annihilation.

776
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,790
But to do nothing, would
mean the same thing.

777
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:44,240
- How do you feel?

778
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,240
- Still alive.

779
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:47,210
- Thankfully.

780
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:51,410
So now what?

781
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:56,180
- I don't know, build a time
machine and head back home.

782
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:58,920
- I still think we
need to stop him.

783
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:01,320
- He's way beyond
our reach, babe.

784
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,890
- He'll kill too many
people before we can

785
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,790
assemble a machine
or fix anything.

786
00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:08,900
We need to stop him, Nico.

787
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:12,900
Dammit.

788
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:13,900
- What is it?

789
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:17,100
- Oh my god.

790
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:19,670
- Oh they didn't
even wait a day?

791
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:23,110
Are they close?

792
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:24,610
- No, thank god.

793
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:26,480
- Wait, why is it
doin' this, is it broken?

794
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:30,150
- I hope so,
because if it isn't,

795
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:33,650
they just sent a
shitload of people back.

796
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:55,480
- Think I'm going
to like it here.
