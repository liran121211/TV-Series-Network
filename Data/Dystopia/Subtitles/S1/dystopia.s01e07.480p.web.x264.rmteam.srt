1
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:13,100
Previously on Dystopia.

2
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,260
- You mentioned a list?

3
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:15,500
- We need their addresses.

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,730
There's eight of
them that are pivotal

5
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,240
to the Biocorp project
that we're dealing with

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,470
and they're a huge key to
the launch of the virus.

7
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:23,040
We are getting close.

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,640
- 30 attempts, 30
dead volunteers,

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,180
that's what you call close.

10
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,280
- Yeah, but are you
sure that's the right guy?

11
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,210
- It's definitely the right guy.

12
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,580
- All right, change the future,

13
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:34,420
but you can not change the past.

14
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:40,960
- You're in our future.

15
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,190
She has something in common.

16
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:44,190
Infertility.

17
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,400
And that pain and that anguish
that you feel right now,

18
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,170
multiply that by
6,000,000,000 people

19
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:53,470
and you have what happens in
our world, because of you.

20
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,900
- Have her strapped
into the machine.

21
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,740
- Do you really
think I hate you so much

22
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,010
I'd kill the woman I love?

23
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,410
I'd do anything for her.

24
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,920
- And now for
tonight's top story.

25
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,190
Today Nobel Peace Prize
winning Biocorp made history

26
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:11,520
by administering
the cure for cancer,

27
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,820
available to the entire
world's population

28
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,890
in exchange for their
compulsory enrollment

29
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:18,230
in the I.D. Chip
Program, which allows for

30
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:20,460
increased population security.

31
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,000
Bio Corp CEO stated, we are
at the precipice of change,

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,540
which always feels unnerving,
but what changes we make today

33
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,870
will echo in time and our
children will thank us

34
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,540
for embracing the new world.

35
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,680
That's all for tonight.

36
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,780
- And we're all clear.

37
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,520
- Hi babe.

38
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:44,520
- Was it a good news day?

39
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,390
- I don't know baby, we're
gonna have to wait and see.

40
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:49,190
- When will we know?

41
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:51,900
- I guess we'll find out
by the end of the day.

42
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,630
Now I heard that my baby wants
some chocolate ice cream.

43
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:56,470
- Yeah.

44
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:57,300
- Mrs. Adams.

45
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,500
- Yes.

46
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,740
- I'm David Johnson
from Biocorp.

47
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,510
It's time for your
I.D. chip enrollment.

48
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,740
- That was fast.

49
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,140
- We believe that
the media should be

50
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,380
the first to jump on
board, set a great example.

51
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,380
- Of course.

52
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:11,850
Come on, baby.

53
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,530
- Track the microchip.

54
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:24,990
Find Nico.

55
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,400
- What are you saying to her?

56
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,900
- I'm just trying
to help her relax.

57
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,570
She has to be in a coma like
state before she goes through.

58
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,310
Now remember, you
only have an hour

59
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,280
to put yourself to sleep
before we pull you back in.

60
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,610
Don't waste time exploring.

61
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,350
Find Nico and come home.

62
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,690
- Watch everything
he does, gentlemen.

63
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,260
Jenny connected.

64
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,690
Displacement initiated.

65
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,100
- Did it work?

66
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,200
- Her brain activity
is comparable

67
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,240
with somebody who's awake.

68
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,370
- What does that mean?

69
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,010
- It means it worked.

70
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:12,910
She's in the past.

71
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,080
- What year?

72
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,220
- 2017.

73
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,480
- Excellent, bring her back.

74
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,520
- But we have to
wait the full hour.

75
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,950
- Pull her back right now.

76
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,250
- If you pull her
back now, she'll die.

77
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,860
- I find that of little concern.

78
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,090
Bring her back now.

79
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,090
- Well then you won't
know if the machine

80
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:03,430
is working properly or not.

81
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,800
You wanna know if it works?

82
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,400
We gotta do it right.

83
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,800
- Don't toy with me, son.

84
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:17,810
- She has 55 minutes.

85
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,800
- What are you typing?

86
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,800
- I'm taking notes on
her brain activity,

87
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,570
her heart rate, her temperature
and her blood pressure

88
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:20,870
just to make sure there's
no significant changes.

89
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,140
- I trust all you gentlemen

90
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,170
are paying attention
here please?

91
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:26,810
- We're getting
it all down, sir.

92
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:31,550
- So if this all works, I
decided not to execute you.

93
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,250
And instead have you
work for Biocorp,

94
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,890
but I will agree to
release her, if it works.

95
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,060
Well you can think about
it, but it's easy really,

96
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,190
live and work for
Biocorp, or die.

97
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,660
- The deal we had...

98
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,630
- The deal's changed, keep up.

99
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,140
- What are you
planning to do with it?

100
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,340
You could destroy everything
by meddling with the past.

101
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,540
- I didn't create it.

102
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,410
Those were your
meddlesome friends.

103
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:01,080
You think they
had lofty motives.

104
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,150
I'm sure they're
creating havoc already.

105
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,520
- No, they stumbled
on it by accident.

106
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,150
- Oh yes, this is
clearly all an accident.

107
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,390
- No, it's true.

108
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,590
They didn't want any
of this to happen.

109
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:13,620
- Well, be that as it may,

110
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:17,690
I will use it to go back and
change things for the better.

111
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:20,700
- Tampering with the past could
threaten our very existence.

112
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,300
Look, I will do everything
you want, but she has to live.

113
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,970
- Why would you risk
your life for her?

114
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:33,080
- Cause that's just what
friends do for one another.

115
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,210
- Friends?

116
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:38,280
The word friend has
no true meaning here.

117
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,620
We are creatures
of want and need.

118
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,620
Those you call friends
merely satisfy you.

119
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,960
- I think you're confused.

120
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,130
Just put the gun
down and we can talk.

121
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,600
- Tell me about Biocorps.

122
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,530
- I told you, I don't
know anything about that.

123
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:55,360
- You're lying.

124
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,330
This is all your fault.

125
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:57,530
You're probably one of her.

126
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:58,770
You started the whole
thing, didn't you?

127
00:06:58,770 --> 00:06:59,570
You tried it on your
child, didn't you?

128
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:00,800
- No, you're crazy.

129
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,010
- You think you're
better than us?

130
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:03,610
I am crazy, but you're
a genocidal stain.

131
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:05,170
You're a genocidal stain!

132
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,050
Listen to me, listen to me.

133
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,320
If you even come close to
making Bio Corp succeed

134
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,520
or support them, I
swear I will kill you.

135
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,690
Do you understand?

136
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:19,560
Say you understand!

137
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,590
- I understand.

138
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:21,660
I understand.

139
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,300
- All right, enough time.

140
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,100
Do it now.

141
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:32,940
- No, it's not time.

142
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:33,870
- Do it now.

143
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,070
- Look at her brain activity.

144
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,440
- I don't care.

145
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,070
Do what I say.

146
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,810
- Her brain wave patterns
say she's not asleep yet.

147
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,810
If you wake her up
now, it'll kill her.

148
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,710
- I think you two
are up to something.

149
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:45,080
- You told me to run
the machine properly.

150
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,420
You knew that she
has to be in stasis.

151
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:50,790
- And now I'm telling
you to bring her back.

152
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,620
- What is the point of
knowing how it works

153
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,320
if you won't let me
show you how it works?

154
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,430
That's insane!

155
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:58,530
- Do it now.

156
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,330
- I will not kill her.

157
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,730
- You're not looking to kill.

158
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,330
You're buying time.

159
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,070
Step aside, you're finished.

160
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,070
- What do you want
me to do with him?

161
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,710
- Kill him.

162
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:14,480
I won't have people
barking orders at me

163
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,310
like I'm one of their pets.

164
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:19,220
- How will you figure the exact
way to bring someone back?

165
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,050
- Try on her.

166
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,360
- Jenny?

167
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,500
Oh my gosh.

168
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,900
Oh, I can't believe it's you.

169
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:45,510
- It's done.

170
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,480
- Why then?

171
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,440
To happen to you?

172
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,850
- Jenny, my God.

173
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:53,680
Is Lauren with you?

174
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,280
- No, she...

175
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,690
- What happened, Jenny?

176
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:58,690
- I shot her.

177
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,820
- You shot... I shot her.

178
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,460
Who do you think
Biocorp, the speaker...

179
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:05,860
- What the hell happened to her?

180
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,260
- I can't explain now.

181
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,200
Biocorp is at the apartment
and they're going to

182
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,270
pull me back in six minutes.

183
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,870
- Sir, I think we should let him

184
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,370
finish showing the scientist.

185
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:14,770
He may be the only one left
who really knows the machine.

186
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:17,010
- He and that girl are
plotting against us

187
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,010
right now in the past.

188
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,280
- They had no time to plan that.

189
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,450
- You and I commander,
we're alive in 2017.

190
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:25,480
She could be hovering
over our young bodies,

191
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,550
planning to kill
us in our sleep.

192
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,150
- I hope she is.

193
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:28,990
- You see?

194
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,150
- You're all the same,

195
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,190
power hungry men without
a brain among you.

196
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:38,190
- And you're all the same,
so fierce in your convictions

197
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,800
as though they might save you.

198
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:43,900
- All due respect, sir,

199
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,370
I think we should let the
brain activity go to stasis,

200
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:47,370
like he says.

201
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,120
- Very well.

202
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,020
- Nico, look, I love
you and I miss you,

203
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,490
but you have to let me go.

204
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:11,630
- No, I'm not gonna lose you.

205
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:14,060
- I don't want to go either,
but you have to knock me out.

206
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,330
- No, I don't know what
you're talking about.

207
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:16,870
- They're gonna wake
me in five minutes.

208
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,600
- No, no, David's not gonna
do that unless it's safe.

209
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,970
- David has a gun to his...

210
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:21,300
- No, I'm not going
to lose you again.

211
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,240
- We have no other choice.

212
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,870
Please, you have to let me go.

213
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,440
Just put me under.

214
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,810
- Prepare the
adrenaline syringe.

215
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:28,240
Let's get this process going.

216
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,380
- You can't kill her.

217
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,910
- I told you, you're finished.

218
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:33,850
- Wait, if I, if you, let
her live, I will help you.

219
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,280
I will tell you everything
about the machine.

220
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,920
I will work for Biocorp
like you wanted.

221
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,190
With my help, you
can use this device

222
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,390
to take over the world.

223
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,530
There are secrets
about this machine

224
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:47,260
that I will tell you
only if you let her live.

225
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,230
- Really?

226
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,840
All right.

227
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,840
Except, you will tell
us these secrets now

228
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,980
or I guarantee you,
I will let her die.

229
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,210
- Why can't I just
stay here with you?

230
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:02,410
- No, no, no, no, you can't.

231
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:03,250
- Why not?

232
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,610
- You can't because,

233
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:07,050
because if you're asleep
there, you might die.

234
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:08,050
- I don't care.

235
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,020
I want to be with you.

236
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,260
I want to be with
the man that I love.

237
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,360
- I love you.

238
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,630
- I'm so sorry about Lauren.

239
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,400
- It's not your fault.

240
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,600
It's not your fault.

241
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,600
It's okay.

242
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,570
- David, he risked
his life for her.

243
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:27,400
- It's not your fault, baby.

244
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,600
- They just,

245
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,640
they killed her in cold blood.

246
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,840
- It's okay, just stay with me.

247
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,780
Stay with me, okay?

248
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,780
Just be with me.

249
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,780
- I am.

250
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,110
I am.

251
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,150
- Please, just let
her fall asleep.

252
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,720
You know this will kill her.

253
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,650
- What are these secrets?

254
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:44,050
- Wake her up properly first.

255
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,760
- We know the machine works.

256
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,620
We have enough
information to carry on

257
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,130
without you or without her.

258
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:53,700
What are the secrets?

259
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,900
- You do this, I'll never tell.

260
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,040
- You've got nothing.

261
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:02,710
The adrenaline.

262
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:03,540
- Wait.

263
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,370
- Tell me the secrets.

264
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:05,780
- I will when you,

265
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,500
wait, wait, wait, without
me, you will fail.

266
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:15,050
Back, back, back, back!

267
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:16,790
Get back, go farther!

268
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,230
- Shots fired, move, move, move!

269
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:31,770
- No, no, no!

270
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:46,780
- She'll live.

271
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:51,220
In a better future.

272
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:57,130
- No, no!

273
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,140
How could you let this happen?

274
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:07,970
- You all right?

275
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:09,210
- My head.

276
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:10,410
- I remember this
headache, it's okay.

277
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:11,640
- What?

278
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,940
Are, are they trying to wake me?

279
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:16,480
- They disconnected you, honey.

280
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,480
- How?

281
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,450
- They must have had no choice.

282
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:22,920
You're here now.

283
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,420
You shouldn't go back.

284
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,420
- I don't care, I don't care.

285
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,260
I just want to be with you.

286
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,690
- I know, I know.

287
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:30,430
It's okay.

288
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,700
We need to find Thomas, babe.

289
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:36,470
- She loved him.

290
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:38,330
You know that, don't you?

291
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,470
She loved you.

292
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,950
- Move it now,
take your corners.

293
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,550
- Oh, thank heavens

294
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,780
Like usual, you're just in time.

295
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,330
Get me a new team and
get rid of these bodies.

296
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:12,330
- Yes sir.

297
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,770
What now?

298
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,310
- What now?

299
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:19,080
I don't know, but thanks to you,

300
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,140
we do know how to go one way.

301
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,560
- Hello.

302
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,960
- Hello, is
this Mrs. Kyla Torres?

303
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,460
- Yes, speaking.

304
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,760
- Mrs. Torres, this
is Dr. Raymond Prentice,

305
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,230
at the New Jersey
fertility center.

306
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,530
- Yes, hello doctor,
how are you doing?

307
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:47,570
- Very well,
thank you for asking.

308
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:49,340
I'm calling in regards
to the recent tests

309
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,440
that you've undergone
here at the hospital.

310
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,210
- Yes, yes, doctor.

311
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:54,980
How'd they come out?

312
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,180
- Well Mrs. Torres,

313
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:00,120
I'm sorry to have
to tell you this,

314
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,790
there's really no easy
way of saying it but,

315
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,050
all of the tests have come back

316
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:06,290
and they're fairly conclusive.

317
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:09,460
In fact, they are
100% conclusive.

318
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,960
I'm afraid you are
completely infertile.

319
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,900
Beyond adoption or surrogacy,

320
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,930
I'm afraid you will
never have children.

321
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:29,650
Mrs Torres, I am...

322
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:30,650
Mrs. Torres?

323
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,250
Mrs. Torres, are you there?

324
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:35,450
Mrs. Torres.

325
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:36,550
- You are our future.

326
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,920
She has something in common.

327
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,920
Infertility.

328
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,560
- Oh my God.

329
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:47,600
He was right.

330
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:50,970
He was right.

331
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,040
- Hey Thomas.

332
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,840
Thomas.

333
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,080
Are you crazy?

334
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,640
Put the gun down.

335
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,010
- We're committed
here, Nico, right?

336
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:06,920
We came here with a job to do

337
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,950
and now we have to finish it.

338
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:11,120
- Right, but put the gun down.

339
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,190
What did you lose your mind?

340
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,230
- Where's Jenny?

341
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,800
- She's uh,

342
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,170
she's in the motel.

343
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:31,610
- How is she still here?

344
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,680
- David, he's uh,

345
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,010
he did what he had to do.

346
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:40,180
She's here with us now.

347
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,020
- Lucky me.

348
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:46,020
Always the third wheel.

349
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:49,360
- It's gonna be okay, bud.

350
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,230
- I feel so alone, Nico,

351
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:56,070
in a way I thought
I'd never feel.

352
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,600
- We're in this together.

353
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,600
- I know.

354
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,140
- We're gonna find a way home.

355
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,150
- What are we going home to?

356
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:14,020
- The future.

357
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,880
The future buddy.

358
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,650
We've got the future.

359
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,520
- The future.

360
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:23,990
The future?

361
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,400
You have your future!

362
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,230
You have Jenny!

363
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,200
You have everything!

364
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,530
Lauren is gone!

365
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,300
A future without Lauren?

366
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,740
For me?

367
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,300
There is nothing left to see.

368
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,540
- I understand, but...

369
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,770
- No, no.

370
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:39,740
No you don't.

371
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,680
No you don't.

372
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,010
I get that you loved her.

373
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:43,450
I get that she's your sister.

374
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:45,750
I really do, I really do,

375
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,980
but you did not love her.

376
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,920
- Look, that is not my fault.

377
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,190
That is not my fault!

378
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:52,420
- Yes it is because you
allowed this to happen!

379
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,820
We left them and
we shouldn't have.

380
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,070
I'm sorry.

381
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,070
I'm sorry.

382
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:06,570
I didn't mean to, I'm sorry.

383
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,080
- Okay, it's all right.

384
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,110
- No, I'm not blaming you.

385
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:21,580
I know exactly, exactly
where the blame lies.

386
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:24,150
- We need to get our
heads straight, okay?

387
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,620
We're in danger.

388
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,920
- We're in danger?

389
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,320
- No, Jenny told me everything.

390
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,260
They got the machine.

391
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,760
They're sending people back.

392
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,800
They're gonna be quick and
they're gonna be brutal.

393
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,160
- It doesn't matter.

394
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,430
It doesn't matter,
Nico, you hear?

395
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,330
Biocorp aren't the bully.

396
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:39,600
Here, we're the killers.

397
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,640
Biocorp, they're just babies.

398
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,910
- We're not killers.

399
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:46,410
We're not killers.

400
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:49,250
- Yes we are Nico.

401
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,680
We've killed.

402
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,120
How many people have we killed?

403
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,250
So many I don't even remember.

404
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,750
And we need to kill a few more.

405
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:57,690
You know what we need to do?

406
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:59,960
We need to kill just a few more.

407
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,160
We have to kill every
employee, every colleague,

408
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,390
every investor, every
friend, every mother,

409
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:07,330
every child of anything
to do with Biocorp.

410
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:09,100
We have to leave
no place standing.

411
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:15,140
- We didn't move here to
kill children, Thomas.

412
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,210
- If we leave Biocorp
standing, Nico,

413
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,110
that's exactly what we do.

414
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:36,690
- The global biological
clock is ticking against us.

415
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:41,300
At this time,

416
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:46,340
- Almost as if I
wrote it myself.

417
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,540
- I can't believe
everyone thinks

418
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,270
that's the real John Williams.

419
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:53,380
- Well, I'm not interested
in being famous.

420
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,580
I just wanna fix
this big mess here.

421
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:07,790
- Kyla.

422
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:11,690
- Oh, you again.

423
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,130
- Me again.

424
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,730
- I just want you to know,
I haven't done anything.

425
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:17,900
I haven't done anything wrong.

426
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,900
- Kyla,

427
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,100
I'm not here about that today.

428
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:24,870
- Okay, well, I took your
warning very seriously

429
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:27,080
and its been all
I can think about

430
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,180
and I even went to...

431
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,010
- Kyla, Kyla.

432
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:29,950
- What?

433
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:31,350
- I'm here to ask for a favor.

434
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:33,550
- What?

435
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,720
- I need you to
help me with access

436
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,290
to the Biocorp internal network.

437
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,730
- No, I, I, I can't...

438
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,090
Oh my God, holy...

439
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:46,230
- Shut up.

440
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:47,700
- Shut up, Kyla.
- Calm down.

441
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,330
- Stop talking!

442
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:54,270
I need the names and addresses
of every Biocorp employee.

443
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,700
- What, why do you need that?

444
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:59,170
- Stop talking and
start listening!

445
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:00,410
- Okay...

446
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:01,640
- Because the more you
talk, the angrier I get,

447
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,710
and the angrier I get,
the more I remember

448
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:06,150
you killed a whole
load of my friends

449
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,580
and then I just want to
blow your brains out.

450
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,850
- Okay, okay, okay.

451
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:13,690
We can access it
from my house, okay?

452
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:14,920
We can do that.

453
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,460
We can do that at
my house, okay?

454
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,290
Okay?

455
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:19,230
- Is this your car?

456
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,060
- Yes, yes, it's right here.

457
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,860
- Yeah.
- Then let's go.

458
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:26,740
- Okay.

459
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,740
- After you.

460
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,740
- You know what, you
really don't need that.

461
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:50,060
- Actually I do because I don't
trust anybody or anything.

462
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:53,900
- I told you that
you can trust me.

463
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,200
- After seeing what you
become in the future?

464
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,300
Why, I'll pass.

465
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:06,380
- So what, no faith that humans
can change for the better?

466
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,080
- Not really.

467
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,780
- What happened to you?

468
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,620
What made you so
goddamn cynical?

469
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,520
- Oh nothing big,

470
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,960
just all my friends
and all my family died.

471
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,560
Everybody I've ever
known is gonna die

472
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,360
and the woman I
love, I left to die.

473
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:32,740
I saw society tear
itself apart for an idea

474
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,170
that was supposed to save us,

475
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,140
all from your company.

476
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:41,080
- But that's not my fault.

477
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,210
- Actually, it is.

478
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,150
But you can change that.

479
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:48,780
Put all the information on this.

480
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:02,730
- Whatever you want.

481
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:11,870
Okay.

482
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,340
This is everything.

483
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,340
Done.

484
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,350
- Well done, Kyla.

485
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:21,550
What you're doing
is saving lives,

486
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:24,020
starting with your own.

487
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,820
Don't forget what I said.

488
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,260
Don't do anything stupid.

489
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:32,730
- I promise.

490
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,160
- We'll see.

491
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:50,850
- God, give me the serenity
to accept the things

492
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:55,750
I cannot change and the courage
to change the things I can

493
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:58,050
and the wisdom to
know the difference.

494
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,690
Oh my...

495
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:13,670
Commander.

496
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:14,670
- Sir.

497
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,840
- Report.

498
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,880
- We completed
repairs on the machine

499
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,580
and after reviewing
David's notes,

500
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:24,150
I think we're ready to successfully
send back a volunteer.

501
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,680
- Well done.

502
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:31,190
Hm.

503
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:35,490
Hm.

504
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:37,830
You may proceed.

505
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,200
I'll inform the president.

506
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,200
- Yes, sir.

507
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:04,220
- Hey, you okay?

508
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,490
- Yeah, I'll be okay.

509
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,290
- She died trying
to save your life.

510
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:13,500
She never gave up,

511
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,500
not until the end.

512
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,370
So stubborn.

513
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:21,400
She kind of reminds
me of someone.

514
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:24,210
- I know he loved her.

515
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:27,710
Our father loved her
so much more than me.

516
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:30,550
I was pretty much
invisible to him.

517
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:34,680
I think that's why I
hated her growing up.

518
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,250
Well that and she
used to steal my toys.

519
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,360
- Well you got over
that eventually, right?

520
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,420
Yeah.

521
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,420
Yeah, I did.

522
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,960
You know, for the
longest time, she was,

523
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,730
she was my only friend.

524
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,800
- And you
meant the world to her.

525
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,140
- God, it's my fault.

526
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,070
- No, it's not.

527
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,280
- I shouldn't have left, honey.

528
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,180
- You had to.

529
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,480
- No, I had a choice.

530
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:05,350
- Here she comes.

531
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,350
- No, no, just,

532
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:12,020
look, I knew they were
going to raid the apartment.

533
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,860
I felt it in my gut
and you know what?

534
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,360
I still took the chance on it.

535
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:18,060
I left you guys alone and

536
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:20,600
her and, I don't,

537
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,230
we went on a stupid mission
to save the world and

538
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:26,600
just made everything worse.

539
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,270
- No, you did what
you had to do.

540
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,210
- A lot of people
have had to die.

541
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,180
A lot.

542
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,550
- Babe, you are a good man.

543
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:40,620
You've always been a good man.

544
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,150
- How do you know?

545
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:44,550
- Because I married you and
I see it day in and day out.

546
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,390
And if what I say isn't
enough to convince you,

547
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:50,990
just know that the doctor
told me that you are too.

548
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:51,990
- He made it?

549
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,800
- Yeah, he was in our time.

550
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:57,830
He helped us.

551
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:02,070
- I didn't think he'd
remember after all this time.

552
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,010
- How could he forget?

553
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:04,540
You saved his father's life.

554
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,470
- That was Thomas.

555
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:07,140
- No, it was both of you.

556
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,710
He hadn't seen you in 20 years

557
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,250
and he still gave his
last moments to you.

558
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:12,780
Doesn't that speak volumes?

559
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:15,280
- Yeah, but you know, just,

560
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,790
it's just been hard.

561
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:18,870
A lot of people have had to
die so we can save lives.

562
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,260
- I know.

563
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,260
It's been hard for all of us.

564
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,360
- And Thomas, he's...

565
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,360
- Thomas,

566
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,530
he doesn't have it anymore.

567
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:30,730
He never really did.

568
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,240
- I don't know
what he's gonna do.

569
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,940
- It's Thomas we're
talking about.

570
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:42,610
- Hello.

571
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:44,180
Hi.

572
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:47,520
What is it that you have there?

573
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,420
- It's my ladybug.

574
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,820
- Oh, it's a big one.

575
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,890
- It's the biggest
I've ever seen.

576
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,820
- It's pretty.

577
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,490
- I'm gonna take
it home as a pet.

578
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:59,960
- Oh, that's nice of you.

579
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,060
- My brother's gonna hate it.

580
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,870
He doesn't like
creepy crawly things.

581
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:06,070
- Your brother.

582
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,670
I bet he's nice too.

583
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:09,470
- Not when he's sleepy.

584
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,110
Do you want to hold it?

585
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:16,240
- Who me?

586
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,980
- Yes you, silly.

587
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:18,980
- Okay.

588
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,650
Wow, she's pretty like you.

589
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:27,690
- Can I have it back now?

590
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:28,920
Yeah, sure.

591
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:31,090
There you go.

592
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:33,230
- I have to go feed her.

593
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:35,600
- You know, lettuce
is good for ladybugs.

594
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,000
- How do you know?

595
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,600
- How do I know?

596
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,540
I mean, I used to have
a ladybug as a pet.

597
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,370
- Really?

598
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:42,600
- Yeah.

599
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,410
My sister used to
bring 'em home to me

600
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:44,710
when I was a little boy.

601
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:46,780
- That's what I do.

602
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:49,010
- Sweetie, time to go.

603
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,910
- I have to go now.

604
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:52,820
Bye.

605
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:53,820
- Okay, bye bye.

606
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:33,020
- What's for dinner?

607
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:36,190
- Oh my God, okay.

608
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:38,560
So are you trying to
give me a heart attack?

609
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,160
- Perhaps.

610
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,830
- What do you want now?

611
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:42,830
What?

612
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,900
- I see why you're
childless, Kyla.

613
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:49,170
- Why, because I can't cook?

614
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:51,870
- No, because you
don't deserve one.

615
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,740
- What,

616
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:55,740
wait,

617
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,450
wait, did something happen?

618
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,850
- Oh yes.

619
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:03,150
Things have changed, Kyla.

620
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:08,120
- I gave you
everything you wanted.

621
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,360
I gave it to you all,
I gave it to you...

622
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,960
- Not quite, sh, sh,
sh, sh, sh, not quite.

623
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,960
You left out a vital
piece of information

624
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,200
and I'm not sure why.

625
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,740
- I don't know what you're...

626
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,240
What are you doing?

627
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,370
- I asked you for a list of
every single Biocorp employee.

628
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:27,440
- Okay, okay.

629
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,010
- And what did you give me?

630
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:30,150
Everybody in the U.S.?

631
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:32,710
- Wait, um...

632
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:34,080
- Why would you do that?

633
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,220
- Because I just
wasn't thinking clearly

634
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,350
and you're always
holding a gun to my head

635
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:41,590
and you didn't ask me
exactly what you wanted.

636
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,430
Okay, okay, okay.

637
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:44,790
- Well, I need everybody.

638
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:47,230
So do you understand
what I want?

639
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:48,960
- Okay, yes, yes, yes.

640
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,270
- Then get it for me, Kyla.

641
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:53,500
- Okay, I can do that.

642
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,500
Okay, okay.

643
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,870
Okay.

644
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:08,780
Okay.

645
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,260
- Did I ever tell you, Kyla,

646
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:19,260
that you really remind me
of somebody I once knew?

647
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:22,560
- No.

648
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,570
- She had beautiful
eyes, just like you.

649
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:28,440
Smile that could
light up a room.

650
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:32,370
But she's not here anymore

651
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,180
because of you people.

652
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,550
- Okay.

653
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:45,950
Okay.

654
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:47,820
Okay.

655
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:51,290
- How long, Kyla?

656
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,800
- Okay, it's coming.

657
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,530
It's coming right now.

658
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:57,100
Okay, just give me one,

659
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,770
just give me,

660
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:00,100
okay, that's all.

661
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,100
Okay,

662
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:05,040
it's coming out, okay?

663
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,040
Okay.

664
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:07,870
Okay.

665
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:12,450
These are all of the Biocorp
employees in the world.

666
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:14,350
Tokyo, London, and Paris,
you have everything now.

667
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,080
It's in your hands, that's it.

668
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:16,920
I gave you everything
you wanted.

669
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,920
That's it.

670
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:20,820
- So there's nobody
missing from this list?

671
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,260
- No, no.

672
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,990
I promise, this is it.

673
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:25,230
I promise.

674
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:27,030
- I believe you.

675
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,060
You wouldn't lie
to me, would you?

676
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,000
- No.

677
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,170
No, no, I told you, I told you.

678
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:32,000
I told you.

679
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,140
You can trust me.

680
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:38,710
- Sorry Kyla, just can't
take the risk anymore.

681
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,490
- Commander.

682
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:51,750
- Our volunteer's
ready to go, sir.

683
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,490
- There's a change of plans.

684
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:54,960
- Sir?

685
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,890
- The president demanded
that we no longer waste time,

686
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:01,230
instructed me to
send my best soldier

687
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:03,830
to hunt down and kill
these three traitors

688
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:05,430
if they are still alive.

689
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,840
- I'll complete this mission
for Biocorp personally, sir.

690
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,070
- Commander, I am
counting on it.

691
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:18,410
- You're dismissed, get out.

692
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:26,720
- So I believe he shot that girl

693
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,790
because he knew she
would be disconnected

694
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:31,430
and safe in 27 days.

695
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,130
- I agree with that logic.

696
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:35,960
I think they must
all still be alive.

697
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:39,730
- You must find them.

698
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,240
- And then?

699
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:46,870
Yes sir.

700
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,980
- Son, is it ready?

701
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,350
- Yes, sir.

702
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:54,280
- Well give it to him.

703
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,650
- Yes, sir.

704
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:56,650
- Thank you.

705
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,350
- What's this?

706
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:02,020
- I'm assuming they did what
they were supposed to do.

707
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,230
This will allow you to find

708
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:05,330
every member of
the Biocorp family.

709
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:07,290
- Chip locator?

710
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,200
- Well, we'll see.

711
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:11,930
Young man, does this work?

712
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:16,470
- Working perfectly, sir.

713
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:17,470
- Yes.

714
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:20,880
Commander, we are pulling
you back in 24 hours.

715
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,180
If you don't accomplish
your mission by then,

716
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:27,380
don't bother to put
yourself to sleep.

717
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,380
Understand?

718
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,520
- Understood.

719
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,520
- Good luck.

720
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,960
Let's start this
process, please.

721
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,010
(Dramatic orchestral music)

722
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,510
- Thomas,

723
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:01,580
hello, please call
me back, okay?

724
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:02,580
We've been,

725
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:05,020
we've been calling
you for hours.

726
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:08,760
All right, please call me.

727
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,630
- I hope he's okay.

728
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:12,630
- Yeah.

729
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,100
- Maybe he just needs
time alone, you know,

730
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,630
after everything that happened.

731
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:21,840
- I didn't go run and hide.

732
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,040
Son of a bitch.

733
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,340
- Nico, everyone
mourns differently.

734
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,410
- Yeah, but he could
have at least called me.

735
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:33,580
Where the hell have you been?

736
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,550
- I've been talking
care of things

737
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:38,750
that need to be taken care of.

738
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:40,660
And getting a little
drunk on the way.

739
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:42,860
- Where did you go?

740
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:45,130
- I killed Kyla.

741
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:46,060
- Who?

742
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,730
- An infertile Biocorp employee.

743
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:48,560
- Thomas you can just go...

744
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,800
- Why not?

745
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:53,600
She had information we needed,

746
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,440
now I have it.

747
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,000
And she understood.

748
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,470
- What about second chances?

749
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:00,740
- There's no second
chances anymore, Nico.

750
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:06,810
- What's this?

751
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:08,050
Huh?

752
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:10,150
- That's the name and
address and next of kin

753
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:13,720
of every Biocorp employee
in the whole wide world.

754
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,060
- How many people
are on this list?

755
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:17,060
- 1,980.

756
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:18,890
- Dear God.

757
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:24,030
Thomas, there's no way
we're gonna convince

758
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:26,500
that many people of anything.

759
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,770
- I'm not trying to talk
anybody into anything anymore.

760
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:30,910
- What do you mean?

761
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:33,240
- What he means, Jenny,

762
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,280
he's talking about killing
all of these people.

763
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,540
- What?

764
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,550
- What, are you a
mass murderer now?

765
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:39,550
Is that it?

766
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:42,320
- You know what?

767
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,820
I haven't been here
long enough to hear

768
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,650
your two guys' plan, but if
it's any better than mine,

769
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:46,890
I'm all ears.

770
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:48,120
- Well you know,
any plan is better

771
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,720
than killing 2,000
people, Thomas.

772
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,490
- Those people on that list,

773
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:53,560
they deserve to die.

774
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,500
They don't deserve to be,

775
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,730
are you kidding me?

776
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:58,530
Have you forgotten
what they did to us?

777
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
- What they will do.

778
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:03,310
- What?

779
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:05,340
- They haven't done
anything yet, Thomas.

780
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,740
- But they will.

781
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:08,980
- Oh God, so wait,
you're the judge,

782
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:11,380
the jury, and the
executioner now?

783
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,380
Is that what you want?

784
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:14,050
- You're judging me again?

785
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:15,480
- Yeah.

786
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,650
Talking down to me because
I got slightly more

787
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:18,820
blood on my hands than you do?

788
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,460
No, I've never quite
been able to get up

789
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:22,360
to that Nico standard
as usual, no...

790
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,190
- I've never said that.

791
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,190
- No, I've let you down.

792
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,390
I'm not good enough for you.

793
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:26,390
I've never been
good enough for you.

794
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:27,860
- I've never done that!

795
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:30,100
- And I've never been good
enough for your sister either.

796
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,900
- You keep her out of this.

797
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,700
- What a surprise.

798
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:35,870
We're not gonna talk about her.

799
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:37,070
- Both of you just stop.

800
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:42,640
- Listen, Thomas, we don't
have the time or the resources

801
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,650
to reach out to all these
people on the globe.

802
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:48,820
- Then we wait for a time
when everyone on that list

803
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,750
is in the same place,
at the same time,

804
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:51,920
which isn't as hard
as you might think.

805
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,390
Don't you worry, buddy,
I got it covered.

806
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,320
- You need to stop drinking.

807
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,390
Gimme that drink, that's enough.

808
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:59,960
- I haven't had nearly
enough to drink.

809
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:03,930
And that is still a good plan.

810
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:05,300
- What about this
butterfly effect

811
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,630
you always talk about, huh?

812
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:08,270
That's 2,000 people.

813
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:09,640
That's a lot bigger than
what you're talking about!

814
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,870
- I don't know, but
isn't it worth trying?

815
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:14,010
Just think about it, guys.

816
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:16,240
Please for a minute,
think about it.

817
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,950
If everybody on that list
goes, Biocorp is gone.

818
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:21,050
It doesn't exist.

819
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,280
Our home is safe.

820
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,690
We can go home and we
can toast to a world

821
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:27,220
without genocidal
criminals at our doorstep!

822
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,820
- You're calling them genocidal?

823
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,530
- Absolutely.

824
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:33,700
- And what does that make you?

825
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,960
- A goddamn hero.

826
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:36,960
Jenny please,

827
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:38,870
wait, Jenny.

828
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,470
The names on this list,
all the information

829
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:44,940
is enough to save
the whole world

830
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,270
and all we have to
do is execute it.

831
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:48,780
That's it, please.

832
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:53,880
- Look, I am not killing
2,000 people, Thomas.

833
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:57,490
- But it will save 6,000,000,000
so what does it matter?

834
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:00,150
What is there to think about?

835
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:01,560
This is a no brainer.

836
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,760
- It's a coward solution!

837
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,490
- It's simple statistics, Nico.

838
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:05,330
- You need to sober up.

839
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:07,660
- It will save Lauren.

840
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:09,460
It will save Lauren.

841
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:10,700
Do you get that?

842
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,070
- Do you know what
the professor said?

843
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:13,800
We cannot change the past.

844
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,870
- I'm not trying
to change the past.

845
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:15,840
I'm trying to fix our future.

846
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:19,510
- That's this future, Thomas.

847
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:21,780
What we experienced
was the future, okay?

848
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,550
What happened, happened.

849
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:25,950
- No, no, cause we're here
and we're changing things

850
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:27,150
all the time, every minute.

851
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,420
- Yes, I know we're
changing things.

852
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:30,520
We're changing the
future, not the past.

853
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,990
- You know that
for sure, do you?

854
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,060
You don't know that.

855
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,360
So you won't even try?

856
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:44,900
And you?

857
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:49,000
Then I'll do it alone
and I'll save us.

858
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,810
- I'll save us all.
- So smart.

859
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:52,540
You're really smart,
you know that Thomas?

860
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,640
- Thomas!

861
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,110
- You're so smart.
- What?

862
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:56,540
- We all lost her.

863
00:39:58,210 --> 00:39:59,210
All of us.

864
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:03,320
- Yeah, but you know what?

865
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,120
We've got a chance to save her

866
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,220
and he chooses not to.

867
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:09,620
Look at him standing
there staring at me,

868
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,330
looking at me like
I'm the coward.

869
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:16,030
- Stop, stop it!

870
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:17,930
She wouldn't want
you to do this.

871
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:21,040
Stop it, you're
both best friends.

872
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,840
You forget about that?

873
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,770
- Yeah, I've forgotten.

874
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:26,970
You know what else, Jen?

875
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,510
Doesn't really matter what
Lauren would have wanted.

876
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:33,110
She's not here anymore, is she?

877
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,690
- He's gonna be okay.

878
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:44,660
He needs to sober up.

879
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:47,060
- I don't know, I don't know.

880
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:52,100
We're losing him.

881
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,010
- I think we already lost him.

882
00:40:58,010 --> 00:40:59,270
- You know what, babe?

883
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,840
You know what the sad thing is?

884
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,820
I can't even say he's wrong.

885
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,220
- Maybe we can't save the world.

886
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,450
Maybe it's not a possibility.

887
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:14,890
We just have to save
as many as we can.

888
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:18,030
- I already lost my sister.

889
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:21,390
And now this.

890
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:25,630
No, no.

891
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:32,940
- He's the one that
we have to save.

892
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,940
Don't give up on him.

893
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:39,150
He's talking out of love.

894
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,900
- They told me you
were still here.

895
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,100
- Where else would I be?

896
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:02,870
- What is it?

897
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:04,110
What's wrong?

898
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:05,510
Is it the rebels?

899
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,340
- I was thinking about Jack.

900
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:12,580
- Jack?

901
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:13,580
- Yeah.

902
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:16,380
You know it's been
like 20 years now.

903
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:17,850
You realize that?

904
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:20,190
- I know he meant a lot to you

905
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:24,430
and yet you never
talk about him.

906
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:27,090
- I think about him a lot
more often than you realize.

907
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:31,170
- Well you think these men,

908
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:33,030
these ones who
traveled from the past,

909
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:34,370
you think they killed him?

910
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:36,400
- I think,

911
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,110
it makes perfect sense.

912
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:43,750
- I've seen that look
in your eye before.

913
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:46,380
Think before you act.

914
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:49,050
- You know something?

915
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:50,620
The last thing in the
world I need right now

916
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:53,990
is a lecture from you about
how I'm supposed to act

917
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:56,890
or what I'm supposed to
do because I already did

918
00:42:56,890 --> 00:42:59,160
everything I could
the way you wanted.

919
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,730
- What I want?

920
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:02,460
I see you don't want a child.

921
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:04,270
You want us to die out.

922
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:05,970
- I abused my power.

923
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:07,330
I trifled with my power.

924
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:09,240
I did everything I
could in my power

925
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,710
to get what you wanted.

926
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:12,940
- You're right.

927
00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:18,210
I'm just, I'm just trying
to help you do what's best

928
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:19,550
for all of us and part of that

929
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:21,780
is what's best for you and me.

930
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:25,020
- I'm trying.

931
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,250
We did this once before.

932
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:29,260
You almost died.

933
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:32,130
Forgot about that?

934
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:40,740
Listen, I,

935
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:42,040
I want to have a child.

936
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:44,100
Of course I do.

937
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:47,740
I just don't want to lose
you in the process, okay?

938
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:38,090
- Excellent, this'll be the
easiest hunt of my life.
