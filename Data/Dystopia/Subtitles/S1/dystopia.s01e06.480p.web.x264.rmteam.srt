1
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:13,330
Previously on Dystopia.

2
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,470
- The safe box has
an acidic substance.

3
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:16,770
So if it's forced open the vial

4
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,400
will break and all
data will be lost.

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,240
- There's gotta be a
way to crack this open.

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,740
- So where's this place?

7
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:22,910
- There's a community of people

8
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:24,610
that are living outside
of BIOCORP world.

9
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:27,010
- Okay, we'll get
our guy out there.

10
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:28,750
- Activate.

11
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:32,380
- Dead soldiers are free,
prep for the next one.

12
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,120
- We're gonna get that combo.

13
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,190
- Abandon your ID
Chip program research.

14
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,620
- My director of special programs,
he oversees everything.

15
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,590
He will know exactly
what is going on.

16
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,590
- I will ask him...
- What's his name?

17
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:44,490
- Brandon...

18
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:45,900
- Brandon what?

19
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,030
- Davidson.

20
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,170
- You mentioned a list?

21
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:49,400
- We need their addresses.

22
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,700
There's eight of
them that are pivotal

23
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,440
to this BIOCORP project
that we're dealing with.

24
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,240
They're a huge key to
the loss of the virus.

25
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,770
- And what will you do to them?

26
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,240
- Let's give 'em a
chance to change their minds.

27
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,280
- Hey, I'm the
compassionate one, remember?

28
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,510
- Open the cell, take her.

29
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,620
- Lauren, Lauren!

30
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,720
- Did I ever
tell you about my dad?

31
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,620
- No.

32
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,860
- I didn't?
- No.

33
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,330
- He used to make this
pig snorting noises

34
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:18,560
to cheer me up if he
thought I was depressed.

35
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:20,630
Serious, that was
his thing he did.

36
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:21,870
- Make pig noises?

37
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,170
- Mm-hmm, yeah, all the time.

38
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:24,400
- Did it work?

39
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,370
- No, not once ever, but
he did it like it did.

40
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:28,610
You know, it was like his thing.

41
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:29,770
Oh, you're upset,
let me do this.

42
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:31,010
It was terrible.

43
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:33,010
Excuse me, can we
get another one?

44
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:33,980
- Yeah.
- Another one?

45
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:34,810
- Another two.

46
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:36,050
- Another two, okay.

47
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:37,550
- What'd it sound like?

48
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:39,250
- Like it was a proper pig
snorting, like a.

49
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,050
- Like a real?

50
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:43,420
- Like that would make
somebody be happy again.

51
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,720
I used to hate it.

52
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,990
He did it in front
of all my friends.

53
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,690
I'm sure it lost me
like four girlfriends.

54
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,560
- Maybe more than that.

55
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,930
- And I was already the
Brit kid in America.

56
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:53,930
I didn't need another
reason to be bullied.

57
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:57,870
- What happened to him?

58
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:00,840
- He died in the riots.

59
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,550
It was okay, you know,
because he was a hero to me.

60
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,710
He died saving my mum.

61
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,920
You know, died protecting
the woman he loved.

62
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,250
Worse ways to go than that.

63
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,660
But everyday since
that, I was thinking

64
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,790
I hated that pig snorting noise

65
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,830
and I would give anything
to hear it one more time.

66
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:32,100
- Were you there when he died?

67
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,100
- No.

68
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,710
- Why don't you try to find him?

69
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:37,740
We're here.

70
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,940
- What would I say?

71
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,440
We're time-travelers
from the future

72
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,310
trying to save the world.

73
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:45,920
- Well, I wouldn't start the
conversation that way, but...

74
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,180
- Yeah, I know.

75
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,290
- Listen we got time,
you should at least try.

76
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,220
- I did, I found him.

77
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,160
- Where?

78
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,060
- He's sitting at
the end of the bar.

79
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,700
- What are you waiting for?

80
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:07,270
- What would I say to him, Nico?

81
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,240
Would I tell him
he doesn't make it?

82
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,710
Would I tell him my
mum doesn't make it?

83
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,520
Would I tell him none
of us are gonna make it?

84
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:25,420
I'm not gonna do that to him.

85
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,990
I'm not gonna upset him.

86
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,930
Although I did think
of a way to make

87
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,730
his day today just
a little happier.

88
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,030
- What's that?

89
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,600
- I could buy him a beer.

90
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,550
- Excuse me, can I get
one more shot please

91
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:56,690
and a beer for the gentleman
at the end of the bar.

92
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:05,990
- Today Nobel Peace Prize-winning
BIOCORP made history

93
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:08,220
by administering the
cure for cancer available

94
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,890
to the entire world's
population in exchange

95
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,860
for their compulsory enrollment
in the ID chip program

96
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,870
which allows for increased
population security.

97
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:20,240
BIOCORP CEO stated, "We have
all suffered loss in our lives,

98
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,270
"when our loved ones are stolen
from us before their time.

99
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,780
"Today we fight for
the people we love.

100
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,340
"We can't hold on just
a little bit longer."

101
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:30,910
And that's all for tonight.

102
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,220
- And, we're clear.

103
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:41,560
- Hey, baby.

104
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,180
- What's going on?

105
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:09,720
We need to figure this out.

106
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,220
- We're losing them!

107
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,770
- Oh my God, help me!

108
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:30,970
Let me out!

109
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:31,970
Oh, my God!

110
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:47,860
- We are wasting time.

111
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,230
- We are getting close.

112
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:52,400
- Close, that's
your idea of close?

113
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,070
30 attempts, 30 dead volunteers,
that's what you call close?

114
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:58,000
- The variables are too vast.

115
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,470
We need more data.

116
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,940
- Isn't that what we are
paying these scientists for?

117
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:04,010
- Whoever was here locked
us out of the protocols

118
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:06,610
as a fail-safe against
replicating the workflow.

119
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,750
They're a disappointment.

120
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,720
- Well then replace
them, right now!

121
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,250
Replace them, get
these out of here, out.

122
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,750
- Alright, let's go.

123
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:20,620
- I want your best scientists.

124
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,990
- I don't know if anyone else
would be any more successful.

125
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:24,090
- What are you saying?

126
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,560
- Protocols, they're encoded.

127
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,570
- Well then find someone
to break the codes!

128
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,370
- Those women from the
apartment, they would know how.

129
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,840
They maybe even set the code.

130
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,740
- Great, do we know
where they are?

131
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,910
- Our scanners show
that they're with

132
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:42,910
The Unity of Lost
Children terrorist cell.

133
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:44,850
- Oh, that degenerate,
so he adopted

134
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:47,480
two more daughters
into his household.

135
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,290
- Disgusting group.

136
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:51,760
- Get the women and
bring them here.

137
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,220
- And The Lost Children?

138
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,660
- Leave them in the ground,
just get the girls here!

139
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,770
Incompetence.

140
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:46,040
- Yes?

141
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,340
- Brandon Davidson?

142
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,340
- Yes.

143
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,180
- You've bungled
this whole situation

144
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,750
from the very beginning!

145
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,310
Your inability to deal with

146
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:26,750
your people and your
responsibilities.

147
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,550
- Please forgive
me, Mr. President.

148
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,450
- The hell with forgiveness!

149
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:34,120
If you can't do your job then
I'll get somebody who can.

150
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,960
You understand?

151
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,960
- Yes sir, I do.

152
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:39,830
- What about the technology,
can it be replicated?

153
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,970
- Our people are
working on it right now.

154
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:43,470
- If it's replicated
we're gonna need a lot

155
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:46,340
of those little chambers and
we're gonna need 'em fast.

156
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:49,110
- Of course sir, but I'll need
more men and more resources.

157
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,670
- And you'll have 'em.

158
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:54,010
In the meantime, you
send your best man

159
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,110
to hunt down those
bastards, you get it?

160
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:59,750
- Sir, we're still unsuccessful
with proper stasis thus far.

161
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,350
- Then figure it out!

162
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,650
We're running out of time.

163
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,190
- Yes, Mr. President.

164
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,430
- I want somebody to
keep an eye on him.

165
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:11,860
- He's our top man, sir.

166
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,870
- I hope I'm our top man.

167
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,140
Anybody else, I don't trust.

168
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,690
- Shh, shh, don't, don't move!

169
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,730
Hey, stop, stop, stop,
stop it, don't move.

170
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:46,160
- Okay
- Don't move, don't move.

171
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,300
- Please don't hurt me!

172
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,600
- Please don't hurt me!
- Hey, shh!

173
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,170
Keep your voice,
keep your voice down.

174
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:51,370
- Okay, okay.
- Keep your voice down.

175
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:53,170
- Please, I have
credit cards, I have...

176
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:54,700
- Hey stop, I'm not
here to rob you.

177
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,170
- Okay, okay, please.
- I'm not here to rob you.

178
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:57,570
- Please don't.
- I'm not here to rob you.

179
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:58,810
I'm not here to rob you.

180
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:00,740
- I'm a married
woman, please don't.

181
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,610
- Shh, I'm not here
for that, either.

182
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:04,850
- What do you want?

183
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:05,780
What do you want?

184
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,380
- I wanna kill you, Kyla.

185
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,620
- How do you, how
do you know my name?

186
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,060
How do you know my name?

187
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,860
- I know a great deal about
you, about the future.

188
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,690
- What?

189
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:16,530
What?

190
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:17,760
My future?

191
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,430
What are you talking about?

192
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,830
My future?

193
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:24,370
- You don't believe me,
you wouldn't believe.

194
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:25,970
- What's your name?

195
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:29,240
- Thomas is my name.

196
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,680
- Thomas, okay Thomas,
why are you doing this?

197
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,780
- Because I'm saving the world.

198
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,780
I'm saving the future.

199
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,780
- Okay.

200
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:40,980
- Hey!

201
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,220
- Get out.
- Stop it, stop it.

202
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,050
Do you think I'm stupid?

203
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,590
- No, no, no, I don't.

204
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:45,960
- Put your hands on the wheel,
put your hands on the wheel.

205
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,490
- Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

206
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:49,490
Okay, Thomas.

207
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:53,660
Just tell me about
the future, Thomas.

208
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,370
- Don't do that, don't
try and play with me.

209
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:57,630
Don't try and handle me.

210
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,400
- Don't try and talk me down.
- No, I...

211
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,570
- Okay, I'm not
to be toyed with.

212
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:03,110
- I won't and I'm not, I'm not.

213
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,410
- You don't believe me?

214
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:09,310
You don't believe what
I'm gonna say to you.

215
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:12,050
That you and our future
share something in common.

216
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,880
Infertility.

217
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,090
- What?

218
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:17,320
What?

219
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,390
- That's right,
I know about you.

220
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,860
I know all about you.

221
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:23,730
I know that you've been trying
to have a baby for a year.

222
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:24,960
- How?

223
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,130
- Seeing doctor after
doctor after doctor

224
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:28,400
and nothing helped.

225
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,770
I know that you're
seeing a specialist

226
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:33,170
next month and that
won't help either.

227
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,670
- You don't know
that, you bastard!

228
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:36,910
- You don't know that!
- Yes, I do.

229
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,310
Yes, I do.

230
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:39,540
- No, you don't know.
- All that lies ahead for you,

231
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,880
Kyla, is a crushing defeat.

232
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,610
It'll never happen.

233
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:44,980
- Why are you doing this?

234
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,550
- See, that pain
and that anguish

235
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:52,220
that you feel right now, that
hopelessness, that despair?

236
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,390
You multiply that by
six billion people

237
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:59,000
and you have what happens
in our world because of you.

238
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,760
- I'm sorry, but I don't know
what you're talking about.

239
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,530
- I'm sorry too, Kyla!
- Oh, God!

240
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:06,100
- I really am, but
I gotta do this.

241
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,570
- Stop it.
- Please don't!

242
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,540
- Stop!
- Please don't, please don't!

243
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,010
- Please don't kill me!
- Give me one good reason.

244
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:13,840
- Please, please.
- Give me one good reason.

245
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:18,650
- My husband, I'm all
he has left, please!

246
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:20,080
Please, please!

247
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,020
- Why should I care about
you or your husband?

248
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,190
- Don't you have someone
to live for, please?

249
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:30,090
- Better than that, I've got
someone worth killing for.

250
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:34,100
- No, something good,
something to fight for.

251
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:39,070
Something to get back to,
where the pain isn't so much.

252
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,140
- Yeah.

253
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,710
- Please, you're not a monster.

254
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:45,540
- Shut up.

255
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,010
- Please, please.

256
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:49,080
- Please, please.
- Shut up.

257
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,180
Shut up.

258
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,450
- Oh, my!

259
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:57,450
Oh, my God!

260
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:03,230
Oh, my God!

261
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:17,970
- For over half a century

262
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:22,050
BIOCORP has been working to
protect you and your children.

263
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:24,510
At the cutting-edge of
pharmaceutical research,

264
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:27,380
nano-technology, and
disease prevention.

265
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,850
Our goal is to keep you safe.

266
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:32,890
BIOCORP, protecting our future.

267
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,430
For over half a century...

268
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,610
- Tell the generals to start
drawing up contingency plans

269
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,640
for putting an end
to the rebels, okay?

270
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,740
- Eliminating them?

271
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,710
- Yeah, it's time to
put an end to this.

272
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,120
- Yes, Mr. President.

273
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:09,590
- Ming, this is Luke, come in.

274
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:12,700
Ming, this is Luke, come in.

275
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,860
Ming, this is Luke,
you receiving?

276
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,370
- Ming, receiving.

277
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,970
- Anything?

278
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:21,170
- I've reached the town.

279
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:25,870
- What do you see?

280
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,750
- I don't see much,
it looks pretty quiet.

281
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,550
- They can't be that
difficult to find, surely.

282
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:35,550
There's meant to be a
whole community there.

283
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,890
- It doesn't look like
anyone's been here for years.

284
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,330
I'm gonna go check some
more of the houses.

285
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:50,930
- Alright, well
remember, they're hiding.

286
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:52,640
So look everywhere!

287
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,040
- Copy.

288
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,750
- I know what you're thinking.

289
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:14,260
You think we're evil,
sending a guy out there,

290
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:19,030
over the wall, alone, in danger.

291
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,570
But what's at stake here
is bigger than anyone!

292
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:26,570
- Spare me the
justification speech.

293
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:33,610
- I do wonder if there's
anything actually out there

294
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,080
in the dust or
anything to hope for.

295
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,480
Anything.

296
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:50,030
But right now I suspect
that there is nothing

297
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:54,260
and that this whore is
lying to me to buy time.

298
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,930
And that's what this
is all about, time.

299
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,980
- Sir, there's nothing here.

300
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:13,450
What do you want me to do?

301
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:30,200
- Brought you a peace offering.

302
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,640
Have a drink.

303
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:39,940
- No.

304
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:45,310
- I'm just trying to make
this easier on you, you know.

305
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,450
Did anyone ever tell you
how beautiful you are?

306
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,630
I hate this part,

307
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:04,900
but I'm afraid it must be done.

308
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,670
Authority must be
respected at all times.

309
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:11,910
Wouldn't you agree, Lauren?

310
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,150
- I know the combination.

311
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:18,150
- What?

312
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,120
- Jenny knows it, too.

313
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,920
She just didn't wanna tell you.

314
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,920
- Then give it up.

315
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,900
- I'll give it to
you if you let us go.

316
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,100
- Deal.

317
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,100
- It's when Jenny's baby died.

318
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,100
- Which is?

319
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:46,740
- Zero seven, zero
five, three six.

320
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,380
- That's my girl, you
did the right thing.

321
00:18:58,650 --> 00:18:59,650
Three six.

322
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:34,920
Did you just play me?

323
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:39,600
- You weren't gonna let
us go were you, Travis?

324
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,430
I'd rather die than let anything
happen to Thomas or Nico.

325
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:47,500
- There are worse
things than death.

326
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,740
- Let go of me!

327
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,820
- Stay still!

328
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,030
- Get off!

329
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,230
No!

330
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,500
- You leave her alone,
you leave her alone!

331
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,040
- What are you gonna do, huh?

332
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,770
What, you gonna ride in there
on a white horse and save her?

333
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:38,010
- Stop it, you're a monster!

334
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:39,880
- How can you let
him do this to her?

335
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,010
- He is our leader,
he trained us.

336
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:44,880
We would do anything for him!

337
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,320
If he wants to have some
fun who I am to stop him?

338
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,520
- She's not one of you.

339
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:50,950
- Things change.

340
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:55,360
- Okay, okay, go on.

341
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,290
- Do it, you bastard.
- No.

342
00:22:58,290 --> 00:22:59,290
- You coward.

343
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:06,370
- I won't yet, I know you
know the code to that safe.

344
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,910
- Yeah, I do actually.

345
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,240
And I was about
five seconds away

346
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,250
from opening the thing
when you idiots came in.

347
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,850
Should have been a
little more patient, huh?

348
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:22,890
Idiot!

349
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:25,590
Now you're never
gonna get it open.

350
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:40,570
- Level
cleared, moving upstairs.

351
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:00,290
- Take them outta here.

352
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:15,870
How do you feel now, child?

353
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:18,810
- Just do it.

354
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,320
Do it!

355
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:42,260
- Keep your eyes
on the second target.

356
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,730
Careful, we need this one alive.

357
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:45,330
- Two on him, two on him.

358
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,110
- Let's go, get up!

359
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,270
- Room secure.

360
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:05,550
- Is this their
patriarch of the family?

361
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:07,490
- Yes, sir.

362
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:11,860
- Thank you.

363
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:12,900
- Don't thank me yet.

364
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,800
Watch her.

365
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:26,210
You know, I might even get a
promotion after your execution.

366
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,480
- You will never silence
The Lost Children.

367
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:37,190
- You're nothing
but a fear-monger.

368
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:44,490
All your attempts to spread
chaos and terror have failed.

369
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:46,900
- I don't know about that.

370
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:51,170
She seemed terrified of me.

371
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:52,170
- Hold it.

372
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:08,320
My dear, how would you like
to experience true power?

373
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:10,790
- What?

374
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,390
- This is true power.

375
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:21,660
It gives the ultimate
advantage to whoever wields it.

376
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,470
Brave men crumble
in the face of it.

377
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:26,740
- What do you mean?

378
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,340
- Allow me to demonstrate.

379
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,990
- You see how even
Travis gets nervous

380
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:44,190
at the thought of death?

381
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:48,860
I don't think he's quite
ready to die for his cause.

382
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:55,060
Nope, not yet.

383
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,310
- What are you doing?

384
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:13,080
- I'm giving you
control, kill him.

385
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:22,560
Kill the bastard that raped you.

386
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,500
- I can't.

387
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:34,470
- Sure you can, his
death is warranted.

388
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:36,710
Think of all the
crimes he's committed,

389
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:40,510
all the atrocities his
so-called Children relish in.

390
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:45,010
- She doesn't have the guts.

391
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,350
- That's it.

392
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:59,230
- She's not gonna do it.

393
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:01,300
She's not gonna sully
her hands on me.

394
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:04,130
- See how he mocks you?

395
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,870
Are you gonna give
him the satisfaction?

396
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:13,780
Are you gonna let him win?

397
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,080
- Do it!

398
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,980
- There, you even
have his permission.

399
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:27,420
Either you kill him quickly
or my men will do it slowly.

400
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:43,810
- I can't.

401
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,540
- I knew you couldn't do it.

402
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:53,080
You're nothing but a stupid...

403
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:09,970
You're welcome.

404
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:31,920
This will all be over soon.

405
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,320
- The human race?

406
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,190
- Always so dramatic.

407
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:40,730
You spend so much
time fighting us

408
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:42,800
you fail to see the
reality of the situation,

409
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,400
that the Speaker's
intentions are good.

410
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,400
- Good?

411
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,170
How do you figure that exactly?

412
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:54,040
- He rescued you from the
terrorist cell, didn't he?

413
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,940
- Out of the frying
pan into the fire.

414
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:58,210
- It's an appropriate metaphor.

415
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:05,090
- Why do you follow him blindly?

416
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:08,020
- I owe him my life.

417
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:10,260
- Does that make
you the only one?

418
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,360
- You don't understand,
what he did for me

419
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:15,700
I would proudly serve
him 'til the day I die.

420
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:19,730
- Are we gonna be okay?

421
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,300
- We will, I promise.

422
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:26,410
- I wouldn't make any
promises you can't keep.

423
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,510
- Sir, we're
clearing the terrorist base.

424
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:33,820
Just awaiting your
permission to set the bomb.

425
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,720
Leave no survivors.

426
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:39,020
- Roger that.

427
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:11,650
- Hey, how's the mission going?

428
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:14,860
- A lot tougher than I expected.

429
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:18,730
- Tough for anybody.

430
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:21,230
- I really tried
to be reasonable with him.

431
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:22,760
- What happened?

432
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,470
- I killed Brandon Davidson
in front of his kids today.

433
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,910
- We're almost there, mate.

434
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:38,910
- Yeah, almost, but not quite.

435
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:41,050
I just wonder...

436
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:42,350
- What about?

437
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:44,090
- Sometimes I just
wonder that...

438
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:46,090
- What?

439
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:47,890
I wonder if the people
that we're approaching,

440
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:50,260
if they know what
they're doing is bad

441
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,730
if it's gonna end up
bad in the future.

442
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:53,730
- No mate, they don't know.

443
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:54,900
What makes you say that?

444
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:58,400
- Because the guy that
I got the chip from today,

445
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,100
he made a duplicate,
he kept in a safe.

446
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,870
He protected it like he knew
what it was capable of doing.

447
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,240
- Damn.

448
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,450
Where's the chip now?

449
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:11,450
- I got it.

450
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,380
- Destroy it.

451
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,180
- It's done.

452
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,720
Are we doing the
right thing, Thomas?

453
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,730
- We're saving the world, Nico.

454
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:25,930
- Yeah, I guess in a way we are.

455
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:30,630
I just don't know how much
longer I can keep this up.

456
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:31,900
- You can do this, mate.

457
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:35,040
- You're right, I can, I can.

458
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:39,340
- There's the Nico
we all know and love.

459
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,840
Are you getting any sleep?

460
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:47,680
- Barely man, if I
do it's nightmares.

461
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,920
- Yeah, yeah, I've been
having a few of those.

462
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:54,160
- About what?

463
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:57,660
- My nightmare, Nico,
it's us failing,

464
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,960
not being able to get home.

465
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:35,100
- All that work and we're
just gonna sit here?

466
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:42,400
Who the hell do you...

467
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:03,660
- Alright, my apologies, I
had to finish the chapter.

468
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:04,790
It's my favorite book.

469
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,900
Well done, Commander.

470
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:09,900
- Thank you, sir.

471
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:15,370
- So, isn't this
a nice surprise?

472
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,040
I trust your journey
was comfortable?

473
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:21,010
- What do you want?

474
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:27,010
- And I take it you're not
one for pleasantries, then.

475
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,650
Alright, then I'll
get right to it.

476
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,990
BIOCORP has grown
in profits and power

477
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:42,700
far more than even I
ever could have imagined.

478
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:48,740
But if I could go back and
do it over again, of course

479
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,910
there are improvements
that I would make.

480
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:53,610
- It's all about the profits.

481
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:55,880
- Commander, Commander, please.

482
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:59,480
We know my distaste for
unnecessary violence.

483
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:03,650
I mean, what would
the children think?

484
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:07,620
So, today is your lucky day.

485
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,160
You're just in time
to see another one

486
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:15,600
of our attempts at
using those machines.

487
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:19,230
The past results
have been disastrous.

488
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,210
Normally, we would use
one of our soldiers,

489
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:27,210
but to celebrate
your arrival today,

490
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,410
we're going to use
one of your friends

491
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:33,620
from The Unity of Lost Children.

492
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,780
- What?

493
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,520
No!

494
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:40,690
Get off of me!

495
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,920
Stop!

496
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,230
- Finally got your attention.

497
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,800
Prep him, now!

498
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:03,210
- So how did it go with
BIOCORP's head of security?

499
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:04,150
Did you talk to him?

500
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:06,250
- I tried, but he...

501
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,220
He didn't listen.

502
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:16,690
Don't forget why we're
doing what we're doing.

503
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:18,930
- Yeah, for the children.

504
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:22,400
- Yeah, for the children.

505
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,400
- How many more are there?

506
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:31,070
- I'm half-way.

507
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:33,110
- Me, too.

508
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,680
- I guess you'd better
get back to work.

509
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,610
- Hello.

510
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:06,640
- Hi.

511
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,880
- Hi, how are you?

512
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,410
- Hi.

513
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:10,680
- Honey, what did I tell you
about talking to strangers?

514
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,110
I'm so sorry.

515
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,450
- No, it's not a problem.

516
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:14,380
- What's your name?

517
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:16,850
- You don't ask strangers that!

518
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:18,990
- No, I told you, it's
not a problem, really.

519
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:21,390
My name is Nicholai.

520
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:22,220
What's your name?

521
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:23,220
- Jenny.

522
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,530
- That's a beautiful name.

523
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:27,730
- Thank you.

524
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:29,100
- Say goodbye to the nice man.

525
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,230
- Bye.

526
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:32,230
- Bye.

527
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,240
- You have to be careful
to who you talk to Jenny.

528
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,810
- I'll see you again.

529
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:47,320
- So, as I understand it,

530
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:50,650
the computer systems
hold the data

531
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:54,120
for the proper
teleportation protocols

532
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:58,460
but, they seem to be encoded.

533
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:01,290
Well...

534
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:07,700
I need those protocols.

535
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,140
I'll ask you again.

536
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,380
I need those protocols.

537
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,260
Nothing?

538
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:39,230
No one?

539
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:45,670
Well, then.

540
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,150
- No, Lauren!

541
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:01,690
- I'll ask you again.

542
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,030
- Wait.

543
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:05,960
- I want the protocols.

544
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,360
I want them now.

545
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,300
- Wait, wait.

546
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,300
- Don't say anything.

547
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,770
- I have no problem
killing either one of you.

548
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,240
Tell me.

549
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:28,020
Your friend, soldier,
bring him out here.

550
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:31,050
Bring him out, come
on, to the right!

551
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:40,090
I want the protocols, now!

552
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,700
Do you think you're
safe with someone?

553
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:50,200
We will get this working
eventually with or without you

554
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,270
and when we do I will
see that it will be used

555
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:57,750
to hunt down and kill every
member of your families.

556
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:01,220
You will all be wiped clean
from the history of this planet!

557
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:03,120
Now give me the protocols!

558
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,690
- Go ahead, do it!
- No, no!

559
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:05,920
- No, no, no let him.

560
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,420
Let him show us just how
powerful a man he is.

561
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:09,420
- Alright.

562
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:14,230
Do you really wanna
see another woman die?

563
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:17,930
- Please, please, I'll
show you how it works.

564
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:19,100
- Good boy.

565
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,670
- No, what they're
doing is more important.

566
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:22,440
- I can't live with this.

567
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,540
- What, what?

568
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:26,240
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

569
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,440
- You made a very
astute decision.

570
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:33,350
But do you think I
really trust you?

571
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:34,350
- What?

572
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:39,590
- Soldier, get him out of here.

573
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:43,360
It's your lucky day, young man.

574
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:48,360
We're going to send her.

575
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,460
- No, no, I'll send her.

576
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:52,570
- Really?

577
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:54,040
- Everyone you've sent is dead!

578
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,140
You don't know what
you're doing, but I do.

579
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:04,380
To show you how it works, to
show you we can be trusted.

580
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:10,180
I'll send her and then
afterwards we go free.

581
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,620
- Fine.
- What are you doing?

582
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,120
- I'm saving our lives.
- No, I'm not his guinea pig!

583
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,590
- I don't have time for
these domestic squabbles!

584
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:17,630
If you don't get going
I will put a bullet

585
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:20,600
in each of your heads in 10
seconds and I swear to it.

586
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,700
- Let me test the
machine to make sure

587
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:22,900
your men haven't damaged it.

588
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,400
- Of course, my men
have damaged it.

589
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,430
If I was certain that it was
working you'd be dead by now!

590
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:29,070
Now you're wasting
my time, go, go!

591
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:32,710
Commander.

592
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,480
- No, David, David, no!

593
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:38,780
- Stand down from that post.

594
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:39,680
- Let go of me!

595
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,510
David!

596
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:41,350
Let go of me!

597
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:42,780
David!

598
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:43,920
- Oh, shut up!

599
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,020
- David!

600
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:57,330
- System unlocked,
welcome back, David.

601
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:09,040
Time displacement
protocols loaded.

602
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,540
- Well?

603
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:12,710
- I can't tell until I've
run a full diagnostics.

604
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:14,450
- And how long will that take?

605
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:15,550
- A day, maybe two.

606
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:16,520
- Are you kidding me?

607
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,790
That's totally unacceptable!

608
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:19,450
- Listen to me, this isn't just

609
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:21,290
an issue of killing
person after person.

610
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:22,760
The only way to
know if the machine

611
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,130
is working properly or not,
which is what you want,

612
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:28,360
is for me to test
the mechanism first.

613
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,630
- No.

614
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,730
- Then I'll send Jenny
through when I'm sure.

615
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:35,100
- He does have a point, sir.

616
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,340
- Do you really think I hate you

617
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:39,210
so much I'd kill
the woman I love?

618
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:43,340
I'd do anything for her,
anything to save her.

619
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:46,950
- That's reasonable.

620
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,280
I'd say it's even admirable.

621
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:53,890
Commander, how do we know that

622
00:42:53,890 --> 00:42:56,120
the machine won't
work right now?

623
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:01,760
Have her strapped
in the machine.

624
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,600
- Wait, what?

625
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,530
- Yes, sir.

626
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:04,470
- No, let go of me!

627
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:05,630
- We'll send her.

628
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:07,130
- Let go of me!

629
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:09,000
- And if she dies
I'll do whatever you ask.

630
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,470
- Get off of me!

631
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:11,710
- You can take all the time
you want with your diagnostics.

632
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:13,880
You, scientists!

633
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,380
Listen, watch.

634
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:16,640
I want to get rid of these
people as soon as possible.

635
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:20,010
- Wait, wait, wait, just let me!

636
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:23,650
- Really, I thought it
would take a day or two?

637
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:28,220
One or two days.

638
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:45,040
- What's that?

639
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,240
- It's an anesthetic.

640
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,540
- Go confirm what's
in that syringe.

641
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:50,910
- It's the only way it works.

642
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:52,810
They have to be
asleep on either end

643
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:54,580
before they go
through or they die.

644
00:43:56,350 --> 00:43:59,490
- You idiots couldn't
figure that out on your own?

645
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:01,060
- System ready, David.

646
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:04,860
- Track the microchip.

647
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,000
- I hope we have
success with this one.

648
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
- We might.

649
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,070
What are you saying to her?

650
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:15,570
- I'm just trying
to help her relax.

651
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:18,270
She has to be in a coma-like
state before she goes through.

652
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,780
You only have an
hour to put yourself

653
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:25,910
to sleep before
you come back in.

654
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:26,850
- Okay.

655
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:28,010
- Don't waste time exploring.

656
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:30,450
Find Nico and come home.

657
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,760
- David.

658
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:35,920
I didn't know.

659
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:38,760
- See you soon.
