1
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,670
- In the year
2037 our world is dying.

2
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:24,970
Mankind has been struck by
an infertility pandemic.

3
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,350
Those who suffer childbirth
are rewarded with

4
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:31,580
a mere 15 seconds of
their baby's life.

5
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,120
Before the virus takes them.

6
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,920
Anyone that does this once,

7
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,520
never attempts it again.

8
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,060
The pain is just too much.

9
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:41,120
- Today, Biocorp made
made world history

10
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,220
by administering
the cure for cancer.

11
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:45,890
Available to the entire
world's population,

12
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,890
in exchange for their
voluntary enrollment

13
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:49,460
in the ID chip program.

14
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:57,100
- Not a single child
exists in our world today.

15
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,470
Empty schools and empty playgrounds
haunt our waking dreams.

16
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,110
People rioted.

17
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:05,780
Killed each other in the
hopeless void that faced us.

18
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,910
Biocorp was allowed
to declare martial law

19
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,410
to keep the peace.

20
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,380
Which only meant they
employed hired thugs

21
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,750
to put down anyone
that blamed them

22
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,450
for their futile existence.

23
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,930
An uprising killed 15
million people in 2023.

24
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,960
There hasn't been
a rebellion since.

25
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,600
And what would be the point?

26
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,000
Biocorp doesn't have to care.

27
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,940
No one does.

28
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,340
But it was our fault, really.

29
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,580
Biocorp tempted every human

30
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,710
into accepting the
ID chip program.

31
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,450
A microchip that would cure
every disease known to man.

32
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,150
The promise was immortality.

33
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,620
It almost lived
up to its promise.

34
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,520
We're healthy.

35
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,360
There's no disease in our time.

36
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,830
But there's also no children.

37
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,500
As the chip couldn't
tell the difference

38
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,430
between disease and a pregnancy.

39
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,640
It was tough to put
a brave face on it.

40
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:09,670
But we had to.

41
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,510
For those we loved.

42
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,510
- Hey, sis.

43
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,150
- Hey, baby.

44
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,690
- Hey, baby.

45
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:22,590
I found a new place today.

46
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,520
- Oh yeah, how was it?

47
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,520
- Oh, it was great.

48
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:26,990
- That's good.

49
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:28,120
- Surprises.

50
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,390
- Surprises?
- Mmm hmm.

51
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,230
- Okay.

52
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,100
- Yup, I did.

53
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,430
Look at this.

54
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,670
- What is that?

55
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,040
What are you trying to
sweeten me up for?

56
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,740
- No, it's not, I
love that smile.

57
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,980
- There's no food is there?

58
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,780
- No, but there's copper wire.

59
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,980
- Oh, copper wire.
- Mm hmm.

60
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,150
- I'm sure that will
taste very delicious.

61
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:59,590
- Indeed it will, once you put
that secret sauce of yours.

62
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,690
- Oh, a secret sauce of mine.

63
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,460
Hey babe, the secret?

64
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,460
It's out.

65
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,570
- We are on the
verge of finding you.

66
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:13,300
Believe me our
species will prevail.

67
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,200
You need not worry about that.

68
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,410
- We've heard this before!

69
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,410
Biocorp needs to give
us a solution now!

70
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:20,480
You made the problem
you should clean it up!

71
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,880
- Sir, we have the best
scientists on this planet.

72
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,420
And we are aware of everything
you are saying, sir.

73
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,820
As I was saying.

74
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,530
Biocorp is protecting
your future.

75
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:38,500
- Are you trying to
get us both killed?

76
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,930
- They are lying
to us every month!

77
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:41,330
They're hiding
something in there!

78
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,600
- Of course they are!

79
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,600
- Okay.

80
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,340
- Vanish.

81
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:58,850
Do you know,

82
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,920
it's people like you.

83
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,090
Scientists.

84
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,720
That ruin our world.

85
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,160
Meddling into things you couldn't
possibly ever understand.

86
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,990
- I understand.

87
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:11,990
- No you don't.

88
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:16,800
Our species is dying, that
much you might understand.

89
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,540
What you don't understand
is that our only hope,

90
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,940
lies with the Biocorp
scientists finding a cure

91
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,210
for this pandemic.

92
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,780
And in order for them
to do that, we need to

93
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,550
give them everything they need.

94
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,010
Including cooperation.

95
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:33,920
Cooperation so they can do their
job as quickly as possible.

96
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:35,950
- Is that a joke?

97
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:37,850
Biocorp.

98
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,220
Do you believe
half of the rubbish

99
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,230
you spout from that
podium every month?

100
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:46,600
Biocorp isn't doing anything.

101
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,570
Biocorp doesn't have a cure.

102
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:49,830
That's the truth.

103
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:52,070
Biocorp isn't even
working on a cure.

104
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,640
That's the truth!

105
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,140
You know why?

106
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,740
Because if they were, you'd
be flanked by scientists.

107
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,010
And not guys with guns.

108
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,340
- Wanna cause a panic?

109
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,780
Hmm?

110
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,150
Want the riots again of 2023,
is that what you'd like?

111
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,920
- I want the truth.

112
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,950
- Oh, you want the truth.

113
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,120
Well,

114
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:17,330
I'm gonna tell you the truth.

115
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,000
And after I tell you the truth,

116
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,530
that man is going to kill you.

117
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,970
So here's the truth.

118
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,810
We've got nothing.

119
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:37,010
If you'll excuse me, I
have to meet with our CEO.

120
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,920
Make it discreet.

121
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:46,560
- Perhaps I've got
time for a cigarette.

122
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,560
What do you say?

123
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,500
Thank you.

124
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:58,600
I know it's not easy.

125
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,900
Just following orders, huh?

126
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,780
You old enough to remember
a time when everyone

127
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,810
was worried about these
things killin' us?

128
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,780
And Biocorp broke in and saved
the world by curing cancer.

129
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,250
Something kinda
funny about that.

130
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:17,350
Cure every disease.

131
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,090
Including that
horrible one pregnancy.

132
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,470
I haven't got a lighter.

133
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,730
- Alright, ready?

134
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:03,730
Ready to fly?

135
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,170
- Is everything okay?

136
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:11,170
- Hey.
- Hi.

137
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,410
- I was skipping curfew.

138
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:17,450
- Yeah, well maybe
you need a new watch.

139
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:19,080
Because you've got 30 minutes.

140
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:23,490
- Right, yeah.

141
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:27,460
Well maybe I was
rushing home to see you.

142
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,030
- Sister.

143
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,530
Brother's in the room, you know.

144
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:36,500
- Maybe you should tell me
your brother's still here.

145
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,800
Any joy?

146
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,400
- Uh, if by any joy you mean

147
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,670
putting him into a coma, yes.

148
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:43,510
By teleporting him 10 feet now.

149
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,210
- We gotta stop killing mice.

150
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,380
I don't feel good about it.

151
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,350
- Yeah, me too.

152
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,280
- Okay.

153
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,780
Tell me about the signal, c'mon.

154
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:54,320
- Well, it's the same 23
hour 56 minute repetition.

155
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,750
- Okay.

156
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,720
- But there's no way to
track where it's coming from.

157
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,190
- What about the
triangulation by the numbers,

158
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,090
I thought it was something.

159
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,030
- That's just it.

160
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,190
There is a source reading.

161
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:04,460
If you look right here,

162
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,700
- What did it say?

163
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,760
- Well, it says it's
coming from here.

164
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,830
- Here the apartment?

165
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,000
- Thing has a bug in it.

166
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,440
- We have to
recalibrate it again.

167
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,670
- Yeah.

168
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,870
- Guys, come on
it's getting cold.

169
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,110
- We'll get there with it, mate.

170
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,680
- What did you say?

171
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,140
- We'll get there with it, mate.

172
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,180
- Okay, dude, we'll get
there with it mate.

173
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,210
- Don't take the mick outta me.

174
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:26,420
Damn, mate, just the love tags.

175
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,780
- Hey, easy man.

176
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,490
- It's my turn, it's my turn.

177
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:30,420
- My turn!

178
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,320
- See what I grew up with?

179
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,790
- Shut up, okay.

180
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:35,860
Pretend like I never heard
anything you guys said before,

181
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:40,500
and tell me again, how exactly
is this gonna make us rich?

182
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,900
- Hey, what he's
trying to say is,

183
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,140
that teleportation is possible,

184
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,470
and we actually
have the prototype

185
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,010
- to show to the government.
- A prototype?

186
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:50,170
- Yes we have the prototype.
- You call that a prototype?

187
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:51,640
- Okay.
- Yes.

188
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,140
- We'll just stay with
the governor's committee,

189
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,010
and we need more funding so
we can get to the next level.

190
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:56,810
- Ah, that doesn't work.

191
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:58,720
- Excuse me, it works.
- It does?

192
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,220
- Yes.
- It was sort of...

193
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,350
- No, phase one of it was.

194
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:05,220
- Oh, how many phases
- There's like,

195
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,090
two or three phases.

196
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:06,920
But phase one?

197
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,760
Human mapping.

198
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,260
Encoding.

199
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,190
We can do all of that, we
just can't send it anywhere

200
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:14,060
cuz it's too big
- Ohhh so you can't really

201
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,830
- teleport anyone.
- It's a little bit...

202
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:18,130
- Sounds like a little flaw.
- It's not a flaw.

203
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:19,370
- Just a little bit.
- Actually no, no.

204
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,300
The mapping process
is really impressive.

205
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,040
And the recoding thing
that we figured out

206
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,240
is really cool
- Oh the recoding.

207
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,280
- Oh there he goes
abusing the word cool!

208
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,780
Don't abuse the word cool.

209
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,050
- Once we get the, you know what

210
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,510
once we get the copper
wire around the coils,

211
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,920
all we're going to have to
look at is signal degradation.

212
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,750
- Signal degradation,
that's another magical.

213
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,980
- No, that's something else.

214
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,980
Shut up, sis.

215
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,650
- The signal, mate, you
wanna hear about that?

216
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:40,320
- I definitely wanna
hear about that.

217
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,290
- Go ahead tell me.
- If you're not worthy

218
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:43,060
of this story, just say, okay?

219
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:43,890
- Tell it.

220
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,160
- Go ahead, sis.

221
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,060
- Every day for the last
year, every 23 hours,

222
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:50,800
56 minutes, we get a signal
that lasts six seconds.

223
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,270
- What does it say?

224
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:54,100
- Well, it's more like a beacon.

225
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,010
- Oh, a beacon.
- No, but...

226
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:58,610
- I was thinking,
- So who's sending it?

227
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:00,840
- Where is it coming from?
- We're beaconing you.

228
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,480
- Yes, but it's on
the top of our list,

229
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,980
we're figuring it out.

230
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:04,980
- Oh, I have a few things
for the top of the list.

231
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,520
- Okay, okay, you know what?

232
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,750
You know what?

233
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,250
Why don't you guys just
let us know sometime.

234
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,690
- You know if you
guys wanna chip in...

235
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,900
- Hey.

236
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:26,740
- Hey.

237
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,240
- You on lookout duty?

238
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,540
- No, just came up
for a breath of fresh air.

239
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,080
- Ah.

240
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,310
You okay?

241
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,410
You seem a little off.

242
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:37,910
- I haven't come up
to the roof everyday

243
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,020
to think about things.

244
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,520
- What were you thinking about?

245
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,820
- I was thinking,
it is going to rain.

246
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,890
- You know that's really
a British stereotype,

247
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,160
talking about the weather?

248
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,160
- Okay, am I living
up to that right now?

249
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,560
- You are living up to it.

250
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,500
- Right.
- Uh huh.

251
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,330
- Well, I don't know if
you'd be really interested

252
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:55,900
in what I was really
thinking about anyway.

253
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,500
- Yeah the fact that you were
thinking is what's impressive.

254
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,000
But go on.

255
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,140
- Okay, well you'll like this
one slightly better then.

256
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,210
- Okay, okay.

257
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:05,010
- I was thinking about you.

258
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,080
- You were thinking about me?

259
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,550
That's nice.

260
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:27,560
- Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

261
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,200
- Hey, you okay?

262
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,270
- I don't want you to, uh,

263
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,210
pin all your hopes on me.

264
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:38,210
Not me.

265
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,680
And you know what I am for you?

266
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,150
I'm a lack of options.

267
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:45,210
I'm a distinct lack of options.

268
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:46,950
- Why don't you
stop talking, okay?

269
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,820
Look, I don't know what's
going on with you, but,

270
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,920
don't try and push me
away with this crap

271
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,390
and not tell me what's
really going on, okay?

272
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:56,390
So what's going on?

273
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:02,270
- We can't, we can't.

274
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,270
- You can't.

275
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,970
- I feel like
something's coming.

276
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,880
And I might not always
able to be here.

277
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:16,510
- Okay.

278
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,920
- Where would we go?

279
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,580
- Where would we go,
there's nowhere to go.

280
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,920
There's nothing
beyond the city walls.

281
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,920
Not anymore.

282
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:27,090
Here is all we got.

283
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:30,630
- Is here that bad?

284
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,730
- No here's, pretty
wonderful sometimes.

285
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,970
But you know here is
also owned by Biocorp.

286
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:44,670
Biocorp, who can turn
up whenever they want,

287
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:47,440
take whatever they want simply
because it pleases them.

288
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:51,050
And that's a
precarious place to be.

289
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,680
- We're safe here.

290
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,020
Together.

291
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,960
- Yeah.

292
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,930
Did you feel that?

293
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,160
That was a raindrop.

294
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,360
- Why are you changing
- That's a raindrop!

295
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,830
- The subject?
- I'm not changing

296
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,030
- I get with the rain.
- I'm standing up here to

297
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,270
- You are gonna,
- That's a raindrop.

298
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,200
- I'm gonna kill you
one of these days.

299
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,570
- It is gonna fully rain.

300
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:15,000
- I've got powers or something.
- I can't even have

301
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,770
a serious conversation
with you, I swear!

302
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,680
You're gonna kill me
one of these days.

303
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,580
Oh boy.

304
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:25,680
- Our efforts to find a
cure for a disease that has

305
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,120
plagued our generation,
will take longer

306
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,790
than we first predicted.

307
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,090
We've all suffered greatly.

308
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:36,390
And without ever being
able to bring to justice

309
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:39,060
whatever disease put
us in this position.

310
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,400
The global biological clock

311
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,770
- Is ticking against us.

312
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:45,770
At this time,

313
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,700
- during our darkest hour

314
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,810
- During our darkest hour,
as we go through hell,

315
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:54,180
- As we go through hell,
the only thing we can do,

316
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,780
- The only thing we
can do, is keep going.

317
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,150
- Is keep going.

318
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,750
- That's pretty good.

319
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,860
We can go ahead
and release that.

320
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,400
- It is, with a heavy heart,

321
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,600
that I address you today.

322
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:19,340
Our efforts to find a cure

323
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,770
for a disease that has
plagued our generation,

324
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:24,710
will take longer than
we first predicted.

325
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:29,610
Block 14, report to Sector Nine.

326
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,140
- Can't sleep?

327
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:37,310
- Uh,

328
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:39,850
no.

329
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,220
I was just gonna, um...

330
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,320
You?

331
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,720
- Bad dream.

332
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,390
- The one with the kid, right?

333
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:55,530
- Yeah, nightmares of the
mind are the craziest thing.

334
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,040
Make you believe
things about people

335
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,040
that um,

336
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,080
you never thought
they'd ever do.

337
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:10,410
- Yeah.

338
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,680
- Hmm.

339
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,020
What's up buddy?

340
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,320
- You know I should, uh,

341
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,660
I think it'd be best if I...

342
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,360
Look, I uh,

343
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:27,700
I killed a Biocorp guard today.

344
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,530
- What?

345
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:29,470
- Had no choice, really.

346
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:30,900
It was like a self defense,

347
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,170
the speaker, he was lying
in the forum, right?

348
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:34,640
So I called him
out on it, but I,

349
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,610
I didn't know what else to do.

350
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:38,770
- Where's the body?

351
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:40,480
The body, where's the body?

352
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,850
- I had to leave him, uh,

353
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:44,010
It's in an alleyway.

354
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:44,980
- No you're not,
they're gonna find it.

355
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,150
- No, it's under debris.

356
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,650
It's like on a
- Oh my God.

357
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:48,920
- Nick, what was
I supposed to do?

358
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,120
What was I supposed
to rollover and die?

359
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,020
- What were you supposed to do?

360
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,720
Thomas what you're supposed
to do is not come here,

361
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,290
after you kill a Biocorp guard!

362
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,790
You know you put my sister
and my wife in harms way?

363
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,060
- I didn't...

364
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,160
- They're gonna find
you, you gotta chip.

365
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,400
An ID chip.

366
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,530
- They won't track me,
here we're in concrete.

367
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:04,470
I'll be, it'll be muffled.

368
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:05,800
That's why I went here.

369
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,070
- Oh so you're so
sure about that, huh?

370
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,270
- I'm not sure
- You're not sure about much.

371
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,870
- Sure hey, but,

372
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,340
look it happened so fast.

373
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,440
I was gonna, hey what are
you doing what are you doing?

374
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,240
- Whoa whoa whoa whoa!
- I'm going

375
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,040
to clean up your mess.

376
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,880
Where's the body?

377
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,810
- Please, let me go.

378
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:16,610
I was gonna go, let me go.

379
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:17,610
- Where is the body?

380
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:20,720
- If I go, the
problem goes with me.

381
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,720
Please.

382
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:23,950
I can't let you go, you can't

383
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:25,720
go back to the scene of the
crime for Christ's sake,

384
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,920
they'll see you
comin' it's curfew!

385
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,630
- Yes but if we
don't find the body,

386
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:34,630
they're gonna find you in less
than 24 hours with your chip.

387
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,470
Thomas, where's the body?

388
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Thomas!

389
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:43,040
- What, what, no wait,
what did you say?

390
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,270
- I said where's the body.

391
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,570
- No no did you say, you
said they'd find me in

392
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:46,640
- Less than 24 hours

393
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,780
- So what.
- A day, a day, right?

394
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:48,610
24 hours a day.

395
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:49,550
- Yeah, so what?

396
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,080
- What's less than 24 hours?

397
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,520
- What are you talking about?

398
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,180
- 23 hours, 56 minutes.

399
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,020
- Yeah.

400
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,550
- 23 hours 56 minutes.

401
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,590
That signal, that comes in
every 23 hours 56 minutes.

402
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,520
- Right, so what?
- You know what else it is?

403
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,790
The exact length of a
rotation of the Earth.

404
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:04,330
A day.

405
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:06,460
We just round it up to, to
24 hours for convenience.

406
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,400
- Right?
- Right, I know that.

407
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,900
But what difference does it make

408
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,400
when there's a body out there
that needs to be dealt with?

409
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,870
Otherwise they're gonna
ship us to the outer lands!

410
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:13,040
- Stop thinking about distance.

411
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,300
Stop thinking
about where we are.

412
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,770
It's about when.

413
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:17,570
The signal.

414
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:19,170
When is the signal?

415
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:21,280
Not where is it coming from,
when is it coming from?

416
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,350
- When?
- It's a day.

417
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,380
Someone wants us to
- When?

418
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,080
- pay attention to time.

419
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:25,980
- When?

420
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,780
- Think about it.

421
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,180
The teleportation
system, we start

422
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,790
working on that a year ago.

423
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,120
Then we start
gettin' this signal.

424
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,260
At the exact same time.

425
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,660
Right?

426
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,430
We're so obsessed with
trying to change one variable

427
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:38,730
we can't seem to control.

428
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,160
Distance.

429
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,360
But we're forgetting
about the other variable.

430
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,100
What if we hold distance
firm and we change

431
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,700
the only other variable we can?

432
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,170
- The other variable being time.

433
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,310
- Time.

434
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,410
- But how do we...

435
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:54,680
- How do we?

436
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,080
How'd you did?

437
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,250
The signal,

438
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,680
the beacon it's our beacon.

439
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,450
It's from right here,
right in this room!

440
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,880
It's just not from right now.

441
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,390
- Alright, look.

442
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:11,230
The frequency of the
signal shifts by a decibel

443
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:12,660
and then it just resets.

444
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,160
- Okay, but it
shifts and resets.

445
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,800
So look for a pattern.

446
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,800
- I got it.

447
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,740
It's repeating binary code.

448
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,110
- Let's see it.

449
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,110
Let's see it!

450
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,440
What do you got,
what do you got?

451
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,980
- Uh, it's a
sequence of numbers.

452
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:30,480
Uh, 1-2-2-0-2-0-1-7.

453
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,750
What does it mean,
what does it mean?

454
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:37,350
- Um, I, location
coordinates for something.

455
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,050
- No no no that's not enough
for longitude latitude.

456
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:42,190
Uh, it's, ah...

457
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,990
Thomas!

458
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:45,090
We're idiots!

459
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:46,600
Look it's not, look!

460
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,800
It's time.

461
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,830
It's a date.

462
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,530
December 20th, 2017.

463
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:55,440
- My god, that's before Biocorp.

464
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,740
- Exactly!

465
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:57,470
- Before the virus
became a pandemic.

466
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:58,470
- I know.

467
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:59,980
We can go back.

468
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,440
We're almost there.

469
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,610
We can go back and fix all
this before it ever happened.

470
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:04,650
- Go back?

471
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:08,850
We can't send Henry 10 feet
without inducing a coma.

472
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,120
- Maybe we didn't.

473
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,290
Check this out, buddy.

474
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:13,390
Look, come here.

475
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,260
Alright, look.

476
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,990
As long as Henry was in
stasis, his brain activity was

477
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,760
consistent to rodent
that was awake.

478
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,900
It was all because he was awake.

479
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,570
He was alive somewhere
moving around!

480
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:25,200
- Niko, that's a big assumption.

481
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,640
We don't know if that's
true and even if it is,

482
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,740
it's a one way trip!

483
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,410
We never brought anybody back!

484
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:33,940
- But if this is right, we're
talking about time travel.

485
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:36,580
I mean we could fix all this
before it ever happened.

486
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,550
Jesus, Thomas.

487
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,120
We're talking about the
extinction of Mankind!

488
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:45,550
Don't pretend we have
to think about this.

489
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,520
- Okay, okay you're right.

490
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,790
You're right, okay?

491
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:50,390
So who gets to go?

492
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:52,700
- Look, I'll go because
if something happens to me

493
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,160
I need you to take
care of the girls.

494
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,200
- Great, you're going to
leave me explaining this crap?

495
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,600
- Yeah.
- Oh.

496
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,800
I'll go, because I'm the
guy who killed somebody.

497
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,570
- I'm the wanted man.
- No because this was my idea.

498
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:02,000
- You don't need this sore.
- You know the guy I am.

499
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,940
I'm always trying to
take responsibility.

500
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,210
- You don't need to suffer!

501
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:05,440
- So let me handle
the consequences.

502
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,380
Isn't that what
you want me to do?

503
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,640
- We're gonna flip for it.

504
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,840
- We're not gonna flip for it.
- Yes we are.

505
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,780
- We're gonna flip for it.
- No, I'm gonna go.

506
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,710
- No, this is gonna happen.

507
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:11,950
Otherwise I'm kicking your ass.

508
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,450
- Fine, flip.

509
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,280
- Heads.

510
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:17,750
- Best of three.

511
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,190
- Shut up and help
me get this going.

512
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,060
- His name is Thomas.

513
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,630
He's an enemy of the state.

514
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:27,460
He murdered a Biocorp employee.

515
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,100
This is your new target.

516
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:34,070
We need swift justice.

517
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,370
Set an example.

518
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:37,140
To everybody in Sector Nine.

519
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:41,910
In a state of emergency,
disobedience will not be tolerated.

520
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,780
Dismissed.

521
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:50,950
- Okay, okay.

522
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:56,060
- So, uh, this is it.

523
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,360
- Oh yeah, yeah, yes yes.

524
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,570
- Okay you know and
if anything happens,

525
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:04,800
you just, you know.

526
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,070
- I know, I know,
I know, I know.

527
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,200
You want me to marry
your sister, right?

528
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,840
- No, no.

529
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,770
I'll be back to make
sure that doesn't happen.

530
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:12,610
Ah.

531
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:14,580
- Assuming this works,

532
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,780
how am I gonna know it works?

533
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:19,150
- I'm gonna use this beacon
to send us a little blip.

534
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,990
- That answers that question.

535
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:27,020
Now, what would you like
me to say to your wife?

536
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,320
- Tell her,

537
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,260
Tell her I love her.

538
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,630
I'm doing this for the child
that we never got to have.

539
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,470
- That sounds, terrible.

540
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:44,970
I'm going to make up something
much better later on ok?

541
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:46,440
Much more classy.

542
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,940
Then I'll deliver it
in my British accent,

543
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,080
and she'll love it, your
sister will love it,

544
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,310
- it's comforting.
- I get it.

545
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,850
- You know what I'm saying.
- Mm hmm.

546
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:53,750
- So this is gonna work?

547
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:56,220
What are you gonna do
when you get there?

548
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,420
- Tell the people what's coming.

549
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:01,160
- That's a little vague,
you'll look like a madman.

550
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,360
- Tell President Williams.

551
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,130
- And how you gonna
find President Williams?

552
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:06,800
- I don't know.

553
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,200
What university did President
Williams attend in 2017?

554
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,170
- President
Jack Williams lectured at

555
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:16,170
Chesterfield University
between 2013 and 2018.

556
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:17,110
- Think ahead, buddy.

557
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:17,910
- I've always got my answers.

558
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:18,910
Get in the coffin.

559
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:23,710
I can tell you this
stings by the way.

560
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:27,550
Hey mate?

561
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,420
Good luck.

562
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:32,660
- You're the one that
has to tell the girls.

563
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,260
- Very true.

564
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,190
Okay.

565
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:36,390
Adam, start the bio scan.

566
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:40,230
- Bio scan initiated.

567
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,830
- Alright, mate.

568
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,130
This'll put you to sleep.

569
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:46,430
Adam is the system ready?

570
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:52,470
- Bio scan complete, Thomas.

571
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:53,510
System ready.

572
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:54,980
- Alright.

573
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:55,980
Here we go.

574
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,150
Adam,

575
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:59,480
hit it!

576
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,880
- Time displacement
program initiated.

577
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:32,510
- What the hell is going on?

578
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:33,780
- Jesus, you scared
the heck out of me.

579
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,820
- Thomas, what the
hell is going on?

580
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:36,890
- He didn't tell you about this?

581
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:38,090
- Don't talk, talk to me.

582
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:40,590
- Okay, whoa whoa,
release, okay.

583
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:42,190
We found something.

584
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:58,270
- It's Biocorp.

585
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,310
- Oh God.

586
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,380
I have to go.

587
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,240
- What?

588
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,510
- I have to go.
- What?

589
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,750
What the hell are
you talking about?

590
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:05,680
- I have to lead
them away from us.

591
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,920
- What am I supposed to do?

592
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,850
- You don't need to
do anything, okay

593
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:09,080
the machine will run itself.

594
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,290
Okay, let me, if you
need to wake him,

595
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:11,520
- you use the adrenaline.
- Adrenaline, what?

596
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,520
- I thought you couldn't
wake anyone in stasis.

597
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,290
- Ah.
- Better not be true.

598
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,460
- Why do I have a funny feeling
I might be safer outside?

599
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,690
- Because you might.

600
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:20,100
Look, just wake him
up and we can go.

601
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,360
Wherever the hell you wanna go.

602
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,000
- Look, I can't, okay?

603
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:25,230
- What do you mean?

604
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,440
- Because I don't know how.

605
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,840
- What?

606
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,270
- Niko got in that machine
as a leap of faith.

607
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,880
Okay, he's doing it to save us.

608
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:37,210
All of us.

609
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,290
- They say you killed a trooper.

610
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:45,790
- Yeah, okay.
- What?

611
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:46,720
- They're here!

612
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,220
- How many?
- Whole platoon!

613
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,060
They've surrounded the building.

614
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:50,990
What's happening?

615
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:52,230
- Yeah, what is happening?

616
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:53,660
- Okay, let me explain
the most important thing

617
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,730
right now for us all is to
keep them out of this building.

618
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:57,700
- Okay, okay how do we do that?

619
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,900
- I don't know.

620
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,100
- Do we have any weapons?
- No.

621
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,070
- Ooh, oh what
abut the failsafe?

622
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,300
- No, is it even armed?

623
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,670
- I can arm it!
- No no no no no!

624
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:05,410
You'll kill the power.

625
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:06,240
- Okay, okay.

626
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,440
We need to stop them.

627
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,480
- If you kill the
power, you kill Niko.

628
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:24,430
- What do
we know about this place?

629
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:28,530
- Five floors, 25
citizens, all legal.

630
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,070
- Armed?

631
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,500
- We have to presume so, sir.

632
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,700
- Show me.

633
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,540
- Best breach points
are here, and here,

634
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,640
north and south walls.

635
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:40,140
- Can I leave this with you?

636
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:40,980
- Sure.

637
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:41,980
Thank you sir.

638
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:44,810
- Make it clean, Edier.

639
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:47,650
- Yes, sir.

640
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,190
- Everyone listen!

641
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:52,590
We've got a cure
for the pandemic,

642
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:55,760
but Biocorp are here
trying to steal it!

643
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,990
Protect this building and
I'll give you the cure!

644
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:01,500
- That's how he wants to play.

645
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:04,070
- You heard the man!

646
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:06,970
Look around and find yourself
something to use for a weapon!

647
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:09,810
- Take your assault positions.

648
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:11,870
- Sir!

649
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:21,320
- Well, that brings
up the eternal debate.

650
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,720
Would you kill Adolf Hitler?

651
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:27,990
Would you go back in time,
and end his life as a baby?

652
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:34,100
Okay, one at a
time, one at a time.

653
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,300
- Jeremy.

654
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,200
- Of course I'd
kill him as a baby.

655
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,800
I'd even murder his parents,

656
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,770
so they couldn't
create another monster.

657
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:44,970
- Well, who agrees
with that answer?

658
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,740
Michelle?

659
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,110
- Uh, um...

660
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,820
- I wouldn't want
to change past.

661
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:56,020
If not Hitler, it would
have been someone else.

662
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,890
It could have been
someone worse.

663
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:00,520
- Okay.

664
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,960
See, most of the world's
problems can be avoided,

665
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,860
if we lost the human
desire to meddle.

666
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:07,500
We're meddlesome.

667
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,500
And we shouldn't be.

668
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,730
Okay, that's it.

669
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:13,800
Guys read chapter
seven and eight,

670
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,200
might be a quiz next Friday.

671
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,400
Have a good night.

672
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:36,090
- Jack?

673
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:38,190
- Yes?

674
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:40,460
- Hey.

675
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,930
I'm a friend of your fathers.

676
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:47,700
Um, I was thinking about
throwing a party for him.

677
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,170
Seeing if you can,
give me a hand.

678
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:54,440
- You know, talk to my
brother about that stuff.

679
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,680
He's better and he's always
wanting to make daddy happy.

680
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,820
- No no no, see, uh, I need you.

681
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,320
You're, you're the guy I need.

682
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:06,550
- Okay well I, uh, teach
class in 30 minutes.

683
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:09,220
So time's not
really on our side.

684
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,220
- Very true.

685
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:14,000
- Find substation access
panel one three H.

686
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:15,860
Cut the feed.

687
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,700
Let's make 'em sweat in there.

688
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,700
- Yes sir.

689
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,710
- The power is in your hands.

690
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,340
- So, let me get this straight.

691
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,310
Firstly, you don't know my dad.

692
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:34,350
Secondly, I'm going to become

693
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:36,020
the President of
the United States,

694
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:39,960
and thirdly, be responsible
for the demise of the planet.

695
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:42,960
So you traveled back in time,

696
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:45,590
to warn me.

697
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:47,100
- Yes, look.

698
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,600
Jack.

699
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,730
You have the power to save
the entire human race.

700
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:51,970
Jack.

701
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:53,700
There's no kids left in 2037.

702
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:55,500
- Are you high right now?

703
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,110
- No, Jack I'm not high.

704
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:59,440
Look I know this sounds crazy
- Look it's been a pleasure

705
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,010
speaking with you, but I have
to prepare for mid terms.

706
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:03,210
- Please.

707
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:03,880
- No, I don't have
time for this.

708
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,910
- Look, look.

709
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:06,450
Listen to me.

710
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:09,680
I will do whatever it takes,

711
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,320
to save the entire world
from your bad decisions.

712
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:14,320
- You know what
this isn't right.

713
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,490
And you need help.

714
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:19,790
Okay.

715
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,460
- Sit down, jack.

716
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,480
- He's connected to
the box in stasis,

717
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,880
but his brain activity
is like he's awake.

718
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,550
- So it's looks like
he's walkin' around.

719
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,690
- Power cell breach.

720
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:44,650
Thomas.

721
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:46,050
System inline initiating.

722
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:47,220
- Oh bullocks.

723
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,220
Must hurry.

724
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:50,660
- What, what's happening?

725
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,960
- They're accessing
the local power grid.

726
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,790
We need to wake him up.

727
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:53,830
- What do you mean?

728
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:55,230
- What's going on?

729
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:56,630
- Biocorp outside are
accessing the local power grid.

730
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:58,130
- That can only mean one thing.

731
00:31:58,130 --> 00:31:59,100
- They're about to cut
the power for the building

732
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,070
before they storm in here.

733
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,000
- That'll cut the life support.

734
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,240
- Hence, we need to wake him up.

735
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,470
- Well, what about
a backup generator?

736
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:04,640
- That would buy us
time, hours only.

737
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,170
It doesn't fix the problem.

738
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:08,010
What we need to do is wake
him up so we can move him.

739
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:10,810
So I need a massive dose
of adrenaline to do that.

740
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:12,550
David, please get it for me!

741
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:15,050
David, please!

742
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:17,250
- Okay.

743
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:20,890
Is it safe?

744
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,160
- He can handle it.

745
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:26,230
Do it.

746
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:32,030
- Have you ever done
anything like this?

747
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:33,440
- Many times.

748
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,370
On mice.

749
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:35,370
- And how are they doing?

750
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:38,840
- Alright here we go.

751
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,340
- Alright c'mon let's do this.

752
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:44,950
- What the hell is going, help!

753
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,450
Hey somebody help!

754
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:57,990
- Turn it off now!

755
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:59,260
- Stop it!

756
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:01,030
- Stop it!
- It's out!

757
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,100
- Okay we need to flush
out the adrenaline.

758
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,040
He needs another IV line.

759
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,210
- A new IV line.
- Flush out the adrenaline.

760
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:13,380
- Right, okay, yeah.

761
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,980
Right.

762
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,810
- I'm sorry.

763
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:18,010
- You're sorry?

764
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:26,650
- What the hell's going on?

765
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:29,720
- What happened?

766
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,130
- You must be an
epileptic or something.

767
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:35,500
Please, untie me and let me
take you to the hospital!

768
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,000
- No, no, I just...

769
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,370
There's no way to,

770
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:40,700
we don't have time for that.

771
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:44,310
- How's he doing?

772
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:46,810
- Well, his
pressure's decreasing.

773
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:47,810
He'll be okay.

774
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,940
- He'll be okay?

775
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,210
- Jenny.
- He'll be okay.

776
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:52,950
Okay mister genius,
why don't you tell me,

777
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:54,120
why didn't it work?

778
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,780
- Because we've never
tried it before.

779
00:33:57,850 --> 00:33:59,150
- What?

780
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:00,960
- Jenny, we don't have
any ideas here, okay?

781
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:03,090
- Look, this is
uncharted territory.

782
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:04,790
We're figuring it out as we go.

783
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:07,630
Alright, we're tired, we're
under pressure, we need to

784
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:09,200
- Sleep.

785
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,000
- Sleep, we need
- No, no no no.

786
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,370
- Not us, we need hm to sleep.

787
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:15,400
- Now keep going.

788
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,970
- Brain activity.

789
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:18,170
What does it look
like on the monitor?

790
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:19,370
- It's like he's walking
around in the past.

791
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:20,710
- Okay, but he
couldn't make the trip

792
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:22,040
unless he was unconscious.

793
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:25,010
- So, maybe, if he were
unconscious in the past,

794
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:26,280
- He could make the trip home.

795
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,280
- Do it.

796
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,360
- Back up system engaged.

797
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,590
Please find an
alternative power source

798
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:39,760
- We don't have a lot
of time to tell him.

799
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,930
- To avert system failure.

800
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:42,660
- You know what,
here's a bright idea.

801
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,930
You sent him, you
bring him home.

802
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:48,870
- Must be something
wrong with the system.

803
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,040
We don't have time.

804
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:54,140
- What system, what
are you talking about?

805
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,150
- About you
destroying the world,

806
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,750
that's what we're talking about.

807
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:03,390
- Look, unfortunately, I
don't have time for this.

808
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:04,390
Okay?

809
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:09,060
- You,

810
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,330
you're gonna listen to
everything I have to say.

811
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,770
You and your father commission
a company called Biocorp.

812
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:19,600
- In 2037.

813
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,600
- Before then.

814
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:27,540
- You're not
epileptic, you're just crazy.

815
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,240
- Look, I didn't come
all this way for nothing.

816
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,280
- All the way from the future?

817
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,310
- Yes!
- 2037!

818
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:33,150
- Okay, fine!

819
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:34,650
Go, go ahead, amuse me!

820
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:36,120
- Amuse you, I'll amuse you.

821
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,690
Where I'm from, the
entire world is ending.

822
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:40,590
Do you even know
what that feels like?

823
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:42,020
Can you even comprehend that?

824
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:44,330
Can you?

825
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:46,630
- I've never seen
activists work like you!

826
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:48,060
Who is it you work for?

827
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,560
Greenpeace?

828
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,430
Or is this because my
father is a Senator?

829
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:52,430
- Jack, listen!

830
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,740
You're gonna be the
President in the future.

831
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:56,570
- Listening.

832
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:57,770
- Yes the President.

833
00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:00,210
And you're going to
ruin the entire future.

834
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:02,310
Because you don't
have the information.

835
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:04,380
But, Jack, listen.

836
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,580
I'm trying to give
you the information.

837
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,890
I'm trying to give
you the information.

838
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:11,890
You have to help me.

839
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:14,020
- You are crazy!

840
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,490
- Everything I'm telling
you is the truth.

841
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:19,990
- You wanna know the truth?

842
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:21,230
You have kidnapped, and you have

843
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:23,530
threatened the life
of a senators son!

844
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:24,730
- Jack.

845
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:26,230
- When my father
gets a hold of you,

846
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:28,400
you are gonna get
the death penalty!

847
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,070
- Yes sir, yes.

848
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:33,640
I'll notify him immediately.

849
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,040
- What's wrong?

850
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,280
- We need to initiate
protection protocol, Senator.

851
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,610
Your son's been
reported missing.

852
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:38,550
- The rest of the family?

853
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:39,350
- Being secured as we speak.

854
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:40,350
Please follow me.

855
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,360
- So you were gonna leave
without saying goodbye?

856
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,260
- I'm coming home.

857
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,630
- I saw the bags at the door.

858
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:54,700
You were gonna leave as
soon as you got here.

859
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:57,100
- I was just trying
to protect you.

860
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,200
You understand that?

861
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:02,500
I would never, ever hurt you.

862
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,910
You have no idea how
much I care about you.

863
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:05,910
Okay?

864
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:09,640
If I hurt you, it
would be a nightmare.

865
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,640
For me.

866
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:16,720
- You know, for a genius, you
don't know how dumb you are.

867
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,650
- Well you can beat me
up about how stupid I am

868
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:20,520
when I get home.

869
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,760
- It's a deal.

870
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,160
- I'll come back.

871
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:32,230
- You sure you wanna do this?

872
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:34,470
- No, no not really.

873
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:37,310
But, uh, he'd do
it for me though.

874
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,880
- Thomas.

875
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,450
- You bring back my husband.

876
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:47,780
- I'll try.

877
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,920
- We're ready for you now.

878
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:52,920
- Keep it on as
long as possible.

879
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,220
'Cause if we get cut off here,

880
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:56,190
I have no idea what
happens to us then.

881
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:00,760
Let's do this.

882
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,040
- They're inside.

883
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:09,870
- We have to get time.

884
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,210
- Let's go.

885
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:12,410
- Adam, run the program.

886
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,920
- Where did you come from?

887
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:31,090
Are you okay?

888
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:37,970
- I need to save us.

889
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:43,070
I need to find out where
Chester University campus is.

890
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,440
- It's two blocks that way.

891
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:47,040
- Thank you.

892
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,040
Yeah.

893
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:51,610
- Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack.

894
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:52,780
Listen to me.

895
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,020
I'm going to have to kill you

896
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:54,980
and your family if you
don't listen to me.

897
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,950
Like...

898
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,490
What the hell?

899
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:00,490
Thomas.

900
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:03,490
- We don't have
time to convince.

901
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:05,490
We can't take that risk.

902
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,300
- Hey.

903
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:13,130
- Hey.

904
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,070
Hey, it's going to be okay.

905
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,080
- Yeah.

906
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,510
- Thomas are you crazy?

907
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:24,810
- I'm starting to do something
definitive in this time.

908
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:25,750
- We had to!
- You can't

909
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:26,610
go around killing people!

910
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:28,150
Hey, hey!

911
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:28,980
I'm here.

912
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,350
It worked, it worked.

913
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:31,850
It's a time machine.
You guys made a time machine.

914
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:33,790
Which by the way is way
cooler than teleportation.

915
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:34,990
- How are the girls?
- Oh, they're freakin' out.

916
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:36,190
Which is why I'm here.

917
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:37,220
'Cause, cause we gotta
get you back now.

918
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,390
- No.

919
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:39,390
We're not leaving 'cause
nothing's changed.

920
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:40,390
- So how do we know?

921
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:41,330
- We'd have vanished, right?

922
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:42,730
We'd have reset in some way.

923
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:45,130
- What if, what if we're
protected in a temporal bubble?

924
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:46,630
- Yeah, yeah, yeah or
maybe nothing's changed.

925
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:48,540
The future is still there
waitin' for us and we gotta go.

926
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,770
- No no, we are not going
home until we know it worked.

927
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:52,570
Otherwise we made
the trip for nothing.

928
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:58,280
- Who's the President.

929
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,480
- President?

930
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,310
- The President.
- Who's the President?

931
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:01,310
- Williams.

932
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,080
- That can't be.

933
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,250
- Why?

934
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:06,590
- Because Thomas killed him.

935
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:10,160
- You killed John Williams?

936
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,330
- Yeah, and...

937
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:14,100
- Wait.

938
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,760
Who's John Williams?

939
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:20,470
- Did you...

940
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,340
Did you just kill Jack Williams?

941
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,810
- I did what I had to do.

942
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:31,050
Okay?

943
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:32,750
So who the hell
is John Williams?

944
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,660
- He's the President.

945
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:43,190
Who ran for office,
to make the world

946
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,260
a better, safer place

947
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:46,460
'cause they never caught the guy

948
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:48,100
who killed his
older brother Jack.

949
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,030
- You have a purpose.

950
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,770
Make your brother proud.

951
00:40:57,170 --> 00:40:58,370
- Yes, sir.

952
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:03,410
- Every day of your life,
you look in the mirror

953
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:06,450
and you see your brother in you!

954
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:08,580
See your mission.

955
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:09,580
Your purpose.

956
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,950
- Yes, sir.

957
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:20,030
- Go to your mother.

958
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:37,080
- So, we changed nuthin'.

959
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,080
- No, wait,

960
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:41,350
- we changed who was President.
- That was nothing.

961
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:42,750
- That's something.

962
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,290
- We changed the President.
- What did that

963
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:45,690
achieve, Thomas?

964
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:47,450
What did that achieve?

965
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:48,660
- I don't know.

966
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,590
- We still have a
world that's infertile.

967
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:52,590
You know, half the
world is dying.

968
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:54,430
Because the riots of
2023 still ravaged

969
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:55,430
every hope of us finding a cure!

970
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:56,600
- You mean 2021.

971
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,030
- What?

972
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:00,230
- No it doesn't matter.

973
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:01,170
- No what did you say?
- It might matter.

974
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:02,400
- No, I get what he's saying.

975
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,640
- What does it matter.
- When was the riots?

976
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,280
- Wait, what do you
mean, what, what year?

977
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,340
- 2021.

978
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,150
- We advanced the
riots by two years.

979
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:14,420
- How many people died?

980
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:20,120
- 90 million.

981
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,390
- We've added 40 million
to the death toll.

982
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:23,890
- What?

983
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:27,030
- When we left, the riots
of 2023, 50 million people.

984
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,860
We're making things worse.

985
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:30,860
And quicker.

986
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:34,740
We can fix it though.

987
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:36,200
- We can fix this.
- No, no.

988
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,610
We can't do this.

989
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:38,970
We can't do this.

990
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:39,970
We can't.

991
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,480
We can't.

992
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:47,110
- We can fix this.
- No more reaching.

993
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:49,250
- We were unable to trace them.

994
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:50,380
- What do you mean?

995
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:53,320
Find who killed my son.

996
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,920
- Sir, we know that
they're foreign.

997
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,420
Their accent, their clothing.

998
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:58,560
- Is that all you've been
able to come up with?

999
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:01,560
- We need a system.

1000
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,000
Secure the population.

1001
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,630
- Stop thinking and
talking and go find them!

1002
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:09,300
I want those men
that killed my son.

1003
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,200
- Yes sir.

1004
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:18,510
- We gotta be clever.

1005
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:19,510
And quick.

1006
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:21,880
Time is not on our side.

1007
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:23,950
- He's right.

1008
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:25,450
Biocorp is still outside
your door in 2037

1009
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:26,850
and they're not exactly
in a forgiving mood.

1010
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:27,790
- Wait, they're alone?

1011
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:28,990
- No they're buying us time.

1012
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:30,220
- And how are they
gonna do that?

1013
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:31,460
- Jenny's gonna
use the failsafe.

1014
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:32,690
- It's going to cut the
power to the machine.

1015
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:34,660
- The machine is
already out of power.

1016
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:36,100
We're on the backup
generators now,

1017
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:37,360
that's why I'm here.

1018
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,770
- And what happens
to us if the machine

1019
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:41,100
runs out of power while
we're still plugged in?
