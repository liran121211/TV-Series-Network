1
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,930
- Previously On Dystopia.

2
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:17,530
- Well the connections
been severed.

3
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:20,900
- Abandon your
ID chip program research.

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,370
Immediately.

5
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:23,670
- We need to get together
a bunch of scientists.

6
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,010
The best in the country.

7
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:26,010
Figure out how they built it,

8
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,440
what they're gonna do with it.

9
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,850
- So these machines
can transport a man

10
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,950
back in time.

11
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,280
- The safe
box contains blueprints

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,520
to the machine design.

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,050
Everything you'll need.

14
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,920
- I want you to write down any
and all numbers significant

15
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,920
to you and Nicholai.

16
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,330
- I know the combination,
I didn't give it to them.

17
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:47,030
- You don't want tests?
- Not with the animals.

18
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,570
- Word of advice kid.

19
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,430
Football's on it's way out.
Learn how to shoot a gun.

20
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,700
- I owe you far more
than I can ever repay.

21
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,870
- Perhaps we could pull
in a big favor one day.

22
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,310
- I'm gonna have to
kill you and your family

23
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:58,610
if you don't listen to me.

24
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:00,240
- Stop talking and go find him.

25
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,880
I want those men
that killed my son.

26
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,720
- Anything?

27
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,030
- Nope, I've
tried every single number

28
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:20,230
she gave me and every
single possible combination.

29
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:24,400
- Okay, she said there's
a key behind the wall.

30
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,740
You still got Ming
out there right?

31
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,140
- Yeah.
- Alright good.

32
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,140
Radio him and tell
him to get moving.

33
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,540
- Go by choice.
- What was that?

34
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,740
- Nothing.

35
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,250
There's got to be a
way to crack this open.

36
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,010
- You've seen the video, it'll
destroy everything inside.

37
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:39,220
- It's probably a bluff.

38
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,620
- There's only one way in.

39
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,890
That's through the
combination, figure it out.

40
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:44,350
- She is hiding something.

41
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,360
- Probably.
- I'm not hiding anything.

42
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,790
I've given you every
meaningful number

43
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,230
that I can think of.

44
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,460
- So where's this place?

45
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,130
- In what used to be Vegas.

46
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:55,800
Here.

47
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,400
Here is the address.

48
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,140
There is a community of
people that are living

49
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:00,940
outside of Biocorporal.

50
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,210
Peacefully living.

51
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:03,940
- Sweetheart, crying
is about as much use

52
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,510
as tits on a bull.

53
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:08,680
- Okay, we'll get
our guy out there.

54
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,110
But it'll take a bit of time.

55
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,080
- Thank you.

56
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:07,100
- And now
for tonight's top story.

57
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:10,510
Today Nobel Peace Prize
winning BIOCORP made history

58
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,610
by administering
the cure for cancer.

59
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:15,110
Available to the entire
world's population

60
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,280
in exchange for their
compulsory enrollment

61
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,720
in the ID chip program.

62
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,890
Which allows for increased
population security.

63
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:24,390
BIOCORP CEO stated,
"It takes a brave man"

64
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,760
"to knock on the
door of evolution"

65
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,860
"without knowing what
lies on the other side".

66
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,860
"But we've taken the
first brave step"

67
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,100
"to improving our
children's future today".

68
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,500
"Go through the door
and what awaits you"

69
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,500
"on the other side is
something worth fighting for".

70
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,440
Wise words indeed.

71
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,840
And a momentous
day for all of us.

72
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,040
I'm sure you can agree.

73
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,270
- And we're clear.

74
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,190
- There's been another
development sir.

75
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,750
- Well I would imagine it is.

76
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,820
We're not here to
chit chat, what is it?

77
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,990
- Well sir, apparently
the Unity of Lost Children

78
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,290
have their meeting
room scientists.

79
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,900
- I was told they were all dead.

80
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,600
- That report was
erroneous, sir.

81
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,070
Seems they were
rescued by the children

82
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:12,170
after we took the building.

83
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:14,500
- We have the building.
- Yes sir.

84
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,010
We have it again.

85
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,740
There was a second assault.

86
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,110
- The Speaker lied to me.

87
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,040
- Perhaps sir, but the
information coming in right now

88
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,480
is just so unclear
that we don't...

89
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,150
- Don't try to cover up for him.

90
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:27,220
- No sir, I'm just trying
to clarify this situation.

91
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,150
- We need to look at this
as a golden opportunity.

92
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,360
Those rebels have been
a thorn in my side

93
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,260
for a very, very long time.

94
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:38,160
Unfortunately, launching
an all out assault

95
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,330
upon them has been a very
unpopular distraction.

96
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:47,900
You tell The Speaker that we
will not tolerate failure.

97
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,440
- Yes sir, immediately.

98
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:04,950
In here soldier.

99
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,990
- You sure this safe sir?

100
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,190
- It's worked before.

101
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,430
- Good thing sir.

102
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,530
- Remember when you
get to the other side

103
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:15,530
find them.

104
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,800
- They're very dead sir.
- Not in 2017.

105
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:23,540
Our scientists have discovered
they are alive and well.

106
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,380
Get as much recon as you can.

107
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,180
- Do you wan them
dead or alive sir?

108
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:30,610
- Whatever's most expedient.

109
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,980
You'll not only be doing
BIOCORP and mankind a favor,

110
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,720
but the Lord Almighty
is on our side

111
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,720
in this struggle.

112
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,820
It's good versus evil.

113
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,560
- What if I get stuck sir?

114
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,030
- Like them.
- You won't.

115
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:46,030
They weren't the sharpest tools.

116
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:49,600
You are trained BIOCORP soldier.

117
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,600
- Yes sir.

118
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,840
- Your time of glory is at hand.

119
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,140
- Here soldier, take this.

120
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,610
Thank you sir.

121
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,350
Let's do it.

122
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,190
- Everybody out.

123
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,830
- Activate.
- Clear.

124
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,460
- Five,

125
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,100
four, three,

126
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,760
two,

127
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,800
one.

128
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,140
- What's wrong?

129
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,140
I have no idea.

130
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,450
- Help me sir.

131
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:51,700
- Prep it for the next one.

132
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:55,030
- Maybe
we should use lab animals.

133
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,070
It takes less time.

134
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:58,130
- It's less...
- Less what?

135
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,440
- Expensive.

136
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,040
- Dead soldiers are free.

137
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,370
Fix it.

138
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,010
Prep for the next one.

139
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,710
- Burn all this.

140
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,450
Send in the next one.

141
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,790
- You know they don't
all believe in it.

142
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:22,990
- Huh?

143
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:23,990
- Time travel.

144
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:28,230
- I do.
- What are you talking about?

145
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,100
- I took your advice, buddy.

146
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:33,770
I gave up football and
I learned to shoot.

147
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,210
- What, that was you?

148
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:38,540
- That was what a
few days ago for you?

149
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,580
- Yeah.
- 20 years ago for me.

150
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:43,010
But I bet I remember
it just as well.

151
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,850
- I remember you
never said thank you.

152
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:48,750
- Thank you, the world
ended four years later

153
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,220
and you knew it was coming.

154
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,820
Why would I possibly thank you?

155
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,300
- We're gonna get that combo.

156
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:07,570
Leave me.

157
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:40,240
- So, how are we
gonna get to the sea

158
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,110
with all these fools around?

159
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:47,040
- Gotta keep Travis
occupied for one thing.

160
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,080
- And I suppose you
have a plan for that?

161
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:50,980
- Poison?

162
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,880
- That's a bit extreme,
don't you think?

163
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,880
- I'm not so sure.

164
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,220
- How are we gonna find
poison in this dump?

165
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,830
- Pretty poison?

166
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,700
Okay.

167
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:11,370
I guess I'll have
to do what it takes.

168
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,870
- We have to protect the future.

169
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:17,510
- Don't try to make your
idea of me seducing someone

170
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:19,380
into some sort of
lofty word say.

171
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,380
- Okay.

172
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,080
You gotta get nasty
with him in there

173
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,710
for us to get the
hell outta here.

174
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:33,660
- Hey, if anything
happens I need to tell you

175
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,890
the nomination.

176
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,250
- Should be some over here.

177
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,660
- That's him.
- Yeah that's him?

178
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,890
- Yeah.

179
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,290
- Are you sure
that's the right guy?

180
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:10,230
- It's definitely the right guy.

181
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,460
- Alright, let's go.

182
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:14,430
- Excuse me, sir are
you Professor Howard?

183
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:16,670
- Yes, I am.

184
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,530
- I'm Nicholai.
- And I'm Thomas.

185
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,540
I'm sorry we're massive fans.

186
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,970
- Nice to meet you gentleman.

187
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,410
- Wow.
- Can't believe it.

188
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:25,880
It's such a great honor.

189
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,310
Your accomplishments,
everything you wrote here

190
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,380
is amazing.

191
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:33,350
- Really I'm flattered.

192
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:36,150
- See we're authors and...
- Right.

193
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:36,990
- And we wanted to
write a book about you...

194
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:37,990
- And your genius.

195
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,790
- What about me exactly,
do you want to write about?

196
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,060
May we ride with you

197
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,790
and we'll take a
moment to tell you.

198
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,230
- Right after you sir, come on.

199
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:47,400
- Please.
- I guess.

200
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,730
- This is so unreal, huh?

201
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,670
- Professor, we'd like
to talk to you about

202
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:59,140
writing a book
about your research.

203
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,710
Theories on temporal physics.

204
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:03,650
I've never quite heard
it called that before.

205
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:04,850
- Well we think
it's the best way

206
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:06,550
to describe what it is you do.

207
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,050
- Yeah.

208
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:10,320
- Still doing a research
based book on a researcher

209
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,360
that's very meta.

210
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:19,230
Oh great.

211
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,700
- Are we stuck?
- I don't know.

212
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,500
- I certainly hope not.

213
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,830
- Call.
- What?

214
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,630
- Hit the call button.

215
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:26,630
- What's the call?

216
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,340
- Look Professor...
- Perfect.

217
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,040
- The meda, what was
that thing you said

218
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,310
about the meda?

219
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:36,180
- Meta with a T.

220
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,550
Research on researchers?

221
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,150
- Professor maybe we
could just ask you

222
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,950
a couple of questions you know.

223
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:44,420
- About me or time travel?

224
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,960
- What we need is your
personal, how should I say?

225
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,630
- Ethical.
- Ethical take on the matter,

226
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,930
you know.

227
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:53,530
- Look, presently I just
don't have a lot of time

228
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:55,600
to deal with this.

229
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,800
- That isn't true at all Professor.
- We have loads of time.

230
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,500
So how about we just
ask you a few questions.

231
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,700
We'll jot down some notes,
take it back to the editor.

232
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,570
- Yeah.
- Then come back

233
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:03,640
with a book proposal.

234
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,640
- Who's your editor?

235
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:07,640
- Jennifer.
- Jennifer.

236
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,980
- The good one.
- Good, good one.

237
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,350
- Yeah.
- Is she a science editor?

238
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:15,520
Because I don't want anybody
who doesn't understand

239
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,620
what I'm talking about
overseeing a book about me

240
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,290
and my work.

241
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:21,960
- No, no, no, no.

242
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,830
I can assure you
between the two of us

243
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:27,730
we know enough about
this to do this justice.

244
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,200
- Trust me.
- Yeah.

245
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,230
- So

246
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:34,840
what kind of deal do we
have on the table here?

247
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,410
- A deal.

248
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,610
- The money gentleman?

249
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:40,810
- The money.

250
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:43,950
- This is like a first.

251
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:45,650
- This is more like a
conversational kinda thing.

252
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:47,050
And then we're gonna
you know cross the T's,

253
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,320
dot the I's and then boop.

254
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,620
- This is probably a
matter better taken up

255
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,820
with my literary agent
if you wouldn't mind.

256
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,730
- They know the combination.

257
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:57,890
Watch them closely.

258
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,010
- I hope to teach a class
on time travel someday.

259
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:12,880
- That would be fantastic.

260
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,710
- Sign us up, right.

261
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:18,880
- But it's been difficult
to convince administration

262
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,880
it's worth it.

263
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,020
Practicality is the bottom
line order of the day.

264
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:30,690
There's no such thing as pure
research universities anymore.

265
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:33,830
- Perhaps our work together
will convince him otherwise.

266
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:37,230
See that they need
this class, you know.

267
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:40,000
- That is your best
selling point yet.

268
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,110
- Imagine that time
travel schools.

269
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:46,680
- Now that would
be something wouldn't it?

270
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,980
'Course you'd probably
have the problem

271
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,150
of the seniors
ditching out on class

272
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:53,020
once they figured out they
could party in ancient Babylon.

273
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:59,820
- So professor, tell us.

274
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:03,030
Are there rules to time travel?

275
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:05,390
- Ah, now we get
to the fun stuff.

276
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,070
- What I'm trying to say
is can you explain it

277
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:11,530
in the most practical
application?

278
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,440
- Of course.

279
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,170
Are there rules, well sure.

280
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:21,110
And they are quite
serious actually.

281
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,010
If you don't follow them
you could end up dead,

282
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:27,020
lost in time, or the
most frightening of them

283
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,990
you could destroy the future.

284
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:34,320
- Some people might want
to destroy the future.

285
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:38,960
So what are these rules exactly?

286
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,300
- Well the first one is the one

287
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,500
that most people
fundamentally misunderstand

288
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,270
and I blame it on
lack of knowledge,

289
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:48,470
Hollywood, what have you.

290
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,240
Well, here it is.

291
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,010
You cannot

292
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,980
change the past.

293
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,820
No way, no how.

294
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,590
- You cannot, or you should not?

295
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:04,990
- Can not.

296
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:08,090
- Why?

297
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:10,330
Because the Butterfly Effect?

298
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:12,330
- In a way.

299
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,300
- Okay so.

300
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:17,870
What you're saying is you
can't even alter the past,

301
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:18,970
not even a little bit?

302
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,310
- If you change it
even a little bit

303
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:24,010
you throw everything
else out of whack.

304
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:25,470
- Well that makes it
sound like you can,

305
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,110
you just shouldn't.

306
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:29,410
- In a sense it's both.

307
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:32,720
If you try and change the past,

308
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,980
something in the past,
the future changes.

309
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:39,620
Therefore what was the past,
ceases to be your past.

310
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,360
- Sounds like an
existential problem to me.

311
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:47,860
- The problem of one's
existence is very real here,

312
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:51,430
and not a theoretical
or spiritual plane.

313
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:52,870
- I don't get it,
I don't understand.

314
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:57,270
Imagine you had a time
machine that you could use.

315
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:59,980
Give it some kind of
practical example.

316
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,180
If I were to go
back to yesterday

317
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,610
and force myself to
stay in bed all day.

318
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:06,250
I have not changed the past.

319
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,580
What I have done in
essence just changed

320
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:12,120
that specific moment
in that present.

321
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,660
So everything that comes
after that is a new reality

322
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:17,590
based on that choice.

323
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:19,900
So if I return to today,

324
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:23,100
even if my staying in
bed had real, clear,

325
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:26,770
recognizable consequences
I would only recognize it

326
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:29,970
as a result of my new present.

327
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:32,410
You can change the future,

328
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:36,380
but you can not change

329
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,380
the past.

330
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,720
- Okay, so I get it now.

331
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,790
So in that sense the
future is never new,

332
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:46,260
but simply your current reality.

333
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:49,290
- Exactly.
- No, no.

334
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,930
What does that movie tell
us in Back to the Future?

335
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,400
That if we have the technology,

336
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,670
we can go back in time
and we can change things.

337
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:59,400
And it will effect everything,
past, present, and future.

338
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,600
It's like a documentary
to you people, right?

339
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:04,410
- Well not really.

340
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:08,010
It's full of holes and
there's one major difference.

341
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:09,010
- What's that?

342
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:12,750
- I've never traveled
through time.

343
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,220
- Professor, we've also
seen that you've written

344
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,730
a lot about temporal distortion.

345
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:25,590
Can you ad lib on that?

346
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:28,800
- Yes, it's a key
component of my research.

347
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,100
And one of the primary
tenants of time travel.

348
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,300
Though I'm still trying
to discover the mechanics

349
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,310
of it on a theoretical plane.

350
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,240
- Why only on a
theoretical sense?

351
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,810
- Because unless you know
somebody who's holding out

352
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,810
on me and the rest of the world.

353
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:46,320
Mechanically it
does not exist yet.

354
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,550
- It doesn't have to exist yet.

355
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:49,950
It can exist tomorrow.

356
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,650
Isn't that the wonderful
realm of possibility

357
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:52,890
that we're talking about?

358
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:56,960
- Professor, does
temporal distortion

359
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,330
allow physical coexistence
on all parts of time?

360
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,500
- Why do you ask?

361
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:07,770
- Think about it
on two time planes.

362
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:11,040
Can one body coexist on both
time planes concurrently?

363
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:14,010
- Where are you getting
these questions from?

364
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,180
- Yeah, you.
- Your research.

365
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:23,050
You've done so much of it,
it's gone quite in depth.

366
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:25,920
- And we drew our
own conclusions

367
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,890
about the nature of time.

368
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:31,590
- But also wanted to learn
about time travel for ourselves.

369
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,870
- It would seem the two
of you know a lot more

370
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:41,040
about little old moi
than you've let on.

371
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,210
- Our guy's on the way.

372
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,610
He'll get there soon.

373
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:51,610
- I don't know that
Nico was thinking.

374
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:53,880
- That's a good question.
- So now what?

375
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,920
- We turn to the past.
- How the machine's

376
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,920
at the apartment.

377
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,430
- We are running out of time.

378
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:13,040
So I'm gonna give you
one simple command.

379
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,040
Give me the combo.

380
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,370
- I don't know the combination.

381
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:17,370
I told you.

382
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:21,010
- I'll tell you what I'd like.

383
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,710
I'd like to defeat BIOCORP
and save the future.

384
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:31,720
But I'd like help in doing that.

385
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,490
But I don't seem to be
getting help that I need.

386
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:37,330
In the immortal words of
the great George W. Bush,

387
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:39,760
"You're either with
us, or against us".

388
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,270
- Which one are you?
- I'm with you.

389
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,300
I'm with you.

390
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,570
- Then give me the combination.

391
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:45,600
Shooting me is not
going to help you.

392
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,170
- What will?
- Trust.

393
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:51,440
- Trust?
- Trust.

394
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,080
Put down the gun.

395
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,480
Huh, put it down.

396
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:01,820
I'm surprised at you.

397
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:05,290
I'm surprised that you
haven't figured it out.

398
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:08,860
- I don't know what
he could have meant.

399
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:09,860
- Oh no, not that.

400
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:14,760
Stop talking about
him, he's gone.

401
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:21,740
This is about new
beginnings anyway, right?

402
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:25,940
You know.

403
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,440
You're so tough.

404
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,310
But underneath it

405
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:37,290
- I suspect you're kind.
- You don't know me.

406
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:38,750
- I want to change that.

407
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:45,890
I bet you're all muscle.

408
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,670
So hard,

409
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:54,140
- nice.
- You aint seen nothing yet.

410
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:58,070
- I haven't seen enough.

411
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,010
I know that.

412
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:06,980
- You disappoint me though.
- How is that?

413
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,960
- A gentleman always
offers a lady a drink.

414
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,330
- What's a lady drink?

415
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:44,390
Pour yourself some.

416
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:45,390
- No.

417
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,390
Straight from the bottle for me.

418
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,700
Come closer.

419
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,240
- Bitch.

420
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:11,680
Drop the bottle now.

421
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,850
Liar.

422
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:20,560
Get into the safe room now.

423
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,530
- Copy that, heading
to the safe room now.

424
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:24,530
- Ow, ow.

425
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,100
- You're hurting me.
- I'm devastated by that.

426
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,830
- I just didn't trust you.

427
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:31,600
- Too late to be an apologist.

428
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,900
- I'll do whatever you want.

429
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,940
- Oh, I know you will.

430
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:38,510
- Okay the principles.

431
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:42,850
Okay our theory of coexistence
on both time periods.

432
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,010
The time distortion allows it.

433
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:47,350
- So wait a minute.

434
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:49,050
How do you know that
there's a distortion?

435
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:51,390
- Because it's one of the
basics of time and space.

436
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:53,090
In order to make
any time travel trip

437
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:54,660
you have to bend or rip that.

438
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:58,130
- And so you postulate
that this distortion

439
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:01,500
allows for an entity
to exist in both sides

440
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:06,070
of the time and both
sides of the bend.

441
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,740
- Yes.
- Yeah, like a mirror.

442
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:10,670
- But instead of

443
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:16,110
a reflection of
atomic light particles

444
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:20,850
it's a reflection of
atomic carbon particles.

445
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:22,550
- Yes.
- The person is

446
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:24,120
the reflection and like
the light particles

447
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,720
they exist on both sides.

448
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,160
- Yeah.
- Exactly.

449
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,860
- Brilliant.
- Yeah.

450
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,260
- F equals MA, mate.

451
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,260
Take everything we
have said as read.

452
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,000
But now we have another problem.

453
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,770
- The time that exists in
between the two periods

454
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:40,740
that's what we haven't
figured out yet.

455
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,640
- Let me have a try at it.
- Yeah, please.

456
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,940
- And I thought you
came to interview me

457
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,340
for a book.

458
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,080
- Yeah, we do.

459
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,580
- It's fine if you don't.

460
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:55,580
I mean we're all sort of
brothers in arms in this.

461
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,120
But let's have a look at this.

462
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:01,720
Alright, if you
take this equation

463
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,090
and you get rid of this.

464
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:12,640
This didn't come from
any equation of mine.

465
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,370
- Nope, we read all of
your materials every day.

466
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,440
Actually, it's just you.

467
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,710
- Don't mistake middle
age for gullible.

468
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:27,150
- We were inspired
professor by circumstance.

469
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:29,320
- Where did the
question come up?

470
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:33,920
Why would it be
necessary to answer some?

471
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,190
What's that?

472
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:36,790
- It's just a tattoo.
- Who do you work for?

473
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:37,790
- What do you mean?

474
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,830
- I've seen barcode tattoos
before and I've always thought

475
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:44,370
they were sort of an
odd personal choice.

476
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:45,370
But let me see it?

477
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:48,140
That a sign that
only lets you know

478
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,140
that was not a scar once.

479
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,740
Who do you work for?

480
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,740
- No one.

481
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:56,210
We're alone, professor.

482
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:01,780
- Where are you from?

483
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:04,220
- That's kinda hard to explain.

484
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:08,660
- Try explaining
it scientifically.

485
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,690
- How about we explain
it hypothetically.

486
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:12,660
- Yeah.

487
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,170
- There are two chaps
trapped in a past

488
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:18,200
they don't belong to.

489
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:20,400
They've made the
trip from a future

490
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,070
they don't want to go back to.

491
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:23,970
And they're trying
to change things.

492
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:27,010
And we need some help.

493
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:28,640
- What happened?

494
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,710
Hypothetically?

495
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:34,780
- Hypothetically speaking,
let's say they got disconnected

496
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,450
from the future.

497
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:39,290
- You can't get
disconnected from the future

498
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:41,960
because if you disconnect
the time space continuum

499
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,160
then they would
just cease to exist.

500
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,730
- And yet here we are.

501
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:47,600
- They are.
- Here they are.

502
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:49,860
- Yeah.

503
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:52,130
- Hypothetically.

504
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,170
- Well perhaps not then.

505
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:59,240
- Problem they face professor
is that they can't get home.

506
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,510
- How did they
get here or to this time

507
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:06,680
in the first place?

508
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:11,720
- Let's say they built
a machine of some sort.

509
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,590
- The one that bent the
temporal distortion.

510
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:15,590
- Yes.

511
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:18,390
- Why don't they just build
another machine and go back?

512
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:20,600
- Because you can't build a
machine to travel forward.

513
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,100
- Then they are stuck here.

514
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,900
Living out someone
else's future.

515
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:35,040
- They could send a
message to the future

516
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,650
and the machine
could reconstructed.

517
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:42,180
And then, they could
reconnect to the continuum.

518
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:45,890
And possibly that way
they might get home.

519
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,260
- That'll work.

520
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:52,130
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

521
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,700
- Oh how about that?

522
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,730
- Thank you so much professor.

523
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:00,500
- Wait aren't you guys
coming back to my office?

524
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,770
- Oh, we have to go now.

525
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:03,240
- Look I've got like
a thousand questions

526
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,670
I've got to ask.

527
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:05,540
- Professor I promise we're
come and see you again

528
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,940
- and we'll talk.
- Yeah.

529
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,080
- Can I see your arm?

530
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:13,820
- It's the same as his.

531
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:15,850
- Please?

532
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,990
- Is this what we have
to look forward to?

533
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:28,660
- Not if we can help it.

534
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,830
- Good luck.
- You too.

535
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,650
- So what do you think?
- About what?

536
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:49,620
- About sending a message.

537
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:52,050
- I think it's worth a try.

538
00:27:58,890 --> 00:27:59,900
- That creep built this cage.

539
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,730
It's got to have
a freaking flaw.

540
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:12,040
- What are you
doing, what's wrong?

541
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:15,240
- He was watching
us the entire time.

542
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,280
Listening to every word.

543
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:20,710
Just waiting.

544
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:24,150
- I know you're
watching us creep.

545
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:27,460
I dare you to come down
here and that with me.

546
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,330
- I messed up David pretty bad.

547
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,300
- And you did nothing?

548
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:41,600
- It's not fair.

549
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,370
- None of this is fair Jenny.

550
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:45,940
- Oh, I see so.

551
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:48,580
If I'm not screaming
at the walls

552
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,050
I'm not doing us any good?

553
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:52,780
- Oh yeah, whatever you're
doing isn't doing us any good.

554
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,180
- Well at least I'm
doing something.

555
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,750
I'm not just criticizing.

556
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:57,250
- Okay, okay.

557
00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:00,090
Trying to seduce some guy is
that what we're doing now?

558
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:01,660
- What do you want from me, huh?

559
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:06,030
- Look I miss Thomas and
my brother just as much

560
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,300
as you, okay.

561
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:24,950
What do you think
they're doing to David?

562
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,280
- Besides Thomas, Nico.

563
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,490
David's the only one
who knows the machine.

564
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:33,460
What do you think
they're doing Lauren?

565
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,960
- You think he'll break?

566
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:44,130
- Everybody breaks.

567
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,970
Everybody breaks.

568
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:53,910
- Aright the safe contains
an acidic substance.

569
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:56,280
If anyone forces it
the vial will break

570
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,610
and all data will be lost.

571
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:00,610
Jenny

572
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,320
I love you.

573
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,420
You're the only one who has
the combination to this.

574
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:12,060
Got it.

575
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,530
- How was it?

576
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:15,460
- It's good.
- Okay.

577
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:17,630
Oh.

578
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:19,530
- Oh, hey Doc.

579
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,000
How's your father?

580
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,910
- Alive, he's alive.

581
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:25,340
A sunburst of energy.

582
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:27,840
We had the kind of conversations
we had back in the day.

583
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,010
- That's good to hear.

584
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:30,880
- We have the
blueprints for you now.

585
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,450
We're gonna give it to you
the next time we see you.

586
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:35,120
We need you to put it in a safe.

587
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,620
You know where and you know
how we want it rigged right?

588
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,990
- Yes.

589
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:42,090
- Now Doc, my wife has
the combination to this.

590
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,930
You know when it's
the right time.

591
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:45,490
- Incredible to think of that.

592
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:46,790
I'll do my best to make sure

593
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:48,430
that everything happens
the way it should.

594
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,300
- No don't try too hard.

595
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,300
Just live your life.

596
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,900
- But you are a
part of that right?

597
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,400
Aren't you?

598
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,640
- I suppose that's true.

599
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,140
- When you meet with the nurse

600
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,610
I've given her all the
information you requested

601
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:01,780
along with some cash.

602
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,280
- Thanks Doc.

603
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,510
- It's the least
that I could do.

604
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:06,650
I told you I could
never repay you.

605
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:08,280
- You don't need to.

606
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,280
You're a good man.

607
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:11,420
- You mentioned a list?

608
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:13,260
- Yeah, we need their addresses.

609
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,460
- From who?

610
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:15,720
- There's eight of
them that are pivotal

611
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,430
to this BIOCORP project
that we're dealing with.

612
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:20,830
They're a huge key to
the launch of the virus.

613
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:22,360
- And what will you do to them?

614
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:26,330
- What we have to.

615
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,000
- Hopefully they listen

616
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,510
and do the right thing.

617
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:32,740
- But if they don't Doc,
you know what's at stake.

618
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:33,940
- I have to go.

619
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:36,240
- Look we need it
soon though, Doc okay.

620
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,480
- I understand.

621
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,610
Give the list of
names to the nurse

622
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:40,350
along with the data.

623
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:42,880
- And I'll work on it quickly.
- Okay thanks Doc.

624
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,720
Talk to you soon.

625
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:54,100
- So this list huh?

626
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,330
It's a death list.

627
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,670
How do you want to handle that?

628
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:03,570
- Split it up.

629
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,910
- You know I think we
should stick together.

630
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:07,880
- No, cover more
ground that way.

631
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,580
- We'll save time.
- Ah, time.

632
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:14,080
That precious commodity
that we have so little

633
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,220
and so much of.

634
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,860
- We don't have much
time here though.

635
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:20,720
- Did you mean what you said?

636
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:23,630
About killing those
that don't listen?

637
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:29,000
- It's only our
last resort, okay.

638
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,300
- Yeah.

639
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,100
Just worried about
the Butterfly Effect.

640
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,100
- I am too.

641
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,670
Thomas this may
be our only chance

642
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,610
to ensure we have a future.

643
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:43,850
Nico, what if something
else happens, huh?

644
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:44,980
I don't know.

645
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,480
What if a meat virus happens?

646
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,150
They'll start killing
everybody in the meat factory.

647
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:49,750
- Thomas.

648
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,390
We both know that
doesn't happen.

649
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:52,890
- It might, Nico.

650
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:54,890
We're here, we're
changing things.

651
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,890
- But you heard the professor.

652
00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:58,930
We can't change the past.

653
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:00,060
- This isn't our past.

654
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:03,100
This isn't some date
and time we read about

655
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,100
in a history book.

656
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:06,870
This doesn't belong to us.

657
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:07,870
It's different.

658
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:10,870
Our past is gone.

659
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:12,840
Our future's gone.

660
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,340
We're changing everything.

661
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:16,610
- The future's here.

662
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:19,250
My wife is here.

663
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:23,390
- I'm not blind to why we're
doing what we're doing, Nico.

664
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,320
I miss her too.

665
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:31,160
I'm just saying we
gotta be careful.

666
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,790
- We are being careful.

667
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:34,860
We have to be brave too.

668
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,800
- Yeah.

669
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,540
This place.

670
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,840
Feels different.

671
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:47,940
Cold.

672
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:49,940
Empty.

673
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,350
Doesn't feel like home.

674
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:55,050
Not without them.

675
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,690
- We can make it home.

676
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:02,490
Starting today.

677
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:21,280
I miss them too.

678
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,420
- Senator.

679
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,560
Thank you very much
for seeing me sir.

680
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,620
- Ah, you're
welcome, have a seat.

681
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:42,330
So.

682
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,030
How can I help you?

683
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:46,900
- Well actually, I
think it's more about

684
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:47,900
how I can help you.

685
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,340
I've heard that line before.

686
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:56,340
And it usually means
I help you first.

687
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,340
- Okay fair enough.

688
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:00,350
But Senator

689
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:05,690
what is the single greatest
threat people face?

690
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:07,990
Whether on foreign
or domestic soil?

691
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:11,360
- Terrorism.
- Of course.

692
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:16,000
Whether it's violent
or cyber or whatever.

693
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,600
What do all the
intelligence agencies

694
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,270
always like to complain
about lacking the most?

695
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:22,640
- Intelligence.

696
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:25,670
- Assets.

697
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:28,840
Because when you
really think about it

698
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,810
what we like to
call intelligence

699
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:33,750
is really just the
process of gathering

700
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:35,920
as much information as possible

701
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,120
from as many different
sources as possible.

702
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:54,070
- What are these?

703
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,700
- Oh those?

704
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,740
Those sir, that's
just the future.

705
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,380
- The future?

706
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,380
Huh?

707
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:06,880
- It's because I have
a vision of a world

708
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:09,980
that we'll all be
able to live in.

709
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:12,490
It has absolutely zero crime.

710
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,220
Zero.

711
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:18,290
Because every single
person is gonna be able

712
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:21,460
to be tracked via a computer

713
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:24,430
and microchip networking system
that we are going to build.

714
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,600
And that way, if somebody
does commit a crime

715
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,940
they will instantaneously
be able to be tracked,

716
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:37,750
apprehended, and prosecuted
in accordance with the law.

717
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:42,380
Never again will
someone get away with...

718
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,030
- Ray give me a moment please?

719
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,030
- Yes sir.

720
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:59,500
- I'm listening Mr. Tinker.

721
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:01,670
How does this work?

722
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:04,970
- So is gonna work?

723
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:06,710
I mean it's the only way we're
gonna get around separately.

724
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:08,540
I know but why would
you give me a car?

725
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,140
I don't exactly got money.

726
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:13,080
- Don't worry about
that, I got that covered.

727
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,950
Use this card once and
toss it, throw it away.

728
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,820
- I guess I'll wait out here.

729
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:19,890
- I'll be right back.

730
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:32,500
- Well?

731
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,000
- How are we gonna get
the people to swallow

732
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,740
this potentially bitter pill?

733
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:39,010
I mean, allowing them
all to be tagged.

734
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:40,310
I mean convincing our own people

735
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:41,580
is gonna be tough enough.

736
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:45,410
But you are telling me
that the entire world

737
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:47,380
is going to fall in line.

738
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:49,120
- You don't advertise
it by saying,

739
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,090
"Oh, you're gonna
be safe from crime".

740
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:52,490
You make the people want it.

741
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,020
- Go on.

742
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,930
- Well, guess we gotta
take care of business.

743
00:37:57,930 --> 00:37:59,430
- Well let's not mess this up.

744
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:02,160
- Don't look at me
when you say that.

745
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,300
- We gotta do whatever it
takes to change the world.

746
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,770
- Yeah, good luck.

747
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:07,370
Hey Nicholai?

748
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,340
Let's give them a chance to
change their minds, okay.

749
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:15,080
- I'm the compassionate
one, remember.

750
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,980
- I know but I messed up
with that BIOCORP guy.

751
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:19,280
And I think if we
give them a chance

752
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,480
we could save everybody.

753
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,050
- I agree.

754
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:24,050
See you soon.

755
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,840
- These are medical files.

756
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:52,850
Ingenious, the chip is some
sort of medical device.

757
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:59,290
This indicates that
you have been sitting

758
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:00,390
on the cure for cancer.

759
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,790
- Remember that pill
we were talking about?

760
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:04,790
- Yeah.

761
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:07,030
- That's how we sweeten it up.

762
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,500
Not only that but
the chip is capable

763
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,940
of monitoring, storing,
and transmitting

764
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:17,170
life saving immediate
bodily functions.

765
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:18,440
- I mean, what are the
people going to think

766
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,210
when they find out that
they are being monitored

767
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:21,440
all the time?

768
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,180
- They'll know they're
being saved from cancer.

769
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:25,210
They're gonna sign up for it.

770
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:27,820
I mean, we're not gonna
hide the fact from 'em.

771
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:30,590
And at first it's gonna
feel a little overwhelming

772
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:31,890
but this is gonna
go down in history

773
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:34,960
as being the single
greatest act of security

774
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,560
in the history of mankind.

775
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,560
Period Barnon.

776
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:41,100
- What's in it for
me, specifically?

777
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,900
- Power.

778
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:46,000
Money.

779
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,100
Your place in history, sir.

780
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,340
You're going to be the
man that cures cancer.

781
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:53,940
I mean, you're going to be
able to write your own check.

782
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:56,140
Do you want to be President?

783
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,410
Do you want your
son to be President?

784
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:59,350
I mean, what do you want?

785
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:02,980
Because of you, no one is ever
gonna have to live in fear.

786
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:06,350
Because of you no one is
going to die of cancer.

787
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:08,060
Because of you no one
is ever gonna have

788
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,820
to fear for their safety again.

789
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:12,160
No one's ever gonna
be scared of crime

790
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,000
or vandalism or assault
or anything such as that.

791
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:18,630
Because of you everyone's
gonna feel safe.

792
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,100
Because of you never
again are parents

793
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:27,780
ever gonna loose a child
and be left wondering why.

794
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:30,610
That will never happen again.

795
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:35,250
Because of you, Senator.

796
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,450
- You're gonna have the
support of the Senate.

797
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:42,020
- Thank you Senator.

798
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:44,460
You just took a vital step
in making this world safe.

799
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:45,830
Thank you.

800
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:46,830
- Thank you.

801
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,200
- Pick up the pace.

802
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,570
- I'm trying.
- Try harder.

803
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:58,570
- Shh.

804
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:00,610
- He's coming.

805
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,320
- Good morning girls.

806
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,330
- How long do you plan
on keeping us here?

807
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:20,390
- Depends.
- On what?

808
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:21,930
- Your cooperation.

809
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:25,030
- You stupid enough to think
you could really control this?

810
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:26,030
- Shut your mouth woman.

811
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:27,430
Before I shut it for you.

812
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:28,900
- You'll ruin everything.

813
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,140
- Certain events
must be set right.

814
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:33,140
- You'll destroy us all.

815
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:35,240
- Time is like a pond.
- What?

816
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,380
- Imagine a stone,
it hits water.

817
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:38,910
It creates a ripple, it's chaos.

818
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:40,280
It changes everything forever.

819
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,780
- But it's only temporary.

820
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:44,450
The body of water will
become calm again.

821
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:45,990
The body of water
is still there.

822
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:47,720
- And so is the stone.

823
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,630
- It's changed forever.
- But it's one small stone.

824
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:53,130
- One small stone that
can kill a young boy

825
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:55,200
and make him slip and
crack his head open

826
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,930
or to kill the savior
of the Venetian.

827
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:59,430
- My children have
suffered too long.

828
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:01,440
What kind of man would
I be to let it continue?

829
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,300
- Your men are like sheep.

830
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,410
- You watch your step with me.

831
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:06,710
You don't understand anything.

832
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:08,940
- Oh, I understand completely.

833
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:11,210
It's like killing a
dictator as a young boy.

834
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:12,780
You don't know if you can
end up with someone worse.

835
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,580
- I've heard these
stories before.

836
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,650
- Yeah, well then why don't
you start listening to them.

837
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:17,650
- Enough.

838
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:26,130
- Don't touch her.

839
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,460
- Is that any way to
speak to your father?

840
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:33,000
Open the cell.

841
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,270
- What are you gonna do?

842
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:35,840
- Take her to my room.

843
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,570
- No, no, no, please.

844
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:45,080
Get out of here.

845
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,510
- Lauren.

846
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:49,950
What is wrong with you?

847
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:52,750
Lauren.
