1
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:13,260
Previously on Dystopia.

2
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,400
- We have to bring them back.

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,600
- No!

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,800
- We have to, they're gonna die.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,300
- They are trapped in 2017.

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,140
- It's people like
you, scientists,

7
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,370
ruined the whole world.

8
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:26,180
- Apparently, a group
of rogue scientists

9
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,480
seemed to have built a
machine of some type.

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,280
People were hooked up to it,

11
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,820
the scientists themselves.

12
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,780
- We have located the source
of temporal disturbance,

13
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,850
but it's a lot more complicated
than we first thought.

14
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:39,290
- See I owe you for all
more than I can ever regret.

15
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,060
- Perhaps we can pull
in a big favor one day.

16
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,860
- Look carefully, my son.

17
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,060
This is our duty.

18
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,670
They're alive,

19
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:53,170
but the connection's
been severed.

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,640
- Stop!

21
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,380
Stop! Stop!

22
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:03,380
Stop!

23
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:09,720
Freeze!

24
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,920
Dispatch, we got a code 6-33.

25
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,830
Suspect is heading north
on Washington Street.

26
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,300
C'mon, let's go.

27
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,610
He's right there!

28
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,310
Stop!

29
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,050
- Hey! Open the door!
- Come here, come here.

30
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:43,250
- C'mon, hurry up, hurry up.

31
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,590
Come on, come on, come on!

32
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,670
- Put your gun down.

33
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:00,500
Put it down. Put it down.

34
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,310
Put it down!

35
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,140
Step away.

36
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:02,970
Step away.

37
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:03,940
Get up! Step away.

38
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,210
Don't try anything stupid.

39
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,610
Don't you try anything stupid.

40
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,750
Put this on.

41
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,050
Come on!

42
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,680
- You're making a big mistake.

43
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,900
- Today, BioCorp made history

44
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,300
by releasing the
cure for cancer.

45
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,810
Available to the entire
world's population

46
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,270
in exchange for their enrollment

47
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,710
in the ID chip program,

48
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:14,540
which allows for increased
population security.

49
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,710
The scheme, supported
by the President,

50
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:20,080
is said to usher in a new era
of world peace and prosperity.

51
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,250
The President stated,

52
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,990
"The future belongs
to our children,

53
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:27,420
"and the steps we take today
resonate throughout time.

54
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,630
"Let us be brave and
head into the unknown."

55
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:31,860
And that's all for tonight.

56
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,300
- And we're clear.

57
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:36,370
- Hi babe.

58
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,440
Hi!

59
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,710
- We need to haul ass quick.

60
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,050
- We can't just leave him here.

61
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:53,150
- There's a platoon
of BioCorp soldiers.

62
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,420
They'll be on us in a heartbeat.

63
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,290
- Can't we protect
them or hold them...

64
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,790
- We gotta go!

65
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,490
It's now or never.

66
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:02,290
Nicholai and Thomas are
alive and well in 2017.

67
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,430
- We gotta go.

68
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,790
We can rebuild everything.

69
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:06,030
- We got to go!

70
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,200
- We're just going
to leave them here?

71
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,030
- Got to.

72
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,230
No other choice.

73
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:10,670
- Where are we gonna go?

74
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,500
Every place has been destroyed.

75
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,440
- I know a place we can go to.

76
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,440
We'll be safe.

77
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,440
- What are we supposed to take?

78
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,610
- Nothing, there's no time.

79
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:20,840
They'll be here any minute.

80
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,780
- All right, come on.

81
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,510
Come on, come on, come on.

82
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,410
- Men, let's go!

83
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,580
- God,

84
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,820
please watch over him.

85
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:02,420
Protect him.

86
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:07,420
Protect him because he is the
only one that can save us.

87
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:18,540
Bring him home to me.

88
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:54,040
- My unfortunate reason
for drinking with you

89
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,070
is because you're
pretty much the last man

90
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,570
I could drink with.

91
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,880
Other than that, other than
the fact that you made this...

92
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,840
- Ouch.
- So, you know,

93
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,850
I kinda have to.

94
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:03,780
Yeah, so...

95
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,780
- It is worse for me, you know.

96
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:05,720
You don't understand.

97
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,180
- Oh, it's worse for you?

98
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,550
- I'm thinking,
I'm having a drink

99
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,620
with the last woman
in the world, but um.

100
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,160
You're Mexican.

101
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,760
- Oh, no you didn't.

102
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,090
Why do you keep saying that?

103
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:17,290
Oh my God!

104
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,530
- You and Nicho
are Mexican, right?

105
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:19,630
- Yeah.
- You just try to hide it.

106
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,660
- You want to get punched?

107
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,530
Do you want me to call Nicho?

108
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:23,830
No? No? Yeah?

109
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,070
- No, I don't.

110
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,970
- You are so stupid.

111
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,310
- I'm out, is what I am.

112
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,740
- Yeah?
- I need some.

113
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,010
- Well, too bad.

114
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,240
- It's mine!

115
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,180
- Yeah, okay, well,
if you want it,

116
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,880
why don't you come get and it?

117
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,320
You want to play a game?

118
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,520
- Sure.

119
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,220
- Chicken.

120
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,730
- Okay.

121
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:52,060
So what are the rules?

122
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,030
- If you want it, you
should come and get it.

123
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:55,870
- Really?

124
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:56,730
- Now you're afraid.

125
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:57,970
- I'm afraid?

126
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,170
- Mhmm.

127
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:01,040
- Was that the look
of being afraid?

128
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,940
- How tough are you?

129
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,970
You're too far away.

130
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:04,970
- Okay.

131
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,380
- Is this a better view?

132
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,550
- I've got a bit
more of an idea.

133
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,780
- Yeah?

134
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,320
Does it look like
I'm afraid now?

135
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,190
- You're still too far away.

136
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,990
- Come on, we have to go!

137
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,820
Let's go!

138
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:21,960
- Okay, I'm coming.

139
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,160
- Lauren, let's go!

140
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,270
- We need the address
of Robert Tinker.

141
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,270
- Who's Robert Tinker and
why do you need his address?

142
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,440
- Stop trying to stall.

143
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,280
Don't do that!

144
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,210
- Hey, listen.

145
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,650
Let me go get the tools, okay?

146
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:42,580
- You got this?
- Yeah, yeah,

147
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,350
the clock's ticking though.

148
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:45,180
Hurry up.

149
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,120
- Hey!

150
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,280
Where you going, British?

151
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,990
- You sure you got this?

152
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,420
- Yeah, I got it, I got it.

153
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,660
- They know our names.

154
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,260
They've seen our faces.

155
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,160
Let's do what we have to do.

156
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,330
- I gotta get Jenny.

157
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:03,870
- She's right there.

158
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:04,870
- I gotta.

159
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,900
Jenny, stall him for
one minute, okay?

160
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,840
- What?

161
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,410
- Just stall him!

162
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:12,080
- We gotta go!

163
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,950
- Lauren, they're coming!

164
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:20,680
- We can't wait for her.

165
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,920
- No, we're not
going without her.

166
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,850
Just give her a minute, okay?

167
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,550
- All right.

168
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,190
Come on, give me
the information.

169
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,660
- All right, all right.

170
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,320
- You said
you were gonna cooperate.

171
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,290
- If I do this,

172
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:30,330
will you let us go?

173
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:31,830
- Yes, yes, yes, just come on.

174
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,460
Get on with it.

175
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,740
- Dispatch, this
is 351 to Central.

176
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,070
Do you copy, over?

177
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,340
- Copy, 351.

178
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,340
They still 10-80?

179
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,770
- Negative.

180
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:46,940
We got a code 7-50.

181
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,410
Need information
on a one Tinker.

182
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,050
First name Robert.

183
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,150
Over.

184
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,520
Copy code 7-50.

185
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,990
351, standby.

186
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,820
I got a Tinker, Robert.

187
00:08:58,820 --> 00:08:59,920
Address, 219 Monopoly Rd,

188
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,730
Western Country, over.

189
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:04,860
- Thanks Central, over and out.

190
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:10,170
- What's the definition
of code 7-50?

191
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,370
Sit down!

192
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:13,070
I swear to God,
I'm gonna shut you.

193
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:14,470
- All right.

194
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:17,270
- What's the definition
of police code 7-50?

195
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,580
- Police code
7-50, officer in duress.

196
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,780
- Officer in duress?

197
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,850
Officer in duress?!

198
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,310
What is this?

199
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,250
- Like I said, we just
wanna go home alive, okay?

200
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,450
- You shouldn't have done that.

201
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,290
- Hey!

202
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:30,220
- You shouldn't have done that!

203
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:30,950
- Take it easy, take it easy!

204
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:31,960
Come on, man!

205
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,120
I'm sorry!

206
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,560
Come on!

207
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,790
Oh my God!

208
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,800
Oh, man.

209
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,500
- So when did it happen?

210
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,710
- Some time today, sir.

211
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,670
- This whole situation's
out of hand already.

212
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,380
- This is important,
Mr. President.

213
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,710
- I don't need you
to remind me of that.

214
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,210
- Yes, sir.

215
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,680
- You tell the Speaker

216
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,520
that he can use
whatever means necessary

217
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,090
to find out who broke
into the apartment

218
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:03,090
and killed this man.

219
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,930
- With all due respect, sir,

220
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:13,860
could you be a little more
specific as to our intent?

221
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:18,500
- When I say, "whatever
means necessary,"

222
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,670
that's exactly what I mean.

223
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:22,010
Whatever means necessary.

224
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,010
You follow?

225
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:25,310
- Yes, sir.

226
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:27,610
With your permission, I'll
tend to it immediately.

227
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:28,880
- Go for it.

228
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,350
- Copy.

229
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,590
- There's only two of them.

230
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:48,720
- Should we go around?

231
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,930
- Give me the gun.

232
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,460
- They can't even see us.

233
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,700
- Now's not the time for
a bleeding heart, Lauren.

234
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,800
Now step back.

235
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,630
- Draw attention...

236
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,340
- I said, step back!

237
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,440
Don't you ever do that again!

238
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,570
If it wasn't for me,
we'd all be dead by now.

239
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,680
- They're human,
just like you and me.

240
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,880
- You either live or die.

241
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,910
It's time to pick a side.

242
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:13,050
This is what we have
to do to survive.

243
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,520
That's the trouble
with people like you.

244
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,590
Never wanna understand anything.

245
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:24,960
Never want blood on your hands.

246
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,500
- Travis, she's
scared, all right?

247
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,000
Like the rest of us.

248
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,830
She's afraid she's gonna
lose everything she loves.

249
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,630
- I already lost
everyone I already loved.

250
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,400
- Well then you
know how she feels.

251
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,730
- It's good to be home.

252
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,270
Good to be home.

253
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,010
- We'll need food as well.

254
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,480
What the hell is
all this, Travis?

255
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,310
And where's your dad?

256
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:17,310
- He didn't make it.

257
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,990
This is what he
wanted us to find.

258
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,520
- Who are they?

259
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,820
- They'll get us what
we need to win this war.

260
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:32,630
- So they're guests.

261
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,260
- Sure.

262
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:42,240
- Just stay on their good
side, whatever you do.

263
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,110
- Are you sure
about what you're telling me?

264
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:45,640
- Quite sure, Mr. President.

265
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,680
- I think the priority is to
find out about this machine.

266
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,880
If it can do anything
close to what you say,

267
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,780
it could alter the
course of history.

268
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,980
- In more ways than one.

269
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,220
- So may I inquire as to whether

270
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:03,430
you had any prior knowledge
of these experiments.

271
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,860
- Of course not, how could I?

272
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:07,700
We need to get together
a bunch of scientists,

273
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,170
the best in the country.

274
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:11,900
The best technicians who know
about this sort of thing.

275
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,840
- Yes, sir.

276
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,770
- Figure out how they built it,

277
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:14,800
what they're gonna do with it.

278
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,810
I need regular updates.

279
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:18,410
You can't talk to
anybody about it.

280
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:19,610
- Yes.

281
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:21,580
- Gotta keep the whole
thing top secret.

282
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,980
- Understood, Mr. President.

283
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,320
Thank you, sir.

284
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,020
- Thank you.

285
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:32,320
And you,

286
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,060
watch that tongue of yours.

287
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,060
- My apologies, sir.

288
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,300
- I just wonder,

289
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,070
is it possible

290
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,330
what happened to Jack

291
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,840
are these same men

292
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:51,340
could be responsible
for what happened?

293
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,610
- Sector
Six Control to BioHawk One.

294
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:58,750
Come in, over.

295
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,020
BioHawk One, receiving.

296
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,220
- BioHawk One,

297
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,390
transport Commander
Dane directly to

298
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:03,750
the coordinates in Sector Nine,

299
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,590
found to contain
temporal disturbance.

300
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:07,560
Commander Rankin's strike
team have come under attack

301
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,860
from suspected rebels.

302
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,060
Other units are in route

303
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,890
and will rendezvous
with you at the target.

304
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:13,730
- Copy that, Control.

305
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,630
Rerouting to target
coordinates, over.

306
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,710
- Check all the rooms.

307
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,260
- What the
hell took so long, huh?

308
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,430
Nicho, Jesus Christ!

309
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:44,090
There's two more people
that know what we look like

310
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:45,260
and they're cops!

311
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,830
- We got bigger
things to worry about.

312
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,030
They used a duress code.

313
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,100
- Did you get the address?

314
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,780
- Yeah, I got it but
I just can't trust it.

315
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,440
They could've gave us a
false one, I don't know.

316
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,240
- They don't need to give
us a false address, do they?

317
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,480
They just give us the real
address but wait outside it

318
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,940
then we'll show up and
they'll arrest us there.

319
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,710
- We gotta be careful.

320
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:04,780
Stay under the radar.

321
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,250
- Yes we do.

322
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,250
- Hey, what're you doing?

323
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,920
- Staying under the radar.

324
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,120
Right?

325
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,060
We can't go to
that house anyway.

326
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:15,020
They'll be waiting for us.

327
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,460
Hiding in plain sight, mate.

328
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:24,330
- Everybody out.

329
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,640
- What did you find, Commander?

330
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,440
- We're too late.

331
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,940
- What have we here?

332
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,880
Which one is he in?

333
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,090
- This one.

334
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:01,370
- That's him.

335
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,310
- I know.

336
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:06,040
- I spoke to him once, briefly.

337
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,310
I thought I would
never see him again.

338
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:13,020
- I wanna get a finger print
scan just to make sure.

339
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,020
- It's him.

340
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:20,460
- This one's got Philip in it.

341
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,930
The last communication
confirms that he successfully

342
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:25,630
teleported himself back to 2017.

343
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:26,630
- Really?

344
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,170
Doesn't seem that
successful to me.

345
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,070
They're all dead.

346
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,070
- The soldiers that were
supposed to go with them

347
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:39,140
were ambushed by
a group of rebels.

348
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,910
- So these machines
can transport a man

349
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:46,910
back in time.

350
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,050
- He must've been
trying to learn all

351
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:54,020
the secrets of the machine
from these two beforehand.

352
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:56,490
- Perhaps another BioCorp
soldier was murdered.

353
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:58,530
Yes, Commander?

354
00:17:58,530 --> 00:17:59,830
- Yes, sir.

355
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:02,170
- Get on it.

356
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:04,530
- Clear the building.

357
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,400
- Commander,

358
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,210
I want a team of our best
scientists, on the double.

359
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:12,340
I want them to
analyze, to cipher

360
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,110
and duplicate these machines

361
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,810
as soon as possible.

362
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:17,210
We have to get them working.

363
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,880
- Yes, sir.

364
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:30,890
- Such power.

365
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,800
Such promise.

366
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,270
The possibilities.

367
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:45,470
- Get down on
the ground right now!

368
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:47,340
Put your face on the ground now!

369
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,810
- You don't have to do this.

370
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:50,050
- Spare us.

371
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:51,850
We have nothing to
do with you people.

372
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,250
- Please, no, you
don't have to do this.

373
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,520
- Darling, look at me.

374
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:01,790
Look into my eyes.

375
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,790
It's okay.

376
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:04,890
We're together.

377
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,530
You'll always be my daughter.

378
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:12,170
- Kill 'em.

379
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:15,670
Leave no survivors.

380
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:16,840
- No, no, no, please don't!

381
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,550
- This elevator is
nicer than our apartment.

382
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,090
- It's true.

383
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,660
At least we had
to live like this.

384
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,660
- It's clean.

385
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,490
- Smells good.

386
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:39,900
- Jenny would love this, right?

387
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,230
- Yeah, Jenny would love this.

388
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:47,700
- You ever think about that?

389
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,700
You know,

390
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:53,210
just moving here?

391
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:54,910
Starting again,
making a new life.

392
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:57,180
People have so much here.

393
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:00,820
Kill ourselves for
what they throw away.

394
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:04,790
- Yeah.

395
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,590
Where would we go though?

396
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:10,490
- Anywhere.

397
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:13,000
- Just forget about this life?

398
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:16,060
Pretend the future
never happens.

399
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,000
- No.

400
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I know it happens.

401
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,770
Maybe nothing can
stop it happening

402
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:23,310
but we could be like
better prepared.

403
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,310
Better placed.

404
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:27,410
Hey, we'd be rich if we stayed.

405
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:28,440
You think about that?

406
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,080
- We could go to South Africa.

407
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,850
- Now you're talking.

408
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:40,590
Couldn't get there for
love or money in our time.

409
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,590
- No.

410
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,030
But I got a good memory.

411
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,100
- Me too.

412
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,170
- There's two names that
would always ring on my brain.

413
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:57,170
- Yeah.

414
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:00,810
Yeah.

415
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,050
Well, what do you say?

416
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:11,490
We make a break for it?

417
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:12,520
- Go to Mexico?

418
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,420
- Oh.

419
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,960
No.

420
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:17,860
Robert Tinker.

421
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,330
We've got a job to do, right?

422
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:23,330
- I'm game if you are.

423
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,280
- Everything just feels
so impossible now.

424
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,920
- What's impossible?

425
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:46,220
- I know we couldn't
have stayed but

426
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,730
I just feel awful
leaving him there.

427
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:50,730
- That,

428
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,360
that was just a shell.

429
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,860
That wasn't Nicho anymore.

430
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:57,070
- Well it looked
like Nicho to me.

431
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,630
- Don't do this to
yourself, all right?

432
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:01,300
Your torturing yourself and
it's not gonna help anybody.

433
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,840
- I can only imagine what
they're doing to them.

434
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,310
- We're gonna get them
back, Jenny, I promise you.

435
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:06,240
- Probably treating
them like lab rats.

436
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,880
- Listen to me,
Nicho's body and soul

437
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,050
are alive and well in 2017.

438
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:13,550
I saw it with my own eyes.

439
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:15,780
- Yeah, you saw it, it's
easy for you to say.

440
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,420
I didn't even get
to say goodbye.

441
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,930
When we first met,

442
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:27,530
he told me that I would be
the one to have his children.

443
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:32,940
It was like one of
the very first things

444
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,140
that he ever said to me.

445
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:38,740
It's crazy, isn't it?

446
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:40,640
- Pick out any names?

447
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,450
- It's just not fair.

448
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,350
- It's why he's back
there, you know?

449
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:53,760
To fix all this so
you can pick names.

450
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,760
- And if he dies?

451
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:57,230
- You gotta see this.

452
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,900
- Come on.

453
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,200
- We found this.

454
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,140
- Hey guys.

455
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:15,740
Jenny,

456
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:18,280
We're alive.

457
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,520
The connection is severed.

458
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,650
- Where did you get this?

459
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:21,720
- We found it in his dad's place

460
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,320
with today's date written on it.

461
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,950
We think we left it for us.

462
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:26,960
- We're in short
supply here in 2017.

463
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,060
Now, guys, this
safe box contains

464
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,430
blueprints to the
machine design.

465
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:32,860
It's everything you'll need.

466
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,260
Now listen carefully.

467
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,130
The safe box has an
acidic substance,

468
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:38,830
so if it's forced open,
the vile will break

469
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:40,340
and data will be lost.

470
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,770
Jenny, this is for you.

471
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,410
Only you know where the key is.

472
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:50,550
I love you.

473
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:53,250
I can only trust you.

474
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,280
- This is it.

475
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,090
- There's no more
of the message?

476
00:23:58,090 --> 00:23:59,050
- No.

477
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:00,860
- No, that's all we ever got.

478
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,460
Where is this key?

479
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,290
- I have no idea.

480
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:05,790
- You must know
something about it!

481
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:07,730
Otherwise, why would he
mention it in the first place?

482
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:09,000
- I don't have a key!

483
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,200
- She's not hiding
anything from you.

484
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,700
- I'm not accusing
her of treason, David,

485
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,900
but if you know something
that you're not telling us.

486
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,700
- If I knew anything,
I would tell you.

487
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,700
- Fine!

488
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,910
There's a combination
lock here too.

489
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:21,910
So I want you to write
down any and all numbers

490
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:23,710
significant to you and Nicholai.

491
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,310
Birthdays, anniversaries,

492
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:27,620
the day you met, when
you fell in love,

493
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,720
the first time you
screwed, everything

494
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,050
and start doing it now!

495
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:34,320
- What're you gonna do with it?

496
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,530
- We can send a team back
to help Nicholai and Thomas

497
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:39,760
finish what they started.

498
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,660
- How do you
know it's gonna work?

499
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,600
- Because all of
you are gonna help

500
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,870
in every step of the way.

501
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,970
Not only will we have the
power to save humanity,

502
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:51,570
but we a alter it for
the good of all of us.

503
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:54,580
We can defeat BioCorp
before it's ever born.

504
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,510
- Yeah!

505
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:56,310
- Are you with me?!

506
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,110
- Yeah!

507
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:57,950
- Are you with me?!

508
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:58,980
- Yeah!

509
00:24:58,980 --> 00:24:59,980
- Yeah!

510
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:04,750
Jenny, not is the time to act.

511
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,950
To help save humanity.

512
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,290
Will you do it?

513
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:10,790
- Yeah, I'll help you.

514
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,530
I'll do whatever it takes.

515
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:14,530
- Good, Jenny.

516
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,030
You're doing the right thing.

517
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:42,190
- I can't see you but
I know you're there.

518
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:47,130
- I never left you.

519
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:48,130
I'm always with you.

520
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:53,100
Baby, you need to
leave this place.

521
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,770
You're not safe.

522
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:28,500
- Oh my God, there's
a cop, there's a cop.

523
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:32,470
No, no, no, no.

524
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,280
Look, killing people
isn't always the answer.

525
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,120
- This time.

526
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,450
Nicho,

527
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:43,920
it's not the answer this time.

528
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:47,720
They're not going away.

529
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:52,730
Come on.

530
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:59,770
- David, we have a problem.

531
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:00,770
- Yeah, I'm ahead of you there.

532
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:02,710
He's a tad aggressive.

533
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:03,840
But we've got a common goal.

534
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,340
That should protect us for now.

535
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,880
- What happens when we
don't have a common goal?

536
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,980
- We still need to find a
place to rebuild the machine.

537
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,580
- Wait.

538
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,880
Are you planning to escape?

539
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,350
- There's way to many
people around here.

540
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:15,380
We couldn't slop off.

541
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:22,890
So how is it you still have
so many of those things?

542
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:25,430
- I bought them in bulk
when the economy went down.

543
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,860
- You know, they're still
not exactly good for you.

544
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,730
- Yeah,

545
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:31,000
well you know what?

546
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I promise I will quit as
soon as I get pregnant.

547
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,970
- Do not make those
jokes around Jenny.

548
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:41,510
- May I?

549
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:44,750
- Sure.

550
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,550
- You know, it's
been a long time

551
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:52,820
since I've seen
a beautiful lady.

552
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,720
Very long time.

553
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:01,460
You got a guy at all?

554
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,100
- I sure do.

555
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:08,000
- Lucky guy.

556
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,670
- Isn't he just?

557
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,370
- We didn't have an
appointment proper

558
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:17,210
but I'm so glad
you could join us.

559
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,880
- Robert Tinker.

560
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:24,610
What's up, buddy?

561
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:29,150
We know everything about you.

562
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:30,150
Every employee,

563
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:32,250
every friend,

564
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:38,430
every family member in history.

565
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,960
We know so much about you.

566
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,800
We could strike at any time,

567
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:47,170
any place,

568
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,400
anywhere.

569
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:53,910
- It doesn't have to be
like that though, Robert.

570
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:54,910
You can save them.

571
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:56,980
All of them.

572
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:00,220
- Just tell me what
it is you guys want.

573
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:04,190
- Abandon your ID chip
program research immediately.

574
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:06,920
- What chip ID project research?

575
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,220
- Don't do that, we
know you're working on it.

576
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,660
- No, I am not
working on anything.

577
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:12,430
- If you lie to us, Robert,
your family will die.

578
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:13,430
- Listen to me.

579
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:15,160
- Do you want...
- Listen to me!

580
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,170
We work on all
kinds of projects,

581
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:18,870
all the time, simultaneously,

582
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:19,870
one after the other!

583
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:21,370
All the time!

584
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:25,340
None of them have anything to
do with some sort of a chip.

585
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:27,080
I swear to God I have no idea

586
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,680
what you guys are talking about.

587
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,450
- Then you haven't
created it yet.

588
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:35,980
- Created what?

589
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:38,120
What's this thing
supposed to do?

590
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,120
- Show him.

591
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:42,390
- You see this?

592
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,530
This is what they did to me.

593
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:47,590
Everyone.

594
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,100
- I've never seen anything
like that in my life.

595
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,640
I mean,

596
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,600
that almost looks
like it's from...

597
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,070
- The future.

598
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,140
- That's because it is

599
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,240
and so are we.

600
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:08,950
- Oh my God.

601
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,690
Oh my God, time travel?

602
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:11,890
- Correct.

603
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:12,720
- How?

604
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,660
How does it work?

605
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,890
I mean, tell me how it works.

606
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:17,530
- No, we're not
here for that today.

607
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:20,400
- But if you guys are
here then there has to be,

608
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,660
I don't know, some
sort of problem

609
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,000
with my future or
something, right?

610
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,900
- This chip was
manufactured by your company

611
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,040
and surgically
implanted into every

612
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,110
man,

613
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,370
woman

614
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:32,370
and child

615
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,840
causing infertility
to the whole race.

616
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,810
- The whole race, as in
the whole human race?

617
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:41,180
- Yeah.

618
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,050
- Everywhere?

619
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:43,450
Even like Britain and...

620
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,990
- There are no countries
where we're from, Robert.

621
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:50,330
Your company made that happen.

622
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:54,230
The world is a very
different place.

623
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:55,500
- My corporation...

624
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,700
- Yeah, your corporation.

625
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,900
You sold your corporation

626
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,810
to the government for billions
of dollars, you know why?

627
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:05,710
They wanted to track
every human being

628
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:07,710
and your chip,

629
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:11,280
your chip was the solution.

630
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,220
- Where we're from, Robert,

631
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:15,020
you're a very hated man.

632
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,520
Very hated but very rich.

633
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,150
- You see, I would never be
apart of a project like that.

634
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:20,960
I got into this
deal to help people.

635
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,390
- That's what everybody
says before billions

636
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:25,230
roll into their account!

637
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:27,130
And all of a sudden
your conscience gets,

638
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:28,200
poof, into the wind.

639
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,240
- You know the
humiliating part of this?

640
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,200
Huh? Huh?

641
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,200
Do you know?

642
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,340
You.

643
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:40,980
You get murdered and they
take over your company

644
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,350
and in a few years time,

645
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:48,550
there is no one
left alive on Earth

646
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,550
because of Robert Tinker.

647
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,120
- If it isn't you, Robert,

648
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,260
then it's somebody who
works for your company.

649
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:04,330
- So do you know what
needs to happen now?

650
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:05,970
- I can find out.

651
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:07,170
I swear to you guys,

652
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:09,440
I have no idea what
you're talking about but

653
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,870
I allow a lot of my engineers,
my best and brightest,

654
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:14,040
to exercise their
brilliant creativity.

655
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,680
I allow them to work
on different projects.

656
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,150
My director of special programs,
he oversees everything.

657
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:21,750
He will know exactly what is
going on, I will ask him...

658
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,420
- What's his name?

659
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,420
- Brandon.

660
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,090
- Brandon what?

661
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:27,090
- Davidson.

662
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,620
Brandon takes care
of everything.

663
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,860
And Brandon will know.

664
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:33,200
He'll know exactly
who's doing what

665
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,700
and I will find out,
I will shut it down.

666
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,100
I'll forbade it
within my company.

667
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,230
I will fire the individual.

668
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:40,170
I can stop this.

669
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:41,340
I can stop this from happening.

670
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,640
To that, you have to believe me.

671
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,070
I swear to you I can do this.

672
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:49,480
- You think he's
telling the truth?

673
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,680
- I think if he's lying,

674
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,680
we'll see him again.

675
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:54,980
You understand that?

676
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,220
- I do.

677
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,620
I do.

678
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:04,530
- Otherwise,

679
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:06,030
we're gonna have to erase you.

680
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:08,330
From history.

681
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:12,930
- I understand that.

682
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:15,500
I understand, I got it.

683
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,800
I got it.

684
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,340
- Tell you the truth, Robert.

685
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:21,040
Nobody in this room ever
wants to see you again.

686
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:21,880
Ever.

687
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,880
- You won't.

688
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:25,610
- Because if we do,

689
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:29,320
there's only one
other way to do this.

690
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:32,090
- No, no, no, wait, wait,
wait, for God sakes!

691
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:33,020
I don't know!

692
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,460
I don't want to be an evil man!

693
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:36,590
I never wanted to do
anything to hurt anybody!

694
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:40,030
I wanted to help people!

695
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:41,960
If they're gonna kill me
anyway, why would I do it?

696
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,330
Why would I take the money
if they're gonna kill me?

697
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,040
- Let's go.

698
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:05,190
Don't worry, buddy.

699
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:07,890
Call the cops to untie
you when we're clear.

700
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,400
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

701
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,440
The time travel, I
really gotta know.

702
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:27,370
How's it work?

703
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:30,310
- No.

704
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:43,730
- Thank you, God.

705
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:56,200
- Here's everything I know.

706
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,410
- You certain it's everything?

707
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:58,940
- I'm positive.

708
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:02,410
There's a few things that are
personal, outside of the wall.

709
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,110
- There's nothing
beyond the wall.

710
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:09,880
Oh, and I wanna apologize
to you for my behavior.

711
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,490
- Travis, it's fine.

712
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:12,890
I know, your father and all.

713
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:15,090
- Thanks, Jenny.

714
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,870
- I don't know about you

715
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:26,630
but I am exhausted
from all the running.

716
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:27,900
- All exhausted.

717
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,340
We've been running
away for two days.

718
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:32,610
- Hey.

719
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:33,610
Come closer.

720
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,810
- What for?

721
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:37,380
- Just come closer, I don't
want anyone to overhear.

722
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,750
- What?

723
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:40,620
- I know the combination.

724
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:42,980
- You do?

725
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,190
- I didn't give it to them.

726
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:47,890
- Buying time?

727
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:49,320
- I'm just running.

728
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:54,100
- Hey, think you
could do us a favor?

729
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,600
Find us something to eat?

730
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,600
- Please, we haven't ate
or drank anything all day.

731
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:00,540
- Let me see what I can do.

732
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,670
How would you like
your steak cooked?

733
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,270
- However.

734
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:05,870
Appreciate it.

735
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:06,870
- Hey,

736
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,350
Nicho told me to always
trust my instincts.

737
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:11,680
- Your secret's safe with me.

738
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,110
Whatever is eating at Travis

739
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:14,780
is gonna drive him to the
wrong decision sooner or later.

740
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,080
- What makes you say that?

741
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:19,550
- Because the ends
justify the means.

742
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:21,390
That's how he operates.

743
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:24,390
- Temptation will
be too much for him.

744
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:26,430
- So, what do we do?

745
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,260
- Nicho's over there
fighting for us.

746
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,500
We have to do whatever
we can to protect them.

747
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,840
We can't let those
thugs back there.

748
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,270
The design on the
machine dies with us.

749
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:39,140
- Okay.

750
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,680
- No, I'm serious.

751
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,710
Not your life, not my
life, not Lauren's.

752
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:44,310
No one's is more important

753
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:46,780
than what those guys
are trying to do.

754
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,420
- All right.

755
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,420
I'm with you.

756
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,420
Whatever that means.

757
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:56,920
- Do you know how to
rebuild the machine

758
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,030
without whatever's in that safe?

759
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,630
- I could start it, I
couldn't complete it.

760
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:02,800
I need Nicho or Thomas
to fill in the gaps.

761
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,030
- No, if we can't do
it, then no one can.

762
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,740
- We probably shouldn't
stay here too long.

763
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:10,870
If you just have them

764
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:13,070
a bunch of combinations
that won't work.

765
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:14,040
- Right.

766
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,540
All right.

767
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,540
Quiet exit.

768
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:19,750
While they're all asleep.

769
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,050
- I'll tell Lauren.

770
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:52,410
- I'm sorry.

771
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,750
I just dropped by to
apologize for my behavior.

772
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,420
It was wrong of me.

773
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,620
- You don't say.

774
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,090
- I don't mean to be so abrupt.

775
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:03,690
I'm just so passionate at times,

776
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:06,190
it ends out coming
out wrong at times.

777
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:09,430
- Look,

778
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:11,630
today was a rough day.

779
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:14,170
You lost your father.

780
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:19,170
Nicho always said, things seem
better in the morning, so,

781
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:21,080
why don't you get
yourself some sleep?

782
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:24,510
- I'll have my men get
you something to eat.

783
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:26,580
- That'd be nice.

784
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,460
- Have a shot.

785
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,460
- I'm fine.

786
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:39,490
- Trust me, Lauren,

787
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:41,860
you need this more than ever.

788
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:54,810
- I hope your
father's proud of you.

789
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,180
So,

790
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:07,720
how's that combination
coming along?

791
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:10,220
- Nothing yet but
we'll figure it out.

792
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:26,110
My men are putting together
every possible combination

793
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:28,180
and testing them out right now.

794
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:31,110
- Good.

795
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,020
- What can I do for you?

796
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:39,150
- Just checking to see if
Lauren was good for the night.

797
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:40,450
You guys need anything
to eat or drink?

798
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:42,120
- She's got a drink
here, with me.

799
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,230
You get yourself to bed.

800
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:46,390
There's a good boy.

801
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:48,730
- Lauren?

802
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:49,730
- I'm fine.

803
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:51,970
I'll see you in the morning.

804
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,500
- Something else?

805
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,400
- Have a goodnight.

806
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,880
- That was rude, right?

807
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,580
Can't he see that I'm trying
to chat with a gorgeous girl?

808
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:06,810
- At least he's trying
to look out for me,

809
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:08,950
like my brother
Nicho asked him to.

810
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:12,020
- You all in love with David?

811
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:14,050
- No.

812
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,530
- Were you ever in love?

813
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:20,060
- Yes.

814
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,160
- Who's the lucky guy?

815
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:25,600
You don't talk a lot.

816
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,470
I hope you talk to him.

817
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:29,470
- When I can.

818
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,740
- Did you tell
him you loved him?

819
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:34,710
- Yes.

820
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:39,650
I'm just not sure
if he heard me.

821
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:45,220
Jenny, stall them
for one minute, okay?

822
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:47,220
Just stall them!

823
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:51,360
- We gotta go!

824
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,260
- I love you.

825
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:47,550
- Damn shame, ain't it?

826
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:48,550
- Yeah.

827
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,550
- There's nothing
lucky about being dead.

828
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:53,820
Thomas, right?

829
00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:08,740
- How long do
you think it'll take you

830
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:10,540
to figure out how
these things work?

831
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:12,870
- Give it three hours and
we'll have a test to fix it.

832
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:17,710
- Good.

833
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:19,810
We're ready to commence
animal trial, sir.

834
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:22,850
- We don't have time for that.

835
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,150
- You don't want tests?

836
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:26,590
- Not with animals.

837
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:29,860
- Might not be safe, sir.

838
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:31,730
These are like microwaves.

839
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:32,730
- This microwave

840
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:35,730
will save our future.

841
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,100
Sacrificing these soldiers
for BioCorp trumps safety.

842
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:41,600
These are true heroes.

843
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,470
- Sir, we don't even know
how the machines work.

844
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:48,210
- Time waits for no man.

845
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:49,380
Get in, get dirty.

846
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:51,950
This is the only
way to understand

847
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:53,980
this marvelous gift
we've been given.

848
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:57,950
- I'll start drafting
volunteers immediately.

849
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:18,040
We have an opportunity
to do a great service

850
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,780
for the company, the
world and all of mankind

851
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:23,610
but I need volunteers.

852
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:26,410
Your mission

853
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:30,220
will be to hunt down
by any means necessary

854
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:32,050
the two men

855
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:33,720
and the two women

856
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:35,720
who are not only traders

857
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,690
but threaten our very existence.

858
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:42,500
Bring them to me.
