00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,390
Maybe we need to talk about that too.
VIC: It's all privileged.

322
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,353
She has to know
how best to protect us.

323
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:51,189
Vendrell. Why don't you
come on up here,
spin the wheel?

324
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,753
Bring Becca.
I don't want her.

325
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,436
Hey, we can't take
any chances. Trust me.

326
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,392

[PEOPLE MOANING ON TV]

328
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,513
Get on the ground right now.
Get down! Get on the ground!
Don't move!

329
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,676
LEM:
Hands up. Hands up.

330
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,711
Sorry to crash the party, fellas.

331
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,036
VIC: Which one of you is Ted Shusett?
BILLY: He ain't here.

332
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,754
Who are you?
Billy Boyd. That's my brother, Jimmy.

333
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,279
You know where he is?

334
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,597
He comes by at night to crash
lately. I don't know what
he does in the sunlight.

335
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,509
He kills people. Like his ex-girlfriend
and his kid, for example.

336
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,588
Here. You hear from him,
you call that number.

337
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:37,271
You don't, I'll have you
both arrested for conspiracy
in their murders.

338
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,799
You must be doing okay.

339
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,117
You bought a $600,000 house
in Atwater six months ago.

340
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,754
How do you like the area?
We don't live there.

341
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,032
That's right.
Contractor said you gutted it.

342
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,596
Everything new from the ground up.
Do you have a question, lieutenant?

343
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,268
Actually, you pay as you go?

344
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,994
He gives your wife the bills

Everything is accounted for.
You wanna see them?

347
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,235
Already have. I've seen everything.

348

As IAD, you're only entitled

Doing anything to make extra cash?
Don't answer that. We're done.

356

Next time, you submit
your questions in writing
to my office.

357
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,350
I just wanna know where
you get the extra money from.

358
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,118
Come on, Vendrell.

359
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,311
Now she's defending me
like we're guilty.

360
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,670
Why don't you just put it up
in big, flashing neon lights?

361
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,155
I'm not the one
with bags of cash
floating around.

362
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,158
And excuse me if I step
on his questions
to help keep you out of jail.

363
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,511
This is about more than that.
It's about keeping our jobs.

364
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,030
It's about walking out
of here with our pensions,
our reputations.

365
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,993
Keeping us out of jail
is just one piece
of the puzzle.

366
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,556
Until Kavanaugh
charges somebody,
we just have to deflect.

367
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,955
Hope he reveals more than he should.
SHANE: Not me.

368
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,390
I'm sorry, darling,
but you don't
represent me anymore.

369
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,989
Can you give us a moment, please?
Yeah.

370
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,757
All right,
what the hell
happened up there?

371
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,712
SHANE:
He's looking into my records.

372
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,992
What me and Mara
bring home, what we're
paying for the house.

373
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,270
I thought that was covered.
It is. To the penny.

374
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,948
Problem is, there's nothing
left over, and he knows it.

375
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,718
This isn't good.
No shit.

376
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,911
All right, all right,
let's just take a deep breath.

377
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,997
While we're still
breathing free air.

378
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,476
Vic, we got a shots-fired call
from the address you guys just left.

379
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,752
All right.
Lemansky. I need to see you for a sec.

380
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,518
VIC: What happened?
ASHER: Some kind of shootout.

381
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,792
Dead guy inside
is this guy's brother.

382
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,319
VIC:
Who killed Jimmy?
Was it Shusett?

383
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,636
No, saw them coming up the stairs.

384
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,751
Knew some major stuff
was gonna go down.

385
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,959
So I went and got my gun.

386
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,879
By the time I found it,
Jimmy was all shot up.

387
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,116
RONNIE:
Did you see who killed him?

388
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,629
Some cholo dude.

389
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,671
Rolls with Ochoa.

390
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,233
Guess Ochoa was a little more
broken up than we thought
about his dead lady.

391
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,989
Or he wanted his drugs back.
He killed my brother, man.

392
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:23,030
My street intel says
someone's trying to unload
weight. Mexican meth.

393
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,196
Shusett didn't go to Ochoa's
to kill his ex-crank-skank.

394
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,632
He went to steal
his drugs. Those things
flood the barrio, forget it.

395
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,879
RONNIE: So let's find them first.
Better yet, let's buy them.

396
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,550
Who do we know
who could buy from Shusett
without raising flags?

397
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,150
I got a dealer. Street name's Burnout.
I think he got popped with
Shusett once for possession.

398
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,231
VIC: All right.
REYES: I'll check in with my guys.

399
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,715
Let me know if you find him.
VIC: Great.

400
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,315
My quota's a little low this week.

401
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,556
Who wants to do the bracelet dance?
Back up, Burnout.

402
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,558
We need you to buy some drugs
from your friend Ted Shusett.

403
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,079
You guys got popped
together once.

404
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,191
Once a fellow fiend,
always a fellow fiend.

405
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,231
Partying together don't make us tight.
SHANE: Call him, all right?

406
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,919
Tell him you're looking
for product. He'll listen.

407
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,792
Do I look like
a stupid nigger to you?

408
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,230
Why do you think we're talking?
Man, this is legit.

409
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,989
When he stole his drugs,
Shusett killed a 2-year-old girl
and her mother.

410
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,031
So?
Tried to do it the easy way.

411
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,878
Okay, hold up, hold up, man.

412
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,071
Look, a call like that,
little girl dead, man,

413
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,396
streets gonna know
I'm the one giving it up.

414
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,079
That's pretty rough
on my reputation.

415
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,795
What's the going rate
for a reputation these days?

416
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,153
Twenty-five grand.

417
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,394
Get him out of here.

418
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,149
That's too much for
the department to authorise
on less than 24 hours notice.

419
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,113
City council could
rubber-stamp a reward, though.

420
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,798
See you guys inside, all right?
See you inside.

421
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:51,314
Councilman, glad
I could catch you.
You got a minute?

422
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,748
I have a speech to give.

423
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,838
Yeah, this is really important
for the investigation.

424
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,953
You ever heard of a guy
named Antwon Mitchell?

425
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,997
You know I have.

426
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,358
Talked to Lemansky.

427
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,437
I don't wanna push
on Antwon Mitchell

428
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,949
until I heard what
you got to say about it.

429
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,720
I don't know
what I can tell you.

430
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,118
How did Mackey learn that Crowley
was working with Justice?

431
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,278
What's this have to do with Mitchell?
Humour me.

432
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,589
Well, I suspected it was Gilroy.
Maybe it was you.

433
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,714
You set up Crowley.

434
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,152
You tipped Mackey.
Right, I'm also the fifth Beatle.

435
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:35,434
Mrs. Mackey reported that
he gave her 65 grand in cash.

436
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,914
What was your share?

437
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,832
Running a political campaign
gets really expensive.

438
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,600
So is my time. And now
you're wasting it.

439
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,552
I'm just trying to figure out
how Antwon Mitchell

440
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,230
and a guy named Juan Lozano
figure into all of this.

441
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,750
Lozano was the guy.
Wasn't that the kid
who assaulted you?

442
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,598
Yes.

443
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,274
Yes.
He grabbed your gun?

444
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:04,998
You killed his buddy
during a robbery. Tracked
Lozano down yourself.

445
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,476
I mean, that's a pretty
impressive bust
for a desk jockey.

446
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,955
Then, later,
you visited him in county.

447
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,914
Yeah, well, he was planning
to appeal his case.

448
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,954
I know that Mackey
and his guys
have some connection

449
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,755
with Antwon Mitchell,
and he was in
the same cellblock

450
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,829
when Lozano was found dead.
Something big going on here.

451
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:32,238
You, Mackey, Mitchell, Lozano.

452
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,510
You wanna fill me in?

453
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,631
Waste your time with
these conspiracy theories

454
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,957
and you'll find yourself
even more lost
than you are now.

455
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,038
JULIEN [OVER RADIO]:
Clerk said it was a black woman
who used the credit card.

456
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,077
JULIEN:
He wasn't sure
if it was Fatima Gardner.

457
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,555
J. J: Is anybody listening to me?
JULIEN: We've got a motel address...

458
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,239
What? Say... Say again.

459
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,237
J. J:
I said, Terry's the guy
you're looking for.

460
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,158
I'm not talking to you.
Say again, Julien.

461
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,148
JULIEN: I said, we've got
a motel address where the woman
wanted the purchases delivered.

462
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,430
We're headed there now.

463
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,868
Okay, good.
Copy.

464
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,992
You gotta find Terry,
he's the one who needs
to be in here.

465
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,236
Shut up.

466
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,192
It's pretty sloppy work
you did last night,
killing that girl.

467
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,755
Not your usual
work of art.

468
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,394
Why'd you cut off her hair?
Why'd you cut off yours?

469
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,036
Don't interrupt.
My questions, not yours.

470
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,232
You used to look a lot different.

471
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,998
How long you been sick?

472
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,357
You're the one
who's sick, Kleavon.

473
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,677
Please, girl, you're wobbling
more than a squirrel
fell from a tree.

474
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:44,112
You may act like everything's
all right, but your needle's
going back and forth.

475
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:49,952
Yeah. I hear your bones
creaking every time
you get out that chair.

476
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,319
MAN:
Get in there.

477
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,669
Hey, what am I doing here?

478
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,553
One of the victims
ID'd the guy
you sent to kill Shusett,

479
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,795

00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,673
you had the right to kill?

You didn't respect them,
you didn't even
see them as people.

No, Dutch, he's not.

His grief over
his sister's death
is fuelling his rage.

649
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,876
It's just one more push.

Well, you have to do it.
There's no evidence.

You've accessed
this guy better than
anyone else ever has.

That's why it has
to be you, now.
You're so close.

I can't. Look at me.

You accused me of letting

Well, now you're letting it.

how tired or weak
or pained you are.

he's gonna come after Fatima

or you or some other woman.

So you get back in there
and you close him.

664
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:18,356
As your lawyer,
it's a mistake
and a big one.

But you know
I have to do it.

You can't change the past,
and it only makes
the present harder.

I can't get a fresh start
unless I know she has one.

It's dangerous.
It makes amends.

I want you to get a lawyer.

Make a deal that
gets you clear
with Kavanaugh.

he gets you

some overtime
to cover the expenses.

Why are we having
this conversation without Vic?

to his lawyer more than
he's listening to us.
