until you're ready.

830
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:40,993
You don't put him in there.

Clean out one of the other cages.
KAVANAUGH: He's going there.

Right now. Let's go.

Officer, come over here.

834
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,990
Uncuff him, stick him in the cage.

Let's go.

[DOOR BANGS]

841
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:42,031
You woke me up
out of my beauty sleep, man.

KAVANAUGH:
Yeah, I can see that.

843

I need you to tell me everything.

Everything that you know
about Mackey and the Strike Team.

847
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:02,600
Like I told you before.
No deal, no info.

848
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,031
Get me back to my cell.
You got your deal.

849
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,511
As long as you give me
what it is I need to know.
