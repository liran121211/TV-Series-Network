Hey, kids ready? I might
have to drop them back off early.

176
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,314
My money's been frozen.
What?

177
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,909
Checking, savings, debit cards.
I can't even buy groceries.

178
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,192
Shit, I'm sorry. I just need some time...
I can't.

179
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,709
I can't be around you,
and neither can the kids.

180
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,751
It's not me, it's the lawyer.

181
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,157
I was the one who told you
to hire the asshole, remember?
To protect you.

182
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,512
In order to do that I have to create a
pattern of distancing myself from you.

183
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,312
Listen, it's only temporary,
until you sort these legal matters out.

184
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,954

At least let me give you some cash...
No, Vic. Vic, I can't. I'm sorry.

00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,039
Look, we're gonna sort this all out.

something else out, okay?

190

If you need me, I'll be at work.

191
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,917
Hey, captain?
Captain, this is Detective Hoffman.

192
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,509
He had an incident
with Officer Hanlon last night.

193
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,154
You got an office where I can bitch,
in private?

194
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,828
I like hanging with my cops.
We can talk here.

195
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,190

as undercover officer.

the colour of the day.

to ensure this doesn't happen again.

don't have to get your suits dirty.

I get enough guns to my head
without Barbie adding to the action.

00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,588
You expect me to fire her?

204
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,149
Look, I've tried with Tina, sir.
So has Julien.

205
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,351
She doesn't get it, she never will.
Till it's too late.

206
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,913
Look, she's a woman, Latina besides.

00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,270
There's like three hoops
to jump through to can her.

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,950
Well, you know what,
she's gonna land herself
or someone else in a body bag.

Look, your girl saw this colour,
not the colour on my arm.

juicy I could sink my teeth into.

some new chicken pot pies
in the Quick-Mealer.

over on Clinton?

still set up on him?

Well, he cut a deal. We got two to six.

waiting to meet you

To keep your boy, Curtis, alive.

or you're gonna get matching
his and hers cells.

Your cop buddy's
headed for Lompoc.

238
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,155
Gonna be in the same cell block
with Antwon real soon.

239
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,079
Horseshit.
Ask the other cop, the big brother.

240
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,589
He made the deal with Antwon.
Kavanaugh?

241
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,549
Even a douchebag like Kavanaugh
wouldn't jump into bed
with Antwon Mitchell.

God knows what kind of diseases
you'd get.

243
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,031
Ask him, but do it quick.
Antwon don't like waiting.

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,357
Said make sure you know
offer of protection
ain't out there for long.

in that fat head of his myself

before I'll let him kill another cop.
Tell him yourself.

Sounds like it's a matter of time
before you follow your boy inside.

Get the hell out of here.
Get your hands off.

to make it worse on your boy.

Uh..."Body organs"?

272
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,396
You know, they take them
just before you die,

273
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,352
give them to people
who need them.

274
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:17,030
You mean donor organs?
I guess they have a big need up north.

You can ask his buddy, DeKnight.
He helps him load up sometimes.

was working for Justice...

From the noose tightening?

291
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,951
You send Lem to Lompoc,
it's you that's the real murderer.

292
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,789
The four of you come completely
clean, I will let you pick the prison.

No deal?

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,710
Well, I guess you're not as concerned
for his safety as you claim.

295
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:38,079
Anyway, there's nothing on paper
as to where Lemansky will end up,

296
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,914
but I'm sure
I'll have a recommendation
when the time comes.

297
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,075
That being said,

298
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,953
any correctional facility
is dangerous for a cop.

299
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:49,836
Best thing to do is play by the rules
and stay out of jail.

300
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,158
Streets can be real dangerous too.

301
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,278
Are we levelling threats, detective?

302
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,632
Just making random observations.
Same as you.

303
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,796
Here's another one:

304
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,631
You're bluffing, trying to split us up.

305
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,598
You're Mr. Straight-Arrow, right?

306
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,756
Couldn't even cut your poor,
sick-in-the-head, defenceless ex-wife

307
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,316
a break from the rules, could you?

308
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,752
You don't have the stomach
to serve Lem up to Antwon.

309
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,271
I didn't used to.

310
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,958

I worked with Artemis at the plant.

That donor thing was something
he got on his own.

00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,910
Don't know much about it.
Seems weird.

314
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,588
Usually organs
have to be transplanted
within hours.

315
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,995
It takes a hell of a lot longer
to drive to Canada.

316
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,556
Wouldn't you think they'd fly them?
Maybe it's low-priority organs,

317
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,478
like fingers or tongues.

318
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,439
I'm gonna go out on a limb here.

319
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,790
Artemis was not running
fingers and tongues,

320
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,070
back and forth
to Vancouver, was he?

321
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,635
Whatever he was running
got him shot in the face.

322
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,835
Shit, he's dead?

323
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,474

some sort of super-weed.

You get near this shit, the contact
high'd knock you out for a week.

That makes him invaluable.

He have any beefs with anyone?
Hell, no. Everybody loved Art.

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,074
He drove that van into L.A.
full of the good tree.

It was like Santa Claus
was coming to town.

needs a ride home.

830
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,431
Really?

831
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,790
You think if Kavanaugh's successful
I'm gonna go down quietly?

832
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,513
[CHUCKLES]

833
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,840
I will scorch the earth
covering this whole department,

834
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,235
starting with you.

835
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:38,319
I can tie you to every bullshit thing
he's accusing me of and then some.

836
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:43,674
Your stink will smell up
every voting booth in this city.

837
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,550
On the other hand,

838
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,475
you want that little nameplate on
your desk to read "Mayor" someday?

839
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,350
We work together.

840
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:04,310
Make sure that you, me, my team,
are the last men standing

841
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:07,637
long enough
to go our separate ways.

842
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,151
What's your plan?

843
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,476
