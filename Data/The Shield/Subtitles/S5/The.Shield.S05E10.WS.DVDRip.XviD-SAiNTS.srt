Thanks. I didn't know it was public.

I wanted you to hear that from me.

Eh, you know how things
spread around here.
Like herpes at a swingers' party.

While you were stretched out
on the floor over there,

Prednisone in your purse.

They called your doctor to find out
what you were being treated for,

and reported to Phillips.

He just told me.

839
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:46,703
He thought lupus
was an emotional disorder.

I'm sorry.

You don't trust me.

843

I made a mistake.
You made a choice,

844
00:43:58,030 --> 00:44:00,624
to think the worst about me.

Whoever sits up there has to have
an active mistrust of everyone,
