um, a few questions to wrap
up his case, but...

Ionely and I felt bad for him.

he said he was coming after you

But then two of his buddies joined in.
Ripped me up pretty bad.

166
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,358
If you

167
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,439
made different choices
from the beginning,

168
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,915
none of us would be
ripped up right now.

169
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,193
Becca?

170
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,751
Come on, make it look
like we're on a date.

171
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,552
I can't do anything to
help you escape the police.

172
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,115
All right, make it look like
a lovers' quarrel, then.

173
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,915
Look, the only advice I can give you
legally is to turn yourself in now.

174
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,112
That's exactly what I wanna do.
Then we're in the wrong side of town.

175
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,551
Look, I need assurances.
You're not exactly in a position to...

176
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,276
Look, I need to do my time
someplace where the One-Niners
and Antwon Mitchell can't get to me.

177
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,833
All right?
Federal prison, back East.

178
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,749
The feds aren't calling this.
And going fugitive means
the original deal's gone.

179
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:53,157
Then I'll plead to new federal charges.
I'll tell them all the shit that I did.

180
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,157
You can't just serve them
your head on a platter either.

181
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,635
Kavanaugh's not gonna stop
till he's carving me up.

182
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,591
Tell them that I ripped off
an Armenian money-
laundering operation,

183
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,837
stole cash that was part of a
federal sting. I'll plead to that.

184
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,554
You did this by yourself?
Yeah.

185
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,558
Listen to me. They're going to
insist on Vic and the others.

186
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,479
I got nothing to say about them.
Then why are you running?

187
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,877
I'm not running. I'm giving myself up.
All right? I'm ending it.

188
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,116
You want a new deal,
they'll want new information.

189
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,470
I'm giving them new
information on myself.

190
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,715
You are not hearing me.

191
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,798
There will be no deal until
you give them more than you.

192
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,831
Curtis, please. Listen to me.

193
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,873
You have got to think
about yourself one time.

194
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,559
It's your only option.

195
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,150
Now, Vic told me that you guys
sometimes would spread around
some drug money

196
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,952
to keep peace on the streets.
I can spin that...

197
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,358
Listen to me. This Armenian thing
was armed robbery. People got killed.

198
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,834
And they weren't the only ones.

199
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,510
You think it was all just
palming off some drug money
to keep the streets quiet?

200
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,793
I can't tell the truth about the
others because they'll throw us
away for the rest of our lives.

201
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,752
Open your goddamn eyes
to who we are.

202
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,915
People got killed?

203
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,236
Look, this is all
attorney-client privilege.

204
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,829
Detective Terry Crowley...
You've heard enough.

205
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,271
Just get me my deal.
Do my time back East.

206
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,948
Then I'll turn myself in.

207
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,549
I'll call you in a few hours.

208
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,957
Aldo Melchor.
Hey, let me see your hands.

209
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,593
Easy, easy.

210
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,316
SHANE: It's a knife.
To cut my chorizo.

211
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,431
It's okay if I have my lunch?

212
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,959
As long as it's finger food.

213
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,193
What can I do for you, officers?

214
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,915
Well, rumour has it you import more
than just chorizo from down south.

215
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,838
Everything in this store is legal.

216
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,793
Really?

217
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,276
You won't mind if we stick around,
monitor your import-export.

218
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,152
I close at 7.
VIC: Not tonight.

219
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,749
You're gonna stay open until
that shipment of coke arrives.

220
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,997
We're just gonna hang out, provide
a little after-hours security.

221
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,231
Salvadorans realise
you snitched on them,

222
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,351
they're gonna grind you
into chorizo,

223
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,677
sell you by the quarter-pound
like the rest of the sausage
you got down there.

224
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,678
Is there something I can do for you?

225
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,474
Tell us what time the shipment comes.
We'll keep you out of it.

226
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,990
Bust the Salvadorans after they leave,
keep your pipeline up and running.

227
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,069
What else?

228
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,190
Obviously you can import.

229
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,436
Your exporting skills
better be just as good.

230
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,631
I've stayed in business 15 years.

231
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,796
We got a little package
we wanna overnight to Mexico.

232
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,513
How big is it?

233
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,312
About 6'2".

234
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,035
VIC [WHISPERING]:
Hey, yo.

235
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,878
You wanna tell me what the hell
Becca's doing up there?

236
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,513
SHANE [WHISPERING]:
Talking to Kavanaugh and Aceveda.

237
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,076
You think of any scenario
where that's a good thing?

238
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,794
Curtis Lemansky is prepared
to turn himself in.

239
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,157
If you talked to him, you have an
obligation to tell us where he is.

240
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,510
I know my obligations.
I don't know where he is.

241
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,439
Curtis knows where the Barn is
if he wants to turn himself in.

242
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,200
He couldn't hand himself over to you,
for reasons that involve his safety.

243
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,470
Any cop who's incarcerated
faces those risks.

244
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,558
He knew that. He made his choice
when he broke the law.

245
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,988
All we're asking for is protection.

246
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,556
At least until I have a chance to
investigate his claims against
Lieutenant Kavanaugh.

247
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,398
And after that?
He'll accept the previous deal.

248
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,636
As long as we can reasonably
guarantee his safety.

249
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,354
He can't have the same deal.
He ran away from that deal.

250
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,516
And if the council signs off,
they're gonna want more.

251
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,188
My client is willing to
plead to new charges.

252
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,992
But he wants his choice
of federal prisons.

253
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,599
What's he have to say
about his friends?

254
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,552
BECCA: Nothing.
KAVANAUGH: Not good enough.

255
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,116
I have to run this up
a few ladders, so, uh,

256
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,036
give me till the end of the day.

257
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,076
Look, I'll find him first.

258
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,350
Then we can dictate the terms.

259
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,834
I need bodies, though.

260
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,713
I want two surveillance teams
on Mackey and his guys

261
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,433
in case they try to help
Lemansky escape.

262
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,868
You burned your bridges
with the chief.

263
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,389
I need my people on the street.

264
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,113
Becca?

265
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,515
Becca, what happened with Lem?
Is he all right?

266
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,110
Privileged information.
Tell me he's okay.

267
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,191
Well, at least tell me what's wrong.

268
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,277
Wait.
Don't touch me.

269
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,678
Haven't you done
enough damage yet?

270
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,559
Becca, come on. Come on.

271
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,159
Let's go somewhere and talk.

272
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,989
Talk about armed robbery
of an Armenian money-
laundering operation?

273
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,714
Talk about murdering
Terry Crowley?

274
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,319
I told you.
Yes, you did.

275
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,078
And now I know the truth.

276
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,473
I let you touch me.
It makes me sick.

277
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,989
Becca, I don't know
what Lem told you...

278
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,873
No more explanations.
It's all bullshit.

279
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,878
You know, I was worried
about what I'd do

280
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,675
if I had to choose between being
Curtis' lawyer or your friend.

281
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,956
Not anymore.

282
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,872
BILLINGS:
Did you see the guy
who attacked you?

283
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:59,995
No, he just came up from behind me
and started hitting me, and I was
trying to cover my face.

284
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,430
This area can get pretty rough,
even in daylight.

285
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,269
What were you doing here,
besides prettying up the place?

286
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,708
Thanks. Um...

287
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,753
I'm a volunteer tutor at the
community centre on the corner.

288
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,951
I'm just trying to help
some kids, you know?

289
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,115
We're gonna have you come in,
look at some pictures.

290
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,470
But why? I told you
I didn't see him, so...

291
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,352
Maybe you saw more than you think.

292
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,949
Is that really necessary?
Excuse us for a minute.

293
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,358
Send her home. If she remembers
anything, she can call us.

294
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,074
Yeah, why don't you
figure out another way to
get her phone number?

295
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,599
Because I'm bringing her in.

296
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,315
I was acting captain, remember?
I'm making the call.

297
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,913
Hey, it's Curtis.
BECCA [ON PHONE]: Hi.

298
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,872
Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.
What's going on?

299
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,308
They're in a holding pattern.

300
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,272
They said they'd tak e your
offer under advisement,

301
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,914
but gave no indication when
or what the answer might be.

302
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,872
Jesus Christ.

303
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,795
Okay, look, I need you
to get a message to Vic.

304
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,309
That would be breaking the law.
Shit.

305
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,714
All right, forget it. Forget it.

306
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,638
It's gonna be worse
if they catch you.

307
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,150
Now that I've told them
what you want, they know
there's more shit to uncover.

308
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,952
Kavanaugh will show no mercy.

309
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,878
I know.

310
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,153
There is one other option though.

311
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,395
What?

312
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,511
Witness protection.

313
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,510
And you tell them everything.

314
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,636
Witness protection.
The entire truth.

315
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,719
Imagine, you'd be free of
the lies, the running.

316
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,868
People pay a price
for what they did.

317
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,791
I can't. I can't.

318
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,709
Curtis, you're the one with
a heart, now use your head.

319
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,717
This isn't about my goddamn heart.

320
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,592
I'm just trying to
help you here, Curtis.

321
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,234
No, you're trying
to get me to turn

322
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,317
on my family.

323
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,912
Please, just get me my deal.

324
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,795
He held out as long as he could.
He's still holding.

325
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,195
He didn't wanna run in the first place.
He'd run before he would rat.

326
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,118
How do they know
about the money train?

327
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,232
Educated guess.
There's always been plenty of
suspicion, just never any proof.

328
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,396
Unless Lem gave it to them.
VIC: We know Lem.

329
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,353
Look, if he had a change of heart,
he would have tipped us.

330
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,120
Or he wouldn't if his deal
meant us going down.

331
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,790
Look, I'm not saying that it happened.
I'm just saying, are we willing to bet
our freedom that it didn't?

332
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,036
I'm not gonna believe it until
I see it with my own eyes.

333
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,832
Lem's not contacting us
to protect us.

334
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,996
We're gonna meet him
tonight at midnight

335
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,270
and he's gonna travel
tonight. That's it.

336
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,069
Okay.

337
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,158
On whose nickel? Man, this spic cop
doesn't take American Express.

338
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,554
I know.
It's already taken care of.

339
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,478
Look, I told Mara that
Lem was in trouble.

340
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,750
She felt very strongly that
we needed to help him.

341
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,110
So we pulled a little cash
out of the house.

342
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,912
I mean, it's not a lot, but...

343
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,317
Hey, 5 grand ought to keep him in
burritos and beer long enough, man.

344
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,109
All right. Go get this cashed.

345
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,754
Keep half of it for tonight,
put the rest on the wire.

346
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,156
Lem must have said something
to Becca about Terry too.

347
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,915
All that gives Kavanaugh
is a little more suspicion.

348
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,392
Doesn't mean we're gonna
catch a case, let alone a needle.

349
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,556
Lem starts talking,

350
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,638
it puts teeth in an
otherwise empty rumour.

351
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,795
These people,

352
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,992
every time they look at us,
they're gonna see two cop killers.

353
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,553
Now, that's on me.

354
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,716
Terry was a decision
that we both made.

355
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,875
I forced it on you.

356
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,117
Now you're in Kavanaugh's
cross hairs. That's on me.

357
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,550
Lem's gonna have to hide under
a rock for the rest of his life.

358
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,829
That's on me too. I know that.

359
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,792
And skewering yourself
is helping Lem how?

360
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,718
How's it gonna help any of us?

361
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:35,230
You made a call, and that call
was to protect the team.

362
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,000
Now, that couldn't have
gone down any other way.

363
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,668
It's done. It's done.

364
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,633

against Kavanaugh?

365
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,555
I'm gonna find out.

upstairs about?

368
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,591
Call me later.
I'm running out of later.

369
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,829
Now, are you and me still
allies against Kavanaugh,

370
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:02,352
or do I pull out my flamethrower
and start that scorched-earth plan
that I talked to you about?

371
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,513
Becca's being a good lawyer.

372
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,871
Lem wants to turn himself in if
he can get his original deal back.

373
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,274
But Kavanaugh
won't sign off on it.

374
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,675
He's gonna file new charges
for him running.

375
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,313
I thought Kavanaugh
was out of the picture.

376
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,158
He was until Lem didn't show.

377
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,557
And now the chief's believing
that Kavanaugh was right.

378
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,796
He's giving him back all his power.
What about Lem?

379
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,639
You let him twist in the wind?
Claudette's gonna call the DA.

380
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,434
But she's waiting as long as
she can to give Kavanaugh
a chance to find Lem.

381
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,389
And that's all I know.

382

You gotta throw a
wrench in the works.

for intel, and you got one.

beating women on the street?

She set me up.

00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,439
He'll be held in protective custody
until it's all sorted out.

493
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,837
But there's no guarantee of location
unless you can prove your claims.

494
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,435
What about the others?

495
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,074
No condition about him
giving us something on them?

496
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,599
ACEVEDA:
We wanna put this behind us.

497
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,872
Now, if he's caught before
he comes in, all bets are off.

498
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,317
What's going on, man?

499
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,636
What was that?
It wasn't my choice.

500
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,910
It's what the Police
Committee wanted.

501
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,476
If we don't find Lemansky
before he comes in or he
gets out of the country,

502
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:02,357
we're gonna lose our
last chance at nailing Vic
before this case seals off.

503
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,516
What do you want me to do, Jon?

504
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,519
He trusts you now, right?
When it comes to me?

505
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,153
Maybe.

506
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,196
I want you to scare them.

507
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,595
I want you to make
Vic lead us to him.

508
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,869
How?

509
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,633
The way to get him is we
gotta catch him in the act.

510
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,957
With Lemansky AWOL, Vic knows
he's got eyes and ears all over him.

511
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,718
He's not gonna do
anything stupid.

512
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,559
Unless he thinks he's got
one last mess to clean up.

513
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,638
What mess?
There was a detective I spoke to here.

514
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,355
He suspects that the Strike Team
robbed an Armenian money train.

515
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,515
Wagenbach.

516
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,393
Yeah, but he doesn't
know it was Dutch.

517
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,352
You gotta make him believe

518
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:49,030
that Lemansky gave it up
for witness protection.

519
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,912
It'll put him in motion.

520
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,749
We follow, we catch them trying
to help Lemansky escape.

521
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,712
And nail them for
harbouring a fugitive.

522
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,912
It won't be the amount of time that
they deserve, but it'll be enough time

523
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,192
to make them lose their badges
and get them off the street.

524
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,873
Catching them in the act,
that's gonna gives us leverage.

525
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,594
Lemansky, he may have held
his tongue, but the other ones,

526
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,631
they might not be as strong.

527
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,429
Lemansky's talking.
That's bullshit.

528
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,153
Is the Armenian
money train bullshit?

529
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,715
Because that's what he gave
them. He's coming clean.

530
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,273
There's nothing to come clean about.

531
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,359
That explains where your 65,000
unaccounted-for dollars comes from.

532
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,835
Look, he's tired, he's scared
and he wants his freedom.

533
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,508
And he doesn't wanna die at
the hands of Antwon Mitchell.

534
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,836
The DA said he's gotta give them
something on the team.

535
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,508
I guess he's agreed.
Lem would never agree to that.

536
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,030
DA gave him no choice.
He has to give you guys up.

537
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,356
And now all this bullshit
could blow back on me.

538
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,757
Now, you gotta get a
message to your boy and
tell him to shut the hell up.

539
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,428
Can you do that? Hm?

540
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,515
If you can speak to him, can you
convince him to keep his mouth shut?

541
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,357
Yes.

542
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,676
Do it, for chrissake.

543
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,155
I don't know where he is.

544
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,112
You know, Kavanaugh
is out of control,

545
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,153
but with Lemansky unaccounted for,
he's got the chief's ear.

546
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,669
And now the DA's smelling
blood, all of ours.

547
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,314
I shouldn't be telling you any
of this, but you threatened me.

548
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,988
So now I've told you
everything I know.

549
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,515
Now it's time to clean this up.

550
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,513
You guys just see
pimp and hooker.

551
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,039
That's not who we are.

552
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,277
Yeah. Says the hooker
letting pimp daddy drag her
into the shit with him.

553
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,072
TORl:
No, actually he dragged me out.

554
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,511
He dragged me out of
the steaming shit piles

555
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,393

556
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,433
empty everything.

557
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:47,633
And then he hosed me off,
and he held me, and he
made me whole.

558
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,832
I had nothing. I was nothing
before I met him.

559
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,395
According to your sister,
you had a pretty nice condo.

560
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,832
You equate a roof over
your head to love?

561
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,508
What exactly does equal love?

562
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,914
Do you see the wrinkles on my face?

563
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,076
Do you see them?
Yes.

564
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,077
Well, Spank doesn't.

565
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,516
I understand you not wanting to
be away from your, uh, boyfriend.

566
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,439
But what do you think's gonna
happen when you go to jail?

567
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,200
Because we both know that your
man's just gonna set his sights

568
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,312

No, no. Now, let's just sit down.
You don't know me.

Let go of me.

Ooh! She put the claws

do you like that.

Smart, educated, good job.

How do you turn out a girl like that?

Any punk can get some
crack ho to go down on dick.

583
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,112
But how do I get a little pink toe
from Westwood to do what I say,

584
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,799
whenever I say?

585
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,833
Every chick's got
a hole in her heart

586
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,510
and it's connected to
the one between her legs.

587
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,915
I just figure out how to fill it.

588
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,031
And then I feed it to her.

589
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,232
And I keep feeding it to her,
until it's overflowing.

00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,795
Until she can't live without it.

591

And then I take it away.

for some young blood bitch.

she was still the prom queen,

Maybe he felt like he had no choice.

He's out there in the wind alone.
Becca's probably pushing it.

608
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,154
He has no idea about this
ranch in San Ignacio,

609
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,271
or the money we're gonna
be funnelling to him.

No, Aceveda.

Man, he could be full of shit.

613

The truth is, we can't know
what's inside Lem's head
until we see him face to face.

614
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,350
RONNIE:
We need an exit strategy.

00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,515
We don't need an exit strategy.

616
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:49,156
We need to fill Lem in,
on the cash, the ranch,
the lines of communication.

617
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:53,876
He's right. You know, Lem,
he's been in the dark
as much as we've been.

618
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,437
And if Lem is talking,
it's because he believes

619
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,996
that Antwon has marked him
as a dead man behind bars.

620
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,913
Now, once he knows what
we've pulled together for him,
