336
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,955
Are you trying to get rid of me?

337
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,991
I thought Robbery-Homicide
was your dream job.

338
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,919
I didn't need your help.
There is buzz.

339
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,271
Hey, you guys have a Fatima Gardner
sign in to see you this morning?

340
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,873
Yeah.

341
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,116
Her brother just
reported her missing.

342
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,076
Yeah?
Captain left a few things up here.

343
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,713
He asked me to get them.

344
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,388
Sure. Anything you need.

345
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,713
I pulled this off
the wall downstairs.

346
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,876
Pretty demeaning,
don't you think?

347
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,992
Doesn't really bother me.
Just boys being boys.

348
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,760
A lot of money on Vic
being your baby's daddy.

349
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,552
Everybody's got an opinion.

350
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,716
Heard a lot of rumours
about the two of you.

351
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,673
Are you saying that
they aren't true?

352
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,871
Look, I'm sure you
won't blame me

353
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,789
when I don't discuss stupid gossip
about my personal life with IAD.

354
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,436
Sexual relationships between
department personnel

355
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,790
need to be divulged
in a timely manner

356
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,752
according to the
employee handbook.

357
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,997
Failure to do so can
result in suspensions,

358
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,031
even demotions.

359
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,517
You just got a pay bump
recently, didn't you?

360
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,996
Come on, there's no relationship
between me and Vic.

361
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,789
Should I make this official?

362
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,074
Because I can do that,
widen my investigation.

363
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,238
[DANNY SIGHS]

364
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,920
Vic and I had a thing, okay?
It's in the past.

365
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,712
When was that?

366
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,555
Eight or nine months ago?

367
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,149
You wanna get a court order
to draw blood, go right ahead.

368
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,759
But this is none of
your business.

369
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,838
You still have to disclose
your relationship with Mackey.

370
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,996
Fill out the forms today

371
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,270
and I'll overlook the tardiness.

372
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,280
Hey, Vic. Checked out our next
Bop Street target on Hoover.

00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,914
Doors and windows are fortified.

374
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,395
All right, have Ronnie get a
doorknocker. Flash-bangs too.

375
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,749
All right, man.

to pay a visit to another one
of your crack palaces.

Look, man, I don't know
who capped my peoples,

00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,395
but I tell you straight up, it
wasn't no Bop Street niggers.

After Hoover we're gonna stop by
your Temple Street smoke house.

to what, 12 K?

You know what it does
to my street cred even
walking into this pig farm?

383
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,037
Oink when you got
something we can use.

384
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,708
Hold up, hold up, hold up.
Come here.

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,957
Tell him.

I'm chilling at homegirl's
around the way,

hear shots, see these
two vatos drive off.

388
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,996
What did they look like?
Vatos.

You know, shaved heads,
white tees.

tattooed all up in here.

at the dude shooting.

00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,951
So we straight now?
VIC: Not yet.

397
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,835
How's a punk-ass wigger
like Kasper get respect from
a crew hard as Bop Street?

398
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,395
Thought he was a poser
myself for a minute.

Same old shit, only
different coloured caps.

You're moving Kasper's

took down this morning?

Look, man, fiends want
what Kasper's selling.

00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,710
Uh, that guy from IAD got all over
me about department policy,

disclosure of personal
relationships on the job.

Yeah, well, he's pushing me
really hard. Okay?

00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,154
I can't take a suspension
or a pay cut right now.

00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,272
I gotta notify Billings.
I just wanted you to know.

416
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,276
When was the last time
you saw your sister?

417
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,552
Lunchtime. She was gonna run out
for some soda, never came back.

00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,557
Your family drinks a lot of soda.

were out for soda when

It's only a few hours, grown woman.
Bit premature to call the police.

I know my sister. She say
she be back, she be back.

I'll take her room, you take his.

425
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:15,310
Fatima's room's clean. Back door's
unlocked. What do you have?

426
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,873
It's what I don't have.

427
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:22,752
Kleavon's death kit. Latex gloves,
knife, duct tape. It's gone.

I was... I was here earlier.
What?

429
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,636
It was spur of the moment.
Fatima gave her consent.

430
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,354
You searched a murder suspect's
house without backup?

431
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,910
What if Kleavon showed up?

432
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,157
I hid in the closet. He didn't see me.
I slipped out the back door.

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,828
If you're wrong, and he
confronted her after you left...

00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,713
I shouldn't have come alone, but
I wasn't sure you were up to it.

Stress is a trigger, I saw you
were hurting this morning.

00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,877

says he saw a prowler exiting
the backyard this morning,

438
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,199
wearing what he called
"a hundred-dollar suit."

439
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,075
I'll deal with the neighbour
if you think I'm up to it.

440
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,316
Take Kleavon to the Barn,
get a statement.

441
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,114

00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,751
That is one version.

of a relationship between
drug dealers and your clients.

Detective Mackey, either acting alone
or with other members of his team,

449
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,836
killed Detective Crowley or
put him in a position to be killed.

00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:41,919
Just like that Russian I was gonna
murder before you blew our sting?

you wanted to see us?

have better things to do.

you are under investigation

and other allegations of corruption.

a PBA rep, to a lawyer.

and a good one.

here and here, his signature there?

We'll cooperate fully so you can stop
wasting everyone's time, lieutenant.

462
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,068
I suppose you want a statement?

463
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,676
Actually, if you could, uh,
have your clients walk me
through the house

464
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,633
where Terry Crowley was killed,
that would be great.

465
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,632
I'll arrange it soon.

466
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,913
Oh, and take down these photos
or I'll file for harassment.

was David against Goliath.

Or did this murder charge
slip your mind?

this right now.

What the hell's going on?

474
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,832
He told them to bring me in.
Can you take the kids?

475
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,268
You don't have to
talk to him, remember?

your cooperation.

If you feel uncomfortable
at any time, you just leave.

Okay.

find you guys a ride.

Come on, kids. Let's go.

You need anything?
Can I get you something?
Coffee or water?

494

Just ask your questions.

495

You've told me that it's really
difficult to make both the tuitions.

Yet Vic seems to be able to come up
with the money all the time.

00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,557
How do you think
he does that?

498

00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,110
but I feel like things are
starting to make more sense.

823
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,238
Good.

824
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,477
Look, man, I grew up with
my gay uncle living with us,

825
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,956
so it's no big deal to me, but I saw
what he had to go through.

826
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,549
I honestly just didn't
get your situation.

827
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,957
I'm not sure what you're trying to say.
All I'm saying is that I understand.

828
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,594
And it's between you and
your wife anyway, so I'm cool.

829
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,028
You're cool? With what?

830
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,470
That I'm the TO that should've
washed you out weeks ago?

831
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,114
You don't understand anything.

832
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,475
I know why you recommended
me for Robbery-Homicide.

833
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,318
There's no need to thank me.

834
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:56,195
You're getting sicker and you
can't bear for me to see it.

835
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,713
A woman may be dead because
you wanted to protect me.

836
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,473
I shouldn't have done the search
without you. I'm sorry.

837
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:09,759
I do not let my illness
get in the way of my job.

838
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:13,509
You do. That's dangerous.

839
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,115
I'm not leaving you.

840
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:20,915
Detectives? You wanted to be notified
of any black female dump jobs.

841
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,758
Late 40s. Probably strangled.

842
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:27,033
That's not Kleavon's m.o.
That's his sister.

843
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,399
Uni says it looks like rape.
To his own sister?

844
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,397
[SIRENS BEEPING]

845
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,359
OFFICER:
Just showed up on scene.

846
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,477
It's not Fatima.

847
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,231
DUTCH:
Who is it?

848
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,991
Look at this.

849
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,672
He chopped her hair off.
Yeah. Not with scissors.

850
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,512
Probably a knife?

851
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:07,071
You recognise the haircut?

852
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:13,589
Looks like I got under
Kleavon's skin after all.

853
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,676
Hey, thanks for swinging by.

854
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,359
I wanted to finish this in person.

855
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,915
Me too. If you didn't before,

856
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:34,271
now you can see how
out of control Kavanaugh is.

857
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,670
I need to decide if I
wanna represent you.

858
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,399
Any of you.

859
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,751
First you're a sacrificial lamb
to appease angry voters
after that referendum...

860
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,315
We're the good guys in this.
Only not that good.

861
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,988
Because then you tell me Aceveda
had you doing dirty work for him

862
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,111
and is setting you up
to take the fall.

863
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:53,278
Today I find out this is about
capital murder on a cop.

864
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:55,357
Becca, it's a put-up job.
Right now,

865
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:00,235
I have no clue about who
the hell you really are.

866
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,431
How can I help you with that?

867
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:14,272
I actually had a kernel of faith
that you could take the guy down.

868
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,835
Now it just seems like
you've lost your senses.

869
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,395
You're under investigation,
councilman.

870
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:22,637
For what?
Your connection with Mackey.

871
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:27,231
I don't understand how you could
be so gung ho to get this guy

872
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,830
and yet be in his pocket
at the same time.

873
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:31,871
Something I gotta look at.

874
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:36,119
What, you still think that I helped Vic
set you up with that Russian sting?

875
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,475
Man, he got to you.
Playing us against each other.

876
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:43,035
You may as well fold up
your tent and go home.

877
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,191
One thing I know for sure,

878
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,277
when you sat in this office,

879
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:51,268
you could've put an end to him,
but you didn't. Now it's my turn.

880
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:54,836
You seriously think this little
display of yours is gonna work?

881
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:01,595
I need you to initial here, here,

882
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:04,715
and I'd really like
your signature here.

883
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,675
You're sill a reserve cop, right?

884
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,677
I do have authority over you.

885
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,190
You walk out that door,
I'm gonna take your badge

886
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,279
and I'm gonna tell every
reporter in town why.

887
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,072
Then you may as well add
insubordination to your list
of bullshit allegations.

888
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,197
You want any paperwork signed,

889
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,755
you send it to my office, I'll have
the city attorney take a look at it.

890
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,194
Fine.

891
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,879
I'm chairman of the
Police Committee.

892
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,036
This is a fight you don't want.

893
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,197
I didn't want any of it.

894
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:43,714
But I'm here and I'm staying.

895
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,152
Corrine, call me.

896
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:49,158
Kavanaugh's upstairs with Aceveda.
What the hell's going on?

897
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,396
It's almost 8 and he's still at it.

898
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,795
What do we do, just
leave for the night?

899
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,516

900
