VIC:
None that register.

169
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,990
All right, let's find out
who these kids were
and what they were into.

170
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,919
Bodies are still warm.
Let's crack it before they cool.

171
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,313
Shop owner found him on the
pavement. He didn't recognize him.

Strong odour of alcohol.
Any bars nearby?

173
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,634
No. A couple of auto body shops,
a church up the street.

174
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,990
I checked the wallet.
Lives 10 blocks from here.

175
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,239
Good. You're starting
to get an instinct for
the right things to look for.

176
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,514
He didn't walk here on his own.
Not in that condition.

177
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,793
Check the houses on this
side of the alley and look
around for some teeth.

Where have you been?
I'm here now.

181
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,957
Since when does a misdemeanour
drunk in public need two detectives?

182
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,197
I don't think this guy
got plastered and fell over.
He had broken teeth, facial cuts.

183
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,914
I'm calling it an assault.
Any sign of robbery?

184
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,396
Didn't take his money. I'm
thinking he was dumped here.

185
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,114
So he got drunk, he passed out.

186
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,629
They drug him here,
let somebody else deal with it.

187
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,353
It's not the most neighbourly thing,

188
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,790
but we've seen worse
and we didn't call it assault.

189
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,231
Eh... Maybe.

Hang on a second.

191
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,435
I saw you look out.
Now open up. Now.

192
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,437
Always look out your window?
There's cops. I was curious.

193
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,553
Curious enough to see
something that happened
earlier across the street?

194
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,079
We're gonna keep talking.

195
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,556
It's only gonna take your neighbours
about 30 seconds to figure
you do know something.

196
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,228
So you might as well tell me
so I can get off your porch.

I came home to let my dogs out

200

and I saw somebody
leaving that house.

201
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,871
What did he look like?
Got something?

202
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:01,153
I'm not leaving till I find out.
Look, the guy was scary.

203
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,113
He looked right at me
and I went cold.

204

He looked like evil, okay?

205

I picked up Lemansky last night.

Where is he?
Back at the motel.

Feel him out before
I make a move, you know.

What about the rest of the team?
You were right about Lemansky.

214

And this Terry murder?

215
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,313
It is a soft spot.

216
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,634
But with me,
it was still theoretical.

217

I mean, I'm trying to get inside it
and I will get inside it.

that personal element to it.

to close this and you come
running back to me?

this is going, and I'm not
above asking for help.

You suspected Mackey all along,
and you just let him go.

Yeah, well, here's another chance.

Forced retirement.

Out the door?
Fifteen-year pension.

We don't know that yet.

It was a couple of busted windshields.
Why'd we push so hard?

244

Because there's still
some goddamn laws in Farmington,
no matter what the voters reject.

00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,834
He took
the goddamn dogs' heads.

332
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,873
RONNIE:
What's he gonna do?
Put them on a pike?

333
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,549
We gotta find this freak.

334
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,710
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

335
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,193
Councilman.

336
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,150
You two know
each other already.

337
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,396
Curtis.
What are you doing here?

338
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,478
KAVANAUGH:
You've got a big decision
to make, not a lot of time.

339
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:56,593
So I thought you should
get as much information
as possible.

340
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,994
ACEVEDA:
It's time for you to step
into the sunlight, Lem.

341
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,112
LEM:
Look, I didn't do anything wrong.
You're not my captain anymore.

342
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,629
You took some heroin,
you got caught.

343
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,912
Now, we're not just talking
about your career here, Lem.

344
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,271
The city referendum showed all of us
what the public thinks of cops.

345
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,914
The department's fighting
to change that perception

346
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,350
so somebody has to pay a price.

347
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,152
And right now, that's you.

348
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,511
Well, you know what?
I'll take my chances
with the truth in court.

349
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,110
Everything that Lieutenant Kavanaugh
told you about Terry was true.

350
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,194
Terry didn't have a grudge
against Vic going in,

351
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,633
but it only took him
two weeks to find out
that Vic was a dirty cop.

352
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,471
I have his original notes
detailing his suspicions.

353
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,992
He was your teammate,
he was a threat,
so he had to die.

354
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,714
No. Never!

355
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,116
You didn't know, did you?

356
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,875
Vic never told you.

357
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,911
All this time, I thought
the four of you
were in it together,

358
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,034
but you really didn't know.

359
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,956
This changes everything.

360
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,155
You're saying you didn't
know about it until right now.
It was the other guys.

361
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,191
I didn't say that. I didn't say that.

362
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,392
But you didn't know.

363
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,592
I mean, I respect a guy
being loyal, but now
you're protecting a guy

364
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,030
for something that you don't
have any stake in.

365
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,915
Something that you
told me the death penalty
was too good for.

366
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,951
This is a damn witch hunt
right now.

367
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,118
You cannot be a cop
and be a part of it with him.

368
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,275
You gotta choose.

369
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,997
Vic did not kill Terry.
So prove it.

370
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,272
Wear a wire.

371
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,270
Ask him as a friend.
See what he's got to say.

372
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,392
Look, you wanna railroad
an innocent guy,
go ahead and do it.

373
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,591
Do it, but I do not
have to help.

374
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,869
So you'd rather take on prison

375
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,995
than someone
who took out one of your own?

376
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,996
That is a tough choice...

377
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,470
but I understand.

378
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,668
SOLIS:
Guillermo was a jealous man.
The drinking only made it worse.

379
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,438
You give him reason
to be jealous?

380
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,551
Why are you asking me
those questions?

381
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,473
Those are nice shoes.

382
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,319
You get those from Romero?
Saw a pair like them.

383
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,159
They were a gift from El Señor.

384
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,360
How long have you been
sleeping with Romero?

385
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,669
I have never done that.

386
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,394
But he's made advances,
hasn't he?

387
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,669
I'm a married woman.
He made me feel good.

388
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,553
But I told El Señor
I would not betray my vows.

389
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,639
You mean "till death do us part"?

390
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,272
You know what? Know what?

391
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,198
I need a decision.
I need a decision.

392
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,072
What happened
to having some time?

393
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,918
Can't believe you need any.

394
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,236
Look, Vic is your friend
and you're loyal,

395
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,877
but you also gotta be loyal
to your badge.

396
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,833
Gotta be loyal to yourself.

397
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:21,272
To an innocent brother cop.

398
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,793
It's decision time.

399
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:29,189
You tell me. Do I parade you
into Police One

400
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:35,032
or do I call a technician
and wire you up?

401
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,198
ACEVEDA:
You know, Lem,
if Vic is innocent like you say,

402
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,555
you'd be helping him out.

403
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,912
If I do...

404
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,838
what do I get out of it?

405
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,949
SHANE: Doomsday's here?
VIC: According to Emolia's friend.

406
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,909
That's not exactly laying low.
All right, let's go.

407
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,000
VIC: On the ground now!
SHANE: Let's go! Let's go right now!

408
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,515
On the ground!
VIC: Get down on the ground!

409
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,397
You son of a bitch.
You do need your ears cleaned.

410
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,511
Where'd you put
the dogs' heads?

411
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,711
What are you talking about?

412
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,718
Right.

413
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,674
Where does Mackey like to put these?
On the chest.

414
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,836
Make a case on Mackey,
the others, you walk away free.

415
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,557
Here you go.
There's one more thing.

416
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,194
If you lie to me,
try to screw me,

417
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,597
or you just don't live up
to the deal

418
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:08,272
I will push for maximum
for distribution of heroin.

419
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,790
Just know that's the truth.
Did you get all that?

420
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,797
TECH:
Perfect. Mike's working great.

421
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,592
KAVANAUGH:
Let's go.

422
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,510
Hey, hey. Where you going?

423
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,553
I've gotta run an errand. Sorry.
I'll be back in about an hour.

424
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,877
Can it wait? I'm trying to close.
Sorry.

425
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,640
Is everything okay?
Yeah, I'll hurry back.

426
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,153
Well, I'll start. Jump in
when you get back.

427
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,912
DUTCH:
Tox report came back.
He was practically embalmed.

428
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,315
No way he had enough
motor function to swallow,

429
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,078
much less hold the bottle.

430
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,998
It even amazes me
sometimes how much

431
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,317
these chronic alcoholics
can put away.

432
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,794
DUTCH: You, uh,
screwing any other sheep
in your flock, Reverend?

433
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,231
Or you just like giving shoes
to all the pretty wives?

434
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,079
I don't know what
you're talking about.
And in my faith,

435
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,998
I am called Apostle, not Reverend.

436
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,236
How did Guillermo's
front teeth get broken?

437
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,318
He must have fallen down.
You shoved a bottle in his mouth.

438
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,512
Celia Solis said she
wouldn't sleep with you
while her husband was alive,

439
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,075
so you tried to kill him,
but only his brain died.

440
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:21,068
No, the devil did that to him.
Alcohol was his demon.

441
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,918
Santiago said Guillermo
had the shakes.

442
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,315
You notice anything like that?

443
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,875
I left them both asleep
in the sanctuary.

444
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:32,550
I went to my office.
I wrote this week's sermon.

445
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,955
When I returned,
Guillermo wasn't in the church.

446
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,118
I figured he had sobered up
enough to walk home.

447
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,677
And Santiago was too out of it
to say otherwise.

448
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,152
You've got all
your bases covered.

449
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,713
I'll put my hand on the Bible.

450
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:50,390
Not as much fun
as putting your hand
on another man's wife.

451
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,753
VIC:
Get in there, you sick prick.

452
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,675
Glad you could join us.

453
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,958
Hey.

454
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,559
Smells ripe, buddy. Hope you put
a little boom in her womb.

455
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,274
I had to stop by my friend's
on the way back from Chino.

456
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,835
Car broke down so I waited
a half day for a mechanic.

457
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,473
Good thing
you didn't call back.

458
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:20,309
I ain't about to haul my ass
out there to pick
you up. Oh, yeah.

459
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,911
DANNY:
Hey, Vic. Downtown called.

460
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,918
They wanna see any records
that you have on Terry Crowley.

461
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,277
VIC: They say why?
No, just want anything you got.

462
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,358
Probably just wanna close out the file.
Yeah.

463
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:38,155
All right, I gotta pull a couple of
old boxes, but I'll see what I can do.

464
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,191
You missed the first half.
We're still in the game.

465
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,436
I just picked up a suspect
in a triple murder.

466
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,198
Put me in, coach.

467
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,959
It's not him.

468
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,359
VIC:
Oh, for chrissakes. Don't do this.

469
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,357
I said it's not him.

470
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,551
This man killed three
innocent people today.

471
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,708
That's not my fault.

472
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,831
What about the next person
he kills? That will be.

473
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,314
He already killed my dogs.

474
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,909
SHANE:
Well, you think just because
you're not ID'ing him,

475
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,678
he's not gonna try
to kill you too?

476
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,713
You're protecting a killer.
Makes you no better than he is.

477
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,118
IRMA:
Sorry.

478
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:21,914
For the record,
I saw someone, but not him.

479
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,353
What happened to your hands?

480
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,116
Looks like you got
into one hell of a dogfight.

481
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,548
Scratched them up
someplace.

482
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:44,150
Senior Hughes refuses to pay you
protection, Junior winds up dead.

483
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,315
Niggers die every day.

484
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,956
Save that grin for the lineup
before I smack it off your face.

485
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,516
Need a witness for a lineup.
Ruff, ruff.

486
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,398
I'm holding you on suspicion
of vandalism. Cruelty to animals.

487
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,558
That means we're about
eight minutes into
a 12-hour conversation.

488
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,910
Wanna see how cruel I can be
to animals like you?

489
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,873
A lot can happen in 12 hours.

490
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,476
Problem for you
is we don't scare like girls.

491
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:13,070
And our bite's as good
as our bark, asshole.

492
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,549
JULIEN:
We gain entry and do what?

493
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:24,355
TINA:
Separate the parties,
look for visual signs of injury.

494
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,994
You taking the son?
