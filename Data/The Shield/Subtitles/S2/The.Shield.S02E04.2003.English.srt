1
00:00:00,767 --> 00:00:02,369
<i>Previously on The Shield.</i>

2
00:00:02,369 --> 00:00:05,839
This isn't about me, Vic. It's about
our kids, about them being safe.

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,141
I'll move out if I have to,
if that's what it takes.

4
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:10,877
Manny Sandoval skated
two murders I should have had him for.

5
00:00:10,877 --> 00:00:12,746
I've wanted this bastard for a year.

6
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:13,947
Drop the gun now!

7
00:00:13,947 --> 00:00:15,515
I do nothing wrong!

8
00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:19,919
Zayed!

9
00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:21,921
I've got a problem
on this Tio murder.

10
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:24,824
The more I look into it,
the more Vic Mackey's name pops up.

11
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:26,526
I'm going to find the truth.

12
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:29,329
And if I have to go
through both of you... I'll get it.

13
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:33,233
Tell me right now! Where is she?

14
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:34,934
I don't know!

15
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,670
- She's dead.
- She was in the trunk?

16
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,273
The whole time? Marcy,
why didn't you tell me?

17
00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:42,342
Sorry, daddy.

18
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:45,311
You know what I get for those
on the street? Fully automatic.

19
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:46,479
Drop it!

20
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,223
When we retire...

21
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:01,027
...we're going to play golf
together every day.

22
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:03,463
I'd really like that.

23
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:09,402
For his selfless action off-duty
sustaining a gunshot wound...

24
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:12,238
<i>...during the apprehension
</i>of a major gun-running ring...

25
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:17,143
...and for exhibiting the type
of individual awareness, initiative...

26
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:20,780
...and resourcefulness that serves
as an inspiration for all officers...

27
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,483
I'm proud to hereby present
Detective Vic Mackey...

28
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:27,320
...with the department's highest honor
for valor and courage under fire.

29
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:36,329
Everybody here deserves one of these.

30
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:40,400
I was just the guy holding onto it
when the music stopped.

31
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,335
Thank you.

32
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:52,412
Don't think this means you
get a free pass around here.

33
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:55,081
- Of course not.
- Congratulations, Vic.

34
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:57,484
It was Lanie's idea to
recommend you for the medal.

35
00:01:57,484 --> 00:01:59,219
Really? I didn't know that.
Thank you.

36
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:00,453
It's important
that the...

37
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:03,256
...public knows about our successes
as well as our failures.

38
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:06,025
We're running your
Toys for Guns drive tomorrow.

39
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,828
That's where people trade in
their guns to the cops?

40
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:11,464
Yes. While, Vic was
laid out in the hospital.

41
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,366
He came up with this
great twist for us.

42
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:15,134
Yes. They get to fill
out raffle tickets...

43
00:02:15,134 --> 00:02:17,570
...for a big prize when
they trade in their guns.

44
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,507
Which gives us their name and address.
We run the gun for ballistics.

45
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:23,276
If they were used in a crime,
we know where to find them.

46
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:26,045
You thought of that while
you were on a morphine drip?

47
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:27,814
Well, stolen guns
put me there.

48
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,550
I had three weeks to figure out
how to get them off the street.

49
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:32,552
I'm impressed.

50
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:40,126
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Enjoy the toy.

51
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:43,363
- Next.
- Have a nice day.

52
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:46,299
- What's your name?
- Patty Ann Hinkle.

53
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,468
- That's a pretty name.
- Thanks.

54
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:51,237
Where'd you get the gun?

55
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:53,873
Home. I don't like it.

56
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:55,642
Do I get a toy?

57
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:57,410
You sure do.

58
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:00,547
Gimme your
address.

59
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,987
Starting me off with a bang?

60
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:10,523
A robbery. Ended badly.
One dead.

61
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:14,260
Witnesses said the shooter gained
entry using a police badge.

62
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:19,132
Number 714. That's your number.
Where were you two hours ago?

63
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:20,466
With me.

64
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:22,835
Let me see your badge.

65
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:31,544
- This is a fake.
- I got mugged.

66
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,847
I lost my badge in Tijuana. I never
thought it'd end up back in L.A.

67
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:36,583
An L.A. cop badge
sold on the black market.

68
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:37,951
Where the hell else
would you expect it...

69
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:39,719
- ...to be used?
- Let's all calm down.

70
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:42,488
- Did you know about this?
- No. No, he didn't.

71
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:44,324
Where'd you
get this one?

72
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:46,593
This, Serbian guy in Rosehill.

73
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:49,262
- It's just like the real thing.
- No. No, Officer Vendrell.

74
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:52,999
It's not. The real thing got used
in an armed robbery and a killing.

75
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,568
I'm going to clear this whole
thing up. Let me get into it.

76
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:04,711
I'm sorry, man.

77
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:07,580
- Where were you two hours ago?
- I was sleeping.

78
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:10,249
Aceveda seems
pissed, doesn't he?

79
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:12,118
It's just like old times.

80
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,090
- Who's the dead guy?
- He worked here...

81
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,392
...along with our witness,
who isn't saying much.

82
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,399
You saw this go down?

83
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,034
Is the shooter white? Black?

84
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:30,670
He had a mask. Happened quick.

85
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,838
What'd he take?

86
00:04:32,271 --> 00:04:34,173
- Nothing.
- So he used the cop's badge...

87
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:35,508
...to get you to
unlock the place.

88
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:38,511
He murders a guy for no reason,
steals nothing and leaves?

89
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:50,556
This guy definitely
knew what he was after.

90
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,459
Whatever it was, it wasn't supposed
to be here. Am I right?

91
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:03,036
What if I told you my buddy and I here
have a little side business...

92
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,538
...helps victims
get their stuff back.

93
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:12,712
You offered to get his stolen
merchandise back for a fee?

94
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:14,881
He was hiding something
he wasn't going to tell a clean cop.

95
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:17,650
- You thought this would work?
- It already has. He's cooperating.

96
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:21,788
The store is a front for
an Armenian mob diamond chop shop.

97
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:24,290
- He told you this?
- He wants his diamonds back.

98
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:27,226
They fence hot ice. Recut the gems,
put 'em in different mountings

99
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:29,829
...so they can't be ID'd...
then they resell them.

100
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,564
This is what our shooter stole.

101
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,272
This is
entrapment.

102
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:41,441
Just for the jeweler...
and he's a guppy.

103
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,109
We're hunting a whale here.

104
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:46,746
You want us to catch
this killer or not?

105
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:50,516
Going undercover as dirty cops.

106
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:52,618
You think you can pull that off?

107
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,687
We can try.

108
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:08,969
You know, being crooked cops when
it's my ass and badge on the line...

109
00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:11,271
- It's not as fun.
- Yes, well,...

110
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:12,873
...we're only pretending
to be crooked cops.

111
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,808
So we're not really
taking a cut of the jewelry?

112
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:17,711
Well, it's always an option,
but today I'm feeling good.

113
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:26,286
Flip that right there. Yes.
That's got a little thing right there.

114
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:28,188
I got some stuff too,
in the back.

115
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:32,859
Man! You havin' a sidewalk sale
and you didn't invite us, Taylor?

116
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,961
I thought we was on
your mailing list.

117
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:36,363
This has a remote, right?

118
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:39,766
Okay. Listen. I gave you Fleetwood,
okay? I'm free and clear.

119
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:42,002
Just one more favor...
swear to God.

120
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:44,504
You know who might be movin'
this kinda stuff?

121
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,674
No. No. I don't usually
travel in those circles.

122
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:50,777
Find out who does and then buzz me.

123
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:55,148
Look, man. You know, CIs are supposed
to be registered and paid, man.

124
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:58,919
Tell you what. Here's a fin.
Go buy yourself a taco.

125
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,755
That's a $50 box.

126
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:07,527
Thank you.

127
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:09,863
I can't believe this.
It was a clean shoot.

128
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:12,732
I know. I was hoping lawyers
wouldn't get involved.

129
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,235
Let's just hear
what they have to say.

130
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:23,643
Five million makes this go away.

131
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:25,545
Well, five million makes me laugh.

132
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,447
I didn't do
anything wrong.

133
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,849
Your officers improperly
entered the Al-Thani home...

134
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:32,953
...establishing a pattern of racial
insensitivity and abusive behavior.

135
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,321
He gave us
permission to enter.

136
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:36,223
Only after you threatened
to bring in the F.B.I.

137
00:07:36,223 --> 00:07:37,457
You treated him
like a criminal,...

138
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,892
...which escalated the
dispute with the neighbor.

139
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:40,227
She felt she
could attack him.

140
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:42,495
- He needed to defend his life.
- This is ridiculous!

141
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:45,131
The search was legal.
The shooting, by the book.

142
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,399
We don't agree.

143
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:49,236
I'll be expecting your counteroffer
by the end of the day.

144
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:50,937
I wouldn't hold my breath.

145
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:53,907
Did I mention we're
also naming you...

146
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:56,009
...as well as Officer
Sofer in the civil suit?

147
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,312
Think it over.

148
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:05,919
You Tike?

149
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:08,288
He'll be back later.
What do you want?

150
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:09,589
How 'bout an
honest answer.

151
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,558
A friend of mine says you're
trying to move some hot rocks.

152
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:14,427
Man. What the hell you doing, man?

153
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:17,831
- We're cops.
- It's him.

154
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,132
Give me the keys.

155
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:20,500
I'd like to see
a warrant.

156
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,370
I'd like to see Anna Kournikova
naked on a water bed.

157
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:27,007
- I'm calling 911.
- Go ahead.

158
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,075
We'll come back in five minutes
and take your report.

159
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:33,146
I'll start with possession
of stolen property.

160
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:35,282
It's an exact match
to our crime scene.

161
00:08:35,282 --> 00:08:36,616
Who sold you this stuff?

162
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:40,954
I'll tell you what. You get the guy
who sold you these down here...

163
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:42,856
...and I'll give you
a third of them to keep.

164
00:08:43,423 --> 00:08:46,026
You'll let me keep a third?

165
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:48,295
Hell of a deal.

166
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,164
What kinda cops are you?

167
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:54,601
Ballistics just got a hit
on one of Vic's Toys for Guns.

168
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:57,904
Well, maybe they'll
give him a second medal.

169
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:03,243
Slug from a test-fire matches up
to an unsolved murder from last year.

170
00:09:03,677 --> 00:09:04,778
One of yours.

171
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,782
Richard Cummings. Yes.

172
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:10,283
Who's Richard Cummings?

173
00:09:10,684 --> 00:09:13,820
This is a guy who took a loan from
a shark named Manny Sandoval.

174
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,855
Couldn't pay the money back,
ended up dead.

175
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:17,857
It's obvious Manny killed him.

176
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:21,161
So why does somebody else
have the murder weapon?

177
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,196
Find out.

178
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,332
Yes.

179
00:09:25,332 --> 00:09:27,600
- He's talking to his old lady.
- He's not going to show.

180
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,072
Coffee, cigarettes, and too much
joviality. Smells like a 12-step.

181
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,774
Excuse me.
What program is this?

182
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,843
- Gamblers Anonymous.
- Thanks.

183
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:38,778
It's that time of year...

184
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,147
Two days after the Super Bowl...

185
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:44,250
...everybody finds a higher power
when they lose their shirts.

186
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:46,252
I lost 100 bucks on
the goddamn Raiders.

187
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,988
- I'll be damned.
- What?

188
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:50,890
That's Manny Sandoval.

189
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,359
The loan shark? Where?

190
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:53,660
In the alley.

191
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,930
So your suspect is hanging
outside the meeting...

192
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,099
...where the guy who owns
the murder weapon is?

193
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,000
- Some coincidence.
- Hell of one.

194
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:04,270
You want to take him in?

195
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,072
Manny doesn't crack easy.

196
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:09,175
And he won't sweat unless I'm packing
a lot more info than I got now.

197
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:12,212
Let's wait and talk
to the gun owner first.

198
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,220
So what's so important?

199
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:23,189
Hope you hocked enough for bail.

200
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:27,527
Where's my badge,
you dumb ass?

201
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,330
Work with me here, all right?
I need a deal.

202
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:33,133
We don't. We have you
for robbery and homicide...

203
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:36,069
...and being dumb enough to sell
the jewelry that ties you to both.

204
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:38,938
Look, I needed the money, all right?
But you don't have everything.

205
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,009
- Alex Eznik.
- Alex who?

206
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:46,312
He runs the Zeroun family
for the Armenian mob. What about him?

207
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,815
<i>I give you Alex, you
</i>shave some years, right?

208
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:50,683
<i>Convince me.</i>

209
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,886
<i>I work protection for him.</i>

210
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,954
<i>He owns that jewelry shop I hit.</i>

211
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:56,322
And you robbed
your own boss?

212
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,658
I was taking back something
that didn't belong to him.

213
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:00,794
- That's all.
- Well, why'd you kill the guy?

214
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:02,796
'Cause he was a thief of Alex's...

215
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:06,232
...who stole some jewelry from
a store I provided protection over.

216
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,601
What? Wait a minute.

217
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:11,638
You work for Alex. The
dead guy worked for Alex.

218
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:14,707
He robbed from you.
You robbed back and killed him?

219
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:17,410
Doesn't sound like a
very happy family.

220
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,611
No. It's not.

221
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:20,480
Yes. And Alex
encourages competition...

222
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,215
...especially between Russian
Armenians like him...

223
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:24,050
...and Lebanese
Armenians like me.

224
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:27,187
That's why I didn't
mind ripping Alex off.

225
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,555
What else can you
tell me about Alex?

226
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:29,756
Everything.

227
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:31,991
<i>Gambling. Hijacking.</i>

228
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:34,761
<i>You ever heard a rumor
</i>about a money train?

229
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:36,129
What's a money train?

230
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:38,765
Story goes it's like a
rolling bank vault.

231
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:40,133
Supersecret.

232
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:43,069
Supposedly runs out of L.A.
every couple of months...

233
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:45,138
...to clean their
dirty money overseas.

234
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:49,876
How much money
are we talking about here?

235
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:52,378
I hear it's big.

236
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:55,548
So who do I make a deal with?

237
00:11:58,751 --> 00:11:59,953
- No.
- Why not?

238
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:02,755
Because we've already got the killer.
This is where it ends.

239
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:05,425
We got a line on the biggest
Armenian mobster in L.A.

240
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:06,893
I'm not running a
mob task force.

241
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:09,028
- You don't have to.
- You just have to watch.

242
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,732
Let me return the jewels to Alex...

243
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,335
...see if he wants to buy a dirty cop.

244
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:18,238
You're having too much fun
playing this.

245
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:20,940
Well, inside I'm a sad clown.

246
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:23,309
What about the jewels?

247
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:24,844
You already gave a third
to the pawnbroker.

248
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:26,679
You want to give the
rest to the mob boss?

249
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:27,981
Well, that's the deal I made.

250
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:30,650
If I want them to think
that I'm a corrupt cop,...

251
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,151
...I at least got to
be honest about it.

252
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:33,386
I don't like it.

253
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,855
And I especially don't like
you in the middle of it.

254
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:39,626
You know how Giuliani
became the mayor of New York?

255
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:41,761
He brought down the mob.

256
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:48,868
I want to know
every move you make.

257
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,103
Absolutely.

258
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:01,648
There he is.

259
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:10,924
Mr. Hinkle.

260
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:13,860
Detectives Wyms and Wagenbach.

261
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:15,862
We'd like to speak with you.

262
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:17,830
Is everything okay?

263
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:20,800
- I wouldn't bet on it.
- Come on.

264
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,005
<i>That's Richard Cummings...</i>

265
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:28,374
...a man who lost a lot of money
in a restaurant.

266
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:33,146
He's also a guy who was
into Manny Sandoval for $50,000.

267
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,314
Your gun
killed him,...

268
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,950
...so don't bother wasting our
time with a bullshit excuse.

269
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,518
Where'd you get
my gun from?

270
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:41,888
Your daughter traded it in
during a toys for guns drive.

271
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:45,558
How much did Manny pay you to use your
weapon... Or did you do it for him?

272
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:46,726
What?

273
00:13:47,594 --> 00:13:49,262
We also checked your phone records.

274
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:51,297
You seem to call
phone booths a lot.

275
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:53,199
Is that your bookie
or your loan shark?

276
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,501
Certainly wasn't your sponsor.

277
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:00,907
Where's my daughter?

278
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:07,981
A complaint has been lodged against
you by a man named Abu Ibish.

279
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:10,116
- Who?
- Six months ago.

280
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:12,752
Some bar fight you broke up.

281
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:16,122
- I don't remember.
- At the Lakeside Tavern.

282
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:19,559
I get a lot of calls there.
What was the complaint?

283
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:22,996
This guy says that you used racial
epithets prior to arresting him...

284
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:26,265
...derogatory comments
referring to his Arab ethnicity.

285
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:29,035
This is bullshit.

286
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:30,670
Well, how would
you know?

287
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:32,872
You don't even
remember the arrest.

288
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,540
I'd remember
that.

289
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,642
Danny...

290
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,511
...if you made any
anti-Arab comments...

291
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:40,213
I didn't.

292
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,016
Even in the heat of the moment.

293
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:44,584
I need to know now.

294
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:47,520
I didn't.

295
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,595
My name's on that lawsuit too.

296
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,205
- What the hell is that?
- I don't know, but buy me a ticket.

297
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:07,273
Yes.

298
00:15:07,674 --> 00:15:08,875
Hold it.

299
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:11,044
He's expecting us.

300
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,051
Mr. Eznik.

301
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,154
I believe these are yours.

302
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,093
Some are missing.

303
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,529
That's right. A third.

304
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,132
That's the deal I made with your boy
over at the jewelry store.

305
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:36,069
You made that deal with him.
You didn't make it with me.

306
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:37,236
A third is a lot of money.

307
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:38,538
It was a lot of work.

308
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:42,408
I don't like cops in my social club.

309
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,144
Fine. Then we'll leave.

310
00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:51,050
You have an auto shop
over on Waverly, right?

311
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,619
Yes. From what we hear,
it's filled with stolen car parts.

312
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,822
Police are going to raid it
in about three hours.

313
00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:57,290
Why are you telling me this?

314
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,559
Shane and I here are
looking to moonlight.

315
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:04,564
First tip's a freebie.

316
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:06,866
Next one will cost ya.

317
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:14,807
Now we're waiting for
the Armenian to call back.

318
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,909
- I said keep this simple.
- It is simple.

319
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:20,580
I need a raiding party
at this address in two hours.

320
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,948
Not a moment
sooner.

321
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:24,050
- To find what?
- Nothing.

322
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,985
It'll be cleared out by
the time they get there.

323
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,189
Look. I know it's your world, but I'm
the one who lets you work in it.

324
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,358
Clear this with me before
next time.

325
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:34,360
I would have.
I just didn't have a chance.

326
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,129
What about this money train?

327
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:37,797
If it exists, we'll get to it.

328
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:39,665
- When?
- Soon.

329
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,735
I'm transferring Shane
off the Strike Team.

330
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:47,907
- What?
- I see you're listening to me now.

331
00:16:47,907 --> 00:16:49,208
Shane is my partner.

332
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:52,712
I'm thinking Vice might be
a more appropriate assignment for him.

333
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:58,317
Where does this bullshit come from?

334
00:16:58,317 --> 00:16:59,786
An all-white team
knocking down doors...

335
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:02,622
...in an 83% minority
neighborhood is bad policy.

336
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:03,756
We had a deal.

337
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:07,260
I keep my nose clean
You keep your nose outta my business.

338
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,695
Well, Shane didn't
keep his nose clean, did he?

339
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:12,165
So we're going to
find somebody who can...

340
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:15,034
...either a black or a Latino.

341
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:25,611
Feeling okay?

342
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:27,246
Fine. Just a little
office politics.

343
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:28,648
What's the issue?

344
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,219
Actually, it's something you
might be able to help me with.

345
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,688
Aceveda's trying to ram something
down my throat.

346
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:37,790
You mean adding a minority
to your Strike Team?

347
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,294
- Yes. That's right.
- That was my idea.

348
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:44,497
And it's a good one, in theory...

349
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:47,800
...but I don't have another spot open
on my squad.

350
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:50,903
David told me
he was opening up a spot.

351
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,171
He was mistaken.

352
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:54,106
Look. An all-white unit...

353
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:56,976
...smashing down doors
in a heavily minority neighborhood...

354
00:17:56,976 --> 00:17:59,946
It's just bad policy.
You'll get used to the idea.

355
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,655
That's it exactly.

356
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:15,495
Appreciate your tip.

357
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:17,764
My men were able to clear
everything out just in time.

358
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,236
- Here you are, gentlemen.
- How did the police know about it?

359
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:25,505
Seems like you pissed off the
wrong Lebanese Armenian.

360
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:27,273
Hrach?

361
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:31,110
Once he killed the jewel thief,
I guess he felt compelled to open up.

362
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,612
How do I shut him up?

363
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:34,681
While he's in custody, you can't.

364
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:35,915
Shit.

365
00:18:38,685 --> 00:18:40,420
How much to have him taken out?

366
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:42,755
- How you doing?
- What, killed?

367
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:46,659
No. It's not possible.

368
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:49,195
Not killed. Not killed.
Just taken out of jail.

369
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:51,097
I'll deal with him myself.

370
00:18:51,531 --> 00:18:53,233
That'll cost you more than you have.

371
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:56,035
Yes, but, it can be done.

372
00:18:56,035 --> 00:18:58,338
- It's possible.
- He's in custody for murder.

373
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:01,975
Well, I am
the arresting officer.

374
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,945
I suppose if I made a
technical error...

375
00:19:07,413 --> 00:19:09,182
...violated his rights somehow.

376
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:12,919
Yes, Yes.
How much to violate his rights?

377
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:19,826
You want me to release a murderer
so that his mob boss can kill him?

378
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:21,961
It sounded better the way
Vic explained it to me.

379
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:24,063
We're not going to
let Alex kill Hrach.

380
00:19:24,063 --> 00:19:26,599
- Well, that's a relief.
- We're going to do it ourselves...

381
00:19:27,267 --> 00:19:29,736
...or at least provide
a reasonable facsimile.

382
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:31,838
All we need is a body.

383
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:39,078
What do you want now, the keys to the
morgue? When does this stop?

384
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:40,880
When we take
Alex down.

385
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,216
Look, the only way
to nail him...

386
00:19:43,216 --> 00:19:45,552
...is to catch him
paying us off for the hit.

387
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:47,420
I'm pulling the plug.

388
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,122
Alex needs to see a body.

389
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:51,925
I mean, showing him a picture of
some uni in Halloween makeup...

390
00:19:51,925 --> 00:19:53,293
...isn't going to cut it.

391
00:19:57,096 --> 00:19:59,332
If this ends in anything
but total success...

392
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:01,768
...you can join him on Vice.

393
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:08,107
What the hell's
he talking about?

394
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:11,277
Who knows?

395
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:16,616
It's a little
clammy in here.

396
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:19,052
- You'll get used to it, Manny.
- I won't need to.

397
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:21,187
You fronted Richard Cummings
money for a restaurant...

398
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:23,289
...that closed after two weeks, right?

399
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:27,393
I don't lend money.
I'm not a loan shark.

400
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:29,095
Cummings never paid you back.

401
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:31,164
Why would he? I never
lent him a dime.

402
00:20:31,164 --> 00:20:33,766
Lance Hinkle also owed you money...
A fortune.

403
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:35,835
Don't know a Hinkle.

404
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:38,905
You clear his debt.
He helps you kill Cummings.

405
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:41,808
Sell it to the Grimms Brothers.

406
00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:50,817
I've got your lies on record.
Now sit there...

407
00:20:50,817 --> 00:20:52,285
...while I prove them wrong.

408
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:56,556
Take Bob and Marcy.
They lived next door to the victim.

409
00:20:56,556 --> 00:21:00,159
He had a prior for kidnapping, liked
young women. I should have seen it.

410
00:21:00,627 --> 00:21:02,328
Could you concentrate
on this case, please?

411
00:21:02,328 --> 00:21:05,565
I'm using it to illuminate this case.
Excuse me.

412
00:21:05,565 --> 00:21:08,001
It was Hinkle's gun.
Hinkle doesn't have an alibi.

413
00:21:08,001 --> 00:21:09,135
It should
be Hinkle.

414
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:12,772
Hinkle's got nothing to do with
Cummings or the restaurant.

415
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:14,073
What about the dead guy's wife?

416
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:18,311
Maybe she and Hinkle, having an
affair, want the husband dead.

417
00:21:18,311 --> 00:21:21,014
The widow's got no insurance money.
She's not involved.

418
00:21:21,014 --> 00:21:22,515
It's worth
checking out.

419
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:26,052
Look... I've got a suspect.
His name is Manny Sandoval.

420
00:21:26,052 --> 00:21:27,353
And I'm bringing him in.

421
00:21:27,687 --> 00:21:32,025
I'm having a hard time explaining why
we're backing you for city council...

422
00:21:32,025 --> 00:21:33,626
...when you seem to be
wholly unconcerned...

423
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,128
...with our community's needs.

424
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:36,396
What are we talking
about here?

425
00:21:36,396 --> 00:21:38,598
A gang member died in a
drive-by shooting this week.

426
00:21:38,598 --> 00:21:42,035
His gang has demanded a funeral mass
at his family's church...

427
00:21:42,035 --> 00:21:44,937
...but our new reverend
refused on principle.

428
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,809
Since then, the church
has been vandalized...

429
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:52,745
...and he has received death threats.

430
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,481
That's unacceptable.

431
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:59,152
A community's strength
stems from its leaders...

432
00:21:59,552 --> 00:22:01,220
...especially its spiritual ones.

433
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:05,224
I'll assign a protection detail
immediately.

434
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:16,469
Just got a suicide call. White
male, 20s, just blew his head off.

435
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:19,972
Perfect. I'm going to need
your clothes and your wallet.

436
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:26,946
What the hell is this?

437
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:28,381
We found our candidate.

438
00:22:28,781 --> 00:22:30,383
- Who?
- Some guy.

439
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,185
What guy? Where?

440
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:34,587
Dead guy. No face, no
relatives, no problem.

441
00:22:34,587 --> 00:22:36,889
- I'm coming with.
- Sure. We'll meet you there.

442
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,892
- What's the address?
- I think Cacuzza's got it.

443
00:22:42,729 --> 00:22:43,896
They're setting up.

444
00:22:43,896 --> 00:22:45,698
All right.
Set the camera up in here.

445
00:22:47,433 --> 00:22:50,002
Alex is on his way.
We got 15 minutes, tops.

446
00:22:50,002 --> 00:22:51,637
You know what? We'll...
We'll take it from here.

447
00:22:51,637 --> 00:22:53,439
Yes. We're not done
with the investigation.

448
00:22:56,142 --> 00:22:57,477
Time to swap out the clothes.

449
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,983
- You said he blew his face off!
- That's what I was told!

450
00:23:03,983 --> 00:23:06,586
What did he do, miss?
He's totally recognizable!

451
00:23:06,586 --> 00:23:08,855
Jesus Christ.
He's going to be here any minute.

452
00:23:11,324 --> 00:23:12,391
God.

453
00:23:13,426 --> 00:23:15,795
All right. Go... Go to my car
and get my shotgun.

454
00:23:16,295 --> 00:23:17,930
- What?
- Just do it!

455
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:25,505
Don't worry.
You won't feel a thing.

456
00:23:26,606 --> 00:23:28,775
- I'll walk the neighborhood.
- What should I do?

457
00:23:28,775 --> 00:23:30,910
Stop anyone
from killing the reverend.

458
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:34,714
Try to keep me in sight.

459
00:23:52,298 --> 00:23:55,234
Excuse me. What are you doing?

460
00:23:55,835 --> 00:23:57,737
- Hi, Officer.
- Hi.

461
00:23:58,371 --> 00:24:00,306
- What are you doing?
- I know this looks weird...

462
00:24:00,306 --> 00:24:02,975
...but I'm a volunteer coach
for a kids' soccer team.

463
00:24:02,975 --> 00:24:04,811
- Yes. I see that.
- Well...

464
00:24:04,811 --> 00:24:06,979
One of them found a squirrel
by the side of the road.

465
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:09,582
It was the only way
to get him to stop crying.

466
00:24:10,249 --> 00:24:11,918
I promised to send it
to squirrel heaven.

467
00:24:12,752 --> 00:24:14,787
Okay. Well, that's not really legal.

468
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:16,255
Well, I didn't know
what else to do.

469
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,491
I just wanted Jordan
to feel better.

470
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:25,164
Well, that's sweet. Okay.

471
00:24:25,731 --> 00:24:26,899
Bury it deep.

472
00:24:28,835 --> 00:24:30,002
Thanks.

473
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:38,010
You want to give
him the face-lift?

474
00:24:38,344 --> 00:24:39,512
I'll pass.

475
00:24:40,012 --> 00:24:41,180
Pussy.

476
00:24:45,318 --> 00:24:46,919
You're not here to realize it...

477
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:49,522
...but you're doing a good thing.

478
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,031
Yes. That's better.

479
00:25:00,266 --> 00:25:01,834
Okay. Camera's got signal.

480
00:25:05,238 --> 00:25:07,039
- God.
- Where've you been?

481
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:11,210
He gives you the money.
You give the signal. You get out.

482
00:25:11,477 --> 00:25:14,313
And hear me... this is it.
Understand?

483
00:25:15,147 --> 00:25:16,282
Sure.

484
00:25:23,823 --> 00:25:26,025
When he gets the money, we go...
On my mark.

485
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:27,126
Got it.

486
00:25:30,563 --> 00:25:33,532
- We got to go.
- Thank you, sir.

487
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:34,734
One of them yours?

488
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,138
No. I used to play.

489
00:25:39,138 --> 00:25:40,306
Bye.

490
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,075
No. Most of these kids
don't have fathers.

491
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:45,478
That's very nice.

492
00:25:45,978 --> 00:25:47,413
We have a game on Sunday.

493
00:25:48,681 --> 00:25:51,083
Maybe if you're not working
you could stop by.

494
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,489
Yes, I'm free on Sunday.

495
00:25:56,489 --> 00:25:57,523
Great.

496
00:26:03,429 --> 00:26:04,997
You killed him yourself.

497
00:26:05,197 --> 00:26:06,766
Yes. He got a little squirrelly.

498
00:26:06,766 --> 00:26:08,567
We're going to have to
charge you extra...

499
00:26:09,869 --> 00:26:11,304
<i>...for saving
</i>you the trouble.

500
00:26:11,304 --> 00:26:12,405
All right. Here we go.

501
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:13,906
<i>How much do you
</i>think he told them?

502
00:26:14,273 --> 00:26:15,508
<i>We can find out.</i>

503
00:26:15,808 --> 00:26:17,843
He was very involved
in a lot of my businesses.

504
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:19,946
He knew a lot of things.

505
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:23,950
Perhaps you can help
with some protection.

506
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:25,718
Get ready.

507
00:26:29,855 --> 00:26:32,491
- Hold! Hold! Don't do this to me.
- <i>Holding.</i>

508
00:26:32,491 --> 00:26:33,693
Like with what?

509
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:35,728
Let's talk someplace else.

510
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,977
I'd like to know if any more
of my places are going to be raided.

511
00:26:50,977 --> 00:26:53,546
Give me the addresses.
I'll check 'em out at my station.

512
00:26:53,947 --> 00:26:55,048
It'll take a couple hours.

513
00:26:55,048 --> 00:26:58,952
That's delicate information to give to
a police officer that I barely know.

514
00:26:59,986 --> 00:27:01,054
Fine.

515
00:27:01,588 --> 00:27:03,523
If you need me some other time,
give me a call.

516
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:06,593
Wait.

517
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,728
Hagop.

518
00:27:09,496 --> 00:27:12,265
Hagop knows the addresses.
He'll go with you.

519
00:27:12,565 --> 00:27:14,934
- Works for me.
- And he'll stay here.

520
00:27:17,036 --> 00:27:20,406
It's insurance, you know? You have
one of my men. I have one of your men.

521
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:26,646
Make sure he doesn't catch anything.

522
00:27:27,647 --> 00:27:29,349
- See you soon.
- Yes.

523
00:27:38,458 --> 00:27:41,094
We believe one of these men
killed Richard.

524
00:27:41,094 --> 00:27:42,896
Claudette, I didn't see his face.

525
00:27:43,296 --> 00:27:44,497
He was running.

526
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:47,166
Take a look.

527
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:53,706
I'm sorry. I just...
I didn't see a face.

528
00:27:54,841 --> 00:27:57,343
- It was nine months ago.
- It's okay.

529
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,345
There's one thing I don't understand.

530
00:27:59,879 --> 00:28:02,815
The night your husband was killed,
you were home alone with him?

531
00:28:02,815 --> 00:28:04,083
That's right.

532
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:05,952
You have two small children.

533
00:28:05,952 --> 00:28:08,087
It was a Wednesday night,
middle of the school week.

534
00:28:08,087 --> 00:28:09,489
Why weren't they in the house?

535
00:28:09,489 --> 00:28:12,125
Their grandmother takes them
ice-skating on Wednesday nights.

536
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:15,428
They sleep over,
and then she drops them at school.

537
00:28:15,428 --> 00:28:16,996
It would be interesting
if the killer...

538
00:28:16,996 --> 00:28:19,198
...knew the kids wouldn't
be in the house.

539
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:21,034
Fewer possible
witnesses...

540
00:28:21,801 --> 00:28:23,570
Or maybe to spare
them the trauma...

541
00:28:24,437 --> 00:28:27,440
...which is odd unless the
killer knew them personally.

542
00:28:28,241 --> 00:28:29,943
- Are you saying that I...
- Excuse me.

543
00:28:32,979 --> 00:28:34,113
Come here.

544
00:28:38,818 --> 00:28:40,486
What the hell are you doing?

545
00:28:41,588 --> 00:28:43,289
Pursuing an angle
of investigation.

546
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:44,824
By attacking my witness?

547
00:28:44,824 --> 00:28:46,259
She's not much
of a witness.

548
00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:48,861
That's right. She's the victim.
I cleared her nine months ago.

549
00:28:48,861 --> 00:28:51,664
You cleared her of any connection
to Manny. What about Hinkle?

550
00:28:51,664 --> 00:28:52,999
She's not in this.

551
00:28:54,834 --> 00:28:56,803
- Maybe it's just that simple.
- Goddamn it.

552
00:28:56,803 --> 00:28:58,171
She's not Marcy.

553
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:02,342
Now, you screwed up your case.
Fine. It happens.

554
00:29:03,276 --> 00:29:05,144
But don't screw up mine.

555
00:29:06,512 --> 00:29:07,647
Take that back.

556
00:29:07,647 --> 00:29:08,781
Later.

557
00:29:08,982 --> 00:29:11,184
Right now, I'm handling this case.

558
00:29:11,451 --> 00:29:12,585
Alone.

559
00:29:22,362 --> 00:29:24,831
Cummings's wife saw you
outside the house...

560
00:29:24,831 --> 00:29:26,799
...the night you
killed her husband.

561
00:29:27,834 --> 00:29:30,136
She just positively ID'd you.

562
00:29:32,205 --> 00:29:33,306
You're done.

563
00:29:46,853 --> 00:29:49,455
Hinkle spilled his guts
like a cheap pinata.

564
00:29:50,056 --> 00:29:52,992
How you'd excuse the vig on his loan
in exchange for killing Cummings.

565
00:29:52,992 --> 00:29:54,427
Not the principle, though.

566
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:56,529
You're a piece of work.

567
00:29:57,096 --> 00:29:58,498
It's his word against mine.

568
00:29:59,265 --> 00:30:03,803
Believe me. When he's on that stand,
and his little girl's there...

569
00:30:03,803 --> 00:30:05,872
...and he's bawling like a baby...

570
00:30:06,239 --> 00:30:08,408
...they're going to believe
every word he says.

571
00:30:13,413 --> 00:30:15,381
I don't need a confession.

572
00:30:16,749 --> 00:30:17,850
Take him.

573
00:30:22,488 --> 00:30:23,589
Let's go.

574
00:30:25,591 --> 00:30:28,928
They could still be undercover.
They could be doing God knows...

575
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:32,298
Never mind.

576
00:30:33,533 --> 00:30:36,002
Nothing. I guess he didn't
squeal on that one.

577
00:30:36,002 --> 00:30:37,370
What's the next address?

578
00:30:38,438 --> 00:30:40,339
4103 Merrick.

579
00:30:41,107 --> 00:30:42,375
And this is?

580
00:30:43,109 --> 00:30:45,511
Cigarettes, tax-free.

581
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:50,183
Well, your smokers can cough up
their lungs in peace. Next address.

582
00:30:50,817 --> 00:30:52,518
This one's not really anything...

583
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:54,987
...but since we're here,
check it anyway.

584
00:30:54,987 --> 00:30:56,355
Sure. Give
it to me.

585
00:30:56,622 --> 00:30:59,592
9210 Escovida.

586
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,495
And this is?

587
00:31:02,495 --> 00:31:05,531
Not sure. Storage or something.

588
00:31:07,033 --> 00:31:09,268
- It's clear.
- Where the hell you been?

589
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:12,238
I'm working on another case.
What'd you expect?

590
00:31:12,238 --> 00:31:13,706
You disappeared.
Where's Shane?

591
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,209
He's working on that hooker
sting I told you about.

592
00:31:16,209 --> 00:31:20,046
Hooker sting? What do they have you
doing now, entrapping johns?

593
00:31:21,047 --> 00:31:22,548
He's just talking with them.

594
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:24,784
Might bring in a few of them later.

595
00:31:25,518 --> 00:31:27,453
Well, you're supposed to
check in every two hours.

596
00:31:28,254 --> 00:31:29,522
Make sure you do.

597
00:31:33,092 --> 00:31:36,896
Asshole's just trying to keep his job.
It's pathetic. Next?

598
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:38,965
Hrach?

599
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:41,934
- Hagop?
- Shit.

600
00:31:41,934 --> 00:31:43,202
You're alive.

601
00:31:45,772 --> 00:31:48,107
- What's going on?
- You need help here?

602
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:52,278
All right. Let's go.

603
00:31:55,214 --> 00:31:57,216
What time were you supposed
to check in with Alex?

604
00:31:58,117 --> 00:32:00,153
What happens to Shane if you don't?

605
00:32:09,061 --> 00:32:10,730
I'm out. I'm out.

606
00:32:11,731 --> 00:32:13,065
I beat him anyway.

607
00:32:17,103 --> 00:32:20,940
Instead of playing poker,
we should be playing poke her.

608
00:32:22,175 --> 00:32:25,278
- Want to play another one?
- Yes.

609
00:32:28,648 --> 00:32:30,416
In exactly 10 seconds
go to the john.

610
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:32,351
Now say, "wrong
number" and hang up.

611
00:32:32,351 --> 00:32:33,486
Wrong number.

612
00:32:46,132 --> 00:32:48,668
Tell you what. This gypsy swill
just goes right through me.

613
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:50,837
Be right back.

614
00:33:29,442 --> 00:33:30,810
Stay still.

615
00:33:32,311 --> 00:33:36,983
Everybody down! Come on! Everybody!
Down! On the floor!

616
00:33:36,983 --> 00:33:41,387
- Get down on the ground!
- You get on the floor! Get down!

617
00:33:42,321 --> 00:33:44,156
- You too!
- Get your hands up!

618
00:33:45,157 --> 00:33:48,461
<i>Lace your hands, put your palms
</i>on top of your head. Do it!

619
00:33:49,795 --> 00:33:51,998
Alex Eznik, you're under arrest.

620
00:33:52,498 --> 00:33:55,768
Shane! Take him. Shane!

621
00:33:56,702 --> 00:33:58,104
- Shane!
- Yes.

622
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,175
How 'bout next time I save your ass?

623
00:34:05,077 --> 00:34:06,178
That's a date.

624
00:34:07,346 --> 00:34:09,515
- Anything I need to know?
- Nothing at all.

625
00:34:09,515 --> 00:34:10,583
Yes.

626
00:34:26,732 --> 00:34:28,000
What are you doing?

627
00:34:29,335 --> 00:34:33,406
Hi. I'm burying a hamster.

628
00:34:33,673 --> 00:34:35,308
Did you just pay that kid for it?

629
00:34:37,243 --> 00:34:40,746
No. I gave him some money
so that he could go buy a new one.

630
00:34:54,427 --> 00:34:56,629
Okay. You know what? I'm going to
have to write you up for this.

631
00:34:56,963 --> 00:35:00,232
- No. You don't.
- Yes. I do.

632
00:35:00,232 --> 00:35:01,801
- Look. It's really not...
- Shut up.

633
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:05,471
Jesus Christ.

634
00:35:05,471 --> 00:35:08,174
All right, ladies.
Move it along. Come on. Let's go.

635
00:35:10,376 --> 00:35:12,411
- Nice bust.
- It's not over yet.

636
00:35:12,411 --> 00:35:14,847
Once these goons lawyer up,
the word'll get out...

637
00:35:14,847 --> 00:35:16,949
...and those places will be cleared
out before we can hit 'em.

638
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:19,485
So let's move now. Give me the
specifics. I'll send units.

639
00:35:20,653 --> 00:35:22,188
We got a chop
shop on Newman.

640
00:35:22,188 --> 00:35:23,823
Cigarette stash on Merrick.
A few others.

641
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:25,691
Something mysterious
on Escovida.

642
00:35:25,691 --> 00:35:26,926
We'll check
that out.

643
00:35:26,926 --> 00:35:28,527
Something to do with
the money train?

644
00:35:28,527 --> 00:35:30,696
It's probably just a jerk-off.
We'll let you know.

645
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,088
Do you think
that's the money train?

646
00:35:56,789 --> 00:35:58,057
I got a pretty good feeling.

647
00:35:58,791 --> 00:35:59,859
So it is real.

648
00:36:11,237 --> 00:36:12,405
What do you want to do?

649
00:36:14,707 --> 00:36:18,477
At the bar, when I didn't answer her
questions, she called me names.

650
00:36:18,477 --> 00:36:20,212
Why didn't you report this earlier?

651
00:36:21,714 --> 00:36:23,416
I don't know.
I didn't know my rights.

652
00:36:23,716 --> 00:36:25,017
But you do now.

653
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:33,459
Mr. Ibish, do you remember
Officer Lowe?

654
00:36:33,893 --> 00:36:35,995
- Yes.
- I remember you too.

655
00:36:36,495 --> 00:36:39,598
My first week on the job.
He resisted arrest, became violent.

656
00:36:39,932 --> 00:36:42,101
My partner exercised
great restraint.

657
00:36:43,002 --> 00:36:45,571
- Did Danny use any racial epithets?
- No, sir.

658
00:36:46,105 --> 00:36:48,040
But Mr. Ibish used one or two
towards me.

659
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,976
He's lying. He's covering for her.
You all do that.

660
00:36:50,976 --> 00:36:54,013
What did Mr. Hamad offer you
to come forward with this story?

661
00:36:55,848 --> 00:36:58,484
If he's retracting his statements now,
it's a surprise to me.

662
00:36:58,484 --> 00:37:00,653
You told him that if he
filed a complaint,...

663
00:37:00,653 --> 00:37:03,089
...you'd represent him for
free in his own civil suit.

664
00:37:03,089 --> 00:37:04,857
That was predicated on
his story being true.

665
00:37:04,857 --> 00:37:06,692
There was no quid pro
quo for him to lie.

666
00:37:06,692 --> 00:37:09,929
Well, either way,
your case ends here.

667
00:37:09,929 --> 00:37:11,497
Our case doesn't
depend on him.

668
00:37:11,497 --> 00:37:13,165
I'm here to discuss
your counteroffer.

669
00:37:13,165 --> 00:37:15,434
Well, here it is. Nothing.

670
00:37:16,535 --> 00:37:18,804
Her own partner won't
corroborate her story.

671
00:37:18,804 --> 00:37:20,439
He doesn't contradict
it either.

672
00:37:20,439 --> 00:37:21,607
We have a wrongful entry...

673
00:37:21,607 --> 00:37:23,509
...an innocent man,
and a grieving widow.

674
00:37:23,509 --> 00:37:25,044
And I've got a
decorated officer...

675
00:37:25,044 --> 00:37:28,114
...who's fighting to keep this city
safe during very troubled times.

676
00:37:29,048 --> 00:37:31,117
I look forward to a jury
settling this.

677
00:37:36,122 --> 00:37:37,223
We'll be in touch.

678
00:37:55,207 --> 00:37:58,577
Washington, Oregon,
Arizona, Nevada.

679
00:37:58,844 --> 00:38:02,715
This isn't just L.A. money.
This is the whole goddamn West Coast.

680
00:38:02,715 --> 00:38:03,849
Holy shit.

681
00:38:04,483 --> 00:38:06,952
First the head of the Zeroun family,
then this.

682
00:38:07,386 --> 00:38:09,555
Aceveda's going to be
licking our scrotums for weeks.

683
00:38:11,056 --> 00:38:13,659
I'll call... I'll call for backup.

684
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:16,061
- No.
- What?

685
00:38:17,696 --> 00:38:19,832
- We're going to let it go.
- Why?

686
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,169
We're going to let it go.

687
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:40,653
Get over here.

688
00:38:42,021 --> 00:38:43,189
Get over here.

689
00:38:51,331 --> 00:38:53,866
- Tell that bitch you lied.
- What?

690
00:38:53,866 --> 00:38:57,937
Tell her you made it up because
you owed me money, wanted to get even.

691
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:00,940
I can't lie anymore.

692
00:39:02,408 --> 00:39:04,210
I got you to take
out Cummings.

693
00:39:04,877 --> 00:39:07,080
You don't think I can arrange
to have your daughter be next?

694
00:39:07,714 --> 00:39:09,449
Use your head.

695
00:39:17,256 --> 00:39:19,125
I didn't need a confession.

696
00:39:21,828 --> 00:39:23,096
But it doesn't hurt.

697
00:39:42,281 --> 00:39:44,550
Vic. We hit the mother lode.

698
00:39:45,485 --> 00:39:47,687
Credit cards, digital cameras,
phony passports.

699
00:39:48,087 --> 00:39:49,522
- What did you find?
- Nothing.

700
00:39:50,089 --> 00:39:51,958
You're the only one
who came up empty?

701
00:39:51,958 --> 00:39:54,394
A case of frostbite,
but, no money train.

702
00:39:55,962 --> 00:39:57,764
You think he gave you
the wrong information?

703
00:39:58,064 --> 00:39:59,632
Either that or it never existed.

704
00:40:01,034 --> 00:40:02,702
What's the matter?
Cage not full enough for you?

705
00:40:02,702 --> 00:40:04,337
So you won't mind
if I check it out.

706
00:40:09,876 --> 00:40:11,177
Why would I mind?

707
00:40:18,751 --> 00:40:19,952
Good work today.

708
00:40:27,226 --> 00:40:28,795
Good enough to get
a chit with you?

709
00:40:29,962 --> 00:40:31,130
What kind
of chit?

710
00:40:31,964 --> 00:40:35,301
I'll take a minority onto my team,
but I get to keep Shane.

711
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:41,874
He's suspended for a week...

712
00:40:42,275 --> 00:40:44,777
...and I get approval
of the new team member.

713
00:40:44,777 --> 00:40:46,646
And I get to approve your approval.

714
00:40:49,015 --> 00:40:50,183
I can live with that.

715
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:52,819
Then I guess we start lookin'.

716
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:01,961
I take it back.

717
00:41:02,295 --> 00:41:04,263
No need to. You were right.

718
00:41:06,165 --> 00:41:07,900
Let me buy you a little dinner.

719
00:41:08,234 --> 00:41:10,737
A detective can't personalize
his investigations.

720
00:41:11,237 --> 00:41:13,439
I'm... I'm not really very hungry.

721
00:41:18,411 --> 00:41:20,613
Hrach says the money train
moves every couple of months.

722
00:41:20,847 --> 00:41:21,881
Where does it go?

723
00:41:22,281 --> 00:41:25,251
Next time?
Right into our pockets.

724
00:41:26,753 --> 00:41:28,221
There's a lot of unknowns.

725
00:41:28,421 --> 00:41:31,190
Well, we can do it right...
Be extra careful...

726
00:41:31,557 --> 00:41:32,925
Take our time.

727
00:41:33,493 --> 00:41:35,995
You can't really be talkin'
about making off...

728
00:41:36,362 --> 00:41:40,166
...with the Armenian mob's
entire Western U.S. kitty.

729
00:41:40,166 --> 00:41:43,469
Goddamn Eastern Euros can't
keep track of their own plutonium.

730
00:41:45,171 --> 00:41:48,040
You think I'm going to trust 'em
with our cold hard cash?

731
00:41:56,649 --> 00:41:58,451
Mr. Hamad dropped my case.

732
00:41:58,451 --> 00:42:00,887
One big city against just me now.

733
00:42:00,887 --> 00:42:03,523
Mrs. Al-Thani, please. I don't want to
have to put you under arrest.

734
00:42:03,523 --> 00:42:07,660
You! Zayed was a good man!
He would never shoot you!

735
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:10,163
And we sympathize
with your loss.

736
00:42:10,163 --> 00:42:11,864
If you did, you would have
signed those papers...

737
00:42:11,864 --> 00:42:15,401
...and given me peace
and a chance for my baby.

738
00:42:15,401 --> 00:42:16,702
Come. Come here.

739
00:42:18,104 --> 00:42:20,706
He will never know his father
because of you.

740
00:42:22,375 --> 00:42:24,110
I'll never forget what you do.

741
00:42:25,144 --> 00:42:26,746
I didn't do anything wrong.

742
00:42:27,213 --> 00:42:28,948
Justice will find you.

743
00:42:40,893 --> 00:42:43,029
Now, you have a king.
She only has a four...

744
00:42:43,029 --> 00:42:44,864
...which means you can take her cards.

745
00:42:45,164 --> 00:42:47,867
See? These cards go over here.

746
00:42:47,867 --> 00:42:50,469
Go ahead.
Move these cards over here.

747
00:42:53,973 --> 00:42:56,175
- Matthew?
- You just have to show him, Dad.

748
00:42:56,609 --> 00:42:57,743
Here.

749
00:43:01,047 --> 00:43:03,449
Birthday cake? Vic.

750
00:43:03,449 --> 00:43:05,918
Well, it's somebody's
birthday... somewhere.

751
00:43:06,419 --> 00:43:08,221
It's time to get ready for bed.
Come on.

752
00:43:08,221 --> 00:43:11,023
Go brush your teeth,
put on your p.j's.

753
00:43:11,023 --> 00:43:12,191
I'm not tired.

754
00:43:12,491 --> 00:43:15,528
You heard your mom. I'll be in
in a second to read you a story.

755
00:43:17,797 --> 00:43:18,898
Go on.

756
00:43:21,667 --> 00:43:23,836
Megan went right to sleep.
No problem.

757
00:43:23,836 --> 00:43:25,271
How are you
feeling?

758
00:43:26,172 --> 00:43:29,041
A little stiff. I'm
okay, not too bad.

759
00:43:30,376 --> 00:43:32,111
First day back at work was good.

760
00:43:33,279 --> 00:43:34,714
It's a little early, isn't it?

761
00:43:35,047 --> 00:43:38,885
These doctors. If they could,
they'd put you on bed rest...

762
00:43:38,885 --> 00:43:40,987
...until you got something else
they could charge you for.

763
00:43:41,854 --> 00:43:43,890
You seemed pretty anxious
to get back.

764
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:46,993
- I have a lot to do.
- It's just that...

765
00:43:47,226 --> 00:43:49,428
...before you got hurt, you...

766
00:43:49,896 --> 00:43:51,364
...you said you'd leave the house.

767
00:43:53,165 --> 00:43:54,267
You promised.

768
00:43:57,904 --> 00:43:59,038
I know.

769
00:44:00,373 --> 00:44:02,375
If you're good enough
to go back to work...

770
00:44:04,343 --> 00:44:06,178
Soon as you can find a place.

771
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,428
What can I do for ya?

772
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:26,299
- I need a room.
- Yes.

773
00:44:33,673 --> 00:44:35,241
You know what? That's fine.

774
00:44:35,241 --> 00:44:40,346
Here, just write your name
and your police division.

775
00:44:43,416 --> 00:44:45,618
Is this about
the people across the street?

776
00:44:47,586 --> 00:44:50,356
- I can't say.
- Okay. Yes. That's...

777
00:44:50,356 --> 00:44:51,590
I understand.

778
00:44:52,224 --> 00:44:54,260
I tell ya. The things
he does to her...

779
00:44:54,627 --> 00:44:55,928
It's a sin.

780
00:44:55,928 --> 00:44:58,397
Why don't you give me a room
with a view across the street?

781
00:45:09,408 --> 00:45:11,177
You know, I might be staying awhile.
