1
00:00:00,767 --> 00:00:02,268
<i>Previously, on The Shield.</i>

2
00:00:02,268 --> 00:00:03,636
You need help.

3
00:00:03,636 --> 00:00:05,105
I can't...

4
00:00:05,772 --> 00:00:07,073
.. be helped.

5
00:00:07,073 --> 00:00:08,842
This is how serious I am!

6
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:10,043
Calm down.

7
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,345
Jesus Christ!

8
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:13,847
What's the matter with you?

9
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,648
I'm your Landlord, Rondell.

10
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:18,885
And you can't follow by my rules,
I'll find someone who can?

11
00:00:18,885 --> 00:00:21,054
Rondell's out. I'm making the change.

12
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:23,089
He's working for a drug dealer?

13
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:25,125
The drug dealer was
working for Mackey.

14
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:26,893
I want you to help him prove it.

15
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:31,998
We killed a cop!

16
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:34,968
Get over it. Don't bring it up again.

17
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:37,504
You accused Big Mackey
working with a drug dealer.

18
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:39,472
- Who's your witness?
- Anonymous tip.

19
00:00:39,472 --> 00:00:41,307
Anyone who can corrobrate it?

20
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:42,942
Call me anytime...

21
00:00:43,843 --> 00:00:46,212
Jesus Christ! What did you do?

22
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,614
Nothing you haven't done.

23
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:50,016
You've been manipulating
police resources...

24
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:52,285
...to crash land value
in this neighborhood?

25
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:54,387
The facts will show that
Assistant Chief Gilroy...

26
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:57,457
...chose a path that led to tragic
circumstances fro this city.

27
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:00,560
(14 months earlier)

28
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:04,230
<i>Store owner says he heard the shots.</i>

29
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,865
<i>He didn't come out to take a look.</i>

30
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:08,334
<i>That make him gutless or smart?</i>

31
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:10,336
<i> Probably a little of both.</i>

32
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:15,408
<i>The D.M.V. says she had a '96
Ford Escort registered to her.</i>

33
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:19,045
You think driving with an escort will
disqualify you from being car-jacked.

34
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:20,880
<i>Where the hell are the tech guys?</i>

35
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,916
A knife fight over on Stanton.

36
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,651
Hurry up and wait time.

37
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:30,857
<i>No. I'm gonna try the gum again.</i>

38
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:32,959
<i>You'll be back
on the tar in a week.</i>

39
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,594
Thanks for your support.

40
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:42,469
Christ almighty, my
whole life is going by.

41
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:43,703
Vic.

42
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,106
Gilroy's in the house.

43
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:51,177
Hey. What brings you
to the front line?

44
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,880
A car jacking at 2:00
in the afternoon.

45
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,850
Yeah, well. Business
as usual on the Farm.

46
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:59,853
Look, I wanted
to talk to you in person.

47
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,024
The command of this new Strike Team.

48
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:09,896
I'm having a hard time
selling you to the chief.

49
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:11,164
Balls!

50
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:15,301
I know the area. I know the players.

51
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,803
No one can do this better than me.

52
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,438
The chief's not looking
for somebody better.

53
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:20,607
He's looking for somebody more...

54
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:23,209
What? What's the problem?

55
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,879
He's worried about all
your run-ins with Plotkin.

56
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:28,781
- Plotkin was an asshole.
- He was your superior.

57
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:31,518
Yeah, and I've done my penance
for a year and a half because of him.

58
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:34,521
I'm never gonna get another shot?

59
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:36,689
Not this one, Vic. I'm sorry.

60
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:46,165
No. I need to get out
on the street, cleaning it up.

61
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:50,870
I mean,
you gotta talk to the chief again.

62
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:53,907
- What?
- You can make it happen.

63
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:56,109
Pull a favour.
Just get me the assignment.

64
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:57,744
<i>Get me Shane on the Strike Team.</i>

65
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:59,312
That's another one
with a spotty jacket.

66
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:00,747
Shane's a good cop.

67
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:02,448
And he works well with me.

68
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:05,418
You can fill the rest of the team
with whoever you like.

69
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,588
Ben, I need this.

70
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:15,094
I've only got one marker
to use with the chief.

71
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:18,464
If it use it, I need results.
I need them quick...

72
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:20,066
...or we're both out of a job.

73
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:21,868
Just give me the chance.

74
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:25,271
The unit's anti-gang, anti-drug.

75
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:29,042
- Your own team, wow.
- I just can't blow it.

76
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,544
- You won't.
- A lot of O. T.

77
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,314
It's more money, but
it's less time with you and the kids.

78
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:36,849
We'll manage.
You have to do this.

79
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:39,452
- Ben picked you, didn't he?
- Yeah.

80
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:42,355
After looking
for any reason not to.

81
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:44,691
And he couldn't find one,
so show him.

82
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:43,983
Can I help you?

83
00:04:45,284 --> 00:04:47,987
I'm Detective Mackey.
I'm running the Strike Team.

84
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:50,957
We're still interviewing
for that position.

85
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:53,326
I hope not.

86
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:55,995
Assistant Chief Gilroy
told me I start tomorrow.

87
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:59,399
I figured I'd settle in early.
Hit the ground running.

88
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,668
Gilroy told you that?

89
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,439
I'm Captain David Aceveda.

90
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:09,575
You said your name was Mackey, right?

91
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:10,743
Yeah.

92
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,547
I read your file.

93
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,852
We have a chance to
do something real special here.

94
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:22,922
Well, you let me know
how I can help.

95
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:39,740
I don't care how you
did it in the past.

96
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,808
But in this house, we're
gonna work together.

97
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:46,480
Special squads, detectives,
uniformed police officers.

98
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,382
We'll help each other
and share information,...

99
00:05:48,382 --> 00:05:50,350
...however and whenever we can.

100
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:53,420
It's the only way that this
satellite precinct can work.

101
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:56,857
I'd like to thank the man
responsible for our new jobs,...

102
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,358
...Assistant Chief Ben Gilroy.

103
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,767
Thank you, Captain.

104
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,837
You all know this unit
is a trial squad.

105
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,941
An expensive one.

106
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:17,678
<i>People say it's a waste
of time and tax dollars.</i>

107
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:19,579
<i>I don't believe that.</i>

108
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:20,948
Let's prove them wrong.

109
00:06:31,658 --> 00:06:34,261
- Thanks, Big Ben.
- Good luck, Vic.

110
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:36,997
<i>Come on, Brent.
I remember you.</i>

111
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:42,336
Sofer, you did your P-2
over at Central?

112
00:06:42,336 --> 00:06:45,205
- Yeah.
- Who sucked you into this hellhole?

113
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:47,941
I couldn't pass up the long hours
and the low pay.

114
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:50,010
<i>- You ready, boot?
- Yes, Ma'am.</i>

115
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,679
- Don't ever call me "ma'am."
- Yes, sir.

116
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:55,182
Just Danny, okay?

117
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:56,817
All right, Danny.

118
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:00,187
I know you two haven't
worked Farmington...

119
00:07:00,187 --> 00:07:01,588
...as much as Shane and I have,...

120
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:04,057
...so I want you to get out
on the street, cultivate C.I.s...

121
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:05,826
...find out who's
hating, who's mating.

122
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:08,362
- Knowledge is power.
- Cool. When do we get started?

123
00:07:08,362 --> 00:07:09,563
Already have.

124
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:12,265
I put a list together of the
neighborhood dickheads.

125
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,867
We're gonna make some house calls.

126
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:15,369
Let them know who's new in town.

127
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:17,738
This is gonna rock, man.
Thanks for letting me join the band.

128
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:19,506
Shane vouched for you.

129
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:21,675
In spite of that, I figured what the hell.

130
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:23,677
Might have been a mistake.

131
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:25,812
Oh, yeah? Who let the guy
with the mustache in?

132
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:28,882
- The ladies love the 'stache.
- Listen, guys.

133
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:31,651
Trust isn't something
that happens overnight.

134
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:34,755
And trust me, where we're going,
we're gonna need it.

135
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:35,889
Yeah.

136
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:40,394
Sorry.

137
00:07:40,394 --> 00:07:44,965
We have a drive-by,
gang-related, one fatality.

138
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,166
That's you.

139
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:53,306
- We're on.
- Let's do it.

140
00:07:57,277 --> 00:08:00,147
- What happened?
- Yo, man, they killed Wanda.

141
00:08:00,781 --> 00:08:02,783
They took Jolene off in an ambulance.

142
00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:05,819
- Polly's shot somewhere.
- Looks like you got off easy.

143
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,255
- Who did it?
- Yo, man, I didn't see him.

144
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:11,458
- What's your name?
- Ringo.

145
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:14,094
Parents didn't like you enough
to name you after John or Paul?

146
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:15,729
No, I know a Ringo.

147
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:18,065
<i>- Oh, yeah?
- Small-time pimp daddy.</i>

148
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:20,200
<i>Who'd you piss off?</i>

149
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:24,571
Yo, man, I was just walkin' with my
girls, mindin' the store. That's all.

150
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,310
I mean in the last couple of days.

151
00:08:33,447 --> 00:08:35,048
No one.

152
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:45,492
Someone's trying
to mark their territory.

153
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,594
Who's the lion?

154
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,166
See what you can
drum up out of Ringo.

155
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,869
I know one of the girls
that works for him. Owes me.

156
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,737
- I'll see if she can help.
- Okay.

157
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:02,409
<i>The classroom's where you learn the
rules, but 70% of the job is instinct.</i>

158
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:05,479
Morning, Jules. Black tea, please.

159
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:07,714
You want anything?

160
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,883
Orange juice
and a breakfast burrito.

161
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,986
- I'll take care of that.
- That's okay, man. On the house.

162
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:15,722
I appreciate that, but I have to pay.

163
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,090
Regulations.

164
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,230
- Five bucks.
- There you go.

165
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:35,809
What's going on?

166
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,485
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

167
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:57,430
Vic.

168
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,132
Can I come in?

169
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:00,534
Sure, yeah.

170
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,472
You taking care of Brian now?

171
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:07,374
He stays with my mom
most of the time.

172
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:10,177
Sometimes she's got this thing
like three, four hours though.

173
00:10:10,177 --> 00:10:11,778
And then you're alone with him?

174
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:15,482
He's fine. I don't fix
while I'm watchin' him.

175
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:19,152
One of Ringo's girls
was killed today.

176
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:20,820
Another one got shot.

177
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:23,757
I heard about Wanda.

178
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:26,026
She was okay.

179
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,197
Any idea who might have done it?

180
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:37,270
Well, you heard it
from somewhere else?

181
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:42,943
- Lionel Phipps or his guys.
- Who is he?

182
00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:45,412
From the neighborhood.
Got his hands in drugs.

183
00:10:45,412 --> 00:10:48,081
Decided he wanted to get
a piece of our asses.

184
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:50,283
Ringo didn't wanna pay the tax.

185
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:52,852
Next thing you know...

186
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,654
Stay away from Ringo.

187
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,823
He's a walking target right now.

188
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,927
<i>That's my mom.</i>

189
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:02,696
<i>Time for me to get to work.</i>

190
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:08,501
If Lionel is the Lion, then what does
that make you, his wives or his cubs?

191
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,471
Who wants to tell us
about the drive-bys this morning?

192
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:14,574
- Stop feeling me up, faggot.
- You getting a hard-on, faggot?

193
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:17,210
Bitch ass!

194
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,579
Hey, hey, hey!

195
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:22,482
Against the wall!

196
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:24,017
Up against the wall!

197
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,685
Man, he's the asshole
who started it, man.

198
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,154
There's also about a dozen
citizens watching us, man.

199
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:30,857
Just one mistake,
that's all it takes.

200
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,259
Look, he's the cocksucker...

201
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:33,760
Who just put
himself on our list.

202
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:36,763
<i>But when the time
is right, understood?</i>

203
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:39,933
Yeah. I'm sorry.

204
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:42,769
All right. Let's wrap them up
and take them home.

205
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:45,805
Get your ass up!

206
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:55,081
- Wagenbach?
- Yeah. Hi, I'm Dutch...

207
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:56,816
- You're two hours late.
- What?

208
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:59,986
- At Sunset, detectives start at 9:00.
- You start here at 7:00.

209
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:03,356
- Yes, sir. I didn't...
- You're lucky there's a desk left.

210
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,992
That's by the kitchen
and the women's restroom.

211
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:07,527
Is there anything else?

212
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:09,329
There was at 7:00.

213
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:13,733
<i>You might as well
make yourself useful.</i>

214
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:16,903
<i>A rape victim led us back to the
vacant building she was held in.</i>

215
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,705
Detectives Gannon and Wyms
are headed there now.

216
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:20,040
- Tom Gannon?
- Do you know him?

217
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,575
Not personally. Everyone knows
he solved Beachwood Canyon.

218
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,711
- I hear he's great.
- He's punctual.

219
00:12:28,515 --> 00:12:30,183
Managed to loose the ropes,...

220
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:32,686
...punch out the window with
her bare hands to get out.

221
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:34,421
There have been other women here.

222
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:37,457
Vacant building, quiet street.

223
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:39,559
Not much chance of witnesses.

224
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,494
Dutch Wagenbach,
Farmington Division.

225
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:44,297
Over here, we just call it
the Farm. Tom Gannon.

226
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:46,333
I know. Beachwood Canyon Slasher.

227
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,803
- Claudette Wyms.
- Wyms?

228
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:52,072
- You been on the force long?
- Long enough.

229
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:54,307
I'm sorry. I just
haven't heard of you.

230
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:55,575
Why would you?

231
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:58,244
I like to keep up on my colleagues.

232
00:12:58,244 --> 00:12:59,879
Follow the bigger cases.

233
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,015
- So, Butch...
- Dutch.

234
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:04,818
We got a Salvadorean illegal,
doesn't speak English,...

235
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:07,587
...won't give her name,
her parents, just her story.

236
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:09,989
- Which is?
- She was kidnapped.

237
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:11,624
Held here by three cholos.

238
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,360
They called somebody for ransom.

239
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,695
Threatened to rape her
if they didn't pay.

240
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:18,365
Called back later, family
didn't have the money yet,...

241
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:19,999
...so they went to town on her.

242
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,836
After they were done,
they tied her up, left.

243
00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:24,304
She managed to escape.

244
00:13:27,707 --> 00:13:30,009
First one to roll
on Lionel gets a free pass.

245
00:13:31,378 --> 00:13:33,012
The rest don't.

246
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:35,615
So who's talking?

247
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:42,122
You don't think I'm gonna get
Lionel with or without you?

248
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,392
Okay.

249
00:13:45,392 --> 00:13:47,727
I'll be back in an hour.

250
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:49,629
<i>See who changes his mind.</i>

251
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:53,032
Screw you!

252
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:58,371
I don't think we're
looking at typical rapists.

253
00:13:58,371 --> 00:14:00,874
Sexual predators are antisocial.

254
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:03,009
They're driven by
inadequacy, not money.

255
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:06,980
Our three will have rap sheets, but
for violent crimes other than rape.

256
00:14:07,414 --> 00:14:10,483
The sexual assault was a punishment
to them, not a proclivity.

257
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,319
Best desk in the house.

258
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:15,688
Right here by the
kitchen, the men's room.

259
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,323
We lucked out.

260
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,826
This isn't an isolated case.

261
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:21,661
Seems like a lot of
illegal immigrants...

262
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:23,997
...have been getting
snatched up on the Farm.

263
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:25,432
Our stats don't show that.

264
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:28,101
The families don't report it.
They just pay.

265
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:33,039
Several people said I should talk
to someone named Jesus Latigo.

266
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,274
Who's he?

267
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:36,209
Well, I don't know, but
I got him coming in.

268
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,510
Great.

269
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,412
That's good work, Wyms,
but I got you beat.

270
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:41,648
I dug up a witness.

271
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:44,317
Says she saw three guys driving
off from the crime scene.

272
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:46,319
So I'm running a partial plate.

273
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:47,754
I'll fill in the boss.

274
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:54,494
So, Tom, when you broke Beachwood,
what made you think the stepbrother?

275
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:57,163
Something just wasn't
right about that kid.

276
00:14:57,163 --> 00:14:59,265
His stepsister was all cut up,...

277
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:00,600
...but he didn't even seem worried...

278
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,203
...about his mother's safety
or his two real sisters.

279
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:04,804
You see, he loved them.

280
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:08,308
Anyone know what the partner
situation is around here?

281
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:10,043
Captain's still working on it.

282
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:12,645
Maybe we could work together.
I could learn a lot from you.

283
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:15,782
Yeah. Well...

284
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:18,084
...maybe it'll end up like that.

285
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:24,324
When I heard what had
happened to Anabel, I was sick.

286
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:26,726
- How did you know her family?
- I'm a friend.

287
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:29,162
Well, we have to talk to them.

288
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:31,965
See what the kidnappers said to them.

289
00:15:31,965 --> 00:15:33,500
They won't come in.

290
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,735
My clients are illegals.
You know how it is.

291
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:37,704
I thought you were a
friend of the family.

292
00:15:37,704 --> 00:15:39,005
I am.

293
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:42,242
Are they also your clients?
Are you a lawyer?

294
00:15:42,242 --> 00:15:44,210
No, no. I'm just a friend.

295
00:15:44,711 --> 00:15:46,012
Everyone I talked to said that...

296
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:48,147
...you're the man to see about
dealing with kidnappers.

297
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:49,649
What does that mean?

298
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,052
I've really said too much.

299
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:57,056
No, you haven't.

300
00:15:57,991 --> 00:16:01,561
Oh, Jesus Christ!
Goddamn it. I didn't mean that.

301
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:03,496
I was told this is the ladies room.

302
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:04,898
I guess it is.

303
00:16:04,898 --> 00:16:08,167
Gannon, you creaky old sack of shit.
What are you doing?

304
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:09,836
Gilroy asked me to do him a favour...

305
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:12,138
...and bring a little credibility
to this old barn.

306
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:14,040
Barn. I like that.

307
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,808
I heard you're running
the Strike Team.

308
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:19,212
- Yeah. They're giving me the shot.
- That's good.

309
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:22,015
Plotkin's probably pissing
blood just thinking about it.

310
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,017
Have you talked to Joe Clarke lately?

311
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:25,618
He's enjoying his retirement.

312
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:27,453
I'm looking forward to it myself.

313
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:28,755
These are my guys now.

314
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:31,958
This is Curtis,
Shane and Ronnie.

315
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,994
- Good, as always.
- Hey.

316
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,596
What are you working on now?

317
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:39,265
Some illegal got gang-banged.

318
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:42,135
The victim's more concerned with
Mommy and Daddy's I.N.S. status...

319
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:43,836
...than catching the pricks
that spooned her.

320
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,171
Who are you partnered up with?

321
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:48,107
That black girl and some Dutch guy.

322
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,443
- Who?
- Come here.

323
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:51,878
Come take a look.

324
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:58,451
I keep hiding his chair on him.

325
00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:00,153
You're starting already?

326
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:01,988
Every house needs a rube.

327
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:03,556
And you're anointing this guy?

328
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:05,758
Oh, yeah. I got the
scoop from Sunset.

329
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:07,927
His wife was a big boozer,...

330
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:10,363
...so he puts her in A.A.,
thinking he's getting her help.

331
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:13,032
And she ends up getting
shtupped by her sponsor.

332
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:18,338
And the kicker is she finally tells
him not only is she leaving him,...

333
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:20,039
...she's having this other guy's kid.

334
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,140
Oh, no, no.

335
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:25,378
Maybe we should
cut him a break then.

336
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:26,779
Nah.

337
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:31,818
My guy says that Dutch-boy
is just a big windbag,...

338
00:17:31,818 --> 00:17:33,219
...needs his sails trimmed.

339
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:38,124
- Doesn't anyone knock?
- This one's Wyms.

340
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,593
- Hello.
- Hello.

341
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,329
I got someone in interrogation.

342
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:44,530
Who?

343
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,999
Why don't you come
upstairs and find out?

344
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:47,567
Yeah, I'll be right there.

345
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:52,972
All business.

346
00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:54,641
She'll never last around here.

347
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:03,583
- This ain't gonna work.
- What do you mean?

348
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,818
There's not enough oxygen
in there for the three of us.

349
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:07,186
- Fletch, you hang back.

350
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:09,622
- We'll tell you how it goes.
- Sure.

351
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:13,660
Mr. Latigo, this is
my partner, Tom Gannon.

352
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:20,900
There's just one
cage here, right?

353
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:25,271
Excuse me. Where did
our prisoners go?

354
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,340
- The captain released them.
- Why?

355
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,908
Ask him.

356
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,515
- Captain, I have a question.
- Yes?

357
00:18:35,515 --> 00:18:37,583
Well, I was just wondering...

358
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,420
...why you cut my prisoners loose
without checking with me.

359
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,789
I saw the paperwork.
It was a mess.

360
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:44,490
There was no probable cause.

361
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,959
The D.A. wouldn't have taken
the case, so I let them go.

362
00:18:47,694 --> 00:18:48,961
Maybe you'll remember this...

363
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,797
...the next time you turn in
such sloppy paperwork.

364
00:18:51,898 --> 00:18:53,900
I wasn't looking for a conviction.

365
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,468
I was just sweatin' them.

366
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:58,571
It's a holding cell,
Detective, not a sauna.

367
00:18:58,571 --> 00:19:00,840
It's reserved for
legitimate, actual arrests.

368
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,608
They were part of my
murder investigation.

369
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:05,011
What investigation?
I haven't seen anything of merit.

370
00:19:05,011 --> 00:19:06,779
Where are the suspects?
Where are the leads?

371
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:08,214
You sent them off packing.

372
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:14,320
Commanding the Strike Team
is a prized position.

373
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:17,924
We had a lot of candidates
just as qualified, if not more.

374
00:19:17,924 --> 00:19:20,727
So get your act together,
or I'll find someone else.

375
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,163
Are we clear?

376
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:27,266
Yes, sir.

377
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,408
How's the first day going?

378
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:37,977
A few bugs,
but I'm working them out.

379
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:40,313
Anything I should know about?

380
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:44,617
Your guy Mackey, he's not off
to a very impressive start.

381
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:46,519
- He'll get results.
- Maybe.

382
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,654
But I'd like to put a
backup plan in place.

383
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:52,358
Fill the last open slot
with a guy who could...

384
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:54,660
...run the Strike Team
if Mackey flunked out.

385
00:19:55,461 --> 00:19:57,930
Give the man a chance,
David. It's day one.

386
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:01,134
I've read his file,
called around.

387
00:20:01,134 --> 00:20:03,035
A lot of people
won't work with him.

388
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,672
It's a crucial slot.
We can do better.

389
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:10,309
I need this experiment
to be successful.

390
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:11,811
So do you.

391
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:13,913
Then we need someone who can deliver.

392
00:20:15,248 --> 00:20:16,749
He will.

393
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:22,088
Come up with some candidates
though, just in case.

394
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:24,457
I'll pick somebody personally.

395
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:27,527
No, come up with a few guys,
run them through my office.

396
00:20:27,527 --> 00:20:30,530
- You shouldn't have to be bothered.
- It's too important.

397
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,965
I'm making all personnel
decisions around here.

398
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,369
Just keep an eye on things.
I'll be in touch later.

399
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:45,211
<i>Hey.</i>

400
00:20:51,651 --> 00:20:53,619
Heard about your spat
with Aceveda.

401
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:56,055
Aw, we're just getting
used to each other.

402
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:57,990
No time for a learning curve, Vic.

403
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:00,693
The chief gave me
everything I wanted here,...

404
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:02,695
...but I had to take on Aceveda.

405
00:21:03,196 --> 00:21:04,997
He's not going anywhere.

406
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:07,233
Now, do you have leads
on this drive-by or not?

407
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:11,270
Hell, yeah. We think this street thug
named Lionel is behind it.

408
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:14,040
Then make your case, and put
the Strike Team on the map.

409
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,742
We will. Just might need
a little more time.

410
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:18,811
The chief's not gonna
have any patience.

411
00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:20,379
Which means I don't either.

412
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:23,249
We clear?

413
00:21:30,823 --> 00:21:33,860
The people I've talked to
say you're a ransom broker.

414
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:38,331
Detaining someone is a heinous crime,
but very lucrative in Latin America.

415
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:40,933
Detain, my ass. You're
a goddamn kidnapper.

416
00:21:40,933 --> 00:21:42,435
I'm a consultant.

417
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:44,403
The kidnappers demand a ransom.

418
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:46,672
The families hire me
to broker the deal,...

419
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:48,274
...get their loved ones back safely.

420
00:21:48,274 --> 00:21:50,409
And you do this out of the
goodness of your heart?

421
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:51,911
I charge a commission.

422
00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:54,113
I have a 100% recovery rate.

423
00:21:54,113 --> 00:21:56,215
'Cause your buddies are the
ones doing the kidnapping.

424
00:21:56,215 --> 00:21:59,218
No. Because I understand how to
negotiate with these people.

425
00:21:59,218 --> 00:22:00,553
The Salvadoreans do not.

426
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:02,121
Negotiate with what people?

427
00:22:02,121 --> 00:22:03,789
Mexicans.

428
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:06,158
They see the Salvadoreans
as lower class.

429
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,526
They target them.

430
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:09,729
- And what are you?
- Honduran.

431
00:22:09,729 --> 00:22:12,064
So, look, where are
these kidnappers now?

432
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:14,033
I've never met them.
We arrange a drop.

433
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:15,668
How do you contact them?

434
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:17,236
They page me to a pay phone.

435
00:22:17,236 --> 00:22:19,372
Next time they page you, you tell us.

436
00:22:19,372 --> 00:22:20,640
Look.

437
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,911
I'm successful because the families
and the kidnappers both trust me.

438
00:22:24,911 --> 00:22:28,347
I lead you to these men. All the
others will never work with me again.

439
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:31,017
If there were no more brokers,
it would be harder to do business...

440
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:32,718
...and maybe the
kidnappings would stop.

441
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:34,587
Oh, no.
There'll always be kidnappings.

442
00:22:34,587 --> 00:22:37,390
And the families will hire
other brokers who don't care.

443
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:39,759
Brokers who take
the money and keep it.

444
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:42,495
And the kidnappers
will kill the victims.

445
00:22:42,495 --> 00:22:45,298
And the broker says,
"That's just the way it goes."

446
00:22:45,298 --> 00:22:47,500
Well, I care. I pay the money.

447
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,502
I get people back alive.

448
00:22:49,502 --> 00:22:51,971
Look, are you gonna lead us
to these guys or not?

449
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,307
I can't.

450
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,376
Talk to me.

451
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:01,213
We wait a couple of weeks.

452
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,449
We wait till one of Lionel's
guys slips up on some felony.

453
00:23:03,449 --> 00:23:04,750
And then we flip him.

454
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,585
We don't have a couple of weeks.

455
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:08,421
Lem and I spoke
to Narcotics and Vice.

456
00:23:08,421 --> 00:23:10,656
They've been trying to make a
case against Lionel for months.

457
00:23:10,656 --> 00:23:11,857
They're at a dead end.

458
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:13,926
- They have nothing for us?
- That's what they said.

459
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:16,329
God!

460
00:23:18,998 --> 00:23:21,567
We gotta nail him,
like right now.

461
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:22,969
Okay, so we keep at him.

462
00:23:22,969 --> 00:23:25,471
We hit him long enough and hard
enough, he'll get the message.

463
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:27,306
You an expert on making
guys long and hard?

464
00:23:27,306 --> 00:23:29,275
Hey, this isn't funny.

465
00:23:31,043 --> 00:23:33,546
I mean, it's the goddamn first day,...

466
00:23:33,546 --> 00:23:36,048
...and the bosses are already
talking about making changes.

467
00:23:36,048 --> 00:23:38,451
Anybody here feel like
going back to their old post?

468
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,567
Look, I hate
to say this, but...

469
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:57,603
...I think we need a shortcut.

470
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:01,440
Like what?

471
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:06,612
Maybe we need to squeeze a
guy in Lionel's outfit.

472
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:09,115
Make him produce some
evidence for us.

473
00:24:15,421 --> 00:24:17,089
That'd speed things up a bit.

474
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:20,559
Produce as in plant?

475
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:25,765
Hey, we all know that this guy's
an asshole in the first degree.

476
00:24:25,765 --> 00:24:28,768
It's for goddamn sure this isn't
the first body he's responsible for.

477
00:24:28,768 --> 00:24:30,469
- I don't know, man.
- You just hear me out.

478
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:35,408
A high-profile bust
gets us credibility...

479
00:24:35,408 --> 00:24:37,743
...out on the street and
with the bosses.

480
00:24:37,743 --> 00:24:39,645
Once we get our feet
on solid ground,...

481
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:41,480
...get a couple of wins
under our belt,...

482
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,349
...we go back to doing it
the right way.

483
00:24:45,551 --> 00:24:47,153
Hey, we need this.

484
00:24:51,023 --> 00:24:52,458
Just this once.

485
00:25:00,066 --> 00:25:01,701
Hey, where we goin'?

486
00:25:01,701 --> 00:25:03,236
Ain't no police station this way.

487
00:25:03,236 --> 00:25:05,304
Yeah, well, we a mobile unit.

488
00:25:05,304 --> 00:25:07,473
Why you in such a hurry
to go to jail anyway?

489
00:25:07,473 --> 00:25:09,442
Bringin' me in for a
couple of joints, man?

490
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:12,445
I ain't doin' time
for no three sticks of chronic.

491
00:25:12,445 --> 00:25:14,247
With your record,
I wouldn't be too sure.

492
00:25:15,248 --> 00:25:17,750
You're gonna help us
build a case against Lionel.

493
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,285
Are you on the pipe?

494
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,221
You see that?

495
00:25:22,221 --> 00:25:24,190
We had our own tagger do some work.

496
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:26,059
We're the new king of this jungle.

497
00:25:26,292 --> 00:25:28,761
You think paintin'a snake on
the wall makes you top dog?

498
00:25:28,761 --> 00:25:30,296
Wanna go back for possession?

499
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:34,734
You guys may be the cops,
but Lionel's the law around here.

500
00:25:35,101 --> 00:25:37,804
You gotta bring it a lot heavier
than this to change people's minds.

501
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:49,315
- I don't think he's gonna cooperate.
- Give it time.

502
00:25:49,315 --> 00:25:51,484
- If he doesn't?
- I'm thinking.

503
00:25:53,386 --> 00:25:56,122
You know what? Screw Rondell.
We'll just try another homie.

504
00:25:56,122 --> 00:25:58,491
- Lionel will catch wind of it.
- Can't stake him out.

505
00:25:58,491 --> 00:26:00,093
He's smart.

506
00:26:00,493 --> 00:26:03,496
If we bring him in for piddley shit,
Captain Ass will just kick him.

507
00:26:03,496 --> 00:26:06,132
Why don't we get a warrant based
on suspicion of the shooting?

508
00:26:06,132 --> 00:26:08,101
We drop the evidence ourselves.

509
00:26:08,101 --> 00:26:10,903
Lionel will scream "setup." And that's
exactly what it will look like.

510
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:13,439
It can't even remotely appear
like we brought the shit in.

511
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:16,075
No, we've gotta have
another cop find it.

512
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:18,277
How about planting it in his car?

513
00:26:19,045 --> 00:26:21,914
Crib's the best bet.
When's it empty?

514
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:25,251
It isn't. He's got girls streaming
in and out of there day and night.

515
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:33,292
We don't need you
to tell us when they call.

516
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:35,128
We'll just wait, get
the page ourselves.

517
00:26:35,128 --> 00:26:36,362
No, they use a code.

518
00:26:36,362 --> 00:26:38,998
Without me, the number
won't make any sense.

519
00:26:38,998 --> 00:26:41,167
I tried to interrogate our victim
again. She still won't talk.

520
00:26:41,167 --> 00:26:44,036
They don't trust the police.
That's why they come to me for help.

521
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:45,838
I do this community a service.

522
00:26:45,838 --> 00:26:47,473
It's not just about the money.

523
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:50,476
I help families pro bono...

524
00:26:50,476 --> 00:26:52,311
Cut the champion
of the people crap.

525
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:56,516
- So what happened?
- Mayfield Duffy...

526
00:26:56,516 --> 00:26:59,385
...pushed a cart full of groceries
out of the store without paying.

527
00:26:59,385 --> 00:27:01,554
When my husband went to
stop him, he got attacked.

528
00:27:01,554 --> 00:27:03,589
- What did he hit you with?
- A bag of ice.

529
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:07,393
- Go call the paramedics.
- Mayfield is okay.

530
00:27:07,393 --> 00:27:09,796
He just had a bad run.
No work.

531
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:11,697
He said he will pay
for the stuff later.

532
00:27:11,697 --> 00:27:13,733
I told him we don't do that.

533
00:27:13,733 --> 00:27:15,468
No money, no groceries.

534
00:27:17,403 --> 00:27:20,406
Look, I don't wanna get
Mayfield in no trouble.

535
00:27:20,406 --> 00:27:22,942
I just want the money
or the groceries back.

536
00:27:22,942 --> 00:27:25,611
Well, sir, he committed a felony.
We're gonna have to arrest him.

537
00:27:25,611 --> 00:27:27,914
Well, then go do it.
He took perishables.

538
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:39,892
- Yeah?
- Step out of the apartment, please.

539
00:27:42,295 --> 00:27:43,896
- You Mayfield Duffy?
- Yeah.

540
00:27:43,896 --> 00:27:45,097
Step down, please, sir.

541
00:27:45,097 --> 00:27:47,266
Hands out of your pockets,
sir, and behind your head.

542
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:49,535
- What's the beef?
- Turn around.

543
00:27:49,535 --> 00:27:52,705
- I told him I'd pay him.
- Before or after you struck him?

544
00:27:52,705 --> 00:27:54,974
Is Otto okay? I didn't
mean to hit him hard.

545
00:27:54,974 --> 00:27:56,375
Yeah, he's okay.

546
00:27:56,843 --> 00:27:58,711
Second set of cuffs.

547
00:27:58,711 --> 00:28:01,280
You know there are places where
you can go for aid, sir.

548
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,350
- I got aid. Then I got robbed.
- Robbed?

549
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,285
I get food stamps twice a month.

550
00:28:06,285 --> 00:28:08,154
That punk gangster in 29...

551
00:28:08,154 --> 00:28:11,190
...keeps breaking into the mailbox
and stealing everybody's food stamps.

552
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,159
It will be days before
I can get some more.

553
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:15,027
Meanwhile, my family's starving.

554
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,896
What am I supposed to do?

555
00:28:16,896 --> 00:28:18,497
Not commit a felony.

556
00:28:19,098 --> 00:28:20,600
Use this purse.

557
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,603
It's got a false bottom
and a remote mike inside.

558
00:28:23,603 --> 00:28:25,805
- What's that, coke?
- Crack.

559
00:28:25,805 --> 00:28:27,974
The sentencing is more severe.
Give me your purse.

560
00:28:27,974 --> 00:28:29,308
Come on.

561
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,016
I want you to go inside
Lionel's apartment.

562
00:28:37,016 --> 00:28:39,919
You tell him that you're willing
to pay a street tax...

563
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,255
...to stay out
working and stay safe.

564
00:28:42,255 --> 00:28:43,589
I don't even know this guy.

565
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:44,957
He knows about you.

566
00:28:44,957 --> 00:28:47,460
You hide the crack in his bathroom,
under the sink or something.

567
00:28:48,127 --> 00:28:49,962
This is the guy who shot up Wanda?

568
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:52,231
It'll be a pleasure then.

569
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:54,400
Hey, hey. You're miked.

570
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,701
We can hear everything.

571
00:28:55,701 --> 00:28:58,437
If at any time the mike fails,
we'll be in there, okay?

572
00:28:58,437 --> 00:28:59,872
- Okay.
- Listen.

573
00:29:00,373 --> 00:29:01,574
This guy is bad.

574
00:29:01,574 --> 00:29:04,210
If it seems dangerous, you
just say the word "gringo."

575
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:06,045
Then we come
riding to the rescue.

576
00:29:06,045 --> 00:29:07,680
- Gringo?
- Yeah.

577
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,115
Right.

578
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,286
Hey. I mean it.

579
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:15,922
Any sign of worry, you say the word.

580
00:29:25,665 --> 00:29:27,466
You Happy Sandez?

581
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,702
Yeah, that's me. What of it?

582
00:29:29,702 --> 00:29:31,137
You the same Happy Sandez...

583
00:29:31,137 --> 00:29:32,905
...that's been breaking into
people's mailboxes...

584
00:29:32,905 --> 00:29:34,840
- stealing their food stamps?
- Food stamps?

585
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,475
I don't need no ghetto coupons.

586
00:29:36,475 --> 00:29:38,277
Happy, we got your sheet, man.

587
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:41,180
You got three priors
for theft and no job.

588
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:43,749
Why don't you give those people their
food stamps back so they can eat?

589
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,918
I'm missing the game.

590
00:29:47,787 --> 00:29:49,555
I tell you what, Happy.

591
00:29:49,555 --> 00:29:53,125
My partner and I are gonna go around
the corner for exactly two minutes.

592
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:54,727
And when we come back,...

593
00:29:54,727 --> 00:29:57,763
...either the food stamps you took
are sitting on that bottom step,...

594
00:29:57,763 --> 00:29:59,498
...or I'm gonna call
some detectives down here...

595
00:29:59,498 --> 00:30:01,667
...and they're gonna turn
your life upside down.

596
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:03,069
You got it?

597
00:30:04,704 --> 00:30:06,238
You got two minutes.

598
00:30:08,774 --> 00:30:11,711
<i>Screw Ringo. I'm willing to pay you.</i>

599
00:30:11,711 --> 00:30:13,179
<i>I don't wanna get shot up.</i>

600
00:30:13,179 --> 00:30:14,914
<i>Smart thinkin', sweet pea.</i>

601
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:19,285
<i>- So are we cool then?
- Nah, not quite.</i>

602
00:30:19,285 --> 00:30:21,754
<i>See, I like to know what I'm
puttin' on the streets.</i>

603
00:30:21,754 --> 00:30:23,522
<i>Come here. Right here.</i>

604
00:30:23,522 --> 00:30:25,791
- He wants to taste the kitty.
- <i>Sure.</i>

605
00:30:25,791 --> 00:30:27,893
<i>- Just let me run to the bathroom.
- What for?</i>

606
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:29,895
<i>To pop in my diaphragm.</i>

607
00:30:30,463 --> 00:30:33,899
<i>No need, baby girl.
I ain't hitting that raw.</i>

608
00:30:39,405 --> 00:30:42,241
<i>- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, God.</i>

609
00:30:42,241 --> 00:30:44,643
The broker is a pipeline,
but he's decent.

610
00:30:44,643 --> 00:30:46,779
If we talk to him
the right way, he'll talk.

611
00:30:46,779 --> 00:30:48,247
That broker is a dead end.

612
00:30:48,247 --> 00:30:50,850
I got my witness coming in.
I think she's our best bet.

613
00:30:51,717 --> 00:30:53,652
You know, I got
30 years experience says...

614
00:30:53,652 --> 00:30:56,389
...if we slap this broker
with obstruction of justice,...

615
00:30:56,389 --> 00:30:58,691
...he misses one home-cooked meal,
he'll talk.

616
00:31:03,262 --> 00:31:05,197
Tom's got seniority. Follow his lead.

617
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:06,599
The witness is here.

618
00:31:08,167 --> 00:31:10,369
- Hi. I'm Detective Gannon.
- Carry on.

619
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:17,710
So, hypothetically,...

620
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,612
...how would you go
after the broker?

621
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:23,215
The boss wants to do it
Gannon's way.

622
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:24,917
And he's going his way.

623
00:31:24,917 --> 00:31:26,786
Doesn't mean we can't go ours.

624
00:31:39,065 --> 00:31:41,000
They teach you that in the classroom?

625
00:31:43,436 --> 00:31:46,238
<i>Goddamn, you're tight.</i>

626
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:47,740
<i>Oh, God.</i>

627
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:56,449
<i>- You ain't gonna dis me again, right?
- No, I swear.</i>

628
00:31:56,449 --> 00:31:57,683
<i>Right?</i>

629
00:31:57,683 --> 00:31:59,485
- I'm going in.
- Hey, hey, hey.

630
00:31:59,485 --> 00:32:01,220
She didn't say gringo.

631
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:04,557
- I'm going.
- Hey! We don't have a warrant.

632
00:32:04,557 --> 00:32:07,460
And we're only gonna get
one shot at this. All right?

633
00:32:12,631 --> 00:32:13,866
I don't care.

634
00:32:13,866 --> 00:32:15,868
Hey, god-goddamn it!

635
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:20,539
Hey, hey, hey.
Come on, man. Hey.

636
00:32:21,006 --> 00:32:22,208
She's a pro.

637
00:32:23,042 --> 00:32:24,777
This is what she does for a living.

638
00:32:25,377 --> 00:32:27,146
We gotta make this case, right?

639
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,515
<i>Right?</i>

640
00:32:46,432 --> 00:32:48,034
Oh, for God's sake.

641
00:32:48,034 --> 00:32:50,803
Hey, Vic. Come here.

642
00:32:50,803 --> 00:32:55,408
Hey, look. We're almost there
now, right? All right?

643
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:14,894
It's in the bathroom,
under the sink.

644
00:33:16,496 --> 00:33:17,930
God.

645
00:33:19,732 --> 00:33:21,267
Vic, I'm okay.

646
00:33:32,178 --> 00:33:33,613
Vic.

647
00:33:34,647 --> 00:33:37,450
I need to score
before you take me home.

648
00:33:44,023 --> 00:33:46,559
- Nice digs, David.
- Nice enough.

649
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,127
You don't sound too excited.

650
00:33:48,661 --> 00:33:50,329
No, I am.

651
00:33:50,329 --> 00:33:51,831
It's just...

652
00:33:52,765 --> 00:33:55,368
Gilroy's stocked the pond
with his own fish.

653
00:33:55,368 --> 00:33:57,770
I'm still figuring out
what waters are safe to swim in.

654
00:33:59,005 --> 00:34:00,940
I could use
a friendly face working here.

655
00:34:03,242 --> 00:34:04,744
Is this gonna be like
the time you tried...

656
00:34:04,744 --> 00:34:06,579
...to get me to work
Narcotics in the Valley?

657
00:34:06,579 --> 00:34:08,347
- It'll be different.
- How?

658
00:34:08,881 --> 00:34:10,383
You'll say yes.

659
00:34:10,616 --> 00:34:12,151
I'm happy in Robbery.

660
00:34:12,151 --> 00:34:14,520
This is more money,
more action, more fun.

661
00:34:16,055 --> 00:34:17,323
So what's the job?

662
00:34:17,323 --> 00:34:20,426
Gilroy's pick for the
Strike Team, Vic Mackey.

663
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:26,632
There's a spot on the team.

664
00:34:26,632 --> 00:34:27,934
Take it.

665
00:34:27,934 --> 00:34:30,002
If Mackey doesn't work out,...

666
00:34:30,002 --> 00:34:31,504
...you'll take his place.

667
00:34:31,504 --> 00:34:32,972
Run the Strike Team?

668
00:34:32,972 --> 00:34:35,341
Even if he does work out,
it's still a great gig.

669
00:34:40,279 --> 00:34:42,982
Come on. It's a no-lose
situation for you.

670
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:48,755
Your boy's going down tonight.

671
00:34:49,422 --> 00:34:52,425
The question is
are you going down with him?

672
00:34:53,392 --> 00:34:55,495
Lionel's got drugs in his crib.

673
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:59,866
- Lionel don't keep drugs at his crib.
- I guess he got sloppy.

674
00:35:00,533 --> 00:35:01,901
Makes me wonder.

675
00:35:04,403 --> 00:35:05,972
You ever get sloppy?

676
00:35:08,274 --> 00:35:09,742
You wouldn't.

677
00:35:11,511 --> 00:35:13,179
Aw, shit!

678
00:35:13,546 --> 00:35:16,883
So we busted Rondell here
on possession for distribution.

679
00:35:16,883 --> 00:35:19,519
- He wants to deal now.
- What can you offer us?

680
00:35:19,852 --> 00:35:21,420
My boss, Lionel.

681
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,189
We think he did the drive-bys.

682
00:35:23,189 --> 00:35:24,957
I made deliveries to his house.

683
00:35:24,957 --> 00:35:27,460
He's got product there. You gotta
move on him right away though.

684
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,595
And you're willing to swear
to this in an affidavit?

685
00:35:29,595 --> 00:35:31,464
Sure.
Whatever it takes.

686
00:35:37,637 --> 00:35:39,672
Detective Vendrell,
let's take his statement.

687
00:35:39,672 --> 00:35:40,973
Call for a warrant.

688
00:35:45,044 --> 00:35:47,146
- Impressive.
- Thanks.

689
00:35:47,713 --> 00:35:50,116
Getting him to roll
on a heavy hitter...

690
00:35:50,116 --> 00:35:52,718
...for a misdemeanor
marijuana charge.

691
00:35:52,718 --> 00:35:54,987
I can't take all the credit.

692
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:56,622
I don't think he fully grasps...

693
00:35:56,622 --> 00:35:59,091
...the distinction between
felony and misdemeanor.

694
00:35:59,091 --> 00:36:00,760
When that paperwork comes in,...

695
00:36:01,527 --> 00:36:03,329
...I'd like to go
on that bust with you.

696
00:36:03,896 --> 00:36:05,198
See you in action.

697
00:36:06,699 --> 00:36:07,967
Sure thing.

698
00:36:11,103 --> 00:36:14,540
Your pager just went off.
I know we don't have much time.

699
00:36:14,807 --> 00:36:17,109
Sorry. I'm bound by tradition.

700
00:36:17,109 --> 00:36:20,413
This tradition does it always
include multiple rape?

701
00:36:20,413 --> 00:36:22,181
No, that was wrong of them.

702
00:36:22,181 --> 00:36:25,117
What if the kidnappers decide
the family owes them money?

703
00:36:25,117 --> 00:36:26,619
They could go after her again.

704
00:36:26,619 --> 00:36:27,887
They probably will.

705
00:36:27,887 --> 00:36:29,722
I see how you're being honorable.

706
00:36:29,722 --> 00:36:31,691
You tell me how they're
being honorable.

707
00:36:32,892 --> 00:36:34,961
Look, if you helped us though,
if you led us to them,...

708
00:36:34,961 --> 00:36:36,462
...it would be a message to them...

709
00:36:36,462 --> 00:36:38,998
...that the brokers are not the only
ones who have to follow the rules.

710
00:36:38,998 --> 00:36:40,433
So do the kidnappers.

711
00:36:40,867 --> 00:36:42,802
Your community
would understand that.

712
00:36:42,802 --> 00:36:44,737
They could appreciate
the honor in it.

713
00:36:49,141 --> 00:36:52,278
Informant? Yo, who the hell
told you I got drugs?

714
00:36:52,278 --> 00:36:54,714
That's confidential
for security reasons.

715
00:36:54,714 --> 00:36:55,982
I'm sure you understand.

716
00:36:55,982 --> 00:36:57,783
Yo, don't play me, dog.

717
00:36:58,317 --> 00:36:59,719
I've got a right to face my accuser.

718
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:01,420
You can mention that at trial.

719
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:04,056
Hey, yo, man.
Take it easy over there.

720
00:37:04,056 --> 00:37:06,659
Hey, you heard the man.
Respect the property.

721
00:37:06,659 --> 00:37:08,060
Got something.

722
00:37:10,596 --> 00:37:14,267
Whoa. How many years
of experience in this room...

723
00:37:14,267 --> 00:37:17,436
...and the goddamn rookie finds
the brick on his first day.

724
00:37:17,436 --> 00:37:19,705
- Let me see that, man.
- Nice.

725
00:37:19,705 --> 00:37:22,074
Yeah, damn straight.
The kid's a natural.

726
00:37:22,074 --> 00:37:25,144
- I taught him everything he knows.
- I'll bet you did.

727
00:37:25,144 --> 00:37:26,612
Yo, that ain't mine, man.

728
00:37:26,612 --> 00:37:28,481
This is a stone-cold setup.

729
00:37:28,481 --> 00:37:31,083
- You put it there.
- Found it under your sink, sir.

730
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:32,551
Well, this is a goddamn setup, man.

731
00:37:32,551 --> 00:37:34,120
Vic, Vic.

732
00:37:35,154 --> 00:37:37,223
- Check this shit out.
- That's a TAC-9.

733
00:37:37,223 --> 00:37:38,991
It's the same kind of gun
used in the drive-by.

734
00:37:38,991 --> 00:37:40,259
We plant this too?

735
00:37:40,259 --> 00:37:41,994
Yo, look.
I didn't shoot nobody.

736
00:37:42,261 --> 00:37:44,764
Is that what ballistics is gonna
tell us about that dead hooker?

737
00:37:47,967 --> 00:37:49,435
I didn't think so.

738
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:17,096
- I have 10 minutes to get there.
- We better hurry.

739
00:38:18,164 --> 00:38:20,032
Just get in the cage.

740
00:38:20,366 --> 00:38:21,701
Good work, Vic.

741
00:38:21,701 --> 00:38:23,703
You know, you really
pulled it together.

742
00:38:24,503 --> 00:38:26,639
- Thanks.
- The chief's happy.

743
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:29,909
He wants another press conference
to trumpet the quick results.

744
00:38:29,909 --> 00:38:32,144
I'll do most of the talking,
but he wants you there too.

745
00:38:32,144 --> 00:38:33,346
Sure.

746
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:36,182
Detective. We got a call
from our kidnappers.

747
00:38:36,182 --> 00:38:37,450
We set up a drop.

748
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:38,851
You mind getting our backs?

749
00:38:38,851 --> 00:38:41,354
The captain said we could
help each other out.

750
00:38:41,354 --> 00:38:43,456
Hey, my day's
just getting started.

751
00:39:24,497 --> 00:39:26,032
Shut up!

752
00:39:26,399 --> 00:39:28,834
Get down. Stop!

753
00:39:28,834 --> 00:39:31,103
Get back here!
Stop, goddamn it!

754
00:39:31,103 --> 00:39:33,873
- Down. Hands behind your back.
- Where do you think you're going?

755
00:39:34,874 --> 00:39:36,042
You got him cuffed?

756
00:39:38,411 --> 00:39:40,046
I said stop!

757
00:39:47,887 --> 00:39:49,221
Goddamn it!

758
00:39:56,462 --> 00:39:58,731
All right, we're secure here.

759
00:40:02,868 --> 00:40:05,538
- You all right?
- I got him.

760
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,622
Keep looking.

761
00:40:29,662 --> 00:40:32,665
- That's them.
- Which ones?

762
00:40:32,966 --> 00:40:34,434
Those ones.

763
00:40:36,903 --> 00:40:38,338
Hey, what happened?

764
00:40:40,573 --> 00:40:42,542
Latigo had a change of heart.

765
00:40:42,542 --> 00:40:44,744
- You didn't tell me that.
- It happened quickly.

766
00:40:44,744 --> 00:40:46,379
I've been sitting right here.

767
00:40:48,247 --> 00:40:50,049
Those our kidnappers?

768
00:40:50,249 --> 00:40:51,718
Well,...

769
00:40:51,718 --> 00:40:54,220
...our broker cooperated,
led us to them.

770
00:40:55,822 --> 00:40:57,223
Well done.

771
00:40:59,892 --> 00:41:01,427
Thanks.

772
00:41:04,731 --> 00:41:06,499
You didn't have to do that.

773
00:41:07,166 --> 00:41:08,901
Credit's overrated.

774
00:41:14,374 --> 00:41:17,677
Tangible results.
Nice goddamn job.

775
00:41:19,078 --> 00:41:22,949
Both of you, really.
I told you he'd deliver.

776
00:41:22,949 --> 00:41:24,917
I just didn't think
twice on the first day.

777
00:41:24,917 --> 00:41:26,519
What did you expect?

778
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:28,488
The whole team worked well together.

779
00:41:29,255 --> 00:41:32,225
Some things could have been
smoother, but we'll get there.

780
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:37,196
I'm sure his public defender
will have some questions.

781
00:41:37,964 --> 00:41:39,799
It's just a few scratches.

782
00:41:39,799 --> 00:41:41,768
From being dragged
through barbed wire.

783
00:41:42,669 --> 00:41:44,237
I told him to stop.

784
00:41:44,771 --> 00:41:46,639
Bet you next time he listens.

785
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,841
Come on, fellas.

786
00:41:49,142 --> 00:41:52,111
The job's hard enough without
tension between the walls.

787
00:41:52,111 --> 00:41:53,579
We should be celebrating.

788
00:41:58,685 --> 00:42:00,253
Yeah.

789
00:42:06,025 --> 00:42:08,094
Nathan, you gotta be kidding me.

790
00:42:08,094 --> 00:42:09,829
What am I supposed to do now?

791
00:42:09,829 --> 00:42:12,331
- Use the ladies room.
- Jesus Christ.

792
00:42:12,331 --> 00:42:15,468
Relax. The plumber promised
me he'd get to it tomorrow.

793
00:42:15,468 --> 00:42:17,336
Try not to destroy that one too.

794
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:23,376
The obvious thing would have
been to go Gannon's way.

795
00:42:23,376 --> 00:42:24,744
Instead, you got Latigo to do...

796
00:42:24,744 --> 00:42:27,280
...exactly what he didn't wanna
do and feel good doing it.

797
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,048
Some cases you get an instinct.

798
00:42:29,048 --> 00:42:31,684
I don't get it. How come
I haven't heard of you?

799
00:42:31,684 --> 00:42:33,019
It's a mystery.

800
00:42:33,352 --> 00:42:36,456
I was thinking maybe we could
serve as partners again.

801
00:42:36,456 --> 00:42:38,791
You know, on a permanent basis.

802
00:42:38,791 --> 00:42:40,359
Wherever I'm needed.

803
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:44,530
So, if I spoke to Aceveda, asked him
to put us together, you wouldn't mind?

804
00:42:45,098 --> 00:42:46,632
No, I wouldn't mind.

805
00:43:07,353 --> 00:43:09,589
Okay, who took my chair?

806
00:43:16,763 --> 00:43:20,166
Hey, Lem and Ronnie are psyched.
We're gonna go get a beer.

807
00:43:20,166 --> 00:43:22,435
Start without me.
I gotta take care of something first.

808
00:43:22,435 --> 00:43:26,672
Look, I talked to both of them,
and they're cool about what went down.

809
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:29,475
- Good.
- We got Lionel.

810
00:43:30,109 --> 00:43:32,612
- Got us a little breathing room.
- Yeah.

811
00:43:35,114 --> 00:43:37,784
- It was easy, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

812
00:43:38,951 --> 00:43:40,586
It was a little too easy.

813
00:43:51,664 --> 00:43:54,934
My church conducts monthly food drives
in Farmington to help feed families.

814
00:43:54,934 --> 00:43:57,203
I don't need the gospel.
I need work.

815
00:43:57,203 --> 00:43:58,938
My pastor knows a lot of people.

816
00:43:59,372 --> 00:44:01,107
I'll ask him if someone's hiring.

817
00:44:05,711 --> 00:44:08,414
Next time, find some help
before you do something stupid.

818
00:44:09,215 --> 00:44:10,683
Yeah.

819
00:44:12,285 --> 00:44:13,619
What are you doing?

820
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:16,155
I'm just letting him know where
his family could get some help.

821
00:44:18,524 --> 00:44:20,693
If you're gonna get emotionally
involved with every collar,...

822
00:44:20,693 --> 00:44:22,695
...get off the streets
and into social work.

823
00:44:22,695 --> 00:44:24,630
You don't have to tell
me about the streets.

824
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:26,098
I grew up on them.

825
00:44:26,098 --> 00:44:28,801
Living in them and working in them
are two different things.

826
00:44:28,801 --> 00:44:31,437
Look, I know I got a lot
to learn about police work.

827
00:44:31,437 --> 00:44:33,439
And you've got your way
that works for you.

828
00:44:33,439 --> 00:44:35,308
But I got a way
I wanna try for me.

829
00:44:35,875 --> 00:44:37,977
Hey. Oh, Jesus.

830
00:44:37,977 --> 00:44:39,445
I didn't know we're coed.

831
00:44:39,445 --> 00:44:41,047
Welcome to the experiment.

832
00:44:41,614 --> 00:44:43,850
- I'll be out in a sec.
- All right. Cool.

833
00:44:44,517 --> 00:44:46,352
All right. I'll see you tomorrow.

834
00:44:46,352 --> 00:44:47,854
It was a good day today.

835
00:44:55,294 --> 00:44:57,129
Hey, man.
So how was it out there?

836
00:44:57,997 --> 00:44:59,232
Fine.

837
00:44:59,232 --> 00:45:01,167
Yeah. There's nothing
like your first time.

838
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:15,681
I didn't think Gilroy was
ever gonna sign off on me.

839
00:45:15,681 --> 00:45:17,350
Don't take it personally.

840
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:19,619
- He was just busy.
- Well, I'm glad to be here.

841
00:45:19,619 --> 00:45:22,755
You'll like it.
The john's still broke.

842
00:45:22,755 --> 00:45:24,190
I'm working on it.

843
00:45:25,191 --> 00:45:27,260
- You ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready for anything.

844
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:29,262
Good, 'cause we get
everything down here.

845
00:45:30,129 --> 00:45:32,098
Starting to get a rep
out on the street.

846
00:45:32,098 --> 00:45:34,000
Bad guys don't like seeing us.

847
00:45:34,533 --> 00:45:36,135
It's starting to get fun.

848
00:45:37,003 --> 00:45:38,871
Hey, hey.

849
00:45:40,907 --> 00:45:42,375
<i>This here is Terry.</i>

850
00:45:42,375 --> 00:45:45,111
<i>- He comes to us from Robbery.
- Robbery?</i>

851
00:45:45,111 --> 00:45:46,879
<i>We love you, pretty
boys from Robbery.</i>

852
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:48,080
<i>How you doing?</i>
