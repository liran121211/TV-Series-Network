1
00:00:00,734 --> 00:00:02,102
<i>Previously on The Shield.</i>

2
00:00:02,102 --> 00:00:04,104
Before you got hurt, you...

3
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:06,272
...you said you'd leave the house.

4
00:00:06,272 --> 00:00:08,775
- I know.
- As soon as you can find a place.

5
00:00:10,443 --> 00:00:11,678
I need a room.

6
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:13,446
I do things that can't be forgiven.

7
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:15,448
You're gay, okay?

8
00:00:15,448 --> 00:00:16,616
I'm getting married.

9
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:18,651
- Married? To who?
- Vanessa.

10
00:00:18,651 --> 00:00:20,587
I'm happy to help you
if you're helping me.

11
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:22,288
- Are you?
- I have been.

12
00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:23,656
But I'm just about through.

13
00:00:23,656 --> 00:00:25,392
- Hi, Vic
- You're clean.

14
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:26,526
Yes.

15
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,428
This is a C.I. contract.

16
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:31,197
You'll be required
to provide four tips every month.

17
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:32,565
Tips that lead to arrests.

18
00:00:32,565 --> 00:00:34,601
- And I get paid?
- Two thousand a month.

19
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:36,903
Drop the gun now!

20
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:40,507
I'll never forget what you do.

21
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:42,108
I didn't do anything wrong.

22
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:44,110
Justice will find you.

23
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,513
I come out to go to work,
and I find my car like this.

24
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:48,782
The widow did this.
She knows where I live.

25
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:49,949
Tell me you're leaving!

26
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:52,919
Say it!

27
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:54,654
You work with a Detective Mackey?

28
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:56,122
The guy he's looking
for...

29
00:00:56,122 --> 00:01:00,427
And I'm afraid if Vic isn't careful,
he might start talking.

30
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:02,996
Means he's going to explain
the grill marks on his face.

31
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:05,498
Talk about how we were
protecting his drug competition.

32
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:07,066
If somebody else finds
him before us...

33
00:01:07,066 --> 00:01:09,202
Can't happen. We have
to find him first.

34
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,910
You've been greenlit.

35
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:19,479
<i>Detective Mackey.</i>

36
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:22,882
<i>Weren't you supposed
to meet me here to suck my xxxx?</i>

37
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:24,517
<i>I hope you all made it.</i>

38
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:27,687
<i>I wanted to speak to
you one last time.</i>

39
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:31,691
<i>You better talk to your brother
before you start making death threats.</i>

40
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:34,127
<i>I've already taken
care of my brother.</i>

41
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:38,665
<i>And now you've been greenlit.</i>

42
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:43,636
Department of Corrections
just sent this over.

43
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:47,106
When were you planning on telling me
about Armadillo's death threat?

44
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:50,610
Relax. Cops get
greenlit all the time.

45
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,712
It's just talk.
Nothing ever happens.

46
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:54,614
Armadillo had his
own brother killed.

47
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:57,650
If there's one guy who'd be
the exception, it's him.

48
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,052
Look at the
bright side.

49
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:02,255
This tape serves up Armadillo
for accessory to murder...

50
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:04,591
...and conspiracy to kill
a police officer.

51
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:07,560
- All we got to do is find him.
- Before he finds you.

52
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,862
Not a problem.

53
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:12,966
About the minority
on the Strike Team, Vic.

54
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:15,134
I've got a candidate
I want you to meet.

55
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:17,003
Sure. Send him by anytime.

56
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:22,642
Vic. Make sure you
and your guys watch your backs.

57
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:25,044
Yes.

58
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:28,948
Why does Aceveda want to
bring on another guy?

59
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:30,350
It's a quota thing.

60
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,418
We need color on the team,
so the brass can feel better...

61
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:34,754
...about underpaying
their Mexican gardeners.

62
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:37,223
Taking on a new guy...
This means one of us gets booted?

63
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:40,560
No. It means we go from four to five.
Have a seat.

64
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:47,367
I...

65
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,737
I'm sorry about this
Armadillo heat.

66
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:53,039
It's my shit.
It should be on me.

67
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,308
I never meant to get
you guys on a hit list.

68
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:58,378
We're a team, right?

69
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:00,613
- Yes, right.
- Right.

70
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:05,118
So, Armadillo's saying
you're greenlit.

71
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:08,621
Is that like you in a plural sense
or you in a singular sense?

72
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,295
No. It's just... I was on
the porch the whole time.

73
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:16,996
I mean, he didn't
really see me.

74
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:19,666
Don't worry about it.

75
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:22,201
We'll find him before
he gets to any of us.

76
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:23,970
What about this new team member?

77
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,372
Someone who doesn't understand
how we do things...

78
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:29,609
...could throw a wrench
into how we do things.

79
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:33,313
I'm not bringing anyone on
unless they understand.

80
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,549
How are the wedding plans
coming along?

81
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:40,286
Good.

82
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,424
Look, I'm not going to say
anything to Vanessa...

83
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:45,959
...you know, about things.

84
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:47,760
It's not my place.

85
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:50,229
Thank you.

86
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:53,032
It's just that if she hears from
somebody else though, you know,...

87
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:55,001
...or if you
slip...

88
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:56,936
she's going to be hurt
really bad.

89
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,107
I'm not going to slip.

90
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:06,646
That's us.
Washburn Terrace.

91
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:10,183
- What's the call?
- 911 hang-up.

92
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,653
Some three year old probably just
learned how to use the speed dial.

93
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:19,058
What's up?

94
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:21,761
I need you to put guys
on my wife and kids 24/7.

95
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,397
You think she's seeing someone?

96
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:26,366
It's not about that.

97
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:30,370
But if she is seeing someone,
you want to know about it, right?

98
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:35,642
Look, I've been putting a dent
in this Mexican banger's drug trade.

99
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:38,945
He made a threat. I got to make sure
he stays away from my wife and kids.

100
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:41,314
I'll put my best guys on it.

101
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:43,850
And one more thing. Corrine
can't know you're watching.

102
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:45,818
You're invisible. You got it?

103
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:46,953
Got it.

104
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:53,126
Julien.

105
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:05,338
One-Tango-13 requesting backup.
We have a forced entry.

106
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:07,407
<i>Roger that, One-Tango-13.</i>

107
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:15,314
Jesus.

108
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:30,096
One-Tango-13.
We have a 187.

109
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:32,498
Requesting additional
backup and an R.A.

110
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:36,402
<i>Roger, One- Tango-13.
Sending additional units and an R.A.</i>

111
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:48,948
God.

112
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:54,020
It's a battered woman's shelter.
Go to the other side.

113
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:12,165
It's okay. Come here.
It's okay. Come to me.

114
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,001
It's okay.

115
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:30,216
- You got everything you need?
- Yes.

116
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:33,787
- Stop it!
- Let me see it.

117
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:39,592
- No, I like that open.
- Stop it!

118
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:42,595
Cassidy. You still
locking up at night?

119
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:44,864
- Of course.
- Cassidy, stop!

120
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:46,166
Okay!

121
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:48,535
I'm putting a new alarm
system in the house.

122
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:51,771
- Why now?
- 'Cause with me not here...

123
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:54,107
...it's the only way you and the kids
are going to feel safe.

124
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:02,749
Yes. Where is it?

125
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,752
Private shelter for battered women.

126
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:09,422
They decide to leave their abuser.
They call a 1-800 number.

127
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:13,059
Get picked up, brought here.
Location's never given out.

128
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:15,528
Looks like the wrong person found it.

129
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:18,298
As far as I'm concerned,
there's only six suspects.

130
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:20,633
- A boyfriend or a husband.
- Yes.

131
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:23,203
No I.D.'s anywhere in the house.

132
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:27,540
These places usually issue aliases,
collect the women's wallets.

133
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:30,877
- Looks like he found them.
- He spent time in the house after.

134
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:33,246
Cut the power.
Snatched the closed-circuit videotape.

135
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:35,915
This is more premeditated
than blackout rage.

136
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:01,374
Any of the kids talk?

137
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,843
The child psychologist will
let us know when they're ready.

138
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,079
Ma'am, you can't go in there.

139
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:07,680
I'm Emma Prince, director
of this shelter.

140
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,416
- Step back!
- Can I help?

141
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:11,418
I live here. I run this shelter.

142
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:15,221
- I'm sorry.
- I have to get inside.

143
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:17,323
It's pretty bad.

144
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,694
I left for a few hours to pick
up some clothing donations.

145
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:24,898
They're all dead?

146
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,902
- What about the children?
- They're okay.

147
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,207
We're going to need some help
identifying the women.

148
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,009
We couldn't find their I.D.'s.

149
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:38,978
I only know their aliases.

150
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:40,580
Who would know
their real names?

151
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:45,318
Ms. Henry. She keeps
all that info in her computer.

152
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:46,519
Where is she?

153
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,955
She was in there when I left.

154
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:51,791
We're going to need
that information.

155
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:54,160
Her computer is password protected.

156
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,763
- Who else would know it?
- Our assistant, Julie.

157
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,832
She was also...

158
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,306
All seven of them?

159
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:12,278
- We only found six bodies.
- Six?

160
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:14,447
There should be seven.

161
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:18,485
We take a picture when they
arrive to document the abuse.

162
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,488
- And she arrived?
- Today. A prostitute.

163
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,223
Said her pimp had beaten her.

164
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,326
We usually don't take them in, but
if she went back on the street,...

165
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:27,760
...he'd kill her.

166
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,295
You were right
to help her, then.

167
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:36,603
I got two more women
coming in tomorrow.

168
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:38,671
I can't send them back
to their abusers.

169
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:40,840
Where am I supposed to take them?

170
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,675
Maybe the city has room for them.

171
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:45,745
If the city had room, I wouldn't have
had to start my own shelter.

172
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:49,782
Hold on.

173
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,685
Yes, that's her.

174
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:56,489
Walt. This is our missing woman.
Get her face and name out to everyone.

175
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,757
You got it.

176
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,660
It's password protected.

177
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:05,298
I know. That's why I called you.
You're the computer guy, right?

178
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:08,668
Yes, Police Information
Systems. P.I.S.

179
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,836
"Piss?"

180
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,272
We don't call it that.

181
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:14,941
I don't have any suspects
until I get the real names.

182
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:16,976
- Can you get 'em out?
- I'm not cleared to work on...

183
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:18,645
...non-departmental computers.

184
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:20,780
It's an emergency.

185
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:31,591
- Danny.
- Yes?

186
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:35,595
Yassirah Al-Thani just filed
another complaint against you.

187
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,099
She claims you made a threatening
phone call to her.

188
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:42,569
I didn't threaten her.

189
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:45,104
So you did
call her then? Why?

190
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,642
I just told her I knew what she was
doing, and I told her to stop.

191
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:51,911
Just please tell me you did
not call her from your house.

192
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,316
There will be a record of it then.
What were you thinking?

193
00:11:56,316 --> 00:12:00,553
She destroyed my car. She called
here saying that my mom died.

194
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,455
We can't prove any of that.

195
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:04,123
Please! Jesus!

196
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:06,025
She is trying to ruin my life!

197
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:08,127
We just ducked a major lawsuit...

198
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:11,664
...and you have just given her
a valid claim for harassment.

199
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:13,967
You're going to make
a formal apology.

200
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:19,973
How's it coming?

201
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,941
It's complicated.

202
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,278
What's going on?

203
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:27,580
Our "PIS" guy's incontinent.

204
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,248
Mind if I take a look?

205
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:30,516
No.

206
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:33,086
Emma I.D.'d our
missing woman.

207
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,788
Dorea Pinchuk. Five
priors for solicitation.

208
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,290
She's either a
witness or a victim.

209
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:38,625
Or an accomplice.

210
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,593
Emma says her pimp was beating her.

211
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,762
That's our guy.
We'll find out who he is.

212
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,097
No, I'll
find him.

213
00:12:44,664 --> 00:12:47,433
If this guy's behind the shelter
slaughter, he won't go down easy.

214
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,302
Thanks. We'll run down other leads.

215
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:51,504
<i>How are you doing
with I.D. 'ing the victims?</i>

216
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,808
- Your boy know what he's doing?
- Better than this PIS-poor pud.

217
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:59,579
Her name is Dorea Pinchuk.
She's a pro.

218
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:02,548
We think she was kidnapped
from the shelter this morning.

219
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:04,017
Might still be alive.

220
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:07,253
Don't recognize her.
Who decorated her face?

221
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:11,858
Her pimp. I want him.
You find out who he is. Ask around.

222
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:14,427
- See if anyone's spotted her.
- Okay.

223
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:16,763
Vic...

224
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:20,600
...this is kind of
a big thing, isn't it?

225
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,670
High profile. A lot of press.

226
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,072
- A lot of work.
- Help me find her.

227
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,642
I'll make sure that it counts
as two of your C.I. tips.

228
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:34,814
Yes. I was thinking
more like a bonus.

229
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:40,953
I'm trying to get
a decent place to live.

230
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:43,289
Maybe show I can
take care of Brian.

231
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:47,527
Find the pimp.
I'll see about your bonus.

232
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:51,497
She didn't firewall her backdoor.

233
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:54,734
- Most people don't.
- I can route around her password...

234
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:57,437
...by changing the operations
post back to default.

235
00:13:57,437 --> 00:13:58,871
I tried that.

236
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:04,811
There. What do you want to know?

237
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:08,481
Fantastic! I need the real names
of those women and kids.

238
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:11,684
Along with a formal apology
from this department...

239
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:14,721
...Officer Sofer would like
to address your client personally.

240
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:22,628
Mrs. Al-Thani, I apologize...

241
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:26,065
...for the phone call in which
I accused you of harassment.

242
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:28,935
I had no proof
to support such a claim...

243
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:33,172
...and I am very sorry
if it caused you any undue stress.

244
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:37,276
That's all good and well.
But we are still filing...

245
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:40,713
...a temporary restraining order
against Officer Sofer.

246
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,248
- On what grounds?
- For what?

247
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:45,251
Mrs. Al-Thani fears for her safety.

248
00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:48,087
You didn't shoot
and kill my husband?

249
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:53,392
You'll be receiving our
paperwork by the end of the day.

250
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:13,780
Stay put!

251
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,881
- What's this about?
- It's about her!

252
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:15,982
Do you know where she is?

253
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:18,351
Dorea? I wish I knew.

254
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:23,122
Get up here! You think
I'm screwing around, man?

255
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,526
Man! I haven't
seen her in a week, okay!

256
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,261
Who did that
to her face?

257
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:31,063
Her pimp! Yes, that's right.
That's you.

258
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,500
Man, I never put my hand
on any of my employees!

259
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,202
That's some old
school bullshit.

260
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:38,604
They can't go down if
their lips are busted up.

261
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,989
You call me if you hear from Dorea...

262
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:59,358
...and I don't haul
the rest of your stable in.

263
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:02,995
They can't go down
if they're locked up.

264
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:07,500
No, they can't.

265
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:12,071
Our pimp's a dead end.
You guys got anything?

266
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:13,239
According to shelter
records,...

267
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:15,842
...three of our victims checked
in with a total of five children.

268
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:19,212
- Hold on. We only found four.
- I know. We're a kid short.

269
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:20,813
There's a seven-year-old
boy missing.

270
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:21,981
The missing hooker's son?

271
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,317
No. His dad's the one guy we
haven't been able to locate.

272
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,685
His mom's one of our bodies.

273
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:27,086
Looks like we
got a suspect.

274
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:29,755
If it is him, he left his
two-year-old daughter behind.

275
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:32,358
A two year old's
harder to travel with.

276
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:34,060
Maybe he just doesn't like women.

277
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:38,831
I'll call back.

278
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,303
Who's our father of the year, and why
would he take a hooker with him?

279
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:46,505
Name's Mike Holden.
He's a firefighter.

280
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:49,609
He's got a thing for hookers.
Three priors for solicitation.

281
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:52,612
Any connection to Dorea?

282
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:57,049
She lied. The pimp never beat her.
He hasn't seen her in a week.

283
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:00,720
How much do you want to bet we find
her sliding down our fireman's pole?

284
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:11,330
All right. Okay. Settle down.

285
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:16,903
Brass finally get wise?

286
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:20,006
The new chief wants every captain in
blues and on the street once a month.

287
00:17:20,006 --> 00:17:21,707
A sort of keeping-it-real thing.

288
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,876
Yes. Keeping it real funny.

289
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:27,947
I'd let you try out for the Strike
Team, but, you know, very competitive.

290
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:34,520
- Ready?
- Sure.

291
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:36,322
Let's roll.

292
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:41,894
It was black and yellow.
Brand-new, with a black seat.

293
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,297
- A Street jammer.
- One of those new sleek things...

294
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:45,798
...with the 18 speeds.

295
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:48,267
Eighteen speeds.
Got it.

296
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:51,203
- Where was it stolen from?
- Our yard.

297
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:52,371
- Was it locked?
- Yes,...

298
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:54,407
...but I told him not
to leave it out.

299
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,310
$300, and I just bought it
two days ago.

300
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:00,579
We'll try to get it back.

301
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:06,786
Emma, hi.

302
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,255
These are the two women
I mentioned.

303
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,091
- Hello.
- I couldn't believe your message.

304
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,160
You really have a place
I can use temporarily?

305
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,095
The city has a few
apartments,...

306
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,698
...houses they use to stash
witnesses during trials.

307
00:18:19,065 --> 00:18:21,667
I fudged the paperwork, got it
signed out for a few days.

308
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:24,370
This isn't going to get you
into trouble, is it?

309
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,272
It's as white as a lie gets.

310
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:29,842
- I just hope it helps.
- You don't know how much.

311
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:35,948
Here's the address, the keys.
Call me if you need anything.

312
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,750
- Thank you.
- Sure.

313
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:39,986
Emma...

314
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:42,154
...you're doing a good
thing for these women.

315
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:44,223
Well...

316
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:46,559
...someone did it for me once.

317
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,702
You get my wedding invitation?

318
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,872
Yes. Moving pretty fast.

319
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:02,475
Yes. Vanessa and I are excited.

320
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:04,377
How long you been married?

321
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,412
Eight years this June.

322
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,849
Anything I should know going in?

323
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,385
Secrets.

324
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:15,921
Don't have any.
Tell her everything.

325
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:19,525
Because the one thing you think
she can't possibly know about...

326
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,161
...that's the one thing that
will come back to haunt you.

327
00:19:25,231 --> 00:19:26,332
Good to know.

328
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,170
That stolen bike. Black
and yellow Street jammer, right?

329
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,238
Yes.

330
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:44,750
- Is that your bike?
- Yes.

331
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,787
It's kind of small
for you, isn't it?

332
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:49,688
It rides, don't it?

333
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:52,291
We got a report of a stolen bike.

334
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,193
Brand-new. It looks
just like this one.

335
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,728
I didn't
steal it!

336
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:57,997
You may be young, but I will
arrest you. Give me the bike.

337
00:19:57,997 --> 00:19:59,732
- But I...
- Do you want me to take you in,...

338
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:00,833
...book you?

339
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:06,605
No.

340
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:08,607
Run home.

341
00:20:09,108 --> 00:20:10,342
Go on.

342
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:14,847
Don't let me catch you
out here again.

343
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:24,023
Two hours on the street.
Already cracked a case.

344
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:27,960
Well, you know.
Once you got it, you never lose it.

345
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:32,798
Have pimp daddy
get these to his girls.

346
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:35,801
Five grand? That's like
a hundred hand job reward.

347
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:38,871
Vic, that guy was the pimp
you were looking for, right?

348
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:41,640
- That was good, right?
- Yes, that was good.

349
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,975
I'm working on that
bonus for you.

350
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:44,643
In the meantime,
I got something else.

351
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:48,681
We think this is our shooter.

352
00:20:48,681 --> 00:20:51,383
Judging from his rap sheet,
he's a regular john.

353
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:53,652
Hand 'em out to the girls,
see if anybody knows him.

354
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,755
Five thousand dollars? That how
much my bonus is going to be?

355
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,458
No. That goes to whoever gives
us direct information...

356
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,227
...that leads to the
arrest of the guy...

357
00:21:01,227 --> 00:21:03,028
...or the safe return of the kid.

358
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:08,400
- Just get 'em out on the street.
- Yes, okay.

359
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,372
Want to tell me
why I'm here?

360
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:15,975
- You know Mike Holden?
- Yes. He's a friend.

361
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:17,743
You're more than
just friends.

362
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:19,578
Weren't you best man at
each other's weddings?

363
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:20,579
Yes.

364
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,048
Bailed him out of
trouble a few times?

365
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:27,386
Arrest for soliciting prostitutes.
A drunk and disorderly.

366
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:29,989
Each time, the charge
was dropped on a technicality.

367
00:21:30,256 --> 00:21:31,891
Officers make mistakes.

368
00:21:31,891 --> 00:21:34,193
And sometimes cops
help out their friends.

369
00:21:34,193 --> 00:21:35,728
Is there anything
wrong with that?

370
00:21:35,728 --> 00:21:38,130
Maybe not at Western division.
But here it's a different story.

371
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:40,466
That's not what I hear.

372
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:47,306
Six women were murdered
last night at a place...

373
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,742
...where their husbands shouldn't
have been able to find them.

374
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:58,617
That's Mike's wife Julie.
What... What happened?

375
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:00,152
Don't tell us you didn't hear.

376
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:04,557
Someone broke into a woman's shelter
and killed them. We think Mike did it.

377
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,060
- No way.
- There were five children...

378
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,930
...staying at the shelter.
Only Mike's son was taken.

379
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:14,333
Mike wouldn't do that. Mike loved
Julie. He wouldn't kill her.

380
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,303
He's violent enough
to beat her regularly, isn't he?

381
00:22:17,303 --> 00:22:19,405
She knew how to push
his buttons...

382
00:22:19,405 --> 00:22:22,341
...but it was never as black and white
as she made it out to be.

383
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,676
Why am I here?

384
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:26,245
I think you got the
address of the shelter.

385
00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:28,881
It's secret to the public,
but a cop could get it.

386
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:30,649
You told him
where she was.

387
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:32,184
Then he sent his hooker
girlfriend over there...

388
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:35,487
...to make sure, and then
he killed those women...

389
00:22:35,788 --> 00:22:38,390
...and disappeared
with the hooker and his kid.

390
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:44,296
Any idea where your
best man is now, Lou?

391
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:50,736
If I knew, that would make me
an accomplice after the fact.

392
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:52,938
No. We just want to find Mike.

393
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:55,474
I need, like, 20 minutes
to think about some things.

394
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:57,109
We don't have 20 minutes.

395
00:22:58,911 --> 00:23:00,546
Then I can't say anything.

396
00:23:17,964 --> 00:23:19,298
Tecks got a hit.

397
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:21,000
I talked to one
of my girls.

398
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,403
Seems your fireman had
a thing for Dorea.

399
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:25,772
He started seeing her regularly
and then off the books.

400
00:23:25,772 --> 00:23:28,574
Started playing Jack and Jill
on my goddamn dime.

401
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,076
- Anyone seen him?
- No.

402
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:31,978
And the girl won't
return my pages.

403
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:36,382
Screw her.
You hear something, you call us.

404
00:23:38,051 --> 00:23:40,687
- I can't believe it.
- Sometimes we're good.

405
00:23:40,687 --> 00:23:42,889
Sometimes we're lucky.
Sometimes we're both.

406
00:23:42,889 --> 00:23:44,691
- This is not mine.
- What?

407
00:23:44,691 --> 00:23:49,662
This is not my bike. I scratched
my initials under the seat. See?

408
00:23:49,662 --> 00:23:51,631
J.D. It's not there.

409
00:23:53,066 --> 00:23:54,300
You didn't tell us that.

410
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,902
Well, can I keep it anyways?

411
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:01,507
I'm afraid not.

412
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:05,578
Sorry.

413
00:24:08,548 --> 00:24:10,049
I just stole a kid's bike.

414
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,684
Time's up.

415
00:24:11,918 --> 00:24:14,253
I hope you used it
as wisely as we did.

416
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,290
Your bank says you withdrew
$400 today.

417
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:19,692
While you were on duty.
You mind if we look in your wallet?

418
00:24:25,998 --> 00:24:27,266
Where's the cash?

419
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:31,337
You got a call on your
cell from a pay phone...

420
00:24:31,337 --> 00:24:33,673
...10 minutes before you
made this withdrawal.

421
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:38,211
That money was for Mike, wasn't it?
You saw him after these murders.

422
00:24:38,878 --> 00:24:41,114
Look, I can't lose my job.

423
00:24:41,114 --> 00:24:42,315
This isn't about
your job.

424
00:24:42,315 --> 00:24:44,984
- Yes, it is!
- It's about a child's life!

425
00:24:46,219 --> 00:24:49,222
You know how many of these
things end in murder/suicide?

426
00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:50,556
Look...

427
00:24:51,023 --> 00:24:52,391
I'm not going to sit here
and tell you something...

428
00:24:52,391 --> 00:24:54,327
...and make me lose my job at 32.

429
00:24:55,428 --> 00:24:57,163
I'm not even sniffing a pension yet.

430
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:59,198
You knew Mike, Jr.

431
00:24:59,198 --> 00:25:01,467
You've been to his birthday parties.

432
00:25:01,467 --> 00:25:04,437
Believe me, I want this
thing to end well. I do.

433
00:25:06,105 --> 00:25:08,074
But I got my own kid
to worry about.

434
00:25:15,248 --> 00:25:16,516
He's not going
to talk.

435
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:18,751
He knows talking helps us
more than it helps him.

436
00:25:18,751 --> 00:25:20,620
He's not going to break
unless we give him a reason to.

437
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,455
The fact that he's a cop helps us.

438
00:25:22,822 --> 00:25:25,258
He may not like being unemployed,
but he'll like prison even less.

439
00:25:25,258 --> 00:25:28,528
It could take us all day to make a
deal with him. The kid could be dead.

440
00:25:28,528 --> 00:25:31,531
Let's throw him a lifeline, give him
a free pass for the information.

441
00:25:32,398 --> 00:25:35,501
Just 'cause he's a cop doesn't
mean he gets a free pass. Not from me.

442
00:25:36,602 --> 00:25:39,005
- Dutch is right.
- I'm not talking to you.

443
00:25:39,005 --> 00:25:42,241
- I'm talking about saving a kid.
- Don't act like I'm not.

444
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:44,677
- I vote he gets a pass.
- Who says your vote counts?

445
00:25:44,677 --> 00:25:47,380
I've been chasing down leads
all over this goddamn city.

446
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,648
Better believe my vote counts.

447
00:25:48,648 --> 00:25:52,018
- This isn't your call. It's ours.
- I think he's right.

448
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:04,430
How old did you say
your daughter was, Lou?

449
00:26:05,464 --> 00:26:08,334
- Three.
- I got two little girls of my own.

450
00:26:08,868 --> 00:26:11,204
- Family's good.
- And expensive.

451
00:26:11,204 --> 00:26:13,105
- No kidding.
- Yes.

452
00:26:13,673 --> 00:26:17,076
But, see, I understand
what your problem is, Lou.

453
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:20,613
You got to keep your job,
got to keep providing for them.

454
00:26:20,613 --> 00:26:22,415
I'm in a real tough spot here.

455
00:26:22,815 --> 00:26:26,152
Yes. Except
Mike's still out there.

456
00:26:27,386 --> 00:26:28,988
We think he has the kid.

457
00:26:29,388 --> 00:26:31,023
We don't think he's
in the best frame of mind.

458
00:26:31,023 --> 00:26:32,925
For Christ's sake, you think
I don't realize that?

459
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,293
I don't know what to do here.

460
00:26:34,293 --> 00:26:38,598
I mean, I'm... I'm
in an impossible position.

461
00:26:38,598 --> 00:26:41,567
Well, I think there's a way
we can both get what we need.

462
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:42,668
How?

463
00:26:44,971 --> 00:26:46,272
You a smoker, Lou?

464
00:26:48,574 --> 00:26:50,243
Are you jonesing for
a smoke about now?

465
00:26:50,243 --> 00:26:51,477
Yes.

466
00:26:51,477 --> 00:26:53,179
How's about you and me head
down to the motor pool,...

467
00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:54,380
...you grab that smoke...

468
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:57,783
...make an anonymous phone call,
tell me where Mike might've gone.

469
00:27:01,254 --> 00:27:02,722
I don't know.

470
00:27:06,025 --> 00:27:07,460
That's too risky.

471
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,162
You find him, you can make me an
accomplice after the fact. No way.

472
00:27:10,162 --> 00:27:12,098
- Come on, Lou.
- Look, you know I want to help.

473
00:27:12,398 --> 00:27:13,466
I just can't.

474
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,768
You son of a bitch.

475
00:27:16,636 --> 00:27:18,771
For the record, I have
no useful information.

476
00:27:18,771 --> 00:27:21,107
You know he's out there!
You know he's got the kid!

477
00:27:21,107 --> 00:27:23,643
All you can think about
is saving your own ass!

478
00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:24,911
What are you doing?

479
00:28:02,481 --> 00:28:05,551
Look. It's the po-po
who stole my bike.

480
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:08,220
There seems to have been
a misunderstanding.

481
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,423
- I told you I didn't steal it.
- Yes, you did.

482
00:28:10,423 --> 00:28:12,525
- And you didn't believe me.
- Well, we had a report.

483
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:15,127
- The description matched.
- Description?

484
00:28:15,127 --> 00:28:17,330
My parents said
that's racial profiling.

485
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:19,231
No, look. That's
not what happened here.

486
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:23,803
They said if I ever get profiled,
be polite, respect the officer...

487
00:28:23,803 --> 00:28:26,806
but get a badge number.

488
00:28:27,773 --> 00:28:30,343
- Look, here's your bike back.
- Is that a eight or a three?

489
00:28:30,343 --> 00:28:32,278
I'm sorry about
the mix-up.

490
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:34,880
It's his first day on the job.
He's still learning.

491
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,382
What do you say
we just forget about it?

492
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:38,250
I'll make sure
it doesn't happen again.

493
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:41,387
And I'll owe you one.

494
00:28:44,857 --> 00:28:48,461
All right. But
better not happen again.

495
00:28:56,802 --> 00:28:58,137
Thanks.

496
00:28:58,137 --> 00:28:59,538
Better not happen again.

497
00:29:07,146 --> 00:29:09,448
I hear Aceveda's putting
a new member on your team.

498
00:29:09,448 --> 00:29:12,451
No. He's jamming affirmative action
down our throats.

499
00:29:12,852 --> 00:29:14,587
Looking at any women?

500
00:29:14,587 --> 00:29:17,289
Yes. We're bringing in
Batgirl and Charlie's Angels.

501
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:21,360
I see. 'Cause someone like me could
never run with the real cops, right?

502
00:29:25,064 --> 00:29:30,536
No. I mean, you know, we're going to
look at all viable candidates.

503
00:29:33,005 --> 00:29:34,407
- Asshole.
- What?

504
00:29:34,407 --> 00:29:37,476
Come on! I didn't know
you were being serious.

505
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:40,079
Three years on Vice,
a year on Narcotics.

506
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:42,948
- Any gang time?
- Just what I saw in Vice.

507
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:45,084
A little undercover
when I first got my shield.

508
00:29:45,084 --> 00:29:47,553
- I'm a fast learner though.
- We're a tight team.

509
00:29:48,788 --> 00:29:50,623
Trust and brotherhood
keep us alive.

510
00:29:50,623 --> 00:29:52,458
Well, I'm looking
to be part of a team.

511
00:29:52,792 --> 00:29:53,859
I see that.

512
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:58,564
Decorated marine.
You see any action?

513
00:29:58,564 --> 00:30:01,367
Short tour in Bosnia.
Marines saved my ass.

514
00:30:02,068 --> 00:30:04,870
I used to be a hell-raiser.
Needed the discipline.

515
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:07,807
- You know how to follow the rules.
- Yes, sir.

516
00:30:07,807 --> 00:30:09,909
And I'm a guy who likes
busting people who break them.

517
00:30:14,113 --> 00:30:15,114
Good.

518
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:20,119
- I see you got a wife and kid.
- My boy'll be four next month.

519
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:21,787
Brave guy.

520
00:30:22,455 --> 00:30:25,191
Must've been a tough decision
to join my crew right now...

521
00:30:25,191 --> 00:30:27,193
...especially with people
you love at home.

522
00:30:28,694 --> 00:30:32,465
Yes. What do you mean?

523
00:30:32,465 --> 00:30:33,866
Didn't Aceveda tell you?

524
00:30:34,467 --> 00:30:36,669
We pissed off a serious
Mexican player.

525
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:38,170
The whole team's been greenlit.

526
00:30:38,804 --> 00:30:40,606
- Greenlit?
- Yes.

527
00:30:40,606 --> 00:30:41,974
Hits out on all of us.

528
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:49,949
What did you say to Villanueva?
He withdrew his application.

529
00:30:49,949 --> 00:30:52,118
That's too bad. He had promise.

530
00:30:52,118 --> 00:30:53,486
You scared
him off.

531
00:30:53,886 --> 00:30:55,521
Better in here than
out on the street.

532
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:57,823
Look, the field is only
going to get thinner.

533
00:30:57,823 --> 00:31:00,025
The choices don't get
much better than Robbie.

534
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:01,594
Maybe the next guy'll feel right.

535
00:31:01,594 --> 00:31:04,363
Don't think these stall
tactics are going to work.

536
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:06,532
We're going to hire a
minority and soon.

537
00:31:06,832 --> 00:31:08,134
Yes, Officer.

538
00:31:19,078 --> 00:31:20,880
Carla here says that fireman
picked her up...

539
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,916
...with another girl
a couple of times lately, weekends.

540
00:31:24,283 --> 00:31:25,518
For a threesome?

541
00:31:26,685 --> 00:31:31,190
To baby-sit. She'd watch his kid
while he banged the other one.

542
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,491
Sometimes the other way around.

543
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:36,228
Jesus. Why isn't she
telling me this?

544
00:31:37,029 --> 00:31:41,433
She just don't trust cops.

545
00:31:41,433 --> 00:31:43,569
Or maybe you just forgot
to tell her about the reward.

546
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:45,571
Whatever.

547
00:31:46,772 --> 00:31:49,542
- He come around lately?
- A couple of weeks ago.

548
00:31:49,542 --> 00:31:51,310
Okay. Well, he's got
the kid back.

549
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:54,480
You tell her to call me if he comes
around looking to play nasty nanny.

550
00:31:54,847 --> 00:31:56,815
- Don't worry. I'll call.
- Connie.

551
00:31:57,816 --> 00:31:59,084
Thanks for your help.

552
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:08,361
We know if our hooker's got a car?

553
00:32:08,361 --> 00:32:11,364
- None that's registered.
- That means he's driving his own.

554
00:32:11,364 --> 00:32:14,033
Or he stole one. Get me
a list of every car stolen...

555
00:32:14,033 --> 00:32:16,536
...within a five-mile radius
of the shelter last night.

556
00:32:16,536 --> 00:32:17,637
Yes, ma'am.

557
00:32:24,243 --> 00:32:26,879
Maybe you should go in,
try your way.

558
00:32:28,548 --> 00:32:31,851
If Lou knows we've got nothing on him,
what am I going to use for leverage?

559
00:32:32,518 --> 00:32:33,719
Yes. I don't know.

560
00:32:36,923 --> 00:32:40,693
Well, I'll try, but
it's a waste of time now.

561
00:32:46,666 --> 00:32:47,800
I checked the arrest reports.

562
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,636
You guys have been on the street seven
hours, haven't made a single collar.

563
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:53,139
- We're working a robbery.
- How's that going?

564
00:32:53,139 --> 00:32:55,208
- It's progressing.
- From the donut shop,...

565
00:32:55,208 --> 00:32:56,876
...to the sports bar,
to the strip club.

566
00:32:56,876 --> 00:32:58,344
Absolutely not.

567
00:33:00,346 --> 00:33:02,715
- Cute.
- The captain does not like excuses.

568
00:33:02,715 --> 00:33:04,383
He just likes results.

569
00:33:08,187 --> 00:33:11,724
You want to get the paperwork
on this bicycle thing, or should I?

570
00:33:11,724 --> 00:33:12,925
I'll do it tomorrow.

571
00:33:13,326 --> 00:33:15,261
We need to complete
our reports the same day.

572
00:33:17,196 --> 00:33:18,531
I'll let myself slide.

573
00:33:21,634 --> 00:33:23,536
The guys are here
putting in the alarm.

574
00:33:23,536 --> 00:33:24,737
Good.

575
00:33:24,737 --> 00:33:27,540
Vic, this isn't some
simple keypad by the door.

576
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,175
They're wiring the windows,...

577
00:33:29,175 --> 00:33:33,746
...putting in timed lights outside,
setting up motion detectors.

578
00:33:33,746 --> 00:33:35,615
Is there something
that I need to know?

579
00:33:35,615 --> 00:33:37,583
Know that you have
nothing to worry about.

580
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:40,253
It just seems a bit much.

581
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:44,023
It seems a little complicated at
first, but you'll get used to it.

582
00:33:44,023 --> 00:33:46,492
- Okay.
- Okay.

583
00:33:52,365 --> 00:33:54,867
Followed Corrine all day.
No problems.

584
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:56,369
- Same with the kids.
- Good.

585
00:33:56,369 --> 00:33:59,205
- They're beautiful children.
- Yes. Thanks.

586
00:33:59,205 --> 00:34:00,806
Listen. This
protection...

587
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,843
I can cut you a deal, but it's
still going to cost a bundle.

588
00:34:03,843 --> 00:34:06,812
- I know.
- I'd welcome the windfall.

589
00:34:06,812 --> 00:34:09,248
But paying to watch
your kids at recess?

590
00:34:09,749 --> 00:34:11,517
Let me just stick a couple of
guys on the house at night.

591
00:34:11,517 --> 00:34:12,785
That plus the alarm.

592
00:34:13,686 --> 00:34:16,389
I don't want to take
any chances right now. Stay on them.

593
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:19,792
Sure. Okay, Vic.
Good news is you're right.

594
00:34:20,192 --> 00:34:23,429
She's not seeing anyone.
At least not yet.

595
00:34:24,163 --> 00:34:27,366
You're a lucky man.
I'd leave the house to get milk...

596
00:34:27,366 --> 00:34:30,569
...my ex would be balling some other
guy before I got to the 7-11.

597
00:34:32,138 --> 00:34:33,272
I got to take this.

598
00:34:33,272 --> 00:34:35,308
Yes, sure.
I'll talk to you later.

599
00:34:36,842 --> 00:34:38,244
- Yes.
- It's me.

600
00:34:38,244 --> 00:34:39,578
Connie, where
are you?

601
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:41,347
I'm in an apartment.
I'm with the kid.

602
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:43,849
- What are you doing?
- I was with Carla...

603
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:46,419
...when Dorea came looking
for a baby-sitter.

604
00:34:47,486 --> 00:34:49,655
- I figured it was for him.
- Where are you?

605
00:34:49,655 --> 00:34:54,493
1530 Los Prisa, number 24,
right next to the 101 on-ramp.

606
00:34:55,361 --> 00:34:56,862
This'll get me the five grand,
right, Vic?

607
00:34:56,862 --> 00:34:58,965
Get the kid
and get out of there right now!

608
00:35:00,232 --> 00:35:03,469
I can't. I'm in the bedroom. I got
to go past them to get to the door.

609
00:35:03,469 --> 00:35:06,472
Is there a window or a fire escape?

610
00:35:07,707 --> 00:35:09,842
- Who are you talking to?
- Connie!

611
00:35:11,077 --> 00:35:12,545
Setting up my next date.

612
00:35:12,545 --> 00:35:14,613
You're still mine
for another 20 minutes.

613
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:15,848
Come join us.

614
00:35:19,085 --> 00:35:20,786
Shouldn't someone stay with him?

615
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:22,488
No. He sleeps through anything.

616
00:35:52,618 --> 00:35:55,354
Okay. Let's set up a containment.

617
00:35:55,788 --> 00:35:58,824
Ronnie, you take the rear.
Lem, you take starboard.

618
00:35:58,824 --> 00:36:00,659
- You take port.
- Where are you going?

619
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:03,796
Through the front door, as soon
as the department snipers get here.

620
00:36:06,232 --> 00:36:07,333
Shit!

621
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,168
We're supposed to be
non-code.

622
00:36:09,168 --> 00:36:11,270
Nobody told the ambulances.
Goddamn it!

623
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:26,552
- You called the cops.
- No. I swear!

624
00:36:27,153 --> 00:36:28,521
- Drop the
gun, Mike!

625
00:36:28,521 --> 00:36:30,389
- Put the gun down, Mike!
- Call 'em off!

626
00:36:31,057 --> 00:36:32,558
Take that gun
away from her!

627
00:36:32,558 --> 00:36:35,494
Otherwise, you might as well be
putting a bullet into your head!

628
00:36:35,795 --> 00:36:38,297
- I want 'em gone!
- Okay.

629
00:36:39,065 --> 00:36:41,767
Back off! Everybody, back off!

630
00:36:45,905 --> 00:36:48,741
Mike, I'm coming in to talk.

631
00:36:49,275 --> 00:36:51,944
- I don't need to talk!
- Two hostages are better than one!

632
00:36:53,079 --> 00:36:54,513
Gun stays outside!

633
00:36:55,915 --> 00:36:59,685
Throw down piece two! Come on!
You think I don't know cops?

634
00:37:03,189 --> 00:37:06,058
Okay, Dorea, get the door.

635
00:37:11,597 --> 00:37:12,731
Come on!

636
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:17,069
Shut the door! Lock it!

637
00:37:17,603 --> 00:37:18,771
Lock it!

638
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,475
Shut the blinds!

639
00:37:23,175 --> 00:37:25,144
Goddamn snipers, right?
Shut the blinds!

640
00:37:32,151 --> 00:37:33,152
You okay?

641
00:37:34,587 --> 00:37:35,754
You need a plan.

642
00:37:36,122 --> 00:37:37,323
I'm the man
that can make it happen.

643
00:37:37,323 --> 00:37:38,824
Cut the negotiator
101 crap!

644
00:37:38,824 --> 00:37:40,860
You're going to do what I tell
you, or I'll kill you both!

645
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:44,296
Fine. Take me.
Let the girl and the kid go.

646
00:37:44,296 --> 00:37:47,366
I already have what I want!
Call your buddies!

647
00:37:47,366 --> 00:37:49,034
Tell 'em you're in here if
they're thinking of using gas...

648
00:37:49,034 --> 00:37:50,402
...or knocking
down the door!

649
00:37:50,402 --> 00:37:51,770
It's not going to matter
to them that I'm in here.

650
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:55,141
They're not going to do the risky
stuff with one of their own!

651
00:37:55,941 --> 00:37:58,444
- Do it! Do it!
- Okay. Okay.

652
00:38:05,985 --> 00:38:07,753
- What's going on?
- Mackey's inside.

653
00:38:07,753 --> 00:38:11,790
So... Why don't you
let him go? The kid.

654
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:12,925
He's been
through enough.

655
00:38:12,925 --> 00:38:14,560
I didn't go through all this
just to lose him again.

656
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,162
- He's mine.
- He's your son.

657
00:38:16,162 --> 00:38:18,297
- He's not your property.
- You don't know anything about it!

658
00:38:18,297 --> 00:38:22,935
The hell I don't!
I got a boy. I had a boy.

659
00:38:23,302 --> 00:38:24,970
My wife has him now.

660
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:28,874
She left me. Made me leave.

661
00:38:29,308 --> 00:38:31,810
Then she took my son
and my little girls.

662
00:38:35,915 --> 00:38:38,684
- They always take everything.
- Everything except advice.

663
00:38:38,684 --> 00:38:41,787
That's why I like whores.
You know what you're buying.

664
00:38:41,787 --> 00:38:43,055
We never had a
problem, did we, baby?

665
00:38:43,889 --> 00:38:48,527
It's not even like I feel alone.
I just feel abandoned.

666
00:38:49,128 --> 00:38:51,764
- Pissed off?
- Yes. Hell, Yes, pissed off.

667
00:38:53,098 --> 00:38:54,500
I tried with Julie.

668
00:38:55,401 --> 00:38:57,269
I didn't want... I didn't...

669
00:38:57,870 --> 00:39:00,072
It's all right. I've had
the same thoughts...

670
00:39:00,072 --> 00:39:01,874
...go through my mind
that you've had.

671
00:39:02,408 --> 00:39:05,110
You're not the only guy
who's been used.

672
00:39:07,146 --> 00:39:10,349
Most of all, I just miss my kids.

673
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:16,889
I can feel myself becoming
a stranger to 'em, you know?

674
00:39:26,232 --> 00:39:29,134
- You're so full of shit.
- No.

675
00:39:29,134 --> 00:39:31,136
You're going to sit there and
pretend to understand me,...

676
00:39:31,136 --> 00:39:32,571
...what I'm going through?

677
00:39:32,571 --> 00:39:34,406
- I'm telling you the truth.
- You think I'm going to believe...

678
00:39:34,406 --> 00:39:36,342
...a bullshit story like that?

679
00:39:36,342 --> 00:39:37,676
- Calm down!
- What, it's going to make me...

680
00:39:37,676 --> 00:39:38,777
...associate with you?

681
00:39:38,777 --> 00:39:40,846
- Calm down!
- I'm going to give you this gun?

682
00:39:40,846 --> 00:39:44,550
You think I'm some kind of idiot
that you don't have to take seriously?

683
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,986
- Of course I do.
- This is how serious I am!

684
00:39:55,595 --> 00:39:58,798
- Don't move! Don't move! Don't move!
- No!

685
00:39:59,198 --> 00:40:01,267
Suspect is wearing a gray T-shirt.

686
00:40:03,369 --> 00:40:05,037
- She's dying.
- You're going to be dead too...

687
00:40:05,037 --> 00:40:06,105
...if you move.

688
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,542
- You didn't need to do that.
- Shut up.

689
00:40:10,643 --> 00:40:13,913
Jesus! What the hell
is the matter with you?

690
00:40:13,913 --> 00:40:16,482
- Shut up!
- You stupid piece of shit!

691
00:40:16,482 --> 00:40:18,050
Dad, what's wrong?

692
00:40:18,484 --> 00:40:21,621
Mikey, it's all right.
Stay in there, okay? Shut up.

693
00:40:21,621 --> 00:40:22,722
Dad?

694
00:40:22,722 --> 00:40:24,257
I can't think when
you're talking.

695
00:40:24,257 --> 00:40:27,293
It's okay. It's okay. Just go inside.

696
00:40:49,482 --> 00:40:50,583
Christ!

697
00:41:09,302 --> 00:41:10,636
Vic, I'm...

698
00:41:21,314 --> 00:41:23,082
- Officer Sofer.
- Yes?

699
00:41:23,449 --> 00:41:25,184
Detectives Branning and Simpkins.

700
00:41:25,718 --> 00:41:28,421
- I.A.D.
- Yes?

701
00:41:29,488 --> 00:41:30,856
We need to search your vehicle.

702
00:41:32,191 --> 00:41:33,793
- Why?
- We got an anonymous call.

703
00:41:33,793 --> 00:41:36,462
Someone claims you're dealing
marijuana out of your car.

704
00:41:40,333 --> 00:41:44,070
Okay, look. I was involved
in an on-duty shooting last month.

705
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:46,272
That guy's wife has it out for me.

706
00:41:46,272 --> 00:41:48,507
This is another bullshit
prank of hers.

707
00:41:48,507 --> 00:41:51,844
Either way, new regulations say we
have to investigate every complaint.

708
00:41:52,244 --> 00:41:55,147
No matter how bogus.
Where's your car?

709
00:42:08,527 --> 00:42:09,729
Got something.

710
00:42:11,163 --> 00:42:13,632
Wait a minute. That's not mine.

711
00:42:13,632 --> 00:42:16,502
I told you, this Arab woman.
She wants my job!

712
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:18,637
She's the one that
vandalized my car.

713
00:42:18,637 --> 00:42:20,806
She must've put the pot
in at the same time.

714
00:42:20,806 --> 00:42:23,809
We'll look into that, but we're also
going to have some questions.

715
00:42:23,809 --> 00:42:26,679
What sort of questions? Dust
the bag for fingerprints.

716
00:42:26,679 --> 00:42:28,514
You're not going to find mine.

717
00:42:28,514 --> 00:42:29,682
Let's talk inside.

718
00:42:33,552 --> 00:42:37,123
Please! What do you think I am,
some big-time drug dealer?

719
00:42:37,123 --> 00:42:40,693
I just happen to keep my pot all four
ounces of it in an unlocked car...

720
00:42:40,693 --> 00:42:42,461
...in the middle
of a police station?

721
00:42:46,298 --> 00:42:47,533
It's a setup.

722
00:42:51,337 --> 00:42:54,740
Mike's been shot. He's dead.

723
00:42:55,107 --> 00:42:56,308
Jesus!

724
00:42:57,543 --> 00:43:00,679
He also managed to take
another woman's life before he died.

725
00:43:03,149 --> 00:43:07,253
Eight people dead.
But you saved your job.

726
00:43:07,553 --> 00:43:09,655
Listen. I never wanted
any of this to happen.

727
00:43:09,655 --> 00:43:10,790
Good for you.

728
00:43:11,891 --> 00:43:13,759
Now get the hell out of my sight.

729
00:43:29,275 --> 00:43:31,811
Okay, your system's running fine.

730
00:43:32,244 --> 00:43:35,247
Well, it should.
They told me it cost $2,000.

731
00:43:35,247 --> 00:43:38,451
I got a deal from a guy I know.
Sort of a barter thing.

732
00:43:44,256 --> 00:43:45,391
What's wrong?

733
00:43:46,258 --> 00:43:48,461
- What?
- Did something happen?

734
00:43:49,995 --> 00:43:51,130
It's just work.

735
00:43:51,997 --> 00:43:53,899
Just make sure you
turn it on when I leave.

736
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,369
I will. Are you...
Are you sure you're all right?

737
00:43:57,937 --> 00:43:58,971
Yes.

738
00:44:00,272 --> 00:44:02,508
I'll see you and the kids
tomorrow for dinner.

739
00:44:03,409 --> 00:44:04,643
Okay.

740
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:19,291
Here you go.

741
00:44:21,894 --> 00:44:23,496
They found it, Mama.

742
00:44:23,496 --> 00:44:25,631
Put this on, little man.
State law.

743
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,170
Okay. Go, go!

744
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:33,172
Go! Thank you.

745
00:44:33,172 --> 00:44:34,473
We're here to serve.

746
00:44:36,876 --> 00:44:38,577
$300 for a bike!

747
00:44:38,844 --> 00:44:41,280
Lucky this uniform thing
is only once a month.

748
00:44:41,914 --> 00:44:43,782
Any more crying kids,
I'd be broke.

749
00:45:00,232 --> 00:45:02,535
I thought I'd stop by
and check out the new digs.

750
00:45:03,135 --> 00:45:04,270
Nice.

751
00:45:05,504 --> 00:45:06,672
What's this?

752
00:45:07,239 --> 00:45:08,374
Donation.

753
00:45:09,175 --> 00:45:10,409
Thank you.

754
00:45:16,182 --> 00:45:17,750
Things we do to each other.

755
00:45:20,352 --> 00:45:23,622
- Maybe someday I'll understand.
- I doubt it.

756
00:45:27,193 --> 00:45:28,627
Thanks for the food.
