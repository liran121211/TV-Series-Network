1
00:00:00,867 --> 00:00:02,302
<i>Previously on The Shield.</i>

2
00:00:02,302 --> 00:00:03,837
I do nothing wrong!

3
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:05,271
Drop the gun now!

4
00:00:08,641 --> 00:00:11,277
No, I need it now to get back my kids.

5
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:13,947
- What are you talking about?
- They're gone, Shane!

6
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:17,250
Corrine took 'em and disappeared.

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,219
I had some cash and
my records in the safe.

8
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:21,988
Like payments to me?
My name is in that goddamn ledger?

9
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:24,457
It's in code, man.
I call you "Landlord."

10
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:28,328
He was making monthly payments to a
landlord when he owns the building.

11
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:30,663
Maybe this is the guy
Armadillo's trying to squeeze out.

12
00:00:30,663 --> 00:00:34,868
Pack up your shit and get on the next
donkey back to home.

13
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,503
I want to be staying for a while?

14
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:38,171
You gonna watch my back.

15
00:00:38,771 --> 00:00:42,275
How do I know I can trust you?

16
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:43,643
I guess we have a deal.

17
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:45,512
What happened here today
was bullshit!

18
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:47,547
I'm gonna find the truth.

19
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:51,484
And if I have to go
through both of you... I'll get it.

20
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:54,187
- <i>Mackey! Mackey!
</i>- Tio?

21
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:01,995
I asked you to leave.

22
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:06,232
I don't have to leave.

23
00:01:11,437 --> 00:01:13,039
<i>Vic! Come on, dude!</i>

24
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:16,409
<i>- Tell me you're leaving!
</i>- That which doesn't kill me...

25
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:28,121
<i>Come on! Come on! Let go!</i>

26
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:57,150
Vic!

27
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:00,913
Hi.

28
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:03,483
David Aceveda.
Vote for me. Appreciate it.

29
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:14,961
Hi. David Aceveda.
Vote for me.

30
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,658
That's an arm.

31
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:03,110
Went to Armadillo's place
to talk to him about Tio's murder.

32
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,212
- What'd he say?
- He wasn't there.

33
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:06,380
Signs of a
struggle though.

34
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,315
Bloodstains, seared
flesh on the stove.

35
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:09,617
Pretty ugly stuff.

36
00:04:09,617 --> 00:04:11,218
That sounds like
Armadillo's M.O.

37
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:13,153
Checked Tio's phone records.

38
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:16,023
You were the last call
he made last night...

39
00:04:16,023 --> 00:04:17,591
...on his cell
before he died.

40
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:20,327
Yes. He sounded kind of agitated.

41
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:22,196
- We got cut off.
- Too bad.

42
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:25,666
What are you asking me?

43
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:29,503
Look, I don't like these questions
any more than you do.

44
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:34,408
I was with my guys all last night
while Tio was being killed.

45
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:36,143
Feel free to ask 'em.

46
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:38,946
Okay, then.

47
00:04:40,681 --> 00:04:42,783
Single blow, a heavy blade.

48
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,652
An ax, maybe
a machete.

49
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:46,287
How long ago?

50
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:49,557
<i>Based on core temp,
</i>I'd say recently.

51
00:04:49,557 --> 00:04:50,824
Three to
four hours.

52
00:04:51,492 --> 00:04:54,261
So she's been dead
since around 6:00.

53
00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:55,763
Didn't say she
was dead.

54
00:04:56,263 --> 00:04:58,065
Skin lividity and clotting
indicate she was alive...

55
00:04:58,065 --> 00:04:59,366
...when this happened.

56
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:03,137
Sadomasochistic
torture ritual.

57
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:04,905
Okay.

58
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:07,741
If someone were trying to keep her
alive, how long could she survive?

59
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:11,178
With a tourniquet and basic
medical knowledge, indefinitely.

60
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:12,713
Until he tired of
his domination...

61
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:14,815
...and control Dr.
Mengele experiments...

62
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,584
...and decided to squeeze
the last breath...

63
00:05:16,584 --> 00:05:18,485
...out of her so he could watch.

64
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,754
See, this is why you
and me can't date.

65
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:24,291
Run these prints.
Get me an I.D. Now.

66
00:05:27,428 --> 00:05:28,662
I spoke to Shane.

67
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:33,667
He said you weren't with him
for about an hour last night.

68
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:37,571
Yes. That's right.

69
00:05:38,072 --> 00:05:40,774
I was with a private eye
named, Gordie Liman.

70
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:42,576
What's he got to do
with Tio and Armadillo?

71
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:46,246
Nothing. It's a private matter.
I'd rather it stay that way.

72
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:48,082
I'm happy to help you
if you're helping me.

73
00:05:48,082 --> 00:05:50,017
- Are you?
- I have been.

74
00:05:50,985 --> 00:05:52,519
But I'm just about through.

75
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,489
I guess I'll have to
figure this out on my own.

76
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:00,995
What the hell was that all about?

77
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:03,564
Nothing.

78
00:06:10,404 --> 00:06:12,906
Why didn't you just
leave it here and call 911?

79
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:15,709
- This dog was sniffing around it.
- So?

80
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,011
It's a bone.

81
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,714
The arm probably fell
out of the Dumpster...

82
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:21,982
...when the truck
picked it up.

83
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:23,684
Call city services.
Remand the truck.

84
00:06:23,684 --> 00:06:25,119
Have some unis
search it.

85
00:06:25,486 --> 00:06:28,022
The rest of her might still be
in that truck. Alive, even.

86
00:06:28,022 --> 00:06:29,623
Lowe, did we I.D.
the fingerprints yet?

87
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:30,791
There's a
backlog.

88
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,793
Backlog? I cant find her
if I can't I.D. her.

89
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:33,961
Give me that.

90
00:06:33,961 --> 00:06:36,664
Have your guys do door knocks.
Talk to every neighbor.

91
00:06:36,664 --> 00:06:39,099
Tell everyone if they find
anything, give me a call.

92
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:41,068
This is Detective Wagenbach.

93
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:43,370
I told you I needed
a rush on those prints.

94
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,675
We don't know she's dead.
She could still be alive.

95
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:52,179
And if she is, I'd hate to see
your backlog cost her her life.

96
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:54,181
You told Claudette I
was gone for an hour?

97
00:06:54,181 --> 00:06:55,549
You were gone for an hour.

98
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:58,419
Jesus! She's all over my ass
about this Tio connection.

99
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:00,521
She said she'd talk to you.
The truth was the safest bet.

100
00:07:00,521 --> 00:07:02,890
- Now it looks like I'm lying to her.
- You are lying to her.

101
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,458
What, are you trying
to be a wiseass?

102
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:06,927
- No, I'm just...
- Just shut the hell up!

103
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,531
- Christ!
- Where are we headed?

104
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:13,534
I got things to do. I gave you guys
to Aceveda for the day.

105
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:16,537
- What?
- A group of male hustlers...

106
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:20,274
...is hangin' out on the same block
as Aceveda's campaign headquarters.

107
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:22,643
He's setting up a sting operation.
I volunteered you guys.

108
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:24,044
You can't
be serious.

109
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:26,113
Your shirt's gay
enough for the job.

110
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:30,217
What do you mean
you gave us to Aceveda? What...

111
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:34,188
Great. I've got your assignments.
Briefing room, five minutes.

112
00:07:38,392 --> 00:07:40,594
Is everything okay with Kayla?

113
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:42,362
When was the last time
you saw your roommate?

114
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:44,565
Last night
around 6:00.

115
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:46,500
She didn't come
home all night?

116
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,736
I don't know.
I slept at my boyfriend's.

117
00:07:48,736 --> 00:07:50,604
Any idea where she might have gone?

118
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:55,409
There's two million single men in L.A.
Take your pick.

119
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:57,344
We found her car in the garage,
but not her purse or keys.

120
00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:58,545
Is there someone close?

121
00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:00,180
Somewhere she
might have walked to?

122
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:02,182
Wait a minute.

123
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,718
Is Kayla dead?

124
00:08:06,754 --> 00:08:09,423
We have every reason to believe
that she's still alive.

125
00:08:10,424 --> 00:08:12,226
'Cause I don't want to be a bitch...

126
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:14,461
...but our rent's due next week.

127
00:08:17,865 --> 00:08:20,868
- Vic. I got great news.
- What?

128
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:24,772
Just be glad you hired me and not
the brain-dead idiot your wife did.

129
00:08:24,772 --> 00:08:26,840
Jerk off privately.
What do you got?

130
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:31,178
Corrine's P.I., they're making
nonsecure calls from his cell phone.

131
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,747
I caught one.
Found where she's at.

132
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:38,118
- Beauty. You got the address?
- Yes, sure.

133
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,823
Corrine... Don't run away.

134
00:08:43,257 --> 00:08:45,125
Just hear me out
for two seconds.

135
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:47,895
Look, this running has to stop.

136
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:49,963
How much time
could you possibly need?

137
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:53,267
This isn't about me, Vic. It's about
our kids, about them being safe.

138
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:55,469
Do you honestly think
I'd put my children in danger?

139
00:08:55,469 --> 00:08:58,438
Not intentionally, but the
things going on in your life...

140
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:00,574
Something told me to run.

141
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:03,510
School's back
in session.

142
00:09:04,011 --> 00:09:05,412
Matthew needs to
be at Glenridge.

143
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:08,582
He needs his routine.
Cassidy needs to see her friends.

144
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,919
This isn't going to
change things between us.

145
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,821
Don't punish them
because of me.

146
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,859
I'll move out if I have to,
if that's what it takes.

147
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,196
But I need to know that they're
at home where they can be safe.

148
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:29,102
I don't... I don't know, okay?
I'll think about it.

149
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:39,179
How'd your meeting
with I.A.D. go last night?

150
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:41,381
Good. Good.

151
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:42,983
You ran out of here so quick.

152
00:09:43,317 --> 00:09:45,519
They told me not
to discuss it with anyone.

153
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,821
But it went fine.

154
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,295
Anything yet?

155
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:09,443
- Hi. I'm Detective Wagenbach.
- All right. Just a second.

156
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:15,415
<i>- Bob, the police are here.
</i>- Police? Open it.

157
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:21,455
I saw you all coming in.
What's going on?

158
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:23,590
I'm investigating
your neighbor's disappearance.

159
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:26,593
You hear or see anything
suspicious last night?

160
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:28,695
- Which neighbor?
- Kayla LeSeur.

161
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:32,032
Man. We heard her arguing
last night out on the balcony.

162
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:35,068
Yes, around midnight. I saw her
through the window with a guy.

163
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:37,271
You recognize
him?

164
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:39,606
Yes. Marcy had me
come take a look.

165
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:41,441
I've seen him around a few times.

166
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:43,944
Come down, give a description?

167
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:47,981
Sure. Let me just grab my jacket.

168
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:49,216
Great.

169
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:02,529
- Alvarez?
- All right. Let's take Union.

170
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:04,231
How's my favorite hillbilly?

171
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:05,999
Joe, what in the hell
you doin' here?

172
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,868
I'm here to meet
the big guy for lunch.

173
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:11,805
- You still crackin' skulls?
- Yes, man. How's retirement?

174
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:13,874
I'm shavin' a few strokes
off my golf game.

175
00:11:13,874 --> 00:11:15,108
You look good.

176
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:17,277
- You I don't know.
- Ronnie Gardocki.

177
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:19,746
Joe Clarke. Taught your boss
everything he knows.

178
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:22,482
Yes, but you didn't teach me
everything you know, right?

179
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:24,151
That's right.
I'm saving some.

180
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:26,753
We're going to grab a bite.
Want to go?

181
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:28,021
They're busy.

182
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:34,828
When I miss tee time at Riviera
for this, you better be buying.

183
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:37,531
Riviera? Since when do they let
hacks like you play at Riviera?

184
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:44,438
You guys still here? Come on!

185
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:48,141
Who was that with Vic?

186
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:49,810
Joe Clarke, his
old partner.

187
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,845
They kicked him
off the force.

188
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:52,946
Why is that?

189
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:54,982
Some punk took a swing
at his last partner.

190
00:11:54,982 --> 00:11:57,084
Joe knocked out like half
of his teeth in front of this crowd.

191
00:11:57,084 --> 00:11:58,785
<i>Total railroad job.</i>

192
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:03,190
Don't worry. It's nothing like
what you're going through.

193
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:12,065
So it's been a year
since you called me up.

194
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,067
You drag my ass down here.
What's going on?

195
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:16,703
Can't I buy you lunch?

196
00:12:17,671 --> 00:12:19,639
Vic, come on.

197
00:12:22,376 --> 00:12:23,744
It's...

198
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:27,481
...been a pretty rough ride lately...

199
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:31,418
Enough I'm thinking about
gettin' off the train.

200
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:39,359
You want to give up your badge?

201
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:43,897
I'm lookin' for a sign.
Seen any around?

202
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:46,733
You don't want to give it up.

203
00:12:47,034 --> 00:12:48,435
Retirement's been
pretty good to you.

204
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:49,970
A forced retirement.

205
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,139
Believe me. I still miss it.

206
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:54,274
We can hit the links
together every day.

207
00:12:57,744 --> 00:12:59,146
What's bothering you now?

208
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:07,287
When...

209
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:10,490
When we were ridin'...

210
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:15,495
...you ever feel like
you went too far?

211
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:18,632
Yes. Couple times, maybe.

212
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:21,835
Probably.

213
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:27,107
Definitely.

214
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:29,576
Hell, you can't always
land just right.

215
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:33,046
Goin' too far will get you fired. Not
goin' far enough will get you killed.

216
00:13:34,448 --> 00:13:36,249
I never lost any sleep
over it though.

217
00:13:37,451 --> 00:13:41,321
Anyway, we always did
more good than bad, right?

218
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:45,358
Right.

219
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:48,695
That's the key.

220
00:13:58,405 --> 00:14:00,107
- Yes. That's him, all right.
- Yes.

221
00:14:00,107 --> 00:14:02,008
- Good.
- Anything else we can do?

222
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,510
She was such a nice girl.

223
00:14:03,777 --> 00:14:05,212
She still is.

224
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:09,749
Roommate I.D.'d the photo
as a Jordan Arnold.

225
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:12,352
Run the D.M.V.
Get me an address now.

226
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:13,820
We're running out of time.

227
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:17,891
Snitch's Tavern.
Your first arrest.

228
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:21,661
That guy had to be 6'6" easy.

229
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:25,265
Still, that bust
was when I knew.

230
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:27,400
Knew?

231
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,403
That maybe you wouldn't be
a complete screwup after all.

232
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:33,607
Take a right up here. I
want to show you something.

233
00:14:33,607 --> 00:14:35,509
No, I can't. I got to
get back to the barn.

234
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:37,110
I got some stuff I
got to check up.

235
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:40,113
Bullshit. This is your
training officer, all right?

236
00:14:40,614 --> 00:14:43,717
Take the afternoon off. Humor an
old man. Take a right. Come on.

237
00:14:44,518 --> 00:14:45,886
All right.

238
00:14:47,521 --> 00:14:48,622
<i>Yes?</i>

239
00:14:49,623 --> 00:14:51,625
I've got a problem
on this Tio murder.

240
00:14:52,926 --> 00:14:53,994
What's that?

241
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:58,331
The more I look into it,
the more Vic Mackey's name pops up.

242
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:02,869
Well, Tio was Vic's C.I.

243
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,671
He was also a drug dealer.

244
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:07,073
Vic's name is all over
his phone records.

245
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:09,943
But Vic told me he hadn't
talked to him in months.

246
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:12,345
He lied.

247
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,215
Well, what do you
want to do about it?

248
00:15:17,184 --> 00:15:18,885
I went through Tio's place.

249
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:23,423
I found his business ledger detailing
payments made to a landlord.

250
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:29,496
I want to check them against Vic's
cash deposits in his bank accounts.

251
00:15:30,997 --> 00:15:32,399
I need your authorization.

252
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:36,570
Claudette, Vic's one of us.

253
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:45,712
I got a dead drug dealer.

254
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:49,916
I got a suspect who's
probably skipped town...

255
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,118
...and the only person who
can shed some light on it...

256
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:55,155
...is an uncooperative cop
with a bad rep.

257
00:15:58,391 --> 00:16:00,994
You want me to let this case
just slip away, son?

258
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:05,765
I.A.D. on Danny's shooting.

259
00:16:07,234 --> 00:16:09,636
Draw up the authorization form.
I'll take a look at it.

260
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:15,008
Everything looking good
for my officer?

261
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,515
Getting all the
cooperation you need?

262
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:24,050
Pardon?

263
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:28,788
'Cause if anybody's giving you
any interference, I can help.

264
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,491
Thanks.

265
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,094
Claudette, witness brought in
a freshly amputated arm.

266
00:16:34,094 --> 00:16:36,663
I'm thinking sadomasochist,
probably keeping her alive.

267
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,531
I've got a suspect
named Jordan Arnold.

268
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:39,799
Let me help you
with that.

269
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:41,801
Thanks. I can use a sounding board.

270
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:53,580
Know who lives there?

271
00:16:54,281 --> 00:16:56,249
Cocksucker who cost me my job.

272
00:16:57,717 --> 00:16:59,352
- Fleetwood.
- Yes.

273
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:01,855
City paid off the lawsuit, 1.2 mil.

274
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:04,924
He moved back
just a couple months ago.

275
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:06,760
Son of a bitch.

276
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:09,129
How'd you like to help
me do some good,...

277
00:17:09,129 --> 00:17:10,797
...serve up a little
karmic justice?

278
00:17:10,797 --> 00:17:13,033
- Joe...
- 20 bucks says we bust him...

279
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:14,901
...on a felony
before nightfall.

280
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:18,171
These assholes could win a lottery
and still not keep their noses clean.

281
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:20,874
See that little prick?
He got one over on me, man.

282
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:23,677
- You know that ain't right.
- Yes, I know it's not right.

283
00:17:23,677 --> 00:17:25,011
Then here we go.

284
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:26,713
Lookee here!

285
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,715
<i>- Jesus Christ.
</i>- Bitch that made me rich!

286
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:31,918
You thought it'd be fun to beat on me
like a punk nigga now?

287
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:34,654
- Who's the nigga now?
- Step back!

288
00:17:34,654 --> 00:17:38,291
Yes. Here. Go get yourself
some new gear on me.

289
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:41,528
Go back to your party, burn out
whatever brain cells you got left.

290
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:44,764
Come on. Hit me!
I could use another couple million.

291
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:46,199
Put the
camera down.

292
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:47,701
Come on. Show's
just startin'.

293
00:17:49,436 --> 00:17:51,304
Let go of him! Let go!

294
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:52,339
Back off!

295
00:17:53,173 --> 00:17:54,941
That's all right. I'll
just buy me a new one.

296
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:56,976
What's this?

297
00:17:57,811 --> 00:18:01,281
That's a Palm. Keep it.
Got ten more on order.

298
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:04,784
Why don't you
crawl on back to your crib?

299
00:18:08,021 --> 00:18:11,091
You need a beer,
keg's always on tap.

300
00:18:14,861 --> 00:18:17,030
Yes. This ain't right.

301
00:18:32,045 --> 00:18:33,146
What's the verdict?

302
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,750
Well, other than a few hiccups,
it's looking good.

303
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,984
What hiccups?

304
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:42,389
According to Julien's statement,
he didn't see the shooting.

305
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:44,224
What do you mean?
He was right there!

306
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:46,726
He says he was
in the woman's apartment.

307
00:18:47,494 --> 00:18:49,462
But I wouldn't
worry about it though.

308
00:18:50,096 --> 00:18:51,431
It's going to be a good shoot.

309
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:07,147
- Dutch.
- Jordan's alibi checked out.

310
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:09,416
I ran a records check on
everyone in Kayla's building.

311
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:10,884
- Any hits?
- Two.

312
00:19:10,884 --> 00:19:13,787
A woman passing bad checks
and a Bob Lindhoff.

313
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:16,356
Bob Lindhoff?
I just had him down here.

314
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:20,160
Nine years ago, an attempted
kidnapping charge, later dropped.

315
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:28,535
She's coming to again. Get in the car.

316
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:57,297
I tried to call,
but there was no answer.

317
00:19:57,297 --> 00:20:00,133
We went out to grab a bite to eat.
What's up?

318
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:03,069
I've got a suspect down at the station
I was hoping you could I.D.

319
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:04,337
You mind coming back?

320
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,509
- Is it really necessary?
- Yes, do you mind?

321
00:20:09,943 --> 00:20:12,245
- No, not at all.
- Great. Follow me.

322
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:20,920
Fleetwood's been checkin' in
with his parole officer...

323
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,989
...doin' community service
and scrubbin' graffiti.

324
00:20:22,989 --> 00:20:24,591
Sumbitch is
totally clean.

325
00:20:25,525 --> 00:20:26,626
You?

326
00:20:26,626 --> 00:20:28,795
I ran some of the names
he had in his Palm Pilot.

327
00:20:29,863 --> 00:20:32,232
He had four two-strikers
in his address book.

328
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:34,834
You need a new C.I.?

329
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:35,969
Doesn't everyone?

330
00:20:35,969 --> 00:20:38,905
I'm going to hit the head. Then
we can go do some arm twistin'?

331
00:20:46,145 --> 00:20:48,114
- Vic, we need to talk.
- What's up?

332
00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:50,350
Claudette's got Tio's ledger.

333
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:53,486
He was supposed to burn that.

334
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:55,855
Well, apparently,
Armadillo burned him first.

335
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,425
Claudette wants to run
your financials against Tio's records.

336
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:01,160
Fine. Let her.

337
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,129
- You sure?
- Trust me.

338
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:04,631
She's not going to find anything.

339
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:08,701
What's Joe Clarke
doing here?

340
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:10,503
You know Joe?

341
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:14,007
I remember his picture
in the papers. He can't be here.

342
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:15,909
He's a friend of mine.

343
00:21:17,477 --> 00:21:19,712
And he's also an embarrassment
to this department.

344
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:21,848
So unless he's here
to report a crime...

345
00:21:21,848 --> 00:21:23,983
...I can't allow him
in this building.

346
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,556
I don't know. Makes you think.

347
00:21:29,556 --> 00:21:32,592
Vic says the guy was
a real crackerjack cop.

348
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:34,994
Somebody like him can get booted,
man, none of us are safe.

349
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:37,664
Come on. The guy's old.
Probably lost his edge.

350
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,866
- Nothing's going to happen to us.
- How are you so sure?

351
00:21:39,866 --> 00:21:43,570
Because we're careful.
Because Joe got sloppy and stupid.

352
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:45,505
Stupid?

353
00:21:46,873 --> 00:21:48,007
- Vic, I...
- What's stupid is Joe's...

354
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:49,576
...twice the cop
you'll ever be.

355
00:21:49,576 --> 00:21:51,377
You're too sloppy
to even know it.

356
00:21:52,111 --> 00:21:53,913
- Here we go again.
- I guess so.

357
00:21:55,782 --> 00:21:57,617
You know, I'm gettin'
a little tired of this bullshit.

358
00:21:57,617 --> 00:22:00,353
I'm gettin' tired of constantly having
to clean up after your bullshit!

359
00:22:00,353 --> 00:22:03,323
Every time something goes to shit in
your life, I become your whipping boy.

360
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:04,691
Why don't you find someone else?

361
00:22:04,691 --> 00:22:06,092
Maybe that's exactly what I'll do.

362
00:22:06,092 --> 00:22:07,827
You want my transfer request?

363
00:22:08,595 --> 00:22:10,730
Say the word, Vic! It'll
be on Aceveda's desk...

364
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:11,864
...first thing
in the morning!

365
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:13,700
- Fine. Write it up.
- Fine!

366
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,668
Asshole.

367
00:22:16,135 --> 00:22:17,403
What'd you
call me?

368
00:22:18,571 --> 00:22:19,772
Everything all right?

369
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:22,675
Yes. Just a little spring cleaning.

370
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:24,677
Let's ride.

371
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:49,168
I thought this was about
I.D.'ing somebody.

372
00:22:49,402 --> 00:22:51,671
Actually, we're more interested
in the kidnapping charge...

373
00:22:51,671 --> 00:22:53,973
...that was filed
against you in 1993.

374
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:58,077
That was a misunderstanding.

375
00:22:59,145 --> 00:23:02,014
- You were 35 at the time, right?
- Correct.

376
00:23:02,014 --> 00:23:03,716
And your girlfriend
was in high school?

377
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:05,418
She was 18.

378
00:23:05,418 --> 00:23:08,921
And you took her away on vacation for
two weeks and never told her parents.

379
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:13,226
I know. In hindsight,
it was just a bad judgment call.

380
00:23:14,694 --> 00:23:16,395
But Amanda was an adult.

381
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:19,098
You're 17 years older
than Marcy too.

382
00:23:19,966 --> 00:23:21,667
You like 'em young, Bob?

383
00:23:22,101 --> 00:23:25,404
Yes. They just... feel right.

384
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:27,406
Did Kayla feel right?

385
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:30,042
I wouldn't know.

386
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:34,447
<i>- I know how you feel.
</i>- Excuse me?

387
00:23:35,882 --> 00:23:37,283
What'd your partner do?

388
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,152
He's not backing me up
on the shooting.

389
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,022
If that guy costs
me a promotion...

390
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:45,825
He's not backing you up?

391
00:23:46,692 --> 00:23:48,361
After all I've
covered for him.

392
00:23:48,361 --> 00:23:50,229
You covered for him?
What did he do?

393
00:23:50,463 --> 00:23:51,564
Nothin'.

394
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:56,702
It's cool. You can tell me.

395
00:23:56,702 --> 00:23:59,906
No. It doesn't matter.
I got to get back.

396
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,614
Seeing the way you
stiffed your partner,...

397
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:10,716
...I figure you're just
one big hard-on today.

398
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:12,251
Excuse me?

399
00:24:12,251 --> 00:24:14,453
You know what an
officer-involved shooting means?

400
00:24:15,354 --> 00:24:16,889
It means that we're all involved.

401
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:18,491
I told the truth.

402
00:24:18,491 --> 00:24:20,493
When it comes to your
partner's career...

403
00:24:22,495 --> 00:24:23,863
...the truth is like grits.

404
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:27,767
You don't serve it up plain.
You put a little salt on it.

405
00:24:27,767 --> 00:24:29,268
You goddamn rookies.

406
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:33,272
$20 apiece.
I'll let 'em both go for 35.

407
00:24:33,272 --> 00:24:36,475
That's real... That's like chiffon.
And this look good with your eyes.

408
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,711
And this is silk right here.
This will look real good with...

409
00:24:38,711 --> 00:24:40,079
Drop the
clothes, ladies.

410
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:42,515
Although, you have got
to have that one.

411
00:24:42,515 --> 00:24:44,483
- She's keeping that one for free.
- Wait...

412
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:47,420
- I got receipts for all this, man!
- Yes? That's funny.

413
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,689
I got a police report for it
from Dress For Less.

414
00:24:49,689 --> 00:24:51,691
Dealin' stolen merchandise,
Taylor.

415
00:24:51,691 --> 00:24:54,727
That's your third strike...
before you're 25 years old.

416
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:57,263
That makes you the goddamn
rookie of the year.

417
00:24:57,263 --> 00:25:00,066
I got a little baby at home.
She need milk and books, man.

418
00:25:00,066 --> 00:25:01,834
Only thing you got at home...

419
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:04,737
...is a wide-screen TV
you haven't paid for yet!

420
00:25:08,641 --> 00:25:10,109
Here's your statement. Sign it.

421
00:25:15,047 --> 00:25:17,149
Man. What the hell is this, man?
This is all filled out.

422
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:18,484
You don't
want to sign?

423
00:25:18,484 --> 00:25:21,053
I'll throw you in County right
now on that third strike.

424
00:25:22,455 --> 00:25:24,423
And if I sign this
bullshit confession?

425
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:26,826
Play ball with us,
we'll let you play extra innings.

426
00:25:26,826 --> 00:25:29,128
We know you've been selling
stolen goods to Fleetwood Walker.

427
00:25:29,128 --> 00:25:31,364
Give us a hand, we'll
lose this statement.

428
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:32,865
We'll forget we ever saw you.

429
00:25:33,499 --> 00:25:34,633
Man!

430
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,109
My God.

431
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,845
Why would someone
do this to her?

432
00:25:46,946 --> 00:25:52,318
Most likely trying to fill
a twisted sadomasochistic fantasy.

433
00:25:54,453 --> 00:25:57,456
Why would someone fantasize
about cutting a woman's arm off?

434
00:25:58,424 --> 00:26:00,292
Some people derive
sexual pleasure...

435
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:04,196
...through inflicting
physical, emotional abuse.

436
00:26:05,031 --> 00:26:06,232
That's horrible.

437
00:26:09,035 --> 00:26:10,202
Yes, it is.

438
00:26:12,438 --> 00:26:14,106
How old were you
when you met Bob?

439
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,908
Is he your first
boyfriend?

440
00:26:17,843 --> 00:26:19,211
How did you know?

441
00:26:20,546 --> 00:26:22,348
He made you feel powerful, right?

442
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:28,287
Did he tell you about the attempted
kidnapping charges filed against him?

443
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:32,591
Yes. Why?

444
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:35,394
Bob went to medical school
for two years.

445
00:26:36,996 --> 00:26:38,164
So?

446
00:26:38,364 --> 00:26:39,498
So...

447
00:26:40,499 --> 00:26:43,536
So if a woman had her arm cut off,
he'd know how to keep her alive.

448
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:46,972
God, no.

449
00:26:47,373 --> 00:26:51,444
No. I swear to you.
Bob didn't do anything like that.

450
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:57,383
What'd we get back on the river basins
and the state parks check?

451
00:26:57,383 --> 00:26:59,518
Nothing. We're still waiting
for regional and county.

452
00:26:59,518 --> 00:27:01,220
Call 'em back.
Don't wait on 'em.

453
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:04,957
Bob's cold, manipulative. Always been
with women he could control.

454
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:07,426
Marcy accepts this
'cause she knows no better.

455
00:27:07,426 --> 00:27:08,794
She's been force-fed his
opinions to the point...

456
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:10,596
...she's incapable
of having her own.

457
00:27:11,163 --> 00:27:13,299
Sounds like a surface diagnosis to me.

458
00:27:13,566 --> 00:27:15,734
Believe me, if you'd grown up
in my family for 20 years...

459
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:17,536
you'd recognize it right away too.

460
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:21,574
I'm going to go it on my own on this.

461
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:24,310
Marcy only knows how to
take orders from men like Bob.

462
00:27:25,544 --> 00:27:27,379
I can handle this.

463
00:27:30,916 --> 00:27:32,485
Bob is innocent.

464
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:36,722
I understand.
You're afraid of him.

465
00:27:36,722 --> 00:27:38,491
<i>- I'm not afraid of him.
</i>- It's okay.

466
00:27:38,791 --> 00:27:41,460
I can protect you, but only
if you tell me what he's doing.

467
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,862
He's not doing
anything.

468
00:27:42,862 --> 00:27:44,263
Don't lie to
me, Marcy!

469
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:46,699
- I'm not lying!
- Yes, you are!

470
00:27:46,932 --> 00:27:51,003
Bob tells you how to think,
how to feel, how to act.

471
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:53,105
Without him, you're worthless.
Nothing.

472
00:27:53,105 --> 00:27:55,474
- It's not like that!
- And you won't leave him...

473
00:27:55,474 --> 00:27:57,676
...because you're afraid no one
else will ever love you...

474
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,945
...that you'll learn Bob
was right about you all along.

475
00:27:59,945 --> 00:28:02,014
- No!
- Damn it, Marcy!

476
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:04,283
- Don't lie to me!
- Why are you doing this?

477
00:28:04,283 --> 00:28:07,653
Because there's a girl out there
who may still be alive...

478
00:28:07,653 --> 00:28:09,655
...and I won't let you kill her!

479
00:28:09,655 --> 00:28:15,528
Now, goddamn it!
Tell me right now! Where is she?

480
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:17,296
I don't know!

481
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:20,399
Really! I don't!

482
00:28:27,106 --> 00:28:29,708
I played the daddy.
I broke her.

483
00:28:30,342 --> 00:28:32,444
If she knew Bob was involved,
she would've confessed...

484
00:28:33,245 --> 00:28:35,281
...or at least given me
a nondenial.

485
00:28:35,848 --> 00:28:37,249
You think?

486
00:28:37,249 --> 00:28:38,384
I don't know.

487
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:41,987
Maybe Bob's not
a sadomasochistic thrill killer.

488
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,256
Maybe he's just an asshole.

489
00:28:44,256 --> 00:28:46,792
Problem is, he's the only
asshole we've got.

490
00:29:01,674 --> 00:29:03,075
Well, what do
you got for me?

491
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:04,610
What you got for me?

492
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:07,446
Come on. Embrace the relationship.

493
00:29:09,014 --> 00:29:10,749
Fleetwood is fencin' again.

494
00:29:12,651 --> 00:29:14,420
He's so goddamn predictable.

495
00:29:14,887 --> 00:29:16,055
What's he movin'?

496
00:29:16,455 --> 00:29:18,624
Just, you know, warehouse
electronics, man.

497
00:29:18,624 --> 00:29:21,794
CDs, TVs, DVDs.
Same stuff as before.

498
00:29:21,794 --> 00:29:23,329
Where's he keeping his stash?

499
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:25,931
Are you going to hold this
third strike over me...

500
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:27,032
...for the rest
of my life?

501
00:29:28,534 --> 00:29:32,905
I could lie to you, but I have far too
much respect for you as a person.

502
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,040
Yes, I am.

503
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:42,047
Here is your authorization to check
Mackey's financial records.

504
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:46,452
Thanks.
Hope we don't find anything.

505
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,255
I just hope you find the truth.

506
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,968
Joe. It's Vic.

507
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,248
Can you believe
I walked out on them?

508
00:30:18,284 --> 00:30:20,686
When they left,
I thought it'd be easier.

509
00:30:20,686 --> 00:30:24,123
I thought they'd miss me
more than I'd miss them.

510
00:30:24,123 --> 00:30:25,791
Guess I'm the shithead?

511
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:29,595
Stacy still on
the swim team?

512
00:30:29,962 --> 00:30:31,897
Yes, I think so. Yes.

513
00:30:32,765 --> 00:30:35,301
Yes, she... Damn it!

514
00:30:36,235 --> 00:30:38,037
I didn't want you
to see me like this.

515
00:30:38,237 --> 00:30:39,605
Broke, with
nothing.

516
00:30:40,272 --> 00:30:41,774
What about your pension?

517
00:30:41,774 --> 00:30:43,976
Damn lawyers for
the civil suit ate it up.

518
00:30:43,976 --> 00:30:45,244
What about the stuff
you took on the side?

519
00:30:45,244 --> 00:30:46,779
I guess I didn't take enough.

520
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,449
Always so careful.
Never wanted to get caught.

521
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,518
Joe, you can't
live like this.

522
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:54,553
Sure I can. The
truth is,...

523
00:30:54,553 --> 00:30:56,388
...the people we save from the
worst day of their lives...

524
00:30:56,388 --> 00:30:58,624
...never got to see us
when we have to face ours.

525
00:30:58,991 --> 00:31:02,494
Hell, and why should they?
We took the job, not them.

526
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:03,896
No, that's
not right.

527
00:31:03,896 --> 00:31:05,764
What you going
to do, man?

528
00:31:05,764 --> 00:31:07,499
I'll tell you
what we're going to do.

529
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:10,135
Fleetwood's got a warehouse
full of stolen merch.

530
00:31:10,135 --> 00:31:11,303
No.

531
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:15,607
I say we nail him.
Sell half the stash to my new C.I.

532
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:18,344
- We get you some new digs.
- I can't let you do that, all right?

533
00:31:18,344 --> 00:31:21,747
I'm just... I'm just
trying to do some good.

534
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,551
You know, and deliver
some karmic justice.

535
00:31:26,518 --> 00:31:28,053
Now are you in, or are you out?

536
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:48,207
Easy. Don't suck on his tailpipe.

537
00:31:57,383 --> 00:31:58,650
One second.

538
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,953
- Yes.
- It's me.

539
00:32:00,953 --> 00:32:02,755
- Where are you?
- <i>Home.</i>

540
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:05,924
- What, our home?
- <i>Yes. The keys still work.</i>

541
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:09,762
- Are the kids with you?
- Yes. We're all here.

542
00:32:10,462 --> 00:32:11,864
Thank you.

543
00:32:11,864 --> 00:32:14,500
- This doesn't change things.
- <i>I know.</i>

544
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,902
- When can I see them?
- Now?

545
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:20,806
I got to finish up somethin' first.
I'll be right there.

546
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:24,476
- Okay.
- Okay.

547
00:32:29,982 --> 00:32:31,750
Looks like he's making a deposit.

548
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,852
Yes, you got to love good intel.

549
00:32:34,653 --> 00:32:36,588
Stay here. Watch my back.

550
00:32:50,669 --> 00:32:52,271
<i>This is for my boy down the street.</i>

551
00:32:54,506 --> 00:32:57,075
Fully automatic. You know
what I get for those on the street?

552
00:32:57,075 --> 00:33:01,146
Drop it! Drop it! Drop it!
Fingers interlaced!

553
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:04,082
Palms on the back
of your head. Now!

554
00:33:07,886 --> 00:33:09,755
Come on, man! Let's move! Let's move!

555
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,065
- Vic!
- Stay back!

556
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:43,088
Vic! You
been hit?

557
00:33:43,088 --> 00:33:44,590
I'm all right. Get out of here.

558
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:46,024
I'm going to kill
that son of a bitch.

559
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,159
- Just get out of here.
- No, no.

560
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:49,394
- I'm not ditching you, man.
- You're not ditching me.

561
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:51,396
I can't explain
you being here to Aceveda.

562
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:55,634
Now, go! Just call an ambulance
and call my family!

563
00:33:55,634 --> 00:33:57,236
I'm going to kill that sumbitch!

564
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:02,641
No. No. Don't.

565
00:34:16,255 --> 00:34:18,690
Goddamn it!

566
00:34:25,464 --> 00:34:28,400
Christ. I hate playing this with you.

567
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:32,805
- This game's sucking.
- You could stop.

568
00:34:33,372 --> 00:34:34,573
Shut up.

569
00:34:35,307 --> 00:34:36,542
It's Vic.

570
00:34:39,511 --> 00:34:41,046
What's up, boss?

571
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:46,919
Jesus Christ. Are you okay?

572
00:34:47,386 --> 00:34:49,988
- What?
- Vic got shot.

573
00:34:49,988 --> 00:34:51,457
- What?
- Vic got shot.

574
00:34:55,394 --> 00:34:56,762
Can we leave?

575
00:34:56,762 --> 00:34:58,163
Shouldn't be much longer.

576
00:34:58,964 --> 00:35:00,099
Please.

577
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:02,634
Don't walk out on me again.

578
00:35:05,204 --> 00:35:07,639
Just please don't leave me alone.

579
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,011
Look...

580
00:35:15,514 --> 00:35:16,949
I believe you.

581
00:35:17,716 --> 00:35:20,119
Maybe Bob did this
without you knowing.

582
00:35:22,688 --> 00:35:25,657
I was with him all night.

583
00:35:26,158 --> 00:35:29,094
If I thought he did this,
I would tell you. I would.

584
00:35:32,765 --> 00:35:33,999
I know you would.

585
00:35:40,539 --> 00:35:42,941
- Who did this to you?
- Fleetwood.

586
00:35:42,941 --> 00:35:45,544
That prick that got Joe
kicked off the force?

587
00:35:45,544 --> 00:35:47,813
Yes. Joe's goin' after him.
You got to stop him.

588
00:35:48,113 --> 00:35:49,248
Okay.

589
00:35:50,282 --> 00:35:51,717
You got to stop him.

590
00:35:52,351 --> 00:35:54,453
- Come on, guys. We're losing blood.
- Just hang in there.

591
00:35:54,453 --> 00:35:56,522
- Got to go.
- Just hang in there.

592
00:36:00,993 --> 00:36:02,428
Detective Wyms, Carlson just called.

593
00:36:02,428 --> 00:36:05,531
There's a homeless guy with a bloody
machete saying he killed somebody.

594
00:36:05,531 --> 00:36:08,100
- Where?
- Just south of Bell on Vine.

595
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:11,370
That's a block from Kayla's apartment.
Where's Dutch?

596
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:13,972
I don't know. Maybe he's checking
in on Vic. Have you heard anything?

597
00:36:13,972 --> 00:36:17,276
Not yet. Find Dutch.
Tell him to meet me there.

598
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,816
Excuse me. Excuse me.
They got the guy?

599
00:36:24,216 --> 00:36:26,618
- Sir, put the knife down, please.
- I'll kill again!

600
00:36:26,618 --> 00:36:29,054
<i>- Drop your weapon!
</i>- I killed them all!

601
00:36:29,054 --> 00:36:32,591
J.F.K., R.F.K., M.L.K.

602
00:36:32,591 --> 00:36:34,126
Carlson, got bean bags?

603
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:36,528
- Locked and loaded.
- Run D.M.C.!

604
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:38,697
That's the guy?
He's a nut.

605
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:40,632
I was told he had
a bloody machete.

606
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:41,900
I called in a kitchen knife.

607
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,635
- For Christ's sakes.
- I was told to call...

608
00:36:43,635 --> 00:36:44,736
...if I found
anything.

609
00:36:44,736 --> 00:36:46,705
End this! Come on.

610
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:50,209
- My God!
- Just a bean bag, ma'am.

611
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:53,645
Let's get back to
Bob and Marcy.

612
00:36:53,645 --> 00:36:55,380
- I released them.
- You what?

613
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,115
I thought we had the guy here.

614
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:01,019
Bob didn't do it.
Marcy would've told me.

615
00:37:02,688 --> 00:37:05,858
Stay still for me, sir. That's it.

616
00:37:06,425 --> 00:37:08,060
- I'm his boss. How is he?
- He's going to live,...

617
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,461
...but we need him in surgery.

618
00:37:09,461 --> 00:37:10,929
Not until I see my kids.

619
00:37:10,929 --> 00:37:12,397
Vic, don't be stupid.

620
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:14,766
They're on their way here.
They're going to be here any second.

621
00:37:15,067 --> 00:37:16,702
- Vic.
- Where are they?

622
00:37:17,069 --> 00:37:18,837
- They're in the waiting room.
- I got to see 'em.

623
00:37:18,837 --> 00:37:21,340
- I won't let you. Not like this.
- Corrine...

624
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,342
I don't want them
to be scared.

625
00:37:25,344 --> 00:37:26,545
They won't be.

626
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:28,680
Vic.

627
00:37:30,516 --> 00:37:31,850
Daddy!

628
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:33,418
Hi.

629
00:37:33,852 --> 00:37:34,786
Daddy.

630
00:37:37,389 --> 00:37:38,991
I missed you so much.

631
00:37:39,558 --> 00:37:40,626
Kiss.

632
00:37:42,494 --> 00:37:43,595
Matty.

633
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,031
Give Daddy a kiss.

634
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:50,202
Vic, I really
need you in here now.

635
00:37:50,202 --> 00:37:51,537
Dad, don't go again.

636
00:37:51,537 --> 00:37:53,939
Honey, I'm sorry. I have to.

637
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:55,774
Listen, someone was
hurt really bad...

638
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:58,010
...and I have to stay here
until he feels better.

639
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:01,813
But as soon as I can, I'm going
to come and see you again, okay?

640
00:38:01,813 --> 00:38:03,215
I promise.

641
00:38:03,215 --> 00:38:04,349
I love you.

642
00:38:36,915 --> 00:38:38,016
Where is he?

643
00:38:39,151 --> 00:38:40,252
- Who?
-Fleetwood.

644
00:38:40,252 --> 00:38:42,888
You're packing his goddamn suitcase.
Now, where is he?

645
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:46,191
- I forget.
- Where's your boyfriend at?

646
00:38:46,191 --> 00:38:48,760
- I don't even hear you.
- He just shot my partner.

647
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,796
Where is he?
Where is he?

648
00:38:50,796 --> 00:38:52,130
What are you going
to do, hit me?

649
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:55,634
- I don't see any witnesses here.
- Yes? Let my bruises do the talking.

650
00:38:55,634 --> 00:38:58,437
Don't make me do something
that we both don't want me to do.

651
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:02,207
- Yes? Go ahead.
- Just tell me where he is!

652
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:04,643
Please. Just tell me where he is.

653
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:09,781
Go ahead and whack me, you cracker
prick. I'll make my own million.

654
00:39:10,215 --> 00:39:11,483
Is that what you want?

655
00:39:11,483 --> 00:39:12,718
Is that what you really want?

656
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,056
- All right, let's go. Let's go.
- What? What are you...

657
00:39:22,094 --> 00:39:23,161
Come here!

658
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:25,464
No! Let go of me!

659
00:39:26,198 --> 00:39:27,966
- Leave me alone!
- Open up!

660
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,202
<i>What's goin'on in there?</i>

661
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:32,871
<i>Shane, come on!</i>

662
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:36,008
You and me, we're about
to get real acquainted...

663
00:39:36,008 --> 00:39:37,576
...if you don't
start remembering.

664
00:39:37,576 --> 00:39:39,011
Don't touch me!

665
00:39:39,011 --> 00:39:40,846
Where is he?

666
00:39:40,846 --> 00:39:43,248
- Open up!
- Let go of me!

667
00:39:44,182 --> 00:39:46,051
You don't want to tell me?

668
00:39:46,051 --> 00:39:47,352
Damn it! Open the door!

669
00:39:47,352 --> 00:39:49,521
Just let go of me!

670
00:39:50,288 --> 00:39:54,760
Well, maybe I should just let my xxxx
do the talking. How about that?

671
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,662
Open the goddamn door!

672
00:39:56,662 --> 00:39:57,729
Shane, come on!

673
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:00,799
- Where is he? Where is he?
- Okay!

674
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:05,370
He told me to meet him
at the stash house.

675
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:08,440
- Where?
- Open up! Come on!

676
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,308
Near the bridge.

677
00:40:15,947 --> 00:40:17,182
- <i>You're freaking me out!
</i>- You have no idea...

678
00:40:17,182 --> 00:40:18,817
...what you just
missed, darlin'.

679
00:40:20,385 --> 00:40:21,486
<i>Come on!</i>

680
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:37,803
Couldn't split town before you
picked up the merchandise?

681
00:40:39,738 --> 00:40:42,140
<i>You were always
</i>such an idiot, Fleetwood.

682
00:40:43,341 --> 00:40:44,443
Weren't you?

683
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:46,044
You can't arrest me.

684
00:40:46,044 --> 00:40:48,714
I'm not here to arrest you.

685
00:41:06,431 --> 00:41:10,135
- Drop it! Put that on the ground!
- You heard him!

686
00:41:10,135 --> 00:41:13,338
Now! Turn around!
Turn around!

687
00:41:16,608 --> 00:41:18,210
Your girlfriend gave you up, man.

688
00:41:18,877 --> 00:41:21,079
She couldn't resist my charms.

689
00:41:23,014 --> 00:41:24,382
You found
something?

690
00:41:24,382 --> 00:41:25,784
Yes. Over here.

691
00:41:26,618 --> 00:41:29,454
While I was checking
the bathroom, this tile fell off.

692
00:41:32,023 --> 00:41:33,892
It looks directly into
Kayla's bathroom.

693
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:43,301
God. We got
to get an A.P.B. out on their car.

694
00:41:46,905 --> 00:41:48,206
Jesus.

695
00:41:49,441 --> 00:41:50,776
You okay?

696
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:53,612
Better than you.

697
00:42:01,787 --> 00:42:03,922
Looks like I taught you
my last lesson?

698
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:08,293
Don't end up like me.

699
00:42:18,537 --> 00:42:20,238
I shouldn't have
dragged you into this.

700
00:42:20,972 --> 00:42:23,642
Going after that guy
was the right thing to do.

701
00:42:26,444 --> 00:42:27,779
Hell, I got
you shot.

702
00:42:27,779 --> 00:42:30,816
I always knew there was a
bullet with my name on it.

703
00:42:31,349 --> 00:42:35,320
And guess what?
I'm still here.

704
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:40,458
So are you.

705
00:42:47,799 --> 00:42:50,101
You really ought
to get in there and see him.

706
00:42:50,101 --> 00:42:53,238
Yes. Me and Vic aren't
really talkin' right now.

707
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:55,307
He'd want to see you.

708
00:42:56,575 --> 00:42:59,244
- Yes?
- Yes.

709
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:10,322
What the hell is going on?

710
00:43:10,322 --> 00:43:12,290
We found the peephole, Bob.

711
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:14,259
What are you talking about?
This is ridiculous.

712
00:43:14,259 --> 00:43:15,560
Step away!

713
00:43:18,463 --> 00:43:19,631
It's clean.

714
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:22,300
Pop it.

715
00:43:42,587 --> 00:43:43,755
She's dead.

716
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:47,993
She didn't like the way
I looked at Kayla.

717
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:51,363
And the arm was her idea.

718
00:43:52,597 --> 00:43:55,667
She was in the trunk?
The whole time?

719
00:43:57,636 --> 00:43:59,404
Marcy, why didn't you tell me?

720
00:44:01,473 --> 00:44:02,707
Marcy.

721
00:44:04,876 --> 00:44:06,411
Sorry, Daddy.

722
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:29,200
Shane.

723
00:44:31,436 --> 00:44:33,004
When we retire...

724
00:44:34,205 --> 00:44:36,908
...we're going to play golf
together every day.

725
00:44:38,543 --> 00:44:40,111
I never played golf.

726
00:44:43,315 --> 00:44:44,916
I'll teach you.

727
00:44:46,318 --> 00:44:47,819
I'd really like that.
