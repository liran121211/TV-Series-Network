00:00:00,834 --> 00:00:01,968
<i>Previously on The Shield:</i>

2
00:00:01,968 --> 00:00:04,804
-I need that money.
-Yeah? We all do.

3
00:00:04,804 --> 00:00:07,574
No, I need it now to get back my kids.

4
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:10,377
-What are you talking about?
-They're gone, Shane!

5
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:13,179
My guy in Denver got a hit on
Corrine's driver's license.

6
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:15,615
-That's them, isn't it?
-Yeah, that's them.

7
00:00:15,615 --> 00:00:16,616
We're gonna get them, Vic.

8
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:21,488
No!

9
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:24,657
These dead guys may have been cooked
up by a couple of Mexican nationals.

10
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:27,794
Contero; they're brothers,
Navaro and Armadillo.

11
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:29,763
-Armadillo Contero.
-Yes?

12
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:33,633
You're a prime suspect in the fire
murders of two men last night.

13
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:36,369
You're not here to fight the
Torros and the Los Mags.

14
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:37,537
You're here to unit 'em.

15
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,472
-Where are you going?
-Tijuana.

16
00:00:39,472 --> 00:00:40,774
Mexico. What for?

17
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:44,577
Someone's puttin' poison coke out
on our streets. I'm gonna stop 'em.

18
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:47,580
Isn't this what your brother Armadillo
does to people who don't cooperate?

19
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,383
The feds want him. I say we can
let him start doin' his time.

20
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:51,851
Quesedilla.

21
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:56,489
I just wanted to give your little
brother somethin' to remember you by.

22
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:59,793
You're not after Mackey, are you?
You're after me.

23
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:01,795
You have enemies on
the City Council.

24
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:03,530
Her name's Lanie Kellis.

25
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,999
And as much as I'd love to
see her take you down,...

26
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:07,534
...I don't need a scandal right now.

27
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:08,968
You're gonna watch my back.

28
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:10,303
Until the election.

29
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:11,738
In exchange for what?

30
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:16,276
You get your head back in the game.
Get your boys under control.

31
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:18,011
I guess we have a deal.

32
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:19,546
This doesn't mean I like you.

33
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:07,393
Police. Hold it right there.

34
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:10,597
-Hands up. Against the car.
-Turn around.

35
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:15,401
-I didn't do nothing, man.
-Buenos noches, muchachas.

36
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:20,507
-Nice boa.
-Si?

37
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:25,044
New tags, new ink.

38
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:26,546
What's up with that, Chapa?

39
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:31,017
We're just changing brands.
Torrucos now.

40
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:32,452
Torrucos now?

41
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:36,256
Armadillo's calling you guys?

42
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,466
Armadillo's bro looks good
behind bars?

43
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:00,847
You tell him I called.

44
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:22,635
Someone torched
Tio's drug crib.

45
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:26,172
-What if our blow was in there?
-Then it's gone.

46
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:28,541
Hey, we got a lot of
bread tied up in that shipment.

47
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,944
You're so worried about your
goddamn money you don't get it.

48
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,713
This could open up
an investigation into Tio's business.

49
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,416
If we're not careful,
all roads are gonna lead back to us.

50
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:39,085
Go find Tio.
I'll take care of this.

51
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:40,820
Let's just call Lem.
I'll stay here and help.

52
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,388
Did I ask for your help?

53
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:46,192
-Hey.
-Morning, gentlemen.

54
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:48,461
-Guess I missed the weenie roast.
-What happened?

55
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:51,531
Arson. Started on the first floor.
Then the whole place went up.

56
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:53,433
They were able
to determine that already?

57
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:57,003
Whoever set the fire didn't try to
hide it. Gas can out back.

58
00:03:57,537 --> 00:03:59,872
-What brings you here?
-My case.

59
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:03,042
We found the same graffiti
as the necklace tire executions.

60
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:06,646
-Do we have a motive yet?
-That's not all we have.

61
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:11,651
-Is that a kid?
-Not exactly.

62
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,492
I'm shaking down
the new king cholo.

63
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:24,564
Armadillo. I gave my card to
a few of his recruits.

64
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:27,333
I guess they weren't kosher.
Armadillo's my case.

65
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:30,903
He raped a 12-year-old girl last
night to cover the tire murders.

66
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:33,439
He raped a kid? Why isn't
he in Central by now?

67
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,108
Her brother's uncooperative.

68
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,276
I think he took her
back to Mexico.

69
00:04:37,276 --> 00:04:39,112
No victim, no arrest.

70
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:43,916
-Why would he burn this building?
-I spoke to some of the locals.

71
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:47,353
It appears the owner
is a Theodore Osmond.

72
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:49,922
He's selling more than
comic books. Drug dealer.

73
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:54,093
Armadillo burns out his competition
and sends me a message.

74
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:55,695
Me and my boys'll handle this.

75
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:58,798
Hey, I'm just giving you information.
This is my case.

76
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:01,968
You see that little piggy
with my card spiked to its head?

77
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,504
This is gangland...
my domain.

78
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:05,672
I'm already on it.

79
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:07,040
<i>Detective, let me
</i>show you something.

80
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:11,177
Any reason why the two of you
shouldn't pair up together?

81
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:14,013
I just think it would make more sense
if I handled this on my own.

82
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:18,251
You're gonna see some
kind of kicking and...

83
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:19,686
...screaming you didn't
know existed...

84
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:22,255
-...you try pulling me off this.
-You both want it.

85
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:25,191
It's big enough for the two of you.
Work it together.

86
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:26,626
-Fine.
-Great.

87
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:52,152
Hold. Maybe the doorbell works.

88
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:59,326
-Armadillo.
-What's this about?

89
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:01,194
It's all about love, ese.

90
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,299
Come on, boys. Let's go for a walk.

91
00:06:05,299 --> 00:06:06,633
You heard him. Let's go.

92
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:13,040
Where were you...

93
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,342
I was with some friends
when the fire was set.

94
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:17,210
I'll give you their names.

95
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,149
You and your brother
are into a lot of things.

96
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:24,651
Pimping drugs,
consolidating chulitos.

97
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:26,753
No, I'm not like my brother.

98
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:30,757
Navaro enjoys parties,
late nights.

99
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:34,861
I'm much more comfortable in bed
with a good book to read.

100
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:36,596
And a little girl to rape.

101
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:43,103
I have no outstanding warrants.
My visas are in perfect order.

102
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:46,273
There are no drugs, guns
or money in the house.

103
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:48,842
If you're such a good boy
then you do as I say.

104
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:53,480
Pack up your shit and get on the next
donkey back to home.

105
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:59,920
No. I just got here. I want
to be staying for a while?

106
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:05,392
Fine.

107
00:07:06,193 --> 00:07:07,995
Maybe you can stay at my
house for a little while.

108
00:07:07,995 --> 00:07:09,563
What's the charge?

109
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:11,331
I'll think of something on the way.

110
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:15,002
Anyone of you guys
not named Martinez?

111
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:18,271
This guy Perez, his license expired
eight months ago. I'm calling it in.

112
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,475
What's up with that, Xavier?
Lines too long at the D.M.V.?

113
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:24,277
Yeah, okay. This guy Xavier, man.

114
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,446
He's got an outstanding warrant
for aggravated assault.

115
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,815
Now we got you
for harboring a felon.

116
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,955
For my wall, right
next to your brother.

117
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,256
Can I get a copy?

118
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:42,195
This guy's got a notorious reputation,
but his rap sheet's squeaky clean.

119
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:44,731
Unlike his brother, he's smart.
No mistakes so far.

120
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:46,633
-Good morning.
-Morning.

121
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:50,003
Have you met our civilian auditor?
Claudette Wyms. Lanie Kellis.

122
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:52,239
-Hello.
-Hi. Another one?

123
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:56,676
Yeah. The brother of that Mexican
national. If anything, he's worse.

124
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:59,880
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to interrupt.

125
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,249
Well, not at all.
I was just saying that...

126
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:04,151
...unless we get this guy
on something else,...

127
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:06,153
...the harboring charges
won't hold him.

128
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,021
I know. So does he.

129
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:11,124
We have to find the guy who set
the fire, connect it to Armadillo...

130
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:12,692
...then get him for the arson.

131
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:14,661
I want him
for more than that.

132
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:20,100
We'll start with the shop owner.
You know where I can find him?

133
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,502
-No.
-Really?

134
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,672
'Cause it says Theodore
Osmond is registered...

135
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:28,675
...as one of your
confidential informants.

136
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:33,947
Tio.
I haven't seen him in months.

137
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:38,185
Theodore Osmond? That's his real name?

138
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:40,220
I'll get the word out.

139
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:43,290
Meantime, I'll have my guys
hunt down the firebug.

140
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:44,257
Good.

141
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:46,993
I'd like to observe
Detective Mackey on this.

142
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:48,662
Sure. Give us a chance to talk.

143
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:50,864
Actually, I was just
coming to get you.

144
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,133
-A city official has just been shot.
-Who?

145
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:54,768
I don't have all the details,...

146
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:57,003
...but I'm sure your people
will want you down there.

147
00:08:57,003 --> 00:09:00,807
-Dutch, you've met Lanie Kellis?
-Of course.

148
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:04,177
We've got a city official
shot at Benton and Hollis.

149
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:06,046
I need you
down there right away.

150
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:09,015
-Lanie's gonna ride along.
-Great.

151
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:11,418
About you,
not the city official.

152
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:13,987
-Do we know who the victim is?
-Not yet.

153
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:17,057
-Okay. You ready? Let's go.
-I...

154
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,391
I guess so.

155
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,764
You have a connection
with the drug dealer...

156
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:26,233
...whose place just
got burnt down?

157
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,335
-Yeah.
-Jesus Christ.

158
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:32,539
I asked you if there was any reason
not to bring Claudette into this.

159
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:35,242
Hey, you're the politician. Learn
to read between the goddamn lines.

160
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:38,345
I told you I wanted
to handle this thing myself.

161
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,547
What does this mean for us?

162
00:09:42,516 --> 00:09:44,417
It just means
I'll have to be careful.

163
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:49,489
Tio's laying low at his kid's
mom's place. He's spooked.

164
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:54,094
How long you freezing us out?

165
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,695
Until I can trust the
three of you again.

166
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:58,265
-Look, I'm really sorry, boss.
-Me too.

167
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:00,700
-We made a mistake.
-Yeah, you did.

168
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:04,905
I need one of you to come with me.
I don't give a damn which one.

169
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:14,548
-You wanna go higher?
-No. No higher.

170
00:10:14,548 --> 00:10:16,016
Okay.

171
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:19,853
All right. Come on.

172
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:21,688
Go inside
with your mom, baby.

173
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:24,024
Beautiful kid.

174
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:27,761
Hi. You okay?

175
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:29,095
No.

176
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,698
A Mexican psycho torched
my goddamn building.

177
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:32,899
Yeah, we saw.

178
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:34,467
What'd you lose?

179
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,970
I got lucky. Most of the product
was cut, bagged, and out.

180
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,838
I had some cash and
my records in the safe.

181
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:41,107
-What safe?
-What records?

182
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:43,310
Accounts ledger... income,
expenses, you know.

183
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,444
No, I don't know.

184
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:46,846
I'm running a business. I gotta know
what's coming in and going out.

185
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:50,951
Going out? Like payments to me?
My name is in that goddamn ledger?

186
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:53,653
It's in code, man.
I call you "Landlord."

187
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,021
Hey, you and your
boys didn't have...

188
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,356
...a problem with the
way I do business...

189
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:57,924
...when I damn near doubled your cut.

190
00:10:57,924 --> 00:10:59,125
Where's the safe?

191
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,995
Back room of the shop. One of
those corporate espionage deals.

192
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,863
You try to force it open,
it destroys the contents.

193
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:05,332
All right, all right.
I'll get the safe.

194
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:06,967
-And I'll get Armadillo.
-No.

195
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:08,969
Someone in my squad is
tryin' to track you down.

196
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:10,403
Connect you to the Mexican.

197
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:12,539
-I want you to stay here and lay low.
-This can't go unanswered.

198
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:16,276
It won't. I need a couple
of your guys, names and numbers.

199
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:18,144
Guys that know
how to use a Zippo.

200
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:22,449
Find out where the
Torrucos are hanging.

201
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:23,350
Want us to roust them?

202
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:27,254
No. Give them this address.
Tell them to burn it on my signal.

203
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:31,791
And just the building. No bodies. I
wanna send a message, not start a war.

204
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,260
You think you can handle that?

205
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,632
-It's locked.
-Have Lem pick you up.

206
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:44,170
Need to use my phone?

207
00:11:54,648 --> 00:11:57,050
It's pretty quiet
for the shooting of a city official.

208
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,420
I figured there'd be some news crews,
at least one of the independents.

209
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,223
Ray, what do we know?

210
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:06,960
The victim was Helen Zamorski.
Shot three times in the back.

211
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,895
No witnesses. No weapon.

212
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:11,398
-Took her to Mission Cross.
-Helen Zamorski.

213
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,433
-Who is she?
-P.E.O.

214
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:16,336
-P.E.O.?
-Parking enforcement officer.

215
00:12:17,671 --> 00:12:20,640
A meter maid?
You gotta be shitting me.

216
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,242
This is her machine right here.

217
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,077
This is our city official?

218
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:30,083
Will you get your captain
on the phone for me, please?

219
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,830
Hey. Got a call from
the fire inspector.

220
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,965
The safe was in
the back of the shop.

221
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,202
Cocaine residue and scales
were found upstairs.

222
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:51,871
That will give us probable cause
for the search and seizure.

223
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:53,873
Nice work.

224
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:57,644
-Can't wait to see what's inside.
-That makes two of us.

225
00:12:57,644 --> 00:12:58,745
What do we have?

226
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:01,181
The building's owner was
definitely peddling.

227
00:13:01,181 --> 00:13:03,316
He's M.I.A.,
but we found his safe.

228
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:06,252
Maybe there's something inside
to tie Armadillo to him.

229
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:08,855
Tio's no saint,
but he's the victim here.

230
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:10,757
We have to go after Armadillo.

231
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:12,559
Get whoever set that
fire to roll on him.

232
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:16,696
I know Tio's your C.I.,
but Armadillo hit him for a reason.

233
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:18,598
Motive's a pretty good
starting point.

234
00:13:18,598 --> 00:13:20,467
I'll get a warrant
to open the safe.

235
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:22,702
-I got a guy who can crack that.
-Great.

236
00:13:22,702 --> 00:13:25,972
-Any luck finding Tio?
-We got a couple of leads.

237
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:36,282
-What do you got?
-An address in Colorado Springs.

238
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:41,020
-Where?
-She's staying with a Camille Briskin.

239
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,457
-Some chick she went to college with.
-My kids with her?

240
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,593
I'm on the next flight.

241
00:13:47,794 --> 00:13:49,562
I just talked to my guy there.

242
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:52,966
-She's packing up to go someplace.
-Packing?

243
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:56,236
-Did this guy spook her?
-No, look. I trust him.

244
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:59,172
Let him stay on her.
Look, you go there now...

245
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,274
she's liable to be someplace
else by the time you land.

246
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:03,743
Let's just see how it plays out.

247
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:06,913
All right.

248
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:12,285
-My mom's the one that called.
-Yeah? Is your mom around?

249
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:13,286
Yeah.

250
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:14,788
Ma'am, are you the
one that called us?

251
00:14:14,788 --> 00:14:17,157
-About apartment two.
-What's the problem?

252
00:14:17,157 --> 00:14:19,692
-There's a terrorist in there.
-Terrorist?

253
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,094
Tell them about the smells.

254
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:23,730
Chemicals, like he's makin'
dirty bombs or something.

255
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,099
My babies sleep
on the other side of that wall.

256
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:31,638
Look. I'm trying to raise
two boys by myself.

257
00:14:31,638 --> 00:14:35,041
-Now I gotta deal with these people?
-Okay. Fine. We'll check it out.

258
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,743
I should come with you.

259
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:38,645
No, ma'am.
You should stay right here.

260
00:14:50,457 --> 00:14:52,992
-Mr. Al-Thani?
-Zayed, yes.

261
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:55,495
Zayed, I'm Officer Sofer.
This is Officer Lowe.

262
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:58,231
-Yes?
-We've received a complaint.

263
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,933
A complaint? About me?

264
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,704
It's her. She told you I was
a terrorist, didn't she?

265
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:06,039
Sir, if we could just come in...

266
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:09,776
I did nothing wrong. You people
pick on me for no reason.

267
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:12,312
Okay. Just let us come in,
take a quick look around.

268
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:13,446
So.

269
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:16,483
I am a suspect
just because I am Arab?

270
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:18,351
No, sir. You're a
suspect because 19 guys...

271
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:19,819
...who look like your
twin brother...

272
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:21,588
...killed 3,000 Americans.

273
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:27,827
Look, the easiest way for us to
handle this is just let us come in,...

274
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:29,562
...take a look around.

275
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:32,065
Or we can file a report
with the federal government...

276
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:33,566
...and let them check you out.

277
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:41,941
-God bless America.
-After you, sir.

278
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:51,017
My brother sends it
to me from home.

279
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:54,387
-I cannot control what they print.
-Where's home?

280
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:56,189
Damascus.

281
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:57,624
How long have you
been in this country?

282
00:15:57,624 --> 00:16:01,227
Five years. I have a job.
I pay taxes.

283
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:06,266
My wife.

284
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:16,276
-What you making?
-Pickled fish.

285
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,053
Well, thank you.
We appreciate your cooperation.

286
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:30,657
So you will tell the black one
that I am no terrorist?

287
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:31,891
We'll tell her.

288
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:37,096
I found out where
Armadillo's boys are working from.

289
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:41,367
The old Sugar Cube Lounge on Juniper.
Salsa by night, distribution by day.

290
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,069
I doubt they have permits.

291
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:47,840
Go in. Tell them you're
with Alcohol Control. Close it down.

292
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,476
Have Tio's boys light it up
once it's all clear.

293
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:54,013
Hey, Vic. We got a positive I.D.
on Armadillo's fire starter.

294
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:57,584
-Ripley Verdugo. He's, flame retarded.
-Bring him in.

295
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:05,024
Hey, Vic. Shane told me
about your family splittin'.

296
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,326
I'm really sorry, man.

297
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:11,664
Are you an idiot?

298
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:16,169
-Smith, you old drunk.
-Mackey, you bald bastard.

299
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:19,038
-What are you doing?
-Same old. You look good, man.

300
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,106
How's the brood?

301
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:22,675
They're good. So Shane
brought you up to speed?

302
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:24,777
Yeah. You need me
to open some safe?

303
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:27,614
Right. Only I need you
to go through the front lock.

304
00:17:27,614 --> 00:17:30,450
The boys said it's a smart safe.
By going through the lock...

305
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,919
...it'll trigger the acid
and destroy whatever's inside.

306
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:37,323
I get it.

307
00:17:38,358 --> 00:17:40,793
Smith. This is Detective Wyms.

308
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:43,029
Smith the locksmith?
That's convenient.

309
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:44,163
Yeah, I get that.

310
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,371
-Looks like the Omni 600 series.
-Actually, it's the 700 series.

311
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:53,873
Right.

312
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:03,182
Hold on. The manufacturer said
you gotta go through the back to...

313
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:05,118
...disarm the destruct
mechanism.

314
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:09,656
What the hell's going on, man?

315
00:18:09,656 --> 00:18:11,391
I thought you'd worked
on these things before.

316
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:15,595
Yeah, sorry.

317
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:17,797
I'll go through the back.

318
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:21,234
-Good catch.
-Yeah.

319
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:26,406
It would take more than a few bullets
to bring down Officer Zamorski.

320
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:29,008
Officer Zamorski?
She's a meter maid.

321
00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:30,710
We're all officers here.

322
00:18:31,244 --> 00:18:33,646
You know how much revenue
we bring in for this city?

323
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:37,183
If it wasn't for people like Helen
Zamorski risking her life every day...

324
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:40,153
...you guys would be making
less than schoolteachers.

325
00:18:40,153 --> 00:18:42,121
And we appreciate it.

326
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,690
This is awful.

327
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:47,593
Helen writes 30% above
her quota every month.

328
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:50,329
Helen's electronic ticket
book was smashed to pieces.

329
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:51,531
Animals.

330
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:54,767
-Restroom?
-Yeah, it's in the back.

331
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:56,936
I'd like to see who she
wrote tickets for today...

332
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:59,138
...specifically the last ticket
she wrote before she was shot.

333
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:02,075
I'd also like names of people
she's written large numbers...

334
00:19:02,075 --> 00:19:04,010
...of tickets to over
the last year.

335
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,344
I'll print them out.

336
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:07,647
Hey...

337
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:12,552
...who can I talk to
about a parking snafu?

338
00:19:12,552 --> 00:19:18,291
-I got this $63 ticket.
-"No Parking 4:00 to 7:00."

339
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,793
Right. Yeah.
In front of the courthouse.

340
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:25,465
See, I was on the job. I was
testifying in a kiddie porn case.

341
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:30,303
We got the sick bastard, thank God.
But anyway, I got this ticket.

342
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:33,005
Aren't the police provided
parking off of Grand Avenue?

343
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,074
Yeah, but that's like
six blocks away.

344
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:39,245
I was running late for this,
child pornography case.

345
00:19:39,245 --> 00:19:41,914
Well, I guess you're gonna
have to challenge it in court.

346
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:46,652
Come on, a little help maybe.
One officer to another.

347
00:19:49,322 --> 00:19:51,424
I don't fix parking tickets, sir.

348
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:55,394
And being a police officer
doesn't place you above the law.

349
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:02,869
All set?

350
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:08,674
-This guy was quite the bookkeeper.
-Yeah?

351
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:10,176
What's he got in there?

352
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:13,412
Nothing about Armadillo,
but look at this.

353
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:17,650
He was making monthly payments to a
landlord when he owns the building.

354
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:21,954
Well, maybe Armadillo's the landlord.
Tio got tired of shelling out.

355
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:25,625
-Fire was the payback.
-Black dealer, Latino boss man?

356
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:29,328
I doubt it. Besides, he
was making payments weeks...

357
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:31,597
...before Armadillo crossed the
border.

358
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:36,769
Maybe this is the guy
Armadillo's trying to squeeze out.

359
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:38,905
-Your boys find Tio?
-Yeah.

360
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:41,641
-Well, good. Let's bring him in.
-It's not that easy.

361
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:43,442
Sure it is. Come on.

362
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:53,052
-I'll bring him out.
-I'll come with.

363
00:20:53,052 --> 00:20:55,788
He's my C.I. I just
bring a stranger in there,...

364
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:57,390
...it'll blow the trust.

365
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,858
You said you hadn't
seen him in months.

366
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:00,860
You don't know how squirrelly
this guy might be.

367
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,395
You're not going in
there without backup.

368
00:21:02,395 --> 00:21:05,231
Look. Tio's still valuable
to me, all right?

369
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:06,699
Now wait here.

370
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:08,701
I'll handle this.

371
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,604
Something I should know
about you and this guy?

372
00:21:12,205 --> 00:21:15,174
No. I'll be right out.

373
00:21:21,314 --> 00:21:23,916
If you come in voluntarily, it'll look
like you've got nothing to hide.

374
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,685
You gonna watch my back, right?

375
00:21:25,685 --> 00:21:28,754
Yeah. And you're gonna watch mine.
She wants Armadillo.

376
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:31,090
Thinks grillin'you about the
landlord will lead to him.

377
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,225
What do I tell her?

378
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:37,296
You're just another local shop owner
forced to pay protection money.

379
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,465
Choose your favorite
band of brothers.

380
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,767
One-niners, The Monks,
Jack-uzis, got it?

381
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:42,869
Yeah, I'm good.

382
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:45,738
Yeah, so is Wyms.
You be careful.

383
00:21:45,738 --> 00:21:47,506
I'm trying to lead her
down a different path.

384
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,345
Here's the guy you're gonna I.D.

385
00:21:54,547 --> 00:21:56,549
I'm pretty sure
he's the firebug.

386
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,918
Now, you tell us that
you saw him casing...

387
00:21:58,918 --> 00:22:00,853
...the building last night
before you left.

388
00:22:00,853 --> 00:22:03,623
No problem. What are we doing
about hitting Armadillo?

389
00:22:03,623 --> 00:22:05,758
We found out
where the Torrucos hang.

390
00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:09,195
Your little friends are gonna rip
a three-alarmer through it tonight.

391
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:11,597
Vic.

392
00:22:11,597 --> 00:22:13,733
-You get the plan?
-Yeah, I'm good.

393
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:19,839
Everything okay in here?

394
00:22:20,907 --> 00:22:23,776
Sure. Everything's fine.

395
00:22:29,683 --> 00:22:32,486
This is a list of your property.
I want you to take a look at it.

396
00:22:35,389 --> 00:22:37,658
That the bitch
that burned my place up?

397
00:22:37,658 --> 00:22:39,360
You're here to tell us
what you know.

398
00:22:41,529 --> 00:22:43,931
-Hey, Vic.
-I'm in the middle of something.

399
00:22:43,931 --> 00:22:46,500
-It's important.
-Give me a minute.

400
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,002
I'll start without you.

401
00:22:50,804 --> 00:22:51,805
What's up?

402
00:22:51,805 --> 00:22:54,808
My guy. Followed Corrine to
the Colorado Springs airport.

403
00:22:54,808 --> 00:22:56,944
Airport? Where's she going?

404
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,448
Come on.

405
00:23:01,782 --> 00:23:03,684
Where the hell is she going?

406
00:23:03,684 --> 00:23:06,687
-Who does she know in Phoenix?
-Phoenix?

407
00:23:06,687 --> 00:23:08,989
No clue. That's what
I'm paying you to find out.

408
00:23:08,989 --> 00:23:12,026
-And I'm trying, Vic.
-Are the kids with her?

409
00:23:12,026 --> 00:23:14,562
Just the baby. Cassidy and Matthew
are still with the friend.

410
00:23:14,562 --> 00:23:16,530
And I got another guy
waiting for her on that end.

411
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:17,765
Phoenix?

412
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,169
Look, I gotta go. Call me as
soon as you know something.

413
00:23:22,169 --> 00:23:23,304
All right. I will.

414
00:23:24,471 --> 00:23:26,974
-What did I miss?
-Tio found our guy.

415
00:23:26,974 --> 00:23:29,276
This is the dude. Couldn't
miss that inked baldhead.

416
00:23:29,276 --> 00:23:31,278
Saw him hangin' out
in the back lot when I was leavin'.

417
00:23:31,278 --> 00:23:34,081
Ripley Verdugo. Seven
priors, three for arson.

418
00:23:34,081 --> 00:23:35,516
Consider him picked up.

419
00:23:40,454 --> 00:23:41,855
You coming with?

420
00:23:41,855 --> 00:23:44,124
No, you go ahead and
pick up the suspect.

421
00:23:44,124 --> 00:23:46,260
I'm gonna have
a little talk with Tio.

422
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:56,136
Juice? Soda? A new distribution crib?

423
00:23:56,136 --> 00:23:58,639
-I'm here to help, lady.
-Good.

424
00:24:00,074 --> 00:24:02,176
Let's talk about
your record keeping.

425
00:24:03,077 --> 00:24:05,879
There are some pretty
interesting things in this ledger.

426
00:24:06,914 --> 00:24:09,383
I'll tell you what.
I've never seen Vic this pissed.

427
00:24:09,383 --> 00:24:12,319
He's pissed about his kids.
It's classic displacement, man.

428
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:14,655
It's classic replacement
I'm worried about.

429
00:24:14,655 --> 00:24:16,624
-Think he'll boot us?
-Gimme a break.

430
00:24:16,624 --> 00:24:19,026
-What would Vic be without us?
-Maybe we'll find out.

431
00:24:19,026 --> 00:24:21,228
I'm not going back to Traffic.

432
00:24:21,228 --> 00:24:23,631
Let's just do our jobs,
and do it well.

433
00:24:23,631 --> 00:24:25,699
So now that plan
makes sense to you?

434
00:24:25,699 --> 00:24:27,167
-Shut up.
-No, you shut up.

435
00:24:27,167 --> 00:24:28,168
Damn!

436
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:31,572
Put on a shirt, bitch.

437
00:24:44,051 --> 00:24:46,920
Racked up quite
the parking portfolio, Barney.

438
00:24:47,454 --> 00:24:50,257
Thirteen hundred and
eighty-six dollars.

439
00:24:50,257 --> 00:24:51,392
Yeah.

440
00:24:51,392 --> 00:24:55,262
I get a lot on the job.
I lose track.

441
00:24:55,262 --> 00:24:57,665
-What is your job?
-I'm a messenger.

442
00:24:58,999 --> 00:25:03,137
-I gotta pay for any tickets I get.
-You got another one today.

443
00:25:03,137 --> 00:25:05,205
Yeah. So?

444
00:25:05,205 --> 00:25:08,175
So the woman who wrote that ticket
was shot three times this morning.

445
00:25:08,742 --> 00:25:11,445
She's gonna live,
but not like she used to.

446
00:25:11,445 --> 00:25:12,646
I'm sorry to hear that.

447
00:25:12,646 --> 00:25:16,116
She wrote you 34 tickets
in the last seven months.

448
00:25:16,116 --> 00:25:17,885
Maybe you're a little
upset about that.

449
00:25:17,885 --> 00:25:19,219
Yeah.

450
00:25:19,219 --> 00:25:23,824
Yeah, I'm upset.
I don't have 1,300 bucks.

451
00:25:23,824 --> 00:25:26,560
And I could lose my job.

452
00:25:27,828 --> 00:25:29,463
But I didn't shoot her.

453
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:31,432
Where were you at 9:30?

454
00:25:32,933 --> 00:25:37,371
I was, in traffic
on my way to L.A.X.

455
00:25:37,371 --> 00:25:40,674
-You fired a gun today, Barney?
-Of course not.

456
00:25:40,674 --> 00:25:44,611
-You willing to take a G.S.R.?
-What is that?

457
00:25:44,611 --> 00:25:48,048
Gunshot Residue Test.
Standard government test.

458
00:25:48,048 --> 00:25:50,150
It detects whether you've
fired a gun recently.

459
00:25:51,018 --> 00:25:52,920
Yeah, sure. If it'll help.

460
00:25:54,888 --> 00:25:59,693
How does a novice comic book
merchant buy two buildings, cash?

461
00:25:59,693 --> 00:26:02,429
Man, I can barely
cover my mortgage.

462
00:26:02,429 --> 00:26:03,931
I'm smart with money.

463
00:26:05,065 --> 00:26:07,534
If you're smart, how come you're
making payments to a landlord...

464
00:26:07,534 --> 00:26:09,069
...when you don't have one?

465
00:26:10,003 --> 00:26:13,307
<i>Being a C.I.
</i>isn't a "get out of jail free" card.

466
00:26:13,307 --> 00:26:16,076
<i>We found scales
</i>and drug residue above your shop.

467
00:26:16,076 --> 00:26:20,848
<i>-I know you're dealing.
</i>-Reality check.

468
00:26:22,449 --> 00:26:24,785
My building getting smoked
makes me a victim.

469
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:27,287
I can get that stack
of cash in the safe...

470
00:26:27,287 --> 00:26:29,189
...and the dollar amounts
in this ledger...

471
00:26:29,189 --> 00:26:32,192
...and have search warrants
for your home and other building.

472
00:26:32,826 --> 00:26:35,596
What we find there
gonna make you a victim too?

473
00:26:37,765 --> 00:26:39,299
Can I help you somehow?

474
00:26:40,701 --> 00:26:45,439
<i>Help me get Armadillo, and
</i>I ignore this ledger.

475
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:48,408
That's Tio? He's the guy
the Long Beach sheriffs...

476
00:26:48,408 --> 00:26:49,910
...pulled over with your team.

477
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:50,978
Right.

478
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:56,116
-What else haven't you told me?
-Be quiet. I'm trying to listen.

479
00:26:57,117 --> 00:26:58,986
How deep is your
relationship with this guy?

480
00:26:58,986 --> 00:27:00,120
Deep enough.

481
00:27:05,292 --> 00:27:07,327
-Can he hurt us?
-He won't.

482
00:27:07,327 --> 00:27:09,363
-He can't or he won't?
-He won't.

483
00:27:09,363 --> 00:27:12,633
We had a deal. You said
you were gonna clean up your act.

484
00:27:14,301 --> 00:27:15,736
I'm in control.

485
00:27:16,703 --> 00:27:19,239
I've got a watchdog in my house,
and now one of my best detectives...

486
00:27:19,239 --> 00:27:21,575
...is grilling the guy who can
blow the whistle on you.

487
00:27:23,343 --> 00:27:26,046
Hey, how's she doing?

488
00:27:26,046 --> 00:27:27,781
Aren't you working a case?

489
00:27:28,482 --> 00:27:32,519
I got half an hour before
my next evil parking suspect shows up.

490
00:27:37,624 --> 00:27:38,926
We gotta stop this.

491
00:27:38,926 --> 00:27:41,461
Yeah, and we gotta be careful
the way we play Claudette.

492
00:27:41,461 --> 00:27:43,263
<i>Come on, greaseball.
</i>Let's go.

493
00:27:46,233 --> 00:27:47,401
Beauty.

494
00:27:54,441 --> 00:27:57,044
Firebug's here. Wanted to give
you the first crack at him.

495
00:27:57,044 --> 00:27:58,312
Thanks.

496
00:27:59,479 --> 00:28:01,315
Let Tio stew.

497
00:28:01,315 --> 00:28:03,016
I haven't finished with him yet.

498
00:28:03,717 --> 00:28:04,918
Sure.

499
00:28:07,554 --> 00:28:09,189
Look at my prayer mat.

500
00:28:09,189 --> 00:28:12,292
I hang it here to dry.
And she had her dog rip it to pieces.

501
00:28:12,292 --> 00:28:15,762
Anyone could have done that. If it's
so sacred, you shouldn't leave it out.

502
00:28:15,762 --> 00:28:18,332
Somebody needs to put
that animal to sleep.

503
00:28:18,332 --> 00:28:20,968
Is that what you're doing in there?
Cookin'up gas to put us all to sleep?

504
00:28:20,968 --> 00:28:22,569
That's enough!

505
00:28:23,704 --> 00:28:27,074
Look, you had us search his place,
and we did. He's not a terrorist.

506
00:28:27,074 --> 00:28:31,044
Go back inside and restrain that dog
before I call animal control.

507
00:28:31,044 --> 00:28:34,648
And you, stop egging her on.
Stop threatening her dog.

508
00:28:34,648 --> 00:28:36,750
And stop acting
like such a victim.

509
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:39,920
Both of you go inside
and stay inside your own apartments.

510
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,356
You do not want us
coming back here again.

511
00:28:51,798 --> 00:28:55,369
-You're learning.
-Good teacher.

512
00:28:57,871 --> 00:29:00,274
Wanna tell me where you were
last night, Ripley?

513
00:29:00,274 --> 00:29:01,608
I was home.

514
00:29:02,175 --> 00:29:06,446
Jerkin' off into a sock.
You wanna see the evidence?

515
00:29:06,446 --> 00:29:08,849
Have some manners
when you talk to me.

516
00:29:13,587 --> 00:29:15,856
How long since you
looked like that?

517
00:29:15,856 --> 00:29:19,860
The shaved head thing went out
like six months ago. Why?

518
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:23,063
-Jesus, I can't catch a goddamn break.
-What now?

519
00:29:23,063 --> 00:29:25,599
-Tio I.D.'d a bald guy.
-Vic!

520
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:26,867
Yeah?

521
00:29:26,867 --> 00:29:28,802
You care to tell me how
our eyewitness Tio...

522
00:29:28,802 --> 00:29:30,270
...identified a thug
from a year-old...

523
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:32,306
...police mug shot that
only you and I had?

524
00:29:32,306 --> 00:29:33,807
No clue, but I'm gonna
help you find out.

525
00:29:33,807 --> 00:29:37,311
It's okay. You've done enough.
I'll get to the bottom of this.

526
00:29:37,311 --> 00:29:40,480
You identified the right guy,
but the wrong hair.

527
00:29:41,148 --> 00:29:43,951
Wrong hair? That's weird.

528
00:29:43,951 --> 00:29:48,355
Now, you're gonna tell me why you lied
and who you're protecting, right now!

529
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:52,426
Tio will hold up.
He knows the drill.

530
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:56,196
You wanna put both our careers
in this guy's hands?

531
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,008
Why'd she do that?

532
00:30:12,547 --> 00:30:14,716
Who are you paying
protection money to?

533
00:30:14,716 --> 00:30:16,351
I saw who I saw.

534
00:30:22,523 --> 00:30:24,592
What's your
connection to Mackey?

535
00:30:27,128 --> 00:30:28,830
I'm just a C.I.

536
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:32,367
I tie that payout to a cop,
and I'll get you for racketeering.

537
00:30:32,367 --> 00:30:34,535
You hitch that to the intent
to distribute charge...

538
00:30:34,535 --> 00:30:37,739
...and you won't see your
baby girl until she's 35.

539
00:30:37,739 --> 00:30:40,975
-Now talk to me!
-Claudette, you got a second?

540
00:30:40,975 --> 00:30:42,777
-Now?
-Yes.

541
00:30:45,446 --> 00:30:47,582
A club on Juniper
just went up in flames.

542
00:30:47,582 --> 00:30:50,785
F.D. says it looks like the same
arson M.O. as the comic book store.

543
00:30:50,785 --> 00:30:52,987
-I want you down there.
-I'm in the middle of this.

544
00:30:53,721 --> 00:30:55,490
Questioning a
witness can wait.

545
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:58,459
He could be the key
to getting Armadillo.

546
00:30:58,459 --> 00:31:00,261
An hour ago it was
your mandate.

547
00:31:00,261 --> 00:31:02,163
Now you've got me
chasing fire engines?

548
00:31:03,731 --> 00:31:06,334
I have a civilian auditor
evaluating my every move.

549
00:31:06,334 --> 00:31:10,438
You're the primary detective on
this case. I need you on scene.

550
00:31:10,438 --> 00:31:13,107
-This isn't a discussion.
-What is it exactly?

551
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:20,481
The cop said this was about
that parking lady that was shot today?

552
00:31:20,481 --> 00:31:22,817
That's right, Izzy.
And the last ticket...

553
00:31:22,817 --> 00:31:24,852
...she wrote before that
happened was to you.

554
00:31:24,852 --> 00:31:26,654
Which means you're either
a witness or a suspect.

555
00:31:26,654 --> 00:31:29,991
-Take a seat.
-Well, I didn't see anything.

556
00:31:29,991 --> 00:31:32,827
-I guess that makes you a suspect.
-A suspect?

557
00:31:32,827 --> 00:31:35,263
Look, I take the tickets
'cause it's cheaper than the garage.

558
00:31:35,263 --> 00:31:36,497
Cheaper?

559
00:31:36,497 --> 00:31:40,034
The parking structure
is 22 bucks for the day.

560
00:31:40,034 --> 00:31:44,205
I usually get two,
maybe three $30 tickets a week.

561
00:31:44,639 --> 00:31:48,443
110 versus 90.
I'm saving 20 taking the fines.

562
00:31:48,443 --> 00:31:50,311
So you knew you were
gonna get the ticket?

563
00:31:50,311 --> 00:31:51,612
It's part of doing business.

564
00:31:51,612 --> 00:31:54,115
Are you willing to take
a Gunshot Residue Test?

565
00:31:54,115 --> 00:31:57,085
-Will it cost me anything?
-Only if you're lying.

566
00:32:03,091 --> 00:32:05,793
-Burn this. No more bookkeeping.
-Understood.

567
00:32:05,793 --> 00:32:07,695
You're out of here. Lay low.

568
00:32:09,864 --> 00:32:10,932
Yeah?

569
00:32:10,932 --> 00:32:13,301
Corrine caught a connecting
flight in Phoenix.

570
00:32:13,301 --> 00:32:14,902
She's due in Burbank
in 40 minutes.

571
00:32:14,902 --> 00:32:18,272
<i>-She's coming here? I should go...
</i>-Let me tail her.

572
00:32:18,272 --> 00:32:21,376
See what she's planning.
Be ready for my call.

573
00:32:21,376 --> 00:32:22,610
Okay.

574
00:32:29,384 --> 00:32:31,953
A high-level city official.

575
00:32:31,953 --> 00:32:34,722
I know. I'm sorry. I didn't have
a chance to return your call.

576
00:32:34,722 --> 00:32:38,926
Is there some reason you didn't want
me following Detective Mackey today?

577
00:32:40,061 --> 00:32:43,931
-Of course not.
-Excuse me.

578
00:32:45,066 --> 00:32:48,202
It was arson.
But it was Torruco base.

579
00:32:48,202 --> 00:32:51,706
-Someone trying to pay back Armadillo.
-That was fast.

580
00:32:51,706 --> 00:32:53,608
I'll see if Tio knows anything.

581
00:32:53,608 --> 00:32:56,110
-We cut him loose.
-What?

582
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:59,147
Didn't have enough to hold him. We
had to release him and his property.

583
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,183
-The ledger?
-Yes.

584
00:33:02,183 --> 00:33:03,484
What ledger?

585
00:33:09,023 --> 00:33:10,358
Nothing important.

586
00:33:14,896 --> 00:33:18,699
Three shots. The victim's book
was smashed to pieces.

587
00:33:18,699 --> 00:33:21,803
-This was a rage crime. Try this.
-Nope.

588
00:33:22,537 --> 00:33:24,839
Mr. Thrifty knew he was
getting the ticket.

589
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:28,843
-It's homemade. Try it.
-Yeah?

590
00:33:28,843 --> 00:33:30,611
Barney's just way too passive.

591
00:33:30,611 --> 00:33:33,614
Plus, they both willingly
agreed to a G.S.R.

592
00:33:33,614 --> 00:33:34,782
So what are you gonna do now?

593
00:33:34,782 --> 00:33:37,185
I'll take a look at other
crimes in the area this morning.

594
00:33:37,185 --> 00:33:38,486
Make sure somebody
wasn't trying...

595
00:33:38,486 --> 00:33:41,155
...to avoid being put at the wrong
place at the right time.

596
00:33:41,155 --> 00:33:44,725
G.S.R. results came back on
Barney Plotkin. Positive.

597
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:46,527
What?

598
00:33:46,527 --> 00:33:49,097
The "way too passive" guy?

599
00:33:49,097 --> 00:33:50,298
Let me see that.

600
00:33:56,804 --> 00:33:57,872
Look out.

601
00:34:04,412 --> 00:34:06,380
You failed the G.S.R., Barney.

602
00:34:08,282 --> 00:34:11,886
Really?
Can I take it again?

603
00:34:11,886 --> 00:34:17,158
No. In ten minutes, I'll have a
search warrant for your car and home.

604
00:34:17,158 --> 00:34:20,461
I'm gonna find the gun you used
to shoot Helen Zamorski.

605
00:34:26,701 --> 00:34:29,804
-It's three inches.
-Excuse me?

606
00:34:31,205 --> 00:34:33,174
My tire was in the red
three inches...

607
00:34:33,174 --> 00:34:34,842
...and she gave me a ticket.

608
00:34:37,645 --> 00:34:39,647
She finds me every time.

609
00:34:41,782 --> 00:34:44,352
I asked her nicely.
She just laughed.

610
00:34:55,363 --> 00:34:56,531
Barney.

611
00:34:58,099 --> 00:35:01,736
If you knew you shot her,
why did you agree to the residue test?

612
00:35:02,436 --> 00:35:05,239
Well, if I didn't take it,
I'd look guilty.

613
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:06,641
And...

614
00:35:06,641 --> 00:35:08,643
And you said it was a
government test...

615
00:35:08,643 --> 00:35:13,014
...so I figured,
how reliable could it be?

616
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:19,353
I just got off the phone with the D.A.
They cut a deal with Ripley.

617
00:35:19,353 --> 00:35:22,156
He confessed to the arson
and turned in two accomplices...

618
00:35:22,156 --> 00:35:24,158
...with the understanding that the
three of them will do time...

619
00:35:24,158 --> 00:35:25,927
...together at Terminal Island.

620
00:35:25,927 --> 00:35:27,929
This guy's taking over
the goddamn prisons,...

621
00:35:27,929 --> 00:35:29,564
...consolidating his
guys into one place.

622
00:35:29,564 --> 00:35:30,698
The D.A. never
should've signed that.

623
00:35:30,698 --> 00:35:33,267
And we can never charge
Armadillo with this crime.

624
00:35:33,267 --> 00:35:36,504
And since we've got
nothing on the rape, he walks.

625
00:35:37,705 --> 00:35:38,973
I'm afraid so.

626
00:35:38,973 --> 00:35:43,511
You send me on a bogus run.
You cut loose the only lead I have.

627
00:35:43,511 --> 00:35:45,880
And then you let this guy cut
a deal that buries my case.

628
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,416
-What the hell is going on?
-We want this as much as you do.

629
00:35:48,416 --> 00:35:50,051
We got three arsonists
off the streets.

630
00:35:50,051 --> 00:35:51,085
That's a pretty good day.

631
00:35:51,085 --> 00:35:53,688
Save the statistic crowing
for your civilian auditor.

632
00:35:53,688 --> 00:35:55,523
What happened here today
was bullshit!

633
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:59,594
I don't know exactly
what the puzzle looks like yet...

634
00:36:00,428 --> 00:36:03,798
...but the pieces I see
are pretty goddamn ugly.

635
00:36:05,666 --> 00:36:09,503
I have never interfered
with how you run your team...

636
00:36:11,572 --> 00:36:13,774
...or how you run for office.

637
00:36:13,774 --> 00:36:18,012
I get assigned a case.
I'm gonna find the truth.

638
00:36:18,512 --> 00:36:22,550
And if I have to go
through both of you... I'll get it.

639
00:36:29,156 --> 00:36:33,494
Dutch just got the meter maid shooter.
Is there a problem?

640
00:36:34,695 --> 00:36:36,430
Just a little misunderstanding.

641
00:36:36,931 --> 00:36:39,433
A difference of opinion.
Keeps us all honest.

642
00:36:48,576 --> 00:36:50,444
"Harboring a felon"?

643
00:36:51,312 --> 00:36:53,848
Come on. That's a stretch,
even for this precinct.

644
00:36:54,515 --> 00:36:56,917
-I'll be in touch.
-I know.

645
00:36:59,186 --> 00:37:01,088
I'd rather it didn't
cover my window.

646
00:37:01,088 --> 00:37:03,124
It wouldn't hurt you to
look out and be reminded...

647
00:37:03,124 --> 00:37:04,592
...of what country you're living in.

648
00:37:04,592 --> 00:37:06,794
I am reminded every time I
look at your ugly face.

649
00:37:06,794 --> 00:37:07,995
Hey, hey!

650
00:37:07,995 --> 00:37:12,099
-This is my window, my property.
-Move back to your cave, Osama.

651
00:37:12,099 --> 00:37:16,837
Why don't you go back to the jungle?
No job, raising fat, stupid children.

652
00:37:16,837 --> 00:37:18,272
That's it!

653
00:37:18,272 --> 00:37:20,474
-Sir, get back in the house.
-Back inside.

654
00:37:20,474 --> 00:37:23,944
Talk about my boys like that,
and I'll cut your tongue out!

655
00:37:23,944 --> 00:37:28,449
-Drop it!
-Don't you talk about my boys!

656
00:37:28,449 --> 00:37:30,551
You don't protect me.
Allah protect me.

657
00:37:30,551 --> 00:37:31,585
Put down the gun!

658
00:37:31,585 --> 00:37:33,688
-Drop the gun!
-I do nothing wrong.

659
00:37:33,688 --> 00:37:34,922
Drop the gun right now!

660
00:37:34,922 --> 00:37:37,925
I just don't want to be
bothered by her, him, or you.

661
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:48,069
Zayed. Zayed!

662
00:37:49,637 --> 00:37:50,871
Zayed!

663
00:37:52,907 --> 00:37:55,176
Where's your Allah now?

664
00:38:06,054 --> 00:38:09,224
-Sounds like a clean shoot.
-I didn't have a choice.

665
00:38:09,224 --> 00:38:11,626
C.I.I.D. will be here
to do follow up.

666
00:38:12,327 --> 00:38:15,930
Fatality involved. Mandatory
downtime for the next two days.

667
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:17,999
Just take it easy, okay?

668
00:38:17,999 --> 00:38:20,201
Call if you need anything.

669
00:38:20,201 --> 00:38:21,603
Okay.

670
00:38:28,843 --> 00:38:32,547
Everything seems
exceptionally calm.

671
00:38:33,348 --> 00:38:36,317
No one seems too concerned
about a dead Arab, I guess.

672
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,522
How bad would this
scene be for you...

673
00:38:40,522 --> 00:38:42,590
...if the other neighbor
were laying there dead?

674
00:38:43,491 --> 00:38:45,727
People are still looking
for a reason to riot.

675
00:38:46,895 --> 00:38:48,263
It would be very bad.

676
00:38:56,905 --> 00:39:00,508
Is there someone I can call
for you? No one at all?

677
00:39:05,213 --> 00:39:06,414
What do you mean disappeared?

678
00:39:06,414 --> 00:39:09,184
I mean they're bone gone.
Three of my best dealers.

679
00:39:09,184 --> 00:39:09,884
You called?

680
00:39:09,884 --> 00:39:11,953
Callin', pagin', two-wayin'
They ain't answerin', man.

681
00:39:11,953 --> 00:39:15,523
It's Armadillo. He's probably already
got tires around their goddamn necks.

682
00:39:15,523 --> 00:39:17,759
All right, relax. Round up the rest
of your guys. Get them to lay low.

683
00:39:17,759 --> 00:39:19,994
He's completely punking us, man.

684
00:39:20,829 --> 00:39:23,231
It's time to send his
"cholo-ing" ass south.

685
00:39:23,231 --> 00:39:25,166
Yeah, like six feet south.

686
00:39:25,166 --> 00:39:26,601
Hey, you relax too.

687
00:39:26,601 --> 00:39:29,537
Jesus Christ, am I the only
one thinking around here?

688
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,821
How did the arson go?

689
00:39:47,188 --> 00:39:48,990
All smoke and mirrors.

690
00:39:49,591 --> 00:39:50,892
Why so vague?

691
00:39:53,762 --> 00:39:55,864
-You don't wanna know.
-Sure, I do.

692
00:39:57,532 --> 00:39:59,467
You mean,
you don't wanna tell me.

693
00:40:00,769 --> 00:40:02,904
And you think
you can't read women.

694
00:40:09,878 --> 00:40:13,081
-You okay?
-Yeah, fine. Thanks. Why?

695
00:40:13,081 --> 00:40:14,716
Just... Nothing.

696
00:40:14,716 --> 00:40:16,351
It was great spending time with you.

697
00:40:16,351 --> 00:40:17,652
I hope I didn't make
too many mistakes.

698
00:40:17,652 --> 00:40:20,588
Not at all.
Thank you for all your time.

699
00:40:20,588 --> 00:40:23,191
If you wanna talk some more,
maybe we could grab a meal sometime.

700
00:40:24,859 --> 00:40:28,997
Dutch, hitting on me...
that is a mistake.

701
00:40:29,497 --> 00:40:33,301
No. I meant if you wanted
to ask some more questions...

702
00:40:33,968 --> 00:40:35,603
I've got a girlfriend.

703
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,208
Christ.

704
00:40:40,208 --> 00:40:42,110
She made a stop
at the county courthouse.

705
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:45,346
Made copies of the kids'
birth certificates, came here.

706
00:40:45,346 --> 00:40:49,150
-What, a P.I.?
-Yeah. A big one.

707
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:52,587
He played one season for the Rams.
Thinks he's Dick Butkus.

708
00:40:52,587 --> 00:40:54,289
Jesus.

709
00:40:59,761 --> 00:41:02,897
-God.
-Liman.

710
00:41:02,897 --> 00:41:05,233
-Morgal.
-This is a confidential matter.

711
00:41:05,233 --> 00:41:08,636
Yeah, a matter of betrayal.
She took his children away from him.

712
00:41:08,636 --> 00:41:10,738
He's been looking for them
for over a month.

713
00:41:10,738 --> 00:41:12,941
-Where are Cassidy and Matt?
-I'm not gonna do this.

714
00:41:12,941 --> 00:41:14,442
You don't have to answer him.

715
00:41:14,442 --> 00:41:15,743
Who the hell is this ape?

716
00:41:15,743 --> 00:41:18,446
Your children are where
you can't hurt them.

717
00:41:18,446 --> 00:41:20,682
Hur... What is he talking about?
Corrine.

718
00:41:20,682 --> 00:41:22,150
I'm sorry.
I don't know what else to do.

719
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:23,885
Let me do the talking, Corrine.

720
00:41:23,885 --> 00:41:26,187
Shut your mouth, you
big, fat-necked prick.

721
00:41:26,187 --> 00:41:27,889
One more step and she signs
a restraining order.

722
00:41:27,889 --> 00:41:28,723
Stop it.

723
00:41:28,723 --> 00:41:30,491
-Corrine!
-I'm scared for our kids.

724
00:41:30,491 --> 00:41:32,560
'Cause of what happened with Gilroy?
That was a one-time thing.

725
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,330
-Let's go.
-Don't do this, Corrine.

726
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:36,764
Sorry.

727
00:41:36,764 --> 00:41:38,566
Corrine, you're not gonna
at least talk to me?

728
00:41:38,566 --> 00:41:40,969
It's not just Gilroy. It's all of it.

729
00:41:40,969 --> 00:41:41,903
Get out of my way!

730
00:41:41,903 --> 00:41:43,805
This is exactly the kind of
behavior I'm talking about.

731
00:41:43,805 --> 00:41:45,773
-That's my daughter!
-No!

732
00:41:45,773 --> 00:41:47,041
Hey, no!

733
00:41:49,043 --> 00:41:52,213
-That's enough, Morgal.
-The I.A.D. investigations.

734
00:41:52,213 --> 00:41:55,383
The civil suits. The money
that mysteriously appears.

735
00:41:55,383 --> 00:41:57,118
You got a lot to answer for.

736
00:41:57,118 --> 00:42:01,089
You're investigating me?
Corrine. Corrine!

737
00:42:01,089 --> 00:42:03,391
-I don't know what else to do.
-Corrine!

738
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:04,592
Don't.

739
00:42:04,592 --> 00:42:06,861
We'll get them back. Vic!

740
00:42:10,732 --> 00:42:12,000
We'll get them back.

741
00:42:20,975 --> 00:42:23,845
-What?
<i>-Mackey! Mackey!</i>

742
00:42:23,845 --> 00:42:25,013
Tio?

743
00:43:20,535 --> 00:43:23,671
-I asked you to leave.
-This is my house.

744
00:43:23,671 --> 00:43:26,207
Unless you have a warrant,
you're breaking the law.

745
00:43:32,013 --> 00:43:33,181
One of these laws?

746
00:43:42,015 --> 00:43:43,958
I told you to leave!

747
00:43:44,884 --> 00:43:46,119
Vic!

748
00:43:47,988 --> 00:43:49,122
Vic!

749
00:43:49,182 --> 00:43:50,432
Get off me.

750
00:43:50,924 --> 00:43:53,126
You ready to go now?
Huh?

751
00:43:56,027 --> 00:43:57,595
Vic, Jesus!

752
00:44:04,702 --> 00:44:06,704
I don't have to leave.

753
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:23,721
You planning to leave?

754
00:44:23,721 --> 00:44:26,191
You'll just have to kill me.

755
00:44:28,628 --> 00:44:32,232
Tell me you're leaving. Say it!

756
00:44:36,589 --> 00:44:38,715
Hey, Vic! Come on.

757
00:44:40,095 --> 00:44:41,897
- Vic!
- I want to hear you say it.

758
00:44:42,431 --> 00:44:43,399
Say it!

759
00:44:43,399 --> 00:44:45,344
- Vic! Vic, that's it!
- Come on.

760
00:44:45,345 --> 00:44:47,051
Come on.
It's over.

761
00:44:47,602 --> 00:44:48,937
Vic!

762
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,312
- Enough. 
- Take it easy.

763
00:44:53,313 --> 00:44:54,376
Enough.
