00:00:00,734 --> 00:00:02,068
<i>Last season on The Shield:</i>

2
00:00:02,068 --> 00:00:03,503
Your turn to play bad cop?

3
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:05,505
Good cop and bad cop
left for the day.

4
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:07,006
I'm a different kinda cop.

5
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:09,442
You're the police!

6
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:10,777
What's your take
on Vic Mackey?

7
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:12,078
I don't judge other cops.

8
00:00:12,078 --> 00:00:15,115
Mackey's not a cop.
He's Al Capone with a badge.

9
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:17,250
You suggestin' Mackey's
working for a drug dealer?

10
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,252
I'm suggesting the drug
dealer's working for Mackey...

11
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:20,587
...and I want you to
help me prove it.

12
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:21,488
What are you gettting
out of this?

13
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:22,922
I just want a dirty
cop off the street.

14
00:00:22,922 --> 00:00:24,858
You wanna be mayor some day,...

15
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:27,060
...you better learn how to lie a hell
of a lot better than that.

16
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:36,703
Terry was gonna turn you in,
so Vic wanted him dead.

17
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,405
-Vic needed him dead.
-No!

18
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:42,275
We killed a cop.

19
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:44,210
Until now I've tolerated you.

20
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,012
Come near my men again...

21
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:47,747
I'm gonna lose patience.

22
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:49,015
I know what you did.

23
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:52,318
You're not gonna believe what just
went down between Aceveda and Mackey.

24
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:54,287
Anyone gets between those two...

25
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:57,157
...is just gonna end up with a hose
full of piss running down his leg.

26
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:58,725
After all the problems we had...

27
00:00:58,725 --> 00:00:59,826
...I thought the one thing that...

28
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:01,394
...I could count on was the fact
that you had a good heart.

29
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,363
-I'm not gay.
-Julien...

30
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:06,466
I push it down it goes away,
but it comes back stronger.

31
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:08,501
Why are you a better deal
for me than Rondell?

32
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:11,404
I don't use my own product.
Rondell does, more and more.

33
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,006
If I'm done fillin' out
the job application,...

34
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:14,974
...let's talk about how
much rent's gonna be.

35
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:16,843
50 grand lets you move in right away.

36
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:19,045
-Some leaked the 911 tapes.
-Shit.

37
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:20,346
We got a situation brewing.

38
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:26,286
Pack bags for you and the kids now.
You're not staying here.

39
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:27,387
What are you talking about?
This is our house.

40
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:28,555
It isn't safe.

41
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:30,156
-What are you mixed up in?
-Corrine...

42
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:33,226
This doesn't happen to other cops'
families. Tell me the truth.

43
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:35,728
What are you doing that's worth
making us go into hiding?

44
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:37,764
I went by the hotel.
Your family's gone, man.

45
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,699
Corrine! Cassidy!

46
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:41,668
<i>I know you'll wanna find us.</i>

47
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:45,438
<i>If you still have love for me,
you won't, you won't try.</i>

48
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:30,450
<i>No!</i>

49
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:10,356
I sent Corrine's picture to hotels
with weekly and monthly rates.

50
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,592
Night manager called
when he got the fax.

51
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:16,462
Said she checked in about a week ago
as a... Jan Murphy?

52
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:17,964
Which room?

53
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:21,734
She's not alone up there, Vic.

54
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:23,536
-I know. She's got my kids with her.
-No kids.

55
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:27,006
There's someone else.
Ran the plates.

56
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:30,577
Guy's name is Steven Linfield.
He owns a yoga studio.

57
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:32,545
She's probably takin'
classes with him.

58
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,848
When my gash of an ex-wife
ditched me, first thing she did...

59
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:37,517
...was got that ass real tight.

60
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:40,019
Manager said the guy's
been up there every night.

61
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:41,287
Which room?

62
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:44,357
It's 209. Vic, wait.

63
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:46,759
<i>Wait.</i>

64
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,397
<i>Vic, don't... don't do this.</i>

65
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,514
<i>What the...</i>

66
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:11,684
What do you want?
Who are you?

67
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:17,256
I'm s...

68
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,426
I don't know. I...

69
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,896
Manager confirmed two different
photos, swore it was her.

70
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:25,331
You've been on this
thing for a month.

71
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:26,733
You can't find three
kids and a housewife?

72
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:30,069
No money trail.
The kids haven't been in school.

73
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:32,171
She's not with friends
or relatives.

74
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:36,142
Look, if we don't expand
our search beyond So. Cal.

75
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:37,977
You know, maybe I should...

76
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:39,579
...check hospitals, accident
reports...

77
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:42,181
Look, they're alive.
Just find them.

78
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:47,020
Come on. Hurry up.

79
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:51,257
Fresh from Mexico.
Still has its cherry.

80
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:52,959
Crack the seal.

81
00:05:02,301 --> 00:05:05,138
Two shipments in a week.
That's not bad.

82
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:18,217
-We're pregnant.
-Beautiful.

83
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:23,489
<i>Wrap it up.
We'll follow you home.</i>

84
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:30,496
You know, when we
double up on shipments,...

85
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,298
...sooner or later
someone's gonna notice.

86
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:36,135
Hey, Vic put me in charge, all right?
It's working, okay?

87
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:41,207
So just roll with it.
Christ. Couple of salties.

88
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:43,476
-They're gonna roust 'em.
-What do we do if they find that coke?

89
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:44,744
That's 50 grand each, gone.

90
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:46,579
Three black guys with a
trunk full of cocaine...

91
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:48,381
...can't drive the
goddamn speed limit?

92
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:52,385
Great.

93
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:56,389
-I knew this was a mistake.
-Shut up. Let me think.

94
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:59,225
Hey, you're in charge.

95
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:00,860
Hey, we're in this together.

96
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:07,633
Hey, lookee here, Clark.

97
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:13,039
Don't shoot!

98
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,641
-Keep your hands where I can see 'em.
-I'm a brother cop.

99
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:18,711
It's all right.
It's cool. We're cops.

100
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:19,979
Here you go.

101
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:25,985
Look, you're not
gonna believe this,...

102
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:27,620
...but you just nailed
my informant.

103
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,590
We're on our way to a bust.
That's our coke.

104
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,292
-Who's in charge of the sting?
-Mackey's our team leader.

105
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:35,394
I'll give him a call
and get him down here.

106
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:37,663
-Who's your C.O.?
-Aceveda.

107
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:39,365
Yeah, well, I'm gonna call him too.

108
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:42,802
Sure, if you don't mind
waking up a captain.

109
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,471
I don't mind.

110
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:51,210
Burning necklaces
have been gaining popularity...

111
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,213
...in Central and South American
drug cartels.

112
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:57,650
Only a matter of time
before se mueve al Norte.

113
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,720
South Africa's A.N.C. also
used tire necklaces...

114
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,722
...to torture and kill impimpi.

115
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:05,158
-Impimpi?
-Police informants.

116
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:09,228
-And since when do you speak Spanish?
-I'm taking a class.

117
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,265
I work in Los Angeles.

118
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,933
Not knowing the language
was limiting me...

119
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,802
...from being the best
detective I could be.

120
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:29,148
Hiya. I'm Detective Vic Mackey.

121
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:31,751
-These your men?
-Depends.

122
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:32,985
What'd they do?

123
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,189
We pulled over these guys,
found some weapons...

124
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:38,424
...and a sizable amount of cocaine.

125
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:43,296
-These guys say it's for a buy-bust.
-That's right.

126
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,131
They were supposed to
meet me over in Farmington.

127
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,999
Nobody notified our department.

128
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:50,036
We're waiting on a Captain Aceveda
to clear things up.

129
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:52,572
It's not necessary. We're
late as it is. By the time...

130
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:56,275
Aceveda shows up...

131
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,885
What's going on?

132
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:09,255
We pulled over these men
with several kilos of cocaine.

133
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:10,790
I was gonna give you a heads-up.

134
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,058
They claim they're on
their way to a bust...

135
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:13,226
...you authorized in Farmington.

136
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,303
I didn't forward the C-90.
I take responsibility.

137
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:27,440
Apologize to your C.O. for me.
I guarantee it won't happen again.

138
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:33,512
Sure. Sorry to hold you guys up.

139
00:08:33,512 --> 00:08:35,681
No, no. You were right to call me.

140
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:38,084
Look, I'm sorry about...

141
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:44,023
-You're on your way to a bust, right?
-Yes, sir.

142
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,859
-Then go arrest someone.
-Yes, sir.

143
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:54,333
You and I need to talk...

144
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:56,202
...now.

145
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:19,025
Hey, thanks for cutting us some slack
on that little paperwork snafu.

146
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:22,295
You've been logging less hours.
Arrests are way down.

147
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:23,896
Bad guys must be hibernating.

148
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,932
-Is everything okay with you?
-Sure.

149
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:28,167
Because you're a lot of things,
but sloppy isn't one of them.

150
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:31,170
Why don't you just give me
a demerit and call it a night?

151
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,840
A civilian auditor's
been assigned to the barn.

152
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,541
She gets a whiff
of what I've been smelling lately...

153
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,510
...she's gonna slam a lid
on this whole place.

154
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,545
Well, that's your problem.

155
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:41,047
I don't think she'll
be as understanding...

156
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:45,184
...of your paperwork snafus as I am
which makes it our problem.

157
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:46,385
This drug business tonight...

158
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:48,955
Shane and the boys are out
making arrests as we speak.

159
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:52,859
You better find your game,
and you better find it quick.

160
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:54,894
I never lost it.

161
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,170
The two victims have been I.D.'d as
Pablo Fernando and Christopher Reyes.

162
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,105
Street names are
Bang Bang and Cuca.

163
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:09,142
We got two dead bangers,
two different gang affiliations.

164
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:10,877
A Los Mag and a Toro.

165
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:12,812
Both high-level lieutenants
in the drug racket.

166
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:15,481
You can understand why they'd
want to kill each other.

167
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:16,582
Who'd want to kill 'em both?

168
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:19,852
-Well, that's the mystery, isn't it?
-Keep an eye out for the tag.

169
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:21,721
Talk to your contacts.
Find out what's brewing.

170
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:24,190
Maybe it would help
to recreate the crime.

171
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,392
Dios mio! I'm burning!

172
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:34,500
Hey, hey, Smitty.
Get these two to the morgue A.S.A.P.

173
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:38,938
Just a reminder: Lanie
Kellis will begin...

174
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:41,174
...observing activities
today in the barn.

175
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:42,842
She's a civilian auditor.

176
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:46,279
I know, but there was a riot...
the whole Gilroy scandal.

177
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:48,548
You can't expect the city council
to do nothing.

178
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:56,022
Say hello to fall guy number one
and fall guy number two.

179
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:57,557
Hey, why are you
turning in Tio's stash?

180
00:10:57,557 --> 00:10:58,958
It's not Tio's coke.

181
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,861
-It's theirs.
-They had that much blow on 'em?

182
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:04,297
-I thought they were small-time.
-They were until tonight.

183
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:06,098
I see you've made some arrests.

184
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:07,667
-Yes, sir.
-Good.

185
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,069
Finish the paperwork, return
the coke to Property,...

186
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:11,637
...and move on to your next case.

187
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:12,972
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

188
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,909
That's a ton of weight.
Did he say who's running 'em?

189
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:19,278
-Alvarez.
-Well, we better go talk to him...

190
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:21,714
...find out why he's moving
from the minors to the majors.

191
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:25,418
Goddamn it. What now? Yeah?

192
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:28,588
Tio, I don't like being here.
What's the problem?

193
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:31,390
That.
He's puking up blood, man.

194
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,326
What the hell did you call us for?

195
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:35,595
Like I'm gonna call a bunch
of paramedics to my drug crib.

196
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:37,430
-Jesus Christ.
-What the hell's wrong with him?

197
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,332
I don't know, man.
He looks like he's gonna die.

198
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:40,600
Well, did he eat something?

199
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,002
He snuck a few lines
just to check the stuff out.

200
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:45,171
Snuck a few lines?
What did I say about that?

201
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:46,038
Is he allergic?

202
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,940
Man, he's going
into cardiac arrest.

203
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,142
Shit. Get me a towel.
Towel, towel!

204
00:11:55,615 --> 00:11:57,316
Shit.

205
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,889
Come on.

206
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:07,260
God, it's beating.
We gotta get him to a hospital quick.

207
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,061
Drop him off.
Don't answer any questions.

208
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,630
Just get the hell out of there.

209
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,999
-Move.
-Hurry up.

210
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:18,537
Jesus...
How much did he do?

211
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:20,740
Just a couple lines.
He's not allergic.

212
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,175
Was he mixing?
Maybe the coke's bad.

213
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:25,111
The coke is not bad.
It's fine.

214
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:26,846
Tio just needs to step
on it a little more.

215
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:28,247
You're so sure. Do a line.

216
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:30,917
Have the lab run a sample.
See if someone spiked it.

217
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:31,951
Yeah.

218
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:34,186
Who's gonna mess with my stash?

219
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:36,789
Somebody with enough product
to step in.

220
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,792
Asshole, 12:00.

221
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:47,233
Hey, Alvarez.

222
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:48,467
-You're out early.
-What do you want, man?

223
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:49,502
Tell me something.

224
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:51,671
How does a pissant
crack dealer like you...

225
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:54,140
...suddenly start carrying heavy
weights of high-grade coke?

226
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,676
-I'm clean, brother.
-We picked up a couple of your guys.

227
00:12:56,676 --> 00:12:59,545
Who gave you the coke?
Who's trying to push their way in?

228
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:01,914
I don't know what
you're talkin' about, man.

229
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:04,283
Let's see if a car ride
jogs your memory.

230
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:16,429
I guess you don't get to visit
One-niner territory that often...

231
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:18,331
you being natural enemies and all.

232
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,901
Hey, Mo!

233
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:25,838
Your sister's ass really taste as
sweet as Alvarez here says it does?

234
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:28,541
He wants to know what your mama's
putting in the corn muffins.

235
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,875
Excuse me?

236
00:13:32,712 --> 00:13:36,182
-You messing with Tio's coke shipment?
-What? No.

237
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:38,250
Who gave you the drugs?

238
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:43,923
You don't help me out, you're
gonna have to find another ride.

239
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:47,293
Hope those $ 100 pair of
Cortezes help him run faster.

240
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:50,429
-All right. The Quintero brothers.
-Never heard of'em.

241
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:53,699
Armadillo and Navaro.
They're from Tijuana.

242
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:56,102
They told me to get ready
to flood the streets with blow.

243
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,306
They think they can just come
into Farmington and take over?

244
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:03,109
-I guess so.
-Guessed wrong.

245
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,644
Hey, get me out of here, man.

246
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:08,114
Get out of the way!

247
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:13,052
Claudette? Your dead guys
may have been cooked up...

248
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:15,588
-...by a couple of Mexican nationals.
-You got some names?

249
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:18,657
One. Quintero.
They're brothers...

250
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:20,359
Navaro and Armadillo.

251
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,469
-See that guy with Vic?
-Yeah.

252
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:34,040
He's been in a few times lately.
Any idea who he is?

253
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,041
Nope.

254
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,143
He had to sign in at
the front desk, right?

255
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:40,212
-That's the policy.
-You wanna check the log?

256
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:42,915
Love to.

257
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:45,951
I'm part of a network
of private investigators.

258
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:48,521
For a fee, I can get
your wife's info out...

259
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:50,956
...to over 200 P.I.s
throughout the U.S.

260
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:51,991
How much?

261
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:55,694
For 20 grand,
I can get to half the agencies.

262
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:58,964
It's good coverage, but less bodies.
Things are gonna move slower.

263
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:00,900
How much to make things
move faster?

264
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,035
50 grand will cover
the entire network.

265
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:07,206
If she's anywhere in the free 52,
we'll find her fast.

266
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:08,741
-Do it.
-They don't get started...

267
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,077
...unless they have half
the fee up front.

268
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:14,613
I need 25K, like, now.

269
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:17,349
You'll have your money in an hour.

270
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,718
Who would have wanted
to kill your brother?

271
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:23,289
-You know who Cuca was?
-Drug lieutenant for the Toros.

272
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:28,360
He was killed along with his
counterpart from Los Mags.

273
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,497
-Were they doing business together?
-Don't know.

274
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:33,399
Your brother was
burned to death.

275
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,734
Is there anything you do
know that can help us?

276
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:38,637
-Nope.
-Mrs. Reyes?

277
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:48,414
Does the name Armadillo
or Navaro mean anything?

278
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:49,648
Armadillo?

279
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:51,784
Mayda doesn't know
anything about this.

280
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:52,885
None of us do.

281
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:55,855
Again...

282
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:00,993
I'm so sorry for your loss.

283
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:12,838
Hey, what's up?

284
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:16,375
I need to make an emergency withdrawal
from our retirement fund.

285
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:17,943
You got the key, right?

286
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:20,579
Vic, there's nothing in there.

287
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,016
-You gotta be joking me.
-No, we took it.

288
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,052
Me, Lemon and Ronnie,
we took it to invest.

289
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:28,454
Without telling me?

290
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:30,789
You put me in charge while
you were taking time off.

291
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,529
A quarter of that stash is mine.

292
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:39,131
And I'm in the process
of tripling it for you.

293
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:41,167
It was... It was
gonna be a surprise.

294
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:43,536
It is. A bad one.

295
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:45,037
Look, I've been giving this thing
a lot of thought.

296
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:47,973
Yeah? And what's your plan, exactly?

297
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:51,677
I've been stepping up shipments.
I've been overseeing distribution.

298
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,345
Distribution?

299
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:55,447
We're middlemen
keeping the peace,...

300
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:56,982
...not drug dealers.
What the hell are you doing?

301
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:59,852
I'm not doing anything
that we weren't doing before.

302
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,321
-I'm just bumping things up a level.
-Well, what level is that?

303
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:03,422
Prison?

304
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:10,329
All right.
Where's my investment now?

305
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:12,064
It's all tied up in the coke shipment.

306
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:15,067
That coke that had Tio's guy
bleeding from every orifice?

307
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:17,603
-We don't know that that was the coke.
-I need that money.

308
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:19,305
Yeah?
Well, we all do.

309
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:22,074
No, I need it now
to get back my kids.

310
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:24,810
-What are you talking about?
-They're gone, Shane!

311
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:28,347
Corrine took 'em and disappeared.

312
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:32,885
What? When?

313
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:37,289
-Five weeks ago. God.
-Jesus.

314
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:40,159
And I need 25 grand right now
to find them.

315
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:42,361
-Why didn't you tell me?
-You screwed me!

316
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:43,963
I didn't...
I didn't screw you.

317
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:46,131
I was just trying to
make things up to you.

318
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:47,533
Goddamn it!

319
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:49,168
I didn't know!

320
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:51,971
-I lose my family, and now this?
-I didn't know.

321
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:53,939
-What am I supposed to do now?
-If I'd known, I'd never...

322
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,011
What am I supposed to do?

323
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:11,790
Cuca's friends say
you were his girlfriend.

324
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:16,495
You left him for Armadillo?

325
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:17,763
No.

326
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:20,266
Jessica Hintel...

327
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:23,535
...senior at the Wedney
School for Girls.

328
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:26,338
Father's chiropractor
to the stars in Bel Air.

329
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:28,073
How does your father feel about you...

330
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:31,310
...trading down from
Westside cheerleader...

331
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:34,713
-...to barrio gang babe?
-That angel tattoo on your face...

332
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:37,883
He must love seeing that
in the family Christmas cards.

333
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:40,853
It's a dove.

334
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:53,132
Two weeks ago...

335
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,635
Cuca and I were
walking down Olympic.

336
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:02,975
Armadillo and a few of his guys
came up to us...

337
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:07,313
...and asked Cuca
if he had changed his mind...

338
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:10,082
...and Cuca said no.

339
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,052
Armadillo took me...

340
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:16,188
...away from Cuca...

341
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,858
...to his house.

342
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:24,263
He told me to take my clothes off.

343
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,236
When he'd finished with me...

344
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:39,078
...he held me down
while another one gave me this tattoo.

345
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:44,650
A dove...

346
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:48,587
...to remember him by, he said.

347
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:54,126
When I went back to Cuca...

348
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,429
...and he saw the tattoo...

349
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:01,033
...he called me puta.

350
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:07,873
He wouldn't touch me anymore.

351
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,115
Can you have my dad
pick me up, please?

352
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,392
God. I fell asleep.

353
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:28,193
Yeah.

354
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,833
What are you gonna tell your wife?

355
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,301
She's out of town.

356
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:39,304
This is, like, the
fifth time this month.

357
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:40,973
Is it?

358
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:45,010
We're not wrecking something
that's working, are we?

359
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:48,814
Nah. We won't let it
turn into a thing.

360
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:51,950
Good, 'cause
I don't mind a thing. I just...

361
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,954
I just don't want a thing.
You know what I mean?

362
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,757
Yeah, sure.

363
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:05,764
Hey.

364
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:12,671
I'll see you around.

365
00:21:14,173 --> 00:21:15,374
Sit down.

366
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:22,448
The coke's worthless. It's got
rosary pea mixed in it. It's poison.

367
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:24,416
-Well, he tested it.
-For coke.

368
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,919
Not if it was any good.
If this shit hit the street...

369
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:28,687
God knows how many bodies
we'd be picking up.

370
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:31,123
I'm telling you, man. That seal
was intact. These guys saw it.

371
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,559
-You messed with it beforehand.
-I'm a customs guy, for Chrissake.

372
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:35,727
I was making money
off this stuff too.

373
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:38,230
If somebody screwed with it,
it happened on the Mexican side.

374
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,432
Well, who handles things
on the Mexican side?

375
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:43,902
It's, Rosalina Imports in Tijuana.

376
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:46,505
It's a front for some
guy named Navaro.

377
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:48,707
Navaro Quintero?

378
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:51,310
Yeah, yeah. That's him.

379
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,812
Jesus Christ.
These guys are up my ass.

380
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,215
<i>Better come out here!</i>

381
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,586
I got the other P.I.s started on it.
You got the dough?

382
00:22:00,586 --> 00:22:02,621
Not yet.
There's a problem.

383
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:05,057
These guys only started
without the deposit as a favor to me.

384
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:07,826
You gotta front me.
You'll have the money soon.

385
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:10,729
-It doesn't work like that.
-You make it work.

386
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:12,264
Just keep 'em looking.

387
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:14,166
I don't have that
kind of cash on hand.

388
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,200
Gordie.

389
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:19,238
These are my kids, man.
Please.

390
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:24,510
I'll tell 'em the
money's coming tonight.

391
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:26,411
Thank you.

392
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:28,347
But this is my reputation, Vic.

393
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,883
You don't have that cash
in my hands by 10:00 tonight...

394
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:34,086
I'm pulling them off the case,
and I'm off it too.

395
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:48,166
Ditch your weapons. We're headed south
to get our money back from Navaro.

396
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,869
-What?
-Just do as I say... for once!

397
00:22:57,142 --> 00:22:58,944
Vic, we've been looking for you.

398
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:01,280
I'd like to introduce you
to Lanie Kellis.

399
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,917
-I'm a little busy right now.
-Miss Kellis is our civilian auditor.

400
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:06,985
There's some things I'd like
to talk to you about.

401
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:08,320
I gotta go.

402
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:12,758
Don't worry.
I'll handle this.

403
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:16,128
What the hell are you doing?

404
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:18,664
-I don't have time for this.
-Why? And where are you going?

405
00:23:18,664 --> 00:23:21,400
-Tijuana.
-Mexico? What for?

406
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,535
Someone's putting poisoned
coke out on our streets.

407
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:24,803
I'm gonna stop 'em.

408
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:26,738
Well, you don't have
jurisdiction across the border.

409
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:29,308
-Well, I'm taking the day off.
-I'm not authorizing it.

410
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:33,278
Well, if you want dozens of potential
voters keeling over dead...

411
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:35,948
...so be it,
but I'm taking the day off.

412
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:57,570
Hi. What's the nature
of your visit to Mexico?

413
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:58,904
Little bit of everything.

414
00:24:00,406 --> 00:24:02,908
Go ahead.
Welcome to Mexico.

415
00:24:23,362 --> 00:24:25,497
Okay, get out.
Go find some guns.

416
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:28,934
-They got gun stores?
-It's Tijuana. Use your imagination.

417
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:30,369
Got it.

418
00:24:31,704 --> 00:24:33,405
If we find him, we'll call you up.

419
00:24:34,273 --> 00:24:36,609
Where the hell is Calle Mar Campio?

420
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,812
Come on. Nice girls.
Come on. Come on.

421
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:42,848
Come in, inside, with girls, nice.
Nice ones. Come on.

422
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:45,017
-Come over here please.
-Let's go.

423
00:24:46,385 --> 00:24:48,153
Rosalina Imports.

424
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,888
It might as well read "dead end."

425
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:52,324
-Now what?
-Goddamn it!

426
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:54,727
Police.

427
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,428
Is everything okay?

428
00:24:57,396 --> 00:24:59,932
Yeah. We're just
looking for someone.

429
00:24:59,932 --> 00:25:02,334
We're police too, from L.A.

430
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,736
You should be more careful.

431
00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:05,771
This part of town isn't
so tourist-friendly.

432
00:25:05,771 --> 00:25:09,742
-A lot of muggings.
-Yeah. Kidnappings too.

433
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:11,977
A friend of mine's sister
got nabbed here two days ago.

434
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:16,081
I am sorry to hear that.
Did your friend file a report?

435
00:25:16,582 --> 00:25:19,118
We'd rather pay the ransom
and get her back.

436
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,654
We're looking for
a Navaro Quintero.

437
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:25,291
Navaro.
I'm not surprised.

438
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:28,360
He and his brother
are our biggest problem.

439
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:31,864
Your own government has
a federal warrant for Navaro.

440
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:33,766
But as long as he's on
our side of the border...

441
00:25:33,766 --> 00:25:35,534
Look, you know where
we can find him?

442
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:42,608
-Where are we goin'?
-To get your guns.

443
00:25:43,142 --> 00:25:44,443
Keep following.

444
00:25:45,344 --> 00:25:48,681
You know, this place could
be nothing but casinos...

445
00:25:48,681 --> 00:25:50,983
...and poontang,
and white-sand beaches.

446
00:25:50,983 --> 00:25:55,020
Instead, look at it. It's the
goddamn asshole of South America.

447
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,389
Mexico's in Central America.

448
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:00,959
Hey, man, where the hell
are these guns?

449
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:04,330
Right here.

450
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:07,766
Where is your money?

451
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:10,235
Yeah! Your money!

452
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:13,205
Come on.

453
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:17,009
This is bullshit.

454
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:19,545
Shit, man. Goddamn it.

455
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:24,049
Give it.

456
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:26,285
Come on! Give it!

457
00:26:28,354 --> 00:26:29,621
<i>Come on.</i>

458
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,794
Now get out.

459
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:38,530
Get out!

460
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:41,233
Get out!

461
00:26:42,735 --> 00:26:45,938
-Detective Wagonback?
-Wagenbach.

462
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:47,406
Sorry.

463
00:26:47,406 --> 00:26:50,309
Lanie Kellis, civilian auditor.

464
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:53,078
Right. Hi.

465
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:55,781
I understand that you were
the lead detective...

466
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:57,282
...in Assistant Chief Gilroy's case.

467
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,450
Yes, I was.

468
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,652
The hit-and-run or the
land fraud scheme?

469
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:02,287
Knee-deep in both.

470
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:05,991
Could I get a look
at your personal notes on that case?

471
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:07,393
His bail hearing's
coming in a few weeks,...

472
00:27:07,393 --> 00:27:08,761
...and I want to make sure...

473
00:27:08,761 --> 00:27:11,063
-...that nothing surprises us.
-I'm certainly the man...

474
00:27:11,897 --> 00:27:13,866
...to, get you that file.

475
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:19,238
I'll get it to you as soon as I can.

476
00:27:19,238 --> 00:27:21,907
-Thanks. I appreciate the help.
-Mayda.

477
00:27:21,907 --> 00:27:23,442
You forgot your notebook.

478
00:27:23,442 --> 00:27:26,245
-Thank you.
-Did you catch him?

479
00:27:26,245 --> 00:27:28,147
-Who?
-Armadillo.

480
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:29,782
He's the one who
killed my brother.

481
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:35,287
Armadillo,
he came to the house one day.

482
00:27:35,287 --> 00:27:38,557
He told Cuca
he could join him, or he could die.

483
00:27:38,557 --> 00:27:40,459
He said that with you in the room?

484
00:27:40,459 --> 00:27:43,061
He kept looking at me,
like he was trying to scare me...

485
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:45,230
...but I'm not afraid
of him like Topo is.

486
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,199
Hey, sweetie, how you doin'?

487
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:52,070
-Dutch.
-Be right back.

488
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:59,778
-What's she doing here?
-She came in on her own.

489
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:01,613
Where's the mother?
The brother?

490
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:03,782
You're interviewing a minor
without a guardian present.

491
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:05,984
She implicates Armadillo directly.

492
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:07,719
He made threats to Cuca
right in front of her.

493
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:09,455
What exactly are we supposed to do
with all that information?

494
00:28:09,455 --> 00:28:11,356
Put her in front of a grand jury,
arrest this guy.

495
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,559
If she can lead us
in the right direction, great.

496
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:14,960
But her family doesn't
want her to testify.

497
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,261
She wants to testify.

498
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:18,297
-And her family doesn't.
-So?

499
00:28:18,297 --> 00:28:21,066
So if you had kids,
you'd understand.

500
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,535
-Mayda?
-Yes?

501
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,370
Hey, come with me, baby.

502
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:28,407
I'm gonna take you home.

503
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:33,212
I lost my barrette.

504
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,347
I'll get you a new one.

505
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:40,953
-Is something wrong?
-No. I'm gonna take you home.

506
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,655
Are you going to arrest Armadillo?

507
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:47,092
We are gonna try.
You're a brave girl for helping us.

508
00:28:47,593 --> 00:28:48,827
I know.

509
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:57,236
Only two guys. You'd think he'd have
more firepower around him.

510
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:59,738
Probably thinks no one's
crazy enough to mess with him.

511
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:04,910
Great. We're after
the ugly one up high.

512
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:05,844
Give me a piece.

513
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:07,412
We had a little
problem with the guns.

514
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:10,382
-What kind of problem?
-Montezuma's revenge.

515
00:29:10,382 --> 00:29:12,618
Shit. They're leaving.
We gotta go.

516
00:29:12,618 --> 00:29:14,820
What? They're packin'!

517
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,322
-Boss, this is nuts, man.
-Ronnie, go get the car.

518
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:20,058
Shane, Lem, you take the two big guys.
Take their guns.

519
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:21,560
I'll take el feo.

520
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:26,231
Easy, easy.

521
00:29:30,736 --> 00:29:34,172
Hey, can you tell me where
the donkey shows are around here?

522
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:44,650
Up against the wall!

523
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:46,818
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

524
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:50,522
-He's here! Come on!
-Don't even think about it.

525
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,560
-Come on!
-Okay.

526
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:57,930
Go! Go! Go! Go!

527
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:00,999
-Here you go.
-You got my boy in here?

528
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,001
-Randall?
-Are you his mother?

529
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:05,637
-Yes. Why is he locked up?
-Buzz her in, John.

530
00:30:10,876 --> 00:30:12,811
-What did he do?
-A hardware store owner...

531
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,379
...caught him shoplifting
some spray paint.

532
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:15,447
No.

533
00:30:15,447 --> 00:30:17,149
He says he's seen
him and his friends...

534
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:18,617
...tagging other buildings
in the neighborhood.

535
00:30:20,085 --> 00:30:23,455
Is that true?
Did you steal?

536
00:30:23,956 --> 00:30:25,724
You vandalizing now?

537
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:30,762
We don't usually bring
them in this young,...

538
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:32,364
...but we couldn't get
ahold of you...

539
00:30:32,364 --> 00:30:34,800
...and this guy's pretty adamant
about pressing charges.

540
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,569
Look, I cut back on my hours,
so I could be home nights.

541
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:40,973
I am active in his school.
We go to church...

542
00:30:40,973 --> 00:30:42,774
...and still he does this.

543
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:44,710
What else can I do?

544
00:30:45,711 --> 00:30:47,379
Let me see if I can help.

545
00:30:52,718 --> 00:30:55,520
-She's pretty upset.
-She should be.

546
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,323
He's only ten, and already
he's racking and tagging.

547
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,325
Next, it'll be armed robbery.

548
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:02,194
Before you know it, we'll be
mopping him off a sidewalk.

549
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:04,196
The mother's doing the
best that she can.

550
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:06,231
I think I can make a difference here.

551
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:08,767
Julien, come on. You want me
to tell you how this story ends?

552
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:14,473
Okay, fine.
Knock yourself out.

553
00:31:14,473 --> 00:31:16,475
Who knows?
Maybe it could do some good.

554
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:28,320
I ain't payin'you nothin', ese.

555
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,256
-Really?
-You let me go right now...

556
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:33,725
I'll let you get back
across that border alive.

557
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:37,429
Toss me one of them.

558
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:45,203
This what your brother Armadillo
does to people who don't cooperate?

559
00:31:45,604 --> 00:31:47,305
You're not cooperating!

560
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:50,676
Douse him.

561
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:14,966
Last chance.

562
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:18,737
How much money are
we talking about, man?

563
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,240
Three-fifty, American.

564
00:32:24,376 --> 00:32:25,610
I can do that.

565
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:29,548
-Plus 50 for ruining my day.
-Come on, Vic. Don't push it.

566
00:32:29,548 --> 00:32:31,083
Shut the hell up!

567
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:44,896
Armadillo Quintero?

568
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:49,234
Yes?

569
00:32:50,235 --> 00:32:52,938
You're a hard man to find.
We'd like to talk to you.

570
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:56,742
What are you doing
in Los Angeles, Armando?

571
00:32:57,342 --> 00:33:00,278
You mind if I call you Armando?
I have a hard time...

572
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:02,414
...keeping a straight face when I hear
the name "Armadillo."

573
00:33:03,749 --> 00:33:06,651
I'm looking for
new opportunities.

574
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,487
Those opportunities include...

575
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:11,590
...moving the Toros and the Los Mags
out of the drug business?

576
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,859
It's a little early
in the interrogation...

577
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:16,094
...to be showing all your cards.

578
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:18,230
Where do you go now
when I say...

579
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:21,967
"I don't know who the Toros
or Los Mags are"?

580
00:33:21,967 --> 00:33:23,468
Our house, our rules.

581
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:26,338
This hasn't always
been your house.

582
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:27,973
This used to be Mexico.

583
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:32,811
And I've been reading
about your rules.

584
00:33:32,811 --> 00:33:34,679
Yes, we saw the law
books at your place.

585
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,681
You could only keep me
here for six hours...

586
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,316
...without charging me with a crime.

587
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:42,287
You're a prime suspect in the fire
murders of two men last night.

588
00:33:42,287 --> 00:33:45,557
-We can hold you for 24 hours.
-And I can provide many people...

589
00:33:45,557 --> 00:33:47,459
...who will be happy to say
I was with them...

590
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:50,962
...when this awful crime took place.

591
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:53,298
Six hours.

592
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:57,002
You're not here to fight
the Toros and the Los Mags.

593
00:33:57,002 --> 00:33:58,637
You're here to unite 'em.

594
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:02,941
One gang, one leader: you.

595
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:14,753
Uniting the Toros and the Los Mags?
Come on. Think about it.

596
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:16,288
They stop pissing
on each other...

597
00:34:16,288 --> 00:34:18,690
...and turn their guns on everyday
folks... it's not good.

598
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:21,693
-So how do we keep him here?
-The girlfriend won't testify.

599
00:34:21,693 --> 00:34:22,828
Mayda will.

600
00:34:22,828 --> 00:34:25,130
I'm not putting a 12-year-old
girl in the middle of this.

601
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:28,266
Not with him involved.
We'll find another way.

602
00:34:43,615 --> 00:34:44,916
Here, man.

603
00:34:49,154 --> 00:34:51,423
I have a bad feeling about this.

604
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:55,427
Keep it to yourself.
All right. No guns, no games.

605
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:05,470
Drop your guns on the ground!

606
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:06,838
<i>Okay.</i>

607
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,728
What are you doing?

608
00:35:32,264 --> 00:35:33,865
Jesus Christ!

609
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,468
Let's toss him!

610
00:35:49,414 --> 00:35:51,716
-Anybody hit?
-No, man.

611
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:54,386
<i>Holy shit.
I just leased this car!</i>

612
00:35:54,386 --> 00:35:55,820
What are we doin'?

613
00:35:58,423 --> 00:36:00,191
He's got a federal warrant.

614
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:02,994
If the feds want him,
I say we let him start doin' his time.

615
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,696
We can't make arrests in Mexico.

616
00:36:04,696 --> 00:36:06,531
Once we get him back home,
won't matter how he got there.

617
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:09,601
This is insane! His buddies are
out looking for us right now!

618
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:11,803
We got our money.
Let's just dump him and go.

619
00:36:11,803 --> 00:36:15,206
This prick was willing
to poison dozens of strangers.

620
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:17,575
If we leave him here, you think
he won't come lookin' for payback?

621
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:19,110
How we supposed to get
him across the border?

622
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,912
In the trunk.
Same as the money.

623
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:23,481
That's if we even make it to
the border! Look at the car!

624
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:24,649
How am I gonna pay for this?

625
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:26,384
He'll be kicking and
screaming the whole way.

626
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:29,955
There's 20 farmacias on every block.
We'll go and get a bottle of roofies.

627
00:36:29,955 --> 00:36:31,556
What, the date rape drug?

628
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:33,858
Don't pretend like you don't
know what they look like.

629
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:36,027
We're gettin' 'em.

630
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:40,166
Armando was an orphan,
lived on the streets.

631
00:36:40,166 --> 00:36:42,635
I spoke to a woman who
was a social worker years ago.

632
00:36:42,635 --> 00:36:45,404
On a hunch, she gave him
an I.Q. test at age 11.

633
00:36:45,404 --> 00:36:46,872
Score off the charts.

634
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:49,775
She managed to get him into a
school for gifted children.

635
00:36:49,775 --> 00:36:52,578
-He lasted a week and a half.
-Didn't fit in?

636
00:36:52,578 --> 00:36:54,613
He raped and beat his teacher.

637
00:36:54,613 --> 00:36:55,915
When he was 11?

638
00:36:55,915 --> 00:36:59,752
Two years in Sinaloa juvie,
back on the street after that.

639
00:36:59,752 --> 00:37:02,955
If he hasn't been caught since,
he's gotten a lot smarter.

640
00:37:03,522 --> 00:37:07,293
I'll call I.N.S., see if the rape's
a violation of his visa requirements.

641
00:37:14,533 --> 00:37:18,404
-Do you have that file for me?
-I'll get it to you soon.

642
00:37:19,538 --> 00:37:23,409
When I ask for something, I ask
politely because that's my nature.

643
00:37:23,409 --> 00:37:27,179
But when you make me ask a
second time, I lose my patience.

644
00:37:27,947 --> 00:37:31,984
This squad has been the epicenter
of police corruption...

645
00:37:31,984 --> 00:37:35,554
...civil lawsuits,
and most recently a riot.

646
00:37:36,222 --> 00:37:39,658
The people I work for want answers.
They expect me to get them.

647
00:37:41,293 --> 00:37:44,396
I have the power to recommend changes,
get people fired...

648
00:37:44,396 --> 00:37:47,132
...even shut down this entire building
if it's warranted.

649
00:37:47,132 --> 00:37:49,034
Do you understand
what I'm saying, Detective?

650
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:51,904
Yes, ma'am.

651
00:37:54,840 --> 00:38:00,079
Good. If you could
get me the Gilroy file...

652
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,448
-...I would really appreciate it.
-Sure.

653
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,384
Thank you.

654
00:38:26,305 --> 00:38:29,341
-Man.
-Shut up.

655
00:38:34,179 --> 00:38:37,316
How do we explain
400 grand in cash...

656
00:38:37,316 --> 00:38:39,885
...and a doped-out
drug lord in our trunk?

657
00:38:39,885 --> 00:38:42,454
Nobody breaks a sweat,
we won't have to.

658
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:46,158
<i>Come on, boy. Search.</i>

659
00:38:58,704 --> 00:39:00,539
<i>Any sign of Detective Mackey?</i>

660
00:39:01,106 --> 00:39:02,508
He's still in the field.

661
00:39:03,342 --> 00:39:04,677
"In the field."

662
00:39:05,811 --> 00:39:07,479
Is that code for "He
pretty much goes...

663
00:39:07,479 --> 00:39:09,815
...wherever he wants without
any supervision"?

664
00:39:15,187 --> 00:39:18,924
You're not after Mackey, are you?
You're after me.

665
00:39:18,924 --> 00:39:20,359
I'm not after anyone.

666
00:39:24,363 --> 00:39:27,333
-You have enemies on the city council.
-Who?

667
00:39:27,333 --> 00:39:29,935
They're not thrilled that you
parlayed a scandal and a riot...

668
00:39:29,935 --> 00:39:32,204
...into a 15-point lead
over Karen Mitchell.

669
00:39:32,204 --> 00:39:33,739
17-point lead.

670
00:39:33,739 --> 00:39:37,242
They take the heat.
They get bashed in the press.

671
00:39:37,776 --> 00:39:39,778
While you come out
looking like a reformer?

672
00:39:39,778 --> 00:39:42,548
-I'm gonna be a reformer.
-Not if you don't get elected.

673
00:39:42,548 --> 00:39:44,083
I have a 17-point lead.

674
00:39:44,083 --> 00:39:46,518
They're hoping I'll find
something that will change that.

675
00:39:47,653 --> 00:39:50,356
They know I'll be fair,
but they also know...

676
00:39:50,356 --> 00:39:52,758
...that if there's something to find,
I'll find it.

677
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,761
I'm glad you know.

678
00:39:57,896 --> 00:40:01,133
Randall. The owner
left it up to me.

679
00:40:01,133 --> 00:40:03,669
He won't press charges if I
vouch for you. Let's go.

680
00:40:07,606 --> 00:40:10,109
Okay, tell me why
I should let you go.

681
00:40:10,109 --> 00:40:11,577
I don't want to go to jail!

682
00:40:11,577 --> 00:40:14,113
-I don't believe you.
-Henry and I needed some cans.

683
00:40:14,113 --> 00:40:18,717
Henry? Henry who? Do I need to
arrest him too for coercion?

684
00:40:18,717 --> 00:40:21,854
-No. I won't do it again.
-Are you sure?

685
00:40:25,657 --> 00:40:28,394
Okay. I tell you what.

686
00:40:29,128 --> 00:40:34,299
I'm gonna give you this one.
But remember, I'm vouching.

687
00:40:34,299 --> 00:40:36,568
And if this happens again, you will
have to answer to your mother...

688
00:40:36,568 --> 00:40:38,670
...and you will
have to answer to me!

689
00:40:40,339 --> 00:40:42,508
-You got it?
-Yes, sir.

690
00:40:50,315 --> 00:40:51,750
Go sit over there a minute.

691
00:40:56,321 --> 00:40:59,858
-Is he gonna be okay?
-He'll think twice next time.

692
00:40:59,858 --> 00:41:02,027
Thank you.
I'm so worried about him.

693
00:41:02,027 --> 00:41:05,397
You are doing your best.
It's tough these days.

694
00:41:06,432 --> 00:41:08,267
What church do you take him to?

695
00:41:08,267 --> 00:41:11,069
-Faith Temple.
-I've heard good things about them.

696
00:41:11,069 --> 00:41:12,271
I go to Covenant.

697
00:41:12,271 --> 00:41:15,207
That's Reverend Cook.
Bad smoker, good man.

698
00:41:15,207 --> 00:41:16,575
Yeah, that's him.

699
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:22,581
So, you gonna be home tonight?

700
00:41:22,581 --> 00:41:24,183
I don't know. Why?

701
00:41:26,852 --> 00:41:30,489
Because I'm not allowed to ask someone
out on a date while I'm on duty and...

702
00:41:34,626 --> 00:41:37,996
Come by.
Maybe I'll be home.

703
00:41:54,279 --> 00:41:55,514
Here you go.

704
00:41:56,849 --> 00:41:57,950
Thanks.

705
00:42:19,505 --> 00:42:23,642
-What's so funny?
-Nothing.

706
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:26,745
It's been six hours.
You're free to go.

707
00:42:27,279 --> 00:42:30,148
I guess what I did
when I was 11...

708
00:42:30,816 --> 00:42:33,485
...doesn't stop me from
visiting your country.

709
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:41,660
-Okay, stop right there.
-Okay, work it.

710
00:42:42,427 --> 00:42:43,228
Come on, boy. Work it.

711
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:45,898
I.D.s, please, and can you
pop the trunk for me.

712
00:42:45,898 --> 00:42:49,735
Sure. Busy day
for you guys?

713
00:42:49,735 --> 00:42:51,203
Work it. Come on.

714
00:42:51,203 --> 00:42:54,106
-You boys are cops?
-Farmington Division, L.A.

715
00:42:54,106 --> 00:42:56,141
You guys have a rough
time on the other side?

716
00:42:56,775 --> 00:42:58,143
Bachelor party.

717
00:42:58,143 --> 00:42:59,611
Can barely remember
the last few days.

718
00:42:59,611 --> 00:43:01,146
Pop the trunk for me, please.

719
00:43:01,146 --> 00:43:04,950
Sure. The trunk latch is broke.

720
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:06,618
Sir, stay in the car, please.

721
00:43:07,052 --> 00:43:10,355
-I will take the keys.
-Sure.

722
00:43:12,424 --> 00:43:13,992
What happened back here?

723
00:43:19,998 --> 00:43:21,500
We were in Rosarita.

724
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:25,070
Madame Marie introduced us
to some of her friends.

725
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:27,172
Came out this morning,
and it looked like that.

726
00:43:27,172 --> 00:43:29,474
You boys are lucky
you got off with just a few stickers.

727
00:43:29,474 --> 00:43:32,210
Yeah. Hey, you need
some help back there?

728
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:33,445
You're gonna need to
get rid of that wire.

729
00:43:33,445 --> 00:43:35,080
I think I got some pliers
in here somewhere.

730
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,381
No, that's all right.

731
00:43:37,883 --> 00:43:39,551
You guys have anything to declare?

732
00:43:41,086 --> 00:43:43,288
Just that it's great
to be back in the States.

733
00:43:43,288 --> 00:43:44,323
Welcome home.

734
00:43:58,237 --> 00:44:00,439
-Get in there.
-Give me the Polaroid.

735
00:44:03,375 --> 00:44:04,710
Quesadilla!

736
00:44:06,812 --> 00:44:09,582
Just wanted to give your little
brother something to remember you by.

737
00:44:15,588 --> 00:44:17,656
-It was creepy.
-How?

738
00:44:18,224 --> 00:44:21,594
The way he laughed to himself,
like something happened.

739
00:44:22,128 --> 00:44:24,263
He was sitting alone for an hour.
What could have happened?

740
00:44:24,263 --> 00:44:27,199
-I don't know.
-Maybe he's just creepy.

741
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:29,268
No, he was reacting
to something.

742
00:44:31,337 --> 00:44:33,706
-Ms. Kellis.
-Detective Mackey.

743
00:44:33,706 --> 00:44:36,742
I'm really sorry about
hustling out on you earlier.

744
00:44:36,742 --> 00:44:38,377
It did seem very abrupt.

745
00:44:38,377 --> 00:44:41,413
Well, we had a tip about a
Mexican drug lord being in town.

746
00:44:41,413 --> 00:44:43,449
Anyway, we just brought him in.

747
00:44:43,449 --> 00:44:46,218
Got him just as he was about
to head back across the border.

748
00:44:46,218 --> 00:44:49,488
Wanted by the feds on about 15
different counts. Pretty bad guy.

749
00:44:49,488 --> 00:44:53,559
But I just wanted to sit with you
and answer a few of your questions.

750
00:44:53,559 --> 00:44:57,363
It can wait until tomorrow.
Congratulations on the arrest.

751
00:44:57,363 --> 00:45:01,000
-It's a team thing.
-So, we'll talk tomorrow.

752
00:45:01,433 --> 00:45:03,068
I look forward to it,
Ms. Kellis.

753
00:45:03,068 --> 00:45:05,271
Me too. And call me Lanie.

754
00:45:13,579 --> 00:45:15,347
Unbelievable.

755
00:45:16,482 --> 00:45:19,285
-Did anyone talk to him?
-Who?

756
00:45:19,852 --> 00:45:22,488
Armadillo, when
he was in interrogation.

757
00:45:22,488 --> 00:45:25,491
-Nobody was supposed to.
-You check the tapes?

758
00:45:33,265 --> 00:45:34,400
What was that?

759
00:45:44,877 --> 00:45:46,178
What is that?

760
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:49,648
It's Mayda's barrette.

761
00:45:51,784 --> 00:45:53,419
God. He knows.

762
00:45:55,788 --> 00:45:58,290
Tio found someone with
an emergency supply.

763
00:45:58,290 --> 00:45:59,992
Enough to get him by till
the next shipment comes in.

764
00:45:59,992 --> 00:46:02,561
-Give me the leftover cash.
-Here you go.

765
00:46:06,265 --> 00:46:08,100
You know, even after
writing off the car,...

766
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:09,668
...we still come out
ahead on this deal.

767
00:46:09,668 --> 00:46:13,072
Asking for 50 grand
for ruining your day was sweet, man.

768
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:31,257
-Give me your keys.
-What?

769
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:34,126
I can't trust you with them anymore,
so give 'em to me.

770
00:46:39,198 --> 00:46:40,232
Come on.

771
00:46:42,868 --> 00:46:44,003
Here you go.

772
00:46:54,213 --> 00:46:56,482
-Where's Mayda?
-A friend's house. Why?

773
00:46:56,482 --> 00:46:57,750
Call and check.

774
00:46:59,852 --> 00:47:02,021
-Mayda came to talk to us.
-What?

775
00:47:02,021 --> 00:47:04,957
-She told us about Armadillo.
-No. I told her not to!

776
00:47:04,957 --> 00:47:07,760
We think he knows she spoke to us.

777
00:47:09,728 --> 00:47:10,529
She never what?

778
00:47:10,529 --> 00:47:12,898
She never showed up.
I'll make the call.

779
00:47:12,898 --> 00:47:14,500
Where is she?

780
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,769
-He's gonna kill her!
-We'll find her.

781
00:47:25,544 --> 00:47:29,348
Hey. You okay?

782
00:47:46,532 --> 00:47:49,335
-Mayda...
-No!

783
00:47:51,704 --> 00:47:55,974
-I'm here. It's okay.
-Topo, let us get her to a doctor!

784
00:47:55,974 --> 00:47:57,076
Stop!

785
00:47:58,377 --> 00:48:00,412
-Stay away from us!
-Stop!

786
00:48:05,784 --> 00:48:08,554
Topo! Please!

787
00:48:08,554 --> 00:48:10,222
Let us help her!

788
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:12,891
Topo, let us help her!

789
00:48:19,965 --> 00:48:23,202
My guy in Denver got a hit
on Corrine's driver's license.

790
00:48:23,202 --> 00:48:26,004
She got a warning
for rolling a stop sign last week.

791
00:48:26,004 --> 00:48:28,674
-In Denver?
-Colorado Springs.

792
00:48:28,674 --> 00:48:31,110
He tracked the license plate,
the address she gave.

793
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:32,444
Long story short...

794
00:48:33,278 --> 00:48:36,682
...he took this photo
about three hours ago.

795
00:48:39,351 --> 00:48:40,853
That's them, isn't it?

796
00:48:43,422 --> 00:48:44,957
Yeah, that's them.

797
00:48:45,457 --> 00:48:47,126
My guy lost 'em in traffic...

798
00:48:47,126 --> 00:48:49,762
...but if they're shopping
for groceries there,...

799
00:48:49,762 --> 00:48:51,397
...they gotta be close by.

800
00:48:51,997 --> 00:48:53,665
We're gonna get 'em, Vic.

801
00:48:54,933 --> 00:48:57,336
-Can I keep this?
-Yeah, sure.

802
00:48:58,070 --> 00:48:59,238
I'll call you in a few.

803
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:40,679
Hey. I didn't know
you made house calls.

804
00:49:45,918 --> 00:49:49,054
This P.I. you've been meeting with,
has he found them?

805
00:49:50,055 --> 00:49:53,692
-Found who?
-Your family.

806
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:56,595
I assume if they were
here, your place...

807
00:49:56,595 --> 00:49:58,263
...would be in a slightly
better condition.

808
00:50:00,098 --> 00:50:02,501
At least now I know
what's been making you so sloppy.

809
00:50:08,307 --> 00:50:10,943
By this time next year,
I'm gonna be on the city council.

810
00:50:11,944 --> 00:50:14,112
In six years,
I'm gonna be mayor.

811
00:50:14,112 --> 00:50:16,548
By then, I'll have
much bigger problems than you.

812
00:50:16,982 --> 00:50:18,984
In the meantime,
how do we solve this problem?

813
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:22,688
-I don't see a problem.
-I do.

814
00:50:22,688 --> 00:50:24,690
Her name's Lanie Kellis.

815
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:27,559
And as much as I'd love
to see her take you down,...

816
00:50:27,559 --> 00:50:29,461
...I don't need a scandal right now.

817
00:50:30,596 --> 00:50:33,098
So you and I need
to come to an understanding.

818
00:50:33,098 --> 00:50:36,835
You and me? Right.

819
00:50:39,304 --> 00:50:41,206
I don't see how
you have much choice.

820
00:50:45,177 --> 00:50:47,613
You don't want her and me
gunning for you, right?

821
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:50,015
You're smart enough
to know that.

822
00:50:58,724 --> 00:51:02,160
-You're gonna watch my back.
-Until the election.

823
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,829
In exchange for what?

824
00:51:04,396 --> 00:51:06,365
You get your head
back in the game.

825
00:51:06,365 --> 00:51:10,602
Get your boys under control,
and don't do anything to embarrass me.

826
00:51:13,572 --> 00:51:17,042
How do I know I can trust you?

827
00:51:20,379 --> 00:51:21,980
I guess we have a deal.

828
00:51:24,483 --> 00:51:25,651
Fine.

829
00:51:33,392 --> 00:51:38,196
This doesn't mean I like you.
Try to screw me on this...

830
00:51:38,196 --> 00:51:39,631
I'll bury you.
