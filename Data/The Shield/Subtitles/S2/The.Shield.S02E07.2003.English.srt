1
00:00:00,834 --> 00:00:02,101
<i>Previously on The Shield.</i>

2
00:00:02,101 --> 00:00:03,603
Goddam it!

3
00:00:03,603 --> 00:00:07,474
Tell me right now where is she?

4
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:08,975
I don't know!

5
00:00:08,975 --> 00:00:12,245
Maybe Bob's not
a sadomasochistic thrill killer.

6
00:00:12,245 --> 00:00:15,215
She's dead. She's in the
trunk the whole time?

7
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:16,916
Marcy, why didn't you tell me?

8
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,952
Sorry, daddy.

9
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:21,354
It's a battered woman's shelter.

10
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,756
I'm Emma Prince, director
of this shelter. Let me in.

11
00:00:23,756 --> 00:00:25,425
I got two more women
coming in tomorrow.

12
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:27,060
I can't send them back
to their abusers.

13
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,394
Where am I supposed to take them?

14
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:31,598
- What's this?
- Donation.

15
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:36,269
I'm not gay.

16
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:37,537
Julien...

17
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:38,738
I'm getting married.

18
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:40,807
- Married? To who?
- Vanessa.

19
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:43,743
- My God. You haven't told her yet?
- It's not necessary.

20
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:45,778
If you don't
tell her before the wedding, I will.

21
00:00:45,778 --> 00:00:47,413
So when am I getting out of here?

22
00:00:47,413 --> 00:00:49,582
Two years is the
best I can get for you.

23
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:52,318
How much time are you getting
for sexual misconduct?

24
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:53,453
Pardon me?

25
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:56,489
I got a yammy
full of Georgia joy juice, darling...

26
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:58,591
So, am I walking out of here...

27
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:01,628
...or do we need to
call your supervisor?

28
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:03,429
You ever heard a rumor
about a money train?

29
00:01:03,429 --> 00:01:04,964
<i>Supposedly runs out of L.A.
</i>every couple of months...

30
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:06,799
<i>...to clean their
</i>dirty money overseas.

31
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,002
So we're going to take down
a money-laundering ring? Sweet.

32
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:11,871
One big hit. In and out.
We're set for good.

33
00:01:13,172 --> 00:01:15,675
When were you planning on telling me
about Armadillo's death threat?

34
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:18,278
Cops get greenlit all the time.
It's just talk.

35
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:20,213
If there's one guy who'd be
the exception, it's him.

36
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:22,148
I never meant to get
you guys on a hit list.

37
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:23,583
We're a team, right?

38
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:25,985
We'll find him before
he gets to any of us.

39
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:47,840
Bang! You're dead.

40
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:51,711
Now, on the day, there'll be two guys
with Glocks at 11:00.

41
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:53,379
<i>Damn, I thought you said it was 9:00.</i>

42
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:54,914
That's why we're rehearsing.

43
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:59,919
<i>Mind getting that thing off of me?
</i>Gives me the creeps.

44
00:02:01,754 --> 00:02:03,656
<i>There'll be no one inside that bay.</i>

45
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:07,160
<i>Vans will pull in there.
</i>We'll be waitin'for 'em.

46
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,662
- Secrecy over muscle.
- Yes.

47
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:13,933
So how much dirty money
is this thing going to be carrying?

48
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:16,135
Enough for the four of us
to retire.

49
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:18,304
Sorry I'm late.

50
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,974
This job depends on the four
of us having our act together.

51
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,810
- Where the hell were you?
- I've been driving around in circles.

52
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,346
I thought I was being followed
by some Mexican.

53
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:28,715
- One of Armadillos's boys?
- I don't know.

54
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:33,186
Maybe. Maybe it's just
some pizza delivery guy.

55
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:35,922
Stalked by a cheese and sausage.

56
00:02:36,889 --> 00:02:39,926
- This greenlight thing is serious.
- You been gettin' enough sleep?

57
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:41,794
Yes, just being cautious.

58
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:48,101
Okay, good. All of us should be
extra careful till we find this prick.

59
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:50,837
Now that paranoia boy's here, you
going to run through this thing again?

60
00:02:51,537 --> 00:02:54,874
- Till we get it right.
- All right. Let's do it.

61
00:02:55,274 --> 00:02:57,276
Marcy Lindhoff agreed to a plea.

62
00:02:58,077 --> 00:02:59,412
How much time's she getting?

63
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:02,982
Eight years, in exchange for testimony
against her husband.

64
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:06,319
Eight years? The D.A. agreed to that?

65
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,222
To avoid shining the light
on our screwup, yes.

66
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:11,791
We had the victim alive
in a car trunk...

67
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,359
...in our own parking
lot for hours...

68
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,662
...until you released
the main suspects...

69
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:17,263
...at which point she died.

70
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,303
The D.A. arranged for you
to take Marcy's statement.

71
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:27,740
Confirm the facts she gave him
jive with your investigation.

72
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:33,112
Dutch, the chief
called me personally.

73
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:36,416
He's not pleased,
and to be honest...

74
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,484
I'm concerned about
your performance as well.

75
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:42,221
I'm going through a rough patch.

76
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:43,623
It happens to everybody.

77
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:46,225
Claudette says you're
moody, distracted.

78
00:03:46,225 --> 00:03:47,460
She said that?

79
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:51,798
You need to start closing cases...

80
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:54,000
...and closing them without incident.

81
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:56,869
Okay.

82
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,412
<i>Detective! It's Doug
</i>from the front desk.

83
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:09,716
<i>Detective!</i>

84
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:12,985
Detective, that couple's at it again.

85
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:16,489
Aren't you going to do something?

86
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:20,526
Goddamn it.

87
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,462
You want me to back you up?

88
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:24,964
I've only done this
about 3,000 times.

89
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:28,000
Okay, if you need me, I'm here.

90
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:34,173
- Yes?
- I live across the street.

91
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:35,808
I'm here about the noise.

92
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:38,044
I'm sorry.
I had the TV set up too loud.

93
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:41,180
Let me in. I want to talk to the
jackass who's beatin' on you.

94
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,683
- I'm fine, really.
- Is he still here?

95
00:04:44,283 --> 00:04:45,451
No.

96
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:47,987
It was just an argument.

97
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,462
- I see he talks with his hands.
- I didn't call the police.

98
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:59,699
Yes, you did,
through my closed windows.

99
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,634
- Look, it won't happen...
- I can't lay in bed and listen...

100
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,302
...to him doing it to you, okay?

101
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:04,704
- So you're either
going to move...

102
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:06,205
- ...or get some help.
- We can't afford to move!

103
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:07,740
I don't need any help!

104
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:15,081
If you're not going to move, then
you're going to get some help.

105
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,048
Let's go.

106
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:25,358
- You going to be okay?
- Yes, I'm perfect.

107
00:05:32,064 --> 00:05:33,900
Congratulations on your plea.

108
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:37,503
- Thank you.
- The plea's bullshit, Marcy.

109
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,672
You deserve life just like Bob.

110
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,874
No, I mean, thank you.

111
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:45,411
I guess the D.A. didn't
want this to go public.

112
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:50,683
You need to be 100% open
and honest with me,...

113
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,718
...or you lose your
deal, understood?

114
00:05:52,718 --> 00:05:54,287
Yes.

115
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:56,455
The peephole... Who
put it in and why?

116
00:05:56,455 --> 00:06:00,760
That was Bob. He liked how Kayla
looked. He wanted to see more.

117
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,061
You were okay with this?

118
00:06:02,461 --> 00:06:05,064
Bob liked bringing other
women into our bed.

119
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:07,166
I wanted him to be happy.

120
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,269
Did Bob want to bring Kayla
into your bed?

121
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:13,973
He asked me to talk to her.
I did. She wasn't interested.

122
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:16,776
So you lured her over
to your apartment one night?

123
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:19,512
Bob was obsessed.

124
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:22,248
He thought she was so pretty.

125
00:06:23,115 --> 00:06:25,785
Bob said it was your idea
to cut off Kayla's arm.

126
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,188
Yes.

127
00:06:30,756 --> 00:06:33,860
After that, she,
she wasn't so pretty.

128
00:06:40,499 --> 00:06:41,634
<i>Okay.</i>

129
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:45,605
Me and Shane are going to clear the
roof. Ronnie, you disarm this guy.

130
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:48,908
Lem, you hit the ground,
grab the truck.

131
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,477
- Hit 'em fast and leave 'em reelin'
- It can work.

132
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:55,381
Why are we even talking about this
when Armadillo's got a hit out on us?

133
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:58,351
We got feelers out on the street.
We get a call, we'll grab him.

134
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,419
And when we do,
Vic and me got a plan.

135
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,121
We're going to
tie him up,...

136
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:04,123
...stick him someplace safe
till we hit the money train.

137
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:06,726
Then we're going to leave him dead
in the getaway truck.

138
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:09,228
The Armenians and cops will think
the Torrucos are responsible.

139
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:11,764
- Two birds with one stone.
- Only one problem.

140
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,799
Besides the fact we don't
know where Armadillo is?

141
00:07:13,799 --> 00:07:15,701
Stop being such a pxxxy.

142
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:17,570
Excuse me for wanting
to stay alive.

143
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:19,872
Then let's stick to the job at hand.

144
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,575
What are we going to do
with the money?

145
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,944
It's too much to spend right
away without drawing attention.

146
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,078
We launder it.

147
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:27,480
Got a friend who just
bought into a restaurant.

148
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,614
Practically an all-cash business.

149
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,783
That's what I.A.D. is
going to look into.

150
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:32,718
We can't do this alone.

151
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,788
You're sayin' let someone else in?

152
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,423
Someone we can
control,...

153
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,926
...who's going to be more afraid
of us than going to prison.

154
00:07:41,827 --> 00:07:43,629
You used to know a guy named Tio?

155
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,768
- Why are we not in a police station?
- Theodore Osmond, drug dealer.

156
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:51,537
Guy you helped to buy
a comic book shop in another building.

157
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:56,509
Tio, sure. I heard somebody,
burned him to death.

158
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:59,111
- That's terrible.
- So you did sell him the store?

159
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:01,847
I brokered that deal.
I'm a licensed realtor.

160
00:08:01,847 --> 00:08:03,115
- Then you know Tio
sold narcotics...

161
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:04,917
- ...out of that store.
- No.

162
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:07,787
He bought the place cash. Where'd
you think he got his money from?

163
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:10,122
I don't ask my clients
where they get their money.

164
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:12,758
Is that because most of your clients
are drug dealers?

165
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:15,361
I think you specialize
in buying property for drug dealers...

166
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:17,496
...so they can launder money.
Isn't that right?

167
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:20,900
This is ridiculous.

168
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,601
Checked your files, Leith.

169
00:08:22,601 --> 00:08:24,904
Tied you to four major dealers.

170
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,373
How'd you like to see
our police station now?

171
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,344
I don't touch any of that.

172
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,212
I just buy and sell property.

173
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:35,214
The only property you're
going to be sellin' now...

174
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:37,350
...is bunk space in Pelican Bay.

175
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:39,518
Please.

176
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:42,822
What do you guys want?

177
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:45,191
Real estate.

178
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,173
She'll have to be wait-listed
at another shelter.

179
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:04,511
Can't you pull some strings?
She's a neighbor. You're a friend.

180
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,314
I filled my last bed this morning.
What about a hotel?

181
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:09,849
She can't afford a hotel.

182
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,953
I might be able
to double her up someplace.

183
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:15,722
Do, and I'll owe you dinner.

184
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:19,158
Even if I find a spot,
she's not going to go.

185
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:21,995
And I'm partial to steak joints.

186
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:27,133
They don't leave until they call
from the street or the hospital.

187
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:30,803
She didn't even call.
It's a waste of time.

188
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:33,373
Just find a bed.
I'll put her in it.

189
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:37,677
Is that everything?

190
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:41,347
Yes. We're done.

191
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:49,622
Why'd you do this?

192
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:54,327
It just kind of happened.

193
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:57,063
No, I mean...

194
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:01,234
...what made you think
you could fool me?

195
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:05,572
I didn't fool you.

196
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:08,341
I just let you fool yourself.

197
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:15,381
Dutch, how'd it go?

198
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:18,818
- I got everything I needed.
- Good, 'cause we got a case.

199
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:21,254
Woman strangled to death
in Fairview Park.

200
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:24,223
You sure you want my help?

201
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:28,061
According to Aceveda,
I'm moody and distracted.

202
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:31,030
He said that to you?

203
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,203
Why am I even in a police station?
I didn't do anything.

204
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:39,072
Fine. Go home.

205
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:41,574
Next time Prince Charming starts
using you for sparring practice,...

206
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:42,675
...keep it down.

207
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:47,547
Look... I know it's hard
to leave your home.

208
00:10:47,547 --> 00:10:51,417
- It was hard my first time.
- I don't need a damn shelter.

209
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:56,356
Sometimes staying away even one night
makes him realize he's crossed a line.

210
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,958
If you don't do it now...

211
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,793
...you might never get
another chance.

212
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:09,135
- I don't even have any of my stuff.
- Here, give me your keys.

213
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:12,271
- I'll bring you whatever you need.
- I don't want you in my house!

214
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:16,009
I'll get you some clothes.

215
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:22,949
You can't make somebody get help.

216
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,051
Sure you can. Keep working on her.

217
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:27,153
You don't know
what you're talking about.

218
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:29,455
So eight years as a street
cop cleanin' up messes...

219
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:30,757
...like this means nothin'?

220
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:32,392
It's a different game
when you're the one...

221
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:33,860
...on the receiving
end of a fist.

222
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,529
That's why the next time
this guy wakes me up,...

223
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,930
...I'm going to have
a chat with him.

224
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,932
It'll stop. Trust me.

225
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:41,801
Stop violence with violence?

226
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:43,803
Why do men always have the answers?

227
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:45,972
That's a good question.

228
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,148
- Any witnesses?
- No.

229
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:57,684
Couple of teenagers smoking joints
discovered the body.

230
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:00,987
Found her purse and wallet
in the bushes.

231
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:03,723
Her name's Leah Madson.

232
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:05,158
Never seen a victim strangled...

233
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:06,926
...with an over-the-shoulder
boulder holder.

234
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:08,361
I'm not in the mood, Ray.

235
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:11,664
M.E. said no prints
on the victim's body.

236
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,236
Doesn't appear to have been forcibly
removed. Bra's not damaged either.

237
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,671
But the clasp is missing.

238
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:21,574
Probably fell off when
he strangled her.

239
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:23,643
What are you thinking?

240
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:27,647
I don't know.
Rape turned homicide maybe.

241
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:31,350
What's this? Chocolate?

242
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:38,591
It's on her fingers.
Means she helped him remove the bra.

243
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,461
This didn't start off as a rape.

244
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:43,830
- They knew each other.
- Yes.

245
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,264
Guess I'm wrong again.

246
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:51,370
Downtown just faxed
a list of promotions.

247
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:54,674
Stewart and Hernandez
got the two senior lead officer spots.

248
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:57,643
I was next in line for that.

249
00:12:58,211 --> 00:12:59,278
I know.

250
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:04,250
This has to do with the complaint
the widow's been filing against me?

251
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,753
The marijuana I.A.D.
found in my car.

252
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:09,455
I.A.D. believed you. There's no reason
that should have any bearing...

253
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,058
Come on!
That promotion was a lock.

254
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:13,593
You're telling me this
has nothing to do...

255
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:15,495
...with the bogus
complaints put against me?

256
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:20,566
Of course that's what this is about,
but the brass will never admit it.

257
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:23,669
You're going to have to
ride this out.

258
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:29,542
Detective Vendrell.

259
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,377
There's somebody here to see you.

260
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:37,183
Well, well, it's the xxxxx flytrap.
Hope you're not a daddy.

261
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:44,490
Georgia. Can I talk to you?

262
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:47,126
I'm a little busy right now.

263
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,363
I got a case. Illegal activities.

264
00:13:55,835 --> 00:14:00,573
My ex, selling 'scrip drugs
to illegals, grannies...

265
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:02,875
...anyone looking for
a cheap way to medicate.

266
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,777
Sounds like you found
yourself a real winner.

267
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:06,312
I said my ex.

268
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:08,781
Bastard was banging
my neighbor...

269
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:11,217
...while I was sweating my
ass off at the strip club.

270
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:14,153
Figured the best way to pay him back
would just be to drop a dime on him.

271
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:17,089
Still all class?

272
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,159
Are you still upset
about what happened between us?

273
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,961
Nothing happened between us.

274
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,597
Come on. It was just fun.

275
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:27,600
No. It was blackmail.

276
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:30,303
Seriously.

277
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:32,672
My ex, he's a bad dude...

278
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:35,875
...and I would only trust
a really good cop with this.

279
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,913
Look around and take your pick.
I'm not your guy.

280
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:49,322
So why aren't we following up
on Tulips's lead?

281
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:50,857
She's a lying whore.

282
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,859
I trusted her, and she screwed me.

283
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,428
From what I saw that day,
the screwing was mutual.

284
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:57,897
I just don't want to be around her.

285
00:14:58,531 --> 00:15:02,935
So we lose an easy bust on our record
because you got played for a fool?

286
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:08,875
Fine. Fine.

287
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:13,212
Brent. Brent, it's okay.
I got it.

288
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:15,147
You, come with me.

289
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:18,117
Groovy.

290
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,653
You know this woman, Stu?

291
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:27,426
This girl at the rib joint I work at
set me up with her.

292
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:29,061
Went out with her last night?

293
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:30,830
We met at her
place at 9:00.

294
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,965
How long did you stay?

295
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:35,268
I didn't. I wasn't attracted to her.

296
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:37,637
I figured, why waste both our time?

297
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:39,805
- Where'd you go then?
- Home.

298
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:43,376
- Anyone who can corroborate that?
- I don't think so.

299
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:45,912
I just went home, watched some TV.

300
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,715
Any word on Stu's alibi?

301
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:51,517
No one to confirm or deny.

302
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:52,718
What about his
coworkers?

303
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:54,820
I'm heading over to
talk to them now.

304
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:57,757
Long as I'm not too moody
to change my mind...

305
00:15:57,757 --> 00:16:00,092
...or too distracted
to lose my way.

306
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,197
Why is what I said to
you in confidence...

307
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:06,999
...about Dutch
coming back to me?

308
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,602
Because his results lately
are a concern.

309
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:11,504
I was concerned about
Dutch personally,...

310
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:13,072
...not about his
job performance.

311
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:15,975
It's not just me. This is the chief.

312
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:19,011
Bob and Marcy were a serious
black eye for us.

313
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:22,281
It happened right under the nose
of our civilian auditor.

314
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:25,151
- Is Lanie behind this?
- She hasn't been here in a few weeks.

315
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:26,686
Who knows who
she's talking to?

316
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:31,424
Until further notice, you'll be
lead investigator on all your cases.

317
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:35,394
How is Dutch supposed to
get back on the horse...

318
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:36,896
...when you cut him
off at the knees?

319
00:16:36,896 --> 00:16:38,564
I just don't want to see
him screw up again.

320
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:39,665
He won't.

321
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:40,866
I hope not.

322
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,935
Because if he does,...

323
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:44,937
- I can't protect him anymore.
- Why?

324
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:47,306
Too busy protecting Vic?

325
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,223
Who the hell are you?
What the...

326
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:06,759
- I'm a cop.
- What do you want?

327
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:10,529
Look, I don't know what she told you,
but she's a lying bitch.

328
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,399
She said it was all her fault.
You didn't touch her.

329
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,935
The lying bitch.

330
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:21,474
Where you going?

331
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:25,911
Where is she, man?

332
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,314
What, you sleepin' with her
or somethin'?

333
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:32,518
Answer me, man!

334
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,689
That's not hers. It's my sister's.
Give it back.

335
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:38,057
I said give it back!

336
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:41,627
Thanks, asshole.

337
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:43,596
You just made me a very happy man.

338
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:50,169
Thank you
for bringing lunch.

339
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:52,938
Wait till you see the spread you get
when you're actually my husband.

340
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:59,545
So it's okay if I drop off Randall
later when I get my dress fitted?

341
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:00,946
Sure.

342
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:03,749
What's wrong? You seem
a little distracted.

343
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:07,420
Don't tell me. Cold feet.

344
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,555
No, no. No.

345
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:12,591
So?

346
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:19,265
The prayer group that I go to on
Thursday night isn't just Bible study.

347
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:20,900
What else is it?

348
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:24,070
It's also a sexual
reorientation group.

349
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:26,806
Reorientation?

350
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:29,742
I've made some bad choices
in my past.

351
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,113
- Bad relationship choices.
- We all have.

352
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,247
It's okay.

353
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:44,156
I used to be attracted to men...

354
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:47,560
...but through counseling and
the grace of God and Jesus,...

355
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,928
- ...I've straightened myself.
- You're gay?

356
00:18:48,928 --> 00:18:52,865
- No. No, I am not.
- God. God.

357
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,168
Randall looks to you
like you're his father.

358
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:59,672
Vanessa. Vanessa. I am the man
that God intended me to be.

359
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:03,109
I am with a beautiful woman.
I'm about to start a family.

360
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:06,278
I love you.
I just didn't want any secrets.

361
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:07,780
When was the last time
you were with a guy?

362
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,215
It has been months.

363
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:11,283
I've been in this group for months.

364
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:14,854
You had sex with a man?

365
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:23,028
I have made mistakes in my past...

366
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:26,565
...but I am begging you for your
understanding and your forgiveness.

367
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:30,870
I need you. I need you.

368
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:37,009
I need to think.

369
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:50,222
Baby! Baby!
Baby, tell them it's all good with us!

370
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:53,225
You said you wouldn't arrest him!
He's on parole!

371
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:55,761
If he goes to jail, he loses his job.
I lose my apartment.

372
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,730
You stay alive, and I
get some goddamn sleep.

373
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:00,699
- Keep your hands off her!
- He didn't hit me. Let him go.

374
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:01,834
- Stay back.
- I'll take her.

375
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:03,068
Baby, get me out of here.

376
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:05,604
- Call Skeeter. He knows a bail guy.
- Shut up.

377
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,207
A couple can hit each other,
hate each other...

378
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,342
...but tell them they're
wrong for each other,...

379
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:12,545
...they look at you like
you're speaking in tongues.

380
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:15,147
I never heard that before.

381
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:17,149
You actually thought she
wouldn't go back to him?

382
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,985
Are you unromantic or just dumb?

383
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:22,688
I just didn't want to
hear 'em in my living room anymore.

384
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:24,957
It's harder to get out
than you think.

385
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:29,728
- Like the bad boys, did we?
- It had its appeal for a while.

386
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:33,232
And then it didn't.
She hasn't hit bottom.

387
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:35,067
She's not ready for me yet.

388
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:37,203
He touches her again, he's mine.

389
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:40,206
You just can't stand
anything you can't control.

390
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:42,341
That's part of my dance.

391
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:53,920
Your coworkers say you're a bit
obsessive about your weight.

392
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:57,757
Summers at fat farms,
dozens of diets...

393
00:20:57,757 --> 00:21:00,293
...weight training,
yoga, running.

394
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,596
- All true.
- What happened with Susan Lane?

395
00:21:04,364 --> 00:21:07,233
Aggravated assault
when you were 12 years old.

396
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:08,801
That's what they called it.
She didn't want people...

397
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:10,370
...to think she was a slut.

398
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:13,706
Now, you and some other kids
were playing spin-the-bottle.

399
00:21:13,706 --> 00:21:16,242
On her spin,
the bottle pointed to you.

400
00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:27,787
She was supposed to kiss you.
She refused. You were humiliated.

401
00:21:28,187 --> 00:21:32,325
So 11 years later, I killed
some chick? Come on!

402
00:21:32,325 --> 00:21:34,927
A few days later, you followed
Susan home from school.

403
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:37,330
You told her to kiss you.
She refused.

404
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:39,465
You struck her.
You broke her nose.

405
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:42,068
She tried to kiss me. I wouldn't.

406
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:44,804
She slapped me, so I hit her.

407
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:47,907
You were the last person
to see Leah Madson alive, Stu.

408
00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:51,110
- Except the killer.
- Yes, except the killer.

409
00:21:57,283 --> 00:21:59,485
Pretty quiet in there. Any thoughts?

410
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:02,989
Hard to read.

411
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:06,793
Let's check his apartment, see
what we can come up with.

412
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,828
Yes.

413
00:22:11,764 --> 00:22:14,600
Keep it short and simple. Tell him
I got a supply, I need a buyer.

414
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,403
Just get a time and place
and then hang up the phone.

415
00:22:17,403 --> 00:22:20,239
- How come you don't look at me?
- What?

416
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,008
You don't look at me.

417
00:22:23,076 --> 00:22:25,278
Just make the goddamn call.

418
00:22:39,392 --> 00:22:40,493
It's me.

419
00:22:41,894 --> 00:22:43,196
Look, I don't want to fight.

420
00:22:43,596 --> 00:22:45,865
I've got a guy who wants to
hook you up with some product.

421
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:49,469
Hell, Yes, I'm still pissed,
but you know what? A buck's a buck.

422
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,877
- Danny, find the bra clasp?
- Nothing yet.

423
00:22:57,877 --> 00:23:00,513
I'm guessing it's here
or in his car.

424
00:23:01,314 --> 00:23:03,549
Maybe on a shoe or...

425
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:10,990
We find that bra clasp,
we've got this guy dead to rights.

426
00:23:11,758 --> 00:23:12,959
We're lookin'.

427
00:23:23,936 --> 00:23:25,238
Odd place.

428
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,814
What's it tell you about our guy?

429
00:23:36,616 --> 00:23:37,817
I don't know.

430
00:23:37,817 --> 00:23:42,021
You must be thinking something.
What's your gut tell you?

431
00:23:43,956 --> 00:23:46,259
There are red flags
everywhere with this guy.

432
00:23:46,893 --> 00:23:50,296
- Red flags for what?
- Possible serial predator.

433
00:23:50,296 --> 00:23:52,532
- Think he's a serial killer?
- Or a rapist.

434
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:55,701
He has the makings of one
the obsession with detail...

435
00:23:55,701 --> 00:23:58,337
...the reliance on fantasy.

436
00:23:58,337 --> 00:23:59,605
They're warning posts.

437
00:24:00,973 --> 00:24:04,911
He's young, and if he is one, I'm
guessing Leah's his first or second.

438
00:24:07,046 --> 00:24:09,882
- You know, it's a bunch of crap.
- No, no.

439
00:24:09,882 --> 00:24:12,318
We got nothing else to go on.
It's worth exploring.

440
00:24:12,318 --> 00:24:14,120
We need to find the
bra clasp, people.

441
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,454
Our guys are already on it.

442
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:19,225
Let's go back to the barn,
get a confession from Stu.

443
00:24:19,926 --> 00:24:22,995
- I don't have anything to work with.
- You've done it before.

444
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:24,730
I'm going to head back
to the crime scene,...

445
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,532
...make sure those guys
didn't miss anything.

446
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:40,379
Three, four million, I can get you
a few 10-acre lots in Castro Peak.

447
00:24:41,013 --> 00:24:42,949
They'll appreciate nice
in a few years.

448
00:24:42,949 --> 00:24:46,652
Nothing in your name,
but you'll have total control.

449
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:49,322
- All cash.
- All cash.

450
00:24:50,056 --> 00:24:51,858
I usually get
a five-percent commission.

451
00:24:51,858 --> 00:24:53,392
Why don't we make it ten percent?

452
00:24:57,296 --> 00:24:58,331
Ten?

453
00:24:58,631 --> 00:24:59,632
Good faith.

454
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,404
Plus a little extra money,
since you're taking the extra risk.

455
00:25:06,806 --> 00:25:08,174
What extra risk?

456
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:09,675
Well...

457
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:12,411
...if you even think
about rattin' us out...

458
00:25:13,112 --> 00:25:15,214
...we tell the four drug dealers
you've been doin' business...

459
00:25:15,214 --> 00:25:16,782
...with that you ratted them out.

460
00:25:17,216 --> 00:25:18,517
Bang, bang.

461
00:25:21,087 --> 00:25:22,221
I understand.

462
00:25:29,061 --> 00:25:31,297
Look, you guys searched
my apartment, right?

463
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:35,801
There was nothing there.
I'd be hearing about it if there was.

464
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:38,771
If you're so innocent, maybe you'd
like to take a lie detector test?

465
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:40,306
No.

466
00:25:42,475 --> 00:25:43,676
Afraid of something?

467
00:25:44,677 --> 00:25:46,746
No, I just hear
they're not so reliable.

468
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:50,549
What if I took it, and it said
I was guilty when I'm not?

469
00:25:56,422 --> 00:25:59,892
He's suspicious but clean.
Dutch has a theory though.

470
00:26:00,693 --> 00:26:02,194
What's your theory, Claudette?

471
00:26:02,461 --> 00:26:04,797
I don't have one. Ask Dutch.

472
00:26:04,797 --> 00:26:06,032
It's nothing.

473
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:08,701
He thinks Stu's guilty.

474
00:26:08,701 --> 00:26:11,003
He shows signs of being a predator.

475
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:15,007
- We have any proof?
- There are definite warning signs.

476
00:26:15,374 --> 00:26:17,109
He refused to take
a lie detector,...

477
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:19,378
...talked about getting
a false guilty reading.

478
00:26:19,378 --> 00:26:20,913
Nobody who's innocent does that.

479
00:26:23,482 --> 00:26:26,385
Thinking he's guilty is one thing,
proving it's another.

480
00:26:27,853 --> 00:26:30,556
Find out who did it
and close this case.

481
00:26:37,196 --> 00:26:38,965
A night at a shelter is
a good first step,...

482
00:26:38,965 --> 00:26:40,399
...so how do we get
her to take it?

483
00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:44,403
- Not by forcing her caveman style.
- I do have to get some sleep.

484
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,839
And I want to see her
stay in one piece.

485
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:49,875
I have been known in dire times
of resorting to trickery.

486
00:26:51,978 --> 00:26:54,146
If I spend a night
in the shelter...

487
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:57,183
Dez won't have to
spend a night in jail.

488
00:26:58,584 --> 00:27:00,186
It's a new city law.

489
00:27:01,187 --> 00:27:03,489
We have to hold alleged
abusers overnight...

490
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,558
...for the woman's safety.

491
00:27:08,361 --> 00:27:11,731
Okay, then. I want to try your place
for a night.

492
00:27:12,331 --> 00:27:13,366
Good.

493
00:27:33,085 --> 00:27:36,322
Nice tits. How much they cost?

494
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:38,224
Hundred percent natural. Jealous?

495
00:27:38,224 --> 00:27:41,027
- Is she legal?
- Born in Inglewood.

496
00:27:41,027 --> 00:27:43,062
I meant is she
18, stupid?

497
00:27:43,062 --> 00:27:44,463
<i>Yes, and I take her
</i>everywhere with me.

498
00:27:44,463 --> 00:27:47,499
- <i>She doesn't piss me off.
</i>- Screw you.

499
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:50,569
- Not anymore.
- And you miss it. He gets it all now.

500
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:52,405
So this asshole's
your new boyfriend?

501
00:27:52,405 --> 00:27:53,539
Yes, it's a relief...

502
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:55,808
- ...not having to fake it anymore.
- Can we get down to business?

503
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:58,677
So what you got?

504
00:27:59,412 --> 00:28:03,115
- Ex, oxy, pot, mash, stash, Rx.
- I need Viagra.

505
00:28:03,115 --> 00:28:04,417
Yes, you do.

506
00:28:05,151 --> 00:28:06,952
Anything to make it bigger
like my man's?

507
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,222
- I need "V" and Ex. That'll be all.
- How much weight you need?

508
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:13,225
Start out slow.
How 'bout five-grand worth?

509
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:14,894
Five grand?
Yes, I'm your man.

510
00:28:14,894 --> 00:28:16,228
Don't forget
about my cut.

511
00:28:16,228 --> 00:28:18,564
I pay loverboy. You get
your money from him.

512
00:28:18,564 --> 00:28:21,067
- That wasn't the deal.
- Is now.

513
00:28:21,067 --> 00:28:23,502
- Just get in the car, dear.
- Anything you say, honey.

514
00:28:29,275 --> 00:28:30,309
Here you go.

515
00:28:35,681 --> 00:28:36,849
You got the money?

516
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,091
Here's your 5K.

517
00:28:45,658 --> 00:28:47,059
If this stuff sucks,...

518
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:49,095
- ...I'm comin' after her.
- Be my guest.

519
00:28:49,095 --> 00:28:50,229
He doesn't mean that.

520
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:51,630
- That's love talk.
- Let's go.

521
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,602
All right. Let's go.
Piggies in the air!

522
00:28:56,602 --> 00:28:57,937
Right now! Turn around!

523
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:01,207
Come on! Turn around, high life boy!
Let's go! Hands on your head.

524
00:29:01,207 --> 00:29:03,542
You too, darling. Let's go.
Hands on your head.

525
00:29:03,943 --> 00:29:08,047
You dumb a-hole! You just got busted
by my new big-xxxx boyfriend!

526
00:29:08,447 --> 00:29:10,015
How does it feel, you fag?

527
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:14,086
- How does it feel?
- Shut up!

528
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:17,690
Will you shut up? Damn it.

529
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:30,937
You ever know somebody's guilty...

530
00:29:30,937 --> 00:29:32,538
...but you just don't
have the evidence?

531
00:29:33,106 --> 00:29:35,375
- On occasion.
- How do you handle it?

532
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:39,145
You wearin' a wire?

533
00:29:39,979 --> 00:29:41,714
I'm tired of people
gettin' away with murder.

534
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,822
Sometimes the evidence fits the case.

535
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:54,694
Sometimes you got to
make the evidence fit the case.

536
00:29:56,663 --> 00:29:58,131
If you know the guy did it.

537
00:30:27,026 --> 00:30:28,594
<i>We're still working it.</i>

538
00:30:35,468 --> 00:30:38,471
- Still didn't find anything?
- The place is clean.

539
00:30:38,471 --> 00:30:41,107
- I'm going to take one last look.
- Sure.

540
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:06,966
- Well?
- You sure you were thorough?

541
00:31:06,966 --> 00:31:09,769
- Yes.
- Do me a favor. Check one more time.

542
00:31:09,769 --> 00:31:12,739
The trash, his clothes.

543
00:31:12,739 --> 00:31:15,708
- You going to sign for the overtime?
- Yes. Just be sure.

544
00:31:45,505 --> 00:31:46,639
Yes?

545
00:31:47,707 --> 00:31:49,142
I think I left somethin'.

546
00:32:18,337 --> 00:32:20,673
- You okay?
- Yes. You?

547
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,709
Actually, I'm not. I'm having...

548
00:32:26,179 --> 00:32:27,847
A really bad day.

549
00:32:29,916 --> 00:32:31,684
We busted him, didn't we?

550
00:32:31,684 --> 00:32:33,719
This whole thing was about
you burning some guy...

551
00:32:33,719 --> 00:32:35,221
...who dumped you for
somebody hotter.

552
00:32:35,221 --> 00:32:36,889
It was not.

553
00:32:37,356 --> 00:32:40,426
And no way was that taco tart
hotter than me.

554
00:32:40,793 --> 00:32:44,063
- You don't think so, do you?
- I think you use people.

555
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:47,300
You're really upset with me.

556
00:32:48,334 --> 00:32:50,303
You got what you wanted.
Just get out of here.

557
00:32:51,404 --> 00:32:52,772
My God.

558
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,709
I really hurt you,
just like he hurt me.

559
00:32:56,709 --> 00:32:59,312
- I'm sorry.
- Doesn't matter.

560
00:33:01,314 --> 00:33:03,049
I'm always falling
for the wrong guys...

561
00:33:03,049 --> 00:33:05,017
...when I'd just be better off
with someone like you.

562
00:33:05,017 --> 00:33:07,954
Yes, you would,
but you'll never know.

563
00:33:13,426 --> 00:33:14,760
Come on. Let's get out of here.

564
00:33:16,762 --> 00:33:18,865
I got like six hours
left on my shift.

565
00:33:21,701 --> 00:33:25,338
Well, don't you have to
interrogate me or something?

566
00:33:25,338 --> 00:33:27,406
You know, just to wrap it up.

567
00:33:51,397 --> 00:33:54,166
- Come on. I'm bailed. Let's go, baby.
- She's not going home with you.

568
00:33:54,166 --> 00:33:57,236
- You stay out of my business.
- She's not going home with you.

569
00:33:57,236 --> 00:33:59,205
- Emma?
- I'm doing this for you.

570
00:33:59,205 --> 00:34:00,706
- It's the law.
- What law?

571
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:02,541
They can't keep us apart.
Come on. Let's go.

572
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:04,110
She needs a break from
your macho bullshit,...

573
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:05,678
...so go hit somebody else tonight.

574
00:34:05,678 --> 00:34:07,113
You want some too?

575
00:34:11,651 --> 00:34:12,885
Dez!

576
00:34:14,954 --> 00:34:18,324
What's going on?
Stay still. Stay still.

577
00:34:25,331 --> 00:34:26,732
It was self-defense.

578
00:34:26,732 --> 00:34:29,335
- She pushed a man off the balcony.
- He was attacking her.

579
00:34:30,303 --> 00:34:33,606
It happened on our property. There
are legal and civil considerations.

580
00:34:33,606 --> 00:34:36,042
- I don't want her in the cage.
- Then bail her out.

581
00:34:37,643 --> 00:34:38,844
Thanks for your help.

582
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,622
- Come on. Let's go.
- Where?

583
00:34:53,626 --> 00:34:55,995
- What are you doing?
- Had some bad mojo in there lately.

584
00:34:55,995 --> 00:34:57,296
I need a new room.

585
00:34:58,564 --> 00:35:00,032
It's all yours, Dutch-boy.

586
00:35:06,138 --> 00:35:08,441
You couldn't take a lie detector
if you wanted to...

587
00:35:08,441 --> 00:35:09,976
...because the wire
wouldn't fit around...

588
00:35:09,976 --> 00:35:12,378
- ...that thick wrist of yours.
- What?

589
00:35:12,378 --> 00:35:14,847
You know what word
you never use, Stu?

590
00:35:14,847 --> 00:35:18,617
"Fat." I bet people don't call
you that to your face either.

591
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:22,121
They're too polite. They should,
though, because you are fat.

592
00:35:22,555 --> 00:35:24,790
You were a fat baby.
You were a fat little kid...

593
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,993
...and now you're just
a goddamn whale.

594
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,962
I've busted black killers...

595
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:32,765
...white killers,
smart killers, dumb killers.

596
00:35:33,265 --> 00:35:35,701
Never anybody as fat as you.

597
00:35:35,701 --> 00:35:39,405
See, the bra you used to
strangle Leah with...

598
00:35:39,405 --> 00:35:40,906
...the clasp was broken.

599
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:44,243
Your fat fingers
weren't nimble enough to unclasp it...

600
00:35:44,243 --> 00:35:47,113
...so you just ripped it off her,
didn't you, Stu?

601
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:52,418
Which means that bra clasp
is somewhere in your house...

602
00:35:52,418 --> 00:35:56,956
...your car, your extra, extra,
extra-large clothes.

603
00:35:59,425 --> 00:36:01,761
I don't need a lie detector, Stu.

604
00:36:02,128 --> 00:36:04,230
I can get you on physical evidence.

605
00:36:05,498 --> 00:36:07,066
And let me tell you something.

606
00:36:07,733 --> 00:36:10,136
A jail cell feels small...

607
00:36:10,136 --> 00:36:11,937
...to someone my size.

608
00:36:14,707 --> 00:36:16,075
He's going too far.

609
00:36:18,711 --> 00:36:21,113
- You can't get me.
- I'm going to get you right here.

610
00:36:21,113 --> 00:36:22,982
I'm unstoppable.

611
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,221
Big guy, your mom's here.

612
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:32,958
- Baby.
- Mom.

613
00:36:36,028 --> 00:36:38,230
Baby, keep your grandma company.
She's in the car.

614
00:36:38,798 --> 00:36:41,667
- I parked it out back, okay?
- Okay. See you, Julien.

615
00:36:41,667 --> 00:36:42,968
See you later, big guy.

616
00:36:51,177 --> 00:36:53,379
- You should've told me sooner.
- I know.

617
00:36:53,779 --> 00:36:54,980
I'm sorry.

618
00:36:57,149 --> 00:37:00,719
I believe you when you say
that you've changed.

619
00:37:01,554 --> 00:37:04,156
- I believe in the power of our Lord.
- Thank you.

620
00:37:04,156 --> 00:37:05,291
But...

621
00:37:08,194 --> 00:37:12,031
...if you ever feel
like you want to be with a man...

622
00:37:12,031 --> 00:37:14,433
- I won't. I won't. I never...
- I need...

623
00:37:14,433 --> 00:37:16,235
I never will be again.

624
00:37:16,669 --> 00:37:19,472
I'm going to make
the two of you so happy.

625
00:37:27,947 --> 00:37:29,081
Kiss me.

626
00:37:53,706 --> 00:37:54,874
Okay.

627
00:37:56,275 --> 00:38:00,279
Well, I have a hundred things to do
before the wedding.

628
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:01,447
Okay.

629
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:03,949
Okay.

630
00:38:06,318 --> 00:38:07,520
So...

631
00:38:09,388 --> 00:38:11,290
So the wedding's still on?

632
00:38:12,158 --> 00:38:13,993
Don't keep me waiting
up there, okay?

633
00:38:15,027 --> 00:38:16,195
Never.

634
00:38:25,371 --> 00:38:27,806
- She's a beautiful girl.
- Yes.

635
00:38:28,407 --> 00:38:30,442
I guess I must have
missed somethin'.

636
00:38:34,413 --> 00:38:38,050
Last person I saw you kissin'
was a little more male.

637
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:43,656
- You sure you know what you're doin'?
- Yes.

638
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,430
In that case, congratulations.

639
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:02,942
When was the last time you saw
your xxxx without using a mirror?

640
00:39:03,209 --> 00:39:04,343
Shut up.

641
00:39:05,444 --> 00:39:09,014
So you got set up on a blind date
with Leah Madson.

642
00:39:11,617 --> 00:39:15,054
I mean, her friend was cute.
You must have expected a hottie.

643
00:39:15,421 --> 00:39:18,224
Nope. Instead it's big, fat Leah.

644
00:39:20,526 --> 00:39:23,629
I mean, you deserve better, right?

645
00:39:23,629 --> 00:39:25,731
- I get better.
- No, you don't.

646
00:39:26,165 --> 00:39:28,300
Women won't sleep with you.

647
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:31,303
So you're horny.

648
00:39:32,104 --> 00:39:34,907
You figure, what the hell...
park's dark.

649
00:39:34,907 --> 00:39:37,843
What's the old joke about fat chicks?

650
00:39:38,444 --> 00:39:41,113
Roll 'em in flour
and aim for the wet spot.

651
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:45,351
Is that what it's like?

652
00:39:45,351 --> 00:39:47,886
- I wasn't attracted to her.
- I know.

653
00:39:48,687 --> 00:39:52,157
Leah was fat. She couldn't stop
eating. She had no control.

654
00:39:52,157 --> 00:39:53,726
You hated that.

655
00:39:54,526 --> 00:39:56,095
But there you are...

656
00:39:56,662 --> 00:39:58,497
...on that park bench...

657
00:39:58,497 --> 00:40:02,067
...hating yourself for every minute
you can't control your little hard-on.

658
00:40:06,171 --> 00:40:07,940
You had this
in your fridge for years.

659
00:40:08,874 --> 00:40:10,309
Never took a bite.

660
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,515
The chocolate bar
was the trigger.

661
00:40:17,549 --> 00:40:19,218
You wanted
to get laid.

662
00:40:19,218 --> 00:40:21,720
All she could think about was
the candy in her pocket.

663
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,922
She pulled it out,
and you just lost it.

664
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:25,124
Strangled her with
the same bra...

665
00:40:25,124 --> 00:40:27,559
...your fat fingers were
fumbling to get off of her.

666
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:29,061
That's not who I am.

667
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:33,699
- Yes.
- Tell him you found the bra clasp.

668
00:40:35,801 --> 00:40:36,935
Good to know.

669
00:40:38,037 --> 00:40:39,972
We found
the bra clasp, Stu.

670
00:40:40,339 --> 00:40:41,573
It was in your car.

671
00:40:42,374 --> 00:40:45,311
- I'm not fat.
- Yes, you're not fat.

672
00:40:45,711 --> 00:40:49,281
I'll kill you too!
Say I'm fat! Say I'm fat!

673
00:40:49,281 --> 00:40:52,484
I'm going to be thin!
I am! I'm going to be!

674
00:40:52,484 --> 00:40:53,852
I'm going to be thin!

675
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,155
Help! Get some help!
Get off of him!

676
00:40:56,155 --> 00:40:59,325
Come on! Get off! Get off!

677
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:03,562
Don't move. Don't move.
Cuffhim up.

678
00:41:09,502 --> 00:41:10,736
Ronnie.

679
00:41:11,571 --> 00:41:12,839
Shane got the
pictures back.

680
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:15,308
I don't want 'em lying around
for anyone else to find.

681
00:41:15,308 --> 00:41:17,176
- Can you run 'em by my place?
- Sure.

682
00:41:17,176 --> 00:41:21,247
Listen, while you're there,
can you get my checkbook?

683
00:41:21,681 --> 00:41:22,882
How come?

684
00:41:24,016 --> 00:41:27,053
State won't pony up the money
for a decent burial for Connie.

685
00:41:27,954 --> 00:41:29,689
I figure it's the least I can do.

686
00:41:31,624 --> 00:41:34,961
Careful out there. I hear the Thai
food delivery guys are packin' heat.

687
00:41:35,328 --> 00:41:37,463
- You guys are xxxxs.
- Jesus!

688
00:41:37,663 --> 00:41:40,399
Take a joke! God!

689
00:41:44,237 --> 00:41:45,404
If he's freakin'
out now,...

690
00:41:45,404 --> 00:41:47,206
...how's he going to be
takin' down the money train?

691
00:41:47,206 --> 00:41:49,342
Or when it comes time
to take care of Armadillo?

692
00:41:49,342 --> 00:41:51,244
You trust him every day
bustin' down doors.

693
00:41:51,244 --> 00:41:54,213
Doesn't mean I trust him to sit
on a few million for a year or two.

694
00:41:54,213 --> 00:41:56,082
Money does strange things to people.

695
00:41:58,684 --> 00:42:00,386
All right. We'll keep
an eye on Ronnie.

696
00:42:01,988 --> 00:42:03,322
You finish up
with Tulips?

697
00:42:03,322 --> 00:42:05,491
Yes, it was a clean bust.
No hitches.

698
00:42:05,491 --> 00:42:08,461
- Nice work.
- Yes.

699
00:42:16,068 --> 00:42:17,403
Nice job.

700
00:42:18,271 --> 00:42:19,739
Don't sound so surprised.

701
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:22,508
Well, I was just worried
about you for a little while.

702
00:42:22,808 --> 00:42:24,410
You should have had
more faith in me.

703
00:42:26,178 --> 00:42:28,714
- Nice work.
- I know.

704
00:42:29,582 --> 00:42:31,918
- I'm glad.
- You should be.

705
00:42:32,285 --> 00:42:35,321
I break cases nobody else
in this division can.

706
00:42:35,721 --> 00:42:37,823
I deserve a little more
goddamn respect...

707
00:42:37,823 --> 00:42:39,825
...than I've been getting
around here lately.

708
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:42,495
You wanted me to close a case
without incident?

709
00:42:42,962 --> 00:42:44,096
I did it.

710
00:42:46,966 --> 00:42:48,167
I guess he's back.

711
00:42:48,834 --> 00:42:50,269
I guess so.

712
00:42:56,976 --> 00:43:00,212
You run off to Mexico and miss your
court date, you owe me three grand.

713
00:43:01,614 --> 00:43:04,383
You play with fire,
that's the chance you'll take.

714
00:43:06,419 --> 00:43:07,586
Is he okay?

715
00:43:08,187 --> 00:43:09,455
Unfortunately.

716
00:43:10,456 --> 00:43:13,159
- Guess I should feel bad.
- Don't.

717
00:43:16,228 --> 00:43:17,430
Sorry.

718
00:43:18,731 --> 00:43:21,434
- Hello?
- Matthew's been asking for you.

719
00:43:21,634 --> 00:43:24,503
- He wants to say hi.
- Great. Put him on.

720
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:27,340
Okay.
Say hi to Daddy.

721
00:43:28,107 --> 00:43:29,909
Matthew, say hi to Daddy.

722
00:43:30,109 --> 00:43:31,344
<i>On the phone.</i>

723
00:43:31,644 --> 00:43:33,112
Talk into the phone.

724
00:43:35,181 --> 00:43:37,249
Say hi.

725
00:43:37,249 --> 00:43:40,152
Matthew? Buddy.

726
00:43:40,152 --> 00:43:42,888
It's Daddy.
Did you go to school today?

727
00:43:43,155 --> 00:43:44,423
<i>Did you have fun?</i>

728
00:43:45,825 --> 00:43:47,026
Matthew?

729
00:43:49,328 --> 00:43:51,063
You know, I'm sorry.

730
00:43:52,098 --> 00:43:54,533
He was talking just a second ago.

731
00:43:54,767 --> 00:43:58,437
- It's okay. Thanks for trying.
- Okay.

732
00:43:58,437 --> 00:44:00,940
- <i>I'm sorry.
</i>- No, no, no. It's okay.

733
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:02,475
Thanks. I'll see you.

734
00:44:05,945 --> 00:44:07,279
Your dog or your kid?

735
00:44:08,414 --> 00:44:10,483
Kid. One of three.

736
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:12,284
I'm more a dog person.

737
00:44:13,419 --> 00:44:14,520
Wife?

738
00:44:15,821 --> 00:44:17,123
Separated.

739
00:44:38,477 --> 00:44:40,880
- Wait. Wait.
- What's wrong?

740
00:44:42,014 --> 00:44:43,282
What's that smell?

741
00:44:55,561 --> 00:44:57,897
- What's goin' on?
- Get down.

742
00:45:03,102 --> 00:45:04,336
Stay down.

743
00:45:15,748 --> 00:45:17,049
Ronnie!

744
00:45:17,049 --> 00:45:20,019
- My God.
- Call an ambulance.

745
00:45:24,123 --> 00:45:25,324
Ronnie.

746
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:28,661
Vic.
