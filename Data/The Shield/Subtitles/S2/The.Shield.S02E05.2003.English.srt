1
00:00:00,934 --> 00:00:02,469
<i>Previously on The Shield.</i>

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:03,636
You need help.

3
00:00:03,636 --> 00:00:04,904
I can't...

4
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:08,308
- ...be helped.
- He needs his mother.

5
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:12,946
I do things that can't be forgiven.

6
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:14,747
You're gay, okay?

7
00:00:14,747 --> 00:00:17,550
I'm not allowed to ask someone
out on a date while I'm on duty...

8
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,918
Come by.

9
00:00:18,918 --> 00:00:20,220
Maybe I'll be home.

10
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:26,159
Your dead guys
may have been cooked up...

11
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:27,694
...by a couple of Mexican nationals.

12
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,395
Quintero. They're
brothers...

13
00:00:29,395 --> 00:00:30,930
Navaro and Armadillo.

14
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,966
- Armadillo Quintero?
- Yes?

15
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:36,769
You're a prime suspect in the fire
murders of two men last night.

16
00:00:36,769 --> 00:00:39,405
You're not here to fight
the Toros and the Los Mags.

17
00:00:39,405 --> 00:00:40,707
You're here to unite 'em.

18
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:43,610
This what your brother Armadillo
does to people who don't cooperate?

19
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,346
I say we can
let him start doin' his time.

20
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:47,413
You planning to leave?

21
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:50,316
I don't have to leave.

22
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:56,122
Tell me you're leaving. Say it!

23
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:58,024
- Say it!
- Vic!

24
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,730
You ever heard a rumor
about a money train?

25
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,164
<i>Supposedly runs out of L.A.
</i>every couple of months...

26
00:01:05,164 --> 00:01:07,033
<i>...to clean their
</i>dirty money overseas.

27
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:09,435
You can't really be talkin'
about making off...

28
00:01:09,435 --> 00:01:12,805
...with the Armenian mob's
entire Western U.S. kitty.

29
00:01:12,805 --> 00:01:14,240
Right into our pockets.

30
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:20,613
- I hear you're the best.
- Heat it up.

31
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:29,289
<i>What's up, boss?</i>

32
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:35,929
While you two
were out playing putt-putt...

33
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,498
<i>Shane and me were taking down
</i>a slice-and-dice gem operation...

34
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:40,967
...an Armenian kingpin,
two dozen of his crew.

35
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:42,602
<i>One guy who shall remain faceless.</i>

36
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,771
I can't believe
we missed out on that, man.

37
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:48,007
It gets better. It gets better.
We found out the Zeroun family...

38
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:51,477
...isn't only making illegal money,
they're also cleaning and shipping it.

39
00:01:51,477 --> 00:01:54,847
So we're going to take down
a money-laundering ring? Sweet.

40
00:01:54,847 --> 00:01:57,417
Yes, it is. We're going
to bring it down,...

41
00:01:57,417 --> 00:02:00,486
...pack it up, and save
it for a rainy day.

42
00:02:00,486 --> 00:02:03,656
We found out how and where
they distribute their dirty cash.

43
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:06,626
This is it, boys. This is the
one we've been waiting for.

44
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:09,662
One big hit. In and out.
We're set for good.

45
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:11,598
- What?
- Told you he'd be speechless.

46
00:02:12,498 --> 00:02:15,735
You're not serious.
You want to rip off the Armenian mob?

47
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:20,707
We have two months to plan this.
We can absolutely do this.

48
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,743
- No. Not me.
- What are you saying? It's all of us.

49
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:26,312
No, man. It's crazy.
It can't be that easy.

50
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,883
We'd have the mob chasing us
on one side, the law on the other.

51
00:02:30,883 --> 00:02:33,152
What about you? You bailing too?

52
00:02:33,152 --> 00:02:36,589
No. No.
It sounds interesting.

53
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:39,492
Lem, no one's rushing into this.

54
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:51,971
- Do you know a Connie Reisler?
- Yes. Why?

55
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:53,072
She's here.

56
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,274
Man.

57
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:03,449
Hi, Vic.

58
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:10,023
- You're clean.
- Yes.

59
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:13,926
I did 90 in County.

60
00:03:13,926 --> 00:03:15,395
It must have been hard on you.

61
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:17,397
It's what I needed.

62
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:24,437
What do you need from me?

63
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:27,140
I want to
help you.

64
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:29,909
Provide information on
a professional basis.

65
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:31,010
Look, Connie...

66
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:33,713
I'm here for you.

67
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:36,783
But I don't have throwaway money
like I used to.

68
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:41,254
I'm talking about making it official.
I met someone inside.

69
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:43,823
Told me that the state
can give C.I.s a contract.

70
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,526
I can do that.

71
00:03:48,327 --> 00:03:50,463
I hear things all the time.

72
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:56,002
<i>I blend in on the street.</i>

73
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,972
- No.
- Well, I'm tired...

74
00:03:59,972 --> 00:04:02,575
...of sucking on pipes and balls, Vic.

75
00:04:05,344 --> 00:04:07,947
You know my resume?
Who else is going to give me a job?

76
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:09,449
It's not as simple
as all that.

77
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,384
I don't need that
much to live on.

78
00:04:11,984 --> 00:04:16,422
Without it, you know,
I got to go back to trickin'

79
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:20,293
I start trickin',
it's back to being a junkie.

80
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:25,932
I heard about this guy...

81
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,368
...who's selling heroin to kids.

82
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,304
Yes?

83
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,606
This tip's real solid.

84
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:38,044
Okay. I'll see what
I can do long-term.

85
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:40,813
In the meantime,
tell me about this dealer.

86
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:45,752
Teenage kid.
Felipe Gomez.

87
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:49,889
I know his sister.
He just started dealing to kids.

88
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,058
Where?

89
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:56,362
Opposite direction. Which of
Newton's laws of motion applies?

90
00:04:57,029 --> 00:04:59,599
Police.
Which one of these kids is Enrique?

91
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:05,271
Schoolmates say you've been
flashing thumbnail bags of heroin...

92
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:07,473
...that you got
from some guy named Felipe.

93
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:11,144
- Smack got your tongue, Enrique?
- You got the wrong Enrique.

94
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,113
Really?
Well, let's pat you down then.

95
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:16,182
All right. Up against the
wall, "wrong Enrique."

96
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:18,284
- Can he do that?
- You're in public school, Beaver.

97
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:19,552
You got no rights.

98
00:05:26,425 --> 00:05:29,929
It wasn't just me, man. Felipe was
hanging out by the east gate...

99
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:31,564
...handing them
out to everyone.

100
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:34,500
- Handing them out?
- Giving it away.

101
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,835
Like free samples.

102
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:41,207
I come out to go to work,
and I find my car like this.

103
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:43,376
What do you expect me to do?
This isn't my district.

104
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:45,745
Sir, the widow did this.
She knows where I live.

105
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:49,048
Are you sure it wasn't random?
A prank?

106
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:52,051
You heard her threaten me.
"Justice will find you."

107
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,555
Well, you need to file a report
with Hollywood division.

108
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:57,924
I take those reports.
It's a waste of time.

109
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:00,193
If it's her, you
need to document it.

110
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:02,461
- I guess.
- Look, not to overburden you,...

111
00:06:02,461 --> 00:06:03,663
...but the board's
been on my case...

112
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:05,932
...to get them Julien's
six-month review.

113
00:06:07,099 --> 00:06:09,302
- I'm almost finished with it.
- I need it today.

114
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:14,607
We had officers search every student,
every locker.

115
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:17,376
If they found drugs, I told them
to keep their lockers open.

116
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:28,054
I think you should
start calling some parents.

117
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:45,572
I can't believe
Lem's being such a pussy about this.

118
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,807
Who knows. Maybe he's right.

119
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,676
We don't need him
to pull this off.

120
00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:51,611
Yes, we do.

121
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:53,813
Lem doesn't care
if we ride solo on this thing.

122
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:55,215
Well, I care.

123
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:58,184
Either we're all in, or we're all out.

124
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:05,358
One guy knowing who isn't accountable,
isn't an option.

125
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:07,927
We're a team.
That's the only way it works.

126
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:14,034
My educational reform if middle
schoolers are high on heroin.

127
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:17,737
And if the police can't keep drug
dealers out of our schools...

128
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:19,839
...is there any place
our children can be safe?

129
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,908
Sir, how do you answer
your political opponent's challenge?

130
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:24,344
I'm here as a police officer,
not as a candidate.

131
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:28,348
I want to remedy the situation,
not turn it into political hay.

132
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:29,649
Excuse me.

133
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,486
<i>Jesus, what the hell went down here?</i>

134
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:37,157
Some scumbag was handing out tastes of
heroin like they were goddamn cookies.

135
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:38,258
Heroin?

136
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:42,929
Not your daddy's smack either.
Pure and cheap.

137
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:46,032
Snort it, smoke it, same high as
shooting up without the float...

138
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:47,367
Addictive as shit.

139
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:49,269
You're responsible for drug busts
in this district.

140
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:51,104
I thought you had a
handle on things.

141
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:52,605
I did.

142
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:55,675
Then my handle got burnt
at the stake by Armadillo.

143
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,578
That drug dealer, Tio.

144
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,081
You want to know what my
relationship with him was about?

145
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:03,883
It was about not letting things
like this happen.

146
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:06,219
I gave him slack, but
I gave him rules.

147
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:07,754
He never dealt to kids.

148
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:11,091
With Tio out of the way, somebody else
saw these kids as an untapped market.

149
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:12,692
- So how do we fix this?
- Well...

150
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:15,962
No. No more arrangements
with drug dealers.

151
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,065
Crack down on them...
Publicly and hard.

152
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:21,334
I can do that too.

153
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,009
Police! Get your hands in the air!

154
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,483
<i>- Down! Down! Get down!
</i>- Get down!

155
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:46,259
Word is you think
you can start selling at schools.

156
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:50,397
Turn kids to clients.

157
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:00,940
Nope. No heroin here.

158
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:07,213
Here either, boss.

159
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:10,550
None in here either, boss.

160
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,790
"A," "B," "A," "B,"
"A," "B," "A," "B."

161
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,925
"A," "B," "A," "B," "A."

162
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,361
All the "A's," on your feet.

163
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:25,365
Tell your fellow
Torrucos...

164
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,501
...that the next asshole I
catch selling dope to kids...

165
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:31,371
I'm going to find a soft, dark place
to jam this stick.

166
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:33,706
Now get out.

167
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:36,409
"B's" on your feet.

168
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:41,614
You're all busted!
Felipe, where you going?

169
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,484
You're not an "A."

170
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:47,654
You were handing out samples
at Truman East Middle School today...

171
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:51,157
...which makes you a special
kind of"B"... my bitch.

172
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,861
This guy's probably
going to need a medic.

173
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:56,362
Okay. Call it in.

174
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:59,032
Get the rest of these guys
carred and barred.

175
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:00,800
One-Tango-13,
we need an R.A.

176
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:02,769
Hello, Officer.

177
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,372
- Can I help you?
- You work with a Detective Mackey?

178
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:08,842
Maybe. Why?

179
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:11,044
I sometimes have
information for him.

180
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:14,414
- You one of his C.I.s?
- Not officially.

181
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:16,516
I need to get a message to him.

182
00:10:16,516 --> 00:10:19,252
I lost his number
and, it's important.

183
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:21,221
What's the message?

184
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:24,123
The guy he's looking
for isn't stopping.

185
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:28,828
And I'm afraid if Vic isn't careful,
he might start talking.

186
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:30,697
That's the message?

187
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,068
What's your name?

188
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:40,206
Tell him about the face.
He'll know.

189
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:49,182
Look at you, Felipe.
You barely got hair on your nads...

190
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:51,284
...and you're already dealing
hard stuff to kids.

191
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:53,186
I'm not going to jail.

192
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:56,089
What fantasy world are you living in?

193
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,791
I'm 15. Minors don't get time.

194
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,261
Unless the crime's serious enough.

195
00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:03,596
You moved heavy weights
of "H," amigo.

196
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,732
To hundreds of kids. You're done.

197
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:09,335
- But... But I'm a minor.
- In a major pile of shit.

198
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,771
- But... But I was told that...
- You were told wrong!

199
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:18,745
It's all right. You can cry.
You wouldn't be the first.

200
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,348
And you damn sure
won't be the last.

201
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,153
Everybody's got game on the street.

202
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:32,592
Then you get caught.
Reality sets in.

203
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:34,460
Life as you know it is over.

204
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:38,665
- I was just following orders.
- I know.

205
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:40,466
Go ahead. Let
it all out.

206
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:43,469
You don't understand. You
can't say no to him.

207
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,506
- To who?
- Armadillo.

208
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:50,276
You work for Armadillo?
You've seen him in town?

209
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:52,412
No. Everything goes through Duardo.

210
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:53,546
You know where we
can find Armadillo?

211
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,448
No, but Duardo would.

212
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:57,984
Armadillo's back?

213
00:11:57,984 --> 00:12:00,787
You start kids off for free,
get customers for life.

214
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:02,589
I'm throwing everyone
I have on this.

215
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:04,524
No. You can't do that.

216
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,060
- Why not?
- The last time you couldn't...

217
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,194
...read between the lines...

218
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:10,897
...so this time let me
draw you a clear picture.

219
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:14,434
Keep other cops...
Claudette especially off my ass.

220
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:16,069
What's your plan?

221
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,538
Armadillo knows the law.

222
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:22,609
He's using minors to distribute
because they can't serve major time.

223
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:25,511
He'll also know that they can't
be used as undercover C.I.s...

224
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:27,013
...in a major sting operation.

225
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:28,081
Okay.

226
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,686
I use Felipe as an
undercover informant.

227
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:36,856
He leads us to Duardo.
Duardo leads us to Armadillo.

228
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:38,057
Absolutely not.

229
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:39,592
Are we going to do
this or aren't we?

230
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,495
I'm for doing it in a way that
will actually secure a conviction.

231
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:43,796
It's illegal.

232
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:45,665
My way would be more
of a gray area.

233
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:49,168
The last time we used a kid,
Armadillo raped and tattooed her.

234
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,105
Think of something else,
and do it fast...

235
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:55,141
...or I am putting every unit I got
on tracking him down.

236
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:01,447
Vic.

237
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,749
What can I do for
you, gorgeous?

238
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:04,150
Got a message
for you.

239
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,518
Yes, from who?

240
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:08,021
I guess you know the guy.
Left side of his face was scarred...

241
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:10,156
...like he'd been in some sort
of fire or something.

242
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:13,893
Armadillo's declaring goddamn war.

243
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:16,362
What does he mean,
"You don't want him talking"?

244
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:18,765
Means he's going to explain
the grill marks on his face.

245
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:21,601
Talk about how we were
protecting his drug competition.

246
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:23,136
If somebody else finds
him before us...

247
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,104
Can't happen. We have
to find him first.

248
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:27,807
And what? Hand him
over to Aceveda?

249
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:29,809
He'll pull his gun.

250
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,445
We'll have no choice.

251
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,351
- You see a better way?
- No.

252
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:42,221
Asshole should have gone back
to Mexico like you told him.

253
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,724
What about Lem?

254
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:46,926
He's not down with ripping
off the money train.

255
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:49,228
How the hell you think
he's going to feel about this?

256
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,797
Keep 'im away
from the action.

257
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:52,832
Watching the door or something.
You know the drill.

258
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,102
What's up?

259
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:00,907
What's goin' on?

260
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:03,309
Aceveda wants us
to find Armadillo.

261
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,079
We're just trying to figure out
the best way to do it.

262
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:12,351
My grandfather had Alzheimer's.
I know how hard it is.

263
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,853
I was only
gone an hour.

264
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,122
I mean, the cleaning lady
said she'd watch her.

265
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:17,824
We'll find her. I promise.

266
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:21,594
Is there anyplace where she might go?
People she might visit?

267
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:24,864
No. Most of her friends
have been moved or passed away.

268
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,799
- Any other family members in town?
- No.

269
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,034
I'm her
only child.

270
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,336
Good news is I talked to
the morgue and hospitals.

271
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:32,038
No matches on a Jeannie Sutton.

272
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:36,142
Listen, we've notified
our patrol cars.

273
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:38,444
We're going to distribute a flyer
with your mom's photo.

274
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,413
Someone will find her.

275
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:45,351
Dutch and I will oversee the search
until someone does.

276
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:56,696
- You busy a week from Sunday?
- I don't think so. Why?

277
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:02,802
- Actually, I'm getting married.
- Married? To who?

278
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:03,903
Vanessa.

279
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,838
The mom you've been seeing,
like, for a month?

280
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:07,039
It's been
seven weeks.

281
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,242
Please, tell me
this is a joke.

282
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:12,145
No. I love her.
She loves me.

283
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:14,514
Julien. Jesus.

284
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:17,517
- How goes it?
- Good. Good.

285
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:19,018
I'm getting
married.

286
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:20,787
Holy crap.

287
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:22,255
- Yes.
- Congratulations.

288
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:24,056
- Thanks.
- Better you than me.

289
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:25,424
Yes, that's what I hear.

290
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:30,263
Look, it's going to be
a small ceremony...

291
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,565
...but I really want you to be there.

292
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:33,699
Julien...

293
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,737
- You are gay.
- No. I was misguided.

294
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:39,172
But with the help of God,
I'm now on the right path.

295
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:41,841
I've heard all about
that reorientation crap.

296
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:43,109
It's completely twisted.

297
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,977
That is just
anti-religious propaganda.

298
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:46,145
Julien...

299
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,816
- They are not helping you.
- They are helping me.

300
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:52,752
I just need to know whether or not
you're coming to my wedding.

301
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:56,989
She took three bags
of candy and then what?

302
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:58,925
Then I yelled at her
to stop and pay me.

303
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:00,526
But she was really out of it.

304
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:02,628
You know, like, loco?

305
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,264
I was really worried about her.

306
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:07,066
If you were so worried about her,
why didn't you stop her?

307
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:11,270
I'm going to tackle some old lady?
I called you, didn't I?

308
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:15,708
Yes, I know that store.
My mom used to work there.

309
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,343
- She did?
- Yes. A long time ago.

310
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:18,744
Used to be a
soda shop...

311
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:21,614
...called something else,
but that was her first job.

312
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:23,783
What other things did she do back then?

313
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:26,719
Where've
you been?

314
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:28,421
I felt like a sandwich.

315
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:31,324
Your break was over two hours ago.
We've got a case here.

316
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:35,528
I was hungry. And I wouldn't
exactly call this a case.

317
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:38,631
Jeannie was spotted in a store
she used to work in as a teenager.

318
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:42,101
Now, if she's in a delusional state,
she might be going back into her past.

319
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:43,402
If we do our homework...

320
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:45,905
We're not going
to find her by...

321
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:48,674
...psychoanalyzing the
last 60 years of her life.

322
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,943
God knows how many
defining moments she's had.

323
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,912
You have another
theory, pitch it out.

324
00:16:52,912 --> 00:16:54,380
She's an old, white lady...

325
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,382
...wondering around in a black
and Hispanic neighborhood...

326
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:57,917
...in pajamas and slippers.

327
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,652
Somebody's going
to call her in.

328
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:00,987
Detectives.

329
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:03,522
Someone spotted your woman trying
to get into a locked apartment...

330
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,624
...an hour ago.

331
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:06,926
960 Chester Avenue, number 16.

332
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,562
- See?
- How much you want to bet...

333
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:11,998
...that's a blast from the past?

334
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:18,204
- Excuse me?
- Yes, excuse you.

335
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:21,974
No. You bump into somebody,
show some manners. Apologize.

336
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,678
- That's funny to you?
- Yes.

337
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:28,514
How funny would it be if I knocked
those oversized teeth out?

338
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:32,518
Why don't you back
up, Dutch-boy,...

339
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:35,021
...before you find my boot
print halfway up your ass?

340
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:37,890
We got more important
things to do. Come on.

341
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:40,793
What's the
matter with you?

342
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:43,863
Nothing. Just not going to
take shit from people anymore.

343
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,167
Come on, man.

344
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,002
That's not my lawyer, bro.

345
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,438
Sit down.

346
00:17:58,978 --> 00:18:01,514
Your baby brother's
stupid enough to stay in town.

347
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:04,016
You tell him that
I got some new rules for him.

348
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:06,986
No more dealing to kids.

349
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,888
I don't talk to Armadillo.

350
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:12,692
You can get him word.
Farmington is my house.

351
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:15,194
Nothin' gets dealt there
without my approval.

352
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:19,065
You keep it away
from the kids.

353
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:21,400
There's plenty of
junkies to go around.

354
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,603
Armadillo doesn't like rules.

355
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,772
See that One-niner over there?

356
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:31,811
I've done a few favors for his crew
out on the street.

357
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:34,246
He's willing to pay me back.

358
00:18:35,014 --> 00:18:38,184
One phone call from me
and you're greenlit.

359
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:41,854
- Greenlit?
- It's an American prison term.

360
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:46,025
It means you'll be
shanked in the shower.

361
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:48,995
Bleed out before the guards
even know you're late for breakfast.

362
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,771
You tell Armadillo
about my new rules...

363
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:04,010
...and if he says one thing
about me or my crew...

364
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:06,779
I'll make that call.

365
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,155
You greenlit Navaro?

366
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:18,057
No. I just threatened to.

367
00:19:18,057 --> 00:19:20,493
Greenlighting Navaro's a bluff.
Hopefully...

368
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:23,329
...it'll get him to contact Armadillo,
give us his location.

369
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,698
If Navaro or any of his crew
make a call, the county guards...

370
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:28,000
...will monitor it and
let us listen in.

371
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,669
Ronnie, work on
tracking those calls.

372
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:31,003
I'll wire us up.

373
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:34,473
And if Armadillo's on the other
end, we just bring him in?

374
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:37,210
I mean, what if he talks about,
you know?

375
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:40,279
We're cops. He's a fugitive.
We got a job to do.

376
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:41,581
I don't know, man.

377
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:43,416
Maybe he'll buy this whole
greenlighting thing.

378
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,384
Keep his mouth shut to save his brother.

379
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:49,522
Okay.

380
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:54,293
She was banging on my door.
Jiggling the knob.

381
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:56,963
I opened up, and she just
started yelling, "Who are you?"

382
00:19:57,597 --> 00:19:58,664
This the woman?

383
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:04,804
Crazy. Yes, that's her.

384
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:08,975
She was babbling mostly.
Kept asking about Earl.

385
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:10,142
Earl?

386
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:13,713
Yes. "Where's Earl?"
That's what she said.

387
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:18,818
Earl, you lived in Apartment 16,
960 Chester Avenue?

388
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:20,486
Yes, a long time ago.

389
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:22,788
1946 to 1948?

390
00:20:23,122 --> 00:20:24,490
If you say so.

391
00:20:24,991 --> 00:20:26,859
Do you remember a
Jeannie Sutton?

392
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:28,361
No.

393
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:32,064
What about her maiden name,
Jeannie Russell?

394
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:35,635
Jeannie Russell.
Yes, her I remember.

395
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:38,371
You date her?

396
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:41,307
Yes, for about a year on and off.

397
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,743
Right after the war.

398
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:47,280
I met her at a soda
shop she worked at.

399
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:52,285
- You two keep in touch?
- No, no. I haven't seen her since...

400
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:53,920
I don't know.

401
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,757
But if she still looks as good
as she used to, give her my number.

402
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:01,093
Well, Earl, Jeannie
has Alzheimer's now.

403
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,062
She's lost. We're trying to find her.

404
00:21:03,062 --> 00:21:05,097
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Detective.

405
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,667
We think she might try to contact you.

406
00:21:08,034 --> 00:21:09,669
If she does, would
you give us a call?

407
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:12,672
Absolutely.

408
00:21:12,672 --> 00:21:14,307
A civilian saw one of my flyers.

409
00:21:14,307 --> 00:21:17,009
Called in, said she saw Jeannie
hanging around Echo Park.

410
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,178
Sorry to waste
your time.

411
00:21:20,313 --> 00:21:21,447
Thanks.

412
00:21:22,315 --> 00:21:24,116
This is a C.I. contract.

413
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:26,919
D.A.'s grateful for your school tip.

414
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:30,656
You'll be required
to provide four tips every month.

415
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:32,358
Tips that lead to arrests.

416
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,429
- And I get paid?
- Two thousand a month.

417
00:21:36,996 --> 00:21:38,798
It's not free money, Connie.

418
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:42,501
Four tips every month, and
you got to stay legit.

419
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:44,003
You'll be tested at random.

420
00:21:44,337 --> 00:21:45,671
Why are they going
to test me?

421
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:47,740
Because they care where
their money goes.

422
00:21:49,008 --> 00:21:51,110
- Why, you worried?
- No.

423
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:53,913
I just don't like peeing in a cup
three times a week.

424
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,685
When do I get my check?

425
00:22:00,086 --> 00:22:01,620
As soon as you give us a tip.

426
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:05,124
- I gave you a tip.
- That was in good faith.

427
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,827
Clock starts as soon as you sign.

428
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:20,139
I'll take a look.

429
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:27,880
What happened?

430
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:31,884
A three year old opened a packet
of candy from his brother's backpack.

431
00:22:32,251 --> 00:22:33,819
Except it
wasn't candy.

432
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,122
The free "H"?

433
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:38,891
- Jesus Christ.
- Poor kid.

434
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:41,927
His brother over there
says he got it from school.

435
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:43,763
He's too young to go to Truman East.

436
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:47,733
He doesn't go to Truman East.
He goes to South Torres.

437
00:22:48,501 --> 00:22:51,270
Armadillo's running this shit
through the grade schools too?

438
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:54,407
I'm sick of this. Whatever you're
going to do, do it quick.

439
00:22:54,407 --> 00:22:56,175
- I've already done it.
- Well, do more.

440
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,878
- Yes, like what?
- I don't know. Anything.

441
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:02,448
You can't use Felipe
in an undercover capacity.

442
00:23:02,448 --> 00:23:05,151
Even though he'd lead us
to Armadillo, he's a minor.

443
00:23:06,018 --> 00:23:08,721
And it's illegal to
use a minor as a C.I.

444
00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:10,256
Right.

445
00:23:25,671 --> 00:23:27,640
How'd that two hours in the cage feel?

446
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:32,711
How's 20 years going to feel?

447
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:35,314
I can't go when someone's watching me.

448
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:37,883
You better get used to it.

449
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,454
I'm going to be watching
you for a while.

450
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:43,923
What do you mean?

451
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,826
You're going to do a
good deed, Felipe.

452
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,562
Make the Boys Club proud.

453
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,431
What kind of good deed?

454
00:23:55,201 --> 00:23:58,003
The State of California has a problem
with me using minors undercover...

455
00:23:58,003 --> 00:24:01,140
...so technically,
we're just going to let you go free.

456
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,876
Keep an eye on you
for your own safety.

457
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:05,778
Keep an eye on me?

458
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:09,815
You try to lose us,
you go right back in the can.

459
00:24:10,883 --> 00:24:14,253
You're going to reconnect with Duardo,
find out where Armadillo's hiding.

460
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:23,996
Ma'am, shuffle broad.

461
00:24:25,498 --> 00:24:26,765
Police. Hold it.

462
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:31,670
Who taught you you could
treat an old woman like that?

463
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:35,741
She can't tell. Crawling around,
clawing at the sidewalk.

464
00:24:35,741 --> 00:24:36,942
She's crazy.

465
00:24:38,177 --> 00:24:40,179
Okay, honey.
It's all right.

466
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:42,381
- Get out of here. Go on.
- We'll get you home to your daughter.

467
00:24:42,915 --> 00:24:44,049
You all right?

468
00:24:46,886 --> 00:24:47,987
Got her.

469
00:24:50,723 --> 00:24:51,924
Danny, right?

470
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:56,095
- Hi.
- Vanessa. We met before.

471
00:24:56,629 --> 00:24:57,930
Is Julien around?

472
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,598
He should be
right back.

473
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:02,101
We're going over floral
arrangements for the wedding.

474
00:25:02,101 --> 00:25:04,203
Right. Congratulations.

475
00:25:04,637 --> 00:25:07,072
Thanks.
It's all happening so fast.

476
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:11,477
Yes. Well, Julien's a special guy.

477
00:25:11,477 --> 00:25:13,445
I have never met a man
with such integrity.

478
00:25:14,046 --> 00:25:15,748
He's going to make a great
father for Randall.

479
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:17,883
I'm really lucky.

480
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:20,252
Hi.

481
00:25:27,393 --> 00:25:29,428
- You ready?
- Yes.

482
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:32,598
Julien, can I see you
for a sec first?

483
00:25:33,232 --> 00:25:34,400
I'll meet you at the car.

484
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:40,005
- My God. You haven't told her yet?
- It's not necessary.

485
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:42,041
Julien, she is a single woman
with a child.

486
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:43,976
It's in my past. It
is not important.

487
00:25:43,976 --> 00:25:45,344
She has a right to know.

488
00:25:45,344 --> 00:25:47,046
Every mistake
I've ever made?

489
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:49,882
About something as important as this?
Absolutely.

490
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:51,383
So you tell every man
you've been with...

491
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,519
...about every shameful
thing you've ever done?

492
00:25:57,189 --> 00:25:59,558
You know what? If you don't
tell her before the wedding, I will.

493
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:09,201
What are you going
to do with your cut?

494
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:10,869
What?

495
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:12,638
Your cut. From
the money train.

496
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:16,075
Look, we discuss this
only when we have to.

497
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:18,877
The more we talk about it,
the more chance someone else hears.

498
00:26:21,614 --> 00:26:24,717
- Our fugitive's calling in.
- Yes, I got it.

499
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:33,993
I'm telling you, this money train?
It's a sure thing.

500
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:38,430
Taking mob money. That's not
why I signed up, joined the force.

501
00:26:39,131 --> 00:26:41,700
Goddamn. You get any softer,
you're going to start lactating.

502
00:26:43,135 --> 00:26:44,470
You know, all the stuff
we've been into,...

503
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,805
...there was a reason,
a point to it.

504
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:48,107
Where's the good in this?

505
00:26:48,407 --> 00:26:51,310
Money in our pockets
instead of those Balkan bastards.

506
00:26:52,311 --> 00:26:53,545
I don't know, man.

507
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:57,283
You think I'm doing this for me?

508
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:01,787
Vic's got a sick kid,
tuition payments...

509
00:27:02,321 --> 00:27:04,390
...doctor bills kicking his ass.

510
00:27:06,325 --> 00:27:08,093
I mean,
the guy could be facing a divorce.

511
00:27:09,495 --> 00:27:10,896
He really needs this.

512
00:27:12,865 --> 00:27:15,834
- Heroin in grade school.
- It's awful.

513
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:17,936
I'm going to have to
go on the attack now.

514
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:20,739
Find a way to turn this into votes.

515
00:27:24,777 --> 00:27:26,545
Baby, what's wrong?

516
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:28,781
I don't know how
I got here.

517
00:27:28,781 --> 00:27:31,150
Hard work. Intelligence.

518
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:34,119
- That's not what I meant.
- You'll catch whoever's doing this.

519
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,888
Or Mackey will.

520
00:27:36,455 --> 00:27:37,489
Mackey?

521
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,325
It's his investigation.

522
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:42,127
- Can you trust him?
- No.

523
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:45,664
- Then why?
- It made sense when it started.

524
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:47,966
And now there's so
many loose threads...

525
00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:49,868
To even pull just one...

526
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:54,940
- Christ.
- David. You're going to win.

527
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:59,345
Well, that's what
everyone keeps telling me.

528
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:04,883
And if I don't, I embarrass myself,
embarrass you.

529
00:28:05,117 --> 00:28:09,054
We have a daughter.
The only way you would embarrass me...

530
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:10,622
...was if you weren't doing
everything you could...

531
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:12,891
...to make those schools
as safe as possible.

532
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:13,926
Are you?

533
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:16,962
No.

534
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:20,599
What's stopping you?

535
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,471
I want a wide net. Hit the streets
hard. Check out all the schools.

536
00:28:25,471 --> 00:28:29,408
Grill every kid who got a free sample
and find out where they got it.

537
00:28:29,408 --> 00:28:31,677
Sooner or later,
it's going to lead us to Armadillo.

538
00:28:31,677 --> 00:28:34,480
All right? Talk to all the
gang-bangers who got pushed out...

539
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:39,151
...when the Torrucos consolidated
and call me with anything.

540
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:41,487
All right. Let's go.

541
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:45,691
Armadillo's in town?

542
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:48,627
Yes. He's the one
dealing drugs in the schools.

543
00:28:48,627 --> 00:28:51,430
- And you didn't tell me?
- I just found out.

544
00:28:52,331 --> 00:28:55,567
- I need to talk to him.
- I know.

545
00:28:56,535 --> 00:28:59,171
And as soon as I find him,
you'll get first shot.

546
00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:01,006
And you and Mackey won't interfere?

547
00:29:01,607 --> 00:29:03,175
No one will get in your way.

548
00:29:10,015 --> 00:29:13,719
We'll give you a head start. You go in
and ask for a new batch of samples.

549
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,287
Phone.

550
00:29:19,024 --> 00:29:21,026
I'll call you
10 minutes after you're in.

551
00:29:21,026 --> 00:29:24,730
If the drugs are visible,
you pick up and say something clever.

552
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:27,032
If you don't answer,
I'll know they're not out.

553
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:29,134
I'll keep calling
until you pick up.

554
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:30,235
Then what?

555
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:34,039
We'll make a little house call.
Pick up you and your buddies.

556
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:37,109
Once we get you back to the barn, we
cut you loose because you're a minor.

557
00:29:37,676 --> 00:29:39,645
No one knows we had this
little arrangement.

558
00:29:41,046 --> 00:29:42,080
Okay.

559
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,787
- Cheers, little "G."
- Cheers.

560
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:56,128
- Thirsty?
- Yes, I guess so.

561
00:29:58,597 --> 00:30:00,466
I got some kids asking
for more of that stuff.

562
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:02,000
I guess they like that shit.

563
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:04,303
All right, all right.

564
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:13,645
Cost them 20 now. Got that?

565
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,314
- Yes, Yes. I got it.
- All right.

566
00:30:15,848 --> 00:30:17,483
Give him something
to carry this with, man.

567
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:30,095
What, bitch?
I told you not to call me.

568
00:30:31,864 --> 00:30:34,132
Little "G" settin' the
ho's straight already.

569
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:35,200
Yes.

570
00:30:52,618 --> 00:30:53,919
What's the matter, dog?

571
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,488
That's what I want to know.
Let's see who called you.

572
00:30:57,289 --> 00:30:59,157
Get down!
Down on the ground. Down!

573
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:00,325
Stay down!

574
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:14,039
- You're dead.
- Shut up!

575
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:19,545
- You okay?
- No. I'm dead.

576
00:31:25,918 --> 00:31:27,153
You wanted to see me?

577
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,155
Yes. Close the door, please.

578
00:31:35,194 --> 00:31:38,064
- I just got a call from the police.
- About my car?

579
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:41,500
Sit down, Danny.

580
00:31:46,172 --> 00:31:47,340
What?

581
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:50,543
The call was from Maryland.
Your mother died.

582
00:31:50,543 --> 00:31:52,011
A car accident.

583
00:31:53,312 --> 00:31:54,380
What?

584
00:31:55,047 --> 00:31:56,215
I'm so sorry.

585
00:31:58,918 --> 00:32:02,388
- Can I call my dad?
- Yes. I'll be outside.

586
00:32:15,935 --> 00:32:18,938
Dad. It's me.

587
00:32:19,772 --> 00:32:23,075
It was a goddamn prank.
It was a prank. My mother's fine.

588
00:32:23,075 --> 00:32:25,378
- Slow down. What?
- I want her records subpoenaed.

589
00:32:25,378 --> 00:32:26,913
We have to prove that she
made that phone call.

590
00:32:26,913 --> 00:32:28,881
- Danny, stop.
- I want a cop tailing her.

591
00:32:28,881 --> 00:32:30,883
- Just calm down.
- She destroys my car...

592
00:32:30,883 --> 00:32:33,586
...and then she tries to ruin
my career. Now it's my family.

593
00:32:33,586 --> 00:32:37,023
Okay. All right. We'll take care
of this. I'll take care of this.

594
00:32:39,859 --> 00:32:42,261
- The doctor said she can go home now.
- Great.

595
00:32:42,862 --> 00:32:45,898
- Thank you for all you did.
- Anne, hold on a second.

596
00:32:46,299 --> 00:32:49,602
Your mom must have been 17, 18
when she dated Earl?

597
00:32:50,236 --> 00:32:52,138
Pretty conservative times back then.

598
00:32:52,138 --> 00:32:54,006
- Excuse me?
- Dutch.

599
00:32:54,006 --> 00:32:57,143
You said she was going back
into her past. I didn't believe you.

600
00:32:57,143 --> 00:32:59,979
But then Jeannie went back
to the store she used to work at...

601
00:33:00,413 --> 00:33:02,748
...an apartment
where her old boyfriend lived.

602
00:33:02,748 --> 00:33:06,452
So why go back to a piece
of sidewalk in Echo Park?

603
00:33:06,452 --> 00:33:07,586
Why?

604
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:09,088
According to the L.A.
Times archives...

605
00:33:09,088 --> 00:33:11,357
...a newborn baby was found
smothered to death...

606
00:33:11,357 --> 00:33:14,360
...in that park, November 18, 1947.

607
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,861
Buried in a shallow grave.

608
00:33:17,063 --> 00:33:18,831
You want to know
where that grave was located?

609
00:33:20,132 --> 00:33:23,035
Right where your mother sat today,
clawing at the asphalt.

610
00:33:23,903 --> 00:33:26,405
They built a sidewalk over the garden.

611
00:33:26,706 --> 00:33:28,808
Three blocks from
Earl's old apartment.

612
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:31,978
No.

613
00:33:33,379 --> 00:33:34,714
That's
impossible.

614
00:33:35,181 --> 00:33:37,850
Someone in there helped kill
a baby boy, didn't they?

615
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:44,423
I'm not even going to
waste my time with you.

616
00:33:44,423 --> 00:33:47,493
You're running Armadillo's drugs
through the schools. Where is he?

617
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,261
Arma who?

618
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:55,368
Tell me. Tell me.

619
00:33:55,368 --> 00:33:56,435
<i>Vic!</i>

620
00:33:58,904 --> 00:34:01,540
<i>Vic, open this door.</i>

621
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:02,908
You ready?

622
00:34:05,711 --> 00:34:08,214
- What's going on?
- I'm interrogating the suspect.

623
00:34:09,081 --> 00:34:11,851
Duardo here runs the drugs
through the schools.

624
00:34:11,851 --> 00:34:14,520
- Isn't that right?
- I'm taking him back to the barn.

625
00:34:15,321 --> 00:34:16,522
I'm not done.

626
00:34:16,522 --> 00:34:18,391
I'm taking him with me.
Hand him over.

627
00:34:18,791 --> 00:34:19,925
Come here.

628
00:34:25,331 --> 00:34:29,101
You gave me the green light
to get Armadillo. I'm one step away.

629
00:34:29,101 --> 00:34:31,604
I'm a little uncomfortable
with the steps you're now taking.

630
00:34:31,604 --> 00:34:34,373
I saw the underage C.I. outside.
His cover's been blown?

631
00:34:34,373 --> 00:34:36,075
We both knew that was a risk.

632
00:34:36,642 --> 00:34:38,411
You've done a good job
getting this far.

633
00:34:38,411 --> 00:34:39,912
I just need to
take it from here.

634
00:34:39,912 --> 00:34:42,415
- You want Armadillo or not?
- I do.

635
00:34:43,049 --> 00:34:45,484
- And Claudette and I will get him.
- Claudette?

636
00:34:45,484 --> 00:34:48,354
She overheard.
There's nothing I can do about it.

637
00:34:49,055 --> 00:34:50,923
We've got to do it by the book now.

638
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:55,027
Shane, put him in my car.

639
00:35:06,005 --> 00:35:10,376
I spoke to Aceveda. He said I
passed my performance review.

640
00:35:11,043 --> 00:35:12,445
You deserve to.

641
00:35:12,445 --> 00:35:13,879
He also said I had
communication...

642
00:35:13,879 --> 00:35:15,815
...and stress management
issues that need addressing.

643
00:35:15,815 --> 00:35:17,383
Look, you passed.
Okay?

644
00:35:18,084 --> 00:35:20,119
This is because I didn't
cover you on that shooting.

645
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:21,754
You still think
I'm holding that over you?

646
00:35:21,754 --> 00:35:24,056
Or maybe it's because
I'm getting married.

647
00:35:24,056 --> 00:35:25,391
It's because it's the truth.

648
00:35:25,391 --> 00:35:27,159
Look, I think it's
about something else.

649
00:35:27,493 --> 00:35:28,627
Maybe it's because
somebody's...

650
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:30,563
...messing with your car or
they called on your mom...

651
00:35:30,563 --> 00:35:32,198
...and you're going
to take it out on me?

652
00:35:32,198 --> 00:35:34,066
You are way past out of line.

653
00:35:34,066 --> 00:35:38,003
I deserved higher marks on that.
That... That review goes on my jacket.

654
00:35:38,003 --> 00:35:40,673
Truth is, Julien, I could've been
a whole lot tougher on you.

655
00:35:41,006 --> 00:35:43,642
Your inability to communicate
is a serious problem.

656
00:35:44,243 --> 00:35:46,946
You have this bottled-up pressure
because of your personal life...

657
00:35:46,946 --> 00:35:48,414
...and no release valve.

658
00:35:50,716 --> 00:35:52,184
Things I've
seen...

659
00:35:53,185 --> 00:35:55,154
Your review could have
been a lot worse.

660
00:35:56,188 --> 00:35:58,324
I thought about
what you said about Vanessa.

661
00:35:59,492 --> 00:36:00,626
Good.

662
00:36:00,626 --> 00:36:02,194
I'm not going to jeopardize
the only good relationship...

663
00:36:02,194 --> 00:36:05,764
...I've ever had because of something
I'm not and will never be again.

664
00:36:05,764 --> 00:36:09,135
If you want to tell her, fine.
That's on your conscience.

665
00:36:12,505 --> 00:36:15,808
We found the heroin, your little
sample bags. We establish the ties...

666
00:36:15,808 --> 00:36:17,676
...to the schools, and you're
sure to get the death penalty...

667
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:19,011
...for that little boy.

668
00:36:19,011 --> 00:36:21,647
The only way to avoid it
is to give us Armadillo.

669
00:36:22,581 --> 00:36:24,550
He's your boss, right? Your supplier?

670
00:36:25,351 --> 00:36:26,752
How does he contact you?

671
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,761
Where is he?

672
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:51,510
- What's up?
- I got something for you.

673
00:36:52,511 --> 00:36:55,414
This pimp's getting his girls
to roll johns in an alley off Western.

674
00:36:55,781 --> 00:36:57,016
Okay, we'll
check into it.

675
00:36:57,016 --> 00:36:59,752
But, tips like this you
can give over the phone.

676
00:36:59,752 --> 00:37:01,220
Okay. Vic.

677
00:37:03,355 --> 00:37:07,526
I really need to know where Brian is.
I need to see my son.

678
00:37:17,169 --> 00:37:20,005
Connie, you can't.

679
00:37:20,005 --> 00:37:21,674
I want him
back, Vic.

680
00:37:22,308 --> 00:37:24,476
I'm clean. I've
got a job now.

681
00:37:25,044 --> 00:37:26,946
He's with a new family.

682
00:37:28,214 --> 00:37:29,615
You signed him over.

683
00:37:33,219 --> 00:37:34,553
I was high then.

684
00:37:34,853 --> 00:37:36,388
That's why you gave him up.

685
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:41,360
No. No.

686
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:44,964
I gave him to you
to take care of him for me.

687
00:37:47,233 --> 00:37:50,302
You knew I'd get clean.
You saw how hard I was trying.

688
00:37:52,338 --> 00:37:56,175
You don't know what this is like
to lose your kid.

689
00:37:59,111 --> 00:38:00,312
Please, Vic.

690
00:38:03,449 --> 00:38:07,286
Brian's gone.
You have to accept that.

691
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:13,325
Okay.

692
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:21,734
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry too.

693
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:28,507
That tip I just gave you?
I need a cash advance.

694
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,921
Thanks.

695
00:38:57,703 --> 00:38:59,371
Navaro make any calls yet?

696
00:38:59,371 --> 00:39:01,440
- Nope.
- They get Duardo to roll?

697
00:39:02,341 --> 00:39:05,277
I don't know. I'll be back.

698
00:39:13,252 --> 00:39:14,787
- Carlton.
- What's up, Vic?

699
00:39:16,689 --> 00:39:20,059
See this guy?
He's with the Lancaster Gang Unit.

700
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:23,195
He got you a spot
on their Clean Slate program.

701
00:39:24,363 --> 00:39:26,732
- Is that like juvie?
- It's better.

702
00:39:27,366 --> 00:39:31,337
Get rid of the ink, balls'll drop,
come back in a couple years a new man.

703
00:39:31,337 --> 00:39:32,838
No one will even recognize you.

704
00:39:35,741 --> 00:39:37,843
I had to pull a lot of favors
to get this to happen.

705
00:39:39,078 --> 00:39:41,480
- Okay.
- Well, I'm waiting.

706
00:39:42,214 --> 00:39:44,883
- Thank you.
- Go.

707
00:39:48,687 --> 00:39:50,522
You killed your baby,
didn't you, Earl?

708
00:39:51,123 --> 00:39:52,224
You and Jeannie.

709
00:39:56,161 --> 00:39:57,529
"Baby Boy Doe...

710
00:39:57,529 --> 00:40:01,133
...buried in the unidentified grave
section of the L.A. County Cemetery."

711
00:40:04,536 --> 00:40:08,574
We're going to dig him up, Earl,
get your D.N.A. ...

712
00:40:09,675 --> 00:40:11,310
...prove you were his father.

713
00:40:15,314 --> 00:40:19,151
You really think Armadillo's
going to reward you for your loyalty?

714
00:40:19,151 --> 00:40:21,620
When we bust him, he's going
to think it's because of you.

715
00:40:22,354 --> 00:40:23,956
He's got a lot of friends inside.

716
00:40:24,957 --> 00:40:27,493
You're going to end up
burned to death in your cell.

717
00:40:28,627 --> 00:40:32,364
And we're going to get him. All you
guys think you're so brilliant.

718
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,901
We got you, didn't we?

719
00:40:38,537 --> 00:40:40,739
What happens if I
tell you where he is?

720
00:40:40,739 --> 00:40:43,642
We'll make sure you're safe and sound
in Ossining, New York.

721
00:40:45,411 --> 00:40:47,346
I can only tell you
where he's been staying lately.

722
00:40:53,018 --> 00:40:54,987
- What's up?
- Duardo gave us Armadillo.

723
00:40:54,987 --> 00:40:56,355
He's at a place in Inglewood.

724
00:40:56,355 --> 00:40:58,123
- Great. I'll go get my guys.
- Not necessary.

725
00:40:58,123 --> 00:41:00,192
- SWAT's already on their way there.
- SWAT?

726
00:41:00,192 --> 00:41:03,328
I'll let you see him as soon as we
bring him in. All right, let's go.

727
00:41:03,929 --> 00:41:04,930
<i>Vic.</i>

728
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,302
Hi. What's up?

729
00:41:10,903 --> 00:41:13,572
I was thinking that we
could get together tonight.

730
00:41:13,572 --> 00:41:15,641
I can't do it tonight.
Rain check?

731
00:41:19,645 --> 00:41:21,013
Name the time and the place.

732
00:41:22,281 --> 00:41:24,616
You know, I don't think
that I can do this anymore.

733
00:41:25,384 --> 00:41:27,352
Sure you can.
Just another time.

734
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:33,659
No, you know what? This isn't working
for me the way that it used to.

735
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,094
I got to get out of here.

736
00:41:40,365 --> 00:41:43,702
You're wrong, Detective.
You don't know my mother.

737
00:41:44,937 --> 00:41:47,005
I just wish you had a chance
to know your brother.

738
00:41:55,481 --> 00:41:57,182
Should I be worried about you?

739
00:41:57,583 --> 00:41:58,784
Not about me.

740
00:41:59,852 --> 00:42:01,753
Maybe about the rest of humanity.

741
00:42:02,087 --> 00:42:06,291
Bunch of sociopathic
little narcissists out for ourselves.

742
00:42:06,792 --> 00:42:11,763
Begging, stealing,
lying, screwing, raping.

743
00:42:12,164 --> 00:42:13,699
Killing our babies.

744
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:18,070
Whatever it takes to have a good time
and save our own asses.

745
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:22,841
I can't even believe in an old woman
who's too sick to feed herself.

746
00:42:23,909 --> 00:42:28,146
And it's not sad. It's not some
big surprise. It's just nature.

747
00:42:29,147 --> 00:42:30,983
We're animals.
Nothing more.

748
00:42:32,017 --> 00:42:33,385
And you know what?

749
00:42:35,554 --> 00:42:37,456
I'm learning to be okay with that.

750
00:42:47,165 --> 00:42:49,234
- Navaro's on the phone?
- Less than a minute.

751
00:42:49,668 --> 00:42:52,037
Prison switchboard confirms
he's talking to Armadillo.

752
00:42:52,037 --> 00:42:53,272
Give me the number.

753
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,976
This is 323.
Aceveda's going to Inglewood.

754
00:42:57,976 --> 00:42:59,111
That's 310.

755
00:42:59,111 --> 00:43:01,613
He's got the wrong address.
Go get the right one, quick.

756
00:43:03,515 --> 00:43:05,751
- What's he saying?
- Armadillo's asking him...

757
00:43:05,751 --> 00:43:07,119
...something in Spanish.

758
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:10,522
- Something about a lawyer.
- Vic.

759
00:43:13,225 --> 00:43:16,228
- What?
- We can't bring him in alive.

760
00:43:16,228 --> 00:43:17,996
Armadillo. We can't
bring him in alive.

761
00:43:18,363 --> 00:43:19,998
- Why is that?
- If we take him in,...

762
00:43:19,998 --> 00:43:21,867
...the only thing he
has to deal is us.

763
00:43:22,367 --> 00:43:25,103
Look, I don't like it,
but this bastard has to go, Vic.

764
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:27,673
Jail won't slow him down. You
tried reasoning with him.

765
00:43:27,673 --> 00:43:28,807
I'm not going to lose my job...

766
00:43:28,807 --> 00:43:30,475
...so some kid-raping
piece of shit can...

767
00:43:30,475 --> 00:43:32,878
...bargain down his sentence,
make me his bunk-mate.

768
00:43:35,814 --> 00:43:38,317
- You talk to Shane about this?
- No, but I can.

769
00:43:39,217 --> 00:43:41,687
- 3938 Bonita Vista.
- Okay, let's go.

770
00:43:42,087 --> 00:43:45,057
Ronnie, stay on the line.
Call us with anything we need.

771
00:43:45,757 --> 00:43:46,959
Lem, you drive.

772
00:43:47,225 --> 00:43:48,727
Shouldn't we be taking two cars?

773
00:43:48,727 --> 00:43:51,330
- No, we're good.
- Yes?

774
00:44:04,009 --> 00:44:06,111
Armadillo's
still on the phone with his bro.

775
00:44:07,879 --> 00:44:10,649
First guy who gets
a good shot takes it. Go.

776
00:44:55,861 --> 00:44:59,097
- Nothing.
- Goddamn it.

777
00:44:59,831 --> 00:45:02,034
- Think somebody tipped him off?
- Who?

778
00:45:02,401 --> 00:45:03,502
I don't know.

779
00:45:08,573 --> 00:45:11,009
- <i>Yes?
</i>- I hope you all made it.

780
00:45:15,547 --> 00:45:17,816
Weren't you supposed to
meet me here to suck my xxxx?

781
00:45:18,116 --> 00:45:21,186
I wanted to speak to you
one last time.

782
00:45:21,386 --> 00:45:24,423
You better talk to your brother
before you start making death threats.

783
00:45:24,423 --> 00:45:26,625
I've already taken care of my brother.

784
00:45:31,129 --> 00:45:35,067
And now you've been greenlit.
