1
00:00:00,767 --> 00:00:02,101
<i>Previously on The Shield.</i>

2
00:00:03,403 --> 00:00:04,671
Armadillo Quintero?

3
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:07,474
You're not here to fight the
Torros and the Los Mags.

4
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:08,808
You're here to unite 'em.

5
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:12,045
Pack up your shit and get on the next
donkey back to home.

6
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:13,847
I want to be staying for a while?

7
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,081
I asked you to leave.

8
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:18,451
I don't have to leave.

9
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:19,719
Tell me you're
leaving.

10
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:24,457
The more I look into it,
the more Vic Mackey's name pops up.

11
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:26,292
Means he's going to explain
the grill marks on his face.

12
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:28,895
Talk about how we were
protecting his drug competition.

13
00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:31,498
When were you planning on telling me
about Armadillo's death threat?

14
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:33,633
It's just talk. Nothing ever happens.

15
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:34,767
Where the hell were you?

16
00:00:34,767 --> 00:00:36,569
I thought I was being followed
by some Mexican.

17
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:38,471
- One of Armadillos's boys?
- Maybe.

18
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:39,939
- What's up?
- I need you to put guys...

19
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:41,808
...on my wife and kids 24/7.

20
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:43,543
Armadillo. We can't
bring him in alive.

21
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,812
If we take him in, the
only thing he has to deal is us.

22
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:47,947
I don't like it, but this
bastard has to go, Vic.

23
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:49,182
Armadillo's in town?

24
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:50,450
I need to talk to him.

25
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,151
As soon as I find him,
you'll get first shot.

26
00:00:52,151 --> 00:00:53,987
And you and Mackey won't interfere?

27
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:55,121
No one will get in your way.

28
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:57,524
- Wife?
- Separated.

29
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,295
My god! What's that smell?

30
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,703
- Ronnie?
- My god!

31
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:12,038
Call an ambulance!

32
00:01:16,075 --> 00:01:19,646
Ronnie. Ronnie. Ronnie?

33
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:20,780
Armadillo?

34
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,650
<i>Armadillo, right?</i>

35
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:26,953
No, no, no. Don't move, Ronnie.
They're comin'

36
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,489
All right, here you go.

37
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:33,092
You're going to be okay, Ronnie.

38
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:34,794
<i>Right.</i>

39
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:44,337
<i>Don't move, buddy.</i>

40
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,311
- Take care of him, will ya?
- Yes. Yeah.

41
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:53,646
- We're going to fix this, brother.
- Hang in, man.

42
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:03,823
I'm sorry about your guy.

43
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,858
This was Armadillo, wasn't it?

44
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,734
<i>Are you staying at the hotel?</i>

45
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:18,338
No. Vic and I were discussing
a domestic abuse case.

46
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:19,505
She's only been
here a few minutes.

47
00:02:19,505 --> 00:02:21,407
There's nothing she can
tell you that I can't.

48
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:23,876
- Give me a call if you need anything.
- I will.

49
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,049
Jesus.

50
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,219
What is it with this guy
and burning?

51
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:37,957
First, traces of flesh
on the stove burners at his house.

52
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:39,826
Now this.

53
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,162
Armadillo was looking for you.

54
00:02:43,896 --> 00:02:46,899
- I know.
- Trust me. One of ours?

55
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:49,736
I'm going to help you
take care of it.

56
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:55,041
Claudette, don't take this
the wrong way...

57
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:57,510
...but I don't need your help.

58
00:03:01,914 --> 00:03:03,449
We got to find Armadillo
before somebody...

59
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:05,084
...matches his face
up to Ronnie's.

60
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:06,552
How you want to handle this?

61
00:03:06,552 --> 00:03:08,087
The way we should've weeks ago.

62
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:11,190
Flush out every shithole in the
barrio until we find this prick.

63
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,292
- Sounds like a plan.
- Then we end it.

64
00:03:13,292 --> 00:03:14,560
Once and for all.

65
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:20,900
- Vic.
- No speeches.

66
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,102
Armadillo burned my guy.
I'm gettin' him.

67
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:25,271
I just talked to the hospital.

68
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:28,341
Looks like they're going to be able
to graft most of Ronnie's face.

69
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:31,744
Thanks.

70
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:35,348
I'm going to contact
Justice,...

71
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:36,949
...bring in a surveillance
team to watch your back.

72
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:39,519
- You want to baby-sit us?
- No, I just want to keep you alive.

73
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,320
We can take care of ourselves.

74
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:44,557
The last thing either one of us needs
is the feds thinking that we can't.

75
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,959
Just let us do what we do, sir.

76
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,362
You didn't see Ronnie.

77
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:53,399
I can imagine.

78
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:55,902
Okay.

79
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,717
All right, pull 15, 20 grand
from the retirement fund.

80
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:13,086
We're going to need to grease some
greasers to get to Armadillo.

81
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,054
Does this mean you're
giving us back our keys?

82
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:17,790
We won't let you down.

83
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:44,151
I went to see Ronnie.
He made a preliminary statement.

84
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:46,286
It's enough to put an
all-points out for Armadillo.

85
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,320
Good.

86
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:52,459
- Where's Mackey?
- He's trying to flush out Armadillo.

87
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,294
You turned him loose on this guy?

88
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,696
One of his guys was maimed last night.
He wants to be involved.

89
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:59,499
I know he's involved.
How involved are you?

90
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:00,901
- Excuse me?
- With Mackey.

91
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:03,904
I see what's in it for him.
What's in it for you?

92
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:06,706
Stop looking for conspiracies
that don't exist.

93
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,109
Just investigate Ronnie's attack.

94
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:17,751
You're taking T&A
to a whole new level, Van Bro.

95
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:20,720
Inner-city realism wasn't sellin'.
People like to be titillated.

96
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:23,924
- Ain't that the truth.
- What you need, Mackey?

97
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:27,994
- One of my guys got hurt last night.
- Damn. Dangerous times, man.

98
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,263
- Who did it?
- Armadillo.

99
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:32,599
I been hearin' some impressive things
about that Mexican.

100
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:33,833
Impressive how?

101
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,902
Word is he don't trust L.A. talent.

102
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:39,606
He's shipping his own folks
from Mexico City to run the consolidation.

103
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:41,374
Some smart-ass C.E.O.

104
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:45,612
Here. I want you to spread this around
and spread the word.

105
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,548
I'm willing to pay for info
on Armadillo.

106
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:50,350
All I need's a location.

107
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,553
I'll do my thing, baby.

108
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:54,754
You do that.

109
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:56,856
Ready for the big day?

110
00:05:56,856 --> 00:06:01,027
Yes. I picked up the rings this
morning. I'm glad you're coming.

111
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,362
Wouldn't miss it.

112
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:04,898
Julien.

113
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:07,968
I just wanted to tell you
in front of your training officer...

114
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:10,070
...that, based on your
six-month review...

115
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:12,239
...and your performance lately...

116
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:15,475
I've put your name in
for a P-2 promotion.

117
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:16,643
Really?

118
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,613
- Thank you.
- Good work.

119
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,448
Keep it up.

120
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,052
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

121
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:29,789
I'm just feeling
so blessed right now.

122
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:33,493
I got a great job,
a wonderful wife, a new son.

123
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:36,263
I just feel like God is
really looking out for me now.

124
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:39,966
If you ever meet someone, you'll
know exactly what I'm talking about.

125
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:47,173
- This way. Hurry.
- What is it, sir?

126
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:51,678
Christ.

127
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:54,080
<i>No, no, no. Don't touch him.</i>

128
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,117
One-Tango-13 requesting paramedics,
code three.

129
00:06:57,117 --> 00:06:59,052
<i>Copy, One-Tango-13.</i>

130
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:01,154
One-Tango-13, additional
units requested.

131
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:02,322
<i>Copy that.</i>

132
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,157
What do you got?

133
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:06,326
Little Pop, Los Mags O.G.

134
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,228
Just got out of Pelican Bay
last week...

135
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:09,462
...and he is not happy about...

136
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:11,364
...Armadillo's power
restructuring neither.

137
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:14,901
You got the bone. He's got the pick.

138
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:22,742
Welcome home, Little Pop.

139
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,980
I hear you're having some problems
with your Torruco brothers.

140
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:29,783
I had it good inside.

141
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,853
I was movin' drugs, smokes,
a little gambling.

142
00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:36,423
I made enough to keep my mom
straight out here.

143
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,625
Armadillo moves into Pelican Bay.

144
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,561
I take his ink,
kick him back his cut...

145
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:44,197
...and then he promises me
a piece out here.

146
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:46,866
So I took my parole...

147
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,668
...come on home.

148
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:50,070
Armadillo had a change of heart.

149
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,973
That choco. He brings up these real
Mexicans from M.C. to run things.

150
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:57,644
Suddenly I'm a goddamn wetback
in my own country.

151
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:00,447
Errand boy, getting beers
for these pendejos.

152
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:02,015
No money, no respect.

153
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:09,022
I ain't got nothin' out here...

154
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:12,225
...and I'm too old to start over.

155
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:16,229
I got to get me back inside.

156
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,868
It's going to take me months
to get back the respect...

157
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:23,203
...and the juice that I had.

158
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,439
I sympathize with your situation.

159
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:29,743
What can you tell me?

160
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:35,348
There's this wiry vato named Quazi,
works out of the back of his garage.

161
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:38,551
He's Armadillo's personal paper boy
from down south.

162
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:41,788
Prints his visas, his green cards.

163
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,859
You get him. You get Armadillo.

164
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:49,996
Thanks.

165
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:56,936
Jail's too good for him.

166
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:13,119
You fillin' out back orders
for Ellis Island, Quazi?

167
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:16,122
Where's Armadillo?

168
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:32,906
- Put your hand in here.
- Que?

169
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:37,177
Do it.

170
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:43,016
No, no, no!

171
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:44,884
Where's Armadillo?

172
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:49,088
(Foreign language)

173
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:54,027
(Foreign language)

174
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:56,629
Well?

175
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,865
He says he's in some house
in the Little Jewel.

176
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:03,837
We need an address, amigo.

177
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:06,773
This was a message, not a mugging.

178
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:09,742
Tell me about it. They left the
wallet, a watch, 50 bucks.

179
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:11,177
Witnesses?

180
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:15,181
That guy saw an Asian teenaged male
running down the alleyway...

181
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:16,616
...into the back parking lot.

182
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:19,853
Red hooded sweatshirt,
black pants, tennis shoes.

183
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:22,722
- What about the victim?
- His name's Lee Kusa.

184
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:25,325
He's Thai national. He's legal.

185
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:29,395
Doesn't sound like a gang thing.

186
00:10:29,596 --> 00:10:31,264
Wasn't a robbery. It's weird.

187
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,903
Cameras. Find out who they belong to,
whether or not they're working.

188
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:38,271
You'd better hurry. The
cheap places... ...

189
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:40,173
...only have them on a
one or two-hour loop.

190
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:04,531
Get your ass down. Down!

191
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:06,766
- It's okay.
- On the ground!

192
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,278
Shit! Holy shit!

193
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,514
Holy shit!

194
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,487
- You all right, man?
- Crazy bitch!

195
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:31,524
- Jesus, man!
- What?

196
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,059
Jesus God!

197
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:37,797
Forget the dog.
Let's go talk to the soldiers.

198
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:39,532
Let's go.

199
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:43,169
Caught the guy on camera
getting into his car. Ran the D.M.V.

200
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,905
Got a 19-year-old Asian.
Lives here.

201
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:48,508
- Great.
- Everybody be careful.

202
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:54,447
Trust me, it's not always this easy.

203
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:07,393
Yes?

204
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:12,599
Detective Wagenbach.
We're looking for a Malcolm Rama.

205
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:14,968
He in shower, cleaning up.

206
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:18,538
- Where's Armadillo?
- Nosanada

207
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:21,407
- Nosanada? Go.
- All right.

208
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:32,552
Same thing for you, Juanita.
Get up. Get up!

209
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:35,054
Where's your boss?

210
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:37,657
- Nosanada.
- Same wrong answer.

211
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:39,158
All right, that's it. You ready?

212
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,863
- He doesn't know anything.
- We're just trying to jar his memory.

213
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:45,398
Bring 'em back to the barn.

214
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:50,303
You're lucky.

215
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,441
I'm looking for Vic.

216
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:58,478
Foster. He's not here.

217
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,414
I tried calling him.
He's not answering his cell.

218
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:03,950
He's out making some arrests.
Probably turned it off.

219
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:06,719
Is there something
I can help you with?

220
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:09,222
- Someone broke into our house.
- When?

221
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:10,556
This morning.

222
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:13,559
I was dropping Matthew off
at the occupational therapist's...

223
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:17,096
...and when I came home,
the police were there.

224
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:20,099
They broke the window,
and they set off the alarm.

225
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,602
It might have something
to what's going on here.

226
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:23,870
What's going on?

227
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:27,040
Come on. Let's talk in private.

228
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:30,009
Paula. You ever do any baby-sitting?

229
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,344
I work here, don't I?

230
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:32,512
What's going on?

231
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:35,815
Someone burned off half of
Ronnie Gardocki's face.

232
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:39,485
- What? Ronnie?
- In your husband's motel room.

233
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,722
We think they were targeting him.

234
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:45,658
- Why would somebody want to...
- Didn't Vic tell you?

235
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:48,528
That Armadillo was
greenlighting his team?

236
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:50,430
Who's Armadillo?

237
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:55,034
You know, maybe it'd be easier...

238
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:57,603
...if you answered
some of my questions first.

239
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:00,106
Okay.

240
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:08,414
I talked to Aceveda. He said I can snag you
for a few hours to help with my case,...

241
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:09,615
...if you're interested.

242
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:11,050
- Yes.
- Great.

243
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:14,020
Heard about your promotion snafu.

244
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,022
- Sorry.
- Thanks.

245
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,224
Maybe I can steer you
toward detective work.

246
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:19,759
You seem to have a knack for it.

247
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,230
Where were you this morning
at 10:40, Malcolm?

248
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:27,066
Russell Park. I run there.

249
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:31,471
You happen to step into a puddle
of human blood at the park, Malcolm?

250
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:33,439
You're making a mistake.

251
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:38,611
Maybe you didn't set out
to hurt the guy, but he's in a coma.

252
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:43,216
Did he disrespect you?
You dating his daughter? What?

253
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,251
You're going to jail
for this...

254
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:46,352
...whether you confess
or not...

255
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:52,325
...so for our own morbid curiosity,
you know, why'd you do it?

256
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:53,626
I didn't.

257
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,099
- We've got a problem.
- What?

258
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:01,667
- He could walk.
- Come on.

259
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:03,803
The bloody clothes?
The videotape?

260
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:05,438
You know how
many hours...

261
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:08,107
...the average juror spends
watching soap operas every week?

262
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:09,642
I don't know. Four?

263
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:11,344
17.8.

264
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:13,312
Per week.

265
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:16,315
Jurors like simple stories
they can understand.

266
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:17,416
He did it. We caught him.

267
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,986
- Doesn't get simpler than that.
- But why did he do it?

268
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:22,889
Unless he confesses,
at trial we'll be expected to know.

269
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,424
The victim's blood runs straight
out of that kid's car...

270
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,526
...right up to the front door.

271
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:30,229
Maybe the jury figures we planted it,
sets this guy free to caddy for O.J.

272
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:31,330
But he did it.

273
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,567
Until you know why, a
detective's job isn't done.

274
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:39,205
- How long has Vic been in the motel?
- A few weeks.

275
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:41,107
We're spending some time apart.

276
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:47,580
I thought maybe he was trying to
make it safer for you and the kids.

277
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,952
Does he have a post office box?

278
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,153
What?

279
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:57,123
A place where he might get mail
other than his home address.

280
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:58,491
I don't think so.

281
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,428
You ever seen any statements
from bank accounts...

282
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:03,596
...that you never knew existed...

283
00:16:03,596 --> 00:16:05,698
...maybe in
a family member's name?

284
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:07,633
No.

285
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:10,536
Any big purchases this year?

286
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:13,206
- Cars? Jewelry?
- No.

287
00:16:13,206 --> 00:16:17,009
After Matthew's tuition,
it's all we can do just to scrape by.

288
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,445
- Matthew?
- Our son.

289
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:21,380
He's autistic. We...

290
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,316
We send him to a special needs school.

291
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:26,919
How much does that cost?

292
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,054
A lot.

293
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:30,122
On a cop's salary?

294
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:36,095
- Yes. Vic works a ton of overtime.
- Is that what he tells you?

295
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:49,408
Why are you asking me
about bank accounts...

296
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:51,010
...and P.O. boxes?

297
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,145
I just want to find out...

298
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:55,581
...why Armadillo's
targeting Vic's team...

299
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:58,751
...and I want to make sure
nobody else gets hurt.

300
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:00,553
Has Vic done something?

301
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:05,992
In you go.

302
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,162
Step back, asshole.

303
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,408
Is everything cool with you?

304
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:24,176
Yes.

305
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:26,812
You seem like
you're holdin' back a little bit.

306
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,817
We got a thousand eyes
on us right now.

307
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:34,353
Calling more attention
by cracking skulls doesn't help.

308
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:46,098
- You want to change the page?
- Cassie?

309
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:48,134
What are you doing here, honey?

310
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:50,736
- Mommy brought us.
- Why?

311
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:52,638
Someone smashed our window.

312
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:54,774
Where's Mommy now?

313
00:17:57,343 --> 00:18:01,047
Someone broke into the house?
Are you okay?

314
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:12,591
All right.

315
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:16,696
- Talk to me.
- Why don't you talk?

316
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:20,366
Somebody's trying to kill you.
They came to our house.

317
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:23,803
I had a security system
put in to protect you. It worked.

318
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:26,605
What if I'd been picking one of them
up from school?

319
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:29,408
I had a P.I. watching you
and the children.

320
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:31,143
- What?
- To be safe.

321
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:34,046
- Without telling me?
- I didn't want to scare you.

322
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:36,749
You just didn't want to admit
to what you've been doing.

323
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:38,317
What did Claudette tell you?

324
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:41,387
Were you involved
with some drug dealer who died?

325
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:42,922
- Jesus Christ...
- Were you?

326
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,359
Sometimes out on the street...

327
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:49,562
...you got to make deals
to make bigger arrests.

328
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:51,797
Now, Claudette got you
all worked up over nothin'

329
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,866
I got more truth from her
in ten minutes...

330
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:56,068
...than I've gotten from you
in a year.

331
00:18:58,404 --> 00:19:00,639
How are we paying
for Matthew's school?

332
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:04,710
You want me to go
find out from her?

333
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:09,115
I love my kids...

334
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:11,984
...and I want a future for them.

335
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:16,722
So right now I really need you
to step up and be on my side.

336
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:27,366
Mom, did you see Daddy?

337
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:30,136
Yes. You know what?
Dad's busy with work right now.

338
00:19:30,136 --> 00:19:31,337
Okay?

339
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,040
Maybe we'll see him later.
All right?

340
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,497
I've got a team member
in the burn unit,...

341
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:00,166
...the guy who did it
out on the street...

342
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,802
...and you think now is a good time
to screw with my family?

343
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:06,605
I think Armadillo went to your house
looking for you, Vic.

344
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:09,341
Lucky your wife and kids
didn't end up in the burn ward.

345
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:13,512
- My family's off limits.
- You tell that to Armadillo.

346
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,147
I'm telling you!

347
00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:26,125
I recommended, weeks ago...

348
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,828
...that the Justice Department
provide protective surveillance...

349
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:29,963
...for the Strike Team.

350
00:20:29,963 --> 00:20:32,365
They didn't want it.
It's a pride thing.

351
00:20:32,365 --> 00:20:34,601
My report to the city council
is due next month.

352
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:37,070
And I'm sure you'll be
fair and accurate.

353
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:44,410
- You wanted to see me?
- I contacted Justice.

354
00:20:44,811 --> 00:20:47,447
Starting tomorrow,
they're assigned to your team...

355
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:49,449
...until Armadillo is in custody.

356
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:51,751
- What?
- Why?

357
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:55,288
This is for your own good.
We can't see anyone else getting hurt.

358
00:20:55,288 --> 00:20:58,091
- Who are you to dictate how I work?
- Excuse me?

359
00:20:58,291 --> 00:20:59,325
Vic.

360
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,329
If I were you, I'd be careful about
the next thing you say.

361
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:06,933
I can't afford to be handcuffed
by some part-timer...

362
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:08,768
...who thinks she knows
what's right.

363
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:11,070
I am a trained litigator...

364
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,072
...with a master's
in criminal justice.

365
00:21:13,072 --> 00:21:14,741
Then stay in the classroom.

366
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:17,577
The cripple called.

367
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:20,446
I mean, the handicapped guy...

368
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:21,548
...called.

369
00:21:26,653 --> 00:21:27,787
Dutch.

370
00:21:28,054 --> 00:21:29,255
Dutch!

371
00:21:29,856 --> 00:21:33,226
City workers found this in a storm
drain a half a mile from the alley.

372
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,495
Looks like our weapon to me.

373
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:37,297
- Prints?
- No,...

374
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:39,566
...but there's a lot of hair and
blood. Check out these etchings.

375
00:21:39,566 --> 00:21:40,567
They're Thai.

376
00:21:40,567 --> 00:21:43,436
I checked out the Thai cultural center
where he volunteers at.

377
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:45,838
This was stolen from there
a couple of days ago.

378
00:21:45,838 --> 00:21:47,507
Maybe that'll help with motive.

379
00:21:47,507 --> 00:21:49,642
Yes. Yes, maybe.

380
00:21:54,213 --> 00:21:55,381
Damn it!

381
00:21:56,349 --> 00:21:57,483
What happened?

382
00:21:57,717 --> 00:21:59,886
I guess the boss
must've got my memo.

383
00:21:59,886 --> 00:22:01,020
Armadillo?

384
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:05,658
Dude that did this had Mexican
prison ink. Thick dialect.

385
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:07,393
One of them imports.

386
00:22:07,594 --> 00:22:09,162
Took my goddamn wheelchair.

387
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:11,197
- How wrong is that?
- Did you get a name?

388
00:22:11,197 --> 00:22:15,234
Better than that. Got the plate.
Blue Ford pickup truck.

389
00:22:16,536 --> 00:22:17,604
God, Van Bro.

390
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:22,742
Nice work, Van Bro.
Sit tight.

391
00:22:22,742 --> 00:22:25,812
- Help is on the way.
- And a new set of wheels.

392
00:22:26,646 --> 00:22:28,047
Somethin' sporty.

393
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,022
- Hands on the wheel. Now.
- Don't even twitch.

394
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:37,190
- Out.
- On the head, Jose.

395
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,459
Let's go.
Let's go!

396
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,361
Get up there.

397
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:48,868
We're looking for Armadillo. Any tips?

398
00:22:49,936 --> 00:22:52,338
I'm gettin' so tired
of playing this game.

399
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:55,942
Here.

400
00:22:56,576 --> 00:22:59,112
Okay, okay, okay! I
know where he is.

401
00:22:59,112 --> 00:23:00,880
Lem, you ride with him.
We'll follow you.

402
00:23:02,448 --> 00:23:03,716
Enjoy the wheelchair.

403
00:23:04,417 --> 00:23:05,618
Get in.

404
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:08,087
He was in line.

405
00:23:08,087 --> 00:23:12,358
Guy behind him sprayed something
in his face with an aerosol can.

406
00:23:12,358 --> 00:23:13,660
Looked like bug spray.

407
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,861
Was there an
argument?

408
00:23:14,861 --> 00:23:17,263
Well, he always takes
forever to order.

409
00:23:17,263 --> 00:23:20,433
So aerosol guy
wanted him to hurry up.

410
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:23,302
When he didn't, the dude said,
"You're buggin' me."

411
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,872
Right in the eyes.
Took off that way.

412
00:23:25,872 --> 00:23:27,106
I was just trying to order.

413
00:23:27,106 --> 00:23:29,042
Every day you hold
up my goddamn line.

414
00:23:29,042 --> 00:23:30,443
I was reading
the menu!

415
00:23:30,443 --> 00:23:33,112
Hot dogs, hamburgers.
That's it, you idiot!

416
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:38,017
- Jerk-off!
- Homo! Goddamn it!

417
00:23:43,189 --> 00:23:45,258
- You married?
- Yes.

418
00:23:45,725 --> 00:23:47,627
I'm gettin' ready to
take the plunge myself.

419
00:23:47,627 --> 00:23:48,761
Good for you.

420
00:23:49,062 --> 00:23:52,165
- You got any kids?
- Yes, I got a boy.

421
00:23:52,165 --> 00:23:53,933
You don't want him
to see you in jail, do you?

422
00:23:55,068 --> 00:23:56,903
- No.
- Good.

423
00:23:57,203 --> 00:23:59,272
So, tell me about
the guy who sprayed you.

424
00:24:01,841 --> 00:24:03,443
He's on the top floor. Back unit.

425
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:05,978
He says Armadillo's got a few guys,
and they're probably packing.

426
00:24:05,978 --> 00:24:09,382
Get the collaterals out of here.
Take the truck, cover the back.

427
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:30,536
You know much
about Thai culture, Malcolm?

428
00:24:31,938 --> 00:24:33,239
I'm not really into my roots.

429
00:24:33,606 --> 00:24:36,909
Yet you volunteer at the Thai
cultural center two nights a week.

430
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,579
It's a good place to meet girls.

431
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,714
<i>Yes.</i>

432
00:24:41,714 --> 00:24:45,151
And to pick up antique artifacts.

433
00:24:48,054 --> 00:24:50,590
This was stolen from there
a couple of days ago...

434
00:24:51,557 --> 00:24:53,526
...from a room you had access to.

435
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:58,831
You see these ornate little symbols?

436
00:24:59,298 --> 00:25:00,967
They represent...

437
00:25:03,102 --> 00:25:07,206
- ..."fertility, family, bloodlines."
- Okay.

438
00:25:07,206 --> 00:25:09,108
- How come you never asked his name?
- Who?

439
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:12,111
The old man you beat up.
You want to hear it?

440
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,214
His last name was Kusa.

441
00:25:15,214 --> 00:25:17,650
Came over from Thailand a
couple of years ago. Kusa.

442
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,185
Am I pronouncing that right?

443
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:21,053
- I guess.
- How would you say it?

444
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:24,357
- I wouldn't.
- So you won't even say his name.

445
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,861
We drop smoke,
head in the front door.

446
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:31,631
Armadillo runs out the back,
Lem's there waiting.

447
00:25:32,598 --> 00:25:34,600
Let's go. Go...

448
00:25:35,802 --> 00:25:36,903
Wait a minute.

449
00:25:40,106 --> 00:25:41,407
What the hell is this?

450
00:25:43,009 --> 00:25:46,679
- What's goin' on?
- I'm unarmed!

451
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:53,386
He called, gave himself up!

452
00:25:53,986 --> 00:25:56,522
- Is that so?
- Turn around.

453
00:25:56,756 --> 00:25:58,925
Looks like he saw
the writin' on the wall.

454
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:08,568
Somebody did a job on his face.

455
00:26:08,868 --> 00:26:10,336
Well, it's an ugly world.

456
00:26:10,703 --> 00:26:12,104
More and more.

457
00:26:15,474 --> 00:26:17,310
I was attacked
by the bug spray guy.

458
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:19,512
- When?
- Three days ago.

459
00:26:19,512 --> 00:26:21,914
I got your partner's card
from the hot dog stand.

460
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:25,585
About the man who was attacked
with bug spray, he got me too.

461
00:26:27,053 --> 00:26:29,188
Serial sprayer? That's weird.

462
00:26:29,188 --> 00:26:30,857
It's kind of a dumb case.

463
00:26:30,857 --> 00:26:32,758
He is hurting people, but...

464
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:35,094
No, same principle as a killer.

465
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:37,997
Driven by inadequacy and frustration.

466
00:26:38,731 --> 00:26:41,834
One acts out with insecticide,
the other with deadly force.

467
00:26:42,401 --> 00:26:43,636
Why don't you run with it?

468
00:26:45,171 --> 00:26:47,306
- Me?
- We're swamped today.

469
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:49,408
Be a while before a detective
can look into it.

470
00:26:49,408 --> 00:26:50,543
I don't know.

471
00:26:50,543 --> 00:26:52,511
Sure you do. You've
got great instincts.

472
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,447
Really?

473
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,049
Calling the cultural center
about that scepter?

474
00:26:57,049 --> 00:26:59,118
I think it's going to be
the key to finding motive.

475
00:27:00,152 --> 00:27:01,954
Bug spray guy's yours, right?

476
00:27:03,089 --> 00:27:04,156
Yes.

477
00:27:05,024 --> 00:27:06,225
Where would you start?

478
00:27:09,328 --> 00:27:11,063
Both attacks took place
within a couple blocks.

479
00:27:11,063 --> 00:27:13,366
- He probably lives within the area.
- Good.

480
00:27:15,401 --> 00:27:16,869
I could call the drug stores,
hardware places...

481
00:27:16,869 --> 00:27:19,171
...see if anyone matching
our description...

482
00:27:19,171 --> 00:27:20,973
...bought any bug spray lately.

483
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:22,942
Sounds like detective work to me.

484
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:28,614
Come on, Claudette. Let me go
inside with you, back you up.

485
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:31,150
Don't take this the wrong way,
but I don't need the help.

486
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,019
We both been working this case.

487
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:35,021
Between what you and I
know, we can trip him up.

488
00:27:35,021 --> 00:27:36,856
I'm going to try this alone.

489
00:27:42,595 --> 00:27:44,263
If you can't make up your mind...

490
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:46,332
...I'll ask Lanie to make the call.

491
00:27:48,801 --> 00:27:50,870
Give her the facts of the case.

492
00:28:01,047 --> 00:28:03,616
You've got a lot of your plate.
Where'd you find the time?

493
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,451
Drug trafficking...

494
00:28:05,952 --> 00:28:08,587
...consolidating a Mexican
power base, murder.

495
00:28:08,587 --> 00:28:10,089
Am I leaving anything out?

496
00:28:11,157 --> 00:28:12,191
Yes.

497
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:14,860
Juvenile rape.

498
00:28:16,996 --> 00:28:18,331
So you say.

499
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:23,069
Let's hope that genius I.Q.
means you know how to help yourself.

500
00:28:23,069 --> 00:28:25,638
<i>We've got you on tape
</i>making a death threat.

501
00:28:25,638 --> 00:28:27,406
<i>That could be anyone's voice.</i>

502
00:28:28,607 --> 00:28:29,909
<i>I'll challenge it in court.</i>

503
00:28:30,476 --> 00:28:33,980
<i>What about the testimony of a cop
</i>with his own grill mark?

504
00:28:34,547 --> 00:28:36,615
You going to challenge that too?

505
00:28:38,184 --> 00:28:39,885
What happened to your face?

506
00:28:40,953 --> 00:28:43,122
You used to be so pretty.

507
00:28:43,122 --> 00:28:44,957
I'll only give my confession...

508
00:28:45,257 --> 00:28:46,759
...to Detective Mackey.

509
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:49,362
You don't make demands.
Not to me.

510
00:28:51,864 --> 00:28:53,366
<i>I speak to Mackey...</i>

511
00:28:54,367 --> 00:28:55,601
<i>...or my lawyer.</i>

512
00:29:28,902 --> 00:29:30,236
<i>I want to talk alone.</i>

513
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,082
The first few weeks are the worst.

514
00:29:44,183 --> 00:29:45,985
Then the skin gets hard.

515
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,388
The stinging goes away.

516
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:51,758
It's time for me to leave.

517
00:29:52,525 --> 00:29:54,794
You should have left
when I gave you the chance.

518
00:29:56,696 --> 00:29:58,431
My business here is done.

519
00:29:59,132 --> 00:30:00,533
Everything's in place.

520
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,136
Now you're going to
help me get home.

521
00:30:03,336 --> 00:30:05,738
- Help you?
- You have no choice.

522
00:30:05,738 --> 00:30:09,008
The second you did this to me,
you gave me control.

523
00:30:09,909 --> 00:30:12,946
So, unless you and your men
want a cell next to mine...

524
00:30:13,846 --> 00:30:15,048
...you'll do what I say.

525
00:30:15,281 --> 00:30:17,550
Get your man
to recant his statement...

526
00:30:17,951 --> 00:30:20,820
...and get me out of here
long enough to cross the border...

527
00:30:21,854 --> 00:30:23,122
...we'll call it even.

528
00:30:23,623 --> 00:30:25,391
What about
the people you burned...

529
00:30:25,391 --> 00:30:27,193
...and that little girl
you raped?

530
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,095
Sometimes...

531
00:30:29,596 --> 00:30:30,997
...life isn't fair.

532
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:51,517
You wanted me to hurt you.

533
00:30:52,552 --> 00:30:54,654
Every scar is a victory.

534
00:30:56,155 --> 00:30:57,757
This is just my biggest.

535
00:31:42,335 --> 00:31:43,403
What'd he say?

536
00:31:43,936 --> 00:31:45,371
He just wanted to gloat.

537
00:31:46,072 --> 00:31:47,340
Guess it's my turn.

538
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,575
He wants to see his lawyer.

539
00:31:51,844 --> 00:31:53,346
The interrogation's over.

540
00:31:59,686 --> 00:32:01,054
There he is.

541
00:32:05,191 --> 00:32:06,325
Excuse me.

542
00:32:07,193 --> 00:32:10,463
- Mr. Jarvis Stanley?
- Yes.

543
00:32:11,631 --> 00:32:13,533
- Let me see your hands.
- Why?

544
00:32:13,533 --> 00:32:15,234
I said let me see your hands.

545
00:32:18,371 --> 00:32:21,340
Put your hands on top of your head
and step away from the car.

546
00:32:31,284 --> 00:32:33,986
Got a pest problem.
It's illegal to carry bug spray?

547
00:32:33,986 --> 00:32:36,155
It is when you're trying
to blind people with it.

548
00:32:37,423 --> 00:32:39,025
They were all buggin' me.

549
00:32:40,893 --> 00:32:42,195
It's not like I killed anyone.

550
00:32:42,195 --> 00:32:44,530
Actually, it's an assault
with a deadly weapon.

551
00:32:45,398 --> 00:32:47,700
Bug spray's poison. That's a felony.

552
00:32:48,501 --> 00:32:50,269
Now you're
startin'to bug me.

553
00:32:55,775 --> 00:32:57,477
- He's got me.
- No.

554
00:32:57,844 --> 00:32:59,812
No way. This does not end like this.

555
00:32:59,812 --> 00:33:01,347
He's going to play
the brutality card...

556
00:33:01,347 --> 00:33:04,450
...if I don't get Ronnie to recant
and set him loose.

557
00:33:05,051 --> 00:33:07,220
- Then that's what we got to do.
- No.

558
00:33:08,221 --> 00:33:10,089
I couldn't look Ronnie in the eye.

559
00:33:16,295 --> 00:33:17,563
I did this.

560
00:33:21,734 --> 00:33:25,304
I'll take all the heat,
make sure you guys get a pass.

561
00:33:25,304 --> 00:33:27,640
Come on.
You could be lookin' at jail time.

562
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:32,945
I barely saw my kids today.

563
00:33:38,151 --> 00:33:39,719
I'm going to go give 'em a call.

564
00:33:49,228 --> 00:33:50,363
What are we going to do?

565
00:33:52,565 --> 00:33:53,933
What are we going to do, Shane?

566
00:33:53,933 --> 00:33:55,168
I'm thinkin'.

567
00:33:56,803 --> 00:33:58,171
God!

568
00:33:58,171 --> 00:33:59,338
Shit!

569
00:34:05,711 --> 00:34:08,014
- Where we goin'?
- To make a deal.

570
00:34:12,185 --> 00:34:14,387
Your family comes from the
area in northern Thailand...

571
00:34:14,387 --> 00:34:15,855
...known as the Hilltribe region...

572
00:34:15,855 --> 00:34:17,657
...known for its tribal wars.

573
00:34:18,624 --> 00:34:23,129
In fact, your family's been feuding
with another clan for over 800 years.

574
00:34:23,629 --> 00:34:25,164
- Not me.
- Rape.

575
00:34:25,565 --> 00:34:27,033
Torture. Genocide.

576
00:34:27,567 --> 00:34:29,569
That's a pretty gnarly family tree.

577
00:34:30,203 --> 00:34:32,238
The other family's name
is Kusa.

578
00:34:32,638 --> 00:34:35,074
And now I know why
you beat him into a coma.

579
00:34:36,042 --> 00:34:38,311
And now a jury's
going to know it too.

580
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:45,151
My dad was pissed.

581
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:48,921
Your dad.

582
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:52,558
Old guy comes into the center
and signed the guest book. Kusa.

583
00:34:54,894 --> 00:34:57,129
So I told my dad,
you know, as a joke.

584
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:01,467
But he went crazy.

585
00:35:02,501 --> 00:35:05,972
Starts talking about killing this guy,
like, really killing him.

586
00:35:07,673 --> 00:35:09,041
So I figure...

587
00:35:09,041 --> 00:35:11,010
I'd scare Kusa away first...

588
00:35:12,478 --> 00:35:15,314
...act like I was protecting
the family name or whatever.

589
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:18,684
Get him to leave the neighborhood.

590
00:35:20,953 --> 00:35:24,857
And the scepter was to
drive the point home.

591
00:35:25,258 --> 00:35:28,494
I followed him outside the center,
and I told him who I was.

592
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:33,165
Before I could say anything...

593
00:35:33,165 --> 00:35:35,401
...the old freak spits in my face.

594
00:35:35,768 --> 00:35:39,138
He starts whaling on me,
screaming at me in Thai.

595
00:35:42,308 --> 00:35:44,677
I only hit him back
to protect myself.

596
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:49,181
He was half dead,
hanging from a pole.

597
00:35:49,849 --> 00:35:51,550
That's a pretty tough sell
for self-defense.

598
00:35:51,918 --> 00:35:53,352
It was, at first.

599
00:35:55,187 --> 00:35:57,423
But something happened to me.

600
00:36:00,426 --> 00:36:01,494
Blood.

601
00:36:02,762 --> 00:36:05,131
I never stood up
for my family before.

602
00:36:07,767 --> 00:36:09,702
I know it was wrong...

603
00:36:12,371 --> 00:36:14,774
...but somehow it made sense.

604
00:36:25,484 --> 00:36:26,619
What'd he do?

605
00:36:26,619 --> 00:36:28,554
The guy walked right past us
smokin' weed.

606
00:36:28,554 --> 00:36:31,223
We didn't want to haul him in, but
we asked him to put it out...

607
00:36:31,824 --> 00:36:33,626
...blew smoke right in our face.

608
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,428
Idiot.

609
00:36:44,203 --> 00:36:46,539
- Now we know the "why."
- Yes.

610
00:36:47,073 --> 00:36:49,742
And I couldn't have done
it without you. Thanks.

611
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:52,411
You know, up until
now I was...

612
00:36:52,411 --> 00:36:54,580
...really focused on getting
ahead on the street.

613
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,649
But after seeing
the whole detective angle...

614
00:36:58,284 --> 00:37:00,419
I don't know, it just kinda
felt like we were partners.

615
00:37:00,419 --> 00:37:03,522
There was a real connection there.
Good back and forth.

616
00:37:03,522 --> 00:37:05,191
- Yes.
- You were great.

617
00:37:05,858 --> 00:37:07,093
Thanks.

618
00:37:09,295 --> 00:37:10,363
What?

619
00:37:15,801 --> 00:37:18,137
Kim's making me dinner tonight.
I've got to...

620
00:37:18,137 --> 00:37:20,906
I have a lot of... Shit.

621
00:37:27,346 --> 00:37:29,048
- What's going on?
- My god!

622
00:37:29,048 --> 00:37:30,149
What?

623
00:37:31,117 --> 00:37:32,284
I just...

624
00:37:34,453 --> 00:37:36,188
I almost kissed Dutch.

625
00:37:36,188 --> 00:37:38,124
My God. Why?

626
00:37:38,124 --> 00:37:40,826
I don't know. It was
a momentary lapse.

627
00:37:42,028 --> 00:37:43,329
Was he devastated?

628
00:37:43,763 --> 00:37:46,232
No. He's the one that
pulled away from me.

629
00:37:46,766 --> 00:37:48,667
- My God.
- I know. Shoot me.

630
00:37:51,871 --> 00:37:53,672
Keys! Give me the keys!

631
00:37:54,874 --> 00:37:56,242
Get away from him!

632
00:37:58,377 --> 00:37:59,645
Get off of him!

633
00:38:01,013 --> 00:38:03,149
Hands up!
Hands up, everybody!

634
00:38:04,884 --> 00:38:08,220
Watch the knife!
Call a medic!

635
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,455
I'm calling!

636
00:38:13,926 --> 00:38:15,061
On the wall.

637
00:38:15,928 --> 00:38:18,064
Let's search 'em nicely. Let's go.

638
00:38:19,899 --> 00:38:21,434
Jesus Christ!

639
00:38:21,867 --> 00:38:23,769
- Who searched that guy?
- I did.

640
00:38:23,769 --> 00:38:25,738
How could you miss
a knife that size?

641
00:38:25,738 --> 00:38:28,407
It wasn't on him when I frisked him
after the arrest.

642
00:38:29,008 --> 00:38:30,309
Upstairs.

643
00:38:37,283 --> 00:38:38,384
Nope.

644
00:38:55,501 --> 00:38:56,536
What happened?

645
00:38:57,637 --> 00:38:59,639
Los Mag O.G. with a grudge.

646
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:02,842
Stabbed him nine times.
Won't say why.

647
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:05,578
Jesus.

648
00:39:07,213 --> 00:39:08,781
Come on, let's go.

649
00:39:10,149 --> 00:39:11,417
Unbelievable?

650
00:39:24,997 --> 00:39:26,632
Armadillo Quintero.

651
00:39:27,433 --> 00:39:30,536
I thought maybe you might like that
for your personal files.

652
00:39:31,137 --> 00:39:33,840
This case is closed.
File it where it belongs.

653
00:39:36,609 --> 00:39:38,177
You want to know
what I think happened?

654
00:39:40,446 --> 00:39:43,316
Vic was Tio's drug landlord,
gave him protection.

655
00:39:43,816 --> 00:39:46,619
Tio gave him favors
and a cut of the business.

656
00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:50,556
When Armadillo killed Tio,
Vic fried his face on the grill...

657
00:39:50,556 --> 00:39:53,059
...and that's why he didn't
want me to find him.

658
00:39:59,766 --> 00:40:01,334
Why'd you get in my way?

659
00:40:04,036 --> 00:40:05,338
I made a mistake.

660
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,909
You just now realizing that?

661
00:40:15,948 --> 00:40:17,049
Sorry.

662
00:40:29,829 --> 00:40:31,364
I heard about your suspension.

663
00:40:32,665 --> 00:40:34,534
I searched that guy
from head to toe.

664
00:40:36,002 --> 00:40:37,503
Call your P.B.A. rep.

665
00:40:38,171 --> 00:40:40,173
Get your side of the story on record.

666
00:40:41,474 --> 00:40:43,309
Is all of this a joke, Vic?

667
00:40:43,943 --> 00:40:45,912
- What?
- Everything.

668
00:40:47,346 --> 00:40:49,682
Everything that's
happening to me lately.

669
00:40:52,018 --> 00:40:53,886
You're a good cop, Danny.

670
00:41:00,359 --> 00:41:01,727
I miss you.

671
00:41:04,363 --> 00:41:05,565
I know.

672
00:41:06,866 --> 00:41:08,868
I just can't act on that right now.

673
00:41:13,539 --> 00:41:14,774
Right.

674
00:41:26,953 --> 00:41:28,287
Did you get 'em to sleep?

675
00:41:34,527 --> 00:41:36,429
I got a guy to replace
the window tomorrow.

676
00:41:36,829 --> 00:41:38,297
I've got things to do tomorrow.

677
00:41:38,598 --> 00:41:40,666
I'll have 'em call ahead,
make sure you're at home.

678
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,736
Just leave me his number.
I'll take care of it myself.

679
00:41:44,804 --> 00:41:45,838
Okay.

680
00:41:49,242 --> 00:41:52,278
Listen, I got to have
more time with the kids.

681
00:41:52,278 --> 00:41:56,148
Not just dinners. I need some
mornings, some weekends.

682
00:41:58,251 --> 00:42:01,053
They're my kids too. If I want to
see them more, I'm going to see them.

683
00:42:01,587 --> 00:42:03,422
You can't even spend
three dinners a week...

684
00:42:03,422 --> 00:42:05,391
...and now you want more time?

685
00:42:05,391 --> 00:42:07,260
Goddamn it, don't do this.

686
00:42:12,231 --> 00:42:13,799
I'm going to make more time. Okay?

687
00:42:16,002 --> 00:42:17,770
I got to get back to basics.

688
00:42:19,272 --> 00:42:21,107
Start by bein' a good dad again.

689
00:42:24,076 --> 00:42:26,779
- You can't promise them that.
- I'm serious.

690
00:42:30,883 --> 00:42:32,418
I got to make some changes.

691
00:42:40,259 --> 00:42:42,128
Leave the number for the window guy.

692
00:42:45,164 --> 00:42:46,699
Little Pop heads back
to Pelican Bay...

693
00:42:46,699 --> 00:42:49,368
...where he has more respect and
business than he ever did before.

694
00:42:49,368 --> 00:42:52,538
We're going to cover his mom's
expenses until after the sentencing.

695
00:42:58,611 --> 00:43:00,846
I'll never forget
what you guys did for me.

696
00:43:00,846 --> 00:43:02,748
Don't worry. We won't let you.

697
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,121
Tell Ronnie I'll see him tomorrow.

698
00:43:10,289 --> 00:43:11,724
Enjoy the painting.

699
00:43:12,091 --> 00:43:13,459
Not a problem.

700
00:43:14,593 --> 00:43:16,996
Take it easy. Night, boss.

701
00:43:31,844 --> 00:43:33,245
We both know...

702
00:43:34,947 --> 00:43:36,482
...what happened to Ronnie...

703
00:43:38,184 --> 00:43:39,652
...that's on you.

704
00:43:41,587 --> 00:43:43,356
It's all on you.

705
00:44:11,517 --> 00:44:13,786
- Yes.
- You sure?

706
00:44:17,957 --> 00:44:19,058
That's him.
