Wouldn't surprise me.

He could be hiding anywhere.
How do we find him?

335
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,631
I got a C.I., works a pawn shop.

336
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,195
He can put the word out on the street
that PD never found the necklace.

That it's just sitting there

the way Will's victims suffered.

Said he was gonna rape you?

Being afraid ruined it.

660
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,275
Yeah, it did.
Well, I'm not afraid anymore.

661
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,191
So at some point,

662
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,676
look past my bad start,
give me another chance.

663
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,279
Let me know.

664
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,035
Antwon saw the coming tide.

665
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,832
Black and white's days
are numbered.

666
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,713
It's all about making peace
with the red, yellow and brown.

667
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,992
He paid for your education,
made sure someone in his
organization

668
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,589
could speak the languages
so he wouldn't be left behind.

669
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,279
RAWLING:
Goodwill ambassador.

670
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:38,878
Only instead of brokering
peace, you broker drug deals,
gang alliances.

671
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:42,550
How did Antwon get the Russians
and Nigerians together?

672
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,630
The Russians had a beef with PD.
Because we took down Kozodav?

673
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,069
Antwon was plugged into that.

674
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,994
He offered Tretiak the Nigerians
as hired help.

675
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,237
Why were Officers Haimes
and Miller targeted?

676
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,237
Tretiak's idea.

677
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:03,598
The black cop pissed him off.
Gave him a speeding ticket.

678
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,558
And you?

679
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:10,069
I translated. Drove.

680
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,278
Made sure the Nigerians had what
they needed to get the job done.

681
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,232
Antwon's emissary.

682
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,950
J ASON: Russians have
an international pipeline.

683
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:21,072
Need them in your corner
if you wanna play outside the States.

684
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,719
Killing the cops
was a handshake.

685
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,798
Antwon knew if they did this,
they'd be tied.

686
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,473
There'd be trust.

687
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,636
An oath in blood.

688
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,154
Police.
Mrs. Faulks?

689
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,628
JULIEN:
I hear a TV.

690
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,512
[MAN SPEAKING
INDISTINCTLY ON TV]

691
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:46,799
Shit. She said the intruder
came through the back the last time.

692
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,076
Mrs. Faulks, police.
You in there?

693
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,395
[GUNSHOT]

694
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,160
Ow! Damn it, shit!
One-Tango-13. Shots fired.

695
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,628
Officer down.

696
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,392
Oh, God.

697
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,751
Let me see your hands.
Put that gun down,
put the gun down!

698
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,353
Drop it!
JOANNA: I thought you were...

699
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,596
Put it down!
I didn't know, I'm so sorry.

700
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,360
Put your hands on your head!
Put your hands on your head!

701
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,118
I heard them outside, I thought you...
DANNY: Oh, God.

702
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:36,596
Step down, move, now!
I'm so sorry.

703
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,314
PHILLIPS:
Give us a minute. Now!

704
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,632
DEA just requested all
departmental files on
Antwon Mitchell.

705
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,398
Shit, are they thinking
of making a deal?

706
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,670
Witness protection, immunity.
I hear it's done.

707
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:52,032
What? We've got to get it
off the table. We just linked
him to the two cop murders.

708
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,037
How?
His half-brother gave him up.

709
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,754
Antwon's gonna walk.
You and your boy really did it.

710
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,552
Me?
And Aceveda.

711
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:02,070
I know all about the dance
you two are planning for
the Pol Com session.

712
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,554
You help him navigate
this Mitchell deal?

713
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,990
What the hell
are you talking about?

714
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:10,515
Aceveda brokered the deal
between Mitchell and DEA?

715
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,439
A woman like you? Figured
you'd get to know your bedmates

716
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,676
before you lay down with them.
Shit.

717
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,668
RAWLING: The deal is off.
J ASON: What?

718
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,599
Big brother struck a better one,
which leaves you shit out of luck.

719
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,631
You can't do that.
You're gonna take a lethal injection

720
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,308
for the killing
of two cops.

721
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,875
And I'm gonna
be there to watch.

722
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,272
Put him back in the cage.

723
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,914
What the hell happened?
Aceveda shit all over us.

724
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,634
Brokered Antwon to the DEA.
Witness protection.

725
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,558
They're letting him go?

726
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,872
Excuse me, the councilman's...
ACEVEDA: It's all right.

727
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,594
Where the hell do you get off
cutting a deal for Antwon Mitchell?

728
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,752
Hey, it's the DEA's deal.
They asked me to approach him.

729
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,595
Antwon ordered the hit on our cops.
His half-brother just gave him up.

730
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,758
You just set a cop killer free,
you dick.

731
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,194
The kid said
he acted alone.

732
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,311
That family has a little bit
of trouble with the truth.

733
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,714
VIC:
He lied.

734
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,633
Call the deal off.

735
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,040
I can't.
It's in DEA's hands now.

736
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:19,989
Carl and Scooby were
stabbed over and over again.

737
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,270
Probably alive long enough
to feel most of it.

738
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,118
ACEVEDA: I was there when
the bodies were carried out.

739
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,834
I'm the one who found them.
I'm still a cop.

740
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:30,914
Bullshit. Cops want only one thing,
Antwon executed for what he did.

741
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:34,271
Look, the DEA cannot make a case
against the Salvadoran cartel.

742
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,478
Mitchell is willing to
give up the entire pipeline.
All right, this is huge.

743
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,513
You and your council buddies
get a few favours from Sacramento.

744
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,996
Do you think I care about a DEA win?
Carl and Scooby were my men.

745
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,156
You're the one who came
crawling to me, asking for a lifeline.

746
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,038
And I was an asshole to think
you were an option.

747
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:52,273
Watch it, you still need me.
I need shit from you.

748
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,670
You can take
your backroom handshakes,

749
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:59,317
your DEA cronies and your
self-serving cop-killer deals

750
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,838
and you can shove
them up your ass.

751
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,992
You're not a cop.

752
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,311
You never were.

753
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,192
