the pressure.

We raised over $900,000.

44

I guess taking houses
is profitable.

45

That's money out of

Thanks to their hard work,
we got injunctions.

After we serve these, you see
two or more One-Niners
together in Farmington,

51
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,313
that's called congregating
in groups, and that's jail time.

so let's get these served

to her apartment,
didn't, um, pack any bags.

What if Antwon Mitchell
found out Angie gave up
the cul-de-sac bust?

65

That would have
to come from here.

Is there any chance
that word got out?

And I'm supposed to pretend
those two things aren't related?

a girl to that.

We can still salvage this one.

324
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,116
Spider gave up
his One-Niner contact.

325

Do I wanna know
how you managed that?

326
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,720
We brought his family in
for leverage, I used it.

327
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,638
If you ask me,
they probably packed up.

328

You know, cook houses
move all the time.

What did you get
from Spider?

330
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:00,355
The El Salvadorans
are shipping their drugs
to a church on Avon.

331
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,788

332

You're kidding me.

333
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,071
Sounds like Spider sold you a load.
He's not risking his family.

334

It's the real thing.

335

I'll work on a warrant.

336

Occurred to me to take that down.

CLAUDETTE:
Detective Huarez in San Antonio's
got a different angle.

He's been tracking murders
in the L.A. area.

346
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,554
Because there aren't
enough in Texas?

347
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,274

relocated to Farmington
a month ago.

Hey, exposed dick?
Thanks for the warning,
Dutchboy.

349

questioned in four separate
homicides.

350
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,794
Suspected him on two murders
three days apart, then nothing
for six months.

351
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,877
Witnesses placed him
at a couple of the scenes.

352
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,878
But detectives in San Antonio
weren't able to make
anything stick.

353
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,189
Well, what's the connection
to our body?

354
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,198
All the victims were young
black women in public places.

355
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,149
Raine was killed seven blocks
from where Kleavon's sister lives.

356
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,755
Are we gonna be like this
from now on?

357
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,237
Huarez tried to warn
somebody in this department
a few weeks ago

358
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,396
that we had a thrill killer
on our hands.

359

they take chances.

This guy's patient,
an opportunity killer.

361
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,030

screwed it up.

his wife too well.

Little after midnight?

384
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,037
Found this in, uh,
Raine's underwear drawer.

00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,919
She mentioned you.

ready to go with me."

and a girl named, uh, Janelle.

389

about that collage
I did for her birthday?

00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,838

does collages,

a hundred times. What was
I supposed to do, bro?

I know the mom,
she works at Mission Cross.

485
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,435
Uh, I can call her.

486
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,628
How's she doing?

487
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,273
Good. Thanks again.

488
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:13,109
Vic had a uni with her
the whole time. It wasn't like
he left her totally alone.

489
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,151
I can't believe
he didn't call me.

490
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,078
Divorce is tough.

491
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,918
Mine was a while ago.

492
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,352
Anyway, thanks again.

493
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,439
It was really nice of you.

494
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,959
You're welcome.

495
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:31,036
Listen, um, wanna have
dinner some time?

496
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,310
Dinner?
Why not?

497
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,795
Three kids, a job,
selling our house.

498
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,877
I don't have time. I don't know.
We'll work around your schedule.

499

I don't know. You work with Vic.
We barely see each other.

500
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,240
I tried it with a cop once.

501

Vic and I could not
be more different.

502
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,516
Reverend, I have
a signed search warrant.

503
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,948
You must open the door.

504
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,116
This is a house of worship.

505
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,151
There's an easier way
to do this.

506
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,713
There are no drugs here.

507
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,194
Except for the heroin.

508
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,075
Reverend, I have
the legal right to come inside.
Use force if I have to.

509
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,157
Neither of us wants that.

510
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,078
Then let the Lord be
your judge.

511
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,838
We could pack it up,
come back tonight.

512
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,076
Yeah, give them time
to flush the tar?

We already look
like assholes.

we have something
in hand to show for it.

right?

516
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,873

Oh, yeah.

517
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,479
Okay, people.

518
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,558
Let's go.
You know who
we're looking for.

519
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,598
Remember that this is a church.
There are civilians inside.

520
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,075
So do your jobs,
but use extra care.

521
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,032
VIC: All right, who's got the hawk?
We do.

Good. Four teams,
two in the front, one on the side,
one in the back. Let's do it.

Captain, I'm not breaking down
a church door.

524
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,231
Just think of it as a drug
warehouse, because that's
what it is today.

525
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,074
We shouldn't be going
in like this.

526
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,431
Get in the back,
both of you.

527
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:05,192
What the hell are you doing?
You're knocking us out of this?

528
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,994
All right, Reverend,
last chance.
Open the door.

529
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,634

BROCK: An army should encamp me.

535
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,792
You all right?
BROCK: My heart does not fear.

536
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,673
Sofer and Lowe got the other ones
coming out the back.

Just the.38.

Yeah, botulism,

over 500 bucks of heroin

knows not to shoot
that much poison.

We'll do this later.

to the station?

Carmen dropped a bomb
on me, backup sitter blew
a tyre.

What was I to do? I had it.
Should've called. Obviously not.

about Raine earlier.

You know, your boss found
those order forms
you've been changing.

588
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,833
I sold a few DVD players,
a couple of Xboxes
on the side.

589
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,598
I was gonna tell you
all about it.

590

No way.

591
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,790
Really? Her diary,
it says she
confronted you.

592
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,508
Said she was gonna go
to your manager.

593
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,553
I know, you were gonna
tell me all about it.

594
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:10,833
Now, when Raine confronted
you, what happened?

595
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,311
You probably tried
to reason with her.

596
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:17,316
Look, if it were up to me,
I'd pin this on a real killer.

shit on you, didn't she?

You wanna tell how
the world got upside-down
on your watch?

648
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,150
SHANE: Seeing as you
were misusing a house
of the Lord,

649
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,918
I'd say
divine intervention.

650
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,511
He must really
hate you.

651
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,517
Only reason he'd talk
to me like that

652
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,870
because he wants
to see y'all dead or in jail.

653
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:56,192
Vic Mackey wants you gone.
We're the only thing standing
in his way.

654
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,152
You think I need your ass,
you're wrong.

655
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,112
You think you don't,
you're wrong.

656
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,710
Look, protecting you
is a full-time gig
plus overtime.

657
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,911
So you can either tell me
what you're into,

658
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,712
or I can keep
chasing Vic's tail.

659
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,229
Some days we'll catch it.
Some days we won't.

660
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,637
I'll think about it.

661
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,193
Yeah, you do that.

662
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,354
ARMY: Antwon's gonna drop the body.
He's not that stupid.

663
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,154
Him being stupid is
not what I'm worried about.

664
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,830
Well, I didn't hear you complaining
about my leadership skills
when I got you blown.

665
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,235
This isn't doing favours
to get intel on bad guys.

666
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,237
You got me taking it up the ass
from Antwon Mitchell.

667
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,112
Ramming cars to keep us
out of prison.

668
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,117
I've dealt with guys
like this before.

669
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:43,148
You or Mackey? Do you even
have a clue how we're
getting out of this?

670
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,635
Look, I'm getting
us close.

671
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,311
This guy thinks he can kill
this little girl right
in front of us?

672
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:54,193
We're gonna find
that little girl, we're gonna
give her a proper burial.

673
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,799
Then when the time
is right

674
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,798
we're gonna shove a stick
of dynamite up his ass.

675
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,510
MONICA: Dr. Alvin Bernard's
clinic has been providing
free pre-natal care

676
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,631
to Farmington's poor
for 21 years,

677
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:14,913
which is why I'm so pleased,
Al, to give you
this cheque for $10,000.

678
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,236
REPORTER 1:
Is that money
from seizures?

679
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,795
Part of my promise to give
a third of what we get

680
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,877
from asset-forfeitures
back to the community.

681
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:25,516
How does that community
feel about your decision
to invade a church?

682
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,234
I wouldn't characterise it
quite that way.

683
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,908
We found 12 kilos of
tar heroin inside there.

684
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,678
I'd say they're pretty
damn happy.

685
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,438
REPORTER 1: Any plans to seize it?
No.

686
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,914
REPORTER 2:
Is the reverend under arrest?

687
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,509
The only people under arrest
are known drug dealers

688
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,756
with affiliations
to Farmington One-Niners.

689
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,838
So you'd interrupt another baptism
to put away a gang member?

690
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,877
I'd interrupt
my grandmother's funeral

691
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,789
if it meant taking
dangerous narcotics off the streets
our children walk on.

692
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,592
But don't tell that
to my grandma,

693
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,758
because she's still full of piss
and vinegar in Tarzana.

694
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,238
Reporters were tough today.

695
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,795
We keep storming churches,
they're gonna get tougher.

696
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,390
You were all for it earlier.
I was. I am.

697
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,910
It's just this thing's to good to blow...
Hoda Stubbs was killed.

698
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,918
Angie too, I'm guessing.
I plan on finding who did it.

699
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:16,271
When you do, ask about the leak
at the warehouse today.

700
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,118
We don't know
if there was a leak.

701
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,471
Even if there was, we don't
know they're related.
Could be accidental.

702
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,591
Stop bullshitting me.

703
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,870
You vouched for Shane.
What about Army?

704
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,877
He seems like a good kid.
I don't think...

705
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,799
I don't care what you think.
What do you know?

706
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,071
Is there a reason you don't
wanna dig deeper on this?

707
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,955
I'm not about witch hunts.
I've been on the other side
of a few.

708
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,835
I chose you for this job because
I needed somebody as hungry
as me to make it work.

709
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,917
And I'm getting it done.
Why are you riding me?

710
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,350
Because shit is falling
through the cracks.

711
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,393
Pressure on the seizure
programme is only gonna
get more intense.

712
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,955
And when it does, that shit
is gonna rise straight
to the surface.

713
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:56,517
If you can't withstand
scrutiny about anything,

714
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,190
I need you to step aside.

715
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:05,553
I don't step aside. I step up.

716
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,919
Which is the other reason
I chose you.

717
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,236
Find the leak.

718
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,508
ARMY:
I mean, that's some
cold ass shit.

719
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,149
Can't tell the Iraqi insurgents
from the plain old Iraqi idiots.

720
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:25,875
Yeah, and no difference here.
Somebody gets in the way,
we keep rolling. I'm just saying.

721
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,350
Maybe that's the way
we gotta look at things.

722
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,397
What's up?
Son of a bitch, what did...?

723
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,555
She was 14.

724
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,749
SHANE:
What the hell's
your problem?

725
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,673
LEMONHEAD:
You bring Angie
to Antwon Mitchell yourself, huh?

726
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,388
Hand her with a bow,
or just tell him where
to find her?

727
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,596
No. No.
No? Where is she then?!

728
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,559
Back off. Just back off.
I got it, okay? I got it.

729
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,155
Where is she then,
Shane?

730
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,750
Where's Angie?
What are you asking me for, man?

731
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,951
You telling me you're not
in bed with Antwon Mitchell?

732
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,670
You told him Angie gave up
that cul-de-sac bust.

733
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,518
No, man,
I would never do that.

734
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,832
What happened to her, Shane?
What happened to her then?

735
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,473
I don't know.
Dude, she was 14.

736
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,352
She just wanted
to get her mom clean.

737
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,879
You tell me what you did!

738
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,957
Nothing! Nothing!

739
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,071
Look, you know
that I would never...

740
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,838
You know I would
never hurt a kid.

741
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,474
Look, I got one
of my own now, man.

742
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,754
Yeah, I know you.
I know you're lying.

743
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,311
I didn't kill that girl.

744
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,429
And I didn't give her name up
to Antwon.

745
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,195
So you just stay
out of my face.

746
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:37,751
I lose that one percent
of doubt I got, we'll be
mixing it up again.

747
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,149
Captain says she wants
to hear your opinions,
but only hers is right.

748
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,555
DAVID: Agendas have
a way of creating
tunnel vision.

749
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,990
She said I could put in for a transfer.
Sure.

750
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,952
Stock the pond
with true believers,

751
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,833
make implied threats
to get rid of ones who aren't.

752
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,439
You don't think
I should leave?

753
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,552
I think if you wanted to,
you wouldn't have
called me.

754
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:13,355
I grew up in Farmington.
I don't wanna see it
torn more apart.

755
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,915
What is it you want
me to do, Julien?

756
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,076
You've got power.

757
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,470
Help us to stop her.

758
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,672
Going after a police captain
is no walk in the park.

759
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,598
I should know.

760
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:30,437
There are other officers
of colour that agree with me.

761
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,198
We wouldn't be alone.

762
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,994
I remember the last time
you and I went down
this path.

763
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:39,074
Things got messy,
and you left me
twisting in the wind.

764
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,191
Not this time.

765
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:45,678
Vic Mackey, he's got
a lot invested in this policy.
He'll come after you.

766
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,438
Could dredge up the past.

767
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:51,189
I can handle it.
I'm a different man now.

768
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,036
RONNIE:
Russian taxi king's
expanded his realm.

769
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,037
Added three more cabs to the fleet.

770
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,312
Alex the Conqueror.
How many cabs we got
wired so far?

771
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:09,075
Even dozen, even managed
to get one in his personal ride.

772
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,952
Sweet.

773
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,353
LEMONHEAD:
Yeah, what do you want?

774
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,755
What the hell you think you're doing
going after Shane?

775
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,359
He ran right back
and told you, huh?

776
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,711
You got suspicions, fine.
We all agreed we'd keep
them to ourselves.

777
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:24,037
Look, there's a 14-year-old girl
rotting out there someplace.

778
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,639
Are you in on that too?
What?

779
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,512
You saying
you gotta keep Shane close.

780
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,757
Maybe you gotta keep me
far away because you're back
to business as usual.

781
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,678
Riding in Mitchell's pocket
with Shane.

782
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,110
I wanna bring down Antwon
and find that girl
as much as you do.

783
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,436
Really?
Prove it.

784
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,750
Let me back in.

785
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,516
It's complicated.

786
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,711
You gotta do things my way.

787
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,232
Oh, you mean, I agree
to protect Shane
like always, right?

788
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,873
Right?

789
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,839
We added another car
in the garage sting.

790
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:08,992
Shane didn't tell me
you came after him. I saw it.

791
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,711
Jesus Christ.

792
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,832
Lem's one crazy-ass
white boy.

793
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,190
You really used
to be tight?

794
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,358
SHANE:
Yeah.

795
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,077
Lifetime ago.

796
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,591
What does he know
about us?

797
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:35,759
Nothing. He's just guessing,
he can't prove anything.

798
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,192
I'll handle him.

799
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,668
Look, you're just gonna
have to trust me.

800
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,475
I'm gonna handle
all this shit.

801
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,793
It's not about
protecting Shane anymore.

802
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,756
It's about stopping him.

803
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,758
