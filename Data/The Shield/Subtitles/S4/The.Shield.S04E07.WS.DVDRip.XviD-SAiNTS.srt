00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,711
Vic and me will ride together.
You ride with Armie and Hielo.

168
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,037
Ready? Let's go.

169
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,633
Stay cool. Play the
good soldier, all right?

170
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,991
The guy with Hielo, that's Ernesto.
He's the Byz Lat contraband king.

171
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,875
Guess he's gonna have to run
his kingdom from a cell in Chino.

172
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,038
The other Mexican, that's Garcia.

173
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,075
He's the one who works
on the Indian reservation.

174
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,316
GARCIA:
I've been known to get
my hands on a pack or two.

175
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,476
ERNESTO:
I need cartons. Lots of them.

176
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,238
GARCIA:
I can get 300
cartons a month.

177
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,589
ERNESTO:
How much?

178
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,951
GARCIA:
Ten thousand in cash,
on delivery.

179
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,750
Got him hooked,
about to get booked.

180
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,158
That was quick. Hey, hope you
didn't mind me calling your cell phone.

181
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,920
Not at all. Corrine Mackey,
this is Capt. Monica Rawling.

182
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,475
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you. How's the girl?

183
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,908
Joya's unconscious.

184
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,793
Her oesophagus is badly burned
and there's stomach damage.

185
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,151
She's been put on a ventilator.
DUTCH: Where are the parents?

186
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,035
That's her foster father
over there. He brought her in.

187
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,151
There are also signs
of a sexual assault.

188
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,112
Waiting for the results
of the rape kit.

189
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,595
What did she swallow?
Some sort of household cleaner.

190
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,633
Should have killed her. It still might.
Can we see her?

191
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,919
RAWLING:
Child Services?

192
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,712
Sending over a case worker now.

193
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,956
Yeah, that'll fix everything.

194
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,111
Was Joya in a private
or group home?

195
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,389
CORRINE:
I don't know.

196
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,672
Could be an attempt by the rapist
to destroy DNA evidence.

197
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,351
If the sexual assault extended
to an oral nature.

198
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,672
Thanks for calling right away.

199
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,917
Bring the foster care father
back to the Barn. Get his take
on what happened.

200
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,872
We'll run by his house,
see what we can learn.

201
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,675
You're splitting us up?
I'm just marshalling our resources.

202
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,359
Hi, come on in.
RAWLING: Captain Rawling.

203
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,879
LIZ: Hi.
CLAUDETTE: Claudette Wyms.

204
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,469
Hi. How's Joya?
She's suffered a lot of damage.

205
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,671
It's terrible. These children
have so many problems.

206
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,871
They experience violence
so they get violent.

207
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,672
Hi.
RAWLING: Who was home?

208
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,713
Uh, all the kids. We have seven
with us now. Frank was here.

209
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,313
I was out getting groceries.

210
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,391
And he called me on his way
to the hospital.

211
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,955
Hi. What's your name?
Bibi.

212
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,912
We need to see all the children.
LIZ: Okay.

213
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,798
Gather everybody.
Bring them to the living room.

214
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,752
Can you show us where
your husband found Joya?

215
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,154
Sure. This way.

216
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,118
Uh, this is the kids' bathroom.

217
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,678
Over here.

218
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,348
Sorry about the smell.
Joya threw up.

219
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,074
You found an empty bottle
of drain cleaner. Where is it?

220
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,397
I'll ask Bibi, she's the oldest.
She looks out for the younger ones.

221
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,511
CLAUDETTE:
These meds belong
to all the kids?

222
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,314
LIZ:
Yeah. They're all
taking something.

223
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,317
Like I said, they
have problems.

224
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,272
RAWLING:
Why is a padlock on this door?

225
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,553
Oh. The closet is our safe place.

226
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,039
RAWLING:
Safe for who?

227
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,514
CLAUDETTE:
You lock the kids up in there?

228
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,597
LIZ:
Yeah, we give them time-outs
on occasion.

229
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,592
Most of them
have behavioural disorders.

230
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,758
This lets them calm down.
Keeps the other kids safe.

231
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,269
You realise you've admitted
to child endangerment?

232
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,277
LIZ:
My husband says it's not.

233
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,472
I mean, people send kids
to their rooms, right?

234
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,636
This is the only space we have.

235
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,149
Any of the kids
capable of attacking Joya?

236
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,318
Making her drink Drano?
Take your pick.

237
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,358
Got an update?
Yeah, the prelim just came back.

238
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,876
Joya wasn't raped this
morning. The healing
looks to be 24 to 48 hours.

239
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,435
What about the father?
DUTCH: Definitely a control freak.

240
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,552
So the closet-o'-horrors
doesn't surprise me.

241
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,797
Not sure he's a rapist though.
Files from the foster care kids?

242
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,157
Yeah, Child Services just
sent them over. They read
like the Marquis de Sade.

243
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,277
One of them's
probably our liquid plumber.

244
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,756
So we have six suspects.
DUTCH: You mean seven.

245
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,394
Well, I'm not counting Joya.
Neither am I.

246
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,352
There were six kids.
We met them all.

247
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,870
Not according
to these CS documents.

248
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,631
Uh-huh.

249
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,790
"Darnell Garry. Age 17.

250
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,037
Bipolar, history of violence."

251
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,352
So where is he?

252
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,111
Tell us about Darnell Garry.

253
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,392
He was the oldest.
Ran away about three months ago.

254
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,556
RAWLING:
You never called
Children's Services?

255
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,637
FRANK:
I did. Also sent an e-mail.

256
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,478
I can print it out for you.

257
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,910
They never wrote or called
to check on the status?

258
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,429
No. Trust me, lady,
I've been working

259
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,234
for the county a long time.
I know how to cover my ass.

260
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,590
You kept cashing Darnell's cheques
after he left.

261
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,598
How're you gonna cover your ass
on that one?

262
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,959
My wife handles the books.

263
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,875
We get a lot of cheques
for these kids. It's hard
to know the difference.

264
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,559
We caught the mistake
last month.

265
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,672
Sent them an e-mail to bill us.

266
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,916
You don't seem too broken up
Darnell took off.

267
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,157
FRANK:
Darnell was uncontrollable.

268
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,917
Belonged in a hospital
or a prison, not my house.

269
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,393
Sounds like your closet
therapy didn't take, huh?

270
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,193
Child endangerment's a crime.

271
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,470
RAWLING:
Consider your
foster care licence gone.

272
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,359
How hard we press charges?
That's in your court.

273
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,149
When was the last time
you saw Darnell?

274
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,713
Couple weeks ago.

275
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,992
Caught him in the house
when he thought Liz and I were gone.

276
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,033
Stealing groceries,
other kids' prescriptions.

277
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,196
DUTCH:
Any idea where he went after that?

278
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,790
Try his mom. She's a junkie.

279
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,433
Him too, probably.

280
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:36,389
Only meds he didn't take were the
ones that actually might help him.

281
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,555
RAWLING:
The dad reported
Darnell Garry left months ago.

282
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,593
How come someone didn't file
a missing person's report with us?

283
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,308
There's no record of him
being missing.

284
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,988
This is a copy
of the e-mail he sent you.

285
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,191
He's been gone for three months.

286
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,393
How many visits have you had
there since then?

287
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,988
Two.

288
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,475
And you didn't notice that
one of the kids was missing?

289
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,877
Cheques were never stopped. Darnell
was never flagged for a follow-up.

290
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,992
You know who ends up doing
that follow-up? My cops or the ME.

291
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,913
Half these kids are gonna
end up in the penal system.
They're time bombs.

292
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,078
We shuffle them around from
place to place, lose track of them...

293
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,508
until they explode.

294
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,870
Look, I'm here as a courtesy.

295
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,640
If you wanna lecture
about the foster care system,

296
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,637
teach an extension
class at UCLA.

297
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,876
You know, I understand
the difficulties and limitations.

298
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,799
I deal with my own,
but we have got to do better.

299
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,831
No, you mean
I've got to do better.

300
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,308
If we got a missing teen,

301
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,080
stop taking it out on me
and do something to find him.

302
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,238
In Domestic, I had to watch
you people on a daily basis.

303
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,750
I saw more concern
for filling federally funded beds

304
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,598
than in helping
reunite families.

305
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,509
We've got tens of thousands
of kids to care for.

306
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,154
This is one mistake.
This is a kid.

307
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,875
So is the one in the hospital
with half a throat.

308
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,799
You don't like my job performance,
call my supervisor.

309
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,230
Fine. I'll explain
why you've been arrested.

310
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,318
Hey, for what?
Negligence, child endangerment.

311
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,438
You were assigned to that
household, so I'm holding
you responsible. Officer, take him.

312
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,709
SANDERSEN:
You gotta be kidding me.

313
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,319
What's she doing?
RAWLING: Hey!

314
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,352
Standing on her soapbox.

315
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:09,109
She have her own
or you let her borrow yours?

316
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,109
[###]

317
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,388
VASCO:
What's the problem, officer?

318
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,034
Your plates are expired, Illinois.

319
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,468
Licence, registration.

320
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,474
You boys are enjoying the party.
I smell marijuana.

321
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,717
All right, get out of the car.
Step out now, all of you. Move it.

322
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,518
VASCO:
Come on,
we just seeing the sights.

323
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,473
DANNY:
Put your hands on top of your head
and turn around.

324
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,955
JULIEN: Come on, step forward.
DANNY: Boys affiliated?

325
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,037
VASCO: What?
Gang ink. You got any?

326
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,719
Hey.

327
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,036
Eighth street. What is that,
your Boy Scout troop?

328
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,630
We ain't got no business here.
We just visiting my cousin, that's it.

329
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,590
I'll let your cousin know
when your visiting hours are.

330
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,439
Danny.

331
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,954
DANNY:
Hey, Vic.

332
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,833
I think we got your new
official department issue ride.

333
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,029
Oh!
DANNY: Chicago homeboys

334
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,639
with too much narcotics.

335
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:04,515
You make that stick,
those tickets are all yours.

336
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,473
Oh, leather seats.
Fully loaded.

337
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,797
For you, I'll even throw in dinner.

338
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,308
[PEOPLE CHATTERING
INDISTINCTLY]

339
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,719
VIC:
What happened?

340
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,230
OCU sat on Kozi cabs for two hours.
Half the Russian mob showed.

341
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,557
Kozodav didn't. Sullivan
made the call to go in anyway.

342
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,795
Kozodav's in the wind?

343
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,592
Yeah, well, Sullivan
said he had no choice.

344
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,836
A residential building
is about to be torched.

345
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,430
He figured he'd press the soldiers,
use them to give Kozodav's location.

346
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,835
Well, they're all asking for lawyers.

347
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,553
Monica got you up to speed?

348
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,638
She gave me the ABC's.
Good. We need your help.

349
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,792
I'll get my team together,
start digging into Kozodav's haunts.

350
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,228
PHILLIPS:
Not for field work.

351
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,912
What do you want my man for?
To help transcribe video tapes.

352
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,639
You oversaw the operation.

353
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,549
If there's any clue to Kozodav's
whereabouts, we need to know.

354
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,552
Where are you going?

355
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,833
Every second I stay here,
Kozodav gets further away.

356
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,439
My boss just gave you an order.

357
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,788
Follow it.

358
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,388
VIC:
You got a minute?

359
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,990
Building full of people is about
ready to burn down, a minute's
about all I got.

360
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,191
Look, I know this church tape
is a problem for you.

361
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,072
But, I should be the
one looking for this guy.

362
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,554
It's OCU's case.

363
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,070
Hey, we've got years, Roy.
Something's up.

364
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,874
All I'm asking
is to shoot me straight.

365
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,433
Whatever you did to piss
off Aceveda? It worked.

366
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,557
He's got leverage with chief
and he's using it.

367
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,797
I'm keeping my nose clean,
I'm doing what I'm told. I'm delivering.

368
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,992
Yeah, you've been doing good lately,
but you got a damaged jacket.

369
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,033
I'm fixing that.
Do yourself and your family a favour.

370
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,437
Whatever you need to do
to make sure Rawling succeeds, do it.

371
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,272
Because the shot
she's giving you,

372
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,472
it may be the last one
you've got in this department.

373
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,514
CLAUDETTE:
We're looking for your son.

374
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,755
Darnell?

375
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,558
You Child Services?
No, we're police.

376
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,832
There was an incident at Darnell's
foster home. He may be a witness.

377
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,555
Whatever it was, he probably did it.
CLAUDETTE: Why'd you say that?

378
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,353
That boy's no good.

379
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,358
Comes around, steals my stuff,
sells it for drug money.

380
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,596
RAWLING: Where does he score?
All over.

381
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,230
I can tell you how he earns his pay.
CLAUDETTE: He's got a job?

382
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,708
Just blowjobs.

383
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,199
He sucks fag dick
on 4th Street.

384
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,953
Tell him I said hey.

385
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,192
I didn't mess with Joya
or make her drink anything.

386
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,557
We'd love to take your word for it
but we're gonna take a DNA sample,

387
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,115
compare it with the semen
we found, just in case.

388
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,072
I ain't giving you
permission for that.

389
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,078
Frank is still technically
your legal guardian.

390
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,233
We have your permission?
Of course.

391
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,156
I may have done some shit.

392
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,275
But what about him? You ain't
gonna let him go free, are you?

393
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,708
DUTCH:
So you did rape Joya?

394
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,229
DARNELL:
You see what I gotta do
on the street to survive.

395
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,677
When am I gonna get me some?
When am I gonna get to bust a nut?

396
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,154
She's 7.

397
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,679
I hope you fry.

398
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,553
This is his fault.
Locking us up in a closet and shit!

399
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,718
A few minutes
to calm you down, you animal!

400
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,480
More like hours!
Sit down.

401
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,191
DARNELL:
He called it the hole.

402
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,597
Put the oldest one in charge,
make them keep order.

403
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:42,268
Little ones in there crying
and wailing for hours in that closet.

404
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,349
And as for the Drano,
that ain't me.

405
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,272
Sounds like Bibi trying
to keep the peace

406
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,119
so she don't get locked up
in Frank's hole.

407
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,952
SHANE: We need to get Ernesto
to admit that he's selling the
cigarettes across state lines.

408
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,794
But let him say it.
Don't get overeager,
tip your hat.

409
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,719
Don't worry about it, bro.
He thinks of me like a brother.

410
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,512
He won't see nothing coming.

411
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,315
Before I went away,
I banged his 14 year-old sister.

412
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,272
Took her virginity.

413
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,038
Fool didn't have a clue.

414
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,879
Told him I was helping her
with her history homework.

415
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,712
Try the history
of popping cherries.

416
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,876
Why don't you keep it
to yourself, man?

417
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,479
What's your problem, superstar?

418
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,955
If there's grass on the field,
you gotta play ball, right?

419
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,549
Hey, cut it out, man. Cut it out.
LEM: Guy's a dick.

00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,115
Yeah, well he's my CI
Okay, this is my run.

421
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,637
So just follow my orders.

422
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,876
First one is to give him
and me a little room.

423
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,278
Okay?

00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,430
All right, showtime,

ERNESTO [ON RADIO]:
Garcia called with the drop point

426
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,518
for the goods.

Doing good, bro.

428
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,392
There's more where this came from
when the smokes get to St. Louis?

429
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,591
Told you not to push it,
you skid mark.

430
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,916
Should've emphasized
the point.

431
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,515
ERNESTO:
Relax. Enough business.

[WHISTLES]

433
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,478
Got you a present
for all your hard work.

434
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,870
Puta's all dressed up
with no one to blow.

Mami's gonna mak e papi happy.

436
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,917
RAWLING:
I looked into the video tape.

437
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,550
the woman who shot it,
her nephew works at
Antwon Mitchell's rec centre.

438
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,354
You think Antwon edited the tape?
Sent it to the press?

439
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,950
I know it's not an accurate depiction
of what happened there.

440
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,839
Help me bury this.

441
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,838
I know the press.
You can't unring this bell.

442
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,873
I'll be handing these seizure cases
over to the police committee.

443
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,433
The rest seem fine.

444
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,518
I also looked into the crime stats.

445
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,995
The numbers are up
because you manipulated yours

446
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,111
to make things look better.

447
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,595
I'm getting punished because
I reported mine accurately.

448
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,395
Sounds to me like now's a good time
to start formulating an exit strategy
for this seizure policy.

449
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,114
The only person who could
take me off this is the chief.

450
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,356
And not without
one hell of a fight from me.

451
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,199
Well, then, I'd start training.
I just spoke to him.

452
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,868
He's still blue in the face from having
to explain to the ACLU lawyers

453
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,629
why you put a cop like Vic in charge
of such a controversial programme.

454
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,472
That's what all this is about.

455
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,308
Mackey.

456
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,637
Starting tonight,
Vic's the face of that church invasion.

457
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,599
Pulling him off the street
might buy you some slack.

458
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:35,156
He's working. I stand by my choice.

459
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,398
You just won't take help, will you?
Help from you? Sure.

460
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,478
Orders, no.

461
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,798
If Mackey's off the table,

462
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,276
I'm gonna have to set my sights
on the policy in general.

463
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,751
That was an illegal U-turn, right?
DANNY: That's right.

464
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,474
I'm sorry.
I don't know this part of town too well.

465
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,996
And I've been looking for 5 Freeway
for like 20 minutes and in the rain,
it's brutal.

00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,872
DANNY: It sucks, doesn't it?
MAN: Yeah, it does.

DANNY:
Let me see your licence
and registration, please.

469
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,272
Right.
That an open container?

470
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,959
No. It's corked.

00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,077
JULIEN:
It's been opened.
That's illegal.

472
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,799
It's from lunch.

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,877
Dude, it's a $400 bottle of Pomerol.

474
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,957
I wasn't gonna leave it
for the busboys.

475
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,878
Get out, please.

476
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,719
I had a glass of wine with a client
like three hours ago.

477
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,673
Man, I'm not impaired.
I said out of the car, sir.

00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,157
All right. Do it?
All right. You heard the officer.

479
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,510
Come on, get out of the car.

480
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,190
Step to the back of the car.

481
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,992
Step up against
the car, please.

00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:44,071

You intend to sell these?

483
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,909
No, it's for me.
Guy on Olvera sells them cheap.

484
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,395
You affiliated?
What?

485
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,710
With a gang. I see the ink.

486
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,876
Pull up your shirt.
What's your deal, man?

487
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,235
Get your hands off...
Hey.

00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,079
Ow! Aah! Back off, man!
Take it easy.

00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,072
I'm sorry.
