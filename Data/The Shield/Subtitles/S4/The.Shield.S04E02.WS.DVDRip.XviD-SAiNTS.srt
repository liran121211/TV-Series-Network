00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,879
I got two ex-wives, five kids.

177
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,996
I can't mak e a living with
you guys perpetually up my ass.

178
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,235
Maybe Mackey couldn't figure out
how you were end-running us, but I did.

179
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,237
You tipped off big-fish clients.

180
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,000
They gave you seed money
to start a new company.

181
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,869
You got your income back,
they got a new place to launder cash.

182
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,149
Jesus...

183
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,757
how'd you miss this?

184
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,791
I'll give you
more names.

185
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,278
From the new business.

186
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,112
Bigger guys.

187
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,989
I don't think so, Lewis.
It's over.

188
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,310
And now you're going to jail.

189
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,998
[SIGHS]

190
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,757
Six months and thousands
of tax dollars pissed away.

191
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,678
At least now we know why.

192
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,908
I dropped the ball.

193
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,031
Little late
for the humble-servant routine.

194
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,038
I'll set up the collars on the ones
we have, make sure it gets done right.

195
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,390
Oh, and you're the man
to do it right?

196
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,558
Just let him fix
the problem, okay?

197
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,354
Sir, there are two people dead
at that laundromat robbery.

198
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,717
One of them's
an officer-involved shooting.

199
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,069
Shit. What do we know?

200
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,430
Two suspects. Looks like
a Hispanic male and a white female.

201
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,071
Do we have a description
of the shooters?

202
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,555
Just the girl, she's one of the DOAs.

203
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,957
Blond, pierced nose, 120 pounds.

204
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,192
What?

205
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,631
This shooting might have something
to do with the kid that I'm looking for.

206
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,677
Your wayward juvie's
tied in with a 187?

207
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,270
If you're trying to win me over,
it's not working.

208
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,831
Little Bonnie and Clyde
shot and killed the manager
for $11 in quarters.

209
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,995
The boy got away.

210
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,838
You pull a name and address
on the girl?

211
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,519
Hope Anthony. 9246 East Olympic.

212
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,073
Goddamn it.

213
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,235
Problem?

214
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,317
You got that Xerox picture
of Cyril on you?

215
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,715
DANNY: Yeah.
Run it by the witnesses.

216
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,430
Hey, I, uh, think the other shooter's
this kid I've been looking for.

217
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,313
Unbelievable. Putting cops at risk
by running this off the grid?

218
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,509
I didn't have all the facts...

219
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,392
Well, at least you're consistent.

220
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,352
Give information
on the kid to Billings

221
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,312
and finish closing out
the Garage Sting.

222
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,993
It sounded like you had something
more you wanted to share up there.

223
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,792
What if I did? Who are you?

224
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,195
Captain Rawling.
Aceveda's on his way out.

225
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,550
I'll be deciding
what happens in the Barn.

226
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:01,550
Well, I got a name will spin
your pretty little head around.

227
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,076
Well, my pretty little head
doesn't spin that easy.

228
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,235
Who is it?

229
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,590
I want my deal back in place.

230
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,597
No jail time.

231
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,593
That deal got flushed
with your corporate switcheroo.

232
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,756
You gotta put something real
on the table,

233
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,349
or the DA won't even take my call.

234
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,758
No deal, no name.

235
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,556
No problem then.

236
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,874
There he is.
Yeah.

237
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,719
It's me.
I just messengered you a package.

238
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,632
Is it ticking?
Sort of.

239
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,917
It's a class-action lawsuit against
Pyren Merril Pharmaceutical Company.

240
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,473
What's that got to do with us?

241
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:46,559
Well, it claims that the rise in autism
is due to a vaccine preservative.

242
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,115
Vaccines that both Matthew
and Megan got when they were 2.

243
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,436
Well, that was right around when...
I know. I know.

244
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,478
There's a deadline. We need
to sit down, talk with the lawyer.

245
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,319
Okay. How about tomorrow morning
when I drop off Cassy?

246
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,475
Great. I'll set it up,

247
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,989
and I will see you then. Bye.

248
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,592
Armando Renta, this is Vic Mackey.
Good to meet you.

249
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,155
Army's fresh off a 14-month roll
in Shock and Awe.

250
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,193
Gave those sand pigs a little taste
of the red, white and brown.

251
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,635
Mission accomplished?
That's what they told us.

252
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,193
So it must be true.

253
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,549
How you like running with Wild Bill?

254
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,512
Beats going door to door
in Baghdad.

255
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,676
Now it's hick and the spic.

256
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,039
That's clever.
Can you give us a minute?

257
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,678
So, um, what's up?

258
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,954
We need to know who's running crack
in Ashmore Heights these days.

259
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,754
That's hard to say. Last few weeks,
someone's flooded the market.

260
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,032
Every pusher in the hood's rock-heavy,
scrambling to unload product.

261
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,196
Since when do you need help
powder tracking?

262
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,879
You hear about Gilroy?

263
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,075
What, is he back in town?

264
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,748
Yeah, spilling his guts
at the morgue.

265
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,188
Drank himself to death.

266
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,755
They're gonna bury him tomorrow,
you should be there.

267
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,279
I wanted the guy dead.

268
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,198
Well, you got your wish.

269
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,636
This is about his wife and kids now.

270
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,230
You forgetting he threatened
your family? He hung you out to IAD?

271
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,795
Money and pussy
make man do evil shit.

272
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,878
But before all that,
he was a friend.

273
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,032
Some bodies in blue
should show respect.

274
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,880
I'll see if I can
shake myself free.

275
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,434
So we, uh, done?

276
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,517
I, uh...

277
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,992
I got some worries about what I saw
over at Dead-Eye's the other night.

278
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,349
Well, stop worrying.

279
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,755
Dead-Eye was about to start
C.I. duties for me.

280
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,633
Tracking Antwon Mitchell's new game,
until someone tapped his mute button.

281
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,951
Now I'm watching Antwon.

282
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,038
So if you got
any kind of relationship...

283
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,117
I got no relationship with him.

284
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,516
Then I got no problem.

285
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,358
ARMANDO:
Everything cool?

286
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,229
Yeah, it's all good. You ready?

287
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,153
It's gonna take two, maybe three days
to lay a new piece of pipe.

288
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,238
Get started.
I wanna hear flushing in 48 hours.

289
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,395
What's going on?

290
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,874
Having the men's room repaired.

291
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:57,034
I didn't fix the men's room
'cause it would've chewed up
35% of our budget.

292
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,759
That's my worry now.

293
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,235
Plumbing crews, cameras.

294
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,398
Either you're completely naïve
about our financial constraints,

295
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,830
which I doubt,
or you've got something planned.

296
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,828
I'm instituting seizures...
across the board:

297
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,112
cars, houses, businesses.
Anything drug or gang-related.

298
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,753
Asset forfeiture?
The chief will never go...

299
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,279
It's already signed on.

300
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,748
Pol Com too.

301
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,394
Citizens here can't afford lawyers
to fight seized assets.

302
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,477
He's not worried
about pissing off dealers

303
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,272
'cause we swiped
their pimp rides.

304
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,391
We're gonna target
the right people.

305
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,273
And you're thinking of
using Mackey for this?

306
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,959
[SCOFFS]

307
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,470
I'm still deciding.
I mean, your letter
made him untradeable.

308
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,669
I have to use him somewhere.

309
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,074
Keep him parked inside.

310
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,271
Anything else is dangerous.
Trust me.

311
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,708
Appreciate your input.

312
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,911
MAN:
I need a signature to start the work.

313
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,151
ACEVEDA:
So why is this the first
I'm hearing about all this?

314
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,590
Oh, it happened fast. Thanks.

315
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:57,356
Anyway, after tomorrow
it's mine to win or lose.

316
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,310
She was unconscious when they
brought her in. Fishnets, spandex.

317
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,397
I don't think
she was out walking her dog.

318
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,828
Hooker rape?

319
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,554
The name she put on her form
is Olive Martini.

320
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,271
This is the only thing
that she had on her.

321
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,839
Ralph's card. That's official.

322
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,189
She's in 6.

323
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,755
I'll go see if she's shaken or stirred.

324
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,274
Oh, you know what? Test results aren't
gonna be in until this afternoon.

325
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,199
I usually, uh, grab a taco
across the street.

326
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,355
From Rullio's?

327
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,358
We treat at least four cases of food
poisoning a week from that place.

328
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,152
It got an A in the window.

329
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,315
Stands for acute gastritis.

330
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,714
CLAUDETTE:
Did you say Room 6?

331
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,672
Olive has left the building.

332
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,158
DUTCH:
Okay.

333
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,834
James has got a family friend,
thinks you two would hit it off.

334
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,268
Really?

335
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,277
She does public-affairs work. Smart.

336
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,794
For some reason,
she likes cops.

337
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,035
What's she look like?

338
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,993
Petite, dark-skinned, attractive.

339
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,199
She black?

340
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,118
Never mind.

341
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,759
What?

342
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,520
l... I dated a black girl in college.

343
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,598
Quarter black.
I mean, you could definitely tell.

344
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,196
Forget it. What's on the raped
