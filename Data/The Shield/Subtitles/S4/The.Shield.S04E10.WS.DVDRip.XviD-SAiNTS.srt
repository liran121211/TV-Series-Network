with you today.

two cops get murdered,

00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,597
Could be Carl and Scooby
making bad jokes about us.

You found them, huh?

Yeah.
Did they?

You know, were they...?
I don't think they suffered much.

180
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,633
Really?

181
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,715
I heard it was pretty bad.

182
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,993
They had each been stabbed
several times.

183
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,553
But they had been moved
from another scene,

184
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,597
so the blood was minimal.

You know what? On second
thought, I don't wanna know.

186

Yeah.

Screwing you wasn't his
only indiscretion, was it?

He planted that blow in my car

203
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,271
and trumped up
those trafficking charges.

204
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,829
Because just like you all,
he had shit on me.

00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,191
Kleavon's logged more
hours in interrogation
than the two of us.

00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,118
He's guilty.

286

He's not gonna crack unless he's
under some serious pressure.

Well, the M.E.'s initial report

00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,755

For gas.

292
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:18,352
If Kleavon thinks that girl's alive,
he'd know she could ID him.

293
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,916
He might want a deal.
If we offer one, he'll smell weakness.

294
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,669
Then we gotta get him to ask
for one. Let me get a run at it.

295

He's got a thing
for us black girls.

Then do it. Get me out of here.

306

Last time you were here,
you were so calm

307
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,838
because you were innocent.

308
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,716
What's different about tonight?
Out of patience.

309
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:13,117
Seems like every time somebody shits
around here, y'all smell my ass.

Witnesses put you at
the scene. You sure you
didn't leave your house?

311
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,548
Went out for soda.
You changed your story.

312
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:25,358
You were watching the game
or you went out? Which is it?

never convicted, never on probation.

Look, I'm sorry
that girl got her neck wrung.

316
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,911
It ain't my problem.

317
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,997
He wasn't gone long,
not more than five, 10 minutes.

318
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,192
Barely long enough
to get the sodas.

319
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,676
We have two witnesses who saw him
attack this girl. They chased him off.

320
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,148
They're wrong.

321
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:56,433
He has a habit of being in the
vicinity of murdered black girls.

322
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,790
That's what
the San Antonio police said.

323
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,956
And they've convinced you
of the same thing.

324
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,197
I know it's hard to believe this
of your own brother.

325
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,470
FATIMA:
Kleavon is not a killer.

326
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,917
If he was, I'm his sister.
Believe me, I'd know it.

327
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,671
We had a woman in here last year
whose husband was a serial rapist.

328
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,438
She had no idea.

329
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,760
He said he was at work, even took
a job that suited his other career.

330
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,117
I don't think she really even
believed it when he confessed.

331
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,311
Then I'll pray for her.

332

got busted, we...

Tried to tip him about that?
No.

688
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:30,468
But after it went down, Army and I
figured that the girl going missing

689
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,272
was his way
of sending a message.

690

after him alone?

00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,029

about the drug warehouse.

prints, but also for a surer grip.
