1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,436
CARL:
Wait. Then the guy was just screaming,
so I look down,

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,791
and I see in his hand
his nipple ring and his nipple.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,228
[LAUGHTER]

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,670
It's all true.
Fortunately, the guy was drunk.

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,598
DANNY:
Yeah, but sooner or later,
you sober up,

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,597
and you're still
missing your nipple.

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,232
DANNY:
How'd you guys log that
into evidence anyway?

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,435
Oh, shit, with gloves on.

9
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,029
[LAUGHTER]

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,719
I'll be in the car.

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,233
Thought he got benched?

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,755
His PBA rep appealed,
he's on the street till the hearing.

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,474
CARL:
He's pissing a lot a lot of people
off, not being onboard with the captain.

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,398
DANNY:
Come on, he's got a right
to take a stand.

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,953
He's also got the right
to remain silent.

16
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,309
Okay.
You with me, Scoob?

17
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,509
SCOOBY:
Damn straight.

18
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,029
WOMAN [OVER RADIO]:
1-Tango-17, 242 just occurred.

19
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,508
762 Whitney Avenue, code two.

20
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,039
[MAN GROANS]
DANNY: Talk to you later.

21
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,071
Yeah, I guess
second roll call's over.

22
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,149
[CHUCKLES]
Yeah.

23
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,920
Look, you had a gun
to his head. He's gonna tell you
anything you wanna hear.

24
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,075
It wasn't like that.

25
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,872
How can you know what's in his mind?

26
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,789
If Shane wasn't telling me the truth,
you trust me,
things would've gone down differently.

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,274
He was never coming after me.

28
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,994
He's been lying to us for months,
leaking all that intel to Antwon.

29
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,428
He didn't get Angie killed.

30
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,995
Her own mother gave her up to Antwon
before she OD'd.

31
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,317
He had to watch Antwon shoot her
for chrissakes. He's sick about it.

32
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,069
Yeah, so sick all he's worried about
is covering his own ass.

33
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,078
I told him he has to
come clean with everything
that happened with Antwon.

34
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,952
Will that buy him some trust?

35
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,354
We should hear him out.

36
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,232
Boys.

37
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,234
SHANE:
And once he had us on the hook
for Angie, he twisted us pretty hard.

38
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,394
You've already seen the highlights.

39
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,433
And after that, everything else
seemed like small potatoes.

40
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,676
We tipped off the El Salvadorans
in that church raid.

41
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,872
Muled some China White
from San Pedro to L.A.

42
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,436
Antwon was pretty pissed off you
took down those drug dens of his.

43
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,234
And to help ease the pain,
we busted his competitors,

44
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,635
you know,
gave him half the product.

45
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,114
And that's most of it.

46
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,073
Antwon have any relationships
I should know about?

47
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,272
Not many that work.
Beaners hate his ass.

48
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,313
El Salvadorans are losing faith.
ROC, they ignore him.

49
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,835
Asians tolerate him.

50
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,032
Outside the brothers,
he ain't too popular.

51
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,119
These injunctions and seizures
are hitting him harder
than he wants folks to know.

52
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,912
That's why he needed me.

53
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,599
LEM:
What about Army?

54
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,631
He follows my lead.

55
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,637
So he won't blind-side us?

56
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,513
No, no, he's down.

57
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,236
Look, I'm sorry about that little girl.

58
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,229
But it's not too late to get her back,
to give her a proper burial.

59
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,310
So basically you need
our help. Right?

60
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,397
He came clean.

61
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,311
Now, it's time for us to do our part.

62
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,679
ARMY: What?
SHANE: I told them everything.

63
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,279
What everything?
All of it.

64
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,590
How about bouncing that shit off me?
I don't know these guys.

65
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,717
Well, I do.
And we can't handle this alone.

66
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,672
All right. Banger spotters
are there around the clock.

67
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,992
Lost souls usually shuffle in after dark.
Place closes down around midnight.

68
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,873
Find an excuse to roust them out,
bring them to the Barn.

69
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,877
They're One-Niners,
we'll just bust them.

70
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,479
How are you planning
on get Angie's body?

71
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,393
We wait till it's dark. I just don't
know how deep she's buried.

72
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,797
If they planned on having the shithouse
on top, probably not very deep.

73
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,115
We dig her up,
extract our bullets.

74
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,390
Find a really good place to bury her.

75
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,273
Once we have the girl's body, Antwon
doesn't have anymore leverage.

76
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,311
We go at him hard,
put him away for good.

77
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,312
Or we shoot him for resisting.

78
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,635
This is bullshit, man.

79
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,512
Or we can do this,
just the four of us.

80
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,597
No. He's good.
Don't worry. Let's go.

81
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,274
WOMAN [OVER RADIO]:
1-Tango-13, roger.

82
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:45,359
Respond to 4556 Alexandria Circle,
Apartment 7.

83
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,791
1-Tango-17 has been code six
on a domestic dispute for a while now.

84
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,035
And not responding.

85
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,719
JULIEN:
Roger, this is 1 -Tango-13.

86
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,672
We're on the scene.

87
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,916
DANNY:
Ma'am, are you the one
that made the 911 call?

88
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,315
Yeah, but I told them other cops
they missed him.

89
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,476
How long ago
did the other officers come by?

90
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,119
About a half hour ago.

91
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,275
Why'd you call?

92
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,435
Gideon Mazell,

93
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,312
my ex's kid,
he was trying to break in.

94
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,748
Said he was gonna rape me.

95
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,838
Asshole's been trying to get at me
since I dumped his old man.

96
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,917
Did you see where the other officers
went after they left here?

97
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,758
WOMAN:
Figured they went
looking for Gideon.

98
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,154
JULIEN:
I have to take a look.

99
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,679
1 -Tango-17, you copy?

100
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,117
Carl, Scooby,
you guys on foot?

101
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,195
Anything?

102
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,389
Canvassed the whole area.
There's nothing.

103
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,555
RAWLING:
Shit.

104
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,034
JULIEN:
Half the people
weren't answering their door.

105
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,515
The other half were sleeping.

106
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,392
Use your radio.

107
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,478
Staff, 9-Tango.
I'm code six on Alexandria Circle.

108
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,910
Be advised we have
two officers unaccounted for,

109
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,678
requesting a tac alert.

110
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,399
All watches will be held over.

111
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,635
WOMAN:
Copy that.

112
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,068
We should notify the families.

113
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,515
Carl and Scooby have been missing
at least an hour.

114
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,278
I'm on my way over there right now.

115
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,675
Could be the same hunt.
Antwon sending a message.

116
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,472
Well, if that's true,
they aren't just missing.

117
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,511
Retribution for not killing
the cop he wanted.

118
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,392
Yeah, we know where he likes
to bury bodies.

119
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,555
Jesus Christ.

120
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,957
All right. You, Army and Ronnie
stick to the plan.

121
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,310
Find our missing cops.
We also gotta get a 20 on Antwon.

122
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,590
So we can scoop him up
soon as we find the girl's body.

123
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,075
You come with me.
Let's go.

124
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,153
Want you to go to the end
of the block and keep knocking
till you wake people up.

125
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,078
JULIEN: Yes, ma'am.
CLAUDETTE: Where do you want us?

126
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,238
We're tracking down Gideon Mazell,
he's the subject of the 911 calls.

127
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,954
Steve Billings is on his way down,
so pass on to him what you find.

128
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,391
Captain, Steve's good at what he does.
But we've got officers missing.

129
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:31,276
If they're alive, they won't be for long,
and your best detectives are here now.

130
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,950
You haven't seen our best game
because of the whole DA thing.
This is too important.

131
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,030
Okay, you're the primaries.

132
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,549
We'll contact the sheriff.
See if they can loan us
some bloodhounds.

133
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,113
Tracking Gideon Mazell.

134
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,515
No, Danny talked to the woman
he was threatening.

135
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,280
So you guys get together. Vic and
his people can work the gang angle.

136
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,038
DUTCH: Where is she?
DANNY: Number 7, upstairs.

137
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,312
Julien, I want you to be
department liaison. Sit with Carl's wife.

138
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,677
I heard what happened.
I wanna help.

139
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,110
Tonight your reserve duty?

140
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,231
No. But I'm still part of this family.

141
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,317
Who can I ride with?

142
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,549
I'll see who's available.

143
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,228
Captain, I knew both those guys.
I should be out there looking for them.

144
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,317
Well, I'm comfortable
if you're at Carl's house.

145
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,710
I don't have time to worry
about whether you'll follow orders.

146
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,795
Danny, I want you to take Aceveda
on patrol with you.

147
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,558
If there are problems,
I wanna hear about it.

148
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,749
Absolutely.

149
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,995
You eve consider this might be
Antwon Mitchell's work?

150
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,189
It's his hood, isn't it?

151
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,879
Yeah, I sent some unis
to pick him up.

152
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,672
Call them back.
I'm all over it. He's MIA.

153
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,313
With our two cops,
that's convenient.

154
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,509
Give me those unis.

155
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,109
I'll sweep up some of his crew,
maybe find Antwon or our guys.

156
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,912
I can only spare
a couple of bodies.

157
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,874
Look, if I wasn't put in
the backseat on this, I could've
stopped this from happening.

158
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,354
You did what you had to do.
I know that.

159
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,199
I just wanna find these guys.

160
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,833
Okay. I'll have Zerkow call them back,
assign them to you.

161
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,995
Appreciate that.

162
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,156
I'd like to help out.
You got any gaps here?

163
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,351
Yeah, check with Dutch and Claudette.
They're over there.

164
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,311
We wanna talk to Antwon.
Yo, he ain't here.

165

00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,711
No witnesses,
but we're waiting for lab work.

673
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,117
So that's the plan? We just get lucky,
something falls in our laps?

674
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,429
DUTCH:
It's only the first day.

675
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,073
RAWLING:
Every day will just get harder.

676
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:21,477
Meanwhile, I've had
four different squad cars shot at.

677
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,353
Two brawls with civilians
and officers, and one instance

678
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,875
in which my own men lost control.

679
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,593
It's gotta stop.

680
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,949
Vic and his guys have brought
in a suspect.

681
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,270
Great. What do we have on him?

682
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,119
Carload of stolen guns.

683
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,072
Our guys were stabbed.

684
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,395
He's a gang member,
we've got him on weapons charges.

685
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,511
But nothing related to our murders?

686
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,996
I want you to make the press believe
that we have a killer in custody.

687
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,475
Oh, you're kidding me.
You want us to lie?

688
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:58,116
Save your high and mighties for when
the lives of my cops aren't at stake.

689
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,713
You've had a chance to solve this.

690
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,035
It's only been one day.

691
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,470
And you've been doing your best,
but we're not far enough.

692
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,597
You tell the community
that we have a killer,

693
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,349
it sends a message that there's
a price to pay for coming after us.

694
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:13,394
Makes whoever really did it cocky,
gets them laughing with their friends

695
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,716
about what idiots we are,
and if they tell their friends...

696
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,478
Their friends tell someone
who tells us.

697
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:21,989
You wanted the case.
So take the bad with the good.

698
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,349
ANTWON:
So five-0 was waiting for me at LAX?

699
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,752
How's this an improvement?

700
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,394
My little gift to you,
running interference.

701
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,592
I didn't know
I made your Christmas list.

702
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,430
We want a truce.

703
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,955
You know there's a much bigger upside
for you, me being alive and kicking.

704
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,428
I don't see it.

705
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:00,791
Truth is, my captain's made
a serious dent in your business.

706
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,069
How long before someone

707
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,397
in your organization decides
to play king of the hill?

708
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,238
Nobody's taking me down.

709
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,509
Not without my backing.

710
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,712
You been stepping on my game
since day one.

711
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,276
That earns you dead.

712
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,708
Yeah, that didn't happen.

713
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,399
My boys saw you gaffing me up
at the airport, so...

714
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,756
Now, what?

715
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:48,749
You back off me and mine,
Shane and his family.

716
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,157
We work out fair percentages,
you get to do business uninterrupted.

717
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,555
That's the deal.

718
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,037
Either you smoking crack,
or you think I am.

719
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,789
Our captain pulled him off lead on the
gang task force. He lost his pay bump.

720
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,639
There's no upside for me to play
by their rules anymore.

721
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,229
I got two sick kids. I gotta earn.

722
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:14,070
And I ain't got time to hear no more
of this crackerwood bullshit.

723
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,758
Look, I know you've been looking
for a new tar importer

724
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:22,238
ever since you lost that cul-de-sac,
the El Salvadorans.

725
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,835
VIC:
I got a hookup
with a Jamaican crew out of Miami.

726
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,237
They call themselves
the Splash Posse.

727
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,953
Yeah, I heard of them niggas.

728
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,594
They're looking to move weight out
of the West Coast.

729
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,314
I'm their broker.

730
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,272
We need a retail outlet.

731
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,195
So you a... baller all
of a sudden now, huh?

732
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,470
Always was.

733
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,156
But I just took a step back
from the game for a little while.

734
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,793
So, what's your captain
gonna sweat me on, huh?

735
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,349
These dead cops?

736
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:00,152
I don't kill for no reason.

737
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:03,238
And I don't know nothing
about mercing no police.

738
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,510
SHANE:
They got nothing on you.

739
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:09,269
They'll hold you for a few hours,
then cut you loose.

740
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,959
I'll be in the room.

741
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,749
I'll steer the questioning away
from anything sensitive.

742
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,270
That is, if we're working together.

743
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:26,230
You lucky your boy
got mad love for you.

744
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,874
Yeah.

745
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,350
We're all about mad love.

[CHUCKLES]

747
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,992
The suspect's name
is Donzell Prince.

748
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,192
And you've arrested him
for the murders
of Officers Haimes and Miller?

749
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,551
DUTCH:
He's being held on weapon charges,
but we're confident we have our man.

750
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,591
MAN:
If you're so confident,
why don't you file on murder?

751
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,553
Because we don't wanna
make any mistakes.
No one wants to take any chances.

752
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,113
MAN 2:
Do you believe
he acted alone?

753
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,676
Doesn't the crime itself suggest
that there were multiple assailants?

754
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,553
I really can't go into our theory
of the crime at this time.

755
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,830
Has the suspect indicated
any accomplices?

756
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,838
I can't talk about the specifics
of what the suspect revealed.

757
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,679
All I can say is
our investigation is bearing fruit.

758
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,348
And we'll have more for you
in the coming days. Thank you.

Could you tell us
what lead you to Mr. Prince?

[REPORTERS CHATTERING]

761
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,073
Danny, bring him up to 1.
DANNY: Sure.

762
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,395
We frisked him, he's clean.

763
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,874
All right.

764
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,595
He gave us the slip at LAX.

765
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,279
How'd you find him?

766
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,357
One of his crew told us
he got a heads-up.

767
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,676
Only had one of two choices
left, Burbank or L.B.

768
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,074
We got him at Bob Hope.

769
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,235
Nice.

770
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,839
Don't know what we're gonna
throw at him yet.

00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,712

up my sleeve.

00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,436

00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,157

for 12 hours.
