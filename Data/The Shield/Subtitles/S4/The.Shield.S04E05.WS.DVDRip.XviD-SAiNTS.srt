For every dealer and banger we put
in jail, three more take his place.

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,353
It's because the culture of wealth that's
been created by the sale of drugs

has sent a very clear message
to our kids: "Now hiring."

will make it harder to do business.

Excuse me. So you don't
believe in rehabilitation?

103

What you're saying is the police
can change, but a brother can't?

104
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:10,797
Rehabilitation presumes that
a person's behaviour has changed.

00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,557
When someone is arrested,

120
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,832
the law says innocent
until proven guilty.

121
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,674
The reason for that
is people make mistakes.

122
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,629

that burden falls on you, sir.

123
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,871
And you, and you.

00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,198
To prove that you didn't buy
your house by selling contraband.

125
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,996
Otherwise, they can take your property,
sell it to the highest bidder.

126
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,428
And they keep the money.

127
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,394

into neighbourhood programmes

128
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,352
and into making
this community safer.

00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,711

that this policy has been tried.

131
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,876
Which is why I cannot support it
without strict regulations.

You're trying to fix something
that isn't broken.

No. No, it's my duty to put the best
interests of Farmington

Maybe Shane's vice intel gets us
to Antwon Mitchell.

a car parked across the street

from what I hear. Congratulations.

506
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,319
Why do I get the feeling
that's the last compliment

507
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,999
I'll get in this conversation?

508
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,713
I just came from the crime scene.

509
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,514
You've got a lot of unhappy people
out in the street.

510
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,597
HAZMAT's finishing up
a threat assessment.

511
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,155
Why weren't arrangements
made for emergency shelter?

512
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,078
We weren't anticipating
having to evacuate the area.

513
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,392
Next time you have an operation
this size, you should let me know.

514
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,160
I can put the resources of my office
at your disposal.

515
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,078
Head off little snafus like these.

516
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,953
You say snafu, I say the biggest
drug bust in Farmington

517
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,832
in the last 10 years.

518
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,316
Dutch, we're sure
the murder weapon was a.38?

519
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,158
Pending confirmation
from Ballistics.

520
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,715
They found a box of.38 ammo
in the husband's closet.

521
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,797
Find a gun?
Turned the place upside down.

522
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,877
Neighbours said gangs
have been a problem,

523
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,036
but no one saw this car
full of Mexicans.

524
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,593
Take a gun and not the ammo.

525
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,472
Swipe the cheap jewellery,
leave the good stuff.

526
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,274
How much convincing would it take
to move you off this home invasion?

527
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,040
I'm not loving it. Which leaves
the husband and daughter.

528
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,753
Doesn't strike me
he wanted out of the marriage.

529
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,837
So, what was in it
for daddy's little girl?

530
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,196
I think you just answered
your own question.

531
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,153
Do you own a handgun, Warren?

532
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,998
.38 Smith and Wesson.
Why?

533
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,391
DUTCH:
We're looking into the possibility
it could've been the murder weapon.

534
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,353
Where do you keep it?
On a shelf in the bedroom closet.

535
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,828
But it... It's not loaded.

536
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,508
I make it a point to keep
the bullets in the drawer.

537
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,631
So it should be
in the closet there now?

538
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,795
Sure.

539
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,072
Because we've had our people go
all through the place, we can't find it.

540
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,748
DUTCH:
Margo and Donna get along?

541
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,633
They ever argue?

542
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,068
They had opinions.

543
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,794
You tell me, all the time
Donna's spent taking care of you,

544
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,673
she wasn't upset,
Margo wanting you to pull up stakes,

545
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,995
move you to another state?

546
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,999
Uh...

547
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,998
Excuse me,
I'm having a senior moment. Um...

548
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:30,639
We had another break-in
a little while back.

549
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,958
I didn't wanna tell Donna about it
because I knew she'd worry.

550
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,151
It's what she does best.

551
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,556
My gun was stolen.

552
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,959
You report the burglary
to the police?

553
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:47,278
No. Uh, that was probably
a mistake, wasn't it?

554
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:53,193
Captain, I need your officer
to testify in this assault case,

555
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,073
and I am having trouble
serving the subpoena.

556
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,555
He's on vacation.
He gets back on duty tomorrow.

557
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,830
I'll make sure he gets it.
I appreciate it.

558
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,871
Question for you.

559
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,079
How did your office decide to file
in the Webster case?

560
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,635
Oh, it's still in play.
Trying to make a plea bargain?

561
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,156
Oh, I don't know where it is exactly.
I don't have the file in front of me.

562
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:16,399
Is there someone in your office
I can call? To check on it.

563
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,478
The case is in the system.
What's the urgency?

564
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,238
We're moving
to seize the property.

565
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,790
And this won't fly if it gets kicked
down to a misdemeanour.

566
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,279
Look...

567
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,994
I'm not at liberty
to discuss specifics right now.

568
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,555
As soon as I know something,
I will get back to you.

569
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,398
Thanks again.

570
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,638
You're welcome.

571
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,872
You got some explaining to do.

572
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,593
SHANE:
Hey, I was double-blind.

573
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,512
You didn't tell me
what you had going.

574
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,358
Mackey threw this
into high gear behind my back.

575
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,437
I didn't know it was going down
till it was too late.

576
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,599
Hey, two rules:
don't complain and don't explain.

577
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,274
The only rule
is that you don't set the rules.

578
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,670
And you need to explain to your people
that it's bad business

579
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,552
to whack a citizen
in front of a witness.

580
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,113
Now, there's a manhunt
for your boy Freebo.

581
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,151
You had better hope
I'm the one who brings him in.

582
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,508
I got four layers of nigs

583
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,757
don't know who they work for
insulating me from that cul-de-sac.

584
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,359
Yeah, as long as your crew
hangs tight.

585
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,711
One of your boys decides to roll on
one of your other boys to get out
from underneath a murder,

586
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,036
you got a big hole in that insulation.

587
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,515
I'm still the best friend you got.

588
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,108
I appreciate the help.

589
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,719
It's what I'm here for.

590
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,319
And if you'd start listening,

591
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,795
this whole thing would go
a lot easier on the both of us.

592
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,955
You know what?

593
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,391
I think the two of us should
work on our communication skills.

594
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,871
That way shit lik e this
doesn't happen again.

595
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,911
I'll let you know when.

596
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,112
VIC:
Where the hell is Shane?

597
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,671
LEM:
Which one's Weebo
and which one's Freebo? They're twins.

598
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,075
VIC:
Shit, they're running.
Somebody tipped them off.

599
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,713
What if they take off
in different directions?

600
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:48,469
We only got one car.
Where the hell is he?

601
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,079
We gotta go.
Yeah, they're splitting up.

602
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,589
We gotta go.
Damn it.

603
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,589
RONNIE:
Police. Move away
from the bikes, now!

604
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,028
VIC: Hands on your head!
LEM: Gun.

605
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,794
VIC:
Get down on the ground now!
Put your hands on your head!

606
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,797
Get down. Get down.
Get down.

607
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,917
You all right?
Yeah.

608
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,348
WOMAN:
This is 911 emergency.

609
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:08,518
This is Detective Lemansky,
badge number 27228.

610
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,109
I've been involved in
a shooting at 7661 Anholt.

611
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,351
Notify paramedics
and a supervisor.

612
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,192
Where have you been?
What happened?

613
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,789
Goddamn it, we needed you.
You, call for backup.

614
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,718
LEM: Look, I got this.
VIC: Your hands behind your back.

615
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,319
FREEBO:
Look what you did to my brother, pigs!

616
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,475
VIC:
Shut up.

617
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,676
Look, man, we got here as quick
as we could.

618
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,071
Nice try, Freebo.

619
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,229
Dutch says it's breaking different
than home invasion.

620
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,352
Yeah, looks like the daughter.
We just have to trap her.

621
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,592
I've stopped the forfeiture proceedings
in the Webster case.

622
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:44,271
I did some digging.
Webster was on the witness list for
the defence in a separate murder trial.

623
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:48,479
The DA had other interests in that
pot bust beyond enforcing the statute.

624
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,316
Like ruining his credibility
on the stand.

625
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,715
Well, it worked. He was
dropped from the witness list.

626
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,719
The defendant pled.

627
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,512
You just find this out?

628
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,678
You smelled horseshit, turned out
there was a pony in the Barn.

629
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,752
Well, I appreciate your digging.

630
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,118
You know, what I don't get...

631
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,835
is why did the DA choose
the two of you in the first place.

632
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,598
I mean, shady tactics like this,

633
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,598
I think you'd be the last ones
they'd trust to make it work.

634
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,597
I guess we'll never know.

635
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:27,912
As far as it goes between us,
I expect a sea change in your attitude.

636
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,159
Can you hook Freebo into Antwon?

637
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,954
He's a little tweaked about losing
his brother. It's twin shit.

638
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,388
Can I pull a favour?

639
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,751
Have you talk to IAD about
this officer-involved shooting thing.

640
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,718
Well, Lemansky's not under
my command.

641
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,713
You know his CI broke this case for us.
The whole cul-de-sac.

642
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,150
He had permission
from his supervisor to roll with me.

643
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,793
Their first question's gonna be
the same as mine.

644
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,639
Murder suspect,
armed and dangerous.

645
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,955
Where was your backup?

646
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,513
Shane got stuck in traffic.

647
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,478
The brothers were taking flight.

648
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:01,156
We had no way of knowing
which one was Freebo. We had to roll.

649
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,598
Write up a report.
I'll take a look at it.

650
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,150
I got you for killing Romeo Barnes.

651
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,918
We go for special circumstances,

652
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,076
you'll be
seeing your brother again.

653
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:21,192
Don't talk like that, man,
that boy was my heart.

654
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,630
You give up Antwon Mitchell.

655
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,795
That'll buy you a day pass

656
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,673
to ID your brother's body.

657
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,915
Jesus, man,
I don't even know the cat.

658
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,917
I'm trying to k eep your ass
off death row.

659
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,475
If I had something,
I'd give it up.

660
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,629
DUTCH:
We may have caught a break.

661
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,432
CLAUDETTE:
We've got a suspect in custody

662
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,949
apprehended for ripping off
a house down the block.

663
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,158
Multiple convictions for grand theft,
history of violence.

664
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,396
You think he's involved?
You tell us.

665
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,434
Is this one of the men you saw
in the car outside your house?

666
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,112
Yeah, that's him. He was the driver.

667
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,912
Take your time.
We need to be sure.

668
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,838
It was definitely him.
You're positive?

669
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:13,715
A hundred percent. I remember
he was wearing that shirt.

670
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,038
This man's a police officer.

671
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,958
He was patrolling with his partner
when you shot your stepmother.

672
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,629
You... think that I killed Margo?

673
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,798
You dropped your dad off at the library,
went back and shot her.

674
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,832
No!
Then you picked up your dad,

675
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,398
brought him home,
two of you discovered her body.

676
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,631
Same choreography as when
you found your mother.

677
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:41,316
See, that was the last time
you had him all to yourself.

678
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,671
You tried to recapture that moment
in time when he needed you,

679
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,950
when it was just the two of you
against the world.

680
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:50,630
You wanna trick me into admitting
something that I did not do!

681
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:54,389
We've already got your father lying
about what you did.

682
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,910
Any more, he's gonna be
an accessory to murder after the fact.

683
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:04,118
If you confess now, we won't give him
the chance to lie himself into a jail cell.

[GROANS]

686
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,034
If he moved to Arizona,
he'd be dead in six months.

687
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,589
I cook his food.
l... I drive him to the doctor.

688
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:25,191
I make sure he has all 17 of his pills
at the right time each day.

689
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,189
She didn't care about him.

690

[SOBBING]
Not like...

691
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,151
Not like my mother.

692
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,873
Not like me.

693
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,399
She said
that they were going

694
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,591
to Arizona alone.

695
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,028
After all I've done.

696
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,437
She just turned her back on me,
and so I...

697
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,312
Shot her in hers.

698
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,795
What'd you do with the gun
and the jewellery?

699
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,553
I just threw it away.

700
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,239
DUTCH:
Where?

701
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,432
If I tell you...

702
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,995
will you let me say goodbye to him?

703
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:12,754
So I'm in the can, and I look over
and I see two dreadlocks
hanging out of the cabinet of the sink.

This bad boy had to be 6'3".

705

How he folded his ass
into a space like yay:

00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,710
Living in a 6-by-9
with three soul brothers

707
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,552
for a few years
ought to be a cake walk.

708
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,035
Everyone, you have
reason to be proud.

709
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,037
Today's raid netted
the largest cache

710
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,800
of black tar heroin
in Farmington history.

The chief asked me
to convey his thanks.

Each of you will receive
a letter of commendation
from him personally.

714

716
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,520
This citizen that we took
to the hospital, what did you see?

717
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,188
The individual was informed
of the evacuation order.

718
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,035
He responded in a belligerent manner,
was restrained by the other officers.

719
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,430
RAWLING:
Anything to add?

720
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,278
That's pretty much
how it went down.

721
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,438
He isn't even out of the ER,
he's already threatening a law suit.

722
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,518
I'll make it clear to the city attorney
that his case has no merit.

723
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,830
Good work.
Thanks a lot.

724
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,039
Next time those guys
get to party,

725
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,993
over busting some soul brother,
better be out of my earshot.

726
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,428
They're just blowing off steam.

727
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,517
Everybody's just happy
to be in one piece.

728
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,075
Why is everybody treating this
like we just won the big game?

729
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,639
Because that raid
was a home run.

730
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,832
Yeah, well, I'm having a hard time
mustering team spirit
over a beat down.

731
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,315
Get real, Julien, you were there.
You saw what happened.

732
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,875
He was minding his own business
until we showed up

733
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,798
and started dragging him
and everybody else out of their homes.

734
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,389
Well, if those folks were interested
in getting the thugs off the streets,

735
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,511
instead of turning us
into the enemy.

736
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,790
Yeah, well, why are we
only doing this in Farmington?

737
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,673
What about Brentwood,
where the crooked drug lawyers live?

738
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,836
And the bankers who wash
the dirty money?

739
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,712
Why aren't we taking their houses?

740
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,952
If you think it's such a rotten idea,
why'd you help the captain
sell it on that panel?

741
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,957
DUTCH:
Got the gun, missing jewellery.

742
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,311
Three homicides we've caught the past
two weeks. Three for three.

743
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,556
You must be thrilled
to be back in the saddle.

744
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,796
Aren't you?
Wonder what changed?

745
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,395
What do you mean?
I've been the DA's leper for months.

746
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,431
All of a sudden,
I'm back in his good books.

747
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,108
You certainly did your time.

748
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:20,393
These are not the type of people
to let go of a grudge.

749
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,397
And I know I never apologized.

750
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,636
Well, maybe they finally realized
there was no upside

751
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,637
in benching
their two best detectives.

752
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:30,469
The buzz is that taking down
Maurice Webster
gave the prosecution

753
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,557
a win in some murder trial.

754
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,749
Where'd you hear that?

755
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,589
Ooh, that would explain
the sudden change in attitude.

756
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:41,150
That would also suggests
a quid pro quo.

757
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,636
I gotta get with Ballistics.
Confirm this is our murder weapon.

758
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,358
CLAUDETTE: Ballistics can wait.
DUTCH: I'm busy.

759
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,558
And stop treating me like a suspect.
Did you have a chat with Beth Insardi?

760
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:56,036
If we carried the Webster case, maybe
they'd let us out of the doghouse.

761
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,071
Something along those lines?

762
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:01,158
Fine. I confess.

763
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,550
At least now we're getting
confessions from other people too.

764
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,079
Real criminals. Killers.

765
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,238
What other errands do you have us
running for the DA?!

766
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,395
Nothing.

767
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,716
DUTCH:
One of us needed
to mend fences.

768
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,279
You went behind my back.

769
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,869
After being ignored head-on
for six months, you bet I did.

770
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,718
That wasn't your deal to make.

771
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,478
You're the best partner I ever had.

772
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,194
I hung in with you,
waiting for you to see this through.

773
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,118
Instead, you just dug
yourself in further.

774
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,915
I wasn't gonna sit on my hands
and watch you wreck
your career and mine along with it.

775
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,473
I got dinged pretty good in this too.

776
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,399
This was my fight.
And you lost.

777
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,515
So I threw in the towel with the DA.
And I'd do it again.

778
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,349
And if you wanna be pissed at me,
fine, go ahead.

779
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,479
RAWLING:
You put one of my guys on ice

780
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,240
then used that leverage
to turn him into your lapdog.

781
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,438
You do not wanna mess
with my people again.

782
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,070
A new captain is in
no position to make threats.

783
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,840
Assistant DA's are judged
by their conviction rate.

784
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:05,191
How's yours gonna look
when my people show up
an hour late in court,

785
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,436
give witnesses wiggle room
on their statements,

786
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,557
misplace evidence
only on your cases?

787
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,355
Either our offices are working
against each other or working together.

788
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,357
Which is it gonna be?

789
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,879
Together.

790
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,155
Good.

791
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,069
I keep hearing how good
these seizures are
for the neighbourhood.

792
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,475
Can't help wondering
if they're making things worse.

793
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,159
Okay.
This is where people live.

794
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,874
They're raising their kids.
We're treating it's some battleground.

795
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,640
How far is too far?

796
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,393
Okay.

797
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,116
So why are you
coming to me?

798
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,993
To get you to weigh in.
With your seniority.

799

You have got a very popular new
captain who's got the chief's support,

coming off a big success today.

801
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,271
Besides... my opinion doesn't seem
to mean jackshit around here.

802
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,670
If people thought like you
back in the day...

803
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,792
Don't lecture me
about the struggle, son.

804
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,116
I am the struggle.

805
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,072
Breaking down black folks' doors

806
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,874
to make the world safer
is not a new concept.

807
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:12,556
The difference is now you're
the one with the boot on your foot.

808
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:16,548
You got an opinion.
You got a voice.

Use it or lose it.

Hey, I'm getting my nuts twisted
by IAD on account of you.

Oh, easy, Quick Draw.

812
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,955
You stay out of this.

813

about on any subject.

00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,833
Angie's given Social Services the slip.

00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,031
She's probably out there
looking for her mom.

819
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,195
I gotta go find her.

but the investigation is sealed off.

Just say thank you, Antwon.

Do you know how much
you cost me today, huh?

824
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,552
In product and in manpower?
Do you?

825
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,637
Well, if you'd kept me
in the loop on your tar castle,

826
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,990
then maybe I could have
kept an eye out for you, homey.

My niggas saw you faggots
on the goddamn raid.

837
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:45,036
So how you trying to tell me now
there was nothing that you could do?

that kind of heat down on your ass.

842
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,992
Had a talk with her moms.

843
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,595
Amazing what a bitch
will give up for a little rush.

844
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,190
Or in this case, a big rush.

You found her on the street.

Tried to bring her in for foster care.

But she didn't wanna go.

855
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,637
So she offered you a mouth bribe.

856
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,831
One thing led to another.

857
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,992
And then when she threatened
to tell your boss.
