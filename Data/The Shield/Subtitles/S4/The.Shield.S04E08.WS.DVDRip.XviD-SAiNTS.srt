of both killings.

170
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,875
And off of Antwon's plate.

171
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,718
Not necessarily.

172
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,911
Pull in all the unis assigned
to Spookstreet.

173
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,033
I'll do you one better. Danny's
baby mama C.I. is a Spookstreet ho.

174
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,674
She's watching cable
in a safe house on our dime.

175
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,108
What, the one with the 2-year-old?

176
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,834
All her tips have been on One-Niners.
She'd never give up her own.

177
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,315
Danny knows her pretty well,
she thinks she might have a soft spot.

178
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,952
It's worth a shot. Bring her in here.

179
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,151
I have a theory.

180
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,956
About the leaks.

181
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:38,115
Isn't Aceveda's office reviewing
every one of the seizures?

182
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,994
I thought of that.

183
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,994
I see him pulling political moves, not
moves that get people's throats cut.

184
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,795
I'm not pointing any fingers.
Just a notion.

185
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,954
You've given us some great intel
on the One-Niners.

186
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,435
And you pay good money
for the things I hear.

187
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,995
VIC:
Anyone in Spookstreet taking it
upon themselves

188
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,310
to pay back people
they think might be rats?

189
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,118
Everyone wants to know
who's been talking.

190
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,072
Getting the cops
to take their houses and shit.

191
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,720
It's a good thing
I keep my mouth shut.

192
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,434
But Spookstreet is in the middle
of both killings.

193
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,874
You must've heard something?

194
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,035
I can't help you.

195
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,993
Sure you can.
How much is it gonna cost us?

196
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,432
Money's for One-Niner shit only.
Spookstreet's my blood.

197
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,358
I ain't spilling.

198
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,676

Let me talk to her?

CLAUDETTE:
What did he look like?

200
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,591
He already said
he doesn't remember.

201
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,028
He was black.

202
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,674
I got that.
Any identifying features?

203
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,633
Guy beat my head with a bottle.
I was unconscious.

204
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,876
I'm lucky I remember my own name.

205
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,229
CLAUDETTE:
How much he get away with?

206
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,635
At this hour, maybe 300.

207
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,196
DUTCH:
We need you to check
the receipts, tally a total.

208
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,039
So black guy comes in,
attacks you,

209
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,994
and next thing you remember
is a different guy dialling 911 for help?

210
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,878
You ever try writing this shit down?

211
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,116
Come on, we got his statement.

212
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,436
I was by my car pumping gas. I look
up, I see somebody hitting the clerk.

213
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,915
You got a good look inside the station?
Not really.

214
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,469
It wasn't until he came outside
that I got a look at him.

215
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,749
Hot off the press.

216
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,518
DUTCH:
You should work that
up into a flyer.

217
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,676
I thought he'd get
another look at it again first.

218
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,279
Looks great to me.
Right?

219
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,238
How do you know?
You never saw the guy.

220
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,237
That's him.
I've a good eye for detail.

221
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,271
DUTCH:
We appreciate it. We need
anything else, we'll call you.

222
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,232
Okay.

223
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,476
Hey, Julien.
Captain got you riding a desk?

224
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,193
Yeah. Until my complaint's addressed.

225
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,834
The stand you're taking
sets a great example.

226
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,559
Let me know if you need anything.

227
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,152
Hey, listen, since I've got you.

228
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,078
A Jag dinged Aurora's car

229
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,874
in the Gelson's parking lot
and took off without stopping.

230

Do me a favour, run the plates.

We're afraid our seizure C.I. list
has been compromised.

236
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,955
Is there any chance
there's a leak on your end?

237
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,230
My end? That's ridiculous.

238
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,877
You just took office.
You sure you vetted everyone
on staff properly?

239
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,634
They've got confidential police
documents running across their desks.

240
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,673
I'll call IAD myself.
We've got nothing to hide.

241
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,638
What'd they say
about this place?

242
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,432
I'm still investigating.

243
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,393
Oh, so you haven't had IAD in here?
You haven't run Mackey?

244
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,437
Vic may have a hard-on
for authority,

245
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,596
but he would never
put innocents at risk.

246
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,199
He's not the leak.

247
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,594

in the morning.

00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,430

them, as soon as they finish with Vic.

you do, one foot in with the bangers,

it's never gonna work.

get you killed. Or Malcolm.

Maybe not now, maybe not next year,
but somewhere down the line.

257
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,352
I'm safe with Spookstreet.
If I go off on my own,
who am I gonna count on?

00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,232
You think you can count
on those assholes?

259
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,198

will slash your neck

on the One-Niners.

the Spookstreeter did the slashings,

It's in your best interests.

You're pretty quiet tonight.

Anything you wanna talk about?

671
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,315
Think the captain is dumb
or brave for doing this?

672
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,517
Gang Task Force
is a pretty good idea.

Sure as hell keeps me from spinning
my wheels out there, you know.

00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,869
Thanks for putting me
up for that.

675
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,115

No.

We just, uh, need a few more details
for your statement.

682
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:09,518
After the suspect ran out, how long
did it take you to get to the victim?

683
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,119
A few seconds.

684
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:16,952
Once the thief drove off, I ran in,
found him unconscious, called 911.

685

Uh, anybody else there?

686
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,873
I don't think so. Place was empty.

687
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,229
Probably why he robbed it then.

688
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,749
Or why you robbed it then.

I called this in, remember, guys?

You might be smart,
but you're not criminal smart.

691
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,514
And you're a terrible liar.

Part of me wants it to go down
tonight, get this all over with.
