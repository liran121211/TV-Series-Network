00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,795
Carl and Scooby were murdered.
Stabbed to death in a sewer.

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,349
LUCAS: Now Antwon cuts a deal
with DEA and just walks?

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,079
RAWLING:
The deal was made behind my back.

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,191
ASHER: That shithead killed two of us.
RAWLING: I know.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,631
I am assured that
Antwon's cooperation will
lead to numerous arrests.

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,389
LUCAS: Except the prick who
organized it. We should've put a bullet
in him when we had the chance.

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,993
RAWLING:
The feeling is understandable,

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,192
but I need everyone
to be professional in the street.

9
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,798
This is as painful to me
as it is to you.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,436
Hood's happy. Kill a cop,
cut a deal with DEA and skate.

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,990
RAWLING: The department's
looking into that arrangement.

12
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,959
We're gonna do everything
we can to make sure this
doesn't happen again.

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,355
PAULA: So the ship's sailed?
Antwon's free?

14
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,909
And there's nothing
we can do about it.

15
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,358
Is it true that they're pulling
the plug on the seizure policy?

16
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,795
The policy's being discussed
by Pol Com tomorrow.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,353
No decision's been made yet.

18
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,194
We're dropping like damn flies
and nobody's paying for it.

19
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,233
We are really hurting
and angry right now.

20
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,436
But we've got
a job to do.

21
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,990
So let's do it.

22
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,993
We have got to undermine
Antwon's deal with DEA.

23
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,270
The same thought's been
ringing in our ear too.

24
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,950
What about Aceveda
and Phillips? You're hanging
from a pretty thin rope.

25
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,230
Yeah, well, they disagree with me
about a couple of things.

26
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,273
But there's one thing
we don't disagree on,

27
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,597
and that's wanting to see Antwon
in a short stay on death row.

28
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,519
Even so, brass will never
sign off

29
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,075
on us undercutting
a DEA investigation.

30
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,319
That's why they can't find out
about it until after we pull it off.

31
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,955
JULIEN:
Help Danny through this trial.

32
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,630
Guide her, Lord.
Give her strength in adversity.

33
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,353
Oh, Jesus, Julien.

34
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,512
Amen.

35
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,873
How you doing?
I'm okay.

36
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,872
I just can't handle all the
"save her, Lord" stuff
right now. You know, it's...

37
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,070
Anyway, he already did, right?

38
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,276
Look, I was just waiting
for you to wake up.

39
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,675
I thought I'd say a prayer.

40
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,593
As long as you're talking to the man
upstairs, just ask him for a Vicodin.

41
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,711
Thanks for your prayers.

42
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,033
I'll come back later.
I'll help you home.

43
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,595
That'd be great.
Thanks.

44
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,313
Anything?
Checked into Aceveda and Antwon.

45
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,512
Aceveda only visited Antwon
one time. No phone calls, no letters.

46
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,518
Aceveda visited another inmate
before that, though.

47
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,233
Who?
RONNIE: Juan Lozano.

48
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,192
VIC: Who's that?
You mean who was that.

49
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,631
Byz Lat who grabbed
Aceveda's gun, then got busted
by him for armed robbery.

50
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,108
What happened to him?

51
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,595
Took a 40-pound dumbbell
to the back of the head in county.

52
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,717
Bled out in his cell.

53
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,869
So Aceveda meets with Juan,
then with Antwon.

54
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:49,073
Antwon gets a deal, Juan gets killed.
What the hell is up with that?

55
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,988
What?

56
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,795
I heard you visited Juan Lozano
in county the other day.

57
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,430
Here's your doll, okay?
Go play, I'll be right there.

58
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,156
Yeah, he's filed an appeal.

59
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,992
Claims that I forced
his confession.

60
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,156
Lucky for you
he had a little sports injury.

61
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,511
Somebody in county went
Mr. Universe on his skull.

62
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,358
Guy's dead.

63
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,198
Can't say the world
will miss him.

64
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,078
He seems to have
a lot of enemies.

65
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,633
Especially you.

66
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,117
Been going over the paperwork
for his arrest last year.

67
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,437
First he assaults you,
takes your gun,

68
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,790
then you make the collar,
put him away,

69
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,237
go visit him at county,
next thing you know, he's dead.

70
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,031
Well, he's not the first person
to piss off the wrong inmate in jail.

71
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,314
Instead of rehashing the past,
I was hoping

72
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,437
that you could help us
with the future.

73
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,153
In what way?

74
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,748
Your boy Juan,

75
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,116
he have a relationship
with Antwon Mitchell?

76
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,396
Maybe Antwon was
the inmate he pissed off.

77
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,797
Well, Juan seemed pretty desperate.
He lost his juice up in Terminal Island.

78
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,717
Maybe he thought going
after Antwon would get
him back his street cred.

79
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,990
Antwon found out,
struck first?

80
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,677
If Juan was bludgeoned
after Antwon made his deal
with the DEA,

81
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,359
it could kill his immunity.

82
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,916
That's where you come in.

83
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,395
I'm sorry I ever gave
those guys a hand.

84
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,473
Then for Antwon to be responsible
for our cops' deaths,

85
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,711
now maybe this Juan too.

86
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,914
Now, give me some time.
I'll look into it.

ANTWON:
Bonilla?

He's the solo gatekeeper between
U.S. dirt and El Salvador, man.

90
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,118
And old-school crazy.

91

You know, a technophobe.
No cell phone, no e-mail.

92
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,312
Everything gets
hand-delivered to him.

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,511
Now, I say everything,
I mean everything.

94
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,275
Shipments, distribution,
slaughter crews.

95
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,708

LAMBERTl: We could've sent an
agent over to pick these up.

102
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,153
I wanted to see him for one last time
before you sent him off to Shangri-la.

You know his full name?

104
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,236
I only know him as Bonilla.

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,479
You know, cat's got to be
about 50, 60 years old.

106
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,792
He's given us more in a day
than we got in a year.

107
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,311
But the deal's only good

108
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,794
if his testimony leads to arrests
and convictions.

109
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,991

Only reason we'd do it.

Cover things here. I'm leading
a seizure down the road.

506
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,828
What? What seizure?

507
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:03,392
A kid selling scrips from
that abusive foster home
a couple of months back.

508
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,637
Pol Com's meeting tomorrow.
A seizure's the worst thing
you can do.

509
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,752
We just busted Bonilla,
snagged Antwon.

510
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,916
I think I just bought myself
a little cover.

511
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,712
Or we can quit
while we're ahead.

512
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,238
Duly noted.

513
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,751
Again, nice work.

514
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,633
All right, come on.

515
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,070
Why do I have to go?
I didn't do anything.

516
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,713
CLAUDETTE:
You sure about this?

517
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,229
We busted the actual
dealer, 14-year-old.

518
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,152
Assigned to the house
three weeks after Joya's rape.

519
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,516
You still have some doubts?

520
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,997
Glad you could make it.

521
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,959
I'm glad too.
You're out of control.

522
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,752
And now everyone can see that.

523
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,273
I'll take these
children now.

524
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,879
That scares
the shit out of me.

525
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,435
These kids will end up
sleeping in my office tonight.

526
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,518
At least it won't be here.
And now you've shut down this home.

527
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,948
Congratulations.

528
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:00,391
You think it's about
shutting down one home?

529
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,593
This system fails
thousands of kids every year.

530
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:08,635
This is about not putting up
with this shit anymore.

531
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,359

532
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,038

533

Dad had to work late.

534
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,477
And I'm taking you home.

535
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,956

and let's go.

We didn't hear the door.

Evan.

Nice to meet you,

542

I saw something when
I went to get Cassidy
at your apartment.

543
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,075
What?
She was there with a boy.

544
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,396
Evan something.
He lives in your building.

545
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,478

to get to that door.

What were they doing?

547
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,032
She says studying,
but there were no books.

548
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,595
She's been lying to me lately,
and when she's not lying to me,

549
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,119
she's shutting me out.

550
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,237
You know what they say,
11 's the new 13.

551
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,668
No shit.

552
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,676
Mom tells me
you had a friend over.

553
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,239
She makes a big deal
out of everything.

554
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,317
Well, that's her job, right?

555
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,673
Come on, Cass, you know
you're not supposed to have
anyone over there alone

556
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,555
without Carmen or I there,
let alone some cute boy, right?

557
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,478
We weren't doing anything.

00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,598
Okay.

No.

Who is he?

562
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,235
Evan. He lives in 3A.

he's been over there studying?

Yeah.

566

Other kids like him
and he doesn't take
shit from anyone.

00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,118

568
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,990
No. No.

569
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,115

more important things
to being a person, right?

I like him.

Why did Mom have to say anything?

573
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,595
She didn't get you
and now she doesn't get me.

574
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,432

Then why the executioner looks?

581

The Department of Justice
has been on the phone with
the mayor ever since

582
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,955
you twisted DEA's arm
to hand over Mitchell.

They're threatening to pull
federal funds for everything

from law enforcement
to drug treatment.

585
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,270
I gave them Bonilla.
They got what they wanted.

586
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,358
You made them eat shit. And now
they're making the mayor eat it.

yank tens of millions of dollars
from this city...

doesn't want your apology.

00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,674

I tried. I explained the situation
to my colleagues.

598
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:02,035
I got DEA to hand
Antwon over to us.

599
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,831
But that's where
my juice stops.

600
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:09,352
So now you're letting
DEA buy my job?

601
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,469
I'm sorry it ended like this.

The chief too.

604
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:30,432
Because you know that Farmington
is better off now then when I found it.

605

Because the seizures
were working.

606
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:38,516
Because I made sure
that Antwon Mitchell paid

607
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,870
for what he did
to our two cops.

608

from her description,

00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,230
searched his vehicle
while he was sleeping,

623
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,631

with a non-narcotic substance.
