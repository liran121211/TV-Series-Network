we heard a child below.

But the other one,
the black one,

593
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,838
he fought hard.

594
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,395
So I went to help Achebe.

595
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,713
We stabbed him,
we kept stabbing him,
but he wouldn't die.

596
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,713
And then we...

597
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,309
We heard the Asian one.

598
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,750
He was still breathing.

599
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:40,318

657
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:59,953
It is about everyone in here...

658
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,276
and how people think of us
out there.

659
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:06,596
You are screwing
every single cop in this building.

660
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,597
This has nothing to do
with anybody else.

661
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,552
This is about
taking care of me.

662
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,551
Look, the guy's just nervous. I can...
No, it's too late!

663
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,478
Injunctions are keeping the gangs
indoors. I'm surprised to say it, Roy.

664
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,557
But Monica's policies are
really starting to take an effect.

665
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,194
The public sees us
as having our boot on their neck.

666
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,674
When does the press
get good on this?

667
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,995
RAWLING:
We're seeing a difference.

668
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,317
Somebody just has to report it.
Don't shut it down now.

669
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,192
ACEVEDA:
She brought down
Antwon Mitchell for chrissakes.

670
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,755
You've been pissing on her policies.
Why the change?

671
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:47,350
I'm allowed to re-evaluate
my position. As long as
she's willing to also.

672
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:50,358
I really think there's a middle
ground that we can all be happy with.

673
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,790
Like what?
No.

674
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,629
Compromise, retreat
is the worst thing that we can do.

675
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,235
You'd be abandoning the memory
of those two dead cops

676
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,634
and all that they fought for.

677
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,319
PHILLIPS:
Don't play that card with me.

678
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,671
Most people in this town still
think they were killed because
of your seizure policy.

679
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,475
Well, they weren't.
It seems there was a traffic dispute.

680
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,829
ACEVEDA:
Do we know that for sure?

681
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,110
Is there any proof that we
can put in front of the people?

682
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,435
I'll find it.

683
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:18,076
As for the seizures,
they stay or I go.

684
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,949
Then you can tell the brass how you
lost one of L.A.'s two female captains

685
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,072
because she was too tough
on crime.

686
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,839
VIC:
Hey.

687
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,753
l...

688
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,832
I took care of Gusano.

689
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,469
He's not gonna be a threat
to you anymore.

690
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,790
You can stay here
for a few more days

691
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,798
but after that, I can only fudge
the paperwork for so long.

692
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,672
We'll be fine.

693
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,471
How's this little guy?

694
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:05,670
Has he been to a doctor?
Sure.

695
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,512
What did they say?

696
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,870
I gotta make him eat.

697
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,514
Try to get him into a preschool.

698
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:20,274
He used to talk more,
but some of the stuff he's seen...

699
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,436
I'd keep my mouth shut too.

700
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:33,118
I'll go pick up a few things to make
you guys a little more comfortable.

701
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,311
Maybe that'll get
him back to talking.

702
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,912
Thanks.

703
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,878
He confessed.
Kept your name out of it.

704
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,716
Thanks, really.
CLAUDETTE: You're welcome.

No, thanks.

Can't. I gotta be somewhere.

never anything this malicious.

He just said that to hurt us.

So you're not trying
to get close to me just
to get back at him?

00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,759
No. Absolutely not.

So was asking you out a perk?

715
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,389
Sure, but Vic...

716
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,353
Vic's an asshole.
He's the father of my children.

717
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,632
That makes him my
asshole, not yours.

718
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,071
It's not where we started,
it's where we are now.

719
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:01,034
We started with a lie.
I don't even know
where we are now.

I'm sorry.

for me? Dating again?

It was nothing you couldn't
handle. I told you that.

I don't have to handle it.
The PBA guy told me...

732

You trust him before us?
Damn right.

I mean he may not be as
well-versed in these things
as an ex-Army locksmith,

He's gonna keep me out of court.

Well, you toss your
