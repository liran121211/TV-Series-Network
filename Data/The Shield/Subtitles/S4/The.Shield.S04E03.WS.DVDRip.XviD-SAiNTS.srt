00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,113
VIC:
I know you started this war.

501
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,197
RAWLING:
Is that the guy who shot up your car?

502
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,836
Do you even worry about yourself?
About being killed?

503
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,393
When it's time, it's time.

504
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,119
Well, that's a way of looking at it.

505
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,276
I got a witness
saw you tak e the shots.

506
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,748
Help yourself out and cooperate.

507
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,589
You got a witness, huh?
Let me hear what he got to spit.

508
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,518
What other leverage do we have?

509
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,950
VIC:
I had Ronnie look
into Choppa's finances.

510
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,432
He rents an apartment on Baxter.
But he also owns a house.

511
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,715
How'd he pay for it?

512
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,909
Cash down payment.

513
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,832
Makes the mortgages
with money orders.

514
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,996
Drug money. Who lives there?

515
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,156
His mom, her two other kids.

516
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,671
And we don't have anything else.

517
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,552
Mother know
how he paid for the house?

518
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,159
She knows
he's never held down a job.

519
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,593
Can we make a solid connection

520
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,360
between the house payments
and drug money?

521
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,949
You're gonna tell Choppa
we're taking his mom's house?

522
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,718
He's tough,
he could call our bluff.

523
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,558
What if it isn't a bluff?

524
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:10,079
He doesn't ID the shooters,
help us stop this, we take the house.

525
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,915
I love it.

526
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,917
How old are the kids?

527
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,039
Young.

528
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,596
Be a huge PR nightmare.

529
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:26,396
Tossing two kids out onto the street
is not exactly the cleanest example
of how I want this to work.

530
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,636
Taking the house
is the only leverage we have.

531
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:32,230
Yeah, this policy got
a shitload of resistance
when I pitched it to Pol Com.

532
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,153
Chief bit because
nothing else has worked.

533
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,198
The last thing I want
is to give the naysayers any ammo

534
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,796
to shut this down
before it gets a chance to take off.

535
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,398
VIC:
Rise and shine.

536
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,318
Still playing, huh?

537
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,397
Who shot at you?
Last time I'm asking.

538
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,318
Good, because I'm sick
of you barking.

539
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,192
Okay, take the house.

540
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,355
With pleasure.

541
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,788
What house?

542
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,116
The one you bought your mother
by dealing dope.

543
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,231
Yeah, right. You can't take shit.

544
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,510
Come with me. I'll show you.

545
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,469
Do you know what federal
asset-forfeiture laws are, Chopper?

546
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,272
Skipped that course
at Harvard, huh?

547
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,715
It means any property
bought with drug money

548
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,673
or used to facilitate the drug trade
can be seized.

549
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,753
I ain't falling for no bullshit.

550
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,995
No bullshit.

551
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,869
Unless you prove
you bought the house legitamately,
it's ours to put up for auction.

552
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,355
RAWLING:
We're not required to provide
you a defence either.

553
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,074
You wanna fight this?
Then hire a lawyer on your own dime.

554
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,317
Quit clowning. This is America.

555
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,514
Turns out a One-Niner named
Puppethead started this war.

556
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,950
His shortie had a thing
for a Souljah's pogo stick.

557
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,115
That right?

558
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,311
This is all about
a jealous boyfriend.

559
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,080
I see my tax dollars
are being well-spent.

560
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,349
What do you want from me?

561
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,754
I got the guy who started this.

562
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,077
I just need you to keep
these assholes out on the street
from shooting each other

563
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,589
for me to show the neighbourhood
that things are changing.

564
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,756
And we got things under control.

565
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,951
What makes you think
they'll listen to me?

566
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,798
I've seen you work a room.

567
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:17,271
Even convinced a few people
that you're on the straight and narrow.

568
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,119
Feel free to confess
that you're a piece-of-shit gangster.

569
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,632
Thanks for the help.

570
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,838
Detective Wyms.
MAN: Thanks for coming.

571
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,996
DUTCH: What happened?
Guy bought a cup of coffee.

572
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,033
I opened the register, he splashed me.
Grabbed my cash and ran.

573
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,389
I'm lucky, coffee wasn't hot.

574
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,919
CLAUDETTE:
Surveillance camera working?

575
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,917
I got him on my cell phone.

576
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,588
Didn't you talk to that guy today?

577
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,758
Yeah, he had a rock-solid alibi.

578
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:47,078
Aw, man. Aw, man.

579
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,032
This is entrapment.
CLAUDETE: How do you figure?

580
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,630
I'm a thief, he's telling me about asking
for change, then throwing coffee.

581
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,432
It's like giving a junkie a syringe.

582
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,950
I was done robbing
until he put it back in my head.

583
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,871
That's our guy?

584
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:07,474
Uh, actually, we inadvertently
slipped a few details
to one of our other suspects.

585
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,597
Kind of created a copycat.
But we got him.

586
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,995
Still working on the original guy.

587
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,748
Way to go.

588
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,269
Get assigned a simple robbery,
cause a crime wave.

589
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:22,438
Remind me never to put you guys
on a murder case.

590
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,908
Hope you're happy.

591
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,839
Keys. Thanks.

592
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:34,471
Hey, called your dentist.
Paid for your choppers with cash.

593
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,914
Tooth fairy wants them back.

594
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,031
Man, I ain't giving you my fronts.

595
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:42,070
Either you take them out yourself,
or I get a pair of pliers.

596
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,759
Thanks, honey.

597
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,433
LEM:
Vic.

598
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,595
What's up?

599
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,519
One thing we know about Antwon is
he don't like to strap his shit up.

600
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,789
What'd you hear?

601
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,309
Guy's fathered a dozen children
from six different mothers.

602
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,398
Knocked up a couple from behind bars
by sneaking his sperm out.

603
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,919
Holy shit.

604
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,394
You hit up that many women,

605
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,591
you're bound to leave
some serious scorn behind.

606
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,633
All right, let's find out their names.
Anything about Shane?

607
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,110
Nope, not a word.
All right, keep listening.

608
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:16,357
Aloicious? Aloicious,
what have you got us into?

609
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,630
It's okay, Mama.
They just trying to scare me.

610
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,955
It ain't gonna work though.

611
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,912
It's working on me.

612
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,310
It's working on me, Aloicious.
Are you crazy?

613
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,509
Excuse me, can I help you?

614
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,948
Let go of me.
Calm down.

615
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,116
Don't tell me to calm down.
Who's in charge?

616
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,435
Who put my babies on the street?

617
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,755
I'm Captain Rawling.

618
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,599
You did this?
You're taking my house?

619
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,478
I've reserved shelter space
for the three of you.

620
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,035
What the hell am I supposed to do
with shelter space?

621
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,117
The department of Social
and Human Services

622
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,639
can help you find
permanent residence.

623
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,434
You wanna help?
You give me my home back.

624
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,595
I can't do that.

625
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,678
You got no right throwing children
out of their beds.

626
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,553
RAWLING:
All your son has to do
is cooperate with our investigation.

627
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,990
He does that,
he will help us save a lot of lives.

628
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,350
My boy got shot at. He's innocent.

629
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,795
Your boy bought your home
using drug money.

630
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,673
You knew where that money came from,
and you chose to look the other way.

631
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,757
You don't know
what it's like living here.

632
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,511
You think I can just pick
and choose how to go about surviving?

633
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,830
You don't have children,
do you?

634
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:17,030
Do you?! Because if you did,
you couldn't do this.

635
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,518
No mother could do this.

636
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,153
Six children are dead.

637
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,395
How do you think those mothers...?

638
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:26,309
You don't have kids of your own,
so you're throwing mine out.

639
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,759
Just be glad that all you lost today
was your home, and not your son.

640
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,439
Shut up!

641
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,710
You just shut up!

642
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,311
These are recruiters.
Newbies just got their stripes.

643
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,954
They find the next generation
to bring in.

644
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,519
What's up, Lil Bull?

645
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,188
Hey, man, I got some people here
wanna take you guys' pictures.

646
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,351
Gonna make you all famous,
all right?

647
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,391
Go ahead, man, say cheese.

648
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,153
JULIEN:
What's your name, son?

649
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,233
Run, stupid, run!

650
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:08,355
Come here, when a police officer
gives you an instruction, you listen.
You understand?

651
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,039
I don't want
my picture taken.

652
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,470
All right, then why are you
hanging out with gangs? Hey.

653
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,829
What are you,
my mama now?

654
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:14,995
Go.

655
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,069
VIC:
Look, this lawsuit's
gonna bury us financially.

656
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,793
But can you afford not to sue?

657
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:24,555
The money I'm asking you to put up
for medical tests is peanuts

658
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:28,309
compared to what two autistic kids
are gonna need over their lifetimes.

659
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,999
I work at a hospital.

660
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,596
What if I pulled some strings and found
a way to get the tests done there?

661
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,798
The doctors I use are experts.

662
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,434
They're expensive,
but their testimony carries weight.

663
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,108
Her friend Gail
is the head of Paediatrics.

664
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,475
That expert enough for you?

665
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,908
Talk to her.

666
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:47,874
If she's willing to testify and can
provide the credentials I need,

667
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,872
I guess I can live with it.

office shit list for six months.

838
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,948
Oh, I must have missed that memo.

839
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,115
It needs to end.

840
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,634
You need
to divorce your partner.

841
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,558
What's it gonna take
to get the DA off her ass?

842
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,638
Going into his office,
getting on her hands and knees
and begging for his forgiveness.

843
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,671
She's not gonna do that.

844
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,393
Then you're both in
for a long winter.

845
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,555
I got work to do.

846
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,716
Well, what if I, uh?

847
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,032
What if I promise to control her?

848
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,073
Are you sure
you can do that?

849
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,679
I wouldn't be here if I couldn't.

850
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,472
She listens to me.

851
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:23,795
Would that be enough?

852
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,831
This office needs favours
from time to time.

853
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,237
I'd expect you to deliver them
when I ask.

854
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,076
You got a deal.

855
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:40,432
I was told we're moving this stuff out.
All we need's a signature.

856
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,518
Now this guy inside says
we might not?

857
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,633
What's going on, captain?

858
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,559
Give me a minute, okay?

859
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,910
We swept the place.
No drugs, I'm checking the inventory.

860
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,031
Everything's still here.

861
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:09,396
Explain to me why taking this house
was the right thing to do yesterday,

862
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,073
but the wrong thing today.

863
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,919
Yesterday, we had to stop
the shootings.

864
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,429
This house was bought
with drug money.

865
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,073
The mother knew it.

866
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,550
You said
it would be a PR nightmare.

867
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,519
Either it works,
or it doesn't.

868
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:32,196
To make exceptions
to put a prettier face on it...

869
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,034
sounds more like Aceveda
than me.

870
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,708
Take it.

871
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,591
