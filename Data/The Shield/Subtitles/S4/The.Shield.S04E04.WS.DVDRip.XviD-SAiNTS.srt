until we do.

171
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,114
I have been alone.

172
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,758
I went home right after
they delayed that hearing.

173
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,117
He already raped me once.
Why didn't somebody here tell me?

174
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,596
The sheriff's department thought they
had him contained in a downtown area.

175
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,917
Took a couple of hours before they
realised that he had gotten past them.

176
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,989
So he's out there?

177
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,273
Listen, we have a lot of resources
dedicated to this thing.

178
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,675
In the meantime, a couple of officers
could take you home and stand guard.

179
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,835
EMILY:
I...

180
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,515
I'd rather stay here

181
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,915
until you catch him.

182
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,599
VIC:
Yo.

183
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,715
You seen this guy?

184
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,195
You are Blinky, right?

185
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,833
In here, I'm Felix.
What's going on?

186
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,268
Oscar Ruiz, your roommate.

187
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,712
He's in prison.

188
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,110
VIC: He got escaped.
No shit?

189
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,797
So you don't know that he raped
another woman this morning either?

190
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,436
They were about to lay
a life sentence on this prick.

191
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,915
Know what they're gonna do
when they find out you helped him?

192
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,190
Yo, I didn't help him escape.
All right?

193
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,392
I didn't even know he was out
till he showed up this morning.

194
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,355
When did he get here?

195
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,596
He was out back
when I got here to work.

196
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,068
Look, he said
he was innocent.

197
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,272
So I gave him a few dollars to get
to Mexico. I just wanted him gone.

198
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,710
He didn't go to Tijuana.
He went out and raped
another woman.

199
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,115
Used your money to buy the flowers
that got him in the front door.

200
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,154
VIC:
He know how to get
into your apartment?

201
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,237
Hey, he knows
where I keep the spare key.

202
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,038
Hey, man, I'm sorry.
Save it.

203
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,435
Gonna park your ass right here
with an officer

204
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,949
in case Ruiz shows up again.

205
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,514
SHANE:
Antwon Mitchell.

206
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,551

207

SHANE:
Run on inside, kids.

208
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,117
ANTWON:
Man, you've got to be crazy,
showing your face around here.

209
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,999
Especially after that shit
you pulled last night.

210
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,312
I didn't wanna play hard, but your boy
was threatening to own us.

211
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:46,559
Question is, what's next for us?

212
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,910
Halpern was out of line.

213
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,676
That shit won't happen again.

214
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,956
Yeah, well,
that's not good enough, partner.

215
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:59,349
I don't know if
you got a hard-on for jail,
or you just like pissing off cops.

216
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,713
But me and my boy are looking
at the door on this unless
you convince me otherwise.

217
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,869
Come on, shit on them, man.

218
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,591
Hey, don't go sideways on me.

219
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,873
Paid in full.

220
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,478
With a little extra
to make everything all right.

221
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,551
Okay, player?

222
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,719
Good.

223
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,274
But I like making busts too,
so step up the tips.

224
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,277
I'll make sure
you get by same as before.

225
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,754
Things ain't the same
as before, man.

226
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,394
We got these cops coming after us
like storm troopers.

227
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,591
Well, I'm your Luke Skywalker.

228
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,631
The seizures...

229
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,751
I'm close to the cop
who's running it.

230
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,152
How close you to him?

231
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,715
I'm as close as I need to be.

232
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,833
Okay.

233
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,192
Get at me, then.

234
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,039
See, you gotta bring me
some news I can use.

235
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,834
Then the clock starts running
on your protection.

236
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,712
Hey, captain. Back already?

237
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,433
City business.

238
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,116
A multiple rapist walked out
of the courthouse this morning,
attacked another woman.

239
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,157
I need to reschedule.
Anything I can do?

240
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,272
No. Sorry to inconvenience you.

241
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,119
A lot of people have been
talking to me about
these police seizures.

242
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,952
I think we should talk today.
It's important.

243
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,195
Can you wait a few minutes?

244
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,197
Yeah, a few.

245
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,828
Beth Insardi just called.

246
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,792
There's a drug dealer
they wanna make a case against.

247
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,592
She specifically asked
for the two of you.

248
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,279
Really.
CLAUDETTE: You sure she meant us?

249
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,674
Must be the bottom of the barrel.

250
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,916
Doesn't sound it.
His name is Maurice Webster.

251
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,238
He's a big dope fish in our little pond,
so try to wrap a net around him.

252
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,351
Drug sting?
Isn't that more Vic's rhythm?

253
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:52,236
Vic's busy, so I'd take whatever
olive branch the DA's offering.

254
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,715
Beth says there's a time issue,
so don't waste any.

255
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,594
Maybe they're ready
to take the leash off, huh?

256
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,149
RONNIE:
His picture's out there.

257
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,351
Flower shops, supermarkets,
we even covered the on-ramp slingers.

258
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,989
VIC: Anything on the fiancée?
RONNIE: No, nothing.

259
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,428
VIC:
All right, gather around.

260
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:12,155
This is Ruiz's old apartment.
We'll start from here and spread out.

261
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,868
Let's hope he's feeling homesick.
Let's go.

262
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,548
Hey. Any luck on your rapist?

263
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,150
Yeah, all his.
You got something to run by me?

264
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,193
Yeah, I just found a crack
in Antwon Mitchell's family seal.

265
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,674
His oldest son, Donald III,

266
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,997
has been moving fake IDs
out of the back of his van
in the DMV parking lot.

267
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,270
I thought Antwon
kept all of his kids straight.

268
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,040
Well, this one dumped private school
for the family business.

269
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,236
Uh, do me a favour, don't move
on this punk for a day or two.

270
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,591
Why not?
I gotta test a theory.

271
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,792
Someone just spotted Ruiz.
Seventh and Vermont.

272
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,271
So about the seizures.

273
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,233
I understand coming on strong
in the beginning to set a tone.

274
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,556
But maybe you're pushing too hard.

275
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,795
You have a suggestion?
Reach out to the community.

276
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,560
Visit some churches,
community watch programmes.

277
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,309
Put on a friendly face. If these people
don't know you, they won't trust you.

278
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:15,672
When they see us pulling bangers
off their corners, I think
they'll give us a second look.

279
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,190
And what they'll see
is you targeting blacks and Latinos.

280
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,470
That's who's here.
We target the criminals.

281
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,069
Most of their victims
are black and Latino.
They're smart enough...

282
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,636
I'm not trying to kill it.
Maybe with some modifications,

283
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,997
this plan could be
a little more civilian-friendly, that's all.

284
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,480
This coming from a councilman
or a police captain?

285
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,240
Both. And you should know
there's a chance

286
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,671
that I could be overseeing these
seizures on the police committee.

287
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,440
We don't answer
to the police committee on this.

288

every day on her way into work.

00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,152

00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,837
So does this have anything to do
with the territory being disputed?

303
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,191
This is the front line,
which is why Raga
keeps hitting this sign.

304
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,799
Raga just gets the word out.

305
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,468
But if we can get him,
we can find who's giving the orders.

306
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,911
Yeah, look for hoodies or skullies,
and a backpack to carry the paints.

onto taggers for a long time.

of this guy hitting again tonight?

You said he was a late bloomer.

00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,199
Me too.

676
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,831
I need you to proposition me
so I know I'm safe.

677
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,799
I, uh...

678
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,591
wanna be with you.

679
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,872
Sexually.

680
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,557
I'll pay you. Just tell me how much.

681
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,710
You're different, David.

682
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,953
I can tell.

683
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,031
I like you.

684
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,109
Next time, you should bring me a gift
to show me that you like me too.

685
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,154
Anything you want, but nice.

686
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,958
Six hundred dollars' worth.

687
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,437
I can't wait to see
what you pick out.

688
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,795
What are you doing?

689
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,433
I'm undressing you.

690
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,713
Ow.

691
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,717
I'll undress you.

692
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,434
Okay. That hurts.

693
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,751
[SIGHS]

694
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,311
You can slap...

695
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,311
but you can't leave bruises.

696
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,353
Anywhere.

697
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,838
No scratching
and absolutely no blood.

698
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,792
You can pull hair
as long as you don't pull it out.

699
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,639
And you can choke
if it doesn't hurt too much.

700
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:01,518
I'll show you a safe signal
in case I think it's going too far.

701
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,831
Didn't we see her before?

702
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,238
Raga's a girl.

703
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,034
Let me see your hands.

704
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,117
Sorry to ruin your masterpiece.

705
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:43,189
JULIEN:
Not worth it. Just come down
the way you went up.

706
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,828
Come on.

707
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:48,709
You've cost this city tens of
thousands of dollars in cleanup.

708
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,075
Send me the bill.

709
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,235
RAWLING:
We will.

710
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,437
But you tell me who's planning
this war with the Po Boys,

711
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,756
who's giving you these messages,

712
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,076
I can make things better.

713
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,120
Bring her something to eat
while she thinks it over.

714
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,634
Hamburger and fries.

715
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:09,919
Settle a bet first.
What's Raga stand for?

716
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,989
Righteous angel, gorgeous ass.

717
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,915
I don't admire the artwork,

718
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,395
but I got to admire the confidence.

719
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,834
VIC:
How's Pops?

720
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,837
MAN: I don't know.
[VIC CHUCKLES]

721
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,554
If he's king, asshole,
that make you prince?

722
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:30,719
I get some juice on the street.
But I get problems too.

723
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,235
Lot of guys wanna take me down
for being his blood.

724
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,668
Hell, yeah.

725
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,269
You're walking around
with a bull's-eye on your chest.

726
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,708
And where's Antwon?

727
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:42,549
Oh, yeah, that's right,
he's got 10 other kids to look in on.

728
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,432
I hardly know the cat.

729
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,234
Just hear the lectures about
going on the straight and narrow.

730
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,000
He should take his own advice, right?

731
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:56,711
I got an idea how to get him back
for all those sad Christmas mornings.

732
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,797
Back up, man.

733
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,878
I don't like the dude.

734
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:04,356
But I ain't gonna help the white
occupation take him down either.

735
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,798
SHANE:
Look, I heard about the garage,
I passed on the info.

736
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,672
But I'm not gonna guarantee
these things.

737
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,154
I don't give a shit
about that garage.

738
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,396
Then what the hell's
your problem?

739
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,238
They busted my son.

740
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,192
You hear about that?

741
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,549
Huh?

742
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,320
They come around here
looking for help when they want it.

743
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,238
And then they go and bust my son.

744
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,718
They bust my kid, man.
You think that shit is just bad luck?

745
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,515
I'll find out what I can.

746
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,950
They're coming to get me
through my blood, man.

747
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,513
That's what this shit is about.

748
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,914
He said he'll look into it.

749
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,793
Damn it, look in too,
because that's what you're here for.

750
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,036
You're starting to sound
a lot like Halpern.

751
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,834
Maybe you're thinking about
dropping a dime too?

752
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,592
It's cool, brother.

753
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,277
It's cool.

754
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:02,028
I thought you said you were
close to the seizures dude.

755
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,719
I will be.

756
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,919
Right.

757
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:10,116
Then I'm waiting on you,
white shadow.

758
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,073
You been holding my daughter
all night for a little graffiti?

759
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,238
Your daughter tags for one of
the most violent gangs in the city.

760
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,158
Not my daughter.

761
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,158
Hi, Mom.

762
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,316
So where should we send the bill?

763
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:35,792
Still working the garage sting.
Love that.

764
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,634
So I want back in.

765
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,237
Really?
Yeah, you're right.

766
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,000
This new captain,
Farm's where the action is.

767
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,395
But I'll need Army too.
We come as a package.

768
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,751
I can't promise anything,
but I'll grease her wheels.

769
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:52,915
Thanks.

770
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,599
But that being said, things are
gonna be different now, right?

771
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,313
I'll report to you...

772
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,954
but I answer to her,
just like we talked about.

773
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,629
I can probably make that work.

774
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,028
RAWLING:
Beth Insardi just called.

775
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,356
The DA wants the two of you
on a fresh double murder.

776
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,312
Great. Where are the bodies?

777
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,516
Is the DA's office
assigning cases now?

778
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,994
I expected a smile or two.

779
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,997
What did we do
to deserve this promotion?

780
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,919
I don't catch your meaning.

781
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,553
Whose agenda
were we servicing

782
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,877
by targeting and rolling
a three-plant drug kingpin?

783
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,913
I'm not aware of any agenda.

784
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,388
Right.

785
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,670
VIC:
Shane Vendrell.

786
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,075
The guy who rolled those coyotes.
Yeah.

787
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,311
VIC:
I know we're taking on
new personnel.

788
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,317
Truth is, I could really use
someone like him

789
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,511
working the drug angle
with these gangs.

790
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,948
He made a nice bust today.

791
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:00,596
But I don't know him very well
other than what's on paper.

792
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,472
A lot of that's bad.

793
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,830
Aceveda hated Shane
as much as he hates me.

794
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,308
That's what that is.

795
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,476
Didn't you two have some problems
bigger than Aceveda?

796
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:11,717
Well, brothers fight.
Who do you trust more?

797
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,148
So you're vouching for him?

798
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:17,194
Yeah. He's a great cop.

799
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,512
Okay.

800
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,916
