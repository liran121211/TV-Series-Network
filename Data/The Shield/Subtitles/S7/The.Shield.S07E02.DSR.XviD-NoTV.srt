1
00:00:00,991 --> 00:00:03,469
Pervioulsy on the shield

2
00:00:04,317 --> 00:00:06,217
the armenians
know about the money train!

3
00:00:06,252 --> 00:00:07,718
Diro green-lit your family.

4
00:00:07,753 --> 00:00:09,529
If we just work together
on this thing...

5
00:00:09,564 --> 00:00:11,271
We don't work together
on shit anymore.

6
00:00:11,306 --> 00:00:13,777
You had me arrested.
You make the case go away.

7
00:00:13,812 --> 00:00:16,413
As long as I'm locked up
in here, everything's at risk.

8
00:00:16,448 --> 00:00:18,572
Shane is neck-deep
in Armenian shit.

9
00:00:18,607 --> 00:00:19,493
We got to keep him close.

10
00:00:19,528 --> 00:00:21,714
Vic's had this ex-cop
watching us all day long,

11
00:00:21,749 --> 00:00:23,866
and I don't know what's going on
between...

12
00:00:23,901 --> 00:00:26,621
I do. He didn't know about
the bogus Armenian threat.

13
00:00:26,656 --> 00:00:28,517
Shane was acting out
on some bullshit tip

14
00:00:28,552 --> 00:00:29,961
from some banger in county.

15
00:00:29,996 --> 00:00:31,591
I guess one of us
is being lied to.

16
00:00:31,626 --> 00:00:33,451
This is Cruz Pezuela.

17
00:00:33,486 --> 00:00:35,107
This city
needs cops like you.

18
00:00:35,142 --> 00:00:37,766
I have larger interests
I'd like to protect.

19
00:00:37,801 --> 00:00:40,253
Found out the name
of one of your former employees

20
00:00:40,288 --> 00:00:42,867
who was stealing secrets...
Luis aramboles.

21
00:00:42,902 --> 00:00:45,763
Pezuela doesn't know
you lost their blackmail files.

22
00:00:45,798 --> 00:00:46,285
No.

23
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,534
What about the files?

24
00:00:47,569 --> 00:00:48,713
He sold them to rezian.

25
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:52,530
The armenians are making a hard
play for your barrio sandbox.

26
00:00:52,565 --> 00:00:55,729
Looks like I'm gonna need you
to get my family clear of this thing.

27
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:58,893
Make rezian believe the Mexicans
are the armenians' worst problem.

28
00:00:58,928 --> 00:01:00,109
This is L.A., baby.

29
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:01,256
It's latino land,

30
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:03,702
and I know every Mexican gang
from here to sinaloa,

31
00:01:03,737 --> 00:01:06,079
which means that nothing happens
to Vic's family

32
00:01:06,114 --> 00:01:09,064
or you lose the only guy who can
stop your Mexican threat.

33
00:01:09,099 --> 00:01:10,357
I got the Mexicans thinking

34
00:01:10,392 --> 00:01:13,551
that the armenians are making
a power play for the barrio.

35
00:01:13,586 --> 00:01:15,107
So, what now?

36
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:18,432
We can just sit back,
watch the gang war.

37
00:01:18,866 --> 00:01:22,038
www.1000fr.com presents

38
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:26,551
Sync: Vine

39
00:01:41,251 --> 00:01:42,973
bring back memories?

40
00:02:01,517 --> 00:02:04,895
On a clear night, you can
see Guardo's house from here.

41
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,198
Don't worry.
I haven't seen his ghost around.

42
00:02:09,773 --> 00:02:10,805
Come on.

43
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:23,906
Who's the amigo?

44
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,938
Luis aramboles.

45
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:28,555
Intel operative
for the mexis.

46
00:02:28,852 --> 00:02:31,417
He came up here
to start some shit.

47
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,585
I told your boss you sold his
box of sins to the armenians,

48
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,958
which means you're breathing
on borrowed time.

49
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:40,586
He won't believe that.

50
00:02:40,621 --> 00:02:43,258
They're already out
looking for you.

51
00:02:43,293 --> 00:02:45,895
Price on your head...
I could retire.

52
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,003
It's time to disappear...

53
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:51,497
Unless you want me
to just turn you over.

54
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,768
Who's he?

55
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:58,121
Someone who wants to help you
with your travel arrangements.

56
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,900
He would never want to see
an... innocent man get killed.

57
00:03:07,691 --> 00:03:08,710
Hey.

58
00:03:08,886 --> 00:03:10,222
Hey!

59
00:03:10,368 --> 00:03:12,375
You want to give me a clue
what all this is about?

60
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,658
He's the key to defusing
the Armenian time bomb

61
00:03:15,693 --> 00:03:18,569
you laid
at my family's doorstep.

62
00:03:20,045 --> 00:03:22,241
He's the keeper of the intel
the mexis are using

63
00:03:22,276 --> 00:03:24,656
to blackmail
their way to the top.

64
00:03:24,691 --> 00:03:27,036
Or was,
till I helped myself.

65
00:03:27,655 --> 00:03:30,553
And you made it look like this
prick sold out to the armos.

66
00:03:30,588 --> 00:03:33,451
Which lit the fuse for
the blood feud we're stirring up

67
00:03:33,486 --> 00:03:35,455
between rezian
and the Mexicans.

68
00:03:36,386 --> 00:03:37,983
Nicely done.

69
00:03:40,576 --> 00:03:43,971
Aramboles is the only one
who can put my face to the grab.

70
00:03:44,471 --> 00:03:46,319
So he's got to go away.

71
00:03:46,354 --> 00:03:49,025
I need you to hook him up
with the coyotes we were using

72
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,640
to get Lem set up
down in Mexico.

73
00:03:52,027 --> 00:03:52,843
Who's he working for?

74
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:54,259
I want him gone
by tomorrow night.

75
00:03:54,294 --> 00:03:55,990
Getting him out of the country's
not a problem.

76
00:03:56,298 --> 00:03:59,525
Setting him up on a goat farm
with money and contacts,

77
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,752
it would be nice to know who
and what I'm dealing with.

78
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:06,193
Working with you to protect
my family...

79
00:04:06,194 --> 00:04:07,947
I'm down with that.

80
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,569
Trusting you?

81
00:04:10,762 --> 00:04:11,945
Not there yet.

82
00:04:15,816 --> 00:04:21,653
S7E02

83
00:04:27,896 --> 00:04:29,159
that's a mistake.

84
00:04:29,822 --> 00:04:31,472
You should have
come to me first.

85
00:04:31,507 --> 00:04:33,054
This piece of shit
rezian...

86
00:04:33,089 --> 00:04:35,323
He's taken something
that belongs to me.

87
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:39,084
So drop a couple of low-level
Armenian bodies on the street.

88
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:41,731
Scare them into getting
your blackmail box back,

89
00:04:41,766 --> 00:04:44,352
but trying to whack rezian now
goes too far too fast.

90
00:04:44,387 --> 00:04:46,119
It's already in motion.

91
00:04:46,694 --> 00:04:49,381
Be prepared
to help me control the blowback.

92
00:04:50,422 --> 00:04:52,044
When's this going down?

93
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,131
Today.

94
00:04:55,551 --> 00:04:58,081
We have some people
in county jail where he's at.

95
00:05:00,651 --> 00:05:03,895
Look, when all hell breaks loose
out on the street because of this...

96
00:05:05,707 --> 00:05:07,647
It's gonna
hurt your business.

97
00:05:08,453 --> 00:05:11,133
And it's gonna hurt my ability
to protect you.

98
00:05:11,783 --> 00:05:16,800
I'm confident you'll be able
to handle the job adequately.

99
00:05:17,346 --> 00:05:19,138
Any other questions?

100
00:05:20,013 --> 00:05:21,522
Not at the moment.

101
00:05:27,938 --> 00:05:30,147
Hey, Tina,
have you seen shane?

102
00:05:30,182 --> 00:05:32,357
No, haven't had
the pleasure today.

103
00:05:32,991 --> 00:05:33,998
What the hell is this?

104
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:37,469
The mayor just released a list
of the top-10 most wanted gangs

105
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,473
to a press conference
this morning.

106
00:05:39,508 --> 00:05:42,508
Hey, are we making celebrities
of these douche bags now?

107
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:45,290
It's the latest initiative
in the city's war on gangs.

108
00:05:45,325 --> 00:05:48,037
It's just gonna get sets
competing to move up the ladder.

109
00:05:48,072 --> 00:05:50,455
Gang crime's up 14%
citywide this year.

110
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:52,839
While Farmington's numbers
are down.

111
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:54,876
I guess
I can't be everywhere.

112
00:05:54,911 --> 00:05:57,084
I weighed in against this
with Phillips.

113
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,587
I was told that the mayor
wants to be proactive

114
00:05:59,622 --> 00:06:02,775
in identifying gang problems
to reassure the public.

115
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:05,458
Well, it made the front page,
so hang on.

116
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:09,393
Well, fortunately, most of these
bangers can't read.

117
00:06:09,428 --> 00:06:12,794
Still, I got the over/under on one
of these crews doing the first whack

118
00:06:12,829 --> 00:06:15,472
to move up the list
in three hours.

119
00:06:15,507 --> 00:06:16,932
I'll take the under.

120
00:06:17,179 --> 00:06:19,950
Rumor has it that you're
scheduled for a new hearing.

121
00:06:20,323 --> 00:06:21,908
Four weeks from today.

122
00:06:21,943 --> 00:06:24,394
Well, if you would like to spend
that time with your lawyer,

123
00:06:24,429 --> 00:06:27,734
your pba rep organizing
your case...

124
00:06:28,508 --> 00:06:31,575
As long as I got this,
I'm gonna use it.

125
00:06:31,703 --> 00:06:32,998
Nice try, though.

126
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:36,132
Arrangements
have been made.

127
00:06:36,167 --> 00:06:40,597
??? Have aramboles
ready at 10:00.

128
00:06:45,851 --> 00:06:48,805
This war we started is already
spinning out of control.

129
00:06:49,305 --> 00:06:51,405
Mexicans have overreacted.

130
00:06:51,841 --> 00:06:53,311
Rezian's been green-lit.

131
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:55,534
They're gonna make a move
against him tonight.

132
00:06:56,003 --> 00:06:57,375
Protecting rezian
is the only thing

133
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:58,748
that's keeping
your family alive.

134
00:06:58,783 --> 00:06:59,853
I'm not the one behind this.

135
00:06:59,888 --> 00:07:01,594
We need to get rezian
in protective custody.

136
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:02,945
It's too late for that.

137
00:07:03,429 --> 00:07:06,161
He'll be dead
before the request is processed.

138
00:07:07,269 --> 00:07:09,008
Jesus.

139
00:07:10,435 --> 00:07:11,359
Okay.

140
00:07:12,535 --> 00:07:14,301
Okay, maybe...

141
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:17,666
Maybe my Armenian problem
goes away.

142
00:07:17,701 --> 00:07:19,843
With rezian dead,
maybe he's the only armo

143
00:07:19,878 --> 00:07:21,951
who knows enough about me
to hold a grudge.

144
00:07:21,986 --> 00:07:25,049
Or maybe Armenian number 2
knows what rezian knows

145
00:07:25,084 --> 00:07:27,630
and blames us
for getting the boss whacked.

146
00:07:33,347 --> 00:07:35,118
You have to warn him.

147
00:07:35,153 --> 00:07:37,921
Yeah, so he can get himself
in the right frame of mind to take a shiv?

148
00:07:37,956 --> 00:07:39,981
No, I'll figure out
how to head that off.

149
00:07:40,016 --> 00:07:43,017
Meanwhile, you get cred
by giving him a heads-up,

150
00:07:43,052 --> 00:07:44,787
and he'll owe you.

151
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,637
How you holding up?

152
00:07:47,672 --> 00:07:49,323
Oatmeal and bologna.

153
00:07:49,358 --> 00:07:51,481
I haven't had a woman
in weeks.

154
00:07:51,516 --> 00:07:53,605
Well, oatmeal's good
for the colon.

155
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,378
You think this is funny?

156
00:07:55,413 --> 00:07:56,953
The D.A.'s
squeezing the accountant

157
00:07:56,988 --> 00:07:58,505
who did my books at the port.

158
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,987
He agreed to turn evidence.

159
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:02,358
He's being deposed
this afternoon.

160
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,103
I'll see what I can do.

161
00:08:05,515 --> 00:08:08,134
Meantime, you got
a much bigger problem.

162
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:10,944
I got word
that you're hard candy.

163
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:13,268
You've been green-lit
by the Mexicans.

164
00:08:13,303 --> 00:08:14,724
The Mexicans? Why?

165
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:16,051
Look, you just need
to watch yourself

166
00:08:16,086 --> 00:08:19,366
until I can get you
moved into protective custody.

167
00:08:19,722 --> 00:08:21,911
I am going to protect you.

168
00:08:21,946 --> 00:08:23,505
You better.
You know why?

169
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,029
Anything happens to me,

170
00:08:25,064 --> 00:08:28,622
I've already given the order to
go after your friend's family.

171
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,831
And yours, too.

172
00:08:32,526 --> 00:08:36,701
If I wanted you dead,
I wouldn't warn you.

173
00:08:36,736 --> 00:08:39,729
Then let's just call it
incentive.

174
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:47,416
I guess some of these bangers
can read.

175
00:08:48,466 --> 00:08:50,820
This is John layton,
Pasadena address,

176
00:08:50,855 --> 00:08:52,640
no priors, no witnesses,

177
00:08:52,675 --> 00:08:54,871
at least none
of the sharing kind.

178
00:08:54,906 --> 00:08:57,384
What's Mr. Layton from Pasadena
with no priors

179
00:08:57,419 --> 00:08:59,863
doing walking around
this stretch of misery?

180
00:08:59,898 --> 00:09:02,323
Gang turf,
upscale victim... drugs?

181
00:09:02,429 --> 00:09:05,309
This is not
where whitey scores his powder.

182
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:08,346
Century Boulevard caters more
to the pale-face group.

183
00:09:08,905 --> 00:09:10,942
He's got over $100 in cash
in his wallet.

184
00:09:10,977 --> 00:09:12,332
It's no robbery.

185
00:09:12,367 --> 00:09:14,017
Maybe trying to pick up a trick?

186
00:09:14,052 --> 00:09:15,668
The stroll's
six blocks that way.

187
00:09:16,516 --> 00:09:19,423
These tags...
Los mags, one niners...

188
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,099
This is gang central.

189
00:09:21,134 --> 00:09:22,706
We all know what this is.

190
00:09:22,741 --> 00:09:25,248
Only difference is, you're the
one who has to call the mayor

191
00:09:25,283 --> 00:09:27,715
and tell him that his list
got a white guy popped.

192
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,882
We don't know
it's top-10 related.

193
00:09:29,917 --> 00:09:31,134
Drive-by?

194
00:09:31,277 --> 00:09:34,553
Look, this list is like the
standings in the sports section,

195
00:09:34,588 --> 00:09:37,393
and every gang
is making a playoff push.

196
00:09:37,428 --> 00:09:39,032
Find the shooter.

197
00:09:41,786 --> 00:09:43,844
Okay, Vic and I
will take the one niners...

198
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:45,478
No, no, no, no.
Shane comes with me.

199
00:09:45,513 --> 00:09:46,906
L-I'll bring him up to speed.

200
00:09:47,285 --> 00:09:49,724
You and Julien
go press the Los mags.

201
00:09:53,652 --> 00:09:55,575
How'd rezian
take the bad news?

202
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,882
He's a big believer
in life insurance.

203
00:09:57,917 --> 00:10:01,340
He gets whacked, they come after
your family and mine.

204
00:10:04,665 --> 00:10:07,284
We got to figure out how many
rungs on the Armenian ladder

205
00:10:07,319 --> 00:10:09,788
know about
our money-train rip-off.

206
00:10:09,823 --> 00:10:11,746
Jesus Christ!

207
00:10:12,707 --> 00:10:14,658
How'd we lose control
of this?

208
00:10:14,693 --> 00:10:16,936
Rezian's accountant's
about to give him up.

209
00:10:16,971 --> 00:10:19,251
He expects me
to hose him down.

210
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:22,558
If we don't,
that screws us up, too.

211
00:10:23,516 --> 00:10:28,067
The accountant... later.
Keeping rezian alive... now.

212
00:10:29,522 --> 00:10:30,670
Moses.

213
00:10:32,037 --> 00:10:34,660
Just crashing by
to say, "what up?"

214
00:10:34,695 --> 00:10:36,178
Redecorating?

215
00:10:36,213 --> 00:10:37,363
This is all your boys.

216
00:10:37,398 --> 00:10:39,271
Pigs blew through here
like a damn hurricane.

217
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:40,772
Tossed
my breezie's crib, too.

218
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,465
Shut down my weed spot
around the way,

219
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,758
and I ain't done no harm.

220
00:10:43,793 --> 00:10:45,848
You waking up in the morning
does harm.

221
00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:48,808
Dead bodies on your turf...
Not a good look, Moses.

222
00:10:48,843 --> 00:10:51,468
Like I told po-po,
don't know nothing about it.

223
00:10:51,503 --> 00:10:53,425
Didn't stop them
from messing up my place.

224
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:57,731
I guess you don't know nothing
about the top-10 list in the paper, either.

225
00:10:57,766 --> 00:11:00,358
I know we reppin' at number 5.
I'm good with that.

226
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:02,581
Blow a hole in a white man,
you get respect,

227
00:11:02,616 --> 00:11:04,007
shot at number 1.

228
00:11:04,042 --> 00:11:05,363
I'm a businessman.

229
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:07,842
And merking white folk
is a no-go for my commerce.

230
00:11:07,877 --> 00:11:10,649
What about one of your baby
bangers trying to earn cred?

231
00:11:10,684 --> 00:11:13,566
One of my g's wildin' out,
I'd have heard.

232
00:11:13,601 --> 00:11:16,657
There's plenty of nigs out there
perpetrating felonious bullshit.

233
00:11:16,692 --> 00:11:19,038
Why don't you swarm on them?
Stay out of my grill.

234
00:11:19,073 --> 00:11:21,501
Who else would pull a Jack move
like this?

235
00:11:21,536 --> 00:11:25,778
Athens, piru, spook street.

236
00:11:25,813 --> 00:11:27,055
Spook street
didn't even make the list.

237
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,595
What I'm saying.

238
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:31,241
They need to step they game up
or they out.

239
00:11:32,704 --> 00:11:35,011
You got any soldiers
in county, Moses?

240
00:11:35,046 --> 00:11:36,767
Do I got soldiers in county?

241
00:11:36,802 --> 00:11:39,441
We straight claiming county
as one nine turf.

242
00:11:40,565 --> 00:11:42,068
Got a deal for you.

243
00:11:42,381 --> 00:11:44,750
We have an associate
locked up there.

244
00:11:44,785 --> 00:11:46,211
Needs protecting.

245
00:11:46,246 --> 00:11:48,496
I ain't doing Jack for you
till this shooter's gaffled up.

246
00:11:48,531 --> 00:11:50,610
Keep the cops out of my shit.

247
00:11:50,645 --> 00:11:53,770
You do this, I'll make sure
our guys back off.

248
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:57,358
You got till 4:00 to make
the streets smooth

249
00:11:57,369 --> 00:11:59,145
so I can be about my paper.

250
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,508
Then I'll see about your boy
in county.

251
00:12:02,463 --> 00:12:03,525
Deal.

252
00:12:05,921 --> 00:12:08,240
Please get these people
behind the yellow tape.

253
00:12:08,275 --> 00:12:10,686
Victim's lana boyle.

254
00:12:10,721 --> 00:12:13,264
Looks like a cinder block
fell and killed her.

255
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:14,730
Death from above.

256
00:12:14,765 --> 00:12:17,822
This is Doug obermyer.
Victim's his girlfriend.

257
00:12:17,826 --> 00:12:20,379
I'm detective Wagenbach.
This is detective Billings.

258
00:12:20,414 --> 00:12:21,342
I'm really sorry.

259
00:12:21,377 --> 00:12:23,452
Dude, one of those assholes
murdered her!

260
00:12:23,487 --> 00:12:24,692
You think
this wasn't an accident?

261
00:12:24,727 --> 00:12:26,834
Those goddamned beaners
have been hassling us

262
00:12:26,869 --> 00:12:28,616
ever since
we rented this space.

263
00:12:28,651 --> 00:12:30,329
Um, this is a commercial
building?

264
00:12:30,364 --> 00:12:32,979
It's a rehearsal space.
Lana was our lead singer.

265
00:12:33,014 --> 00:12:35,270
Yeah, rent's cheap
in this neighborhood.

266
00:12:35,305 --> 00:12:37,511
The tenants next door
didn't like the music?

267
00:12:37,546 --> 00:12:39,717
It was one of them, man.
They killed her.

268
00:12:39,752 --> 00:12:41,124
You're gonna
arrest somebody, right?

269
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:43,782
We're gonna talk to people,
try and determine what happened.

270
00:12:43,817 --> 00:12:45,648
I was out here
when it happened!

271
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,630
They was yelling out of the
window, bitching at us to move!

272
00:12:48,665 --> 00:12:49,932
And... and you didn't?

273
00:12:49,967 --> 00:12:50,927
If they don't like our smoke,

274
00:12:50,962 --> 00:12:53,947
they can go back to Mexico city
and choke on the smog!

275
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:55,924
Okay, Doug, Doug,
don't go away.

276
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:58,214
I may need
to talk to you again, okay?

277
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:02,125
I wonder if rock-Star bo???

278
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,423
Is more upset about losing
his girl or his lead singer.

279
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:06,697
Somebody did drop
that cinder block intentionally,

280
00:13:06,732 --> 00:13:08,576
probably a resident.

281
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:10,799
Maybe still in the crowd.

282
00:13:12,697 --> 00:13:14,995
Oh, right. I'll, uh, get a read.

283
00:13:15,543 --> 00:13:17,953
Don't want to put you out.

284
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,407
I interviewed
the boys in the band.

285
00:13:20,442 --> 00:13:21,971
They were all out here
when it happened,

286
00:13:22,006 --> 00:13:23,000
but nobody was looking up

287
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:25,131
when the cinder block
came tumbling down.

288
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:27,072
The band was just here
taking a smoke break.

289
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:28,979
I need you to track down
the building manager.

290
00:13:28,991 --> 00:13:30,068
I want every tenant

291
00:13:30,103 --> 00:13:33,655
with a window view of the street
brought down here.

292
00:13:34,426 --> 00:13:35,794
Policia.

293
00:13:35,829 --> 00:13:37,695
We need everyone
outside now.

294
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,151
Policia!

295
00:13:40,752 --> 00:13:42,000
Hey!

296
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:44,672
Come on out!
We can hear you in there!

297
00:13:44,707 --> 00:13:47,475
Great. We respond to a murder.
We get a domestic.

298
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,378
Luna puta!

299
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:51,796
Iabre la puerta ahora!

300
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,124
- What?!
- HEy!

301
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:54,125
A little more respect!

302
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,013
And didn't you
hear us knocking?!

303
00:13:56,048 --> 00:13:57,866
Listen up.
A girl was killed outside.

304
00:13:57,901 --> 00:13:59,297
We need everyone
downstairs now.

305
00:13:59,332 --> 00:14:01,972
Nothing to do with us.
Icierra la pinche puerta!

306
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,797
Step aside.
And you shut up.

307
00:14:03,832 --> 00:14:05,143
Tell your woman
to put some clothes on

308
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:08,269
and get downstairs
for questioning right now.

309
00:14:08,304 --> 00:14:11,361
Hey! Put your hands
where I can see them now!

310
00:14:18,852 --> 00:14:24,027
He was getting a shirt to cover her up
like you asked him to.

311
00:14:26,914 --> 00:14:30,596
Total news blackout on anything
gang-related until further notice.

312
00:14:30,631 --> 00:14:31,356
Wouldn't have anything to do

313
00:14:31,391 --> 00:14:33,175
with the businessman
being shot this morning?

314
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,077
Whatever the reason,

315
00:14:34,112 --> 00:14:36,566
something like this happens,
it's a tragedy.

316
00:14:36,601 --> 00:14:38,627
And the timing
couldn't be worse.

317
00:14:38,662 --> 00:14:41,062
And because the mayor doesn't
want to fuel speculation

318
00:14:41,097 --> 00:14:43,990
that his gangbanger hall of fame
is the cause.

319
00:14:44,025 --> 00:14:46,070
- WHo's working the case?
- STrike team.

320
00:14:46,105 --> 00:14:46,837
Mackey in the mix?

321
00:14:46,872 --> 00:14:48,389
- FRont and center.
- GOod.

322
00:14:48,424 --> 00:14:51,024
Oh, don't tell me you're
drinking his kool-aid now, too.

323
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:52,615
Am I the only one
who will remember

324
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:54,137
the trail
his tornado left behind

325
00:14:54,172 --> 00:14:56,666
if and when he's finally
thrown out of here?

326
00:14:56,701 --> 00:14:59,161
I'm under no illusions,
but a day like this one?

327
00:14:59,896 --> 00:15:01,187
I can live with him.

328
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:06,055
Who's that guy?

329
00:15:06,391 --> 00:15:07,892
Jamal
just replaced trinitron

330
00:15:07,927 --> 00:15:10,218
as the number-one shot-caller
for spook street,

331
00:15:10,253 --> 00:15:14,364
although he claims to be just another
downtrodden black man in the struggle.

332
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,681
Join the club.

333
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,358
You know what the street's
saying about your set?

334
00:15:22,393 --> 00:15:24,490
Calling you the clown posse,

335
00:15:24,525 --> 00:15:26,924
as in laughing at you,
not with you.

336
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,336
Hauling me out of bed without
letting me take my calm pills.

337
00:15:29,371 --> 00:15:30,666
Spook street's a joke.

338
00:15:30,701 --> 00:15:31,927
They in my pocket.

339
00:15:31,962 --> 00:15:33,762
Forget to take them
yesterday, too.

340
00:15:33,797 --> 00:15:35,528
And y'all are making me
on edge.

341
00:15:35,563 --> 00:15:39,494
Hey, my wife... she takes these
when she's on the rag.

342
00:15:39,529 --> 00:15:42,133
Maybe I should
get you a tampon, too.

343
00:15:42,168 --> 00:15:44,175
You gave the order
to merk that white guy,

344
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,342
let people know that
spook street's still around.

345
00:15:46,377 --> 00:15:48,475
Maybe you can get spook street
on that top-10 list.

346
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,683
Hell, they could put together
a top-100 list.

347
00:15:50,718 --> 00:15:52,821
Your piece-of-shit crew
wouldn't be on it.

348
00:15:52,856 --> 00:15:54,906
How am I trying to beef with
some white dude I never seen?

349
00:15:54,941 --> 00:15:57,028
Maybe you were just trying to
lay down the law,

350
00:15:57,063 --> 00:15:59,081
trying to get your soldiers
to come correct,

351
00:15:59,116 --> 00:16:02,638
Pasadena square biz
walks into your line of fire...

352
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:05,239
Look,
if this was accidental,

353
00:16:05,274 --> 00:16:08,129
maybe one of the guys in your
crew has an itchy finger,

354
00:16:08,164 --> 00:16:08,988
we can help.

355
00:16:09,023 --> 00:16:11,315
All you got to do
is tell us the truth.

356
00:16:13,378 --> 00:16:15,469
Man, I got kids to feed...

357
00:16:16,174 --> 00:16:17,910
Another one on the way.

358
00:16:18,282 --> 00:16:20,110
My moms is dying.

359
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,860
I ain't a clown.

360
00:16:22,895 --> 00:16:24,745
I ain't a bitch.

361
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:27,947
Just trying to look out
for my own, make my way.

362
00:16:27,982 --> 00:16:29,418
A man of peace.

363
00:16:29,453 --> 00:16:31,604
With the most high
as my witness,

364
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:33,609
I didn't shoot no man.

365
00:16:33,644 --> 00:16:36,048
Don't know about no shooting.

366
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:40,246
Now, please,
can I have my pills?

367
00:16:45,222 --> 00:16:47,450
Any gang presence
in the building...

368
00:16:47,485 --> 00:16:49,644
Young men, tattoos,
baggy t-shirts?

369
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:51,895
Yeah, I know what gang members
look like.

370
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:54,035
Nah, it's mostly families.

371
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:56,578
They pay their rents on time,
and they keep to themselves.

372
00:16:56,613 --> 00:16:59,086
Complaints about the noise
and the smoking next door...

373
00:16:59,121 --> 00:17:00,700
Anybody
particularly more upset?

374
00:17:00,735 --> 00:17:02,161
Nobody's complained to me,

375
00:17:02,196 --> 00:17:03,571
and I can't think
of anybody here

376
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:04,801
who would do anything
like this.

377
00:17:04,836 --> 00:17:05,996
Where were you
when it happened?

378
00:17:06,031 --> 00:17:07,481
At the hardware store

379
00:17:07,516 --> 00:17:10,280
to get a pipe fixture
for a broken toilet.

380
00:17:11,638 --> 00:17:14,390
Um, thanks.
I'm gonna need that tenant list.

381
00:17:14,425 --> 00:17:15,159
Sure.

382
00:17:16,429 --> 00:17:19,894
Can I, uh...
Steal him for a minute?

383
00:17:20,233 --> 00:17:21,795
I'll be back.

384
00:17:22,644 --> 00:17:24,041
You get
any good information?

385
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:26,938
If you mean her phone number,
no, thanks to you.

386
00:17:28,397 --> 00:17:33,101
If this is the Billings level
of effort I can look forward to,

387
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:34,571
you may as well just go home.

388
00:17:34,606 --> 00:17:38,070
No, me interviewing a witness
is just as good as you doing the same.

389
00:17:38,578 --> 00:17:41,553
I'm the only one working
at maximum capacity.

390
00:17:41,588 --> 00:17:44,528
Really? What did you
come up with so far?

391
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:46,574
Hey, Dutch,
I talked to every tenant

392
00:17:46,609 --> 00:17:48,160
with an apartment
on this side of the street,

393
00:17:48,195 --> 00:17:50,845
and every single one of them
says they didn't see anything.

394
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,386
Same here.

395
00:17:52,421 --> 00:17:54,552
Looks like they'd rather be
watching their novelas

396
00:17:54,587 --> 00:17:55,711
than help I.D. A killer.

397
00:17:55,746 --> 00:17:58,153
Yeah, don't worry.
Dutch is on the case.

398
00:17:58,645 --> 00:18:00,734
Young woman
got her head bashed in.

399
00:18:00,769 --> 00:18:02,824
You're not disturbed
by the apathy?

400
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:05,035
Why don't you
take a look around you?

401
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:07,038
We've been standing
in the hot sun for how long now,

402
00:18:07,073 --> 00:18:08,422
and we are
right where we started.

403
00:18:08,457 --> 00:18:11,634
So if you've got some magic beans
in your detective bag of tricks

404
00:18:11,669 --> 00:18:13,446
that'll make these people
give a shit,

405
00:18:13,481 --> 00:18:15,223
why don't you start
planting them?

406
00:18:15,651 --> 00:18:17,306
You know what, Steve?
You're right.

407
00:18:17,341 --> 00:18:18,216
We have been here a while.

408
00:18:18,251 --> 00:18:20,670
Excuse me!
Could I have your attention?

409
00:18:20,705 --> 00:18:22,354
I'm pleased to announce

410
00:18:22,389 --> 00:18:24,070
that, today, you're all
gonna have the pleasure

411
00:18:24,105 --> 00:18:27,832
of seeing your local tax dollars
at work up close and personal.

412
00:18:27,867 --> 00:18:29,976
Since none of you
want to do the right thing here,

413
00:18:30,011 --> 00:18:32,085
you're all coming down
to the Farmington station

414
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,841
for continued questioning.

415
00:18:33,876 --> 00:18:37,085
And until someone comes forward
who saw what happened,

416
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,920
I'm gonna make all of your lives

417
00:18:38,955 --> 00:18:42,575
as inconvenient
and unpleasant as possible.

418
00:18:43,167 --> 00:18:44,531
Have a nice day.

419
00:18:44,781 --> 00:18:46,692
Better get a bus down here.

420
00:18:50,327 --> 00:18:51,272
What's up?

421
00:18:51,748 --> 00:18:52,668
Colorado plates.

422
00:18:52,703 --> 00:18:55,120
Visiting usc for graduation.

423
00:18:55,155 --> 00:18:57,570
And they thought tuition
was a bitch.

424
00:18:57,605 --> 00:18:59,985
Same neighborhood, m.o.,
victim profile.

425
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,117
Hey, Claudette...

426
00:19:04,251 --> 00:19:07,237
You need to be back
at the office on spin control.

427
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:07,867
We got this.

428
00:19:07,902 --> 00:19:09,504
You're not
used to a short leash?

429
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:10,960
I'm fine.

430
00:19:12,322 --> 00:19:14,177
I saw what happened!

431
00:19:14,469 --> 00:19:17,856
I was right over there,
and I saw it all.

432
00:19:17,891 --> 00:19:20,100
You need
to stop snitchin', bitch!

433
00:19:20,135 --> 00:19:21,972
Why you helping one time?!

434
00:19:22,007 --> 00:19:25,022
You need to mind your mouth
and get back to your mama!

435
00:19:25,057 --> 00:19:26,784
You a straight rat,
you old fool!

436
00:19:26,819 --> 00:19:28,094
Stop snitchin'!

437
00:19:28,129 --> 00:19:30,592
I lived in that building
for 40 years,

438
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:34,409
and I seen these young folks
turn these streets into living hell!

439
00:19:34,444 --> 00:19:35,409
No snitchin'!

440
00:19:35,444 --> 00:19:37,969
Why don't you let us
take you back to the station,

441
00:19:38,004 --> 00:19:40,495
where you can make a statement
someplace quiet?

442
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:41,972
For safety?

443
00:19:42,007 --> 00:19:43,379
I'm not scared.

444
00:19:43,414 --> 00:19:45,664
I'm too old for scared.

445
00:19:45,699 --> 00:19:47,880
My sons are in jail.

446
00:19:47,915 --> 00:19:50,980
My lesbian daughter
won't give me grandchildren.

447
00:19:51,015 --> 00:19:52,752
They want to kill me?

448
00:19:52,787 --> 00:19:56,378
I can't wait
to see my Jesus.

449
00:19:56,413 --> 00:19:58,220
Did you get a look
at the shooter?

450
00:19:58,255 --> 00:20:02,226
There were two,
and they were in Gray do-rags.

451
00:20:02,261 --> 00:20:03,117
Spook street.

452
00:20:03,152 --> 00:20:05,259
You just told me
you ruled them out.

453
00:20:05,294 --> 00:20:07,332
Jamal lied his ass off,
and I bought it.

454
00:20:07,367 --> 00:20:09,478
Can you give us a physical
description of these men?

455
00:20:09,513 --> 00:20:10,997
Age, height, tattoos?

456
00:20:11,032 --> 00:20:12,447
They wasn't no men.

457
00:20:12,482 --> 00:20:16,074
They were like 13 or 14...
Maybe.

458
00:20:16,109 --> 00:20:21,143
They were babies...
Babies on bicycles.

459
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:23,196
Hey, Moses!

460
00:20:24,692 --> 00:20:25,955
Yo!

461
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:28,310
The shooters are spook street.
Case closed.

462
00:20:28,345 --> 00:20:29,572
Now, call up your boys
in county.

463
00:20:29,607 --> 00:20:31,553
They need to be on the lookout
for this Armenian dude.

464
00:20:31,588 --> 00:20:32,822
His name is rezian.

465
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:34,170
Byz lats is looking
to put him down.

466
00:20:34,205 --> 00:20:35,483
Only you're not
gonna let that happen.

467
00:20:35,518 --> 00:20:36,675
So get off the weed

468
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:39,937
and get on the phone
with your boys in county.

469
00:20:40,917 --> 00:20:43,563
You have a window
that faces the street.

470
00:20:43,598 --> 00:20:44,788
You didn't see
what happened?

471
00:20:44,823 --> 00:20:46,067
I always
keep my blinds closed.

472
00:20:46,102 --> 00:20:47,276
Even on a hot day
like today?

473
00:20:47,311 --> 00:20:49,617
When I'm in my apartment,
I like to be naked.

474
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:52,269
Thanks.
Excuse me.

475
00:20:52,304 --> 00:20:53,662
Where'd you get those?

476
00:20:53,697 --> 00:20:55,464
From that man.

477
00:20:55,499 --> 00:20:57,232
Oh, come on.

478
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:08,066
Hey, Asher, take this lying
piece of shit Jamal upstairs.

479
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:10,111
Hey, guys.
What a surprise.

480
00:21:10,146 --> 00:21:12,086
Busy day.
What's going on?

481
00:21:12,121 --> 00:21:15,278
Why do you have somebody
watching us and following us?

482
00:21:15,313 --> 00:21:17,536
You didn't get a tip
from some banger in county.

483
00:21:17,571 --> 00:21:19,732
Mara told me
about the whole Armenian thing

484
00:21:19,767 --> 00:21:20,995
you and shane
are mixed up with.

485
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,863
- NOw, what's the truth?
- HEy, calm down.

486
00:21:22,898 --> 00:21:24,696
Let's not do this here, okay?
Come on.

487
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:26,956
Cass, don't move.

488
00:21:29,895 --> 00:21:31,356
What the hell is going on?

489
00:21:32,223 --> 00:21:33,207
I'm handling it.

490
00:21:33,242 --> 00:21:36,790
Oh, handling it is by tying up
Mara and gagging her?

491
00:21:37,997 --> 00:21:40,420
That's a gross exaggeration.

492
00:21:40,455 --> 00:21:43,124
Look, shane got
both of our families in a jam,

493
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:45,793
which I am currently
getting us all out of.

494
00:21:45,828 --> 00:21:48,408
- I Need you...
- tRust you, right?

495
00:21:49,523 --> 00:21:51,887
We were working
an undercover job.

496
00:21:51,995 --> 00:21:54,596
Believe me, you don't want
to know the details.

497
00:21:54,631 --> 00:21:56,975
Now,
Shane used bad judgment.

498
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:58,838
That's why you have some ex-cop
following me?

499
00:21:58,873 --> 00:22:00,405
He's just there to...

500
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,571
He's just there to make sure
you're all right.

501
00:22:06,467 --> 00:22:07,692
Look...

502
00:22:09,725 --> 00:22:12,629
...the truth is,
something might be going down.

503
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,246
I want to move you guys
to a hotel.

504
00:22:14,281 --> 00:22:15,829
I don't believe this.
I'm done.

505
00:22:15,842 --> 00:22:17,405
I'm going to connecticut...
My cousin's.

506
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,452
I need you to stay in town

507
00:22:18,487 --> 00:22:21,059
where me and my guys
can look out for you.

508
00:22:21,463 --> 00:22:24,377
If you think I would let anyone
hurt you or my children,

509
00:22:24,412 --> 00:22:26,837
you don't know me.

510
00:22:30,142 --> 00:22:31,430
Do you work here?

511
00:22:31,465 --> 00:22:33,772
Eight hours a day,
minus half-hour for lunch.

512
00:22:33,807 --> 00:22:36,080
You need some change
for the vending machine?

513
00:22:36,115 --> 00:22:37,737
I want someone arrested
for a crime.

514
00:22:37,772 --> 00:22:39,384
Yeah?
Who's that, sweetheart?

515
00:22:39,747 --> 00:22:41,202
My father.

516
00:22:42,962 --> 00:22:45,788
Got a call claiming
responsibility for the murders.

517
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:47,449
We already know
it's spook street.

518
00:22:47,484 --> 00:22:50,671
Caller confirms it's spook
street working with Al-qaeda.

519
00:22:51,338 --> 00:22:52,828
Al-qaeda in the hood?

520
00:22:52,863 --> 00:22:54,579
This is serious.

521
00:22:54,819 --> 00:22:57,586
Knock yourself out.
But it's bullshit.

522
00:22:57,621 --> 00:22:59,247
I've seen the FBI report.

523
00:22:59,282 --> 00:23:00,873
There's internet chatter.

524
00:23:00,973 --> 00:23:03,984
Terrorist groups are trying to
get in business with local street gangs.

525
00:23:04,019 --> 00:23:05,576
We're rolling
on internet rumors now?

526
00:23:05,611 --> 00:23:09,050
Hell, on the internet, Dutch boy
is still a 13-year-old girl

527
00:23:09,085 --> 00:23:10,690
looking
for her first training bra.

528
00:23:10,725 --> 00:23:13,703
Terrorists funding their operations
by selling drugs and weapons

529
00:23:13,738 --> 00:23:15,781
to gang members
who deal drugs and weapons...

530
00:23:15,816 --> 00:23:17,477
How is that a stretch?

531
00:23:17,512 --> 00:23:20,392
Look, we spend all day,
every day, in the barrio.

532
00:23:20,427 --> 00:23:22,553
That's just not
what's going on.

533
00:23:22,588 --> 00:23:24,645
How does it look
if we do nothing

534
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,606
and, God forbid,
the unthinkable happens?

535
00:23:27,641 --> 00:23:30,218
It's the world
we're living in now.

536
00:23:32,629 --> 00:23:33,524
All right.

537
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:35,292
We'll work the international
terrorist angle.

538
00:23:35,327 --> 00:23:37,026
We've already notified
homeland security.

539
00:23:37,061 --> 00:23:39,366
They'll be taking over
from here.

540
00:23:41,385 --> 00:23:42,500
When the men from u.n.c.I.E.

541
00:23:42,535 --> 00:23:44,762
Are cruising alvarado
looking for osama,

542
00:23:44,797 --> 00:23:50,301
I'll be sweating some good, old-fashioned,
trash-talking American dipshit.

543
00:24:04,062 --> 00:24:05,405
Jamal...

544
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,659
Lying to me
is unacceptable.

545
00:24:07,694 --> 00:24:10,577
Man, I told you the truth
and nothing but the truth.

546
00:24:10,612 --> 00:24:13,461
Yeah, with the most high
as your witness. I know.

547
00:24:13,496 --> 00:24:14,460
Only I got a witness, too,

548
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:16,300
saw the shooters
in spook street colors.

549
00:24:16,335 --> 00:24:17,940
Then there's some niggas
out there false flaggin'.

550
00:24:17,975 --> 00:24:19,448
Listen, shithead!

551
00:24:19,483 --> 00:24:21,382
The feds are gonna be here
in a minute.

552
00:24:21,417 --> 00:24:23,247
Once they get here,
I can't help you.

553
00:24:23,282 --> 00:24:25,499
Oh, white people get shot,
and it's a federal case now?

554
00:24:25,534 --> 00:24:28,219
Oh, we're way past
black and white.

555
00:24:30,184 --> 00:24:33,216
Which means you got a rainbow
coalition of law enforcement

556
00:24:33,251 --> 00:24:35,358
shitting
multicultural bricks.

557
00:24:35,393 --> 00:24:38,032
Look, I gots no love
for them sand niggas.

558
00:24:38,067 --> 00:24:40,724
I claim black man south central
east side rider.

559
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:43,382
Well, you're gonna be
the only cat in guantanamo

560
00:24:43,417 --> 00:24:45,177
praying in that direction.

561
00:24:45,212 --> 00:24:47,237
The rest of your homies
for life,

562
00:24:47,272 --> 00:24:49,507
they'll have
their asses in the air,

563
00:24:49,542 --> 00:24:51,708
noses in the carpet,
facing mecca,

564
00:24:51,743 --> 00:24:54,429
and there ain't no calm pills
in gitmo.

565
00:24:54,436 --> 00:24:56,785
I gave no order.

566
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:59,798
Some "g," unaffiliated,
outside my set, does a deed...

567
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:01,680
How's that on me?

568
00:25:01,715 --> 00:25:04,911
The shooters were baby g's.
They were kids.

569
00:25:07,118 --> 00:25:07,886
What?

570
00:25:07,921 --> 00:25:10,285
We was watching cnn.
I made a joke.

571
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,649
You know,
you want to stir shit up,

572
00:25:12,684 --> 00:25:14,400
say you riding
with Al-qaeda,

573
00:25:14,435 --> 00:25:16,081
taking flight on a white man.

574
00:25:16,116 --> 00:25:18,577
Bad shit happens to him
or one of his blonde breezies,

575
00:25:18,612 --> 00:25:21,039
that's all anybody talks
about... period, point blank.

576
00:25:21,074 --> 00:25:21,829
You're the boss.

577
00:25:21,864 --> 00:25:24,822
Someone took your joke
as an order. Who?

578
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:27,306
Some kid called my phone
from the barbershop,

579
00:25:27,341 --> 00:25:28,433
talking crazy shit.

580
00:25:28,468 --> 00:25:30,180
I didn't pay it no mind.

581
00:25:30,215 --> 00:25:31,666
I need a name. Who?

582
00:25:31,701 --> 00:25:33,083
Psh! I don't know, man.

583
00:25:33,118 --> 00:25:35,592
Some little shorty
always underfoot.

584
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:38,116
Step out of the room,
detective.

585
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,119
What time
did you get this call?

586
00:25:40,529 --> 00:25:42,272
About 2:30.

587
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,350
Hey.

588
00:25:47,385 --> 00:25:49,403
I need to look
at Jamal tillman's property.

589
00:25:49,438 --> 00:25:50,676
Tillman.

590
00:25:50,928 --> 00:25:53,318
Hey! Cut the shit!

591
00:25:54,577 --> 00:25:55,864
Here you go.

592
00:26:01,387 --> 00:26:02,642
Great. Thank you.

593
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,438
Hi.
I'm detective Vendrell.

594
00:26:06,704 --> 00:26:08,290
I need to speak
to Mr. Grubman.

595
00:26:08,325 --> 00:26:09,590
No visits.

596
00:26:09,625 --> 00:26:10,919
I'm the arresting officer.

597
00:26:10,954 --> 00:26:13,075
I just need to speak with him
before his deposition.

598
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:15,162
Sorry. I'm not supposed to
allow anyone in that room.

599
00:26:15,197 --> 00:26:18,141
Look, we have reason to believe
he may have been threatened.

600
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:21,056
He recants his previous
statements to us under duress,

601
00:26:21,091 --> 00:26:23,828
an Armenian mob boss
goes free.

602
00:26:23,863 --> 00:26:26,225
Now, you want that
on your resum? Rookie??

603
00:26:26,582 --> 00:26:28,438
Look, you're just
trying to do your job.

604
00:26:28,473 --> 00:26:30,398
Why don't you
come in with me?

605
00:26:30,433 --> 00:26:32,010
Hi, Mr. Grubman.

606
00:26:32,045 --> 00:26:34,111
You're the cop
who arrested rezian.

607
00:26:34,146 --> 00:26:35,619
Yes, I was.

608
00:26:35,654 --> 00:26:37,222
They have you
down here today, too?

609
00:26:37,257 --> 00:26:40,324
I'm always working. I, uh...

610
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:43,138
I came to thank you
for testifying.

611
00:26:43,173 --> 00:26:46,246
We're very confident
in our case against Mr. Rezian.

612
00:26:46,281 --> 00:26:47,717
Just trying
to do the right thing.

613
00:26:47,752 --> 00:26:49,770
Is there anything else
that we can get you

614
00:26:49,805 --> 00:26:51,641
to make you
more comfortable?

615
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:53,246
No, I'm fine.

616
00:26:53,281 --> 00:26:55,191
And we'd all like for it
to stay that way.

617
00:26:55,226 --> 00:26:56,574
Okay.

618
00:26:57,317 --> 00:27:01,948
We don't want you to have
any fears about testifying.

619
00:27:02,423 --> 00:27:03,998
We're not gonna let any harm
come to you

620
00:27:04,033 --> 00:27:06,381
or your daughter
down in anaheim.

621
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,642
My daughter?

622
00:27:07,677 --> 00:27:08,572
Well, when we heard
about the death threat,

623
00:27:08,607 --> 00:27:11,790
we took every precaution
to guarantee katrona's safety.

624
00:27:12,158 --> 00:27:14,158
You have my word.

625
00:27:16,913 --> 00:27:20,593
Now, is there
any part of your testimony...

626
00:27:20,628 --> 00:27:25,547
That you would like to go over
so that we're clear?

627
00:27:26,552 --> 00:27:27,605
No.

628
00:27:28,693 --> 00:27:31,420
I'm perfectly clear
on what I need to say.

629
00:27:31,509 --> 00:27:32,804
Great.

630
00:27:33,898 --> 00:27:35,457
Great.

631
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:51,231
I might be able to help I.c.E.
Think locally and act globally.

632
00:27:51,266 --> 00:27:52,539
You interested?

633
00:27:52,574 --> 00:27:55,364
I'm a big-picture gal.
Of course I'm interested.

634
00:27:55,399 --> 00:27:58,155
Look, I got the name and address
of an illegal alien

635
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:59,928
who's running weapons.

636
00:27:59,963 --> 00:28:02,351
He's a fired
Mexican intel op

637
00:28:02,386 --> 00:28:05,379
who's a possible connection
to a local power player.

638
00:28:05,414 --> 00:28:08,373
Now, this goes international,
be better for you than me.

639
00:28:08,408 --> 00:28:09,759
What's his name?

640
00:28:14,057 --> 00:28:15,734
Aramboles?

641
00:28:15,769 --> 00:28:17,196
Don't know him.

642
00:28:17,231 --> 00:28:18,623
You're about to.

643
00:28:20,507 --> 00:28:23,680
I'd get there now
before someone else does.

644
00:28:26,427 --> 00:28:28,181
Grubman's got a bad case
of amnesia.

645
00:28:28,216 --> 00:28:29,914
What about rezian in jail?

646
00:28:29,949 --> 00:28:31,200
Well, he's still alive,
as far as I know.

647
00:28:31,235 --> 00:28:32,626
Can't really call him up and ask

648
00:28:32,661 --> 00:28:34,017
and hour later,
he takes a knife.

649
00:28:34,661 --> 00:28:36,760
Yeah, well, just have to trust
that Moses' guys

650
00:28:36,795 --> 00:28:38,293
are gonna keep him breathing.

651
00:28:38,328 --> 00:28:39,569
Claudette needs to see you in her office.

652
00:28:39,604 --> 00:28:42,814
- IN a sec.
- NOt you. Shane.

653
00:28:53,004 --> 00:28:54,375
Uh, you beckoned?

654
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:56,075
I got a call from the D.A.,

655
00:28:56,663 --> 00:28:59,592
said you just visited the
witness, rezian's bookkeeper?

656
00:28:59,627 --> 00:29:00,302
Yeah.

657
00:29:00,337 --> 00:29:02,457
Yeah, my jailhouse chats
with rezian,

658
00:29:02,492 --> 00:29:04,943
he didn't seem too worried
about grubman as a witness,

659
00:29:04,978 --> 00:29:06,529
which didn't give me
a good feeling.

660
00:29:06,564 --> 00:29:09,183
You didn't talk to grubman
about his testimony, did you?

661
00:29:09,218 --> 00:29:11,803
Just to make sure he wasn't
being pressured in any way.

662
00:29:12,474 --> 00:29:14,461
Sheriff's deputy
was present the whole time.

663
00:29:14,496 --> 00:29:15,741
I know.
I just spoke with her.

664
00:29:15,776 --> 00:29:19,134
Grubman's changed his story.
He's recanted everything.

665
00:29:19,169 --> 00:29:20,557
Shit.
Rezian got to him.

666
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:21,911
D.A. Wants to talk to you,

667
00:29:21,946 --> 00:29:23,178
make sure
you didn't have a hand in it.

668
00:29:23,213 --> 00:29:26,250
How does it benefit me to lose a
high-profile collar like rezian?

669
00:29:26,285 --> 00:29:28,173
I haven't
figured that out yet.

670
00:29:28,208 --> 00:29:29,400
Well, tell the D.A.

671
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:32,812
I'm available
to talk to him anytime.

672
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,536
Dutch.

673
00:29:40,422 --> 00:29:42,635
Look, I've spoken
to my people twice now.

674
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:44,751
Is there a chance
that nobody saw anything?

675
00:29:44,786 --> 00:29:46,798
No, see, some people
would rather stay cowards,

676
00:29:46,833 --> 00:29:49,635
keep their mouths shut, and not
put themselves on the line.

677
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:51,151
You got a problem with me?

678
00:29:51,186 --> 00:29:53,404
Because if you do, why don't you
just let it out now?

679
00:29:53,439 --> 00:29:54,516
I don't konw.
You tell me.

680
00:29:54,551 --> 00:29:56,815
Or you gonna keep your mouth shut
like the rest of these people?

681
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:58,500
Right. Right.

682
00:29:58,535 --> 00:29:59,884
Unis are saying
that you blame me

683
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:02,913
because the guy cut out the back
at the army-surplus bust.

684
00:30:02,948 --> 00:30:04,489
Is that what all this
roundabout shit is?

685
00:30:04,524 --> 00:30:05,673
Where there's smoke,
there's fire.

686
00:30:05,708 --> 00:30:08,114
You didn't clear a room, and
a cop could have gotten hurt.

687
00:30:08,149 --> 00:30:10,935
I cleared the rooms
I was supposed to clear.

688
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:13,281
You want to think it was me
because you don't like me?

689
00:30:13,316 --> 00:30:14,389
Fine.

690
00:30:14,424 --> 00:30:16,552
But it was you
who pulled out a gun today

691
00:30:16,587 --> 00:30:19,669
because you didn't think
that I can handle the job.

692
00:30:20,417 --> 00:30:22,080
Or were you just scared?

693
00:30:25,415 --> 00:30:27,470
Guess we should all, uh...

694
00:30:28,374 --> 00:30:30,538
Get back at it.

695
00:30:35,624 --> 00:30:37,062
You lil b. K?

696
00:30:37,097 --> 00:30:38,500
Who "axing"?

697
00:30:39,163 --> 00:30:41,575
Jamal "axing"
from the joint.

698
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:44,136
Mal ain't trying to put my name
in his mouth,

699
00:30:44,171 --> 00:30:45,679
talking to no police.

700
00:30:45,714 --> 00:30:48,007
You called his cell
right before he was arrested.

701
00:30:48,042 --> 00:30:49,227
I ain't make no call.

702
00:30:49,262 --> 00:30:51,809
Your number's
on his phone, little asshole.

703
00:30:51,844 --> 00:30:54,356
Look, a number
ain't nothing but a number.

704
00:30:54,391 --> 00:30:56,340
You want stripes
with these 187s,

705
00:30:56,375 --> 00:30:58,254
you got to name them
and claim them.

706
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:00,434
No one steps up, spook street
doesn't make the top 10.

707
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,211
Maybe one niners start
whispering they're the ones

708
00:31:02,246 --> 00:31:03,983
with bowling balls swinging
between their legs.

709
00:31:04,018 --> 00:31:06,431
Or you go down in hood lore

710
00:31:06,466 --> 00:31:09,610
as the punk who earned Jamal
a 20-year stretch

711
00:31:09,645 --> 00:31:12,909
as an accessory for something
he knew nothing about...

712
00:31:12,944 --> 00:31:16,748
Since the phone call ties him
to the shootings.

713
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:23,067
Yeah, it was me and my boys
who blasted them fools!

714
00:31:23,102 --> 00:31:24,680
Jamal wasn't knowing.

715
00:31:24,715 --> 00:31:27,185
It was my own ingenuity shit.

716
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,637
My shit!

717
00:31:29,412 --> 00:31:32,707
So, what we gonna do now,
slow man?

718
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:35,734
Man...

719
00:31:41,036 --> 00:31:43,244
Reppin'
that spook street, my nig!

720
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:45,798
That's what's up!
S-p-to the double-o-k!

721
00:31:45,833 --> 00:31:46,995
Yo, take my picture!

722
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,656
I merked them slobs straight up!

723
00:31:49,282 --> 00:32:10,253
Spook street!

724
00:32:15,977 --> 00:32:18,001
Meet Al-qaeda's
number two and three.

725
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:20,959
Want me to call juvie,
or you want to waterboard them?

726
00:32:24,506 --> 00:32:25,649
Hey, Vic,
you got a minute?

727
00:32:25,684 --> 00:32:26,733
Not really.

728
00:32:26,768 --> 00:32:28,356
It's about your daughter.

729
00:32:30,566 --> 00:32:32,879
Cassidy wanted to file charges
against you today.

730
00:32:32,914 --> 00:32:34,652
She made
some pretty crazy claims.

731
00:32:34,687 --> 00:32:36,355
I just thought
you should know.

732
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:38,704
Said that you assaulted
Vendrell's wife?

733
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:42,184
You don't buy your kids
a cellphone these days,

734
00:32:42,219 --> 00:32:44,060
they want you dead.

735
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,175
Who else did she talk to?

736
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:47,298
Just me.
I didn't write it up.

737
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:49,176
I figured it was just a kid
acting out.

738
00:32:49,211 --> 00:32:50,863
Hey, thanks
for the heads-up.

739
00:32:50,898 --> 00:32:53,947
You know, I got girls of my own.
It's a living hell.

740
00:32:54,742 --> 00:32:55,998
You should take the time...

741
00:32:56,033 --> 00:32:57,731
Talk to her, though.

742
00:33:03,025 --> 00:33:04,715
You're not really thinking
of keeping these people

743
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,900
in the Barn overnight,
are you?

744
00:33:05,935 --> 00:33:07,131
I'm allowed 24 hours.

745
00:33:07,166 --> 00:33:09,388
As fatigue sets in,
someone will crack.

746
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:12,201
You sure
this isn't about someone else?

747
00:33:13,387 --> 00:33:15,983
Billings may have gotten to me
a little today.

748
00:33:16,018 --> 00:33:18,580
He's selling them food
from his vending machines.

749
00:33:18,615 --> 00:33:20,547
He hasn't done anything
to help solve this,

750
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:22,122
and he's making a profit.

751
00:33:22,157 --> 00:33:23,280
You deal with it.

752
00:33:23,315 --> 00:33:25,109
If he sees his lawsuit through
to the bitter end,

753
00:33:25,144 --> 00:33:28,272
he's not going anywhere
any time soon.

754
00:33:28,484 --> 00:33:31,118
And send these people home.

755
00:33:36,744 --> 00:33:39,114
If you made one move that
even approached competence,

756
00:33:39,149 --> 00:33:40,290
this would look
a lot different.

757
00:33:40,325 --> 00:33:41,863
You think I don't know
how you and missus feel,

758
00:33:41,898 --> 00:33:43,688
that you want me to quit?

759
00:33:43,723 --> 00:33:45,767
Well, I'm getting my pension...
Every penny of it.

760
00:33:45,918 --> 00:33:47,918
God! Is that
all you want?

761
00:33:47,953 --> 00:33:49,936
That and
the tiniest bit of respect.

762
00:33:49,971 --> 00:33:51,698
For what, Steve?

763
00:33:51,733 --> 00:33:53,573
You give that
to a man... respect...

764
00:33:53,608 --> 00:33:55,379
You earn his hard work
and loyalty.

765
00:33:55,414 --> 00:33:57,006
That's what management here
doesn't understand.

766
00:33:57,041 --> 00:33:59,587
You show a little
r-E-s-p-E-c-t,

767
00:33:59,622 --> 00:34:03,444
and people will do
almost anything to...

768
00:34:03,479 --> 00:34:06,452
Nacio.
The building manager.

769
00:34:06,487 --> 00:34:07,946
Nacio?

770
00:34:08,569 --> 00:34:11,172
You assume people
are indifferent, lazy.

771
00:34:11,207 --> 00:34:14,540
Maybe they just found someone
worth protecting.

772
00:34:20,529 --> 00:34:21,660
Knock it off!

773
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,803
I'm sorry to have kept
all of you here so long.

774
00:34:28,263 --> 00:34:30,586
It's important to find out
what happened to that girl.

775
00:34:30,621 --> 00:34:31,961
I meant to ask you earlier,

776
00:34:31,974 --> 00:34:35,800
how long have you been the
manager of the building, nacio?

777
00:34:35,835 --> 00:34:37,953
This august,
it'll be one year.

778
00:34:37,988 --> 00:34:40,664
Apartment managers
aren't usually well-liked.

779
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:42,221
Seems like you are.

780
00:34:42,256 --> 00:34:44,802
Well, I made a lot of changes
around the building.

781
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:46,569
Get things fixed right away,

782
00:34:46,604 --> 00:34:48,551
even if it means fighting
with the landlord.

783
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:49,787
It's the little things
that matter.

784
00:34:49,788 --> 00:34:51,171
Right.

785
00:34:51,206 --> 00:34:53,485
Why do you think
nobody's come forward?

786
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,525
They don't know anything.

787
00:34:55,917 --> 00:34:57,951
They're worried about
the trouble it could bring.

788
00:34:57,986 --> 00:35:00,113
A lot of them
don't have papers.

789
00:35:00,148 --> 00:35:02,007
Any other reason?

790
00:35:02,815 --> 00:35:04,424
Well, they're mad...

791
00:35:04,459 --> 00:35:06,952
About the noise, the smoke.

792
00:35:06,987 --> 00:35:09,622
They complained to the police
over and over,

793
00:35:09,657 --> 00:35:12,879
but in that neighborhood,
it's tough to get a response.

794
00:35:12,914 --> 00:35:14,091
You told me today

795
00:35:14,126 --> 00:35:16,349
you didn't know anything
about the complaints.

796
00:35:16,384 --> 00:35:20,234
Well, I-I've been
talking to, uh...

797
00:35:20,269 --> 00:35:24,429
The people down here,
since we were waiting.

798
00:35:24,464 --> 00:35:27,108
Where were you
when it happened again?

799
00:35:27,635 --> 00:35:29,268
At the hardware store.

800
00:35:29,303 --> 00:35:30,866
- Rlght.
- Broken toilet.

801
00:35:30,901 --> 00:35:32,627
And then you came back
after the murder.

802
00:35:32,662 --> 00:35:34,354
And you put the bag
with the pipe down,

803
00:35:34,389 --> 00:35:36,329
- came out to talk to us.
- Yeah.

804
00:35:36,364 --> 00:35:38,174
So if we drove you back
to the apartment right now,

805
00:35:38,209 --> 00:35:40,348
you could show
that bag to us.

806
00:35:42,088 --> 00:35:43,911
If I can remember
where I put it.

807
00:35:43,946 --> 00:35:46,034
It's been a crazy day.

808
00:35:47,806 --> 00:35:50,135
There's an old saying,
nacio...

809
00:35:51,111 --> 00:35:54,349
If you never lie, you never
have to remember anything.

810
00:35:55,532 --> 00:35:58,135
I don't think
you meant to kill lana.

811
00:35:58,675 --> 00:36:01,758
Look, it was your building.
You worked hard to keep it nice.

812
00:36:02,273 --> 00:36:04,645
Probably asked those rockers
politely.

813
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,317
But they didn't listen,
did they?

814
00:36:06,352 --> 00:36:08,987
What were you trying to do with
the cinder block, scare them?

815
00:36:09,715 --> 00:36:12,295
You killed someone, nacio.

816
00:36:12,818 --> 00:36:14,753
You didn't intend to...

817
00:36:15,376 --> 00:36:16,847
But you did.

818
00:36:17,487 --> 00:36:21,597
And all those people out there
aren't talking for one reason.

819
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:25,707
Because you're the only guy that
makes their lives any better.

820
00:36:27,482 --> 00:36:30,217
Isn't it time
to send those people home?

821
00:36:36,003 --> 00:36:37,796
Where's the boy's mother?

822
00:36:37,831 --> 00:36:41,045
Sucking your man's dick
'cause you won't, bitch.

823
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:44,260
I've advised my client
not to answer any questions.

824
00:36:44,295 --> 00:36:46,760
Shit, nigga,
I got something to say.

825
00:36:46,795 --> 00:36:49,226
We smoked them fools
all day long,

826
00:36:49,261 --> 00:36:51,129
all three of them.

827
00:36:51,164 --> 00:36:52,441
Why?

828
00:36:52,816 --> 00:36:54,538
Just paying the white devil
his due.

829
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:55,946
No more talk.

830
00:36:55,981 --> 00:36:58,988
You working
my last nerve, nigga.

831
00:36:59,779 --> 00:37:02,858
We was bringing the ghetto
heisman back to spook street.

832
00:37:02,893 --> 00:37:03,868
Like back in the day.

833
00:37:03,882 --> 00:37:06,018
You realize
that killing innocent people

834
00:37:06,053 --> 00:37:09,362
because of the color
of their skin is a hate crime?

835
00:37:09,515 --> 00:37:12,702
You say it
like I give a shit, nigga.

836
00:37:12,737 --> 00:37:15,890
Haters taught hate.
That's why I bang it.

837
00:37:16,905 --> 00:37:19,452
This word
you're so fond of using...

838
00:37:19,832 --> 00:37:22,711
You're one of them "n-word"
type of bitches, huh?

839
00:37:22,746 --> 00:37:25,556
You use that word,
you turn a person into a thing.

840
00:37:25,591 --> 00:37:29,819
Makes it easier for you to
rob them, hate them, kill them.

841
00:37:29,854 --> 00:37:31,565
Do I got to listen
to this church up in here

842
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,789
from this nigga bitch?!

843
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:39,079
Do you realize how many
black folks have fought and died

844
00:37:39,114 --> 00:37:42,209
to give us the opportunity
they never had?!

845
00:37:42,244 --> 00:37:44,264
Mm, four? Five?

846
00:37:44,299 --> 00:37:47,072
Not only
have you taken innocent lives,

847
00:37:47,107 --> 00:37:49,868
but you turned yourself
into a thing.

848
00:37:49,903 --> 00:37:52,594
You can't
even say the word, bitch.

849
00:37:52,629 --> 00:37:56,057
White man even got you talking
by his rules now.

850
00:37:56,092 --> 00:37:56,760
Straight up.

851
00:37:56,795 --> 00:37:58,946
I wouldn't
waste the word "nigger"

852
00:37:58,981 --> 00:38:03,331
on someone
as empty and godless as you.

853
00:38:03,774 --> 00:38:07,259
Too many of our people
have died

854
00:38:07,294 --> 00:38:10,709
being treated like niggers...

855
00:38:10,744 --> 00:38:14,099
For me to belittle
their suffering.

856
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:19,282
Yo, just make sure
the streets know

857
00:38:19,317 --> 00:38:22,752
spook street nigs
merked them devils!

858
00:38:24,975 --> 00:38:26,901
They're filing a complaint
against me?

859
00:38:26,936 --> 00:38:29,417
They're alleging that you used
a racist epithet

860
00:38:29,452 --> 00:38:32,781
to intimidate
and harass the suspect.

861
00:38:32,816 --> 00:38:35,480
- IT didn't happen.
- THe lawyer said he witnessed it.

862
00:38:35,515 --> 00:38:38,145
Oh, he's taking what I said
completely out of context.

863
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:40,264
So, you did use the word.

864
00:38:40,299 --> 00:38:43,004
Some crack-baby tweener
does a triple homicide,

865
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:45,710
and I'm the one
being held over a barrel?

866
00:38:49,072 --> 00:38:51,686
You let him get to you.

867
00:38:51,721 --> 00:38:54,425
Listen, all that's gonna
come of this

868
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:57,130
is a rainforest worth
of paperwork

869
00:38:57,165 --> 00:38:58,348
and some chest-thumping.

870
00:38:58,383 --> 00:39:01,383
At my expense.

871
00:39:02,175 --> 00:39:04,590
I'll look at it for you.

872
00:39:06,657 --> 00:39:10,403
You ever feel like you're being
pulled right back into something

873
00:39:10,438 --> 00:39:12,840
that you have worked so hard for
for so long...

874
00:39:12,875 --> 00:39:13,767
Don't even go there.

875
00:39:13,802 --> 00:39:15,376
I got to work out a plea.

876
00:39:15,411 --> 00:39:18,250
The defendant dumped
boiling water on her baby

877
00:39:18,285 --> 00:39:22,705
because the father came home
with a hickey on his neck.

878
00:39:24,313 --> 00:39:28,651
Tell Mackey and his guys
good collar.

879
00:39:29,481 --> 00:39:30,541
Hey.

880
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:34,115
That had to hurt.

881
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:35,637
Everything hurts.

882
00:39:35,672 --> 00:39:37,134
New meds doing anything?

883
00:39:37,169 --> 00:39:40,411
Beside the fact they make you
want to jump out of your skin.

884
00:39:41,366 --> 00:39:42,589
I heard your guy confessed.

885
00:39:42,624 --> 00:39:45,599
Yeah??
Brass have to be pleased

886
00:39:45,634 --> 00:39:47,140
to get these killer kids
off the street.

887
00:39:47,175 --> 00:39:48,074
No, no,
they're too busy

888
00:39:48,109 --> 00:39:51,424
trying to plot how to hang me
out to dry for being a racist.

889
00:39:51,459 --> 00:39:54,740
Deflect attention from their
Al-qaeda thing not panning out.

890
00:39:54,775 --> 00:39:57,197
So, uh,
you're a racist now?

891
00:39:58,273 --> 00:40:00,017
How's that
working out for you?

892
00:40:01,878 --> 00:40:03,110
Those are federal agents

893
00:40:03,145 --> 00:40:06,088
finding your arsenal
of illegal weapons.

894
00:40:06,296 --> 00:40:10,195
With enhancements, that ought
to earn you 18 to 25 years.

895
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:11,747
On another front,
your boss thinks

896
00:40:11,782 --> 00:40:15,028
you sold his blackmail intel
to the armenians.

897
00:40:15,063 --> 00:40:17,704
That's the definition
of a bad day.

898
00:40:17,739 --> 00:40:20,345
Coyote's waiting
to take you across.

899
00:40:20,586 --> 00:40:24,377
Even found you a casa
with a little mountain view.

900
00:40:24,412 --> 00:40:26,169
You like goat's milk?

901
00:40:26,701 --> 00:40:28,580
I got your boss so worked up,

902
00:40:28,615 --> 00:40:31,902
his orders were for me
to shoot you on sight.

903
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,613
You ever
try to come back here,

904
00:40:33,648 --> 00:40:35,959
it'll be a race between
the feds, the cartel, and me

905
00:40:35,994 --> 00:40:38,335
to catch your ass.

906
00:40:52,609 --> 00:40:55,088
Hasta la vista, shithead.

907
00:40:57,544 --> 00:41:01,386
Now we just need Moses to come
through on the rezian front.

908
00:41:01,421 --> 00:41:02,618
Hey.

909
00:41:03,373 --> 00:41:06,848
You and me... we're on the road
to being cool, right?

910
00:41:10,343 --> 00:41:11,887
Look, I handled aramboles
for you.

911
00:41:12,549 --> 00:41:15,460
I saved your wife and kid
from an assassin.

912
00:41:17,884 --> 00:41:21,578
I'm not your whipping boy
for life, man.

913
00:41:22,325 --> 00:41:24,481
That's what you got
Ronnie for.

914
00:41:26,953 --> 00:41:29,564
Mara ran her mouth
to Corrine,

915
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:33,078
got her all revved up
about this Armenian crap.

916
00:41:33,113 --> 00:41:34,492
I don't need her
starting trouble

917
00:41:34,527 --> 00:41:38,009
when I'm dealing with shit
coming out of both of my ears.

918
00:41:39,028 --> 00:41:41,084
Handle your wife.

919
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:42,688
And as far as you
making it sound like

920
00:41:42,723 --> 00:41:45,300
- I owe you for anything...
- County jail.

921
00:41:45,335 --> 00:41:46,420
Yeah.

922
00:41:47,386 --> 00:41:48,732
Okay.

923
00:41:49,204 --> 00:41:51,970
I hold you responsible
for this.

924
00:41:52,005 --> 00:41:55,000
Who do you think made sure the
Mexicans didn't finish the job?

925
00:41:55,437 --> 00:41:56,997
I warned you
about the threat.

926
00:41:57,032 --> 00:42:00,086
I put those bangers on
the payroll to protect you.

927
00:42:00,121 --> 00:42:01,390
'Cause those brothers
sure as hell

928
00:42:01,425 --> 00:42:04,290
didn't pull that
shiv-wielding ese off your ass

929
00:42:04,325 --> 00:42:07,156
to fulfill some
community-service requirement.

930
00:42:08,337 --> 00:42:10,772
I want the Mexican
who did this to me.

931
00:42:10,807 --> 00:42:13,182
I don't even know
that the order was Mexican.

932
00:42:13,534 --> 00:42:15,363
The latino crime bosses
need you out of the way

933
00:42:15,398 --> 00:42:18,945
so that they can get on
with their Brown revolution.

934
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:22,492
But diro is my first choice,
as previously discussed.

935
00:42:22,718 --> 00:42:25,071
And I wouldn't rule somebody out
in your own circle

936
00:42:25,106 --> 00:42:26,816
looking to spread
their wings.

937
00:42:26,851 --> 00:42:28,846
I want who did this to me.

938
00:42:28,881 --> 00:42:30,842
Well,
I'll get right on that.

939
00:42:31,473 --> 00:42:34,049
But the one thing
that we did learn tonight...

940
00:42:34,407 --> 00:42:38,326
I may be the only friend
that you can trust now.

941
00:42:45,865 --> 00:42:47,968
Aramboles vanished.

942
00:42:49,342 --> 00:42:50,418
Where?

943
00:42:50,939 --> 00:42:53,182
It looks like he took the money
from selling your intel

944
00:42:53,217 --> 00:42:55,556
and booked himself
a sea Cruise.

945
00:42:55,969 --> 00:42:58,581
Been a bad 24 hours for you.

946
00:42:59,433 --> 00:43:03,459
You lost aramboles.
Your hit on rezian failed.

947
00:43:03,823 --> 00:43:05,326
He's walking.

948
00:43:05,361 --> 00:43:08,393
He's one pissed-off
eastern euro peon.

949
00:43:09,192 --> 00:43:11,171
He'll be harder
to get to now.

950
00:43:11,477 --> 00:43:12,777
I can help.

951
00:43:13,717 --> 00:43:16,656
But this 30-day-trial bullshit
is over.

952
00:43:16,691 --> 00:43:18,726
I want tenure.

953
00:43:19,429 --> 00:43:22,098
You owe me for your badge.

954
00:43:22,339 --> 00:43:24,244
You got my hearing delayed.

955
00:43:24,279 --> 00:43:27,472
I found out who aramboles
was flipping your intel to.

956
00:43:27,507 --> 00:43:28,615
Even steven.

957
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:31,090
Anything else
is subject to my availability

958
00:43:31,125 --> 00:43:33,469
and new negotiations.

959
00:43:35,156 --> 00:43:36,916
10 grand a week.

960
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:40,170
Any attacks on the armos
go through me first.

961
00:43:40,714 --> 00:43:44,321
And no civilians get killed.

962
00:43:44,356 --> 00:43:45,784
Wars are messy.

963
00:43:45,819 --> 00:43:48,122
I like a buck
as much as the next guy.

964
00:43:48,157 --> 00:43:49,499
Can't feel good
about spending it

965
00:43:49,534 --> 00:43:52,638
when some schoolgirl's
collateral damage in a drive-by.

966
00:43:52,714 --> 00:43:54,877
Because you've got morals.

967
00:43:54,912 --> 00:43:56,291
A few.

968
00:43:57,484 --> 00:43:59,473
$10,000 is a lot...

969
00:43:59,508 --> 00:44:03,307
Especially if someone's morals
might get in the way.

970
00:44:03,746 --> 00:44:07,698
A call girl gets a fraction of
that to leave hers at the door.

971
00:44:08,458 --> 00:44:10,832
Then get your answers
from a hooker.

972
00:44:10,867 --> 00:44:14,675
I don't like being told
how to conduct my business.

973
00:44:15,144 --> 00:44:18,021
Only two things I know
about how you make a living...

974
00:44:18,557 --> 00:44:21,413
Employees get well paid
to get their hands dirty

975
00:44:21,448 --> 00:44:22,987
so you don't have to.

976
00:44:23,954 --> 00:44:26,183
And before you raise up
a new building,

977
00:44:26,218 --> 00:44:29,277
the old one
has to get torn down.

978
00:44:30,776 --> 00:44:32,172
So?

979
00:44:32,207 --> 00:44:36,025
So, 10 grand buys you
a one-man demolition crew.

980
00:44:39,108 --> 00:44:41,216
I'll need your answer
in the morning.

981
00:44:41,251 --> 00:44:45,702
Welcome to www.1000fr.com
