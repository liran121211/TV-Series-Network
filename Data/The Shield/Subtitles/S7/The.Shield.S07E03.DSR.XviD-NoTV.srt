1
00:00:01,168 --> 00:00:03,118
Previously on "The Shield"...

2
00:00:04,295 --> 00:00:05,401
what happened?

3
00:00:05,402 --> 00:00:06,339
I've got lupus.

4
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,246
I've had it for 15 years.

5
00:00:07,247 --> 00:00:09,674
You dropped a grenade in
his lap, and what did you do?

6
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:12,594
Shane!

7
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:13,442
I killed Lem.

8
00:00:13,443 --> 00:00:14,643
Leave here before I kill you.

9
00:00:15,436 --> 00:00:17,973
Vendrell: just imagine every
wrong thing we have ever done.

10
00:00:18,606 --> 00:00:21,435
If anything happens to me,
that lands on I.A.D.'S doorstep.

11
00:00:23,662 --> 00:00:24,862
The armenians know
about the money train!

12
00:00:25,263 --> 00:00:26,565
Diro greenlit your family.

13
00:00:26,817 --> 00:00:28,601
I'm paying off your debt in favors.

14
00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:29,968
What the hell have you gotten us into?!

15
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:31,362
This will handle the first week.

16
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:33,572
I need you to look after
Corrine and my family.

17
00:00:33,823 --> 00:00:34,729
This is cruz pezuela.

18
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:35,930
He's representing a
local development company

19
00:00:36,702 --> 00:00:39,695
That has backing in various
mexican investment interests.

20
00:00:39,862 --> 00:00:41,062
The mexican mob is buying up farmington?

21
00:00:41,462 --> 00:00:43,624
Blackmail
- That's how pezuela's getting everyone

22
00:00:44,668 --> 00:00:46,350
Onboard the train to cartel town.

23
00:00:46,517 --> 00:00:48,879
I can't tackle cruz alone,
so there's got to be trust.

24
00:00:49,288 --> 00:00:51,248
You and I have the only
two copies of the keys.

25
00:00:51,415 --> 00:00:53,834
There are over 100
blackmail files in this box,

26
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:55,201
And I only need one of
them to get my badge back.

27
00:00:55,692 --> 00:00:58,044
This intel is the proof that
we have that pezuela's dirty.

28
00:00:58,211 --> 00:01:00,641
Using it as leverage will
compromise it as evidence.

29
00:01:00,893 --> 00:01:03,310
I'm gonna need you to get my
family clear of this thing.

30
00:01:03,705 --> 00:01:04,979
I need you to make Rezian believe

31
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:07,504
The mexicans are the
armenians' worst problem.

32
00:01:07,671 --> 00:01:08,871
The latino crime bosses
need you out of the way

33
00:01:09,171 --> 00:01:11,318
So that they can get on
with their brown revolution.

34
00:01:11,569 --> 00:01:12,409
I am going to protect you.

35
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:14,060
Anything happens to me,

36
00:01:14,294 --> 00:01:16,963
I've already given the order to
go after your friend's family.

37
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,589
We got to figure out how many
rungs on the armenian ladder

38
00:01:19,756 --> 00:01:21,070
Know about our
money-Train rip-Off.

39
00:01:21,237 --> 00:01:22,437
Hey, you and me
- On the road to being cool, right?

40
00:01:24,537 --> 00:01:27,987
Working with you to protect
my family? I'm down with that.

41
00:01:28,295 --> 00:01:29,495
Trusting you?

42
00:01:32,487 --> 00:01:33,687
Not there yet.

43
00:01:38,124 --> 00:01:39,555
If there's a bug
hidden, this'll find it.

44
00:01:39,807 --> 00:01:40,936
Rezian: that's unnecessary.

45
00:01:40,937 --> 00:01:42,787
Yeah, tell it to the feds.

46
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:02,077
Heard about the city's
new top-10 gang list?

47
00:02:02,258 --> 00:02:04,766
Word is they're holding a spot
for a local armenian kingpin.

48
00:02:04,933 --> 00:02:06,133
Feds would like to beat them to it.

49
00:02:06,311 --> 00:02:08,387
Since father and daughter
kesakian are gone,

50
00:02:08,554 --> 00:02:09,626
I guess that means you.

51
00:02:09,627 --> 00:02:10,827
It's safe. You're wasting your time.

52
00:02:10,866 --> 00:02:13,047
Well, up until now,
we've been slow-Dancing.

53
00:02:13,268 --> 00:02:14,468
If we're gonna slip into bed,
I'm gonna need some protection.

54
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:17,128
So...

55
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,638
I got a real job, so anytime you want

56
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,066
To get started.

57
00:02:22,067 --> 00:02:22,977
Your job will have to wait.

58
00:02:22,978 --> 00:02:24,546
I've got something
you need to do for me.

59
00:02:24,713 --> 00:02:26,970
It better be quick. I got a
lot on my plate these days.

60
00:02:27,137 --> 00:02:28,337
Your police department is about
to destroy its confiscated guns.

61
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:30,552
Yeah, I know about it.

62
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:32,066
It's an annual thing.

63
00:02:32,317 --> 00:02:32,820
We want them.

64
00:02:32,821 --> 00:02:34,021
I'm sure the swat team
guarding that shipment

65
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:36,991
Won't have a problem
with me taking a few.

66
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:38,739
The guns are stored
before they're moved.

67
00:02:38,991 --> 00:02:41,262
Find out where and get to them first.

68
00:02:41,429 --> 00:02:44,098
You can get them anywhere
else a hell of a lot easier.

69
00:02:44,265 --> 00:02:46,634
Those guns have been processed, cleaned.

70
00:02:46,801 --> 00:02:49,551
Thanks to your city,
they're untraceable now.

71
00:02:49,718 --> 00:02:51,529
I got to pass on this favor.

72
00:02:51,696 --> 00:02:53,146
You have no choice.

73
00:02:53,897 --> 00:02:55,132
I don't need a choice.

74
00:02:55,299 --> 00:02:56,000
The answer's no.

75
00:02:56,001 --> 00:02:57,201
You just killed your
friend and his family.

76
00:02:57,609 --> 00:02:58,809
You know what?

77
00:02:59,852 --> 00:03:01,405
Go ahead
- Kill mackey.

78
00:03:01,572 --> 00:03:02,331
Kill his whole family!

79
00:03:02,332 --> 00:03:04,576
I'm not going on some career
suicide mission for you!

80
00:03:04,743 --> 00:03:05,943
I'm not gonna spend the rest of my life

81
00:03:06,425 --> 00:03:08,594
With somebody else's debt
hanging around my neck, either.

82
00:03:08,761 --> 00:03:11,090
You said that we would be
compensated for our loss.

83
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:12,457
How about saving your
ass in county jail?!

84
00:03:14,085 --> 00:03:15,051
Huh?!

85
00:03:15,052 --> 00:03:16,252
That slip your mind?!

86
00:03:16,303 --> 00:03:17,503
Moneycompensation.

87
00:03:17,521 --> 00:03:18,202
Those guns are a down payment.

88
00:03:18,203 --> 00:03:19,403
Those guns are a tall order.

89
00:03:19,647 --> 00:03:22,091
I need fair market value for
the risk that I'd be taking.

90
00:03:22,258 --> 00:03:23,944
I'll come up with something,

91
00:03:24,111 --> 00:03:25,311
But you got to tell me what
you need these gatts for.

92
00:03:25,694 --> 00:03:27,644
We'll move them out of state.

93
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:39,109
That's all you need to know.

94
00:03:39,276 --> 00:03:40,693
Interesting strategy.

95
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,714
"Kill his whole family. "
It's the smartest thing we've

96
00:03:43,881 --> 00:03:44,880
Done with these assholes, Vic.

97
00:03:44,881 --> 00:03:46,081
I gave us a chance to end all of this.

98
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,010
By putting a truckload
of untraceable weapons

99
00:03:50,177 --> 00:03:51,746
In the hands of God knows who?

100
00:03:51,913 --> 00:03:53,439
I put us in a place, finally,

101
00:03:53,606 --> 00:03:55,401
To ensuring that your kids stay alive.

102
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:58,319
By letting innocents get
killed somewhere else.

103
00:03:58,978 --> 00:04:00,162
We don't know that.

104
00:04:00,163 --> 00:04:02,141
Look, Rezian's negotiating with us now.

105
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:03,782
We still don't know who in Rezian's crew

106
00:04:04,034 --> 00:04:05,244
Knows about my money-Train debt.

107
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:08,187
I don't see him volunteering
that anytime soon.

108
00:04:08,354 --> 00:04:09,504
We have no choice.

109
00:04:09,505 --> 00:04:12,355
Until we figure out
exactly how deep the threat

110
00:04:13,192 --> 00:04:15,193
Against my family goes,
we got to play ball

111
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:15,953
With them.

112
00:04:15,954 --> 00:04:17,338
So, all we got to do is hijack

113
00:04:17,615 --> 00:04:19,965
The department's annual p. R. Bonanza.

114
00:04:20,132 --> 00:04:21,332
Maybe we don't have to steal the guns.

115
00:04:22,267 --> 00:04:23,836
Maybe somebody gives them to us.

116
00:04:24,003 --> 00:04:25,353
Yeah, how's that?

117
00:04:30,159 --> 00:04:31,709
I got a card to play.

118
00:04:50,562 --> 00:04:51,721
Vic: morning.

119
00:04:51,722 --> 00:04:52,513
You shouldn't have come here.

120
00:04:52,514 --> 00:04:54,364
Where's that blackmail box?

121
00:04:54,533 --> 00:04:56,676
The one we were supposed
to only access together?

122
00:04:56,843 --> 00:04:59,220
See, I knew you couldn't
resist the temptation

123
00:04:59,387 --> 00:05:00,454
To use it for your own purposes.

124
00:05:00,455 --> 00:05:01,639
The very fact that you're
here now just proves it.

125
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,890
So, you took it?

126
00:05:03,057 --> 00:05:04,377
Yeah, I'm in control of it

127
00:05:04,544 --> 00:05:06,712
Until the time is right
to turn it over to justice.

128
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:08,945
I don't have time to
bullshit around here!

129
00:05:09,112 --> 00:05:11,175
Hey, we're still working together.

130
00:05:11,342 --> 00:05:14,692
The only change is that I'm
now in possession of the box.

131
00:05:14,859 --> 00:05:17,709
We're close to drawing
pezuela out of his hole

132
00:05:17,876 --> 00:05:21,108
And into the light of day, and
that only works if he thinks

133
00:05:21,275 --> 00:05:22,441
The box is still out there.

134
00:05:22,442 --> 00:05:24,192
And that hasn't changed.

135
00:05:25,316 --> 00:05:27,066
Look, if pezuela's smart,

136
00:05:27,233 --> 00:05:29,575
He hasn't had any contact
with anyone in that box,

137
00:05:29,742 --> 00:05:31,919
So I have to link him
directly to the cartel

138
00:05:32,086 --> 00:05:33,286
Or all you're doing is
giving the feds ammunition

139
00:05:34,365 --> 00:05:37,215
To destroy the careers
of everyone in that box.

140
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:38,892
Before one of them has a
chance to save your job, right?

141
00:05:46,428 --> 00:05:49,212
When you finally turn
it back over to justice,

142
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:51,056
They're gonna wonder
what took you so long.

143
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:54,290
I was trying to understand
exactly what I had -

144
00:05:54,457 --> 00:05:56,224
Determine who put it all together.

145
00:05:56,391 --> 00:05:57,591
I could tell them that,

146
00:05:57,687 --> 00:06:00,022
Or I could tell them that you're
just another dirty politician

147
00:06:00,189 --> 00:06:02,415
Trying to extort his way
into the mayor's office.

148
00:06:02,582 --> 00:06:04,932
You'd only be incriminating yourself.

149
00:06:05,184 --> 00:06:07,134
Yeah, but I'm on the way out.

150
00:06:07,301 --> 00:06:08,501
You could still maintain the lie,

151
00:06:09,413 --> 00:06:10,689
Keep yourself distanced from all this -

152
00:06:12,444 --> 00:06:15,994
That is, if I'm willing to tell
the right story on that day.

153
00:06:16,205 --> 00:06:17,855
Don't look for the box.

154
00:06:19,565 --> 00:06:20,915
You won't find it.

155
00:06:21,601 --> 00:06:23,251
I don't need the box...

156
00:06:24,374 --> 00:06:25,574
I have you.

157
00:06:29,824 --> 00:06:31,259
How did that card play out?

158
00:06:31,426 --> 00:06:32,019
It didn't.

159
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,220
If this is gonna happen,
it's gonna be the hard way.

160
00:06:33,744 --> 00:06:35,551
Did you find out where
the guns are stored?

161
00:06:35,718 --> 00:06:37,769
Department's kept them in
five different locations.

162
00:06:38,595 --> 00:06:40,302
I'm about to get roasted.

163
00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:41,669
They gotta be in the same place.

164
00:06:41,797 --> 00:06:42,863
The question is which one?

165
00:06:42,864 --> 00:06:45,440
It might seem obvious
if we start asking right

166
00:06:45,607 --> 00:06:46,807
Before the guns get jacked.

167
00:06:46,859 --> 00:06:49,709
We got to know that we
have a deal with Rezian.

168
00:06:58,369 --> 00:06:59,569
Who is this?

169
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:00,786
Vic mackey.

170
00:07:03,892 --> 00:07:05,142
Why is he here?

171
00:07:05,309 --> 00:07:07,090
Vendrell: if you want those guns,

172
00:07:07,342 --> 00:07:08,521
I can't do it alone.

173
00:07:08,522 --> 00:07:09,722
He's got more motivation
to succeed than anybody.

174
00:07:10,507 --> 00:07:12,346
Going after my family got my attention,

175
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,727
But I'm gonna defend
them one way or the other.

176
00:07:14,894 --> 00:07:16,094
He stole from us once.

177
00:07:16,142 --> 00:07:16,987
Why trust him?

178
00:07:16,988 --> 00:07:18,866
You shouldn't - I took
your money-Train cash,

179
00:07:19,033 --> 00:07:20,812
And I'm not afraid to come
here and tell you about it,

180
00:07:21,064 --> 00:07:23,468
But we both know I just
stole what you already stole.

181
00:07:23,635 --> 00:07:24,637
You and who else?

182
00:07:24,638 --> 00:07:25,838
Me, my buddy Lem, who's dead,

183
00:07:28,238 --> 00:07:29,780
And two of his homies from out of town.

184
00:07:30,226 --> 00:07:32,236
I couldn't find them now if I wanted to.

185
00:07:32,403 --> 00:07:33,603
Shane and my partner, Ronnie
- They had nothing to do with it.

186
00:07:35,053 --> 00:07:36,253
Maybe we just kill you, then.

187
00:07:36,694 --> 00:07:37,996
The foot-Chopping generation
is dead and buried.

188
00:07:38,433 --> 00:07:39,709
You filled the vacuum, but you're new.

189
00:07:40,903 --> 00:07:43,997
You're consolidating power,
and you've got a mexican threat

190
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:46,909
You don't understand and
can't defend yourself from.

191
00:07:47,076 --> 00:07:48,276
Then you can give us our money back.

192
00:07:49,953 --> 00:07:52,203
Sorry, we burned through the money,

193
00:07:52,498 --> 00:07:55,648
But I can offer a, uh,
solution that benefits us all.

194
00:07:56,057 --> 00:07:56,725
End this now.

195
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,100
First, I need to know

196
00:07:58,393 --> 00:07:59,593
Where the guns are headed
once we've delivered them.

197
00:08:00,405 --> 00:08:02,655
They're going to chicago by train.

198
00:08:03,722 --> 00:08:06,672
We need to see a light
at the end of this tunnel,

199
00:08:07,032 --> 00:08:09,982
So, instead of the $2
million that I don't have,

200
00:08:10,149 --> 00:08:12,299
I'm gonna grant you three wishes.

201
00:08:12,466 --> 00:08:13,666
The guns can be wish number one.

202
00:08:13,752 --> 00:08:16,602
Use your wishes well
- Be a lot more valuable

203
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,850
Than the missing cash,
but once you've had

204
00:08:21,017 --> 00:08:23,867
Your three meals, you
walk away from the table

205
00:08:24,034 --> 00:08:25,234
Fat, happy, and even.

206
00:08:25,321 --> 00:08:26,521
He doesn't give us terms.

207
00:08:26,588 --> 00:08:29,301
The talk is your war with
the mexicans is heating up.

208
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:32,918
You're gonna need more help,
you're gonna need more intel.

209
00:08:33,478 --> 00:08:35,428
Trust me or not, that's your

210
00:08:45,674 --> 00:08:46,874
Best offer.

211
00:08:47,811 --> 00:08:51,161
Rezian's buying it for now,
but that asshole khalulian's

212
00:08:51,328 --> 00:08:52,289
Nothing but trouble.

213
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:54,292
I know. First, we'll get
the guns out of storage.

214
00:08:54,459 --> 00:08:56,761
After that, we'll find out
exactly where they're going.

215
00:08:56,928 --> 00:08:58,335
Who cares where they're going?

216
00:08:58,502 --> 00:08:59,119
I care.

217
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,320
Look, you know who we're dealing with.

218
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,857
If the armenians want guns,
they're gonna get them -

219
00:09:03,024 --> 00:09:04,224
If not from us, from someplace else.

220
00:09:04,326 --> 00:09:05,526
The most important thing
is I have finally found us

221
00:09:07,262 --> 00:09:09,912
A light at the end of
this goddamn tunnel.

222
00:09:12,517 --> 00:09:13,767
Vendrell: hey.

223
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,138
What can I do for you guys?

224
00:09:17,305 --> 00:09:18,505
Well, you can help me
save my partner's ass.

225
00:09:20,073 --> 00:09:21,375
We had a gun that should
have been stored in evidence.

226
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,089
Somehow, my partner let
it slip into the pile

227
00:09:26,256 --> 00:09:28,558
That's headed for the
smith & wesson wienie roast,

228
00:09:28,725 --> 00:09:31,077
And now the asshole who
wounded two people in a robbery

229
00:09:31,244 --> 00:09:33,945
Got himself a retrial
- We need the gun back.

230
00:09:34,188 --> 00:09:35,447
I'm sorry, you're too late.

231
00:09:35,699 --> 00:09:36,899
Guns aren't supposed to
be destroyed for two days.

232
00:09:37,532 --> 00:09:39,518
True, but they're locked
up at the impound yard

233
00:09:39,685 --> 00:09:40,885
Over on san fernando right now.

234
00:09:41,419 --> 00:09:42,662
There's almost 8,000
loose guns in that pile.

235
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:48,658
You think you're gonna find
one serial number in all that?

236
00:09:49,203 --> 00:09:50,012
Shit.

237
00:09:50,013 --> 00:09:51,213
Looks like the d. A. Will
have to get by on his charm

238
00:09:53,349 --> 00:09:55,599
Instead of limping by on forensics.

239
00:09:59,028 --> 00:10:02,078
Steve, there's a girl here
about a missing person.

240
00:10:02,245 --> 00:10:03,445
So give her the paperwork.

241
00:10:03,593 --> 00:10:05,352
She filled it out yesterday.

242
00:10:05,603 --> 00:10:06,803
I think there's some new information.

243
00:10:07,479 --> 00:10:09,281
Well, I'm about to jump
into something else.

244
00:10:09,448 --> 00:10:10,521
The crossword puzzle?

245
00:10:10,522 --> 00:10:11,722
Jumble, actually.

246
00:10:11,858 --> 00:10:12,443
Just give it to Dutch.

247
00:10:12,444 --> 00:10:13,644
If it's got legs, I'll hop on board.

248
00:10:14,052 --> 00:10:16,612
Dutch, there's a young woman outside
- Marisol griego.

249
00:10:16,779 --> 00:10:17,979
Some missing girl is her friend
- Wan lee, 16.

250
00:10:19,766 --> 00:10:20,966
16?

251
00:10:21,869 --> 00:10:22,510
Try runaway.

252
00:10:22,511 --> 00:10:23,711
You think your friend wan was abducted?

253
00:10:25,146 --> 00:10:28,150
I was meeting her after
school to get something to eat.

254
00:10:28,317 --> 00:10:30,219
She passed me on her
scooter trying to park.

255
00:10:30,386 --> 00:10:32,963
I saw somebody, a man,
push her into an suv.

256
00:10:34,278 --> 00:10:35,580
An officer called
wan's mother yesterday,

257
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:40,419
Was told she wasn't missing
- Said it was a mistake.

258
00:10:40,586 --> 00:10:41,786
Wan hasn't been at school.

259
00:10:42,703 --> 00:10:44,456
She missed a midterm today.

260
00:10:44,623 --> 00:10:47,273
Sometimes kids don't
want to go to school.

261
00:10:47,492 --> 00:10:48,692
Wan's 4.0.

262
00:10:48,726 --> 00:10:50,004
She wants to go to stanford.

263
00:10:50,171 --> 00:10:51,371
Something happened to her.

264
00:10:58,271 --> 00:10:59,471
Mrs. Lee?

265
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:00,942
I'm detective wagenbach.

266
00:11:00,973 --> 00:11:02,333
Are you wan lee's mother?

267
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,700
A friend of wan's is concerned.

268
00:11:04,967 --> 00:11:06,243
She hasn't heard from
her in a couple of days.

269
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,330
I already spoke to the police.

270
00:11:10,497 --> 00:11:11,697
I told them there was no problem.

271
00:11:12,132 --> 00:11:14,212
I still have a
missing-Person's report on file.

272
00:11:14,464 --> 00:11:15,836
If I could just talk to her,

273
00:11:16,003 --> 00:11:17,203
Close it out, get out of your way.

274
00:11:17,322 --> 00:11:18,572
She's not here.

275
00:11:18,739 --> 00:11:19,489
Where is she?

276
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:21,400
Come back when my son is home.

277
00:11:21,567 --> 00:11:22,767
Well, I'd rather do this now.

278
00:11:23,565 --> 00:11:25,515
She went away for a few days.

279
00:11:25,767 --> 00:11:27,881
Okay, well, why don't we call her?

280
00:11:28,048 --> 00:11:29,248
You'll have to talk to my son.

281
00:11:30,715 --> 00:11:31,915
Mrs. Lee, is everything all right?

282
00:11:33,236 --> 00:11:34,538
If something's happened
to your daughter -

283
00:11:35,257 --> 00:11:36,807
There's nothing wrong.

284
00:11:37,942 --> 00:11:39,592
We don't need your help.

285
00:11:45,066 --> 00:11:46,266
Thank you.

286
00:11:51,543 --> 00:11:52,856
Says wan's not missing
- Just went away for a few days.

287
00:11:53,656 --> 00:11:54,958
I'd rather spend the limited
time I have on the clock

288
00:11:57,793 --> 00:11:59,005
Investigatingactualcrimes.

289
00:11:59,172 --> 00:12:00,188
The mother's scared, covering -

290
00:12:00,189 --> 00:12:02,599
If you'd gotten your ass out of
the car, you'd have seen that.

291
00:12:02,766 --> 00:12:03,966
How about I take your word for
it and we end this field trip?

292
00:12:14,774 --> 00:12:15,795
Vendrell: hey, Vic.

293
00:12:15,796 --> 00:12:17,180
I'm on san fernando.

294
00:12:17,347 --> 00:12:19,897
If we can get in, we
can drive right out.

295
00:12:20,064 --> 00:12:21,264
The guns must be in
the main warehouse -

296
00:12:21,683 --> 00:12:23,502
Where they keep those expensive rides.

297
00:12:23,669 --> 00:12:24,869
Nothing like a tricked-Out benz.

298
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,822
Rezian was right
- Until the cameras roll,

299
00:12:28,443 --> 00:12:31,593
These guns are nothing but
the department's garbage.

300
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,960
They got one guard inside.

301
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:34,244
Guy couldn't protect his own asshole.

302
00:12:34,615 --> 00:12:35,965
That makes sense.

303
00:12:36,132 --> 00:12:37,332
Budgets are tight all around.

304
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,978
Hey, you rember that
dealer we used once...

305
00:12:40,145 --> 00:12:42,705
blew a hole in his wall
for that murder case?

306
00:12:42,872 --> 00:12:44,072
What was his name?

307
00:12:44,887 --> 00:12:45,649
Burnout, wasn't it?

308
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:46,096
That sounds right.

309
00:12:46,097 --> 00:12:46,717
Why?

310
00:12:46,718 --> 00:12:47,918
I saw him driving a few days ago.

311
00:12:47,992 --> 00:12:49,192
Guy got himself a brand-New escalade.

312
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,023
Business must be good.

313
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:53,390
All right, I'll track him
down and get back to you.

314
00:12:55,466 --> 00:12:56,861
Why the mysterious invite?

315
00:12:57,028 --> 00:13:00,378
We've been working a local
armenian crew from the inside.

316
00:13:00,545 --> 00:13:03,071
Our c. I. Tipped us off
about a major gun heist

317
00:13:03,401 --> 00:13:06,051
That's about to land
- You want in on it?

318
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,910
Think it's as good as your last lead?

319
00:13:09,162 --> 00:13:10,307
Sounds like it's better.

320
00:13:10,308 --> 00:13:11,508
Probably took a lot of effort
to get your name in so deep.

321
00:13:12,565 --> 00:13:14,336
Anybody else would be trying to keep

322
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:16,470
That lid screwed on
as tight as possible.

323
00:13:16,637 --> 00:13:18,706
Yeah, well, I'm not anybody else.

324
00:13:18,873 --> 00:13:21,023
No, you're one of those rare cops

325
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:22,810
Who likes to share his spoils.

326
00:13:22,977 --> 00:13:24,177
We're all fighting the same war, right?

327
00:13:26,342 --> 00:13:28,292
My father always warned me -

328
00:13:28,459 --> 00:13:31,309
A boy does you one favor,
maybe he's just nice,

329
00:13:31,476 --> 00:13:34,822
But if he does two favors, he's
either trying to put his hand

330
00:13:34,989 --> 00:13:36,357
On your wallet or down your panties.

331
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:37,724
I'll bet your daddy had to
beat the boys away with a stick.

332
00:13:39,814 --> 00:13:43,464
A louisville slugger, actually,
and he wasn't afraid to use it.

333
00:13:43,631 --> 00:13:46,015
And no one's gonna hang
anything over my head,

334
00:13:46,182 --> 00:13:47,382
So if you think sharing a couple busts

335
00:13:47,654 --> 00:13:50,504
Gives you the right to
something, think again.

336
00:13:50,671 --> 00:13:51,871
In case you haven't heard,

337
00:13:52,038 --> 00:13:54,290
I'm not exactly appreciated around here.

338
00:13:54,457 --> 00:13:55,657
The department's trying to force me out,

339
00:13:56,042 --> 00:13:57,344
So I'm gonna clear away
as much shit off the street

340
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:03,431
As I can before I go, and
I don't give a rat's ass

341
00:14:04,183 --> 00:14:05,428
Who gets the credit for it.

342
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:07,845
You still want in on this, or not?

343
00:14:15,078 --> 00:14:16,278
Hey, captain.

344
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,680
How you doing?

345
00:14:18,965 --> 00:14:19,774
Busy.

346
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,733
You want to tell me what you
wouldn't tell the desk sergeant?

347
00:14:22,227 --> 00:14:24,780
This guy larry
- He's been coming into my porn shop

348
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,063
Wanting to invest in my films.

349
00:14:26,064 --> 00:14:26,905
Who could blame him?

350
00:14:26,906 --> 00:14:27,548
I know about larry.

351
00:14:27,549 --> 00:14:28,749
His main thing is drugs
- Only pays his actresses in coke.

352
00:14:31,895 --> 00:14:33,745
Of course, I threw him out.

353
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:37,006
Because you commit your
smut to a higher standard?

354
00:14:37,173 --> 00:14:38,373
Interested in a drug-Peddling,
money-Laundering asshole?

355
00:14:42,202 --> 00:14:43,402
What happened in the meetings?

356
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,158
I showed him my product.

357
00:14:46,325 --> 00:14:47,158
He wasn't interested.

358
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:49,204
It's not my fault he can't appreciate

359
00:14:49,371 --> 00:14:50,571
The mature female body the way I can.

360
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:51,964
What kind of stuff did
he want to invest in?

361
00:14:54,109 --> 00:14:57,659
Oh, um, guy-Girl, girl-Girl,
three-Way, atm, black-On-White.

362
00:14:59,003 --> 00:15:00,305
If you ever get tired of
squashing people's civil rights,

363
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:03,491
I can make you somerealmoney.

364
00:15:03,658 --> 00:15:04,783
So far, this is working out,

365
00:15:04,784 --> 00:15:07,328
But if something changes,
I'll let you know.

366
00:15:07,495 --> 00:15:08,695
Call larry and set another meeting.

367
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:15,829
Outside?

368
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:18,039
Would you fold tina in with you as bait?

369
00:15:18,366 --> 00:15:19,824
You want us to set up on the porn guy?

370
00:15:19,991 --> 00:15:22,041
Sounds like more a vice thing.

371
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:23,069
It's a drug thing.

372
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:24,337
Larry's got to get his someplace.

373
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:26,222
Follow the coke trail where it leads to.

374
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:27,589
Where's Vic and Shane?

375
00:15:27,798 --> 00:15:29,100
Uh, Vic had a c. I.

376
00:15:29,267 --> 00:15:30,878
He and Shane are following up on it.

377
00:15:31,045 --> 00:15:33,595
Well, if you need bodies, get them back.

378
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,020
I'm gonna need to see
some I.D., burnout.

379
00:15:50,752 --> 00:15:52,402
Mackey, what I do, man?

380
00:15:55,225 --> 00:15:56,425
License.

381
00:16:01,365 --> 00:16:02,565
This is wack.

382
00:16:08,289 --> 00:16:09,489
Registration.

383
00:16:10,456 --> 00:16:11,656
That's a nice ride.

384
00:16:11,674 --> 00:16:12,051
Thank you.

385
00:16:12,052 --> 00:16:13,644
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to take you in

386
00:16:13,811 --> 00:16:15,689
For driving without a
license and registration.

387
00:16:15,856 --> 00:16:18,124
Man, you got both of them
in your goddamn pocket!

388
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:21,741
You start talking back, we're
gonna add a resisting charge.

389
00:16:25,505 --> 00:16:26,705
Reallynice ride.

390
00:16:26,765 --> 00:16:27,704
Make the introductions and shut up.

391
00:16:27,705 --> 00:16:29,374
We'll take it from there.

392
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:30,741
I thought we were meeting up with Vic.

393
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:32,575
What, we can't handle it?

394
00:16:33,179 --> 00:16:34,138
You okay?

395
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:35,742
Yeah, I'm feeling my groove.

396
00:16:35,994 --> 00:16:38,334
Remember to wait for
him to offer the drugs.

397
00:16:38,501 --> 00:16:41,179
Don't ask to be vague, or
else it becomes entrapment.

398
00:16:41,346 --> 00:16:44,590
I was listening the first
time you taught me this stuff.

399
00:16:44,757 --> 00:16:45,873
Let's go.

400
00:16:45,874 --> 00:16:47,040
Larry: about time you got out of that

401
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:48,320
Old, disgusting granny shit.

402
00:16:48,487 --> 00:16:48,943
Glad you approve.

403
00:16:48,944 --> 00:16:50,679
How many scenes you done, hon?

404
00:16:50,846 --> 00:16:52,046
I've only done a couple
of home ones with devon,

405
00:16:53,706 --> 00:16:54,983
But I just got into town a few days ago.

406
00:16:56,068 --> 00:16:57,268
Is that okay?

407
00:16:58,237 --> 00:16:59,487
Yeah, it's okay.

408
00:16:59,725 --> 00:17:00,197
Who's devon?

409
00:17:00,198 --> 00:17:03,144
I'm her boyfriend. We were
hoping to break in together.

410
00:17:05,293 --> 00:17:06,493
Hmm.

411
00:17:07,412 --> 00:17:08,472
Small, but natural.

412
00:17:08,473 --> 00:17:09,528
You done anal yet, sweet thing?

413
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:10,831
I'm waiting for the right material.

414
00:17:10,998 --> 00:17:12,198
Lowe: I was thinking we could

415
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,700
Do a few scenes together until she got

416
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:15,846
More comfortable.

417
00:17:15,847 --> 00:17:17,597
All right, hon, get naked.

418
00:17:18,639 --> 00:17:19,884
Let me see how you suck it.

419
00:17:20,051 --> 00:17:22,201
Axl didn't mention free samples.

420
00:17:23,374 --> 00:17:24,087
This is an audition.

421
00:17:24,088 --> 00:17:27,338
Yeah, well, axl had said
that he had been to you before

422
00:17:28,016 --> 00:17:30,666
And that he always
came back empty-Handed.

423
00:17:31,883 --> 00:17:33,083
Look, I don't get
laid unless I get paid.

424
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,291
This already feels different.

425
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:37,658
I got to know what my
money is buying, okay?

426
00:17:39,743 --> 00:17:40,961
What's the problem, baby?

427
00:17:41,128 --> 00:17:42,328
I'm just a little nervous.

428
00:17:42,356 --> 00:17:43,556
You need something to
help you get in the mood?

429
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:46,533
Yeah, okay.

430
00:17:47,619 --> 00:17:48,819
What do you got?

431
00:17:48,879 --> 00:17:50,079
You got a stage name?

432
00:17:50,355 --> 00:17:51,555
Persuasion.

433
00:17:52,624 --> 00:17:53,824
You like that?

434
00:17:57,544 --> 00:17:58,744
Yeah, I like that.

435
00:17:58,856 --> 00:18:00,056
If those give you an erection
that lasts more than four hours,

436
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:05,584
Call me so I can film it.

437
00:18:05,729 --> 00:18:06,929
And this bag of powder means
I get to tap that ass, too.

438
00:18:11,046 --> 00:18:12,246
Welcome to the world
of adult entertainment.

439
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:15,210
Police!

440
00:18:15,211 --> 00:18:16,411
You're under arrest!

441
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:18,670
Natural... but small.

442
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:32,660
I don't want it touched until
the techies run through it.

443
00:18:32,827 --> 00:18:33,489
Sure thing.

444
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:35,048
Just dump it at farmington.

445
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:36,181
I'll check it out there.

446
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:37,382
Luxury vehicles get
parked at san fernando.

447
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:42,004
Department regulation.

448
00:18:51,114 --> 00:18:52,230
Wherever.

449
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:52,598
Asshole.

450
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:55,349
You know, the way this
cocaine is packaged -

451
00:18:55,535 --> 00:18:58,485
Small quanties
- Buys you a distribution charge.

452
00:18:58,652 --> 00:18:59,837
I don't sell it.

453
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:00,381
I give it away.

454
00:19:00,382 --> 00:19:02,013
It gets a better
performance out of the girls.

455
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:04,991
Then you bought it from somebody
- Who?

456
00:19:08,999 --> 00:19:10,199
Demetrius harms.

457
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:13,462
There's no sense in you taking
the hit if it's harms we want.

458
00:19:13,629 --> 00:19:14,702
You're done now.

459
00:19:14,703 --> 00:19:15,263
Get lost.

460
00:19:15,264 --> 00:19:16,464
Someone gonna take me back to my store?

461
00:19:17,815 --> 00:19:20,365
Call a uni to haul
him back to his place.

462
00:19:24,237 --> 00:19:24,905
Okay, come on.

463
00:19:24,906 --> 00:19:26,556
What do you say, larry?

464
00:19:34,005 --> 00:19:35,350
You want to help yourself out?

465
00:19:35,517 --> 00:19:36,717
Is your son home?

466
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:37,118
No.

467
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:38,319
We went by his market on the
way over here. It's closed?

468
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:40,759
Mrs. Lee, was wan kidnapped?

469
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,464
Wan is not missing.

470
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:44,840
I want to bring wan home safely,

471
00:19:45,093 --> 00:19:47,743
But you're gonna have
to help me help her.

472
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:50,755
Wan!

473
00:19:57,847 --> 00:19:58,906
You're wan?

474
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:00,107
Woman: where should I take her?

475
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:03,691
Just go up the stairs
- Any open interrogation room.

476
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,618
Wan, wan, wan!

477
00:20:11,619 --> 00:20:12,724
I'm sorry, you're gonna
have to wait down here.

478
00:20:12,725 --> 00:20:13,925
No, my
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

479
00:20:14,277 --> 00:20:15,579
Miss johnson from child
protective services

480
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:18,582
Explained your rights.

481
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:19,783
You're just gonna have
to be patient. I'm sorry.

482
00:20:22,768 --> 00:20:23,968
Hey, feel free to sit in.

483
00:20:25,323 --> 00:20:26,289
Dutch.

484
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:26,465
Yeah?

485
00:20:26,466 --> 00:20:28,208
Maybe I should be the
one to talk to her.

486
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:29,575
I don't know, she
seems really shut down.

487
00:20:30,218 --> 00:20:31,418
I think it should be girl to girl.

488
00:20:32,847 --> 00:20:34,297
You trusted a hunch.

489
00:20:35,349 --> 00:20:36,408
Trust mine.

490
00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:37,609
Sofer: I promise you, I'm
just trying to help you.

491
00:20:39,044 --> 00:20:40,346
Wan: then let me go home.

492
00:20:40,513 --> 00:20:42,722
I will as soon as we sort
out where you've been for

493
00:20:42,889 --> 00:20:44,089
The past three days.

494
00:20:44,107 --> 00:20:44,774
I'm here now!

495
00:20:44,775 --> 00:20:45,941
What difference does it make?!

496
00:20:45,942 --> 00:20:47,090
I think that you were kidnapped.

497
00:20:47,091 --> 00:20:48,378
I think your mom paid the ransom.

498
00:20:49,698 --> 00:20:51,648
So you're calling me a liar?

499
00:20:51,815 --> 00:20:53,183
I think you're hiding something.

500
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:55,134
Listen, wan, I know you're tired, okay?

501
00:20:55,301 --> 00:20:56,501
I'm gonna let you go, but...

502
00:20:58,021 --> 00:21:00,271
just answer one thing for me, okay?

503
00:21:00,438 --> 00:21:01,638
If you weren't taken,
what are you so mad about?

504
00:21:03,592 --> 00:21:04,894
And don't tell me it's
because I won't let you leave,

505
00:21:05,961 --> 00:21:07,864
Because I've heard
that you're a nice kid.

506
00:21:08,031 --> 00:21:09,231
I mean, you're a good
student, straight "a's" -

507
00:21:10,482 --> 00:21:12,051
You want to go to stanford, right?

508
00:21:12,218 --> 00:21:13,418
I mean, you have
everything working for you,

509
00:21:15,328 --> 00:21:16,528
So what are you so mad about?

510
00:21:23,304 --> 00:21:26,054
What if I were to tell
you something about me

511
00:21:28,516 --> 00:21:29,752
That nobody else knows?

512
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,119
A few days ago, I was working on a case.

513
00:21:33,165 --> 00:21:36,015
We were arresting some
really dangerous people.

514
00:21:37,026 --> 00:21:39,776
I thought that the
other officers I was with

515
00:21:40,071 --> 00:21:42,721
Had cleared the room
that I was in, but...

516
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:45,701
but somebody was hiding,
and they missed him.

517
00:21:45,868 --> 00:21:47,068
I didn't even see the guy's
face until he was choking me.

518
00:21:49,169 --> 00:21:50,471
I couldn't
- I couldn't get his hands from around my neck.

519
00:21:56,696 --> 00:21:57,896
What happened?

520
00:21:58,013 --> 00:22:00,664
I honestly thought that
I was leaving my baby boy

521
00:22:00,831 --> 00:22:03,434
Without his mother,
and I have never been so

522
00:22:03,601 --> 00:22:06,751
Scared, and at the same
time, I've never been so mad,

523
00:22:07,638 --> 00:22:09,388
And I wanted to kill him.

524
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:12,325
I still do.

525
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,840
They raped me!

526
00:22:30,744 --> 00:22:32,494
Any special instructions?

527
00:22:32,732 --> 00:22:35,082
Man: yeah, the cop said to stay out.

528
00:22:35,249 --> 00:22:37,999
They're waiting for a
tech to run through it.

529
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:39,916
Anything else coming in?

530
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,070
No, it's the last one.

531
00:22:51,913 --> 00:22:53,363
Okay, gonna lock up.

532
00:23:15,989 --> 00:23:16,955
Yeah?

533
00:23:16,956 --> 00:23:17,922
Hey, Vic.

534
00:23:17,923 --> 00:23:18,499
It's ray carlson.

535
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,700
Is matthew supposed to
be outside by himself?

536
00:23:19,909 --> 00:23:20,925
No. Why?

537
00:23:20,926 --> 00:23:22,638
'Cause he just walked out of the house

538
00:23:22,805 --> 00:23:25,011
And took off down the street
- Matthew!

539
00:23:25,178 --> 00:23:26,607
Where's Corrine?

540
00:23:26,774 --> 00:23:28,133
She left about an hour ago.

541
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:28,967
Where's cassidy?

542
00:23:28,968 --> 00:23:30,168
Inside the house with a friend
- Matthew!

543
00:23:31,252 --> 00:23:32,902
Ray, what's going on?!

544
00:23:35,474 --> 00:23:36,307
Matthew!

545
00:23:36,308 --> 00:23:36,841
Carlson?

546
00:23:36,842 --> 00:23:37,991
I'll take him.

547
00:23:37,992 --> 00:23:39,192
I'm a friend of the mackeys.

548
00:23:39,321 --> 00:23:40,712
Whoa, whoa, wait
- Hey, hey!

549
00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:42,514
I don't know who the mackeys are.

550
00:23:42,681 --> 00:23:43,824
I don't know who you are,

551
00:23:43,825 --> 00:23:46,016
But you're not leaving with this kid.

552
00:23:46,183 --> 00:23:46,860
Ray?!

553
00:23:46,861 --> 00:23:48,353
We can let the police figure it out.

554
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,570
Vic, you better get down here.

555
00:23:52,841 --> 00:23:53,800
Oh, shit!

556
00:23:53,801 --> 00:23:55,007
How's that thing going?

557
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:56,527
I got sidetracked.

558
00:23:56,528 --> 00:23:58,420
What's going on where you are?

559
00:23:58,587 --> 00:23:59,696
Caught a little fish
rolling on a bigger one -

560
00:23:59,697 --> 00:24:00,897
Demetrius harms.

561
00:24:00,957 --> 00:24:02,176
We've been trying to nail him

562
00:24:02,343 --> 00:24:03,978
Since he moved out from oakland.

563
00:24:04,145 --> 00:24:05,695
Well, now's our shot.

564
00:24:06,104 --> 00:24:06,870
I can use you.

565
00:24:06,871 --> 00:24:07,280
I'm tied up.

566
00:24:07,281 --> 00:24:09,474
Is there any way you could
squeeze a couple of unis

567
00:24:09,641 --> 00:24:11,023
Without alerting the african queen?

568
00:24:11,275 --> 00:24:13,354
Harms is supposed to be by himself

569
00:24:13,521 --> 00:24:16,071
With one other guy
- I'll make it work.

570
00:24:16,531 --> 00:24:17,614
Sorry to jam you up.

571
00:24:17,615 --> 00:24:18,815
Put him in the van.

572
00:24:18,866 --> 00:24:20,017
We're rollin' on harms now.

573
00:24:20,018 --> 00:24:21,428
Aren't we supposed to process him first?

574
00:24:21,595 --> 00:24:23,063
No time
- Harms is alone or undermanned.

575
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:26,289
He finds out larry's been
burned, that'll change fast.

576
00:24:30,395 --> 00:24:32,745
Hey, they're fine, Vic, don't worry.

577
00:24:34,783 --> 00:24:36,176
What's going on here?!

578
00:24:36,343 --> 00:24:37,383
Are you the father?

579
00:24:37,384 --> 00:24:37,801
Yeah!

580
00:24:37,802 --> 00:24:39,346
Cassidy and ellen were drinking beer

581
00:24:39,513 --> 00:24:42,963
And she had the door closed
- She wasn't watching matthew.

582
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:44,207
Drinking?

583
00:24:44,208 --> 00:24:44,717
Where were you?

584
00:24:44,718 --> 00:24:47,210
I had her parent-Teacher
conference, remember?

585
00:24:47,377 --> 00:24:48,577
So you just left them alone?

586
00:24:48,638 --> 00:24:50,988
Cassidy watches matthew all the time.

587
00:24:51,983 --> 00:24:53,058
It was only for an hour.

588
00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:55,235
How do you think I do everything
around here without you?

589
00:24:55,402 --> 00:24:56,602
Look, I'm a cop.

590
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,262
This is my ex-Wife.

591
00:24:57,263 --> 00:24:59,538
Man: the parents of the other
girl are filing a complaint.

592
00:24:59,705 --> 00:25:01,401
Your wife's got to be processed.

593
00:25:01,568 --> 00:25:02,725
I'll talk to the parents.

594
00:25:02,726 --> 00:25:03,535
I can smooth this out.

595
00:25:03,536 --> 00:25:04,828
I can release the kids to your custody,

596
00:25:04,995 --> 00:25:06,913
But that's about the
best you're gonna do.

597
00:25:07,321 --> 00:25:08,871
We got to take her in.

598
00:25:11,034 --> 00:25:11,966
I'm sorry, man.

599
00:25:11,967 --> 00:25:12,634
Vic!

600
00:25:12,635 --> 00:25:13,420
I'll be right behind you.

601
00:25:13,421 --> 00:25:14,621
We'll straighten this out
at the sheriff's station.

602
00:25:21,713 --> 00:25:23,763
Don't take your eyes off them.

603
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:28,374
Child services took wan to
mission cross for a rape kit.

604
00:25:28,541 --> 00:25:29,560
Okay, good work.

605
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:31,512
Actually, it was Danny
who got her to open up.

606
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,489
The only thing that she
remembers about the house

607
00:25:33,656 --> 00:25:34,856
Is it was empty, but she
could hear a freeway nearby,

608
00:25:35,583 --> 00:25:38,436
And she saw part of a
billboard outside of her window.

609
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:40,953
It was a suntan-Lotion ad in spanish.

610
00:25:41,349 --> 00:25:42,549
I'll check it out.

611
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:47,510
Um... wan's been taken to the hospital.

612
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:52,898
She was sexually assaulted
by her kidnappers.

613
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:56,334
The hospital is gonna do
a post-Assault examination.

614
00:25:56,645 --> 00:25:57,705
You can't do that.

615
00:25:57,706 --> 00:26:00,766
Mrs. Johnson from child
services is gonna be with wan.

616
00:26:00,933 --> 00:26:02,133
Don't worry.

617
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:03,110
Wan will not be alone.

618
00:26:03,111 --> 00:26:05,319
No! Just bring my sister back here!

619
00:26:05,486 --> 00:26:07,215
Well, that
- That's not possible.

620
00:26:07,382 --> 00:26:09,250
This is a criminal investigation now.

621
00:26:09,502 --> 00:26:10,702
There's no kidnapping.

622
00:26:10,753 --> 00:26:11,676
Joe!

623
00:26:11,677 --> 00:26:13,327
I'm gonna get a lawyer.

624
00:26:31,648 --> 00:26:32,229
Yeah?

625
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:32,896
Is the coast clear?

626
00:26:32,897 --> 00:26:33,733
I got caught up.

627
00:26:33,734 --> 00:26:34,374
I had to cut out.

628
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:37,529
You're supposed to be outside
keeping an eye on things.

629
00:26:37,853 --> 00:26:39,403
Corrine got arrested.

630
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:40,770
I had to arrange bail.

631
00:26:40,881 --> 00:26:41,805
Did you get it?

632
00:26:41,806 --> 00:26:42,615
Yeah.

633
00:26:42,616 --> 00:26:43,816
Now I got to get past the guard
blind if I'm gonna get out.

634
00:26:44,834 --> 00:26:48,184
I'm not anywhere near there,
and we got to be there soon.

635
00:26:49,324 --> 00:26:50,874
Fine. I'll handle it.

636
00:26:54,251 --> 00:26:55,701
I'll see you there.

637
00:27:01,479 --> 00:27:02,929
This is Vic mackey.

638
00:27:13,537 --> 00:27:14,787
It's going down.

639
00:27:48,337 --> 00:27:49,537
Try the door.

640
00:27:51,507 --> 00:27:52,707
Yo!

641
00:27:54,281 --> 00:27:55,481
Demetrius!

642
00:27:56,779 --> 00:27:57,979
Demetrius?

643
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,760
Hey!

644
00:28:01,882 --> 00:28:03,281
Aah! Get it off me!

645
00:28:04,608 --> 00:28:05,808
Get him off!

646
00:28:05,921 --> 00:28:07,121
Ahh!

647
00:28:08,569 --> 00:28:09,871
Move in! Move in!

648
00:28:10,123 --> 00:28:11,323
Lowe: take the back!

649
00:28:11,336 --> 00:28:12,536
The place looks empty.

650
00:28:12,577 --> 00:28:13,370
We missed harms.

651
00:28:13,371 --> 00:28:15,621
I need a paramedic at 2489 gorham!

652
00:28:15,897 --> 00:28:17,647
Officer needs assistance!

653
00:28:19,033 --> 00:28:20,233
Shit!

654
00:28:25,507 --> 00:28:26,707
Shit!

655
00:28:32,731 --> 00:28:33,847
Over here.

656
00:28:33,848 --> 00:28:34,748
Pull it in.

657
00:28:34,749 --> 00:28:35,592
I have to close the gate.

658
00:28:35,593 --> 00:28:36,951
Don't worry
- I don't plan on being here long.

659
00:28:37,118 --> 00:28:38,084
I don't care.

660
00:28:38,085 --> 00:28:38,952
Just move it.

661
00:28:38,953 --> 00:28:39,853
Rezian: is that everything?

662
00:28:39,854 --> 00:28:41,444
Vendrell: it's most of them
- Had

663
00:28:41,696 --> 00:28:42,896
To leave a few crates behind.

664
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,550
That should be enough
to wet your whistle.

665
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,810
Vic: hey, is this place secure?

666
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,298
Of course it is.

667
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:52,565
Something doesn't feel right.

668
00:28:52,566 --> 00:28:53,766
Shane tell you the feds
put you on their hit list?

669
00:28:56,462 --> 00:28:59,315
All right, let's get this shit
unloaded and get out of here.

670
00:28:59,482 --> 00:29:03,032
This place is safe. Now, get
over here and help your friend.

671
00:29:04,719 --> 00:29:05,919
That's a police radio.

672
00:29:06,046 --> 00:29:07,246
Jesus christ!

673
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,323
You were set up!

674
00:29:08,324 --> 00:29:11,182
Did you hear me? We got to go now
- Leave the guns!

675
00:29:12,278 --> 00:29:15,528
Your choice, but don't forget
I tried to pull you out.

676
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:24,796
Rez... rez.

677
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,150
Where are you going?

678
00:29:31,504 --> 00:29:32,954
This is ridiculous.

679
00:29:34,959 --> 00:29:36,509
Where are you going?!

680
00:29:38,727 --> 00:29:39,912
Get on the ground!

681
00:29:39,913 --> 00:29:40,846
On the ground!

682
00:29:40,847 --> 00:29:41,489
Down on the ground!

683
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:43,340
Don't move
- Right there!

684
00:29:47,505 --> 00:29:50,055
You got the results of the rape kit yet?

685
00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:51,566
Positive
- Vaginal tearing.

686
00:29:51,733 --> 00:29:53,635
I've been on the phone
with every realtor

687
00:29:53,802 --> 00:29:56,705
Who has a house for sale
within earshot of the freeway.

688
00:29:56,872 --> 00:29:58,855
These three have a partial
view of the billboard wan saw.

689
00:29:59,196 --> 00:30:00,365
Thanks, steve.

690
00:30:00,366 --> 00:30:01,275
Um, interrogation room two.

691
00:30:01,276 --> 00:30:01,776
I'm gonna get my coat.

692
00:30:01,777 --> 00:30:03,320
Forget your coat.

693
00:30:03,518 --> 00:30:04,718
I need you here.

694
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:05,936
I want to follow this through.

695
00:30:06,014 --> 00:30:07,214
Brother's out looking for a lawyer
- I need you here

696
00:30:07,865 --> 00:30:11,115
To keep them apart until we
figure out what we've got.

697
00:30:11,828 --> 00:30:13,028
I'll get the rape book.

698
00:30:13,078 --> 00:30:14,805
Have her start I.D.Ing some suspects.

699
00:30:14,972 --> 00:30:17,922
Maybe the Billings minimum
is all we need today.

700
00:30:23,006 --> 00:30:24,756
It's just like wan said.

701
00:30:25,007 --> 00:30:25,632
Yeah.

702
00:30:25,633 --> 00:30:28,583
Hey, um, that story you
told her in interrogation

703
00:30:29,042 --> 00:30:30,628
About a guy choking you?

704
00:30:30,795 --> 00:30:31,604
Yeah, I made it up.

705
00:30:31,605 --> 00:30:33,290
Did it to draw her out
- It worked.

706
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:34,657
Um, I'm always here, you know,

707
00:30:35,128 --> 00:30:37,678
If you ever want to
talk about something.

708
00:30:37,845 --> 00:30:40,395
I guess I'm a better
liar than I thought.

709
00:30:51,682 --> 00:30:54,232
I bet you're glad you
listened to me now.

710
00:30:55,536 --> 00:30:56,695
What happened?

711
00:30:56,696 --> 00:30:58,732
Did they follow you
or did you bring them?

712
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:01,468
I'm the guy who just saved
your ass from that federal fire.

713
00:31:01,635 --> 00:31:02,601
Because you heard the radio?

714
00:31:02,602 --> 00:31:04,352
Consider yourself lucky.

715
00:31:05,054 --> 00:31:08,004
I got out, but my men
didn't, andi lost the guns.

716
00:31:08,532 --> 00:31:09,732
Andyou stayed out of jail.

717
00:31:09,866 --> 00:31:11,844
So did we
- Unless your boy sold us out.

718
00:31:12,096 --> 00:31:14,747
He didn't, and if you
did, you're both dead.

719
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:17,950
Sending you to jail would
be the worst thing for me.

720
00:31:18,117 --> 00:31:20,486
You'd have nothing to
lose going after my family.

721
00:31:20,653 --> 00:31:21,888
Think the goddamn thing through!

722
00:31:22,055 --> 00:31:24,473
Vic just risked everything
getting you out of there.

723
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,317
If you're blaming us, it just
means you got a blind spot

724
00:31:26,648 --> 00:31:28,461
To whoever it is that's
trying to burn you.

725
00:31:28,628 --> 00:31:31,022
You got a hole in your
organization you better plug

726
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:32,315
Before you accuse me again.

727
00:31:32,316 --> 00:31:33,866
What about khalulian?

728
00:31:34,819 --> 00:31:36,369
He'd never betray me.

729
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,960
We'll see.

730
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,681
You need to grab anything incriminating

731
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,814
And clear it out of here.

732
00:31:43,815 --> 00:31:45,015
No one knows about this place.

733
00:31:45,026 --> 00:31:48,256
Like they didn't know about
the trucking company, right?

734
00:31:48,789 --> 00:31:50,091
You sweep in here?

735
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,555
Uh, yeah, today.

736
00:31:51,556 --> 00:31:52,522
Every room?

737
00:31:52,523 --> 00:31:53,157
Just this room.

738
00:31:53,158 --> 00:31:54,392
This is where we were talking.

739
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,371
Khalulian got an office of his own?

740
00:31:56,538 --> 00:31:59,288
Someplace where he made
a call about tonight?

741
00:32:11,075 --> 00:32:12,275
Over here.

742
00:32:39,587 --> 00:32:42,473
Khalulian might be loyal, but
he's also stupid and careless.

743
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,840
You better hope he didn't
mention your name or ours.

744
00:32:45,408 --> 00:32:46,608
Let's just get out of here.

745
00:32:46,619 --> 00:32:48,879
You dodged the feds
tonight with our help,

746
00:32:49,046 --> 00:32:50,773
But that's just the tip of the iceberg.

747
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,442
You really think the mexicans
are just gonna go away?

748
00:32:53,609 --> 00:32:56,696
They're gonna keep coming
until they get what they want.

749
00:32:56,863 --> 00:32:59,089
And we all saw your idea
of taking precautions.

750
00:32:59,256 --> 00:33:01,600
Can you find out what
the mexicans want from me?

751
00:33:01,767 --> 00:33:04,917
Maybe, but first, I need
to know who's on your crew.

752
00:33:05,471 --> 00:33:08,221
Only the ones that are
close, that you trust.

753
00:33:08,449 --> 00:33:09,742
I'll check them out.

754
00:33:09,909 --> 00:33:12,959
If I don't find anything,
that'll be the end of it.

755
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,359
Thank you.

756
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,877
You set that whole thing up, didn't you?

757
00:33:30,044 --> 00:33:30,886
Without telling me.

758
00:33:30,887 --> 00:33:32,737
Something like that, yeah.

759
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:35,634
And now Rezian is gonna send me a list

760
00:33:35,801 --> 00:33:37,303
With his most trusted crew on it,

761
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:39,505
And everyone who knows anything about us

762
00:33:39,672 --> 00:33:41,482
And the money train is gonna be on it.

763
00:33:41,649 --> 00:33:43,299
I'm trying to help you.

764
00:33:43,466 --> 00:33:44,432
Don't you get that?

765
00:33:44,433 --> 00:33:45,743
You think I would do something

766
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:48,613
That would let those guns
be in play somewhere else?

767
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:51,940
You think that I would let
three random kids in chicago

768
00:33:52,107 --> 00:33:53,299
Get killed just to save my own?

769
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:56,320
So, now khalulian's busted
- Maybe he doesn't give up Rezian,

770
00:33:56,487 --> 00:33:59,547
But he's sure as hell gonna
point a finger at you and me.

771
00:33:59,714 --> 00:34:00,914
Let him.

772
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:03,117
Claudette was in on it.

773
00:34:03,284 --> 00:34:04,484
She knew about the bust?

774
00:34:04,553 --> 00:34:06,864
I told her we were working with the feds

775
00:34:07,031 --> 00:34:08,599
On a tip you picked up from Rezian.

776
00:34:08,766 --> 00:34:11,718
It was the only way to pull it
off and keep us in the clear.

777
00:34:11,885 --> 00:34:14,271
Khalulian knows about
the money train, too.

778
00:34:14,438 --> 00:34:15,639
If he says anything, our story is

779
00:34:15,806 --> 00:34:19,056
That it was a lie you fed
to Rezian to keep him close.

780
00:34:19,416 --> 00:34:21,752
So, why did you keep me in the dark?

781
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:23,869
I don't trust you, remember?

782
00:34:24,657 --> 00:34:25,857
You know what?

783
00:34:25,974 --> 00:34:26,516
That's bullshit.

784
00:34:26,517 --> 00:34:28,874
I've done nothing but look out
for you, Corrine, and the kids,

785
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:31,237
And every single thing
that I have told you

786
00:34:31,404 --> 00:34:32,756
Has checked out so far.

787
00:34:32,923 --> 00:34:35,383
Hasn't stopped you from
using your secret file

788
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:37,166
To hang over our heads,
listing all the shit

789
00:34:37,333 --> 00:34:38,117
We've ever done.

790
00:34:38,118 --> 00:34:39,687
You know exactly why I did that.

791
00:34:39,854 --> 00:34:41,598
I'm the one standing by you, Vic.

792
00:34:41,765 --> 00:34:44,492
You're the one cutting
me out, punishing me.

793
00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:45,468
And you know what?

794
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:47,904
It's a stupid, dangerous
game that you're playing,

795
00:34:48,071 --> 00:34:50,464
Because I'm just trying
to help you protect

796
00:34:50,631 --> 00:34:53,281
The only thing that
really matters to you.

797
00:35:00,688 --> 00:35:02,084
Interrogation one, tony.

798
00:35:02,251 --> 00:35:03,142
Is that our rapist?

799
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:05,227
He's the guy who's renting the house -

800
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:07,244
Looks like our crime scene.

801
00:35:12,302 --> 00:35:13,418
Hey, um...

802
00:35:13,419 --> 00:35:15,036
I, uh, I heard some
of the unis complaining

803
00:35:15,203 --> 00:35:16,403
About the new administrative duties.

804
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:19,758
You ever think about someone
to assist you permanently?

805
00:35:19,925 --> 00:35:21,125
You have someone in mind?

806
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:22,270
Yeah. Danny.

807
00:35:22,271 --> 00:35:24,740
Danny's a sergeant. I wouldn't
waste her time at a desk.

808
00:35:24,907 --> 00:35:26,809
You ever think the reason
you run into problems

809
00:35:26,976 --> 00:35:30,426
Is the person on that desk is
underused or underqualified?

810
00:35:30,855 --> 00:35:31,879
What are you doing, Dutch?

811
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,815
Ever since lee was
born, she's changed -

812
00:35:33,982 --> 00:35:35,817
Some kind of maternal survival instinct.

813
00:35:35,984 --> 00:35:38,811
What she wants is something
out of the line of fire.

814
00:35:38,978 --> 00:35:39,787
She told you that?

815
00:35:39,788 --> 00:35:41,963
Too much pride, but if
you wanted to go that way,

816
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:44,280
I think you'd be helping her out.

817
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:48,096
She's already I.D.'D
you for the kidnapping.

818
00:35:48,263 --> 00:35:50,966
I'm sure the d. A. Can add
conspiracy to commit rape,

819
00:35:51,133 --> 00:35:53,683
Plus any additional charges involving...

820
00:35:55,628 --> 00:35:57,278
crimes against a minor.

821
00:35:59,081 --> 00:36:00,281
Any thoughts?

822
00:36:00,298 --> 00:36:02,848
Honestly, I wish they
were all this easy.

823
00:36:03,346 --> 00:36:04,311
I never touched her.

824
00:36:04,312 --> 00:36:07,162
She had sexual contact
with two other minors -

825
00:36:07,329 --> 00:36:08,573
Boys her own age.

826
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:09,807
It wasn't rape.

827
00:36:09,808 --> 00:36:10,617
It wasn't consensual.

828
00:36:10,618 --> 00:36:13,479
What she experienced was a
part of a therapeutic treatment.

829
00:36:14,012 --> 00:36:15,212
Treatment?

830
00:36:15,698 --> 00:36:16,814
For what?

831
00:36:16,815 --> 00:36:18,951
Wan's brother found out she was involved

832
00:36:19,118 --> 00:36:20,093
In a homosexual relationship.

833
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:22,944
Joe had assumed the role
as head of the family

834
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:24,121
After his father died.

835
00:36:24,122 --> 00:36:27,025
He didn't appreciate his
sister disgracing them.

836
00:36:27,192 --> 00:36:30,042
He wanted to spare his
mother from heartbreak.

837
00:36:30,705 --> 00:36:32,755
So, her brother hired you to...

838
00:36:34,166 --> 00:36:35,331
rape the lesbian out of her?

839
00:36:35,366 --> 00:36:37,578
To show her a preferable alternative.

840
00:36:37,745 --> 00:36:41,095
And this was supposed to get
her to wantmoresex with men?

841
00:36:41,848 --> 00:36:44,149
I offered positive encouragement
at a critical moment.

842
00:36:44,316 --> 00:36:45,516
As far as wan's case is concerned,

843
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:48,755
I'm hopeful it was successful.

844
00:36:48,922 --> 00:36:52,101
You have any proof that lee
hired you to "treat" his sister?

845
00:36:52,353 --> 00:36:54,260
I have a signed, legal document

846
00:36:54,427 --> 00:36:58,077
Giving me temporary custody over
wan while she was in my care,

847
00:37:01,807 --> 00:37:03,360
And a check for $3,000.

848
00:37:03,527 --> 00:37:04,493
How many stitches?

849
00:37:04,494 --> 00:37:04,994
19.

850
00:37:04,995 --> 00:37:05,604
Anything on harms?

851
00:37:05,605 --> 00:37:07,606
I got a "stake and notify" on his car.

852
00:37:07,773 --> 00:37:10,100
And I talked to a neighbor
- She told me that harms

853
00:37:10,267 --> 00:37:12,645
Always keeps his dog in
the back, not in the house.

854
00:37:12,812 --> 00:37:15,238
Axl
- He's the only one who knew we were going there.

855
00:37:15,405 --> 00:37:17,855
So I got him stewing in the clubhouse.

856
00:37:19,866 --> 00:37:21,066
You tipped off harms, dickwad.

857
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:25,130
Who's harms?

858
00:37:25,147 --> 00:37:26,508
He knew we were coming.

859
00:37:26,675 --> 00:37:28,260
He left his pit bull there to greet us.

860
00:37:28,427 --> 00:37:30,563
Now, the only question is,
what did you get out of it?

861
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:32,988
You must be more hooked
into harms than we thought.

862
00:37:33,155 --> 00:37:36,005
You're barking up the
wrong tree, fellas, okay?

863
00:37:36,897 --> 00:37:39,047
That's for the dea to decide now.

864
00:37:39,214 --> 00:37:41,025
Lowe: and the way those
guys like to drag their feet,

865
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:44,142
It will be 9, 10 months
before you get your store back.

866
00:37:44,309 --> 00:37:46,759
Look, I had no problem giving up larry.

867
00:37:47,902 --> 00:37:50,339
He's an asshole, but
I didn't want to burn

868
00:37:50,506 --> 00:37:52,756
A guy like harms 'cause that's like

869
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:54,955
A death sentence, all right?

870
00:37:57,478 --> 00:37:58,876
Where is he at now?

871
00:37:59,348 --> 00:38:00,023
Where is he at now?!

872
00:38:00,024 --> 00:38:03,174
We recovered over 900 guns
from the trucking factory,

873
00:38:03,341 --> 00:38:04,541
Thanks to your cooperation.

874
00:38:04,553 --> 00:38:07,120
Vendrell's snuggling up to
Rezian seems to be working.

875
00:38:07,287 --> 00:38:08,487
Southern charm's good for something.

876
00:38:09,343 --> 00:38:11,993
Thanks for not burning
our armenian target.

877
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,795
With Rezian still in
play, we can get deeper

878
00:38:13,962 --> 00:38:15,764
Into the organization
- Try to take

879
00:38:15,931 --> 00:38:16,740
The whole thing down.

880
00:38:16,741 --> 00:38:17,941
Well, khalulian's not talking.

881
00:38:17,964 --> 00:38:20,110
Hasn't mentioned any cops neither,

882
00:38:20,277 --> 00:38:22,637
So it looks like your
man's cover is still solid.

883
00:38:22,804 --> 00:38:25,354
Guess he's as loyal
as Rezian says he is.

884
00:38:40,087 --> 00:38:41,287
Where is she?

885
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:44,090
In her room.

886
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:51,580
Cassidy, come out here!

887
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:54,590
Cassidy, get out here!

888
00:38:54,635 --> 00:38:55,778
What were you thinking?

889
00:38:55,779 --> 00:38:59,015
You were supposed to be
watching your brother matthew.

890
00:38:59,182 --> 00:39:00,999
He could have gotten hurt or worse.

891
00:39:01,166 --> 00:39:02,366
He's 10 years old.

892
00:39:02,384 --> 00:39:03,018
He's autistic!

893
00:39:03,019 --> 00:39:04,587
Nothing happened, did it?

894
00:39:04,754 --> 00:39:07,506
Your brother was walking
around loose on the street.

895
00:39:07,673 --> 00:39:08,873
He's your responsibility, not mine.

896
00:39:09,141 --> 00:39:11,143
Hey! Who the hell do you
think you're talking to?!

897
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:13,909
The only parent that's
ever around to listen to me.

898
00:39:17,507 --> 00:39:18,523
Cassidy!

899
00:39:18,524 --> 00:39:19,158
Ow!

900
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:19,768
You're hurting me!

901
00:39:19,769 --> 00:39:22,994
Don't you ever push your mother
like that! Do you understand?!

902
00:39:23,161 --> 00:39:24,361
It was an accident.

903
00:39:24,429 --> 00:39:25,474
Vic, let her go!

904
00:39:25,475 --> 00:39:27,025
Do you understand me?!

905
00:39:31,688 --> 00:39:32,747
Let her go!

906
00:39:32,748 --> 00:39:35,098
We didn't raise her to be like that!

907
00:39:36,141 --> 00:39:37,242
You should go.

908
00:39:37,243 --> 00:39:38,443
I didn't mean to grab her that hard.

909
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,726
Let me deal with her, okay?

910
00:39:42,515 --> 00:39:44,165
No, I should apologize.

911
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:46,150
Go now!

912
00:39:50,923 --> 00:39:52,123
Now!

913
00:39:58,407 --> 00:39:59,735
You said we had to move,

914
00:39:59,902 --> 00:40:02,252
And you made me do it all by myself.

915
00:40:02,418 --> 00:40:03,618
Where were you?

916
00:40:03,731 --> 00:40:04,073
I was out.

917
00:40:04,074 --> 00:40:05,541
Oh, yeah, you were out. Stupid me.

918
00:40:06,542 --> 00:40:08,492
No, you talking to Corrine -

919
00:40:08,712 --> 00:40:11,014
You talking to Corrine
- That was stupid you.

920
00:40:12,181 --> 00:40:14,800
I thought somebody had to do
something for jackson and me

921
00:40:14,835 --> 00:40:16,917
Because when it comes to
Vic, you don't do shit.

922
00:40:19,978 --> 00:40:21,214
Where's the file?

923
00:40:21,381 --> 00:40:23,792
The list of shit that
Vic and I did, mara.

924
00:40:23,827 --> 00:40:25,027
What did you do with it?!

925
00:40:34,295 --> 00:40:35,495
Here.

926
00:40:36,264 --> 00:40:37,514
What did you do?

927
00:40:40,132 --> 00:40:41,455
God damn it, mara.

928
00:40:41,886 --> 00:40:43,045
Shane... Shane!

929
00:40:43,046 --> 00:40:44,500
Where are you going with that?

930
00:40:44,752 --> 00:40:46,502
I'm gonna give it to Vic.

931
00:40:46,822 --> 00:40:48,872
I've already made another copy.

932
00:40:50,674 --> 00:40:51,477
I'm sorry.

933
00:40:51,478 --> 00:40:52,187
I should've told you.

934
00:40:52,188 --> 00:40:54,824
You're always chasing Vic's
tail as if he's most important.

935
00:40:54,991 --> 00:40:57,388
I have to get Vic's
family in the clear again.

936
00:40:57,727 --> 00:41:00,677
Once this threat is gone,
we are out of his life.

937
00:41:01,931 --> 00:41:03,481
What about our family?

938
00:41:03,655 --> 00:41:04,632
What about me?

939
00:41:04,633 --> 00:41:07,743
Mara, you and jackson and the baby
- You always come first.

940
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:09,110
You know that.

941
00:41:09,637 --> 00:41:12,104
We just have to be patient
a little while longer.

942
00:41:12,271 --> 00:41:14,321
I owe him this one last thing.

943
00:41:17,509 --> 00:41:20,959
Sofer: I used to be worried
about lee not having a sibling.

944
00:41:20,994 --> 00:41:21,028
I'm not so worried anymore.

945
00:41:21,029 --> 00:41:21,449
Yeah, um, hey...

946
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:25,000
would you ever consider taking
claudette's desk full time -

947
00:41:25,344 --> 00:41:27,194
Helping her run this place?

948
00:41:28,146 --> 00:41:28,512
Why?

949
00:41:28,513 --> 00:41:30,663
She's been a little, uh, erratic.

950
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:31,716
You've noticed.

951
00:41:31,717 --> 00:41:32,317
Is she all right?

952
00:41:32,318 --> 00:41:35,468
I can't get specific, but
she can later if she wants.

953
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:37,098
No, she's not all right.

954
00:41:37,265 --> 00:41:39,430
If she doesn't get somebody
real good backstopping her,

955
00:41:39,773 --> 00:41:41,852
This place could really suffer.

956
00:41:43,971 --> 00:41:45,821
Just think about it, okay?

957
00:41:50,362 --> 00:41:53,512
Mr. Lee's lawyer got a court
order for wan's release.

958
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:55,829
He's got good timing
- Mr. Lee?

959
00:41:56,757 --> 00:41:57,215
You're under arrest.

960
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:57,674
What's the charge?

961
00:41:57,675 --> 00:42:00,225
Kidnapping and
conspiracy to commit rape.

962
00:42:01,539 --> 00:42:03,089
Come on, we're going.

963
00:42:03,256 --> 00:42:06,082
Peter meyers is under
arrest, too. He's upstairs.

964
00:42:06,249 --> 00:42:08,084
He's got some interesting theories

965
00:42:08,251 --> 00:42:09,876
On treating aberrant sexual behavior.

966
00:42:10,305 --> 00:42:11,505
Stick around.

967
00:42:11,622 --> 00:42:12,822
We'll talk about them.

968
00:42:12,932 --> 00:42:14,482
I'll get him printed.

969
00:42:14,517 --> 00:42:15,712
Let's go.

970
00:42:15,713 --> 00:42:16,913
Joe?

971
00:42:21,514 --> 00:42:21,847
Wan!

972
00:42:21,848 --> 00:42:23,056
What are you doing here?

973
00:42:23,308 --> 00:42:25,058
I've been worried about you.

974
00:42:25,285 --> 00:42:25,751
Go away!

975
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:28,102
But I'm the one
- Get away from me!

976
00:42:28,922 --> 00:42:30,272
Stay away from me!

977
00:42:42,993 --> 00:42:44,243
Bite looks bad.

978
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:45,695
How's the bark?

979
00:42:45,821 --> 00:42:47,298
Almost got my balls chewed off

980
00:42:47,465 --> 00:42:50,515
Because we went in there
too quick and undermanned.

981
00:42:50,702 --> 00:42:52,252
Look, man, I'm sorry.

982
00:42:52,445 --> 00:42:53,645
I had no choice.

983
00:42:53,705 --> 00:42:55,506
We all had choices once and we made 'em,

984
00:42:55,673 --> 00:42:56,873
And now we got to live with them.

985
00:42:57,091 --> 00:42:59,941
Ronnie, we're gonna get
out of this quicksand.

986
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:03,154
No, we're not.

987
00:43:03,271 --> 00:43:04,447
Jesus, Vic, everything we do

988
00:43:04,448 --> 00:43:06,599
To get out of this shit
just drags us down deeper,

989
00:43:06,817 --> 00:43:09,410
And hanging with Shane is
gonna push our heads under.

990
00:43:09,577 --> 00:43:10,636
We need Shane right now.

991
00:43:10,637 --> 00:43:12,950
I'm sick of walking around half the day

992
00:43:13,117 --> 00:43:16,067
Smiling at a guy who put
a grenade in Lem's lap.

993
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:18,295
Hey, you know what's
at stake here for me.

994
00:43:18,462 --> 00:43:21,322
I do, yeah, but I'm not
gonna drown for Shane...

995
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:27,069
or you.

996
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:29,720
Hey, Rezian just gave
me his list of names.

997
00:43:30,364 --> 00:43:33,214
Aside from khalulian,
who got swept up tonight,

998
00:43:33,949 --> 00:43:35,345
There's only five guys.

999
00:43:35,512 --> 00:43:37,713
Think that's everyone who knows
about us and the money train?

1000
00:43:37,965 --> 00:43:40,132
Aside from diro, who's
in the wind or dead, yeah.

1001
00:43:40,518 --> 00:43:42,468
Then what are we waiting for?

1002
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,488
Protecting my family was
only one part of this war.

1003
00:43:45,655 --> 00:43:48,724
Tearing pezuela down is the
other, and I'm not there yet.

1004
00:43:55,673 --> 00:43:56,632
That's it.

1005
00:43:56,633 --> 00:43:57,983
That's everything.

1006
00:43:58,619 --> 00:44:00,069
There are no copies.

1007
00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:05,030
Take it.

1008
00:44:05,197 --> 00:44:06,397
It's all I can do.

1009
00:44:06,509 --> 00:44:08,536
Now I've got nothing
on paper on you guys.

1010
00:44:08,711 --> 00:44:12,061
I talked to mara. The thing
that happened with Corrine -

1011
00:44:12,805 --> 00:44:14,555
It'll never happen again.

1012
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:19,488
You want blood from me?

1013
00:44:19,655 --> 00:44:22,905
Just break out the goddamn
needle, man, I will give it.

1014
00:44:26,986 --> 00:44:28,736
Well, I got to get back.

1015
00:44:30,723 --> 00:44:31,523
Wait.

1016
00:44:31,524 --> 00:44:33,974
Look, we all heard the lies about Lem.

1017
00:44:34,927 --> 00:44:37,577
We knew he was under
pressure and scared -

1018
00:44:38,346 --> 00:44:39,874
Thought he might have turned.

1019
00:44:40,041 --> 00:44:43,591
None of us will really know
exactly what he would have done,

1020
00:44:44,105 --> 00:44:46,855
But you were the only
one of us who saw him.

1021
00:44:49,676 --> 00:44:51,026
Now, I hate it...

1022
00:44:51,344 --> 00:44:52,694
and it hurts me...

1023
00:44:54,463 --> 00:44:57,713
but under the circumstances,
you made the only decision

1024
00:44:58,413 --> 00:45:02,413
You could at the time. I know that now.

1025
00:45:06,776 --> 00:45:07,976
Thank you.

1026
00:45:09,236 --> 00:45:10,681
Yeah, we're gonna all get through this

1027
00:45:11,095 --> 00:45:13,645
And come through the other side one day.

1028
00:45:20,705 --> 00:45:21,905
Yeah...
