1
00:00:00,709 --> 00:00:02,647
Previously on "the shield"...

2
00:00:02,682 --> 00:00:03,878
We're targeting
cruz pezuela.

3
00:00:03,913 --> 00:00:05,773
Aceveda's one-Man
campaign bankroll?

4
00:00:05,808 --> 00:00:08,117
He's buying up farmington
with cartel money.

5
00:00:08,152 --> 00:00:10,197
Blackmail -- That's how
pezuela's getting everyone

6
00:00:10,198 --> 00:00:11,757
On board the train
to cartel town.

7
00:00:11,792 --> 00:00:13,021
Pezuela's got it in his head

8
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:15,140
That the armenians
have the blackmail box.

9
00:00:15,175 --> 00:00:17,021
We need a quick armenian
political win.

10
00:00:17,056 --> 00:00:18,598
City controller --
Robert martin.

11
00:00:18,633 --> 00:00:20,558
He's in the blackmail box?

12
00:00:20,593 --> 00:00:21,320
Robert! Oh, my god!

13
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:23,568
That was a goddamn
assassination!

14
00:00:23,603 --> 00:00:26,442
I want pezuela in prison
and out of my life now.

15
00:00:26,477 --> 00:00:28,437
Agent murray's looking
to take down the cartel.

16
00:00:28,472 --> 00:00:29,660
She's in the blackmail box?

17
00:00:29,695 --> 00:00:31,467
I'm turning over the box
to justice.

18
00:00:31,502 --> 00:00:32,288
What about olivia?

19
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:35,488
If she's got to get dragged down
to bust pezuela, so be it.

20
00:00:35,523 --> 00:00:36,769
Shane?

21
00:00:36,804 --> 00:00:38,776
You dropped a grenade
in his lap, and what

22
00:00:38,811 --> 00:00:40,008
Did you do? Did you run?

23
00:00:40,043 --> 00:00:43,283
I got a plan that will give lem
the justice he deserves.

24
00:00:43,318 --> 00:00:44,305
This is taking too long.

25
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,305
Take a look around.

26
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,649
I'm gonna pull shane
out of there, man.

27
00:00:46,684 --> 00:00:49,079
-It's not too late.
-We still have a choice.

28
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:51,919
Do you think that shane
gave lem a choice?

29
00:00:51,954 --> 00:00:53,047
I'm not shane.

30
00:00:54,599 --> 00:00:55,695
Where the hell
did you get those mexicans?

31
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,110
Man, i almost got my dick
shot off.

32
00:00:57,145 --> 00:00:58,079
I tried to call you.

33
00:00:58,114 --> 00:00:59,703
Yeah, rezian
took my cellphone.

34
00:00:59,738 --> 00:01:00,775
Where you been?

35
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,367
Vic and ronnie
tried to kill me tonight.

36
00:01:02,402 --> 00:01:04,049
You know,
the worst part is,

37
00:01:04,084 --> 00:01:07,486
Is they think i'm too stupid
to even realize it.

38
00:01:16,004 --> 00:01:17,680
This may take a few days.

39
00:01:17,715 --> 00:01:19,736
What about today?

40
00:01:19,771 --> 00:01:21,675
Today i watch my back.

41
00:01:22,934 --> 00:01:25,192
Vic didn't get another crack
at me.

42
00:01:26,224 --> 00:01:27,664
Just be careful, okay?

43
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:30,991
Always. Come here.

44
00:01:31,086 --> 00:01:32,471
I love you.

45
00:01:33,382 --> 00:01:34,607
So much.

46
00:01:40,197 --> 00:01:41,495
We'll always be together.

47
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,054
All of us.

48
00:01:43,598 --> 00:01:44,512
Bye-Bye, buddy.

49
00:01:44,547 --> 00:01:46,125
I love you.

50
00:01:47,788 --> 00:01:48,791
Talk to you later.

51
00:01:48,826 --> 00:01:50,199
Okay.

52
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,406
Bye.

53
00:02:02,261 --> 00:02:02,869
Vic.

54
00:02:02,904 --> 00:02:04,556
I wanted to talk to you
outside of the job.

55
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:07,349
I didn't feel good about the
tone of our last conversation,

56
00:02:07,384 --> 00:02:09,765
Especially on my end.

57
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,835
I appreciate the apology,

58
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:13,643
But if you're interested
in doing the right thing,

59
00:02:13,678 --> 00:02:15,130
You'll relinquish your rights
to lee.

60
00:02:15,165 --> 00:02:16,866
Can i come in
so we can talk this over?

61
00:02:16,901 --> 00:02:18,745
No, he's about to wake up.

62
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,349
-I've got to feed him.
-I'll make it quick.

63
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:24,889
This is for him.

64
00:02:24,924 --> 00:02:27,172
It's one of those things
you hang over the crib.

65
00:02:27,736 --> 00:02:29,892
It's supposed to be good
for the hand-Eye thing.

66
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:34,378
Thanks.

67
00:02:34,413 --> 00:02:37,489
Look, danny, i don't want us
to be at odds over our boy.

68
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:40,260
Then sign
the quitclaim form.

69
00:02:42,643 --> 00:02:46,085
Well, you hit me up
with your paperwork,

70
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,165
And i'm just here
to give you a heads-Up

71
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,413
I'm about to hit you up
with mine.

72
00:02:50,448 --> 00:02:52,172
Court-Ordered dna test.

73
00:02:52,207 --> 00:02:54,300
I'm pursuing
my legal remedies.

74
00:02:54,335 --> 00:02:54,934
Jesus christ.

75
00:02:54,969 --> 00:02:56,934
You want to have a kid so bad?

76
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:58,448
I know a lot of women
who'd like to get knocked up.

77
00:02:58,483 --> 00:03:00,029
I've got things to do.

78
00:03:00,676 --> 00:03:02,012
We can slug it out in court,

79
00:03:02,047 --> 00:03:04,288
Spend a lot of time and money
we don't have,

80
00:03:04,323 --> 00:03:06,471
Or we can work together
on a plan.

81
00:03:06,506 --> 00:03:09,295
Vic, don't you dare
turn this into something ugly.

82
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,049
I'm just trying to figure out
a way

83
00:03:11,084 --> 00:03:12,207
That we can make an arrangement

84
00:03:12,242 --> 00:03:15,487
That we could both live with
that acknowledges my rights

85
00:03:15,522 --> 00:03:18,590
And my responsibilities
as the father.

86
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:20,085
That's it.

87
00:03:21,245 --> 00:03:22,324
All right.

88
00:03:23,165 --> 00:03:25,885
Look, i can pull the court order
at any time between now

89
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,352
And the end of business
tomorrow.

90
00:03:29,851 --> 00:03:32,180
You let me know
how you want to handle it.

91
00:03:36,443 --> 00:03:39,446
Director chaffee, when these
files turned up in my office,

92
00:03:39,481 --> 00:03:42,341
I realized that cruz pezuela
was using them

93
00:03:42,376 --> 00:03:44,796
To blackmail
prominent citizens.

94
00:03:44,831 --> 00:03:47,779
Any idea why this anonymously
landed on your doorstep?

95
00:03:47,814 --> 00:03:49,043
I wouldn't want to speculate.

96
00:03:49,078 --> 00:03:52,163
Well, my guess is whoever
was sitting on this got nervous

97
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:53,378
After the martin killing,

98
00:03:53,413 --> 00:03:54,842
Realized his file was in there,

99
00:03:54,877 --> 00:03:56,697
Which could implicate him
in a murder,

100
00:03:56,732 --> 00:03:58,650
Wanted to dump
the hot potato.

101
00:03:58,685 --> 00:04:01,541
Mr. Pezuela is one of the biggest
contributors to my campaign,

102
00:04:01,576 --> 00:04:03,732
But that doesn't
buy him any rhythm.

103
00:04:03,767 --> 00:04:05,929
If anything, it obliges me
to bend over backwards

104
00:04:05,964 --> 00:04:07,785
To see that he is brought
to justice.

105
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,025
Rhd has been running
the martin case.

106
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:13,698
As lead detective, i'd be open to some sort
of joint investigation here.

107
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:15,650
Take a look at this.

108
00:04:18,537 --> 00:04:22,224
Armando rios, veteran lieutenant
in the mexican drug cartel.

109
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:25,304
We believe the cartel
is using pezuela as a front

110
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:27,423
For their california operation.

111
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,191
What are we looking at here,
detective?

112
00:04:29,226 --> 00:04:30,566
I met with rios.

113
00:04:30,601 --> 00:04:33,206
I tried to develop him
as an intel asset.

114
00:04:33,241 --> 00:04:36,116
I was trying to prove your hunch --
Connecting him to pezuela.

115
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:38,676
When i realized
that martin's file was in there,

116
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:40,979
My first impulse was to go
to detective mackey,

117
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:44,393
Figuring it could be
evidence in a homicide.

118
00:04:44,428 --> 00:04:45,493
So, in point of fact,

119
00:04:45,528 --> 00:04:50,020
You didn't come to i.C.E. First
with these files.

120
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,661
Vic and i thought it could
be managed at a local level.

121
00:04:53,696 --> 00:04:55,486
But after
the armenian bloodbath,

122
00:04:55,521 --> 00:04:59,542
We both realized that this was
more than farmington division

123
00:04:59,577 --> 00:05:02,198
-Was equipped to handle.
-Right.

124
00:05:02,233 --> 00:05:04,632
You knew this was
an rhd investigation.

125
00:05:04,667 --> 00:05:06,335
You were instructed
to stand down.

126
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,295
I was already hip deep.

127
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:08,776
I wanted to put
the pieces together

128
00:05:08,811 --> 00:05:10,563
And bring you a package
with a bow on it.

129
00:05:10,598 --> 00:05:11,755
Well, it's pretty clear
detective mackey

130
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,635
Disobeyed a direct order
by meddling,

131
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,064
Which we'll deal with
on our end.

132
00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:17,893
That said, if you'd like to embed a
couple of your agents with my team --

133
00:05:17,928 --> 00:05:19,269
This agency will take it
from here.

134
00:05:19,304 --> 00:05:20,995
Sir -- Sir, my people
are down the line.

135
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:23,661
-They're ready to go.
-This in an i.C.E. Investigation now.

136
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,008
Hey, you just cost me
a high-Profile case,

137
00:05:28,043 --> 00:05:28,738
You little prick.

138
00:05:28,773 --> 00:05:31,484
I'll try to live
with the disappointment.

139
00:05:33,184 --> 00:05:34,311
Thank you.

140
00:05:37,276 --> 00:05:39,998
Well, vic, it looks like
pezuela's blackmail box

141
00:05:40,033 --> 00:05:41,960
Is finally
someone else's headache.

142
00:05:41,995 --> 00:05:44,359
I thought you wanted to take
down that menudo shitter

143
00:05:44,394 --> 00:05:46,383
So you could get credit
for cleaning up farmington.

144
00:05:46,418 --> 00:05:48,658
Oh, i intend to.

145
00:05:48,693 --> 00:05:50,793
Plus, kissing i.C.E. Into this
should win me some friends

146
00:05:50,828 --> 00:05:51,850
At a federal level.

147
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:54,091
Pezuela's gonna grind up
half of l.A.

148
00:05:54,126 --> 00:05:56,786
Before these dipshits come up
with a code name

149
00:05:56,821 --> 00:05:58,340
For their operation.

150
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,805
But i guess as long as thetimes
gets a photo of you

151
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,517
In an i.C.E. Windbreaker,
that's all that really matters, right?

152
00:06:03,552 --> 00:06:05,107
You know, i just handed you
an alibi in there

153
00:06:05,142 --> 00:06:06,708
While you were
on surveillance

154
00:06:06,743 --> 00:06:09,263
Jawboning with one
of pezuela's thugs.

155
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:11,473
What about olivia?

156
00:06:11,508 --> 00:06:13,593
Her file's in there.

157
00:06:14,093 --> 00:06:15,647
By giving it back,
you might as well have

158
00:06:15,682 --> 00:06:17,666
Pushed her in front
of a freight train.

159
00:06:18,853 --> 00:06:22,239
Yeah, well,
i took out olivia's file.

160
00:06:22,274 --> 00:06:24,267
You gave it back to her?

161
00:06:24,565 --> 00:06:25,508
No.

162
00:06:25,732 --> 00:06:28,404
But i got it out
of a bad situation.

163
00:06:29,948 --> 00:06:33,075
Bet she can't wait
until that bill comes due.

164
00:06:35,803 --> 00:06:36,705
How'd it go?

165
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,190
Another mexican donkey show,

166
00:06:39,225 --> 00:06:41,901
And aceveda had me playing
the reluctant virgin.

167
00:06:42,403 --> 00:06:45,192
-Seen shane this morning?
-Not yet.

168
00:06:45,227 --> 00:06:47,768
We're gonna talk about finishing
what we started?

169
00:06:47,803 --> 00:06:49,448
Bad enough
i called an audible

170
00:06:49,483 --> 00:06:50,594
Trying to pull shane
out of there,

171
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:51,924
And you didn't back my play.

172
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:53,706
Because you were right
the first time.

173
00:06:53,741 --> 00:06:56,620
Yeah, and now we have no idea
what shane knows,

174
00:06:56,655 --> 00:06:58,180
What he suspects,
or what he'll do.

175
00:06:58,215 --> 00:07:00,699
On a good day,
this prick's a wild card.

176
00:07:00,734 --> 00:07:04,635
I've known shane from way back
before the strike team.

177
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:06,713
He wasn't always like this.

178
00:07:06,748 --> 00:07:07,753
So?

179
00:07:07,788 --> 00:07:10,553
I played a big part
in where he is right now.

180
00:07:10,588 --> 00:07:11,508
I got to own that.

181
00:07:11,543 --> 00:07:14,561
That's why you got to
put him down.

182
00:07:15,532 --> 00:07:18,732
I got a daughter traipsing
around in a french maid's outfit

183
00:07:18,767 --> 00:07:20,212
In front of boys
popping "x."

184
00:07:20,247 --> 00:07:23,244
Is that the way you'd advise me
to deal with her, too, huh?

185
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:24,379
I'm gonna work with her,

186
00:07:24,414 --> 00:07:26,823
Try to get her
going straight again.

187
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:29,321
And maybe that's what
i have to do to shane.

188
00:07:29,356 --> 00:07:30,241
I'll fix him, too.

189
00:07:30,276 --> 00:07:32,488
I wish that you could hear
your goddamn rationalizations.

190
00:07:32,523 --> 00:07:35,447
Vic, you need to be downtown
in an hour

191
00:07:35,482 --> 00:07:37,395
For your review board hearing.

192
00:07:37,895 --> 00:07:40,182
That's not -- That's not
for another two weeks.

193
00:07:40,217 --> 00:07:41,877
Schedule's moved.
You're up.

194
00:07:41,912 --> 00:07:43,768
Pba rep will meet you there.

195
00:07:54,486 --> 00:07:56,794
Termination without pension,

196
00:07:56,829 --> 00:07:59,529
Effective 10 days from now.

197
00:07:59,564 --> 00:08:00,728
Jesus.

198
00:08:00,763 --> 00:08:02,047
What happened?

199
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:03,863
I didn't have pezuela's box
to hand them

200
00:08:03,898 --> 00:08:06,279
To offset my shaky jacket.

201
00:08:06,314 --> 00:08:09,701
That bastard, kouf, he's the one
who sealed the deal.

202
00:08:09,736 --> 00:08:12,493
Said i cost him
the martin investigation.

203
00:08:12,528 --> 00:08:14,451
Didn't follow orders.

204
00:08:14,486 --> 00:08:18,267
Taking down the public face
of the mexican cartel got you canned?

205
00:08:18,302 --> 00:08:21,979
Apparently, the brass thinks
this asshole shits spumoni.

206
00:08:23,866 --> 00:08:25,106
You're gonna fight this,
right?

207
00:08:25,141 --> 00:08:27,132
-Detective mackey,
-Jesus, vic.

208
00:08:27,167 --> 00:08:28,380
We're not done.

209
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,743
In spite of this ruling,

210
00:08:29,778 --> 00:08:31,483
The final determination's
up to the chief.

211
00:08:31,518 --> 00:08:34,529
Go to your captain, get her
to put in a good word.

212
00:08:34,564 --> 00:08:35,729
I see
you're a married man.

213
00:08:35,764 --> 00:08:38,401
Is your wife pretty?

214
00:08:38,436 --> 00:08:39,243
Beautiful.

215
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:41,761
You mind if i take her to vegas
for a dirty weekend,

216
00:08:41,796 --> 00:08:45,840
Ride her ass hard
and put her away wet?

217
00:08:46,177 --> 00:08:46,867
What?

218
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:49,529
Now, that's about the level
of cooperation i can expect

219
00:08:49,564 --> 00:08:53,705
From my captain on anything.

220
00:08:54,108 --> 00:08:59,007
<Font color="#ffff00">sync:vine</font>

221
00:08:59,042 --> 00:09:02,519
<Font color="#ffff00">s7e07</font>

222
00:09:09,502 --> 00:09:12,590
Hey, what's this buzz i'm hearing
about them taking your badge?

223
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,524
Done deal. 10 days.

224
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:16,007
Holy christ, man.

225
00:09:16,042 --> 00:09:16,862
What are you gonna do?

226
00:09:16,897 --> 00:09:19,931
You doing okay
after that close call?

227
00:09:21,439 --> 00:09:24,357
Yeah, it was a long, dark night
to think about what almost happened.

228
00:09:24,392 --> 00:09:27,222
Just makes you want to
hug your kid and not let go.

229
00:09:27,257 --> 00:09:28,653
You're telling me.

230
00:09:28,688 --> 00:09:30,094
Yeah, thank god i'm
blessed with a wife

231
00:09:30,129 --> 00:09:32,707
-Who loves me to death.
-That's right.

232
00:09:32,742 --> 00:09:35,667
So, you want to track down
those mexis

233
00:09:35,702 --> 00:09:36,977
That put me in the middle
of that shooting gallery?

234
00:09:37,012 --> 00:09:37,889
Damn straight.

235
00:09:37,924 --> 00:09:40,665
Let's find out what bullshit
we're facing here first.

236
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,449
What are we looking at?

237
00:09:41,484 --> 00:09:43,833
Ag assault, working girl,
sketchy vitals.

238
00:09:43,868 --> 00:09:45,312
Why'd you dime us?

239
00:09:45,347 --> 00:09:47,669
Strike team has no stake
in a half-Dead blow girl.

240
00:09:47,704 --> 00:09:50,117
A co-Worker found her,
said she knows you.

241
00:09:50,152 --> 00:09:52,604
What is it
with you and whores?

242
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,545
I was trying to keep them
from tempting you.

243
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,633
We might as well start
getting the cameras going.

244
00:09:56,668 --> 00:09:57,989
Don't work up a sweat.
I'll be quick.

245
00:09:58,024 --> 00:09:59,851
Where's the chickenhead?

246
00:09:59,886 --> 00:10:01,754
This pretty lady
waiting right there.

247
00:10:03,734 --> 00:10:05,543
Hey, baby.

248
00:10:05,578 --> 00:10:07,231
You're upset.

249
00:10:08,381 --> 00:10:09,533
Vic.

250
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,319
It's me. Farrah.

251
00:10:15,878 --> 00:10:17,655
Holy jesus christ.

252
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:19,317
You've got to get the guy
who did this.

253
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:20,757
It was bombay, our pimp.

254
00:10:20,792 --> 00:10:23,893
A hooker scoring a beat down
is below my pay grade.

255
00:10:23,928 --> 00:10:25,855
A friend of yours
is even lower.

256
00:10:25,993 --> 00:10:28,060
Am and i were getting clean
for each other.

257
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:30,950
That's why bombay did this.

258
00:10:30,985 --> 00:10:32,359
He'll be coming for me next.

259
00:10:32,394 --> 00:10:33,648
You had your chance.

260
00:10:33,683 --> 00:10:35,385
I gave you a bus ticket
out of the life.

261
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,529
Instead of doing the smart
thing, you played me.

262
00:10:37,564 --> 00:10:40,993
-Why are you mad at me, vic?
-I don't give a rat's ass about you, lady!

263
00:10:41,028 --> 00:10:43,399
Did bad shit
go down between us?

264
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:44,664
I don't -- I don't rember.

265
00:10:44,699 --> 00:10:47,839
You don't remember whose cock you
gagged on this morning, either.

266
00:10:47,874 --> 00:10:49,383
I'm not like that anymore.

267
00:10:49,418 --> 00:10:51,311
Amber and me had two weeks
without using.

268
00:10:51,346 --> 00:10:52,723
We're going to meetings
and everything.

269
00:10:52,758 --> 00:10:55,499
Hey, vic, the emts
just pronounced her.

270
00:10:55,534 --> 00:10:57,555
She -- She's dead?

271
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,723
Oh, my god. Oh, my --

272
00:10:59,758 --> 00:11:01,898
You've got to catch
the guy who did this.

273
00:11:01,933 --> 00:11:04,674
Please, vic. Please, vic.

274
00:11:09,119 --> 00:11:11,791
Get this skank on record
and get her out of here.

275
00:11:11,826 --> 00:11:13,463
I thought you were gonna
help me.

276
00:11:13,498 --> 00:11:15,384
I accidently touched you,

277
00:11:15,419 --> 00:11:17,040
And i haven't had a tetanus shot
in a while.

278
00:11:17,075 --> 00:11:19,801
My girl gets murdered
and you don't give a shit?

279
00:11:19,836 --> 00:11:22,748
-Don't care i'm next?
-By me, that's euthanasia.

280
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:23,918
Vic.

281
00:11:23,953 --> 00:11:26,270
I've already been down the road
with this slut.

282
00:11:26,305 --> 00:11:28,014
Her mouth is only good
for two things,

283
00:11:28,049 --> 00:11:30,726
And one of them's
lying through her teeth.

284
00:11:30,761 --> 00:11:32,538
I need help, vic!

285
00:11:36,109 --> 00:11:37,180
Have a seat.

286
00:11:38,229 --> 00:11:40,371
When was the last time
you saw amber?

287
00:11:40,406 --> 00:11:41,827
Yesterday.

288
00:11:42,444 --> 00:11:44,026
She works nights.

289
00:11:44,061 --> 00:11:45,074
The manager
at the liquor spot

290
00:11:45,109 --> 00:11:47,898
Lets her clean up in the back sink
on the way home from the stroll.

291
00:11:47,933 --> 00:11:51,244
Usually gets to the car about
the time the sun comes up.

292
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,844
When she didn't show,
i knew something was bad.

293
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,026
You told vic
you know who did it.

294
00:11:56,061 --> 00:11:57,379
Damn straight.

295
00:11:57,414 --> 00:11:58,636
Our pimp, bombay.

296
00:11:58,671 --> 00:11:59,809
How do you know it was him?

297
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:02,185
'Cause he said he was gonna.

298
00:12:02,672 --> 00:12:04,196
Bombay turns you out,

299
00:12:04,231 --> 00:12:06,401
Puts you on the track,

300
00:12:06,436 --> 00:12:07,505
You don't leave.

301
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,913
Where's bombay
get his drugs?

302
00:12:08,948 --> 00:12:10,576
Manufactures them.

303
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,592
Crystal's the main gig.

304
00:12:12,627 --> 00:12:14,255
Running bitches is just a hobby.

305
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:17,984
Said it's like
owning race horses.

306
00:12:23,127 --> 00:12:24,735
I trusted you.

307
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:27,310
Now i find you had pezuela's box
the whole time.

308
00:12:27,345 --> 00:12:29,687
Yeah, i had the box,

309
00:12:29,722 --> 00:12:31,007
And you were in it.

310
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:33,119
I had to make sure
i could trust you.

311
00:12:33,154 --> 00:12:34,793
And i lost the box
to aceveda,

312
00:12:34,828 --> 00:12:37,561
And he flipped it over to your
boss against my objections.

313
00:12:37,596 --> 00:12:39,330
Know a good trial attorney?

314
00:12:39,365 --> 00:12:42,533
Aceveda pulled your file
before he turned it over.

315
00:12:42,568 --> 00:12:43,389
Why?

316
00:12:43,424 --> 00:12:44,573
One side of his mouth,

317
00:12:44,608 --> 00:12:45,613
He would call it a good deed.

318
00:12:45,648 --> 00:12:48,074
The other would call it
leverage over you

319
00:12:48,109 --> 00:12:50,323
For favors
to be named later.

320
00:12:50,358 --> 00:12:52,918
So i've traded one blackmailer
for another?

321
00:12:52,953 --> 00:12:54,654
You're been granted
a reprieve.

322
00:12:54,689 --> 00:12:56,493
That's all that matters
right now.

323
00:12:56,952 --> 00:12:59,322
My here and now is how
to bring down pezuela

324
00:12:59,357 --> 00:13:00,842
In the 10 days
i still have a badge

325
00:13:00,877 --> 00:13:01,977
Because there's no way in hell

326
00:13:02,012 --> 00:13:04,827
The geniuses in your agency
are up for the job.

327
00:13:04,862 --> 00:13:07,345
Chaffee's making this case
a priority.

328
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,977
Whatever that means.

329
00:13:09,618 --> 00:13:11,366
Rios has disappeared.

330
00:13:11,401 --> 00:13:12,889
Pezuela's insulated.

331
00:13:12,924 --> 00:13:14,272
He knows there's heat.

332
00:13:15,032 --> 00:13:16,919
You need someone
on the inside,

333
00:13:16,954 --> 00:13:18,904
And that only means me.

334
00:13:18,939 --> 00:13:20,271
Chaffee will never
go for it.

335
00:13:20,306 --> 00:13:21,432
Far as he's concerned,

336
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,455
Local cops are either
incompetent or dirty.

337
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:25,774
Really?
What's his plan, then?

338
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:30,245
He's gonna raid pezuela's
construction site today.

339
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,398
Looking for what?

340
00:13:31,433 --> 00:13:34,058
Surveillance has rios going into
that job site two days ago.

341
00:13:34,093 --> 00:13:35,817
He was never witnessed
coming out.

342
00:13:35,852 --> 00:13:37,224
We find a body,

343
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:39,703
Chaffee goes after pezuela
on conspiracy homicide.

344
00:13:39,738 --> 00:13:40,959
You're not gonna find a body.

345
00:13:40,994 --> 00:13:41,626
Trust me.

346
00:13:41,661 --> 00:13:43,329
And the only thing
this raid is gonna do

347
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,515
Is send pezuela scurrying
for his bunker.

348
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,514
You have to stop it.

349
00:13:47,549 --> 00:13:49,105
I could tip pezuela off,

350
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:52,049
Keep alive the fiction
he's still got a hook in me.

351
00:13:59,402 --> 00:14:02,477
I got a way
we can both curry some favor.

352
00:14:04,017 --> 00:14:04,867
By the end of business,

353
00:14:04,902 --> 00:14:07,486
The feds are gonna be crawling
all over this place.

354
00:14:07,521 --> 00:14:08,965
Where did you get
the information?

355
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,638
I got a real deep throat
in d.C.,

356
00:14:11,673 --> 00:14:16,207
Tipped me the local office is
waiting on approval to move forward.

357
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,731
A local cop
with federal reach.

358
00:14:18,766 --> 00:14:21,098
Well, when you're a grower
not a shower,

359
00:14:21,133 --> 00:14:24,449
It helps to have a deep throat
with no gag reflex.

360
00:14:25,223 --> 00:14:28,935
And if your information
should have some merit?

361
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:32,688
Then we should start talking
about a promotion and a raise.

362
00:14:32,723 --> 00:14:34,690
I had another thought.

363
00:14:38,449 --> 00:14:40,355
This week's pay
and severance.

364
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,317
You haven't found
my missing box,

365
00:14:42,352 --> 00:14:43,737
And in 10 days,

366
00:14:43,772 --> 00:14:45,520
You won't have a badge.

367
00:14:45,555 --> 00:14:46,436
You're no use to me.

368
00:14:46,471 --> 00:14:49,283
Hey, i handed you
the armenians on a platter,

369
00:14:49,318 --> 00:14:51,221
And i'm telling you the feds
are about to show up here,

370
00:14:51,256 --> 00:14:52,332
Pry your mouth open,

371
00:14:52,367 --> 00:14:54,174
And take a big, long piss.

372
00:14:54,209 --> 00:14:56,458
What have you done
for me lately?

373
00:14:56,493 --> 00:14:58,944
Listen, here, i have kids.

374
00:14:58,979 --> 00:15:00,369
I'm about to lose my job.

375
00:15:00,404 --> 00:15:02,384
I- I'm scrambling.

376
00:15:02,419 --> 00:15:04,521
Our business is done.

377
00:15:10,923 --> 00:15:13,536
I was in my room
getting ready for work

378
00:15:13,571 --> 00:15:14,822
When someone tried to break in.

379
00:15:14,857 --> 00:15:16,960
I heard the glass, got scared,

380
00:15:16,995 --> 00:15:17,959
And went for my gun.

381
00:15:17,994 --> 00:15:19,743
Did you get a look at
the intruder before you fired?

382
00:15:19,778 --> 00:15:20,816
Not really.

383
00:15:20,851 --> 00:15:23,007
I yelled, "i have a gun."

384
00:15:23,042 --> 00:15:24,887
I was just trying to scare him,

385
00:15:24,922 --> 00:15:27,319
But i think
i might have shot him.

386
00:15:27,354 --> 00:15:28,663
So you probably
couldn't identify him

387
00:15:28,698 --> 00:15:29,818
If you saw him again.

388
00:15:30,834 --> 00:15:32,541
You live here alone?

389
00:15:32,576 --> 00:15:35,060
Yeah. This area was supposed
to be on the way up.

390
00:15:35,095 --> 00:15:38,075
I was gonna flip the house
like on those infomercials.

391
00:15:39,945 --> 00:15:41,579
Do me a favor
and finish up.

392
00:15:41,614 --> 00:15:42,514
Why?

393
00:15:42,549 --> 00:15:43,908
Claudette's house
is five doors down.

394
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,149
I want to go over
and check it out.

395
00:15:45,184 --> 00:15:45,788
Thanks.

396
00:15:46,099 --> 00:15:47,871
All right, no problem.

397
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:49,739
That's what partners
are for, right?

398
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:56,027
This is claudette.
Leave a message.

399
00:15:56,062 --> 00:15:58,761
Hey, claudette,
are you there?

400
00:15:58,796 --> 00:15:59,759
Pick up.

401
00:15:59,794 --> 00:16:01,584
I, uh, see your car here.

402
00:16:01,619 --> 00:16:04,071
I'm, uh, i'm walking up
your front steps.

403
00:16:04,106 --> 00:16:05,686
Pick up.

404
00:16:06,212 --> 00:16:07,836
Hello? Hello? Hello?

405
00:16:07,871 --> 00:16:10,955
That's me knocking.

406
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,657
Oh, shit.

407
00:16:13,314 --> 00:16:14,936
Claudette?!

408
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,794
Claudette?!

409
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,529
Hello?! Claudette?!

410
00:16:30,905 --> 00:16:32,296
Claudette?!

411
00:16:39,942 --> 00:16:41,586
Whatever dance
you and vic got going on,

412
00:16:41,621 --> 00:16:43,034
I don't want
to be a part of it.

413
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:46,503
Vic is taking me to court to
prove that he's my son's father.

414
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:48,300
I don't want him
in our lives.

415
00:16:48,335 --> 00:16:50,050
Period.

416
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,663
I don't even want
child support, okay?

417
00:16:52,698 --> 00:16:54,743
And on a cop's salary?

418
00:16:54,778 --> 00:16:56,582
I can't imagine
you want him paying money

419
00:16:56,617 --> 00:16:59,094
That should be going
to you and your kids.

420
00:16:59,665 --> 00:17:01,709
What exactlydoyou want?

421
00:17:01,744 --> 00:17:05,629
I want sole custody
and no visitation rights.

422
00:17:05,664 --> 00:17:07,294
But the thing is,
to get that,

423
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:10,335
I have to make a case to the
judge that he's an unfit parent.

424
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:11,685
Well, vic may be
a lot of things,

425
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,292
But he cares about his kids.

426
00:17:13,327 --> 00:17:15,423
Yeah, well, when cassidy came
to my house the other day,

427
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:17,448
She had a different take
on it.

428
00:17:18,102 --> 00:17:18,929
Okay, sorry.

429
00:17:18,964 --> 00:17:20,115
It's not my business, all right.

430
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,343
It's why i called you
to come get her,

431
00:17:21,378 --> 00:17:23,901
But leeismy business.

432
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:28,295
Come on, you know this guy
better than anybody,

433
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:30,957
And with vic, it's all
about him all the time.

434
00:17:30,992 --> 00:17:34,492
What good does it do my kids
to drag their father's

435
00:17:34,527 --> 00:17:36,502
Dirty laundry into a courtroom?

436
00:17:36,537 --> 00:17:39,884
Just tell your side of things
to the judge, okay?

437
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,231
The records
are gonna be sealed.

438
00:17:41,266 --> 00:17:43,230
They never even have to know.

439
00:17:43,923 --> 00:17:46,322
Corrine, don't even think
about it as a favor to me.

440
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:48,851
Think about it as a long-Term
business decision

441
00:17:48,886 --> 00:17:52,005
In the best interest
of your kids.

442
00:17:54,368 --> 00:17:55,464
Hey.

443
00:17:55,499 --> 00:17:57,842
Crime scene's this house,
not mine.

444
00:17:57,877 --> 00:17:59,612
All this excitement
right down the block from you.

445
00:17:59,647 --> 00:18:02,499
I- I saw your car
in the driveway.

446
00:18:02,534 --> 00:18:03,579
Alternator trouble.

447
00:18:03,614 --> 00:18:05,910
Black and white gave me a lift
to work this morning,

448
00:18:05,945 --> 00:18:07,214
And then the neighbors
starting calling,

449
00:18:07,249 --> 00:18:09,805
Which is why i want you
to clear this pronto.

450
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,869
Okay.

451
00:18:11,141 --> 00:18:12,524
See you back at the barn.

452
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,719
Vinnie's found blood
around the side of the house.

453
00:18:14,754 --> 00:18:17,109
Looks like annie oakley
winged the guy.

454
00:18:17,144 --> 00:18:18,650
Let's get a sample.

455
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,187
Tried to get a reading
on shane.

456
00:18:24,677 --> 00:18:26,689
Looks like he might be
all right.

457
00:18:26,724 --> 00:18:28,312
As long as he's alive,

458
00:18:28,347 --> 00:18:30,977
We're not all right.

459
00:18:31,012 --> 00:18:32,224
What about saving your badge?

460
00:18:32,259 --> 00:18:33,492
Any ideas?

461
00:18:35,104 --> 00:18:36,743
A squeaking noise like that,

462
00:18:36,778 --> 00:18:39,510
You probably want to check
your fan belt.

463
00:18:40,581 --> 00:18:42,133
I hear you'll be moving on.

464
00:18:42,168 --> 00:18:44,904
You still got me
for another week and a half.

465
00:18:44,939 --> 00:18:46,082
I'll make a deal with you.

466
00:18:46,117 --> 00:18:48,266
You clean out your locker
and leave today

467
00:18:48,301 --> 00:18:49,962
And i'll go personally
to the chief

468
00:18:49,997 --> 00:18:53,032
And get a piece
of your pension restored.

469
00:18:58,318 --> 00:19:02,718
I, uh, still got
a few loose ends to tie up.

470
00:19:02,753 --> 00:19:05,399
I'll stick around, thanks.

471
00:19:06,935 --> 00:19:07,679
In that case,

472
00:19:07,714 --> 00:19:10,453
I want your people deployed
on this working-Girl murder.

473
00:19:10,488 --> 00:19:12,002
You want
the strike team on pimp patrol?

474
00:19:12,037 --> 00:19:14,456
In addition to murder,
this guy also manufactures

475
00:19:14,491 --> 00:19:16,049
And moves meth in quantity,

476
00:19:16,084 --> 00:19:17,648
Which if memory serves,

477
00:19:17,683 --> 00:19:21,406
Is one of the hot spots you people
are supposed to be on top of.

478
00:19:21,772 --> 00:19:24,438
Bombay's government name
is marcel letourneau.

479
00:19:24,473 --> 00:19:26,023
Ran his priors, no address.

480
00:19:26,058 --> 00:19:27,581
The girl didn't have
a twenty on him.

481
00:19:27,616 --> 00:19:28,510
Get ready for a long,

482
00:19:28,545 --> 00:19:30,463
Lazy afternoon on the stroll,

483
00:19:30,498 --> 00:19:32,990
Turning down free bjs
while we look for this idiot.

484
00:19:33,025 --> 00:19:35,116
Who said anything
about turning them down?

485
00:19:35,151 --> 00:19:35,815
Count me in.

486
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:38,329
Farrah did have info
on one of bombay's new earners.

487
00:19:38,364 --> 00:19:39,633
Calls herself capuchina.

488
00:19:39,668 --> 00:19:42,790
She probably stole farrah's
crown as bottom bitch.

489
00:19:42,825 --> 00:19:44,374
Why wouldn't she
rat her out?

490
00:19:44,409 --> 00:19:45,141
Anything else?

491
00:19:45,176 --> 00:19:46,572
Pretty much it.

492
00:19:46,607 --> 00:19:48,285
Waiting on forensics.

493
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,267
Shane and i will meet and greet
with capuchina.

494
00:19:50,302 --> 00:19:51,183
You guys hang tight.

495
00:19:51,218 --> 00:19:52,469
Stay on the lab rats.

496
00:19:52,504 --> 00:19:55,252
Let's do it.

497
00:19:55,287 --> 00:19:57,352
I'll catch up
with you outside.

498
00:20:01,483 --> 00:20:02,703
Come over here.

499
00:20:02,738 --> 00:20:04,647
What's going on?

500
00:20:04,682 --> 00:20:06,918
Danny came to see me.

501
00:20:06,953 --> 00:20:08,164
What did she want?

502
00:20:08,199 --> 00:20:09,277
First, why don't you tell me

503
00:20:09,312 --> 00:20:11,172
Why you want joint custody?

504
00:20:11,207 --> 00:20:12,487
You don't have to worry
about any of that.

505
00:20:12,522 --> 00:20:14,021
Tell me --
I'll stop worrying.

506
00:20:14,056 --> 00:20:15,900
Why do you want
shared custody?

507
00:20:15,935 --> 00:20:17,805
Because i have
shared responsibility.

508
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,555
That's bullshit, vic.

509
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:21,202
You've had 14 years

510
00:20:21,237 --> 00:20:23,594
To be the most important part
of cassidy's life.

511
00:20:23,629 --> 00:20:26,226
Never once has she been
your top priority.

512
00:20:26,261 --> 00:20:27,959
Given where she is
in her life right now,

513
00:20:27,994 --> 00:20:29,895
I'd do things differently.

514
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:32,631
I don't want to make
the same mistake with lee.

515
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:33,951
This baby gives you
a do-Over?

516
00:20:33,986 --> 00:20:36,325
How can i be an example
to our three kids,

517
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,246
Look them in the eye,

518
00:20:37,281 --> 00:20:39,588
If i just walk away
from this other child?

519
00:20:39,623 --> 00:20:41,173
I mean, they know about him,
for christ's sake.

520
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,551
How can i prove to cassidy
that i love her

521
00:20:43,586 --> 00:20:46,481
If i won't even fight
for my son?

522
00:20:46,516 --> 00:20:48,481
Now, goddamn it,
what did danny want?

523
00:20:48,516 --> 00:20:50,201
You out of the picture.

524
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:53,127
She wants me to help her
to make a case

525
00:20:53,162 --> 00:20:56,599
That you're not fit
to even see this kid.

526
00:20:56,954 --> 00:20:58,230
Are you signing on?

527
00:20:58,265 --> 00:21:00,439
I know why you think
you want this,

528
00:21:00,474 --> 00:21:02,546
But you need to ask yourself if

529
00:21:02,581 --> 00:21:03,838
You're just putting up a fight

530
00:21:03,873 --> 00:21:05,125
Just because
you're a fighter

531
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,996
Or if this is what's best
for this kid.

532
00:21:08,031 --> 00:21:10,203
-You don't --
-And before you answer,

533
00:21:11,139 --> 00:21:13,522
Just sit with the question.

534
00:21:35,421 --> 00:21:36,576
What's up?

535
00:21:36,611 --> 00:21:39,417
Shit can jump off
with these 187 cats, man.

536
00:21:47,327 --> 00:21:48,494
Detective,

537
00:21:48,495 --> 00:21:50,790
Do you smell the sickly sweet odor
ofcannabis sativa?

538
00:21:50,825 --> 00:21:52,878
-Yes, indeed i do.
-Yep.

539
00:21:54,793 --> 00:21:55,917
Sit down.

540
00:21:57,571 --> 00:21:58,522
Bag of skunk,

541
00:21:58,557 --> 00:22:00,237
Drug paraphernalia,

542
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,389
Undisclosed earnings.

543
00:22:02,424 --> 00:22:03,862
Possession
of a concealed weapon.

544
00:22:03,897 --> 00:22:05,566
Jesus christ.

545
00:22:05,601 --> 00:22:07,014
I keep that around
for protection.

546
00:22:07,049 --> 00:22:10,245
One of my regulars likes me
to use it on his nuts.

547
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,584
Who could blame him?

548
00:22:12,828 --> 00:22:13,798
What do you boys want?

549
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,150
We want to find bombay.

550
00:22:15,185 --> 00:22:17,438
That gray bitch turned you
on to me, didn't she?

551
00:22:18,301 --> 00:22:19,692
What do you know
about farrah?

552
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,623
Bitch couldn't handle
her business.

553
00:22:22,658 --> 00:22:24,799
Chose the white smoke
over her black pimp.

554
00:22:24,834 --> 00:22:26,590
Bitch is paying the price now.

555
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:28,893
Word on the street is bombay
murdered her squeeze.

556
00:22:28,928 --> 00:22:30,508
Shit, white farrah
ain't right in the mind --

557
00:22:30,543 --> 00:22:31,732
Why she got kicked to the curb.

558
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,211
I'm down for mine.

559
00:22:33,246 --> 00:22:33,775
Got vision.

560
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,415
Run bitches on my own one day,

561
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:36,626
Be an entrepreneur.

562
00:22:36,661 --> 00:22:37,962
Well,
you help us find bombay,

563
00:22:37,997 --> 00:22:40,040
And we'll sponsor you
for the rotary club.

564
00:22:40,075 --> 00:22:42,399
Baby, i don't do anal.

565
00:22:42,434 --> 00:22:44,405
What about bondage?

566
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,453
Now you can add obstructing
a police investigation to the list.

567
00:22:47,488 --> 00:22:48,981
I swear that nigga only come
around here

568
00:22:49,016 --> 00:22:50,861
To hit my shit
and hold his paper.

569
00:22:50,896 --> 00:22:52,984
-Stop fighting me.
-Two-Man will know where he's at!

570
00:22:53,019 --> 00:22:54,379
-Who's two-Man?
-His boy --

571
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:56,300
-Collects his dope money.
-Where do we find him?

572
00:22:56,335 --> 00:22:57,892
-I don't know.
-What's he look like?

573
00:22:57,927 --> 00:22:59,943
Big, ugly,
black as a flat tire.

574
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:01,502
Puts a hurt on folks
who can't pay.

575
00:23:01,537 --> 00:23:02,449
Man, talk to farrah.

576
00:23:02,484 --> 00:23:03,809
She'll know where two-Man's at.

577
00:23:03,844 --> 00:23:05,631
Word, if i knew anything else,

578
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:08,222
I'd tell y'all
'cause i don't love county.

579
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:11,462
Two-Man collects in the jungles
every mother's day --

580
00:23:12,206 --> 00:23:14,737
When the county checks
come in.

581
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,302
That's his car.

582
00:23:16,337 --> 00:23:18,174
Ronnie,
suspect vehicle's on your left.

583
00:23:18,209 --> 00:23:19,100
Pull over where you can.

584
00:23:19,135 --> 00:23:19,803
Got it.

585
00:23:19,838 --> 00:23:21,153
So how come you didn't turn us
on to this guy

586
00:23:21,188 --> 00:23:22,970
When we interviewed you
back at the barn?

587
00:23:23,005 --> 00:23:23,754
I don't know.

588
00:23:23,789 --> 00:23:25,044
I didn't think of it.

589
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:27,762
Wasn't sure if he's still
working for bombay.

590
00:23:29,321 --> 00:23:32,482
Now, we are gonna sit here
until this guy shows up,

591
00:23:32,517 --> 00:23:33,729
And you're gonna point him
out to us.

592
00:23:33,764 --> 00:23:35,745
-When are we gonna --
-Until then, we're gonna keep

593
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,293
Talking to a minimum.

594
00:23:39,092 --> 00:23:42,833
There's been a 15% increase in
b and e's the last three months

595
00:23:42,868 --> 00:23:43,864
In claudette's neighborhood,

596
00:23:43,899 --> 00:23:46,088
Mostly electronics and jewelry.

597
00:23:46,123 --> 00:23:48,711
A couple private security
companies working that area now.

598
00:23:48,746 --> 00:23:50,045
Figured they're worth
a conversation.

599
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,087
Rent-A-Cops?

600
00:23:51,122 --> 00:23:52,591
More like rent an ex-Cop.

601
00:23:52,626 --> 00:23:55,280
Prp protection is owned by guys
who used to be on the job.

602
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:56,954
We should call over.

603
00:23:56,989 --> 00:23:58,641
Maybe one of their patrols
saw something.

604
00:23:58,676 --> 00:24:00,609
Way ahead of you, dutch man.

605
00:24:00,644 --> 00:24:04,131
As a matter of fact,
this must be my guy.

606
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:06,257
Lester,
thanks for coming in.

607
00:24:06,292 --> 00:24:06,914
Are you kidding me?

608
00:24:06,949 --> 00:24:08,153
Happy to help.

609
00:24:08,188 --> 00:24:09,025
Say hi to dutch wagenbach.

610
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:09,949
-Hey.
-Hey.

611
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,467
So, ex-Cops running
a security company.

612
00:24:13,502 --> 00:24:14,361
It's genius.

613
00:24:14,396 --> 00:24:15,570
I think i see my future.

614
00:24:15,605 --> 00:24:17,041
I recognized an opportunity --

615
00:24:17,076 --> 00:24:18,001
No-Brainer, really.

616
00:24:18,036 --> 00:24:19,569
I got
a business bone myself.

617
00:24:19,604 --> 00:24:20,560
What are you into?

618
00:24:20,595 --> 00:24:22,802
Most recently vending machines,

619
00:24:22,837 --> 00:24:24,093
Not the cheap stuff --
High-End,

620
00:24:24,128 --> 00:24:25,412
Gourmet food and beverages.

621
00:24:25,447 --> 00:24:26,092
Good money there?

622
00:24:26,127 --> 00:24:27,859
Oh.

623
00:24:28,588 --> 00:24:29,778
It's not bad.

624
00:24:31,245 --> 00:24:32,696
So, what can i do
for you guys?

625
00:24:32,731 --> 00:24:35,751
Uh, recent increase in b and e's
in your service area --

626
00:24:35,786 --> 00:24:36,732
What do you make of it?

627
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:37,691
Gentrification.

628
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:38,938
You got
white people moving in

629
00:24:38,973 --> 00:24:40,081
'Cause the real estate's
cheaper,

630
00:24:40,116 --> 00:24:41,420
And they bring better gear
to steal.

631
00:24:41,455 --> 00:24:42,799
For the blacks and mexicans,

632
00:24:42,834 --> 00:24:45,147
It's a crowbar christmas.

633
00:24:45,182 --> 00:24:47,330
Company logs and files
for the past three months.

634
00:24:47,365 --> 00:24:49,385
It's a general who's who
and what's what

635
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,560
Of crimes that we responded to
in the area.

636
00:24:51,595 --> 00:24:53,994
I'd take a look at a couple
of troublemakers in particular.

637
00:24:54,029 --> 00:24:57,249
Elliott gallardo -- He's
a recently paroled crackhead,

638
00:24:57,284 --> 00:24:58,641
Lives in the area.

639
00:24:58,676 --> 00:25:00,032
The other guys's
called paolo.

640
00:25:00,067 --> 00:25:02,199
He owns the luxury pawn shop
down on sixth.

641
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:04,521
Got an interesting way
of compensating

642
00:25:04,556 --> 00:25:05,689
For his low inventory.

643
00:25:05,724 --> 00:25:07,707
You gonna break
this whole thing on your own?

644
00:25:09,884 --> 00:25:10,418
Here's a new one.

645
00:25:10,453 --> 00:25:11,802
White shirt coming out the gate.

646
00:25:11,837 --> 00:25:13,058
That's him right there.

647
00:25:13,093 --> 00:25:15,051
It's two-Man.

648
00:25:15,749 --> 00:25:16,704
Stay in the car.

649
00:25:16,739 --> 00:25:18,443
Try to keep your clothes on.

650
00:25:26,437 --> 00:25:28,592
Stop! Police!

651
00:25:29,401 --> 00:25:30,504
Look out!

652
00:25:30,772 --> 00:25:32,851
The court! Cut him off!

653
00:25:33,918 --> 00:25:35,615
Shane, wake up, brother!

654
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:36,987
Up and at 'em!

655
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:48,036
Yo, watch out, man.

656
00:25:58,297 --> 00:25:59,566
Take it easy!

657
00:25:59,614 --> 00:26:00,819
Take it easy!

658
00:26:00,854 --> 00:26:02,034
Hey!

659
00:26:02,188 --> 00:26:03,144
Shut your hole.

660
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:04,560
Don't move.

661
00:26:05,925 --> 00:26:07,509
We're looking
for bombay letourneau.

662
00:26:07,544 --> 00:26:08,244
Who?

663
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:09,875
How's that?

664
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,705
I understand you do this for
a living, except to girls.

665
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:17,361
If anybody feels the need to
write me up for excessive force,

666
00:26:17,396 --> 00:26:19,228
You better do it
in the next 10 days.

667
00:26:19,263 --> 00:26:21,096
You gonna break it!

668
00:26:21,563 --> 00:26:23,200
Get up! Get up!

669
00:26:23,235 --> 00:26:24,137
Up!

670
00:26:25,535 --> 00:26:26,934
Give me your hand.

671
00:26:33,382 --> 00:26:34,511
Tell us where he is.

672
00:26:34,546 --> 00:26:36,492
We'll forget all about
this track-And-Field tryout,

673
00:26:36,527 --> 00:26:38,350
And you get to keep this.

674
00:26:38,385 --> 00:26:40,138
That grip belong to bombay.

675
00:26:40,173 --> 00:26:43,155
Well, he won't be
needing that anymore.

676
00:26:44,824 --> 00:26:47,262
He got a new cook-Up spot
in the dust bowl

677
00:26:47,297 --> 00:26:49,796
Off the five
in glassell park.

678
00:26:51,108 --> 00:26:53,357
I think he broke
my goddamn jaw, man.

679
00:26:53,392 --> 00:26:55,815
You broke your own jaw,
asshole.

680
00:27:00,074 --> 00:27:01,217
Smells like cat piss.

681
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:02,463
Means they're in the
middle of a cook-Up.

682
00:27:02,498 --> 00:27:03,675
We could probably
catch him off guard.

683
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:04,982
So, do we wait
for uni backup?

684
00:27:05,017 --> 00:27:06,575
We take him hard to the paint,

685
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:08,099
They won't know what hit them.

686
00:27:08,134 --> 00:27:12,021
Vic, connie was always saying
you were nice,

687
00:27:12,056 --> 00:27:13,785
How you helped her.

688
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:16,532
Whatever i did to make you mad,
i'm sorry.

689
00:27:16,567 --> 00:27:18,100
My life's different now.

690
00:27:18,135 --> 00:27:18,960
Yeah, mine too.

691
00:27:18,995 --> 00:27:20,996
Four or five people
in the main trailer.

692
00:27:21,031 --> 00:27:22,124
I don't know
about the other one.

693
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:23,360
We go in, roust everyone,

694
00:27:23,395 --> 00:27:25,627
Little miss claptrap
id's our bad guy.

695
00:27:25,662 --> 00:27:27,714
You stay here
and keep your mouth shut

696
00:27:27,749 --> 00:27:29,766
Until we need you to eyeball
mack daddy.

697
00:27:29,801 --> 00:27:30,910
Come on.

698
00:27:31,694 --> 00:27:33,238
Be careful.

699
00:27:59,648 --> 00:28:00,765
Suspect down!

700
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,848
Get out of there!

701
00:28:01,883 --> 00:28:03,144
Get out of the trailer!

702
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:04,405
Let's go right now!

703
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:07,328
Get against the wall.

704
00:28:07,734 --> 00:28:09,259
Spread 'em against the wall.

705
00:28:12,642 --> 00:28:13,625
Clear!

706
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,731
-Ronnie, you got that?
-Clear! Get out of here!

707
00:28:15,766 --> 00:28:17,916
Julien, clear that other
structure!

708
00:28:18,282 --> 00:28:19,266
Clear!

709
00:28:22,468 --> 00:28:23,626
I did what i had to do.

710
00:28:23,661 --> 00:28:25,204
You fellas took a few rounds.

711
00:28:25,239 --> 00:28:26,712
I only returned two shots.

712
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:28,602
Okay, i don't want you
talking to anyone.

713
00:28:28,637 --> 00:28:29,758
O.I.S. Is on its way.

714
00:28:29,793 --> 00:28:31,763
I want you to contact
protective league.

715
00:28:31,798 --> 00:28:33,722
Get a rep standing by, okay?

716
00:28:33,757 --> 00:28:35,653
I.A.D. Will take your formal
statement at the barn.

717
00:28:35,688 --> 00:28:37,923
I'll take possession
of your weapon.

718
00:28:39,003 --> 00:28:39,843
It'll be all right.

719
00:28:39,878 --> 00:28:41,236
One of you guys get him back.

720
00:28:41,271 --> 00:28:42,656
Glad i stuck around.

721
00:28:42,691 --> 00:28:45,184
Might even pick up a letter
of commendation for this one.

722
00:28:45,219 --> 00:28:47,166
Looks good in the jacket.

723
00:28:47,201 --> 00:28:49,114
Raise my rate next gig.

724
00:28:52,044 --> 00:28:53,151
We appreciate all the help.

725
00:28:53,186 --> 00:28:54,755
Hey, just doing my part
as a citizen.

726
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:56,325
I point them out,
you put them away.

727
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,231
That sounds like a plan.

728
00:28:57,266 --> 00:28:58,396
Thanks.

729
00:29:13,132 --> 00:29:14,876
Hey, danny,
you got a minute?

730
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:16,899
What's up?

731
00:29:17,917 --> 00:29:19,222
Danielle sofer?

732
00:29:19,893 --> 00:29:20,713
Yeah.

733
00:29:20,748 --> 00:29:22,956
You are hereby ordered
to appear in family court

734
00:29:22,991 --> 00:29:24,084
On the date indicated.

735
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:25,872
Have a good day.

736
00:29:30,459 --> 00:29:32,679
You son of a bitch.

737
00:29:32,714 --> 00:29:34,903
You told me i had
until tomorrow night.

738
00:29:34,938 --> 00:29:37,093
That was before
you went behind my back

739
00:29:37,128 --> 00:29:39,256
And dragged corrine
into this.

740
00:29:39,291 --> 00:29:41,430
Shredding another family
for your own agenda

741
00:29:41,465 --> 00:29:44,999
Isn't gonna win you "world's
best mom" in a courtroom.

742
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:46,652
Guess we do this
the hard way.

743
00:29:46,687 --> 00:29:48,920
After all the shit you pulled
corrine through,

744
00:29:48,955 --> 00:29:51,426
She comes crawling back to you
like a whipped puppy.

745
00:29:51,461 --> 00:29:52,319
Jesus christ,

746
00:29:52,354 --> 00:29:55,361
What kind of hold do you have
on that poor woman anyway?

747
00:29:55,396 --> 00:29:58,924
She understands
a basic human concept --

748
00:29:59,771 --> 00:30:01,274
Children need fathers.

749
00:30:01,309 --> 00:30:02,723
Now, i'm not gonna
let you puzzle

750
00:30:02,758 --> 00:30:05,070
Over that little brain teaser
one more day

751
00:30:05,105 --> 00:30:07,409
At my son's expense.

752
00:30:19,843 --> 00:30:22,154
You missed one hell of a show
at pezuela's place.

753
00:30:22,189 --> 00:30:24,612
Two helicopters with
thermographic display,

754
00:30:24,647 --> 00:30:27,036
Field command module
with satellite uplink,

755
00:30:27,071 --> 00:30:28,768
Two dozen agents,
canine team,

756
00:30:28,803 --> 00:30:30,536
And a posse
of forensic accountants.

757
00:30:30,571 --> 00:30:33,163
And your boss came up
with jack shit and no body.

758
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:35,270
Your tax dollars at work.

759
00:30:35,305 --> 00:30:36,901
Chaffee walked himself
out onto a limb

760
00:30:36,936 --> 00:30:38,498
With the big boys in d.C.
On this one.

761
00:30:38,533 --> 00:30:40,657
And the limb just snapped.

762
00:30:41,255 --> 00:30:43,556
When can you get me into a room
with chaffee?

763
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:45,313
I'll find out.

764
00:30:45,987 --> 00:30:47,043
Hey, vic.

765
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:49,645
There was a guy here earlier,
lester spirakus -- Ex-Cop.

766
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,203
You know him?

767
00:30:50,238 --> 00:30:52,187
I've seen him around. Why?

768
00:30:52,222 --> 00:30:54,420
I got a sense you two
had some history.

769
00:30:54,455 --> 00:30:56,584
Good ob. You should be
a detective.

770
00:30:56,619 --> 00:30:59,427
Guy's an asshole,
into all kinds of wrong shit.

771
00:30:59,462 --> 00:31:00,551
Really?

772
00:31:01,061 --> 00:31:02,466
What did he do now?

773
00:31:02,501 --> 00:31:03,837
Well, maybe nothing.

774
00:31:03,872 --> 00:31:05,720
If you think
he did something shitty,

775
00:31:05,755 --> 00:31:07,783
He probably did.

776
00:31:09,223 --> 00:31:12,424
Captain, i need signatures
on last week's o.T. Reports.

777
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:17,579
I couldn't help catching
you and vic square off earlier.

778
00:31:17,954 --> 00:31:20,161
Sorry about that.
It won't happen again.

779
00:31:20,196 --> 00:31:22,058
Is that a promise
you can keep?

780
00:31:22,093 --> 00:31:23,130
Probably not.

781
00:31:23,165 --> 00:31:24,948
And not even
for the next 10 days?

782
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:26,813
Vic's being terminated.

783
00:31:26,848 --> 00:31:28,643
He'll be gone after that.

784
00:31:29,233 --> 00:31:30,298
Wow.

785
00:31:30,333 --> 00:31:31,689
I don't mean
to insert myself,

786
00:31:31,724 --> 00:31:34,181
But if i've got a personnel
problem on my hands,

787
00:31:34,216 --> 00:31:36,717
Even a short-Term, i'd like
to know what i'm dealing with.

788
00:31:39,096 --> 00:31:41,142
Captain, it's not
a secret around here.

789
00:31:41,177 --> 00:31:43,188
I mean, everybody knows
vic is the father.

790
00:31:43,223 --> 00:31:44,472
I've heard rumors.

791
00:31:44,507 --> 00:31:45,991
I tried to keep him
out of the mix.

792
00:31:46,026 --> 00:31:47,672
It's just that things
have gotten really messy.

793
00:31:47,707 --> 00:31:51,249
You ought to know that that's
the book on vic going in.

794
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:53,025
Right.

795
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:55,335
I think i was just focused
on the baby of it all.

796
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:56,887
Take whatever time you need.

797
00:31:56,922 --> 00:31:58,682
Handle your business.

798
00:31:59,769 --> 00:32:01,768
I don't want to leave you
in the lurch.

799
00:32:01,803 --> 00:32:03,761
I can look out for myself,

800
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:05,720
And you should do the same.

801
00:32:07,564 --> 00:32:09,142
Talked to elliott the crackhead.

802
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,132
Alibi checks out.

803
00:32:10,167 --> 00:32:12,574
Four people saw him stealing food
from the soup kitchen this morning.

804
00:32:12,609 --> 00:32:14,110
How do you steal
from a soup kitchen?

805
00:32:14,145 --> 00:32:15,651
That was his argument.

806
00:32:15,686 --> 00:32:16,988
How about we head over
to the pawn shop,

807
00:32:17,023 --> 00:32:17,815
Perform a three-Ball squeeze?

808
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:20,104
Hey, maybe we've been going
in the wrong direction.

809
00:32:20,139 --> 00:32:21,264
What about lester?

810
00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:22,355
That's a good one.

811
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:24,991
I've been going through
these logs he gave us.

812
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:27,592
Most of his new accounts
are from residences

813
00:32:27,627 --> 00:32:29,298
Where there
were recent 211s.

814
00:32:29,333 --> 00:32:30,246
It makes sense.

815
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:32,145
Probably gets a list of
b and e's from a friendly cop.

816
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,718
Or maybe he's staging
them himself

817
00:32:33,753 --> 00:32:35,560
To create a market
for his product.

818
00:32:35,595 --> 00:32:37,332
He's an ex-Cop,
for christ's sake.

819
00:32:37,367 --> 00:32:39,908
Then let's let him come in
and clear himself.

820
00:32:42,575 --> 00:32:43,484
You showed your hand,

821
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,829
And a covert investigation
came up empty.

822
00:32:45,864 --> 00:32:48,246
I'm out of my department on
my ass because of this thing.

823
00:32:48,281 --> 00:32:50,289
Sounds like we both
had a bad day.

824
00:32:50,324 --> 00:32:53,252
I have a way to take
our respective shit piles

825
00:32:53,287 --> 00:32:56,335
And recycle them
into something useful.

826
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:57,490
Pezuela's guard's up.

827
00:32:57,525 --> 00:32:59,766
It's gonna take more than you
turning your pockets inside out

828
00:32:59,801 --> 00:33:00,577
To get next to him.

829
00:33:00,612 --> 00:33:04,947
That's why i have to deliver
something that matters to him.

830
00:33:04,982 --> 00:33:08,249
I have to give him back
the blackmail box.

831
00:33:10,052 --> 00:33:12,615
We'd be handing the man
a loaded gun.

832
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:13,581
Do the math.

833
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:16,141
If someone like pezuela can't lean
on people to do his bidding,

834
00:33:16,176 --> 00:33:18,175
It costs him
juice with the cartel.

835
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:20,174
The harder it becomes for us
to use him

836
00:33:20,209 --> 00:33:21,600
To move up the food chain.

837
00:33:21,635 --> 00:33:22,749
Now, i'm in your wing tips,

838
00:33:22,784 --> 00:33:23,828
I'm going after the guy

839
00:33:23,863 --> 00:33:26,606
That's making pezuela
lose sleep at night.

840
00:33:26,641 --> 00:33:28,622
And the box by itself is nothing

841
00:33:28,657 --> 00:33:30,451
But a tell-All
about human weakness.

842
00:33:30,486 --> 00:33:32,399
It doesn't even get you pezuela.

843
00:33:32,434 --> 00:33:34,278
Let him put the box in play.

844
00:33:34,313 --> 00:33:37,672
That keeps him positioned
as the cartel's go-To guy.

845
00:33:37,707 --> 00:33:38,523
At the very least,

846
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,701
We get him
on conspiracy and extortion.

847
00:33:40,736 --> 00:33:43,596
With me on the inside
keeping a travel log

848
00:33:43,631 --> 00:33:46,456
Of all the dark and dirty places
he visits.

849
00:33:50,638 --> 00:33:52,773
Unless you have a better plan.

850
00:33:56,645 --> 00:33:58,463
Only one problem
with your idea.

851
00:33:58,498 --> 00:34:00,115
Pezuela's gonna smell a rat

852
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:02,455
When he gets this back
and your file's not inside it.

853
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:06,164
Especially since he knows the
agency's dogging his every move.

854
00:34:06,199 --> 00:34:08,011
That's why i've got to get it
back from aceveda

855
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,729
And put it back inside.

856
00:34:09,764 --> 00:34:12,075
You gonna be all right
with that?

857
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:13,512
This sting works,

858
00:34:13,547 --> 00:34:16,807
Maybe i'll finally be able
to hang up my kneepads.

859
00:34:16,842 --> 00:34:20,478
Keep them on just a little while
longer and this all goes away.

860
00:34:20,513 --> 00:34:22,831
Aceveda's not gonna
just hand it over.

861
00:34:22,866 --> 00:34:24,884
I already went to his office
today and asked.

862
00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:27,653
I've known david a long time.

863
00:34:27,688 --> 00:34:30,387
It's all about how you ask.

864
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:33,895
I'm working undercover
for i.C.E.

865
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:34,911
The box is back in play.

866
00:34:34,946 --> 00:34:37,561
We need olivia's file
in order to sell it to pezuela.

867
00:34:37,596 --> 00:34:38,983
When the hell
did this happen?

868
00:34:39,018 --> 00:34:40,433
You said something
this morning

869
00:34:40,468 --> 00:34:42,217
About wanting
to see justice done.

870
00:34:42,252 --> 00:34:44,497
Time to jump on board
the karma train.

871
00:34:44,532 --> 00:34:46,743
I have to handle pezuela
very carefully.

872
00:34:46,778 --> 00:34:47,709
He can hurt me.

873
00:34:47,744 --> 00:34:49,433
And you, you say you want
to bring him down?

874
00:34:49,468 --> 00:34:50,945
You were just working
for the man.

875
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,280
She had no choice.

876
00:34:52,315 --> 00:34:53,545
Look, i'm sorry,

877
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,907
But vic doesn't make a very
compelling character witness.

878
00:34:55,942 --> 00:34:57,792
Holding on to your file
gives me a card to play

879
00:34:57,827 --> 00:34:59,858
In case you're ever tempted
to switch sides again.

880
00:34:59,893 --> 00:35:01,890
Here's what happens if you don't
give up the file.

881
00:35:01,925 --> 00:35:03,463
Pezuela
doesn't take the bait.

882
00:35:03,498 --> 00:35:04,966
I.C.E. Doesn't understand why,

883
00:35:05,001 --> 00:35:06,737
So they put his balls
through the ringer

884
00:35:06,772 --> 00:35:09,626
Just on general principle,
and he gives up olivia anyway.

885
00:35:09,661 --> 00:35:12,641
Then i roll on you
for blackmailing me.

886
00:35:12,676 --> 00:35:15,676
And i back her story.

887
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,400
You two make quite a team.

888
00:35:35,435 --> 00:35:37,725
You know how much of my life i
spent in interrogation rooms?

889
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,327
It's quieter in here.
You mind?

890
00:35:39,362 --> 00:35:41,175
No, i'm fine with it.

891
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:42,138
What's up, guys?

892
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:44,333
You mind if
i cut to the chase?

893
00:35:44,368 --> 00:35:45,833
I'd love that.

894
00:35:45,868 --> 00:35:48,430
The more security systems you
sell, the more money you make,

895
00:35:48,465 --> 00:35:50,413
And what better way
to stimulate demand

896
00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:53,424
Than breaking into houses.

897
00:35:57,355 --> 00:35:59,732
I spent 15 years on the job.

898
00:35:59,767 --> 00:36:03,310
This is a hell of a way to thank
me for my time and service.

899
00:36:03,345 --> 00:36:05,237
There's a quick
and easy way to clear this up.

900
00:36:05,272 --> 00:36:06,784
Perp got grazed by a bullet,

901
00:36:06,819 --> 00:36:08,741
Left a trail of blood.

902
00:36:08,776 --> 00:36:10,777
What? You want
to check me out?

903
00:36:11,353 --> 00:36:13,041
Why didn't you say so?

904
00:36:20,992 --> 00:36:24,342
53. Still ripped.

905
00:36:24,377 --> 00:36:26,581
You guys are too busy on the job

906
00:36:26,616 --> 00:36:28,785
To get to the gym regularly.

907
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:31,526
I remember.

908
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:36,849
Um, can you turn around so we
can see the back of your legs?

909
00:36:42,394 --> 00:36:44,688
Liking that ass?

910
00:36:45,395 --> 00:36:49,238
Can i go now or do you want
to tickle my balls?

911
00:36:49,273 --> 00:36:50,926
Uh, your partner,
j.R. Cornelius,

912
00:36:50,961 --> 00:36:51,700
I'd like to talk to him.

913
00:36:51,735 --> 00:36:53,092
How do i reach him?

914
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:54,449
He's on vacation.

915
00:36:54,484 --> 00:36:55,552
Since when?

916
00:36:55,587 --> 00:36:56,586
Last weekend.

917
00:36:56,621 --> 00:36:59,172
J.R. Wasn't in town
when this happened,

918
00:36:59,207 --> 00:37:01,724
But you're welcome
to knock on his door.

919
00:37:02,878 --> 00:37:05,719
Woman's here to see someone
from the strike team.

920
00:37:05,754 --> 00:37:07,612
Somewhere we could talk?

921
00:37:07,647 --> 00:37:09,123
Bombay's as hard
as they get,

922
00:37:09,158 --> 00:37:10,599
But he
didn't kill no girl.

923
00:37:10,634 --> 00:37:11,916
Why do you say that?

924
00:37:11,951 --> 00:37:13,070
'Cause i saw who did.

925
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:14,643
I'm working the track.

926
00:37:14,678 --> 00:37:16,181
Two-Man rolls up on amber,

927
00:37:16,216 --> 00:37:17,298
Tells her to get in.

928
00:37:17,333 --> 00:37:19,379
Bitch wasn't trying to hear it
on account of knowing

929
00:37:19,414 --> 00:37:20,120
What's in store.

930
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:22,012
Well, just 'cause
she got in his car

931
00:37:22,047 --> 00:37:23,869
Doesn't mean
that he killed her.

932
00:37:23,904 --> 00:37:26,164
I'm gonna be real with you.

933
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:30,492
Nigga gets a cut of what he
collects and any pussy he wants.

934
00:37:30,527 --> 00:37:31,953
Only he ain't about
hitting no trim.

935
00:37:31,988 --> 00:37:33,380
He about banging
those shorties.

936
00:37:33,415 --> 00:37:34,505
So he's into rough stuff.

937
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:36,983
Shit. That brother don't even
get his swole on.

938
00:37:37,018 --> 00:37:38,987
Two-Man
'bout bringing the pain.

939
00:37:39,022 --> 00:37:41,085
All the bitches he sent
to killah king with

940
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,390
Broken bones and shit.

941
00:37:42,425 --> 00:37:43,560
That's bad for business.

942
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:44,661
Bombay put up with that?

943
00:37:44,696 --> 00:37:46,783
He never let him beat
on his earners, but, daddy,

944
00:37:46,818 --> 00:37:49,762
It was open season
on low-End skeezers.

945
00:37:49,797 --> 00:37:52,397
Amber should have taken her beat
down same as every other ho.

946
00:37:52,432 --> 00:37:54,464
The minute she said "no,"
it was on.

947
00:37:54,499 --> 00:37:57,595
Two-Man snatched her by the
hair, bashed her in the face,

948
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:59,317
Banged her head against the car,

949
00:37:59,352 --> 00:38:01,676
And threw her in the back.

950
00:38:01,711 --> 00:38:02,399
When he drove off,

951
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:07,096
You know, you'd have saved
everybody a lot of time

952
00:38:07,131 --> 00:38:09,543
And ammunition if you would have
told us this before.

953
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:11,708
If i'd have snitched
on bombay's dude,

954
00:38:11,743 --> 00:38:15,264
I'd be in the mortuary
right behind gray girl.

955
00:38:15,299 --> 00:38:18,002
Pimp juice dead.
It's all good.

956
00:38:18,037 --> 00:38:22,216
Be even safer if you tossed
two-Man in and lose the key.

957
00:38:23,543 --> 00:38:25,462
You seem
like a good person,

958
00:38:26,222 --> 00:38:28,496
And you're just trying
to do the right thing.

959
00:38:28,885 --> 00:38:31,652
Maybe you saw two-Man do those
things, maybe you didn't.

960
00:38:31,687 --> 00:38:32,420
I know what i seen.

961
00:38:32,455 --> 00:38:34,825
The point is, you're in a cloud of
chronic all day every day.

962
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,646
You're not a credible witness.

963
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:39,837
And i also have concerns
about your personal safety.

964
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:42,994
What if you testify
and we don't get a conviction?

965
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:45,245
I don't want anything
happening to you.

966
00:38:46,281 --> 00:38:49,362
I'm gonna treat this
as an anonymous tip.

967
00:38:49,397 --> 00:38:53,675
I ain't mad,
keeping it in the cut.

968
00:38:54,305 --> 00:38:57,437
Looks like j.R. Decided
to vacation in the e.R.

969
00:38:57,472 --> 00:38:59,109
Out in riverside.

970
00:38:59,144 --> 00:39:00,712
That's news to me.

971
00:39:00,747 --> 00:39:02,458
He was being treated
for a gunshot wound.

972
00:39:02,493 --> 00:39:04,134
Arrived two hours
after the shooting.

973
00:39:04,169 --> 00:39:07,423
Told the doctors he was
an ex-Cop who was wounded

974
00:39:07,458 --> 00:39:09,271
When his gun
accidently discharged.

975
00:39:09,306 --> 00:39:11,107
He always was clumsy.

976
00:39:11,142 --> 00:39:12,597
Riverside p.D.
Picked him up.

977
00:39:12,632 --> 00:39:14,435
They're bringing him
back here now.

978
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:15,227
You know what it'll mean for us

979
00:39:15,262 --> 00:39:17,310
To be able to clear
all these open b and e's.

980
00:39:17,345 --> 00:39:19,359
Go easier for you
if you tell us what happened.

981
00:39:20,686 --> 00:39:22,840
We found blood
at the crime scene.

982
00:39:22,875 --> 00:39:25,868
When we test it,
it's gonna match j.R.'S.

983
00:39:31,267 --> 00:39:32,919
He's my partner.

984
00:39:33,566 --> 00:39:35,747
Well, i respect
that kind of loyalty,

985
00:39:35,782 --> 00:39:38,173
And since he's got more to lose
than you do,

986
00:39:38,208 --> 00:39:40,241
I hope he does, too.

987
00:39:40,873 --> 00:39:43,257
I walk on the b and e's.

988
00:39:43,292 --> 00:39:45,607
Trespassing and vandalism.

989
00:39:45,642 --> 00:39:48,954
Got to make sure you're out of
the home-Protection business.

990
00:39:51,124 --> 00:39:52,572
We thought
the house was empty.

991
00:39:52,607 --> 00:39:55,182
I was on the lookout
when he went in.

992
00:39:55,217 --> 00:39:56,738
I heard the gunshot,

993
00:39:56,773 --> 00:39:58,476
And then he came running out.

994
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:01,362
Then i drove him to his car.

995
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:04,281
Shit.

996
00:40:04,514 --> 00:40:07,900
Bombay never posted lookouts
during a cook-Up.

997
00:40:07,935 --> 00:40:09,888
He needed everybody in the lab.

998
00:40:09,923 --> 00:40:12,531
So why did he come out
guns blazing?

999
00:40:12,566 --> 00:40:15,140
-The phone call.
-What phone call?

1000
00:40:15,175 --> 00:40:16,784
Somebody called his cell,

1001
00:40:16,819 --> 00:40:19,820
Said there were cops outside
are gonna kill him.

1002
00:40:19,855 --> 00:40:21,166
He told us to get down,

1003
00:40:21,201 --> 00:40:23,081
Went for his gun,

1004
00:40:23,116 --> 00:40:24,962
Started shooting.

1005
00:40:42,111 --> 00:40:43,545
You spun that sob story

1006
00:40:43,557 --> 00:40:45,771
About killing your
girlfriend?

1007
00:40:45,806 --> 00:40:48,996
Your pimp you set up bombay
for a death-By-Cop payback

1008
00:40:49,031 --> 00:40:50,216
For kicking you out?

1009
00:40:50,251 --> 00:40:51,782
He's the one who started her
on the pipe.

1010
00:40:51,817 --> 00:40:53,140
He got what he deserved.

1011
00:40:57,251 --> 00:41:00,117
I don't give a shit
about your goddamn pimp!

1012
00:41:00,649 --> 00:41:01,717
You understand?!

1013
00:41:01,752 --> 00:41:02,750
You called him.

1014
00:41:02,785 --> 00:41:05,221
You warned him
so he'd come out blasting!

1015
00:41:05,256 --> 00:41:08,347
You used me! You used
one of my guys as a shooter!

1016
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:11,438
You could have gotten us
all killed, you sick bitch!

1017
00:41:11,473 --> 00:41:12,310
Oh, i used you.

1018
00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:13,968
Played you same as last time.

1019
00:41:14,003 --> 00:41:15,175
I remember it all now.

1020
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:17,933
You were an asshole
back then, too.

1021
00:41:22,311 --> 00:41:25,120
You just keep getting
more pathetic and miserable.

1022
00:41:25,155 --> 00:41:27,648
I still got you handling
my business for me.

1023
00:41:27,683 --> 00:41:29,450
May not be so pretty any more,

1024
00:41:29,485 --> 00:41:31,183
But i am walking, talking pussy,

1025
00:41:31,218 --> 00:41:33,438
And you let me lead you around
by your dick.

1026
00:41:36,498 --> 00:41:38,493
You ever thought
about just cutting it off?

1027
00:41:38,528 --> 00:41:40,648
Free your mind
once and for all?

1028
00:41:40,982 --> 00:41:42,987
Ha ha. Ha ha.
