1
00:00:01,231 --> 00:00:02,197
Previously on "the shield"...

2
00:00:02,207 --> 00:00:06,576
I set up an appeals panel
to review your retirement.

3
00:00:06,611 --> 00:00:08,360
The review board
is ready to see you now.

4
00:00:08,395 --> 00:00:09,839
Detective Mackey?!

5
00:00:10,384 --> 00:00:11,828
This is Cruz Pezuela.

6
00:00:11,863 --> 00:00:13,386
This city needs cops like you.

7
00:00:13,421 --> 00:00:14,875
I can get you your job back.

8
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,289
I have larger interests
I'd like to protect.

9
00:00:17,324 --> 00:00:19,563
- I may have future jobs for you.
- Good.

10
00:00:19,598 --> 00:00:21,767
The Mexican mob
is buying up Farmington?

11
00:00:21,802 --> 00:00:25,750
Aramboles was a Mexican intelligence officer
assigned to investigate the cartels.

12
00:00:25,785 --> 00:00:27,682
The speculation was
he switched sides.

13
00:00:27,717 --> 00:00:28,856
Pezuela is the connection.

14
00:00:28,891 --> 00:00:31,770
I can't tackle Cruz alone,
so there's got to be trust.

15
00:00:31,805 --> 00:00:33,558
I got to take out aramboles.

16
00:00:33,695 --> 00:00:34,841
Call Pezuela.

17
00:00:34,876 --> 00:00:38,509
On the ride home, you can explain to him
how you just lost his trunk full of leverage.

18
00:00:38,544 --> 00:00:41,260
This is a paternity suit
for rabi kormas.

19
00:00:41,295 --> 00:00:43,942
Senator bradwell,
campfire boys, blackmail.

20
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:47,356
That's how Pezuela's gotten everyone
on board the train to carteltown.

21
00:00:47,391 --> 00:00:50,107
You think this goes far enough
up the ladder to save my job?

22
00:00:50,142 --> 00:00:52,534
The Armenian money train
that got robbed --

23
00:00:52,569 --> 00:00:53,411
That was Vic.

24
00:00:53,446 --> 00:00:55,204
I'm gonna have to
deliver them, too.

25
00:00:55,239 --> 00:00:56,963
You can't kill
Vic's wife and kids.

26
00:00:56,998 --> 00:00:57,725
Sorry.

27
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,480
You both need to come with me.

28
00:00:59,515 --> 00:01:00,561
why?
What's going on?

29
00:01:00,596 --> 00:01:01,680
Get in the Van.

30
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:03,653
no.

31
00:01:03,793 --> 00:01:05,529
Just stay here, okay?

32
00:01:05,895 --> 00:01:07,307
I'm Ellis rezian.

33
00:01:07,342 --> 00:01:09,898
I made a bad judgment call
pairing up with your rival diro.

34
00:01:09,933 --> 00:01:12,576
She's got some bad intel
about a couple of innocent...

35
00:01:12,611 --> 00:01:13,874
Who would she use
to do the whack?

36
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:15,149
Zadofian.

37
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,212
Rezian pulled off a power play,
taking control of the Armenian operations.

38
00:01:19,247 --> 00:01:21,321
You either join him
or you bleed out here and die.

39
00:01:21,356 --> 00:01:22,521
We just got a shots-fired call.

40
00:01:22,556 --> 00:01:23,417
It's Corrine's address.

41
00:01:23,452 --> 00:01:24,279
Where's my family?!

42
00:01:24,314 --> 00:01:25,405
I don't know.

43
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,462
Oh, Jesus Christ.

44
00:01:26,497 --> 00:01:30,782
When that money train was robbed,
the organization lost over $2 million.

45
00:01:30,817 --> 00:01:32,053
I need to be reimbursed.

46
00:01:32,088 --> 00:01:35,276
I'll make sure that your cop friends
and their families don't get hurt.

47
00:01:35,311 --> 00:01:38,889
Your favors and your protection
will serve as ongoing payment.

48
00:01:38,924 --> 00:01:42,468
He said he was doing it to protect us
from something you did.

49
00:01:42,503 --> 00:01:43,771
Shane's sending us a warning.

50
00:01:43,806 --> 00:01:45,542
We're gonna crush him.

51
00:01:47,126 --> 00:01:57,650

Mara!

Vic!

57
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:37,535
Vic!

58
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:37,905
Shut up!

59
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,191
Vic, listen, man.

60
00:02:39,634 --> 00:02:40,225
Shut up

61
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,410
you don't understand.

62
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:43,351
Corrine and my kids?

63
00:02:43,386 --> 00:02:47,375
Vic, you don't understand.
Vic, I saved their lives.

64
00:02:49,096 --> 00:02:52,006
The armenians know
about the money train!

65
00:02:53,054 --> 00:02:53,794
What do they know?

66
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:55,751
You cozied up to diro,
got her spooked.

67
00:02:55,786 --> 00:02:57,419
She started
to turn over rocks.

68
00:02:57,454 --> 00:02:59,731
She made you
for the money-train grab.

69
00:03:01,403 --> 00:03:04,446
There's only four people
who knew we did that robbery,

70
00:03:04,481 --> 00:03:06,269
and three of them
are in this room.

71
00:03:06,304 --> 00:03:08,022
The other one,
you blew to pieces.

72
00:03:08,057 --> 00:03:11,134
- You told her it was us and left yourself out.
- You think I'm an idiot?

73
00:03:11,169 --> 00:03:15,482
Eventually that Armenian bitch and her mob buddies
will figure out that I was involved.

74
00:03:15,517 --> 00:03:17,502
Yeah, and me too, asshole.

75
00:03:17,537 --> 00:03:19,487
Diro greenlit your family.

76
00:03:19,804 --> 00:03:22,510
When I heard about the hit,
I went back to rezian,

77
00:03:22,545 --> 00:03:24,669
and I made a deal
to shut down diro.

78
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,959
Now rezian thinks that the both
of you are behind it, too.

79
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,413
Oh, Jesus Christ.

80
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,888
I'm paying off your debt in favors
to keep you and your family safe.

81
00:03:38,649 --> 00:03:40,646
You're paying off
my money-train debt?

82
00:03:40,681 --> 00:03:42,643
What the hell
have you gotten us into?

83
00:03:42,678 --> 00:03:44,522
I'm on an Island here for you --

84
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,144
For you and your family.

85
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:50,219
Rezian told me who diro hired
for the hit.

86
00:03:50,254 --> 00:03:52,415
That was the blood
in your house.

87
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:54,652
I put a bullet
in the asshole.

88
00:03:55,616 --> 00:03:57,362
What's the asshole's name?

89
00:03:57,397 --> 00:03:58,670
Zadofian.

90
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:00,541
He's Armenian muscle.

91
00:04:00,576 --> 00:04:02,858
I capped him
and he ran off.

92
00:04:02,893 --> 00:04:05,472
You let the guy who was hired
to kill my family get away?

93
00:04:05,507 --> 00:04:07,573
I stopped him from killing
Corrine and your kids.

94
00:04:07,608 --> 00:04:08,861
And he's still out there?

95
00:04:08,896 --> 00:04:12,174
Look, Vic, if we just can work
together on this thing --

96
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:14,393
We don't work together
on shit anymore.

97
00:04:15,029 --> 00:04:16,790
I'm gonna find zadofian,

98
00:04:17,063 --> 00:04:18,883
and I'll find out the truth, too.

99
00:04:19,268 --> 00:04:21,480
Until then,
you stay out of my way.

100
00:04:21,934 --> 00:04:23,717
Yeah, I get it.
I know you hate me.

101
00:04:23,752 --> 00:04:25,408
Hey! Hey!

102
00:04:25,443 --> 00:04:26,479
But you got to understand, man.

103
00:04:26,514 --> 00:04:29,010
I would never do anything
to hurt your family.

104
00:04:32,795 --> 00:04:34,501
Lem was family.

105
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,906
- What the hell was that?
- Are you OK?

106
00:04:56,941 --> 00:04:58,502
- Are you okay?
- What the hell was that?

107
00:04:58,537 --> 00:05:00,709
Just hold on.
Hey, buddy. Everything's fine.

108
00:05:00,744 --> 00:05:02,881
- Look, I'm sorry.
- A washcloth in my mouth?

109
00:05:02,888 --> 00:05:04,485
Vic would never do anything
to hurt us.

110
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,266
He tied me up,
and he beat the shit out of you.

111
00:05:08,301 --> 00:05:10,746
What is that,
the good-neighbor policy?

112
00:05:10,781 --> 00:05:14,010
I got word that the armenians
were coming after Vic for the money-train robbery.

113
00:05:14,045 --> 00:05:16,242
I scooped up Corrine and Cassidy
to keep them safe.

114
00:05:16,277 --> 00:05:18,405
I didn't have a chance
to call him and fill him in.

115
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,218
You protect his family, and he
pays you back by terrorizing us?

116
00:05:22,253 --> 00:05:25,546
It was just him thinking
I was taking our bad blood to the next level.

117
00:05:26,072 --> 00:05:29,956
That bad blood
is spraying all over this family.

118
00:05:31,616 --> 00:05:33,929
Look, I keep trying to do
the right thing.

119
00:05:36,283 --> 00:05:38,865
Vic is never gonna forgive you
for Lem.

120
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,964
You got to get away
from him.

121
00:05:42,213 --> 00:05:44,108
It's the only way
you're gonna get right.

122
00:05:46,418 --> 00:05:49,140
So what happens
with your hearing now?

123
00:05:49,486 --> 00:05:51,589
Walking out
didn't weigh in my favor.

124
00:05:55,068 --> 00:05:57,746
S.I.s. Offered me a spot.
I think I'm gonna take it.

125
00:05:59,739 --> 00:06:01,516
I'm not staying in Farmington
with shane.

126
00:06:07,373 --> 00:06:10,490
Thanks for coming out so late.
I appreciate the gig.

127
00:06:11,095 --> 00:06:13,373
Security work's
been pretty lean lately.

128
00:06:14,547 --> 00:06:17,392
You'd think five years on the force
would qualify you for more stuff.

129
00:06:18,924 --> 00:06:20,992
I'm not sure how you want to
handle the payment.

130
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:22,044
Yeah.

131
00:06:22,761 --> 00:06:24,450
This will handle
the first week.

132
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:32,820
I ruffled some Armenian feathers.
Looks like they might want to strike back.

133
00:06:32,855 --> 00:06:35,063
I need you to look after Corrine
and my family.

134
00:06:35,165 --> 00:06:36,919
I'll be like a mother bird
with her eggs.

135
00:06:36,954 --> 00:06:38,741
The guy's name is zadofian.

136
00:06:38,776 --> 00:06:40,843
I'll E-mail you
his interpol photo.

137
00:06:40,878 --> 00:06:42,876
My family's staying
at my place.

138
00:06:42,911 --> 00:06:46,384
They can't know that they're being watched.
They don't know anything about the threat.

139
00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:47,772
I don't want them scared.

140
00:06:47,981 --> 00:06:48,921
Not a problem.

141
00:06:49,505 --> 00:06:50,615
You got a gun?

142
00:06:51,455 --> 00:06:52,483
Good.

143
00:06:52,825 --> 00:06:54,008
No chances.

144
00:06:54,444 --> 00:06:57,038
You had me arrested.
You make the case go away.

145
00:06:57,073 --> 00:06:59,598
I already took a big-ass risk
losing those ledgers.

146
00:06:59,633 --> 00:07:03,548
When I start altering reports,
I will be in a jail cell right next to you.

147
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:04,469
now,
That does not help you.

148
00:07:04,504 --> 00:07:08,142
As long as I'm locked up in here
and diro is out there, everything is at risk.

149
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:12,035
Diro's probably back in munich
playing quarters with co-eds by now.

150
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:16,415
Diro kesakian has been working
for her father's illegal businesses since she was 15,

151
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,413
and she's not
going to stop now.

152
00:07:18,448 --> 00:07:20,261
I need to find her.

153
00:07:20,311 --> 00:07:22,666
I'm not your Armenian lojack.
I don't know where she is.

154
00:07:22,701 --> 00:07:24,972
Zadofian,
that hit man that you shot,

155
00:07:25,007 --> 00:07:26,669
he'll know
where diro's hiding.

156
00:07:26,704 --> 00:07:27,802
Find him.

157
00:07:27,837 --> 00:07:29,395
Turn him over to my men.

158
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:32,728
They will extract the truth,
and I'll get diro.

159
00:07:32,763 --> 00:07:36,562
And where do Armenian hit men
nurse belly wounds these days?

160
00:07:37,143 --> 00:07:39,953
He's dick-sweet on this little
filipina whore.

161
00:07:39,988 --> 00:07:41,604
Street name's darla.

162
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:45,205
Find zadofian in one piece
before your police friends do.

163
00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:52,827
How'd your hearing go
last night?

164
00:07:52,862 --> 00:07:53,773
You haven't heard?

165
00:07:54,277 --> 00:07:56,078
I'll let it be
a surprise.

166
00:07:56,987 --> 00:07:58,621
I'm tired of blood.

167
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,726
Ronnie, you're taking lead
on anything gang-related.

168
00:08:02,761 --> 00:08:06,552
Vic, until your status is determined,
can't have you headlining anything.

169
00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:10,961
Captain, car dragged two bodies
all the way down kearney street around the corner.

170
00:08:10,996 --> 00:08:13,152
Victims were Salvadoran.
Castillo's crew.

171
00:08:13,187 --> 00:08:16,328
Salvadoran and Mexicans
both run a piece of this block.

172
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:18,175
Until now, they've always
shared lunch money.

173
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:22,059
Call in Vendrell. The whole team figures out
who broke the truce and why.

174
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,009
Can I help you?

175
00:08:25,219 --> 00:08:27,320
Agent olivia murray,
I.c.E.

176
00:08:27,755 --> 00:08:31,569
You folks usually lob the obligatory courtesy call
before you muscle in on a case.

177
00:08:31,604 --> 00:08:32,906
I'm not a muscling
kind of gal.

178
00:08:32,941 --> 00:08:35,345
Here unofficially --
Curiosity call.

179
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,714
What's your unofficial
curiosity?

180
00:08:37,749 --> 00:08:40,940
Captain Wyms.
Special team member detective Vic Mackey.

181
00:08:40,975 --> 00:08:42,302
I share, you share?

182
00:08:43,476 --> 00:08:45,797
Dragging bodies to designate
new boundaries in blood

183
00:08:45,832 --> 00:08:48,119
is right out of
the "manada de muerte" handbook.

184
00:08:48,259 --> 00:08:49,100
Death mob?

185
00:08:49,135 --> 00:08:52,959
Cartel mercenaries --
Ex-Mexican military and federales.

186
00:08:52,994 --> 00:08:55,716
Make 10 times as much
protecting the cartels than they do citizens.

187
00:08:55,751 --> 00:08:57,635
What in God's name
are they doing in Farmington?

188
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,015
That's the curious part.

189
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,947
Since those San marcos house murders,
this place has been a hot zone.

190
00:09:02,068 --> 00:09:03,145
Tell me about it

191
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,722
all that blood,
all those hacked-up body parts,

192
00:09:05,757 --> 00:09:08,438
and I.c.E. Couldn't flesh out
a single player or an illegal operation.

193
00:09:08,473 --> 00:09:10,652
Our bureau Chief shut down
my investigation.

194
00:09:10,687 --> 00:09:11,983
You're freelancing.

195
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,322
Trying to kick-start your case.

196
00:09:13,357 --> 00:09:17,198
If I can tie the cartel
to a local player, olivia's back in the hood.

197
00:09:17,697 --> 00:09:21,639
We could use the jackets
of those Mexican cops who've fallen from gracia.

198
00:09:21,674 --> 00:09:22,887
I'll make it happen.

199
00:09:23,609 --> 00:09:24,448
Okay.

200
00:09:24,483 --> 00:09:26,013
Barn's at your disposal.

201
00:09:30,829 --> 00:09:33,851
Oh. Next time,
take the bus, boys.

202
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:40,912
Some banger over in county
was threatening to off a cop's family.

203
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:44,878
Cass, go check on your brother
and sister.

204
00:09:44,913 --> 00:09:45,937
I'm old enough
to hear this.

205
00:09:45,972 --> 00:09:46,769
It's okay.

206
00:09:47,332 --> 00:09:48,227
It's all right.

207
00:09:49,807 --> 00:09:53,489
Now, the guard thought the
prisoner was talking about me.

208
00:09:53,524 --> 00:09:54,809
He tipped off shane.

209
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,753
When shane couldn't get
in touch with me, he panicked,

210
00:09:57,788 --> 00:09:59,610
put you guys away
for your own safety.

211
00:09:59,645 --> 00:10:01,416
What about the blood
in our house?

212
00:10:01,451 --> 00:10:03,153
I just talked
to Wyms about that.

213
00:10:03,188 --> 00:10:05,849
Looks like it was a break-in
gone sideways.

214
00:10:05,884 --> 00:10:08,476
They get nervous,
they hear someone coming,

215
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,553
and they accidentally cap
one of their own guys.

216
00:10:10,588 --> 00:10:12,231
I'm supposed to believe
all this happened

217
00:10:12,266 --> 00:10:15,473
at the same time shane locks us
in a box for our own well-being?

218
00:10:17,894 --> 00:10:19,227
Shane overreacted.

219
00:10:19,262 --> 00:10:20,712
His heart was
in the right place,

220
00:10:20,747 --> 00:10:23,736
but unfortunately, his brain
was a couple of steps behind.

221
00:10:25,539 --> 00:10:27,253
And we were never
in any danger?

222
00:10:27,288 --> 00:10:28,912
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

223
00:10:28,947 --> 00:10:30,536
We're not
in any danger now?

224
00:10:30,885 --> 00:10:31,874
no.

225
00:10:31,994 --> 00:10:33,302
I promise.

226
00:10:34,737 --> 00:10:37,173
Listen, this whole thing
really rattled my cage.

227
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:39,701
I'd really, really love it
if you'd hang around here.

228
00:10:39,736 --> 00:10:43,806
I mean, I'd just feel better
if you were under my roof for a couple of days --

229
00:10:43,841 --> 00:10:46,017
Close to me, okay?

230
00:10:55,462 --> 00:10:56,154
Vic!

231
00:11:00,831 --> 00:11:03,186
Saw him behind your neighbor's
shrubs watching your door.

232
00:11:05,803 --> 00:11:07,237
I need those files.

233
00:11:07,272 --> 00:11:08,251
This zadofian?

234
00:11:08,286 --> 00:11:09,516
Actually, it's not.

235
00:11:09,551 --> 00:11:10,747
Who the hell is it?

236
00:11:10,782 --> 00:11:11,794
Don't ask.

237
00:11:12,764 --> 00:11:13,953
Hey, screw.
Screw.

238
00:11:15,481 --> 00:11:16,506
Don't you move.

239
00:11:17,668 --> 00:11:19,432
See you, sweetie.
See you later.

240
00:11:22,894 --> 00:11:24,336
Pezuela send you after me?

241
00:11:24,371 --> 00:11:25,778
Might as well kill me.

242
00:11:26,342 --> 00:11:28,549
If I don't return
la caja de pecado, I'm dead.

243
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:30,498
The box of sins?

244
00:11:30,874 --> 00:11:32,293
That's clever.

245
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,619
All those files.

246
00:11:34,931 --> 00:11:37,966
All those blackmail files
I took from your trunk.

247
00:11:38,249 --> 00:11:42,265
I spent 21/2 years, hundreds of thousands of dollars
gathering that intel.

248
00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:46,386
That's political payback
for L.A.'s most upstanding and influential citizens.

249
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,073
You sound a little bitter.

250
00:11:50,108 --> 00:11:54,510
I watched those hypocrites do everything
from fixing parking tickets to ordering murders.

251
00:11:54,898 --> 00:11:57,302
I'm the one who gave Pezuela
his leverage --

252
00:11:57,337 --> 00:11:59,476
Made him indispensable
to the cartel.

253
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:02,677
And he's gonna pay you back by
putting a bullet in your head.

254
00:12:03,102 --> 00:12:04,764
That sucks.

255
00:12:09,224 --> 00:12:12,294
The cartel doesn't know
you lost their blackmail files.

256
00:12:13,376 --> 00:12:15,008
Pezuela either.

257
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:16,564
no.

258
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,811
Who sent the death squad
up here?

259
00:12:18,846 --> 00:12:22,550
Mexican drug lords are getting nervous
about their investment in Los Angeles,

260
00:12:22,585 --> 00:12:25,243
especially the Salvadoran
resistance.

261
00:12:25,834 --> 00:12:28,478
They sent up manada de muerte
six days ago to help.

262
00:12:28,513 --> 00:12:31,123
Why'd they draw the blood lines
down kearney street?

263
00:12:31,158 --> 00:12:34,249
Pezuela is expanding
his development.

264
00:12:34,778 --> 00:12:36,797
It's where he wants
his new hotel.

265
00:12:39,466 --> 00:12:40,487
Wait!

266
00:12:40,989 --> 00:12:43,176
You're just gonna leave me
chained here?

267
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:46,553
Trust me, I could do worse.

268
00:12:57,198 --> 00:12:59,099
Got a call from county
this morning

269
00:12:59,134 --> 00:13:02,053
wanting to know if they should
issue a monthly guest pass.

270
00:13:02,088 --> 00:13:04,973
Seems like you've been making
regular visits to Ellis rezian.

271
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:08,772
The armenians had a front-row seat
to this whole Mexican-Salvadoran beef.

272
00:13:08,807 --> 00:13:10,404
He's facing a charge.

273
00:13:10,439 --> 00:13:13,403
I'm just trying to convince him
it's in his best interest to share the knowledge.

274
00:13:29,772 --> 00:13:32,838
Vice had a C.I. Who got
patched up by an Armenian doc.

275
00:13:32,873 --> 00:13:36,165
If zadofian's looking to get sewn up outside the system,
this is where he'd probably go.

276
00:13:36,285 --> 00:13:39,558
"Dr. Edna lucine --
Bow-wow and meow."

277
00:13:39,697 --> 00:13:40,604
What, she's a vet?

278
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:41,939
Hate to be part
of that h.m.o.

279
00:13:41,974 --> 00:13:43,907
I'm gonna go check
on our doggy doc,

280
00:13:43,942 --> 00:13:45,841
make sure zadofian
got neutered.

281
00:13:53,301 --> 00:13:54,065
Dutch.

282
00:13:54,231 --> 00:13:55,755
Could you fill my box?

283
00:13:57,238 --> 00:13:58,826
Anything to help.

284
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:03,532
Packed tight.

285
00:14:05,426 --> 00:14:06,975
How come you got the unis
doing admin?

286
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,489
What would you prefer
they be doing?

287
00:14:08,524 --> 00:14:11,682
Had three people quit.
Downtown's hit us with a hiring freeze.

288
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:13,277
why?
We're already understaffed.

289
00:14:13,312 --> 00:14:14,357
Billings' lawsuit.

290
00:14:14,392 --> 00:14:16,592
You're kidding me!
The guy tapped his head on a desk.

291
00:14:16,627 --> 00:14:18,530
City attorney's gonna settle
with him today.

292
00:14:18,565 --> 00:14:21,213
They want him done and gone.
That means you'll be flying solo.

293
00:14:21,248 --> 00:14:24,393
The operative word being "fly."
Billings was a weight around my neck.

294
00:14:24,428 --> 00:14:27,538
I'm glad to see your partner's absence
hasn't dampened your humility.

295
00:14:36,006 --> 00:14:37,807
Dr. Lucine, I presume.

296
00:14:39,393 --> 00:14:40,856
Uh, I'm in the middle
of an exam.

297
00:14:40,891 --> 00:14:42,751
You're in the middle
of a whole lot more than that.

298
00:14:42,908 --> 00:14:46,049
I understand you're a Chief
surgeon at Armenia general.

299
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,849
I'm a veterinarian.

300
00:14:48,242 --> 00:14:51,909
So I check your pharmaceutical logs,
all I'm gonna find are doggy meds?

301
00:14:53,649 --> 00:14:56,798
I borrowed money from Armenian
loan sharks to pay for school.

302
00:14:56,833 --> 00:15:01,029
I didn't know patching up criminals
was gonna be part of my monthly payments.

303
00:15:01,064 --> 00:15:03,754
Did an Armenian come in here
with a belly wound?

304
00:15:06,065 --> 00:15:08,937
The bullet missed vital organs,
but he lost a lot of blood.

305
00:15:08,972 --> 00:15:09,971
Where is he now?

306
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:14,661
I stabilized him.
I drove him to the edgemont hotel -- second floor.

307
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,257
That's right.

308
00:15:29,292 --> 00:15:31,041
That's right.
You're doing good.

309
00:15:31,892 --> 00:15:34,738
I was gonna say "pussy gram,"
but that seemed a little obvious.

310
00:15:34,773 --> 00:15:35,500
What the hell is this?

311
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:38,486
I'll have her back before
that little blue pill wears off.

312
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:39,509
Come on let's go

313
00:15:40,252 --> 00:15:41,701
what the hell do you want?

314
00:15:41,736 --> 00:15:43,151
I'm looking for zadofian.

315
00:15:44,295 --> 00:15:47,393
Don't go blonde on me.
Rezian told me you're his main cooch.

316
00:15:47,428 --> 00:15:49,041
I haven't seen him.

317
00:15:49,158 --> 00:15:51,258
You want me to tell rezian
you were uncooperative?

318
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:53,606
Now, where does he stay
when he's in town?

319
00:15:55,184 --> 00:15:57,039
The edgemont hotel.

320
00:16:00,439 --> 00:16:01,348
Hey, Dutch.

321
00:16:01,383 --> 00:16:02,492
Do you have a minute?

322
00:16:03,058 --> 00:16:05,754
Um, let me go first.

323
00:16:05,996 --> 00:16:07,575
What happened last night --

324
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,930
We were both vulnerable, a little lonely.

325
00:16:09,965 --> 00:16:12,216
One-time thing
between good friends.

326
00:16:12,251 --> 00:16:15,461
No reason for us
to get all uncomfortable.

327
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:20,099
There's a guy here,
says he killed his wife.

328
00:16:21,805 --> 00:16:22,938
oh.

329
00:16:22,973 --> 00:16:24,477
Uh, okay.

330
00:16:26,324 --> 00:16:28,268
Well, I better --
I better get on that.

331
00:16:28,516 --> 00:16:30,913
Wouldn't want him to kill
anybody else's wife.

332
00:16:31,371 --> 00:16:32,592
Yeah.

333
00:16:34,547 --> 00:16:36,691
So, you killed your wife
two years ago.

334
00:16:36,726 --> 00:16:38,077
A little over
two years now.

335
00:16:38,345 --> 00:16:40,629
And no, I had
my friend hector kill her.

336
00:16:40,664 --> 00:16:42,862
I ground up some sleeping pills,
put it in her wine.

337
00:16:42,897 --> 00:16:44,604
She took a bath.
I went to work.

338
00:16:45,085 --> 00:16:48,903
Hector was supposed to push her down in the tub,
make it look like she got wasted and drowned.

339
00:16:48,938 --> 00:16:50,913
Douche bag
showed up too soon.

340
00:16:51,066 --> 00:16:52,057
She was awake.

341
00:16:52,092 --> 00:16:53,680
Had to force her head
underwater.

342
00:16:53,715 --> 00:16:55,440
That's how you guys
knew it was murder.

343
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,263
You were tried
and acquitted for the crime.

344
00:17:00,298 --> 00:17:03,309
And you can't arrest me now
'cause I'm protected by final jeopardy.

345
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:05,404
Right.

346
00:17:06,122 --> 00:17:09,090
Um, why not give up hector
at trial?

347
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,507
D.A. Had a shit case.
I knew I'd get off.

348
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:14,053
If I gave up hector then, he
would've told them I planned it.

349
00:17:14,088 --> 00:17:15,748
What was in it for hector?

350
00:17:15,783 --> 00:17:18,233
I fronted him the money to start
a vinyl siding business.

351
00:17:18,428 --> 00:17:20,639
So you and your buddy
killed your wife.

352
00:17:21,132 --> 00:17:23,605
You got no remorse
about that?

353
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,808
You had to know her.

354
00:17:25,854 --> 00:17:27,978
I just want hector
behind bars now.

355
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:30,068
Why the sudden interest
in justice?

356
00:17:30,103 --> 00:17:32,652
I never thought I'd want to get
married again, you know?

357
00:17:32,883 --> 00:17:33,980
Understandable.

358
00:17:34,577 --> 00:17:36,854
And then, bam --
I meet lorena.

359
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,972
Fall head over heels, man.

360
00:17:40,007 --> 00:17:41,384
Let me guess.

361
00:17:41,463 --> 00:17:43,298
Lorena's with hector.

362
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:44,938
She works
at his siding company.

363
00:17:45,352 --> 00:17:48,127
I know she loves me,
but she's afraid to leave him.

364
00:17:48,162 --> 00:17:49,988
Him being a murder
and all.

365
00:17:50,054 --> 00:17:51,220
Exactly.

366
00:17:56,607 --> 00:17:57,686
Zadofian?

367
00:17:58,088 --> 00:17:59,396
Room 11.

368
00:17:59,577 --> 00:18:01,705
Listen, I don't know
how this is gonna go.

369
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,812
You can take a pass.

370
00:18:03,421 --> 00:18:06,135
If shane's telling the truth,
this guy's a threat to all of us. I'm in.

371
00:18:08,311 --> 00:18:08,935
hey!

372
00:18:10,483 --> 00:18:11,361
Don't move!

373
00:18:15,691 --> 00:18:16,713
Who shot you?

374
00:18:16,748 --> 00:18:17,735
Screw you.

375
00:18:26,173 --> 00:18:26,927
Who?!

376
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:30,495
Had to be someone
working for rezian.

377
00:18:30,865 --> 00:18:31,826
Is that the guy?

378
00:18:33,465 --> 00:18:34,884
Yeah, that's him.
Who is he?

379
00:18:41,305 --> 00:18:43,057
You went after my family.

380
00:18:50,617 --> 00:18:51,789
God damn it.

381
00:18:51,824 --> 00:18:52,961
God damn it.

382
00:18:56,156 --> 00:18:56,289
Vic.

383
00:18:57,424 --> 00:18:57,857
Come on, Vic.

384
00:18:58,857 --> 00:18:59,551
Vic.

385
00:19:02,186 --> 00:19:03,742
Think about it, Vic.
Think about it.

386
00:19:03,777 --> 00:19:05,818
He was in Corrine's house.

387
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,860
His blood is on her floor.

388
00:19:07,892 --> 00:19:09,346
This is too messy.

389
00:19:49,011 --> 00:19:50,455
I'm just a soldier.

390
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,075
Don't know who or why.

391
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,722
We need to know
where to find diro.

392
00:19:55,832 --> 00:19:56,856
Page her.

393
00:19:59,484 --> 00:20:02,804
Claudette, emilio knows he can't
be retried for the murder,

394
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:06,124
gave me all the details about
how hector killed his wife.

395
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,252
See what hector
has to say.

396
00:20:07,287 --> 00:20:09,923
Actually, the original detective
on the case already did that.

397
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,432
Ruled him out
as a suspect.

398
00:20:12,225 --> 00:20:13,548
Detective Steve Billings.

399
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:15,838
See if he has
the strength to talk.

400
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,060
Hey, Vic!

401
00:20:17,151 --> 00:20:19,974
Julien's got a witness
for the body-dragging in one.

402
00:20:20,009 --> 00:20:21,146
Where's Gardocki?

403
00:20:21,181 --> 00:20:23,008
He's running down
a Salvadoran lead.

404
00:20:23,043 --> 00:20:24,270
Should be back soon.

405
00:20:24,442 --> 00:20:26,848
Whatever information
you give up could save lives.

406
00:20:26,883 --> 00:20:28,508
What, I look like
wonder woman to you?

407
00:20:28,848 --> 00:20:30,735
I'm wearing some sort
of magic bracelet

408
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:34,386
that's gonna deflect bullets
when people find out that I'm talking to you assholes?

409
00:20:36,294 --> 00:20:37,843
Here's another one now.

410
00:20:39,758 --> 00:20:41,347
Byz lat queen.

411
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:43,625
Who's the lucky cholo?

412
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,374
Jimmy mendez.

413
00:20:46,308 --> 00:20:47,240
Forget it.

414
00:20:47,275 --> 00:20:48,564
She'll never talk.

415
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:49,585
She can't.

416
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,395
The way the street's
been jumping off lately,

417
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:54,395
they even find out she was down here,
it'll be Jimmy they're dragging around.

418
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:57,360
Just because I got into a cop car
don't mean that I'm giving anything up.

419
00:20:57,395 --> 00:20:59,269
I hope you can convince them
of that.

420
00:20:59,539 --> 00:21:00,865
Sorry to trouble you.

421
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:06,734
Give her a minute.

422
00:21:10,266 --> 00:21:12,172
Anybody ever tumble
over this thing?

423
00:21:13,032 --> 00:21:14,799
Not without
a friendly push.

424
00:21:15,861 --> 00:21:18,011
Hey, choirboy,
that's for me.

425
00:21:19,459 --> 00:21:20,997
I'll take the stairs.

426
00:21:23,523 --> 00:21:24,868
Vic.

427
00:21:27,622 --> 00:21:28,924
If I, like,
remember something,

428
00:21:28,959 --> 00:21:31,547
can you make sure nothing
happens to Jimmy?

429
00:21:31,601 --> 00:21:34,328
I ain't doing
this baby shit by myself.

430
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,841
God damn it.

431
00:21:37,888 --> 00:21:40,736
No. No, my Salvadoran lead
didn't pan out.

432
00:21:41,153 --> 00:21:42,000
Vic back yet?

433
00:21:42,035 --> 00:21:45,372
Yeah, he and Julien are going at
a witness to the body-dragging.

434
00:21:45,407 --> 00:21:46,405
I got one more lead to run down.

435
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,858
I'll check back in.

436
00:21:57,874 --> 00:22:00,631
That's diro returning my call.

437
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:04,041
That diro's number?

438
00:22:04,076 --> 00:22:05,473
Yeah, that's her.

439
00:22:06,942 --> 00:22:08,108
Shouldn't I answer it?

440
00:22:08,143 --> 00:22:09,103
no.

441
00:22:09,138 --> 00:22:11,028
No, that's not necessary.

442
00:22:15,651 --> 00:22:17,050
Ah! Shit.

443
00:22:17,209 --> 00:22:18,711
Oh, shit.

444
00:23:09,101 --> 00:23:11,475
Oh. Oh, shit.

445
00:23:12,065 --> 00:23:13,758
Files on all
the Mexican federales

446
00:23:13,793 --> 00:23:15,958
kicked off the force
in the last five years.

447
00:23:15,993 --> 00:23:18,124
Cartel must have one hell
of a pension plan.

448
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:19,099
What's this?

449
00:23:19,134 --> 00:23:21,021
Death mob candidates.

450
00:23:21,056 --> 00:23:22,362
Ex-federales.

451
00:23:22,397 --> 00:23:24,386
Bounce it
off our witness.

452
00:23:24,421 --> 00:23:26,848
Maybe she can pick out
who's painting the streets.

453
00:23:26,883 --> 00:23:29,275
Captain, we got shots fired
at the edgemont hotel.

454
00:23:29,855 --> 00:23:32,416
Shit. That must be retaliation
for the draggings.

455
00:23:32,451 --> 00:23:33,802
Stay with Julien.

456
00:23:33,837 --> 00:23:34,856
Vendrell's in transit.

457
00:23:34,891 --> 00:23:36,394
I'll have him
check it out.

458
00:23:36,429 --> 00:23:38,065
Okay.

459
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:12,729
Somewhere
on the second floor.

460
00:24:18,263 --> 00:24:19,962
Holy Christ.

461
00:24:20,546 --> 00:24:21,825
Clear.

462
00:24:22,777 --> 00:24:25,732
1- tango-72,
we got a 187 at this location.

463
00:24:25,767 --> 00:24:26,731
Please advise.

464
00:24:26,766 --> 00:24:28,049
hey.

465
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:30,720
Holy shit,
you got here fast.

466
00:24:30,755 --> 00:24:32,344
Johnny on the spot.

467
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:34,036
Ouch.

468
00:24:34,071 --> 00:24:36,447
Footloose and fancy-free.

469
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:39,398
Those armenians sure do know how
to send a message, don't they?

470
00:24:39,433 --> 00:24:40,707
No shit.

471
00:24:50,298 --> 00:24:51,497
You okay?

472
00:24:52,661 --> 00:24:54,584
Shane was telling the truth
about zadofian

473
00:24:54,619 --> 00:24:55,960
going after your family.

474
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:57,344
Are you okay?

475
00:24:57,752 --> 00:25:00,568
Talked to Claudette, pulled the trigger
less than a minute later.

476
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:02,149
We're both covered.

477
00:25:02,184 --> 00:25:05,491
Hey, man.I need to see that
distant stare come off your face.

478
00:25:07,188 --> 00:25:08,546
I'm okay.

479
00:25:09,323 --> 00:25:10,479
Good.

480
00:25:10,514 --> 00:25:11,351
You get diro's number?

481
00:25:11,386 --> 00:25:13,784
Yeah. Time comes,
I can gps it in a heartbeat.

482
00:25:13,819 --> 00:25:15,184
Good.we'll shut down rezian first.

483
00:25:15,219 --> 00:25:18,371
As far as anyone knows, you were
following up on the Salvadorans.

484
00:25:18,406 --> 00:25:21,281
Vic, our witnessed I.D.'d
one of the federales.

485
00:25:21,316 --> 00:25:22,566
Our lucky day.

486
00:25:22,601 --> 00:25:23,817
We'll be right in.

487
00:25:28,625 --> 00:25:33,358
I got to go check on the great Brown
hope about keeping my badge.

488
00:25:33,506 --> 00:25:34,689
hey.

489
00:25:35,056 --> 00:25:38,183
You firing on enough cylinders
to handle this death mob thing?

490
00:25:38,218 --> 00:25:39,663
Yeah, I'm good.

491
00:25:43,822 --> 00:25:46,189
Hey. Those other
Salvadoran leads pan out?

492
00:25:46,717 --> 00:25:48,326
No.they were dead ends.

493
00:25:52,692 --> 00:25:54,237
What's with the cab?

494
00:25:54,272 --> 00:25:57,355
You know, ever since the injury,
I have these blackouts.

495
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:59,252
Makes driving too risky.

496
00:25:59,287 --> 00:26:01,659
I'm gonna need you
to reimburse me for this.

497
00:26:01,694 --> 00:26:03,823
Wyms said there's some insurance
papers I need to sign.

498
00:26:03,858 --> 00:26:05,705
Yeah. Thanks for coming down.

499
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,553
It's against
my better judgment.

500
00:26:07,964 --> 00:26:09,454
I'm supposed to avoid
the stress.

501
00:26:09,489 --> 00:26:10,910
While you're signing
the paperwork,

502
00:26:10,945 --> 00:26:13,193
there's some information I need
about a case you shared

503
00:26:13,228 --> 00:26:14,792
with the Barn
when you were at central.

504
00:26:14,827 --> 00:26:18,806
I'll try to help, but I've got these huge
memory gaps ever since the injury.

505
00:26:18,841 --> 00:26:22,021
Yeah.how is the bump on the head?

506
00:26:22,292 --> 00:26:25,862
The brain is the most mercurial
organ in the human body.

507
00:26:25,897 --> 00:26:27,317
Yes, it is.

508
00:26:27,793 --> 00:26:30,929
You remember
the doris borrego homicide?

509
00:26:33,607 --> 00:26:35,244
That was a while back.

510
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,201
What about it?

511
00:26:36,236 --> 00:26:39,485
The husband who was acquitted
came into the Barn today, confessed,

512
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,159
fingered his buddy
hector jimenez for the murder.

513
00:26:43,085 --> 00:26:44,528
The D.A. Tanked that case.

514
00:26:44,563 --> 00:26:45,607
It was a slam dunk.

515
00:26:45,642 --> 00:26:48,719
Insardi totally blew it --
You know,

516
00:26:48,754 --> 00:26:49,657
from what I can recall.

517
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:51,775
You remember
why you ruled out hector?

518
00:26:52,219 --> 00:26:53,265
who?

519
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,892
I'm gonna need you
to check your notes,

520
00:26:54,927 --> 00:26:56,795
see if anything
jars your memory.

521
00:26:57,962 --> 00:26:59,425
Maybe you should
call that cab back.

522
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,853
I'm getting
a little light-headed.

523
00:27:00,888 --> 00:27:03,700
Okay. I'm just trying to help
my partner here.

524
00:27:03,735 --> 00:27:05,988
But if the D.A. Pulls you
back into this,

525
00:27:06,023 --> 00:27:08,242
it might delay the progress
on your lawsuit.

526
00:27:09,733 --> 00:27:10,939
Right.

527
00:27:14,362 --> 00:27:16,408
Might need to make
a sushi run.

528
00:27:16,443 --> 00:27:19,210
Protein helps
with my memory capability.

529
00:27:19,662 --> 00:27:21,067
I'll get right on that.

530
00:27:30,534 --> 00:27:33,362
You and I have
the only two copies of the keys.

531
00:27:35,577 --> 00:27:36,493
What are you doing?

532
00:27:36,528 --> 00:27:39,367
There are over 100 blackmail
files in this box.

533
00:27:39,723 --> 00:27:42,178
I only need one of them
to get my badge back.

534
00:27:42,213 --> 00:27:44,633
You're gonna blackmail someone
just like Pezuela?

535
00:27:44,668 --> 00:27:48,024
No, I'm gonna give them
their sin back,

536
00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:49,615
grant them absolution.

537
00:27:49,833 --> 00:27:53,592
Him giving me my badge back is just
gonna b E his way of showing gratitude.

538
00:27:53,627 --> 00:27:56,022
Right now, this intel
is the only proof that

539
00:27:56,057 --> 00:27:57,159
we have that Pezuela's dirty.

540
00:27:57,194 --> 00:28:00,110
Using it as leverage
will compromise it as evidence.

541
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:02,233
Plus Pezuela will know
that you have the box.

542
00:28:02,268 --> 00:28:04,746
We can't risk
exposing that now.

543
00:28:04,781 --> 00:28:07,267
Now that your kodak moment
is out of this box,

544
00:28:07,302 --> 00:28:09,261
to hell with everyone else, right?

545
00:28:10,268 --> 00:28:11,964
You and me,
we're never gonna be friends.

546
00:28:11,999 --> 00:28:14,125
We both know that we're
just here for survival.

547
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,903
You want to be mayor.

548
00:28:15,938 --> 00:28:18,130
All I want to do is
keep being a cop.

549
00:28:18,165 --> 00:28:20,945
We can't use this information
to get your job back.

550
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:23,848
But we can begin to use it
to hurt Pezuela.

551
00:28:24,481 --> 00:28:27,005
Those body-dragging murders
you're investigating --

552
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,863
Pezuela sweeping away
the Salvadorans --

553
00:28:29,898 --> 00:28:30,915
What of it?

554
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:33,018
So he can build
his new hotel.

555
00:28:34,069 --> 00:28:36,680
There's a vote tomorrow night --
A major rezoning Bill.

556
00:28:37,081 --> 00:28:39,603
Councilman dowd
is chairman of the committee.

557
00:28:39,638 --> 00:28:41,111
Dowd's in the box.

558
00:28:41,146 --> 00:28:43,894
Pezuela's twisting his arm
so the vote will go his way.

559
00:28:45,536 --> 00:28:47,380
What if we made a copy
of the file

560
00:28:47,415 --> 00:28:50,055
for our case against Pezuela
and send dowd the original,

561
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:51,809
anonymously?

562
00:28:51,844 --> 00:28:53,529
Untwist his arm.

563
00:28:55,149 --> 00:28:57,304
Pezuela spent a lot of money.

564
00:28:57,828 --> 00:29:00,067
He shed a lot of blood
for that hotel.

565
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:03,837
He's gonna be pissed.

566
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,307
Pull the file.

567
00:29:13,902 --> 00:29:15,343
Any luck?

568
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:16,750
No, not yet.

569
00:29:16,785 --> 00:29:21,132
But I seem to vaguely recall
that hector had some kind of alibi.

570
00:29:21,167 --> 00:29:22,777
Maybe if you took off
the sunglasses,

571
00:29:22,812 --> 00:29:24,387
you could actually see
something.

572
00:29:24,422 --> 00:29:25,355
Doctor's orders.

573
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:27,738
Fluorescents exacerbate
my migraines.

574
00:29:30,709 --> 00:29:32,365
Oh, here it is.

575
00:29:36,199 --> 00:29:38,374
"lorena Francisco.

576
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:40,354
"all night.

577
00:29:40,389 --> 00:29:42,103
Great rack"?

578
00:29:42,138 --> 00:29:43,829
Well, this sounds
like your notes.

579
00:29:43,864 --> 00:29:46,054
She said she was with hector
the night of the murder,

580
00:29:46,089 --> 00:29:48,554
and I do recall
she had great tits.

581
00:29:48,589 --> 00:29:51,020
Billings, can I see you
in my office?

582
00:29:52,145 --> 00:29:54,534
I just got a call from
the city attorney's office,

583
00:29:54,634 --> 00:29:56,703
said your lawyer turned down
our settlement offer.

584
00:29:56,738 --> 00:29:58,676
I'm not at liberty
to discuss the case.

585
00:29:58,711 --> 00:30:00,615
That's what my bitch-dyke
lawyer is for.

586
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:02,215
It's bad enough criminals
sue us,

587
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:04,269
but cops filing
bogus suits?

588
00:30:04,304 --> 00:30:07,223
I was injured on the job,
and now I'm disabled.

589
00:30:07,365 --> 00:30:10,560
Do you know where
that payoff money comes from?

590
00:30:10,595 --> 00:30:13,755
Community programs, education,
gang intervention.

591
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:15,079
Well, you should have
thought about that

592
00:30:15,114 --> 00:30:17,587
before you let Mackey and
Kavanaugh run out of control.

593
00:30:17,622 --> 00:30:18,945
This is on you.

594
00:30:19,721 --> 00:30:21,061
Get out.

595
00:30:22,086 --> 00:30:23,688
Department must be
pretty desperate --

596
00:30:23,723 --> 00:30:25,240
You begging me to settle.

597
00:30:25,275 --> 00:30:27,199
Looks like I got the brass
by the balls,

598
00:30:27,234 --> 00:30:31,273
-and now it's squeezing time.
-yOu're a goddamn joke.

599
00:30:34,306 --> 00:30:36,379
I'll add slander
to my suit.

600
00:30:38,446 --> 00:30:41,642
Captain, witness turned up a match
from our ex-federales list.

601
00:30:41,677 --> 00:30:42,510
It's just in time.

602
00:30:42,545 --> 00:30:45,737
You remember a case a couple
years back -- doris borrego?

603
00:30:45,772 --> 00:30:46,683
We shared it with central?

604
00:30:46,718 --> 00:30:47,560
That's right.

605
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:49,837
Sure. It was my first dead body.bathtub.

606
00:30:49,872 --> 00:30:51,204
Did you testify
at that trial?

607
00:30:51,239 --> 00:30:52,248
Didn't do much good.

608
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:54,611
Defense ripped Billings'
police work to shreds.

609
00:30:54,646 --> 00:30:55,984
Insardi chewed him out.

610
00:30:56,019 --> 00:30:57,322
Half of downtown heard it.

611
00:30:57,357 --> 00:30:58,938
Yeah, thanks.

612
00:31:00,671 --> 00:31:02,879
According to Billings,
insardi was the one

613
00:31:02,914 --> 00:31:04,253
that tanked the case.

614
00:31:04,288 --> 00:31:06,407
Seems like it really got
under his skin.

615
00:31:07,326 --> 00:31:09,528
Maybe Steve
would be interested

616
00:31:09,563 --> 00:31:11,730
in a chance
to redeem himself.

617
00:31:12,277 --> 00:31:14,120
I'm all about
second chances.

618
00:31:14,737 --> 00:31:17,903
On our body-draggings, witness
I.D.'d Marcus villanueva --

619
00:31:17,938 --> 00:31:20,235
Thrown off the policia federal
two years ago.

620
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:22,637
Him and his partner accidentally
slit the throat of a suspect

621
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:23,722
during an interrogation.

622
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:25,284
On-the-job traing
for his next gig.

623
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:27,435
His brother owns
an army surplus store in Norman.

624
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:29,997
If he's there, he's probably
not alone or empty-handed.

625
00:31:30,032 --> 00:31:31,354
Strike team leads it.

626
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:33,806
I'll see if downtown can shake
loose a SWAT unit.

627
00:31:33,841 --> 00:31:35,010
I'll make sure that happens.

628
00:31:35,045 --> 00:31:38,335
Set up strategic on the 101
on-ramp near 59th and olive.

629
00:31:38,447 --> 00:31:39,514
You ready for this?

630
00:31:40,066 --> 00:31:41,271
Absolutely.

631
00:31:41,957 --> 00:31:44,336
Place is closed. They got
six cars parked out back.

632
00:31:44,371 --> 00:31:46,716
One of them's the pickup truck
our witness identified.

633
00:31:46,751 --> 00:31:49,164
We should move
while we got them contained.

634
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:51,577
These psychos get off
on collateral damage.

635
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,561
It's your call.

636
00:31:53,596 --> 00:31:56,580
SWAT's 15 minutes out. We'll wait.

637
00:31:56,835 --> 00:31:57,638
Where's Vic?

638
00:31:57,673 --> 00:31:59,292
He's trying to head off
the Salvadoran retaliation.

639
00:31:59,327 --> 00:32:00,608
He's on his way.

640
00:32:04,922 --> 00:32:07,166
Heard things didn't go so well
at your hearing.

641
00:32:07,386 --> 00:32:08,185
That's unfortunate.

642
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,923
Must've been a full moon.

643
00:32:10,343 --> 00:32:12,115
Bad night for everyone.

644
00:32:12,773 --> 00:32:14,903
A cartel death squad
used a couple of salvas

645
00:32:14,938 --> 00:32:17,555
to draw blood lines
down kearney.

646
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:21,188
You wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

647
00:32:22,276 --> 00:32:23,331
It's awful.

648
00:32:23,956 --> 00:32:27,555
Almost as awful as having
a former employee

649
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:30,087
sell off
your private files.

650
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,624
What files are those?

651
00:32:36,283 --> 00:32:40,284
Whatever they are,
they sure got the cesspool bubbling.

652
00:32:41,329 --> 00:32:46,043
R.o.c., Salvadorans, niners.
They're all bidding.

653
00:32:46,722 --> 00:32:50,105
The word is
the intel belonged to you.

654
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,192
What's your interest?

655
00:32:52,516 --> 00:32:56,552
Same as yours --
Get back what I lost.

656
00:32:57,351 --> 00:32:58,607
Your badge.

657
00:32:59,879 --> 00:33:02,509
Squeezing Aceveda
was a waste of time.

658
00:33:02,544 --> 00:33:03,333
He's a eunuch.

659
00:33:03,368 --> 00:33:07,792
My point --
You need someone with balls.

660
00:33:08,333 --> 00:33:12,485
I keep my badge, I got the
resources to be that guy.

661
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,764
Your dismissal
is already in motion.

662
00:33:20,903 --> 00:33:21,939
What?

663
00:33:21,974 --> 00:33:23,970
We got to move
on this death mob.

664
00:33:24,005 --> 00:33:26,192
Lost SWAT to some hostage thing
in south central.

665
00:33:26,227 --> 00:33:28,182
Really could use you
watching my back.

666
00:33:28,217 --> 00:33:30,138
All right. I'll call in for the 20.

667
00:33:33,084 --> 00:33:35,884
Not sure if I can help you,
detective.

668
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:38,373
Not sure
if I can help you either.

669
00:33:38,693 --> 00:33:40,840
Let's keep talking.

670
00:33:49,448 --> 00:33:52,377
We got movement at the shop --
One vehicle pulling out.

671
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:53,801
Pickup truck?

672
00:33:53,836 --> 00:33:54,952
No. Gray jeep.

673
00:33:55,277 --> 00:33:56,415
Get the plate number.

674
00:33:59,201 --> 00:34:00,884
We got to do this
without SWAT.

675
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:02,035
They're moving out.

676
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:03,151
Let's go! Let's go!

677
00:34:38,528 --> 00:34:40,475
Police!let me see your hands!

678
00:34:41,786 --> 00:34:42,707
Guns!

679
00:34:46,257 --> 00:34:47,884
We're pinned down!
Under fire!

680
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,583
Call Wilshire
for backup.

681
00:35:02,154 --> 00:35:03,724
Got an officer down.

682
00:35:03,736 --> 00:35:05,437
Three or four shooters.

683
00:35:07,779 --> 00:35:09,035
Okay.give me a radio.

684
00:35:10,102 --> 00:35:12,726
Ronnie,
I'm gonna create a diversion.

685
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:27,310
You.show me your hands.

686
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,127
Don't move.

687
00:35:30,939 --> 00:35:32,855
I thought you were gonna create
a diversion.

688
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:35,007
What, that's not
big enough for you?

689
00:35:35,765 --> 00:35:37,157
Everybody whole?

690
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:38,637
More or less.

691
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:41,987
Any idea how I should explain
this one to Phillips?

692
00:35:42,403 --> 00:35:45,435
He knows I've always had trouble
following directions.

693
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:47,778
Just tell him
I took a wrong turn.

694
00:35:48,154 --> 00:35:49,881
Come on. Let's go. Move.

695
00:35:58,122 --> 00:35:59,621
Hey, Danny, grab a couple of unis.

696
00:35:59,656 --> 00:36:01,418
We got to inventory
these illegal weapons.

697
00:36:01,453 --> 00:36:02,938
Good.more paperwork.

698
00:36:06,785 --> 00:36:08,061
Charger totaled?

699
00:36:08,481 --> 00:36:10,675
Nothing a good body man
can't make right.

700
00:36:13,351 --> 00:36:15,970
Look, your story
about zadofian panned out.

701
00:36:16,506 --> 00:36:17,526
Good.

702
00:36:17,561 --> 00:36:19,337
Heard the hit man took a hit.

703
00:36:19,372 --> 00:36:20,704
Nature of the job.

704
00:36:21,299 --> 00:36:22,869
I assume you had a chance
to chat with him

705
00:36:22,904 --> 00:36:24,191
before he took two
in the chest?

706
00:36:24,226 --> 00:36:25,541
Yeah, we did.

707
00:36:25,769 --> 00:36:27,317
Lucky for us.

708
00:36:28,247 --> 00:36:30,283
That eliminates
the immediate threat.

709
00:36:30,318 --> 00:36:31,719
Looks like
I'm gonna need you

710
00:36:31,754 --> 00:36:33,853
to get my family
clear of this thing.

711
00:36:33,888 --> 00:36:35,953
Well, then I'm here
for you, Vic.

712
00:36:37,281 --> 00:36:38,264
Yeah.

713
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:44,423
I got a plan on how to deal
with the rest of this problem,

714
00:36:44,458 --> 00:36:46,573
but I'll tell you
back at the Barn.

715
00:36:47,526 --> 00:36:49,839
I don't understand.
That trial is over.

716
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,152
Just closing out
some unfinished details.

717
00:36:52,187 --> 00:36:53,939
Do you know
hector jimenez?

718
00:36:55,726 --> 00:36:56,975
Sure.

719
00:36:57,833 --> 00:36:59,513
According to the detective
on the case,

720
00:36:59,548 --> 00:37:01,688
you were with him
on the night of the murder.

721
00:37:02,517 --> 00:37:04,080
When was the last time
you saw hector?

722
00:37:04,443 --> 00:37:06,014
This morning.

723
00:37:06,049 --> 00:37:07,550
He's my boss.

724
00:37:07,585 --> 00:37:10,453
And your fianc now, right?

725
00:37:10,833 --> 00:37:12,613
Yeah. So what?

726
00:37:12,648 --> 00:37:14,987
Do you know
emilio borrego?

727
00:37:15,771 --> 00:37:16,851
Yeah.

728
00:37:16,886 --> 00:37:19,358
-hE's a friend of hector's?
-hEllo.

729
00:37:19,659 --> 00:37:23,140
Glad to see your work ethic
has remained intact, detective.

730
00:37:23,175 --> 00:37:24,578
Insardi.what do you want?

731
00:37:24,613 --> 00:37:26,815
Wagenbach put in a request
to reopen this case.

732
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:27,861
I'm gonna see why.

733
00:37:27,896 --> 00:37:29,703
Guess you're sitting
this one out, huh?

734
00:37:29,738 --> 00:37:31,205
I'm on disability.

735
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:31,937
Oh, good.

736
00:37:31,972 --> 00:37:34,591
Maybe we'll actually
convict somebody.

737
00:37:36,551 --> 00:37:37,654
They're good friends.

738
00:37:37,689 --> 00:37:39,990
We need to spin that
fiction, make rezian believe

739
00:37:40,025 --> 00:37:43,544
the Mexicans are the armenians'
worst problem since the turks.

740
00:37:43,579 --> 00:37:45,913
I know just what lie
to tell him.

741
00:37:45,948 --> 00:37:47,193
Give us a minute.

742
00:37:57,636 --> 00:37:59,926
I just got off the phone
with Phillips.

743
00:38:00,847 --> 00:38:03,159
Save the touching
goodbye speech.

744
00:38:03,947 --> 00:38:06,771
The decision on your badge
has been pushed.

745
00:38:06,806 --> 00:38:09,705
Commissioner nebel has taken
an indefinite leave --

746
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:10,585
Health reasons --

747
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:16,179
And it will be at least 30 days before
they can assemble a new committee.

748
00:38:18,258 --> 00:38:21,582
I don't know what kind of voodoo
you're using

749
00:38:21,617 --> 00:38:24,150
or whose arm
you're twisting.

750
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:26,892
Just be grateful.

751
00:38:27,144 --> 00:38:30,034
You got another month of Mackey
to firm up your stats.

752
00:38:30,699 --> 00:38:33,762
Gardocki will be leading
this team.

753
00:38:34,494 --> 00:38:36,868
You start feeling
like you got nothing to lose,

754
00:38:36,903 --> 00:38:41,030
you act out in any way,
it'll be a black markin his jacket.

755
00:38:41,482 --> 00:38:43,494
You don't give a shit
about risking your future,

756
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:44,582
that's fine.

757
00:38:44,913 --> 00:38:47,238
Maybe you'll think twice
when it's your friend's.

758
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:50,805
Fewer and fewer of those friends
around these days.

759
00:38:58,867 --> 00:39:01,301
Lorena's sticking
to her story.

760
00:39:01,463 --> 00:39:03,676
Too scared
to tell the truth.

761
00:39:03,711 --> 00:39:06,195
Insardi's one smug bitch.

762
00:39:07,306 --> 00:39:09,361
Sure seems
to be gunning for you.

763
00:39:10,741 --> 00:39:12,013
Said I was incompetent,
right?

764
00:39:12,048 --> 00:39:14,597
Said something like
the only thing weaker

765
00:39:14,632 --> 00:39:17,147
than your detective skills
was your backbone.

766
00:39:22,533 --> 00:39:23,968
What? Don't worry about it.

767
00:39:24,003 --> 00:39:25,403
It's not your problem anymore.

768
00:39:28,523 --> 00:39:31,119
You work for hector's siding
company -- vice president of sales.

769
00:39:31,454 --> 00:39:32,189
yes.

770
00:39:32,224 --> 00:39:34,343
Two years ago you told me
hector was at your house

771
00:39:34,378 --> 00:39:36,463
eating Chinese food
the night doris was killed.

772
00:39:36,498 --> 00:39:37,894
I don't remember
all the details.

773
00:39:37,929 --> 00:39:39,576
You lied for hector,
gave him an alibi

774
00:39:39,611 --> 00:39:41,223
so he could go kill
emilio's wife.

775
00:39:41,258 --> 00:39:43,307
No. I was with him.

776
00:39:43,342 --> 00:39:45,493
-hE didn't do anything --
-bUllshit.

777
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:48,164
Emilio told us the whole story,
sweetheart.

778
00:39:48,199 --> 00:39:51,045
I know he's the one getting his joint
greased in big-titty heaven now.

779
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,378
Wants to marry you.

780
00:39:52,413 --> 00:39:55,168
Get hector out of the equation.

781
00:39:55,203 --> 00:39:57,495
I didn't --
That's not my fault.

782
00:39:57,530 --> 00:39:59,752
No, but you lying
for hector

783
00:39:59,787 --> 00:40:02,192
makes you and your twins
co-conspirators.

784
00:40:02,227 --> 00:40:05,529
And I'm sure those fat,
white guards in double-d block

785
00:40:05,564 --> 00:40:08,832
already have a come-stained cot
with your name on it.

786
00:40:09,311 --> 00:40:10,677
You got one chance
to save your ass --

787
00:40:10,712 --> 00:40:14,138
I didn't know about the killing
until afterwards.

788
00:40:14,691 --> 00:40:16,649
Swear to God.I'm sorry.

789
00:40:17,596 --> 00:40:19,024
I'm sorry.

790
00:40:20,464 --> 00:40:22,007
The last of the ak-47s.

791
00:40:22,042 --> 00:40:24,360
Get that area
behind me next.

792
00:40:50,852 --> 00:40:53,067
If I wanted to spend
my life doing inventory,

793
00:40:53,102 --> 00:40:55,283
I would have worked
for my uncle manny, you know?

794
00:40:58,955 --> 00:41:00,041
What happened?

795
00:41:02,296 --> 00:41:04,100
Turned my back for a second.

796
00:41:04,135 --> 00:41:06,055
Guy jumps out
from behind this crap.

797
00:41:06,552 --> 00:41:07,524
Took off.

798
00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:09,063
That guy could have been armed.

799
00:41:09,098 --> 00:41:10,567
Who the hell cleared this room?

800
00:41:11,391 --> 00:41:13,459
I- I'm not sure
who cleared it.

801
00:41:14,146 --> 00:41:15,522
Are you okay?

802
00:41:15,557 --> 00:41:16,899
Yeah, I'm fine.

803
00:41:18,548 --> 00:41:20,431
I'm just glad
nobody was hurt.

804
00:41:23,843 --> 00:41:26,310
If I find out
who failed to clear this room,

805
00:41:26,345 --> 00:41:28,109
somebody's out of a job.

806
00:41:30,542 --> 00:41:32,329
Steve, come on in.
Sit down.

807
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:36,080
First, I want to apologize
for that outburst earlier.

808
00:41:36,115 --> 00:41:37,358
It was unprofessional.

809
00:41:37,393 --> 00:41:38,774
Yeah,
and very mean-spirited.

810
00:41:38,809 --> 00:41:41,743
Second, I want to thank you
for solving that murder for us.

811
00:41:41,778 --> 00:41:43,735
It will really help
with our quarterly stats.

812
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:45,891
You were on the top
of your game.

813
00:41:45,926 --> 00:41:48,299
Yeah, I get these little bursts
of energy,

814
00:41:48,334 --> 00:41:50,783
you know, in between needing
to lie down and so forth.

815
00:41:50,818 --> 00:41:52,156
Well, don't be modest,
Steve.

816
00:41:52,191 --> 00:41:54,728
You work for hector's
siding company --vice president of sales

817
00:41:54,763 --> 00:41:57,647
headaches, disorientation,
lethargy,

818
00:41:57,682 --> 00:42:00,531
memory loss,
inability to logic.

819
00:42:00,783 --> 00:42:02,143
What's your point?

820
00:42:02,178 --> 00:42:03,468
Your scam's over.

821
00:42:03,503 --> 00:42:05,814
We've got proof you've been
faking your head injury.

822
00:42:05,849 --> 00:42:07,003
This doesn't prove shit.

823
00:42:07,038 --> 00:42:10,024
With the tape and our testimony
from your performance today,

824
00:42:10,059 --> 00:42:11,261
your lawsuit is dead.

825
00:42:11,296 --> 00:42:13,335
Maybe we throw in your history
of defrauding the city

826
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:16,626
with your little
vending machine enterprise.

827
00:42:17,668 --> 00:42:18,726
All right. Look.

828
00:42:19,093 --> 00:42:21,993
Last thing I ever wanted to do
was hurt the department.

829
00:42:22,028 --> 00:42:24,185
I will call my attorney and have
her take the settlement offer.

830
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:25,391
You'll take nothing.

831
00:42:25,426 --> 00:42:27,912
You'll be glad I didn't
fire you, pull your pension.

832
00:42:27,947 --> 00:42:29,126
I spoke to Phillips.

833
00:42:29,131 --> 00:42:31,306
You'll be back to work
tomorrow morning.

834
00:42:31,341 --> 00:42:33,481
If you want to quit,
it's up to you.

835
00:42:35,756 --> 00:42:37,684
I'll have to consult
with my legal team.

836
00:42:37,719 --> 00:42:40,055
Just as long as you're here
tomorrow morning first thing,

837
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:42,522
you can consult
till your hair grows back.

838
00:42:43,217 --> 00:42:44,693
What are you doing, cass?

839
00:42:45,013 --> 00:42:47,693
That s.u.V.'s been sitting
down the block all day.

840
00:42:47,728 --> 00:42:49,792
It's just a neighbor,
sweetie.

841
00:43:04,869 --> 00:43:05,806
Pack your stuff, kids.

842
00:43:05,841 --> 00:43:07,314
We're going home.

843
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:11,541
My lesbo lawyer says I'm
required to return to work --

844
00:43:11,576 --> 00:43:13,933
Make myself available
to render services.

845
00:43:14,395 --> 00:43:16,227
Well, it's good
to have you back, Steve.

846
00:43:16,262 --> 00:43:17,667
Yeah, I'll be back,
all right --

847
00:43:18,008 --> 00:43:21,441
Putting in my required hours,
mandatory paperwork.

848
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:25,088
But as far as effort goes,
I don't know what's between zero

849
00:43:25,123 --> 00:43:27,538
and the city mandate minimum,
but from now on,

850
00:43:27,573 --> 00:43:30,511
let's just call that the Billings.

851
00:43:30,546 --> 00:43:33,094
Can't we just call it
business as usual?

852
00:43:34,117 --> 00:43:37,561
Here's the blood-test report
from Mackey's ex-wife's house.

853
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:41,254
This matches Ari zadofian,

854
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,990
the Armenian we found dead in the hotel today.

855
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:47,361
Where were Vic and his guys
when this went down?

856
00:43:47,396 --> 00:43:48,313
Vic was here with me.

857
00:43:48,348 --> 00:43:50,831
The rest of his guys
were running down leads.

858
00:43:50,866 --> 00:43:52,255
Strike team seems clear
on this one.

859
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:53,844
Of course they do.

860
00:43:56,123 --> 00:43:57,430
How you holding up?

861
00:43:58,826 --> 00:44:01,315
I'm struggling.
New medication.

862
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:02,571
Well, you're doing great.

863
00:44:02,919 --> 00:44:05,103
If you need anything,
let me know.

864
00:44:10,797 --> 00:44:12,181
I found zadofian.

865
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:13,357
You turn him over
to my guys?

866
00:44:13,392 --> 00:44:15,927
Not unless your guys work
for the county coroner.

867
00:44:15,962 --> 00:44:17,121
He's dead.

868
00:44:18,788 --> 00:44:21,708
The first thing I ask you to do
turns to shit.

869
00:44:21,743 --> 00:44:26,291
What's turned to shit is your
control over little Armenia.

870
00:44:26,766 --> 00:44:28,563
I found zadofian...

871
00:44:28,598 --> 00:44:31,357
With two bullets to the chest
and his feet chopped off --

872
00:44:31,392 --> 00:44:33,274
Old-school retribution.

873
00:44:33,309 --> 00:44:35,111
That was diro
sending you a message.

874
00:44:35,146 --> 00:44:36,616
She has no power anymore.

875
00:44:36,651 --> 00:44:38,086
She's reaching out...

876
00:44:38,694 --> 00:44:40,501
To the Mexicans.

877
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,932
The word on the street
is she's forming an alliance.

878
00:44:46,887 --> 00:44:48,633
We've never trusted
the wetbacks.

879
00:44:48,668 --> 00:44:50,061
Well, this is L.A., baby.

880
00:44:50,096 --> 00:44:53,016
It's latino land, and she sees
the writing on the wall.

881
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:59,023
I know every Mexican gang
from here to sinaloa,

882
00:44:59,058 --> 00:45:02,026
which means that nothing happens
to Vic's family

883
00:45:02,061 --> 00:45:04,304
or you lose the only guy
who can stop diro

884
00:45:04,339 --> 00:45:06,328
and her Mexican threat.

885
00:45:12,782 --> 00:45:16,205
I hope commissioner nebel's
health problem isn't too serious.

886
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,509
Nothing three weeks
in the caribbean

887
00:45:17,544 --> 00:45:19,628
with his mistress
can't cure.

888
00:45:20,456 --> 00:45:23,465
Gives me 30 days
to evaluate your effectiveness,

889
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:27,403
see if your stay of execution
should become permanent.

890
00:45:30,172 --> 00:45:32,804
Found out the name
of one of your former employees

891
00:45:32,839 --> 00:45:34,607
who were stealing secrets.

892
00:45:35,449 --> 00:45:36,910
Aramboles.

893
00:45:38,388 --> 00:45:39,949
What about the files?

894
00:45:39,984 --> 00:45:41,475
He sold them to rezian.

895
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:45,309
Whatever's in that box
is giving him big balls.

896
00:45:46,064 --> 00:45:50,163
The armenians are making a hard
play for your barrio sandbox.

897
00:45:50,504 --> 00:45:54,186
And while you're judging
my effectiveness,

898
00:45:54,221 --> 00:45:56,638
you just keep something
in mind --

899
00:45:56,673 --> 00:45:59,020
There's no other cop
in this town

900
00:45:59,055 --> 00:46:02,659
who knows those balkan psychos
better than I do.

901
00:46:06,901 --> 00:46:07,798
Yeah?

902
00:46:07,833 --> 00:46:09,488
Corrine and Cassidy
left a few minutes ago.

903
00:46:09,523 --> 00:46:11,136
I think she recognized me.

904
00:46:11,171 --> 00:46:12,356
Oh, shit.

905
00:46:12,391 --> 00:46:14,455
All right. Keep on them.

906
00:46:23,396 --> 00:46:25,273
-sHane here?
-nO.

907
00:46:28,532 --> 00:46:29,818
What do you want
with him?

908
00:46:29,853 --> 00:46:30,999
The truth.

909
00:46:31,034 --> 00:46:32,721
I know what shane did
to you.

910
00:46:32,756 --> 00:46:34,455
Oh, so he told you.

911
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:35,627
-hE told you --
-hE had to.

912
00:46:35,674 --> 00:46:38,146
Vic came here last night
and did the same thing to me --

913
00:46:38,181 --> 00:46:39,344
Payback.

914
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:40,473
Vic? No.

915
00:46:40,508 --> 00:46:42,764
He didn't know about
the bogus Armenian threat.

916
00:46:42,799 --> 00:46:44,574
He thought shane
was trying to hurt him

917
00:46:44,609 --> 00:46:46,478
by scaring you
and your daughter.

918
00:46:46,513 --> 00:46:47,874
What Armenian threat?

919
00:46:47,909 --> 00:46:49,995
Shane was acting out
on some bullshit tip

920
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:51,970
for some banger in county.

921
00:46:52,382 --> 00:46:54,782
I guess one of us
is being lied to.

922
00:46:56,265 --> 00:47:00,536
Listen, Vic's had this ex-cop
watching us all day long, okay?

923
00:47:00,891 --> 00:47:03,416
And I don't know what's going on
between --

924
00:47:03,451 --> 00:47:05,941
I do, and it's hurting
both our families.

925
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:08,543
Now, if our husbands
won't stay away from each other,

926
00:47:08,578 --> 00:47:11,497
then maybe we need to step in
so that...

927
00:47:12,118 --> 00:47:13,837
So that somebody
doesn't get hurt.

928
00:47:20,684 --> 00:47:22,263
Cassidy?

929
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:29,169
Zadofian's prelim
crime-scene report.

930
00:47:29,204 --> 00:47:30,300
Holy shit.

931
00:47:30,335 --> 00:47:32,164
His shoes were attached
when I left him.

932
00:47:32,708 --> 00:47:34,936
Guess who the first detective
on the scene was.

933
00:47:34,971 --> 00:47:36,403
I know. Shane.

934
00:47:39,843 --> 00:47:42,432
Rezian must have sent him
looking for zadofian.

935
00:47:43,009 --> 00:47:45,846
The feet were some kind
of message to diro.

936
00:47:46,273 --> 00:47:47,516
There he is.

937
00:47:48,546 --> 00:47:51,022
Shane is neck-deep
in Armenian shit.

938
00:47:52,748 --> 00:47:55,691
Listen,
we got to keep him close,

939
00:47:55,916 --> 00:47:58,485
make him feel safe,
just like old times,

940
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:01,447
as soon as we get this situation
under control.

941
00:48:05,202 --> 00:48:07,621
What you did for me today,
I'll never forget.

942
00:48:10,652 --> 00:48:12,428
I thought pulling the trigger
would be the hard part --

943
00:48:12,463 --> 00:48:17,194
Don't you ever get sucked into
that black hole that got shane.

944
00:48:21,949 --> 00:48:25,281
You got any idea how zadofian
got that pedicure?

945
00:48:26,723 --> 00:48:28,475
It was like that
when I got on the scene.

946
00:48:29,605 --> 00:48:30,642
why?

947
00:48:31,061 --> 00:48:33,079
It's just he had both
of his feet

948
00:48:33,114 --> 00:48:35,097
when we got done
talking to him.

949
00:48:39,626 --> 00:48:43,561
Look, rezian wanted me to find
zadofian before the cops did,

950
00:48:43,596 --> 00:48:45,576
turn him over
to his guys.

951
00:48:46,677 --> 00:48:51,008
I chopped off the feet to make
it look like diro's handiwork.

952
00:48:51,787 --> 00:48:53,470
No idea who shot him.

953
00:48:54,094 --> 00:48:55,429
you?

954
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:58,588
Probably was diro.

955
00:49:00,450 --> 00:49:01,602
Right.

956
00:49:03,486 --> 00:49:05,289
Well, either way,
it helped sell the story.

957
00:49:05,677 --> 00:49:09,807
Told rezian that diro's made
some new greasy friends.

958
00:49:10,424 --> 00:49:11,424
Did like you said.

959
00:49:11,459 --> 00:49:14,153
Convinced him that the Mexicans
were his biggest threat.

960
00:49:14,188 --> 00:49:15,173
Good.

961
00:49:15,208 --> 00:49:17,482
I got the Mexicans thinking
that the armenians

962
00:49:17,517 --> 00:49:20,489
are making a power play
for the barrio.

963
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:22,937
And we help
both sides win.

964
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,107
Could get real bloody
real fast.

965
00:49:26,646 --> 00:49:29,881
The sooner they bleed out,
the sooner my family's safe.

966
00:49:32,397 --> 00:49:33,697
So...

967
00:49:35,061 --> 00:49:36,463
What now?

968
00:49:37,592 --> 00:49:39,247
We just sit back...

969
00:49:40,962 --> 00:49:42,758
...watch the gang war.

970
00:49:45,262 --> 00:49:49,814
