1
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,840
He's representing a company that has backing
of various mexican investment interests.

2
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,629
The mexican mob is buying up farmington?

3
00:00:32,664 --> 00:00:34,708
- Blackmail
- That's how Pezuela's getting everyone onboard.

4
00:00:36,209 --> 00:00:37,867
Do you want to give me a
clue what all this is about?

5
00:00:37,902 --> 00:00:41,505
The intel box the mexis are using
to blackmail their way up to the top.

6
00:00:41,539 --> 00:00:43,107
You made it look like it
was sold out to the armos.

7
00:00:43,242 --> 00:00:48,162
Which lit the fuse for the blood feud we're
stirring up between Rezian and the mexicans.

8
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,179
Nicely done.

9
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,123
Where's that blackmail box?

10
00:00:51,124 --> 00:00:54,360
Aceveda: you couldn't resist the
temptation to use it for your own purposes.

11
00:00:54,361 --> 00:00:57,988
I am now in possession of the box until the
time is right to turn it over to justice.

12
00:00:58,155 --> 00:00:58,864
What about the files?

13
00:00:58,865 --> 00:01:01,101
Whatever's in that box is
giving Rezian big balls.

14
00:01:01,268 --> 00:01:04,870
He's taken something that belongs to me.

15
00:01:04,905 --> 00:01:07,640
I took your money-Train cash. I'm not
afraid to come here and tell you about it.

16
00:01:07,641 --> 00:01:10,934
Instead of the $2 million that I don't
have, I'm gonna grant you three wishes.

17
00:01:10,935 --> 00:01:16,557
Once you've had your three meals, we walk
away from the table fat, happy, and even.

18
00:01:16,617 --> 00:01:21,711
I'm sick of walking around half the day
smiling at a guy who put a grenade in Lem's lap.

19
00:01:21,712 --> 00:01:23,078
We need Shane right now.

20
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:25,057
We're gonna make him feel safe.

21
00:01:25,158 --> 00:01:27,601
We're gonna get through this,
come through the other side.

22
00:01:27,936 --> 00:01:28,895
Thank you.

23
00:01:32,096 --> 00:01:35,301
Never mind the illegal drinking. You were
supposed to be watching your brother matthew.

24
00:01:35,468 --> 00:01:37,469
He's your responsibility, not mine.

25
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,137
Who the hell do you
think you're talking to?!

26
00:01:39,138 --> 00:01:42,899
The only parent that's
ever around to listen to me.

27
00:01:43,066 --> 00:01:48,855
Don't you ever push your mother
like that! Do you understand?!

28
00:01:52,075 --> 00:01:53,074
Hi.

29
00:01:53,075 --> 00:01:55,542
Uh, I need to talk to cass.

30
00:01:55,545 --> 00:01:57,488
I'm sorry things got
out of control before.

31
00:01:57,489 --> 00:02:01,226
We're already running late for school.

32
00:02:01,393 --> 00:02:03,828
I already grounded her. She's furious.

33
00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:06,738
You know what, this may not
be the best time to talk.

34
00:02:08,356 --> 00:02:09,606
Please, Corrine.

35
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,279
It's the time I have.

36
00:02:14,931 --> 00:02:16,131
Okay, come on.

37
00:02:19,694 --> 00:02:20,770
Cassidy?

38
00:02:20,805 --> 00:02:22,255
Your father's here.

39
00:02:25,107 --> 00:02:26,657
Open the door, please.

40
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:29,247
Cass?

41
00:02:33,248 --> 00:02:36,360
Listen, kid. I apologize
for losing my temper.

42
00:02:37,561 --> 00:02:40,674
I grabbed you way harder
than intended, and I'm sorry.

43
00:02:45,126 --> 00:02:46,315
Do you hear me?

44
00:02:46,316 --> 00:02:47,260
Fine.

45
00:02:49,261 --> 00:02:53,233
All right, now, for your part, I think
you owe your mother and I an explanation.

46
00:02:53,234 --> 00:02:57,320
We trusted you with
certain responsibilities.

47
00:02:57,357 --> 00:02:58,407
You let us down.

48
00:03:01,774 --> 00:03:03,419
Hey! We're talking to you.

49
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,120
Apology accepted.

50
00:03:06,448 --> 00:03:07,448
I'm ready to go.

51
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:09,965
We'll finish this later.

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,721
You made a big mistake. It could have
had some goddamn serious consequences.

53
00:03:13,888 --> 00:03:14,687
Please don't swear.

54
00:03:14,688 --> 00:03:16,364
I apologized, and now I'm waiting

55
00:03:16,399 --> 00:03:19,226
To hear an explanation
about your behavior.

56
00:03:19,227 --> 00:03:21,527
How do you explain your behavior?

57
00:03:21,528 --> 00:03:24,073
I don't have to explain myself.

58
00:03:24,074 --> 00:03:26,480
All the investigations.
You're the criminal.

59
00:03:26,515 --> 00:03:27,702
I'm your father!

60
00:03:27,703 --> 00:03:29,445
Your choice, not mine.

61
00:03:29,446 --> 00:03:34,356
Hey, I'm gonna be your father whether
you like what I teach you or not!

62
00:03:34,594 --> 00:03:37,644
Let's go. Come on.

63
00:03:37,811 --> 00:03:39,261
Let's go. Let's go.

64
00:03:39,313 --> 00:03:40,313
God damn it.

65
00:03:40,348 --> 00:03:41,148
Hello!

66
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:48,765
Rezian's safe house.

67
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,765
I see that.

68
00:03:49,766 --> 00:03:51,391
It went up in smoke early this morning
- Two bodies.

69
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:53,348
Rezian?

70
00:03:53,383 --> 00:03:54,661
Both too crispy to I.D.

71
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,871
I'm guessing it's Pezuela's boys
hunting for the blackmail box.

72
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,842
Means they're still convinced
the armenians have their intel.

73
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:04,077
If that is Rezian laying in there,

74
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:06,306
That's one more name off the list of
armos that know about our money-Train debt.

75
00:04:06,873 --> 00:04:08,250
Our deal was with Rezian.

76
00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:11,698
Him being dead might put
us back to square one.

77
00:04:17,964 --> 00:04:19,193
Mmm, s'mores.

78
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:21,896
The arson unit weigh in yet?

79
00:04:21,897 --> 00:04:25,723
It didn't have to. The killers left gasoline
cans behind. Weren't even trying to hide it.

80
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:28,426
Recovered 9mm shells,
bullet holes in their skulls.

81
00:04:28,427 --> 00:04:31,806
Today's the city march
observing the armenian genocide.

82
00:04:31,807 --> 00:04:34,615
The block's in the middle of
a red, blue, and orange sea

83
00:04:34,676 --> 00:04:37,035
Whole area's gonna be
swarming with people.

84
00:04:38,536 --> 00:04:41,136
Strange day for an internal beef.

85
00:04:41,138 --> 00:04:43,917
The armenians make any recent enemies?

86
00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:46,877
I heard some talk the mexicans have
been stirring things up with them.

87
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:48,589
Could just be street chatter.

88
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,180
If this is the first shot in a war,

89
00:04:50,181 --> 00:04:53,660
I don't want the armenian day of
remembrance being turned into a fresh battle.

90
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:58,722
Well, maybe Shane's playdates with
Ellis Rezian can pay off again.

91
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:00,557
We'll track him down, get
him to I.D. The bodies.

92
00:05:00,558 --> 00:05:02,270
See you guys back at the barn.

93
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:06,262
Rezian gone might not
be the worst thing.

94
00:05:06,263 --> 00:05:09,042
Cut off the head, and the
tentacles get frisky. It's a risk.

95
00:05:09,043 --> 00:05:09,742
Look, just hear me out.

96
00:05:09,777 --> 00:05:11,606
Let's find out if he's
alive first, all right?

97
00:05:18,358 --> 00:05:19,652
It's okay.

98
00:05:19,726 --> 00:05:21,122
Glad to see you upright.

99
00:05:23,789 --> 00:05:25,280
If I hadn't gotten out
of there last night -

100
00:05:25,531 --> 00:05:26,625
Don't worry. You already thanked me.

101
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,195
Two of my lieutenants are
dead. And this was the mexicans?

102
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:33,225
They couldn't kill you in jail. Why did
you think they would stop on the outside?

103
00:05:33,392 --> 00:05:34,601
What do they want?

104
00:05:37,502 --> 00:05:42,174
Some mexican intel went missing. Whatever it
was, it was valuable enough to spark a war.

105
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,702
Your two burned lieutenants
will vouch for that.

106
00:05:45,069 --> 00:05:49,088
If you've heard the rumors, you
can find their source, right?

107
00:05:50,205 --> 00:05:54,927
I want a sit-Down with the people
who burned my store and killed my men.

108
00:05:55,462 --> 00:05:58,398
My people are dead because
the mexicans are wrong.

109
00:05:58,815 --> 00:06:01,517
I'll talk to them, make
them understand that.

110
00:06:01,518 --> 00:06:06,330
They shanked you. They killed your guys. Now
you want to pencil in some kind of circle jerk?

111
00:06:06,331 --> 00:06:08,957
The only way to respond is to push back.

112
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:12,292
The mexicans are too powerful. We
can't compete against their numbers.

113
00:06:12,837 --> 00:06:16,839
You think them realizing the armos don't have
the balls to fight back is gonna lead to peace?

114
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,317
The mexicans will smell your weakness,

115
00:06:19,536 --> 00:06:20,469
And they'll pounce on it.

116
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:23,172
We don't have their missing intel.

117
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:26,345
When they know that, they'll go
looking for it someplace else.

118
00:06:32,262 --> 00:06:37,327
If I pull this off, it's number
two on your short list of favors.

119
00:06:37,494 --> 00:06:39,488
One more, me and my
family are all paid up.

120
00:06:40,155 --> 00:06:44,037
As long as the meeting happens before
any more armenian blood is shed.

121
00:06:47,704 --> 00:06:49,707
It's time to end this war we started.

122
00:06:50,098 --> 00:06:52,606
Can't do that yet. We got the
list of Rezian's inner circle,

123
00:06:52,641 --> 00:06:54,168
Which just grew smaller by two.

124
00:06:54,669 --> 00:07:03,977
That's time to finish this job while
we can still control the casualties.

125
00:07:04,978 --> 00:07:07,549
Look, I know that you are not
thinking about setting up this meeting.

126
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,983
I'm thinking about
setting up this meetin

127
00:07:10,484 --> 00:07:13,532
Is this another one of those surprise endings that
you're gonna lay on me after all this is over with?

128
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:17,534
Rezian isn't the only one we
have to think about taking down.

129
00:07:19,535 --> 00:07:21,562
I'm
- I'm targeting cruz Pezuela.

130
00:07:22,063 --> 00:07:24,064
Aceveda's one-Man campaign bankroll?

131
00:07:24,175 --> 00:07:26,801
He's buying up farmington
with cartel money.

132
00:07:26,802 --> 00:07:30,837
Pezuela gets his way, the entire district
will be Byz Lat-Owned and -Operated.

133
00:07:31,304 --> 00:07:33,030
Well, how is that our problem?

134
00:07:39,155 --> 00:07:41,657
It's big-Picture time, Matt.

135
00:07:41,658 --> 00:07:43,715
They're trying to take my
badge, and I need an endgame.

136
00:07:44,161 --> 00:07:46,652
Pezuela is the cherry
on my career sundae.

137
00:07:46,653 --> 00:07:48,531
Why does that have to involve Rezian?

138
00:07:48,532 --> 00:07:50,434
The only way to connect
Pezuela to the cartel

139
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:52,336
Is to force him into
making a bad mistake.

140
00:07:54,503 --> 00:07:58,214
The intel in that box belongs to him.

141
00:07:59,774 --> 00:08:02,011
Now, if Pezuela gets desperate
enough to get it back,

142
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:05,204
He shoots his way into
a jail cell and wipes out

143
00:08:05,473 --> 00:08:08,608
The armenian threat for us
- Two for one.

144
00:08:09,109 --> 00:08:14,196
What happens when Pezuela doesn't cooperate
and we're forced to choose one win?

145
00:08:14,783 --> 00:08:15,983
Not there yet.

146
00:08:26,814 --> 00:08:29,248
Rezian wants to sit down
with the mexican brains.

147
00:08:29,415 --> 00:08:31,282
Guess he got your smoke signals.

148
00:08:31,783 --> 00:08:33,728
And he's willing to make a deal.

149
00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:36,823
I'm not paying anyone to
give me back my property.

150
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,132
I'm paying you to get it.

151
00:08:38,533 --> 00:08:41,550
I'm giving you a chance
to get your blackmail box.

152
00:08:41,585 --> 00:08:43,562
That's what you're paying me for.

153
00:08:43,563 --> 00:08:44,439
That doesn't interest you,

154
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,064
I'm sure Rezian will be
content to hold onto it,

155
00:08:47,065 --> 00:08:48,509
Do with it as he sees fit.

156
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:52,670
Or you could try to burn your way
through the rest of east hollywood.

157
00:08:54,671 --> 00:08:56,575
This might be the smarter move.

158
00:08:56,742 --> 00:08:57,951
I'll set it up.

159
00:08:58,252 --> 00:09:00,653
But they want to talk to the brains.

160
00:09:00,688 --> 00:09:03,656
I am not walking into the
belly of the armenian beast

161
00:09:03,657 --> 00:09:05,653
With one of your day
laborers as my date.

162
00:09:08,154 --> 00:09:09,354
Okay.

163
00:09:11,966 --> 00:09:13,166
Hoy más tarde te llamo.

164
00:09:13,234 --> 00:09:14,584
Detective Mackey,

165
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:16,269
Amando Rios.

166
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,705
Amando will speak for me.

167
00:09:19,706 --> 00:09:21,006
Not sure he'll pass for brains.

168
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:25,135
He's less tequila-Soaked than the rest
of the crew I've seen circling you lately.

169
00:09:25,136 --> 00:09:26,279
There's only one condition.

170
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:31,541
If they don't bring the box to this meeting,
every file, tell them not to come at all.

171
00:09:31,676 --> 00:09:32,693
Fair enough.

172
00:09:32,694 --> 00:09:33,443
What meeting?

173
00:09:33,444 --> 00:09:34,553
I'll explain it all

174
00:09:34,588 --> 00:09:37,851
As soon as detective Mackey
gets back to us with the details.

175
00:09:40,518 --> 00:09:42,085
Rios isn't just some beaner.

176
00:09:42,086 --> 00:09:44,403
He's got a face only
a cartel could love.

177
00:09:44,521 --> 00:09:47,140
I got Julien looking into him now.

178
00:09:47,307 --> 00:09:48,300
What do I tell Rezian?

179
00:09:48,301 --> 00:09:49,125
Tell him the truth.

180
00:09:49,126 --> 00:09:52,728
Pezuela's not sending his boy unless
he knows the blackmail box is waiting.

181
00:09:52,739 --> 00:09:54,907
So, the meet-And-Greet
doesn't even happen.

182
00:09:54,908 --> 00:09:57,075
We look like we did
our job for both sides.

183
00:09:57,076 --> 00:09:58,856
They stay clueless and at war.

184
00:09:59,145 --> 00:10:03,105
According to the computer, Amando Rios
is a nonperson, at least stateside.

185
00:10:03,106 --> 00:10:05,007
He's one of the arsonists?

186
00:10:05,008 --> 00:10:06,284
Well, it's possible.

187
00:10:06,685 --> 00:10:10,679
Tipster thinks he might be
hooked up with a mexican cartel.

188
00:10:10,714 --> 00:10:12,347
That's a world bigger than
what our database covers.

189
00:10:12,348 --> 00:10:14,459
Then you might need
to dig a little deeper.

190
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,204
Well, I'll try and find a bigger shovel.

191
00:10:19,764 --> 00:10:22,034
You got to love that first-Year
strike team enthusiasm.

192
00:10:23,601 --> 00:10:25,870
Keep an eye on Julien
- Information we need -

193
00:10:26,971 --> 00:10:29,239
But if Rios gets picked up or spooked,

194
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,640
We lose our best shot at Pezuela.

195
00:10:30,675 --> 00:10:32,400
There shouldn't be any
trace of his location

196
00:10:32,401 --> 00:10:35,286
Under any rocks that Julien can reach.

197
00:10:39,593 --> 00:10:40,793
Hey, you called me.

198
00:10:41,853 --> 00:10:43,654
I don't need anyone mixing martinis,

199
00:10:43,655 --> 00:10:46,565
But I'd like a little credit
for braving the morning gridlock.

200
00:10:47,732 --> 00:10:50,019
Ah, give us a minute.

201
00:10:50,186 --> 00:10:50,852
Thanks for coming.

202
00:10:50,853 --> 00:10:54,199
You sounded like you need a
favor. And you're more than due.

203
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,295
We drew the short straw on this morning's
burning deaths in little armenia.

204
00:11:00,896 --> 00:11:03,531
You're the one with the well-Appointed
list of east hollywood C.I.S.

205
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:06,776
I've got Julien after a suspect,

206
00:11:07,477 --> 00:11:09,485
But our arms might not be
long enough to reach him.

207
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,619
Give me a name, and I'll run with it.

208
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,915
Amando Rios.

209
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:15,077
If he's our guy, we want
in on him sooner than later.

210
00:11:15,544 --> 00:11:16,709
Never heard of him.

211
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:18,387
Let me plug it into our system.

212
00:11:18,422 --> 00:11:20,123
I'll try to get back
to you within the hour.

213
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,162
Victim used a crowbar to break in.

214
00:11:26,763 --> 00:11:28,989
Teenage resident Lloyd
Denton called it in.

215
00:11:29,256 --> 00:11:30,156
He's our shooter.

216
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:32,859
All right. What are you doing out here?

217
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,760
I'm riding with Hanlon today -

218
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:36,806
Mandated monthly street duty.

219
00:11:36,807 --> 00:11:37,507
No I.D. On the victim.

220
00:11:38,508 --> 00:11:40,398
Denton was home alone,
heard the glass break.

221
00:11:40,444 --> 00:11:42,268
Family's got a gun in the house.

222
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:43,779
Anybody talk to the boy yet?

223
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,539
He isn't saying much.
He's pretty freaked out.

224
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,507
Little armenia torch job makes it
a busy day to be out of the barn.

225
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:53,055
I'm checking in. I figured if
I waited for the right time,

226
00:11:53,156 --> 00:11:55,223
I'd never get these street hours done.

227
00:11:55,258 --> 00:11:57,284
The assistant chief won't
make an exception in your case?

228
00:11:57,785 --> 00:11:58,451
I didn't ask him to.

229
00:11:58,452 --> 00:12:00,896
Phillips is aware of your condition.

230
00:12:00,897 --> 00:12:03,666
He also knows that it doesn't
affect my job performance.

231
00:12:04,667 --> 00:12:07,368
Well, it looks like a straight-Up BnE.

232
00:12:07,369 --> 00:12:09,644
We need a parent present
to take the kid's statement.

233
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:12,713
Father's not in the picture, but we
got a call in to the mother at work.

234
00:12:12,748 --> 00:12:14,499
Got this? We need to roll.

235
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,680
Yeah. Take care out there.

236
00:12:18,847 --> 00:12:20,709
Would it have killed her to wear blues?

237
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:24,910
Thanks.

238
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,325
I'm detective Wagenbach.
This is detective Billings.

239
00:12:31,326 --> 00:12:33,553
We're gonna have an officer
take you down to the station.

240
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,686
Your mom's gonna meet us there.

241
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:38,807
Why would Luis break into our house?

242
00:12:40,013 --> 00:12:41,463
You knew the victim?

243
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,471
Yeah, we go to the same high school.

244
00:12:55,573 --> 00:12:58,009
You and Hanlon out
there cracking skulls?

245
00:12:58,676 --> 00:13:00,778
Hey, don't be too rough.
Captain likes things by the book.

246
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,680
I asked Julien for a status report.

247
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:04,791
Amando Rios? Sounds mexican to my ears.

248
00:13:05,792 --> 00:13:09,154
Rios is one of the names that dropped, but I
wouldn't count on it turning into something.

249
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:11,621
Shane, you track down Rezian?

250
00:13:12,724 --> 00:13:17,294
Crispies are two of his mob
lieutenants, Matavian and Bozian.

251
00:13:17,295 --> 00:13:19,572
He shed light on any mexican trouble?

252
00:13:19,573 --> 00:13:20,774
He's as in the dark as we are.

253
00:13:20,775 --> 00:13:22,308
He can't strike back without a target.

254
00:13:22,809 --> 00:13:26,020
Ask Olivia. Maybe the feds can
point us in Rios' direction.

255
00:13:26,173 --> 00:13:27,373
Already on it.

256
00:13:31,409 --> 00:13:33,687
Tina, find me when you get
through the paperwork on this guy.

257
00:13:34,788 --> 00:13:37,565
The Denton kid's up in
1, and that's the mom.

258
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:38,384
Thanks.

259
00:13:40,385 --> 00:13:43,238
Mrs. Denton, I'm detective Wagenbach.

260
00:13:44,805 --> 00:13:45,756
That boy broke in.

261
00:13:46,757 --> 00:13:48,993
I know that Lloyd was
only defending himself.

262
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,861
He shouldn't be in any kind of trouble.

263
00:13:51,162 --> 00:13:54,841
We just need your son to tell us what
happened. He'll be free to go, okay?

264
00:13:55,542 --> 00:13:59,078
I was in the bedroom, doing my
homework, when I heard the glass break.

265
00:13:59,829 --> 00:14:02,039
When did you realize
the intruder was Luis?

266
00:14:03,758 --> 00:14:04,958
Not until after.

267
00:14:05,018 --> 00:14:09,112
I heard someone come in,
and I went to my mom's room.

268
00:14:09,764 --> 00:14:11,024
To get the revolver?

269
00:14:11,691 --> 00:14:14,566
I could hide until whoever
it was took what they wanted,

270
00:14:14,594 --> 00:14:17,835
But he kept coming
closer, so I got the gun.

271
00:14:19,164 --> 00:14:22,001
The neighborhood's all we could
afford since Lloyd's dad left,

272
00:14:22,668 --> 00:14:24,869
So I got that gun for protection.

273
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,496
Ever been fired before now?

274
00:14:27,913 --> 00:14:30,399
Only at the range. I
wanted Lloyd to understand

275
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:34,403
That a gun is a big responsibility,
so we both took safety classes.

276
00:14:34,904 --> 00:14:38,049
Do you and Luis know each other well?

277
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:41,018
I don't even think he knew my name.

278
00:14:41,019 --> 00:14:43,763
I mean, we don't hang out
with the same people, you know,

279
00:14:44,764 --> 00:14:50,167
His friend Diego gave everyone a hard
time, so I just tried to stay away.

280
00:14:56,334 --> 00:14:58,091
Why did he try to break into our house?

281
00:14:58,092 --> 00:15:00,963
I never did anything to
that kid, mom, I swear.

282
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,800
Honey, it isn't your fault.

283
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:08,250
Yeah, but he's dead because of me.

284
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:12,075
How much longer does he have to do this?

285
00:15:14,842 --> 00:15:15,458
Uh...

286
00:15:15,459 --> 00:15:16,586
we'll have more questions.

287
00:15:16,587 --> 00:15:20,097
Why don't you two get a bite,
take a little time alone together?

288
00:15:20,376 --> 00:15:21,659
The rest can wait.

289
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:25,583
Kid seemed pretty busted up.
He had answers for everything.

290
00:15:25,595 --> 00:15:28,790
Yeah, whole scene played out
like the perfect interrogation.

291
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:31,903
One thing I've learned from that sack
of conspiracy theories you call a head -

292
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:35,163
The Wagenbach freak meter
points to red, you listen.

293
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,699
School bully's dead,
picked-On kid did the shooting.

294
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,534
Let's grab up the friend Diego,

295
00:15:40,635 --> 00:15:42,792
Get a read on the locker-Room history.

296
00:15:48,243 --> 00:15:49,443
Can I come in?

297
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:50,681
Uh, okay.

298
00:15:55,182 --> 00:15:55,882
Where's the baby?

299
00:15:57,383 --> 00:15:58,583
He's asleep.

300
00:15:58,997 --> 00:16:01,055
I just put him down. Do your
parents know you're here?

301
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,965
Yeah.

302
00:16:04,266 --> 00:16:06,777
Who does he look like
now, you or my dad?

303
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:11,546
Honey, this is a little unexpected.

304
00:16:11,597 --> 00:16:12,798
What is it that you want?

305
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,359
To talk to you about my dad.

306
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,547
Okay.

307
00:16:18,548 --> 00:16:20,705
I've read stuff online about his job.

308
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:24,465
People think that he's stolen things,
he's hurt people, he's broken the law.

309
00:16:24,744 --> 00:16:25,688
Honey, he's your father.

310
00:16:25,689 --> 00:16:27,903
Do you think he killed Terry Crowley?

311
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:34,996
No.

312
00:16:34,997 --> 00:16:36,790
That's what lieutenant
Jon Kavanaugh thought.

313
00:16:39,091 --> 00:16:42,127
I really think you should just be
thinking about school and things like that.

314
00:16:42,328 --> 00:16:44,329
I need to know who he really is.

315
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:45,540
Well, then, talk to him.

316
00:16:45,741 --> 00:16:49,018
Is he helping you raise Lee?
Does he even give you money?

317
00:16:49,053 --> 00:16:50,148
I haven't asked him to.

318
00:16:51,265 --> 00:16:52,615
I don't blame you.

319
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:54,646
Cassidy, you should go.

320
00:16:54,758 --> 00:16:57,402
I am not the person you should
be having this conversation with.

321
00:16:57,653 --> 00:16:59,020
You have no reason to defend him.

322
00:16:59,021 --> 00:17:02,181
He gets you pregnant, and then
he dumps you. Who does that?

323
00:17:07,147 --> 00:17:10,773
Just wait. I'll be right
back. Just wait right here.

324
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:14,534
Vic!

325
00:17:15,235 --> 00:17:17,670
Hey, you weren't kidding
about the turnaround.

326
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:20,515
Rios' name didn't turn up
anything on our end. I'm sorry.

327
00:17:21,516 --> 00:17:22,434
Eh, long shot.

328
00:17:23,635 --> 00:17:27,059
What makes you think this guy
might be tied to the armo deaths?

329
00:17:27,094 --> 00:17:30,483
Hunch. Got to exhaust all my
resources, and lately that means you.

330
00:17:30,984 --> 00:17:33,252
Not every day a girl's
called a resource.

331
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:35,287
I'll keep an eye out for Rios.

332
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:37,561
And if you hear anything on
your end, give me a shout.

333
00:17:38,228 --> 00:17:39,126
Thanks.

334
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:42,895
If Rios isn't tracking on their radar,

335
00:17:42,996 --> 00:17:45,265
He might not be the cartel
key we're looking for.

336
00:17:45,466 --> 00:17:47,724
Doesn't mean he's not here
to do their dirty work.

337
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,726
Just means he hasn't been caught yet.

338
00:17:49,827 --> 00:17:51,170
What do we do about Rezian?

339
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:54,177
Time to give him the bad news.

340
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:00,745
We tossed your olive
branch to the mexicans.

341
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,774
They're not interested in a sit-Down unless
you can produce their missing box of intel.

342
00:18:04,341 --> 00:18:05,860
Time to make another wish.

343
00:18:07,579 --> 00:18:09,029
Set up the meeting.

344
00:18:10,696 --> 00:18:14,417
I just told you. They won't agree to
the meet unless you have the goods.

345
00:18:14,584 --> 00:18:15,852
What is it you're not hearing?

346
00:18:16,153 --> 00:18:19,264
I have what they want. I'm
prepared to give it back to them.

347
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:23,627
You were crying to us this morning that you didn't
even know what the hell they were looking for.

348
00:18:23,794 --> 00:18:24,803
And now you've got it?

349
00:18:24,894 --> 00:18:26,004
What is it you're not hearing?

350
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:28,097
You've had this mexi
intel the whole time?

351
00:18:28,764 --> 00:18:30,498
We located it a couple of hours ago.

352
00:18:30,533 --> 00:18:33,212
We're not walking into a mexican
hat dance without a ticket.

353
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:38,207
This information
- What does it say that's so valuable to them?

354
00:18:38,874 --> 00:18:42,061
You're here to repay your debt.
The rest is none of your concern.

355
00:18:42,883 --> 00:18:44,333
Set up the meeting.

356
00:18:48,785 --> 00:18:49,985
He's bigger.

357
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,220
Yeah.

358
00:18:58,427 --> 00:19:00,638
You're supposed to be at
school, taking that make-Up quiz.

359
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,340
What are your grades gonna be now?

360
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:04,668
If you didn't ground me, I
wouldn't have to sneak out.

361
00:19:04,835 --> 00:19:06,035
Let's go, right now.

362
00:19:06,144 --> 00:19:07,396
Let go of me!

363
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:08,804
We are going home now!

364
00:19:10,805 --> 00:19:12,024
My backpack's in the other room.

365
00:19:12,034 --> 00:19:13,284
Then go get it.

366
00:19:22,451 --> 00:19:23,193
Thanks for calling me.

367
00:19:24,194 --> 00:19:26,399
Hey, it's just a preview of
what I have to look forward to.

368
00:19:29,466 --> 00:19:31,535
She was asking a lot
of questions about Vic.

369
00:19:31,736 --> 00:19:32,936
How did you answer them?

370
00:19:32,993 --> 00:19:35,197
It's not my place. She's
pretty angry, though.

371
00:19:36,714 --> 00:19:37,943
I think we all are.

372
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:42,445
We talked to Luis' friend Diego Vargas.

373
00:19:42,446 --> 00:19:45,206
They were selling drugs
at school, came up short,

374
00:19:45,473 --> 00:19:46,849
Had a need for some fast cash.

375
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,593
So, then, it all makes
sense why this kid broke in.

376
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,021
Yeah.

377
00:19:52,022 --> 00:19:54,423
Lloyd, did you say something to Luis

378
00:19:55,124 --> 00:19:58,203
About money, jewelry, something
like that in your house?

379
00:19:58,654 --> 00:19:59,262
No.

380
00:20:01,263 --> 00:20:03,289
I told you, it's not
like we really ever spoke.

381
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:07,227
Anybody at school know your
schedule, that your mom worked a lot?

382
00:20:07,378 --> 00:20:09,814
Maybe. I mean, I don't
think so, but maybe.

383
00:20:11,481 --> 00:20:13,716
And you didn't realize it
was Luis when you shot him?

384
00:20:14,117 --> 00:20:15,211
He already told you that.

385
00:20:16,212 --> 00:20:18,220
So, when did you recognize who it was?

386
00:20:19,881 --> 00:20:21,457
When I walked over to the body.

387
00:20:21,874 --> 00:20:23,159
How long before you called 911?

388
00:20:23,194 --> 00:20:23,809
Right that second.

389
00:20:23,844 --> 00:20:26,896
Must have been upsetting -

390
00:20:27,149 --> 00:20:28,399
All that blood.

391
00:20:30,594 --> 00:20:31,260
Look, can I go now?

392
00:20:32,761 --> 00:20:35,020
I've answered all your
questions a bunch of times.

393
00:20:36,621 --> 00:20:38,467
Diego said Luis was pretty sure

394
00:20:38,534 --> 00:20:42,772
He was gonna find $1,000 in
cash somewhere in your house.

395
00:20:45,139 --> 00:20:47,208
The most expensive thing we own

396
00:20:47,509 --> 00:20:49,535
Is a 25-Inch color tv, detective.

397
00:20:51,258 --> 00:20:52,908
This guy's all I've got.

398
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,944
Mrs. Denton, we're
concerned about your son.

399
00:20:59,111 --> 00:21:01,113
Case lines up, shooting's
obviously clean.

400
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,090
Normally, we send you home.

401
00:21:03,091 --> 00:21:05,117
But crime victims sustain
a lot of mental trauma.

402
00:21:05,618 --> 00:21:08,253
Given his age, I'm worried that
Lloyd doesn't have the tools

403
00:21:08,254 --> 00:21:10,631
To deal with this emotionally,
especially with no father around.

404
00:21:10,832 --> 00:21:12,733
He's been through so much already.

405
00:21:12,734 --> 00:21:14,926
Must be hard raising him on your own.

406
00:21:14,927 --> 00:21:18,005
I keep riding him about
doing his schoolwork

407
00:21:18,072 --> 00:21:20,068
And the importance of a good education.

408
00:21:20,133 --> 00:21:20,908
I never got to college.

409
00:21:21,109 --> 00:21:22,667
How's he doing, grade-Wise?

410
00:21:22,668 --> 00:21:25,378
His teachers say he won't apply himself.

411
00:21:25,779 --> 00:21:27,818
He won't do his homework,
but then he aces his tests.

412
00:21:28,516 --> 00:21:30,041
But he averages out to a "c. "

413
00:21:30,042 --> 00:21:32,252
It's common for kids
with really high IQ's.

414
00:21:32,253 --> 00:21:34,822
Lloyd said he was doing his
homework when Luis broke in.

415
00:21:35,423 --> 00:21:37,665
Yeah, I guess he finally
started listening to me.

416
00:21:39,283 --> 00:21:40,860
Would you mind if I stayed in touch?

417
00:21:41,061 --> 00:21:43,321
I want to make sure that Lloyd
gets all the help he needs.

418
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:46,375
Yes, of course.

419
00:21:47,728 --> 00:21:48,537
Great.

420
00:21:50,538 --> 00:21:52,372
We know Rezian's lying about the box,

421
00:21:52,373 --> 00:21:54,407
So we can't anticipate his next move.

422
00:21:54,408 --> 00:21:56,142
We got to be ready for anything.

423
00:21:56,143 --> 00:21:57,810
He's probably using
us to prep a shoot-Out.

424
00:21:58,311 --> 00:22:00,146
What are the specs on this place?

425
00:22:00,181 --> 00:22:01,981
No surveillance, two points of entry.

426
00:22:01,982 --> 00:22:04,999
Means I can back you up from out here.

427
00:22:05,072 --> 00:22:06,085
Get in touch with Rezian.

428
00:22:06,286 --> 00:22:08,020
Tell him three men only
- No weapons.

429
00:22:08,621 --> 00:22:10,881
You've been playing both sides.
How are you gonna pull this off?

430
00:22:11,277 --> 00:22:12,691
I got to stay as neutral as possible,

431
00:22:12,692 --> 00:22:14,898
Which means if shit goes
sideways, you got to contain it.

432
00:22:15,949 --> 00:22:20,239
No problem. At least we're
all three together on this one.

433
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:21,167
Yeah.

434
00:22:22,168 --> 00:22:23,979
You show me a better way, I'll take it.

435
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,133
He's got a location on
Pezuela's lapdog, Rios

436
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,710
Wants us to meet him there.

437
00:22:31,911 --> 00:22:34,114
How is that possible
when Olivia came up empty?

438
00:22:34,881 --> 00:22:37,173
Guess the enthusiastic supercop
turned over the right rock.

439
00:22:38,374 --> 00:22:39,950
Picking up Rios means
there's no meeting,

440
00:22:39,951 --> 00:22:41,686
Buys us some time to figure
out what's Rezian's playing.

441
00:22:41,687 --> 00:22:43,955
Being the arresting officer
screws Vic with Pezuela.

442
00:22:43,956 --> 00:22:46,499
We got to lock up Julien
so he doesn't blow our plan.

443
00:22:55,038 --> 00:22:56,725
Friend of mine landed at border patrol.

444
00:22:56,926 --> 00:22:58,628
Rios is on their unofficial watch list.

445
00:22:58,729 --> 00:22:59,662
They're tracking him?

446
00:22:59,663 --> 00:23:01,406
They don't have enough
manpower to do that,

447
00:23:01,441 --> 00:23:03,537
But they do know that Rios has
some family at this address.

448
00:23:06,604 --> 00:23:07,871
Amazing work.

449
00:23:07,872 --> 00:23:11,174
Just trying to chip in. Neighbor said
they saw him go in a couple hours ago.

450
00:23:12,915 --> 00:23:14,449
Me and Vic will take the back.

451
00:23:26,102 --> 00:23:28,691
Police. Open up. We want
to ask you some questions.

452
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,751
Police. Open this door. Last chance.

453
00:23:31,752 --> 00:23:33,889
Open this door. Police, open up!

454
00:23:36,113 --> 00:23:37,313
Go.

455
00:23:37,351 --> 00:23:38,551
Kitchen's clear.

456
00:23:38,611 --> 00:23:39,717
Bedroom, clear.

457
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:40,312
Clear.

458
00:23:41,313 --> 00:23:43,540
The tv's on. Looks like
we just missed someone.

459
00:23:44,107 --> 00:23:47,393
Let's look around, see if
there's any signs of Amando Rios.

460
00:23:55,603 --> 00:23:57,812
So, we done talking
this Lloyd thing through?

461
00:23:57,979 --> 00:24:00,571
You spinning grassy knoll
doesn't do anything for us.

462
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:03,475
A profile
- Male, highly intelligent,

463
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:07,279
Unstable family, pisspoor student,

464
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:08,479
Abandoned by his father.

465
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,414
The mom's got a big
old Dutch-Boy crush -

466
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:13,701
Obviously a couple of
genetic screws loose.

467
00:24:13,868 --> 00:24:14,594
The kid's off.

468
00:24:15,595 --> 00:24:18,655
All right, let's say he
lures the school bully over,

469
00:24:18,656 --> 00:24:20,935
Shoots him for payback
over some perceived slight?

470
00:24:21,902 --> 00:24:24,178
I don't get anger off
Lloyd. I get nothing.

471
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:26,062
That's the problem.

472
00:24:26,063 --> 00:24:28,080
He stood there and watched somebody die

473
00:24:28,308 --> 00:24:29,565
Like it was no big thing.

474
00:24:29,566 --> 00:24:33,103
There's speculation Bundy's first
murders were committed in his early teens.

475
00:24:33,304 --> 00:24:36,555
They gain reinforcement the
more crimes they get away with -

476
00:24:36,574 --> 00:24:37,974
Gain power, their methods improve.

477
00:24:37,975 --> 00:24:40,510
Wait a minute. I buy the setup theory.

478
00:24:40,611 --> 00:24:43,328
But are you saying this
kid's a serial killer?

479
00:24:43,856 --> 00:24:46,081
They all pop their cherry somewhere.

480
00:24:46,882 --> 00:24:48,955
You know all the rules,
so let's play nice.

481
00:24:52,922 --> 00:24:56,544
Once you've returned your seat backs and
tray tables to their upright position...

482
00:24:58,133 --> 00:24:59,883
then we'll be in business.

483
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:08,473
Okay, we're all here.
Who wants to share first?

484
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:14,227
There's a misunderstanding that's
causing a lot of problems for us.

485
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:16,900
Where's the box?

486
00:25:22,067 --> 00:25:23,252
We don't have it.

487
00:25:23,253 --> 00:25:25,663
Oh, God damn it! That's
not what he told us!

488
00:25:25,664 --> 00:25:28,299
I only set this up because
you said you could deliver!

489
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:31,503
Your people stabbed me in jail,
killed two of my men today.

490
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:33,294
You made your strength very clear.

491
00:25:33,295 --> 00:25:35,239
Everybody just take a deep breath.

492
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,791
It has nothing to do with us.

493
00:25:36,792 --> 00:25:37,608
Step back.

494
00:25:37,609 --> 00:25:40,611
I risked coming empty-Handed
because I want to prove

495
00:25:40,612 --> 00:25:42,737
The armenians have no stake in this war.

496
00:25:43,438 --> 00:25:45,578
So, you tell me. Who has what we want?

497
00:25:45,613 --> 00:25:47,718
I don't know how this rumor got started,

498
00:25:47,719 --> 00:25:49,949
But I can't give you what I don't have.

499
00:25:54,016 --> 00:25:56,584
We're businessmen. If you'll
agree to look someplace else,

500
00:25:56,685 --> 00:25:59,760
We're willing to let today's
murders go unanswered,

501
00:25:59,795 --> 00:26:02,835
And we'll help you find
who took what you lost.

502
00:26:14,202 --> 00:26:16,312
Rezian's lying through
his armenian teeth.

503
00:26:16,313 --> 00:26:18,805
This is what he wants
- You doubting the truth.

504
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,749
It clears him for retribution.

505
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,684
You sound desperate to prove your worth.

506
00:26:21,685 --> 00:26:24,211
What good is a dirty cop
selling bad information?

507
00:26:24,212 --> 00:26:26,589
My information is still dead-On.

508
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:28,925
You're the only one saying
the armenians have the box.

509
00:26:28,926 --> 00:26:30,427
And I've still never seen any proof.

510
00:26:30,428 --> 00:26:32,919
One day, the blackmail box goes missing.

511
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,631
The next, Rezian springs himself

512
00:26:34,632 --> 00:26:37,608
From a sure-Thing tour in county jail.

513
00:26:37,668 --> 00:26:41,461
Even you can connect those dots.

514
00:26:41,478 --> 00:26:42,438
It's not enough.

515
00:26:42,439 --> 00:26:46,917
Maybe we need to look
for it somewhere else.

516
00:26:46,977 --> 00:26:49,602
A kid Lloyd's age shouldn't have to deal

517
00:26:49,603 --> 00:26:52,949
With something this
potentially damaging alone.

518
00:26:53,116 --> 00:26:55,508
Well, he's not alone, detective.

519
00:26:55,509 --> 00:26:57,826
I'm sorry. Of course he's not.

520
00:26:58,487 --> 00:27:01,782
My dad died when I was a little guy
- 6 years old.

521
00:27:02,949 --> 00:27:03,516
Oh, I'm so sorry.

522
00:27:03,517 --> 00:27:06,261
The point is I know
what it's like to grow up

523
00:27:06,262 --> 00:27:08,254
Without a man around to relate to.

524
00:27:09,355 --> 00:27:11,641
Oh, Chuck wasn't all that relatable

525
00:27:11,801 --> 00:27:14,093
Even when he was still with us.

526
00:27:14,163 --> 00:27:16,013
He drank... a lot.

527
00:27:19,516 --> 00:27:20,475
At my age,

528
00:27:20,476 --> 00:27:23,302
It's like a buyer's
market out there for men.

529
00:27:23,303 --> 00:27:27,306
I just never felt the need to settle.

530
00:27:28,473 --> 00:27:30,294
A woman like you shouldn't have to.

531
00:27:33,044 --> 00:27:33,044
Oh, detective Billings.

532
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:36,248
Are you sure I can't
get you some coffee?

533
00:27:36,415 --> 00:27:37,458
No, I'm good.

534
00:27:37,459 --> 00:27:39,504
But can you point me in the
direction of the restroom?

535
00:27:39,528 --> 00:27:43,731
Oh, second door on the left.

536
00:27:44,932 --> 00:27:47,460
I want you to know
that I'm here to help.

537
00:27:49,227 --> 00:27:52,638
House calls don't seem like they're
part of your job description, detective.

538
00:27:52,639 --> 00:27:55,217
I'm not the sort of cop that punches
out at the end of eight hours.

539
00:27:56,936 --> 00:27:58,686
And please, call me Dutch.

540
00:27:58,853 --> 00:27:59,303
Okay?

541
00:28:00,087 --> 00:28:00,747
Okay, Dutch.

542
00:28:00,748 --> 00:28:03,417
The more you tell me about Lloyd,

543
00:28:03,418 --> 00:28:05,676
The better I can help both of you.

544
00:28:05,677 --> 00:28:09,296
I understand. Whatever you need.

545
00:28:09,981 --> 00:28:12,059
You want coffee? Please.

546
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:16,196
Does Lloyd have any friends at
school, someone he can talk to?

547
00:28:17,197 --> 00:28:19,333
There aren't a lot of white
kids. Not that that matters.

548
00:28:19,834 --> 00:28:22,168
But with all the drugs
and gang activities,

549
00:28:22,203 --> 00:28:24,797
I always hoped that he would
just find himself a girlfriend.

550
00:28:27,064 --> 00:28:28,675
I mean, he is a good-Looking kid.

551
00:28:28,676 --> 00:28:30,867
I wasn't ready to date until college.

552
00:28:30,868 --> 00:28:33,036
Some of us are slow learners.

553
00:28:33,037 --> 00:28:33,626
Hmm.

554
00:28:33,627 --> 00:28:37,083
Rita, it might be a good idea
for you to bring Lloyd back in.

555
00:28:37,084 --> 00:28:40,678
You want him to process
this in a healthy way.

556
00:28:40,845 --> 00:28:45,465
We can submit the case file along
with a videotape of the interview,

557
00:28:45,592 --> 00:28:49,652
Maybe pry some money out of the state to
pay for some sessions with a psychologist.

558
00:28:50,153 --> 00:28:52,431
Yeah, you know how
these bureaucrats are -

559
00:28:52,432 --> 00:28:55,008
All these hoops they
want you to jump through.

560
00:28:57,392 --> 00:29:00,974
Well, if you think it's the right thing.

561
00:29:02,875 --> 00:29:03,965
He's what?

562
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:05,310
He's on his way in.

563
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:09,420
From now on, if you need
to reach me, call.

564
00:29:09,455 --> 00:29:12,030
We need a quick
armenian political win -

565
00:29:12,197 --> 00:29:13,218
Something public.

566
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:15,453
You help me with that,
I promise you,

567
00:29:15,454 --> 00:29:17,748
The first domino falls
at Pezuela's feet.

568
00:29:19,115 --> 00:29:20,121
Why the armenians?

569
00:29:20,182 --> 00:29:23,761
Pezuela's got it in his head that
the armenians have the blackmail box.

570
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:26,890
We need him to continue
thinking that. That's all.

571
00:29:28,857 --> 00:29:32,442
It's our best shot at getting
Pezuela to incriminate himself.

572
00:29:37,669 --> 00:29:40,604
Since the mayor recognized
the armenian genocide,

573
00:29:40,605 --> 00:29:43,841
The supporters have proposed
a commemorating memorial.

574
00:29:44,008 --> 00:29:48,068
The funds have been denied every
year by the same city employee.

575
00:29:48,069 --> 00:29:52,361
And mr. Istanbul with the tight
fist, he's in the blackmail box?

576
00:29:56,761 --> 00:30:00,797
I don't know that a plan to erect some
monument is enough to ruffle feathers.

577
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:03,502
It sounds small, but it'll
resonate big on the right ears.

578
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:05,909
You give me the name,
I'll put it in play.

579
00:30:09,576 --> 00:30:10,207
You know him.

580
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:12,058
It's the city controller -

581
00:30:13,257 --> 00:30:14,416
Robert Martin.

582
00:30:20,417 --> 00:30:22,065
What's Pezuela got
on him?

583
00:30:22,366 --> 00:30:22,987
Insider trading.

584
00:30:24,488 --> 00:30:27,257
I was hoping to free him from
this noose, not tighten it myself.

585
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:30,300
I'm not launching anything
that's gonna hurt your pal.

586
00:30:31,385 --> 00:30:33,951
You're looking
at a long campaign.

587
00:30:33,954 --> 00:30:36,776
You better get used
to pressing the tough buttons.

588
00:30:42,625 --> 00:30:44,197
Controller Martin,
please.

589
00:30:45,698 --> 00:30:47,199
I'm a friend
who's got information

590
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,934
About his deal
with the Berkeley group.

591
00:30:49,285 --> 00:30:49,852
What?

592
00:30:50,517 --> 00:30:51,967
That's what he said.

593
00:30:52,384 --> 00:30:52,982
Who is this?

594
00:30:52,983 --> 00:30:56,078
Insider trading is a crime.
You've been a bad boy.

595
00:30:57,845 --> 00:30:58,311
Uh...

596
00:30:59,512 --> 00:31:01,348
I don't know what you're talking about.

597
00:31:01,383 --> 00:31:01,724
Sure you do.

598
00:31:01,725 --> 00:31:04,059
Communications about the deal
you made so much money on,

599
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,219
They've got a new owner,
and that owner's priorities

600
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,588
Include protecting
armenian interests.

601
00:31:09,589 --> 00:31:11,133
Yeah, well,
that all sounds pretty vague.

602
00:31:11,134 --> 00:31:13,835
The only thing that would make
today's flag-Waving sweeter

603
00:31:13,836 --> 00:31:16,204
Is the announcement
that their ancestors

604
00:31:16,205 --> 00:31:17,873
Will be commemorated
in stone.

605
00:31:17,874 --> 00:31:21,343
The memorial? Oh, no, no, no.
It's too late for that.

606
00:31:21,378 --> 00:31:23,002
No, not when you've
got information

607
00:31:23,003 --> 00:31:24,779
That gives you
the inside track,

608
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,606
Just like you did
with Berkeley.

609
00:31:28,907 --> 00:31:30,552
Guess you've got
some calls to make.

610
00:31:32,853 --> 00:31:34,555
I would have loved to
have dealt the blow myself.

611
00:31:34,756 --> 00:31:37,582
Asshole never did pay me
back for the favor he owes me.

612
00:31:37,583 --> 00:31:38,914
He would have known
your voice in a second.

613
00:31:38,949 --> 00:31:40,269
Now he's gonna know my foot up his ass.

614
00:31:42,254 --> 00:31:44,841
Only question is how long is it
gonna take Pezuela to boil over?

615
00:31:49,259 --> 00:31:54,163
City controller announced plans for an LA.
Monument recognizing the armenian genocide.

616
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:58,950
Well, so what? A slab of marble gonna
disrupt your vision for the city?

617
00:32:00,117 --> 00:32:04,290
Robert Martin suddenly supporting the
armenian interests means Rezian was lying.

618
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:07,217
You were right.

619
00:32:07,218 --> 00:32:10,068
You really think Rezian would
choose a monument to show his hand?

620
00:32:10,235 --> 00:32:11,680
It doesn't seem too smart.

621
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:13,856
It's not.

622
00:32:13,907 --> 00:32:16,542
But it means my information
has limited exposure.

623
00:32:16,593 --> 00:32:18,618
The plans will be presented
to the community

624
00:32:18,653 --> 00:32:19,972
At the march
this afternoon.

625
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:23,090
Rezian won't be able to resist
showing his face there.

626
00:32:24,257 --> 00:32:26,535
Hey, we agreed.
No civilian casualties.

627
00:32:26,836 --> 00:32:29,471
I see one gunman at that rally
in little armenia,

628
00:32:29,472 --> 00:32:32,242
And you'll be hunting for
that blackmail box on your own.

629
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:35,629
No armenian civilians
will get hurt.

630
00:32:35,746 --> 00:32:36,769
Hey, wait.

631
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:38,622
I'll find a way
to get it back to you.

632
00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:40,159
Do it quickly.

633
00:32:43,276 --> 00:32:46,497
Once you review and sign your statement,

634
00:32:47,753 --> 00:32:49,103
We'll be through.

635
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,040
You miss your dad?

636
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:00,742
What there was to like
about him, I guess.

637
00:33:00,993 --> 00:33:02,996
I hardly rember
my own father.

638
00:33:03,363 --> 00:33:04,606
Well, I bet he would be proud.

639
00:33:06,107 --> 00:33:09,435
A detective seems like a
pretty honorable profession.

640
00:33:10,902 --> 00:33:14,248
We need another signature downstairs,
Lloyd being a minor and so forth.

641
00:33:26,384 --> 00:33:27,584
This, uh -

642
00:33:27,738 --> 00:33:29,088
This section here,

643
00:33:30,005 --> 00:33:32,717
Where you were when you
heard Luis break in -

644
00:33:32,784 --> 00:33:34,512
What were you doing, again?

645
00:33:37,963 --> 00:33:40,965
Well, it says I was in my
bedroom, doing my homework.

646
00:33:42,002 --> 00:33:42,811
Right.

647
00:33:45,312 --> 00:33:48,583
You have a lot of drawings
of yourself, don't you?

648
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,170
A lot of great artists
did self-Portraits.

649
00:33:52,587 --> 00:33:54,795
You consider yourself
an artist?

650
00:33:56,596 --> 00:33:57,290
Not really.

651
00:33:57,325 --> 00:34:00,494
I don't draw that well,
actually.

652
00:34:00,495 --> 00:34:03,331
A lot of things a person can
do to be considered an artist.

653
00:34:05,498 --> 00:34:06,533
What subject?

654
00:34:06,534 --> 00:34:06,923
Hmm?

655
00:34:06,924 --> 00:34:10,316
What subject were you studying
when you heard Luis break in?

656
00:34:10,617 --> 00:34:10,870
Chem.

657
00:34:10,905 --> 00:34:13,579
Your mom says you don't
do very well in chemistry.

658
00:34:13,698 --> 00:34:15,699
Yeah, well,
I'm making an effort.

659
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:18,652
A couple of things,
looking over this statement,

660
00:34:18,769 --> 00:34:20,446
Didn't quite
make sense to me.

661
00:34:20,447 --> 00:34:22,723
Are you sure this is exactly
how this all went down?

662
00:34:23,741 --> 00:34:25,818
That is
the whole truth, yes.

663
00:34:25,819 --> 00:34:28,621
Luis came looking for what
he thought was an easy payday,

664
00:34:28,622 --> 00:34:31,447
In broad daylight, with you
ready to defend yourself.

665
00:34:31,448 --> 00:34:33,025
I wasn't ready for anything.

666
00:34:33,226 --> 00:34:35,573
Okay, I was writing a
chemistry lab report.

667
00:34:35,608 --> 00:34:37,386
I have it half-Finished
if you'd like to see.

668
00:34:37,421 --> 00:34:41,315
You heard him break in, went into your
mom's room, got the gun from her closet.

669
00:34:41,368 --> 00:34:44,529
You must have learned always to keep the
gun unloaded until you're ready to use it.

670
00:34:45,696 --> 00:34:48,313
So, you had time
to load the weapon

671
00:34:48,332 --> 00:34:50,765
As you heard
the intruder approach?

672
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:53,412
It was adrenaline,
I guess.

673
00:34:53,413 --> 00:34:55,514
You were nervous at this point,
hands shaking

674
00:34:55,515 --> 00:34:57,791
As you tried to put the bullets
in the chamber?

675
00:34:59,241 --> 00:35:00,472
I was scared, yeah.

676
00:35:00,643 --> 00:35:02,788
You didn't see Luis' face until -

677
00:35:02,789 --> 00:35:04,884
Until I walked over to his body.

678
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:10,529
Lloyd...

679
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:17,810
why is it, 10 hours after
killing someone, you seem past it?

680
00:35:21,939 --> 00:35:23,441
Just for shits and giggles,

681
00:35:24,342 --> 00:35:26,845
Let me tell you how I think
this might have gone down

682
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,080
If it had been, say, a murder.

683
00:35:30,331 --> 00:35:32,066
You could have gone to Luis yourself,

684
00:35:32,217 --> 00:35:33,952
Told him about some theoretical
cash lying around your house.

685
00:35:33,953 --> 00:35:36,846
"You make it look like a
robbery. We'll split it 50/50."

686
00:35:37,013 --> 00:35:40,683
Only when Luis breaks in...
you're waiting there to kill him -

687
00:35:43,333 --> 00:35:45,096
See what it feels like.

688
00:35:46,063 --> 00:35:47,877
A science experiment
you could ace...

689
00:35:52,596 --> 00:35:54,246
...stand over the body,

690
00:35:55,013 --> 00:35:56,604
Life draing out of him,

691
00:35:57,553 --> 00:35:59,253
Watch him die.

692
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,613
Certain kind of person -

693
00:36:04,364 --> 00:36:06,596
Might make you feel like superman.

694
00:36:13,947 --> 00:36:16,036
I was never big
on comic books.

695
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:29,524
Go ahead and sign that statement
if you're satisfied.

696
00:36:31,475 --> 00:36:33,325
You know, it's only natural,

697
00:36:34,349 --> 00:36:35,612
A tragedy like this,

698
00:36:36,529 --> 00:36:39,124
For the person who walks away
to blame themselves.

699
00:36:42,001 --> 00:36:44,287
Promise me
you won't do that.

700
00:36:45,215 --> 00:36:46,465
I'll try not to.

701
00:36:56,957 --> 00:36:59,226
We're happy that the council
was able to support us on this.

702
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:01,828
Thank you. I appreciate it.

703
00:37:01,995 --> 00:37:02,795
David.

704
00:37:03,496 --> 00:37:05,740
Robert,
surprised to see you here.

705
00:37:06,341 --> 00:37:08,108
It's not the cause I reject.

706
00:37:08,109 --> 00:37:10,045
It's the needless spending
on gratuitous events.

707
00:37:10,212 --> 00:37:12,847
Council was happy to hear
you had a change of heart.

708
00:37:14,048 --> 00:37:15,616
You see anyone
eyeing Rezian?

709
00:37:16,217 --> 00:37:19,219
I see a lot of ladies who need some
hot wax, but none of them brown.

710
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,481
Until this is over, Rezian
doesn't leave our sight line.

711
00:37:22,648 --> 00:37:25,150
If a hit was ordered, it'll
go down before the speeches,

712
00:37:25,151 --> 00:37:26,932
When the crowd is still unfocused.

713
00:37:30,099 --> 00:37:32,500
The armenian cause deserves
as much representation

714
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:34,393
As that of any other ethnic group.

715
00:37:34,994 --> 00:37:38,273
Of course. This memorial is one
of the few times I can rember

716
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,265
Where we haven't seen eye to eye.

717
00:37:41,282 --> 00:37:42,678
Let's get started.

718
00:37:45,285 --> 00:37:46,671
Get down! Get down!

719
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,350
Go! Go! Go! Go!

720
00:37:52,143 --> 00:37:53,343
Robert!

721
00:37:53,612 --> 00:37:55,062
Robert! Oh, my God!

722
00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:56,732
I need a medic!

723
00:37:58,252 --> 00:37:59,702
I need a medic now!

724
00:38:10,981 --> 00:38:14,786
A city official is dead. Second
crime in little armenia today,

725
00:38:14,821 --> 00:38:16,698
And we're still nowhere on the first.

726
00:38:16,699 --> 00:38:18,667
This armenian-Mexican trouble is real.

727
00:38:19,168 --> 00:38:22,904
I'm still trying to get a handle on
how it started and who's behind it.

728
00:38:22,905 --> 00:38:26,659
Then I want more than just Julien in
my barn with his nose to the ground.

729
00:38:33,326 --> 00:38:34,976
You and me, we're done!

730
00:38:35,423 --> 00:38:36,623
Keep your money!

731
00:38:36,683 --> 00:38:38,556
There's an important place
for you in my business.

732
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:40,087
That was
a goddamn assassination.

733
00:38:40,088 --> 00:38:42,590
Martin had nothing to do
with your armenian beef.

734
00:38:42,591 --> 00:38:44,959
You flipped the switch on him
to send a message -

735
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,430
"You use the blackmail box,
these are the consequences. "

736
00:38:49,097 --> 00:38:50,347
We had a deal, man.

737
00:38:51,437 --> 00:38:54,960
Contain the violence. And
I'm still a goddamn cop!

738
00:38:55,195 --> 00:38:58,734
Not for long. And not without me.

739
00:39:03,401 --> 00:39:05,570
You better pray
this doesn't blow back on you.

740
00:39:05,737 --> 00:39:07,458
That's what I have you for.

741
00:39:12,118 --> 00:39:15,135
Between the fire you set
and the controller's murder,

742
00:39:15,221 --> 00:39:18,196
You have started one hell
of a shit storm for us.

743
00:39:18,215 --> 00:39:20,285
Isn't that what
you're being compensated for?

744
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,528
Forget compensation!

745
00:39:22,329 --> 00:39:24,063
You better give me someone
to take the hit

746
00:39:24,324 --> 00:39:26,159
For those burning murders
this morning right now,

747
00:39:26,194 --> 00:39:28,502
Or I swear to God,
I will make sure

748
00:39:28,503 --> 00:39:31,608
That blackmail box stays
in little armenia permanently.

749
00:39:38,304 --> 00:39:40,154
...life draining out of him,

750
00:39:40,673 --> 00:39:41,873
Watch him die.

751
00:39:43,086 --> 00:39:44,318
Certain kind of person -

752
00:39:45,735 --> 00:39:47,881
Might make you feel like superman.

753
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:53,884
I was never big on comic books.

754
00:39:54,951 --> 00:39:57,628
16 years old, already figured out

755
00:39:57,629 --> 00:39:59,864
How to commit a crime like
this and walk away clean.

756
00:39:59,899 --> 00:40:01,466
If he was gonna break, he would have.

757
00:40:01,667 --> 00:40:03,928
Even if he had confessed, it
wouldn't have been admissible.

758
00:40:04,495 --> 00:40:05,161
What if I'm right?

759
00:40:05,662 --> 00:40:08,441
There are times when you entertain
the possibility that you're not?

760
00:40:09,342 --> 00:40:13,036
We let this go, and Luis
is just victim number one.

761
00:40:13,203 --> 00:40:15,547
He's a kid. He's already
pulled off the perfect murder.

762
00:40:15,548 --> 00:40:17,457
Maybe it went down just like he says.

763
00:40:18,942 --> 00:40:20,292
We'll never know.

764
00:40:20,428 --> 00:40:22,078
Until victim number two.

765
00:40:27,617 --> 00:40:31,730
Go ahead and sign that
if you're satisfied.

766
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,656
Everything we have on Rios.

767
00:40:34,657 --> 00:40:36,362
I tried before, Vic.
He's not in our system.

768
00:40:36,397 --> 00:40:37,443
Try again.

769
00:40:40,944 --> 00:40:42,848
You think he's connected to
the shooting in little armenia?

770
00:40:43,142 --> 00:40:43,876
Vic.

771
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:49,622
Councilman David Aceveda,
federal agent Olivia Murray.

772
00:40:50,391 --> 00:40:51,591
Councilman.

773
00:40:53,541 --> 00:40:55,894
I'll, um, shake a few more trees, then.

774
00:40:56,515 --> 00:40:57,711
Thanks.

775
00:41:01,712 --> 00:41:04,961
Hey, man, I didn't know
what was gonna go down.

776
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:07,038
You have me give you an armenian win,

777
00:41:08,398 --> 00:41:10,568
And their march turns
into a goddamn killing?

778
00:41:10,603 --> 00:41:11,859
That was never part of the plan.

779
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,570
You know, Martin was my colleague, Vic.

780
00:41:13,605 --> 00:41:16,484
Now, you may not care who
has to die to save your job,

781
00:41:16,985 --> 00:41:19,283
Your ass, but I did
not sign up for this!

782
00:41:20,184 --> 00:41:22,780
You signed up for this the moment
you got into bed with Pezuela.

783
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:27,641
I want Pezuela in prison
and out of my life now!

784
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:30,578
Martin didn't deserve to die, but
now we have something concrete.

785
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:32,888
And something we cannot prove, Vic.

786
00:41:33,015 --> 00:41:34,257
May be we can't,

787
00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:36,693
But that's why I've been
reaching out to Olivia Murray.

788
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:42,111
If she can make a connection
between Rios and the cartel,

789
00:41:42,278 --> 00:41:42,999
It insulates us.

790
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,835
Pezuela goes down, maybe I keep my job,

791
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:48,051
And you stay teed up
for the bigger office.

792
00:41:55,118 --> 00:41:56,318
Hey, who's that?

793
00:41:56,337 --> 00:41:59,014
Pedro and Miguel. Still got smoke
in their hair from the fire they set.

794
00:41:59,015 --> 00:42:02,743
Witness at the arson site was afraid to come
forward until the Robert Martin shooting.

795
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:07,455
Okay, good. Make sure the entire
team expresses their gratitude.

796
00:42:14,122 --> 00:42:15,772
Why kill the controller?

797
00:42:16,105 --> 00:42:20,093
He supported your cause. Mexicans
wanted to make it clear they didn't.

798
00:42:21,094 --> 00:42:24,348
They think I had something to do with
the genocide memorial being proposed?

799
00:42:25,399 --> 00:42:26,599
Yeah.

800
00:42:28,144 --> 00:42:29,533
We need to find this box.

801
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:30,942
Yeah, well, good luck.

802
00:42:31,213 --> 00:42:33,807
I need your help to do
it. It's your final favor.

803
00:42:35,204 --> 00:42:38,428
And you and your friend are free
from my organization's punishment.

804
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:42,433
Well, all right, then.

805
00:42:46,085 --> 00:42:47,535
Hey, you got a sec?

806
00:42:47,702 --> 00:42:49,596
Sure. Two, even.

807
00:42:50,497 --> 00:42:52,273
I just need you
to sign this.

808
00:42:52,291 --> 00:42:54,508
It's about lee.
My lawyer drew it up.

809
00:42:54,627 --> 00:42:57,131
Your lawyer? Since when do
we talk through a mouthpiece?

810
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,701
You want to tell me
what this shit means?

811
00:43:03,468 --> 00:43:05,470
That you waive your
parental rights to my son.

812
00:43:06,137 --> 00:43:08,873
We've talked about this before.
It's just in writing this time.

813
00:43:08,874 --> 00:43:11,659
I see that. I thought we were okay.

814
00:43:12,826 --> 00:43:15,789
We are.
- Then why is it in writing this time?

815
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:18,005
So that there's no
confusion down the road.

816
00:43:24,556 --> 00:43:26,688
Just get it back to me, okay?

817
00:43:44,108 --> 00:43:46,118
You forget to hit me up
for a campaign contribution?

818
00:43:46,219 --> 00:43:49,423
That fed in the clubhouse,
how close is she to the truth?

819
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:52,858
Agent Murray's looking
to take down the cartel.

820
00:43:53,559 --> 00:43:56,776
Connecting Pezuela to them is
just a win-Win for all of us.

821
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,072
Yeah, well, I thought I'd
seen her name somewhere before.

822
00:43:59,107 --> 00:44:01,079
Tonight, I confirmed it.

823
00:44:06,446 --> 00:44:08,146
She's in the blackmail box?

824
00:44:08,398 --> 00:44:12,322
Which means the face of your plan's
crucial next step is on the hook to Pezuela.

825
00:44:16,074 --> 00:44:18,077
How much have you told her?

826
00:44:19,184 --> 00:44:21,394
Hey. He's got her in his pocket.

827
00:44:21,645 --> 00:44:23,865
How much have you told her?

828
00:44:27,225 --> 00:44:28,536
Enough to blow it
with Pezuela...

829
00:44:30,287 --> 00:44:32,137
and get us both killed.
