1
00:00:01,959 --> 00:00:02,926
I'm resigning,

2
00:00:02,992 --> 00:00:04,492
so it's kiss-my-ass time.

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:06,193
This is still my campaign.

4
00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:08,492
Mr. Mayor,
the dick is up your ass,

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,992
and I am the one
who decides when it comes out.

6
00:00:11,059 --> 00:00:13,592
Pezuela's verbal beat-down
was for this guy's benefit.

7
00:00:13,659 --> 00:00:16,959
I'm guessing your intel about
a cartel evaluator was dead-on.

8
00:00:17,026 --> 00:00:18,293
A guillermo beltran...

9
00:00:18,358 --> 00:00:19,492
no wonder Pezuela
was trying to impress him.

10
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:20,992
His boss is in town.

11
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:22,392
You heard Vic turned in
his badge yesterday?

12
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:25,425
That leaves me to be
your most important instrument

13
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:27,692
in the gurrero cartel
investigation.

14
00:00:27,759 --> 00:00:29,458
If you're no longer valuable
to Pezuela,

15
00:00:29,525 --> 00:00:31,592
we're not sure you're valuable
to this investigation.

16
00:00:31,659 --> 00:00:33,725
I'm looking for a place
to hide $100,000

17
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:35,293
where Vic won't find it.

18
00:00:35,358 --> 00:00:37,592
Why does Vendrell
want you dead?

19
00:00:37,659 --> 00:00:40,293
Vic thinks that Shane was
waiting at his place last night.

20
00:00:40,358 --> 00:00:44,358
Shane Vendrell hired you
to kill Gardocki?

21
00:00:44,425 --> 00:00:45,625
Mackey!

22
00:00:46,992 --> 00:00:48,126
What happened to Shane?

23
00:00:48,193 --> 00:00:49,293
He just left!

24
00:00:49,358 --> 00:00:50,725
Every law-enforcement agency

25
00:00:50,792 --> 00:00:53,126
statewide has a description
of Vendrell's vehicles

26
00:00:53,193 --> 00:00:54,725
and recent pictures
of the family.

27
00:00:54,792 --> 00:00:56,159
Shane and I
are getting out of town.

28
00:00:56,226 --> 00:00:57,792
I am gonna call from wherever
we are and check in.

29
00:00:57,859 --> 00:01:00,226
Vic and Ronnie are gonna do
everything in their power

30
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:01,959
to prevent the cops
from finding us.

31
00:01:02,026 --> 00:01:04,226
We got to find them
before anyone else does.

32
00:01:05,992 --> 00:01:08,126
That man over there
has a gun!

33
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:11,759
Vic tried to kill us
tonight, and you helped him.

34
00:01:11,826 --> 00:01:14,325
When I call you tomorrow,
you need to have information

35
00:01:14,392 --> 00:01:16,458
on how and where the police
are looking for us.

36
00:01:16,525 --> 00:01:17,792
What did she say?

37
00:01:17,859 --> 00:01:21,392
That they're not going to be
calling back here ever.

38
00:01:51,725 --> 00:01:52,926
Who the hell are you?

39
00:01:52,992 --> 00:01:54,559
Tell stella
we're here to see her.

40
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:55,859
Oh, she's asleep,

41
00:01:55,926 --> 00:01:57,725
being the middle
of the goddamn night and all.

42
00:01:57,792 --> 00:01:59,425
We're old friends
of her daughter's.

43
00:02:03,892 --> 00:02:05,492
Well, I haven't seen Mara.

44
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:08,992
Since you boys drove
all the way from Los Angeles,

45
00:02:09,059 --> 00:02:10,725
can I get you a drink?

46
00:02:10,792 --> 00:02:12,725
The local police have
already been through here.

47
00:02:12,792 --> 00:02:14,126
Stella told them
everything.

48
00:02:14,193 --> 00:02:16,859
Why don't you pour yourself
a turpentine martini

49
00:02:16,926 --> 00:02:17,892
and give us some air?

50
00:02:23,293 --> 00:02:25,092
The last time I saw you,

51
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:27,759
my daughter got herself
in some trouble,

52
00:02:27,826 --> 00:02:30,392
and you weren't
real nice about it, Vic.

53
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:33,126
Yeah, well, Mara's got herself
in an even worse jam.

54
00:02:33,193 --> 00:02:35,725
You have any idea where
she and Shane might be headed?

55
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:42,392
Keeping your mouth shut
means you're aiding a fugitive.

56
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:44,625
You made that sound
so official.

57
00:02:44,692 --> 00:02:48,026
It just doesn't seem legit,
though,

58
00:02:48,092 --> 00:02:49,826
this whole midnight drop-by.

59
00:02:51,358 --> 00:02:53,926
And I don't know shit
about where Mara's gone to.

60
00:02:53,992 --> 00:02:55,892
Shane's dangerous.

61
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:59,259
It's not safe for Mara out there
or for Jackson.

62
00:02:59,325 --> 00:03:01,159
And her pregnancy
could be in jeopardy.

63
00:03:01,226 --> 00:03:02,592
Pregnancy?

64
00:03:02,659 --> 00:03:07,026
Oh, well, this is a real fun way
to get the happy news.

65
00:03:07,092 --> 00:03:09,659
Stella, how long has it been since
Mara's been in touch with you?

66
00:03:09,725 --> 00:03:12,259
I stopped keeping track.

67
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:14,625
She used to help me out
with money,

68
00:03:14,692 --> 00:03:17,226
and when she got married,
that all changed.

69
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:25,193
But if you find her,

70
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:27,826
you tell her I'm happy for her
with that baby.

71
00:03:27,892 --> 00:03:31,559
Yeah, I'll be real sure
to do that.

72
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:36,525
Uh, give me a red bull.

73
00:03:36,592 --> 00:03:38,792
Nice crowd for after-hours,
santi.

74
00:03:40,425 --> 00:03:42,592
Tip well, and they leave
the lights on for you.

75
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:44,692
You're in the wrong side
of town, ain't you?

76
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:46,759
I'm here to give you
a reason to celebrate.

77
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:48,725
Name's Vendrell.

78
00:03:48,792 --> 00:03:52,525
There's a reward waiting
for anyone who can deliver him.

79
00:03:52,592 --> 00:03:55,792
Now, 10 grand... that'll buy you
an awful lot of cervezas.

80
00:03:55,859 --> 00:04:00,592
You or any of your boys find
Vendrell, you hold him for me.

81
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:03,259
But be careful.
He's an ex-cop.

82
00:04:03,325 --> 00:04:05,059
Call me at that number.

83
00:04:05,126 --> 00:04:08,926
I show up with the money,
and we make the exchange.

84
00:04:08,992 --> 00:04:12,759
This gonna get us into any shit
with your pals in blue?

85
00:04:12,826 --> 00:04:15,193
It'll stay just between
you and me,

86
00:04:15,259 --> 00:04:17,525
but I've already got
a few other search parties

87
00:04:17,592 --> 00:04:18,959
after that cash,

88
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:21,492
so there will only be
one winning lottery ticket.

89
00:04:21,559 --> 00:04:23,092
Keep it.

90
00:04:23,159 --> 00:04:27,293
I'm not feeling very sentimental
these days.

91
00:04:29,159 --> 00:04:31,059
Mara?

92
00:04:31,126 --> 00:04:32,826
Mara?

93
00:04:50,892 --> 00:04:51,792
Hey, buddy.

94
00:04:54,492 --> 00:04:55,859
Mara?

95
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,458
Water warm?

96
00:05:18,525 --> 00:05:19,926
Mmm.

97
00:05:22,126 --> 00:05:23,859
It helps my back.

98
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:28,425
Want to come in?

99
00:06:02,792 --> 00:06:04,392
Close your eyes.

100
00:06:09,725 --> 00:06:11,859
It's like we're
off the coast somewhere...

101
00:06:13,725 --> 00:06:15,926
...somewhere far, far away.

102
00:06:27,692 --> 00:06:30,226
Soon, baby.

103
00:06:30,293 --> 00:06:32,126
I promise.

104
00:06:32,193 --> 00:06:33,592
Soon.

105
00:06:45,692 --> 00:06:48,293
Nothing.

106
00:06:49,792 --> 00:06:52,692
All right, Shane knows we were
already onto his last motel,

107
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:56,059
so he's probably looking for
a place to crash with less eyes.

108
00:06:56,126 --> 00:06:57,759
My shift starts
in a couple hours.

109
00:06:57,826 --> 00:06:58,792
All right.

110
00:07:06,525 --> 00:07:09,458
You coming?

111
00:07:09,525 --> 00:07:11,759
We're not gonna find him.

112
00:07:13,826 --> 00:07:15,492
Sure we are.

113
00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:18,659
We're betting our freedom
on gang leaders, Vic.

114
00:07:18,725 --> 00:07:21,059
And that's
if any of them spot Shane.

115
00:07:21,126 --> 00:07:23,026
I'm turning over every rock
I can.

116
00:07:27,992 --> 00:07:29,226
I'm gonna run.

117
00:07:31,358 --> 00:07:32,826
Hey, hey,
we're not there yet.

118
00:07:32,892 --> 00:07:34,259
I call in sick to the Barn,

119
00:07:34,325 --> 00:07:37,358
be across the border
before anybody knows about it.

120
00:07:37,425 --> 00:07:38,759
It'll be a few days
before they even look for me.

121
00:07:38,826 --> 00:07:41,325
Once you flip that switch,
there's no going back.

122
00:07:41,392 --> 00:07:45,992
Iook, when they find Shane,
we're lifers in jail.

123
00:07:46,059 --> 00:07:48,725
That's why we got to
find him first.

124
00:07:48,792 --> 00:07:51,259
We had our chance.

125
00:07:51,325 --> 00:07:53,625
Hey, man,
it's just like any other case.

126
00:07:53,692 --> 00:07:56,458
Sometimes you just got to wait
until something hits.

127
00:07:56,525 --> 00:07:58,425
I can't sit in the Barn
and wait.

128
00:07:58,492 --> 00:08:00,692
If something goes down
and I don't hear about it,

129
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:02,659
all they got to do
is march across the bullpen

130
00:08:02,725 --> 00:08:03,892
and slap the cuffs on me.

131
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,659
And how's your running
gonna make me look?

132
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:10,092
You should run, too, man.

133
00:08:11,592 --> 00:08:13,026
Hey, hey...

134
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:17,358
this isn't something I haven't
thought of myself, okay?

135
00:08:17,425 --> 00:08:18,759
Then, let's go.
No!

136
00:08:18,826 --> 00:08:22,625
Let's go. No! Shane does not get to win.

137
00:08:22,692 --> 00:08:24,859
He dropped the grenade
that killed our team,

138
00:08:24,926 --> 00:08:26,892
but he doesn't get to kill
your career,

139
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:27,992
my life with my children.

140
00:08:31,226 --> 00:08:33,425
This side gig I got going
with I.c. E...

141
00:08:33,492 --> 00:08:34,826
It's going really well.

142
00:08:34,892 --> 00:08:38,458
Now, I'm trying to insulate us
from all this shit,

143
00:08:38,525 --> 00:08:41,092
set us up with jobs
and fed badges.

144
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:44,425
Why would they want to
bail us out, Vic?

145
00:08:44,492 --> 00:08:47,425
Me helping out Olivia...
it's got her in my corner,

146
00:08:47,492 --> 00:08:49,792
and she's whispering
in all the right ears.

147
00:08:49,859 --> 00:08:51,859
All I got to do
is nail this shithead Mexican.

148
00:08:51,926 --> 00:08:53,325
What, Pezuela?

149
00:08:53,392 --> 00:08:54,692
Not Pezuela.

150
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:57,926
His boss, his cartel guy.

151
00:08:57,992 --> 00:09:00,026
When that mousetrap springs,

152
00:09:00,092 --> 00:09:03,293
I'll tell I.c.E. That it's time
for them to cut us a deal.

153
00:09:03,358 --> 00:09:05,692
And you think
they'll go for that.

154
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:07,826
All I need is two,
three more days.

155
00:09:07,892 --> 00:09:10,926
We keep looking for Shane,
or he stays hidden that long.

156
00:09:10,992 --> 00:09:12,725
I turn it up a notch
with Olivia,

157
00:09:12,792 --> 00:09:15,226
and then I toss your name in
when she starts talking terms.

158
00:09:17,792 --> 00:09:23,026
Give me one last shot
at getting us through this shit.

159
00:09:23,092 --> 00:09:26,759
If I fail, we'll both run.

160
00:09:35,226 --> 00:09:38,026
* stay *

161
00:09:48,525 --> 00:09:49,592
mom?

162
00:09:55,059 --> 00:09:56,293
What's wrong?

163
00:09:56,358 --> 00:09:58,792
Megan had a bad dream.
Didn't you hear her crying?

164
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:01,892
Uh, okay.

165
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:05,059
Um, go back to bed.

166
00:10:07,026 --> 00:10:08,325
Come on.

167
00:10:08,392 --> 00:10:11,226
You've got school
in the morning.

168
00:10:11,293 --> 00:10:13,392
Come on.

169
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:14,959
It's ready.

170
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,425
Uh, nurse Mackey,

171
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:21,559
we're here about that
assault victim you called in.

172
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,392
Can you cover my beds for me?

173
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:24,592
Thanks, barb.

174
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:34,826
Before I say anything,
I need to be sure

175
00:10:34,892 --> 00:10:36,792
that I can't get
into trouble for this.

176
00:10:36,859 --> 00:10:38,525
Vic cannot know
that I came to you.

177
00:10:38,592 --> 00:10:40,892
Anything you say
pertaining to this investigation

178
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,026
is protected.

179
00:10:42,092 --> 00:10:43,293
You have my word.

180
00:10:43,358 --> 00:10:45,159
No, I'm gonna need it
in writing.

181
00:10:45,226 --> 00:10:46,826
I want my lawyer
to review it.

182
00:10:46,892 --> 00:10:48,425
Corrine, it's us.

183
00:10:48,492 --> 00:10:50,592
Just have the papers drawn up
and be back here in two hours.

184
00:10:50,659 --> 00:10:51,859
What's the rush?

185
00:10:51,926 --> 00:10:53,226
Is Vic planning something?

186
00:10:53,293 --> 00:10:54,659
No, just be back here
in two hours.

187
00:10:54,725 --> 00:10:55,826
Okay, Corrine,

188
00:10:55,892 --> 00:10:57,692
we'll draw up
whatever documents you want,

189
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:59,126
but we're gonna need to know

190
00:10:59,193 --> 00:11:00,725
what we're dealing with
right now.

191
00:11:00,792 --> 00:11:01,659
Oh, God.

192
00:11:07,325 --> 00:11:10,059
Shane and Mara contacted me.

193
00:11:10,126 --> 00:11:12,992
They wanted information
about the police search.

194
00:11:13,059 --> 00:11:15,358
Vic convinced me to go along
with it.

195
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:19,425
He lied to me, and he used me
to try to kill them.

196
00:11:19,492 --> 00:11:22,859
I need Vic out of my life
for good,

197
00:11:22,926 --> 00:11:28,592
but my kids cannot know
that I did this to him.

198
00:11:31,826 --> 00:11:34,859
Arrest her and find out
what she knows in interrogation.

199
00:11:34,926 --> 00:11:37,193
We arrest Corrine Mackey,

200
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:39,892
that leaves us limited
and dated information on Shane.

201
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:42,458
Now, we work with her,
that allows us to get to him.

202
00:11:42,525 --> 00:11:45,559
She's admitted to having
regular contact with a fugitive.

203
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,358
She could be forced to cooperate
after being charged.

204
00:11:47,425 --> 00:11:48,525
Corrine's only trying
to get free

205
00:11:48,592 --> 00:11:50,293
from the web
that Vic has spun.

206
00:11:50,358 --> 00:11:52,259
Now, she didn't have to
come forward.

207
00:11:52,325 --> 00:11:53,792
We owe her.

208
00:11:53,859 --> 00:11:56,725
Not to mention this could close
the book on Vic Mackey for good,

209
00:11:56,792 --> 00:11:59,525
something that should
have been done a long time ago.

210
00:11:59,592 --> 00:12:01,892
I gave Vic a pass
from time to time,

211
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:03,859
but only when he could
make a difference.

212
00:12:03,926 --> 00:12:05,059
No.

213
00:12:05,126 --> 00:12:07,458
You were sweeping him
under the rug.

214
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,293
He's made
a lot of good arrests.

215
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,226
I don't want
all those overturned.

216
00:12:16,293 --> 00:12:18,092
The crimes Corrine
can help us get Vic on

217
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:19,525
are limited
to him and Shane.

218
00:12:19,592 --> 00:12:21,159
It shouldn't jeopardize
any convictions.

219
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,826
Fine.

220
00:12:24,892 --> 00:12:26,193
Let's give her
the help she needs.

221
00:12:34,358 --> 00:12:36,959
How's early retirement?

222
00:12:37,026 --> 00:12:39,193
Turns out it's not all hawaiian
shirts and fishing trips.

223
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:40,625
Yeah,
I heard about Vendrell.

224
00:12:40,692 --> 00:12:42,892
Strike team's demise is even
more violent than I predicted.

225
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,792
End of an era,

226
00:12:44,859 --> 00:12:46,759
but I'm already looking forward
to a new one.

227
00:12:46,826 --> 00:12:48,458
Of course.

228
00:12:48,525 --> 00:12:51,525
Vic Mackey doesn't hand over his
badge without an exit strategy.

229
00:12:51,592 --> 00:12:54,126
I'm here to warn you

230
00:12:54,193 --> 00:12:56,193
your golden parachute
might be about to rip.

231
00:12:56,259 --> 00:12:57,625
Olivia gave me
a heads-up.

232
00:12:57,692 --> 00:13:00,926
Guillermo beltran's
the new fed get.

233
00:13:00,992 --> 00:13:02,358
Really?

234
00:13:02,425 --> 00:13:04,826
Pezuela's an m.b.a.
With a dirty agenda.

235
00:13:04,892 --> 00:13:07,159
This guy beltran...
he's the real power.

236
00:13:07,226 --> 00:13:09,092
Which is why I.c.E. Needs me now
more than ever.

237
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:10,392
You think chaffee

238
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:13,892
and the lineup of budget
crunchers he answers to

239
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:17,725
gives a rat's ass about you,
about keeping you alive?

240
00:13:17,792 --> 00:13:19,659
The moment beltran
crossed that border,

241
00:13:19,725 --> 00:13:21,259
the rules of the game changed.

242
00:13:21,325 --> 00:13:23,659
The feds want this guy so bad
they can taste it,

243
00:13:23,725 --> 00:13:26,193
and they will not have a problem
shooting the messenger.

244
00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:27,759
Oh, I see.

245
00:13:27,826 --> 00:13:30,259
So you want me to just back off
and let you handle things

246
00:13:30,325 --> 00:13:31,625
and gobble up all the glory.

247
00:13:31,692 --> 00:13:33,159
Is that it?

248
00:13:33,226 --> 00:13:35,358
There's only gonna be room
for one guy to work, beltran,

249
00:13:35,425 --> 00:13:36,492
and that's gonna be me.

250
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:37,725
That's what I do.

251
00:13:37,792 --> 00:13:38,959
Not anymore.

252
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:41,759
You're way in over your head,
councilman.

253
00:13:41,826 --> 00:13:45,026
Working the Mexican cartel
from the inside out?

254
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,926
This isn't pushing paperwork
from the Barn to downtown.

255
00:13:48,992 --> 00:13:50,525
This is real police work.

256
00:13:50,592 --> 00:13:53,059
Pezuela's seen
your old photo album.

257
00:13:53,126 --> 00:13:56,026
He doesn't fear you,
he doesn't respect you,

258
00:13:56,092 --> 00:13:57,892
and beltran won't, either.

259
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:00,392
So do yourself
and your family a favor.

260
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:03,026
Step away from the table,
stay away from me,

261
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,126
and let the real men
finish this job.

262
00:14:08,725 --> 00:14:10,859
Eat one of those hot dogs.

263
00:14:10,926 --> 00:14:12,392
You know, baby...

264
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:13,959
yeah?

265
00:14:14,026 --> 00:14:16,826
...it might be kind of nice
to find a place on the coast.

266
00:14:16,892 --> 00:14:19,425
Mmm, I'd like that.

267
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:21,458
Hey, buddy, you ready?

268
00:14:21,525 --> 00:14:23,159
Yeah.
Watch this.

269
00:14:24,392 --> 00:14:25,892
Oh!

270
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:30,226
You see that?
You see what daddy's doing?

271
00:14:30,293 --> 00:14:31,126
Yeah?

272
00:14:33,826 --> 00:14:35,859
Bet you a hundred grand
could get us a place

273
00:14:35,926 --> 00:14:36,992
even bigger than this.

274
00:14:37,059 --> 00:14:39,692
You know what?

275
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:42,126
I bet you're right.

276
00:14:42,193 --> 00:14:45,026
You gonna cook for me every day
down in Colombia, too?

277
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:50,193
No, I am going to hire us
a personal chef

278
00:14:50,259 --> 00:14:54,293
to make us breakfast in bed
every single morning.

279
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:58,625
I love you.

280
00:15:00,659 --> 00:15:02,892
I love you.

281
00:15:04,725 --> 00:15:07,126
All right,
daddy's gonna make his.

282
00:15:07,193 --> 00:15:08,092
Mmm.

283
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:10,559
Okay, scoot over, buddy.

284
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:12,193
Come on.

285
00:15:26,193 --> 00:15:27,425
Claro que sí, como no.

286
00:15:30,826 --> 00:15:32,392
Did we have a meeting?

287
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:33,992
Think of this as roll call.

288
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:37,059
I'm clocked in
and ready for work.

289
00:15:37,126 --> 00:15:39,592
If I need you,
I'll call you.

290
00:15:39,659 --> 00:15:43,059
Well, I've had some extra time
on my hands lately,

291
00:15:43,126 --> 00:15:45,926
thought I could keep busy
for the cause,

292
00:15:45,992 --> 00:15:47,992
but, hell,
I get paid either way.

293
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:53,592
Haven't had the pleasure.
I'm Vic Mackey.

294
00:15:53,659 --> 00:15:56,625
El es el policía anterior
sobre que te dije.

295
00:15:56,692 --> 00:15:59,325
That's right.
I was a cop.

296
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:01,725
But now
I'm more of a favor granter.

297
00:16:01,792 --> 00:16:04,425
What kind of favors?

298
00:16:04,492 --> 00:16:08,525
I specialize
in the hard-to-deliver kind.

299
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,126
I guess you're a good guy
to know.

300
00:16:10,193 --> 00:16:12,859
No, I'm not a real...

301
00:16:17,259 --> 00:16:19,293
Vic Mackey.
Didn't expect to find you here.

302
00:16:19,358 --> 00:16:21,226
So, are you
making new friends?

303
00:16:21,293 --> 00:16:22,592
How do you know Cruz?

304
00:16:22,659 --> 00:16:25,458
Just finishing some paperwork
on an old case.

305
00:16:25,525 --> 00:16:28,059
What are you doing here,
David?

306
00:16:28,126 --> 00:16:30,126
Well, you and I
need to talk...

307
00:16:30,193 --> 00:16:31,159
in private.

308
00:16:31,226 --> 00:16:33,026
Come back later.

309
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:35,293
Now, if you and I are gonna
continue in this arrangement,

310
00:16:35,358 --> 00:16:38,092
then I need a course correction that
includes a restatement of my terms.

311
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:40,092
You don't get terms.
You get to be mayor.

312
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:41,293
Oh, I know.

313
00:16:41,358 --> 00:16:43,059
But that'll be
with or without you.

314
00:16:43,126 --> 00:16:44,692
I'm still deciding which.

315
00:16:46,859 --> 00:16:48,892
Well, do you mind
giving us a hint

316
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,759
as to which way
you're leaning?

317
00:16:50,826 --> 00:16:53,259
From now on...

318
00:16:53,325 --> 00:16:56,325
you don't make any decisions
regarding my campaign,

319
00:16:56,392 --> 00:16:58,026
who I work with,
or where I work out of.

320
00:16:58,092 --> 00:16:59,992
¿entiendes?

321
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:03,392
I don't care how much you
or your investors contribute.

322
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,992
You are
my goddamned errand boy,

323
00:17:08,059 --> 00:17:10,859
and you will do exactly
as you're told!

324
00:17:10,926 --> 00:17:12,259
You're an empty suit.

325
00:17:12,325 --> 00:17:14,358
You're a checkbook,
nothing more.

326
00:17:14,425 --> 00:17:16,892
And just because
you hang out with tough guys

327
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,358
doesn't make you tough.

328
00:17:42,492 --> 00:17:44,092
David.
Get back!

329
00:17:44,159 --> 00:17:46,559
Get back, Vic.

330
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:49,592
You assaulted
a reserve police officer,

331
00:17:49,659 --> 00:17:51,059
and that's a felony.

332
00:17:51,126 --> 00:17:53,293
You have made
a very big mistake.

333
00:17:53,358 --> 00:17:54,926
The only mistake I made

334
00:17:54,992 --> 00:17:58,092
was letting you think
that I was your errand boy.

335
00:17:58,159 --> 00:17:59,525
It's still
the other way around.

336
00:18:20,826 --> 00:18:22,859
What the hell was that?!

337
00:18:22,926 --> 00:18:24,826
I just proved my point.

338
00:18:24,892 --> 00:18:26,759
You just blew
that I.c.E. Investigation

339
00:18:26,826 --> 00:18:28,126
right out the window.

340
00:18:28,193 --> 00:18:30,293
The one you're so desperate
to stay relevant to, huh?

341
00:18:30,358 --> 00:18:31,659
By taking on the cartel,

342
00:18:31,725 --> 00:18:33,959
you've opened yourself
to a world of possibilities,

343
00:18:34,026 --> 00:18:35,193
all of them bad!

344
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,759
You're gonna
get yourself killed.

345
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,226
You know, beltran just saw
the same thing you just saw,

346
00:18:41,293 --> 00:18:43,692
which means I'm gonna deal
with him directly from now on.

347
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:45,425
So, if you're
still fantasizing

348
00:18:45,492 --> 00:18:47,759
about being I.c.E.'s connection
to the cartel,

349
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:49,592
well, you better get yourself
a new gig.

350
00:19:03,926 --> 00:19:06,226
Here you go, captain.
Would you like me to stay?

351
00:19:06,293 --> 00:19:07,692
I'm fine.
Thank you.

352
00:19:14,425 --> 00:19:17,358
Mara came to see me
a few nights ago.

353
00:19:17,425 --> 00:19:21,293
She claims that Vic and Ronnie
tried to kill Shane,

354
00:19:21,358 --> 00:19:23,926
something having to do
with the armenians.

355
00:19:23,992 --> 00:19:26,358
And Mara asked you
to help her and Shane

356
00:19:26,425 --> 00:19:28,492
get police information
regarding them as fugitives?

357
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,059
Vic thought
it would be best

358
00:19:30,126 --> 00:19:31,992
if Shane and Mara
left the country,

359
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:34,992
that it would be better
for all of us if they got away.

360
00:19:35,059 --> 00:19:37,559
Instead, he tried
to track them down himself?

361
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:39,992
Did Ronnie have anything to do
with this hunt?

362
00:19:40,059 --> 00:19:42,159
I don't know if Ronnie
helped him or not.

363
00:19:42,226 --> 00:19:43,926
How did Vic find Shane?

364
00:19:43,992 --> 00:19:47,092
He asked me about medication
that Jackson was taking.

365
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:50,126
Mara called me to say
that Vic had tracked them down

366
00:19:50,193 --> 00:19:52,059
last night,
tried to kill them.

367
00:19:52,126 --> 00:19:55,293
She's pregnant,
for God sakes.

368
00:19:55,358 --> 00:19:59,926
I never liked her,
but she didn't deserve this.

369
00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:03,092
Pay Vic a visit?

370
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:04,226
Not yet.

371
00:20:04,293 --> 00:20:06,126
We've seen the hold
he's got on Corrine.

372
00:20:06,193 --> 00:20:09,059
I'm not sure she'd be willing
to repeat that in a courtroom.

373
00:20:09,126 --> 00:20:11,525
I'll use inglewood to set up
the tap on Corrine's phone.

374
00:20:11,592 --> 00:20:13,826
That way, we won't trigger
any suspicion with Ronnie.

375
00:20:13,892 --> 00:20:15,159
I'll park him with Billings

376
00:20:15,226 --> 00:20:17,059
until we know
what his involvement is.

377
00:20:17,126 --> 00:20:19,358
Steve will like that.
He's got a pretty big man crush.

378
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:24,725
I don't want inglewood
to know who this number's for.

379
00:20:24,792 --> 00:20:27,092
You never know
how far Mackey's reach goes.

380
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:29,525
You think Vic's
got that many friends left?

381
00:20:29,592 --> 00:20:30,892
Well, from here on out,

382
00:20:30,959 --> 00:20:32,692
this investigation
is between us.

383
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:35,193
...9, 10!
Ready or not, here I come!

384
00:20:36,492 --> 00:20:39,525
Where's Jackson?

385
00:20:39,592 --> 00:20:40,525
Shh.

386
00:20:40,592 --> 00:20:43,159
Where's Jackson?

387
00:20:43,226 --> 00:20:46,226
Nope, he's not in there!

388
00:20:48,892 --> 00:20:50,126
Is he over here?

389
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,792
Nope!

390
00:20:58,992 --> 00:21:00,926
I didn't know
you played the piano, baby.

391
00:21:03,392 --> 00:21:06,358
Yeah, my mom made me
take lessons when I was a kid.

392
00:21:06,425 --> 00:21:08,592
I was in class
with these four girls.

393
00:21:10,193 --> 00:21:11,792
It didn't last long.

394
00:21:11,859 --> 00:21:14,725
I was too busy
wanting to help my dad fix cars.

395
00:21:16,026 --> 00:21:17,358
Wish I would have
kept at it, though.

396
00:21:17,425 --> 00:21:18,559
Mm.

397
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,892
Where's Jackson?

398
00:21:20,959 --> 00:21:22,358
Let's see.

399
00:21:22,425 --> 00:21:24,892
There you are!

400
00:21:24,959 --> 00:21:27,159
I found you!

401
00:21:29,425 --> 00:21:31,926
Baby, look at him dance.

402
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:35,092
Come on, baby!

403
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:36,592
Show me your two-step,
little man.

404
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:38,826
Come on.

405
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,325
Come on, buddy.
Show me what you got.

406
00:21:45,792 --> 00:21:48,992
All right, I'll tell him.

407
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:51,126
Should I come back?

408
00:21:51,193 --> 00:21:52,492
What do you need, Steve?

409
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,692
I just got a call from
a detective in north Hollywood.

410
00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:58,026
He asked if we'd interview a couple
locals for him on a murder case they got.

411
00:21:58,092 --> 00:21:59,692
Oh, we're a little busy
right now.

412
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:01,559
Oh, it's just taking
a few statements,

413
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:03,059
eliminating them
as suspects.

414
00:22:03,126 --> 00:22:04,725
I figure if Dutch and I
split up,

415
00:22:04,792 --> 00:22:06,325
we can knock it out
by lunchtime.

416
00:22:06,392 --> 00:22:08,559
Grab Gardocki.

417
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:11,458
Dutch is staying with me
on Vendrell today.

418
00:22:11,525 --> 00:22:13,792
Oh, you catch a lead
on Shane?

419
00:22:13,859 --> 00:22:15,692
What's going on?
We got nothing.

420
00:22:18,892 --> 00:22:22,492
Hey, looks like you and me
are first string today.

421
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:23,859
What do you mean?

422
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,592
North Hollywood's got
a home-invasion murder.

423
00:22:25,659 --> 00:22:27,293
So?

424
00:22:27,358 --> 00:22:29,126
So, they want us
to do the interviews.

425
00:22:29,193 --> 00:22:31,492
This is a chance for you and me
to chat things up.

426
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,692
You can tell me
how you met that asian hottie.

427
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:36,992
I want to stick around here and
see what breaks on the Shane thing.

428
00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:38,625
Oh, sorry,
Claudette's orders.

429
00:22:38,692 --> 00:22:40,525
Besides,
by the time we're done,

430
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:42,725
you could be speaking
to Vendrell in person.

431
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,059
What did you hear?

432
00:22:46,126 --> 00:22:48,059
Dutch and Claudette are upstairs
playing "I got a secret,"

433
00:22:48,126 --> 00:22:49,926
but it's real enough.

434
00:22:59,293 --> 00:23:03,492
Vic and Shane
always seemed so tight.

435
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:07,092
Friendships do get tested,
I guess.

436
00:23:08,492 --> 00:23:10,392
What's he doing here?

437
00:23:18,126 --> 00:23:19,892
Mara?

438
00:23:19,959 --> 00:23:22,826
Corrine, Vic's walking
up to your front door right now.

439
00:23:22,892 --> 00:23:24,425
What do I do?

440
00:23:24,492 --> 00:23:26,193
You on a landline
or a cordless?

441
00:23:26,259 --> 00:23:27,625
Cordless.

442
00:23:27,692 --> 00:23:29,193
Good. Just set the phone down,
act like it's off,

443
00:23:29,259 --> 00:23:30,792
I'll keep the line open.

444
00:23:32,392 --> 00:23:34,926
Hi.
What are you doing here?

445
00:23:34,992 --> 00:23:36,458
It's almost 1:00.

446
00:23:36,525 --> 00:23:37,792
I know it's a long shot,

447
00:23:37,859 --> 00:23:39,959
but I thought maybe Shane
and Mara would call back.

448
00:23:40,026 --> 00:23:42,259
She said she didn't trust us.
Remember?

449
00:23:42,325 --> 00:23:43,692
She doesn't trust me.

450
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:45,792
Either way,
they're desperate.

451
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:48,092
Can I just come in
and wait around for a while?

452
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:49,026
You never know.

453
00:23:55,092 --> 00:23:58,059
Hey, the place looks nice.

454
00:23:58,126 --> 00:24:01,559
Yeah, I, uh, took advantage
of having the day off,

455
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:03,392
and I did some cleaning.

456
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:06,859
Iook, I know you never asked
to be a part of this.

457
00:24:11,525 --> 00:24:14,059
I want you to know

458
00:24:14,126 --> 00:24:17,092
I really appreciate you
pulling through for me here.

459
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:19,525
Just hang in there.

460
00:24:41,293 --> 00:24:42,892
We're gonna miss the call.

461
00:24:52,358 --> 00:24:57,059
Well, looks like
they kept their promise.

462
00:25:00,325 --> 00:25:01,759
If you hear from them,

463
00:25:01,826 --> 00:25:03,325
let me know right away,
okay?

464
00:25:03,392 --> 00:25:05,926
I will.

465
00:25:15,525 --> 00:25:16,725
Are you still there?

466
00:25:16,792 --> 00:25:18,159
Yeah, he's on his way
to his car.

467
00:25:18,226 --> 00:25:20,259
Hang up the phone.

468
00:25:31,126 --> 00:25:32,358
Hello?

469
00:25:32,425 --> 00:25:34,325
Why was the line busy,
Corrine?

470
00:25:34,392 --> 00:25:35,859
I have two autistic kids,
Mara.

471
00:25:35,926 --> 00:25:38,392
One of them knocked
the bedroom phone off the hook.

472
00:25:38,458 --> 00:25:39,525
I'm sorry.

473
00:25:39,592 --> 00:25:40,959
Tell me what you know.

474
00:25:41,026 --> 00:25:43,859
They've expanded their search
to include other precincts.

475
00:25:43,926 --> 00:25:46,892
All major throughways out of
the city are being watched.

476
00:25:46,959 --> 00:25:48,458
What else?

477
00:25:48,525 --> 00:25:51,892
They're going to release your
pictures for the evening news.

478
00:25:54,392 --> 00:25:56,592
I'll call you back at 10:00.

479
00:25:59,092 --> 00:26:01,926
Sounds like she's in.

480
00:26:14,736 --> 00:26:15,902
I got nothing yet.

481
00:26:15,969 --> 00:26:17,969
Iook at you,
beverly hills cop.

482
00:26:18,036 --> 00:26:19,736
Been a long time.

483
00:26:20,936 --> 00:26:22,502
What are Dutch
and Claudette up to?

484
00:26:22,569 --> 00:26:24,069
They've been out all day.

485
00:26:24,135 --> 00:26:26,369
I've been stuck in interrogation
with Billings.

486
00:26:26,435 --> 00:26:27,569
Something's going on,

487
00:26:27,636 --> 00:26:29,569
but I don't see
how I can find out what.

488
00:26:29,636 --> 00:26:31,969
What about Billings? Can he
get something out of Dutch?

489
00:26:32,036 --> 00:26:33,469
I'll try.

490
00:26:33,535 --> 00:26:35,069
He wants to be
my best friend.

491
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:36,969
Ask Julien, too.

492
00:26:37,036 --> 00:26:38,636
I'm not sure
what side he's on here.

493
00:26:38,702 --> 00:26:40,103
It's better than nothing.

494
00:26:41,902 --> 00:26:43,602
How's it going
with our I.c.E. Angle?

495
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:46,003
That's all looking good.

496
00:26:46,069 --> 00:26:47,902
Hey, don't treat me
like Claudette.

497
00:26:47,969 --> 00:26:49,235
What's the real deal here?

498
00:26:51,602 --> 00:26:53,535
Right now,
it's all about Aceveda.

499
00:26:53,602 --> 00:26:56,602
So, I got to get I.c.E.
To move away from him first.

500
00:26:56,669 --> 00:26:58,402
Well,
how are you gonna do that?

501
00:26:58,469 --> 00:26:59,902
With a little help
from you.

502
00:27:02,836 --> 00:27:06,702
You got a drink
you can recommend here?

503
00:27:06,769 --> 00:27:08,769
How did you know
I was here?

504
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:10,802
More mysterious
if I don't tell you.

505
00:27:10,869 --> 00:27:14,636
This conversation
will be a lot longer if you do.

506
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:20,168
Waited outside of Pezuela's
place for you to come out,

507
00:27:20,235 --> 00:27:21,902
see which car
you were driving.

508
00:27:21,969 --> 00:27:23,235
We got the plate,

509
00:27:23,302 --> 00:27:25,003
and I had a friend of mine
in the department

510
00:27:25,069 --> 00:27:26,569
put your car on a watch
and advise.

511
00:27:26,636 --> 00:27:28,103
10 minutes later,
we got a hit

512
00:27:28,168 --> 00:27:31,235
your benz was sleeping
outside in this parking lot,

513
00:27:31,302 --> 00:27:33,135
and here I am.

514
00:27:33,202 --> 00:27:35,302
You still got juice
with the police, huh?

515
00:27:35,369 --> 00:27:39,302
Enough to make a screwdriver
for every vato in I.a.

516
00:27:39,369 --> 00:27:41,202
I don't know who you are,
exactly,

517
00:27:41,268 --> 00:27:43,736
but judging by the way
Pezuela puffed up his chest

518
00:27:43,802 --> 00:27:45,369
when I first got there,

519
00:27:45,435 --> 00:27:47,936
I'd say important...

520
00:27:48,003 --> 00:27:49,702
which means you're cartel.

521
00:27:49,769 --> 00:27:51,969
Pretty high up, too.

522
00:27:52,036 --> 00:27:54,369
Can I guess
why you're here?

523
00:27:54,435 --> 00:27:57,769
Pezuela's screwing up...

524
00:27:57,836 --> 00:28:00,535
body draggings,
public assassination,

525
00:28:00,602 --> 00:28:02,535
pointing the finger
at your organization

526
00:28:02,602 --> 00:28:04,402
while he walks around
in a suit and tie,

527
00:28:04,469 --> 00:28:06,202
more interested
in his big buildings

528
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:09,202
than doing business
for you.

529
00:28:09,268 --> 00:28:11,869
Getting his ass kicked
by a politician today...

530
00:28:11,936 --> 00:28:14,168
that couldn't have inspired
much confidence.

531
00:28:17,502 --> 00:28:19,135
We don't work well
with outsiders.

532
00:28:19,202 --> 00:28:19,329
Who do you think...

533
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:23,730
He's not gonna be looking
for a dead man.

534
00:28:23,765 --> 00:28:25,535
has been cleaning up
Pezuela's mess?

535
00:28:25,602 --> 00:28:28,335
You want to prove yourself
to me?

536
00:28:28,402 --> 00:28:30,235
Try me.

537
00:28:30,302 --> 00:28:33,135
I never want to
see his face again.

538
00:28:33,202 --> 00:28:34,969
Pezuela?

539
00:28:36,869 --> 00:28:38,902
Show me the cop
washes off of you.

540
00:28:57,702 --> 00:28:59,869
Hey, hey, someone's here.

541
00:28:59,936 --> 00:29:01,769
Shit.

542
00:29:01,836 --> 00:29:03,636
Um, finish getting him dressed.

543
00:29:03,702 --> 00:29:06,168
They're not coming by
for another hour.

544
00:29:06,235 --> 00:29:09,069
I wanted to get here early
and air the place out.

545
00:29:09,135 --> 00:29:10,769
I thought I heard someone.

546
00:29:10,836 --> 00:29:13,235
Hi, I'm debbie paluf.
I'm with keller.

547
00:29:13,302 --> 00:29:15,535
You scared me. Why didn't you
leave the door open?

548
00:29:15,602 --> 00:29:17,602
Oh, I have a single dad
in there.

549
00:29:17,669 --> 00:29:21,103
He has a toddler, and he wanted
to make sure the locks worked.

550
00:29:21,168 --> 00:29:22,535
He's a very nervous guy.

551
00:29:23,969 --> 00:29:26,036
I'll call you back.

552
00:29:26,103 --> 00:29:28,435
Bill said they weren't
showing this place till 4:00.

553
00:29:28,502 --> 00:29:29,769
Oh, yeah, probably.

554
00:29:29,836 --> 00:29:32,003
I was actually showing my guy
a place over on belden

555
00:29:32,069 --> 00:29:33,769
and we drove by
and he saw the sign,

556
00:29:33,836 --> 00:29:35,168
so I called hillary gratham,

557
00:29:35,235 --> 00:29:36,636
and I asked her
for the lockbox code.

558
00:29:36,702 --> 00:29:38,769
Can I ask you a question
about the schools around here?

559
00:29:38,836 --> 00:29:40,335
Oh, hi.
Hi.

560
00:29:40,402 --> 00:29:42,469
Mr. Wilson,
apparently this house

561
00:29:42,535 --> 00:29:45,268
is being shown to another buyer
at 4:00 today.

562
00:29:45,335 --> 00:29:47,736
Ah. Well, I better make my
decision quick then, huh?

563
00:29:47,802 --> 00:29:49,669
I'm not sure
if debbie showed you already,

564
00:29:49,736 --> 00:29:51,369
but did you see
the back patio's

565
00:29:51,435 --> 00:29:55,103
been newly re-tiled
with terra-cotta and the...

566
00:29:57,335 --> 00:29:59,702
what are you?
Oh, my God.

567
00:29:59,769 --> 00:30:03,235
Take her cellphone.
Take her keys. Come on.

568
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:06,535
Don't hurt...
please don't hurt me.

569
00:30:06,602 --> 00:30:09,103
Please don't.
I beg you.

570
00:30:09,168 --> 00:30:11,369
My husband, my daughter...
just shut up already!

571
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:12,936
Just shut up!
Aah!

572
00:30:14,802 --> 00:30:16,535
Hey,
how's the Shane thing coming?

573
00:30:16,602 --> 00:30:19,235
Hard, like trying to find
a needle in 10 haystacks.

574
00:30:20,769 --> 00:30:24,802
Dutch, so, you think
that Shane's still in I.a.

575
00:30:24,869 --> 00:30:27,435
Like I said, Steve,
we got nothing.

576
00:30:33,502 --> 00:30:37,036
A realtor was forcibly detained
by an armed man and woman

577
00:30:37,103 --> 00:30:40,268
when she found them squatting
in one of her homes.

578
00:30:40,335 --> 00:30:42,402
They locked her in a pantry
before escaping in her car...

579
00:30:42,469 --> 00:30:43,702
Shane and Mara.

580
00:30:43,769 --> 00:30:44,702
Where?

581
00:30:44,769 --> 00:30:46,335
Los feliz.

582
00:30:46,402 --> 00:30:48,069
Unis say she was locked up
for about an hour

583
00:30:48,135 --> 00:30:50,135
before another realtor
arrived with clients.

584
00:30:50,202 --> 00:30:51,535
I'll call their captain

585
00:30:51,602 --> 00:30:53,469
and see can he quietly
get a few cars over there.

586
00:30:53,535 --> 00:30:56,103
We should pull a few of ours,
as well, get them all in there.

587
00:30:56,168 --> 00:30:57,502
Right, right, right.

588
00:30:59,636 --> 00:31:01,602
Julien, you got a second?

589
00:31:01,669 --> 00:31:03,669
Sure. What's up?

590
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:07,268
I need you to issue a message
on the m.d.t.

591
00:31:10,135 --> 00:31:11,802
This about Vendrell?

592
00:31:11,869 --> 00:31:15,569
Yeah, and I don't want it
to go out on the radio.

593
00:31:25,936 --> 00:31:28,402
Beltran gave me
my first task today.

594
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:31,836
Apparently, he's not happy
with your job performance.

595
00:31:31,902 --> 00:31:33,602
He sent me to kill you.

596
00:31:38,036 --> 00:31:41,268
Lucky for you,
we don't play on the same team.

597
00:31:41,335 --> 00:31:43,435
I work for Olivia Murray.

598
00:31:45,168 --> 00:31:46,802
That's right.

599
00:31:46,869 --> 00:31:49,402
Agent Murray
has a few questions for you,

600
00:31:49,469 --> 00:31:50,836
asked if I could
bring you in.

601
00:31:50,902 --> 00:31:53,135
I'm gonna need you
to give me back her file

602
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:55,003
before we head over there.

603
00:31:55,069 --> 00:31:56,402
That file's all I got
on that bitch.

604
00:31:56,469 --> 00:31:57,936
That bitch will send you
out on the street

605
00:31:58,003 --> 00:32:02,936
at the cartel's mercy
if I tell her to.

606
00:32:03,003 --> 00:32:05,802
You're about to get something
that nobody ever gets...

607
00:32:05,869 --> 00:32:07,469
a second chance.

608
00:32:09,669 --> 00:32:11,902
For a guy who could be facedown
in the I.a. River,

609
00:32:11,969 --> 00:32:13,335
you don't seem
very cooperative.

610
00:32:13,402 --> 00:32:14,769
You were green-lit, Cruz.

611
00:32:14,836 --> 00:32:17,069
You understand how lucky you are
that beltran gave the hit

612
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:19,335
to a guy who was
working undercover for us?

613
00:32:19,402 --> 00:32:23,036
If beltran wants me dead,
I'm dead.

614
00:32:23,103 --> 00:32:26,202
If I talk, it just gives him
more incentive to find me.

615
00:32:26,268 --> 00:32:28,302
How are you gonna protect me
from that?

616
00:32:28,369 --> 00:32:29,836
We'll give you
a new life.

617
00:32:29,902 --> 00:32:32,202
What's that?

618
00:32:32,268 --> 00:32:35,103
A townhouse in phoenix?

619
00:32:35,168 --> 00:32:38,103
No, thanks.

620
00:32:39,502 --> 00:32:41,469
Why don't you give
your boss a ring,

621
00:32:41,535 --> 00:32:44,135
tell him it looks like
we're gonna be here for a while?

622
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,335
Well done.

623
00:32:52,402 --> 00:32:55,003
You keep stonewalling like this
for the next couple of days,

624
00:32:55,069 --> 00:32:57,602
I promise you I will deliver
beltran to them myself.

625
00:32:57,669 --> 00:32:59,836
You walk out of this
without a scratch.

626
00:32:59,902 --> 00:33:02,736
Beltran will never stop
looking for me.

627
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:12,464
It's gonna be a slow go,

628
00:33:12,531 --> 00:33:13,930
but Pezuela will talk
eventually.

629
00:33:13,997 --> 00:33:15,298
How long before he starts
talking about my file?

630
00:33:15,364 --> 00:33:16,665
Don't worry.

631
00:33:16,731 --> 00:33:19,131
I'm headed over to his place
right now to get the box.

632
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:21,765
We have to convince beltran
that I took out Pezuela.

633
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:24,498
That way
I'll have earned my keep.

634
00:33:24,564 --> 00:33:26,897
Me becoming the new Pezuela...

635
00:33:26,964 --> 00:33:28,997
your bosses aren't gonna
get any closer than that.

636
00:33:29,064 --> 00:33:31,031
They're content to use David.

637
00:33:31,097 --> 00:33:35,097
Sure, maybe David can clue you
in on beltran's master plan.

638
00:33:35,164 --> 00:33:36,864
What plan?

639
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:39,464
Well, from the little beltran
clued me in on this afternoon

640
00:33:39,531 --> 00:33:41,031
when I spoke to him,

641
00:33:41,097 --> 00:33:43,231
it sounds like he's starting up
a money-laundering scheme

642
00:33:43,298 --> 00:33:44,997
that would make
ivan boesky flinch.

643
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:48,031
But you can get the details
from your boy Aceveda.

644
00:33:48,097 --> 00:33:50,031
Okay.

645
00:33:50,097 --> 00:33:53,197
Let me make
another phone call.

646
00:33:54,564 --> 00:33:56,531
What's that?

647
00:33:56,598 --> 00:33:58,930
This is a police scanner.

648
00:33:58,997 --> 00:34:01,897
That way, we can at least have
some ears on their movement.

649
00:34:01,964 --> 00:34:04,331
Baby, I think
we should get out of California.

650
00:34:04,398 --> 00:34:06,031
No, not yet.

651
00:34:06,097 --> 00:34:07,897
It's gonna take
a lot of manpower

652
00:34:07,964 --> 00:34:09,665
to check
all those empty homes.

653
00:34:09,731 --> 00:34:12,930
It should keep them busy
until the motorcade hits town.

654
00:34:12,997 --> 00:34:16,498
So, all we've got to do
is make it through tomorrow,

655
00:34:16,564 --> 00:34:17,897
and we'll be in the clear.

656
00:34:17,964 --> 00:34:21,731
And I know a place where
we can stay in the meantime.

657
00:34:23,064 --> 00:34:25,464
I'm guessing it probably
doesn't have a pool.

658
00:34:28,264 --> 00:34:31,631
You know,
there was a minute today

659
00:34:31,698 --> 00:34:34,631
when you were playing piano
and Jackson was dancing,

660
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:36,097
I actually...

661
00:34:36,164 --> 00:34:39,331
I actually forgot about
everything that was going on,

662
00:34:39,398 --> 00:34:41,364
and I was just...
I was just happy.

663
00:34:43,964 --> 00:34:46,164
Every day's gonna be
like that in Colombia, babe.

664
00:34:46,231 --> 00:34:47,298
Yeah.

665
00:34:47,364 --> 00:34:48,864
I promise, okay?

666
00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:51,231
Now, what's going on
with the little man?

667
00:34:51,298 --> 00:34:53,264
He's hungry.

668
00:34:53,331 --> 00:34:56,164
Well, I'm pretty sure
I can fix that.

669
00:34:59,064 --> 00:35:01,164
I have some sad news
for you.

670
00:35:01,231 --> 00:35:04,164
A colleague of yours
committed suicide tonight,

671
00:35:04,231 --> 00:35:06,598
blew his brains out
in his office.

672
00:35:06,665 --> 00:35:08,964
You'll be reading about it
in tomorrow's paper.

673
00:35:13,131 --> 00:35:15,964
And how do the policia
know it's a suicide?

674
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:17,797
Because the gun in his hand

675
00:35:17,864 --> 00:35:20,997
is gonna match the bullet
they find in his brain.

676
00:35:21,064 --> 00:35:24,531
An assortment of alcohol
and drugs will seal the deal.

677
00:35:24,598 --> 00:35:26,598
It means there won't be
any investigation.

678
00:35:26,665 --> 00:35:28,097
Now, if I'm not mistaken,

679
00:35:28,164 --> 00:35:30,864
that means there will be a hole
in your organization.

680
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:33,930
Where do I submit
an application?

681
00:35:39,231 --> 00:35:40,997
Sorry, buddy.

682
00:35:43,897 --> 00:35:45,498
La placa.

683
00:35:45,564 --> 00:35:47,231
Aquí busca sandy.

684
00:35:47,298 --> 00:35:49,131
That's that punk right there.
That's him.

685
00:35:57,064 --> 00:35:58,231
Hold up there, homes.

686
00:35:58,298 --> 00:36:00,731
Whoa, hey, whoa.
Fellas, I'm a cop.

687
00:36:00,797 --> 00:36:04,064
Not no more.
Grab his heat, dawg.

688
00:36:04,131 --> 00:36:05,598
Shane, what's going on?

689
00:36:05,665 --> 00:36:08,097
It's okay, baby.
I got it.

690
00:36:08,164 --> 00:36:10,164
Hey, hey, man, hey.
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

691
00:36:10,231 --> 00:36:11,564
Bitch, get out the car.

692
00:36:11,631 --> 00:36:13,964
Man, she's got my kid in there,
all right?

693
00:36:14,031 --> 00:36:16,364
No, no, no, no, no.

694
00:36:16,431 --> 00:36:19,731
Hey, call santi.
Tell him we got his guy.

695
00:36:19,797 --> 00:36:22,131
Hey, homey, you must have really
pissed off your cop buddy.

696
00:36:22,197 --> 00:36:24,830
He's paying 10 g's
for your head, esé.

697
00:36:24,897 --> 00:36:27,830
Hey, look, man,
before you make that call,

698
00:36:27,897 --> 00:36:30,197
maybe we can do
some business ourselves.

699
00:36:30,264 --> 00:36:31,698
Unless you got 10 grand,

700
00:36:31,765 --> 00:36:34,464
the only business we got
is selling your ass.

701
00:36:34,531 --> 00:36:36,964
Well, today's your lucky day,
'cause I... I got 20.

702
00:36:37,031 --> 00:36:39,665
That's the easiest cash
you boys will ever make.

703
00:36:39,731 --> 00:36:42,765
It's 10 grand apiece. All
you got to do is keep walking.

704
00:36:46,331 --> 00:36:48,331
You carry
that kind of green?

705
00:36:48,398 --> 00:36:52,498
If I do,
does that mean we got a deal?

706
00:36:52,564 --> 00:36:56,364
You walk away.
You leave my wife and my kid.

707
00:36:56,431 --> 00:36:59,364
You leave us alone.

708
00:36:59,431 --> 00:37:01,031
Sure, let's see it.

709
00:37:03,164 --> 00:37:04,930
Mara, get the money.

710
00:37:04,997 --> 00:37:06,698
Go ahead, baby.

711
00:37:15,631 --> 00:37:17,698
That's all you got
in the bag.

712
00:37:17,765 --> 00:37:19,531
Come on, man.
I thought we were straight.

713
00:37:22,431 --> 00:37:24,364
Oh, shit.

714
00:37:24,431 --> 00:37:26,131
Homey,
there's more than 10 g's...

715
00:37:26,197 --> 00:37:27,830
come on, man!
We had a goddamn...

716
00:37:27,897 --> 00:37:29,964
that's before you were rich,
white boy.

717
00:37:30,031 --> 00:37:31,164
All right, fine.

718
00:37:31,231 --> 00:37:33,131
Fine, you got almost 100 grand
in there.

719
00:37:33,197 --> 00:37:34,997
That's more than enough
to keep walking.

720
00:37:36,498 --> 00:37:39,197
Why walk away with 100
when I could walk away with 110?

721
00:37:39,264 --> 00:37:41,731
A cop is looking for me.

722
00:37:41,797 --> 00:37:43,498
First thing he does when
he gets here is flash a badge,

723
00:37:43,564 --> 00:37:44,897
and he takes that money.

724
00:37:44,964 --> 00:37:46,064
Trust me.

725
00:37:46,131 --> 00:37:47,598
Iook, you got two choices.

726
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:52,031
You can take the $98,000 and
change that you got right there,

727
00:37:52,097 --> 00:37:54,531
or you make that call

728
00:37:54,598 --> 00:37:57,364
and you see how much
you walk away with then.

729
00:38:29,004 --> 00:38:30,704
Just wanted
to let you know

730
00:38:30,771 --> 00:38:32,604
that Pezuela
killed himself tonight.

731
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:36,437
Really?

732
00:38:36,504 --> 00:38:37,804
Didn't seem the type.

733
00:38:37,871 --> 00:38:40,104
You know, I've been following
your career, councilman.

734
00:38:40,171 --> 00:38:42,837
You're like a fish
swimming through razor blades.

735
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:44,204
I'm impressed.

736
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:46,270
I'm glad you approve.

737
00:38:46,337 --> 00:38:48,238
Relájate, man, relax.

738
00:38:48,303 --> 00:38:50,937
I'm not like Cruz.
I don't like to micromanage.

739
00:38:51,004 --> 00:38:53,804
I like to stay focused
on the bigger picture.

740
00:38:53,871 --> 00:38:55,403
Besides,
you're the politician here.

741
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:57,138
You can decide
how to run your campaign.

742
00:38:57,204 --> 00:39:00,403
Hire who you want,
target the areas you want,

743
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:01,937
focus on the issues
you want.

744
00:39:02,004 --> 00:39:04,871
Just don't lose.

745
00:39:04,937 --> 00:39:06,504
I won't.

746
00:39:10,071 --> 00:39:12,238
The fruit growers union
are going to be announcing

747
00:39:12,303 --> 00:39:13,937
their formal support
for your campaign.

748
00:39:14,004 --> 00:39:16,504
You know those campesinos.

749
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:19,370
They need a place
to keep their earnings.

750
00:39:19,437 --> 00:39:22,570
And immigrants...
we don't...

751
00:39:22,637 --> 00:39:24,370
we don't trust
American banks.

752
00:39:24,437 --> 00:39:25,837
And I have a suggestion

753
00:39:25,904 --> 00:39:28,171
which would be beneficial
to all of us.

754
00:39:28,238 --> 00:39:29,871
But that's for later.

755
00:39:32,637 --> 00:39:37,537
Well, great, I look forward
to their support and yours.

756
00:40:00,303 --> 00:40:01,370
Hello.

757
00:40:01,437 --> 00:40:03,837
They came after us again.
Who, Vic?

758
00:40:03,904 --> 00:40:05,303
We have our 2-year-old son
with us.

759
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:06,837
We could have
all been killed.

760
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,303
What kind of animal
did you marry?

761
00:40:10,104 --> 00:40:12,804
What happened, Mara?
What did Vic do?

762
00:40:12,871 --> 00:40:14,670
He put a bounty on our heads
with the gangs.

763
00:40:14,737 --> 00:40:17,737
I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

764
00:40:17,804 --> 00:40:19,804
Mackey.

765
00:40:19,871 --> 00:40:21,138
Hey, asshole.

766
00:40:21,204 --> 00:40:22,971
Shane?

767
00:40:23,037 --> 00:40:25,704
As punishment for the shit
you tried to pull today,

768
00:40:25,771 --> 00:40:27,804
there is a letter
on its way to the Barn

769
00:40:27,871 --> 00:40:29,337
addressed to Claudette Wyms,

770
00:40:29,403 --> 00:40:32,704
a written confession of one
of your many sins from the past.

771
00:40:32,771 --> 00:40:34,771
And which sin
would that be, Shane?

772
00:40:34,837 --> 00:40:36,204
I'll let that be
a surprise,

773
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:38,670
but you and Ronnie had better
get used to being cell mates

774
00:40:38,737 --> 00:40:40,204
for the next
three to five years,

775
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:42,437
assuming you can't bullshit
your way out of it.

776
00:40:42,504 --> 00:40:44,403
Either way,
it'll keep you two off my ass

777
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:46,570
for the next few days
trying to intercept it.

778
00:40:46,637 --> 00:40:49,537
This is our ax to grind, Shane.
You leave Ronnie out of it.

779
00:40:49,604 --> 00:40:50,871
Come on, Vic.

780
00:40:50,937 --> 00:40:52,871
We both know you're not shit
without your badge.

781
00:40:52,937 --> 00:40:54,737
There's no way you could have
got that close to me

782
00:40:54,804 --> 00:40:56,204
without your little Vic
back at the Barn.

783
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:58,037
Now for your contrition,

784
00:40:58,104 --> 00:41:01,604
since you caused us
to lose all of our cash today,

785
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:05,071
you're gonna replace it...
$100,000.

786
00:41:05,138 --> 00:41:07,737
And I want it
by 5:00 P.M. Tomorrow.

787
00:41:07,804 --> 00:41:10,138
I'm gonna need
more than a day.

788
00:41:10,204 --> 00:41:11,537
I don't give a shit
what you need.

789
00:41:11,604 --> 00:41:13,937
I can't get it together
that fast. You know that.

790
00:41:14,004 --> 00:41:16,104
This coming from the guy who
masterminded the money train?

791
00:41:16,171 --> 00:41:17,204
Please.

792
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:19,904
You'll figure it out.

793
00:41:19,971 --> 00:41:21,637
Shane's on the phone with Vic
right now,

794
00:41:21,704 --> 00:41:23,104
giving him a task
to carry out.

795
00:41:23,171 --> 00:41:25,637
Please make sure
that he does it.

796
00:41:25,704 --> 00:41:27,138
I just want this
to be over with, Corrine.

797
00:41:27,204 --> 00:41:28,537
Me too.

798
00:41:28,604 --> 00:41:31,937
Now, Corrine is gonna handle
delivering the money to us.

799
00:41:32,004 --> 00:41:35,337
I will call her tomorrow
with a location at 1:00 P.M.

800
00:41:35,403 --> 00:41:38,403
Hey, hey, hey, Corrine's
done enough for you already.

801
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:41,303
You stop trying to shield
yourself behind my ex-wife.

802
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:43,104
You man up,

803
00:41:43,171 --> 00:41:45,403
and you let me come and deliver
that cash to you myself.

804
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:46,971
What,
so you can get another shot

805
00:41:47,037 --> 00:41:48,704
at my pregnant wife
and son?

806
00:41:48,771 --> 00:41:50,037
No, thank you.

807
00:41:50,104 --> 00:41:51,871
I didn't put Mara
in the crosshairs, Shane.

808
00:41:51,937 --> 00:41:54,504
You did when you decided
to involve her in our shit.

809
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:56,971
Corrine delivers
the money tomorrow,

810
00:41:57,037 --> 00:41:59,238
or my next love letter
to Claudette

811
00:41:59,303 --> 00:42:03,037
is about the bullet that you put
under Terry Crowley's left eye.

812
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:06,670
Let's see how much the cops back
at the Barn adore you then.

813
00:42:14,771 --> 00:42:16,971
What?

814
00:42:17,037 --> 00:42:19,904
We got to figure out a way to
put 100 grand in Corrine's hands

815
00:42:19,971 --> 00:42:22,303
by tomorrow afternoon.

816
00:42:28,971 --> 00:42:30,971
I can't go
through this again, Corrine.

817
00:42:31,037 --> 00:42:33,437
Just make sure Vic does
what we want him to do,

818
00:42:33,504 --> 00:42:35,737
or I don't know
what we're gonna do.

819
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:40,270
Mara, this is Claudette Wyms.
Please don't acknowledge me yet.

820
00:42:40,337 --> 00:42:42,670
I want to get you and Shane
out of this mess.

821
00:42:42,737 --> 00:42:45,804
If you and Shane are willing
to talk about Vic Mackey,

822
00:42:45,871 --> 00:42:47,171
I'm willing to listen.

823
00:42:50,937 --> 00:42:54,370
Mara, I can hear
the desperation in your voice.

824
00:42:54,437 --> 00:42:57,604
There is still time
to turn this around.

825
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:59,104
You've got two options.

826
00:42:59,171 --> 00:43:02,937
Come in now,
and I'll grant you immunity.

827
00:43:03,004 --> 00:43:05,138
I can't promise
the same for Shane,

828
00:43:05,204 --> 00:43:07,971
but I can guarantee
that it will be a better deal

829
00:43:08,037 --> 00:43:09,771
than Vic will get.

830
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:13,871
Or you can keep on running
until we catch up with you.

831
00:43:13,937 --> 00:43:16,737
Then it'll be
a whole nother scenario.

832
00:43:16,804 --> 00:43:19,904
You'll be giving birth
in a state penitentiary.

833
00:43:19,971 --> 00:43:25,037
Your baby will be taken
from you... Jackson, too.

834
00:43:25,104 --> 00:43:26,904
They'll be put in the system.

835
00:43:26,971 --> 00:43:30,737
Do you want your children
to be in foster care, Mara?

836
00:43:30,804 --> 00:43:34,904
Be a mother to your children
and do what's right for them.

837
00:43:38,604 --> 00:43:39,937
I can't talk right now.

838
00:43:40,004 --> 00:43:42,670
I want you to know
that all I want from this

839
00:43:42,737 --> 00:43:45,337
is Vic Mackey behind bars.

840
00:43:45,403 --> 00:43:46,771
That's it.

841
00:43:46,837 --> 00:43:49,971
If you are interested
in helping me do that,

842
00:43:50,037 --> 00:43:52,771
<i>then you find a place
where you can talk,</i>

843
00:43:52,837 --> 00:43:57,971
and you call me tomorrow
morning, 8:00, this line.

844
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:01,904
Okay.

845
00:44:09,238 --> 00:44:10,737
I think we got to her.

846
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:18,470
So, how did it go?

847
00:44:28,337 --> 00:44:30,004
Corrine's working
with the police.

848
00:44:41,337 --> 00:44:42,637
It's okay.

849
00:44:42,704 --> 00:44:44,904
It'll be okay.
