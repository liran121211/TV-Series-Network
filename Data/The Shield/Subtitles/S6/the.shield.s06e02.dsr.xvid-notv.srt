1
00:00:01,921 --> 00:00:03,131
Previously on The Shield...

2
00:00:03,132 --> 00:00:05,653
He screwed my ex wife
with the sole purpose

3
00:00:05,654 --> 00:00:09,450
of making this investigation
seem like a personal vendetta.

4
00:00:09,451 --> 00:00:12,395
This guy's just pissing,he's
pissing all over us.

5
00:00:12,396 --> 00:00:17,114
- I've made you coffee and I've been patient,
- you need to go.

6
00:00:18,207 --> 00:00:20,049
Just stop, stop. Stop!

7
00:00:20,155 --> 00:00:22,997
- I'm gonna take a deal.
- I report for processing tomorrow morning.

8
00:00:22,998 --> 00:00:26,537
We gotta wait for you to get to mexico.
We got money parked in an account for you.

9
00:00:26,538 --> 00:00:28,818
- It's all set up.
- I'm not going that route.

10
00:00:28,819 --> 00:00:30,272
They're gonna make you give us up.

11
00:00:30,273 --> 00:00:35,661
Why'd you even come back here tonight
if you weren't planning on leaving?

12
00:00:36,237 --> 00:00:36,870
Shane?

13
00:00:42,533 --> 00:00:47,025
We're gonna find out who did
this. And we're gonna kill him.

14
00:00:47,026 --> 00:00:49,570
It's Guardo, he stepped
on his protection twice.

15
00:00:49,571 --> 00:00:51,713
Killing lem was a message to stay away.

16
00:00:51,714 --> 00:00:55,066
You've murdered two of
your own team members.

17
00:00:55,935 --> 00:01:00,427
- You're done with Mackey. You're off of it.
- I have proof that Vic had lemansky killed.

18
00:01:00,428 --> 00:01:05,385
I say that Vic used me as a middle
man to set up the hit on his guy.

19
00:01:05,386 --> 00:01:07,907
I'm just trying to get
you to tell the truth.

20
00:01:07,908 --> 00:01:09,608
It's just somebody
else's truth, that's all.

21
00:01:09,609 --> 00:01:14,194
You get emolia to lie for you. You just
stepped onto an entirely new playing field.

22
00:01:14,195 --> 00:01:17,051
I hope you know the rules of the game.

23
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:38,714
Sorry. Claudette had us running down a
lead on the san marcos house slaughter.

24
00:01:38,715 --> 00:01:40,611
I thought that was robbery/homicide.

25
00:01:40,612 --> 00:01:43,661
They'd get their loafers dirty knocking
on doors. Who's the bag of bones?

26
00:01:43,662 --> 00:01:47,039
Jupo nunez. Founding father
of the salvadoran gang.

27
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,970
Granted parole yesterday after
50 years of a life sentence.

28
00:01:50,971 --> 00:01:54,853
- Why the early release?
- He's terminal.Lung cancer.

29
00:02:02,976 --> 00:02:03,492
Hey.

30
00:02:04,536 --> 00:02:07,676
You think you can hang on long
enough to answer a few questions?

31
00:02:07,677 --> 00:02:11,563
- Do I know you?
- Vic Mackey.You're before my time.

32
00:02:11,595 --> 00:02:14,431
But your male nurse
probably heard of me.

33
00:02:14,432 --> 00:02:18,349
He's the farmington cop, grandpa.
Had the run-ins with Guardo.

34
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,437
You're the one raging war against us.

35
00:02:20,438 --> 00:02:22,059
Come to tear down a dying man?

36
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:25,673
My beef's with Guardo.
He calls the shots now.

37
00:02:25,802 --> 00:02:28,229
I built this gang from the ground up.

38
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,986
Guardo, all of them,owe me everything.

39
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,844
Leaving you here to live in
paradise. After a lifetime of service.

40
00:02:35,861 --> 00:02:38,419
That's one hell of a pension plan.

41
00:02:38,573 --> 00:02:40,074
You came here to insult me?

42
00:02:40,075 --> 00:02:44,132
I came here to give you a chance
to salvage your life's work.

43
00:02:44,133 --> 00:02:45,282
Now you give me Guardo.

44
00:02:45,283 --> 00:02:48,778
I turn on one of my
own,I disgrace myself.

45
00:02:48,861 --> 00:02:52,708
The salvadoranslost their
honor after Guardo killed a cop.

46
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:55,321
You old school guys. You
knew never to do that.

47
00:02:55,322 --> 00:02:57,749
And in return, we showed
you a level of respect.

48
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,505
Giving him up is a step towards
restoring the glory days.

49
00:03:00,506 --> 00:03:03,887
- I don't know he killed one of you.
- We do. Besides,

50
00:03:03,888 --> 00:03:06,656
maybe your new leader would
have a better sense of history.

51
00:03:06,657 --> 00:03:08,255
How to treat their heroes.

52
00:03:08,256 --> 00:03:11,704
The new generation. No
respectfor the rules.

53
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,428
That's disgraceful.

54
00:03:14,202 --> 00:03:17,436
What's worse is kids
like your grandson here

55
00:03:17,437 --> 00:03:19,888
are gonna have to pay the
price for that disrespect.

56
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:23,442
That gat he's hiding under
his shirt, that's a felony.

57
00:03:23,443 --> 00:03:27,925
Who knows what else I might
find if I decide to bea hardass.

58
00:03:31,205 --> 00:03:33,005
Guardo killed danny rosa.

59
00:03:36,851 --> 00:03:38,627
All I have is a number.

60
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:42,871
It's where we call him
to give him a message.

61
00:03:50,008 --> 00:03:50,980
Vic, it's asher.

62
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:54,101
- what's going on?
- I'm at your house.Serving a search warrant.

63
00:03:54,102 --> 00:03:56,048
- For what?
- I don't know.

64
00:03:56,049 --> 00:03:59,183
- Well, who's there?
- kavanaugh,wagenbach, captain wyms.

65
00:03:59,184 --> 00:04:02,051
Is there anything you need me
to do? Anything to clean up?

66
00:04:02,052 --> 00:04:05,265
No. There's nothing to find.
Thanks for the heads up though.

67
00:04:05,266 --> 00:04:08,391
Jesus christ, kavanaugh's at my
place. He's got a search warrant.

68
00:04:08,392 --> 00:04:10,632
Based on the emolia's bullshit story?

69
00:04:10,633 --> 00:04:13,705
Hey, hey. Is there something
that I need to know?

70
00:04:13,706 --> 00:04:16,547
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

71
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:18,236
Is there anything there to find?

72
00:04:18,237 --> 00:04:20,819
- About lem or anything else?
- No.

73
00:04:32,312 --> 00:04:34,434
Nothing in Vic's closet. You?

74
00:04:34,435 --> 00:04:35,573
Just leftovers.

75
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,030
Did you lookin the trash?

76
00:04:38,031 --> 00:04:42,135
You see the brand new jacket?
Garbage is what god made unis for.

77
00:04:42,136 --> 00:04:44,320
I thought you were gonna
take a personal day.

78
00:04:44,321 --> 00:04:49,129
It's thursday. I figured I take
it tomorrow. Get the 3-day weekend.

79
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,228
Check the bathroom,would you?

80
00:05:05,517 --> 00:05:06,467
Claudette!

81
00:05:07,863 --> 00:05:08,583
Claudette.

82
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:12,130
- Yeah.
- Found this balled up in the trash. The circle there is

83
00:05:12,131 --> 00:05:13,901
where portillo autobody is.

84
00:05:13,902 --> 00:05:15,508
- Where lemansky was killed.
- Yeah.

85
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:17,691
Mackey said he'd never been there.

86
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:22,484
Just keep looking. Cause if he's
this sloppy, maybe there's more.

87
00:05:23,314 --> 00:05:25,226
You've read the statement.

88
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:30,148
You swear it's entirely truthful,
everything about detective Mackey?

89
00:05:30,317 --> 00:05:32,850
- Yes.
- Ok. Sign and date here.

90
00:05:43,518 --> 00:05:46,086
Finished the search of
Vic's house and found these.

91
00:05:46,087 --> 00:05:49,017
This is a matchbook from tama's costora.

92
00:05:49,207 --> 00:05:50,473
Where emolia's been working.

93
00:05:50,474 --> 00:05:54,214
Vic said he hadn't seen or spoken to
her since he cut her off as an informant.

94
00:05:54,215 --> 00:05:56,255
Of course, we don't know when
he picked up the matchbook.

95
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:58,906
$500 cash tucked
inside his yellow pages.

96
00:05:58,907 --> 00:06:03,734
Exact amount that emolia said Vic
offered to give lem up to Guardo.

97
00:06:03,735 --> 00:06:05,787
Vic or any of the other
guys return our calls?

98
00:06:05,788 --> 00:06:06,434
Not yet.

99
00:06:06,914 --> 00:06:09,611
- Was the cash loose in the phone book?
- No. It was in that envelope.

100
00:06:09,612 --> 00:06:12,394
Send it to the crime lab. See if
you can get Vic's prints off of it.

101
00:06:12,395 --> 00:06:14,951
Fine. But if you ask
me,this is all bullshit.

102
00:06:14,952 --> 00:06:18,404
There's no way Vic offed
one of his own guys.

103
00:06:25,804 --> 00:06:28,724
Phone number tracks
here. Nydia hernandez.

104
00:06:28,725 --> 00:06:30,637
I knocked.No one answered.

105
00:06:30,865 --> 00:06:31,920
So what now?

106
00:06:32,788 --> 00:06:37,654
We're gonna go inside. Wait for
Guardo. Take him someplace private.

107
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:40,166
Find out how he got close to lem.

108
00:06:41,376 --> 00:06:45,274
Then we're gonna kill him.
And anybody else involved.

109
00:06:47,218 --> 00:06:51,950
all units stand by for crime broadcast.
Wanted for questioning,detective Vic Mackey.

110
00:06:51,951 --> 00:06:56,162
Farmington detectives.Requesting any
information on his current location.

111
00:06:56,163 --> 00:06:58,514
- All units...
- They must have found something in your house.

112
00:06:58,515 --> 00:07:01,540
- There was nothing to find.
- Why else would they issue an apb?

113
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:04,555
Look, why don't we just go back to
the barn, see what the hell they found,

114
00:07:04,556 --> 00:07:07,611
and clean this mess upright now
before we dig ourselves in any deeper.

115
00:07:07,612 --> 00:07:10,356
Now might be our last shot at Guardo.

116
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:13,231
He's right.

117
00:07:37,264 --> 00:07:38,506
We're all clear.

118
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:43,448
- Looks like she's Guardo's cooch.
- What are we gonna do with her?

119
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:47,509
I don't have too much concern
for Guardo's loved ones.

120
00:08:00,642 --> 00:08:03,093
all right. Someone's here.
Don't get trigger happy.

121
00:08:03,094 --> 00:08:07,166
I want this guy alive long
enough to ask him questions.

122
00:08:18,075 --> 00:08:19,577
Hola.it's nydia.

123
00:08:21,324 --> 00:08:22,357
Esta Guardo?

124
00:08:28,691 --> 00:08:29,816
He's not there.

125
00:08:29,817 --> 00:08:30,908
Gracias.

126
00:08:34,632 --> 00:08:36,234
What's she doing now?

127
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,837
She's making lunch.

128
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:46,091
How's the newfoot patrol going?

129
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:48,982
It's ok, but community
relations is boring.

130
00:08:48,983 --> 00:08:50,469
We're not getting any action.

131
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:52,897
Putting a friendly face on
the department is important.

132
00:08:52,898 --> 00:08:55,290
People need to feel comfortable
bringing their problems to us.

133
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:57,340
Robbery/homicide faxed this over.

134
00:08:57,341 --> 00:09:01,058
It's a composite of the man seen leaving
the side of the san marcos house murders.

135
00:09:01,059 --> 00:09:03,269
Get copies made.Pass it along.

136
00:09:04,695 --> 00:09:07,427
If you're here to get an update on Vic,

137
00:09:07,428 --> 00:09:10,697
I'm too busy. I'll try to find
someone to get you up to speed.

138
00:09:10,698 --> 00:09:13,585
Well, I might have to wait awhile. Your
cupboard down there looks pretty bare.

139
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:15,766
Half my men are out looking
for Vic. The other half

140
00:09:15,767 --> 00:09:18,833
are helping rhd with
this house slaughter.

141
00:09:18,843 --> 00:09:22,690
Would it make your life any easier if
i could get you additional personnel?

142
00:09:22,691 --> 00:09:26,330
Cops, I need. A future
bill in my mailbox, I don't.

143
00:09:26,331 --> 00:09:30,019
You've been captain for a week.
Your homicide rate's quadrupled.

144
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:33,285
- What are you talking about?
- The san marcos triangle's a no man's land between

145
00:09:33,286 --> 00:09:35,644
wilshire, central, and farmington.

146
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:39,511
The body count should've been
divided out in equal percentages.

147
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:42,561
Their captains managed
to dump all 12 on you.

148
00:09:42,562 --> 00:09:45,599
- How'd they do that?
- You're low on the totem pole.

149
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,618
Just happened.

150
00:09:48,603 --> 00:09:50,329
Crime stats will go down.

151
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:53,062
All I need is time to make my input.

152
00:09:53,415 --> 00:09:55,444
Actually, things are
only gonna get tougher.

153
00:09:55,445 --> 00:09:59,426
The mexican police authority
is consolidating three prisons.

154
00:09:59,427 --> 00:10:03,778
So any inmates with 3 years or less left
on their sentences are being released.

155
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:07,273
Based on their gang affiliations, you can
expect a large influx across the border

156
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:08,751
and up in farmington.

157
00:10:08,752 --> 00:10:10,974
Some are probably already here.

158
00:10:11,949 --> 00:10:14,776
Ok. How does this work?

159
00:10:14,964 --> 00:10:17,232
I file the paperwork for a budget bump.

160
00:10:17,233 --> 00:10:20,516
As far as the wilshire and central
captains, I'll try to persuade them to

161
00:10:20,517 --> 00:10:25,917
even out the percentages so that our
district doesn't take the entire hit.

162
00:10:26,097 --> 00:10:28,044
- It's that easy.
- No.

163
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:29,931
But that's how it is.

164
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,728
Now, uh, what can you
tell me about Mackey?

165
00:10:42,479 --> 00:10:45,819
Jesus, how long does
it take to eat a salad?

166
00:10:45,927 --> 00:10:49,081
We should be glad she
didn't take a dump.

167
00:10:50,526 --> 00:10:52,190
All right. She's gone.

168
00:10:57,493 --> 00:10:58,945
International prefix.

169
00:10:59,449 --> 00:11:01,560
Guardo's in mexico.Goddammit.

170
00:11:01,642 --> 00:11:04,274
- We're just gonna have to wait then.
- Not necessarily.

171
00:11:04,275 --> 00:11:07,230
- We can't rush this.
- We gotta handle it right.

172
00:11:07,231 --> 00:11:10,683
There's an apb out for
me. This doesn't wait.

173
00:11:13,641 --> 00:11:17,043
Look, neither one of
you can be seen with me.

174
00:11:18,169 --> 00:11:20,716
That means I gotta do this on my own.

175
00:11:20,717 --> 00:11:23,402
Why don't you go back to the
barn. Be my eyes and ears.

176
00:11:23,403 --> 00:11:25,787
Gather as much intel as you can.

177
00:11:40,557 --> 00:11:43,972
You lied to me, aldo. You told me
you didn't know where Guardo was.

178
00:11:43,973 --> 00:11:47,629
You keep coming around here asking questions.
The salvadorans are going to sniff it out.

179
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:51,999
- You want me killed?
- You lie to me again, I'll do it for them.

180
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,639
- Guardo's in san miguel.
- Why?

181
00:11:55,366 --> 00:11:58,897
- Last favor I have todo for you.
- Fine.

182
00:11:59,893 --> 00:12:02,566
He's bringing a load
of scrips out next week.

183
00:12:02,567 --> 00:12:06,093
Mexi gangs are making a
big play into the game.

184
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:11,992
- How long has he been in mexico?
- As far as I know,just a couple of days.

185
00:12:13,793 --> 00:12:15,581
Where's your cell phone?

186
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:23,670
Now leave the keys and
get out. Now get out.

187
00:12:24,271 --> 00:12:26,705
I'll return it with a full tank.

188
00:12:27,929 --> 00:12:29,300
Where have you two been?

189
00:12:29,301 --> 00:12:31,875
Running down that lead for
robbery/homicide. What's going on?

190
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:34,080
We've been callingyour phones all
morning. Why didn't you pick up?

191
00:12:34,081 --> 00:12:36,755
We turned them off. We were in the
field. We didn't want toblow our cover.

192
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,359
The only reason we're here is
we heard the apb out on Vic.

193
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,527
- You got a search warrant for his house?
- I can't discussthe details.

194
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:45,148
When was the last time you saw Vic?

195
00:12:45,261 --> 00:12:47,151
Called this morning.Said he
was taking a personal day.

196
00:12:47,152 --> 00:12:49,473
Wagenbach and I need
to speak with you two.

197
00:12:49,474 --> 00:12:52,280
Yeah. Yeah, let's get this cleared up.

198
00:12:55,271 --> 00:12:57,475
Your official statement
taken the night lemansky died

199
00:12:57,476 --> 00:13:00,197
says neither you,Vic, or gardocki

200
00:13:00,256 --> 00:13:02,657
had ever been to the portillo auto body.

201
00:13:02,658 --> 00:13:05,437
- Yeah.That sounds right.
- So why did Vic have a map

202
00:13:05,438 --> 00:13:07,607
of the portillo auto body at his house?

203
00:13:07,608 --> 00:13:11,134
Emolia told us that Vic
was gonna give her $500

204
00:13:11,192 --> 00:13:13,466
to deliver lem to the salvadorans.

205
00:13:13,467 --> 00:13:17,613
We found that exact amount in an
envelope with Vic's prints on it.

206
00:13:17,614 --> 00:13:19,514
You think Vic set lem up?

207
00:13:20,025 --> 00:13:23,005
You're crazier than that ex wife of his.

208
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:27,430
Emolia made numerous calls
to a salvadoran contact

209
00:13:27,489 --> 00:13:28,614
prior to lemansky's death.

210
00:13:28,615 --> 00:13:30,549
Emolia was outed as a snitch.

211
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:33,347
She was probably calling
to beg for her life.

212
00:13:33,348 --> 00:13:34,544
That doesn't prove anything.

213
00:13:34,545 --> 00:13:36,268
So how do you explain all
this other evidence here?

214
00:13:36,269 --> 00:13:39,201
I don't know.Maybe, uh,
maybe emolia planted it.

215
00:13:39,202 --> 00:13:40,105
Or you did.

216
00:13:41,219 --> 00:13:42,287
That's gold.

217
00:13:42,648 --> 00:13:45,017
Finish. Go on. I really
want to hear this one.

218
00:13:45,018 --> 00:13:47,691
Well, you investigated Vic for 6 months.

219
00:13:47,692 --> 00:13:51,458
You had every resource the department had
available to you. You came up with nothing.

220
00:13:51,459 --> 00:13:53,746
Now, in the few days after lem dies,

221
00:13:53,747 --> 00:13:57,795
you produce a c.i. willing to testify
against him and the evidence to prove it?

222
00:13:57,796 --> 00:14:01,689
- Come on, man.
- Sounds like you know a lot about telling tall tales.

223
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:04,739
Planting evidence. Practice
makes perfect,right?

224
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,142
Vic didn't kill lem. He's being set up.

225
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:11,373
Look, it's no secret things
ended ugly between Vic and emolia.

226
00:14:11,374 --> 00:14:13,908
Maybe this is just bitch's revenge.

227
00:14:13,909 --> 00:14:18,003
So why'd Vic run? Why isn't
he here defending himself,

228
00:14:18,061 --> 00:14:21,521
- answering our questions instead of you?
- He probably doesn't even know you're looking for him.

229
00:14:21,522 --> 00:14:24,862
Dutchboy, come on, man. Are
you really buying this bullshit?

230
00:14:24,863 --> 00:14:27,314
The evidence is right
here.It's right here.

231
00:14:27,315 --> 00:14:29,660
The real question is
what your involvement is.

232
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:31,960
Vic, it's too late for him.

233
00:14:32,018 --> 00:14:36,512
If you tell uswhere he's hiding,
maybe you can save yourself.

234
00:14:39,071 --> 00:14:41,640
- Como estas.como estas.
- Hermano.

235
00:14:42,003 --> 00:14:45,490
An old amigo of mine
bunkered down in san miguel.

236
00:14:45,491 --> 00:14:49,349
Name's Guardo lima. I need you
to repatriate himto the states.

237
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:52,337
I'm looking for an amigo,
too. Byz lat soldier.

238
00:14:52,338 --> 00:14:54,400
Rumor is he's in east l.a.

239
00:14:57,017 --> 00:14:58,097
Rocha garrenzi.

240
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,298
Wanted for 3murder for
hires in mexico city.

241
00:15:01,299 --> 00:15:03,866
Got his address,aliases, why
couldn't you bust him down there?

242
00:15:03,867 --> 00:15:05,121
He was protected.

243
00:15:05,263 --> 00:15:07,298
Married a big shotcattle
rancher's daughter.

244
00:15:07,299 --> 00:15:12,699
Rocha got tired of milking the same
heifer. Took off with their two ninos.

245
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,864
I know about some mexican
drugs coming into town.

246
00:15:15,865 --> 00:15:17,201
I might have some leverage.

247
00:15:17,202 --> 00:15:20,967
If rocha's arrested in l.a., the case
could get caught up in international courts.

248
00:15:20,968 --> 00:15:24,976
The mother and rich grandparents
are looking fora quicker solution.

249
00:15:24,977 --> 00:15:27,945
They're willing to pay.I'll cut you in.

250
00:15:28,766 --> 00:15:31,920
- What about rocha?
- I don't carewhat you do with him.

251
00:15:31,921 --> 00:15:33,523
I just need the kids.

252
00:15:35,771 --> 00:15:37,609
I'll meet you back here.

253
00:15:37,672 --> 00:15:40,157
- Oh, yeah.
- What did this Guardo do?

254
00:15:40,158 --> 00:15:41,612
Why do you want him?

255
00:15:41,613 --> 00:15:43,103
He killed my friend.

256
00:15:52,113 --> 00:15:53,766
- Yeah.
- Hey, it's me.

257
00:15:53,767 --> 00:15:55,704
I tried to reach Shane,but
he wouldn't answer.

258
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:58,097
Well, he's up in interrogation
with kavanaugh and dutch.

259
00:15:58,098 --> 00:16:00,702
- What? What's going on?
- It's not good.

260
00:16:00,703 --> 00:16:04,625
Asher said they found a map of
portillo's auto body in your garbage.

261
00:16:04,626 --> 00:16:07,769
Also a matchbook from the
shop emolia's been working at.

262
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,200
Someone must haveput them there.

263
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:11,839
They're building a case. You
gotta get back here and fight it.

264
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,111
But they can't prove
anything. I didn't do anything.

265
00:16:14,112 --> 00:16:16,093
It's one thing to have
emolia's statement.

266
00:16:16,094 --> 00:16:17,865
Now they've got corroborating evidence.

267
00:16:17,866 --> 00:16:20,166
Just stay put and keepyour ears open.

268
00:16:20,167 --> 00:16:22,203
Call reyes' gang task force.

269
00:16:22,384 --> 00:16:24,976
You find out which byz lat
is the current king shithead

270
00:16:24,977 --> 00:16:28,181
over in east l.a.
I'll call back in five.

271
00:16:29,814 --> 00:16:32,384
I heard they found evidence on Vic.

272
00:16:32,395 --> 00:16:35,539
Yeah. Maybe a little too much.

273
00:16:36,113 --> 00:16:37,417
What do you mean?

274
00:16:39,737 --> 00:16:42,059
You ever here of occam's razor?

275
00:16:42,482 --> 00:16:44,944
The simplest answer is
usually the right one?

276
00:16:44,945 --> 00:16:47,994
Good. Now apply that
to the lemansky case.

277
00:16:47,995 --> 00:16:50,906
Now all this evidence
is pointing to Vic.

278
00:16:50,907 --> 00:16:53,837
Occam's razor would suggest he's guilty.

279
00:16:55,423 --> 00:16:58,043
Walter chatton's a
contemporary of occam's.

280
00:16:58,044 --> 00:17:01,175
Disputed the razor.
Coined his own anti razor.

281
00:17:01,176 --> 00:17:04,295
- What's that?
- Chatton believed that the world was too complex.

282
00:17:04,296 --> 00:17:09,237
Too many variables to assume that the
simplest answer was always the correct one.

283
00:17:09,238 --> 00:17:10,141
Ok.

284
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:13,926
What do you think is going on?

285
00:17:23,886 --> 00:17:27,908
The salvadorans had a contract out
on your life yet you never left town.

286
00:17:27,909 --> 00:17:29,697
Why not just high-tail it out of here?

287
00:17:29,698 --> 00:17:31,949
I won't talk to anyone but jon.

288
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,706
Kavanaugh's not here, and
you nee to answer my question.

289
00:17:34,707 --> 00:17:38,891
Only reason I'm in this mess
is because of you assholes.

290
00:17:42,684 --> 00:17:43,692
What's this?

291
00:17:44,068 --> 00:17:47,257
I'm exploring another angle.
I'll catch you up later.

292
00:17:47,258 --> 00:17:49,206
Catch me up. Now.

293
00:17:56,446 --> 00:17:58,571
Ok, we know emolia was greenlit.

294
00:17:58,572 --> 00:18:01,785
What if she was trying to gain
favor with Guardo to save her life?

295
00:18:01,786 --> 00:18:06,268
Cut a deal with him. They kill
lemansky, she pins it on Vic.

296
00:18:06,769 --> 00:18:10,621
Mackey's out there right now, and
you're wasting time talking to her.

297
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:15,354
- This interrogation,It's over.
- Uh, no. It's not. I'm not finished yet.

298
00:18:15,355 --> 00:18:18,126
We got every cop we
have out looking for Vic.

299
00:18:18,127 --> 00:18:21,692
Look, private tutoring might
buy you favor with your hot unis,

300
00:18:21,693 --> 00:18:24,654
but it doesn't get us any
closer to scooping up Mackey.

301
00:18:24,655 --> 00:18:27,434
If you want to spend your time
exploring pot shot theories

302
00:18:27,435 --> 00:18:31,044
than doing your job like you were
supposed to, we'd have Vic here right now.

303
00:18:31,045 --> 00:18:34,471
And not some innocent
witness. Come on, emolia.

304
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:44,027
What's up?

305
00:18:47,142 --> 00:18:51,082
I have some concerns about keeping
wagenbach on the lemansky case.

306
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:52,866
- Why?
- I know he's your guy,

307
00:18:52,867 --> 00:18:55,763
but we may have a perception problem
should this case ever go to trial.

308
00:18:55,764 --> 00:18:56,503
How?

309
00:18:58,425 --> 00:19:03,081
The defense lawyer could argue that
dutch's past relationship with corrine

310
00:19:03,082 --> 00:19:05,346
has strained his objectivity.

311
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:09,551
Dutch is protecting Vic
for his ex wife's sake?

312
00:19:09,997 --> 00:19:12,219
Their relationship's no secret.

313
00:19:12,548 --> 00:19:16,701
They could argue that he
has a personal stake in this.

314
00:19:17,058 --> 00:19:20,894
What about the personal
nature of the case with you?

315
00:19:22,651 --> 00:19:23,905
I'm still an outsider.

316
00:19:23,906 --> 00:19:26,216
Iad is always going to have
an adversarial relationship

317
00:19:26,217 --> 00:19:28,799
with the people that we investigate.

318
00:19:29,761 --> 00:19:32,157
But the way this caseis breaking,

319
00:19:32,224 --> 00:19:35,463
with the evidence that
we have to back it up,

320
00:19:35,464 --> 00:19:37,898
this could be a big win for you.

321
00:19:38,162 --> 00:19:40,868
Finally getting Mackey off the street.

322
00:19:48,471 --> 00:19:51,344
They're building a
murder case against him.

323
00:19:51,345 --> 00:19:53,421
And it might actually stick.

324
00:19:53,949 --> 00:19:56,321
We can't let him take this hit.

325
00:20:03,394 --> 00:20:05,048
And what if, uh...

326
00:20:07,453 --> 00:20:11,048
What if I said that i
was with lem or something?

327
00:20:11,049 --> 00:20:13,855
You know, had a grenade from the bust.

328
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,972
Just went off by accident.

329
00:20:19,688 --> 00:20:22,913
Making up some bullshit
story is not gonna help.

330
00:20:22,914 --> 00:20:26,390
Plus you'd be admitting
to aiding and abetting.

331
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,169
Yeah.

332
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:34,618
Yeah, yeah.

333
00:20:35,612 --> 00:20:37,822
We gotta do something for Vic.

334
00:20:38,389 --> 00:20:42,213
The longer he's in the
wind, the guiltier he looks.

335
00:20:53,112 --> 00:20:56,898
- Hey, slow your roll,homes.
- What's your business?

336
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:58,884
I'm here to see santi.

337
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:01,709
Charley,nobody sees jefe without
an appointment or a warrant.

338
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:04,758
I know the local swines, and
i don't recognize your face.

339
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:06,075
I work farmington.

340
00:21:06,108 --> 00:21:09,649
Same place your shipment of mexican
scrips is headed to next week.

341
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:12,098
I don't get to break bread with santi,

342
00:21:12,099 --> 00:21:15,811
the scrips are gonna end
up in my evidence locker.

343
00:21:18,701 --> 00:21:20,923
Hay un placade farmington aqul.

344
00:21:22,302 --> 00:21:24,214
Sabe de los valesque vien.

345
00:21:28,094 --> 00:21:29,634
All right. Let's go.

346
00:21:47,819 --> 00:21:49,781
All right.I need your gun.

347
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,962
It's city issue.

348
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:01,975
- I can't do that.
- Well, then you can'tsee santi.

349
00:22:07,001 --> 00:22:09,273
There. No bullets work for you?

350
00:22:11,807 --> 00:22:14,212
Take a hit. Relax, ese.

351
00:22:14,298 --> 00:22:17,526
No, thanks. I'm good
with the contact high.

352
00:22:19,001 --> 00:22:20,478
So what brings you to the east side?

353
00:22:20,479 --> 00:22:24,423
I need a location on a byz lat
still drying the rio off his back.

354
00:22:24,424 --> 00:22:25,633
Name's rocha.

355
00:22:27,193 --> 00:22:28,565
So let me guess,

356
00:22:28,964 --> 00:22:32,083
i hand him over, and my
scrips make it into town.

357
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:33,822
Great minds think alike.

358
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:38,996
- Rocha's valuable to the bosses.
- More valuable than your scrips?

359
00:22:39,283 --> 00:22:44,434
- You don't want to bust that shipment, friend.
- You're not giving me any other choice.

360
00:22:44,435 --> 00:22:47,614
You bust it, you're declaring war.

361
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:51,978
Not only on the byz lats,
on all the mexi gangs.

362
00:22:57,764 --> 00:22:59,425
I didn't know there was a peace.

363
00:22:59,426 --> 00:23:02,079
I'm gonna give you some
money for your time.

364
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,270
You forget my face. And the scrips.

365
00:23:06,045 --> 00:23:09,352
I don't need your money. I need rocha.

366
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:15,388
I'm offering you an olive branch.

367
00:23:16,792 --> 00:23:19,693
If you prefer shock and
awe, I can arrange that, too.

368
00:23:19,694 --> 00:23:24,397
Back off,pendejo. Lil'
homie's shitfaced, ese.

369
00:23:25,148 --> 00:23:28,388
Junior missed the short
bus to school today.

370
00:23:29,694 --> 00:23:31,904
Tell him to lower that weapon.

371
00:23:37,435 --> 00:23:38,849
**********************

372
00:23:40,517 --> 00:23:44,107
I ain't afraid of no cops. I'll do it.

373
00:23:48,836 --> 00:23:50,725
You got no bullets,cerdo.

374
00:23:51,252 --> 00:23:53,509
All that smoke make you forget?

375
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:56,080
I got one in the chamber, dickhead.

376
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:59,457
Your homeys were too stoned to notice.

377
00:24:00,076 --> 00:24:01,455
One of you shoots me,

378
00:24:01,456 --> 00:24:04,376
my muscle twitch takes
out your bad boy here.

379
00:24:04,377 --> 00:24:08,439
So, either you and I are gonna
leave this basement together,

380
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,370
or we're gonna leave this life together.

381
00:24:12,215 --> 00:24:13,221
You decide.

382
00:24:30,114 --> 00:24:31,237
Stay back.

383
00:24:33,247 --> 00:24:34,292
Back off!

384
00:24:43,376 --> 00:24:46,301
You got to the next red
to tell me where rocha is.

385
00:24:46,302 --> 00:24:48,522
He's putting a hit on a one-niner.

386
00:24:48,523 --> 00:24:49,698
Jumped my lieutenant.

387
00:24:49,699 --> 00:24:51,673
Which one-niner? Which one?

388
00:24:52,214 --> 00:24:54,565
Which one? It's going yellow!

389
00:24:55,754 --> 00:24:57,034
Name's big g.

390
00:24:57,348 --> 00:24:59,149
He deals on eighth and alameda.

391
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:01,754
By colvin high? When's this going down?

392
00:25:01,755 --> 00:25:02,891
Later today.

393
00:25:02,944 --> 00:25:04,668
Rocha doesn't show up,

394
00:25:05,164 --> 00:25:06,562
or you warn him,

395
00:25:06,563 --> 00:25:09,501
and I'm gonna show up with a hell of
a lot more than one in the chamber.

396
00:25:09,502 --> 00:25:10,919
Now get the hell out!

397
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,904
Well, shit, man. At least slow down,ese.

398
00:25:12,905 --> 00:25:15,003
- Get out!
- Slow down, man!

399
00:25:29,705 --> 00:25:30,777
Big g.

400
00:25:32,958 --> 00:25:35,570
Man, check y'all
niggaz later, all right?

401
00:25:35,571 --> 00:25:37,731
- Yeah, so?
- Your lucky day.

402
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,535
Someone's planning on killing
you, and I actually give a shit.

403
00:25:40,536 --> 00:25:42,342
Well, I guess I best
be going then, right?

404
00:25:42,343 --> 00:25:43,596
You aren't going anywhere.

405
00:25:43,597 --> 00:25:45,647
If the killer can't find
you, then they can't kill you.

406
00:25:45,648 --> 00:25:48,442
And that's gonna be a problem for me.

407
00:25:51,474 --> 00:25:53,311
Hey, what if this vato does a drive-by

408
00:25:53,312 --> 00:25:55,021
and gets some shots off
before y'all get to him?

409
00:25:55,022 --> 00:25:56,131
This guy's a pro.

410
00:25:56,132 --> 00:25:59,268
He's gonna step right up to you, put
two in your chest and one in your head.

411
00:25:59,269 --> 00:26:00,784
Oh, and that's supposed to
make me feel better, right?

412
00:26:00,785 --> 00:26:02,449
Get back to your spot!

413
00:26:06,394 --> 00:26:07,934
Hey. Thanks for coming in.

414
00:26:07,935 --> 00:26:11,044
Two unmarked police sedans have been
parked outside my house all day long.

415
00:26:11,045 --> 00:26:13,610
I was a cop's wife long enough
to know that there's trouble.

416
00:26:13,611 --> 00:26:15,687
When was the last time
you saw or spoke to Vic?

417
00:26:15,688 --> 00:26:16,903
Last night.

418
00:26:17,028 --> 00:26:19,509
He said that someone was trying
to pin lem's murder on him.

419
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:22,736
A warrant was filed for
his arrest this morning.

420
00:26:22,737 --> 00:26:24,749
For what? For lem's murder?

421
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,207
He would never in a million years.

422
00:26:26,208 --> 00:26:28,072
The evidence is pointing
in that direction.

423
00:26:28,073 --> 00:26:29,223
What evidence?

424
00:26:29,446 --> 00:26:31,417
Oh, my gosh. You don't
believe this, do you?

425
00:26:31,418 --> 00:26:33,456
I mean, there's no way
that he would ever...

426
00:26:33,457 --> 00:26:35,927
Kavanaugh has generated some proof.

427
00:26:36,026 --> 00:26:40,623
Listen, you need to prepare
yourself for this to go either way.

428
00:26:40,624 --> 00:26:43,678
You need to start
preparing the kids. Ok?

429
00:26:47,543 --> 00:26:50,181
- Corrine, wait.
- What are you doing to my husband, huh?

430
00:26:50,182 --> 00:26:52,101
- Your ex husband.
- I know you hate Vic,

431
00:26:52,102 --> 00:26:54,596
but that doesn't give you the
right to destroy my family.

432
00:26:54,597 --> 00:26:56,557
Vic had lemansky killed
because he was a threat.

433
00:26:56,558 --> 00:26:58,470
- The evidence proves it.
- I don't believe you.

434
00:26:58,471 --> 00:27:00,607
I don't believe any of this!

435
00:27:00,851 --> 00:27:03,075
Let's go somewhere else
so we can talk in private.

436
00:27:03,076 --> 00:27:05,413
Get off of me. Where do
you want to go, to my house?

437
00:27:05,414 --> 00:27:09,032
You want to put your hands all over
me again? Lean me up against the door?

438
00:27:09,033 --> 00:27:11,168
Try to screw me to get back at Vic?

439
00:27:11,169 --> 00:27:13,703
In some demented, twisted way?

440
00:27:14,565 --> 00:27:15,766
I only asked you questions.

441
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:19,463
Yeah, right. You used your
badge to get into my house,

442
00:27:19,464 --> 00:27:21,655
and then you tried to touch me.

443
00:27:21,656 --> 00:27:22,935
I didn't feel safe.

444
00:27:22,936 --> 00:27:25,221
- Um, corrine...
- No, listen to me.

445
00:27:25,222 --> 00:27:29,207
He... He entered my house
under false pretenses.

446
00:27:29,311 --> 00:27:32,024
And then he tried to
sexually assault me.

447
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:33,751
I want to file charges.

448
00:27:34,325 --> 00:27:36,688
- Are you sure about this?
- Either take my statement,

449
00:27:36,689 --> 00:27:39,743
or I'm gonna file
charges somewhere else.

450
00:27:52,927 --> 00:27:54,351
Just stay there.

451
00:28:05,352 --> 00:28:06,436
Drop it!

452
00:28:08,862 --> 00:28:10,818
All right. Where are
you keeping your kids?

453
00:28:10,819 --> 00:28:13,784
- Who in the hell are you? -
Your father-in-law hired me.

454
00:28:13,785 --> 00:28:16,410
All he wants are the kids. If
you tell me where they're at,

455
00:28:16,411 --> 00:28:18,063
then I'll let you go.

456
00:28:18,762 --> 00:28:21,236
The cavalry's gonna show up any minute.

457
00:28:21,237 --> 00:28:22,765
The moreland motel.

458
00:28:23,484 --> 00:28:24,568
Room 8.

459
00:28:24,842 --> 00:28:26,136
All right. Good.

460
00:28:29,049 --> 00:28:30,675
What about letting me go, man?

461
00:28:30,676 --> 00:28:33,184
Yeah. I feel like shit about that.

462
00:28:34,516 --> 00:28:37,458
- How's corrine?
- She's filing charges.

463
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:40,705
Sticking to her guns.
Attempted sexual ag.

464
00:28:40,706 --> 00:28:42,794
- You believe her?
- I believe she believes it.

465
00:28:42,795 --> 00:28:45,617
I wouldn't have thought kavanaugh
was capable of something like that.

466
00:28:45,618 --> 00:28:48,846
Makes you wonder what
else he's capable of.

467
00:28:50,654 --> 00:28:54,167
Yesterday, you insinuated
emolia might have been lying.

468
00:28:54,168 --> 00:28:57,036
Setting Vic up. Today, not a peep. Why?

469
00:29:01,574 --> 00:29:04,355
Maybe considering everything
we suspect Vic's done,

470
00:29:04,356 --> 00:29:06,968
you see him going down
for this as some sort of

471
00:29:06,969 --> 00:29:09,071
karmic justice whether he did it or not.

472
00:29:09,072 --> 00:29:10,836
I know he's a bad guy.

473
00:29:11,302 --> 00:29:13,400
The evidence is the evidence.

474
00:29:13,601 --> 00:29:16,382
It's tempting to let sleeping dogs lie.

475
00:29:16,383 --> 00:29:18,799
Especially when the
dog's as rabid as Vic.

476
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,616
But I've got one chance

477
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:23,078
to right this ship, dutch.

478
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:26,905
To do it, I have to put an end
to a pattern of silent deals

479
00:29:26,906 --> 00:29:30,798
and moral exchanges that have
steered this place off course.

480
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:33,071
That means to pursue the truth.

481
00:29:33,642 --> 00:29:35,070
And the truth only.

482
00:29:43,176 --> 00:29:46,416
Yesterday, I thought
emolia was lying to me.

483
00:29:46,964 --> 00:29:48,179
I still do.

484
00:29:48,462 --> 00:29:50,543
I can't prove it, but
I'm starting to think that

485
00:29:50,544 --> 00:29:52,810
kavanaugh is the one
that fed her the lie.

486
00:29:52,811 --> 00:29:55,632
It's one thing believing Vic's innocent,

487
00:29:55,633 --> 00:29:58,218
but to accuse kavanaugh
of setting Vic up,

488
00:29:58,219 --> 00:30:01,595
- that's a whole other can of worms.
- He's already lied to me once.

489
00:30:01,596 --> 00:30:04,077
He said he met emolia
yesterday at sid's coffee.

490
00:30:04,078 --> 00:30:07,585
I pulled footage from the 101
freeway cam. Sid's is clear.

491
00:30:07,586 --> 00:30:09,402
No kavanaugh. No emolia.

492
00:30:15,032 --> 00:30:19,154
The truth may not always
lead us down the path we want.

493
00:30:20,225 --> 00:30:22,693
But it's the only way to fix this place.

494
00:30:22,694 --> 00:30:25,624
Get emolia and bring her back down here.

495
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,021
Mommy, mommy!

496
00:30:37,942 --> 00:30:38,947
mommy!

497
00:30:42,017 --> 00:30:45,815
- You brought their mother?
- She insisted on coming.

498
00:30:46,616 --> 00:30:47,988
Where's Guardo?

499
00:30:49,034 --> 00:30:51,816
- I'm really sorry. I couldn't get to him.
- That's bullshit!

500
00:30:51,817 --> 00:30:53,620
You didn't tell me how connected he is.

501
00:30:53,621 --> 00:30:56,166
I couldn't get close enough to
talk to him let alone shanghal him.

502
00:30:56,167 --> 00:30:58,111
I don't give a shit how connected he is!

503
00:30:58,112 --> 00:31:00,658
I kept my part of the deal.
I expect you to keep yours.

504
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:02,775
He's got too many people on his payroll.

505
00:31:02,776 --> 00:31:04,029
It's impossible. I'm sorry.

506
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:05,466
Maybe he's got you on his payroll.

507
00:31:05,467 --> 00:31:08,255
Look, I'll make it up to
you, huh? These people are

508
00:31:08,256 --> 00:31:10,280
paying me well for
delivering these kids.

509
00:31:10,281 --> 00:31:12,553
I'll increase your cut. Plus...

510
00:31:12,632 --> 00:31:15,361
- Ask any other favor.
- I don't want your goddamn money.

511
00:31:15,362 --> 00:31:16,538
I want Guardo!

512
00:31:17,015 --> 00:31:20,529
Look, I'm sorry, but
there's nothing I can do.

513
00:31:22,723 --> 00:31:23,755
Goddamnit!

514
00:31:30,605 --> 00:31:31,703
All right.

515
00:31:32,565 --> 00:31:35,294
Can you get close enough to
him to give him a message?

516
00:31:35,295 --> 00:31:40,187
- I might be able to do that.
- Then you meet me here in 2 hours.

517
00:31:40,997 --> 00:31:42,565
It's nonsense.

518
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:46,414
I'll call you back.

519
00:31:47,902 --> 00:31:49,470
Uh, captain.

520
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:52,568
- Why's emolia here?
- I need to ask her some questions.

521
00:31:52,569 --> 00:31:54,410
Great. I'll come with you.

522
00:31:54,411 --> 00:31:57,023
Uh, I prefer some alone time with her.

523
00:31:57,024 --> 00:32:00,015
But you can't question
her without me being there.

524
00:32:00,016 --> 00:32:03,398
The last time I checked, I was
captain of this house not you.

525
00:32:03,399 --> 00:32:06,632
You want to watch, there's a front row
seat for you in the observation room.

526
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:08,347
It's part of her deal.

527
00:32:08,514 --> 00:32:11,159
She's been burned by
the people here before.

528
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:14,326
And I promised i
wouldn't leave her alone.

529
00:32:17,202 --> 00:32:19,593
Fine. But you just listen.

530
00:32:22,036 --> 00:32:26,121
Emolia, I'm the one who said those
things about sebastio. It wasn't Vic.

531
00:32:26,122 --> 00:32:28,433
He always took care of
you two, you know that.

532
00:32:28,434 --> 00:32:31,511
Come on. Emolia, please.
Don't do this to him.

533
00:32:31,512 --> 00:32:32,675
Emolia.

534
00:32:44,585 --> 00:32:47,811
I love this room. It's
my favorite one here.

535
00:32:47,812 --> 00:32:49,228
It's kind of ugly.

536
00:32:49,614 --> 00:32:50,855
Cold.

537
00:32:51,744 --> 00:32:53,694
It's not much to look at.

538
00:32:54,586 --> 00:32:57,392
But it brings the truth out in people.

539
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:01,328
I fixed a lot of wrongs
inside these walls.

540
00:33:01,775 --> 00:33:04,296
That's what we do in here, emolia.

541
00:33:04,297 --> 00:33:07,535
- Find the truth.
- I already told you the truth.

542
00:33:07,536 --> 00:33:10,435
That bullshit story you've been
spinning about Vic? I don't buy it.

543
00:33:10,436 --> 00:33:11,753
That's your problem then.

544
00:33:11,754 --> 00:33:13,817
Guardo wanted to have you killed,

545
00:33:13,818 --> 00:33:17,515
you made up a story about Vic so
that you could get witness protection.

546
00:33:17,516 --> 00:33:19,850
Now does that sound about right?

547
00:33:23,488 --> 00:33:26,878
You can answer her.
It's all right. It's ok.

548
00:33:26,976 --> 00:33:29,066
Vic wanted lem bad.

549
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:32,894
Gave me his location to
give to Guardo. That's it.

550
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:40,110
Officer lowe, officer asher, I need you.

551
00:33:41,645 --> 00:33:43,288
I want you out this room.

552
00:33:43,289 --> 00:33:44,333
That's not gonna happen.

553
00:33:44,334 --> 00:33:47,325
- The assistant chief himself...
- I don't care what deal you made.

554
00:33:47,326 --> 00:33:49,232
Either you leave this room on your own,

555
00:33:49,233 --> 00:33:52,747
or I'll have these two
officers do it for you.

556
00:33:57,889 --> 00:33:59,757
- You all right?
- Yeah.

557
00:34:11,876 --> 00:34:13,540
I've read your jacket.

558
00:34:13,953 --> 00:34:15,892
You've been in a lot of trouble,

559
00:34:15,893 --> 00:34:19,994
but nothing like this pissing
match between Vic and kavanaugh.

560
00:34:19,995 --> 00:34:23,625
I'm getting witness
protection. Starting a new life.

561
00:34:23,626 --> 00:34:26,544
- I'm doing ok.
- You're not doing ok.

562
00:34:26,644 --> 00:34:28,854
You're trapped. You're scared.

563
00:34:29,962 --> 00:34:31,626
You're living in fear.

564
00:34:33,144 --> 00:34:35,481
You're ping-ponging
between these two men who

565
00:34:35,482 --> 00:34:38,159
have done nothing but use and abuse you,

566
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,296
and I'd have more
sympathy for you except

567
00:34:41,583 --> 00:34:43,893
you let them do it for a buck.

568
00:34:43,895 --> 00:34:46,050
Emolia: for my son. Your son?

569
00:34:46,638 --> 00:34:50,151
What are you gonna tell your
son about this time of your life?

570
00:34:50,152 --> 00:34:53,988
That you let Vic and
kavanaugh steal away your soul?

571
00:34:55,054 --> 00:34:59,610
Or that you were lost and found
the strength to free yourself?

572
00:35:00,071 --> 00:35:02,736
I know you're scared. I'd be, too.

573
00:35:05,182 --> 00:35:09,663
But I can offer you a
way out if you let me.

574
00:35:12,576 --> 00:35:15,928
- How?
- First you have to tell me the truth.

575
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:18,904
You've helped this
department out before,

576
00:35:18,905 --> 00:35:21,432
and I can see about
arranging protection.

577
00:35:21,433 --> 00:35:24,385
I'm offering you a way

578
00:35:25,404 --> 00:35:28,395
to be rid of these men forever. Take it.

579
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:30,727
Because they're leading you down a path

580
00:35:30,692 --> 00:35:34,136
that is destroying you, your son...

581
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,462
and everything around you.

582
00:35:38,484 --> 00:35:39,508
You know it.

583
00:35:42,737 --> 00:35:45,350
Everything is gonna be all right.

584
00:35:46,774 --> 00:35:49,034
You're gonna be ok. I promise.

585
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,051
I need to, uh...

586
00:35:53,013 --> 00:35:55,335
I need to talk to captain wyms.

587
00:35:59,389 --> 00:36:03,097
- I have to talk... please.
- It's ok. It's ok.

588
00:36:13,151 --> 00:36:16,131
But first, you got to tell me the truth.

589
00:36:24,489 --> 00:36:26,029
I fed her the story.

590
00:36:28,475 --> 00:36:30,039
Coerced her statement.

591
00:36:30,363 --> 00:36:33,181
Planted the evidence in Mackey's house.

592
00:36:34,278 --> 00:36:36,431
But I framed a guilty man.

593
00:36:53,215 --> 00:36:54,870
- You guys make sure you weren't tailed?
- Yeah.

594
00:36:54,871 --> 00:36:56,828
- Where's Guardo?
- Tonio boned me.

595
00:36:56,829 --> 00:37:00,092
- Couldn't bag the whale.
- Well, what do we do now?

596
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:01,999
Switch bait. Nydia home?

597
00:37:02,188 --> 00:37:02,911
Yeah.

598
00:37:03,564 --> 00:37:05,594
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, man.

599
00:37:07,561 --> 00:37:10,305
What's the plan? Just follow my lead.

600
00:37:20,664 --> 00:37:21,864
Nydia Hernandez?

601
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:23,844
- Yes.
- Detective Mackey.

602
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:26,416
This is detectives
Vendrell and Gardocki.

603
00:37:26,417 --> 00:37:27,616
What's going on?

604
00:37:27,617 --> 00:37:30,171
We have information that someone's
planning on kidnapping you.

605
00:37:30,172 --> 00:37:30,657
What?

606
00:37:30,728 --> 00:37:34,402
Our department's been investigating
a mexican drug lord named salceda.

607
00:37:34,403 --> 00:37:37,507
An informant of ours
told us that he's...

608
00:37:39,568 --> 00:37:42,372
That he's planning to
kill your boyfriend Guardo.

609
00:37:42,373 --> 00:37:45,055
To take over his drug
protection business.

610
00:37:45,056 --> 00:37:47,015
I don't know any Guardo.

611
00:37:48,144 --> 00:37:50,093
- You're not his girlfriend?
- No.

612
00:37:50,094 --> 00:37:51,820
Never heard of the guy.

613
00:37:52,106 --> 00:37:52,794
Wow.

614
00:37:52,953 --> 00:37:56,871
Then, maybe we're looking
for another Nydia Hernandez.

615
00:37:58,194 --> 00:38:01,395
Well, I'm sorry to disturb you
if you're not his girlfriend,

616
00:38:01,396 --> 00:38:03,668
you got nothing to worry about.

617
00:38:06,849 --> 00:38:07,643
Wait.

618
00:38:11,421 --> 00:38:14,165
Guardo told me never to talk to cops.

619
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:16,703
Why would someone want to kidnap me?

620
00:38:16,704 --> 00:38:18,616
It's Guardo Salceda wants.

621
00:38:19,052 --> 00:38:20,530
But he's in Mexico.

622
00:38:20,763 --> 00:38:23,498
Kidnapping you,

623
00:38:23,587 --> 00:38:27,044
to use you as bait to
lure Guardo back to L.A.

624
00:38:27,045 --> 00:38:29,391
We were worried we weren't
going to get to you in time.

625
00:38:29,392 --> 00:38:34,060
We need to get you into a safehouse
while we hunt down Salceda.

626
00:38:34,174 --> 00:38:36,079
Well, I should call Guardo. Warn him.

627
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,320
No, we don't know who's
listening on his side of the line.

628
00:38:38,321 --> 00:38:40,879
Our intel says it's an inside job.

629
00:38:41,144 --> 00:38:42,982
We have to move you now.

630
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:46,666
- How long is thisgonna take?
- A day. Two at the most.

631
00:38:46,667 --> 00:38:48,555
Ronnie will take you to
the safehouse immediately.

632
00:38:48,556 --> 00:38:50,864
We'll pack some clothes for
you. Meet you there, all right?

633
00:38:50,865 --> 00:38:52,549
Come on. We better get going.

634
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:53,239
Ok.

635
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,716
What the hell are you doing?
What the hell are you doing?

636
00:38:59,717 --> 00:39:00,458
Vic?

637
00:39:03,634 --> 00:39:06,061
Just pack. I'll explain later.

638
00:39:25,325 --> 00:39:27,845
I never cheated on anything before.

639
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:30,768
The first time I do, I get caught...

640
00:39:30,769 --> 00:39:34,297
taking the dirtiest man
i ever met off the street.

641
00:39:34,298 --> 00:39:36,679
You set another cop up for murder.

642
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:40,268
Threw away your career.
I fail to see the humor.

643
00:39:40,827 --> 00:39:43,571
I guess I didn't have enough practice

644
00:39:43,668 --> 00:39:45,961
planting evidence,
manipulating witnesses,

645
00:39:45,962 --> 00:39:50,716
and covering my tracks. You sacrificed
your integrity for Vic Mackey.

646
00:39:50,717 --> 00:39:54,051
You are betterthan that. You
used to be better than him.

647
00:39:54,052 --> 00:39:55,022
I still am.

648
00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:00,076
Take his gun and badge.

649
00:40:10,009 --> 00:40:14,932
You're under arrestfor interfering in
police business under color of authority.

650
00:40:14,933 --> 00:40:17,686
I assume other charges will follow.

651
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:20,496
- Put him in the cage?
- No.

652
00:40:20,497 --> 00:40:25,351
Take him straight to police one.
Cuff him in front. Keep it quiet.

653
00:40:32,548 --> 00:40:35,404
At least I have Mackey out of my life.

654
00:40:35,813 --> 00:40:37,899
He's not my problem anymore.

655
00:40:38,354 --> 00:40:39,368
He's yours.

656
00:41:16,294 --> 00:41:17,441
What's this?

657
00:41:18,006 --> 00:41:21,040
It's the message I want
you to deliver to Guardo.

658
00:41:21,041 --> 00:41:22,214
A necklace?

659
00:41:22,991 --> 00:41:24,772
Deliver it to him in person.

660
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:27,349
You tell him that
Nydia's been kidnapped.

661
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:29,731
If he ever wants tos ee her again,

662
00:41:29,732 --> 00:41:32,876
he has 24 hours to get
fifty grand in cash,

663
00:41:32,877 --> 00:41:34,554
in person to L.A.

664
00:41:38,083 --> 00:41:39,908
I don't think I want any part of this.

665
00:41:39,909 --> 00:41:41,893
Let alone what you do to
him after you've got him.

666
00:41:41,894 --> 00:41:45,170
- Vic, come on. Think about this.
- You're delivering a message.

667
00:41:45,171 --> 00:41:46,988
Your involvement ends there.

668
00:41:46,989 --> 00:41:50,441
And I'll for go my cut
for the returned kids.

669
00:41:54,348 --> 00:41:55,036
Ok.

670
00:41:56,889 --> 00:42:02,153
You tell Guardo, call Nydia's cell
phone when he wants to set the meet.

671
00:42:03,634 --> 00:42:05,062
Hey, hey. A ransom?

672
00:42:05,204 --> 00:42:07,215
The last thing we need
is more dirty money.

673
00:42:07,216 --> 00:42:09,439
I don't give a shit about the 50 grand.

674
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:13,480
Once Guardo finds out Nydia's been
kidnapped, he'll have to come to L.A.

675
00:42:13,481 --> 00:42:16,021
Word gets out he can't
protect his own girlfriend,

676
00:42:16,022 --> 00:42:19,374
who's gonna trust him
to protect their drugs?

677
00:42:20,274 --> 00:42:21,752
Vic, don't do this.

678
00:42:22,021 --> 00:42:22,974
Please.

679
00:42:23,468 --> 00:42:24,510
Lem's gone.

680
00:42:25,127 --> 00:42:27,871
Nothing we can do can bring him back.

681
00:42:29,698 --> 00:42:33,994
If you push this too far,
man, we're gonna lose you, too.

682
00:42:36,774 --> 00:42:38,239
Guardo has to pay.

683
00:42:54,157 --> 00:42:56,388
- Where's Nydia?
- The bedroom sleeping.

684
00:42:56,389 --> 00:42:58,294
This just turned into a kidnapping.

685
00:42:58,295 --> 00:43:00,879
- What do you mean?
- Vic sent a messageto Guardo.

686
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,249
If he doesn't meet us
in 24 hours, she dies.

687
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:07,028
- What do we do if he doesn't show?
- Oh, he'll show.

688
00:43:07,029 --> 00:43:08,934
- This her cell phone?
- Yeah.

689
00:43:08,935 --> 00:43:12,128
If he does show, what do we do with
her? I don't know what I'm gonna do yet.

690
00:43:12,129 --> 00:43:13,752
Vic, this is wrong.

691
00:43:14,387 --> 00:43:17,126
You two don't have to be involved
in this. Go back to the barn.

692
00:43:17,127 --> 00:43:19,101
Keep your distance from me.

693
00:43:26,749 --> 00:43:27,825
Good job.

694
00:43:28,955 --> 00:43:30,172
How's he doing?

695
00:43:30,587 --> 00:43:33,409
- He's beautiful. I'll see you.
- How are you?

696
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:34,769
I'm exhausted.

697
00:43:35,285 --> 00:43:37,773
He's been colicky.
Keeping me up all night.

698
00:43:37,774 --> 00:43:40,684
Well, I do havesome good news i
wanted to tell youface to face.

699
00:43:40,685 --> 00:43:44,805
Any excuse to get out of the
house. I need some adult time.

700
00:43:44,806 --> 00:43:47,078
You passed the sergeant's exam.

701
00:43:47,258 --> 00:43:49,764
- Congratulations.
- Oh, God.

702
00:43:49,888 --> 00:43:51,052
Bless you.

703
00:43:52,076 --> 00:43:55,233
So I start wearing these as soon
as my maternity leave is over, huh?

704
00:43:55,234 --> 00:43:58,923
The slot's available
effective immediately.

705
00:43:59,134 --> 00:44:03,563
If you don't take it, your name
goes back to the bottom of the list.

706
00:44:03,564 --> 00:44:05,963
You mean I have to come
back to work right away?

707
00:44:05,964 --> 00:44:08,681
Or you pick another slot if it opens up.

708
00:44:08,682 --> 00:44:13,024
That's what happens when men make the rules.
You sleep on it, let me know in the morning.

709
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:16,199
Hey, either of you two
seen or heard from Vic?

710
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,870
If you do, tell him he can go home.

711
00:44:20,893 --> 00:44:22,051
Why is that?

712
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:25,050
Because the case against
him has been dropped.

713
00:44:25,051 --> 00:44:27,609
So, if he is still in the country,

714
00:44:27,633 --> 00:44:31,035
tell him he can sleep
in his own bed tonight.

715
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,679
You're clear.

716
00:44:33,805 --> 00:44:35,643
You can go back to work.

717
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:37,529
Just let Nydia go.

718
00:44:40,182 --> 00:44:41,548
We got a reprieve.

719
00:44:41,715 --> 00:44:45,234
- Dutchboy and Claudette saved our asses.
- Let's just wake her up and get her out of here, man.

720
00:44:45,235 --> 00:44:47,565
She's how we're going to get to Guardo.

721
00:44:47,566 --> 00:44:50,224
What happened to no more
unilateral decisions.

722
00:44:50,225 --> 00:44:51,633
Shane's right.

723
00:44:52,071 --> 00:44:53,713
I want this guy just as bad as you,

724
00:44:53,714 --> 00:44:57,358
- but not like this. This is too risky.
- Every second,

725
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:58,787
he gets to breathe,

726
00:44:58,902 --> 00:45:01,452
and Lem doesn't is unacceptable.

727
00:45:08,088 --> 00:45:09,504
I'll do it myself.

728
00:45:09,841 --> 00:45:11,393
What is your problem?

729
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:14,458
Can you listen to anybody but yourself?

730
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:19,232
Lem wouldn't listen about going to Mexico. He's
dead because of it. Is that what you want, man, huh?

731
00:45:19,233 --> 00:45:23,868
You want to die? You want to go
to jail? You want us to go to jail?

732
00:45:23,869 --> 00:45:24,636
Huh?

733
00:45:37,006 --> 00:45:39,227
Go home. Get some shut eye.

734
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,678
I'll guard the fort for the night.

735
00:45:53,544 --> 00:45:55,499
I'll just be a minute.

736
00:46:01,104 --> 00:46:03,059
You've been a very busy boy.

737
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:05,954
Planting evidence. Coercing witnesses.

738
00:46:06,699 --> 00:46:08,405
Assaulting my ex wife.

739
00:46:08,937 --> 00:46:10,849
I learned from the master.

740
00:46:13,825 --> 00:46:17,699
I told you you weren't
ready to play at this level.

741
00:46:17,783 --> 00:46:20,527
Wouldn't have mattered even if I was.

742
00:46:20,537 --> 00:46:21,757
The truth is,

743
00:46:22,367 --> 00:46:23,907
isn't your time yet.

744
00:46:24,808 --> 00:46:26,200
But it'll happen.

745
00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:29,469
The universe will take out
its trash when it's ready.

746
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:31,676
Looks like it already has.

747
00:46:33,715 --> 00:46:36,247
You corrupted everything around you.

748
00:46:36,453 --> 00:46:40,081
Turned a good man like Lemansky
into a thug and a thief.

749
00:46:40,082 --> 00:46:42,342
And you got him killed for it.

750
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:46,226
I tried to become you
for a minute. But...

751
00:46:46,736 --> 00:46:48,214
it wasn't worth it.

752
00:46:49,177 --> 00:46:52,145
I'll take my lumps. Go back to my life.

753
00:46:52,961 --> 00:46:58,027
But I won't be the one hearing my
dead friend's screams in my head.

754
00:46:59,282 --> 00:47:02,786
You preach all the
existential bullshit you want.

755
00:47:02,787 --> 00:47:07,431
But I'm the one going home to
my bed while you're still here.

756
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,527
I'm at peace.

757
00:47:11,482 --> 00:47:12,515
Are you?

758
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:16,800
Soon enough.
