1
00:00:01,151 --> 00:00:03,075
Previously on the shield...

2
00:00:04,287 --> 00:00:04,866
I can't run.

3
00:00:04,867 --> 00:00:06,811
Right now it's about keeping you alive.

4
00:00:06,812 --> 00:00:08,730
You've got history with these grenade tossers.

5
00:00:08,731 --> 00:00:11,785
The guy with the grenades is named guardo.

6
00:00:12,841 --> 00:00:13,748
but he got away.

7
00:00:13,749 --> 00:00:15,190
He screwed my ex-wife.

8
00:00:15,191 --> 00:00:20,190
Sole purpose. Making this investigation
seem like a personal vendetta.

9
00:00:20,191 --> 00:00:22,763
He may have assassinated a gang leader.

10
00:00:22,764 --> 00:00:24,176
This was not part of the deal.

11
00:00:24,177 --> 00:00:26,351
Sure it was. The part antwon didn't tell you about.

12
00:00:26,352 --> 00:00:29,168
This was a calculated move by lieutenant kavanaugh

13
00:00:29,169 --> 00:00:31,030
to put curtis' life in jeopardy

14
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,392
to compel him to testify against his team.

15
00:00:33,393 --> 00:00:35,858
My client is willing to plead to new charges

16
00:00:35,859 --> 00:00:38,424
as long as we can reasonably guarantee his safety.

17
00:00:38,425 --> 00:00:39,926
What does he have to say about his friends?

18
00:00:39,927 --> 00:00:42,273
- Nothing.
- There is one other option, though.

19
00:00:42,274 --> 00:00:44,265
I can't turn on my family.

20
00:00:44,266 --> 00:00:47,738
We're gonna lose a vast
chance at nailing, Vic.

21
00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:50,570
You got to make him believe
that Lemansky gave it up

22
00:00:50,571 --> 00:00:51,728
for witness protection.

23
00:00:51,729 --> 00:00:52,854
Lemansky's talking.

24
00:00:52,855 --> 00:00:55,157
Now all this bullshit can blow back on me.

25
00:00:55,158 --> 00:00:56,503
If he had a change of heart, he would've tipped us.

26
00:00:56,504 --> 00:00:59,237
Well, he wouldn't if his deal meant us going down.

27
00:00:59,238 --> 00:01:01,145
We go to the spot and we'll take his temperature.

28
00:01:01,146 --> 00:01:03,179
If he doesn't show, assume he made the deal.

29
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,098
We got to wait until you get to mexico.

30
00:01:06,701 --> 00:01:07,779
It's all set up.

31
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:08,994
I'm not going that route.

32
00:01:08,995 --> 00:01:11,623
Then why did you even come back here
if you weren't planning on leaving?

33
00:01:11,624 --> 00:01:13,297
I came to see you guys.

34
00:01:13,298 --> 00:01:15,086
I brought you some food.

35
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:18,210
Shane.

36
00:01:23,215 --> 00:01:25,499
Are you happy, detective mackey?

37
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:30,124
Break 'em up.

38
00:01:31,105 --> 00:01:33,539
I'm gonna find out who did this.

39
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:35,147
I wanna kill 'em.

40
00:01:37,517 --> 00:01:39,231
and then it came to me

41
00:01:39,895 --> 00:01:41,742
just what i had done

42
00:01:42,195 --> 00:01:44,323
and all for no reason

43
00:01:44,636 --> 00:01:46,576
just one piece of lead

44
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,971
i hung my head

45
00:01:49,425 --> 00:01:51,287
i hung my head

46
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,697
here in the courthouse
the whole town was there

47
00:02:06,249 --> 00:02:10,301
i see the judge
high up in his chair

48
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:14,875
explain to the courtroom
what went through your mind

49
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,521
and we'll ask the jury
what verdict they find

50
00:02:20,315 --> 00:02:24,274
i felt the power
of death over life

51
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:29,171
i orphaned his children
i widowed his wife

52
00:02:29,426 --> 00:02:33,806
i begged their forgiveness
i wish i was dead

53
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,127
i hung my head

54
00:02:36,455 --> 00:02:38,426
i hung my head

55
00:02:38,739 --> 00:02:40,977
i hung my head

56
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,323
i hung my head

57
00:02:49,173 --> 00:02:51,979
i ran down the grocery guy's contacts.

58
00:02:52,177 --> 00:02:55,348
No one's seen guardo.
He's a goddamn ghost.

59
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:56,850
Anything south of the border?

60
00:02:56,851 --> 00:02:59,619
Our federale is neck-deep
in some prison beef.

61
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,688
Couldn't help.

62
00:03:05,055 --> 00:03:08,340
How did guardo get lem
to show up at that place?

63
00:03:08,341 --> 00:03:09,107
Alone.

64
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,920
And the way he died.

65
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:17,769
Shit.

66
00:03:24,344 --> 00:03:25,612
We find guardo...

67
00:03:27,129 --> 00:03:28,731
He dies the same way.

68
00:03:30,873 --> 00:03:31,905
Only slower.

69
00:03:34,057 --> 00:03:35,183
Yeah. He will.

70
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:40,428
If only he'd reach out to us instead of becca.

71
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:43,607
- He should've trusted us.
- He was scared.

72
00:03:43,816 --> 00:03:50,272
- If i didn't let the whole thing with antwon go shit-side up...
- It's nobody's fault.

73
00:03:59,972 --> 00:04:01,574
You were a great cop.

74
00:04:02,215 --> 00:04:03,639
You were a great friend.

75
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,962
Here's the 21 you deserve, man.

76
00:04:40,343 --> 00:04:41,550
partner go home?

77
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,669
Billings takes 9 to 5 very seriously.

78
00:04:44,801 --> 00:04:46,314
Another homicide volunteer?

79
00:04:46,315 --> 00:04:48,888
to lemansky's murder.

80
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:50,720
First two didn't get one detail right.

81
00:04:50,721 --> 00:04:53,474
This guy wasn't even in the country
when it happened.

82
00:04:53,475 --> 00:04:58,098
Guy turns himself in,
keeps the heat off the gang.

83
00:04:58,189 --> 00:04:59,236
He? What he?

84
00:04:59,425 --> 00:05:01,246
out of downtown.

85
00:05:01,383 --> 00:05:05,071
No police funeral. No press conference.
It's like lemansky never wore a badge.

86
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:07,096
He's ready to be processed.

87
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,944
Vic check in yet?

88
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:14,630
No. I'll get this.

89
00:05:18,075 --> 00:05:21,763
Hey, is vic around? I can't get him on the phone.

90
00:05:21,901 --> 00:05:26,431
No. He's still taking some personal time.
He's not supposed to be back until tomorrow.

91
00:05:26,432 --> 00:05:29,300
Is everything ok?
I haven't heard from him in days.

92
00:05:29,301 --> 00:05:32,533
I leave messages. He doesn't get back to me.

93
00:05:32,534 --> 00:05:33,605
The kids are freaking out.

94
00:05:33,606 --> 00:05:36,884
Well, i'm sure he's just sorting things out.

95
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:37,887
Yeah.

96
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,960
I'll get a message to him.

97
00:05:39,961 --> 00:05:41,373
Have him call me.

98
00:05:48,329 --> 00:05:50,629
A.c., sorry to startle you.

99
00:05:50,811 --> 00:05:53,245
Can i get a minute of your time?

100
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,182
What now, lieutenant?

101
00:05:55,570 --> 00:06:00,001
I just wanna apologize for my behavior last week
in captain wyms' office.

102
00:06:00,002 --> 00:06:03,985
- It was out of line. I let it get too personal.
- Yeah, you did.

103
00:06:03,986 --> 00:06:08,579
I've been doing a lot of soul searching
in the light of lemansky's death,

104
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:12,192
- trying to locate my motives.
- Motives for what?

105
00:06:13,464 --> 00:06:14,761
For finding his killer.

106
00:06:14,762 --> 00:06:16,302
That's not your job.

107
00:06:16,424 --> 00:06:18,996
Wyms' office is in charge of that investigation.

108
00:06:18,997 --> 00:06:19,680
I know.

109
00:06:20,032 --> 00:06:22,354
And wagenbach, he's a good man.

110
00:06:22,574 --> 00:06:25,419
But he's only looking at this from the salvadoran angle.

111
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,546
What do you want, jon?

112
00:06:26,547 --> 00:06:28,277
Same thing i wanted last week.

113
00:06:28,278 --> 00:06:31,251
Not gonna happen. You can't see the line anymore.

114
00:06:31,252 --> 00:06:34,279
Nobody can see the line. Mackey just keeps moving it.

115
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,695
Please. I just need...you need a time for a dead cop.

116
00:06:37,696 --> 00:06:39,267
He deserves that.

117
00:06:42,781 --> 00:06:44,648
Ok. What is it?

118
00:06:45,786 --> 00:06:49,316
The brick of tar that we found on lemansky

119
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:53,560
was a part of something dirty that vic put into motion.

120
00:06:53,672 --> 00:06:57,907
When curtis got caught,
vic need to protect himself.

121
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:00,425
So he let lemansky take the plea

122
00:07:00,477 --> 00:07:03,277
while he brokered a deal with antwon mitchell

123
00:07:03,278 --> 00:07:05,395
for his guy's safety in the joint.

124
00:07:05,396 --> 00:07:07,668
But the mitchell deal went bad.

125
00:07:08,357 --> 00:07:10,702
Curtis, he panicked, on the run.

126
00:07:11,522 --> 00:07:13,867
Vic knew that this guy was gonna crack,

127
00:07:13,868 --> 00:07:16,576
- that curtis was gonna
- mackey killed his own guy?

128
00:07:16,577 --> 00:07:19,957
More than likely, he cut a deal with the salvadorans.

129
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:23,361
But somebody put that grenade in lemansky's lap.

130
00:07:23,362 --> 00:07:25,560
And vic, he knows who did it.

131
00:07:25,707 --> 00:07:28,621
Let wagenbach follow the salvadoran trail.

132
00:07:28,622 --> 00:07:32,060
Let me look into vic.
Discreet. Respectful.

133
00:07:35,064 --> 00:07:37,932
I want your report end of day tomorrow.

134
00:07:38,115 --> 00:07:40,531
We'll decide if it makes sense to pursue.

135
00:07:40,532 --> 00:07:41,739
You'll have it.

136
00:07:42,604 --> 00:07:43,856
Thank you, sir.

137
00:07:59,314 --> 00:08:01,111
There's nothing new on lem.

138
00:08:01,112 --> 00:08:03,594
We've been spending more time knocking down false confessions.

139
00:07:58,905 --> 00:08:00,939
There's nothing new on lem.

140
00:08:01,034 --> 00:08:03,381
We've been spending more time knocking down false confessions.

141
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:05,511
It's all a smokescreen. It's guardo.

142
00:08:05,512 --> 00:08:08,405
We stepped on his drug protection play twice.

143
00:08:08,406 --> 00:08:10,698
Killing lem was a message to stay away.

144
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:15,012
Been waiting on you. Water street methadone
clinic got torched.

145
00:08:15,013 --> 00:08:18,125
- Go check that out.
- We're not arson patrol.

146
00:08:18,126 --> 00:08:20,854
Well, it's a drug rehab in a heavy gang area.

147
00:08:20,855 --> 00:08:24,059
I can't sign off on you working lem's murder.

148
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,519
Take a step back. Focus on something else.

149
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,920
If we find something out, we'll let you know.

150
00:08:29,028 --> 00:08:34,076
Hey, um, corrine was here last night.
She hadn't heard from you. The kids were worried.

151
00:08:34,077 --> 00:08:35,989
Maybe you should call her.

152
00:08:37,871 --> 00:08:38,978
Right.

153
00:08:44,987 --> 00:08:46,576
Shit. Split. Split.

154
00:08:48,057 --> 00:08:48,637
Hey!

155
00:08:49,603 --> 00:08:51,701
- Hey!
- Turn that shit off.

156
00:08:51,757 --> 00:08:53,462
Come here. Come here.

157
00:08:54,393 --> 00:08:56,509
How's antwon's favorite errand bitch?

158
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:59,316
- You got a need?
- Yeah. To do this.

159
00:09:03,849 --> 00:09:08,591
- Damn, i got leftovers older than you.
- Yeah, but not as tasty.

160
00:09:09,703 --> 00:09:14,455
Hey, looks like moses finally made it
to the land of milk and underage honey.

161
00:09:14,456 --> 00:09:18,023
- She legal and all kind of willin'.
- Vic.

162
00:09:19,228 --> 00:09:22,425
Goddamn. Looks like business has been good.

163
00:09:22,935 --> 00:09:25,721
No thanks to you. Goddamn empty safe.

164
00:09:27,665 --> 00:09:31,985
Look like your daddy might have to
break on sugar, darlin'.

165
00:09:33,596 --> 00:09:37,480
You wanna get off the dead-banger's list,
you learn to play by the rules.

166
00:09:37,481 --> 00:09:40,585
The first one is, we still make the rules.

167
00:09:41,856 --> 00:09:45,309
Burnt-out clinic on water. That's a 1-9er block.

168
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,295
Looks like you guys might be holding the match.

169
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:49,148
- We got no beef with the methadonians.
- No?

170
00:09:49,149 --> 00:09:52,903
- They good business.
- How's them climbing off the horse help you?

171
00:09:52,904 --> 00:09:57,499
What we lose in h we gain in benzos.
Some of them junkies drop 10 tabs a day.

172
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,969
- Clinic knows that's going on?
- They don't give a shit.

173
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:04,888
Getting clean's big money.
Turns those street junkies into state-sponsored ones.

174
00:10:04,889 --> 00:10:09,582
Hell, yeah.
Some of them zombies been on the m-dose 20 goddamn years.

175
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,603
Shit.

176
00:10:11,604 --> 00:10:15,151
Get a hold of the torched clinic.
See if anybody violent's trying to kick their dose.

177
00:10:15,152 --> 00:10:18,099
- Someone on the jones?
- Hurting. Delusional.

178
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,702
I'd be setting fires.

179
00:10:20,391 --> 00:10:24,073
Call wyms. Have her post units at all the methadone facilities.

180
00:10:24,074 --> 00:10:30,020
You, tell your fearless leader, you ever need a favour, shouldn't hesitate to call.

181
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:32,221
I owe him one.

182
00:10:36,446 --> 00:10:39,082
Clinic said
********methadone kick.

183
00:10:39,109 --> 00:10:41,051
This idiot's lowering his own dosage?

184
00:10:41,052 --> 00:10:44,847
Down to 30 mils.
****by big medicine.

185
00:10:44,857 --> 00:10:47,144
Threatened a counselor. Lives here with his best friend.

186
00:10:47,145 --> 00:10:50,175
No one's seen either of them for 2 days.

187
00:10:59,561 --> 00:11:00,753
Kitchen's clear.

188
00:11:03,021 --> 00:11:03,802
Bedroom's clear.

189
00:11:03,803 --> 00:11:06,074
Looks like quentin's seen some time in the desert.

190
00:11:05,975 --> 00:11:07,931
Probably where he picked up his habit.

191
00:11:07,932 --> 00:11:11,112
- You smell that?
- Yeah.

192
00:11:12,967 --> 00:11:14,478
Ah.

193
00:11:15,427 --> 00:11:17,592
Smells like burnt toast.

194
00:11:21,608 --> 00:11:23,593
Kevin Smith. The roommate.

195
00:11:23,628 --> 00:11:27,644
Cracked his skull open, went through
his wallet, left him for dead.

196
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:33,829
I'm glad this guy's his best friend.
I'd hate to see what he'd do to his enemies.

197
00:11:43,367 --> 00:11:44,140
Thank you.

198
00:11:44,175 --> 00:11:48,637
- Got anything new on the lemansky murder?
- N... No.

199
00:11:54,086 --> 00:11:56,457
Uh, i called you actually.

200
00:11:56,496 --> 00:11:59,411
Is there any way to get in touch with your el salvadoran c.i.?

201
00:11:59,412 --> 00:12:01,766
Emolia? What do you wanna talk to her for?

202
00:12:01,767 --> 00:12:04,108
Guardo's my lead suspect. She's seen him,
knows that world.

203
00:12:04,109 --> 00:12:06,977
Figured out maybe she's got a pipeline.

204
00:12:07,163 --> 00:12:11,520
She talked about going to seattle, be with her sister.

205
00:12:11,566 --> 00:12:13,937
I really don't know where she is right now.

206
00:12:13,938 --> 00:12:16,204
Um, you parking here?

207
00:12:16,232 --> 00:12:19,587
- I thought your investigation was over.
- It is. I'm opening a new one

208
00:12:19,588 --> 00:12:22,232
in conjunction with lemansky's death.

209
00:12:22,244 --> 00:12:25,565
I'm creating a timeline for my lead suspect.

210
00:12:26,233 --> 00:12:28,007
Who is that?

211
00:12:28,008 --> 00:12:29,836
This is footage from the city and freeway cams

212
00:12:29,837 --> 00:12:32,190
on the night that lemansky was murdered.

213
00:12:32,191 --> 00:12:34,843
In his voluntary statement given the next morning,

214
00:12:34,844 --> 00:12:35,969
mackey said,

215
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:41,204
"it was too late to see my kids,
"so i hopped on the 10,

216
00:12:41,225 --> 00:12:45,195
"headed towards the coast highway.
That drive always clears my head."

217
00:12:45,196 --> 00:12:50,050
you're establishing a timeline for vic
on the night of the murder?

218
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,532
Yeah.

219
00:12:53,411 --> 00:12:54,905
Uh...um...

220
00:12:56,156 --> 00:12:59,986
Lemansky and mackey were extraordinarily tight.

221
00:13:00,021 --> 00:13:01,983
Plus you've got no motive.

222
00:13:03,713 --> 00:13:05,377
Here's the thing, man.

223
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:12,515
I had aceveda tell mackey
that lem was cutting a deal,

224
00:13:12,536 --> 00:13:17,702
that he was giving up vic and his team for immunity.

225
00:13:18,345 --> 00:13:23,361
I knew that mackey would go to curtis
to try to find out the truth.

226
00:13:23,661 --> 00:13:27,236
So we were gonna tail him, get him on aiding and abetting.

227
00:13:27,237 --> 00:13:29,996
But vic and his guys, they shook up.

228
00:13:30,048 --> 00:13:34,716
A couple of hours later,
I see him standing by lemansky's body.

229
00:13:34,725 --> 00:13:36,430
Jesus christ.

230
00:13:36,465 --> 00:13:41,788
Maybe it wasn't mackey. Maybe he couldn't do it.
But he needed it done.

231
00:13:41,809 --> 00:13:45,165
He had lem killed because i gave him up.

232
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,836
All right, let's get an a.p.b. out on quentin.

233
00:13:48,837 --> 00:13:50,894
Ex-military. Probably has guns.

234
00:13:50,895 --> 00:13:53,652
Let's track down family members,
drug dealers.

235
00:13:53,653 --> 00:13:55,975
And let's ask our clinic guy...

236
00:13:56,939 --> 00:13:58,942
what's up?
What?

237
00:14:00,551 --> 00:14:02,062
Have you seen this?

238
00:14:10,481 --> 00:14:13,011
Claudette, you knew about this shit?

239
00:14:13,012 --> 00:14:16,247
- I read it.
- Lem gave 12 years to this department,

240
00:14:16,248 --> 00:14:19,909
god knows how many arrests.
****** for any of that.

241
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,826
********************
*******couldn't control the spin.

242
00:14:22,827 --> 00:14:26,994
That's bullshit. Charles is been looking
for corruption goat since he made chief.

243
00:14:26,995 --> 00:14:30,473
- He pinned the horns on lem.
- It's a shitty ending to an ugly story.

244
00:14:30,474 --> 00:14:34,612
And with the bad cop buried,
you and the department get a fresh start, right?

245
00:14:34,613 --> 00:14:37,337
What happened to Lemansky
is an awful thing, I'm sorry.

246
00:14:37,338 --> 00:14:40,257
but he made the choice to stash
the heroin in his car.

247
00:14:40,258 --> 00:14:44,701
- He made the choice to run.
- Kavanaugh browbeat that admission on him.

248
00:14:44,702 --> 00:14:47,048
then he threatened him
to dump him in Antwon's bottom bunk.

249
00:14:47,049 --> 00:14:51,546
- He ran 'cause he was scared.
- He forced lem to make another deal.

250
00:14:51,547 --> 00:14:53,521
What are you talking about?

251
00:14:55,801 --> 00:15:00,326
Becca said that lem made a second deal
with kavanaugh and the chief.

252
00:15:00,327 --> 00:15:02,492
The only way lemansky would make another deal

253
00:15:02,493 --> 00:15:05,765
was if he turned in other dirty cops, and he didn't.

254
00:15:05,766 --> 00:15:08,859
- What?
- It was the same deal.

255
00:15:08,904 --> 00:15:11,699
He was willing to do more time if I.A.D. could assure him

256
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,026
they keep him out of antwon's reach.

257
00:15:14,027 --> 00:15:17,040
- He was killed before it went through.
- No.

258
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:20,589
Police council is making a formal statement this evening.

259
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:23,261
We'll be as respectful as we can.

260
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:26,030
Let me guess.

261
00:15:26,557 --> 00:15:30,703
- That respectful face is aceveda's.
- What do you think?

262
00:15:34,665 --> 00:15:38,126
aceveda said that lem gave us up,

263
00:15:38,161 --> 00:15:41,552
that he told him about the money train.

264
00:15:41,561 --> 00:15:43,124
Kavanaugh must've heard a rumor,

265
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:45,882
*************************
******** put us in motion.

266
00:15:45,883 --> 00:15:47,991
And we goddamn ate it up.

267
00:15:49,477 --> 00:15:52,333
Made me think my own guy turned on me.

268
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:57,920
Hey, julien, what the hell is kavanaugh doing here?

269
00:15:57,921 --> 00:16:01,397
Heard he's working lemansky's murder with dutch.

270
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:18,460
According to his visa stamp,

271
00:16:18,461 --> 00:16:22,691
**********************************
******** lemansky was killed.

272
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:40,006
He says he's got 2 cousins who saw him kill lemansky.

273
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,487
Um, cousins got addresses?

274
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:47,770
He doesn't know.

275
00:16:47,771 --> 00:16:50,538
- Right.
- I need a minute with you.

276
00:16:51,421 --> 00:16:52,089
Ok.

277
00:16:52,185 --> 00:16:56,592
Um, run the cousins' names through i.n.s., dmv.

278
00:16:56,701 --> 00:16:58,911
See if you can find addresses.

279
00:17:07,295 --> 00:17:09,691
Kavanaugh's working lem's murder?

280
00:17:10,142 --> 00:17:13,627
- An angle of it, and it's not my choice.
- Which angle?

281
00:17:13,628 --> 00:17:15,911
He didn't really go into any detail.

282
00:17:15,912 --> 00:17:18,184
Don't dick me around, dutchman.

283
00:17:21,613 --> 00:17:23,162
You're the angle.

284
00:17:46,006 --> 00:17:47,352
Hey.

285
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,786
Oh, hey. Oh, i'm sorry.

286
00:17:51,841 --> 00:17:54,287
That's ok. I was just taking a minute.

287
00:17:54,288 --> 00:17:55,805
Oh, my god.

288
00:17:56,009 --> 00:17:58,058
Wow. He's big.

289
00:17:59,097 --> 00:18:01,475
He's beefy and happy.

290
00:18:01,913 --> 00:18:03,400
You mind if, uh...

291
00:18:03,568 --> 00:18:07,573
- No. Here.
- Hey. It's ok.

292
00:18:08,872 --> 00:18:10,482
I just had to take care of some insurance stuff,

293
00:18:10,483 --> 00:18:13,525
- so i thought i'd show him off.
- Yeah.

294
00:18:14,776 --> 00:18:17,432
- He's beautiful, danielle.
- Thanks.

295
00:18:20,452 --> 00:18:21,830
- See you.
- Yeah.

296
00:18:23,414 --> 00:18:24,572

I know this must be the grief talking.

306
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:04,136
At what point do your bosses realize
you're as delusional as that sick,

What the hell was that?

315
00:19:39,736 --> 00:19:43,315
It's not the first time.
He and mackey went at it at lemansky's crime scene.

316
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:47,727
- Took 9 unis to break it up.
- Shhhh. This is you being discreet?

317
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:51,197

Emolia Melendez.

328
00:20:27,449 --> 00:20:29,838
Vic used her to get a message to the el salvadorans.

329
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:33,265
She set up Lem's murder for Vic.

330
00:20:37,558 --> 00:20:41,084
You told Dutch that you didn't know where she was.

331
00:20:41,085 --> 00:20:42,623

343
00:21:22,955 --> 00:21:25,756
Great. I'll give him a call.

344
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:32,176
Emolia, it's jon. Jon kavanaugh.

345
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:36,708
- What the hell are you doing here?
- You alone?

346
00:21:36,709 --> 00:21:39,541
Sebastio's at my mom's. Why?

347
00:21:40,455 --> 00:21:43,089
The detective said he wasn't coming here, right?

348
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:44,795
No. What's the matter?

349
00:21:45,593 --> 00:21:46,938
No toys.

350
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:52,112
- What, Sebastio's spending all this time at your mom's?
- Yeah. He's safe there.

351
00:21:52,113 --> 00:21:53,839
What are you afraid of?

352
00:21:54,741 --> 00:21:56,556
I snitched on guardo.

353
00:21:56,782 --> 00:22:00,177
People know. They want me dead.

354
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:01,784
What about Vic?

355
00:22:02,504 --> 00:22:05,481
- He hasn't got your back now?
- Vic ain't shit for me.

356
00:22:05,482 --> 00:22:06,920
Not taking care of you anymore?

357
00:22:06,921 --> 00:22:10,707
Him and his guys shit all over me.
Called sebastio a retard.

358
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:13,328
That's wrong. I'm sorry about that.

359
00:22:14,726 --> 00:22:17,582
But i have a way to make things right.

360
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:25,401
Jesus.

361
00:22:25,821 --> 00:22:27,385
Lem didn't rat.

362
00:22:28,621 --> 00:22:31,899
You made me believe my own guy turned on me.

363
00:22:33,076 --> 00:22:35,444
I have people waiting in my office.

364
00:22:35,445 --> 00:22:38,797
You were in bed with kavanaugh the whole time.

365
00:22:38,918 --> 00:22:42,109
Y'know, Kavanaugh played us both.
Squeezed me, too.

366
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,332
- I had no choice.
- Bullshit.

367
00:22:44,623 --> 00:22:48,955
Your jones to hurt me ********
*********he was doing to lem.

368
00:22:49,614 --> 00:22:51,623
You knew about the antwon threat.

369
00:22:51,624 --> 00:22:54,580
That scare put him on the run,
got him killed.

370
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:57,569
What, so it's my fault? Huh?

371
00:22:58,145 --> 00:23:00,553
When do you ever take responsibility, Vic?

372
00:23:00,554 --> 00:23:02,311
When is anything your fault?

373
00:23:02,312 --> 00:23:05,096
- If you weren't a heartbeat away from being forced out right now--
- what?

374
00:23:05,097 --> 00:23:08,539
What? You'd take my badge?
Go ahead.

375
00:23:09,834 --> 00:23:13,906
Is that what you and Kavanaugh want?
Take it all. Here.

376
00:23:14,512 --> 00:23:15,842
Take it!

377
00:23:16,417 --> 00:23:17,699
What the hell are you doing?

378
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,426
You wanna end a career?

379
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:23,034
you do it straight up,
to someone who's still alive,

380
00:23:23,035 --> 00:23:26,139
who could still look you right in the eye!

381
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:30,416
I'm sorry about Lem.

382
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:36,123
Then don't disgrace him!

383
00:23:36,967 --> 00:23:39,220
You know, it's not my fault.

384
00:23:39,837 --> 00:23:41,902
It's not my call.

385
00:23:42,487 --> 00:23:45,045
I'm just the face of the decision.

386
00:24:02,842 --> 00:24:07,958
I say that vic used me as a middleman
to set up the hit on his guy.

387
00:24:08,284 --> 00:24:10,715
Yes. He had it all planned out.

388
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:14,600
Give the exact time and place where lem will be.

389
00:24:14,716 --> 00:24:16,433
We'll go over the exact details later.

390
00:24:16,434 --> 00:24:18,728
this kind of thing.

391
00:24:19,015 --> 00:24:23,547
Vic did this.
I''m just trying to get you to tell the truth.

392
00:24:23,674 --> 00:24:26,424
It's just somebody else's truth, that's all.

393
00:24:26,425 --> 00:24:28,201
I won't get in trouble?

394
00:24:28,451 --> 00:24:34,509
You're gonna tell 'em that he threatened your son,
that, uh... That you were scared

395
00:24:34,696 --> 00:24:36,638
and you had no other choice but to do this.

396
00:24:36,639 --> 00:24:39,900
And i'll get all those things?
A house with a pool.

397
00:24:39,901 --> 00:24:43,096
Monthly checks.
This is real, emolia.

398
00:24:46,001 --> 00:24:47,479
It might be my mom.

399
00:24:48,986 --> 00:24:53,733
Emolia melendez? You in there?
It's detective wagenbach.

400
00:24:54,217 --> 00:24:57,135
I just need to ask you a few questions.

401
00:24:57,486 --> 00:24:59,150
You're not in trouble.

402
00:25:00,226 --> 00:25:02,963
Ma'am? Excuse me.
Ma'am.

403
00:25:05,322 --> 00:25:08,591
I need a place where vic would wanna meet you.

404
00:25:08,592 --> 00:25:12,645
It needs to be a public place where it's not very crowded.

405
00:25:12,646 --> 00:25:14,828
Uh, sewing shop. Um...

406
00:25:15,611 --> 00:25:18,355
Did some work for them the other day.

407
00:25:20,076 --> 00:25:24,873
Do you speak english?
Um, excuse-- gracias.

408
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:29,886
Hello. Wagenbach.
Dutch, jon kavanaugh.

409
00:25:30,409 --> 00:25:32,519
Did the captain call you?
No. Why?

410
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:36,241
Emolia reached out to me.
I'm on my way to meet her.

411
00:25:36,242 --> 00:25:40,646
She's at tama's costura, a sewing shop on haden.

412
00:25:40,647 --> 00:25:42,435
Are you sure about that?

413
00:25:42,765 --> 00:25:44,727
I got some possible 20s from calls her sister made.

414
00:25:44,728 --> 00:25:46,663
I think she's dodging my knock at one of 'em.

415
00:25:46,664 --> 00:25:49,463
You do whatever you want,
but i would think a sewing shop

416
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:53,070
would be a great place
to follow up your guardo lead.
But this is your case.

417
00:25:53,071 --> 00:25:55,745
Ok, i'll meet you there.

418
00:26:01,074 --> 00:26:02,694
And then what did he do?

419
00:26:02,695 --> 00:26:07,400
Shot out the door,
called me a sick shithead, and then tried to cap me.

420
00:26:07,401 --> 00:26:09,723
Got this diving out of the way.

421
00:26:10,389 --> 00:26:14,871
Do you have any idea who it was, axl?
Never seen him before.

422
00:26:15,989 --> 00:26:17,665
Think you could describe him for a sketch artist?

423
00:26:17,666 --> 00:26:20,906
Yeah. I got one of those photogenic memories.

424
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,939
the neighborhood.

425
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,336
Porn's a billion-dollar industry.

426
00:26:29,946 --> 00:26:32,895
What? All i'm saying
is there's a lot of people who are ok with it.

427
00:26:32,896 --> 00:26:36,075
You start knocking on doors across the street.

428
00:26:36,076 --> 00:26:37,567
I'll get these.

429
00:26:39,013 --> 00:26:42,861
You could use some tight-assed lube
yourself, sparky.

430
00:26:42,906 --> 00:26:47,173
What am i supposed to do?
Just sit back and let this shitbag tank my career, too?

431
00:26:47,174 --> 00:26:50,465
He's goddamn poison.
Kavanaugh's not my problem.

432
00:26:50,466 --> 00:26:51,629
Oh, i am?

433
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:54,271
Pensions hasn't received your retirement paperwork.

434
00:26:54,272 --> 00:26:55,726
I'm still sorting that out.

435
00:26:55,727 --> 00:26:59,343
You were supposed to keep a low profile
so you could get out with a piece of your pension.

436
00:26:59,344 --> 00:27:02,324
There's been a lot going on around here.

437
00:27:02,703 --> 00:27:05,397
Phillips thinks too much is going on.

438
00:27:06,885 --> 00:27:10,001
This came directly from the chief's office.

439
00:27:13,592 --> 00:27:15,616
This puts my retirement effective immediately.

440
00:27:15,617 --> 00:27:19,599
You take it now, the chief will see you get a piece of your pension.

441
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,966
Why now?
I had until my 15 mark.

442
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,935
Certain things are in motion.

443
00:27:26,132 --> 00:27:27,617
This is a lifeline.

444
00:27:27,618 --> 00:27:30,410
Sign this, and it'll save us all a lot of grief.
If you don't--

445
00:27:30,411 --> 00:27:31,961
you can't cut me loose.

446
00:27:31,962 --> 00:27:33,107
It's not my idea.

447
00:27:33,108 --> 00:27:35,183
Brass is gonna be watching every move you make

448
00:27:35,184 --> 00:27:37,091
You need me to make this place work.

449
00:27:37,092 --> 00:27:39,308
I need people i can trust.

450
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:45,745
- So you won't help me fight this.
- You know a reason i should?

451
00:27:45,746 --> 00:27:51,034
Quentin showed up at another clinic.
Unis spooked him. He's got hostages.

452
00:27:51,407 --> 00:27:53,853
Who you're gonna trust with that?

453
00:27:56,789 --> 00:27:58,679
All right, boys, here it is.

454
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,748
This guy's got a doctor, a mother

455
00:27:59,749 --> 00:28:03,573
and her 3-month-old son
trapped in an examing room.

456
00:28:03,669 --> 00:28:05,557
He's doused the doc and the mother with gasoline,

457
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:08,429
threatened to use them as kindling
if they didn't shut down all their methadone clinics.

458
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:10,370
Negotiator and swat's 30 minutes out.

459
00:28:10,371 --> 00:28:14,423
Let's go. Shane, you coming?

460
00:28:14,811 --> 00:28:16,526
Yeah. Yeah.

461
00:28:20,425 --> 00:28:21,591
Shit.

462
00:28:21,592 --> 00:28:24,963
needs to seal himself off.

463
00:28:24,964 --> 00:28:27,817
in this place?

464
00:28:28,379 --> 00:28:29,919
Get her out of here.

465
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:32,309
Get me a peeper scope.

466
00:28:32,614 --> 00:28:35,464
I don't want anyone rattling this guy's cage.

467
00:28:35,465 --> 00:28:39,065
I don't want anyone talking to him. Hey.

468
00:28:40,286 --> 00:28:42,220
Are you with me?
Yeah.

469
00:28:42,447 --> 00:28:44,189
'cause ronnie and i can take care of this.

470
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,904
I'm here, man. No, you're not.

471
00:28:45,905 --> 00:28:49,143
I got innocents soaked with gasoline.
I need your head in the game.

472
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,459
It is. I promise. I'm ok.

473
00:29:01,138 --> 00:29:04,241
Can i help you?
You have any idea where vic is?

474
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:07,024
We haven't seen him since lem's memorial.

475
00:29:07,025 --> 00:29:11,975
No, i don't.
I saw him at the barn for a second. That's about it.

476
00:29:11,976 --> 00:29:15,458
You think vic's staying here?
It crossed my mind.

477
00:29:15,459 --> 00:29:17,042
He's not.

478
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:19,137
Sorry.

479
00:29:21,399 --> 00:29:24,240
Ehi, tra Vic e me non c'e' nulla.

480
00:29:26,475 --> 00:29:27,780
What about that thing in your arms?

481
00:29:27,781 --> 00:29:33,389
Whatever shitpile you're cleaning up with your ex,
don't come dumping it on my doorstep.

482
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:36,830
And don't ever call my son a thing,
you uptight bitch.

483
00:29:36,831 --> 00:29:40,190
I'm not uptight, sweetheart.
I'm a realist.

484
00:29:40,191 --> 00:29:43,334
You have no idea what has been dumped
on your doorstep.

485
00:29:43,335 --> 00:29:45,940
Vic. He is not gonna be there for him.

486
00:29:45,941 --> 00:29:47,184
Well, i don't need anyone's help.

487
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:50,859
a full-time cop

488
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:51,675
and take care of this kid all by yourself?

489
00:29:51,676 --> 00:29:53,929
that i won't be able to.

490
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:57,630
And what if they tell you that he's autistic, huh?

491
00:30:01,196 --> 00:30:04,606
My son is fine.
They're all fine at first.

492
00:30:05,374 --> 00:30:10,536
But we have 2 autistic kids,
and there's a genetic predisposition for siblings.

493
00:30:10,537 --> 00:30:12,451
Maybe you're the one with the screwed-up genes.

494
00:30:12,452 --> 00:30:14,972
Maybe. Maybe not. But keep your eyes open

495
00:30:14,973 --> 00:30:19,827
because the sooner the doctors know, the more
they can do for him.

496
00:30:24,452 --> 00:30:26,834
Mom and the doctor are jammed in the corner.

497
00:30:26,835 --> 00:30:29,266
The baby's on a table by the door.

498
00:30:29,267 --> 00:30:31,049
If we can get him to give up the kid,

499
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:33,264
swat can drop down between the junkie and the innocents.

500
00:30:33,265 --> 00:30:35,986
I'll get an e.t.a. On swat and the negotiator.

501
00:30:35,987 --> 00:30:38,921
Jesus christ. Don't hurt that little baby.

502
00:30:38,922 --> 00:30:42,463
Stop! I'm gonna kill this goddamn baby, man.

503
00:30:44,993 --> 00:30:48,632
Everybody just shut the hell up.
I'm gonna kill this goddamn thing.

504
00:30:48,633 --> 00:30:49,765
Ehi, Quentin.

505
00:30:50,198 --> 00:30:52,913
- Shane!
- Quentin!

506
00:30:52,914 --> 00:30:54,305
Listen to me, man.

507
00:30:54,306 --> 00:30:57,955
The reason the baby's crying is 'cause of the gasoline.

508
00:30:57,956 --> 00:31:00,836
The fumes are probably burning his eyes.

509
00:31:02,209 --> 00:31:04,696
What the hell's he doing?
You better get down here.

510
00:31:04,697 --> 00:31:11,625
Just hand the kid over to me, get a little peace and quiet.
Just focus on what you got to do.

511
00:31:13,226 --> 00:31:15,421
Who the hell are you, man?
I'm a cop.

512
00:31:15,422 --> 00:31:16,956
What?
I'm a cop.

513
00:31:16,957 --> 00:31:18,993
Shane vendrell. I'm unarmed.

514
00:31:19,096 --> 00:31:23,507
Just hand over the crying kid
and take me instead.

515
00:31:24,195 --> 00:31:28,217
A quiet detective is a much better bargaining chip, man.

516
00:31:29,275 --> 00:31:34,143
Nah. It's a con.
You're full of shit. Just like everything else.

517
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,398
No, it's not a con. It's--

518
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:43,146
Quentin, listen to me. Open the door, buddy.

519
00:31:43,147 --> 00:31:44,823
Quentin, open the door.

520
00:31:45,202 --> 00:31:50,006
Look, ok. Look.
Look, buddy. You see?
You see?

521
00:31:52,019 --> 00:31:53,463
Oh, my god.

522
00:31:55,674 --> 00:32:00,895
Jesus christ, shane.
It's no con, man.

523
00:32:02,493 --> 00:32:03,859
Get ready to move.

524
00:32:06,921 --> 00:32:09,027
Any point you think i'm lying,

525
00:32:09,028 --> 00:32:11,908
just...you just flick your bic, brother.

526
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,237
Ok?

527
00:32:14,364 --> 00:32:16,264
Don't worry. I will, man.

528
00:32:17,044 --> 00:32:17,873
Shit!

529
00:32:19,422 --> 00:32:20,423
Quentin!

530
00:32:21,174 --> 00:32:22,566
Quentin, listen to me, man.

531
00:32:22,567 --> 00:32:27,329
Is there a closet in there or a cabinet or something?
Somewhere where the baby can breathe.

532
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:28,870
Yeah. I mean, it's--

533
00:32:29,473 --> 00:32:36,351
good. Just put him in there and close the door, ok?
It keeps the fumes out of his eyes.
Shh.

534
00:32:38,701 --> 00:32:40,782
Shh, shh. Shh, shh, shh.

535
00:32:45,583 --> 00:32:47,073
I told you, quentin.

536
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:50,738
I told you, man, you can trust me.

537
00:32:53,249 --> 00:32:56,055
I think this psycho's going for shane.

538
00:33:01,608 --> 00:33:02,672
Right there.

539
00:33:07,323 --> 00:33:08,689
Are you all right?

540
00:33:08,982 --> 00:33:09,706
Yeah.

541
00:33:10,082 --> 00:33:13,248
- Glad you put on a vest.
- Check the kid.

542
00:33:17,501 --> 00:33:21,213
You wanna tell me what the hell happened back here?

543
00:33:23,349 --> 00:33:26,949
We just saved 3 innocents from a homicidal junkie.

544
00:33:27,558 --> 00:33:31,152
Maybe you could draw up the paperwork
and let me sign it.

545
00:33:31,153 --> 00:33:31,842
Ahh!

546
00:33:36,093 --> 00:33:39,738
- Aaaah! You lied.
- You lied to me.

547
00:33:40,004 --> 00:33:41,099
You lied!

548
00:33:45,188 --> 00:33:48,645
the sex shop this morning.

549
00:33:48,734 --> 00:33:52,420
- Black, early 20s, earrings.
- Narrows things down.

550
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:57,635
I don't have anybody free.
Could you jump on this porn shop shooting?

551
00:33:57,636 --> 00:34:00,412
Sounds titillating, but i'm still a little woozy.

552
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:02,540
That's what i get for trying to keep the peace, right?

553
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:04,011
Maybe you should go home.

554
00:34:04,012 --> 00:34:06,941
I leave now it chews up one of my personal days.

555
00:34:06,942 --> 00:34:09,773
I'm gonna hang and clean up some paperwork.

556
00:34:09,774 --> 00:34:10,696
I'll be ok.

557
00:34:10,697 --> 00:34:11,644
Thank god.

558
00:34:12,708 --> 00:34:16,257
Circulate it to the skin joints, bookstores. See if he's a regular.

559
00:34:16,258 --> 00:34:16,899
Ok.

560
00:34:18,635 --> 00:34:22,818
Dmv didn't have any of the addresses
on the cousins of the el salvadoran we questioned

561
00:34:22,819 --> 00:34:24,343
And i'm still waiting on i.n.s.

562
00:34:24,344 --> 00:34:25,447
Good girl.

563
00:34:30,293 --> 00:34:31,279
Good girl?

564
00:34:31,404 --> 00:34:33,750
It's part of my new mentoring philosophy.

565
00:34:33,751 --> 00:34:34,533
Right.

566
00:34:35,973 --> 00:34:38,850
I thought you were meeting kavanaugh and picking up emolia.

567
00:34:38,851 --> 00:34:44,115
Me, too. Sent me to the sewing shop.
It was closed. No one ever showed.

568
00:34:46,059 --> 00:34:49,562
Vic said i should tell guardo
i was sorry for turning on him.

569
00:34:49,563 --> 00:34:52,270
Offer up my handler asrestitucion.

570
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:56,675
He knew that guardo would wanna hurt the cop
that crushed his drug protection comeback.

571
00:34:56,676 --> 00:34:59,523
Jesus. You told 'em it was lem.

572
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:03,763
They gave me the place, the time.
I set it up.

573
00:35:04,107 --> 00:35:06,596
Told him it was a blond cop i've been working for.

574
00:35:06,597 --> 00:35:09,444
You did this because vic threatened your son.

575
00:35:09,445 --> 00:35:11,994
Said if i did it, he'd give me 500 bucks.

576
00:35:11,995 --> 00:35:16,375
If i didn't,
that much.

577
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:18,222
What choice did i have?

578
00:35:18,223 --> 00:35:19,651
You have the money?

579
00:35:19,819 --> 00:35:24,387
No. He was supposed to drop it off at the
sewing shop yesterday. He never did.

580
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:28,440
I got scared.
Figured if he could off his own guy that way,

581
00:35:28,441 --> 00:35:30,729
what's to stop him from killing me and my boy?

582
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:32,630
That's why she called me.

583
00:35:32,654 --> 00:35:36,568
I got a man staying with her mother and with her son right now.

584
00:35:36,569 --> 00:35:39,354
Yeah. I just want us all to be safe.

585
00:35:40,011 --> 00:35:41,685
Far away from vic.

586
00:35:42,311 --> 00:35:43,952
Phillips is on his way.

587
00:35:43,953 --> 00:35:46,551
into more of these details.

588
00:35:47,565 --> 00:35:48,644
You did fine.

589
00:35:55,506 --> 00:35:58,759
Hey, uh, what happened to you?
I went to the sewing shop.

590
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,312
Oh, sorry about that.

591
00:36:00,496 --> 00:36:04,735
Emolia moved the meeting place 3 times after i talked to you.

592
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:06,685
Where'd you finally meet her?

593
00:36:06,686 --> 00:36:09,380
Behind sid's. Coffee place on wilton.

594
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:12,558
That place across from the 101 on-ramp?

595
00:36:13,164 --> 00:36:16,580
I think so. I think so.
Ask emolia. She'd know.

596
00:36:16,581 --> 00:36:19,453
- Anyway, no harm, no foul.
- Yeah.

597
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:24,423
Ow.

598
00:36:25,065 --> 00:36:27,859
Easy. Ow! I know you're pissed at me.

599
00:36:27,943 --> 00:36:31,259
I don't give a shit if i hear from you, ok?

600
00:36:31,338 --> 00:36:32,659
I'll make it up to the kids.

601
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:35,663
Hope you have another bag of cash put aside
for the years of therapy they're gonna need.

602
00:36:35,664 --> 00:36:38,346
- Don't say that.
- Cass is just like you.

603
00:36:38,347 --> 00:36:40,598
- She internalizes everything.
- Hey.

604
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:41,695
You doing ok?

605
00:36:41,921 --> 00:36:43,768
Yeah. I'll live,

606
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,321
as long as my ex isn't the one taking care of me.

607
00:36:46,322 --> 00:36:48,262
- Hey, corrine.
- Hey.

608
00:36:48,653 --> 00:36:52,353
We're gonna need an x ray of that shoulder.
Yeah.

609
00:36:54,958 --> 00:36:56,177
How you feeling?

610
00:36:56,474 --> 00:36:57,272
Good.

611
00:36:57,616 --> 00:36:59,813
I still smell a little like diesel.

612
00:36:59,814 --> 00:37:01,974
Just like ronnie's aftershave.

613
00:37:06,785 --> 00:37:08,933
What the hell was that today?

614
00:37:10,118 --> 00:37:11,947
I just saw a way to make your plan work.

615
00:37:11,948 --> 00:37:15,176
My plan wasn't turning you into a duraflame.

616
00:37:15,514 --> 00:37:18,320
I've had enough funerals for one week.

617
00:37:18,706 --> 00:37:21,028
It was just my own little spin.

618
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:25,256
You can put another one in the win column,
though, right?

619
00:37:26,359 --> 00:37:27,610
Listen, man.

620
00:37:28,377 --> 00:37:31,729
We've all been beating ourselves up about lem.

621
00:37:32,085 --> 00:37:34,221
But it's like you said, man.

622
00:37:35,116 --> 00:37:36,656
It's nobody's fault.

623
00:37:37,244 --> 00:37:39,231
- Except guardo's.
- Yeah.

624
00:37:39,372 --> 00:37:41,453
Hey. Come here.

625
00:37:45,485 --> 00:37:48,270
my retirement.

626
00:37:49,545 --> 00:37:51,256
I'm not sure why, but i don't have much time.

627
00:37:51,257 --> 00:37:55,739
- No, man.
- That's why you can't get reckless. You hear me?

628
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:59,884
I'm gonna need your help to finish this thing.

629
00:38:00,655 --> 00:38:02,853
I can't lose you, too, shane.

630
00:38:05,129 --> 00:38:06,114
You won't.

631
00:38:15,344 --> 00:38:16,704
This doesn't add up.

632
00:38:16,705 --> 00:38:21,101
The pieces fit. Motive, timing.
He's got a compelling case.

633
00:38:22,357 --> 00:38:26,455
You and i both know vic is a cop with questionable ethics.

634
00:38:26,456 --> 00:38:30,056
He capable of killing another cop? Maybe. But lem?

635
00:38:30,591 --> 00:38:31,982
Her story's a little neat.

636
00:38:31,983 --> 00:38:35,894
I'm at the last house on the d.e.a. List.
I knock. I definitely hear someone inside.

637
00:38:35,895 --> 00:38:39,982
Maybe 2 people. They don't come to the door.
Then i get a call from kavanaugh

638
00:38:39,983 --> 00:38:43,111
sending me off and running to the sewing shop?

639
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:44,254
Seems strange.

640
00:38:45,198 --> 00:38:47,717
You think he's pushing the story?

641
00:38:48,452 --> 00:38:49,235
Lying?

642
00:38:49,892 --> 00:38:51,413
That doesn't fit either.

643
00:38:51,414 --> 00:38:56,082
for his ex-wife
when any other cop in this building would have.

644
00:38:57,969 --> 00:38:59,393
I know that look.

645
00:39:00,676 --> 00:39:02,228
Something's not right

646
00:39:02,936 --> 00:39:05,251
Chief wants vic on the retired list

647
00:39:05,252 --> 00:39:09,185
before we file any charges.
He's not going without a fight.

648
00:39:09,186 --> 00:39:11,198
What do you want me to do?

649
00:39:12,117 --> 00:39:17,232
Stick to the guardo angle.
Bring vic in for questioning.
See what he has to say about emolia's story.

650
00:39:17,233 --> 00:39:17,875
Ok.

651
00:39:21,677 --> 00:39:23,515
I'm gonna head home now.

652
00:39:23,742 --> 00:39:26,729
I might need to take that personal day tomorrow.

653
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:29,102
Oh, we'll try to fill the void.

654
00:39:30,742 --> 00:39:31,822
Uh, vic.

655
00:39:32,698 --> 00:39:34,167
You cruising for interns?

656
00:39:34,168 --> 00:39:35,247
How's the shoulder?

657
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:36,969
Kevlar is my friend.

658
00:39:39,446 --> 00:39:43,498
Kavanaugh's brought in a witness
to kill lem.

659
00:39:45,031 --> 00:39:46,032
What witness?

660
00:39:46,611 --> 00:39:48,160
Emolia melendez.

661
00:39:51,028 --> 00:39:52,764
What's kavanaugh offering her?

662
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:54,282
Witness protection.

663
00:39:55,628 --> 00:39:57,269
So you're here to arrest me?

664
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:59,878
- Right now i just need a statement.
- You think I did it?

665
00:39:59,879 --> 00:40:00,646
Lem?

666
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,432
I need to take you back to the barn.

667
00:40:05,751 --> 00:40:07,487
I can drive myself.

668
00:40:12,582 --> 00:40:14,718
Ok. I'll see you back there.

669
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:32,192
Mackey's lawyer will paint her as a paid snitch,
for her testimony.

670
00:40:32,367 --> 00:40:34,759
There's no evidence backing this story.

671
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:38,311
That's why i wanna continue this investigation.
This report is not complete yet.

672
00:40:38,312 --> 00:40:41,502
What about wagenbach's el salvadoran suspect?

673
00:40:41,508 --> 00:40:45,294
I've seen dutch cozy up to mackey.
I don't know where his loyalty lands.

674
00:40:45,295 --> 00:40:52,347
We need to get him off this lemansky case.
We don't want another guy tipped off and on the run.

675
00:40:53,243 --> 00:40:53,900
Ok.

676
00:40:57,139 --> 00:41:02,185
I'll talk to wyms about him.
But this time if you can't keep it from becoming personal,

677
00:41:02,186 --> 00:41:07,223
i'll go disciplinary on you, jon.
You'll lose those lt bars. You hear that?

678
00:41:07,224 --> 00:41:11,768
I hear it.
Tell the chief he's got my word. Nothing personal.

679
00:41:17,732 --> 00:41:18,676
What's this?

680
00:41:18,863 --> 00:41:23,868
Requesting today's footage from the 101 freeway cam
at the wilton on-ramp

681
00:41:23,869 --> 00:41:26,904
across from sid's coffee.
Just a hunch.

682
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:28,412
Any sign of vic?

683
00:41:28,661 --> 00:41:29,662
Not yet.

684
00:41:29,934 --> 00:41:32,628
Captain, a guy fitting the description of
our sex shop shooter

685
00:41:32,629 --> 00:41:34,041
was seen in 4 other video stores today.

686
00:41:34,042 --> 00:41:36,488
He bought out every copy of that.

687
00:41:38,255 --> 00:41:41,550
I am not familiar with thedick 'n' grannyseries.

00:42:19,877 --> 00:42:22,736
Shit.
Number 3....

700
00:42:22,816 --> 00:42:27,193
Forgot her name.
First-timer. She was raw.

701
00:42:27,304 --> 00:42:30,824
But in the end, i always get a good performance.

702
00:42:30,825 --> 00:42:33,231
We need a name and address.

703
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:35,290
It's vic.

704
00:42:36,259 --> 00:42:37,147
Yeah.

705
00:42:37,403 --> 00:42:41,036
Anyone ever tell you that you have incredibly expressive eyes?

706
00:42:41,037 --> 00:42:42,701
Ever been on film?

707
00:42:43,169 --> 00:42:45,010
Ever been in a mug book?

708
00:42:48,037 --> 00:42:51,022
Family emergency. He can't come in right now.

709
00:42:51,023 --> 00:42:55,367
He'll run out of emergencies,
then we'll get to the truth.

710
00:42:55,368 --> 00:42:58,658
Hard to believe this place was ever a church.

711
00:42:58,897 --> 00:43:03,270
We can track down axl's granny in the morning.
It's been a long day.

712
00:43:03,271 --> 00:43:06,323
I'm ok. I'll wait for the address and follow it up tonight.

713
00:43:06,324 --> 00:43:10,174
It's your first week. You can't keep up this kind of pace.

714
00:43:10,175 --> 00:43:12,869
Now, i'm just talking general health.

715
00:43:13,033 --> 00:43:15,479
You got to take care of yourself.

716
00:43:16,827 --> 00:43:20,654
******** these pews?

717
00:43:19,655 --> 00:43:20,655
Of course.

718
00:43:21,469 --> 00:43:24,392
Phillips paid me a visit today.

719
00:43:26,499 --> 00:43:32,459
If i don't turn this place around
before the quarterly statistics come out,

720
00:43:32,796 --> 00:43:36,632
they might be saying mass down there again real soon.

721
00:43:46,884 --> 00:43:52,322
I'm captain wyms. Sorry to disturb you so late,
ma'am. You know this man?

722
00:43:56,249 --> 00:43:57,557
Edmond!

723
00:43:58,349 --> 00:43:59,463
Edmond!

724
00:44:00,294 --> 00:44:01,118
Stop!

725
00:44:01,344 --> 00:44:03,427
Stop! Drop the gun!

726
00:44:03,587 --> 00:44:04,959
Drop that gun.

727
00:44:05,282 --> 00:44:09,029
Drop the gun.
Please, kid, just drop the gun.

728
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:10,240
Please don't make me shoot you.

729
00:44:10,241 --> 00:44:13,516
- Drop the gun, asshole, or i will shoot.
- Edmond, don't!

730
00:44:13,517 --> 00:44:15,504
Drop the gun, goddamn it!

731
00:44:16,004 --> 00:44:18,185
- Do it now!
- Drop the gun.

732
00:44:18,928 --> 00:44:20,294
Get on your knees.

733
00:44:20,476 --> 00:44:25,068
- Why did you do it, grandma?
- Get ****************** right now!

734
00:44:27,195 --> 00:44:30,083
How could you let that man do that to you?

735
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:33,927
He got arrested for stealing a car 6 months ago.

736
00:44:34,557 --> 00:44:36,835
I neede his bail money.

737
00:44:37,851 --> 00:44:42,333
You shouldn't have done it, grandma.
Why'd you be his whore?

738
00:44:47,022 --> 00:44:48,810
What are you doing here?

739
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:53,239
You got emolia to lie for you.

740
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:56,968
Now you know the difference between a lie and a truth?

741
00:44:56,969 --> 00:44:59,053
You think i'm a cop killer.

742
00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:02,267
Maybe i am.

743
00:45:05,059 --> 00:45:07,982
You're a cop.
Right?

744
00:45:10,935 --> 00:45:16,698
That sounds like a direct threat on my life,
detective. You know what that means?

745
00:45:16,699 --> 00:45:21,143
It means you just stepped
onto an entirely new playing field.

746
00:45:21,777 --> 00:45:23,425
And for your sake,

747
00:45:24,232 --> 00:45:27,088
i hope you know the rules of the game.

748
00:45:29,867 --> 00:45:33,597
That it? You came all the way down here
just to blow words by me?

749
00:45:33,598 --> 00:45:35,200
It's a street tactic.

750
00:45:35,293 --> 00:45:38,666
Always let the bad guy know you're on to his game.

751
00:45:38,667 --> 00:45:41,994
Makes him change tact so he makes mistakes.

752
00:45:42,123 --> 00:45:47,566
Then i guess i should let you know
****************    of curtis lemansky.

753
00:45:48,323 --> 00:45:53,227
There are unis at your house,
and they're waiting to bring you in.

754
00:45:58,867 --> 00:46:00,127
Gabino Guiz?

755
00:46:00,165 --> 00:46:03,007
This is the address i.n.s. Gave me for the cousin.

756
00:46:03,008 --> 00:46:06,464
Nobody home. What a shock. Let's go.

757
00:46:26,173 --> 00:46:27,949
Oh, that's gross.

758
00:46:29,384 --> 00:46:32,598
Dutch. Bloody cat prints.

759
00:46:43,953 --> 00:46:45,877
Crime scene. Tread lightly.

760
00:46:48,881 --> 00:46:52,450
6- paul-32 requesting 4 additional units

761
00:46:52,547 --> 00:46:55,697
and csu
at 89 san marcos.

762
00:46:55,759 --> 00:47:01,670
I've got multiple 187s,
3, possibly 4...

763
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:14,599
you got to be shitting me.

764
00:47:15,217 --> 00:47:19,416
- They're asleep.
- I just didn't feel like going home.

765
00:47:20,593 --> 00:47:23,322
I'm sorry i dropped out this week.

766
00:47:23,807 --> 00:47:26,315
They just need to hear your voice.

767
00:47:28,045 --> 00:47:30,122
- What is it?
- K*********************

768
00:47:30,123 --> 00:47:31,825
with lem's death.

769
00:47:32,081 --> 00:47:34,762
Oh, my god. That's ridiculous.

770
00:47:34,826 --> 00:47:37,968
He got some low-life c.i. To lie for him.

771
00:47:38,031 --> 00:47:40,260
What are you gonna do?

772
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,010
<i>i'll get right to it.</i>

773
00:47:44,086 --> 00:47:46,766
<i>Last year captain rawling initiated an inquiry</i>

774
00:47:46,767 --> 00:47:49,585
<i>into the farmington gang and drug unit.</i>

775
00:47:50,134 --> 00:47:51,958
<i>Supervised by lieutenant kavanaugh...</i>

776
00:47:51,959 --> 00:47:56,171
from i.a.d., this department conducted
a 7-month investigation...

777
00:47:56,172 --> 00:47:59,789
- Daddy!
- Get out! Go back in your room right now!

778
00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:01,964
I'm sorry. I just didn't want her to see.

779
00:48:01,965 --> 00:48:05,403
<i>...., he fled justice,
became a wanted fugitive.</i>

780
00:48:05,583 --> 00:48:10,405
<i>No doubt the thought of spending years in prison
was a frightening proposition.</i>

781
00:48:10,406 --> 00:48:15,408
<i>We'll never know what triggered
detective lemansky's reluctance to....</i>

782
00:48:15,879 --> 00:48:21,713
serve his time. Because less than
24 hours later, he was found brutally murdered.

783
00:48:22,346 --> 00:48:26,778
Someone dropped a live grenade
in the front seat of his car.

784
00:48:28,232 --> 00:48:33,880
That murder investigation is ongoing
and as of yet no suspects are in custody.

785
00:48:36,851 --> 00:48:41,329
***************************
*********************friends and family.

786
00:48:42,392 --> 00:48:45,570
But within this tragedy, there is a message,

787
00:48:45,671 --> 00:48:50,041
and one that i hope will shake
this department to its core.

788
00:48:51,935 --> 00:48:56,565
Breaking the law and wearing a badge
is a dangerous combination,

789
00:48:57,327 --> 00:48:59,620
and this city will not tolerate it.

790
00:48:59,621 --> 00:49:02,512
This department will not tolerate it.

791
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:13,144
It's the primary objective of this police council
over the next 18 months

792
00:49:13,145 --> 00:49:16,149
to squash corruption within our own ranks.

793
00:49:20,959 --> 00:49:25,965
And cops involved in any illegal activities
will be rooted out.

794
00:49:26,223 --> 00:49:31,735
They will be relieved of duty
and prosecuted to the full extent of the law,

795
00:49:32,916 --> 00:49:37,573
just as detective curtis lemansky was being prosecuted
for his corrupt actions.

796
00:49:37,574 --> 00:49:40,368
- You son of a bitch.
- This community needs police officers...

797
00:49:40,369 --> 00:49:43,745
who are peaceful and trustworthy civil servants.

798
00:49:43,871 --> 00:49:50,461
It's our goal to return dignity
and respect to the badge...

799
00:49:55,804 --> 00:50:00,274
And to the men and women who wear one
a reason to be proud.

800
00:50:05,905 --> 00:50:07,665
Nothing personal.
