00:00:00,246 --> 00:00:01,492
<i>Previously on The Shield...</i>

2
00:00:01,493 --> 00:00:03,144
Got 12 dead mexicans slaughtered

3
00:00:03,145 --> 00:00:04,605
in their house in San Marcos.

4
00:00:04,804 --> 00:00:05,740
But no arrests.

5
00:00:05,741 --> 00:00:06,616
I'll make some calls.

6
00:00:06,617 --> 00:00:09,577
A name keeps popping up
in my interviews. Hernan.

7
00:00:09,578 --> 00:00:11,949
Hernan is undercover in
the salvadoran organization.

8
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:13,555
Stop trying to contact him.

9
00:00:13,556 --> 00:00:14,967
Hey, Moses!
I thought we told you

10
00:00:14,968 --> 00:00:16,554
to stay away from between her pussy.

11
00:00:16,555 --> 00:00:17,807
You're gonna stop seeing that asshole.

12
00:00:17,808 --> 00:00:18,808
I know.

13
00:00:20,118 --> 00:00:21,494
So this guy targets runaways.

14
00:00:21,495 --> 00:00:23,161
While telling them to go home.

15
00:00:23,431 --> 00:00:25,304
There's another girl.
Came in 6 months ago.

16
00:00:25,305 --> 00:00:26,306
We didn't believe her.

17
00:00:26,307 --> 00:00:28,868
Congratulations on getting
another girl ass raped.

18
00:00:28,869 --> 00:00:31,184
Anything you can tell us...
Where he held you?

19
00:00:31,185 --> 00:00:32,351
It was a girl's room.

20
00:00:32,464 --> 00:00:33,219
Posters on the wall

21
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,865
were all white boys
in these gay poses.

22
00:00:35,866 --> 00:00:38,181
This Kevin Hiatt is ours
starting next week.

23
00:00:38,182 --> 00:00:39,742
You're not adding
anybody to my team

24
00:00:39,743 --> 00:00:41,054
that I don't have approval of.

25
00:00:41,055 --> 00:00:43,055
He's not your addition.
He's your replacement.

26
00:00:43,056 --> 00:00:45,680
Hiatt's decided to add another
member to the Strike Team.

27
00:00:45,681 --> 00:00:47,181
I suggested you.
All right.

28
00:00:47,369 --> 00:00:48,369
Shane?

29
00:00:49,745 --> 00:00:51,072
Lem, I'm sorry!

30
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:52,699
But I had to, right?

31
00:00:52,897 --> 00:00:54,495
We're gonna find out who did this.

32
00:00:54,496 --> 00:00:55,414
And we're gonna kill him.

33
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:56,173
It's Guardo.

34
00:00:56,263 --> 00:00:58,086
He stepped on his
protection plate twice.

35
00:00:58,696 --> 00:01:00,141
You know, maybe he didn't do it, man!

36
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,704
If it wasn't Guardo, who was it?!

37
00:01:01,807 --> 00:01:03,195
Well, let's get him, man!

38
00:01:26,749 --> 00:01:28,187
Found him swirling in a gutter.

39
00:01:28,369 --> 00:01:29,182
Conscious?

40
00:01:29,183 --> 00:01:30,183
In and out.

41
00:01:30,495 --> 00:01:31,933
Contusions, possible fractures.

42
00:01:31,934 --> 00:01:32,934
Vitals are stable.

43
00:01:33,435 --> 00:01:34,401
Put him in curtain two.

44
00:01:34,402 --> 00:01:35,414
All right.

45
00:01:35,685 --> 00:01:38,055
Call the resident to check
for internal bleeding.

46
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,369
Better tell him to hurry.

47
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,620
Thought you said he was stable.

48
00:01:40,621 --> 00:01:42,009
He is, but we found this.

49
00:01:43,058 --> 00:01:44,058
He's a cop.

50
00:01:49,124 --> 00:01:49,973
Shane?

51
00:01:55,744 --> 00:01:57,521
Corrine, what the hell happened?

52
00:01:57,558 --> 00:01:59,746
He was beaten pretty badly
and doesn't remember how.

53
00:01:59,747 --> 00:02:00,747
Where? When?

54
00:02:00,748 --> 00:02:02,620
They found him a few blocks from here.

55
00:02:02,621 --> 00:02:03,746
Oh, man.

56
00:02:03,934 --> 00:02:05,120
No shit from you guys.

57
00:02:05,121 --> 00:02:06,809
Already took
one pounding today.

58
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:07,694
What happened?

59
00:02:07,695 --> 00:02:09,573
I was walking to my truck,
next thing I know

60
00:02:09,574 --> 00:02:11,218
I'm coming to in a meat wagon.

61
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:12,656
You didn't see anyone?

62
00:02:12,657 --> 00:02:14,060
Left my wallet.

63
00:02:14,561 --> 00:02:15,561
Badge, gun.

64
00:02:15,562 --> 00:02:17,372
Think it might've been the salvadorans?

65
00:02:17,373 --> 00:02:19,057
Some lame ass attempt at one of us?

66
00:02:19,058 --> 00:02:19,972
Payback for Guardo?

67
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,533
We wouldn't be having
this conversation.

68
00:02:22,623 --> 00:02:25,289
This was just a good
old-fashioned shit-kicking.

69
00:02:25,501 --> 00:02:28,334
It was probably some asshole
we sent up, fresh out.

70
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:31,370
I'll run down recent releases,
check in with the P.O.'s.

71
00:02:31,371 --> 00:02:32,815
Tell me something first...

72
00:02:33,124 --> 00:02:34,124
Who's this guy?

73
00:02:36,624 --> 00:02:39,558
New girlfriend likes baby
smooth skin between her thighs.

74
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:41,114
You should have her call me.

75
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:46,532
Oh, my god.

76
00:02:47,749 --> 00:02:48,749
What happened?

77
00:02:49,251 --> 00:02:50,624
What the doctors say?

78
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:51,958
The X-rays are all good.

79
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:54,184
I'll get working on who did this.

80
00:02:54,185 --> 00:02:55,685
Baby, what happened to you?

81
00:03:03,497 --> 00:03:05,575

<i>Haunts</i>

84
00:03:14,149 --> 00:03:15,161
How's Shane doing?

85
00:03:15,533 --> 00:03:16,821
Hurting for certain.

86
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:19,146
Not especially pleasing
to the eye at the moment.

87
00:03:19,147 --> 00:03:20,898
I'm going to post a protective detail

88
00:03:20,899 --> 00:03:22,834
outside his room until we know more.

89
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:24,895
What do you know about
the San Marcos house murders?

90
00:03:24,896 --> 00:03:26,190
I heard about them.
Grisly stuff.

91
00:03:26,191 --> 00:03:27,898
Yeah.
Robbery homicide's running with it.

92
00:03:27,899 --> 00:03:30,399
We got the hand-off.
Aceveda's all over this.

93
00:03:30,838 --> 00:03:33,760
10 days ago my detective
found 12 bodies, hacked to pieces.

94
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:35,349
Well, 11 bodies, one arm.

95
00:03:35,522 --> 00:03:37,458
Machete's the weapon of
choice for the salvadorans.

96
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:40,147
Which supports the tip that
Aceveda's cronies gave us,

97
00:03:40,148 --> 00:03:42,021
that the killers were el salvadorians,

98
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:43,896
the victims were all mexican illegals.

99
00:03:43,897 --> 00:03:44,897
3 women, 9 men.

100
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:46,398
I.d.'s?

101
00:03:46,399 --> 00:03:47,334
All but the arm.

102
00:03:47,335 --> 00:03:48,898
Mexican government had
them in their system.

103
00:03:48,899 --> 00:03:50,335
If you can call that a system.

104
00:03:50,336 --> 00:03:51,774
The men were all from the same prison.

105
00:03:51,775 --> 00:03:53,349
Released 2 days before
the bodies were found.

106
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:54,198
It's all in the there.

107
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:56,586
This becomes
the Strike Team's top priority now.

108
00:03:56,587 --> 00:03:58,336
Solving it quickly
is the difference

109
00:03:58,337 --> 00:04:01,281
between keeping the barn
open or closing it for good.

110
00:04:01,525 --> 00:04:02,774
They're shutting
this place down?

111
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:04,959
Not if you put a dozen murders
in the win column.

112
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,587
Make our closure rate
too good-looking to lose us.

113
00:04:07,588 --> 00:04:09,588
Get with Dutch.
He found the bodies.

114
00:04:10,087 --> 00:04:12,975
Uh, the barn going out of
business stays between us.

115
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,288
Last thing Farmington needs
is cops who feel like lame ducks.

116
00:04:19,037 --> 00:04:20,870
Alright. Let's have a look at it.

117
00:04:22,024 --> 00:04:23,024
Give me a sec?

118
00:04:25,462 --> 00:04:26,627
So far, no one on the street's bragging

119
00:04:26,628 --> 00:04:28,335
about giving Shane a beat down.

120
00:04:28,336 --> 00:04:31,711
All right. Well, have the units
keep their eyes and ears open.

121
00:04:31,712 --> 00:04:32,712
What, man?

122
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,746
Guardo's girlfriend...

123
00:04:34,747 --> 00:04:36,087
She could've figured out we used her

124
00:04:36,088 --> 00:04:37,754
to get him, told his people...

125
00:04:38,337 --> 00:04:39,900
Maybe the salvadorans are after us.

126
00:04:39,901 --> 00:04:40,837
I don't think so, man.

127
00:04:40,838 --> 00:04:43,838
Shane got hit with a fist,
not a machete or a grenade.

128
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:45,399
Let's go.

129
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,622
RHD's pretty thorough.

130
00:04:48,838 --> 00:04:50,650
They give us a starting
place with the victims?

131
00:04:50,651 --> 00:04:51,527
Like she said.

132
00:04:51,528 --> 00:04:52,836
Released from a prison in Sinaloa.

133
00:04:52,837 --> 00:04:54,712
Connections to the same mexican cartel.

134
00:04:54,713 --> 00:04:56,268
All with guest worker visas.

135
00:04:56,836 --> 00:04:57,836
Let me see that.

136
00:04:58,652 --> 00:05:00,214
Prisoners don't get work visas.

137
00:05:00,215 --> 00:05:01,603
Especially not real ones.

138
00:05:01,778 --> 00:05:03,055
A- plus forgeries then.

139
00:05:04,403 --> 00:05:06,403
Where do you want me to start, jefe?

140
00:05:07,776 --> 00:05:08,901
It's either give you a hand

141
00:05:08,902 --> 00:05:10,624
or be out on the street, right?

142
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:13,526
I've still got some drag at I.N.S.

143
00:05:13,527 --> 00:05:16,193
so I'll get them to run
a quick I.D. on the arm.

144
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:19,088
But you know these streets
better than anyone.

145
00:05:19,089 --> 00:05:20,589
Where do you want to start?

146
00:05:20,777 --> 00:05:21,777
With the visas.

147
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:23,653
You know anyone that does
that quality of work?

148
00:05:23,654 --> 00:05:24,709
I might know a guy.

149
00:05:25,654 --> 00:05:27,431
By the way, welcome to the team.

150
00:05:29,341 --> 00:05:30,396
Won't let you down.

151
00:05:30,651 --> 00:05:32,762
He's the boss now.
Don't let him down.

152
00:05:33,091 --> 00:05:34,091
Let's go.

153
00:05:36,217 --> 00:05:39,216
Graciela sanchez is getting
out of mission cross today.

154
00:05:39,463 --> 00:05:41,154
How are we doing iding her rapist?

155
00:05:41,155 --> 00:05:43,775
Billings is pounding the pavement
with the sketch Princess gave us.

156
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:46,029
The feds are running
the profile I came up with

157
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,716
through their database
for potential unsubs.

158
00:05:47,717 --> 00:05:49,652
Contact the local y's, teen shelters...

159
00:05:49,653 --> 00:05:51,339
I did it, I did it. No one's
gotten back to me yet.

160
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,451
Stay on top of them.

161
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,335
Our guy's M.O.'s escalating.

162
00:05:54,904 --> 00:05:55,778
Wouldn't surprise me

163
00:05:55,779 --> 00:05:57,723
if he's already got a fresh victim.

164
00:06:05,093 --> 00:06:06,093
Oh, my god.

165
00:06:11,841 --> 00:06:12,896
What are you doing?

166
00:06:12,969 --> 00:06:14,279
Details of the crime scene,

167
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,840
create a written report
for the files on this case.

168
00:06:16,841 --> 00:06:18,354
Who wants what and why

169
00:06:18,552 --> 00:06:20,561
and how slaughtering
all those people in this room

170
00:06:20,868 --> 00:06:22,217
helped achieve that goal.

171
00:06:22,218 --> 00:06:24,341
That's all you need
to be writing down, man.

172
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,456
Hey, hey.
I don't want to be here.

173
00:06:25,457 --> 00:06:26,396
Too bad.

174
00:06:27,469 --> 00:06:28,466
12 people.

175
00:06:28,467 --> 00:06:29,161
3 of them women.

176
00:06:29,162 --> 00:06:31,467
Cut to pieces in this place 10 days ago.

177
00:06:31,468 --> 00:06:32,466
I read about it in the paper.

178
00:06:32,467 --> 00:06:33,800
I didn't need to see it.

179
00:06:35,907 --> 00:06:37,295
They were carrying these.

180
00:06:38,657 --> 00:06:40,277
Only one guy I know
good enough to produce

181
00:06:40,282 --> 00:06:41,594
this kind of work and that's you.

182
00:06:41,595 --> 00:06:42,595
I changed careers.

183
00:06:42,966 --> 00:06:44,132
If not you, then who?

184
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:45,655
I couldn't say.

185
00:06:46,845 --> 00:06:48,289
Paper men, we have a code.

186
00:06:48,412 --> 00:06:49,592
You got a code.

187
00:06:49,912 --> 00:06:51,716
You the blood on these walls? Huh?

188
00:06:51,717 --> 00:06:52,717
You see it?

189
00:06:53,466 --> 00:06:54,969
You have no idea the pressure to point

190
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,094
the finger at someone for this.

191
00:06:56,095 --> 00:06:57,706
No matter how bogus that I.D.

192
00:07:02,218 --> 00:07:03,218
Look again.

193
00:07:04,604 --> 00:07:06,783
I-I can tell you these
were done in mexico, not here.

194
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:07,906
Hiatt: How can you be so sure?

195
00:07:07,907 --> 00:07:10,715
The font. T-they use an older version.

196
00:07:10,716 --> 00:07:12,656
It's almost the same, but not quite.

197
00:07:12,657 --> 00:07:14,768
Mexicans and the sals, troubled times.

198
00:07:14,784 --> 00:07:16,658
Latinos can't even trust
each other these days.

199
00:07:16,659 --> 00:07:17,659
Wait outside.

200
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,136
Brown and Brown, it's a place to start.

201
00:07:22,407 --> 00:07:24,795
Body count like this,
the aztecs and mayans

202
00:07:24,926 --> 00:07:27,908
are squabbling over more
than who invented the burrito.

203
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:29,909
So let's start with the salvadorans.

204
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,589
Thank you, sheriff.

205
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,156
Didn't expect to see
your grenade tossing ass

206
00:07:35,157 --> 00:07:36,823
for at least another 30 years.

207
00:07:37,058 --> 00:07:38,720
Tejado: Oh, it's your lucky day.

208
00:07:38,721 --> 00:07:40,609
Oh, Guardo's number 2 has arrived.

209
00:07:42,468 --> 00:07:45,245
Why are your old amigos
beefing with the mexicans?

210
00:07:45,785 --> 00:07:48,982
Day trip for me,
but you wasted your time.

211
00:07:49,222 --> 00:07:50,277
Get your feet down!

212
00:07:51,845 --> 00:07:53,289
I'm just enjoying the air.

213
00:07:55,597 --> 00:07:58,152
What's it gonna take
to make it worth my time?

214
00:07:58,533 --> 00:08:01,032
Look, I want to know if Guardo
or any other salvadorans

215
00:08:01,033 --> 00:08:02,977
were behind the San Marcos murders.

216
00:08:03,035 --> 00:08:04,146
You get one request.

217
00:08:04,223 --> 00:08:06,783
I deny it, that's it,
you're back in your hole.

218
00:08:06,784 --> 00:08:08,728
But if it's something reasonable...

219
00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:11,607
I want my dick sucked by a hottie.

220
00:08:11,672 --> 00:08:13,242
Right here on the table.

221
00:08:15,035 --> 00:08:17,161
Thought it was gonna
be something difficult.

222
00:08:17,162 --> 00:08:20,358
Alright. Info first, dick suckin' next.

223
00:08:21,641 --> 00:08:23,864
OK. They killed Guardo.

224
00:08:24,222 --> 00:08:25,222
The mexicans.

225
00:08:25,787 --> 00:08:26,385
When?

226
00:08:26,386 --> 00:08:28,687
He came back to LA a week ago.

227
00:08:28,723 --> 00:08:30,167
Bam bam.
Just disappeared.

228
00:08:30,537 --> 00:08:31,785
Explains why we can't find him.

229
00:08:31,786 --> 00:08:33,036
Guardo works for the cartel.

230
00:08:33,037 --> 00:08:34,037
Why the bad blood?

231
00:08:35,493 --> 00:08:36,396
Yo no se.

232
00:08:37,137 --> 00:08:39,143
Hey, that dick ain't gonna suck itself.

233
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:40,426
That's the straight-up truth.

234
00:08:40,427 --> 00:08:42,033
Beaners the ones started this beef.

235
00:08:42,034 --> 00:08:44,077
Salvas gonna finish it.

236
00:08:44,474 --> 00:08:47,551
So, Guardo's MIA, presumably dead,
you're wearing orange.

237
00:08:47,552 --> 00:08:48,799
Who's gonna take up the fight?

238
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,535
It's been worked out
in upper management.

239
00:08:50,536 --> 00:08:51,472
Octavio...

240
00:08:51,473 --> 00:08:52,412
Rodrigo...

241
00:08:52,413 --> 00:08:53,413
Hernan...

242
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:55,685
I know the first two. Who's this hernan?

243
00:08:55,686 --> 00:08:57,662
New guy. Wants to be the shot caller.

244
00:08:57,663 --> 00:08:58,599
If he's such a player,

245
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,223
how come he's a mystery man to me?

246
00:09:00,224 --> 00:09:01,557
Just here from Salvador.

247
00:09:05,098 --> 00:09:06,098
Yeah?

248
00:09:07,289 --> 00:09:08,289
Where?

249
00:09:11,314 --> 00:09:13,627
Hey! What about my hummer?

250
00:09:15,974 --> 00:09:16,974
Asher.

251
00:09:16,975 --> 00:09:18,225
Come here.

252
00:09:18,823 --> 00:09:21,035
You're considered a hottie
in certain circles, right?

253
00:09:21,036 --> 00:09:22,091
Damn straight. Why?

254
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:23,666
This is Tejado.

255
00:09:23,667 --> 00:09:25,475
He's got a special request for you.

256
00:09:25,476 --> 00:09:27,174
Yeah?
What's that?

257
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:32,205
Yeah, that was Moses.

258
00:09:32,225 --> 00:09:33,120
The one-niner ball?

259
00:09:33,121 --> 00:09:34,973
Yeah, he's got some intel on Shane.

260
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:37,307
I know this is
the first priority, though.

261
00:09:38,726 --> 00:09:40,163
Wyms wants you on a short leash.

262
00:09:40,164 --> 00:09:42,997
So don't go walking into traffic,
make me look bad.

263
00:09:45,224 --> 00:09:47,224
Your friend Graciela's been
released from the hospital.

264
00:09:47,225 --> 00:09:48,502
You know she was raped.

265
00:09:48,661 --> 00:09:49,661
Who's Graciela?

266
00:09:49,913 --> 00:09:53,537
According to the girls at
the Rec Center, you 2 are pretty tight.

267
00:09:53,538 --> 00:09:55,315
How long you been on the street?

268
00:09:56,103 --> 00:09:58,825
By law we're required to
send runaways back home.

269
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:02,887
But if you cooperate, tell us
everything you know about Graciela...

270
00:10:02,982 --> 00:10:05,910
And promise to go back home on your own,

271
00:10:07,535 --> 00:10:09,090
We'll take you at your word.

272
00:10:12,161 --> 00:10:13,605
I haven't seen her lately.

273
00:10:13,659 --> 00:10:15,347
Any strange men ever
followed her around?

274
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:16,909
Acting suspicious toward her?

275
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:19,594
There's this one guy at
Ray's who was creeping us out.

276
00:10:19,595 --> 00:10:21,095
The burger stand on Wilcox?

277
00:10:21,282 --> 00:10:22,282
J.B.

278
00:10:22,595 --> 00:10:24,612
We'd smile, he'd give us
free burgers and shit.

279
00:10:24,613 --> 00:10:26,366
Ever feel sick after J.B. feeds you?

280
00:10:26,785 --> 00:10:28,656
No. Why?

281
00:10:29,596 --> 00:10:31,157
According to the girls
you were quite friendly.

282
00:10:31,158 --> 00:10:32,380
Giving them free food.

283
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:33,734
They're lying. I never did that.

284
00:10:33,735 --> 00:10:36,219
'cause if you stole from your employer,
that's a parole violation.

285
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,053
You homesick for the joint, J.B.?

286
00:10:38,411 --> 00:10:40,471
Look, maybe I talked
to them once or twice.

287
00:10:40,472 --> 00:10:42,038
Gave 'em leftovers. So?

288
00:10:42,287 --> 00:10:43,407
Talking to them's one thing.

289
00:10:43,408 --> 00:10:44,963
Spiking their soda with GHB,

290
00:10:45,097 --> 00:10:47,160
sodomizing and
torturing them's another.

291
00:10:47,161 --> 00:10:48,383
I didn't do that shit.

292
00:10:48,635 --> 00:10:51,471
It's gotta be tough to
meet a nice girl your age.

293
00:10:51,472 --> 00:10:53,584
Ex-con,
pulling minimum wage.

294
00:10:53,909 --> 00:10:56,675
But a homeless,
hungry 15-year-old runaway,

295
00:10:57,162 --> 00:10:59,384
Easy to impress with a burger and fries.

296
00:11:07,014 --> 00:11:08,532
Hey, hey,
it's cool, it's cool.

297
00:11:10,158 --> 00:11:11,788
You better pray you
didn't hurt that foot

298
00:11:11,789 --> 00:11:13,313
sticking it up a white cop's ass.

299
00:11:13,314 --> 00:11:14,599
Easy, dude.

300
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,536
I'm rocking a pimp stick
'cause I'm cold like that.

301
00:11:16,537 --> 00:11:18,161
You got something to say about Shane?

302
00:11:18,162 --> 00:11:19,162
Start talking.

303
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:20,465
You remember Tilli?

304
00:11:21,164 --> 00:11:23,552
That chick I was with
the last time we met.

305
00:11:23,728 --> 00:11:25,282
What, that 12-year-old you're sticking?

306
00:11:25,283 --> 00:11:27,347
She's 18 and old enough for your boy

307
00:11:27,348 --> 00:11:29,287
to be tapping that ass behind my back.

308
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:31,163
You expect us to believe
Shane is banging that chick?

309
00:11:31,164 --> 00:11:32,162
That's what I said.

310
00:11:32,163 --> 00:11:33,922
Only reason I brought
y'all down is because

311
00:11:33,923 --> 00:11:35,723
y'all gonna have reason
to think I beat him down.

312
00:11:35,724 --> 00:11:38,779
Riding up in your girl's steeze
works as motive for me.

313
00:11:38,914 --> 00:11:40,162
I ain't hit that shit in a minute.

314
00:11:40,163 --> 00:11:42,163
And I ain't about no sloppy seconds.

315
00:11:42,288 --> 00:11:44,510
Word, I did not take flight on your boy.

316
00:11:44,725 --> 00:11:46,113
Not that I would a minded.

317
00:11:46,165 --> 00:11:47,165
Then who did?

318
00:11:47,852 --> 00:11:48,852
Ask the l'il ho.

319
00:11:49,289 --> 00:11:50,589
Seem like she all about telling

320
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,559
the white man what he wanna hear.

321
00:11:54,975 --> 00:11:56,586
Hey, I'm Detective Wagenbach.

322
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,539
Carlos Morganza.
Children's beacon.

323
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,787
The runaway shelter on Western.

324
00:11:59,788 --> 00:12:01,037
You sent out an alert to us?

325
00:12:01,038 --> 00:12:01,911
Thanks for coming in.

326
00:12:01,912 --> 00:12:03,914
You're actually the first
person to get back to me.

327
00:12:03,915 --> 00:12:05,976
Well, when I heard
what happened to those girls,

328
00:12:05,977 --> 00:12:08,726
I put together a list of the kids
I thought were most at risk.

329
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:10,393
You know, drugs, prostitution.

330
00:12:10,475 --> 00:12:12,789
Is there any way we can confirm
which of these kids have been seen

331
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,663
and which haven't
in the last 24 hours?

332
00:12:14,664 --> 00:12:15,719
I'll do what I can.

333
00:12:16,789 --> 00:12:17,955
Thanks for coming in.

334
00:12:18,164 --> 00:12:22,224
Oh, um, my daughter
sabrina went missing.

335
00:12:22,351 --> 00:12:24,104
It's been 3 years now.

336
00:12:24,351 --> 00:12:28,116
Her case got cold,
the police had other priorities.

337
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,678
If you could take a look.

338
00:12:31,977 --> 00:12:33,754
When I get a chance, absolutely.

339
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:35,519
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

340
00:12:38,228 --> 00:12:39,228
Just take it easy.

341
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:41,882
A little slower.

342
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,727
Hey.

343
00:12:45,728 --> 00:12:46,728
Sorry.

344
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:52,177
Jesus. We're gonna find out
who did this.

345
00:12:52,852 --> 00:12:53,852
How ya doing?

346
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,924
You just saw the only part
of him that's not bruised.

347
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:00,917
The Captain sent me over
here to take a statement.

348
00:13:00,918 --> 00:13:02,728
I already told Vic
everything that happened.

349
00:13:02,729 --> 00:13:04,541
Yeah. Well, I also have
orders to park myself

350
00:13:04,542 --> 00:13:06,102
out here as your protective detail.

351
00:13:06,103 --> 00:13:08,852
I'll be fine. I was just in
the wrong place at the wrong time.

352
00:13:08,853 --> 00:13:10,853
I got orders.
I'll be right outside.

353
00:13:11,668 --> 00:13:12,668
Thanks.

354
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:15,916
You got it? OK.

355
00:13:21,977 --> 00:13:24,865
Feds faxed over some suspects
that fit your profile.

356
00:13:25,354 --> 00:13:26,853
Anything turn up at J.B.'s place?

357
00:13:26,854 --> 00:13:28,728
No signs he placed prison runaways.

358
00:13:28,729 --> 00:13:29,976
It's a fourth floor walk-up.

359
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:31,980
He'd have to take his victims
up 4 flights of stairs.

360
00:13:31,981 --> 00:13:32,981
Paper thin walls.

361
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:35,855
Hard to believe he could do
that without somebody noticing.

362
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:36,856
Good luck.

363
00:13:37,689 --> 00:13:38,972
Detective Wagenbach.

364
00:13:39,623 --> 00:13:42,169
Carlos. Detective Billings,
Carlos Morganza.

365
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,979
He's a counselor
at the children's beacon.

366
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,757
I got involved about 3 years ago

367
00:13:45,793 --> 00:13:47,191
when my own daughter went missing.

368
00:13:47,192 --> 00:13:48,166
I'm sorry to hear that.

369
00:13:48,167 --> 00:13:49,728
Listen, my colleagues and I checked

370
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:52,043
into that list of high-risk
kids like you asked.

371
00:13:52,044 --> 00:13:53,293
These are the names of the ones

372
00:13:53,294 --> 00:13:54,729
we've lost touch with most recently.

373
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:56,118
This is great. Thank you.

374
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,723
Sure. Listen, I can run
through them with you.

375
00:13:58,856 --> 00:14:00,544
You know what?
I'm in the weeds right now,

376
00:14:00,545 --> 00:14:03,933
but if you can sit at my desk,
I can get a uni to take notes.

377
00:14:04,042 --> 00:14:05,214
Oh. Sure.

378
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:06,611
Thank you.

379
00:14:09,692 --> 00:14:10,759
Dutchman.

380
00:14:10,957 --> 00:14:13,019
Remind me again your
profile of our bad guy.

381
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,708
Why, so you can shit all over it?

382
00:14:14,709 --> 00:14:15,709
No, I'm serious.

383
00:14:17,662 --> 00:14:19,650
Uh, he's a single father,

384
00:14:19,772 --> 00:14:22,085
whose daughter disappeared
or died prematurely.

385
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:26,148
What kind a douche bag breaks his ass
for no reason trying to help the cops?

386
00:14:26,149 --> 00:14:27,315
He's got a missing...

387
00:14:28,524 --> 00:14:29,959
Right? A lot of these freaks

388
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,515
like to insert themselves
into investigations.

389
00:14:37,901 --> 00:14:39,585
Uh, you know what, Carlos,

390
00:14:39,586 --> 00:14:41,919
I think I can make time
for you right now.

391
00:14:42,022 --> 00:14:44,494
Claudette Wyms.
This is Cruz Pezula.

392
00:14:45,086 --> 00:14:47,460
I wanted to introduce Cruz
to the new Captain.

393
00:14:47,461 --> 00:14:50,016
More like the fresh meat
in Farmington. Hello.

394
00:14:50,086 --> 00:14:51,086
It's a pleasure.

395
00:14:51,087 --> 00:14:53,587
What's the latest on
the San Marcos massacre?

396
00:14:54,451 --> 00:14:55,427
I'm sorry.

397
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:57,397
Are you with the police
committee as well?

398
00:14:57,398 --> 00:14:58,398
No, I'm not.

399
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,939
I can vouch for Cruz.
He's well respected in the community.

400
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,708
In fact, he's the one who
passed on that information

401
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:04,986
about the possible
salvadoran connection.

402
00:15:05,148 --> 00:15:07,398
I know a lot of people
who are devastated

403
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:09,450
by this new level of violence.

404
00:15:09,523 --> 00:15:10,523
As are we all.

405
00:15:10,585 --> 00:15:12,211
Claudette has
the committee's full support.

406
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:13,462
How many Detectives you got on it?

407
00:15:13,463 --> 00:15:14,772
It's the entire Strike Team.

408
00:15:14,773 --> 00:15:15,510
Mackey, too?

409
00:15:15,511 --> 00:15:17,211
Kevin Hiatt's taking point.

410
00:15:17,212 --> 00:15:18,900
He was with INS 4 years.

411
00:15:18,901 --> 00:15:20,587
The victims are all mexican nationals...

412
00:15:20,588 --> 00:15:21,976
He's more than qualified.

413
00:15:22,024 --> 00:15:23,024
I should hope so.

414
00:15:24,837 --> 00:15:26,147
Could you give us a minute?

415
00:15:26,148 --> 00:15:27,148
Of course.

416
00:15:33,461 --> 00:15:35,516
Don't ever ambush me like that again.

417
00:15:35,588 --> 00:15:37,254
He has concerns. I share them.

418
00:15:37,465 --> 00:15:40,588
I don't care how plugged in to
your constituency that guy is.

419
00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:43,533
Bringing a civilian into
a confidential police matter

420
00:15:43,588 --> 00:15:46,641
undermines the investigation
and my authority.

421
00:15:48,091 --> 00:15:49,313
I meant no disrespect.

422
00:15:49,962 --> 00:15:51,214
But perhaps you wouldn't be taking it

423
00:15:51,215 --> 00:15:53,715
so personally if you had
more facts to share.

424
00:15:54,277 --> 00:15:55,087
I'm sorry, Captain.

425
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:56,590
I didn't know you were in here.

426
00:15:56,591 --> 00:15:59,924
Would it be OK if we used this room
to talk to Mr. Morganza?

427
00:16:00,467 --> 00:16:03,522
No. I'm in the middle of something
with the councilman.

428
00:16:04,092 --> 00:16:05,425
I'm sorry to bother you.

429
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,977
Would it be all right if
we talked in interrogation?

430
00:16:07,978 --> 00:16:09,653
It's a little less personal. Sorry.

431
00:16:09,654 --> 00:16:11,154
- Sure. Yeah. No problem.
- OK.

432
00:16:13,814 --> 00:16:15,676
Hey, Tilli!

433
00:16:16,345 --> 00:16:17,393
Get over here!

434
00:16:18,414 --> 00:16:21,089
Yo, why you calling me out
in front of my peoples?

435
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,090
I'm a cop.

436
00:16:22,966 --> 00:16:24,132
I hear you like cops.

437
00:16:24,757 --> 00:16:26,653
That some sort of code or something?

438
00:16:26,654 --> 00:16:28,154
I know about you and Shane.

439
00:16:28,468 --> 00:16:29,634
He's in the hospital.

440
00:16:30,029 --> 00:16:31,816
- What for?
- Somebody jumped him.

441
00:16:31,817 --> 00:16:33,289
I figured you could tell us who.

442
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:34,845
Wait. He caught a smackdown?

443
00:16:34,965 --> 00:16:36,909
Is he a'ight?
I want to go see him.

444
00:16:36,975 --> 00:16:37,774
Which hospital?

445
00:16:37,775 --> 00:16:39,211
His wife's with him right now.

446
00:16:39,212 --> 00:16:40,434
I'll say I'm a friend.

447
00:16:40,435 --> 00:16:43,553
Shane doesn't have
too many teenage black friends.

448
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,265
How'd you get this?

449
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:47,213
My stepdad.

450
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:51,330
Your stepdad know you're
spreading your legs for Shane?

451
00:16:52,148 --> 00:16:53,259
He got pretty angry.

452
00:16:53,464 --> 00:16:55,352
I told him it wasn't his business.

453
00:16:55,401 --> 00:16:56,462
And if he tried to stop it,

454
00:16:56,463 --> 00:16:59,179
or put his hands on me again,
Shane would kick his ass.

455
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,129
Where's he at now?

456
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:01,087
Hell if I know.

457
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:01,990
Where's he work?

458
00:17:01,991 --> 00:17:02,991
He don't.

459
00:17:03,302 --> 00:17:05,746
He about that monthly
check from the county.

460
00:17:06,346 --> 00:17:07,990
Look, if he did that to Shane,

461
00:17:07,991 --> 00:17:10,427
what do you think he's gonna do
to me the next time I see him?

462
00:17:10,428 --> 00:17:12,863
You stay away from the hospital
and stay away from your old man.

463
00:17:12,864 --> 00:17:14,086
I'll take care of him.

464
00:17:16,441 --> 00:17:19,699
Corrine, that percocet's not working.

465
00:17:20,242 --> 00:17:21,868
I'll ask the resident
for something stronger.

466
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:22,518
Thanks.

467
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:24,198
Listen, before I forget,

468
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:25,492
these are his personal items,

469
00:17:25,493 --> 00:17:26,881
including his car keys...

470
00:17:26,882 --> 00:17:28,837
One of the unis removed
the bullets from his gun.

471
00:17:28,838 --> 00:17:30,742
Those things scare the hell out of me.

472
00:17:30,743 --> 00:17:31,743
Thanks.

473
00:17:34,006 --> 00:17:36,010
Can you give us a minute, please?

474
00:17:36,157 --> 00:17:37,657
Sure.
Thanks.

475
00:17:38,677 --> 00:17:40,232
God damn you!
How could you?

476
00:17:40,303 --> 00:17:42,678
Shit! Jesus! What?

477
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:43,956
Why do you need condoms

478
00:17:43,957 --> 00:17:45,803
when I'm 3 months pregnant?

479
00:17:47,004 --> 00:17:49,050
They must have been from before.

480
00:17:50,148 --> 00:17:51,885
Mara, I'm not doing anything, baby.

481
00:17:51,886 --> 00:17:52,861
I swear.

482
00:17:52,862 --> 00:17:55,246
Son of a bitch.
Yes, you are!

483
00:17:57,475 --> 00:17:58,539
Does it have anything to do

484
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,914
with the reason why you're here?

485
00:17:59,915 --> 00:18:00,915
Does it?

486
00:18:03,151 --> 00:18:04,252
Oh, no.

487
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:07,058
Mara, it's nothing.

488
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:08,314
It's nothing.

489
00:18:08,315 --> 00:18:09,370
It's not important.

490
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,126
Look, I'm...

491
00:18:13,252 --> 00:18:16,070
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

492
00:18:16,565 --> 00:18:17,660
I've just... I've been all twisted up.

493
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:19,323
I'm, I'm. You?

494
00:18:19,752 --> 00:18:22,142
This is us, OK? Our family.

495
00:18:22,339 --> 00:18:23,339
You threw it away.

496
00:18:24,635 --> 00:18:25,635
And for what?

497
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:28,654
I've been trying to help
you through all of this,

498
00:18:28,655 --> 00:18:32,316
you waking up screaming,
and then you're out...

499
00:18:32,605 --> 00:18:34,487
Oh, I can't believe you!

500
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:36,967
Jesus!

501
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:43,049
This is for the pain.

502
00:18:53,571 --> 00:18:54,946
When sabrina first went missing,

503
00:18:54,947 --> 00:18:56,567
everyone pitched in to help find her.

504
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:58,501
Friends, neighbors, my church.

505
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:01,989
<i>But after a while, people go
back to their routines.</i>

506
00:19:02,257 --> 00:19:03,257
Life goes on.

507
00:19:04,007 --> 00:19:06,530
Even the police move on
to other business.

508
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:08,389
But she's still out there.

509
00:19:09,821 --> 00:19:11,265
We appreciate you helping.

510
00:19:11,697 --> 00:19:14,821
All I can say is, as a parent myself,
it's gotta be awful.

511
00:19:14,822 --> 00:19:16,131
Your heart breaks all over again

512
00:19:16,132 --> 00:19:18,020
every day you don't hear from her.

513
00:19:18,945 --> 00:19:21,233
<i>There are 15 kids on your list.</i>

514
00:19:21,234 --> 00:19:22,570
<i>Is there any one you feel</i>

515
00:19:22,571 --> 00:19:24,682
is a particular risk to this predator?

516
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:29,109
Oh, probably...

517
00:19:31,901 --> 00:19:32,901
Rosanna.

518
00:19:33,901 --> 00:19:35,647
She had a pimp. Had his claws in her.

519
00:19:35,648 --> 00:19:36,586
Once that happens,

520
00:19:36,587 --> 00:19:38,531
it sets up a whole victim mentality

521
00:19:38,532 --> 00:19:40,316
and that's an open invitation.

522
00:19:40,339 --> 00:19:42,335
When was the last time anyone saw her?

523
00:19:42,336 --> 00:19:43,397
2, 3 weeks ago.

524
00:19:44,899 --> 00:19:45,713
Dutch?

525
00:19:45,714 --> 00:19:46,587
Kevin Hiatt.

526
00:19:46,588 --> 00:19:47,337
New here.

527
00:19:47,338 --> 00:19:48,560
Yeah, I know. Welcome.

528
00:19:48,712 --> 00:19:49,823
Thanks. Hey, listen.

529
00:19:49,837 --> 00:19:52,213
We're running with
the San Marcos house murders.

530
00:19:52,214 --> 00:19:54,338
I was just wondering if you
had any files I should see?

531
00:19:54,339 --> 00:19:56,710
Uh, yeah. Give me a few minutes,
I'll get them together.

532
00:19:56,711 --> 00:19:57,774
Sure. Cool. Hey, listen.

533
00:19:57,775 --> 00:20:00,108
What do you know about
a guy named Hernan?

534
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,860
Um... Come here.

535
00:20:05,589 --> 00:20:06,589
He's a Fed'.

536
00:20:07,027 --> 00:20:09,638
He's undercover in the
salvadoran organization.

537
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:12,905
So, how do I get in touch with him?

538
00:20:14,086 --> 00:20:15,086
You don't.

539
00:20:15,651 --> 00:20:16,651
I tried.

540
00:20:17,775 --> 00:20:20,151
Female fed showed up
on my door at midnight

541
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:21,461
saying she's Hernan's handler

542
00:20:21,462 --> 00:20:22,850
and to back the hell off.

543
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,150
What agency?

544
00:20:24,529 --> 00:20:25,529
I.C.E.

545
00:20:25,776 --> 00:20:27,164
So don't waste your time.

546
00:20:28,588 --> 00:20:30,532
Well, it's my time to waste, right?

547
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:32,407
What's his handler's name?

548
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,590
Vic Mackey!

549
00:20:36,713 --> 00:20:37,713
Jesus Christ.

550
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:40,394
The ghost of christmas past!

551
00:20:41,404 --> 00:20:42,402
You're looking good, man.

552
00:20:42,403 --> 00:20:43,400
For an old guy.

553
00:20:43,401 --> 00:20:46,012
I see them baldness cures
still ain't for shit.

554
00:20:46,091 --> 00:20:47,091
Oh, watch it.

555
00:20:47,965 --> 00:20:50,088
Hey, I heard about your guy.

556
00:20:50,089 --> 00:20:51,311
Curtis was a good kid.

557
00:20:51,488 --> 00:20:53,900
Well, none of us get outta this
place in one piece, right?

558
00:20:53,901 --> 00:20:55,734
Yeah. I was away for the funeral.

559
00:20:55,778 --> 00:20:57,403
Is there some sort of a charity

560
00:20:57,404 --> 00:20:59,459
or police memorial fund or something?

561
00:20:59,527 --> 00:21:00,949
Audubon society.

562
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:03,400
Lem was really into birds, turns out.

563
00:21:03,401 --> 00:21:04,341
OK.

564
00:21:04,342 --> 00:21:06,094
Things really turned
around for you, looks like.

565
00:21:06,095 --> 00:21:08,527
Yeah. You know, I got
my feet underneath me.

566
00:21:08,528 --> 00:21:10,695
Doing pretty good. It took a minute,
but I'm doing pretty good.

567
00:21:10,696 --> 00:21:13,229
Look, I got a business
proposition for you.

568
00:21:13,591 --> 00:21:14,813
Look, rain check, man.

569
00:21:15,086 --> 00:21:17,652
I got 12 D.B.'s, no suspect.

570
00:21:17,653 --> 00:21:18,715
My partner took a beating.

571
00:21:18,716 --> 00:21:20,155
Not only am I flying solo,

572
00:21:20,156 --> 00:21:22,767
I gotta locate who did it
and return the favor.

573
00:21:22,841 --> 00:21:25,327
Come on, Vic. You helped me
through a rough patch, man.

574
00:21:25,328 --> 00:21:28,041
I'm just trying to, you know,
pay back the kindness.

575
00:21:28,966 --> 00:21:31,077
Come on, come on.
Take a ride with me.

576
00:21:31,078 --> 00:21:32,308
I'll have you back in 30.

577
00:21:32,687 --> 00:21:33,652
You're living large,

578
00:21:33,653 --> 00:21:36,541
driving around in a high-end
pussy magnet like this.

579
00:21:37,716 --> 00:21:41,049
Only now I got a 26-year-old filipina
I gotta keep in Gucci.

580
00:21:43,404 --> 00:21:45,626
The buzz is you're getting squeezed out.

581
00:21:46,156 --> 00:21:47,216
Maybe without a pension.

582
00:21:47,217 --> 00:21:48,828
I'm not getting squeezed out.

583
00:21:49,155 --> 00:21:51,652
And nobody's got their hand
in my pocket either.

584
00:21:51,653 --> 00:21:52,653
What's the job?

585
00:21:52,717 --> 00:21:54,966
Citizen, east LA., he owns
an apartment building.

586
00:21:54,967 --> 00:21:57,300
Wants to spruce it up
and raise the rents.

587
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,835
Only there's this undesirable
element camped out there.

588
00:22:01,032 --> 00:22:03,586
So the landlord wants
to hire a cleaning crew.

589
00:22:04,469 --> 00:22:08,469
Jamaican dope operation's got the run
of the place, terrorizing Lieutenants.

590
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:12,473
Can't evict 'em, long
as the rent's on time.

591
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:15,279
Need a little hand persuading
them to move elsewhere, man.

592
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,113
My plate's pretty full right now.

593
00:22:18,217 --> 00:22:20,219
Vic, there's families
living in this place.

594
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,655
There's little kids riding their bikes

595
00:22:21,656 --> 00:22:22,779
next to these dope deals going down.

596
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:25,280
The landlord's paying
good money, too, right?

597
00:22:27,781 --> 00:22:29,802
Cash. All right? Half up front.

598
00:22:31,657 --> 00:22:33,272
Look, man, just scope it out.

599
00:22:33,282 --> 00:22:34,266
If it looks good to you,

600
00:22:34,267 --> 00:22:37,533
having a real badge around'll
make this thing go a lot smoother.

601
00:22:37,534 --> 00:22:40,159
Besides, I can't do it without you.

602
00:22:43,615 --> 00:22:44,615
Let's look.

603
00:22:45,927 --> 00:22:47,204
Yeah. Come on! Come on!

604
00:22:48,364 --> 00:22:49,364
Spotter.

605
00:22:50,179 --> 00:22:51,512
Embedded with innocents.

606
00:22:52,992 --> 00:22:55,603
Glad I was wrong about
your getting shoved out.

607
00:22:56,242 --> 00:22:57,363
It's a shitty way to go.

608
00:22:57,364 --> 00:22:59,308
Everybody knows you got a raw deal.

609
00:23:00,806 --> 00:23:02,472
It was goddamned embarrassing.

610
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:04,427
I mean, you shit blood for 'em,

611
00:23:04,428 --> 00:23:06,983
then you don't get to
leave on your own terms.

612
00:23:08,243 --> 00:23:10,409
Hope you never have
to go through that.

613
00:23:10,869 --> 00:23:11,869
Yeah.

614
00:23:13,741 --> 00:23:14,741
There's security.

615
00:23:14,742 --> 00:23:17,181
Yeah, and probably 2 more upstairs.

616
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:19,295
Cashier guy, one at the door.

617
00:23:21,057 --> 00:23:22,741
I'm gonna take a pass on this, Joe,

618
00:23:22,742 --> 00:23:25,742
and whether you realize it or
not, you should do the same.

619
00:23:25,743 --> 00:23:26,909
You don't understand.

620
00:23:27,243 --> 00:23:29,520
Vic, this is my only
paycheck this month.

621
00:23:32,368 --> 00:23:34,034
I really gotta get going back.

622
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:40,055
Can you at least run
priors on this place,

623
00:23:40,056 --> 00:23:42,944
let me see what level asswipe
I'm dealing with here?

624
00:23:44,431 --> 00:23:45,431
Yeah, sure.

625
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:48,993
<i>It's Rosanna.</i>

626
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:51,613
She had a pimp. Had his claws in her.

627
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:54,447
Once that happens, it sets
up a whole victim mentality,

628
00:23:54,448 --> 00:23:56,183
and that's
an open invitation.

629
00:23:56,683 --> 00:23:57,683
Is that him, baby?

630
00:23:58,432 --> 00:23:59,876
I'm sure that's his voice.

631
00:24:00,434 --> 00:24:01,434
You're positive?

632
00:24:01,743 --> 00:24:02,930
I was pretty out of it,

633
00:24:02,931 --> 00:24:06,558
but if there's a voice
I'll never forget, it's his.

634
00:24:11,557 --> 00:24:12,834
Entrance off the alley.

635
00:24:14,183 --> 00:24:15,183
Yeah, he pulls up,

636
00:24:15,369 --> 00:24:17,307
takes the victims inside
without anyone seeing.

637
00:24:17,308 --> 00:24:18,308
Yep.

638
00:24:31,306 --> 00:24:34,433
Hope your profile didn't say
anything about him being a neat freak.

639
00:24:34,434 --> 00:24:36,181
You wouldn't want a
cleaning lady coming around

640
00:24:36,182 --> 00:24:38,182
if you were holding
a girl prisoner.

641
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,560
Dutch.

642
00:24:46,059 --> 00:24:47,059
Rosanna?

643
00:24:52,621 --> 00:24:53,621
Sabrina's room.

644
00:24:55,371 --> 00:24:57,204
Concert poster Princess rembered.

645
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:59,121
What 15-year-old keeps
her room this neat?

646
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:00,935
The mess in the rest of
the house, he's letting go,

647
00:25:00,936 --> 00:25:04,498
falling apart, in here,
he's preserving her memory,

648
00:25:04,499 --> 00:25:06,554
or an idealized version of it anyway.

649
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,671
God, and what a clean-up job.

650
00:25:09,996 --> 00:25:12,400
Shampoo, wax.

651
00:25:13,122 --> 00:25:15,122
I wouldn't count on any hair fibers.

652
00:25:16,498 --> 00:25:17,498
Yeah.

653
00:25:26,059 --> 00:25:27,114
We talked to Tilli.

654
00:25:33,121 --> 00:25:34,843
Her old man got the drop on me.

655
00:25:37,309 --> 00:25:39,122
It's nothing.
It's just a thing...

656
00:25:39,123 --> 00:25:41,185
- Jesus Christ, Shane.
- Like no one in this car's

657
00:25:41,186 --> 00:25:43,228
ever had a little outta
bounds ass before.

658
00:25:43,229 --> 00:25:45,310
This is an 18-year-old girl,

659
00:25:45,311 --> 00:25:47,309
who's bedded down with
the head of the one-niners.

660
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:49,787
She's done with him.
Ask her.

661
00:25:49,998 --> 00:25:52,664
You saying this is about
more than getting laid?

662
00:25:53,249 --> 00:25:54,582
Look, everything's cool.

663
00:25:54,583 --> 00:25:56,224
She just shot off
her mouth about us

664
00:25:56,225 --> 00:25:59,359
to the dickhead stepdad
and I got blindsided.

665
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,526
Yeah, I can see that.

666
00:26:00,861 --> 00:26:03,049
Might wanna raise the
mistress bar a little bit.

667
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:05,772
If you still want a wife
and kid to come home to.

668
00:26:09,487 --> 00:26:11,653
You ever think
about just coming clean?

669
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:14,738
About everything?

670
00:26:17,487 --> 00:26:18,487
No.

671
00:26:21,864 --> 00:26:22,864
Yeah, I know.

672
00:26:25,174 --> 00:26:27,229
I guess we just have to live with it.

673
00:26:36,236 --> 00:26:38,847
All right.
It's dealer's choice on the stepdad.

674
00:26:38,924 --> 00:26:40,860
Either Ronnie and I can
take care of him tonight,

675
00:26:40,861 --> 00:26:42,799
or wait until you're
strong enough to join in.

676
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,800
No.

677
00:26:44,049 --> 00:26:45,104
No, just let it go.

678
00:26:45,239 --> 00:26:47,049
This guy knowingly laid hands on a cop.

679
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:48,989
This isn't just about your bruised ego.

680
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:50,101
There's a principle.

681
00:26:50,612 --> 00:26:53,167
Look, I don't want you
to do anything, please?

682
00:26:54,365 --> 00:26:55,809
I got enough to deal with.

683
00:27:10,308 --> 00:27:11,308
Mara?

684
00:27:13,372 --> 00:27:14,372
Mara?

685
00:27:17,712 --> 00:27:18,724
Mara.

686
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:23,809
Mara?

687
00:27:27,438 --> 00:27:28,607
Mara, come on.

688
00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:31,225
Look, this is stupid.

689
00:27:33,938 --> 00:27:36,107
Mara, please,
just open the door.

690
00:27:40,688 --> 00:27:42,799
Some black bitch called on your phone.

691
00:27:43,437 --> 00:27:45,060
She wanted to know if you were OK.

692
00:27:45,061 --> 00:27:46,616
She sounded like she was 10.

693
00:27:48,813 --> 00:27:51,924
Is that who you're banging
while I got morning sickness?

694
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,744
- Mara.
- Just...

695
00:27:57,373 --> 00:27:58,683
You've always been an asshole.

696
00:27:58,684 --> 00:28:00,120
Mara, please, I just...

697
00:28:00,121 --> 00:28:02,454
Yeah, I know, you're
all torn up over Lem.

698
00:28:05,497 --> 00:28:06,497
Get out.

699
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:10,922
I don't want our son or the new one
growing up anywhere near you.

700
00:28:11,435 --> 00:28:12,723
Get out!

701
00:28:24,521 --> 00:28:25,533
OK.

702
00:28:27,436 --> 00:28:28,436
What's up?

703
00:28:28,437 --> 00:28:29,750
My guy at INS I.D.'d the arm

704
00:28:29,751 --> 00:28:30,936
from the San Marcos house.

705
00:28:30,937 --> 00:28:32,165
Eduardo Romero.

706
00:28:33,001 --> 00:28:34,251
That supposed to mean something?

707
00:28:34,252 --> 00:28:37,009
Romero's a mid-level bureaucrat
in the mexican government.

708
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:38,513
Presidential appointment.

709
00:28:40,191 --> 00:28:43,357
Traveling around with a bunch
of drug-connected convicts?

710
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,689
One of their own officials.

711
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:45,874
This guy should have
been the first one

712
00:28:45,875 --> 00:28:47,313
the mexican government would've I.D.'d.

713
00:28:47,314 --> 00:28:48,814
So why didn't they tell us?

714
00:28:50,877 --> 00:28:52,501
Could embarrass a lot of powerful people

715
00:28:52,502 --> 00:28:53,873
on both sides of the border.

716
00:28:53,874 --> 00:28:54,874
That's right.

717
00:28:56,065 --> 00:28:57,065
Huh.

718
00:28:57,516 --> 00:28:58,763
Stop! No notes.

719
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:01,689
This doesn't exist for
anybody but us right now.

720
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:03,125
The captain asked for an update.

721
00:29:03,126 --> 00:29:04,348
You heard what I said.

722
00:29:04,634 --> 00:29:06,297
- What am I supposed to do...
- Hey, no report.

723
00:29:06,877 --> 00:29:07,751
This is raw intel.

724
00:29:07,752 --> 00:29:09,437
We don't even know where it leads yet.

725
00:29:09,438 --> 00:29:11,750
The difference between
the units and the Strike Team

726
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:14,584
is you don't hand your
superior pieces of a puzzle,

727
00:29:14,768 --> 00:29:16,545
you hand them the whole picture.

728
00:29:26,063 --> 00:29:27,961
Sorry to keep you waiting so long.

729
00:29:27,962 --> 00:29:30,280
We talked to local pimps,

730
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:31,764
put unis out on the street

731
00:29:31,765 --> 00:29:33,954
trolling the places where
you said Rosanna works.

732
00:29:33,955 --> 00:29:37,392
In the meantime, are there any other
places you can think of we should look?

733
00:29:37,393 --> 00:29:38,393
Not really.

734
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:39,770
Think hard.

735
00:29:40,019 --> 00:29:41,574
Sometimes we can locate kids

736
00:29:41,575 --> 00:29:43,456
just from personal
information about them.

737
00:29:43,457 --> 00:29:46,694
Kinda movies they like, where they eat,
music they listen to.

738
00:29:46,695 --> 00:29:48,069
Yeah. I mean, you
show me a kid's room,

739
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:50,070
and I can tell you their life story.

740
00:29:52,785 --> 00:29:54,832
You searched my house, didn't you?

741
00:29:55,818 --> 00:29:56,984
Why would we do that?

742
00:29:57,569 --> 00:29:59,402
You looked in my daughter's room.

743
00:30:02,695 --> 00:30:04,361
You won't find anything there.

744
00:30:04,384 --> 00:30:05,130
We've got two witnesses

745
00:30:05,131 --> 00:30:06,567
that can I.D. you as the rapist.

746
00:30:06,568 --> 00:30:07,571
They recognize your voice

747
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:10,405
and they rember the poster
in your daughter's room.

748
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:14,681
My lawyer'll have me out of here
before your shift ends.

749
00:30:14,821 --> 00:30:16,432
I'll be home before you guys.

750
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:24,556
You want to find your daughter, right?

751
00:30:25,196 --> 00:30:26,196
Right?

752
00:30:27,195 --> 00:30:28,694
You tell us what we want to know,

753
00:30:28,695 --> 00:30:30,583
I will personally re-open her case

754
00:30:30,948 --> 00:30:32,948
and do everything I can to find her.

755
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,070
You want answers?

756
00:30:38,385 --> 00:30:40,107
All right. I'll give 'em to you

757
00:30:40,445 --> 00:30:42,500
but only in front of a news reporter.

758
00:30:43,071 --> 00:30:45,015
I want Sabrina's story aired on tv.

759
00:30:45,071 --> 00:30:47,293
I won't let you all bury her away again.

760
00:30:51,198 --> 00:30:53,134
Couple 211's, possession.

761
00:30:53,135 --> 00:30:54,697
One of 'em caught an "F" for ag assault.

762
00:30:54,698 --> 00:30:55,753
Mostly minor stuff.

763
00:30:55,947 --> 00:30:57,835
If you round up a few more guys...

764
00:30:59,758 --> 00:31:01,071
I'm sorry to leave you hanging.

765
00:31:01,072 --> 00:31:02,072
Oh, no worries.

766
00:31:02,199 --> 00:31:04,810
My buddy's waiting outside.
We can handle this.

767
00:31:06,572 --> 00:31:08,349
Lotta ghosts in this place, man.

768
00:31:09,011 --> 00:31:10,288
Every day is Halloween.

769
00:31:12,386 --> 00:31:13,386
I'll walk you out.

770
00:31:13,825 --> 00:31:14,825
Goddamn freeway.

771
00:31:15,385 --> 00:31:17,635
This city's turning into
a third world shitbag.

772
00:31:17,636 --> 00:31:19,136
This is Lester. Vic Mackey.

773
00:31:19,571 --> 00:31:20,848
Know you by reputation.

774
00:31:22,387 --> 00:31:24,386
I haven't been south of
pico or east of the 110

775
00:31:24,387 --> 00:31:25,698
since I turned the badge in.

776
00:31:25,699 --> 00:31:27,946
Yeah. Well, this'll be good
exercise for you then, huh?

777
00:31:27,947 --> 00:31:31,385
Maybe you should take a couple
more bodies with you on this one, Joe.

778
00:31:31,386 --> 00:31:34,009
Afro-humps'll be so stoned
they won't even know what hit them.

779
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:36,697
These guys seem like
they're on their game.

780
00:31:36,698 --> 00:31:38,450
One of them caught
a weapons charge recently.

781
00:31:38,451 --> 00:31:41,707
Trust me. Raids like this,
I used to do in my sleep.

782
00:31:42,386 --> 00:31:43,386
Literally.

783
00:31:48,638 --> 00:31:49,638
Hey, Joe.

784
00:31:49,887 --> 00:31:50,887
Yeah?

785
00:31:51,635 --> 00:31:53,023
You still need a wingman?

786
00:31:55,139 --> 00:31:57,027
I'll have you back here in a hour.

787
00:31:57,311 --> 00:31:58,793
So, what's your shot
in all this?

788
00:31:58,794 --> 00:32:00,022
Punishing these girls for running away,

789
00:32:00,023 --> 00:32:02,783
get back at your own kid
for disappearing?

790
00:32:03,826 --> 00:32:07,675
If it gets one girl to go home,
back to her parents...

791
00:32:09,574 --> 00:32:11,351
That's a gift I was never given.

792
00:32:11,825 --> 00:32:14,047
These girls were only anally penetrated.

793
00:32:14,637 --> 00:32:16,011
This wasn't about pleasure.

794
00:32:16,012 --> 00:32:17,012
It was punishment.

795
00:32:17,949 --> 00:32:19,448
Thing I'm having trouble understanding

796
00:32:19,449 --> 00:32:21,615
is how putting these girls through hell

797
00:32:21,703 --> 00:32:23,012
was going to get your daughter back?

798
00:32:23,013 --> 00:32:25,330
Well, you people gave up
looking for her, didn't you?

799
00:32:25,331 --> 00:32:29,564
3 measly goddamn months
of investigating you just gave up.

800
00:32:32,727 --> 00:32:34,282
Look, I'm responsible, too.

801
00:32:35,539 --> 00:32:36,866
I could've made it easier for her.

802
00:32:36,867 --> 00:32:37,805
But without her mother...

803
00:32:37,806 --> 00:32:39,373
Wait. Why did she leave?

804
00:32:40,789 --> 00:32:42,622
Look, I've told you my story.

805
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:45,438
Find her. She's been
missing for 3 years.

806
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,044
You know what, I may have to rework

807
00:32:50,414 --> 00:32:53,456
the rapist's profile, Steve,
because our suspect

808
00:32:53,726 --> 00:32:55,040
is beginning to look like a person

809
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:57,152
of interest in a murder investigation.

810
00:32:57,288 --> 00:32:58,878
I didn't kill Sabrina!

811
00:32:59,537 --> 00:33:00,537
My own daughter?

812
00:33:01,726 --> 00:33:03,415
Look, she's alive.

813
00:33:03,416 --> 00:33:05,027
I just can't find her myself.

814
00:33:05,163 --> 00:33:06,666
You're still not telling
us the whole truth.

815
00:33:06,667 --> 00:33:10,076
The deal's off unless you come
a hundred percent clean.

816
00:33:10,728 --> 00:33:12,783
You didn't kill her?
Why'd she leave?

817
00:33:17,243 --> 00:33:19,240
Give me the videotape and get out.

818
00:33:19,773 --> 00:33:20,916
Give me the video.

819
00:33:20,917 --> 00:33:22,358
No, no. OK, OK.

820
00:33:23,666 --> 00:33:24,666
No, I'll tell you.

821
00:33:25,793 --> 00:33:29,027
Just make her turn
the camera off first.

822
00:33:30,227 --> 00:33:31,227
Turn it off.

823
00:33:38,101 --> 00:33:40,156
Sabrina's mother died when she was 9.

824
00:33:41,851 --> 00:33:42,851
Hodgkin's disease.

825
00:33:44,542 --> 00:33:45,588
Sabrina never got over it.

826
00:33:45,589 --> 00:33:46,852
I mean...

827
00:33:47,917 --> 00:33:48,917
Neither of us did.

828
00:33:51,853 --> 00:33:52,964
She began to look...

829
00:33:54,106 --> 00:33:55,494
More and more like Carly.

830
00:33:57,855 --> 00:33:58,855
When I'd...

831
00:34:00,853 --> 00:34:03,908
When I'd hold her in my arms
in bed at night, it was...

832
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:07,091
Almost like my wife was still with me.

833
00:34:08,543 --> 00:34:12,098
I don't think Sabrina understood just
how much like her she was.

834
00:34:15,043 --> 00:34:16,043
In every way.

835
00:34:17,977 --> 00:34:19,477
You molested your daughter?

836
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,447
Turn the camera back on, please.

837
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:41,114
Sabrina, honey, if you hear this...

838
00:34:43,104 --> 00:34:44,548
I never meant to hurt you.

839
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:45,729
Oh, Jesus.

840
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,202
I never meant to be so selfish.

841
00:34:57,172 --> 00:34:58,172
Come back home.

842
00:34:58,545 --> 00:34:59,545
Please.

843
00:35:01,795 --> 00:35:03,229
Lester: How long does it take to cop?

844
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:05,225
Spook gives the money,
spook gets the dope.

845
00:35:05,231 --> 00:35:06,842
Been in there for 20 minutes.

846
00:35:08,733 --> 00:35:12,177
With brothers, goddamn handshakes
can burn up 10 minutes easy.

847
00:35:14,668 --> 00:35:15,668
Garlic?

848
00:35:16,609 --> 00:35:17,609
Makes you stink.

849
00:35:18,296 --> 00:35:21,073
Gives you an intimidating
psychological advantage.

850
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:23,980
No, I'll pass.

851
00:35:23,981 --> 00:35:25,592
I'd like to get laid tonight.

852
00:35:26,525 --> 00:35:27,646
I heard that.

853
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,674
Let's do this.

854
00:35:30,857 --> 00:35:31,857
Let's go!

855
00:35:44,895 --> 00:35:45,985
Clear!

856
00:35:46,124 --> 00:35:47,136
Hey!

857
00:35:47,425 --> 00:35:48,310
Hey, ho!

858
00:35:48,311 --> 00:35:49,668
Get away from that damned door!

859
00:35:49,669 --> 00:35:51,696
Get away from it! Down on your knees!
Come on!

860
00:35:51,697 --> 00:35:53,309
Move, man!
Hey, watch it!

861
00:35:59,123 --> 00:36:00,358
Son of a bitch!

862
00:36:10,859 --> 00:36:11,859
Fore!

863
00:36:14,985 --> 00:36:15,985
Clear now.

864
00:36:18,233 --> 00:36:20,546
With a sheepdog, huh?
That's how she made you?

865
00:36:20,547 --> 00:36:22,158
Just read me...
Come on, man.

866
00:36:22,611 --> 00:36:23,611
Come on, man.

867
00:36:24,562 --> 00:36:25,683
Easy, man.
Come on, man.

868
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:26,731
The locks, man!

869
00:36:26,732 --> 00:36:28,071
You ain't no real cops!
Shut up!

870
00:36:28,072 --> 00:36:29,072
How much you want?

871
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:30,885
We'll cut you
devils in for half.

872
00:36:30,886 --> 00:36:32,052
Gimme the super glue.

873
00:36:32,574 --> 00:36:33,574
Get his hands.

874
00:36:33,762 --> 00:36:34,762
Get his hands.

875
00:36:35,824 --> 00:36:36,824
Come on!

876
00:36:38,247 --> 00:36:39,247
You dumb...

877
00:36:41,371 --> 00:36:43,473
All righty.
Get up. Go on.

878
00:36:43,811 --> 00:36:45,248
This is some felonious bullshit, man!

879
00:36:45,249 --> 00:36:46,427
Shut up.

880
00:36:46,622 --> 00:36:49,481
Assholes who don't
listen don't get to speak.

881
00:36:50,259 --> 00:36:50,873
Hey, hey, hey!

882
00:36:51,184 --> 00:36:52,184
That's enough.

883
00:37:03,808 --> 00:37:05,134
Man: What do you want, man?

884
00:37:05,135 --> 00:37:06,903
Money? Ganja?

885
00:37:07,249 --> 00:37:07,969
Come on, bitch!
Come on, bitch!

886
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:09,487
Take it, take it.
Take it! Jesus!

887
00:37:09,704 --> 00:37:10,734
Come on. Get in there!

888
00:37:11,439 --> 00:37:12,613
Come on!

889
00:37:15,248 --> 00:37:16,956
Piss or bleed. Your choice.

890
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:21,619
Oh, boy.

891
00:37:22,562 --> 00:37:23,733
That's it, baby.

892
00:37:26,059 --> 00:37:27,059
Yeah.

893
00:37:27,187 --> 00:37:28,184
Yeah.

894
00:37:28,185 --> 00:37:29,185
That's good!

895
00:37:29,248 --> 00:37:30,248
Now...

896
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:34,365
Like a good fella, take a drink
out of the toilet and lap it up.

897
00:37:34,624 --> 00:37:36,713
- Lap it up.
- No, man. I ain't getting...

898
00:37:36,714 --> 00:37:38,829
Man, come on, drink! Drink!

899
00:37:39,125 --> 00:37:40,125
Lap it up, boy!

900
00:37:40,626 --> 00:37:42,182
Lap it! Yeah!

901
00:37:45,381 --> 00:37:47,043
That's it!
Jesus Christ!

902
00:37:50,811 --> 00:37:52,624
This is your official eviction notice.

903
00:37:52,625 --> 00:37:54,686
As of right now, you are
no longer tenants of this building.

904
00:37:54,687 --> 00:37:55,170
You hear me?

905
00:37:55,171 --> 00:37:56,855
Yeah, man.
Yeah, man.

906
00:38:19,754 --> 00:38:21,615
Landlord's got another apartment
building in south central.

907
00:38:21,616 --> 00:38:22,750
I'm done.

908
00:38:22,753 --> 00:38:23,876
I'll get rid of Lester.

909
00:38:23,877 --> 00:38:25,210
I'll help you with that.

910
00:38:25,922 --> 00:38:27,617
Guess all that bad ass noise

911
00:38:27,626 --> 00:38:29,237
I heard about you's bullshit.

912
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,938
Guess so. Look, you guys
are going the other way.

913
00:38:31,939 --> 00:38:33,563
I'll call a black and white for a ride.

914
00:38:33,564 --> 00:38:34,562
Come on, Vic. Get in, get in.

915
00:38:34,563 --> 00:38:36,507
Let him go, man.
We don't need him.

916
00:38:37,063 --> 00:38:37,918
Word is most of the guys

917
00:38:37,919 --> 00:38:39,439
on his team end up dead anyhow.

918
00:38:42,505 --> 00:38:43,505
Vic.

919
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:46,940
Vic!

920
00:38:55,752 --> 00:38:58,648
Detective! Did Sabrina make the news?

921
00:38:59,034 --> 00:39:00,118
Yeah, it was the lead story.

922
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:02,486
Oh, good.
Oh, that's good.

923
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,288
After the segment ran,

924
00:39:04,939 --> 00:39:07,050
another division got an anonymous tip.

925
00:39:08,005 --> 00:39:09,002
Said they'd find her body

926
00:39:09,003 --> 00:39:10,891
out in a grave near lake Elsinore.

927
00:39:11,505 --> 00:39:13,282
Police there just dug up a body.

928
00:39:16,952 --> 00:39:20,277
No. No, that's
somebody else's little girl.

929
00:39:20,278 --> 00:39:23,651
It's not... That's just some
kind of a prank, is what that is!

930
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:27,374
Some asshole saw the story
and just wanted to hurt me!

931
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,941
No. My Sabrina just needs to hear me.

932
00:39:29,942 --> 00:39:31,108
Ask her to come home.

933
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:33,856
Your daughter's dead!

934
00:39:34,506 --> 00:39:35,442
You made her run away!

935
00:39:35,443 --> 00:39:36,443
She got killed!

936
00:40:08,884 --> 00:40:10,661
That's Hernan in the blue shirt.

937
00:40:11,007 --> 00:40:13,131
I sweet-talked the I.C.E.
queen into letting us

938
00:40:13,132 --> 00:40:14,943
have some face time with the boy,

939
00:40:14,944 --> 00:40:17,055
so long as I promised we'll be subtle.

940
00:40:17,255 --> 00:40:19,866
Gonna have to treat him
like any other bad guy.

941
00:40:20,379 --> 00:40:21,318
Ready?

942
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:22,319
- Yeah.
- Here we go.

943
00:40:38,758 --> 00:40:40,573
Hey, stop, stop fighting!

944
00:40:40,808 --> 00:40:41,567
We know who you are.

945
00:40:41,568 --> 00:40:42,487
You're Hernan.

946
00:40:42,488 --> 00:40:44,443
Agent Zinman told me where to find you.

947
00:40:44,444 --> 00:40:45,444
Who are you?

948
00:40:45,508 --> 00:40:46,696
We're on the same side.

949
00:40:46,697 --> 00:40:47,697
Get up. Come on.

950
00:40:50,779 --> 00:40:52,080
Make it look great for the boys.

951
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:56,634
We heard about some trouble

952
00:40:56,635 --> 00:40:58,256
with the salvadorans and the mexicans.

953
00:40:58,257 --> 00:41:00,757
Tell me you assholes didn't risk
blowing my cover for that.

954
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:03,193
What we got is the salvadorans
might have called for a hit

955
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:04,527
on the San Marcos house,

956
00:41:04,946 --> 00:41:07,834
then the mexicans retaliated
by killing Guardo Lima.

957
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:09,923
It wasn't the salvis.

958
00:41:10,322 --> 00:41:12,266
Word is it was some other mexicans.

959
00:41:12,507 --> 00:41:13,507
Killed their own?

960
00:41:13,758 --> 00:41:14,570
Unlikely.

961
00:41:14,571 --> 00:41:16,634
Especially when one of the victims
was a government official.

962
00:41:16,635 --> 00:41:18,246
Eduardo Romero. You know him?

963
00:41:18,507 --> 00:41:20,562
No. It's probably some internal beef.

964
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:24,298
Look, my guess...
Guardo's collateral damage.

965
00:41:24,479 --> 00:41:26,006
Well, it serves him right.

966
00:41:26,007 --> 00:41:27,510
Prick blew up a friend of mine.

967
00:41:27,511 --> 00:41:30,479
What, that cop?
Guardo didn't do that.

968
00:41:30,948 --> 00:41:33,820
I don't care what side
this guy's on, he's full of shit.

969
00:41:33,821 --> 00:41:35,947
We all knew Emolia
was snitching to I.A.D.

970
00:41:35,948 --> 00:41:38,446
We knew she was up in
the safe house on Harvest.

971
00:41:38,447 --> 00:41:41,258
We know she's up in Seattle
right now at her sister's.

972
00:41:41,259 --> 00:41:43,481
But the word came down, no distractions.

973
00:41:45,008 --> 00:41:47,072
These guys don't take out their own rat,

974
00:41:47,073 --> 00:41:48,135
no way they'd kill a cop.

975
00:41:48,136 --> 00:41:49,302
It was somebody else.

976
00:41:50,139 --> 00:41:52,250
Shit, Guardo wasn't even up here then.

977
00:41:52,448 --> 00:41:53,836
He was in Mexico with me.

978
00:41:57,884 --> 00:41:59,884
Is anyone gonna make this look good?

979
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:03,394
Come on, come on!

980
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:05,146
Get up for me!

981
00:42:05,584 --> 00:42:06,861
Guardo didn't kill Lem.

982
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:08,635
Maybe he's wrong...

983
00:42:08,646 --> 00:42:09,646
He's not wrong!

984
00:42:11,643 --> 00:42:12,643
He's not wrong.

985
00:42:13,173 --> 00:42:14,203
Gimme your hand.

986
00:42:30,582 --> 00:42:31,582
Get out.

987
00:42:31,583 --> 00:42:32,709
Baby, please...

988
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,268
Just go.

989
00:42:34,269 --> 00:42:36,018
Please, just ask me to come back.

990
00:42:36,019 --> 00:42:37,019
No.

991
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:39,827
Baby, please, I'm begging you, please.

992
00:42:40,144 --> 00:42:42,863
Just ask me to come back
right now. Please.

993
00:42:50,647 --> 00:42:52,731
Our son is in the other room.

994
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:59,134
OK. You've got to forgive me.

995
00:42:59,135 --> 00:43:01,956
Look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
What I did was wrong.

996
00:43:01,957 --> 00:43:04,271
I know it. Please, Mara, please.

997
00:43:04,272 --> 00:43:07,235
God. Please, just take me back.

998
00:43:07,666 --> 00:43:10,829
You want me to forgive you
for sleeping with a girl

999
00:43:11,023 --> 00:43:13,991
that is barely out
of an inner-city middle school?

1000
00:43:14,211 --> 00:43:16,793
Forget it. Go ahead. Shoot me.

1001
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:19,663
Shoot yourself. I'm not forgiving you.

1002
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:22,071
Jackson can never know what I've done.

1003
00:43:23,396 --> 00:43:25,562
Our son can never know what we've done.

1004
00:43:30,709 --> 00:43:32,820
Did Vic get you involved in something?

1005
00:43:34,001 --> 00:43:35,314
He doesn't even know.

1006
00:43:41,523 --> 00:43:42,523
I killed Lem.

1007
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,023
I did.

1008
00:43:46,397 --> 00:43:47,397
I did it.

1009
00:43:47,522 --> 00:43:48,522
I did it.

1010
00:43:50,087 --> 00:43:53,198
I dropped the grenade in his lap
and I just walked away.

1011
00:43:54,961 --> 00:43:55,961
And he was...

1012
00:43:56,211 --> 00:43:59,942
He was still breathing, he was alive,

1013
00:44:00,336 --> 00:44:01,336
and I just...

1014
00:44:02,633 --> 00:44:04,613
I just left him there, you know.

1015
00:44:04,614 --> 00:44:05,900
I just... No.

1016
00:44:06,152 --> 00:44:08,470
Mara, I-I killed him.

1017
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:12,460
Why?

1018
00:44:12,776 --> 00:44:13,776
For us.

1019
00:44:14,211 --> 00:44:15,433
Mara, I did it for us.

1020
00:44:16,648 --> 00:44:18,592
I thought he was gonna take a deal.

1021
00:44:18,835 --> 00:44:20,779
That he was gonna give us all away.

1022
00:44:22,799 --> 00:44:25,299
I thought he was gonna
take me away from you,

1023
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:28,043
from Jackson, from our baby.

1024
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,360
I didn't know what else to do, Mara.

1025
00:44:34,855 --> 00:44:36,680
Now it's all wrong.

1026
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:38,300
It's all wrong.

1027
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:40,276
It just keeps going all wrong.

1028
00:44:42,609 --> 00:44:46,537
God, please, God, please,
please forgive me, please!

1029
00:44:46,555 --> 00:44:48,609
I can't... I can't do this any more.

1030
00:44:48,802 --> 00:44:49,802
I'm sorry.

1031
00:44:50,115 --> 00:44:51,561
Please, just ask me back.
