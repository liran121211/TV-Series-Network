1
00:00:00,245 --> 00:00:01,745
<i>Previously on The Shield...</i>

2
00:00:02,055 --> 00:00:03,055
He's got a gun!

3
00:00:07,745 --> 00:00:08,745
Grenades.

4
00:00:08,993 --> 00:00:10,056
We gotta go get Lem.

5
00:00:10,057 --> 00:00:12,121
He doesn't show,
assume he made the deal.

6
00:00:12,122 --> 00:00:14,010
They're gonna make you
give us up.

7
00:00:16,745 --> 00:00:17,745
Shane?

8
00:00:20,245 --> 00:00:21,245
Grenades.

9
00:00:21,371 --> 00:00:23,861
El salvadorans.
The leader's missing.

10
00:00:24,185 --> 00:00:25,532
His name is Guardo.
Start there.

11
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:28,053
We're gonna find out who did this,
and we're gonna kill 'em.

12
00:00:28,054 --> 00:00:29,276
Why am I trusting you?

13
00:00:29,757 --> 00:00:32,256
If you care about Guardo,
you'll play it my way.

14
00:00:32,554 --> 00:00:33,554
Just let Nydia go.

15
00:00:33,735 --> 00:00:35,735
She's how we're gonna get to Guardo.

16
00:00:35,984 --> 00:00:37,608
You know, maybe he didn't do it, man.

17
00:00:37,664 --> 00:00:40,328
- If it wasn't Guardo, who was it?
- Look at him, man!

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,605
Tilly, we know about you and Shane.
He's in the hospital.

19
00:00:47,606 --> 00:00:49,874
You stepped out and now
you're spreading your legs for Shane?

20
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:51,597
Her old man got the drop on me.

21
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:53,563
Some black bitch called on your phone.

22
00:00:53,564 --> 00:00:55,811
Is that who you're banging
while I got morning sickness?

23
00:00:55,812 --> 00:00:56,812
Get out!

24
00:00:57,596 --> 00:00:59,328
What do you know about
a guy named Hernan?

25
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:02,258
He's a Fed', undercover,
in a salvadoran organization.

26
00:01:02,482 --> 00:01:03,466
Who are you?

27
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:04,787
We're on the same side.

28
00:01:05,072 --> 00:01:05,883
Who are less in trouble,

29
00:01:05,884 --> 00:01:07,133
the salvadorans or the mexicans?

30
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:09,072
I guess Guardo is collateral damage.

31
00:01:09,073 --> 00:01:10,572
Prick blew up a friend of mine.

32
00:01:10,573 --> 00:01:12,323
What, that cop? Guardo didn't do that.

33
00:01:12,324 --> 00:01:14,196
The word came down. No distractions.

34
00:01:14,197 --> 00:01:16,009
Shit, Guardo wasn't even up here then.

35
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,398
He was in Mexico with me.

36
00:01:18,219 --> 00:01:20,330
Our son can never know what I've done.

37
00:01:20,698 --> 00:01:21,906
I killed Lem.

38
00:01:22,072 --> 00:01:23,669
Please forgive me. Please.

39
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,504
I can't... I can't do this anymore.
I'm sorry.

40
00:01:26,631 --> 00:01:27,964
Please just ask me back.

41
00:01:35,945 --> 00:01:37,865
Who's got it? Eye's up!

42
00:01:38,027 --> 00:01:40,193
Nobody wants to talk.
Don't look at me!

43
00:01:40,338 --> 00:01:41,338
Somebody's got it.

44
00:01:41,839 --> 00:01:43,561
Can't do nothing in this place.

45
00:01:43,965 --> 00:01:46,104
All right, ladies.
This ain't your first time at the dance.

46
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:47,716
You know the drill.
Drop 'em.

47
00:01:48,153 --> 00:01:50,760
Oh, yeah, pretty boy.
You got a lot to think about.

48
00:01:50,761 --> 00:01:51,968
Take your time.

49
00:01:52,778 --> 00:01:53,778
Not you. Hurry up!

50
00:01:55,237 --> 00:01:56,148
Come on, move!

51
00:01:56,778 --> 00:01:57,778
I want your shoes.

52
00:01:58,341 --> 00:02:01,118
I want your pants, your shirts.
Neat little piles.

53
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,530
Is he alone?

54
00:02:03,085 --> 00:02:05,035
From the sound of it,
it's a do not disturb.

55
00:02:12,051 --> 00:02:13,683
Yeah. Come in.

56
00:02:16,495 --> 00:02:17,495
What is it, Benny?

57
00:02:18,237 --> 00:02:19,788
You have a visitor, Antwon.

58
00:02:19,789 --> 00:02:21,002
What does Rene look like here?

59
00:02:21,188 --> 00:02:22,414
I know. I'm sorry.

60
00:02:22,655 --> 00:02:25,511
I know my visitor can't be
half as fine as Rene.

61
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:27,470
Ain't that right, baby?

62
00:02:28,656 --> 00:02:29,656
Better be right.

63
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:32,490
Some white cop from L.A.

64
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:36,522
He's pressing the warden
about seeing you right away.

65
00:02:36,693 --> 00:02:37,808
Give me 2 shakes.

66
00:02:38,023 --> 00:02:39,740
And shut that damn dog up.

67
00:02:40,835 --> 00:02:43,390
Now I ain't got time for
sweet nothings, baby.

68
00:02:44,585 --> 00:02:45,525
You gonna have to show me

69
00:02:45,526 --> 00:02:47,581
what the good God gave you right now.

70
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:49,459
Come here.

71
00:02:59,454 --> 00:03:02,168
My day just gets sunnier and sunnier.

72
00:03:02,725 --> 00:03:03,681
How's life in prison?

73
00:03:05,453 --> 00:03:06,326
Much better now

74
00:03:06,327 --> 00:03:08,604
that Kavanaugh went down
for framing you.

75
00:03:09,306 --> 00:03:10,583
Got my privileges back.

76
00:03:11,808 --> 00:03:13,812
I didn't know we still
had business together.

77
00:03:13,807 --> 00:03:17,918
You mean since my guy, who you put
a hit out on, got a grenade in his lap?

78
00:03:17,932 --> 00:03:18,987
I heard about that.

79
00:03:19,057 --> 00:03:21,306
Gotta give somebody points
for creativity.

80
00:03:21,307 --> 00:03:22,875
Yeah. You.

81
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:26,244
I know you've been wanting
your pound of flesh from me,

82
00:03:26,245 --> 00:03:28,133
waiting for Lem to come into jail.

83
00:03:28,871 --> 00:03:33,005
But he ran, so you had your guys
on the outside find him, kill him.

84
00:03:33,184 --> 00:03:34,769
Make it look salvadoran.

85
00:03:36,621 --> 00:03:37,621
One time offer.

86
00:03:38,496 --> 00:03:41,162
Tell me who it was
on the outside who offed Lem,

87
00:03:42,601 --> 00:03:44,315
punishment will be limited to them.

88
00:03:44,871 --> 00:03:47,315
You don't give me all
their names right now,

89
00:03:48,017 --> 00:03:50,584
I will start tearing up
your gang from the outside

90
00:03:50,747 --> 00:03:53,307
and I will start tearing
at your perks from the inside

91
00:03:53,308 --> 00:03:55,640
and I promise you, I swear to God,

92
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:58,277
I will find a way,

93
00:03:58,278 --> 00:04:00,892
no matter how many guards
you have on your payroll,

94
00:04:00,934 --> 00:04:02,524
to get to you inside here.

95
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,056
And that, ladies and gentlemen,

96
00:04:08,301 --> 00:04:09,944
is my final encore.

97
00:04:10,933 --> 00:04:12,804
Making the great Vic Mackey

98
00:04:12,805 --> 00:04:14,160
think I'm everyone...

99
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:15,981
and everywhere.

100
00:04:16,501 --> 00:04:20,681
Responsible for all the
worst crimes against humanity.

101
00:04:22,928 --> 00:04:23,928
It's sad, really.

102
00:04:24,741 --> 00:04:27,629
You know, chasing ghosts
hasn't done you any favors.

103
00:04:31,429 --> 00:04:33,425
I didn't off your boy.

104
00:04:34,119 --> 00:04:36,174
Wished I did, and so do you.

105
00:04:36,678 --> 00:04:39,011
'cause if you're
coming after me for this,

106
00:04:39,115 --> 00:04:40,755
that means you lost...

107
00:04:41,405 --> 00:04:42,779
your last clue.

108
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,448
Good seeing you, though.

109
00:04:51,742 --> 00:04:53,303
He says, daddy, I got a boo-boo.

110
00:04:53,494 --> 00:04:55,185
- Shane!
- But my boo-boo's on the inside.

111
00:04:55,371 --> 00:04:56,365
- Oh!
- I talk to you later.

112
00:04:57,117 --> 00:04:58,866
- When'd you get in, man?
- About 10 minutes ago.

113
00:04:58,867 --> 00:04:59,741
We got a problem.

114
00:04:59,742 --> 00:05:00,740
What?

115
00:05:00,741 --> 00:05:02,018
Guardo didn't kill Lem.

116
00:05:02,121 --> 00:05:04,171
No one in the salvadoran
organization did.

117
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,303
What?

118
00:05:05,304 --> 00:05:06,859
Took a flyer at Antwon, too.

119
00:05:07,305 --> 00:05:08,360
1-9ers are a no go.

120
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,304
We're back to square one.

121
00:05:10,305 --> 00:05:14,094
No, Guardo's in a bunch of
charred pieces and crispy...

122
00:05:14,095 --> 00:05:15,061
He didn't do it.

123
00:05:15,305 --> 00:05:16,491
We got credible intel.

124
00:05:16,492 --> 00:05:17,179
From who?

125
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,283
A federal I.C.E. agent
working undercover with the salvadorans.

126
00:05:20,284 --> 00:05:21,656
So now the Fed's have the final say?

127
00:05:21,831 --> 00:05:23,372
You know how many times
they've lied to us

128
00:05:23,373 --> 00:05:24,921
to keep us from playing
in their backyard?

129
00:05:24,922 --> 00:05:26,199
Doesn't feel like that.

130
00:05:26,672 --> 00:05:28,834
So he's the rare Fed' that lies well.

131
00:05:29,421 --> 00:05:30,698
Look, we finished this.

132
00:05:30,795 --> 00:05:34,027
There's nothing more
to find out, all right?

133
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,303
Hey, Dutch, where are
we with Lem's case?

134
00:05:41,304 --> 00:05:43,803
Holding pattern.
Still working on finding Guardo.

135
00:05:43,804 --> 00:05:46,470
Guardo's a dead end.
I got it right from Hernan.

136
00:05:46,845 --> 00:05:48,090
You met with Hernan?

137
00:05:48,679 --> 00:05:50,616
I.C.E. Told me I couldn't get a sitdown.

138
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:52,061
What's the lab report say?

139
00:05:52,179 --> 00:05:53,403
It's not back yet.

140
00:05:54,179 --> 00:05:54,865
It's due.

141
00:05:54,866 --> 00:05:56,678
I got a dead cop and no
suspect at the moment.

142
00:05:56,679 --> 00:05:58,991
You think you could light
a fire under their bunsen burner?

143
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:00,203
Yeah. Maybe.

144
00:06:00,679 --> 00:06:01,306
Yeah?

145
00:06:01,307 --> 00:06:04,179
Did something happen last
weekend when you had Cassidy?

146
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,457
<i>Something to upset her?</i>

147
00:06:05,492 --> 00:06:06,368
No. Why?

148
00:06:06,369 --> 00:06:08,115
Well, she says she won't
stay with you next weekend

149
00:06:08,116 --> 00:06:10,118
when I go to San Francisco
with Mattie and Megan

150
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,615
for the cure autism now rally.

151
00:06:11,616 --> 00:06:12,429
Why not?

152
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,992
She doesn't want to talk about it.

153
00:06:13,993 --> 00:06:16,867
I've already got the hotel reservations,
the plane tickets.

154
00:06:16,868 --> 00:06:19,241
I'll talk to her.
Whatever it is, we'll fix it.

155
00:06:19,242 --> 00:06:20,555
In the meantime,
I'm stuck here.

156
00:06:20,556 --> 00:06:22,805
You think you could drive
Cassidy over here later?

157
00:06:22,806 --> 00:06:23,993
She won't talk to you.

158
00:06:23,994 --> 00:06:25,117
<i>Well, that's not up to her.</i>

159
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:26,244
I'll talk to you later.

160
00:06:26,245 --> 00:06:28,117
We're running a list
of ex-military felons in the area.

161
00:06:28,118 --> 00:06:30,562
Maybe they got Lem's grenade
from uncle Sam.

162
00:06:36,004 --> 00:06:37,933
Uh, interesting reading?

163
00:06:38,193 --> 00:06:40,248
Just checking out real estate prices.

164
00:06:40,249 --> 00:06:41,317
Trying to see what this house

165
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,706
Mara and I are fixing up
is gonna be worth.

166
00:06:44,424 --> 00:06:46,924
You wanna jump in
on this Lem thing anywhere?

167
00:06:47,237 --> 00:06:48,403
It's a waste of time.

168
00:06:48,987 --> 00:06:49,987
We settled this.

169
00:06:50,302 --> 00:06:51,299
We can't be sure.

170
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,799
This I.C.E. agent,
he has no reason to lie to us.

171
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,300
You were sure enough to put a bullet
in Guardo before he confessed,

172
00:06:57,301 --> 00:06:58,523
and I trusted you then

173
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:02,360
that we knew everything we were
ever going to know about that happened.

174
00:07:02,361 --> 00:07:04,083
And you did what you had to do.

175
00:07:04,301 --> 00:07:05,301
We all did.

176
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:08,829
Now just put this
in the rearview mirror.

177
00:07:08,988 --> 00:07:11,821
Stop asking questions that
there are no answers to.

178
00:07:19,926 --> 00:07:21,870
Whatever funk he was in seems over.

179
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:25,611
He seems at peace with it.

180
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,278
I don't know how I can be
until I know for sure.

181
00:07:31,301 --> 00:07:34,912
When we took down that stash of grenades
the night that Lem died,

182
00:07:36,113 --> 00:07:38,376
Shane did the con solo, right?

183
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:39,675
Vic, come on.

184
00:07:39,676 --> 00:07:41,787
Did you see anything weird that night?

185
00:07:42,113 --> 00:07:43,390
About Lem? The night...

186
00:07:43,489 --> 00:07:44,987
No. No.

187
00:07:50,116 --> 00:07:52,306
He did say, um...

188
00:07:53,803 --> 00:07:55,593
When Kavanaugh's frameup job was going

189
00:07:55,732 --> 00:07:56,726
and things looked really bad,

190
00:07:56,727 --> 00:07:58,066
he said something like...

191
00:07:58,803 --> 00:08:00,862
What if he said he had
a grenade from the bust

192
00:08:00,863 --> 00:08:03,585
and he was with Lem and
it went off accidentally?

193
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:06,113
I just took it as him
want to lie to get you off.

194
00:08:06,114 --> 00:08:07,114
What did you say?

195
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,036
I said it wouldn't help

196
00:08:08,037 --> 00:08:10,262
and he'd be admitting
aiding and abetting.

197
00:08:10,429 --> 00:08:11,429
What did he say?

198
00:08:13,428 --> 00:08:14,428
Nothing.

199
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:22,238
You don't remember Shane's count
on grenades that night?

200
00:08:22,239 --> 00:08:24,127
Not here. At the salvadoran house?

201
00:08:24,241 --> 00:08:25,930
Jesus, Vic, I don't want
to think like that.

202
00:08:25,931 --> 00:08:27,653
Do you rember the count or not?

203
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:30,927
Write it down.

204
00:08:35,491 --> 00:08:36,491
What do you have?

205
00:08:37,304 --> 00:08:39,121
73, like the home run record.

206
00:08:44,429 --> 00:08:45,595
We gotta run a check.

207
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:48,459
What are we saying here?

208
00:08:49,867 --> 00:08:51,089
All we're saying is...

209
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,177
As soon as we can...

210
00:08:56,292 --> 00:08:57,295
The first chance you get,

211
00:08:57,296 --> 00:08:58,503
you... you're gonna...

212
00:08:58,856 --> 00:09:00,545
quietly confirm

213
00:09:00,546 --> 00:09:02,701
that Shane logged in 73 grenades

214
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,935
and that all 73 grenades are still
sitting there nice and neat

215
00:09:07,596 --> 00:09:09,342
in the bomb squad
evidence locker.

<i>Chasing Ghosts</i>

219
00:09:28,992 --> 00:09:29,992
Morning.

220
00:09:32,553 --> 00:09:34,108
Mind if I take one of these?

221
00:09:41,118 --> 00:09:42,118
Was this Lem's?

222
00:09:43,369 --> 00:09:44,797
I'm sorry. I didn't...

223
00:09:44,928 --> 00:09:46,428
No, no, no. It's all right.

224
00:09:46,741 --> 00:09:47,992
You're part of the team now.

225
00:09:47,993 --> 00:09:49,604
No reason it should go empty.

226
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,554
Trust me. If i'm wrong,
I'll buy you a beer.

227
00:09:51,555 --> 00:09:52,777
Hey, there, gentlemen.

228
00:09:54,367 --> 00:09:56,089
Well, someone had a good night.

229
00:09:56,116 --> 00:09:57,838
Pregnancy sex is the best kind.

230
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,679
Give you something to look forward to.

231
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,346
Thanks. I'll give Mara a call.

232
00:10:02,492 --> 00:10:03,743
Just the crew I'm looking for.

233
00:10:03,744 --> 00:10:05,993
Got a body in an apartment
building on colby.

234
00:10:05,994 --> 00:10:07,382
Young woman. 20. Stabbed.

235
00:10:07,493 --> 00:10:09,430
We taking straight up homicides now?

236
00:10:09,431 --> 00:10:10,980
Victim's Emily Martin.

237
00:10:11,185 --> 00:10:12,992
Daughter of the city
controller Robert Martin.

238
00:10:12,993 --> 00:10:15,056
The guy that's got his fingers
on the city's purse strings.

239
00:10:15,057 --> 00:10:16,702
That's our special touch.

240
00:10:16,743 --> 00:10:18,305
A lot of people will be watching.

241
00:10:18,306 --> 00:10:21,028
Aceveda called himself
to ask for extra manpower.

242
00:10:21,556 --> 00:10:23,167
Just rember who you work for.

243
00:10:25,016 --> 00:10:27,181
These high profile cases
are just one big invitation

244
00:10:27,182 --> 00:10:28,618
to get ass reamed by the bosses.

245
00:10:28,619 --> 00:10:29,367
So let's get it done

246
00:10:29,368 --> 00:10:30,743
and get out of the spotlight.

247
00:10:30,744 --> 00:10:31,993
Let's try not to get ass reamed.

248
00:10:31,994 --> 00:10:34,116
Well, it wasn't a robbery.

249
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,258
The extent of the wounds?

250
00:10:37,494 --> 00:10:39,216
Someone gave her an O.J. shave.

251
00:10:39,244 --> 00:10:41,056
A long way from daddy's wave of power.

252
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,369
Maybe she got tired
of the west side.

253
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:43,619
You guys know the drill.

254
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,806
Look for nosy neighbors.

255
00:10:44,807 --> 00:10:46,557
Something there.
Maybe a shoe print.

256
00:10:46,558 --> 00:10:47,680
Good work, eagle eye.

257
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:49,847
I knew they bumped him up for a reason.

258
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:52,906
Come on. Let's start over here.

259
00:10:55,397 --> 00:10:56,397
Police. Open up.

260
00:10:57,334 --> 00:10:58,945
Hey, there's the poster girl.

261
00:10:59,127 --> 00:11:00,464
Looking good, Tina.

262
00:11:01,189 --> 00:11:03,232
Bow down to the poster girl.

263
00:11:04,835 --> 00:11:06,946
Man, I guess wet dreams
can come true.

264
00:11:07,336 --> 00:11:09,137
Hey, how you doing?

265
00:11:09,526 --> 00:11:10,748
I'm good. How are you?

266
00:11:11,836 --> 00:11:15,078
Good. I called you a couple of times.

267
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:17,047
Is everything copacetic?

268
00:11:17,213 --> 00:11:19,490
Yeah. Well, you heard
about the transfer.

269
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:22,524
They basically wanted me
in some P.R. role.

270
00:11:22,525 --> 00:11:25,802
talking in schools,
recruitment meetings, things like that.

271
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:27,247
You mean the poster.

272
00:11:27,448 --> 00:11:28,892
Yeah, that's all that was.

273
00:11:29,574 --> 00:11:32,614
But I got to meet a couple of
people up at the chief's office

274
00:11:32,615 --> 00:11:35,947
and convinced 'em that I could represent
the force better out in the streets.

275
00:11:35,948 --> 00:11:37,612
Well, I think you belong here.

276
00:11:38,262 --> 00:11:40,072
Dutch, there's a woman in the lobby

277
00:11:40,073 --> 00:11:41,906
who wants to talk to a detective.

278
00:11:41,948 --> 00:11:42,948
Uh, Steve's free.

279
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,255
She said actually
that it's about Guardo Lima.

280
00:11:46,336 --> 00:11:48,336
That's your suspect
in Lem's murder case, right?

281
00:11:48,337 --> 00:11:49,663
Uh, yeah. Excuse me.

282
00:11:50,275 --> 00:11:51,330
Tina, welcome back.

283
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:54,739
We should talk about
your new assignment.

284
00:11:56,295 --> 00:11:57,213
Ok.

285
00:11:58,494 --> 00:12:00,439
You heard that Julian's
on the Strike Team, yeah?

286
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,634
Yeah. Yeah.

287
00:12:01,894 --> 00:12:03,230
So who am I riding with?

288
00:12:03,231 --> 00:12:04,231
Well, for now, me.

289
00:12:05,881 --> 00:12:06,881
Is that a problem?

290
00:12:07,006 --> 00:12:09,285
No, no. You're a Sergeant now,

291
00:12:09,286 --> 00:12:11,304
and Sergeants don't get out that much.

292
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,410
That's ok. I'm gonna keep you real busy.

293
00:12:13,411 --> 00:12:14,522
It's only temporary.

294
00:12:14,598 --> 00:12:16,596
You have information about Guardo Lima?

295
00:12:16,597 --> 00:12:18,586
He's missing. Something bad's happened.

296
00:12:18,587 --> 00:12:20,334
When was the last time you spoke to him?

297
00:12:20,335 --> 00:12:22,013
He hasn't called me in over a week.

298
00:12:22,014 --> 00:12:23,906
Well, that doesn't necessarily
mean anything's wrong.

299
00:12:23,907 --> 00:12:25,695
We talk every day. He loves me.

300
00:12:25,836 --> 00:12:27,724
No one has seen or heard from him.

301
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,612
Was it Salseda?

302
00:12:30,702 --> 00:12:31,702
Who's Salseda.

303
00:12:31,764 --> 00:12:35,887
A mexican. He's the one who wanted
to take over the business Guardo ran.

304
00:12:36,263 --> 00:12:37,818
That cop knows all about it.

305
00:12:37,889 --> 00:12:38,896
He's the one who told me

306
00:12:38,897 --> 00:12:40,763
that Salseda wanted to kill Guardo.

307
00:12:40,764 --> 00:12:42,014
OK, which cop?

308
00:12:42,015 --> 00:12:43,765
I'm the one they had
in protective custody,

309
00:12:43,766 --> 00:12:46,821
so don't pretend you don't
know what i'm talking about.

310
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,782
Kevin Hiatt, this is
Robert and Patricia Martin.

311
00:12:51,865 --> 00:12:54,043
Kevin's heading up the team
that's doing the investigation.

312
00:12:54,044 --> 00:12:55,355
I'm sorry about your loss.

313
00:12:55,356 --> 00:12:55,918
Thank you.

314
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:57,576
The Martins are friends
of the department

315
00:12:57,577 --> 00:12:59,230
and I told them I'd be their go-between.

316
00:12:59,231 --> 00:13:01,502
Emily was a beautiful,
wonderful young woman.

317
00:13:01,503 --> 00:13:03,628
Do you know what she was
doing in this part of town?

318
00:13:03,629 --> 00:13:05,127
Our daughter didn't deserve this,

319
00:13:05,128 --> 00:13:06,254
and my wife doesn't deserve

320
00:13:06,255 --> 00:13:08,091
to be put through anything else.

321
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:09,254
Of course.

322
00:13:09,504 --> 00:13:10,504
Give me a second.

323
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,920
The Martins are dealing with a tragedy.

324
00:13:18,941 --> 00:13:21,003
Lots of people might try
to paint this a certain way,

325
00:13:21,004 --> 00:13:24,401
so we can't let anybody
sully this girl's reputation.

326
00:13:25,348 --> 00:13:26,879
Yeah, sure.

327
00:13:30,691 --> 00:13:33,636
Hey, witness says he saw
his neighbor Rahid Moore

328
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,735
hurrying out carrying 2 trash bags.

329
00:13:35,792 --> 00:13:37,854
6 flights up, he still took the stairs.

330
00:13:37,855 --> 00:13:40,138
People say he's loud.
Gets visitors all night long.

331
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:42,454
When they've asked him to keep it down,
he's made threats.

332
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:43,642
Apartment's right over here.

333
00:13:43,643 --> 00:13:44,447
Let's pay a visit.

334
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,675
- Uh, Vic?
- What's the problem?

335
00:13:46,676 --> 00:13:49,133
Aceveda and the old man want us
to keep the daughter clean.

336
00:13:49,134 --> 00:13:51,082
We don't even know
what we're supposed to be hiding yet.

337
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:51,951
Hiding, hmm?

338
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,074
I'll help you figure that out.

339
00:13:53,075 --> 00:13:54,908
Just keep it to yourself for now.

340
00:13:55,075 --> 00:13:56,963
Look, city controller on one side,

341
00:13:57,014 --> 00:13:58,763
Claudette's moral code on the other.

342
00:13:58,764 --> 00:14:01,650
So whoever you screw, you
get cut off at the knees.

343
00:14:01,873 --> 00:14:02,540
Fantastic.

344
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:05,346
Trust me. There's a way out.
There always is.

345
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:07,410
First we find out the truth.

346
00:14:07,857 --> 00:14:09,523
Then we figure out what to do.

347
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:15,841
Late night visitors
means late night customers.

348
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:19,292
He packed up his stash
and got out of dodge.

349
00:14:19,293 --> 00:14:20,606
If Rahid had a parking spot,

350
00:14:20,607 --> 00:14:21,980
the building will have his plate.

351
00:14:21,981 --> 00:14:23,314
I'll get it on the wire.

352
00:14:23,918 --> 00:14:24,918
Anything?

353
00:14:24,982 --> 00:14:25,982
Think so.

354
00:14:27,775 --> 00:14:29,261
Phone numbers. Good.

355
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:32,216
Call 'em in. See if you can get
some names to go with those numbers.

356
00:14:32,217 --> 00:14:34,592
Hey, Vic. Found this under the bed.

357
00:14:35,157 --> 00:14:36,654
Guy must have need a boost for the road.

358
00:14:36,655 --> 00:14:38,155
Or daddy's little girl did.

359
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:45,448
They came and got me one
night about a week ago.

360
00:14:45,838 --> 00:14:46,951
Took me to this safe house

361
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:48,246
'cause they told me I was in danger.

362
00:14:48,401 --> 00:14:49,534
From Salseda?

363
00:14:49,874 --> 00:14:51,374
I just want to find Guardo.

364
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,597
Could you look for him? Please?

365
00:14:53,687 --> 00:14:55,189
He's supposed to be in Mexico, isn't he?

366
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:57,836
The main one said that Salseda
would try to kidnap me

367
00:14:57,837 --> 00:14:59,194
to get leverage on Guardo.

368
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,906
And then they'd just, what, let you go?

369
00:15:02,537 --> 00:15:05,766
This one? He said that Guardo
never came back to L.A.,

370
00:15:05,862 --> 00:15:08,584
that they caught Salseda.
Then he dropped me off.

371
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,380
They know what happened to Guardo.

372
00:15:11,741 --> 00:15:13,518
They know if someone killed him.

373
00:15:19,181 --> 00:15:22,514
Her time frame puts all this
during Vic's personal days off.

374
00:15:22,868 --> 00:15:24,364
I understand the time frame.

375
00:15:24,365 --> 00:15:26,976
Vic had Guardo on the phone.
Nydia confirms it.

376
00:15:27,401 --> 00:15:30,178
And there's no Salseda
in the department's records

377
00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:32,837
with any connection with the
salvadorans or the cartel.

378
00:15:32,838 --> 00:15:36,298
We are not gonna accuse Mackey
of murder and be wrong again.

379
00:15:38,152 --> 00:15:39,839
Let me put Vic in the room with her.

380
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,451
I'll set it up as a surprise,

381
00:15:41,465 --> 00:15:42,464
but I'll let the camera roll.

382
00:15:42,465 --> 00:15:44,353
You shook that hornet's nest once.

383
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:45,713
Haven't you been stung enough yet?

384
00:15:45,714 --> 00:15:47,340
It's not an accusation,
and if the girl's lying,

385
00:15:47,341 --> 00:15:48,341
what's the harm?

386
00:15:51,715 --> 00:15:52,715
Keep it contained.

387
00:15:53,029 --> 00:15:54,973
Good. I'll keep Billings out of it.

388
00:15:56,493 --> 00:15:58,560
Rahid Moore. How do we find him?

389
00:15:58,561 --> 00:16:00,124
I don't know anyone by that name.

390
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,039
That's right. You're the
P.T.A. mom from eagle rock.

391
00:16:03,912 --> 00:16:05,213
Husband, two kids.

392
00:16:06,126 --> 00:16:07,188
Weird we found your number

393
00:16:07,189 --> 00:16:10,189
in Rahid's apartment
on the shity side of the freeway.

394
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:12,325
The guy with two distribution arrests.

395
00:16:12,455 --> 00:16:14,015
Had three stars by your name.

396
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:15,938
Your husband know you're on the spike?

397
00:16:15,939 --> 00:16:18,105
I don't know what you're talking about.

398
00:16:19,502 --> 00:16:21,420
- Bitch to hide, ain't it?
- Hey!

399
00:16:22,313 --> 00:16:24,627
Got to work real hard
to hide that secret.

400
00:16:24,628 --> 00:16:25,628
Stop!

401
00:16:25,753 --> 00:16:26,753
Let me see.

402
00:16:28,128 --> 00:16:29,689
Where you shoot up, on your ankle?

403
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,529
- Between the toes?
- Get off me!

404
00:16:31,689 --> 00:16:33,244
Tell me where to find Rahid.

405
00:16:42,628 --> 00:16:43,628
Stop.

406
00:16:52,565 --> 00:16:54,176
I'm getting to the good part.

407
00:17:01,628 --> 00:17:04,182
Whew. Nice scab marks.

408
00:17:05,003 --> 00:17:06,058
Your husband knows.

409
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:08,130
Otherwise, you're one frustrated gal

410
00:17:08,256 --> 00:17:10,314
when it comes to
the oral pleasures of life.

411
00:17:10,315 --> 00:17:11,254
Stop it.

412
00:17:11,255 --> 00:17:13,088
Then tell me what I need to know.

413
00:17:14,024 --> 00:17:15,139
Don't tell Jeffrey?

414
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,591
I'm gonna tell him,
your kids, your friends.

415
00:17:17,683 --> 00:17:19,209
I'm even gonna tell the little old lady

416
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:21,598
who brings the cookies
to the P.T.A. meetings.

417
00:17:30,287 --> 00:17:31,842
Sure is getting hot in here.

418
00:17:32,646 --> 00:17:35,252
OK. Hey, hey. This stops now,
you understand?

419
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,347
What?

420
00:17:36,348 --> 00:17:38,529
This Tina bullshit.
This isn't high school.

421
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:39,404
You know, that's too bad,

422
00:17:39,405 --> 00:17:42,028
because I heard she was gonna ask
you to the sadie hawkins dance.

423
00:17:42,029 --> 00:17:44,362
Hey, how's the quick
meter business going?

424
00:17:45,843 --> 00:17:47,279
The machines are still here,

425
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,724
which means you're still
lining your pocket

426
00:17:48,718 --> 00:17:49,901
on the department's dime, right?

427
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,647
I've been waiting for you
to throw it in my face.

428
00:17:51,648 --> 00:17:52,607
I'm gonna do more than that.

429
00:17:52,608 --> 00:17:54,217
I'm gonna throw it in I.A.D.'s face.

430
00:17:54,218 --> 00:17:56,242
Why, 'cause I gave you
a little jab about Tina?

431
00:17:56,243 --> 00:17:57,172
Yes.

432
00:17:58,218 --> 00:17:59,606
But I'll make you a deal.

433
00:17:59,905 --> 00:18:01,716
You get those machines
out of here today,

434
00:18:01,717 --> 00:18:04,777
you back off the Tina
and me thing forever,

435
00:18:05,156 --> 00:18:06,780
and I'll pretend it never happened.

436
00:18:06,781 --> 00:18:10,155
Remember that real partner vibe
we had going catching the runway rapist?

437
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:12,092
That had a shelf life
of about what, 48 hours?

438
00:18:12,093 --> 00:18:13,632
- What's I.A.D.'s number again?
- All right.

439
00:18:13,781 --> 00:18:14,788
All right.

440
00:18:15,032 --> 00:18:16,920
But this is gonna take some doing.

441
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:20,943
Now I have to cover my ass
for the rest of the day.

442
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:28,798
You guys ever think about
putting some doors in here?

443
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,910
You're in charge. See what you can do.

444
00:18:33,486 --> 00:18:34,110
What now?

445
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:37,446
He texts me back with
a number and a time.

446
00:18:37,735 --> 00:18:39,901
Each number means
a different location.

447
00:18:39,924 --> 00:18:41,424
How long before he answers?

448
00:18:41,941 --> 00:18:43,486
It depends on when he can meet.

449
00:18:43,487 --> 00:18:44,709
And your P.T.A. schedule.

450
00:18:51,645 --> 00:18:53,423
I just don't understand
where this is supposed to go.

451
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:54,971
All the numbers
are right there in the file.

452
00:18:54,972 --> 00:18:57,035
Just look it up. Hey, Kevin.

453
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:58,236
Hi, Danny.

454
00:19:00,983 --> 00:19:02,094
This is Tina Hanlon.

455
00:19:02,859 --> 00:19:04,670
- Poster girl, right?
- Yes.

456
00:19:04,734 --> 00:19:06,316
Yeah. I'm Kevin Hiatt.

457
00:19:06,733 --> 00:19:08,010
Nice to meet you. Tina.

458
00:19:08,609 --> 00:19:09,609
Nice to meet you.

459
00:19:14,422 --> 00:19:16,168
Tina, did you finish that filing yet?

460
00:19:16,172 --> 00:19:18,227
It's a three week job.
What do you think?

461
00:19:21,735 --> 00:19:23,290
You know, I'm your superior.

462
00:19:23,545 --> 00:19:25,296
When you talk to me, lose the tone.

463
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:28,908
You thought it was tough with Julian,
you ain't seen nothing yet.

464
00:19:28,936 --> 00:19:31,373
You've got to find a way
to be better than you were.

465
00:19:31,374 --> 00:19:33,998
Otherwise, you're gonna end up
being our permanent filing girl.

466
00:19:33,999 --> 00:19:36,876
When I was gone, I met a few
people in some high places,

467
00:19:37,619 --> 00:19:40,201
so I'm not exactly knocked
over by the new stripes.

468
00:19:40,437 --> 00:19:42,123
I'm not a trainee here anymore.

469
00:19:42,124 --> 00:19:44,235
I'll watch my tongue, but so will you.

470
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:45,247
Or what?

471
00:19:45,248 --> 00:19:46,248
Or you'll have to explain

472
00:19:46,249 --> 00:19:49,582
why you can't get along
with the new face of the department.

473
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:56,750
Hey, sweetheart.

474
00:19:58,504 --> 00:19:59,637
Everything ok, kiddo?

475
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,501
Hey.

476
00:20:05,439 --> 00:20:07,272
You know what?
Let's go upstairs.

477
00:20:12,734 --> 00:20:14,567
All right, Cass.
What's going on?

478
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:16,914
I don't have to talk to him.

479
00:20:20,049 --> 00:20:21,235
Look, you're causing your mom

480
00:20:21,236 --> 00:20:22,902
a lot of stress here, sweetie.

481
00:20:23,049 --> 00:20:24,840
Mattie and Megan have
a beautiful weekend planned

482
00:20:24,841 --> 00:20:25,944
with a bunch of kids just like...

483
00:20:25,945 --> 00:20:28,395
I could stay with Falovia.
Her parents said it's fine.

484
00:20:28,396 --> 00:20:29,610
Hey, you're staying with me.

485
00:20:29,611 --> 00:20:30,611
Or not.

486
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,991
Let's talk about what's bothering you.

487
00:20:36,631 --> 00:20:37,631
Fine.

488
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,633
My friend Brian, his dad's a lawyer,

489
00:20:41,187 --> 00:20:42,964
did a "Lexis/Exis" search on you.

490
00:20:42,999 --> 00:20:44,721
I saw all the shit you've done.

491
00:20:44,936 --> 00:20:45,811
What?

492
00:20:45,812 --> 00:20:47,123
The brutality complaints.

493
00:20:47,124 --> 00:20:49,235
The I.A.D. guy thought
you killed people.

494
00:20:49,312 --> 00:20:49,999
Oh, Cassidy.

495
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,560
Listen to me.

496
00:20:50,561 --> 00:20:52,435
People say things and write things.

497
00:20:52,436 --> 00:20:54,491
That does mean that they're true, ok?

498
00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:57,575
That I.A.D. cop got caught
trying to frame your father.

499
00:20:57,749 --> 00:20:59,137
He's the one in jail now.

500
00:21:00,187 --> 00:21:02,312
I don't want to learn
about life from you.

501
00:21:02,313 --> 00:21:03,562
You have nothing to teach me.

502
00:21:03,563 --> 00:21:05,062
Hey, I'll teach you some respect.

503
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:06,140
Respect,

504
00:21:06,345 --> 00:21:07,403
is earned.

505
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,250
Cassidy...

506
00:21:11,564 --> 00:21:13,437
Whatever you've read,
whatever you've heard,

507
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,000
it's not the whole truth, honey.

508
00:21:15,001 --> 00:21:17,445
Like the baby you had
with some other woman?

509
00:21:23,751 --> 00:21:26,000
I heard mom taking on
the phone with grandma.

510
00:21:26,001 --> 00:21:27,556
She didn't know I was awake.

511
00:21:29,627 --> 00:21:30,627
Cassidy...

512
00:21:32,377 --> 00:21:33,742
That's adult stuff.

513
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:37,187
You don't have to concern
yourself with that right now.

514
00:21:37,188 --> 00:21:41,021
You kept a secret that I have
some baby brother i've never even seen?

515
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,564
Vic, Rahid answered the text message.

516
00:21:57,565 --> 00:21:58,565
We got a location.

517
00:21:58,754 --> 00:21:59,754
- Vic?
- What?

518
00:21:59,814 --> 00:22:02,626
Somebody upstairs say
they've got information on Guardo Lima.

519
00:22:02,627 --> 00:22:03,565
What kind of information?

520
00:22:03,566 --> 00:22:04,558
I had trouble following it.

521
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:05,784
You know that world better than I do.

522
00:22:05,785 --> 00:22:07,252
I'm buried. Can you talk to him?

523
00:22:07,253 --> 00:22:08,753
I'm kind of busy right now.

524
00:22:09,071 --> 00:22:11,113
Well, if it's about Lemansky's
murder, it could be important.

525
00:22:11,114 --> 00:22:12,638
Hey, Vic, let's go.

526
00:22:13,004 --> 00:22:14,938
I got a location on a murder suspect.

527
00:22:14,939 --> 00:22:18,439
If they're still around when I get back,
i'll chat 'em up then.

528
00:22:40,582 --> 00:22:43,461
Valerie couldn't make it,
but she sends her regards.

529
00:22:45,959 --> 00:22:48,726
You want to tell us why you ran out
of your apartment with 2 trash bags?

530
00:22:48,727 --> 00:22:49,963
Don't you dump your trash?

531
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,408
Not the day after pickup.

532
00:22:51,893 --> 00:22:53,458
That's when the bins is empty.

533
00:22:53,459 --> 00:22:56,417
Emily Martin. She was in
your apartment today.

534
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,456
Never heard of her.

535
00:22:58,457 --> 00:23:01,457
So when her blood comes back
off the bottom of your shoe,

536
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:03,019
you gonna tell us
you never stepped in it?

537
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,519
You stabbed her, then
you ran out and dumped the knife,

538
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,832
and Johnnie Cochran ain't
alive to represent you.

539
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:09,777
Do you know who this girl was, man?

540
00:23:10,298 --> 00:23:11,353
You mean her daddy?

541
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:11,859
Yeah.

542
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,526
Some big, important city dude.

543
00:23:13,738 --> 00:23:16,026
Vips get quick police response.

544
00:23:16,173 --> 00:23:17,922
Now, we're gonna hand over
his daughter's killer,

545
00:23:17,923 --> 00:23:20,423
and they're gonna make
an example out of you.

546
00:23:23,342 --> 00:23:25,119
I let her suck my dick. So what?

547
00:23:25,464 --> 00:23:27,465
That sure as hell
don't mean I killed her.

548
00:23:27,466 --> 00:23:29,338
Aside from your winning personality,

549
00:23:29,339 --> 00:23:31,963
is there any other reason why Emily
would want to play head games with you?

550
00:23:31,964 --> 00:23:33,575
She need fuel for the needle.

551
00:23:34,131 --> 00:23:36,091
Didn't have the money
to keep herself mellow,

552
00:23:36,092 --> 00:23:38,964
so she started paying another dude
with some mouth and pussy.

553
00:23:38,965 --> 00:23:39,965
What dude?

554
00:23:40,027 --> 00:23:43,838
Snail. He moved some shit
for me over in Brentwood.

555
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,965
I brought her around a couple times.

556
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,846
What can I say?
The girl was smart enough

557
00:23:47,847 --> 00:23:50,345
to cut out the middleman
and go directly to the source.

558
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:51,908
How did snail feel about that?

559
00:23:51,909 --> 00:23:53,464
White boy's a control freak.

560
00:23:53,784 --> 00:23:54,839
He got on the shit,

561
00:23:55,347 --> 00:23:57,013
then started rationing it out.

562
00:23:57,471 --> 00:23:59,409
Thought he could keep
the pussy on a leash.

563
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:00,687
You see him kill Emily?

564
00:24:01,846 --> 00:24:02,846
I heard something.

565
00:24:03,033 --> 00:24:05,699
By the time I got outside,
she was already done.

566
00:24:06,971 --> 00:24:09,221
And I knew y'all was gonna be
crawling all over the place,

567
00:24:09,222 --> 00:24:12,158
so I stuck my stash in the
trash and stepped outside.

568
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,659
Pat yourself on the back later.

569
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,971
Right now you're gonna tell us
where Snail is.

570
00:24:16,223 --> 00:24:17,189
Right?

571
00:24:18,597 --> 00:24:20,208
I'll tell you something else.

572
00:24:20,536 --> 00:24:21,536
That girl...

573
00:24:22,788 --> 00:24:24,399
She had no love for her pops.

574
00:24:26,722 --> 00:24:28,284
What's the latest
with the Martin murder?

575
00:24:28,285 --> 00:24:29,901
Getting to a dark place.

576
00:24:29,902 --> 00:24:30,570
Meaning?

577
00:24:30,571 --> 00:24:32,288
The daughter was
a heroin addicted whore.

578
00:24:32,289 --> 00:24:34,785
Paid for her drugs with
pussy and mouth favors.

579
00:24:34,786 --> 00:24:36,598
Other than that, she was
pippi longstocking.

580
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:38,154
That's a lot to get between.

581
00:24:38,973 --> 00:24:40,535
He's a friend
of the department's, but...

582
00:24:40,536 --> 00:24:41,847
But if this thing's uncontrollable,

583
00:24:41,848 --> 00:24:44,292
there's no sense in you
getting burned, too.

584
00:24:46,345 --> 00:24:47,680
We need to appear loyal.

585
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:51,348
But if the press gets ahold of the
information, that's out of our control.

586
00:24:51,349 --> 00:24:53,222
Martin can have somewhere
else to focus his anger.

587
00:24:53,223 --> 00:24:55,278
Someone's gotta take the heat, right?

588
00:24:57,349 --> 00:24:58,910
Anything I should know about?

589
00:24:58,911 --> 00:25:00,244
Nothing we can't handle.

590
00:25:01,286 --> 00:25:02,973
Don't let these people influence you.

591
00:25:02,974 --> 00:25:04,473
Follow the case where it leads.

592
00:25:04,474 --> 00:25:06,661
The VIP key's only
gonna open so many door.

593
00:25:06,662 --> 00:25:07,662
You got it?

594
00:25:09,475 --> 00:25:11,363
Now's the time to be taking notes.

595
00:25:12,037 --> 00:25:13,145
- Hey, Vic.
- Excuse me.

596
00:25:21,663 --> 00:25:24,413
Shane logged in 73 grenades
that night just like we rembered.

597
00:25:24,414 --> 00:25:25,412
You talked to the bomb squad?

598
00:25:25,413 --> 00:25:26,555
It seemed like a paperwork thing.

599
00:25:26,556 --> 00:25:28,418
Had a rookie count 'em all by hand.

600
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,578
73. All accounted for.

601
00:25:37,804 --> 00:25:40,375
Oh shit. You know I'm an asshole,

602
00:25:40,376 --> 00:25:43,756
first I doubt of Lem, now Shane.
I'm a complete asshole, man.

603
00:25:44,071 --> 00:25:46,765
No, we just wanted answers.

604
00:25:47,667 --> 00:25:49,111
This is a good one to get.

605
00:25:49,289 --> 00:25:50,400
Maybe Shane's right.

606
00:25:51,413 --> 00:25:53,968
Maybe we got all the
answers we're gonna have.

607
00:26:05,352 --> 00:26:07,030
Hey, Danny, got a minute?

608
00:26:08,165 --> 00:26:09,165
Of course.

609
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,235
What's up?

610
00:26:20,777 --> 00:26:22,332
My daughter knows about Lee.

611
00:26:22,464 --> 00:26:23,464
Oh, Jesus.

612
00:26:23,852 --> 00:26:24,855
How?

613
00:26:25,922 --> 00:26:28,088
She heard Corrine talking on the phone.

614
00:26:28,296 --> 00:26:30,573
Look, no offense,
but she may be your ex,

615
00:26:30,649 --> 00:26:33,037
but that lady's been
a real pain in my ass.

616
00:26:33,774 --> 00:26:36,996
Now, look, Vic, I chose
to do this alone for a reason, ok?

617
00:26:37,213 --> 00:26:38,961
I don't need a hassle around here.

618
00:26:38,962 --> 00:26:41,795
This isn't people in the barn.
This is my daughter.

619
00:26:41,899 --> 00:26:44,510
Yeah, well, I never wanted you
to get involved.

620
00:26:44,726 --> 00:26:47,461
Not you, not your ex,
not your kids.

621
00:26:47,569 --> 00:26:51,767
I've learned as a parent
that things don't go as we planned.

622
00:26:52,899 --> 00:26:53,899
Do they?

623
00:26:57,401 --> 00:26:58,401
So now what?

624
00:27:07,277 --> 00:27:08,273
Vic and I got the front.

625
00:27:08,274 --> 00:27:10,385
You guys come in
from around the back.

626
00:27:11,275 --> 00:27:12,275
Ok, let's go.

627
00:27:32,563 --> 00:27:33,862
Wait. Wait, wait!

628
00:27:35,188 --> 00:27:36,188
What?

629
00:27:37,688 --> 00:27:38,688
Shit!

630
00:27:38,939 --> 00:27:39,939
That's a .45.

631
00:27:40,565 --> 00:27:42,731
These vests aren't
gonna be worth shit.

632
00:27:44,813 --> 00:27:45,813
Hit it!

633
00:27:53,437 --> 00:27:54,437
Go!

634
00:28:29,848 --> 00:28:30,848
Get down!

635
00:28:31,723 --> 00:28:32,723
Hiatt, I got him!

636
00:28:33,034 --> 00:28:34,034
Don't move!

637
00:28:34,473 --> 00:28:35,472
Are you hit?

638
00:28:35,473 --> 00:28:36,473
No.

639
00:28:37,224 --> 00:28:38,829
I'm not hit.
Bitch!

640
00:28:40,849 --> 00:28:42,348
I'm taking this guy in alone.

641
00:28:42,349 --> 00:28:42,846
What?

642
00:28:42,847 --> 00:28:43,783
You know the situation.

643
00:28:43,784 --> 00:28:45,846
There's no way you can
walk away from it clean.

644
00:28:45,847 --> 00:28:46,847
So screw.

645
00:28:47,223 --> 00:28:49,099
What the hell's the city controller
even do, anyway?

646
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,223
Eliminates the Strike Team
with the stroke of a pen.

647
00:28:51,224 --> 00:28:53,098
This guy took shots
at both you and Hiatt.

648
00:28:53,099 --> 00:28:54,955
Shane's right.
We can't walk the guy into the cage

649
00:28:54,956 --> 00:28:57,091
who took shots at cops
without messing up his hair some.

650
00:28:57,092 --> 00:28:58,180
It sends a bad message.

651
00:28:58,181 --> 00:28:59,779
Martin's a friend of the department.

652
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:02,155
That means more money, more cops,
so we have to consider it.

653
00:29:02,156 --> 00:29:04,154
Look, the Captain said
we didn't have to worry about that.

654
00:29:04,155 --> 00:29:05,404
She doesn't have all the pieces.

655
00:29:05,405 --> 00:29:07,279
We got the suspect.
Let's just take this guy in.

656
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,265
That's what I'm gonna do.
I'm just doing it alone.

657
00:29:09,266 --> 00:29:10,872
No! I'm not comfortable with that.

658
00:29:10,873 --> 00:29:13,185
Look, we're gonna get
squeezed whatever we do.

659
00:29:13,186 --> 00:29:15,130
Maybe I can figure a way around it.

660
00:29:15,249 --> 00:29:16,915
But if not, I'll take the hit.

661
00:29:16,936 --> 00:29:17,999
For the rest of us? Why?

662
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,749
Because I'm out of here
at the end of the month.

663
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,687
There's nothing else they can do to me.

664
00:29:21,688 --> 00:29:23,061
Listen, maybe I should take him in.

665
00:29:23,062 --> 00:29:25,811
Look, you guys all have
something to lose.

666
00:29:25,812 --> 00:29:28,311
Now, maybe there's a
compromise to be worked out,

667
00:29:28,312 --> 00:29:30,923
but you guys aren't the
ones to be compromised.

668
00:29:34,126 --> 00:29:35,436
He needs to show up back at the barn

669
00:29:35,437 --> 00:29:37,061
looking the same way he looks now.

670
00:29:37,062 --> 00:29:39,284
Won't mess up a hair on his little head.

671
00:29:46,188 --> 00:29:48,563
You brought the knife.
You followed the girl.

672
00:29:48,564 --> 00:29:50,291
Death penalty's a slam dunk.

673
00:29:50,938 --> 00:29:53,001
I can make it so
you could avoid all that.

674
00:29:53,002 --> 00:29:54,811
Maybe even see the light of day again.

675
00:29:54,812 --> 00:29:56,251
What are you talking about?

676
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:57,974
You know who Emily's father is?

677
00:29:59,189 --> 00:30:01,744
Well, the family wants
to avoid embarrassment.

678
00:30:01,939 --> 00:30:04,716
You just gotta be willing
to tell the right story.

679
00:30:05,813 --> 00:30:07,424
Yeah? What's the right story?

680
00:30:09,183 --> 00:30:10,056
Good boy.

681
00:30:11,753 --> 00:30:14,217
Detroit, bring him up to interrogation.

682
00:30:21,377 --> 00:30:23,813
How'd you like to walk out
of here with no charges?

683
00:30:23,814 --> 00:30:25,147
I'd like that very much.

684
00:30:25,191 --> 00:30:26,913
Step around. I'll tell you how.

685
00:30:31,128 --> 00:30:32,128
Hey, you're back.

686
00:30:32,753 --> 00:30:34,252
Any word on the lab results?

687
00:30:34,253 --> 00:30:36,438
They promised me by
the end of business day.

688
00:30:36,439 --> 00:30:37,994
Uh, that woman's still here.

689
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,314
What woman?

690
00:30:39,315 --> 00:30:40,940
The one with information on Guardo Lima.

691
00:30:40,941 --> 00:30:41,939
Oh, right.

692
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,854
She's stuck around this long.

693
00:30:44,764 --> 00:30:46,677
Uh... Yeah. Ok.

694
00:30:46,789 --> 00:30:48,636
Thanks. She's in interrogation one.

695
00:30:48,766 --> 00:30:49,769
Got it.

696
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:01,674
Guardo never came back.

697
00:31:03,234 --> 00:31:04,888
<i>Guardo's a mysterious guy.</i>

698
00:31:08,789 --> 00:31:10,405
Did you do something to him?

699
00:31:10,941 --> 00:31:12,107
I never even saw him.

700
00:31:13,798 --> 00:31:15,186
What happened to Salseda?

701
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,582
He must have got away.

702
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,298
I heard from people in Mexico.

703
00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:20,299
They said Guardo came back to L.A.

704
00:31:20,423 --> 00:31:23,256
I heard the same thing.
I only wish I'd caught him.

705
00:31:24,683 --> 00:31:25,738
I don't understand.

706
00:31:25,808 --> 00:31:28,432
We heard a rumor that
Salseda wanted to kill Guardo.

707
00:31:28,433 --> 00:31:30,015
We didn't know if it was true but,

708
00:31:30,647 --> 00:31:33,426
Guardo was a suspect in the murder
of a cop, so I didn't give a shit.

709
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:36,554
So you lied to me?
You kept me prisoner?

710
00:31:36,621 --> 00:31:40,526
<i>No. I told you you could
leave whenever you wanted.</i>

711
00:31:40,684 --> 00:31:42,239
The smart thing was to stay.

712
00:31:43,721 --> 00:31:46,683
All the stuff Guardo did,
it's only a matter of time.

713
00:31:46,684 --> 00:31:49,239
You're lucky he didn't
drag you down with him.

714
00:31:57,684 --> 00:31:59,434
Why don't we just get
Kavanaugh out of jail?

715
00:31:59,435 --> 00:32:00,746
Have me investigated again?

716
00:32:00,747 --> 00:32:04,111
Witness protection?
Sounds more like kidnapping to me.

717
00:32:07,531 --> 00:32:08,776
All right,
I wanted Guardo.

718
00:32:10,949 --> 00:32:13,310
I heard about Salseda on the street,
so I used it.

719
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,563
I would have used
anything I had to get him,

720
00:32:15,564 --> 00:32:16,937
to bring him in for Lem's death.

721
00:32:16,938 --> 00:32:18,750
But the mexicans got to him first.

722
00:32:18,751 --> 00:32:20,639
You did all this based on a rumor?

723
00:32:20,815 --> 00:32:21,815
Yeah, I did.

724
00:32:22,126 --> 00:32:25,500
If I had ignored that rumor
and Nydia had got killed by that guy,

725
00:32:25,501 --> 00:32:28,252
you'd be asking me a lot
tougher questions right now.

726
00:32:28,253 --> 00:32:29,813
So you never found Guardo?

727
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:32,205
- No, I...
- She seems convinced you did.

728
00:32:32,505 --> 00:32:34,440
For all we know,
Guardo could have sent her here

729
00:32:34,441 --> 00:32:37,996
to make us think that he's dead,
just to throw us off his track.

730
00:32:38,128 --> 00:32:39,239
Oh, for Christ sake.

731
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:42,628
She's in love with a guy
who blows up kids for a living.

732
00:32:42,629 --> 00:32:44,878
You're trying to show people
why you should stay.

733
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:48,101
This escapade looks like
another reason why you should go.

734
00:32:51,065 --> 00:32:52,953
Guardo was killed by the mexicans.

735
00:32:53,627 --> 00:32:55,564
You don't believe me, talk to Hernan.

736
00:32:55,565 --> 00:32:57,676
Tell me how to contact him and I will.

737
00:32:58,503 --> 00:33:00,939
I'll close the books on the
girlfriend's false accusations.

738
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:01,940
Ask Hiatt.

739
00:33:18,516 --> 00:33:20,515
You caught the man that killed Emily?

740
00:33:20,516 --> 00:33:21,516
Yeah.

741
00:33:23,765 --> 00:33:27,042
I think you know what your
daughter was into when she died.

742
00:33:27,206 --> 00:33:28,206
She was an addict.

743
00:33:29,515 --> 00:33:33,015
I tried to help her, but
she wouldn't take it so I cut her off.

744
00:33:33,706 --> 00:33:35,330
I thought it would keep her
from buying more.

745
00:33:35,331 --> 00:33:38,553
Do you know what your daughter
was doing to get her drugs?

746
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,420
She threw it in my face,

747
00:33:40,766 --> 00:33:42,599
trying to get more money from me.

748
00:33:43,003 --> 00:33:44,365
Well, it was all true.

749
00:33:45,975 --> 00:33:48,495
But that's not how history has to read.

750
00:33:51,641 --> 00:33:52,641
Thank you.

751
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,468
I mean, there are some
things I can't fake.

752
00:33:55,581 --> 00:33:58,015
The M.E.'s gonna find
that heroin in her system.

753
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,293
I'll take care of that.

754
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:07,052
I've got an appeals hearing
in a couple of weeks.

755
00:34:07,209 --> 00:34:10,121
They're going to decide
whether to force me out or not.

756
00:34:10,232 --> 00:34:11,879
Well, I'll see what I can do.

757
00:34:18,406 --> 00:34:19,853
Must be good to be king.

758
00:34:24,394 --> 00:34:25,949
Snail dealt for me a little.

759
00:34:26,333 --> 00:34:27,666
He was in over his head.

760
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:29,394
Told me about this girl

761
00:34:29,395 --> 00:34:31,783
that was trying to
get him out of the life.

762
00:34:32,123 --> 00:34:33,207
Shame.

763
00:34:33,834 --> 00:34:36,334
<i>Just trying to get him
to stop selling drugs.</i>

764
00:34:38,334 --> 00:34:40,056
<i>Guess she was a real nice girl.</i>

765
00:34:41,833 --> 00:34:44,777
Emily found out I was dealing,
she wanted me to quit.

766
00:34:45,157 --> 00:34:46,870
She followed me up to Rahid's apartment,

767
00:34:46,871 --> 00:34:48,537
trying to stop me from buying.

768
00:34:49,373 --> 00:34:51,484
Kept pressing me hard in the elevator.

769
00:34:52,498 --> 00:34:53,498
I just lost it.

770
00:34:54,131 --> 00:34:55,734
<i>She didn't deserve any of it.</i>

771
00:35:01,747 --> 00:35:02,802
What's the problem?

772
00:35:03,177 --> 00:35:04,867
We shouldn't be playing God.

773
00:35:04,979 --> 00:35:06,442
God creates all men equal.

774
00:35:06,499 --> 00:35:07,622
Once they get out of the womb,

775
00:35:07,623 --> 00:35:09,178
he starts playing favorites.

776
00:35:16,276 --> 00:35:17,886
Is that Lem's
lab report?

777
00:35:18,563 --> 00:35:19,311
Is it?

778
00:35:19,312 --> 00:35:21,256
Yeah, and the final autopsy report.

779
00:35:21,437 --> 00:35:22,437
And?

780
00:35:22,497 --> 00:35:25,274
Nothing much. No fingerprints.
No DNA left behind.

781
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,484
Well, let me see it.

782
00:35:28,625 --> 00:35:29,560
You think there's anyone

783
00:35:29,561 --> 00:35:32,061
who wants to solve Lem's murder
more than me?

784
00:35:32,499 --> 00:35:35,054
There's crime scene photos
and autopsy photos.

785
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:38,012
Curtis was eviscerated
from the waist down.

786
00:35:38,064 --> 00:35:39,064
Give me it.

787
00:35:52,019 --> 00:35:53,803
What report is this?
This is new.

788
00:35:53,959 --> 00:35:55,913
That's Kavanaugh's last report.

789
00:35:56,222 --> 00:35:58,062
Part of the deal he made
when he came clean about you

790
00:35:58,063 --> 00:35:59,729
was providing full disclosure.

791
00:36:14,877 --> 00:36:16,499
Hey, Kev, can I ask you something?

792
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,500
Absolutely.

793
00:36:19,063 --> 00:36:19,750
Hey.

794
00:36:19,751 --> 00:36:20,751
Hey.

795
00:36:21,566 --> 00:36:22,566
Hey, Dutch.

796
00:36:23,953 --> 00:36:26,071
Hey, Tina. That project I gave you,

797
00:36:26,072 --> 00:36:27,377
you made a couple mistakes.

798
00:36:27,378 --> 00:36:29,489
Come on. I'll show you before I leave.

799
00:36:30,613 --> 00:36:31,655
- Thanks.
- Sure.

800
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:32,814
- See ya.
- Bye.

801
00:36:36,449 --> 00:36:38,214
Did you ever ask me about Hernan,

802
00:36:38,314 --> 00:36:41,687
that I.C.E. agent in the
salvadoran organization?

803
00:36:41,688 --> 00:36:42,319
Sure.

804
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,776
Did you guys get in touch with him?

805
00:36:43,777 --> 00:36:44,835
- Yeah.
- How?

806
00:36:44,836 --> 00:36:45,876
It's easier to negotiate

807
00:36:45,877 --> 00:36:47,101
between Federal Agencies.

808
00:36:47,102 --> 00:36:49,126
But, you're not a Federal Agent anymore.

809
00:36:49,127 --> 00:36:50,761
No. No, not anymore.

810
00:36:53,046 --> 00:36:56,315
Careful with that.
It's a sophisticated piece of machinery.

811
00:36:56,316 --> 00:36:58,099
I don't want to see any dings in it.

812
00:36:59,139 --> 00:37:00,559
I gave it some thought.

813
00:37:00,867 --> 00:37:03,356
If you want to keep the machines,
go ahead.

814
00:37:03,579 --> 00:37:05,671
Why, so you'll still have it
to hand over my head?

815
00:37:05,672 --> 00:37:06,767
Yeah, that's right.

816
00:37:06,768 --> 00:37:08,132
No, thanks. I'll pass.

817
00:37:08,197 --> 00:37:10,463
I can keep the leverage
or you can lose the money.

818
00:37:10,464 --> 00:37:11,671
It's your call.

819
00:37:14,407 --> 00:37:15,407
Hey, guys?

820
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:17,033
Hang on a second.

821
00:37:29,563 --> 00:37:31,662
Hey, Cassidy. Come on in.

822
00:37:37,136 --> 00:37:38,472
This is Lee.

823
00:37:45,462 --> 00:37:46,688
What's his whole name?

824
00:37:46,689 --> 00:37:48,006
Lee carson sofer.

825
00:37:48,452 --> 00:37:50,263
Carson's my mom's maiden name.

826
00:37:52,989 --> 00:37:54,232
What's his birthday?

827
00:37:54,698 --> 00:37:57,856
On the second. 6:19 A.M.

828
00:38:05,844 --> 00:38:07,328
Do you want to hold him?

829
00:38:09,262 --> 00:38:10,936
Everything
all right, Cass?

830
00:38:13,981 --> 00:38:16,601
No, I... I don't want to hold him.

831
00:38:17,811 --> 00:38:18,866
I just want to see.

832
00:38:22,809 --> 00:38:23,809
That's ok.

833
00:38:25,308 --> 00:38:26,308
Another time.

834
00:38:31,124 --> 00:38:31,684
Hey.

835
00:38:31,888 --> 00:38:32,685
Hey.

836
00:38:33,597 --> 00:38:35,351
Vic wants the three of us to meet.

837
00:38:35,435 --> 00:38:36,435
When?

838
00:38:36,436 --> 00:38:37,436
Right now.

839
00:38:37,936 --> 00:38:38,991
Portillo Auto Body.

840
00:38:39,622 --> 00:38:41,184
He wants to walk Lem's crime scene

841
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:43,129
the time of night that it happened.

842
00:38:43,309 --> 00:38:44,787
See if there's anything
the lab boys missed.

843
00:38:44,788 --> 00:38:46,116
Lab report came in?

844
00:38:46,372 --> 00:38:47,321
Yeah.

845
00:38:47,377 --> 00:38:48,496
Anything useful?

846
00:38:49,364 --> 00:38:50,498
I don't think so.

847
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:53,637
You wanna ride together?

848
00:38:53,705 --> 00:38:56,372
I got to finish this paperwork
on our stabbing.

849
00:38:56,373 --> 00:38:57,747
I'll be five minutes behind you.

850
00:38:57,748 --> 00:38:59,627
Cool. I'll, uh...

851
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,437
See you there.

852
00:39:01,503 --> 00:39:02,414
Ok.

853
00:39:20,927 --> 00:39:21,763
Vic: <i>Yeah?</i>

854
00:39:22,468 --> 00:39:23,564
He's on his way.

855
00:39:23,999 --> 00:39:24,660
Good.

856
00:39:24,661 --> 00:39:26,372
<i>You sure you don't want me to be there?</i>

857
00:39:26,373 --> 00:39:28,724
No. Keep your distance.

858
00:39:29,435 --> 00:39:30,435
Ok.

859
00:40:05,076 --> 00:40:05,689
Hey.

860
00:40:08,376 --> 00:40:09,814
Wanna wait for Ronnie or what?

861
00:40:09,815 --> 00:40:11,092
No. We can get started.

862
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:12,690
Ok.

863
00:40:15,877 --> 00:40:16,877
Read the report.

864
00:40:17,317 --> 00:40:18,768
Yeah? What'd it say?

865
00:40:18,938 --> 00:40:19,938
Nothing new.

866
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,446
No prints.
No forensics.

867
00:40:24,007 --> 00:40:25,190
Guardo was smart.

868
00:40:26,125 --> 00:40:26,938
He was careful.

869
00:40:26,939 --> 00:40:28,716
Not careful enough to escape us.

870
00:40:30,174 --> 00:40:31,376
No, not that.

871
00:40:33,817 --> 00:40:35,094
Guardo didn't kill Lem.

872
00:40:37,749 --> 00:40:42,727
I tortured him, shot him, and burned
his body, and he didn't kill Lem.

873
00:40:44,752 --> 00:40:46,363
We were right there with you.

874
00:40:46,641 --> 00:40:47,751
Yeah.

875
00:40:48,502 --> 00:40:49,502
I know.

876
00:40:51,754 --> 00:40:53,087
But Guardo didn't do it.

877
00:40:54,503 --> 00:40:57,818
Salvadorans, they wanted
to stay off our radar.

878
00:40:57,948 --> 00:41:01,143
They didn't even kill Emolia
when they found out that she'd snitched.

879
00:41:01,144 --> 00:41:03,131
Well, maybe some
salvadoran rogue banger...

880
00:41:03,132 --> 00:41:05,316
What, who killed Lem with a grenade,

881
00:41:05,567 --> 00:41:07,922
let no trace, and
disappeared like a ghost?

882
00:41:08,034 --> 00:41:09,255
I don't think so.

883
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,571
It wasn't 1-9ers
looking for Antwon revenge.

884
00:41:14,219 --> 00:41:17,552
Made a fool of myself up
at Lompoc finding that one out.

885
00:41:26,128 --> 00:41:27,357
So I asked Ronnie

886
00:41:28,003 --> 00:41:31,503
to check if you logged all the grenades
that night at the bust.

887
00:41:33,626 --> 00:41:35,316
He counted 73 at the house,

888
00:41:35,911 --> 00:41:37,961
and there are 73 sitting there in the,

889
00:41:38,983 --> 00:41:41,073
bomb squad evidence locker right now.

890
00:41:45,505 --> 00:41:46,505
Which means...

891
00:41:49,505 --> 00:41:50,727
You pocketed a grenade

892
00:41:51,819 --> 00:41:54,930
before Aceveda even lied to us
about Lem ratting us out?

893
00:41:55,063 --> 00:41:59,301
You lied to us at the bust
about the count, you...

894
00:42:00,381 --> 00:42:03,351
Before I even started
to question Lem,

895
00:42:03,352 --> 00:42:05,153
you were looking
for a way to shut him up

896
00:42:05,264 --> 00:42:06,806
to make it look salvadoran?

897
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,716
Don't even go there, man.

898
00:42:07,717 --> 00:42:10,283
You were the last one
to get to the meet.

899
00:42:10,497 --> 00:42:11,819
You couldn't lose your tail, right?

900
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,413
- That's right.
- Well, did you try?

901
00:42:13,414 --> 00:42:14,361
As much as I could.

902
00:42:14,546 --> 00:42:16,404
I couldn't look too suspicious,
remember?

903
00:42:19,445 --> 00:42:21,167
Kavanaugh wrote another report.

904
00:42:22,318 --> 00:42:23,318
Part of his deal.

905
00:42:24,446 --> 00:42:26,168
He was short-handed that night.

906
00:42:26,757 --> 00:42:28,257
Just him and one other guy.

907
00:42:28,536 --> 00:42:30,105
Stop right there, Vic.

908
00:42:31,884 --> 00:42:33,416
There's nothing good
in where you're going...

909
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:35,459
Just him and one other guy.

910
00:42:36,132 --> 00:42:38,412
So he followed me and Ronnie.

911
00:42:44,572 --> 00:42:45,683
So what? What did...

912
00:42:47,258 --> 00:42:48,513
You dropped a grenade in his lap?

913
00:42:48,514 --> 00:42:50,078
What did you do, just run?

914
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,736
I did what I thought
had to be done at the time.

915
00:42:59,399 --> 00:43:00,399
Oh, God.

916
00:43:03,772 --> 00:43:04,772
I know, man.

917
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:06,085
Oh, God.

918
00:43:06,271 --> 00:43:06,884
I know.

919
00:43:06,976 --> 00:43:08,295
- Oh...
- I know.

920
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:09,577
Oh...

921
00:43:13,441 --> 00:43:15,014
You piece of shit!

922
00:43:15,367 --> 00:43:17,151
You made that decision
on your own?

923
00:43:17,152 --> 00:43:18,650
He wouldn't go to Mexico.

924
00:43:18,651 --> 00:43:19,587
Oh!

925
00:43:19,588 --> 00:43:21,310
I told him about the goat farm.

926
00:43:21,584 --> 00:43:22,584
About the way out.

927
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:25,796
About the money that we
were going to send him.

928
00:43:25,944 --> 00:43:28,319
You said that if he wouldn't
take the ride to Mexico,

929
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,604
that we would know that he turned.

930
00:43:29,605 --> 00:43:31,573
- He didn't turn!
- I know that now.

931
00:43:31,574 --> 00:43:34,396
We said that we would look him
in the eye and we would have the truth.

932
00:43:34,397 --> 00:43:35,623
And he never turned on us.

933
00:43:35,624 --> 00:43:38,047
We couldn't afford to take that chance.

934
00:43:39,072 --> 00:43:41,072
You think this has been easy for me?

935
00:43:41,269 --> 00:43:42,716
Carrying all this alone?

936
00:43:42,811 --> 00:43:44,501
For you? Lem!

937
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,604
It was an impossible situation.

938
00:43:47,046 --> 00:43:49,319
At the time, it was either
him or the rest of us.

939
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:50,320
Bullshit!

940
00:43:51,042 --> 00:43:53,689
Look, I was protecting
you and ronnie from it.

941
00:43:55,332 --> 00:43:57,040
Look, if he would have gone to jail
like he wanted,

942
00:43:57,041 --> 00:43:58,816
he would have been
killed by Antwon

943
00:43:59,243 --> 00:44:01,380
or turned by Kavanaugh.
Man, you know that.

944
00:44:01,565 --> 00:44:02,636
I don't know that.

945
00:44:03,181 --> 00:44:04,384
He was strong.

946
00:44:06,196 --> 00:44:08,196
You killed him because you were scared.

947
00:44:08,197 --> 00:44:09,967
He was strong and you were a coward!

948
00:44:10,097 --> 00:44:13,812
I was being strong for all of us,
and I am not a coward.

949
00:44:13,948 --> 00:44:15,946
Yeah, you were.
You were when you sat by

950
00:44:15,947 --> 00:44:19,002
and watched me tear Guardo
apart for something you did.

951
00:44:19,072 --> 00:44:20,759
Jesus Christ, what did you turn me into?

952
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:21,911
He's an asshole murder.

953
00:44:21,912 --> 00:44:23,350
I'm not an executioner!

954
00:44:23,351 --> 00:44:25,032
Well, go tell that to Terry's family.

955
00:44:25,033 --> 00:44:26,199
That's different.

956
00:44:26,889 --> 00:44:28,822
That son of a bitch, he was a traitor.

957
00:44:28,823 --> 00:44:29,823
Lem was my friend.

958
00:44:30,009 --> 00:44:31,009
He was mine, too.

959
00:44:34,826 --> 00:44:37,198
Look, you think you're looking
at me through some window.

960
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:39,327
And all you're really doing
is looking in a mirror.

961
00:44:39,328 --> 00:44:41,233
You and I, we're nothing alike.

962
00:44:41,457 --> 00:44:42,256
I would never...

963
00:44:42,257 --> 00:44:44,355
Oh, you did. More than once.

964
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:47,755
So let's at least tell the truth now.

965
00:44:48,635 --> 00:44:49,635
Lem's gone.

966
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:53,281
I would have spared Lem.

967
00:44:54,885 --> 00:44:56,483
And I stepped up and put Lem down

968
00:44:56,484 --> 00:44:59,311
so you could go to bed
at night believing that.

969
00:45:08,174 --> 00:45:09,609
You didn't come to me.

970
00:45:10,137 --> 00:45:12,799
You didn't talk to me.
We didn't decide, and now it's too late.

971
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:13,949
There was no time.

972
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:15,634
I didn't know if Kavanaugh
was going to swoop down

973
00:45:15,635 --> 00:45:16,689
and pick us up at any second.

974
00:45:16,690 --> 00:45:19,151
If you weren't sure...
If you weren't sure,

975
00:45:19,382 --> 00:45:22,577
you should have taken that chance
that he was still with us.

976
00:45:22,578 --> 00:45:24,075
You owed him that chance!

977
00:45:24,076 --> 00:45:27,827
I had to kill my friend,
and you know why.

978
00:45:28,904 --> 00:45:30,506
Look, it's taken me a while,

979
00:45:31,932 --> 00:45:34,512
but you're gonna learn
how to accept it, man.

980
00:45:34,607 --> 00:45:35,978
I will never accept that!

981
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:37,649
I will never accept that!

982
00:45:38,887 --> 00:45:40,220
I'm not gonna fight you.

983
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:44,283
I'm not gonna fight you.

984
00:45:49,264 --> 00:45:51,041
Ronnie's not even coming, is he?

985
00:45:51,459 --> 00:45:53,246
What, you told him you were
gonna look me in the eye,

986
00:45:53,247 --> 00:45:56,054
find out the truth?
Are you so god damn psychic?

987
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:00,048
Why didn't you know
that Aceveda was lying about Lem, huh?

988
00:46:00,139 --> 00:46:01,416
I mean, all I was doing

989
00:46:01,763 --> 00:46:03,763
was following your game plan, coach.

990
00:46:04,888 --> 00:46:06,054
You killed my friend.

991
00:46:07,282 --> 00:46:10,229
Then you almost let
Kavanaugh send me away for it.

992
00:46:10,514 --> 00:46:12,012
I never would have let it come to that.

993
00:46:12,013 --> 00:46:13,235
You let me kill Guardo

994
00:46:13,639 --> 00:46:15,639
without opening your god damn mouth!

995
00:46:16,652 --> 00:46:19,012
I had the change to pull the
trigger on you once before.

996
00:46:19,013 --> 00:46:20,013
I didn't do it,

997
00:46:21,078 --> 00:46:22,648
and Lem lost his life because of it.

998
00:46:22,649 --> 00:46:24,237
Lem would have broken.

999
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:25,945
I took it on myself

1000
00:46:26,953 --> 00:46:29,453
the way that you took it off of us
for Terry.

1001
00:46:29,841 --> 00:46:32,230
Vic, you're gonna learn
to be ok with it.

1002
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:34,828
Man, you just need a little time.

1003
00:46:34,829 --> 00:46:36,717
You and me, we're all out of time.

1004
00:46:43,328 --> 00:46:44,485
Lem's case is still open.

1005
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:46,751
I hope they catch you.
I hope they do.

1006
00:46:47,204 --> 00:46:49,204
I hope everybody knows what you did.

1007
00:46:49,641 --> 00:46:51,974
You don't get to do
what you did for free.

1008
00:46:52,616 --> 00:46:53,898
You're gonna pay that bill.

1009
00:46:55,272 --> 00:46:58,189
What, you gonna give Dutch
a little push in my direction?

1010
00:46:59,747 --> 00:47:00,766
Well, maybe when they got me,

1011
00:47:00,767 --> 00:47:03,329
they'll have a little time to look
into who killed Terry.

1012
00:47:03,608 --> 00:47:06,330
That's old business,
and all you got is hearsay.

1013
00:47:06,331 --> 00:47:08,219
Our entire lives are hearsay, Vic.

1014
00:47:08,955 --> 00:47:10,288
All the shit we've done.

1015
00:47:11,418 --> 00:47:13,944
And I've got a hell of a lot more
on you than you've got on me.

1016
00:47:14,019 --> 00:47:15,871
Get in your truck. Drive away.

1017
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:17,827
Leave here before I kill you.

1018
00:47:17,942 --> 00:47:20,339
No, you won't.
We've already been through all that.

1019
00:47:20,561 --> 00:47:21,732
Before?

1020
00:47:22,029 --> 00:47:24,444
You didn't blow lem
in half with a grenade.

1021
00:47:26,194 --> 00:47:29,148
I see you again, I will kill you.

1022
00:47:39,634 --> 00:47:41,076
God damn hypocrite.
