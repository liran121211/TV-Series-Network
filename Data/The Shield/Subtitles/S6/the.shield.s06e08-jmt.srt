1
00:00:00,605 --> 00:00:02,030
<i>Previously on "The Shield"...</i>

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,277
My detective found 12 bodies
hacked to pieces.

3
00:00:04,377 --> 00:00:06,198
Machete's a weapon of choice
for the salvadorans.

4
00:00:06,298 --> 00:00:08,995
Which supports the tip that
Aceveda's cronies gave us

5
00:00:09,095 --> 00:00:12,484
that the killers were salvadorans.
The victims were all mexican illegals.

6
00:00:12,584 --> 00:00:14,689
Solving it quickly is the difference
between

7
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:16,994
keeping the Barn open or
closing it for good.

8
00:00:17,253 --> 00:00:19,326
Salvadoran bang has sponsored this fair.

9
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:22,048
This looks like retaliation for the
San Marcos house murders.

10
00:00:22,148 --> 00:00:25,414
- That's Hernan in the blue shirt.
- I.C.E. has an undercover operative

11
00:00:25,514 --> 00:00:28,566
high up in the salvadoran
food chain I need to protect.

12
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,822
There's an operative
inside the salvadorans

13
00:00:30,922 --> 00:00:32,640
who can help solve the
San Marcos house murders.

14
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,798
You know who the salvadorans were who
were swingin the machetes at San Marcos?

15
00:00:35,898 --> 00:00:38,019
It would mean death to
my cover if I started asking.

16
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:39,836
Salvadorans are closing ranks.

17
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:41,645
It's getting too dangerous
for you to be out there.

18
00:00:41,747 --> 00:00:43,717
- Where's Hernan?
- We lost contact with him.

19
00:00:43,817 --> 00:00:45,787
Anyway you guys could have
compromised his cover?

20
00:00:45,893 --> 00:00:47,844
- Did you talk to Shane?
- He killed Lem.

21
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:50,167
I did what I thought had to
be done at the time.

22
00:00:50,318 --> 00:00:52,724
I see you again, I will kill you.

23
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,602
Vic wanted to know how
Ben got a hold of cash

24
00:00:56,283 --> 00:00:58,954
Vendrell came by today.
He wanted the same information.

25
00:00:59,054 --> 00:01:01,119
We're not going to let you
get hurt over this.

26
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:03,382
- We got to get out of L.A.
- I'll squirrel enough away

27
00:01:03,482 --> 00:01:04,488
so we can get out of here.

28
00:01:04,588 --> 00:01:07,072
Just imagine every wrong
thing we have ever done.

29
00:01:07,172 --> 00:01:10,565
Anything happens to me,
or my wife, or my son...

30
00:01:12,028 --> 00:01:14,071
That lands on I.A.D.'s doorstep.

31
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:16,460
Tell Kesakian I got a
business proposition for him.

32
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,508
- I'm a cop. He's going to need to know.
- I'm an associate. Ellis Rezian.

33
00:01:19,608 --> 00:01:21,231
Man, I said I want to speak to Kesakian.

34
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,936
It's been a while since we had the good
relationship with law enforcement.

35
00:01:24,036 --> 00:01:25,300
That's funny, I'm a fixer.

36
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:28,078
- There's a new gas station on Tallmadge.
- The armenians,

37
00:01:28,376 --> 00:01:30,065
did they put you up to this?

38
00:01:30,206 --> 00:01:33,007
The supplier will be here tomorrow
to fill up all your tanks.

39
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:01,780
stay in, stay in.

40
00:02:25,966 --> 00:02:28,531
<i>Respiratory therapist, call C.C.U.</i>

41
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,441
<i>Respiratory therapist, call C.C.U.</i>

42
00:02:31,868 --> 00:02:33,260
Think you could...

43
00:02:45,273 --> 00:02:48,104
You stay strong, papa.

44
00:02:53,797 --> 00:02:56,003
You need to finish your english lessons.

45
00:03:01,167 --> 00:03:04,499
I can only stay for a few minutes
but I brought you this...

46
00:03:05,705 --> 00:03:09,945
To remind you of the colors
in the garden back in Revian.

47
00:03:39,504 --> 00:03:42,020
- Can I help you?
- I need to speak to Kesakian.

48
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,010
He's supposed to have an office here.

49
00:03:44,778 --> 00:03:46,092
He's not here.

50
00:03:46,233 --> 00:03:48,012
Look, I've squeezed every
food stamp collecting,

51
00:03:48,112 --> 00:03:50,257
benz driving armenian
from here to Glendale.

52
00:03:50,357 --> 00:03:51,940
Now, this is where he works out of

53
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,244
and I'm not leaving until I
get a little face time.

54
00:03:54,354 --> 00:03:56,685
Now, do we understand
each other, sweetie?

55
00:03:59,173 --> 00:04:00,582
This way, please.

56
00:04:09,869 --> 00:04:11,042
Take a seat.

57
00:04:16,758 --> 00:04:17,975
- I'm Kesakian.
- Look,

58
00:04:18,075 --> 00:04:19,570
I've got my nuts in a ringer right now

59
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:21,718
and I don't like it when people
crank the handle, ok?

60
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,002
I need to speak to the real Kesakian.

61
00:04:25,042 --> 00:04:27,373
My father's out of town,
but

62
00:04:27,663 --> 00:04:30,143
anything you need to discuss with him,
you can discus with me.

63
00:04:30,258 --> 00:04:31,904
- I'm handling his affairs.
- Well, then you pass this

64
00:04:32,004 --> 00:04:33,762
message along to pops, ok?

65
00:04:34,102 --> 00:04:36,241
I didn't sign up to be walked
into a murder jackpot,

66
00:04:36,341 --> 00:04:38,341
and he better goddamn well fix it.

67
00:04:38,513 --> 00:04:40,699
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Your old man will.

68
00:04:40,799 --> 00:04:42,529
Look, Rezian had me running errands
for you people

69
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:45,052
by me drumming up business
for your gas delivery operation.

70
00:04:45,224 --> 00:04:48,056
- Yes, I manage the books for the...
- Yeah, well, the owner

71
00:04:48,197 --> 00:04:50,825
wound up dead
with a gut full of super unleaded.

72
00:04:50,936 --> 00:04:53,142
That shit goes back on me,
for Christ's sakes.

73
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:56,135
- Please, this is a holy place.
- Well, jesus can kiss my ass.

74
00:04:56,235 --> 00:04:58,931
If that faggot Rezian need a
goddamn patsy to pin a murder on,

75
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:01,810
he just found himself in the
business end of a hollow point.

76
00:05:01,951 --> 00:05:04,063
You taking mental dictation?

77
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:07,146
We should take this conversation
across the street.

78
00:05:08,148 --> 00:05:10,948
You know what your daddy
and his crew do for a living?

79
00:05:11,191 --> 00:05:13,710
They're stone cold gangsters.

80
00:05:14,508 --> 00:05:17,606
I know what my father was.

81
00:05:17,732 --> 00:05:19,656
He came here from Armenia last year.

82
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:22,582
He asked me to give up my studies
in Berlin to come here and help

83
00:05:23,395 --> 00:05:25,947
to translate.
That's how I know

84
00:05:26,494 --> 00:05:28,669
that all our transactions
has been legal.

85
00:05:28,818 --> 00:05:31,223
Just because people haven't been getting
their feet chopped off lately

86
00:05:31,323 --> 00:05:34,201
that doesn't get the armenian mob
into the chamber of commerce.

87
00:05:37,294 --> 00:05:40,161
I'll speak to my father and I will ask
him to look into what happened

88
00:05:40,261 --> 00:05:42,214
- at the gas station.
- Hey, you tell your old man to

89
00:05:42,314 --> 00:05:46,593
take care of my problem or I will
create a world of problems for him.

90
00:05:55,904 --> 00:05:57,047
You call?

91
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:00,504
- What's up?
- Why don't you two tell me?

92
00:06:03,212 --> 00:06:05,590
I know what it's like to
lose someone close,

93
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,808
but the dance you two have been doing
is about something else

94
00:06:07,908 --> 00:06:09,016
and I want to know what.

95
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:14,003
I'm not sure I catch your drift.

96
00:06:14,112 --> 00:06:17,778
You've been hounding Nancy Gilroy
about Ben's mexican hook-ups

97
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,694
and I've threatened to charge her
with aiding and abetting if she

98
00:06:19,794 --> 00:06:23,041
doesn't tell the truth. What's so
important about these contacts?

99
00:06:23,176 --> 00:06:25,331
In a case that's been
closed for over a year.

100
00:06:25,431 --> 00:06:26,888
She and I had a conversation.

101
00:06:26,988 --> 00:06:30,325
I think with your appeals hearing
coming up, you'd be more helpful

102
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,390
if you're interested in saving your job.

103
00:06:34,033 --> 00:06:35,394
What were you after?

104
00:06:35,957 --> 00:06:38,237
Lem's killer.
Lem was on the run.

105
00:06:38,337 --> 00:06:40,635
He knew about Gilroy's underground
railroad to margarita ville.

106
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:43,192
I thought something might have
gone sideways in that regard.

107
00:06:43,322 --> 00:06:45,622
Coyote pulling a double cross,
I don't know.

108
00:06:46,686 --> 00:06:48,121
It's a bit of a stretch.

109
00:06:48,221 --> 00:06:51,379
Aceveda's had you detailed to
his dead mexican hat dance.

110
00:06:51,512 --> 00:06:53,166
Sounds like you and Dutch have
done a whole hell of a lot

111
00:06:53,266 --> 00:06:54,907
of finding Lem's killer.

112
00:06:55,032 --> 00:06:57,411
Don't ever use a tone
like that to me again.

113
00:06:59,857 --> 00:07:02,658
Transfer comes through soon,
it won't be an issue.

114
00:07:06,037 --> 00:07:08,744
My opper's been dark for 36 hours.

115
00:07:09,135 --> 00:07:11,451
Since you debriefed Hernan
without authorization

116
00:07:11,576 --> 00:07:13,531
I have to assume that his
cover's been compromised.

117
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,205
We don't know that with any certainty.

118
00:07:15,316 --> 00:07:17,882
He called in distressed.
He didn't show up to a meet.

119
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:20,260
What are you people doing to locate him?

120
00:07:20,448 --> 00:07:23,467
We've been sitting on his girlfriend's
place for the last 24 hours.

121
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:26,315
Also we're running surveillance
on his salvadoran associates.

122
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,310
My status report to the bureau
chief assigns accountability to you

123
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:31,675
and your personnel.

124
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:35,555
- Consider yourself notified.
- Nice. 10:42 a.m.,

125
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,826
in case you need a time stamp
for your ass-cover memo.

126
00:07:40,609 --> 00:07:42,690
If Hernan's still in play,

127
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:47,964
you will report any and all contact
with him to my office immediately.

128
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:57,803
I see now why Hernan reaches out
to us instead of his handlers.

129
00:07:57,903 --> 00:07:59,258
Shouldn't have inserted ourselves
into a

130
00:07:59,358 --> 00:08:01,425
long-term federal investigation
in the first place.

131
00:08:01,525 --> 00:08:03,783
Hernan can help us break
these San Marcos killings.

132
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:06,738
Who else, besides our team,
knew about Hernan's cover?

133
00:08:06,838 --> 00:08:09,229
It's Dutch and me, that's it.

134
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,998
Listen, Hernan can take care of himself.

135
00:08:12,109 --> 00:08:15,238
Still, we need to be able to throw him
a rope if necessary,

136
00:08:15,644 --> 00:08:18,273
and right now he's M.I.A.

137
00:08:18,978 --> 00:08:22,135
Stir up the waters looking for Hernan,
we risk putting him in a worse spot.

138
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:25,659
We got run a passive search. Make some
bank shots, see what bounces off of what.

139
00:08:25,768 --> 00:08:27,690
Anything turn up at
Hernan's girlfriend's?

140
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:30,092
Sat up at her house all night and
this morning. She was a no-show.

141
00:08:30,192 --> 00:08:31,851
It wasn't a complete waste
surveillance-wise.

142
00:08:31,951 --> 00:08:33,967
She does do yoga in the nude
with the blinds open.

143
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,285
Ah, that really worries me.
Hernan not showing up at home for that.

144
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,971
I say we work the other side of the
street. Talk to the Byz Lats.

145
00:08:40,071 --> 00:08:41,092
Truce isn't holding.

146
00:08:41,192 --> 00:08:43,571
It's possible Hernan got caught up
in another round of retaliation.

147
00:08:43,671 --> 00:08:45,417
Ronny and I will have a
sit-down with Santi.

148
00:08:45,517 --> 00:08:48,002
- Take Shane to back you up.
- No, no. We don't need him.

149
00:08:48,575 --> 00:08:51,923
Um, Shane has a history with
the Byz Lats. Could get in the way.

150
00:08:52,534 --> 00:08:56,555
Ok, Joey and I... We'll go pester the
salvadorans, spread the love around.

151
00:08:56,711 --> 00:08:58,010
Hey, Vic?

152
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:00,435
- I got to worry about you and Shane?
- No.

153
00:09:00,678 --> 00:09:02,540
Thanks for your concern though.

154
00:09:05,967 --> 00:09:07,047
Look, man.

155
00:09:07,391 --> 00:09:10,676
I can't forgive Shane for what he did,
but taking this beef public?

156
00:09:10,786 --> 00:09:14,095
I know, I know. Just tough keeping
a poker face with Shane

157
00:09:14,205 --> 00:09:16,447
playing off of Lem's murder
like he's trying to solve it.

158
00:09:16,547 --> 00:09:18,681
Well, then you need to keep
your anger in the cut.

159
00:09:18,894 --> 00:09:21,705
We're not clean in this either,
and I'm not spending the rest of my life

160
00:09:21,805 --> 00:09:24,704
- wearing state property.
- That makes two of us.

00:09:54,615 --> 00:09:56,915
Came by to make sure
you ain't misbehaving.

166
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:59,169
Still making good on the
truth with the salvadorans.

167
00:09:59,294 --> 00:10:01,985
Byz Lats say to sit down is
no pitch with the salvadorenos.

168
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,300
- On account of you trying to play us.
- No tiendo.

169
00:10:04,442 --> 00:10:07,931
We heard about the rat ya got undercover
with those fools. I ain't stupid, homes.

170
00:10:09,073 --> 00:10:10,466
You're full of shit.

171
00:10:11,015 --> 00:10:13,155
If we had someone under
with the salvadorans,

172
00:10:13,255 --> 00:10:15,161
we would have taken you
and them down by now.

173
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,821
Well, what my source
tells me is live or die.

174
00:10:17,962 --> 00:10:20,055
There will be no sit-down with my crew
until the salvadorans

175
00:10:20,155 --> 00:10:21,952
take care of the snitch
in their own house,

176
00:10:23,086 --> 00:10:24,792
'cause we ain't walking into no trap.

177
00:10:24,918 --> 00:10:28,203
Well, you need your ouija board,
'cause you're channeling some bad intel.

178
00:10:28,423 --> 00:10:30,316
Hey, I'm all about the peace,

179
00:10:30,676 --> 00:10:33,665
but you got a problem yourself,
homes, trying to double-cross us,

180
00:10:34,181 --> 00:10:36,074
'cause you haven't come
through like you promised.

181
00:10:36,199 --> 00:10:37,904
And you don't have the answers
on the San Marcos slaughter.

182
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:39,640
We're working on that.

183
00:10:40,104 --> 00:10:42,122
Yeah, where?

184
00:10:44,094 --> 00:10:46,425
- On the way.
- Mal noticias?

185
00:10:49,945 --> 00:10:52,370
Shit.
Found a body.

186
00:10:52,542 --> 00:10:53,903
Hernan?

187
00:10:55,689 --> 00:11:00,270
We got a male, hispanic.
20s, 30s, salvadoran ink.

188
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:04,420
Hacked to pieces.
Looks like a fresh dump job. No I.d.

189
00:11:07,339 --> 00:11:08,981
Well, that's not him.

190
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,422
Read your stars in machete.
It's not Hernan.

191
00:11:11,547 --> 00:11:12,873
Good news.
Doesn't mean they're not going

192
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:14,410
through their ranks till
they find him, though.

193
00:11:14,521 --> 00:11:17,623
Get a canvas going. Spot like this,
decent shot somebody saw something.

194
00:11:17,723 --> 00:11:18,855
Sure.

195
00:11:21,171 --> 00:11:23,655
My son didn't lie on purpose.
He just didn't say what he saw

196
00:11:23,755 --> 00:11:26,495
on account of the girl he was with
being too young.

197
00:11:26,595 --> 00:11:29,621
I thought she was 18 until she invites
me to her quinceanera.

198
00:11:29,902 --> 00:11:32,171
Tell him what I heard you
telling your brother.

199
00:11:33,469 --> 00:11:35,628
Her parents was gone,

200
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:37,929
and we were up in the bedroom.

201
00:11:38,868 --> 00:11:40,417
Trisha was on top.

202
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:44,204
Anyway, she's bouncing and she
looks out the window and this

203
00:11:44,314 --> 00:11:47,083
this load pulls up into the alley...
A camero.

204
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,741
- What color?
- Uh, dark green

205
00:11:48,851 --> 00:11:50,885
with grey primer in the front.

206
00:11:52,161 --> 00:11:55,244
This guy gets out, he dumps a couple
of trash bags and splits.

207
00:11:55,369 --> 00:11:56,683
What's he look like?

208
00:11:57,778 --> 00:12:00,172
Vato.
Regular dude, you know?

209
00:12:00,564 --> 00:12:04,732
License plate was 1BJ somethin'.
I... I... I didn't get the rest.

210
00:12:04,931 --> 00:12:08,122
You're sure?
Yeah. Yeah. 1BJ.

211
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,688
That's what I told my chabata I needed.
Like, it was a sign, you know?

212
00:12:15,342 --> 00:12:16,773
I spoke to my father.

213
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:19,884
He asked me to let you know that he's
very concerned about your situation.

214
00:12:19,984 --> 00:12:21,722
That he's concerned doesn't help
me one goddamn bit.

215
00:12:21,822 --> 00:12:23,517
It's going to take the names of
the people who killed

216
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:24,925
that gas station owner to clear my ass.

217
00:12:25,025 --> 00:12:28,042
He knows that, and he asks for
your patience and

218
00:12:28,432 --> 00:12:31,599
for me, in the meantime, to give
you this for your troubles.

219
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:37,019
Can I also ask you a favor?

220
00:12:37,186 --> 00:12:39,931
Doing favors for you people is
how I got my ass in this sling.

221
00:12:41,816 --> 00:12:44,725
We own several apartment buildings
and there have been robberies.

222
00:12:44,851 --> 00:12:47,796
- Well, report it to the police.
- We have,

223
00:12:48,112 --> 00:12:50,071
but your people have not
been very helpful.

224
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,608
It might have something to do
with the property owner's last name.

225
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:55,631
- There's not a lot of love there.
- Tenants are getting nervous.

226
00:12:55,731 --> 00:12:57,722
It's getting harder to
rent out vacancies.

227
00:12:57,849 --> 00:12:59,429
Crimes like this make it very difficult

228
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:02,048
or get good prices if we
ever decide to sell.

229
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:04,652
Could you find out who's
responsible, please?

230
00:13:05,215 --> 00:13:08,646
Finding out who did it and getting him
off the streets are 2 different things.

231
00:13:08,758 --> 00:13:10,505
Anything you can find.

232
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,579
I know it's a lot to ask,
but I need help.

233
00:13:15,206 --> 00:13:18,092
Are you a mob daughter or
a damsel in distress?

234
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:23,717
Give me the addresses.
Pay me for my time.

235
00:13:23,957 --> 00:13:26,362
I'll pull out my shovel
and start digging.

236
00:13:29,819 --> 00:13:31,318
Just leave it by the file cabinet.

237
00:13:31,418 --> 00:13:33,587
I'll fill out the rest of the
paperwork when I get over there.

238
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:35,121
- All right.
- Hey, Tina.

239
00:13:35,582 --> 00:13:39,039
You and Joey responded to
a call a couple weeks back.

240
00:13:39,139 --> 00:13:41,928
- 3013 Windmer.
- I don't know. Did we?

241
00:13:42,042 --> 00:13:43,297
It's your report.

242
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:48,195
The russian chicks. Yeah, I remember.

243
00:13:48,309 --> 00:13:50,839
Neighbors called in a noise complaint.
One of the girls said

244
00:13:50,939 --> 00:13:54,005
her drunk ex-boyfriend
tore up the place and then took off.

245
00:13:54,105 --> 00:13:55,661
1-211?

246
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:58,285
She didn't mention anything
about him stealing anything.

247
00:13:58,385 --> 00:13:59,898
She wasn't real cooperative though.

248
00:13:59,998 --> 00:14:02,608
Kind of got the feeling she didn't want
to talk to cops, 'cause she was working.

249
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,109
- It's like that, huh?
- Look, any citizen chilling out at the crib

250
00:14:05,209 --> 00:14:07,521
in the middle of the day
in fishnets and garters,

251
00:14:07,621 --> 00:14:09,629
it's either a pro or a cross dresser.

252
00:14:09,734 --> 00:14:11,306
- Thanks.
- All right.

253
00:14:16,391 --> 00:14:18,303
Any luck IDing the car used
to dump the body?

254
00:14:18,415 --> 00:14:23,142
Partial kickback. 5 plates.
One registered to one Leticia Cepedo.

255
00:14:23,242 --> 00:14:24,813
- Hernan's girlfriend?
- Yeah.

256
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:26,815
- I'll put out an A.P.B. On the car.
- No, no, no.

257
00:14:26,915 --> 00:14:28,159
It'll attract too much attention.

258
00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:31,675
Vehicle description information
broadcast only. Stake and notify us.

259
00:14:31,775 --> 00:14:34,696
Suppose it was Hernan the one they saw
dumping the d.v. How do we spin that?

260
00:14:34,802 --> 00:14:36,890
We don't until we have to.

261
00:14:48,106 --> 00:14:50,729
- yes, who is it please?
- It's Matthew.

262
00:14:50,829 --> 00:14:52,423
I called you from the airport.

263
00:14:52,534 --> 00:14:54,164
Who are you here to see?

264
00:14:54,317 --> 00:14:57,402
Well, after hearing that sexy voice,
I'm hoping it's you, darlin'.

265
00:15:04,912 --> 00:15:05,955
Hey.

266
00:15:13,404 --> 00:15:14,788
Hey there.

267
00:15:16,431 --> 00:15:18,562
- Are you a police officer?
- You kidding?

268
00:15:18,662 --> 00:15:21,052
Sounds like you're russian.
That's hot.

269
00:15:25,513 --> 00:15:27,413
Let me see your cock.

270
00:15:39,386 --> 00:15:43,245
- Did you want the full hour?
- I'm in no kind of rush.

271
00:15:44,741 --> 00:15:46,501
Donation's 300.

272
00:15:46,601 --> 00:15:49,685
Money exchanged is for time
and companionship only.

273
00:15:49,785 --> 00:15:54,010
Anything else is a matter of personal
choice between consenting adults.

274
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:56,134
- Get comfortable.
- You're under arrest.

275
00:15:56,234 --> 00:15:58,812
You let me touch your dick.
That's entrapment, I know the law.

276
00:15:58,912 --> 00:16:01,054
It's my word against your
magic little fingers.

277
00:16:02,104 --> 00:16:05,213
Now, zip me back up.
Put your hands behind your back.

278
00:16:05,433 --> 00:16:08,186
- D'you know who did this to you, ma'am?
- Get me out of here.

279
00:16:08,286 --> 00:16:09,827
We're going to take care
of you right away.

280
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,802
In the meantime, can you describe
your attacker?

281
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,651
- No.
- What do we got?

282
00:16:13,751 --> 00:16:16,053
White female victim.
Stab and grab.

283
00:16:16,217 --> 00:16:18,470
- Definitely not from this hood.
- Hey,

284
00:16:18,587 --> 00:16:20,710
Hey, I know you. I saw you last night.

285
00:16:20,827 --> 00:16:23,549
Sunset and vermont?
30 feet tall, 60 feet wide?

286
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,983
You know, you're a lot
prettier in person.

287
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:29,917
Apartment just put up a billboard.
Guess I'm a celebrity now.

288
00:16:30,035 --> 00:16:31,498
- Well, congrats.
- Excuse me ma'am,

289
00:16:31,598 --> 00:16:33,551
I'm detective Billings.
This is detective...

290
00:16:33,651 --> 00:16:35,690
Oh, don't bother. She's
asking for her lawyer.

291
00:16:35,824 --> 00:16:38,120
- Why?
- Cedars. Take me to Cedars.

292
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,610
- Doctor Klebanoff.
- That's why I don't work the west side.

293
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:42,968
Tired of assholes.
Anybody have a sharpie?

294
00:16:43,889 --> 00:16:45,250
Guy wants an autograph.

295
00:16:48,977 --> 00:16:52,566
Uh, ma'am, I'm detective Wagenbach.
This is detective Billings.

296
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,663
You're aware a woman was
attacked out here this morning?

297
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:58,015
I no see nothing.
You go.

298
00:16:58,244 --> 00:17:00,707
- She may have been a customer.
- Oh, no customer.

299
00:17:01,141 --> 00:17:04,637
- Where does that go?
- Locked door. No have key.

300
00:17:05,332 --> 00:17:08,663
- Ma'am, please, a woman...
- You have no warrant.

301
00:17:08,898 --> 00:17:11,267
You... You go.

302
00:17:13,203 --> 00:17:14,252
Ok.

303
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:19,857
- Unis found the Camero. 5th and Virgil.
- Hiatt know?

304
00:17:19,962 --> 00:17:21,616
Yeah. He and Julien are en route.

305
00:17:22,889 --> 00:17:26,349
Hernan or his girlfriend will have
to come back for the car eventually.

306
00:17:26,909 --> 00:17:28,739
Shane's wound pretty tight.

307
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:32,675
He starts unraveling one of
these days, what then?

308
00:17:33,165 --> 00:17:35,299
There's something you should know.

309
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:39,109
He generated a document.

310
00:17:39,857 --> 00:17:43,634
Remembrances of Things past.
Strike team style.

311
00:17:45,379 --> 00:17:48,628
All the shit we've ever been
into in black and white.

312
00:17:49,185 --> 00:17:50,640
You're in it, too.

313
00:17:51,132 --> 00:17:52,200
Jesus.

314
00:17:53,801 --> 00:17:56,382
- How do you know?
- He gave me a copy

315
00:17:56,487 --> 00:18:00,288
to let me know he has a suitcase
he can use against us if he had to.

316
00:18:01,909 --> 00:18:04,068
- What did you do with it?
- I burned it.

317
00:18:06,959 --> 00:18:08,988
Mara knows everything, too.

318
00:18:13,323 --> 00:18:17,358
It's a text message.
Shit is early. Right now.

319
00:18:17,777 --> 00:18:19,490
Hernan must have seen us watching.

320
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:23,185
- Let's go find out.
- Um... I'm going to go in alone.

321
00:18:23,786 --> 00:18:25,437
- Keep it low key.
- Could be a set-up.

322
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:27,236
Or another dead body.

323
00:18:27,336 --> 00:18:29,977
- Everybody, hold your position.
- Copy that.

324
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:56,876
- Hold it! Who the hell are you?
- Too dangerous for Hernan to come.

325
00:18:56,976 --> 00:18:59,293
He sent me instead.
He says not to worry, he's ok now.

326
00:18:59,393 --> 00:19:01,567
You lying or this is some
kind of a trick?

327
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:04,051
Your mother won't even recognize
you when I'm through.

328
00:19:04,151 --> 00:19:06,217
Please stop. You're hurting me. Please.

329
00:19:06,844 --> 00:19:08,482
- Please.
- Who sent you?

330
00:19:08,582 --> 00:19:11,830
Hernan, I swear. I swear.
On my baby sister's life, please.

331
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:13,457
He told me to give you a message.

332
00:19:18,797 --> 00:19:22,054
He... He and a couple of soldiers,
they're doing a job tonight.

333
00:19:22,154 --> 00:19:25,769
- Where and when?
- Alvarado, near the park.

334
00:19:25,869 --> 00:19:28,933
Robbing a gun store.
6:00.

335
00:19:29,033 --> 00:19:32,806
Hernan says to let it go down,
but to get the innocents out of the way.

336
00:19:33,085 --> 00:19:35,912
How much of what he's into
do you know about?

337
00:19:36,132 --> 00:19:38,361
Just that he's some sort of cop

338
00:19:38,487 --> 00:19:40,915
and that he trusts you to have his back.

339
00:19:41,651 --> 00:19:43,973
You told anybody else about any of this?

340
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:47,539
No, I... No, that could
get us both killed.

341
00:19:48,894 --> 00:19:52,126
Like that guy your boyfriend dumped
in that vacant alley with your car?

342
00:19:52,226 --> 00:19:55,804
Hernan didn't have no choice, all right?
That guy was a snitch.

343
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:57,761
Otavio had him executed,

344
00:19:57,861 --> 00:20:01,413
all right? Ordered Hernan to get
rid of the body to prove his loyalty.

345
00:20:03,436 --> 00:20:05,970
Can you get a message to Hernan?
All right.

346
00:20:06,075 --> 00:20:09,189
You tell him that he's giving his bosses
in D.C. A bad case of the nerves.

347
00:20:09,289 --> 00:20:10,697
They want him to come in.

348
00:20:10,797 --> 00:20:13,304
Also, leave the car parked where it is.

349
00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:16,984
I'll figure out a plan to deal
with this robbery.

350
00:20:17,107 --> 00:20:21,166
I'll leave any instructions
in the right front wheel well of the car

351
00:20:21,307 --> 00:20:22,843
by 4:00.

352
00:20:29,531 --> 00:20:32,162
All right.
I want to speak to my attorney.

353
00:20:32,262 --> 00:20:33,914
Look, I don't give a shit if
you've got an illegal

354
00:20:34,014 --> 00:20:35,866
fish market
running out of your bedroom.

355
00:20:35,988 --> 00:20:37,662
I just want to know what
went down at your condo

356
00:20:37,762 --> 00:20:39,765
2 weeks ago
you don't want to talk to cops about.

357
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:42,704
You do that, you street walk
out of here a free woman.

358
00:20:45,115 --> 00:20:47,660
You just bought you and your
money maker 30 days in county.

359
00:20:48,071 --> 00:20:49,572
We got jacked.

360
00:20:50,842 --> 00:20:53,293
- How much?
- 2,500.

361
00:20:54,032 --> 00:20:55,857
This guy called for an appointment.

362
00:20:55,957 --> 00:20:58,769
Sounded wise,
like a regular business john.

363
00:20:58,869 --> 00:21:01,534
I answer the door, 3 black men
pushed their way in.

364
00:21:01,657 --> 00:21:03,994
They made us lay down face
down on the floor.

365
00:21:04,094 --> 00:21:07,710
Said if we made any moves or
looked at them, they'd shoot us.

366
00:21:08,032 --> 00:21:09,346
Who are you trickin' for?

367
00:21:09,463 --> 00:21:13,346
The deal was, I tell you what happened,
you forget about the rest of what I do.

368
00:21:20,301 --> 00:21:22,319
Your bosses know about the burglary?

369
00:21:22,996 --> 00:21:26,172
Me and the girls been working
double shifts ever since.

370
00:21:26,272 --> 00:21:29,115
No days off until the money's paid back.

371
00:21:29,215 --> 00:21:32,026
I need you to try and remember
what these guys looked like.

372
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:34,961
How long is this going to take?

373
00:21:35,061 --> 00:21:38,706
I got a golden shower planned
this afternoon. Big tipper.

374
00:21:38,806 --> 00:21:42,137
I got to start drinking iced tea
to get it the way he likes.

375
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:47,832
I'll be right back with those
mug books and a snapple.

376
00:21:49,999 --> 00:21:51,548
Is Hernan alive?

377
00:21:51,662 --> 00:21:53,909
Assuming his girlfriend's telling
the truth in any of this.

378
00:21:54,009 --> 00:21:56,805
Well, my strong sense and her
brown panties lead me to believe

379
00:21:56,905 --> 00:21:59,284
she's on the level.
If we interdict this robbery,

380
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:01,698
we blow Hernan's cover and
whatever big one he's about to hit.

381
00:22:01,798 --> 00:22:04,873
We're not letting that kind of heat
get into the hands of these thugs.

382
00:22:04,976 --> 00:22:07,169
Think of the damage they did
with a couple machetes.

383
00:22:07,269 --> 00:22:09,236
There's got to be a way
to keep those guns off the street

384
00:22:09,336 --> 00:22:11,354
- and still keep Hernan in play.
- The longer he stays under,

385
00:22:11,454 --> 00:22:14,336
the better the chance he's going to give
us who did the San Marcos killings.

386
00:22:14,436 --> 00:22:17,538
Look, screw his cover.
Our instructions are to notify I.C.E.

387
00:22:17,638 --> 00:22:19,524
As soon as he makes contact.

388
00:22:19,636 --> 00:22:22,157
Technically, he didn't.
The girlfriend did.

389
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:24,899
Can we at least hold off notifying
I.C.E. until we scoop here?

390
00:22:24,999 --> 00:22:27,216
Getting the feds involved with
the situation reports

391
00:22:27,316 --> 00:22:29,471
and the bureau chiefs will
foobar the whole thing.

392
00:22:29,571 --> 00:22:32,841
Your orders are to head off this robbery
and arrest the people involved.

393
00:22:32,941 --> 00:22:36,340
And get Shane in on this.
He's with a hooker in interrogation.

394
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,996
I don't want him freelancing for vice
while he's still under my command.

395
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:48,642
We got to protect Claudette
from ourself here.

396
00:22:48,756 --> 00:22:50,629
That fed ragging on her this morning
has got her taking the

397
00:22:50,729 --> 00:22:52,284
path of least resistance.

398
00:22:52,384 --> 00:22:54,856
Reel in Hernan. Turn him over to I.C.E.

399
00:22:55,155 --> 00:22:56,445
Come here.

400
00:23:00,439 --> 00:23:03,714
It's one hell of a risk. Disobeying an
order and going behind her back

401
00:23:03,814 --> 00:23:06,551
- when we don't even know for sure.
- You want to stay in this job?

402
00:23:06,686 --> 00:23:10,187
Went on the street, you don't do it
by listening to upper management.

403
00:23:10,287 --> 00:23:13,638
Now, we pull this off, we keep
the guns out of the wrong hands and

404
00:23:13,738 --> 00:23:18,046
we preserve Hernan's cover long
enough to find out about San Marcos.

405
00:23:21,463 --> 00:23:23,551
No guts, no glory, right?

406
00:23:28,284 --> 00:23:30,829
These boost jobs in
your pop's buildings.

407
00:23:30,947 --> 00:23:34,254
It's part of a string of a dozen or
more over the last six months.

408
00:23:34,366 --> 00:23:36,508
Interesting thing, his crew only targets
places that

409
00:23:36,608 --> 00:23:38,861
escort services operate out of.

410
00:23:38,961 --> 00:23:41,947
A whole gang of russian hookers
call your pop's buildings home.

411
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:45,252
He's not involved in that kind of thing.
We are real estate investors.

412
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:47,962
Specializing in cossack cooch.

413
00:23:48,073 --> 00:23:49,900
It's called a natasha trade.

414
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,750
Girl gets a place to live,
1/3, 2/3 split with the boss,

415
00:23:53,909 --> 00:23:57,698
who also holds onto their
passports for safe keeping.

416
00:23:58,152 --> 00:24:01,366
Now, whatever legit business
your father's gotten into,

417
00:24:01,613 --> 00:24:05,587
it's just window dressing wrapped around
the same old school gangster shit.

418
00:24:09,687 --> 00:24:12,727
- And the robbers?
- I got a tentative I.D. On one of them.

419
00:24:12,827 --> 00:24:14,381
Still needs to be verified.

420
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:18,407
I'll be in touch when I get
something a little more definite.

421
00:24:18,507 --> 00:24:22,189
Thank you.
And, uh, I'm sorry for the troubles.

422
00:24:27,205 --> 00:24:29,375
These gentlemen have agreed
to immunity, Eleanor.

423
00:24:29,475 --> 00:24:31,272
You tell them everything you remember.

424
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,096
I know these guys, it's ok.

425
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:39,183
My best friend told me about this place.
It has incredible replicas. I bought 3.

426
00:24:39,308 --> 00:24:41,057
A little overboard, but
at those prices, I could...

427
00:24:41,157 --> 00:24:43,939
You make it a habit of roaming
the barrio for cheap handbags?

428
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,330
Nurses here do it all the time.

429
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:49,365
He knocked me down, stabbed me,
took off running. There wasn't even

430
00:24:49,465 --> 00:24:51,199
time to grab my mace.

431
00:24:51,441 --> 00:24:54,101
So, you lost the 3 purses you bought,

432
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:56,305
plus the one you had with you.
They're not purses.

433
00:24:56,405 --> 00:24:59,767
2 were evening clutches,
the other was a keepall.

434
00:24:59,892 --> 00:25:02,181
And what did this keepall
bandit look like?

435
00:25:02,281 --> 00:25:04,461
Mexican, puerto rican.
Smelled awful,

436
00:25:04,602 --> 00:25:07,794
like when we had a dead rat
in the wall at the montecito house.

437
00:25:08,176 --> 00:25:11,190
Probably thought the knock-offs were
real. Figured he'd struck a gold mine.

438
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:15,081
Knock-offs are what they sell in Times
Square. These are quality replicas.

439
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:17,213
There's quite a difference.

440
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:21,478
She said for $60 you can't tell
the difference from the real thing.

441
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,481
These replicas are that amazing.

442
00:25:23,606 --> 00:25:25,395
Well, it's all about the
quality of hardware.

443
00:25:25,495 --> 00:25:27,499
Embossed, well-sealed, good weight.

444
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:29,177
Men have hustler magazine,

445
00:25:29,302 --> 00:25:32,478
- I have the Marc Jacobs look book.
- I'm a classic Gucci girl.

446
00:25:32,587 --> 00:25:36,280
Medium hobo with a single
non-adjustable buckle strap.

447
00:25:36,594 --> 00:25:40,552
I keep thinking someday,
but not at these wages.

448
00:25:40,677 --> 00:25:42,930
I got my diaper bag from old navy.

449
00:25:45,387 --> 00:25:47,468
I've seen those. They're pretty stylish.

450
00:25:49,816 --> 00:25:51,991
All right. I've coordinated
with the unis.

451
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,119
Hey. What's going on?

452
00:25:54,244 --> 00:25:57,010
The sals are knocking over a gun store,
we're going to let them do it.

453
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,865
Vic's walking everyone
through the details.

454
00:25:58,965 --> 00:26:01,607
Eddie and Tina are going to be running
the checkpoint over on the monitor.

455
00:26:01,707 --> 00:26:03,004
Are they in the loop on
our end of the plan?

456
00:26:03,104 --> 00:26:05,976
No. Which is why our first priority
needs to be watching their backs

457
00:26:06,076 --> 00:26:07,817
- in case this thing goes sideways.
- That's not going to happen.

458
00:26:07,917 --> 00:26:10,753
As long as Hernan sticks to the
playbook that we hid on his front wheel.

459
00:26:10,853 --> 00:26:13,929
Problem is, we've been communicating
with him by carrier pigeon essentially,

460
00:26:14,029 --> 00:26:15,929
so we've got to be ready for
anything that jumps up.

461
00:26:16,029 --> 00:26:17,869
All right, so, everyone clear
on their assignments?

462
00:26:17,969 --> 00:26:19,945
- Yeah.
- What do you want me to do?

463
00:26:20,055 --> 00:26:21,838
I'll fill you in on the way.

464
00:26:26,939 --> 00:26:28,426
Right on time.

465
00:26:28,911 --> 00:26:32,024
- Julien. You're about to have company.
- Copy that.

466
00:26:32,823 --> 00:26:34,372
Alive and upright.

467
00:26:34,482 --> 00:26:36,907
- You stake the point.
- Good.

468
00:26:40,396 --> 00:26:41,989
Ho. Hey! Take it easy.

469
00:26:42,089 --> 00:26:43,463
Be cool, man, be cool.

470
00:26:43,573 --> 00:26:45,262
- Keys, man, keys.
- In my pocket.

471
00:26:50,361 --> 00:26:51,581
Here they come.

472
00:27:02,595 --> 00:27:04,300
Jesus, nice haul.

473
00:27:08,922 --> 00:27:12,567
Suspect vehicle is on the move.
Julien, you ok?

474
00:27:12,693 --> 00:27:14,867
Affirmative, all good here.

475
00:27:17,825 --> 00:27:18,847
Got a visual.

476
00:27:18,947 --> 00:27:21,158
Eastbound on sunset, coming
up on echo park.

477
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:22,269
Copy that.

478
00:27:24,194 --> 00:27:26,447
Ok. We're moving into second position.

479
00:27:26,995 --> 00:27:29,920
We see you up ahead.
We're 5 car lengths behind.

480
00:27:30,829 --> 00:27:34,130
All right, don't get too close to him
now. Hang back. Hang back.

481
00:27:34,365 --> 00:27:37,541
Buckle up, Shane.
He's turning into the checkpoint.

482
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:43,190
Ready, please.
It's just a routine check.

483
00:27:49,574 --> 00:27:52,828
Have your license, registration,
proof of insurance ready, please.

484
00:27:57,538 --> 00:28:00,276
He's telling his buddy
his car registration expired.

485
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,781
- They don't look too happy.
- What to do?

486
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:05,925
Go for it.
And pray nobody asks to pop the trunk?

487
00:28:06,043 --> 00:28:08,359
Or risk going away for a few decades.

488
00:28:08,468 --> 00:28:10,139
If it were me, I'd go with my feet.

489
00:28:10,239 --> 00:28:14,493
Let's hope Hernan makes the case
and he's the only one who pulls a gun.

490
00:28:16,856 --> 00:28:19,109
- We've got rabbits.
- Shane, go!

491
00:28:22,332 --> 00:28:23,928
Easy, easy.

492
00:28:24,515 --> 00:28:27,613
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Hey, buddy,
take it easy, take it easy, all right?

493
00:28:29,358 --> 00:28:30,938
Shane. You ok?

494
00:28:31,564 --> 00:28:33,301
Ok, we're clear. That's good.

495
00:28:34,678 --> 00:28:36,712
- It's all right. No worries.
- It's ok, Danny.

496
00:28:36,853 --> 00:28:39,482
We can call the surveillance off.
We got what we wanted.

497
00:28:39,591 --> 00:28:40,608
It's ok.

498
00:28:43,237 --> 00:28:45,862
Exploratory committee allows you
to put a finger in the air

499
00:28:45,962 --> 00:28:47,427
to find out what the
public wants to hear.

500
00:28:47,527 --> 00:28:49,278
Why not just announce my candidacy?

501
00:28:49,387 --> 00:28:52,239
Let me tell you why that's a shit awful
idea. You say you're running for mayor,

502
00:28:52,339 --> 00:28:55,275
you immediately trigger a financial
disclosure event under the statute.

503
00:28:55,375 --> 00:28:57,254
And our supporters and how
much they're giving.

504
00:28:57,354 --> 00:28:59,328
Information our enemies
can use against us.

505
00:28:59,428 --> 00:29:01,994
Exploratory committee also allows you
to investigate the feasibility

506
00:29:02,094 --> 00:29:03,907
of running for another office.

507
00:29:04,377 --> 00:29:06,208
State assembly, for instance.

508
00:29:06,364 --> 00:29:08,351
Would we even have a shot at that?

509
00:29:09,822 --> 00:29:11,261
With some massaging.

510
00:29:15,589 --> 00:29:17,685
- You have a korean problem.
- Conservative.

511
00:29:17,811 --> 00:29:20,072
Less sympathetic to our
populous latino platform.

512
00:29:20,172 --> 00:29:23,100
But any election can be won
by cracking, stacking, and packing.

513
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,363
- You're talking about redistricting.
- Crack the korean constituency,

514
00:29:26,463 --> 00:29:30,028
stack it over 3 or 4 other districts,
you nullify their influence,

515
00:29:30,128 --> 00:29:31,946
- pack the new boundary with latinos.
- Yeah.

516
00:29:32,046 --> 00:29:34,574
Then focus our resources on
getting out the core vote.

517
00:29:34,674 --> 00:29:37,018
But I would also annex these folks here.

518
00:29:37,127 --> 00:29:39,282
Our message doesn't fly
with black folks either.

519
00:29:39,382 --> 00:29:42,046
Doesn't matter. They don't vote.
Represent more people,

520
00:29:42,146 --> 00:29:43,821
the more influence you
have in sacramento

521
00:29:43,921 --> 00:29:47,048
- and even though they don't support us...
- They don't hurt you either.

522
00:29:47,205 --> 00:29:51,019
Best part of all this is you can spearhead
the redistricting of your future office

523
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:53,494
right now from your councilman's seat

524
00:29:53,918 --> 00:29:58,048
redrawing these lines is going to
cost a great deal of money.

525
00:29:58,597 --> 00:30:00,600
Mother's milk of politics.

526
00:30:01,867 --> 00:30:04,636
- For the exploratory committee.
- Thank you.

527
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:09,940
It's only for 100,000.

528
00:30:10,349 --> 00:30:11,659
You'll get the other half when

529
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:15,011
the people responsible for the San
Marcos killings are brought to justice.

530
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,420
There will be closure.
I promise you.

531
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,247
Before I plow any more
money into a war zone,

532
00:30:21,466 --> 00:30:24,032
I need to see a demonstration
of the rule of law,

533
00:30:24,173 --> 00:30:25,378
not the law of the jungle.

534
00:30:26,145 --> 00:30:28,434
Should have denied a request
for immunity and booked her.

535
00:30:28,534 --> 00:30:30,412
Yeah, especially after she
slammed Dutch boy

536
00:30:30,512 --> 00:30:32,560
for being too low brow to
appreciate the finer things.

537
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:34,309
Trademark infringement's a serious deal.

538
00:30:34,409 --> 00:30:37,079
So's assault with a deadly weapon.
Find the guy with the knife.

539
00:30:37,179 --> 00:30:39,899
At least expedite a search
warrant for the knock-off emporium.

540
00:30:39,999 --> 00:30:43,127
- Is this really a pressing issue?
- As long as this place stays in business,

541
00:30:43,227 --> 00:30:45,239
it's going to attract upscale clientele
to a shitty neighborhood.

542
00:30:45,339 --> 00:30:47,000
Which could lead to more
stabbings or worse.

543
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:51,025
I'll get to it but make an arrest. The
last thing I need is a well-connected

544
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:55,671
pampered socialite breathing down
my neck. That's what I have Aceveda for.

545
00:30:55,891 --> 00:30:59,533
If you're harboring for a San Marcos
update, no news to report.

546
00:30:59,633 --> 00:31:01,852
Well, I'm sure you're doing
everything you can.

547
00:31:02,173 --> 00:31:05,553
I actually came down to see what
else you need in the way of resources,

548
00:31:05,709 --> 00:31:09,198
- additional overtime, tech support.
- All of the above.

549
00:31:10,616 --> 00:31:13,760
What can you tell me about this
latest homicide? Is it connected?

550
00:31:13,878 --> 00:31:16,824
I'm already in hot water for briefing
you about the I.C.E. agent

551
00:31:16,924 --> 00:31:20,684
we went after in the warrant search,
then he went missing.

552
00:31:20,888 --> 00:31:22,922
Claudette, this is me.

553
00:31:23,219 --> 00:31:25,206
- You're not suggesting...
- No, of course not,

554
00:31:25,504 --> 00:31:29,521
but I should not have been
discussing secure intel with anyone.

555
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:32,044
Not even you.
It's note to self.

556
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,687
Well...

557
00:31:33,969 --> 00:31:37,990
Put together a memo detailing the things
you need and I'll get right to it.

558
00:31:45,634 --> 00:31:47,590
Never hit the streets of Farmington.

559
00:31:48,091 --> 00:31:50,458
But Hernan's in the wind, and the
other perps are still at large.

560
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:52,628
- How did that happen?
- I called an audible.

561
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:55,183
The wiser course of action was
not to intercept them

562
00:31:55,283 --> 00:31:58,000
at the gun store where these
could have been used against my team.

563
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,320
Safer to wait until they
were locked in the trunk.

564
00:32:00,429 --> 00:32:03,793
At the checkpoint, the suspects read
the play and were able to elude capture,

565
00:32:03,949 --> 00:32:05,686
but we'll get 'em.

566
00:32:06,077 --> 00:32:07,861
Give us a second, will ya?

567
00:32:10,624 --> 00:32:14,415
That man's in the mix. You think my
bullshit detector isn't already on high?

568
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:17,257
Now. Listen.
I made this call, ok, not him.

569
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,093
- Were the unis in on this?
- In on what?

570
00:32:19,193 --> 00:32:22,100
It was my understanding that they were
operating a routine insurance check.

571
00:32:22,211 --> 00:32:24,777
Authorized by whom?
Because it wasn't me.

572
00:32:24,902 --> 00:32:29,157
I go through that paperwork,
I bet I'll find your signature or Vic's.

573
00:32:29,487 --> 00:32:32,128
You knowingly put department personnel
in harm's way

574
00:32:32,228 --> 00:32:36,074
- without even giving them a heads up?
- Harm's way is part of the job description.

575
00:32:36,998 --> 00:32:39,818
I brought you in here
because I thought you could be trusted,

576
00:32:39,918 --> 00:32:42,420
because you're not Vic Mackey.
Now, you're letting him

577
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,650
pull you by the nose right
in my cross hairs.

578
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:47,681
No. This entire city is breathing
down your neck and mine

579
00:32:47,781 --> 00:32:51,249
over those 12 dead mexicans.
Hernan can close that case for us.

580
00:32:51,349 --> 00:32:55,743
This isn't about Hernan. You want to
follow Vic out the door, keep it up.

581
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,027
The choice is yours.

582
00:33:08,245 --> 00:33:10,420
- Hey, juneteenth freeman.
- Mmm?

583
00:33:10,686 --> 00:33:13,533
Parole officer said I'd find you
out here beautifying America.

584
00:33:13,815 --> 00:33:17,054
- You got about 400 hours left, right?
- What the hell you want?

585
00:33:17,157 --> 00:33:20,458
- Hey, who are you?
- Cooperating with a police investigation.

586
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:22,254
- Ok.
- Look, I'm all over the game

587
00:33:22,354 --> 00:33:24,604
you and your boys
have been running on the working girls.

588
00:33:25,153 --> 00:33:27,234
I don't know what you're
talking about, officer.

589
00:33:27,349 --> 00:33:28,951
You pick up enough garbage,
they're going to kick that felony

590
00:33:29,051 --> 00:33:32,065
down to misdemeanor possession. Unless,
of course, I start coming after you.

591
00:33:32,165 --> 00:33:34,776
A bunch of b and e's add
assaults and whatnot.

592
00:33:35,058 --> 00:33:38,199
- You can't prove shit.
- Try me.

593
00:33:38,299 --> 00:33:41,817
Course you could play this another way.
Cut me in on these jobs you're doing.

594
00:33:41,927 --> 00:33:45,052
I run interference. I monitor the
dispatch so you don't get all gaffled up

595
00:33:45,152 --> 00:33:47,559
like almost happened at
that condo on Winmore.

596
00:33:47,857 --> 00:33:50,705
I'm going to need 500 up front,
earnest money

597
00:33:51,096 --> 00:33:53,427
and an equal split
between you and the other 2.

598
00:33:55,227 --> 00:33:58,310
- Got to ask my niggs.
- You mean pancake and squeeze?

599
00:33:59,719 --> 00:34:02,425
How'd you know it was pancake
and squeeze doing the women?

600
00:34:02,566 --> 00:34:05,570
Saw you had priors together, but I didn't
know for sure until just right now.

601
00:34:05,711 --> 00:34:06,916
So, thank you.

602
00:34:08,645 --> 00:34:11,852
Look, if my dude's cool with this,
how am I going to get with you?

603
00:34:11,977 --> 00:34:13,464
Don't worry about it.

604
00:34:22,618 --> 00:34:25,857
You said your father was traveling, I
didn't think you meant highway to heaven.

605
00:34:26,327 --> 00:34:28,737
Ran an data search.
911 call,

606
00:34:28,846 --> 00:34:32,226
11 days ago. He was transported here
on a full cardiac arrest.

607
00:34:32,351 --> 00:34:35,480
Merciful jesus heard my prayers.
He's doing much better now.

608
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,004
No, he's not.

609
00:34:37,104 --> 00:34:40,590
I chatted up a nurse.
They don't expect him to last the week.

610
00:34:42,045 --> 00:34:44,485
How long do you think you
can keep this a secret?

611
00:34:46,129 --> 00:34:48,476
Long enough for a miracle.

612
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:51,965
In the meantime, you think you're
running the show?

613
00:34:54,681 --> 00:34:56,073
I don't know.

614
00:34:58,013 --> 00:34:59,640
I'm not going to let...

615
00:35:00,094 --> 00:35:02,801
everything my father spent a
lifetime building get...

616
00:35:03,224 --> 00:35:07,261
picked apart by... snakes and
vultures who see a weakness.

617
00:35:08,006 --> 00:35:09,917
Seems like you've already
got people in the

618
00:35:10,017 --> 00:35:12,785
organization freelancing
behind your back,

619
00:35:12,948 --> 00:35:16,356
running whores out of your
own buildings, doing murders.

620
00:35:16,456 --> 00:35:18,488
People loyal to my father.

621
00:35:18,785 --> 00:35:20,287
Many of them.

622
00:35:20,961 --> 00:35:22,366
I can count on you, yes?

623
00:35:22,466 --> 00:35:25,608
What, after you lied to me? Said you
had the gas station whack handled?

624
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:28,345
The guy can't even open his eyes.

625
00:35:29,581 --> 00:35:31,738
Look, the last time there was an
armenian jump-off,

626
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:35,340
an old world hit man, Margos,
crawled out of the woodwork.

627
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:39,362
A nice choir girl like you. You don't
want any part of that kind of bloodbath.

628
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:42,381
And if he could talk,
he'd tell you the same goddamn thing.

629
00:35:44,338 --> 00:35:46,654
I would like those names, please.

630
00:35:48,665 --> 00:35:50,260
You paid for them.

631
00:35:51,027 --> 00:35:53,984
You've got much bigger problems
than these idiots.

632
00:36:01,237 --> 00:36:04,504
Eleanor wasn't kidding when
she said she had an eye for detail.

633
00:36:04,604 --> 00:36:07,364
She described her attacker
right down to the pot mark.

634
00:36:07,464 --> 00:36:09,895
Yeah, right before she got
medevaced to cedars.

635
00:36:09,995 --> 00:36:12,214
Yeah. Said the guy had the
B.O. of a cadaver.

636
00:36:12,323 --> 00:36:15,155
If you two can stave off Tina's
paparazzi, start on skid row.

637
00:36:15,257 --> 00:36:17,562
I don't get it.
This woman can have anything she wants.

638
00:36:17,662 --> 00:36:20,144
Is saving a few bucks worth
a couple of stab wounds?

639
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:22,257
When it comes to Louis,
Gucci, and Fendi.

640
00:36:22,357 --> 00:36:25,840
Coach, Prada, Chanel. You know, and if
you're on a budget, Dooney and Bourke.

641
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:28,109
And every time her bag
passes off as the real thing

642
00:36:28,209 --> 00:36:31,590
when all of her friends are paying
through the nose on rodeo drive, she wins.

643
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:34,785
- You know, it's the thrill of the kill.
- Are they hearing themselves?

644
00:36:34,903 --> 00:36:37,180
It's a girl thing.
You guys just don't get it.

645
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,023
Yeah, it'd be like us trying to understand
why you guys love your balls so much

646
00:36:40,123 --> 00:36:42,233
that you got to play
pocket pool all the time.

647
00:36:47,108 --> 00:36:50,406
Hernan just texted me.
Everything went smooth on his end.

648
00:36:50,506 --> 00:36:51,970
Got props for getting his people out.

649
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:54,323
Called for a meet tonight.
He's got some intel.

650
00:36:54,667 --> 00:36:58,015
Better be worthwhile after
the ass reaming I just took.

651
00:36:58,704 --> 00:37:01,707
- I'll get the team.
- No need for everyone. I'll take Ronnie.

652
00:37:02,654 --> 00:37:03,804
Ok.

653
00:37:05,753 --> 00:37:08,397
The check you gave me
on Shane today, I heard you.

654
00:37:08,757 --> 00:37:11,370
As long as he's on your team,
I'll make it work.

655
00:37:12,012 --> 00:37:14,093
If it was up to me,
you'd be staying, too.

656
00:37:19,131 --> 00:37:20,289
You're out of here.

657
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,731
It's a done deal.

658
00:37:22,903 --> 00:37:25,781
Claudette's been playing you
since the day I showed up.

659
00:37:25,908 --> 00:37:28,924
She figured you'd be easier to handle
if you thought there was a future here,

660
00:37:29,024 --> 00:37:31,900
meanwhile orchestrating
things so there won't be.

661
00:37:34,818 --> 00:37:37,608
I'm really sorry, man.
I wish there was something I could do.

662
00:37:37,708 --> 00:37:39,105
You gave it to me straight.

663
00:37:39,771 --> 00:37:41,070
That's big.

664
00:37:42,979 --> 00:37:45,482
We'll be working together
for a while yet.

665
00:37:46,468 --> 00:37:48,987
Claudette's not the
only player at the table.

666
00:37:53,001 --> 00:37:56,291
I just don't get it.
You risk your life for something
that's a knock-off

667
00:37:56,391 --> 00:37:58,133
of something that's already a knock-off.

668
00:37:58,266 --> 00:38:01,146
Yeah, to hold what? Tampons and
the rest of their girl shit around?

669
00:38:01,246 --> 00:38:03,058
Get a lunchbox. Whack a mugger
with one of those,

670
00:38:03,158 --> 00:38:05,925
at least you'll draw some blood.
Chicks are nuts.

671
00:38:06,693 --> 00:38:10,823
African american male, 20s,
I.D. Juneteenth freeman.

672
00:38:10,926 --> 00:38:14,873
Out on parole,
found unconscious in an alleyway
with his testicles cut off.

673
00:38:14,973 --> 00:38:17,289
Yeah, some mex is probably
carting his dundeens around

674
00:38:17,389 --> 00:38:18,683
in a knock-off louis vuitton.

675
00:38:18,783 --> 00:38:21,750
- And paid for it with his money.
- It's not the only castration.

676
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:23,893
There's another one up at mission cross.

677
00:38:23,993 --> 00:38:26,397
African-american also.
I need you to follow up.

678
00:38:26,497 --> 00:38:29,327
Missing bags.
Maybe you boys can relate, too.

679
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:33,019
Women can be the coldest winter ever.

680
00:38:33,184 --> 00:38:34,560
Yeah, no shit.

681
00:38:38,345 --> 00:38:41,208
Thank you. Thank you.
Just another dirty day at the office.

682
00:38:44,963 --> 00:38:47,326
Whoo-hoo, that's some
perfume you're wearing.

683
00:38:47,822 --> 00:38:50,690
Pa chanel over here decided
to throw homemade shitballs at us.

684
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:52,881
Yeah, but not before we had to
haul him out of the sewer.

685
00:38:52,981 --> 00:38:54,277
I'll take them. You guys get cleaned up.

686
00:38:54,377 --> 00:38:58,579
No, no, no. Don't deny me the pleasure
of throwing his skanky ass in the cage.

687
00:39:04,516 --> 00:39:07,661
Hey, man, wanna swing by a dive
and take the edge off?

688
00:39:09,468 --> 00:39:11,560
What? I extend an invite,
you throw a shade?

689
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,457
Come on, man. What's that about?

690
00:39:23,202 --> 00:39:25,314
I know what you did to Lem,

691
00:39:25,627 --> 00:39:27,192
so don't hang at me.

692
00:39:27,771 --> 00:39:28,725
All right?

693
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:32,089
Vic had to spin what happened
like I'm the anti-christ?

694
00:39:32,449 --> 00:39:35,641
Because he knows that if it wasn't
for him, Lem would still be alive today.

695
00:39:35,743 --> 00:39:37,578
And that is the god's honest truth.

696
00:39:37,678 --> 00:39:41,310
Vic didn't pull the pin on that
grenade, did he? That was all you.

697
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:44,693
What happened was a tragedy,
but it was also goddamn inevitable.

698
00:39:44,834 --> 00:39:47,373
You even start any horseshit
about how you were protecting all of us,

699
00:39:47,473 --> 00:39:50,482
I will throw down with you right now.
I don't want to fight with you.

700
00:39:50,843 --> 00:39:52,831
Man, I got no beef with you at all.

701
00:39:52,931 --> 00:39:55,127
What about this journal, huh?
You write all this shit down,

702
00:39:55,227 --> 00:39:58,499
everything on paper that we have done
and you're trying to blackmail us...

703
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:00,626
- And that is no beef?
- No, no, no, no, no.

704
00:40:00,726 --> 00:40:03,962
- What am I missing?
- Did Vic tell you about it? Huh?

705
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:06,463
- Or did you actually read it?
- Are you telling me he's lying to me?

706
00:40:06,563 --> 00:40:08,047
No. No.

707
00:40:08,423 --> 00:40:11,756
I wrote it down.
All 24 pages.

708
00:40:12,146 --> 00:40:13,977
Every god awful thing.

709
00:40:17,201 --> 00:40:19,814
Why don't you ask Vic to
show you page one?

710
00:40:21,066 --> 00:40:22,239
He burned it.

711
00:40:23,616 --> 00:40:25,040
You know why?

712
00:40:25,596 --> 00:40:28,632
Because he doesn't want anyone
reading the first paragraph,

713
00:40:28,851 --> 00:40:33,553
about how he shot and killed Terry
while I stood there and watched.

714
00:40:33,653 --> 00:40:38,012
Look, I have been lying, covering up,

715
00:40:38,176 --> 00:40:43,652
bleeding out of my goddamn anus,
man, for 3 years trying to protect him.

716
00:40:45,617 --> 00:40:49,169
If you ever get tired of Vic
walking you around on a leash

717
00:40:49,795 --> 00:40:52,314
and you want to hear the
real and the raw...

718
00:40:53,847 --> 00:40:54,801
Call me.

719
00:41:00,865 --> 00:41:02,571
This building here.

720
00:41:04,027 --> 00:41:06,952
- Are you sure this is right?
- The captain's applied for a warrant.

721
00:41:07,062 --> 00:41:09,859
This place is going to get shut down
tomorrow or the next day.

722
00:41:09,959 --> 00:41:11,521
It's the last chance.

723
00:41:15,073 --> 00:41:17,170
- Hello?
- Hi.

724
00:41:17,382 --> 00:41:20,068
- What you look for?
- My friend said you might know of a place

725
00:41:20,168 --> 00:41:22,325
that might have Fendi clutches?

726
00:41:24,979 --> 00:41:26,387
You come.

727
00:41:35,347 --> 00:41:36,614
Wait.

728
00:41:40,995 --> 00:41:42,403
You come.

729
00:41:49,349 --> 00:41:51,180
- Please, please.
- Ok.

730
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:00,252
- I'm not sure about this.
- Just keep thinking Louis.

731
00:42:00,352 --> 00:42:02,399
Besides, I'm packing.

732
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,847
Look, we deserve it after
the day we had, right?

733
00:42:14,956 --> 00:42:18,239
Hell, yeah. We got pelted with
shitballs this afternoon.

734
00:42:18,339 --> 00:42:21,208
I've had puke all over me
first thing this morning.

735
00:42:21,365 --> 00:42:23,348
We deserve this everyday.

736
00:42:23,448 --> 00:42:26,841
I get new Prada next week. You
come back. I give you good deal.

737
00:42:26,966 --> 00:42:29,375
Next week might not work.

738
00:42:43,551 --> 00:42:45,288
Hernan was a no-show.

739
00:42:46,009 --> 00:42:48,165
He pass along any intel to the girl?

740
00:42:48,265 --> 00:42:50,285
Why the salvas are looking to
beef up their firepower?

741
00:42:50,385 --> 00:42:51,689
No specifics.

742
00:42:51,815 --> 00:42:53,719
Only that something major
was about to go down.

743
00:42:53,819 --> 00:42:56,720
Saw the captains and the Byz Lats,
set a meeting for tomorrow night,

744
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:58,047
negotiate terms.

745
00:42:58,147 --> 00:43:00,459
Now Hernan'll have a seat at the table.
No.

746
00:43:00,788 --> 00:43:03,448
He's on a plane to
El Salvador right now.

747
00:43:03,855 --> 00:43:05,764
Don't know when he's coming back.

748
00:43:05,882 --> 00:43:08,085
Well, there goes our best lead
in the San Marcos case.

749
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:10,889
Which means we went through
all that gun shop bullshit

750
00:43:10,998 --> 00:43:14,659
for no goddamn reason.
Hiatt got in a jam with Claudette.

751
00:43:14,903 --> 00:43:17,277
We're no closer to breaking the
San Marcos murders

752
00:43:17,377 --> 00:43:19,867
or knowing what the salvadorans
are going to do with those guns.

753
00:43:19,967 --> 00:43:22,429
Why would he jerk us off like that?

754
00:43:24,338 --> 00:43:27,342
They sent him to El Salvador
till the heat dies down.

755
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:29,001
Way I see it,

756
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:31,785
Hernan figured that chopped-up
guy is the snitch.

757
00:43:31,897 --> 00:43:35,104
Frame the guy to throw
suspicion off of himself.

758
00:43:35,355 --> 00:43:38,575
Salva bosses had him killed,
made Hernan dump the body.

759
00:43:38,675 --> 00:43:41,238
Hernan did more than
just set this guy up.

760
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:43,616
He did the chopping.

761
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:47,465
He's in all the way now.

762
00:43:47,795 --> 00:43:49,829
Nothing else makes sense.

763
00:43:51,425 --> 00:43:53,787
Well, the guy he got dead
chose the life.

764
00:43:54,069 --> 00:43:55,345
Probably had it coming.

765
00:43:55,445 --> 00:43:58,756
Yeah, but Hernan's going to live
with what he did now.

766
00:43:59,757 --> 00:44:01,682
No different than when you shot Terry.

767
00:44:02,542 --> 00:44:04,435
Had to be done, right?

768
00:44:11,368 --> 00:44:12,609
Shane tell you that?

769
00:44:12,709 --> 00:44:15,968
Page one of Shane's memoirs
wasn't exactly new information.

770
00:44:16,797 --> 00:44:19,660
It's difficult to prove,
fortunately for you.

771
00:44:23,823 --> 00:44:25,919
I wish you'd have been straight with me

772
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:29,503
instead of living a secret every day.
I could have looked out for you better.

773
00:44:32,757 --> 00:44:34,494
What I need to know

774
00:44:34,964 --> 00:44:36,639
is when...

775
00:44:37,718 --> 00:44:40,519
We can finally leave this
all in the past...

776
00:44:41,207 --> 00:44:42,772
Where it belongs.

777
00:45:00,697 --> 00:45:03,338
It's quite a cut job you did
on those 2 black dudes.

778
00:45:03,438 --> 00:45:06,564
Bet the other one pancake and his jewels
are halfway to Alaska by now.

779
00:45:06,673 --> 00:45:08,551
Well, it was maybe too much.

780
00:45:10,735 --> 00:45:13,254
I didn't have time to
make better decision.

781
00:45:13,535 --> 00:45:16,445
Well, I'm certain you
got your point across.

782
00:45:19,473 --> 00:45:21,324
You will also find the
names and addresses

783
00:45:21,424 --> 00:45:24,151
of the men responsible for
what happened at the gas station.

784
00:45:24,708 --> 00:45:26,215
Who are these people?

785
00:45:26,315 --> 00:45:29,344
It doesn't do me much good without
evidence implicating them in the crime.

786
00:45:29,444 --> 00:45:32,390
They're prepared to provide
any details you need.

787
00:45:32,602 --> 00:45:35,794
They're going to confess,
just like that?

788
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,266
No.

789
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:42,553
For the sake of their families
and their children back home.

790
00:45:43,054 --> 00:45:45,636
They know the armenian way,
they suffer first.

791
00:45:48,492 --> 00:45:51,481
That's an honorable first,
giving up your own tribe.

792
00:45:51,653 --> 00:45:54,938
Even if it's your worst enemy,
differences get settled in the house.

793
00:45:55,518 --> 00:45:57,943
You want to cure cancer, you cut it out.

794
00:45:59,414 --> 00:46:02,837
It's only a matter of time before Rezian
finds out your father's out of the game.

795
00:46:02,937 --> 00:46:04,499
If he hadn't already,

796
00:46:04,868 --> 00:46:08,388
and when he does, he's going to come
after you with everything he's got.

797
00:46:08,951 --> 00:46:10,697
And you're not ready for that.

798
00:46:10,797 --> 00:46:13,681
I don't care how many balls you got
dangling from your rearview mirror.

799
00:46:13,781 --> 00:46:16,357
You think this is what I want?
This is for my father.

800
00:46:16,457 --> 00:46:18,602
Oh, come on. Just because your father
was in the life

801
00:46:18,702 --> 00:46:20,905
doesn't mean you have to be
daddy's little gangster.

802
00:46:21,015 --> 00:46:22,986
My father's not a gangster.

803
00:46:23,128 --> 00:46:24,849
He's a man who survives,

804
00:46:24,974 --> 00:46:27,827
who taught me history at the
dinner table every night about Armenia,

805
00:46:27,927 --> 00:46:32,031
about the promises of freedom. All
these promises that were always broken.

806
00:46:32,141 --> 00:46:35,943
He made me understand the difference
between the future and the past.

807
00:46:36,366 --> 00:46:38,807
Everything was taken from my people.

808
00:46:39,433 --> 00:46:42,311
He taught me never to let that
happen to us again.

809
00:46:42,985 --> 00:46:46,505
So, I won't.
I won't let that happen to him.

810
00:46:46,943 --> 00:46:49,447
My father still has a lot
of men loyal to him.

811
00:46:51,676 --> 00:46:53,147
