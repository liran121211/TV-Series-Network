1
00:00:00,164 --> 00:00:01,532
Previously on "The Shield"...

2
00:00:01,565 --> 00:00:02,232
Shane?

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,277
We're going to find out who did this,
and we're gonna kill him.

4
00:00:07,327 --> 00:00:10,019
- Grenades?
- The el salvadorans. Start there.

5
00:00:10,084 --> 00:00:12,612
It's Guardo.
He stepped on his protection plate twice.

6
00:00:12,687 --> 00:00:15,839
Nydia Hernandez? We have information that
someone is planning on kidnapping you.

7
00:00:15,925 --> 00:00:17,426
Well, I should call Guardo and warn him.

8
00:00:17,474 --> 00:00:19,940
No, no, no. We don't know who's
listening on this side of the line.

9
00:00:19,988 --> 00:00:20,975
We have to move you now.

10
00:00:21,022 --> 00:00:22,654
- Come on. We better get going.
- Ok.

11
00:00:22,877 --> 00:00:23,551
What's this?

12
00:00:23,646 --> 00:00:25,801
It's the message I'm waiting on from Guardo.

13
00:00:25,878 --> 00:00:26,617
A necklace.

14
00:00:26,665 --> 00:00:28,602
You tell him that if he ever wants
to see her again,

15
00:00:28,685 --> 00:00:32,360
He has 24 hours to get 50 grand
in person to L.A.

16
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:36,865
Guardo wanted to have you killed.
You made up a story about Vic so that

17
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:40,423
you could get witness protection.
Now, does that sound about right?

18
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,158
I fed her the story.
I framed him. Guilty man.

19
00:00:44,217 --> 00:00:47,539
You're under arrest for interfering
with police business under call of authority.

20
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:50,727
- Case against Vic has been dropped.
- This has turned into a kidnapping.

21
00:00:50,797 --> 00:00:53,427
- Just let Nydia go.
- She's how we're going to get to Guardo.

22
00:00:53,507 --> 00:00:59,789
For every second he gets to breathe,
and Lem doesn't, is unacceptable.

23
00:01:11,012 --> 00:01:12,667
So how come no one's helping you?

24
00:01:12,773 --> 00:01:14,334
Helping me watch you?

25
00:01:14,452 --> 00:01:15,873
I think I can handle it.

26
00:01:22,591 --> 00:01:24,963
- No calls.
- I need to talk to Guardo.

27
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:26,230
The wrong people could be listening.

28
00:01:26,231 --> 00:01:29,631
You could say something that could reveal
your location on a listen.

29
00:01:29,634 --> 00:01:32,252
I talk to him everyday.
He'll get worried if I don't call.

30
00:01:32,287 --> 00:01:36,362
He might lower his guard if you do.
For all we know, this could be an inside threat.

31
00:01:36,416 --> 00:01:40,514
Until we know more, the less he knows
or hears, the safer it'll be.

32
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,344
Besides, he's probably going to
call you at some point.

33
00:01:43,522 --> 00:01:46,551
When he's alone.
Right?

34
00:01:49,628 --> 00:01:50,332
Yeah.

35
00:01:51,514 --> 00:01:53,310
Well, then we'll wait for that call.

36
00:01:55,089 --> 00:01:56,545
Corrine. Hi.

37
00:01:56,834 --> 00:01:59,922
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah. Look, I know it's early,

38
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,274
but I've been meaning to drop off
these hand-me down toys for jackson.

39
00:02:02,264 --> 00:02:04,720
- Mara's expecting them.
- Yeah. Come on in.

40
00:02:05,954 --> 00:02:09,047
- Ahh. Look at him.
- I appreciate this.

41
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:12,706
- I don't want them to go to waste, so...
- They won't. Trust me.

42
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:16,499
Mara's not in the house,
so daddy's stepping up.

43
00:02:16,589 --> 00:02:20,030
- Um, I heard Vic was cleared of all the charges.
- Yeah.

44
00:02:20,135 --> 00:02:23,446
Kavanaugh planted that evidence
in Vic's apartment. Set the whole thing up.

45
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:31,632
I had the door on, when I, um,
told him about all that extra money.

46
00:02:32,924 --> 00:02:34,756
I kept my mouth shut.

47
00:02:35,638 --> 00:02:39,807
- I don't know, maybe Lem...
- Sweetie, no. Lem's not your fault.

48
00:02:41,111 --> 00:02:43,283
If it's anybody's, it's Kavanaugh's.

49
00:02:44,417 --> 00:02:47,094
And you didn't screw up.
You know, he crossed a line.

50
00:02:47,189 --> 00:02:48,856
What's going to happen to Vic now?

51
00:02:49,784 --> 00:02:53,013
- Oh, he's in the clear.
- He's not himself.

52
00:02:53,531 --> 00:02:55,350
Yeah. Well, how can any of us be?

53
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:57,946
He's looking for the person
who killed Lem, right?

54
00:02:58,153 --> 00:02:59,410
He has to be.

55
00:03:01,241 --> 00:03:02,660
What happens if he finds him?

56
00:03:02,825 --> 00:03:05,163
I lost one of my closest and
most dearest friends.

57
00:03:06,193 --> 00:03:09,574
- I'm not going to lose him, too.
- He's always been there.

58
00:03:10,326 --> 00:03:13,226
The kids, they're so connected to him.

59
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:15,359
Now it feels like all that's changed.

60
00:03:15,641 --> 00:03:19,574
It hasn't changed.
It won't. I won't let it.

61
00:03:21,511 --> 00:03:22,451
Promise.

62
00:03:25,054 --> 00:03:27,907
- Why am I trusting you?
- If you care about Guardo,

63
00:03:28,002 --> 00:03:31,959
You'll play it my way. Otherwise, you'll
lead him right to this killer Salceda.

64
00:03:32,053 --> 00:03:34,965
- I never even heard of Salceda.
- There's no reason you would.

65
00:03:35,141 --> 00:03:38,100
He wants Guardo's business.
He'll eliminate him to get it.

66
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:40,808
Guardo's strong.
Nobody can get to him.

67
00:03:40,926 --> 00:03:44,456
Not even the cartel?
Salceda's mexican.

68
00:03:44,539 --> 00:03:47,625
You really think anybody's going to
complain when a salvadoran gets replaced

69
00:03:47,626 --> 00:03:48,626
by one of their own?

70
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,131
- Guardo can take care of himself.
- Maybe I should let him do that then.

71
00:03:52,554 --> 00:03:56,464
Your boyfriend gets killed, it's
one less piece of shit I have to scoop up.

72
00:03:56,534 --> 00:03:59,012
One more murder notch for Salceda.

73
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:03,675
Where you going?

74
00:04:04,486 --> 00:04:06,271
- The bathroom.
- Fine.

75
00:04:06,835 --> 00:04:08,126
Leave the phone.

76
00:04:09,936 --> 00:04:13,998
Uh, the guy's the store manager.
The other 2 are pharmacy tech and a cashier.

77
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:17,046
- Looks fresh.
- Suspects came in as soon as the doors opened,

78
00:04:17,435 --> 00:04:19,114
those 2 were the only ones in the place.

79
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:22,754
Took the employees in the back, shot'em, and
then cleared the ephedrine out of this locked case.

80
00:04:22,809 --> 00:04:25,486
- It's not the most original crime in the world.
- Meth heads.

81
00:04:25,591 --> 00:04:27,446
You know, shred 'em.
Wanting to plan this much on destruction.

82
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,360
- That's one theory.
- You got another?

83
00:04:30,383 --> 00:04:33,154
Used to be these smash and grabs
were just users wanting a fix.

84
00:04:33,201 --> 00:04:35,044
Now, that ephedrine's so locked down,

85
00:04:35,103 --> 00:04:37,076
just as likely to be cookers
needing ingredients.

86
00:04:37,183 --> 00:04:39,424
Yeah, well, in either case we're waiting
for the owner to come down

87
00:04:39,425 --> 00:04:40,725
and then we'll see how much they got.

88
00:04:40,801 --> 00:04:43,384
That's second multiple murder in a week.

89
00:04:43,607 --> 00:04:45,908
Wonder what the brass is going to think
about my body count.

90
00:04:45,991 --> 00:04:47,588
Would be nice to close it.

91
00:04:48,841 --> 00:04:50,531
Spoken like a true captain.

92
00:04:51,518 --> 00:04:52,704
Hey, Dutch?

93
00:04:53,549 --> 00:04:55,979
- I owe you an apology.
- For what?

94
00:04:56,269 --> 00:04:58,582
For not embracing this partnership sooner.

95
00:04:58,969 --> 00:05:01,412
The truth is, we're on the verge of becoming
a damn good team.

96
00:05:02,216 --> 00:05:04,541
Well, I'm still making up my mind.

97
00:05:05,153 --> 00:05:08,370
Well, if you think about it, your weaknesses
are my strength, and Viceversa.

98
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:12,799
And, uh, what exactly are
my weaknesses, Steve?

99
00:05:17,092 --> 00:05:18,219
Arrogance,

100
00:05:18,536 --> 00:05:21,847
overconfidence, the inability to give
credit to those around you.

101
00:05:22,282 --> 00:05:25,264
- Come on. I'm not tellin'ya anything you don't already know.
- Anything else?

102
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:32,454
You're afraid Cardera was the better detective
and you were just drafting off of her,

103
00:05:32,607 --> 00:05:35,824
so you treat me like a piece of shit
because if we start tanking,

104
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:38,160
you can paint me as the guy
that dragged you down.

105
00:05:42,764 --> 00:05:44,161
Hey, you asked.

106
00:05:51,211 --> 00:05:54,170
Got me rattlin' this whole plan.
Right out of my head.

107
00:05:54,299 --> 00:05:56,424
And I think we should just step back
from this whole thing.

108
00:05:56,717 --> 00:05:59,113
Just from the girlfriend,
just for a little while.

109
00:05:59,841 --> 00:06:02,882
- Step back.
- You were just cleared. We were all in the clear

110
00:06:02,932 --> 00:06:05,151
for the first time in a very long time, man.

111
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:08,145
Lettin' Lem's death go unanswered
isn't being in the clear.

112
00:06:09,566 --> 00:06:12,149
Besides, the night is in play.
We're down the road.

113
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:14,393
Tell 'em we found the guy who's trying
to kill Guardo.

114
00:06:14,522 --> 00:06:16,776
We'll put a little distance
between us and her.

115
00:06:17,395 --> 00:06:20,342
Wait for Guardo to get back in the country.
That's when we make our move, in a month or two.

116
00:06:20,377 --> 00:06:24,440
Guardo killed Lem or knows who did.
I'm not scheduling payback for

117
00:06:24,535 --> 00:06:25,614
later in the year.

118
00:06:25,615 --> 00:06:27,987
I'm just talking about lettin'
the dust settle, man.

119
00:06:29,226 --> 00:06:32,326
The public doesn't want this case solved
because it opens old wounds.

120
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,009
Now, they hung Lem out to the press
as a dirty cop.

121
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,428
That makes us the only ones
who care enough to make it right.

122
00:06:37,496 --> 00:06:41,441
They got nowhere on the investigation.
Now Claudette's assigning it to new cases.

123
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,108
We owe it to Lem.

124
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:44,775
It's on us.

125
00:06:47,623 --> 00:06:49,196
Guardo might call anytime.
Go back to the Barn.

126
00:06:49,446 --> 00:06:52,675
Try to get us some heavier firepower.
We might need it.

127
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,106
I'm supposed to have the day off.
What if Claudette asks?

128
00:06:55,247 --> 00:06:56,879
Just picking up more of Lem's stuff.

129
00:06:57,937 --> 00:06:59,416
Let's get this straight.

130
00:07:00,051 --> 00:07:01,484
We need the truth.

131
00:07:02,446 --> 00:07:05,030
This thing's going to get a lot uglier
before it gets better.

132
00:07:18,778 --> 00:07:21,654
Shooters. Let's call 'em early 30s.

133
00:07:22,224 --> 00:07:25,806
Doesn't look like they're tweaking.
Make copies of this, gave it to all the units.

134
00:07:26,158 --> 00:07:28,811
Owner thinks they got away with
some soap and ephedrine.

135
00:07:28,954 --> 00:07:33,041
Couple of white guys. One of them has tats.
See if they're arians, bikers, one of them.

136
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:43,458
- Something else?
- This feels like a strike team case to me.

137
00:07:43,753 --> 00:07:47,839
Drug world. Why not hand it off to them
and put me back on the Lemansky murder?

138
00:07:48,045 --> 00:07:51,121
- I thought you hit a dead-end there?
- Looks like Guardo's out of the country,

139
00:07:51,157 --> 00:07:54,468
but a name keeps popping up in
my interviews. Hernan.

140
00:07:54,546 --> 00:07:58,256
- Hernan. Connected?
- Don't know. But several salvadorans mentioned him.

141
00:07:58,427 --> 00:08:02,724
It's like a ghost. Leads me to believe he's either
got something to hide, he's smart, or both.

142
00:08:02,838 --> 00:08:05,586
The strike team's been on the sideline
since Lemansky's death.

143
00:08:06,114 --> 00:08:07,933
If you hear something on Hernan,
let me know.

144
00:08:07,993 --> 00:08:11,234
Otherwise, try to clear this
pharmacy murder quick.

145
00:08:16,802 --> 00:08:20,477
- You two still work here?
- Taking some personal days. Sent you the memo.

146
00:08:20,548 --> 00:08:22,990
- What about you?
- I used mine up on the wisdom teeth.

147
00:08:23,073 --> 00:08:26,396
- As long as you're still on the clock, I need you.
- I'll just put these on the truck.

148
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,359
- Just came by to get some things of Lem's.
- Saves me having to ask.

149
00:08:31,429 --> 00:08:33,648
We're short of lockers. I'm going to need his
when it's ready.

150
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,797
- I'll have it cleared out by tomorrow.
- How's Vic doing?

151
00:08:36,404 --> 00:08:39,023
- He lost a friend.
- I understand.

152
00:08:39,205 --> 00:08:41,741
- He still hasn't returned my calls.
- Well, he's been off-duty.

153
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:46,555
As soon as he can, I want him back at work
and I don't mean on the Lemansky killing either.

154
00:08:46,598 --> 00:08:48,582
- You don't have to worry about that.
- Good. And...

155
00:08:48,618 --> 00:08:52,798
if he thinks he can avoid my warnings by
ducking calls, tell him as far as I'm concerned,

156
00:08:52,856 --> 00:08:54,030
he just got it.

157
00:08:55,225 --> 00:08:57,796
- Have Ronnie find me.
- Hey, Dutch!

158
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:02,399
I don't know what this tattoo is,
but it doesn't match anything on the books.

159
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:06,528
Not arian nation.
Looks like some kind of bird.

160
00:09:06,903 --> 00:09:09,569
Can't i.d. the tats.
Might be gang, but I doubt it.

161
00:09:10,446 --> 00:09:11,315
Ronnie.

162
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:14,509
This is one of the suspects
in the pharmacy shooting.

163
00:09:14,567 --> 00:09:16,117
- You know him?
- No.

164
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,527
What about the tattoo?

165
00:09:18,314 --> 00:09:20,615
Military. Navy, I think.

166
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:23,997
A lot of these assholes first get
hooked up on it for Uncle Sam.

167
00:09:24,277 --> 00:09:26,989
Armed forces second only to the joint
as a recruitment center.

168
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:28,938
Stay with this one with
Dutch and Steve.

169
00:09:29,008 --> 00:09:32,272
We got 3 dead already.
I want them before they need more supplies.

170
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,470
Ok.

171
00:09:35,561 --> 00:09:37,070
I don't need another person to baby-sit.

172
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:40,810
You were the one that said this
was a strike team case.

173
00:09:40,898 --> 00:09:43,106
You got your wish.
Besides, keep your ears open,

174
00:09:43,272 --> 00:09:46,759
if Mackey and Vendrell are looking for
Lemansky's killer, like I think they are,

175
00:09:46,842 --> 00:09:50,282
- might get one of it through Ronnie. Let me know.
- Ok.

176
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:58,180
Answer it.

177
00:10:01,561 --> 00:10:02,630
- Hello?
- Nydia?

178
00:10:06,754 --> 00:10:09,795
- Give me that back!
- I need to talk to him.

179
00:10:10,172 --> 00:10:11,558
Please. Just for a minute.

180
00:10:13,302 --> 00:10:16,754
You said you wanted to protect him.
To save his life, right?

181
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:19,527
You got to do things my way.
Remember?

182
00:10:31,623 --> 00:10:32,481
Talk.

183
00:10:32,654 --> 00:10:34,219
You know who I am, asshole?

184
00:10:34,281 --> 00:10:36,362
She's still alive. For now.

185
00:10:36,409 --> 00:10:38,709
That's the last time
you get to hear her voice.

186
00:10:41,525 --> 00:10:43,465
You're a gringo. Who's this?

187
00:10:43,587 --> 00:10:45,229
Are you mob? Russian?

188
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:48,468
I'm the guy that decides
whether Nydia lives or dies.

189
00:10:48,609 --> 00:10:50,424
And who her last lover is.

190
00:10:50,641 --> 00:10:53,817
- You touch her, you're dead.
- Oh, you got that all turned around.

191
00:10:54,724 --> 00:10:57,384
If I don't see you with
the money, she dies.

192
00:10:57,922 --> 00:11:00,159
But not until she feels
my soft touch.

193
00:11:00,237 --> 00:11:01,057
Stupid bitch.

194
00:11:01,058 --> 00:11:02,803
Next word out of your mouth
better be 'when'.

195
00:11:02,892 --> 00:11:05,693
Or I will rape and kill that
bitch while you're listening.

196
00:11:07,172 --> 00:11:07,720
When?

197
00:11:09,222 --> 00:11:10,098
Where are you?

198
00:11:10,786 --> 00:11:11,725
Near the border.

199
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:14,307
MacArthur Park.

200
00:11:14,448 --> 00:11:17,753
The trash can by the lake.
Southeast corner. You got that?

201
00:11:19,306 --> 00:11:19,766
Yeah.

202
00:11:20,517 --> 00:11:21,804
How soon can you be there?

203
00:11:22,067 --> 00:11:25,413
- Tomorrow. Maybe the next day.
- I know your business.

204
00:11:26,324 --> 00:11:27,629
You protect things.

205
00:11:28,507 --> 00:11:30,826
What do you think the cartel's
going to think when they find out

206
00:11:30,871 --> 00:11:33,782
you can't even protect
your own personal piece of ass?

207
00:11:34,895 --> 00:11:37,900
- I can be there in 3 hours.
- Come alone.

208
00:11:38,388 --> 00:11:41,393
Once I know I got the 50 grand,
I'll let you know where you can find the girl.

209
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,082
You don't come by yourself, she dies

210
00:11:44,261 --> 00:11:46,524
and your protection business
along with her.

211
00:11:47,116 --> 00:11:50,196
- All right. We're on. Did you bring that back-up?
- Yeah,

212
00:11:50,402 --> 00:11:51,594
but I lost Ronnie.

213
00:11:52,176 --> 00:11:54,984
He blew through his goddamn
personal days on his teeth.

214
00:11:56,671 --> 00:11:58,737
We're meeting with Guardo in 3 hours.

215
00:12:00,784 --> 00:12:02,296
Just because Guardo's coming

216
00:12:02,352 --> 00:12:04,887
doesn't mean he's not going
to try to set us up, too.

217
00:12:05,314 --> 00:12:08,272
We'll go to the drop-off point early.
Make sure there's no trap.

218
00:12:11,943 --> 00:12:14,882
I have a call into an
agent Jordan Zinman

219
00:12:15,098 --> 00:12:17,662
About a salvadoran named Hernan.

220
00:12:18,484 --> 00:12:22,277
It's important. He may be a material witness
in the murder of a policeman.

221
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,901
Ok. Just tell him I called.

222
00:12:28,319 --> 00:12:30,450
Give it to him.
Just followed my military hunch.

223
00:12:30,503 --> 00:12:32,390
Checked navy records of guys
who lost their benefits

224
00:12:32,437 --> 00:12:34,616
for felony conViction
against known L.A. Residents.

225
00:12:34,682 --> 00:12:37,273
- Slide it over the fence.
- We can wrap this up by dinner.

226
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:40,240
The only thing bigger than Wym's body
count's going to be our closure rate.

227
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:46,616
No access to the back, so go
around the side, cover the rear.

228
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,020
- You ready?
- Everyone stay behind me.

229
00:13:02,224 --> 00:13:03,127
Tommy, is that you?

230
00:13:03,151 --> 00:13:04,994
I have an arrest warrant for
Tom Franklin. Is he here?

231
00:13:05,246 --> 00:13:07,707
- Oh, jesus christ.
- Is he here?!

232
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:09,256
- What is this?
- House is clear.

233
00:13:09,441 --> 00:13:10,258
Where is he?

234
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:13,535
He works out in the garage a lot.
Maybe back there.

235
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:15,009
Let's go. Coming out!

236
00:13:18,136 --> 00:13:18,731
Go there!

237
00:13:33,319 --> 00:13:34,437
Not here.

238
00:13:36,587 --> 00:13:38,944
Dry ice. No fumes.

239
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,057
All right. We're clear.

240
00:13:45,494 --> 00:13:47,832
- Who are you?
- His sister.

241
00:13:47,957 --> 00:13:50,445
- Lisa.
- You know your brother was cooking meth out here?

242
00:13:50,554 --> 00:13:53,474
- Said he was fixing up an old car.
- Did you see him this morning?

243
00:13:53,568 --> 00:13:56,282
- He was gone before I woke up.
- How can we find him?

244
00:13:57,671 --> 00:14:00,657
- Your brother killed 3 people today.
- Oh.

245
00:14:01,005 --> 00:14:03,962
If he's not here,
who's going to take care of me?

246
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:13,958
If Guardo's been in Mexico,

247
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:17,695
- what if he was there when Lem died?
- He ordered it and he knows who did it.

248
00:14:17,784 --> 00:14:21,117
- How are we going to know that for sure?
- He'll give that up for his life.

249
00:14:24,685 --> 00:14:28,811
- Nydia comfortable in the van?
- She's excited about her big reunion.

250
00:14:30,595 --> 00:14:31,740
You gonna check on her?

251
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,675
Just don't want her
getting too curious.

252
00:14:36,022 --> 00:14:37,919
Guardo's still 2 hours out.

253
00:14:39,472 --> 00:14:40,796
We'll do a head count now.

254
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,139
See if the population gets any browner
over the next couple of hours.

255
00:14:45,237 --> 00:14:49,059
Corinne came by this morning.
Brought some toys for jackson.

256
00:14:52,295 --> 00:14:54,793
But she really came by because
she's worried about you.

257
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:57,994
About what you're going to do.

258
00:15:00,097 --> 00:15:01,684
Where that leaves the kids.

259
00:15:03,816 --> 00:15:05,112
She mention the kids?

260
00:15:06,351 --> 00:15:07,093
Yeah.

261
00:15:10,886 --> 00:15:13,572
When we finish up with Guardo,
I'll drop by.

262
00:15:15,853 --> 00:15:18,313
Maybe we should check on the girl.

263
00:15:31,424 --> 00:15:33,095
Tom Franklin's sister...

264
00:15:33,292 --> 00:15:35,611
Won't or can't give up her brother.

265
00:15:35,746 --> 00:15:38,131
- Any idea on the other suspect?
- Not yet.

266
00:15:39,427 --> 00:15:43,033
- Hello, sergeant. Welcome back.
- Thanks.

267
00:15:43,133 --> 00:15:46,344
- We got another pharmacy robbery on western.
- Anyone hurt?

268
00:15:46,682 --> 00:15:49,217
Just medicine cabinets. Took all
the ephedrine in the store.

269
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,126
Get out there, see what you can find.

270
00:15:51,856 --> 00:15:52,720
Here we go.

271
00:15:54,044 --> 00:15:54,823
Claudette?

272
00:15:56,391 --> 00:15:58,250
- This is Skip Osaka.
- Hi.

273
00:15:58,363 --> 00:16:01,771
Department hired him to take some
publicity pictures of personnel.

274
00:16:02,191 --> 00:16:04,416
I thought the department
had that handled already.

275
00:16:05,515 --> 00:16:08,538
You know, why don't you get started.
Your pass gives you full access.

276
00:16:08,642 --> 00:16:11,156
Thanks. Is there someplace I can
set up my equipment?

277
00:16:11,219 --> 00:16:12,423
Pick an open desk.

278
00:16:14,232 --> 00:16:17,669
After Lemansky, they thought it was a
good idea the department get some good PR

279
00:16:17,744 --> 00:16:21,068
We both want this place to survive, so
I made sure the Barn gets its shot, too.

280
00:16:21,139 --> 00:16:24,501
The only good publicity I need
is lower crime stats.

281
00:16:24,895 --> 00:16:26,398
This campaign won't hurt.

282
00:16:27,073 --> 00:16:29,111
Now, as a reservist, they want
some pictures of me

283
00:16:29,158 --> 00:16:30,867
in uniform, as well.
Maybe some of you, too.

284
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:32,928
I'll work with him.

285
00:16:47,127 --> 00:16:48,666
You see the 2 carloads?

286
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:52,056
- They circled twice. They're hard to miss.
- We need an army, Vic.

287
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,554
With the shit these guys might
be packing, I'm talking literally.

288
00:16:54,601 --> 00:16:56,732
I still don't know if Guardo's in town.

289
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:58,920
We'll wait and make sure.

290
00:17:01,066 --> 00:17:03,460
He rounded all the employees
and customers up

291
00:17:03,544 --> 00:17:06,568
and brought 'em to the back, and
then broke into the drug cabinets.

292
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:09,587
He only took the ephedrine. Left everything else.
He didn't even try the register.

293
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:11,240
Just like this morning. Who's this?

294
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:14,070
That's Leticia Everett.
She's the assistant manager.

295
00:17:14,165 --> 00:17:14,991
Good job.

296
00:17:15,366 --> 00:17:18,503
Hi, Leticia.
Is this the man that robbed you?

297
00:17:18,578 --> 00:17:20,493
- One of them.
- What did the other guy look like?

298
00:17:20,766 --> 00:17:24,137
He was a white guy, too. Kind of looked
like that one. They could've been brothers.

299
00:17:24,494 --> 00:17:26,034
You see the girl that came in?

300
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:29,339
Are these the same guys that killed
those other people this morning?

301
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,115
Maybe.

302
00:17:30,528 --> 00:17:33,880
- Why didn't they kill us?
- Stick around, ok? We may need you a little more.

303
00:17:35,297 --> 00:17:38,715
- It's pretty crowded in here.
- Yeah. Probably didn't have enough bullets.

304
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:41,457
I need to take this.

305
00:17:42,443 --> 00:17:43,654
- Yeah?
- He's good.

306
00:17:44,847 --> 00:17:46,415
Broke the thing damn open.

307
00:17:49,321 --> 00:17:51,678
- Hey, you still on that Claudette thing?
- Hip-deep.

308
00:17:52,059 --> 00:17:54,510
I've been trying to get in touch
with our mexican federali

309
00:17:54,557 --> 00:17:56,773
see if Guardo's really crossing
the border or not.

310
00:17:57,054 --> 00:18:00,294
- You on a wire connection?
- No, I'm in the middle of something.

311
00:18:00,341 --> 00:18:03,477
Man. I'm in a real vacuum here. Can't you
break away for a couple of seconds?

312
00:18:03,627 --> 00:18:06,125
- When I can, I will.
- All right.

313
00:18:06,209 --> 00:18:08,341
- Let me know when things free up.
- Ok.

314
00:18:10,446 --> 00:18:11,159
Gardocki.

315
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,347
Thanks.

316
00:18:13,797 --> 00:18:15,333
Anything interesting?

317
00:18:15,549 --> 00:18:18,192
Tom Franklin came home.
Unis grabbed him up

318
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,381
and they're taking him
to the barn.

319
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:20,460
Hey!

320
00:18:20,544 --> 00:18:23,718
Your buddy's got all the ephedrine,
left you holding the bill.

321
00:18:23,947 --> 00:18:26,295
He's got a knack for
avoiding the cameras.

322
00:18:28,221 --> 00:18:31,629
So all we got is you
committing armed robbery

323
00:18:31,739 --> 00:18:33,110
and 3 dead bodies.

324
00:18:33,211 --> 00:18:36,791
The Berkley law grads and the D.A.'s office
are going to be tearing

325
00:18:36,853 --> 00:18:39,371
each other's eyes out
to get this case.

326
00:18:41,769 --> 00:18:43,760
What if I said he killed
those people?

327
00:18:45,629 --> 00:18:51,281
Well, that's, uh...that's a start. I'd
like to think that's the truth here.

328
00:18:53,577 --> 00:18:54,863
He's my cousin.

329
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:58,095
Bobby.
It was his idea.

330
00:18:58,198 --> 00:19:01,306
He made a deal with some dude in
the horde to cook up 20 pounds of meth.

331
00:19:01,353 --> 00:19:03,147
We never made that much before.

332
00:19:03,931 --> 00:19:06,795
Bobby knew some mexican who was
going to get us the ephedrine from over there.

333
00:19:06,865 --> 00:19:10,199
- What happened?
- He showed up with a bunch of plants.

334
00:19:10,847 --> 00:19:14,133
- So ephedrine goes wild down there.
- What the hell are we supposed to do with plants?

335
00:19:14,246 --> 00:19:18,255
- So you started killing people?
- I told Bobby to back out of the deal.

336
00:19:18,496 --> 00:19:20,533
But he got paid in advance,

337
00:19:21,415 --> 00:19:24,251
blew most of his money
on a harley and some new pussy.

338
00:19:24,335 --> 00:19:27,622
- And left you out to dry with the horde.
- No shit.

339
00:19:28,388 --> 00:19:30,349
Ripping up those pharmacies was
the only shot we had

340
00:19:30,411 --> 00:19:31,851
to cook up enough shit in time.

341
00:19:32,585 --> 00:19:35,458
But I didn't know he was going to
kill those people, 'til I heard the shot.

342
00:19:35,505 --> 00:19:36,519
How do we find him?

343
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:40,041
His new pussy lived in Van Nuys.
If he's anywhere, he's

344
00:19:40,116 --> 00:19:42,051
messing up the sheets with her.

345
00:19:51,247 --> 00:19:53,125
- Yeah?
- We got him.

346
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,390
- Stay here.
- Again?

347
00:20:01,522 --> 00:20:05,484
For your own safety, ok?
Trust me? Stay down.

348
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:17,151
Just like a bee to honey.

349
00:20:17,648 --> 00:20:19,554
- You got the money?
- Yeah.

350
00:20:19,907 --> 00:20:24,273
- He's got 2 guys between us and him.
- Luckily I don't give a shit about the cash.

351
00:20:24,696 --> 00:20:27,230
He knows he's got the heat on him
so he's got a safe place to stay

352
00:20:27,284 --> 00:20:28,527
until this thing is done.

353
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:32,856
- Well, what if he's not there alone?
- He's worried about his reputation.

354
00:20:32,968 --> 00:20:35,550
He's going to make sure
he gets to those kidnappers.

355
00:20:36,044 --> 00:20:39,255
The more guys he puts staking out
the money, the better his chances are.

356
00:20:39,725 --> 00:20:42,673
- Well, I've still got Nydia in the truck.
- Take her back home.

357
00:20:43,053 --> 00:20:44,941
I'll follow Guardo back to his hole.

358
00:20:45,138 --> 00:20:48,584
I figure we've got a half-hour before
his guys start to get suspicious.

359
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,166
Just call me when you get the location.

360
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:53,016
- If there's time.
- I'm serious.

361
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,580
Don't make a move until I can be there
to back you up, all right?

362
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,059
Just get the girl back.

363
00:21:08,779 --> 00:21:10,771
- Found Guardo.
- That's a relief.

364
00:21:10,845 --> 00:21:13,441
Last chance.
I could use you.

365
00:21:13,494 --> 00:21:16,784
We're on a stakeout now. The guy
should be showing up anytime.

366
00:21:17,044 --> 00:21:20,290
- Our window's closing. I'll call you later.
- Ok. Be sure and do that.

367
00:21:25,162 --> 00:21:26,356
Everything ok?

368
00:21:27,463 --> 00:21:29,086
Be a lot better if Bobby showed up.

369
00:21:30,358 --> 00:21:33,869
How's... How's Vic doing,
by the way?

370
00:21:34,149 --> 00:21:36,878
He's ok. I talked to him yesterday.
He's...

371
00:21:37,235 --> 00:21:40,082
- dealing with things his own way.
- Sure.

372
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:45,019
I was the first one to see
the holes in Kavanaugh's story.

373
00:21:51,052 --> 00:21:52,885
Let's get ready to move.

374
00:21:53,785 --> 00:21:55,467
Turn around, asshole.

375
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:57,099
That's him. Move. Move!

376
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:04,042
Hey!

377
00:22:05,588 --> 00:22:06,355
Hey!

378
00:22:07,491 --> 00:22:08,553
Get off of him!

379
00:22:09,485 --> 00:22:10,502
Hey, hey, hey!

380
00:22:11,135 --> 00:22:12,127
Roll over.

381
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,104
Roll over.

382
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:17,777
Now you'll roll over.

383
00:22:19,984 --> 00:22:22,623
- Hold still, asshole.
- Get up!

384
00:23:01,903 --> 00:23:04,426
Right there!
Right there.

385
00:23:09,897 --> 00:23:11,037
Officer.

386
00:23:11,903 --> 00:23:13,825
You're not going to find
anything here.

387
00:23:21,459 --> 00:23:22,963
I found what I want.

388
00:23:27,443 --> 00:23:28,805
Nydia?

389
00:23:30,293 --> 00:23:33,491
I brought the money.
I did what you said.

390
00:23:33,554 --> 00:23:35,929
You leave your guys at the park
as a welcome wagon?

391
00:23:40,456 --> 00:23:42,150
Too bad. You could have
used them.

392
00:23:51,441 --> 00:23:54,203
What happened?
Where's Guardo? Your friend?

393
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:57,717
Salceda was hiding at
Guardo's place. Vic's taking him in.

394
00:23:57,796 --> 00:24:00,725
So where's Guardo?
You said he was back in town.

395
00:24:00,808 --> 00:24:05,082
Well, I guess the rumor was just that.
Good news is Salceda believed it.

396
00:24:05,176 --> 00:24:10,132
- He fell right into our trap.
- So, he's safe? We're safe again?

397
00:24:10,718 --> 00:24:11,876
Yeah.

398
00:24:19,112 --> 00:24:21,629
- Thank you.
- Yeah, good luck.

399
00:24:23,441 --> 00:24:24,977
Don't judge me.

400
00:24:25,832 --> 00:24:26,877
I'm not.

401
00:24:28,347 --> 00:24:29,931
It's just, um...

402
00:24:31,324 --> 00:24:32,780
I'm pregnant.

403
00:24:34,693 --> 00:24:35,659
A month.

404
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,493
I haven't told Guardo yet.

405
00:24:39,648 --> 00:24:42,007
That's why I quit smoking.

406
00:24:43,004 --> 00:24:45,522
Just thought that if I hadn't
it would hurt the baby, right?

407
00:24:45,852 --> 00:24:46,612
No.

408
00:24:47,768 --> 00:24:48,480
No.

409
00:24:49,937 --> 00:24:52,486
I just want my baby
to know his father.

410
00:24:53,578 --> 00:24:54,290
Yeah.

411
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:10,669
We recovered the stolen ephedrine
from the house, and the murder weapon.

412
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,147
Music to my ears.

413
00:25:12,328 --> 00:25:14,076
Ron, you did a great job out there.

414
00:25:14,178 --> 00:25:16,277
He trusts the instincts of
the people he works with.

415
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,232
So, i guess we're done, right?

416
00:25:18,409 --> 00:25:19,540
Let's get back out there.

417
00:25:20,901 --> 00:25:22,436
What about the horde?

418
00:25:22,775 --> 00:25:23,905
What about them?

419
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:27,313
Well, the cousins are still supposed
to give them the meth, right?

420
00:25:27,426 --> 00:25:28,492
There is no meth.

421
00:25:28,649 --> 00:25:33,236
We're not going to make a deal on a trio
of homicides just to get us some dealers.

422
00:25:33,769 --> 00:25:34,593
Wait.

423
00:25:34,786 --> 00:25:37,975
The horde doesn't know there's no meth.
Bobby's the contact,

424
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:42,239
say we offered them leniency for
his cousin who wasn't the shooter.

425
00:25:42,368 --> 00:25:45,000
- Maybe they'd go for it.
- He killed 3 people.

426
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:46,676
Let's just turn it over to the D.A.

427
00:25:46,741 --> 00:25:50,972
The horde's an impossible crew to crack
because nobody wants to be the enemy, right?

428
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,825
We could bust them in a lot of ways.

429
00:25:53,002 --> 00:25:56,410
And if they don't get what they want,
they're just going to find another cooker,

430
00:25:56,507 --> 00:25:57,363
won't they?

431
00:25:57,492 --> 00:25:58,768
We'll use Bobby.

432
00:25:58,897 --> 00:26:02,699
Go through the exchangeas planned.
The horde doesn't know what Tom looks like,

433
00:26:02,812 --> 00:26:05,105
so we'll give them you instead.

434
00:26:30,717 --> 00:26:32,163
What do you want?

435
00:26:32,482 --> 00:26:35,680
I can get the money back.
10 times that.

436
00:27:01,889 --> 00:27:06,055
Take me to a police station.
I won't say anything without a lawyer.

437
00:27:36,298 --> 00:27:37,865
What do you want?

438
00:27:40,702 --> 00:27:42,737
You killed my friend a week ago.

439
00:27:43,012 --> 00:27:45,773
You tossed a grenade in his car.
Blew his guts out.

440
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:47,405
I don't know anything about that.

441
00:27:47,545 --> 00:27:49,936
I want to know how you found him.
Who led you to him?

442
00:27:50,033 --> 00:27:51,115
It wasn't me.

443
00:27:51,228 --> 00:27:54,474
Then you know who did it
because you gave the order.

444
00:27:54,926 --> 00:27:56,234
Where's Nydia?

445
00:27:56,788 --> 00:28:00,018
- Did you harm her?
- His name was Curtis Lemansky.

446
00:28:00,874 --> 00:28:02,215
He was a good cop.

447
00:28:02,877 --> 00:28:05,752
He was my friend and you killed him.

448
00:28:06,486 --> 00:28:08,650
All i want is to hear you say it.

449
00:28:08,989 --> 00:28:13,091
I've been in Mexico for 2 weeks.
I wasn't near no cop getting killed.

450
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:21,743
- Your friend is making a mistake.
- You're going to tell me how he got killed

451
00:28:21,916 --> 00:28:27,262
or you're going to tellme who did it. Either way,
you're not leaving this place until i know every detail.

452
00:28:27,618 --> 00:28:30,444
I don't know anything.
I told you.

453
00:28:31,589 --> 00:28:34,738
Maybe Nydia can help you
remember something.

454
00:28:35,425 --> 00:28:36,361
Don't hurt her.

455
00:28:36,442 --> 00:28:39,818
Don't make us hurt her, man.
Just tell him what he wants to know.

456
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:43,777
Get her undressed.

457
00:28:46,243 --> 00:28:47,406
All right!

458
00:28:51,945 --> 00:28:54,480
It was Lino. Lino prieto.

459
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:56,946
You gave him the order.
I didn't give any order.

460
00:28:57,027 --> 00:28:58,739
I heard about it in Mexico.

461
00:28:59,078 --> 00:29:00,855
My people were pissed off.

462
00:29:01,081 --> 00:29:03,713
Asshole brought a lot of shit down
on us without getting exemption.

463
00:29:03,794 --> 00:29:04,989
How'd he find my guy?

464
00:29:05,116 --> 00:29:06,134
Ask him.

465
00:29:07,071 --> 00:29:10,349
Prieto is the ones hould be hanging here.
Not me.

466
00:29:11,334 --> 00:29:14,419
If you're telling the truth, he will be.

467
00:29:27,051 --> 00:29:29,619
- Yeah?
- Pull up everything you've got on Lino Prieto.

468
00:29:29,732 --> 00:29:30,927
I'm on it now.

469
00:29:31,128 --> 00:29:33,244
- What happened to Guardo?
- He's at the place with Shane.

470
00:29:33,357 --> 00:29:35,344
- What'd he say?
- He had nothing to do with it.

471
00:29:35,442 --> 00:29:38,284
That this guy Prieto went off the grid
and acted on his own.

472
00:29:39,269 --> 00:29:40,804
Did you need something?

473
00:29:41,175 --> 00:29:43,452
- Yeah, it's time to go.
- I'll be right there.

474
00:29:43,598 --> 00:29:45,601
- Desk boy still hounding you?
- Yep.

475
00:29:46,194 --> 00:29:50,087
If Shane's with him, how'she going to meet you?
Flying solo on this one.

476
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:53,531
1731 Charles street.
Apartment 6.

477
00:29:53,886 --> 00:29:56,955
Why don't you wait? Wait, i'll get
freed upon this, and i'll meet you.

478
00:29:57,246 --> 00:29:59,555
Can't slow down.
Call me later.

479
00:30:01,195 --> 00:30:03,698
Sorry to keep everybody waiting.

480
00:30:17,334 --> 00:30:18,287
I'm a cop.

481
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,468
Lino Prieto?

482
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:22,519
I'm his brother, Roberto.

483
00:30:22,632 --> 00:30:25,588
Let me see some I.D.
Right now. Come on.

484
00:30:33,035 --> 00:30:34,295
Where's your brother at?

485
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:35,797
He's in jail.

486
00:30:35,991 --> 00:30:37,864
Jail.
Since when?

487
00:30:38,009 --> 00:30:42,095
Been almost a month.
I told you, Lino ain't here.

488
00:30:42,427 --> 00:30:44,494
That's his wife, Margie,
these are his kids.

489
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:49,372
So, your brother goes to jail and you
come over here to keep his wife company?

490
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:51,504
I came over to check on them,
that's all.

491
00:30:51,628 --> 00:30:54,567
Guardo Lima says that your brother
killed a friend of mine.

492
00:30:54,697 --> 00:30:55,472
A cop.

493
00:30:55,569 --> 00:30:58,072
- Guardo's a lying asshole.
- Doesn't mean it's not true.

494
00:30:58,153 --> 00:31:01,415
My brother was stupid to get in it again,
but he wouldn't kill anybody.

495
00:31:01,473 --> 00:31:02,620
What's he in lock-up for?

496
00:31:02,701 --> 00:31:06,141
Got drunk, stole a car,
crashed it into a store.

497
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,749
Why would Guardo give me
your brother's name?

498
00:31:08,862 --> 00:31:14,434
They were tight once. They ran together. One day Guardo's
girlfriend told him she thought my brother was handsome.

499
00:31:19,363 --> 00:31:23,352
You keep this visit to yourself,
you'll never see me again.

500
00:31:27,643 --> 00:31:29,194
Maybe they won't show.

501
00:31:30,551 --> 00:31:31,762
Not likely.

502
00:31:33,501 --> 00:31:35,084
Not like Ronnie.

503
00:31:35,585 --> 00:31:36,602
He's quiet.

504
00:31:37,652 --> 00:31:39,332
There's something there.

505
00:31:40,478 --> 00:31:43,321
Wouldn't mind doing a little
strike team time myself.

506
00:31:43,511 --> 00:31:46,385
Fall into the shit,
get the blood moving.

507
00:31:46,886 --> 00:31:47,710
Yeah.

508
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:50,682
It's too bad you get those headaches.

509
00:31:51,371 --> 00:31:53,196
You know, you're very sarcastic.

510
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:55,102
I forgot to list that one.

511
00:31:55,352 --> 00:31:59,196
You ready to hear a little
constructive criticism yourself?

512
00:31:59,441 --> 00:32:00,910
Are you kidding me?

513
00:32:01,136 --> 00:32:03,284
I don't need that kind of head trip.

514
00:32:05,643 --> 00:32:07,532
Got 3 bikers coming in.

515
00:32:18,984 --> 00:32:20,244
What's going on?

516
00:32:21,358 --> 00:32:22,973
- Who's that?
- Tom.

517
00:32:23,522 --> 00:32:24,620
My cousin.

518
00:32:25,686 --> 00:32:28,480
You are hard to reach.
You got a problem?

519
00:32:29,152 --> 00:32:31,461
You want a lot of shit, man.
It takes time to cook it up.

520
00:32:31,558 --> 00:32:33,173
So, let's see it.

521
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,768
You know, if this works out,

522
00:32:44,881 --> 00:32:47,029
we can make this a regular thing.

523
00:32:48,596 --> 00:32:50,017
Hands! Hands!

524
00:32:50,901 --> 00:32:52,160
Move in. Move in. Move in.

525
00:32:52,274 --> 00:32:53,937
- I got 'em.
- Get down. Turn around.

526
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:55,923
- Don't move!
- Easy, man.

527
00:32:56,604 --> 00:32:58,736
Turn around.
Turn around!

528
00:33:00,698 --> 00:33:01,829
Get there.

529
00:33:02,567 --> 00:33:05,393
- Spread 'em! Spread 'em.
- Don't move.

530
00:33:06,168 --> 00:33:08,462
All clear.
We got 'em all.

531
00:33:08,763 --> 00:33:13,318
Nice operation. Thanks for making
me look good to the captain.

532
00:33:15,441 --> 00:33:17,600
Way to go, Billy.
Thanks.

533
00:33:17,998 --> 00:33:19,483
No biggie. Hey.

534
00:33:20,275 --> 00:33:22,164
Hey, great job out there.

535
00:33:22,305 --> 00:33:24,970
You were the one with the idea
of taking down the horde.

536
00:33:25,083 --> 00:33:28,781
Guess the tutoring is paying off.
So, when's the next lesson?

537
00:33:28,984 --> 00:33:33,555
I got a little more to do here, but if
you want to stick around, i'll be here.

538
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,411
Ok.

539
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:37,528
I got to go. Can you and Billy
cover me on the paperwork?

540
00:33:37,625 --> 00:33:40,532
- Uh, i guess.
- Thanks. I owe you one. Good work today.

541
00:33:41,449 --> 00:33:42,386
Good job.

542
00:33:51,139 --> 00:33:51,947
Hey.

543
00:33:53,174 --> 00:33:54,386
Let me go.

544
00:33:55,888 --> 00:33:56,921
Please.

545
00:33:57,966 --> 00:33:59,710
Shut up, shit head.

546
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:05,476
I didn't do it.
I swear.

547
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,446
He's got the wrong guy.

548
00:34:07,705 --> 00:34:08,593
Yeah.

549
00:34:08,986 --> 00:34:09,955
I know.

550
00:34:10,779 --> 00:34:13,217
Lino Prieto did it, right?

551
00:34:18,106 --> 00:34:22,467
I came in from the gang.
You could take down the whole crew.

552
00:34:24,647 --> 00:34:26,214
I didn't kill that cop.

553
00:34:26,419 --> 00:34:29,762
Yeah, well you killed a shit-load
of other people.

554
00:34:31,038 --> 00:34:35,189
What about that little backyard barbeque
you and your boys blew up? Huh? Huh?

555
00:34:36,008 --> 00:34:40,724
Those were kids, man. Your grenades blew
holesin them that i could goddamn see through.

556
00:34:41,144 --> 00:34:43,631
I had to walk through their blood.

557
00:34:45,117 --> 00:34:46,183
Money.

558
00:34:46,926 --> 00:34:50,059
I give you money.
I make you rich.

559
00:34:51,136 --> 00:34:52,460
What do you want?

560
00:34:52,961 --> 00:34:53,865
Peace.

561
00:34:55,928 --> 00:34:57,382
I know you'reinterested.

562
00:34:57,559 --> 00:35:01,209
I wouldn't be here if you
were a straight-up cop.

563
00:35:05,033 --> 00:35:06,770
Tell him i escaped.

564
00:35:06,895 --> 00:35:08,344
You could retire tomorrow.

565
00:35:08,407 --> 00:35:09,656
Sorry, man.

566
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,436
I don't like the way blood money spends.

567
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,145
Nydia's pregnant.

568
00:35:22,782 --> 00:35:25,368
Thought you should know
she's going to have your kid.

569
00:35:36,775 --> 00:35:39,674
Lino prieto's been in jail
for the last 3 1/2 weeks.

570
00:35:44,817 --> 00:35:49,353
- Come on, Vic, man.
- So all i got is you.

571
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:00,705
How'd you find my guy?

572
00:36:02,417 --> 00:36:04,067
Was it Emolia?

573
00:36:04,684 --> 00:36:07,220
Kavanaugh? How?

574
00:36:12,369 --> 00:36:14,818
- I'm going to get to the truth.
- I didn't do it!

575
00:36:14,875 --> 00:36:16,512
I didn't... Aah!

576
00:36:24,046 --> 00:36:25,646
Get anything from gardocki?

577
00:36:25,708 --> 00:36:26,958
Nothing specific.

578
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:28,657
Couple of phone calls he
didn't want me to hear.

579
00:36:28,707 --> 00:36:30,332
Could have been anything, really.

580
00:36:30,376 --> 00:36:32,513
How are you adjusting
working with billings?

581
00:36:33,838 --> 00:36:35,550
It's fine.

582
00:36:36,124 --> 00:36:38,086
It's just not the same, that's all.

583
00:36:41,475 --> 00:36:43,512
How's your mystery salvadoran?

584
00:36:43,674 --> 00:36:45,549
Hernan. Nothing.

585
00:36:46,148 --> 00:36:48,535
But now i'm free to look for him.

586
00:36:49,731 --> 00:36:53,417
Um, when we were partners,

587
00:36:53,942 --> 00:36:55,879
i pulled my weight, right?

588
00:36:56,104 --> 00:37:00,353
I mean, you never felt like you were
carrying me or anything, did you?

589
00:37:01,696 --> 00:37:03,496
You made me a better detective.

590
00:37:03,908 --> 00:37:05,933
You'll make billings one, too.

591
00:37:07,346 --> 00:37:09,008
Yeah. Yeah.

592
00:37:17,863 --> 00:37:19,987
Hey. Hey.

593
00:37:20,412 --> 00:37:22,936
Just tell me what i want
to know and this'll be over.

594
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:30,906
Your boss was involved?

595
00:37:33,642 --> 00:37:35,804
Come on, man. He's not talking.

596
00:37:35,831 --> 00:37:37,055
He will.

597
00:37:37,918 --> 00:37:39,242
He'll talk!

598
00:37:40,105 --> 00:37:41,517
Who was it?

599
00:37:41,567 --> 00:37:43,753
Did a black cop get in touch with you?

600
00:37:44,016 --> 00:37:45,415
Kavanaugh?

601
00:37:45,668 --> 00:37:47,243
David Aceveda?

602
00:37:47,305 --> 00:37:49,942
It was Emolia, wasn't it?
It was that salvadorian slut

603
00:37:49,992 --> 00:37:51,841
that tipped you off. I know it.

604
00:37:51,842 --> 00:37:53,378
You know, maybe he didn't do it, man.

605
00:37:53,379 --> 00:37:55,990
- If it wasn't Guardo, who was it?
- Look at him, man.

606
00:37:56,047 --> 00:37:58,734
If he had a name, don't you think
he would have told us by now?

607
00:37:58,796 --> 00:38:01,846
- That just means he was acting alone.
- This is crazy, man.

608
00:38:01,908 --> 00:38:03,395
He killed Lem!

609
00:38:04,389 --> 00:38:06,601
Don't you remember his body, his face?

610
00:38:06,638 --> 00:38:09,100
Do you think you can
just forget that? Huh?

611
00:38:10,206 --> 00:38:12,843
Don't you think he deserves
to die for what he did?

612
00:38:16,229 --> 00:38:18,741
Look, i'm asking you
not to do this for me.

613
00:38:20,644 --> 00:38:22,206
Why not?

614
00:38:23,618 --> 00:38:25,222
Look, he's got money.

615
00:38:25,264 --> 00:38:27,191
I mean, a hell of a lot
more than that ransom.

616
00:38:27,192 --> 00:38:30,261
- He offered me some to let him go.
- You'd put a price on Lem's life?

617
00:38:30,262 --> 00:38:32,423
No, man. Come on.

618
00:38:32,598 --> 00:38:35,585
No! But it always comes
down to the same thing.

619
00:38:35,997 --> 00:38:39,052
Our families. Our futures.
Taking care of all that.

620
00:38:39,077 --> 00:38:41,651
We will. I'm glad your friend died.

621
00:38:41,939 --> 00:38:44,900
Hey, hey, listen to me. Listen to me.

622
00:38:44,988 --> 00:38:46,812
Look, you kill him,

623
00:38:46,882 --> 00:38:49,731
you kill him, you cut off our
chance of ever finding out the truth.

624
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:54,329
I want every single person who had a
hand in this to suffer, not just Guardo.

625
00:39:09,267 --> 00:39:10,705
Thank you.

626
00:39:47,315 --> 00:39:49,002
You were right.

627
00:39:49,534 --> 00:39:51,733
If he had a real name to
tell us, he would have.

628
00:39:52,833 --> 00:39:54,857
He acted alone.

629
00:40:12,205 --> 00:40:13,692
So, what now?

630
00:40:13,755 --> 00:40:16,192
We make sure this body never gets found.

631
00:40:16,685 --> 00:40:21,154
As long as Guardo's at large, he'll always
remain the primary suspect in Lem's death.

632
00:40:21,759 --> 00:40:23,758
We just killed somebody.

633
00:40:34,104 --> 00:40:36,428
Detective work isn't as sexy,

634
00:40:36,632 --> 00:40:39,344
but it's where brain power like
yours really gets utilized.

635
00:40:39,681 --> 00:40:42,643
And one of the things you should
start doing is making a library.

636
00:40:43,092 --> 00:40:45,642
Copy interesting cases, things
you don't want to forget.

637
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:48,615
Take them home. Organize them in a way
you can look through them occasionally.

638
00:40:48,616 --> 00:40:51,340
- Yeah, that's really smart.
- Train your brain.

639
00:40:52,059 --> 00:40:53,783
Always be asking questions.

640
00:40:53,846 --> 00:40:56,495
Think like a detective about
everything in your life,

641
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:58,182
- every second.
- And you have

642
00:40:58,369 --> 00:40:59,969
something like that? A library?

643
00:41:00,001 --> 00:41:03,762
I compiled a couple folders over the
last decade. Pictures, notes, theories.

644
00:41:04,237 --> 00:41:06,624
Keep 'em. I'll show them to
you some time, if you want.

645
00:41:06,649 --> 00:41:08,198
Give you an idea how to organize it.

646
00:41:08,248 --> 00:41:09,848
It's still early.

647
00:41:18,268 --> 00:41:20,018
We could order some chinese food.

648
00:41:20,182 --> 00:41:22,543
I've got a big bottle of wine
i've been waiting to open.

649
00:41:25,318 --> 00:41:26,642
What?

650
00:41:27,429 --> 00:41:29,316
Is this a date?

651
00:41:32,024 --> 00:41:35,011
Uh, i don't know. Do you want it to be?

652
00:41:39,942 --> 00:41:43,504
- Do you have a girlfriend or something?
- No. No. Why?

653
00:41:44,029 --> 00:41:46,403
Because there's a woman
on your porch watching us.

654
00:41:48,321 --> 00:41:49,883
- Stay here.
- Dutch, i'm a cop.

655
00:41:49,996 --> 00:41:52,170
Just give me a second.

656
00:41:53,457 --> 00:41:55,619
- Can i help you?
- I'm agent Zinman.

657
00:41:55,806 --> 00:41:57,668
I.c.e. Left me a message.

658
00:41:58,048 --> 00:42:00,969
- You have information about Hernan?
- Can you lose your date?

659
00:42:42,129 --> 00:42:44,716
Hernando's undercover in
the salvadoran organization.

660
00:42:45,028 --> 00:42:47,984
He's infiltrated that group deeper
than anyone in the federal system.

661
00:42:48,046 --> 00:42:49,812
I can't compromise his position.

662
00:42:49,855 --> 00:42:52,944
I don't want to compromise anything.
I just want to ask him a few questions.

663
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:54,439
Find another intel source

664
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,288
and stop trying to contact him.

665
00:42:56,463 --> 00:42:57,750
I don't think so.

666
00:42:57,988 --> 00:42:59,962
A cop was killed by the salvadorans.

667
00:43:00,074 --> 00:43:01,561
You say your guy is inside?

668
00:43:01,768 --> 00:43:05,254
I'm going to need to talk to him to get
the information i need to solve this case.

669
00:43:05,304 --> 00:43:07,691
I know you're investigating
the murder of a police officer

670
00:43:07,716 --> 00:43:09,803
and you're looking for Guardo Lima,

671
00:43:09,915 --> 00:43:11,590
but he didn't commit that crime.

672
00:43:11,692 --> 00:43:13,134
He, uh... He undercover, too?

673
00:43:13,177 --> 00:43:15,815
According to Hernando, he was out
of the country when it happened.

674
00:43:15,816 --> 00:43:18,751
I know he was out of the country.
It doesn't mean he didn't order it.

675
00:43:18,765 --> 00:43:20,952
Killer used a grenade.
That's Guardo's calling card.

676
00:43:21,071 --> 00:43:22,958
Guardo is back in los angeles.

677
00:43:23,083 --> 00:43:24,107
According to Hernan,

678
00:43:24,182 --> 00:43:27,132
it would take something very
important to bring him out of hiding.

679
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:30,550
Focus your effort there,
but leave Hernan out of it.

680
00:43:30,637 --> 00:43:32,174
Can i use him to find Guardo?

681
00:43:32,249 --> 00:43:34,786
No. Hernan is way too valuable
to the federal government.

682
00:43:34,823 --> 00:43:36,923
This isn't a pissing contest.

683
00:43:36,996 --> 00:43:38,296
It's an order.

684
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:47,518
Guy ever clean this thing out?

685
00:43:47,633 --> 00:43:49,582
It's like being back in high school.

686
00:43:51,032 --> 00:43:53,443
Hey. Remember when he took that?

687
00:43:53,793 --> 00:43:55,955
Disposable. He took from that dealer.

688
00:43:56,199 --> 00:43:58,511
- Last shot.
- Almost got the case thrown out.

689
00:43:58,786 --> 00:44:00,798
Tampering with evidence. Shit.

690
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,959
- Here, you take it.
- I don't need it.

691
00:44:04,941 --> 00:44:06,315
Looks like you do.

692
00:44:12,163 --> 00:44:14,188
Look who's here. How you doin'?

693
00:44:14,391 --> 00:44:17,065
Just had my first good
night's sleep in a while.

694
00:44:17,477 --> 00:44:18,789
Just tell me where you need me.

695
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:21,150
You still have a few days of
personal time left, don't you?

696
00:44:21,151 --> 00:44:23,656
Don't need 'em. Just looking
forward to getting back in the shit.

697
00:44:23,657 --> 00:44:25,257
I'll be glad to accommodate.

698
00:44:25,444 --> 00:44:26,931
- Whose jacket?
- It's Kevin Hyatt.

699
00:44:27,006 --> 00:44:29,018
He used to be a rising star in i.n.s.

700
00:44:29,093 --> 00:44:32,279
When homeland security took over, he
thought the room got a little crowded.

701
00:44:32,498 --> 00:44:34,385
Department's had him for over a year.

702
00:44:34,473 --> 00:44:36,110
He's ours starting next week.

703
00:44:36,234 --> 00:44:37,834
I'll look over it, but

704
00:44:37,896 --> 00:44:40,646
you're not adding anybody to my
team that i don't have approval of.

705
00:44:40,715 --> 00:44:42,977
He's not your addition.
He's your replacement.

706
00:44:43,327 --> 00:44:46,050
You only got a month left before
you're 50 and you retire, right?

707
00:44:46,051 --> 00:44:47,476
Unless my math's wrong.

708
00:44:48,625 --> 00:44:50,350
I need you to get him up to speed.

709
00:44:50,759 --> 00:44:53,171
- A lot can happen in a month.
- True enough.

710
00:44:53,933 --> 00:44:56,445
Hyatt sounds like a solid
guy. Give him a call.

711
00:44:56,632 --> 00:44:58,994
I really need you to help
him with his transition.

712
00:45:00,333 --> 00:45:03,832
Well, like i said, wherever you need me.

713
00:45:04,026 --> 00:45:08,700
