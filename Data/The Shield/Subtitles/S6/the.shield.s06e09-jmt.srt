1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,780
<i>Previously on The Shield...</i>

2
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:03,290
How's the quick-mealer business going?

3
00:00:03,325 --> 00:00:04,790
The machines are still here, which means

4
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,760
You're still lining your
pocket on the department's dime.

5
00:00:06,795 --> 00:00:08,195
You wanna keep the machines, go ahead.

6
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:10,200
Why,so you can still have
it to hang over my head?

7
00:00:10,235 --> 00:00:11,220
Yeah,that's right.

8
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:13,280
My detective found 12
bodies hacked to pieces.

9
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:14,770
Well,11 bodies,one arm.

10
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,120
The killers were salvadoran.

11
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:17,670
The victims were all mexicans.

12
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,800
Eduardo romero? Glad we
found the rest of you.

13
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,100
I'm a Mexican official.
Diplomatic immunity.

14
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:24,800
He was present at the
San Marcos murders.

15
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:25,840
We want him to stick around,

16
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,990
We make sure his $230,000
luggage gets lost.

17
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,370
For the exploratory committee.

18
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:31,750
It's only for 100,000.

19
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:32,910
You'll get the other half

20
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,370
When the people responsible
for the San Marcos killings

21
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,280
Are brought to justice.

22
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:38,280
There's an operative
inside the Salvadorans

23
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:40,520
Who can help solve the
San Marcos house murders.

24
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,290
Mexicans got something big brewing.

25
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:43,520
Salvadorans want a piece of it.

26
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:46,890
Chopping up the bodies, San Marcos
was all about sending a message.

27
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,300
You know who the Salvadorans were

28
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:49,910
Who were swinging the
machetes at San Marcos?

29
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:51,950
It'd be the death of my
crew if I started asking.

30
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,950
Did you talk to Shane?

31
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:53,920
He killed Lem.

32
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,070
I know what you did to Lem.

33
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:56,030
Like this journal.

34
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,870
Everything on paper that we have done,

35
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,070
And you're trying to blackmail
us and that is no b.S.

36
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,270
Tell Kesakian I got a
business proposition for him.

37
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:03,990
I'm a cop he's gonna need to know.

38
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,920
I'm an associate of Essagian.

39
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,110
Santi's insulated.

40
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,000
Been a while since we had a good
relationship with law enforcement.

41
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:11,220
Shane: that's funny. I'm a fixer.

42
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:12,020
I'm Kesakian.

43
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,830
Ok, I need to speak to the real Kesakian.

44
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,890
My father's out of town.

45
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,630
How long do you think you
can keep this a secret?

46
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,080
Long enough for a miracle.

47
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,050
In the meantime,you think
you're running the show?

48
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,120
It's only a matter of time
before Rezian finds out

49
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:23,270
Your father's out of the game.

50
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:25,410
He's gonna come after you
with everything he's got.

51
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:27,290
My father still has a
lot of men loyal to him,

52
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:28,610
And now I have you.

53
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,310
Claudette's been playing you
since the day I showed up.

54
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:32,660
She figured you'd be easier to handle

55
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,180
If you thought there was a future here,

56
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:36,610
Meanwhile orchestrating
things so there won't be.

57
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,130
You caught the man that killed emily?

58
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,800
Yeah. Do you know what
your daughter was doing

59
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:41,690
To get her drugs?

60
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,860
That's not how history has to read.

61
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:44,590
Thank you.

62
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,850
I've got an appeals hearing
in a couple of weeks.

63
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,680
They're gonna decide whether
to force me out or not.

64
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:50,740
I'll see what I can do.

65
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:00,010
You're gonna have to
fire your secretary.

66
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,290
I don't think she's giving
you all your messages.

67
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,650
Look, I still need to
reach a few more people

68
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,300
Before I know where you stand.

69
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,910
I told you where I stand.

70
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,710
They're kicking me
to the curb next week.

71
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,650
The question is, how you gonna stop it

72
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,230
Like you promised?

73
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,980
It's not as manageable as I thought.

74
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,890
You mean, not as manageable

75
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,410
As keeping your daughter's
drugging and whoring

76
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,480
Out of the press after her death? Huh?

77
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:24,760
Look, I am doing all i
can, detective Mackey,

78
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:28,200
But I keep slamming up against
your enemies in the department.

79
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:29,230
We had a deal:

80
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,230
Your daughter's reputation for my job.

81
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,460
Get back to me tomorrow.

82
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,260
What do you want?

83
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,850
An update on the San Marcos murders.

84
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,660
Who are you?

85
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:50,460
Cruz Pezuela. He's representing
a local development company

86
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,770
That has the backing of various
Mexican investment interests.

87
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,340
What's that got to do with San Marcos?

88
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:59,580
The San Marcos slaughter angered
a lot of people here and in mexico.

89
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,520
Yeah, we weren't exactly
thrilled about it.

90
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,400
Did you follow up on the
Salvadoran gang lead we gave you?

91
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,380
Yeah. Can't rule them out.

92
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,060
Well,Cruz has brought me another lead,

93
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,300
And I want you two to look into it.

94
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,060
Go through the captain. She's the
only one that gives us marching orders.

95
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,930
It's a suspect, Javier Rincon,

96
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,660
A Salvadoran gang member
who's in county jail right now.

97
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,750
Who's your source?

98
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:18,880
Doesn't want to be involved.

99
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:20,950
What is it with you people?

100
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,570
We got a guy who got his
arm chopped off at San Marcos

101
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:25,150
Hiding out at the Mexican consulate.

102
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,930
Now your source wants
to hide behind you?

103
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,580
The community either wants us to
solve this crime or it doesn't.

104
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,220
We do.

105
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,170
Rincon's in county?

106
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,770
Well, If he was spouting his
mouth off about San Marcos,

107
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:36,090
Trust me, I would have heard about it.

108
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,270
I don't remember you two
being on the schedule.

109
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,380
Cesar Orozco. He's my source.

110
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,030
Works construction for my company.

111
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,030
My office will give
you the site location.

112
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:50,500
Now you can do something.

113
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:01,190
Aceveda and his amigo had
another tip about San Marcos.

114
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:02,180
Sounds like bullshit.

115
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,990
Yeah,but at least
it's specific bullshit.

116
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,260
If it's easy to comfirm
or knock down,do it,

117
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,130
But no more secret powwows
with them and without me.

118
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,990
Ronnie'll find out if
Rincon has any priors.

119
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,330
I'll find out about Orozco.

120
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:20,350
We've been operating on
a favor to favor basis.

121
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,660
What you're asking, this is taking me

122
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:25,380
Deeper into the belly of the
Armenian beast than I ever intended.

123
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,440
I'll pay you more.

124
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:27,960
This isn't a charge by the hour.

125
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:29,570
I'd need a percentage.

126
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,070
You'll be my partner in this country.

127
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,670
Your apartment ain't safe anymore.

128
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,380
Next few days, I want
you to check into a motel.

129
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,470
They wouldn't dare to hurt me.

130
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,720
They know what my father would do.

131
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,160
Don't be so confident that your
father's condition is such a secret.

132
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:43,795
Gangs know,

133
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,930
And rumors have a way
of turning to fact.

134
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:47,710
I will find a motel.

135
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,830
You can't assassinate your way
into filling daddy's shoes,either.

136
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,230
Soldiers see too many heads
roll, they get nervous.

137
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,700
But I need a demonstration
of my power,yes?

138
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,510
Money's the blood of
these organizations,

139
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,810
And whoever's supplying it is the heart.

140
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,350
Now who's putting the most
cash into the peasants' pockets?

141
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,720
Rezian. He runs the ports.

142
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,950
Importing of all kinds.

143
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,150
It's over 40% of my father's business.

144
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,150
Well,he's the one who's
gonna be looking to take over.

145
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,130
He's a threat.

146
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,770
You willing to take a short
term hit for a long term gain?

147
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,890
I've ready to save what my father built.

148
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,220
Rincon's serving 6
months on an ag assault.

149
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,610
They let him out 3
days ago after a month.

150
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,700
They threw the case out?

151
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,540
Too many shitheads, not enough pillows.

152
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,250
The only thing distracting them is P.O.

153
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,990
My revue panel's next week.

154
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,160
Any last minute advice?

155
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:42,310
Just tell your story.

156
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,660
So what do you think my chances are?

157
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,400
I've learned not to bet against you.

158
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,180
Even if it's a sure thing?

159
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:53,010
It fixed. Panel's
already decided I'm out.

160
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,260
Hiatt doesn't know all the facts.

161
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,100
He should have kept his mouth shut.

162
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,120
You're not even gonna
give me a fair shot?

163
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:12,070
You threw away your fair shot
by taking so many crooked ones.

164
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:13,590
You've got a week.

165
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,660
I need every man on deck.

166
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,390
If you're not up to it, you
don't have to wait for the panel.

167
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:25,140
Your quarterly stats are due next week.

168
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,370
I'm gonna solve San Marcos

169
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:30,030
And get you that numbers bump
you need to save this place.

170
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:32,100
And then you just try to
sit in front of that panel

171
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,650
And tell 'em you don't
need me around here.

What were you inside for,cesar?

175
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:49,360
I hit my wife or something.
That's what she said.

176
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:51,880
Relax,man, we don't care about
how you keep your lady in line.

177
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:53,270
Just tell us about Rincon.

178
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,250
I heard him bragging, you
know? San Marcos or something,

179
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,310
So I tried to listen.

180
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,850
You're Mexican. How'd you get
close enough to the Salvadorans

181
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,780
To hear all that?

182
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,360
We both worked in the cafeteria.

183
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,590
I heard Rincon tell the other guy

184
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,470
That he hacked them up
while they were still alive.

185
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,180
Him and 2 other guys.

186
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,560
Rincon say why he killed 'em?

187
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,230
I gotta go.

188
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,400
Hey,you go when I say you go.

189
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,150
Look,just answer his questions.

190
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,690
You'll get back to
your job a lot sooner.

191
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,480
Man, I told senor Pezuela everything.

192
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:21,180
What's Pezuela's interest in this?

193
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,230
How's a guy like you even
get face time with him?

194
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,110
Everybody knows that
he wants the Salvadorans

195
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:26,270
Who did the San Marcos.

196
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,300
Yeah,but why?

197
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,850
You could have told the Mexicans inside.

198
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,490
You know they would've
taken care of Rincon.

199
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,910
I was the only one to get close to him.

200
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,290
If I would have said something,

201
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,380
They would have had me do the murder.

202
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,210
Yeah. You were scared?

203
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,000
It's not like he's your
old lady or nothing.

204
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,340
This is Garine Essagian.

205
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,030
She keeps the books at this
Armenian bakery I go to.

206
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,560
Come here. There's
nothing to be afraid of.

207
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,720
My boss has started me on
working his other business.

208
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,370
I noticed something wrong

209
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:55,130
When I was going
through, um,how you say?

210
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,250
Uh, inventory.

211
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,730
The inventory.

212
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,700
Her boss is a guy named Rezian.

213
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,350
The bakery is a cover

214
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,660
For his extensive import business.

215
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:06,830
Would you mind stepping out a minute?

216
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,750
Detective vendrell
will be right with you.

217
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,850
Just take a seat right over there.

218
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:16,450
Does she have any idea
what her boss would do

219
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,870
If he knew she was even in here?

220
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,160
Rezian is the Armenian
heavy down at the ports.

221
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,150
His people rubber stamp
the inspection process.

222
00:08:22,185 --> 00:08:23,590
This guy's got an open door

223
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,040
To get whatever he
wants into this country.

224
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:26,070
Why do I get the feeling

225
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:27,520
You're trying to find your own thing,

226
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,000
Distance yourself from Vic?

227
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:31,430
She's got the books going back 2 years.

228
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,210
You wanna get a warrant or not?

229
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,540
Solving San Marcos is top priority.

230
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,550
We don't jump, she could lose her nerve,

231
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,550
And there's plenty of
bodies to go around.

232
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,700
If Hiatt agrees and
the team can handle it,

233
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,600
Then I'm ok with it.

234
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:47,410
But I don't want to
find her chopped off feet

235
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,530
On my desk tomorrow morning.

236
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,200
Yes,ma'am.

237
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,620
Hey,where are we with Rincon?

238
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,820
Left his parole officer 2 messages.

239
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,560
You wanna hit some Salvadoran hot spots?

240
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,410
No. If he knows we're
looking, he'll turtle.

241
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,440
Let's wait for the P.O.

242
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,680
The feds have been trying
to wrest control of the ports

243
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:03,090
Away from the Armenians for years.

244
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,280
We can do it in a day.

245
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,720
Bust this Rezian. Cut off the
Armenians stronghold on the docks.

246
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:08,870
What's Rezian running?

247
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,300
Drugs,girls, lately gasoline.

248
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,600
Stolen,uninspected, untaxed.

249
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:17,100
Shane's got some solid intel
on this guy named Rezian.

250
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:19,820
I brought in this girl who can help
us cut off the Armenians at the knees.

251
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,790
Can we save the wild stabs in the dark

252
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,150
Until after we've caught
the machete wielding psychos?

253
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:25,970
No reason we can't do both.

254
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,120
Julian,go with Shane.

255
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,860
The rest of us stay on San Marcos.

256
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,960
Ronnie here would raise a lot
fewer eyebrows in Little Armenia.

257
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,400
All right. Make me proud.

258
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,540
Shane's up to something,
and I want to know what.

259
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:46,480
That would've been a great case
for julian to cut his teeth on.

260
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,320
You let Vic make you
doubt your instincts.

261
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,850
I'm not so insecure that I can't
take good advice, all right?

262
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,710
You know what happens if Vic
wins that appeals hearing?

263
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,170
He waits about 2 seconds
to reclaim his throne,

264
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,580
Gets you bounced out of here.

265
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:59,690
I'm just saying.

266
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:06,690
Oh,excuse me.

267
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,000
You helping out detective vendrell?

268
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:12,600
Yes.

269
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:13,850
That's good,huh?

270
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,480
Vic Mackey.

271
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:19,100
How do you know Shane?

272
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,300
He likes the bakery where I work.

273
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:24,640
Hey, I need your help.

274
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,850
My Armenian's not what it should be.

275
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,090
Vic: pleasure.

276
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:31,790
Pleasure.

277
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,380
Shane definitely knows this girl.

278
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,710
Well,he wouldn't mess with
the Armenians out of school.

279
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,750
Not with our history.

280
00:10:47,785 --> 00:10:48,780
How can you be so sure?

281
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,610
I never thought Shane would
dig himself in such a hole

282
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,840
With antwon mitchell to
become his bitch, but he did.

283
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,970
Keep an eye on him.
Find out what he's into

284
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,910
And whether it can blow back on us.

285
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,110
Sounds like it's coming from the back.

286
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,050
Yeah. We need Rincon to
give up the other killers,

287
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,080
So follow my lead.

288
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,340
Police. We need to
talk to Javier Rincon.

289
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,240
Just need to chat him up.

290
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,660
His P.O. Said we could find him here.

291
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,530
Just take a second.

292
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:32,820
What do you want?

293
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,290
Javier,can you step out front
so we can talk to you,please?

294
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,420
I'm not leaving,man.

295
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,340
They released me early. I
got papers and everything.

296
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,740
We know you're free and clear.

297
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,370
Then talk to my ass.

298
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:46,770
Bring it out the front
and shoot the shit.

299
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,680
Vic. Vic!

300
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,740
Back it up,man.

301
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,470
Now,you can come on your own,

302
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,670
Or I can drag you through
you friends' blood.

303
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,050
You killed 12 people.

304
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,770
Now the Mexicans want you dead.

305
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,250
We turn you over to them right now,

306
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,610
Maybe we stop a gang
war. Save a lot of lives.

307
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,710
I didn't kill nobody.

308
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:25,870
Your choice.

309
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,500
And you get what you deserve,

310
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,430
Or you give us the other killers,

311
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,450
I fix it so you walk away.

312
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,160
You won't do it.

313
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,740
Take us to byz lat hood.

314
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,780
Let the Mexicans get
the answers out of him.

315
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,030
That what you want?

316
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:41,750
He made his choice.

317
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,350
No. Back to the barn. Now.

318
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,700
Throw this asshole in the cage.

319
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,800
What the hell was that?

320
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,990
I was about to ask you the same thing.

321
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:02,970
Well, I was gonna get the
names of the other 2 killers

322
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,090
Until you shit all over it.

323
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:06,460
This thing is too important
to play fast and loose.

324
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,680
Yeah? Well, I hope
you have another plan.

325
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,400
'Cause these salvans
don't give up their own

326
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,890
Unless it's to save their own skins.

327
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,440
We can't use a coerced confession.

328
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,610
Who's gonna say it was coerced?

329
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,720
You know what? Some of us are
gonna be here long than a week.

330
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,020
Let's get a little sneak peek
at what that's gonna look like.

331
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,250
You can handle the interrogation.

332
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,200
I'll call you later,hon.

333
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:32,720
Who are you?

334
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:33,970
We're the police.

335
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,190
You got a warrant?

336
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,690
We prefer good old
fashioned cooperation.

337
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:37,970
I don't.

338
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:40,990
A guy named Rezian,

339
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,730
What do you see in
every one of those ships

340
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,020
That's been through
here in the last week?

341
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,340
We got cameras.

342
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:49,240
You touch me, and I'll sue the city

343
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,970
For that house i've
been wanting in oxnard.

344
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,000
That's the way to dream big.

345
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,170
We know you're on Rezian's payroll.

346
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:56,640
He tells you which cargo
is safe for inspection.

347
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:58,650
You let the rest slide
in under the radar.

348
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,440
For all we know,you're rubber
stamping the import of nuclear bombs.

349
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,610
I got a pal, homeland security.

350
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,340
His favorite hobby is pulling
the patriot act out of his ass.

351
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,260
Or we could get what we need another way

352
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,770
And just tell the
Armenians it came from you.

353
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,990
Now,that's just plain mean.

354
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,620
Rezian's got a ship coming in every day.

355
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,630
They usually unload around 3:00.

356
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,640
Great. That gives us the afternoon

357
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:24,250
To hear everything you
know about the Armenians.

358
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,840
Waste of time. They're not gonna
let this pissant into the loop.

359
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:27,930
Come on. Let's go.

360
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,360
You breath a word about this to Rezian,

361
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,120
I'll find you...
somewhere without a camera.

362
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,920
This is your last
chance to save yourself.

363
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:44,470
You give me names,

364
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:47,160
I recommend to the judge you
do your time in a safe place.

365
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,450
A safe place?

366
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,000
Yeah.

367
00:14:58,570 --> 00:14:59,680
He won't give up the others.

368
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,290
We're gonna have to
find some other leverage.

369
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,410
One killer's a start.

370
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:05,030
Will the construction
worker Orozco testify?

371
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:05,870
I think so,yes.

372
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,770
Why's that? That's a mistake.

373
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:10,170
The kind of guys who'll chop
up a house full of people?

374
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:11,830
I hate to think what they'd do next

375
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:13,310
Or who they'd be doing it for.

376
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:14,270
What are you talking about?

377
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,700
Remember the one-armed man

378
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:17,920
With the suitcase full of cash?

379
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:20,250
First the Mexican
government sent him his ID

380
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:23,300
Then Pezuela shows up with
his arm up aceveda's ass,

381
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,900
Getting tips from prison,
representing a company

382
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,680
With the backing of Mexican interests?

383
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:29,020
Now there's a conspiracy?

384
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,540
Solving these 12 murders

385
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:31,820
Is as big as I need now.

386
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:34,210
Then let me get Rincon to talk.

387
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:38,080
But if you'd rather
walk away with half a win

388
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,430
And the other killers
free to do it again,

389
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:41,050
You stick with your boy here.

390
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,430
I can't drop you off in byzland,

391
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:54,340
But word that you're the killer

392
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,760
Is gonna hit the Mexican
side of the street,

393
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,660
If it hasn't already.

394
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:59,160
Means I need my own
people to keep my back.

395
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:01,980
Unless I can convince Santi
and the rest of the Mexicans

396
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:02,920
That you didn't do it.

397
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,910
It takes your price off the street.

398
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,580
You give us the other
killers that we need,

399
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:10,040
You can start scheduling
your next welcome home party.

400
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,880
You can convince the wetbacks?

401
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:12,850
Count on it.

402
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,780
I gotta hear with my own ears.

403
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:15,860
No probLem.

404
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,910
Japanese american male.

405
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,510
Single hit to the head. Bruised chin.

406
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:24,660
Bit of a scuffle, but he
didn't put up much of a fight.

407
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,140
Looks like Dorothy was
an internet cruiser.

408
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,500
Maybe he invited the wrong
person over for a quickie.

409
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,230
Ladies and gents, we've
got ourselves a homicide.

410
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,710
No sign of forced entry.

411
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,030
Yeah,not in the apartment,anyway.

412
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,920
Uh,what about a murder weapon?

413
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,210
We've been all through the place.

414
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,060
The guy actually filled out his
emergency contact information.

415
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:43,490
His parents live in eagle rock.

416
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:45,170
I hate notifications.

417
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:46,040
Steve can do it.

418
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:46,930
Oh,no. No way.

419
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:49,010
The folks probably didn't even
know junior switched sides.

420
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:52,160
I'm really gonna miss
that quick-mealer.

421
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,330
Fine.

422
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:56,860
Can I have that?

423
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,750
Mama-san balled all over me.

424
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,750
I put an internet profile on
your desk. You should read it.

425
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,530
Have you ever seen a japanese lady wail?

426
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,350
Somebody had to do it.

427
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:10,470
Danny or Tina.

428
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,750
I'm not gonna let you rule my life
over this vending machine thing.

429
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:16,390
Sure you are. Read the profile.

430
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:19,140
"Mason heller. Film nut.

431
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,310
Good guy looking for someone
looking for something real."

432
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:24,430
Our suspect. Called the victim
6 times in the last 8 days,

433
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,750
Final time last night at 10:00.

434
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,520
M.E. Puts tentative t.O.D. At 11:00.

435
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,660
Here he is, even as we speak.

436
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,430
Hey, I tried that
restaurant you recommended.

437
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,980
Best spring rolls in l.A.,right?

438
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,090
Yeah. Anyway, thanks for the tip.

439
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,000
Guess whose apartment is 2 blocks
away from where the victim lives.

440
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,920
I thought we'd head back to the scene,

441
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,920
See if Mason dropped the
murder weapon on the way home.

442
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:46,810
Good thinking.

443
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,320
Is this a friday? It
feels like a wednesday.

444
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,640
Yeah,day after thursday,

445
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,770
Which relates to you bashing
your lover's face in how?

446
00:17:58,940 --> 00:17:59,890
Tell me about Alan.

447
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,170
I really should go.

448
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,570
Well,you're not under arrest.

449
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,580
But if you do try to leave,

450
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:10,200
We will file charges and
detain you officially.

451
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,240
What happened to your hand?

452
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,250
Maybe you cut it
flattening a guy's skull.

453
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,280
Mason? Mason?

454
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,070
I know this is hard.

455
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,880
Oh,come on. This is the male version

456
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:24,240
Of the same old pathetic story.

457
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,280
Guy gets the hots bad
for a nice piece of ass

458
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:27,460
And he can't deal with rejection.

459
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,910
You wanna be pissed at me,get
even, don't do it in there.

460
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,830
Aw, come on. It's not my fault

461
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:40,960
The guy's got one
foot in the psych ward.

462
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,810
He's just fragile. And since
psychological complexity

463
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:46,040
Isn't exactly your strong suit,back off.

464
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,440
Do you got any crisp singles?

465
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,260
I wanna get a cup of soup
out of one of your machines

466
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,250
While they're still there.

467
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,650
Have to be getting close.

468
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,040
It cost me 60 bucks to fill my truck.

469
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,160
Of course,mara insists on full serve.

470
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,300
You want to chat up a buddy,

471
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:17,850
Go find one.

472
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,600
That's Rezian. This is it.

473
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,270
So do I need to watch my back?

474
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:42,590
Do i?

475
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,750
Hey,police! Let's go!
Down on your knees!

476
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,030
On your knees. On your knees.

477
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,520
Drop that money! Drop that money!

478
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,210
You're under arrest

479
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:57,300
For the importing of illegal goods.

480
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,550
You mention one word

481
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:00,230
About how I helped you out
with that gas station owner

482
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:01,680
And I'll up the charge to murder.

483
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:03,060
You make big mistake.

484
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,310
Yeah. I'll call for transport.

485
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:06,940
My people won't let
you get away with this.

486
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:08,920
You don't have people.

487
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,960
Kesakian junior's in charge now,

488
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:12,570
So your crew ain't happening.

489
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:14,480
You keep causing trouble,

490
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,720
We'll just suffocate
you on your own gonads.

491
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:22,090
Was Alan thinking about
filing a restraining order?

492
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,190
Ok. Thanks for your help.

493
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,550
Welcome back.

494
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:26,870
Wish we had better news.

495
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,670
No murder weapon?

496
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,250
No. Walked it 5 different ways.

497
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,250
Looked under every bush,
hit every trash can.

498
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,320
Wait a minute. You got
these 2 beautiful women

499
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,390
Looking in trash cans?

500
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,640
Tina: it's part of the job, right?

501
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,490
Dutch: ha ha ha ha.

502
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,470
Garbage pickup's tomorrow afternoon.

503
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,100
Ok.

504
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,260
Hey, my man.

505
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:44,220
Hey.

506
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,170
You are my hero.

507
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:48,720
Oh,yeah?

508
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:50,280
Why's that?

509
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,020
Hanlon.

510
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:55,460
Oh, I'm sorry. I just assumed,
the way she talks about you.

511
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,110
Never mind.

512
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,530
I don't make a habit of banging chicks

513
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,880
That know where to
find me in the morning.

514
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,260
So the Dutchman has a shot then?

515
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,150
Dutch?

516
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:07,120
Sure. You get her fires all stoked,

517
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,940
Heat's gotta go somewhere,right?

518
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,220
He's been working that caring mentor
angle like there's no tomorrow.

519
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,480
Uh-huh.

520
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,760
You lost,my friend.

521
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:20,140
Dutchy bailed out on me.

522
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,110
What happened to you?

523
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,920
Look, I told you I'd make another deal

524
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:25,860
And give you the guys who
did San Marcos, and I will.

525
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:29,430
No more deal. We can take care of
the San Marcos business ourselves.

526
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:30,780
Rincon didn't do it.

527
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:31,930
That's not what we hear.

528
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:35,180
He's a poser. She shot off
his mouth for juice inside.

529
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:37,840
He didn't kill those people or
he'd be sitting here right now

530
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:38,890
Courtesy of me.

531
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:39,920
Why should I believe you?

532
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,790
'Cause I'm trying to
prevent more bloodshed.

533
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:45,010
And I'd glad give up the assholes
who hacked up those people to do it.

534
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,800
I have a lead about the real killers.

535
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,650
You sit tight for a
day, forget about Rincon,

536
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:53,310
And you'll get your justice.

537
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:56,530
One day.

538
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,670
After that, somebody's gonna pay.

539
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,090
I don't give a shit who.

540
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:02,590
Feel safer now?

541
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,840
Vic get the names of his accomplices?

542
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:09,680
Yeah.

543
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,340
These names better check out.

544
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,600
They will. So when do I get out of here?

545
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,730
Answers first.

546
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,820
How'd you kill those
people at San Marcos?

547
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:23,630
Something big's coming up. I
didn't get too much details.

548
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:25,410
All I know is we were
cut out by the Mexicans

549
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,860
And people are pissed off.

550
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:28,440
Who ordered you to do it?

551
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:29,960
Guardo.

552
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:31,640
He said we were sending a message.

553
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:33,620
Kill everybody in the
house jungle style.

554
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:35,890
There's a dude by the name of romero.

555
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,530
We were supposed to leave him alive.

556
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:39,280
So you just cut off his arm.

557
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,190
Know a guy named Cruz Pezuela?

558
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,200
Nah. Don't know him.

559
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:46,050
Ok. Stay put. It's gonna take
a while to get you sprung.

560
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,400
How'd it go with Shane?

561
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:50,980
Well,he wasn't too subtle

562
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:52,920
About not wanting me to dig
deeper into the Armenians.

563
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,880
What happens when we don't
give Santi his revenge?

564
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:59,630
Hell breaks loose,
unless we can find a way

565
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:01,350
To make claudette and
the Mexicans happy.

566
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,060
Here he is.

567
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,410
Rincon punked us.

568
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:13,760
Our guy wasn't where he said he-

569
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,640
Second guy was a no-show,too,

570
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,040
But Ronnie sweet talked the sister.

571
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:19,810
They're both getting sloshed
at a bar up the street.

572
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,170
Let's go catch us some killers.

573
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:22,290
I'll call for backup.

574
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:29,170
Police! Everybody stay
right where you are.

575
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:36,910
You. Take your glasses off.

576
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:47,560
Damn! Not such a sweet
talker after all,huh?

577
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,200
Hey. What happened to
staying at the motel?

578
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,210
I needed a few things for my father.

579
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:08,300
I was gonna go in only
for a minute,but...

580
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,150
The door. I felt someone inside.

581
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:13,220
Did you see anything?
Did you hear anything?

582
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:14,910
Just the feeling.

583
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,650
You think I'm paranoid?

584
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,000
You'd be stupid not to be.

585
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:19,320
I'll be right back,ok?

586
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:53,420
Hey! Police! Stay where you are!

587
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:54,780
Stay where you are right now!

588
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:58,080
Come here.

589
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:00,380
Let me tell you something.

590
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,040
Rezian's behind bars,
so the port business

591
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:04,790
And the dreams that go
with it went bye-bye.

592
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,040
The only way you're gonna earn

593
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,590
Is to fall in line with
Kesakian's daughter.

594
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,890
She's in charge now.

595
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,570
Spread the word.

596
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:29,830
They know about my father.

597
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,160
They wouldn't dare to do this otherwise.

598
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,650
I busted Rezian accepting
an illegal shipment,

599
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:36,860
So his port business won't be
up and running any time soon.

600
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,960
Then these men need to
understand that they need me.

601
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:44,300
Yeah. Rezian's gonna come
back kicking and screaming,

602
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:46,740
So we need to find a way to keep
him behind bars for the long haul.

603
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:49,370
He has a warrant, or the books.

604
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:51,580
Yeah,and a star witness
who's not who she says she is.

605
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:53,390
Don't worry.

606
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:55,660
This is where I start earning my keep.

607
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:16,110
Get up.

608
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,610
Rincon being innocent is bullshit.

609
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:41,470
You lied to me?

610
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,060
Only way I could get him
to give up these 2 assholes.

611
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,280
The good news is after 18
months of a long prosecution,

612
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:48,790
You'll know exactly where to find him.

613
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,700
Him later. I'll take what you got now.

614
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:27,550
What's the good word?

615
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:32,070
Don't tell me you haven't
reached the right people yet.

616
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:34,990
I can't help you. I'm sorry.

617
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,920
I tried,but it's not possible.

618
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:39,490
Try harder.

619
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:40,600
No.

620
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,160
Well, I guess it's time the world knew

621
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:48,460
Who your daughter really was.

622
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:50,470
You won't do that.

623
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:52,640
You won't say anything because
you want to still keep your job.

624
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:55,490
You change your story now,

625
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:57,970
It'll reveal how you
manipulated the circumstances

626
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:01,440
Of my daughter's case, you'll
expose yourself as unethical.

627
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,440
Ha ha ha ha.

628
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:04,250
I've been accused of worse.

629
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:06,980
No. This time you're gonna
verify it with your own words.

630
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:12,680
Look, I tried to keep
up my part of the deal,

631
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:16,780
But you've built a mountain
of bad will too high to climb.

632
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,880
Good luck,detective.

633
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:34,380
Wilshire division found 2
bodies in an alley off Pico.

634
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:37,500
Well,at least Santi
remembered where to dump 'em.

635
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:42,580
Wilshire sent over the pictures.

636
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:43,860
They our 2 missing killers?

637
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,380
Well,what's left of them.

638
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,940
Their wallets were found in
a trash can down an alley.

639
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:50,570
Our poking around must
have flushed 'em out.

640
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,800
I would have preferred them
back here alive and talking.

641
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:55,430
Wilshire's homicide
rate just went up by 2,

642
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,600
But you still have one live murderer

643
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,950
To trot in front of the cameras
right here in farmington.

644
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:02,800
San Marcos is officially closed.

645
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:03,920
Thank you.

646
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,710
Well,we got the guys
who wielded the machetes,

647
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:08,000
But not the guys who ordered it.

648
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,170
You need me, I'll be digging into

649
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:12,080
How aceveda's lap dog
fits into this puzzle.

650
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:18,370
It's just a matter of time before
we find the murder weapon,Mason.

651
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:19,990
I can't tell you anything.

652
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,840
You won't. There's a fairly
significant difference.

653
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,630
It's not a crime to like someone.

654
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,600
It is if they don't like
you back and you kill 'em.

655
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:30,310
Did Alan say he didn't
want to see you anymore?

656
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:33,850
Alan...

657
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:38,200
Mason,here's what we're dealing with.

658
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:40,990
There are several people who
say you were hounding him.

659
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:42,540
That's supported by the phone records.

660
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,970
There was no forced entry, so
we know he knew his attacker,

661
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:48,050
And you called him an
hour before he died.

662
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:51,040
Now, if you could give us an alibi,

663
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:52,620
But you don't seem to have one.

664
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:55,970
I can't tell you anything.

665
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:59,190
Please. I can't.

666
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,080
Why doesn't he ask for a lawyer?

667
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,110
What's the point?

668
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,600
Then why hasn't he confessed?

669
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,230
Well,you're the theorizer.

670
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:09,550
You ask.

671
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,790
Sucks about sofer not letting
you take a run at her killer.

672
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,090
What do you mean?

673
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,800
Oh, I shouldn't have said anything.

674
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:21,560
We were gonna bring
you into interrogation,

675
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:23,170
Give you a chance to show your stuff,

676
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:25,180
But she wouldn't have it. Said
you didn't have the skills.

677
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,260
Really?

678
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:28,940
I guess it's understandable.

679
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:30,840
Understandable?

680
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:33,410
Well,sure. I mean, obviously
she's making a play for Hiatt.

681
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,870
Him thinking you're a screwup
just makes you less of a threat.

682
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:38,280
Sort of petty,

683
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:40,590
But that poor guy can't
take his eyes off you,

684
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,840
So what else is she gonna do?

685
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:45,440
You think kevin's into me?

686
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:48,630
I know he's definitely not into her.

687
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,550
Oh, I don't know.

688
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:51,690
I've seen 'em cozy a couple times.

689
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:54,970
Look,I'm gonna stay out of it.

690
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:57,180
So please, don't say anything to Danny

691
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,380
'Cause she'll know it was me.

692
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,120
Sure.

693
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,420
You're safe here.

694
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,850
Just gonna make sure
that Rezian understood

695
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:09,950
His end of our conversation.

696
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,100
Then we'll get you out of here.

697
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,410
Turns out no Garine Essagian
works at Rezian's bakery.

698
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:21,980
But the nice lady on the phone told me

699
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:23,920
That Kesakian's daughter
diro helps out with the books

700
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:24,890
From time to time.

701
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,890
Sounds like Shane made a big bust today.

702
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,140
On behalf of the department, thank you.

703
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:37,510
I'm glad I could help.

704
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:39,950
So what brings you to the united states?

705
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:42,620
Opportunity. The weather.

706
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:43,640
Your father?

707
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:49,370
I hear Kesakian's in the hospital.

708
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:50,590
I'm sorry.

709
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,940
My father's a noble man.

710
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,540
He's also the leader of
a bunch of brutal yahoos.

711
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:57,270
Now,where do you fit into that?

712
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,690
My father is a businessman.

713
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:01,050
I just translate, keep the books.

714
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:02,960
The real ones or the fake ones?

715
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,960
Look,you seem like a very nice girl.

716
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:12,620
I'm sure your intentions are good.

717
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,020
Then why are we having
this conversation?

718
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:16,800
Because you need a
friend in this department.

719
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,070
Someone besides Shane vendrell.

720
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,690
You ever heard of antwon mitchell?

721
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:25,890
He was the leader of a black
gang called the one-Niners.

722
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,160
Shane and he did some
business last year.

723
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:29,550
Some heat came down

724
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:32,300
And an innocent
14-year-old girl got killed.

725
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,990
Now mitchell's spending the
rest of his life behind bars.

726
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:38,250
That has nothing to do with anything.

727
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,090
Shane's still under investigation,

728
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,490
And so is everyone he
comes in contact with.

729
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,220
I don't know what kind of arrangement

730
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,480
You two have between you if any,

731
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:47,830
But just know...

732
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,320
When the chips fall,

733
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,250
They always land on
Shane's side of the table.

734
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:56,330
You need anything, diro, you call me.

735
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,120
Hey! Hey!

736
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:11,230
Hey,where you going?

737
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:12,630
This is not going to work.

738
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,180
That cop knows what's going on.

739
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:14,980
Who?

740
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,610
Detective Mackey.

741
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:19,720
Hey,listen to me. Listen to me.

742
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:21,140
Look,whatever he told you

743
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,110
Was a fishing expedition.

744
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:24,070
He doesn't know anything.

745
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:26,210
He knew my name, who my father is.

746
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,490
I can control him.

747
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:30,120
I'll see you get compensation for today,

748
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:31,530
And I thank you.

749
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,630
But we cannot be partners.
I have to be careful.

750
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:34,860
Hey,listen to me-

751
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:36,210
Do not bother me again.

752
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:42,850
Hey! What the hell
did you say to my c.I.?

753
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:45,840
Who, Garine Essagian?

754
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,440
Told her to stay the hell away from you,

755
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:49,860
Same as I would any girl.

756
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:51,700
She didn't concern you.

757
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,030
If she's putting money
in your pocket, she does.

758
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,660
You don't get to profit
off this place. Not anymore.

759
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,140
We don't need you dragging us into

760
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:00,050
Yet another vendrell shitpile special.

761
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,220
You just stay out of my way.

762
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,530
This'll all go a lot smoother

763
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:05,920
I'm not looking for smooth.

764
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:08,760
I'm looking to make you as
miserable as I possibly can

765
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,790
,you gotta try harder.

766
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:12,150
I've been working for you so
long, I got a high tolerance.

767
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:14,320
Whatever you got going on
with, this broad it ends now.

768
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:16,775
I want you out of farmington
and away from everyone in it.

769
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:19,210
What are we, 5 days and
counting until that appeals panel

770
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,460
Shoves your badge your ass?

771
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:22,810
Tells you to find greener pastures?

772
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:23,770
I'm not gong anywhere.

773
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:26,080
There's no trap door this time, Vic.

774
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,020
They got you boxed in.

775
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,450
Stay away from the Kesakians.

776
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,230
I'll stop by and say hi

777
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,140
When you start your
security job in northridge.

778
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:37,120
Meantime,I'm pulling my
request for a transfer.

779
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:40,340
You're leaving, so I may as well stay.

780
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:51,940
A man brought this in.

781
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:53,480
Said he found it in
the bed of his pickup,

782
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:56,990
Which was parked a block
from Alan's house last night.

783
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,450
But you already knew that.

784
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:01,790
We take this down to the lab,

785
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,460
It's gonna come back with
your fingerprints on it.

786
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:04,750
It's just a matter of time.

787
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:05,420
My time.

788
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:07,420
You said that before.

789
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,670
Why don't you tell us what happened.

790
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,700
Judge are always more
inclined to be lenient

791
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:12,790
After you've confessed.

792
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,260
You ever heard of progeria?

793
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:21,500
It's a kind of disease,right?

794
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,290
Only 40 kids in the world have it.

795
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:27,390
I knew one, johnny wilcox.

796
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:28,710
He was cool.

797
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,480
Yeah,you get old really fast.

798
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:34,060
You shrivel up. Get arthritis.

799
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,370
He died when we were 12.

800
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,720
Massive heart attack.

801
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,070
Everyone thinks they have more time.

802
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,870
I saw johnny when they took him
out of his house after he died.

803
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:52,870
Just a tiny little bump under a sheet.

804
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,460
Do you want to see Alan's body?

805
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:56,580
We could take you down there.

806
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,690
No. I just...

807
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:01,480
I want to stay here.

808
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,870
A good margarita on the rocks with salt.

809
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:08,450
None of that blended shit.

810
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,120
Jack. Neat.

811
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,370
Ice is for pussies.

812
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:14,230
Now a bad day, that's a vodka martini.

813
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:16,600
Who says all cops are alcoholics,huh?

814
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:20,470
And then there are days like this.

815
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,530
So what's it gonna be?

816
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:23,930
Definitely a 3 martini night.

817
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:29,000
Hey,get me out of here.

818
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,820
The deal was 2 for 1. Alive.

819
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,820
Guess the Mexicans screwed
you by getting to 'em first.

820
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:35,750
Tough luck.

821
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,300
Glad you came up for air.

822
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:51,710
Just in time to ID
The San Marcos suspect.

823
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:55,240
He'll cooperate as soon as all
his property is returned to him.

824
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:57,800
Oh,you mean the briefcase
with the 200 grand inside?

825
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:00,000
I forgot to ask what
all that money was for.

826
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,390
And he never has to answer that.

827
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:05,000
Somebody chopped my arm off, getting
paid would be the last thing on my mind.

828
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,810
Well,when you've lived
through that experience,

829
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:08,260
We'll be interested in your comments.

830
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,830
How do we expedite the
return of the money?

831
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:15,750
Silent types always made me curious,

832
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,930
So I did a little homework.

833
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:20,340
I understand you went to
college with Cruz Pezuela.

834
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,980
The guy hangs with an interesting crowd,

835
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,540
Everything from government
officials to Mexican cons.

836
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,060
What's that have to do with my client?

837
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:27,860
I don't know yet...

838
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:30,420
But I'm gonna find out.

839
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:32,660
Let's go.

840
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,270
You might have heard I'm out of here.

841
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,930
They say I got 5 days left,

842
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:43,710
And I'm gonna use every second of 'em

843
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,930
To find out what's going on here.

844
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,000
Why those people died and you didn't,

845
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,220
Where that money was going,

846
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,590
And what Pezuela's
angle is in all of this.

847
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,970
Your suspect still here?

848
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,720
He never asked to leave.

849
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:07,390
He wants to sit in
interrogation all night,let him.

850
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,650
Any fingerprints come
back on the statue?

851
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,710
Uh,tomorrow morning.

852
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,920
You look tired. You should go.

853
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,170
If only.

854
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,330
What do I have to do?

855
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:33,800
Change is hard for everybody.

856
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:35,080
You still need me.

857
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,020
Hiatt,he's not gonna get it done.

858
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:38,270
He'll have his chance.

859
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,290
What,like today?

860
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,790
He's a sheep,not a shepherd.

861
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:44,050
You pushed him too fast.

862
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,030
I solved this thing before
the quarterly stats were due.

863
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,640
You gonna tell me that saving this place

864
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:49,920
Doesn't earn me a spot here?

865
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,150
Nothing that happened today

866
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,740
Is gonna change what i
have to say to the panel.

867
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:54,450
Forget the panel.

868
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:56,490
You've gotta give me more time

869
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:57,850
To get into the San Marcos thing,

870
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:58,970
Pezeula's place in it.

871
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:02,570
We have 3 murderers whose
only link was to guardo.

872
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:04,330
He's either missing or dead.

873
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:06,240
You're done.

874
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:10,830
I can get to the truth of this thing.

875
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,340
Maybe,but we'll never know.

876
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,720
Because it's somebody else's job now.

877
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,230
I'm going after Pezuela.

878
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,950
I'm gonna dig up all the dirt
you two have been playing in,

879
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:32,110
And I'm gonna bring both of you down.

880
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:35,620
You use your last few hours here
any way you want to,detective.

881
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:38,190
I'll bet at the end of it all,

882
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:39,280
I'm gonna find out that it was you

883
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:40,930
Who gave up Hernan's cover,too.

884
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:41,990
Who's Hernan?

885
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,310
Undercover I.C.E. Agent.

886
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:45,080
Infiltrated the Salvadorans.

887
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:48,330
He was on the verge of
giving us the San Marcos intel

888
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:50,790
When word leaked that the
Salvadorans had a mole.

889
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,550
Did you tell your good buddy Cruz

890
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,890
About the undercover agent
working the Salvadorans?

891
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,560
No. Sure you did.

892
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,570
All I have to do is prove it.

893
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:56,460
Good morning.

894
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:58,570
How you doing?

895
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:02,080
Never better. Actually, a little busy.

896
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:06,150
So i've been doing some research,

897
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:07,640
And it turns out there's a lot of people

898
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:09,350
That are looking to hire former cops.

899
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:12,830
You could be an investigator
for a law firm or a p.I.

900
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,550
I know it's not what you want,

901
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:16,580
But you'd be good at it.

902
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:18,360
You could take care of the kids.

903
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:21,160
Thanks for pulling this together.

904
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:21,950
No probLem.

905
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,830
Uh...

906
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:30,400
I'm sorry...about
everything that's happened.

907
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:33,030
I can't believe it.

908
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,550
We have a probLem.

909
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:47,460
Aceveda: what's that?

910
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,760
I heard the cop who solved the murders

911
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:50,720
Is being forced out.

912
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:52,700
Mackey? That's been a long time coming.

913
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:54,380
Can we do anything about it?

914
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:55,440
No. That's done.

915
00:41:55,970 --> 00:41:57,840
Well, wouldn't it make more
sense for the community

916
00:41:57,850 --> 00:42:00,630
To keep good cops who
share our interests?

917
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:01,880
That's not gonna happen.

918
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:02,910
I'd like you to reconsider.

919
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:04,950
There are plenty of
good cops in farmington,

920
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,370
Despite your experience.

921
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:07,230
Not like him.

922
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,270
The department will be
better off without him

923
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:10,620
And so will the community.

924
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:12,390
You just have to trust me on that.

925
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:18,180
The rest of what I promised
for your exploratory committee.

926
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,200
I might take a few days to cash it.

927
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,460
If you don't confess,

928
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:36,530
We're gonna arrest you
solely on the evidence.

929
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:38,290
You're going to jail.

930
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,310
It really is just a matter of time.

931
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:52,880
Sometimes I think if you
don't admit it to yourself,

932
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:57,530
To me, what's gonna
happen isn't gonna happen.

933
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,780
But some things are just inevitable

934
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:04,390
Once certain forces are set in motion.

935
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:06,340
Can't change it back.

936
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:08,870
Yeah. It's done.

937
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:17,700
If I tell you how it happened,

938
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:18,990
How sorry I am,

939
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:23,740
And that all I wanted was to love him...

940
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:27,870
And be loved back,

941
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:31,650
Can I stay here a while longer?

942
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,190
Sure. Until we need the room.

943
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,400
The second I leave
here, my life is over.

944
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:42,720
Eat your breakfast.

945
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:53,810
I told you,stay away.

946
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:54,930
Just give me a minute.

947
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:56,720
Ok?

948
00:43:58,850 --> 00:43:59,930
You checked out of the motel.

949
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,060
They found out about
my father's illness.

950
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,870
They will come again. I won't hide.

951
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:07,760
I'll protect you. I already have.

952
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:10,920
Is that what your friend
antwon mitchell thought?

953
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,060
Antwon.

954
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:15,000
I that what Vic told you?

955
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:17,830
He told me many things.

956
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:20,390
That a little girl got killed,

957
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,500
That you are being investigated.

958
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:24,200
Well,that's a crock of shit.

959
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:27,060
Vic's been on iad's radar for years.

960
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:29,110
He's being swept out as we speak.

961
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:32,070
And that little girl was not my fault.

962
00:44:32,990 --> 00:44:34,310
He has no reason to lie to me.

963
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,690
He has every reason to lie to you.

964
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:36,970
He does.

965
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:39,480
What'd he do,give you
a shoulder to cry on?

966
00:44:39,850 --> 00:44:41,190
Offer to lend a helping hand?

967
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,810
He'll be reaching into your
pocketbook by next week.

968
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:44,710
Like you?

969
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,350
I need to be alone. Now please go.

970
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:51,230
No. You're gonna believe me first.

971
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:52,720
I'm better off on my own.

972
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:54,010
You're gonna get killed without me.

973
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:56,540
Look...

974
00:44:57,050 --> 00:44:58,550
I saved your life yesterday.

975
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:00,360
I took down Rezian.

976
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:01,690
I got him out of the way

977
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:03,370
So that you could assume
the throne. That was me.

978
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:04,430
I'll pay you more.

979
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:06,960
Look, I risked my ass for you.

980
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,970
My job.

981
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,570
Now,that's not how this shit works.

982
00:45:11,590 --> 00:45:14,100
I'm sorry. Good-Bye!

983
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,780
Go. I mean it. Go!

984
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:17,330
Listen to me. Vic
stole from your father.

985
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:19,660
The Armenian money trade?

986
00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:21,180
Got robbed a few years back?

987
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:22,340
A few guys got killed?

988
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:23,780
The money was never found?

989
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:27,070
That was Vic. Him and his guys.

990
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:30,050
And he asked me to be a part of it.

991
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:32,650
When I said no, I became a threat.

992
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:38,480
Vic's had a bull's-eye
on my back ever since.

993
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:47,150
My father lost 6 months
of profit in that.

994
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:51,700
Well, I guess you've had a
much better understanding

995
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,510
Of your father's
dealings than you told me.

996
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:58,230
Well,that's it. Full disclosure.

997
00:45:58,830 --> 00:46:01,870
Both of us. Now whose
side do you want to be on?

998
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,190
I'm gonna have to deal with him,too.

999
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:06,450
Who,Vic?

1000
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:09,040
Wait a second. I didn't tell you that-

1001
00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:11,010
But you have told me,
and you were right before.

1002
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:13,060
I must finish the job.

1003
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:15,000
There is no middle ground.

1004
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:24,250
The mayor come crying
back to you already?

1005
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:26,490
That happened faster
than I thought it would.

1006
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:28,990
Congratulations on solving the murders.

1007
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:30,690
Thank you, but I'm not finished.

1008
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:32,600
Couldn't have done it without my tip.

1009
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,510
Or at least not as fast.

1010
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:36,450
Stop turning over rocks.

1011
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:38,620
Not until I find out
what's crawling underneath.

1012
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,590
Yeah, I was just telling aceveda

1013
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,590
How much this city needs cops like you.

1014
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:46,800
He doesn't see it that way.

1015
00:46:47,590 --> 00:46:48,410
Not yet.

1016
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:49,300
Not ever.

1017
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,620
Yeah,you can keep wasting my time.

1018
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:56,840
I'm gonna have plenty of it.

1019
00:46:58,420 --> 00:46:59,600
I can get you your job back.

1020
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,020
I had a city controller trying
to save my job, and he owed me.

1021
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:04,930
He has 10 times the juice you have

1022
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:06,090
And he got nothing done.

1023
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,450
He has 10 times the juice,

1024
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:11,440
But I have one more picture.

1025
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:26,630
That's aceveda.

1026
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:29,300
Where did you get this?

1027
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:31,900
When was it taken?

1028
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:34,420
Gun to his head.

1029
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:37,670
Rather than stand up like
a man to his attackers,

1030
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:38,690
He gets on his knees

1031
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:40,840
And takes a man's dick in his mouth.

1032
00:47:44,010 --> 00:47:45,880
Don't think that'll play
too well with the voters.

1033
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:49,190
Except maybe in west hollywood.

1034
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:51,080
Use it any way you want,

1035
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:53,080
So long as it doesn't come back to me.

1036
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:56,490
Save your job...

1037
00:47:59,050 --> 00:47:59,970
But stop digging.

1038
00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:01,740
Right now.

1039
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:08,160
Welcome to www.1000fr.Com
