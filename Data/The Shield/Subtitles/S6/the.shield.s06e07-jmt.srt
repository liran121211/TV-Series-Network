00:00:00,306 --> 00:00:01,950
<i>Previously on "The Shield"...</i>

2
00:00:02,313 --> 00:00:04,438
My detectives found 12 bodies
hacked to pieces.

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,140
Well, 11 bodies, one arm.

4
00:00:06,242 --> 00:00:08,127
Machete is the weapon of choice
for the salvadorans.

5
00:00:08,227 --> 00:00:10,814
It supports the tip that Aceveda's
cronies gave us

6
00:00:10,916 --> 00:00:14,423
that the killers were salvadorans.
The victims were all mexican illegals.

7
00:00:14,523 --> 00:00:16,054
- Ids?
- All but the arm.

8
00:00:16,154 --> 00:00:18,777
The guy at I.N.S. ID'ed the arm
from San Marcos house.

9
00:00:18,908 --> 00:00:21,934
Eduardo Romero... a mid-level bureaucrat
in the mexican government.

10
00:00:22,051 --> 00:00:24,568
Could embarrass a lot of powerful people
on both sides of the border.

11
00:00:24,752 --> 00:00:27,836
You solve this, that's a dozen murders
in the win column.

12
00:00:27,999 --> 00:00:30,153
It just might be enough.
This door is open.

13
00:00:30,342 --> 00:00:31,972
What do you know about
a guy named Hernan?

14
00:00:32,074 --> 00:00:34,911
He's a fed... undercover in the
salvadoran organization.

15
00:00:35,017 --> 00:00:36,748
Benjamin Westcott Gilroy.

16
00:00:36,923 --> 00:00:39,687
The mexican authorities sent him back.

17
00:00:39,847 --> 00:00:41,317
- Any family?
- Wife.

18
00:00:41,582 --> 00:00:42,848
I killed Lem.

19
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:46,704
Please forgive me, please!
I can't! I can't do this any more.

20
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:47,853
I'm sorry.

21
00:00:48,031 --> 00:00:50,417
You dropped a grenade in his lap.
And what did you do? Did you run?

22
00:00:50,548 --> 00:00:51,348
Shane?!

23
00:00:52,716 --> 00:00:55,088
I did what I thought
had to be done at the time.

24
00:00:55,339 --> 00:00:56,678
He wouldn't go to Mexico.

25
00:00:56,778 --> 00:00:58,642
I told him about the money
that we were gonna send him.

26
00:00:58,744 --> 00:01:01,625
- And he never turned on us!
- We couldn't afford to take that chance.

27
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:05,548
I mean, all I was doing
was following your game plan, coach.

28
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:07,850
Get in your truck, drive away.

29
00:01:08,054 --> 00:01:10,091
Leave here before I kill you.

30
00:02:21,946 --> 00:02:24,943
I called you all last night. Did you
talk to Shane? What happened?

31
00:02:25,572 --> 00:02:26,634
He did it.

32
00:02:27,784 --> 00:02:29,108
He killed Lem.

33
00:02:32,559 --> 00:02:33,752
Oh, Jesus Christ.

34
00:02:36,677 --> 00:02:37,783
He confessed?

35
00:02:37,918 --> 00:02:41,846
He pocketed a grenade before
Aceveda's even told us about Lem's deal.

36
00:02:42,152 --> 00:02:43,723
He looked him right in the eye,

37
00:02:44,189 --> 00:02:46,153
dropped it in his lap, and ran.

38
00:02:46,593 --> 00:02:49,095
Never included us, never talked to us.
Just...

39
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,515
took it on himself and killed a guy
who was only looking out for us.

40
00:02:55,816 --> 00:02:57,097
Where is he now?

41
00:02:57,737 --> 00:02:58,770
Oh, no.

42
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:03,150
It's over. He's... He's never coming
back. He's moved on.

43
00:03:08,662 --> 00:03:10,161
Are we here for Hernan?

44
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:12,634
He called a meeting,
said it was important.

45
00:03:21,531 --> 00:03:24,078
Reaching out to me is a
big risk to your cover.

46
00:03:24,223 --> 00:03:24,988
I know.

47
00:03:25,088 --> 00:03:28,748
When I went to upload Zinman on the
spare arm you guys found at San Marcos,

48
00:03:28,868 --> 00:03:30,716
I was met by some new guy.

49
00:03:31,516 --> 00:03:32,331
Talbert.

50
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:35,575
They gave you a new handler midstream?
Yeah.

51
00:03:35,746 --> 00:03:37,624
This guy knew the arm
belonged to Romero.

52
00:03:37,749 --> 00:03:39,970
Told me to leave it alone.
End of conversation.

53
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,508
A mexican official loses a limb in a
hacked up pile of dead mexi illegals

54
00:03:44,727 --> 00:03:47,794
and the U.S. and mexican governments
both turned a blind eye?

55
00:03:47,934 --> 00:03:49,436
I've seen this shit go down before.

56
00:03:49,561 --> 00:03:52,972
Some fairway up the food chain is
getting greased. Keep it off the books.

57
00:03:53,137 --> 00:03:55,765
Brings in his own overseer...
Keeps everyone else in the dark.

58
00:03:55,953 --> 00:03:59,285
If you don't trust who you tell it to
then you're lost undercover.

59
00:03:59,511 --> 00:04:02,140
Well, until I know more,
I need a lifeline.

60
00:04:10,533 --> 00:04:13,616
Throway cell phone.
Number can't be traced to anybody.

61
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,217
- You need me, you call me.
- Salvadorans are promoting.

62
00:04:16,317 --> 00:04:18,278
I could use a push to captain.

63
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,344
Get my own crew, open me up to
a whole lot of gang secrets.

64
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,331
Well, how big of a push do you need?

65
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,858
Boss has a meeting at
Lonya's bar on ninth.

66
00:04:27,188 --> 00:04:29,049
Need a raid at 2:00 sharp.

67
00:04:29,237 --> 00:04:30,739
Well, what am I gonna find?

68
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,461
Nothing. I'm gonna tip them off
20 minutes before you show.

69
00:04:33,571 --> 00:04:35,996
- Tell them I've got a mole in the P.D.
- Hmm.

70
00:04:36,371 --> 00:04:37,983
We'll come and knock.

71
00:04:42,473 --> 00:04:43,334
Let's go!

72
00:04:43,772 --> 00:04:44,664
What's up?!

73
00:04:44,836 --> 00:04:47,026
We got a street fair
filled with confetti and dead bodies.

74
00:04:47,198 --> 00:04:49,842
Got 6 shot up at the
el salvador del mundo festival.

75
00:04:49,983 --> 00:04:52,439
4 dead, multiple injuries,
women and children.

76
00:04:52,697 --> 00:04:54,614
I was waiting to see what the
mexican payback would be

77
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,475
- for the San Marcos murders.
- City tactical?

78
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,899
No, we're on our own, man.

79
00:04:58,681 --> 00:05:01,216
Oh, Shane called in sick today.
He ok?

80
00:05:01,372 --> 00:05:02,999
Seemed fine last night.

81
00:05:10,775 --> 00:05:12,653
Unis are outnumbered.
Help them out.

82
00:05:12,825 --> 00:05:15,031
Spoke to 3 witnesses.
All tell the same stories.

83
00:05:15,171 --> 00:05:16,975
6 mexican bangers stroll
in wearing backpacks.

84
00:05:17,075 --> 00:05:19,232
- All wearing Byz Lat ink.
- Only nobody pays any attention

85
00:05:19,341 --> 00:05:21,829
till they pull out sawed-off shotguns
and start shooting at everybody.

86
00:05:21,992 --> 00:05:24,026
salvadoran bangers sponsored this fair.

87
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:26,874
This looks like retaliation
for the San Marcos house murders.

88
00:05:27,023 --> 00:05:30,011
Hernan said the el salvadorans
had nothing to do with San Marcos.

89
00:05:30,183 --> 00:05:32,154
- It was an internal mexican beef.
- Well, he's wrong.

90
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:35,432
- This smells like payback.
- Bad intel on his part.

91
00:05:36,105 --> 00:05:37,044
He lied.

92
00:05:37,231 --> 00:05:39,969
Hey, hey! Step back! Hey!
Hey, ma'am! Hey!

93
00:05:40,892 --> 00:05:42,926
My son! My son was shot!

94
00:05:43,411 --> 00:05:45,570
Let me see him! No!

95
00:05:45,742 --> 00:05:48,644
Look, I'm sorry. You're gonna have to
stay behind the line, ok?

96
00:05:52,859 --> 00:05:56,473
We need to talk to Hernan and find out
why he lied to us about San Marcos.

97
00:05:56,629 --> 00:05:59,054
The salvadorans are close to
giving him his captain's stripes.

98
00:05:59,195 --> 00:06:01,605
He must not want local law
turning up the heat on him.

99
00:06:01,755 --> 00:06:03,632
It's stepping on his upward mobility.

100
00:06:03,851 --> 00:06:06,026
- Plus, he's nervous.
- About what?

101
00:06:07,802 --> 00:06:10,290
We got a buddy at I.N.S.
Who IDed the chopped off arm

102
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:13,535
that we found at the San Marcos house.
It belongs to Eduardo Romero.

103
00:06:13,692 --> 00:06:17,314
- He's a midlevel mexican bureaucrat.
- Hernan contacted me this morning.

104
00:06:17,455 --> 00:06:21,209
He's nervous because I.C.E. is telling
him to back away from the Romero trail.

105
00:06:21,405 --> 00:06:23,853
sounds like somebody in immigration
has got their feet to the fire

106
00:06:23,994 --> 00:06:25,747
- doesn't want to get burned.
- Hernan's spooked.

107
00:06:25,903 --> 00:06:28,562
He reached out to me because
he doesn't trust his chain of command.

108
00:06:28,734 --> 00:06:31,488
That doesn't mean we have to back off.
You run with that Romero lead.

109
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:33,804
It might be the break we need
in the San Marcos case.

110
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:35,729
Find the Byz Lats who shot
up the festival.

111
00:06:35,885 --> 00:06:39,108
Hernan wants us to raid
a salvadoran bar this afternoon.

112
00:06:39,295 --> 00:06:41,752
He's gonna give the bosses an early
heads-up. Earn points by

113
00:06:41,877 --> 00:06:43,066
keeping them out of harm's way.

114
00:06:43,191 --> 00:06:44,584
Salvadoran bosses are already

115
00:06:44,724 --> 00:06:46,915
planning a retaliation.
We need to bring them in now.

116
00:06:47,063 --> 00:06:49,988
- Going in early could set Hernan back.
- He set us back

117
00:06:50,145 --> 00:06:53,572
by lying about San Marcos
being mexican on mexican.

118
00:06:54,611 --> 00:06:56,627
He can gain favor with
the bosses some other way.

119
00:06:56,727 --> 00:06:58,132
Captain Wyms?!

120
00:06:59,345 --> 00:07:02,646
Uh, I know the street festival
thing looks bad.

121
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,149
I got the Strike Team and my
best detectives on it.

122
00:07:05,305 --> 00:07:07,871
San Marcos is still unsolved, now this?

123
00:07:08,137 --> 00:07:10,233
Wilshire and Central agreed
to lend a hand.

124
00:07:10,655 --> 00:07:12,721
I don't recall asking them for help.

125
00:07:12,893 --> 00:07:15,615
Send copies of everything you have on
the street fair shooting and San Marcos

126
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,243
so Wilshire and Central can back you up.

127
00:07:21,264 --> 00:07:24,095
- Shane here?
- No. I haven't seen him.

128
00:07:24,268 --> 00:07:25,926
He didn't come home last night.

129
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:28,773
- Everything all right between you two?
- Where the hell is he?

130
00:07:29,242 --> 00:07:30,463
I'll be right out.

131
00:07:34,417 --> 00:07:36,768
I don't know where Shane is.
Maybe you should ask the captain.

132
00:07:36,932 --> 00:07:38,559
- She might be able to help you.
- He doesn't do anything

133
00:07:38,731 --> 00:07:41,360
without you knowing about it.
Don't dick me around here.

134
00:07:41,626 --> 00:07:43,863
I'm not.
That's his job.

135
00:07:45,412 --> 00:07:47,383
I know what happened last night.

136
00:07:49,948 --> 00:07:52,921
It was a busy evening.
You'll have to be more specific.

137
00:07:55,393 --> 00:07:56,566
About Lem.

138
00:07:58,006 --> 00:07:59,195
What about Lem?

139
00:08:03,826 --> 00:08:07,096
- If you did anything to hurt Shane...
- Why would I hurt Shane?

140
00:08:07,847 --> 00:08:09,396
What is it you think you know?

141
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:11,258
I know everything about Shane.

142
00:08:11,602 --> 00:08:13,354
We don't have any secrets.

143
00:08:14,363 --> 00:08:14,989
Oh.

144
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,181
Open and honest.

145
00:08:18,922 --> 00:08:21,263
That's always the best way, right?

148
00:08:39,783 --> 00:08:40,644
Hey!

149
00:08:52,028 --> 00:08:54,391
God damn it!
Bosses got out of here in a hurry.

150
00:08:54,548 --> 00:08:55,768
waitress said they all took off when

151
00:08:55,909 --> 00:08:57,818
they heard about the
street fair shooting.

152
00:08:58,006 --> 00:09:00,352
Hernan knew we'd come
early for the bosses.

153
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,261
He's pulled them out early
to gain trust.

154
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,874
I'm beginning to think this guy
is kind of an asshole.

155
00:09:05,093 --> 00:09:06,626
Let's flip it.

156
00:09:42,685 --> 00:09:43,405
Yeah?

157
00:09:43,671 --> 00:09:45,939
Hey, sorry I missed your yamada, amigo.

158
00:09:46,143 --> 00:09:47,739
Still need them smokes.

159
00:09:47,937 --> 00:09:49,298
You with the bosses?

160
00:09:49,626 --> 00:09:51,160
There a retaliation plan?

161
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,397
Si, los Macanudos and los Dukes.

162
00:09:54,977 --> 00:09:58,200
Not the regs.
That shit burns like garbage.

163
00:09:59,475 --> 00:10:02,229
- Garbage.
- She got them in stock, eh?

164
00:10:16,528 --> 00:10:18,092
Found your cigars.

165
00:10:18,343 --> 00:10:20,048
These the addresses for the bosses?

166
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,098
Why not put two aside for me, eh?
Don't forget me, ay?

167
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:26,759
- Pick you up with the rest of them.
- Si, amigo. Buenos noches.

168
00:10:30,218 --> 00:10:33,675
I take back the asshole comment
about Hernan. He came through.

169
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:36,116
Wants us to scoop him up
with the rest of the bosses.

170
00:10:36,381 --> 00:10:38,446
Preserves his cover,
gets the shot-callers off the street.

171
00:10:38,635 --> 00:10:41,818
- Buys us some time to make a peace.
- Yeah, but the shooters were Byz Lat.

172
00:10:42,006 --> 00:10:43,774
Just picking up the
salvadorians might raise

173
00:10:43,931 --> 00:10:45,808
suspicions that we've got a guy inside.

174
00:10:46,277 --> 00:10:47,576
Gang sweep.

175
00:10:47,858 --> 00:10:50,251
Wide net.
Salvadorans and mexicans.

176
00:10:50,439 --> 00:10:53,380
Hernan's just another sad brown face
in the paddy wagon...

177
00:10:53,662 --> 00:10:55,054
Until we get him along.

178
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,888
How can I help with the fallout?

179
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:03,909
Phillips had me send over our case files
to Wilshire and Central.

180
00:11:04,934 --> 00:11:07,054
Our stats are tanking.
He's gonna shut this place down.

181
00:11:07,195 --> 00:11:09,651
- No, I would have heard something.
- He's bringing them up to speed

182
00:11:09,792 --> 00:11:11,654
so that when they split
the farm in half,

183
00:11:11,842 --> 00:11:14,173
the transition goes smoothly.

184
00:11:14,446 --> 00:11:17,262
And keeping it under the radar.
Protect morale.

185
00:11:17,849 --> 00:11:21,166
It's hard to motivate cops
when your home base is a sinking ship.

186
00:11:21,424 --> 00:11:23,427
I'll look into it on a policy level.

187
00:11:24,053 --> 00:11:25,523
How can I help right now?

188
00:11:25,805 --> 00:11:27,761
Those extra bodies you
threatened to spoil us with,

189
00:11:27,886 --> 00:11:29,388
- I need them tonight.
- For what?

190
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:30,913
Gang sweep.

191
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:34,011
Gonna bring in as many Byz Lat
salvadoran bangers as we can.

192
00:11:34,144 --> 00:11:36,318
It gives us time to find the shooters,
negotiate a peace.

193
00:11:36,428 --> 00:11:39,033
The mexican and salvadoran
communities both feel victimized.

194
00:11:39,174 --> 00:11:40,519
It sounds punitive.

195
00:11:40,746 --> 00:11:44,109
It's a warrant sweep. It's bringing
felons in from the front lines.

196
00:11:44,266 --> 00:11:45,674
It'll feel like a siege.

197
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:50,907
I.C.E. has an undercover operative

198
00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:54,130
high up the salvadoran food chain
I need to protect.

199
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:57,619
I gotta pick him up without
anyone getting wise.

200
00:11:57,885 --> 00:11:59,371
He can help us end this.

201
00:12:01,531 --> 00:12:03,189
4-screen movie theater.

202
00:12:03,878 --> 00:12:05,708
Restaurants, shopping.

203
00:12:06,052 --> 00:12:09,557
Walking distance from our low-income
housing. A medical center...

204
00:12:09,932 --> 00:12:11,465
It sounds like a community.

205
00:12:12,138 --> 00:12:14,094
These people work hard for their money.

206
00:12:14,563 --> 00:12:17,567
Shouldn't have to bus to
Beverly Hills to spend it.

207
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,486
Hey, did you hear about the
street fair shooting?

208
00:12:21,861 --> 00:12:23,817
Oh, yes.
It's awful.

209
00:12:24,005 --> 00:12:27,635
Yeah, looks like Byz Lat retaliation
for the San Marcos house murders.

210
00:12:28,785 --> 00:12:31,037
Why am I not surprised?

211
00:12:31,773 --> 00:12:34,057
Captain Wyms is planning a gang sweep.

212
00:12:34,464 --> 00:12:36,404
Everyone with an outstanding warrant,

213
00:12:36,764 --> 00:12:38,500
mexicanos, salvadorans...

214
00:12:39,853 --> 00:12:41,808
A blitzkrieg against latinos.

215
00:12:42,309 --> 00:12:44,233
A preemptive safety measure.

216
00:12:44,468 --> 00:12:47,503
We're getting gang members
off the street. Keep the community safe.

217
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,373
And between my media contacts
and your community and commercial clout,

218
00:12:51,576 --> 00:12:55,957
we convince the press, the
neighborhood, that we're here to help.

219
00:12:56,461 --> 00:12:58,823
These people, they...
They don't see us latinos.

220
00:12:58,995 --> 00:13:01,733
They see a developer and a former cop.

221
00:13:02,578 --> 00:13:03,798
The Barn's at risk.

222
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,333
If captain Wyms doesn't reduce
your crime stats,

223
00:13:06,505 --> 00:13:08,523
it goes away, which means less cops
in our district.

224
00:13:08,726 --> 00:13:10,995
So, what good is all this if we
can't protect it...

225
00:13:11,214 --> 00:13:12,794
Or the people who come here?

226
00:13:14,108 --> 00:13:16,987
Salvadoranio women and children
were injured today.

227
00:13:17,221 --> 00:13:20,225
A sweep of their community...
It's not protection.

228
00:13:20,601 --> 00:13:21,711
It's an assault.

229
00:13:25,436 --> 00:13:27,423
There's an operative inside the
salvadorans

230
00:13:27,579 --> 00:13:29,879
who can help solve the
street fair shooting,

231
00:13:30,606 --> 00:13:32,805
but we need to pick him up
without casting suspicion.

232
00:13:32,961 --> 00:13:34,792
A gang sweep protects his cover.

233
00:13:35,596 --> 00:13:37,411
I can't spin this alone, man.

234
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:40,697
Can you help me sell this?

235
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,056
Tell me what to do.

236
00:13:51,294 --> 00:13:52,953
Hey, buddy.
Ha!

237
00:13:53,797 --> 00:13:56,989
Did you miss me?
Oh, you missed me!

238
00:13:58,008 --> 00:13:59,729
What do you think?

239
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,920
Where the hell have you been?

240
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:04,486
I just been driving, thinking.

241
00:14:04,736 --> 00:14:08,460
Maybe you were getting your dick sucked
by your under-age nubian whore?

242
00:14:08,686 --> 00:14:09,906
Hey, watch your mouth.

243
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:12,128
It's my mouth I'm worried about.

244
00:14:12,629 --> 00:14:14,616
Don't throw that shit in my face.

245
00:14:14,992 --> 00:14:16,400
I left you a message.

246
00:14:16,728 --> 00:14:18,199
I said not to wait up.

247
00:14:18,433 --> 00:14:19,138
Yeah?

248
00:14:19,763 --> 00:14:21,782
That was 24 hours ago.

249
00:14:22,093 --> 00:14:23,963
- And you know what? I'm still up.
- Mara, my cell died.

250
00:14:24,135 --> 00:14:26,983
- I couldn't get to a phone.
- I didn't know what happened to you!

251
00:14:27,452 --> 00:14:28,359
I'm sorry.

252
00:14:28,891 --> 00:14:29,940
I'm ok.

253
00:14:30,378 --> 00:14:32,240
I was just figuring some shit out.

254
00:14:32,435 --> 00:14:35,924
- Ok? I promise. I promise.
- I'm so freaked out.

255
00:14:37,097 --> 00:14:38,631
I went to Vic.

256
00:14:39,374 --> 00:14:40,884
I... But I didn't believe him

257
00:14:41,032 --> 00:14:42,816
- when he told me...
- You talked to Vic?

258
00:14:43,285 --> 00:14:45,992
When you didn't come home,
I went to the Barn looking for you.

259
00:14:46,813 --> 00:14:48,237
Well, what did you say to him?

260
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:50,662
I just asked him where you were.

261
00:14:51,851 --> 00:14:54,073
He scared the shit out of me.

262
00:14:55,512 --> 00:14:57,374
Well, why would he scare you, Mara?

263
00:14:58,602 --> 00:15:00,245
Mara, what did you say to him?

264
00:15:00,542 --> 00:15:03,139
- I... I don't know.
- Did you say anything about Lem?

265
00:15:04,015 --> 00:15:04,829
Did you?

266
00:15:09,624 --> 00:15:11,893
I think he might have figured it out.

267
00:15:12,769 --> 00:15:14,068
God damn it.

268
00:15:15,351 --> 00:15:16,915
What else, Mara?

269
00:15:17,275 --> 00:15:18,871
What else did you say to him?

270
00:15:19,058 --> 00:15:21,233
- Huh?!
- I told him we didn't have any secrets.

271
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:22,218
Ugh!

272
00:15:25,598 --> 00:15:27,053
You know who this guy is?

273
00:15:27,553 --> 00:15:28,633
What he's done?

274
00:15:28,883 --> 00:15:32,357
The shit he can do, Mara, not just to
me, but to you and Jacks? Huh?

275
00:15:32,826 --> 00:15:33,999
What's he done?

276
00:15:35,681 --> 00:15:36,823
The two of you?

277
00:15:37,801 --> 00:15:40,868
What else have you done, Shane?
Huh?!

278
00:15:41,337 --> 00:15:42,855
- What?!
- Enough!

279
00:15:47,188 --> 00:15:48,972
Is he gonna tell them about Lem?

280
00:15:49,723 --> 00:15:52,116
- Will they send you to prison?
- He's not gonna say anything.

281
00:15:52,304 --> 00:15:53,587
You can't go to jail.

282
00:15:53,798 --> 00:15:57,162
He's not gonna say anything to anybody
because I know everything he's done.

283
00:15:59,762 --> 00:16:01,311
So, you're a threat to him.

284
00:16:01,887 --> 00:16:04,374
Oh, God.
We gotta get out of here.

285
00:16:04,624 --> 00:16:07,206
- We gotta get out of L.A....
- I know. I put a call in...

286
00:16:07,409 --> 00:16:09,866
This morning to vice
to try to get my spot back.

287
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,556
I'll work for a year or so.
I'll squirrel away

288
00:16:12,744 --> 00:16:14,481
enough for us to get out of here.

289
00:16:14,794 --> 00:16:15,873
I just gotta...

290
00:16:16,147 --> 00:16:18,025
Take some precautions first.

291
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:19,824
What do you mean?

292
00:16:20,371 --> 00:16:23,312
Listen to me: I don't want you
to say anything, ok, just listen.

293
00:16:23,907 --> 00:16:26,301
I want you to pack a bag for you
and Jackson,

294
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:29,031
just light, but enough to
live on for awhile.

295
00:16:29,219 --> 00:16:31,394
- What are you gonna...
- No, just listen to me.

296
00:16:31,675 --> 00:16:33,615
All right, this is just a backup plan.

297
00:16:33,865 --> 00:16:36,196
Just in case we gotta get out of
here in a hurry.

298
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:37,339
Ok?

299
00:16:42,245 --> 00:16:43,293
Oh, shit.

300
00:16:43,982 --> 00:16:44,842
I um...

301
00:16:45,187 --> 00:16:47,080
I'm supposed to see Corrine tomorrow.

302
00:16:47,314 --> 00:16:49,160
She's gonna give us some baby stuff.

303
00:16:49,552 --> 00:16:51,054
You know what? That's good.

304
00:16:51,482 --> 00:16:53,344
That's good. Make a day out of it.

305
00:16:55,745 --> 00:16:59,984
Vic won't do anything to us
when we're with his wife and kid, right?

306
00:17:04,954 --> 00:17:06,018
Our two key targets:

307
00:17:06,221 --> 00:17:09,741
Octavio Menez, he's calling shots for
the salvadorans while guardo's M.I.A.

308
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,822
SWAT, you'll all about him, ok?

309
00:17:12,104 --> 00:17:15,812
My team's on Santi Galas, who's next in
line as the Byz Lat C.E.O. Captain?

310
00:17:16,075 --> 00:17:18,892
Ok, the rest of you, know your man
and your location.

311
00:17:19,158 --> 00:17:22,678
- We'll move to set positions in 15 mins.
- These scumbags are with family,

312
00:17:22,882 --> 00:17:25,948
that means elderly and kids.
So, safety off, but easy on the trigger.

313
00:17:26,167 --> 00:17:27,137
- Let's go.
- Ok!

314
00:17:28,983 --> 00:17:29,765
Ronnie?

315
00:17:30,673 --> 00:17:32,159
Ronnie, you're bringing in Hernan.

316
00:17:32,347 --> 00:17:34,850
They know Mackey. We need a new face.
We already surveilled his apartment.

317
00:17:35,022 --> 00:17:36,915
He lives with two other bangers,
so hit him hard.

318
00:17:37,118 --> 00:17:38,667
Bedroom is on the southeast side.

319
00:17:38,918 --> 00:17:40,685
Agent Talbert, I.C.E.

320
00:17:41,506 --> 00:17:43,314
You can't run an op involving
one of my men without

321
00:17:43,517 --> 00:17:45,300
coordinating through my office.

322
00:17:45,551 --> 00:17:48,508
Uh, this op is time-sensitive. We didn't
have time to run it by Washington.

323
00:17:48,719 --> 00:17:51,958
Look, we got a pretty tight lid on this.
But we do need the contact password.

324
00:17:52,177 --> 00:17:53,929
- I'm not signing off.
- Then don't.

325
00:17:54,109 --> 00:17:57,160
- We'll do it with or without your help.
- I'm putting a stop to this.

326
00:17:57,442 --> 00:17:59,726
A fed suit's swarming a local
warrant sweep?

327
00:17:59,961 --> 00:18:01,963
Might as well paint the
bull's eye on Hernan's back.

328
00:18:02,245 --> 00:18:04,482
And we don't answer to your bosses.
Let's go.

329
00:18:05,413 --> 00:18:06,086
Shit.

330
00:18:06,899 --> 00:18:07,635
Hey.

331
00:18:09,997 --> 00:18:11,734
Password's "honeycomb".

332
00:18:12,226 --> 00:18:14,854
He calls you off for any reason,
you let him go.

333
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:16,090
All right.

334
00:18:26,261 --> 00:18:28,389
Take your positions.
Move on my signal.

335
00:18:30,164 --> 00:18:31,008
Let's go.

336
00:18:38,995 --> 00:18:40,043
Go! Go!

337
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,793
Police! Freeze!

338
00:18:46,506 --> 00:18:48,289
- "Honeycomb".
- Let me see your hands!

339
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:53,671
Por favor. No dispare.

340
00:18:53,858 --> 00:18:54,953
Donde esta Santi?

341
00:18:55,329 --> 00:18:56,252
Donde?!

342
00:18:56,862 --> 00:18:58,192
Muevase!

343
00:18:58,458 --> 00:18:59,662
God damn it!

344
00:19:00,022 --> 00:19:01,430
Santi's out the back!

345
00:19:03,949 --> 00:19:05,983
- Police!
- Go, go, go!

346
00:19:13,344 --> 00:19:14,549
Don't move!

347
00:19:16,223 --> 00:19:18,225
Huh.
Godspeed.

348
00:19:35,482 --> 00:19:38,314
- Can I help you?
- Uh, Shane Vendrell.

349
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:42,851
- One of Vic's guys.
- Can I talk to you for a minute?

350
00:19:44,493 --> 00:19:45,839
A minute. Yeah.

351
00:19:49,899 --> 00:19:52,762
- What do you need?
- A few weeks ago, you gave...

352
00:19:52,997 --> 00:19:55,563
Vic some information about your
late husband...

353
00:19:56,752 --> 00:19:58,535
Regarding Ben's time in Mexico...

354
00:19:58,903 --> 00:20:00,170
People he knew down there.

355
00:20:00,405 --> 00:20:03,033
Vic said he need that stuff
to close out Ben's case.

356
00:20:03,315 --> 00:20:04,050
Right.

357
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:07,101
Well, I'm actually working on a
similar thing and...

358
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:10,855
And I'm gonna have to get those facts
from you as well, if you don't mind.

359
00:20:13,718 --> 00:20:15,408
What case are you working?
What is this?

360
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:17,059
I can't discuss the details
with you, ma'am.

361
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:19,754
But you're gonna have to turn
over that information.

362
00:20:20,289 --> 00:20:23,105
I don't want to have to file
a failure to cooperate charge.

363
00:20:24,334 --> 00:20:26,508
I was married to a cop
for 20 years, asshole.

364
00:20:26,727 --> 00:20:29,418
Don't threaten me with bullshit charges.
Get out of here!

365
00:20:29,669 --> 00:20:31,499
Your daughters know the truth
about their father?

366
00:20:31,718 --> 00:20:33,517
What?
They know he ripped off the city?

367
00:20:33,736 --> 00:20:35,770
Disgraced the badge for some
dirty latina snatch?

368
00:20:35,989 --> 00:20:37,820
- Shut up!
- They know he choked on his own puke?

369
00:20:38,007 --> 00:20:40,573
And died a poor miserable drunk
in some mexi shithole?

370
00:20:41,059 --> 00:20:44,423
Those autopsy photos are brutal.
You want your daughters to see them?

371
00:20:49,004 --> 00:20:51,257
I want those mexican money
contacts by tonight

372
00:20:51,508 --> 00:20:53,839
or I show and tell your girls
the whole ugly truth.

373
00:20:54,073 --> 00:20:55,685
I'll show myself out.

374
00:21:04,205 --> 00:21:06,654
look, man, we know why you lied
about San Marcos

375
00:21:06,881 --> 00:21:09,799
- being an internal mexican beef.
- What we don't know is the truth.

376
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:14,821
Mexicans got something big brewing.

377
00:21:15,087 --> 00:21:17,637
Byz Lats are working the cartel
outside of Mexico city.

378
00:21:17,856 --> 00:21:19,655
The salvadorans want a piece of it.

379
00:21:20,469 --> 00:21:24,051
Chopping up the bodies at San Marcos was
all about sending a message to share.

380
00:21:24,263 --> 00:21:25,248
Share what?

381
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,799
Only the captains know that.

382
00:21:28,143 --> 00:21:29,770
That's why I need that favor.

383
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,398
- Gotta earn my stripes.
- And the missing limb

384
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:34,448
of a mexican government official?

385
00:21:34,847 --> 00:21:36,568
I don't know how that got in the mix.

386
00:21:36,802 --> 00:21:39,791
We can't afford a retaliation
for the street fair shooting.

387
00:21:40,307 --> 00:21:43,827
You need to mediate a peace between
the salvadoran bosses and Byz Lats.

388
00:21:44,234 --> 00:21:46,596
There's no peace
without the shooters paying a price.

389
00:21:47,214 --> 00:21:48,583
I don't make the rules.

390
00:21:48,896 --> 00:21:51,556
If we get the shooters, dump
them in chino,

391
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:54,512
let the salvadorans celebrate
with a little shiv-fest,

392
00:21:54,865 --> 00:21:57,634
you think you could convince
the salvadoran grand poobah

393
00:21:57,822 --> 00:21:59,965
to let that satisfy his blood lust?

394
00:22:00,355 --> 00:22:02,233
Nah. Octavio's not going to
promote me to captain

395
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,954
if I'm running around
talking like Gandhi.

396
00:22:04,188 --> 00:22:05,675
Then talk like trump, man.

397
00:22:05,934 --> 00:22:09,282
Tell him it's about settling the beef
so everyone can get back to business.

398
00:22:09,547 --> 00:22:10,924
I'll see what I can do.

399
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:14,100
you know who the salvadorans were, who
were swinging the machetes at San Marcos?

400
00:22:14,342 --> 00:22:17,127
No, I don't. And it would be the
death of my cover if I started asking.

401
00:22:17,354 --> 00:22:19,216
Salvadorans are closing ranks.

402
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:22,220
It's getting too dangerous
for you to be out there.

403
00:22:23,283 --> 00:22:25,755
I just spent 6 months in a
salvadoran lockup...

404
00:22:26,068 --> 00:22:27,993
Two years out here with these animals.

405
00:22:28,227 --> 00:22:30,011
You're not pulling me out of this.

406
00:22:30,731 --> 00:22:33,077
If he can help settle this beef,

407
00:22:33,398 --> 00:22:34,759
earn his stripes,

408
00:22:34,993 --> 00:22:36,445
it could give us a front row seat

409
00:22:36,545 --> 00:22:38,732
to whatever it is the mexi gangs
have brewing.

410
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:42,684
Ok.

411
00:22:43,857 --> 00:22:45,031
Need a minute.

412
00:22:49,943 --> 00:22:53,213
Got a call from vice.
Shane's put in for his old position.

413
00:22:54,605 --> 00:22:59,001
Makes sense.
Lem gone, me being forced out maybe...

414
00:22:59,658 --> 00:23:02,021
- It's the right move.
- So, you didn't know about it.

415
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,852
He also requested two weeks
unpaid leave...

416
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,683
Same amount of time you might
have left here.

417
00:23:06,824 --> 00:23:10,359
- This news bulletin have a point?
- His down time is gonna be denied.

418
00:23:10,868 --> 00:23:13,246
It'll take two weeks to
process his request.

419
00:23:13,974 --> 00:23:15,562
Means you'll still be working together.

420
00:23:15,671 --> 00:23:17,251
Fine.
Then let me get back at it.

421
00:23:17,455 --> 00:23:19,111
Don't leave me hanging here, Mackey.

422
00:23:19,211 --> 00:23:21,773
If something happened between you two
that affects the job,

423
00:23:22,008 --> 00:23:23,682
- I need to know.
- What affects the job

424
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:25,716
is our friend getting blown to shit.

425
00:23:26,224 --> 00:23:29,079
Now, you got a problem with Shane,
you take it up with his new team leader.

426
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:31,082
I'm just a hired hand here now.

427
00:23:34,555 --> 00:23:37,434
The Byz Lats and the salvadorans
were playing nice together.

428
00:23:38,075 --> 00:23:40,187
Paid them to protect your drug run.

429
00:23:40,515 --> 00:23:41,251
Come on, Santi.

430
00:23:41,392 --> 00:23:44,333
Don't you Byz Lat assholes know
you gotta get along with these psychos?

431
00:23:44,474 --> 00:23:46,805
Either that or get a grenade
shoved up your ass.

432
00:23:46,993 --> 00:23:50,326
- Ain't nothing up my ass except you.
- Yeah? Well, how am I feeling?

433
00:23:50,592 --> 00:23:53,783
If these street fair shooters
were to go down,

434
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:56,302
Well, it would make your life
a whole lot easier...

435
00:23:57,263 --> 00:23:59,157
Not to mention more profitable.

436
00:23:59,595 --> 00:24:02,223
Blood's gonna keep spilling
unless they feel vindicated.

437
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:06,612
I mean, you better settle this soon, or
you're gonna have nothing left to run.

438
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,662
We know who the salvadorans were

439
00:24:20,771 --> 00:24:23,540
who hacked up your illegal cousins
at San Marcos.

440
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:26,747
We were just waiting for
some I.N.S. red tape to clear,

441
00:24:26,888 --> 00:24:29,290
then were gonna pick them up
in a few days. But...

442
00:24:29,633 --> 00:24:32,371
maybe these guys get lost
on the way back to the Barn.

443
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:36,596
End up in a bad neighborhood somehow.

444
00:24:38,051 --> 00:24:39,787
You tell me where to lose them.

445
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:44,982
If I sacrifice my own guys
and give you the shooters.

446
00:24:45,654 --> 00:24:46,828
Blood for blood...

447
00:24:47,814 --> 00:24:49,581
The old-fashioned way.

448
00:24:49,777 --> 00:24:51,248
The score's even.

449
00:24:51,467 --> 00:24:54,658
The street calms down,
everybody gets back to commerce, right?

450
00:24:58,256 --> 00:24:59,821
Let me make a call.

451
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,874
That can't be traced.

452
00:25:07,768 --> 00:25:10,725
Throway phone.
Use all the minutes you need.

453
00:25:15,255 --> 00:25:16,037
Hey.

454
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:18,509
So, where exactly are we
gonna find the San Marcos killer?

455
00:25:19,072 --> 00:25:20,918
Somewhere eventually.

456
00:25:24,282 --> 00:25:25,690
That Gilroy's widow?

457
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:29,758
- Nance, everything all right?
- What the hell is your guy up to?

458
00:25:29,938 --> 00:25:32,394
What guy?
That god damn hillbilly.

459
00:25:34,537 --> 00:25:35,742
That's interesting.

460
00:25:37,776 --> 00:25:40,529
- All right, what's going on?
- He showed up at my house today.

461
00:25:40,687 --> 00:25:43,284
Wanting that information
I gave you weeks ago.

462
00:25:44,285 --> 00:25:46,022
- Ben's mexican contacts?
- Yeah.

463
00:25:46,209 --> 00:25:48,149
He said he's working on
some hush-hush case.

464
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:49,213
Nothing I know about.

465
00:25:49,698 --> 00:25:52,467
I gave you those contacts on the Q.T.
If they find out

466
00:25:52,608 --> 00:25:55,158
- that I was funneling money to him...
- No, no. They won't. They won't.

467
00:25:55,314 --> 00:25:59,632
I told I.A.D. that I dug up that intel
so they'd put Ben's case to bed...

468
00:25:59,961 --> 00:26:01,604
Leave you and the girls alone.

469
00:26:02,886 --> 00:26:06,719
So, if I put a call into I.A.D.,
they'll know what I'm talking about?

470
00:26:08,926 --> 00:26:12,118
Oh, Jesus Christ.
It never ends, does it?

471
00:26:12,274 --> 00:26:14,543
- I'll take care of Shane.
- He threatened...

472
00:26:14,746 --> 00:26:17,531
to tell my girls
all the dirty details...

473
00:26:18,038 --> 00:26:22,341
The embezzlement, the affair.
Gonna show them autopsy photos.

474
00:26:22,567 --> 00:26:24,156
I have done everything in my power

475
00:26:24,265 --> 00:26:27,019
to keep them protected from
the wreckage of that asshole!

476
00:26:27,348 --> 00:26:28,412
You rein him in, Vic...

477
00:26:28,537 --> 00:26:30,938
- or so help me god...
- No, no. I'll take care of it.

478
00:26:31,188 --> 00:26:32,440
I'm sorry.

479
00:26:33,668 --> 00:26:36,453
He's coming by tonight.
Late.

480
00:26:42,586 --> 00:26:44,182
What the hell was that about?

481
00:26:45,183 --> 00:26:47,577
Shane's getting ready for a
long, cold winter.

482
00:26:47,796 --> 00:26:50,565
He's looking for Gilroy's
mexican contacts.

483
00:26:51,136 --> 00:26:52,482
He thinks you're coming after him?

484
00:26:52,591 --> 00:26:56,878
Put in for a transfer to vice, too.
He's covering all his bases.

485
00:26:58,067 --> 00:27:00,304
We gonna be one of the
bases he tries to cover?

486
00:27:06,555 --> 00:27:08,745
- I need to talk to the baker.
- Ok.

487
00:27:18,507 --> 00:27:21,417
- I am Yezik. Can I help you?
- What the hell is this shit?

488
00:27:21,683 --> 00:27:24,171
Barazek.
No wonder you give it away for free.

489
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:26,025
It tastes like old tires.

490
00:27:27,135 --> 00:27:30,953
Hear you got some old-school guy...
Kesakian... Running your bakery now.

491
00:27:31,328 --> 00:27:34,379
- I need to chat with him.
- Don't know Kasakian.

492
00:27:36,452 --> 00:27:39,268
I see about a dozen health
violations in this room alone.

493
00:27:39,566 --> 00:27:42,006
Gives me the authority
to start opening up all your ovens.

494
00:27:42,241 --> 00:27:44,713
You sure all I'm gonna find
is half-baked barazek?

495
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:47,497
Maybe I could take a message to someone.

496
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,719
That'd be swell, Yezik.

497
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:52,660
Tell Kasakian I got a business
proposition for him.

498
00:27:52,825 --> 00:27:54,781
I'm a cop he's gonna need to know.

499
00:27:58,434 --> 00:28:01,891
Shane's...
He's just so hard to access sometimes.

500
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:06,772
Did Vic talk about the job much?

501
00:28:07,351 --> 00:28:11,075
Not really. I'd ask him about things,
try to get him to open up.

502
00:28:12,155 --> 00:28:13,891
After awhile, I stopped asking.

503
00:28:14,869 --> 00:28:16,527
Shane tells me some stuff.

504
00:28:17,044 --> 00:28:19,297
That's probably better.
It'll keep you close.

505
00:28:20,267 --> 00:28:21,440
I gotta be honest.

506
00:28:21,675 --> 00:28:23,928
Sometimes I wish he didn't
tell me anything.

507
00:28:24,162 --> 00:28:25,594
It kind of freaks me out.

508
00:28:25,766 --> 00:28:29,693
Yeah, the job sucks. Turned our
marriage bad and made him hard.

509
00:28:31,343 --> 00:28:36,036
He wasn't like that when I first
met him. He was pretty sweet actually.

510
00:28:37,398 --> 00:28:38,963
He's had a tough run.

511
00:28:39,792 --> 00:28:42,467
- The I.A.D. Charges and...
- Yeah, those were all bullshit.

512
00:28:42,812 --> 00:28:43,500
Yeah.

513
00:28:43,969 --> 00:28:46,832
He had nothing to do with Lem's murder.
I know.

514
00:28:48,866 --> 00:28:50,603
And I'm glad it got worked out.

515
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:52,402
Yeah. We all are.

516
00:28:53,403 --> 00:28:57,314
It's the...
Off-duty shit that scares me the most.

517
00:28:57,799 --> 00:28:58,628
You know?

518
00:28:59,661 --> 00:29:00,819
No, I don't.

519
00:29:02,704 --> 00:29:04,722
I'm gonna get you more juice.

520
00:29:08,649 --> 00:29:11,011
Eduardo Romero.

521
00:29:11,387 --> 00:29:13,890
Mexico's assistant secretary of
trade and export.

522
00:29:14,046 --> 00:29:16,002
Eduardo senior vice
secretary of finance.

523
00:29:16,144 --> 00:29:19,288
Hell's this guy's hacked-off
arm doing in Farmington?

524
00:29:19,539 --> 00:29:21,338
And where's the rest of the corpse?

525
00:29:22,847 --> 00:29:24,912
You... You sure you know
where you're going?

526
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:29,042
I used to troll for UCLA hotties
when I was in community college.

527
00:29:29,449 --> 00:29:32,609
Wasn't gonna take'em back to my shithole
in Alhambra, so I'd drive up here,

528
00:29:32,836 --> 00:29:35,590
- say I'm going to my folks' place.
- This worked?

529
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,588
You'd be surprised.

530
00:29:39,932 --> 00:29:43,280
- Now how'd you pull it off?
- Never went in.

531
00:29:45,439 --> 00:29:49,084
We'd find a place with the lights on.
Tell them my folks came home early.

532
00:29:49,584 --> 00:29:51,540
- We'd have to go to her place.
- Ha.

533
00:29:51,963 --> 00:29:55,483
It's amazing how quick 2 thighs spring
open when they think your folks got coin.

534
00:29:57,407 --> 00:30:00,395
Looks like Eduardo's ex
found herself a rich gringo.

535
00:30:05,418 --> 00:30:08,516
You know, Dutch, I could teach you
a few things about women, if you want.

536
00:30:12,067 --> 00:30:14,836
Why don't you write them down,
and I can read them at my leisure.

537
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,749
- Kasakian?
- I'm an associate, Ellis Rezian.

538
00:30:25,874 --> 00:30:27,970
What the hell is this shit, man?
I said I wanted to speak to Kasakian.

539
00:30:28,205 --> 00:30:28,987
Aboush mee ehlar!

540
00:30:30,458 --> 00:30:31,334
Dour indzi.

541
00:30:31,834 --> 00:30:32,898
Dour indzi.

542
00:30:35,636 --> 00:30:36,528
I'm sorry.

543
00:30:36,684 --> 00:30:39,234
You want to talk business,
we're here in good faith.

544
00:30:40,377 --> 00:30:43,616
Kasakian's insulated.
Rumors must be true.

545
00:30:44,179 --> 00:30:46,307
Old world muscle's moving
back in the hood, huh?

546
00:30:46,494 --> 00:30:50,014
I'm just try to teach our american-born
about loyalty and respect.

547
00:30:50,421 --> 00:30:53,049
Well, maybe I can help.
Set a good example.

548
00:30:57,594 --> 00:31:00,348
It's been awhile since we had a
good relationship with law enforcement.

549
00:31:00,504 --> 00:31:02,804
Yeah, well, chopping off people's feet
will strain any relationship.

550
00:31:02,929 --> 00:31:05,839
- We'd like to fix that.
- That's funny. I'm a fixer.

551
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:11,167
There's a new gas station
on Talmadge, Iraqi-owned.

552
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:14,155
Apparently they have their own
arab-based petrol supplier.

553
00:31:14,374 --> 00:31:17,628
That sounds fishy. Could be
funneling money back to Al-Qaeda.

554
00:31:17,863 --> 00:31:19,208
I better check it out.

555
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:22,775
That would give me comfort.
You and me both.

556
00:31:34,227 --> 00:31:35,823
Thanks for coming down.

557
00:31:35,964 --> 00:31:38,576
Must be important
to drive all the way out to my house.

558
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:40,947
Uh...
We just need to ask you a few questions.

559
00:31:41,197 --> 00:31:43,591
About?
Your ex-husband.

560
00:31:43,966 --> 00:31:48,456
- When was the last time you saw him?
- Years ago. Before I got remarried.

561
00:31:48,722 --> 00:31:51,131
- Still talk to him occasionally.
- Why?

562
00:31:51,303 --> 00:31:55,481
Eduardo's severed arm was found
with several other dead bodies.

563
00:31:55,716 --> 00:31:57,906
We haven't been able to locate
the rest of Eduardo yet.

564
00:31:58,094 --> 00:31:59,127
Oh, my God.

565
00:31:59,393 --> 00:32:02,976
Has anybody from the mexican government
contacted you, explain he was missing?

566
00:32:03,155 --> 00:32:05,283
No.
We're trying to piece together

567
00:32:05,517 --> 00:32:08,333
what he was doing in L.A.,
who his contacts were.

568
00:32:08,576 --> 00:32:10,344
He came up here...

569
00:32:10,751 --> 00:32:13,676
- Twice a year, maybe 3.
- You know why?

570
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:16,086
He had family interests to attend to.

571
00:32:16,492 --> 00:32:18,151
Never got specific.

572
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:20,920
Always stayed in a small
hotel in Koreatown.

573
00:32:21,546 --> 00:32:25,441
He could have afforded better,
but this place is private.

574
00:32:27,765 --> 00:32:29,548
Where are we on Romero and San Marcos?

575
00:32:29,751 --> 00:32:32,270
Eduardo Romero checked into
a hotel under an alias

576
00:32:32,411 --> 00:32:34,210
two days before they
hacked his arm off.

577
00:32:34,445 --> 00:32:37,574
That's why we couldn't find him.
Manager says he hasn't been back.

578
00:32:37,965 --> 00:32:40,938
Hotel manager gave us the plate
number of the mercedes he was driving.

579
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:44,834
It's an open-ended rental out of L.A.X.
The car hasn't be returned yet.

580
00:32:45,069 --> 00:32:47,118
Well, whoever was driving that car,

581
00:32:47,322 --> 00:32:50,654
either chopped up Romero and the bodies
on San Marcos or they know who did it.

582
00:32:50,826 --> 00:32:53,454
High-end rentals all have lojacks
on them. We're on our way there now.

583
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,612
Vic?

584
00:32:55,347 --> 00:32:58,539
- Salvadorans are on board.
- Let's see where the mexicans are at.

585
00:33:02,982 --> 00:33:05,469
We'll settle our part of the deal
when we're alone.

586
00:33:07,284 --> 00:33:09,224
Byz Lats want to do the right thing.

587
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:12,150
I can give you 3 shooters.

588
00:33:13,347 --> 00:33:17,336
- We have witnesses who saw 6.
- I'm saying there was only 3.

589
00:33:17,555 --> 00:33:19,526
And you stop looking for any others.

590
00:33:26,681 --> 00:33:27,854
We're not gonna do any better.

591
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,873
- 3 murderers walk free?
- And 3 don't.

592
00:33:30,029 --> 00:33:33,268
It closes this case.
It gives us a break from more bloodshed.

593
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:39,083
Ok.

594
00:33:41,101 --> 00:33:42,197
Bring'em in.

595
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:45,091
The others will find their way
into our net eventually.

596
00:33:51,005 --> 00:33:53,524
The place you tracked me down,
put the gun to my head.

597
00:33:53,727 --> 00:33:57,529
Lose the salvadorans there.
We'll teach them how to use a machete.

598
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:05,523
You want to get some backup on this?
I mean, what if Santi's setting us up?

599
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,887
- His 3 shooters could be 10.
- Nah, nah. This is a straight-up deal.

600
00:34:09,106 --> 00:34:11,609
He wants us off the scent of whatever
the Byz Lats have brewing.

601
00:34:11,765 --> 00:34:13,706
Giving up these idiots is a bargain.

602
00:34:26,052 --> 00:34:27,679
You're not gonna believe this.

603
00:34:33,284 --> 00:34:34,536
What? What is it?

604
00:34:39,826 --> 00:34:42,517
Spin them this way. We'll go
in the side door. Let's go.

605
00:34:51,043 --> 00:34:52,686
- Show me your hands!
- Police!

606
00:34:52,795 --> 00:34:54,782
Get against the wall right now!
Against the wall!

607
00:34:54,938 --> 00:34:57,569
- Get down!
- Show me your hands! On your head!

608
00:34:59,103 --> 00:35:00,417
Don't you move!

609
00:35:00,777 --> 00:35:01,919
All aboard.

610
00:35:04,537 --> 00:35:06,539
Black mercedes is in the garage.

611
00:35:08,628 --> 00:35:09,442
Ready?

612
00:35:11,139 --> 00:35:14,829
Don't move! Hands on your head!
Hands on your head!

613
00:35:15,966 --> 00:35:17,217
Turn around.

614
00:35:20,479 --> 00:35:21,888
Eduardo Romero?

615
00:35:22,951 --> 00:35:23,749
Si.

616
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:26,894
I'm glad we found the rest of you.

617
00:35:28,146 --> 00:35:30,931
- It's ok. We're the police.
- Fine. Leave.

618
00:35:31,173 --> 00:35:33,348
Uh, we need to ask you
a few questions first.

619
00:35:33,489 --> 00:35:35,147
Like what happened to the
other half of your arm?

620
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:38,432
I'm a mexican official.
Diplomatic immunity.

621
00:35:38,652 --> 00:35:41,608
- And I told you to leave.
- We need to get you to a hospital.

622
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:44,933
Dutch.

623
00:35:49,392 --> 00:35:51,223
You ever hear of traveler's checks?

624
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,501
The consulate office is furious.

625
00:35:55,657 --> 00:35:58,238
Claim Romero explicitly told you
not to bring him down here.

626
00:35:58,395 --> 00:36:00,468
Brought him in for his own good.
Protective custody.

627
00:36:00,578 --> 00:36:04,067
They chopped the guy's arm off.
Diplomatic immunity, Dutch.

628
00:36:04,254 --> 00:36:07,070
- International protocol.
- This guy lost his arm at

629
00:36:07,258 --> 00:36:10,152
a grisly crime scene. He had a suitcase
full of unexplained cash.

630
00:36:10,309 --> 00:36:13,062
He was present at the
San Marcos murders.

631
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:15,018
Mexican consulate's gonna
be here in 5 minutes.

632
00:36:15,127 --> 00:36:18,335
We're never gonna see this guy again.
How we supposed to stop that?

633
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:22,293
Romero held onto that cash
like it was his missing hand.

634
00:36:22,497 --> 00:36:24,453
Going home without it is not an option.

635
00:36:24,585 --> 00:36:29,216
We want him to stick around, we make
sure his $230,000 luggage gets lost.

636
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:32,118
That amount of money is booked.

637
00:36:32,243 --> 00:36:35,278
Technically, we should
notify and send to narcotics.

638
00:36:35,451 --> 00:36:38,314
35% of bills test positive
for drug residue...

639
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,316
A lot of bills, a lot of testing.

640
00:36:40,434 --> 00:36:42,421
Could be tied up in the system a while.

641
00:36:42,874 --> 00:36:46,504
I'll expect a lot of angry calls
from diplomats... Mexican and our own.

642
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:49,367
But maybe Romero hangs around
L.A. long enough for us to get into him

643
00:36:49,508 --> 00:36:50,759
and crack this case.

644
00:36:55,054 --> 00:36:56,759
Get that suitcase out of here

645
00:36:56,916 --> 00:36:59,465
before his "get out of the country free"
card shows up.

646
00:37:02,517 --> 00:37:05,082
Open it.
Your bail came through.

647
00:37:06,663 --> 00:37:07,617
Let's go.

648
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:14,407
These are the shotgun mexis
broke up your little street fair today.

649
00:37:14,563 --> 00:37:17,301
Too bad you can't hang around for a
little while and get better acquainted.

650
00:37:19,554 --> 00:37:20,735
Get out.

651
00:37:22,636 --> 00:37:23,497
Get out.

652
00:37:33,177 --> 00:37:35,759
Ok, we kept our end of the deal,
delivered the shooters.

653
00:37:35,884 --> 00:37:38,340
- Let's hope Hernan can keep his.
- He will.

654
00:37:38,919 --> 00:37:41,125
We stopped the blood...
For now.

655
00:37:49,155 --> 00:37:51,690
- Thanks again for the toys.
- You're welcome.

656
00:37:53,434 --> 00:37:55,609
I'm sorry if I said too much earlier.

657
00:37:55,781 --> 00:37:57,236
- I got a lot on my mind...
- Listen, it's

658
00:37:57,393 --> 00:37:59,771
no problem.
I've been there myself, so...

659
00:38:02,828 --> 00:38:05,047
Some thing happened between
Vic and Shane,

660
00:38:05,147 --> 00:38:07,397
some kind of rift, and it's pretty bad.

661
00:38:07,631 --> 00:38:09,493
I don't get involved in Vic's business.

662
00:38:09,822 --> 00:38:11,715
Well, I get involved with Shane's.

663
00:38:11,966 --> 00:38:14,203
We're still married, and I'm
worried about him.

664
00:38:14,391 --> 00:38:16,706
Maybe you should talk to
your children's father.

665
00:38:16,847 --> 00:38:19,131
What, you think Vic's gonna
do something to him?

666
00:38:20,375 --> 00:38:21,940
Tell Vic we don't want any trouble.

667
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:23,583
He can get hurt, too.

668
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:24,709
What?

669
00:38:24,897 --> 00:38:27,901
He has just as much to lose
as we do, if not more.

670
00:38:28,104 --> 00:38:32,578
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Just tell him, ok?

671
00:38:41,684 --> 00:38:42,638
Hey.

672
00:38:43,811 --> 00:38:45,345
Number one? How much?

673
00:38:45,571 --> 00:38:46,729
All of it.

674
00:38:46,933 --> 00:38:50,140
- I need to see your supply invoices.
- My gasoline is legal, man.

675
00:38:50,312 --> 00:38:53,488
- I'm the one with a badge, Abdul.
- I'll decide whether it's legal or not.

676
00:38:53,738 --> 00:38:57,117
Well, you can't just order me to
show information. You need a warrant.

677
00:38:57,516 --> 00:38:59,355
You might want to have a
better look at that badge.

678
00:38:59,487 --> 00:39:01,701
That gives me the
right to your receipts.

679
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:06,184
- I'm a citizen, man.
- Yeah.

680
00:39:06,387 --> 00:39:07,827
Not in my world.

681
00:39:18,286 --> 00:39:19,945
You can't... Aagh!

682
00:39:21,814 --> 00:39:24,677
I see here you got a shipment
coming tonight from Nawzad oil.

683
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,710
Maybe they're on the
homeland security watch.

684
00:39:26,929 --> 00:39:28,791
You're gonna refuse that shipment.

685
00:39:28,916 --> 00:39:30,982
That's bullshit, man.
I need the gasoline.

686
00:39:31,115 --> 00:39:34,463
Don't worry. Another supplier will be
here tomorrow to fill up all your tanks.

687
00:39:34,603 --> 00:39:35,886
What supplier?

688
00:39:36,074 --> 00:39:39,422
I'm not sure, but I'm
guessing it ends in "i-a-n".

689
00:39:39,696 --> 00:39:42,981
The armenians? They put you up to this?
Aagh!

690
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,023
Nobody puts me up to anything.

691
00:39:45,868 --> 00:39:49,153
I'm just a guy looking out for
the best interests of his country.

692
00:39:51,852 --> 00:39:54,528
I'll be back tonight
to check on your patriotism.

693
00:40:09,738 --> 00:40:10,911
Where's Hernan?

694
00:40:11,635 --> 00:40:13,779
He called me. He's 20 minutes late.

695
00:40:14,013 --> 00:40:17,002
- I know. We lost contact with him.
- What's that mean?

696
00:40:17,393 --> 00:40:19,474
Any way you guys could have
compromised his cover?

697
00:40:19,623 --> 00:40:24,160
No... No. You saw our operation.
It was strictly on a need-to-know basis.

698
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,210
Shit.

699
00:40:44,787 --> 00:40:47,666
Claudette Wyms.
Captain at the Barn.

700
00:40:49,309 --> 00:40:54,472
I uh... Found this buried under the
paperwork when I moved into my office.

701
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:57,428
It was taken from Ben when he
was being processed.

702
00:40:57,569 --> 00:40:59,462
Never made its way back to you.

703
00:41:02,795 --> 00:41:06,378
And you thought now would be
the right time to return them?

704
00:41:07,724 --> 00:41:08,584
No.

705
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:13,496
You seemed upset at the Barn today.
Wondering if I could help.

706
00:41:15,201 --> 00:41:18,049
It's nothing.
It's taken care of.

707
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:22,429
I have two girls.

708
00:41:22,821 --> 00:41:25,308
A little older...
Same age difference.

709
00:41:25,457 --> 00:41:28,195
Can't find a picture of my
ex anywhere either.

710
00:41:28,445 --> 00:41:30,479
Guess we know how to pick 'em, right?

711
00:41:31,762 --> 00:41:33,514
Mine had his demons.

712
00:41:33,764 --> 00:41:34,969
He was shot in the head

713
00:41:35,094 --> 00:41:38,020
in the front seat of the car
with my oldest sitting next to him.

714
00:41:38,818 --> 00:41:40,617
How they dealing with that?

715
00:41:41,931 --> 00:41:46,374
I don't know. Seem ok. Never know
what's going on in their heads.

716
00:41:47,955 --> 00:41:50,004
Yeah, they don't tell you anything.

717
00:41:50,411 --> 00:41:53,650
Well, after a while, you stop asking.
Good night.

718
00:41:55,644 --> 00:41:57,615
You ever blame yourself?

719
00:41:58,476 --> 00:42:00,322
Putting them through all that shit?

720
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,686
Not any more.

721
00:42:05,298 --> 00:42:06,581
Good for you.

722
00:42:07,651 --> 00:42:09,701
You need my help, you call me.

723
00:42:12,016 --> 00:42:13,737
A few weeks ago...

724
00:42:14,293 --> 00:42:18,815
Vic wanted to know how Ben got
ahold of... cash down in Mexico.

725
00:42:19,612 --> 00:42:21,897
You wired him the money when
he was on the run?

726
00:42:22,546 --> 00:42:26,066
That would be aiding and abetting.
Tough choice for a wife and mother.

727
00:42:28,444 --> 00:42:31,432
Vendrell came by today.
He wanted the same information.

728
00:42:31,714 --> 00:42:33,075
He was all jacked up.

729
00:42:33,341 --> 00:42:37,503
- I just don't want Vic and his guys...
- I won't let them hurt you in this.

730
00:42:44,332 --> 00:42:48,087
One-tango-13.
I have a white male, possible D.B.

731
00:42:48,283 --> 00:42:50,551
- Requesting an R.A. Unit.
- Jesus!

732
00:42:50,974 --> 00:42:53,524
Thinking premium or regular unleaded?

733
00:43:08,008 --> 00:43:10,010
Don't come to this house again.

734
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:13,844
Keeping the widow warm
since the old man's been gone?

735
00:43:14,003 --> 00:43:15,646
You've destroyed enough families.

736
00:43:16,115 --> 00:43:17,774
You leave hers alone.

737
00:43:21,247 --> 00:43:22,342
Don't worry.

738
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:25,236
It's not like it's a live
grenade or anything.

739
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:29,038
It's Gilroy's mexican information.

740
00:43:29,554 --> 00:43:31,337
Good luck on the goat farm.

741
00:43:31,729 --> 00:43:34,732
I hear the Juarez P.D. is
looking for a few good hombres.

742
00:43:34,951 --> 00:43:38,643
Think if I was gonna run,
I'd set up the same deal we had for Lem?

743
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:42,532
The one you knew all the details to?
Come on, Vic.

744
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:44,738
You taught me better than that.

745
00:43:45,222 --> 00:43:48,273
I knew if I cranked up Nancy's motor,
it would get you here...

746
00:43:48,649 --> 00:43:50,557
On neutral ground...

747
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:54,141
So that I cold give you this.

748
00:43:56,988 --> 00:44:00,555
- What is it?
- The original is in a warm, safe place.

749
00:44:01,939 --> 00:44:03,629
Now, anything happens to me

750
00:44:03,863 --> 00:44:06,429
or my wife or my son...

751
00:44:06,883 --> 00:44:08,979
Even my mailman, anybody...

752
00:44:09,292 --> 00:44:10,732
that I am close to,

753
00:44:11,584 --> 00:44:14,166
that lands on I.A.D.'s doorstep.

754
00:44:15,136 --> 00:44:17,561
Just imagine every wrong,

755
00:44:17,717 --> 00:44:20,502
brutal thing we have ever done.

756
00:44:21,636 --> 00:44:23,326
It's hard to do, isn't it?

757
00:44:23,592 --> 00:44:25,172
We've done so many.

758
