1
00:00:00,934 --> 00:00:02,268
<i>Previously on "The Shield".</i>

2
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:05,071
They killed these Armenians
looking for our money-train cash.

3
00:00:05,138 --> 00:00:07,374
There's four people
who know we took that money.

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,575
They're all sitting right here.

5
00:00:08,641 --> 00:00:10,710
My office instituted a sting operation.

6
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:12,112
What kind of sting operation?

7
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:14,948
In San Jose, the Armenians were extorting
a local businessman.

8
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:18,018
He allowed us to insert $50,000
of marked, traceable bills

9
00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:19,619
into his payment to the Armenians so,

10
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:22,522
any of these marked bills show up,
they might lead you to your killers.

11
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:27,160
Hey. I'm getting the feeling you're not
appreciating the promotion I gave you.

12
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:30,296
It doesn't matter to what I agree.
Garza calls the shots.

13
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:32,565
I just need proof
he ordered the hit on this Calva guy

14
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:35,935
and the throne
and the crown are all yours.

15
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:38,538
Put this with the rest
of the Money Train stash.

16
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:41,441
It's 20 grand light.
Byz Lats' overhead, I guess.

17
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:43,910
- Better than losing the whole hundred.
- The way I figure it.

18
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:47,747
Victim's name is lsabel Nelson,
raped by a lone male.

19
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:50,150
Guy was waiting in the house naked
when she came home.

20
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:51,618
Isabel's 73.

21
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:53,687
I need you to work it out with Shane.

22
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,623
- Tell him.
- I'm gonna talk to him too.

23
00:00:57,357 --> 00:01:00,427
But I'm asking you,
take one for the team here.

24
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:02,429
He's been my best friend for seven years.

25
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:04,964
You really think he's gonna push me aside
for some darkie?

26
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:12,405
Get off!

27
00:01:33,893 --> 00:01:35,095
Here she is.

28
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:37,764
<i>What's going on?</i>
<i>Jesus, no one's telling us anything.</i>

29
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:42,035
I talked to Dr. Thiel
and Tavon's condition is grave...

30
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,536
traumatic brain damage.

31
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,305
<i>He's got a tough road.</i>

32
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:47,107
Can we see him?

33
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:49,409
<i>He's in ICU. It's family only.</i>

34
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,544
He's on my team.

35
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,515
If he takes a turn either way,
I'll let you know.

36
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,166
- Yeah.
<i>- Did you get my messages?</i>

37
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,070
No. What's going on?

38
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,105
<i>Tavon got into an accident, man.</i>

39
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:21,941
<i>Hit a parked car full speed.</i>

40
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:23,710
<i>He might not make it.</i>

41
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:25,545
Man.

42
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:28,948
Listen, we're at Mission Cross.
You gotta get down here.

43
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:30,150
Yeah. I...

44
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:33,153
I kind of had a rough night myself.

45
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:36,389
I mixed it up with this guy
at the Three of Clubs.

46
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:39,459
I gotta take this other call.

47
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:42,062
- lf you can make it, you should come.
<i>- Okay.</i>

48
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,503
We gotta clean this up.

49
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:59,779
- Hello?
- I called you.

50
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,448
What's the problem, ma'am?

51
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:05,085
I think my ex-boyfriend's in the house.

52
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:08,321
Lyle Dockman. He's been harassing me.

53
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:12,092
My bedroom light was off
when I went to work.

54
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:14,094
Did you get a restraining order
out on him?

55
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:16,262
Yes. It just made him madder.

56
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:19,966
All right, we'll check it out.

57
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:21,468
Police.

58
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:25,372
Anyone in the house?

59
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:28,742
I'll check the upstairs.

60
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,115
Ma'am, stay back, please.

61
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,488
<i>Bedroom's clear.</i>

62
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:43,757
My God.

63
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:44,924
Danielle!

64
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:49,029
Halt! Police!

65
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:50,030
Halt!

66
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:55,935
You okay?

67
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:57,971
Yeah.

68
00:03:58,672 --> 00:03:59,773
Is he gone?

69
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:01,975
Yeah.

70
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,117
I'm here. What?

71
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:13,753
Sorry about Tavon.

72
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:15,622
What do you want?

73
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:17,590
I need you to sweep the Alvarado Corridor.

74
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:19,826
- Looking for?
- Cruisers, loiterers.

75
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:22,395
There have been complaints
from business owners and citizens.

76
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:27,500
You want me for something real,
I'll be at the hospital.

77
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:30,837
The doctors said they won't know anything
for a couple of days.

78
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:34,074
I'm sorry it happened
but there's still work to do.

79
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,942
I'm a detective not a janitor.

80
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:40,213
- Get your units to do your sweeping.
- I'm giving you the broom.

81
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,548
Strike Team is a special unit.

82
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:45,018
All you've done since your promotion
is jam us up with bullshit gigs.

83
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:47,887
Maybe with Gilroy
you could pick your special cases,

84
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:51,191
but now it goes:
Chief Bankston to Aceveda to me to you.

85
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:54,494
You don't like that pecking order,
take it up the ladder.

86
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:56,229
See who is out of a job.

87
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:01,801
Alvarado Corridor?

88
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,970
Till I tell you otherwise.

89
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,027
You all right?

90
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:28,995
Bulb blew out.

91
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:35,769
THE SHIELD

92
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:46,479
<i>- Shane!</i>
- I got it.

93
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:47,581
Hang on.

94
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:50,050
Coming.

95
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,858
- Sorry, I was on my way...
- Forget it.

96
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,493
Wyms has us on a shit sweep.

97
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,595
Alvarado.

98
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:03,863
Jesus. Someone clocked you.

99
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,967
- Dude, who kicked your ass?
- It was this guy...

100
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,936
This drunk asshole
was pawing me in the bar and,

101
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:11,605
Shane told him to get lost

102
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:13,873
and him and his friends
jumped him in the bathroom.

103
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:15,709
There was more than one guy?

104
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,811
No, it was mainly one guy.

105
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,113
I mean, the other guys
just stood there and watched.

106
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:22,515
How is Tavon doing?

107
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,453
Did he come by here tonight?

108
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:28,288
Tavon? No, why would he?

109
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:30,390
He said he was gonna mend fences.

110
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:32,626
It's just us.

111
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:34,394
Laundry night.

112
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:36,496
Everything else all right?

113
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:38,531
Yeah. I'm good.

114
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:40,700
I'm taking care of him.

115
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:42,869
Stay home.

116
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:45,839
I don't want you showing up at work
looking like you got bitchslapped.

117
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,618
<i>Fiesta siesta.</i>

118
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:00,820
Anybody still here in a minute
gets run in.

119
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:02,455
You heard the man. Let's pack it up

120
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:03,657
- party people!
- Come on.

121
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,928
Thought this was a free country.

122
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:10,030
Got a curfew in this part of town, homes.

123
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,598
Not for me. I'm over 21.

124
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:13,233
What do you think?

125
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,902
About 14 coats of high-end enamel?

126
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:17,003
Let's see.

127
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:19,873
Yo, man. I'm gone, man.

128
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:26,546
- Where were you tonight around 10:00?
- Jogging.

129
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,582
I do three miles every night after work.

130
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:32,018
You weren't doing a 100-yard dash
through your ex-girlfriend's backyard?

131
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:34,955
Elena? I can't go within 1000 feet of her.

132
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:38,124
Or call her, but you've been
leaving messages on her machine.

133
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:41,461
Before the restraining order.
It's a crime to want another chance?

134
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:44,030
- She's not giving you another chance.
- Not yet.

135
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:47,467
- Not ever.
- Someone was in her house tonight.

136
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:49,102
- Is she okay?
- She's fine.

137
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:51,871
Can anyone verify
you were jogging tonight?

138
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:55,041
You'd have to ask around.

139
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:58,912
Okay, well, we're watching over Elena.

140
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,115
And now we're watching you.

141
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:04,584
<i>Problema, amigo?</i>

142
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:09,356
This is your 10th citation
for cruising in the last four months.

143
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:10,490
I juice up cars.

144
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:13,226
Humming out here with my baby's
the only advertisement I got.

145
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:16,429
Try the Yellow Pages,
because we're bringing the car in.

146
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:19,599
- When do I get it back?
- About a month or two.

147
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:23,203
- After you see a judge, pay a fine.
- Well, take care of her till then.

148
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:27,340
Every cent I made the last five years
I got wrapped up on her.

149
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:31,144
Really? I would have pegged you
as more of a mutual-fund guy.

150
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:34,080
What do I gotta do to keep my wheels?

151
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:37,851
Flip me someone juicier than you.

152
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:42,522
Here's her ride.

153
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:46,626
Wait. This vato, Aramis.

154
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,995
I call her twice a month.
I remember her birthday.

155
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:51,598
- Her only son.
- So you're taking her?

156
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:54,267
Seen Claudette?

157
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:58,038
She and Dutch just caught one.
Another possible elderly rape victim.

158
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:00,740
What do you need?

159
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:04,811
She's got me working
the Alvarado Corridor next few days.

160
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,046
Right. Sweeping duty.

161
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,114
Last night, I'm tagging this guy.

162
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:10,784
We're about to tow away his Hot Wheels,

163
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:15,055
he spills about a guy sneaking contraband
into Chino Prison for his gang buddies.

164
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:16,289
What kind of contraband?

165
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:20,627
Drugs, cigs, xxxx rings,
weapons of mass destruction, who knows?

166
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:22,028
You checking into it?

167
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:24,864
I was looking for Claudette to see
if I should stick with cruiser duty.

168
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:26,499
Follow up on this for the time being.

169
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:28,535
Wherever you want me.

170
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:36,576
- Gentlemen, what do we got?
- B&E, robbery.

171
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,879
Fits your rapist profile, though.
Elderly woman, living alone.

172
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:42,449
- You read my memos?
- Watch C.O. makes us.

173
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:45,151
- Did the victim call it in?
- No, I didn't.

174
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:46,152
I did.

175
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:48,488
Detective Wyms and Wagenbach.

176
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,424
Patty Klopp. My mother, Luann.

177
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:53,994
They broke in last night.

178
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,930
I stopped by this morning
and noticed some Hummels were gone.

179
00:09:56,997 --> 00:09:59,299
Couple of tchotchkes. So what?

180
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:01,534
Someone broke into your home, Ma.

181
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,870
- You have to report that.
- And now you have.

182
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:07,374
She's supposed to be watching
her sugar levels.

183
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:16,116
Anything taken from the bedroom?

184
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:17,817
Not that I know of.

185
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:19,319
When did the robbery occur?

186
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:21,922
Last night.

187
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:23,056
Came home around...

188
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,625
9:00 from the movies.

189
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:26,893
You see anybody?

190
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,296
Just saw my things missing.

191
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:30,630
You weren't afraid?

192
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,900
I've lived in this neighborhood
for 40 years.

193
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:36,970
Your daughter says she's trying
to get you to Encino.

194
00:10:37,037 --> 00:10:39,639
You'll have to kill me
before I retire to the valley.

195
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,913
You got something special in mind
for the ride back?

196
00:10:47,414 --> 00:10:48,415
Funny.

197
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:51,618
The compulsive eating, the odd,
distracted behavior.

198
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:53,019
I think Luann was raped.

199
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:58,558
Well, yeah, she's a tough, old broad,
but I saw it too.

200
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:01,127
You are agreeing with me?

201
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:04,698
I'm agreeing that she loses her dignity
if she admits she was attacked.

202
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:08,101
Her dignity and her independence.
Speaking of losing your dignity...

203
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:12,138
The bed was stripped.
There was nothing in the clothes hamper.

204
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:16,409
Whatever you find in there
is gonna be too contaminated to test.

205
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:17,611
It's too bad.

206
00:11:19,246 --> 00:11:21,815
Why do you throw out
a perfectly good set of sheets?

207
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,517
To bury the truth.

208
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:28,688
Wonder how many other buried sheets there
are out there.

209
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:35,195
Here's Aramis.

210
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:37,464
Byz Lats are showing initiative.

211
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:40,567
Diagur's running them better
than I thought.

212
00:11:40,634 --> 00:11:42,168
Yo, Ronnie, you see him?

213
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,338
Guy with the cigarettes? Yeah, I got him.

214
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:49,709
That's good.

215
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:53,480
Either this guy
is sneaking shit into Chino

216
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,882
or he needs the world's largest patch.

217
00:11:57,317 --> 00:11:58,818
Let's see where he takes us.

218
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:02,389
We can't provide 24-hour protection
to every woman with an ex with a temper.

219
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:04,991
Sir, I did some checking up
on this bastard.

220
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,127
The last ex who got
a restraining order on him,

221
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:09,829
left a good job in Cleveland
to move to New Hampshire

222
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,464
just to disappear from this guy.

223
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,733
She was sure that he would kill her.

224
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,202
This one feels real to me, sir.

225
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:18,004
Look, Danny's right.

226
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,239
This one feels real.

227
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:24,978
Okay, we can escort her to and from work.
Extra patrols.

228
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:27,914
You got one week for the guy to violate
the order before I pull the plug.

229
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:31,751
- All right. Thank you, sir.
- Don't thank me.

230
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:33,253
She should be thanking you.

231
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:38,124
I got 29 B & E's of elderly women.
Eleven in the last six months.

232
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:42,162
Called the hospitals, they'll give us
a heads up if anyone fits that profile.

233
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:44,764
What about your new promotion?

234
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:46,866
You sure you got time
to help me on this one?

235
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:49,336
For this? Yeah, I'm all yours.

236
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:51,638
Yeah? Ever hear of this guy?

237
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:57,177
This "Mueller's Geographical Profiles"?

238
00:12:57,244 --> 00:13:00,580
That's the criminologist from Duke?

239
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:02,415
Doctor of Criminal Logistics.

240
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:06,553
Takes data on serial violent crimes,
victims, nature of the assault...

241
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:10,624
Generates the most likely location
of where the perpetrator lives or works.

242
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,693
Needs three confirmed cases
to work up a preliminary profile.

243
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,664
- We've only got one victim confirmed.
- Two if Luann comes clean.

244
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:21,701
You think Aceveda will spring for it?
It's expensive.

245
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:25,939
No. Let's find numbers two and three.
Then we'll stick him with the bill.

246
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:30,977
You already made arrests?

247
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:33,847
Caught them exchanging packages
of smokes and drugs,

248
00:13:33,914 --> 00:13:35,749
along with 7,500 in cash.

249
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,251
Guess that's the smuggling rate
these days.

250
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:41,655
- Good work.
- Banger puts together care packages.

251
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:43,757
The white guy
is a frozen-food delivery man

252
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,492
who drops off at Chino twice a week.

253
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:46,927
What are you working on exactly?

254
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:49,729
I got a tip from a cruiser last night

255
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:52,799
about a guy sneaking swag
into the state pen.

256
00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:56,069
Shouldn't be hard to get Joe Trucker
to roll on cholo and vice versa.

257
00:13:58,405 --> 00:14:01,408
- You moved off the Alvarado Corridor?
- Yeah.

258
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:03,777
Couldn't find you,
so I moved up the ladder.

259
00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:08,315
So I had some cigarettes.

260
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:10,550
We're not talking about
a couple cartons of Marlboros.

261
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:13,653
We nabbed you handing off
20 thumbs of heroin too.

262
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,323
Must be the old man's.
I learned in school to just say no.

263
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:19,726
You take the orders, gather the shit,
hand them off to Fred

264
00:14:19,793 --> 00:14:21,962
who sneaks it in with the frozen peas.
Am I right?

265
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:25,298
- We got you dead on rights, man.
- On all your wrongs.

266
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:26,199
Look.

267
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:28,702
I spoke to the DA.

268
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:34,574
If you cooperate, I can make sure
that you do your time at Chino again

269
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:37,077
- with all your fellow banditos.
- Else, who knows,

270
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:39,479
maybe you end up
someplace chilly like Shasta.

271
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:48,989
Can I go home now?

272
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:53,226
Sorry. It's gonna be a little while.

273
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:55,028
What's the problem?

274
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:57,731
We just talked to Aramis.
He told us the whole thing.

275
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:01,468
The twice a week drop-offs you make
at Chino State Correctional Facility.

276
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:03,303
I'm a delivery man. That's my job.

277
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,839
There was heroin
in this week's care package.

278
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:09,442
I don't look at what's in the packages.

279
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:12,212
But you knew it was wrong.

280
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:19,786
I should go home now.

281
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:24,224
- My wife is making dinner.
- Easy. It's all right.

282
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:26,826
Fred.

283
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,361
Fred.

284
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:30,730
You're under arrest. You understand that?

285
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:33,667
No. That's not right.

286
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:39,539
If you can confirm
who receives this stuff on the inside

287
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,741
maybe we can make things
a little easier on you.

288
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:44,644
No. This is a mistake.

289
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:46,746
This can't happen.

290
00:15:47,347 --> 00:15:48,848
I'm not a criminal.

291
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:58,258
The Strike Team just made a bust
that included $7,500 in cash.

292
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:02,395
I need you to run the serial numbers
of the bills against these numbers.

293
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:04,631
Again with this?

294
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:08,268
Let me know if you get any matches
and then return that list straight to me.

295
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,571
Why do you have me doing
such menial things for you?

296
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:16,142
- Because you're my assistant.
- I could be so much more to you.

297
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:19,779
With the election and everything.

298
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:22,449
I have a campaign staff for that.

299
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,684
They don't know what they are doing.

300
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:27,887
You've no idea the mistakes I fix
before they land on your desk.

301
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:30,023
And I appreciate it, but for now, please.

302
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:32,459
Just check the numbers on that list
against the money in evidence.

303
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,172
- You okay?
- It's Layla.

304
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,675
She reported a robbery five months ago

305
00:16:48,742 --> 00:16:53,013
and after a lot of handholding,
just admitted she was raped.

306
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:57,017
- Jesus. This guy...
- She tell you anything that will help?

307
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,853
No condoms, no climax.

308
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:02,489
- A lot of cuddling.
- That makes two confirmed.

309
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:04,090
I struck out on my end.

310
00:17:04,157 --> 00:17:05,558
We need one more.

311
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:08,662
I don't remember anybody snooping around.

312
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:13,166
Delivery guy?
Anybody that seemed suspicious?

313
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:14,134
In this neighborhood?

314
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:17,037
Try to find someone
who doesn't look suspicious.

315
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:20,473
The reason we ask, Luann,
is because there is a man

316
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:24,511
who is breaking into homes
and sexually assaulting women.

317
00:17:24,578 --> 00:17:27,147
- Sexually?
- I'm flattered, detective.

318
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:29,849
He's targeting women your age.

319
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:32,619
- What are you talking about?
- Did someone hurt you?

320
00:17:34,254 --> 00:17:35,388
Of course not.

321
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:41,328
Thank God.

322
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:46,900
- I pulled Tavon's accident report.
- Thanks for doing that.

323
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:50,503
You know, witnesses saw
the car swerving a couple blocks

324
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,339
before he hit that parked car.

325
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:54,474
- Before?
- Yeah.

326
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,443
- Is Tavon a drinker?
- I don't think so.

327
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:58,578
Which direction was the car going in?

328
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:01,248
North on Perry.

329
00:18:02,015 --> 00:18:02,916
North?

330
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:05,452
Thanks.

331
00:18:08,989 --> 00:18:09,889
Hey.

332
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:11,825
I thought you don't want me coming in.

333
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,094
I thought you were gonna come alone.

334
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:16,796
She wasn't sure I was good to drive.

335
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:18,999
- Thoughtful.
- Yeah.

336
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:20,934
What's up?

337
00:18:24,871 --> 00:18:27,007
Tavon was headed away from your place.

338
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:30,777
Witnesses saw his car swerving all
over the road, before he hit the car.

339
00:18:30,844 --> 00:18:33,179
Toxi report shows no drugs or alcohol.

340
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,881
That's weird.

341
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:37,384
What do you think happened?

342
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:39,586
Don't know yet.

343
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,022
Don't have all the facts.

344
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:44,224
There's something missing.

345
00:18:44,858 --> 00:18:47,427
Like a coffee table or a painting.

346
00:18:52,532 --> 00:18:53,934
Look, he came over.

347
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:57,304
Gave me this backhanded apology.

348
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,672
We had some words.

349
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:00,440
He jumped me.

350
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:03,510
And I tagged him back
with a pretty good shot.

351
00:19:03,577 --> 00:19:04,978
How good and where?

352
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:07,948
- To the back of the head.
- The back of the...

353
00:19:08,949 --> 00:19:09,883
He has brain trauma.

354
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:12,552
It was from an accident
that happened miles away from my place.

355
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:15,288
He was swerving all over the road
before the crash.

356
00:19:15,789 --> 00:19:17,591
Your blow probably caused it.

357
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:19,593
You could face charges.

358
00:19:22,963 --> 00:19:25,432
- What did you hit him with?
- A paperweight or something.

359
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:26,833
Look, he was all over me.

360
00:19:27,701 --> 00:19:29,135
Where were you during all this?

361
00:19:30,136 --> 00:19:32,339
I was doing laundry in the basement.

362
00:19:32,906 --> 00:19:35,342
- Really? Whites or colors?
- She wasn't there.

363
00:19:36,543 --> 00:19:37,444
All right?

364
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:40,146
This thing was all me.

365
00:19:42,616 --> 00:19:44,918
- Hold on.
- Here's your list back.

366
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:47,487
- Thank you.
- Got two matches.

367
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:49,823
- What?
- Two of the bills.

368
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:52,626
Their serial numbers were on the list.
I wrote which ones down for you.

369
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:01,601
Where are you taking him?

370
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:03,503
Interrogation.

371
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:06,273
- I'll meet you upstairs.
- Sure thing.

372
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:09,142
We miss a piece of the puzzle
putting together Aramis?

373
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:12,612
No. We just need to talk to him
on an unrelated matter.

374
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:15,682
I'll let you guys get back
to the Alvarado Corridor.

375
00:20:15,749 --> 00:20:16,683
Thanks.

376
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:18,652
Who is the suit?

377
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,421
His lD said Treasury.

378
00:20:21,488 --> 00:20:23,857
That's the second T-fed in our house
in two weeks.

379
00:20:23,924 --> 00:20:25,625
What's Treasury want from our collar?

380
00:20:26,927 --> 00:20:29,095
Aramis is one of Diagur's <i>tenientes.</i>

381
00:20:30,163 --> 00:20:33,266
You think that Aceveda knows about
the corners we cut with Diagur

382
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,501
to get those guns back?

383
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:36,303
One way to find out.

384
00:20:43,543 --> 00:20:44,611
<i>Care about that.</i>

385
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:49,082
<i>Just tell us where you got the 7,500</i>
<i>in cash you gave to the delivery guy.</i>

386
00:20:49,149 --> 00:20:51,318
<i>I already made a deal with the other cop.</i>

387
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:53,086
<i>Ain't gotta rat on my boys.</i>

388
00:20:53,587 --> 00:20:56,323
Your crime is now
under federal investigation.

389
00:20:56,389 --> 00:20:57,557
That's why Agent Nell is here.

390
00:20:57,624 --> 00:21:00,293
Which means any previous deal,
got null and void.

391
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,495
Bullshit. My ticket's punched to Chino.

392
00:21:02,562 --> 00:21:03,930
It's punched wherever we say it is.

393
00:21:03,997 --> 00:21:07,334
Captain Aceveda has been checking money
confiscated in arrests.

394
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,201
<i>So?</i>

395
00:21:09,069 --> 00:21:11,972
Two of the bills you had
in your possession were marked.

396
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:16,276
They were stolen from
an Armenian money-laundering ring.

397
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:17,811
Holy shit.

398
00:21:17,877 --> 00:21:21,781
<i>We've been waiting for it to show up.</i>
<i>Guess what? It showed up in your hands.</i>

399
00:21:21,848 --> 00:21:23,950
- Our money is marked?
- No way.

400
00:21:24,017 --> 00:21:27,654
<i>- I don't know anything about...</i>
- Aramis said he got it from Diagur.

401
00:21:27,721 --> 00:21:30,523
We got our bag back from Diagur
20 grand light.

402
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:33,793
We are starting at square one Aramis.
Who did you get the money from?

403
00:21:35,428 --> 00:21:38,198
- I don't know where I got it from.
- Not good enough.

404
00:21:38,265 --> 00:21:40,800
Whoever stole that money
killed two Armenians to get it.

405
00:21:41,835 --> 00:21:44,237
We're gonna tie someone to these murders.

406
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:45,739
<i>You want it to be you...</i>

407
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,807
<i>or someone else?</i>

408
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:51,011
I really don't think
you want the death penalty

409
00:21:51,077 --> 00:21:52,345
for something you didn't do.

410
00:21:54,447 --> 00:21:55,649
Go!

411
00:22:06,626 --> 00:22:09,095
I got a sick feeling, man.
It's all crashing.

412
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:10,797
Not if we steer it in the right direction.

413
00:22:10,864 --> 00:22:12,232
Our money is marked?

414
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:14,434
Some of it? All of it?

415
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:16,236
- We don't know, man.
- Where are we going?

416
00:22:16,703 --> 00:22:18,672
Silence the smoking gun.

417
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:30,884
We're looking for Diagur.

418
00:22:32,152 --> 00:22:33,920
- Who are you faggots?
- Watch your mouth.

419
00:22:33,987 --> 00:22:37,424
We're the guys busting you
for possession of an illegal substance.

420
00:22:37,491 --> 00:22:39,526
- Where's Diagur?
- Who?

421
00:22:40,127 --> 00:22:42,229
Today's not the day.
I just need to talk to him.

422
00:22:42,295 --> 00:22:43,196
Where is he?

423
00:22:44,164 --> 00:22:46,900
Yeah. You give me a message,
I'll pass it on to him.

424
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:50,137
How long you been out of Terminal lsland?

425
00:22:51,605 --> 00:22:52,672
Not long enough.

426
00:22:54,341 --> 00:22:57,077
You don't tell me where your boss is at,
you gonna be jumping back.

427
00:22:57,711 --> 00:22:59,179
Home is where the heart is.

428
00:23:04,751 --> 00:23:06,987
Huff the pipe, asshole. Just take a hit.

429
00:23:07,521 --> 00:23:08,622
Take a hit.

430
00:23:12,426 --> 00:23:13,427
Take it.

431
00:23:15,195 --> 00:23:17,030
Take it! Goddamn it!

432
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:40,153
- Join the party, sweetheart. Come on.
- He's at Yolanda's.

433
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,288
One street over.

434
00:23:41,888 --> 00:23:43,023
Brown house with the Madonna.

435
00:24:00,173 --> 00:24:01,041
- Diagur?
- <i>Si.</i>

436
00:24:01,108 --> 00:24:03,076
- <i>Donde?</i>
- <i>En el cuarto.</i>

437
00:24:09,616 --> 00:24:11,118
- Jesus Christ.
- Get out!

438
00:24:11,718 --> 00:24:13,453
It's okay. Okay, I know him.

439
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,689
- How old are you?
- Old enough.

440
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:19,126
Glad Mom has such a firm grasp on things.

441
00:24:19,192 --> 00:24:20,193
Wait outside.

442
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,728
- Let's go.
- I need my clothes.

443
00:24:21,795 --> 00:24:23,196
What you doing breaking my freak, yo?

444
00:24:23,764 --> 00:24:26,333
You got a Byz Lats lawyer
on your speed dial?

445
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,101
- One of my boys has an uncle.
- Call him.

446
00:24:28,168 --> 00:24:30,771
Get him down
to the Farmington station house now.

447
00:24:30,837 --> 00:24:33,907
- What's there?
- Your prison delivery boy, Aramis.

448
00:24:33,974 --> 00:24:35,876
If he's doing things,
it's without me knowing.

449
00:24:35,942 --> 00:24:37,677
I'm all over your Chino game.

450
00:24:37,744 --> 00:24:39,913
Unless you want my boss all over you,

451
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,916
you get your lawyer down there
and make sure he zips it.

452
00:24:43,417 --> 00:24:44,251
Now.

453
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:47,587
Someone left a rose
in Elena's mailbox this afternoon.

454
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:49,523
Don't you have
more important things to do?

455
00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:52,259
Actually, unlawful use of a mailbox
is a federal offense.

456
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:55,328
We got done talking to your boss.
Technically, you were on the clock.

457
00:24:55,829 --> 00:24:57,264
Supposed to be making business calls.

458
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:58,565
You got proof it was me?

459
00:24:58,632 --> 00:25:01,201
For future proof, your boss
has agreed to monitor all your calls

460
00:25:01,268 --> 00:25:02,903
and your online activity here at work.

461
00:25:03,603 --> 00:25:06,473
- You can't do that.
- No. But she can.

462
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:09,576
You can either spend your 9 to 5 stalking

463
00:25:09,643 --> 00:25:12,679
or you can spend it working.
You can't do both.

464
00:25:12,746 --> 00:25:13,847
Listen, lady.

465
00:25:14,548 --> 00:25:15,782
This is my job.

466
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:18,385
Not for long
if you don't leave Elena alone.

467
00:25:20,353 --> 00:25:21,588
Have a nice day.

468
00:25:24,157 --> 00:25:25,025
I'll talk to you later.

469
00:25:26,226 --> 00:25:27,728
- Lawyer is on his way.
- Good.

470
00:25:28,462 --> 00:25:30,097
You know, you said before,
you didn't have my back.

471
00:25:30,163 --> 00:25:31,331
Why you helping me now?

472
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:35,168
Feds are buzzing around the money
you gave to Aramis.

473
00:25:35,235 --> 00:25:36,503
It's tied to a robbery.

474
00:25:37,437 --> 00:25:39,606
Somebody ripped off the Armenian mob.

475
00:25:39,673 --> 00:25:42,008
Well, man, I ain't suicidal.

476
00:25:42,843 --> 00:25:45,445
The Armenians find out
that you guys are suspects

477
00:25:45,512 --> 00:25:47,781
the Byz Lats will be in up to their necks
and severed feet.

478
00:25:47,848 --> 00:25:50,984
I'm just trying to prevent a war.
Where did you get the cash?

479
00:25:51,618 --> 00:25:53,687
Who knows? It comes in a dozen ways.

480
00:25:53,754 --> 00:25:55,689
Anybody asks, that's your best answer.

481
00:25:55,756 --> 00:25:58,158
You give Aramis anything
besides the 7,500?

482
00:25:58,225 --> 00:25:59,025
Yeah.

483
00:26:01,128 --> 00:26:03,830
- Fifteen grand.
- You handed it to him personally?

484
00:26:03,897 --> 00:26:07,334
- Think I trust some flunky with it?
- Your fingerprints could be on it.

485
00:26:07,401 --> 00:26:10,737
- Any idea where he stashed it?
- Yeah. In his freezer.

486
00:26:10,804 --> 00:26:12,506
- My idea.
- Original.

487
00:26:13,073 --> 00:26:15,008
Get somebody down to his place
to pick it up.

488
00:26:15,075 --> 00:26:17,010
You disappear for a couple of weeks.

489
00:26:21,281 --> 00:26:22,082
Shit.

490
00:26:22,716 --> 00:26:24,651
- He's back in the cage.
- He talked.

491
00:26:25,652 --> 00:26:26,953
He goddamn talked.

492
00:26:32,125 --> 00:26:32,993
Sarge.

493
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,535
Cold hard cash.

494
00:26:43,804 --> 00:26:45,906
I'll run the serial numbers
against the master list.

495
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:50,444
I get this to the lab before 5:00
I can get fingerprint results by morning.

496
00:26:52,012 --> 00:26:52,913
You coming?

497
00:26:54,114 --> 00:26:56,049
He gave us permission to search his place.

498
00:26:57,417 --> 00:26:59,052
I'm curious what else we might find here.

499
00:27:00,187 --> 00:27:01,588
I'll call some units for a ride.

500
00:27:02,389 --> 00:27:04,891
Diana Peabo.
She came into the ER last month.

501
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:06,927
Injuries sustained during a home robbery.

502
00:27:06,993 --> 00:27:10,263
Her kids just brought her in again.
Allergic reaction.

503
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:11,898
Mixed up two of her meds.

504
00:27:11,965 --> 00:27:14,568
They said that she's been
kind of out of it since the attack.

505
00:27:15,168 --> 00:27:17,170
One of the nurses saw your bulletin.

506
00:27:17,704 --> 00:27:18,872
Thank her for us.

507
00:27:19,473 --> 00:27:20,607
It's a him, actually.

508
00:27:21,708 --> 00:27:23,176
They're in Consultation.

509
00:27:24,578 --> 00:27:25,512
How is Tavon?

510
00:27:26,446 --> 00:27:27,381
He's the same.

511
00:27:30,851 --> 00:27:32,753
Excuse me. Could I talk with you a moment?

512
00:27:39,993 --> 00:27:42,729
Detective Wyms. Detective Wagenbach.

513
00:27:43,463 --> 00:27:44,464
How's your mother?

514
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:46,800
She'll be just fine.

515
00:27:47,401 --> 00:27:50,337
- What's this all about?
- We wondered if we could talk to her

516
00:27:50,404 --> 00:27:52,272
about that robbery last month.

517
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:53,640
Why now?

518
00:27:53,707 --> 00:27:56,943
We think your mother might be able
to help us find the person who did it.

519
00:28:09,489 --> 00:28:10,490
It's not here.

520
00:28:16,229 --> 00:28:17,898
Police! Don't move.

521
00:28:17,964 --> 00:28:19,099
Keep your hands in the open.

522
00:28:19,833 --> 00:28:22,002
Hey! Don't move! Don't make me do it, man.

523
00:28:22,502 --> 00:28:24,204
Stop right there.
Put your hands in the air.

524
00:28:24,838 --> 00:28:26,106
Don't make it worse for yourself.

525
00:28:27,274 --> 00:28:28,075
Turn around.

526
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:33,313
On your knees, man.

527
00:28:44,324 --> 00:28:45,459
Hey!

528
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:47,861
Hey, man.

529
00:28:49,629 --> 00:28:50,997
Hey, don't make this mistake.

530
00:28:51,798 --> 00:28:52,833
I'm a police officer.

531
00:28:57,637 --> 00:28:58,638
So you a cop?

532
00:28:59,339 --> 00:29:01,108
That mean you can do
whatever the hell you want?

533
00:29:02,676 --> 00:29:03,477
Hey.

534
00:29:04,778 --> 00:29:06,012
You can still get out of this.

535
00:29:07,514 --> 00:29:08,982
Now you telling me what to do.

536
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,455
Hey, man,
you need to calm your friend down.

537
00:29:17,491 --> 00:29:19,393
Tie him up. Tie him up with something.

538
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:26,266
Put out your hands.

539
00:29:34,007 --> 00:29:35,075
Hurry up.

540
00:29:39,212 --> 00:29:40,447
Don't throw your life away.

541
00:29:42,149 --> 00:29:45,052
I ain't afraid of prison.
But you should be.

542
00:29:47,587 --> 00:29:48,688
You ever...

543
00:29:50,957 --> 00:29:53,593
suck a xxxx like a cell bitch, cop man?

544
00:29:55,962 --> 00:29:56,997
Don't do this.

545
00:29:58,965 --> 00:30:00,667
It's your turn to gag on something.

546
00:30:03,437 --> 00:30:04,237
No.

547
00:30:06,206 --> 00:30:07,641
Open up, sweetheart.

548
00:30:08,875 --> 00:30:09,876
No.

549
00:30:12,045 --> 00:30:13,346
You wanna die instead?

550
00:30:15,949 --> 00:30:16,850
No.

551
00:30:22,255 --> 00:30:23,256
Captain.

552
00:30:25,258 --> 00:30:26,393
That's great.

553
00:30:27,627 --> 00:30:29,296
Probably had a limo come pick him up.

554
00:30:33,533 --> 00:30:35,736
Can I get confirmation
on that pickup address?

555
00:30:35,802 --> 00:30:37,471
There's no one here
at our current location.

556
00:30:39,106 --> 00:30:41,808
<i>Negative, 1-Tango-16. Unable to confirm.</i>

557
00:30:45,712 --> 00:30:46,646
Let's head out.

558
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,788
They're gone.

559
00:31:02,062 --> 00:31:03,430
Let's see that mouth.

560
00:31:09,669 --> 00:31:13,106
- <i>El Presidente</i> around?
- Captain Aceveda? No.

561
00:31:13,173 --> 00:31:14,274
Where is he?

562
00:31:14,341 --> 00:31:16,676
Conducting a search at a suspect's house.

563
00:31:18,278 --> 00:31:21,014
Could you raise him on the horn for me?
I got an important question for him.

564
00:31:21,581 --> 00:31:25,152
I'll try, but I've left two messages
for him in the last 10 minutes.

565
00:31:26,019 --> 00:31:27,988
His cell-phone coverage is bad sometimes.

566
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,060
No.

567
00:31:36,096 --> 00:31:36,897
Thanks.

568
00:31:39,032 --> 00:31:40,367
Get your phone, man.

569
00:31:41,134 --> 00:31:42,602
- What?
- Your phone.

570
00:31:43,837 --> 00:31:45,438
I wanna get a Kodak of this.

571
00:31:48,441 --> 00:31:49,276
Okay.

572
00:31:51,111 --> 00:31:52,846
- You ready?
- Yeah.

573
00:32:01,855 --> 00:32:02,656
I got it.

574
00:32:02,722 --> 00:32:04,991
You don't remember anything else?

575
00:32:07,227 --> 00:32:09,095
There's nothing about his face?

576
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,232
His height?

577
00:32:20,207 --> 00:32:22,609
I'm gonna tell you something you're not
gonna like hearing very much Vince.

578
00:32:22,676 --> 00:32:25,479
I know, as a son,
it's the last thing I'd wanna hear.

579
00:32:25,545 --> 00:32:26,947
What's going on?

580
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:35,722
We think your mother wasn't just
knocked down by that guy last month.

581
00:32:35,789 --> 00:32:39,092
We believe he may have
sexually assaulted her.

582
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:40,327
Sexually.

583
00:32:40,393 --> 00:32:42,596
It would account for why
she's so distracted lately.

584
00:32:43,163 --> 00:32:45,932
- That's a lot of pain to push down.
- We hope we're wrong.

585
00:32:46,933 --> 00:32:49,035
Why don't you start by telling us
what happened that day?

586
00:32:49,102 --> 00:32:53,607
I found her lying on the kitchen floor.
She couldn't stop crying.

587
00:32:53,673 --> 00:32:56,710
- What else?
- Back window was broken.

588
00:32:57,344 --> 00:33:00,881
She said a guy came in, knocked her down,
grabbed a few things, then ran.

589
00:33:01,748 --> 00:33:03,583
She would've told me if...

590
00:33:06,453 --> 00:33:07,888
Maybe she needed more time.

591
00:33:11,158 --> 00:33:13,026
Yo, man, if he tells his boys, we're done.

592
00:33:19,232 --> 00:33:20,133
You gonna say anything?

593
00:33:22,202 --> 00:33:24,171
- No.
- Hey, you can't believe that shit.

594
00:33:25,071 --> 00:33:26,139
What? You wanna kill him?

595
00:33:27,073 --> 00:33:27,874
You do it.

596
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:30,977
You want it done...

597
00:33:32,045 --> 00:33:32,879
you do it.

598
00:33:35,448 --> 00:33:36,416
Hey, man.

599
00:33:37,684 --> 00:33:38,752
I have a little girl.

600
00:33:41,388 --> 00:33:42,255
I have a wife.

601
00:33:46,059 --> 00:33:46,860
Mother.

602
00:33:48,862 --> 00:33:49,963
Yo, man, you gotta do it.

603
00:33:50,564 --> 00:33:52,532
- I'll watch.
- You've been wanting the juice, man.

604
00:33:54,534 --> 00:33:55,335
Do it.

605
00:33:57,671 --> 00:33:58,805
If your mother were here...

606
00:33:59,306 --> 00:34:00,707
what would she tell you to do?

607
00:34:05,612 --> 00:34:06,680
Not this kind of juice, bro.

608
00:34:07,681 --> 00:34:08,915
Not this kind of juice.

609
00:34:15,188 --> 00:34:16,690
It's the other cop. Let's go.

610
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:26,867
I'm in here.

611
00:34:30,403 --> 00:34:31,238
<i>Bust the door.</i>

612
00:34:34,174 --> 00:34:37,010
<i>- It's locked. Try it again.</i>
<i>- I got it.</i>

613
00:34:39,346 --> 00:34:40,847
- He's here!
- Sweep it.

614
00:34:43,583 --> 00:34:44,951
- You all right?
- Yeah.

615
00:34:45,018 --> 00:34:46,353
- Clear.
- Clear.

616
00:34:48,054 --> 00:34:50,090
- They got my gun.
- They?

617
00:34:51,491 --> 00:34:52,425
Yeah.

618
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,295
- The two of them.
- Are you hurt?

619
00:34:57,397 --> 00:34:58,331
No.

620
00:34:59,366 --> 00:35:00,634
I was able to fight them off.

621
00:35:04,671 --> 00:35:05,572
Mom.

622
00:35:07,207 --> 00:35:10,343
I need you to tell me
what happened during the robbery.

623
00:35:12,646 --> 00:35:15,515
- I told you everything I remember.
- Have you?

624
00:35:18,118 --> 00:35:19,920
<i>What else did he do to you?</i>

625
00:35:22,956 --> 00:35:24,891
<i>Where are those police people?</i>

626
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:26,993
<i>He hurt you?</i>

627
00:35:29,763 --> 00:35:31,464
Stop it, Vincent.

628
00:35:32,365 --> 00:35:33,633
Raped you?

629
00:35:35,702 --> 00:35:36,770
Don't you say that.

630
00:35:37,737 --> 00:35:39,105
<i>Mom, did he?</i>

631
00:35:42,576 --> 00:35:43,376
<i>Yes, he did.</i>

632
00:35:45,011 --> 00:35:47,047
<i>Why didn't you tell me?</i>

633
00:35:48,181 --> 00:35:49,616
<i>Mama, why?</i>

634
00:36:11,304 --> 00:36:12,139
Hold it.

635
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:15,375
- You see something?
- Maybe.

636
00:36:24,818 --> 00:36:25,919
- Let's go.
- Yep.

637
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,788
- You can't keep me here.
- That's true.

638
00:36:28,855 --> 00:36:31,324
You'll probably make bail
sometime tomorrow.

639
00:36:32,058 --> 00:36:34,528
Trial won't be for another six months.

640
00:36:35,061 --> 00:36:36,296
But in between,

641
00:36:36,363 --> 00:36:39,299
every time you roll a stop sign,
I'm gonna hand you a ticket.

642
00:36:39,366 --> 00:36:42,869
Every lunch break you take,
I'm gonna be sitting at the next table.

643
00:36:42,936 --> 00:36:46,139
- Yeah, that's harassment.
- No, Lyle. That's stalking.

644
00:36:53,013 --> 00:36:54,748
Hey, you okay?

645
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:57,851
Yeah, I had a little run-in.

646
00:36:59,186 --> 00:37:00,353
No harm done.

647
00:37:01,822 --> 00:37:03,290
Let's not waste any time on it.

648
00:37:04,524 --> 00:37:05,559
Hey, what happened?

649
00:37:06,259 --> 00:37:08,061
He fended off a couple of bad guys.

650
00:37:08,695 --> 00:37:10,864
Miracle he hasn't called
a press conference yet.

651
00:37:18,972 --> 00:37:21,341
She's in there alone
with her husband's service weapon.

652
00:37:21,408 --> 00:37:23,143
My key wasn't working in the new lock.

653
00:37:23,677 --> 00:37:26,112
- She shot at me when I opened the door.
- You okay?

654
00:37:26,847 --> 00:37:28,248
Come on, I told you to stay in the car.

655
00:37:29,382 --> 00:37:30,484
Luann.

656
00:37:43,997 --> 00:37:44,798
Luann?

657
00:37:49,803 --> 00:37:50,737
Luann?

658
00:37:56,576 --> 00:37:59,613
- Can you drop the gun?
- Put the gun down, Luann.

659
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:07,754
It's okay, sweetheart.

660
00:38:08,421 --> 00:38:09,756
I know what happened to you.

661
00:38:11,124 --> 00:38:12,225
That's our wedding.

662
00:38:14,494 --> 00:38:15,695
You were very beautiful.

663
00:38:16,263 --> 00:38:17,831
I was a size 4.

664
00:38:21,968 --> 00:38:23,737
Can you tell me what happened to you?

665
00:38:32,112 --> 00:38:33,180
He robbed me.

666
00:38:34,681 --> 00:38:37,684
I didn't want to get robbed again.

667
00:38:43,089 --> 00:38:44,224
Hey, Cassy.

668
00:38:45,392 --> 00:38:46,827
Hi, Mr. Mackey.

669
00:38:46,893 --> 00:38:49,429
- Cassidy, Owen said hello to you.
- Hey.

670
00:38:51,364 --> 00:38:53,266
Sorry. She's struggling
with this whole thing.

671
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:54,201
It's okay.

672
00:38:55,735 --> 00:38:56,603
Hey, little man.

673
00:38:57,437 --> 00:38:58,905
I'm drawing a zoo.

674
00:38:59,973 --> 00:39:02,409
- Hey, that's great, Matty.
- Corrine's in with Megan.

675
00:39:04,978 --> 00:39:06,046
Hey.

676
00:39:09,616 --> 00:39:12,285
- How did she do with Dr. Franks?
- You know shrinks.

677
00:39:12,352 --> 00:39:14,654
You ask them one question,
they give you five back.

678
00:39:15,522 --> 00:39:17,624
She's being quiet and a little stubborn.

679
00:39:17,691 --> 00:39:19,426
He wants you and l to do sessions too.

680
00:39:19,493 --> 00:39:20,460
One on one.

681
00:39:21,061 --> 00:39:24,231
I want her to get all the help she needs
but me laying down on a couch?

682
00:39:24,297 --> 00:39:27,200
- It's not gonna happen.
- Stubborn and incommunicative.

683
00:39:27,267 --> 00:39:28,835
Wonder where she gets that from?

684
00:39:30,103 --> 00:39:33,106
- How is Tavon doing?
- The last surgery gave him some hope.

685
00:39:33,173 --> 00:39:35,408
The brain-tissue bruising
isn't bad as they thought.

686
00:39:35,475 --> 00:39:38,178
- That's good.
- The next 48 hours should tell.

687
00:39:38,245 --> 00:39:39,212
Good.

688
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:47,754
If he recovers, would he be able
to remember anything that happened?

689
00:39:48,655 --> 00:39:51,158
I got him working on this
undercover assignment.

690
00:39:51,691 --> 00:39:53,560
Well, he could remember every detail.

691
00:39:53,627 --> 00:39:56,997
Or he could wake up and barely
recognize his own reflection.

692
00:39:58,965 --> 00:40:01,501
If Tavon lives, he could remember
everything that happened.

693
00:40:01,968 --> 00:40:05,906
If he dies, an autopsy could reveal
the blow to the head before the crash.

694
00:40:11,278 --> 00:40:12,312
We'll figure it out, baby.

695
00:40:14,548 --> 00:40:16,116
Chew on this, baby.

696
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:20,220
We just found out the feds
marked some of our money train cash.

697
00:40:20,987 --> 00:40:22,722
- What?
- Part of a sting they're doing

698
00:40:22,789 --> 00:40:23,890
on the Armenians.

699
00:40:26,193 --> 00:40:27,961
- Shit.
- Deep.

700
00:40:29,062 --> 00:40:30,263
And if that's not enough,

701
00:40:30,997 --> 00:40:34,301
this accident leads back to you without us
getting self-defense on the books...

702
00:40:35,402 --> 00:40:37,604
I.A.D. could be all over you
right at the time

703
00:40:37,671 --> 00:40:39,172
we're gonna cash in on the money train.

704
00:40:40,607 --> 00:40:41,475
So, what do we do?

705
00:40:42,909 --> 00:40:43,810
Now it's "we."

706
00:40:46,346 --> 00:40:47,514
Tell me the truth.

707
00:40:48,081 --> 00:40:48,882
I did.

708
00:40:51,184 --> 00:40:52,185
You had a fight.

709
00:40:52,853 --> 00:40:54,788
- One of you hit him.
- It was self-defense.

710
00:40:57,023 --> 00:41:00,126
If you both tell your story right now,
this could all go away.

711
00:41:03,697 --> 00:41:05,165
Look, we gotta make a decision.

712
00:41:06,299 --> 00:41:07,300
Right now.

713
00:41:08,935 --> 00:41:10,470
Which road are we going down?

714
00:41:10,537 --> 00:41:12,806
Look, everybody knew
Tavon and I had bad blood.

715
00:41:18,645 --> 00:41:20,180
No, we gotta make this disappear.

716
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:27,721
We think this cuddler rapist
has been around for a while.

717
00:41:28,488 --> 00:41:31,925
We've looked at like-crimes.
We've interviewed dozens of women.

718
00:41:31,992 --> 00:41:36,329
We've confirmed three victims,
which is required for his analysis.

719
00:41:36,396 --> 00:41:40,367
Mueller's results have been proven
accurate down to the square block.

720
00:41:40,433 --> 00:41:44,271
We match this with known offenders,
we narrow our search dramatically.

721
00:41:45,138 --> 00:41:46,973
Well, if this Mueller can help,
then let him.

722
00:41:47,607 --> 00:41:49,142
Mueller isn't free.

723
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:51,578
- His fee is $5000.
- Right.

724
00:41:54,581 --> 00:41:55,515
It can't happen.

725
00:41:55,582 --> 00:41:58,718
We're really at a standstill on this.
Stranger perpetrator.

726
00:41:58,785 --> 00:42:01,054
The victims could pile up
until he makes a mistake.

727
00:42:01,121 --> 00:42:02,689
And so far, he hasn't made one.

728
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:04,724
Captain?

729
00:42:05,358 --> 00:42:06,359
No. I said, no.

730
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:08,261
We don't have the money.

731
00:42:09,963 --> 00:42:11,198
All right, roll up that rug.

732
00:42:12,165 --> 00:42:14,634
Hit some yard sales,
pick up a new rug and a table.

733
00:42:15,569 --> 00:42:16,536
Picture too.

734
00:42:17,904 --> 00:42:19,005
Use cash.

735
00:42:19,573 --> 00:42:22,108
I'll drop by this weekend
and help you patch that wall.

736
00:42:23,143 --> 00:42:24,144
What did you hit him with?

737
00:42:29,549 --> 00:42:30,617
Nice paperweight.

738
00:42:31,218 --> 00:42:32,919
Put that in the truck with the rug.

739
00:42:32,986 --> 00:42:35,689
It's a brand-new iron.
I washed it. It's clean.

740
00:42:36,656 --> 00:42:37,891
We'll get a new one.

741
00:42:38,892 --> 00:42:41,661
Put the broken table on my truck.
I'll dump that too.

742
00:42:52,739 --> 00:42:54,508
This is dangerous,
you know that, don't you?

743
00:42:56,943 --> 00:42:58,745
It's not my fault that he crashed.

744
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:01,081
You mean, it's not Shane's fault.

745
00:43:04,784 --> 00:43:06,153
He must really love you.

746
00:43:08,421 --> 00:43:09,923
He's doing what he thinks is right.

747
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:12,259
- What do you think is right?
- I trust him.

748
00:43:17,998 --> 00:43:19,966
We're gonna cover our tracks
the best we can.

749
00:43:20,901 --> 00:43:22,369
But if push comes to shove...

750
00:43:22,903 --> 00:43:24,905
you gotta step up and tell the truth.

751
00:43:25,872 --> 00:43:29,442
DA never gonna pursue the conviction
of a pregnant woman

752
00:43:29,509 --> 00:43:31,478
trying to protect the father of her child.

753
00:43:31,545 --> 00:43:33,513
It's not how Shane wants to do it.

754
00:43:34,181 --> 00:43:36,550
He'll do it however you tell him to do it.

755
00:43:37,484 --> 00:43:38,618
Is everything okay?

756
00:43:39,786 --> 00:43:40,587
Sure.

757
00:43:41,454 --> 00:43:42,589
Sweetheart, let me get that.

758
00:43:44,825 --> 00:43:45,625
Hey.

759
00:43:46,359 --> 00:43:47,360
Luminol.

760
00:43:47,861 --> 00:43:49,830
Spray it all around. Use the light.

761
00:43:51,097 --> 00:43:52,332
Blood traces will glow.

762
00:43:53,233 --> 00:43:54,201
Here, I...

763
00:43:55,735 --> 00:43:58,538
Fumes could be dangerous to the baby.
Cleanup is on you.

764
00:44:01,341 --> 00:44:03,043
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

765
00:44:13,386 --> 00:44:17,190
Sir, we caught that stalker lurking
behind the victim's house last night.

766
00:44:17,257 --> 00:44:18,058
Good.

767
00:44:19,426 --> 00:44:20,927
Just thought you'd like to know, sir.

768
00:44:20,994 --> 00:44:23,163
- Captain.
- I need your signature.

769
00:44:30,837 --> 00:44:33,173
- You ready for the monthly reports?
- Not yet.
