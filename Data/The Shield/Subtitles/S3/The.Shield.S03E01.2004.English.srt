1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:02,469
<i>Last season on "The Shield".</i>

2
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:06,039
- Hey!
- Who searched that guy?

3
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:09,342
- I did.
- Armadillo's death in the cage.

4
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:12,479
I got suspended for that. I paid
the price. You're firing me for it?

5
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:14,681
It makes it awfully hard
to defend this place...

6
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,816
...to the Chief when I
see crap like this.

7
00:00:16,816 --> 00:00:18,518
Start acting like adults.

8
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:20,220
You gave that faggot
a blanket party...

9
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,989
...knowing full well you'd like to
be lying under the blanket with him.

10
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:24,357
Five across.

11
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:26,826
They're gonna have the most PC
useless force in the country.

12
00:00:26,826 --> 00:00:28,128
Julien gets outted and
throws a xxxxx fit...

13
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:30,263
...and we take the fall for
some friendly ribbing?

14
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:36,369
You're running for office.

15
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:39,105
I'll leave you as Captain
until that run is over.

16
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:41,141
If you win you graduate
to City Council.

17
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:44,010
If you lose the primary
you resign quietly.

18
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,013
If you offered me that
job, I'd take it.

19
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:49,616
- So now you want it?
- No.

20
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:51,718
- But I'll take it.
<i>- It's a save bet...</i>

21
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:54,020
<i>...that Aceveda will soon
be the first elected...</i>

22
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,189
<i>...Hispanic representative
on the Council...</i>

23
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:58,291
- I thought he was gonna lose.
- He's supposed to.

24
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:00,126
- What does that mean?
- In six months from now,...

25
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:02,062
...he's gonna be our boss' boss.

26
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,897
You wanna rip off the Armenian mob?

27
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,366
- Right into our pockets.
- Where are we with the money train?

28
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:07,967
It's definitely pulling out tonight.

29
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:09,602
What about the guy who
ran the last site?

30
00:01:09,602 --> 00:01:12,572
His name's Chorekian.
He's the advance man.

31
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,541
Follow him. Maybe he'll
take us to the new site.

32
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:17,177
You saw him hit me?

33
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:18,812
- I saw it.
- You be my witness?

34
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:20,046
For insurance.

35
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:21,981
Yeah, I guess I could do that.

36
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:24,017
I'm Armin Chorekian.

37
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:25,985
Cletis Van Damm.

38
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,826
Jesus Christ.

39
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:35,628
This is not good. Where is Vic?

40
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:37,430
Come on. We're gonna do this now.

41
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,466
- Get down right now!
- Get down!

42
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:41,201
What the hell happened here?

43
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:43,603
- We got dead bodies?
- I wasn't us.

44
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,405
They turned on each other.

45
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:53,046
One big hit, in and out,
we're set for good.

46
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:57,717
- Open up!
- She saw you, asshole!

47
00:01:57,717 --> 00:01:59,552
- Open up!
- Goddamn peeping Tom.

48
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,488
- Open up!
- Put down the bats.

49
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:03,089
That prick saw my mother naked!

50
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:05,959
- Peeping into our bedroom window.
- He saw me! He saw...!

51
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,694
Drop the goddamn bats!

52
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:10,663
- What about him? He's the criminal.
- Hands behind your head.

53
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:12,165
There he is!

54
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:14,868
- I want them both locked up.
- He was jerking off!

55
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:15,969
He's a pervert!

56
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,772
How will I get off
on those saggy tits?

57
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:20,774
She shouldn't leave her blinds up?

58
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:23,176
You read me my rights.

59
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:25,678
- Lock them up.
- Could you shut him down?

60
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:27,580
Step inside, sir. Close the door.

61
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,817
- She's nothing to look at.
- Julien. Hey, Julien.

62
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,119
Am I working alone here?

63
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:35,588
- I saw you outside.
- Lock him up.

64
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:52,038
Dinky's having a slow morning.

65
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:57,010
We're killing a morning babysitting
a third-string dime bagger.

66
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,480
- Can't get much lower than this.
- Every bust's a good bust.

67
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,116
And one step closer to cashing
in on a small fortune.

68
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:06,619
Playing by the rules keeps
LA from our retirement fund.

69
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:09,322
Fill the chief's arrest quotas,
keeps our noses clean.

70
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:11,958
- Yeah, or in your case, brown.
- Shut up.

71
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,493
What's up, man?

72
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:16,396
Plus I get you two assholes
to keep me entertained.

73
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,565
I got you, man.

74
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:23,636
- Packing already?
- Just tidying up.

75
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,106
You and Claudette wanna
take a run at this.

76
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:30,710
- I'm already working two open cases.
- I'm sorry we're so short-handed.

77
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:34,681
I had some budget ideas about that.
If you give me access to personnel...

78
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:37,150
You're on detective duty
for a few more days.

79
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,153
So why don't you stick
to that for now?

80
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:43,857
Get down there. It's a double
homicide with special circumstances.

81
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:46,893
What special circumstances?

82
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,697
Someone forgot their fins.

83
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:53,533
Armenian immigrants.

84
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:57,437
Both had multiple arrests,
and both did prison time.

85
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:59,639
Post-mortem cuts.

86
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:02,542
One foot's a trophy.
Four's just plain weird.

87
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,346
They were dumped here. Killing
zone's somewhere else.

88
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:09,415
Given any thought to who you'll
bring on as my new partner?

89
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:12,318
Like the captain said,
I'm still a detective.

90
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:14,354
Three more days.

91
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:17,056
There's a Detective Ruiz
in Hollywood that's good.

92
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:18,925
Gabrielle Ruiz?

93
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:22,295
Gabrielle's quite a looker.

94
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:23,763
Is she?

95
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:30,436
No?

96
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:35,341
Wait.

97
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:41,214
Okay, run this, "4UOP21 1."

98
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:43,383
Hey, Ronnie, Tavon, you seeing this?

99
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:45,785
<i>Yeah, we got them.
Looks like juveniles.</i>

100
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,820
"R. Mark Lindman, MD."

101
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:52,892
I hope the doctor's kids
know some lawyer friends.

102
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:57,163
Bust it out!

103
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,732
- Here he comes.
- Shit. Hey, you.

104
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:01,367
- Give me your keys, here.
- Okay.

105
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:02,635
- Hey!
- Give me your keys.

106
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,671
Don't do it! Don't you...

107
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:07,140
- Go, go!
- Goddamn it.

108
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,675
Stay right here.

109
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:12,912
Get the kid!

110
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,385
Get your hands on the wheel.

111
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:23,056
- You're gonna lose him.
- Go. Get out of the way. Goddamn it!

112
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,627
Six-Paul-1 1, in pursuit of
a mid-'80s Monte Carlo...

113
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:30,330
...headed south on Water
towards Palm Heights.

114
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,864
We're losing him.

115
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,269
Chopper's got him. He's
not going anywhere.

116
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:39,672
Besides, we're staying out of trouble.
Let some other unit wreck their car.

117
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,408
<i>Six-Paul-1 1, your suspect
ran a stop sign...</i>

118
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:46,145
<i>...is now traveling southbound at
a high speed along Cesar Chavez.</i>

119
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:48,581
<i>Three Monte Carlos turning
onto Chicago Street.</i>

120
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:53,119
<i>Look out. We got a C.A.
involving multiple vehicles.</i>

121
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,657
<i>This is Air-9 requesting R.A. to
the intersection of Cesar Chavez.</i>

122
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,566
- Stop! Lem, handle this.
- Hey!

123
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,306
You all right? Are you all right?

124
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:26,953
Cut him off!

125
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:34,894
Stay down.

126
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:47,707
I got it.

127
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:50,843
I got him.

128
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,228
Yo, I need a knife.

129
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:10,863
The seatbelt's jammed.

130
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:13,332
Shit.

131
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:19,605
- Where's it coming from?
- I don't know. The van?

132
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,243
- Lem, get out of there!
- Almost got him.

133
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:28,648
Lem?

134
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:31,484
There's no one inside!

135
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:07,120
- You gonna take it easy?
- He's got a few burns. Mild shock.

136
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,888
He's in for a bigger one.

137
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,792
What happened here?

138
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:15,128
Car we were chasing
caused the smash-up.

139
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:17,764
The van swerved to
avoid it, caught fire.

140
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:19,266
Back was full of ammo.

141
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:23,270
- One hell of a fireworks show.
- Your chase caused this accident?

142
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:27,307
Felony pursuit, under control,
we followed regulations to a T.

143
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:32,045
Give me that report right away. I want
all my ducks in a row for downtown.

144
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:37,817
Hey, Dutch boy. I got a case for you.

145
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:39,753
Actually, I'm working
a double homicide.

146
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:42,355
Yeah? Well, I need a detective
to hand this off to...

147
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,724
...so I can get back to dealer duty.

148
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:47,594
Rodriguez might be back tonight.
How important is it?

149
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:48,862
I don't know yet.

150
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,497
All right, thanks anyway.

151
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:55,135
Hey. You know of any
internal Armenian mob beefs?

152
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:58,605
- Not offhand.
- How about off foot?

153
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:01,541
Found these guys this morning.
Harbor found two more last week.

154
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,109
Same shape.

155
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:07,180
Don't know them.

156
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,683
Looks like old-country
retribution though.

157
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:13,653
Somebody sure pissed off
the bosses back in...

158
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,089
Yerevan.

159
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:17,424
You're right.

160
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:20,327
Let me show these to my guys, see
if they recognize the stumps.

161
00:09:20,327 --> 00:09:21,861
Great. Thanks.

162
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:25,465
They killed these Armenians
looking for our money-train cash.

163
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:27,434
They think it was an inside job.

164
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:30,537
What happens when they realize
it was an outside job?

165
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:33,006
There's four people who
know we took that money.

166
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:35,608
They're all sitting right here.
Stick to the plan.

167
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:37,610
Low profile. Business as usual.

168
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:48,421
- You pull our driver's sheet?
- Ain't got one.

169
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,056
He's an out-of-work cement mixer.

170
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,561
A van full of ammo, Jesse?

171
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:57,731
It is not against the
law to have bullets.

172
00:09:57,731 --> 00:10:00,166
Well, it is if you drive
them across state lines.

173
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:04,437
You wanna tell me why you took a
Greyhound to Yuma, Arizona...

174
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,173
...picked up a van, filled it
with half a ton of 9 shells...

175
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:10,043
...and drove it all the
way back here to L.A.?

176
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:13,580
- Told not against the law.
- Who told you that?

177
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,382
Your son Diagur?

178
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:19,552
See, he's a player with the Byz Lats.

179
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:22,088
Is that who you're running ammo for?

180
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:24,457
He float his out-of-work
pop a day job?

181
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,726
Diagur is not in this.

182
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,930
There's no sign of a struggle
in either victims' apartment...

183
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,900
...but both their cars were
parked in their slots.

184
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,503
They went along willingly
with whoever killed them.

185
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:39,406
- Someone they were comfortable with.
- Armenian mobsters.

186
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:41,107
Anything more specific?

187
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:43,977
You remember Margos Dezirian?
The Jesus look-alike.

188
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:46,513
The Armenian drug guy who
killed a man in our cage?

189
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:49,149
- Then escaped the paddy wagon.
- You think he's involved?

190
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:53,686
It would explain the severed feet.
Margos is a big foot-fetish guy.

191
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:55,422
How do you know that?

192
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:59,626
In custody, the only words he said
were "delicious feet" to Danny.

193
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:01,060
I gave her a call.

194
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:04,531
She said he was constantly staring
at her feet like he was obsessed.

195
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:08,968
Well, it's not the only
lead we're chasing.

196
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:12,105
If I'm right, Dezirian's
back in town.

197
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:14,674
- I wanna bring in the feds.
- Based on a foot fetish?

198
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:18,912
If Dezirian's here, everybody wants
him. Us, Washington, Interpol.

199
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:22,582
Fine.

200
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:26,986
Hey, when I was talking to Danny,
she mentioned her final appeal...

201
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:29,088
...with the police
commission is tomorrow.

202
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:32,025
A good word from her boss,
future city councilman...

203
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,961
- ...might go a long way.
- I'm aware of the situation.

204
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:45,472
- You almost all packed up?
- What can I do for you?

205
00:11:45,472 --> 00:11:48,007
One last favor before
you ride out of Dodge.

206
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:49,375
What's that?

207
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,612
It looks like one of the Latin gangs
is arming up for Armageddon...

208
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:55,482
...and I can't find a free
detective to look into it.

209
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:57,116
We're understaffed.

210
00:11:57,116 --> 00:12:00,653
I got a vanload of ammo
driven by a Byz Lat dad.

211
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:04,224
- Where there's bullets, there's guns.
- Did the driver confess to guns?

212
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,659
It's gonna take some legwork
to prove I'm right.

213
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:10,330
In the meantime, I got actual murders,
armed robberies that take priority.

214
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,732
You're not interested
in preventing murders?

215
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,667
- Why don't you look into it?
- Fine.

216
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:18,371
Talk to the chief. Get him to back off
this arrest quota. I can't do both.

217
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:21,241
I can't get in whatever
arrangement the chief has.

218
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,810
- Can't?
- Won't.

219
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:26,946
More important things to worry
about than guns on the street?

220
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:29,148
I'll assign a detective
when one frees up.

221
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:33,086
Did you finish up the paperwork
on this morning's car accident?

222
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,654
Yeah.

223
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:38,024
- Lem.
- Yeah?

224
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:40,627
- You finish that accident report?
- Yeah.

225
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:44,531
- You said he wanted me to write that.
- He does. You done?

226
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:49,802
- Hi, guys.
- Hey.

227
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:51,738
- We in your way?
- No, we're just...

228
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:54,173
We're just finishing up.
Sorry to interrupt.

229
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:58,077
Just needed to ask a
question and sneak a kiss.

230
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:02,282
You buying a car?

231
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,816
Yes.

232
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:06,653
Yes, we are. I'm getting my
Realtor's license next week.

233
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:10,924
So I need a respectable
ride to show homes.

234
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:12,458
Really?

235
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,428
Yeah, I'm just helping out
with the down payment.

236
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:19,732
- He's the best.
- Yeah, the best.

237
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:21,768
So we're gonna meet
after work, right?

238
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:24,237
- Dream Motor Cars, off Sepulveda.
- Yeah, okay.

239
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:26,172
- Okay.
- Okay.

240
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:29,909
- I'll see you there.
- Okay.

241
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:31,778
- Bye.
- See you.

242
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,614
Bye-bye.

243
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:40,620
Go with Lem and Ronnie, keep
the dime-bag busts rolling.

244
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:42,622
Go.

245
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:46,626
Come on, lover. You and me
are ditching school today.

246
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,064
Interpol's dossier
on Margos Dezirian.

247
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:53,967
He's suspected of killing
three coca farmers in Chile.

248
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:56,069
All found with their
feet chopped off.

249
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:57,503
Let me see.

250
00:13:58,171 --> 00:13:59,806
I need to run his known aliases...

251
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:03,076
...against international flight
manifests for the past month.

252
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:06,012
- He's in town.
- Detectives, you have visitors.

253
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:12,485
The two men you find
dead this morning.

254
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:14,120
I know who did it.

255
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:18,625
I see him waiting at my
home to kill me next.

256
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:22,462
My mother, my sister, her children.

257
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:24,664
If you protect us...

258
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:26,399
...I tell everything.

259
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:40,413
I know you, yes?

260
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:41,881
No, I don't think so.

261
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:45,785
Yes, you and your friend. Cletus.

262
00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:48,154
The accident that day.

263
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:52,392
The guy paid up, I never had to call.

264
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,193
Right. Yeah, that's good.

265
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:55,561
Cletus?

266
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,730
I did not know you
work for the police.

267
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,232
Yeah, I was off duty.

268
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:02,035
I'm on duty now. I gotta
get back to work.

269
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:07,173
Known this girl for two months,
you're buying a new car?

270
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:09,742
It's preowned. I'm covering
the down payment...

271
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,878
...she'll take over when
she makes her first sale.

272
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:14,981
What happened to keeping a low
profile? Business as usual?

273
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:16,716
I'm using my own money, on my Visa.

274
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:19,852
Looks like you're buying a new Lexus.

275
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:21,354
It's preowned.

276
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:24,490
Being up to my eyeballs in
debt is business as usual.

277
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,792
Nice try.

278
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:27,694
No sale, you got it?

279
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:30,496
- Vic.
- What?

280
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:33,266
Dutch is interviewing
the guy that saw us.

281
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,501
- What guy?
- Armin. The advance man.

282
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:38,504
- What's he doing here?
- I don't know, but he recognized me.

283
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:42,341
- He remembered your name, Cletus.
- Cletus Vandamn?

284
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:46,779
You gave the alias you used to rent
the storage where we hid the money?

285
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,248
Well, it makes Lem laugh.

286
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:52,552
Hey, Lem, you gonna ride with
the A-team today or what?

287
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:54,921
You were following this guy
the day we stole the money.

288
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:59,258
- lf he starts stringing the facts...
- lf Dutch does. He heard.

289
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:00,827
That's it.

290
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:04,464
We move the money tonight.
New location. New name.

291
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,470
That is not the man
doing the killing.

292
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,940
Are you sure? His
name's Margos Dezirian.

293
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,575
That is Margos?

294
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:17,510
Yeah, I've heard of the name...

295
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:21,647
...but it is Lyor Slavok you want.

296
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,483
Lyor Slavok?

297
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,785
He is a soldier.

298
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:30,423
Who gives him orders,
Margos, someone else...

299
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:31,891
...I do not know.

300
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:36,896
It's all because of
this damn money train.

301
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:45,705
I heard a rumor a while ago about a
money train. Somebody ripped it off?

302
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:49,509
The Armenians are gonna keep dropping
bodies until they find out who.

303
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:50,877
Shit.

304
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:55,014
The latest quarterly
crime statistics.

305
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:58,351
Jumped up double digits in all areas.

306
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:01,621
Well, the best thing you can
do for us in city council...

307
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:04,223
...is to find the money to
fully staff this place.

308
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:07,093
I don't take office for
another six months.

309
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:08,895
I'm worried about right now.

310
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:14,100
You said you had a few ideas
about adding personnel?

311
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:19,038
The undercover Decoy
Squad working Wilshire.

312
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,841
Their original mandate was to
rotate among all districts.

313
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:25,711
Well, Captain Griggs has used his
Miracle Mile clout to hold on to them.

314
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:29,182
Well, that's why their numbers at
Wilshire look a lot rosier than ours.

315
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:30,783
The unit's had great success.

316
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:32,618
Well, Griggs will never give them up.

317
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:38,157
I was thinking of appealing
higher up the ladder.

318
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:39,992
To the chief?

319
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,063
You don't have anything to offer him.
It'll make you look naive.

320
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:50,903
What other ideas do you have?

321
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:54,640
Hey!

322
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:58,077
Strike a pose, boys.

323
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:02,515
You. Get out of here, man.
Get out of here.

324
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,386
I'm gonna go out on a limb.

325
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:09,055
Diagur?

326
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:12,024
- What, you psychic?
- Yeah.

327
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:15,494
I predicted your old man would
crash a vanload of ammo.

328
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:18,698
He's fine. It's you
he's worried about.

329
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:20,833
- Me too.
- Vic.

330
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:29,442
Those 9 shells aren't for
these little cap guns.

331
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:32,178
You guys expecting a new
shipment of hardware?

332
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:36,249
- Who's running this boy's club now?
- Yeah, we missed the last election.

333
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:39,886
You guys looking to shoot your way
back into business and territory?

334
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:42,755
Well, you know, we'll
do what we gotta do.

335
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:44,523
Really?

336
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:48,060
If I find out you're arming with
anything more serious than this...

337
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,897
...I will turn the Byz Lats
into my personal pinata.

338
00:18:50,897 --> 00:18:54,734
Which means we shove candy up
your ass and beat you with a bat.

339
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:57,670
You pass it up the daisy chain.

340
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,312
Vic Mackey. My nigga.

341
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,447
Ain't seen you around
here in a while.

342
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:12,118
Yeah, we've been enjoying the sun.
New stuff?

343
00:19:12,118 --> 00:19:14,553
Religious erotica.

344
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:17,890
Where in the Bible does Saint Schlong
visit our lady of the D-cup?

345
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,326
I'm giving the believers
what they want.

346
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:21,861
So, what's the news?

347
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:25,431
- Anyone selling guns to the Byz Lats?
- Nope...

348
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:27,199
...but I found out who's buying.

349
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:29,201
Yeah? Who?

350
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:30,937
You know the cat.

351
00:19:30,937 --> 00:19:32,538
Lovely.

352
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:35,141
Let me see you spin around.

353
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,645
Nice.

354
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:41,614
- I might just...
- Hey.

355
00:19:41,614 --> 00:19:45,384
Drama. Hey, ladies, ladies, ladies,
could y'all bounce for a minute?

356
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:47,186
Everybody, come on.

357
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:53,092
Sweet setup.

358
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:54,927
- Thought you were broke.
- Hey.

359
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:57,897
Slap, easy, man, easy. Easy, baby.

360
00:19:57,897 --> 00:20:00,733
That's my boy, Slap. He got my back.

361
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:02,969
Whatever makes Slap happy.

362
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:09,475
- So who's financing this hot spot?
- You know. Found some investors.

363
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:11,811
Really? One-Niners buy a share?

364
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:14,547
Let's just say sometimes
you can go home again.

365
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:18,684
Come on. What's a gangster rapper like
you investing in heavy metal for?

366
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:20,886
We know you're making a
gun buy for your boys.

367
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,022
Well, you know wrong.

368
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:24,557
Really?

369
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,126
You know what?

370
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:30,396
We could make half our quota by
emptying the pockets in this room.

371
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,531
- Let's go. Hands on your heads.
- All right. Hold up.

372
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:34,900
Calm down, Hee-Haw. All right, man.

373
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:37,803
Yeah, I'm buying, okay?

374
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:40,139
But not because I want
to, because I got to.

375
00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:43,509
The Byz Lats arming themselves
to the mother-tit with MP5s.

376
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:46,846
- Jesus Christ. Fully auto SMGs?
- Three dozen.

377
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:49,015
My boys just looking for
a balance of power.

378
00:20:49,015 --> 00:20:51,283
- Byz Lats already have them?
- I don't know.

379
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:54,086
Same guy selling to me,
selling to them too.

380
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,222
Who's running this arms race?

381
00:20:56,222 --> 00:20:57,990
He's regular Army.

382
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:02,361
- When's your buy?
- What about the Byz Lats?

383
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:04,530
They got it in their
greasy little heads...

384
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,432
...that south of Vermont
belongs to them.

385
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,334
I'll disarm the Mexicans.

386
00:21:10,036 --> 00:21:12,638
And I'm supposed to believe that?

387
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:16,275
You forget last time we did business,
how you just shit all over me?

388
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:19,912
That was a onetime war
crime, and I apologized.

389
00:21:19,912 --> 00:21:22,014
Now, what time's the buy and where?

390
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:26,919
You make me find out on my own,
you'll be facing a charge too.

391
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:33,059
- Detective Holland Wagenbach?
- Yeah.

392
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:37,663
Agent Quigley, U.S. Treasury.

393
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:40,800
- I asked for FBI.
- You got me.

394
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:44,737
I understand you have an Armenian
who wants to come clean.

395
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:46,338
Already has.

396
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:48,140
Who's the boss around here?

397
00:21:49,075 --> 00:21:51,377
We've been concerned
with the Armenian mob...

398
00:21:51,377 --> 00:21:53,546
...shipping U.S. currency overseas.

399
00:21:53,546 --> 00:21:56,715
About four months ago, my office
instituted a sting operation.

400
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:58,617
What kind of sting operation?

401
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:02,054
In San Jose, the Armenians were
extorting a local businessman.

402
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:05,024
He allowed us to insert $50,000
of marked, traceable bills...

403
00:22:05,024 --> 00:22:08,227
...into his payment to the Armenians
so we could track the loot.

404
00:22:08,227 --> 00:22:10,196
See what banks were
washing the money.

405
00:22:10,196 --> 00:22:12,364
- And?
- Not a single bill has popped up...

406
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:14,834
...in three months.
It's mystified us.

407
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:18,370
But then today, I was notified
by my counterpart in the FBI...

408
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,373
...that you were investigating
a robbery of the mob.

409
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:23,209
And four related murders.

410
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,213
We may have blown our
laundering case...

411
00:22:27,213 --> 00:22:29,281
...but if any of these
marked bills show up...

412
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:31,117
...they might lead
you to your killers.

413
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:41,093
Someone inside?

414
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,837
Hey, I thought I heard
you guys in here.

415
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:54,306
Albert, Albert Kreeg.
I'm the manager.

416
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:58,177
Looks like you guys got
everything in okay.

417
00:22:58,177 --> 00:23:01,547
- Yeah, we're all set, Al.
- Albert, like the prince.

418
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:04,717
- Yeah. We're good, Albert.
- Okay.

419
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:07,586
Okay.

420
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:09,788
Did you just move out a place?

421
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:13,826
- Yeah, I'm getting divorced.
- Yeah, I had a feeling.

422
00:23:15,094 --> 00:23:18,030
Which one of the two of you is Mr.
London?

423
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:21,000
- That's me.
- Okay, I got those spare keys...

424
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,002
- ...that you asked for.
- Thank you.

425
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,775
All right then.

426
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:31,243
- Night.
- Night.

427
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,811
Night.

428
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,254
Get new padlocks. I don't
want Prince Curious...

429
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:45,624
- ...having a key to this place.
- Yeah.

430
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,629
- Yeah?
- Vic, we need you down here.

431
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,323
Someone slapped Slappy.

432
00:24:19,258 --> 00:24:21,093
Well, the Byz Lats got their guns.

433
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:30,269
So much for passing this case off.

434
00:24:42,782 --> 00:24:44,617
I don't think this guy is showing.

435
00:24:46,052 --> 00:24:47,687
Where is he?

436
00:24:48,454 --> 00:24:50,022
Guess he got spooked.

437
00:24:56,429 --> 00:24:57,763
That's bullshit.

438
00:24:58,264 --> 00:25:00,700
Your homeys are chilling
like it's happy hour.

439
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:04,403
- You thought I'd buy this pony show?
- You best just back up off me.

440
00:25:04,403 --> 00:25:06,639
You're pissed off about
losing your boy.

441
00:25:06,639 --> 00:25:08,374
How'd you feel if it was your boys?

442
00:25:08,374 --> 00:25:10,710
Still doesn't give you
license to bend me over.

443
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:14,881
Look, he didn't show, okay?
Ain't my fault. He...

444
00:25:14,881 --> 00:25:16,649
- Hey!
- Hey!

445
00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:18,985
- Don't even think about it.
- He reached.

446
00:25:18,985 --> 00:25:21,554
- I didn't reach.
- Get your hands out of your pockets.

447
00:25:21,554 --> 00:25:23,122
Yo, just do it, son.

448
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,759
Vic, just take it easy, all right?

449
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:28,661
I'm telling you the truth, man.

450
00:25:29,395 --> 00:25:31,831
When you get a new time and
place, you let us know.

451
00:25:31,831 --> 00:25:34,367
I'll call you as soon
as I know something.

452
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:35,801
Straight.

453
00:25:36,435 --> 00:25:38,137
All right, Vic.

454
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:39,472
Let's go.

455
00:25:41,974 --> 00:25:43,676
I'll be waiting for your call.

456
00:25:48,781 --> 00:25:50,716
Why don't you just calm down, man?

457
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:52,118
He's lying.

458
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:57,924
Why'd you say you'd help me?
This is so embarrassing.

459
00:25:57,924 --> 00:25:59,692
I'm sorry. I want to help you, I do.

460
00:25:59,692 --> 00:26:01,394
It's just I've talked
to some friends...

461
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:04,297
...this can add stress
to a new relationship.

462
00:26:04,297 --> 00:26:07,499
- What friends? Vic?
- Come on, it's not like that.

463
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:09,302
I worked to get this
Realtor's license.

464
00:26:09,302 --> 00:26:10,469
Yeah, I know that.

465
00:26:10,469 --> 00:26:13,973
I need to make a living. Would you
buy a half-million-dollar home...

466
00:26:13,973 --> 00:26:17,143
- ...from somebody driving a '97 Neon?
- From you? Sure.

467
00:26:22,548 --> 00:26:25,818
Because your mother doesn't want
you bouncing off the walls.

468
00:26:25,818 --> 00:26:28,454
- Mommy, can I have some ice cream?
- Come on.

469
00:26:28,454 --> 00:26:31,424
Go. Put on your p.j.'s. Come on,
get dressed. Let's go, come on.

470
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:33,292
- No fair.
- Come on. Go.

471
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:36,495
- Hey, what's going on?
- Look.

472
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:38,698
And what's this?

473
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:41,300
Daddy and me.

474
00:26:42,001 --> 00:26:43,402
That's great.

475
00:26:46,172 --> 00:26:48,207
This is your favorite
part, right, Matt?

476
00:26:49,008 --> 00:26:53,245
- Princess, go play with your sister.
- This is where the song ends, right?

477
00:26:53,245 --> 00:26:54,981
Bye, song.

478
00:26:56,916 --> 00:26:59,218
See you next time, okay, champ?

479
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:01,020
Bye.

480
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,621
Bye, Daddy.

481
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:04,690
I love you, Matt.

482
00:27:05,691 --> 00:27:07,426
He's got a great energy.

483
00:27:08,828 --> 00:27:11,230
That classical music
you were playing...?

484
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:13,099
It's the Tomatis Method.

485
00:27:13,099 --> 00:27:16,168
Matt's learning to use his ears
as his source of hearing...

486
00:27:16,168 --> 00:27:19,705
...so his other senses don't get
overwhelmed. He's responding well.

487
00:27:19,705 --> 00:27:21,007
Yeah.

488
00:27:21,007 --> 00:27:23,576
- Remember to do his drills with him.
- I will.

489
00:27:23,576 --> 00:27:25,644
Mr. Mackey, it was nice to meet you.

490
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,082
- I'll just let myself out.
- Okay.

491
00:27:34,453 --> 00:27:35,788
So I'll see you next time.

492
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,162
Told you he was amazing.

493
00:27:44,764 --> 00:27:46,298
Matthew's actually talking.

494
00:27:46,298 --> 00:27:48,300
We can have Owen two
more nights a week.

495
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:51,837
He has another job offer, but he wants
to work with Matthew full-time.

496
00:27:53,406 --> 00:27:56,809
Things are kind of tight right now.
How much is it gonna cost?

497
00:27:56,809 --> 00:27:59,178
An extra 300 a week.

498
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:00,613
Okay.

499
00:28:00,613 --> 00:28:03,282
Look, I gotta get back to the job.
Book him.

500
00:28:03,282 --> 00:28:04,950
I'll figure out how
I'm gonna cover it.

501
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:07,219
I only need for you to pay for half.

502
00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:09,455
I'm gonna take care of the rest.

503
00:28:10,456 --> 00:28:12,425
I'm going back to work.

504
00:28:12,425 --> 00:28:16,128
There's a nursing shortage,
and the pay is good.

505
00:28:16,128 --> 00:28:17,930
Full-time?

506
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:21,133
Thirty hours a week to start.

507
00:28:21,133 --> 00:28:23,102
How's that gonna work with the kids?

508
00:28:23,102 --> 00:28:26,238
I don't know, but we're gonna
have to figure it out...

509
00:28:26,238 --> 00:28:29,041
...because it's something I wanna do.

510
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,248
Danny, hi.

511
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:39,151
Sir.

512
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,821
I'm temping here till my appeal.

513
00:28:41,821 --> 00:28:43,355
How's that looking?

514
00:28:43,355 --> 00:28:45,825
My lawyer says not
to get my hopes up.

515
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:49,662
I'm thinking of adding a few
more bodies to the Barn.

516
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:53,566
I'd be filling the slots with
people who can get with my program.

517
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:56,502
What program's that?

518
00:28:56,502 --> 00:28:58,571
I need officers who I can trust.

519
00:28:58,571 --> 00:29:01,607
Play tough but fair. Keep me
aware of anyone who isn't.

520
00:29:01,607 --> 00:29:04,810
- You're looking for rats.
- No.

521
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:08,147
No, I don't want what happened
to you to happen to anyone else.

522
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,917
Just tell the truth if any
big lines get crossed.

523
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:15,154
- You mean by Vic.
- By anyone.

524
00:29:15,855 --> 00:29:17,189
You interested?

525
00:29:18,624 --> 00:29:20,493
You saying I can get my job back?

526
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:24,096
Think about it.

527
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,132
Give me your answer
when school gets out.

528
00:29:36,509 --> 00:29:38,110
What?

529
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,679
Word is you're a little
unsure of yourself out there.

530
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:46,118
- Is that what my partner's saying?
- What do you say?

531
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:48,120
I'm doing just fine.

532
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:52,791
Look, Julien, I'm not the
one riding you here.

533
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,895
But you got a little problem
with respect in this house.

534
00:29:55,895 --> 00:29:58,964
People are wondering what you're
doing about the beating you took.

535
00:30:01,901 --> 00:30:05,137
Look, detectives haven't
made much progress.

536
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:06,872
Still can't prove who did it.

537
00:30:06,872 --> 00:30:09,208
Everybody here knows who did it.

538
00:30:09,909 --> 00:30:11,510
And they're watching you.

539
00:30:15,447 --> 00:30:17,149
Where do we stand
with our triggerman?

540
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:19,752
We should have the
warrant within an hour.

541
00:30:19,752 --> 00:30:21,787
- Good.
- Somebody say warrant?

542
00:30:21,787 --> 00:30:23,822
Need me to knock any doors down?

543
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,329
Damn, I was gonna ask
her to the prom.

544
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,433
This warrant for that
Armenian double hit?

545
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:37,036
The mob's pissed about a
shitload of stolen money...

546
00:30:37,036 --> 00:30:39,038
...that was ticketed
for the homeland.

547
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:41,106
They're whacking the
players to find it.

548
00:30:41,106 --> 00:30:43,375
Armin was scared he
was gonna be next.

549
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:46,845
- Where's Armin now?
- Feds took him. Witness protection.

550
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:50,816
Good news is I finally got a
break on two unsolved murders...

551
00:30:50,816 --> 00:30:53,485
...that have been screwing
up my perfect record.

552
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:55,421
How's that?

553
00:30:55,421 --> 00:30:58,791
When this robbery went down,
two mob soldiers got killed.

554
00:30:58,791 --> 00:31:00,926
Three, four guys in
masks came roaring in.

555
00:31:00,926 --> 00:31:03,229
Took the cash, left the bodies.

556
00:31:03,896 --> 00:31:06,966
- Hey, man, what's up?
- Armin told Dutch that the guys...

557
00:31:06,966 --> 00:31:10,502
...who robbed the money train
killed those two Armenians.

558
00:31:10,502 --> 00:31:13,739
- Hey, we didn't kill no one.
- Why the hell would he tell him that?

559
00:31:13,739 --> 00:31:16,742
My guess, Armin knew those
guys were stealing from him.

560
00:31:17,977 --> 00:31:20,913
Armin's the one who called the
shooter down there that night.

561
00:31:21,614 --> 00:31:23,582
Scared enough to admit
money laundering...

562
00:31:23,582 --> 00:31:26,018
...but not enough to admit
to his part in a 1 87.

563
00:31:26,018 --> 00:31:29,488
So if the robbery leads back to us,
we're on the hook for a double murder?

564
00:31:32,658 --> 00:31:34,193
Jesus.

565
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,062
Here are the keys to the new space.

566
00:31:38,597 --> 00:31:41,700
With this new heat, we should
wait another six, nine months...

567
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,169
...before giving our cash
over to the real-estate guy.

568
00:31:44,169 --> 00:31:46,705
- Nine months? You're kidding me.
- We've been sitting on...

569
00:31:51,777 --> 00:31:54,647
I didn't mean to interrupt
your secret Klan meeting.

570
00:31:54,647 --> 00:31:56,715
We left our hoods at
the dry cleaners.

571
00:31:56,715 --> 00:31:57,816
Come on.

572
00:31:57,816 --> 00:32:00,419
Every time I enter the
room y'all stop talking.

573
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:03,455
Maybe it's because we're
captivated by your winning smile.

574
00:32:03,455 --> 00:32:07,726
- Yeah, or blinded by yours.
- Hey, you two done pissing?

575
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,063
Sit down. I'll tell
you what's going on.

576
00:32:14,733 --> 00:32:16,969
The Byz Lats just opened
fire on our turf.

577
00:32:16,969 --> 00:32:19,405
Aceveda doesn't have the
manpower to attack this...

578
00:32:19,405 --> 00:32:21,173
...and Kern's not playing nice.

579
00:32:21,173 --> 00:32:24,176
So we gotta do it
ourselves and do it fast.

580
00:32:24,176 --> 00:32:25,944
We're gonna tap Kern's phone.

581
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,080
Find out when this buy is going down.

582
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,416
- What, you'll tap without a warrant?
- No time.

583
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:32,017
Not enough hard evidence.

584
00:32:32,017 --> 00:32:34,486
You got a problem with
that, speak up now.

585
00:32:43,729 --> 00:32:48,267
Two weeks ago, 1 2 cases of MP5s
were stolen from Fort Irwin.

586
00:32:48,267 --> 00:32:52,237
Now, that's 72 guns on the
streets in the open market.

587
00:32:52,237 --> 00:32:54,440
And I already picked up one body.

588
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:57,242
I don't want anymore.

589
00:33:00,045 --> 00:33:01,747
Set up the tap on Kern.

590
00:33:08,687 --> 00:33:11,690
Hey, look, it's the Village People.

591
00:33:12,358 --> 00:33:13,692
<i>Stand by, Vic.</i>

592
00:33:13,692 --> 00:33:16,495
<i>- We're tapping.
- I don't believe you.</i>

593
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:20,466
<i>Jamir said all the skanks you hired
are light-skinned with fine bodies.</i>

594
00:33:20,466 --> 00:33:22,401
<i>- What's up with that?
- Jamir's half-white.</i>

595
00:33:22,401 --> 00:33:25,838
<i>- What do he know about fine bodies?
- I know you. Don't play...</i>

596
00:33:25,838 --> 00:33:28,507
Sounds like Kern's not too
big to be a little whipped.

597
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:30,843
Next thing, he'll be
buying her a new car.

598
00:33:30,843 --> 00:33:33,545
- I ain't jumping on nothing.
- Don't cut me off, xxxxx.

599
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:37,549
- Let me know when the call comes in.
- Where you going?

600
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:40,219
Corrine asked me to pick
up Cassidy at school.

601
00:33:40,219 --> 00:33:43,589
- Well, how long we staying here?
- Until the call comes in.

602
00:33:43,589 --> 00:33:46,191
The conversation will
probably be in code.

603
00:33:48,394 --> 00:33:52,164
Shit. I told Mara I'd
take her to lunch.

604
00:34:00,439 --> 00:34:03,442
Four different guns. We'll
run them through Ballistics.

605
00:34:03,442 --> 00:34:06,111
Look what the Dutch man found.

606
00:34:06,111 --> 00:34:08,947
He mailed an international
package to Greece this morning.

607
00:34:08,947 --> 00:34:12,718
- Look at the name of the recipient.
- "Marcus Dreliozis."

608
00:34:12,718 --> 00:34:14,987
Sound like a Greek alias
of Margos Dezirian?

609
00:34:14,987 --> 00:34:19,525
- Check out the comments section.
- "Contents contain dry ice."

610
00:34:19,525 --> 00:34:22,161
I think we found our missing feet.

611
00:34:24,096 --> 00:34:25,864
I'm sorry.

612
00:34:27,466 --> 00:34:29,001
Yeah, I'll try.

613
00:34:30,002 --> 00:34:33,972
All right, me too. Yeah, I
love you too. Okay, bye-bye.

614
00:34:36,175 --> 00:34:37,976
Blow me.

615
00:34:47,653 --> 00:34:49,922
Dude, we're rich.

616
00:34:49,922 --> 00:34:53,459
- At least we're gonna be.
- Yeah.

617
00:34:53,459 --> 00:34:57,262
- Just gotta ride things out.
- Yeah.

618
00:34:57,262 --> 00:35:01,200
<i>- Yo, yo. Let me talk to Kern.
- You got him.</i>

619
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,236
<i>It's Lex. Guns are ready.
Get all the cash yet?</i>

620
00:35:04,236 --> 00:35:06,338
<i>Yeah, man. I'm sitting on it.</i>

621
00:35:06,338 --> 00:35:09,842
<i>- Be there in half an hour.
- Right here.</i>

622
00:35:09,842 --> 00:35:12,077
I think I just broke the code.

623
00:35:16,149 --> 00:35:18,451
The gun boy just went inside.

624
00:35:18,451 --> 00:35:20,953
There were six crates
and four Army pals.

625
00:35:20,953 --> 00:35:23,289
- Four?
- Yeah.

626
00:35:23,289 --> 00:35:24,757
We need backup.

627
00:35:24,757 --> 00:35:27,493
Backup? Vic, we're here
on an illegal wiretap.

628
00:35:27,493 --> 00:35:29,529
Six-Paul-1 1 requesting
additional units...

629
00:35:29,529 --> 00:35:30,897
What are you doing?

630
00:35:32,832 --> 00:35:36,369
- I'm getting these guns back.
- Vic, we don't have a warrant.

631
00:35:36,369 --> 00:35:39,505
He's right. Maybe we should just
keep a low profile on this thing.

632
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:43,109
<i>Roger, 6-Paul-1 1.
What's your location?</i>

633
00:35:44,544 --> 00:35:46,412
Hey, it's five on five.

634
00:35:46,412 --> 00:35:49,715
You guys wanna go bullet-to-bullet
with three dozen SMGs?

635
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:53,419
I know what I'm doing.

636
00:35:53,419 --> 00:35:57,790
Six-Paul-1 1, we're at the corner
of Fletcher and Riverside.

637
00:35:57,790 --> 00:35:59,358
<i>Roger that.</i>

638
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,362
My client denies any
involvement in these killings.

639
00:36:03,362 --> 00:36:06,632
We've got an informant in the
organization that implicates him.

640
00:36:15,508 --> 00:36:19,579
This informant may have heard stories,
but he saw nothing with his own eyes.

641
00:36:23,182 --> 00:36:25,218
What'd he mail to
Athens this morning?

642
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:33,893
- Books.
- In dry ice?

643
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:40,633
- This isn't even his name on this.
- He just said he sent it.

644
00:36:40,633 --> 00:36:42,835
And the receipt was
found in his place.

645
00:36:42,835 --> 00:36:47,206
The only question is, why were you
stupid enough to keep the receipt?

646
00:36:47,206 --> 00:36:48,674
I'm not gonna ask him that.

647
00:36:48,674 --> 00:36:50,343
Okay.

648
00:36:50,343 --> 00:36:53,546
Why is he whispering? We don't
understand what he's saying anyway.

649
00:36:55,548 --> 00:36:58,451
Margos Dezirian is gonna
be at this address...

650
00:36:58,451 --> 00:37:00,253
...in Greece tomorrow, isn't he?

651
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:12,698
We're having the package
rerouted to us.

652
00:37:12,698 --> 00:37:14,700
We'll see for ourselves.

653
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:28,648
Four of you, that way.

654
00:37:29,849 --> 00:37:33,586
Go in the back. Take your cue from
those guys. Don't get in the way.

655
00:37:47,066 --> 00:37:49,869
- Hands on your head!
- Hands on your head now!

656
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:54,807
Get on the ground!

657
00:37:54,807 --> 00:37:56,542
Rabbit! Rabbit! Rabbit!

658
00:37:56,542 --> 00:38:00,279
- Get your ass down, don't move.
- He ducked into a backroom.

659
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:02,548
- Don't twist my arm like that.
- Don't move.

660
00:38:02,548 --> 00:38:06,285
- Kern, where's that lead to?
- Nowhere. The window's barred.

661
00:38:08,788 --> 00:38:10,456
Hook these people up.

662
00:38:10,456 --> 00:38:12,959
- Hook them up and get them out.
- Turn that off.

663
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:15,161
- Put your hands behind your back.
- Grab a gun.

664
00:38:15,161 --> 00:38:17,730
Move, move, move it around.
Move it around.

665
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:20,032
- Get them out. Get them out.
- Yeah, I got them.

666
00:38:20,032 --> 00:38:21,367
- Let's go.
- All right.

667
00:38:21,367 --> 00:38:23,903
- Load them.
- Come on.

668
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:27,506
- Hey, man, I'm all...
- You inside.

669
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:32,645
It's your 800 rounds a
minute versus our 4000.

670
00:38:32,645 --> 00:38:36,682
I'll give you three seconds to toss
that weapon or we're gonna open fire.

671
00:38:37,883 --> 00:38:39,352
One...

672
00:38:40,019 --> 00:38:41,654
...two...

673
00:38:43,856 --> 00:38:44,957
Come on out.

674
00:38:45,858 --> 00:38:47,994
These are the serial
numbers of the bills.

675
00:38:47,994 --> 00:38:50,629
If they get spent, make their
way through the system,...

676
00:38:50,629 --> 00:38:51,964
...they'll get flagged.

677
00:38:51,964 --> 00:38:53,599
Maybe we can flag them earlier.

678
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,035
Money was stolen here.
It'll be spent here.

679
00:38:56,035 --> 00:38:59,238
We should do cursory checks
on all big money busts.

680
00:38:59,238 --> 00:39:01,173
Any luck siccing the
authorities on Margos?

681
00:39:01,173 --> 00:39:02,375
Not yet.

682
00:39:02,375 --> 00:39:05,111
I talked to somebody at
the American embassy.

683
00:39:05,111 --> 00:39:06,312
Greek authorities
aren't gonna move...

684
00:39:06,312 --> 00:39:09,248
...unless they hear from
somebody higher up.

685
00:39:09,248 --> 00:39:11,851
You have connections in Washington?

686
00:39:11,851 --> 00:39:13,486
I've been to a few parties.

687
00:39:23,696 --> 00:39:25,264
I'm going, I'm going.

688
00:39:25,264 --> 00:39:28,734
Taking guns from our soldiers,
selling them to gangbangers?

689
00:39:28,734 --> 00:39:31,337
You must be very proud, asshole.

690
00:39:31,337 --> 00:39:34,106
God bless America.

691
00:39:34,106 --> 00:39:36,842
- Come here.
- Hey, we got it, man.

692
00:39:38,611 --> 00:39:40,212
Hey, Vic.

693
00:39:43,249 --> 00:39:46,385
You tell me. Who bought the
guns for the Byz Lats?

694
00:39:46,385 --> 00:39:50,322
Yeah, like I'm just gonna admit
I sold guns to another crew.

695
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,395
Uncuff him.

696
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:02,368
What are you doing?

697
00:40:02,368 --> 00:40:04,236
Instant court-martial.

698
00:40:06,338 --> 00:40:11,110
The trained soldier grabbed my
spare gun and tried to run for it.

699
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:13,179
Guys.

700
00:40:13,179 --> 00:40:15,748
Evidence. Right around there.

701
00:40:15,748 --> 00:40:18,651
You either tell me who bought
the guns for the Byz Lats...

702
00:40:18,651 --> 00:40:21,687
...or you and me are gonna
play some run and gun.

703
00:40:21,687 --> 00:40:24,256
- Yeah.
- Then run.

704
00:40:25,257 --> 00:40:27,226
You're out of your goddamn mind.

705
00:40:27,226 --> 00:40:28,694
Run.

706
00:40:32,164 --> 00:40:35,000
An OG named Garza.

707
00:40:37,503 --> 00:40:39,138
He's king of the Lats.

708
00:40:40,873 --> 00:40:43,242
That's a good little soldier boy.

709
00:40:44,176 --> 00:40:46,812
You want Treasury's list or
you want me to hang on to it?

710
00:40:46,812 --> 00:40:48,314
I'll keep it.

711
00:40:49,915 --> 00:40:51,350
I saw you talking to Vic.

712
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:54,720
- Has he been asking about this case?
- I was asking him questions.

713
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,856
He has experience with
Armenian organized crime.

714
00:40:56,856 --> 00:40:59,658
From here on, keep
him out of the loop.

715
00:41:01,227 --> 00:41:02,928
Okay. Why?

716
00:41:02,928 --> 00:41:06,732
- Because that's the way I'd like it.
- Detective, you've got a package.

717
00:41:23,582 --> 00:41:25,684
Size 10 and a half.

718
00:41:29,588 --> 00:41:31,323
Hold on.

719
00:41:31,323 --> 00:41:33,425
Kern and his guys
were in on the sting.

720
00:41:33,425 --> 00:41:36,162
They set it up. That's why
we didn't need a warrant.

721
00:41:36,162 --> 00:41:39,265
That's right. Little always ready
to help his brothers in blue.

722
00:41:39,265 --> 00:41:41,367
Give him to me, Julien.

723
00:41:41,367 --> 00:41:42,835
Come on.

724
00:41:49,808 --> 00:41:52,144
What the hell was that?

725
00:41:52,144 --> 00:41:54,713
I thought you'd be a bit
more appreciative...

726
00:41:54,713 --> 00:41:57,950
...since I just saved you
from a felony arms arrest.

727
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:01,020
- Call us even.
- Nothing's even.

728
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,655
One of your guys ain't dead.

729
00:42:02,655 --> 00:42:05,925
Look, we gonna get different gats,
go see the Mexicans. It's on.

730
00:42:05,925 --> 00:42:07,660
It's off.

731
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:09,795
My next stop is the Mexicans.

732
00:42:09,795 --> 00:42:11,096
You have my word.

733
00:42:11,096 --> 00:42:12,898
Yeah, well, I used to trust that.

734
00:42:12,898 --> 00:42:15,734
You still can. Just give
me tonight to prove it.

735
00:42:17,102 --> 00:42:18,804
You got tonight.

736
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:22,408
Y'all have a nice day.

737
00:42:22,408 --> 00:42:23,809
What?

738
00:42:23,809 --> 00:42:26,845
- Thought we were playing it tight.
- We are.

739
00:42:26,845 --> 00:42:29,515
You put us all at risk without
letting us have a say.

740
00:42:29,515 --> 00:42:31,617
Over guns we got nothing to do with.

741
00:42:31,617 --> 00:42:33,452
And I'd do it again.

742
00:42:33,452 --> 00:42:35,421
Well, I wouldn't.

743
00:42:35,421 --> 00:42:36,889
I wouldn't.

744
00:42:43,663 --> 00:42:45,932
I talked to my boss in D.C.

745
00:42:45,932 --> 00:42:47,934
Here's the problem.

746
00:42:47,934 --> 00:42:49,869
The Greeks don't wanna help us.

747
00:42:49,869 --> 00:42:52,071
- They're a little pissed off.
- Why?

748
00:42:52,071 --> 00:42:54,073
Because we make up reasons
for going to war.

749
00:42:54,073 --> 00:42:57,476
- Act like the world's policeman.
- And missiles we sold to Turkey.

750
00:42:57,476 --> 00:42:59,579
We're not the only
ones who want Margos.

751
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:01,547
Paraguay, Chile, Belgium...

752
00:43:01,547 --> 00:43:03,783
It's not Brussels
asking to conduct this.

753
00:43:03,783 --> 00:43:06,786
In a couple days we can go
through back channels...

754
00:43:07,587 --> 00:43:11,023
We know where Margos
is gonna be tomorrow.

755
00:43:11,023 --> 00:43:12,859
It's already tomorrow in Athens.

756
00:43:12,859 --> 00:43:15,628
I just need a few
officers to pick him up.

757
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:20,132
He's wanted for murder
in four countries.

758
00:43:20,132 --> 00:43:22,535
Can you get Lyor to tell
you where Margos is going?

759
00:43:22,535 --> 00:43:24,437
No.

760
00:43:24,437 --> 00:43:26,239
He's not talking.

761
00:43:27,073 --> 00:43:29,308
Even in prison you need feet.

762
00:43:30,543 --> 00:43:32,879
I'm sorry. I've done
everything I can.

763
00:43:33,646 --> 00:43:35,548
Assistant Chief Phillips?

764
00:43:35,548 --> 00:43:37,250
Claudette Wyms.

765
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:38,951
I remember, detective.

766
00:43:38,951 --> 00:43:40,219
What's going on?

767
00:43:40,219 --> 00:43:42,755
I think you should talk
to Captain Aceveda.

768
00:43:42,755 --> 00:43:44,290
Why?

769
00:43:45,925 --> 00:43:48,394
He's not stepping down yet, is he?

770
00:43:48,394 --> 00:43:50,129
You should go talk to him.

771
00:43:54,066 --> 00:43:56,569
I'm supposed to be
captain in two days.

772
00:43:56,569 --> 00:43:58,037
I still have some
unfinished business.

773
00:43:58,037 --> 00:43:59,171
How long?

774
00:43:59,171 --> 00:44:01,340
- Until I take office.
- Six months?

775
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:03,209
It's a volatile time in Farmington.

776
00:44:03,209 --> 00:44:05,411
I can't leave the Barn understaffed.

777
00:44:05,411 --> 00:44:07,246
You're gonna bring in personnel?

778
00:44:07,246 --> 00:44:10,516
- Yes.
- The undercover Decoy Squad?

779
00:44:10,516 --> 00:44:12,184
- Yes.
- You're stealing my ideas.

780
00:44:12,184 --> 00:44:14,353
I'm implementing them
along with my own.

781
00:44:14,353 --> 00:44:17,523
You are stealing my ideas,
and you're taking my job...

782
00:44:17,523 --> 00:44:20,693
- ...and padding your rÃ©sumÃ©!
- I can still make a difference here.

783
00:44:29,368 --> 00:44:31,804
- I can make a difference.
- Not like me.

784
00:44:32,705 --> 00:44:34,273
This is my job.

785
00:44:34,273 --> 00:44:35,808
Not yet.

786
00:44:37,777 --> 00:44:41,147
You're the reason for half the
problems in the first place.

787
00:44:41,147 --> 00:44:44,951
Well, that's your opinion. And
I'd keep any others to myself.

788
00:44:44,951 --> 00:44:47,853
I will not let you do this to me.

789
00:44:50,122 --> 00:44:53,292
There's a bigger picture.
You're smart enough to see it.

790
00:44:53,826 --> 00:44:56,128
The chief's not gonna help you.

791
00:44:56,128 --> 00:44:58,164
He's gonna need me.

792
00:45:07,974 --> 00:45:10,376
Army scab who sold the
Byz Lats their guns...

793
00:45:10,376 --> 00:45:12,912
...says the buyer's name was Garza.

794
00:45:12,912 --> 00:45:15,147
Garza? Thought he retired.

795
00:45:15,147 --> 00:45:18,884
Well, maybe his pension ran
out, because he's back.

796
00:45:18,884 --> 00:45:21,320
I need you to get in touch with him.

797
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:24,056
Tell him that you found a buyer...

798
00:45:24,056 --> 00:45:27,293
...offering to pay
double what he paid.

799
00:45:27,293 --> 00:45:28,728
That's all I got.

800
00:45:28,728 --> 00:45:30,796
I'll cover you on the back end.

801
00:45:30,796 --> 00:45:34,433
Hey, man, top's down pretty tight on
the Byzantine quarter these days.

802
00:45:34,433 --> 00:45:36,569
That's at least a couple days' work.

803
00:45:37,136 --> 00:45:38,904
You got two hours.

804
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:53,919
- Danny?
- No, no. I'll hold.

805
00:45:53,919 --> 00:45:55,721
You got the guns?

806
00:45:55,721 --> 00:45:58,591
Half of them. The Byz Lats
already have the other half.

807
00:45:58,591 --> 00:46:02,128
I'm trying to put together a buy
while they're all in the same hands.

808
00:46:02,128 --> 00:46:04,096
- I need some cash.
- How much?

809
00:46:04,096 --> 00:46:05,898
- A hundred grand.
- Right.

810
00:46:05,898 --> 00:46:09,368
Just to show them that we're real.
I just need it for a couple hours.

811
00:46:09,368 --> 00:46:12,438
- Then put in a request with Central.
- I need it now. Tonight.

812
00:46:12,438 --> 00:46:14,240
I'm not bending the rules for you.

813
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,242
Hey, look, I didn't
even want this case.

814
00:46:16,242 --> 00:46:18,077
Then why did you take it on?

815
00:46:18,077 --> 00:46:19,879
I'm the only one who gives a shit...

816
00:46:19,879 --> 00:46:21,947
...about the damage these
guns are gonna do.

817
00:46:21,947 --> 00:46:24,617
You're not. I've spent all
day calling in favors...

818
00:46:24,617 --> 00:46:28,387
...to make sure things change in
Farmington in the next six months.

819
00:46:28,387 --> 00:46:29,622
What's that mean?

820
00:46:29,622 --> 00:46:31,490
You have to file the
proper paperwork...

821
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:33,993
...and wait a couple of
days for the hundred grand.

822
00:46:34,794 --> 00:46:36,595
Or you can stop by an ATM.

823
00:46:46,338 --> 00:46:48,240
The guy's wanted by Interpol.

824
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,911
I'm giving you the address. All
you have to do is pick him up.

825
00:46:51,911 --> 00:46:55,114
What's so goddamn hard about that?

826
00:46:55,114 --> 00:46:57,016
If my tone sounds superior...

827
00:46:57,016 --> 00:46:59,919
...it's because I'm American
and you're Greek.

828
00:47:02,421 --> 00:47:04,290
Trouble in Armenia?

829
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:05,758
Athens, actually.

830
00:47:06,592 --> 00:47:08,294
What's going on?

831
00:47:10,496 --> 00:47:13,833
Nothing. It's just
the usual bullshit.

832
00:47:19,472 --> 00:47:21,107
Whom shall I fear?

833
00:47:22,775 --> 00:47:26,345
You are the stronghold of my life.

834
00:47:28,114 --> 00:47:29,982
Whom should l...?

835
00:47:32,518 --> 00:47:34,386
Jesus Christ.

836
00:47:35,387 --> 00:47:38,557
- What are you doing here?
- Confess...

837
00:47:38,557 --> 00:47:41,927
- ...to what you did to me.
- What?

838
00:47:41,927 --> 00:47:43,896
I just need to know.

839
00:47:44,897 --> 00:47:46,665
Look, I just...

840
00:47:48,033 --> 00:47:49,768
I just need to know.

841
00:47:50,903 --> 00:47:52,705
What the hell's your problem, man?

842
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:57,510
The truth... Just tell me the truth.

843
00:47:58,377 --> 00:48:00,579
I didn't do anything to you.

844
00:48:02,982 --> 00:48:04,116
Shit!

845
00:48:04,116 --> 00:48:05,851
Say it!

846
00:48:05,851 --> 00:48:09,288
Shit. God.

847
00:48:09,288 --> 00:48:12,958
Though an army besiege me,
my heart will not fear.

848
00:48:12,958 --> 00:48:15,761
Even though war breaks out
against me, even then...

849
00:48:15,761 --> 00:48:17,396
Julien, please!

850
00:48:29,041 --> 00:48:30,509
God.
