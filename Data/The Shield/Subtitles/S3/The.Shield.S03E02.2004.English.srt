1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,535
<i>Previously on "The Shield".</i>

2
00:00:02,535 --> 00:00:04,571
I'm supposed to be
captain in two days.

3
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:06,005
I still have some
unfinished business.

4
00:00:06,005 --> 00:00:07,841
You are stealing my ideas,...

5
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:09,876
...and you're taking my job...

6
00:00:09,876 --> 00:00:12,545
- ...and padding your résumé!
- I can still make a difference here.

7
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:15,014
- This is my job.
- Not yet.

8
00:00:15,014 --> 00:00:17,817
They killed these Armenians
looking for our money-train cash.

9
00:00:17,817 --> 00:00:20,253
There's four people who
know we took that money.

10
00:00:20,253 --> 00:00:22,756
They're all sitting right here.
Stick to the plan.

11
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:25,125
Low profile. Business as usual.

12
00:00:25,725 --> 00:00:27,794
- Hi, guys.
- We in your way?

13
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:30,196
- No, we're just...
- We're just finishing up.

14
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:33,867
Just needed to ask a
question and sneak a kiss.

15
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,503
Known this girl for two months,
you're buying a new car?

16
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:38,671
- It's preowned.
- Nice try.

17
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:39,906
No sale, you got it?

18
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:41,641
Why'd you say you'd help me?

19
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:43,209
- This is so embarrassing.
- I'm sorry.

20
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:46,579
I need to make a living. Would you
buy a half-million-dollar home...

21
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:48,148
...from somebody driving a '97 Neon?

22
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:51,584
The Byz Lats arming themselves
to the mother-tit with MP5s.

23
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:53,653
Well, the Byz Lats got their guns.

24
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:54,888
I'll disarm the Mexicans.

25
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,891
- Yeah, well, I used to trust that.
- Just give me tonight to prove it.

26
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:04,230
Who bought the guns for the Byz Lats?

27
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,533
An OG named Garza.

28
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:07,967
You got the guns?

29
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:10,804
Half of them. The Byz Lats
already have the other half.

30
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:13,573
I'm trying to put together a buy
while they're all in the same hands.

31
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,442
- I need some cash.
- How much?

32
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:17,177
- A hundred grand.
- Right.

33
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:18,578
Just to show them that we're real.

34
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,180
You have to file the
proper paperwork...

35
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,881
...and wait a couple of
days for the hundred grand.

36
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:23,349
Or you can stop by an ATM.

37
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:32,792
Jesus, between your
snoring and the phone...

38
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:39,265
- Yeah.
- Rise and shine, gorgeous.

39
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,100
- Time to go to work.
- Where are you?

40
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,969
About five feet from your door.

41
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,144
I guess we're up.

42
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:54,614
Hey, man.

43
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:59,819
Set up a meet with the Byz Lats. We're
getting those guns back tonight.

44
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:03,556
- Should I make some coffee?
- No. No time. Thanks, anyway.

45
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:05,058
I was asking him.

46
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:08,595
Don't worry about it. Go back to
sleep. I'll be home in a few hours.

47
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,032
Grab your gun, leave the badge.

48
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:15,535
We're not cops tonight.

49
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:17,337
We're neo-Nazis.

50
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:21,574
- Bye, baby.
- Bye.

51
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:23,476
- Ready?
- Yeah.

52
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,984
I see someone parked a new
Lexus in your parking spot.

53
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,386
Mara needed it for work,
and it's pre-owned.

54
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:37,056
And I told you not to buy it for her.
We're gonna talk about this later.

55
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:42,629
This Garza guy's just gonna
give us his guns? Why?

56
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:45,565
It's called commerce. Here,
you carry the money.

57
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:50,003
- Holy shit.
- Army-issue MP5s don't come cheap.

58
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,572
Aceveda signed off
on a wad like this?

59
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:57,110
Not exactly. Look, I didn't have time
to go through the proper channels.

60
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,113
- This is from our Money Train stash?
- For display purposes only.

61
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:01,848
Then it goes right back
where it came from.

62
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,484
I told Kern I'd get the guns back.

63
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:06,819
It's gonna make our
jobs easier and safer.

64
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:10,456
So you dipped into our life savings
to keep a promise to some scumbag?

65
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:16,029
Aceveda wouldn't sign off on time so
we're gonna do this off the books.

66
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:19,365
We won't even get credit for taking
these goddamn guns off the street.

67
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,334
We're gonna talk about
this later too.

68
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:22,468
Yeah.

69
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:29,809
You Garza?

70
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:36,983
You have a shipment of MP5s.

71
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:39,152
They belong to our organization.

72
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:40,587
Which is?

73
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:42,589
The Sword of the Creator.

74
00:03:43,222 --> 00:03:45,892
If the gats are yours,
how come I got them?

75
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,227
We put down a deposit.

76
00:03:48,227 --> 00:03:50,330
The dealer got nervous
and dumped them.

77
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,333
Half to your crew, other
half to the niggers.

78
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:59,238
Only the niggers got busted, which
leaves my eses with all the firepower.

79
00:03:59,238 --> 00:04:02,909
Look, it's not your fault
our deal went sideways.

80
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,178
Which is why we're willing
to compensate you...

81
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:07,313
...rather than taking them from you.

82
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:10,650
Trust me, doing business with us
is preferable to doing battle.

83
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,752
We're still gonna need
somebody to mow our lawns...

84
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,520
...once this race war's over with.

85
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:27,400
Whatever you shelled out for
those guns, I'll pay double.

86
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,303
Look, you got two choices.

87
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:32,939
Either you put some
money in your pocket...

88
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,541
...or Elwood here dimes you the ATF.

89
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,777
I got a brother-in-law over there.

90
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,546
Ever have the feds crawl
up your ass before?

91
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,316
Half the money up front.

92
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:45,451
Then give me half the guns up front.

93
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:48,621
- Meet me in an hour.
- I pick the place.

94
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,790
And I want all 36 weapons.

95
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:01,000
Get him. I'll clear the car.

96
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,669
Let me see your hands.

97
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:04,604
Let me see your hands.

98
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:15,314
You hurt?

99
00:05:17,316 --> 00:05:18,785
He's dead.

100
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:23,656
One-Tango-4. Code 6. 1949, Coronado.

101
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:27,493
Two victims down. Request three units
and a supervisor for a crime scene.

102
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:31,931
<i>- You guys set?
</i>- We're good to go.

103
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:33,232
We got a four-runner.

104
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:35,902
Driver and a passenger.
Extra muscle in the back.

105
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:37,804
Two. They're strapped.

106
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:40,239
How'd I know this guy
was gonna bone us?

107
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,974
<i>I got the guy in the hat.</i>

108
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:43,943
<i>All right, Fat boy's mine.</i>

109
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:45,445
<i>Any sign of the guns?</i>

110
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:46,679
<i>Yeah.</i>

111
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:49,382
Okay, well, hang tight,
we're 10 minutes out.

112
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:50,883
Damn.

113
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:52,819
How many rounds went off here?

114
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,520
Multiple shooters?

115
00:05:57,457 --> 00:06:00,026
- Who's that guy?
- Passenger in the back seat.

116
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,694
Bawling his eyes out
when we got here.

117
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:02,895
Hey.

118
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:05,965
Found this in the alley back there.

119
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:11,337
You don't need more than one
shooter if you're packing that.

120
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:26,753
Tell the two assholes
to drop their guns...

121
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:29,355
...and come out with their
hands where I can see them.

122
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:31,157
You been watching me, homes?

123
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:38,831
Actually, we gonna need the money and
the guns to help with our expansion.

124
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:45,171
Don't do something
goddamn stupid here.

125
00:06:56,983 --> 00:07:00,119
Tell them to let him
go right now, asshole!

126
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:07,460
I lived five years longer
than I ever thought I would.

127
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:11,497
The vatos I came up with
in the game, they gone.

128
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:14,667
Go ahead, shoot. Make me a hero.

129
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:17,870
But Byz Lats are walking
away with that cash.

130
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:20,506
Your guy so much as twitches...

131
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:23,176
...my guy's gonna put one
in the back of your skull.

132
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,046
- Shoot the prick.
- No. Don't.

133
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:34,220
Ronnie, put it down.

134
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:37,723
Him first.

135
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:42,562
Ronnie, go on.

136
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:14,227
Mow your own lawns, putas.

137
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,414
Rough night?

138
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:37,183
Hey.

139
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:40,386
Sometimes mommy just won't nut
no matter how hard you hit it.

140
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,488
Shut up.

141
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:46,025
All right, here's the plan.

142
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,061
We're gonna set up
Garza in a drug sting.

143
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:51,931
Use the takedown to leverage
the guns off the Byz Lats.

144
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:54,734
- Who's Garza?
- Their soon-to-be ex-leader.

145
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:56,936
You get with your contacts.
I'll get with mine.

146
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:59,572
Let's find out who's dealing
quantity to this crew.

147
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:01,641
They're getting skunk
out of Humboldt.

148
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:03,576
I wanna get Garza on the hard stuff.

149
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,845
Tougher prison sentences
on the asshole.

150
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:08,347
You chase the rock, I'll find
out where he's getting H.

151
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:09,482
All right.

152
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,156
What about our goddamn money?

153
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:19,091
Our priorities are
guns off the street...

154
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:21,694
...and Garza rotting in jail,
knowing we put him there.

155
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:24,397
Our priorities? I don't
remember being consulted.

156
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,999
It's my fault for letting
a guy get behind me.

157
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:28,768
You never should've
been in that situation.

158
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,002
Shane's right.

159
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:34,273
What happened last night was an
error in judgment on my part.

160
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:37,443
We were out of position, outmanned.
It won't happen again.

161
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:40,179
In the meantime, we'll never
see that 100 grand again.

162
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:41,280
Yeah, that's on me too.

163
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,483
So stop whining and take
the money out of my share.

164
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:45,818
- Deal.
- No.

165
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:49,221
It's the cost of doing business, all
right? We should all take the hit.

166
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:50,990
Shane needs the dough.

167
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,458
He tell you...

168
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:56,462
...he bought the new squeeze a
sweet new ride? Against my orders?

169
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,665
On this job, you're the boss.

170
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:03,069
But when it comes to the Money
Train deal, we are partners.

171
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:04,737
I can live my life just fine.

172
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:08,274
Go ahead and live it. Count
your money and wash your Lexus.

173
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,710
We can get Garza and
the guns on our own.

174
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:22,355
News is the Byz Lats jacked
some white dudes buying guns.

175
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:25,591
-One bald head, one dirty crackerwood.
-Save it.

176
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:27,026
Three Byz Lats went down wet.

177
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:29,562
One of them's not getting
up on account of your guys.

178
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:31,764
I can't control every
dog in the pound.

179
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:35,201
They see the Byz Lats strapped
with goddamn MP5s. I mean, shit.

180
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:38,037
Your hollow points seem to be
getting the job done all right.

181
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:41,674
That was tooth for a tooth. My boys
gonna do desperate shit, they got to.

182
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,943
Talk about capping
Byz Lats kids next.

183
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:45,311
Well, you got to stop them.

184
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,948
Man, I can steer the ship,
but I can't turn it around.

185
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:50,649
I'm gonna get the MP5s.

186
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:52,885
And I'm gonna get this
Garza asshole good.

187
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:54,020
Ticktock.

188
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:57,023
I'm just here to let you know it's
about to jump off. Real spit.

189
00:10:57,023 --> 00:11:00,459
Well, I'm here to tell you, any
more One-Niner drive-bys...

190
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,528
...I'm holding you
personally responsible.

191
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:08,467
The mayor's office and
tell them I need...

192
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:11,270
Chief Bankston, I've had trouble
getting you on the phone.

193
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:14,106
That's because I've been
ducking your calls, detective.

194
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,744
Am I wrong or was I not
offered the captain's job?

195
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:20,579
That was when the job was open.

196
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:23,416
Captain Aceveda has a plan for
cleaning up Farmington...

197
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:27,253
- ...and he wants to see it through.
- Yes, I know all about his plans.

198
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:31,724
If the promotion in Farmington doesn't
happen, put me someplace else.

199
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:34,026
Your value's at the Barn.

200
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:37,163
Besides, I don't have any
positions open anywhere else.

201
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:38,764
Be patient.

202
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:42,868
So you're telling me that a chief has
been outpoliticked by a captain?

203
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:52,011
When Aceveda takes office, do
I have your word I move up?

204
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:56,282
You have my support.

205
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:02,988
But you might try playing a little
politics yourself with him.

206
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,731
I thought you were working.

207
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:18,003
I got into something with Vic.

208
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:21,674
- You want me to make you a sandwich?
- No, I'm not hungry.

209
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:27,980
- What's the problem?
- Not important.

210
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,183
Well, it must be for you to
be all torqued up like this.

211
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:37,189
It's about me. Me and
this goddamn car.

212
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:38,724
Why does he even care?

213
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:40,626
It's not that.

214
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:43,796
Look, we can return the car.

215
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:46,165
I need it for work, but we
can figure something out.

216
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:47,766
No, we're keeping the car.

217
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,469
This thing between me and Vic...

218
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,906
...it's complicated, you know?

219
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,175
Sometimes brothers fight.

220
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,449
So why is he always making
you the little brother?

221
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,519
That's not how it is.

222
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:15,361
Dutch. Aceveda said you had
some questions for me?

223
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,630
Your missing guns.
They're MP5s, right?

224
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,099
- Yeah.
- It was an MP5 used in our shooting.

225
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:22,902
- Who were the vics?
- Two Latino bangers.

226
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:24,470
Sound like One-Niners?

227
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,438
No, we disarmed them.

228
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:28,774
- What's the neighbourhood?
- Coronado.

229
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:32,144
No, that's Byz Lats territory.
Don't worry. I'm on it.

230
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,380
Anything on Garza's cane slanger?

231
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:39,051
Got a description of a cat
driving a blue 740 on Lexanis.

232
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:41,053
Those rims alone, 2 grand a pop.

233
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:42,721
What'd the DMV kick out?

234
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,658
Got six of those
registered in Farmington.

235
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,026
Plate numbers.

236
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:50,563
Alonzo Wang.

237
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:54,233
My guy did say that the Byz Lats
heroin supplier is a black Asian.

238
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:56,702
So their heroin dealer's
also their crack dealer.

239
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:59,338
Makes it easy. Get me an address.

240
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:03,742
Everyone all right?

241
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:06,145
Yeah, fine. I just got
my new work schedule.

242
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:08,681
- And I thought we could go over it.
- Not now.

243
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:13,085
Okay. Know what? Take a look at it,
call me at home or the hospital then.

244
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:14,486
Which hospital?

245
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:16,488
I'm back at Mission Cross.

246
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:19,592
What, in the ER? That's
becoming a war zone down there.

247
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:23,295
- We respond to brawls twice a month.
- They have a high turnover rate.

248
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:27,566
That's how Heather was able to pull
some strings, get me my old job back.

249
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:29,635
You get two night shifts a week.

250
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:31,470
You hiring a nanny nights too?

251
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,973
- I thought you would take the kids.
- I can't...

252
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:36,242
I thought you wanted to
spend more time with them.

253
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:38,477
- I do, but...
- I spent 11 years...

254
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:41,080
...working around your schedule, Vic.

255
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,283
Divorce means occasionally
working around mine.

256
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:46,418
Hi, Corrine. Nice to see you.

257
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:48,254
Nice to see you too.

258
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:51,190
I gotta go. Call if
you have questions.

259
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,726
Thanks for this. I'll work it out.

260
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,628
Getting back together?

261
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:58,030
Not exactly.

262
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,499
Look, I got a tip.

263
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:03,102
Could put the Byz Lats'
supplier out of business.

264
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:04,837
- Yeah?
- I need a warrant.

265
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:06,505
How good's the probable cause?

266
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:10,142
- My Cl's got a stellar track record.
- I'll see what I can do.

267
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:12,611
This is time sensitive. How
long for the paperwork?

268
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:14,313
Depends how solid your paperwork is.

269
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:17,283
We could use this to pry something
loose on Dutch boy's case.

270
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:19,785
I got it, Vic. There's
a system in place.

271
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:23,055
Feed your warrant request through it.
Anything else?

272
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:24,490
Not at the moment.

273
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:28,961
Raymond Montes. He was the passenger?

274
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:31,130
Arrested a month ago for possession.

275
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,632
And this Calva guy.

276
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:37,036
Narcotics convictions, assault.
I can't even count the DUIs.

277
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:40,706
You, on the other hand,
graduated cum laude...

278
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:44,343
...National Merit winner... Me too.
Wasn't easy, was it?

279
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:47,479
So, what were you doing
with these two losers?

280
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:49,548
Raymond wasn't a loser.

281
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:51,250
He was my friend.

282
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:56,422
Since high school. He found out
these guys were beating on me...

283
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:57,923
...stealing my stuff.

284
00:15:57,923 --> 00:15:59,892
High school can be hell.

285
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:01,026
Yeah.

286
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:05,364
Raymond made sure everybody
knew that if anybody hurt me...

287
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,434
...they'd get it back worse.

288
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,436
A guardian angel...

289
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:12,938
...with a rap sheet six pages long?

290
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,840
I don't know.

291
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,609
He just did what he did.

292
00:16:20,979 --> 00:16:22,548
And now he's gone.

293
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:27,986
Sorry about your boyfriend.

294
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,457
Raymond's friends say you're
making threats against Garza.

295
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:33,525
You think he shot Raymond and Calva?

296
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,529
Come on.

297
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:38,897
Juan Pepe.

298
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,335
What's the question?

299
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:46,004
Calva was a Torruco, right?

300
00:16:46,004 --> 00:16:50,309
So, what, Garza thought Raymond was
a traitor for hanging out with him?

301
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:52,511
You got the 411, why you sweating me?

302
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:55,114
All we're trying to do is catch
the killer of your boyfriend.

303
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:02,955
Garza marked Calva's ass for leaving
the Lats and joining the Torrucos.

304
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,924
What was Raymond doing with Calva?

305
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:08,127
Warning him.

306
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:11,597
Trying to get him to
come back to the crew.

307
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:15,567
Garza saw that as talking
with the enemy, retaliated.

308
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:19,338
You better get that puta before I do.

309
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:21,407
We'll certainly do our best.

310
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,778
- Where the hell is Tavon?
- He'll get here when he gets here.

311
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:28,814
If we hadn't gotten him involved,
we'd pop this asshole.

312
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:30,115
Use him to get our money back.

313
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:32,084
I'm trying to put this
prick Garza away.

314
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:35,687
I need a legal, solid case against
this guy to get him to cooperate.

315
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:39,324
If Aceveda's got so much juice, how
come he can't get us a warrant...

316
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:41,393
...while I'm still in my 30s?

317
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,928
He's on the move.

318
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:44,062
Damn it.

319
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:48,500
He's going back inside.

320
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,036
- Come on.
- Here's Tavon, let's go.

321
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:54,573
- We got the warrant.
- About time.

322
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,042
Don't blame me. Judge
had a Pilates class.

323
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:16,094
Can I help you?

324
00:18:16,094 --> 00:18:19,398
Not only can you, you're going to.

325
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,669
Have a seat.

326
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:27,873
Clear!

327
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,075
Clear.

328
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:40,819
Check this out. My God.

329
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:42,187
Hey, boss.

330
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,470
I hope you got something for
a headache, because I'm it.

331
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,739
It's a regular Rite
Aid in here, Lonzo.

332
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:03,342
My lawyer's gonna read this warrant.

333
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:06,979
If there is even an
apostrophe missing...

334
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:11,783
You roll the dice on a 20-year
stretch. See how good we spell check.

335
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:14,119
Or you could get your ass
on the phone with Garza.

336
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:18,357
Tell him you got shipments of H and
coke you're selling at discounts.

337
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:25,264
Garza's late.

338
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:28,433
Yeah, our boy here says
he's never on time.

339
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,171
How long you gonna keep
Shane on the bench for?

340
00:19:33,171 --> 00:19:34,673
He'll come back when he's ready.

341
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:41,146
<i>Tavon, tell your girlfriend
</i>to stop looking so nervous.

342
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:42,514
<i>Relax, man.</i>

343
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:50,989
Here we go. Game time.

344
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,526
That's our bag from last
night with our money.

345
00:19:57,396 --> 00:20:00,098
Shit. That's not our guy.
It's not our guy.

346
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:02,601
It's Diagur, one of his lieutenants.

347
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:05,571
How are we gonna bust Garza
if he's not doing the deal?

348
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:08,407
Give him the drugs. You'll get
the money from him later.

349
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:09,641
- What?
<i>- Just do it.</i>

350
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:11,677
- What the hell...?
- Let this guy skate.

351
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:14,746
We take him down for the money
later on without Tavon around.

352
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,685
<i>Tell him that your place
</i>is under surveillance.

353
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:20,752
Hey.

354
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:24,189
Mind holding onto that for
a little while longer?

355
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:27,826
We got some heat on the crib.
Safer that way.

356
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:29,227
Right.

357
00:20:29,227 --> 00:20:32,531
Besides, it's not like we
don't trust you folks.

358
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:36,635
All right. No problem.

359
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:38,270
Later, dog.

360
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,610
Yo. What the hell was that?

361
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,979
You're letting him leave with
the drugs and the money?

362
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:52,150
Vic? Vic.

363
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,688
I told you going to the
chief wouldn't help.

364
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:02,694
For the last 10 years,
Farmington has been the place...

365
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:07,032
...people come to buy their drugs,
sex, fence their stolen goods.

366
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:08,800
I wanna clean it up.

367
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,569
Spare me. I'm not one of your voters.

368
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:12,838
You had two years to clean it up.

369
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:15,273
And I'm finally in the
position to do it.

370
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:18,410
Anything else?

371
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:24,483
I need someone overseeing the
practical elements of my plan.

372
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:25,884
Your plan?

373
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:29,955
You would have command
over the Strike Team...

374
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,723
...and the new Decoy Squad.

375
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:35,127
- Think of it as a promotion.
- I had a promotion.

376
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,296
You took it away, remember?

377
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:47,839
Hands on the wheel!
Hands on the wheel now!

378
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:49,341
Get them up here.

379
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:56,148
- You again? What's your problem?
- I'm on a dope hunt.

380
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:59,017
Why don't you pop the trunk,
see if I bagged something?

381
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,954
- Damn.
- Where's Garza?

382
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:07,926
Garza, you're only 27, already CEO
of one of the biggest gangs in town.

383
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,328
You've taught yourself...

384
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:13,065
...what guys spend years in
business school trying to learn:

385
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:15,200
Leading men. Maximizing profits.

386
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:19,171
I decide to take the Lats
public, I'll let you know.

387
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:24,042
Let's talk about where you were
last night, midnight to 1.

388
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:28,547
Candi's Lounge. I got a VIP table.

389
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:31,016
Well, you're a very important person.

390
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:34,319
You like trim? Because
I can get you in.

391
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:38,857
Is that all?

392
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:41,259
Man, because I'm missing
an appointment.

393
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:43,161
Yeah. Relax.

394
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:47,232
The wheels of industry can turn
without you for a couple of hours.

395
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:58,177
You gonna take the fall for
your boss on these drugs?

396
00:22:58,177 --> 00:22:59,612
That's exactly what's gonna happen...

397
00:22:59,612 --> 00:23:01,447
...unless you tell me
where these guns are.

398
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:05,584
Man, I don't know nothing
about no drugs or no guns.

399
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:07,786
Come on, man, where do we find Garza?

400
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:08,954
No clue.

401
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:11,624
Look, I got nothing
against you personally.

402
00:23:11,624 --> 00:23:14,226
But I had a beautiful plan
to take down Garza...

403
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,562
...and you stumbled right in my way.

404
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:19,164
How come we're not conversating
in a real cop house?

405
00:23:20,366 --> 00:23:23,102
I take you in, you're in the system.

406
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:25,204
I lose control of the situation.

407
00:23:25,204 --> 00:23:28,140
What happens to you gets decided
by some guy in a suit...

408
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,776
...who doesn't understand
how valuable you can be.

409
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:33,679
I'll never be valuable to you.

410
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,447
Sure you are.

411
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,284
You just need some convincing.

412
00:23:39,285 --> 00:23:42,821
Esteban. We've got a
suspect in the shooting.

413
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:44,957
I need you to look at this lineup.

414
00:23:44,957 --> 00:23:46,492
Take your time.

415
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,604
I told you. I didn't see anyone.

416
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:01,407
Sometimes, you think you
didn't see anything...

417
00:24:01,407 --> 00:24:04,910
...then you see a face and
it all comes back to you.

418
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:07,813
No.

419
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:11,717
This group of guys in
my middle school...

420
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:14,653
...hated my guts.

421
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:17,890
Every day, they'd think
up something worse to do.

422
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,958
They'd spray-paint my locker...

423
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,928
...steal my homework, charge
me 10 bucks to get it back.

424
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:24,697
That was in the Midwest.

425
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:28,701
I can only imagine what
things are like here.

426
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:30,302
So I understand.

427
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,538
You gotta be pretty scared.

428
00:24:32,538 --> 00:24:34,640
No one in this lineup
can see you, son.

429
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:37,676
I know you wanna do this.

430
00:24:39,545 --> 00:24:40,913
For Raymond.

431
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:46,685
I didn't hear anything...

432
00:24:47,353 --> 00:24:48,887
...I didn't see anything.

433
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,357
Okay.

434
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:53,726
We'll get there.

435
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:58,097
- He saw Garza do the shooting.
- Yep.

436
00:24:58,097 --> 00:25:00,065
Kids growing up in this cesspool.

437
00:25:01,467 --> 00:25:03,936
Finally meet one that's
on his way out...

438
00:25:03,936 --> 00:25:07,239
...and he ends up in the back of
a banger car covered in blood.

439
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:12,578
You gotta ask yourself,
what's the point?

440
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:37,703
You okay?

441
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:40,806
Let me see your hands!

442
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:47,346
Don't fight us.

443
00:25:47,346 --> 00:25:49,782
Give me your hands.

444
00:25:54,753 --> 00:25:56,555
Sorry for the interruption.

445
00:26:05,197 --> 00:26:08,233
- What the hell's he doing here?
- He's Kern. We like him.

446
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,737
Kern, meet the new
leader of the Byz Lats.

447
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:14,706
What are you talking about?
Garza's mi jefe.

448
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:16,208
Garza's out of a job.

449
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:17,743
He just doesn't know it yet.

450
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:20,579
I'm grooming you.

451
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:23,916
So you two are gonna draw some lines
and we're all gonna leave here happy.

452
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:28,387
You having a chronic moment, homes.
I ain't trucing with no spook.

453
00:26:28,387 --> 00:26:30,589
Hold up. This taco boy
didn't call me no spook.

454
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,758
There's no need to go racial here.

455
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:33,859
No one wants to settle this...

456
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:36,595
...in a locked steel container
with our bare hands.

457
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:37,930
Right, Kern?

458
00:26:38,831 --> 00:26:42,000
You two start talking this out. I'll
check on you in a couple hours.

459
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,305
Lem, you stay here.

460
00:26:56,482 --> 00:26:57,783
Glad you're back.

461
00:26:57,783 --> 00:26:59,718
You're the boss.

462
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:01,887
But my personal life stays personal.

463
00:27:13,499 --> 00:27:16,235
You wanna tell me what that
little dance was about?

464
00:27:16,235 --> 00:27:18,136
The dealer we were
supposed to take down...

465
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:21,740
...waltzes with the drugs,
money, and a stroll?

466
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,675
He's agreed to cooperate.

467
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:26,378
Now we're gonna set up Garza
and get those guns back.

468
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:29,448
I had to snag a goddamn
ride here with our snitch.

469
00:27:29,448 --> 00:27:33,051
Lucky for you he drives a
Beemer with $2000 rims.

470
00:27:38,557 --> 00:27:39,958
What are you doing?

471
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:43,395
Figuring out how much I've got
in savings and partial pension.

472
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:45,330
See if you can afford to quit.

473
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:48,300
- You're too young to quit.
- And I'm too old for this.

474
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:51,703
Aceveda's just trying to shore
up his cop credentials.

475
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:55,040
Couple of months, the numbers will
turn around, the job will be yours.

476
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,175
- I wish I had your faith.
- Hey.

477
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,579
You're the best cop
I've ever worked with.

478
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,748
Well, thank you.

479
00:28:02,748 --> 00:28:05,584
Nobody else ever came close
to keeping up with me.

480
00:28:05,584 --> 00:28:07,452
- Hold that thought.
- Do I have to?

481
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:08,554
Question, Vic.

482
00:28:08,554 --> 00:28:11,156
Make it snappy, I'm
drowning in something.

483
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:14,359
Suspect in our shooting heads
up the Byz Lats. Name's Garza.

484
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,228
Wondered if you guys
have a profile on him.

485
00:28:16,228 --> 00:28:19,231
Garza? That's the asshole
who's got our guns.

486
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:22,601
- We've been looking for him all day.
- I just cut him loose.

487
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:24,303
- He was here?
- Kid wouldn't ID him.

488
00:28:24,303 --> 00:28:27,105
I know he did it. I need to
prove his alibi's bullshit.

489
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:29,074
Says he was at Candi's Lounge.

490
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:31,243
Yeah. Yeah, I may have
heard of that place.

491
00:28:31,243 --> 00:28:32,678
Just happens to be on your way home?

492
00:28:32,678 --> 00:28:34,846
Hey, we're all about the job.

493
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:38,550
Dutch, Crime Reconstruction called.
They're ready for us.

494
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,952
Thanks.

495
00:28:39,952 --> 00:28:41,653
Garza goes down for
a murder charge...

496
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:44,656
...we won't have to prop up a shaky
drug bust with our own cash.

497
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:47,559
It goes back into its
hole, no questions asked.

498
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,429
Let's go knock down
this asshole's alibi.

499
00:28:56,335 --> 00:28:59,605
You seeing what I'm seeing?
Literally rained bullets.

500
00:29:00,372 --> 00:29:02,407
And not just into the front seat.

501
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:06,478
Okay, let's lose the art projects.

502
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:07,946
Are you kidding?

503
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:09,948
You know how many hours
I've been at this?

504
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:12,484
Take your pictures,
then tear it down.

505
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:14,219
First crime scene, son?

506
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:21,793
Hey.

507
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:23,929
Garza's alibi checks out.

508
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:27,666
He was at that club doing body shots
off some stripper named Poundcake.

509
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:30,969
- Titties for everybody.
- I didn't need to hear that.

510
00:29:32,037 --> 00:29:35,040
Hey, Vic, that warrant check out?
The Byz Lats supplier?

511
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,242
Not a goddamn thing.

512
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:41,346
- I thought your intel was solid.
- The dealer's house was clear.

513
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:43,281
I had to pull Judge Davies
out of Pilates class...

514
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,017
...to expedite that warrant.

515
00:29:45,017 --> 00:29:48,453
We're trying to connect Garza.
He's not the triggerman.

516
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,389
We know.

517
00:29:50,389 --> 00:29:51,490
He is.

518
00:29:58,597 --> 00:29:59,865
Sorry about this.

519
00:29:59,865 --> 00:30:03,068
I gotta do this
witness-statement thing.

520
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:04,836
It's procedure.

521
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:07,239
No problem.

522
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,276
I talked to administration
at UC Santa Barbara.

523
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:13,912
They said you didn't
reenrol for next semester.

524
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:15,714
Move back to L.A.?

525
00:30:15,714 --> 00:30:17,349
Hang out?

526
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:18,717
I guess.

527
00:30:20,052 --> 00:30:23,155
<i>- What are you planning on doing?
</i>- How's it going?

528
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:26,525
Still at the friendly chat stage.
Dutch might go on all day.

529
00:30:26,525 --> 00:30:29,628
<i>- Applied anywhere?
</i>- No. Not yet.

530
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:32,064
Is this gonna take much longer?

531
00:30:32,064 --> 00:30:34,633
I'm sorry. Get up, walk around.

532
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:37,335
I know this room can feel
a little claustrophobic.

533
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,907
Come on. Would you just scare the
crap out of this shit already?

534
00:30:41,907 --> 00:30:44,609
Think you can scare him
as much as Garza does?

535
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:47,112
- Actually, yeah.
- Let Dutch do his thing.

536
00:30:47,112 --> 00:30:50,882
<i>Okay, I know you
</i>didn't see anything...

537
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:53,185
<i>...the night that Raymond
</i>and Calva were killed.

538
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:54,853
You sure you didn't hear anything?

539
00:30:56,455 --> 00:30:57,556
No.

540
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:00,425
I told you. The music was
just bumping too loud.

541
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:02,327
- I couldn't hear any...
- Right.

542
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:05,897
- So how'd you hear the shots?
- What?

543
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:07,799
You must've heard the
first couple of shots...

544
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:10,235
...and hit the floor
pretty damn fast.

545
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:12,738
Otherwise, we're not
having this conversation.

546
00:31:12,738 --> 00:31:15,006
Okay. Here we go.

547
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:17,242
<i>You look at the crime-scene
</i>reconstruction...

548
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:19,745
...it's amazing the
bullets missed you.

549
00:31:19,745 --> 00:31:21,646
I mean, I know you're skinny, but...

550
00:31:23,849 --> 00:31:25,484
Why am I even in this room?

551
00:31:27,686 --> 00:31:29,387
You know why you're in this room.

552
00:31:30,756 --> 00:31:33,725
- Think I had something to do with it?
- You did.

553
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:37,362
- Why would I kill my best friend?
- My partner and I did a little test.

554
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:40,999
From where the shooter was standing,
you can't see the passenger's seat.

555
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:43,869
- You only meant to kill Calva.
- I didn't even know Calva.

556
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:47,372
You wanted to come back to L.A.,
hang with Raymond, make money.

557
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:49,674
Best way to do that was
to join the Byz Lats.

558
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:51,676
Raymond wouldn't even let me join.

559
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:53,879
Which is why you went
behind his back.

560
00:31:53,879 --> 00:31:57,449
Asked Garza to jump you in. Taking
out Calva was your initiation.

561
00:31:57,449 --> 00:31:59,484
- No.
- You did the shooting.

562
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:01,853
You went down to the car
and you saw Raymond.

563
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:03,822
<i>You know why he was
</i>there, by the way?

564
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:07,159
<i>He wanted to give Calva one
</i>last chance to come back.

565
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:09,027
<i>He didn't wanna see any bloodshed.</i>

566
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:10,695
You were right about Raymond.

567
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:13,298
For a banger, he turned
out to be a good guy.

568
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:17,402
I didn't mean to do it.

569
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,243
- Who gave you the gun?
- It was an accident.

570
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:27,179
The gun that killed your best friend.

571
00:32:28,814 --> 00:32:30,148
<i>Garza did.</i>

572
00:32:35,387 --> 00:32:38,190
<i>Can you help me? Please?</i>

573
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:40,959
Not anymore.

574
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:53,705
It's still Esteban's
word against Garza's.

575
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:55,774
To convict we're gonna
need corroboration.

576
00:32:55,774 --> 00:32:58,577
Well, I'm Mr. Corroboration.

577
00:33:00,946 --> 00:33:02,381
Don't ask.

578
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:07,019
So how goes the peace process?

579
00:33:07,019 --> 00:33:10,489
Middle East'll be a love-in before
these idiots sort their shit out.

580
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:11,590
What's the roadblock?

581
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:14,059
This fool ain't
offering me dxxx, man.

582
00:33:14,059 --> 00:33:15,961
He ain't got nothing to deal.

583
00:33:16,862 --> 00:33:18,263
We're the ones strapped.

584
00:33:18,897 --> 00:33:20,732
See what I mean?

585
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:21,900
Hey.

586
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:27,906
I'm getting the feeling you're not
appreciating the promotion I gave you.

587
00:33:27,906 --> 00:33:30,976
It doesn't matter to what I agree.
Garza calls the shots.

588
00:33:30,976 --> 00:33:32,478
Garza's going to jail.

589
00:33:32,478 --> 00:33:35,047
He's got his own guys
killing each other.

590
00:33:35,047 --> 00:33:37,950
You ain't got nothing on him.
He already punked you once.

591
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:41,220
How smart was it sending a
19-year-old bookworm to do the hit?

592
00:33:42,287 --> 00:33:44,189
A college boy gave him up.

593
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:46,758
You can't tell me
Garza's a business man.

594
00:33:47,226 --> 00:33:49,761
I got his money, his drugs
and his top lieutenant.

595
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:52,464
You tell me one thing your
boss hasn't screwed up.

596
00:33:52,464 --> 00:33:56,134
Your choices are climbing up the
ladder or going down the drain.

597
00:33:59,471 --> 00:34:01,607
- lf the vato know I spun him...
- Who's gonna know?

598
00:34:01,607 --> 00:34:03,208
This is between you and me.

599
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:06,645
I just need proof he ordered
the hit on this Calva guy...

600
00:34:06,645 --> 00:34:10,582
...and the throne and the
crown are all yours.

601
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:19,191
Look, all I know is he
gave Esteban a gun...

602
00:34:19,191 --> 00:34:22,895
...the address, and he printed
out a map how to get there.

603
00:34:22,895 --> 00:34:24,229
That's all I know.

604
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,499
Good. Let's finish this thing.

605
00:34:29,301 --> 00:34:31,803
- Knock it off! Now!
- Sir.

606
00:34:33,205 --> 00:34:34,406
Sir.

607
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:38,076
- My appeal was at 11.
- Can you give us a minute?

608
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,078
- Where were you?
- It's been hectic.

609
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:43,148
Right. You promised that
you would be there for me.

610
00:34:43,148 --> 00:34:45,984
Look, the vote's gonna be
2 to 1 in your favour.

611
00:34:45,984 --> 00:34:47,986
I put in a call this morning.
It's a done deal.

612
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:50,923
I got my job back?

613
00:34:50,923 --> 00:34:53,025
You'll get official word tomorrow.

614
00:34:55,294 --> 00:34:57,296
- Thanks.
- You got it.

615
00:34:57,296 --> 00:34:59,064
But I am really busy here, okay?

616
00:34:59,064 --> 00:35:00,799
Okay. Sorry.

617
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,935
Thanks.

618
00:35:04,636 --> 00:35:07,606
- Scared the hell out of him.
- What was I supposed to do?

619
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:09,374
You're in church on
Monday afternoon,...

620
00:35:09,374 --> 00:35:11,310
...your life could use
a little excitement.

621
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:14,046
Guess what? They're bringing me back.

622
00:35:15,147 --> 00:35:17,649
Really? Congratulations.

623
00:35:17,649 --> 00:35:20,218
- That's great.
- They upheld your appeal? Wow.

624
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:22,621
Whose desk you have to bend over?

625
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:25,023
Sure as hell wasn't yours.

626
00:35:25,023 --> 00:35:26,825
A guy can dream, can't he?

627
00:35:26,825 --> 00:35:28,360
How's he working out?

628
00:35:29,595 --> 00:35:31,930
- Doing good.
- Made a few arrests.

629
00:35:33,365 --> 00:35:36,234
I thought I'd give you the news.
I'll talk to you later.

630
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:37,436
All right.

631
00:35:43,709 --> 00:35:46,511
You better make sure your
people deliver on this truce.

632
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:48,080
- And if I don't?
- Hey.

633
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:51,316
You owe me. I'm keeping the
One-Niners from being wiped out.

634
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:54,519
We'll see. I mean, you got Garza,
but you still ain't got the guns.

635
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:57,089
No, but I'm smelling them.

636
00:36:13,238 --> 00:36:16,208
Baseball cap's our
signal Garza's inside.

637
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:20,045
- Gave up his buddy?
- What separates them from us.

638
00:36:20,045 --> 00:36:23,682
Loyalty, that most
disposable of virtues.

639
00:36:39,097 --> 00:36:42,434
- Where's Garza?
- I got him. I got him. Don't move.

640
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:51,143
Hey!

641
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:53,345
He's going out the back.

642
00:36:57,816 --> 00:36:58,984
Hurry up.

643
00:36:58,984 --> 00:37:02,821
You have about two seconds to
tell me where the guns are.

644
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:05,390
Suck me hard, bitch.

645
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:06,625
We got him.

646
00:37:08,794 --> 00:37:09,861
Hey.

647
00:37:11,363 --> 00:37:13,632
Managed to stop him
before he got away.

648
00:37:20,706 --> 00:37:22,708
Hey, captain, what's up?

649
00:37:22,708 --> 00:37:25,777
The pastor from the church
lodged a complaint against you.

650
00:37:26,278 --> 00:37:28,013
- Jesus.
- What's he saying?

651
00:37:28,013 --> 00:37:29,681
Excessive force.

652
00:37:29,681 --> 00:37:33,485
That's crap. The guy was
tweaking, he wouldn't go down.

653
00:37:33,485 --> 00:37:35,253
Took four of us to
get him in the cage.

654
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,222
Tommy, give us a minute, please.

655
00:37:37,222 --> 00:37:39,958
- Come on, captain.
- Tommy, please.

656
00:37:47,966 --> 00:37:51,670
Fortunately, the pastor's a friend, so
I think the complaint will go away.

657
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,538
I just wanna make sure
you're all right.

658
00:37:53,538 --> 00:37:54,706
Sir?

659
00:37:55,507 --> 00:37:58,143
How would you characterize
the incident?

660
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:03,014
The amount of force was
necessary to affect the arrest.

661
00:38:05,851 --> 00:38:07,486
And everything's okay with you?

662
00:38:07,486 --> 00:38:10,122
Yes, sir. Everything's great.

663
00:38:19,698 --> 00:38:21,867
Even if we don't get
him on the homicide...

664
00:38:21,867 --> 00:38:24,569
...this should put him away
for a couple of decades.

665
00:38:24,569 --> 00:38:27,339
Call me greedy, I still want
him for the murder-for-hire.

666
00:38:27,339 --> 00:38:29,307
- Me too.
- Hey, Dutch boy.

667
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,009
Might wanna grab this
prick's computer.

668
00:38:31,009 --> 00:38:34,412
See if there's anything
that ties him to Esteban.

669
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:36,681
Bag the laptop separately.

670
00:38:39,952 --> 00:38:41,620
Where's my phone call?

671
00:38:42,054 --> 00:38:43,889
We got your laptop.

672
00:38:43,889 --> 00:38:46,325
Downloaded records of
your online activity.

673
00:38:46,325 --> 00:38:48,127
The porn sites were illuminating.

674
00:38:48,127 --> 00:38:50,629
I liked the map you
printed out for Esteban:

675
00:38:50,629 --> 00:38:53,265
Directions from his house to Calva's.

676
00:38:53,265 --> 00:38:56,302
I talked to the DA. You turn
in the remaining 35 MP5s...

677
00:38:56,302 --> 00:38:58,637
...she's willing to take the
death penalty off the table.

678
00:39:00,606 --> 00:39:02,341
Put the needle right here.

679
00:39:02,341 --> 00:39:04,977
Show me where the goddamn phone is.

680
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,749
We'll get you a good
lawyer, all right?

681
00:39:12,518 --> 00:39:17,489
- The guns?
- Look man, word's out you got popped.

682
00:39:17,489 --> 00:39:20,025
Torrucos and One-Niners,
they coming at us hard.

683
00:39:22,294 --> 00:39:26,465
Yo, homey, where those cuates at?
So we can protect what's ours.

684
00:39:32,972 --> 00:39:36,976
Get a truck, pick up the guns.
Wait for my call.

685
00:39:36,976 --> 00:39:39,044
And put a few aside for emergencies.

686
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:41,480
How we gonna explain how
we got this artillery?

687
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,616
We can't, so we won't.

688
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:47,953
Put this with the rest of
the Money Train stash.

689
00:39:47,953 --> 00:39:49,888
It's 20 grand light.

690
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:51,857
Byz Lats' overhead, I guess.

691
00:39:51,857 --> 00:39:53,559
Better than losing the whole hundred.

692
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:55,594
The way I figure it.

693
00:39:55,594 --> 00:39:58,163
I guess everything worked out okay?

694
00:39:58,163 --> 00:39:59,498
Got lucky.

695
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:02,501
So we cool?

696
00:40:04,003 --> 00:40:05,237
Of course.

697
00:40:10,242 --> 00:40:12,278
You got the Decoy Squad for sure?

698
00:40:12,278 --> 00:40:15,381
They start next week.
Supposed to be great.

699
00:40:15,381 --> 00:40:17,850
How'd you get Griggs to give them up?

700
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:19,318
He hasn't yet.

701
00:40:19,318 --> 00:40:22,688
He's gonna call Councilman
Docknovitch to get me to back off.

702
00:40:22,688 --> 00:40:25,257
Not knowing Docknovitch is
gonna need my support...

703
00:40:25,257 --> 00:40:26,825
...on his zoning application.

704
00:40:26,825 --> 00:40:29,261
Which you'll be only
too happy to give.

705
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:34,099
I think we need a series
of high-profile busts...

706
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:37,836
...using the Decoy Squad
to flush them out...

707
00:40:37,836 --> 00:40:40,072
...and the Strike
Team to step on them.

708
00:40:40,072 --> 00:40:43,575
In a very public way, you change
perception, you change reality.

709
00:40:43,575 --> 00:40:46,211
Does this mean I can
welcome you aboard?

710
00:40:46,211 --> 00:40:48,380
Anything I can do to help.

711
00:40:48,881 --> 00:40:51,350
Shall I give Vic the good
news or do you want to?

712
00:41:03,095 --> 00:41:05,130
- Shane's not home.
- I know.

713
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:09,234
I wanted to apologize for
barging in on you last night.

714
00:41:09,234 --> 00:41:11,203
- No big deal.
- Look...

715
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:13,872
...you and I got off
on the wrong foot.

716
00:41:13,872 --> 00:41:15,874
We should really get
to know each other.

717
00:41:15,874 --> 00:41:17,743
- Why's that?
- Well...

718
00:41:17,743 --> 00:41:20,312
...you're becoming a big
part of Shane's life.

719
00:41:20,312 --> 00:41:22,514
Which makes you a
member of the family.

720
00:41:22,514 --> 00:41:26,251
Never really been big on family.
Or cops really.

721
00:41:26,251 --> 00:41:28,654
Shane's the exception.

722
00:41:28,654 --> 00:41:31,557
Look, I'm just trying to find
a way for us to get along.

723
00:41:33,258 --> 00:41:36,729
And I've seen that same smile
on about two dozen guys...

724
00:41:36,729 --> 00:41:39,164
...who thought a wink and
a $3 gin and tonic...

725
00:41:39,164 --> 00:41:41,600
...was all that it would take
to get me into bed with them.

726
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:46,939
I do something to piss you off?

727
00:41:46,939 --> 00:41:50,008
I don't like the way you treat Shane.
But that's his problem.

728
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:52,711
You don't understand the world
that Shane and I live in.

729
00:41:53,746 --> 00:41:56,582
Shane works for you, but
he comes home to me.

730
00:41:56,582 --> 00:41:59,351
- You've known him for two months.
- I know enough.

731
00:41:59,351 --> 00:42:01,520
I'm not sure what your problem is.

732
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,422
Maybe because you couldn't
hold on to your family...

733
00:42:03,422 --> 00:42:05,758
...you're scared Shane's all you got.

734
00:42:05,758 --> 00:42:08,127
- Excuse me?
- Whatever the reason...

735
00:42:08,127 --> 00:42:11,897
...I got enough bullshit seeping into
my life without inviting yours in.

736
00:42:11,897 --> 00:42:14,533
So please, don't pop in
if Shane's not here.

737
00:42:20,139 --> 00:42:21,640
What?

738
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,943
I called Treasury to see if any of
these marked bills have shown up yet.

739
00:42:24,943 --> 00:42:26,412
- And?
- No.

740
00:42:26,412 --> 00:42:29,782
Whoever's got them is sitting on them
or spending them someplace safe.

741
00:42:29,782 --> 00:42:33,652
I wouldn't sweat it. No one steals
money to sit on it their whole lives.

742
00:42:38,257 --> 00:42:39,758
Sorry about that.

743
00:42:40,826 --> 00:42:44,229
- Why?
- I know you had a connection.

744
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:46,131
Just when I thought he was a victim.

745
00:42:46,131 --> 00:42:48,300
The minute I found out
he was a shooter...

746
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,968
...just another loser.

747
00:42:51,703 --> 00:42:55,040
So you sticking around?

748
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,543
Can't retire on cat food.

749
00:42:57,543 --> 00:43:00,846
Yeah, you'll never leave me.

750
00:43:10,189 --> 00:43:13,158
Hey. Need some help?

751
00:43:13,158 --> 00:43:14,660
No, I got it.

752
00:43:16,195 --> 00:43:19,398
I was thinking, if we both talk
to Aceveda about teaming up...

753
00:43:19,398 --> 00:43:20,933
...he might put us back together.

754
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,268
What?

755
00:43:24,036 --> 00:43:27,439
You were my training officer,
but I'm not a rookie anymore.

756
00:43:27,439 --> 00:43:31,877
Actually, I've been bumped back to P2.
So officially we're equals.

757
00:43:31,877 --> 00:43:33,312
That's how it'd be.

758
00:43:36,415 --> 00:43:37,716
Maybe.

759
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:41,687
But I like the way
things are for now.

760
00:43:41,687 --> 00:43:42,988
Okay.

761
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:46,658
Glad things are working out for you.

762
00:43:50,162 --> 00:43:52,831
I need to meet with you and your
guys in the briefing room...

763
00:43:52,831 --> 00:43:54,800
...next Tuesday, 3:00.

764
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,035
Sure. What's up?

765
00:43:57,035 --> 00:43:59,838
David's bringing in the
Decoy Squad from Wilshire.

766
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:01,473
They're gonna be working with you.

767
00:44:04,576 --> 00:44:06,111
Great.

768
00:44:06,111 --> 00:44:08,714
I'm gonna be in charge of both teams.

769
00:44:08,714 --> 00:44:10,883
I'll fill you in on the
details on Tuesday.

770
00:44:11,817 --> 00:44:13,151
Three o'clock.

771
00:44:17,823 --> 00:44:20,092
- Just spoke to Claudette.
- Good.

772
00:44:20,092 --> 00:44:22,027
Sounds like an
interesting experiment.

773
00:44:22,027 --> 00:44:23,862
It's more than an experiment, Vic.

774
00:44:23,862 --> 00:44:26,298
It's your assignment for
the foreseeable future.

775
00:44:26,298 --> 00:44:28,367
I thought Claudette
was taking your job.

776
00:44:28,367 --> 00:44:31,103
You'll have to stomach
me for a little longer.

777
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:34,439
How much longer? Just so
I can warn my stomach.

778
00:44:34,439 --> 00:44:36,942
Maybe working under Claudette
will produce results.

779
00:44:36,942 --> 00:44:39,511
I've been producing results.

780
00:44:39,511 --> 00:44:43,215
Not today. You had a drug
warrant blow up in your face...

781
00:44:43,215 --> 00:44:45,584
...Dutch and Claudette
beat you to a gang bust...

782
00:44:45,584 --> 00:44:47,953
...those Army rifles you've
been so hell-bent...

783
00:44:47,953 --> 00:44:49,521
...to get are still on the streets.

784
00:44:49,521 --> 00:44:51,323
Doesn't seem like your finest hour.

785
00:44:52,591 --> 00:44:54,059
I guess not.

786
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:26,491
All right, let me throw one in.

787
00:45:37,336 --> 00:45:38,904
Bon voyage.
