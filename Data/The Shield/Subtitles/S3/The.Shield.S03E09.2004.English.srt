1
00:00:00,834 --> 00:00:02,202
<i>Previously on "The Shield".</i>

2
00:00:02,202 --> 00:00:04,271
If there's a mole, it's not
Claudette's fault that you got made.

3
00:00:04,271 --> 00:00:06,473
It is if she's submitting
wiretap requests for us.

4
00:00:06,473 --> 00:00:09,476
I don't Trish back in one
piece, I'll use every favor...

5
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:12,579
...I've banked for the last 14
years to get your lazy ass fired.

6
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:14,114
She belongs behind a desk.

7
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:15,549
Not messing with what
we do on the street.

8
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:18,151
She's been playing both of us
against each other from the jump.

9
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:19,620
Now, if we start playing
ball together...

10
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,622
She can't command if
we don't let her.

11
00:00:21,622 --> 00:00:23,924
Let's see that mouth. Suck it!

12
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,293
- And you couldn't stop them?
- He had a gun to my head.

13
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:27,828
Do you know who they are?

14
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:30,464
I could find out. But
even then, what?

15
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:32,499
If it was me, I'd kill them.

16
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:34,401
It's been really busy right now.

17
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:36,003
You're always busy.

18
00:00:36,003 --> 00:00:37,738
That's never stopped you
from coming home before.

19
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:39,539
- What's going on?
- There's money missing.

20
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:42,276
- We're missing 7000.
- Including some marked money.

21
00:00:42,276 --> 00:00:44,211
Ronnie reported the money missing.

22
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:45,946
Lem didn't even wanna steal
it in the first place.

23
00:00:45,946 --> 00:00:48,448
- I didn't take that money.
- You think there's any chance...

24
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:49,983
- ...Vic took that money?
- Shut the hell up.

25
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:52,853
Who's gonna steal seven grand
and leave a fortune behind?

26
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:07,334
<i>Wheelchair to Admitting.</i>

27
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:09,703
<i>Wheelchair to Admitting.</i>

28
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:11,939
I'm on. I'm on it.

29
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:15,976
- 5'7", short hair.
- Christ.

30
00:01:15,976 --> 00:01:19,579
- Are you okay?
- You didn't have to come.

31
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:22,749
- What happened?
- I was patching up this Asian guy...

32
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:26,253
...and I saw he had a
gunshot wound to the arm.

33
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:28,956
When I went to call it
in, he freaked out.

34
00:01:28,956 --> 00:01:30,223
Damn it.

35
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:32,659
You know, nothing's broken.
I'll be okay.

36
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:34,828
I got all the details.

37
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:37,264
- Any gang tats?
- No, just track marks.

38
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,866
He's either on something
or off his meds.

39
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:42,102
I told you this place was a zoo.

40
00:01:44,004 --> 00:01:45,706
Come on, I'll take you home.

41
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:47,975
I can get a ride.

42
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:50,444
No lectures, I promise.

43
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:01,922
- He's still working with Matt?
- Not now.

44
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:03,790
What happened?

45
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,593
I'm okay. Some guy just
went off at the hospital.

46
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:08,862
- Jesus.
- Calm down.

47
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:12,199
- Gonna get Matt worked up.
- He can handle big feelings.

48
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:14,501
- You an expert on my son now?
- Yes, I am.

49
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:16,403
- Vic.
- Mommy?

50
00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:22,542
Mommy had an accident. I'll be okay.
Cassidy, go get your homework out.

51
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:27,981
- I'll help you in a minute.
- I can handle things here.

52
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,050
Because you're an expert
on my whole family now.

53
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,385
No.

54
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:36,957
You should come down to the
Barn, look at the mug books.

55
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:40,227
Is that a good idea? I mean,
he knows where you work.

56
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:42,896
What's to stop him from
coming back and hurting you?

57
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:44,531
I'm what's stopping him.

58
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:46,600
She picks him out, I find him...

59
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,336
...make sure he knows going
back isn't an option.

60
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:53,840
It's not worth it. I mean,
just leave it alone.

61
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:58,879
You know I wouldn't ask you to do
this if I didn't think it was safe.

62
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,681
I'll call you. We'll figure it out.

63
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:04,651
Fine. You let me know.

64
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:13,160
- Sir, Aurora's on the phone.
- Tell her I'm in a meeting.

65
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,129
Are you? Because I don't
like lying to people.

66
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:18,331
I'm in a meeting.

67
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:20,167
Whatever you say.

68
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,307
We heard dudes fighting or something.

69
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:28,508
Yeah?

70
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:35,482
Saw the gate. Merril always locks it.

71
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:38,351
- You guys did good, calling us.
- Thanks.

72
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:41,621
Hey, hey, hey, wait here.
Wait here, all right?

73
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:49,629
- I'll go right.
- All right, I'll flank left.

74
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,000
No.

75
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,236
Danny!

76
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:43,017
There's a Merril Jindrich,
runs the community center...

77
00:04:43,017 --> 00:04:45,920
...says the name of the victim
is Klee Jones. Local kid.

78
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,588
- Banger?
- Kid had no ink.

79
00:04:47,588 --> 00:04:49,757
No gang tags anywhere.

80
00:04:49,757 --> 00:04:51,225
He painted this.

81
00:04:51,225 --> 00:04:53,827
He's got others around
the neighborhood.

82
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:55,563
It's beautiful stuff.

83
00:04:55,563 --> 00:04:57,431
I always wondered who the artist was.

84
00:04:57,431 --> 00:05:00,000
Maybe we could get the Strike
Team and the Decoy Squad...

85
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,769
...to help us run down leads.

86
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:03,904
We don't know if it's
gang- or drug-related.

87
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:06,106
And I wanna give Walon
some more cooling-off time.

88
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:08,409
Right now all we have is a homicide.

89
00:05:09,777 --> 00:05:11,845
This boy wasn't just murdered.

90
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:15,349
He was lynched. You better
know there's a difference.

91
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:20,788
I know. You two can handle it.

92
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:35,869
- How's the stomach?
- Doc's got me on scrips.

93
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:39,073
Listen. I can understand you
not wanting to say anything...

94
00:05:39,073 --> 00:05:41,308
...in front of the others.

95
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:42,876
But if you took our missing cash...

96
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:44,411
- Vic.
- For any reason...

97
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:46,547
...I promise we'll make it all right.

98
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:48,349
Look, I didn't take it.

99
00:05:50,451 --> 00:05:53,020
Okay, I just had to ask.

100
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,556
Well, you know what, man?
Ask someone else.

101
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:03,497
Where's your mom and dad?

102
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:04,932
Dead.

103
00:06:04,932 --> 00:06:08,068
Me and Klee pretty much
raised each other.

104
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:10,671
You know of anyone who would
wanna hurt your brother?

105
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,010
People barely notice him.
He's so quiet.

106
00:06:17,945 --> 00:06:20,948
- Everybody loved his paintings.
- We saw.

107
00:06:20,948 --> 00:06:22,716
They're amazing.

108
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:34,762
Ask Gitana.

109
00:06:34,762 --> 00:06:36,864
I bet she's got something
to do with this.

110
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:38,198
Who's that?

111
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:41,135
This Mexicali girl
Klee hooked up with.

112
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:45,939
Her ex-boyfriend, all his friends,
they're straight up gangsters.

113
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:48,042
Los Profetas.

114
00:06:50,878 --> 00:06:52,713
Klee was different.

115
00:06:52,713 --> 00:06:55,449
I mean, not all about
getting at my ass and tits.

116
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:57,317
I mean, we'd talk about stuff.

117
00:06:57,317 --> 00:07:00,487
Art, love, you know, life shit.

118
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:03,357
He made me realize, you know,
I could do better for myself.

119
00:07:03,357 --> 00:07:04,692
Better than Neron?

120
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:08,028
We understand your ex-boyfriend
was a member of Los Profetas.

121
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:12,132
- Neron's a Cristo boy.
- Didn't work out?

122
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:13,934
He wanted me to go to church.

123
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,769
Meanwhile, he's on
the street thugging.

124
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,729
Klee's sister thinks that
your gang affiliations...

125
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,840
...might have something
to do with his death.

126
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,777
A lot of the gangs was pissed about
him painting over their tags.

127
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:26,513
Maybe Neron got jealous,
you dating a black guy.

128
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:29,049
I'm fine...

129
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:31,118
...but I'm not killing-fine.

130
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:37,758
I gotta ask you something...

131
00:07:37,758 --> 00:07:39,393
I counted right the first time.

132
00:07:39,393 --> 00:07:42,563
I counted right the last time
and I didn't take the money.

133
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,365
Lem said you asked.

134
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:47,134
You ask Shane yet?

135
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:48,602
Sir.

136
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:51,805
I have Aurora.

137
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:55,776
No, I have her here.

138
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:09,356
Any leads on the lynching?

139
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:12,326
Claudette and Dutch are on it.

140
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:14,995
Anyone in custody?

141
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,764
Just witnesses. Why?

142
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:19,333
People are terrified.

143
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:22,236
The black leadership's convening
a rally at the Hope Center.

144
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:25,439
- You need to go.
- It's a crime scene, not a photo op.

145
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:27,407
This isn't for the cameras.

146
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:29,810
You've to tell them that you
have everyone protected.

147
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,345
You make it sound
like I'm checked out.

148
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:34,782
The last thing we need is for a
dark-horse black candidate...

149
00:08:34,782 --> 00:08:38,685
...to capitalize on this.
Run as an Independent.

150
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,888
Crazier things have
happened in this state.

151
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:42,523
Well, I'm not worried.

152
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:49,196
I've given you space to get
through whatever this is.

153
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:53,600
If you don't want to tell me what the
problem is, I'll find out another way.

154
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:58,972
Sir, you need to take this call.

155
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:05,412
We heard some of the
gangs were upset...

156
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:08,382
...because his murals
covered their tags.

157
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:11,552
He got some threats, talk mostly.

158
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:16,023
I think some of the gangs dug his
stuff. It just wasn't cool to say so.

159
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:20,661
Now what?

160
00:09:28,936 --> 00:09:31,038
Do I really wanna know?

161
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:40,581
Father Zavala. Stabbed five times.

162
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:44,251
Must have come out from the sacristy.
Wounds are to the back and neck.

163
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:46,153
Any witnesses?

164
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:49,423
- Just the calling card.
- One-Niner payback for Klee Jones.

165
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:52,326
- Klee wasn't a banger.
- This is bigger than gang beefs.

166
00:09:52,326 --> 00:09:54,995
He was a black boy
hanging from a tree.

167
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:57,698
The One-Niners think the Los
Profetas are responsible.

168
00:09:57,698 --> 00:10:00,300
Zavala was their spiritual counsel.

169
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,169
Bring in the Strike Team.

170
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:04,504
Track down the Decoy
Squad and use them too.

171
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:07,174
Now that we know it's gang related?

172
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:13,547
- Vic, we got trouble.
- What's up?

173
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:15,883
It's the money-train fed.

174
00:10:15,883 --> 00:10:18,085
He was asking me where
Aceveda and Dutch are.

175
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:19,820
- What's he want?
- Nothing we do.

176
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,022
Yeah, they told him to wait upstairs.

177
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:27,461
Detective, your team's
needed right away.

178
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:35,335
- Any inside info on Los Profetas?
- Killers with a conscience.

179
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:38,338
Got their piece of the street,
usually keep to themselves.

180
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:41,275
- It's biblical with these cats.
- Which means eye-for-an-eye time.

181
00:10:41,275 --> 00:10:43,844
You cover the priest. Dutch and I'll
stay with the hanging.

182
00:10:43,844 --> 00:10:46,513
Hey, look, in this hood, if
a black kid ends up dead...

183
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:49,016
...it's because a deal went
bad and someone's pissed off.

184
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,052
Guilty until proven white?

185
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:54,955
Yeah, maybe we should get
the ACLU to solve it.

186
00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:58,025
We'll look under our rocks,
you look under yours.

187
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:05,165
These guys can't hear
anything right now.

188
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,301
Let's check out the Niners first.

189
00:11:12,806 --> 00:11:16,710
You're getting some help. Well it's nothing.
Good decision. We definetely take care you guys.

190
00:11:16,777 --> 00:11:18,412
What's up, Tob?

191
00:11:18,412 --> 00:11:20,614
What's this, "Bring your
daddy to work" day?

192
00:11:20,614 --> 00:11:24,718
Community outreach.
Neighborhood's in mourning.

193
00:11:24,718 --> 00:11:26,820
I see that.

194
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,590
- Take the Shriners outside.
- All right, let's go, pops. Let's go.

195
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:33,460
Let's talk.

196
00:11:39,633 --> 00:11:41,468
Give up the booth, Twizzy.

197
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:53,080
- Where's Kern at?
- I think he's in Prague, touring.

198
00:11:54,614 --> 00:11:56,249
19 Playaz, huh?

199
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:59,753
- One-Niners funding that tour?
- We're creative partners.

200
00:11:59,753 --> 00:12:01,955
Kern's put a lot of
faith in you guys.

201
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:05,325
Bet he's gonna be pretty disappointed
when he finds out you knifed the priest.

202
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:07,728
Oh, You're gonna be disappointed
when you find out we didn't.

203
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:11,398
No? Then who wrote
"One-nine" across his face?

204
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,133
He was tagged, dude.

205
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,869
What kind of crew you running here, Tob?

206
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:18,772
One hand don't know who the
other hand's stabbing?

207
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:20,774
Look, if one of mine
did it, I'll find out.

208
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:22,709
Make sure you give
him a medal for it.

209
00:12:24,144 --> 00:12:28,081
Look, man. People loved that kid's murals,
all right. But I didn't order no hit on no priest.

210
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:31,752
But at least now the Prophets know
what it's like to lose a local hero.

211
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:38,959
You wanna tell me why you were
breaking bread with the thugs?

212
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:43,030
- Like he said, community outreach.
- You went to them for protection?

213
00:12:44,698 --> 00:12:48,268
- Don't make me dig deeper.
- You see that billboard?

214
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,804
Can you read it? I can't.

215
00:12:50,804 --> 00:12:54,241
Decade ago, this whole
block was black-owned.

216
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:57,310
Now me, Perry, all that's left.

217
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:02,282
Latin gangs hit my liquor store
19 times in the past year.

218
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:04,751
You think paying out to the
One-Niners isn't robbery?

219
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:07,521
Banger gets shot in a
drive-by, that's one thing.

220
00:13:07,521 --> 00:13:10,257
You put on the colors, you
live and die the life.

221
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:15,262
But that boy, the painter,
he was just trying to do good.

222
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:18,598
You know, we got grandsons
coming up in this neighborhood.

223
00:13:18,598 --> 00:13:21,802
One-Niners might be the only thing
keeping them from the noose.

224
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:24,571
You wanna feel safe, you come to me.

225
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:30,710
I heard that for the first time
40 years ago, after Watts.

226
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:34,648
Been hearing it ever since from
you boys, every few years.

227
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:41,621
Los Profetas didn't rope that guy.

228
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:45,025
Is that what the Niners think?

229
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:46,993
Is that why they
killed Father Zavala?

230
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:49,563
<i>Your ex-girlfriend had
</i>nothing to do with it?

231
00:13:49,563 --> 00:13:50,797
<i>Gitana?</i>

232
00:13:52,099 --> 00:13:54,901
Gitana was just a hit,
like nothing real.

233
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:59,372
You think going to confession once a week
exempts you from being a shitbag low life, Neron?

234
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:03,710
Klee Jones saw an ugly world, tried
to make it a little more beautiful.

235
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:06,746
He gave back. What'd you give?

236
00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:08,615
What's everybody getting
so torn up about?

237
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:10,750
There's dudes getting dead out
there every day.

238
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,352
This dude...

239
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,921
...was lynched.

240
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:18,425
- I thought he was hung?
- Lynching is being hung.

241
00:14:18,425 --> 00:14:20,894
- You ever read a history book?
- I tried not to.

242
00:14:20,894 --> 00:14:24,097
Lynching's what they used
to terrorize the ex-slaves.

243
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:27,734
That's how the Klan
dealt with race-mixers.

244
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:29,402
If I'm gonna do somebody...

245
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:31,671
<i>...I'm not gonna waste my time look for
no tree and a rope...</i>

246
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:33,940
<i>...when there's a million
guns lying around.</i>

247
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:38,578
You tell Los Profetas,
if he starts retribution,

248
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:43,248
I will shut down all your street trade
and lock all of you up.

249
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:49,456
David.

250
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:53,593
You gonna shut down all their street trade and
lock them up? How you gonna follow up on that threat?

251
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:56,062
We got a rally in two hours,
and I don't want bloodshed.

252
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:59,466
Using that guy as your errand
boy is a short-term fix.

253
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:01,468
That's all we got time for.

254
00:15:01,468 --> 00:15:04,204
Now get him out of here so
he can pass on the message.

255
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:07,908
Look what crawled out of the gutter.

256
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:10,844
Thought you guys were neck-deep in
that homeless-torching thing?

257
00:15:10,844 --> 00:15:14,848
- Six days of undercover setup gone to shit.
- Why, what happened?

258
00:15:14,848 --> 00:15:16,683
Claudette brought us
for this lynching.

259
00:15:16,683 --> 00:15:17,784
Why?

260
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:20,520
It's pure gangland.
It's not a Decoy thing.

261
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:24,858
I'm sure she's got a plan.

262
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:28,128
Why the hell did you pull us off?

263
00:15:29,196 --> 00:15:32,165
I want Trish and Annie
inside this the community rally.

264
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:33,900
You want my team pressing a crowd?

265
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,503
We had two homicides that created
enough racial tension...

266
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:38,905
Three homeless dead, and a fourth
one's gonna be toast...

267
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:41,675
- ... because you can't keep your finger off.
- Stop that right there.

268
00:15:41,675 --> 00:15:45,245
Last week you tanked a major case, now
you want us into mall security?

269
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:47,480
- It's bullshit.
- I made a mistake.

270
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,550
I start digging in your
jacket, I won't find a few?

271
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,619
None that almost killed a cop.

272
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:55,388
If you can't find it within
yourself to work with me, fine.

273
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:58,358
You're docked.
Catch up on paperwork.

274
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:00,894
You signing off on this?

275
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:05,232
The job gets done when we trust
the decisions of our superiors.

276
00:16:05,232 --> 00:16:08,235
- If he's out, we're all out.
- There's a chair.

277
00:16:08,235 --> 00:16:10,570
There's six weeks of F.I.'s to file.

278
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:20,780
Mr. Rabinowitz?

279
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:26,419
I thought you were a doctor. I've
been waiting here 40 minutes.

280
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:28,388
- You were mugged?
- Corman Street.

281
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:31,057
This man, he jumps from
nowhere with a pipe...

282
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:34,561
- ...yells, "Give me your money."
- And you did?

283
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:37,664
Yes. And then he smashed my knee.

284
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,332
Took my streimel.

285
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:42,235
- He didn't have to hit you.
- What did I say?

286
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:44,704
When these things happen,
we must be strong.

287
00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:49,009
- Can you give us a description?
- Asian, black hair.

288
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:50,910
Had a bandage on his arm.

289
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,679
Bandage?

290
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:55,649
Our arrest percentages are down
30 percent since we've been here.

291
00:16:55,649 --> 00:16:57,584
We never had this kind interference
at Wilshire.

292
00:16:57,584 --> 00:16:59,919
- Yeah, it's not right.
- We gotta get free again.

293
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:02,956
This team is the
assistant chief's baby.

294
00:17:02,956 --> 00:17:04,791
Phillips will listen to me.

295
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,593
I just need a witness.

296
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:10,297
Look, I don't wanna be the one
responsible for letting you slip away.

297
00:17:10,297 --> 00:17:11,865
It'll all be off the record.

298
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:15,702
Phillips just needs to know
that I'm not overreacting.

299
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,837
He does that sometimes.

300
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:20,974
- I can relate.
- You can count me in as a witness.

301
00:17:20,974 --> 00:17:23,009
Hold on, hold on.

302
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,412
You really want out?

303
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:30,417
Okay.

304
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:34,120
I'll back you up. But you
gotta do the right thing.

305
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,256
I need Trish and Annie
to work the rally.

306
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:38,591
My guys are the wrong shade of black.

307
00:17:40,427 --> 00:17:42,429
Hey, Vic, you got a sec?

308
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:43,863
They're all yours.

309
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:51,638
We just took a mugging call at Mission Cross,
sounds like seem the guy who attacked your wife.

310
00:17:51,638 --> 00:17:53,973
- Any leads?
- I'm tracking the stolen credit cards.

311
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:56,343
- Let me know.
- Okay.

312
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:02,349
This guy hurt Corrine.

313
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:04,384
He can't come in
feeling good about that.

314
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:05,819
What's the favor?

315
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:07,554
He turns up...

316
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,657
...before you bring
him in, you call me.

317
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:12,792
Okay.

318
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:18,431
Ready?

319
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:19,866
You bet.

320
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:28,208
We appreciate your support
and your concern.

321
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,104
Our purpose for being here today...

322
00:18:30,105 --> 00:18:33,565
...is not to just to talk about
this travesty that's happened...

323
00:18:33,566 --> 00:18:36,549
...but um, to create a forum...

324
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:40,754
...for our awareness, answers.

325
00:18:40,754 --> 00:18:44,958
Right now I'd like to turn over
the mike to Reverend Leeman.

326
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:52,432
Would you all be kind enough
to join hands, please?

327
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:57,470
Lord Jesus, we ask you to guide
our hearts and our minds.

328
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:01,341
Renew our faith, O Lord,
and open our eyes....

329
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:05,812
I hear you're responsible for having
Trish and Annie change their minds.

330
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:08,314
Walon was way out of line.

331
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:09,649
Thanks.

332
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:12,085
No problem.

333
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,358
Now, what do you guys got?

334
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:21,861
Not much conversation, but spotted
six sporting One-nine ink.

335
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:25,598
- Couple baby bangers.
- Four of them with unnatural bulges.

336
00:19:25,598 --> 00:19:27,333
Okay, point them out to my guys.

337
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,702
They'll be the first ones
we jump if this goes ugly.

338
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:30,970
Okay.

339
00:19:32,906 --> 00:19:35,208
It's all stirred up, isn't it?

340
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,444
- Yeah.
- Hey, Vic.

341
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:43,249
Sorry, boys, crusade's been canceled.

342
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:44,717
Ain't no holy war, homes.

343
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:47,287
- Just come to listen.
- You're too smart for this, Suvuto.

344
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:50,290
Come on, why don't you guys get in
your cars and bounce on out of here?

345
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,358
Ladies and gentlemen,
stay where you are.

346
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:54,561
Let the police officers do their job.

347
00:19:54,561 --> 00:19:56,596
This Captain Aceveda is right...

348
00:19:56,596 --> 00:19:59,432
Hey, ése, you got balls coming
here and break up our rally.

349
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:01,935
They're not looking for a fight,
neither are you.

350
00:20:01,935 --> 00:20:05,305
No, we're just looking for
a priest-killer, homes.

351
00:20:20,487 --> 00:20:24,257
- Anybody hurt?
- Everyone clear this area now.

352
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:29,429
...or you will be arrested,
clear the area now.

353
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:36,536
- You got a name for me?
- Yeah, I got a lot of names for you.

354
00:20:36,536 --> 00:20:39,406
- Keep that sense of humor.
- Why are you locking me up, man?

355
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:41,575
We was there like anybody else, man.

356
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:44,578
No one else was jamming clips
into semi-nines, dude.

357
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:48,415
What you talking about man? Was the thorn heads
came up in there looking for blood and shit.

358
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:51,985
Why don't you talk through the fence,
maybe some racial harmony will break out.

359
00:20:51,985 --> 00:20:54,754
- Man, you ain't nothing but a rat.
- What's up?

360
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:58,325
We found firecracker scraps.
That's what incited the shootings.

361
00:20:58,325 --> 00:21:00,393
Pol Com and the archbishop
have riot fears.

362
00:21:00,393 --> 00:21:02,762
They're pressuring us
to bring in the FBI.

363
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:05,832
- Put the National Guard on standby.
- That's a bad move.

364
00:21:05,832 --> 00:21:08,802
- Sends a message we've lost control.
- So we haven't?

365
00:21:08,802 --> 00:21:10,837
We'll solve these, calm the waters.

366
00:21:10,837 --> 00:21:13,039
How much time before
the feds show up?

367
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,876
The chief wants me reporting
and from here the next 24 hours.

368
00:21:15,876 --> 00:21:19,546
That buys us some time.
Let's see where we are by then.

369
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:23,683
I sense some disharmony
between you and Tobar.

370
00:21:23,683 --> 00:21:26,319
- Kern keeps us civilized.
- Kern's in Europe.

371
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:29,923
- I should've come to you first.
- Come to me about what?

372
00:21:29,923 --> 00:21:34,094
I gave Tobar the chance to give up
the Niner who offed the priest.

373
00:21:34,094 --> 00:21:36,963
He blew it. I'm making
you the same offer.

374
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:38,431
Okay, where's my upside?

375
00:21:38,431 --> 00:21:41,501
When you give up the
killer, with some proof...

376
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:44,037
...I'll get you your
boys out of lockup.

377
00:21:44,037 --> 00:21:46,439
Let you do business rent-free.

378
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:49,476
Come on, Mackey. Everybody
knows you've been shut down.

379
00:21:49,476 --> 00:21:51,878
You're not on the street
enough to landlord.

380
00:21:53,246 --> 00:21:55,415
I'm getting the keys
to the city back.

381
00:22:00,187 --> 00:22:01,855
Spoke to Lem and Ronnie.

382
00:22:01,855 --> 00:22:03,657
When you gonna ask me about the cash?

383
00:22:03,657 --> 00:22:07,294
Don't have to. None of us
took it, none of us spent it.

384
00:22:07,294 --> 00:22:09,262
Trail won't lead back to us.

385
00:22:09,262 --> 00:22:11,331
Yeah, I believe Lem and Ronnie too.

386
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:14,234
But that seven grand didn't
just spontaneously combust.

387
00:22:14,234 --> 00:22:16,836
And now Aceveda's pulling his
marked-money list from the safe.

388
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:19,439
He's hooking the Treasury
guy up with Rodriguez.

389
00:22:19,439 --> 00:22:21,775
Nothing's gonna lead back to us.

390
00:22:21,775 --> 00:22:24,377
Okay. But if those flagged
bills have anything to do...

391
00:22:24,377 --> 00:22:25,745
...with our missing cash...

392
00:22:25,745 --> 00:22:28,248
...I'd sure like to know who
the hell's spending it.

393
00:22:29,683 --> 00:22:33,019
Rodriguez, I thought you were pulling
those like-crime stats for me?

394
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:34,988
Sorry. Wagenbach's
working the hanging.

395
00:22:34,988 --> 00:22:37,624
I got stuck working this
Armenian-mob thing.

396
00:22:37,624 --> 00:22:41,695
I'll be in the car, we better hurry.
It's a long trip. Place closes at 4.

397
00:22:41,695 --> 00:22:44,431
- Where you headed?
- Some bank in Indio.

398
00:22:44,431 --> 00:22:46,866
- Where the hell's that?
- Palm Desert.

399
00:22:47,801 --> 00:22:49,369
Sounds hot.

400
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,639
How did our cash end
up in the desert?

401
00:22:52,639 --> 00:22:54,507
It's not from the 20
grand Diagur took.

402
00:22:54,507 --> 00:22:56,176
Those marked bills were scooped up.

403
00:22:56,176 --> 00:22:58,712
What gang's running meth through
that part of the state these days?

404
00:22:58,712 --> 00:23:02,816
I don't know. Aceveda and the chief had us
out of the loop the last few months.

405
00:23:02,816 --> 00:23:05,619
Street sweeps and dime-bag
bust quotas let us lay low.

406
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:08,955
Laying low's kept us in the dark.
We gotta get back to basics.

407
00:23:08,955 --> 00:23:11,024
Plug back into the street intel.

408
00:23:11,024 --> 00:23:13,493
Make ourselves indispensable
to the department again.

409
00:23:13,493 --> 00:23:15,528
Best defense is a good offense.

410
00:23:15,528 --> 00:23:18,331
How we gonna get Aceveda and
the chief to unleash us?

411
00:23:18,331 --> 00:23:21,568
We won't have to. Walon's
gonna do it for us.

412
00:23:22,335 --> 00:23:24,437
Meantime, as long as
there's no paper trail...

413
00:23:24,437 --> 00:23:27,440
...leading from the marked bills
in Indio to us, we're golden.

414
00:23:35,882 --> 00:23:38,285
Can you tell us how long
was Klee painting that mural?

415
00:23:38,285 --> 00:23:39,619
About two weeks.

416
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:42,989
Did you ever see anyone harass
him, complain about it?

417
00:23:42,989 --> 00:23:44,224
No.

418
00:23:44,224 --> 00:23:47,494
- Did you ever talk to him at all?
- No.

419
00:23:47,494 --> 00:23:50,830
He was right across the street for
two weeks. You never spoke to him?

420
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,365
He didn't come in, buy a soda?

421
00:23:52,365 --> 00:23:54,734
Didn't pay the boy
that much attention.

422
00:23:54,734 --> 00:23:56,536
Not an art lover, huh?

423
00:23:56,536 --> 00:24:00,640
His painting's good and all that.
Just sends the wrong message.

424
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,242
What message is that, sir?

425
00:24:02,242 --> 00:24:05,178
You know, in this neighborhood,
you gotta choose a side.

426
00:24:05,178 --> 00:24:07,781
I'm black. That's my side.

427
00:24:07,781 --> 00:24:09,649
Should've been his side too.

428
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:16,056
Hey, Vic.
We pulled a match from the books.

429
00:24:18,591 --> 00:24:21,795
Tung Yung? I wish I
felt like laughing.

430
00:24:21,795 --> 00:24:24,331
The other victim's in synagogue.

431
00:24:24,331 --> 00:24:27,200
We're gonna need your wife
to make a positive ID.

432
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,902
Okay.

433
00:24:28,902 --> 00:24:31,071
Circulate this. There's
a steak dinner in it...

434
00:24:31,071 --> 00:24:33,907
...for the first one who gets me
a face-to-face with this prick.

435
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:38,411
My squad's being wasted here.

436
00:24:38,411 --> 00:24:40,780
Aceveda twisted the chief's
arm to get you guys.

437
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:44,751
He's got us reporting to Wyms. Burying us
in extra layer commands. It's not working.

438
00:24:44,751 --> 00:24:48,288
I got my problems with Wyms too.
Aceveda threw her in the deep end.

439
00:24:48,288 --> 00:24:50,890
It's not her fault she's drowning.

440
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:52,592
You want me to unplug you...

441
00:24:52,592 --> 00:24:55,962
...I'm gonna need a better
argument than a personality clash.

442
00:24:56,563 --> 00:24:59,699
Providing for the homeless is
the mayor's pet project, right?

443
00:24:59,699 --> 00:25:01,501
Yeah.

444
00:25:01,501 --> 00:25:03,570
Might have a hard time explaining
to city hall...

445
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:06,840
...why your crack Decoy Squad was
pulled off the homeless-torching case...

446
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,709
...to file month-old robbery reports.

447
00:25:12,979 --> 00:25:14,681
I'll need details.

448
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:18,318
That's my case.

449
00:25:18,318 --> 00:25:20,720
We're admitted six days.

450
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,122
Perfect cover...

451
00:25:22,122 --> 00:25:23,356
- What?
<i>- I figured out...</i>

452
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:25,358
...why Tobar was flaking
on giving up the knifer.

453
00:25:25,358 --> 00:25:27,494
- Why is that?
- It was his boy, Link.

454
00:25:27,494 --> 00:25:30,096
You'll find the blade and
bloody wear at his crib.

455
00:25:30,096 --> 00:25:31,264
Good work.

456
00:25:31,264 --> 00:25:34,134
Next thing, me and my team
are ear-deep in Barn shit.

457
00:25:34,134 --> 00:25:36,336
Hey, we got a break.

458
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:41,040
Murder weapon. Blood-stained
Yankee jacket.

459
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,542
It's a slam-dunk.

460
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:45,145
- Great.
- This job's still only half done.

461
00:25:45,145 --> 00:25:46,579
Where are we on the hanging?

462
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:49,349
All of the likely suspects
have come up clean.

463
00:25:49,349 --> 00:25:52,285
He doesn't circulate
in the usual world.

464
00:25:52,285 --> 00:25:53,953
We're hitting dead ends.

465
00:25:53,953 --> 00:25:56,022
Decoy Squad hit a dead end too?

466
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:59,025
Father Zavala was killed
by gang violence.

467
00:25:59,025 --> 00:26:01,961
- That's the Strike Team.
- I know what the Strike Team does.

468
00:26:01,961 --> 00:26:04,264
You have the Decoy Squad
in your house also.

469
00:26:04,264 --> 00:26:06,299
Why not put them on this?

470
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:08,368
Because they were docked
for insubordination.

471
00:26:08,368 --> 00:26:11,004
- You docked them?
- I did.

472
00:26:11,004 --> 00:26:13,640
We're keeping the lid on a
racial pressure-cooker.

473
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,675
- I know that.
- You put an entire special unit...

474
00:26:15,675 --> 00:26:19,846
...on a dead Latino priest and docked the team
that could be solving the lynching of a black man?

475
00:26:19,846 --> 00:26:22,882
- That's not the truth.
- The truth is whatever it looks like.

476
00:26:22,882 --> 00:26:26,553
And this looks like racial
prioritizing, councilman.

477
00:26:38,164 --> 00:26:39,599
- Come on.
- Yeah. yeah.

478
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:43,136
- About time you let us out of here.
- It's just long enough to do this.

479
00:26:43,136 --> 00:26:47,407
Elias Linkletter, you're under arrest
for the murder of Father Oleos Zavala.

480
00:26:47,407 --> 00:26:51,244
- This is shit.
- No. This is proof.

481
00:26:52,378 --> 00:26:56,316
Tob, man, I didn't kill him.
I ain't killed no priest, Tob.

482
00:26:56,316 --> 00:26:59,552
You can let this half go.
Except for that one.

483
00:27:00,787 --> 00:27:02,288
Aiding and abetting.

484
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:04,023
Hey, man, you hurt us, you hurt Kern.

485
00:27:04,023 --> 00:27:06,793
Kern's licking caviar off
a Czech girl.

486
00:27:06,793 --> 00:27:08,595
He won't be too hurt.

487
00:27:17,437 --> 00:27:19,339
- I want you to tell me what's wrong.
- Aurora...

488
00:27:19,339 --> 00:27:21,975
I went to Rigoberto.
Spoke to him.

489
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:25,345
Whatever your secret is,
he's keeping it.

490
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:28,114
There's no secret.

491
00:27:28,114 --> 00:27:30,917
You tell your cousin
but not your wife?

492
00:27:31,718 --> 00:27:34,754
A less secure woman might
think there's someone else.

493
00:27:34,754 --> 00:27:37,824
- Babe, I'm not screwing around.
- You're hiding something.

494
00:27:37,824 --> 00:27:40,593
- Please let this go.
- What is it?

495
00:27:41,828 --> 00:27:45,031
- Act like a husband.
- Please.

496
00:27:45,031 --> 00:27:46,432
Just trust me.

497
00:27:46,432 --> 00:27:48,768
- Trust me.
- Aurora.

498
00:27:56,276 --> 00:27:59,445
I'm very scared, David.

499
00:28:16,629 --> 00:28:18,264
Those guys I fought...

500
00:28:21,334 --> 00:28:24,037
...one of them assaulted me.

501
00:28:26,005 --> 00:28:28,007
But you're okay now.

502
00:28:28,575 --> 00:28:30,343
They tied my hands.

503
00:28:31,711 --> 00:28:34,180
And they made me get on my knees.

504
00:28:36,783 --> 00:28:38,418
They made you...

505
00:28:39,586 --> 00:28:41,154
...suck?

506
00:28:43,356 --> 00:28:46,392
- Both of them?
- Just one of them.

507
00:28:50,096 --> 00:28:52,165
You didn't.

508
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:02,075
Wait, you're a cop.
You're trained in...

509
00:29:02,075 --> 00:29:05,078
I was alone. I was in... I was...

510
00:29:05,078 --> 00:29:06,846
No, David.

511
00:29:11,351 --> 00:29:14,020
How could you let that happen?

512
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:17,090
Because I wanted to live...

513
00:29:19,325 --> 00:29:20,193
... for you.

514
00:29:21,461 --> 00:29:24,897
I wanted to live for you and Sophia.

515
00:29:26,866 --> 00:29:28,935
I can't talk about this here.

516
00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:40,614
I never saw that knife...

517
00:29:40,614 --> 00:29:43,317
...and I'd never be
wearing no Yankee rag.

518
00:29:43,317 --> 00:29:46,653
I was born in Boston. Man, I'd
rather take a knife than wear N.Y.

519
00:29:46,653 --> 00:29:50,223
I'm not sure if I'd use the Red
Sox defense in a Dodger town.

520
00:29:50,223 --> 00:29:53,460
That was a horrible thing
they did to Klee Jones.

521
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,429
Lynching a brother's some wrong shit.

522
00:29:57,431 --> 00:29:59,499
Maybe you wanted to
send him a message.

523
00:29:59,499 --> 00:30:01,969
Make sure it didn't
ever happen again.

524
00:30:01,969 --> 00:30:06,006
You got the right message,
but the wrong messenger.

525
00:30:06,006 --> 00:30:07,574
No, we don't.

526
00:30:07,574 --> 00:30:10,777
You stabbed Father Zavala
five times this morning.

527
00:30:10,777 --> 00:30:12,312
No.

528
00:30:14,214 --> 00:30:15,649
This morning?

529
00:30:18,585 --> 00:30:20,787
- I was in my group.
<i>- Group?</i>

530
00:30:20,787 --> 00:30:22,389
<i>Anger therapy?</i>

531
00:30:22,389 --> 00:30:24,091
Kern's shrink?

532
00:30:24,091 --> 00:30:26,827
Been learning to keep
my emotions in check.

533
00:30:29,262 --> 00:30:32,899
He's probably lying about the therapy
sessions, at least when he got there.

534
00:30:32,899 --> 00:30:35,435
The parish raised bail
for the Prophets.

535
00:30:35,435 --> 00:30:39,006
One murder still unsolved and now
all the players are back in action.

536
00:30:41,575 --> 00:30:45,078
Put Walon's team in the mix. Let them spend
the night on the street and see what they hear.

537
00:30:45,078 --> 00:30:47,748
- You said you'd back me on that decision.
- Just do it, already.

538
00:30:47,748 --> 00:30:52,452
Hey. Whatever's been eating at you
lately, don't take it out on her.

539
00:30:52,452 --> 00:30:54,488
She's the main thing keeping this
place glued together.

540
00:30:54,488 --> 00:30:56,023
- That's enough, Dutch.
- No.

541
00:30:56,023 --> 00:30:59,760
You got her juggling a full detective
load plus this supervisory post.

542
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,195
Then hang her out to dry?
That's not leadership.

543
00:31:02,195 --> 00:31:04,131
How's your detective load, Wagenbach?

544
00:31:04,131 --> 00:31:06,967
Anything new on the sick
bastard raping grandmothers?

545
00:31:07,667 --> 00:31:09,102
No.

546
00:31:12,973 --> 00:31:15,308
Hey, Cobalt, how's business?

547
00:31:16,243 --> 00:31:19,813
We're looking for a friend of yours.
An Asian guy trying to score painkillers.

548
00:31:19,813 --> 00:31:21,948
- Aren't we all?
- Mind if we take a look inside?

549
00:31:21,948 --> 00:31:24,251
Mind letting me see a warrant?

550
00:31:24,251 --> 00:31:26,586
That's okay. We'll just
wait for him here.

551
00:31:28,155 --> 00:31:29,890
Greet your customers.

552
00:31:32,492 --> 00:31:34,127
Who you looking for?

553
00:31:35,662 --> 00:31:36,930
He was around.

554
00:31:37,397 --> 00:31:40,067
Tried to give me a ton of
Sudafed for a few Percocet.

555
00:31:40,067 --> 00:31:42,636
- This is a cash-only slot.
- Where'd you send him?

556
00:31:42,636 --> 00:31:45,839
A Thai cat sells scrips out of a
clinic on Hanover and Carmen.

557
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:47,541
Should be there in the morning.

558
00:31:48,809 --> 00:31:49,876
Thanks.

559
00:31:50,544 --> 00:31:52,779
His anger-management
alibi checks out.

560
00:31:52,779 --> 00:31:56,049
He's got a shrink and eight fellow
hotheads who can account for his time.

561
00:31:56,049 --> 00:31:59,186
How did the knife and bloody
sweatshirt get in his place?

562
00:31:59,186 --> 00:32:02,589
I'll follow up on that.
I need a minute.

563
00:32:06,893 --> 00:32:09,463
- What is it?
- I bet on the wrong scumbag.

564
00:32:09,463 --> 00:32:10,797
How'd you do that?

565
00:32:10,797 --> 00:32:13,567
You and Wyms have had me buried
over the last couple of months.

566
00:32:13,567 --> 00:32:15,302
- I'm out of touch.
- Oh, so it's my fault?

567
00:32:15,302 --> 00:32:16,903
- I'll bring in the right guy.
- Good.

568
00:32:16,903 --> 00:32:19,339
But I'll never let this happen again.

569
00:32:19,339 --> 00:32:23,110
I'm no good half in, half out.
Now, you gotta make a choice.

570
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:26,746
You either let me do what I do or I'll
pull the plug on the Strike Team.

571
00:32:26,746 --> 00:32:28,982
Take my boys to another part of town.

572
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:38,425
- Lose the hardware! Lose it!
- Get on the table. On the table.

573
00:32:38,425 --> 00:32:39,693
Drop it.

574
00:32:39,693 --> 00:32:42,462
- What the hell's going on, Mackey?
- It's closing time.

575
00:32:42,462 --> 00:32:45,799
My first task as the new landlord,
get rid of the old tenants.

576
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:48,034
This was not a part
of our transaction.

577
00:32:48,034 --> 00:32:51,304
That deal went south the second you
screwed everyone in this room.

578
00:32:51,304 --> 00:32:52,906
Screwed who?

579
00:32:54,307 --> 00:32:55,442
Shit.

580
00:32:55,442 --> 00:32:58,478
Seems you fingered a man
with an airtight alibi.

581
00:32:58,478 --> 00:33:00,280
Pigs turning us against each other...

582
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,481
Shut up, bastard.

583
00:33:01,481 --> 00:33:03,450
I can see I'm in the way.

584
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:05,719
What you talking about? You can't leave
me here with them, man.

585
00:33:05,719 --> 00:33:07,854
I can't take you with me.
You're an innocent man.

586
00:33:07,854 --> 00:33:09,890
Unless you got something
to confess, Twizzy.

587
00:33:11,358 --> 00:33:13,260
I didn't do nothing.

588
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,495
Okay. Take care.

589
00:33:15,495 --> 00:33:17,063
Vic, where you...?

590
00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:23,703
All right. All right, Vic. All right.

591
00:33:26,606 --> 00:33:29,342
How'd the knife and the Yankee
rag end up under Link's bed?

592
00:33:30,744 --> 00:33:33,547
Not so sure if I remember
all the details now.

593
00:33:33,547 --> 00:33:36,049
Let me refresh you on the math.

594
00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:39,553
You framed number two, which
implicated number one...

595
00:33:39,553 --> 00:33:42,756
...which bounced you from number
three to the new number one.

596
00:33:42,756 --> 00:33:45,458
And that gets you zero.

597
00:33:48,128 --> 00:33:51,965
All right, bastard. Let's let Tobar
and Link finish the interrogation.

598
00:33:51,965 --> 00:33:53,433
Let's go clubbing.

599
00:33:54,901 --> 00:33:58,605
Hey, man, look what we
found at Twizzy's place.

600
00:33:58,605 --> 00:34:00,807
It's the same rope
Klee was hanging from.

601
00:34:01,474 --> 00:34:03,009
<i>Shit.</i>

602
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:14,421
<i>No one's gonna save your ass, Twizzy.
That camera hasn't worked in months.</i>

603
00:34:15,155 --> 00:34:19,292
Now you talk to us or you can talk
to your boys between beatings.

604
00:34:22,629 --> 00:34:26,099
I strung him. You damn right I did.

605
00:34:27,434 --> 00:34:30,937
Someone's got to be the martyr here.
It might as well be me.

606
00:34:30,937 --> 00:34:32,239
Why?

607
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:35,742
That Rainbow Coalition
shit was crushing us.

608
00:34:35,742 --> 00:34:38,278
Kern and Tobar caved on me.

609
00:34:39,145 --> 00:34:40,747
They punked out.

610
00:34:41,114 --> 00:34:43,216
Wanna strike deals with the Lats.

611
00:34:43,216 --> 00:34:47,087
So you decided to set
off the racial bomb.

612
00:34:49,256 --> 00:34:50,624
The priest?

613
00:34:51,324 --> 00:34:53,593
I wanted to see the Prophets cry.

614
00:34:55,362 --> 00:34:56,763
Fuel the war.

615
00:34:57,597 --> 00:34:59,799
Get the Black back.

616
00:34:59,799 --> 00:35:01,668
Farmtown...

617
00:35:01,668 --> 00:35:03,403
...Jack Uzis...

618
00:35:03,403 --> 00:35:05,272
...the local businessmen...

619
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:08,441
...I got them all sitting down.

620
00:35:09,809 --> 00:35:12,412
Talking about working together.
I did.

621
00:35:15,382 --> 00:35:17,550
Black-on-black lynching.

622
00:35:18,285 --> 00:35:20,420
Is that better or worse?

623
00:35:20,854 --> 00:35:22,155
Worse.

624
00:35:24,357 --> 00:35:25,458
Hi.

625
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:29,029
- What's that?
- Open it.

626
00:35:35,835 --> 00:35:38,838
- It's locked.
- It's funny, you know.

627
00:35:38,838 --> 00:35:41,441
I never really lock my lockbox.

628
00:35:42,542 --> 00:35:43,877
Okay.

629
00:35:51,818 --> 00:35:54,487
The reason I never lock it...

630
00:35:54,487 --> 00:35:57,957
...is because I can never remember
where I put the key.

631
00:35:57,957 --> 00:35:59,826
But somebody locked it.

632
00:36:01,695 --> 00:36:06,099
I was looking for some
old photos, some stuff.

633
00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:07,934
I don't know anything about
your family or...

634
00:36:07,934 --> 00:36:10,770
You know, I really know a
lot about your family.

635
00:36:11,371 --> 00:36:13,306
I called your mom in Indio.

636
00:36:14,274 --> 00:36:18,311
She told me about the $7000
care package that you sent.

637
00:36:21,181 --> 00:36:22,882
You'd disappear at night.

638
00:36:25,685 --> 00:36:27,787
I saw you take the
key a couple times.

639
00:36:27,787 --> 00:36:29,956
So you decided that you
would steal from me?

640
00:36:30,657 --> 00:36:34,194
I found a receipt for
a storage facility...

641
00:36:34,194 --> 00:36:36,930
...with your handwriting
and a fake name.

642
00:36:38,098 --> 00:36:40,834
You'd been lying to me. What
did you expect me to do?

643
00:36:40,834 --> 00:36:46,206
Jesus Christ. You have no idea
what kind of trouble this is.

644
00:36:46,206 --> 00:36:48,475
You know what trouble
I've been going through?

645
00:36:50,243 --> 00:36:52,979
- Why are you hiding money from me?
- You stole from me!

646
00:36:52,979 --> 00:36:55,248
You stole from me!

647
00:36:55,248 --> 00:36:58,785
That trunk was filled with cash.
I just took what I needed.

648
00:36:58,785 --> 00:37:01,688
For us. Us.

649
00:37:01,688 --> 00:37:03,623
What happened to us?

650
00:37:07,227 --> 00:37:10,330
- You gonna lie to your child too?
- Hey, don't you go turn this around.

651
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:16,403
My mother's a goddamn cancer.
She was being evicted.

652
00:37:16,403 --> 00:37:18,972
She would've showed
up on our doorstep.

653
00:37:18,972 --> 00:37:21,007
I didn't want her to ruin this.

654
00:37:22,475 --> 00:37:24,911
You shouldn't have looked
into those trunks.

655
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:32,385
Is there money in all those trunks?

656
00:37:35,422 --> 00:37:38,358
- Is it drug money?
- You don't get to ask that question.

657
00:37:40,326 --> 00:37:43,062
- But it's from your job, right?
- Just stop asking.

658
00:37:44,531 --> 00:37:46,766
Should I ask Vic instead?

659
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:51,938
Is it Vic's money?

660
00:37:53,606 --> 00:37:55,942
- Did you steal it from him?
- No.

661
00:37:55,942 --> 00:37:59,679
- Then where did it come from?
- Just forget that you saw it.

662
00:38:00,246 --> 00:38:03,383
- How am I supposed to do that?
- Look, l...

663
00:38:03,383 --> 00:38:04,918
You just do it.

664
00:38:12,625 --> 00:38:13,927
Hey.

665
00:38:16,262 --> 00:38:18,331
Look, you don't take any more cash.

666
00:38:19,032 --> 00:38:21,301
Don't breathe a word
about this to anybody.

667
00:38:22,068 --> 00:38:27,073
Now we gotta figure out what to have your mother
say in case people start asking questions.

668
00:38:27,073 --> 00:38:31,411
- Who's gonna ask her questions?
- The money wasn't supposed to be spent.

669
00:38:38,585 --> 00:38:41,087
When it comes to money,
we can't trust her.

670
00:38:41,087 --> 00:38:43,389
Then we're gonna have to
find a way to control her.

671
00:38:44,424 --> 00:38:46,993
Because if this money
gets traced back to me...

672
00:38:48,461 --> 00:38:50,430
...this is life-and-death shit...

673
00:38:51,331 --> 00:38:52,866
...for all of us.

674
00:39:06,413 --> 00:39:08,315
Is this the man who attacked you?

675
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:11,351
- Yeah. That's him.
- Great.

676
00:39:11,351 --> 00:39:14,021
The old Jew he mugged has
been in temple lockdown.

677
00:39:14,021 --> 00:39:16,123
Now we can finally arrest this prick.

678
00:39:18,725 --> 00:39:20,460
Did I say something wrong?

679
00:39:22,195 --> 00:39:25,699
- I'm sorry, are you Jewish?
- Someone keyed Owen's car.

680
00:39:25,699 --> 00:39:28,435
Scratched "Stay away"
across the trunk.

681
00:39:28,435 --> 00:39:29,936
You think I did it?

682
00:39:29,936 --> 00:39:32,039
It had to have been done
last night before I left.

683
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:35,409
If I wanted you to stay away, I
wouldn't scratch it in your Volvo.

684
00:39:35,409 --> 00:39:37,644
- You'd scratch it across my face?
- Owen.

685
00:39:37,644 --> 00:39:40,480
- What are you telling this guy?
- Nothing I can't see for myself.

686
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,849
You keep your mouth shut
in front of my kids.

687
00:39:42,849 --> 00:39:44,618
- Don't yell at him.
- Stop it.

688
00:39:45,852 --> 00:39:47,421
I wrote it.

689
00:39:47,421 --> 00:39:49,122
- Cassidy.
- No, I'll do it.

690
00:40:04,805 --> 00:40:06,573
I don't want him here.

691
00:40:07,474 --> 00:40:10,010
Owen makes your mommy happy, honey.

692
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:12,846
Why can't you make Mommy happy?

693
00:40:12,846 --> 00:40:14,648
I'd be hurt if I were you too.

694
00:40:17,184 --> 00:40:18,985
I will always be your dad.

695
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:21,888
And your mommy will
always be your mommy.

696
00:40:22,622 --> 00:40:24,324
That's never gonna change.

697
00:40:25,926 --> 00:40:27,828
Everything is changing.

698
00:40:30,397 --> 00:40:31,498
Yes?

699
00:40:32,732 --> 00:40:35,602
The Decoy Squad's being
transferred to South Central.

700
00:40:35,602 --> 00:40:37,270
- When?
- Tomorrow.

701
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:39,406
- Who?
- It's the assistant chief's call.

702
00:40:40,507 --> 00:40:42,876
I didn't fight it. It
wasn't gonna work.

703
00:40:42,876 --> 00:40:45,846
We can still get done what we
need to with the Strike Team.

704
00:40:45,846 --> 00:40:49,950
Vic and his guys are going back to
full-time anti-gang and vice status.

705
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:53,153
You're putting them
back on the street?

706
00:40:53,153 --> 00:40:55,122
I'm no longer running the team.

707
00:40:56,022 --> 00:40:59,192
I had no time to consult with you.
It all went down pretty quickly.

708
00:40:59,759 --> 00:41:00,961
You, uh...

709
00:41:03,263 --> 00:41:05,999
You'll resume your regular
detective rotation.

710
00:41:05,999 --> 00:41:08,468
So strike one and I'm out?

711
00:41:09,769 --> 00:41:12,239
It was my fault. I had
you half in, half out.

712
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:14,708
- And I should've just let...
- You're the boss.

713
00:41:15,609 --> 00:41:17,878
You don't have to
explain your decision.

714
00:41:28,922 --> 00:41:31,825
Charges against your
boys have been dropped.

715
00:41:32,459 --> 00:41:33,727
I heard.

716
00:41:33,727 --> 00:41:35,729
You also hear that
we know who did it?

717
00:41:36,796 --> 00:41:39,032
Tell Los Profetas no
more retribution.

718
00:41:39,032 --> 00:41:41,001
That's God's decision.

719
00:41:41,001 --> 00:41:43,937
God's decided to put
me back in business.

720
00:41:44,971 --> 00:41:47,207
My streets, my rules.

721
00:41:47,207 --> 00:41:49,910
- Niners ain't playing by the rules.
- Twizzy was a rogue.

722
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:52,946
Kern, Tobar never would
have let that happen.

723
00:41:54,381 --> 00:41:55,849
We still got pain.

724
00:41:56,950 --> 00:42:00,053
Twizzy will be in county
until his hearing.

725
00:42:00,053 --> 00:42:02,722
That'll give you a few weeks
to get someone inside.

726
00:42:02,722 --> 00:42:04,591
Stop the pain.

727
00:42:07,027 --> 00:42:10,263
Anything after that,
commit any sins...

728
00:42:11,131 --> 00:42:13,466
...I'll be nailing you to a cross.

729
00:42:31,284 --> 00:42:33,353
Thank God you caught the guy.

730
00:42:34,654 --> 00:42:36,556
Yeah, people are relieved.

731
00:42:37,224 --> 00:42:39,492
The election should
be smooth sailing.

732
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,128
Good.

733
00:42:45,865 --> 00:42:48,001
I just came home to change.

734
00:42:48,001 --> 00:42:49,336
Okay.

735
00:42:52,372 --> 00:42:54,207
He's early.

736
00:43:00,947 --> 00:43:02,382
Tung Yung?

737
00:43:15,729 --> 00:43:17,063
Stay down.

738
00:43:18,598 --> 00:43:19,899
Stay down.

739
00:43:44,024 --> 00:43:45,625
What's the target?

740
00:43:45,625 --> 00:43:47,127
Blue house.

741
00:43:47,127 --> 00:43:49,829
Russians. Fresh from the Kremlin.

742
00:43:49,829 --> 00:43:53,400
Moving in, moving weight.
China white.

743
00:43:55,035 --> 00:43:57,570
I got some bad news, Boris.

744
00:43:59,239 --> 00:44:01,741
Air just tastes better
today, doesn't it?

745
00:44:03,276 --> 00:44:04,544
Yeah.

746
00:44:05,812 --> 00:44:07,447
Vic, l....

747
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:11,484
What?

748
00:44:12,285 --> 00:44:13,920
It's good to be back.

749
00:44:27,363 --> 00:44:29,147
Thank you so much.

750
00:44:31,338 --> 00:44:34,240
- Where do you want him?
- Put him in 2.

751
00:45:21,354 --> 00:45:22,188
Knock, knock.

752
00:45:27,827 --> 00:45:31,264
- Put your hands up! Turn in up!
- Right there! On the ground!

753
00:45:32,022 --> 00:45:33,447
On the ground!
Right there!

754
00:45:33,967 --> 00:45:35,769
Down, down.

755
00:45:38,037 --> 00:45:40,206
Welcome to the neighbourhood.
