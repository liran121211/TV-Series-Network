1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,135
<i>Previously on "The Shield".</i>

2
00:00:02,135 --> 00:00:04,037
Just because you been
on the sidelines...

3
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:05,705
...doesn't mean you have
to play Wonder Woman.

4
00:00:05,705 --> 00:00:08,441
Though I might be able to
dig up the outfit for you.

5
00:00:08,441 --> 00:00:12,379
Victim's name is Isabel
Nelson, raped by a lone male.

6
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:14,948
Guy was waiting in the house
naked when she came home.

7
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:16,249
Isabel's 73.

8
00:00:16,249 --> 00:00:19,986
We think this cuddler rapist
has been around for a while.

9
00:00:19,986 --> 00:00:23,523
Mueller's results have been proven
accurate down to the square block.

10
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,492
His fee is $5000.

11
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:27,394
- Right.
- No. We don't have the money.

12
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:30,931
Two of the bills you had in
your possession were marked.

13
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:33,800
Currency stolen from an
Armenian money-laundering ring.

14
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,001
Holy shit.

15
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:36,203
<i>We've been waiting for it to show up.</i>

16
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:37,571
<i>- Guess what?
</i>- Our money is marked?

17
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:38,972
<i>It showed up in your hands.</i>

18
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:40,473
Chew on this, baby.

19
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:43,610
We just found out the feds marked
some of our money train cash.

20
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,412
- What?
- Part of a sting they're doing...

21
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:47,914
- ...on the Armenians.
- Shit.

22
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:49,583
Deep.

23
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:51,451
I get this to the lab before 5...

24
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:54,154
...I can get fingerprint results
by morning. You coming?

25
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:56,323
I'm curious what else
we might find here.

26
00:00:57,123 --> 00:00:59,259
Police! On your knees, man.

27
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:03,096
Let's see that mouth. Suck it!

28
00:01:34,995 --> 00:01:36,263
Anything?

29
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:39,065
Shit.

30
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:44,337
All right, we switch, do it
all again with new eyes.

31
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:46,840
- Goddamn.
- Shit.

32
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,543
We can't spend a nickel until
we know which bills are marked.

33
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:54,047
I'm gonna check for dummy
serial numbers this time.

34
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:56,616
Who's got the Federal Reserve seal?

35
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,418
I'll take it. Here.

36
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:04,591
The cuddler rape case.

37
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:07,027
- How many victims so far?
- Five.

38
00:02:07,027 --> 00:02:10,163
- We're going to the press tomorrow.
- No. Not yet.

39
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:12,299
The reporters are already calling.

40
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:14,634
They've got the story.
We'll give them our side.

41
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,637
We got a list of sex offenders,
guys with prior robberies.

42
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,239
Let us talk to them first.

43
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:23,043
There've gotta be a hundred suspects
at least. It'll take you a month.

44
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:26,479
Actually, we've narrowed
the list down to 1 4.

45
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,381
How?

46
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:30,950
- We got the geo-profile.
- I said no to that.

47
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,852
When I told the profiler
who the victims were...

48
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:35,288
...he offered to do
it for half-price.

49
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:36,956
His grandma put him through school.

50
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:38,658
It's still too much.

51
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,328
Twenty-five hundred.
I wrote him a check.

52
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:43,496
If it doesn't work out,
take it out of my salary.

53
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,931
Believe me, I will.

54
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:47,133
Okay.

55
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:51,738
The profiler gave us hot zones, places
where the guy likely lives or works.

56
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:54,341
Plus we've got high-risk
areas for future rapes.

57
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,975
Talk to whoever you need to.

58
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:58,078
But you got 24 hours till
the press conference.

59
00:02:58,078 --> 00:03:00,914
What if our guy has a lust for fame?

60
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:04,150
Going public will build his
confidence, make him more dangerous.

61
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,318
Give us another week.

62
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:06,986
Potential rape victims
need to know the threat...

63
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:10,824
...and they need to know it now.
You've got until tomorrow.

64
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:31,511
You're early.

65
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:34,280
You wanted me to check
the pool filter.

66
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,349
I'll do it before I
take Cass to the game.

67
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:38,084
Okay, I'll go get her ready.

68
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:54,167
- Noisy.
- Right.

69
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:55,869
Hey, Mr. Mackey. How's it going?

70
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:01,040
- Hey, little man.
- That's enough for today, Matthew.

71
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,177
You did a good job. I'm proud of you.
Let's pack up.

72
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,948
He's working on understanding
concepts as well as objects.

73
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:10,750
Like a horn's not just
a horn, but it's...

74
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,820
Noisy. I get it. It's good.

75
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:19,058
Matthew, those don't go there.

76
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:20,593
Let's put them in your
room right now, okay?

77
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:23,263
- He can get it later.
- He knows he needs to do it now.

78
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:26,599
And I said he can do it later.
I got a job for him.

79
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,770
She's getting her uniform on.
She'll be out in a minute.

80
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,073
I'll be by the pool. Come on, Matt.
Help your dad.

81
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,949
Hey, I talked to a nurse.
Tavon's doing a lot better.

82
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,218
- That's great.
- Yeah. Yeah, it is.

83
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:47,987
- He's off the ventilator.
- Who? Tavon?

84
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:50,423
Yeah. He's still not
responding to voices...

85
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:53,860
...but breathing on his
own was a big hurdle.

86
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,863
He could have a full recovery.
I'm gonna see him after work.

87
00:04:56,863 --> 00:05:00,633
- Anybody wanna come with?
- I can't make it today.

88
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:05,138
Look, I got another idea on
how to track those bills.

89
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:10,243
You know those lists the feds send
around to banks to track counterfeits?

90
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:11,945
You can't just walk into a bank...

91
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:15,114
...and ask to see their watch list
without attracting attention.

92
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:19,385
Those lists also go around to
check-cashing places, lndian casinos.

93
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:22,822
Anyway, I know this wink
joint, he cashes checks.

94
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:26,326
I go in, I tin Uncle Ho, say I need
to make sure his list is current.

95
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,660
He'll go for that?

96
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,997
If it keeps me from poking around his
backroom where he's pimping cooch.

97
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,366
Yeah, I think he'll go for it.

98
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,768
Yeah, that's not bad.

99
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:38,304
- Just keep it quiet.
- Okay.

100
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:41,608
All here.

101
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,077
You're assigned to Trish for the day.

102
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:46,212
I'll try to break you in easy.

103
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:50,850
Got gay bashers going after male
hustlers out on the stroll.

104
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,685
Where's the rest of the Decoy Squad?

105
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,721
- Deep cover.
- Trish will fill you in...

106
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:58,591
- ...on operational details.
- Just for the record.

107
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:01,127
I have no problem working
with the Decoy Squad...

108
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:05,498
- ...but we don't work for them.
- That's right. You work for me.

109
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:15,575
- Who the hell wrote this?
- Who do you think? Nina.

110
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:17,777
What, are we in third grade?

111
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,682
Hey, that yours?

112
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:26,386
- Tommy Hisk?
- Yeah?

113
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,255
Detective Kouf, Wilshire.
Can I talk with you?

114
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:32,659
- Shoot.
- Do you wanna come with me?

115
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:34,093
I'm about to go on duty.

116
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:35,562
Just step outside.

117
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:38,331
Go get the captain.

118
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:47,273
Your ex-wife and son
were found murdered.

119
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:48,775
I'm very sorry.

120
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:52,512
I need to take you
to Wilshire with me.

121
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:55,148
- Wait a minute. Why?
- That's my captain's orders.

122
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:57,216
This happens, he wants to sweat him?

123
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:59,752
- Just a couple of questions.
- We're all cops here.

124
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,487
Think I had something
to do with this?

125
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:03,690
It's procedure. What do you want?

126
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,159
Save him the car ride, and
you talk to him here.

127
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:08,127
You do it fast, and
you get it over with.

128
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,377
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

129
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:38,958
Where were you last night
between 10 and 11 p.m.?

130
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:43,563
- Is that when they...?
- Just where were you?

131
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:53,173
I don't know. I worked
late and went home.

132
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:56,009
Okay. Were you with anyone
like a girlfriend maybe or...?

133
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:58,011
- I don't have a girlfriend.
- I'm sorry?

134
00:07:58,011 --> 00:07:59,879
I don't have a girlfriend.

135
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,281
This is bullshit.

136
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:03,650
I heard his divorce got
nasty, but come on.

137
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,319
They'll get a statement,
see there's nothing there.

138
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,055
Meanwhile, the real killer's
trail is going cold.

139
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:12,959
It's Wilshire's case.
Your team's got yours.

140
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:20,567
- How old was his kid?
- Four or 5. Goddamn it.

141
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:23,002
We gotta posse up.

142
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:27,273
Find out who did Tommy's family.
Who's coming?

143
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:29,142
True they got him up
in Interrogation?

144
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:30,610
We're gonna fix that.

145
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,645
Talking about disappearing
off the grid?

146
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:35,014
If the hammer doesn't come
down fast and hard...

147
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,884
...the message is cops and
their families are fair game.

148
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:40,387
I got cage duty. What
can I do from here?

149
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:41,888
Run a records search.

150
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:44,224
Anyone Tommy's put away,
recently paroled.

151
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:47,427
I'll check out the crime scene.
You canvas the neighborhood.

152
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:48,728
Okay.

153
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,367
Change of plans. I'm calling in sick.

154
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:56,369
Are you?

155
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,639
I could put a penny under my tongue
or you can take me at my word.

156
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,741
This about that family
getting killed?

157
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:04,611
The only reason your boss
is dicking with Tommy...

158
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:07,814
...is because Aceveda took you
and your team from Wilshire.

159
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:09,182
This is payback.

160
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:11,351
What am I supposed to tell Claudette?

161
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:13,453
Tell her I was present
and accounted for.

162
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:16,122
She spanks me, I'll spank you.

163
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,826
- Hey, Vic. I'm coming too.
- No.

164
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:22,996
I'm not sitting around on flamer
duty while Tommy gets boned.

165
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:26,299
You've got problems of your own if
Tavon comes to. I need you here.

166
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,234
- Vic, come on.
- I got some bodies.

167
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,470
I'll handle it. You
handle this for me.

168
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,810
Hey, Julien. You hear about Tommy?

169
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,344
Yeah. No way he did this.

170
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:42,182
A bunch of us are going out
there to prove it. You want in?

171
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:44,551
Yeah. He was my partner,
I knew his son.

172
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:48,121
It's a deep blue run. There could be
consequences, a little hot water.

173
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:54,227
- Okay.
- Good, you're in. Let's go.

174
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:59,899
Did you place any calls, so
we can prove you were home?

175
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:03,436
No. Look, I wanna see them.

176
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:05,104
When can I see them?

177
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,940
It's all right. We won't
be here too long.

178
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:12,245
Excuse me a minute.

179
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:18,952
She's been crying for you.

180
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,321
She doesn't understand
where you've been.

181
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:25,291
I'm sorry, it's been
really busy right now.

182
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,993
You're always busy.

183
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:29,562
That's never stopped you
from coming home before.

184
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:33,533
- I can't get into it right now.
- Well, we're here right now.

185
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,135
That's all you gotta say?

186
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:43,176
- Will you be home for dinner?
- I don't know how long I'll be.

187
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:45,011
- Spending the night?
- I don't know.

188
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:48,381
For God's sake, what
have you been doing?

189
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,618
One of my cops found out his
family's been murdered.

190
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:55,221
On top of that, he's a suspect. And
then you've been calling all day.

191
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:57,423
Then you bring Sophia down here.

192
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:01,394
You know, what are you thinking?
You know, qué piensas?

193
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:02,896
Calm down.

194
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:07,734
Yeah.

195
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:10,236
Hey.

196
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,644
I'll be home when I get home.

197
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:25,952
I'll call it in.

198
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:28,655
Mind if we take a look around?

199
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:30,390
You're in the wrong
district, aren't you?

200
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,359
This was the family
of one of our guys.

201
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,928
Yeah. I heard.

202
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:36,329
Techs are still inside.

203
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:39,232
No one's gonna disturb
your crime scene, man.

204
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:43,303
Normally, sure, but the captain's
taken a special interest in this.

205
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:44,704
He could stop by any time.

206
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,907
We just wanna help out a friend
who lost his wife and kid.

207
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:49,742
He was caught up in the
middle of a pissing match...

208
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,911
...between your boss and ours.

209
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:57,050
Look, I'm not trying to
be a pain in the ass.

210
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,620
Two minutes. We just
wanna see what happened.

211
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:04,824
Look, they can wait outside.
Just me and Tommy's partner.

212
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:08,761
- Two minutes. In and out.
- Thanks.

213
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:17,870
He came in a back window.
Broken lock.

214
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:22,542
Wife was stabbed a couple dozen times.
The sister found her.

215
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:23,876
Anything missing?

216
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:27,914
Off the top of her head, a silver
tea set and some jewellery.

217
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,654
The kid ran to hide under the bed.

218
00:12:34,654 --> 00:12:36,956
Killer found him and
slashed his throat.

219
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:50,236
You think God's gonna show any
mercy to the person who did this?

220
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:56,476
How bad was it?

221
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:59,646
That was a speed murder. The guy
had to be cranked on something.

222
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:02,148
Neighbors say there's been
a lot of break-ins lately.

223
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:05,318
There's a crack house right
over there, across the street.

224
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:08,121
Hey, anybody check that
rock house over there?

225
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,756
We knocked. No answer.

226
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:12,592
For Christ's sake.

227
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:25,638
Hey, Vic, wait a minute. I
just got my job back, okay?

228
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,540
I'm not breaking into this place.

229
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:36,349
There's a citizen inside here in
need of immediate medical attention.

230
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:44,857
See? Medical emergency. Somebody
get this man an aspirin.

231
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,760
Rise and shine, party people.

232
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,430
Yo, dude, this is my crib.

233
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:02,341
A cop's wife and kid across the
street were murdered last night.

234
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:05,078
This looks like a good place to
round up the usual suspects.

235
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:07,647
Ain't nobody here last
night except myself.

236
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:09,215
Well, that makes you a prime suspect.

237
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:11,084
Y'all tripping for real.

238
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:16,055
I was too blind off a eight ball to
raise my hand against my fellow man.

239
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:18,624
Are you playing a game with me?

240
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:20,927
Because I know some games myself.

241
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,779
Come on, Vic.

242
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:42,715
Okay.

243
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:48,988
This slanger, Darontay, came by
here last night to make a delivery.

244
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:54,293
He sees that bitch outside writing
down his goddamn license plate.

245
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:56,395
Darontay goes out to regulate.

246
00:14:56,395 --> 00:15:00,133
Tells her to get ghost or
be swarmed on by a nigga.

247
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:02,602
- What happened then?
- I don't know, man.

248
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:04,370
When homes came with the product...

249
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,039
...I was too busy trying
to get my smoke on.

250
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:17,817
If Tommy's wife wrote down this guy's
license, maybe it's inside the house.

251
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:21,554
Look, I think I saw some kind of
list on the fridge. I'm not sure.

252
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:23,256
Okay. Here's what we do.

253
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,592
I need another quick look inside.

254
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,028
I got a call that Captain
Griggs is on the move.

255
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:31,764
Come on, man, I'm just
trying to lend a hand here.

256
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,599
Then turn around and walk away.

257
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,635
I thought we were working
on the same team.

258
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:38,404
I don't know what this beef
between our captains is...

259
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,306
You want me to break it down for you?

260
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:43,543
No. I just want you out of
here before mine shows up.

261
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:48,748
All right, I'm out of here.

262
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:53,419
Plate numbers. I figure the
last one belongs to Darontay.

263
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:56,989
- Copy the last few to be safe.
- Gonna turn that over to Wilshire?

264
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:59,859
- After we run the numbers. Why?
- It's their investigation.

265
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:01,894
They're focusing on the wrong guy.

266
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:06,332
Wait a minute. Breaking and entering?
Withholding evidence?

267
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:09,402
If the perp fences the stuff
he stole before we get him...

268
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:12,438
...it'll be harder to tie him to
the case. We gotta get him now.

269
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:15,141
I signed to keep Tommy out
of jail, not put myself in.

270
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:17,944
Please. We're just doing the
job they should be doing.

271
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:24,550
- Julien, come on, let's go.
- I'm gonna see this through.

272
00:16:28,054 --> 00:16:29,622
We're on patrol.

273
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:30,756
It's not like I haven't
covered for you...

274
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:33,025
...for a couple of hours when
you've had an emergency.

275
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,529
- You got the numbers?
- Yeah.

276
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:40,600
Feel free to return
the list to Wilshire.

277
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,741
There was another
break-in last month.

278
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:51,077
- She tell you about that?
- She told me.

279
00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:52,411
Same as last night.

280
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:56,716
Came in through the same window,
stole a bunch of valuables.

281
00:16:56,716 --> 00:17:00,386
- Luckily no one was home at the time.
- Why not look for a break-in guy?

282
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:04,991
Not a very good neighborhood for a mom
and kid to be living alone, is it?

283
00:17:04,991 --> 00:17:09,562
It's shit. I tried to get Barb to
move, but she likes the house.

284
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:11,998
I don't make enough cash
for something better.

285
00:17:11,998 --> 00:17:13,299
You fought?

286
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:16,135
So they argued. She's an ex-wife.
Comes with the territory.

287
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:18,838
Divorce was final two
weeks ago, right?

288
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:20,373
What's that to do with anything?

289
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:21,707
Like you said,...

290
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:24,343
...it's tough to get a house in
the Hills on a uniform's alimony.

291
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:26,145
Why the hell is that important?

292
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:29,882
- We're here to discuss last night.
- Am I interrogating you or him?

293
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:34,220
I thought we were just talking.

294
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,923
I reconned three victims'
homes last night...

295
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:39,358
...all with windows
facing the street.

296
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:41,928
Tried to get a look inside.

297
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:44,330
Drapes were closed in
all three instances.

298
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,800
- I can't wait to hear the punch line.
- I reinterviewed the victims.

299
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,603
Before the attacks, all had their
drapes up during the day...

300
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:53,139
...but closed at night. So?

301
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:56,642
He's scoping them out during the day.
Unemployed?

302
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:59,345
Be less conspicuous if
he worked in the area.

303
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:03,950
A courier, construction, someone
you wouldn't look at twice.

304
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,952
How's it going up there?

305
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:09,755
You guys any closer to a suspect
or are you just $2500 poorer?

306
00:18:11,057 --> 00:18:14,961
We're gonna need daily surveillance
patrols in areas of potential attacks.

307
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:16,896
Save it till after the
press conference.

308
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:18,097
I've got my notes.

309
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,933
No, keep them. You're
gonna be doing it.

310
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,770
The press conference?
You always do those.

311
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,872
I gotta get back up to Tommy.

312
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:29,008
I still think this is premature.

313
00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:32,011
We should release a psych profile,
see if it gets us any tips.

314
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:33,346
What's the profile?

315
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:35,614
Single, or with a
submissive partner...

316
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,817
...frees him up for
going out at all hours.

317
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:42,688
No. Enough of the profiles.
Just give them what we know.

318
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,559
<i>I need you to run a plate.</i>

319
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,729
One-zero-zero-Paul-Charles-Edward.

320
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:53,099
Should come back to an
owner, first name Darontay.

321
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:56,702
Yeah, I need an address ASAP.

322
00:18:56,702 --> 00:19:00,139
Hey, I hit that check-cashing place.

323
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:04,043
Palmed the numbers
Treasury's watching.

324
00:19:04,043 --> 00:19:05,978
Everything's under control here.

325
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,280
<i>- What, you can't talk?
</i>- Right.

326
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,218
Soon as we're done, me and the guys
will check our cash against that list.

327
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:17,590
We don't know if your Cl's
information is correct.

328
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:21,327
His info may not jive with
Aceveda's expectation.

329
00:19:22,128 --> 00:19:24,530
Aceveda's working off
a different list?

330
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,898
Correct.

331
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:27,600
You need to review the evidence...

332
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,336
...collected in the Byz
Lats investigation.

333
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,905
Check it against the bills we
know are marked in Property.

334
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,807
There you go.

335
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:36,642
Hey, Cacuzza.

336
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:39,678
I could use a little help on
this Byz Lat investigation.

337
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:44,417
There was some cash logged into
Property, last name Salcido.

338
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:47,119
Can't release property without
the owner's signature.

339
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,687
Doesn't need to leave the room.

340
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:51,557
Drug residue on those bills gets
me the search warrant I need.

341
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:56,028
All right.

342
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:07,106
Here it is, the marked bills
we're holding for Treasury.

343
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:08,908
Great.

344
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,112
You haven't been back at
the house since you left?

345
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:20,386
Picked up Jeff a few
times outside the house.

346
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,521
That's the only reason,
to pick up Jeff?

347
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:25,191
- You heard him.
- Jesus Christ.

348
00:20:25,191 --> 00:20:28,928
The thing is, one of the few items...

349
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:32,131
...that was stolen last
month in the break-in...

350
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:36,302
...was an American Eagle coin
collection from your father.

351
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:37,837
We talked to Barb's sister.

352
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:40,973
She said your son saw the coins
last week at your place.

353
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:46,045
He told his mom.

354
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:47,446
She said she was gonna
press charges...

355
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:50,516
...breaking and entering. That
would have cost you your job.

356
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,988
Tommy?

357
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:01,927
- Somebody made a mistake.
- Yeah? What's your son, a liar?

358
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:06,132
My son's dead, and you
pricks won't let me see him.

359
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,383
- Captain.
- Steve.

360
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:26,819
What's going on, David?
Why isn't he in custody?

361
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:29,388
Well, you said just a
few routine questions.

362
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:32,391
There is a case. I'm not obliged
to lay it out in front of him.

363
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:34,493
Why don't you lay it
out in front of me?

364
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:37,596
Okay. He breaks into
his ex-wife's house.

365
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:41,267
Stole property, she found out.
He kills her to cover it up.

366
00:21:41,267 --> 00:21:43,269
The son sees it, so he kills him too.

367
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:47,540
Well, you've got nothing to support
that. So why don't you just let it go?

368
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:50,409
So if I search his place, I'm
not gonna find those coins?

369
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:53,012
Steve, you know you don't have
enough for a search warrant.

370
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:57,216
Are you still working with us...

371
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:00,419
...or are you a defence attorney now?

372
00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:03,289
Cuff him, put him in the car.

373
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:05,858
No, he stays in my house
until you show me more.

374
00:22:09,228 --> 00:22:10,596
Let's call the chief.

375
00:22:11,597 --> 00:22:16,502
Sure. Yeah. I think he's on the
tenth hole at Rancho Park.

376
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:17,736
I'll make sure to tell him what...

377
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:20,206
...a great job the Decoy
Squad's doing for me.

378
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:23,776
Or you can finish up with Tommy here.

379
00:22:30,216 --> 00:22:32,351
Next time, I won't knock so hard.

380
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:37,389
Put your clothes on, walk out the
door, and change your taste in men.

381
00:22:41,427 --> 00:22:45,831
- Where were you last night, playboy?
- You know, ruling the streets.

382
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:49,568
Then back to the crib for a
little thug passion with shorty.

383
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:51,203
There was a double homicide...

384
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:54,073
...right down the block from
the crack house you supply.

385
00:22:54,073 --> 00:22:57,109
Police officer's wife and
child were stabbed to death.

386
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:58,477
See me crying?

387
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,847
Well, we only just got here.

388
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:03,115
Did you do it?

389
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:06,051
I would have, but I
had on a new suit.

390
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,454
You wear that around your
neck and you talk like that?

391
00:23:08,454 --> 00:23:12,124
You like the bling-bling.
Twenty-five grand.

392
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,794
Yo, why you tripping, nigga?

393
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:18,330
Two less blue-eyed
devils in this world.

394
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:24,203
Witnesses saw you arguing last night.

395
00:23:24,203 --> 00:23:27,640
Who didn't have words with that bitch?
Telling folks to come correct...

396
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,476
...or get dimed on because
her baby daddy five-0.

397
00:23:30,476 --> 00:23:33,312
Hell, even your boy couldn't deal.

398
00:23:33,312 --> 00:23:35,714
Hired a straight G to
come gank his own crib.

399
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:38,317
No speak Ebonics, shithead.

400
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:43,756
Her old man hired some dude to
come rob his own damn house.

401
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,193
How do you know?

402
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:50,362
My users tell me
things of interest...

403
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:53,799
...Like when a fellow smoke hound
gets recruited by the po-po.

404
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:59,738
- Who'd this cop hire?
- Some smoker.

405
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:01,740
Probably wasn't a wise choice.

406
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:17,556
You hired someone to
knock over your house?

407
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:19,725
- No.
- Cut the bullshit, Tommy.

408
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:21,493
I found out.

409
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:25,397
Now, we got about two minutes tops.
Tell me what happened.

410
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:31,103
I have a coin collection from my dad.
Gold American Eagles.

411
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:33,772
She got half of them in the
settlement. She was gonna sell them.

412
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,942
So you hired someone
to steal them back?

413
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:38,977
It was a one-time thing.

414
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:43,182
Christ. You know, a bunch of us are
out there trying to clear your name.

415
00:24:43,182 --> 00:24:45,050
You're making us all
look like assholes.

416
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:48,253
He was a 459 suspect I
cut loose who owed me.

417
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:49,922
Nothing to do with last night.

418
00:24:49,922 --> 00:24:53,258
He came through the same
window, the same broken lock.

419
00:24:57,563 --> 00:24:59,631
Ex-wives know how to push buttons.

420
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:03,302
One way of getting out
from under the alimony.

421
00:25:03,302 --> 00:25:06,472
My son, Vic? You think I would
do this to him? You got kids.

422
00:25:06,472 --> 00:25:10,576
Yeah. I wouldn't hire some crackhead
to break into where they sleep.

423
00:25:10,576 --> 00:25:13,379
Barb and Jeff were out of town.
He wasn't a crackhead.

424
00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:15,647
What, did you make him
take a urine test?

425
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:20,285
This guy came back for
seconds, killed them both.

426
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:21,854
Jesus Christ.

427
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:24,890
- I gotta find him.
- That's what I'm doing.

428
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,291
Tell me his name.

429
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:28,494
Hey, unlock this door.

430
00:25:28,494 --> 00:25:32,030
Soren Arnovic. All right, run
his priors, you'll find him.

431
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,634
I didn't know, Vic. If he
did this, I didn't know.

432
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:40,072
Keep your mouth shut.
Let me do my thing.

433
00:25:40,072 --> 00:25:42,007
I said unlock this door.

434
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:47,880
What's going on?

435
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:51,417
Just showing a fellow
officer some support.

436
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:04,063
The rapes appear to be
preferentially-motivated assaults.

437
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:06,666
Can you put that in terms
our viewers can understand?

438
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:09,769
Yes. Women, between the ages...

439
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:13,673
...of 65 and 80, living alone.

440
00:26:13,673 --> 00:26:17,176
The perpetrator, rapist...

441
00:26:17,176 --> 00:26:20,346
...watches for women to leave the
house, enters, and waits for them.

442
00:26:20,346 --> 00:26:23,749
If you live in the area, keep
your blinds drawn at all times...

443
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:26,819
...because he scopes out his
victims during the day.

444
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:33,025
We believe he's a white or
Latino male, aged 25 to 40.

445
00:26:33,025 --> 00:26:34,560
That's three-quarters
of the population.

446
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,029
You don't have any hard suspects?

447
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:40,032
We're making progress
with our investigation.

448
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:41,634
Sounds like you have nothing.

449
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:47,640
We know he thinks of himself
as a sophisticated predator.

450
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:51,544
But really he has low intelligence
and poor interpersonal skills.

451
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:55,214
Probably in a menial
job or unemployed.

452
00:26:55,214 --> 00:26:57,283
It's doubtful that he has a woman.

453
00:26:57,283 --> 00:27:00,319
If he does, he's domineering and
can come and go as he pleases.

454
00:27:02,688 --> 00:27:06,525
And he struggles with impotence.
Thank you, that's all.

455
00:27:06,525 --> 00:27:09,195
- One more question, detective.
- I'm sorry. No.

456
00:27:10,196 --> 00:27:11,597
Impotence?

457
00:27:11,597 --> 00:27:14,367
I said he struggles with impotence.
He never ejaculates.

458
00:27:14,367 --> 00:27:16,902
- Dutch.
- It's a solid tactic.

459
00:27:16,902 --> 00:27:20,573
Emasculate him in public, you draw
him out or you defuse his impulses.

460
00:27:20,573 --> 00:27:24,210
Or piss him off. What if he uses
this as an excuse to rape again?

461
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,678
He's raped five women
that we know of.

462
00:27:25,678 --> 00:27:27,179
He doesn't need an excuse.

463
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:32,718
Ran those bills from Evidence. They're
not showing up on the Treasury list.

464
00:27:32,718 --> 00:27:34,720
Aceveda's working off
a different list?

465
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,789
The question is how to flush it.

466
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:38,958
- Hey.
- I got an address.

467
00:27:38,958 --> 00:27:42,294
All right. Meet back here after
you're done. We'll get into it.

468
00:27:45,898 --> 00:27:48,701
Hear Tommy might not be as
clean as we'd like to think.

469
00:27:48,701 --> 00:27:50,836
Think what you want to.

470
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:53,172
We gotta get back on patrol.

471
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:55,441
What would you say if it was
you in lnterrogation...

472
00:27:55,441 --> 00:27:59,979
- ...for two murders you didn't do?
- Look, I'm not taking another fall.

473
00:27:59,979 --> 00:28:02,648
You guys go back out there,
I gotta go to Aceveda.

474
00:28:05,651 --> 00:28:07,019
Let's go.

475
00:28:09,255 --> 00:28:10,756
Tell us about the coins.

476
00:28:13,926 --> 00:28:16,629
I got guys at your
apartment right now.

477
00:28:16,629 --> 00:28:18,164
They gonna find them?

478
00:28:20,766 --> 00:28:25,871
According to the divorce settlement,
they belonged to Barb, right, Tommy?

479
00:28:26,639 --> 00:28:30,443
- Part of the division of property?
- I wanna see my lawyer.

480
00:28:30,443 --> 00:28:32,311
You helping us or trying
to hide something?

481
00:28:33,512 --> 00:28:35,548
Did you have anything
to do with the robbery?

482
00:28:36,916 --> 00:28:39,852
Let me see my son or get me a lawyer.

483
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:44,890
A lawyer? Not a PBA rep?

484
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,398
You can take him.

485
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:02,174
Let's go, buddy. Stand up.

486
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,717
Three assaults on gay hustlers in the
last month, all on Saturday nights.

487
00:29:11,717 --> 00:29:14,587
- Victims give us anything?
- Besides big sad eyes?

488
00:29:14,587 --> 00:29:16,922
Descriptions are all over the
place, but the M.O. tracks.

489
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:19,391
Four to five guys
grabbing for trick money.

490
00:29:19,391 --> 00:29:21,727
We're shutting down Vice
in Farmington, right?

491
00:29:21,727 --> 00:29:23,963
- That's the job.
- So if I'm a cocksucker...

492
00:29:23,963 --> 00:29:25,164
What do you mean "if"?

493
00:29:25,164 --> 00:29:27,333
...and shit goes down in my place...

494
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:29,935
...don't I just take my
mouth someplace else?

495
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:31,137
You may find it trivial...

496
00:29:31,137 --> 00:29:34,507
...but two victims ended up in
ICU, one with a fractured skull.

497
00:29:34,507 --> 00:29:37,843
Shane, you'll be undercover.
Everyone else maintains a perimeter.

498
00:29:37,843 --> 00:29:41,313
Hold the phone there, doll face.
You got me on salami patrol? No.

499
00:29:41,313 --> 00:29:44,984
- What about one of these guys?
- They don't look gay enough.

500
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,322
Shane, when you want
your buddy to release...

501
00:29:50,322 --> 00:29:53,325
...gently squeeze the
shaft at the base...

502
00:29:53,325 --> 00:29:55,761
...applying tongue to
the glans and frenulum.

503
00:29:56,529 --> 00:29:57,897
Hey, tube-steak...

504
00:29:57,897 --> 00:30:01,200
...I'm engaged to a gorgeous
female who's carrying my child.

505
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,802
You're the one who actually
knows the names of xxxx parts.

506
00:30:04,703 --> 00:30:06,972
You must be the undercover
police officer.

507
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:08,541
I'm glad to be of service.

508
00:30:08,541 --> 00:30:10,009
<i>- Thanks.
</i>- For what?

509
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:13,045
For watching our backs. It's
been the mama of drama here.

510
00:30:13,045 --> 00:30:15,014
You might wanna hold
off on the thanks.

511
00:30:15,014 --> 00:30:17,416
More than likely, I'll be
running you in next week.

512
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,487
I didn't get your name.

513
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,089
Yeah.

514
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:33,299
I got a call. Guy claiming
to be the rapist.

515
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:36,735
He's demanding a formal statement
retracting the impotence charge.

516
00:30:36,735 --> 00:30:38,103
So he's made contact.

517
00:30:38,103 --> 00:30:41,207
We've had over 100 calls.
It could be a hoax.

518
00:30:41,207 --> 00:30:45,010
Well, he said he took a figurine
from the last victim's house.

519
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:47,246
Could say you take a figurine
from an old woman's house...

520
00:30:47,246 --> 00:30:50,182
...and have a nine out of
10 shot at being right.

521
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:51,650
He says it was a Hummel.

522
00:30:57,323 --> 00:31:00,659
Danny's not gonna say anything.
She wouldn't do that to me.

523
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:02,962
She sure as hell isn't
gonna do it to you.

524
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:09,535
Listen, we find this guy, after what
he did, we don't take any chances.

525
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:13,939
He resists, he reaches for a piece, he
lifts a finger, we use deadly force.

526
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:19,578
Not gonna give him a chance
to hurt us. Or Tommy.

527
00:31:25,851 --> 00:31:28,287
- Sir?
- What is it?

528
00:31:30,923 --> 00:31:33,058
Our deal was if I saw something...?

529
00:31:33,592 --> 00:31:34,893
What happened?

530
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:41,600
Vic rounded up some guys to track
down who killed Tommy's family.

531
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,402
I was one of them. I mean,
just to make sure...

532
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:45,537
...Tommy was getting a fair shake.

533
00:31:45,537 --> 00:31:47,473
- But now?
- But now...

534
00:31:47,473 --> 00:31:50,843
...it's gone from a fact-checking
mission into a foxhunt.

535
00:31:52,511 --> 00:31:54,813
- And who's with him?
- Julien.

536
00:31:55,881 --> 00:32:00,719
- You let this happen?
- Well, I'm not his TO anymore, am l?

537
00:32:00,719 --> 00:32:02,988
Obviously, Julien is
responsible for himself.

538
00:32:02,988 --> 00:32:06,058
I thought you had some
influence over the guy.

539
00:32:08,494 --> 00:32:09,995
Okay.

540
00:32:12,631 --> 00:32:16,602
Six-Paul-1 1 requesting
backup at 95 Round Hill Road.

541
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:18,437
Possible 1 87 suspect.

542
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:20,572
All right, you take the front.

543
00:32:20,572 --> 00:32:23,809
He sees the uniform,
he runs, he did it.

544
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:25,411
I'll take the back.

545
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:31,083
Hey, hey. No chances.

546
00:32:42,528 --> 00:32:44,129
Police!

547
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:45,898
He's got a gun!

548
00:32:45,898 --> 00:32:47,599
He's running! Police!

549
00:32:56,775 --> 00:32:58,944
He's still got the gun.

550
00:32:58,944 --> 00:33:00,412
Couldn't get a good shot.

551
00:33:01,513 --> 00:33:03,816
Go out front, wait for backup.

552
00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:09,488
Don't come near me.

553
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:12,991
When he calls, tell him the only way
the public's gonna hear his story...

554
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,828
...is for him to come
forward and tell the truth.

555
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:18,597
- What if he doesn't call?
- He's gonna wanna hear our answer.

556
00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:22,501
You think he'll give it all up just
to make it clear he's not impotent?

557
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:26,205
- Why would he do that?
- Because he's mentally ill.

558
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:32,044
Don't come near me.

559
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:39,585
Thing I couldn't take
about prison, the stink.

560
00:33:39,585 --> 00:33:42,154
Piss, shit....

561
00:33:42,154 --> 00:33:46,058
You're looking at 10 years of that
before they hit you with the needle.

562
00:33:46,058 --> 00:33:49,962
The worst part? Can't fix
up when you're hurting.

563
00:33:51,263 --> 00:33:53,599
Sometimes you can't fix at all.

564
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:55,234
- Shut up.
- Me?

565
00:33:56,168 --> 00:33:58,237
I'd eat a bullet right now.

566
00:33:59,004 --> 00:34:00,806
Backup's two minutes out.

567
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,643
You got two minutes before
the cavalry gets here.

568
00:34:06,412 --> 00:34:07,980
You think it over.

569
00:34:23,629 --> 00:34:27,466
Suspect who killed Tommy Hisk's family. Saw
the stolen property in the house.

570
00:34:27,466 --> 00:34:29,569
Vic's trying to get him to come out.

571
00:34:29,569 --> 00:34:31,337
Hope he doesn't try too hard.

572
00:34:33,906 --> 00:34:39,245
Stick the gun in your mouth and pull.
Last chance. Do it, Soren.

573
00:34:42,682 --> 00:34:44,250
Don't shoot!

574
00:34:45,351 --> 00:34:48,020
Please, don't shoot.

575
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:56,462
Put your hands behind your head.

576
00:34:59,498 --> 00:35:00,967
Turn around.

577
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,038
Take him.

578
00:35:09,175 --> 00:35:10,543
Come here.

579
00:35:12,044 --> 00:35:13,579
Behind your back.

580
00:35:23,522 --> 00:35:27,326
- Check out the wheels.
- Chrome 22s, sweet.

581
00:35:27,326 --> 00:35:29,562
- How much do you think?
- I don't know.

582
00:35:29,562 --> 00:35:31,063
Couple of night's work.

583
00:35:33,099 --> 00:35:38,537
Set of Kruz Laguna chrome
22s, run you around 3200.

584
00:35:38,537 --> 00:35:40,806
Throw in another grand
for the spinners.

585
00:35:40,806 --> 00:35:43,809
Looks like our breeder knows a
thing or two about rim jobs.

586
00:35:44,377 --> 00:35:46,078
Rim jobs.

587
00:35:46,078 --> 00:35:50,082
<i>In front of the camera, so the
</i>cops can't do nothing to me.

588
00:35:50,082 --> 00:35:51,784
<i>I can arrange that.</i>

589
00:35:51,784 --> 00:35:55,655
<i>I'll say what I gotta say, but
</i>he's gotta take back what he said.

590
00:35:55,655 --> 00:35:59,091
<i>No one there except you, me and him.</i>

591
00:35:59,091 --> 00:36:03,095
<i>-  You mean Detective Wagenbach?
</i>- He needs to apologize.

592
00:36:05,031 --> 00:36:07,300
I'm putting one of my
men in with the camera.

593
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:10,169
No, not unless you know someone
who can run a Sony D600.

594
00:36:10,169 --> 00:36:12,538
You get the arrest, we get the video.

595
00:36:12,538 --> 00:36:14,040
I've done this dozens of times.

596
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:17,710
My camera guy was in the middle of
Baghdad when Desert Storm started.

597
00:36:19,312 --> 00:36:21,681
I want at least two guys
in close proximity.

598
00:36:22,415 --> 00:36:23,582
I can handle him.

599
00:36:23,582 --> 00:36:26,552
Three backup teams
with radio contact...

600
00:36:26,552 --> 00:36:29,355
...and everyone's wearing a
vest or you get no video.

601
00:36:30,923 --> 00:36:33,626
<i>Back home, I had a Chevy 1500.</i>

602
00:36:33,626 --> 00:36:36,028
Four-barrel carb on a high-rise.

603
00:36:36,829 --> 00:36:39,098
Slapped them paddle
tires on every summer.

604
00:36:39,098 --> 00:36:41,701
Sand-dragged the shit out of it.

605
00:36:41,701 --> 00:36:44,503
I had an F-1 50 with a NOS system...

606
00:36:44,503 --> 00:36:47,073
...so the nitrous shot
straight into the manifold.

607
00:36:47,073 --> 00:36:49,041
My brother did that
to a Dodge short bed.

608
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:50,943
- It's a bad move.
- No shit.

609
00:36:50,943 --> 00:36:53,779
Threw a rod, sent it
sideways, tires smoked.

610
00:36:53,779 --> 00:36:56,382
Junked the whole engine, Yeah.

611
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:59,719
- Hey, faggot.
- Hey, come here, punk.

612
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:01,687
Yeah, come on. Come on.

613
00:37:01,687 --> 00:37:03,155
Move!

614
00:37:04,023 --> 00:37:05,791
Police officer!

615
00:37:05,791 --> 00:37:08,094
Drop the bat! Drop the bat right now!

616
00:37:08,094 --> 00:37:10,062
Police. Stop right there.
Turn around.

617
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:12,531
- You, on the ground! On the ground!
- Turn around.

618
00:37:12,531 --> 00:37:14,233
Turn around. Get over here.

619
00:37:14,233 --> 00:37:16,168
Get over here. Against the wall.

620
00:37:16,168 --> 00:37:18,237
This way. This way.

621
00:37:18,237 --> 00:37:19,805
Stop right there!

622
00:37:21,674 --> 00:37:23,109
Nice tackle.

623
00:37:27,246 --> 00:37:28,447
What's this?

624
00:37:28,447 --> 00:37:30,983
The collar you and me have
been working on all day.

625
00:37:30,983 --> 00:37:33,452
Right. We're good.

626
00:37:33,452 --> 00:37:36,622
DA says this case has got the
makings of a hate crime.

627
00:37:36,622 --> 00:37:38,624
But they were also
in it for the money.

628
00:37:38,624 --> 00:37:41,160
- Got a confession out of one.
- Spilled his guts.

629
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:45,598
Football players. They knock back a
few and look for queers to beat up.

630
00:37:45,598 --> 00:37:48,467
Rip them off for their trick
money to pay the bar tab.

631
00:37:48,467 --> 00:37:50,369
How'd the Strike Team do?

632
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:54,173
Fine. That one's a natural
born undercover come-guzzler.

633
00:37:54,173 --> 00:37:55,674
I heard that, bitch.

634
00:38:01,313 --> 00:38:02,848
You went off the grid today?

635
00:38:06,018 --> 00:38:07,486
Who told you that?

636
00:38:15,361 --> 00:38:17,196
I knew Tommy didn't do it.

637
00:38:17,196 --> 00:38:20,533
Didn't like that Griggs asshole
trying to prove otherwise.

638
00:38:21,901 --> 00:38:25,571
Today was a one-time thing. Got it?

639
00:38:25,571 --> 00:38:26,772
Got it.

640
00:38:28,107 --> 00:38:30,743
You weren't at the
basher sting tonight?

641
00:38:30,743 --> 00:38:34,246
I was there in spirit.
Busts got made.

642
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:44,256
You never disappeared for a couple
of hours to help another cop?

643
00:38:50,329 --> 00:38:53,632
You look like hell. Is
everything else all right?

644
00:38:56,435 --> 00:38:58,370
Long day, that's all.

645
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:05,744
I replaced the gasket on the filter.
It's working just fine again.

646
00:39:05,744 --> 00:39:07,246
Thanks for doing that.

647
00:39:09,715 --> 00:39:12,485
- Matt having another session?
- Not tonight.

648
00:39:15,421 --> 00:39:17,490
Owen's here a lot lately, isn't he?

649
00:39:18,224 --> 00:39:19,825
Matthew's improving.

650
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,097
- Something you want to tell me?
- About what?

651
00:39:25,731 --> 00:39:27,133
About you and Owen.

652
00:39:28,767 --> 00:39:31,837
- Did Cassidy say something?
- No.

653
00:39:33,172 --> 00:39:36,041
You walked by in your panties
without batting an eye...

654
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:37,610
...that he was just inside.

655
00:39:40,246 --> 00:39:41,614
I don't have to discuss
this with you.

656
00:39:41,614 --> 00:39:42,815
Yes, you do.

657
00:39:44,517 --> 00:39:46,952
I want him the hell
away from Matthew.

658
00:39:46,952 --> 00:39:49,755
- He's not his father.
- No, but he's here for him.

659
00:39:49,755 --> 00:39:51,557
I'm not shelling out my own money...

660
00:39:51,557 --> 00:39:55,528
...so that the hired help can
play daddy to impress you.

661
00:39:55,528 --> 00:39:58,330
- Get rid of him.
- He's an amazing teacher...

662
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:01,634
...and that's what you pay for.
Anything else is my business.

663
00:40:01,634 --> 00:40:03,602
You know he has a record?

664
00:40:03,602 --> 00:40:06,906
- He got busted for weed in college.
- You've been checking up on him?

665
00:40:06,906 --> 00:40:09,708
Damn straight. He's
alone with my son.

666
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:14,180
So he smoked a joint 15 years ago.

667
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:16,582
It wasn't possession.
It was for dealing.

668
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:20,886
It couldn't have been that serious
if he got his teaching certificate.

669
00:40:22,955 --> 00:40:26,225
You date who you want,
but he's out of a job.

670
00:40:43,676 --> 00:40:48,347
Talked to a buddy over at Wilshire.
Arnovic's given a full confession.

671
00:40:48,347 --> 00:40:50,183
- Good.
- Not good.

672
00:40:50,183 --> 00:40:51,884
He's telling about how Tommy...

673
00:40:51,884 --> 00:40:54,253
...had him break into his
ex's house last month.

674
00:40:54,887 --> 00:40:57,857
- What's that gonna mean for him?
- Probably his job.

675
00:41:01,227 --> 00:41:02,862
I didn't have a shot.

676
00:41:05,465 --> 00:41:06,666
I know.

677
00:41:10,203 --> 00:41:13,873
Did the right thing riding with me
today. People saw you stepped up.

678
00:41:17,577 --> 00:41:20,480
I'm going to church tonight.
I'll say a prayer for him.

679
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,381
For his wife and kid.

680
00:41:23,616 --> 00:41:25,318
Say one for all of us.

681
00:41:30,523 --> 00:41:33,226
It's now four hours past the
designated surrender time...

682
00:41:33,226 --> 00:41:36,129
...of the alleged rapist
terrorizing elderly women...

683
00:41:36,129 --> 00:41:38,364
...in the Farmington
District of Los Angeles.

684
00:41:38,364 --> 00:41:42,869
Is he sending a message that it's
your department who is impotent?

685
00:41:42,869 --> 00:41:45,872
You may as well turn this off,
because it's never gonna air.

686
00:41:52,678 --> 00:41:53,780
We're chasing our tails.

687
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:56,182
We'd be better off if the
money train never happened.

688
00:41:56,182 --> 00:41:58,851
- Give me a break.
- Calm down, girls.

689
00:41:58,851 --> 00:42:01,854
Now, we know Treasury's got
Aceveda checking bills...

690
00:42:01,854 --> 00:42:04,757
- ...on any bust over a grand.
- So?

691
00:42:04,757 --> 00:42:08,161
One of the uni's just logged
two large into Evidence.

692
00:42:08,161 --> 00:42:10,196
We don't let that money
out of our sight...

693
00:42:10,196 --> 00:42:12,198
...we'll find the list
he's working with.

694
00:42:17,036 --> 00:42:19,539
Here's your phone list and
your schedule for tomorrow.

695
00:42:21,107 --> 00:42:24,377
- Did you call Aurora back?
- Not yet.

696
00:42:24,377 --> 00:42:28,114
- You really should.
- I'll do it when I do it.

697
00:42:28,114 --> 00:42:31,450
- What?
- Something's bothering you.

698
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:35,021
- lf it's anything that I did...
- It's not, Nina.

699
00:42:35,021 --> 00:42:38,357
Please, just check the bills in
Evidence like I asked you to.

700
00:43:15,194 --> 00:43:17,163
- What do you need?
- Shane forgot...

701
00:43:17,163 --> 00:43:20,032
...to sign that evidence
envelope from that 211.

702
00:43:20,032 --> 00:43:24,203
- No, he signed it.
- All right. Great. I'll let him know.

703
00:43:31,744 --> 00:43:34,680
- He was never coming.
- No.

704
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:37,650
I embarrassed him, he
wanted to embarrass me.

705
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:39,619
Probably.

706
00:43:39,619 --> 00:43:42,321
He's more self-controlled
than I gave him credit for.

707
00:43:44,156 --> 00:43:47,193
We still got some time before
we have to get back to work.

708
00:43:47,193 --> 00:43:50,096
- You could buy me breakfast.
- I'm broke.

709
00:43:56,969 --> 00:44:02,675
We know where he
lives, where he hunts.

710
00:44:03,542 --> 00:44:05,578
Now we've got him on tape.

711
00:44:05,578 --> 00:44:11,050
Voice analysis will tell us his
ethnicity, personality traits.

712
00:44:12,285 --> 00:44:14,153
We're getting to know him.

713
00:44:16,489 --> 00:44:18,090
I was wrong.

714
00:44:19,325 --> 00:44:20,893
You were right.

715
00:44:23,062 --> 00:44:24,530
Maybe a little.

716
00:44:25,831 --> 00:44:27,199
Come on.

717
00:44:28,134 --> 00:44:29,635
I'm buying.

718
00:44:34,707 --> 00:44:38,611
Hey, Nina. Could you help with the
computer in the briefing room?

719
00:44:38,611 --> 00:44:40,212
It's not taking my access code.

720
00:44:40,212 --> 00:44:43,282
- I can't right now.
- It's really kind of urgent.

721
00:44:43,282 --> 00:44:45,051
I'm trying to access this database.

722
00:44:45,051 --> 00:44:47,520
I'm working on something for David.
Sorry.

723
00:45:00,399 --> 00:45:02,969
- Thank you.
- Have a good night.

724
00:45:11,243 --> 00:45:12,578
Close it.

725
00:45:13,913 --> 00:45:15,414
List's in Aceveda's safe.

726
00:45:16,615 --> 00:45:18,684
- Well, so that's it.
- Not necessarily.

727
00:45:18,684 --> 00:45:20,853
What do you mean?

728
00:45:20,853 --> 00:45:23,322
Ripping off the money train was
10 times more complicated.

729
00:45:23,322 --> 00:45:27,360
It's in a safe, in a captain's
office, inside of a police station.

730
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:30,129
Without that list, none of
that money is any good.

731
00:45:35,301 --> 00:45:37,103
Yeah.

732
00:45:37,603 --> 00:45:39,238
Gotta be a way.
