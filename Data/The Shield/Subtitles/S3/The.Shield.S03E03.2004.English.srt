1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,335
<i>Previously on "The Shield".</i>

2
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:04,537
Known this girl for two months,
you're buying a new car?

3
00:00:04,537 --> 00:00:07,107
- What's the problem?
- This thing between me and Vic...

4
00:00:07,107 --> 00:00:08,908
Sometimes brothers fight.

5
00:00:08,908 --> 00:00:10,877
So why is he always making
you the little brother?

6
00:00:10,877 --> 00:00:12,946
Did I do something to piss you off?

7
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:14,381
I don't like the way you treat Shane.

8
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:16,383
You don't understand the world
that Shane and I live in.

9
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:19,286
Shane works for you, but
he comes home to me.

10
00:00:19,286 --> 00:00:23,456
You said you had a few ideas
about adding personnel?

11
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:26,359
The undercover Decoy
Squad working Wilshire.

12
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:29,462
I need someone overseeing the
practical elements of my plan.

13
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:30,864
Your plan?

14
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:33,800
David's bringing in the
Decoy Squad from Wilshire.

15
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,237
They're gonna be working with you.
I'm gonna be in charge of both teams.

16
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:39,973
They killed these Armenians
looking for our money-train cash.

17
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:42,342
There's four people who
know we took that money.

18
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:45,045
They're all sitting right here.
Stick to the plan.

19
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,980
You need to go somewhere.

20
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,549
- You need help.
- I'll get clean.

21
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:52,419
- You can get me through it.
- Jesus Christ, Connie.

22
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:56,189
I can't be helped.

23
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,759
- You're cleaned.
- Yeah.

24
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:01,661
This is the C.I. contract.

25
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:03,563
Calm down.

26
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,098
- Jesus Christ!
- Shut up!

27
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:07,567
What the hell is the matter with you?

28
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:11,371
Vic, I'm sorry.

29
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:16,443
Yo, what's up, boss?

30
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:19,212
Seen the new 20?

31
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:22,015
- Yeah, man. The colours are funky.
- Yeah.

32
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:25,352
The old ones are gonna be phased out
of the system over the next year.

33
00:01:25,352 --> 00:01:27,320
So, what about our money-train 20s?

34
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,056
We have to unload our 20s
sooner than we wanted to...

35
00:01:30,056 --> 00:01:31,925
...before they stand out too much.

36
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,294
Shit.

37
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:37,497
So Claudette's in
charge of our team now?

38
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:41,134
- That's the way she sees it.
- You had a female boss before?

39
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:42,836
You ever met my daughter?

40
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:46,706
- She's insisting we go mini-putting.
- So how do we deal with her?

41
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,708
Kill her with kindness.

42
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:50,477
Couple of months, we'll
get our freedom back.

43
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:52,412
It's not like we can't use the break.

44
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:57,217
Catching those preppy lawyers
with their pants down.

45
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:02,155
I think you guys got the wrong room.

46
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:04,491
Wyms told us to shack up here.

47
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:06,659
We're the Decoy Squad.
We just transferred in.

48
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:11,131
- I'm Walon. Eddie, Annie, Trish.
- Vic Mackey.

49
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,067
It's crowded in here. Why
don't I talk to my captain...

50
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:16,202
...see if I can scrounge
you up some new digs?

51
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:18,438
- Seems okay to me.
- Yeah, we can make it work.

52
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:21,040
Man, what's that smell?

53
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,010
I've been playing homeless
for the last three days.

54
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,712
Kind of ripe?

55
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:29,749
- Where's the shower around here?
- First door on the left.

56
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:37,123
- Look, I need to go to work.
- Then go already.

57
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:40,059
Well, I don't wanna leave arguing.
What's the problem?

58
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:41,428
Nothing.

59
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:45,932
Look, what are you doing? This
doesn't have to be a thing.

60
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:47,267
You don't want me here.

61
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:50,937
Look, I said I thought it was a
little fast for you to be moving in.

62
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:53,506
It doesn't mean that I don't
want you here when I get home.

63
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:05,518
Shit. Hey.

64
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:11,357
- What, couldn't find the shower?
- Yeah, I found it. Thanks.

65
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,460
Where's the rest of your team?

66
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:17,230
I gave Ronnie a pass. He's seeing
a plastic surgeon about his face.

67
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:21,367
- And Shane?
- Car battery died. He'll meet us.

68
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:24,170
Okay, our first target, prostitution.

69
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:27,607
We've mapped out four
key red-light zones.

70
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:31,177
Phase one, get the girls off the
street. Phase two, nail the johns.

71
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:34,414
A temporary processing station's
been set up to expedite arrests.

72
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:37,784
Also, media crews will be filming
to discourage offenders...

73
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:40,086
...and anyone watching
from ever coming back.

74
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:42,288
The DA's office has
been helpful as well.

75
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:46,860
Members of your team can now
show their members to the girls.

76
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,530
- We get to show our dxxxs?
- Time to pull out the pipes, fellas.

77
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:54,100
It's only to convince them that
you're not law enforcement.

78
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,703
They can look, they can't touch.

79
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,372
Their loss.

80
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:04,277
- Chicken-head, 2 o'clock.
- Drive-through blowjobs.

81
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,715
- All right, I'm rolling up.
- We got you, good buddy.

82
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,087
- You looking for a date?
- It's too nice a night to be lonely.

83
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,656
- You a cop?
- I look like a cop?

84
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:19,692
Yeah. Let me see your package.

85
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:21,628
You gotta promise not
to get scared away.

86
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:24,464
- Go ahead, frighten me.
- Okay.

87
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:33,339
Halloween's early this year.
Want some candy?

88
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:37,610
Well, how do I know you're not a cop?

89
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:41,014
I am a cop. See my badge?

90
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,785
Go, brother.

91
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,720
That just made my week.

92
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,757
<i>Head's 50, sex is 75,
</i>anal's a hundred.

93
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:54,360
- Hey. Sorry.
<i>- You wanna be my backdoor baby?</i>

94
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,263
- Where the hell you been?
- Just dealing with some stuff.

95
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:59,933
Next time, pick up a phone
or at least answer yours.

96
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:02,669
<i>Hey, we got an assault in progress.
</i>You guys see that?

97
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:03,903
Lem, hit it.

98
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,213
- Police!
- I'm okay.

99
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:16,616
- Get off!
- Here. Come here.

100
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:18,751
- I got the runner.
- Get off me, you bastard!

101
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:21,354
- Freeze! Police!
- You're under arrest, princess.

102
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:24,290
All right, ladies. Easy.

103
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:26,793
- Just relax.
- My arm!

104
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,895
All right, everybody calm down.

105
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:31,331
Hey, I know you, right?

106
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:36,269
- No.
- Yeah.

107
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,705
You're the cop that was there
when Connie got killed.

108
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,008
I saw you at the funeral.
I was her friend.

109
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:44,277
You were too, right?

110
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,317
What do you want?

111
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:55,488
My pimp kicked me out on the street,
won't let anyone else take me in.

112
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:56,889
I got no protection.

113
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:59,425
Well, it looks like it's
time to relocate then...

114
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:01,060
...or find a new line of work.

115
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,996
- Please, I just...
- Sorry.

116
00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:07,066
Connie said you helped her, said
you looked out for her and Brian.

117
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:09,702
Look, Connie was just
an informant of mine.

118
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,038
So dropping her name
is doing you no good.

119
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,073
- I heard you helped her out.
- You heard wrong.

120
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:17,443
Please. You're a cop. They're
gonna kill me out there.

121
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:20,713
Do something for me.

122
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,860
I'm not gonna judge
the life you chose...

123
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,062
...but I'm not gonna get
sucked into it either.

124
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,665
Good luck.

125
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:54,648
My. You two dirty up quite nicely.

126
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:56,650
This? Just a few rags from my closet.

127
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,518
I'll give you a runway show sometime.

128
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:00,420
She's not kidding.
These are hers too.

129
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,389
All these arrests are
for solicitation?

130
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:03,690
Assault and battery.

131
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,026
Buys us an extra three to
six months off the street.

132
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:08,628
Sorry to set the bar so
high your first night.

133
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:12,165
-Well, we'll see if we can keep up.
-Thanks for coming.

134
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:14,835
Yeah, I had a flat. I got
there as quick as I could.

135
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:16,603
I told her your battery died.

136
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:21,541
It was personal. It
won't happen again.

137
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:30,016
I talked to the hooker who got jumped.
She'll build a case against her pimp.

138
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:32,719
I talked to her too. She's a liar.

139
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:34,921
Then she should fit
right in on your team.

140
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:39,693
Work with her. I've sent a
message to the gals and johns...

141
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:42,195
...and I'd like to send
one to the pimps too.

142
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:43,563
You're the boss.

143
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,939
- Thought you had that hooker sting?
- It's in motion.

144
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:56,109
I heard you got a call.
Thought I'd check in.

145
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:59,946
Victim's name is lsabel
Nelson, raped by a lone male.

146
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:02,149
Guy was waiting in the house
naked when she came home.

147
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,818
Left with jewellery, a little cash.

148
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:07,320
- Is that her?
- That's her daughter.

149
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,256
Isabel's 73.

150
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:16,563
- He had a ski mask covering his head.
- Was he black, white?

151
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:19,633
White, maybe Mexican, not black.

152
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:22,302
Do you remember anything
about his body?

153
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:25,138
Tattoos, birthmarks, anything?

154
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:26,873
All I saw was his....

155
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:31,545
And it didn't look anything
like my husband's used to look.

156
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:34,514
Well, we can talk about this later.

157
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,884
I wanna help. He shouldn't
have done this.

158
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,124
Is it true that he
didn't leave right away?

159
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:50,397
He wanted to know where my
jewellery was, and he took it.

160
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:55,168
Then he laid down on the
bed again, next to me...

161
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:58,805
...he put his hands on
me, two or three hours.

162
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:01,875
- Was he holding you down?
- No.

163
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,211
He just....

164
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,348
Cuddled with you.

165
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,118
That was the worst part.

166
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,621
It's okay. Good.

167
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:20,961
Would you stop ignoring my messages
and call me back? Okay? Please?

168
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:25,465
- Trouble in paradise.
- That's one I won't miss.

169
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:29,302
What's up?

170
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:37,444
I'm sorry I went over your head.
I didn't know she was your boss.

171
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,681
You just don't understand
how dangerous Smooth is.

172
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:45,986
I know pimps. Only thing original
about them are their names.

173
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:49,956
- Where are you from?
- San Jose.

174
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:54,661
When this is over, why don't you
take a bus, open up shop there?

175
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:56,830
I like L.A.

176
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,432
Smooth will kill you if he
finds out you helped us.

177
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,801
Not if you protect me.

178
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:06,072
Let's be clear.

179
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:09,376
This is a one-shot deal,
sweetie, then we're done.

180
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,046
The guy in the suit, what's he in on?

181
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:16,049
Solicitation. Won't give
his name, had no ID.

182
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:17,550
Nothing at all?

183
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:23,156
Ass Invader? I've been looking all
over Beverly Hills for one of those.

184
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:25,959
Somebody dropped by the store,
said, "Give me one of everything."

185
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:29,663
He has got a dildo in there
you could snake a drain with.

186
00:10:29,663 --> 00:10:32,866
I'll handle this one. Finish
the paperwork, run it by me.

187
00:10:34,534 --> 00:10:37,070
Captain's real hands-on here?

188
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:39,706
You could say that.

189
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:41,574
See anything in there
I should take home?

190
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:51,518
- How are you, David?
- Better than you, Javier.

191
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:54,888
That policewoman made a big mistake.

192
00:10:54,888 --> 00:10:57,257
I don't wanna get anybody
in trouble, but,...

193
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:00,293
...you know, she's acted out of line.

194
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:02,429
How?

195
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:04,931
She flagged me over, said
she wanted directions.

196
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:07,133
I'm not out there looking
for this, so help me.

197
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:10,537
Come on, Javier, I saw the
bag you were arrested with.

198
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:13,239
Embarrassing, it's not illegal.

199
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:16,776
- Why didn't you give your name?
- I panicked.

200
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:19,846
I'm trying to save the
district from scandal.

201
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:23,717
For God's sake, do you know
what would happen to me...

202
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:25,518
...if people think I
actually did this?

203
00:11:27,587 --> 00:11:29,055
So why cuddle?

204
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:32,292
Is that a guilt reaction or some
kind of emotional souvenir?

205
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:35,161
"Just because I raped you doesn't
mean we can't be friends"?

206
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,263
Thanks for the assignment.

207
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:39,299
- Farrah's a real winner.
- What'd she give us?

208
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:42,302
Smooth's running a glorified
whorehouse for downtown suits.

209
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:45,905
He keeps a drug stash in the house in
case his guests need a pick-me-up.

210
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:48,975
- You know, X, oxy, coke.
- I'll call for a warrant.

211
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:52,345
You see if Shane slept
through his alarm.

212
00:11:56,683 --> 00:11:58,151
All right, that's the target.

213
00:11:58,151 --> 00:11:59,753
The drug stash is in
the last bedroom.

214
00:11:59,753 --> 00:12:01,621
Tavon's got point.

215
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:04,691
- Tavon? What about me?
- You got one strike with Claudette.

216
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:07,227
If something goes wrong, I
don't want you taking a hit.

217
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:09,596
- Well, why would something go wrong?
- It won't.

218
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:13,967
- It's on.
- Okay. Give up your hardware.

219
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:16,703
Farrah says they're running clients
for metal on the way inside,...

220
00:12:16,703 --> 00:12:17,837
...so give it up.

221
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:22,342
Okay, you're not packing, so keep
it simple. Get in, get solicited.

222
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:23,977
Shane will call in the signal.

223
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:28,415
- Who's Smooth's bottom bitch?
- She's the queen whore, Cocoa.

224
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:31,818
- So how'd you hear about us?
- We came in for the car convention.

225
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:33,887
The boys from Chevy
gave me your number.

226
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:36,656
- Who do you like?
- What about you?

227
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:40,193
You can get the mouth, but
only Smooth gets my booty.

228
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:43,463
- Suck you bone-dry for a hundred.
- Hope you're worth it.

229
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:45,965
- Now, that's mine.
- Party favours?

230
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:50,069
- Coke? X? Viagra?
- I'll take some X.

231
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:55,308
And get my boy here some of that
Viagra. He can use the boost.

232
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:00,079
Follow me.

233
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:06,519
- You got a bathroom?
- Upstairs.

234
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:09,322
I'm gonna give you something
more than you bargained for.

235
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:24,270
Hey, it's a go. Two guys packing
just inside the front door.

236
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:28,074
Go. Move. Come on, move your ass.

237
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:31,077
- Go.
- Go.

238
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:34,047
- My God!
- My God!

239
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:35,615
Shit, it's reinforced.

240
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:38,184
The door is holding.
Open it from the inside.

241
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:39,452
- I got it.
- Get out of the way!

242
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:40,753
It's a raid!

243
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:43,389
- Where the hell's backup?
- Can't get in.

244
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:46,459
- Get out, girls!
- Hey, get her, man.

245
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:49,662
Let us out there!

246
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:54,033
Police! Freeze!

247
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:56,636
- Where's Tavon?
- She's flushing the drugs!

248
00:13:58,104 --> 00:14:00,373
Get down! Get out of here right now!
Get out!

249
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:03,877
- Can we get a ram in here?
- Hurry up!

250
00:14:03,877 --> 00:14:06,312
- Get the ram!
- Here, come here, come here!

251
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:08,815
Go, go!

252
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:11,417
- Too late.
- Get on your feet!

253
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:14,954
Hands on your head! Get against
the wall. Turn to the wall!

254
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:21,628
- Yes?
- I'm Detective Wagenbach.

255
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:24,497
I'm investigating a break-in
at the building next door.

256
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:26,833
- You notice anyone unusual?
- Just the police.

257
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,268
What about your family?

258
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:30,770
It's just me and my son
Josh, but he wasn't home.

259
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,505
- How old is Josh?
- Nineteen.

260
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:36,075
I'm gonna need to talk to him.
Have him give me a call.

261
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:38,545
That's my number if you
think of something else.

262
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:40,880
Should I be worried?

263
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:43,950
That was a lot of
commotion for a break-in.

264
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:47,320
Just make sure you lock up
when you're not at home.

265
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,389
Thank you. Excuse me.

266
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,491
Smooth's smarter than
we gave him credit for.

267
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:53,927
They registered his
cathouse in Cocoa's name.

268
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:56,195
Summer classes at Pimp U paid off.

269
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:58,865
Well, she's so brainwashed,
she'll never roll on him.

270
00:14:58,865 --> 00:15:00,500
Without a drug charge to hold over...

271
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,801
What are you saying?

272
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:03,903
Everyone but King
Shithead gets busted?

273
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,472
Looks like it's time for
you to catch that bus.

274
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,209
I didn't do this so he could walk.

275
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:13,413
And I didn't do this to settle
some personal grudge of yours.

276
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:16,916
We got his house, his bottom
bitch, most of his girls.

277
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:20,186
- It was a good day.
- No.

278
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:22,155
Use me if you have to.

279
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:24,457
That cocksucker turned out
my 13-year-old sister...

280
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:26,225
...when she came to visit me.

281
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:29,128
Got her shooting up. Next
thing, she's hooking.

282
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,464
- Then she gets sick.
- AIDS?

283
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,799
I haven't seen her in two months.

284
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:36,636
Who knows who she's sucking
off for pocket change.

285
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:42,241
- Don't let him keep doing this.
- What do you think?

286
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:46,412
- Her half-assed sob story?
- No. Using her to get to Smooth.

287
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,849
Could get her killed. If she
doesn't care, why should we?

288
00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:51,951
We send her out of
town when it's done.

289
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:55,421
I say we move on to the next
thing, get her out of our lives.

290
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:59,025
The reason pimp cases are impossible
is because girls won't cooperate.

291
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:01,461
She's willing. I say we go with it.

292
00:16:02,195 --> 00:16:05,164
- Saddle someone else with it.
- I'm saddling you.

293
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:08,835
Look, you want Smooth, I
want my clubhouse back.

294
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:12,605
This isn't a barter,
it's an assignment.

295
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:16,876
Everyone's saying
Mrs. Nelson was raped.

296
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:18,378
Ma'am, we don't discuss
ongoing cases.

297
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:21,214
Look, I'm alone a lot
when my son's out...

298
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:23,883
...and I asked you if
I should be worried.

299
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:26,285
Paul Fets, have you talked with him?

300
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:29,055
- He's raped before.
- Paul Fets?

301
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:32,659
He's a registered sex offender, lives
across the street from Mrs. Nelson.

302
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,762
Why am I the one checking on this?

303
00:16:35,762 --> 00:16:38,398
Ma'am, there are 34
registered sex offenders...

304
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:40,733
...in the five-block area
around that apartment...

305
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:42,802
...including 12 high-risk felons.

306
00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:45,371
Fets followed me into
my apartment once...

307
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,707
...said he wanted to
help with my groceries.

308
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:52,378
If my son hadn't come home right
then, it would've been me.

309
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:54,414
Well, we will talk to him.

310
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:57,083
He was looking in her window...

311
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,419
...Mrs. Nelson's, about a week ago.
I caught him.

312
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:01,354
Why didn't you tell
me that this morning?

313
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,990
Because you didn't tell me you
were looking for a rapist.

314
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:09,796
Did you hear there was a woman raped
in the building next to yours?

315
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,597
No.

316
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:14,834
Somebody crawled into her window,
raped her when she came home.

317
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:18,905
Sounds a lot like that
trouble you got into before.

318
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:22,408
Sorry I'm late. Hello.

319
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,178
Mandy Trujillo.

320
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:28,281
She was a paraplegic
girl in a wheelchair.

321
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,983
You forced her side door open...

322
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:34,987
...went into her bedroom, put your
thing in her mouth, didn't you?

323
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:36,756
I don't think that way anymore.

324
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:38,391
Well, maybe you can explain...

325
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:41,661
...why somebody saw you looking
into Mrs. Nelson's window?

326
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:45,164
- The same window the rapist went in?
- That wasn't me.

327
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:49,435
Was she home? Or did you decide
to come back when she was gone?

328
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:51,871
I didn't look through her window.

329
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:55,842
And you didn't follow Wanda Ledda
into her apartment either, did you?

330
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:59,412
I was trying to help her
with the groceries.

331
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:02,949
She didn't have to tell the
neighbours about me. I...

332
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:06,586
I don't like that pressure.

333
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,457
Be here by 10 in the morning,
we'll take a run at your pimp.

334
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:13,426
Why can't we do it tonight?

335
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:16,429
Because you're not the only woman
in my life who needs attention.

336
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:21,801
- Well, where am I supposed to stay?
- Where'd you stay last night?

337
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:26,806
My place. But it's not safe there.

338
00:18:27,507 --> 00:18:29,809
Just give me some money for a motel.

339
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:33,412
I already gave you a bus ticket.
Feel free to use it any time.

340
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,217
Just call me and tell me you're okay.
Could you do that, please?

341
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,023
Great goddamn day.

342
00:18:44,023 --> 00:18:47,260
First Mara, then I gotta
share a locker with Pig-Pen.

343
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,796
- They'll be gone soon.
- Yeah, or we will.

344
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,898
They made 15 arrests last night.

345
00:18:54,534 --> 00:18:57,436
- So, what's with Mara?
- These pimps have it figured out.

346
00:18:57,436 --> 00:19:00,406
You treat them like shit,
they stick to you like flies.

347
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:02,742
If only swatting them
away was as easy.

348
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,845
I just don't wanna
swat this one away.

349
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:09,315
It's the first girl I've been
with that's better than me.

350
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:10,750
She's not better than you.

351
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:15,655
She's probably just
blowing off steam.

352
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:21,127
- Yeah.
- Just give her some space.

353
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:22,295
She'll call you.

354
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:26,933
You going out?

355
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:30,603
Yeah, I got my daughter tonight.
Mini-putt and ice cream.

356
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:32,839
- That's good, man.
- Yeah.

357
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:36,042
Be nice to get away
from all the drama.

358
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:38,744
Mom.

359
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:41,280
I'm sorry, I don't
know what happened.

360
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,383
- She kept screaming to come home.
- Go get ready for bed.

361
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:45,885
I want Daddy to tuck me in.

362
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:47,220
- Go to your room.
- No.

363
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:51,324
Listen to your mother. I'll make
it up to you next week, I promise.

364
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:52,792
No, Daddy, please stay.

365
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:55,061
- Jesus.
- Cassidy, stop this right now.

366
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:58,998
Well, hold on. Maybe I should
stay, just for an hour.

367
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:02,935
Cassidy come here right now.
Get over here. Listen to me.

368
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:06,138
I know what you're doing, and
it's not going to work, okay?

369
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:10,543
Your father's going to leave now.
If you wanna spend time with him...

370
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:14,347
...you will behave when it's his
turn to see you. Now, let's go.

371
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:16,182
No, Daddy, please don't go.

372
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:17,516
- Go.
- Please, Daddy, don't go!

373
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:19,819
- Go.
- Dad, don't. Please.

374
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:21,587
- Go!
- Dad, please don't.

375
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:27,426
As you can imagine, I deal
with rape and death every day.

376
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:31,631
- I'm sorry.
- I don't mind. Feel like I'm helping.

377
00:20:31,631 --> 00:20:34,634
Like I'm taking bad people away
before they can hurt somebody else.

378
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:37,436
That's not me.

379
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:39,305
In my experience, people who would...

380
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:42,642
...rape an old woman
or a crippled lady...

381
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:44,911
...they always do it again.

382
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:47,680
You do know that, right?

383
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:52,151
You know what a moral compass is?

384
00:20:56,355 --> 00:21:00,660
It's a thing in people that tells
them what's right and what's wrong.

385
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:04,263
They know because this
moral compass guides them.

386
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,366
Only it gets broken in
some people, smashed.

387
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:12,471
So they do these horrible things,
but it's not their fault.

388
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:16,108
Their compass is just broken.

389
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,251
Can I go to the bathroom?

390
00:21:27,053 --> 00:21:29,622
- Sure.
- No, this is for girls.

391
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,691
The men's is broken.

392
00:21:31,691 --> 00:21:33,826
It's all right, everybody
uses this one.

393
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,601
I did things.

394
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:50,009
I know.

395
00:21:51,944 --> 00:21:56,148
What...? All right, what if
your moral compass is broken?

396
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,851
How do you fix it?

397
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:01,921
You can't.

398
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:04,757
Isabel, that old woman...

399
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:10,029
...this is the last sexual
experience she's gonna have.

400
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:12,631
I mean, can you even imagine that?

401
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:15,868
A grandmother. Imagine if
it were your grandmother.

402
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:20,940
I don't think you wanna
hurt anybody again...

403
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:26,045
...but you gotta help me make
sure that doesn't happen.

404
00:22:26,045 --> 00:22:30,516
- I don't wanna be broken.
- Okay.

405
00:22:31,417 --> 00:22:32,952
Okay.

406
00:22:43,796 --> 00:22:46,766
- Javier send you?
- What are we going to do?

407
00:22:48,501 --> 00:22:51,070
I don't think there's
much we can do, Jorje.

408
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,672
Sanchez is a friend.

409
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:56,409
- Of yours.
- He's been supportive of you.

410
00:22:56,409 --> 00:22:59,312
Letting him go without processing
while I look into things...

411
00:22:59,312 --> 00:23:00,880
...is as supportive as I can be.

412
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,150
He told me it was entrapment.
Is it possible?

413
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:06,519
I plan on talking to
the arresting officer.

414
00:23:07,654 --> 00:23:11,357
I remember when a reporter was
asking questions about you once...

415
00:23:11,357 --> 00:23:13,593
...about the rape at USC.

416
00:23:13,593 --> 00:23:15,028
I didn't rape anyone.

417
00:23:15,028 --> 00:23:18,331
- She was an unstable woman.
- Yeah, but I supported you.

418
00:23:18,331 --> 00:23:21,134
And I never asked you
if it was true or not.

419
00:23:23,436 --> 00:23:25,438
Tell me about the Sanchez arrest.

420
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:28,908
He pulled up to the curb.

421
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:32,145
- Did you flag him?
- I smiled at him.

422
00:23:32,145 --> 00:23:35,181
- I do have a nice smile.
- Then what?

423
00:23:35,181 --> 00:23:38,585
I engaged him. He said the magic
words, I gave the signal.

424
00:23:38,585 --> 00:23:41,387
- Be more specific.
- He's into pegging.

425
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:47,026
He said he wanted to do me
with his favourite dildo...

426
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:50,396
...then have me strap one
on and return the favour.

427
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:52,765
Offered me 150 bucks,
the cheap bastard.

428
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:56,636
- I've had men go as high as five.
- He's claiming it was entrapment.

429
00:23:57,437 --> 00:24:00,607
Did you see his bag?
Bondage is more like it.

430
00:24:03,543 --> 00:24:06,112
I'm still looking into this case.

431
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:08,481
Don't discuss it with anyone.

432
00:24:08,481 --> 00:24:11,985
Hey, you guys took a call at L.A.
Sound Design last week?

433
00:24:11,985 --> 00:24:13,920
- The one on Sixth Street?
- Yeah.

434
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,922
Just took one at the
store on Olympic.

435
00:24:15,922 --> 00:24:18,625
I asked the owner for
his surveillance...

436
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:20,593
...he goes in the back
for two minutes,...

437
00:24:20,593 --> 00:24:22,862
...comes out, the tape is ruined.

438
00:24:22,862 --> 00:24:24,364
Ours didn't have a camera.

439
00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:26,966
Two in two weeks.

440
00:24:27,934 --> 00:24:30,803
Hey, can I get a copy of the
serial numbers you guys took?

441
00:24:32,071 --> 00:24:34,107
Isn't that for the insurance
company to worry about?

442
00:24:34,907 --> 00:24:37,110
Yeah, but the detectives
are short-staffed.

443
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:40,647
It's low priority. I was thinking
maybe we can sniff around on our own.

444
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:42,548
Just because you been
on the sidelines...

445
00:24:42,548 --> 00:24:44,817
...doesn't mean you have
to play Wonder Woman.

446
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:47,654
Though I might be able to
dig up the outfit for you.

447
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:49,622
The call didn't seem right to me.

448
00:24:49,622 --> 00:24:51,090
We filed our paperwork.

449
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:55,595
Yeah, there was nothing weird that
I can remember about the call.

450
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,364
Fine.

451
00:24:59,432 --> 00:25:00,867
Sorry to interrupt your dinner.

452
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,738
Hey, Danny.

453
00:25:05,738 --> 00:25:07,774
Give me half an hour, and I'll
pull it all together for you.

454
00:25:09,275 --> 00:25:10,443
Thanks.

455
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,413
Keep it simple. Turn around.

456
00:25:14,781 --> 00:25:18,418
Tell him you want back into his
stable, you'll do whatever it takes.

457
00:25:18,418 --> 00:25:21,287
- I asked him before.
- Most of his girls are in lockup.

458
00:25:21,287 --> 00:25:23,256
Chances are he'll need temps.

459
00:25:23,256 --> 00:25:25,892
Can't wait to see his
face when we bust him.

460
00:25:25,892 --> 00:25:28,528
Well, if he gets
rough, I'll stop him.

461
00:25:28,528 --> 00:25:30,129
I can handle a beating.

462
00:25:31,564 --> 00:25:32,932
You won't have to.

463
00:25:35,234 --> 00:25:36,436
Bury it.

464
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:43,776
- Don't touch me.
- Come on.

465
00:25:43,776 --> 00:25:46,913
Like you never took a
free suck from Connie.

466
00:25:46,913 --> 00:25:48,681
We can help each other.

467
00:25:48,681 --> 00:25:50,616
Just put on the goddamn wire.

468
00:25:50,616 --> 00:25:52,452
She said you were nice.

469
00:25:52,452 --> 00:25:54,887
All you've ever been
to me is a jerk.

470
00:25:58,524 --> 00:26:01,194
Place the wire and follow me.

471
00:26:01,194 --> 00:26:03,296
Dutch got a confession
from the rapist.

472
00:26:03,296 --> 00:26:04,664
That's great news.

473
00:26:04,664 --> 00:26:07,100
Hey, just curious.

474
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,803
We arrested 15 johns
yesterday, but only booked 14.

475
00:26:11,771 --> 00:26:14,207
- I released one.
- Now I'm even more curious.

476
00:26:14,207 --> 00:26:16,609
Javier Sanchez is the
superintendent of schools.

477
00:26:16,609 --> 00:26:18,911
I'm double-checking the
facts before proceeding.

478
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:21,380
His facts couldn't be
checked from the cage?

479
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,149
I'm extending him a courtesy.

480
00:26:23,149 --> 00:26:26,652
What qualifies as the
special-treatment club this week?

481
00:26:26,652 --> 00:26:30,289
As soon as he's processed,
he'll be publicly humiliated.

482
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:32,391
His career, effectively,
will be over.

483
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:34,794
I was under the impression
we were showing people...

484
00:26:34,794 --> 00:26:38,231
- ...that things were changing here.
- We are.

485
00:26:38,231 --> 00:26:40,466
Smells like the same cooking to me.

486
00:26:43,636 --> 00:26:47,840
You made all of these arrests
in the last hour? Good work.

487
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,510
Finish the handoff then
get back out there.

488
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:52,512
We keep hauling in this many fish...

489
00:26:52,512 --> 00:26:54,547
...we might need to
find you new digs.

490
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:58,351
- We set?
- Yeah, just waiting for your okay.

491
00:27:00,553 --> 00:27:01,687
Yeah?

492
00:27:02,655 --> 00:27:04,056
Where have you been?

493
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:07,760
Look, you understand that
once you go in there...

494
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,295
...your life's at stake.

495
00:27:09,896 --> 00:27:12,665
- Yes.
- You're gonna have to get on the bus.

496
00:27:12,665 --> 00:27:14,600
- I will.
- Look, I gotta go.

497
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,402
We're in the middle
of something here.

498
00:27:16,402 --> 00:27:18,004
I'm sorry. Look, I
need a personal day.

499
00:27:21,174 --> 00:27:22,408
Not a problem.

500
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:28,681
<i>Look who crawled out
</i>from under its rock.

501
00:27:29,649 --> 00:27:30,950
Can we talk?

502
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:34,487
- You got nothing to say, bitch.
- I'll work twice as hard.

503
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:39,025
- I'll be your best earner.
- I said you have nothing to say.

504
00:27:41,861 --> 00:27:43,396
Gotta go.

505
00:27:43,596 --> 00:27:45,064
Hold on.

506
00:27:45,698 --> 00:27:49,101
You go out, hit it hard enough
tonight, maybe we'll talk.

507
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:51,904
You freak on me again, I'll kill you.

508
00:28:07,486 --> 00:28:08,621
It's good.

509
00:28:09,622 --> 00:28:11,991
We got it on tape. Good job.

510
00:28:17,496 --> 00:28:19,465
These turn into
bruises, get Polaroids.

511
00:28:19,465 --> 00:28:20,633
Yep.

512
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:26,505
Can I get your opinion on something?

513
00:28:26,505 --> 00:28:28,808
I'd stick with the fishnets.

514
00:28:28,808 --> 00:28:30,977
French maid's outfit
might be too much.

515
00:28:31,744 --> 00:28:34,247
I got stuck between Claudette
and Aceveda on something.

516
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:37,383
What exactly are the
politics around here?

517
00:28:38,584 --> 00:28:39,886
Tell me more.

518
00:28:39,886 --> 00:28:42,421
That john I brought in
with the goodie bag.

519
00:28:42,688 --> 00:28:44,624
Seems like Aceveda
wants it to go away.

520
00:28:44,624 --> 00:28:47,660
- Important guy, I guess.
- Claudette has another idea.

521
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:50,162
So push comes to shove,
which pony would you ride?

522
00:28:52,131 --> 00:28:54,333
Aceveda's still the boss.

523
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:56,302
After that, city council.

524
00:28:57,136 --> 00:28:59,538
If he asks for something,
do him the favor.

525
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,241
Thanks.

526
00:29:03,576 --> 00:29:05,044
You like Chinese?

527
00:29:05,544 --> 00:29:06,979
Sometimes.

528
00:29:07,747 --> 00:29:10,149
I'll take you to Chinese
sometime, pay you back.

529
00:29:14,854 --> 00:29:17,189
- Fets didn't cuddle.
- What?

530
00:29:17,189 --> 00:29:18,958
In his statement, he says...

531
00:29:18,958 --> 00:29:22,728
...he raped her, then left. He can't
tell me anything about the jewellery.

532
00:29:22,728 --> 00:29:25,631
Says he dumped it but
doesn't remember where.

533
00:29:25,631 --> 00:29:27,299
We've got a confession.

534
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:29,635
We got a witness who
saw him at the window.

535
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:32,271
He is slow.

536
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:35,708
This is a guy who raped a woman,
didn't leave a single hair fiber.

537
00:29:35,708 --> 00:29:38,778
Now, not only have I been
chasing the wrong guy...

538
00:29:38,778 --> 00:29:40,546
...I caught him.

539
00:29:40,546 --> 00:29:44,383
Give Smooth the money. Be very
clear you earned it hooking.

540
00:29:44,383 --> 00:29:46,786
That's like $600. It's not enough.

541
00:29:46,786 --> 00:29:48,821
You've been at it a couple of hours.

542
00:29:48,821 --> 00:29:52,358
- He won't take this. It's an insult.
- Make it work. It's all we have.

543
00:29:52,358 --> 00:29:54,126
He'll kill me if I
give him this little.

544
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:55,828
We're not gonna let him hurt you.

545
00:29:56,996 --> 00:29:59,398
No. I'll just tell him.
I'll just go and explain.

546
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:02,501
- You won't explain anything.
- I'll tell him I changed my mind.

547
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:04,937
- You tell him that, he will kill you.
- Let go of me.

548
00:30:04,937 --> 00:30:07,974
You don't give a shit about me!
You're bastard!

549
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:11,344
- He'll take care of me if I tell him.
- Don't do it.

550
00:30:11,344 --> 00:30:13,479
I'm not doing this.

551
00:30:17,984 --> 00:30:20,619
You think you could
just walk away from me?

552
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:22,288
Get off of me.

553
00:30:22,288 --> 00:30:23,889
You made me a promise.

554
00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:27,693
- You told me you wanted this.
- I don't wanna do this anymore.

555
00:30:30,997 --> 00:30:32,398
Because you're scared?

556
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:35,301
- He'll kill me.
- You need to be scared of me.

557
00:30:37,837 --> 00:30:39,772
- Vic...
- Back off!

558
00:30:39,772 --> 00:30:41,841
Let me just go talk to him.

559
00:30:41,841 --> 00:30:45,344
Take it! Now!

560
00:30:49,115 --> 00:30:50,783
Smooth's my bitch...

561
00:30:50,783 --> 00:30:53,919
...which makes you my bottom bitch.

562
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:57,423
You're gonna go out there, and
you're gonna do what I told you.

563
00:30:57,423 --> 00:30:59,358
Or I swear to God, I will hurt you...

564
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:01,560
...like you've never been
goddamn hurt before.

565
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,262
You understand?

566
00:31:05,464 --> 00:31:07,733
- Say it!
- Okay.

567
00:31:14,306 --> 00:31:15,541
Good.

568
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:22,148
You wanna make me happy?

569
00:31:23,916 --> 00:31:26,452
- Yes.
- I'm sure you do.

570
00:31:32,658 --> 00:31:33,793
Okay.

571
00:31:36,095 --> 00:31:37,396
Now...

572
00:31:38,364 --> 00:31:39,932
...do what I told you.

573
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:44,270
Good girl. Go ahead.

574
00:31:59,018 --> 00:32:02,889
- What the hell was that?
- I just saved her life. You watch.

575
00:32:03,222 --> 00:32:06,225
<i>- Rolled some tricks for you, baby.
</i>- Slow your roll, ho.

576
00:32:06,225 --> 00:32:08,461
<i>Po-po's been cracking down.
</i>Come here.

577
00:32:11,531 --> 00:32:13,766
<i>All right. Give up the skrilla.</i>

578
00:32:13,766 --> 00:32:16,736
- I can't see her.
- We're fine.

579
00:32:16,736 --> 00:32:18,504
<i>Petty cash. Where's the cheddar?</i>

580
00:32:18,504 --> 00:32:21,140
- Sucked a lot of dxxxs for that.
- You coming crooked on me?

581
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,109
It's all I got. You don't like it?

582
00:32:23,109 --> 00:32:25,144
<i>- Shove it up your ass.
</i>- What's she doing?

583
00:32:25,144 --> 00:32:26,646
Damn it, she's baiting him. Let's go.

584
00:32:26,646 --> 00:32:28,481
<i>Is that how it's gonna be?</i>

585
00:32:29,983 --> 00:32:32,151
- Punk ass, you're nothing.
- Yeah?

586
00:32:32,151 --> 00:32:36,489
You don't scare me. Help! Let
go of me. I said let go of me.

587
00:32:42,528 --> 00:32:43,930
Bastard!

588
00:32:44,631 --> 00:32:46,032
Get back!

589
00:32:46,299 --> 00:32:48,301
Stay still. Don't fight me.

590
00:32:52,372 --> 00:32:55,408
I got marks. You can say he hit
me, get him put away longer.

591
00:32:55,408 --> 00:32:58,711
I'm not lying. We got him for
what we got him on and that's it.

592
00:32:58,711 --> 00:33:02,415
It'll be a long time before another
pimp thinks about laying a hand on me.

593
00:33:02,415 --> 00:33:04,851
You forgetting about
that bus to San Jose?

594
00:33:04,851 --> 00:33:06,653
I don't need it anymore.

595
00:33:06,653 --> 00:33:08,354
You're protecting me.

596
00:33:08,354 --> 00:33:10,456
No, I'm not. We're done now.

597
00:33:10,456 --> 00:33:13,292
- Finished.
- Why are you such a shithead?

598
00:33:13,292 --> 00:33:15,161
I chose you over Smooth.

599
00:33:15,161 --> 00:33:17,263
I stopped you from killing yourself.

600
00:33:17,263 --> 00:33:18,765
You stuck a gun in my mouth.

601
00:33:18,765 --> 00:33:20,466
No, I did not.

602
00:33:20,466 --> 00:33:23,069
- Now you're not gonna protect me?
- Shut up right now.

603
00:33:23,069 --> 00:33:25,138
You're a bigger bastard than Smooth!

604
00:33:25,538 --> 00:33:28,508
Bigger than the one who turned
out your 13-year-old sister?

605
00:33:28,508 --> 00:33:30,309
- Right.
- I found out the only sister...

606
00:33:30,309 --> 00:33:32,545
...you have is 7 and
living in San Jose.

607
00:33:32,545 --> 00:33:35,615
You're just pissed off that
Smooth stopped you from earning.

608
00:33:35,615 --> 00:33:38,618
Is that what you did to Connie too?
Used her?

609
00:33:38,618 --> 00:33:40,353
She trusted you, and
you got her killed.

610
00:33:40,353 --> 00:33:42,755
- Time to go.
- You dared that guy.

611
00:33:42,755 --> 00:33:45,058
Her boy doesn't have a mother.
That's your fault.

612
00:33:45,058 --> 00:33:48,861
- Wouldn't want you to miss your bus.
- You didn't give a shit about Connie!

613
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:52,198
I tolerated her to the extent
she could help me make cases.

614
00:33:52,198 --> 00:33:55,034
She's dead because of you.

615
00:33:55,034 --> 00:33:56,335
No.

616
00:33:56,335 --> 00:33:58,771
You all find ways of
killing yourselves.

617
00:34:00,807 --> 00:34:02,408
Go find yours.

618
00:34:04,077 --> 00:34:05,578
Bastard!

619
00:34:05,578 --> 00:34:09,315
- You call for backup?
- We got a hit on the stolen stereo.

620
00:34:09,315 --> 00:34:13,352
A Sun Yun Do at this residence
registered online to get the warranty.

621
00:34:13,352 --> 00:34:15,221
Sure you didn't wanna call SWAT?

622
00:34:15,221 --> 00:34:16,756
You guys were so helpful
breaking this...

623
00:34:16,756 --> 00:34:19,158
...I thought you'd wanna
be here for the arrest.

624
00:34:22,195 --> 00:34:24,697
- What the hell are these?
- I went to see Isabel.

625
00:34:24,697 --> 00:34:26,632
One of them's Fets.

626
00:34:26,632 --> 00:34:30,703
You showed a 73-year-old
rape victim a xxxxx line-up?

627
00:34:30,703 --> 00:34:33,072
She wants the guy caught.
All she saw was the xxxxx.

628
00:34:33,072 --> 00:34:35,308
Plus, she picked the wrong one.

629
00:34:36,642 --> 00:34:38,478
So whose did she choose?

630
00:34:41,748 --> 00:34:43,449
Couldn't get anyone
else to volunteer.

631
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:44,784
Dutch.

632
00:34:44,784 --> 00:34:47,220
Well, I didn't ask
you to look at them.

633
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:49,622
It's not anything you
haven't seen before.

634
00:34:49,622 --> 00:34:53,860
The important thing is, Isabel
confirms that Fets isn't our guy.

635
00:34:56,729 --> 00:34:58,598
We're sending you home.

636
00:34:58,598 --> 00:35:00,099
Why?

637
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:02,168
Because you didn't rape Mrs. Nelson.

638
00:35:02,168 --> 00:35:05,538
But I think about it. With other
women. Just like you said.

639
00:35:05,538 --> 00:35:07,039
Still, you didn't do it.

640
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:09,142
No, my moral compass is broken.

641
00:35:12,779 --> 00:35:16,949
Look, that was just an
interrogation technique.

642
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:19,819
I needed you to believe it
because I wanted you to confess.

643
00:35:21,287 --> 00:35:25,658
Mandy Trujillo was seven years ago.
You've been good since then, right?

644
00:35:25,658 --> 00:35:26,959
I tried real hard.

645
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:30,029
Well, and it's working. There's a Dr.
Lakeman...

646
00:35:30,029 --> 00:35:32,965
...who's gonna come talk
to you about staying good.

647
00:35:32,965 --> 00:35:35,368
I can't go home.

648
00:35:35,368 --> 00:35:38,504
She told everybody about me.
And about Mandy.

649
00:35:39,872 --> 00:35:43,276
Everybody hates me. She's gonna tell
them that I did it to that old woman.

650
00:35:43,276 --> 00:35:44,911
I'll talk to your neighbors.

651
00:35:44,911 --> 00:35:47,513
We're gonna catch the guy
who really did this.

652
00:35:47,513 --> 00:35:49,048
Here's my card.

653
00:35:49,048 --> 00:35:51,751
You call me if you need anything.
Anything.

654
00:36:02,128 --> 00:36:03,796
You said you weren't gonna be here.

655
00:36:04,964 --> 00:36:06,933
I wanted to see you for myself.

656
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:10,403
I'm just gonna get the rest of
my things then I'm leaving.

657
00:36:10,403 --> 00:36:12,238
What is your problem?

658
00:36:16,142 --> 00:36:18,778
Why are you acting like
such a psycho bitch?

659
00:36:18,778 --> 00:36:20,580
Just leave me alone.

660
00:36:23,149 --> 00:36:25,518
All right, fine. Fine.
You wanna leave?

661
00:36:25,518 --> 00:36:27,553
Then pack your shit. Get out!

662
00:36:28,154 --> 00:36:29,822
Here, better yet, let me help you.

663
00:36:32,491 --> 00:36:35,094
Why are you sulking? You're
the one who turned on me.

664
00:36:35,094 --> 00:36:36,696
That's not true.

665
00:36:36,696 --> 00:36:39,298
So, what was the plan? You
couldn't afford a car?

666
00:36:39,298 --> 00:36:43,202
So you give up a little ass, play
house till you can make your getaway?

667
00:36:43,202 --> 00:36:46,439
- You're such a jerk.
- How's the Lexus driving?

668
00:36:46,439 --> 00:36:49,542
Keep your goddamn car!

669
00:36:49,542 --> 00:36:51,244
You keep it. You earned it.

670
00:36:51,244 --> 00:36:53,112
Hope the next guy enjoys it.

671
00:36:53,112 --> 00:36:57,884
Please, you gonna start crying now?
Let's see the floodgates open, Mara.

672
00:36:58,684 --> 00:37:01,420
- Just let me go.
- No, I wanna see you cry first.

673
00:37:01,754 --> 00:37:05,458
- Let me leave.
- No, I wanna see how you leaving me.

674
00:37:06,192 --> 00:37:07,493
Tearing me...

675
00:37:08,761 --> 00:37:10,730
I wanna see how it makes you cry.

676
00:37:15,234 --> 00:37:16,602
I'm pregnant.

677
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:18,638
Bullshit.

678
00:37:19,538 --> 00:37:20,873
I am.

679
00:37:23,242 --> 00:37:24,677
It was an accident.

680
00:37:28,114 --> 00:37:31,017
Sorry, okay? I'm sorry!

681
00:37:32,518 --> 00:37:34,954
- Well, we'll get married.
- No!

682
00:37:34,954 --> 00:37:36,355
God, help me.

683
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:46,198
Hey.

684
00:37:52,038 --> 00:37:55,308
Hey. Look at me.

685
00:37:57,977 --> 00:37:59,879
Hey.

686
00:38:03,816 --> 00:38:05,351
Marry me.

687
00:38:13,393 --> 00:38:15,762
I had some more ideas on
your transition team.

688
00:38:15,762 --> 00:38:17,063
So did Aurora.

689
00:38:17,063 --> 00:38:19,666
Maybe we could get
together this week.

690
00:38:19,666 --> 00:38:21,134
Thought you should know...

691
00:38:21,134 --> 00:38:24,237
...Carlos Izturis from the
Daily News is downstairs.

692
00:38:24,237 --> 00:38:26,539
- Hello.
- What does he want?

693
00:38:26,539 --> 00:38:29,175
He is coming to ask about...

694
00:38:29,175 --> 00:38:33,613
...Javier Sanchez being
arrested for solicitation.

695
00:38:35,615 --> 00:38:38,651
- I know Carlos, I can talk to him.
- Good.

696
00:38:38,651 --> 00:38:41,020
Tell him I'm moving
forward with the arrest.

697
00:38:41,754 --> 00:38:44,123
- Give us a minute.
- Take a month...

698
00:38:44,123 --> 00:38:45,859
...nothing's gonna change.

699
00:38:49,529 --> 00:38:51,331
Send some unis to pick him up.

700
00:38:52,866 --> 00:38:54,567
Nice seeing you again.

701
00:38:59,105 --> 00:39:02,709
She leaked this. She
brought Izturis in.

702
00:39:02,709 --> 00:39:07,046
The important thing is we cut
bait before Javier drags us down.

703
00:39:08,314 --> 00:39:09,749
Dutch.

704
00:39:09,749 --> 00:39:12,151
Hey. Congrats on your job back.

705
00:39:12,151 --> 00:39:16,322
Thanks. Hey, thanks for
talking to Aceveda for me.

706
00:39:16,322 --> 00:39:18,691
This is that case I
left the message about.

707
00:39:18,691 --> 00:39:20,293
Yeah. Insurance thing, right?

708
00:39:20,293 --> 00:39:24,063
Yeah. Guy's robbing from himself
then making the claims.

709
00:39:24,063 --> 00:39:27,333
Sure makes it easier when officers
just hand me closed cases.

710
00:39:27,333 --> 00:39:28,668
Just trying to help.

711
00:39:28,668 --> 00:39:30,637
Detective, call for you on three.

712
00:39:33,406 --> 00:39:34,674
Detective Wagenbach.

713
00:39:34,674 --> 00:39:37,010
<i>- I tried real hard.
</i>- Hello?

714
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:39,646
<i>Her son just left. She's alone.</i>

715
00:39:39,646 --> 00:39:42,181
- Paul?
<i>- Finally got that bitch alone.</i>

716
00:39:42,181 --> 00:39:44,918
- Paul?
<i>- Now you can stop me.</i>

717
00:39:44,918 --> 00:39:46,920
Paul, don't go anywhere, all right?

718
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,621
Let me talk to you.

719
00:39:48,621 --> 00:39:52,125
<i>- You have to stop me.
</i>- Rape in progress. Call it in.

720
00:39:52,659 --> 00:39:54,460
Paul, what are you feeling right now?

721
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:56,863
<i>How do you change what you want?</i>

722
00:39:57,163 --> 00:39:59,098
It isn't what you want.

723
00:39:59,098 --> 00:40:00,733
I promise you.

724
00:40:00,733 --> 00:40:02,902
You've done so well.

725
00:40:02,902 --> 00:40:06,139
<i>No, I haven't. I'll try
</i>not to hurt her too bad.

726
00:40:06,539 --> 00:40:08,207
Paul? Paul...

727
00:40:09,242 --> 00:40:10,677
Police! Open up!

728
00:40:19,452 --> 00:40:22,922
- Police!
- Stop!

729
00:40:22,922 --> 00:40:24,357
Stop!

730
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,195
Let me see your hands.

731
00:40:39,939 --> 00:40:41,808
School and sex crimes.

732
00:40:41,808 --> 00:40:43,576
That story's gonna hit big.

733
00:40:43,576 --> 00:40:45,111
He brought it on himself.

734
00:40:45,111 --> 00:40:48,314
You helped a little. I
know I didn't call Carlos.

735
00:40:48,314 --> 00:40:49,782
Why would I call?

736
00:40:49,782 --> 00:40:51,851
We're sending a message.

737
00:40:51,851 --> 00:40:54,120
We're showing people
we're cracking down...

738
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,222
...and no one's safe in Farmington.

739
00:40:57,323 --> 00:41:02,161
And you did it in a way that
didn't squash you and Machado.

740
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:05,999
You always were my best detective.

741
00:41:12,105 --> 00:41:13,573
You looking for a date?

742
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,642
I want her.

743
00:41:18,244 --> 00:41:21,147
She's not for sale.
That's Nasty's new girl.

744
00:41:21,147 --> 00:41:23,216
How much to talk for two minutes?

745
00:41:46,139 --> 00:41:47,640
Just wanna talk?

746
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:50,143
I see you missed that bus.

747
00:41:50,143 --> 00:41:52,345
Figured I'd stay.

748
00:41:52,345 --> 00:41:54,113
I know Nasty.

749
00:41:54,113 --> 00:41:57,850
He's good at what he does. You
angling for him this whole time?

750
00:41:57,850 --> 00:42:01,587
No. After you kicked
me, I had to survive.

751
00:42:01,587 --> 00:42:04,090
Told Nasty I'd help him
get Smooth's girls.

752
00:42:05,558 --> 00:42:07,560
So it's all my fault?

753
00:42:08,061 --> 00:42:10,163
Thanks for helping make me queen.

754
00:42:11,998 --> 00:42:13,766
Enjoy your kingdom.

755
00:42:16,102 --> 00:42:17,570
That's 20 bucks.

756
00:42:42,528 --> 00:42:46,399
I mean, I'm through the door, and all
I see is a black blur flying by me.

757
00:42:47,633 --> 00:42:49,569
You're getting slow.

758
00:42:49,569 --> 00:42:53,840
All I know is the rapist bastard got a
double dip of vanilla and chocolate.

759
00:42:57,376 --> 00:42:59,178
Hey, Julien, you walking out?

760
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:01,848
Not yet.

761
00:43:02,882 --> 00:43:05,351
All right. I'll see you tomorrow.

762
00:43:05,351 --> 00:43:09,622
He knocked the wind out of him. We got
back here, he's still out of breath.

763
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:12,859
Wagenbach's upstairs.

764
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,728
- Congrats, man.
- Thank you, man.

765
00:43:15,728 --> 00:43:19,065
- Thank you, buddy.
- Thank you, buddy.

766
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:26,706
- Hey, man, where's Vic?
- Don't know, man.

767
00:43:28,541 --> 00:43:31,477
- I'm gonna step outside for a second.
- All right. Okay.

768
00:43:35,648 --> 00:43:38,117
Hey, Wayne. Beer's inside, buddy.

769
00:43:38,117 --> 00:43:40,987
- Hey.
- Thank you.

770
00:43:40,987 --> 00:43:42,555
You know where Vic is, man?

771
00:43:42,555 --> 00:43:43,923
No clue.

772
00:43:54,967 --> 00:43:57,170
Is this the foster home
for Brian Reisler?

773
00:43:57,170 --> 00:44:01,307
- Yeah. Is there a problem?
- Can I see him?

774
00:44:01,974 --> 00:44:03,209
Sure.

775
00:44:08,681 --> 00:44:10,149
What's going on?

776
00:44:10,917 --> 00:44:12,418
He wants to see Brian.

777
00:44:38,611 --> 00:44:41,113
- How is he?
- What do you mean?

778
00:44:41,113 --> 00:44:44,083
Is he talking yet? Making friends?
What's he like to do?

779
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:46,185
He plays with the other children.

780
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:49,555
How many foster children
do you have here?

781
00:44:49,555 --> 00:44:50,857
Five.

782
00:44:54,093 --> 00:44:58,497
Five hundred a head, that's
2500 you're pulling in a month.

783
00:44:59,932 --> 00:45:01,367
Where's it all going?

784
00:45:02,401 --> 00:45:03,936
You're saying we're skimping?

785
00:45:05,104 --> 00:45:07,840
- They get what they need.
- Three hots and a cot?

786
00:45:08,608 --> 00:45:11,844
- You bank the rest?
- What do you know about raising kids?

787
00:45:11,844 --> 00:45:14,280
They're better off here
than they were out there.

788
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,781
How do you know that?

789
00:45:15,781 --> 00:45:17,750
His mother was a crack whore.

790
00:45:19,151 --> 00:45:20,620
I knew her.

791
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:22,655
Then you know what I'm talking about.

792
00:45:22,655 --> 00:45:24,390
At least we're there for them.

793
00:45:34,634 --> 00:45:37,403
I'm gonna be checking in
on him from time to time.

794
00:45:37,403 --> 00:45:39,505
I better like what I see.
