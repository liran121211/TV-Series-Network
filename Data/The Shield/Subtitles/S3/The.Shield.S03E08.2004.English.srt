1
00:00:00,801 --> 00:00:02,387
<i>Previously on "The Shield".</i>

2
00:00:02,388 --> 00:00:04,166
We keep hauling in
this many fish,

3
00:00:04,167 --> 00:00:06,538
we might need to
find you new digs.

4
00:00:06,539 --> 00:00:08,309
You're assigned to Trish
for the day.

5
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:09,858
I'll try to
break you in easy.

6
00:00:09,859 --> 00:00:12,308
I have no problem
working with the Decoy Squad,

7
00:00:12,309 --> 00:00:13,650
but we don't work
for them.

8
00:00:13,651 --> 00:00:16,419
That's right.
You work for me.

9
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:19,514
I want my own child too.
With you.

10
00:00:19,515 --> 00:00:21,128
A man like
Shane Vendrell

11
00:00:21,129 --> 00:00:23,355
could get his woman pregnant
without even trying.

12
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:25,699
I will go to the doctor
and I will see what I can do.

13
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,829
We think this cuddler rapist
has been around for a while.

14
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,171
The victims could just pile up
until he makes a mistake.

15
00:00:31,172 --> 00:00:32,655
So far,
he hasn't made one.

16
00:00:32,656 --> 00:00:34,155
If you live
in the area,

17
00:00:34,156 --> 00:00:35,954
keep your blinds drawn
at all times.

18
00:00:35,955 --> 00:00:37,960
Because he scopes out
his victims during the day.

19
00:00:37,961 --> 00:00:39,996
Your ex-wife and son
were found murdered.

20
00:00:39,997 --> 00:00:41,224
I'm very sorry.

21
00:00:41,225 --> 00:00:43,053
You hired someone
to knock over your house?

22
00:00:43,054 --> 00:00:44,638
I have a coin collection
from my dad.

23
00:00:44,639 --> 00:00:45,902
She got half
in the settlement.

24
00:00:45,903 --> 00:00:47,500
So you hired someone
to steal them back.

25
00:00:47,501 --> 00:00:48,537
It was
a one-time thing.

26
00:00:48,538 --> 00:00:51,383
This guy came back for seconds,
killed them both.

27
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,049
Arnovic has given full
confession.

28
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:54,444
What's that gonna mean
for Tommy?

29
00:00:54,445 --> 00:00:56,181
Probably his job.

30
00:00:56,182 --> 00:00:57,577
We can't spend a nickel

31
00:00:57,578 --> 00:00:59,390
until we know
which bills are marked.

32
00:00:59,391 --> 00:01:01,091
Treasury's got Aceveda
checking bills

33
00:01:01,092 --> 00:01:02,478
on any bust over a grand.

34
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,133
- List in Aceveda's safe.
- Just get the list.

35
00:01:05,418 --> 00:01:06,822
- Got it.
- Go.

36
00:01:06,823 --> 00:01:08,851
If we're looking for a body
it must be Lauren.

37
00:01:08,852 --> 00:01:11,113
- You still got that boyfriend?
- Still got that wife?

38
00:01:11,114 --> 00:01:13,071
No.
Still got that boyfriend?

39
00:01:13,152 --> 00:01:15,901
- I can't do tonight.
- It's probably a sign.

40
00:01:15,902 --> 00:01:19,430
- It's scheduling snafu.
- No, it feels like a sign.

41
00:01:22,401 --> 00:01:25,438
Move. Go, boy!
Move!

42
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:27,707
- Here we go.
- Get him.

43
00:01:29,408 --> 00:01:31,010
Get out of town.

44
00:01:32,912 --> 00:01:35,548
- Blast right now.
- That's me.

45
00:01:37,483 --> 00:01:39,118
Love you.

46
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:42,221
There you are. Get out.

47
00:01:42,221 --> 00:01:44,957
- Damn it.
- Respect me, pal.

48
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,795
I love you too, baby.

49
00:01:49,795 --> 00:01:51,697
All right, we're going again.

50
00:01:51,697 --> 00:01:53,999
- Everything cool with Mara?
- Yeah, why?

51
00:01:53,999 --> 00:01:56,702
I don't know. Seemed like she
was in a mood or something.

52
00:01:59,205 --> 00:02:00,606
Shit.

53
00:02:01,374 --> 00:02:02,708
Everything's fine.

54
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:06,145
Just that this first trimester's
like a 90-day PMS ride.

55
00:02:06,145 --> 00:02:09,181
Yeah, or maybe she thinks you're
not taking it so seriously?

56
00:02:09,181 --> 00:02:11,450
- We're getting married, aren't we?
- Set a date?

57
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,519
- No, not yet.
- What about a ring?

58
00:02:13,519 --> 00:02:16,889
I bought her a Lexus. She can
wear that on her finger.

59
00:02:16,889 --> 00:02:18,858
- She knows I love her.
- Yeah, dude.

60
00:02:18,858 --> 00:02:22,161
But a ring lets her show the rest
of the world that you love her.

61
00:02:22,161 --> 00:02:25,398
You getting your thing
waxed next week?

62
00:02:25,398 --> 00:02:27,366
Man, come on. You gotta stop that.

63
00:02:27,366 --> 00:02:29,669
Well, you gotta pony up for the rock.

64
00:02:31,337 --> 00:02:33,472
- Yeah.
<i>- Hey, it's me.</i>

65
00:02:34,006 --> 00:02:36,142
I need you down at the
storage unit ASAP.

66
00:02:36,142 --> 00:02:37,743
- Where's Lem?
<i>- He's with me.</i>

67
00:02:37,743 --> 00:02:40,813
- Is there a problem?
- Not on the phone.

68
00:02:40,813 --> 00:02:42,915
Got here as quick as I could.

69
00:02:42,915 --> 00:02:46,085
Figured we'd catch another case.
Who knew it'd be this soon?

70
00:02:46,085 --> 00:02:49,789
- Maybe it's a sign.
- What's the situation here?

71
00:02:49,789 --> 00:02:54,026
Actually, it's pretty quiet. Seems
to be a total lack of a situation.

72
00:02:54,026 --> 00:02:56,896
The message said there was a
drug dealer working here.

73
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:02,401
Well, I may have over-exaggerated
the police nature of this call.

74
00:03:05,972 --> 00:03:11,243
And I suppose you've got a key
to one of those rooms in there.

75
00:03:13,546 --> 00:03:16,749
We've been dancing around each
other for a couple of years.

76
00:03:16,749 --> 00:03:20,152
I'm just wondering what would
happen if we ran out of excuses.

77
00:03:24,557 --> 00:03:27,059
- I'm on duty.
- I'm not.

78
00:03:27,059 --> 00:03:30,262
- You got a pager if they need you.
- I've got a boyfriend.

79
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:34,333
- We already established that.
- It's really not a good idea.

80
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,369
You're right. You should get back.

81
00:03:40,873 --> 00:03:42,842
What am I supposed to do with Koto?

82
00:03:54,987 --> 00:03:57,323
Do you need to get that?

83
00:03:57,323 --> 00:03:59,358
That's what voice mail's for.

84
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,301
That's the hello line.

85
00:04:12,338 --> 00:04:13,873
Quiet!

86
00:04:19,111 --> 00:04:20,546
Hello?

87
00:04:20,546 --> 00:04:22,281
Hi, Mama. It's Toya.

88
00:04:22,281 --> 00:04:23,749
Trish, you all right?

89
00:04:24,483 --> 00:04:26,719
Nothing. Just chilling.

90
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,291
- I ain't gonna make it by for dinner.
- Can you say where you are?

91
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,527
I'm gonna kick it with
some friends tonight.

92
00:04:37,229 --> 00:04:39,265
Holler at Walon for me, all right?

93
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,635
I love you too, Mama.

94
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:49,708
Trish is in trouble. Walon too.

95
00:04:50,876 --> 00:04:53,546
- No more calls.
- Why? What's up, boo?

96
00:04:53,546 --> 00:04:55,948
That white dude you hooked
us up with is a cop.

97
00:04:55,948 --> 00:04:58,417
- No. No way.
- Undercover.

98
00:04:58,417 --> 00:05:00,886
- Quit clowning.
- I just got confirmation.

99
00:05:01,954 --> 00:05:03,722
Where you heard that?

100
00:05:03,722 --> 00:05:05,257
What do you know about him?

101
00:05:06,092 --> 00:05:11,063
Tips good. Drinks Scotch.
Shitty marriage. You know.

102
00:05:11,063 --> 00:05:13,432
I thought we were coming
here to have some fun.

103
00:05:14,467 --> 00:05:16,135
We could be in some shit.

104
00:05:16,535 --> 00:05:19,472
- You included.
- Fifties can't do nothing.

105
00:05:19,472 --> 00:05:22,475
- You ain't even done the whack yet.
- No, but I agreed to.

106
00:05:23,542 --> 00:05:28,314
You'll stick with me till I can
get this shit taken care of.

107
00:05:30,483 --> 00:05:32,251
All right.

108
00:05:32,251 --> 00:05:33,986
Just let me check my face.

109
00:05:42,228 --> 00:05:44,396
- Who is it?
- It's me. Open up.

110
00:05:51,504 --> 00:05:53,005
What's going on?

111
00:05:53,506 --> 00:05:55,141
There's money missing.

112
00:05:57,209 --> 00:06:00,112
- How much?
- We're 7 G's short.

113
00:06:00,112 --> 00:06:03,048
I was going through the stash,
getting rid of the marked bills.

114
00:06:03,048 --> 00:06:05,718
Couldn't find a few.
So I did a count.

115
00:06:05,718 --> 00:06:09,655
- We're missing 7000.
- Including some marked money.

116
00:06:09,655 --> 00:06:12,458
- You sure you counted right?
- I triple-checked.

117
00:06:15,361 --> 00:06:16,428
Somebody dip in...

118
00:06:16,428 --> 00:06:18,998
- ...before shit hit the fan?
- I didn't take squat.

119
00:06:19,832 --> 00:06:21,167
Don't even look at me.

120
00:06:21,167 --> 00:06:23,569
If somebody did, speak
up now, it's forgiven.

121
00:06:23,569 --> 00:06:26,005
Important thing is to figure out
where the money was spent...

122
00:06:26,005 --> 00:06:27,907
...before Treasury gets a whiff.

123
00:06:30,609 --> 00:06:32,044
I'm serious.

124
00:06:33,179 --> 00:06:36,315
We're the only people who knew it was
here and the only people with a key.

125
00:06:38,651 --> 00:06:40,152
Last chance.

126
00:06:43,622 --> 00:06:45,090
Come on.

127
00:06:46,659 --> 00:06:48,627
We've been a team
through all of this.

128
00:06:49,929 --> 00:06:51,630
Now, who took it?

129
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:14,854
Trish was able to make the call, so
let's assume her cover's still intact.

130
00:07:14,854 --> 00:07:17,490
- But Walon was made for sure.
- What's the emergency?

131
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:19,792
- Walon and Trish.
- Any idea where Trish was make a call?

132
00:07:19,792 --> 00:07:23,730
No, we're tracing it. I'm gonna
need four units ready to roll.

133
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:27,433
Decoy Squad's been working undercover
on a murder-for-hire sting.

134
00:07:27,433 --> 00:07:29,836
Farmtown Twelves been
doing contract hits...

135
00:07:29,836 --> 00:07:31,537
...making them look like drive-bys.

136
00:07:31,537 --> 00:07:34,040
Since when is the Decoy
Squad a gang detail?

137
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,209
Trish was our best way into the case.

138
00:07:36,209 --> 00:07:38,578
Walon's supposed to drop
the money for the hit this afternoon

139
00:07:38,578 --> 00:07:39,403
where we don't know.

140
00:07:39,404 --> 00:07:41,214
But we've got to get him
before the Twelves do.

141
00:07:41,214 --> 00:07:43,850
- You try his cell?
- He was worried he'd be searched.

142
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:46,019
Which raises the question
how this happened.

143
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:49,122
More important question is, how
are we getting our people back?

144
00:07:50,657 --> 00:07:53,660
Claudette's got us on goddamn
janitor duty the last month...

145
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:57,864
...meanwhile Walon's out
hunting down banger trophies.

146
00:07:57,864 --> 00:07:59,866
I didn't take that money.

147
00:08:02,101 --> 00:08:04,103
Okay.

148
00:08:04,103 --> 00:08:06,372
Think there's any chance
Tavon swung with it?

149
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,776
It's not enough you put
him on life support...

150
00:08:09,776 --> 00:08:11,411
...now you gotta call him a thief?

151
00:08:12,578 --> 00:08:16,749
Look, if he knew about the money,
he would've come to us for a piece.

152
00:08:16,749 --> 00:08:18,718
Just so you know...

153
00:08:19,552 --> 00:08:21,854
...I'm getting Mara
an engagement ring.

154
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,725
All right.

155
00:08:25,725 --> 00:08:28,528
- Don't go hog-wild.
- I'm not. I'm going through Taylor.

156
00:08:28,528 --> 00:08:31,497
You're using a fence to
buy your wife a ring?

157
00:08:31,497 --> 00:08:33,733
He knows this guy who
sells them wholesale.

158
00:08:33,733 --> 00:08:36,669
- It's on the level.
- Why not go to the jewellery mart?

159
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:40,473
Because Taylor's guy's cheaper
and I don't speak Farsi.

160
00:08:46,112 --> 00:08:47,346
May I help you?

161
00:08:47,346 --> 00:08:50,249
I just gotta get my
corn rows tightened.

162
00:08:55,388 --> 00:08:57,223
What up, homegirl?

163
00:08:57,223 --> 00:09:00,393
- Man, I'm straight with you.
- I need another favor.

164
00:09:00,393 --> 00:09:03,963
Yeah, well, you're fresh
out of favors, One Time.

165
00:09:03,963 --> 00:09:06,399
You're not hearing me
too well under there.

166
00:09:11,137 --> 00:09:13,573
I can see why Pretty Boy
drops the cheese...

167
00:09:13,573 --> 00:09:15,308
...to keep his female looking tight.

168
00:09:15,308 --> 00:09:17,043
Think he'll keep her when he hears...

169
00:09:17,043 --> 00:09:19,779
...she's been going out
with a Spooktown soldier?

170
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:21,647
Still sleeping with
the enemy, Desiree?

171
00:09:21,647 --> 00:09:23,683
- No.
- Trick question.

172
00:09:23,683 --> 00:09:25,384
We know you are.

173
00:09:25,384 --> 00:09:27,153
I'm just trying to get my hair did.

174
00:09:27,153 --> 00:09:29,956
I need to know who in the
Twelves is selling contract hits.

175
00:09:29,956 --> 00:09:32,625
Pretty Boy don't talk
business with me.

176
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,694
Coo in his ear.

177
00:09:34,694 --> 00:09:37,697
You got half an hour or
I start cooing in his.

178
00:09:49,876 --> 00:09:52,445
- Hands where I can see them. Now.
- Hands up.

179
00:09:53,179 --> 00:09:54,814
Let me see your hands.

180
00:09:58,785 --> 00:10:00,419
Clear in the back.

181
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,562
- Storeroom clear.
- All clear.

182
00:10:09,562 --> 00:10:12,031
- Canvass it.
- What's going on?

183
00:10:12,031 --> 00:10:15,334
The Farmtown Twelve made a call
from this phone an hour ago.

184
00:10:15,334 --> 00:10:17,336
- Where'd they go?
- Don't know.

185
00:10:17,336 --> 00:10:18,571
What were they doing here?

186
00:10:18,571 --> 00:10:21,240
- I let them use my office sometimes.
- Why?

187
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,242
Beats having them burn it down.

188
00:10:37,423 --> 00:10:40,259
Desiree. Thirty seconds to spare.

189
00:10:40,259 --> 00:10:42,028
I was just about to call Pretty Boy.

190
00:10:42,028 --> 00:10:44,597
Let him know his number one
cooch was on the loose.

191
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,401
Kaliel Wilks. Street
name, Li'l Psych.

192
00:10:48,401 --> 00:10:50,703
Any idea where we can find him?

193
00:10:50,703 --> 00:10:52,805
Yeah, well, you work on Pretty Boy.

194
00:10:52,805 --> 00:10:55,241
- He gives you anything, you call me.
- Right, I'm running it.

195
00:10:55,241 --> 00:10:57,510
Got the address where
Walon's making the meet.

196
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:01,447
I got the name of their guy who
runs contract hits. Kaliel Wilks.

197
00:11:01,447 --> 00:11:03,449
Got a reputation as
a bit of a psycho.

198
00:11:03,449 --> 00:11:04,917
Ever hear of him?

199
00:11:04,917 --> 00:11:07,486
No, but Shane's on it.

200
00:11:07,486 --> 00:11:09,789
You have any idea how
their cover got blown?

201
00:11:09,789 --> 00:11:11,591
Maybe they tailed Walon.

202
00:11:11,591 --> 00:11:14,694
Walon might stink,
but he's not sloppy.

203
00:11:14,694 --> 00:11:16,929
Rapist works in the area.

204
00:11:16,929 --> 00:11:21,500
Delivering pizza, cable-TV guy,
meter reader, who knows.

205
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,637
So, he uses his job as camouflage
and scopes out his next victim?

206
00:11:24,637 --> 00:11:27,406
Exactly. Thanks for coming
out on your own time.

207
00:11:27,406 --> 00:11:29,208
I'm learning tons.

208
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:33,479
Still, gotta be raising
hell with your social life.

209
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:37,083
Please, I kicked my social
life to the curb last week.

210
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,318
This guy was seeing bought me
this tennis racket...

211
00:11:39,318 --> 00:11:44,090
...so we could hit together, then he
insisted I leave it at his place.

212
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:46,425
Talk about control issues.

213
00:11:46,425 --> 00:11:50,096
- Cop?
- No. Just some guy.

214
00:11:52,899 --> 00:11:54,533
I play.

215
00:11:54,533 --> 00:11:57,803
- Yeah, you any good?
- Yes. I am, actually.

216
00:11:59,272 --> 00:12:03,376
Well, I'd say that we should hit
together sometime, but I'm lousy.

217
00:12:03,376 --> 00:12:04,977
Probably bore you.

218
00:12:06,913 --> 00:12:08,447
I'm not that good.

219
00:12:09,515 --> 00:12:11,183
Think I want this goddamn ulcer?

220
00:12:11,183 --> 00:12:14,020
- I didn't take that money.
- Nobody in here took anything.

221
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,455
- You gonna ask Shane about it?
- I'd bet on his loyalty...

222
00:12:16,455 --> 00:12:18,157
...before I'd bet on
your math skills.

223
00:12:19,725 --> 00:12:23,262
When we're done with this, I want you
to go back with Lem, count again.

224
00:12:23,262 --> 00:12:25,665
Check the lock for tampering.

225
00:12:25,665 --> 00:12:29,568
Got a picture of our homey.
Kaliel Wilks, a.k.a. Li'l Psych.

226
00:12:29,568 --> 00:12:31,537
- What took so long?
- No rap sheet.

227
00:12:31,537 --> 00:12:33,973
- Had his Marine Corps file.
- He's a jarhead?

228
00:12:33,973 --> 00:12:38,244
Was. Duked it out with his CO,
they booted him. Section Eight.

229
00:12:38,244 --> 00:12:41,113
Let's see how he feels with
our size 11s up his ass.

230
00:12:41,113 --> 00:12:43,449
We've got 90 minutes until the meet.

231
00:12:43,449 --> 00:12:45,351
Plainclothes has secured the area.

232
00:12:45,351 --> 00:12:47,486
We'll roll out in 10
to take our positions.

233
00:12:47,486 --> 00:12:49,055
ID'd our trigger boy.

234
00:12:49,055 --> 00:12:51,357
- Combat-trained.
- Shit.

235
00:12:52,692 --> 00:12:54,026
Make copies for everyone.

236
00:12:54,026 --> 00:12:56,729
Once Walon's secure, I'll make
the call to scoop up the Twelves.

237
00:12:56,729 --> 00:12:57,763
What if Trish isn't with them?

238
00:12:57,764 --> 00:13:00,199
Haul them here.
Make them tell us where she is.

239
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:02,835
The captain and I will set
up in a surveillance van.

240
00:13:02,835 --> 00:13:06,739
- How long's Trish been into this guy?
- He just popped up a few weeks ago.

241
00:13:06,739 --> 00:13:08,841
Walon kept her on the sidelines
until he needed her.

242
00:13:08,841 --> 00:13:12,812
She went to work at Polebusters,
got close to the Twelves.

243
00:13:12,812 --> 00:13:14,814
Polebusters? She's
under as a stripper?

244
00:13:14,814 --> 00:13:17,416
Cocktail waitress. She
cozied up to the bangers.

245
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:19,785
They bragged about their
murder-for-hire racket.

246
00:13:19,785 --> 00:13:21,654
She introduced them to Walon.

247
00:13:21,654 --> 00:13:23,990
And his murder they'll do for free.

248
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,158
Tell me what I have
to do to get back in.

249
00:13:26,158 --> 00:13:29,195
You hired a thief to break into
your home, a thief that...

250
00:13:29,195 --> 00:13:31,630
No jury's gonna believe
a murderer over a cop.

251
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:35,267
- Your sister-in-law corroborated him.
- My lawyer says it's hearsay.

252
00:13:35,267 --> 00:13:37,403
DA's spinning it, so the
department has no choice...

253
00:13:37,403 --> 00:13:39,372
...but to wash their hands.

254
00:13:39,372 --> 00:13:41,040
I need you to talk to them.

255
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,542
- Tommy, you can't come back.
- It wasn't my fault.

256
00:13:43,542 --> 00:13:47,346
I know you didn't mean for this to
happen. I can only imagine your pain.

257
00:13:47,346 --> 00:13:49,181
I can't have you working here.

258
00:13:49,181 --> 00:13:51,584
I'll do what I can so you
don't serve jail time.

259
00:13:51,584 --> 00:13:52,752
Jail time?

260
00:13:52,752 --> 00:13:55,521
You have to look out
for yourself now.

261
00:13:55,521 --> 00:13:57,056
And you still have friends here.

262
00:14:02,561 --> 00:14:03,829
Tommy?

263
00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:05,731
What are you doing, man?

264
00:14:05,731 --> 00:14:07,867
Aceveda's making me
clean out my locker.

265
00:14:08,701 --> 00:14:10,169
Walon and Trish are missing?

266
00:14:10,169 --> 00:14:12,438
Yeah, they fell off the
grid a few hours ago.

267
00:14:12,438 --> 00:14:13,739
- Let me help.
- Tommy.

268
00:14:13,739 --> 00:14:15,474
Just tell me what I can do.

269
00:14:16,008 --> 00:14:17,610
Why don't you come to the
house this weekend...

270
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:20,846
- ...we'll watch De La Hoya?
- Sure.

271
00:14:24,283 --> 00:14:26,752
What the hell is up with that guy?

272
00:14:27,486 --> 00:14:29,789
Doesn't look like he's bird-watching.

273
00:14:32,158 --> 00:14:34,860
- Hang on, pal.
- What's up?

274
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,363
Wanna tell me what
you're doing back here?

275
00:14:37,363 --> 00:14:38,697
Just now?

276
00:14:38,697 --> 00:14:40,433
Check the occupant.

277
00:14:40,433 --> 00:14:42,535
- Turn around. Hands behind your back.
- I have permission.

278
00:14:42,535 --> 00:14:44,336
- Hands behind your back.
- No...

279
00:14:49,942 --> 00:14:53,512
Sorry to bother you, sir. We just apprehended
a man looking through your window.

280
00:14:53,512 --> 00:14:55,548
Yo, girl.

281
00:14:55,548 --> 00:14:58,451
It's all good. Dude with her.

282
00:14:59,552 --> 00:15:00,653
What's wrong?

283
00:15:00,653 --> 00:15:02,721
Honey, tell them to
take these off me.

284
00:15:02,721 --> 00:15:05,558
- Do you know this man?
- Married to him long enough.

285
00:15:05,558 --> 00:15:07,326
- He's your husband?
- I told you.

286
00:15:07,326 --> 00:15:09,153
Look, No one's breaking the law
here officer.

287
00:15:09,154 --> 00:15:09,862
- We're just...
- Playing.

288
00:15:09,862 --> 00:15:12,698
Right. Role-playing
on the way to work.

289
00:15:12,698 --> 00:15:15,134
With our friend.

290
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:20,840
Six hours out there, all we
get is a practicing cuckold.

291
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,408
See something like
that, you wonder...

292
00:15:22,408 --> 00:15:25,010
...if we shouldn't stay
home, read the Bible.

293
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:29,281
Thanks, my partner already does that.
How you gonna solve this one?

294
00:15:29,281 --> 00:15:31,750
You don't hope for another victim.
But the fact is...

295
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:36,322
...this guy hasn't made the mistake's
gonna get him caught yet. Sorry.

296
00:15:36,322 --> 00:15:39,925
Yeah. Well, thanks a lot.

297
00:15:47,299 --> 00:15:49,401
See any Twelves yet? Or Walon?

298
00:15:49,401 --> 00:15:51,036
No, nothing yet.

299
00:15:52,838 --> 00:15:54,173
Sit tight.

300
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:06,919
Farmtown crew coming in.

301
00:16:07,853 --> 00:16:09,388
Any sign of Trish?

302
00:16:10,256 --> 00:16:11,857
<i>Negative.</i>

303
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,635
Psych's not with them either.

304
00:16:28,507 --> 00:16:30,009
I got Walon.

305
00:16:30,976 --> 00:16:32,778
- Where?
- You should see him.

306
00:16:32,778 --> 00:16:35,548
Shit. Trish isn't with him either.

307
00:16:38,484 --> 00:16:41,587
- Pick up Walon.
- Give Trish a few more seconds.

308
00:16:42,254 --> 00:16:44,023
They're gonna make him.

309
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,992
- Pick him up.
- I got it.

310
00:16:58,571 --> 00:17:00,806
Cover's been blown.

311
00:17:00,806 --> 00:17:02,408
Okay. Ready?

312
00:17:02,408 --> 00:17:03,976
Let's move on these assholes.

313
00:17:06,245 --> 00:17:08,414
Trish called the hello line.
It's a set-up.

314
00:17:08,414 --> 00:17:10,216
- Where is she?
- Still missing.

315
00:17:10,216 --> 00:17:12,251
- What do we know?
- Not much.

316
00:17:18,257 --> 00:17:20,526
- Stop those guys.
- Nah, We're gonna shake them down...

317
00:17:20,526 --> 00:17:21,961
- ... find out where Trish is.
- No.

318
00:17:21,961 --> 00:17:23,787
Li'l Psych will make her
as blowin' the whistle..

319
00:17:23,788 --> 00:17:24,897
Let these guys check in with him.

320
00:17:24,897 --> 00:17:27,233
Walon says we should
let these guys go.

321
00:17:27,233 --> 00:17:29,835
<i>Keep Trish's cover intact.</i>

322
00:17:29,835 --> 00:17:31,737
Trish can take care of herself.

323
00:17:37,776 --> 00:17:39,645
Pull them.

324
00:17:39,645 --> 00:17:42,748
<i>Shane, Ronnie, abort.
Abort.</i>

325
00:17:42,748 --> 00:17:44,416
I think I forgot my wallet.

326
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,088
<i>Let them go.</i>

327
00:17:52,491 --> 00:17:54,260
What do you mean, he didn't show up?

328
00:17:56,161 --> 00:17:58,163
Well, how'd he know not to show?

329
00:18:01,667 --> 00:18:03,602
I got one more job to do.

330
00:18:04,737 --> 00:18:07,273
I gotta grease that witness,
pick up a quick 10 grand.

331
00:18:07,273 --> 00:18:08,941
Then we get the hell out of town.

332
00:18:11,377 --> 00:18:12,778
Just sit tight.

333
00:18:16,615 --> 00:18:18,584
What you got for me, daddy?

334
00:18:22,988 --> 00:18:24,957
How do you say you met this cop?

335
00:18:24,957 --> 00:18:28,394
I didn't know he was a cop. Why we
gotta keep talking about this, boo?

336
00:18:30,396 --> 00:18:32,564
You know something, you
better spit it now.

337
00:18:32,564 --> 00:18:35,367
He's just some white cat
that I met up in the club...

338
00:18:35,367 --> 00:18:37,236
...wanted his business
partner killed.

339
00:18:38,237 --> 00:18:40,673
Please stop.
Please?

340
00:18:46,145 --> 00:18:48,180
- How long you known him?
- Few months.

341
00:18:49,882 --> 00:18:53,185
If he's a cop, then
I'm in deep shit too.

342
00:18:55,921 --> 00:18:57,423
I know.

343
00:18:59,091 --> 00:19:00,959
I'll take care of both of us.

344
00:19:02,728 --> 00:19:04,863
Yeah, I'll bet you will.

345
00:19:26,452 --> 00:19:27,753
Here...

346
00:19:29,121 --> 00:19:30,689
...sniff this.

347
00:19:31,924 --> 00:19:33,659
Real power shit.

348
00:19:39,264 --> 00:19:40,466
No.

349
00:19:42,301 --> 00:19:44,837
I want a clear mind our first time.

350
00:20:02,321 --> 00:20:04,857
We lost the Twelves in the subway.

351
00:20:04,857 --> 00:20:06,925
Didn't you have
surveillance detail in place?

352
00:20:06,925 --> 00:20:09,795
Well, the plan was to take everybody down.
You had us abort it.

353
00:20:09,795 --> 00:20:12,331
Look, every available
unit is in on this.

354
00:20:12,331 --> 00:20:14,967
- Who's shaking the trees?
- We're taking off right now.

355
00:20:14,967 --> 00:20:16,902
Any idea how you got made?

356
00:20:16,902 --> 00:20:18,971
Any idea?

357
00:20:18,971 --> 00:20:21,807
- It's the mole.
- What mole?

358
00:20:21,807 --> 00:20:24,610
The mole in the system,
the one I told you about.

359
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:28,213
Keeps warning the Twelves every time
a warrant or wiretap requests is put through.

360
00:20:28,213 --> 00:20:31,350
- We never discussed a mole.
- IAD's tracking it for me.

361
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:35,421
- It's in my case notes last week.
- I didn't see that.

362
00:20:35,421 --> 00:20:39,051
It's in the case notes. You
have people in the field...

363
00:20:39,052 --> 00:20:40,058
...and no clue what they're doing?

364
00:20:40,058 --> 00:20:43,829
Hey, easy. If there's a mole, it's not
Claudette's fault that you got made.

365
00:20:43,829 --> 00:20:46,665
It is if she's submitting
wiretap requests for us.

366
00:20:48,033 --> 00:20:50,702
- I sent one yesterday.
- Jesus.

367
00:20:50,702 --> 00:20:55,474
All right, I'll call IAD and see if
they're zeroing in on this mole.

368
00:20:55,474 --> 00:20:57,075
What else aren't you reading?

369
00:20:57,075 --> 00:21:00,746
You and Trish's names were not used
in the request. I only used the case number.

370
00:21:00,746 --> 00:21:03,449
- Her cover is still good.
- What if it's not?

371
00:21:03,449 --> 00:21:07,686
I must have read this quickly. This
mole thing just didn't register.

372
00:21:07,686 --> 00:21:10,722
I don't get her back in one
piece, I'll use every favor...

373
00:21:10,722 --> 00:21:14,726
...I've banked for the last 14
years to get your lazy ass fired.

374
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,498
Come on.

375
00:21:32,945 --> 00:21:36,181
Everyone seems to have heard of Li'l
Psych, but no one can locate him for us.

376
00:21:36,181 --> 00:21:38,183
- What do you got?
- IAD's first look into the mole.

377
00:21:38,183 --> 00:21:41,186
- They've only had the case a week.
- Oh, let me guess. They got shit.

378
00:21:41,186 --> 00:21:44,423
Not exactly. They've narrowed it
down to court offices on Hoover.

379
00:21:44,423 --> 00:21:47,292
- How many employees there?
- Twenty-six FTEs.

380
00:21:47,292 --> 00:21:49,795
Give me five minutes with them,
I'll find your mole.

381
00:21:49,795 --> 00:21:53,398
- What does five minutes entail?
- A shortcut you can live with.

382
00:21:53,398 --> 00:21:55,067
I'll come with you.

383
00:21:58,737 --> 00:22:01,340
- Ligature marks.
- Both strangled manually.

384
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,574
Time of death?

385
00:22:02,574 --> 00:22:05,511
Off the top of my
head, four hours ago.

386
00:22:05,511 --> 00:22:08,580
For Christ... I was
three blocks away then.

387
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:12,851
Landlord found them when he brought
the mail in. So, this one's her daughter.

388
00:22:12,851 --> 00:22:15,287
Been looking after her mom
every day, apparently.

389
00:22:15,287 --> 00:22:16,739
Goddamn it.

390
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,524
Always get this worked up
over a crime scene?

391
00:22:18,524 --> 00:22:20,192
I've been after this guy
for a month and a half.

392
00:22:20,192 --> 00:22:22,561
Now two people are dead because
I didn't catch him.

393
00:22:22,561 --> 00:22:25,030
Presence of semen on the
older victim's abdomen.

394
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,999
The other victim wasn't raped obviously?

395
00:22:26,999 --> 00:22:28,834
Have to wait for the
coroner's report.

396
00:22:28,834 --> 00:22:31,470
Three blocks. Horseshit.

397
00:22:31,937 --> 00:22:33,505
It's gotta be the Cuddler.

398
00:22:33,505 --> 00:22:35,874
Daughter came home,
interrupted the rape.

399
00:22:35,874 --> 00:22:40,145
Killed her, finished his business,
then murdered the older woman.

400
00:22:40,145 --> 00:22:43,382
Never gotten this violent. What
makes you so sure it's your guy?

401
00:22:43,382 --> 00:22:45,717
- It's him.
- Witness give you anything?

402
00:22:45,717 --> 00:22:47,119
What witness?

403
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:49,354
Saw a man leaving the
building this morning.

404
00:22:49,354 --> 00:22:52,391
Excuse me, ma'am. You saw someone
leaving this house earlier?

405
00:22:52,391 --> 00:22:55,327
- About 8. I was walking my dog.
- Did you get a good look at him?

406
00:22:55,327 --> 00:22:57,329
Well, he walked right past me.

407
00:22:57,329 --> 00:22:59,531
I was picking up after
my dog at the time.

408
00:22:59,531 --> 00:23:03,001
You know, not enough people
in this neighborhood do.

409
00:23:03,001 --> 00:23:07,039
You hear anything about Li'l Psych,
you just buzz me pronto, all right?

410
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,342
These aren't stolen, right? I'm not
giving my fiancée stolen shit.

411
00:23:10,342 --> 00:23:12,744
No. Look, it's on the
level, all right?

412
00:23:12,744 --> 00:23:14,179
Hey, check this one out, right,...

413
00:23:14,179 --> 00:23:16,915
...this brother caught
his fiancée bent over...

414
00:23:16,915 --> 00:23:18,884
...pulling a train
with his groomsmen.

415
00:23:18,884 --> 00:23:21,520
You can imagine his desire
to relieve himself of it.

416
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,854
I'm trying not to.

417
00:23:22,854 --> 00:23:25,090
- What else you got?
- Okay.

418
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:27,526
That's a killer piece of ice.

419
00:23:28,961 --> 00:23:30,662
What's the back-story?

420
00:23:30,662 --> 00:23:33,398
Diamond guy I know had a
bad run at the race track.

421
00:23:33,398 --> 00:23:35,934
So he unloaded a little
inventory on me below cost.

422
00:23:35,934 --> 00:23:37,469
Yeah, it's beautiful.

423
00:23:37,469 --> 00:23:39,104
Check out the four C's:

424
00:23:39,104 --> 00:23:41,773
Cut, clarity, carats and colour.

425
00:23:41,773 --> 00:23:44,142
Yeah, what about the fifth C, cost?

426
00:23:44,142 --> 00:23:46,645
- Two grand.
- Two grand.

427
00:23:46,645 --> 00:23:50,215
What? Listen, you give a girl a rock like that,
she will get on all fours for you...

428
00:23:50,215 --> 00:23:53,518
- ...and bark like a dog.
- She's my fiancée.

429
00:23:53,518 --> 00:23:55,454
Two G's will keep her that way.

430
00:24:02,494 --> 00:24:05,964
You got pounds of paperwork
coming at you every day.

431
00:24:05,964 --> 00:24:09,501
Detective duty on top of that.
Anyone could've missed it.

432
00:24:09,501 --> 00:24:11,069
Yeah.

433
00:24:11,069 --> 00:24:14,139
Your real problem was going
with the Decoy Squad...

434
00:24:14,139 --> 00:24:16,508
...and leaving your
starters on the bench.

435
00:24:17,676 --> 00:24:19,678
The gangs are our thing.

436
00:24:29,788 --> 00:24:32,024
- Okay, listen up.
- Attention, please.

437
00:24:32,024 --> 00:24:34,526
Police. Everybody on your feet.

438
00:24:34,526 --> 00:24:36,495
Let's go.

439
00:24:36,495 --> 00:24:39,398
You, you, you.

440
00:24:39,398 --> 00:24:42,200
You back there, and you two
in the corner. Come with me.

441
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,770
- What's this about?
- Police business. Keep typing.

442
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:46,738
I'm getting Judge Banks.

443
00:24:46,738 --> 00:24:48,774
Faster than that.

444
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:53,612
- Where you from?
- Detroit.

445
00:24:53,612 --> 00:24:55,847
- Santa Monica.
- Go sit down.

446
00:24:55,847 --> 00:24:57,516
- You?
- Jersey City.

447
00:24:57,516 --> 00:25:00,185
- Compton.
- You go, you stay.

448
00:25:00,185 --> 00:25:03,021
- You?
- Leimert Park.

449
00:25:03,021 --> 00:25:04,923
Inglewood.

450
00:25:04,923 --> 00:25:07,693
- Where'd you go to school?
- Belmont.

451
00:25:09,227 --> 00:25:10,829
- How about you?
- Wilson.

452
00:25:10,829 --> 00:25:13,965
Oh, that's bad for you.
It's not in Compton.

453
00:25:13,965 --> 00:25:17,035
- I moved to Farmington when I was 10.
- What block you live on?

454
00:25:17,035 --> 00:25:18,804
Earl Street.

455
00:25:18,804 --> 00:25:20,539
You two, split.

456
00:25:23,675 --> 00:25:26,144
- You know any Farmtown Twelves?
- Who didn't?

457
00:25:26,144 --> 00:25:28,380
- You been giving them a heads up of our warrant?
- No.

458
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:32,617
Sure you did. You gave up a wiretap
yesterday. You gave up a cop.

459
00:25:32,617 --> 00:25:34,586
- No.
- Here comes the judge.

460
00:25:34,586 --> 00:25:36,455
Listen, honey.
I'm gonna have the big boy here...

461
00:25:36,455 --> 00:25:39,057
...crawl up your ass, find out
who you been hanging with.

462
00:25:39,057 --> 00:25:43,095
How much you wanna bet he
finds gang ink on your taint?

463
00:25:43,095 --> 00:25:46,498
Answer now or spend the next
eight to 10 wishing you had.

464
00:25:47,332 --> 00:25:51,603
- Raheem Pyrums. Pretty Boy.
- What the hell is going on here?

465
00:25:51,603 --> 00:25:54,172
Judge Banks. We need a warrant.

466
00:25:54,172 --> 00:25:56,508
I'm gonna barely be able
to make rent this month.

467
00:25:57,509 --> 00:26:00,979
But the look on Mara's face
will make it all worth it.

468
00:26:03,849 --> 00:26:06,418
You think there's any
chance Vic took that money?

469
00:26:06,418 --> 00:26:07,886
What?

470
00:26:08,987 --> 00:26:13,558
He's getting a divorce,
a mortgage, rent.

471
00:26:13,558 --> 00:26:15,393
Kid with special needs.

472
00:26:15,393 --> 00:26:17,529
It's not like he hasn't
taken the money before.

473
00:26:17,529 --> 00:26:19,064
Shut the hell up.

474
00:26:22,701 --> 00:26:24,236
Who's Nancy?

475
00:26:26,204 --> 00:26:28,206
Police. Open up.

476
00:26:28,206 --> 00:26:31,676
Man, ease up on my door. That's real
oak, that ain't home-center shit.

477
00:26:31,676 --> 00:26:35,947
- Hands against the wall, Pretty Boy.
- Desiree.

478
00:26:35,947 --> 00:26:39,284
Spending a quiet day at home
with your man? Must be love.

479
00:26:39,284 --> 00:26:40,919
Turn around, honey. Spread them.

480
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:43,388
Y'all go on and search.
Ain't nothing on me.

481
00:26:43,388 --> 00:26:45,190
Sit your ass down, skid mark.

482
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:48,994
Looking for your boy Psych and
some bar skank he's hanging with.

483
00:26:48,994 --> 00:26:51,997
- We ain't seen or spoke in weeks.
- Really?

484
00:26:51,997 --> 00:26:55,033
I got a county clerk crying about
how she gave you and him...

485
00:26:55,033 --> 00:26:57,369
...some police intel just yesterday.

486
00:26:57,369 --> 00:27:00,639
Tell us where Li'l Psych and the woman
are, we'll forget we were here.

487
00:27:00,639 --> 00:27:02,140
Y'all don't know nothing.

488
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:04,976
I know a few things.

489
00:27:04,976 --> 00:27:07,112
Maybe a few that might surprise you.

490
00:27:09,581 --> 00:27:11,316
You wanna know what I know, Chunk?

491
00:27:11,316 --> 00:27:13,151
Just go on and tell them
where Psych at, Raheem.

492
00:27:13,151 --> 00:27:14,753
You shut your face, girl.

493
00:27:14,753 --> 00:27:17,856
Look, you said yourself he
was nothing but trouble.

494
00:27:17,856 --> 00:27:20,225
Why you think they call him psycho?

495
00:27:20,225 --> 00:27:22,727
Don't let that fool bring
the whole crew down.

496
00:27:24,229 --> 00:27:27,132
- Call him up.
- Hell, no.

497
00:27:27,132 --> 00:27:30,502
You know what, forget this. I
ain't messing with no fool.

498
00:27:30,502 --> 00:27:33,972
And I damn sure ain't waiting
around for no jailbird neither.

499
00:27:33,972 --> 00:27:36,808
Now, you call him or
I'm out the door.

500
00:27:39,678 --> 00:27:41,947
A little rounder.

501
00:27:41,947 --> 00:27:44,182
Yeah. Yeah, like that.
That's perfect.

502
00:27:44,182 --> 00:27:45,750
Let's see.

503
00:27:48,753 --> 00:27:52,257
- I thought you said you got a good look at him.
- Yeah, that's him.

504
00:27:52,257 --> 00:27:54,926
This is an ear attached to a head.

505
00:27:54,926 --> 00:27:57,395
It's a pretty good drawing.

506
00:27:57,395 --> 00:28:00,432
Did he have a couple of eyes?
Maybe a nose and a mouth?

507
00:28:00,432 --> 00:28:03,435
- Don't take that tone with me.
- This doesn't help us.

508
00:28:03,435 --> 00:28:05,904
He walked by quickly.

509
00:28:05,904 --> 00:28:09,474
And as I think I mentioned,
I was scooping poop at the time.

510
00:28:11,209 --> 00:28:13,545
I just heard.

511
00:28:13,545 --> 00:28:15,247
You okay?

512
00:28:17,449 --> 00:28:21,620
Aceveda didn't lift a finger for me.
What am I gonna do? Work security?

513
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:24,256
Hey, we all end up there
in 20 years anyway.

514
00:28:26,758 --> 00:28:30,228
Hey, Tommy. You got some pretty big stuff
hanging over your head right now.

515
00:28:33,265 --> 00:28:36,001
Hey, you got him to
give you your job back.

516
00:28:36,935 --> 00:28:38,136
Different situation.

517
00:28:38,136 --> 00:28:40,171
You know what to say.
Maybe he'll listen to you.

518
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,241
All right.

519
00:28:44,609 --> 00:28:48,413
- Oh, you don't wanna talk to him.
- No. Look, I will.

520
00:28:48,413 --> 00:28:50,649
- You think this was my fault.
- No, I don't.

521
00:28:50,649 --> 00:28:53,285
Look, you just name a night, Vanessa
and I will have you over for dinner.

522
00:28:53,285 --> 00:28:55,587
We can talk about
where you should go from here.

523
00:28:55,587 --> 00:28:58,556
Oh, you mean God's plan?
Yeah, thanks.

524
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:02,928
Appreciate it.

525
00:29:06,298 --> 00:29:08,333
Gotta do this hit and get paid.
Let's go.

526
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:11,703
I don't know why you dragging me
in this Kaliel. I don't wanna see that.

527
00:29:11,703 --> 00:29:14,973
You brought that cop in to buy a hit.
That makes you just as guilty.

528
00:29:15,874 --> 00:29:18,843
Might as well be in on the shit.
Yeah?

529
00:29:18,843 --> 00:29:20,578
Li'l Psych. Where you at?

530
00:29:21,246 --> 00:29:22,981
I'm going to that job on Doyle Street.

531
00:29:22,981 --> 00:29:26,017
- Already?
<i>- I'm about 10 minutes out.</i>

532
00:29:26,017 --> 00:29:29,054
- You know the spot, right?
- 2130 Doyle. Why?

533
00:29:29,054 --> 00:29:30,855
I'm just making sure you know.

534
00:29:30,855 --> 00:29:33,525
You holler back when you
finished, I'll cash you out.

535
00:29:35,593 --> 00:29:38,129
- What the hell are you doing?
- I got you an address, man.

536
00:29:38,129 --> 00:29:40,999
If I told him to stop,
he'd have known something was up.

537
00:29:46,571 --> 00:29:49,307
- Mark's in there?
- Ratted on a G, so his Christmas...

538
00:29:49,307 --> 00:29:53,511
- ...is getting canceled.
- Look, boo, the cops are after us.

539
00:29:53,511 --> 00:29:55,647
Maybe we should just
bounce on out of here.

540
00:29:55,647 --> 00:29:58,383
I don't get my paper till
this snitch starts leaking.

541
00:30:01,953 --> 00:30:03,488
It's on.

542
00:30:07,959 --> 00:30:10,962
No. What the hell you doing?

543
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:18,380
Let go.

544
00:30:43,294 --> 00:30:44,696
Vic.

545
00:30:49,234 --> 00:30:50,835
What happened? Trish.

546
00:30:53,138 --> 00:30:55,006
- Get an ambulance.
- Alright.

547
00:30:56,641 --> 00:30:57,942
Can you talk?

548
00:30:59,244 --> 00:31:02,180
Gray Monte Carlo. I got the plate.

549
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:08,520
- It says "To Nancy, Love Donald."
- Really?

550
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,723
I checked our computers. It was
reported stolen two weeks ago.

551
00:31:11,723 --> 00:31:13,792
Yeah, that sounds about right.

552
00:31:13,792 --> 00:31:15,756
I told you to get a
ring that wasn't hot.

553
00:31:15,757 --> 00:31:18,096
Yeah, but.. but..
but you gave me the code.

554
00:31:18,096 --> 00:31:20,432
- What code?
- Well, you winked.

555
00:31:20,432 --> 00:31:22,567
- Like.. like this was on the hush-hush.
- I didn't wink.

556
00:31:22,567 --> 00:31:24,469
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

557
00:31:24,469 --> 00:31:27,872
How did you expect to get
a $10,000 rock for 2, huh?

558
00:31:29,541 --> 00:31:31,676
Look, can you get me one
that's on the level or not?

559
00:31:31,676 --> 00:31:34,446
Yeah, but it's gonna
cost you like 3 or 4.

560
00:31:35,914 --> 00:31:39,417
Just get me a ring that I can use.

561
00:31:39,417 --> 00:31:41,186
Okay.

562
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:51,362
Paul and Chris spotted the
license-plate number you gave us.

563
00:31:51,362 --> 00:31:53,665
I had them hang on so
you could hook him up.

564
00:31:57,135 --> 00:31:58,837
Thanks.

565
00:32:05,543 --> 00:32:08,646
- At least your stuff was good.
- Let's go.

566
00:32:14,552 --> 00:32:16,421
It's a relief that you're all right.

567
00:32:16,421 --> 00:32:20,024
A little worse for the wear, but I
was never the Miss America type.

568
00:32:20,024 --> 00:32:22,427
I had to do some coke
to keep my cover.

569
00:32:24,562 --> 00:32:29,267
I'll put an injury on duty for you.
Do you need to see a doctor?

570
00:32:29,267 --> 00:32:32,670
I should get checked out for STDs.
Get the morning-after pill.

571
00:32:33,471 --> 00:32:35,473
Damn it.

572
00:32:37,742 --> 00:32:40,111
Well, if you feel like you need
to talk to somebody...

573
00:32:40,111 --> 00:32:42,480
I put a guy out of
the murder business.

574
00:32:43,348 --> 00:32:44,949
I'm okay.

575
00:33:00,265 --> 00:33:03,168
- I'm so sorry, Trish.
- That's cool.

576
00:33:03,168 --> 00:33:05,603
Of course, that may
be the coke talking.

577
00:33:08,273 --> 00:33:09,741
You ready?

578
00:33:18,449 --> 00:33:20,485
Hey. I didn't expect
to see you so soon.

579
00:33:20,485 --> 00:33:22,787
This is Hunter, my boyfriend.

580
00:33:23,555 --> 00:33:25,089
Can we talk to you?

581
00:33:25,823 --> 00:33:27,125
Sure.

582
00:33:44,943 --> 00:33:46,911
Tell him what you told me.

583
00:33:48,913 --> 00:33:50,448
Tell him.

584
00:33:52,584 --> 00:33:54,419
What happened today was a mistake.

585
00:33:55,019 --> 00:33:56,754
It can't happen again.

586
00:33:57,922 --> 00:33:59,524
And?

587
00:34:02,126 --> 00:34:05,597
I'm with Hunter. Don't call me.

588
00:34:07,632 --> 00:34:09,267
Got that?

589
00:34:18,276 --> 00:34:21,312
Elderly victim. Same geo-profile.

590
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:24,916
Apartment was visible from the street,
just like the others. It's gotta be him.

591
00:34:24,916 --> 00:34:27,051
Lucas said they found
semen at the crime scene.

592
00:34:27,051 --> 00:34:31,689
- I thought your guy didn't ejaculate.
- Maybe he found killing arousing.

593
00:34:33,391 --> 00:34:35,627
This guy makes the first
killings of his life...

594
00:34:35,627 --> 00:34:38,429
...and then spends the next
couple hours cuddling?

595
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:42,300
I thought the other rapes were in the
early evening. This was early morning.

596
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,969
Danny, you saw me put my
gun in my locker, right?

597
00:34:44,969 --> 00:34:46,304
Yeah, I think so.

598
00:34:46,304 --> 00:34:47,772
I can't find it.

599
00:34:50,675 --> 00:34:52,343
I'll be right back.

600
00:35:05,023 --> 00:35:07,792
Tommy? What are you doing?

601
00:35:08,626 --> 00:35:10,228
Walk away.

602
00:35:14,532 --> 00:35:16,100
Okay, Tommy, get out of the car.

603
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,000
- My lawyer says I should plead out.
- Look, man.

604
00:35:18,001 --> 00:35:18,870
You don't have to do anything
you don't want do.

605
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:21,172
I'd get less than a year
in a prison.

606
00:35:21,172 --> 00:35:23,341
We can make sure that
the truth comes out.

607
00:35:23,341 --> 00:35:26,110
- Truth is I probably deserve more.
- You don't. Come on.

608
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:28,346
We can talk about this.

609
00:35:28,346 --> 00:35:33,384
Look, man, you got people inside
who care about you. Julien, me.

610
00:35:33,384 --> 00:35:37,021
- We know what you're going through.
- Yeah, I can see that.

611
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,562
Let me talk to Aceveda.

612
00:35:45,263 --> 00:35:47,098
Okay. He's got pull.
He can use it if he wants to.

613
00:35:47,098 --> 00:35:49,500
I can make him
change his mind.

614
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,770
- So now you'll talk to him?
- Yeah. I should have done it before.

615
00:35:54,672 --> 00:35:57,542
Tommy, you still got family.
Let us help you.

616
00:35:58,676 --> 00:36:00,445
Okay.

617
00:36:00,445 --> 00:36:02,046
Get Aceveda.

618
00:36:06,484 --> 00:36:08,086
Give me the gun.

619
00:36:08,086 --> 00:36:11,222
Let's hear what Aceveda's
got to say first.

620
00:36:15,193 --> 00:36:16,661
Okay.

621
00:36:18,463 --> 00:36:20,064
All right, good.

622
00:36:24,435 --> 00:36:29,841
Hey, officer in distress. Outside.
Officer in distress. Officer in dis...

623
00:36:31,008 --> 00:36:33,244
- This way.
- Shot fired.

624
00:36:33,244 --> 00:36:34,879
What's going on?

625
00:36:36,814 --> 00:36:38,583
- Move, move.
- I got it.

626
00:36:38,583 --> 00:36:41,419
- Right there, keep down.
- Somebody radio for a paramedic.

627
00:36:41,419 --> 00:36:43,421
Radio for a paramedic.

628
00:36:43,814 --> 00:36:44,876
Need help.

629
00:36:53,713 --> 00:36:55,157
Alright. Come on, come on.
Let's go.

630
00:37:01,739 --> 00:37:04,175
The department's providing
a counselor tonight.

631
00:37:04,175 --> 00:37:06,411
You two can leave early to attend.

632
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:10,715
He was a coward.

633
00:37:10,715 --> 00:37:12,517
He thought the job
was all that he had left.

634
00:37:12,517 --> 00:37:15,219
Yeah, and we have to
clean up his mess again.

635
00:37:17,855 --> 00:37:19,924
Session's at 8:00 at
the Fischman Center.

636
00:37:19,924 --> 00:37:21,659
Thanks, I think I'll pass.

637
00:37:30,535 --> 00:37:32,003
- So?
- We're 7 G's short.

638
00:37:32,003 --> 00:37:33,371
Just like Ronnie said.

639
00:37:33,371 --> 00:37:35,006
- And the lock?
- Not a scratch.

640
00:37:35,006 --> 00:37:38,409
And besides, who's gonna steal seven
grand and leave a fortune behind?

641
00:37:50,488 --> 00:37:52,323
So which one of us did it?

642
00:37:57,895 --> 00:37:59,630
None of us did it.

643
00:38:03,067 --> 00:38:05,837
Look, this whole Tommy thing's
got us all a little raw.

644
00:38:05,837 --> 00:38:08,206
Ronnie reported the money missing.

645
00:38:08,206 --> 00:38:11,075
Lem didn't even wanna steal
it in the first place.

646
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:17,014
So when you gonna talk to him?

647
00:38:19,851 --> 00:38:23,788
- Day from hell, huh?
- Yeah, worst on record.

648
00:38:23,788 --> 00:38:27,358
If they don't realize it yet, you're
the one who got them back safely.

649
00:38:27,358 --> 00:38:30,127
I thought you were
talking about Tommy.

650
00:38:30,127 --> 00:38:31,696
That too.

651
00:38:34,732 --> 00:38:37,268
What about that murder-rape?

652
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:42,240
First it felt like the Cuddler,
but then I threw that out.

653
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,343
Your first instinct's pretty good.
What's your gut say?

654
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:49,747
The daughter showed up unexpectedly.
He killed her to keep from getting caught.

655
00:38:49,747 --> 00:38:53,851
The murder excited him. So much
so that he finally orgasmed.

656
00:38:53,851 --> 00:38:55,386
He gets off on murder?

657
00:38:55,386 --> 00:38:58,589
But why would he cuddle
for hours afterwards?

658
00:38:58,589 --> 00:39:02,293
Witness saw a man leaving the house
well after the time of death.

659
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:05,062
Maybe he left and came back.

660
00:39:05,062 --> 00:39:07,665
Came back to the house.
Bodies hadn't been discovered.

661
00:39:07,665 --> 00:39:08,866
See what he'd done.

662
00:39:08,866 --> 00:39:11,502
Show the whole world
just how potent who he really is.

663
00:39:11,502 --> 00:39:14,205
Sick.
It's plausible.

664
00:39:26,984 --> 00:39:29,287
You gonna see that counselor?

665
00:39:29,287 --> 00:39:32,223
There's something else
I've been putting off.

666
00:39:32,223 --> 00:39:37,295
Listen, Julien, sometimes suicide puts
thoughts in people's heads, you know.

667
00:39:37,295 --> 00:39:40,197
Why don't you go with me, see
what that guy has to say?

668
00:39:40,197 --> 00:39:43,701
That's the last thing on my mind right
now. I'm in a much better place.

669
00:39:43,701 --> 00:39:45,836
I've got Vanessa. Randall.

670
00:39:45,836 --> 00:39:49,540
- We're gonna start our own family.
- All right.

671
00:39:51,008 --> 00:39:53,311
Call me if you wanna talk.

672
00:39:53,311 --> 00:39:54,745
Okay.

673
00:39:58,215 --> 00:40:00,918
It's pretty late, sir. You've already
missed your last three appointments.

674
00:40:00,918 --> 00:40:04,589
I'm a cop. My schedule's kind of
crazy. Can you just get me in now?

675
00:40:04,589 --> 00:40:06,857
When you're done, place
the specimen here.

676
00:40:06,857 --> 00:40:09,560
There are some visual
materials there if you like.

677
00:40:11,228 --> 00:40:12,930
Okay.

678
00:40:34,585 --> 00:40:36,153
Where is she?

679
00:40:44,595 --> 00:40:45,930
Take it easy, man.

680
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:49,266
- Stay out of this.
- Hey, I'm with you.

681
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,402
Come here.

682
00:40:54,839 --> 00:40:56,540
She belongs behind a desk.

683
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:59,810
Not messing with what we do on the
street. Doesn't mean anything.

684
00:41:00,578 --> 00:41:04,081
- She's got Aceveda and the chief in her pocket.
- You think I give a shit about that?

685
00:41:04,081 --> 00:41:07,518
And she's been playing both of us
against each other from the jump.

686
00:41:07,518 --> 00:41:10,321
Now, if we start playing
ball together...

687
00:41:10,321 --> 00:41:13,457
She can't command if
we don't let her.

688
00:41:13,457 --> 00:41:15,693
Great minds think alike.

689
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:39,150
Do you need anything?
We're closing up in five minutes.

690
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:40,851
I'm fine.

691
00:42:26,964 --> 00:42:29,600
- Yeah?
- It's me.

692
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:33,170
<i>I'm sorry about before.
</i>He caught me in a lie.

693
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:34,839
<i>And he kept wanting more details.</i>

694
00:42:34,839 --> 00:42:37,341
- I just didn't wanna lie anymore.
- How are you?

695
00:42:37,341 --> 00:42:41,145
<i>I have some things I have to work out.</i>
I've been with him for four years and...

696
00:42:41,145 --> 00:42:42,546
I understand.

697
00:42:43,848 --> 00:42:46,984
<i>- Listen, don't do anything on my account.
</i>- I know.

698
00:42:46,984 --> 00:42:49,153
<i>Sorry you got put in this position.</i>

699
00:42:49,854 --> 00:42:51,255
I'm not.

700
00:42:52,356 --> 00:42:53,891
Okay.

701
00:42:54,358 --> 00:42:55,826
Okay.

702
00:43:04,468 --> 00:43:06,170
You think you can buy me off?

703
00:43:07,204 --> 00:43:09,006
Sit down.

704
00:43:09,006 --> 00:43:11,609
- I'm cleaning.
- Will you... just sit down.

705
00:43:11,609 --> 00:43:13,077
Come on, just sit down.

706
00:43:15,146 --> 00:43:18,082
Playing my favorite song's
not gonna work either.

707
00:43:31,428 --> 00:43:33,164
It's for the baby.

708
00:43:34,832 --> 00:43:38,002
- What if it's a girl?
- Just open it.

709
00:43:55,753 --> 00:43:57,421
It's incredible.

710
00:44:09,233 --> 00:44:12,102
I've just been such a pain.

711
00:44:12,102 --> 00:44:15,072
- It's just that being alone...
- Don't worry about it.

712
00:44:15,072 --> 00:44:18,075
- And dealing with my mother...
- You're not your mother.

713
00:44:19,176 --> 00:44:21,145
And I'm nothing like my father.

714
00:44:22,413 --> 00:44:24,181
This thing's gonna work.

715
00:44:26,083 --> 00:44:27,785
Baby.

716
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:35,659
- I love you.
- I love you too.

717
00:44:37,494 --> 00:44:38,963
Vic?

718
00:44:39,763 --> 00:44:42,666
Hey.
What's going on, man?

719
00:44:42,666 --> 00:44:44,235
- Bad timing.
- No.

720
00:44:44,235 --> 00:44:48,205
We are...
We just got engaged. Officially.

721
00:44:49,006 --> 00:44:50,407
Look.

722
00:44:52,209 --> 00:44:54,712
- That's nice.
- What's up, man?

723
00:44:55,346 --> 00:44:56,947
It can wait.

724
00:44:56,947 --> 00:44:59,250
- You sure?
- Yeah.

725
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:01,518
You celebrate.
Celebrate.

726
00:45:30,614 --> 00:45:32,049
Hello?

727
00:45:37,755 --> 00:45:40,090
Detective Wyms, sorry.
Can I help you?
