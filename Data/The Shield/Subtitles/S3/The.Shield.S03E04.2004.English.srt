1
00:00:00,901 --> 00:00:02,369
<i>Previously on "The Shield".</i>

2
00:00:02,369 --> 00:00:04,304
I'm going back to work.

3
00:00:04,304 --> 00:00:07,374
There's a nursing shortage,
and the pay is good.

4
00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:09,409
How's that gonna work with the kids?

5
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:11,845
People are wondering what you're
doing about the beating you took.

6
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:13,280
Still can't prove who did it.

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,915
Everybody here knows who did it.

8
00:00:14,915 --> 00:00:16,583
And they're watching you.

9
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:20,287
Julien, please!

10
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,858
I was thinking that we
both talk to Aceveda...

11
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,660
...about teaming up. It might
bring us back together.

12
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,429
Maybe but I like the
way things right now.

13
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:33,066
- I'm pregnant.
- Bullshit.

14
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:35,068
It was an accident.

15
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:37,738
- We'll get married.
- No!

16
00:00:42,276 --> 00:00:44,011
Hey.

17
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:47,080
Marry me.

18
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,050
David's bringing in the
Decoy Squad from Wilshire.

19
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,920
They're gonna be working with you. I'm
gonna be in charge of both teams.

20
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:56,790
I think you guys got the wrong room.

21
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,692
Wyms told us to shack up here.

22
00:00:58,692 --> 00:01:01,328
We're the Decoy Squad. We just
transferred in. I'm Walon.

23
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:03,163
Eddie, Annie, Trish.

24
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:05,832
- They'll be gone soon.
- Yeah, or we will.

25
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:07,501
They made 15 arrests last night.

26
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:09,469
We keep hauling in this many fish...

27
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:12,105
...we might need to
find you new digs.

28
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,376
You didn't hear, dude?
Shane's getting married.

29
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,348
Smokes for everyone.

30
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:24,718
Dutch.

31
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:27,788
This mean you're
coming off the market?

32
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:31,725
He's a family man now. He's gonna
be stuck at home with a rug rat.

33
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:33,860
You having a kid? Didn't
know you're married.

34
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,964
I'm not. Must've been an
immaculate conception.

35
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:40,901
Congratulations. Who is she?
She your cousin?

36
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:43,337
Vic.

37
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:46,306
Amazing thing is,
she's not a stripper.

38
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:49,343
How's Mara feeling?

39
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:51,578
She's got morning sickness already.

40
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:55,015
It's crazy, isn't it, man?
I'm gonna be a daddy.

41
00:01:55,015 --> 00:01:56,216
Yeah.

42
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,787
Listen, we haven't talked plans.
I don't know, we may just elope.

43
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:03,523
But whatever we do, I want you there.

44
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:04,992
Absolutely.

45
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:15,936
Someone call for a detective?

46
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,104
That was me.

47
00:02:17,104 --> 00:02:19,106
Mrs. Mackey? I didn't
know you worked here.

48
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:21,441
I just started. Corrine Mackey.

49
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:23,377
Dutch Wagenbach. Vic's wife?

50
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:27,147
Yeah, technically. Dr. Genty
asked me to call you.

51
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,850
- Hi.
- Doctor.

52
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,319
A patient came in with a bad
case of food poisoning.

53
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,122
- It's his third time this month.
- Fast food'll kill you.

54
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:37,290
Especially when it's
laced with thallium.

55
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,960
- Thallium. What's that?
- Poison.

56
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,630
Odorless, colorless, almost
impossible to detect.

57
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,166
Maybe someone's messing with
things at my grocery store.

58
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,434
We'll look into that.

59
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:50,737
Check other hospitals, see if they
have people with similar symptoms.

60
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:53,907
We need to make sure none of the
packages were tampered with.

61
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:56,743
Maybe it's a mix-up at the lab?
I mean, I feel better now.

62
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:58,745
We ran two different samples.

63
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:01,648
We have to ask, but...

64
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:04,151
Did you try to poison yourself?

65
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:05,552
God, no.

66
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:07,487
- No cell phones, please.
- Okay.

67
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:09,423
Where did you eat today?

68
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:12,893
Home. My brother stopped
by, we had breakfast.

69
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:14,928
What about the other
times you got sick?

70
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:18,231
- Home, I think.
- Your brother stop by then too?

71
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:19,966
Yeah. He feels awful.

72
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:23,203
I give him shit for being
such a terrible cook.

73
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,572
That was Aceveda. You're on your own.

74
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:30,043
What's up?

75
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:33,847
Thinking of transferring
off the team.

76
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:34,948
Why?

77
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:37,451
Not as much fun as I thought it'd be.

78
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:40,387
I'm not fitting in the
way that I wanted.

79
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:41,588
You're wanted.

80
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:45,158
- We're a tight bunch.
- There's no hard feelings.

81
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:48,395
You're cool, but...

82
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:50,931
Shane.

83
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:53,900
Look, I need to be somewhere
where I can be the go-to guy.

84
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:55,735
Detective?

85
00:03:56,736 --> 00:04:00,474
Just sit tight, okay? I got
plans for you. Trust me.

86
00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:02,976
Aceveda and Detective
Wyms need to see you.

87
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:12,719
Victim's Karen Rivas,
the homeless advocate.

88
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,655
She and her child were apparently
carjacked after a robbery.

89
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:18,091
Fortunately, the baby's fine.

90
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:21,461
The owner and his son. That's three
dead, including a public figure.

91
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:24,531
This is Claudette's case. Both
teams will take her lead.

92
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:27,701
Why both? We've knocked down
cases like this before.

93
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:29,302
- So have they.
- Don't worry, Mac man.

94
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:32,239
- You can back us up at the arrest.
- We huddle in five.

95
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:34,074
Get your marching orders.

96
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:37,978
Random crime. No video.
Media attention.

97
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:39,212
Lucky we're here.

98
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:41,348
Look, the boss ma'am's waiting.

99
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:44,151
What do you say we put
down a few notes on this?

100
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:46,820
First team to bring
in the shooter wins.

101
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,954
Who needs money?

102
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:51,057
Why don't we put up something that
really counts, like your pride?

103
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:54,294
All right, you guys lose,
Sasquatch has to take a bath.

104
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:56,863
Better yet, how about this?

105
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:58,965
The losing team streaks
through the Barn.

106
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:02,235
- Very 1 974 of you.
- You okay with that, daddy?

107
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:04,237
What sort of bet is that?
Put some money up.

108
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,006
- Yeah, be a man.
- Yeah.

109
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:08,575
Well, a real man puts his
dignity on the line.

110
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:10,377
Afraid your boys will fall short?

111
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:14,748
You guys have ladies. I gotta be
a gentleman, offer you an out.

112
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:17,851
Only ladies I see are you pussies
afraid to take this bet.

113
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:21,388
All right. You're on.

114
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:24,858
- And yours are gonna be off.
- Yeah, we'll see.

115
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:39,206
Rivas was driving a 1 999
white Mercedes S420.

116
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:40,908
Vic, put your guys on finding it.

117
00:05:40,908 --> 00:05:43,277
Get the license plate and VlN number.
Put out an APB.

118
00:05:43,277 --> 00:05:44,978
- Got it.
- Unis combed the crowd.

119
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:47,281
Of course, no one seems
to have seen anything.

120
00:05:47,281 --> 00:05:50,584
- Walon, you find somebody who has.
- Annie, hit this crowd up again.

121
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:53,787
Trish, across the street. Eddie,
hit the neighboring stores.

122
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:55,589
Two cases inside were cleared out.

123
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:57,491
The shooter was looking
for something.

124
00:05:57,491 --> 00:06:00,828
He couldn't get the register, took
something so it wasn't a bust.

125
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:02,529
Check if something's missing.

126
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,298
Ronnie, play bookworm.

127
00:06:04,298 --> 00:06:08,035
I know a fence who'll buy anything.
Maybe the stuff will end up there.

128
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,603
Find out what's missing, take Shane.

129
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:11,939
Better yet, I'll start
hitting the fences.

130
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:14,074
- Call with the info.
- I'll come.

131
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:15,375
Let us know?

132
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:17,211
Good luck.

133
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:20,047
If the killer dumped the
car, it'll turn up.

134
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:22,783
Since he didn't get the
till, maybe he flipped it.

135
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:24,551
Let's hit the chop shops.

136
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:27,121
- Good. Report anything to me.
- Okay.

137
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:30,624
Already got a witness.

138
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,926
It was horrible.

139
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:34,328
I heard shots,...

140
00:06:34,328 --> 00:06:37,264
...and then I saw this white guy
and this black girl run out...

141
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:39,933
...and they jacked this
lady's car, shot her dead...

142
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:42,169
...and threw her baby to the curb.

143
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:47,274
And all I could do was scream
for somebody to call 911.

144
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:52,412
How come you didn't report
what you saw immediately?

145
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,249
I went home to change,
put some makeup on.

146
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:57,651
- Why?
- I saw all the cameras.

147
00:06:57,651 --> 00:06:59,019
I need the tape.

148
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:02,990
I been out here for six months. You
can't land a gig without tape.

149
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,826
- You're an actress?
- You have any idea how tough it is?

150
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:08,595
Aren't you worried the killers
know you can identify them?

151
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:11,198
- They don't know my name.
- It's on the news, right?

152
00:07:11,198 --> 00:07:14,434
- But they won't know where I live.
- Are you in the phone book?

153
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:23,310
Y'all are gonna protect me, right?

154
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:25,679
- Edixon?
- All right.

155
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:28,615
Ronnie says the Decoy Squad
brought in some other witnesses.

156
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:31,251
Aceveda's definitely auditioning
them to replace us.

157
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:35,389
- Yeah, won't let it happen.
- Yeah, damn straight. Edixon. Hey.

158
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,758
Edixon!

159
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,794
Hey, it's getting harder to find you.

160
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:43,864
Took me all of two phone calls
today to track you down.

161
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:57,010
No.

162
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,081
- No Mercedes?
- No, no Mercedes.

163
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:09,957
Not another chop shop, Edixon.

164
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:12,392
Who's stealing for you?
Evil churro vendor?

165
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:15,495
- Now.
- Now!

166
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,797
Hey.

167
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:20,534
- lf I find Mercedes, I call, okay?
- Not good enough.

168
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:23,670
You're gonna tell everyone that you're
looking to buy. Pay top dollar.

169
00:08:30,277 --> 00:08:32,746
- Yo.
- Tavon, yo.

170
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:38,252
- This is my partner, Shane.
- What up?

171
00:08:38,252 --> 00:08:40,487
Listen, we're looking
for some things.

172
00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:42,189
They were taken from
Ling's over on 5th.

173
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:45,392
Saw it on the news.
Can't say I'm sorry.

174
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:48,028
Those rat slants
always did outbid me.

175
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:51,164
Still, that's a rough way
to go out of business.

176
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:53,200
- Haven't seen any of it.
- You sure?

177
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,802
If you shelled out cash,
you wouldn't wanna say.

178
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:58,438
Yeah, I'm sure.

179
00:08:58,438 --> 00:09:00,173
What you doing back there?

180
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:03,710
Like my partner says, just looking
for a little stolen bling-bling.

181
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,914
- Stuff involving a triple murder.
- And I don't have it.

182
00:09:06,914 --> 00:09:08,548
Yeah, what do you have?

183
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:12,753
- Yo, man, what's up with partner boy?
- Hey, Shane, Meaty's cool.

184
00:09:12,753 --> 00:09:14,321
If he says it ain't here, it ain't.

185
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:19,860
- Shit.
- Got a license to sell these?

186
00:09:20,294 --> 00:09:23,096
Serial numbers filed off.
There's four in the box.

187
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:26,133
Look, asshole. I said I
didn't see your shit.

188
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:27,634
Now, leave mine alone.

189
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:30,837
Yeah? You're under arrest.
Turn around, skinny, let's go.

190
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:32,839
Hey, Shane. Come on,
what are you doing?

191
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:35,976
- Being an asshole.
- Come on, if it turns up, he'll call.

192
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:37,711
- Not anymore.
- See?

193
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:41,648
You gonna stand there? Can I
get a little help, please?

194
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:45,385
Your cuffs, man. One pair just
isn't doing it for this cat.

195
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:50,157
Don't worry. There's thousands more.

196
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:53,126
Can we finish this later? My
15 minutes are ticking away.

197
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:56,596
- Sit down.
- The truth is, I saw the sister good.

198
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,832
But the white guy with
her, they all sort of...

199
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:01,368
It's hard to differentiate.
Know what I'm saying?

200
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:03,236
Keep looking.

201
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:05,639
City just posted a $5000 reward.

202
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:06,974
Reward?

203
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,880
We got a few chop shops paying
top dollar for '99 Benzes.

204
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,183
If our shooters dump
it, my CLs will call.

205
00:10:16,183 --> 00:10:17,684
What about the missing pawn items?

206
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:19,820
Ronnie went through the vic's ledger.

207
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:23,390
Turns out, all the missing items
were jewelry pawned by the same guy:

208
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,726
Dean Warrison.

209
00:10:25,726 --> 00:10:27,728
Maybe he came back for his stuff.

210
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:30,130
We went by his place,
he moved months ago.

211
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,599
Talking to associates to
track down his new crib.

212
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:35,035
Trying to figure out who the
Bonnie is to his Clyde.

213
00:10:35,035 --> 00:10:37,471
Robbery, breaking and
entering, drug possession.

214
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:38,772
Is that the man?

215
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:43,243
He's white. Could be.

216
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,245
Feels good. I'm gonna release...

217
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:47,280
...the make and model of
the car to the press.

218
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,583
Let them know we have two suspects.

219
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:52,786
How's the Decoy Squad doing?

220
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:56,723
Rivas' Amex card was used about
an hour ago at a gas station.

221
00:10:56,723 --> 00:10:59,026
Walon's talking to the
station clerk now.

222
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:05,065
Kevin, someone's trying
to kill your brother.

223
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:09,036
We found traces of a deadly poison,
thallium, in Robert's stomach.

224
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:11,571
That doesn't sound right.

225
00:11:11,571 --> 00:11:13,073
Especially since this is...

226
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:15,742
...the third time this month
he's been hospitalized for it.

227
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:18,979
You think he's trying
to kill himself?

228
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:22,215
That's an interesting theory.
Let's think it through.

229
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:24,851
Robert's got a decent job.
He's been there 12 years.

230
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,521
He owns his house. Seems
to have a lot of friends.

231
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:31,992
- No trouble dating. Healthy.
- Besides the food poisoning.

232
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:34,127
Besides the food poisoning.

233
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:37,297
So why would a guy like
that try to kill himself?

234
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,201
Depression?

235
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:44,471
Let's consider my theory.

236
00:11:44,471 --> 00:11:48,341
You're unemployed, been to rehab.
You're broke.

237
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,211
You really don't have a lot going on.

238
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:54,381
But Robert made you his
insurance beneficiary.

239
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,917
Then he suffers a
rash of poisonings...

240
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:59,686
...all after you come over
to cook food for him.

241
00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:01,588
A guy can't cook his
brother breakfast?

242
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:06,126
Look at the facts, Kevin.
You cook, he gets poisoned.

243
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:08,628
It's a little perspicuous,
don't you think?

244
00:12:09,463 --> 00:12:12,065
You don't know what
"perspicuous" means, do you?

245
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,436
You think you're smart
enough to lie to me?

246
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:19,005
You think you're smart
enough to convince me...

247
00:12:19,005 --> 00:12:21,274
...you had nothing to do with this?

248
00:12:22,676 --> 00:12:26,113
"Perspicuous" means obvious.

249
00:12:26,113 --> 00:12:29,382
Well, it's obvious you're a xxxx.

250
00:12:35,489 --> 00:12:37,657
Talked to one of Dean
Warrison's drug buddies.

251
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:40,393
Hasn't seen him, heard he moved
in with some black girl.

252
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:43,430
- Our Bonnie. What's the address?
- Still working on it.

253
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,831
Well, work harder.

254
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:48,902
Our killer's running around out there.
I don't wanna be running buck-naked.

255
00:12:48,902 --> 00:12:51,338
Well, I got nothing to
be embarrassed about.

256
00:12:51,338 --> 00:12:53,240
If I'd known, I'd have waxed my back.

257
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,143
I seen you in the shower. It's not
your back you need to worry about.

258
00:12:56,143 --> 00:12:58,078
We gotta ID the girl.

259
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:00,647
His jacket said he was in rehab.
Run that down.

260
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:02,215
- Maybe they met there.
- All right.

261
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:05,285
I've been fielding calls from
chop shops. Nothing so far.

262
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,420
Take the mug shot
around to local motels.

263
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,689
- See if he's holed up somewhere.
- Good idea.

264
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:11,958
- Whose mug shot?
- Nobody.

265
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:16,463
- That's cold.
- Not as cold as you're gonna be.

266
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:20,033
I'm gonna crank up the a.c. in the
clubhouse so your sac shrinks.

267
00:13:24,004 --> 00:13:25,572
I'll shrink your sac.

268
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:28,041
Detective, you know Carlos.

269
00:13:28,742 --> 00:13:29,976
Daily News.

270
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:32,879
Carlos is gonna cover
our investigation...

271
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:35,015
...for a piece in the
Sunday magazine.

272
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:37,450
He's to have unlimited access.

273
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:40,387
- How did you get that assignment?
- It was your captain's idea.

274
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:44,824
Sir, chief of police is on the phone.

275
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,128
Tell him I'll call back.

276
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:50,730
Have a seat.

277
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,465
We'll get you started in a minute.

278
00:13:58,405 --> 00:14:01,041
- I know you like the limelight...
- It's not about me.

279
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:03,543
A good Samaritan gets killed
while running errands?

280
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:07,380
It feeds into everyone's bad
perceptions about Farmington.

281
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,217
How's this piece gonna read if
this case doesn't get solved?

282
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:12,519
We have a suspect. We're
gonna solve this.

283
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,221
It's never a slam-dunk.

284
00:14:14,221 --> 00:14:17,757
You said you have everything
you need to crack this.

285
00:14:17,757 --> 00:14:20,460
So let's turn this press
coverage into a positive.

286
00:14:24,431 --> 00:14:27,000
See about getting you
three square meals.

287
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,602
- Vic.
- What's up?

288
00:14:28,602 --> 00:14:32,172
Shane arrested my Cl. He ruined
a five-year relationship.

289
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:35,075
- He's making me look like a punk.
- All right.

290
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:38,812
- What's going on?
- Caught Fatboy Slim here...

291
00:14:38,812 --> 00:14:41,181
...filing serial numbers
off a few handguns.

292
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:44,017
What's this have to
do with our homicide?

293
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:46,086
Nothing. He's got his
head up his ass.

294
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:47,721
And I told him, back off.

295
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:50,156
Hey, you don't tell me anything.
I tell you.

296
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:52,192
When Vic's not around,
I am in charge.

297
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:53,893
My lead. My guy.

298
00:14:54,661 --> 00:14:55,962
You believe this?

299
00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:58,164
- Kick him.
- Kick him?

300
00:14:58,164 --> 00:15:00,200
Look, I don't have time
for this bullshit.

301
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,236
We're trying to catch a killer
before the Decoy Squad does.

302
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:06,206
- Sorry, brother.
- No need. You ain't the bitch.

303
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:08,675
Hey, I just did you a favor.

304
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:11,878
Open your mouth one more time,
you'll be begging me to lock you up.

305
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:14,614
Now get out. Get out. Take your shit.

306
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:26,026
What was that about?

307
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:29,195
Passionate people having
a difference of opinion.

308
00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:30,864
Trust me, it works.

309
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:36,436
Can I speak to you?

310
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:39,839
Guess I'll take advantage
of that unlimited access.

311
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:45,712
I went a little too far with the
poisoning victim's brother.

312
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:47,781
How'd you do that?

313
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:50,950
You were here with your photo shoot
and I was up there by myself.

314
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,385
So it's my fault?

315
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:56,056
I was trying something new.

316
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:59,793
Trying to... You know, a
curveball to my fastball.

317
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:01,695
Don't tell me you played bad cop.

318
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:04,964
- You weren't up there to stop me.
- I knew you could handle this.

319
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,267
Ninety percent of the time, yes.

320
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:11,371
But 10 percent, there's
a connection. We...

321
00:16:11,705 --> 00:16:16,876
- It's like you...
- Please don't say I complete you.

322
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:21,047
Go up there and give
it one more shot.

323
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:23,683
You will go to a doctor,
get checked out.

324
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:25,185
I spend thousands of dollars...

325
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:26,619
Are you coming?

326
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:28,521
Yeah.

327
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:30,657
It's Julien's house.

328
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,669
We got a call about a disturbance.

329
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:43,837
Can we come in?

330
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:47,107
Sure.

331
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:53,913
Hey, Julien.

332
00:16:59,753 --> 00:17:03,089
- Maybe we should go?
- No. No, it's okay.

333
00:17:03,757 --> 00:17:05,291
It was just verbal.

334
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,994
I didn't realize it
had gotten that loud.

335
00:17:07,994 --> 00:17:10,363
Actually, the call came
from this address.

336
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:11,698
What?

337
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:14,968
Randall.

338
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:18,204
Randall?

339
00:17:19,172 --> 00:17:20,540
Randall.

340
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:24,010
Did you call 911, honey?

341
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:27,480
Baby, I'm sorry. We
didn't mean to scare you.

342
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,516
Mind if I speak to the boy, ma'am?

343
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:34,187
- Go ahead.
- I'm gonna have to talk to Vanessa.

344
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:43,396
- Everything okay?
- Yes.

345
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,965
Are you feeling threatened or unsafe?

346
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:47,934
Lord, no. No.

347
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:51,237
Look, everything is fine.

348
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,973
He has been through so
much and it's hard on him.

349
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:56,810
The shame, the stress.
The surgery just...

350
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:59,345
- Surgery?
- For his back.

351
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:02,515
After the beating. He's already
had one and it still hurts him.

352
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:05,084
He might need another one.

353
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:07,387
I didn't know.

354
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:11,524
Randall just got scared, that's all.

355
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:14,461
We're all right.

356
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:20,867
The Decoy Squad got a call from
a motel clerk who saw the car.

357
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:23,736
- They're talking with him now.
- I got one better.

358
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:26,706
Got an ID on Dean Warrison's
roommate, the black female.

359
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:28,241
Her name is Danielle Riggs.

360
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:32,745
- You show the picture to the witness?
- ID'd her as one of the carjackers.

361
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:35,615
- Nice work.
- Thanks. More to do.

362
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,617
What was that before?
Tavon and Shane.

363
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,586
It's just two dogs humping.

364
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:42,355
If you can't pry them loose,
I can get my hose out.

365
00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:43,556
I can handle it.

366
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:45,391
The Decoy Squad is working very well.

367
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:47,393
I don't want any worries
with your team.

368
00:19:09,516 --> 00:19:11,718
You know they ain't in there.

369
00:19:11,718 --> 00:19:14,254
I saw them both leave
early this morning.

370
00:19:15,522 --> 00:19:16,823
Check it out.

371
00:19:20,727 --> 00:19:22,128
Is this Danielle?

372
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:24,430
Is that her?

373
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:27,200
Yeah, that's her. She
left with the white boy.

374
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,269
- Damn it.
- All clear.

375
00:19:36,643 --> 00:19:38,044
Here you go.

376
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:42,582
Robert's gonna stay in the hospital
overnight. Just for observation.

377
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:44,050
It's nothing to worry about.

378
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:47,053
So...

379
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:49,022
Listen.

380
00:19:49,556 --> 00:19:51,090
I spoke to him again.

381
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,359
He...

382
00:19:53,927 --> 00:19:55,528
He really cares about you.

383
00:19:55,962 --> 00:19:57,964
Practically threw me
out of his room...

384
00:19:57,964 --> 00:20:00,199
...when he found out we
were talking to you.

385
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,969
I can see there's a real bond there.

386
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:05,939
He says you've really
been trying hard lately.

387
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:09,008
- Is that what he said?
- Yeah.

388
00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:12,645
You've blown a few
opportunities in the past...

389
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:14,714
...he's needed to bail you out.

390
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:17,050
Says it's added up to 1
5 grand over the years.

391
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,885
It's only 14.

392
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:21,821
The other investors hadn't gotten cold
feet and pulled out, then, you know...

393
00:20:22,522 --> 00:20:24,223
You're one of these guys...

394
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,893
...who, it doesn't work out,
you just blame someone else?

395
00:20:27,961 --> 00:20:30,964
And you're one of these guys
who's always just a xxxx.

396
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:39,639
I saw you and Lucas responded
to a domestic at Julien's.

397
00:20:40,974 --> 00:20:43,509
- How did you know about that?
- New policy.

398
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:46,779
Any 91  call at an officer's
home address is flagged.

399
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:49,282
Everything all right?

400
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:51,317
Yeah, it was nothing.

401
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:53,586
Then why didn't you
put it in the report?

402
00:20:54,354 --> 00:20:57,223
I brought you back to
be straight with me.

403
00:20:57,223 --> 00:20:59,492
I thought our deal was
if I saw anything.

404
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:02,629
All I saw was a
husband-wife argument...

405
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:05,164
...and a kid who got
scared and called 911.

406
00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:07,533
No special treatment.

407
00:21:09,302 --> 00:21:13,006
There's a complaint against
Julien for excessive force.

408
00:21:13,006 --> 00:21:14,374
Now this.

409
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,978
- Should I be worried for him?
- I'll talk to him. I'll let you know.

410
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:21,214
Lem and Tavon are sitting
on the apartment.

411
00:21:21,214 --> 00:21:23,549
Shane and Ronnie are running
down the girl's family.

412
00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:26,119
If they're still in town,
we're gonna nail them.

413
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:29,155
- You won't have to look far.
- We got him.

414
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:31,691
Interrogation 1.

415
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:38,464
- You brought in our guy?
- Looks that way.

416
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:43,836
How'd you find him?

417
00:21:43,836 --> 00:21:46,472
Claudette gave us his sheet,
saw the drug-possession bust.

418
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:49,509
We followed up, discovered a
treatment program he attended.

419
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:52,512
We sat on a few methadone
clinics and bingo.

420
00:21:53,746 --> 00:21:56,315
- You busted him based on my tip.
- Yeah.

421
00:21:56,315 --> 00:22:00,820
Speaking of tips, give us a
little preview. Cut or uncut?

422
00:22:05,292 --> 00:22:08,095
Heard about the shooting
at the pawnshop, Dean?

423
00:22:08,095 --> 00:22:10,497
Not really, no.

424
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:13,200
Three people dead, shooter
runs out with jewellery.

425
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,503
Chains, rings, bracelets.
All stuff you hocked.

426
00:22:18,071 --> 00:22:20,140
Just put him at the scene already.

427
00:22:21,441 --> 00:22:23,977
Got a witness who saw you
run out of the store.

428
00:22:24,444 --> 00:22:26,913
- I wasn't there.
- Sure, you were.

429
00:22:27,481 --> 00:22:29,282
You and Danielle.

430
00:22:33,153 --> 00:22:34,921
I didn't go in that shop.

431
00:22:35,622 --> 00:22:39,059
It was Danielle and
my friend Crazyhouse.

432
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:41,828
- Crazyhouse?
- Danielle's boyfriend.

433
00:22:41,828 --> 00:22:43,997
Got out of prison a
couple months ago.

434
00:22:45,298 --> 00:22:47,100
He shot those people. Not me.

435
00:22:47,868 --> 00:22:49,536
<i>Make me believe.</i>

436
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:51,671
I drove them there, but
I stayed in the car.

437
00:22:51,671 --> 00:22:54,608
- He's not the shooter.
- I believe him. Start stripping.

438
00:22:54,608 --> 00:22:58,111
<i>I've been staying with Danielle.
</i>Haven't been hitting her, though.

439
00:22:58,111 --> 00:23:01,381
I needed cash, so I hocked a few
things. She didn't miss them.

440
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:02,949
Get to it.

441
00:23:02,949 --> 00:23:05,819
Crazyhouse starts asking about
the jewellery he gave her.

442
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:08,288
I fessed up. He freaked out.

443
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:11,358
Made me drive them to the shop.
I stayed in the car.

444
00:23:11,358 --> 00:23:13,126
When I heard shots...

445
00:23:13,126 --> 00:23:14,694
...I jumped, man.

446
00:23:14,694 --> 00:23:17,197
Man, he must have jacked
that car after I split.

447
00:23:18,031 --> 00:23:20,167
And I didn't know he
was gonna kill no one.

448
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:23,937
- He's not the shooter.
- Accomplice.

449
00:23:23,937 --> 00:23:25,472
We said the shooter.

450
00:23:25,472 --> 00:23:27,440
I don't know what
you're talking about.

451
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,777
You've got the killer's name
and his girl. Find them.

452
00:23:31,511 --> 00:23:32,879
You're welshing?

453
00:23:32,879 --> 00:23:35,182
The bet was who'd find
the shooter first.

454
00:23:35,182 --> 00:23:37,918
That guy's the driver.
Are you welshing?

455
00:23:37,918 --> 00:23:40,487
Okay. Bet's still on.

456
00:23:42,355 --> 00:23:43,590
Yeah.

457
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,963
Got a little tip about the
missing car. See you.

458
00:23:51,131 --> 00:23:54,067
It's half now, half later.
That's always been our deal.

459
00:23:54,067 --> 00:23:56,736
Police. Hands up. Up.

460
00:23:58,238 --> 00:23:59,472
Looking for someone?

461
00:23:59,472 --> 00:24:01,741
Hear you're looking
to ditch a '99 Benz.

462
00:24:03,043 --> 00:24:05,645
Sorry, can't help you. Right, Eddie?

463
00:24:05,645 --> 00:24:08,014
Don't shoot. Who are you?

464
00:24:08,014 --> 00:24:11,451
God. Cut the crap. You set me up.

465
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:14,821
- You're making an awful mistake.
- I don't think so.

466
00:24:14,821 --> 00:24:16,623
I know who you are.

467
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:18,792
Long-lost friend.

468
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:21,294
Trying to dump off Rivas' car.

469
00:24:21,294 --> 00:24:23,730
She might be able to
lead us to the shooters.

470
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,599
How come you never called?

471
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:30,437
Hey, Vic.

472
00:24:32,939 --> 00:24:35,308
Thought you forgot my name.

473
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:37,644
- Welcome back.
- Yeah.

474
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:39,946
- How's it going?
- It's good.

475
00:24:39,946 --> 00:24:42,282
I hear you're mentoring
Julien, sort of.

476
00:24:42,949 --> 00:24:45,719
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

477
00:24:45,719 --> 00:24:47,153
You looking out for him?

478
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:49,723
I just told Julien to
stand up for himself.

479
00:24:49,723 --> 00:24:52,626
You mean like with Carlson
and his broken arm?

480
00:24:52,626 --> 00:24:55,662
I don't know how
Carlson broke his arm.

481
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:57,597
I know no one's gonna
be giving Julien...

482
00:24:57,597 --> 00:24:59,666
...another blanket
party anytime soon.

483
00:25:03,003 --> 00:25:05,505
<i>So I hear you're going
</i>to the city council.

484
00:25:06,673 --> 00:25:08,408
I just won the primary.

485
00:25:08,408 --> 00:25:10,510
The general election
isn't for a few months.

486
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:13,480
Well, yeah, but you're
running unopposed, right?

487
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:19,119
Wait until all the votes are in before
making me the second Mrs. Aceveda.

488
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:22,689
<i>Well, I'm sure the first Mrs. Aceveda
</i>will have an objection or two.

489
00:25:24,057 --> 00:25:26,826
Are your suspects usually so flirty?

490
00:25:26,826 --> 00:25:29,529
No. Who are you?

491
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:31,631
...jacked that car you
were trying to sell.

492
00:25:31,631 --> 00:25:33,833
They left three people dead.

493
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:35,835
Where are they?

494
00:25:35,835 --> 00:25:37,737
I understand there's a reward.

495
00:25:37,737 --> 00:25:40,073
For information leading
to their arrest.

496
00:25:40,073 --> 00:25:44,177
I don't know where they are. I mean,
I just work for a car broker.

497
00:25:44,177 --> 00:25:47,047
They called, said they were
looking to dump a '99 Benz.

498
00:25:47,047 --> 00:25:48,648
I heard Edixon was buying.

499
00:25:48,648 --> 00:25:51,951
I didn't know it was the ride you
were looking for till I was arrested.

500
00:25:51,951 --> 00:25:54,454
So you never spoke to these people?

501
00:25:54,454 --> 00:25:55,922
No.

502
00:25:57,357 --> 00:25:59,726
But I can tell you where the car is.

503
00:25:59,726 --> 00:26:03,963
I was careful. All that pristine
evidence, just sitting there.

504
00:26:05,432 --> 00:26:07,033
And what will it cost me?

505
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,269
Just the reward.

506
00:26:09,269 --> 00:26:10,704
Up front.

507
00:26:10,704 --> 00:26:12,405
And my boss and I walk.

508
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:16,576
Hasn't talked to our shooters? She
knows more than she's saying.

509
00:26:16,576 --> 00:26:18,178
We've gotta find that car.

510
00:26:18,178 --> 00:26:20,213
I'm gonna give her immunity.

511
00:26:20,213 --> 00:26:23,083
Kick her. Let me follow her.
See what she's playing.

512
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:25,318
The lead on the vehicle,
need us to run it?

513
00:26:25,318 --> 00:26:27,587
Sure. Car thief just gave up the car.

514
00:26:27,587 --> 00:26:29,889
Give me a sec. I'll give
you the exact location.

515
00:26:31,825 --> 00:26:34,494
- Where have you been?
- Working a triple murder.

516
00:26:34,494 --> 00:26:36,896
I can't get anywhere with the brother.
He hates me.

517
00:26:36,896 --> 00:26:40,200
- Did you go through the house?
- No traces of thallium anywhere.

518
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,670
If he doesn't confess, he's gonna
walk out of here and do it again.

519
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:47,907
Robert totally trusts him. He can't
believe his brother poses any threat.

520
00:26:47,907 --> 00:26:49,976
What do you want me to do?

521
00:26:49,976 --> 00:26:55,315
Let's recapitulate. Your
brother is a success.

522
00:26:56,249 --> 00:26:58,618
You are not.

523
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:03,390
Your brother has lots of money.

524
00:27:04,424 --> 00:27:06,559
You're in the negative.

525
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:09,562
Your brother is a well-adjusted,
caring individual.

526
00:27:09,562 --> 00:27:11,131
You...

527
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:13,099
...are fratricidal.

528
00:27:13,099 --> 00:27:15,568
Which means, you're going to jail.

529
00:27:17,337 --> 00:27:20,039
Is that perspicuous enough for you?

530
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:23,977
Perspicuous. You remember or
should I get a dictionary?

531
00:27:25,011 --> 00:27:27,914
- What the hell's going on?
- I'm interrogating a suspect.

532
00:27:29,482 --> 00:27:31,084
What is this shit?

533
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:34,921
Would you step outside?

534
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:49,602
<i>Sorry. He's got an uncle
</i>higher up on the force.

535
00:27:49,602 --> 00:27:51,938
<i>- We can't get rid of him.
</i>- She's playing him.

536
00:27:51,938 --> 00:27:53,239
I got here on merit.

537
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:56,676
I've been doing this job a
lot longer than he has.

538
00:27:56,676 --> 00:27:59,279
And he's always trying
to teach me something.

539
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,682
Like I don't know what I'm doing.
Sorry.

540
00:28:02,682 --> 00:28:05,018
I get worked up just
thinking about it.

541
00:28:06,586 --> 00:28:08,521
- I get it.
- Yeah?

542
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:11,090
<i>- I know someone like that.
</i>- No offense...

543
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:14,260
...he can't possibly be this bad.

544
00:28:18,832 --> 00:28:21,067
So, what are you gonna
do about Tavon?

545
00:28:21,067 --> 00:28:22,936
Booting the black guy on the team...

546
00:28:22,936 --> 00:28:26,172
...isn't gonna win us any favors
with a Hispanic captain...

547
00:28:26,172 --> 00:28:28,842
...a black chief or a black nanny.

548
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:31,678
Besides, we need him.

549
00:28:31,678 --> 00:28:33,680
- For what?
- He's an outsider.

550
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,882
He keeps us sharp about
the Money Train.

551
00:28:35,882 --> 00:28:39,118
Bullshit. We never needed him before.

552
00:28:39,118 --> 00:28:41,421
It's my call. Live with it.

553
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,465
<i>All right, now this could be it.</i>

554
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:09,749
Man, she's fast.

555
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:13,152
- All right, move in, boys. Move in.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

556
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:18,992
- Get out. Hands up.
- Get out!

557
00:29:18,992 --> 00:29:20,293
Hands up. Get over here.

558
00:29:20,293 --> 00:29:22,362
- Out of the car!
- Get out!

559
00:29:22,362 --> 00:29:23,863
Against the car.

560
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:27,734
Man, twice in one day.

561
00:29:27,734 --> 00:29:29,836
Damn. It's a good
thing we're friends.

562
00:29:29,836 --> 00:29:32,038
- Is that your car?
- No, but I have immunity.

563
00:29:32,038 --> 00:29:34,440
- No, not on this one, you don't.
- Vic.

564
00:29:35,542 --> 00:29:37,243
You talked to the shooter.

565
00:29:37,243 --> 00:29:41,681
Now, save the snow jobs for Aceveda
because I will press charges on this.

566
00:29:41,681 --> 00:29:44,150
They sold us the stolen Mercedes.

567
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:45,685
They need a new car
to get out of town.

568
00:29:45,685 --> 00:29:47,787
Hon, just let me handle this, okay?

569
00:29:47,787 --> 00:29:51,424
We were gonna do the deal and then
we were gonna turn them in. I swear.

570
00:29:51,424 --> 00:29:53,359
They were gonna pay
you for the wheels...

571
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:55,194
...and you were gonna get the reward.

572
00:29:55,194 --> 00:29:56,596
Something like that.

573
00:29:56,596 --> 00:29:57,997
I got a new plan.

574
00:30:05,505 --> 00:30:07,640
Man, I hope these two
idiots don't blow it.

575
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:11,945
I'm worried about chucklehead. The
future Mrs. Aceveda'll do just fine.

576
00:30:11,945 --> 00:30:14,080
Give me a second. Yeah?

577
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,448
Vic, Cassidy's missing.

578
00:30:15,448 --> 00:30:16,983
- What?
<i>- She's missing.</i>

579
00:30:16,983 --> 00:30:19,018
The sitter thought she
was in her room...

580
00:30:19,018 --> 00:30:20,620
...but when I got home, she's gone.

581
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,522
- Did she run away?
<i>- I think so.</i>

582
00:30:22,522 --> 00:30:24,524
<i>Call the police.</i>

583
00:30:24,524 --> 00:30:25,959
They're on their way over.

584
00:30:25,959 --> 00:30:27,594
I'll be right there.

585
00:30:27,594 --> 00:30:28,828
Cassidy's missing.

586
00:30:28,828 --> 00:30:30,697
- What do we do?
- Just get these guys.

587
00:30:30,697 --> 00:30:33,266
Hey, wait a second, man.
Who's in charge?

588
00:30:33,266 --> 00:30:35,435
We're a team. Just get it done.

589
00:30:41,274 --> 00:30:42,442
Any word?

590
00:30:42,442 --> 00:30:44,611
I've called her friends.
No one's seen her.

591
00:30:44,611 --> 00:30:47,180
- Set a perimeter?
- We have six units on it.

592
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,915
Juvenile detectives
have been notified.

593
00:30:48,915 --> 00:30:50,317
They'll set up a command center.

594
00:30:50,317 --> 00:30:51,752
Good. Okay.

595
00:30:52,586 --> 00:30:54,221
Her bike's missing.

596
00:30:54,221 --> 00:30:56,923
Good. Probably means
she left on her own.

597
00:30:56,923 --> 00:30:58,992
- Where would she go?
- I don't know.

598
00:30:58,992 --> 00:31:00,861
- Think.
- I'm thinking.

599
00:31:00,861 --> 00:31:02,662
- Were you here?
- Yes.

600
00:31:02,662 --> 00:31:04,264
- Did you hear anything?
- No.

601
00:31:04,264 --> 00:31:05,632
- Nothing?
- No.

602
00:31:05,632 --> 00:31:07,434
- What were you doing?
- Vic.

603
00:31:07,434 --> 00:31:09,036
I was working with Matthew.

604
00:31:10,537 --> 00:31:12,105
Let's go find her.

605
00:31:19,312 --> 00:31:21,648
What are you doing here?

606
00:31:21,648 --> 00:31:25,152
Aceveda called in extra units until
those killers are in custody.

607
00:31:29,956 --> 00:31:33,727
Hey, Julien. You think maybe
you came back too early?

608
00:31:34,594 --> 00:31:35,829
What?

609
00:31:35,829 --> 00:31:38,432
Maybe you should've stayed
on disability some more.

610
00:31:39,199 --> 00:31:41,068
Vanessa worries too much.

611
00:31:43,303 --> 00:31:46,673
Look, things are good for me now.
Better than they've ever been.

612
00:31:46,673 --> 00:31:48,942
Here. At home.

613
00:31:48,942 --> 00:31:50,444
I was at your home.

614
00:31:51,211 --> 00:31:54,147
Come on, Julien. You're not yourself.

615
00:31:54,147 --> 00:31:55,449
I am.

616
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:59,286
Yeah? Well, what happened
to Carlson then?

617
00:32:03,857 --> 00:32:05,358
He got hurt.

618
00:32:22,175 --> 00:32:23,643
Yo, Ronnie, that's them.

619
00:32:36,022 --> 00:32:37,224
Gun!

620
00:32:37,624 --> 00:32:38,959
Shit. He blew it.

621
00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:41,595
- Get out of the way!
- Everybody down!

622
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:46,466
We know she's your girlfriend.
Let her go.

623
00:32:46,466 --> 00:32:48,502
- I'll still kill her.
- Okay.

624
00:32:49,069 --> 00:32:51,671
You got a car, man. Just go. Go, man.

625
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,876
- Don't move.
- Get on your stomach.

626
00:32:55,876 --> 00:32:57,477
Hands up! Palms up!

627
00:32:57,477 --> 00:33:00,013
- Turn him around.
- I got him.

628
00:33:00,013 --> 00:33:02,616
Get your ass up. Let's go.

629
00:33:02,616 --> 00:33:04,518
Was she upset or something?

630
00:33:04,518 --> 00:33:07,621
I told her she couldn't go to
Piper's sleepover. She lost it.

631
00:33:07,621 --> 00:33:10,624
I told her we were gonna talk
about it after I got home.

632
00:33:10,624 --> 00:33:12,325
I thought you were
taking night shifts.

633
00:33:12,325 --> 00:33:13,660
This was OT.

634
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,629
And then this happens.

635
00:33:15,629 --> 00:33:18,532
Camilla was there and
Owen was with Matthew.

636
00:33:18,532 --> 00:33:21,601
I don't even know Owen. And...
And who the hell is Camilla?

637
00:33:21,601 --> 00:33:23,837
- Jesus Christ...
- We're getting a divorce.

638
00:33:23,837 --> 00:33:25,772
I need to work. This is not my fault.

639
00:33:25,772 --> 00:33:27,340
Whose is it, then?

640
00:33:27,607 --> 00:33:30,677
Vic, shut up. Just shut up.

641
00:33:32,913 --> 00:33:34,381
I didn't do it.

642
00:33:45,025 --> 00:33:47,294
- What is it?
- It's a...

643
00:33:49,429 --> 00:33:52,599
...quadrophenia report.

644
00:33:54,034 --> 00:33:57,504
<i>Positive traces of thallium
</i>were found in your kitchen.

645
00:33:57,938 --> 00:34:00,173
<i>I didn't have any
</i>thallium in my kitchen.

646
00:34:01,107 --> 00:34:03,376
Then how do you explain that?

647
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,523
Okay, what...? What happens now?

648
00:34:16,523 --> 00:34:19,326
<i>Dutch gets his name in the papers.</i>

649
00:34:19,326 --> 00:34:22,429
Egomaniac roped in a reporter
to do a story on him.

650
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:24,130
He's in the building.

651
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:25,865
So everybody'll know he busted me?

652
00:34:25,865 --> 00:34:28,802
He was assigned the case.
He gets credit.

653
00:34:29,936 --> 00:34:31,238
Well...

654
00:34:36,576 --> 00:34:38,278
What if I tell you what happened?

655
00:34:39,746 --> 00:34:42,849
I guess that I'd get the credit.

656
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:50,757
<i>Well, it's not like you think.</i>

657
00:34:54,494 --> 00:34:58,131
I mean, I knew I could never pay
Robert back all that money.

658
00:34:59,399 --> 00:35:01,234
And the thallium, it just...

659
00:35:01,234 --> 00:35:04,004
It just seemed easier than
disappointing him again.

660
00:35:08,842 --> 00:35:11,378
- There.
- Stop.

661
00:35:21,087 --> 00:35:23,523
Cass. Are you okay?

662
00:35:23,523 --> 00:35:24,624
Yep.

663
00:35:25,458 --> 00:35:26,626
Cass?

664
00:35:28,628 --> 00:35:30,263
All right, come on, let's go.

665
00:35:34,734 --> 00:35:36,136
Cassidy.

666
00:35:40,307 --> 00:35:41,675
Let's go.

667
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,311
Right now.

668
00:35:54,587 --> 00:35:56,856
I decided to partner you up again.

669
00:35:57,724 --> 00:36:00,493
I thought Tommy and l were
doing well together, sir.

670
00:36:00,493 --> 00:36:03,096
You two have a history.
This made more sense.

671
00:36:03,096 --> 00:36:04,631
Do you have a problem with this?

672
00:36:05,832 --> 00:36:07,667
Not if Julien doesn't.

673
00:36:08,835 --> 00:36:10,537
Trust me, this will work.

674
00:36:11,471 --> 00:36:13,406
You'll start riding
together tomorrow.

675
00:36:14,874 --> 00:36:16,142
Yes, sir.

676
00:36:23,216 --> 00:36:25,185
How's Cass, man?

677
00:36:25,185 --> 00:36:26,786
She's good.

678
00:36:26,786 --> 00:36:28,955
Looks like you guys did
just fine without me.

679
00:36:28,955 --> 00:36:30,457
- Yeah.
- That's right.

680
00:36:38,431 --> 00:36:39,999
Lookie what we got.

681
00:36:44,137 --> 00:36:46,373
Now you can get the
chief on the phone.

682
00:36:51,878 --> 00:36:53,580
The shooter's in custody?

683
00:36:54,047 --> 00:36:55,682
It's chilly in here.

684
00:36:55,682 --> 00:36:57,951
Somebody turn up the
air conditioning?

685
00:36:57,951 --> 00:37:00,253
- How'd you find them?
- By running my ass off.

686
00:37:00,253 --> 00:37:03,823
Wyms had us going over the stolen
car looking for nose hairs.

687
00:37:03,823 --> 00:37:07,694
So how about a preview?
Bikini or Brazilian?

688
00:37:18,805 --> 00:37:21,341
- Hey.
- Hey.

689
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:24,745
It's good stuff out there today.

690
00:37:24,745 --> 00:37:27,948
Avoided a shootout at the swap meet.
Could have got real ugly.

691
00:37:27,948 --> 00:37:29,950
- It was no biggie.
- Yes, it was.

692
00:37:30,917 --> 00:37:32,285
It was great work.

693
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,654
You don't have to go overboard.

694
00:37:34,654 --> 00:37:37,024
I do when I'm about to
ask someone a big favor.

695
00:37:41,194 --> 00:37:43,697
I need you to work it out with Shane.

696
00:37:43,697 --> 00:37:46,733
- Tell him.
- You could be the bigger man here.

697
00:37:46,733 --> 00:37:49,603
I dig what you do. And Shane...

698
00:37:49,603 --> 00:37:53,206
- He's a cracker with 'tude.
- He's acting out because you're good.

699
00:37:53,206 --> 00:37:55,475
Help me make him feel secure.

700
00:37:55,475 --> 00:37:58,912
- Send him to a shrink.
- I'm gonna talk to him too.

701
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:03,784
But I'm asking you, take one
for the team here. For me.

702
00:38:09,589 --> 00:38:11,158
Shit.

703
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:19,666
Babe, what are we doing?

704
00:38:26,473 --> 00:38:31,445
Maybe it's God's plan for
us just to have Randall.

705
00:38:31,445 --> 00:38:34,981
I want my own child too. With you.

706
00:38:34,981 --> 00:38:36,750
Randall is your child.

707
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:38,285
A man like Shane Vendrell...

708
00:38:38,285 --> 00:38:40,921
...can get his woman pregnant
without even trying.

709
00:38:42,622 --> 00:38:45,559
We're trying. We'll just...
We'll keep trying.

710
00:38:45,559 --> 00:38:47,060
You know what I mean.

711
00:38:48,195 --> 00:38:51,364
You're not comfortable. I don't
want another fight about this.

712
00:38:51,364 --> 00:38:53,467
No fight.

713
00:38:53,467 --> 00:38:56,470
I will go to the doctor and
I will see what I can do.

714
00:39:01,475 --> 00:39:03,577
Two cases in one day.
You're on a roll.

715
00:39:03,577 --> 00:39:05,745
You're the one who
solved the poisoning.

716
00:39:05,745 --> 00:39:07,581
I was just your pawn.

717
00:39:08,582 --> 00:39:11,251
That's one way of
looking at it, I guess.

718
00:39:11,251 --> 00:39:12,953
So, what's your story?

719
00:39:14,354 --> 00:39:16,456
You running your two teams...

720
00:39:16,456 --> 00:39:18,792
...or are you still a
measly detective with me?

721
00:39:18,792 --> 00:39:20,794
I'm whatever you need me to be.

722
00:39:20,794 --> 00:39:22,762
And what if I need
you to complete me?

723
00:39:24,431 --> 00:39:26,133
Please don't say that.

724
00:39:31,671 --> 00:39:33,073
Hey.

725
00:39:33,073 --> 00:39:34,374
Hey.

726
00:39:34,374 --> 00:39:36,209
What's going on?

727
00:39:36,209 --> 00:39:38,712
A baby, man. Congratulations.

728
00:39:38,712 --> 00:39:40,113
I can't feel anything.

729
00:39:40,113 --> 00:39:41,748
Looks like you're feeling something.

730
00:39:43,383 --> 00:39:47,053
Look, man, I was
hoping we could talk.

731
00:39:47,053 --> 00:39:48,355
Yeah, what about?

732
00:39:50,824 --> 00:39:53,527
Figured we could work some shit out.

733
00:39:53,527 --> 00:39:54,995
How you feeling?

734
00:39:55,962 --> 00:39:58,732
As long as I have ginger ale
and crackers, I'm fine.

735
00:39:58,732 --> 00:40:00,300
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

736
00:40:02,536 --> 00:40:03,837
So you want anything?

737
00:40:04,838 --> 00:40:06,373
Just to clear the air.

738
00:40:08,608 --> 00:40:11,111
I'm gonna go check on the laundry.

739
00:40:14,381 --> 00:40:15,549
Bye.

740
00:40:16,016 --> 00:40:17,717
- Okay.
- Okay.

741
00:40:29,963 --> 00:40:34,134
All right, look. The Strike
Team, that's your gig, okay?

742
00:40:34,134 --> 00:40:37,871
You and Vic, you established
it, everyone knows that.

743
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:42,175
I just wanna add what
I can to the mix.

744
00:40:42,175 --> 00:40:43,577
I appreciate that.

745
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:46,513
But I don't wanna be along for
the ride if I'm not wanted.

746
00:40:48,448 --> 00:40:50,050
I wasn't trying to be a dick.

747
00:40:50,884 --> 00:40:53,086
Me and Vic built this thing...

748
00:40:53,086 --> 00:40:55,422
...and I don't want somebody
coming in and screwing it up.

749
00:40:58,458 --> 00:40:59,693
I won't.

750
00:41:02,262 --> 00:41:04,331
You coming here and
apologizing, I get that.

751
00:41:05,832 --> 00:41:08,535
As long as you know your
place, we'll be all right.

752
00:41:08,535 --> 00:41:09,703
My place?

753
00:41:09,703 --> 00:41:11,638
What, like back of the bus?

754
00:41:14,341 --> 00:41:16,243
What, you think you're
driving the bus?

755
00:41:16,243 --> 00:41:18,979
You know what? He doesn't
wanna hurt your feelings...

756
00:41:18,979 --> 00:41:20,747
...but Vic has plans for me.

757
00:41:20,747 --> 00:41:22,282
He's my best friend.

758
00:41:22,282 --> 00:41:24,351
He's been my best
friend for seven years.

759
00:41:24,351 --> 00:41:26,987
You think he's gonna push
me aside for some darkie?

760
00:42:15,268 --> 00:42:16,436
Get off!

761
00:42:18,004 --> 00:42:19,072
Stop it!

762
00:42:47,233 --> 00:42:48,935
- Where you going?
- No.

763
00:42:48,935 --> 00:42:50,904
- No!
- Where you going?

764
00:42:50,904 --> 00:42:52,405
- Come here.
- No!

765
00:42:52,405 --> 00:42:54,074
- Come here! Come here!
- Stop!

766
00:42:54,074 --> 00:42:57,644
Let go of me! Let go of me!
Let go of me!

767
00:42:57,644 --> 00:42:59,079
- No.
- Let go of me!

768
00:42:59,879 --> 00:43:01,214
Please.

769
00:43:01,214 --> 00:43:02,449
My God.

770
00:43:14,227 --> 00:43:17,030
I wanted you to know. That
little problem before?

771
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:19,432
- All taken care of.
- Good.

772
00:43:19,966 --> 00:43:21,768
My guys did good today.

773
00:43:22,635 --> 00:43:25,338
Just as long as they
keep their clothes on.

774
00:43:25,338 --> 00:43:27,073
You heard about that?

775
00:43:28,241 --> 00:43:31,378
Little wager. Good
incentive for a great job.

776
00:43:31,378 --> 00:43:33,246
Lucky you didn't lose.

777
00:43:33,246 --> 00:43:37,250
- I wasn't worried.
- No, lucky for us you didn't lose.

778
00:44:08,648 --> 00:44:10,950
Call 911, man. Somebody.

779
00:44:15,455 --> 00:44:17,590
Gentlemen, this way, please.

780
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:19,125
Let's go. Keep moving.

781
00:44:21,995 --> 00:44:24,697
Cage is clear. Give them
the two-minute warning.

782
00:44:27,534 --> 00:44:30,303
- Hello?
- I spoke to Cassidy's teacher.

783
00:44:30,737 --> 00:44:34,107
You know, the usual "this is normal
in a divorce" kind of stuff.

784
00:44:34,107 --> 00:44:37,043
- Well, what do we do now?
- We all need to sit down together...

785
00:44:37,043 --> 00:44:41,181
- ...and work it out with a counselor.
<i>- Listen.</i>

786
00:44:41,481 --> 00:44:42,849
This wasn't your fault.

787
00:44:44,184 --> 00:44:45,452
<i>I was just...</i>

788
00:44:46,386 --> 00:44:47,787
I was out of my mind.

789
00:44:48,688 --> 00:44:51,124
- I know.
- Okay.

790
00:44:52,158 --> 00:44:53,560
I'm just glad she's home.

791
00:44:54,561 --> 00:44:56,629
- Me too.
<i>- Okay.</i>

792
00:45:14,948 --> 00:45:16,182
God.

793
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:40,807
I cannot believe that Shane
and Tavon just missed that.
