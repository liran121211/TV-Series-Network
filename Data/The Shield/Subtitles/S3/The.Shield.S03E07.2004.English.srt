1
00:00:00,767 --> 00:00:02,702
<i>Previously on "The Shield".</i>

2
00:00:02,702 --> 00:00:05,638
Hey, Vic, wait a minute. I
just got my job back, okay?

3
00:00:05,638 --> 00:00:07,107
I'm not breaking into this place.

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,342
I'm not taking another fall.

5
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:11,745
You guys go back out there,
I gotta go to Aceveda.

6
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:13,947
- Let's go.
- You went off the grid today?

7
00:00:13,947 --> 00:00:16,816
- Who told you that?
- Today was a one-time thing. Got it?

8
00:00:16,816 --> 00:00:18,451
- Got it?
- Got it.

9
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:19,886
On your knees, man.

10
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,922
Let's see that mouth. Suck it!

11
00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:29,329
- She's been crying for you.
- It's been really busy right now.

12
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:31,064
You're always busy.

13
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:32,999
That's never stopped you
from coming home before.

14
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:35,535
These are the serial
numbers of the bills.

15
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:36,903
They'll get flagged.

16
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:39,806
We can't spend a nickel until
we know which bills are marked.

17
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:42,842
Treasury's got Aceveda checking
bills on any bust over a grand.

18
00:00:42,842 --> 00:00:44,778
- List's in Aceveda's safe.
- Well, so that's it.

19
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:46,679
- Not necessarily.
- It's in a safe...

20
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:49,816
...in a captain's office,
inside of a police station.

21
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:51,217
Gotta be a way.

22
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:55,155
It's freezing out here.

23
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:57,824
Decoy Squad's in the clubhouse.
We're working late...

24
00:00:57,824 --> 00:01:00,026
...tomorrow night, boys. You
got plans, change them.

25
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:01,394
I got tickets for Journey.

26
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:02,595
What's going on?

27
00:01:02,595 --> 00:01:04,764
Getting the list out
of Aceveda's safe.

28
00:01:04,764 --> 00:01:07,867
- What? I thought there was no way.
- All things change.

29
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:10,503
- The president's in town campaigning.
- In Farmington?

30
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:12,972
His schedule changed. Added
a stop in Century City.

31
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:15,475
Takes him right through our
shitty neck of the woods...

32
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:17,744
...at about 65 miles an hour.

33
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,412
What's that got to do with the list?

34
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,614
Every cop is stuck
on security detail.

35
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:24,451
Means a skeleton crew in the
Barn all day and night.

36
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:26,186
You forgetting about the combination?

37
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:28,154
Aceveda's safe is county-issue.

38
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:29,956
Means the combination's on file.

39
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:32,959
Anybody from Property ever
asks you for a favor, do it.

40
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:35,595
We get one shot. After the
president's gone, that's it.

41
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:38,765
This works, I might even
have to vote for the guy.

42
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:45,104
All right.

43
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:49,509
- I'm going.
- It's 6:00 in the morning.

44
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:51,711
Come on, you gotta stop that.

45
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:53,780
It's just one, to start the day.

46
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,149
To go with the other eight butts?

47
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:59,519
Six of them are yours.
Maybe you should stop too.

48
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,988
All right, that's just
the hormones talking.

49
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,525
My mom knows about the baby.

50
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,661
Jenny opened her big
mouth to my aunt.

51
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:12,098
Okay, so now she knows.

52
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:15,902
- God, she's gonna milk this one.
- Come on, she can't be that bad.

53
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:17,237
Yeah?

54
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:20,807
I'm the only one that talks to her,
so that means I get all her crap.

55
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:24,177
Look, don't worry
about your mom, okay?

56
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:29,015
- You're supposed to be off today.
- Well, now I'm on.

57
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:31,184
The president's in town.

58
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:33,620
Bye.

59
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,531
Okay, it's a half an hour before
morning shift is back on duty.

60
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:46,232
It's a ghost town out there.

61
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,325
Okay.

62
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:14,327
All right.

63
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:25,838
Clear. Four, eight, five, two, one.

64
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:30,376
Shit.

65
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,412
Shit.

66
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:34,447
She's here. Nina's here.

67
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:37,016
Get down, get down.

68
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,356
- Hey, you're here early.
- So are you.

69
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:45,658
Gotta beat the bad guy to the punch.

70
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:09,882
Where's the list?

71
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:12,719
Ask your Property guy when he
pulls his head out of his ass.

72
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,087
Christ.

73
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,959
- Sure you punched in the code right?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

74
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:23,062
- We gotta figure out another way.
- There is no other way.

75
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:27,834
Especially when employee of the
month clocks in two hours early.

76
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:31,437
I might be able to crack the
safe, if I had enough time.

77
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,906
- You ever tried that?
- Never stopped me before.

78
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:37,043
Look, Shane was in there 30
seconds, we almost got caught.

79
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,950
If we could get the safe
out sometime tonight...

80
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,451
...Ronnie can take his sweet time.

81
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:48,021
How's Aceveda not gonna
notice a missing safe?

82
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:50,256
He'll be gone.

83
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:52,358
Plus, we'll put in a twin.

84
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:56,462
That safe is standard police-issue.
Gotta be a thousand of them around.

85
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,830
I have to see the detective.

86
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,465
Your girlfriend's back.

87
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:04,237
Christ. This I don't need right now.

88
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:09,709
- Detective.
- Mrs. Maldonado.

89
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:12,779
Reina's friend gave me this song.

90
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:17,450
It says he killed her. It says
he stabbed and killed mi hija.

91
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:23,423
This is supposed to be hip?

92
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:26,359
It sounds like a Chihuahua
threw up on an accordion.

93
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:29,862
It's a narcocorrido.
A song about crimes.

94
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:33,433
-Very popular in Mexico.
-Making their way up north.

95
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:37,403
Chaydez loved her, but
he couldn't have her.

96
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:39,372
Couldn't let her go.
It's a love song.

97
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:42,875
Not quite.

98
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:47,113
As they made love, he stabbed her once
for every day they were together.

99
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:51,951
And buried her by the underpass
in Frogtown Flats by the river.

100
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:54,854
- A real chart-topper.
- Who's this victim, Reina?

101
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:59,559
Fifteen-year-old girl,
disappeared six months ago.

102
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:02,929
It was Bobby's case. I helped out
for a day checking gang angles.

103
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:06,099
- And?
- Wasn't gang.

104
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:07,934
Chaydez worked for her father.

105
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:10,803
He was the only suspect. I
guess nothing ever came of it.

106
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:13,039
Ever since Bobby took
early retirement...

107
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,208
...Mom's been coming
to me for updates.

108
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,843
Do we know the singer?

109
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:21,714
Otilio Ramirez. Self-published. The
cowboy crap is straight ranchero.

110
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:22,949
Let's see if we can locate him.

111
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:25,451
Also get a canine unit
and look for the body.

112
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:26,853
Why?

113
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:29,689
Because the song says
she's buried there.

114
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:32,692
We gonna bring in Eminem every
time he raps about killing his ex?

115
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:37,063
Rap songs are fantasies.
Narcocorridos are recorded history.

116
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,865
Learn something new every day.

117
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:45,271
If we're looking for a
body, it must be Lauren.

118
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:47,240
Hey.

119
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,042
Careful. Boris doesn't
play well with other dogs.

120
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:52,044
I must have the magic touch.

121
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:53,913
Give him time to know you better.

122
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,548
Heel.

123
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:56,783
Sit.

124
00:06:57,617 --> 00:07:00,686
So, what brings us
together this time?

125
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:04,157
Heard a song about a lovesick cholo
buried his chiquita out here.

126
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:06,192
They brought us out
because of a song?

127
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:08,661
Look at it as quality time.

128
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:11,230
-You still got that boyfriend?
-Still got that wife?

129
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,633
No. Still got that boyfriend?

130
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,503
The cook, right?

131
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,771
Chef.

132
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:23,643
- Find.
- How's that going?

133
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:26,512
He's trying to establish his career.

134
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:28,381
Been a while.

135
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:30,149
Still don't see a ring.

136
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,419
Don't worry, he'll get to it.

137
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:38,090
Body.

138
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,762
They don't write love
songs like they used to.

139
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:50,069
Body.

140
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:58,344
Body.

141
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:03,983
I need more flags.

142
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:35,582
- Hey, can I get your autograph?
- Yeah, like on a confession.

143
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:37,517
- Pack up.
- Who are you?

144
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,352
- We're big fans.
- The biggest.

145
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,820
What are you doing?

146
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:43,189
Let's go.

147
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:47,360
What are you doing?

148
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,995
- He didn't do nothing.
- Yeah?

149
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:51,698
He seems to know where the
bodies are buried. Don't you?

150
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:54,501
- You can't silence me.
- No, we're gonna make you talk.

151
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:56,803
Just get your wiry ass in the car.

152
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:04,311
- Look, I know all my rights.
- Relax.

153
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:07,547
- You might get a new album out of it.
-I s that our corridor?

154
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,049
Yeah.

155
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,850
Not as tough as he sings.

156
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,485
They pulled eight bodies out.

157
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:15,822
All young women in various
stages of decomposition.

158
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:17,257
Eight?

159
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:19,359
Well, any of them stabbed?

160
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,595
Some were there too long to tell.
We'll wait for the ME.

161
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:25,665
So these guys actually write
songs celebrating crimes?

162
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:27,534
The popular ones get commissioned.

163
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:29,569
- Musical confessions?
- I'm gonna go see...

164
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,605
...what they recovered from
the dead women's bodies.

165
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:35,709
- Gonna start with Otilio?
- I'll make him sing.

166
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:38,678
Your song says that Reina
Maldonado was stabbed to death...

167
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:42,115
...and dumped by the railroad tracks.
That sound familiar?

168
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:43,917
My songs speak for themselves.

169
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,386
I'd rather hear it
from you, rock star.

170
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:50,190
She was 14 years old
when she went missing.

171
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:53,293
You sing about Chaydez stabbing her.

172
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:56,262
- What are you doing?
- Trying to find out why your CD...

173
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:59,232
- ...led us to eight dead women.
- Help!

174
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:02,936
- Help! You stay away from me.
- Jesus Christ. What's your problem?

175
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:06,639
- Help!
- What's going on?

176
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,641
Nothing.

177
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:10,577
- Really.
- I don't wanna be alone with him.

178
00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:12,746
I didn't touch him.
Go look at the tape.

179
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:13,980
I'll just sit in.

180
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,117
- That's not necessary.
- Everyone's on presidential detail.

181
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,352
I can lend a hand.

182
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:20,754
Now, where were we?

183
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:29,028
I don't commit crimes.
I'm a journalist.

184
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:30,964
Is that what you think you are?

185
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:34,200
Did Chaydez commission that song?

186
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:38,805
- A reporter protects his sources.
- Reporters don't protect killers.

187
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,240
I just write the truth.

188
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,809
Arrest me, arrest the L.A. Times too.

189
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:48,381
Sol Negro needed money
for his family.

190
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,850
Planned to take it from a
liquor store on San Marcos...

191
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:54,053
...but the shop owner hated Mexicans.

192
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:55,388
Pulled a gun.

193
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:57,991
- Sol Negro shot him in the neck.
- I remember that.

194
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,627
- You remember that?
- I sure do, it was Christmas.

195
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:03,396
Yeah. It can't be this easy, can it?

196
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:07,133
Otilio's got three CDs. Who knows
how many cases we might close?

197
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:09,669
Run Sol Negro, see what
street name comes up.

198
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,272
Show the mug shot to the victim.

199
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:14,574
Who am l, the Strike
Team all of a sudden?

200
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:16,443
- What?
- That sounded like an order.

201
00:11:16,443 --> 00:11:18,211
It's not.

202
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:20,513
- How do you wanna go?
- Same way.

203
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,882
It's just, it's nice to be asked.

204
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:32,425
- Are you arresting Chaydez?
- He's just here for questioning.

205
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:35,261
- Does he know where Reina is?
- If he knows, I'll know.

206
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:40,667
Listen, this could take a while.
So why don't you go home...

207
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:42,836
- ...get a rest?
- I want to stay here.

208
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:44,637
For the good news.

209
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:51,177
Hear that, Chaydez?
He's singing about you.

210
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:53,847
Just a song.

211
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:58,518
No, it's a map to eight dead girls.
And I got a big bet...

212
00:11:58,518 --> 00:12:00,887
- ...Reina Maldonado is one of them.
- Wrong.

213
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:03,056
I don't understand why
an asshole like you...

214
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,657
...would put a stabbing to music.

215
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:06,426
- I didn't write that.
- No.

216
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:08,862
You killed Reina and had
Otilio write it for you.

217
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:12,131
- Never happened.
- Narcocorridos are real. Not made up.

218
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:14,601
The singer's reputation
depends on it.

219
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:17,370
Now, he sung about a dead body.
We found eight.

220
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:23,076
You were off my radar,
now you're back.

221
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,645
- Can I see you two outside?
- Later.

222
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:27,080
Now, I think.

223
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:31,918
We heard from the lab.
Early best guess says...

224
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:35,889
...the deaths look like poisoning from
long-term chemical-meth exposure.

225
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:38,291
Reina hooked up with an
asshole cooking crank?

226
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:41,094
Maybe not. Her dental
records are on file.

227
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,897
She wasn't there. She wasn't
one of the bodies we pulled.

228
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:47,233
Maybe there's another burial ground.

229
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:50,203
So we have a meth operation
that's poisoning its workers...

230
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:51,704
...and a missing girl.

231
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:56,976
Claudette, run the meth thing with
Dutch. Vic, you stay with Reina.

232
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:59,946
- The singer and his muse?
- Keep until we find out more.

233
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,481
How? We're at deadline.

234
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:04,484
- We got nothing to charge them with.
- Find something.

235
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:08,121
Secret Service wants to
meet with the captains.

236
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,689
I'll be back in about an hour.

237
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:15,795
What did he tell me to do?
Drum up charges to hold them?

238
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,498
Trust me, that doesn't work.

239
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:20,099
He didn't mean it, right?

240
00:13:22,702 --> 00:13:28,007
I could free up part of the
Decoy Squad for a few hours.

241
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:30,009
Cut Chaydez loose,
keep a tail on him.

242
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:32,812
- That's your call, not mine.
- I'll take responsibility.

243
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:36,215
When Walon's team comes
into the Barn, cut him.

244
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:56,202
Get it inside the clubhouse. Aceveda's
out of the office for an hour.

245
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:59,405
Decoy Squad's on the way in. Just
enough time to make the switch.

246
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:02,375
- I really don't like this.
- Well, you'll pretend.

247
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:06,980
What's with all the Rolaids, man?

248
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,849
- I got an ulcer.
- Since when?

249
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,552
Since the Armenian mob
started looking for me.

250
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:14,687
- This helps.
- Stop worrying your guts out.

251
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,022
We're not gonna get busted.

252
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,491
Why are we breaking into
a captain's office?

253
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:21,394
We can nail 20 guys
we lay the cash on...

254
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:24,097
...get 30 cents on the dollar.
Let them worry about washing it.

255
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:27,934
Partner up with criminals? Trying
to find the flaw in that plan.

256
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:29,469
There's other ways...

257
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:31,504
That are fine if you
want huge risk...

258
00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:35,508
...and 30 cents on the dollar, but
I want a dollar on the dollar.

259
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,482
Hey.

260
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,384
Somebody moving?

261
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,686
Yeah, we're just moving
a little stuff...

262
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:49,188
...out of the clubhouse. Make
some room for your team.

263
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:51,224
I thought you wanted us out.

264
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:54,260
I do. Might as well be all
comfortable in the meantime.

265
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,929
Listen, I heard you guys
came by to help us out.

266
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:58,898
It beats going home to an empty bed.

267
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,100
I can't help you with that tonight.

268
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,337
Don't worry, I haven't
needed a slumpbuster yet.

269
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:10,643
Hey, what happened with
the Secret Service?

270
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:12,445
Got postponed.

271
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:15,348
Thank you for the help
with the Maldonado case.

272
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:19,352
I was glad when you
came in when you did.

273
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:22,889
Listen, I just about wrote
this girl off for dead.

274
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:25,658
I poked my head into it
for a little while...

275
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:28,828
...but when we hit the
wall, I just checked out.

276
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:31,698
- Then make it right.
- You're not hearing me.

277
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:40,773
Reina's father died a month
ago from a heart attack.

278
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:44,544
He just couldn't stand his
daughter missing and not knowing.

279
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:51,384
I was just hoping to get the mom
some good news, that's all.

280
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:53,086
Well, just keep trying.

281
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,939
- How's your stomach?
- Better when this is done.

282
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:15,441
- We're halfway home.
- All right.

283
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:16,709
Let's go.

284
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:22,081
All right, you're on. You
gotta get inside the safe...

285
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:24,751
...make a copy of the list
before day shift comes back on.

286
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:26,619
Glad there's no pressure.

287
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:28,421
Lend him a Rolaids.

288
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:33,392
- Three-hole punch?
- Yeah, 3973.

289
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,962
- Tape dispensers?
- I got five units.

290
00:16:35,962 --> 00:16:38,231
Right. Stapler?

291
00:16:39,766 --> 00:16:41,901
Six.

292
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:44,804
Great, only 57 more to find.

293
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:48,074
And then we'll see what
our next punishment is.

294
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:51,811
Look, I told you that I was
gonna go out to Aceveda...

295
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:54,981
- ...and you still went out there.
- It was the right thing to do.

296
00:16:54,981 --> 00:16:57,817
Maybe, but you could have
also gotten hung out to dry.

297
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:00,620
It was the right thing.

298
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,694
I had to make a deal with
Aceveda to get my job back.

299
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,264
Tell him if I saw any
cops going out of line.

300
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:15,802
When I made that promise,
I sure didn't think...

301
00:17:15,802 --> 00:17:17,303
...that you'd be one of them.

302
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,741
One-inch binders?

303
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:25,211
Got it.

304
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:29,949
Liquor-store owner just ID'd Sol
Negro, a.k.a. Julio Gallegos...

305
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:33,152
...as our shooter in
that Christmas robbery.

306
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:35,822
If we close any more cases
because of Otilio's songs...

307
00:17:35,822 --> 00:17:37,423
...we should deputize him.

308
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:40,459
Maybe I can get him to write a
tune about my cuddler rapist.

309
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,228
- You coming?
- Can't.

310
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,931
One dead woman had a friend's
number in her pocket.

311
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:46,465
She should be here any minute.

312
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:56,742
That's Leticia.

313
00:17:57,543 --> 00:18:00,012
She was my best friend in Mexico.

314
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:03,149
Her body was found along
with seven others...

315
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:06,452
...all showing signs of
long-term chemical exposure.

316
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:08,254
What kind of chemical?

317
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,389
The kind they use to
make methamphetamines.

318
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:13,292
She would have had to breathe an
awful lot to die of exposure.

319
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:16,562
She never touched drugs.

320
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:19,665
- When did she come to L.A.?
- I don't know.

321
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:22,101
She saved up for a coyote
to bring her up...

322
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,503
...but I never saw her.

323
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:27,406
She called me two weeks ago,
but I only got a message.

324
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:29,442
Saying what?

325
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,911
That she needed help.

326
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:33,946
But then it hung up.

327
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,249
And you didn't report her missing?

328
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:39,051
To who? To say what?

329
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:42,688
That she was being smuggled over
the border and needed help?

330
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:49,328
Sol Negro. Spelled
just like it sounds.

331
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,231
- Any problems?
- Piece of cake.

332
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:53,899
Gonna jump back on the cuddler case.

333
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:57,737
I need some help. Hit a wall
ID'ing some of the other bodies.

334
00:18:57,737 --> 00:19:01,407
So, what, we're just gonna drop all
of our other cases, is that it?

335
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:03,743
Eight dead women doesn't
fire your engine?

336
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:07,046
I don't wanna lose momentum on
the rape case. I can't do both.

337
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:11,851
- Fine, just give me a second.
- Thanks.

338
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:22,628
- Otilio. Otilio!
- Buzz me, buzz me.

339
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,522
You guys all right?

340
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:52,625
Get him to the ER, make
sure they take an x-ray.

341
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:56,162
- What was that guy saying?
- There's your next song.

342
00:20:12,912 --> 00:20:14,647
Tell me I'm rich again.

343
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:16,148
I can't crack it.

344
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:20,653
Well, can you pull the lock out?

345
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:24,256
- Not so you wouldn't notice.
- This keeps getting better.

346
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:27,693
How do we get the safe back
inside with Aceveda still here?

347
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:29,829
Let's worry about the list first.

348
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:34,567
Got one window, and in about three
hours it's gonna slam shut.

349
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:37,203
We'll each take turns
tracking Aceveda's movements.

350
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:39,305
- Smitty could get in the safe.
- No.

351
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:43,843
Wanna keep this in-house
until we absolutely have to.

352
00:20:57,724 --> 00:20:58,958
Shit.

353
00:21:00,493 --> 00:21:01,795
Shit.

354
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:08,835
- I'm really busy, Mara.
- Guess who I was on the phone with.

355
00:21:08,835 --> 00:21:11,805
- Can we talk about this later?
<i>- She calls me in a panic.</i>

356
00:21:11,805 --> 00:21:13,873
<i>It's always the same old shit.</i>

357
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:16,876
Mom says that they're gonna kick
her out of her apartment...

358
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:20,747
...if I can't help her with the rent.
I haven't sold a single house yet.

359
00:21:20,747 --> 00:21:22,549
We'll talk about it
later, okay, baby?

360
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:25,552
<i>Later when?
</i>Are you ever coming home?

361
00:21:25,552 --> 00:21:26,920
I really need you.

362
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,589
I'll be back as soon as I can, okay?

363
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:37,297
Hey, Dutch, we have to
do the annual inventory.

364
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:38,865
- Lucky you.
- Yeah.

365
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:41,735
Listen, did you check out a
departmental laptop computer...

366
00:21:41,735 --> 00:21:44,170
- ...about 10 months ago?
- No.

367
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:47,407
According to this, you did.
A Dell 5100.

368
00:21:47,407 --> 00:21:48,875
Whatever you're looking
at, it's wrong.

369
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,510
Is that your signature?

370
00:21:52,612 --> 00:21:54,047
Yeah.

371
00:21:54,047 --> 00:21:56,383
Good work out there today.

372
00:21:56,383 --> 00:21:58,184
Thank Boris.

373
00:21:58,184 --> 00:22:01,454
Yeah, I saw him out there.
Seemed a little restless.

374
00:22:01,454 --> 00:22:04,391
He's frustrated. He's worked
up and wants to go all night.

375
00:22:04,391 --> 00:22:06,226
Corpus interruptus.

376
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:10,730
One of these days we're gonna
meet under better circumstances.

377
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:12,165
Why leave it to chance?

378
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:14,167
Why isn't the
narcocorrido in the cage?

379
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:17,904
I don't know. I could check
the logbook if you want.

380
00:22:17,904 --> 00:22:19,973
Then you go get it.

381
00:22:19,973 --> 00:22:21,508
I gotta get Koto.

382
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:23,243
Narcotics called, said
that they wanted him to...

383
00:22:23,243 --> 00:22:25,078
...sniff out an after-hours club.

384
00:22:25,712 --> 00:22:29,282
- Good luck.
- Okay, see you.

385
00:22:29,282 --> 00:22:31,451
Where's Chaydez and the singer?

386
00:22:31,451 --> 00:22:33,219
We had to cut them loose.

387
00:22:35,321 --> 00:22:36,923
Christ.

388
00:22:37,891 --> 00:22:39,926
Cut them loose after I
told her to keep them?

389
00:22:39,926 --> 00:22:41,928
His hold time was over.
Had no choice.

390
00:22:41,928 --> 00:22:45,365
You think you can disobey
a direct goddamn order?

391
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:47,333
He didn't.

392
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:48,835
I did.

393
00:22:49,636 --> 00:22:51,271
You?

394
00:22:51,271 --> 00:22:52,939
We have to protect the case.

395
00:22:52,939 --> 00:22:54,274
I don't think you
realize how long we...

396
00:22:54,274 --> 00:22:56,843
I realize that I am
still captain here.

397
00:22:57,677 --> 00:23:00,914
And I will not put up with
shit like this again.

398
00:23:11,658 --> 00:23:14,260
Hey, did you find that computer yet?

399
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,396
- No, not yet. Did you?
- No.

400
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:18,665
If you don't locate it,
city's gonna bill you.

401
00:23:18,665 --> 00:23:20,400
Yeah.

402
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,203
I did remember what
I was using it for.

403
00:23:23,203 --> 00:23:25,505
- What?
- Child porn.

404
00:23:28,107 --> 00:23:31,578
I had some downtime, so I was
going into local chat rooms...

405
00:23:31,578 --> 00:23:34,948
...websites, see if anybody was
peddling smut or trying to lure kids.

406
00:23:34,948 --> 00:23:38,551
And I got drawn into something
else, forgot about it.

407
00:23:38,551 --> 00:23:42,355
So when we find this computer that
was last signed out by you...

408
00:23:42,355 --> 00:23:44,991
...it's gonna be loaded
up with kiddie porn?

409
00:23:44,991 --> 00:23:48,294
Yeah, I would appreciate a
chance to delete any files...

410
00:23:48,294 --> 00:23:50,296
...before anybody gets a look.

411
00:23:53,867 --> 00:23:56,436
I swear it was just work.

412
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,409
Nina, my guys need some new
things for the clubhouse.

413
00:24:03,409 --> 00:24:05,745
Could you cut through some red tape?

414
00:24:05,745 --> 00:24:08,982
You have to submit a request
to each department.

415
00:24:08,982 --> 00:24:12,051
Everybody knows you need
something done, come to you.

416
00:24:12,051 --> 00:24:15,054
I've got my own emergency
to deal with right now.

417
00:24:15,054 --> 00:24:16,756
Maybe I can help.

418
00:24:16,756 --> 00:24:18,958
Not unless you're a
licensed locksmith.

419
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:21,828
Locksmith? Smitty's your guy.

420
00:24:21,828 --> 00:24:25,265
I have one. Thanks, thank you.

421
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:31,337
Hector Moreno? Please.
Try Pelican Bay.

422
00:24:32,205 --> 00:24:35,441
He got sent up on a
burglary eight months ago.

423
00:24:35,441 --> 00:24:37,944
We've used Smitty before.

424
00:24:37,944 --> 00:24:40,847
But, hey, you know what you're doing.
I'm sorry.

425
00:24:43,416 --> 00:24:45,652
Is this Smitty person nearby?

426
00:24:51,624 --> 00:24:53,660
Why are we meeting in
the back of a van?

427
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,095
We need a little help
getting into a safe.

428
00:24:57,463 --> 00:25:01,634
Listen, guys, I'm kind of turning over
a new leaf, you know what I mean?

429
00:25:01,634 --> 00:25:04,337
- Yeah, it's about time.
- Sounds like a good idea.

430
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:07,373
I gotta be kind of selective
about the jobs I take.

431
00:25:07,373 --> 00:25:11,210
- I'm gearing up a new business now.
- Home security, right?

432
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,479
Hit a little start-up gift for you.

433
00:25:15,915 --> 00:25:18,718
Home burglaries in Farmington
over the last two months...

434
00:25:18,718 --> 00:25:20,787
...plus addresses and phone numbers.

435
00:25:20,787 --> 00:25:23,856
You say hello to 150 sure things.

436
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:30,330
First things first.

437
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:37,136
I'm gonna need the combination.

438
00:25:50,783 --> 00:25:53,886
- This could take a while.
- Just get it open.

439
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:07,066
Let me know when you get in.

440
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:22,749
- Yeah.
- Five, nine, five.

441
00:26:22,749 --> 00:26:25,051
Five, four, six.

442
00:26:26,552 --> 00:26:29,722
All right, make a copy of the
list, get it back here quick.

443
00:26:31,224 --> 00:26:32,825
Aceveda's got other stuff here.

444
00:26:32,825 --> 00:26:36,562
Forget them, just get the list.
Come on, come on, come on.

445
00:26:36,562 --> 00:26:39,332
- Got it.
- Go. Go, baby, go.

446
00:26:42,335 --> 00:26:43,536
Came from the bank.

447
00:26:43,536 --> 00:26:45,972
Chaydez cleaned out his
account when the bank opened.

448
00:26:45,972 --> 00:26:48,608
- Who's on him now?
- Walon. Chaydez had an account...

449
00:26:48,608 --> 00:26:51,944
...in two names. The teller
ID'd the Maldonado girl.

450
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:55,515
- Reina? When did she see her?
- About a week ago.

451
00:26:55,515 --> 00:26:59,352
She's alive? The teller's
sure it was the same girl?

452
00:26:59,352 --> 00:27:01,621
She remembers because they
seemed like an odd couple.

453
00:27:01,621 --> 00:27:04,891
She seemed too old to be his daughter
and too young to be his girlfriend.

454
00:27:06,025 --> 00:27:08,394
Reina was seen a week ago.

455
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:14,200
I knew it. I knew she was alive.

456
00:27:15,101 --> 00:27:17,770
How well did she and
Chaydez know each other?

457
00:27:21,407 --> 00:27:23,076
Not well.

458
00:27:25,344 --> 00:27:28,481
Chaydez worked for my husband.

459
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:30,049
Tiling.

460
00:27:31,918 --> 00:27:35,988
I knew he was hanging
around her too much.

461
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:37,957
Could they have been
closer than you think?

462
00:27:37,957 --> 00:27:40,259
No.

463
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:43,830
- Her papa would have killed her.
- What if Reina kept it a secret?

464
00:27:45,264 --> 00:27:47,433
She was 14.

465
00:27:47,433 --> 00:27:50,503
She don't keep a secret
like that from me.

466
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:52,505
No.

467
00:27:54,941 --> 00:27:57,643
<i>No, wait. Hang on, he's coming back.</i>

468
00:27:57,643 --> 00:28:00,046
- Activity at Chaydez's house.
- What kind?

469
00:28:00,046 --> 00:28:02,715
- Where is he now?
- In and out of his garage.

470
00:28:02,715 --> 00:28:04,717
He's unloading something
out of his van.

471
00:28:04,717 --> 00:28:08,054
- What's he taking out?
- Boxes and a bunch of bags.

472
00:28:08,054 --> 00:28:11,991
Something that looks
like wire or rope.

473
00:28:11,991 --> 00:28:14,660
<i>- He's ready to move something.
</i>- No sign of the girl?

474
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,195
<i>- Nothing.
</i>- Stay on him.

475
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:19,665
What if she's the thing being moved?
Any way to see inside?

476
00:28:19,665 --> 00:28:21,734
The shades are drawn.

477
00:28:21,734 --> 00:28:23,369
What about the back?

478
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:25,404
- Same thing.
- Same thing.

479
00:28:26,572 --> 00:28:28,875
- Go in.
<i>- What?</i>

480
00:28:29,842 --> 00:28:32,578
He could be prepping
to kill her right now.

481
00:28:32,578 --> 00:28:36,249
If he's got her stashed someplace
else, we might never find her.

482
00:28:36,249 --> 00:28:39,385
And any evidence we find
might be thrown out.

483
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:41,821
<i>We can give him a few more minutes.</i>

484
00:28:41,821 --> 00:28:43,923
I said, go in, get the girl.

485
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,032
No sign of her?

486
00:28:53,032 --> 00:28:55,835
Some clothes, shoes. She was
there for a while at some point.

487
00:28:55,835 --> 00:28:57,170
Any proof she's still alive?

488
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:59,939
Found a receipt for some
makeup bought three days ago.

489
00:28:59,939 --> 00:29:01,874
It's not admissible. Nothing will be.

490
00:29:01,874 --> 00:29:03,309
We don't know that for sure.

491
00:29:03,309 --> 00:29:05,878
We went inside in good faith.

492
00:29:05,878 --> 00:29:07,980
We have to assume it's no good.

493
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:11,150
So we can't even get him on
playing house with a minor?

494
00:29:14,954 --> 00:29:17,056
We found her clothes
in your apartment.

495
00:29:17,056 --> 00:29:19,659
- A receipt dated a week ago.
- I haven't seen her.

496
00:29:19,659 --> 00:29:22,795
The bank teller remembers you two
opening an account together.

497
00:29:22,795 --> 00:29:25,131
That's a problem, seeing
how you're on probation...

498
00:29:25,131 --> 00:29:29,001
- ...for one statutory rape.
- You got something against pubes?

499
00:29:29,001 --> 00:29:30,970
I didn't do anything wrong.

500
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:33,606
As you see it. You're in love.

501
00:29:33,606 --> 00:29:35,208
- Yeah.
- Forget the fact...

502
00:29:35,208 --> 00:29:36,676
...she's barely out of algebra.

503
00:29:36,676 --> 00:29:39,512
You're connected to the dead women.
We'll find out how.

504
00:29:39,512 --> 00:29:42,882
What I still wanna know is
what happened to Reina.

505
00:29:42,882 --> 00:29:44,717
It's just one more.

506
00:29:44,717 --> 00:29:47,753
- You help us, maybe we can help you.
- I see how you liked her.

507
00:29:47,753 --> 00:29:49,255
Uncomplicated.

508
00:29:49,255 --> 00:29:51,991
Too inexperienced to see
what a xxxx you really are.

509
00:29:51,991 --> 00:29:55,995
I liked her, but I wouldn't be
with her. Her parents were crazy.

510
00:29:55,995 --> 00:29:57,563
She was 14.

511
00:29:57,563 --> 00:29:59,665
You tell the mom I had
something to do with it...

512
00:29:59,665 --> 00:30:01,534
...and she comes by my place.

513
00:30:01,534 --> 00:30:05,071
That's why he wrote the song, right?
To get the parents off your back?

514
00:30:05,071 --> 00:30:07,773
- It's just a song.
- I'm talking to you.

515
00:30:07,773 --> 00:30:09,408
Look at me.

516
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:11,244
I liked her.

517
00:30:11,244 --> 00:30:13,613
- She liked me.
- Enough to go to prison for her?

518
00:30:13,613 --> 00:30:16,482
Or did you hate the mom so much
you made the song come true?

519
00:30:20,553 --> 00:30:21,854
I got it.

520
00:30:22,755 --> 00:30:24,657
She's not a victim, she loves me.

521
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:31,264
Hey! Hey, enough!

522
00:30:31,264 --> 00:30:33,499
Enough. Enough!

523
00:30:39,238 --> 00:30:42,141
You sit down there,
keep your mouth shut.

524
00:30:52,551 --> 00:30:55,087
I had to put a new door on.

525
00:30:55,087 --> 00:30:57,390
Here's the combination.

526
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,994
Write him a check.

527
00:31:31,157 --> 00:31:33,125
<i>All right, enough...</i>

528
00:31:43,403 --> 00:31:44,871
Ever see her before?

529
00:31:44,871 --> 00:31:47,707
She died. Of chemical-meth exposure.

530
00:31:49,142 --> 00:31:50,877
She had a phone number on her.

531
00:31:50,877 --> 00:31:54,747
We checked the records, found out
she used your phone to call it.

532
00:31:54,747 --> 00:31:56,649
Maybe I dialed the wrong number.

533
00:31:56,649 --> 00:31:59,085
And left a message doing
an impression of her?

534
00:31:59,085 --> 00:32:01,588
I have a few cell phones.

535
00:32:01,588 --> 00:32:04,057
I don't keep track of
them all the time.

536
00:32:08,928 --> 00:32:13,299
- What kind of work do you do?
- Whatever I can, whenever I can.

537
00:32:13,299 --> 00:32:15,802
You trying to pass yourself
off as a migrant worker?

538
00:32:17,036 --> 00:32:18,872
I'm from Sinaloa.

539
00:32:18,872 --> 00:32:20,273
We are migrants.

540
00:32:20,273 --> 00:32:21,741
Nice threads.

541
00:32:21,741 --> 00:32:25,078
Must have found better work than
picking strawberries in Oxnard.

542
00:32:25,545 --> 00:32:29,782
Now, she was found with traces of lye
and red phosphorus in her lungs.

543
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:31,651
She worked in a meth lab.

544
00:32:31,651 --> 00:32:33,586
- Horrible.
- Bullshit.

545
00:32:33,586 --> 00:32:36,256
She worked in your meth
lab, she used your phone.

546
00:32:36,256 --> 00:32:37,824
I don't think so.

547
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,762
Vic, Chaydez give you anything?

548
00:32:42,762 --> 00:32:44,664
Nothing.

549
00:32:44,664 --> 00:32:48,134
Hey, thanks for taking all
the heat with Aceveda.

550
00:32:48,134 --> 00:32:50,870
- Where is he now?
- He had to run out.

551
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:54,240
Baodelo was arrested in Sinaloa
last year for manufacturing meth.

552
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,677
No conviction. Not even a
trial, but he was arrested.

553
00:32:57,677 --> 00:33:00,079
What did you expect, the
policía to be honest?

554
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:02,081
I expect them to at least pretend.

555
00:33:02,081 --> 00:33:06,286
Makes three dead ends we've hit.
Chaydez, Baodelo and the narco.

556
00:33:06,286 --> 00:33:09,522
- Your guy know our guy?
- I don't think so. Why?

557
00:33:09,522 --> 00:33:11,991
Because Chaydez is
chewing his ear off.

558
00:33:11,991 --> 00:33:14,160
Maybe our two cases are related.

559
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:18,231
Hey, Dutch, I understand you
lost a department computer?

560
00:33:18,231 --> 00:33:20,900
I saw it missing on
their inventory report.

561
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,903
- Yeah, yeah.
- Still haven't located it?

562
00:33:23,903 --> 00:33:26,039
No, not yet, but it'll turn up.

563
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:28,741
Well, just so you know,
I had to call IAD.

564
00:33:29,842 --> 00:33:32,946
- Excuse me?
- They're gonna have to investigate.

565
00:33:32,946 --> 00:33:35,748
Any missing city property
valued at over $500...

566
00:33:35,748 --> 00:33:38,351
...has to be investigated by IAD.

567
00:33:38,351 --> 00:33:40,253
I just wanted to warn you.

568
00:33:40,253 --> 00:33:42,655
- Smitty do you right?
- Yes, thank you.

569
00:33:43,723 --> 00:33:45,425
Sorry, Dutch boy.

570
00:33:47,694 --> 00:33:49,762
Please tell me you
put her up to that.

571
00:33:49,762 --> 00:33:51,831
I didn't. I'm sorry.

572
00:33:54,434 --> 00:33:56,102
We'll find it.

573
00:33:58,237 --> 00:33:59,839
We'll find it.

574
00:34:07,447 --> 00:34:10,416
- Hey, I'm coming home soon.
- I'm bleeding.

575
00:34:10,416 --> 00:34:13,219
- It's the baby.
<i>- Bleeding? Are you sitting down?</i>

576
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:15,254
- No.
<i>- Sit.</i>

577
00:34:15,254 --> 00:34:18,491
- Did you call your doctor?
<i>- No, I called you.</i>

578
00:34:18,491 --> 00:34:20,960
Page her. Tell them
it's an emergency.

579
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,463
- Shane, our baby.
- Call the doctor, all right?

580
00:34:23,463 --> 00:34:25,598
Lie down. I'm on my
way home right now.

581
00:34:26,766 --> 00:34:28,368
Got something.

582
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:33,039
Our boys Chaydez and Baodelo
are second cousins.

583
00:34:35,842 --> 00:34:40,947
So Chaydez finds out about his
cousin's meth-lab cemetery...

584
00:34:40,947 --> 00:34:44,283
...possibly helps him
bury the bodies.

585
00:34:44,283 --> 00:34:47,987
Then passes one along
to Otilio for the song.

586
00:34:47,987 --> 00:34:51,491
Any thoughts on how to get our killing
cousins to turn against each other?

587
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:55,461
Maybe we should take it to the press.

588
00:34:58,464 --> 00:35:01,801
Not only is Reina not buried by the
tracks, she's not buried at all.

589
00:35:01,801 --> 00:35:05,171
She's alive. So much for
your journalistic integrity.

590
00:35:05,171 --> 00:35:07,073
But I saw a body.

591
00:35:07,073 --> 00:35:10,043
And now you just admitted
to being an accessory.

592
00:35:10,543 --> 00:35:11,778
No. No, I didn't.

593
00:35:11,778 --> 00:35:15,581
Chaydez had a second cousin
in the meth business.

594
00:35:15,581 --> 00:35:18,718
Somehow all his workers seem to
end up dead. That's who you saw.

595
00:35:18,718 --> 00:35:21,220
Thought you were supposed
to get facts right.

596
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,522
That makes you a fraud.

597
00:35:22,522 --> 00:35:25,591
How's that gonna play
down in the barrio?

598
00:35:25,591 --> 00:35:28,461
Thought you guys were supposed
to be all about the truth.

599
00:35:29,829 --> 00:35:32,331
I thought it was the truth.

600
00:35:32,331 --> 00:35:35,234
Yeah, well, I'm gonna make sure
everybody knows it wasn't.

601
00:35:36,369 --> 00:35:37,870
We wouldn't want your fans...

602
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:41,040
...paying good money
for a corrido con job?

603
00:35:45,478 --> 00:35:46,813
They talking?

604
00:35:46,813 --> 00:35:49,515
Chaydez can't keep his mouth shut.

605
00:35:49,515 --> 00:35:51,784
Trish took a bath in
Southern Comfort.

606
00:35:51,784 --> 00:35:53,352
Gotta say, she commits.

607
00:35:53,352 --> 00:35:56,155
Let's hope her Spanish is as
good as her homeless routine.

608
00:35:59,792 --> 00:36:03,329
Chaydez told the truth, the whole
truth, and kept telling the truth.

609
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:05,898
He's hiding her at a friend's.
Name's Joaquin.

610
00:36:05,898 --> 00:36:07,166
We'll find the friend.

611
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:09,936
Also said his cousin runs his
meth lab out of a truck.

612
00:36:09,936 --> 00:36:12,338
Right now it's in an industrial
park in Boyle Heights.

613
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:36,329
Go.

614
00:36:44,537 --> 00:36:46,639
Okay, let's get the trailer open.

615
00:36:48,975 --> 00:36:52,779
Hazardous fumes. Don't
breathe inside the trailer.

616
00:37:18,971 --> 00:37:23,176
Welcome to the land of promise.
Come be our slave.

617
00:37:23,176 --> 00:37:26,579
Yeah, heard that one before.

618
00:37:41,394 --> 00:37:42,695
Chaydez?

619
00:37:45,264 --> 00:37:47,066
Hello, Reina.

620
00:37:47,066 --> 00:37:48,768
We're here to rescue you.

621
00:37:52,238 --> 00:37:54,040
All right, you're gonna wait here.

622
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,975
Do I have to see her now?

623
00:37:55,975 --> 00:37:57,643
Yeah, you do.

624
00:38:00,479 --> 00:38:01,981
Sit down.

625
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:16,562
Reina's safe. She's safe, she's okay.

626
00:38:16,562 --> 00:38:17,997
Where is she?

627
00:38:19,232 --> 00:38:20,967
She's inside.

628
00:38:20,967 --> 00:38:23,035
But there's something I
gotta tell you first.

629
00:38:25,004 --> 00:38:29,442
She went away with
Chaydez on her own.

630
00:38:30,276 --> 00:38:34,580
What? No.

631
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:37,216
She knew that you and your
husband would never approve.

632
00:38:38,618 --> 00:38:40,419
Pero the funeral.

633
00:38:42,088 --> 00:38:44,490
- She didn't come.
- Well, she's young.

634
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:47,293
She thought she was in love.
She made a mistake.

635
00:38:47,293 --> 00:38:48,628
No.

636
00:38:48,628 --> 00:38:50,429
You're wrong.

637
00:38:50,429 --> 00:38:52,665
She's still your daughter.

638
00:38:52,665 --> 00:38:55,401
Reina's only 15. She made a mistake.

639
00:38:55,401 --> 00:38:58,504
Let her fix it. She needs to see you.

640
00:38:59,572 --> 00:39:01,574
No, not now.

641
00:39:15,121 --> 00:39:17,958
Look familiar, you big perv?

642
00:39:17,958 --> 00:39:20,360
- Where was it?
- Desk drawer in the storage room.

643
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:24,064
Also found your renewal card for
Tiger Beat. I mailed it in.

644
00:39:24,064 --> 00:39:26,299
Funny later, not funny now.

645
00:39:29,436 --> 00:39:31,037
You're back.

646
00:39:31,871 --> 00:39:35,442
Yeah, I had this odd feeling I
made a mistake in my paperwork.

647
00:39:35,442 --> 00:39:38,211
- You never made one before.
- Well, you can't be too sure.

648
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:43,583
Maybe you were just
hoping you'd run into me.

649
00:39:43,583 --> 00:39:46,486
There is a difference between
confidence and overconfidence.

650
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,489
Boyfriend cooking for you tonight?

651
00:39:50,123 --> 00:39:51,758
He works weekends.

652
00:39:51,758 --> 00:39:54,427
I can throw parsley on a
plate with the best of them.

653
00:39:55,695 --> 00:39:58,398
- It's a bad idea.
- Name one bad thing about it.

654
00:39:58,398 --> 00:39:59,799
I'm involved.

655
00:39:59,799 --> 00:40:01,801
Mentally, you're already checked out.

656
00:40:03,703 --> 00:40:05,238
What makes you say that?

657
00:40:06,706 --> 00:40:08,608
I'll explain it over dinner.

658
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:12,178
What do you have to
go back to work for?

659
00:40:12,178 --> 00:40:16,249
It's just for a couple hours. We're
just finishing something up.

660
00:40:17,117 --> 00:40:19,919
I'm having a miscarriage
and you're leaving.

661
00:40:19,919 --> 00:40:23,857
It's just spotting. Doc says
everything's gonna be all right.

662
00:40:23,857 --> 00:40:25,492
But you gotta take it easy.

663
00:40:26,326 --> 00:40:28,361
You gotta take care of our baby.

664
00:40:30,363 --> 00:40:32,832
Now, you sure you don't need
anything else before I go?

665
00:40:32,832 --> 00:40:34,868
Just for you to stay.

666
00:40:35,835 --> 00:40:38,571
I'll be back as soon as I can.
I promise.

667
00:40:42,175 --> 00:40:43,643
Bye-bye.

668
00:40:46,246 --> 00:40:47,714
She should know.

669
00:40:47,714 --> 00:40:49,783
Wanna try to draw the
house like this?

670
00:40:50,583 --> 00:40:52,319
That's not bad.

671
00:40:53,453 --> 00:40:54,954
Hey, guys.

672
00:40:54,954 --> 00:40:56,823
Can we watch a movie tonight, Daddy?

673
00:40:56,823 --> 00:40:58,758
Maybe. What's going on?

674
00:40:58,758 --> 00:41:00,760
Can I talk to you for a second?

675
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,761
Sure.

676
00:41:02,896 --> 00:41:04,397
Hi, honey.

677
00:41:05,131 --> 00:41:08,601
- Hey, sis.
- It's okay.

678
00:41:08,601 --> 00:41:11,071
- Can I ask a favor?
- What?

679
00:41:11,071 --> 00:41:13,139
Can you take the kids this weekend?

680
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:15,141
I don't have them until next weekend.

681
00:41:15,141 --> 00:41:17,444
- Please.
- Why?

682
00:41:18,578 --> 00:41:21,548
I have some things I
have to do and I am....

683
00:41:26,052 --> 00:41:28,221
I don't want them to be
around me like this.

684
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:32,492
Has something happened?

685
00:41:32,492 --> 00:41:33,893
Is it your mother?

686
00:41:35,695 --> 00:41:36,963
No.

687
00:41:38,531 --> 00:41:41,901
Did you know it would be this hard?

688
00:41:41,901 --> 00:41:43,937
This empty?

689
00:41:49,209 --> 00:41:51,244
I didn't know what it would be.

690
00:41:51,811 --> 00:41:53,713
I'm having a hard time.

691
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:09,362
Can you take the kids this weekend?

692
00:42:09,362 --> 00:42:11,564
- I really don't want them to...
- Sure, sure.

693
00:42:11,564 --> 00:42:14,434
- I'll take them next weekend.
- That's okay, I miss them.

694
00:42:14,434 --> 00:42:16,102
Okay, great.

695
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:20,039
I'm gonna be all right.

696
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:21,708
Okay.

697
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:32,852
I'm sorry, I can't do tonight.

698
00:42:32,852 --> 00:42:35,455
- Everything okay?
- Better offer.

699
00:42:35,455 --> 00:42:37,424
Two nights with my kids.

700
00:42:39,459 --> 00:42:40,927
It's probably a sign.

701
00:42:40,927 --> 00:42:45,098
- It's a scheduling snafu. Next week?
- No, it feels like a sign.

702
00:42:47,066 --> 00:42:50,236
Maybe we'll catch another
case again together sometime.

703
00:43:07,086 --> 00:43:10,557
We made the case against Chaydez.
Found Reina.

704
00:43:10,557 --> 00:43:11,958
Good.

705
00:43:16,296 --> 00:43:19,532
- What's this?
- lnterrogation-room tape from today.

706
00:43:20,667 --> 00:43:24,337
You cut me a break when I
went off the grid for Tommy.

707
00:43:24,337 --> 00:43:28,141
- Can't stand owing you something.
- Dad, let's go.

708
00:43:28,141 --> 00:43:29,909
I'm coming, baby.

709
00:43:35,748 --> 00:43:37,283
Hey, Rigo.

710
00:43:39,319 --> 00:43:42,522
There a family reunion
I didn't know about?

711
00:43:42,522 --> 00:43:44,290
How you doing, man?

712
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,195
You all right?

713
00:43:57,403 --> 00:44:00,773
- What, and you couldn't stop them?
- He had a gun to my head.

714
00:44:00,773 --> 00:44:03,710
- You couldn't do anything?
- What would you have done?

715
00:44:06,646 --> 00:44:09,549
- Does Aurora know?
- Nobody knows.

716
00:44:14,754 --> 00:44:16,990
Man, all I wanted to do was survive.

717
00:44:18,758 --> 00:44:20,426
See my wife and....

718
00:44:23,062 --> 00:44:25,632
See my wife and my little girl again.

719
00:44:28,067 --> 00:44:31,204
And now all I do is make
up excuses not to go home.

720
00:44:33,406 --> 00:44:35,174
You did what you had to do.

721
00:44:37,577 --> 00:44:39,279
No one can blame you.

722
00:44:40,213 --> 00:44:42,248
I went after a suspect today.

723
00:44:42,248 --> 00:44:44,417
And I kicked the shit out of him.

724
00:44:46,085 --> 00:44:48,555
The only thing that stopped me was...

725
00:44:48,555 --> 00:44:50,690
...I started to piss my pants.

726
00:44:53,793 --> 00:44:55,862
I'm losing control of everything.

727
00:44:56,596 --> 00:44:58,565
Then take it back.

728
00:45:01,935 --> 00:45:03,803
I don't know how.

729
00:45:05,071 --> 00:45:06,806
You're a captain.

730
00:45:07,307 --> 00:45:08,808
You command 200 men.

731
00:45:08,808 --> 00:45:11,678
Hell, you're gonna be the
next city councilman.

732
00:45:11,678 --> 00:45:14,047
You have power, David.

733
00:45:14,047 --> 00:45:16,950
You have a gun and a badge.

734
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:19,919
Now, these were just a
couple of punk assholes.

735
00:45:22,121 --> 00:45:23,856
Do you know who they are?

736
00:45:27,427 --> 00:45:28,895
I could find out.

737
00:45:31,598 --> 00:45:34,400
But even then, what?

738
00:45:36,469 --> 00:45:39,806
If it was me, I'd kill them.
