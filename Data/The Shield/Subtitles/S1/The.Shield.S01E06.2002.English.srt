00:00:01,067 --> 00:00:03,036
<i>Previously on The Shield:</i>

2
00:00:03,036 --> 00:00:05,471
Hooker murders are up
for the entire East Side.

3
00:00:05,471 --> 00:00:07,440
Would you forget about making
a name for yourself...

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,008
...as the great serial killer hunter.

5
00:00:09,709 --> 00:00:11,644
-He had a knife.
-Gentleman?

6
00:00:11,644 --> 00:00:13,746
I go to put the condom on
and the asshole...

7
00:00:13,746 --> 00:00:16,382
...he smacked me and
he tried to raped me.

8
00:00:16,382 --> 00:00:19,752
Bag it.

9
00:00:19,752 --> 00:00:22,655
The street ain't seen blow this
strong since Grand Master Flash.

10
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:27,794
You're certain there were six bricks.

11
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:31,030
Six or seven,
definitely more than four.

12
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,298
Where's Mackey?

13
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:37,503
Where is it?

14
00:00:37,503 --> 00:00:38,838
What are you talking about?

15
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,109
Hey, treat yourself to a full
cavity search if you like.

16
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:44,744
I need my Ding Dongs...

17
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:46,980
-...and you took them, didn't you?
-Right.

18
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,749
Stay away from me and
stay away from my desk.

19
00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:57,824
You gotta be shitting me.

20
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:02,996
Christ, how old is this one, 13?

21
00:01:03,429 --> 00:01:04,697
Man.

22
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:10,570
Hooker?
Face down like the other four?

23
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:14,240
Looks that way.
I warned you about this guy.

24
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,675
Yes, you did.

25
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:19,479
Couple up the hill saw a green car
cruising back and forth an hour ago.

26
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,848
-They get a model?
-Just said it was green.

27
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:23,850
-And the driver?
-Too dark.

28
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,385
Car had a busted taillight.

29
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:26,753
-What side?
-Didn't say.

30
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,522
Go back. Grill them.
Every detail.

31
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:33,426
This happened on our turf.

32
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:36,095
You give me the resources,
I'll get this guy.

33
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:37,430
What kind of resources?

34
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,566
Every warm body you can spare
for as long as possible.

35
00:01:40,566 --> 00:01:44,037
-Personnel is stretched thin as it is.
-I need 48 hours.

36
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,005
I can't do it.

37
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:50,109
A predator was standing right here
less than two hours ago.

38
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,213
How committed are we to catching him?

39
00:01:56,249 --> 00:02:00,053
For the next 24 hours,
she's your one and only case.

40
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:02,221
Medical examiner tells us...

41
00:02:02,221 --> 00:02:05,124
...the victim is approximately
12 to 14 years of age.

42
00:02:05,124 --> 00:02:07,260
A 12-to 14-year-old hooker.

43
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,962
Frank, you and your boys round up
every pimp and pro you can find.

44
00:02:09,962 --> 00:02:11,731
Bring 'em here for me to talk to.

45
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:15,435
Neighbor saw a green car pass by
an hour before the body was found.

46
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:17,637
The right rear taillight was broken.

47
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:21,574
Check in with every gas station, car
wash, valet guy in the neighborhood.

48
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:24,010
June, put together a reward flyer.

49
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:27,580
Photo of the girl, description of the
car, mention the broken taillight.

50
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,783
She had keys in her purse. Vic, you
and your guys find a locksmith.

51
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:32,418
See if you can track the numbers.

52
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:34,353
-Excuse me?
-Sit down with a locksmith.

53
00:02:34,353 --> 00:02:37,557
You want me, I'll be out finding
the prick who did this.

54
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:38,758
Come on.

55
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:43,229
Either we get our unsub
in the next 24 hours...

56
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:46,933
...or we probably don't get another
chance until he kills again.

57
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,001
Let's go.

58
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:52,405
Vic!

59
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:54,373
Yes, Herr Wagenbach?

60
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:58,077
You got a problem with me running
the show, take the night off.

61
00:02:58,077 --> 00:02:59,679
I thought you wanted
this case solved.

62
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:00,480
I do.

63
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,082
No. You only care about
being the one who solves it.

64
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:05,351
When I do, I don't want
it thrown out of court...

65
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,786
...because of your Gestapo tactics.

66
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:08,755
Let's get something straight, Dutch.

67
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:11,858
Somebody comes into my backyard
and kills a girl, I get involved.

68
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,826
I'll crack this case
with or without you.

69
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:15,495
Looks like it'll have to be with.

70
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:17,296
This investigation runs through me.

71
00:03:17,296 --> 00:03:19,565
You find something,
you report it immediately.

72
00:03:19,565 --> 00:03:22,769
I bring the guy in, you'll be
the first to know, Dutch boy.

73
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:38,418
People see me as a joke around here.
They don't know the real me.

74
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,754
I'm not sure the squad's
ready for the real you.

75
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:42,990
-I'm not a joke.
-I know that.

76
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,858
Now they'll know it, too.

77
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,127
I'm gonna get this guy!

78
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:50,063
It's a little early in the game
to be making promises, isn't it?

79
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:53,000
The one thing they respect is success.

80
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,203
I guess we'd better
nail this guy then.

81
00:03:56,203 --> 00:03:57,838
What do we got?

82
00:03:57,838 --> 00:04:00,207
Body found at midnight...

83
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:04,277
...green car seen in
the park at 11:00.

84
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:06,213
The victim has no identification.

85
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:10,183
Prostitute. Age 12 to 14.
Had a sweet tooth.

86
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:11,752
Had birth-control pills.

87
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:15,489
They don't make 12-year-olds
like they used to.

88
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:22,062
I was wondering what was going on
with the whole Strike Team thing.

89
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:24,598
The apartment turned
up empty for cocaine.

90
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,533
We have no hard proof
of Mackey's guilt.

91
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:29,202
That doesn't mean Vic and his guys
didn't steal the drugs.

92
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:33,340
-I know, but without hard evidence...
-I saw them pocket the cocaine.

93
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,143
You can get the car thief to testify
she found the coke.

94
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:38,612
-It's not that easy.
-Why not?

95
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:42,416
Because I'm not gonna put you in
a position to carry that weight.

96
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,551
But you want Mackey off the streets.

97
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:47,988
More than you know, which is why I
won't let you be the one to do it.

98
00:04:47,988 --> 00:04:51,525
-Captain, I don't understand.
-Exactly. You don't understand.

99
00:04:52,426 --> 00:04:55,228
So take my advice and let this go.

100
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:57,164
-Captain, I saw them...
-Julien.

101
00:04:58,198 --> 00:04:59,366
Let this go.

102
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:08,008
-How you doing?
-Been working my ass off.

103
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:12,446
-Might be time to take a vacation.
-I can't afford to.

104
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,781
Had to drop my price.

105
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,918
-Why?
-Would you pay top dollar for this?

106
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:26,126
I guess it could be worse.

107
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:29,062
Found her a few hours ago.
Know who she is?

108
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:31,765
Looks like the girl who works
kitty-corner from Tracy.

109
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:35,001
-Where?
-Across from the burrito joint.

110
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,436
Know who pimps her out?

111
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:39,039
No.

112
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:41,541
But Tracy would.

113
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,377
Thanks.

114
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,250
This guy has a thing
for working girls.

115
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,219
Make sure somebody's
watching your back.

116
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:53,687
I thought that's what you did.

117
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,655
I don't want to see
you get hurt again.

118
00:05:56,156 --> 00:05:58,024
I won't let it happen twice.

119
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:04,297
Does anyone know who this girl is?

120
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:09,436
Look at it! Who knows her?

121
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:11,805
That's Sally.

122
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:15,208
Sally who?

123
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,043
Sally Struthers?

124
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:21,414
-All in the Family.
-I know who Sally Struthers is.

125
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:23,984
Maybe she saw one of those
"Save the Kids" ads.

126
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:25,986
Whatever, that's the name she went by.

127
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:29,322
Good news is, our timeline's
starting to come into focus.

128
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:33,660
Her friends said Sally usually started
her shift around 10:00...

129
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,328
...but didn't show last night.

130
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:39,399
Another one said she saw her
going into a drugstore on Vermont...

131
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,600
...at 7:00 p.m.

132
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,702
When you're a young
girl on a Friday night,...

133
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:44,871
...hat would you do
between 7:00 and 10:00?

134
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:48,308
Shop. Eat. See a movie.

135
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:49,943
Jim Wright, FBI.

136
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:52,045
Someone called the Bureau
asking for assistance?

137
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:54,714
I did. Dutch Wagenbach.
You got here fast.

138
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:56,483
This is my partner,
Claudette Wyms.

139
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:57,584
Good to meet you.

140
00:06:58,351 --> 00:06:59,486
So...

141
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,889
We've got an unsub killing hookers.

142
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:05,692
Been there. Done that.

143
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:08,395
This girl was only 12, 13.

144
00:07:08,395 --> 00:07:10,163
You did the right thing calling us.

145
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:13,900
Most local cops are afraid we're gonna
come in, step all over their toes.

146
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,670
Not me. I can't wait
to pick your brain.

147
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,371
Let me be clear.

148
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:20,040
This is your case.

149
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,075
I'm just here to help.

150
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,917
What are you boys chewing? A little
grilled Snoopy, side of Woodstock?

151
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,520
We're clean.

152
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:37,591
-Think about tryin' a rib eye?
-What do you want?

153
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:40,093
-You remember your friend Sally?
-Nope.

154
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:42,429
-Really? Never pimped her out?
-Nope.

155
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:45,098
-You know absolutely nothing?
-Less than nothing.

156
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:48,034
Really? So that apartment
over on Weston...

157
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:50,237
...where you keep all that
fenced electronics...

158
00:07:50,237 --> 00:07:52,172
...you don't remember that either.

159
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:54,708
What do you say,
you wanna make Robbery Division's day?

160
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:57,310
Yeah, sounds sweet.
Very sweet.

161
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:01,982
I'll call in the warrant.
Lady, where's the phone?

162
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:04,851
-It's over there.
-Yeah, okay.

163
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:12,692
-Yeah, you were pimping her out?
-She came to us. We did her a favor.

164
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:15,262
-So you never took a cut?
-20 percent.

165
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:18,398
Plus a few free pokes a week.

166
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:23,136
Wipe those smiles off
your faces, shitheads.

167
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:26,006
You don't score points with me
bagging 12-year-olds.

168
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:31,111
What kind of work she do
before tricking for you?

169
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:34,080
I heard she'd worked this sex club.

170
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,582
She was a kid.

171
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:36,683
So?

172
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:39,352
So what kind of work could she do
for a sex club?

173
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:43,590
-You'll have to ask them.
-Don't worry. I will.

174
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,426
I'm impressed you were able
to pick up on this guy.

175
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:50,063
I've done a lot of
research on criminology,...

176
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:52,499
-...behavioral science unit.
-It shows.

177
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:55,035
Dutch!

178
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,337
I got a gas station
attendant here who says...

179
00:08:57,337 --> 00:08:58,772
...he might have seen
your green car.

180
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:02,709
Detective, I got a guy
who saw our flyer.

181
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,744
Said he sold drugs to
the victim earlier.

182
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:07,147
Gotta love it when a case gets warm.

183
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:10,517
So I'm working,
and I see this suspicious white guy.

184
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:11,685
Suspicious how?

185
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:13,586
He was white.

186
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:17,691
So I go out to get a good look at him,
and he turned away.

187
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:19,392
The dude didn't want me
to see his face.

188
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,928
-Tell me about the car.
-It was green.

189
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:24,898
Two-door, four-door? Ford, Chevy?

190
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:28,168
You do work in a gas station, right?

191
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:29,769
<i>I just run the register.</i>

192
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,238
You sold Sally drugs tonight?

193
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,740
She had a thing for ecstasy.

194
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,475
You're admitting to a crime.

195
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:40,180
I'm a minor. My lawyer can
argue it's for personal use.

196
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,150
Was Sally for personal use, too?

197
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,618
She was a customer.

198
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:47,654
Did you know she was a prostitute?

199
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:49,089
How do you think she paid me?

200
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:54,394
I hooked her up with
five hits around 8:30.

201
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:56,429
Five? She always buy that much?

202
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:59,265
Said it got her through the night.
So...

203
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:02,202
-How much is this reward?
-Reward?

204
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:04,371
"For useful information."

205
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:06,539
You know, like the flyer said.
That's why I'm here.

206
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,275
So what's my reward?

207
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:12,645
Dealing drugs to a minor,
statutory rape.

208
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:16,816
-How does six months to a year sound?
-What?

209
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:19,652
<i>-No license plate?
</i>-Better, I got evidence.

210
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:22,255
-He paid with a credit card?
-No, man, cash.

211
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:25,558
See, he paid with $20 at the
automatic teller. He only pumped $17.

212
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:29,028
He never came back for his change.
Who doesn't want their $3 change?

213
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,131
So you kept the $20?

214
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:35,101
No, that was part of my night deposit.
I saved his change, though.

215
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:36,569
You saved $3 in change?

216
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:38,671
Yeah, you can dust
'em for fingerprints.

217
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:41,674
-But he never touched them.
-No, but it's his $3.

218
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,676
That's gotta help somehow, right?

219
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:49,682
Captain, we've got a problem.
What?

220
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:52,352
The toilets in the women's bathroom
aren't working.

221
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:54,854
-What do you mean not working?
-They're clogged.

222
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:57,524
Don't look at me.

223
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:59,392
So, we have no working
toilets in the barn?

224
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:00,560
Right.

225
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,929
-You call maintenance?
-Can't send someone 'till tomorrow.

226
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:05,031
-Call a plumber.
-Who's gonna pay for it?

227
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:07,801
Use my credit card.
Just get someone down here.

228
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:14,941
Buddy!

229
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,911
Imagine meeting you here.

230
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:20,346
Excuse me?
You remember me. Vic.

231
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,881
Your best friend from Boston?

232
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:23,416
I've never been to Boston.

233
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:26,219
Come on!

234
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,656
Come on, Ted.

235
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:32,225
You remember,
we went to high school together.

236
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:34,828
-Give me my wallet! I don't know you!
-Right.

237
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:36,729
Now you're about to
tell me you weren't...

238
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:38,364
...about to go into that sex club.

239
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,868
-Sex club? That's a sex club?
-Yeah, Ted.

240
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:44,204
Members only.

241
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,139
And tonight, I'm your guest.

242
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:51,010
Thanks for taking me
on such short notice.

243
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:54,681
Ted is one of our best clients.
We like to keep him happy.

244
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:57,083
Sounds like you do a
great job of that.

245
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,953
Will you be watching
or taking part tonight, Vic?

246
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:03,857
Watching. I like to test the
waters before I jump in.

247
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:07,160
You'll be watching Sun-Lee tonight.

248
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:09,128
Excellent.

249
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:11,898
MRS. Afterwards,
we have tapes if you're interested.

250
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,399
I'm sure I will be.

251
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,007
I won't pull any punches.
She's critical.

252
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:23,309
She? You mean the pipes?

253
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:26,346
You eat well?
Get a physical once a year?

254
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:29,315
-Flush out your pipes regularly?
-I see where you're going.

255
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:32,218
Right, maintaining a healthy
sewage system is no different.

256
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:35,121
-Can you get them working or not?
-I'll see what I can do.

257
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:39,292
Why have you been making noises
about contacting IAD?

258
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:43,029
-Who told you that?
-You think word wouldn't get out?

259
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:44,597
It was just a question.

260
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,099
Why do you want IAD?

261
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,567
'Cause I saw something.

262
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,603
-Saw what?
-You don't want to know.

263
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:54,140
Forget about the "what," then.
Who are you talking about?

264
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,476
You know what?
I'm not talking about anyone.

265
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:58,578
The more I say,
the less people wanna listen.

266
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:00,446
People here prefer to
cover things up...

267
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,782
...and hope I'll just shut up
and go away.

268
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:11,117
What about my wallet?

269
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:16,423
I ever see you within
five blocks of here,...

270
00:14:16,423 --> 00:14:18,391
...your wife will get a
very unpleasant call.

271
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:19,526
Screw!

272
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,831
-Hello?
-Yo, Billy.

273
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:26,833
It's Vic.
I'm sorry to call you so late.

274
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,569
Look, I got a probable cause
for a no-knock warrant.

275
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:31,504
What was that all about?

276
00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:33,773
I saw what I saw. I
just can't let it lie.

277
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:36,409
Goddamn it.
You don't know what you're doing here.

278
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:39,813
-I know right from wrong, Captain.
-I told you to let this go.

279
00:14:39,813 --> 00:14:42,248
I may answer to you,
but I also have to answer to God.

280
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:46,319
And I will never be at peace with Him
or myself if I turn my back on this.

281
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:49,189
You think you really want to do this?

282
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:50,790
Because here's
what's gonna happen.

283
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,159
Most cops here will treat
you like a traitor.

284
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:56,029
You're gonna take more shit
than you've ever taken before!

285
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:59,733
You're gonna be testifying
against Vic Mackey, and trust me...

286
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:02,102
...he doesn't care if
God is on your side.

287
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:04,571
Are you ready for that kind of heat?

288
00:15:05,472 --> 00:15:06,806
I'll have to be.

289
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:11,010
Warrant! Police!
Get against the wall, hands up!

290
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:14,147
Down! Get on your knees right now!

291
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:16,383
Get down on the ground on your knees!

292
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:23,189
On your knees! Get in line!
Come on, girls! What's wrong with you?

293
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:25,792
-Line up on your knees!
-Where are the tapes?

294
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:27,427
<i>Come on, hurry up!</i>

295
00:15:29,229 --> 00:15:30,463
<i>Hurry up!</i>

296
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,336
"Cherry Popper Films"?

297
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,205
Boy, you really take the cake,
don't you, lady?

298
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:40,673
Come on, back up!

299
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:43,076
All right then, let's go!

300
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:46,045
Come on, now.

301
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,047
Vic!

302
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:50,850
What do you want to do with the girl?

303
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,652
Keep her in the clubhouse for now.

304
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:55,321
Where the hell are
Shockley and Peters?

305
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:57,056
Robbery-homicide call.

306
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:58,291
What? Come on!

307
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,827
They're supposed to be going over
witness statements for me.

308
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:02,829
It's a robbery-homicide, Dutch.

309
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:05,265
Look out!

310
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:11,671
For God's sake!

311
00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:17,210
Wait, get the files.
Jesus. Get my files and the Rolodex!

312
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,646
Get what you can!
Put it on your desks.

313
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:21,648
Come on!
Get me that other file over there!

314
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:23,116
Which one? This one?

315
00:16:24,451 --> 00:16:26,486
You got a big problem
with these pipes.

316
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:34,694
Just what I need.
A goddamn flood in my workspace.

317
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:38,698
-I made a quick profile of our killer.
-What do you got?

318
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:42,602
Our unsub's late 20s, early 30s.

319
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:47,373
Sporadic employment,
feels unappreciated, worthless.

320
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:49,042
Why does he pose them face down?

321
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:51,878
Symbolizes the domination
he yearns for.

322
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:55,815
He's probably impotent, though.
At least with a live girl.

323
00:16:55,815 --> 00:16:58,184
Dutch, we got a hit off the flyer!

324
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:02,155
Tipster says he saw a guy with Sally
in a green vehicle.

325
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:05,458
-We get the caller's address?
-Right here.

326
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:06,926
Yes.

327
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:33,553
Tom Ross.

328
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,155
The flyer said that this
would be confidential.

329
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:37,390
How'd you get my address?

330
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,592
Tip line's routed through 911.

331
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,129
If this guy's a killer,
I don't want him coming after me.

332
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:46,032
Your name doesn't
leave this room, Tom.

333
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:48,902
-Just tell us what you saw.
-Okay.

334
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:52,338
Basically I was out
last night driving...

335
00:17:52,338 --> 00:17:54,941
...and I was stopped at a light
behind this green car.

336
00:17:54,941 --> 00:17:58,311
There was a guy driving and it seemed
that he was having a struggle...

337
00:17:58,311 --> 00:18:00,146
...with a girl in the passenger seat.

338
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:01,948
The girl from the flyer?

339
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:03,016
I think so.

340
00:18:03,016 --> 00:18:04,918
I was behind them, but...

341
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:08,054
...it looked weird enough
that I wrote the license plate down.

342
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:10,523
Did you notice
if one of his taillights was broken?

343
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:12,225
I think so.

344
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:14,160
Yeah.

345
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:17,664
Run this plate,
cross-reference with the owner.

346
00:18:17,664 --> 00:18:20,066
-Give me a DMV photo.
-Computers are down.

347
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:20,967
What?

348
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:22,835
They had to unplug
them due to the flood.

349
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:24,270
Goddamn it.

350
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,941
Then call Central, have them run
the plate number, fax over a photo.

351
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:29,742
The fax machine's unplugged, too.

352
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:32,512
Then send someone over to Central,
pick up the photo personally.

353
00:18:32,512 --> 00:18:33,680
Who should I send?

354
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,149
Could you just take care of
this thing for me, please?

355
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:39,786
Each of my workers had
documentation saying they were 18.

356
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:44,357
-From what, a cereal box?
-I said, I want to see my lawyer.

357
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:48,861
-What do you got here?
-Busted an underage sex shop.

358
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:50,430
Looks like a cherry popper ring, too.

359
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,065
Cherry popper?

360
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:55,568
Preteen girls losing their virginity.
The filmmaker's next on my hit list.

361
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:57,337
What's the connection to Sally?

362
00:18:57,337 --> 00:18:58,905
She worked there a
couple of months ago.

363
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:00,106
A couple of months ago?

364
00:19:00,106 --> 00:19:02,408
How does that help
me with last night?

365
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:03,476
It doesn't.

366
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,912
So you've just been doing
your own thing on your own time.

367
00:19:05,912 --> 00:19:09,415
Don't chew up my ass just because
your case is coming up short.

368
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:11,818
You couldn't give me a
little goddamn help...

369
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:14,287
...with tracking down
the victim's keys?

370
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:16,556
I was putting a teenage sex show
out of business.

371
00:19:16,556 --> 00:19:19,392
And I'm trying to catch a killer,
asshole!

372
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:21,961
Jesus Christ.

373
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:29,469
We gotta watch these,
find out who's behind 'em.

374
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:33,406
-Man, you gotta be kidding me.
-I know. I can't stomach this shit.

375
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:35,208
Yell if you find anything.

376
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:43,016
Hi, Steve.

377
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,085
I'm Detective Wagenbach.

378
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:47,987
What's going on? Why am I down here?

379
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:53,793
<i>Your name came up
</i>in an investigation of ours.

380
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:57,363
Investigation? Of what?

381
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,799
Do you drive a '97
green Saturn, Steve?

382
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:00,800
Yeah.

383
00:20:01,668 --> 00:20:03,036
Is that a good car?

384
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:04,804
I guess, yeah.

385
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:06,139
Reliable?

386
00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:07,573
No problems with it?

387
00:20:08,508 --> 00:20:10,543
I had some work done on the brakes.

388
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:11,911
What about the taillights?

389
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:13,413
Taillights?

390
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:15,581
You got any broken
taillights on your car?

391
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:16,683
No.

392
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,351
You sure?

393
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:20,687
I don't think so.

394
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:23,489
'Cause we checked your car out.

395
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,591
<i>You checked out my car?</i>

396
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,127
<i>Why?</i>

397
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:30,163
You got a broken right taillight.

398
00:20:32,699 --> 00:20:33,900
Okay.

399
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:44,944
Hi.

400
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:47,547
What happen me now?

401
00:20:51,284 --> 00:20:53,553
You get to play blackjack with Vic.

402
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,688
Not in trouble?

403
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,659
Only if you take me for all my money.

404
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,368
Who made you work for Mrs. Park?

405
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,738
Mrs. Park help me.

406
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:15,174
She pay ticket. $10,000.

407
00:21:15,174 --> 00:21:16,776
She's not helping you.

408
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:19,212
She help me star in more movies.

409
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,118
19.

410
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,255
You understand that what you did...

411
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:31,858
...that's not a real movie.

412
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:34,360
It start, though.

413
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:40,433
15.

414
00:21:40,433 --> 00:21:41,934
Vic is forced to hit.

415
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,738
10. That's a bust.

416
00:21:46,506 --> 00:21:47,707
You win.

417
00:21:48,074 --> 00:21:49,475
Sun-Lee win?

418
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,145
Yeah.

419
00:21:57,116 --> 00:21:59,051
Were you popular in
high school, Steve?

420
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,255
I had friends.

421
00:22:03,856 --> 00:22:05,958
That's not really the
same thing, is it?

422
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:08,528
You can always find some other
dork to eat lunch with.

423
00:22:08,528 --> 00:22:10,229
Doesn't make you popular, you know?

424
00:22:10,963 --> 00:22:12,165
Guess not.

425
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:17,170
The reason I'm curious
about your high school years is...

426
00:22:18,137 --> 00:22:20,840
...you've got a sealed juvie record.

427
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,809
You're not supposed
to know about that.

428
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:27,046
We know about it. We just don't know
exactly what your crime was.

429
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,948
How about clueing me in?

430
00:22:29,315 --> 00:22:30,516
No.

431
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:31,951
A little embarrassing, is it?

432
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:35,021
Either tell me what I'm doing here,
or I'm leaving.

433
00:22:36,756 --> 00:22:38,891
I don't have to tell
you anything, Steve.

434
00:22:38,891 --> 00:22:40,793
Fine. I'm going, then.

435
00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:42,395
You're not going anywhere.

436
00:22:49,936 --> 00:22:52,071
Sunshine. How you doing?

437
00:22:52,071 --> 00:22:54,607
This bathroom emergency thing's
a real nightmare.

438
00:22:54,607 --> 00:22:57,476
Don't worry about it.
High tide's not for a few more hours.

439
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:03,082
Listen, there's
something you should...

440
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:05,117
-Forget it.
-No.

441
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:07,453
Too late. Come on.

442
00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:09,922
-I really shouldn't.
-You're breaking my heart.

443
00:23:09,922 --> 00:23:11,791
I can get fired for telling you.

444
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:15,094
Not if we keep it
between us, sunshine.

445
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:24,170
David just had me put
a call in to IAD.

446
00:23:24,871 --> 00:23:27,807
IAD? Goddamn it!

447
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:31,777
I can't believe he
would do this to you.

448
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:34,614
It's not me I'm worried about.
I didn't do anything.

449
00:23:34,614 --> 00:23:37,049
I just know that your guy's
already not fitting in.

450
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:38,885
He makes a mistake like this...

451
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:41,654
As his training officer,...

452
00:23:41,654 --> 00:23:44,090
...I just don't want any of
that mud sticking to you.

453
00:23:44,891 --> 00:23:48,261
-I'll talk to him.
-Don't be too hard. He's a good kid.

454
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:49,562
He means well.

455
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:52,331
He's just confused.

456
00:23:52,331 --> 00:23:54,233
I'm not supposed to talk about it.

457
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:57,603
-You're going to IAD about Vic?
-It is really none of your business.

458
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:59,739
You're my partner. It's my business.

459
00:23:59,739 --> 00:24:01,974
Can we just let this rest, please?

460
00:24:01,974 --> 00:24:04,110
Look, Vic is a great cop.

461
00:24:04,677 --> 00:24:06,746
You don't testify against
a fellow officer...

462
00:24:06,746 --> 00:24:08,381
...without looking
them in the eye...

463
00:24:08,381 --> 00:24:09,715
...and hearing their side.

464
00:24:09,715 --> 00:24:11,918
I don't know what your
deal is with him,...

465
00:24:11,918 --> 00:24:13,386
...but it doesn't change
what happened.

466
00:24:13,386 --> 00:24:16,022
You're wrong about Vic.
Give him a chance to explain...

467
00:24:16,022 --> 00:24:18,190
You can't explain stealing evidence!

468
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,192
That's right, Danny.

469
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:22,762
He stole two bricks of cocaine,
and I saw him do it.

470
00:24:22,762 --> 00:24:25,698
And whether you realize it or not,
you helped him cover it up.

471
00:24:25,698 --> 00:24:28,100
Now stop asking me about this.

472
00:24:36,076 --> 00:24:38,378
The file says you haven't
held a steady job...

473
00:24:38,378 --> 00:24:40,447
...in more than three months, Steve.

474
00:24:41,114 --> 00:24:43,750
-Economy stinks.
-You must be angry.

475
00:24:44,684 --> 00:24:47,187
Nobody likes to feel unappreciated...

476
00:24:47,187 --> 00:24:48,488
...worthless.

477
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:49,989
I don't feel that way.

478
00:24:51,825 --> 00:24:55,261
No, you're a powerful guy. Where
were you last night around 11:00?

479
00:24:56,396 --> 00:24:59,632
-At home in bed.
-Anyone to corroborate that?

480
00:25:00,967 --> 00:25:02,402
That I was in bed?

481
00:25:02,936 --> 00:25:04,003
I wish.

482
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:06,239
You wish what?
That there was a girl in your bed?

483
00:25:06,239 --> 00:25:08,041
That you could get it up with a girl?

484
00:25:08,041 --> 00:25:10,210
-What are you talking about?
-What's so private...

485
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:12,278
...about this sealed
juvie record of yours?

486
00:25:12,278 --> 00:25:14,214
-It's sealed.
-What's hidden?

487
00:25:14,214 --> 00:25:16,750
You're a peeping Tom? A stalker?

488
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,818
Like to kill cats? What?

489
00:25:22,355 --> 00:25:24,124
I broke into my high school.

490
00:25:25,158 --> 00:25:28,495
-I trashed the place.
-Sure, I can see that.

491
00:25:29,796 --> 00:25:32,132
You like to destroy things, don't you?

492
00:25:34,601 --> 00:25:36,102
Dutch!

493
00:25:36,102 --> 00:25:39,672
We just found Sally in one of these
goddamn Cherry Popper tapes. Come on!

494
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:44,077
While your lawyer's on the way...

495
00:25:45,345 --> 00:25:47,647
...we're gonna have a
little screening party.

496
00:25:48,748 --> 00:25:52,452
We're gonna watch that tape
until one of two things happens.

497
00:25:52,452 --> 00:25:55,755
Either you're gonna tell me
everything you know about Sally...

498
00:25:55,755 --> 00:25:57,957
...or I'm gonna have to turn it off.

499
00:25:58,591 --> 00:26:00,894
But if I have to turn that tape off...

500
00:26:02,162 --> 00:26:04,431
...there are no more rules
in this room.

501
00:26:43,036 --> 00:26:44,604
Turn it off.

502
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,049
I got her from Kurt Schmidt.

503
00:26:56,749 --> 00:26:58,318
He makes the movies.

504
00:26:58,918 --> 00:27:01,054
And how do I find Kurt?

505
00:27:11,364 --> 00:27:12,599
You okay?

506
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,602
That was Sally.

507
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,771
She's a kid.

508
00:27:21,441 --> 00:27:22,509
She was.

509
00:27:25,945 --> 00:27:28,681
-The asshole that made her do that...
-Don't worry.

510
00:27:28,681 --> 00:27:29,916
He's mine.

511
00:27:30,884 --> 00:27:32,285
Good.

512
00:27:34,654 --> 00:27:36,356
Ramirez just called in.

513
00:27:36,356 --> 00:27:40,860
A 14-year-old kid saw the flyer,
says he's Sally's boyfriend.

514
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:44,564
-Why would someone do that to her?
-That's what we're trying to find out.

515
00:27:45,398 --> 00:27:48,301
You were Sally's boyfriend?

516
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:50,603
Yeah.

517
00:27:50,603 --> 00:27:52,338
When was the last time you saw her?

518
00:27:53,473 --> 00:27:56,709
Last night. We met at
this ice-cream place.

519
00:27:56,709 --> 00:27:58,144
What time was that?

520
00:27:58,945 --> 00:28:02,348
She left right before 10:00.
Are you sure?

521
00:28:02,882 --> 00:28:06,386
Yeah, that's when her curfew is.
She has to be home by 10:00.

522
00:28:06,386 --> 00:28:07,687
Where did she live?

523
00:28:07,687 --> 00:28:09,656
I never saw her house.

524
00:28:09,656 --> 00:28:13,393
She said her parents were traditional,
didn't let her have boys over.

525
00:28:13,393 --> 00:28:16,296
She was your girlfriend for how long?

526
00:28:16,296 --> 00:28:17,564
A few months...

527
00:28:17,564 --> 00:28:20,133
...but it only started
getting serious last week.

528
00:28:20,133 --> 00:28:21,267
Serious?

529
00:28:22,101 --> 00:28:24,704
That's when she finally kissed me.

530
00:28:26,639 --> 00:28:29,542
She was young,
she wanted to take it slow.

531
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:33,212
Did you have any idea
what Sally did for a living?

532
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,349
She was a freshman, right?

533
00:28:42,422 --> 00:28:44,791
Hi, Vic. Play cards?

534
00:28:45,291 --> 00:28:46,526
A little later.

535
00:28:46,526 --> 00:28:48,995
Right now, I need you to show
me the guy who made your movie.

536
00:28:49,696 --> 00:28:51,064
How come?

537
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:53,333
To help me with my case.

538
00:28:54,367 --> 00:28:55,969
I helped you out, right?

539
00:28:56,502 --> 00:28:58,404
You think you could help me out, too?

540
00:28:59,105 --> 00:29:01,107
-Yes.
-Good.

541
00:29:01,107 --> 00:29:03,376
Vic mad at Sun-Lee?

542
00:29:03,776 --> 00:29:05,511
No. Not at you.

543
00:29:06,512 --> 00:29:09,115
You should be with your
family, being a kid.

544
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:11,884
Which one is he?

545
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,788
He.

546
00:29:15,788 --> 00:29:17,490
That man put me in movie.

547
00:29:24,764 --> 00:29:26,165
I can't talk about it.

548
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:33,439
Look, I just haven't been a good
listener or a good training officer.

549
00:29:37,176 --> 00:29:38,978
I was scared to believe you.

550
00:29:39,846 --> 00:29:42,382
-Believe him, then.
-No.

551
00:29:42,915 --> 00:29:44,751
I want to believe the truth.

552
00:29:45,652 --> 00:29:48,921
If you just tell me what the truth is,
I promise I'll listen.

553
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:55,328
So she's at the ice-cream
store here at 9:45.

554
00:29:55,995 --> 00:29:58,531
She heads to work at 10:00.

555
00:29:59,232 --> 00:30:01,434
The fastest way to her corner's here.

556
00:30:02,035 --> 00:30:04,637
Which means she was picked up
somewhere on Cassandra Street.

557
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:06,773
-Yeah.
-Forget a full confession.

558
00:30:07,373 --> 00:30:11,411
All you have to do is get him to admit
he was on Cassandra at 10:00.

559
00:30:11,411 --> 00:30:13,046
You get him to say that...

560
00:30:13,046 --> 00:30:15,648
...with all the circumstantial
evidence, you got him.

561
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:16,816
I'll get him to say it.

562
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:20,853
Ding Dong?

563
00:30:22,221 --> 00:30:23,523
No, thanks.

564
00:30:28,628 --> 00:30:30,496
I think we're almost done here, Steve.

565
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:36,135
-Kurt Schmidt?
-Yeah?

566
00:30:36,135 --> 00:30:37,336
You're under arrest.

567
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:39,906
-For what, man?
-Makin' movies!

568
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:44,977
-Get off me, man! I'm an editor.
-Cherry Popper movies, you sick prick.

569
00:30:44,977 --> 00:30:46,579
You can't prove that.

570
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:51,184
I got tapes and witnesses, asshole.
The only question left...

571
00:30:51,184 --> 00:30:55,054
...is whether you took a header into
the concrete trying to resist arrest.

572
00:30:55,054 --> 00:30:57,356
-You got a girlfriend, Steve?
-No!

573
00:30:58,925 --> 00:31:00,493
<i>I remember my 20s.</i>

574
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,628
<i>Rough times.</i>

575
00:31:03,096 --> 00:31:06,566
<i>Too old for the college girls,
</i>too young for the mature ones.

576
00:31:06,566 --> 00:31:07,967
What do you mean?

577
00:31:07,967 --> 00:31:11,104
Not being able to get
a date, get laid.

578
00:31:12,004 --> 00:31:13,473
Pisses you off.

579
00:31:14,974 --> 00:31:17,610
Aren't I, like,
entitled to a lawyer or something?

580
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:18,778
Entitled?

581
00:31:19,645 --> 00:31:21,013
You, entitled?

582
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:26,953
What about Kitty Weir?
What about Rosita Pedrazo?

583
00:31:26,953 --> 00:31:29,989
What about Mary Esposito?
What about Sheryl Watkins?

584
00:31:29,989 --> 00:31:31,991
What about Sally, Steve?

585
00:31:33,926 --> 00:31:36,129
What were they entitled to?

586
00:31:36,129 --> 00:31:37,396
Don't show me those.

587
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:39,031
You don't like looking
at your own work?

588
00:31:39,031 --> 00:31:41,067
Is that why you place
'em face down?

589
00:31:41,067 --> 00:31:43,770
So you don't look 'em in the eye
after you kill 'em?

590
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:45,638
You think I killed those girls?

591
00:31:45,638 --> 00:31:49,075
-I know you killed them, Steve.
-No way!

592
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:51,744
Fine.

593
00:31:52,512 --> 00:31:53,713
Fine!

594
00:31:54,847 --> 00:31:56,382
You didn't kill 'em.

595
00:31:58,684 --> 00:32:02,054
But at least don't lie to me
about where you were last night.

596
00:32:02,054 --> 00:32:03,356
I'm not!

597
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:08,227
We have a witness...

598
00:32:09,462 --> 00:32:13,132
...who saw you in your green car...

599
00:32:13,132 --> 00:32:15,134
...on Cassandra Street...

600
00:32:15,134 --> 00:32:17,436
...with the broken taillight...

601
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:19,005
...at 10:00.

602
00:32:20,306 --> 00:32:23,176
So don't lie to me.

603
00:32:23,843 --> 00:32:27,680
At least tell me the truth
about this one thing.

604
00:32:29,715 --> 00:32:30,950
Witness?

605
00:32:34,554 --> 00:32:36,889
You're not talking about Tom, are you?

606
00:32:37,356 --> 00:32:38,524
Tom?

607
00:32:38,524 --> 00:32:39,692
Yeah.

608
00:32:40,393 --> 00:32:41,894
Tom Ross.

609
00:32:41,894 --> 00:32:44,096
Is he the one who says he saw me?

610
00:32:48,534 --> 00:32:51,237
Jesus. It's Tom, isn't it?

611
00:32:52,238 --> 00:32:54,307
This one just raised the bar.

612
00:32:54,307 --> 00:32:55,708
Raised the bar?

613
00:32:55,708 --> 00:32:58,678
For practical jokes.
It's a prank, man.

614
00:32:58,678 --> 00:33:00,613
We're always trying
to one-up each other,...

615
00:33:00,613 --> 00:33:03,082
...and he probably heard
about these girls...

616
00:33:03,082 --> 00:33:06,118
<i>Dude, man, you scared the
</i>shit out of me with that.

617
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,355
<i>-A prank?
</i>-Shit.

618
00:33:09,355 --> 00:33:11,724
Is Tom here now?
Please tell me he's here.

619
00:33:11,724 --> 00:33:13,259
He's here.

620
00:33:13,259 --> 00:33:16,128
Great. Dude, you gotta do me a favor.

621
00:33:16,128 --> 00:33:18,130
You gotta help me get him back.

622
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:21,400
When you see him, you gotta act
like you're super-pissed...

623
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,136
...and tell him he's under arrest
for something.

624
00:33:24,136 --> 00:33:25,338
Like...

625
00:33:26,873 --> 00:33:29,275
-Obstruction of justice?
-Perfect.

626
00:33:29,275 --> 00:33:30,977
It was just a joke, man!

627
00:33:30,977 --> 00:33:33,946
The broken light? It was on the
flyer, so I broke Steve's.

628
00:33:33,946 --> 00:33:36,916
-Do you realize what you did?
-Have a sense of humor, dude.

629
00:33:36,916 --> 00:33:38,885
A little girl's killer
is still out there...

630
00:33:38,885 --> 00:33:40,553
...because you're the class clown!

631
00:33:40,553 --> 00:33:42,221
Easy!

632
00:33:42,221 --> 00:33:44,857
Sally's murderer is still out there...

633
00:33:44,857 --> 00:33:47,126
...and I'm standing here
with my xxxx in my hand...

634
00:33:47,126 --> 00:33:49,328
...because this guy
thought it would be funny...

635
00:33:49,328 --> 00:33:51,464
...to rake his buddy over the coals.

636
00:33:51,464 --> 00:33:52,765
All right.

637
00:33:53,366 --> 00:33:54,667
Screw him.

638
00:33:55,902 --> 00:33:59,572
-We've still got time.
-I just wasted seven hours. Gone.

639
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,075
I'm sorry. I gotta take this.

640
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:05,711
Dutch.

641
00:34:06,479 --> 00:34:09,015
You got a job to do. Do it.

642
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:14,921
Connie?

643
00:34:16,689 --> 00:34:19,225
Jesus Christ. What happened?

644
00:34:20,626 --> 00:34:22,728
He's the killer maybe, right?

645
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:34,974
He's an insurance salesman
from Fresno.

646
00:34:34,974 --> 00:34:37,743
-What did you do here?
-He was acting strange.

647
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:39,278
So you shot him?

648
00:34:39,879 --> 00:34:41,414
I didn't want him to hurt me.

649
00:34:41,414 --> 00:34:43,783
-How much you been smokin'?
-No.

650
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,652
You gotta help me, Vic.

651
00:34:46,652 --> 00:34:48,754
Christ, Connie!

652
00:34:49,956 --> 00:34:51,791
Can't you say that you shot him?

653
00:34:51,791 --> 00:34:53,726
There's at least 10
cops who can place me...

654
00:34:53,726 --> 00:34:55,394
...at the barn when
this went down.

655
00:34:55,394 --> 00:34:57,863
I thought that he was gonna kill me!

656
00:34:57,863 --> 00:34:59,832
That story's not gonna cut it!

657
00:34:59,832 --> 00:35:01,667
I'll lose my son.

658
00:35:03,369 --> 00:35:04,870
Vic! Please!

659
00:35:05,571 --> 00:35:07,073
Think of something!

660
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:12,845
What is it?

661
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:17,683
No. Clean yourself up.
I gotta call this in.

662
00:35:17,683 --> 00:35:20,753
You thought of somethin'!
I know you did!

663
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:25,191
-I'm sorry, Connie. My hands are tied.
-All I have is Brian.

664
00:35:26,993 --> 00:35:28,961
Don't let me lose him.

665
00:35:35,534 --> 00:35:37,837
You'll need a better story.

666
00:35:37,837 --> 00:35:39,238
Okay.

667
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:44,043
All right, you had sex.
You asked him to pay.

668
00:35:44,043 --> 00:35:47,313
He said he didn't have to pay,
that he was gonna make you pay.

669
00:35:47,313 --> 00:35:50,483
He started hitting you.
He took out his gun.

670
00:35:50,483 --> 00:35:53,386
You fought him off.
You took it and shot him.

671
00:35:53,886 --> 00:35:55,121
Do you have that?

672
00:35:56,722 --> 00:35:58,891
I asked him to pay.

673
00:35:59,892 --> 00:36:03,696
He said he didn't have to,
and he hit me. That's good.

674
00:36:04,864 --> 00:36:07,466
Your friends, they'll believe that?

675
00:36:08,868 --> 00:36:11,137
Only if you have the
bruises to prove it.

676
00:36:16,642 --> 00:36:17,943
Okay.

677
00:36:35,227 --> 00:36:38,230
-I can't.
-It's okay! Come on!

678
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:41,100
-I can't! No.
-Do it!

679
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,536
-Hit me!
-No.

680
00:36:43,536 --> 00:36:46,639
-Hit me! Come on, hit me!
-No!

681
00:36:50,509 --> 00:36:51,844
Please?

682
00:36:52,211 --> 00:36:53,712
Vic, please.

683
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:58,217
Please.

684
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,192
Hit me.

685
00:37:21,307 --> 00:37:22,876
So where does that leave us?

686
00:37:22,876 --> 00:37:25,211
We know she disappeared
on Cassandra Street.

687
00:37:25,211 --> 00:37:26,746
So far, no witnesses.

688
00:37:26,746 --> 00:37:28,248
Anything from the park?

689
00:37:28,248 --> 00:37:30,416
I did a full sweep. Nothin'.

690
00:37:30,416 --> 00:37:32,285
-Maybe forensics'll...
-No.

691
00:37:33,453 --> 00:37:36,723
This guy didn't leave any forensics
on the first four victims.

692
00:37:36,723 --> 00:37:38,658
He's only gonna get better,
not sloppier.

693
00:37:38,658 --> 00:37:41,160
Then I'm callin' the rest of the units
off this one.

694
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,128
What?

695
00:37:42,128 --> 00:37:43,997
A huge brawl started
at Council Rock High.

696
00:37:43,997 --> 00:37:46,032
Sixty students from rival schools.

697
00:37:46,032 --> 00:37:49,802
-I need everyone I can get over there.
-You promised me 24 hours.

698
00:37:49,802 --> 00:37:52,972
I'm sorry, Dutch.
I just don't have the bodies.

699
00:37:57,143 --> 00:37:59,445
So a dead hooker gets 21 hours?

700
00:37:59,445 --> 00:38:01,648
What would she get
if she was a mayor's daughter?

701
00:38:02,649 --> 00:38:05,218
Claudette is gonna go
back into rotation.

702
00:38:05,218 --> 00:38:09,088
Now, you show me some new evidence,
clues, a viable lead...

703
00:38:09,088 --> 00:38:10,423
...and then we'll talk.

704
00:38:11,057 --> 00:38:13,159
You're assigning
the same amount of manpower...

705
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:15,728
...to find a serial killer
as you are to fix our pipes?

706
00:38:15,728 --> 00:38:17,964
Getting mad doesn't
change how life works.

707
00:38:17,964 --> 00:38:19,532
She deserves better.

708
00:38:20,399 --> 00:38:21,568
I know.

709
00:38:29,342 --> 00:38:31,544
You did all you could. It's not over.

710
00:38:32,946 --> 00:38:34,480
I need an aspirin.

711
00:38:48,861 --> 00:38:50,730
Dutch, you're soakin' yourself.

712
00:38:54,033 --> 00:38:55,168
You okay?

713
00:38:56,069 --> 00:38:57,103
Sure.

714
00:38:57,103 --> 00:38:59,505
Dutch, you think
we could find some time to study?

715
00:39:00,773 --> 00:39:01,774
What?

716
00:39:01,774 --> 00:39:02,909
For the sergeants exam.

717
00:39:02,909 --> 00:39:05,812
I feel like I'm, you know,
kind of fallin' behind.

718
00:39:06,613 --> 00:39:07,847
Sure.

719
00:39:09,115 --> 00:39:10,883
Why don't we do that right now?

720
00:39:10,883 --> 00:39:14,621
I'll just drop my pissant serial
killer thing to help you study.

721
00:39:14,621 --> 00:39:17,256
Because what you want always
comes first, doesn't it?

722
00:39:17,256 --> 00:39:20,560
It comes before me,
comes before everybody else here!

723
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,329
Even comes before a dead
13-year-old girl...

724
00:39:23,329 --> 00:39:26,466
...we're all supposed
to just forget about, come tomorrow.

725
00:39:26,466 --> 00:39:28,401
So grab your books.

726
00:39:28,968 --> 00:39:32,472
Let's find a nice, quiet spot!
We'll study for that test right now.

727
00:39:34,007 --> 00:39:35,241
Yeah?

728
00:39:42,782 --> 00:39:44,283
We had sex.

729
00:39:47,687 --> 00:39:50,923
And then I asked, told him to pay.

730
00:39:52,125 --> 00:39:53,826
He said he didn't have to.

731
00:39:56,596 --> 00:39:58,598
That's when he started hitting me.

732
00:40:00,333 --> 00:40:01,634
You did good.

733
00:40:02,835 --> 00:40:04,437
I'm scared.

734
00:40:04,437 --> 00:40:05,838
You're halfway home.

735
00:40:07,206 --> 00:40:09,809
Just tell the detectives
the same thing.

736
00:40:11,878 --> 00:40:13,513
I'm gonna change, Vic.

737
00:40:14,881 --> 00:40:16,449
I'm gonna clean up...

738
00:40:18,751 --> 00:40:20,486
...be a mother to Brian.

739
00:40:23,122 --> 00:40:24,624
It's gonna be okay.

740
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,668
Get clean,...

741
00:40:35,668 --> 00:40:37,303
...change,...

742
00:40:37,303 --> 00:40:38,938
...be a good mother.

743
00:40:41,708 --> 00:40:43,242
I'm gonna do it.

744
00:40:45,945 --> 00:40:47,213
Sun-Lee.

745
00:40:49,615 --> 00:40:50,950
I go now?

746
00:40:53,753 --> 00:40:56,622
I called INS. I'm sending
you back to Korea.

747
00:40:57,423 --> 00:41:00,960
-But you say you help Sun-Lee!
-I am. This is the best thing for you.

748
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,029
You don't know what
like for me there.

749
00:41:03,029 --> 00:41:04,430
I know what it's like here.

750
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:06,365
Parents never take me back!

751
00:41:06,365 --> 00:41:09,569
If they won't take you,
the authorities will.

752
00:41:09,569 --> 00:41:13,973
You'll be sent to a foster home,
to school. Someone'll look after you.

753
00:41:13,973 --> 00:41:17,143
-Sun-Lee come back. I will!
-Maybe.

754
00:41:17,543 --> 00:41:20,780
But even if it only buys you six
months, I can live with that.

755
00:41:23,683 --> 00:41:24,817
I'm sorry.

756
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:31,958
Watch your step here.

757
00:41:33,793 --> 00:41:36,095
Wait.

758
00:41:43,803 --> 00:41:44,871
I'm sorry.

759
00:41:50,777 --> 00:41:52,445
She looked like Sally.

760
00:41:53,346 --> 00:41:54,781
Almost was Sally.

761
00:41:57,750 --> 00:41:59,018
Dutch.

762
00:42:00,186 --> 00:42:02,155
You showed me somethin' today.

763
00:42:02,155 --> 00:42:04,357
What do you mean? I failed.

764
00:42:04,357 --> 00:42:06,159
No, you didn't.

765
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:09,061
We took down
some bad guys doin' some bad stuff.

766
00:42:09,061 --> 00:42:10,563
You did that, not me.

767
00:42:10,563 --> 00:42:13,800
We both did it.
We'll get your guy, too.

768
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,535
Just won't be today.

769
00:42:15,535 --> 00:42:16,836
No, it won't.

770
00:42:19,238 --> 00:42:23,810
Serial cases are a marathon.
It's not sprints.

771
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:28,314
I remember workin'
the Green River case in 1984.

772
00:42:29,949 --> 00:42:31,818
Forty-nine bodies.

773
00:42:31,818 --> 00:42:34,487
I had 50 times your resources.

774
00:42:35,655 --> 00:42:37,323
1984.

775
00:42:38,024 --> 00:42:40,593
We made our first arrest last year.

776
00:42:43,162 --> 00:42:45,231
Doesn't hurt if you don't let it.

777
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,468
Place should be clear by morning.

778
00:42:52,805 --> 00:42:53,873
Here's your bill.

779
00:43:00,246 --> 00:43:03,182
-$800?
-Yeah. Cash only. I don't take credit.

780
00:43:03,182 --> 00:43:04,684
I'll have to go to an ATM.

781
00:43:04,684 --> 00:43:06,986
No problema, amigo.
I'll be here all night.

782
00:43:06,986 --> 00:43:08,454
Gracias, amigo.

783
00:43:17,363 --> 00:43:18,497
Hey.

784
00:43:20,499 --> 00:43:21,567
What's up?

785
00:43:24,604 --> 00:43:27,006
Did you steal drugs
from those Armenians?

786
00:43:27,006 --> 00:43:29,876
-Not you, too.
-Look, Vic.

787
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:34,247
I owe you too much to ever repeat
your answer to anyone...

788
00:43:35,147 --> 00:43:38,084
...but if I helped you get away
with it, I gotta know the truth.

789
00:43:39,018 --> 00:43:40,319
Did you steal drugs?

790
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:42,855
You can ask me this after what
happened the other night?

791
00:43:42,855 --> 00:43:44,490
The goddamn bust of the year...

792
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:46,926
...and your partner's
got you as mixed up as he is.

793
00:43:48,895 --> 00:43:52,231
Just give me some time to get
things sorted out in my head, okay?

794
00:43:52,231 --> 00:43:54,433
-Danny.
-Please.

795
00:43:55,835 --> 00:43:57,536
I just want some space.

796
00:44:12,885 --> 00:44:14,453
What I said to you...

797
00:44:15,655 --> 00:44:17,123
...was inexcusable.

798
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,295
This case...

799
00:44:23,629 --> 00:44:25,431
...was very important to me.

800
00:44:27,833 --> 00:44:29,135
When I was a kid...

801
00:44:31,237 --> 00:44:32,638
You know what?

802
00:44:34,473 --> 00:44:36,609
At least I had a childhood.

803
00:44:36,609 --> 00:44:37,843
I lived.

804
00:44:38,678 --> 00:44:40,680
It's just pathetic to
complain about it now.

805
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:44,784
It's even more pathetic
to use it as some kind of excuse.

806
00:44:46,285 --> 00:44:47,820
I don't have an excuse.

807
00:44:49,155 --> 00:44:51,157
I was wrong, and I'm sorry.

808
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:55,528
Good night.

809
00:44:57,630 --> 00:44:59,031
Dutch.

810
00:45:03,836 --> 00:45:05,071
You hungry?

811
00:45:07,606 --> 00:45:09,775
'Cause I make a mean grilled cheese.
