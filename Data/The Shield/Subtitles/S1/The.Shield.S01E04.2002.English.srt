1
00:00:00,972 --> 00:00:02,370
<i>Previously on The Shield:</i>

2
00:00:02,461 --> 00:00:03,721
I went through the books.

3
00:00:03,812 --> 00:00:05,601
Think I saw Mackey talking to
his drug dealer, a guy named...

4
00:00:05,692 --> 00:00:07,182
Named Rondell Robinson.

5
00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:09,221
You think Mackey working
for a drug dealer?

6
00:00:09,312 --> 00:00:11,370
I'm suggesting the drug
dealer is working for Mackey.

7
00:00:12,073 --> 00:00:13,331
What are you getting out of this?

8
00:00:13,422 --> 00:00:15,214
I just want a dirty
cop off the street.

9
00:00:15,305 --> 00:00:16,870
You wanna be Mayor someday?

10
00:00:16,961 --> 00:00:18,886
You better learn how to lie
hell lot better than that.

11
00:00:27,159 --> 00:00:28,550
I know what's wrong with Vic.

12
00:00:28,641 --> 00:00:31,409
I just don't want us accused
of whitewashing anything.

13
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,987
The last thing we need...

14
00:00:33,078 --> 00:00:35,300
...is another chapter
in the Rodney King-O.J. book.

15
00:00:35,391 --> 00:00:37,096
I don't wanna be a chapter
in that book, either.

16
00:00:37,187 --> 00:00:39,042
My source at Justice
is all over my ass.

17
00:00:39,133 --> 00:00:42,081
He wants to know if you made us
all accomplices to a murder.

18
00:00:43,268 --> 00:00:45,565
Terry got overeager.
He got himself killed.

19
00:00:45,656 --> 00:00:46,682
End of story?

20
00:00:46,773 --> 00:00:48,003
End of story.

21
00:00:48,094 --> 00:00:49,253
You know you did it.

22
00:00:49,344 --> 00:00:51,354
Up until now, I have tolerated you.

23
00:00:51,445 --> 00:00:55,042
You come near my men again,
I'm gonna lose patience.

24
00:00:56,339 --> 00:00:57,596
You listening?

25
00:00:58,182 --> 00:00:59,354
I know.

26
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:06,632
Damn, girl! That's what I'm
talking about.

27
00:01:18,607 --> 00:01:20,710
Don't shake that in my man's face.

28
00:01:22,224 --> 00:01:25,478
-Who are all these white folk?
-They're from the record label.

29
00:01:29,661 --> 00:01:32,049
Yeah. Give me that, girl. Yeah.

30
00:01:33,099 --> 00:01:37,262
-How does she move like that?
-That's what the guys like.

31
00:01:37,552 --> 00:01:38,830
Sir...

32
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:42,209
You've had too much to drink.

33
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,432
Who are you?

34
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:48,622
-I'm a cop.
-You undercover?

35
00:01:48,712 --> 00:01:51,667
Security. So behave yourself.

36
00:01:51,757 --> 00:01:53,746
Everybody put your
hands together...

37
00:01:53,836 --> 00:01:56,309
...for all the ladies
shaking it up in here.

38
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,063
Word up!

39
00:02:03,228 --> 00:02:04,434
Word up, y'all.

40
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:08,403
I wanna thank everybody for coming
out to my album release party.

41
00:02:08,493 --> 00:02:10,826
"Back From the Ashes,"
you know what I'm saying?

42
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:13,127
Feels good to be
back behind the mike.

43
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:14,446
Hey, Kern!

44
00:02:14,536 --> 00:02:18,130
-Do that duet with Tyesha.
-Rondell in the house.

45
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:21,590
Where Tyesha at? Where Tyesha at?
Come here.

46
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:26,360
This is Kern's party, y'all.

47
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:28,600
My release party ain't gonna be
for another month.

48
00:02:29,892 --> 00:02:31,944
-Trouble.
-You can hear me sing then.

49
00:02:32,034 --> 00:02:34,215
-Tonight's Kern's night.
-Where my money, Kern?

50
00:02:34,305 --> 00:02:36,439
Yo, there go the thief right there.

51
00:02:37,135 --> 00:02:39,717
I want my money, homey.
Where my money, Kern?

52
00:02:39,807 --> 00:02:42,066
-Hey, yo. Hey, hey, hey.
-I want my money.

53
00:02:42,156 --> 00:02:43,992
-My beef ain't with you, playboy.
-What?

54
00:02:44,082 --> 00:02:46,583
-If it's with Kern, it's with me.
-Hey, back up.

55
00:02:46,673 --> 00:02:48,364
This is a private party.

56
00:02:48,454 --> 00:02:50,260
You can't get into trouble.

57
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:53,339
Do I have to call in the cavalry?
Step back.

58
00:02:53,429 --> 00:02:56,820
Police can't protect you
forever, Kern. Remember that.

59
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,389
-Get out of here. Go.
-It's T-Bonz, homey.

60
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:03,346
-Punk ass out of here, man.
-You heard me. Go.

61
00:03:03,978 --> 00:03:06,805
-Get lost, bitch.
-Who you calling a bitch?

62
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,322
Stay down! Shit!

63
00:03:20,252 --> 00:03:21,319
Danny, you all right?

64
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:23,675
Hey, man, those fools were shooting
up in here.

65
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:26,801
-Lemon!
-Somebody call 911!

66
00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:30,975
Rumble in the jungle.

67
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,397
-What happened?
-Two dead, six wounded.

68
00:03:36,353 --> 00:03:38,405
T-Bonz and his crew
were looking for a fight...

69
00:03:38,495 --> 00:03:41,034
...and Rondell and some of Kern's guys
gave it to him.

70
00:03:41,124 --> 00:03:43,464
-Don't tell me.
-Rondell was the shooter.

71
00:03:43,554 --> 00:03:45,458
It's just what we needed.

72
00:03:46,252 --> 00:03:49,512
Hey. Hey, Vic.
You're missing all the fun.

73
00:03:50,275 --> 00:03:52,158
Dutch, how many times
I got to tell you,...

74
00:03:52,248 --> 00:03:53,945
...you can't feel up
the witnesses.

75
00:03:54,035 --> 00:03:58,470
-Took one in the ass. Bet it's not...
-It's not the first time. Good one.

76
00:03:59,002 --> 00:04:01,963
Look who's the last one
to a "shots fired" call.

77
00:04:02,721 --> 00:04:05,964
All safe and secure, captain.
Shooting stopped.

78
00:04:06,054 --> 00:04:07,444
Nothing to worry about here.

79
00:04:09,697 --> 00:04:11,180
You two were moonlighting?

80
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:14,044
Our shift commander signed off on it.

81
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,005
Any suspects in custody?

82
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:19,914
Well, the night is young.
Let me do my thing.

83
00:04:20,572 --> 00:04:23,658
Do you mind if I include others
in this investigation?

84
00:04:23,748 --> 00:04:25,260
You sign the checks.

85
00:04:26,424 --> 00:04:27,607
Pete and Dutch team up.

86
00:04:27,697 --> 00:04:29,928
Strike Team will assist
as they see fit.

87
00:04:30,486 --> 00:04:31,861
Any problems with that?

88
00:04:32,611 --> 00:04:34,405
Just that time's a-wasting.

89
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:37,239
I won't put up with shooting galleries
in Farmington.

90
00:04:37,329 --> 00:04:39,702
Find out who pulled the triggers
and bring them in.

91
00:04:42,307 --> 00:04:43,884
Knute Rockne, he ain't.

92
00:04:48,361 --> 00:04:50,935
I may have to put up with you
working under my roof...

93
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:52,975
...but it's still my roof.

94
00:04:54,197 --> 00:04:55,633
So just do your job...

95
00:04:56,572 --> 00:04:58,551
...and stay out of my way.

96
00:05:00,564 --> 00:05:03,059
Sounds like good
advice for both of us.

97
00:05:10,564 --> 00:05:11,860
Let's get to work.

98
00:05:22,857 --> 00:05:25,156
-The guy throwing the party...
-Kern Little.

99
00:05:25,245 --> 00:05:27,817
And this T-Bonz,
they weren't the shooters?

100
00:05:28,153 --> 00:05:31,328
-Not that I saw. Just their pals.
-Can you ID any of them?

101
00:05:32,302 --> 00:05:33,384
I can look through the books.

102
00:05:33,474 --> 00:05:35,851
This will spill into
the street quick.

103
00:05:35,941 --> 00:05:38,738
Let's talk to both generals,
get them to stand down their armies.

104
00:05:38,828 --> 00:05:40,788
-Starting where?
-Kern Little.

105
00:05:40,878 --> 00:05:43,534
-Who's Kern Little?
-Listen, Dutchboy...

106
00:05:43,624 --> 00:05:47,063
...don't get your clogs all dirty.
We'll deal with Kern Little.

107
00:05:49,396 --> 00:05:52,021
-Who is it?
-Open up, Rondell.

108
00:05:54,239 --> 00:05:57,217
-What's up, Vic?
-Why'd you shoot up the Chez Club?

109
00:05:57,307 --> 00:06:01,650
Hey, man, T-Bonz and Kern
got this war going on, man.

110
00:06:02,489 --> 00:06:05,302
-I'm just backing up my boy.
-Who's that? Kern?

111
00:06:05,392 --> 00:06:06,598
Hey, this thing high-def?

112
00:06:06,688 --> 00:06:09,131
Yeah. Don't get your
prints on it, man.

113
00:06:09,221 --> 00:06:10,596
Sweet.

114
00:06:10,686 --> 00:06:15,040
Look, me and Kern, we been hanging
since we was kids. We're still tight.

115
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:18,723
Don't you mean Kern financed
your entry into the drug business?

116
00:06:18,813 --> 00:06:21,373
Yeah. No comment.
But that's the rumour.

117
00:06:21,463 --> 00:06:23,941
What's the beef between
Kern and T-Bonz?

118
00:06:24,031 --> 00:06:26,143
T-Bonz was on Kern's
record label.

119
00:06:26,233 --> 00:06:28,609
Then he started selling
a lot of discs.

120
00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:32,657
T-Bonz split, start his own outfit.
Hey, bad blood ever since.

121
00:06:32,747 --> 00:06:36,351
-Hey, what's with all the vinyl here?
-Hey, hey, hey, it sounds better.

122
00:06:36,441 --> 00:06:38,789
Would you put those back
the way you found them.

123
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:41,802
That's my Blue Note collection.
I got them chronological from...

124
00:06:41,892 --> 00:06:45,434
-Did you hit anybody last night?
-Look, if somebody got smoked...

125
00:06:45,524 --> 00:06:48,328
...it wasn't me. I was just shooting
to be shooting.

126
00:06:48,418 --> 00:06:49,606
Give me your piece.

127
00:06:50,567 --> 00:06:52,560
Come on, come on, just give it to me.

128
00:06:55,442 --> 00:06:58,176
Keep your dealers inside
until I give the all clear.

129
00:06:58,266 --> 00:07:00,053
I don't want more
targets on the street.

130
00:07:00,143 --> 00:07:03,514
Vic, man, come on.
Business is going to take a big hit.

131
00:07:03,604 --> 00:07:06,658
Then take it.
You get to deliver product...

132
00:07:06,748 --> 00:07:10,334
...only so long as this neighbourhood
doesn't resemble the Gaza Strip.

133
00:07:10,424 --> 00:07:12,455
Now, that was our deal. You remember?

134
00:07:13,388 --> 00:07:14,527
Yeah, I remember.

135
00:07:15,474 --> 00:07:17,523
Set up a meet. Me and Kern Little.

136
00:07:17,613 --> 00:07:21,040
-Man, why you need me to do that?
-You two are buds.

137
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:23,869
-I want it to be on friendly terms.
-Anything else, man?

138
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:27,341
Yeah. I need two shooters
from your side.

139
00:07:28,536 --> 00:07:32,454
Come on, man, you kidding.
Come on, man. No.

140
00:07:32,544 --> 00:07:33,735
Is it gonna be you?

141
00:07:34,427 --> 00:07:36,222
And I run your gun through ballistics?

142
00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:38,716
Or you got some names for me?

143
00:07:39,771 --> 00:07:42,404
-Welcome to the Barn.
-Make yourselves at home.

144
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:48,857
Just doing my job.
And staying out of your way.

145
00:07:57,271 --> 00:07:59,868
-You look great.
-Stay focused.

146
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:03,039
Now, he owns three different
car dealerships.

147
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:05,745
Him, a chain of grocery stores.

148
00:08:05,835 --> 00:08:07,952
There's more money here
than in Mexico City.

149
00:08:09,185 --> 00:08:11,982
-Which one's Machado?
-Right there.

150
00:08:12,072 --> 00:08:13,263
This whole thing is his baby.

151
00:08:13,353 --> 00:08:15,385
You better say hi
before he disappears.

152
00:08:15,475 --> 00:08:18,584
-Okay.
-Remember how we talked about it.

153
00:08:18,674 --> 00:08:20,741
-I'll wing it.
-David...

154
00:08:20,831 --> 00:08:24,231
-I'm joking.
-This could be your one chance.

155
00:08:24,321 --> 00:08:27,117
-You ready?
-As I'll ever be.

156
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:29,302
Senor Machado. I'm David Aceveda.

157
00:08:29,392 --> 00:08:32,406
Our young police captain. Welcome.

158
00:08:32,496 --> 00:08:35,523
It's an honour to meet you.
This is my wife, Aurora.

159
00:08:35,613 --> 00:08:38,816
What a wonderful
housing development.

160
00:08:38,906 --> 00:08:41,795
It's a step forward in improving
our neighbourhood.

161
00:08:41,885 --> 00:08:44,970
-I'm glad you both could come.
-Thank you for including us.

162
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,445
I'm in your debt.

163
00:08:47,099 --> 00:08:49,496
Don't think me overly generous, David.

164
00:08:49,586 --> 00:08:52,251
As you'll discover,
I often have ulterior motives.

165
00:08:52,341 --> 00:08:56,093
You see, you're actually in a position
to help me.

166
00:08:56,183 --> 00:08:57,457
How so?

167
00:08:58,005 --> 00:08:59,546
My nanny hasn't
seen her husband...

168
00:08:59,636 --> 00:09:01,811
...since he left the
house a few days ago.

169
00:09:01,901 --> 00:09:03,228
He's a day-worker.

170
00:09:03,318 --> 00:09:06,616
Waits for jobs by the home
improvement centre in your district.

171
00:09:08,732 --> 00:09:11,186
Well, is this absence
unusual for him?

172
00:09:11,275 --> 00:09:12,749
Not exactly.

173
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:15,350
They are an emotional couple.

174
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,280
They fight, he leaves, he comes back.
But he has never been gone this long.

175
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:24,462
My nanny's quite upset, which means
my wife is upset, which means...

176
00:09:24,552 --> 00:09:26,834
I don't have to tell you
what that means.

177
00:09:29,724 --> 00:09:31,858
Just give me the
pertinent information.

178
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,863
I'd be glad to help.

179
00:09:36,935 --> 00:09:39,222
Looks as if I am now in your debt.

180
00:09:42,841 --> 00:09:44,918
-You listening to this?
-It's sweet.

181
00:09:45,008 --> 00:09:46,740
Sing me a song about last night.

182
00:09:47,849 --> 00:09:49,576
Man, that'd be a short-ass song.

183
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:54,048
As soon as I seen them dudes coming
with them big guns...

184
00:09:54,138 --> 00:09:56,080
...I just got Tyesha the hell up
out of there.

185
00:09:58,185 --> 00:09:59,208
Nice place.

186
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:02,132
I told everybody my first studio
gonna be in Farmington.

187
00:10:02,222 --> 00:10:06,330
You can't record a hardcore
hip-hop song working in Bel Air.

188
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,094
You got to keep it
in the 'hood, baby.

189
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:10,083
How am I sounding, baby?

190
00:10:10,173 --> 00:10:11,123
What?

191
00:10:11,841 --> 00:10:14,659
Like 2 million CDs, double platinum.

192
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:19,413
-Tyesha, this is officer...
-I'm Vic. Just call him Lemonhead.

193
00:10:19,503 --> 00:10:22,285
-Hey
-Hey. This is Rocco.

194
00:10:23,216 --> 00:10:26,790
It's a madhouse out there. How'd you
get past all the photographers?

195
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,036
We called ahead. Kern let us use
the security entrance.

196
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,361
Kern's not under arrest, is he?

197
00:10:33,451 --> 00:10:36,537
Unfortunately for those
tabloid hacks, no.

198
00:10:36,627 --> 00:10:39,677
-We just needed a statement.
-Which I gave.

199
00:10:39,767 --> 00:10:42,578
-And his help with this war.
-Well, it's not Kern.

200
00:10:43,067 --> 00:10:45,775
It's his boys trying to protect him.

201
00:10:45,865 --> 00:10:49,429
T-Bonz is just plain crazy.
Everybody knows that.

202
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,013
Don't worry about T-Bonz,
we'll deal with him.

203
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:57,845
I need you to give the word
to your crew. The war is over.

204
00:10:57,935 --> 00:11:00,147
Right after T-Bonz gives his word.

205
00:11:00,237 --> 00:11:02,552
I mean, T-Bonz's the one that
spilled blood on my turf.

206
00:11:03,982 --> 00:11:06,056
I'm nothing if not a man of peace.

207
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:12,088
Dutch?

208
00:11:13,286 --> 00:11:16,113
I'm running known associates
on the shooters Mackey brought in.

209
00:11:16,203 --> 00:11:18,016
We ever getting DSL around here?

210
00:11:18,106 --> 00:11:21,476
This is Ellie Ruiz.
I need you to help her out.

211
00:11:22,466 --> 00:11:25,298
-I'm working the Chez Club.
-Shockley can handle it.

212
00:11:25,388 --> 00:11:27,737
I need you to help find
Ellie's husband, Manuel.

213
00:11:33,591 --> 00:11:36,360
I can't believe we're doing this
for some fat cat's nanny.

214
00:11:37,138 --> 00:11:39,065
You'd be happier if
it was a mistress?

215
00:11:39,155 --> 00:11:40,635
It's abuse of power.

216
00:11:40,725 --> 00:11:43,569
You're upset
you got pulled off a big case.

217
00:11:43,659 --> 00:11:45,533
We're Aceveda's errand boys.

218
00:11:45,623 --> 00:11:48,147
Meanwhile, watch him cash in
on our hard work.

219
00:11:48,237 --> 00:11:50,964
So looking for a missing
migrant worker isn't important?

220
00:11:51,966 --> 00:11:54,312
-You do all the talking.
-Why me?

221
00:11:54,402 --> 00:11:55,559
You speak Spanish.

222
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:58,169
How can you be a cop in L.A.
For 12 years...

223
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,783
-...and not speak any Spanish?
-All my partners spoke Spanish.

224
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:03,794
-Besides, I know a phrase or two.
-Right.

225
00:12:06,013 --> 00:12:08,255
Yo no say means: I don't know.

226
00:12:08,345 --> 00:12:11,414
You hear it enough, it sinks in.
Missing hombre?

227
00:12:11,504 --> 00:12:13,294
Yeah.

228
00:12:17,239 --> 00:12:18,837
Manuel Ruiz?

229
00:12:22,239 --> 00:12:24,835
-There.
-Hey, hey!

230
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:28,802
Hey, hey. You, amigo. Amigo.

231
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:30,967
What's your name?

232
00:12:33,396 --> 00:12:35,541
Come on. You wouldn't be
sneaking away if you yo no say.

233
00:12:35,631 --> 00:12:37,721
Now, you know Manuel, don't you?

234
00:12:41,349 --> 00:12:42,522
Yes.

235
00:12:44,255 --> 00:12:45,998
-I don't believe it!
-What?

236
00:12:46,088 --> 00:12:47,214
Back up!

237
00:12:49,482 --> 00:12:50,796
Let's roll, man!

238
00:12:50,885 --> 00:12:53,562
Don't you make me break a sweat
trying to catch you!

239
00:12:56,552 --> 00:12:57,956
What the hell are you doing out?

240
00:12:59,505 --> 00:13:02,166
-Business.
-Rondell ordered you off the street.

241
00:13:02,256 --> 00:13:04,223
-No, not us.
-Run on home.

242
00:13:07,224 --> 00:13:08,713
What I'm gonna tell the boss?

243
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,215
I am the boss.

244
00:13:11,732 --> 00:13:16,015
-What I'm gonna tell Rondell?
-Don't worry. I'll tell him for you.

245
00:13:17,825 --> 00:13:20,714
-What's up, man?
-I saw two of your guys on the street.

246
00:13:20,804 --> 00:13:23,139
-Man, it's a free country.
-Nothing's free.

247
00:13:23,229 --> 00:13:25,186
I'm your landlord, Rondell.

248
00:13:25,276 --> 00:13:27,788
I let you use space that I own.

249
00:13:27,877 --> 00:13:31,447
Now, you can't follow by my rules,
then I'll find someone who can.

250
00:13:32,099 --> 00:13:34,322
-You got me?
-I got you.

251
00:13:36,974 --> 00:13:40,509
Now, smart-ass, who else
you got dealing and where?

252
00:13:40,927 --> 00:13:44,397
Manuel got picked for a job
on Tuesday, along with another man.

253
00:13:44,487 --> 00:13:47,484
-Eduardo Salcido.
-Salcido.

254
00:13:47,857 --> 00:13:50,160
Any connection between this Manuel
and Eduardo?

255
00:13:50,249 --> 00:13:53,525
-They were best friends in Mexico.
-Even snuck into the country together.

256
00:13:53,615 --> 00:13:55,953
Something happened
on that truck ride.

257
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:59,303
Ever since, Eduardo's been
telling people he's gonna kill Manuel.

258
00:13:59,393 --> 00:14:01,005
We know who hired the two of them?

259
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:05,135
-Truck logo said Jamison Contracting.
-Well, track it down.

260
00:14:05,225 --> 00:14:07,095
Find out if they ever
showed up for work.

261
00:14:08,732 --> 00:14:13,245
<i>All units, code 213,
intersection of Alvarado and Pine.</i>

262
00:14:13,334 --> 00:14:14,421
That's our corner.

263
00:14:14,542 --> 00:14:16,957
Goddamn it! He had to leave his guys
on the street!

264
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:19,264
Punch it!

265
00:14:37,448 --> 00:14:38,678
Police!

266
00:14:45,172 --> 00:14:46,438
Down there.

267
00:14:47,781 --> 00:14:49,513
Call EMT!

268
00:15:08,245 --> 00:15:09,535
Oh, no.

269
00:15:19,374 --> 00:15:21,302
The mayor knows the little boy, Vic.

270
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,385
You're shitting me.

271
00:15:23,475 --> 00:15:26,746
Belongs to his golf buddy's
second cousin or some such thing.

272
00:15:27,312 --> 00:15:28,781
Whatever. He's invested.

273
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:33,486
Any word on the kid's condition?

274
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,912
He's busted up pretty bad.

275
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:41,504
So I got nothing good
to tell the chief.

276
00:15:44,757 --> 00:15:46,815
How do I explain
these four dead thugs?

277
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:50,219
A war. Two rappers.
I know who they are.

278
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:53,352
Look, I'm handling it.

279
00:15:53,442 --> 00:15:56,003
I told the chief the Strike Team
would make a difference.

280
00:15:56,093 --> 00:15:59,596
That these things will stop.
I'm not seeing the difference.

281
00:15:59,686 --> 00:16:01,481
Temporary setback.

282
00:16:01,571 --> 00:16:05,358
The chief allows me to appropriate
funds for you based on results.

283
00:16:05,448 --> 00:16:08,280
If I can't defend you,
I can't afford you.

284
00:16:09,288 --> 00:16:10,347
Vic.

285
00:16:11,413 --> 00:16:13,163
-Thought you should know.
-Know what?

286
00:16:13,253 --> 00:16:14,495
Kid was DOA.

287
00:16:19,663 --> 00:16:21,126
I'm handling it.

288
00:16:26,647 --> 00:16:27,861
Knock, knock.

289
00:16:37,033 --> 00:16:38,092
Have a seat.

290
00:16:40,369 --> 00:16:42,967
-All right.
-Tough guy.

291
00:16:43,057 --> 00:16:44,958
This war ends right here
with a handshake.

292
00:16:45,048 --> 00:16:47,069
This fool stole my money
and my woman...

293
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:48,770
...and you expect me
to be a gentleman?

294
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,626
-What, Tyesha was your woman?
-Hell, yeah.

295
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:56,651
-We're not signing autographs, ladies.
-Okay.

296
00:16:59,837 --> 00:17:03,276
So basically, this is a dick wagging
contest over a piece of ass?

297
00:17:03,366 --> 00:17:05,188
This ain't about no piece of ass.

298
00:17:05,846 --> 00:17:08,098
It's about $2 million
that fool owe me.

299
00:17:08,188 --> 00:17:09,261
Two million dollars?

300
00:17:09,351 --> 00:17:12,128
-What 2 mil?
-Tyesha's money from the last CD.

301
00:17:12,218 --> 00:17:15,099
I broke her. Where my cut?

302
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:17,487
First up, calm down, money.

303
00:17:17,577 --> 00:17:19,771
I'm a businessman.
I can be fair.

304
00:17:19,861 --> 00:17:22,965
But $2 million,
you must be smoking crack.

305
00:17:23,055 --> 00:17:26,306
I'll give you a finder's fee.
Straighten you out.

306
00:17:26,396 --> 00:17:29,033
I'm doing your punk-ass a favour.
You owe me at least 10.

307
00:17:29,123 --> 00:17:31,778
You know what, T?
I'm gonna keep it real with you.

308
00:17:31,868 --> 00:17:36,351
Tyesha wasn't even selling records
till I hooked her up. And that's real.

309
00:17:36,441 --> 00:17:38,483
-Is that real?
-Hey, look, look, look.

310
00:17:38,573 --> 00:17:43,494
Your 10 lawyers can do battle with his
10 lawyers or we can settle this here.

311
00:17:43,584 --> 00:17:46,336
-I'm gonna get my money, bitch.
-Over my dead body.

312
00:17:46,426 --> 00:17:49,355
-Damn, that sound like a good idea.
-Shut up!

313
00:17:50,096 --> 00:17:51,320
Here's the deal.

314
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:54,872
Kern, you take tonight,
come up with a number.

315
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,779
You revise yours down a bit.
You bring me the numbers...

316
00:17:59,869 --> 00:18:01,738
...I'll decide what's fair.

317
00:18:02,479 --> 00:18:04,933
And who you supposed to be?
Judge Judy?

318
00:18:07,822 --> 00:18:12,415
I'm an impartial arbitrator with the
power to throw your asses in the can.

319
00:18:13,252 --> 00:18:16,922
Now, I'm calling a 24-hour cease-fire.

320
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,978
Your boys break it, I break you.

321
00:18:20,643 --> 00:18:22,026
Same goes for you.

322
00:18:22,947 --> 00:18:24,346
This war ends here.

323
00:18:29,736 --> 00:18:32,907
They come here of their own accord.
Nobody's coercing them.

324
00:18:32,997 --> 00:18:36,476
Family of five moving to another
country just to eat isn't coercion?

325
00:18:36,566 --> 00:18:41,299
You know why they come here?
Five words: Free market's rule of law.

326
00:18:41,389 --> 00:18:46,306
Those things create prosperity,
which creates jobs people want.

327
00:18:46,396 --> 00:18:49,632
Forty dollars for a full day's work
isn't prosperity.

328
00:18:49,722 --> 00:18:51,948
It's exploitation and
you wouldn't do it.

329
00:18:52,596 --> 00:18:54,459
-Excuse me.
-Can I help you?

330
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:57,438
Yeah. We're looking for a worker
named Eduardo?

331
00:18:58,033 --> 00:19:00,132
Throw a rock, you're bound to hit one.

332
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:02,481
Have you seen this guy?

333
00:19:03,869 --> 00:19:06,873
-Yeah. Jose.
-Manuel.

334
00:19:07,533 --> 00:19:11,881
Yeah. He showed up a few days ago,
worked for one day, got paid...

335
00:19:11,971 --> 00:19:13,722
...never saw him again.
What did he do?

336
00:19:13,812 --> 00:19:15,690
Have any idea what happened
after he left?

337
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,265
Don't know, don't care.

338
00:19:19,354 --> 00:19:21,486
Mind if we ask around for Eduardo?

339
00:19:21,576 --> 00:19:23,019
-Ask away.
-Thanks.

340
00:19:27,736 --> 00:19:29,093
Eduardo?

341
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:32,640
-Eduardo?
-Eduardo?

342
00:19:33,697 --> 00:19:35,263
Eduardo?!

343
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:41,000
It's not me. I think he's working
down over there.

344
00:19:44,843 --> 00:19:46,828
Hey! Stop!

345
00:19:46,918 --> 00:19:48,881
I said, stop! Hold it right there!

346
00:19:48,971 --> 00:19:50,976
-Hey, hey, hey!
-Hey, hey, hey!

347
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,730
Hey, San Salvador is that way!

348
00:20:06,522 --> 00:20:08,293
These the triggermen at the Chez Club?

349
00:20:08,655 --> 00:20:11,049
Some of them, I think. Happened fast.

350
00:20:12,116 --> 00:20:15,736
Rondell Robinson. You saw him
firing the gun in the club?

351
00:20:16,788 --> 00:20:17,859
Yeah.

352
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,483
-Beautiful.
-You know who he is?

353
00:20:23,788 --> 00:20:25,048
Yes, I do.

354
00:20:26,429 --> 00:20:28,149
Let's make this short and sweet.

355
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:31,105
Wherever you think I was, I wasn't.

356
00:20:31,374 --> 00:20:34,477
-Whatever you think I did, I didn't.
-That's your story?

357
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:35,812
Cover to cover.

358
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:37,665
I wouldn't plan on
selling movie rights.

359
00:20:37,755 --> 00:20:39,935
Guess I'll just have to settle
for starring in it.

360
00:20:41,304 --> 00:20:43,295
You're a murder suspect, Rondell.

361
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,057
I've got a witness saw you
pull the trigger at the Chez Club.

362
00:20:47,147 --> 00:20:49,560
Yeah, right. What witness?

363
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:53,917
A cop. And a jury's gonna love her.

364
00:20:58,335 --> 00:21:00,058
I got a phone call coming, right?

365
00:21:00,148 --> 00:21:02,648
You've only got one
thing left to deal.

366
00:21:02,738 --> 00:21:06,109
-That's who's giving you protection.
-I don't need no protection.

367
00:21:06,199 --> 00:21:08,699
Even if we can't tie you
to one of the dead bodies...

368
00:21:09,218 --> 00:21:11,692
...discharging a firearm
in a crowded club...

369
00:21:12,585 --> 00:21:13,900
Bye-bye, Rondell.

370
00:21:16,272 --> 00:21:19,172
So about that phone call.

371
00:21:19,624 --> 00:21:22,019
If you think that you
can sell drugs...

372
00:21:22,109 --> 00:21:25,346
...and commit murder in my district
because a cop's protecting you...

373
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,246
...you're dead wrong!

374
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:32,157
-I thought I told you to lay low.
-I was listening to Miles Davis...

375
00:21:32,247 --> 00:21:34,717
-...when this captain shows up.
-He get anything?

376
00:21:34,807 --> 00:21:37,610
No. I always keep my crib clean.

377
00:21:38,202 --> 00:21:41,687
But he's got a serious bug up his ass
about some cop protecting me.

378
00:21:42,499 --> 00:21:45,297
Just keep your mouth shut.
I'll handle Aceveda.

379
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:49,759
We have indications Manuel's
disappearance may involve foul play.

380
00:21:50,093 --> 00:21:54,017
-Really? You don't know for sure?
-We have a suspect.

381
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:58,294
He won't be able to elude us for long.
Once we capture him, we'll know more.

382
00:21:58,858 --> 00:22:02,311
Thank you for making this a priority.
You keep me apprised?

383
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:04,595
Of any developments.

384
00:22:08,499 --> 00:22:09,845
Is there something else?

385
00:22:12,897 --> 00:22:15,507
At the risk of having
an ulterior motive myself...

386
00:22:15,598 --> 00:22:16,651
Yes.

387
00:22:17,765 --> 00:22:21,589
I know police officers aren't accorded
the same respect in this community...

388
00:22:21,678 --> 00:22:24,762
-...as they were a decade ago.
-An unfortunate development.

389
00:22:24,852 --> 00:22:30,047
However, Latinos are a plurality
in Los Angeles...

390
00:22:30,137 --> 00:22:31,792
...and in this district.

391
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:36,108
There is going to be a seat opening up
on the City Council next year.

392
00:22:37,718 --> 00:22:40,093
It's traditionally been filled
with a black candidate.

393
00:22:41,186 --> 00:22:42,439
I think it's our time.

394
00:22:44,163 --> 00:22:45,317
I agree.

395
00:22:47,483 --> 00:22:48,826
With your backing...

396
00:22:49,991 --> 00:22:51,322
...I could win that seat.

397
00:22:52,397 --> 00:22:54,146
I could be of great use to you.

398
00:22:59,468 --> 00:23:01,675
I like you, David, quite a bit...

399
00:23:02,671 --> 00:23:05,352
...but I don't think I can sell a cop
to these voters.

400
00:23:05,442 --> 00:23:07,050
Not here, not now.

401
00:23:07,843 --> 00:23:11,064
Who knows? Maybe in time,
things will become much different.

402
00:23:11,444 --> 00:23:13,448
Until then, I'm sorry.

403
00:23:14,022 --> 00:23:16,982
What would you think of a man
who exposed corruption?

404
00:23:17,072 --> 00:23:19,545
Brought down dirty cops
from inside the department?

405
00:23:20,585 --> 00:23:23,493
I'd think he was committing
professional suicide.

406
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:25,624
But couldn't you sell
him to the voters?

407
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:30,710
Absolutely.

408
00:23:32,765 --> 00:23:36,172
-We got a call about a kidnapping.
-They took my boy, Thurman.

409
00:23:36,261 --> 00:23:37,522
When did you find out
he was kidnapped?

410
00:23:37,612 --> 00:23:38,879
Today.

411
00:23:38,969 --> 00:23:44,090
I got a ransom call asking
for $10,000. I don't have it!

412
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:47,650
-When did you last see Thurman?
-Three weeks.

413
00:23:48,491 --> 00:23:50,860
-How long has he been missing?
-Since last night.

414
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:53,203
-The last time you spoke?
-A month ago.

415
00:23:53,293 --> 00:23:56,232
Then how do you know he's only
been missing since last night?

416
00:23:56,322 --> 00:23:59,489
Cemetery called.
Somebody dug up his body.

417
00:24:00,632 --> 00:24:03,464
-Thurman's dead?
-Going on three weeks.

418
00:24:06,085 --> 00:24:07,914
Code four, cancel
that backup, please.

419
00:24:08,004 --> 00:24:09,213
<i>Roger that. Ten-four.</i>

420
00:24:10,663 --> 00:24:14,158
Ma'am, if the kidnapper calls back,
call us.

421
00:24:15,163 --> 00:24:16,715
You're not gonna help me?

422
00:24:17,827 --> 00:24:19,976
To be honest,
they'll push it to the bottom.

423
00:24:20,066 --> 00:24:23,992
Detectives, they have more important
things to do.

424
00:24:24,082 --> 00:24:28,690
But it's a crime, isn't it? Digging up
my son, holding it for ransom?

425
00:24:30,507 --> 00:24:34,522
-Yes, ma'am.
-So you two will help me, then, right?

426
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:38,730
Julien, you stay with her.
I'll ride solo.

427
00:24:39,702 --> 00:24:41,446
-Ma'am.
-Good.

428
00:24:47,288 --> 00:24:48,420
Hey.

429
00:24:49,546 --> 00:24:51,362
-I got a little problem.
-What's that?

430
00:24:51,452 --> 00:24:54,595
The guy you ID'd today,
he's a C.I. Of mine.

431
00:24:55,561 --> 00:24:57,066
-Really?
-Yeah.

432
00:24:57,156 --> 00:24:59,676
He's the guy who gave me
the shooters.

433
00:24:59,766 --> 00:25:02,866
He was firing in self-defence.
None of his shots killed anybody.

434
00:25:03,483 --> 00:25:07,362
I was hoping maybe your memory
could get a little fuzzy on this one.

435
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,081
I don't know, Vic.
Aceveda's all over this one.

436
00:25:11,171 --> 00:25:13,002
But if it ever goes to trial?

437
00:25:15,944 --> 00:25:17,092
I don't know.

438
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,077
Let me think about it.

439
00:25:23,499 --> 00:25:24,718
That's all I ask.

440
00:25:33,702 --> 00:25:37,569
-That's Thurman right there.
-I went to high school with him.

441
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,328
Did you know him?

442
00:25:39,418 --> 00:25:41,947
He and his friends
used to beat me up.

443
00:25:42,897 --> 00:25:45,026
It's okay.
He made me a better student.

444
00:25:45,116 --> 00:25:48,575
I hid out in the library until I grew
9 inches my junior year.

445
00:25:50,358 --> 00:25:52,446
He was killed robbing a liquor store.

446
00:25:53,421 --> 00:25:54,529
Thurman?

447
00:25:56,311 --> 00:26:01,384
He was a thief. He did drugs.
I was afraid to tell you.

448
00:26:01,944 --> 00:26:03,440
I would've helped you anyway.

449
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:06,677
I mean, maybe he didn't find
his path here on earth...

450
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:11,119
-...but he's with Jesus now.
-You believe that?

451
00:26:12,085 --> 00:26:13,220
I know that.

452
00:26:20,358 --> 00:26:22,901
-Hello?
<i>-You got the money ready?</i>

453
00:26:22,991 --> 00:26:24,841
Yes. Where's my son's body?

454
00:26:24,931 --> 00:26:27,399
<i>Bring the money to
the cemetery at 10.</i>

455
00:26:27,489 --> 00:26:28,588
What?

456
00:26:28,677 --> 00:26:31,518
<i>Bring the money to the cemetery
at 10:00 sharp.</i>

457
00:26:31,609 --> 00:26:34,228
-I can't understand you.
<i>-Bring the money to the cemetery...</i>

458
00:26:34,318 --> 00:26:37,645
<i>...at 10:00 sharp or Thurman's body
will be chopped to pieces...</i>

459
00:26:37,736 --> 00:26:41,583
<i>-...and you'll never see him again.</i>
-Henry! Is that you?

460
00:26:41,672 --> 00:26:42,842
Face front.

461
00:26:46,677 --> 00:26:49,129
-Did you hate her that much?
-No.

462
00:26:51,841 --> 00:26:53,102
She's all right.

463
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:56,172
We dated for a while, you know?

464
00:26:57,177 --> 00:26:59,985
-Then why did you do it?
-Why did I do it?

465
00:27:01,357 --> 00:27:02,670
Why did I do it?

466
00:27:03,623 --> 00:27:06,449
Knew she had
life insurance on her boy.

467
00:27:06,943 --> 00:27:09,886
I wanted to take my new lady
on one of them cruises.

468
00:27:10,716 --> 00:27:13,607
Dottie spent all the insurance money
on Thurman's funeral.

469
00:27:18,966 --> 00:27:20,443
Can you make it Thursday?

470
00:27:20,533 --> 00:27:22,519
How many problems
can a 5-year-old have?

471
00:27:22,609 --> 00:27:26,717
Enough that he's got an appointment
with a developmental paediatrician.

472
00:27:26,807 --> 00:27:31,462
-Matthew thinks he's a dog now.
-A German shepherd. So what?

473
00:27:31,552 --> 00:27:33,222
You're not here.
You don't see everything.

474
00:27:33,312 --> 00:27:34,326
See what?

475
00:27:34,416 --> 00:27:37,332
The problems.
Why do you have to fight me on this?

476
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,208
I'm not.

477
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:44,405
Okay, I'll try.
I'll try, okay?

478
00:27:47,193 --> 00:27:48,689
I'm really losing it.

479
00:27:49,607 --> 00:27:52,530
Why don't you go take a bath.
I'll put the kids to bed.

480
00:27:54,646 --> 00:27:55,818
Okay.

481
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,559
Good night. Thanks.

482
00:28:06,329 --> 00:28:08,086
-Get down.
-Hey. I'm a cop.

483
00:28:08,176 --> 00:28:10,265
Get down. Don't scream.

484
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,292
I said, I'm a cop!

485
00:28:12,641 --> 00:28:16,243
And I'm a cop killer.
But not tonight.

486
00:28:16,333 --> 00:28:18,539
Tonight's to show you
how we're gonna do it.

487
00:28:18,629 --> 00:28:19,946
What do you want?

488
00:28:20,036 --> 00:28:22,765
Forget what you saw at the Chez Club.
Understand?

489
00:28:23,907 --> 00:28:26,738
Yeah. I understand.

490
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:30,033
Come on.

491
00:28:39,201 --> 00:28:41,964
-Hey, hey, hey!
-You piece of shit!

492
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:46,384
-Something wrong, officer?
-You think you can get to me?

493
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:49,651
Girl, you better take
some kind of pill. Damn.

494
00:28:50,592 --> 00:28:52,629
You listen to me. I'm a cop.
You don't scare me.

495
00:28:52,719 --> 00:28:54,127
I don't know what
you're talking about.

496
00:28:56,701 --> 00:28:58,353
You do look scared, though.

497
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:07,066
Hey.

498
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:10,629
-I'll catch you outside, okay?
-Meet you out there.

499
00:29:12,449 --> 00:29:14,505
What was all that between you
and my C.I.?

500
00:29:24,767 --> 00:29:26,856
Did you tell him I was the one
that ID'd him?

501
00:29:26,946 --> 00:29:29,520
Of course not.
What the hell is going on?

502
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:32,436
He sent guys after me.
They put a gun to my head...

503
00:29:32,526 --> 00:29:34,613
...and told me to forget what I saw
at the Chez Club.

504
00:29:36,103 --> 00:29:39,415
-You should take the day off.
-No, maybe I should go after them.

505
00:29:39,505 --> 00:29:42,918
-Let me take care of this.
-Know what, I can take care of myself.

506
00:29:54,166 --> 00:29:58,745
-You went after a cop?
-Vic, I just scared her, man.

507
00:29:58,835 --> 00:30:00,405
Cops are off-limits.

508
00:30:04,924 --> 00:30:08,861
-Shooting at somebody shooting at me.
-I was taking care of it.

509
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:13,245
I didn't know.
I had to do something, man.

510
00:30:13,335 --> 00:30:16,316
Take your drug money
and bail yourself out.

511
00:30:16,666 --> 00:30:17,769
And then what?

512
00:30:18,384 --> 00:30:22,559
In the year and a half it'll take
to go to trial, I'll make it go away.

513
00:30:22,649 --> 00:30:24,518
Look, I can't take no chances, Vic.

514
00:30:24,608 --> 00:30:27,471
The biggest chance you could've taken
was to piss me off.

515
00:30:27,561 --> 00:30:29,875
And that's exactly what you did.

516
00:30:39,528 --> 00:30:41,976
-You see him?
-No.

517
00:30:42,066 --> 00:30:45,616
But I got you a Spanish-English
phrase book. My gift to you.

518
00:30:47,966 --> 00:30:50,584
Third day in a row you're checking
the Real Estate section.

519
00:30:50,673 --> 00:30:52,906
-What's the deal?
-None your.

520
00:30:52,996 --> 00:30:54,531
What's that, Spanish?

521
00:30:54,621 --> 00:30:57,002
English for "none of your business."

522
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:02,159
-We're partners. Share.
-Wanna share? Here's the Sports page.

523
00:31:02,249 --> 00:31:04,179
I'll find out. I'm a detective.

524
00:31:05,247 --> 00:31:06,405
There he is.

525
00:31:06,495 --> 00:31:07,964
Bingo, gringo.

526
00:31:13,697 --> 00:31:15,204
Eduardo Salcido?

527
00:31:34,205 --> 00:31:37,041
You and Manuel hopped on the same
truck. You went to work together?

528
00:31:39,533 --> 00:31:41,887
-Did you kill him after work ended?
-No.

529
00:31:43,541 --> 00:31:46,087
-So you killed him on the way to work?
-No.

530
00:31:46,854 --> 00:31:50,330
Where is he? How come his wife
hasn't heard from him?

531
00:31:51,182 --> 00:31:53,847
Spare me the Yo no sor. We know.

532
00:31:54,502 --> 00:31:56,866
-Know?
-About the grudge.

533
00:31:57,307 --> 00:31:59,986
You hated Manuel. You told
people you wanted to kill him.

534
00:32:00,076 --> 00:32:02,445
He my friend.

535
00:32:02,535 --> 00:32:07,304
-Used to be. Till the trip.
-What happened on that truck?

536
00:32:07,394 --> 00:32:08,677
What truck?

537
00:32:08,767 --> 00:32:11,844
The one that snuck you and Manuel
across the border.

538
00:32:11,934 --> 00:32:14,647
-What made you wanna kill him?
-Nothing.

539
00:32:14,737 --> 00:32:16,746
-You fight? He steal? What?
-Nothing.

540
00:32:16,836 --> 00:32:18,247
He did something.

541
00:32:19,283 --> 00:32:21,856
-Nothing happened.
-Was it personal? Did he hurt you?

542
00:32:21,946 --> 00:32:23,875
I'm not the one who killed Manuel.

543
00:32:24,721 --> 00:32:26,354
So Manuel is dead.

544
00:32:31,619 --> 00:32:32,819
<i>Stay here, Eduardo.</i>

545
00:32:44,849 --> 00:32:47,949
-You ask me, he was raped.
-What?

546
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:50,887
I know I sound like Dutch
with one of his theories.

547
00:32:50,977 --> 00:32:53,084
But my first few years on the job...

548
00:32:53,833 --> 00:32:57,617
...I practically lived in hospitals,
taking statements from rape victims.

549
00:32:57,707 --> 00:33:00,059
-He's got that look.
-The look?

550
00:33:00,149 --> 00:33:02,068
Nervousness, isolation.

551
00:33:02,158 --> 00:33:03,735
But it's mostly in the eyes.

552
00:33:04,989 --> 00:33:09,084
Raped in a truck sneaking into the
country? How is that possible?

553
00:33:09,174 --> 00:33:10,395
It's possible.

554
00:33:12,091 --> 00:33:14,142
What do you mean,
sounds like one of my theories?

555
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,474
What's with the getups?

556
00:33:22,489 --> 00:33:23,960
Avoiding cameras.

557
00:33:24,724 --> 00:33:27,777
-So, what's the problem?
-This is the goddamn problem.

558
00:33:30,497 --> 00:33:33,701
-He poisoned my baby.
-Threw some meat over the fence...

559
00:33:33,791 --> 00:33:35,616
...next thing, he's choking to death.

560
00:33:35,706 --> 00:33:37,920
-T-Bonz?
-Of course, it's T-Bonz.

561
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:40,733
-He's got to pay.
-She supposed to be in the studio...

562
00:33:40,823 --> 00:33:44,732
-...finishing her album right now.
-How can I work after this? Look.

563
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:48,941
It's game-over time for T-Bonz.
Be a man.

564
00:33:49,031 --> 00:33:50,043
I know.

565
00:33:50,864 --> 00:33:52,892
You know how much
this setback is costing me?

566
00:33:52,983 --> 00:33:56,027
-Get that off my table.
-The goddamn bastard has to pay.

567
00:33:56,116 --> 00:33:58,813
-That's T-Bonz breaking his truce.
-You gonna be a man...

568
00:33:58,903 --> 00:34:01,687
...or do I have to find someone
to do the job?

569
00:34:01,777 --> 00:34:03,099
Look.

570
00:34:03,189 --> 00:34:07,127
I told you, this is why we here.
I know what I got to do, all right?

571
00:34:07,217 --> 00:34:08,394
All right?

572
00:34:09,638 --> 00:34:12,754
-I just need you to help me do it.
-Do what?

573
00:34:12,844 --> 00:34:13,970
Do the deed.

574
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:20,350
T-Bonz. I know where he's holed up at.
But I can't get to him.

575
00:34:20,904 --> 00:34:25,296
-A man with a badge could, though.
-Why would I do something like that?

576
00:34:25,385 --> 00:34:29,815
Money. I'll make that rent Rondell
paying you look like chump change.

577
00:34:32,466 --> 00:34:34,321
Pay you double if I get to watch.

578
00:34:41,672 --> 00:34:43,362
You want this war to end, right?

579
00:34:45,961 --> 00:34:49,304
Then help me end it,
or more blood is gonna get spilled.

580
00:34:51,906 --> 00:34:53,281
Give me the address.

581
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,574
-Was Manuel the one who raped you?
-No rape.

582
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:59,478
-He hold you down?
-It not happen.

583
00:34:59,568 --> 00:35:02,349
-Catch you sleeping, you wake up...
-No.

584
00:35:02,439 --> 00:35:06,058
Somebody did that to me,
I'd smash their head in.

585
00:35:06,148 --> 00:35:08,730
I'd stab them, shoot them,
push him off a roof.

586
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,996
He raped you in that
truck, didn't he?

587
00:35:11,086 --> 00:35:12,602
We'd understand
if you killed him.

588
00:35:19,667 --> 00:35:21,238
I murder Manuel.

589
00:35:24,003 --> 00:35:25,142
You killed Manuel?

590
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:27,633
I murder Manuel.

591
00:35:29,417 --> 00:35:30,519
Good.

592
00:35:31,315 --> 00:35:32,335
Where?

593
00:35:33,112 --> 00:35:34,854
Working con el Senor Jamison.

594
00:35:34,944 --> 00:35:38,942
-We were on the roof and he fall.
-You pushed him?

595
00:35:39,032 --> 00:35:41,458
No. He...

596
00:35:42,104 --> 00:35:44,165
We were carrying...

597
00:35:45,417 --> 00:35:47,212
Air conditioning unit.

598
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,324
Look out, Manuel,
but he didn't hear him.

599
00:35:54,414 --> 00:35:56,041
He slipped and he fell.

600
00:35:56,534 --> 00:35:58,510
-He slipped and he fell.
-I murder him.

601
00:36:00,019 --> 00:36:01,767
That's not murder, Eduardo.

602
00:36:02,323 --> 00:36:04,544
That's not what Mr. Jamison say.

603
00:36:05,331 --> 00:36:07,870
What else did Senor Jamison say?

604
00:36:11,019 --> 00:36:12,899
This is private property!

605
00:36:12,988 --> 00:36:14,512
This is private property.

606
00:36:22,511 --> 00:36:26,868
-It was an accident.
-A man was accidentally buried here?

607
00:36:29,925 --> 00:36:32,308
I asked about Manuel's wife...

608
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:35,066
...his family, and no one seemed
to know.

609
00:36:35,156 --> 00:36:37,125
He had no papers, he was illegal.

610
00:36:37,215 --> 00:36:40,088
Burying a man on
your site is illegal.

611
00:36:40,178 --> 00:36:43,324
-I wanted to alert the authorities.
-Too much of a hassle?

612
00:36:43,414 --> 00:36:47,319
It would have shut down business
for weeks, put these guys out of work.

613
00:36:47,409 --> 00:36:50,277
-What would they have done then?
-Please.

614
00:36:50,367 --> 00:36:53,060
You told Eduardo
he was guilty of murder.

615
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:58,560
This is what you call
planting rice and beans.

616
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:01,063
Told you not to talk, asshole!

617
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,974
You have the right to remain silent.

618
00:37:09,064 --> 00:37:11,987
Anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law.

619
00:37:12,077 --> 00:37:13,895
You have the right to have...

620
00:37:13,985 --> 00:37:16,511
This ain't no police station.
What's going on?

621
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:20,338
Man, please, dog. Whatever you
thinking about doing, don't do it.

622
00:37:20,428 --> 00:37:23,051
T, what happened to that trash talker
I fell in love with?

623
00:37:23,141 --> 00:37:25,868
Come on, man, I'm begging you.
Come on, man.

624
00:37:25,958 --> 00:37:28,227
Come on, you dog killer, let's go.

625
00:37:28,317 --> 00:37:31,100
-Come on, man.
-You broke the truce. Time to pay.

626
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:34,141
I'll give you money, dude.
I'll hook you up, Mackey. I got money.

627
00:37:34,231 --> 00:37:38,065
I just need one phone call.
I'll give you whatever you need.

628
00:37:38,155 --> 00:37:41,770
-Let's end this, dude. It's over.
-Why you crying, T-Bonz?

629
00:37:42,394 --> 00:37:44,922
-What's he doing here?
-I paid for front row seats.

630
00:37:47,386 --> 00:37:49,572
Mackey, man, please, dog.

631
00:37:49,662 --> 00:37:50,908
Please.

632
00:37:51,604 --> 00:37:54,543
-Come on, Mackey, man.
-Get in.

633
00:37:54,633 --> 00:37:57,280
-You too, Kern.
-What?

634
00:37:57,370 --> 00:38:00,027
-The two of you guys are shacking up.
-Are you crazy?

635
00:38:00,117 --> 00:38:02,447
-He's definitely crazy.
-You two are so keen...

636
00:38:02,537 --> 00:38:06,027
...on killing each other, fine.
I'm cutting out the middle man.

637
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:08,832
-We had a deal, Vic.
-Hey, I'm never for sale.

638
00:38:08,922 --> 00:38:10,291
Now you know.

639
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:14,464
-I can respect that, but I'm saying...
-Shut up! Get inside!

640
00:38:14,554 --> 00:38:17,669
You two can't make peace,
I'll see one of you in the morning.

641
00:38:18,097 --> 00:38:20,639
-This how you gonna do it, man?
-Close it.

642
00:38:27,417 --> 00:38:29,186
I should've thought
of this yesterday.

643
00:38:29,815 --> 00:38:31,064
Yeah.

644
00:38:34,964 --> 00:38:38,704
-Hey, why you got to be such a bitch?
-Because of pricks like you, Freddie.

645
00:38:38,794 --> 00:38:43,661
-I got rights, you goddamn dyke.
-Hey. Save it for your new roommate.

646
00:38:44,761 --> 00:38:48,026
<i>-Yeah, I got a VIN number for you.</i>
-Rondell Robinson just made bail.

647
00:38:48,644 --> 00:38:52,273
-Yeah? Well, that's his right.
-Hundred grand in cash.

648
00:38:52,362 --> 00:38:55,834
Lot of money for a
kid from the ghetto.

649
00:38:56,487 --> 00:38:58,066
Maybe he's got a rich uncle.

650
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:04,029
-You all right?
-I'm fine.

651
00:39:04,526 --> 00:39:06,363
You just been a little
jacked-up today.

652
00:39:06,706 --> 00:39:08,143
Well, I'm fine.

653
00:39:08,233 --> 00:39:10,465
If you don't wanna talk about it,
that's cool.

654
00:39:10,555 --> 00:39:12,649
But I'm gonna say a prayer
for you tonight, though.

655
00:39:15,503 --> 00:39:16,677
Thanks.

656
00:39:20,034 --> 00:39:21,383
Heard you made bail.

657
00:39:22,448 --> 00:39:25,879
Hey. Your peaches are about
to go bad in there.

658
00:39:26,847 --> 00:39:30,509
Where's my stuff?
Where's my TV, man?

659
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:33,227
Donated to the Lynwild Boys' Club.

660
00:39:33,317 --> 00:39:35,497
You should've seen the looks
on these kids' faces.

661
00:39:35,587 --> 00:39:37,070
Man, it was like Christmas.

662
00:39:37,683 --> 00:39:40,092
My goddamn records, man?

663
00:39:43,823 --> 00:39:45,740
You went after a cop, Rondell.

664
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,903
You should thank me, dude.

665
00:39:50,993 --> 00:39:53,228
I talked him out of doing
a hell of a lot worse.

666
00:39:57,878 --> 00:40:02,183
The district attorney is content
that Manuel's death was accidental.

667
00:40:03,042 --> 00:40:04,349
I see.

668
00:40:05,026 --> 00:40:07,627
This Mr. Jamison,
what is his punishment?

669
00:40:07,717 --> 00:40:11,086
He'll plead guilty to tampering with
evidence, be fined and released.

670
00:40:11,854 --> 00:40:14,953
Senora Ruiz, I am truly sorry
about your husband.

671
00:40:19,136 --> 00:40:22,799
This man, Jamison, worked for
a large company, no?

672
00:40:23,815 --> 00:40:24,793
Yes.

673
00:40:26,206 --> 00:40:28,163
Then I can sue them for much money?

674
00:40:33,361 --> 00:40:34,831
Thanks again, David.

675
00:40:35,806 --> 00:40:37,149
I'm glad I could help.

676
00:40:38,134 --> 00:40:40,455
I have given some thought
to your proposal.

677
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:43,493
-And?
-I'm intrigued.

678
00:40:44,564 --> 00:40:47,489
I have a few months before I decide
who I'm going to back.

679
00:40:48,892 --> 00:40:50,218
Show me what you can do.

680
00:40:54,798 --> 00:40:58,070
-They no think I murder Manuel?
-No.

681
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,282
Muchas gracias, Detective Dutch.

682
00:41:01,962 --> 00:41:04,752
Tell me something. You hated Manuel.

683
00:41:04,842 --> 00:41:08,955
You made threats against his life. Why
go on the same job with him that day?

684
00:41:09,423 --> 00:41:12,424
When the truck come,
they pick Manuel, they pick me.

685
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,038
I have to work.

686
00:41:15,486 --> 00:41:18,316
So, what's next, Eduardo?

687
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:22,004
I don't know.

688
00:41:23,329 --> 00:41:27,702
The reason I ask is, I've got this
retaining wall that's crumbling...

689
00:41:33,918 --> 00:41:35,087
Looking for me?

690
00:41:35,848 --> 00:41:38,217
Heard you were
kicking some ass today.

691
00:41:39,691 --> 00:41:41,077
No more than usual.

692
00:41:44,465 --> 00:41:45,679
Do you trust me?

693
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:51,023
-What?
-With your life. Do you trust me?

694
00:41:54,801 --> 00:41:55,898
Yeah.

695
00:41:56,683 --> 00:41:58,417
Well, then you believe me
when I tell you...

696
00:41:59,176 --> 00:42:01,263
...you don't have to look over your
shoulder no more.

697
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:02,911
I took care of it.

698
00:42:04,848 --> 00:42:07,144
-You took care of it?
-You got no more problems.

699
00:42:14,892 --> 00:42:15,937
Christ. I don't know what...

700
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:21,801
Hello?

701
00:42:23,647 --> 00:42:24,716
What?

702
00:42:25,686 --> 00:42:26,639
Where?

703
00:42:28,147 --> 00:42:30,870
All right, I'll be right there.
I gotta run.

704
00:42:41,403 --> 00:42:43,776
<i>Doctor Shapiro to Cardiology.</i>

705
00:42:45,246 --> 00:42:48,235
Nurse. Hi. I'm look...
I got it.

706
00:42:49,512 --> 00:42:51,826
Okay. Where's Megan?

707
00:42:51,916 --> 00:42:53,819
She's getting x-rays.
Mom's with her.

708
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:55,459
He didn't mean it.

709
00:42:55,549 --> 00:42:59,409
A 5-year-old does not bite his
18-month-old sister on the face...

710
00:42:59,499 --> 00:43:01,462
...and make her fall on her head.

711
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:03,430
All right, go be with Megan.

712
00:43:17,411 --> 00:43:18,686
It's gonna be okay.

713
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:21,019
Your sister's gonna be all right.

714
00:43:37,061 --> 00:43:38,159
I don't hear nothing.

715
00:43:38,249 --> 00:43:40,905
Assholes like these don't
wake up before noon.

716
00:43:48,548 --> 00:43:49,729
T-Bonz!

717
00:43:50,923 --> 00:43:52,631
Nobody else coming out of there.

718
00:43:55,431 --> 00:43:56,949
Told you he was a bitch.

719
00:43:59,024 --> 00:44:01,657
I'll have my cleanup crew
come clean that mess, man.

720
00:44:05,571 --> 00:44:06,671
Shit.

721
00:44:13,723 --> 00:44:15,287
-Give me that.
-Fine.

722
00:44:15,855 --> 00:44:17,191
I'll take care of this.

723
00:44:35,071 --> 00:44:36,389
You hungry?

724
00:44:38,165 --> 00:44:39,857
Goddamn starved.
