1
00:00:01,636 --> 00:00:04,539
Read the prepared statement
and then ask for questions.

2
00:00:04,539 --> 00:00:07,209
<i>And expect Hanratty to ask
</i>about the Wilkey Gardens bust.

3
00:00:07,209 --> 00:00:08,543
<i>Reflect, but don't deny.</i>

4
00:00:08,543 --> 00:00:10,278
<i>Right. You got your notes?</i>

5
00:00:10,278 --> 00:00:11,680
Don't need 'em.

6
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,348
<i>Thanks for making the trip.</i>

7
00:00:13,348 --> 00:00:15,951
And now here's Captain David Aceveda.

8
00:00:16,952 --> 00:00:18,153
Thank you, Wanda.

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,856
<i>The Farmington district
</i>of Los Angeles...

10
00:00:20,856 --> 00:00:23,425
<i>...which I've been commanding
</i>for the last four months...

11
00:00:23,425 --> 00:00:25,660
<i>...has traditionally been
</i>one of the most dangerous,...

12
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,462
<i>...crime-ridden areas of the city.</i>

13
00:00:27,462 --> 00:00:31,066
Some reporters have gone so far as
to label Farmington a war zone.

14
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:37,472
Yeah, it's over at the corner!

15
00:00:52,554 --> 00:00:55,991
I'm proud to announce that
murders, rapes, armed robberies...

16
00:00:55,991 --> 00:00:59,194
...and many other violent crimes
have decreased dramatically here...

17
00:00:59,194 --> 00:01:00,328
...in the last six months.

18
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,202
Under my direction,
law enforcement officers...

19
00:01:07,202 --> 00:01:09,671
...now participate
in neighborhood outreach programs.

20
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:24,152
Already, the effect
is being felt by local families.

21
00:01:24,152 --> 00:01:26,388
Mothers feel safer
as they shop for groceries.

22
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,528
Too late, G-man.

23
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,565
With the continued support of...

24
00:01:36,565 --> 00:01:39,167
...community leaders and
ordinary citizens...

25
00:01:39,167 --> 00:01:43,872
...we can make the Farmington district
a safer home or all of us.

26
00:01:45,307 --> 00:01:46,508
Mother...

27
00:01:48,677 --> 00:01:50,512
That's for running, asshole.

28
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,614
Get up.

29
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,885
What the hell, man?

30
00:02:00,322 --> 00:02:02,057
Look at that, Booty.

31
00:02:02,057 --> 00:02:05,160
Looks like you got some kind
of third nad going down there.

32
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,696
Let me get that for ya.
No, wait!

33
00:02:07,696 --> 00:02:08,730
Shit!

34
00:02:09,931 --> 00:02:11,533
I got an evidence bag
somewhere.

35
00:02:11,533 --> 00:02:14,169
No, that's okay. I got it.
All right.

36
00:02:17,005 --> 00:02:18,473
Come on.

37
00:02:20,675 --> 00:02:21,943
Buenos dias.

38
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:24,512
Any questions?

39
00:02:35,858 --> 00:02:37,259
Christ!

40
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:39,495
You do not see a pair
like that every day.

41
00:02:39,495 --> 00:02:40,929
It's called rigor.

42
00:02:40,929 --> 00:02:43,665
Rigor or no rigor,
that's a serious rack.

43
00:02:43,665 --> 00:02:45,434
You wanna give 'em a squeeze?

44
00:02:45,434 --> 00:02:47,736
How much time we got
before the M.E. shows up?

45
00:02:47,736 --> 00:02:50,472
Victim's sister is outside.
Wants to know what happened.

46
00:02:50,472 --> 00:02:53,075
Dutch is in charge
of all potential criers.

47
00:02:53,075 --> 00:02:54,176
Thanks.

48
00:02:54,576 --> 00:02:55,811
Are you the first one here?

49
00:02:55,811 --> 00:02:57,779
Yeah. Me and Julien got the call.

50
00:02:57,779 --> 00:03:00,549
Last few weeks,
dead bodies seem to follow you around.

51
00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:02,784
Yeah, I'm a real fun-time gal.

52
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,219
Any notions on this one?

53
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:05,821
Nature of the wounds,
we're looking at...

54
00:03:05,821 --> 00:03:07,723
...an inexperienced
under-achiever type.

55
00:03:07,723 --> 00:03:09,958
Covered genitals,
feels shame for what he did.

56
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:12,394
Family member, boyfriend.
This one will break easy.

57
00:03:12,394 --> 00:03:16,665
Don't! Let me go!
Goddamn it! Get outta my way!

58
00:03:16,665 --> 00:03:18,901
Miss, I need you to calm down.

59
00:03:18,901 --> 00:03:20,702
-Who are you?
-Detective Wagenbach.

60
00:03:20,702 --> 00:03:22,304
Is she dead?

61
00:03:22,304 --> 00:03:24,706
There's a young woman inside.
We haven't identified her yet.

62
00:03:24,706 --> 00:03:26,341
This is my sister's place.

63
00:03:26,341 --> 00:03:28,510
Like I said, we don't
know who she is yet.

64
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,145
Long blonde hair, pretty.

65
00:03:31,446 --> 00:03:34,016
That sounds like her. I'm sorry.

66
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:44,526
Ma'am.

67
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:49,798
Ma'am.

68
00:03:54,203 --> 00:03:55,737
Where's Jenny?

69
00:03:56,305 --> 00:03:57,606
Jenny?

70
00:03:57,606 --> 00:03:59,541
Nancy's little girl. Where is she?

71
00:04:01,176 --> 00:04:02,277
Come with me.

72
00:04:10,586 --> 00:04:11,853
Guess what's missing?

73
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:18,493
-Shit, son.
-I know.

74
00:04:18,493 --> 00:04:20,128
It just got interesting.

75
00:04:29,171 --> 00:04:30,372
Hey, Sarge.

76
00:04:31,707 --> 00:04:32,708
Thanks.

77
00:04:34,042 --> 00:04:36,245
I gotta hit the head.
I'll see you in the clubhouse.

78
00:04:38,981 --> 00:04:40,582
-Hey, doll.
-Just in time.

79
00:04:40,582 --> 00:04:42,751
I've got some reporters here.
You feel like talking?

80
00:04:42,751 --> 00:04:43,919
Nah.

81
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,555
You sure? Gilroy and the chief
will push this story hard.

82
00:04:46,555 --> 00:04:48,023
Your team deserves a lot of credit.

83
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:51,960
-Let the poster boy do his thing.
-Talk to you.

84
00:04:54,196 --> 00:04:56,365
Peterson, the john's
still not working?

85
00:04:56,365 --> 00:04:57,666
Plumber must have gotten lost.

86
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,034
If this city wants to thank us...

87
00:04:59,034 --> 00:05:01,436
...for a job well done,
how's about making sure...

88
00:05:01,436 --> 00:05:04,673
...we don't all have to all cram
into the same goddamn stall?

89
00:05:08,944 --> 00:05:10,012
Vic, can I see you?

90
00:05:10,012 --> 00:05:12,114
-Give me a sec.
-I need you now.

91
00:05:12,114 --> 00:05:13,882
I'm taking a piss.

92
00:05:13,882 --> 00:05:15,884
Provided a spot
in the ladies' room opens up.

93
00:05:15,884 --> 00:05:17,419
I got my fingers crossed.

94
00:05:18,053 --> 00:05:19,054
Now.

95
00:05:23,091 --> 00:05:24,459
Aye, aye, Captain.

96
00:05:25,761 --> 00:05:28,563
Great. Have fun in here, bro.

97
00:05:30,065 --> 00:05:32,034
You remember Miguel Esteana.

98
00:05:32,367 --> 00:05:33,468
Sure.

99
00:05:33,902 --> 00:05:36,972
Miguel's a piece-of-shit drug dealer
with the 25th Street Coronas.

100
00:05:36,972 --> 00:05:40,108
This is the kind of attitude
you foster under your command?

101
00:05:40,108 --> 00:05:42,711
-Mr. Esteana's attorney, Jos?Garcia...
-I know Jos?

102
00:05:42,711 --> 00:05:44,946
He represents a bunch
of piece-of-shit drug dealers.

103
00:05:44,946 --> 00:05:47,683
What I do is ensure my clients' rights
aren't violated...

104
00:05:47,683 --> 00:05:49,217
...by thugs like you.

105
00:05:49,217 --> 00:05:52,854
Mr. Esteana claims you used
excessive force during his arrest.

106
00:05:52,854 --> 00:05:53,989
Really?

107
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,558
Is that what you claim, Miguel?

108
00:05:58,126 --> 00:06:00,696
Yeah, that's some hickey.
Boyfriend give you that?

109
00:06:00,696 --> 00:06:03,298
No, you did it with some pliers.

110
00:06:04,366 --> 00:06:06,101
I don't recall any pliers.

111
00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:10,138
I remember the eight dime bags
of pure H we nabbed you with.

112
00:06:10,138 --> 00:06:13,175
The search, we'll be contesting
with Judge McAllister.

113
00:06:13,175 --> 00:06:16,978
I'm sorry. I'm drawing a blank
on this whole pliers thing.

114
00:06:16,978 --> 00:06:20,515
Feel free to ask my guys, but I doubt
they remember it that way either.

115
00:06:20,515 --> 00:06:22,050
-You're a disgrace.
-That's funny.

116
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,785
I don't recall signing
up for ethics class...

117
00:06:23,785 --> 00:06:25,754
...from a scumbag drug lawyer.

118
00:06:28,156 --> 00:06:31,093
Is that all
or can I go take that piss?

119
00:06:32,728 --> 00:06:35,497
-So Miguel is lying?
-Anything to stay out of jail.

120
00:06:35,497 --> 00:06:37,666
Fourth complaint since I came here.

121
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:39,401
Lucky for me you don't believe 'em.

122
00:06:40,802 --> 00:06:42,704
Keep smiling for the cameras.

123
00:06:42,704 --> 00:06:45,173
See what you can do
about getting the men's john fixed.

124
00:06:51,413 --> 00:06:53,582
I stopped listening to
you five minutes ago.

125
00:06:53,582 --> 00:06:55,550
I'm just saying our
un-sub's disorganized...

126
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,552
...probably a record and
no violent history.

127
00:06:57,552 --> 00:07:00,122
-"Un-sub"?
-Unidentified subject.

128
00:07:00,122 --> 00:07:01,823
You mean the killer.

129
00:07:01,823 --> 00:07:02,958
Yeah.

130
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:05,093
Then just say that! Christ!

131
00:07:06,928 --> 00:07:08,697
You think Danny would go out with me?

132
00:07:08,697 --> 00:07:09,965
Danny?

133
00:07:10,632 --> 00:07:14,770
A study says over 40 percent of female
police meet their spouses on the job.

134
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,671
You wanna date again, fine.

135
00:07:16,671 --> 00:07:18,573
But why chase after a uni-cop
in our own station?

136
00:07:18,573 --> 00:07:20,041
That's just lazy, son.

137
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:22,444
Get her out of uniform,
I'll bet she's a knockout.

138
00:07:22,444 --> 00:07:26,281
Sign up for dance classes.
Take out an ad. Join a book club.

139
00:07:26,281 --> 00:07:29,885
For God's sake, show some imagination.
No wonder your wife left you.

140
00:07:30,452 --> 00:07:32,621
Lucy had intimacy
issues unrelated to me.

141
00:07:32,621 --> 00:07:34,322
Right, unrelated to you.

142
00:07:34,322 --> 00:07:36,558
-Buzzer, Sarge!
<i>-Yeah!</i>

143
00:07:37,025 --> 00:07:40,629
You're such an expert,
how come both your husbands left you?

144
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:43,698
It sure as hell
wasn't for a lack of imagination.

145
00:07:43,698 --> 00:07:44,966
You got a missing kid?

146
00:07:44,966 --> 00:07:48,203
Jenny Reeborg, 8 years old.
We found her mother stabbed to death.

147
00:07:48,203 --> 00:07:50,939
-Any leads?
-We're following some things up.

148
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:52,474
What have you got so far?

149
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:54,643
Her father's a crackhead.

150
00:07:54,643 --> 00:07:55,877
Personal nature of the crime,...

151
00:07:55,877 --> 00:07:58,113
...his daughter missing,
he's gonna be our guy.

152
00:07:58,113 --> 00:08:00,182
Also, a neighbor saw
Ponyboy Harris banging...

153
00:08:00,182 --> 00:08:01,883
...on the dead lady's
door yesterday.

154
00:08:01,883 --> 00:08:03,318
Who's Ponyboy Harris?

155
00:08:03,318 --> 00:08:05,821
He's a local fence. Bit of a fancy.

156
00:08:05,821 --> 00:08:08,390
Collared him three or
four times personally.

157
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:11,226
You guys need anything
run down, just ask.

158
00:08:11,226 --> 00:08:12,661
I wanna help.

159
00:08:12,661 --> 00:08:14,396
Thanks, Captain.

160
00:08:14,396 --> 00:08:16,498
Since when does he
get his hands dirty?

161
00:08:17,566 --> 00:08:19,201
Can't blame a guy for trying.

162
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:24,005
-Danny, hey!
-Hey.

163
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,208
How's the coffee?

164
00:08:26,908 --> 00:08:29,144
Usual police issue?

165
00:08:29,144 --> 00:08:31,546
-Pretty much.
-There's a shock.

166
00:08:33,515 --> 00:08:36,184
Listen, I don't...

167
00:08:36,184 --> 00:08:37,853
I don't know what your plans are...

168
00:08:37,853 --> 00:08:40,622
Lookie here, Shane,
it's the ladykiller!

169
00:08:40,622 --> 00:08:42,123
Dutch boy, what's this I hear...

170
00:08:42,123 --> 00:08:44,960
...about some dead girl's sister
blowing you at the crime scene?

171
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,462
Dutch man! Going to town!

172
00:08:47,462 --> 00:08:49,798
-You guys are sick.
-Us?

173
00:08:49,798 --> 00:08:51,266
You're the one getting
your pipe smoked...

174
00:08:51,266 --> 00:08:53,935
...by a grieving relative
right by the body.

175
00:08:54,402 --> 00:08:56,571
She was upset. I was comforting her.

176
00:08:56,571 --> 00:08:59,841
You don't have to tell me
about the different stages of grief.

177
00:08:59,841 --> 00:09:02,777
There's denial, anger,
sucking you off.

178
00:09:03,912 --> 00:09:05,914
If you can think of anything else,...

179
00:09:05,914 --> 00:09:08,750
...you just call 911 and ask for Det.
Blow Me.

180
00:09:10,485 --> 00:09:13,255
-Excuse me.
-"Detective Blow Me."

181
00:09:13,255 --> 00:09:16,358
Dutch, what?
Come on, don't be so sensitive.

182
00:09:16,358 --> 00:09:17,559
That was real classy.

183
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:20,295
Come on. Dutch thinks he's
a notch above the rest of us.

184
00:09:20,295 --> 00:09:23,498
-I'm bringing him back down to earth.
-That's big of you.

185
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,936
I gotta go run an errand,
but I was thinking...

186
00:09:27,936 --> 00:09:29,871
...you and I should
get a drink tonight.

187
00:09:29,871 --> 00:09:31,273
Is your wife coming?

188
00:09:31,907 --> 00:09:34,876
-Damn, she can't make it.
-Damn, neither can I.

189
00:09:34,876 --> 00:09:37,145
Since when did you get morals?

190
00:09:37,612 --> 00:09:39,948
Always had them.
Sometimes I just lose track.

191
00:09:39,948 --> 00:09:41,016
Really?

192
00:09:41,917 --> 00:09:44,252
How's about you
lose track of them tonight?

193
00:09:45,654 --> 00:09:47,222
Yeah, I don't think so.

194
00:09:48,123 --> 00:09:50,225
You want me to back off?

195
00:09:50,225 --> 00:09:52,494
All you gotta do is tell
me it wasn't great.

196
00:09:54,829 --> 00:09:55,897
You ready?

197
00:09:59,768 --> 00:10:00,902
Yeah.

198
00:10:33,001 --> 00:10:35,437
-Back to the barn.
-Who was that?

199
00:10:35,437 --> 00:10:36,805
Guy I know.

200
00:11:02,263 --> 00:11:03,665
I went through the books.

201
00:11:03,665 --> 00:11:06,067
The guy I saw Mackey talking to
is a drug dealer named...

202
00:11:06,067 --> 00:11:07,969
Named Rondell Robinson.

203
00:11:07,969 --> 00:11:09,237
Right.

204
00:11:09,237 --> 00:11:11,406
You suggesting
Mackey's working for a dealer?

205
00:11:11,406 --> 00:11:13,441
I'm suggesting
he's working for Mackey.

206
00:11:13,441 --> 00:11:15,410
-What?
-Robinson's main competition...

207
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,078
...is a guy named Two-Time.

208
00:11:17,078 --> 00:11:19,080
Mackey's been taking
out all his dealers...

209
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,982
...giving Robinson a monopoly.

210
00:11:20,982 --> 00:11:23,752
A monopoly means
profits go up for Robinson...

211
00:11:23,752 --> 00:11:26,054
...street violence
goes down for Mackey.

212
00:11:26,054 --> 00:11:28,089
And I want you to help me prove it.

213
00:11:35,363 --> 00:11:36,431
Okay.

214
00:11:41,503 --> 00:11:44,339
-Who's he?
-Moses Hernandez.

215
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:45,940
We went to SC together.

216
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,375
He's in Justice.

217
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,778
Moses, this is Terry.

218
00:11:49,778 --> 00:11:50,679
It's good to meet you.

219
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:53,181
I didn't agree to be a witness
in a federal case.

220
00:11:53,181 --> 00:11:56,584
The friends Mackey has,
federal's the only way we'll nail him.

221
00:11:56,584 --> 00:11:59,054
I go outside the department
and rat out another cop,...

222
00:11:59,054 --> 00:12:00,722
...my life's not worth crap in LA.

223
00:12:01,723 --> 00:12:02,857
He's right.

224
00:12:03,658 --> 00:12:06,394
It's too dangerous.
He can't pull it off.

225
00:12:06,394 --> 00:12:08,930
-I didn't say I that.
-I know.

226
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:11,566
I just meant you need assurances
of an upside to all this.

227
00:12:11,566 --> 00:12:13,768
-Such as?
-Such as...

228
00:12:13,768 --> 00:12:16,938
...a guarantee of a job in Justice
when it's all over.

229
00:12:16,938 --> 00:12:20,542
You think I want to be an errand boy
in some Alaskan outpost?

230
00:12:20,542 --> 00:12:21,876
You pick the city then.

231
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:26,114
Okay. Try the home office in DC.

232
00:12:26,114 --> 00:12:28,216
-I'm gonna need moving expenses.
-Sure.

233
00:12:28,216 --> 00:12:31,486
Plus a car and a nice
big fruit basket.

234
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,556
I'm giving up my life,
you gotta give me something back.

235
00:12:34,556 --> 00:12:35,590
I can make it happen.

236
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:38,026
Okay, no offense,
I'd like it in writing today.

237
00:12:38,026 --> 00:12:41,696
Let's be clear here, Terry.
We're talking about making a case...

238
00:12:41,696 --> 00:12:44,099
...that puts Mackey
behind bars for a long time.

239
00:12:44,099 --> 00:12:46,034
Because if we only wound him...

240
00:12:46,034 --> 00:12:48,603
...his friends upstairs
will crush both of us.

241
00:12:48,603 --> 00:12:50,371
Yeah, I know what I have to do.

242
00:12:50,371 --> 00:12:51,539
Good.

243
00:12:53,141 --> 00:12:55,710
I know what I'm getting out of this.

244
00:12:56,578 --> 00:12:58,613
What are you getting out of this?

245
00:12:58,613 --> 00:13:00,882
I just want a dirty
cop off the street.

246
00:13:02,217 --> 00:13:03,752
You wanna be mayor someday,...

247
00:13:03,752 --> 00:13:06,287
...better learn how to lie a hell
of a lot better than that.

248
00:13:17,465 --> 00:13:19,000
Ponyboy!

249
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,268
Goddamn!

250
00:13:20,268 --> 00:13:21,903
Claudette! Look what you made me do.

251
00:13:21,903 --> 00:13:23,204
What is all this stuff?

252
00:13:23,204 --> 00:13:27,509
That? That's just a big bunch of VCRs
I stole from Circuit City.

253
00:13:30,712 --> 00:13:32,447
I don't know anything about that girl.

254
00:13:32,447 --> 00:13:34,916
All right? Be real.
You know me. Come on.

255
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:37,352
Why were you
at Nancy Reeborg's house yesterday?

256
00:13:37,352 --> 00:13:39,521
I was looking for her old man, Lonnie.

257
00:13:39,521 --> 00:13:41,356
Lonnie's not living there anymore.

258
00:13:41,356 --> 00:13:43,825
-I know that.
-You ever find Lonnie?

259
00:13:44,292 --> 00:13:45,794
You know Bunny Jenkins?

260
00:13:45,794 --> 00:13:49,497
Said he was using at this crack house
run by a guy named Monty.

261
00:13:49,497 --> 00:13:53,468
I was gonna go there after I unloaded
the VCRs, which is when you showed up.

262
00:13:53,468 --> 00:13:55,637
-Okay. Good.
-Good?

263
00:13:55,637 --> 00:14:00,975
Now let's work out this Circuit
City misunderstanding. Claudette?

264
00:14:07,482 --> 00:14:09,284
-Vic?
-Yeah, what?

265
00:14:09,284 --> 00:14:11,619
You know a crack house run
by some guy named Monty?

266
00:14:11,619 --> 00:14:15,190
Yeah, sure. It's on Crescent,
just west of 7th. Why?

267
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,724
I gotta pick up a smokehound there.

268
00:14:16,724 --> 00:14:20,562
No, no can do. Monty gives me
dirt, I give him safe passage.

269
00:14:20,562 --> 00:14:22,964
This guy might have
something to do with the missing girl.

270
00:14:25,967 --> 00:14:27,569
All right, I'll go get him myself.

271
00:14:27,569 --> 00:14:29,537
-The cards suck anyways.
-Come on, Vic.

272
00:14:29,537 --> 00:14:30,905
No, I'm gonna go.

273
00:14:39,013 --> 00:14:40,114
Shut up!

274
00:14:42,984 --> 00:14:44,586
-Vic.
-Open.

275
00:14:46,521 --> 00:14:48,156
Shut up!

276
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,398
Lonnie Reeborg. He here?

277
00:14:57,398 --> 00:14:59,734
-In there. Is there a problem?
-Show me.

278
00:15:05,006 --> 00:15:08,943
Okay, Lonnie. Let's go.
Come on. Rise and shine.

279
00:15:08,943 --> 00:15:11,112
-You stop that.
-Let's go!

280
00:15:14,482 --> 00:15:15,583
What'd he do?

281
00:15:17,018 --> 00:15:19,354
-You got kids here.
-It's Teacher Institute Day.

282
00:15:19,354 --> 00:15:21,456
-Where's their mom?
-Buying supplies.

283
00:15:21,456 --> 00:15:24,392
Jesus Christ, Monty.
You can't have kids around this place.

284
00:15:24,392 --> 00:15:27,262
-What am I supposed to do?
-Stick them in a back room.

285
00:15:27,262 --> 00:15:29,831
-Rent The Lion King.
-Someone stole the TV.

286
00:15:29,831 --> 00:15:32,099
Then buy them some crayons
for Christ's sake!

287
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:33,902
Just keep them away from this shit.

288
00:15:37,372 --> 00:15:41,242
Think back, Lonnie.
You killed your wife last night.

289
00:15:41,242 --> 00:15:43,244
Why do you keep saying that?

290
00:15:43,244 --> 00:15:45,280
'Cause that's the God's truth, son.

291
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,515
-You can't lie to God.
-Or the crime lab.

292
00:15:47,515 --> 00:15:49,317
Her blood's all over your shirt.

293
00:15:49,317 --> 00:15:51,019
<i>I don't even got a shirt.</i>

294
00:15:51,419 --> 00:15:54,522
<i>-It's evidence now.
</i>-Where's Jenny?

295
00:15:54,522 --> 00:15:56,991
<i>-Jenny?
</i>-Where is your daughter?

296
00:15:56,991 --> 00:15:58,493
<i>I went there to pick her up.</i>

297
00:15:58,493 --> 00:16:01,162
-Where is she?
-I needed her.

298
00:16:01,963 --> 00:16:04,565
You remember killing Nancy?

299
00:16:05,533 --> 00:16:07,068
You remember the knife?

300
00:16:07,635 --> 00:16:09,437
I just went there for Jenny.

301
00:16:11,172 --> 00:16:13,975
Think, Lonnie.
You went over there...

302
00:16:13,975 --> 00:16:16,277
-I said that...
-To get Jenny.

303
00:16:16,277 --> 00:16:19,614
-She's half mine.
-Nancy made you angry.

304
00:16:19,614 --> 00:16:21,282
She wouldn't let me take Jenny.

305
00:16:21,282 --> 00:16:23,618
You didn't mean to kill her,
she made you do it.

306
00:16:24,285 --> 00:16:26,020
I didn't kill no one.

307
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,222
Think, Lonnie.
What did you do to Nancy?

308
00:16:30,058 --> 00:16:31,626
I don't feel good.

309
00:16:31,626 --> 00:16:33,962
<i>Concentrate!
</i>What happened to Nancy?

310
00:16:33,962 --> 00:16:37,265
<i>-I don't...
</i>-You gotta keep trying.

311
00:16:37,265 --> 00:16:38,533
<i>I'm trying.</i>

312
00:16:41,836 --> 00:16:43,805
I went there to get Jenny.

313
00:16:44,472 --> 00:16:45,473
Yeah.

314
00:16:46,841 --> 00:16:48,643
Nancy tried to stop me.

315
00:16:50,345 --> 00:16:51,646
Keep going, Lonnie.

316
00:16:53,281 --> 00:16:54,615
She had a knife.

317
00:16:58,152 --> 00:16:59,320
What then?

318
00:17:01,723 --> 00:17:03,257
I took it away from her.

319
00:17:11,432 --> 00:17:12,800
What is it?

320
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,171
What is it, Lonnie?

321
00:17:28,683 --> 00:17:30,418
I killed her.

322
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:34,756
I killed my sweet Nancy!

323
00:17:38,393 --> 00:17:39,761
And where's Jenny?

324
00:17:40,294 --> 00:17:42,630
What did I do that for?

325
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,432
'Cause you like crack?

326
00:17:44,432 --> 00:17:45,900
My daughter!

327
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,002
I told you from the
start this guy did it.

328
00:17:48,002 --> 00:17:49,604
Now where is she?

329
00:17:54,909 --> 00:17:56,177
I sold her.

330
00:18:01,949 --> 00:18:04,118
Sold her? You sold her to who?

331
00:18:04,118 --> 00:18:07,422
He gave me $200.

332
00:18:07,855 --> 00:18:10,291
-Who did?
-This guy.

333
00:18:11,793 --> 00:18:13,361
He likes girls.

334
00:18:14,195 --> 00:18:17,732
How come nobody stopped me?

335
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:23,037
I don't know.

336
00:18:30,545 --> 00:18:32,047
<i>Search warrant!</i>

337
00:18:42,457 --> 00:18:43,825
George Sawyer.

338
00:18:46,762 --> 00:18:48,163
Where's Jenny Reeborg?

339
00:18:53,268 --> 00:18:55,270
"Sexy Schoolgirls."

340
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,905
"Jane at 15."

341
00:18:56,905 --> 00:18:58,173
This is quite the reading list.

342
00:18:58,173 --> 00:18:59,775
Where's my mother?

343
00:18:59,775 --> 00:19:02,311
-It's time for her medication.
-I'll make a call.

344
00:19:02,311 --> 00:19:03,812
Make sure she gets her meds.

345
00:19:03,812 --> 00:19:06,682
If you wanna hold this pervert's hand,
be my guest.

346
00:19:06,682 --> 00:19:08,216
Can I get you a cup of coffee?

347
00:19:20,562 --> 00:19:22,097
Okay.

348
00:19:23,131 --> 00:19:25,000
Who took my Ding Dongs?

349
00:19:25,667 --> 00:19:26,968
Problem, Dutch Boy?

350
00:19:26,968 --> 00:19:28,937
I had some Ding Dongs.
They're gone now.

351
00:19:28,937 --> 00:19:29,938
Ding Dongs?

352
00:19:29,938 --> 00:19:32,107
-What are you, in kindergarten?
-Look.

353
00:19:32,974 --> 00:19:35,310
I've got a suspect
whose profile screams:

354
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:37,779
"Organized,
humiliation-driven offender."

355
00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:39,314
Which means he won't crack easy.

356
00:19:39,314 --> 00:19:42,351
Which means an interrogation
that will go on all night.

357
00:19:42,351 --> 00:19:46,355
Which means I need my Ding Dongs
and you took them. Didn't you?

358
00:19:46,355 --> 00:19:49,024
Right. 'Cause I can't make
it through the night...

359
00:19:49,024 --> 00:19:50,992
...without one of your
precious Ding Dongs.

360
00:19:50,992 --> 00:19:53,395
Stay away from me,
and stay away from my desk.

361
00:19:53,395 --> 00:19:54,629
We got an interview.

362
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:58,133
-What are you all riled up about?
-He took my Ding Dongs.

363
00:19:58,133 --> 00:20:01,002
Come on, son.
Fork over his Ding Dongs.

364
00:20:05,774 --> 00:20:08,643
At my old squad, people had
respect for other people's...

365
00:20:08,643 --> 00:20:10,045
Forget it!

366
00:20:10,045 --> 00:20:12,447
How come everyone loves
this asshole so much?

367
00:20:12,848 --> 00:20:14,816
Let's go, we've got an interview.

368
00:20:14,816 --> 00:20:16,918
I think I saw some Twinkies
up in the break room.

369
00:20:16,918 --> 00:20:18,487
It's not the same thing.

370
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,425
Here's your coffee.

371
00:20:23,425 --> 00:20:25,460
When you gonna call about
my mom's pills?

372
00:20:26,261 --> 00:20:27,863
In a minute.

373
00:20:27,863 --> 00:20:29,631
I got nothing to hide.

374
00:20:30,198 --> 00:20:31,433
I know.

375
00:20:35,704 --> 00:20:36,938
Tell me something.

376
00:20:37,572 --> 00:20:39,708
Think there's something wrong
with gay people?

377
00:20:41,243 --> 00:20:42,544
Something wrong?

378
00:20:42,544 --> 00:20:44,146
In the head, you know.

379
00:20:44,146 --> 00:20:47,082
With queers, I mean,
you think they got a screw loose?

380
00:20:47,616 --> 00:20:50,051
-I don't know.
-Not so long ago...

381
00:20:50,051 --> 00:20:53,655
...medical community classified
homosexuality as a disorder.

382
00:20:53,655 --> 00:20:55,257
Called it an illness.

383
00:20:55,257 --> 00:20:56,458
Yeah?

384
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:59,728
Now scientists think maybe it's some
gene that makes people gay.

385
00:20:59,728 --> 00:21:00,962
So?

386
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,131
For booking.

387
00:21:04,399 --> 00:21:06,501
So if God made 'em that way...

388
00:21:06,501 --> 00:21:09,538
...who are we to say they're wrong
for doing the things they do?

389
00:21:10,338 --> 00:21:11,673
It got me thinking.

390
00:21:12,441 --> 00:21:14,075
What if scientists discovered...

391
00:21:14,075 --> 00:21:16,845
...there's a gene
that predisposes some people...

392
00:21:16,845 --> 00:21:18,413
...to be attracted to young girls?

393
00:21:19,748 --> 00:21:22,184
You think there is? In some people?

394
00:21:23,351 --> 00:21:28,223
Why not? And if scientists
discover that gene, then...

395
00:21:29,724 --> 00:21:31,726
Then maybe people won't think...

396
00:21:31,726 --> 00:21:34,062
...it's so wrong
to have sex with underage girls.

397
00:21:36,498 --> 00:21:37,699
Maybe not.

398
00:21:39,668 --> 00:21:42,137
Forgot to call about your mom's pills.

399
00:21:57,619 --> 00:21:59,321
How's the car running, Miguel?

400
00:22:01,756 --> 00:22:02,958
It's leaking oil.

401
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:05,660
Yeah, these old cars
always need a lot of work.

402
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:08,530
Must be a handy guy
with these tools laying around though.

403
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:10,265
No pliers though.

404
00:22:10,265 --> 00:22:13,335
-Miguel's not too fond of pliers.
-I can't say I blame him.

405
00:22:14,436 --> 00:22:15,971
Where's your lawyer, Miguel?

406
00:22:17,005 --> 00:22:18,573
I don't know.

407
00:22:29,117 --> 00:22:32,120
Miguel Esteana's dropping
his complaint against you.

408
00:22:33,255 --> 00:22:34,756
Told you it was bogus.

409
00:22:34,756 --> 00:22:37,959
I'd like your incident report
first thing tomorrow morning.

410
00:22:37,959 --> 00:22:41,796
Sure. It'll be a couple of days.
I got something on the back burner.

411
00:22:42,297 --> 00:22:43,765
It's not a request.

412
00:22:44,566 --> 00:22:45,867
Tomorrow morning.

413
00:22:46,501 --> 00:22:50,071
You'll get my report in a
couple of days. Maybe a week.

414
00:22:50,071 --> 00:22:52,607
You don't like the timetable,
you take it up with Gilroy.

415
00:22:52,607 --> 00:22:53,708
I don't have to.

416
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:56,177
In this building, I'm in charge.

417
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,081
Maybe in your own mind, amigo.

418
00:23:00,815 --> 00:23:02,884
But in the real world,
I don't answer to you.

419
00:23:02,884 --> 00:23:05,987
Not today, not tomorrow,
not even on Cinco de Mayo.

420
00:23:13,361 --> 00:23:14,696
You call for the police?

421
00:23:14,696 --> 00:23:16,598
Yeah, about two and a half hours ago.

422
00:23:16,598 --> 00:23:17,732
What's the problem?

423
00:23:17,732 --> 00:23:20,902
What you think the problem is?
Look at my goddamn tires!

424
00:23:20,902 --> 00:23:22,704
Someone slashed your tires?

425
00:23:22,704 --> 00:23:24,439
Was the real police busy today?

426
00:23:26,675 --> 00:23:30,078
-Any idea who might have done this?
-Lamar. He's my ex.

427
00:23:30,545 --> 00:23:33,648
I see he wasn't handling
his responsibilities as a man.

428
00:23:33,648 --> 00:23:37,218
I see that, I got no choice
but to step in.

429
00:23:38,153 --> 00:23:40,722
Did you witness
this Lamar slash your tires?

430
00:23:40,722 --> 00:23:42,958
Yeah, bro.
I got the whole thing on tape.

431
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:45,327
Come on, man.
The brother dumb, but he ain't stupid.

432
00:23:45,327 --> 00:23:46,962
Are you gonna go arrest him?

433
00:23:46,962 --> 00:23:48,196
We'll talk to him.

434
00:23:48,196 --> 00:23:50,432
In the meantime, can you
think of anyone else...

435
00:23:50,432 --> 00:23:51,967
...who might have slashed your tires?

436
00:23:51,967 --> 00:23:53,201
Like who?

437
00:23:53,902 --> 00:23:56,104
Maybe a business associate?

438
00:23:56,104 --> 00:23:58,206
Business associate?

439
00:23:58,206 --> 00:24:00,275
What, you tryin' to imply something?

440
00:24:00,275 --> 00:24:02,344
Nah. I'm just wondering...

441
00:24:02,344 --> 00:24:05,847
...why you got a $30,000 car
with $500 tires...

442
00:24:05,847 --> 00:24:08,850
...parked outside of a
$400-a-month apartment.

443
00:24:24,766 --> 00:24:26,868
<i>Give me the goddamn money for this...</i>

444
00:24:26,868 --> 00:24:28,803
You, go to work.

445
00:24:30,205 --> 00:24:33,008
Dmitri. Heard you got paroled.

446
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:35,443
I see you got your old job back.

447
00:24:35,443 --> 00:24:37,712
I'm just temping
for somebody who got the flu.

448
00:24:37,712 --> 00:24:38,947
Hand it over.

449
00:24:42,484 --> 00:24:44,185
Bankroll, too.

450
00:24:44,185 --> 00:24:46,788
Come on, Mackey, man.
That's just my playing-around coin.

451
00:24:49,658 --> 00:24:53,028
-This ain't right.
-Get lost.

452
00:24:53,028 --> 00:24:54,329
Yes, sir.

453
00:24:56,431 --> 00:25:00,035
What did I tell you last week?
No more free passes, right?

454
00:25:00,368 --> 00:25:03,238
-I know.
-Let's go. Come on.

455
00:25:13,882 --> 00:25:16,051
Any news on Two-Time's party?

456
00:25:16,051 --> 00:25:18,119
It's definitely on
for Saturday night.

457
00:25:19,387 --> 00:25:20,455
Sure?

458
00:25:20,989 --> 00:25:22,357
'Cause I gotta be sure.

459
00:25:23,758 --> 00:25:25,827
He called up Ringo...

460
00:25:25,827 --> 00:25:28,229
...and asked for his four best girls
for Saturday night.

461
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,035
Guess I got left off the list.

462
00:25:34,035 --> 00:25:36,271
Look like you lost some weight.
You been eating?

463
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:40,141
Sure, after business hours.

464
00:25:42,477 --> 00:25:43,778
I'll give you some money.

465
00:25:43,778 --> 00:25:45,780
Skip a couple of tricks,
get yourself some soup.

466
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,615
I don't need your money, Vic.

467
00:25:47,615 --> 00:25:50,285
Here. You look thin. Get some soup.

468
00:25:54,456 --> 00:25:55,990
Don't worry about me, Vic.

469
00:25:56,925 --> 00:25:58,126
I get by.

470
00:25:58,727 --> 00:26:00,028
Where's your boy?

471
00:26:03,865 --> 00:26:05,200
With my mom.

472
00:26:12,207 --> 00:26:14,142
Yeah. Get him some soup, too.

473
00:26:18,613 --> 00:26:21,916
-You're sweet, Vic.
-Go see your son.

474
00:26:27,355 --> 00:26:30,959
I got a daughter. 14 next month.

475
00:26:32,427 --> 00:26:34,562
She's got a few friends,
like to come over...

476
00:26:34,562 --> 00:26:36,698
...hang out, do homework,
that kind of thing.

477
00:26:37,298 --> 00:26:39,634
I don't know anything
about that missing girl.

478
00:26:41,069 --> 00:26:42,937
You know who Britney Spears is?

479
00:26:43,905 --> 00:26:45,173
I've seen videos.

480
00:26:45,173 --> 00:26:46,775
My daughter's got these friends...

481
00:26:46,775 --> 00:26:48,777
...who like to dress up
like Britney Spears.

482
00:26:49,811 --> 00:26:53,081
Tight jeans, cutoff T-shirts.

483
00:26:55,316 --> 00:26:56,384
13 years old.

484
00:26:58,853 --> 00:27:01,156
She's got this one friend.

485
00:27:01,156 --> 00:27:02,357
Natalie.

486
00:27:03,725 --> 00:27:05,059
I'm telling you...

487
00:27:05,994 --> 00:27:07,996
I know I shouldn't be thinking
what I'm thinking...

488
00:27:07,996 --> 00:27:10,698
...but the way this goddamn
girl looks, I mean...

489
00:27:11,332 --> 00:27:14,302
She may not be a woman yet,
but you can't call her a girl either.

490
00:27:14,302 --> 00:27:15,603
You know what I'm saying?

491
00:27:18,206 --> 00:27:19,774
Thirteen's a good age.

492
00:27:22,043 --> 00:27:24,946
Yeah, I bet it is.

493
00:27:26,147 --> 00:27:28,149
Can I get you some more coffee?

494
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:36,991
I didn't know he had a daughter.

495
00:27:36,991 --> 00:27:38,059
He doesn't.

496
00:27:41,296 --> 00:27:43,264
What's your take on Vic Mackey?

497
00:27:43,264 --> 00:27:44,332
How do you mean?

498
00:27:44,966 --> 00:27:46,234
You know what I mean.

499
00:27:48,169 --> 00:27:49,470
I hear things.

500
00:27:50,171 --> 00:27:53,208
But as long as he's producing on
the street, he's got friends.

501
00:27:53,208 --> 00:27:55,009
Gilroy, even the chief.

502
00:27:55,009 --> 00:27:57,645
-So he's bulletproof?
-From you, yeah.

503
00:27:59,013 --> 00:28:01,115
I know what everybody here thinks.

504
00:28:01,449 --> 00:28:04,252
I'm a test taker.
I didn't earn it on the street.

505
00:28:04,619 --> 00:28:06,154
Came time to name
a new captain,...

506
00:28:06,154 --> 00:28:08,022
...I was the right color
at the right time.

507
00:28:08,022 --> 00:28:10,825
You think taking on Mackey's
gonna change people's minds?

508
00:28:10,825 --> 00:28:12,293
I'm just talking.

509
00:28:13,761 --> 00:28:17,265
Right now, Vic Mackey must look like
a mighty big catch to you.

510
00:28:17,765 --> 00:28:19,701
Do the smart thing though, son.

511
00:28:20,201 --> 00:28:21,336
Cut bait.

512
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:23,738
It doesn't bother you,
the things he does?

513
00:28:23,738 --> 00:28:26,574
-I don't judge other cops.
-Mackey's not a cop.

514
00:28:26,574 --> 00:28:28,243
He's Al Capone with a badge.

515
00:28:28,243 --> 00:28:31,379
Al Capone made money
by giving people what they wanted.

516
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,348
What people want these days...

517
00:28:33,348 --> 00:28:36,251
...is to make it to their class
without getting mugged.

518
00:28:36,251 --> 00:28:39,487
Come home from work,
see their stereo still there.

519
00:28:39,487 --> 00:28:41,623
Hear about some murder
in the barrio...

520
00:28:41,623 --> 00:28:44,292
...find out the next day
the police caught the guy.

521
00:28:44,292 --> 00:28:46,027
If having all that means some cop...

522
00:28:46,027 --> 00:28:48,196
...roughs up some nigger or spic
in the ghetto...

523
00:28:48,196 --> 00:28:50,131
...as far as most people
are concerned...

524
00:28:50,131 --> 00:28:52,367
...it's don't ask, don't tell.

525
00:28:54,402 --> 00:28:56,437
How you figure on changing that?

526
00:29:10,218 --> 00:29:11,586
Lamar Tilton?

527
00:29:12,353 --> 00:29:13,454
Yeah?

528
00:29:13,454 --> 00:29:16,457
We're investigating vandalism to a
car owned by your ex-girlfriend.

529
00:29:16,457 --> 00:29:18,259
You mean the tires I slashed?

530
00:29:19,227 --> 00:29:21,496
-Yeah.
-You admit to vandalizing the car?

531
00:29:21,496 --> 00:29:22,597
Sure. Why not?

532
00:29:22,597 --> 00:29:24,299
How about 'cause the car isn't yours?

533
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:27,969
I gave that skank $1,500
on her down payment.

534
00:29:28,836 --> 00:29:31,572
Day after she makes the delivery,
she kicks me out...

535
00:29:31,572 --> 00:29:35,710
...then gives the car to this scrawny
bitch she's been balling on the side.

536
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:39,013
-Your point being?
-My point being $1,500!

537
00:29:39,547 --> 00:29:43,618
Shit. The way I figure it, that
at least make the tires mine.

538
00:29:43,618 --> 00:29:46,287
Look, you tell that bitch
if she got a problem with that...

539
00:29:46,287 --> 00:29:47,655
...she know where I am.

540
00:29:50,024 --> 00:29:52,226
Now this is all wrong, man.

541
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,028
Jewelry.

542
00:29:54,796 --> 00:29:58,132
-You see that new guy she's with?
-Yeah, I saw him.

543
00:29:58,132 --> 00:30:01,336
Then you know what kind of prick
I'm dealing with here.

544
00:30:02,303 --> 00:30:04,172
So where's the love?

545
00:30:04,172 --> 00:30:07,475
Bible. Galatians, chapter 7, verse 6.

546
00:30:07,475 --> 00:30:09,944
"For whatsoever a man soweth,
that shall he also reap."

547
00:30:09,944 --> 00:30:12,680
You can stop with the sermon, Grandma.

548
00:30:12,981 --> 00:30:14,182
When I'm gettin' outta here?

549
00:30:14,182 --> 00:30:16,417
As soon as you arraign
and you post bail.

550
00:30:18,553 --> 00:30:21,756
-You got anything else?
-How much bail gonna be?

551
00:30:21,756 --> 00:30:23,057
$200, $300.

552
00:30:23,057 --> 00:30:25,994
$200? I don't got that kind of cash.

553
00:30:28,062 --> 00:30:30,031
How were you able
to afford this jewelry then?

554
00:30:30,832 --> 00:30:32,767
I don't gotta explain myself to you.

555
00:30:34,469 --> 00:30:36,070
<i>Lonnie knew I liked them young.</i>

556
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:38,473
<i>He needed money.
</i>Said I could do whatever I wanted...

557
00:30:38,473 --> 00:30:39,874
...to his girl for $200.

558
00:30:39,874 --> 00:30:41,242
When he brought her by...

559
00:30:41,242 --> 00:30:43,945
...it was obvious
she was like seven, eight years old.

560
00:30:43,945 --> 00:30:45,146
Was that a problem?

561
00:30:45,146 --> 00:30:47,248
I told Lonnie I like 'em 12 or 13.

562
00:30:47,248 --> 00:30:49,684
Like you were talking about,
developed a little.

563
00:30:49,684 --> 00:30:50,952
You must have been disappointed.

564
00:30:50,952 --> 00:30:54,789
Yeah, but Lonnie'd
already spent the money, so...

565
00:30:55,289 --> 00:30:57,425
Even though I didn't want her,
the girl was...

566
00:30:57,425 --> 00:30:58,926
...you know, she was still mine.

567
00:30:58,926 --> 00:31:01,396
-So you got rid of her?
-I don't hurt 'em.

568
00:31:01,396 --> 00:31:04,432
I like 'em to like me. Romantic-like.

569
00:31:04,432 --> 00:31:06,401
Things just didn't work out this time.

570
00:31:06,968 --> 00:31:08,302
What'd you do with her?

571
00:31:08,302 --> 00:31:09,537
<i>I traded her.</i>

572
00:31:10,471 --> 00:31:13,274
-You traded her?
-To a doctor I met on the Internet.

573
00:31:13,274 --> 00:31:16,444
He likes them 7 or 8.
He came right over and picked her up.

574
00:31:17,011 --> 00:31:18,546
You traded her?

575
00:31:18,546 --> 00:31:20,415
I was out $200.

576
00:31:20,415 --> 00:31:22,583
What'd this doctor trade you?

577
00:31:22,583 --> 00:31:24,218
A girl to be named later.

578
00:31:25,053 --> 00:31:27,955
You know, like the kind of
trades ball teams make.

579
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:29,924
Right.

580
00:31:38,166 --> 00:31:40,802
-That's a nice boat.
-Thanks.

581
00:31:40,802 --> 00:31:43,104
I take the kids
up to Lake Powell every year.

582
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,605
You know, fishing and swimming.

583
00:31:44,605 --> 00:31:45,640
Sounds great.

584
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,208
Two weeks' vacation
doesn't make up...

585
00:31:47,208 --> 00:31:48,643
...for a year of double shifts...

586
00:31:48,643 --> 00:31:50,278
...but the kids really
look forward to it.

587
00:31:50,278 --> 00:31:51,512
How's the meat?

588
00:31:51,512 --> 00:31:53,448
Five more minutes,
you can bring out the buns.

589
00:31:53,448 --> 00:31:54,549
Great.

590
00:31:54,549 --> 00:31:57,285
Did you tell Matthew
he could keep a spider in his room?

591
00:31:57,285 --> 00:31:58,886
That's for a school project.

592
00:31:58,886 --> 00:32:01,089
-If that thing gets loose...
-It won't.

593
00:32:01,089 --> 00:32:02,423
Yeah, it better not.

594
00:32:02,423 --> 00:32:05,159
-It won't.
-Better not.

595
00:32:08,729 --> 00:32:11,499
What did I tell you
about jumping in the...

596
00:32:12,834 --> 00:32:14,769
They grow up too quick.

597
00:32:14,769 --> 00:32:16,537
Especially with the job we got.

598
00:32:17,205 --> 00:32:20,274
Yeah, what you're doing though,
has to be done.

599
00:32:20,274 --> 00:32:21,776
You think?

600
00:32:21,776 --> 00:32:23,244
Absolutely.

601
00:32:23,878 --> 00:32:26,681
My dad was a cop.
He admired guys like you.

602
00:32:26,681 --> 00:32:29,717
Those were some
honest-to-goodness men back then.

603
00:32:29,717 --> 00:32:34,021
Guys like Captain Aceveda,
they never understand.

604
00:32:34,021 --> 00:32:36,157
What do you expect
from a damn quota baby?

605
00:32:39,627 --> 00:32:41,896
I think I could be a lot
more useful to you.

606
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:44,432
You know, do more than just drive.

607
00:32:44,899 --> 00:32:46,200
Yeah?

608
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,870
Yeah. I know why you've been reluctant
to include me.

609
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:50,638
You got a team. You watch
out for each other,...

610
00:32:50,638 --> 00:32:52,406
...know how the
others will move.

611
00:32:52,406 --> 00:32:54,175
You'd kill to protect each other.

612
00:32:54,976 --> 00:32:57,111
It's all about trust,
otherwise, you end up dead.

613
00:32:57,111 --> 00:32:58,212
Yeah.

614
00:32:59,814 --> 00:33:01,282
Listen.

615
00:33:01,282 --> 00:33:04,152
Up till now, Two-Time's has
been impossible to nail.

616
00:33:04,152 --> 00:33:06,354
Never keeps drugs at his place
until tonight.

617
00:33:06,354 --> 00:33:08,055
Yeah, what's so special about tonight?

618
00:33:08,055 --> 00:33:10,124
He's gearing up for a big bash
tomorrow night.

619
00:33:10,124 --> 00:33:12,994
He's got a bunch of coke
he's handing out as party favors.

620
00:33:12,994 --> 00:33:15,163
Our one chance to nail him
with the goods.

621
00:33:15,163 --> 00:33:18,065
-Lock and load, baby.
-Yeah!

622
00:33:18,065 --> 00:33:20,535
This is not gonna be
any beauty pageant, ladies.

623
00:33:20,535 --> 00:33:21,869
He's got steel-enforced doors...

624
00:33:21,869 --> 00:33:25,139
...so we go through a window
and be fast before he starts flushing.

625
00:33:25,139 --> 00:33:26,340
Knock, knock, who's there?

626
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,743
Strike Team, Mr. Drug Dealer.

627
00:33:29,844 --> 00:33:33,314
And on top of that, Terry here
is losing his cherry tonight.

628
00:33:33,314 --> 00:33:36,150
-He's coming with us.
-Terry is losing his cherry.

629
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:38,519
Welcome aboard. Congratulations.

630
00:33:39,754 --> 00:33:44,158
Remember, the team comes first.
We take care of each other, all right?

631
00:33:45,126 --> 00:33:47,295
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

632
00:33:50,198 --> 00:33:52,433
We just have a few more questions.

633
00:33:52,433 --> 00:33:54,502
-Dr. Grady.
-Right, Dr. Grady.

634
00:33:54,502 --> 00:33:56,103
And I have a practice to attend to...

635
00:33:56,103 --> 00:33:59,440
...patients to see, so charge me
with something or release me.

636
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,209
Do you know who Jenny Reeborg is?

637
00:34:01,209 --> 00:34:02,677
-No.
-George Sawyer says...

638
00:34:02,677 --> 00:34:05,947
...he gave Jenny to you
for the purpose of sexual intercourse.

639
00:34:05,947 --> 00:34:08,182
I don't even know the man.

640
00:34:08,916 --> 00:34:10,451
You tell us where Jenny is...

641
00:34:10,451 --> 00:34:12,753
...we'll get the DA to
make a favorable offer.

642
00:34:12,753 --> 00:34:14,455
Charge me or release me.

643
00:34:15,323 --> 00:34:16,924
We'll see what we can do.

644
00:34:18,526 --> 00:34:19,927
Tell me something.

645
00:34:19,927 --> 00:34:22,530
As a man of science,
I'd like your opinion.

646
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:25,333
Is homosexuality genetic
or environment?

647
00:34:25,333 --> 00:34:27,168
The latest studies
suggest it's genetic.

648
00:34:27,168 --> 00:34:31,405
Really? Just the way they are?
Can't help themselves?

649
00:34:31,405 --> 00:34:33,207
I see where you're going with this.

650
00:34:33,908 --> 00:34:35,610
Don't waste my time.

651
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:37,445
Or yours.

652
00:34:38,846 --> 00:34:40,348
I've got plenty of time.

653
00:34:41,916 --> 00:34:43,517
I'm bored.

654
00:34:43,517 --> 00:34:45,319
<i>Charge me or release me.</i>

655
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:50,825
This guy is definitely
a domination-control pedophile.

656
00:34:50,825 --> 00:34:52,393
Is he capable of killing her?

657
00:34:52,393 --> 00:34:53,828
Fits the profile.

658
00:34:53,828 --> 00:34:55,496
Let him sit for a
couple hours, try again.

659
00:34:55,496 --> 00:34:56,697
Couple hours?

660
00:34:56,697 --> 00:34:58,633
Girl's missing since
yesterday morning.

661
00:34:58,633 --> 00:34:59,834
Has she got food or water?

662
00:34:59,834 --> 00:35:01,269
I can break him by
the end of the day.

663
00:35:01,269 --> 00:35:04,105
Take all week. There's no way
this pecker's gonna talk.

664
00:35:04,105 --> 00:35:06,574
I know what buttons to push
with this guy.

665
00:35:06,574 --> 00:35:07,742
I'm smarter than he is.

666
00:35:07,742 --> 00:35:10,144
This is not a quiz show, Dutch.
Lose the ego.

667
00:35:10,144 --> 00:35:11,545
Think about Jenny Reeborg.

668
00:35:11,545 --> 00:35:13,648
-I am. You got a better plan?
-Yes.

669
00:35:13,648 --> 00:35:14,915
Let him go.

670
00:35:14,915 --> 00:35:16,384
-Let him go?
-We tail him.

671
00:35:16,384 --> 00:35:19,587
If we lose him, first thing he'll
do is kill her, dump the body.

672
00:35:19,587 --> 00:35:22,590
-Look, I can break this guy.
-Your way will get her killed.

673
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,924
So will yours!

674
00:35:27,828 --> 00:35:29,230
Anywhere in here.

675
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:31,799
-What about attack dogs?
-I hate dogs.

676
00:35:32,967 --> 00:35:34,168
I need you.

677
00:35:48,749 --> 00:35:50,084
And who are you?

678
00:35:52,153 --> 00:35:53,287
<i>Who is he?</i>

679
00:35:59,493 --> 00:36:01,329
You know what you're doing, son?

680
00:36:07,368 --> 00:36:09,036
What's in the bag?

681
00:36:22,083 --> 00:36:23,484
What's that stuff for?

682
00:36:24,652 --> 00:36:27,855
That's what I'm gonna use to get you
to tell me where Jenny Reeborg is.

683
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:30,925
Your turn to play bad cop?

684
00:36:30,925 --> 00:36:34,862
No. Good cop and bad
cop left for the day.

685
00:36:36,163 --> 00:36:38,065
I'm a different kind of cop.

686
00:36:41,969 --> 00:36:43,971
<i>I'm ready to see my lawyer now.</i>

687
00:36:43,971 --> 00:36:45,306
<i>Later.</i>

688
00:36:45,973 --> 00:36:48,809
Right now it's just you and me.

689
00:36:49,744 --> 00:36:51,479
People are watching us.

690
00:36:54,682 --> 00:36:56,484
I got a little girl back at home.

691
00:36:56,484 --> 00:36:59,553
8-year-old daughter.
Her name is Cassidy.

692
00:37:00,721 --> 00:37:03,891
What do you say I bring her down here?
Let you stick your dick in her.

693
00:37:04,392 --> 00:37:05,826
How'd you like that?

694
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:08,462
-What?
-You know.

695
00:37:08,896 --> 00:37:10,998
Suck her tits a little bit maybe?

696
00:37:12,066 --> 00:37:13,401
Not interested.

697
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:17,838
So you want to have some other guy's
little girl, but not my Cassidy?

698
00:37:17,838 --> 00:37:19,240
What's up with that, man?

699
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,842
I'd like to take a look
at this Jenny for myself.

700
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:25,012
See what she's got
that my Cassidy doesn't.

701
00:37:26,046 --> 00:37:27,882
I'm sure you could arrange that.

702
00:37:28,616 --> 00:37:30,284
I don't know where the girl is.

703
00:37:30,284 --> 00:37:31,986
Her name is Jenny Reeborg.

704
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:35,689
I'm giving you one chance to let
me know where you're hiding her.

705
00:37:35,689 --> 00:37:37,792
I'm sorry. I wish I could...

706
00:37:47,968 --> 00:37:49,737
You're the police!

707
00:38:20,768 --> 00:38:23,071
He's got a basement apartment
under a fake name.

708
00:38:23,071 --> 00:38:24,305
Jenny's there alone.

709
00:38:24,305 --> 00:38:26,307
Last he knew, she was still alive.

710
00:38:30,712 --> 00:38:32,714
You got something to say, Dutch boy?

711
00:38:34,249 --> 00:38:36,484
Like, "Thanks for solving my case"?

712
00:38:37,986 --> 00:38:39,487
Just glad I could help!

713
00:39:16,991 --> 00:39:18,126
Jenny?

714
00:39:24,766 --> 00:39:26,367
Watch out.

715
00:39:28,403 --> 00:39:31,973
Come on, goddamn it. Come on!

716
00:39:45,053 --> 00:39:46,621
It's okay, baby.

717
00:39:47,188 --> 00:39:48,323
Jenny.

718
00:39:48,323 --> 00:39:50,858
Jenny, you're safe now, sweetie.

719
00:39:50,858 --> 00:39:52,360
You're safe now.

720
00:39:58,066 --> 00:40:00,768
No way, man. I ain't
got to listen to you.

721
00:40:02,737 --> 00:40:04,105
Dutch.

722
00:40:04,572 --> 00:40:06,007
Heard you found your missing girl.

723
00:40:06,007 --> 00:40:10,111
Yeah, guy turned out to be
a domination-control sociopath.

724
00:40:10,111 --> 00:40:12,981
Had her locked in this cage thing.

725
00:40:12,981 --> 00:40:14,382
Good thing you took him out.

726
00:40:14,382 --> 00:40:15,550
Yeah.

727
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:17,385
So what are you doing here?

728
00:40:17,385 --> 00:40:19,287
Your shift was over this morning.

729
00:40:19,287 --> 00:40:21,289
As I... Right?

730
00:40:21,289 --> 00:40:24,559
Wickman and Greenwalt called in sick
and me and Julien worked a double.

731
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:27,295
-I hate doubles.
-I'm on my way home now.

732
00:40:27,295 --> 00:40:30,298
Listen, I was gonna grab a beer...

733
00:40:30,298 --> 00:40:32,800
...with some of my old buddies
from Sunset in case...

734
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,169
-...you wanna tag along?
-That'd be great.

735
00:40:35,169 --> 00:40:38,172
-Great.
-But I'm not free...

736
00:40:38,172 --> 00:40:39,240
...tonight.

737
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:42,243
I mean, my friend Betsy set me up
on this blind date.

738
00:40:42,243 --> 00:40:44,012
It's probably gonna
be a nightmare and...

739
00:40:44,012 --> 00:40:46,414
No, it sounds like fun.

740
00:40:46,414 --> 00:40:47,982
So some other time, okay?

741
00:40:47,982 --> 00:40:50,518
I'd love to go out
with you and the guys and stuff...

742
00:40:50,518 --> 00:40:52,587
...and hear some of the old stories.

743
00:40:52,587 --> 00:40:54,956
-What's that smell?
-What?

744
00:40:54,956 --> 00:40:56,357
You don't smell that?

745
00:40:57,358 --> 00:40:59,527
Man. Yeah.

746
00:41:05,166 --> 00:41:06,834
What is that?

747
00:41:06,834 --> 00:41:09,737
It's dog shit. Jesus Christ.

748
00:41:09,737 --> 00:41:13,875
All right. Whoever did this
better clean it up right now.

749
00:41:15,176 --> 00:41:17,512
It's you, isn't it?
You clean this up,...

750
00:41:17,512 --> 00:41:19,313
...or I'm gonna shove
it down your throat.

751
00:41:19,313 --> 00:41:20,882
You got the wrong guy.

752
00:41:21,382 --> 00:41:23,451
I promise you, I am not gonna rest...

753
00:41:23,451 --> 00:41:25,353
...until the culprit
is brought to justice.

754
00:41:25,353 --> 00:41:27,255
Attention, everyone.

755
00:41:27,255 --> 00:41:29,323
I'm declaring this an
official crime scene.

756
00:41:29,323 --> 00:41:32,460
Nobody leaves here
without providing a stool sample.

757
00:41:34,429 --> 00:41:36,364
Who gets to bag the evidence?

758
00:41:42,136 --> 00:41:44,705
-Some prank.
-Yeah.

759
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,976
You know, I once heard about
this old cop tradition.

760
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:53,014
Anytime someone in the squad
started getting a big head...

761
00:41:53,014 --> 00:41:55,750
...some other cop
would put dog crap in his locker.

762
00:41:56,284 --> 00:41:57,351
Or desk.

763
00:41:58,486 --> 00:42:00,188
Remind him he's just one guy.

764
00:42:00,888 --> 00:42:02,156
Part of the team.

765
00:42:04,192 --> 00:42:05,660
You heard about that?

766
00:44:18,659 --> 00:44:19,994
Get up.
