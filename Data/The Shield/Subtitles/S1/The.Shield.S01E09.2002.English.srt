1
00:00:00,834 --> 00:00:02,702
<i>Previously on The Shield:</i>

2
00:00:02,702 --> 00:00:04,304
That's my book.

3
00:00:04,304 --> 00:00:06,506
Matthew has autism.

4
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:08,408
Jesus...

5
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:11,478
This a brotherhood.
Everybody knows that except you.

6
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:13,213
You gotta decide if you
wanna stay partners.

7
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:16,649
If you do, start opening up,
if you don't, talk to Aceveda.

8
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:19,385
He already turned me down when
I asked him for a new partner.

9
00:00:19,385 --> 00:00:21,054
Maybe he'll give you
a different answer.

10
00:00:21,654 --> 00:00:23,089
My husband was murdered.

11
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,892
This one's been hangin' on
the vine for a year, man.

12
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:27,594
She is ripe.

13
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:33,500
Handin' in this arrest report's
the only way I can think...

14
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,301
...to stop you from
making a huge mistake.

15
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:37,036
That report doesn't prove anything.

16
00:00:37,036 --> 00:00:39,239
I don't have to prove you're gay.

17
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,741
In this house,
all I gotta do is say it.

18
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,244
With all the gory details.

19
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:46,246
I'm not sure they stolen any drugs.

20
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:48,014
What?

21
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:49,682
It was dark, they were
at the other end.

22
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:51,050
My view was obstructed.

23
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,819
-Mackey got to you.
-No.

24
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:54,654
-He threatened you.
-He didn't.

25
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:55,922
Might not feel like it.

26
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:58,625
But you did the right thing yesterday.

27
00:00:58,625 --> 00:00:59,859
You were there for me.

28
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,694
I'm there for you.

29
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:07,967
Come on, homes!

30
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:09,903
Shut up!

31
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:18,378
Get up!

32
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:20,747
Want me to ____ you?

33
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:26,719
I said stay down!

34
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:33,226
I said shut up!

35
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:40,366
-Stop!
-Shut up!

36
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:42,135
-Please.
-Shut up!

37
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:48,875
Don't look so bad to me?
You gonna follow us?

38
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:49,976
No!

39
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:52,679
Gonna follow us? Didn't think so!
No!

40
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:57,850
Too late.
I see you're losin' air, homes.

41
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,424
Have a pack on me.

42
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:09,796
-So, how many were there?
-Three.

43
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:13,199
Yeah, they wore bandannas and masks.

44
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:15,935
-I could tell they were beaners.
-How?

45
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:19,472
By the way they talked.
Spanish tattoos.

46
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:20,740
Describe one.

47
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:24,444
I saw a serpent with wings.

48
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:27,747
The other one was just "L.M."

49
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:31,150
It's Los Mags. We'd better call Vic.

50
00:02:31,517 --> 00:02:33,987
Matthew, what's this?

51
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:36,255
A girl.

52
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,491
How does she feel?

53
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,295
Can't you tell?

54
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,431
Hungry?

55
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:47,166
Maybe Daddy can help.

56
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:48,701
Daddy's hungry, too.

57
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:52,605
Maybe she's hungry. What else is she?

58
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,407
Happy?

59
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:55,875
Yes.

60
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,276
She's happy.

61
00:02:59,278 --> 00:03:00,913
And this girl?

62
00:03:00,913 --> 00:03:02,782
How does she feel?

63
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:04,384
Happy.

64
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:12,225
It's work.

65
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:14,961
Today's your day off.

66
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:22,669
Yeah.

67
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:25,004
All right, I'll come in.

68
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:29,709
Been another truck-jacking.

69
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:34,614
I need a break. I'm sick.
I haven't slept more than two hours...

70
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:36,582
-...all week long.
-I know.

71
00:03:36,582 --> 00:03:38,751
Shane gets three days off
to go play in Vegas.

72
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:41,154
Shane's not in charge. I am.

73
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,856
The new baby-sitter
starts tomorrow.

74
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:46,159
Things'll get a lot
easier for you then.

75
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:49,562
When will you be home?

76
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:51,831
As soon as I can.

77
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:14,087
Cesar, tear yourself away, will ya?

78
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,422
-One sec.
-Yeah.

79
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:25,031
Newlyweds.

80
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:27,800
Giving each other matching
genital rings as wedding gifts.

81
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,737
-It's a beautiful thing.
-I'll take your word for it.

82
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,605
Check this out.

83
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:36,609
Any idea who that tattoo belongs to?
Not my work. Lacks the detail.

84
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,178
Belongs to a Los Mag.
Gotta be a local.

85
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:42,248
I'll make a couple of calls.
See what I can dig up for ya.

86
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:51,524
Cholo rising.

87
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:55,261
Latino. 20s.

88
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,333
-And there's the girlfriend.
-Thank you, Cesar.

89
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:02,668
Hector Estanza.

90
00:05:02,668 --> 00:05:04,504
-Let's rock.
-Let's do it.

91
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:19,485
Why you gotta be so stupid?
Leave me alone.

92
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:22,622
Remember, this guy likes
to hurt people, so be ready.

93
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:24,757
Go! Freeze! Police!

94
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:27,226
-What are you doing?
-On the floor!

95
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:28,427
On the floor, now!

96
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:31,130
Stop!

97
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,965
Freeze!

98
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:34,667
Okay!
Gun!

99
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:35,968
Lem!

100
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:37,503
He's got a gun!

101
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:39,806
My God.

102
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:44,243
Shit! I thought it was a gun.
Check and see if he's got one.

103
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:46,579
-Vic?
-We got him!

104
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:47,914
Stay inside the house!

105
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:50,550
-I don't see nothing!
-Damn.

106
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,585
What do we do?
We just got clear.

107
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:56,022
I shot an unarmed guy.
All right. He's the jacker.

108
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,590
We're gonna figure out what to say.

109
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,393
What, he threatened us
with cigarettes, so I shot him?

110
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:01,861
Just let me think!

111
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:07,934
6-Paul-11. Shots fired.
2728 Verbano Avenue.

112
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:11,604
Suspect is down.
Requesting backup and an ambulance.

113
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:29,288
-Man, Vic.
-I know.

114
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:31,257
I don't like it any more
than you do...

115
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:33,726
...but we can't afford
to take another hit right now.

116
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,028
You saw what he did
to that truck driver.

117
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:38,030
Yeah. I know.

118
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,932
All right. Come on.

119
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:41,133
Vic?

120
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,570
Want to tell me what happened?

121
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,439
We got a sketch off
the jacking victim.

122
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:51,210
It was a Los Mag banger.
My CI turned me on to Hector Estanza.

123
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,914
-We sit on the girl he lives with...
-He shows up, we go in, he runs.

124
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:59,085
The guy turns on me. He had me
dead to rights. Lem saved my ass.

125
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,220
As righteous as a shoot gets.

126
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,421
Chaco?

127
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:05,157
What did you do?

128
00:07:05,157 --> 00:07:07,760
-Chaco?
-Don't worry.

129
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,195
Your boyfriend's gonna make it.

130
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:12,798
Boyfriend? That's my brother Chaco.

131
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:17,904
You shot the wrong guy?

132
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,452
We shot Hector's girlfriend's brother.

133
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,888
He had a carton
of stolen cancer sticks on him...

134
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:36,790
...and a gun pointed right at me.

135
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,526
-He's still the right guy.
-He and Hector are both Los Mags.

136
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:42,128
Probably part of the same crew.
We'll get Hector next.

137
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,264
-Is the girl involved?
-Not that I know of.

138
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:46,233
Lem's at the hospital
getting her statement.

139
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:47,834
Boyfriend beat her up bad.

140
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:50,103
-Maybe she'll roll on him.
-Here's hoping.

141
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,138
Officer Lowe.

142
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:56,810
Taking back your IAD
statement hurt me.

143
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,011
It hurt me bad.

144
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:00,847
It let Mackey off the hook.

145
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:04,651
There's clearly misconduct here.

146
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:08,688
Give me one good reason
why I should let you off the hook.

147
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:11,157
All my life, I wanted to be a cop.

148
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:14,194
I grew up in this neighborhood.
I want to make a difference here.

149
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:18,198
You could've made that difference
by taking down Vic.

150
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,770
I knew I got in over my head
when I first made those charges.

151
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,640
I'm worried you've made a pact
with Mackey.

152
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,942
No, sir.
I've got nothing to do with him.

153
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:32,045
I just want a fresh
start, to be a good cop.

154
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:33,313
I'll prove it to you.

155
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,284
You'll receive an official reprimand.

156
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:39,953
I'm docking a week's pay
and putting you on probation.

157
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:42,355
I'll decide in a month
whether or not to keep you on.

158
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:44,791
Thank you.

159
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,964
Captain...

160
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:54,234
A new training officer might help me
with that fresh start.

161
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:56,403
You don't get to choose
who you partner with.

162
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:58,171
Neither does Officer Sofer.

163
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:03,777
Ms. Orozco?

164
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:05,912
Tigre.

165
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:10,383
-I'm Curtis.
-What do you want?

166
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:13,787
Can we talk about the Los Mags
and your brother?

167
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:16,790
My brother jumped Los Mags
three years ago. He's out.

168
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,491
He didn't look "out" last night.

169
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:22,696
He was protecting me from
the same guy Hector.

170
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:24,597
So Hector beat you up.

171
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:27,067
He didn't like me
breaking up with him.

172
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,469
You ever think about pressing charges?

173
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:31,371
Yeah, like you guys can protect me.

174
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:33,440
Chaco was taking care
of me until your guy...

175
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,141
...shot him and he don't
even bang no more.

176
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:38,044
-You're sure about that?
-You don't want to believe me?

177
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,446
Ask around.

178
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:44,384
We decided
we'd better cut him loose.

179
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:45,885
Coyotes?

180
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:49,322
This time of year,
the rabbits have gone underground.

181
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:52,392
Coyotes get hungry, can't find food,
they come down to forage.

182
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:54,227
Thank you, Ranger Rick.

183
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:56,062
My grandpa had a farm.

184
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:01,768
Over here.

185
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:08,875
-It's about time.
-I'm moving as fast as I can.

186
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:12,212
His name is Maynard Hawkins.

187
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:14,347
Maynard...

188
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:17,283
I'm Detective Wyms.
This is Detective Wagenbach.

189
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,085
Were you chained up
outside all night?

190
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:20,954
I don't want to be no trouble.

191
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,889
You're not the one
who's in trouble.

192
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:25,792
He's got some pretty serious bites.
Where are the paramedics?

193
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,594
I'll go call 'em this time.

194
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,263
For God's sakes,
cut him loose.

195
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:35,101
Leave me alone. I'm fine.

196
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:40,006
He's blind.

197
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:45,278
-What's goin' on?
-Who are you?

198
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:48,114
I'm Lloyd. That's my dad.

199
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:51,351
Lloyd, your father's been attacked
by coyotes.

200
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:52,519
No.

201
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,754
I'm sorry, Pop.

202
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:57,490
I can explain.

203
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,359
Save it for the station.

204
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:10,937
Daddy.

205
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:12,872
What are you doing here?

206
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,941
Came to see you.

207
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:16,075
What's wrong?

208
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:18,511
I just needed a good place to read.

209
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,049
I can't talk right now.
I've got a case and...

210
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:25,351
Dutch, my father, Bryce.

211
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,454
Professor Wyms,
glad to finally meet you.

212
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:28,655
It's my pleasure.

213
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:31,424
Go ahead. I'll wait.

214
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:36,229
-lt could be hours.
-I'm only on page 23...

215
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:38,965
...and I imagine this
is a fascinating place.

216
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:41,367
-It is.
-Actually, it's not.

217
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:44,737
-Why don't you be the judge?
-All right.

218
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,575
<i>-I don't understand why I'm here.
</i>-You're in trouble.

219
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:51,010
Shouldn't you be in there
for point-counterpoint?

220
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:53,613
There is no counterpoint.

221
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:55,915
He's guilty.
It's down to a matter of degree.

222
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:58,251
<i>Elderly abuse. That's a felony.</i>

223
00:11:58,251 --> 00:12:00,920
So it's the subtle
fractions of culpability...

224
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,256
...that conspire to determine
that man's fate?

225
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,726
I like the way you talk.

226
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:11,097
You had your father tied up outside
like an animal without shelter.

227
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:14,801
-I can explain that.
-I'm listening.

228
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:16,336
I'm divorced.

229
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:18,171
Surprise me some more.

230
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:23,943
I pay alimony and child support,
and I fell behind.

231
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:26,980
State garnishes my wages, and...

232
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,715
I miss some payments
to the nursing home...

233
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:30,483
...and they kicked my pop out.

234
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,652
Did you try to place him
in another home?

235
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,223
It costs too much.
I'm barely scraping by as it is.

236
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:38,825
What about his benefits?

237
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:44,097
After food and $50 a month
to keep him in Depends...

238
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,298
...there ain't nothin' left.

239
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:47,800
So you leave him outside, chained up.

240
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:54,641
-He's blind. He wanders.
-Where's your mother?

241
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:56,609
Ran off,
left me to care for him.

242
00:12:56,609 --> 00:13:00,213
I'm telling you, it is the system
that is screwing him over...

243
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:01,281
...not me.

244
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,319
That's so you don't wander.

245
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:10,390
Brian, thanks for the drop-by.

246
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,526
Travis, what a shock
to see you back here again.

247
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,362
It's like going to a family reunion.

248
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:20,833
I want to ask
about one of your parolees.

249
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,970
-Which one? I've only got about 300.
-He's a Los Mag.

250
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:27,807
That narrows it down to about 30.
His name's Chaco Orozco.

251
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,542
Yeah, Chaco.

252
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:30,843
That was quick.

253
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:33,112
That's because
I remember the good ones by name.

254
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:37,250
-So he's a good guy?
-I wish they were all like him.

255
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:40,787
He's not in any kind
of trouble, is he?

256
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:44,891
-I think we made a mistake.
-Why?

257
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:48,061
I just talked to his parole officer
and his Clean Slate counselor.

258
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:51,030
"Clean Slate"?
Program for bangers who want out.

259
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,031
What did his counselor say?

260
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:54,500
He's been in three years,
never missed a meeting.

261
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,903
He counsels bangers
on how to get out of the life.

262
00:13:56,903 --> 00:14:00,340
That doesn't mean he didn't
get back in. Let's not forget, he ran.

263
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,209
He didn't want to get caught
with Hector's stolen smokes.

264
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,078
So if his sister says he's clean...

265
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:06,813
What about his gang tatts?

266
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:08,548
Tigre says he's getting
them lasered off.

267
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:10,950
Wait a minute. His
sister has a name now?

268
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:15,288
Can we just talk to Chaco,
hear his side of things?

269
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:21,527
I hope to hell you're wrong, man.

270
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:25,298
You want me to pass it on to the DA?

271
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:28,835
Not yet. I'm going
to get more answers from the father.

272
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:30,670
Come on. I'll walk you out.

273
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,673
-Rebecca wants you to meet Warner.
-I don't want to meet Warner.

274
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:36,109
-He's her fianc?
-She has a husband.

275
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:39,545
They come 3,000 miles from Boston,
and you won't see your own daughter?

276
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,614
I'm dying to see her,
but it's not fair...

277
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:43,650
...I have to meet this
new boyfriend...

278
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:46,085
...when we should be trying
to save her marriage.

279
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:48,621
She's not going to leave Warner
alone in a hotel room.

280
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:50,890
-There you go.
-Don't be so hard, Peaches.

281
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,158
I'm not.

282
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:56,029
Rebecca's been married to Gordon
11 months and she's giving up?

283
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:59,365
-Do you think she really tried?
-She's a big girl now.

284
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:01,567
Where'd you park?

285
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,504
Rebecca and Warner dropped me off
on their way to the Getty.

286
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:07,507
-I'll give you a ride back.
-Actually, I'm staying awhile.

287
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:09,575
Dutch has offered to show me around.

288
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:14,280
I'm only guilty
for trying to protect Tigre.

289
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,916
-Why'd you run?
-Stolen cigs.

290
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,251
Los Mag tatts.

291
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:20,420
I knew you wouldn't believe me.

292
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:22,021
You were right.

293
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:24,524
Not to mention the setup,
planting that gun.

294
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:25,858
That's my third strike.

295
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:28,261
-They planted the gun on you?
-No way.

296
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,431
Next time, check your
pockets before leaving the house.

297
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,101
Why don't we get to
what matters here?

298
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,570
-What's that?
-What are you gonna do to protect her?

299
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:40,106
Hector finds out the
cops got his cigarettes,...

300
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,708
...he'll think she called it in.

301
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:45,611
Hector's gonna want to do a lot worse
than beat her.

302
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:50,483
Where does Hector keep
his stolen merch? Who's in your crew?

303
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:53,119
I don't live that life anymore.

304
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,688
She needs protection.
She'll get it.

305
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,195
That must have hurt like a mother...

306
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:04,664
...getting that thing lasered off.

307
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:05,698
Yeah.

308
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:07,967
Worse than getting shot.

309
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:13,072
-This isn't good. I believe him.
-Me, too.

310
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:14,807
Christ, man, I knew it.

311
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,478
Third strike,
and all he cares about is his sister.

312
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:19,846
We set up the wrong guy.

313
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:21,581
-What if I'd killed him?
-You didn't.

314
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:23,683
-Yeah, but I could've.
-Man.

315
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:25,218
What did I do?

316
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:27,587
Okay, what do we do now?

317
00:16:28,955 --> 00:16:30,156
I don't know.

318
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:36,129
We gotta clear this guy.

319
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:39,466
- Nobody's arguing.
- How do we lift the gun charge?

320
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:43,803
We'll make the gun disappear
sneak into the evidence room.

321
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:46,473
That place
is like Grand Central Station.

322
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:47,640
During the day.

323
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:49,943
We'll hit it tonight.

324
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,879
But now we put the
right guy behind bars.

325
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:55,982
We'll find Hector, sit on him, be
there when he moves on his next job.

326
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:57,851
What if his next job's Tigre?

327
00:16:57,851 --> 00:17:01,354
Lem, you baby-sit Tigre. Ronnie,
you're on Hector patrol with me.

328
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,823
We made this mess,
we're gonna clean it up.

329
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:06,993
Hang on a second.

330
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,364
Hello?

331
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:14,000
Where are you?
You've been gone since yesterday.

332
00:17:15,235 --> 00:17:17,170
Yeah, I'm still working on this.

333
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,939
Matthew has been calling for you
since this morning.

334
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:21,941
-He needs you here.
-I know.

335
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:24,511
-I thought you made an arrest.
-There's more.

336
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:26,913
I need a prescription from Rite Aid.

337
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:28,681
Is the baby-sitter there?

338
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:30,617
-Yes.
-Well, go.

339
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,154
I'd have to leave her with the kids.

340
00:17:34,154 --> 00:17:37,190
We hired a baby-sitter
you don't trust with the kids?

341
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,627
When are you coming home?

342
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:42,662
<i>Daddy!</i>

343
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:48,468
How will the Dodgers do this year?

344
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:50,069
I don't follow baseball.

345
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,239
Would it be profiling if I said,
"I bet you follow basketball"?

346
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:57,744
Actually, I heard you
were a Clippers fan.

347
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:58,878
Yeah.

348
00:17:58,878 --> 00:18:00,480
Two tickets.

349
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,415
Floor seats. I can't make it.

350
00:18:04,818 --> 00:18:07,620
We gotta roll. I'm putting
together a softball team...

351
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,290
...to take on those beach cops
over in Venice.

352
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,791
I'm penciling you in.

353
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,092
Center fielder.

354
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,328
Talk to you later.

355
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,976
-You're here.
-As promised.

356
00:18:29,976 --> 00:18:32,145
-Nice bike.
-Thanks.

357
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:33,379
Hope you chained it.

358
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:35,482
-You ride?
-'Cause I'm a gang chick?

359
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:38,017
I just wanted to know if you rode.

360
00:18:38,017 --> 00:18:39,486
So how does this work?

361
00:18:39,486 --> 00:18:41,688
I keep you safe until
we arrest Hector.

362
00:18:51,064 --> 00:18:53,032
What do you think you're doing?

363
00:19:02,876 --> 00:19:05,545
-I think I got it covered.
-You think?

364
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:07,480
Yeah.

365
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,382
Ain't nobody gettin' past me.

366
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:17,090
They've got you
in the Ambassador Suite.

367
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:19,158
-Who's that?
-Detective Wyms.

368
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:23,229
Social Services already told me
they're taking me away.

369
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:26,099
I just wanted to know
what happened to your wife.

370
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:30,169
Mona...

371
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:32,505
...ran away.

372
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,608
How long ago?

373
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:36,809
Five...

374
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:38,845
Six years, maybe.

375
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:42,048
No note? No message? No good-bye?

376
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:44,717
No.

377
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:49,188
How do you know she ran away?

378
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,125
Lloyd told me.

379
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,762
What else did Lloyd tell you?

380
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:00,633
-So what kind of work do you do?
-I'm a stylist.

381
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:01,901
Hair?

382
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:03,036
Yeah.

383
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:05,538
-So you could do my hair?
-Yeah.

384
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,108
Cut it off and start over.

385
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:10,910
It's not that bad, is it?

386
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:14,914
-Could do some things.
-Maybe after we get Hector.

387
00:20:15,949 --> 00:20:17,283
Maybe.

388
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:21,554
You know, you could help. Tell me
where Hector's next job's gonna be.

389
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:24,157
-I don't know.
-I believe your brother.

390
00:20:24,157 --> 00:20:27,760
-You, I'm not so sure.
-Why?

391
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,830
He's not afraid of Hector, you are.
Hector's scary.

392
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,932
I deal with shit like
Hector every day.

393
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:34,801
Trust me, he's not as
scary as you think.

394
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,444
He says I'm his.

395
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:46,846
Man, this is fresh.

396
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:50,316
-When did he do that?
-Last night.

397
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:52,885
When I didn't want to let him in
with his stolen smokes.

398
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,793
Looks like they're scoping out
their next job.

399
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:03,696
You know, Lem's feeling pretty down.

400
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,599
Better than lettin'
some asshole shoot me.

401
00:21:12,171 --> 00:21:13,973
What the hell is this?

402
00:21:29,756 --> 00:21:31,090
Lem!

403
00:21:32,225 --> 00:21:34,861
-Yo. You Hector?
-Who are you?

404
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:37,196
Check out this vato here!

405
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:43,536
Why don't you shut up?
Come on!

406
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,972
You like that?

407
00:21:49,042 --> 00:21:50,510
Police!

408
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:53,079
Give me some pavement!

409
00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:00,053
That's for Tigre, asshole!
Now you stay away from her!

410
00:22:00,687 --> 00:22:02,655
-Lem!
-No, man, he branded her!

411
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:05,491
You mess with me and Tigre,
and you're dead, too!

412
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:08,061
You think I'm scared of you, pussy?

413
00:22:08,061 --> 00:22:11,264
Goddamn it! Back off!

414
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:13,666
That's right, bitch ass!

415
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,737
-Goddamn it, man!
-Bitch!

416
00:22:18,304 --> 00:22:21,140
You should've seen what he did to her.
He needed a lesson.

417
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:25,812
They were getting ready for a job.
15 to 20 would've been a great lesson.

418
00:22:25,812 --> 00:22:29,482
Sure was a nice ass-whoopin'.
That's not the point.

419
00:22:29,482 --> 00:22:31,784
Our mission was
to catch Hector red-handed...

420
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:34,687
...bring him in, break him,
lock him up, and stop the jackings.

421
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:37,290
What about getting Chaco off?.
When are we gettin' that gun?

422
00:22:38,491 --> 00:22:39,892
I said tonight.

423
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,763
Now are you protecting the sister
or just getting in my way?

424
00:22:51,738 --> 00:22:53,072
You're back.

425
00:22:53,072 --> 00:22:55,441
I learned some interesting things.

426
00:22:55,441 --> 00:22:56,743
So did I.

427
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,979
You were a classical dancer
when you were a teenager?

428
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:04,517
Okay. My father is now
off-limits to you. Where is he?

429
00:23:04,517 --> 00:23:07,053
-How could you not share that?
-I studied nine months.

430
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:10,389
-In Paris.
-Do your thing and stop stalking me.

431
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:14,260
It's only stalking if you work at it.
Your father just opened right up.

432
00:23:15,762 --> 00:23:18,531
-What exactly is my thing?
-Dig.

433
00:23:18,531 --> 00:23:21,734
On the elderly abuse case?
Elderly murder?

434
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:24,003
The son's cashing
the mother's Social Security checks.

435
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:25,905
Guess what? She's nowhere to be found.

436
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:29,475
If he's treating his father like this,
who knows what he did to the mother.

437
00:23:29,475 --> 00:23:30,610
Interesting.

438
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:33,412
He's got five other kids.
I'm gonna make some calls.

439
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,314
One must know something
about the mother.

440
00:23:35,314 --> 00:23:38,084
I'll search the databases,
see if I can sniff a trail.

441
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:41,754
And your daughter and her fianc?
will be here in a half an hour.

442
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:42,989
What?

443
00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:45,258
Come in.

444
00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:47,994
-You wanted to see me?
-Yes, Danny.

445
00:23:47,994 --> 00:23:49,862
Julien talked to you
about reassignment?

446
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:52,031
I want to talk about
a different matter.

447
00:23:52,565 --> 00:23:53,766
What's that?

448
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,502
I have a friend in administration.

449
00:23:56,502 --> 00:23:59,138
I asked to see the early results
of the sergeant's exam.

450
00:24:01,073 --> 00:24:02,408
Yeah?

451
00:24:02,408 --> 00:24:05,511
You missed the cutoff, Danny,
by three points.

452
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:10,683
-You mean, I failed?
-Three points is nothing.

453
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:13,686
God.

454
00:24:13,686 --> 00:24:16,389
Damn it, I worked hard.
I studied with Dutch.

455
00:24:16,389 --> 00:24:18,357
I even got a good night's sleep.

456
00:24:20,326 --> 00:24:22,862
-If I didn't pass this time...
-You'll pass next time.

457
00:24:22,862 --> 00:24:24,630
You expect me to take it again?

458
00:24:25,031 --> 00:24:26,132
Yeah...

459
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:28,401
...and I expect you to pass it.

460
00:24:50,022 --> 00:24:51,224
Goddamn it.

461
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:56,662
I used to heal Chaco
when he was still bangin'.

462
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:57,864
It feels good.

463
00:24:58,264 --> 00:25:00,333
-Does it?
-Yeah.

464
00:25:03,135 --> 00:25:06,205
-Wish I could've been there.
-Wish I could've done more.

465
00:25:06,205 --> 00:25:09,075
You know, Hector needs
to be locked up, not Chaco.

466
00:25:09,075 --> 00:25:11,043
And what are you doing about that?

467
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:12,812
You gotta have faith in me.

468
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:16,716
We'll see.

469
00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:22,121
Tigre.

470
00:25:22,889 --> 00:25:25,458
There's something that
I have to tell you.

471
00:25:25,458 --> 00:25:26,726
Yeah, what's that?

472
00:25:29,395 --> 00:25:30,563
What?

473
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,698
I shot your brother.

474
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:38,738
-Not the other guy?
-I thought he would kill my boss.

475
00:25:38,738 --> 00:25:42,108
-Did you plant the gun on him?
-Nobody planted a gun.

476
00:25:42,108 --> 00:25:45,344
-I don't want you here!
-You need someone. Hector'll kill you.

477
00:25:45,344 --> 00:25:46,979
I don't want to see your face!

478
00:25:46,979 --> 00:25:50,082
You shot Chaco.
What's to stop me from shootin' you?

479
00:25:50,082 --> 00:25:51,183
Nothing.

480
00:25:51,183 --> 00:25:53,786
You shoot my brother,
then you try to get in my pants?

481
00:25:53,786 --> 00:25:56,589
That's not... Look, I made a mistake.

482
00:25:56,589 --> 00:25:59,458
We're gonna get Chaco off.
I promise you.

483
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:08,935
Come on!

484
00:26:09,702 --> 00:26:11,771
I'm right here, assholes!

485
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:14,674
Punk-ass!

486
00:26:20,613 --> 00:26:23,883
Cacuzza. I was lookin' for you.
I need some help.

487
00:26:23,883 --> 00:26:24,884
What's up?

488
00:26:26,953 --> 00:26:29,989
-You live in the Valley?
-You thinkin' of moving?

489
00:26:29,989 --> 00:26:31,057
Yeah.

490
00:26:31,057 --> 00:26:34,894
-You want to be nearer to me?
-Who wouldn't?

491
00:26:34,894 --> 00:26:36,595
Any suggestions?

492
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,097
Yeah...

493
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:40,199
West Hills, where I live, is nice.

494
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:42,868
There's a West Hills
for rent on the bulletin board.

495
00:26:42,868 --> 00:26:44,937
-Can you take a look?
-Yeah.

496
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:47,039
Thanks.
I'll lock up quick.

497
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:50,676
Hey, Cacuzza.
Sleepin' on the job again?

498
00:26:50,676 --> 00:26:51,944
I'm right here.

499
00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:56,615
I know Ronnie was lookin' for you.
I see you found him.

500
00:26:57,216 --> 00:27:01,754
-Are you pulling a prank on me?
-No. I really want to move.

501
00:27:02,355 --> 00:27:05,624
Right, and a man's just as good
as a vibrator.

502
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:06,993
What are you guys up to?

503
00:27:09,195 --> 00:27:10,463
Nothin'.

504
00:27:11,197 --> 00:27:13,933
Okay. But I'm watching you two.

505
00:27:27,013 --> 00:27:29,883
Excuse me. This is your
father we're talking about.

506
00:27:31,518 --> 00:27:33,553
Thank you very much
for your time then.

507
00:27:34,421 --> 00:27:36,923
Every one of Maynard's kids
hopes he rots in hell.

508
00:27:36,923 --> 00:27:38,525
Have no clue where the mother is.

509
00:27:38,525 --> 00:27:40,460
I ran the wife's maiden name...

510
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,195
...got some hits in Virginia.

511
00:27:42,195 --> 00:27:44,831
It's East Coast time.
Call in the morning.

512
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,469
-Mom?
-Sweetheart.

513
00:27:49,469 --> 00:27:50,637
Hello.

514
00:27:52,772 --> 00:27:55,975
-Mom, this is Warner.
-How do you do, Warner?

515
00:27:55,975 --> 00:27:58,111
I've waited a long time
to meet you, Claudette.

516
00:27:58,778 --> 00:28:02,215
-Couldn't have been that long.
-I'm starving. Can we dine?

517
00:28:02,215 --> 00:28:06,619
There's a diner on the corner.
Claudette loves it there.

518
00:28:14,627 --> 00:28:16,529
Come on.

519
00:28:20,567 --> 00:28:23,236
Warner,
how do you like Los Angeles?

520
00:28:23,236 --> 00:28:24,471
It's big.

521
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:26,739
How did you meet Rebecca?

522
00:28:27,907 --> 00:28:29,709
Parent-teacher conference.

523
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:32,011
She taught my nine-year-old.

524
00:28:32,011 --> 00:28:33,179
She's a great teacher.

525
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,381
Both my boys love her.

526
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:36,749
I see.

527
00:28:37,851 --> 00:28:39,285
You see what?

528
00:28:39,285 --> 00:28:41,054
-Peaches.
-Don't call me that.

529
00:28:41,054 --> 00:28:44,057
I'm just trying to figure out whether
he wants a wife or a baby-sitter.

530
00:28:44,057 --> 00:28:48,027
-I should go back to the hotel.
-No, baby, I'm sorry. Just...

531
00:28:48,528 --> 00:28:51,731
-How can you say that?
-Don't throw away your future.

532
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:53,466
-Gordon loved you.
-We had problems.

533
00:28:53,466 --> 00:28:56,269
-You never gave him a chance.
-You're not giving Warner one.

534
00:28:56,269 --> 00:28:57,537
You knew how I felt.

535
00:28:57,537 --> 00:29:00,773
You think forcing him on me
would make a difference?

536
00:29:00,773 --> 00:29:03,743
Maybe I was crazy to think you'd
want to get to know him.

537
00:29:03,743 --> 00:29:07,146
I thought
you'd try to save your marriage.

538
00:29:07,614 --> 00:29:10,583
At least everyone is finally talking.

539
00:29:14,053 --> 00:29:16,122
Come on. Let's go to dinner.

540
00:29:29,168 --> 00:29:30,737
-Did you get it?
-No.

541
00:29:30,737 --> 00:29:32,338
Goddamn it.

542
00:29:32,338 --> 00:29:33,907
Where is his sister?

543
00:29:33,907 --> 00:29:38,177
Roadside Inn. It's safe. I had to
chase off two of Hector's boys.

544
00:29:38,177 --> 00:29:40,046
What are we gonna do about the gun?

545
00:29:40,046 --> 00:29:42,181
I doubt she'll give us
another chance.

546
00:29:42,181 --> 00:29:45,585
Once it hits central storage,
that place is like Fort Knox.

547
00:29:45,585 --> 00:29:47,620
How bad do you want
to make this right?

548
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,122
Why?

549
00:29:49,122 --> 00:29:52,325
You ever wonder how evidence gets
from here to central storage?

550
00:29:58,765 --> 00:30:01,334
-You're gonna think I'm helpless.
-No.

551
00:30:02,435 --> 00:30:05,204
I was planning on making you
a surprise dinner.

552
00:30:05,204 --> 00:30:07,774
I had the blender, the microwave,
the TV going...

553
00:30:07,774 --> 00:30:09,275
...and the lights went black.

554
00:30:09,275 --> 00:30:10,643
You overloaded the circuit.

555
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:12,612
How do I unload it?

556
00:30:12,612 --> 00:30:15,081
Easy. There's a switch
in the breaker box.

557
00:30:17,417 --> 00:30:20,053
You have no idea
how to do any of this, do you?

558
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:24,490
Maybe you trip my switch?

559
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,681
Who's that?

560
00:30:49,315 --> 00:30:50,583
Danny, hi.

561
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:54,988
-You seeing her?
-Kim? Yeah.

562
00:30:54,988 --> 00:30:58,558
It's new,
but it seems to be going fairly well.

563
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:00,493
-That's great.
-Yeah, so far.

564
00:31:00,493 --> 00:31:02,328
-Dutch?
-Excuse me.

565
00:31:02,328 --> 00:31:03,863
Good for you.

566
00:31:07,066 --> 00:31:08,234
What've you got?

567
00:31:12,105 --> 00:31:14,340
You must feel
good right about now.

568
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,742
I don't know why.

569
00:31:16,109 --> 00:31:18,277
Hasn't it been a little dry lately?

570
00:31:19,178 --> 00:31:21,948
Only in a Death Valley kind of way.

571
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:26,519
It's good you're dating someone.
Even better, she doesn't work here.

572
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:27,854
So, there you are.

573
00:31:28,755 --> 00:31:30,690
What are you doing here?

574
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:32,725
He wanted to see
how we matched fingerprints.

575
00:31:33,693 --> 00:31:36,362
Shouldn't you be
trying to track down our missing mom?

576
00:31:36,796 --> 00:31:39,966
I found someone with her
maiden name in Virginia Beach.

577
00:31:39,966 --> 00:31:42,635
All I have to do
is check the Social Security number.

578
00:31:44,637 --> 00:31:46,839
-And I'll do that now.
-Thank you.

579
00:31:48,741 --> 00:31:51,077
Rebecca's leaving
tomorrow morning.

580
00:31:51,844 --> 00:31:53,746
Have dinner with us tonight.

581
00:31:53,746 --> 00:31:57,050
-And repeat last night's scene?
-I'll referee this time.

582
00:31:59,052 --> 00:32:01,454
There's no fight if I'm not there.

583
00:32:01,454 --> 00:32:04,157
I remember a brilliant
scholar who chose to...

584
00:32:04,157 --> 00:32:06,325
...go into police work
against my advice.

585
00:32:06,325 --> 00:32:08,895
-I wasn't brilliant.
-Yes, you were.

586
00:32:08,895 --> 00:32:10,496
I was mortified.

587
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:12,765
-You still are.
-No.

588
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:14,567
I've come to understand your decision.

589
00:32:14,567 --> 00:32:17,503
When I'm your age,
maybe I'll come to understand hers.

590
00:32:17,503 --> 00:32:18,838
Peaches,...

591
00:32:18,838 --> 00:32:21,607
...I'm 30 years older
and smarter than you.

592
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:23,609
You're not that much smarter.

593
00:32:24,377 --> 00:32:26,079
Maybe a year or two.

594
00:32:28,047 --> 00:32:30,149
-Lowe.
-Yeah.

595
00:32:30,149 --> 00:32:32,585
Johnson's having
a little retirement bash next week.

596
00:32:32,585 --> 00:32:34,454
He's keeping it small, but
there's room for one more.

597
00:32:34,454 --> 00:32:35,455
Want to go?

598
00:32:35,455 --> 00:32:38,925
-No, thanks.
-You'll meet some of the top brass.

599
00:32:38,925 --> 00:32:41,060
-I'm sorry.
-All right, fine.

600
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,463
But if something else comes up,
I'm gonna keep you in the loop.

601
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:45,465
What do you want?

602
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:50,069
You looked out for me.
I'm just trying to return the favor.

603
00:32:50,903 --> 00:32:52,672
I've seen the kind of favors you do.

604
00:32:55,108 --> 00:32:57,110
Let's start out on a new page.

605
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:00,880
You're not my friend...

606
00:33:01,848 --> 00:33:03,316
...so stop pretending.

607
00:33:10,556 --> 00:33:11,524
<i>Hello?</i>

608
00:33:11,524 --> 00:33:13,993
-Is this Mona Gaines?
<i>-Yeah.</i>

609
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:18,498
This is Det. Claudette Wyms.
I'm a detective in Los Angeles.

610
00:33:18,498 --> 00:33:19,766
<i>What's this about?</i>

611
00:33:19,766 --> 00:33:22,068
Were you formerly Mona Hawkins?

612
00:33:23,302 --> 00:33:24,537
<i>What do you want?</i>

613
00:33:24,537 --> 00:33:26,539
Are you aware that
your son is receiving...

614
00:33:26,539 --> 00:33:28,574
...and cashing your Social
Security checks?

615
00:33:28,574 --> 00:33:32,111
<i>I don't care one bit about that,
</i>so long as they don't contact me.

616
00:33:32,111 --> 00:33:36,616
Lloyd's guilty of abusing
Maynard and defrauding the government.

617
00:33:37,383 --> 00:33:40,620
<i>That's not my problem.
</i>Don't call me back.

618
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:45,525
Guess she wasn't murdered.

619
00:33:45,925 --> 00:33:47,727
One hell of a family.

620
00:34:01,941 --> 00:34:05,611
-What do you want, puerco?
-Tell Hector Tigre's mine now.

621
00:34:05,611 --> 00:34:06,846
He's got a problem with that,...

622
00:34:06,846 --> 00:34:09,448
...he can meet me at 11:00, L.A.
River at Whipple.

623
00:34:09,448 --> 00:34:13,653
I'll kick all three of your asses,
all right? No cops, just us.

624
00:34:13,653 --> 00:34:16,222
-Andale, it's on then, homes.
-All right, bitch.

625
00:34:29,468 --> 00:34:31,103
Don't tell me you're
puttin' one there.

626
00:34:31,103 --> 00:34:32,638
I am. What do you need?

627
00:34:32,638 --> 00:34:35,474
Temporary body art,
just like the one I showed you.

628
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:38,711
You're all done.

629
00:34:38,711 --> 00:34:40,046
Let's do it.

630
00:34:41,714 --> 00:34:43,249
Wash your hands first.

631
00:35:41,374 --> 00:35:42,775
Shit!

632
00:35:45,678 --> 00:35:47,513
God, please don't hurt me!

633
00:36:30,757 --> 00:36:33,359
-I said the green car.
-You said the blue.

634
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:36,095
Now I'm saying run the tape
to the green car.

635
00:36:36,095 --> 00:36:37,363
Fine.

636
00:36:40,433 --> 00:36:42,035
What the hell happened here?

637
00:36:42,035 --> 00:36:44,370
The police evidence van
was robbed.

638
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:45,505
Robbed?

639
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:47,507
You gotta be kiddin' me.

640
00:36:49,709 --> 00:36:52,045
-What'd they take?
-A gun.

641
00:36:52,779 --> 00:36:54,747
-That's it?
-Yeah, that's it.

642
00:36:55,849 --> 00:36:58,117
"L.M." stands for "Los Magnificos."

643
00:36:58,117 --> 00:37:00,220
Guess what? It was Chaco's gun.

644
00:37:00,753 --> 00:37:01,955
Goddamn it.

645
00:37:01,955 --> 00:37:03,723
He just bailed out his
senorita's brother.

646
00:37:03,723 --> 00:37:05,291
What are you talkin' about?

647
00:37:05,291 --> 00:37:07,827
Hector Estanza, Los Mags.

648
00:37:07,827 --> 00:37:12,165
The guy Lem shot, Chaco, who's in
the hospital on a weapons charge.

649
00:37:12,165 --> 00:37:14,000
Without the gun, he's gonna walk.

650
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,668
Did you get a good look at them?

651
00:37:15,668 --> 00:37:17,871
Just a weird tattoo
on the ringleader.

652
00:37:17,871 --> 00:37:21,875
What'd it look like?
A snake with wings on it.

653
00:37:21,875 --> 00:37:24,711
That's Hector. You give us the
word, we'll go pick him up.

654
00:37:24,711 --> 00:37:25,979
Go get him.

655
00:37:33,219 --> 00:37:34,687
Hi.

656
00:37:34,687 --> 00:37:37,891
Grandpa said you couldn't have dinner
with us and I wanted to say 'bye.

657
00:37:37,891 --> 00:37:39,058
Still love you.

658
00:37:40,193 --> 00:37:42,695
-Let's just agree to disagree.
-Fine.

659
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:45,598
-Where's the ladies' room?
-lt's right over there.

660
00:37:45,598 --> 00:37:46,766
I'll show you.

661
00:37:48,501 --> 00:37:50,637
This is not your typical
police station.

662
00:37:51,104 --> 00:37:53,373
Bryce was telling me
a little bit about its history.

663
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,441
Care for a tour?

664
00:37:56,175 --> 00:37:58,378
And this
is an interrogation room.

665
00:38:04,584 --> 00:38:05,685
So...

666
00:38:06,553 --> 00:38:08,021
This is where you break 'em.

667
00:38:08,021 --> 00:38:11,291
Suspected rapists,
murderers, child molesters.

668
00:38:11,891 --> 00:38:13,793
We sit 'em all down right there.

669
00:38:16,429 --> 00:38:17,864
Want to see how it feels?

670
00:38:19,933 --> 00:38:21,167
Okay.

671
00:38:31,411 --> 00:38:33,947
-Where's Mom and Warner?
-I don't know.

672
00:38:33,947 --> 00:38:36,583
Are you aware of just how smart
my daughter is?

673
00:38:36,583 --> 00:38:40,587
-Yeah. She's smart as a whip.
-She's smarter than a whip.

674
00:38:41,588 --> 00:38:43,089
That's just an expression.

675
00:38:45,425 --> 00:38:46,759
I do love her, you know.

676
00:38:46,759 --> 00:38:48,695
So, it's not just your
kids who love her?

677
00:38:49,796 --> 00:38:52,432
If my kids hated her,
I'd have trouble deciding who to keep.

678
00:38:52,432 --> 00:38:55,101
Don't make jokes
about giving up your kids.

679
00:38:55,101 --> 00:38:57,470
No, ma'am, I didn't mean it like that.

680
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:59,772
She's a public schoolteacher now...

681
00:38:59,772 --> 00:39:02,442
...but she's got the potential
to go much further.

682
00:39:02,942 --> 00:39:06,813
She plans on getting her doctorate.
She talked about writing a book.

683
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:10,950
I want Rebecca to achieve
everything she wants.

684
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:13,119
You've got all the
right answers today.

685
00:39:14,187 --> 00:39:17,824
But marriage is about having
the right answers every day.

686
00:39:18,891 --> 00:39:21,928
-I'm watching you, Warner.
-Like a hawk...

687
00:39:22,495 --> 00:39:23,630
Ma'am.

688
00:39:45,051 --> 00:39:47,620
-What's up?
-Go ahead!

689
00:39:49,022 --> 00:39:52,525
Get on the ground, scumbag! Freeze!

690
00:39:54,427 --> 00:39:57,163
Hands up! Turn around!

691
00:39:57,163 --> 00:39:58,498
Get on your knees!

692
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:06,172
I gotta say,
I'm a little disappointed.

693
00:40:06,172 --> 00:40:08,841
He doesn't put up a fight
unless you wear a dress.

694
00:40:08,841 --> 00:40:11,277
You're the vatos
that are gonna be disappointed.

695
00:40:11,277 --> 00:40:15,381
-Yeah? How so?
-They'll let me go for no evidence.

696
00:40:15,381 --> 00:40:16,816
Haven't you heard?

697
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:18,951
Heard what, es?

698
00:40:20,787 --> 00:40:24,791
-You robbed a police vehicle today.
-Chal? keep dreaming.

699
00:40:24,791 --> 00:40:27,360
I was at the L.A. River
waiting for that punk-ass.

700
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,995
Man, you must be high.

701
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:32,432
Look what we got here.

702
00:40:33,132 --> 00:40:34,767
Recently fired.

703
00:40:34,767 --> 00:40:36,836
Better hope it doesn't
match the bullets...

704
00:40:36,836 --> 00:40:39,005
...found in the police
van that got robbed.

705
00:40:39,005 --> 00:40:40,273
Yo, it's not mine, homes.

706
00:40:40,273 --> 00:40:42,375
The van had your gang's tag on it.

707
00:40:42,375 --> 00:40:46,312
The cop identified your tattoo.
Ballistics is gonna come back a match.

708
00:40:46,312 --> 00:40:48,347
You vatos set me up!

709
00:40:48,347 --> 00:40:51,384
Like a jury's never
heard that one before.

710
00:40:51,384 --> 00:40:52,752
On your knees.

711
00:40:54,921 --> 00:40:56,889
-On your knees.
-Get down.

712
00:40:57,457 --> 00:40:58,591
Have a seat.

713
00:41:00,126 --> 00:41:03,062
I saw you two bickering
over police tape this afternoon.

714
00:41:03,062 --> 00:41:05,198
-Anything to say?
-He didn't follow orders.

715
00:41:05,198 --> 00:41:08,201
I'm not a mind reader.
If she'd said it, I'd have done it.

716
00:41:08,568 --> 00:41:11,838
If I separate you, you'll just carry
your baggage somewhere else.

717
00:41:11,838 --> 00:41:13,072
I believe in solving problems,...

718
00:41:13,072 --> 00:41:16,142
...not shuffling them around,
so let's identify the problem.

719
00:41:16,142 --> 00:41:17,477
Julien?

720
00:41:17,477 --> 00:41:19,045
Communication.

721
00:41:19,045 --> 00:41:20,079
Trust.

722
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:22,281
Trust comes from communication.

723
00:41:22,982 --> 00:41:26,252
So, how are we gonna fix this?
Department workshop?

724
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:28,488
Maybe I should set you
up with the city shrink.

725
00:41:28,488 --> 00:41:30,156
Any of that sound like fun?

726
00:41:30,857 --> 00:41:32,058
Not really.

727
00:41:32,525 --> 00:41:33,493
Nope.

728
00:41:33,993 --> 00:41:36,529
Prove to me that
you can watch each other's backs...

729
00:41:36,529 --> 00:41:39,132
...and then I'll trust that you
can watch another partner's back.

730
00:41:41,067 --> 00:41:43,035
And don't bother me with this anymore.

731
00:41:44,403 --> 00:41:46,339
So, Dutch, join us.

732
00:41:46,339 --> 00:41:48,441
I think he's got his
own date tonight.

733
00:41:48,441 --> 00:41:49,609
Actually, I do.

734
00:41:49,609 --> 00:41:53,012
-Thanks for showing me around.
-Thanks for telling me about Peaches.

735
00:41:53,012 --> 00:41:54,247
Come on.

736
00:41:55,515 --> 00:41:57,717
So, how did it go with Warner?

737
00:41:57,717 --> 00:42:00,153
I didn't have enough
to make an arrest.

738
00:42:02,588 --> 00:42:03,656
Hey.

739
00:42:05,825 --> 00:42:06,926
Honey?

740
00:42:08,928 --> 00:42:10,229
How's Matthew today?

741
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:14,066
He kept asking where you were,
and I didn't know what to tell him.

742
00:42:15,101 --> 00:42:16,269
I'm sorry.

743
00:42:17,703 --> 00:42:20,573
-How'd it go with the baby-sitter?
-I fired her.

744
00:42:22,041 --> 00:42:23,309
Why?

745
00:42:23,309 --> 00:42:26,345
She created more work.
I had to explain everything to her...

746
00:42:26,345 --> 00:42:29,816
...and she had no idea
how to handle Matthew.

747
00:42:29,816 --> 00:42:32,251
He needs you. We need you.

748
00:42:32,251 --> 00:42:34,487
What am I supposed to do,
quit my job?

749
00:42:34,487 --> 00:42:37,557
Wanting us to be a family
doesn't make me a shrew.

750
00:42:37,557 --> 00:42:40,593
-Something important came up.
-Something always does.

751
00:42:43,029 --> 00:42:44,664
This isn't working.

752
00:42:47,533 --> 00:42:50,703
-What are you talking about?
-Something has to change.

753
00:42:55,775 --> 00:42:58,411
You'll receive good care
at this place, Maynard.

754
00:42:58,411 --> 00:43:00,046
Where's Lloyd?

755
00:43:00,046 --> 00:43:02,415
He's with us. You'll be better off.

756
00:43:03,916 --> 00:43:06,485
Maynard, why do your kids
hate you so much?

757
00:43:09,856 --> 00:43:11,424
I was a bastard.

758
00:43:31,777 --> 00:43:34,113
Too late to change
my mind about dinner?

759
00:43:34,113 --> 00:43:36,716
Actually, I made reservations
for four.

760
00:43:39,986 --> 00:43:41,087
He just lost it.

761
00:43:41,087 --> 00:43:44,257
You want me to believe
that Hector made that gun disappear?

762
00:43:44,257 --> 00:43:45,992
The evidence points to that.

763
00:43:45,992 --> 00:43:48,527
-Hector Estanza?
-Yeah.

764
00:43:49,528 --> 00:43:51,797
-So, Chaco goes free?
-Yeah.

765
00:43:53,399 --> 00:43:55,568
I have you to thank, don't I?

766
00:43:55,568 --> 00:44:00,306
I'm the one who hurt your brother.
I would do anything to take that back.

767
00:44:02,275 --> 00:44:05,344
Yeah, I think I could do something
with this hair.

768
00:44:16,389 --> 00:44:17,857
Look...

769
00:44:19,725 --> 00:44:21,127
Tigre, there's something...

770
00:44:21,127 --> 00:44:24,530
We put the gun in Chaco's hands.
We thought it was Hector.

771
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:27,566
-When I found out who...
-I know.

772
00:44:28,901 --> 00:44:30,403
You made it right.
