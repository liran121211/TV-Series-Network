00:00:01,119 --> 00:00:02,601
<i>Previously on The Shield:</i>

2
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:16,510
What are we doing, Vic?

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,595
Hey, but we had to.

4
00:00:19,361 --> 00:00:21,470
-Christ, come on.
-Enough, come on.

5
00:00:21,561 --> 00:00:24,127
Terry was gonna turn you in,
Vic wanted him dead.

6
00:00:24,218 --> 00:00:25,798
-Vic needed him dead!
-No!

7
00:00:26,978 --> 00:00:28,119
I know.

8
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:32,353
Now, Shane, listen to me.

9
00:00:33,892 --> 00:00:35,869
You're gonna ride this out. Right?

10
00:00:36,681 --> 00:00:39,119
Our fellow officer was
dying in that hospital.

11
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,681
-I said a prayer for him.
-Prayer?

12
00:00:41,772 --> 00:00:43,479
Look, I give you some money,
you skip a couple of tricks.

13
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:44,806
Get yourself some soup.

14
00:00:44,897 --> 00:00:46,369
I don't need your money, Vic.

15
00:00:46,955 --> 00:00:49,267
Here, you look.
Get yourself some soup.

16
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:54,845
Don't worry about me, Vic.
I get by.

17
00:00:56,228 --> 00:00:57,392
Sure?

18
00:01:01,575 --> 00:01:07,318
Okay, come on. Take your seats.
Today is warrant-sweep day.

19
00:01:07,408 --> 00:01:11,086
I know. We all hate sweeps.
We all hate sweeps.

20
00:01:11,176 --> 00:01:14,735
But as long as they've got open
warrants, we've got to serve them.

21
00:01:15,314 --> 00:01:19,635
<i>You've all been assigned several
suspects. Find them. Bring them in.</i>

22
00:01:19,725 --> 00:01:22,533
If you see one of your regulars,
bring them in too.

23
00:01:22,623 --> 00:01:25,235
We've probably got an open warrant
for them as well.

24
00:01:25,626 --> 00:01:27,869
Word on the street
will spread quickly.

25
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:30,117
We've only got three
to four hours.

26
00:01:30,207 --> 00:01:33,053
And listen, these are
the worst of the worst.

27
00:01:33,143 --> 00:01:36,258
So watch out for yourself
and your partner.

28
00:01:36,348 --> 00:01:39,431
<i>That's it. Go find them.</i>

29
00:01:39,521 --> 00:01:41,446
These are all over the place.

30
00:01:41,797 --> 00:01:44,859
Hey, anybody got an Echo Park
for a Koreatown?

31
00:01:44,949 --> 00:01:48,163
Here. But you gotta take
Alvarado Corridor too.

32
00:01:51,248 --> 00:01:55,208
Here. Let me see that. Is that Virgil?

33
00:01:55,298 --> 00:01:59,888
Beautiful. Asshole took a swing at me
last time, in front of some kids.

34
00:02:00,694 --> 00:02:04,036
-I got this one.
-Sarge says you got a visitor.

35
00:02:07,014 --> 00:02:09,927
Police! Freeze, sucker!

36
00:02:17,983 --> 00:02:19,469
What's the matter?

37
00:02:21,897 --> 00:02:23,172
You all right?

38
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,120
-He had a knife.
-The john?

39
00:02:31,655 --> 00:02:33,197
Okay, let me see.

40
00:02:40,678 --> 00:02:43,743
-Jesus.
-He seemed normal, you know?

41
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:47,333
-Yeah.
-Even paid upfront.

42
00:02:47,423 --> 00:02:49,299
I go to put the condom on,
and the asshole...

43
00:02:49,389 --> 00:02:52,030
...he smacks me,
and he tries to rape me.

44
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,372
What?

45
00:02:54,155 --> 00:02:57,297
I know a rape, for chrissake.

46
00:02:59,475 --> 00:03:00,907
All right, what then?

47
00:03:02,772 --> 00:03:05,741
I kicked and scratched
till I got away.

48
00:03:07,998 --> 00:03:10,018
I got some of his licence plate.

49
00:03:13,123 --> 00:03:15,354
I want this prick to hurt.

50
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,420
-Dutch.
-Yeah.

51
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,907
I need a favour.
Connie here had a bad night.

52
00:03:21,997 --> 00:03:25,219
Aceveda dumped a ton of warrants
on my desk. I was wondering...

53
00:03:25,309 --> 00:03:28,990
-You want me to serve them for you?
-No, I'll kick down my own doors.

54
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,041
Can you get her to a hospital,
find out who cut her up?

55
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:36,779
-Sure. Why don't you come with me.
-I'm fine.

56
00:03:36,868 --> 00:03:39,674
We'll get you patched up. You can
tell me what happened on the way.

57
00:03:40,702 --> 00:03:42,850
Go on. I'll check in...

58
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,986
-Are you coming too?
-Yeah, I'll check in on you later.

59
00:03:46,076 --> 00:03:50,160
Hey, Dutchboy, thanks. I owe you one.

60
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:01,230
-Freeze! Police!
-Get down!

61
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,174
Get down!
Get down on the floor right now!

62
00:04:04,264 --> 00:04:06,492
-Hey, remember me?
-Yeah, I remember.

63
00:04:06,582 --> 00:04:08,218
On your face.

64
00:04:09,858 --> 00:04:11,375
-I'll tell you what.
-Hands up.

65
00:04:11,465 --> 00:04:14,445
You tell me when these bracelets
get too tight.

66
00:04:15,444 --> 00:04:17,404
Yeah, just like that.

67
00:04:17,494 --> 00:04:20,822
-Yo, man with the tools.
-Hands up!

68
00:04:20,912 --> 00:04:22,727
Put your hands on your head.

69
00:04:22,817 --> 00:04:25,383
Hands on your head. Get out here.
Come on.

70
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:29,903
-Damn. You're...
-Derrick Tripp.

71
00:04:29,993 --> 00:04:31,572
Derrick Tripp, yeah.

72
00:04:32,678 --> 00:04:35,800
-Jersey's in town to play the Lakers.
-Put your hands back up.

73
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:37,640
You miss the exit
for the Staples Center?

74
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,142
No, man, I'm just chilling.

75
00:04:39,232 --> 00:04:43,815
Yeah, well chilling with cheebas is
a problem here in L.A. Grab some wall.

76
00:04:43,905 --> 00:04:46,394
Come on, man.
It's just a private party.

77
00:04:47,709 --> 00:04:49,288
That's some party favour.

78
00:04:49,378 --> 00:04:52,032
-I got stalkers.
-Is that right?

79
00:04:52,122 --> 00:04:54,338
-You got a permit for this?
-Left it in Jersey.

80
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:57,827
Well, that's a shame.
What are we gonna do about this?

81
00:04:59,405 --> 00:05:01,551
Get those geniuses back down
to the Barn.

82
00:05:01,641 --> 00:05:03,674
-All right, let's go. Get up.
-You stay put.

83
00:05:03,764 --> 00:05:05,242
Let's go have some fun.

84
00:05:11,795 --> 00:05:13,299
Check this out.

85
00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:15,670
It's gonna be a zoo
when we haul this guy in.

86
00:05:16,577 --> 00:05:19,481
-Yeah.
-Never liked him.

87
00:05:19,571 --> 00:05:23,793
-He always gives the Lakers fits.
-Not tonight, he won't.

88
00:05:23,883 --> 00:05:25,529
Yeah? Why is that?

89
00:05:27,232 --> 00:05:30,117
How'd you like to change
the course of sports history?

90
00:05:31,137 --> 00:05:32,620
What do you need it for?

91
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:35,796
We're conducting surveillance
on an apartment across the street.

92
00:05:35,886 --> 00:05:39,515
-How long you gonna be here?
-Out by tonight.

93
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:42,781
-You gonna break anything?
-Don't plan on it.

94
00:05:42,871 --> 00:05:45,204
It's a bitch to collect from the city,
you know?

95
00:05:46,819 --> 00:05:48,339
Here's a deposit.

96
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:53,669
-Drop them in the mailbox.
-Appreciate it.

97
00:05:57,436 --> 00:05:58,668
Come on.

98
00:06:03,936 --> 00:06:05,516
What are we doing here?

99
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:09,860
Keeping you out of the limelight
until we get a handle on this.

100
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,539
Did you do that sneaker
commercial in one take?

101
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:16,202
No way. That was some CGI mojo.

102
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:18,657
One take, all real.

103
00:06:18,747 --> 00:06:20,379
You're the man.

104
00:06:23,561 --> 00:06:27,169
Sponsors ain't gonna be too thrilled
to hear about this.

105
00:06:27,733 --> 00:06:29,614
I got a morals clause
in my contracts.

106
00:06:29,704 --> 00:06:32,736
Let me see if I can help you out.
Give me one minute.

107
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,525
-Hello.
-Hi, there, captain. Vic Mackey here.

108
00:06:40,615 --> 00:06:42,793
-What are you up to now?
-I got a problem.

109
00:06:42,883 --> 00:06:45,701
Just arrested Derrick Tripp
on weapons charges.

110
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:48,483
The basketball player? Exciting.

111
00:06:48,573 --> 00:06:50,825
Right. He's playing against
the Lakers tonight.

112
00:06:50,915 --> 00:06:53,617
We're meeting Matthew's teacher at 7.
Don't forget.

113
00:06:53,707 --> 00:06:54,981
I certainly won't, sir.

114
00:06:55,071 --> 00:06:57,716
Would it help if I dropped off
clothes at work?

115
00:06:57,806 --> 00:06:59,873
-Certainly would.
-Okay, then.

116
00:06:59,963 --> 00:07:02,851
I'll tell him. Lemansky's got
the address.

117
00:07:02,941 --> 00:07:06,054
-Is that it, or should I keep talking?
-That won't be necessary.

118
00:07:06,144 --> 00:07:07,480
I'll see you soon.

119
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:12,235
Captain's a big fan. He'll come down
here and make this thing go away.

120
00:07:12,325 --> 00:07:15,030
-Cool.
-In the meantime, just chill out.

121
00:07:18,913 --> 00:07:20,627
You, you're nuts, man.

122
00:07:20,716 --> 00:07:24,397
Without Tripp's penetration and
outside shot, the Lakers are a lock.

123
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:26,861
Damn, I gotta call my bookie.

124
00:07:39,099 --> 00:07:40,316
You know what I love?

125
00:07:40,406 --> 00:07:44,245
I love what you said to that
ref in game six last year.

126
00:07:44,335 --> 00:07:47,186
I had to say something.
That call was weak.

127
00:07:47,276 --> 00:07:48,659
Looked like a foul to me.

128
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:53,101
Where was you watching it from?
Your 20-inch black-and-white?

129
00:07:53,191 --> 00:07:57,294
Hey. We stopped by Big 5.

130
00:07:58,209 --> 00:08:00,321
How about a couple autographs?

131
00:08:03,326 --> 00:08:05,514
-The captain's on his way, right?
-Any minute now.

132
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,674
I don't usually sign for free.

133
00:08:07,764 --> 00:08:10,286
-You're kidding.
-150 a pop.

134
00:08:10,376 --> 00:08:13,955
-Even little kids?
-People send their kids up to score.

135
00:08:14,045 --> 00:08:16,005
"Derrick, please sign this for me."

136
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:18,716
Then Daddy turns around
and scalps it on the Internet.

137
00:08:18,806 --> 00:08:20,073
Got that.

138
00:08:20,662 --> 00:08:23,041
Derrick, sign this one
for my son, Matt.

139
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:25,486
It's on the up and up.

140
00:08:27,185 --> 00:08:29,159
-Yeah, man.
-Cool.

141
00:08:29,249 --> 00:08:32,832
Fifteen million a year, and you
gotta charge for an autograph?

142
00:08:32,922 --> 00:08:34,689
Wouldn't you say that's weak?

143
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:36,872
The papers print 15 million...

144
00:08:36,962 --> 00:08:40,376
...but after my agent, taxes,
lawyers, publicist...

145
00:08:40,466 --> 00:08:42,984
...and business manager,
15 mil it ain't.

146
00:08:43,074 --> 00:08:46,399
Wow, that's rough.
So, what's that, like 6 million?

147
00:08:47,287 --> 00:08:50,229
-Ain't 15 mil, is it?
-No, it isn't.

148
00:08:56,232 --> 00:08:58,290
So look, I put a call
into Murphy, man.

149
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,836
Spread's six and a half.

150
00:08:59,926 --> 00:09:03,573
Lem and Ronnie are in for a grand
each. I'm in for five. How about you?

151
00:09:03,663 --> 00:09:06,415
-I'll pass.
-Are you kidding?

152
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:08,904
Nobody knows about this.
It's like free money.

153
00:09:08,994 --> 00:09:11,414
The Lakers can clinch home court
for the playoffs.

154
00:09:11,504 --> 00:09:13,341
It's about...
It's not about the money.

155
00:09:13,431 --> 00:09:14,905
Well, it is to this asshole.

156
00:09:14,995 --> 00:09:18,355
Hundred and fifty a pop. I'm surprised
the guy can sign his own name.

157
00:09:18,445 --> 00:09:20,598
-What do you care?
-I don't.

158
00:09:21,459 --> 00:09:23,837
What are we gonna do about
the rest of our warrants?

159
00:09:23,926 --> 00:09:25,482
Already took care of it.

160
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:33,804
Vic Mackey called,
told me to turn myself in.

161
00:09:33,894 --> 00:09:35,790
Line forms over there.

162
00:09:40,427 --> 00:09:42,848
Goddamn warrant sweeps.

163
00:09:43,662 --> 00:09:44,981
Problem, Nathan?

164
00:09:45,873 --> 00:09:48,847
I'm one person doing a two-man job.
Look at this.

165
00:09:48,937 --> 00:09:53,382
I know. Fortunately, I have
my MVP running the show.

166
00:09:53,472 --> 00:09:54,777
MVP?

167
00:09:54,867 --> 00:09:56,570
Most valuable policeman.

168
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:01,014
I wouldn't schedule these sweeps if I
wasn't sure you'd anchor the desk.

169
00:10:01,794 --> 00:10:03,668
You're not gonna let me down, are you?

170
00:10:03,758 --> 00:10:05,225
Of course not, sir.

171
00:10:05,315 --> 00:10:06,895
That's what I wanted to hear.

172
00:10:11,076 --> 00:10:13,904
-Capt. Aceveda?
-Yes.

173
00:10:13,994 --> 00:10:16,307
Marsha Kramer,
attorney for Derrick Tripp.

174
00:10:16,904 --> 00:10:18,324
The basketball player?

175
00:10:19,357 --> 00:10:22,448
No hits on killers raping hookers
at knifepoint.

176
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:24,546
What about the partial plate?

177
00:10:24,636 --> 00:10:28,678
The one our bag-bride scribbled on
her hand while running for her life?

178
00:10:28,768 --> 00:10:32,420
Six hundred matches. I'll have
her look at every single one.

179
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:35,184
Hooker murders are up
for the entire East Side.

180
00:10:35,274 --> 00:10:37,562
Past few show some similarities.

181
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:40,686
You're studying killings
on the entire East Side?

182
00:10:40,776 --> 00:10:44,475
The whole city. You never know
when a disturbing pattern will emerge.

183
00:10:44,565 --> 00:10:47,441
I think I'm witnessing
a disturbing pattern.

184
00:10:48,693 --> 00:10:50,674
I wanna make sure
nothing slips through.

185
00:10:50,764 --> 00:10:53,453
You're just looking for something
big and juicy.

186
00:10:55,466 --> 00:10:58,657
Three months ago, Griffith Park,
beaten with a pipe.

187
00:10:58,747 --> 00:11:02,280
Six weeks ago, Eagle Rock,
strangled by hand.

188
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,960
Two weeks ago, liquor-store dumpster,
choked with a rope.

189
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:09,630
Different locations, different
weapons. Some pattern.

190
00:11:09,719 --> 00:11:11,678
They're all posed facedown.

191
00:11:11,768 --> 00:11:14,198
You're stretching, son. Try yoga.

192
00:11:14,288 --> 00:11:17,979
Connie was supposed to be victim
number four. We need a task force.

193
00:11:18,069 --> 00:11:20,647
You need more evidence than that.

194
00:11:20,737 --> 00:11:22,484
I'm taking it to Aceveda.

195
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,591
All he's gonna do is say no.

196
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,735
No.

197
00:11:31,576 --> 00:11:33,320
Let's find the guy
who attacked Connie,...

198
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:35,275
...try to tie him to
the other murders.

199
00:11:35,365 --> 00:11:37,062
Sounds like a plan.

200
00:11:38,427 --> 00:11:40,662
Please, this is a mistake.

201
00:11:40,752 --> 00:11:42,549
Where have I heard that before?

202
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,524
-Got another one for you, Nathan.
-I see that.

203
00:11:45,614 --> 00:11:48,139
Hey, excuse me, excuse me.

204
00:11:48,229 --> 00:11:51,225
-Haven't I seen you hanging around?
-Step back.

205
00:11:52,255 --> 00:11:53,943
No, I have, haven't I?

206
00:11:54,662 --> 00:11:56,496
Hanging around outside The Abbey.

207
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:01,303
-Abbey?
-You know, West Hollywood.

208
00:12:01,393 --> 00:12:04,538
-How come you never go in? It's fun.
-You've got the wrong guy.

209
00:12:04,628 --> 00:12:06,178
Whatever you say, officer.

210
00:12:06,732 --> 00:12:08,134
Stand back and wait in line.

211
00:12:10,435 --> 00:12:13,531
I told you, he's not here.

212
00:12:14,216 --> 00:12:17,420
I gave you a description.
Why can't Vic take care of this?

213
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:20,305
We're helping you, hon. Keep looking.

214
00:12:24,459 --> 00:12:25,777
Hey, wait.

215
00:12:27,255 --> 00:12:28,606
That's him.

216
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:32,782
-That's the asshole.
-William Greeley.

217
00:12:32,872 --> 00:12:36,604
"Trespassing on federal grounds
as part of an environmental protest.

218
00:12:36,694 --> 00:12:40,045
Three years ago. Charges dismissed."

219
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:42,891
Not exactly a criminal mastermind.
You sure?

220
00:12:42,981 --> 00:12:44,776
Of course I'm sure.

221
00:12:44,866 --> 00:12:46,268
I'll call for a warrant.

222
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:54,366
So you and Vic are...

223
00:12:55,169 --> 00:12:56,474
...friends?

224
00:12:58,568 --> 00:12:59,973
Interesting.

225
00:13:00,662 --> 00:13:04,990
Vic and me have a bond
that transcends sex.

226
00:13:31,426 --> 00:13:32,775
Don't move!

227
00:13:32,865 --> 00:13:34,274
Police! Freeze!

228
00:13:34,809 --> 00:13:36,671
What is this?

229
00:13:37,961 --> 00:13:40,115
-William Greeley.
-Yeah.

230
00:13:43,103 --> 00:13:44,870
Put some clothes on, man.

231
00:13:48,533 --> 00:13:49,901
Bolt cutters!

232
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:53,104
Hey, stay out of there!
You got no right!

233
00:13:58,095 --> 00:14:01,292
You wanna bet on how many heads
he's got icing down in there?

234
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,757
No, thanks.

235
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:22,531
It's not mayonnaise.

236
00:14:24,228 --> 00:14:26,573
You keep away from my children!

237
00:14:27,392 --> 00:14:28,731
No!

238
00:14:32,251 --> 00:14:35,598
Vic? Vic, a word, please.

239
00:14:35,688 --> 00:14:36,997
Sure.

240
00:14:38,095 --> 00:14:40,601
-Who's your friend?
-This is Marsha Kramer...

241
00:14:40,691 --> 00:14:43,107
...an attorney representing
Derrick Tripp.

242
00:14:44,267 --> 00:14:46,812
Mr. Tripp was last seen
in your custody.

243
00:14:46,902 --> 00:14:49,179
We served a warrant
to one of his homeboys.

244
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:51,565
He was there. The drugs weren't his.
He was freed.

245
00:14:51,655 --> 00:14:54,274
He was a good guy,
signed a couple autographs.

246
00:14:55,142 --> 00:14:57,973
-Something wrong?
-Tripp is missing.

247
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,728
-Missing?
-He's not answering his cell phone.

248
00:15:00,818 --> 00:15:04,557
His friends, family, teammates,
management, me...

249
00:15:04,647 --> 00:15:06,748
No one has heard from him.

250
00:15:08,587 --> 00:15:09,688
Weird.

251
00:15:09,778 --> 00:15:13,377
Virgil Lewis said that it looked like
you were taking Mr. Tripp somewhere.

252
00:15:13,467 --> 00:15:17,967
Is this the same Virgil Lewis I busted
sucking on a joint as big as your arm?

253
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,985
I think Virgil's memory might be
a little hazy.

254
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:25,809
I left Tripp a while ago.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

255
00:15:26,337 --> 00:15:29,177
-This is totally unacceptable.
-Vic.

256
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,191
They stitch you up okay?

257
00:15:31,281 --> 00:15:35,448
Between this and my caesarean,
I'm a goddamn road map.

258
00:15:35,538 --> 00:15:38,233
-Jesus Christ.
-Those detectives won't let me leave.

259
00:15:38,908 --> 00:15:40,961
I gotta go see somebody, soon.

260
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:42,303
All right, calm down.

261
00:15:42,393 --> 00:15:45,733
Go back there and chill out. I'll
find out what's going on, all right?

262
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:48,222
Go on.

263
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:50,388
I'd never hurt anyone.

264
00:15:50,478 --> 00:15:53,778
-What kind of work do you do, William?
-I was an actuary.

265
00:15:53,868 --> 00:15:55,341
What about now?

266
00:15:55,431 --> 00:15:57,694
I walked away six months ago.

267
00:15:57,784 --> 00:16:00,548
Needed some time off?
Pressure getting to you?

268
00:16:00,638 --> 00:16:03,888
Well, it's easy to lose your
perspective working every day.

269
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:06,924
What does this have to do
with anything?

270
00:16:07,014 --> 00:16:09,280
What do you do for fun
with that free time?

271
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:14,198
-I have some hobbies.
-I know. Nice sperm collection.

272
00:16:14,288 --> 00:16:15,626
Well, thank you.

273
00:16:18,751 --> 00:16:20,138
Jag?

274
00:16:21,072 --> 00:16:22,494
-Nope.
-Rolls?

275
00:16:22,584 --> 00:16:24,757
Please. Lamborghini.

276
00:16:24,847 --> 00:16:26,965
Sure, that's a sweet ride.

277
00:16:27,055 --> 00:16:29,073
Where the hell's this captain?

278
00:16:29,163 --> 00:16:31,069
Should be here within the hour.

279
00:16:32,103 --> 00:16:33,809
I ain't waiting no hour.

280
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:36,182
Where do you think
you're going, sport?

281
00:16:36,272 --> 00:16:38,791
This captain's kicking
the charges anyway.

282
00:16:38,881 --> 00:16:41,041
I'll leave him will-call tickets
for the game.

283
00:16:41,131 --> 00:16:44,065
-You're staying here.
-See, this meeting's too big.

284
00:16:44,155 --> 00:16:46,679
-I ain't gonna miss it.
-Who's it with?

285
00:16:47,611 --> 00:16:50,166
One of my little L.A. Honeys I bang
when I'm in town.

286
00:16:50,256 --> 00:16:52,780
Maybe she would prefer
conjugal visits.

287
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:55,127
Hey, bring her on down here, man.
There's a bedroom.

288
00:16:56,876 --> 00:16:59,608
What? It'll help pass the time
till the captain shows.

289
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:06,071
If the men's room at Spago's worked
for her, I guess this will do.

290
00:17:06,161 --> 00:17:08,787
-You're a real classy guy.
-Here.

291
00:17:08,877 --> 00:17:11,282
Here, yo, use my cell phone.

292
00:17:13,251 --> 00:17:17,042
-Where were you last night?
-Home.

293
00:17:17,132 --> 00:17:18,971
<i>Anyone vouch for that?</i>

294
00:17:19,061 --> 00:17:21,948
<i>-I live alone.
-You go out?</i>

295
00:17:22,038 --> 00:17:23,507
<i>-Yeah.
-Where?</i>

296
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,780
Well, you know, maybe I didn't go out.
I don't really remember.

297
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:33,659
-Well, which is it, William?
-What about December 15?

298
00:17:33,749 --> 00:17:35,577
Were you out then?

299
00:17:35,667 --> 00:17:38,095
I don't know. Probably at home.

300
00:17:38,185 --> 00:17:42,140
-What about February 5?
-Home.

301
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:46,216
Always home. Filling up those jars
is a full-time gig?

302
00:17:46,306 --> 00:17:47,409
Back to last night...

303
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:51,511
The name Kitty Weir mean anything?
She was a streetwalker on Sunset.

304
00:17:51,601 --> 00:17:53,552
I don't know what you're saying.

305
00:17:53,642 --> 00:17:55,961
-Dutch.
-March 3, Rosita Pedraza...

306
00:17:56,051 --> 00:17:58,291
...on Cesar Chavez.
You killed her too, didn't you?

307
00:17:58,381 --> 00:18:01,920
<i>-Dutch!
-I'd never kill anyone. I'm pro-life.</i>

308
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,850
Jesus Christ.

309
00:18:04,556 --> 00:18:06,007
You're all over the map.

310
00:18:06,097 --> 00:18:08,195
This freak's straight out
of an FBI textbook.

311
00:18:08,285 --> 00:18:10,487
What happened to the original plan?

312
00:18:10,577 --> 00:18:13,399
Nail him for last night's assault,
use it as a building block.

313
00:18:13,489 --> 00:18:17,590
Classic façade of innocence and
charm with bizarre sexual fetishes.

314
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,492
This kind wants to talk.
I have to lead him down the path.

315
00:18:20,582 --> 00:18:22,847
Trust me, his ego won't
let him shut up.

316
00:18:22,937 --> 00:18:27,496
-Could we close this one case, please?
-I mean, Ted Bundy, anyone?

317
00:18:27,586 --> 00:18:30,929
The attack on the hooker comes first.

318
00:18:31,019 --> 00:18:34,039
Dutchboy, I asked you to find
Connie's john...

319
00:18:34,129 --> 00:18:36,676
-...not Jack the Ripper.
-You're observing me?

320
00:18:36,766 --> 00:18:39,614
Fred Astaire never danced
around so much.

321
00:18:40,243 --> 00:18:43,646
-Let me see if I can jog his memory.
-No. You tried that with me once.

322
00:18:43,736 --> 00:18:45,160
Not again.

323
00:18:45,986 --> 00:18:50,486
Now, you asked Dutch for help,
you got it. We'll get the guy.

324
00:18:51,087 --> 00:18:52,621
Don't make me regret it.

325
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:57,074
Don't make me regret it.

326
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,190
Hey, Connie.

327
00:19:02,925 --> 00:19:04,234
They got your guy.

328
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:06,547
You gonna let me watch?

329
00:19:06,637 --> 00:19:09,249
-Watch what?
-You kick the shit out of him.

330
00:19:09,768 --> 00:19:12,039
I think we'll have to settle
for jail time.

331
00:19:12,129 --> 00:19:14,753
I want him to feel the pain I felt.

332
00:19:14,843 --> 00:19:17,942
-Look, why don't you come lie down.
-I can't lie down!

333
00:19:25,011 --> 00:19:28,216
You know what?
I have to get out of here.

334
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:31,175
I have a need, all right?

335
00:19:31,265 --> 00:19:35,597
The detectives need you to stay around
to contradict any statement he makes.

336
00:19:35,687 --> 00:19:39,925
Now stay in here, and I'll take care
of your need. Got it?

337
00:19:40,015 --> 00:19:41,255
Yeah.

338
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:46,361
Just stay here, okay?

339
00:19:52,815 --> 00:19:54,381
Hey, hon.

340
00:19:55,534 --> 00:19:58,514
Hey, little man. There he is.
Come here.

341
00:19:58,604 --> 00:19:59,914
Who was that?

342
00:20:00,487 --> 00:20:02,571
It's a case I'm working on.

343
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,306
Got my clothes?
Thanks.

344
00:20:06,396 --> 00:20:10,335
Hey, Matthew, what a treat
to see Daddy during the day.

345
00:20:10,425 --> 00:20:12,704
Let's hope we get to see him
tonight?

346
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:16,692
-Hope so.
-Hey, I can't miss that.

347
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:19,169
Gotta see little man's teacher
and talk to her.

348
00:20:19,698 --> 00:20:21,705
You know, we've got a play date.

349
00:20:21,795 --> 00:20:23,862
Okay. Thanks for the fresh cape.

350
00:20:23,952 --> 00:20:26,215
Let's go help Mommy outside.
Come on.

351
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,637
Derrick here?

352
00:20:37,727 --> 00:20:39,934
Shane Vendrell.

353
00:20:40,493 --> 00:20:42,260
So he's here or...?

354
00:20:43,438 --> 00:20:44,702
Yeah.

355
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:47,490
Where?

356
00:20:49,618 --> 00:20:51,154
Hey, girl.

357
00:20:51,244 --> 00:20:53,796
God, I missed you.

358
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,424
Save it for Spago's.

359
00:21:00,938 --> 00:21:04,040
When are you gonna get traded
to a West Coast team?

360
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:08,306
I'm here now, ain't I?
Go get the sheets warmed up.

361
00:21:09,243 --> 00:21:10,564
Okay.

362
00:21:12,641 --> 00:21:14,601
-Be right in.
-Okay.

363
00:21:17,727 --> 00:21:21,991
Damn. That is, like, the hottest chick
that's ever been, man.

364
00:21:22,081 --> 00:21:27,080
Her? Please, dog. Adriana's a par.

365
00:21:27,782 --> 00:21:30,849
I got this one in Seattle,
a goddamn birdie.

366
00:21:30,939 --> 00:21:34,503
She's probably spread her legs
for half the league.

367
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:37,120
It's too bad you can't make
a jump shot.

368
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:42,610
Hope y'all got your earplugs.
I'm going in.

369
00:21:45,422 --> 00:21:46,740
He's pretty confident.

370
00:21:47,719 --> 00:21:49,222
I'll be over here.

371
00:21:49,312 --> 00:21:51,432
-O for two.
-How many warrants left?

372
00:21:51,522 --> 00:21:54,326
Counting this no-show, one more.

373
00:22:14,993 --> 00:22:17,026
Neighbour here makes
quite the racket.

374
00:22:34,594 --> 00:22:36,632
She says she's gonna call us
when he gets back.

375
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:38,963
Who's up?

376
00:22:40,571 --> 00:22:42,142
Felipe Tejada.

377
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,321
-Officer.
-What?

378
00:22:53,411 --> 00:22:56,524
I really need your help.
All right, just give me five seconds.

379
00:22:56,614 --> 00:22:57,804
Why?

380
00:22:59,477 --> 00:23:02,472
Look, I'm sorry about
what I said before.

381
00:23:02,562 --> 00:23:04,302
You've got three seconds left.

382
00:23:04,836 --> 00:23:09,223
Okay. I passed a bad check. I paid
the fine. I got a suspended sentence.

383
00:23:09,313 --> 00:23:13,681
This warrant is a mistake. All you
gotta do is call my legal-aide guy.

384
00:23:13,771 --> 00:23:15,775
That would take another five seconds.

385
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:19,894
Please. Look at me.

386
00:23:24,102 --> 00:23:26,032
And now look at the
other guys in here.

387
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:29,036
I'm not supposed to be here.

388
00:23:31,633 --> 00:23:32,908
Stand back.

389
00:23:40,657 --> 00:23:44,941
Gotta be careful with these guys.
They're all a bunch of con men.

390
00:23:45,719 --> 00:23:49,736
This is a nightmare.
I'd never hurt anyone, let alone rape.

391
00:23:49,826 --> 00:23:52,338
I don't even use prostitutes.

392
00:23:52,428 --> 00:23:55,562
I don't have to. Women need me.

393
00:23:55,652 --> 00:23:57,993
-Really?
-Yeah, it's a fact.

394
00:23:58,083 --> 00:23:59,778
Survival of the species.

395
00:23:59,868 --> 00:24:01,573
Meaning what?

396
00:24:01,663 --> 00:24:05,195
Well, men find large
breasts attractive.

397
00:24:05,285 --> 00:24:09,231
They signify that a woman can
amply nourish her young.

398
00:24:09,321 --> 00:24:13,931
Conversely, women respond
to some of my assets.

399
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:18,337
Well, I've seen you butt-naked, son.

400
00:24:19,243 --> 00:24:21,766
-Your assets don't impress.
-No, no, no, no.

401
00:24:21,856 --> 00:24:24,264
You see, penis size is overrated.

402
00:24:24,354 --> 00:24:29,060
I'm talking about my testes,
the true seed of male virility...

403
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:31,998
...the engine that drives the train.

404
00:24:32,899 --> 00:24:36,664
I am packing a pair
you gotta see to believe.

405
00:24:41,149 --> 00:24:44,292
Found an old girlfriend.
Greeley's got a hair-trigger temper...

406
00:24:44,382 --> 00:24:47,955
...and an inoperable brain tumour
driving him schizo.

407
00:24:48,045 --> 00:24:49,888
That explains a few things.

408
00:24:49,978 --> 00:24:52,617
Doesn't explain why he's dumping
the bodies facedown.

409
00:24:52,707 --> 00:24:54,608
Will you forget
about making a name...

410
00:24:54,698 --> 00:24:56,939
...for yourself as a
serial-killer hunter?

411
00:24:57,029 --> 00:25:00,711
We need to corroborate
the hooker story. Period.

412
00:25:00,801 --> 00:25:02,625
He wants to tell us.

413
00:25:08,993 --> 00:25:11,688
-Can't this wait? I'm right out front.
-Yeah?

414
00:25:11,778 --> 00:25:13,956
Yeah, well, listen to this crap.

415
00:25:16,852 --> 00:25:18,434
God.

416
00:25:20,954 --> 00:25:22,634
Any word from the captain?

417
00:25:22,723 --> 00:25:23,852
No.

418
00:25:24,969 --> 00:25:27,644
Call him again. I'm almost done here.

419
00:25:29,266 --> 00:25:30,693
Baby.

420
00:25:32,102 --> 00:25:33,979
The only reason he has
any teeth left is...

421
00:25:34,069 --> 00:25:35,988
...that I'm making a
killing on this thing.

422
00:25:36,078 --> 00:25:38,950
-I upped my bet to 10 grand.
-Later.

423
00:25:42,383 --> 00:25:45,435
Vic? Vic.

424
00:25:45,525 --> 00:25:48,827
<i>No! Give me my Evan!</i>

425
00:25:51,961 --> 00:25:55,334
He's fine! Please! My baby!

426
00:25:55,424 --> 00:25:59,558
-Guy's a crackhead!
-He's dusted! Evan!

427
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:02,845
It's cool. Why don't you give me Evan.

428
00:26:02,935 --> 00:26:06,591
No, he's on fire. He's burning up.
He's red-hot!

429
00:26:06,681 --> 00:26:09,483
He's fine! Please!

430
00:26:09,573 --> 00:26:12,823
-I gotta cool him down!
-I'm a doctor. I can cool Evan down.

431
00:26:12,913 --> 00:26:14,611
You don't look like a doctor.

432
00:26:14,701 --> 00:26:16,885
I get that all the time.
Give him to me.

433
00:26:18,664 --> 00:26:21,195
-My baby!
-No, it's too late!

434
00:26:21,285 --> 00:26:23,405
-Don't do that!
-He's dying!

435
00:26:23,495 --> 00:26:25,762
Don't do that!

436
00:26:25,852 --> 00:26:27,403
Come on, man!

437
00:26:54,532 --> 00:26:55,905
Where's the guy?

438
00:26:55,995 --> 00:26:57,693
He's still under.

439
00:27:06,671 --> 00:27:07,973
Nice save, Vic.

440
00:27:08,063 --> 00:27:11,882
These nut-jobs have a way
of finding me. Be careful.

441
00:27:11,972 --> 00:27:15,904
This one tried to strangle me
on the way over here. Come on.

442
00:27:19,046 --> 00:27:21,258
Vic, I need a piece.

443
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,353
All right, hold on, hold on.

444
00:27:24,475 --> 00:27:26,171
Smoke it by the window.

445
00:27:26,261 --> 00:27:28,574
I can't have my office
reeking of rock.

446
00:27:35,967 --> 00:27:37,674
When am I gonna see you again?

447
00:27:38,639 --> 00:27:39,967
You know the drill.

448
00:27:46,014 --> 00:27:50,484
Just remember, Section 101,
red tank top.

449
00:27:52,358 --> 00:27:54,273
How can I miss that body, right?

450
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,158
-Okay.
-See you at the game.

451
00:28:04,248 --> 00:28:05,607
See you.

452
00:28:06,702 --> 00:28:08,279
See you, Adriana.

453
00:28:11,139 --> 00:28:14,055
-She's a sweet girl.
-Well, boys...

454
00:28:14,483 --> 00:28:17,221
...tell the captain he missed me.

455
00:28:17,311 --> 00:28:20,742
Another booty call?
One of your sponsor's Viagra?

456
00:28:22,147 --> 00:28:23,783
Shoot-around's at 5.

457
00:28:24,218 --> 00:28:26,100
You're not going anywhere, Romeo.

458
00:28:27,046 --> 00:28:30,231
-Get this captain on the phone.
-He's not available by phone.

459
00:28:30,321 --> 00:28:35,033
-You said you called him. Where is he?
-Police business. You'll have to wait.

460
00:28:39,093 --> 00:28:41,465
You been yanking me all day?

461
00:28:41,555 --> 00:28:43,039
Sit down.

462
00:28:43,129 --> 00:28:45,950
Ain't no captain coming, is there?

463
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,912
I said, sit down. You're bugging me.

464
00:28:48,002 --> 00:28:51,208
You got your autographs,
a little peepshow.

465
00:28:51,298 --> 00:28:53,806
Game's over. Colour me gone.

466
00:28:53,896 --> 00:28:56,110
Hey, colour you staying, nigger.

467
00:29:00,827 --> 00:29:02,902
You'd love it if I popped you.

468
00:29:03,983 --> 00:29:06,399
Got your name in the papers
right next to mine.

469
00:29:06,489 --> 00:29:07,777
Come on, come on.

470
00:29:07,867 --> 00:29:10,530
Let's hear what my lawyers
have to say about this.

471
00:29:13,366 --> 00:29:15,339
Badge will look real nice
on my mantelpiece...

472
00:29:15,429 --> 00:29:18,017
...right next to my
Rookie of the Year trophy.

473
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:23,750
-Shane, get off him!
-Come on, come on, come on.

474
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,668
Hey, hey, I said, wait.

475
00:29:25,758 --> 00:29:27,291
Vic, please.

476
00:29:30,202 --> 00:29:31,555
Give me the lighter.

477
00:29:33,046 --> 00:29:34,330
Come on, give it.

478
00:29:40,632 --> 00:29:42,319
Okay, here.

479
00:29:43,392 --> 00:29:44,873
Blow it out the window.

480
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:51,876
Aceveda.

481
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:56,363
The hospital just called.
Baby checked out fine.

482
00:29:56,453 --> 00:29:58,056
-Good job.
-Good.

483
00:29:58,146 --> 00:30:02,390
I am curious. You saved that kid
from the same apartment complex...

484
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,872
-...where Tripp was last seen.
-Crazy?

485
00:30:04,962 --> 00:30:08,118
I lost my wallet during the bust,
went back to look for it.

486
00:30:08,208 --> 00:30:10,335
-Some luck.
-Yeah, you're telling me.

487
00:30:10,425 --> 00:30:12,044
There's no smoking in here.

488
00:30:13,655 --> 00:30:15,064
My mistake.

489
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:18,631
Derrick Tripp's Jersey's
leading scorer.

490
00:30:18,721 --> 00:30:20,527
They'll be hurting without him.

491
00:30:21,452 --> 00:30:22,933
No clue where he is?

492
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:26,217
Come on, captain, you know
how these rich pricks are.

493
00:30:26,307 --> 00:30:29,841
He's probably got his face
snorkel-deep in some broad's snatch.

494
00:30:29,931 --> 00:30:32,676
Give him a few hours,
he'll come up for air.

495
00:30:34,811 --> 00:30:36,692
You know how these celebrities are.

496
00:30:36,782 --> 00:30:41,616
He's probably with a female admirer.
Give it a few hours. He'll turn up.

497
00:30:43,397 --> 00:30:44,700
Step away.

498
00:30:47,499 --> 00:30:49,830
I made some calls.
The warrant was a mistake.

499
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,699
I apologise on behalf
of the department.

500
00:30:54,007 --> 00:30:55,929
See, that wasn't so tough, now,
was it?

501
00:30:56,019 --> 00:30:57,716
Sorry for the inconvenience.

502
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:01,618
The only inconvenience is, I'm leaving
without your phone number.

503
00:31:01,708 --> 00:31:03,988
-Excuse me?
-I just meant so that I could...

504
00:31:04,078 --> 00:31:06,942
...thank you for doing me this favour.

505
00:31:10,179 --> 00:31:12,760
Who knows? Maybe I can return
the favour someday.

506
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:21,425
If so, you know where to find me.

507
00:31:22,147 --> 00:31:26,320
We know about your brain tumour.
No wonder you're angry.

508
00:31:27,413 --> 00:31:28,748
I'm not a killer.

509
00:31:28,838 --> 00:31:31,343
William, tell me more
about your sperm.

510
00:31:31,858 --> 00:31:34,480
So many people waste it.

511
00:31:35,952 --> 00:31:37,439
With condoms...

512
00:31:39,054 --> 00:31:41,636
...masturbating indiscriminately.

513
00:31:44,108 --> 00:31:45,655
It's a holocaust.

514
00:31:46,593 --> 00:31:48,358
So you collect it?

515
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:51,520
My tumour may render me
impotent one day.

516
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:54,032
And with so many women needing me...

517
00:31:54,122 --> 00:31:55,938
You'll still be able
to impregnate them.

518
00:31:56,757 --> 00:32:00,443
I want my essence to be passed
on to the next generation.

519
00:32:00,533 --> 00:32:01,877
Who doesn't?

520
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:04,483
I know I do.

521
00:32:11,421 --> 00:32:13,626
Can you give me a second, sport?

522
00:32:13,716 --> 00:32:16,617
-No.
-It's okay, Dutch.

523
00:32:18,624 --> 00:32:20,084
It's not okay by me.

524
00:32:20,174 --> 00:32:23,840
Come on, buddy.
Help me out here.

525
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,979
We need our privacy.

526
00:32:38,871 --> 00:32:43,484
Have a seat. I didn't see your name...

527
00:32:43,574 --> 00:32:47,356
-...among the sergeant's applicants.
-Well, I've been putting it off.

528
00:32:47,446 --> 00:32:51,459
Don't. If you pass, you'll get
my recommendation.

529
00:32:51,549 --> 00:32:53,288
You'll receive a
post immediately...

530
00:32:53,378 --> 00:32:55,102
...instead of waiting on
a list for months.

531
00:32:55,192 --> 00:32:56,857
Why the big endorsement?

532
00:32:57,715 --> 00:32:59,906
I'd like you in a leadership position.

533
00:33:00,864 --> 00:33:03,206
You mean you'd like to promote
a woman.

534
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,873
It's not how you get there. It's what
you do once you have the chance.

535
00:33:07,963 --> 00:33:11,169
-I'm offering you the chance.
-I'll think about it.

536
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:15,703
So I saw the bad-check writer
was released.

537
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:18,487
For all his whining,
turns out it was a mistake.

538
00:33:18,577 --> 00:33:21,286
But you had to go and check
that out. He got to you.

539
00:33:21,376 --> 00:33:24,362
-No, I just believed him.
-Well, don't make it a habit.

540
00:33:24,452 --> 00:33:27,868
You do favours for these guys,
it comes back to bite you in the ass.

541
00:33:34,668 --> 00:33:35,959
<i>Yeah?</i>

542
00:33:36,645 --> 00:33:39,262
-Ricky Harris?
<i>-Yeah?</i>

543
00:33:39,352 --> 00:33:42,053
Come with us.
We have a warrant for your arrest.

544
00:33:42,143 --> 00:33:43,368
<i>Yes.</i>

545
00:33:43,458 --> 00:33:45,816
<i>No problem. All right?
Just give me a second.</i>

546
00:33:45,906 --> 00:33:47,355
<i>Damn it!</i>

547
00:33:49,285 --> 00:33:51,641
Pull that stuff up.
Get that stuff out.

548
00:33:51,731 --> 00:33:53,523
-Hurry up.
-Is it okay if we come in?

549
00:33:53,613 --> 00:33:55,192
Yeah...

550
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:00,233
You mind if we take a look around?

551
00:34:00,323 --> 00:34:01,995
There's nothing here.

552
00:34:04,614 --> 00:34:06,803
Let me see your hands.
Put them on top of your head.

553
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:12,701
-You got any drugs in here?
-No, I'm clean.

554
00:34:12,791 --> 00:34:14,819
-Who are your buddies?
-Nobody.

555
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:20,038
Come on, look, I'm ready.
Let's just...

556
00:34:20,128 --> 00:34:22,430
Tattoo man, what are you doing
by that couch?

557
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,399
-Just standing.
-Yeah?

558
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:26,731
-Go stand over there.
-I'm not doing anything.

559
00:34:26,821 --> 00:34:29,755
-You heard me. Move.
-I thought you wanted him.

560
00:34:29,845 --> 00:34:33,044
One Tango 13, requesting backup.
30151 l2 Sutter.

561
00:34:33,134 --> 00:34:34,885
Everybody's cool. Let's just go.

562
00:34:34,975 --> 00:34:37,323
Tattoo man, you heard me.
Get over there.

563
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:46,747
Don't you dare move!
I will blow your brains out!

564
00:34:46,837 --> 00:34:50,344
Get on the floor! On your stomachs.
Put your hands behind your head.

565
00:34:50,434 --> 00:34:53,201
Move it. Check the couch.

566
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:55,576
Whatever he's got in there,
I got nothing to do with.

567
00:34:55,666 --> 00:34:56,831
Shut up.

568
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,758
One Tango 13, code three.

569
00:35:06,762 --> 00:35:08,871
What good's your 15 million now,
asshole?

570
00:35:08,961 --> 00:35:11,246
-It's only six take-home.
-Shut up.

571
00:35:12,059 --> 00:35:14,507
-What's going on?
-This guy's totally out of control.

572
00:35:14,597 --> 00:35:17,763
I hope you hate your jobs.
They're about to disappear.

573
00:35:17,853 --> 00:35:19,376
Thinks he's goddamn Shaka Zulu.

574
00:35:19,466 --> 00:35:21,793
When you can fill 20,000 seats
at 200 a pop...

575
00:35:21,883 --> 00:35:23,429
...you'll get the cash and tail.

576
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:26,708
Until then, drag your lily-white ass
back home to Simi Valley.

577
00:35:26,798 --> 00:35:29,163
Hey, I live in Hollywood,
you mother...

578
00:35:29,778 --> 00:35:31,038
Come here.

579
00:35:34,106 --> 00:35:36,198
-Christ, what's the matter with you?
-What?

580
00:35:36,288 --> 00:35:37,556
The guy resisted.

581
00:35:37,646 --> 00:35:39,629
Resisted what? I told
you to babysit...

582
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:41,369
Somebody needs to teach him a lesson.

583
00:35:41,459 --> 00:35:43,368
By doing what? Executing him?

584
00:35:43,848 --> 00:35:47,336
Well, why not?
I mean, isn't that what we do now?

585
00:35:48,051 --> 00:35:50,421
I told you, that's over.

586
00:35:50,511 --> 00:35:53,413
We killed a cop.

587
00:35:55,817 --> 00:36:01,167
Lem and Ronnie failed to clear
the room, and Two-Time killed Terry.

588
00:36:01,762 --> 00:36:04,857
Get over it and don't
bring it up again.

589
00:36:14,281 --> 00:36:15,955
<i>Your partner's very uptight.</i>

590
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:17,995
<i>He overcompensates.</i>

591
00:36:18,085 --> 00:36:21,894
He could learn a lot from you.
You're very maternal.

592
00:36:23,062 --> 00:36:24,797
You have kids, don't you?

593
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:27,613
Two.

594
00:36:28,273 --> 00:36:30,154
-Boys?
-Girls.

595
00:36:30,244 --> 00:36:31,614
I knew that.

596
00:36:34,046 --> 00:36:35,344
They still at home?

597
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:39,489
One's a schoolteacher.

598
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,956
The other's a newspaper reporter.

599
00:36:43,132 --> 00:36:45,844
-You see them much?
-Not as much as I'd like.

600
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:48,530
You ever think about having more?

601
00:36:51,546 --> 00:36:55,616
Well, it would have to be soon.

602
00:36:57,648 --> 00:36:59,830
I'd have to find the right man.

603
00:37:00,796 --> 00:37:02,140
What's he like?

604
00:37:04,577 --> 00:37:08,414
Compassionate, responsible...

605
00:37:10,085 --> 00:37:13,186
-...honest.
-I'm those things.

606
00:37:16,273 --> 00:37:20,284
What if I told you
I could give you a son?

607
00:37:22,624 --> 00:37:24,319
Where were you last night?

608
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:27,696
If I don't spread my seed,
it dies with me.

609
00:37:27,786 --> 00:37:29,404
You found a prostitute?

610
00:37:32,062 --> 00:37:34,149
Come on, Will.

611
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:36,197
If we're gonna make this step...

612
00:37:36,937 --> 00:37:39,201
...you gotta show me that you're...

613
00:37:39,291 --> 00:37:43,298
...the type of man who's gonna take
responsibilities for his actions.

614
00:37:46,656 --> 00:37:48,723
Isn't that what a good father is?

615
00:37:49,421 --> 00:37:52,449
She tried to put a condom on me.

616
00:37:54,109 --> 00:37:56,295
Why would she do that?

617
00:37:57,937 --> 00:37:59,253
So you cut her?

618
00:38:03,288 --> 00:38:05,455
I never had to do that before.

619
00:38:05,545 --> 00:38:06,943
Before?

620
00:38:09,109 --> 00:38:10,707
There were other women?

621
00:38:11,898 --> 00:38:13,178
How many?

622
00:38:17,765 --> 00:38:19,635
I wanna trust you.

623
00:38:25,882 --> 00:38:27,291
You'll make 12.

624
00:38:31,843 --> 00:38:34,062
You raped them to spread your seed?

625
00:38:35,304 --> 00:38:37,942
After they're pregnant,
they'll forgive me.

626
00:38:42,398 --> 00:38:45,057
The prostitutes, did you kill them?

627
00:38:45,147 --> 00:38:47,342
No. God, no.

628
00:38:47,432 --> 00:38:49,631
I spread life, not death.

629
00:38:50,593 --> 00:38:54,275
-Okay.
-So when can you and I consummate?

630
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:57,914
-That's not gonna happen.
-You promised me something.

631
00:38:58,004 --> 00:39:01,742
You may have thought you heard that,
but I didn't say it.

632
00:39:01,832 --> 00:39:04,957
Yes, you did, right here.

633
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:07,601
You promised me a baby.

634
00:39:09,929 --> 00:39:11,995
You give me that xxxxx!

635
00:39:12,085 --> 00:39:13,558
That's mine, damn it!

636
00:39:13,648 --> 00:39:16,549
-Give it to me now!
-Get off me!

637
00:39:19,921 --> 00:39:22,309
My balls.

638
00:39:24,827 --> 00:39:25,950
You all right?

639
00:39:26,929 --> 00:39:28,583
The bigger they are...

640
00:39:35,031 --> 00:39:37,398
-So no serial killer?
-I don't know.

641
00:39:37,488 --> 00:39:39,431
If there is one, it wasn't him.

642
00:39:39,999 --> 00:39:43,325
-Heard about your gun bust. Nice.
-The wait for backup was...

643
00:39:43,415 --> 00:39:45,454
...the longest two minutes in my life.

644
00:39:45,544 --> 00:39:47,995
It always is. Still,
you kept your cool.

645
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:52,418
Aceveda wants me to take
the sergeant's exam.

646
00:39:54,468 --> 00:39:56,484
I suck at tests.

647
00:39:56,574 --> 00:40:00,613
I get so much grief for being a woman
in this place. I can't not pass.

648
00:40:00,703 --> 00:40:03,283
-It's not that hard.
-For you maybe.

649
00:40:04,742 --> 00:40:06,376
Hey, could you tutor me?

650
00:40:07,382 --> 00:40:09,533
I could dust off my old notes.

651
00:40:16,468 --> 00:40:18,657
-All right, get out.
-Get out?

652
00:40:19,062 --> 00:40:20,999
I don't even know where
the hell we are.

653
00:40:21,089 --> 00:40:23,837
-That's your problem.
-You're an asshole.

654
00:40:23,927 --> 00:40:25,666
Yeah? Well, that's my problem.

655
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:28,380
-My lawyers are gonna make sure...
-You're gonna keep your mouth shut.

656
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,294
Your homeys are still in custody.

657
00:40:32,384 --> 00:40:36,525
One visit to the evidence room, and
that ounce of weed becomes a pound.

658
00:40:37,499 --> 00:40:39,533
Play any road games in San Quentin?

659
00:40:40,007 --> 00:40:42,820
-You done with me yet?
-Tell me something.

660
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:47,190
Why would you risk everything,
slumming with those losers?

661
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,885
They was my boys before I made it.

662
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,695
Who else am I supposed to trust now?

663
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,004
The fans?

664
00:40:57,257 --> 00:41:00,019
-You?
-Listen, if they were your boys...

665
00:41:00,109 --> 00:41:02,773
...you'd pull them up instead
of letting them drag you down.

666
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:10,513
Take the subway three stops down
to the Staples Center.

667
00:41:17,632 --> 00:41:19,131
That's Derrick Tripp.

668
00:41:20,695 --> 00:41:22,395
Can I get your autograph?

669
00:41:23,812 --> 00:41:26,469
Isn't that that basketball player?

670
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:28,218
Check him out, man.

671
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:39,693
We certainly hate to lose you, Nathan.
It's the end of an era.

672
00:41:39,783 --> 00:41:43,953
I guess I just lost that edge.
Of course, I'll give two weeks.

673
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:45,570
Not necessary, really.

674
00:41:46,327 --> 00:41:47,868
I need to train my replacement.

675
00:41:47,958 --> 00:41:51,521
I have a system tracking suspects
from processing to the cage that...

676
00:41:51,611 --> 00:41:54,692
Nathan, we'll manage...

677
00:41:57,523 --> 00:41:58,728
...somehow.

678
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:00,807
Hey.

679
00:42:03,742 --> 00:42:05,956
I heard you gave sperm boy
a nice whack.

680
00:42:06,812 --> 00:42:09,016
I could use a good ass-kicker
on my squad.

681
00:42:09,952 --> 00:42:13,257
-Be careful.
-Hey, thanks.

682
00:42:13,695 --> 00:42:16,173
We wouldn't have gotten him
if it weren't for Dutch.

683
00:42:16,263 --> 00:42:18,453
Yeah, but you were the closer.

684
00:42:25,958 --> 00:42:27,119
You all right?

685
00:42:34,083 --> 00:42:35,374
Let's go.

686
00:42:59,367 --> 00:43:00,551
Hi.

687
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:04,940
At the station, you implied
that I was gay.

688
00:43:08,062 --> 00:43:10,615
-Aren't you?
-No.

689
00:43:12,086 --> 00:43:13,375
I'm not.

690
00:43:14,562 --> 00:43:17,194
-I know what you mean.
-You do?

691
00:43:17,976 --> 00:43:19,285
Sure.

692
00:43:20,101 --> 00:43:24,232
I wasn't gay either, until the day
I just admitted that I was.

693
00:43:25,883 --> 00:43:28,996
It's okay. It's okay.

694
00:43:31,648 --> 00:43:32,892
It's safe.

695
00:43:55,203 --> 00:43:56,949
The class loves to paint.

696
00:43:57,039 --> 00:43:59,195
-Cleanup's always the problem.
-I've seen it.

697
00:43:59,285 --> 00:44:01,416
Thanks again for the art supplies.

698
00:44:01,506 --> 00:44:03,519
-I got them on sale.
-The kids had a ball.

699
00:44:03,609 --> 00:44:06,710
Excuse me, we're here
for a reason, right?

700
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,440
Of course. Sit down.

701
00:44:15,803 --> 00:44:20,990
I'm concerned about Matthew.
He's not socializing properly.

702
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,396
He's a little shy.
He'll grow out of it.

703
00:44:23,486 --> 00:44:26,113
I'm afraid it's more
than just being shy.

704
00:44:26,203 --> 00:44:28,542
Matthew's way behind
the other children.

705
00:44:28,632 --> 00:44:31,069
So he's not Michelangelo. So what?

706
00:44:31,159 --> 00:44:34,884
What I'm trying to say is,
I think there's a problem.

707
00:44:34,974 --> 00:44:37,506
-What kind of problem?
-I can't tell you exactly.

708
00:44:37,596 --> 00:44:39,410
Well, who could tell us exactly?

709
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:43,514
I think it's something that
a developmental paediatrician...

710
00:44:43,604 --> 00:44:45,112
...should diagnose.

711
00:44:48,086 --> 00:44:49,793
A neurologist, maybe.

712
00:44:51,242 --> 00:44:53,668
<i>Trampling New Jersey, 101 to 78...</i>

713
00:44:53,758 --> 00:44:55,542
<i>...clinching home-court advantage...</i>

714
00:44:55,632 --> 00:44:57,472
<i>...throughout the playoffs
for the Lak ers.</i>

715
00:44:57,562 --> 00:45:01,942
<i>Kobe Bryant had a game-high
35 points. Shaq chipped in with 29.</i>

716
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:05,513
<i>Derrick Tripp was a no-show
after getting stuck in traffic...</i>

717
00:45:05,603 --> 00:45:10,034
<i>...returning from a charity event.
Only in L.A.</i>
