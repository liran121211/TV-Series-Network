00:00:00,767 --> 00:00:02,402
<i>Previously on The Shield:</i>

2
00:00:02,402 --> 00:00:03,870
Someone slashed your tires?

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,405
Is the real police busy today?

4
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:08,208
-Any idea who might have done this?
-Lamar. He's my ex.

5
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:09,509
Lamar Tilton?

6
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:12,645
We're investigating vandalism to a
car owned by your ex-girlfriend.

7
00:00:12,645 --> 00:00:14,414
You mean the tires I slashed?

8
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:15,682
That's my book.

9
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,951
The reason I have it is because...

10
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:20,220
...Matthew has autism.

11
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,022
That doesn't mean that Vic and
the guy didn't steal those truck.

12
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:25,859
-Without hard evidence...
-I saw them pocket the cocaine.

13
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,027
Most cops here will treat
you like a traitor.

14
00:00:28,027 --> 00:00:30,730
-Are you ready for that kind of heat?
-I'll have to be.

15
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,832
We need to keep this
thing under control.

16
00:00:32,832 --> 00:00:36,436
I'll talk to my people. Make sure
there's no leaks on this end.

17
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:39,105
This is an I.A.D. file of a
current investigation my people...

18
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:40,473
...are tryin' to cover up.

19
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:41,775
Dirty cop?

20
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:44,110
You'll see it gets the
publicity it deserves.

21
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:46,413
Don't worry, David.

22
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:49,115
I'll make sure they spell
your name right.

23
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:54,487
You have an open warrant
for your arrest.

24
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:55,622
Don't worry.

25
00:00:57,056 --> 00:00:59,859
Your boyfriend'll lock up.
Won't you, officer?

26
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:04,931
<i>One-tango-8,
in pursuit of a white, four-door...</i>

27
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:08,368
<i>...failing to yield, traveling
eastbound, approaching Alton.</i>

28
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:11,471
<i>One-tango-2,
we will be secondary in the pursuit.</i>

29
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:16,242
<i>Asking the Sergeant
for permission to take him out here.</i>

30
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:20,914
<i>One-tango-13, in the area,
paralleling the pursuit.</i>

31
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,518
<i>CHP's trying to get a tag strip here.</i>

32
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:28,655
<i>There's cross-traffic.
This is very dangerous.</i>

33
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:32,258
<i>They've stopped. He does not get hit,
goes through that intersection.</i>

34
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,660
<i>There's traffic up ahead.</i>

35
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,695
<i>He's gonna have to take
the wrong side of the road.</i>

36
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:40,967
<i>Julien!</i>

37
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,637
Don't gun it! Too many people!

38
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:46,139
<i>He's back on the wrong side.</i>

39
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:49,442
<i>There's a vehicle!
That was nearly a collision...</i>

40
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:55,782
"Farmington Cops
Investigated for Stealing Drugs"?

41
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:56,883
I was sick when I saw that.

42
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:59,886
The Chief dunked my balls
like doughnuts in his coffee!

43
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:01,588
Do you know how this got out?

44
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:03,623
Yeah! You leaked it!

45
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:04,724
Me?

46
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:07,060
You act like a crusading cop,
bucking the system.

47
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,328
We're all hurt by this.

48
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:11,598
I don't know your agenda, but no one
succeeds here by being anti-cop.

49
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:14,467
I'm anti-criminal,
even if they're wearing a badge.

50
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,402
I must've missed that
quote in the paper.

51
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,939
What will you do about
the Strike Team? Suspend them?

52
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:21,808
What about innocent
till proven guilty?

53
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,444
They can't be on the streets
with these charges pending.

54
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:27,947
And we can't suspend decorated
officers without due process!

55
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:31,017
Reassign the Strike Team
to the general detective pool.

56
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:32,552
Give them different partners.

57
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:35,588
In the meantime, I'll see if I
can figure out who leaked this.

58
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:37,123
Don't bother.

59
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:40,360
You want to pack your things now,
or would you like a few days?

60
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,197
"Firing the One Cop Who Cares about
Cleaning Up the Department."

61
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:47,400
I wonder how the Chief
would like that headline?

62
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:50,370
You got it all figured out, don't you?

63
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:01,180
Howdy, partner.

64
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,916
Slumming with us ordinary detectives?

65
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,051
Don't get too excited.
It's just temporary.

66
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:06,853
Promises, promises.

67
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,721
Looks like we're running
together today.

68
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:11,791
Yeah.

69
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:14,394
<i>There's traffic up ahead.
He's trying to get...</i>

70
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:16,262
<i>North on Hoover.</i>

71
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:18,364
He's coming our way.
Block this intersection.

72
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:25,972
When it's clear, pull out,
cross the street.

73
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:27,941
-Shouldn't I follow?
-No, you're trailing.

74
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,910
Pull up and over, stay parallel.
They'll tell us when to converge.

75
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:45,058
Time to converge.

76
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:51,264
What the hell am I supposed to talk to
Shane Vendrell about all day?

77
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,066
It's good to shake things up.

78
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,768
I don't want to.
I want my partner back.

79
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:59,973
Aren't you sweet?
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.

80
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,476
You're gonna miss me, too, right?

81
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:10,416
I called it in.

82
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:22,829
Danny.

83
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,701
-Roman, pop the trunk.
-Got it.

84
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:33,473
God!

85
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:38,978
God.

86
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,714
Could have used a higher sunscreen.

87
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,084
God!

88
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:58,832
The story's worse than you said.
It's all in there.

89
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:00,133
We're screwed.

90
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,669
Give me till the end of today,
this whole thing goes away.

91
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:05,272
What? We'll have to
make this thing go...

92
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,607
...away.

93
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,776
Heard you guys
found yourselves a crispy critter.

94
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:12,646
It's a miracle he's alive.
Must have had it coming.

95
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:15,949
You got to piss someone off
to be tortured and stuck in a trunk.

96
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:17,551
Nobody deserves that.

97
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,020
He was probably a rat.

98
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:22,289
Back off, Shane!

99
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:24,291
-Cut it out.
-Julien's not a rat.

100
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,860
-They run in packs now?
-What is your problem?

101
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:32,499
Let's not make this into a bigger mess
than it already is!

102
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:34,735
Come on.

103
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:36,403
Come on!

104
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,476
Lay low, man. Do your work.

105
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,978
Leave this thing to me.

106
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:59,226
I'm still here.

107
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,429
-Julien.
-I hear you.

108
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:03,997
You gotta help me out.

109
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:06,099
Nothing I can do.

110
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:07,634
How did that cop know about us?

111
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:08,802
I don't know.

112
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:20,847
I pulled some strings, got you
released until your court date.

113
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:22,849
-You did?
-Yeah.

114
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,585
I just need help with one thing first.

115
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:28,889
I'm filling out my arrest report,
and I'm a little confused.

116
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:32,492
When I busted in, it looked like
you had some cop's xxxx in your mouth.

117
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:36,096
That can't be right, can it?

118
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:38,398
You got something to say,
say it to me.

119
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,733
Okay.

120
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,536
It's easy to make a mistake,
especially on a bust.

121
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:47,774
You think you see someone pocketing
two keys of coke instead of ammo.

122
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:51,311
-It can be confusing.
-He's not confused about anything.

123
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:53,713
I'm not taking back my statement.

124
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:54,915
See?

125
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:59,386
And what you're saying that
he and me did, it never happened.

126
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,823
-It never happened.
-What?

127
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:04,925
Julien. Julien!

128
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:07,994
You heard him. It never happened.

129
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:11,231
-He needs me.
-Aren't you full of yourself?

130
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:13,300
It's over.
That's not what he said!

131
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,336
That's what I say.
He's got a lot on his mind right now.

132
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:18,338
He doesn't need you
complicating things.

133
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:19,573
Stay away.

134
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:21,308
You can't keep us apart.

135
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:22,943
I've seen your sheet.

136
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:26,246
Small time con men like you
only care about themselves.

137
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:27,914
Yeah, well, he cares about me.

138
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:30,317
You don't want me hauling you
in here all the time.

139
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:33,687
That's what you care about,
so cut him off.

140
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:41,628
Man, look at this guy.

141
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:45,265
I ever get that bad,
pull the plug with both hands.

142
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:46,666
Not me.

143
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,502
What? You'd want that?

144
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:50,504
No, but it beats the alternative.

145
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:54,374
Just keep my machines juiced until
the Hoover Dam's out of business.

146
00:07:54,374 --> 00:07:55,408
Detectives?

147
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:58,044
Dr. Crawford,
how's the poor sap doing?

148
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:01,648
Third degree burns over most
of his body? He's gonna die.

149
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:02,883
Here are his things.

150
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:07,888
His skin showed traces of red
phosphorous and hydrogen chloride.

151
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:09,823
He blew himself up in a meth lab.

152
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,391
I see two, three of these a month.

153
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:15,662
Every bozo from here to San
Bernardino thinks he can cook crank.

154
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:18,298
Don't know what you're Boom!

155
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:21,434
Meth, courtesy of Cupid.

156
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:25,906
-How lovely.
-Meth's the drug of the day.

157
00:08:25,906 --> 00:08:28,041
We've got a few ODs
in the ER right now.

158
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,910
Could you take us down
there for a look?

159
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:34,981
-He's tweeking.
-Third one today.

160
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:37,918
-Could I see his belongings?
-Over here.

161
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:42,155
May we see the patient's belongings,
please?

162
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:44,124
Thank you.

163
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:46,760
-Call me if you get more.
-I will.

164
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,328
Cupid's busy.

165
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:52,232
Looks like our mummy cooked up
some crap before blowing himself up.

166
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:55,135
Let's hope he's dumb and lazy.
No telling how much he churned out.

167
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:56,636
Got another college kid.

168
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:02,709
-How do you want to play this?
-We both have our own ways that work.

169
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:05,378
-Why don't we just take turns?
-Take turns?

170
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,914
We follow one lead your way,
follow the next one my way.

171
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:10,016
Your way won't land me in the papers,
will it?

172
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:13,453
-Don't believe everything you read.
-Okay. Who goes first?

173
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:14,721
Ladies go first.

174
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:18,358
All I know is the ID of the driver,
so let's start with his family.

175
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:19,459
Lead the way.

176
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:21,161
-David.
-Jorge.

177
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:25,065
-There's no turning back,
-I know I've burned some bridges.

178
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,100
Now's the time to build some new ones.

179
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,568
How so?

180
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,970
The good news...

181
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:33,540
...this headline is exactly what we
needed to brand you for the voters.

182
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,808
It came out well.

183
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:37,177
I've decided to back
you for City Council.

184
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,413
I was hoping that's
what this was about.

185
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:42,616
Thank you.

186
00:09:42,616 --> 00:09:45,619
I'd like you and Aurora
to join me for dinner tomorrow night.

187
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:46,987
Sereun placer.

188
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:49,256
Bien. Bien. You can meet the
rest of your team then.

189
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:52,425
-I have a team?
-We have a lot of work ahead of us.

190
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,395
The neighborhood celebration
on Cinco de Mayo...

191
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:57,197
...will make a good
coming-out party for you.

192
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:58,765
Jorge?

193
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:02,535
I promise, I'm not in this to lose.

194
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:03,903
You can't afford to.

195
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,542
Don't believe everything you read.

196
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:12,579
You got to wonder
where they come up with this stuff.

197
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:14,981
-Anything break yet?
-Nope.

198
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:20,220
There's a crack den on Temple
due for a toss. You want to hit it?

199
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:24,557
I wish I could, but I've got
to go over some open files.

200
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,026
All righty, then.

201
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:28,995
Danny.

202
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:32,165
How was the sergeant's test?

203
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:35,869
I don't know. It's gonna be close.
I kind of froze a little.

204
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:37,404
I'll bet you did great.

205
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:40,807
Listen, pass or fail, I do want
to thank you for tutoring me.

206
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:43,109
-Can I buy you dinner tomorrow?
-Sure.

207
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:45,245
Great. Tomorrow night.
You pick the place.

208
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:53,653
Can I help you?

209
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,989
Yes. I'm looking for
Detective Gannon.

210
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,692
I've been leaving him messages
for the last two months.

211
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:01,494
Detective Gannon retired last year.

212
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:05,565
He was investigating a case.

213
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:07,767
My husband was murdered.

214
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:12,405
Here. Have a seat.

215
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:13,606
Thank you.

216
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:18,244
I haven't heard anything in ages.

217
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:20,647
I couldn't understand
why he wasn't returning my calls.

218
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:23,249
-What's your husband's name?
-Kyle Kelner.

219
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:26,052
I'll pull the file.
I'll be right back.

220
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:31,858
So you lost your husband.

221
00:11:32,726 --> 00:11:34,160
A year ago today.

222
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:36,363
I'm so sorry.

223
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:38,031
I don't understand.

224
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,233
I mean,
why would Andy run from the police?

225
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:42,469
He had a burn victim in his trunk...

226
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:45,538
...and methamphetamine in his pocket.

227
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:49,075
This doesn't make any sense.

228
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,612
This is from my daughter's
rubber stamp kit.

229
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:54,948
You didn't know your husband
was involved?

230
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:58,318
He's a web page designer,
not a drug dealer.

231
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:01,488
He and his friend Eric
had been looking for jobs...

232
00:12:01,488 --> 00:12:04,290
...ever since the company
they worked for had gone bust.

233
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,525
Who's Eric?

234
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:08,395
Andy and Eric went
to college together.

235
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:11,297
I tried to reach him
when I saw the chase on TV...

236
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:13,366
...but I can't get a
hold of him anywhere.

237
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:16,169
I'm afraid I might know
where to find Eric.

238
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:20,440
I can't even look at him like that.

239
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,942
It was a meth lab explosion.

240
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:24,477
What?

241
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:27,013
Meth lab?

242
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:31,317
I knew that my brother
was having money problems...

243
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:33,653
...but how was I supposed to help him?

244
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:38,024
He's the one who went to college.
Now they're asking me to end his life.

245
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,395
What do I do?

246
00:12:44,664 --> 00:12:47,100
Look, thanks for standing up
for me earlier.

247
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,502
That's what partners do,
even if you don't agree.

248
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:50,737
Don't agree with them?

249
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:54,073
Look, this is a brotherhood.
Everybody here knows that but you.

250
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:55,341
You don't know what
I've been through.

251
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:56,776
You don't tell me.

252
00:12:56,776 --> 00:13:00,046
Decide if you want to stay partners.
If you do, start opening up.

253
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:01,848
If you don't, talk to Aceveda.

254
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:03,249
Car's clean.

255
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:09,956
He already turned me down
when I asked him for a new partner.

256
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,925
Maybe he'll give you
a different answer.

257
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:14,127
There's an unserved warrant.

258
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:17,063
Year-old lottery ticket.
Weight Watchers coupon.

259
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:18,465
Like that lard ass would ever use it.

260
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:21,034
He just dumped
his desk drawer into this box.

261
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:23,403
The clock ran out on
this case a year ago.

262
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:25,972
I'm not shoveling the
ice off the clue trail.

263
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:28,975
-We owe it to her.
-No, Gannon owes her.

264
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,343
You want me to fly solo?

265
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,981
No. Looks like it's the only action
I'm gonna get today.

266
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:35,882
Excuse me?

267
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:38,685
The "I lost my husband
but I'm still young and hot...

268
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:40,954
...and need of an emotional release"
kind of sex?

269
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:42,489
You're kidding, right?

270
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:43,957
What?

271
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:45,959
You've never covered
an accident or homicide...

272
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:48,394
...and gone back a month later
for a statement?

273
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:52,465
This one's been hanging
on the vine for a year.

274
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:54,167
She is ripe.

275
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:04,043
Just give me two minutes, Fran!

276
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:06,446
She say you only last two minutes!

277
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:08,982
About as long as it'll take me
to whup your ass!

278
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,386
I'm telling you what!
Why you wanna go there?

279
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:15,255
Wait a minute. You guys again?

280
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:19,058
Weren't you with you, and we
busted you for slashing his tires?

281
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:20,093
Man, that was in the past!

282
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:22,462
Today you need to arrest him
for trespassing!

283
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:25,732
You got to own something
for me to trespass, welfare nigger!

284
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:29,802
-My job is getting nasty with Fran.
-Fran, don't do this!

285
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:31,704
We together now! What you want?

286
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,306
Let me talk!
Give me two minutes, girl!

287
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:35,942
-You don't have two.
-Then give me one minute!

288
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:38,878
-We're through, Hooper!
-Fran, don't do this!

289
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,713
She won't give you the time of day.

290
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:44,484
-Stop! He don't deserve you, girl!
-Get on inside. Come on.

291
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:46,719
Come on, now! Don't do this, baby!

292
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:47,954
Querida?

293
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:50,723
I'm finishing the marketing plan.

294
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,625
It has to be done before
I fly to Houston.

295
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:53,793
Don't think you're getting any.

296
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:56,296
Is that any way to talk
to the next City Councilman?

297
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,932
My God. Machado said yes?

298
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:01,568
We're having dinner
tomorrow night to meet the team.

299
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:03,937
The team? David!

300
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,406
I can't believe it.

301
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:08,942
Why aren't you more excited?

302
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:11,311
This is my shot.

303
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:13,980
-I won't get another.
-You won't need another.

304
00:15:15,882 --> 00:15:18,484
Power is an aphrodisiac.

305
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:22,956
Died about 20 minutes ago.
Second, so far.

306
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:26,726
Third one scrambled his brains.
And all from the same college.

307
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:29,362
We better find this stuff,
or you'll be stacking them higher.

308
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:30,930
Ambulances bring them in?

309
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,999
-All but that one.
-Who brought him?

310
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,234
That guy over there.

311
00:15:39,706 --> 00:15:42,875
Police. You knew the OD victim?

312
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:46,112
He was rushing my frat.
I'm the Pledge Master.

313
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:48,147
This part of Rush Week?

314
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:53,987
-My father's a lawyer.
-Mine was a bricklayer. So what?

315
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:58,224
Fowler, Kaufman and Rose.
You want to talk to me, talk to them.

316
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,528
We are definitely doing
this one my way.

317
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:06,666
Get the hell off me!

318
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,703
-You wanted him to be your brother?
-Yeah.

319
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:12,572
-Kiss your brother.
-Stop that!

320
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:14,607
-Where'd he get the meth?
-Please, no!

321
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:16,643
-Where'd he get it?
-I don't know!

322
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:18,645
Fine! Kiss your brother again!

323
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,613
We gave it to all the pledges!

324
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:23,516
It was supposed to be funny,
sending them to class on speed!

325
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:25,551
-Jesus!
-Where'd you get it from?

326
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:26,853
Effi!

327
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:28,855
Effi Montecito!

328
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:31,024
He deals to all the frats.

329
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:32,759
Good.

330
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:35,728
Now let me show you
how we haze our pledges.

331
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:42,702
Detective Gannon left
a long list of TBIs.

332
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,871
"To be interviewed."

333
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:47,507
So we're starting from scratch.

334
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:50,410
What exactly was your
husband's business?

335
00:16:50,944 --> 00:16:52,512
Property management.

336
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:55,148
He owned condos, rented them out.

337
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:58,385
And he was found at a
construction site?

338
00:16:58,918 --> 00:17:02,022
Yeah. He and his partner Ari
were building a new complex.

339
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:03,590
Was he meeting someone?

340
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:06,893
I don't know.

341
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:10,397
I had just gotten home from my
parents' when the police called.

342
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,468
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

343
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:17,737
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

344
00:17:18,505 --> 00:17:20,674
Look, I'll get you some chips.

345
00:17:20,674 --> 00:17:21,708
Thanks.

346
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:28,415
Have you talked to anyone,
like a grief counselor?

347
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:29,716
Didn't help.

348
00:17:30,283 --> 00:17:32,385
I know some that are very good.

349
00:17:32,952 --> 00:17:35,088
I don't know.
It's already been a year.

350
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:39,225
I'm sure it feels like it was
yesterday when you got that call.

351
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:44,631
Our dealer Effi's a 25-year-old
still living in his old frat house.

352
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:47,567
-Can't seem to grow up.
-He'll grow up fast in San Quentin.

353
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:48,768
Real fast.

354
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:51,504
It'll take a few hours
to get the warrant. I'll start.

355
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:54,074
Not a problem.
I got some errands to run, anyway.

356
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:05,285
What's going on? This IAD thing's
still hanging out there.

357
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:07,520
I told you. I'm not
changing my statement.

358
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,888
I'm willing to keep your secret.

359
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:10,957
-Sure, you are.
-I am!

360
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:13,293
What do you think,
I want to twist your arm?

361
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:15,128
-All you got to do is...
-Lie?

362
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:17,397
It's not a lie. You made a mistake.

363
00:18:17,397 --> 00:18:19,999
We put boxes of ammo in that bag,
not bricks of coke.

364
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:23,370
I know what ammo looks like,
and blackmail, too.

365
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:26,139
It's not gonna work.
I got nothing to lose.

366
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:29,309
My guys have taken fire
from every scumbag in town.

367
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:32,312
They're going down because some rookie
thinks he saw something?

368
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:34,280
I did see something.

369
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:37,484
I'm not gonna let you
destroy their lives.

370
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:39,152
So you're gonna try and destroy mine?

371
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,188
You're not giving me any choice.

372
00:18:42,756 --> 00:18:45,525
Handing in this arrest report's
the only way I can stop you...

373
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:46,926
...from making a huge mistake.

374
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:48,428
That report doesn't prove anything.

375
00:18:50,897 --> 00:18:53,233
I don't have to prove you're gay.

376
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:56,369
In this house,
all I got to do is say it...

377
00:18:57,103 --> 00:18:59,139
...and all the gory details.

378
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:22,228
-There you go.
-All right.

379
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:27,400
Vic!

380
00:19:33,807 --> 00:19:35,942
I'm not sure they stole any drugs.

381
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:37,410
What?

382
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:40,713
It was dark. They were at the other
end. My view was obstructed.

383
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:43,049
You never said your
view was obstructed.

384
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:44,751
It was.

385
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:48,354
You didn't see Mackey put bricks
of cocaine into a weapons bag?

386
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:50,089
I can't be positive.

387
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:52,725
You didn't see Shane Vendrell
drive off with that bag?

388
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:54,627
I don't know for sure what was in it.

389
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:56,429
-Mackey got to you.
-No.

390
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:58,598
He threatened you.
We can get him for that.

391
00:19:58,598 --> 00:19:59,699
He didn't.

392
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:02,035
Then what?

393
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:04,804
Maybe I let his reputation
cloud my judgment.

394
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:08,308
Question. "Are you positive
it was two kilos of cocaine?"

395
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:10,210
Answer. "Yes. "

396
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,978
I'm not sure anymore.

397
00:20:11,978 --> 00:20:15,081
Julien, failure to
report corruption...

398
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:18,485
...and giving false testimony
are both serious offenses.

399
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:24,657
I'll accept whatever
punishment I have to.

400
00:20:26,326 --> 00:20:27,927
Sorry to disappoint you.

401
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:46,646
Yeah!

402
00:20:47,347 --> 00:20:48,815
I told you it would go away.

403
00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:51,317
-How'd you get him to back off?
-I reasoned with the man.

404
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:53,086
You are my personal hero.

405
00:20:56,222 --> 00:20:57,290
Get out.

406
00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:00,126
Sure, boss.
I got a big case I'm working.

407
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:08,234
-What did you do to him?
-To who?

408
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:09,702
Officer Lowe.

409
00:21:09,702 --> 00:21:11,771
Nothing. Is he okay?

410
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:15,341
He changed his statement.
IAD hasn't notified me.

411
00:21:19,012 --> 00:21:20,980
If anything happens to him...

412
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,916
Can't see why it would.

413
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:25,952
Listen, I got to run.
I'm touring a school for my kid.

414
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:31,024
Sorry your headlines got screwed up.

415
00:21:39,065 --> 00:21:41,501
-What now?
-Look at this.

416
00:21:43,336 --> 00:21:44,470
"Hoe"?

417
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:47,473
Goddamn bastard
call her that for everybody to see.

418
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:49,075
How do you know Hooper did this?

419
00:21:49,075 --> 00:21:51,177
Hooper's not a very good speller.

420
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:55,748
Look it over. Sign right there.

421
00:21:55,748 --> 00:21:58,985
-So he can't come within 10 feet?
-That's a restraining order.

422
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:01,354
-This complaint can justify it.
-What if he comes near me?

423
00:22:01,354 --> 00:22:04,357
Then I'll make him my bitch.
Now sign it.

424
00:22:04,357 --> 00:22:07,727
-Sometimes I see him at the Vons.
-Vons? What Vons?

425
00:22:07,727 --> 00:22:08,728
He helps with my shopping.

426
00:22:08,728 --> 00:22:11,030
Helps you with your shopping?
Hell, no!

427
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,532
That stops right here!

428
00:22:12,532 --> 00:22:14,467
Back off. Just let her
think it through.

429
00:22:14,467 --> 00:22:15,702
She don't need to think.

430
00:22:15,702 --> 00:22:17,437
-She needs to sign it!
-Okay.

431
00:22:18,237 --> 00:22:19,606
It's all good.

432
00:22:21,074 --> 00:22:24,277
So you were Kyle Kelner's
business partner.

433
00:22:24,277 --> 00:22:25,578
Until he died.

434
00:22:25,912 --> 00:22:28,047
Where were you on the night he died?

435
00:22:28,648 --> 00:22:32,151
I told the detective last year.
I was in Phoenix on business.

436
00:22:32,151 --> 00:22:34,988
Why are you just getting around
to Kyle's murder now?

437
00:22:34,988 --> 00:22:38,324
Unfortunately, the file
slipped through a crack in the system.

438
00:22:38,324 --> 00:22:39,892
Judging from
today's newspaper,...

439
00:22:39,892 --> 00:22:42,228
...I'm surprised any crack
slips past you guys.

440
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:46,032
Those are just allegations.

441
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:49,435
Sure. Got to stick up for your own.
I understand.

442
00:22:51,137 --> 00:22:52,605
He got along with everyone.

443
00:22:52,605 --> 00:22:55,775
Nice, funny, a great boss, you know?

444
00:22:55,775 --> 00:22:57,610
Wish I could find
another one like him.

445
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:00,046
I haven't had a decent
job since he died.

446
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,949
Must be real tough on you.

447
00:23:02,949 --> 00:23:04,884
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

448
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:09,288
It's times like this when you need
someone to lean on...

449
00:23:09,288 --> 00:23:12,425
...like a husband or boyfriend.

450
00:23:12,425 --> 00:23:13,793
I'm single.

451
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:19,766
Our specialized care is made to meet
the needs of autistic children...

452
00:23:19,766 --> 00:23:22,568
...including speech,
occupational, behavior therapies.

453
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:24,303
The facilities are really nice.

454
00:23:24,303 --> 00:23:27,373
I read that if you put a kid
with other autistic kids...

455
00:23:27,373 --> 00:23:31,144
...it keeps them from socializing,
sort of lowering the bar.

456
00:23:31,144 --> 00:23:32,679
Some people think that...

457
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:35,314
...but we've seen that autistic
children progress best...

458
00:23:35,314 --> 00:23:37,717
...in a small class
with other kids their own level.

459
00:23:37,717 --> 00:23:41,487
How does this compare with the
public schools? The pilot programs?

460
00:23:41,487 --> 00:23:44,524
You risk Matthew being put
in a typical class with an aide.

461
00:23:44,524 --> 00:23:45,825
What's wrong with that?

462
00:23:45,825 --> 00:23:48,494
Throwing him in the pool
won't teach him to swim.

463
00:23:48,494 --> 00:23:52,131
Here, Matthew will be a leader,
he'll gain more confidence.

464
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:54,734
So he won't be behind anymore.

465
00:23:54,734 --> 00:23:57,503
We have one spot available.
It's sure to go quickly.

466
00:23:57,503 --> 00:23:59,639
$25,000 is pretty steep.

467
00:23:59,639 --> 00:24:01,941
Our services aren't cheap...

468
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:03,176
...but you ask any
of the parents here,...

469
00:24:03,176 --> 00:24:04,243
...they'll tell you it's worth it.

470
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:05,878
It seems wonderful.

471
00:24:05,878 --> 00:24:09,048
I know it's an important decision,
but I suggest you make it quickly.

472
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:10,249
Excuse me.

473
00:24:13,886 --> 00:24:16,222
-Julien.
-Reverend, why are you here?

474
00:24:16,222 --> 00:24:18,291
Your captain said
you were struggling...

475
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:20,660
...with a decision and need
spiritual guidance.

476
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,628
For some reason,
thought I might be able to help.

477
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:25,264
Come on. Police stations
make me nervous. I need a smoke.

478
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,902
I went back on my statement
because I'm not sure what I saw.

479
00:24:29,902 --> 00:24:32,071
Why did you sign it
in the first place?

480
00:24:32,705 --> 00:24:35,641
I don't know.
Too eager to do the right thing?

481
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:36,909
I overreacted.

482
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:40,012
I know an overreactor when I see one.
That's not you.

483
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,482
What's going on, Julien?

484
00:24:44,884 --> 00:24:48,521
What do you do when the man that you
are isn't the man that you want to be?

485
00:24:48,521 --> 00:24:51,324
Give the man
that you are a kick in the ass.

486
00:24:52,258 --> 00:24:53,359
What's stopping you?

487
00:24:55,895 --> 00:24:58,231
Nothing. I'll be all right.

488
00:24:59,365 --> 00:25:02,702
Only thing better than
unfiltered smoke...

489
00:25:02,702 --> 00:25:04,337
...unfiltered prayer.

490
00:25:05,037 --> 00:25:08,808
Just you and God, no secrets...

491
00:25:08,808 --> 00:25:10,343
...nothing in between.

492
00:25:11,911 --> 00:25:13,246
See you Sunday?

493
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,748
Yeah.

494
00:25:20,286 --> 00:25:21,654
<i>Okay, come on, boys.</i>

495
00:25:24,257 --> 00:25:27,026
<i>Of course.
You want to go in there unprotected?</i>

496
00:25:28,895 --> 00:25:31,898
<i>-Let's go, ladies. Who's up?
</i>-Are you serious?

497
00:25:31,898 --> 00:25:33,599
<i>Tim, you just volunteered.</i>

498
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:39,539
Who's that?

499
00:25:41,941 --> 00:25:44,110
-Who the hell are you?
-Decency police.

500
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,913
Let me guess, Effi Montecito?

501
00:25:46,913 --> 00:25:49,448
-Yeah.
-You're coming with us.

502
00:25:49,448 --> 00:25:50,750
What?

503
00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:57,156
-This one we do my way.
-If you feel we have time for that.

504
00:26:00,026 --> 00:26:02,361
I thought screwing sheep
went out with New Wave.

505
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:04,597
-We wouldn't really make them do it.
-Right.

506
00:26:04,597 --> 00:26:06,199
We just wanted to see who would.

507
00:26:06,199 --> 00:26:09,502
Wait, you dragged
my son here for a schoolboy prank?

508
00:26:09,502 --> 00:26:12,238
Your son's here
on suspicion of drug trafficking.

509
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,907
-What?
-Dad, it's not true.

510
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:17,777
So far, three students
at Mission Cross Hospital...

511
00:26:17,777 --> 00:26:20,580
...have died from your
Cupid crystal meth.

512
00:26:21,514 --> 00:26:23,015
That wasn't mine.

513
00:26:23,015 --> 00:26:26,319
Apparently he supplies half
of fraternity row.

514
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:28,955
We have to get his latest batch
off the street before more kids die.

515
00:26:28,955 --> 00:26:31,090
You're dealing drugs again?

516
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,758
Dad, they can't prove anything.

517
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:35,094
You're 25 years old!

518
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:38,264
Grow up, will you?
You stupid son of a bitch!

519
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:40,566
-What the hell's the matter with you?
-Stop!

520
00:26:40,566 --> 00:26:42,468
Your stuff has killed somebody!

521
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,242
Guard!

522
00:26:49,242 --> 00:26:51,210
You know
what you're doing to your family?

523
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,479
Go on! Let them take you!

524
00:26:53,479 --> 00:26:56,148
Go on, you stupid piece of shit!

525
00:26:56,148 --> 00:26:59,118
You see if I'm gonna
bail you out this time!

526
00:27:02,755 --> 00:27:04,690
I like doing things your way.

527
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:11,398
I told them to take the
life support away.

528
00:27:11,398 --> 00:27:14,801
Son, I don't mean
to be disingenuous, but I'm sorry.

529
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:19,105
-What's disingenuous mean?
-Means you're under arrest.

530
00:27:19,105 --> 00:27:22,375
-For what?
-For shaking and baking crystal meth.

531
00:27:22,375 --> 00:27:24,010
I don't know anything about that.

532
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:25,679
We talked to Effi.

533
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,947
He rolled on you, you roll on him.

534
00:27:28,615 --> 00:27:32,352
Eric was mixing up a batch,
and it exploded...

535
00:27:32,352 --> 00:27:35,588
...and he was screaming.
His flesh was...

536
00:27:36,589 --> 00:27:38,858
We couldn't take him to the hospital.

537
00:27:38,858 --> 00:27:40,760
So you tossed him in the trunk.

538
00:27:41,261 --> 00:27:43,530
Andy was gonna bury him in the desert.

539
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:45,165
He was still alive.

540
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:48,401
We thought that he would die
by the time that we got there.

541
00:27:48,401 --> 00:27:50,670
Exactly how stupid are you?

542
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:53,807
You're six credits shy of graduating
for the last four years.

543
00:27:53,807 --> 00:27:56,076
You're a drug dealer
who spends his free time...

544
00:27:56,076 --> 00:27:59,112
...watching pledges hump sheep,
and he's the stupid one?

545
00:27:59,112 --> 00:28:01,414
Any more bad crank still out there?

546
00:28:01,414 --> 00:28:04,050
Only the stuff that Manny's
holding for collateral.

547
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:05,418
Who's Manny?

548
00:28:06,052 --> 00:28:08,922
He's who we borrowed
the money from to start the meth lab.

549
00:28:09,322 --> 00:28:13,393
When we couldn't pay right away,
he smashed up my hand...

550
00:28:13,393 --> 00:28:15,895
...and he took half of
the drugs as collateral.

551
00:28:15,895 --> 00:28:17,330
How much is half?

552
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:18,465
10 pounds.

553
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:22,602
There's still 10 pounds
of this shit out there?

554
00:28:23,703 --> 00:28:24,804
Goddamn it.

555
00:28:24,804 --> 00:28:28,675
If he hadn't of threatened us, Eric
wouldn't have rushed the last batch...

556
00:28:28,675 --> 00:28:30,076
...and he would still be alive.

557
00:28:30,076 --> 00:28:31,878
Who is this Manny guy?

558
00:28:32,379 --> 00:28:33,713
Manny Sandoval.

559
00:28:34,214 --> 00:28:37,150
Manny Sandoval skated
two murders I should have had him for.

560
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,852
I've wanted this bastard for a year.

561
00:28:38,852 --> 00:28:41,020
If he's so bad,
how come I never heard of him?

562
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,757
Supercop,
you know every criminal on the street?

563
00:28:43,757 --> 00:28:45,692
After we catch this guy, I will.

564
00:28:45,692 --> 00:28:49,129
You want me to give you $20,000?

565
00:28:49,129 --> 00:28:50,430
You can't be serious.

566
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:52,832
That's what our meth
men owe this Manny.

567
00:28:52,832 --> 00:28:55,135
They're both willing to wear a wire.

568
00:28:55,135 --> 00:28:57,837
Nail him at the drop,
get the bad dope out of circulation.

569
00:28:57,837 --> 00:29:01,007
Stop. You're under investigation
for stealing drugs.

570
00:29:01,007 --> 00:29:04,244
-I should give you cash?
-Don't give it to Vic.

571
00:29:04,244 --> 00:29:07,113
Give it to me so we
can save some lives.

572
00:29:09,315 --> 00:29:10,683
When do you need it?

573
00:29:10,683 --> 00:29:11,885
Tomorrow.

574
00:29:11,885 --> 00:29:15,755
So long as we're clear,
I'm giving the money to you.

575
00:29:19,793 --> 00:29:21,895
Hi. I'm sorry to bother you.

576
00:29:21,895 --> 00:29:23,830
I tried to call,
but the phone's disconnected.

577
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,064
Yeah.

578
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:30,336
-Is everything okay?
-Yeah. I just, forgot to pay the bill.

579
00:29:30,336 --> 00:29:32,472
But it'll be on in a
couple of days, so...

580
00:29:32,972 --> 00:29:34,240
No problem.

581
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,810
I need to check on one thing,
and I'll be out of your hair.

582
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:39,312
Did your husband
have business ties to Phoenix?

583
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,915
I don't think so.

584
00:29:41,915 --> 00:29:44,350
I know Ari has family there.

585
00:29:44,884 --> 00:29:45,919
Your husband's partner?

586
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:49,289
Yeah. He was visiting them
the night that Kyle was killed.

587
00:29:51,991 --> 00:29:54,327
I called one of those
grief counselors you recommended.

588
00:29:54,327 --> 00:29:55,795
Yeah?

589
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:57,597
Have an appointment on Tuesday.

590
00:29:58,598 --> 00:30:00,834
Good. I'm glad.

591
00:30:03,002 --> 00:30:05,972
-Thank you.
-Detective, do you have to...

592
00:30:08,741 --> 00:30:10,210
Thanks...

593
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:11,878
...for taking care of this.

594
00:30:12,612 --> 00:30:13,847
Thanks.

595
00:30:13,847 --> 00:30:15,148
My pleasure.

596
00:30:15,615 --> 00:30:16,683
Good night.

597
00:30:18,051 --> 00:30:19,152
'Bye.

598
00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:23,223
I called the Reverend Cook
because I was worried.

599
00:30:23,223 --> 00:30:25,592
-I know this is tough.
-You shouldn't have.

600
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:28,328
I don't know what
Mackey did or said...

601
00:30:28,895 --> 00:30:32,332
...but I know it took fortitude
to come forward in the first place.

602
00:30:33,099 --> 00:30:36,302
-Where's that fortitude now?
-I made a mistake.

603
00:30:36,302 --> 00:30:37,604
Yes, you have and...

604
00:30:38,338 --> 00:30:41,674
-...I want to help you rectify it.
-I don't want your help.

605
00:30:42,942 --> 00:30:45,445
You should contact your PBA rep.

606
00:30:46,145 --> 00:30:49,415
You're facing suspension,
probably termination.

607
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:52,519
I wish you'd gone
down a different way.

608
00:30:57,757 --> 00:31:00,026
We can skip the trip
to Lake Powell this year.

609
00:31:00,026 --> 00:31:03,396
I can go back to work at the ER,
pick up some shifts per diem.

610
00:31:03,396 --> 00:31:05,932
And spend half
the money you make on day care.

611
00:31:05,932 --> 00:31:07,133
We'll lose that spot.

612
00:31:07,133 --> 00:31:10,169
He'll go to school in the real world,
learn to socialize.

613
00:31:10,169 --> 00:31:13,673
I want him in Glenridge.
He'll be happy there. I know it.

614
00:31:13,673 --> 00:31:15,275
You know it, too.

615
00:31:16,676 --> 00:31:19,579
All right. Call them tomorrow.

616
00:31:19,579 --> 00:31:21,214
I'll have to pick up extra shifts.

617
00:31:21,214 --> 00:31:22,615
We barely see you enough now.

618
00:31:22,615 --> 00:31:27,086
-What do you want from me?
-I'm not mad. We just miss you.

619
00:31:27,787 --> 00:31:30,223
Matthew ruined my notebook.

620
00:31:30,223 --> 00:31:31,591
Let me see.

621
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:35,595
You know what?
We'll get you a new one, okay?

622
00:31:35,595 --> 00:31:39,699
Why does he do stuff like that?
He never listens.

623
00:31:39,699 --> 00:31:43,069
Matthew listens. He just
understands things differently.

624
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:44,304
Come here.

625
00:31:45,004 --> 00:31:47,640
See how you make your
letters so neat...

626
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,676
...get them to fit inside the lines?

627
00:31:49,676 --> 00:31:50,977
Yeah.

628
00:31:50,977 --> 00:31:52,545
Matthew...

629
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:58,551
...he doesn't know how
to make things fit.

630
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:01,688
He needs help with that kind of stuff.

631
00:32:03,089 --> 00:32:04,691
Big sister help?

632
00:32:05,425 --> 00:32:09,462
Yeah. Big sister help. Come here.

633
00:32:10,563 --> 00:32:11,965
Big sister help.

634
00:32:11,965 --> 00:32:13,199
It'll be okay.

635
00:32:13,199 --> 00:32:15,501
It's not okay. You don't deserve this.

636
00:32:15,501 --> 00:32:17,904
So much for riding that headline
onto the City Council.

637
00:32:17,904 --> 00:32:20,406
-You're more than just that headline.
-Not to Machado.

638
00:32:21,274 --> 00:32:23,843
When he hears that the
case fell apart...

639
00:32:23,843 --> 00:32:25,945
If he backs out, what
happens to your job?

640
00:32:25,945 --> 00:32:27,146
Gilroy's getting squeezed.

641
00:32:27,146 --> 00:32:29,716
First chance he gets,
he's gonna take it out on me.

642
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:32,952
There's got to be
something you can do.

643
00:32:32,952 --> 00:32:34,287
I can't think of what.

644
00:32:34,988 --> 00:32:36,856
I really thought this was my shot.

645
00:32:39,258 --> 00:32:40,793
I'm so sorry.

646
00:32:45,331 --> 00:32:48,267
I knew twice in one day
was too much to hope for.

647
00:32:52,038 --> 00:32:53,239
"Shoe"?

648
00:32:56,075 --> 00:32:57,744
What are you doing here?

649
00:32:57,744 --> 00:32:59,612
I told you, I only
needed two minutes.

650
00:32:59,612 --> 00:33:01,447
He bumped into me at the Vons.

651
00:33:02,482 --> 00:33:03,716
Who painted that "S"?

652
00:33:03,716 --> 00:33:07,854
I couldn't scrub off "hoe," so I
figured that was the next best thing.

653
00:33:07,854 --> 00:33:11,090
-Why are we here?
-Lamar slashed my tires again.

654
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:12,425
He gets jealous.

655
00:33:12,425 --> 00:33:15,194
I want my name
off that restraining order...

656
00:33:15,194 --> 00:33:16,729
...and put Lamar's name on there.

657
00:33:16,729 --> 00:33:20,033
-Not gonna be a problem, is it?
-You, come with me.

658
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:26,506
We hooked up at the Vons!

659
00:33:27,707 --> 00:33:30,176
Apparently,
these guys will do anything for you.

660
00:33:30,176 --> 00:33:32,478
They're serious,
and you're leading them on.

661
00:33:32,478 --> 00:33:33,613
I am not.

662
00:33:33,613 --> 00:33:36,249
Yeah, you are.
Now stop stringing them along.

663
00:33:36,249 --> 00:33:38,284
Just pick one and stick with him.

664
00:33:38,851 --> 00:33:40,319
It's the right thing to do.

665
00:33:41,087 --> 00:33:42,689
Go to Phoenix often, Ari?

666
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:44,724
Sometimes.

667
00:33:44,724 --> 00:33:46,859
Who did you meet
the night that Kyle was killed?

668
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:48,728
A business acquaintance.

669
00:33:48,728 --> 00:33:50,263
Did you have dinner?

670
00:33:50,263 --> 00:33:53,599
No, I got in around 9:30.
We had drinks.

671
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,069
Did you get a chance
to see your family?

672
00:33:58,471 --> 00:33:59,706
Family?

673
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,842
No, not that trip.

674
00:34:02,842 --> 00:34:06,112
9:30. So, you were on the 8:00 flight?

675
00:34:06,112 --> 00:34:07,113
Exactly.

676
00:34:07,113 --> 00:34:09,182
I checked the flight manifests.

677
00:34:09,182 --> 00:34:10,883
Your flight flew out at 10:00.

678
00:34:12,051 --> 00:34:14,020
You want to tell me something, Ari?

679
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:19,292
You did it, ass wipe! Say it!

680
00:34:19,292 --> 00:34:21,527
Yes, I killed him!

681
00:34:21,527 --> 00:34:22,962
I didn't plan it!

682
00:34:22,962 --> 00:34:26,265
He just found out I was stealing money
from our joint account.

683
00:34:26,265 --> 00:34:30,169
He accused me.
I got scared, and I just killed him.

684
00:34:30,169 --> 00:34:32,739
I didn't have a plan.
I didn't have an alibi.

685
00:34:33,206 --> 00:34:35,608
Why didn't you guys
arrest me last year?

686
00:34:39,779 --> 00:34:43,216
That rocked! Man, you set him up...

687
00:34:43,216 --> 00:34:45,017
...I knocked him down.

688
00:34:45,017 --> 00:34:48,755
Yeah. You are great.

689
00:34:50,356 --> 00:34:53,993
Don't you just once wish you
worked for Beverly Hills P.D.?

690
00:34:53,993 --> 00:34:55,862
I'll bet you their wires work.

691
00:34:55,862 --> 00:34:57,964
You don't like the WWII hand-me-downs?

692
00:34:57,964 --> 00:35:01,367
<i>-You guys still owe me $20...
-The lab exploded.</i>

693
00:35:01,367 --> 00:35:03,469
<i>Not my problem.
</i>You want the drugs?

694
00:35:05,671 --> 00:35:07,740
<i>-30 percent.
</i>-Damn. Did he say it?

695
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:08,875
I can't hear.

696
00:35:11,611 --> 00:35:14,514
<i>-Your brother blew up...
</i>-'Cause of you, son of a bitch!

697
00:35:14,514 --> 00:35:17,250
<i>Stop, you goddamn crazy kid! My eye!</i>

698
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:18,718
<i>He'd still be alive...</i>

699
00:35:19,952 --> 00:35:22,421
What is this, is this a bug?

700
00:35:23,489 --> 00:35:26,559
You taping me, bitch? You taping me?

701
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:28,594
-I'm gonna kill you.
-Drop it!

702
00:35:28,594 --> 00:35:30,329
Don't make me kill you!

703
00:35:33,966 --> 00:35:36,803
Self-defense, man!
Crazy bastard was trying to kill me!

704
00:35:36,803 --> 00:35:39,572
Paul just attacked him.
He ruined everything.

705
00:35:39,572 --> 00:35:42,141
-I told you, he's stupid.
-He killed Eric!

706
00:35:42,141 --> 00:35:44,243
Okay, he killed my brother!

707
00:35:44,243 --> 00:35:46,112
This doesn't screw up
my deal, does it?

708
00:35:48,147 --> 00:35:50,783
Your informant attacks me
while working a case for you?

709
00:35:50,783 --> 00:35:52,685
My lawyer will buy a
new home off of this.

710
00:35:52,685 --> 00:35:55,855
-You were ready to kill Paul!
-But I didn't.

711
00:35:55,855 --> 00:35:57,724
And even if I did,
it was self-defense.

712
00:35:57,724 --> 00:35:59,726
Why don't we let a
jury sort that out?

713
00:36:01,327 --> 00:36:03,263
Some kids croaked on meth, right?

714
00:36:03,763 --> 00:36:06,666
You put me behind bars,
not only won't those charges stick...

715
00:36:06,666 --> 00:36:09,235
...there's a good chance
that stuff gets on the street.

716
00:36:09,235 --> 00:36:10,937
You sick bastard.

717
00:36:11,804 --> 00:36:13,273
Only when I have to be.

718
00:36:14,374 --> 00:36:16,342
We gonna help each other out, or what?

719
00:36:19,712 --> 00:36:21,514
Why would Ari kill him?

720
00:36:21,514 --> 00:36:23,983
He was siphoning off money
from the business.

721
00:36:23,983 --> 00:36:26,920
Kyle caught him red-handed.
He was gonna blow the whistle.

722
00:36:33,293 --> 00:36:36,963
-Thank you, detectives.
-Don't mention it. It's our job.

723
00:36:38,898 --> 00:36:42,001
I'll check in on you in a few weeks,
just to make sure you're doing okay.

724
00:36:44,537 --> 00:36:48,575
I hope you keep that appointment.
This is a lot to take in, I know.

725
00:36:49,042 --> 00:36:51,311
I thought I'd be okay,
knowing what happened.

726
00:36:51,978 --> 00:36:53,613
It doesn't make it any better.

727
00:36:54,347 --> 00:36:55,982
It doesn't change anything.

728
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:02,155
He's still not gonna be there
when I get home, is he?

729
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:05,892
I just don't want to be alone anymore.

730
00:37:07,994 --> 00:37:13,199
Listen, Danny, I know this is short
notice, but I have to break our...

731
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:15,702
Cancel our dinner tonight.

732
00:37:15,702 --> 00:37:16,869
Everything all right?

733
00:37:16,869 --> 00:37:19,572
Yeah. A friend of
mine's having a crisis.

734
00:37:19,572 --> 00:37:20,840
It's no problem.

735
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,908
I'm really sorry.

736
00:37:21,908 --> 00:37:24,410
I'll just work a double.
I can use the extra cash.

737
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:26,446
Great. We'll do it soon.

738
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,082
They swept the whole area.

739
00:37:29,082 --> 00:37:31,584
Garbage cans, dumpsters,
crawl spaces, nothing.

740
00:37:31,584 --> 00:37:33,820
-What about his place?
-No cupid in sight.

741
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,888
Ten pounds of junk is out there.

742
00:37:35,888 --> 00:37:38,691
Enough to kill dozens,
and he's holding all the cards.

743
00:37:38,691 --> 00:37:41,527
This might be a good time
for us to start doing things my way.

744
00:37:41,527 --> 00:37:43,863
And what way would that be, exactly?

745
00:37:43,863 --> 00:37:46,232
Captain. Didn't see you there.

746
00:37:46,232 --> 00:37:48,267
Someone should put a bell
around your neck.

747
00:37:49,602 --> 00:37:53,539
-Where are we with this meth thing?
-Between a rock and a hard place.

748
00:37:53,539 --> 00:37:56,109
Looks like we're
gonna have to do this Manny's way.

749
00:37:57,644 --> 00:37:59,812
The drugs were
right where you said they'd be.

750
00:37:59,812 --> 00:38:01,080
Lucky guess.

751
00:38:03,983 --> 00:38:06,152
You're welcome for the public service.

752
00:38:10,023 --> 00:38:12,058
Pleasure doing business with you.

753
00:38:12,058 --> 00:38:14,227
You picked the right day
to cross paths with me.

754
00:38:14,227 --> 00:38:16,796
-I was handcuffed.
-You guys got a lot of rules.

755
00:38:16,796 --> 00:38:18,131
You know something?

756
00:38:18,931 --> 00:38:20,499
You might not have
pulled any triggers...

757
00:38:20,499 --> 00:38:23,136
...but a lot of people
are dead because of you.

758
00:38:23,136 --> 00:38:25,705
-You're on my radar now.
-Okay.

759
00:38:27,473 --> 00:38:28,941
Trust me...

760
00:38:29,475 --> 00:38:31,210
...that's not a good thing.

761
00:38:32,078 --> 00:38:35,048
Just have fun tonight.
They're all dying to meet you.

762
00:38:35,048 --> 00:38:36,516
That's why I'm here.

763
00:38:36,949 --> 00:38:39,852
It kills me, Jorge,
but this whole thing fell apart.

764
00:38:39,852 --> 00:38:43,890
The key witness got cold feet.
The investigation's dead.

765
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:45,625
I wanted you to hear it from me.

766
00:38:47,894 --> 00:38:49,228
That's not ideal.

767
00:38:50,897 --> 00:38:55,501
But it's not disaster, either.
David, people remember the headlines.

768
00:38:55,501 --> 00:38:58,204
Most times,
they don't even read past them.

769
00:38:59,272 --> 00:39:02,375
-This being politics...
-Perception is reality.

770
00:39:02,375 --> 00:39:03,910
Learning fast.

771
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:07,113
Don't worry about it,
I live up to my promises.

772
00:39:07,113 --> 00:39:10,616
You're my man. Get used to it.
I see you at 8:00.

773
00:39:13,219 --> 00:39:15,288
How'd things go with Mackey today?

774
00:39:15,288 --> 00:39:17,323
-Fine.
-Good.

775
00:39:19,325 --> 00:39:21,728
I missed you, too, okay? You happy?

776
00:39:22,795 --> 00:39:24,063
It doesn't matter to me.

777
00:39:25,264 --> 00:39:26,699
How was your day?

778
00:39:27,433 --> 00:39:30,069
Shane wants to hit
the monster truck rally on Friday.

779
00:39:42,582 --> 00:39:46,185
Got to stop meeting like this.
People are gonna talk.

780
00:39:46,919 --> 00:39:49,355
Not about anything they heard from me.

781
00:39:49,856 --> 00:39:51,023
Hey.

782
00:39:51,457 --> 00:39:52,825
It might not feel like it...

783
00:39:53,326 --> 00:39:55,361
...but you did the
right thing yesterday.

784
00:39:56,095 --> 00:39:57,597
I'm not gay.

785
00:39:58,164 --> 00:40:00,600
-Julien, come on.
-I'm not.

786
00:40:02,802 --> 00:40:06,572
It's this thing inside of me.

787
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:12,078
I push it down, it goes away
but then it comes back stronger.

788
00:40:13,112 --> 00:40:15,448
I shove it down again,
but it just keeps on coming back...

789
00:40:15,448 --> 00:40:18,017
...till I don't
have the strength to push anymore.

790
00:40:20,353 --> 00:40:21,454
God.

791
00:40:23,456 --> 00:40:25,191
I am so weak.

792
00:40:26,926 --> 00:40:29,428
I hate this thing inside of me.

793
00:40:31,464 --> 00:40:32,732
Julien.

794
00:40:34,467 --> 00:40:37,303
You can't go through life
hating who you are.

795
00:40:37,837 --> 00:40:39,338
I pushed away everyone...

796
00:40:40,006 --> 00:40:42,475
...my partner, my reverend, Tomas.

797
00:40:43,442 --> 00:40:45,044
I'm alone.

798
00:40:45,044 --> 00:40:46,712
No, you're not.

799
00:40:48,981 --> 00:40:50,449
You were there for me.

800
00:40:51,551 --> 00:40:52,952
I'm there for you.

801
00:41:00,626 --> 00:41:03,362
It is so nice
to have someone else cook dinner.

802
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:05,798
It smells incredible.

803
00:41:06,365 --> 00:41:07,667
Thanks.

804
00:41:08,167 --> 00:41:11,571
One of the keys is basil.

805
00:41:11,571 --> 00:41:13,806
You have to add it
just before it's done,...

806
00:41:13,806 --> 00:41:15,341
...otherwise you'll cook
the flavor out of it.

807
00:41:16,108 --> 00:41:18,511
-We wouldn't want to do that.
-No.

808
00:41:20,479 --> 00:41:21,914
Strainer?

809
00:41:29,622 --> 00:41:32,191
Today has been very emotional for you.

810
00:41:32,191 --> 00:41:36,195
There's a lot of delayed grief...

811
00:41:36,195 --> 00:41:39,699
...pent up confusion,
misplaced feelings.

812
00:41:39,699 --> 00:41:41,934
I'm not gonna take advantage of that.

813
00:41:44,337 --> 00:41:45,671
You wouldn't be.

814
00:41:55,781 --> 00:41:58,284
-Hey.
-What's up?

815
00:41:58,751 --> 00:42:00,786
This whole IAD thing...

816
00:42:01,454 --> 00:42:04,757
I shut you out.
Looks like I was wrong.

817
00:42:04,757 --> 00:42:06,592
This thing confused a lot of people.

818
00:42:06,592 --> 00:42:09,061
Yeah, I know.
It killed my partnership.

819
00:42:09,061 --> 00:42:12,598
It's not too late. He's a good kid.

820
00:42:12,598 --> 00:42:15,401
Maybe he deserves a second chance.

821
00:42:15,401 --> 00:42:16,836
Most of us do.

822
00:42:23,676 --> 00:42:25,378
-I'll see you.
-Right.

823
00:42:27,446 --> 00:42:28,781
-Sir.
-Danny.

824
00:42:29,715 --> 00:42:32,518
The Strike Team's back in business,
effective tomorrow.

825
00:42:32,518 --> 00:42:35,721
-Did you ever have any doubt?
-I did this time.

826
00:42:42,395 --> 00:42:43,796
I'm tired, Vic.

827
00:42:44,597 --> 00:42:48,901
I just can't keep explaining these
messes or cleaning up after them.

828
00:42:48,901 --> 00:42:49,902
Ben.

829
00:42:50,503 --> 00:42:52,538
I'm not gonna let myself get burned.

830
00:42:53,172 --> 00:42:54,473
We're done, Vic.

831
00:42:59,512 --> 00:43:01,747
I just can't have your back anymore.

832
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:08,154
I thought I owed it
to you to tell you.
