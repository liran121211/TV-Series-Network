1
00:00:00,734 --> 00:00:02,302
<i>Previously on The Shield:</i>

2
00:00:02,302 --> 00:00:05,238
For the next 24 hours,
she's your one and only case.

3
00:00:05,238 --> 00:00:08,708
Prostitute, aged 12 to 14,
had a sweet tooth.

4
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:11,111
The guy who murdered Sally
is still out there...

5
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:13,279
...and I'm standing here
with my xxxx in my hand...

6
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:15,648
...because this guy
thought it'll be funny...

7
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:17,751
...to trip his buddy over the coals.
Didn't you?

8
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:21,187
You're very lucky. Matthew is a
charming and intelligent little boy.

9
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:22,689
He also has autism.

10
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:24,557
Autism?

11
00:00:24,557 --> 00:00:27,060
I don't think I can sell
a cop to these voters.

12
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,963
Wht would think a man
who exposed corruption?

13
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:32,532
Brought down dirty cops
from inside the department?

14
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:35,268
I'd think he was committing
professional suicide.

15
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:37,237
But couldn't you sell him
to the voters?

16
00:00:37,737 --> 00:00:38,938
Absolutely.

17
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:43,977
Bag it.

18
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:50,116
I wanna know what you
found in the Navigator.

19
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:53,153
Isn't a stolen car case only
a little below your radar?

20
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:54,421
Where are the drugs?

21
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:55,789
I saw them pocket the cocaine.

22
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:57,357
I told you to let this go.

23
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:59,759
I may have to answer to you,
but I also have to answer to God.

24
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:02,095
Most cops here will treat
you like a traitor.

25
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:04,597
You're gonna take more shit
than you've ever taken before.

26
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:06,166
Are you ready for that kind of heat?

27
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,601
I'll have to be.

28
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:29,549
You done already?

29
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:44,063
I need someone to listen to me.

30
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:46,566
I'm busy. Maybe one
of the uniforms...

31
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:48,701
I said I need someone
to listen to me.

32
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:51,971
Okay.

33
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:59,178
Did you wanna report a crime?

34
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:05,652
I've lost track of all the crimes.

35
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,123
-I don't understand...
-I've lived here all my life...

36
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:13,426
...keeping my complaints
to myself. But no more.

37
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,797
My apartment has been broken into
seven times in the last four years.

38
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:21,334
Seven times.
And you never catch anyone!

39
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:27,106
You have got graffiti and cuss words
on every single wall that you see!

40
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:31,844
I've got needles on my sidewalk,
beer cans on my lawn...

41
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:35,014
...and I stopped ducking at
the sound of gunshot years ago.

42
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:39,786
We can drop smart bombs
down chimneys half a world away.

43
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:44,190
But some sicko gets released from jail
because of a computer screwup...

44
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,992
...and rapes my niece.

45
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,335
How does this make sense?

46
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:04,277
I see yellow police tape
everywhere that I go.

47
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:08,581
And it's all sirens and helicopters
and searchlights.

48
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,984
You've got mothers
killing their children,...

49
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:15,221
...children killing strangers, maniacs
flying airplanes into buildings...

50
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:18,358
...and I just want life to go back
to the way that it should have been.

51
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:29,168
What are you doing
to make us feel safe?

52
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:46,620
I love the action, but what
are we doing in Watts?

53
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,724
We got eight people dead.
Nine, if you count the foetus.

54
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:55,128
-Gang war on steroids.
-Chief doesn't like headlines.

55
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,597
If my ass is on the line,
I want my best man covering me.

56
00:04:58,198 --> 00:05:00,400
Appreciate the compliment...

57
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,770
...but won't Northwest get pissed
with me and Shane on their turf?

58
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:07,440
-The lead detective is Carlos Zamora.
-Never heard of him.

59
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,009
He's a comer, but he's raw.

60
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:12,412
Built his reputation working with
gangs. Knows them inside out.

61
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:15,248
-He know how we work?
-Let him do his thing...

62
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:18,485
...you do your thing. I don't care,
as long as it gets cracked.

63
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:24,925
Carlos, Vic Mackey. Shane Vendrell.

64
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:27,160
-Thanks for helping.
-What gang were they in?

65
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,864
-"Toros". Biggest and baddest here.
-Cameras catch this guy?

66
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:33,400
Just for show.
VCRs weren't hooked up.

67
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:39,973
-Who's the mom-to-be?
-Lucy. She was Train's girl.

68
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:44,578
-Train?
-Train Guttierez. He runs the "Toros".

69
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,248
Well, Train's gonna
wanna retaliate bigtime.

70
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:50,817
We find who he's targeting,
we find who did this.

71
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:53,954
I'll talk to Train, make sure
his guys don't do anything stupid.

72
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:56,489
What makes you think he'll listen?

73
00:05:57,224 --> 00:06:00,327
I used to be a "Toro" back in the day.

74
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:02,963
I've been able to keep
a pretty good lid on things.

75
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:07,901
Looks like the lid just got blown off.

76
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:19,646
The owner said there's
a high-school kid...

77
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:21,815
...who sweeps up at night.
Wasn't part of the body count.

78
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:25,151
-Kid call in sick?
-No. He should've been here.

79
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:28,722
Name is Jaime.

80
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:33,727
You seeing this?

81
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:37,130
-Goddamn Oprah Winfrey hour.
-Paging Dr. Phil.

82
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,699
No wonder Gilroy called us up.

83
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,635
A gang war's about to explode...

84
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:44,504
...and he's playing grief
counsellor to the soldiers.

85
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:46,840
You gotta let me handle this, Train,
me entiendes?

86
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,509
He's right. We'll handle it.

87
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:55,382
I'm working this case with Carlos.
Who would wanna start a war with you?

88
00:06:55,382 --> 00:06:59,853
-Things been peaceful.
-Until tonight. So who was it?

89
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:01,988
I told you, we've
been handling things.

90
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:03,023
Right.

91
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:08,962
-What's that bulge in your jacket?
-Yo, chill, dog.

92
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:12,265
Come on, man. What? What?

93
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:16,002
Concealed weapon.

94
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:20,540
-Suspicious white powder.
-Daily double.

95
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:25,278
So do I have to search all you guys,
or do I get some answers?

96
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:30,450
Is it the blacks, Chinese, "Los Mags"?
Who're we talking about?

97
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:37,590
The blacks. Wet Willie. He's been
making noise since he got paroled.

98
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:41,594
What do you know? A clue.

99
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:50,804
Hey!

100
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:55,141
Why are you shaking down these guys?
They trust me.

101
00:07:55,141 --> 00:08:00,080
-Yeah. I saw the circle jerk.
-You treat them like people, it works.

102
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,649
So does treating them
like the killing,...

103
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,417
...dealing, thieving
scumbags they are.

104
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:10,023
Mop-up boy went MIA tonight.
See if you can track him down.

105
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,728
-Where you going?
-Talk to Wet Willie.

106
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:17,530
I can do it. I know where
to find Wet Willie.

107
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,834
Hey, this might be your district,
but it's my world.

108
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,203
Different ZIP code, same pinheads.

109
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:28,375
Describe what you witnessed then.

110
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:33,012
Mackey put four bricks of cocaine into
evidence bags, two into weapons bags.

111
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,849
-Then he gave it to Shane, I think.
-You think?

112
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,551
You "think" is not "I'm sure."
I called IAD...

113
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:40,253
...because you said
you were sure.

114
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,422
-Okay.
-This is serious, Julien.

115
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:44,624
There's no point in doing
the right thing...

116
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:47,894
-...if your testimony is vague.
-I know.

117
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:51,831
Now, did Mackey give Shane the
cocaine then or did it happen later?

118
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:54,134
-No, it happened then.
-Then say that.

119
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:56,236
The statement you give to Frances...

120
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:59,572
...Mackey's lawyers will twist
it into anything but the truth.

121
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:02,409
-Do I have to say this in open court?
-Hopefully not.

122
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:05,278
It won't be good publicity
for Vic or the department.

123
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:08,915
If it goes the way I've planned,
they'll take a plea.

124
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:10,984
-They'll lose their jobs?
-Yeah.

125
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:13,153
Jail?

126
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:17,157
Julien.

127
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,861
Are you okay living with that?

128
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:26,332
What's fair for them out there
has to be fair for us in here.

129
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,981
"Facing Autism"? What's up with that?

130
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:44,884
That's Corrine's book.

131
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:51,224
A kid in Matthew's class
just got diagnosed.

132
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:56,029
Man, that's tough.
Family must be devastated?

133
00:09:56,596 --> 00:10:00,266
Yeah. I had this cousin
who was retarded.

134
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,438
Autism isn't the same thing
as being retarded.

135
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:09,075
What is it, like "Rain Man",
freaking out,...

136
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:11,911
...counting matchsticks
kind of thing?

137
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:17,650
No. It's not the same thing.

138
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:23,223
You don't care to educate yourself,
why don't you keep your mouth shut?

139
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,629
Describe what you saw at that point.

140
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:34,000
Detective Mackey placed four bricks
of cocaine into two evidence bags.

141
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,170
He then took two bricks
and placed it into a weapons bag...

142
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,639
...which he immediately handed
to Detective Vendrell.

143
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,377
-Hey. I thought you were off today.
-I am.

144
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:46,646
-What are you doing here?
-Taking care of business.

145
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,414
I'm glad I caught you.

146
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:52,051
I've been trying to figure out
how to handle this thing.

147
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:54,053
-And I had this idea...
-I don't wanna talk about it.

148
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:59,692
Julien, I'm your training officer.
You owe it to me to at least see if...

149
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:02,896
No offence, but I'm gonna go
my own way on this.

150
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:15,708
Okay, here's Wet Willie.

151
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:19,012
Take his buddy.
Keep him out of my way.

152
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,347
Go.

153
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:25,552
Wet Willie! Police! Stop!

154
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:28,922
-I said stop!
-I'll be with you in a minute.

155
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:30,890
Goddamn it! I said stop!

156
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:37,230
-You got the medicine?
-Right here.

157
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:44,771
Now, what do you want?

158
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:49,709
-What you sweating me for?
-I'm a cop. Slow down.

159
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,378
Slow down. Right here.
Hands behind your head.

160
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,681
-I didn't do nothing.
-Ever?

161
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:57,517
Or in the last 10 minutes,
Kunta Kinte?

162
00:11:57,517 --> 00:11:58,918
Suck my xxxx.

163
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:05,558
-What'd you say? Suck your what?
-Screw you.

164
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,794
So you've been
with your sick kid all night?

165
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:11,331
-He's been throwing up all over me.
-The mom can back you up?

166
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:15,034
My girlfriend, her sister,
her friend,...

167
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:17,637
...the nurse at the free clinic.
Man, why?

168
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,106
Never mind.

169
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:26,479
Suck your what? Suck your what?

170
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:28,781
-Hey. Shane!
-What's going on out there?

171
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:31,985
-Suck that, you piece of shit.
-Shane! Shane!

172
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:35,989
-What are you doing?
-Patty, call the police.

173
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:39,025
-Shane! Let's go!
-Call the police.

174
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,395
-What's going on out there?
-Get the licence plate!

175
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:47,900
-Are you out of your goddamn mind?
-No!

176
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,803
We're trying to prevent the war,
not start one, you stupid...

177
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:53,072
Goddamn.
The guy was a pain in the ass.

178
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:57,110
You're being a huge pain in the ass
lately. Should I take a piss on you?

179
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:02,348
-You're out of control.
-You want me out, say the word.

180
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:04,217
And don't think I won't!

181
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:07,954
You've gone over those things
10 times already.

182
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:12,925
He's a serial killer. Sally won't be
his last victim unless I catch him.

183
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:17,497
-You're obsessed.
-I'm dedicated. Hey, hey.

184
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:20,099
Come with me. You're too dedicated.

185
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:22,435
You need a gimme
to cleanse your palate.

186
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:30,209
-Low-priority files?
-Pick a card, any card.

187
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,478
What's the point of this?

188
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,848
We take half a day,
we make some citizen happy...

189
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:39,018
...and go back to your serial-killer
case on a winning streak.

190
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:41,621
-I don't have time for games.
-You're running in circles.

191
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:44,824
Now, I've got the cure.
So pick a card.

192
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,035
My mother's being
robbed by a psychic.

193
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:58,404
-A psychic?
-Her name's Frida.

194
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:02,141
She's bilked my mom and her
friends out of thousands of dollars.

195
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:07,113
What's the scam? Tainted-money con,
third-party ritual, elixir machine?

196
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:09,982
She claims to talk to my dead father.

197
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,453
My mom took out a second
mortgage on the house...

198
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:15,822
...to pay Frida for contacting
the spirit world.

199
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,725
But that's supposed
to be my house someday.

200
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:25,031
-Well, that is a problem.
-I know. What are you gonna do?

201
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:33,906
-Any luck with Wet Willie?
-He's not the guy.

202
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:38,377
We better find out who is before Train
makes a guess and starts shooting.

203
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:42,048
-Got a line on our missing mop-up boy.
-Yeah?

204
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:45,251
A gangbanger friend of his called
me and told me where he is.

205
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:49,222
-A banger just called you up?
-I told you, man, these guys trust me.

206
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:52,258
Jaime's bragging he saw the shooter
come out of the gun club.

207
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:56,696
-Great. Where do I find this Jaime?
-I got this one. Wanna back me up?

208
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:58,264
Just follow my taillights.

209
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:04,570
You sure you don't want one of these?
You look awfully tense.

210
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:07,473
I just testified before IAD.

211
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:10,710
I don't get why you'd complicate
your life by narking out another cop.

212
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:14,380
Because in my life,
I take personal responsibility.

213
00:15:14,814 --> 00:15:16,783
You might wanna try it sometime.

214
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:23,022
Ouch.

215
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:27,093
Skipping out on restaurant bills,
outstanding warrants.

216
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:30,163
-You don't even have a job.
-I make money here and there.

217
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:32,665
I'm a cop. I know what
"here and there" means.

218
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:35,802
If this is what you're like,
I can't be around you.

219
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:39,071
I really think you could use a beer.

220
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:42,408
When this housesitting gig ends,
you won't have a place to live.

221
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,010
Whatever will I do?

222
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:47,046
I'm serious.
Do you even have a plan?

223
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:52,885
When was the last time
you even applied for a job?

224
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:57,356
What's your plan? To keep pretending
you're something you're not?

225
00:15:57,356 --> 00:16:00,393
-It's not that easy.
-I'll try if you'll try.

226
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:09,902
-Jaime?
-Nah, Jaime left.

227
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:14,140
Try again, smart-ass.
Finish your drinks somewhere else.

228
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:20,847
Jaime, we hear you saw
the gun-club shooter tonight.

229
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,049
What colours was he wearing?

230
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:27,854
Stop posing for a picture
and start yapping.

231
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:32,625
-You saw the shooter, right?
-Maybe.

232
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:36,929
-What gang was the shooter in?
-You know who the shooter runs with?

233
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,764
No.

234
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:43,269
You're not blind,
and you only seem half stupid...

235
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:46,606
...so I bet you got a good guess
who this guy's affiliated with.

236
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:47,974
Tell us.

237
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,744
-You guys ain't listening.
-What gang was the shooter in?

238
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:53,512
The white people's gang.

239
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:57,850
Our shooter is white?

240
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,852
-Early to mid-30s.
-Gringo with a grudge.

241
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:03,422
-There goes our gang-war theory.
-More headlines the chief won't like.

242
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:05,224
The Latino community is on edge.

243
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:07,894
Raoul Jiminez is on his way
to hear our progress.

244
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:11,097
Jiminez? He run out of janitor
strikes to organize?

245
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:14,433
What pisses you off more?
That he fights the establishment...

246
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:16,002
...or that he usually wins?

247
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,338
Thanks for the new partner,
by the way.

248
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:23,509
-It's a hate crime.
-We don't know what it is yet.

249
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:28,247
A white man kills eight Latinos, and
you don't know if it's a hate crime?

250
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:32,952
My people are scared.
What are the police doing?

251
00:17:32,952 --> 00:17:37,523
-We got a drawing of the shooter.
-Even the artist won't vouch for that.

252
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:39,992
Our witness didn't see much
past the white skin.

253
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:42,929
Release it to the press. Maybe
someone will recognize him.

254
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:45,631
It's so vague, every
Anglo on the street...

255
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:47,566
...is gonna look like a suspect.

256
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:52,171
-Now you know how we feel every day.
-Please. Save it for the microphones.

257
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:54,974
I think it's important the public
knows who the enemy is.

258
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:56,742
It's a waste of time, Ben.

259
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,413
Release the sketch.

260
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:11,457
Since when do we kowtow
to the "Mexico First" crowd?

261
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:14,460
If we don't include him,
he'll make our lives hell.

262
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,262
Let him try.

263
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:19,398
Have you driven around the city
lately? He's the majority now.

264
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:22,335
-We're still wearing the badges.
-Yeah, for the time being.

265
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:26,105
How is screwing up an investigation
gonna keep Jiminez off our backs?

266
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,007
I'm counting on you
not to screw it up.

267
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:32,244
Bring in this killer and we keep
our badges another day.

268
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:35,815
-Hey, no one's taking mine away.
-We're dinosaurs, Vic.

269
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:38,250
And make no mistake,
the meteor's coming.

270
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:46,059
Your son says you're being
swindled by this psychic.

271
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:48,361
Frida's not a psychic,
she's a medium.

272
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:51,598
She predicted Gene would
go to the police, didn't she?

273
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:57,136
Yes. She said Gene was waiting for
me to die so he could get my money.

274
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:01,174
You do know these so-called
psychics are all frauds, right?

275
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:05,578
Well, most of them are, but not Frida.
She brings me messages from Frank.

276
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:10,083
-Frank?
-He was my husband. Cancer got him.

277
00:19:10,517 --> 00:19:14,320
How do you think Frank would feel
if you lost the house you lived in...

278
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,723
...to keep paying this medium?

279
00:19:16,723 --> 00:19:19,325
I'd pay anything to talk to Frank.

280
00:19:21,895 --> 00:19:24,931
-Detective Mackey? I'm with...
-IAD. Yeah, I remember.

281
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:29,602
An investigation has been initiated
into your actions on April 2nd.

282
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:33,540
Look over these charges and decide
if you'd like a formal interview.

283
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:38,311
Vic. We got five people shot dead
in a family grocer's, all Latinos.

284
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:42,482
-This one's in your district.
-I'll have to get back to you.

285
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:51,958
Here they come. Secure the front.
Don't let anybody else in, okay?

286
00:19:54,894 --> 00:19:57,830
-Officer.
-Detectives.

287
00:19:58,431 --> 00:20:00,867
-What happened?
-Guy came in blasting.

288
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:03,570
Killed everybody in here
except the owner in back.

289
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,004
He heard the shots,
came out with...

290
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:07,173
...a baseball bat and
ran the shooter off.

291
00:20:07,173 --> 00:20:12,812
-Where's the owner now?
-He's pretty upset. This was his son.

292
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:21,054
-My boy.
-You were back here?

293
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:23,823
-Yes.
-And you grabbed the baseball bat?

294
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:27,493
That baseball bat over there?

295
00:20:28,995 --> 00:20:31,497
Now the shooter, he was white?

296
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:35,802
What happened after
you chased him out?

297
00:20:35,802 --> 00:20:40,239
-He got away.
-On foot? He didn't get into a car?

298
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:43,076
-No.
-Well, which way did he run?

299
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,211
I don't remember.

300
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:47,914
There's blood on this bat.
Did you hit him with it?

301
00:20:48,548 --> 00:20:51,784
I guess. I don't remember.

302
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:57,423
Our bad guy may have ran away,
but this being L.A...

303
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,058
...I'm guessing he drove here.

304
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:03,663
Check the plates on these cars. Match
them up and see what stands out.

305
00:21:03,663 --> 00:21:05,198
You want me doing grunt work?

306
00:21:05,698 --> 00:21:08,701
Yeah. Because, A, it's important...

307
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:11,771
...and B, I don't really feel like
hearing you talk this morning.

308
00:21:14,307 --> 00:21:17,010
I got a 10-square-block
perimeter being roped off.

309
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:19,479
If he's on foot and bleeding,
we'll get him.

310
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:23,016
Gee, I wonder what
took them so long.

311
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,284
Can I help you?

312
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:28,755
We're investigating complaints
about your business practices.

313
00:21:28,755 --> 00:21:31,824
I offer a money-back guarantee
to those who are unhappy.

314
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:33,593
Very few people request it.

315
00:21:33,593 --> 00:21:35,995
Six hundred dollars for a candle?

316
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:38,898
Looks like the kind I get
at the 99-cent store.

317
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:40,933
The candle itself is ordinary.

318
00:21:40,933 --> 00:21:43,803
It's the blessing ceremony
that makes them so valuable.

319
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:47,040
Blessing ceremony.
What does that entail?

320
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,375
Taking the price tag off,
sticking it on a shelf?

321
00:21:50,376 --> 00:21:53,046
We'd like you to come with us,
answer a few questions.

322
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:02,355
You yearn for a young woman
who doesn't yearn after you.

323
00:22:04,357 --> 00:22:07,293
What? You see I'm not wearing a ring,
you figure a guy who shops at the...

324
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:12,065
...99-cent store is single and has the
hots for some woman out of his league.

325
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,968
Is now when I fork over a week's
salary for a candle, or...?

326
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:21,207
She's someone that you work with
or work close by.

327
00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:24,911
Come on, let's go.

328
00:22:25,945 --> 00:22:28,281
You're wasting your time
with her, you know.

329
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:32,952
Frances will ask about
the night you stole the truck.

330
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:35,822
And this'll clean the slate
on all my charges, right?

331
00:22:35,822 --> 00:22:38,758
Right. So long as you tell the truth.

332
00:22:38,758 --> 00:22:42,095
-So how do you want me to do it?
-Do what?

333
00:22:42,095 --> 00:22:45,465
Tell my story. I mean, you're paying,
so you get to pick.

334
00:22:45,465 --> 00:22:49,969
I can be all sweet
and innocenty, like:

335
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:53,239
I don't know what possessed
me to steal the truck that night...

336
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:58,611
...but when I found those bags of
cocaine inside, I got so scared.

337
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:03,816
Or I can be all biker-chick,
master-thief girl.

338
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:08,054
Like: I ripped the Navigator,
was on my way to get it chopped...

339
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:10,256
...and I stumble across
these two keys of blow.

340
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:15,061
-How about sincere and honest?
-Not my best one.

341
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:18,931
-Don't get too cute with her.
-But I am cute.

342
00:23:21,634 --> 00:23:24,437
-Are you involved with anyone?
-Excuse me?

343
00:23:24,437 --> 00:23:27,640
Well, my most recent lover
just died of a drug overdose...

344
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:33,513
...thanks to high-octane stolen coke,
so I find myself sexually available.

345
00:23:35,715 --> 00:23:42,221
If by involved you mean married with
a baby girl, then the answer is yes.

346
00:23:42,221 --> 00:23:48,161
Damn. Think of the things I could get
away with if I was banging a captain.

347
00:23:49,629 --> 00:23:52,031
Stay out of trouble so I don't
have to see you again.

348
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:56,202
-But you wanna see me again.
-No, I don't.

349
00:23:58,805 --> 00:24:03,276
If I was 18 and single,
maybe it'd be a different story.

350
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:07,947
I would've chewed you up
and spit you out when you were 18.

351
00:24:08,748 --> 00:24:10,316
I wouldn't be so sure.

352
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,656
The other shop owners
tell the same story.

353
00:24:16,656 --> 00:24:18,958
They heard gunshots,
but didn't see anything.

354
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:22,695
Nobody looked out and saw
which way this guy went running?

355
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:25,865
-That's what they say.
-That doesn't pass the smell test.

356
00:24:25,865 --> 00:24:26,966
Vic!

357
00:24:33,372 --> 00:24:35,808
This is the only car whose owner
is unaccounted for.

358
00:24:37,176 --> 00:24:38,411
Check it out.

359
00:24:42,048 --> 00:24:44,917
-Spare ammo.
-Who's the car registered to?

360
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:49,922
-A George Michael Klassen.
-Nice to meet you, you sick prick.

361
00:25:10,576 --> 00:25:11,944
All clear.

362
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:19,051
Goddamn it.

363
00:25:21,254 --> 00:25:23,789
As I was going through the truck,
I found...

364
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:27,293
...some guns and two bags of cocaine.

365
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:32,164
Okay, let's go back
to stealing the vehicle.

366
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:36,702
<i>You saw Detective Vendrell
</i>park the truck, get out...

367
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:39,138
<i>-...and go inside the building.
</i>-Yes, ma'am.

368
00:25:39,138 --> 00:25:42,008
And no one went in or out of the truck
between the time...

369
00:25:42,008 --> 00:25:44,543
...he left it and the
time you stole it.

370
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:45,912
No, ma'am.

371
00:25:46,979 --> 00:25:50,917
It's always sad when the people
that you expect to enforce the law...

372
00:25:50,917 --> 00:25:52,385
...break it themselves.

373
00:25:53,819 --> 00:25:58,224
Canvass the place. Find out
if anybody saw a car pulling out.

374
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:02,128
We found two bodies inside.
They're George's in-laws.

375
00:26:02,128 --> 00:26:03,296
My God.

376
00:26:03,296 --> 00:26:05,598
But his wife and son,
they're not here.

377
00:26:05,598 --> 00:26:08,668
We're afraid George might have
taken them with him.

378
00:26:08,668 --> 00:26:11,037
Any idea where your brother
might have gone?

379
00:26:11,037 --> 00:26:12,305
No.

380
00:26:12,305 --> 00:26:14,840
Any place he might feel
comfortable hiding?

381
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,343
-No.
-This is important.

382
00:26:17,343 --> 00:26:19,946
We have to find him before
he does any harm to them.

383
00:26:19,946 --> 00:26:23,115
Well, I can't imagine George
would ever hurt Myra or Brady.

384
00:26:23,115 --> 00:26:26,185
Can you imagine him killing
15 people in cold blood?

385
00:26:26,786 --> 00:26:29,855
Well, that's different.

386
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:34,026
I mean, you have to understand.

387
00:26:34,026 --> 00:26:38,464
This used to be a nice place to live.
Clean, safe.

388
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:42,034
George just got fed up being
surrounded by all the spics.

389
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:44,837
Can you blame him?

390
00:26:48,908 --> 00:26:51,344
Klassen's picture's plastered
all over the news.

391
00:26:51,344 --> 00:26:54,414
He can't step outside without
somebody spotting him.

392
00:26:54,414 --> 00:26:56,483
That doesn't help us save
his wife and boy.

393
00:26:56,483 --> 00:26:59,619
I'm more concerned about what
you're doing to stop the next attack.

394
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:02,455
Everything we can.
We know who he is. We got his car.

395
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:06,125
We got units on his family and
friends. We got every base covered.

396
00:27:06,626 --> 00:27:09,929
Waiting around for him to make
his next move isn't gonna cut it.

397
00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:11,331
Where you going?

398
00:27:11,331 --> 00:27:14,634
Hey, as long as he's
got it all covered,...

399
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:16,936
...I'm gonna go check on something.

400
00:27:34,988 --> 00:27:36,789
Getting a nice tan?

401
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:38,758
About all I'm good for, I guess.

402
00:27:39,826 --> 00:27:42,262
-You find any blood out here?
-Nope.

403
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:47,634
So there was blood on the bat
and nowhere else?

404
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:51,504
There's some blood in the store
unconnected to any of the victims.

405
00:27:51,504 --> 00:27:52,605
Show me.

406
00:27:55,108 --> 00:27:58,611
Shooter loses this much blood and
doesn't drip any on the pavement?

407
00:27:58,611 --> 00:28:00,213
Maybe he went out the back.

408
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:03,716
-SID check it?
-Beats me.

409
00:28:12,292 --> 00:28:14,727
Looks like somebody did
a nice little sweep job.

410
00:28:15,295 --> 00:28:18,932
Yes, it does. Makes you wonder why.

411
00:28:19,465 --> 00:28:23,636
You know, Houdini wanted desperately
to believe in the paranormal.

412
00:28:23,636 --> 00:28:26,873
Couldn't abide the fakes and frauds.
Spent his life trying to debunk them.

413
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,309
Still held out hope, though.

414
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:35,448
Before he died, he gave his wife
Beatrice a secret password...

415
00:28:35,448 --> 00:28:38,451
...that he promised her he'd try
to send her from the afterworld...

416
00:28:38,451 --> 00:28:41,187
...so she could tell the difference
between phoneys and the real McCoys.

417
00:28:41,721 --> 00:28:45,425
When he passed away,
Beatrice travelled the globe...

418
00:28:45,425 --> 00:28:50,930
...met with every gypsy, psychic,
tarot-card reader she could find.

419
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:53,533
Not one of them
ever got the password right.

420
00:28:53,533 --> 00:28:56,169
Houdini should have
had a little more faith.

421
00:28:56,169 --> 00:28:59,939
-Faith?
-On Sundays they call it Christianity.

422
00:29:00,907 --> 00:29:02,575
The afterlife's no different.

423
00:29:02,575 --> 00:29:08,348
Church only takes you for 10 percent.
You've been wringing these ladies dry.

424
00:29:08,348 --> 00:29:12,385
If they refuse to press charges,
you can't touch me.

425
00:29:12,385 --> 00:29:15,588
If I find out you still have
your hooks in these women...

426
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:18,391
...I'll find other charges to press.

427
00:29:18,391 --> 00:29:21,194
-Fire code violations.
-Parking tickets.

428
00:29:21,194 --> 00:29:24,998
Zoning laws.
You name it, I'll find it.

429
00:29:24,998 --> 00:29:27,166
How's your future looking now?

430
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,402
What do you want from me?

431
00:29:29,402 --> 00:29:31,504
It's time to get some
new marks, honey.

432
00:29:41,881 --> 00:29:43,683
What the hell is he doing?

433
00:29:45,785 --> 00:29:49,422
-You arrested the shop owners?
-Brought them in for questioning.

434
00:29:49,422 --> 00:29:52,425
-Why?
-Their stories didn't make sense.

435
00:29:52,425 --> 00:29:56,529
Leon's son died four hours ago. How
much sense is he supposed to make?

436
00:29:56,529 --> 00:29:58,364
If he knows something, we need it.

437
00:29:58,364 --> 00:30:01,634
You don't interrogate
a grieving father!

438
00:30:01,634 --> 00:30:05,004
And you don't get answers from
people by passing around hugs.

439
00:30:05,004 --> 00:30:07,874
You don't get them
by pissing on people either.

440
00:30:07,874 --> 00:30:10,677
We've got a racist madman
targeting Latinos...

441
00:30:10,677 --> 00:30:13,479
...and you want to interrogate
the victim's family?

442
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:15,748
When you trade your
megaphone for a badge,...

443
00:30:15,748 --> 00:30:17,583
...that's when I'll seek your input.

444
00:30:19,152 --> 00:30:21,487
I insist on witnessing
the interviews...

445
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:23,990
...to ensure these men and women
aren't mistreated.

446
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,793
-No.
-Excuse me?

447
00:30:26,793 --> 00:30:28,594
I've included you as a courtesy.

448
00:30:28,594 --> 00:30:31,330
It's time to give my men
the space to do their jobs.

449
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:34,434
His wife and 10-year-old son
are missing.

450
00:30:34,434 --> 00:30:35,668
My son's dead.

451
00:30:35,668 --> 00:30:37,804
You're not telling me the truth, Leon.

452
00:30:37,804 --> 00:30:39,505
-Yes, I am.
-You know something.

453
00:30:39,505 --> 00:30:40,807
No.

454
00:30:40,807 --> 00:30:43,042
If you're lying so
you can get to your...

455
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:45,545
...son's killer before
us to get revenge...

456
00:30:45,545 --> 00:30:49,282
-...I can't let that happen.
-I don't know anything.

457
00:30:50,783 --> 00:30:54,487
Then why are you and the other shop
owners all telling the same lie?

458
00:30:56,155 --> 00:31:00,893
And why did someone sweep the path
in the back alley after the shootings?

459
00:31:03,196 --> 00:31:04,764
Leon?

460
00:31:05,798 --> 00:31:08,701
You can tell me.
What did you really see?

461
00:31:08,701 --> 00:31:11,871
"Nada". I didn't see nothing.

462
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:22,448
I just talked with Frances.

463
00:31:23,082 --> 00:31:25,585
You've got her looking into
the Strike Team again?

464
00:31:25,585 --> 00:31:26,786
Yes.

465
00:31:27,854 --> 00:31:30,223
You ever plan on telling me about it?

466
00:31:30,223 --> 00:31:33,459
I didn't wanna bother you with it
until things were more definitive.

467
00:31:33,459 --> 00:31:35,561
I got a problem in this squad, David.

468
00:31:35,561 --> 00:31:38,197
My captain and my best cop
aren't getting along.

469
00:31:38,197 --> 00:31:40,133
We stand for different things.

470
00:31:42,602 --> 00:31:47,006
Well, you better make friends,
or I'm gonna have to make a choice.

471
00:31:47,673 --> 00:31:49,942
And I don't think
you're gonna like that choice.

472
00:31:57,150 --> 00:32:00,086
Maybe you should read this
before you make any choices.

473
00:32:02,822 --> 00:32:05,558
You're gonna need a signature
on this here...

474
00:32:05,558 --> 00:32:09,395
I've been getting some very strong
signals at this desk.

475
00:32:09,962 --> 00:32:13,733
Gee, the desk that I work at? Spooky.

476
00:32:14,634 --> 00:32:18,871
I'm getting an S name.
Is there a Sarah?

477
00:32:18,871 --> 00:32:21,908
Sorry, no Sarahs.

478
00:32:21,908 --> 00:32:23,810
Or a Sally.

479
00:32:27,246 --> 00:32:29,148
I think there's a Sally.

480
00:32:31,818 --> 00:32:33,753
Do you know who I'm talking about?

481
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:42,128
You going through my desk?
Reading my file on Sally?

482
00:32:42,128 --> 00:32:43,396
No, I didn't.

483
00:32:43,963 --> 00:32:46,599
Frida! There you are!

484
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:49,836
-Are you all right?
-Fine.

485
00:32:53,606 --> 00:32:56,542
Yeah. Let's all talk in another room.

486
00:32:59,579 --> 00:33:00,780
Follow me.

487
00:33:04,083 --> 00:33:05,852
She has a message for you.

488
00:33:10,356 --> 00:33:13,860
There's an innocent woman and
an innocent kid in danger out there...

489
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,962
...and you're not
telling me the truth!

490
00:33:15,962 --> 00:33:17,997
Yes, I am!

491
00:33:23,703 --> 00:33:26,505
Someone's holding a gun
to their heads right now...

492
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:28,641
...and you're stopping me
from finding them.

493
00:33:28,641 --> 00:33:29,709
I'm not.

494
00:33:29,709 --> 00:33:33,446
You might as well be pulling
the trigger. Tell me the truth!

495
00:33:33,446 --> 00:33:36,415
-I am!
-He doesn't know anything.

496
00:33:36,415 --> 00:33:37,783
Yes, he does.

497
00:33:39,385 --> 00:33:40,853
You gonna pull the
trigger on that kid?

498
00:33:40,853 --> 00:33:41,888
Vic!

499
00:33:44,957 --> 00:33:47,426
What does that make you?

500
00:33:48,461 --> 00:33:51,430
-What if it was your boy?
-My boy's dead.

501
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:55,268
That's because I couldn't stop the
racist pig from pulling that trigger.

502
00:33:55,268 --> 00:33:57,670
Don't be like the man
who killed your son.

503
00:33:57,670 --> 00:34:02,508
-I'm nothing like him.
-Then show me. Show me.

504
00:34:08,848 --> 00:34:10,149
I heard the shots...

505
00:34:11,684 --> 00:34:14,153
...the shots that killed Favian.

506
00:34:14,153 --> 00:34:17,723
When I came outside, the man
was standing there with his...

507
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:21,193
With his back to me.
I hit him with a baseball bat.

508
00:34:22,528 --> 00:34:23,896
Knocked him out.

509
00:34:24,764 --> 00:34:26,299
What did you do with him?

510
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,502
My friends heard the noise.
They came over.

511
00:34:29,902 --> 00:34:34,206
They dragged him out the back.
That's why we swept up afterwards.

512
00:34:35,808 --> 00:34:38,844
-What did you do with him?
-He killed my boy.

513
00:34:38,844 --> 00:34:42,915
-I know.
-So I wanted to kill him back.

514
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:44,283
I know.

515
00:34:44,283 --> 00:34:48,454
I couldn't do it, though.
I didn't have the courage.

516
00:34:48,955 --> 00:34:50,823
So, what did you do with him?

517
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:56,395
We gave him to the "Toros".
I couldn't kill him...

518
00:34:58,431 --> 00:35:00,166
...but I knew they would.

519
00:35:01,867 --> 00:35:06,105
Shit. The in-laws were killed
after the grocery shootings.

520
00:35:06,105 --> 00:35:09,875
-So Train or his guys killed them.
-They got the wife and kid.

521
00:35:11,143 --> 00:35:12,611
God help you.

522
00:35:16,549 --> 00:35:19,051
Look out! Heads up!

523
00:35:24,457 --> 00:35:26,826
-Where's Train?
-Get him off me!

524
00:35:26,826 --> 00:35:29,629
I can't do that, Lucas.
You went too far. What did you do?

525
00:35:29,629 --> 00:35:32,499
-He had it coming.
-Did the wife and kid have it coming?

526
00:35:32,499 --> 00:35:35,668
-We were making things better.
-We didn't start the killing.

527
00:35:36,102 --> 00:35:38,304
Where's Train keeping his family?

528
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:41,207
You wanna tell me
with your teeth or without?

529
00:35:41,207 --> 00:35:44,077
He's not gonna let you
beat me down. He's one of us.

530
00:35:46,613 --> 00:35:50,016
Not after what you did. Now, where
do we find this guy's wife and kid?

531
00:35:53,386 --> 00:35:57,390
You didn't see this coming.
You didn't see this.

532
00:35:57,390 --> 00:36:00,126
-Please don't hurt him.
-What? What? You wanna kiss me?

533
00:36:00,126 --> 00:36:03,429
Please, don't. We'll do
anything you want. Just... No.

534
00:36:03,429 --> 00:36:07,166
-Let go. Please. George!
-Don't touch my mom!

535
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:08,535
Brady! No!

536
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:18,144
-Train! Don't do this, Train!
-Put it down!

537
00:36:20,113 --> 00:36:22,749
-For Lucy.
-No!

538
00:36:32,525 --> 00:36:33,927
He had to pay.

539
00:36:35,061 --> 00:36:38,498
And who's gonna pay now?
Who's gonna pay?

540
00:36:39,332 --> 00:36:40,900
We all pay, man.

541
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:47,807
He's gonna pay for the rest of his
life. You don't want to. Trust me.

542
00:37:04,958 --> 00:37:07,427
It's okay. You're all right.

543
00:37:07,427 --> 00:37:09,796
We've gotta get Vic Mackey
off the streets.

544
00:37:09,796 --> 00:37:11,864
-Have you taken his statement yet?
-No.

545
00:37:11,864 --> 00:37:15,168
-But you have to admit, it looks bad.
-Very bad.

546
00:37:15,735 --> 00:37:18,037
We need to keep this thing
under control.

547
00:37:18,771 --> 00:37:19,973
How can we?

548
00:37:22,809 --> 00:37:25,612
The chief is gonna have a heart attack
when he hears about this.

549
00:37:27,013 --> 00:37:28,748
If the press gets ahold of it...

550
00:37:29,682 --> 00:37:32,485
Goddamn it.
This is the last thing I needed.

551
00:37:32,485 --> 00:37:36,089
I'll talk to my people, make sure
there are no leaks on this end.

552
00:37:36,089 --> 00:37:37,457
Yeah, me too.

553
00:37:38,858 --> 00:37:41,561
Okay. Good.

554
00:37:41,561 --> 00:37:44,130
I just need a few days to figure out
how to handle this.

555
00:37:54,974 --> 00:37:58,978
-What's going to happen to them?
-What do you think?

556
00:37:58,978 --> 00:38:01,614
They handed a man over
to gangbangers to be killed.

557
00:38:01,614 --> 00:38:03,182
They handed over a hatemonger.

558
00:38:03,683 --> 00:38:06,619
Their actions led to three people
being killed.

559
00:38:06,619 --> 00:38:10,223
And a woman being sexually assaulted
in front of her 10-year-old son.

560
00:38:10,223 --> 00:38:13,459
-They couldn't have foreseen that.
-They conspired to kill a man...

561
00:38:13,459 --> 00:38:15,495
...and then tried to cover it up.

562
00:38:15,495 --> 00:38:18,097
They're victims.
My group won't let...

563
00:38:18,097 --> 00:38:20,867
...this department turn
them into martyrs.

564
00:38:20,867 --> 00:38:23,302
I thought martyrs
are what brought in the donations...

565
00:38:23,302 --> 00:38:25,338
...and got your name in the papers.

566
00:38:25,338 --> 00:38:28,274
I'll see they don't spend
one day in jail.

567
00:38:32,011 --> 00:38:33,446
They probably won't.

568
00:38:34,714 --> 00:38:35,982
I should get going.

569
00:38:36,716 --> 00:38:38,117
Can I give you a lift?

570
00:38:39,152 --> 00:38:42,288
No, I got one.
Thanks for the offer, though.

571
00:38:42,722 --> 00:38:44,190
Offer's always good.

572
00:39:02,508 --> 00:39:04,911
Sir, do you have a minute?

573
00:39:08,214 --> 00:39:11,684
Sorry. I missed dinner.
What can I do for you?

574
00:39:13,252 --> 00:39:16,589
I don't think that Julien and I are
turning out to be a good match.

575
00:39:16,589 --> 00:39:17,390
Really?

576
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:18,991
I just think he might
be better off...

577
00:39:18,991 --> 00:39:22,361
...with a different training officer.
Finnegan's not riding with anyone.

578
00:39:22,361 --> 00:39:25,565
-I could take the next candidate.
-Julien's going through a tough time.

579
00:39:25,565 --> 00:39:27,200
He needs you now more than ever.

580
00:39:28,101 --> 00:39:29,635
You're as good as we have.

581
00:39:32,138 --> 00:39:33,439
You'll work things out.

582
00:39:36,876 --> 00:39:38,978
-How could you do this?
-It was a mistake.

583
00:39:38,978 --> 00:39:41,681
We were gonna use the coke
for an undercover bust.

584
00:39:41,681 --> 00:39:44,450
I didn't do the paperwork.
When it got stolen with the truck...

585
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:47,720
-Is that what you plan on telling IAD?
-Come on, what do they have?

586
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:51,357
-A car thief as a witness? Please.
-She's convincing.

587
00:39:51,924 --> 00:39:54,994
Plus, there's the officer who saw you
take the stuff in the first place.

588
00:39:55,394 --> 00:39:57,296
They've established
chain of custody.

589
00:39:57,296 --> 00:39:59,932
From you to the truck
to the OD victim.

590
00:40:02,335 --> 00:40:04,837
Shane was the one in possession
of the drugs.

591
00:40:04,837 --> 00:40:06,639
He's the one that got
the truck stolen.

592
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:07,807
Ben, no!

593
00:40:07,807 --> 00:40:10,343
I don't have the juice anymore
to protect all of you.

594
00:40:11,344 --> 00:40:15,214
Shane had the drugs.
We lay it all on his doorstep.

595
00:40:19,252 --> 00:40:22,155
It's either that or you two
can share a cell.

596
00:40:26,592 --> 00:40:29,095
You don't have to like it,
but it's time to serve him up.

597
00:40:39,272 --> 00:40:43,042
-I was just about to close.
-What was Sally's message?

598
00:40:46,012 --> 00:40:48,848
-She says not to give up.
-I haven't.

599
00:40:49,415 --> 00:40:53,486
She says you're the only one
still fighting for her.

600
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,122
What else did she say?

601
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:26,219
You have something for me?

602
00:41:27,653 --> 00:41:31,791
An IAD file of a current investigation
my people are trying to cover up.

603
00:41:32,391 --> 00:41:35,094
Dirty cops? Why give it to me?

604
00:41:35,828 --> 00:41:38,331
You'll see it gets the publicity
it deserves.

605
00:41:42,768 --> 00:41:46,005
And if you leak it to the press,
it'd look self-serving.

606
00:41:47,106 --> 00:41:48,641
You want it or not?

607
00:41:49,342 --> 00:41:50,509
Of course.

608
00:41:51,377 --> 00:41:55,948
Don't worry, David. I'll make sure
they spell your name right.

609
00:42:02,154 --> 00:42:03,422
That's my book.

610
00:42:06,826 --> 00:42:11,831
The reason I have it is because
Matthew has autism.

611
00:42:11,831 --> 00:42:15,134
-We found out a few weeks ago.
-Jesus.

612
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:22,441
-Vic. Vic, I'm sorry.
-It's been tough. Lot of work.

613
00:42:23,943 --> 00:42:27,713
You know, the one thing
I've learned is...

614
00:42:29,348 --> 00:42:32,018
...I goddamn love that kid
more now than ever.

615
00:42:33,953 --> 00:42:36,222
Hey, he's got problems, you know...

616
00:42:39,558 --> 00:42:41,394
...but I'm never giving up on him.

617
00:42:57,109 --> 00:42:59,245
I'm not giving up on
you either, Shane.

618
00:43:02,448 --> 00:43:04,283
I'm gonna have to get
a little creative...

619
00:43:04,283 --> 00:43:06,452
...on this "past job
experience" section.

620
00:43:06,452 --> 00:43:08,821
Creative's cool. Just don't lie.

621
00:43:08,821 --> 00:43:12,158
Though I might need a few glasses
of wine to get that creative.

622
00:43:12,158 --> 00:43:14,860
Let me just skip on
down here to the...

623
00:43:15,628 --> 00:43:17,663
What's this? References. References.

624
00:43:19,665 --> 00:43:24,804
It wouldn't hurt to have a glowing one
from a respected city police officer.

625
00:43:27,206 --> 00:43:30,109
-What, you're not gonna help me out?
-I can't.

626
00:43:32,011 --> 00:43:33,679
Unbelievable.

627
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:37,249
Good enough to suck,
but not good enough to vouch for.

628
00:43:37,249 --> 00:43:38,651
That's not it.

629
00:43:38,651 --> 00:43:41,320
I know. You won't even come out
to my perspective employer.

630
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,589
-What kind of lie is that?
-I can't.

631
00:43:44,824 --> 00:43:50,062
I'm just not ready to tell anyone.
The people in my life... I can't.

632
00:43:50,062 --> 00:43:51,697
-You said you were trying.
-I am.

633
00:43:51,697 --> 00:43:53,699
-No, you're not.
-I am.

634
00:43:53,699 --> 00:43:56,035
Do you know what it takes for me
to keep coming back here?

635
00:43:57,036 --> 00:44:01,607
I mean, I was taught...
I was told to believe things.

636
00:44:02,842 --> 00:44:06,679
In spite of those beliefs, I keep
coming back here night after night...

637
00:44:07,413 --> 00:44:09,181
...because I care about you.

638
00:44:12,451 --> 00:44:13,686
See?

639
00:44:15,021 --> 00:44:16,522
I'm trying.

640
00:44:17,556 --> 00:44:21,227
Just being here is trying.

641
00:44:58,211 --> 00:44:59,479
Police.

642
00:45:05,652 --> 00:45:07,354
Tomas Motyashik?

643
00:45:11,058 --> 00:45:13,460
You have an open warrant
for your arrest.

644
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:16,663
Let's go.

645
00:45:25,906 --> 00:45:27,140
Don't worry.

646
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:30,143
Your boyfriend'll lock up.

647
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:33,113
Won't you, officer?
