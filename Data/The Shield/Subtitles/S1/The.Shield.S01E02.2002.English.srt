1
00:00:01,067 --> 00:00:02,568
<i>Previously on The Shield:</i>

2
00:00:02,568 --> 00:00:06,372
<i>Mr. Esteana claims you used
</i>excessive force during his arrest.

3
00:00:06,372 --> 00:00:07,940
Fourth complaint since I came here.

4
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:10,143
You don't like the timetable,
you take it up with Gilroy.

5
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:12,478
In this building, I'm in charge.

6
00:00:12,478 --> 00:00:14,647
Maybe in your own mind, amigo.

7
00:00:14,647 --> 00:00:16,449
But in the real world,
I don't answer to you.

8
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:18,584
Not even on Cinco de Mayo.

9
00:00:18,584 --> 00:00:20,887
-What's your take on Vic Mackey?
-I don't judge other cops.

10
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:23,956
Mackey's not a cop.
He's Al Capone with a badge.

11
00:00:23,956 --> 00:00:25,725
The guy I saw Mackey talking to
is a drug dealer named...

12
00:00:25,725 --> 00:00:27,527
Named Rondell Robinson.

13
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,529
You suggesting
Mackey's working for a dealer?

14
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,698
I'm suggesting
he's working for Mackey.

15
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:35,368
-Who's he?
-Moses Hernandez. He's in Justice.

16
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:39,272
We're talking about a case that puts
Mac behind bars for a along time.

17
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:41,374
What are you getting out of this?

18
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:42,909
I just want a dirty
cop off the streets.

19
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:45,078
It's all about trust,
then why did he end up dead?

20
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:46,345
Yeah.

21
00:00:46,345 --> 00:00:49,315
Knock knock who's there?
Strike Team, Mr. Drug Dealer.

22
00:00:49,982 --> 00:00:52,218
And on top of that, Terry here
is losing his cherry tonight.

23
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,486
He's coming with us.

24
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:18,344
-911. What's your emergency?
<i>-I've got an officer down!</i>

25
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:21,647
-Could you repeat that?
<i>-This is Detective Vic Mackey!</i>

26
00:01:21,647 --> 00:01:24,550
<i>-An officer's down!
</i>-You have an officer down.

27
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:27,186
<i>The goddamn police radio
</i>in the van isn't working.

28
00:01:27,186 --> 00:01:31,124
-What's the officer's condition?
<i>-Condition? He's dying!</i>

29
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:33,326
<i>-We're in a...
</i>-I have the address.

30
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:36,496
<i>-Where are we?
</i>-An ambulance is en route.

31
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:38,131
<i>I'm coming!</i>

32
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:39,232
Detective?

33
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:40,900
<i>Detective?</i>

34
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:44,137
He was about 10, 15 feet
in front of me and Shane...

35
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:47,006
...when I hear this gunshot,
and I see Terry go down.

36
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:48,141
Jesus.

37
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:51,978
Shane and I turn the corner, and we
see the guy in this back bathroom.

38
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:54,413
He gets off a few rounds.
We hit back.

39
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:56,716
At least you killed the prick.

40
00:01:58,618 --> 00:01:59,886
Hey.

41
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:02,655
Terry's a tough son of a bitch.
He's gonna be okay.

42
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:12,298
What happened?

43
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:17,336
-Terry's down?
-Yeah.

44
00:02:19,438 --> 00:02:21,541
-How is he?
-Took a head shot.

45
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:23,776
Yeah.

46
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,820
I didn't clear the room.

47
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,623
I was point. The first thing
you do is clear the room.

48
00:02:37,623 --> 00:02:39,225
We both missed him.

49
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:55,775
At 1:29 a.m.,
Detective Terry Crowley...

50
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:58,544
...was admitted for a single
gunshot wound to the face.

51
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:01,414
Surgeons made...

52
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:05,318
...every attempt to resuscitate him.

53
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:06,485
Shit.

54
00:03:07,386 --> 00:03:09,655
Ultimately,
their attempts were unsuccessful.

55
00:03:11,123 --> 00:03:14,527
Detective Crowley was pronounced dead
at 2:13 this morning.

56
00:03:19,031 --> 00:03:20,299
No!

57
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:22,468
Damn.

58
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,647
I'm responsible.

59
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,299
I'm responsible.

60
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:54,067
Responsible how?

61
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,670
It was my operation,
and I called the shots.

62
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,305
What could you have done differently?

63
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:00,874
Terry asked me to move him up.

64
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:03,577
-He was part of your team.
-He wasn't ready for this.

65
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:07,314
Eight years as a cop,
a stint in robbery, two commendations.

66
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:10,217
-Sounds to me like he was ready.
-Strike Team's different.

67
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:11,851
Really?

68
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:14,688
We knock down the doors
other cops don't want to.

69
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:19,125
My guys accept the risk because
they know I will take care of them.

70
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:23,430
We go out on a mission, I expect
every single one of them to come home.

71
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:26,466
Anything else is unacceptable.

72
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:32,339
-Why so long?
-They're asking questions.

73
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:34,774
Yeah, how many questions
can they have?

74
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,978
How would it look if I.A.D.
only took five minutes to decide?

75
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:39,346
They have to be thorough.

76
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:41,648
Aceveda's gonna use
this to shut us down.

77
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:44,484
Aceveda's a water boy.
He can't do dick.

78
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:46,086
Why is it taking him so long?

79
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:48,888
This is the last time.
I answered your question.

80
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:52,292
-Detective Vendrell.
-Yeah, that's me.

81
00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:57,631
Just tell them what happened.

82
00:04:58,832 --> 00:04:59,866
Yeah.

83
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:18,018
-What are you doing back here?
-Not our crime scene anymore.

84
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:21,621
-I.A.D. gave us a friendly shove.
-You didn't shove back?

85
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:23,323
Assistant Chief Gilroy gave the order.

86
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,892
-Gilroy? He's there?
-He was.

87
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:29,362
I don't like spending five hours
getting evidence for someone else.

88
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:31,097
Are we on this case, or aren't we?

89
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:33,233
David.

90
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:34,334
Sir.

91
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,636
Your office?

92
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,776
Thanks for your good work
this morning, Claudette.

93
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:45,378
It hasn't been wasted.

94
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:48,381
No, just our time.

95
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:50,750
Sir.

96
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:54,688
Where the hell were you last night?

97
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:57,123
What do you mean?

98
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:59,659
Detective Crowley got shot.
I left you a message.

99
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:00,860
Yeah, I got it.

100
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,296
So?

101
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,332
You didn't say I had to come down.

102
00:06:05,332 --> 00:06:08,868
I shouldn't have to. A fellow
officer was dying in that hospital.

103
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:11,371
I said a prayer for him.

104
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,908
-A prayer?
-Yeah.

105
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:17,110
What?

106
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:20,714
I've been on the job for three weeks,
I didn't even know that guy.

107
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,616
Rule number one, he was a cop.

108
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,485
That means you knew him.

109
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:31,224
Two deaths, two investigations.

110
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:35,695
David, please. You can't have your
cops investigating your cops.

111
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,399
If you clear the Strike Team,
that's gonna smack of favoritism.

112
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,535
If you actually find something,
you'll have a civil war on your hands.

113
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:45,205
Let Internal Affairs do their job.

114
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:56,950
Has anyone sent Department sympathies
to Crowley's family?

115
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,585
I spoke to his mother an hour ago.

116
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:01,287
Someone from our side
should speak at the funeral.

117
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:04,657
-Perhaps you...
-No. He was your man.

118
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:07,427
I'm sure you'll represent us well.

119
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:10,764
You're the first
Mackey brought aboard...

120
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,132
...when he assembled the Strike Team.

121
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:14,901
-We worked things together.
-So there was a comfort level.

122
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:17,103
-Yeah.
-Same with the others?

123
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,706
-Vic knew them, too.
-Detective Crowley?

124
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:22,742
No, he was recommended by someone.
I don't recall who.

125
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,411
So Terry was an outsider?

126
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:27,647
No, he was a new guy,
but once Vic puts you on the team...

127
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:29,282
...then you're on the team.

128
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:34,154
-Hey.
-Hi.

129
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:37,290
Strike Team's getting
the third degree.

130
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,391
Yeah, looks like it.

131
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,794
You're assigned the
crime scene, right?

132
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,729
We're off it now.

133
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,033
The guys are curious.
I said I'd find out what's going on.

134
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:48,134
Any idea?

135
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,836
Looks to me like Vic
and his cowboys...

136
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:51,971
...went in undermanned
with a half-ass plan...

137
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,807
...and managed to get a guy killed.

138
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:56,609
Then again, I'm off the case.

139
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:01,047
Later, okay?

140
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:04,083
Tell him this is L.A.,
not the Wild West.

141
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:12,759
-I'd know those fingernails anywhere.
-How you holding up?

142
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,463
I lost a guy. I don't like it.

143
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,899
-I saw you at the hospital last night.
-I saw you, too.

144
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:23,436
-You had a crowd. I didn't want...
-It's all right.

145
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:26,473
Look, I don't want
you to think that...

146
00:08:26,473 --> 00:08:27,373
I don't.

147
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,917
If you need a break from all this
and want to talk, come find me.

148
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:39,152
That's good to know.

149
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,426
Anytime someone kills a cop...

150
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:49,262
...scumbags get it into their heads
that it's open season.

151
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:51,998
-Police rule number...
-Three.

152
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:54,934
Cop goes down, we re-establish
our dominance on the street.

153
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:57,804
Someone mouths off,
they hit the pavement.

154
00:08:57,804 --> 00:09:00,473
Someone resists,
we make sure they make a pit stop...

155
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:02,041
...at the emergency room.

156
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:07,013
We gotta make sure these assholes
know who's in charge. Right?

157
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:08,681
Loud and clear.

158
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:10,183
What happened to your hand?

159
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:11,918
I put it through a window.

160
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:14,254
Last night during the raid?

161
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:17,023
No. After, when I found
out about Terry.

162
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:18,558
Is it all right?

163
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,360
Yeah.

164
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,096
Cut up pretty bad, though.
Any tendon damage?

165
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:25,832
Can we just get this
the hell over with, please?

166
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:39,412
Mackey sent Terry to get killed.
You don't know that.

167
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,713
Please.

168
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:42,715
Cops get killed in the line of duty.

169
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:46,152
Did you tell anyone
Terry was trying to take down Mackey?

170
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:47,220
Did you?

171
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,689
-David...
-I didn't, and Terry's dead.

172
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:51,157
I followed protocol.

173
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:52,325
Protocol.

174
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:55,662
Things that Terry
wanted, a job, a car,...

175
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:57,363
...I'm not authorized
to sign off on.

176
00:09:57,363 --> 00:10:01,034
-So you broke the circle.
-I sent his requests up the ladder.

177
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:04,671
-This is the Justice Department.
-So they can be trusted?

178
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,173
-I've got to go to I.A.D.
-Why?

179
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:09,943
To let them know
exactly why Mackey wanted Terry dead.

180
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:12,979
-You can't do that.
-They'll let him walk, Moses.

181
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:15,214
If they have motive,
they'll dig deeper.

182
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:17,617
You initiated an
off-the-books...

183
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,053
...investigation into
one of your own men.

184
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:22,021
You come forward, your career's dead.

185
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:25,858
We sent Terry to his own death.
What am I supposed to do?

186
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:27,594
What do you hope to accomplish?

187
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:30,597
It won't prove that Vic set Terry up.

188
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:33,933
You'll lose the power you've
worked your whole life to acquire.

189
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:37,670
I'm not gonna let him
get away with it.

190
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:45,812
There is an epitaph
for an unknown soldier that goes:

191
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:50,249
"Do not stand on my grave and weep.
For I am not there, I do not sleep."

192
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,386
"With my brothers in the field,
I kneel.

193
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:57,423
Their lives, my merit.
"My death, their zeal."

194
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:01,094
I believe these words do express...

195
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:03,262
...the sentiments
of Detective Terry Crowley.

196
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:07,033
A good man and an
exemplary police officer...

197
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:09,736
...who served his community
and his department...

198
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:13,940
...with dignity, loyalty, and courage.

199
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:18,311
<i>In the brief time that I was
</i>fortunate enough to work with him...

200
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:20,279
...I came to know him
as a man who embraced life...

201
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:23,449
<i>...adored his friends and family...</i>

202
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:25,752
...and loved being a cop.

203
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:28,655
"I am the resurrection and the light."

204
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:31,557
"He that believeth in me."

205
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:33,426
"Even though he were dead."

206
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:34,927
"Yet, shall he live."

207
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:36,429
-Amen.
-Yes, Lord.

208
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:39,165
"The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want."

209
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:42,335
"He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures."

210
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:44,570
"He leadeth me beside
the still waters."

211
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,839
We will miss his service
and his good nature.

212
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:51,377
And I know I speak on behalf of
the entire force when I say...

213
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:55,448
...Terry, our lives are your merit...

214
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:58,818
...and your memory gives us zeal.

215
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,022
"He leadeth me beside
the still waters."

216
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:04,891
"He restoreth my soul."

217
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,327
"Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death."

218
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:09,896
"I will fear no evil."

219
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,531
"For thou art with me."

220
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:14,667
"Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me."

221
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:18,037
Fire!

222
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:20,740
Fire!

223
00:12:24,711 --> 00:12:28,815
-Baby, I'm sorry! Mama's sorry!
-It's all right, now.

224
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:32,185
-Mama's sorry, baby!
-It's gonna be all right.

225
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:37,623
What are you doing?

226
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:40,626
-What?
-Save it for the car ride, Shane.

227
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,562
What's the matter with you?

228
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:44,464
I didn't expect to see
his mother here...

229
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:46,866
He had a mom. So what?

230
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,034
So what did we do?

231
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:50,169
What we had to.

232
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,740
-Christ, come on, man.
-Enough. Come on.

233
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,374
I'm cold, man.

234
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:59,412
Look, we made him one of us,
and what did he do?

235
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:01,647
-What did he do?
-He turned rat.

236
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:03,649
He tried to stick us both in a cage...

237
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:06,018
...with the same goddamn animals
we fight every day.

238
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:07,787
Now, did I enjoy it? No.

239
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:11,657
Did it need to be done?
You're goddamn right it did.

240
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,994
Now, listen to me...

241
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:18,598
...we're gonna ride this out. Right?

242
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,502
I'm so sorry for your loss.

243
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:50,864
-Sir, step back.
-It's cool. I called you.

244
00:13:50,864 --> 00:13:53,066
-Step away from the body.
-I need the money he owes me.

245
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:54,634
Don't make me warn you again.

246
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:57,537
-He's got my cash.
-I'm not gonna warn you again.

247
00:13:57,537 --> 00:14:00,106
-I need the money he owes me.
-What'd she say?

248
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:02,242
-Let's go!
-What?

249
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:08,248
I'm a good Samaritan here!

250
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:09,849
What were you doing to the body?

251
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,285
I heard he had the $100 he owed me...

252
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:14,287
...so I come here
and see somebody shot him!

253
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:16,956
So I went down the block
and called for 911...

254
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:19,259
...and come back here to get my money.

255
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:22,695
Jesus, Julien, this guy's still alive.
This is 1-Tango-13.

256
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,931
I need a R.A. to respond.

257
00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:26,499
Keep fighting, man!

258
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:28,535
Keep fighting!
I'll collect from you later!

259
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:29,502
Let's go.

260
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:46,119
Shane barely touched his pork chops.
I don't think he's doing well.

261
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:48,922
He's gonna be fine.
He don't seem fine.

262
00:14:48,922 --> 00:14:50,657
It hasn't even been a week yet.

263
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:53,359
I'm coming, sweetie.

264
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,796
It's like he blames himself
for the whole thing.

265
00:14:56,796 --> 00:14:59,833
It's not normal.
I mean, it's not like he killed Terry.

266
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:18,751
Ace of clubs.

267
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,987
I'm sitting poolside
with this guy named Frank...

268
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:23,122
-Transvestite?
-He's buying drinks.

269
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:24,290
That ugly one?

270
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,426
Yeah, the guy that I
always hang out with.

271
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:29,596
-50 years old!
-You gotta be joking me!

272
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,130
You holding out on me, Shane?

273
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:33,933
I got the fresh meat.

274
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,269
This here's Terry.
He comes to us from Robbery.

275
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:40,106
-Robbery?
-You mean, like, the fag squad, man?

276
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,808
They ran out of fresh asses
over there...

277
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:45,144
...so I figured I'd try you
prom queens on for size.

278
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:48,882
If you're looking for fresh asses,
I'd cross Shane off your list.

279
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:51,618
Stop it, mister. Stop it!

280
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:56,022
It looks like it'll be a blast
to run with you guys.

281
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:58,424
-Just make sure you keep up.
-I'll try.

282
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:00,793
Don't let these pussies
haze you too bad either.

283
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:04,364
We love you pretty boys from Robbery.

284
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:06,933
-Know how to play pitch?
-No.

285
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:08,201
You bring your wallet?

286
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:11,004
Don't let them stick you with Shane.
He always loses.

287
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,541
-'Cause you're cheaters.
-And he's a crybaby.

288
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:16,276
-You're all...
-Shut up!

289
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:18,144
Don't trust one of these guys.

290
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:20,847
You know what?
He's the worst player in here.

291
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:25,652
To infinity and beyond!

292
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:28,821
Okay, Captain Infinity...

293
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,224
...let's get you ready for school.
Come on.

294
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:37,363
Body was over there. We found one
shell casing a few feet away.

295
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:38,731
How's the victim?

296
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:41,100
Paramedic says
he's swirling down the drain.

297
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,536
-Who said that? Randy?
-Yeah.

298
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:45,838
Sounds like Randy. Cynical bastard.

299
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,540
Does the rookie ever talk?

300
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:50,143
Yeah, he talks.

301
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,813
-What does this tell you?
-Ma'am?

302
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:56,950
You're our first eyes and ears
on a crime scene.

303
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,585
What does this one tell you?

304
00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:09,829
Overturned carts, footprints,
clear sign of a struggle.

305
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,198
Actually, the struggle occurred
after we arrived.

306
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:16,869
A guy was going through
the victim's pockets.

307
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,372
After repeated requests to stop,
I pulled him off the body.

308
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:23,376
Knocking over the churro cart
and getting sugar spread all over?

309
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:25,712
Yes, ma'am.

310
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:27,647
Actually, it was my fault.
I should've...

311
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:32,018
I hope this isn't the way you teach a
trainee how to preserve a crime scene.

312
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:34,654
This is how murderers go free, son.

313
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:42,795
Don't take it hard. She's in a pissy
mood 'cause it's her birthday.

314
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,568
Did we...

315
00:17:49,002 --> 00:17:50,269
Is this scheduled?

316
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:52,672
No.

317
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:55,408
Frances came by
to give me her preliminary report.

318
00:17:55,842 --> 00:17:58,244
I wanted you to get a
sneak peek at it, too.

319
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,912
We wrapped up the interviews.

320
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,681
I'll fast-track ballistics...

321
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:04,651
...and get you a final copy
in the next couple of weeks.

322
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:07,020
Bottom line, it wasn't
a model operation,...

323
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,255
...but it wasn't a crime, either.

324
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,691
Vic and his boys look
okay on this one.

325
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:12,759
Really?

326
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:15,995
The drug-dealer's girlfriend
confirms the team's account.

327
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:18,297
She puts the gun that
killed Crowley...

328
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:20,900
...in the dealer's hands
seconds before the shooting.

329
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:25,738
Thanks for the fast work, Frances.

330
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:32,445
She must be good.

331
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,380
Two men killed,
a dozen rounds fired...

332
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,816
...no ballistics,
and she's already making her call.

333
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:40,253
It's a preliminary report, David.

334
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:43,356
I just don't want us accused
of whitewashing anything.

335
00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:44,824
The last thing we need...

336
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:47,460
...is another chapter
in the Rodney King-O.J. book.

337
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,629
I don't wanna be a chapter
in that book, either.

338
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:53,800
I'll make sure she doesn't
get lazy on this one, okay?

339
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:57,236
It was a great eulogy, by the way.

340
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,373
It was very nice.

341
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:05,111
-If my dad dies, it's all my fault.
-Why's that?

342
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:09,782
Dad wanted me to go to college
around here. Live at home.

343
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,652
He's a vendor.
He doesn't make much money.

344
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:14,687
But I wanted Stanford.

345
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:18,491
I had gotten a scholarship,
but it didn't cover everything.

346
00:19:19,092 --> 00:19:21,227
There was still books, housing.

347
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,630
When he found out,
he said if that was my dream...

348
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:26,966
...he'd make it happen.

349
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,535
That's when he stopped paying.

350
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:32,004
-Stopped paying what?
-Protection money.

351
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,843
This bully in the neighborhood
made all the vendors pay.

352
00:19:38,478 --> 00:19:42,014
-My father wasn't licensed, so...
-So he didn't go to the police.

353
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,550
I told him he couldn't
stop paying the guy...

354
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,553
...but he said it was
the only way I could go to Stanford.

355
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:52,291
He was so proud when I had gotten in.

356
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:57,964
I begged him to pay the money, but...

357
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:05,037
The thug that did this to my dad...

358
00:20:05,605 --> 00:20:07,073
...can you guys really get him?

359
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,176
We can try. Who is he?

360
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:11,844
His name's Marlon Demrall.

361
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,788
-Marlon Demrall?
-Yeah. So?

362
00:20:21,788 --> 00:20:24,857
-You need to come with us.
-Thanks, but I'll pass.

363
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:28,127
You can go peacefully or not.

364
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:29,228
Let's go.

365
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,898
How 'bout I don't go at all?
What's the emergency, brother?

366
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:33,599
Questioning in a shooting.

367
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,001
-When?
-Today.

368
00:20:35,001 --> 00:20:36,969
I didn't shoot nobody today.

369
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:39,272
-What're you doin' to him?
-Come on, man.

370
00:20:39,272 --> 00:20:41,874
Get the camcorder!
They're taking Marlon away!

371
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:44,243
-What is wrong with you?
-Stay inside.

372
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:47,446
-Let him go. He didn't do it.
-He's my son's father!

373
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:49,182
I didn't shoot nobody.

374
00:20:49,182 --> 00:20:52,251
Right, yeah. You didn't do anything.

375
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,553
You a brother?

376
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:55,655
Or did you become one of them?

377
00:20:55,655 --> 00:20:58,024
Look at what you're
doing to a brother!

378
00:20:58,024 --> 00:20:59,959
-He's not my brother.
-Let go!

379
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:02,295
Mama! Get the camcorder!
They're taking Marlon!

380
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:04,063
You got nothin' to do today?

381
00:21:04,063 --> 00:21:05,364
He did not...

382
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:07,633
You ain't nothin' but a Uncle Tom!

383
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:08,801
Uncle Tom?

384
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:11,804
That's right. If the Oreo
wrapper fits, wear it, brother.

385
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:13,239
Shut up.

386
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:15,274
Don't go making it black
and white, Marlon.

387
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,443
Take pictures!
Smile for the camera!

388
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,178
Goddamn cops!

389
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:45,304
But I'm like, where am
I supposed to find...

390
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,640
...a dental dam at
2:00 in the morning?

391
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,008
What's a dental dam?

392
00:21:49,008 --> 00:21:51,677
It's a rubber for your mouth
when you go down on a chick.

393
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:53,012
Are you serious?

394
00:21:53,012 --> 00:21:56,215
If you need a dental dam,
I gotta question what your face...

395
00:21:56,215 --> 00:21:58,117
...is doing down there
in the first place.

396
00:21:58,117 --> 00:22:00,519
She had made a specific request.

397
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:03,256
Sounds like a petri dish
with legs to me.

398
00:22:03,256 --> 00:22:06,392
I'd invest in a couple
of syringes of penicillin.

399
00:22:06,392 --> 00:22:10,129
So I find this all-night
Vietnamese store that carries them.

400
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:14,133
Leave it to Charlie to put
the dental dams with the toothpaste.

401
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:15,301
Are you serious?

402
00:22:15,301 --> 00:22:16,535
I rush back.

403
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:19,505
I slap this thing on,
and I am goin' to town.

404
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:22,141
I swear, I'm like Gene Simmons
on that.

405
00:22:22,141 --> 00:22:25,611
I was like the tao of poon,
I swear to God.

406
00:22:25,611 --> 00:22:29,515
And she's like,
"I don't feel anything."

407
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:33,352
And you're like,
"Really? 'Cause that's my dick."

408
00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:38,724
Have you ever actually tried
to use one of these things?

409
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:41,093
I guess you and me
dated a different breed of woman.

410
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:43,429
Down and dirty. No pun intended.

411
00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:45,164
Don't make me hurt you.

412
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:07,386
-What time is lunch here?
-Shut up.

413
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:10,656
You worked me up an appetite.
Tom here could use a bite, too.

414
00:23:10,656 --> 00:23:12,658
-Sir to you.
-Yes, sir.

415
00:23:12,658 --> 00:23:14,560
Uncle Tom is looking very hungry.

416
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,896
Detectives, meet Marlon Demrall.

417
00:23:17,797 --> 00:23:19,699
-Pleasure.
-Shut up.

418
00:23:19,699 --> 00:23:21,934
Is that the only word
you ladies know?

419
00:23:21,934 --> 00:23:23,269
Enjoy.

420
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:24,904
Happy birthday, by the way.

421
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:28,441
-You told her?
-No.

422
00:23:29,342 --> 00:23:31,243
Yes. By accident.

423
00:23:33,446 --> 00:23:34,914
Come with me, Marlon.

424
00:23:37,116 --> 00:23:39,318
Whatever you say, birthday girl.

425
00:23:39,318 --> 00:23:40,619
Hey, Lowe.

426
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:42,655
You gonna grab a beer with us tonight?

427
00:23:43,055 --> 00:23:44,924
Can't. I've got other plans.

428
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,459
What's with your partner?

429
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:49,795
Can't spend quality time
with his fellow boys in blue?

430
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:51,464
I'm just going to church tonight.

431
00:23:51,464 --> 00:23:53,232
God can wait.

432
00:23:53,232 --> 00:23:55,568
Tonight, my friend,
you get your first b-and-b.

433
00:23:56,235 --> 00:23:59,839
-What's a b-and-b?
-It's a tradition we have here.

434
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:01,640
Nothing like your very first one.

435
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:05,011
Be at the motor pool at
the end of the shift.

436
00:24:05,011 --> 00:24:08,347
-You skip out on us, it's your ass.
-Let's get out of here.

437
00:24:08,347 --> 00:24:09,782
What's a b-and-b?

438
00:24:10,249 --> 00:24:13,519
It's stupid and juvenile
and the sooner you get it over with...

439
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:16,188
...the sooner you'll be accepted
by Jackson and the rest.

440
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:17,823
Why should I care what they think?

441
00:24:19,492 --> 00:24:20,926
Rule number seven...

442
00:24:21,894 --> 00:24:23,929
...those guys might be
overgrown frat boys,...

443
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:25,531
...but might someday be
the only thing...

444
00:24:25,531 --> 00:24:26,999
...that comes between
you and a bullet.

445
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:29,668
What y'all got to eat around here?

446
00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:31,437
How 'bout a nice churro?

447
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:33,839
You like churros, Marlon?

448
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:35,674
Yeah, that sugary shit is all right.

449
00:24:36,442 --> 00:24:39,145
But what I'm really jonesing for
is a cheeseburger.

450
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,614
Let me see if I can accommodate you.

451
00:24:41,614 --> 00:24:42,782
My man.

452
00:24:48,187 --> 00:24:50,122
Come on, sweet thing.

453
00:24:50,122 --> 00:24:53,025
Now I know you got a smile for me
underneath all that.

454
00:24:59,298 --> 00:25:00,399
Dutch?

455
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:03,235
-Dutch?
-Captain.

456
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:07,440
I could use your help
with an interrogation.

457
00:25:08,074 --> 00:25:11,644
-I'm in the middle of a case.
-Claudette's got it under control.

458
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:14,814
All right.

459
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:20,653
That's what all this is about?
Look, you could have saved me a trip.

460
00:25:20,653 --> 00:25:25,091
Read my lips.
I did not kill Poncho. Okay?

461
00:25:25,091 --> 00:25:27,126
Nivan Gonzalez.

462
00:25:27,126 --> 00:25:30,062
-He's still alive at the moment.
-Whatever.

463
00:25:30,062 --> 00:25:31,931
I didn't shoot
nobody this morning,...

464
00:25:31,931 --> 00:25:33,632
...but I'll turn you on
to who did, though.

465
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:35,734
-Will you?
-Yeah.

466
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:39,772
-But I want something first.
-And what is that?

467
00:25:39,772 --> 00:25:42,074
A cheeseburger! I'm hungry as hell!

468
00:25:42,074 --> 00:25:43,976
Talk first, then you eat.

469
00:25:43,976 --> 00:25:45,077
Come on.

470
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:49,048
All right.

471
00:25:49,849 --> 00:25:53,352
I had a protection thing
going on with those churro chumps.

472
00:25:53,786 --> 00:25:55,821
It was a good gig, too.

473
00:25:56,489 --> 00:25:58,023
Till last month.

474
00:25:58,023 --> 00:26:01,127
This new Mexican gang comes in,
packing some serious heat...

475
00:26:01,127 --> 00:26:03,762
...tells me they movin'
in on my business.

476
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:05,631
And what gang was this?

477
00:26:06,365 --> 00:26:08,834
Call themselves the Los Magnificos.

478
00:26:09,502 --> 00:26:11,971
See, that's what's wrong
with this country.

479
00:26:11,971 --> 00:26:14,306
I'm prime example numero uno.

480
00:26:14,707 --> 00:26:18,010
I'm trying to make a serious buck,
and then comes some wetback...

481
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:19,478
...that's taking away my job.

482
00:26:19,478 --> 00:26:21,680
-Your job?
-My job.

483
00:26:22,481 --> 00:26:26,152
Your job was illegally
shaking down churro vendors.

484
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:30,222
Look, a job is a job, lady.

485
00:26:31,157 --> 00:26:34,660
Now, I like mine well done.

486
00:26:35,161 --> 00:26:37,763
Just like me. With everything.

487
00:26:38,364 --> 00:26:39,532
No onions.

488
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:41,433
They give me a rash.

489
00:26:42,635 --> 00:26:44,570
I don't find you funny.

490
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:48,140
You lookin' for me?

491
00:26:48,574 --> 00:26:50,509
We'd like to ask you some questions.

492
00:26:54,046 --> 00:26:55,214
About what?

493
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:56,982
About how Terry died.

494
00:26:57,883 --> 00:26:59,685
You I.A.D. now?

495
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:01,887
Seems right up your alley.

496
00:27:01,887 --> 00:27:03,856
I don't feel they
checked every angle.

497
00:27:03,856 --> 00:27:06,492
-So now you got questions.
-I've got a few.

498
00:27:07,026 --> 00:27:10,529
What's stopping me from having
my P.B.A. rep tell you to blow me?

499
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:12,131
Nothing.

500
00:27:12,698 --> 00:27:15,034
If Vic Mackey
wants to hide behind a lawyer...

501
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:17,336
...then that's the way it'll be.

502
00:27:23,442 --> 00:27:26,478
You got questions? Fine.

503
00:27:28,681 --> 00:27:30,616
Ask your goddamn questions.

504
00:27:33,219 --> 00:27:36,923
-Why'd you go in without more backup?
-A battalion of cops makes noise.

505
00:27:36,923 --> 00:27:38,491
It's called the element of surprise.

506
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:40,893
lmagine my surprise
when I heard your guy died.

507
00:27:40,893 --> 00:27:44,297
Those of us who venture out past
our desks sometimes get shot at.

508
00:27:44,297 --> 00:27:46,733
More firepower wouldn't
have tipped him off.

509
00:27:46,733 --> 00:27:49,769
Who should I have had
watching our backs? You?

510
00:27:49,769 --> 00:27:51,971
I'd hate to have
to change your diaper afterwards.

511
00:27:51,971 --> 00:27:54,173
Better than burying one of your own.

512
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:55,641
So you fired at the dealer,...

513
00:27:55,641 --> 00:27:57,477
...the dealer returned
fire, hitting Terry.

514
00:27:57,477 --> 00:28:01,481
No. Like I told I.A.D.,
Two-Time shot Terry...

515
00:28:01,481 --> 00:28:03,316
...then Shane and I returned fire.

516
00:28:03,316 --> 00:28:04,851
Sounds textbook to me.

517
00:28:06,152 --> 00:28:07,386
That's all we got.

518
00:28:10,923 --> 00:28:12,158
Thanks for your time.

519
00:28:18,331 --> 00:28:19,799
That's all we've got?

520
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:22,435
Was that supposed to make him
spontaneously confess?

521
00:28:22,435 --> 00:28:24,737
No. It's supposed to
make him feel safe.

522
00:28:24,737 --> 00:28:28,708
Now we go after the
weak link in the chain.

523
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:31,444
Who's the weak link?

524
00:28:35,314 --> 00:28:36,382
What was that all about?

525
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:39,185
Aceveda is spinning
his wheels, as usual.

526
00:28:41,988 --> 00:28:43,122
Enter.

527
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:48,795
What can you tell me about a new
gang called Los Magnificos?

528
00:28:48,795 --> 00:28:50,363
They're not so new...

529
00:28:50,997 --> 00:28:53,966
...they been clawing up the food chain
for the last six months.

530
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:57,603
Someone from the gang
pulled the trigger on my churro guy.

531
00:28:57,603 --> 00:28:59,205
Any bushes you can beat?

532
00:29:00,106 --> 00:29:02,441
Looks like we've been invited
to the party, ladies.

533
00:29:03,042 --> 00:29:04,210
Let's go.

534
00:29:06,646 --> 00:29:08,347
I hear it's your birthday.

535
00:29:09,115 --> 00:29:10,349
Happy birthday.

536
00:29:13,186 --> 00:29:15,354
I need to ask Shane a few questions.

537
00:29:15,354 --> 00:29:17,657
-Me?
-I need 10 minutes.

538
00:29:17,657 --> 00:29:19,325
I'll send him to catch up with you.

539
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:21,627
I'm cool.

540
00:29:21,627 --> 00:29:23,529
I'm gonna grab a Coke first.
Do you need anything?

541
00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:24,630
No.

542
00:29:38,911 --> 00:29:40,379
How's the paint brush, Van Bro?

543
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:42,782
Don't be coming around here
unless you lookin' to buy.

544
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:44,116
And no more freebies.

545
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:46,853
You want info,
you have to buy something this time.

546
00:29:46,853 --> 00:29:48,154
All right.

547
00:29:48,154 --> 00:29:51,257
-Lem, pick the poison.
-What do I know about art, man?

548
00:29:52,058 --> 00:29:53,192
Ronnie?

549
00:29:55,361 --> 00:29:57,330
I like the one with the clouds.

550
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:58,798
You got a place for it?

551
00:29:59,565 --> 00:30:01,000
Yeah, I guess.

552
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,835
All right. How much?

553
00:30:03,836 --> 00:30:05,338
Gimme $100.

554
00:30:08,007 --> 00:30:09,976
And don't be hangin' it
in no bathroom, neither.

555
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:15,748
Looking for a Los Mag.
Shot up a churro vendor.

556
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:22,722
The people say
amigo didn't want to pay his freight.

557
00:30:22,722 --> 00:30:24,557
He ignored a couple of warnings.

558
00:30:24,557 --> 00:30:27,226
Los Mags sent in a baby banger
to do the dirty deed.

559
00:30:28,494 --> 00:30:30,029
Earned him his stripes.

560
00:30:31,063 --> 00:30:32,932
Initiation shooting?

561
00:30:32,932 --> 00:30:34,901
Things they got these kids doing.

562
00:30:36,102 --> 00:30:39,105
Did you have to bake a batch
of brownies back in your day, Van Bro?

563
00:30:40,573 --> 00:30:43,309
Getting into life was a lot more fun
than getting out.

564
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:46,178
I heard you lost a
man a few days back.

565
00:30:47,046 --> 00:30:49,582
-Yeah.
-Tough times, Vic.

566
00:30:50,416 --> 00:30:52,551
I don't know. Maybe someday...

567
00:30:53,052 --> 00:30:54,887
...somebody even win this war.

568
00:30:54,887 --> 00:30:56,422
I intend to.

569
00:30:57,256 --> 00:30:59,091
-See you around, baby.
-All right, man.

570
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:13,706
This little vato ready for the barrio?

571
00:31:24,884 --> 00:31:27,920
The wannabe getting initiated,
he's our shooter.

572
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,288
I'll take him.

573
00:31:29,288 --> 00:31:32,291
Anybody else gets caught in our net,
it's gravy.

574
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:35,494
-Are we goin' in?
-No. His punk ass wants a beating.

575
00:31:35,494 --> 00:31:37,029
I say we let him have it.

576
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,275
What's he saying?

577
00:31:49,275 --> 00:31:50,977
"Welcome to the life."

578
00:32:00,186 --> 00:32:01,587
You were going to be his backup.

579
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:02,989
We were his backup.

580
00:32:02,989 --> 00:32:04,490
Why is Terry dead, then?

581
00:32:05,324 --> 00:32:06,926
Wrong place, wrong time.

582
00:32:06,926 --> 00:32:11,364
Aren't you and Vic supposed to be
these kick-ass top cops?

583
00:32:12,198 --> 00:32:14,266
How does somebody you're backing up...

584
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:17,570
...get blown away by some
pissant drug dealer?

585
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:19,271
I.A.D. cleared us.

586
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:20,506
I didn't clear you.

587
00:32:21,907 --> 00:32:23,809
It just went bad. That's all.

588
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:26,012
You lie.

589
00:32:26,012 --> 00:32:28,447
He squints when he lies.
You do.

590
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:30,516
-No, I don't.
-You're squinting now.

591
00:32:50,169 --> 00:32:51,771
All right. Play time's over.

592
00:32:51,771 --> 00:32:54,407
Last one down the hill
gets to drink the backwash.

593
00:32:54,407 --> 00:32:58,144
All right. We're a go
in three, two, one, go!

594
00:32:58,144 --> 00:32:59,278
Go.

595
00:33:09,455 --> 00:33:10,756
Police!

596
00:33:10,756 --> 00:33:12,324
Stop right there! Freeze!

597
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:35,681
Bienvenido a la vida.

598
00:33:47,927 --> 00:33:49,995
You let Terry get killed.

599
00:33:49,995 --> 00:33:52,398
-Why would we do that?
-You know why.

600
00:33:53,499 --> 00:33:55,067
I.A.D. cleared us.

601
00:33:58,471 --> 00:34:00,606
You know a drug dealer
named Rondell Robinson?

602
00:34:00,606 --> 00:34:01,874
No.

603
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:03,742
You're squinting.
You don't know him?

604
00:34:04,443 --> 00:34:05,778
I know who he is.

605
00:34:06,178 --> 00:34:08,147
I meant I don't know him personally.

606
00:34:08,147 --> 00:34:10,316
So if I had a witness
that saw you and Vic...

607
00:34:10,316 --> 00:34:12,918
...acting real friendly
with Rondell Robinson...

608
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:15,154
-...that would be a lie.
-That's right.

609
00:34:15,154 --> 00:34:18,023
So he didn't see
the three of you at a car wash?

610
00:34:23,796 --> 00:34:26,699
Vic was just puttin' a scare into him.

611
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:28,968
Lettin' him know
that we were watching him.

612
00:34:28,968 --> 00:34:30,903
-So you lied.
-No, I didn't.

613
00:34:30,903 --> 00:34:32,738
I meant something else.

614
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:36,408
Terry knew you were in bed with
Robinson, so he had to die.

615
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:39,545
-Terry was in our team.
-He was your errand boy.

616
00:34:39,545 --> 00:34:41,780
-Bullshit.
-You led Terry there to die.

617
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,115
No, not true.

618
00:34:43,115 --> 00:34:44,917
The one guy who disapproved...

619
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:47,820
...is the only one who didn't
come out of that house alive.

620
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,822
-That's a coincidence?
-Believe what you want.

621
00:34:50,523 --> 00:34:53,125
Terry was gonna turn you in,
so Vic wanted him dead.

622
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:55,060
-Vic needed him dead!
-No!

623
00:34:57,963 --> 00:34:59,165
God.

624
00:34:59,832 --> 00:35:00,966
The shot.

625
00:35:01,534 --> 00:35:04,236
-That's what the last shot was.
-The last shot?

626
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:08,174
Two-Time's girlfriend said
that she heard the last shot...

627
00:35:08,174 --> 00:35:10,309
...10, 15 seconds after the others.

628
00:35:11,377 --> 00:35:14,713
When we approached Two-Time, he moved.

629
00:35:15,347 --> 00:35:17,516
Vic couldn't leave it to chance.

630
00:35:17,516 --> 00:35:21,120
Vic fired once more.
That's the shot that killed Terry.

631
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,722
-No way.
-Vic fired that shot, didn't he?

632
00:35:23,722 --> 00:35:25,558
-No.
-Stop squinting!

633
00:35:26,825 --> 00:35:27,960
I know.

634
00:35:29,261 --> 00:35:30,462
I know.

635
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:41,340
You're wrong.

636
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:45,511
I want Mackey.

637
00:35:45,511 --> 00:35:48,380
-You don't have to go down with him.
-That is not how it happened.

638
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:51,317
Stop lying to me.
I know what happened.

639
00:35:52,952 --> 00:35:54,887
I have a witness, Shane.

640
00:35:55,821 --> 00:35:58,257
He connects you and Vic
with Rondell Robinson.

641
00:35:58,257 --> 00:36:00,226
I have a witness.

642
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:03,629
Give me Vic and your problems end.

643
00:36:06,298 --> 00:36:07,600
Just give me Mackey.

644
00:36:12,238 --> 00:36:15,541
What the hell's going on here?
You've had him here for two hours?

645
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:18,777
-He's making up sick shit about us.
-Wait for me downstairs.

646
00:36:19,144 --> 00:36:22,915
-This whole thing is a joke.
-Grab a sandwich, Dutch-boy.

647
00:36:30,055 --> 00:36:31,490
I know what you did.

648
00:36:33,892 --> 00:36:36,061
Up until now, I've tolerated you.

649
00:36:36,929 --> 00:36:40,566
You come near my men again,
I'm gonna lose patience.

650
00:36:41,834 --> 00:36:42,901
You listening?

651
00:36:46,505 --> 00:36:47,640
I know.

652
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:03,723
The churro guy you shot's in surgery.
They don't know if he'll live.

653
00:37:03,723 --> 00:37:05,925
Tell her you didn't shoot this man.

654
00:37:05,925 --> 00:37:10,029
If you tell me who had you do this,
I might get you into juvie court.

655
00:37:10,029 --> 00:37:13,966
If you wait and he dies, you'll
be tried for murder as an adult.

656
00:37:13,966 --> 00:37:16,536
Please tell her you didn't do this.

657
00:37:16,536 --> 00:37:18,404
-Of course I didn't.
-You see?

658
00:37:18,404 --> 00:37:21,674
I shoot someone,
he don't almost end up dead.

659
00:37:21,674 --> 00:37:23,409
Bitch ends up all dead.

660
00:37:25,378 --> 00:37:28,414
That's your alibi?
If you'd have shot him, he'd be dead?

661
00:37:28,414 --> 00:37:30,283
Hell, yeah. That's my alibi.

662
00:37:38,558 --> 00:37:41,928
Guess what?
Churro guy's actually gonna make it.

663
00:37:42,929 --> 00:37:43,996
Good.

664
00:37:43,996 --> 00:37:47,033
You're not gonna believe what went
down between Aceveda and Mackey.

665
00:37:47,033 --> 00:37:49,669
-I don't want to know.
-Yeah, I know, but this is...

666
00:37:49,669 --> 00:37:51,737
Anyone gets between those two...

667
00:37:51,737 --> 00:37:55,141
...will end up with a hose full
of piss running down his leg.

668
00:37:59,478 --> 00:38:01,380
Good news and bad news.

669
00:38:02,648 --> 00:38:04,150
Bad news is...

670
00:38:05,818 --> 00:38:08,187
...the churro vendor just died.

671
00:38:08,187 --> 00:38:09,689
Good news for your son, though,...

672
00:38:09,689 --> 00:38:11,390
...someone else is taking
credit for the killing.

673
00:38:12,859 --> 00:38:14,327
Thank you, Jesus.

674
00:38:14,327 --> 00:38:16,929
Some guy named Marlon
walked in off the street...

675
00:38:16,929 --> 00:38:20,600
...said your gang was trying
to muscle in on his business...

676
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,435
...so he decided to
show all the vendors...

677
00:38:22,435 --> 00:38:24,103
...your gang couldn't
protect them.

678
00:38:24,103 --> 00:38:25,671
Marlon didn't do no shooting.

679
00:38:25,671 --> 00:38:29,308
He did. Everyone's talking
about how he showed your boys up.

680
00:38:29,308 --> 00:38:31,878
That old man stopped paying us.
That's my shooting!

681
00:38:31,878 --> 00:38:34,380
-He's just looking to piggyback a rep.
-Olman, no.

682
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,816
You're trying
to take credit for it now?

683
00:38:36,816 --> 00:38:37,917
Stop...

684
00:38:37,917 --> 00:38:39,352
I told you if I shot him,
he'd be dead, right?

685
00:38:40,186 --> 00:38:41,487
People need to know.

686
00:38:42,021 --> 00:38:43,723
Los Mags own these streets.

687
00:38:44,724 --> 00:38:47,827
-Who asked you to do the shooting?
-I ain't never telling you that.

688
00:38:49,662 --> 00:38:51,230
These are my brothers now.

689
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:53,399
Do you know what this means?

690
00:38:53,399 --> 00:38:54,800
Means I earned my way in.

691
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,904
No. It means you're going to jail.

692
00:39:04,644 --> 00:39:06,078
At least I'll have family there.

693
00:39:18,624 --> 00:39:21,560
Tell me you didn't reopen an
investigation that wasn't even yours.

694
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,062
There were unanswered questions.

695
00:39:23,062 --> 00:39:25,631
You accused Mackey
of working with a drug dealer.

696
00:39:25,631 --> 00:39:28,167
-Who's your witness?
-Anonymous tip.

697
00:39:28,167 --> 00:39:29,869
Anyone who can corroborate it?

698
00:39:34,106 --> 00:39:35,608
Is there something
I don't know...

699
00:39:35,608 --> 00:39:37,276
...that explains why you're
still pursuing this?

700
00:39:40,713 --> 00:39:41,714
Well?

701
00:39:43,749 --> 00:39:44,817
No.

702
00:39:45,284 --> 00:39:46,485
Then it ends here.

703
00:39:49,789 --> 00:39:50,957
Christ, David.

704
00:39:53,092 --> 00:39:54,593
You're doing a good job.

705
00:39:55,127 --> 00:39:56,762
Chief said so the other day.

706
00:39:59,298 --> 00:40:00,766
Don't lose focus now.

707
00:40:01,767 --> 00:40:02,868
I won't.

708
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:05,771
Good.

709
00:40:05,771 --> 00:40:08,441
Thanks for getting
Captain Ass-lnvader off my back.

710
00:40:08,441 --> 00:40:10,876
It wouldn't kill you
to show him more respect.

711
00:40:10,876 --> 00:40:12,211
Come on.

712
00:40:12,211 --> 00:40:14,613
Vic, the men here take
their cues from you.

713
00:40:14,613 --> 00:40:16,615
I'm just saying dial it down.

714
00:40:16,615 --> 00:40:19,418
I don't do my best work
with him nipping at my heels.

715
00:40:19,418 --> 00:40:21,454
Which is why I'm
watching out for you.

716
00:40:21,454 --> 00:40:22,655
Good.

717
00:40:22,655 --> 00:40:24,657
Question is, are you
watching out for me?

718
00:40:25,257 --> 00:40:26,559
Meaning?

719
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:29,261
My guys tipped you off that Terry
was looking to take you down.

720
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:31,897
Ben, the bust just went bad.

721
00:40:31,897 --> 00:40:34,033
My source at Justice
is all over my ass.

722
00:40:34,033 --> 00:40:36,936
He wants to know if you made us
all accomplices to a murder.

723
00:40:37,903 --> 00:40:41,007
I told him you'd never do that to me.

724
00:40:43,909 --> 00:40:45,011
Would you?

725
00:40:48,147 --> 00:40:50,649
Terry got overeager.
He got himself killed.

726
00:40:52,618 --> 00:40:53,953
End of story?

727
00:40:54,487 --> 00:40:55,888
End of story.

728
00:40:59,358 --> 00:41:00,459
It better be.

729
00:41:13,906 --> 00:41:15,174
Is this from you?

730
00:41:16,509 --> 00:41:19,311
No. I know how you
feel about birthdays.

731
00:41:25,451 --> 00:41:27,019
Denture cream.

732
00:41:28,921 --> 00:41:30,222
Thank you.

733
00:41:31,123 --> 00:41:32,792
'Cause I'm getting old.

734
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,197
I don't see a card.
Anyone want to take credit for this?

735
00:41:38,831 --> 00:41:41,267
-Not me.
-I didn't think so.

736
00:41:42,268 --> 00:41:45,337
-How's the birthday girl doing?
-Don't say that word.

737
00:41:45,337 --> 00:41:48,441
-I came to take you dancing.
-I don't want to go dancing.

738
00:41:48,441 --> 00:41:50,843
Now we gotta do something, honey.

739
00:41:50,843 --> 00:41:52,545
-It's your birthday.
-So?

740
00:41:52,545 --> 00:41:55,981
So, it's ladies night at the Crimson.

741
00:41:57,149 --> 00:42:01,187
I have it on very good authority
that Franklin Green's gonna be there.

742
00:42:04,457 --> 00:42:06,992
-His divorce final?
-Two weeks ago.

743
00:42:13,432 --> 00:42:16,235
I can't let Franklin Green
see me looking like this.

744
00:42:16,235 --> 00:42:19,638
Which is why we'll spruce up first,
then go to the Crimson.

745
00:42:19,638 --> 00:42:23,776
-We too old to be chasing men around.
-I'm not.

746
00:42:23,776 --> 00:42:25,711
Neither am I. Come on.

747
00:42:27,713 --> 00:42:32,585
Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink!

748
00:42:34,787 --> 00:42:37,456
Who said that Jesus
freak couldn't drink?

749
00:42:39,525 --> 00:42:42,027
Your b-and-b's almost
complete, buddy boy.

750
00:42:42,027 --> 00:42:44,497
You had the beer.
Now it's time for the blow.

751
00:42:45,698 --> 00:42:47,833
-You're kidding.
-I kid you not.

752
00:42:47,833 --> 00:42:49,535
She's a badge sucker.

753
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:52,905
What's a badge sucker?

754
00:42:52,905 --> 00:42:55,241
A badge sucker, man.
She digs cops, okay?

755
00:42:55,241 --> 00:42:58,477
She's like the neighborhood
welcoming committee. Listen.

756
00:42:58,477 --> 00:43:00,646
A better hummer you're not gonna find.

757
00:43:00,646 --> 00:43:02,314
-Trust me.
-No...

758
00:43:02,314 --> 00:43:05,518
-I cannot...
-No, stay, listen!

759
00:43:05,518 --> 00:43:07,186
Sit down!

760
00:43:07,186 --> 00:43:10,055
This isn't torture, okay?
We've all gone through this.

761
00:43:10,689 --> 00:43:13,058
Julien, say hi to Betty.

762
00:43:13,058 --> 00:43:16,929
-So this is the new guy?
-Go!

763
00:43:17,997 --> 00:43:19,398
Welcome to the force.

764
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,069
-Handsome.
-And he's lucky, too.

765
00:43:24,069 --> 00:43:28,174
-Wanna go for a walk?
-Fellas, I cannot. No.

766
00:43:29,808 --> 00:43:31,510
Come on, now. I can't!

767
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:32,745
Go!

768
00:43:38,117 --> 00:43:39,485
Give it up, man.

769
00:43:44,256 --> 00:43:45,991
Wait. Come on.

770
00:43:46,525 --> 00:43:48,627
-Come on.
-All right.

771
00:43:49,295 --> 00:43:51,330
Let's get you over here.

772
00:43:51,330 --> 00:43:53,165
Relax, Officer.

773
00:43:54,099 --> 00:43:56,168
This is a lot more fun than roll call.

774
00:44:02,208 --> 00:44:03,976
You don't have to do this.

775
00:44:22,695 --> 00:44:23,896
Yeah.

776
00:44:28,334 --> 00:44:30,502
She love him long time.

777
00:44:31,604 --> 00:44:32,738
Go!

778
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:42,915
Thanks a lot.

779
00:44:53,859 --> 00:44:55,861
You don't put me in
an interrogation room...

780
00:44:55,861 --> 00:44:57,496
...without giving me all the facts.

781
00:44:57,496 --> 00:44:59,531
I wanted them to think
you had nothing.

782
00:44:59,531 --> 00:45:00,899
Then I could take my shot.

783
00:45:00,899 --> 00:45:03,469
You didn't think
they'd respect me enough to fear me?

784
00:45:06,805 --> 00:45:08,607
No. I didn't.

785
00:45:09,942 --> 00:45:12,011
That's pretty shitty.

786
00:45:12,011 --> 00:45:13,279
Sorry.

787
00:45:16,315 --> 00:45:20,152
You really think Vic had something
to do with Terry dying?
