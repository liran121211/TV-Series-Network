00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,168
<i>Previously on The Shield:</i>

2
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:03,470
I said I'm a cop!

3
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:04,704
And I'm a cop killer.

4
00:00:04,704 --> 00:00:06,873
-Do you trust me?
-Yeah.

5
00:00:06,873 --> 00:00:08,541
Then you'll believe me
when I tell you,...

6
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:11,277
...you don't have to look
over your should anymore.

7
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:13,112
I took care of it.

8
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:16,149
I'm concerned about Matthew.

9
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:18,184
Well, he is a little shy.

10
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:20,053
What I'm trying to say is...

11
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:22,455
-...I think there's a problem.
-What kind of problem?

12
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:25,992
Some a developmental paediatrician
should diagnose.

13
00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:27,193
A neurologist, maybe.

14
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:30,964
-I'm not gay.
-I wasn't gay either.

15
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:33,800
Until the day I just
admitted that I was.

16
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:35,869
Okay.

17
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:37,403
Okay.

18
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:40,874
It's safe.

19
00:00:41,674 --> 00:00:44,177
We killed a cop.

20
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:48,548
Lem and Ronnie failed
to clear the room.

21
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,416
Two-Time killed Terry.

22
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:53,987
Get over it.
Don't bring it up again.

23
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:00,687
Is there anything
you're not allergic to?

24
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:04,457
Sheet metal.

25
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:17,270
This coke's really pink?

26
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,340
No, not really. It just looks pink
in the right kind of light.

27
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,409
-Cool.
-Yeah. It's Peruvian.

28
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:25,378
Rondell said the
street ain't seen blow...

29
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:27,347
...this strong since
Grandmaster Flash.

30
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:28,648
What's that?

31
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,351
Never mind.

32
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:34,988
How much time are
they giving these...

33
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,123
...days for installing
an illegal wiretap?

34
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:39,459
Not as long as some of
this fruit's been here.

35
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:42,061
These Third World cavemen
ever hear of a Ralphs?

36
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:47,734
-Shane. Shane, Shane, Shane.
-Here we go.

37
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:58,378
-Yo.
-Yeah. Bakers are home, boys...

38
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:01,481
...and they're coming through
the front door. Exit the ass.

39
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,695
This is gonna be a sweet
win for us, boys.

40
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,331
Aceveda gets a gold star,
we get a little breathing room.

41
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:21,534
-Rondell gets product.
-The retirement fund keeps growing.

42
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:24,437
-Who's saving for retirement?
-Can you say "ski-doo"?

43
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:26,639
All right.
Hey, we're wired.

44
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:38,451
The Armenians speak Armenian.

45
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:43,790
-Theo Chorlian?
-Yeah?

46
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,092
Professor Gaffney says
you'd be the perfect guy...

47
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:48,261
...to help us with
a special investigation.

48
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:50,963
-What kind of special...?
-You'll love it. Come with us.

49
00:03:50,963 --> 00:03:53,966
He'll meet you back
at the dorm. All right?

50
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:57,904
These guys are
Eastern Armenian.

51
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:01,207
-So?
-So they got accents.

52
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,544
You understand what
they're saying or not?

53
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:10,450
The gardener delivers six loaves
of Agien white bread?

54
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,086
-Does that make sense?
-When and where?

55
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:18,157
Will arrive here
tomorrow night, 9:30.

56
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:20,993
-At the bakery.
-Bakery? What kind of bread this is?

57
00:04:20,993 --> 00:04:23,029
-Thanks, kid.
-What's this all about?

58
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:25,965
-Who are these guys?
-National security.

59
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:28,101
Don't tell a goddamn soul.

60
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:34,140
You've been a big help.
Thanks.

61
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,543
Okay, Bingham,
here's the story.

62
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:40,513
You were driving these gothic
goons back from LAX...

63
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:43,649
...when you overheard them talking
about the shipment of cocaine.

64
00:04:43,649 --> 00:04:47,954
I won't bore you with the details.
Being such a concerned citizen...

65
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:51,190
...you felt compelled to share
this information with the authorities.

66
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:55,461
All we need now is for you
to sign your statement.

67
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:57,563
Here you go.

68
00:04:58,297 --> 00:05:00,299
Anything to take
a bite out of crime.

69
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,472
Judge Weiss is waiting.

70
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:09,976
Well, thank you for helping us
get our nice legal warrant.

71
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:14,614
-Feels good to do the right thing.
-Yes, it does.

72
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:41,941
-Showtime?
-There's seats still available.

73
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:44,444
I saw the warrant,
heard you were rolling out.

74
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:47,046
I'm backing you up
with a few uniform patrols.

75
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,849
That's not how we do it.

76
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:55,021
Well, that's how I do it. I wanna make
sure everyone comes home this time.

77
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:57,624
The more the merrier.

78
00:05:58,725 --> 00:05:59,959
Good.

79
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,041
-Somebody here to see me?
-Over there.

80
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,281
What are you doing here?

81
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:23,616
Well, I'm here to
report a hit and run.

82
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:25,518
-What?
-I was struck by...

83
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:27,453
...a beautiful black man
driving a big red...

84
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:30,456
-Not here. You have got to go.
-Look, you haven't called.

85
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:33,560
-I just wanna make sure you're okay.
-I'm fine, now go.

86
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,361
Why are you
shutting me out then?

87
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,933
I'll call you later.

88
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:42,702
I don't wanna just hear your voice.
I wanna see you.

89
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:47,874
I'll stop by if you leave right now.

90
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:50,376
Okay.

91
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:56,015
But if you don't show,
I'm gonna be back here tomorrow...

92
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:59,218
...and the day after,
and the day after that.

93
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:03,756
-Danny.
-Hey, Dutch.

94
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:07,226
Here are those notes and study
guides for the sergeant's exam.

95
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:08,428
Great.

96
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,764
The test is at 7 a.m. In San Pedro.
What's up with that?

97
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,933
Lack of sleep thins the herd.

98
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,369
I barely know my name before 8.

99
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:21,774
Got lesson plans, practice tests.
I organized it all.

100
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:24,177
Should make it easier
for us to review it.

101
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:27,480
-Thanks. This is a big help.
-When do you wanna go over that?

102
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:30,717
-Tomorrow night good?
-Good for me.

103
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:35,088
-9:00, my place?
-Your place, perfect. No distractions.

104
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:42,495
A study date? What kind of
backdoor con is that?

105
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:44,731
I'm helping her study
for the sergeant's exam.

106
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:48,334
Unless the first question is,
"Will you sleep with me?"...

107
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:49,702
...you're wasting your time.

108
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:20,533
Okay. Hang back.
Once we're inside...

109
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:23,736
...cover the exits.
I'll call you out.

110
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:58,671
Police, freeze!
Put that gun down!

111
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:00,540
Get it down!
Put the gun down!

112
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,942
Put your hands in the air!
Put them on your head!

113
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:05,344
On your head!
Put your hands on your head!

114
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,449
All right, we're clear.
We're clear.

115
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:13,786
-He's done. Cuff him.
-Ronnie.

116
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:16,556
-All right, call them up.
<i>-We're secure.</i>

117
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,058
<i>One dead Armenian,
</i>three to take home.

118
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:22,328
-Copy that. Code Four. Code Four.
-We're Code Four.

119
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:24,297
King, call for a body wagon.

120
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:25,832
-Cover that door.
-I'm there.

121
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:27,100
-Cover the back.
-Okay.

122
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,169
No one in or out not wearing a badge.
Mike, come with me.

123
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:38,478
-That don't look pink.
-It's not the right kind of light.

124
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:40,146
Get this stuff downstairs.

125
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:46,853
-Load them up.
-Thank you, sir.

126
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:49,522
Easy with that. Don't spill it
all over the place.

127
00:09:57,563 --> 00:10:00,767
Hey. Jesus Christ here was
the shooter. Keep him separate.

128
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,335
Gotcha.
Come on.

129
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,604
Okay, Ronnie,
you got the ball.

130
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:08,174
You know how much fat
is in that cookie?

131
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,343
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

132
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:14,580
<i>No, I'm serious.</i>

133
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,949
<i>Those are sugarcoated lard balls.</i>

134
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:20,019
-Have you looked at your waist lately?
-Come on, Shane.

135
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:21,888
Get to it.

136
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:28,528
Bag it.

137
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:30,963
And...

138
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:34,033
...bag it.

139
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:43,109
Don't want my kids to end up
in U.C. Northridge hell.

140
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:47,113
-Hey, I went to Northridge.
-Majored in "Where's the Keg At"?

141
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:50,950
-That's funny.
-Deliver this package to Rondell.

142
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:53,252
Right.

143
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:09,268
Hey, nice job, guys.

144
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:14,507
Way to go, guys.

145
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:17,410
Four bricks of Peruvian pink, people.

146
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:02,889
Hey, angel.

147
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,360
-What?
-You're five hours late.

148
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,594
It's work.

149
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:10,296
Yeah, well, I have
to go to work too...

150
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:13,199
-...in about five hours.
-Hey.

151
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:15,434
What? We just took down
some bad guys.

152
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:18,170
-I'm feeling it.
-Well, it doesn't mean I have to.

153
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:21,140
-Just give me 15 minutes.
-A marathon.

154
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:24,543
-15 minutes. 15 minutes.
-All right.

155
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:31,117
-Four keys. Nice bust.
-Yes. Very nice.

156
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:39,258
-Don't see any money in the log.
-That's because there wasn't any.

157
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:42,628
-Major drug deal and no cash?
-Nope.

158
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:46,399
Just a million in powder,
a killer and two drug collars.

159
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,334
Sorry. Slow night.

160
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:53,472
I guess if that's what you put in the
book, then that's what you found.

161
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:55,675
Look, it was a delivery, not a buy.

162
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,817
Why is it that no matter what I do,
you always assume the worst?

163
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:06,752
Have you given me a choice?

164
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:09,155
Believe it or not,
we want the same things:

165
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:12,959
Taxpayers safe,
bad guys behind bars.

166
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,561
I just wanna make sure
we're going about it the same way.

167
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:24,637
I know you blame me for Terry's death.
It was my command.

168
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:28,174
-I deserve that.
-Yeah, you do.

169
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,276
But what happened that night...

170
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:34,680
...if I could change it, I would.

171
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:37,116
I can't.

172
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:41,354
Neither can you.

173
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,750
You gotta be shitting me.

174
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:15,554
You're a cop.
Why couldn't you call it in?

175
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:18,491
-It's complicated. Police issues.
-What's that mean?

176
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:21,827
You have no idea how bad
I need for you to be quiet right now.

177
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:25,498
-We've been down this block 3 times.
-Unless you see a black Navigator...

178
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:27,400
...there should be nothing
coming out of your mouth.

179
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:30,436
-Black Navigator...
-Not funny!

180
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:32,605
-No, a black Navigator.
-It's not funny!

181
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:34,073
Hey.

182
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:38,978
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey, pull over!

183
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:43,816
Pull... I'm a cop!
I'm a police officer!

184
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:45,684
Pull...
I swear to God.

185
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:49,388
-Pull over! Hey! Pull over! Pull over!
-Shane.

186
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:52,158
-Pull over right now! Goddamn it!
-My God.

187
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:54,093
-Pull your car over!
-Shane.

188
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:57,463
Pull over! Right there!
Pull over! Yeah!

189
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:59,799
Stay there. Right there.
You, come here!

190
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:02,068
You understand English?
Come here.

191
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:05,237
-Right now.
-Take the truck, man! Just take it!

192
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,540
-Don't shoot us, dude.
-Shut up. I'm a cop.

193
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,675
What'd we do?

194
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:12,812
You stole a police vehicle,
you little shitheads.

195
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:14,680
It's my mom's car.

196
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:32,531
Tampons. No.

197
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:40,439
What? What?

198
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,478
-Let me do that.
-I got it.

199
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:48,514
-You make it too strong.
-Okay.

200
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:50,683
You're up early.

201
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:53,252
Thought I heard Matthew
having a nightmare last night.

202
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:55,221
-Did you hear Cassidy coughing?
-No.

203
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:57,556
I think she's getting
what the baby had.

204
00:15:57,556 --> 00:15:59,558
-The doctor's at 3:30.
-I know.

205
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,700
-Hey.
-Hey.

206
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,568
-Good morning, Corrine.
-Morning.

207
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:14,874
-What are you doing here?
-I kind of lost the truck last night.

208
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:18,978
You know,
the one with the stuff inside.

209
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,112
What?

210
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:23,449
I'm gonna go check on Cassidy.

211
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,253
-You lost the Navigator?
-Somebody stole it.

212
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:29,421
-With the drugs inside.
-Yeah.

213
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:33,058
-Where were you?
-At Amy's.

214
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:36,028
You stopped to get laid?
What the hell were you thinking?

215
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:37,930
I was thinking about getting laid.

216
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:41,367
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry doesn't cut it.

217
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:44,270
I was wrong.

218
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:52,244
-So, what do you wanna do now?
-We got about four more hours...

219
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:55,181
...before that truck is
on the way to Mexico City...

220
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:58,017
...in about 10,000 pieces,
and our score's out on the street.

221
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:01,987
Call Lem and Ronnie,
get them to the clubhouse.

222
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:03,889
Nobody steals from us.

223
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,627
That quick, it had to be a pro.

224
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:10,530
-It's being chopped as we speak.
-So they have the drugs.

225
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:13,566
-And I'm out 50 K.
-We're all out 50 K.

226
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:16,035
Maybe they're just
letting it cool off.

227
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,904
You hold onto
that little dream.

228
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:21,140
Go to Rondell.
Tell him what happened.

229
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,043
-Tell him what happened?
-He'll hear about it anyway.

230
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,079
-All right.
-You, come with me.

231
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:31,384
I can't wait to tell Rondell.

232
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,858
Vic, my man.

233
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,428
-Officer Hoffman.
-Vic.

234
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,265
-Hollywood.
-What's up, Hoff.

235
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:48,234
-What you got yourself?
-Green Jeep.

236
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:52,872
Had a couple nibbles, no bites.
What can I do you for?

237
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:54,941
-Who's chopping the big trucks?
-What kind?

238
00:17:54,941 --> 00:17:56,309
-Navigator.
-Year?

239
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:59,913
-Brand new.
-2002 Lincoln Navigator.

240
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:03,516
A few places offhand. Currently the
demand is greater than the supply.

241
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:06,719
-Where's demand the greatest?
-Hold on, hold on.

242
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:13,493
Slow day.

243
00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:18,431
Look, main shop is in your part of
town where they chops those monsters.

244
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:24,304
Skinny Polish prick. Mark Wojo...
Wojohowitz or something like that.

245
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:27,607
-Don't tell him I sent you.
-Thanks, man. I owe you.

246
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,642
If you need another guy
on your team, man...

247
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:33,646
...maybe you'll toss my name
in the hat. I could use the action.

248
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:38,084
Who knows? Might be a new spot
opening up any day now.

249
00:18:38,651 --> 00:18:39,953
Well, all right.

250
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:43,623
So many rocks, so little time.

251
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,692
Nothing like the bust
last night, though?

252
00:18:45,692 --> 00:18:47,193
That was a big one.

253
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:50,430
-What was the final score on that one?
-Four bricks.

254
00:18:51,197 --> 00:18:52,932
Four?

255
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:56,002
Mackey sure knows how
to pull them out of his ass.

256
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:58,104
You might as well talk to us.

257
00:18:58,104 --> 00:19:01,541
We've got four cops who saw you
blow your buddy's brains out.

258
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:02,875
You know what that means?

259
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,078
One of them could
get hit by a bus and we'd...

260
00:19:05,078 --> 00:19:09,215
Still have three cops who could
put you away for first-degree murder.

261
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:12,385
You listening to me?
Add that to the trafficking...

262
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:16,289
Charge and, well, your prospects
aren't looking too pretty.

263
00:19:17,557 --> 00:19:19,859
<i>Tell me where you
</i>got the drugs.

264
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:23,229
<i>Tell me about your buddy Margos,
</i>and his drug connections.

265
00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:25,865
<i>-You listening to me?
</i>-I say something funny?

266
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:29,669
<i>What if I stuffed big blue bananas
</i>in your ears and set them on fire?

267
00:19:31,104 --> 00:19:32,839
<i>Any of this getting through?</i>

268
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:37,276
This guy ignores me almost as much
as my kids did in high school.

269
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:40,647
-Nothing?
-No one's talking.

270
00:19:41,214 --> 00:19:44,784
-They're all terrified of him.
-Anything on the prints?

271
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:48,855
Only Dizarian's came up on Interpol.
Lokely's got a Glendale address.

272
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:51,324
He's been questioned,
but not charged in...

273
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:54,427
-...Kosovo, Bogot? Sri Lanka.
-Frequent flier.

274
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:59,365
He just came back from a 36-hour
holiday from Chiclayo, Peru.

275
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:00,767
Harvest-time.

276
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:03,269
-Get a warrant to search his place.
-Yeah.

277
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:06,139
<i>Revenge? Crime of passion?</i>

278
00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:09,375
He insult your mother?
Having a bad hair day?

279
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:11,711
Let me know if I'm getting warm.

280
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:20,119
-Yeah.
-This Universal Studios?

281
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:25,091
-What? No.
-What, you mean this ain't City Walk?

282
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:27,560
-Are you guys for real?
-Looky here.

283
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,496
Looks like a vehicle being
stripped for illegal distribution.

284
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:32,632
I'll be damned.
In plain sight too.

285
00:20:32,632 --> 00:20:35,301
-It's a good thing we're policemen.
-No way.

286
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:38,171
Think that Universal thing's
gonna hold up in court?

287
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:42,108
Well, maybe, maybe not.
In the meantime, it looks like...

288
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:44,544
...we'll have to return these
to their owners...

289
00:20:44,544 --> 00:20:46,946
...and bring you in,
Polish prick Mark.

290
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:51,050
-All right, what do you guys want?
-Blue Navigator.

291
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:53,820
-Don't have one.
-You get any offers last night?

292
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:56,823
Answer the question.

293
00:20:56,823 --> 00:20:59,792
-I get to keep these?
-If you make me happy.

294
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:03,162
A guy Ricardo called.
Wanted to unload a Navigator.

295
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:08,835
-Ricardo have an address?
-Yeah. He's in Silver Lake.

296
00:21:08,835 --> 00:21:11,404
Where in Silver Lake, asshole?

297
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:30,056
Must like you, officer. It's the first
thing this faggot's said all day.

298
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:42,168
-Hey, Dutch.
-Hey.

299
00:21:42,168 --> 00:21:44,370
You interviewed that Armenian, right?

300
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:47,206
"Interview" would imply that
a conversation took place.

301
00:21:47,206 --> 00:21:49,942
-This guy didn't say a word.
-He did to me.

302
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:51,544
-When?
-Just now.

303
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:53,913
-What'd he say?
-I guess it was Armenian.

304
00:21:53,913 --> 00:21:57,350
It sounded something
like "hamal v otcar."

305
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:04,056
-Hamal v otcar.
-Hamal v otcar.

306
00:22:04,624 --> 00:22:07,827
-You okay?
-Yeah. That guy just creeps me out.

307
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,595
Don't let him.
He's behind bars.

308
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:11,197
-I'll check on this.
-Thanks.

309
00:22:16,903 --> 00:22:18,171
What the hell?

310
00:22:20,306 --> 00:22:21,974
-Who are you guys?
-Shut up.

311
00:22:21,974 --> 00:22:23,643
I'm trying to sleep here.

312
00:22:23,643 --> 00:22:26,412
Where's the Navigator
you tried to unload last night?

313
00:22:26,412 --> 00:22:27,914
How'd you get in my bedroom?

314
00:22:33,653 --> 00:22:35,922
Look, I didn't jack it.
It was Dina.

315
00:22:35,922 --> 00:22:37,123
Who's Dina?

316
00:22:37,123 --> 00:22:38,858
Girl I'm trying to
break into the game.

317
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:40,326
He's trying to bone.

318
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:45,131
-Where can we find Dina?
-Who are you guys?

319
00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:50,436
Hey, call Lem and Ronnie and
have them bring you over to Dina's.

320
00:22:50,436 --> 00:22:52,705
-Where are you going?
-I got somewhere to go.

321
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:55,041
-Where?
-You're not exactly...

322
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:57,310
...in a position to question
my decisions.

323
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:59,879
Just call me when you
have Dina or the drugs.

324
00:23:03,616 --> 00:23:06,786
-Officer Sofer.
-Detective Mackey.

325
00:23:06,786 --> 00:23:09,589
-What you got there?
-Notes.

326
00:23:09,589 --> 00:23:12,425
Sergeant's exam.
Dutch is gonna help me out.

327
00:23:12,425 --> 00:23:15,528
Dutchman isn't pulling the old
I'll-help-you-study...

328
00:23:15,528 --> 00:23:18,297
...you-help-me-get-laid
manoeuvre, is he?

329
00:23:18,297 --> 00:23:19,966
He'd like to help me pass.

330
00:23:19,966 --> 00:23:22,368
He'd like to help you
out of your pants.

331
00:23:27,173 --> 00:23:29,809
Last night, Shane ran in
for a Slurpee and managed...

332
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:32,411
...to get our police-issue
vehicle jacked.

333
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:35,781
-Ouch.
-Yeah. Had our weapons in it too.

334
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:38,985
That stuff hits the street and gets
traced back to us...

335
00:23:38,985 --> 00:23:42,755
...Aceveda will put Shane's balls
in a vice. And mine too, probably.

336
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:47,026
-What's the vehicle?
-2002 blue Navigator, fully loaded.

337
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:49,862
I'd like to bring it in
personally, quietly.

338
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:52,531
Keep my eye open
and give you the heads up.

339
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:53,666
Thanks.

340
00:23:55,334 --> 00:23:58,905
So is that what Shane's calling it
these days, a Slurpee?

341
00:23:58,905 --> 00:24:00,373
I guess so.

342
00:24:06,345 --> 00:24:08,948
Detective Wyms, I was hoping
I could talk to you.

343
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:11,050
-About?
-Advice.

344
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:13,819
Well, shouldn't you be going
to your P-3 for advice?

345
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:15,354
I'd rather talk to you.

346
00:24:16,222 --> 00:24:18,925
-Why? Because I'm black?
-No.

347
00:24:18,925 --> 00:24:21,727
Better not be because
I remind you of your mother.

348
00:24:22,328 --> 00:24:23,663
No, ma'am.

349
00:24:24,931 --> 00:24:26,632
I mean, detective.

350
00:24:29,101 --> 00:24:31,604
Never mind. I'm sorry
to have bothered you.

351
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:33,940
Officer.

352
00:24:38,044 --> 00:24:39,312
What is it?

353
00:24:40,513 --> 00:24:44,250
I think I may have seen another cop
do something illegal on the job.

354
00:24:44,717 --> 00:24:47,853
-And?
-And I don't know what to do about it.

355
00:24:51,324 --> 00:24:56,796
You're talking about jeopardizing
two careers here: His and yours.

356
00:24:58,564 --> 00:24:59,765
Mine?

357
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:03,769
Nobody likes a rat, especially one
who hasn't proven himself.

358
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:07,006
-So I should keep this to myself.
-No, I didn't say that.

359
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,775
You gotta ask yourself
if it's something...

360
00:25:09,775 --> 00:25:12,178
...bad enough to risk
that kind of heat.

361
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:14,747
Is it something you can't
live with holding?

362
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:20,419
You're certain there
were six bricks?

363
00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:23,522
Six or seven.
Definitely more than four.

364
00:25:26,325 --> 00:25:29,295
-You did the right thing.
-Yeah.

365
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:33,833
-I know it wasn't easy.
-No, sir.

366
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:37,470
We'd be a lot better off with more
men like you and fewer like Mackey.

367
00:25:38,838 --> 00:25:40,373
So, what happens now?

368
00:25:43,676 --> 00:25:47,146
Can you check on when
the blue Navigator was checked in?

369
00:25:47,146 --> 00:25:48,948
Don't have to. Wasn't.

370
00:25:48,948 --> 00:25:52,451
Supposed to be in five hours ago.
Wilshire's been asking for it back.

371
00:25:55,821 --> 00:25:59,959
-He's supposed to be the best.
-They say that about every doctor.

372
00:26:04,163 --> 00:26:06,499
-Yeah.
<i>-Is Shane with you?</i>

373
00:26:06,499 --> 00:26:08,300
No. Why?

374
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,203
<i>Just got a complaint from a woman
</i>who said a police officer...

375
00:26:11,203 --> 00:26:14,807
...fitting Shane's description,
assaulted her son at gunpoint...

376
00:26:14,807 --> 00:26:16,642
...claiming he stole
a police vehicle.

377
00:26:16,642 --> 00:26:18,878
You sure she's not
some crackpot?

378
00:26:18,878 --> 00:26:21,580
<i>Where's that blue Navigator
</i>you signed out last night?

379
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,016
Don't know.
I'll ask Shane when I see him.

380
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:27,420
<i>-I need that truck back now.
</i>-Loud and clear. Gotta run.

381
00:26:27,887 --> 00:26:29,355
-Sorry.
-Quite all right.

382
00:26:29,355 --> 00:26:30,956
Why don't you both have a seat.

383
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,663
So, Mr. And Mrs. Mackey,
how are you both doing today?

384
00:26:37,663 --> 00:26:40,066
You tell us.
How'd the testing go?

385
00:26:40,066 --> 00:26:43,135
The past three sessions have
gone well. You're very lucky.

386
00:26:43,135 --> 00:26:45,571
Matthew is a charming,
intelligent little boy.

387
00:26:47,173 --> 00:26:49,108
He also has autism.

388
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,312
-What?
-Autism.

389
00:26:54,513 --> 00:26:56,715
-God.
-Wait a minute.

390
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:02,321
He's a little shy, behind a bit...

391
00:27:02,321 --> 00:27:05,291
...but autism? Jesus.

392
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:08,561
What does that mean?

393
00:27:08,561 --> 00:27:11,864
It's a hard word to hear, but it's
also a very misunderstood word.

394
00:27:11,864 --> 00:27:15,868
-Matthew's a beautiful child. He's...
-I know my son is beautiful.

395
00:27:15,868 --> 00:27:18,204
-I understand what you're feeling.
-Really.

396
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:20,806
I have two autistic boys of my own.

397
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:22,942
-Two?
-Man.

398
00:27:22,942 --> 00:27:26,145
Yes. I felt everything
you're feeling twice.

399
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:27,880
What's gonna happen to him?

400
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,783
-He's going to grow up.
-What about school?

401
00:27:30,783 --> 00:27:32,952
He may be best served
in a special program.

402
00:27:32,952 --> 00:27:37,323
Special? What do you mean, like
blue-bus special? That's not my kid.

403
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:42,128
I mean, look at him.
He's just Matt.

404
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:44,396
I knew something was wrong.

405
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:47,900
He could stay in his present
school with some speech therapy...

406
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:52,571
-...and special-skills instruction.
-Is he gonna be normal or not?

407
00:27:52,571 --> 00:27:53,939
With the proper support,...

408
00:27:53,939 --> 00:27:56,442
...he will be able to make gains
to the best of his ability.

409
00:27:56,442 --> 00:27:59,278
And with intervention,
the prognosis is very good.

410
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:02,348
He's just gonna need a lot of love
and work to get there.

411
00:28:02,348 --> 00:28:04,817
He's got the love.
What kind of work?

412
00:28:05,251 --> 00:28:08,521
Jesus. I'm sorry. I'm a cop.

413
00:28:09,588 --> 00:28:11,957
-What?
<i>-We are so screwed, man.</i>

414
00:28:11,957 --> 00:28:15,127
<i>Aceveda just put a statewide
</i>APB out on the Navigator.

415
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,671
What's up?

416
00:28:25,671 --> 00:28:29,441
Roommate said this Dina girl went to
go get waxed. She didn't know where.

417
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:31,877
-You got anything more vague?
-What should we do?

418
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:35,681
Aceveda gets ahold of this truck, he's
gonna do a chem match on the blow...

419
00:28:35,681 --> 00:28:37,650
...our fingerprints
are all over the bricks.

420
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:40,019
We'll all crash and burn
because of you!

421
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:41,820
Christ, Amy's not even that hot.

422
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,355
-Come on, Lem.
-No, bull!

423
00:28:43,355 --> 00:28:44,857
He's right.
You boned us.

424
00:28:44,857 --> 00:28:46,825
Thank you for the
support, assholes!

425
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:48,160
Cut it out!

426
00:28:49,528 --> 00:28:50,629
We're not going down.

427
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,566
-You understand me?
-Yeah, yeah.

428
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:56,835
All right. Ronnie, you stay here
and wait for Dina.

429
00:28:56,835 --> 00:29:00,072
Lem, they got a bunch of those
wax places over on Olvera Street.

430
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:02,875
We'll check the muff rippers
over in Little Tokyo. Let's go.

431
00:29:10,116 --> 00:29:12,585
Well, if the DA is not gonna file...

432
00:29:17,724 --> 00:29:19,759
-You check out Margos' place?
-Yeah.

433
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:23,396
You think this guy was spooky before,
you should see the way he lives.

434
00:29:23,396 --> 00:29:25,598
-What'd you find?
-Nothing incriminating.

435
00:29:25,598 --> 00:29:29,736
Just a couple hundred maps,
six dictionaries in five languages.

436
00:29:29,736 --> 00:29:33,906
-Scanner, digital camera, GameBoy.
-Incense, meditation books.

437
00:29:33,906 --> 00:29:37,677
-Disposable diapers.
-A whole case of microwave popcorn.

438
00:29:37,677 --> 00:29:39,812
-Hey, no microwave.
-No microwave.

439
00:29:39,812 --> 00:29:43,182
-No fridge, no stove.
-No plates, silverware.

440
00:29:43,182 --> 00:29:44,617
-No soap.
-No toilet paper.

441
00:29:44,617 --> 00:29:45,718
No more.

442
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:48,588
This guy just gets better and better.

443
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,558
-Break almost over?
-Yeah.

444
00:29:53,092 --> 00:29:55,094
Did you get a chance
to look at those notes?

445
00:29:55,094 --> 00:29:56,629
A little.

446
00:29:56,629 --> 00:29:59,332
A lot of stuff to absorb.
Don't put it off too long.

447
00:29:59,332 --> 00:30:00,633
I won't.

448
00:30:01,134 --> 00:30:03,569
Hey, Dutch, any luck
with that translation?

449
00:30:05,605 --> 00:30:08,741
You know, it's a phonetic spelling.

450
00:30:08,741 --> 00:30:11,444
Armenians have this
Eastern-Western dialect thing.

451
00:30:11,444 --> 00:30:14,847
-What did your guy say that it meant?
-This is by no means definitive.

452
00:30:14,847 --> 00:30:17,583
But what Margos may have
been saying was...

453
00:30:19,852 --> 00:30:22,955
-...delicious feet.
-Excuse me?

454
00:30:22,955 --> 00:30:26,926
-Delicious feet, yeah.
-God.

455
00:30:26,926 --> 00:30:28,795
You probably just
heard him wrong.

456
00:30:38,738 --> 00:30:39,939
Hey, hey.

457
00:30:46,979 --> 00:30:48,347
Let's go.

458
00:30:50,783 --> 00:30:52,285
Don't move.

459
00:30:53,953 --> 00:30:55,655
Jesus.

460
00:30:57,456 --> 00:30:59,058
He snapped his neck.

461
00:31:00,459 --> 00:31:05,097
Let me guess. You're not talking.
Get them out of here.

462
00:31:05,097 --> 00:31:08,100
And call Central, have them
get this guy out of my building.

463
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:11,704
Step outside the car by opening
the door from the outside.

464
00:31:11,704 --> 00:31:13,005
Okay.

465
00:31:15,575 --> 00:31:17,944
-Sorry.
-Step outside.

466
00:31:22,648 --> 00:31:24,417
-I'm so sorry.
-Turn around.

467
00:31:24,417 --> 00:31:26,619
-Put your hands on the window.
-Look, I...

468
00:31:26,619 --> 00:31:29,388
I know it's not your problem, okay...

469
00:31:29,989 --> 00:31:33,159
...but I'm sorry.
My dad's drinking again...

470
00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:36,529
...and I had to grab my brother
and bolt out of there this morning.

471
00:31:36,529 --> 00:31:39,999
It was so crazy.
God, I was so scared.

472
00:31:40,967 --> 00:31:44,470
Well, sorry. Listen, is there anything
we can do for you?

473
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,639
Yeah. I just need to
pick up my brother...

474
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:48,574
...at school before
my dad gets there.

475
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:50,743
I mean, God knows
what he'll do to him.

476
00:31:50,743 --> 00:31:52,178
If you could just let me go...

477
00:31:52,178 --> 00:31:56,148
Always pick up your abused brother
in a stolen vehicle with bogus plates?

478
00:31:59,018 --> 00:32:00,253
Damn.

479
00:32:00,253 --> 00:32:03,222
-One Tango 13, copy?
-Hey, hold up on that.

480
00:32:03,222 --> 00:32:05,324
Stand by. What?

481
00:32:05,324 --> 00:32:08,327
Told Vic I'd give him the heads up
when we found the Navigator.

482
00:32:08,327 --> 00:32:09,962
-What for?
-I don't know.

483
00:32:09,962 --> 00:32:11,864
He wants to be the
one to bring it in.

484
00:32:11,864 --> 00:32:13,866
It's an APB. We have to call it in.

485
00:32:13,866 --> 00:32:16,702
Look, I owe Vic one. Hey!

486
00:32:17,403 --> 00:32:18,771
Where are you going?

487
00:32:18,771 --> 00:32:21,207
You two look like you
needed some alone time.

488
00:32:21,941 --> 00:32:23,542
Get in the car.

489
00:32:25,478 --> 00:32:29,282
One Tango 13, we have a confirmation
on that stolen Navigator.

490
00:32:29,282 --> 00:32:33,052
Roger, Tango 13.
I'll notify the watch commander.

491
00:32:33,052 --> 00:32:36,489
I can't risk a bad mark on my jacket
this early in my career.

492
00:32:50,603 --> 00:32:51,737
Anything touched?

493
00:32:51,737 --> 00:32:54,240
No, sir, we secured the scene
and made the call.

494
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,574
Okay.

495
00:33:01,147 --> 00:33:02,348
Lock box.

496
00:33:11,958 --> 00:33:13,092
Nothing.

497
00:33:16,629 --> 00:33:18,097
Goddamn it.

498
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:26,405
He called it in before
I could stop him.

499
00:33:26,405 --> 00:33:28,341
-Are you kidding me?
-What's his problem?

500
00:33:28,341 --> 00:33:30,276
Look, he's just learning.

501
00:33:30,276 --> 00:33:33,012
Look, the good news is
they didn't find those weapons.

502
00:33:33,012 --> 00:33:36,148
-Did he find anything?
-Just Dina.

503
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:40,119
Looks like I located
your missing truck.

504
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:42,021
Was hoping I'd save you the trouble.

505
00:33:43,122 --> 00:33:46,425
-All's well that ends well.
-Yeah.

506
00:33:54,066 --> 00:33:57,069
-You're in deep, Dina.
-Yeah?

507
00:33:57,069 --> 00:34:00,439
Shoplifting, assault.
Now grand-theft auto.

508
00:34:01,007 --> 00:34:03,943
-What's next?
-Thinking about the police academy.

509
00:34:03,943 --> 00:34:06,746
Why don't you go
get me an application.

510
00:34:07,513 --> 00:34:12,084
You think this is a game, little girl?
This is real time in real prison.

511
00:34:12,084 --> 00:34:15,855
Okay. Are you going somewhere
with this scared-straight angle?

512
00:34:15,855 --> 00:34:19,892
Or is this where I tell you how my
daddy used to crawl into bed with me?

513
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:26,065
I wanna know what
you found in the Navigator.

514
00:34:27,767 --> 00:34:29,602
I heard someone call you "captain."

515
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:33,606
I mean, isn't a stolen car case
normally a little below your radar?

516
00:34:34,373 --> 00:34:35,608
You wouldn't be here...

517
00:34:35,608 --> 00:34:38,244
-...if I didn't have what you wanted.
-Where are the drugs?

518
00:34:40,546 --> 00:34:41,914
They're safe.

519
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:44,917
Tell me where, and I'll make sure
the auto theft goes away.

520
00:34:46,752 --> 00:34:52,358
Until I see it, I don't say it.
In writing, signed by the DA.

521
00:35:09,275 --> 00:35:13,079
-Hey. That the car thief stuff?
-Yeah.

522
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:15,815
Hey, I hear you're
looking for another stripe.

523
00:35:17,483 --> 00:35:20,786
-Yeah. See you.
-All right. Good luck.

524
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:21,987
Thanks.

525
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:25,524
She made three phone calls
after she stole the truck.

526
00:35:25,524 --> 00:35:29,428
Two to her roommates and the other
to a pawnshop in Echo Park.

527
00:35:30,596 --> 00:35:34,800
-Pemble &amp; Pemble on Esther.
-Head for Esther in Echo Park.

528
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,504
-Man, do I owe you one.
-Please. At best, I'm even.

529
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:44,210
Stop staring at my feet,
you Balkan freak.

530
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:47,780
-"What"?
-Nothing.

531
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:50,082
Danny. Come with us.

532
00:35:53,352 --> 00:35:56,088
I think Aceveda got Dina to talk.
I gotta go.

533
00:35:56,522 --> 00:35:58,457
-Damn it.
-What?

534
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,662
Hey, man, we're not closed yet.

535
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:08,601
Yo, sprechen sie Englisch, skinhead?
I said, we're not closed yet.

536
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:21,480
In 30 seconds I'll either know
what I wanna know or you'll be dead.

537
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,315
-Dina.
-I don't know a Dina.

538
00:36:23,315 --> 00:36:26,085
-How come you have our guns here?
-Talk!

539
00:36:26,085 --> 00:36:28,220
-Dina called for Freddy.
-Who's Freddy?

540
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:31,123
French guy.
Helps me out with the night traffic.

541
00:36:31,123 --> 00:36:34,026
-Where are the drugs?
-I don't know. Maybe Freddy took them.

542
00:36:34,026 --> 00:36:35,528
Not good enough!

543
00:36:37,663 --> 00:36:39,665
I swear to God, man, I don't know!

544
00:36:39,665 --> 00:36:43,102
Why would I cover for him?
Jesus Christ, he's French.

545
00:36:43,102 --> 00:36:45,070
Where can we find the frog?

546
00:37:08,161 --> 00:37:10,129
Looks like Freddy
couldn't hold his sugar.

547
00:37:10,129 --> 00:37:11,431
Power of the pink.

548
00:37:12,365 --> 00:37:15,001
-Blew a goddamn vessel.
-That's nasty.

549
00:37:15,568 --> 00:37:18,938
All right, go through this place. Make
sure there's nothing here to tie us.

550
00:37:22,141 --> 00:37:25,111
Vic! It's Aceveda.

551
00:37:25,111 --> 00:37:28,181
Hey, let's clean up Freddy!
Here we go.

552
00:37:28,181 --> 00:37:32,886
-Shit. Clean him up.
-Wipe it all down.

553
00:37:32,886 --> 00:37:36,222
Tray. Here's the tray.
Here's the tray. Coming through.

554
00:37:38,558 --> 00:37:40,426
Yeah, yeah. Is that it?

555
00:37:42,662 --> 00:37:45,532
All right, all right.
Run this. Good, good.

556
00:37:45,532 --> 00:37:47,800
-You got it?
-Clean fingers.

557
00:37:49,869 --> 00:37:54,040
-What's going on here?
-It must've been a hell of a party.

558
00:37:58,344 --> 00:38:02,048
-What happened to him?
-Looks like an OD. Found him that way.

559
00:38:02,048 --> 00:38:05,852
<i>-Been dead a while. Really dead.
</i>-Yeah. We were about to call it in.

560
00:38:05,852 --> 00:38:10,123
<i>You were about to call it in.
</i>What are you doing here?

561
00:38:10,123 --> 00:38:14,460
<i>Fair question. Tracking down the guns
</i>from our stolen ride.

562
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,963
Yep. All's here and
accounted for, sir.

563
00:38:16,963 --> 00:38:18,731
Can't have them hitting the streets.

564
00:38:22,936 --> 00:38:25,605
-Didn't want them in the wrong hands.
-Where's Mackey?

565
00:38:28,174 --> 00:38:31,511
Hey. Thought he wouldn't mind
if I used the can.

566
00:38:33,513 --> 00:38:34,914
What are you doing there, captain?

567
00:38:35,415 --> 00:38:37,417
I'm looking for something.

568
00:38:45,758 --> 00:38:48,361
-Where is it?
-Don't know what you're talking about.

569
00:38:48,895 --> 00:38:52,632
Hey, treat yourself to a full
cavity search if you like.

570
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:05,912
I'll see you back at the barn.

571
00:39:18,391 --> 00:39:19,792
Turn it inside out.

572
00:39:20,693 --> 00:39:21,928
Every inch.

573
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:31,037
-I thought you were working.
-Yeah. I gotta go back.

574
00:39:31,037 --> 00:39:32,872
Just snuck out
to tuck in little man.

575
00:39:32,872 --> 00:39:34,707
Better hurry.
He might already be asleep.

576
00:39:34,707 --> 00:39:35,808
Okay.

577
00:39:37,243 --> 00:39:38,411
How you doing?

578
00:39:38,411 --> 00:39:40,747
I'm all right. I'm
just a little tired.

579
00:39:40,747 --> 00:39:44,851
Yeah. I know.
Don't worry, we'll get through this.

580
00:40:10,009 --> 00:40:11,778
What did you get for 38?

581
00:40:16,482 --> 00:40:18,084
I answered C.

582
00:40:18,084 --> 00:40:19,585
No, it's B.

583
00:40:19,585 --> 00:40:22,989
Have to report the infraction
immediately to the commanding officer.

584
00:40:22,989 --> 00:40:26,059
-There's no latitude on that.
-Stupid rule.

585
00:40:28,461 --> 00:40:31,230
Would you turn in your partner
on something like that?

586
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:33,099
I know how I'd answer on the test.

587
00:40:34,701 --> 00:40:38,705
Hello? Hi.
No, are you okay?

588
00:40:39,572 --> 00:40:42,542
No, come on over. Okay.

589
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:45,778
-Everything all right?
-Yeah.

590
00:40:46,512 --> 00:40:50,149
A friend of mine is having a crisis
and she wants to come over.

591
00:40:50,149 --> 00:40:53,152
-She okay?
-I don't know.

592
00:40:54,821 --> 00:40:57,523
-We got a lot of work done tonight.
-Yeah.

593
00:41:00,226 --> 00:41:01,761
Hey, you're a good teacher.

594
00:41:03,763 --> 00:41:06,099
-See you tomorrow?
-Yeah.

595
00:41:06,099 --> 00:41:08,968
We'll dive into administrative
and procedural.

596
00:41:08,968 --> 00:41:11,938
It's dry stuff, but you can't pass
without nailing it.

597
00:41:17,009 --> 00:41:20,213
-Good night.
-Night. I hope your friend's okay.

598
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,648
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

599
00:41:22,648 --> 00:41:23,950
Okay.

600
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:25,785
Thanks.

601
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:30,156
Sorry about today, it was
such a faggot thing to do.

602
00:41:30,156 --> 00:41:31,657
Showing up at your work.

603
00:41:32,825 --> 00:41:34,160
Don't do it again.

604
00:41:35,762 --> 00:41:36,896
I won't.

605
00:41:38,231 --> 00:41:39,398
You gonna sit?

606
00:41:43,102 --> 00:41:44,837
I really am sorry.

607
00:41:47,473 --> 00:41:49,008
I'll make it up to you.

608
00:41:49,008 --> 00:41:53,546
I can't be the person that you want me
to be. I shouldn't even be here.

609
00:41:56,349 --> 00:41:59,652
-You've never come back, have you?
-This is stupid.

610
00:41:59,652 --> 00:42:01,721
What's stupid are the
late-night cruises...

611
00:42:01,721 --> 00:42:04,223
...and anonymous hummers
in your car.

612
00:42:08,928 --> 00:42:10,096
What?

613
00:42:10,897 --> 00:42:12,632
I read a page of your diary?

614
00:42:13,432 --> 00:42:14,934
You don't know anything about me.

615
00:42:15,401 --> 00:42:18,738
Things that I believe,
things that I see.

616
00:42:18,738 --> 00:42:20,973
-You're a good person.
-I'm doing a bad thing.

617
00:42:20,973 --> 00:42:22,675
You deserve to be happy.

618
00:42:22,675 --> 00:42:24,143
You ever read the Bible?

619
00:42:25,244 --> 00:42:26,813
Scripture teaches...

620
00:42:31,384 --> 00:42:32,552
Never mind.

621
00:42:33,653 --> 00:42:35,154
You came back.

622
00:42:37,657 --> 00:42:39,458
Start listening to yourself.

623
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:10,153
-You're here late.
-I'm e-mailing my girls.

624
00:43:10,153 --> 00:43:11,755
Just got a call from Central.

625
00:43:12,222 --> 00:43:14,825
Margos Dizarian
escaped from the paddy wagon.

626
00:43:16,059 --> 00:43:18,328
What? How?

627
00:43:18,328 --> 00:43:23,133
Jimmied open the back door, dove out
at 40 miles an hour in his cuffs.

628
00:43:23,867 --> 00:43:26,837
-Disappeared down an alley.
-Jesus.

629
00:43:28,071 --> 00:43:31,041
-I know.
-That's a special kind of crazy.

630
00:43:31,575 --> 00:43:35,078
Very special.
Just thought you should know.

631
00:43:35,078 --> 00:43:39,516
I wish I didn't.
God knows where he is right now.

632
00:43:47,891 --> 00:43:49,059
You okay?

633
00:43:49,726 --> 00:43:51,161
Not really.

634
00:43:52,996 --> 00:43:55,432
I'm just kind of all over the place.

635
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:59,603
-Job?
-Yeah. And I...

636
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:03,640
Brutal day.

637
00:44:15,919 --> 00:44:17,120
Where are you?

638
00:44:18,722 --> 00:44:19,923
I don't know.

639
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:26,162
I got something going on with my kid.

640
00:44:29,533 --> 00:44:30,767
You don't wanna hear it.

641
00:44:33,436 --> 00:44:35,105
Let's talk about something else.

642
00:44:37,641 --> 00:44:38,642
Yeah.

643
00:44:57,093 --> 00:44:59,763
You've gotta be shitting me.
