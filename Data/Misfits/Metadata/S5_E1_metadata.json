He reluctantly complies. Back at the Centre Finn meets Lucy, one of a group of Scouts, who seems attracted to him but the group are in fact Satanists who force him to join them as an agent of the devil and commit demonic acts. When holy water fails to cure there is only one solution - Alex takes him from behind, which lifts the curse and saves Jess's life but lands him on Community Service. Meanwhile Rudy 2, against the advice of the original Rudy, joins a self-help group for those possessed of super-powers . Its leader, Maggie, is an elderly lady who knits the future, in Rudy's case a jumper which foretells that he and his friends will become super-heroes.\u2014don @ minifie-1"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "2805132", "rating": 7.3, "votes": 569, "number_of_episodes": 38}
