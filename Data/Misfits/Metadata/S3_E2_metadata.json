He is replaced in the team by ladies' man Rudy, an old flame of Alisha, who has the ability to twin himself - somewhat unwittingly - when stressed. This incurs the wrath of pick-up Tanya who believes he is two-timing her and who gets her revenge by killing Charlie, the girl she saw Rudy kissing, and framing him for the murder. Fortunately the second Rudy comes to the rescue after Tanya is accidentally killed and once more the misfits find themselves burying two bodies and hoping to get away with it.\u2014don @ minifie-1"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "1934753", "rating": 7.3, "votes": 1078, "number_of_episodes": 38}
